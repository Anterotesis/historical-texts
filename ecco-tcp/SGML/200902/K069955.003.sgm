<HEAD>LETTER LVI.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE purpo&s;ely put off, hitherto, one important but di&s;a&s;trous &s;ubject, to the la&s;t moment; although I have now for the &s;pace of &s;ome years, in my different traver&s;ings of the continent, been placed, as it were, in the very eye and ear of it. You feel that I mean the dreadful public, and yet more fatal private, wars of this and many other countries on this <HI>unhappy</HI> &s;ide of the Engli&s;h Channel.</P>
<P>What, my loved friend, is the matter with them all!</P>
<Q><L>"Sure 'tis the very error of the moon,</L>
<L>"She comes more near the earth than &s;he was wont</L>
<L>"And makes men mad."</L></Q>
<P>Does it proceed from the &s;acred flame of liberty? which exalts the human, almo&s;t to the divine nature; or are the nations filled with
<PB N="2" REF="13">clamours <Q>for that which no man felt the want of, and with care for freedom, which has never been in danger?</Q> Springs it from a due &s;en&s;e of that proud principle within us, which points at the right which every hone&s;t indivi|dual has to rank with the loftie&s;t of the &s;pecies, when mea&s;ured by the &s;tandard of nature? or from that factious and di&s;contented &s;pirit, which prompts the wor&s;t of mankind to trouble the repo&s;e, and plunder the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the be&s;t? Comes it from true patrioti&s;m, or from that party rage, which "robs it of its good name?" It proceeds from all the&s;e. But with re&s;pect to <HI>Equality,</HI> on the literal idea, as the mob are encouraged for rea&s;ons they cannot penetrate, to conceive it, was there ever &s;uch a day-dream? To make the ab&s;urdity more egre|gious, yet more palateable, it is called <HI>natural</HI> equality! Prepo&s;terous as fal&s;e! What, dear friend, in nature is equal? Survey her productions: from the fir&s;t to the la&s;t, from the mo&s;t gigantic to the mo&s;t minute, as well in animals as man, what is there which &s;he has not <HI>created</HI> UNEQUAL, even by expre&s;s order of the Creator? And by that very <HI>inequality</HI> intending to promote the wi&s;dom, force and felicity of the whole? Among&s;t the fi&s;hes of the &s;ea, and the fowls of the air, and the bea&s;ts of the field, the grand
<PB N="3" REF="14">line of &s;ubordination drawn by nature goes on. Would you give to the linnet the wing of the eagle, or to the turn&s;pit the &s;peed of the grey|hound? To what end? Would not nature, by that exchange, be violated in her general laws, and would the beings them&s;elves be the better for it? Am I told, that all the&s;e creatures were put under the &s;ubjection of man, and that he, as the lord of all below, can have naturally no &s;uperior but the God that gave him life. The argument re&s;ts then, it &s;eems, on the natural equality of <HI>human</HI> creatures. Fallacious again. For of all the beings in the &s;cale of the uni|ver&s;e, man, (if we except his origin, concern|ing the <HI>equality</HI> of which he has no more right to be proud, than the worm that devours his carca&s;e), is the mo&s;t &s;ubject to the laws of natural <HI>in</HI>-equality. The point which places him at the top of the creation is certainly his &s;oul; for his body, whether a ma&s;terpiece of beauty, or a ma&s;s of deformity, is alike cor|ruptible, and rather an object of humiliation than triumph. But, were you di&s;po&s;ed to &s;elect, from the diver&s;ified works of nature, any &s;pecimen of her wonderful variety and irregu|larity, could you fix on any thing &s;o proper to di&s;play that irregularity, that variety, as the human mind? So far from there being herein an univer&s;al equality, there is nothing &s;o <HI>une|qual</HI> <PB N="4" REF="15">among&s;t all the performances of Creation. The &s;trength of the lion is not more remote from the feeblene&s;s of the gnat, nor the &s;wift|ne&s;s of the rein-deer from the tardine&s;s of the &s;nail, than the di&s;tance between the power and weakne&s;s, velocity and &s;lowne&s;s of men's &s;ouls and under&s;tandings. Nature, by uncontroula|ble laws, has e&s;tabli&s;hed, that to one man &s;hould be given an head to plan, govern, and command; to another, hands to toil and obey. Innumerable are the gradations, from tho&s;e who guide the helm of the &s;tate, to tho&s;e who regulate the &s;teerage of a &s;imple &s;kiff, from the noble&s;t architect to the mo&s;t ordinary ar|tificer. The harmonies of civil &s;ociety are carried on by the joint a&s;&s;i&s;tance of all the&s;e in their <HI>proper places;</HI> take them out of which, and tran&s;po&s;e them, put the one into the &s;ta|tion of another; and, in &s;hort, jumble them together, on the plea of natural equality, ac|cording to the new &s;y&s;tem, and what re&s;ults from all this? What becomes of civil &s;ociety, and of the world? Doth not &s;uch a farce upon the decent &s;ubordinations and arrange|ments of nature, fill it with di&s;cords, di&s;orders, and death? Look into the page of ancient annals, and into the more &s;anguinary hi&s;tory of modern times&mdash;what do they exhibit but a ti&s;&s;ue of ab&s;urdity, horror, and blood?</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="16">Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that were the&s;e at length to &s;ub&s;ide, by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Republi|cani&s;m on the ruins of Monarchy, that the happine&s;s of mankind, which ought to be the aim and end of all governments, would be the effect? Let the toiling hand govern, and the projecting head obey. Would not confu&s;ion be indeed confounded? Or &s;hall all men have an equal &s;hare in the direction of human affairs? Shall there be no governors, no governed? Shall families, &s;ocieties, &s;tates, and empires be without an head? Shall all be common right, and common fellow&s;hip? The comet, my friend, were it "to ru&s;h lawle&s;s through the void," would not trail &s;o much mi&s;chief in its cour&s;e, as &s;uch a number of licentious orbits out of their proper &s;pheres. The wolves and tygers of the fore&s;ts acknow|ledge, it is true, no &s;uperior, and they &s;ome|times troop, in grim a&s;&s;ociation and fell bandittl, to lay wa&s;te the countries through which they pa&s;s; they are, it mu&s;t be owned, notable re|publicans, and are unanimous to de&s;troy what|ever they meet with; but they de&s;tory each other al&s;o; and are bad examples of the &s;uc|ce&s;s of an univer&s;al republic, in&s;tituted on the levelling principle. The wolves and tygers of human kind, if &s;uffered to roam through the wilderne&s;s of life, without any check on pa&s;|&s;ions <PB N="6" REF="17">more fierce and fatal than any be&s;tial appetite&mdash;or, if controuled only by tho&s;e laws which are in&s;tituted by what are called patriots, only becau&s;e they avowedly differ from and oppo&s;e any order in a creation that is &s;u&s;tained by order only&mdash;would &s;oon make the univer&s;e more intolerable to its inhabitants, than any abu&s;e which power has yet introduced into the government of the world; and the mo&s;t di&s;|loyal being would again call out, like the frogs in the fable, for a king, and rather than any longer be left to the anarchy of being delivered over to them&s;elves, would pray for one tyrant (&s;uppo&s;ing no hone&s;t prince would then accept of them) in exchange for an univer&s;e of de&s;|pots.</P>
<P>But farther, how egregiou&s;ly ab&s;urd, my friend, is this new doctrine! Are not all large bodies of men compelled to have gover|nors and chiefs? And do not the&s;e imply com|mand and obedience? and do not the&s;e argue in their very name and nature, authority and &s;ubjection? What are the Admirals, Generals, Colonels, Captains, and Subalterns of the pre&s;ent French armies, but heads? What are the &s;oldiers and &s;ailors they govern or direct, but &s;ubordi|nate members? In what con&s;i&s;ts the difference betwixt the&s;e and former commanders, whether
<PB N="7" REF="18">mini&s;terial or military? Alas, nothing but "the whi&s;tlings of a name." Call it Ari&s;tocracy, and the gentle&s;t government becomes tyranny: give it the name of Democracy; and there is no &s;lavery too hard to be endured. Nay, the very men who are &s;uch &s;ticklers for equality, who have even fought and bled for it, continue to this very hour to make the proude&s;t di&s;tinctions among&s;t men, even in a &s;tate of mutual captivity. The fir&s;t thing that &s;truck me in my vi&s;it to Weyzel, a celebrated town, as you know, of We&s;tphalia, was the &s;eeing a number of Republican French officers, (pri&s;oners) walking on the parade attended by their <HI>&s;ervants.</HI> Two of the&s;e latter, were receiving the orders of their ma&s;ters, with their heads uncovered, and their bodies bent in a very unrepublican manner. What! in a &s;tate of common calamity, are the&s;e nice di&s;tinctions to be made, thought I? are brother pri&s;oners to keep up this lofty difference? Are tho&s;e who have levelled the earth, &s;o &s;oon unmindful of their leading maxim? "All men are equal!" One of the &s;uperiors (I thought there were to be no &s;uperiors) grew angry, chid his dome&s;tic, and &s;ent him from his pre&s;ence. Could the old con&s;titution&mdash;could de&s;poti&s;m do more! I &s;aw the obedient &s;lave with the mo&s;t &s;ervile
<PB N="8" REF="19">&s;hrug of his country, and of his condition, go &s;linking away. So much for confraternity.</P>
<P>My friend, a &s;kilful u&s;e of words, &s;ub&s;ti|tuting one for another, as time and circum|&s;tance may require, will apparently change the nature of things: but real liberty and &s;lavery are the &s;ame beautiful and bitter potions, deno|minate them what you will, and the tyrant is not le&s;s an oppre&s;&s;or, for altering his name to that of a friend to freedom: indeed, &s;ome of the wor&s;t enemies that freedom ever had in all ages and countries, have a&s;&s;umed this &s;acred character.</P>
<P>Point out to me the De&s;pot, that has not called him&s;elf a lover of his people, and of his country. Under this &s;pecious ma&s;k I have, within a few years, been an eye-witne&s;s to no le&s;s than two formidable in&s;urrections in this little Republic, on the verge of which, I am now writing. I am far from being &s;ure, that I &s;hall not be &s;pectator of a

<HEAD>LETTER LVII. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>WE talk much, and with much rea&s;on, of the wild exce&s;&s;es of our Engli&s;h mobs, my dear friend. Their &s;anguinary di&s;po&s;ition has been compared to that of our Engli&s;h bull-dogs, which are &s;aid to be in|&s;atiate of blood, when they have once drawn it from the objects of their attack. Our Briti&s;h in&s;urrections are, no doubt, marked like others, by &s;ome of the prominent features of rebellion in all countries, deva&s;tation, flames, and un|timely death. But I did not know, how great an enemy man could be to man; nor had I a clear idea to what an extent human beings could go in the de&s;truction of one another,
<PB N="10" REF="21">although I am not unread in the bloody &s;tory of my own country, till I began to glean the more dreadful annals of others. The &s;ix years that have elap&s;ed &s;ince I beheld in Holland the demon of civil fury a&s;&s;ociated with party mad|ne&s;s, far from having abated the memory of their dire effects, are felt, methinks, with a &s;tronger horror, from having ob&s;erved &s;imilar outrages in other quarters of the agitated globe. Unhappy Holland! while one party were at|tempting to de&s;troy thee and them&s;elves by fire and &s;word, rapine and &s;laughter, the other were wreaking vengeance again&s;t thy be&s;t, faire&s;t, and mo&s;t innocent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions&mdash;upon thy wives and children.</P>
<P>While one &s;ide, I &s;ay, my friend, were thus outraging all order, decency, and compa&s;&s;ion, the other manife&s;ted no le&s;s fury. The party of the Stadtholder, and that of the patriots were alike infected with the poi&s;on of the times. It reached the bo&s;oms even of the gentler &s;ex: as an in&s;tance of which, pardon me, if I make your nature recoil, even as mine did on the day my flowing eyes bore te&s;timony to it. A party of patriots had taken, and killed, in the town of Bois-le-duc, one of the Princes adherents, who had been active in the cau&s;e of the Stadtholder. His defeat was,
<PB N="11" REF="22">therefore, a kind of triumph; a groupe of people &s;oon gathered round the body, yet &s;trug|gling betwixt life and death. Among&s;t the re&s;t, were two women who had been fetching water from the public fountains. One of the&s;e no &s;ooner under&s;tood the cau&s;e of the mob's collecting, than &s;he poured out about two thirds of the water from her pail, which &s;he placed under the wounds of the murdered citizen, who&s;e blood was thus mingled with the water, when pledging the &s;urrounding populace, &s;he exclaimed, as &s;he drank with more than &s;avage fury, "May rivers of this flow through the &s;treets till our enemies are vanqui&s;hed!" And to &s;uch a pitch of enthu&s;ia&s;m was this carried, that, as one more example, I mu&s;t inform you, another patriot quarrelled with the beautiful rainbow, and &s;hot at it, becau&s;e the orange mingled in its hues: this was nearly as mad and irreverent as the dre&s;&s;ing up the figure of the Virgin Mary with a red bonnet, and writing under the cro&s;s of our Saviour, the man Je&s;us, the <HI>ci-devant</HI> Redeemer of the world.</P>
<P>All comments of the morali&s;t, my friend, are lo&s;t, and all effu&s;ions of the peaceful lover of mankind ab&s;orbed on occa&s;ions like the&s;e: for breaches of this &s;ort in nations, like old and incurable wounds, though they are often
<PB N="12" REF="23">&s;kinned over, conceal an un&s;ubdued venom, which gathers &s;trength and virulence, and then again break out. Private families, we know, may, after "&s;ome imminent and deadly breach," reunite from policy, or principle, or from &s;ome reliques of affection: but even this is a patched up accommodation; and after a violent open rupture, whether in empires, or the little dome&s;tic common-wealths that form them, the whole hi&s;tory of mankind furni&s;h few examples where the parties have &s;incerely for|given one another. Many months after the Prince's party had been rein&s;tated in its privi|leges, and the patriot faction, not only yielded to authority, but appeared to have forgot its animo&s;ity, I had but too many illu&s;trations of the foregone remark. On the breaking out of the rebellion in other countries, I again heard the voice of &s;edition, and the more than <HI>murmurs</HI> of di&s;affection in various parts of the&s;e di&s;|united &s;tates. Sacred be the love of rational liberty. But the fever of freedom is a wild|fire that is more de&s;olating than any other con|tagion: that of Con&s;tantinople is not &s;o &s;ud|denly imbibed, nor does it travel with unim|paired venom &s;o far or &s;o fa&s;t. It is a pe&s;t that &s;eizes di&s;tant nations, and &s;trikes with the rapidity and the force of lightning. Even when Holland &s;eemed to have got the better of
<PB N="23" REF="24">this political plague, its poi&s;ons were under|mining her con&s;titution, and like tho&s;e fires which are burning in the bowels of the earth, un&s;een, are inwardly con&s;uming its entrails, and making their way to the &s;urface. I was in Holland when &s;he was preci&s;ely in this &s;itua|tion, prepared for her &s;econd &s;hock, and wait|ing only for the &s;ignal of her <HI>expatriated fire-brands</HI> (the bani&s;hed Dutch patriots then forming a part of the French army) to give the explo&s;ion. Breda was taken, Gorcum was inundated, and the cannonade of William&s;tadt, thundered to the very &s;ea, and prepared the patriots of the provinces for the reception of their exiled friends.</P>
<P>In my way to Helveot&s;luice, in order to em|bark for England, every countenance I looked into carried the marks of fear, loyalty, ambi|tion, or revolt. Notwith&s;tanding the cautious jealou&s;y natural to power, and all the vigilance of the magi&s;trates, little knots of people were to be ob&s;erved gathered together, in corners of the &s;treet, and in bye-places, where it was thought the eye of authority would not pene|trate. My wandering &s;teps, which &s;o often led me into unfrequented places, and thereby, as you have &s;een, make me tread upon many a &s;ecret, led me to the haunts of the&s;e Dutch
<PB N="14" REF="25">male-contents. They were always to be &s;een in that earne&s;t and ear-approaching whi&s;per, which &s;o often betrays its trea&s;ons; the fore|finger extended, the button caught at, and held fa&s;t, or &s;hook mo&s;t rebelliou&s;ly; the mouth of the &s;peaker contracted, &s;o as to &s;end forth only the unbetraying voice of con&s;piracy, and that of the hearer, on the contrary, opened to its width, to &s;wallow the trea&s;on, while the eyes of the party communicating, like a pair of &s;entinels, ordered to defend the door of the lips, &s;eemed to keep double watch, le&s;t, as Shak&s;peare &s;ays,
<Q><L>"The babbling go&s;&s;ips of the air</L>
<L>"Should prate of their <HI>where-about!</HI></L>"</Q>
Artizans, burgoma&s;ters, prie&s;ts, and pea&s;ants, were thus in&s;idiou&s;ly, or fearfully, gathered to|gether, either to expre&s;s their apprehen&s;ion, their hope, or their de&s;pair, were to be de|tected in the&s;e communities; and had not the whole country been threatened with a very &s;erious calamity, it would not have been un|amu&s;ing to a Gleaner, who delights
<Q>"To catch the living manners as they ri&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>It is not unentertaining to &s;ee the little &s;hifts which per&s;ons, engaged in &s;ecret conver&s;ations of any kind, make to prevent being di&s;cover|ed: the immediate change they make on the
<PB N="15" REF="26">fir&s;t view of an intruder&mdash;the &s;udden altera|tion from an aweful to a carele&s;s air as the &s;aid intruder approaches; the tones varied from almo&s;t in di&s;tinct whi&s;pers, and porten|tous meetings, to louder accents; now walking on, now &s;topping a little, as if engaged in ordinary conver&s;ation, the &s;ubject of which, while you have an eye on them, is changed as often as their po&s;itions. I took notice, while I pau&s;ed at Helveot&s;luice, that as their friends on the other &s;ide of the water, that is to &s;ay, the enemies of their country, were more rapid in their advances, while their very fires were in &s;ight, and the patriots, on the Helveot &s;ide, were almo&s;t opening their arms to receive them, the&s;e &s;ecret meetings were le&s;s vi&s;ible. It is a cri&s;is at which the <HI>mind</HI> of a con&s;piracy is made up, the component parts of which, perfectly under&s;tanding their plans, lie in wait to put them in execution, a&s;&s;uming, in the mean time, the ma&s;k of well-di&s;&s;embled loy|alty: for, &s;trange as it may &s;eem, vice, when &s;welled to its <HI>height,</HI> and ju&s;t about to &s;hew it|&s;elf, borrows the &s;emblance of its oppo&s;ite vir|tue, in the robes of which it is then mo&s;t a&s;&s;idu|ous to cover it&s;elf. Thus, drunkenne&s;s affects temperance, incontinence cha&s;tity, avarice ge|nero&s;ity, detraction candour, impiety religion, and faction, which would hurl a &s;overeign
<PB N="16" REF="27">from his throne, in that moment is the loude&s;t to &s;ing forth the prai&s;es of royalty.</P>
<P>But treachery, my dear friend, is never &s;o perilous, never &s;o fatal, as when it thus hides it&s;elf, and would &s;eem the thing it is not. From a foe, whom I ob&s;erve taking aim at me, I may e&s;cape by accident, by courage, or by addre&s;s, but from the &s;troke of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, whom, though I once knew him to be my ene|my, my believing heart at length con&s;iders as a penitent friend, I am &s;o far from being guarded, that to u&s;e the words of one of our old poets,
<Q>"I lay my &s;leeping life within his arms."</Q></P>
<P>Thus it was with the &s;everal inhabitants of Holland. They had done &s;peaking and were now prepared to act, and the moment of that action was waited for with the &s;ullen malig|nity and gloomy pa&s;time which characters a cold and determined nature, &s;uch as many of the natives of Holland po&s;&s;e&s;s. They waited for their long-wi&s;hed revenge in &s;ilence, but it was a &s;ilence that re&s;embled the fearful &s;tillne&s;s of the &s;ky, when the thunder is gathering force: but the &s;ilence of a Hollander, when once his part is taken, is more to be appre|hended than the thunder it&s;elf, of which I
<PB N="17" REF="28">gleaned an in&s;tance that is in re&s;erve for you. Perhaps I have rai&s;ed your curio&s;ity, and therefore you &s;hall have this dire example of Dutch revenge here.</P>
<P>Two brothers, on &s;ome very &s;light occa&s;ion, quarrelled, and, from being inmates, &s;eparated hou&s;es, neighbourhood, and at length broke connexion: their alienation was neither &s;oft|ened, nor embittered by corre&s;pondence. After about eleven years pa&s;t in this manner, one of the brothers married a beautiful woman. The &s;ingle brother, who had been watching his op|portunity of vengeance, made his appearance very unexpectedly on the wedding-day, and de&s;iring an interview with the married man in a &s;eparate apartment, was no &s;ooner perceived than welcomed; the latter taking it for granted he came to be reconciled, and had cho&s;en this di&s;tingui&s;hed day to render it more acceptable. The bachelor thus addre&s;&s;ed the bridegroom. <Q>Brother, we have not met &s;ince our di&s;agree|ment divided us, this day eleven years: I come now to remind you of the circum|&s;tance.&mdash;Thus,</Q>&mdash;&s;triking a poniard into the heart of the bridegroom, who had ju&s;t power to gain the apartment of his bride, who was then dancing with one of her hu&s;band's friends. Scarcely could he exclaim that he
<PB N="18" REF="29">was murdered, ere he &s;unk down and expired at her feet; and while the company and &s;er|vants were employed about their friend and ma&s;ter, the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in coolly mounted his hor&s;e, and made his e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Alas! my friend, it is with the patrioti&s;m that embraces all my fellow-creatures, and their happine&s;s, that I apprize you, that our pre&s;ent &s;heaf mu&s;t be deeply &s;potted with their blood! the mingled blood of beauty and deformity, innocence and guilt. The &s;cenery, which is yet in &s;tore, was partly painted amid&s;t the tranquillity of returning peace, and partly amid&s;t the horrors of returning war.</P>
<P>Often have I been within &s;ight, not &s;eldom within hearing, of two of the fierce&s;t oppo&s;i|tions that ever de&s;olated the works of man and God. You will not be &s;urpri&s;ed to learn, that the impre&s;&s;ion which &s;uch &s;cenes has made upon an eye and ear-witne&s;s, &s;hould have filled his mind with materials that lie fre&s;h in his memory, and bleed in his heart. How many towns, villages, and all that they inherit, have I &s;een blooming on the one day with beauty, wealth, content, and happy countenances, de|&s;poiled, deformed, impoveri&s;hed, and deluged in tears and in blood, upon another. The pictures of the&s;e, taken both in the one po&s;i|tion, and in the other, mu&s;t be given. They
<PB N="19" REF="30">&s;hall be delineated with &s;imple hi&s;torical truth, for neither romance nor fable, in their wilde&s;t, warme&s;t colourings, could, can, or has ever reached them.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;ibly the Gleaner is the fir&s;t traveller who hath yet de&s;cribed the happine&s;s of nations at peace, and the mi&s;ery of &s;uch nations at war, in a re&s;idence immediately <HI>before,</HI> and <HI>after,</HI> the violations of public tranquillity. He has viewed as well the havock of battle in its mo&s;t inten&s;e rage, as the cold horrors that &s;ucceeded conque&s;t. He has luxuriated in countries, when the horn of plenty filled them with fertility and fragrance, and deplored, even as if his property were mingled in the common wreck, the withering effects of victory, after the enemy had torn up all the works of nature, and of man, the mo&s;t fair, and the mo&s;t cheri&s;hed. He has been among&s;t the la&s;t to quit, and the fir&s;t to revi&s;it, a threatened country and evacuated town, and has ob&s;erved the labours of a life! a century! annihilated in a &s;ingle day! the de&s;olations of every work of art, and the more affecting ruins of human beings! Before he &s;et out on this la&s;t tour, of which he has here drawn the faint outline, he had &s;een public mi&s;ery, and felt its effects: his reading had furni&s;hed him
<PB N="20" REF="31">with recorded horrors in the bloody hi&s;tory of his own country: but all this was but the <HI>&s;hadow</HI> of the di&s;a&s;ter, which the excur&s;ion alluded to, has brought clo&s;er under his eye, and yet clo&s;er to his heart.</P>
<P>De&s;cending by degrees, in a &s;tep that re|ceded in proportion as the enemy advanced, I found my&s;elf almo&s;t imperceptibly once more in Holland, who&s;e armies, &s;till freezing upon the banks of the Mai&s;e and Lower Rhine, mu&s;t, perhaps, again have recour&s;e to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her great <HI>water-dog,</HI> to whom &s;he has more than once owed the &s;alvation of her Republic; and indeed this &s;turdy guardian ought to do infinite good, &s;ince he cannot be let loo&s;e upon the enemies of the &s;tate without abundant mi&s;chief&mdash;an inundation of the country being, next to captivity and its con&s;equences, the greate&s;t evil. Would you believe, after all which has happened &s;ince my former glean|ing of the United States, after all the faithful traditions of horror, blood&s;hed, pillage, and bla&s;phemy, which have been placed before them, that I find again here the &s;elf &s;ame &s;pirit of di&s;affection grown more gigantic, and with increa&s;e of ferocity proportioned to augmen|tation of force? For the di&s;affection of more <HI>arbitrary</HI> States, of France her&s;elf, for in&s;tance,
<PB N="21" REF="32">I can more ea&s;ily allow and account, but one would have thought that a Republic,&mdash;attached as is that of Holland to all tho&s;e things which the French people now mo&s;t hold in &s;corn, per&s;on, property, life, and religion; and with the bleeding te&s;timonies of rapine, deva&s;ta|tion and death before their eyes,&mdash;one would have thought, I &s;ay, that in &s;uch a country, among&s;t &s;uch a people, who have much to lo&s;e and nothing to gain, the fury of party, by which they have &s;o often unmercifully &s;uffered, and are &s;uffering at this moment in every limb and artery of the Republic, might have been moderated, if not de&s;troyed. Surely the de&s;pe|ration of liberty, like that of love, baffles all rea&s;oning, and mocks at all &s;ober laws. Even the riche&s;t merchants of the United Provinces, men who mu&s;t, on the very principles of equality, at lea&s;t, divide the labours and gains of life, with tho&s;e who &s;ub&s;i&s;t only by an oppo&s;ite &s;et of principles, which levels idlene&s;s and indu&s;try&mdash;even &s;uch men pant for the complete triumph of the common enemy, and are ready to &s;acrifice, not only their fortunes, but their families&mdash;to what? to fal&s;e ideas of freedom, and to revenge. What could they acquire? the gratification of an ancient grudge. What mu&s;t they lo&s;e? Every thing el&s;e. But &s;o cold and &s;o dark is their feeling on this &s;ub|ject, <PB N="22" REF="33">they would con&s;ider it as a cheap
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The purcha&s;e has been made; we &s;hall &s;ee how long they continue plea&s;ed with their bargain.</NOTE> pur|cha&s;e.</P>
<P>But the &s;preading flame is not confined to Holland! The Gleaner has traced its progre&s;s through the provincial, petty towns of Au&s;tria, where a &s;lender pa&s;&s;age of the Rhine &s;eparates the inhabitants from their utterly ruined neigh|bours, friends, and countrymen on the other &s;ide; he has &s;een and heard the look and tone of determined Revolution: and, if he has at one moment ob&s;erved one man retreating with fear, he has, in the next, noticed more than one remaining fixed to his hou&s;ehold, in hope of the de&s;troyer. In numberle&s;s places, be|lieve me, a <HI>protecting</HI> army is an object of &s;ilent, yet obvious, hate, and one which menaces cap|tivity is welcome. Along the banks of the Mai&s;e, as of the Rhine, even though their waves may be almo&s;t &s;aid, from the alchemy of commerce, to flow with <HI>gold,</HI> the very wor&s;hip|pers of that precious mi&s;chief would gladly tinge its billows with blood! In We&s;tphalia, in Pru&s;&s;ia, he has followed, in every direction, the like power. You cannot get into a public-hou&s;e, boat, or carriage, but the water and the
<PB N="13" REF="34">land re-echoes with the ill-di&s;&s;embled voice or loyalty, or the avowed and bolder tones of faction.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the fever is more univer&s;al than any other that has yet raged in the world. It &s;eizes on all ages, &s;exes, and countries; and though millions have already died of it, the fury rather increa&s;es than abates. I have &s;een old fellows in their grand climacteric (to whom an ea&s;y chair and a warm peaceful hearth, one would think, might compri&s;e all the liberty &s;ighed for), I have &s;een &s;uch receive with ex|ultation every account of a fortre&s;s de&s;troyed, a village burned, or a city de&s;olated, even though adjoining their own. Like the malig|nant Zanga, but un&s;upported by Zanga's motives of revenge; they
<Q><L>"Love the rocking of the battlements;</L>
<L>"It &s;uits the gloomy habit of their &s;ouls."</L></Q> In a word, in a circuit of many hundred leagues, I have &s;een a &s;pirit of revolt to the ruling power, (whether emperor, &s;tadtholder, or king) that ri&s;es among&s;t the ruins, and &s;tirs up in&s;urrection amid&s;t the very a&s;hes of thrones and dominions!

<P><PB N="25" REF="36">But, however, my countrymen, and my friends, are to be felicitated on this circum|&s;tance, I &s;orrow to di&s;tre&s;s them by delineating the &s;ad rever&s;e, and, therefore, will
<Q>"Spare the telling, &s;ince it be a pain,"</Q> as long as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The hurry and agitation of public affairs have led me to &s;ome anticipations; the croud|ing incidents of the moment; the now gather|ing, now di&s;per&s;ing &s;torms of war, have made me break in upon my re&s;erves prematurely; and <HI>that</HI> to the neglect of many a more pacific and &s;miling &s;cene. To the&s;e I &s;hall return with a &s;atisfaction that, I flatter my&s;elf, you will &s;hare, as it will, for a while, &s;u&s;pend every more turbulent &s;ubject, and empower me to conduct you gradually along, till you almo&s;t forget we are approach|ing &s;cenes of deva&s;tation. By &s;uch means, too, I &s;hall rather break the blow upon your feelings than take them by &s;urprize: nay, more, as our paths to the &s;eats of war lie through &s;ome of the mo&s;t charming parts of We&s;tphalian Pru&s;&s;ia, I &s;hall even &s;trew tho&s;e paths with flowers.</P>
<P>I am now again addre&s;&s;ing you from Nime|guen, the la&s;t con&s;iderable town of the Dutch
<PB N="26" REF="37">territory, where, after having employed the re&s;t of this letter, in a few Gleanings properly belonging to Holland, and the Provinces, we will journey onward,
<Q>"Sedate to think, and watching each event."</Q> and, with our accu&s;tomed privileges,
<Q>"Try what the open, what the covert yields."</Q></P>
<P>You have in recollection, I tru&s;t, my Glean|ings of the Dutch theatre, when the gho&s;t of Hamlet &s;talked upon the &s;tage of Holland, during the Hague fair. On a re-vi&s;itation of that celebrated town &s;ome days ago, I found that a troop of German actors had been per|mitted to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the playhou&s;e, &s;ituated in the Ca&s;u&agrave;ry-&s;treet, which the French comedians (convicted of Jacobini&s;m, as I in|formed you), had evacuated. The fir&s;t piece, at the repre&s;entation of which I attended, was called, I think, The Robber; in which, among&s;t &s;everal very fine-wrought, and as fine acted, &s;cenes, was <HI>one</HI> turning upon an event &s;o prepo&s;terous, that I mu&s;t relate it to you. The hero of the performance is a young man, who, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, robs his own father, and, eloping from his paternal hou&s;e, carries his plunder to a de&s;perate banditti, who have their haunts in a deep fore&s;t, and with &s;uch a&s;&s;ociates he &s;hares the plunder and the crimes. Notwith|&s;tanding <PB N="27" REF="38">his companions have had &s;trength enough over the virtues of his youth to extin|gui&s;h his &s;en&s;e of duty to an aged and almo&s;t helple&s;s parent (and one of the tendere&s;t that ever bore the name), and even to make him forego the endearing &s;ociety of a lady to whom he was powerfully attached, they had not force of &s;eduction &s;ufficient to eradicate, entirely, the vital principle of nature and con&s;cience, which, at various periods, broke forth in &s;ighs of re|mor&s;e, and blu&s;hes of &s;hame. The "cunning of the &s;cene" affords many di&s;plays of the&s;e, and in the lucid returns of his heavily-&s;mitten heart, he re&s;cues that very parent, and that very much-loved, though de&s;erted, mi&s;tre&s;s, from the barbarity and machinations of an elder brother: This brother is, al&s;o, by his means, (and by the mo&s;t equitable laws of human life, as well as of the drama) brought to ju&s;t puni&s;hment; and, by arrangements no le&s;s proper, the father is re&s;tored to the freedom and honours which his elde&s;t &s;on had ravi&s;hed from him, and the young lady is pre&s;erved from violation. By &s;uch means, the parties, long divided by the vices, are brought together by the virtues of this heroic robber. Forgive|ne&s;s of the father, and of the mi&s;tre&s;s, are matters of cour&s;e, and the reconciliatory &s;cenes, which exhibit the&s;e, are as naturally &s;u&s;tained
<PB N="28" REF="39">as the incidents by which they are brought about, are artfully contrived. Every thing is in the faire&s;t way of being &s;ettled to the &s;atisfaction of the characters and of the au|dience. I never witne&s;&s;ed the <HI>denouement</HI> of a tragedy more comfortably arranged for the feelings. But the author was of a different opinion, for in the moment that you are about to congratulate this good ending of as bad a beginning, the poet &s;tarts a difficulty, which I conceive neither nature or rea&s;on &s;ugge&s;ted to him. The almo&s;t converted robber, even while &s;upported on the one hand by the love of a father, and on the other, by that of an adored mi&s;tre&s;s, finds out, that having <HI>&s;worn</HI> to live and die with his fore&s;t companions, he cannot violate his oath; and that, even if he could, his delicacy would not &s;uffer him to carry pollution into the arms of an innocent woman.</P>
<P>Now, if you approve of this <HI>&s;troke of delicacy,</HI> I could wi&s;h to &s;top at it; but, as a faithful Gleaner, I mu&s;t proceed to inform you, that our delicate hero by no means contents him&s;elf with this declaration; but while his hand is joined by a parent to that of a mi&s;tre&s;s, who covers it with tears of joy, and ki&s;&s;es of love, he literally
<Q>"Threws it like a noi&s;ome weed away."</Q>
<PB N="29" REF="40">ob&s;erving that, although he feels it impo&s;&s;ible to marry the lady him&s;elf, he cannot endure the thought of her living for another. This new misfortune &s;inks the father to the ground, upon which he is left to die on one &s;ide of the &s;tage, while the lady &s;tands &s;tatue-&s;truck with grief on the other. Neither of the&s;e objects go to the heart of our hero. On the contrary, he intimates that there is no way left to pacify his fears on this curious point of delicacy, but the death of this beloved mi&s;tre&s;s. Hereupon the poet makes her obligingly take the hint by throwing her&s;elf into an attitude to receive the blow from the hand of her lover; who, how|ever, rather he&s;itates about it, upon which the lady pre&s;ents her beautiful bo&s;om (all heroines you know <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be beautiful) to any of the robbers; none of whom can be found to
<Q><L>"Scar that whiter &s;kin of her's</L>
<L>"Than monumental alaba&s;ter."</L></Q> when men, who live by pillage and murder, are thus tender-hearted, I am ju&s;tified in apply|ing the quotation; though, I &s;hould con&s;ider my&s;elf as having a &s;ufficient &s;anction on the <HI>determined</HI> laws of the drama, to enrol among&s;t their unities, tho&s;e of heroi&s;m and per&s;onal beauty.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="41">The Ruffians, however, all un&s;heath their &s;words, and might, perhaps, have been wrought upon to cut in twain the &s;ilken bonds of humanity, that held them a moment uplifted, had not the hero come forth in all the <HI>might</HI> of his delicacy, in the &s;hape of <HI>a rant,</HI> (loud and vehement as ever pierc'd "the ears of the groundlings)," to a&s;&s;ert <HI>his</HI> &s;ole and exclu&s;ive claim to the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. Saying which, and a great deal more, he takes the woman of his heart, <HI>gently</HI> in his arms, then buries his dagger <HI>gently</HI> in her brea&s;t, then &s;upports her <HI>gently</HI> as &s;he &s;inks on the earth, where, <HI>gently</HI> placing her on the &s;ide oppo&s;ite that of his dead father, on who&s;e body by the bye, dying or dead, he never be&s;tows a glance, and then <HI>gently</HI> embracing his robber-friends, he &s;talks off to kill him&s;elf at a more convenient &s;ea&s;on: and thus concludes this <HI>gentle</HI> piece of bu&s;ine&s;s: of which if any thing <HI>could</HI> add to the ab&s;urdity, it would be the circum&s;tance of having ju&s;t before found him&s;elf wholly incapable of &s;tab|bing his worthle&s;s brother, becau&s;e, though &s;tained with the foule&s;t offences again&s;t his dear father and dearer mi&s;tre&s;s, he was, for&s;ooth, a good for nothing&mdash;brother! If this is not <HI>refining upon refinement,</HI> and <HI>out-&s;entimentizing &s;entimentality,</HI> the deuce is in it! Few of my readers but mu&s;t allow this was carrying the
<PB N="31" REF="42"><HI>point of delicacy</HI> a little too far: and, for my part, if this is the German method of &s;ettling the point, I remain a &s;teady admirer of the coar&s;e Engli&s;h fa&s;hion of &s;tabbing <HI>any body,</HI> and, in|deed, almo&s;t <HI>every</HI> body, rather than the woman of one's heart.</P>
<P>But the truth is, this is <HI>not</HI> the German mode any more than it is ours, as I have &s;hewn, and &s;hall &s;till &s;hew, in various in&s;tances. It is the act and deed &s;olely of the <HI>author of this drama,</HI> who has therein not only put his heroine to death for his own amu&s;ement, but has com|mitted an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination upon a much greater character, even <HI>nature her&s;elf,</HI> and this is one example (out of an hundred) that has made me wi&s;h, gentlemen, who have the life and death of their characters, as dramatick writers, in their hands, would be a little le&s;s lavi&s;h of human, at lea&s;t of poetical blood, without &s;hewing cau&s;e in the courts of <HI>rea&s;on, nature,</HI> and <HI>con&s;cience.</HI> Not that I mean to attach this &s;train upon dramatic or natural laws, to the productions of the German poets in general. They very frequently write, and act, with the mo&s;t accurate knowledge of the human heart, and &s;eldom fail to find their way to it, when their purpo&s;e is to intere&s;t its affections.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="43">I was, indeed, &s;oon recompen&s;ed for the above related outrage of probability, by the performance which I &s;aw at the &s;ame theatre, a few nights after, when all was
<Q>"Nature to advantage dre&s;s'd."</Q> It was, properly &s;peaking, a gala play, being repre&s;ented in honour of the Prince Stadtholder's birth-day, one of the few very occa&s;ional events which bring a &s;ufficient number of people to fill the Hague theatre; for, although it is not larger than Colman's in the Haymarket, there is rarely audience enough to pay for the few pounds of candle be&s;towed to illumine the gloom, and, doubtle&s;s, this is one rea&s;on why there is not more light thrown upon the audience of the Hague. On this great occa&s;ion, however, there were about <HI>half</HI> as many lamps &s;tuck over the Stadtholder's box as would have been placed on the board of his Britannick Maje&s;ty's corn-cutter on the 4th of June; and even the under tier of &s;conces, that u&s;ually &s;tand unoccupied, were filled with wax! In a word, I beheld the a&s;toni&s;hing circum&s;tance of a Dutch theatre <HI>crowded;</HI> and, in&s;tead of "<HI>the beggarly account of empty boxes,</HI> I found my&s;elf among&s;t the flower and fa&s;hion of the Hague.</P>
<P>After being waited for by the actors and the audience the decent time, that is, ju&s;t long
<PB N="33" REF="44">enough to wind up expectation to the proper pitch, without &s;training its &s;prings, his Serene Highne&s;s and his Royal-blooded partner made their appearance, the fir&s;t in a mode&s;t &s;uit of &s;lightly-ornamented blue broad cloth, the la&s;t according to the etiquette made and provided, in the&s;e ca&s;es, glittering in white &s;ilver ti&s;&s;ue. Brun&s;wick's elde&s;t hope was &s;hining at their &s;ide, and his Duche&s;s attended the graceful and lovely Prince&s;s Hereditary in the &s;tage-box, de|corated, for that night only, to receive them.</P>
<P>But, alas! all this was but the gay di&s;gui&s;e of a concealed anxiety; or rather, it was but the trapping and incumbrance of a comfortle&s;s &s;ituation, too mighty for di&s;gui&s;es. Three days and nights previous to this theatrical exhi|bition of them&s;elves, had the Prince, Prince&s;s, and train been made the illu&s;trious victims of this anniver&s;ary martyrdom: and every mo|ment that was not devoted to the bendings, bowings, and other pliabilities of the court, was &s;eized upon by the camp, for it was the time when above a thou&s;and &s;oldiers were pre|paring to replace the deva&s;tations of the la&s;t campaign in Flanders. The Stadtholder is indefatigable in his military duties; and the&s;e, happening to fall at the period when he was to receive the compliments of the nobility and
<PB N="34" REF="45">gentry, on gaining the forty-&s;ixth year of his age, you will not wonder to hear that he brought to the play-hou&s;e a weary head, and, perhaps, an aching heart; the more e&s;pecially as it was &s;aid an heavy piece of public news had been received from the frontiers, which it was nece&s;&s;ary to hu&s;h up in his own mind, and in that of his augu&s;t partner in di&s;tre&s;s, le&s;t it &s;hould check the ardour of the troops about to take their departure. There is, you know, a cri&s;is in &s;plendid, as well as other mi&s;ery, at which the oppre&s;&s;ed &s;pirits and faculties take refuge in &s;leep. It appeared to be exactly this cri&s;is, when the party above-mentioned gained the theatre; for &s;carce had the natal &s;alutations been received and acknowledged, than a deep &s;leep fell upon both their Highne&s;&s;es, and upon the Prince of Brun&s;wick. Never did I &s;ee three illu&s;trious per&s;onages &s;o oddly di&s;po&s;ed of. They &s;unk &s;ubdued into a comfortable nap, as if it had been a preconcerted thing to refre&s;h them|&s;elves at the theatre with a doze of this &s;ort; and which, to &s;ay the truth, they &s;tood &s;adly in need of. It &s;eems they had been exhau&s;ting them&s;elves in public affairs and ceremonies, from five in the morning to midnight of the preceding day. But that the anodyne was very powerful, may be gathered from their enjoying it, almo&s;t unbroken, through the three long acts
<PB N="35" REF="46">of a German opera, &s;pun to the length of as many German miles. Once, indeed, his <HI>Serene</HI> Highne&s;s opened half an eye, and ca&s;t it, in a dizzy way, fir&s;t at the &s;leeping prince&s;s, then at the &s;noring duke, as if to explore the cau&s;e that rou&s;ed him; but, perceiving it was only the cra&s;h of in&s;truments, in a general chorus by way of <HI>finale</HI> to the &s;econd act, he again bid adieu to unwelcome recollections, in the oblivious arms of that power which is very ju&s;tly called the kind "re&s;torer of nature." I could not help a reflection on the different allot|ments of human kind, as I &s;aw the mo&s;t illu&s;|trious of the audience the only parts of it which were unable to enjoy either the harmony, or the plea&s;antry of the entertainment, and alto|gether in&s;en&s;ible to the &s;urrounding &s;plendours. We rave about, and we are bleeding at every pore, and fermenting in every vein, for <HI>Equality,</HI> my dear friend; we are hearing perpetually of the nece&s;&s;ity of bringing the poor on a level with the rich, nobles with pea&s;ants, and kings with beggars&mdash;ah, God of them all, with how little rea&s;on! with how little recollection of the hi&s;tory of <HI>human conditions!</HI> The wor&s;t and the mo&s;t unhappy is probably that which winds up the climax! and &s;o on of the &s;eries: &s;ince it is mo&s;t likely the hou&s;ele&s;s beggar, who eats his mor&s;el of alms under a hedge of thorns, when
<PB N="36" REF="47">the rude hand of winter had torn off every &s;hel|tering leaf, in remembrance of the day that brought into the world the brat which he buckles to his back, has a more exqui&s;ite reli&s;h of that mor&s;el, and is more &s;oothed by the gra|tulations of his weather-beaten companions, than the Prince and Prince&s;s of the Republic of Holland, &s;leeping amid&s;t the felicitations of a theatre, or, in truth, any prince, or prince&s;s in the&s;e times. Equality! alas, were all men reduced to a level <HI>like this,</HI> how &s;oon would tho&s;e who, till then perhaps, without being con|&s;cious of it, had experienced the ble&s;&s;ings of an humble &s;tate, wi&s;h again for the refuge and di&s;tinction of poverty. Who&s;oever has looked on the fatigues, weight, and peril of the ele|vations among&s;t mankind, mu&s;t know this, and it is &s;trange there &s;hould be found any one &s;o unrea&s;onable as to envy the exalted this gild|ing of their care and mi&s;ery. As to the emi|nent examples in que&s;tion, happy to &s;ee them enjoy this temporary re&s;pite, I was &s;orry when the fall of the curtain awakened and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them to new fatigues.</P>
<P>Whatever might be their fate for the re&s;t of that night, to new fatigues the Stadtholder, at lea&s;t, was de&s;tined the &s;ucceeding morning. The troops which had co&s;t him &s;o much trouble
<PB N="37" REF="48">to make ready, were to march at eight o'clock. Without u&s;ing literary privileges, which allow authors to blot out the &s;un, or command him to &s;end forth his mo&s;t effulgent beam (having, you know, a charter from Parna&s;&s;us to do as we plea&s;e with the elements) I a&s;&s;ure you, in the pro&s;e &s;implicity of truth, that, <HI>really</HI>
<Q><L>"The dawn <HI>was</HI> overca&s;t, the morning low'r'd,</L>
<L>"And heavily in clouds brought on the day."</L></Q> Nay more, tho&s;e clouds, very &s;oon after the Stadtholder reached the parade, broke on his un&s;heltered head, for the indi&s;pen&s;ible cere|monies of a field-day were to be exchanged, and his Royal Highne&s;s (princes not counting among&s;t their prerogatives the liberty of con|trolling the &s;kies to their purpo&s;e) got a duck|ing more &s;evere than that I have recorded in a former letter. One would again be led to think that "there was more in the&s;e matters than philo&s;ophy can find out:" for really had the clouds been in combination again&s;t him, they could not have &s;pouted down a more inau&s;pi|cious torrent. It was not, however, of &s;uffi|cient vehemence to damp his martial attention: neither had it the force to chill public curio|&s;ity: con&s;equently it was &s;et at defiance by powers &s;tronger than either curio&s;ity, or martial ardour. Never, on any public occa&s;ion, did
<PB N="38" REF="49">I &s;ee &s;uch a collection of human beings. Every pa&s;&s;ion of the heart, and every feeling of nature, were here met together. In the form either of patriots, princes, men, wives, mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, children, officers, or &s;oldiers, you might have ob&s;erved hate, allegiance, love, hope, and de&s;pair. You might have remarked al&s;o a few &s;miles of heroi&s;m, amid&s;t many bitter tears of apprehen&s;ion. The di&s;a&s;ters of the la&s;t cam|paign were had in <HI>bleeding</HI> remembrance, and there were tho&s;e among&s;t the di&s;affected inha|bitants, who exclaimed, <Q>See what a brave &s;hew of fellows are waiting <HI>orders to march to the &s;hambles!</HI></Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alas! this exclamation has &s;ince proved, in &s;ome late in|&s;tance, &s;o late as the 15th and 16th of April la&s;t, but too pro|phetic; and, although the military entr&eacute; of the young Imperial Monarch has been marked with glory, one cannot but regret it has been marked with &s;o much of the blood of his allies. Many of the very men whom the Gleaner beheld that day leaving their country have bade it an eternal adieu. It is the fate of war: but one &s;hrinks from the thought; and I wi&s;h I had not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">een them all alive. It is weakne&s;s, perhaps, but forgive me.</NOTE></P>
<P>In&s;idious whi&s;perings of this kind had been in circulation for &s;ome time, and &s;everal de|&s;ertions had taken place in con&s;equence; up|wards of twenty on the night immediately pre|ceding their march. Nor was this the wor&s;t: a di&s;piriting kind of alarm pervaded the &s;oldiery,
<PB N="39" REF="50">who performed their military preparations with reluctant delay. I had noticed many of them &s;tanding, the day before their departure, by the &s;ide of their baggage waggons, as if they were taking a &s;urvey of their hear&s;es, filling them with their beds, &amp;c. as if they pre&s;aged they would prove their beds of death. Others were following the&s;e vehicles with all their marching apparatus, not with eyes that anti|cipated victory, but with downca&s;t looks, and &s;olemn &s;teps, to dirge-like mea&s;ure, as if they were moving after the coffin of a comrade; and the beat of the drum that acts &s;o wonderfully upon the &s;pirits in certain moments, now &s;eemed to &s;ound in their ears the dead march.</P>
<P>Examples of every kind are known to be contagious; in no in&s;tance, perhaps, more than in their influence upon our hopes and fears: courage and cowardice are communi|cated in a moment: they are even <HI>transferred</HI> with electric rapidity from one man to another; the bo&s;om of the brave, catching an unwonted apprehen&s;ion, and the brea&s;t of the da&s;tard, glowing with even an unnatural ardour, as the poi&s;onous breath of di&s;affection, or the ex|hilarating powers of loyalty, are diffu&s;ed among&s;t them. It is a lamentable thing when private hou&s;es or public empires are &s;et again&s;t them|&s;elves. <PB N="40" REF="51">States are only large families, united by the &s;ame laws, and bound by the &s;ame in|tere&s;t. The connexions of the neare&s;t ties in private life are &s;carce more clo&s;e, nor ought they to be more &s;acred. As the welfare of man and wife, &s;o the pro&s;perity of nations, my friend,

<P>On this important morning, however, the Stadtholder rallied the half-&s;educed energies of his &s;oldiers; he &s;aluted them fir&s;t generally, then particularly; he complimented, and with great ju&s;tice, their martial appearance, cheered
<PB N="41" REF="52">them with a prince's &s;mile, di&s;tributed among&s;t them a prince's bounty, be&s;towed, with well|timed addre&s;s, a prince's eulogy on their known valour, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<Q>"A little flattery &s;ometimes does well."</Q>
<P>He manife&s;ted, by fifty little attentions, that he con&s;idered them as the faithful defenders of the Republic, and, in &s;hort, put in motion every wheel of a good general, a good-natured prince, and a good man. His deportment had a vi&s;ible effect on the troops, into who&s;e countenances there came, as if by reflection, a &s;udden and promi&s;ing brightne&s;s: the morning it&s;elf began to look more cheerfully, and the officers with their men duly equipped, from the orange branches in their hats, to the neat knap&s;ack at their backs, took their march through the &s;treets leading to Schedam&mdash;their fir&s;t day's march&mdash;accompanied to the outer gate of the town by tens of thou&s;ands of &s;pectators.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LIX. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE in a former gleaning noted the wonderful progre&s;&s;ive relief from low to high land, and from wet to dry, from &s;tagnant canals to running &s;treams, as you proceed in your journey from the United Provinces to the Upper Countries. This is le&s;s &s;en&s;ibly felt after a few days or weeks ramble in Guelder|land; but could the traveller be &s;uddenly tran&s;|ported from the Province of what is properly called Holland, to tho&s;e blooming edges of We&s;t|phalia, to which I am now conducting you, he would imagine, that <HI>one</HI> was the purgatory of &s;inful, and the <HI>other</HI> the paradi&s;e of happy &s;ouls: The fabled waters of the Styx and of Ely&s;ium, are not more &s;trongly contra&s;ted. The very air, as well as the water, takes a purer breath. Not that in point of vegetable or rural gran|deur, We&s;tphalian Pru&s;&s;ia is to be compared to &s;everal parts of Dutch Guelderland; but in point of unambitious and ever-&s;miling &s;cenery, I have never &s;een any thing &s;uperior. The hou&s;es and the land, and, indeed, the inhabi|tants of Holland, re&s;emble nothing but them|&s;elves. <PB N="45" REF="56">The charming Duchy of Cleves, and "all that it inherits," re&s;embles the mo&s;t beautiful una&s;&s;uming parts of England. You have &s;carce reached the fir&s;t Pru&s;&s;ian town, which is mid|way betwixt Nimeguen and Cleves, the name of which is Cuylenberg, ere your native country pre&s;&s;es on your heart: you &s;eem to be carried, by &s;ome magician into the mid&s;t of its alluring &s;cenery; its whited cottages, comfortable farms, and cultured grounds, are all within your view. You are &s;truck at almo&s;t every &s;tep with the &s;imilitude. It is the agreeable and beautiful, but not the &s;ublime of nature. There is nothing of hill or vale, water or wood, to a&s;to|ni&s;h the traveller; but there are numbers of objects always fre&s;h and always charming, and a pro&s;pect of great abundance. I am &s;peak|ing here of the Duchy of Cleves in a circum|ference of its be&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, a <HI>coup d'oeil</HI> of more than fifty miles; for, on a clear day, your eye can travel to this extent, if it takes &s;ight from any of the delightful little emi|nences near the town of Cleves: particularly from a mount in the wood which gives you the command of half a dozen noble avenues, each a mile in length, at the end of which your view is bounded by the prettie&s;t towns in the Circle of We&s;tphalia, and Province of Guel|derland. The eye re&s;ts &s;atisfied and refre&s;hed;
<PB N="46" REF="57">it wi&s;hes not to penetrate beyond the&s;e beau|tiful limits. The Cleves wood is, in it&s;elf, full of charms, artificial and natural; but by the former I only mean the &s;tately, and &s;ome|what formal, rows of trees, which &s;hade and canopy the almo&s;t numberle&s;s paths that are cut through it. Yet, admitting this to be an objection to the lover of nature in all her graceful wildne&s;s, there are to be found in this wood an infinity of bye-walks, where nature is permitted to enjoy her utmo&s;t romance, and to &s;port her "virgin fancies," and which, perhaps, derive additional charms from the contra&s;t with the more <HI>di&s;ciplined</HI> vegetation. This fine wood is fenced round with the old Engli&s;h-looking park-paling, thatched, as it were, with grey mo&s;s, as with us, and, as with us, the chaffinch, green|finch, goldfinch, and "all the other finches of the grove," as the Critic &s;ays, are &s;een peck|ing at it on a fine &s;pring morning to build the outworks of their ne&s;ts. I have haunted this wood at all times and &s;ea&s;ons, and tru&s;t, there|fore, you will be plea&s;ed with both a &s;ummer, and winter account of it. There appears to be &s;omething remarkable in the foliage of We&s;tphalia, to be ob&s;erved in the mo&s;t dreary months. With us, even in our mo&s;t extended fore&s;ts, the trees and bu&s;hes are almo&s;t &s;tripped of their withered foliage. In Great-Britain
<PB N="47" REF="58">and in Holland, autumn &s;carce leaves a trace behind her when the "&s;urly winter," as our poet of nature beautifully calls him "with his ruffian train," has u&s;urped her empire. It is far otherwi&s;e in We&s;tphalia: The underwood, not only of the enduring oaks, but of all other &s;orts of more tender &s;hrub wood, &s;carcely &s;u&s;tain the lo&s;s of a leaf; a general ru&s;&s;et, &s;uch as we &s;ee in the Engli&s;h groves, when they put on their November robes, covers whole acres till the end of March, when it is mo&s;t likely nature is arrayed in her &s;pring dre&s;s in Great Britain. Re&s;pecting the trees of fore&s;t growth, they are here, as in the general roads of France, and in the avenues that lead to our antique man&s;ions of England, planted in the &s;traight line, but their regularity as to height and extent gives them one appearance, at the pre&s;ent moment, &s;ingular and agreeable. Three or four days of rain, with the intervals of a dry &s;outhern air, have given them &s;uch an univer&s;al blu&s;h, that (though nothing like a leaf is to be &s;een in alleys of &s;everal thou&s;and trees, cut into different roads at right angles, and is &s;imply the effect of a &s;well among&s;t the buds) you have the promi&s;e, that the very next &s;unny day will <HI>invert</HI> Shak&s;peare's much-critici&s;ed expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>making the green</HI> ONE <HI>red,</HI> by making the <HI>red</HI> ONE <HI>green;</HI> for on cropping one of the&s;e bloom|ing <PB N="45" REF="59">twigs, and pre&s;&s;ing the buds with your finger, you perceive them bur&s;ting into infant vegetation.</P>
<P>Eight and forty hours of genial weather &s;o changes the&s;e glowing branches, that the eye regales in a pro&s;pect of that tender verdure, which, in vegetable, as in human, life, gives the fre&s;hne&s;s and complexional delicacy which belongs only to the mo&s;t <HI>early youth of nature;</HI> &s;o &s;weet to behold, and, alas! &s;o &s;oon de&s;troyed: Neither the broad foliage of a more advanced Spring, nor the rich expan&s;ion and colouring of confirmed Summer, offer any thing &s;o pure. There are, you know, the &s;ame changes, pro|ductive of the &s;ame effects, in the progre&s;s of life, in the &s;everal &s;tages of <HI>its</HI> Spring, Summer, and Autumn.</P>
<P>Suffer me now to carry you about Cleves Land. Imagine that you are &s;eated on one of the ru&s;tic benches, in a retired part of its deli|cious wood, while I recount to you the glean|ings of &s;everal tours in its neighbourhood.</P>
<P>The town of Cleves in it&s;elf has nothing to recommend it, but the exce&s;&s;ive beauty of its &s;ituation. It is a large, &s;traggling, ill-paved place, with many good hou&s;es and more bad.
<PB N="49" REF="60">It is, however, the capital of the Duchy, and under the domination of his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty. Though &s;o near to Holland, and with &s;uch an example of neatne&s;s before their eyes, the inha|bitants of Cleves by no means deign to follow it. On the contrary, they are in their hou&s;es, &s;treets, and not unfrequently in their per&s;ons, the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting contra&s;ts:&mdash;but of the&s;e di&s;agreeable matters hereafter.</P>
<P>As I reached the environs of the town, the fir&s;t day my affections were very &s;ingularly intere&s;ted: Indeed, I know not when they have been more powerfully called forth, where the objects of their &s;ympathy were taken not from the human &s;pecies, but from the animal world. About a mile from the We&s;tern-gate, I per|ceived a man and boy bu&s;ied in doing &s;omething to the mo&s;t beautiful ox I ever beheld: as I came nearer I found they were adorning it with a great variety of fanciful ornaments'; a large collar of yew branches, tied with ribbon, and wreathed with other evergreens, were thrown over its neck: painted papers, on which were drawn herds, flocks, and &s;hepherds, and folded into large beau knots, were fixed, I am afraid, <HI>pinned</HI> with large corkers to its &s;kin, in various parts of the body: bunches of the &s;ame were tied to the tail, braided into the mane,
<PB N="50" REF="61">and the brows were hung with a garland of holly, of which there was a twi&s;t fa&s;tened by red filleting even to the horns, on the tips of which were &s;tuck little May-bu&s;hes in bloom.</P>
<P>My attention was pre&s;ently called off from this, by the bleat of a &s;heep and its lamb: tho&s;e creatures were bound to an hedge in a corner of the &s;ame enclo&s;ure. They were dre&s;&s;ed nearly in the ta&s;te of the ox, with this variation in the lamb, a collar of &s;everal early &s;pring flowers of the field, and &s;ome twigs of hawthorn, in bud, and which, betwixt &s;port and earne&s;t, it was trying to get into its mouth. On a&s;king the cau&s;e of all this finery, I was told it was upon account of its being a <HI>jour-de-f&ecirc;te,</HI> and al&s;o the day before that of the greate&s;t beef, mutton, and lamb market, in the whole year!</P>
<P>And pray, friend, &s;aid I, where is the nece&s;|&s;ity of dre&s;&s;ing the animals in that manner?</P>
<P>'Tis our cu&s;tom, Sir, replies the man driv|ing the ox towards the town, and the boy with the &s;heep and lamb, now unbound, following his example.</P>
<P>I had not time for more interrogatories, being wholly taken up with the anticks of the
<PB N="51" REF="62">lamb, which frolicking &s;ometimes with its mother, and &s;ometimes with the boy, and &s;ome|times even with its own &s;hadow, brought &s;o clo&s;e, under my eye, and &s;o near indeed to my very heart, the fine lines of Mr. Pope, that I repeated them over and over. Every image of his de&s;cription had its immediate illu&s;tration in the objects before me:
<Q><L>"The lamb, thy riot dooms to bleed to day,</L>
<L>"Had he thy rea&s;on, would he &s;kip and play?</L>
<L>"Pleas'd to the la&s;t, he crops the flow'ry food,</L>
<L>"And licks the hand ju&s;t rais'd to &s;hed his blood!</L></Q></P>
<P>We gained Cleves as I pronounced, for the tenth time, that impre&s;&s;ive ver&s;e which gives the moral of the former &s;tanza&mdash;
<Q>"O blindne&s;s to the future! <HI>kindly</HI> given."</Q></P>
<P>The animals were led, or rather driven, through the principal &s;treets, literally for a <HI>&s;hew,</HI> it being the practice of We&s;tphalia for the butchers to exhibit their meat <HI>alive</HI> the day preceding the &s;laughter. I pretend to que&s;tion neither the u&s;e nor the nece&s;&s;ity of all this; nor by any means to &s;tretch pity or feeling be|yond their bound. I only ob&s;erve to you, that my affections followed the&s;e creatures in their <HI>funeral</HI> proce&s;&s;ion through the town of Cleves, and could not leave them till on turning a nar|row lane, I &s;aw, with a kind of emotion you
<PB N="52" REF="63">will ea&s;ily gue&s;s, the door of the place de&s;tined for their de&s;truction; it being a practice in this country to &s;laughter their meat, and a very filthy one it is,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;ame vi&s;e cu&s;tom prevails in &s;everal parts of Holland.</NOTE> in the open &s;treet; the pave|ments and kennels of which are &s;tained and running with blood.</P>
<P>I will carry you no farther into this little adventure than ju&s;t to note, that being the next day obliged to pa&s;s the end of the &s;treet, where I took leave of my poor dumb com|panions, I ob&s;erved not only &s;everal parts of them hang upon hooks at the butcher's &s;hop, but &s;everal of the ornaments. Even the flowers that were wreathed about the face of the lamb were now crouded into its mouth, and &s;potted with its harmle&s;s blood. Poor little fellow, &s;aid I, thou wert ye&s;terday the merrie&s;t of the fri&s;king tribe! Would I never had met thee!</P>
<P>If, in the cour&s;e of the week, it was my lot to <HI>eat</HI> any part of the&s;e animals, at the tables where I then vi&s;ited, as it is mo&s;t probable was the ca&s;e, con&s;ider <HI>poor human nature,</HI> and forgive me! I am not prepo&s;terous enough to advi&s;e a being, who is made up of appetites to ab&s;tain from the gratification of &s;uch as are nece&s;&s;ary to exi&s;tence, but while we yield to the &s;tern laws of our mortality, let us not, you, I am &s;ure,
<PB N="53" REF="64">will not, &s;purn all &s;ort of feeling, like the man, who, on &s;eeing &s;ome lambs at &s;port in a meadow, exclaimed,&mdash;"Ah, ye dear, innocent, beautiful creatures, would to heaven I had a joint of ye to-day for dinner, with nice &s;pinnage and butter!"</P>
<P>A very different &s;entiment &s;prung up in my mind as I &s;urveyed the amputated limbs of the&s;e my late a&s;&s;ociates. You remember what the heart-melting Otway &s;ays on the &s;ubject:
<Q><L>"Lead, lead me like a tame lamb to &s;acrifice,</L>
<L>"Thus in his fatal garlands, fine and pleas'd</L>
<L>"The wanton &s;kips and plays&mdash;</L>
<L>"Trots by th' inticing, flattering, prie&s;te&s;s &s;ide,</L>
<L>"And much tran&s;ported with his little pride,</L>
<L>"Forgets his dear companions of the plain,</L>
<L>"Till, by her bound, he's on the altar lain</L>
<L>"And then too hardly bleats.</L></Q></P>
<P>Never can this affecting pa&s;&s;age be more touchingly illu&s;trated than in the ca&s;e of my lamb of We&s;tphalia.</P>
<P>The &s;heep of this very beautiful country, however, are not &s;o well-looking, nor &s;o good, in point of food, as might be expected from the rich abundance of their pa&s;turage, and the purity of their air. They are longer in the vi&s;age, body, and legs than ours: Their fleeces are more ragged and dirty. How different in colour and countenance, from the fair flocks
<PB N="54" REF="65">gleaned in our fir&s;t &s;heaf, that climb the moun|tains, and fri&s;k along the valleys of our Cam|bria! A &s;heep in Wales is really an intere&s;ting being; you &s;ee its mild face peep unexpectedly from the fi&s;&s;ure of a rock, in the mid&s;t of an enormous pile of ruinous &s;tones; or you have a full length view as it repo&s;es at the mouth of a fine natural cave; or you ob&s;erve it looking down upon you from a &s;tupendous ridge of rocks, on the extreme verge of which it &s;eems to hang, till you feel &s;omething like an appre|hen&s;ion it &s;hould tumble into the vale below and be de&s;troyed: but, even while your &s;ympathy is thus engaged in its welfare, the wanton crea|ture, wild as the wind that bleaches it, and romantic as the &s;pots on which it feeds, will bound from the dizzy precipice where it &s;tood, to an height yet more fearful, and projecting its neck beyond where you imagine it po&s;&s;ible for it to keep the due equilibrium, will crop the herbage that vegetates among&s;t the &s;tony ruins, or the flower that makes its flinty bed in the rocks, and will continue to climb and de&s;cend places, the perpendicular of which makes your eyes ake, and your head giddy; but the Cam|brian &s;heep takes its <HI>pa&s;time</HI> among&s;t the&s;e apparent dangers, with &s;o much ea&s;e and gaiety, you are &s;oon convinced it is rather an object of your envy than compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="66">Now in We&s;tphalia, and in mo&s;t other parts of Pru&s;&s;ia and Germany, the&s;e animals, after they have outlived the frolicks of lambhood, have le&s;s of this playfulne&s;s, and, indeed, be|come very &s;oon a &s;et of &s;erious, ruminating, ragged, and &s;olemn creatures.</P>
<P>The dog that guards them, however, is gene|rally a very plea&s;ant fellow. He is taught to dance, and has many other laughable humours and accompli&s;hments, but in his bu&s;ine&s;s is indefatigable. Wholly unlike the curs of Eng|land, where the apathy of the ma&s;ter &s;eems con|tagious, and where, even when following their flock, both appear to be <HI>walking in their &s;leep;</HI> the &s;hepherd dogs of this country are like &s;o many perpetual motions; if the &s;hepherd wi&s;hes to have them driven from one part of pa&s;turage to another, to divide, to congregate, or to conduct them to their fold, his dog begins his office, which is performed in the following manner. He runs round them in a circle, or rather three parts of a circle, leaving the fourth part open for their pa&s;&s;age, and he barks all the time. If any &s;traggler loiters by the way, he enlarges his round, till it includes the wan|derer, who is brought up with the re&s;t. He does his work in two equal &s;paces of ground, running from right to left, and from left to
<PB N="56" REF="67">right. It is truly a curious operation, and not a little fatiguing, &s;ince it &s;ometimes continues an hour together, without a moment's re&s;pite from barking and running. But, like many others, it is, for the mo&s;t part, labour in vain. The &s;heep are &s;o much in the habit of hearing this eternal yelper, that &s;o far from attending to his cries, I que&s;tion whether they hear his voice, like tho&s;e per&s;ons who live within the &s;ound of bells. At any rate, they pay no re|gard to it; for, while he is in full cry, the &s;heep &s;tep as lei&s;urely as if he was &s;ix feet under ground; even the ox I have mentioned in a former part of this letter, and my poor lamb, round whom he galloped in the &s;ame way, heeded him not. The fir&s;t turned him as it were, into contempt, and the la&s;t into ridicule, looking at him without fear, while his mouth was wide open, and, full of antic, joining him in his race. So that I begin to think our Engli&s;h &s;hepherd's cur does the bu&s;ine&s;s more effectually.</P>
<P>While I am upon the &s;ubject of the canine race, of which you know I am a profe&s;&s;ed friend and admirer, let me not forget to inform you of an excellent cu&s;tom prevalent in Hol|land, and in We&s;tphalia, re&s;pecting tho&s;e animals in the dog-days, namely, the law
<PB N="57" REF="68">which enacts their being &s;hut up during the &s;ultry &s;ea&s;on. The appearance of a dog of any kind in the &s;treets at &s;uch times is puni&s;hed with ju&s;t &s;everity. Now, as canine madne&s;s, perhaps the mo&s;t lamentable di&s;temper incident to human kind, is very rarely heard of in the various parts of the Continent that are the objects of the&s;e Gleanings, we mu&s;t impute it principally to the caution here de&s;cribed. "Go, and do likewi&s;e," is an admonition worthy the adoption of the people of England, who &s;uffer deplorable in&s;tances of di&s;traction and death, ari&s;ing from the want of &s;ome regu|lation on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Far, far from the friend of my heart be every malady of the body, and of the mind!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LX. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>CLEVES may be enrolled among&s;t the watering places, but as tho&s;e waters contain nothing to di&s;tingui&s;h them from a thou&s;and others, who&s;e ba&s;is is &s;teel, with a certain mix|ture of &s;alts and &s;ulphur, I know you will ea&s;ily|di&s;pen&s;e <PB N="58" REF="69">with a de&s;cription of them. Neither will I take up your time by a detail of the dinner or tea parties in the very wood I have now placed you. The&s;e &s;ort of accounts re|&s;emble the pictures which were cen&s;ured for being, though va&s;tly pretty, all alike. Water drinking, or dipping, places have, in them|&s;elves, but one character, and a de&s;cription of any, will, like Mr. Garrick's prologues, &s;erve as well for one place as another. If you turn to any book of travels, through any part of modern Europe, for mineral or &s;alt water, (to &s;ave trouble look in the index) and take that which comes fir&s;t to hand&mdash;no matter for the country&mdash;you will have a de&s;cription in point, for what has been &s;aid and done on the&s;e occa|&s;ions, &s;ince water-diving and drinking came into fa&s;hion; the &s;ame talkings, walkings, in|trigues, divorces, matches made, and matches broken, covert whi&s;pers, and open &s;candals, and all the old &s;tory of little and great con|&s;piracies, &s;ince the pa&s;&s;ions fir&s;t came into public. There is not left a remark, <HI>generally</HI> &s;peaking, on the&s;e &s;ubjects, worth a &s;ingle wheat-ear. So we will pa&s;s them by without gleaning, ju&s;t noting one or two <HI>particular</HI> habits of plea&s;ure that obtain in the neighbour|hood of the Cleves Wood.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="70">It is the practice for the Clevelanders to crowd on a fine Sunday to &s;ome very good tea-drinking hou&s;es, &s;ituate in the park, to &s;ee tum|bling boys and girls, and dancing dogs, and learned pigs, and poultry. The &s;pectators place them&s;elves in exten&s;ive alcoves, open at both ends: they almo&s;t all are to be &s;een in the <HI>hotte&s;t weather,</HI> drinking the <HI>hotte&s;t</HI> tea, with a dozen, and often two dozen, <HI>red-hot</HI> tea-urns under their very no&s;es. By way of auxiliary to this heat, the men all &s;moke, and take alternately a &s;up of tea, a &s;lice of bread, or cake, and a whiff of tobacco. The married women &s;nuff in proportion; the &s;pin&s;ters, born and educated amid&s;t fire and &s;moke, di&s;per&s;e the clouds with which their lovers and parents thus en|velope them: &s;ighs of tenderne&s;s, and whiffs of the be&s;t Virginia are puffed forth and mingle in the &s;ame breath, and the young lady melts in the mid&s;t of them. I do a&s;&s;ure you a kitchen fire in the dog-days is "dew-dropping cool|ne&s;s" to the being enclo&s;ed in this <HI>long green oven;</HI> and, what with the &s;calding water, on the one hand, and of the burning fires on the other, a &s;tranger finds him&s;elf almo&s;t &s;uffocated. The fir&s;t time that I my&s;elf was &s;tuck betwixt this Scylla and Charibdis, I feelingly &s;aw the force of cu&s;tom, which reconciled the mo&s;t delicate young women (for, in point of form
<PB N="60" REF="71">and feature, We&s;tphalia has many &s;uch to boa&s;t) to this hideous practice. They &s;eem as collected during this double attack as Generali&s;&s;imos of an army in the heat of action. After &s;taying till I was almo&s;t boiled on one &s;ide, and &s;moke-dried on the other, I fought my e&s;cape in the wood, the mo&s;t beautiful paths of which, as well public as private, where nature breathed the &s;weete&s;t air, di&s;played the mo&s;t enchanting pictures, and &s;ung the &s;ongs of gratitude and joy among her branches, were comparatively de&s;erted. I am &s;orry to &s;ay that all the con|certs, &s;ocieties, clubs, and other &s;ocial meetings, are deformed by tho&s;e in&s;ufferable fumigations, with which every hou&s;e, &s;hop, and even every garden, is infe&s;ted.</P>
<P>It is thought to be &s;alutary. Had it been confined to Holland, I might have po&s;&s;ibly come into this notion, as a corrector of bad air; but when I found it laid all Germany in <HI>&s;moke and a&s;hes,</HI> and thereby &s;pread over coun|tries "where every breeze is health," I &s;et it down as a vile cu&s;tom that &s;eeks to hide its filthine&s;s in a weak apology.</P>
<P>I cannot but reckon it lefs excu&s;eable than the &s;toves among&s;t women&mdash;a practice not le&s;s univer&s;al, but which the dampne&s;s of the
<PB N="61" REF="72">air, in the Provinces of Holland, may render nece&s;&s;ary. It is attended al&s;o by wor&s;e con|&s;equences; for there is nothing &s;o rare among&s;t the Dutch, Pru&s;&s;ians, or Germans, as a good &s;et of teeth: and as boys accu&s;tom them&s;elves to the u&s;e of a pipe almo&s;t as &s;oon as they can fill, hold, and light it, their teeth are di&s;coloured at a time of life when the youth of other coun|tries are alike pure in mind and per&s;on. This defect is the more obvious in the German young men, becau&s;e the females of the &s;ame age are remarkable for exhibiting rows of that pearly whitene&s;s, which, in Europe, at lea&s;t, has been u&s;ually thought &s;uch a con&s;tituent in per&s;onal beauty. The ladies, however, of Pru&s;&s;ia and Germany, being in the habit of &s;eeing a couple of black ranges in the mouths of their lovers and hu&s;bands, and to receive a whiff of &s;moke in their faces almo&s;t every time they a&s;&s;ociate, or are &s;poken to by the oppo&s;ite &s;ex (for imme|diately before and after, and &s;ometimes <HI>at</HI> meals they &s;moke) do not &s;eem to feel the contra&s;t.</P>
<P>I particularly remember to have been pre&s;ent at this very town of Cleves, when, among&s;t other company, were two young people, who had been given out as pa&s;&s;ionately fond of one another. The lady was playing at her forte piano, her lover, holding a pipe in one of the
<PB N="62" REF="73">filthie&s;t mouths I ever &s;aw, and accompanying her in a very pretty German air. This air &s;hewed the lady's fine rows of ivory to advan|tage, while it expo&s;ed her Coridon's ebony no le&s;s to view, and, at the end of the &s;ong, a &s;ly and quiet Gleaner, like my&s;elf, could perceive that the company were &s;o well plea&s;ed with the performers, and the performers with <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> that, not contented with the general acclama|tion of the friends, they &s;ealed the private ap|plau&s;e they be&s;towed upon <HI>one another</HI> with &s;o clo&s;e an approach of faces, that, though their con&s;cious &s;atisfaction was not expre&s;&s;ed and &s;ealed in a ki&s;s <HI>heard</HI> (or hardly &s;een) it cer|tainly was in a ki&s;s <HI>felt.</HI> No one who had been a &s;pectator of this &s;cene, would have agreed with the father of the fair-faced De&s;demona, in calling the love &s;he manife&s;ted for the moor <HI>unnatural.</HI> She had, like the pretty Cleve|lander, looked away the &s;able hue of Othello, and, &s;ince &s;he could not find his mind in his vi&s;age, di&s;covered his vi&s;age in his mind. Poetry, and, e&s;pecially, the poetry of Shak|&s;peare, which can do every thing, can, of cour&s;e, do this; but nothing, except that cu&s;tom, which the &s;ame immortal bard in|forms us
<Q><L>"Can make the flinty and &s;teel couch of war</L>
<L>"A thrice-driven-bed of down,"</L></Q>
<PB N="63" REF="74">or what is yet even &s;tronger than cu&s;tom, all-commanding love, could make a junction of the white&s;t and blacke&s;t, faire&s;t and foule&s;t teeth, a matter of delight!</P>
<P>Before I take you from this fair wood into the town of Cleves, I mu&s;t prepare you for a few other cu&s;toms which you will meet with there, and in other parts of the Duchy; and, indeed, in mo&s;t places of Germany.</P>
<P>Expect, in the fir&s;t place, to find the inha|bitants here, as in Holland, too civil by half: The courte&s;y of hat-pulling prevails in We&s;t|phalia to a degree really painful. It is a &s;ettled point for all natives to make bows to &s;trangers of almo&s;t every de&s;cription, &s;o that a traveller has little more to do in the con&s;iderable towns than to cover and uncover his head. Indeed, the hats them&s;elves &s;ufficiently &s;hew the preva|lence of the cu&s;tom, being all of them &s;queezed into a long roll, as compact as a polonie, on the take-off &s;ide, with the continual gripe of civility. In one of my fir&s;t excur&s;ions into this country, I took part of a carriage with a young man ju&s;t come from the Independent States of America, and glowing with all the unre&s;trained &s;pirit of his country. His objec|tions went to almo&s;t every thing he heard or
<PB N="64" REF="75">&s;aw in monarchies: they began with the head and de&s;cended to the feet; for he neither endured the uncovering of the one, nor the flexibility of the other. I honour'd this ardour of his principles, but wi&s;hed to make them relax a little to the cu&s;toms of a country. I began with the affair of the hat, which he &s;wore &s;hould be inveterately fixed on his head in his pa&s;&s;age through Holland; adding, that he looked upon obei&s;ance to every body, without di&s;tinc|tion, as a &s;ervility below the dignity of man's nature. Let me advi&s;e you my friend, and my readers, to be courteous; and to give into this &s;omewhat fatiguing practi&s;e. It will repay it&s;elf by many little urbanities you will wi&s;h for and find: the Germans and We&s;tpha|lians are an obliging race; and their exce&s;s of hat civility is better than the contrary extreme. But civility abroad is by no means confined to making you a pa&s;&s;ing-bow: and if it were, it is a &s;light tax upon a traveller to endure and return it.</P>
<P>I recollect being much plea&s;ed in Holland with a union of two things that rarely meet in any country. During my Hague gleaning, I was at the Playhou&s;e, when the beauty of two ladies, both on travel, excited the attention of the audience more than the performance. But
<PB N="65" REF="76">the ob&s;curity and gloom of the Hague theatre not clearly a&s;certaining that beauty, a great number of the &s;pectators were anxious to &s;ee more of the truth, and accordingly had arranged them&s;elves after the play, in two mighty rows, as if by common con&s;ent, to &s;ee the fair &s;trangers pa&s;s from their box to their carriage. In it&s;elf, this &s;et and determined &s;tare was certainly one of the rudene&s;&s;es of curio&s;ity; but in order to &s;moothe away its rough edges, the pa&s;&s;ing meteors no &s;ooner appeared within the lines, than, as if by common con&s;ent al&s;o, every hat was taken off, and every head bowed re|&s;pectfully to greet them. Even if the curio&s;ity, which beauty very naturally excites, did not carry, in &s;ome degree, its excu&s;e along with it, it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for that beauty to have been offended. In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance it produced, ju&s;t as it &s;hould do, a blu&s;h of courte&s;y and con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s as it pa&s;&s;ed along, not re&s;enting, though not inviting, the homage which it drew.</P>
<P>Who is there, my friend, that ever has pa&s;t b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> a &s;ingle winter in London, but mu&s;t have often &s;een the heroes of the box-lobby forming them&s;elves into a phalanx, hats on heads, and opera gla&s;&s;es at eyes, to &s;tare out of counte|nance, and out of the hou&s;e, perhaps amid&s;t in|decent <PB N="66" REF="77">ob&s;ervations, both beauty and innocence. Let us not quarrel then with civilities that &s;often away our di&s;gu&s;t; nor even with public curio&s;ity when it is tempered with public re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Be prepared, al&s;o, for the <HI>ki&s;&s;ing</HI> ceremony which you will find begin in Pru&s;&s;ian We&s;t|phalia, and extend over every part of the Ger|man territories. Neither treat it with ridicule or di&s;re&s;pect; for although it is the cu&s;tom for both &s;exes to embrace, and to pre&s;ent both &s;ides of the face for &s;alutation, after pa&s;&s;ing only an hour together, and though but next door neighbours, it means no more than our ex|changing the cu&s;tomary civilities of the moment <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant,</HI> in our own country: it &s;ignifies, in &s;hort, about as much as the mode of profe&s;&s;ing our&s;elves the obedient very humble &s;ervan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> tho&s;e indifferent people we meet with in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;treet, or addre&s;s by letter of bu&s;ine&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ceremony.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t repeat that the&s;e national habits ought always to be complied with. An ob&s;tinat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> refu&s;al in a young countryman of mine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> accept of a &s;alute was intended by him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> expre&s;s a &s;corn of the cu&s;tom it&s;elf, particularly in &s;uffering his cheek to come into momentary
<PB N="67" REF="78">contact with that of a <HI>man;</HI> but, by the gen|tleman who offered the &s;alute, it was con&s;trued into his having a bad breath, and a fear to di&s;cover it.</P>
<P>Now as an imputation of this kind would be more wounding to the &s;elf-love of our petit|maitres and maitre&s;&s;es, than, perhaps, an expul|&s;ion from ki&s;&s;ing all the days of their lives; I advi&s;e them to give and lend their cheeks for the ki&s;s of cu&s;tom without any farther he&s;itation.</P>
<P>I feel it my duty likewi&s;e to prepare you for a little impo&s;ition in the hotels and private lodgings before you enter them, as well as for the counterbalancing <HI>agr&eacute;mens.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t lay it down as a fir&s;t general principle, that a Pru&s;&s;ian and German landlord, if he po&s;&s;ibly can, will over-reach you; not &s;o much, I believe, from di&s;hone&s;ty, as from an almo&s;t <HI>innate</HI> idea of con&s;idering the word <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> &s;inonimous with the word <HI>riches.</HI> An Italian, French, and every other traveller, even a Dutchman, whom, generally &s;peaking, they know is well able to pay up to any price de|manded, may always get accommodated at half price, in compari&s;on of the Briti&s;h wanderer&mdash; that &s;elf-devoted victim of vanity and folly. Of this I will give you an in&s;tance, not pro|duced <PB N="68" REF="79">in re&s;entment, for it was rather a &s;ub|ject of plea&s;antry, but in order to put you, your friends, and every one into who&s;e hands the&s;e Gleanings may fall, on guard.</P>
<P>On my fir&s;t tour to Cleves I wi&s;hed to make a &s;top of a few months, and not readily &s;uiting my&s;elf in an Hotel, I &s;ought private apartments. A trade&s;man, of whom I had bought &s;ome trifling articles, and who &s;poke very good French, offered to attend me to the hou&s;e of a man who, he &s;aid, had rooms to lett; and added, that he would have the honour to be my interpreter.</P>
<P>We went accordingly, and I de&s;ired my In|terpreter to a&s;k the price of the Rooms, when, by way of an&s;wer, came forth another que&s;tion.</P>
<P><HI>Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e.</HI> The gentleman, I &s;up|po&s;e, is French.</P>
<P><HI>Interpreter.</HI> No.</P>
<P><HI>Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e.</HI> Dutch?</P>
<P><HI>Interpreter.</HI> No; Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>This information, con&s;i&s;ting only of two mono&s;yllables, had the effect of a volume on the man's mind. He intended, however, to be cautious and manage the intelligence; but his features betrayed him.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="80">He <HI>doubled</HI> upon me every article, as I &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;hew. I cau&s;ed him to be informed, that, on the receipt of my next letters from England, I &s;hould be able to decide whether I remained in the town, or proceeded farther up the country; ob&s;erving, that if I became his inmate, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to do without a &s;lip of carpeting, or &s;ome covering by the bed &s;ide.</P>
<P>That may be had, quoth the landlord; and &s;o we parted.</P>
<P>The expected letters arrived, and finding it convenient to pur&s;ue my route as far as Emeric, on the other &s;ide of the Rhine, I gave him notice two days earlier than my promi&s;e, that, as I &s;hould be ab&s;ent a month or &s;ix weeks, I would not hazard the letting his apartments to a more &s;tationary tenant &s;hould any &s;uch offer. Now, that this notice might be formal, it was tran&s;lated and delivered by my interpreter. Here, I &s;uppo&s;ed, we had done with one another; but the next morning, when every thing was ready for my departure, the ma&s;ter of the inn, where I had &s;lept, pre&s;ented me with a reply to my billet; written with a maje&s;ty of &s;tyle that would have better &s;uited the <HI>Grand Frederic</HI> (who, by the way, would have given a much<PB N="70" REF="81">more courteous an&s;wer) than the little great man who was the author, or rather dictator, for he under&s;tood even le&s;s of the French than I of the German, and was at the expence of a notary&mdash;<HI>Voil&agrave; le decret de&s;potique de mon Maitre d'Hotel.</HI>&mdash;But as all great events, in which great per&s;onages are concerned, are u&s;hered in with due decorum, I &s;hall allot a &s;eparate gleaning to it.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>As a Pru&s;&s;ian curio&s;ity, you will accept a literal tran&s;lation of it, courteous reader, if peradventure thou art not &s;ufficiently in prac|tice with the French language, to feel the might and maje&s;ty of the &s;entiments. You, I know, my dear friend, can reli&s;h them in all their original bomba&s;t.</P>
<P><LABEL>TRANSLATION.</LABEL>
<Q>Perhaps, Sir, you imagine you may act here as you do in England, where every one does ju&s;t as he plea&s;es. No. We live under the government of a king&mdash;<HI>Such a King!</HI> who &s;upports the rights of his meane&s;t &s;ubjects. And who&s;oever dares to &s;uppo&s;e he may play the game he does in Great Britain, within the territory of his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty, will find him&s;elf mi&s;taken. It was not at my invita|tion you came to my hou&s;e; it was an act of
<PB N="72" REF="83">your own free will; and you have hired my chambers. You de&s;ired I would cover the boards with a carpet; a carpet I have bought, and the boards are covered. My bed, too, has been taken down in one place and put up in another to plea&s;e you, and I am thereby di&s;arranged. For all this, I expect to have my damages made good, and as you do not choo&s;e to occupy the lodgings, I de&s;ire to know, whether you choo&s;e to pay for them! I &s;peak of the three months for which they are let to you? If yes, well; if no, I &s;hall &s;eek my right from the laws of the land, whereof I have the honour to be a member!</Q></P>
<P>Boooo!&mdash;There's for you! Was ever the Pope's bull fulminated with more ven|geance!</P>
<P>"Myn Heer, &s;aid my landlord, had better po&s;tpone his journey, till this little, ugly affair is &s;ettled; for there is no an&s;wering to the lengths this hot-headed man may go; and to be &s;topped on the road by the officers of ju&s;tice would be di&s;agreeable. Officers of ju&s;tice! officers of non&s;en&s;e! &s;aid I. I &s;ent for my interpreter, who, though a native of the place, did not, by good luck, take the part of his town&s;man. On the contrary, he accompanied me, &s;wearing all
<PB N="73" REF="84">the way in High Dutch never to have made any mention of three months, nor any contract what&s;oever. He increa&s;ed his pace in propor|tion as he increa&s;ed his oaths, and the&s;e running affidavits pre&s;ently brought us to the &s;cene of action. The landlord was in the very chamber in di&s;pute, which we found, &s;ure enough, &s;uf|ficiently deranged. Had a &s;core of &s;wine herded in them, they could not have been in a more filthy &s;ituation. Neither curtains, nor mat, nor carpet, nor any furniture, but that of which I had at fir&s;t complained. The fury of the interpreter was equal to the di&s;may of the Pru&s;&s;ian dictator. Our vi&s;it to the latter was &s;o unexpected, and our detection of him &s;o unequivocal, that he could not reply to the denunciations of my lingui&s;t, who, pur&s;uing his advantages, laid about him like a Draw|can&s;ir. The ho&s;t, at la&s;t, felt him&s;elf galled, and ventured the retort <HI>uncourteous:</HI> this pro|duced a rejoinder, that again a replication, which ran through the whole vocabulary of angry eloquence; in the heat of which I left the combatants, and with great coolne&s;s de|parted for Emeric; but on pa&s;&s;ing Cleves &s;ome months after, I fell in company with the very gentleman who occupied the&s;e memorable apartments, for the u&s;e of which, his board inclu&s;ive, he paid, to a &s;tiver, <HI>per month,</HI> what had
<PB N="74" REF="85">been demanded of me <HI>per week!</HI> but then, he was a Pru&s;&s;ian and I&mdash;an Engli&s;hman!</P>
<P>I cannot write this latter name, without an almo&s;t equal mixture of pride and indignation, plea&s;ure and regret. I grieve that it is rendered le&s;s re&s;pectable abroad than at home, and that, by the pur&s;e-proud vanity, or di&s;&s;ipated pageantry of individuals, the character of an whole nation &s;uffers. More than once, in the cour&s;e of the&s;e Gleanings, have I been forced upon this unwelcome &s;ubject; and I mu&s;t now take it up again, becau&s;e I can no other way, my loved friend, account to you, or to the public, for a multitude of impo&s;itions which lie in re&s;erve, which are ab&s;olutely in <HI>waiting,</HI> for my countrymen, the moment they have cro&s;&s;ed the Channel, and which, like co&s;tly and trouble&s;ome companions, fa&s;ten them&s;elves to his pur&s;e-&s;trings, till they "leave not a rack behind." For all which, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> have nobody to blame but them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place they take over with them Engli&s;h ideas of expence into other countries.</P>
<P>Secondly, They take over, al&s;o, a large cargo of national pride, wi&s;hing to &s;pread the general
<PB N="75" REF="86">received notion of Engli&s;h wealth being greater than that of other countries.</P>
<P>Thirdly, They are in a habit of prodigality at home which is too inveterate in wa&s;te, to make economical retrenchments abroad: and, even if they &s;et out on a &s;aving principle, they &s;oon glide into the extravagant pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Now, from a co-operation of all the&s;e, it is really wonderful to con&s;ider how wide the mi&s;|chief is di&s;fu&s;ed. A Swi&s;s officer and Pru&s;&s;ian gentleman counciled me to let a friend of theirs make my bargains and purcha&s;es, as we were to travel &s;ome time in company, and make &s;tops at the &s;ame places. I yielded to this good advice, but counteracted its effect by being his a&s;&s;ociate. It was found out, by &s;ome means or another, that I was an Engli&s;hman, and that was more than enough. The per&s;ons&mdash;whether Dutch, Pru&s;&s;ians, or Germans&mdash;mean not to over-reach you. They intend only to a&s;k up to the character our countrymen have e&s;tabli&s;hed for riches. They even de&s;ign &s;ometimes an extortion as a compliment, be|cau&s;e it pre-&s;uppo&s;es the pre-eminent wealth of our nation. They argue, too, that while you come &s;o many hundred, or thou&s;and leagues from home, it is not po&s;&s;ible you &s;hould
<PB N="76" REF="87">want money, &s;ince, if you did, you would natu|rally &s;tay at home.</P>
<P>Thus a fooli&s;h ambition of keeping up a fal&s;e reputation begins on the other &s;ide of the water, and travels with you to the end both of water and land. Taking London as the center, it has gone in as many directions as there are great po&s;t roads, even to the once cheap parts of the Briti&s;h empire, York&s;hire, Scotland, and Wales. In every inch of the&s;e, you feel the heavy hand of an Engli&s;h traveller's profu&s;ion forced into your pocket. Tho&s;e nece&s;&s;aries of life, which thirty years back might be com|fortably procured for the third of their pre&s;ent purcha&s;e at an Engli&s;h market, &s;oon mounted to the half, then they ro&s;e to three parts; and now, unle&s;s you enter into engagements very advi&s;edly, the difference of Engli&s;h expendi|ture will &s;carcely warrant the charge of taking &s;o long a journey. Shall I be an&s;wered, that the difference in the&s;e gradations ari&s;es from the dif|ference of the times, refinements, luxuries, &amp;c.? Certainly the&s;e increa&s;e the evil: but, even at this day, as I &s;tated to you in a former letter, the great articles of life are to be had at more than an half in half average with the Engli&s;h market. It will a&s;&s;uredly be granted, that fi&s;h,
<PB N="77" REF="88">fle&s;h, fowl, eggs, butter, and hou&s;e-rent, are the <HI>chief</HI> of tho&s;e articles, and all the&s;e are to be had as I have before de&s;cribed. The fair in|ference is, that where taxation or refinement have levied one impo&s;t, national pride and habitual folly have levied twenty. The natives them&s;elves, both in the above countries, and in tho&s;e more remote, have candour enough to acknowledge this; but <HI>now,</HI> the habit of charge is as &s;trong as the profu&s;ion by which it was at fir&s;t created; and the &s;implicity and oeco|nomy of a place once de&s;troyed, like a wounded character, never recovers it&s;elf. On the con|trary, extortion and extravagance erect a &s;ort of temple to Folly on their ruins; and an impo&s;ition <HI>taught to others by our&s;elves,</HI> becomes the cu&s;tom of a country, till, in the end, foreigners think they have a pre&s;umptive right to cheat you. The &s;ame &s;pirit that induces us to &s;poil the places nearer home, enables us to ruin our re&s;idences and accommodations abroad. Our profu&s;ion traver&s;es the whole continent of Europe; the Alps and Pyrennees &s;ink before it, and wherever, as in We&s;tphalia, from the natural abundance of a country, or the want of traffic, or di&s;tance from a public mart, the nece&s;&s;aries of life are <HI>&s;till</HI> to be got at half price, they would, I am convinced,

<P>Under the&s;e comfortle&s;s pro&s;pects of being impo&s;ed upon by our own countrymen's folly, even when <HI>out</HI> of England&mdash;for I in&s;i&s;t on it, they are the aggre&s;&s;ors&mdash;I do not think I can render to my countrymen at this di&s;tance from them&mdash;or to you, my friend, whom I &s;uppo&s;e to be &s;o near, a greater &s;ervice&mdash;than to note the actual rates of living, and the comparative dearne&s;s or cheapne&s;s of the &s;everal countries in which I have re&s;ided. This is certainly another very humble office, but a no le&s;s u&s;eful one, and either on account of its humility or utility, has been &s;trangely mi&s;repre&s;ented or overlooked.</P>
<P>Once more making England a centrical point of travelling, the expenditure will be found to a&s;cend in a &s;eries as you pa&s;s along, <HI>i. e.</HI> the farther removed from the center, the le&s;s you &s;pend&mdash;&s;uppo&s;ing a le&s;s influence from examples of Engli&s;h extravagance.</P>
<P>The difference of charge, even to perfect &s;trangers,&mdash;and making allowances for a <HI>pre|determination,</HI> almo&s;t every where, to over|reach <PB N="79" REF="90">you to the verge of the laws of the land,&mdash;is almo&s;t incredible. What Engli&s;h travelling at <HI>home</HI> comes to, I need not &s;tate, either in lodgings, at inns, or on the road. Hou&s;eing you &s;afe on this &s;ide of the water, you immediately would perceive the difference, were you di&s;po&s;ed to begin your e&s;timate; for, although you may be chagrined at the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of keeping your pur&s;e in the hand, in your tour through Holland, were you to &s;epa|rate one charge from another, you would, even admitting &s;ome extortion, find the balance in favour of Dutch impo&s;ition. No, my friend, thrown, without the arms of language, ac|quaintance, or experience of cu&s;toms, on the mercy of the Hollanders, you would la&s;t longer, that is, you would be le&s;s <HI>&s;peedily</HI> devoured by the Dutch than by your own countrymen, under like circum&s;tances. But though your devo|ration would be more <HI>&s;low,</HI> it would not be le&s;s <HI>&s;ure; i. e.</HI> were you not to buy, and dearly buy, knowledge as you go on, and had you no hone&s;t and diligent way-faring traveller to glean the paths before you.</P>
<P>Leaving you, however, as ju&s;t ob&s;erved, un|defended among&s;t the Hollanders, you would not &s;o &s;oon be &s;wallowed up as by the Engli&s;h. The difference of charges is re|markable <PB N="80" REF="91">in going only from one province to another, and when you have left the Dutch boundaries and gained the Pru&s;&s;ian dominions, you perceive the cheating of one country &s;o much more endurable than that of another, that in this in&s;tance, at lea&s;t, whatever may be your political principles, you would prefer the de&s;potic States to the Republics&mdash;and exclaim with poor Lear,
<Q><L>"The wicked compared with the more wicked</L>
<L>"Seem beautiful, and not to be the wor&s;t</L>
<L>"Stands in &s;ome rank of prai&s;e."</L></Q> I believe I have u&s;ed this quotation in &s;ome former letter, but it becomes appo&s;ite again, and you will excu&s;e repetition. <HI>How</HI> well it applies at pre&s;ent, you &s;hall immediately judge. At the be&s;t inn of Cleves, my charge, for twelve days, was little more than a guinea &s;terling; and for which I was accommodated with a very good bed-room, the u&s;e of the general &s;itting-room and an excellent table, adorned with the be&s;t company, as well re&s;i|dents as travellers. At one of the large&s;t inns of the Hague, it co&s;t me preci&s;ely that &s;um, a guinea, for <HI>one day's</HI> wor&s;e living, wor&s;e lodg|ing, and wor&s;e attendance. Having mentioned to you the name of the more rea&s;onable Hague landlord, I tru&s;t your faith in my account will
<PB N="81" REF="92">lead you to choo&s;e the good and to avoid the bad; and therefore it becomes unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;pecify the per&s;on by whom I was thus over|charged. But ju&s;tice requires I &s;hould tell you and the world, that the name of the Cleves landlord is Ny&s;a.</P>
<P>To prevent the trouble of enquiry, and the vexation of being reduced to conte&s;ts at a place of public accommodation, I will take this opportunity to &s;et down the &s;ixed prices of all the mo&s;t reputable table d'hotes (public eating-hou&s;es and hotels) in the provinces of Holland and in Pru&s;&s;ian We&s;tphalia.</P>

<P><PB N="82" REF="93">In Holland, the train of waiters, &s;hoe-boys, &amp;c. are at the heels of your bill, and interrupt (though not with equal boldne&s;s of <HI>authority</HI>) your way to the hor&s;e or carriage.

The above &s;tatement then will &s;erve you through both countries from Helveot&s;luice or the Hague, to the farthe&s;t end of the Pru&s;&s;ian States: and the variations are unimportant in your route to Berlin on the one hand, and to Vienna on the other.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be noted, that the money of Hol|land is nominally double that of Pru&s;&s;ia. I &s;ay nominally, becau&s;e in the <HI>exchange</HI> it makes little to a traveller's advantage; but in pur|cha&s;e of the articles of life, it is half in half. Indeed the coin (more e&s;pecially the &s;ilver) is of &s;o ba&s;e materials, that the circulation is almo&s;t wholly confined to Pru&s;&s;ia.

Luckily, however, the price of public boats, and public carriages, are &s;ettled by ordinance, though even this is liable to abu&s;e, and the Seller &s;ometimes pa&s;&s;es a cheat on the Buyer, under the pretended &s;anction of Government.

They &s;hall be
<PB N="84" REF="95">given in the &s;upplementary pages of this clo&s;ing &s;heaf, where a number of pickings-up &s;hall be thrown into one or two general letters, pro|perly &s;peaking, a letter of &s;craps on different &s;ubjects, gathered in different countries; valuable, perhaps, when made into a collection, but too minute to &s;tand alone. I have many of the&s;e lieing in &s;lips of paper, on the backs or edges of letters, in my drawer of memorandas, which I fill as I empty my pockets after a walk, a ride, a vi&s;it, &amp;c. &amp;c. and I &s;hall &s;et apart a &s;tay-at-home-day, to arrange and tran&s;mit them. Meantime, we are, ju&s;t now, too much in the heat of bu&s;ine&s;s, in Gleaning the things of the <HI>fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ity</HI> (alas! poor dear human nature, of what eating and drinking, and other frail materials, art thou compounded) to amu&s;e our|&s;elves with affairs le&s;s &s;olid. If a traveller wi&s;hes to become re&s;identiary for a few weeks or months in any of the plea&s;ant German towns, and brings with him his family, the be&s;t way is to make an agreement with a traiteur (a
<PB N="85" REF="96">cook) and live with him, if, as is often the ca&s;e, he happens to have a good hou&s;e. This, be&s;ides the accommodation of having your repa&s;t comfortable and warm, is cheaper by nearly half, as it <HI>includes</HI> the price of a room. I know a gentleman, who &s;ays he is well &s;erved with breakfa&s;ts and dinners, (&s;uppers are rarely taken abroad) and two good chambers, for twenty-one florins (about one guinea at par) per month, in a very popular part of Pru&s;&s;ian We&s;tphalia. But even if you take private lodgings, and are only &s;upplied from a traiteur's with eatables, you gain importantly on Eng|land&mdash;as thus, <HI>Dinners,</HI> (which imply a &s;uf|ficiency for &s;uppers, as you always are entitled to keep what is &s;ent you) are twelve Holland &s;tivers a-head&mdash;about a &s;hilling Engli&s;h. It is called one portion; it con&s;i&s;ts of four covered di&s;hes, which, with bread, chee&s;e, butter, and &s;allads (that are always found by your&s;elf) con|tain enough for two meals; as two portions do for four.</P>
<P>I was pre&s;ent at a bargain of this kind being made at Cleves, with one of the many publick cooks of that place: he was on the edge of becoming a victim to his ignorance in the&s;e matters, when an hone&s;t Pru&s;&s;ian who was pre&s;ent, with a friendly pre&s;ence of mind,
<PB N="86" REF="97">ob&s;erved to the cook&mdash;"Certainement Mon|&s;ieur e&s;t un peu Catholique; il ne mange pas de viande <HI>tous les jours.</HI> I took the hint, and told the man that when I wanted a double portion, he &s;hould know it in time to make the nece&s;&s;ary addition. This reduced the monthly charge, which had previou&s;ly been made, to about one pound fifteen &s;hillings.</P>
<P>Let me not fail to apprize you, moreover, that the buying your wine of a merchant, and of an hotel-keeper, or cook, is, on an average, difference of more than half in half in Holland, Pru&s;&s;ia, and Germany.</P>
<P>At the inns of Holland, you will pay for table-wine, one florin ten &s;tivers (half a crown); at tho&s;e of Pru&s;&s;ia and Germany, from &s;ixteen &s;tivers to one florin; and at the merchants of the fir&s;t country, for the &s;ame wine, eight &s;tivers, and in the two other countries, &s;o low as &s;ix &s;tivers, or &s;even at mo&s;t: and let it not be forgotten that the eight penny wine is pre|ci&s;ely the &s;ame, as to quality, for which (with duties on foreign &s;pirits) you pay in England from five to &s;even &s;hillings a bottle.</P>
<P>There are certain articles &s;o incredibly cheap, even in the&s;e times of general &s;carcity <HI>every
<PB N="87" REF="98">where,</HI> that I want almo&s;t confidence in my own conviction, or in my tru&s;t of your candour, to make ju&s;t report of them. In various pro|vincial towns, both in the neighbourhood of the Upper and Lower Rhine, the be&s;t butter is &s;old, in the month of May, at two-pence per pound, a very fine young fowl, at four and five pence, a duck the &s;ame, butcher's meat at two-pence, and two-pence halfpenny, a full grown hare at eight, nine, or ten-pence, &s;ometimes at &s;till le&s;s, a goo&s;e, or turkey, at ten-pence, when at the deare&s;t, and the fine&s;t We&s;tphalia ham from three-pence to four-pence per pound. Hou&s;e-rent is in proportion. I leave you, therefore, to judge, how comfort|able a family, pinched for nece&s;&s;aries, and, perhaps, &s;truggling betwixt the extremes of pride and poverty in England, may live in the German territories. And yet I &s;till cannot help giving Wales the preference for two rea&s;ons&mdash;fir&s;t, becau&s;e it is nearly as cheap, and in a part of my own country, and does not take money out of the Briti&s;h dominions; and &s;econdly, becau&s;e it contains more general beauty than any thing to be met with without taking a long journey, which, with a family, is in it&s;elf the expenditure of more than could be expected from a twelve-month's &s;avings. As the retreat of an unconnected per&s;on, or of a
<PB N="88" REF="99">family, re&s;olved to e&s;tabli&s;h in a new country, and, as Dr. Young &s;ays, <HI>fixing would be fixed,</HI> it would be really a &s;aving, without abridge|ment of comforts, and even luxuries, of thirty or forty per cent. Eggs are frequently fifteen for two-pence, and &s;eldom le&s;s than ten; and firing is proportionably cheap. Bread, however, is nearly the &s;ame price as in England; I mean &s;uch as is made from the white flour; but they grow an inferior kind, con&s;iderably darker when baked than our farm-hou&s;e loaves, which is eaten with a farm-hou&s;e appetite, not only by the pea&s;antry, but mo&s;t other people. By way of qualifying its bitter and &s;our ta&s;te, the better &s;orts of folks place their butter betwixt a &s;lice of the black and a &s;lice of the white bread, and when they wi&s;h to luxuriate, as on a dainty, or to di&s;tingui&s;h their ho&s;pitality to a friend, a two penny loaf of the entire white is brought forth, and cut into as many mor&s;els as there are per&s;ons to be regaled.</P>
<P>It will &s;eem incredible to an Engli&s;h reader, whatever be his &s;ituation, to be told that a German bill of fare con&s;i&s;ts of little more than what is appointed for a meagre day, rigidly maintained; in&s;omuch that the We&s;tphalians, Pru&s;&s;ians, and Germans, in general, may be duly and truly &s;aid to keep Lent all the year.
<PB N="89" REF="100">I am authori&s;ed by truth to a&s;&s;ure you, from long experience of their table, that the yearly expenditure of a large family, in any of the above-named countries, would &s;carce exceed, if it could reach, that of an Engli&s;h farmer's hou&s;ehold, con&s;i&s;ting of an equal number of people, for a &s;ingle month. An enormous di&s;h of potatoes, cabbages, carrots, beans, and other vegetables, forms the ba&s;is of their dinner, which, with all ranks, is taken at twelve o'clock. It is a very great luxury when half a pound of pork, bacon, or butcher's meat is &s;tuck in the mid&s;t of this medley, as the grand center of attraction; and yet this precious mor&s;el is rather for ornament than u&s;e, rather to be admired and gazed on, like other for|bidden fruit, than eaten. A variety of trifles from the garden forms the de&s;ert, which is rather ta&s;ted than enjoyed, if there happens to be any thing more <HI>recherch&eacute;,</HI> more valuable, than a nut or an apple; and a &s;mall plate-full even of the&s;e become &s;o "familiar to the eye," that they pall upon the &s;en&s;e before you are pre|&s;ented with a fre&s;h &s;upply. I prote&s;t to you that I was &s;o accu&s;tomed to look on a fruit plate and its contents for &s;uch a length of time, at a table in We&s;tphalia, that I knew every &s;peck and freckle about them, as well as the faces of the family. Indeed I had opportu|nities <PB N="90" REF="101">to &s;ee them &s;o con&s;tantly, and clo&s;ely, that each apple and pear became a <HI>memento mori to the family.</HI>&mdash;In the beginning of the week, they came fre&s;h from the tree, with their be&s;t look and blooming complexions. A very few of them, alas, were cut off in this the prime of their lives. The re&s;t were brought on the &s;econd day, not much altered in their &s;hapes or air. On the third, there was a vi&s;ible alte|ration&mdash;neverthele&s;s, the young folks of the family, for there were many children,
<Q><L>"Sigh'd and look'd, &s;igh'd and look'd,</L>
<L>"Sigh'd and look'd, and &s;igh'd again."</L></Q> but, alas, &s;igh'd and look'd, look'd and &s;igh'd, &s;igh'd and long'd in vain. It was written in the father's face&mdash;ye may not eat: while the indulgent matron cut one into as many quarters as &s;he had &s;ons and daughters, and the next day the father, being in a frolic&s;ome humour, threw an apple and a pear after dinner among&s;t them, on the floor, where they were as much fought for as Jo&s;eph's coat, and produced as much &s;hame to the vanqui&s;hed, and triumph to the conquerors, as if they were heroes and kings, battling it away for thrones and domi|nions, perhaps, on the true e&s;timate, as little worthy of conte&s;t. Towards the end of the week, my old friends in the fruit-plate
<PB N="91" REF="102">began to drop off one by one; and though it is among&s;t my habits never to eat of tho&s;e things which the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e di&s;covers to me by his manner he con&s;iders as a rarity; in com|pa&s;&s;ion to the&s;e poor things, I took off their du&s;ty coats, and thereby prevented a more lingering death.</P>
<P>Some weeks after, I dined at the &s;ame gen|tleman's hou&s;e, and though, to be &s;ure, a man would not choo&s;e to &s;wear to an apple, I could all but make oath, that I ob&s;erved, among&s;t the re-enforcements of the well remembered fruit-plate, one pippen which was &s;o palpable by his marks, that I recogni&s;ed him as an old acquaintance the moment he came in my view &mdash;now be it known to you, this was by no means in the &s;ea&s;on of the year, when apples are laid up like honey in the hive for winter pro|vi&s;ion, but when they would in England have come fre&s;h from the tree, at every meal. It is &s;trict economy that urges this extreme for|bearance in almo&s;t every thing that regards, in &s;hort, that either &s;mells or ta&s;tes like a luxury. And it is impo&s;ed by a very &s;tern nece&s;&s;ity, for Germany and poverty are almo&s;t &s;ynonimous terms, and though, in particular in&s;tances, &s;uch a thing as wealth is to be found,
<PB N="92" REF="103">the general run of people in all conditions, are reduced to ob&s;erve a mo&s;t &s;crupulous frugality in all things; their income being u&s;ually &s;uch as to inhibit the lea&s;t article of profu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Nor is this oeconomy confined to the appetites, it extends to the ornaments of life; I had almo&s;t &s;aid to its vanities, but it may be done in effect to promote the&s;e. You &s;hall decide on this, after I have informed you it is the univer&s;al practi&s;e to undre&s;s after a vi&s;it. A lady, or gentleman, no &s;ooner returns home, than they lay a&s;ide their co&s;tly robes, and get into their &s;lippers, nightgowns, yea and night|caps al&s;o. And appear extremely &s;urpri&s;ed to learn it is a general cu&s;tom in England to keep on their out of door dre&s;&s;es, as they are called in Germany, when they are among&s;t family friends; nor could I ea&s;ily reconcile them to my following the cu&s;tom of my country in this particular, till I had a&s;&s;ured them, changing my dre&s;s frequently gave me cold. They call this &s;tripping practice putting them&s;elves at their ea&s;e: but it is, in truth, purely done for oeconomy.</P>
<P>Frugality is an early part of education in the&s;e countries, in&s;omuch, that it is common to
<PB N="93" REF="104">ob&s;erve a well-bred young lady, in &s;ome of the be&s;t families, wa&s;h up the tea-things, im|mediately after they are done with, and in the mid&s;t of the company, who have been u&s;ing them. At fir&s;t, I &s;uppo&s;ed this was a menial office, impo&s;ed by a cro&s;s papa, or over|managing mamma; but when I became a re|&s;identiary gleaner, I &s;aw it &s;o much the fa&s;hion of every family, that I inform you of it as a general rule, not only in Germany, but in Holland al&s;o.</P>
<P>The natives of the&s;e places not only eat &s;paringly, as having little to eat, but they eat &s;eldom&mdash;and drink as often as they can. The cu&s;tom of &s;light breakfa&s;ts, vegetable, or rather hodge-podge dinners, and yet &s;lighter, frequently no &s;uppers, has its beginning in Holland, travels to We&s;tphalia, like a &s;lender current, narrowing as it goes, with re&s;pect to quantum, and is at its perfection of oeconomy in the empire. The only thing in which they yield to profu&s;ion, (at their own expence) is in the article of tea and coffee: this they take almo&s;t every hour, but <HI>without &s;ugar.</HI> The women &s;nuff, and the men &s;moke over it. But they u&s;ually drink it out of cups that &s;carce hold &s;o much as an acorn; and though, from the quantity taken, this cu&s;tom gives perpetual
<PB N="94" REF="105">trouble, they &s;till prefer the&s;e diminutive machines, which would &s;carce &s;erve a fairy to &s;ip dew drops. To think of a wide Dutch mouth &s;crewed up to the dimen&s;ions of &s;uch a &s;prite!</P>
<P>It is, I find, very true, that the Engli&s;h are every where looked on to be exceedingly car|nivorous; and it is true al&s;o, that an Engli&s;h|man will devour more &s;olid fle&s;h in a day, and pour down his throat more inflammatory liquid, than a Pru&s;&s;ian, German, or Dutch|man, in <HI>three</HI> days. An Engli&s;h traveller, however, &s;oon a&s;&s;imilates to the general temper|ance of the country, the con&s;equence of which is, that in&s;tead of wa&s;ting an whole afternoon in an hot room, amid&s;t the fumes of the table; or &s;leeping to relieve an overloaded &s;tomach, he feels alert, either for bu&s;ine&s;s, or plea&s;ure, and &s;eems to wonder at this change of him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t mentioned to you the early dinners on this part of the Continent, but for|got to note to you, that the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for it, is exactly the rever&s;e of what is given out for a four or five o'clock repa&s;t in Great Britain. We eat at mid-day, &s;ays the foreigner, that we may have a long afternoon: We eat in the evening, &s;ays the Engli&s;hman, that we may
<PB N="95" REF="106">have a long morning. The cu&s;toms of a coun|try ought certainly to give and receive allowances, but I have found this difference in the hours productive of great difficulties, be|tween &s;ome of my countrymen and foreigners; the fir&s;t in&s;i&s;ting that as twelve o'clock was too late for breakfa&s;t and too &s;oon for dinner, it could be con&s;idered only as the hour proper for a luncheon; and the other declaring, that &s;itting down to table at &s;uch an un&s;ea&s;onable time was in&s;upportable: for my own part, I am ble&s;t with &s;o &s;ocial an appetite, that it &s;eems made for a ready compliance with the cu&s;toms of all countries. Is it the fa&s;hion of the family to eat at noon? I &s;it down and forget that I had not been u&s;ed to think about dinner till nearer night. Does my meal make its appear|ance with the candles? Be it &s;o, I eat heartily, if I am well; and, if I am &s;ick, I play with my knife and fork, to keep tho&s;e who are better company. Now this ver&s;atility in my di&s;po&s;i|tion leads me into many plea&s;ures and content|ments, which le&s;s accommodating tempers can never hope to enjoy. It is peculiarly e&s;timable in travelling: for can it be rea&s;onably expected, that without being well paid for it, people will come into the cu&s;toms of a &s;tranger, and forego their own? Will you tell them, it is <HI>polite</HI> to go to dinner when they are going to &s;upper! Or
<PB N="96" REF="107">as an individual are you to derange a family, who, in turn, could tell you, that the politene&s;s of their country &s;ettles the&s;e matters on very different principles. Who is to adju&s;t this knotty point? You fall out with your dinner, and with each other. How ea&s;ily would a little candour and courte&s;y place it ju&s;t where it &s;hould be!&mdash;O, good humour! thou lea&s;t dif|ficult, yet brighte&s;t of the &s;ocial virtues&mdash;thou creator and &s;upporter of every other&mdash;where is the land, the habit, the manners, which are not reconciled to the heart, by thy a&s;&s;ua&s;ive and &s;miling power? In&s;pired by thee, I feel my&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed to be happy, and I am &s;o; to impart it to all with whom I mix in this now jarring world, and I &s;ucceed:&mdash;And did the fond parent know thy value, as I know it, he would pray that his darling child was rather filled with thee, than favoured by beauty, genius, or fortune; for what are the&s;e but the mi&s;erable children of conceit, pride, and folly, unpro|tected and unin&s;pired by thee!</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid on the very nece&s;|&s;ary, though very much neglected, &s;ubject of eating and drinking, it will, I tru&s;t, appear manife&s;t, that if a traveller will be content to buy a little experience, which is no where to be had without paying for, and if he will
<PB N="97" REF="108">not be too much in a hurry to make his arrangements, and, while they are adju&s;ting, indulge his heart in a few effu&s;ions of that good-humour I have been addre&s;&s;ing, he may be very comfortable to him&s;elf, and no le&s;s acceptable to others; but if he will be &s;tubborn, and inflexibly attached to his own opinions, manners, and cu&s;toms, and not come into tho&s;e of other people in other countries, he has nothing to do but to live by him&s;elf, according to his fancy, and&mdash;pay accordingly.</P>
<P>But I forget, that all this time while I have been di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the &s;ubjects of the table, I have &s;eated you in the Cleves Wood, and left you in a wor&s;e &s;ituation even than the Germans, without any dinner at all. Ri&s;e then, my friend, and, that you may no longer want an opportunity, I put an end to my letter, with the u&s;ual a&s;&s;urances of being affectionately your's.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXII. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>TAKING it for granted that you will feel your&s;elf refre&s;hed before you &s;it down to the peru&s;al of another letter, and that all
<PB N="98" REF="109">tho&s;e who may become its readers will bring along with them good &s;pirits and <HI>goodnature,</HI> I will invite your attention to &s;ome further Gleanings on the circle of We&s;tphalia.</P>
<P>You are not now to learn that Pru&s;&s;ia is a Catholic country, where, however, Prote&s;tanti&s;m, (in the Pre&s;byterian form) is largely inter|&s;per&s;ed. The churches are every where the objects that fir&s;t catch the eyes of travellers, for which rea&s;on I &s;uppo&s;e it is that you meet &s;o many &s;teeples and towers, monuments and e&s;cutcheons, in almo&s;t every book of modern travels.</P>
<P>Catholic churches in particular, as being more ornamental, have been &s;o often de&s;cribed by <HI>publi&s;hing</HI> travellers, that they are, perhaps, the only objects in the wide field of foreign ob&s;ervation, which have been mea&s;ured with an accuracy that leaves nothing for the gleaner. Open the books of the&s;e authors at whatever page you may, and it is odds but you &s;ee half a dozen &s;pires, followed by a long hi&s;tory of their founders, de&s;troyers, rebuilders, re|de&s;troyers, revolutions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Two churches and a ca&s;tle to a leaf is moderate reckoning, and it is well if you get off without a mor&s;el of choice biography, on the quarrels and rogueries, virtues,
<PB N="99" REF="110">and vices of the prince, bi&s;hops, beggarly prie&s;ts, or de&s;potic lords of the ca&s;tle; for the Cacoethes <HI>De</HI>-&s;cribendi (if I may be allowed to &s;port with the Latinity) is as &s;trong in &s;ome wandering biographers, as in juvenile poets, when fir&s;t they fancy them&s;elves in love, and pre&s;ent you with that picture of their idols, which imagination has drawn for them. For my&s;elf, and I &s;uppo&s;e others may feel like me on the occa&s;ion, I never, without trembling, ob&s;erve a travelled author <HI>&s;et in</HI> for a long &s;tory of churches, chapels, chateaus, and picture galleries, with a determination to give their "moving accidents" by flood and fire, during the wear and tear, and traditionary lying of half a &s;core centuries. And what, after all, are you pre&s;ented with, but a meagre account, into which the mind and memory of the reader vainly look for &s;omething whereon to re&s;t&mdash;&s;omething more worthy the human faculties, than annals of the intriguing abbots, mi&s;chievous prie&s;ts, and grinding &s;eigniors, buried under their ruins. I venerate antiquity, but mu&s;t have &s;omething that comes clo&s;er to the &s;oul, the under&s;tanding, or the affections, than this collection of literary brickwork, and travelling &s;tone ma&s;onry. Peace to the a&s;hes of the mouldering univer&s;e! Unle&s;s &s;urviving virtues, or immortal actions, lie among&s;t the
<PB N="100" REF="111">ruins, and, like the phoenix, only want an hone&s;t, helping hand to clear away the earthy ob|&s;tructions, to &s;pring above them, I would not re&s;cue an altar, or the canonized bones of a Saint from oblivion. Unembalmed by &s;uch virtues, and &s;uch actions, the du&s;t of a monarch, and the du&s;t of the earth that covers him, is, to me, exactly the &s;ame thing; and as to the relicks of a worthle&s;s being, to what good end could they be brought from the tomb, but as a <HI>maukin</HI> to &s;hew the villains of the pre&s;ent gene|ration, that to &s;uch complexion mu&s;t they come at la&s;t.&mdash;In that light only, have I &s;ome|times, as in the in&s;tance of a John of Leyden, bur&s;t the &s;earments of the grave, and gleaned the coffin of a &s;coundrel.</P>
<P>Re&s;pecting church matters, therefore, I &s;hall certainly not &s;well the li&s;t of hi&s;torians; but, after I have made one general ob&s;ervation, &s;hall content my&s;elf with the relation of a &s;ingle circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>It is really a mo&s;t heart-affecting &s;atisfaction in a circuit of &s;ome hundreds of leagues, &s;uch as I have taken, over different Catholic coun|tries, to &s;ee the decent impre&s;&s;ion that is made on the <HI>pea&s;antry</HI> (which is ever the mo&s;t nu|merous body of a &s;tate by religion. Of the
<PB N="101" REF="112">higher ranks, who lo&s;e their principles and their education too often in the pride of philo|&s;ophy, I &s;hall here &s;ay nothing; but the in|fluence of the Catholic faith on the <HI>&s;ubordinate</HI> ranks is, almo&s;t without an exception, a &s;ober and &s;incere attention to the duties it enjoins. The earne&s;t, yet tempered zeal, with which the common labourer leaves his bu&s;ine&s;s or his plea&s;ure, to commune with his Maker, is among&s;t the comfortable &s;ights that every tra|veller mu&s;t &s;urely have noticed, and noticing mu&s;t have enjoyed. In the plebeian part of the community, at lea&s;t, it mu&s;t be genuine. The infidel philo&s;ophy of the great is, happily, above their reach: the hypocritical mummery or profounder chicane of the yet perhaps more infidel prie&s;thood (I &s;peak of the Catholic churchmen), is &s;till more happily above the under&s;tanding of the pea&s;ant. He can have no views from intere&s;t, from the world's ap|plau&s;e, or from the world's di&s;approbation. His religion, after education has &s;ettled it in his mind, becomes one of the &s;tronge&s;t habits&mdash; it &s;oon ripens into his mo&s;t powerful princi|ples. It is pre&s;ently a voluntary offering, and one of perfect free will, to his God. He accepts its pains and penalties, and never re&s;i&s;ts their infliction. He is told by his confe&s;&s;or of a &s;in, and he &s;uffers for it willingly. Neither does
<PB N="102" REF="113">he perform its duties &s;o mechanically as may be &s;uppo&s;ed&mdash;He goes to the church at all times and &s;ea&s;ons: the gates of the temple are always open, but he is not forced to enter at the &s;tated &s;troke of the pendulum or chime of the bell. If his &s;oul feels not the impul&s;e; if it prefers the &s;acred moment when the hour of public wor&s;hip is pa&s;t, he can withdraw him|&s;elf from the gaze of the world, and conver&s;e, as it were, with his Creator face to face: and in the Catholic churches, which I have <HI>gleaned</HI> even with a &s;u&s;picious vigilance, this is very frequently done, and always with reve|rence. Strangers, drawn by curio&s;ity only, may pa&s;s in groupes from all quarters of the earth, and dre&s;&s;ed in all the different habits of their country, without &s;educing the kneeling Catholic pea&s;ant from his duty: his po&s;ture is unaltered, his prayer unbroken. He rarely lends an ear to conver&s;ation, which is too often irreverently loud, and not often an eye to their per&s;ons.</P>
<P>From this exterior decency, it is fair to infer an internal piety. It is, to be &s;ure, a world replete with &s;ubtle &s;tratagem, and fal&s;e ap|pearances, but if ever there can be &s;uppo&s;ed to be a principle "unmixed with ba&s;er matter," this &s;urely is the mo&s;t free from alloy. And if
<PB N="103" REF="114">one could &s;elect from the ma&s;s of enormities, which the pre&s;ent governors of France have committed, and &s;ingle out an act more foul, more cruel than the re&s;t, I &s;hould not he&s;itate to pronounce their attempt to convert the &s;imple heart to EQUALITY of <HI>Athei&s;m.</HI></P>
<P>The Augean &s;table of the Catholic church, &s;o far as it was connected with politics, no doubt wanted clean&s;ing, and po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome of its mo&s;t a&s;piring heads well de&s;erved <HI>Le Glaive de la Loi,</HI> the &s;word of ju&s;tice, but to my feelings (and it has ari&s;en out of my ob&s;ervation) better, far better, had the convent and the cloi&s;ter been polluted by the whole chicane of the prie&s;thood, than that &s;o many hundreds of thou&s;ands of blamele&s;s beings &s;hould not only want in future the comfort of a refuge in mi&s;ery, and of a guide in happine&s;s, but &s;hould be taught that the benefits and ble&s;&s;ings of the <HI>pa&s;t,</HI> derived from this &s;acred &s;ource, were the trick of a de&s;igning race, and that, for the time to come, the laws of rea&s;on and nature, that is infidelity and licentiou&s;ne&s;s, are to &s;uper|&s;ede tho&s;e of a Saviour and Redeemer of the world. Then, by way of proving their pro&s;e|lyti&s;m and faith in the new creed, they are, in&s;tead of bowing the knee to the cro&s;s, they are to turn from it in mockery, like the re|vilers <PB N="104" REF="115">of old, or to level it with the du&s;t! Glo|rious revolution, and more glorious revolu|tioni&s;ts! To lay the foundations of a republic in human blood, and erect a temple to in|fidelity on the ruins of religion! In the an|cient fabric were there defects? Why not repair them? Mu&s;t it fall that a wor&s;e may be rai&s;ed?&mdash;but I forget my&s;elf&mdash;a &s;courge was wanted in the land, and ye were perhaps the proper in&s;truments to deal de&s;tructions: for who can puni&s;h iniquity like the wicked?</P>
<P>But I promi&s;ed you to clo&s;e with the rela|tion of a circum&s;tance, which I owe to the Catholic church. Half an hour's walking by the &s;ide of the Cleves wood brings you to a little village chapel, who&s;e bell was ringing out for evening ve&s;pers ju&s;t as I paid it my fir&s;t vi&s;it. Only a few of the congregation were then gather'd together. I had therefore time to make an unobtru&s;ive Gleaning. Among&s;t the u&s;ual decorations of pictures, paintings, flowers, and crucifixes, I could not but take notice of the virgin in a chintz-pattern linen gown over a full dre&s;s hoop of immen&s;e circumference; ornamented with three di&s;tinct rows of &s;ilver cro&s;&s;es, the middle row abun|dantly the large&s;t: the crown upon her head was formed of broken beads, and pieces of
<PB N="105" REF="116">looking-gla&s;s: the child Je&s;us held an apple in his hand partly eaten, to expre&s;s what Eve had fraudulently accepted and &s;hared with the devil.</P>
<P>I might have yielded up my gravity at the burle&s;que manner in which this part of &s;acred &s;tory was caricatured, had not the ridicule, it was &s;o well calculated to excite, been checked by my ob&s;erving an old man and woman, two young men, and two female children, kneel|ing with every mark of devotion round the figures. They are of one hou&s;e &s;aid a per&s;on who &s;tood near me, and, in the &s;equel, I found that that hou&s;e had to boa&s;t an holy family. The very moment that I looked upon them, the &s;pirit of mockery died within me; and a much better &s;pirit came upon me in its &s;tead. I had no longer eyes to critici&s;e the figures, nor an heart to break a je&s;t on their ab&s;urdity: As repre&s;entatives of the ble&s;&s;ed virgin and Redeemer of the world, they fill'd me with awe, and I caught &s;o much of unaffected holi|ne&s;s from the&s;e humble &s;uppliants, as to hold &s;acred the coar&s;e&s;t imitations and &s;ymbols of things divine.</P>
<P>It happened to be the <HI>jour de p&acirc;cque,</HI> on the evening of which fe&s;tival there prevails in
<PB N="106" REF="117">We&s;tphalia a cu&s;tom, that I felt was worth gleaning for you and for the public. You &s;hall have it here. The Pru&s;&s;ian pea&s;ants com|memorate the &s;olemn event of our Saviour's re&s;urrection in a &s;ingular manner. In each village of the circle are to be &s;een three or four large bonfires, which the inhabitants have been preparing at their intervals of daily labour during the preceding week. The fires are lighted about nine at night; about ten, when they are in full blaze, the populace, and indeed people of all di&s;tinctions, go out of the Cleves gates to view them. I was lucky enough at the moment to be on a vi&s;it to a gentleman, who, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the we&s;tern Port, had a &s;ummer hou&s;e that commanded the country to the extent of twenty leagues. Every quarter or half league has a village, and the whole twenty leagues were illuminated. It was in it&s;elf an intere&s;t|ing novelty, but when the <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> was contem|plated and combined with it, the heart glow'd like the horizon. In the mid&s;t of the &s;cenery ro&s;e the moon. She was at full, but at the moment of ri&s;ing &s;eem'd another bonfire be|ginning to kindle and a&s;cend. She &s;oon, however, a&s;&s;erted her &s;uperiority, and when &s;he had gain'd her proper &s;tation in the hemi&s;|phere, I could not help repeating to my&s;elf a
<PB N="107" REF="118">few words, applicable to both.&mdash;"Hide your dimini&s;h'd heads", ye feeble works of men's hands: but thou Cynthia art of God. No wonder then at thy lu&s;tre! but, even as I pronounced this, I corrected my ra&s;hne&s;s, my inju&s;tice&mdash;and &s;o are <HI>ye,</HI> ye feeble fires,&mdash;added I,&mdash;of God al&s;o; and every humble &s;park &s;hall a&s;cend to heaven!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXIII. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE already, more than once, in the cour&s;e of this corre&s;pondence, attempted to check the heady current of national preju|dice, which appropriates all that is e&s;timable in human nature to it&s;elf, and leaves to the re&s;t of the world only its vices, vanities, and in|&s;ignificancies. I have given many examples of urbanity, that have been the growth of &s;oils le&s;s celebrated than that of Britain, or than what once was France. I have &s;hewn it flou|ri&s;hing even in the unwhole&s;ome clime of Holland. Let me now offer you an in&s;tance of its blooming power in We&s;tphalia. In truth it is a flower appropriate to no particular country, but will pro&s;per wherever it is duly
<PB N="108" REF="119">cultivated. Its natural &s;oil is the human heart, in which it &s;prings up, and thrives, very &s;oon after that heart begins to beat, and would continue till there is no longer motion, were not pa&s;&s;ions and prejudices for ever at work to check its growth or kill it in the hud.</P>
<P>In one of the mo&s;t profound rece&s;&s;es of this beautiful country, at the di&s;tance of at lea&s;t forty leagues from a court, thirty from a city, and at lea&s;t ten miles from a market town. I once found urbanity that would have given lu&s;tre to them all. I found her in a cottage of clay, at the foot of a Pru&s;&s;ian fore&s;t, under covert of which I was &s;haded from ob&s;erva|tion. It was on one of the mo&s;t lovely even|ings a wanderer like my&s;elf could have de|fir'd, and according to my emigrant di&s;po|&s;ition, I had enjoyed it from the upri&s;e even to the down-going of the &s;un. The &s;un indeed of that di&s;tingui&s;h'd day was making a "golden &s;et" ju&s;t as I reach'd the precincts of the wood, where I had not repos'd many minutes, ere I heard the &s;ound of a flute, ac|companied by a voice who&s;e natural &s;weetne&s;s excelled it in melody. The notes were indeed a&s;&s;i&s;ted by many harmonizing circum&s;tances. You who are a lover of nature, know what a
<PB N="109" REF="120">variety of &s;oothing &s;ounds pervade the air at eventide in the &s;ummer.&mdash;The pure breath of the zephir, the di&s;tant rivulet, that &s;eems, by its indolent lap&s;e, and &s;ubdued murmur, to partake of human &s;en&s;ations,&mdash;the drow&s;y hum of the beetle, which the poet has im|mortaliz'd, and the general &s;ighing of the leaves, with, perhaps, the horn of the herd|boy, and the lowing of his cattle obedient to his &s;ummons&mdash;and above all, tho&s;e founds which imagination her&s;elf <HI>creates</HI>&mdash;all the&s;e contribute to form that twilight enchantment, which a tender heart, and a benevolent di&s;|po&s;ition &s;o much delights in; and which, men of the world con&s;ider as the day-dreams of madmen.</P>
<P>Had I time to &s;pare from my cottagers, it would be amu&s;ing to run at &s;ome length the parallel betwixt a lover of nature and a man of the world, and to examine the e&s;timate that each makes of the objects a&s;&s;embled in the la&s;t pa&s;&s;age. To attempt this in abridge|ment&mdash;</P>
<P>1&s;t. The man of the world, would never be tempted to leave the "chearful haunts of men" without what is called a jolly party: five out of the &s;ix of which probably wi&s;h|ing <PB N="110" REF="121">them&s;elves as many different ways before half the day is over, and, at la&s;t, going yawn|ing home thoroughly tired with if not hating one another: for I have &s;o often ob&s;erv'd a party of plea&s;ure to be &s;o painful a plot upon the members that compo&s;e it, that were I to com|pile a new Dictionary, in which definitions were hone&s;tly to be given, I &s;hould under the words <HI>party of plea&s;ure,</HI> inform the reader that it is meant to &s;ignify, <HI>the a&s;&s;ociation of a &s;et of per&s;ons met together with ta&s;tes and tempers frequently di&s;cordant, and intere&s;ts in oppo&s;ition, yet determined to congregate, for the purpo&s;e of tea&s;ing one another under the ma&s;k of &s;ocial good|fellow&s;hip; which ma&s;k generally drops, or is torn off in the cour&s;e of a few hours to the di&s;covery of the whole con&s;piracy.</HI>&mdash;Such is the mere man of the world's party of plea&s;ure: yes, and woman's of the world al&s;o!</P>
<P>2nd. A man of the world has no concep|tion of the breath or &s;ounds <HI>of,</HI>&mdash;or <HI>in</HI> the air, in the way that a lover of nature feels and en|joys them. A man of the world indeed ob|&s;erves that it is cur&s;ed hot, and throws up the &s;a&s;hes, or cur&s;ed cold, and pulls down the blinds,&mdash;the inflammatory bottles, ten times more burning than the &s;un-beams, are &s;till on the table,&mdash;yet, at the fa&s;hionable hour he

The play among&s;t the card veterans, becomes too inten&s;e for ob&s;erving on any &s;tratagems but their own: the card pa&s;&s;ions are all at work, breaking the unlucky chairs of &s;ome, biting the lips, gna&s;hing the teeth, &s;lap|ping the foreheads, or &s;tamping the feet of others, and while the <HI>honours</HI> are lo&s;t by one, and the <HI>odd trick</HI> gained by another, the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e &s;laves in ho&s;pitality, and &s;truggles through the elegant mob, with more toil and difficulty, than a landlady at an election dinner!</P>

The &s;ong and mu&s;ic proceeded, mingled with dancing, of which I could rather hear the happy &s;tep, than perceive the enlivening figure.

<P>As the fir&s;t day of the Carme was &s;olemnizing while I was at the village chapel, &s;o that on which I entered this woodland habitation was the la&s;t of that fe&s;tival; and this pea&s;ant family were then celebrating it. Religion, therefore, no le&s;s than ho&s;pitality, and both under guid|ance of &s;incerity, invited me to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the felicity. Every &s;imple delicacy of fruit and flower, was in an in&s;tant placed before me. Their di&s;cour&s;e was &s;o provincial, that pro|bably a German citizen of Cleves, might have found a difficulty to decypher it. But the language of bounty, like that of love is univer&s;al:
<Q>"All heads can reach it, and all hearts conceive."</Q> It is the volume of nature; one of its faire&s;t pages was &s;pread open. Had I run I could have read it; and, believe me, my generous friend, it exhibited in&s;truction well worth the ob&s;ervance of tho&s;e who live in prouder dwell|ings. I found here no broad, coar&s;e ridicule at my ignorance; none at my intru&s;ion. I was a &s;tranger within the gate, but I received the
<PB N="116" REF="127">welcome of a friend. I di&s;covered no wi&s;h to know from whence I came, or whither I was going, &s;ave a &s;hort expre&s;&s;ed a&s;&s;urance, that when I, my&s;elf, found it proper for me to depart, I might be &s;ure of being put into the right way. A very old man and woman, a labourer, who was the mu&s;ician, the youth and maiden whom I have before mentioned, and three more couple of lads and la&s;&s;es, formed the a&s;&s;embly. Soon after my entrance, every body &s;ound &s;omething to do for me expre&s;|&s;ive of good-will. The aged man gave up his ru&s;h arm chair, and in&s;i&s;ted on my occupying it; the matron, his wife, contributed a cu&s;hion from a wicker one that &s;tood oppo&s;ite; the elde&s;t daughter, &s;till in a dancing &s;tep, (the carriage of the lighte&s;t articles di&s;puted by her attendant youth, in his dancing mea&s;ures al&s;o) brought to the table and &s;pread on it a cloth, white even as her apparent innocency. Another pre&s;ented me with a bowl of new milk, ano|ther with fruits, another came bounding in with flowers, moi&s;tened by the evening dew|drop. Bread, butter, and &s;lices of ham, were added to the banquet, and when I had nothing left to be done for me, my entertainers did not &s;tand, like many, even Briti&s;h ru&s;tics, &s;o taken by &s;urprize, to &s;tare me out of appetite, and with wide opened mouths, as if they could
<PB N="117" REF="128">them&s;elves &s;wallow all that they had &s;et before me; but wi&s;hing me good appetite re&s;umed their fe&s;tivities. Never was the banquet of a monarch more harmonious&mdash;&s;eldom &s;o di&s;in|tere&s;tedly; but all at once I mi&s;&s;ed the mu&s;ician, and one of the dancers &s;upplied his place, the old man nodded time with his head, then beat it with his &s;tick, and the matron accompanied with her foot. Time flew in&s;en|&s;ibly&mdash;the &s;un was in an other hemi&s;phere&mdash;the moon &s;et&mdash;the &s;tars became clouded, and the combining influence of the&s;e &s;everal circum|&s;tances forced on me the con&s;ideration, then fir&s;t remembered, that I was a benighted gleaner, &s;everal leagues from the town, whence I had wandered by innumerable cro&s;s paths, ju&s;t as fancy had carried me. The good people read my embarra&s;&s;ment, and cha&s;ed it away by fre&s;h dances, &s;ongs, and mu&s;ic; in the mid&s;t of which, up ro&s;e the veteran, and with an air of gallantry giving his hand to the aged dame, who had literally been his partner for eight and fifty years, hobbled an alamande, with much more agility than could have been expected. He then run into a dance, which they call <HI>Schleifern,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting &s;imply in two per&s;ons of either &s;ex, taking hold of each other's dre&s;s behind, and moving in a circle to &s;low mu&s;ic: a way-lo&s;t man, in a &s;tormy night
<PB N="118" REF="129">upon an heath, would have forgot his condition while this dance was performing, had he re|flected on the occa&s;ion of it, which was a genuine effu&s;ion of ho&s;pitality to man, and gratitude to God. The young folks became almo&s;t wild with plea&s;ure, and &s;truck into many artle&s;s gaities, till they encircled the old ones in a kind of &s;pontaneous dance which gradually contracted the circle, &s;o that in the end they had the aged couple clo&s;ed within their arms. Every one pre&s;ent formed a part of the love-knot, and had &s;hare of the embrace. It was one of the prettie&s;t impromptu's of gaity and affection I ever beheld; and I repeat, that a traveller who had unknown leagues at midnight to mea&s;ure back without a guide, mu&s;t have forgot his fears. When the frolic was over, the good veteran led his ancient dame back to her chair, with the &s;ame courte&s;y and natural grace he had conducted her from it, and as &s;he &s;at down, there was a tran&s;itory glow in her cheeks, which exerci&s;e and felicity had called into them. It was a momentary renovation of her youthful days, in which &s;he mu&s;t have been extremely hand&s;ome; for time that had robbed her of the colourings, had committed le&s;s violent ravage on the propor|tions of her beauty. Her hu&s;band looked at <HI>her</HI> with affection, and then at the company
<PB N="119" REF="130">with &s;ome little elevation of &s;elf-love, at the feats he had performed.</P>
<P>Before the&s;e animating trifles (of great figure in dome&s;tic happine&s;s) had time to grow cold, the original mu&s;ician, whom I told you was the labourer, returned introducing an old &s;oldier, who &s;aluted me, at fir&s;t &s;ight, in excellent French, which almo&s;t in the next in&s;tant, he tran&s;lated into very interpretable, though un|grammatical Engli&s;h. He lo&s;t no time in tell|ing me, that the cottager had fetched him from an hou&s;e where he had been pa&s;&s;ing part of the Carme, above a league's di&s;tance, for no other rea&s;on than to conduct me back to the place from whence I came; promi&s;ing me at the &s;ame time, &s;aid the &s;oldier, a &s;uitable reward for my trouble, but that I &s;hall not accept of, &s;eeing I have the honour, Sir, to be your countryman.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, my friend, awhile, the unbought, nay, un&s;ollicited ho&s;pitality of this groupe of poor pea&s;ants&mdash;take a retro&s;pect of their be|haviour&mdash;fini&s;h the picture by &s;uppo&s;ing you &s;ee the old man and his wife, <HI>thanking me</HI> for the plea&s;ure they had in entertaining me: fail not to paint on the canva&s;s the old &s;oldier, offering him&s;elf to me as a voluntary guide,
<PB N="120" REF="131">in ca&s;e I &s;hould per&s;i&s;t in refu&s;ing the bed, which both the aged and the young would have yielded to me; then, on &s;etting out, under favour of the ri&s;ing moon, let your imagina|tion give form and figure to the whole groupe of youths and maidens, attending me part of the way, &s;till dancing, while the hone&s;t min&s;trel labourer compleated the midnight &s;erenade! And the whole was performed with &s;o much &s;port, glee, and goodwill, to the &s;ounds of which a thou&s;and woodland echoes re&s;ponded, that the verie&s;t mi&s;anthrope would have been converted into a lover of mankind. I do pro|te&s;t to you, I never felt my pul&s;es vibrate with more enthu&s;ia&s;m. It was with difficulty I forced upon the mu&s;ical labourer, a &s;mall pre|&s;ent, or rather payment, for fetching the &s;oldier; and when all but the la&s;t left me, a &s;entiment of regret &s;truck my bo&s;om, and grew more and more comfortle&s;s, as the &s;ound of their retreat|ing foot&s;teps and voices dimini&s;hed on my ear, and when even on &s;tanding a moment to li&s;ten&mdash; a pau&s;e to which my grateful heart impelled me&mdash;they could be heard no more, the &s;en&s;a|tion &s;welled almo&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>The &s;oldier &s;eemed to feel a &s;ort of &s;ympa|thy, and amu&s;ed the way with the adventures of his life. They did not, however, begin to in|tere&s;t <PB N="121" REF="132">me &s;o &s;oon as they might have done, had they been related at any other &s;ea&s;on. He told me, however, that he had lived &s;o many years out of his native country, that he had almo&s;t forgot his mother tongue, as you may perceive, Sir, &s;aid he, by my bad Engli&s;h. He added, that he had &s;erved his late Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, the grand Frederick, almo&s;t &s;even and thirty years, and had the honour to have been &s;hot in almo&s;t every battle, and part of the human body; but was &s;till as heart-whole, and care-free, as any man in the circle of We&s;tphalia. The Grand Frederick, Sir, continued he, has &s;ettled upon me a little pen&s;ion, and given me a &s;nug apart|ment in the Chateau of Cleves, where, &s;hould your honour deign to come, I have always a gla&s;s of good Rheni&s;h, to offer an Engli&s;hman, aye, and any other hone&s;t man; and where, if your honour plea&s;es, we will drink the kings of England and Pru&s;&s;ia, (for they now happen to be good friends, you know) in a bumper, be|fore we get into bed! Thus ended my little jubilee, to the infinite content of my heart; and, I tru&s;t of your's: At lea&s;t, I can wi&s;h you no greater good than that each of your future days may be crowned like this; and that your after &s;lumbers may be as &s;weet!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXIV. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>THE weekly vi&s;itation of the begging friars, and Sunday a&s;&s;emblies, are among&s;t the things which &s;hould be recommended to the notice of tho&s;e who go into We&s;tphalia, being both really curious in their kind.</P>
<P>In regard to the fir&s;t, it is an invariable rule for one or other of the mendicant brothers to make the tour of the town in, or near which, his convent is &s;ituated. Sanctioned by the cu&s;tom of his country, he gains admittance into every hou&s;e, whether public or private, and is "happy to catch you ju&s;t at dinner-time." He moves round the table with his little box, into which every one puts, or appears to put, &s;omething, but evidently more as a thing of cour&s;e than charity. He neither &s;peaks, nor is &s;poken to: he glides almo&s;t unheard, and un&s;een, behind your chair, and having fini&s;hed his collections, which are probably &s;canty enough, he bows off as he bowed on.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="134">The &s;econd circum&s;tance, viz. the Sunday evening card route, is full as &s;ingular, but by no means &s;o &s;ilent. It is compo&s;ed of thirty and forty (frequently more) of the mo&s;t re|&s;pectable per&s;ons of the town, who, after the devotions of the &s;abbath, which they perform with great exactne&s;s, almo&s;t, indeed, to rigour, a&s;&s;emble at the be&s;t inn, and pa&s;s the evening partly over a pack of cards, and partly over a good &s;upper. The la&s;t time I was at the city of Cleves, where I have now in fancy &s;et you down, I was an eye-witne&s;s to this &s;upplement to the Sunday duties, there being, at that time, no le&s;s than &s;even tables, well furni&s;hed with preparations for the nocturnal a&s;&s;ociation. Tra|vellers of any decent appearance are always welcome. There is never any thing like a debauch, and the company &s;eparate about twelve. The &s;ingularity of all this con&s;i&s;ts only in its oppo&s;ition to our <HI>modes</HI> of doing the &s;ame thing in Great Britain; and we may truly &s;ay the matter is more elegantly conducted in London. Would it not be thought very odd for the nobility and gentry of both &s;exes, and of the fir&s;t character, to meet at a tavern in that great city, where, the moment a lady made her appearance, a &s;tove full of hot coals was placed under her petticoats, and, on the en|trance <PB N="124" REF="135">of each man of fa&s;hion, an immen&s;e pipe with a &s;pitting box?</P>
<P>How often, in the traver&s;e of different coun|tries, has a traveller occa&s;ion to exclaim, with the poet,
<Q>"I &s;ee full plainly cu&s;tom forms us all!"</Q> And, in truth, it requires the &s;tronge&s;t power of our habits to reconcile us to &s;ome things that will ri&s;e up in our way as we journey along.</P>
<P>Among&s;t other <HI>preparations,</HI> with which my zeal has armed you, let me not omit to be&s;eech that you will make up your mind to the <HI>dirty</HI> doings of We&s;tphalian Pru&s;&s;ia, and, indeed, in certain ca&s;es, of the whole Germanic empire. I have, in a former letter, invited your ob&s;er|vation to a comparative view of the countries of Holland and Pru&s;&s;ia, in re&s;pect of the gra|dual relief which the eye receives from the fa|tiguing uniformity of the one to the ri&s;ing diver&s;ities of the other; but this is not the only matter that awaits your attention, O ye readers of this hi&s;tory, and ye &s;ojourners in this land. Would ye &s;ee placed before you one of the mo&s;t &s;triking contra&s;ts in the world, behold it in the general neatne&s;s of the Hollander, and almo&s;t univer&s;al filth of the Pru&s;&s;ian and German.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="136">It is impo&s;&s;ible for an Engli&s;hman, who&s;e eyes are, by no means, unaccu&s;tomed to the decencies of life, in his own country, to with|hold the tribute of his admiration on the pecu|liar niceties of the towns, within and without, from his fir&s;t landing in Holland to his taking leave of its Seven Provinces. The door|ways, the pa&s;&s;ages, the windows, the inner apartments, the kitchen, the very lumber|rooms (where, by the bye, every &s;tick, board, and other unoccupied thing, is laid in a pictu|re&s;que manner, as if by the hand of &s;ymmetry) the warehou&s;es, where indu&s;try is for ever at hard, and very often at dirty work; the very out-hou&s;es, which frequently connect with the general &s;itting-room, and in which, perhaps, twenty cows are &s;talled on the one &s;ide, and as many hor&s;es &s;tabled on the other, and in which all &s;orts of dome&s;tic fowls, nay, where not &s;eldom the very pigs are nouri&s;hed; each and all of the&s;e places are kept in &s;uch order, di&s;|po&s;ed in &s;uch arrangement, and with &s;uch uniform cleanline&s;s, that, whether it proceeds from the nece&s;&s;ity of the climate, in regard to the influence which its humidity otherwi&s;e might have upon the health, or whether from a principle, or only an habit of neatne&s;s, it is certainly a charming cu&s;tom,
<Q>"More honour'd in the ob&s;ervance than the breach."</Q>
<PB N="106" REF="137">But the offen&s;ive rever&s;e is forced upon you, almo&s;t immediately on your quitting the con|fines of the Stadtholder. The di&s;gu&s;ting con|tra&s;t will &s;trike you in <HI>almo&s;t every particular,</HI> &s;o that if you plea&s;e to re-peru&s;e the li&s;t of the items above &s;tated, taking their oppo&s;ite, that is, reading dirty for clean, as you go on, you will have before you a picture of Dutch nicety and Pru&s;&s;ian na&s;tine&s;s.</P>
<P>And the remark is to be extended to per&s;ons as well as things. Notwith&s;tanding the ince&s;|&s;ant toil, which an unremitting attention to neatne&s;s in a flat, foggy country, mu&s;t occa&s;ion, there is, in the mid&s;t of their labours, an air of <HI>propret&eacute;.</HI> The common &s;ervants, even in their drudgery, are always to be &s;een with clean &s;tockings, which are always &s;hewn to the middle of the leg, &s;lippers, which, notwith&s;tanding the violent motion of the mop and pail, hang on the foot as if by magic, and head dre&s;&s;es which are oftener &s;een without hat or bonnet, be the weather what it may. Whereas, in the neighbouring countries, the hou&s;es are more <HI>mal propre</HI> than the &s;tables of Holland, and the Sunday apparel of the common people (females more e&s;pecially) is wor&s;e got up, and wor&s;e put on, than the Saturday night working|dre&s;&s;es of the Dutch pea&s;antry.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="138">In your peru&s;al of this and every other &s;imilar account, I mu&s;t once again warn you that I confine my&s;elf principally to the inns, hotels, and other public places, to which a traveller mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity, fir&s;t repair, or to tho&s;e private lodgings, which, if he makes any &s;top, are u&s;ually his &s;econd movement. But it may be received as a general rule, that if all the&s;e places are in one country neat, inviting and regular, and in another utterly different, it is fair and candid to draw this inference, that dirt is the general characteri&s;tic of the one country, and cleanline&s;s, of the other. Certain it is I have &s;een regularity, elegance, and delicacy, in the circle of We&s;tphalia; and I have al&s;o witne&s;&s;ed the rever&s;e of the&s;e in Holland: but the&s;e can be con&s;idered only as exceptions to the general rule.</P>
<P>No human being is more aware than your&s;elf, my dear friend, that there are certain <HI>decencies</HI> in civil &s;ociety, which are always very charming, and in certain ca&s;es, not a little embarra&s;&s;ing; but without the adroit performance of which human nature, in &s;ome of its highe&s;t luxuries, no le&s;s than in &s;everal of its lowe&s;t nece&s;&s;ities, is but a very dirty piece of bu&s;ine&s;s. Among&s;t the&s;e decencies is one, concerning which an Engli&s;h traveller not yet a&s;&s;imilated to the man|ners <PB N="128" REF="139">of other countries, and retaining, and ever wi&s;hing to retain a re&s;pect for the decorums of his own, is at a lo&s;s how to write; particularly when tho&s;e writings will, probably, come under the eyes of his delicate countrywomen. Yet, a little adventure on this <HI>tickli&s;h</HI> &s;ubject met me on the way, &s;o extremely characteri&s;tic of the manners of, at lea&s;t, one half of the civilized globe, and &s;o extremely <HI>un</HI>-character|i&s;tic of one comfortable corner of the earth, where the <HI>per&s;onal delicacies,</HI> if not the Graces, have taken up their abode, that I cannot in fair de&s;cription help going over this <HI>trembling ground</HI> to give you its Gleanings. Now Yorick would have made no difficulty on this occa&s;ion. He could, you know, reconcile his readers to whatever matter he thought proper to &s;et before them; but as I, by no means, po&s;&s;e&s;s the magic of that illu&s;trious traveller, I do not feel my|&s;elf entitled to the indulgences which &s;uch magic claims, and &s;hall, therefore, not pre&s;ume to take the &s;ame liberties.</P>
<P>In a certain fair di&s;trict then, within and but ju&s;t within the circle of We&s;tphalia, there &s;tands a plea&s;ant and very con&s;iderable town, &s;ituated on the banks of the Lower Rhine, y'clept Emerick. Its extreme beauty excited in me a fir&s;t &s;ight wi&s;h to make a &s;top of
<PB N="129" REF="140">&s;ome weeks; and being arrived ju&s;t at that period of life, when the comfort of a good night's re&s;t in a good bed is con&s;idered as one of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, in however tumultuary a manner one pa&s;&s;es the day, I preferred private to public lodgings: and, accordingly, after due refre&s;hment, went out in &s;earch of them. My broken German dialect &s;tood me in good &s;tead on this occa&s;ion. I &s;oon &s;aw a lodging bill, and knocked at the door, but the ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s of it being from home, I had to blunder out my meaning to four dome&s;tics, who I fancy babbled a jargon le&s;s intelligible than my own; though no country could appropriate it, it was a mixture of all, but the proportions of the compound went more to Dutch, Cleves|land, and German, than to any other language. In this patois they gave me to under&s;tand as well as they could, that the heads of the hou&s;e being ab&s;ent, nothing could be done till their return on the morrow. I was, by convention with a party of acquaintance, to &s;leep that night at the di&s;tance of two leagues, and left the hou&s;e without any favourable prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, re&s;olving to take a future opportunity to look for other lodgings. But judge of my &s;urprize when the lord of this unpromi&s;ing habitation made his appearance in my chamber, before I had ri&s;en, the next morning, to a&s;&s;ure me he
<PB N="130" REF="141">was in de&s;pair at my di&s;appointment in not &s;ee|ing his apartments, which he prote&s;ted to God were the mo&s;t plea&s;ant, mo&s;t airy, and mo&s;t beautiful of any in the We&s;tphalian circle, and he verily believed in the German territory. Then en&s;ued the following que&s;tion and an&s;wer conver&s;ation, which I will endeavour to render intelligible without a <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> or <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> to the irk&s;ome repetition of which I have as mortal an objection as Marmontel him&s;elf: Would I could as happily prove it expletive! Are the&s;e apartments well furni&s;hed?&mdash;Delightfully in every part of them.&mdash;Then I wi&s;h my little temporary menage to be &s;ometimes at home: is this po&s;&s;ible?&mdash;Every earthly convenience, Sir.&mdash;Perhaps, then, I might now and then dine <HI>en famille?</HI>&mdash;Nothing &s;o ea&s;y.&mdash;You have, no doubt, a proper table?&mdash;I only wi&s;h you would do me the honour to come and judge for your&s;elf: I honour the Engli&s;h, and live very much in the Engli&s;h fa&s;hion: ROST BIF on the table every Sunday.&mdash;It were needle&s;s then to a&s;k if you can give me a good bed?&mdash;The be&s;t and &s;ofte&s;t in the circle&mdash;that's all.&mdash;Indeed, then they need not be better.&mdash;No, truly, and I have had &s;uch lodgers to lie upon them; No le&s;s than the flower of the nobility of all nations&mdash;Le Comte de A&mdash;, la Comte&s;&s;e de B&mdash;, Madame la Duche&s;&s;e de C&mdash;, the duke
<PB N="131" REF="142">of D&mdash;, the earl of E&mdash;, bi&s;hop F&mdash;, barone&s;s G&mdash;, and a &s;tring of the fir&s;t titles, all the way to Z.</P>
<P>As the man ran through the&s;e illu&s;trious in&s;|tials, in alphabetical order, I beg'd to know if he was indulging him&s;elf in a laugh upon that &s;tale trick of travellers, the a&s;&s;uming fal&s;e titles while they were making the grand tour,&mdash;and, if &s;o, the &s;atire was well enough directed again&s;t &s;uch a pettifogging ambition, which, however, was pretty well puni&s;h'd al|ready, as the&s;e fictitious <HI>grandenrs</HI> are gene|rally charg'd in every bill upon the road.&mdash; Laugh! no, I never was more &s;erious as to the whole alphabet of great folks having at different times occupied my apartments, although they did not happen to come into them in the exact Dictionary form, and order afore&s;aid: And as to a travelling title, while a lady or gentleman pays up to the price of nobility, there is no que&s;tion but &s;he, or he, are right noble, and honourable.</P>
<P>Although I now perceived there was a &s;pice of the wag in mine ho&s;t, I began to think there might be &s;ome part of his hou&s;e, which did not at fir&s;t &s;trike the view, and which might &s;purn all &s;ort of connexion with
<PB N="132" REF="143">the mi&s;erable &s;hop at the door of which I had entered: In &s;hort, I now fear'd that in&s;tead of finding the man&s;ion too bad, I &s;hould find it for a quiet, ob&s;erving, and unob&s;erv'd Gleaner too good. With that kind of alteration of air and tone therefore, which an hone&s;t and well-temper'd man glides into, when he &s;up|po&s;es he has undervalued any thing by an overha&s;ty judgment, I informed the ma&s;ter, that I was apprehen&s;ive his rooms would be too &s;pacious and &s;plendid for my purpo&s;e,&mdash; that I was by no means any one of the &s;uperb per&s;onages of his alphabet, but &s;imply an Engli&s;hman in pur&s;uit of health, and the pure air and water which &s;o greatly contribute to them; but for which I could not afford to pay too dear a price.</P>
<P>By no means too dear, you will have them, &s;ir, in a manner for nothing&mdash;and as for air and water, I &s;ay nothing&mdash;vous verrez&mdash; I wont &s;ay any thing&mdash;not a &s;yllable&mdash;perdie, yous verrez&mdash;you will &s;ee.&mdash;I do not &s;uppo&s;e there is &s;uch air in the heavens, nor &s;uch water under them&mdash;vous verrez&mdash;that's all.</P>
<P>Then you may expect me at Emerick the next morning.&mdash;I kept my word. Mine ho&s;t was &s;tanding in expectation at his door; and
<PB N="133" REF="144">&s;carce gave me time to &s;peak, before he ran with me through the &s;hop before commemo|rated, and which after all was the only way of entrance. Then he took me into a poor, white-wa&s;h'd, brick bottom'd, rough pav'd back room, with one window, opening to the Rhine, but &s;o loaded with iron bars without, and &s;o guarded by a net work of ru&s;ty wire, that you could only get a peep at the river <HI>au traver&s;e.</HI> Then recommenc'd the Dialogue, there's an apartment for you &s;ir,&mdash;there's a &s;alle &s;uperbe &agrave; manger, ou pour voir le monde,&mdash; yes, there's a noble dining-room, or to receive company.</P>
<P>Not allowing me a moment's time to reply, he da&s;h'd with me into a &s;ort of kitchen at the back of this &s;uperbe Salle, and throwing open a door at one end of it, bade me take care of my head, which was a very nece&s;&s;ary cau|tion, the doorway making it convenient to &s;ave that head from being broke by doubling the re&s;t of the body. He mounted a ladder, and taking my hand, hawl'd me after him. Up we both went as ab&s;olute a perpendicular, of near forty &s;tairs, as ever led to the main|ma&s;t head of a fir&s;t rate man of war. I do a&s;&s;ure you, the &s;trong wing of a pigeon would have required a little breathing as it a&s;cended.
<PB N="134" REF="145">My landlord allow'd of none, but kept ex|claiming&mdash;now, now we &s;hall come to a char|mante Kamer,&mdash;a charming chamber.&mdash;At the end of our clambering we reach'd a room that had neither bed, chair, or gla&s;s; I was about to expre&s;s my &s;urprize at this, when, anxious to &s;hew me all his lions, my hurry &s;curry guide hurried me to a <HI>very little apartment indeed,</HI> the door of which he was proceeding to open with his accu&s;tomed rapidity, when a voice from within exclaimed in a tranquilliz'd tone.&mdash; Arr&ecirc;te un petit moment s'il vous plait Mon|fieur.

<P>Here he pointed to another outlet, where, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I &s;hould never have thought of looking for a pro&s;pect;&mdash;But the ma&s;ter of the man&s;ion ab&s;olutely piqued him&s;elf upon it.&mdash; There &s;ir, what do you think of that!&mdash;In your very bed chamber&mdash;almo&s;t within reach of your bed, Mon&s;ieur,&mdash;there's comfort,&mdash; there's recommendation!&mdash;A&s;&s;urement bien commode, &s;aid the young lady, joining in the conver&s;ation with all the ea&s;e in the world.&mdash; Indeed &s;he had left the door open on her coming out, purely with a de&s;ign to a&s;&s;i&s;t the great character her friend and relation, as I afterwards under&s;tood he was, had given it.&mdash;The man concluded his eulogy by again intreating to know what I thought of it? Hereupon, I ob&s;erved to him, that though I could not &s;ay they &s;ettle the&s;e matters <HI>better</HI> in We&s;tphalia than in England, yet they do &s;ettle them in the former place much more at their <HI>ea&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The lady had ju&s;t left the room, &s;o that my an&s;wer was addre&s;&s;ed only to my officious groom of the chamber, who was extremely &s;urpri&s;ed,
<PB N="136" REF="147">when I told him that the little adventure of the little lady in the little apartment could never gain credit, were I to relate it in my country; nay, could never have happened in any decent part of the kingdom of England, except by an accident, which would have covered even a girl of ten years old with con|fu&s;ion, and made a female of maturer age a&s;hamed to lift her eye to the di&s;coverer, if he happened to be a man, for &s;ome days after: I added, that the &s;en&s;e of decency was &s;o nice in my country, that very &s;erious illne&s;&s;es had &s;ometimes been incurred from the dread of &s;ome &s;uch expo&s;ure. Ma foi, cela e&s;t bien bi&s;arre: i'faith that's whim&s;ical enough, &s;aid the man.&mdash;He then &s;hewed off the re&s;t of his hou&s;e in the &s;ame inflated &s;tyle of panegyric. And pray where are the &s;uperb beds? They may be had &s;ir in a month, and I might have the beautiful &s;alle below, and the charming chamber above, and the delicious apartment thereunto belonging, for &s;o very trifling a &s;um as &s;even hundred florins a year, and my diet for &s;even hundred more. The enormity of the demand, being no le&s;s a &s;um than would pur|cha&s;e the fee-&s;imple of the whole hou&s;e, &s;hop, and little apartment into the bargain, brought our di&s;cour&s;e to a &s;hort conclu&s;ion. I could not but feel it as an in&s;ult levell'd at his
<PB N="137" REF="148">opinion of Engli&s;h folly, and left his hou&s;e with telling him, I was &s;orry we had taken up &s;o much of each other's time to &s;o little pur|po&s;e. He &s;eemed to think &s;o too, and drop|ping his vivacity and his courte&s;y at once, &s;uffer'd me to depart even without a bow.

<HEAD>LETTER LXV. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>IN our fir&s;t &s;heaf I collected for you a Gleaning of the village &s;uper&s;titions of Wales. I will now offer you tho&s;e of Germany, e&s;pe|cially in the country of Juliers, Le Mark, &amp;c. bordering on We&s;tphalia. The country people of tho&s;e places have the mo&s;t &s;olemn faith in &s;orceries and witches, who though in their proper &s;hape are only a pack of very old women, can a&s;&s;ume any form, either be&s;tial or human; but are, it &s;eems, mo&s;t fond of appear|ing in the character of cats. Some of this witchery is carried to &s;uch exce&s;s, that many people in the country of Juliers will on no con&s;ideration intermarry with a per&s;on, who may be &s;uppo&s;ed of having a &s;orcerer's blood in his veins; nay, the mo&s;t advantageous matches have been refu&s;ed, and the attractions of love it&s;elf been re&s;i&s;ted, rather than a daughter &s;hould go to the arms of a man who has ever had a witch in his family, and the geneological tree was never more cautiou&s;ly examined, and traced by a birth-proud noble to e&s;cape the di&s;grace of pollution, than it is to avoid an alliance with a &s;orcerer or &s;orcere&s;s. If there
<PB N="140" REF="151">can be found in the hi&s;tory of twenty genera|tions, only twigs &s;ufficient to make up one hereditary be&s;om, or broom&s;tic, on which the witch by de&s;cent might hor&s;e two of her &s;ingers; not only the &s;huddering parent, but the tremb|ling lover, would con&s;ider it as &s;trong a bar to his marriage, as if his mi&s;tre&s;s had been taken in ince&s;t.</P>
<P>They believe al&s;o in loup-garou's, or men|wolves; a gentleman of the fir&s;t character here for learning and integrity, but who, unhappily for his country, is now no more, (Mr. Bauman, of the Privy Council of Cleves, and fir&s;t pa&s;tor of the reformed church,) related to me the &s;tory of a man at Cologne who a&s;&s;umed the character of a loup-garou, and who lived by the pillage of whatever in that character he could lay his hands on for many years, in&s;o|much that he had ama&s;&s;ed great wealth, as well in money as valuable moveables; but he was at la&s;t a&s;&s;aulted and taken, by a country man who &s;wore he defied the devil and all his works, and who had been long marked with a general op|probrium for this daring di&s;belief of evil &s;pirits. This man was encountered by the loup-garou, on the day he was known to have &s;old a quan|tity of corn at the Cologne market, and to have received the money; but &s;o far was he from
<PB N="141" REF="152">tamely yielding up his hone&s;t profits to either man or bea&s;t, that in&s;tead of flying with terror before the wolf-man, or dropping his money|bag; he held the &s;aid bag at the extent of his arm, which was a powerful one, and felled the thief to the earth, with that very gold and &s;ilver which he would have purloined. When he &s;omewhat recovered the blow, our heroic farmer threw him like a &s;tunned calf over his hor&s;e, even in his wolves cloathing, and de|livered him over to the magi&s;trate, who, after the due cour&s;e of law, ordered him to be hanged in his loup-garou dre&s;s, in the public market-place of Cologne. One would have thought this di&s;a&s;ter would have opened the eyes of &s;uper&s;tition; but, alas, eyes hath &s;he, and &s;eeth not! Neither are her votaries to be driven from the &s;teadfa&s;t faith that was in them by the detection of a &s;ingle impo&s;tor. On the contrary the Colognians believe, at lea&s;t they have a tradition at this day, that the real loup|garou, being angry with the man that was hanged, got into him, and in order to be revenged, put it into the head of the farmer, that he might be taken up as a thief, and come to an untimely end; but that the in&s;tant the halter was round the pretender's neck, the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of the real wolf-man &s;lipped out of him again, and enjoyed his triumph, to think how
<PB N="142" REF="153">cleverly he had brought his enemy to the gal|lows. Thus the very circum&s;tances that ought to weaken &s;uper&s;ution give it &s;trength.</P>
<P>Their credulity embraces al&s;o feveral other imaginary beings, particularly of the fairy tribe. The&s;e, however, differ from our's in &s;ome of their manners and cu&s;toms. They are of the &s;ame &s;pecies, but inhabitants of a dif|ferent country, you know. The mo&s;t popular of the fairies of Germany are &s;uppo&s;ed to be little men and women, who inhabit the iron and copper mines, and are, in general, very gracious and obliging. For in&s;tance, they will come in the night time into hou&s;es, and when a maid &s;ervant happens to be on good terms with them, that is when &s;he believes in their power with all her might, they will clean her plates and di&s;hes after an entertainment; put her rooms in order, and even give her an idea of it in her &s;leep, &s;o that as a fairy was never known in this country to fib, though with us they are &s;omewhat given to lying, &s;he indulges her&s;elf with a nap extraordinary; and is &s;ure to find all her work done to her hands when &s;he comes down. They come al&s;o into &s;hops, warehou&s;es, &amp;c. with the &s;ame indu&s;trious and good natured intention. The taylor ri&s;es and finds the half fini&s;hed &s;uit ready to take home;
<PB N="143" REF="154">the cobler his &s;hoes, &amp;c. Neverthele&s;s, when ill-treated, the&s;e powerful little &s;pirits are cruelly vindictive, and will hide, mangle, and de&s;troy every thing before them: in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the arti&s;an, they will pull his work to pieces, in&s;tead of befriending the poor maid &s;er|vant, they will trepan her with fair promi&s;es, that thus cajoled, they may tempt her to lie in bed that &s;he may get a good &s;colding. In fine, tho&s;e per&s;ons who take any delight in knowing our neighbours are on the whole upon a level with our&s;elves, may plea&s;e them&s;elves with the thought, that if foreigners have all the virtues, they have likewi&s;e all the weakne&s;&s;es of human nature.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not forget under the article &s;uper|&s;ition to mention that in the pretty country of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">uthward of We&s;tphalia, they have an Idea that cats are to be reconciled to a new re&s;idence only by coercive mea&s;ures. In pur|&s;uance of which notion, a widow woman, at who&s;e hou&s;e I lodged, impri&s;oned a poor cat three nights and days in a dark room, to the entire de&s;truction of my re&s;t, and almo&s;t to the cat's in&s;anity, in order to make her in love with her new hou&s;e. Now in England, you know, where cats are not a whit more remarkable for an amiable di&s;po&s;ition, we &s;hould have
<PB N="144" REF="155">&s;troked the poor animal till &s;he purred appro|bation: we &s;hould have permitted her to feed and &s;leep the fir&s;t night by our fire-&s;ide, and &s;o ho&s;pitably treated her, that at the breakfa&s;t table next morning, &s;he would have found her|&s;elf one of the family.</P>
<P>Not that I would have you &s;uppo&s;e I am an advocate for the feline race, except on general principles of ju&s;tice and mercy. A dog is often an <HI>example</HI> to his ma&s;ter, and a proper object of his love, honour, imitation, and good faith. But a cat I take to be (with very rare exceptions indeed) both a traitor and a &s;yco|phant. She is won to you only by fawnings, and if you puni&s;h her on ever &s;o ju&s;t a cau&s;e, &s;he either &s;trikes immediately, or owes you a grudge, the unexecuted malice of which &s;he can hold till an opportunity of vengeance occurs. Even when you imagine you have gained her affections, &s;he will de&s;ert you, like a faithle&s;s lover, and elope from your arms.</P>
<P>Perhaps, you may not think this the proper moment to introduce an anecdote of one of the&s;e in&s;idious creatures. You may &s;u&s;pect me of imitating the Grimalkin di&s;po&s;ition by &s;it|ting down in malice. Were I about to become an accu&s;er it might be &s;o: but what I have now
<PB N="145" REF="156">to mention exhibits no charge, though it will report an unlucky event.</P>
<P>In this very town of Cleves, which with its environs will detain us &s;ome time longer, I was re&s;iding with a Pru&s;&s;ian family, during the time of the fair; which I &s;hall pa&s;s over, having nothing remarkable to di&s;tingui&s;h it from other annual meetings, where people a&s;&s;emble to &s;tare at, cheat each other, and divert them&s;elves, and to &s;pend the year's &s;avings in buying tho&s;e bargains which would have been probably better bought at home. One day after dinner, as the de&s;ert was ju&s;t brought on the table, the travelling German mu&s;icians, who commonly ply the hou&s;es at the&s;e times, pre&s;ented them|&s;elves and were &s;uffered to play, and ju&s;t as they were making their bows for the money they received for their harmony, a bird-catcher who had rendered him&s;elf famous for educat|ing and calling forth the talents of the feathered race, made his appearance, and was well received by our party, which was numerous and benevolent. The mu&s;icians, who had heard of this bird-catcher's &s;ame, begged per|mi&s;&s;ion to &s;tay; and the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e who had a great &s;hare of good-nature, indulged their curio&s;ity: a curio&s;ity, indeed, which every body participated; for all that we have
<PB N="146" REF="157">heard or &s;een of learned pigs, a&s;&s;es, dogs, and hor&s;es was &s;aid to be extingui&s;hed in the won|derful wi&s;dom, which blazed in the genius of this birdcatcher's canary. The canary was produced, and the owner harangued him in the following manner, placing him upon his fore|finger. Bijou (jewel) you are now in the pre&s;ence of per&s;ons of great &s;agacity and honour: take heed you do not deceive the ex|pectations they have conceived of you from the world's report: you have got laurels: beware their withering. In a word, deport your&s;elf like the bijou (the jewel) of canary birds, as you certainly are.</P>
<P>All this time the bird &s;eemed to li&s;ten, and, indeed, placed him&s;elf in the true attitude of attention, by &s;loping his head to the ear of the man, and then di&s;tinctly nodding twice when his ma&s;ter left off &s;peaking; and if ever nods were intelligible and promi&s;&s;ory, the&s;e were two of them.</P>
<P>That's good, &s;ays the ma&s;ter, pulling off his hat to the bird. Now, then, let us &s;ee if you are a canary of honour. Give us a tune:&mdash;The canary &s;ung. P&s;haw, that's too har&s;h: 'tis the note of a raven with a hoar&s;ene&s;s upon
<PB N="147" REF="158">him: &s;omething pathetic. The canary whi&s;tled as if its little throat was changed to a lute. Fa&s;ter, &s;ays the man.&mdash;Slower&mdash;very well&mdash; but what a plague is this foot about, and this little head.&mdash;No wonder you are out, Mr. Bijou, when you forget your time. That's a jewel.&mdash;<HI>Bravo, bravo,</HI> my little man.</P>
<P>All that he was ordered or reminded of did he do to admiration. His head and foot beat time&mdash;humoured the variations both of tone and movement; and, "the &s;ound was a ju&s;t echo to the &s;en&s;e," according to the &s;tricte&s;t laws of poetical, and (as it <HI>ought</HI> to be) of mu&s;ical compo&s;ition&mdash;<HI>Bravo! bravo!</HI> re-echoed from all parts of the dining-room.&mdash;The mu&s;icians &s;wore the canary was a greater ma&s;ter of mu&s;ic than any of their band. And do you not &s;hew your &s;en&s;e of this civility, Sir, cries the birdcatcher, with an angry air. The canary bowed mo&s;t re&s;pectfully, to the great delight of the company. His next achieve|ment was going through martial exerci&s;e with a &s;traw gun, after which, my poor bijou, &s;ays his owner, thou ha&s;t had hard work, and mu&s;t be a little weary: a few performances more, and thou &s;halt repo&s;e. Shew the ladies how to make a curt&s;ey.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="159">The bird here cro&s;&s;ed his taper legs, and &s;unk and ro&s;e with an ea&s;e and grace that would have put half our &s;ub&s;cription a&s;&s;embly belles to the blu&s;h&mdash;That's my fine bird&mdash;and now a bow, head and foot corre&s;ponding. Here the &s;triplings for ten miles round London might have blu&s;hed al&s;o. Let us fini&s;h with an horn|pipe, my brave little fellow&mdash;that's it&mdash;keep it up, keep it up.</P>
<P>The activity, glee, &s;pirit, and accuracy with which this la&s;t order was obeyed, wound up the applau&s;e, (in which all the mu&s;icians joined, as well with their in&s;truments as their clap|pings) to the highe&s;t pitch of admiration. Bijou, him&s;elf, &s;eemed to feel the &s;acred thir&s;t of fame, and &s;hook his little plumes, and carolled an <HI>Io paean</HI> that &s;ounded like the con|&s;cious notes of victory.</P>
<P>Thou ha&s;t done all my biddings bravely, &s;aid the ma&s;ter, care&s;&s;ing his feathered &s;ervant; now then, take a nap, while I take thy place. Hereupon the canary went into a counterfeit &s;lumber, &s;o like the effect of the poppied god, fir&s;t &s;hutting one eye, then the other, then nod|ding, then dropping &s;o much on one &s;ide, that the hands of &s;everal of the company were &s;tretched out to &s;ave him from falling, and ju&s;t
<PB N="149" REF="160">as tho&s;e hands approached his feathers, &s;uddenly recovering and dropping as much on the other; at length the &s;leep &s;eemed to fix him in a &s;teady po&s;ture; whereupon the man took him from his finger, and laid him flat upon the table, where the man a&s;&s;ured us he would re|main in a good &s;ound &s;leep, while he him&s;elf had the honour to do his be&s;t to fill up the interval. Accordingly, after drinking a gla&s;s of wine, (in the progre&s;s of taking off which he was interrupted by the canary bird &s;pringing &s;uddenly up to a&s;&s;ert his right to a &s;hare, really putting his little bill into the gla&s;s, and then laying him&s;elf down to &s;leep again) the owner called him a &s;aucy fellow, and began to &s;hew off his own independent powers of entertaining. The <HI>forte</HI> of the&s;e lay chiefly in balancing with a tobacco pipe, while he &s;moked with another, and &s;everal of the po&s;itions were &s;o difficult to be pre&s;erved, yet maintained with &s;uch dex|terity, that the general attention was fixed upon him. But while he was thus exhibiting, an huge black car, who had been no doubt on the watch, from &s;ome unob&s;erved corner &s;prung upon the table, &s;eized the poor canary in its mouth, and ru&s;hed out of the window in de&s;pite of oppo&s;ition. Though the dining room was emptied in an in&s;tant, it was a vain pur&s;uit; the life of the bird was gone, and its
<PB N="150" REF="161">mangled body was brought in by the unfor|tunate owner in &s;uch di&s;may, accompanied by &s;uch looks and language, as mu&s;t have awaked pity in a mi&s;anthrope. He &s;pread him half|length over the table, and mourned his canary|bird with the mo&s;t undi&s;&s;embled &s;orrow. Well may I grieve for thee, poor little thing; well may I grieve: more than four years ha&s;t thou fed from my hand, drank from my lip, and flept in my bo&s;om. I owe to thee my &s;upport, my health, my &s;trength, and my happine&s;s; without thee what will become of me. Thou it was who en&s;ured my welcome in the be&s;t company. It was thy genius only made me welcome. But thy death is a ju&s;t puni&s;hment for my vanity: had I relied only on thy happy powers, all had been well, and thou had&s;t been perch'd on my finger, or lulled in my brea&s;t at this moment! but tru&s;ting to my own talents, and glorifying my|&s;elf in them, a judgment has fallen upon me, and thou art dead and mangled on this table. Accur&s;ed be the hour I entered this hou&s;e! and more accur&s;ed the dete&s;table mon&s;ter that killed thee! Accur&s;ed be <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> for I contri|buted. I ought not to have taken away my eyes when thine were clo&s;ed in frolic. O, bijou, my deare&s;t only bijou, would I were dead al&s;o!</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="162">As near as the &s;pirit of his di&s;ordered mind can be transfu&s;ed, &s;uch was the language and &s;entiment of the forlorn birdcatcher; who&s;e de&s;pairing motion and frantic air no words can paint. He took from his pocket a little green bag of faded velvet, and taking out of it &s;ome wool and cotton, that were the wrap|ping of whi&s;tles, bird calls, and other in&s;tru|ments of his trade, (all of which he threw on the table, "as in &s;corn,") and making a couch, placed the mutilated limbs and ravaged fea|thers of his canary upon it, and renewed his lamentations.</P>
<P>The&s;e were now much &s;oftened, as is ever the ca&s;e, when the rage of grief yields to its tenderne&s;s: when it is too much overpowered by the effect to advert to the cau&s;e. It is need|le&s;s to ob&s;erve to you, that every one of the company &s;ympathi&s;ed with him. But none more than the band of <HI>mu&s;icians,</HI> who, being engaged in a profe&s;&s;ion that naturally keeps the &s;en&s;ibilities more or le&s;s in exerci&s;e, felt the di&s;tre&s;s of the poor bird-man with peculiar force. It was really a banquet to &s;ee the&s;e people gathering them&s;elves into a knot, and after whi&s;pering, wiping their eyes, and blow|ing their no&s;es, depute one from among&s;t them to be the medium of conveying into the pocket
<PB N="152" REF="163">of the bird-man, the very contribution they had ju&s;t before received for their own efforts. The poor fellow perceiving them, took from the pocket the little parcel they had rolled up, and brought out with it, by an unlucky accident, another little bag, at the &s;ight of which he was extremely agitated; for it con|tained the canary &s;eed, the food of the "dear lo&s;t companion of his art." There is no giving language to the effect of this trifling circum|&s;tance upon the poor fellow; he threw down the contribution money that he brought from his pocket along with it, not with an ungrateful but with a de&s;perate hand. He opened the bag, which was fa&s;tened with red tape, and tak|ing out &s;ome of the &s;eed put it to the very bill of the lifele&s;s bird, exclaiming&mdash;No, poor bijou, no&mdash;thou can'&s;t not peck any more out of this hand, that has been thy feeding place &s;o many years&mdash;thou can'&s;t remember how happy we both were when I bought this bag full for thee. Had it been filled with gold thou had'&s;t de&s;erved it. It &s;hall be <HI>filled,</HI>&mdash;and with gold, &s;aid the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, if I could afford it.</P>
<P>The good man ro&s;e from his &s;eat, which had long been unea&s;y to him, and gently taking the bag, put into it &s;ome &s;ilver; &s;aying, as he
<PB N="153" REF="164">handed it to his neare&s;t neighbour, who will refu&s;e to follow my example; it is not a &s;ub|&s;cription for mere charity, it is a tribute to one of the rare&s;t things in the whole world; namely, to real feeling, in this &s;ophi&s;tical, pretending, parading age. If ever the pa&s;&s;ion of love and gratitude was in the heart of man, it is in the heart of that unhappy fellow, and whether the object that calls out &s;uch feelings be bird, bea&s;t, fi&s;h, or man, it is alike, virtue and&mdash; ought <HI>to be rewarded</HI>&mdash;&s;aid his next neighbour, putting into the bag his quota. It is &s;uper|fluous to tell you that after the &s;eed had been taken wholly away, and put very delicately out of the poor man's &s;ight, every body mo&s;t chearfully contributed to make up a pur&s;e, to repair (as much as money could), the bird|man's lo&s;s. The la&s;t per&s;on applied to, was a very beautiful German young lady, who as &s;he placed her bounty into the bag, clo&s;ed it im|mediately after, and blu&s;hed. As there are all &s;orts of blu&s;hes, (at lea&s;t one to every action of our lives, that is worth any characteri&s;tic feeling, &s;uppo&s;ing the actor can feel at all) Su&s;picion would have thought this young lady, who was &s;o anxious to conceal her gift, gave little or nothing; but candour who rea&s;ons in a different manner, would &s;uppo&s;e what was really the ca&s;e&mdash;that it was a blu&s;h not of
<PB N="154" REF="165">avarice and deception, but of benevolence graced by mode&s;ty. Curio&s;ity, however, caught the bag, opened it, and turned out its contents, among&s;t which was a <HI>golden ducat,</HI> that by its date and brightne&s;s had been hoarded. Ah ha, &s;aid curio&s;ity, who does this belong to, I wonder? Guilt and innocence, avarice and benignity, are alike hone&s;t in one point; &s;ince they all in the moment of attack, by &s;ome means or another, di&s;cover what they wi&s;h to conceal. There was not in the then large company a &s;ingle per&s;on, who could not have exclaimed to this young lady, with a&s;&s;urance of the truth&mdash;<HI>Thou art the woman!</HI> There was no denying the fact; it was written on every feature of her enchanting face. She &s;truggled, however, with the accu&s;ation almo&s;t to tears, but they were &s;uch tears, as would have given lu&s;tre to the fine&s;t eyes in the world, for they gave lu&s;tre to her's, and would have added effulgence to a ray of the &s;un.</P>
<P>Well then, if no body el&s;e will own this neglected ducat, cried the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, who was uncle to the lady abovementioned, I will: whereupon he took it from the heap, and exchanged it for two others, which enriched the collection.</P>
<P>While the bu&s;ine&s;s of the heart was thus carrying on, the poor birdman, who was the
<PB N="155" REF="166">occa&s;ion and object of it, was at fir&s;t divided by contrary emotions of pain and plea&s;ure: his eye &s;ometimes directed to the ma&s;&s;acred canary, and &s;ometimes to the company: at length genero&s;ity proved the &s;tronger emotion, and grief ebbed away. He had lo&s;t a bird, but he had gained the goodwill of many human beings. That bird, it is true, was his pride and &s;upport, but this was not the cri&s;is any longer to bewail its fate. He accepted the contribution-pur&s;e, by one means or another filled like the &s;ack of Benjamin, even to the brim, and bowed but &s;poke not; then folding up the corp&s;e of the canary in its wool and cotton &s;hroud, departed with one of tho&s;e looks, that the moment it is &s;een is felt and under&s;tood, but for which, being too powerful for de&s;cription, no language has yet been pro|vided. On going out he beckoned the mu&s;icians to follow. They did &s;o, &s;triking a few chords that would have graced the funeral of Juliet. My very &s;oul pur&s;ued the &s;ounds, and &s;o did my feet. I ha&s;ted to the outer door, and &s;aw the bird-man contending about re|turning the money, which the <HI>founders</HI> of the benevolence (for &s;uch were the mu&s;icians) had &s;ub&s;cribed.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="167">I have nothing to add to this Gleaning, but a piece of information that belongs to it; the very next morning I was a witne&s;s to two traits of the heart of the ma&s;ter of the man&s;ion where the&s;e tran&s;actions had pa&s;t. A nobler minded man lived not&mdash;Alas, he is no more.

I have not a doubt but all we have done atones but &s;cantily for the lo&s;s of &s;uch a friend. Ju&s;t as he &s;aid this, the niece, who&s;e per&s;on and mind I have already gleaned for you, came into the breakfa&s;t room: And now, &s;aid the old gentleman, to fini&s;h this bu&s;ine&s;s.

I

<P>Much of this was &s;poken with tender diffi|culty, and the gift was received with more: but &s;he loved the hand which in the fir&s;t in|&s;tance had enabled her to be generous too well not to reward it. Was not this, indeed, an illu&s;tration of the virtue of the man of Ro&s;s, who

<HEAD>LETTER LXVI. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>AND you tell me I am not di&s;appointed. I <HI>have</HI> your thanks. Under &s;uch encourage|ments, I re&s;ume the pen with alacrity. It is incon&s;i&s;tent with the plan of this corre&s;pondence to &s;et down a formal li&s;t of roads or routes, or to pre&s;ent a meagre catalogue of cities, towns, and villages. When you are at a centrical place, as Cleves, for in&s;tance, you can &s;carce take an unplea&s;ant cour&s;e in &s;uch a Duchy, and if you are di&s;po&s;ed to make the tour of We&s;t|phalia, on a plan of plea&s;ure, or health, it is nearly immaterial whether from this its capital, you verge towards the South, or to the We&s;t, the Ea&s;t, or the North; &s;o abundant are the beauties on every &s;ide. But, previous to a more exten&s;ive excur&s;ion, there are in re&s;erve for the deliberate traveller a great variety of rural beauties, which lie entirely out of the ordinary track, and which are, therefore, generally pa&s;t, not only un&s;een, but unheard of. To &s;ome of the&s;e I &s;hall direct you, becau&s;e they de&s;erve your attention, and will, probably, never otherwi&s;e have it. A &s;tranger no &s;ooner gains
<PB N="159" REF="170">Cleves, than he &s;ets off for Du&s;&s;eldorf, Mae&s;|tricht, Aix la Chapelle, or Spa; and all the &s;weet &s;ide &s;cenery, and enchanting villages be|hind are left neglected, becau&s;e they do not happen to lie in the broad high road of a large town: and to drive from one large town to another &s;eems to be one of the grand re&s;olutions of modern travel. For this rea&s;on I pre&s;ume it is, that a real lover of the &s;till &s;mall voice of nature may re&s;ide in an out-of-the-WAY village, in any part of the Dutch, Pru&s;&s;ian, or German dominions, and never &s;o much as hear it men|tioned, even among&s;t the <HI>traditions</HI> of the place, that an Engli&s;h traveller had &s;ojourned therein for a &s;ingle day. Hence (to &s;peak only of the hundreds of deliciou&s;ly-&s;eque&s;tered &s;pots, that are &s;ituated in the neighbourhood of Arnheim, and of Nimeguen, one way, and of Cleves and Emeric another) you may as well look for the Emperor of Morocco as for an elegant fo|reigner, or any re&s;ident foreigner at all, except here and there a &s;traggling family, whom ne|ce&s;&s;ity hath driven into retreat. But whether ob&s;erved or not by the du&s;t-loving eyes of vanity and fa&s;hion, nature goes &s;ilently and bloomingly on. I would recommend <HI>you,</HI> my friend, and all other of her genuine admirers, to &s;eek her in the agreeable country of Kuyh, in the little principality of Boxmeer, and in
<PB N="160" REF="171">the enchanting bounds of Pru&s;&s;ian Guelderland. All of the&s;e, indeed, po&s;&s;e&s;s beauties, that to be won, mu&s;t be woo'd; for they are &s;everal leagues out of the common, or, if you plea&s;e, of the <HI>fa&s;hionable</HI> track: but then they are in the direct road to nature, and their paths are peace.</P>
<P>I performed the whole tour of Pru&s;&s;ian Guel|derland on foot, and I know not the period of my life that has been &s;o truely pa&s;toral. I &s;topped at every town and village, and verily think I &s;hould have been welcome at every hou&s;e. You are convinced of the general fer|tility of the &s;oil by the abundant fleeces of the &s;heep, and of the &s;alubrity of the air by the florid countenances of the people. Though the country mu&s;t, in a general view, be called level, it is furni&s;hed with great variety. Long, meandring green lanes, plea&s;ant inter&s;per&s;ed thickets (principally of fir and oak) Arcadian|looking cottages, all in the be&s;t repair; vene|rable ca&s;tles, an infinity of towers, &s;teeples, &s;pires, convents, and ancient abbeys; meadow|grounds, often compacted into little verdant enclo&s;ures, often expanded into &s;pacious fields; the whole fertilized by delicious &s;treams, fed by their parent flood: the Mai&s;e, which, were it near my natal banks, would become a rival
<PB N="161" REF="172">to the Thames&mdash;all the&s;e attracting objects diver&s;ify the view. It mu&s;t be owned that a league of uniformly dreary heath ground fre|quently intervenes; but even this is relieved by herds, flocks, and &s;hepherds; and, by the power of contra&s;t, the &s;terility becomes a not unintere&s;ting object in a traveller's picture.</P>
<P>For the inhabitants, I &s;cruple not to propo&s;e them, in addition to my former ob&s;ervations, among&s;t the models of imitation for the good people of England, in point of plea&s;antry, and u&s;eful courte&s;y. I &s;hould be wor&s;e than un|generous, I &s;hould be ungrateful, were I to refu&s;e them their merits on this head. In the cour&s;e of one day's Gleaning, as if de&s;tiny had planned it on purpo&s;e to &s;hew me &s;ome &s;peci|mens of real urbanity, among&s;t a &s;et of per&s;ons who had certainly never &s;tudied it as an art of politene&s;s, but cultivated it as a gift of nature, I was ble&s;t with the happy faculty of lo&s;ing my way frequently. As I pa&s;&s;ed along from a little village called Gey&s;teren, to another named Venrai, a &s;hepherd, perceiving me long before I &s;aw him, came running to a&s;&s;ure me that I was out of all tracks, and then enquiring my de&s;tination, attended me on my way, till it was too direct for any one, but a man who deviates by de&s;ign, to mi&s;s. His &s;heep-dog quarrelled
<PB N="162" REF="173">with my little &s;paniel, and the &s;hepherd, de|&s;irous to teach him &s;ome of his own good manners, held him by the collar, and ha|rangued him on the &s;ubject of rudene&s;s to &s;trangers; during which eloquence he growled yet more, as cro&s;s creatures generally do when forced to hear good advice. By that happy knack of getting into a <HI>wrong</HI> road with which I am gifted, I was obliged to a&s;k for the <HI>right</HI> ju&s;t at &s;un-&s;etting. I &s;aw a pea&s;ant at his door. Pray, friend, is this the way to Venrai?&mdash;"This is the fir&s;t hou&s;e that belongs to quite a dif|ferent town, &s;ir. You are a mile further to the left than you ought to be." Off &s;et my pea&s;ant without &s;aying another word, and did not &s;top till we had gained the fir&s;t hou&s;e of the hamlet I had enquired for. "You mu&s;t now go <HI>right out,</HI> &s;ir," &s;aid the guide, and, before I had time to thank or reward him, he was out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>Earlier in the day I had enquired of an ancient woman, on her way to the church, the road to a little village called <HI>Wel,</HI> on the banks of the Mai&s;e. She informed me, but &s;u&s;pecting I might not under&s;tand her, &s;he &s;tood, una&s;ked, till I had taken the right path. The good woman then went away &s;atisfied that &s;he had done me a &s;ervice. By a &s;ort of characteri&s;tic fatality, I made the &s;econd turning the rever&s;e
<PB N="163" REF="174">of my information. "To the right about, &s;ir," quoth the old woman, who e&s;pied me from another place, where &s;he had made a &s;tand. You, my friend, who know my methods, will not wonder to hear that I followed the impul&s;e which led me to run acro&s;s the fields, purely to take hold of her hand, and give her the thanks of my heart. By an impul&s;e no le&s;s genuine, and, perhaps, more generous, &s;he went back to my ground with me, and would not leave me till &s;he had made, <HI>as one would have thought,</HI> another mi&s;take impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Yet I contrived it. The bewitching &s;tory of Marmontel's &s;hepherde&s;s of the Alps, which I read to relieve a long walk over a heath, con|ducted me, ju&s;t at the termination of the &s;aid heath, and of the &s;aid &s;tory, into a farmer's yard. Being Sabbath-day, the farmer was regaling him&s;elf with folded arms, and a &s;hort pipe in his mouth. Suppo&s;ing I had bu&s;ine&s;s with him, he conducted me into his hou&s;e, which was &s;urely kept by the godde&s;s of <HI>Pro|pret&eacute;</HI> (neatne&s;s) if &s;uch a divinity there be. I explained, and apologi&s;ed. He &s;miled, and thanked me.&mdash;"But you mu&s;t be weary, &s;ir; repo&s;e, and refre&s;h." In an in&s;tant, as if by magic, the table was &s;pread, and &s;o white a cloth; bread, butter, and milk &s;o good, and
<PB N="164" REF="175">a welcome &s;o cordial, that I mu&s;t beg of you, if ever you make the tour of Pru&s;&s;ian Guelder|land, to attempt wandering, by happy negli|gence, or, if that fails you, by well-timed con|trivance, into a farmer's yard; no matser where, as this man is but a &s;pecimen of his countrymen.</P>
<P>Nor were the&s;e examples of urbanity all: at noon of the &s;ame day, I was re&s;cued from the mo&s;t imminent danger, by a good natured fellow, who informed me I was making the be&s;t of my way into a quagmire. Nor is this courte&s;y confined to the pea&s;antry. It extends to all cla&s;&s;es. At no ungleanable di&s;tance from my proper path, I was attracted by a magni|ficent ca&s;tle, and, relying on the courteous, general character of the country, I entered its venerable and awe-in&s;piring gate. The family were at Liege. The dome&s;tic chaplain only remained at home. He was &s;aying grace, and cro&s;&s;ing him&s;elf, ju&s;t as I entered his apart|ment.&mdash;Pardon the <HI>ill-tim'd</HI> vi&s;it of a curious Engli&s;h &s;tranger&mdash;was my opening &s;peech. "<HI>Well-tim'd,</HI> I hope it will prove, as I am &s;ure it is welcome," was his reply, ri&s;ing from his &s;eat, and placing me in it. I had already, in my kind of running way, taken refre&s;hments at half a dozen cottages; an apple at one, a
<PB N="165" REF="176">cake at another, a cordial at a third, and &s;o on; but the good chaplain "&s;o gaily pre&s;s'd and &s;mil'd," as he &s;et a clean cover, napkin, &s;ilver fork, and &s;poon, before me, I could not but accept the invitation. After our repa&s;t, learning the object of my vi&s;it, he made with me the tour of the chateau, which, had it been in&s;pected by a critic in paintings, pictures, and an amateur of Gothic architecture, would have been the journey of a day. In our way back to his room, we pa&s;&s;ed into a very noble garden, with the fruits and flowers of which he loaded my pockets and hands; and when, after a parting gla&s;s of wine, I left the apartment in which I had fir&s;t &s;een him&mdash;"Remember, &s;ir, this has been par&s;on's fare; the next vi&s;it you make, the owners of the ca&s;tle, whom I &s;o faintly repre&s;ent, and who are to be here to-night, will do you more honour." The name of this fine ca&s;tle is <HI>Wel,</HI> on the We&s;t &s;ide of a very picture&s;que little Pru&s;&s;ian village, upon the banks, and almo&s;t upon the brims of the Rhine, that maje&s;tic river, which, you know, common geography tells you, nd truly tells, ri&s;es from two &s;prings in the Alps, and runs North to the lake of Con&s;tance, then We&s;t to Ba&s;il, afterwards North between Swabia and Al&s;ace, then pa&s;&s;ing through the Palatinate,
<PB N="166" REF="177">the Electorate, and the Duchy of Cleves, at la&s;t enters the Netherlands, five miles below Cleves, where it becomes broad and rapid. The direct cour&s;e of this noble river is above 500 miles; it is generally one quarter, and, in &s;ome places, half a mile broad, and from one and a half to &s;even fathoms in depth. It is navigable to Bafil in Switzerland, which is four hundred miles, by long boats with round bottoms, which commonly go at the rate of four miles an hour, and, in the&s;e, pa&s;&s;engers are conveyed at the ea&s;y rate of one &s;tiver (one penny) for five miles: but the navigation of the Rhine, like that of the Danube, is inter|rupted by nine cataracts, the principal of which is at Shaffhau&s;an, in Switzerland, where the whole river falls from an height of 75 feet. But what is there in the whole of this de&s;crip|tion, my friend, that fills the imagination, or warms the heart, like the philanthropy of the chaplain of the ca&s;tle? The &s;imple &s;tream of good will, that flowed from his bounty to me, indicated a &s;oul, who&s;e "genial current" had it not been checked by more ob&s;tructions than the cataracts of the Danube, or the Rhine, would have fertilized and enriched more than tho&s;e mighty waters. I have pur&s;ued the cour&s;e of both the&s;e rivers, for many a beautiful league.
<PB N="167" REF="178">I have gazed, with all the fondne&s;s of a real lover of nature, and, with &s;omething of a poet's eye, on their numerous objects. I have painted, with an ardent pencil, &s;ome of their land&s;capes; I have often wondered and ad|mired, but never yet did I &s;ee, or feel, on their bo&s;oms, or on their banks, unle&s;s proceeding from &s;imilar &s;ources&mdash;the &s;ources of philan|thropy&mdash;any thing &s;o touching as the little &s;cenery of an hour, in and about the Chateau of Wel, &s;o true it is that
<Q>"An hone&s;t man's the <HI>noble&s;t</HI> work of God."</Q> But, alas, fortune, according to her caprices, is either the lavi&s;h fountain that feeds the &s;tream of human benevolence, or the &s;tupendous and immoveable cataract, that contracts its cour&s;e, and circum&s;cribes its power. Of our Pru&s;&s;ian prie&s;t, I have only further to &s;ay, that every look, word, and action, proved
<Q>"Large was his bounty, and his &s;oul &s;incere;</Q> And I have not a doubt that
<Q>"Heav'n has as large a recompen&s;e be&s;tow'd,</Q> in the te&s;timony of his own con&s;cience.</P>
<P>Friends he ought to have in abundance, but he has gained one more, while there is the breath of life in the Gleaner. Nay, I am willing
<PB N="168" REF="179">to extend the date of my gratitude towards him beyond the grave; for if any thing that hath been done in this &s;ublunary &s;phere is worthy to be remembered in another, it is &s;urely the fair deeds, and authors of a genero&s;ity, that is free from being polluted by the dro&s;&s;y ma|terials of the pre&s;ent world. If &s;o, what a claim has the unbought, and un&s;ullied act of this blamele&s;s prie&s;t on the memory of your friend, when his powers of recollection &s;hall be immortal. Since the day on which I re|ceived the bounty I have not &s;een the bene|factor, but I often plea&s;e my&s;elf by reflecting that my &s;en&s;e of his goodne&s;s will be among&s;t the &s;acred plea&s;ures that I may rea&s;onably hope &s;hall not "quit me when I die."</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not take leave of the Rhine till I have mentioned the amu&s;ement in re|&s;erve for you, on the borders of that Imperial river. The continual commerce and pa&s;&s;age of people over the different ferrys of that, as well as its neighbour, the Mai&s;e, is very di|verting; and, though you &s;ometimes &s;eem in a country where, if one of the villages was emptied of its inhabitants, they would &s;carcely fill a boat, you will perceive multitudes almo&s;t every half hour during the Summer, pouring in &s;hoals to the &s;trand. I was much
<PB N="166" REF="180">entertained in a ramble I made to the pretty village of Elton, which is in the neighbour|hood of Cleves, and one of the mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed beauties of the Duchy, part &s;tanding upon an almo&s;t Cambrian-looking mountain, and part in a delightful valley. It is &s;ituate on the other &s;ide of the Lower Rhine, on pa&s;&s;ing which, I found my&s;elf in the Pont|Volant (Flying-bridge-boat) with, at lea&s;t, an hundred people, the greater part of whom were &s;inging hymns, p&s;alms, and Ave-Mary's, in chorus. Never did I behold &s;uch a collection of &s;orrowful countenances, nor hear &s;uch a concert of &s;olemn cries: and I &s;hould have been ju&s;tified in &s;uppo&s;ing the whole party to be mad, had I not been told they were only penitential. They were Pru&s;&s;ian pea&s;ants come from their pilgrimage to Kaveler, a village, (where I may u&s;e the word <HI>millions,</HI> in &s;peaking of the numbers) which yearly receives the homage of the German people, of all ranks and &s;exes. It is the Mecca of this quarter of the globe. The groupe in que&s;tion were ju&s;t come from a confe&s;&s;ion of their &s;ins, and were filled with compunction, or with con&s;cious ab&s;olution; and as the fir&s;t or la&s;t of the&s;e operated, they were &s;unk to the du&s;t with &s;hame, or treading in air with joy. On their landing, they formed them&s;elves into two
<PB N="170" REF="181">bands, &s;inging in proce&s;&s;ion, and with their hats off. I gleaned them all the way from Elton in the vale to Elton on the Hill, and never beheld &s;o moving a curio&s;ity. Never|thele&s;s, a &s;mall circum&s;tance happened, that, for a moment, di&s;concerted the gravity of their progre&s;s. In a&s;cending the &s;teep, one of the penitents made a fal&s;e &s;tep, and came down in &s;o unlucky a way, that Religion her|&s;elf mu&s;t have &s;miled, as, indeed, &s;he did, in the per&s;ons of tho&s;e her &s;terne&s;t, and perhaps true&s;t votaries: for there is a certain &s;park of waggery in human nature that can no more help the force of ridicule, on the &s;ight of a ludicrous object, than hunger can re&s;i&s;t ap|pea&s;ing appetite, when the means are in its power. And this fall was ludicrous enough, being, indeed, an expo&s;ure of what has, by pro&s;cription, and by habit, been long con|&s;idered as the mo&s;t ridiculous part of human nature: at lea&s;t the one that has been mo&s;t &s;ub|ject and obnoxious to ridicule. The poor penitent, indeed, would, I believe, have laught her&s;elf, but that &s;he looked on her fall as a judgement, and &s;o contented her&s;elf with doubling her Ave-Marias, and continuing the proce&s;&s;ion with more zeal than ever.</P>
<P>I will not trouble you with the long li&s;t of religious miracles believed to be wrought by
<PB N="171" REF="182">the Virgin in favour of the good Catholics that re&s;ort to Kaveler. However great the&s;e may be, the pre&s;ent race of French certainly have no faith in them; but on the contrary, when the armies of the Republic took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this place, the plunder was not only carried to the holy altars, but to the &s;acred figure it&s;elf. The &s;hrine was &s;tripped of all its long collected trea&s;ures, and, as &s;carce any votary goes empty handed, the&s;e were immen&s;e: be&s;ides which, a rigorous contribution was levied on the inha|bitants; an exorbitant &s;upply of &s;tockings, boots, &s;hoes, blankets, mu&s;kets, &amp;c. for the army was in&s;i&s;ted on; the image of the Virgin was &s;acrilegiou&s;ly polluted, and that of the Saviour of the world very narrowly e&s;caped the mock ceremony of the guillotine, the modern I&s;raelites, however, repeated their unhallowed practice, which I think I have before men|tioned &s;omewhere, of placing the red cap of licentiou&s;ne&s;s on its head, and writing on its &s;ide (as re&s;olving to refu&s;e even the Son of God his <HI>title</HI>) Voila, notre <HI>Ci-devant</HI> Seigneur.&mdash; Behold he who was <HI>formerly</HI> our Lord. His &s;acred head was ran&s;omed at no &s;mall co&s;t. When this place was retaken by the Au&s;trians, the vi&s;its of congratulation and condolence drew together an almo&s;t incalculable multitude of &s;upplicants, from every quarter of the Ger|man <PB N="172" REF="183">Empire. Perhaps, the devotion on that occa&s;ion mu&s;t go into &s;ome exce&s;&s;es; but I leave you to judge whether the extreme of penitence or of plunder, is the evil mo&s;t to be palliated.</P>
<P>The day &s;ucceeding this I &s;trolled &s;ome leagues farther into the country, and being overtaken by one of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ing &s;howers, which in &s;pring time collect, drop, and di&s;per&s;e almo&s;t in the &s;ame in&s;tant, I took &s;helter in a road-&s;ide hut, in which I caught the labourers ju&s;t &s;itting them&s;elves down to dinner. There were thirteen per&s;ons, including the maid &s;er|vant, who having &s;et the food on the table, took her chair among&s;t them. Their repa&s;t con&s;i&s;ted of nothing but one very large di&s;h of potatoes, for which they returned God, both before and after eating, as much, po&s;&s;ibly more thanks than he receives from many of his creatures, on whom he be&s;tows the riche&s;t delicacies of his creation. It was truly a picture, and a very beautiful one, drawn by the faithful hand of nature, of &s;ocial happine&s;s and religious decency, (for which the pea&s;antry of Germany are remarkable) amid&s;t the heavy duties and toils of life. I have only given you a &s;ingle &s;pecimen of a univer&s;al and invariable practice.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="184">With re&s;pect to government, all kings and high authorities will have, at lea&s;t, an equal number of enemies and friends. Of the former, the pre&s;ent Pru&s;&s;ian monarch has his &s;hare; and yet, as far, at lea&s;t, as the interior regulation of his kingdom is concerned, there &s;eems very little ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint. Where a &s;tanding army is enormous and per|petual, there mu&s;t be proportionate levies on &s;ome part of the people, to &s;upport that divi&s;ion of the citizens that take up arms in protection of the re&s;t. Yet, I know not the part of the earth, where more liberty of &s;peech or action is indulged than in the Pru&s;&s;ian territories. Political &s;ubjects are, indeed, forbidden, but this, as u&s;ual, only gives edge to the de&s;ire of doing what is inhibited: accordingly the monarch is <HI>cut up</HI> and <HI>carved</HI> at every public table in Pru&s;&s;ia, with as much freedom of abu&s;e as even a modern patriot could well long for. The ea&s;e with which the <HI>little</HI> folks ap|pear to live, notwith&s;tanding the exaction of royal rights, might be envied by the <HI>great</HI> folks of <HI>any</HI> nation. Their hou&s;es, and cottages are actually over&s;tocked, <HI>crouded</HI> with furniture; and although there is little or no &s;otting in the common public hou&s;es, each ordinary beer-hou&s;e, I am convinced, contains double the quantity of pots, gla&s;&s;es, china, &amp;c. which
<PB N="174" REF="185">would be nece&s;&s;ary to equip an Engli&s;h kitchen. In &s;hort, the only mi&s;ery-&s;truck hou&s;es to be &s;een in Pru&s;&s;ia, or generally &s;peaking in the German empire, are tho&s;e of the nobility and gentry in <HI>declining</HI> circum&s;tances. In their abodes, indeed, your generous heart would in vain &s;eek for the comforts and accommodations of the pea&s;antry. Di&s;mantled ca&s;tles, chateaus in decay without, and nearly empty within, tawdry beds, time or moth-eaten tape&s;try, ru&s;ty armories, broken pillars, and every &s;ign of high birth in low circum&s;tances, are exhibited to your aching &s;ight. Yet the labour and dif|ficulty with which the proprietors of the&s;e fragments endeavour to conceal the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es is wonderful. To &s;uch as have feeling hearts it is even pitiable. They keep up the family carriage, the family train of dome&s;tics, and the family liveries, which are overloaded with ornament, and almo&s;t &s;tarve them&s;elves to feed their vanity. Hence on a going out day, the magnificence of which is the oeconomy, the almo&s;t famine of a month, a pa&s;&s;ing &s;pectator would mi&s;take gaiety for happine&s;s, and gran|deur as only a &s;uperfluity of wealth. But never could it more truly be &s;aid, that "all which glitters is not gold." All this inconvenience and indigence ari&s;es from the cruel nece&s;&s;ity they are under to pre&s;erve the <HI>ways</HI> of men of
<PB N="175" REF="186">family without the <HI>means.</HI> A Pru&s;&s;ian gentle|man may not, con&s;i&s;tently with ance&s;tral dignity, enter into any &s;ort of profitable commerce to eke out a &s;lender patrimony: for trade though it might enrich the pocket is thought very much to impoveri&s;h the blood; on which account the&s;e martyrs to family honours go half naked and more than half un|fed. And while the proprietors of a few mi&s;erable and mortgage-eaten acres are &s;tarving upon their inherited pittance, and are right honourably in want of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, the plebeians, who are not forbid to make their blood &s;till poorer in order to pre&s;erve its purity, may carry on all the gainful arts without any other lo&s;s than the chance of being &s;tarved upon principles of good-breeding.</P>
<P>The little Signiory of Boxmeer, about &s;even leagues from Cleves, and five from Nimeguen, has claim to much of your attention. It is &s;ingularly &s;ituated: it is only a &s;hort mile di&s;tant from a part of Holland. You have but to ferry acro&s;s the Mai&s;e, and you are in Pru&s;&s;ia. On the other &s;ide of a &s;mall hamlet, you are in the dominions of the Emperor. To the right and left about a league you are in two other di&s;tinct Signiories, and in it&s;elf it is a principal|ity &s;o ab&s;olute, that life and death is in the
<PB N="176" REF="187">power of the reigning Prince, (who is of the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Hollenzollen) and who&s;e di&s;po&s;ition makes his de&s;potic power a mere &s;hadow of authority; for he is the parent of the people, and they enjoy all the privileges of an happy Republic. Yet even in this little well governed &s;tate, there are patriots who have been once vi&s;ited and plundered by the French; yet who are &s;till wi&s;hing the return of tho&s;e ravages. How unaccountable!</P>
<P>The Boxmeer farmers cultivate a mo&s;t beau|ful &s;eed they call <HI>&s;parcette,</HI> which yields two crops in the &s;ea&s;on, and the after one is gene|rally the be&s;t. The verdure is more exqui&s;ite than any thing I have ever &s;een: it re&s;embles in figure our wheat when very young, but &s;urpa&s;&s;es it abundantly in colour. The cows prefer it to gra&s;s, and return for it mo&s;t excellent butter.</P>
<P>There are two Carmelite Convents in Box|meer, one of which is for women. This latter I gleaned: (the other has nothing glean-worthy.) At the gate of the Convent for the men, I met a gentleman with whom I had been formerly acquainted: he appeared very pen&s;ive, and begged I would defer my vi&s;it to the Convent till the next day, and take my coffee at his
<PB N="177" REF="188">hou&s;e. I attended him. On our way to his villa, he told me that the object of his vi&s;it at the Convent was to conver&s;e with the &s;uperior on the &s;ubject of his niece, who was to enter upon her noviciate the next day. You remember Fanchette, perhaps, Sir, the hand&s;ome girl whom on your former vi&s;it to this village, you u&s;ed to call the Boxmeer Blo&s;&s;om. Her &s;i&s;ter if you recollect had buried her&s;elf alive; for you know my opinion on the &s;ubject&mdash;&s;ome little time before you left us&mdash;and to-morrow &s;he fini&s;hes her career, by taking the veil, So that I &s;hall lo&s;e both my dome&s;tic comforts for ever without any hope of &s;eeing them again; and you know how dear their company was to me, e&s;pecially &s;ince my &s;on continues a profli|gate, and has de&s;erted me&mdash;I was both affected and &s;urpri&s;ed at this intelligence; for the Boxmeer Blo&s;&s;om was fre&s;h in my remem|brance, and I recollect the regret with which I &s;aw her &s;i&s;ter pur&s;ue the fancy &s;he had taken on enclo&s;ing her&s;elf. This latter, indeed, was &s;omewhat of a pen&s;ive ca&s;t, and had if I may &s;o &s;ay, a bias to &s;eclu&s;ion, with the &s;uppo&s;ed incite|ment of a tender di&s;appointment: but the former was gay by nature, even to excentricity, and was addre&s;&s;ed by the man of her heart, with the &s;anction of her uncle, who was both able and willing to unite fortune with love.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="189">On entering the uncle's hou&s;e, we were told by a &s;ervant that Fanchette was gone on a cir|cuit to her neighbours to pay them her eternal adieus, but left word that &s;he &s;hould return to make her uncle's coffee. She performed her promi&s;e with &s;o much exactne&s;s that as the words <HI>uncle's coffee</HI> were pronounced, &s;he was almo&s;t in the act of pouring it out. Her air had lo&s;t none of its plea&s;antry, her features none of their beauty: &s;he was &s;till the Blo&s;&s;om of Boxmeer.</P>

<P>Soon after this &s;he made her exit, but in a few minutes came back to beg I would indulge
<PB N="180" REF="191">her with a moment's conver&s;ation in the garden. &mdash;I remember you perfectly, &s;aid &s;he, and feel uncomfortable that you &s;hould imagine I treat lightly the act I am about to do: but, be&s;ides that, from my very inmo&s;t &s;oul, I look upon as a fe&s;tival, what my friends call a funeral, I love my uncle mo&s;t dearly, though he continues to oppo&s;e my happine&s;s in the only point wherein it con&s;i&s;ts, and as I cannot re&s;i&s;t his tears, though I can his arguments, I have no other way but an apparent unconcern. Comfort him, therefore, as the la&s;t favour I intreat of you; per&s;uade him to reconcile him&s;elf to my felicity&mdash;and God pre&s;erve you.</P>
<P>She hereupon gave me her hand, and waving it &s;o as to forbid reply, went &s;miling out of the garden and &s;ought her chamber.</P>
<P>The next morning &s;he ro&s;e the &s;econd in the hou&s;e. As I am u&s;ually the fir&s;t of every family, go where I will, from a long-indulged habit of "enjoying the cool, the fragrant hour," we had another [&s;hort <HI>t&eacute;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te,</HI> in which &s;he informed me &s;he had ju&s;t come from taking an everla&s;ting leave of a featherbed, &s;heets, and &s;hift, which were to be exchanged for very oppo&s;ite pieces of furniture. The ceremony of throwing away her dre&s;s cap, and
<PB N="181" REF="192">all its <HI>plumery,</HI> as a &s;ign of her renouncing the vanities of the world, was &s;till to be performed, as had previou&s;ly been &s;ettled.</P>
<P>Her deportment was more aweful than on the former day, but her attempered air, and &s;ober &s;tep, took nothing from her per&s;onal attractions.</P>
<P>I &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of her, on a promi&s;e to attend her in her la&s;t moments. She &s;aid the nece&s;&s;ity, as well as the time of a&s;&s;umed viva|city was now pa&s;t, but that &s;he felt a wi&s;h I &s;hould gratify my curio&s;ity, and again recom|mended her good uncle to my care, ob&s;erving, that, though he was too fond of the world, he was one of the worthie&s;t per&s;ons in it. She then departed for the convent, which, indeed, almo&s;t joined to her uncle's hou&s;e, and I found that the ceremony would begin in two hours.</P>

<P>It is among&s;t the &s;olemn maxims of my life, never to rea&s;on with a man in this kind of &s;ituation. One may as well talk of &s;obriety to an intoxicated per&s;on, as of patience and re&s;ignation, or the folly of grieving, to a mind overborne by &s;orrow. The Convent-bell arous'd him, and &s;till holding my hand, (his
<PB N="183" REF="194">own trembling as he &s;poke)&mdash;Hark! the poor Fanchette's funeral-bell tolls!&mdash;we mu&s;t be going! I obeyed in &s;ilence. A great multi|tude were waiting in the antichamber of the convent: but by favor, and by intere&s;t, (both which have their effect, even in the temples devoted to tho&s;e who have <HI>renounced</HI> the <HI>world,</HI>) we were immediately admitted into the gal|lery, and obtained &s;eats that commanded the chapel, wherein the ceremony was to be per|formed. Indeed our places were directly in front of the very part where the &s;i&s;ters were to take their &s;tation.</P>
<P>Only two of the Novices were in the Chapel, and tho&s;e were &s;trewing the floor with fre&s;h|gathered flowers, and ever-greens; and at that end of the apartment where the chief objects of the day were to be di&s;played, was a large piece of green carpeting. Soon after the&s;e preliminary preparations, which have all their effect on the mind, as tending to inflate curio&s;ity, the ceremonies of the entrance, (which were not a little impo&s;ing likewi&s;e,) began. Fir&s;t came in the &s;uperior of the convent, then the nuns, according to their order, and then the two &s;i&s;ters, who were conducted by two &s;i&s;ters, to a little altar in the centre of the room, &s;eparated from the gal|lery, <PB N="184" REF="195">only by a &s;light and open partition. I&s;abel, &s;o was the elder &s;i&s;ter named, was placed on the right, and Fanchette on the left. We had a complete view of both. Each had a lighted taper in her hand, and their head|dre&s;&s;es were di&s;tingui&s;hed by the blue hood, and the white. There was enough of family &s;imilitude left in their features to di&s;cover their relation&s;hip: It had been much &s;tronger, but the re&s;emblance was, in great mea&s;ure, dimi|ni&s;hed by their oppo&s;ite &s;ituations in life. I&s;abel had now been twelve months in a man|ner <HI>out of the world,</HI> and in the practi&s;e of all the au&s;terities of the Carmelite order; and, though the&s;e are not &s;o rigid as &s;ome others, the regulations they pre&s;cribe are more than &s;ufficient to take out of the cheek that bloom, which human &s;ociety, nature, and the heart, &s;o liberally be&s;tow upon youth: be&s;ides which, I&s;abel had &s;omething of a con&s;titutional pale, corre&s;ponding to the pen&s;ive colour of her mind,&mdash;if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf. Fan|chette, on the contrary, although &s;he had yielded to a &s;entiment that determined her to devote her&s;elf, had too recently taken her <HI>leave</HI> of the world, and of the gay and fre&s;hning air it breathes&mdash;(in the country at lea&s;t,)&mdash;and was, moreover, by di&s;po&s;ition, &s;o impa&s;&s;ion'd, that the contra&s;t betwixt her and I&s;abel was the
<PB N="185" REF="196">more &s;triking. The eyes of both were extremely dark, but although tho&s;e of I&s;abel were (from the extingui&s;hed complexion of her cheeks,) more deep, and perhaps more intere&s;ting, than Fanchette's, they were of a more &s;ubdued and dying lu&s;tre: Fanchette's, were "as the radiance of the ri&s;en day", and her &s;i&s;ter's, as the parting beam of a &s;un, prema|turely clouded, even at noon.</P>
<P>On their reaching the altar, the &s;uperior of the men's convent addre&s;&s;ed the two &s;i&s;ters, in an exhortation replete with unaffected elo|quence, and to which they gave the mo&s;t fix'd attention. This done, I&s;abel, who was to take the veil, aro&s;e, and between two of the &s;i&s;ters, came forward to make her profe&s;&s;ion; which, though in Latin, was delivered with the mo&s;t admirable articulation, and cla&s;&s;ical propriety, kneeling before the Prie&s;t. Then followed the prayers appointed for the occa|&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Prie&s;t having laid the proper dre&s;&s;es of the order on a table before him, a&s;&s;orted them. Meantime, the &s;uperior took off the white, or noviciate veil, and enrobed I&s;abel in black, but over this under ve&s;tment was placed the white cloth cloak, and the neck and head dre&s;s
<PB N="186" REF="197">of black linen. A broad belt and the beads were then &s;ettled. The Prie&s;t dipp'd a bru&s;h in holy water, with which he &s;prinkled the Devo|tee: and during this ceremony, the mo&s;t &s;olemn airs were played on the organ, in which the profe&s;&s;ed join'd, apparently with her whole &s;oul. She was reconducted to her &s;eat, where &s;he remained at her devotions, while her &s;i&s;ter underwent the ceremonies of the Noviciate. The&s;e differ little from the other, except that &s;he was inve&s;ted with the white head cloth in&s;tead of the black.</P>
<P>But, previous to the a&s;&s;umption of the&s;e, &s;he delivered a box to the Prie&s;t, from which were taken the riche&s;t ornaments &s;he had made u&s;e of while in the world. The holy Father threw them on the floor with an air of di&s;dain, and with yet greater indignation Fanchette trampled them under her feet, as objects unworthy her future attention. In a former part of the ceremonials, while her &s;i&s;ter was putting on the eternal veil, I ob&s;erved that the before animated countenance of Fanchette became &s;uddenly pallid, but while &s;he was renouncing the&s;e her worldly ornaments, the blood &s;allied into her charming face, as if to give <HI>in</HI> a more powerful evidence of her entire di&s;avowal of all the pomps and vanities of
<PB N="187" REF="198">life. And now &s;ucceeded &s;everal grand, and truly &s;pirit-&s;tirring choru&s;&s;es, of Prie&s;ts, Nuns, and of the congregation. High ma&s;s was next performed in the body of the convent below. This pageant, with all its prie&s;tly ornaments, tingling of bells, and the &s;educing apparatus of incen&s;e and of &s;acrifice, are &s;o well known, and have been &s;o well de&s;cribed by various authors, that I &s;hall pa&s;s on to more new and intere&s;ting objects. Among&s;t the&s;e your heart will di&s;tingui&s;h the two &s;incere and &s;orrow-&s;truck lovers of the&s;e beau|teous victims. Both were pre&s;ent; the one in the vain hope of prevailing on Fanchette, even while at the altar, to change her cruel re&s;olution; the other to attempt this al&s;o, or at wor&s;t to enjoy the afflicting luxury of <HI>&s;eeing</HI> this I&s;abel tear her&s;elf from his hope for ever; not, as I was informed, without a faint idea of the po&s;&s;ibility that the &s;udden &s;ight of <HI>him</HI> whom &s;he had once fondly loved, might change her vow, in the&s;e the la&s;t moments of her power, to con&s;ecrate it to love in&s;tead of reli|gion. The&s;e young men were both of re&s;pecta|ble connexions, of decent fortunes, and of blamele&s;s characters: the name of I&s;abel's lover was Bernard, and that of Fanchette, Lacrew.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="199">They had both placed them&s;elves &s;o as per|fectly to &s;ee; but only one of them to be &s;een by the beloved object. Lacrew relied upon an open attack, and, therefore, kept con&s;tantly in view of the fair citadel; Bernard conceived more hope from an ambu&s;cade, and, therefore, by way of ma&s;ked battery, entrenched him&s;elf behind a pillar on one &s;ide of the gallery, from whence he could make a &s;ortie at the moment he judged mo&s;t favourable. His motive for thus attempting to carry the place by &s;urpri&s;e was &s;trong; he had been extremely ill, and I&s;abel, to whom a report had been made of it, had rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e <HI>her&s;elf</HI> the cau&s;e, particularly as his &s;ickne&s;s increa&s;ed from the day, that, (in reply to his &s;tronge&s;t urgency, to &s;pare his life while yet in her power,) &s;he had <HI>refu&s;ed,</HI> but, confe&s;&s;ed to a confidential friend, that, though &s;he felt more emotion at the account of his di&s;tre&s;s than &s;he <HI>ought</HI> to do, &s;he could not &s;uffer him to work her from her pious purpo&s;e. But the per&s;on who carried this account to him, conveyed it, in the <HI>u&s;ual way of &s;ecrets,</HI> to another confidential friend, who depo&s;ited it, in <HI>&s;olemn tru&s;t al&s;o,</HI> to a third, who, with the <HI>like &s;acred injunction,</HI> communicated it to Bernard him&s;elf; and although this report, at the time that it indicated &s;ome remains of
<PB N="189" REF="200">feeling for him, denoted her re&s;olution to &s;eclude her&s;elf for ever from his &s;ight, by an act, which, as before ob&s;erved, would put it beyond her power to make him happy, he conceived from it, (what cannot lovers ima|gine?) that, &s;ince &s;he was thus arous'd to &s;ome &s;en&s;ibility of his &s;ufferings, only at a <HI>de&s;cription</HI> of them, how would it be called forth at the unexpected <HI>&s;ight</HI> of a once beloved and now agonized object, whom &s;he had every rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e in his &s;ick chamber, at the di&s;tance of thirty leagues? he re&s;ided at the farthe&s;t part of the country of Juliers, and &s;he had every rea&s;on to imagine he was unable to leave his room. And &s;o indeed, except to accompli&s;h an atchievement of <HI>de&s;peration,</HI> he was.</P>
<P>But tho&s;e who have ever felt the influence of the faire&s;t hope, in the moment almo&s;t of &s;uch de&s;peration, will not wonder that the poor Bernard, in oppo&s;ition to the advice of his medical, and other friends, and even of his own weakne&s;s at other times, now found him|&s;elf &s;trong enough to leave an apartment, wherein he had, in a manner, been bed-ridden &s;everal weeks, and to throw him&s;elf not only into the open air, but into an open po&s;t-wag|gon, as they here call the public-&s;tage, and
<PB N="190" REF="201">which, (being without windows, and unde|fended from wind or weather, and very ab&s;urd|ly con&s;tructed,) is a <HI>di&s;ea&s;e in it&s;elf.</HI> He gain'd the village of the convent, it &s;eems, late in the evening that preceded the morn&icirc;ng, "big with the fate" of his heart: yet, that heart prompted him to take a moonlight view of the out&s;ide of the convent, which contained his trea&s;ure. He appear'd not to have &s;uffer'd from the&s;e exertions, or, at lea&s;t, the &s;uffrance and agitation <HI>within</HI> ab&s;orb'd every external di&s;|a&s;ter for the moment; &s;o true is the remark of our great ma&s;ter of human nature, that,
<Q><L>"&mdash;When the Mind's free,</L>
<L>"The Body's delicate".&mdash;</L></Q> and this unhappy lover might ju&s;tly exclaim with old Lear in the &s;torm,
<Q><L>"The tempe&s;t in <HI>my</HI> mind</L>
<L>"Doth from my &s;en&s;es take all feeling el&s;e</L>
<L>"Save what beats there:</L>
<L>"For where the greater malady is fix'd,</L>
<L>"The le&s;&s;er is &s;carce felt.</L></Q></P>
<P>Lacrew, who lived in the village, and was almo&s;t a next door neighbour, had le&s;s occa&s;ion for &s;tratagem; and having had almo&s;t daily denials from his mi&s;tre&s;s, was more reconciled even to the lo&s;s of her; not without a mental re&s;ource, however, that he firmly believed a
<PB N="191" REF="202">woman of her di&s;po&s;ition, would &s;oon &s;icken of a mona&s;tic life, and that long before her year of trial had pa&s;t, &s;he would return to the world, and of cour&s;e to him; for &s;he profe&s;&s;ed to love him better than any thing <HI>in</HI> that world: yet &s;he fancied &s;omething yet dearer to her <HI>out</HI> of it.</P>
<P>Her lover, indeed, expected, as he after|wards acknowledged to me and the uncle, that &s;he would, even during the ceremonies of ini|tiation, find &s;omething in them too formidable for the gaiety of her character, e&s;pecially if he placed him&s;elf full in her view. In this, how|ever, he was mi&s;taken. His mi&s;tre&s;s had him almo&s;t the whole time under her eye, but &s;eldom looked towards him, and when &s;he did, &s;he withdrew her&s;elf with an ha&s;te and re&s;olution, that confounded and chagrined her admirer.</P>
<P>The &s;i&s;ters having gone through the accus|tomed ceremonies, ro&s;e from their kneel|ing attitude, and retiring &s;ome paces back, each threw her&s;elf with a determined earne&s;t|ne&s;s, but not in the mockery of tragic vio|lence, at full length upon the carpet, and on their faces, and, had this falling &s;cene been in rehear&s;al actually on the &s;tage, by the mo&s;t expert tumblers, and po&s;ture ma&s;ters and
<PB N="192" REF="203">mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Theatre for &s;ix weeks, it could not have been more adroitly perform'd. Thus humbled to the ground, they imprinted on it an audible ki&s;s to expre&s;s their lowline&s;s of &s;pirit; and to &s;ignify they had renounced the lofty follies of the world, to who&s;e pomps and vanities they were henceforth dead: the better to carry on which idea, two of the nuns, the one in her noviciate, the other in her veil'd &s;tate, toll'd the pa&s;&s;ing-bell, even while the bodies of the &s;i&s;ters, thus &s;ymbolically buried alive, were cover'd with a pall, as if the breath of life was really gone from them.</P>
<P>It was at this intere&s;ting and awful moment, that the lover of I&s;abel broke from his con|cealment, and &s;hewed to the a&s;toni&s;hed &s;pec|tators a countenance, in which was painted every pa&s;&s;ion of the heart in de&s;pair: but he did not &s;peak.</P>
<P>The burial-&s;ervice was chanted to the notes of the organ, which, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the vocal powers of the prie&s;ts, nuns, &amp;c. might be truly &s;aid to enter the &s;pirit and elevate the &s;oul. It was impo&s;&s;ible for an Engli&s;h auditor, whom the Gods have made &s;omewhat poetical, not to apply to the occa&s;ion the beautiful de&s;cription
<PB N="193" REF="204">of Pope; and for an in&s;tant, not to adopt the doctrine it inculcates:
<Q><L>"O grace &s;erene! O virtue heavenly fair!</L>
<L>"Divine oblivion of low-thoughted care!</L>
<L>"Fre&s;h blooming hope, gay daughter of the Sky!</L>
<L>"And faith, our early immortality,</L>
<L>"Enter each mild, each amiable gue&s;t,</L>
<L>"Receive, and wrap me in eternal re&s;t!</L></Q>
The whole congregation were indeed extre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ly affected at this part of the ceremony. I was touch'd even to tears. As the veil'd I&s;abel ro&s;e, her eye &s;ettled for an in&s;tant on Bernard, who had pre&s;&s;ed forward by this time through the croud, and &s;tood with his face directly parallel to his mi&s;tre&s;s, who might be almo&s;t &s;aid to ri&s;e from the dead. Con&s;idering cir|cum&s;tances, he mu&s;t to <HI>her</HI> appear in nearly the &s;ame &s;ituation, and the &s;en&s;ation might have been &s;omething like what we may &s;uppo&s;e affected William, when Margaret's gho&s;t &s;tood at his feet.</P>
<P>And now it was I&s;abel di&s;covered that human nature was not yet extinct in her, and that all the imagination of Pope was converted into truths which &s;hook her frame, and ago|nized her heart.
<Q><L>"What means this tumult in a ve&s;tal's veins,</L>
<L>"Why rove my thoughts beyond this la&s;t retreat,</L>
<L><PB N="194" REF="205">"Why feels my heart its long forgotten heat?</L>
<L>"Yet, yet I love!"</L></Q> The&s;e que&s;tions, and this an&s;wer, certainly &s;ucceeded each other in her bo&s;om in the lan|guage of nature, though not expre&s;&s;ed in numbers.</P>
<P>It was plain to &s;ee&mdash;
<Q>"She had not yet forgot her&s;elf to &s;tone".</Q> Bernard was quick-&s;ighted enough, in the mid&s;t of his grief, to perceive this, and attempted to turn it to his advantage. Abe|lard him&s;elf, could not with more addre&s;s have "oppo&s;ed him&s;elf to heaven", or more dexterou&s;ly a&s;&s;i&s;ted "rebel nature to hold out half her heart". Though from what followed, you will &s;ee Bernard had not, like the above-mentioned lover, the power,
<Q>"To teach her 'twas no &s;in to love".</Q> it was manife&s;t, neverthele&s;s,
<Q>"Back through the paths of plea&s;ing &s;ea&s;e &s;he run".</Q> and it is no le&s;s certain, for the in&s;tant, that
<Q>"Not on the cro&s;s her eyes were fix'd"</Q> but on <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>Yet though thus a&s;&s;ailed by the unexpected view of, as <HI>&s;he</HI> thought, an expiring lover,
<PB N="195" REF="206">and at a time when every principle, and every feeling of her &s;oul had &s;urmounted trials, which required every <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;tance</HI> from &s;urround|ing objects, rather than to find among&s;t them, wherewithal to <HI>di&s;tre&s;s</HI> her, (in, perhaps, the only vulnerable part&mdash;her pity for the mi&s;ery, of which &s;he might well &s;uppo&s;e her&s;elf the occa&s;ion,)&mdash;although, I &s;ay, the&s;e &s;trong events, might, for a &s;hort time,
<Q>"Blot out each bright idea of the &s;kies".</Q> far from indulging in the oblivious draughts of pa&s;&s;ion, or reiterating the loo&s;e imagery of Eloi&s;a, or avowing with her that
<Q><L>"From the full choir when loud Ho&s;annas ri&s;e,</L>
<L>"And &s;well the pomp of dreadful &s;acrifice,</L>
<L>"Love found an altar for forbidden fires".</L></Q> The tran&s;itory terror, tenderne&s;s, alarm, or &s;orrow, which &s;he felt at the &s;ight of poor Bernard, at &s;uch a time, in &s;uch a place, might well claim ab&s;olution, if not a&s;&s;ent, from the power who had ju&s;t received her vows.
<Q><L>"Devotion's &s;elf might &s;teal a thought from heaven,</L>
<L>"One human tear might drop, and be forgiven!"</L></Q> She did not long, however, &s;uffer the once dear object of her love, to "di&s;pute her heart", which, a&s;&s;uredly, a life pa&s;t in cha&s;tity and inno|cence, long before &s;he dedicated it to her God, had rendered more acceptable than that who&s;e
<PB N="196" REF="207">&s;uppo&s;ed effu&s;ions, the poet has &s;o enchant|ingly poured forth.</P>
<P>After &s;he had gazed about half a minute, in which &s;hort &s;pace more was painted in the face, that at any former period of my life I had &s;een, though the work of hours, &s;he clos'd her fine and humid eyes with a fortitude, which might have induced the angels to &s;anction the momentary and human &s;ympathy, which had bathed them with tears, but &s;he was unable to repre&s;s one gentle &s;igh, the weight of which was felt by my whole heart as it i&s;&s;ued from her very lovely lips. Whether it was the &s;igh tender, or penitential, the &s;igh of regret for the &s;ufferings of her lover, or of &s;elf-reproach for having allowed it to e&s;cape,&mdash;it was the mo&s;t graceful, mo&s;t penetrating I have ever known. It will heave for ever in my memory, and I&s;abel's face was, (on her ri&s;ing from the ground) &s;o near me, that I &s;tood within the very breath of it. Had I not frequently &s;een that the gaye&s;t minds and manners take, with occa&s;ion, a more firm and &s;olemn ca&s;t, than tho&s;e from who&s;e general gravity one <HI>expects</HI> the mo&s;t fix'd and unmoved conduct, I &s;hould have been &s;urpri&s;ed at the unaltered mein of Fanchette, who, though more airy, more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ely an inhabitant of the world, and who
<Q><PB N="197" REF="208">
"warm in youth, had bid that world farewell."</Q> (her approved lover &s;till before her, exhibiting him&s;elf in the mo&s;t pity-moving attitudes,) Fanchette relaxed nothing of her attention to the bu&s;ine&s;s or duty of the day. On the contrary, her look to I&s;abel denoted all the admonitory council, which the moral echoes, or, as the Poet calls them, <HI>more</HI> than echoes
<Q>"talk'd along the walls."</Q> Eloi&s;a could never have heard, or fancy that &s;he heard, the hollow &s;ound from the &s;hrine, more di&s;tinctly than I thought I perceived the <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> of that &s;ound in the charming features of this lovely girl:
<Q><L>"Come &s;i&s;ter come, they &s;aid or &s;eem'd to &s;ay</L>

<L>But all is calm in our eternal &s;leep,</L>
<L>Here grief forgets to groan, and love to weep,</L>
<L>Ev'n &s;uper&s;tition lo&s;es ev'ry fear,</L>
<L>For God, not man, ab&s;olves our frailties here."</L></Q> How applicable to the occa&s;ion! Nor was it long ere I&s;abel, as if the&s;e ver&s;es had actually been recited, illu&s;trated tho&s;e which follow them, in the celebrated epi&s;tle of the lovers of Paraclete,
<Q><L>"I come, I come, prepare your ro&s;eate bowers,</L>
<L>"Cele&s;tial palms and ever-blooming flowers.</L>
<L>"How happy is the blamele&s;s ve&s;tal's lot, &amp;c.</L></Q>
<PB N="198" REF="209">Not &s;o the lovers:&mdash;Bernard, after a long &s;truggle with his heart, exclaimed, in &s;ad and broken accents&mdash;Ah God!&mdash;Ah God! and ran out of the convent; nor was it long ere his example was followed by Lacrew.</P>
<P>The ceremonies, thus interrupted, were &s;oon re&s;umed. The &s;i&s;ter-votaries were re-conducted to their chairs, where both joined in the prayers mo&s;t devoutly.</P>
<P>And now the holy wafers were given, and the &s;olemnities of the Catholic church in the &s;acrament began. The&s;e ended, the &s;i&s;ters ro&s;e, ki&s;&s;ed the robes of the prie&s;t, bowed them&s;elves before the Crucifix, embraced each other; then the &s;uperior, the nuns, noviciates, and pen&s;ioners, all of whom were received with &s;miles, that &s;eraphs &s;eemed to have a&s;&s;i&s;ted, while a dozen hand&s;ome girls, re&s;idents for a convent education, &s;trewed flowers over them, as they advanced to the la&s;t ceremony, namely, that of <HI>crowning,</HI> emblematic of <HI>that crown of glory,</HI> with which we are a&s;&s;ured the good are to be di&s;tingui&s;hed in the world to come.</P>
<P>By way of &s;upplementary matter, it is to be noted, that the ceremony was performed on the birth-day of the veiled &s;i&s;ter, a circum&s;tance
<PB N="199" REF="210">that gave it additional &s;olemnity. The re&s;t of this aweful day was pa&s;t, agreeable to cu&s;tom, in all manner of innocent fe&s;tivity; by way of te&s;tifying that &s;o far from feeling any regret for having renounced the world, the &s;en&s;ations were in uni&s;on with the ceremonies; and, in|deed (had it not been for the affair of the heart in the ca&s;es of the two luckle&s;s lovers) I &s;hould believe that cu&s;tom and example had their u&s;ual effect, in conjunction with zeal and imagination, to make a mona&s;tic life preferable to every other, in the e&s;timate of the inhabi|tants of the convent. What confirms me the rather in this is, that the year following, being at the &s;elf-&s;ame mona&s;tery, I beheld the &s;elf|&s;ame Fanchette, after her twelve probationary months' re&s;idence, volunteer the &s;ame &s;ort of ceremony, and with the &s;ame apparent &s;atis|faction, and, though &s;he had lo&s;t &s;ome of tho&s;e complexional ro&s;es, which &s;eem to bloom be&s;t in the world, &s;he had gained more of tho&s;e lillies, which never fail to grow in the cheeks of a nun, either from &s;eclu&s;ion, or &s;everity, or a mixture of both. There was an air of pecu|liar content in Fanchette, at this <HI>confirmation</HI> of the choice &s;he had made in the beginning of the former year; nor was there le&s;s &s;atis|faction in the countenance of I&s;abel: in &s;hort, the mo&s;t &s;crutinizing eye might have a&s;&s;ured
<PB N="200" REF="211">the heart, the&s;e two &s;i&s;ters, in changing their plan of life, had only varied, not dimini&s;hed, their happine&s;s.</P>
<P>On bidding them (as probably it will prove) an everla&s;ting adieu, at this &s;econd vi&s;it to their convent, I borrowed once more an applicable pa&s;&s;age from our great poet, and I cannot but believe every line found its echo in the minds of the beautiful devotees. Nor do I think, &s;ince the epi&s;tle of Eloi&s;a was written, there can have happened &s;uch an exact illu&s;tration of its be&s;t, and mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;entiments; &s;ince, in the &s;i&s;ter nuns, were demon&s;trated all the &s;pirit, the &s;oftne&s;s, and the beauty of Abelard's mi&s;tre&s;s, without any of her cupidity, &s;en&s;u|ality, and libertini&s;m; and the exqui&s;ite apo|&s;trophe which follows was the work only of fancy in Eloi&s;a, but of feeling in I&s;abel and Fanchette.</P>
<Q><L>"How happy is the blamele&s;s ve&s;tal's lot,</L>

<P>Since my fir&s;t idea of poetical excellence, my &s;en&s;es and my heart have atte&s;ted the beauty of this pa&s;&s;age, and, indeed, of the whole poem; but never has it been &s;o impre&s;&s;ive as &s;ince the above-de&s;cribed incidents.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the whole, however, of the fa&s;cina|tion, I could not but notice a &s;mall &s;pice of worldly vanity, in certain parts of the cere|mony, &s;uch as one of the <HI>poor lowly</HI> brothers being appointed to place the embroidered robes of the <HI>High</HI> Prie&s;t over the <HI>backs of the chairs,</HI> to give them a more graceful flow, as the wearer &s;at down. I ob&s;erved, al&s;o, methought, &s;omething of earthly pageantry lurking in the <HI>caution</HI> with which the female veil, whether white or black, was <HI>fixed before,</HI> and <HI>folded behind;</HI> as well as in the attention to graceful po&s;ture, with which the profe&s;&s;ed threw her|&s;elf on the carpet; for, though, as I before &s;aid, it did not partake of the nature of a the|atrical exhibition, it had the air of having been a little &s;tudied, becau&s;e it was impo&s;&s;ible
<PB N="202" REF="213">not to &s;ee that &s;ome care had been taken that the ve&s;tal garment might pre&s;erve an intere&s;ting negligence: but when we con&s;ider that the &s;ame kind of regard to attitude and po&s;ition was betrayed by the dying Pompey, we may certainly allow it to two fine young women, who gave up, <HI>for ever,</HI> the conque&s;ts of their charms, at a period of life, when victory mo&s;t &s;olicited them. And, after all, their attentions to external finery were but the <HI>a&s;hes of human vanity</HI>&mdash;a few remaining &s;parks, that ju&s;t &s;hewed them&s;elves, and were then extingui&s;hed for ever.</P>
<P>The co&s;t of the fe&s;tival is always defrayed by the nun, or novice, and the friends, rela|tions, and a few cho&s;en prie&s;ts from the neigh|bouring convent, compo&s;ed the gue&s;ts. To this eating and drinking &s;cene, a little ma&s;|querade, in which all the nuns are allowed to a&s;&s;ume borrowed characters, en&s;ues. This done, the gue&s;ts retire, &s;uch I mean as are not of the convent. The religious withdraw to their cells, and the next morning re-com|mence tho&s;e duties, which know no rece&s;s throughout the revolving year, till a &s;imilar occa&s;ion produces a &s;imilar jubilee.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="214">It was a &s;ad and &s;orrowful day for the uncle of the&s;e &s;i&s;ters; he endured not to remain in an hou&s;e &s;tripped of its chief ornaments and a&s;&s;ociates, and which had the further <HI>d&eacute;&s;agr&eacute;|ment</HI> of &s;tanding, as before noted, in full view of the convent, which he con&s;idered as at once the pri&s;on and the tomb of his relations. In a few weeks, therefore, he removed to another part of the country, where he &s;till bears about
<Q>"A di&s;contented and repining &s;pirit."</Q></P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXVII. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>ADJOINING the little &s;igniories of Boxmeer, is the plea&s;ant country of Cuych
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herman de Cuych gave name to this country in 1058. John, the &s;on of Wennemaer yielded it, long after, in exchange of other territories, to William of Guelderland; but, at length, the Dukes of Burgundy becoming proprietors, they united it to Brabant. After this again, it was given as a pledge to the Count of Buren, who&s;e only daughter and heire&s;s married William of Orange, in 1551. Thus it was that the charming Caych country became annexed to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Prince Stadtholders.</NOTE>, a &s;mall, but productive territory, once in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Spain, but now a part of what is
<PB N="204" REF="215">called the Generality, a country &s;ubject to the Prince of Orange, and an object worth gleaning. It may be about the &s;ize of Hertford&s;hire, and is, like that, replete with unpretending graces. You would feel its re&s;emblance to England, even more clo&s;ely than the other parts of We&s;t|phalia&mdash;the &s;ame plea&s;ant pathways, mean|dring through cornfields&mdash;the &s;ame &s;oft pa&s;tu|rage&mdash;mode&s;t ri&s;ings&mdash;humble and flowery hedge-rows&mdash;the woods and cop&s;es filled with the &s;ame kind of birds&mdash;the river Meu&s;e no le&s;s fertili&s;ing than the Thames, nor le&s;s beautiful&mdash; the &s;ame &s;ort of whited cottages, mo&s;s and hou&s;eleek growing over the thatch.</P>
<P>If a footpath and river-bank traveller is di&s;po&s;ed, occa&s;ionally, to &s;urvey this country, he will find a thou&s;and beautiful &s;cenes, which crouds had never yet to boa&s;t.</P>
<P>It is extremely plea&s;ant to trace, as one journeys on, the&s;e &s;imilitudes and di&s;&s;imilitudes of one's native land; here recogni&s;ing, in cer|tain objects, our old acquaintance; there pay|ing, in others, our fir&s;t &s;alutation to entire
<PB N="205" REF="216">&s;trangers; and whether the&s;e happen to be of the vegetable or animal world, a tree, a flower, a wood, a meadow, a &s;tream, a river, a flock, an herd, a cottage, or its inhabitants, the gene|rous heart extends to greet whatever has de|lighted him at home, or entertained him abroad.</P>
<P>In turning over a little corner in my tra|velling writing-ca&s;e, I find a &s;mall bundle of papers, &s;uper&s;cribed materials for a <HI>&s;crap letter,</HI> which is to con&s;i&s;t of various minute Gleanings, too in&s;ignificant to &s;tand alone, but which, col|lected and tied together, may be of &s;ome value. After the <HI>long</HI> ears of corn have been gathered, you have &s;een the patient Gleaners return from the field, with a few hands-full, not of &s;tem or &s;ub&s;tance to be bound with the re&s;t of the &s;heaves, and yet too good to be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>To the&s;e minutiae, therefore, I &s;hall con|&s;ecrate the remainder of the pre&s;ent letter, de|&s;iring you will indulge them with the favour by which you have di&s;tingui&s;hed the re&s;t.</P>
<P>In Holland, We&s;tphalia, Germany, and their dependencies, it is cu&s;tomary for the common trade&s;men and &s;ervants to drop their &s;abots, &s;lippers, or &s;hoes, at the thre&s;hold of
<PB N="206" REF="217">the apartment, where their employers, ma&s;ters, or mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, are &s;itting, and pad along, with a trembling &s;ort of circum&s;pection, as if in fear of leaving a plebeian mark of their foot&s;teps behind them. And at every word you &s;peak, their hats, whether in the hou&s;e, or the open air, are &s;o painfully doffed, and pinched by their veneration, or their cu&s;tom, that I have a thou&s;and times &s;milingly put their hats on their heads, and reque&s;ted they would con&s;ider a good rub of their &s;hoes at the door-way was a &s;ufficient pa&s;&s;port to any room wherein they might be introduced to me: but the habit or civility is inveterate, and I verily believe they would pay the &s;ame homage to the empty apartments, had they occa&s;ion to enter them, in ab&s;ence of their &s;uppo&s;ed &s;uperiours. I re|peat that I am no advocate for indi&s;criminate familiarities, nor for Republican rudene&s;&s;es, but I love the poor, at lea&s;t as well as the rich, and I feel my&s;elf, as an individual of a maje&s;tic &s;pecies, humbled in <HI>their</HI> degradation. I would have them &s;ubordinate, becau&s;e I think &s;ociety demands its cla&s;&s;es, but I cannot endure they &s;hould be &s;ervile: and, after all, it is often affected, for &s;ometimes I have, at a &s;econd or third Gleaning of the&s;e bowing, bare-headed and footed gentlemen and ladies, found, heard, of &s;een them as &s;aucy, proud and vain-glorious,
<PB N="207" REF="218">as if they knew how to de&s;cend from their heights only to promote their intere&s;ts, in the hope of over-reaching you in a mi&s;erable &s;ous or &s;tiver.</P>
<P>In each of the above countries you will be obliged, as before ob&s;erved, to have one man to dre&s;s the hair on your head, my good reader, and another, (if peradventure thou art of the bearded &s;ex), to &s;crape it from thy face. But the la&s;t mentioned per&s;onage, whom they call &s;urgeon, is every where &s;o in&s;ufferably vain, formal, and <HI>mal adroit,</HI> that a penny barber in England does his bu&s;ine&s;s ten times better, and twenty times more expeditiou&s;ly. The Conti|nental &s;haver, whether Dutch, We&s;tphalian, or German, is one quarter of an hour bringing his in&s;truments of &s;urgery out of his pocket and arranging them; another in the apparatus of wipeing, whetting, &s;etting, and proving upon his hand, before he puts the razor on your chin; another in the operation, and at lea&s;t the fourth quarter in putting his &s;urgical matters up again, and all this you mu&s;t go through patiently or wor&s;e will follow; every re&s;i&s;tance co&s;ts you a drop of blood, remon&s;trance is not even li&s;tened to, and a reque&s;t of ha&s;te is a &s;lice from your chin, or a ga&s;h in your throat. I have had more rea&s;on to bewail a nervous
<PB N="203" REF="219">complaint that &s;hakes my hand, &s;ince I came into the&s;e countries than ever. I certainly mangle my&s;elf deliciou&s;ly whenever I attempt to atchieve this daily labour my&s;elf; but I yield to the pedantry of the&s;e executioners, only becau&s;e I con&s;ider being murdered by the hand of another is better than &s;hedding my own blood; as it is le&s;s heinous, you know, to &s;uffer a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination than to commit &s;uicide.</P>
<P>Seriou&s;ly, it is a mo&s;t provoking and clum&s;y operation abroad, and I have as often wi&s;hed my&s;elf beardle&s;s, as I might once have wi&s;hed the contrary. And as to any <HI>con&s;ideration</HI> that the head or face, the&s;e &s;urgeon-barbers have in hand, is human, a butcher, who might chu&s;e to &s;have the chops of a bullock, before he &s;laughtered it, would be more gentle. Your barber-&s;urgeon pinches you by the no&s;e with as little remor&s;e as a farrier draws the nippers round the no&s;trils of an hor&s;e! he &s;queezes your head as if he was binding up your brains, after a contu&s;ion; and holds back your neck, as if he was going to cut your throat, which, indeed, he generally does, in proof of his great powers of pharmacy. In a word, ble&s;&s;ed are tho&s;e ladies who happen to have no beards, and happy tho&s;e ladies or gentlemen, who when they travel can operate upon them&s;elves!</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="220">In almo&s;t every great road town upon the German Continent you will find an Engli&s;h &s;hop, where you may be &s;upplied with Engli&s;h manufacture. There is a very excellent one at the Hague, kept by Mr. M'Queen, which may almo&s;t be termed an <HI>univer&s;al warehou&s;e of Briti&s;h commodities.</HI> It is true you pay &s;ome|what high for the&s;e, but you are to con&s;ider fir&s;t their &s;uperior excellence; &s;econdly, the hazard, lo&s;s, and expence of their tran&s;porta|tion; and, thirdly, it &s;hould be noted, that as the Dutch and German cu&s;tomers buy almo&s;t every thing <HI>for life;</HI> that is, make an expen&s;ive article la&s;t as long as <HI>they la&s;t them&s;elves,</HI> and pay bills about once in ten years, (when they conde&s;cend to pay at all; for no trade&s;man dare &s;end in his bill <HI>undemanded</HI>) if articles were not highly rated, an Engli&s;h trader abroad mu&s;t &s;tarve.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable, that the inns abroad kept by Engli&s;hmen, or people who &s;peak our lan|guage, are dearer than tho&s;e kept by natives, about fifty per cent. and it is remarkable, al&s;o, that the Engli&s;h landlords over-reach their countrymen more than a &s;tranger. See you avoid them. There are at lea&s;t &s;ix Scotch|men, and three Iri&s;hmen, to one trader Engli&s;h born, di&s;per&s;ed over foreign lands: <HI>the fir&s;t
<PB N="210" REF="221">thrive,</HI> the <HI>&s;econd live,</HI> the third <HI>barely exi&s;t.</HI> Can you account for this? The <HI>truth</HI> of the remark reaches from one end of the Continent to the other, with &s;carce an exception. I think I have found out the rea&s;on, but it might &s;eem invidious, and a prejudice to mention it.</P>
<P>There &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in &s;ome parts of Holland a curious circum&s;tance re&s;pecting divorces&mdash;an hu&s;band who is de&s;irous to obtain repo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of either an eloped, parted, or wandering wife, is to &s;end a written &s;ummons to her, inviting her company to bed and board; if &s;he refu&s;es, he is to go in a boat on the river Meu&s;e, to any di&s;tance he plea&s;es, then he is to call the &s;aid wife three &s;everal times, and if he receives no an&s;wer, or if &s;he does not appear, he is to come back, as fre&s;h and fair a batchelor as before he purcha&s;ed the wedding ring; and is at liberty to choo&s;e another mate, who&s;e hand he may accept after the publication of the banns and marriage ceremony. The truth of this almo&s;t incredible &s;tory, is too general to be di&s;puted by any body but tho&s;e who cannot believe what they have never &s;een. And yet there are numbers of my dear countrymen who will &s;uppo&s;e it a Gleaning of the author's imagination. To which I &s;hall only reply, that in the &s;mall town of the Brielle in Holland,
<PB N="211" REF="222">here are not le&s;s than half a dozen couples who have been thus re-married.</P>
<P>But as a celebrated traveller (Lady W. Montague) ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, we travellers are in very hard circum&s;tances. If we &s;ay nothing but what has been &s;aid before us, we are dull, and we have ob&s;erved nothing: If we tell any thing new we are laughed at as fabulous and romantic, not allowing for change of company, or of cu&s;toms that happen every twenty years in every country; or remain fixed for ever, though, perhaps, not before noticed. The ceremonies attending vi&s;itings, and burial con|dolences, de&s;erve mention. In Pru&s;&s;ian We&s;t|phalia, a letter is &s;ent by the &s;urvivor inform|ing the friends of the decea&s;ed that &s;uch a rela|tion has departed this life; but it is the etiquette <HI>not to reply.</HI> Your &s;ympathy is taken for granted; and thus, the affair is not only conveniently &s;hortened, but a great deal of trouble is &s;aved to both parties.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to vi&s;its, it is the e&s;tabli&s;hed punctilio for new comers to make the fir&s;t ad|vances to re&s;idents, exactly inverting the etiquette of England; and the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for this practice is, that new &s;ettlers may have the privilege of declining company &s;hould
<PB N="212" REF="223">they not wi&s;h for &s;ociety, or of extending or narrowing it &s;hould they de&s;ire acquaintance; your vi&s;it being always returned immediately, and if you do not vi&s;it in the cour&s;e of the fir&s;t month, it is pre&s;umed you prefer &s;olitude.</P>
<P>Perhaps this may be an improvement on the plan of England, where every one has free liberty to gratify curio&s;ity, often at the expence of real courte&s;y, for numbers go once for a well-bred &s;tare, drink their di&s;h of tea, and &s;hew they have had enough of you, by never cultivating you unle&s;s you happen exactly to &s;uit their ta&s;te, which is often the re&s;ult of their &s;ingularity, or caprice. Whereas, in the&s;e countries, you have lei&s;ure for previous enquiry; you can &s;elect your acquaintance, and if it is not of the be&s;t kind the place affords, it mu&s;t be your own fault.</P>
<P>Another inconvenience attending your not being fortified with the language of the country, whether Dutch or German, is the impo&s;ition you are liable to, e&s;pecially on leaving a town or hou&s;e, where you may have had any running accounts. The people you have dealt with pre|tend to under&s;tand <HI>you</HI> fully when you <HI>make</HI> your bargain; but when you come to collect your bills, they prote&s;t that you have mi&s;taken <HI>them;</HI> and this errour is always to their ad|vantage. <PB N="213" REF="224">For in&s;tance, you agree with a &s;urgeon-barber at &s;o much per month to &s;have you, and with a &s;hoe-boy to clean your boots, &amp;c. You rea&s;onably conclude the price &s;ettled between you includes every thing: but at the end of the month you are charged &s;o much for putting &s;oap on the face, and &s;o much for taking it off; &s;o much for rubbing away the du&s;t from your &s;hoes, and &s;o much again for blacking them. Let it be clearly &s;tated, there|fore, that, in your country, &s;having and &s;hoe cleaning mean what they expre&s;s.</P>
<P>The price of timber in We&s;tphalia, and the countries that environ it, is among&s;t the things calculated to &s;urpri&s;e an Engli&s;h traveller. A noble fir of between thirty and forty years growth, is thought rather dear at &s;ix florins, about ten &s;hillings Engli&s;h: and an oak of more than half a century, is rated at about twelve, or at the mo&s;t fifteen &s;hillings. Inferior wood in proportion. The birch tree is here found in abundance, and contributes much to the beauty of the country, drooping with an air of poetical melancholy, almo&s;t with as much elegant &s;adne&s;s as the weeping willow. The natives of We&s;tphalia tell you, that the juice is good to drink, the foliage good to &s;ee, and the branches good to burn: they &s;eem no le&s;s &s;en&s;ible than our&s;elves, al&s;o, that the twigs
<PB N="214" REF="225">have other virtues chiefly adapted for the u&s;e of nur&s;eries and &s;chools.</P>
<P>Simple curio&s;ity is alike in all countries. You remember the account I &s;ent you in my fir&s;t &s;heaf of the a&s;toni&s;hment of an whole family of Cambrian ru&s;tics, at the &s;ight of a &s;hining &s;teel watch-chain. I found a com|panion for this picture of <HI>wonderment</HI> in the &s;urpri&s;e of &s;ome We&s;tphalia cottagers, who &s;urveyed a common bamboo &s;tick with as much attention and awe, as if it was a wand of enchantment; and feeling the knots with a trembling hand, as if there was magic in every joint.</P>
<P>You will be plea&s;ed to hear the <HI>univer&s;al</HI> re|putation which is enjoyed by the manufactures of your country. I think I &s;lightly glanced at this &s;ubject before. Whatever is Engli&s;h be|comes every where abroad an object of admi|ration. I have witne&s;&s;ed this in various in&s;tances, but in none more than in the rhap&s;ody which the &s;ight of three pair of Eng|li&s;h &s;hoes produced in an hone&s;t cobler of a little town in Pru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>The&s;e articles, neat as imported from Lon|don, lay upon my table ju&s;t unpacked, as this
<PB N="215" REF="226">child of nature entered my room to receive orders for a trifling repair in my boots. He incontinently caught up one of the &s;hoes, and for &s;ome minutes was too much ab&s;orbed in wonder to &s;peak. He turned the &s;hoe about in &s;ilent admiration; felt the &s;ole, which his <HI>look</HI> denoted was of the be&s;t leather po&s;&s;ible&mdash; examined the &s;titching, the form, the ele|gance, the &s;olidity, the &s;implicity, the light|ne&s;s, the &s;traps, the quarters, &s;itted it to his hand; as he did which he &s;hewed &s;igns of the mo&s;t perfect approbation&mdash;then by way of compari&s;on, held it down to his own &s;hoe, and <HI>as</HI> he did &s;o, gave te&s;timony of the mo&s;t ine&s;&s;able contempt, even for his own perform|ance, which was, perhaps, the highe&s;t compli|ment that could be paid to the performance of another. His features, and action, had actually all the force of Hamlet's parallel of the old Fortinbras his father, and the u&s;urper:
<Q>"Look but on this picture and on this, &amp;c.!"</Q> His phi&s;iognomy te&s;tified that <HI>his</HI> work was no more to compare to the Briti&s;h Cri&s;pin's
<Q>"Than he to Hercules!"</Q> It was long before he could attend indeed to any thing re&s;pecting him&s;elf, and after his rhap&s;ody &s;ub&s;ided a little, he &s;eemed to under|take <PB N="216" REF="227">even the cobbling art of taking up a few loo&s;e &s;titches in an <HI>Engli&s;h boot</HI> with reluct|ance.</P>
<P>Nor does our country triumph in this handy|craft fame without the be&s;t-founded preten|&s;ions, &s;ince in every article of workman&s;hip we ca&s;t them at a di&s;tance that rather gives the &s;en&s;ation of de&s;pair than energy. Doors, win|dows, their ornaments, their nece&s;&s;aries, their comforts, their fini&s;hing, their application, their fitne&s;s, their buildings, their elegance, all yield the palm to the &s;uperior arts of the Briti&s;h artificer. And if there is a general rule without an exception, I am, from very long and diligent &s;crutiny, inclined to think it lies in the unrivalled excellence of our manu|factures in the comforts and conveniences of life.</P>
<P>You have heard numberle&s;s anecdotes of the late Pru&s;&s;ian monarch. A &s;tronger idea of his in&s;atiable military ambition cannot be well given, than in his exclaiming to one of his officers while &s;urveying the pro&s;pect from his chateau at Cleves; "very fine, to be &s;ure, noble woods, pretty gardens, fair towns, well-filled rivers, and all that, but I can never think it a good pro&s;pect while any part of the objects it includes is the property of another &s;overeign!"</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="228">I will ju&s;t note to you, that among&s;t the pictures of this chateau, is a very fine one of Je&s;us and the virgin, and on the rever&s;e, a full length portrait of the painter him&s;elf, &s;u&s;pended in the middle of the room to &s;hew at once the genius and the vanity of the man!</P>
<P>Of the German Theatre I have little to ob&s;erve, farther than that it excels in <HI>pa&s;&s;ion.</HI> You mu&s;t have often noted the defect of the Engli&s;h actors, (I &s;peak generally) when not immediately in di&s;cour&s;e or action in the &s;cene. They &s;eem to think that their character comes to a pau&s;e at the end of every &s;peech, and they wait for the cue words to re&s;ume it: the&s;e are no &s;ooner given, than they kindle in a moment. They wait the match and go off like a cracker. Then all is dead and inert, till the other per&s;onages have &s;ettled the bu&s;i|ne&s;s in hand, whether an affair of love, hate, hope, or de&s;pair; nor does the pa&s;&s;ive character they are &s;peaking to, ever interrupt the pro|gre&s;s of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, or &s;hew any &s;en&s;ibility thereof, except by &s;tepping a pace back, or a pace forward; by a &s;tamp of the foot, a thump of the brea&s;t, or a &s;mack of the forehead.&mdash;But on the Theatre Allemande all is life, vigour, and ardency: yet rarely over&s;tepping the mode&s;ty of nature; and the bye play is &s;o &s;kill|fully <PB N="218" REF="229">managed, that where the poet him&s;elf &s;leeps, the vigilance of the actor guarantees his nap, without any diminution of his poeti|cal fame.</P>
<P>I am aware that this is the ca&s;e, &s;ometimes, in the Briti&s;h theatre, but it is more rare; and commonly &s;peaking, Homer him&s;elf could not there nod, had Homer been a dramati&s;t, without &s;ome of the performers &s;lumbering with him, and cau&s;ing the audience to &s;lumber al&s;o.</P>
<P>High however, as they e&s;timate the manu|factures of Great Britain, the untravelled Pru&s;&s;ians and Germans appear to have but a very confined idea of its extent: for, in the fir&s;t place, many of them imagine, that it is rather nece&s;&s;ity, than choice; rather policy, than curio&s;ity, which takes &s;uch numbers out of England. They believe the population is too great for the place; that <HI>our</HI> little country being over&s;tocked, the &s;uperflux wander about the earth in &s;earch of <HI>more room.</HI> Almo&s;t every per&s;on tells you he knows an Engli&s;hman!&mdash; that is to &s;ay, in the cour&s;e of his life, every man has met with one of the Briti&s;h wan|derers, or, &s;ome &s;olitary family re&s;ident abroad. The Germans immediately pre&s;ume
<PB N="219" REF="230">this per&s;on, or family, mu&s;t be known al&s;o to <HI>you.</HI> If you an&s;wer in the negative, they won|der, which certainly implies a contracted idea of Great Britain as a territory, however they may think of it as a nation.</P>
<P>The Germans bring up their children with great tenderne&s;s, but in a manner to prevent the effects of effeminacy, or the ordinary ail|ments proceeding therefrom; I have &s;een the &s;ons and daughters of gentlemen run through the dews of the morning without &s;hoes, &s;tock|ings, or any under garments, but &s;hirts and &s;hifts: chacing each other round the court yards, gardens, &amp;c. in this <HI>almo&s;t</HI> natural &s;tate, after a night of ince&s;&s;ant rain. About noon, when there &s;eems the le&s;s real nece&s;&s;ity to wrap up, they begin to <HI>put on,</HI> ju&s;t in the proportion as other children <HI>throw off,</HI> but they all look as healthy as if they were educated in the way of England. The mothers of Great Britain will &s;hudder at this relation, yet, could the cu&s;tom be reconciled with decency, which &s;urely were ea&s;y, it might de&s;erve adoption. Colds and coughs, which are not only bad di&s;|orders in them&s;elves, but the parents of wor&s;e in England, are rarely heard of along the continent of Germany: And after you have turned your back on Holland, the gout begins to
<PB N="220" REF="231">lo&s;e his excruciating power, till, in advancing further north, he is, in a mea&s;ure, &s;ubdued; at lea&s;t, a victim bound hand and foot by this tyrant, who hourly brings &s;o many of my compatriots to the rack, is rarely &s;een. Mu&s;t we not impute this general exemption from one of the &s;harpe&s;t pangs to which our frailty is heir, to early expo&s;ure of the body and limbs to all the &s;kiey influences?</P>
<P>I think I have not yet mentioned the mode of &s;erving at table in Holland, and Pru&s;&s;ia. Vegetables are eaten fir&s;t, no per&s;on offers to begin till all are helped; meat comes next, this is cut into very thin &s;lices in a plate, and pa&s;&s;ing round the table, every one receives, or declines. If a &s;econd, third, fourth, or fifth &s;ort of meat is on the board, there are as many plates-full &s;ent round it,&mdash;the &s;ervant watches your gla&s;s, filling it when empty: the bread is cut into exceeding thin &s;lices, and no healths are drank except at parting.</P>
<P>An elegant Engli&s;h family &s;ettled in Holland, has lately given a <HI>Dutch drum</HI> or route, of which the lady of the hou&s;e has favoured me with a de&s;cription: As it is well told, and a curio&s;ity in it&s;elf, I will here pre&s;ent you with a Gleaning; and in her own words.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="232">"Dear Mr. Gleaner,</P>
<P>"At your de&s;ire, I am &s;itting down to give you a de&s;cription of what is called in this country, a <HI>contre vi&s;ite.</HI> That I might accom|modate to the cu&s;toms of the place, I invited the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a good natured Dutch neigh|bour, who helped me through all the ceremo|nials: And being no le&s;s a per&s;onage than the Burgoma&s;ter's wife, &s;he was wholly competent to the bu&s;ine&s;s. I &s;hall write in way of general direction, as to what is to be done, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>"Two of the large&s;t rooms in the hou&s;e are always appropriated to the occa&s;ion: the better if they communicate, as is indeed u&s;ual abroad, but that is not material. Card tables are to be &s;et in the four corners of each room; the middle being kept perfectly clear,&mdash;the place of honor is always determined to be on the right hand &s;ide of the pier gla&s;s. From each &s;ide of this gla&s;s you are to place two rows of chairs, with a &s;quare box called a &s;tove, at the foot of each chair; and, if in winter, you are to take care the&s;e &s;toves are well &s;upplied with burning turf, or rather with the live a&s;hes of turf; and, if in &s;ummer, the fire is to be omitted, as a Dutch woman is too much in the habit of canting up her legs on the&s;e abominable little foot&s;tools to &s;it
<PB N="222" REF="233">comfortably without them, and in the cold weather, &s;he could neither u&s;e her hands, or arms, without &s;moke-drying her feet.&mdash;By the gentlemen's &s;eats you place &s;pitting boxes; and, as if the&s;e would not hold enough, a dozen or two of &s;pitting pots are to be &s;et on the &s;ide tables, or to grace the corner of the card equipage: &s;everal &s;lates and pencils are al&s;o to be provided. All the plate you can mu&s;ter is to be crouded on the grand &s;ideboard, and at lea&s;t an hundred tobacco pipes, with ta&s;teful devices wrapp'd about them, not for|getting half a dozen pound boxes of tobacco, with a &s;uitable &s;ervice of &s;toppers.</P>
<P>"The&s;e preparations being &s;ettled, you are ready to receive the company, who begin to appear at your Dutch drum about <HI>five in the afternoon!</HI> The <HI>reigning</HI> burgoma&s;ter's wife enters fir&s;t. You are to receive her at the door, after a good run to meet her, (by way of te&s;tifying your joy) with a dead &s;top, and you are to take care that your curt&s;ey is at lea&s;t as profound as hers; the better if a little deeper. And if you would adopt the fa&s;hion of this country, you &s;hould revive one of your boarding &s;chool &s;inkings at the commencement of a minuet, or one of your &s;chool reverences to your governe&s;s on leaving the room. You are
<PB N="223" REF="234">to take her by the hand, you are to &s;ay you are extremely honoured by the vi&s;it, and then <HI>ki&s;s her three times!</HI> Then lead her to the right hand &s;ide of the gla&s;s,&mdash;order a burning, red|hot &s;tove to be put under her petticoats,&mdash;(the genteeler if you conde&s;cend to place it your|&s;elf,)&mdash;and then receive the re&s;t of the com|pany, <HI>&s;toveing</HI> them and <HI>ki&s;&s;ing</HI> in the &s;ame manner; more carefully however <HI>placing</HI> them according to their <HI>rank in the town or vil|lage,</HI> than if they were &s;o many Briti&s;h peer|e&s;&s;es to be &s;ettled by the High Steward, at the trial of a &s;i&s;ter peere&s;s for high Trea&s;on. When all the chairs are filled, you may order refre&s;hments.</P>
<P>"In the fir&s;t place, tea is to be pre&s;ented three times round the room. This over, the card tables are to be arranged, the &s;toves refre&s;hed, the pipes lighted, and the &s;pitting boxes begin to work. You are to pre&s;ent <HI>four kings</HI> to the burgoma&s;ter's wife, and the three you mean to play at her table. To the next lady, in her rank, you pre&s;ent the <HI>queens:</HI> But make a memorandum, that, when once &s;eated, nobody &s;tirs from her table till the party breaks up at ten o'clock, &s;o that you are fixed as a &s;tatue for almo&s;t five hours. The refre&s;hments are to be handed about every <HI>quarter of an hour,</HI> but
<PB N="224" REF="235">to vary, as to the collations. One quarter gives coffee, another wine, another liquors, another orgeat, and at every time the company eat and drink with unabated appetite; and tho&s;e who offer the mo&s;t good things of this world, are made the mo&s;t honorable mention of, in the annals of <HI>contre vi&s;iti&s;m.</HI> The ceremonies of taking leave are like tho&s;e of entrance.</P>
<P>"It is to be ob&s;erved, that when you give one of their vi&s;its it is not from your own invitation: the reigning burgoma&s;ter &s;ends you word, if convenient, he will come to you &s;uch a day. If you accept the challenge, you are to &s;end off your cards, in which you invite <HI>the town</HI> to meet him; who very obligingly obey the &s;ummons, whether they ever &s;aw you before or no; or whether they &s;hall ever &s;ee you again.</P>
<P>"All the &s;moking party keep their own room, but leave &s;uch a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of their orgies behind them, that it is nece&s;&s;ary your hou&s;e, (if your no&s;e is not a native of Holland,) &s;hould perform a quarantine of a month before it can be purified.</P>
<P>"A <HI>contre-vi&s;ite</HI> &s;eldom includes &s;upper, but when a &s;upper is to be given in Holland, it
<PB N="225" REF="236">always comprehends cards and tea, with the immen&s;e et cetera of about eight times coffee, as many cakes, wines, jellies, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. and &s;uppo&s;ing the&s;e to begin at half pa&s;t five, and &s;upper to be on table at half pa&s;t ten, though the intermediate hours are fully employ|ed in eating and drinking, it does not in the lea&s;t prevent the &s;upper being devoured, as King Richard voraciou&s;ly &s;ays, "marrow, bones and all", for though in general life, at <HI>home,</HI> the Dutch eat but little of &s;olid food, they pay it off <HI>abroad</HI> with mo&s;t incontinent rapacity. In|deed, they &s;eem, like certain wild bea&s;ts in training for the grand gorging day, when they are to be turned out upon criminals, to re&s;erve them&s;elves for the&s;e great public occa&s;ions: and a Dutch &s;upper, at the end of five hours &s;tuf|fing, might very well furni&s;h out one of our Lord Mayor's fea&s;ts, and &s;atisfy all the man|&s;ion-hou&s;e mon&s;ters on any one of the impor|tant days,

<P><PB N="227" REF="238">There are di&s;per&s;ed over the provinces of Holland, of Pru&s;&s;ia, and of Germany, various towns, bourgs, and villages, which among&s;t other privileges po&s;&s;e&s;s that of affording pro|tection to fugitives for debt: and there are &s;ome which offer an a&s;vlum even for crimes. Of the&s;e Vianne, Cleves, and Neuweid, may be mentioned among&s;t others. They are either free towns, or independent &s;e gneuries. The former have u&s;ually taken their ri&s;e from the exigence of the &s;tate, which has often made the Prince a borrower of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e people. The Emperors frequently wanting &s;upplies of money to carry on their wars, or for other occa&s;ions, have hir'd large &s;ums of great trading towns, and paid the debt in certain extra grants, privileges, and immunities, making them independent of the governors of the provinces or di&s;tricts where tho&s;e towns &s;tood, or in their neighbourhood. Accordingly &s;uch places remain free; exerci&s;ing all kinds of &s;overeign power, with the right of enacting laws, con|&s;tituting authorities, courts of ju&s;tice, and coining, as well as of offering a &s;anctuary to &s;trangers, debtors, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;I am &s;orry to in|forth you, that this latter privilege is not &s;eldom made a revenue of the town, or the &s;eigneur, or a perqui&s;ite of office. But it mu&s;t
<PB N="228" REF="239">be owned the fee is not large,&mdash;a guinea or two for in&s;tance per per&s;on, which makes your per&s;on &s;acred beyond limitation, provided neverthele&s;s you conform peaceably to the laws of the land where you e&s;tabli&s;h your re&s;idence, which it is certainly not only decent but ea&s;y to do, as they are no way rigorous in them|&s;elves, and the protected places are for the mo&s;t part &s;ituated in a fine country.</P>
<P>Vianne, for in&s;tance, is built on the banks of a fine river, on the confine of the beautiful province of Utrecht, nearly half way betwixt Rotterdam and Nimeguen. It remains po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of all rights of Seignieur&s;hip independent of Holland. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Fanum Dianae, of which Ptolemy makes mention.</P>
<P>The towns and villages of the Dutchy of Cleves already live in my de&s;cription, and I tru&s;t in the reader's memory. And &s;hould mis|fortune find it nece&s;&s;ary to take refuge in either of the&s;e he will pa&s;s his days or years of exile amid&s;t the beauty and health of nature.</P>

<PB N="229" REF="240">it has claims on our attention, being one of the mo&s;t agreeable towns and placed in one of the mo&s;t charming countries of Europe. The ac|count of it is &s;ufficiently popular, but the be&s;t Gleaning of it is by the author of the journey, or rather voyage of the Rhine, a work I have already commended.</P>
<P>"It is in this town, &s;ays he, that the writer of the&s;e pages&mdash;a victim of French de&s;poti&s;m, has found refuge, honour, and happine&s;s; after having been de&s;poiled of 1,400,000 livres, and driven from a country that was dear to him. It is in this free and &s;acred land he at length is permitted to re&s;ide in peace with his re&s;cued family. And here, al&s;o, it is, that he announces a virtuous Prince, and a gentle race, to philo|&s;ophers, men of letters and of humanity&mdash;to peaceable citizens, and to ingenious arti&s;ts&mdash;to hone&s;t labourers, and to the worthy of all de&s;criptions, who like him may be expelled from the &s;cenes of rapine and de&s;olation."</P>
<P>The gratitude of this author for the protec|tion he received, has not &s;educed him into effu&s;ions of prai&s;e, which exceed the truth. The &s;weet &s;ejour of Neuweid merits all he has &s;aid of it. It is &s;ituated on the borders of the
<PB N="230" REF="241">Rhine, betwixt Bonne and Coblentz. The country is agreeable, the inhabitants &s;ociable, and the air whole&s;ome. Vines and orchards &s;urround it. Hills and vallies &s;mile on every &s;ide. The water is particularly excellent, the corn good and abundant. Butcher's meat in all its variety, and a no le&s;s plenty of vegetables, fruit, fi&s;h, fowl, and game. Lodgings are rea|&s;onable, and elegant. The prime of every commodity from the famous fairs of Bonne, Coblentz, Mayence, and Franck&s;ort, as well as from Holland, are to be had at Neuwerd, as they can come by water to your very door. And to crown the whole the reigning prince is a man of politene&s;s, urbanity, genius, peace, and benevolence. He is de&s;cended from one of the mo&s;t honourable and ancient hou&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and what is better, he is in every &s;en&s;e of the term an HONEST MAN! Of the prince, of his family, and of his palace of Mount-Repo&s;e, (two leagues from Neuweid) a thou&s;and fine things have been &s;aid by the ingenious writer above|mentioned, but after what I have ju&s;t termed him, would not all the&s;e go to an anti-climax:
<Q>"An hone&s;t man's the noble&s;t work of God."</Q> Among&s;t the objectionable things which an Engli&s;h traveller will find in Pru&s;&s;ia, We&s;t|phalia, <PB N="231" REF="242">and through all the Catholic countries, is the frequency of holy-days, fea&s;ts, fa&s;ts, and fairs.</P>
<P>I would have every creature adore his Crea|tor, according to the cu&s;toms of his country, and re&s;ort to the places of wor&s;hip as often as his piety inclines. But I cannot fail to regret that the church &s;hould exact an ob&s;ervance of mere ceremonies which trench on the duties of &s;ocial life, being convinced that a per|formance of the&s;e is a part of religion. It is the re&s;ult of reiterated ob&s;ervation that enables me to a&s;&s;ure you nearly the half of a &s;ervant's and labourer's time is taken up in the churches, and very frequently made the pretext for a neglect of nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s, and, indeed, promotes idlene&s;s. I have always noted that the mo&s;t church going people in this country are the wor&s;t dome&s;tics, the mo&s;t &s;upine, and the mo&s;t &s;uper&s;titious. How it happens I know not, but religion in this country &s;eldom works the blood into enthu&s;ia&s;m: the being righteous overmuch in Germany more commonly pro|duces a moody torpid &s;tupidity. Methodi&s;ts and other fanatic &s;ectaries are rare. The&s;e bodies among&s;t us produce, you know, ebulli|tions of zeal that ferment to di&s;traction. It is
<PB N="232" REF="243">in England a raging madne&s;s; in the German dominions a gloomy melancholy; and with re&s;pect to &s;ociety, the latter is a the evil mo&s;t to be lamented. The fir&s;t is a violent fit, and pa&s;&s;es &s;oon away, and though the returns of the paroxi&s;m are quick, the intervals admit of &s;ome activity in &s;ecular affairs. But the Ger|man malady after &s;ending a man from his hone&s;t employments, his ma&s;ter and his family, two or three days in the week without counting Sunday, continues him in a kind of religious apathy all the re&s;t of the year. On the holy|days it is with great difficulty a cook will dre&s;s dinner, or a chambermaid to&s;s up the beds. If you want bread it mu&s;t be made and baked the day before: to put an hand in the oven would be &s;acrilege, and to fetch a pail of water an offence laid up among&s;t others for next confe&s;&s;ion. The con&s;equence of all this is, that after they have run in and out of the church till they are weary, you will &s;ee them in lazy circles &s;tand about the &s;treets with folded arms and gapeing mouths, or &s;leeping in their hou&s;es, kitchens, &amp;c. At intervals, however, they wake to the recollection of the Saint in who&s;e honour the fete is in&s;tituted, and renew their a&s;pirations. It is common to hear them break forth in the mid&s;t of any or|dinary <PB N="233" REF="244">occupation, even during the few days their religion &s;uffers them to work, into an hymn or &s;piritual &s;ong. I once pa&s;t &s;ome months in an hou&s;e where a pea&s;ant &s;ervant to his other bu&s;ine&s;&s;es, added that of a barber; and under who&s;e razor, (being in a &s;mall country place), I came almo&s;t every day. He had been u&s;ed on my fir&s;t employing him only to reap the chins of the ru&s;tics, and any thing that could cut &s;tubble would an&s;wer that purpo&s;e; for, be&s;ides that it is the general practice for the gentry of Germany of &s;have only once a-week, a German chin after it <HI>has</HI> been &s;haved would turn the edge of a Dutch razor. When the man, therefore, came upon a face that called for daily &s;craping, and found it had been u&s;ed to gentle u&s;age, he looked upon it as &s;o arduous an undertaking, that he called in all the might of his religion to &s;trengthen his arm, and incontinently retired into a little chapel adjoining the hou&s;e, both before and after the operation; fir&s;t for going through his job with judgment, and then in thank&s;giving, for having performed it without cutting my throat. On the&s;e occa&s;ions he always &s;ung two &s;taves of the &s;ame p&s;alm, and with &s;o much violence of lungs that one would think he imagined heaven would be deaf to his
<PB N="234" REF="245">prayers. Indeed I often thought &s;o too, for, not with&s;tanding his bawling, if my chin and throat came off with no more than half a dozen fla&s;hes, the blood gu&s;hing at each, I reckoned it a morning of e&s;cape. But this fellow would &s;ometime bur&s;t forth into a mu&s;ical howl at mealtime, with the meat in his mouth; and yet, having a few acres of ground now and then to reap and mow, al&s;o, if too much &s;un, or rain, or from, or &s;now, thinned his crops, be would be as full of growl again&s;t the good God of &s;ea&s;ons, as if the were&mdash;a French Republican!</P>
<P>Fairs, or what they call Kermi&s;&s;es, are very proper &s;upplements to their fa&s;ts and holy|days: not that tho&s;e are more numerous than in England, but becau&s;e it is the cu&s;tom for the &s;ervants to vi&s;it every kermis, at whatever di&s;tance, where &s;he or they have a friend, or relation: and as each kermis la&s;ts a week, and as it is thought very hard if the permi&s;&s;ion is not given for at lea&s;t a couple of days at each, you may gue&s;s in what a &s;ituation families are le&s;t betwixt one practice and another. If by accident you call on a friend, and &s;tay dinner, the cook is gone to the kermis, or to the church, or el&s;e it is a fa&s;t-day, and &s;he can do
<PB N="235" REF="246">nothing, but drink coffee <HI>eight or ten times,</HI> and go to the kirk.</P>
<P>Yet a kermis, particularly a village one, is worth &s;eeing. It is an annual a&s;&s;ociation of all the &s;cattered parts of a man's family and friends. I attended one in We&s;tphalia, on a principle of that general curio&s;ity which carries me every where. But having no village con|nexions while at Cleyes, I wandered about a little place in the neighbourhood during ker|mis time. The fir&s;t joyful groupe which I &s;aw gathered together arre&s;ted my &s;tep. I &s;tood leaning on the gate of a large farm yard, at the farther end of which I ob&s;erved a number of per&s;ons &s;itting round a table, and others danc|ing, and almo&s;t every body &s;inging. The fir&s;t glymp&s;e of a &s;tranger brings an invitation, e&s;pecially on public occa&s;ions. This urbanity is almo&s;t univer&s;al in We&s;tphalia. I followed a courteous introducer who led me to the ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e. Their te&s;ti|monies of welcome came &s;o fa&s;t upon me, that had I eat and drank of half the different good things which were &s;et before me, I mu&s;t have been <HI>killed with kindne&s;s</HI> on the &s;pot. I &s;oon under&s;tood that I was at the hou&s;e of a farmer, who&s;e happy family from great grandfather to
<PB N="236" REF="247">grand-child, were among&s;t the gue&s;ts: and all the&s;e different characters on the &s;tage of human life, were dancing on a gra&s;s plat behind the great barn, and all &s;uch as were or had been married, arrayed in their bridal dre&s;&s;es. One of the brothers' wives introduced a &s;ackling of two months to the great-grand|father, who was enjoying health, in the &s;ight of four and thirty relations, and in the Syth year of his age! It was a <HI>benquet</HI> for a good natured &s;pectator to &s;ee the joy with which the old man danced the little creature on his knee, then pre&s;ented him to the other parts of his family, according to &s;eniority, that the young|ling might have a <HI>kermi&s;s-ki&s;s</HI> from all his kindred. But the pretty mother! How I wi&s;h that you had &s;een the mother during this tran&s;action:&mdash;not on account of her prettine&s;s, but becau&s;e the fine&s;t blu&s;hes that ever circu|lated from the heart into the countenance, and the &s;ofte&s;t tears that maternal fondne&s;s ever brought into the face of a lovely young woman, would then have been enjoyed by my friend! and it was her fir&s;t child! and it had been a match of love; and the babe, according to its parents, wi&s;h was a &s;on, and according to family wi&s;hes al&s;o, it bore the name of its great-grand|&s;ire, and was thought, by affection (who
<PB N="237" REF="248">takes likene&s;&s;es you know in a moment) to inherit the hue of the eyes and &s;ome of the features. The attitude, half bending over it, in its circuit, as it pa&s;&s;ed from the arms of one relation to tho&s;e of another, was a &s;ubject for painting, and might have been highly fini&s;hed; but the extacy in which, at the end of the cere|mony, &s;he received, and the ki&s;&s;es with which &s;he covered it, were beyond the reach of human pencil, and required all the powers of nature who works in colours "dipt in heaven." After this every body drank health, and many more happy <HI>family f&eacute;tes</HI> to the old man; who, in return, pledged a bumper of Rheni&s;h to the company; one of the &s;ons a&s;&s;ured me that the veteran's maladies were &s;light, and always cured by a vi&s;it to one or other of his family. His medical &s;on <HI>pre&s;cribed</HI> this affectionate remedy: thus when his own home became a little &s;olitary, the good old man went to another: and as all the family live within a &s;hort di&s;tance from the ancient man&s;ion of this their fore|father, there is a cure within reach for every di&s;order: he gets rid of a cold at the hou&s;e of one child, of a <HI>fever</HI> at that of another, of a touch of the rhumati&s;m at a third's, and at a fourth's of an head-ach. Upon getting a little more into the private hi&s;tory of the hou&s;e,
<PB N="238" REF="249">(from a gue&s;t who was my next hand neigh|bour, and ju&s;t animated enough with wine to become a benevolent hi&s;torian) I found that the grand children were worthy of the &s;ire; for that all the brothers, of which there were nine, had entered into a &s;ocial dome&s;tic compact, the particular articles of which had been com|mitted to writing; that in the cour&s;e of affairs, they were mutually to &s;erve each other, either with a &s;um of money, or any other a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;uited to the nature and nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e. And as if Providence intended to try the virtue and &s;incerity of each, all the brothers in turn <HI>wanted</HI> and <HI>found</HI> a friend in the good offices of each other.&mdash;Ah, my friend, we have not got all the &s;implicity, happine&s;s, and virtue to our|&s;elves: and God forbid we ever &s;hould have. How ble&s;&s;ed to &s;hare them, as they <HI>are</HI> &s;hared, with all the human race!</P>
<P>I have gleaned various in&s;tances of their being di&s;per&s;ed over the&s;e divi&s;ions of the globe. I have &s;hewn to you the natural affec|tions blooming in Holland, Cambria, and We&s;tphalia. Permit me now to pre&s;ent to you one more example, of which I was an eye witne&s;s in the fir&s;t mentioned country.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="250">In a trip from the Hague to Rotterdam, and from thence to Haarlem, I was ju&s;t in time for the after-dinner boat to get a place in the cabin, and to &s;ee an aged mother and her daughter give and receive the farewel looks, expre&s;&s;ions, and embraces, to and from &s;ome friends and relatives. Never did I &s;ee the feelings of the heart &s;hine with more lucid brightne&s;s while each was in view of the other; nor de&s;cend in more tender tears when they could behold each other no longer. As the boat moved on, the groupe on &s;hore followed as long as they could at the edges of the canal, and the party in the cabin thru&s;t their heads out of the door to catch the kind looks and &s;ayings, till the hor&s;e being hooked to the &s;chuyt, they could no longer keep pace with us. The &s;ucceeding moments were pa&s;&s;ed in deep &s;ighs on the part of the mother, and tears on that of the daughter, neither of whom took any more notice of me, nor of any other per&s;on in the cabin, than of the cu&s;hions they &s;at on. A per&s;on in the corner told me the&s;e people would, perhaps, never &s;ee each other again for &s;ome years, as the mother and daughter were going to &s;ettle in North Holland.</P>
<P>I was prepared to hear him &s;ay North America at lea&s;t: but to people <HI>untravelled,</HI> a
<PB N="240" REF="251">&s;eparation of fifty miles is an immea&s;urable di&s;tance. And the &s;ympathy of divided affec|tion extends the &s;pace to infinity! The &s;ilence was long, and I honoured them for it; had there been a cranny in their hearts for the en|trance of common place curio&s;ity, or for con|ver&s;ation with a &s;tranger, I &s;hould have deemed it a robbery of what was due to their ab&s;ent friends. I perceived the daughter to &s;train her longing eyes towards the only opening at which there might be a <HI>po&s;&s;ibility</HI> of catching a parting glymp&s;e of her relations, and I di&s;covered at the &s;ame time, that I intercepted her &s;ight&mdash; would to heaven that &s;tranger did not &s;it be|twixt me and my friends, was the &s;entiment written in every line of her face: but as &s;he continued to look, I gave her all the chances &s;he could expect by moving my po&s;ition. No &s;ooner had I done &s;o than &s;he exclaimed&mdash;I &s;ee poor Catherine's cloak, and the &s;kirt of Sally's gown, through the window! The glow of that friend&s;hip which is &s;o deliciou&s;ly animating in the days of our youth, flu&s;hed her cheeks; but it was &s;weetly blended al&s;o with the gratitude, which, at that period of our lives, gives &s;uch a colouring and grace to the complexion; after this &s;he farther won my regard by &s;uch a pen|&s;ive ca&s;t of the head, and direction of the eyes,
<PB N="241" REF="252">as plainly indicated her heart was returning to the Hague, with her friends, and &s;he took little or no notice of any thing, or any body el&s;e, during the re&s;t of the voyage.</P>
<P>I have &s;lightly mentioned to you &s;omewhere the love of ornament among&s;t the Dutch, as incon&s;i&s;tent with the weight, not to &s;ay heavi|ne&s;s, of their appearance. I think this over|finery is to be di&s;covered principally in their liveries, which are often gaudy and rich, <HI>&s;ome|times</HI> elegant. It is exhibited al&s;o in their fur|niture, barges, chimneys, china, and mills. It even &s;hews it&s;elf in certain inde&s;cribable places, yet, generally &s;peaking, all the&s;e things are &s;o out of keeping with their own figures and fa&s;hions&mdash;&s;uch, for in&s;tance, as their deep brown or blue &s;uits of Dutch home&s;pun or Pru&s;&s;ian, their unyielding features, immen&s;e breeches, prepo&s;terous petticoats, &s;tupendous hip-pads, and mea&s;ured pace&mdash;that they &s;eem as little of a piece as if the &s;aid home&s;pun jerkins, &amp;c. were to be trimmed with gold and &s;ilver foils and fringes.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>waterfaring men</HI> (fre&s;h or &s;alt) they are <HI>be-buttoned</HI> from top to toe, each button, not excepting tho&s;e of the wai&s;tband, a third
<PB N="242" REF="253">part larger than an Engli&s;h crown-piece, and always of &s;olid &s;ilver. One whim&s;ical fellow, who was ma&s;ter of a fi&s;hing-&s;mack, u&s;ed to ex|hibit him&s;elf with a &s;uit of coar&s;e blue bays, or &s;erge, the coat buttons of which were Zea|land &s;ix-dollars (a piece of &s;ilver the &s;ize of our crown) the wai&s;tcoat was buttoned with florins, the trowzers with &s;chellings (larger than our &s;hilling) the wai&s;tband and flaps with pieces of thirty &s;tivers (half-a-crown), his check &s;hirt with dublikys (&s;ilver two-pences), and his &s;hoes were fa&s;tened by twenty-eight &s;tiver pieces, cut into cla&s;ps, and a gilder for the button of his hat; which hat was, in it&s;elf, a curio&s;ity, being folded into three corners, in the way that grocers make up their penny|worths, into long bags of white-brown paper, which, you know, are,
<Q>"Small by degrees, and <HI>subim&s;ically</HI> le&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>Indeed even the <HI>higher</HI> cla&s;s of Hollanders are too full of button, wearing four where an Engli&s;hman would content him&s;elf with one, and placing them &s;o clo&s;e that it is quite a labour to fa&s;ten and loo&s;e them.</P>
<P>I have prai&s;ed the Dutch neatne&s;s; it is <HI>worthy</HI> of prai&s;e; but occa&s;ionally carried to
<PB N="243" REF="254">exce&s;s. It now and then goes into caricature. You have always the fear of the pail and &s;crub|bing bru&s;hes before your eyes. On the grand cleaning day, which here is Friday, the maid &s;ervants are to be &s;een puddling below, ankle|deep, and &s;pouting above at the windows as if they were playing off an engine to extingui&s;h a conflagration; although the great end pro|po&s;ed, is only to wa&s;h away the du&s;t that may have gathered on the &s;a&s;hes, in the cour&s;e of the week. An Engli&s;h traveller who comes from the comfort of a dry room, or who&s;e &s;tate of health would &s;uffer from damps, mu&s;t reconcile to this <HI>d&eacute;&s;agrement</HI> as well as he can; as he will, from an intention of civility, be &s;hewn into an apartment ju&s;t wa&s;hed, he had better double his defen&s;e, by an additional pair of &s;ocks, or &s;tockings; for the Dutch landlord would deem it rude to take his gue&s;t into a room that has not been laid under water &s;ince the la&s;t company went out of it, and were you to argue again&s;t the thing, he would &s;et you down as a dirty traveller, who did not know how to behave your&s;elf in a clean country.</P>
<P>Through every part of Holland, the natives are great ob&s;ervers of &s;ymmetry. Is a bru&s;h,
<PB N="244" REF="255">for example, part of the furniture of a room, it will be found hanging up, equidi&s;tant with another of the &s;ame &s;ize, &s;hape, and fa&s;hion, to an&s;wer it.
<Q><L>"Cup faces cup, each &s;ancer has its brother,</L>
<L>"And half the cup-board ju&s;t reflects the other."</L></Q> This matter is al&s;o &s;poken to in former Gleanings.</P>
<P>But with re&s;pect to the modes of <HI>dre&s;&s;ing,</HI> it is out of my memory whether I have before mentioned a great and general re&s;emblance betwixt the Welch and German pea&s;antry. At lea&s;t eighty out of every hundred of the latter are habited in the dark blue, or deep brown of the former, and have a number of cu&s;toms in common, which is the le&s;s to be wondered at, when we con&s;ider the mixture of the two nations, when the Saxons, &s;ometimes by treachery, &s;ometimes by invitation, and &s;ome|times by inva&s;ion, became ma&s;ters or partners of Cambria. But &s;o many ages having pa&s;&s;ed away &s;ince the Saxon heptarchy, and even &s;ince the expul&s;ion of the Germans, whether friends or enemies, from the principality of Wales, it was curious enough for a traveller, who had ju&s;t been gleaning that country, to find &s;uch a
<PB N="245" REF="256">general re&s;emblance in the dre&s;s, air, habits, and even features of a people &s;o remote, and with which, modernly &s;peaking, they had not, nor ever could have, the &s;lighte&s;t intercour&s;e.</P>
<P><Q>They who came over out of Germany into Wales (&s;ays Caradoc) to aid the Britons again&s;t their enemies, the Picts and Scots, were partly Saxons, Angles, and Juthes; from the fir&s;t of which came the people of E&s;&s;ex, Su&s;&s;ex, Middle&s;ex, and the We&s;t Saxons; from the Angles, the Ea&s;t Angles and the Mercians, and they that inhabited the North &s;ide of the Humber; from the Juthes, the Kenti&s;h men, and they who &s;ettled in the I&s;le of Wight.</Q></P>
<P>Thus the Engli&s;h nation and its appendages, like the Engli&s;h language, appears to be a compound of every other country, and, par|ticularly, of Germany. From &s;ettlements, marriages, de&s;cents, &amp;c. it is rea&s;onable that there &s;hould be pre&s;erved &s;ome family cu&s;toms and family features. A likene&s;s of counte|nance may be traeed, indeed, through all cla&s;&s;es of the Empires of Germany and Great Britain: and the former being certainly (taken as an whole) a brave, ingenious, and generous
<PB N="246" REF="257">nation, I was plea&s;ed to trace the &s;imilitude, and admit the original alliance. Time has worn out the re&s;entments; but whatever brings to memory a bond of connexion, and of amity, though formed between individuals or countries three thou&s;and years ago, has a charm for the heart. Had I but the hem of a garment in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, that had been worn by the greate&s;t foe of my family on the day of re|conciliation, or at the moment that he came to my ance&s;tor (whom he had injured) to avow, and to repent of, the wrong, and to promi&s;e future loving-kindne&s;s,&mdash;that fragment of the dre&s;s &s;hould have a place in my wardrobe, and be held as a memorial.</P>
<P>With regard to the ancient Germans, were we to take a comparative view of them, and of the ancient Britons, we &s;hould find a &s;imi|litude in the features of their minds as well as manners, e&s;pecially in the grand articles of war and religion. The heroes, &s;ages, and prie&s;ts of one country, had their counter|parts in the other; had Cambria her Druids, Bards, and Chiefs, that devoted them&s;elves to wounds and death, for the &s;ake of God and their country, conformably to the &s;acrifice, the chivalry, and wor&s;hip of the times, the Ger|manic <PB N="247" REF="258">nations had holy, brave, and wi&s;e men who corre&s;ponded to the&s;e characters, and afford additional evidence of their having bor|rowed manners, maxims, and &s;uper&s;titions, from one another.</P>
<P>In order to throw lu&s;tre on the parallel, I will pick a little hi&s;torical Gleaning of what I remember. We venerate the traditionary independence which animated the ancient Welch. The ancient Germans cultured the &s;ame &s;pirit. The Roman hi&s;torian reports them to re&s;pect only tho&s;e duties, which they impo&s;ed on them&s;elves. The noble&s;t youths blu&s;hed not to be numbered among the faithful companions of &s;ome renowned chiefs, to whom they devoted their arms and &s;ervice. A noble emulation prevailed among&s;t the companions to obtain the fir&s;t place in the e&s;teem of their chief; among&s;t the chiefs to acquire the greate&s;t number of valiant companions. The glory of &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed heroes diffu&s;ed it&s;elf beyond the narrow limits of their own tribe. In the hour of danger it was &s;hameful for the chief to be &s;urpa&s;&s;ed in valour by his companions; &s;hameful for the companions not to equal the valour of their chief. To &s;urvive his fall in battle was indelible infamy. To protect his
<PB N="248" REF="259">per&s;on, and to adorn his glory with the trophies of their own exploits, were the mo&s;t &s;acred of their duties. The chiefs combated for the victory, the companions for the chief. The noble&s;t warriours, whenever their native country was &s;unk in the lazine&s;s of peace, maintained their numerous bands in &s;ome di&s;tant &s;cene of action, to exerci&s;e their re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit, and to acquire renown by voluntary dangers. Gifts, worthy of &s;oldiers, the war|like &s;teed, the bloody and ever victorious lance, were the rewards which the companions claimed from the liberality of their chief. The rude plenty of his ho&s;pitable board was the only pay that <HI>he</HI> could be&s;tow, or <HI>they</HI> would accept. War, and the free-will offerings of his friends &s;upplied this munificence.</P>
<P>But, to u&s;e the language of Bi&s;hop Hurd on another occa&s;ion, and apply them to this, le&s;t you &s;hould think my love of antiquity has operated like enchantment, in regard to the ancient German chiefs and companions, I mu&s;t de&s;ire you to con&s;ider the courage and conduct of the modern ones, who have &s;o long, and &s;o nobly, and almo&s;t without a day's rece&s;s, re|pelled the hordes of France, when almo&s;t <HI>her whole population has been forced into the field.</HI>
<PB N="249" REF="260">Can we di&s;cover, in times pa&s;t, a braver, a more faithful, or a more per&s;evering body of men, than tho&s;e &s;ubjects of Au&s;tria, who are, at this very moment, under command of Beau|lieu, Clairfait, and Cobourg? Each of whom might certainly hold a place in the temple of Victory as di&s;tingui&s;hed as any general that Rome had to boa&s;t. Nor could the bolde&s;t of the race of Cadwallader be di&s;honoured by an alliance with the &s;ublime progenitors of the&s;e illu&s;trious de&s;cendents.</P>
<P>It is painful to ob&s;erve that the religious zeal of the old Germans was as wild, &s;avage, and <HI>fatal,</HI> as that of the ancient Britons, and that the fanatic mini&s;ters of the one an&s;wered to the Druids of the other. Both were alike able to per&s;uade, that, "by &s;ome ridiculous arts of divination, they could di&s;cover the will of the &s;uperior beings; and both taught that human &s;acrifices were the mo&s;t precious and acceptable offerings to their altars. The Ger|manic, like the Druidical temples, were in dark and ancient groves, con&s;ecrated by the reverence of &s;ucceeding generations. <Q>Their &s;ecret gloom, the imagined re&s;idence of an invi&s;ible power (&s;ays Gibbon) by pre&s;enting no di&s;tinct object of fear, or wor&s;hip, im|pre&s;&s;ed <PB N="250" REF="261">the mind with a &s;till deeper &s;en&s;e of religious horror.</Q> I am &s;orry to di&s;cover a yet &s;tricter &s;imilitude between the Prie&s;ts of Ger|many, and the Druids of Wales: the former no le&s;s than the latter, we are informed, had been taught by experience the u&s;e of every artifice that could pre&s;erve and fortify impre&s;|&s;ions &s;o well &s;uited to their own intere&s;t; and it has been finely remarked, that the &s;ame igno|rance which renders barbarians incapable of conceiving, and of embracing, the u&s;eful re&s;traints of law, expo&s;es then aked and unarm'd to the blind terrors of &s;uper&s;tition. The Ger|man prie&s;ts, improving this favourable temper of their countrymen, even in temporal con|cerns, which the magi&s;trate could not venture to exerci&s;e; and the defects of civil policy, were, &s;ometimes, &s;upplied by the interpo&s;ition of eccle&s;ia&s;tical authority.</P>
<P>We find, too, that ancient Germany, like ancient Briton, had her bards, who&s;e genius, character, and office, were extremely alike in one country and in the other. It is not ea&s;ily to be conceived, &s;ays one of Rome's be&s;t hi&s;to|rians, how this &s;ingular order of men, (&s;peak|ing of the German bards) contrived to kindle the enthu&s;ia&s;m of arms and glory in the brea&s;ts
<PB N="251" REF="262">of their audience. It was in the hour of battle, or in the fea&s;t of victory, that they celebrated the glory of heroes of ancient days, the ance&s;tors of tho&s;e warlike chieftains who li&s;tened with tran&s;port to the animated &s;trains. The view of arms, of victory, and of danger, heightened the effect of the military &s;ong, and the pa&s;&s;ions which it tended to excite, the de|&s;ire of fame, and the contempt of death, were the habitual &s;entiments of a German mind.</P>
<P>We may ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e, that with the help of a glowing imagination, which was not wanting, the audience imputed to the bards of Germany all the power which poe&s;y her&s;elf has, in &s;ome of her noble&s;t flights, attributed to the bards of Wales.&mdash;

<P>Jo&s;eph the &s;econd, who was an oeconomi&s;t, left to (Leopold who did not live long enough, after he became Emperor, to di&s;&s;ipate them) an unincumber'd diadem and immen&s;e trea&s;ures. The&s;e all concenter'd in the pre&s;ent Emperor, to whom was bequeathed the di&s;po&s;al of them &s;o unconditionally, that the dowager empre&s;s his mother was, in a manner, rather a dependent on his bounty, than po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of powers in her&s;elf to claim as widow, wife, and mother. No &s;ooner did the youth find him&s;elf thus danger|ou&s;ly placed, than he re&s;olved to put it out of his <HI>own</HI> power to act unbecoming the &s;on of an Empre&s;s and Queen.

The long tried virtues of that noble lady, the tender confidence and dome&s;tic love, in which &s;he lived with my father, con|vinces me, that it never could have been in|tended, that &s;o good a wife, &s;o kind a parent, and &s;o excellent a woman, could be left in a &s;tate of dependence on her &s;on. Much more likely is it that the &s;on &s;hould have been be|queathed to the commands, indulgence, and management of his mother. Or if it <HI>was</HI> in|tended that the &s;on &s;hould <HI>receive</HI> the whole revenues of the empire, it could only be in confidence that he would act as her agent, and &s;ee that her private, her natural, and proper rights were paid into her coffers with the lea&s;t care and inconvenience to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>"In the latter ca&s;e, I hope I &s;hould be found, throughout my reign, a faithful &s;teward of my dear parent and of the people; and, &s;uppo&s;ing, for a moment, this ca&s;e a po&s;&s;ible one, I cannot be in&s;en&s;ible to the exalted affection and e&s;teem the late Emperor and King mu&s;t have for me,

But human nature is &s;o frail, and the tru&s;t is &s;o aweful, that I tremble while I po&s;&s;e&s;s it; and cannot, indeed, be ea&s;y, till I have di&s;burthened my&s;elf of the weight it impo&s;es. To this end, my loving friends, mini&s;ters and &s;ubjects, I have herein bound my&s;elf, (&s;hewing the &s;croll) by an in&s;trument of the la&s;t &s;olemnity, to be|come re&s;pon&s;ible in a yearly &s;um &s;uited to her rank although inferior to her de&s;ervings. And I have, as nearly as may be, made this di&s;po|&s;ition from my private funds, and from &s;ources the lea&s;t likely to infringe on, or to affect, the trea&s;ures of the &s;tate, which I hold in tru&s;t <HI>al&s;o,</HI>&mdash;for the honour of my empire, and the pro&s;perity of Au&s;tria; yet I con&s;ider my&s;elf as called upon by my &s;ubjects to explain, account for, and ju&s;tify every expenditure, before I make an arrangement in favor of any part of my own family: But I feel at the &s;ame time, that it is an act of duty and ju&s;tice on my part, which will be crowned by the &s;anction of all any people.</P>

<P>As to my poor nightingales and &s;tockdove, though they had more cau&s;e than ever to lament that terror, which, in conventional language, is <HI>the order of the day,</HI> had &s;ent them to mourn prematurely in other lands:
<Q><L>"&mdash; The very &s;pot,</L>
<L>"Where many a time they carol'd, was forgot."</L></Q> for the little thicket, which had been their leafy &s;anctuary was burnt up by the&s;e glorious <HI>free</HI>-booters&mdash;becau&s;e, for&s;ooth, the proprietor was wicked enough to attempt &s;aving him&s;elf
<PB N="271" REF="282">and family by flight, when he heard that a party of <HI>patriots</HI> were likely to invade his village, and the guilty wretch was another <HI>traitor,</HI> who had unfortunately di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf, on a former occa&s;ion, as a lover of his country. Nothing, in &s;hort, remained of the various in|nocent and intere&s;ting objects my heart had ap|preciated, but a fragment of the brook, part of which had been de&s;troyed in the fury of ex|tirpating the thicket; and from the broken gaps the water had worked its way into an op|po&s;ite current to the left, where, in forming a junction of &s;ounds, it &s;eemed to lament the general ruin. But, God knows, the &s;urrounding calamities required no aids from fancy. On the contrary, in this poor &s;uffering little town, and its environs, there <HI>actually</HI> happened &s;uch horrors as Fancy, when <HI>mo&s;t</HI> di&s;po&s;ed to excite terror, her &s;tronge&s;t attribute, never formed. Dreadful <HI>beyond</HI> imagination was a fact which the&s;e inhuman republicans perpetrated on the &s;ucking infant of the haple&s;s fugitive la&s;t men|tioned. He had information that the enemy would be at Kreutznach in a few hours, and being told that he would certainly be among&s;t the <HI>pro&s;cribed,</HI> on account of the active part he had taken, when a party of pea&s;ants bravely defended their all again&s;t a former horde, he
<PB N="272" REF="283">followed the impul&s;e of a panic-&s;truck mo|ment, and filled his two carts, the one with his family, the other with his moveable effects, in order to &s;end them away to a brother farmer's, where they could find a promi&s;ed protection. He followed his little hou&s;ehold with an aching, yet comforted heart, but hearing the &s;ound of the enemy's guns in the road they were to take, and &s;uppo&s;ing the route had been changed, he returned to his cottage, and had hope that the plunderers would pur&s;ue another plan. Alas, this was a flattering ex|pectation. The patriots had heard that a de|tachment of Pru&s;&s;ians were &s;till in Kreutznach, but learning &s;oon after, from a &s;cout, that they had marched out of the village the pre|ceding evening, the patriots &s;ilently made their way into the heart of the town before it was &s;u&s;pected they were in the neighbourhood; for it was late in the night, or rather early in the morning, and the peaceful, harmle&s;s inhabi|tants were in their beds. You will better judge of the confu&s;ion than I can de&s;cribe it. The pea&s;ant &s;acrificed the dead to &s;ave the living, and taking his wife in one hand, and his children, linked arm in arm, in the other, the &s;uckling lying on its mother's brea&s;t, he left his dwelling with a hope of &s;till gaining the
<PB N="273" REF="284">a&s;ylum. A patriot <HI>countryman</HI> and neighbour, however, with whom he had often di&s;puted on the &s;ubject of his principles, noticed his de|parture, and conducted the &s;anguine enemy int the path he had taken. They lingered about till the dawn, which, alas, broke too &s;oon for the fugitives; who, on hearing the voice of their menacing pur&s;uers, had plunged into a wood to the left; but the crying of their own child betrayed them. The barbarians ru&s;hed into the wood, where, &s;preading them&s;elves, they overtook the female part of the wanderers; whom the poor pea&s;ant had quitted for the moment, to explore a track that he conceived might lead them to a &s;mall hamlet on the left; and which, con&s;i&s;ting only of a few &s;cattered huts that &s;tood on the &s;kirts of the fore&s;t, might &s;till pre&s;erve his family. Meantime, they were &s;eated, as he thought, in &s;o &s;ecure a rece&s;s, that the "dogs of war," though in full cry, could not harm them during his ab&s;ence. He was mi&s;taken. The blood-hounds di&s;co|vered their haunt, and, &s;eizing the trembling mother, they tore the babe from her brea&s;t and &s;triking off its head, threw the bloody gift into her lap, as a <HI>pre&s;ent to her husband,</HI> dread|fully &s;wearing, at the &s;ame time, that if &s;he did not per&s;uade him to return, and &s;olicit
<PB N="274" REF="285">pardon for his pa&s;t offen&s;es again&s;t the <HI>French Re|public,</HI> that her own head, and that of every other child, &s;hould an&s;wer it! They left her for other mi&s;chief. Cruel as it is, my friend, you are impatient for the &s;equel of this bloody adventure, which I received, nearly as I relate it, from the mouth of the de&s;olate wife.</P>
<P>On the return of her hu&s;band, gue&s;s, if you can, his &s;en&s;ations&mdash;the bleeding head of his younge&s;t infant, the lifele&s;s trunk of its little body, the agonized mother, the no le&s;s &s;hock|ing pro&s;pect of the remainder of them, all before him! Let your beating heart have re&s;t, however, as to the remainder of this poor family. After the Carmagnols had pa&s;t &s;ome hours in the ravage of Kreutznach, and, in rai&s;ing &s;uch exactions as left famine to fini&s;h what the &s;word had begun, the approach of the Pru&s;&s;ians compelled the enemy to evacuate the town, and the pea&s;ants returned&mdash;they re|turned indeed to an heap of ruins: where

<P>And, in fine, when I left one de&s;olated place, in the hope of gaining more repo&s;e, and &s;ee|ing le&s;s &s;orrow in another, it was, generally &s;peaking, but going from bad to wor&s;e!

<P>"But war has means of de&s;truction more for|midable than the cannon and the &s;word.

<P>All this is unque&s;tionably true of war in general, and no le&s;s certainly founded in fact is the exception which has been made; that as there are di&s;ea&s;es in animal nature which nothing but amputation can remove, &s;o there is, by the depravation of human pa&s;&s;ions, &s;ome|times a gangrene in human &s;ocieties for which fire and &s;word are the nece&s;&s;ary remedies.

To be the favourite lady of a Court and of a Queen, of who&s;e favor &s;o many cour|tiers were jealous; to be pre-eminent for beau|ty, grace and talents, are in them&s;elves frequent objects of malice and ill-report, and not le&s;s productive of hatred and envy, than of love and admiration; nor le&s;s dangerous to the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or, than to be the favourite mini&s;ter of a king,&mdash;a title to who&s;e kindne&s;s, though made
<PB N="304" REF="315">out by high and meritorious qualities, with re|&s;pect to the &s;overeign who di&s;tingui&s;hes and rewards them, mu&s;t always become the &s;ubject of &s;ecret malignancy, or open detraction, with re&s;pect to that part of the public, who&s;e vanity &s;ugge&s;ts to them, at lea&s;t an equal &s;hare of the &s;ame qualities, and who therefore make pre|ten&s;ions to at lea&s;t equal recompen&s;e; and being di&s;appointed, become &s;landerers of cour&s;e; and &s;landerers not only of the &s;aid favourites, but of the &s;aid kings and queens: for it is a rule in defamation not only to abu&s;e tho&s;e who&s;e merit is better rewarded, than the de|famer's, but to involve the per&s;ons reward|ing it in the like cen&s;ure. And I have often wondered that you, my friend, who have &s;o many attractions, and &s;o many friends ready to ac|knowledge it, &s;hould have had &s;o few enemies, covert or avowed, to di&s;pute your claims. I mu&s;t confe&s;s I am among&s;t the number of tho&s;e who regard per&s;ons whom "<HI>every body is &s;aid to &s;peak well of,</HI>" as &s;u&s;picious characters; and I have, on nearer approaches, generally found them over-rated, e&s;pecially for the vir|tues mo&s;t lavi&s;hly <HI>beprai&s;ed:</HI> And by the &s;ame principle I always believe, and have as fre|quently found tho&s;e people, who have a con|trary report from this very officious Mr.
<PB N="305" REF="316">Everybody, who paints his angels and mon|&s;ters larger than the life have few vices but what have been given to them, and that the particular vice mo&s;t in&s;i&s;ted on, is the very one from which the party accu&s;ed is mo&s;t ex|empt. Perhaps the truth of a character is between that partial one given by a friend, that inveterate one imputed by a foe, and that in|&s;ipid neutral one furni&s;hed by an indifferent per&s;on, that has no intere&s;t to abu&s;e, nor any pa&s;&s;ion or affection to prai&s;e you. It floats on my memory that I am repeating an ob&s;ervation &s;ent you in a former Letter; if &s;o, accept this renewal of the remark, as an evidence of its being a trui&s;m. But then where, you will &s;ay, &s;hall we look for, where find &s;uch a di&s;pa&s;&s;ion|ate reporter, neither influenced by fondne&s;s, enmity nor languor? And if we could find him, would his portraits be agreeable?&mdash;even if they were &s;trong likene&s;&s;es, they would be without the e&s;&s;entials to render them touching. We had better I believe yield up the pencil, and our&s;elves, to friends and enemies,&mdash;if the latter give the &s;hades too dark, the former can throw in lights to relieve them,&mdash;and if the deadly colouring of the one is too violent and too &s;ombrous, the lovely tinting of the other, and even the flattering touches, which fondne&s;s
<PB N="306" REF="317">works into the features, will &s;often away what|ever appears too har&s;h and too heavy.</P>
<P>Applying this too the unhappy lady, who drew forth the remark, I am per&s;uaded &s;he de&s;erves what has been &s;aid of her virtues, by her friends, as much as &s;he <HI>could</HI> do what has been a&s;&s;erted of her by her enemies; while both mu&s;t &s;urely join in lamenting her fate; the particulars of which, blended with &s;ome account of her character, are as follow.</P>
<P>Her maiden name was Maria Tere&s;a Loui&s;a of Savoy Carignan; &s;he married Louis Alex|ander Jo&s;eph Stani&s;laus, of Bourbon, Prince of Lamballe, Pre&s;ident of the Council, and a Prince of the Blood. The Prince&s;s, who had formed her attachment to the Queen of France in the day of royal pro&s;perity, re&s;olved not to for&s;ake her in the day of di&s;tre&s;s. A &s;eries of invitations from &s;ome of the fir&s;t families in England, who laid a regular &s;iege for her com|pany, yet at la&s;t obtained it almo&s;t by &s;torm, took her from her friend for a &s;hort time. Her reception in London, in the be&s;t circles, and at court, re&agrave;ched her affections, and won her gratitude, and pointed out a &s;afe protection from the tempe&s;t that began to roll over the
<PB N="307" REF="318">hou&s;e of Bourbon: but none of the&s;e had power to hold her from taking her &s;hare of peril and di&s;tre&s;s at Paris; to which city &s;he returned, where a &s;light &s;ummer friend&s;hip would have trembled to approach. She found the unhappy Antoinette, as &s;he expected to find her, &s;ur|rounded by many in&s;ults, many dangers, and hourly in expectation of more. And that &s;uch previous knowledge of her augu&s;t friend's &s;itu|ation was the &s;uperior magnet that drew her from the admiration of St. James's, cannot be doubted; &s;ince to be partaker of &s;uch dangers and in&s;ults, &s;he quitted &s;uch ad|miration. In a word, &s;he returned to Paris, while every body el&s;e of character, or of no character, were flying from it by &s;tratagem, and by every means po&s;&s;ible. The friend&s;hip of courts has been a fruitful, and a favourite theme of poets, who echo the a&s;per&s;ions of ignorance from one to another. Let that of the Prince&s;s de Lamballe for the Queen of France &s;tand on record as a proof that &s;uch cen&s;ures, even if they were admitted to be generally true, have their happy and honourable exceptions. And &s;urely no vicious feeling could have, at &s;uch a moment, drawn the one Prince&s;s to the other; &s;ince there is in guilt that &s;ort of da&s;tardy which induces us to leave and e&s;cape from its
<PB N="308" REF="319">accomplice in the &s;earching hour of calamity, rather than ha&s;ten to receive our &s;hare; and, were any wanting, I &s;hould add this circum|&s;tance as a weighty one, in evidence of the purity of the principles which united Madame de Lamballe to the Queen.</P>
<P>But even in her pri&s;on-hou&s;e &s;he not only performed the gentle offices of a friend to the Queen;&mdash;the general duties of a friend to the indigent were not forgotten. Poverty and &s;orrow were never &s;ent empty or weeping from this amiable Prince&s;s: and her benevolence was, even more than her beauty, the &s;ubject of admiration: the people of Paris, in a more e&s;pecial manner, were the objects of it; and it was by the hands of that very people, in that very city, this illu&s;trious vi&s;itor was to die; in a manner that would have been thought by ju&s;tice it&s;elf, too cruel, too &s;hocking, for the vile&s;t criminal that ever di&s;graced human life, or the laws that protect it.</P>
<P>On the third of that September (1792) which will ever be enrolled in the hi&s;tory of the world, among&s;t the days that have mo&s;t di&s;graced and &s;tained it, this unfortunate and exalted woman, who had long been impri&s;oned in the Hotel de
<PB N="309" REF="320">la Force, was di&s;turbed by the ruffians of the Republic while &s;he was yet on her bed of &s;traw, to leave that dreadful place for another. On her telling them &s;he had no fault to find with her pre&s;ent place of confinement, they rudely an&s;wered &s;he mu&s;t be transferred to the pri&s;on of the Abbey, and that &s;he mu&s;t go without delay; adding that her life depended on her obedience. She then begged of the leader of the&s;e ruffians, who was one of the national guard, to &s;tep a&s;ide with his myrmidons, while &s;he dre&s;&s;ed, and that &s;he would attend him. In a few minutes &s;he recalled the officer, who conducted her through the dungeon to the light, the lea&s;t rays of which that dreadful place excluded. They reached the pri&s;on|doors, the other &s;ide of which they had &s;carce gained, when the unhappy Prince&s;s found rea&s;on for preferring the darkne&s;s of her &s;ub|terraneous cell to long-lo&s;t day light, which pre&s;ented her with nothing but an
<Q><L>"A&s;&s;embly</L>
<L>"All made up of villains,"</L></Q> who&s;e faces, hands, and garments were embrued in blood. The murderers were pur&s;uing their de&s;olations under her eyes. In &s;hort, it was in the middle of that tremendous day on which<PB N="310" REF="321">a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination was the mo&s;t rapacious. Some of the fierce&s;t of the&s;e executioners pau&s;ed from blood to interrogate her, to abu&s;e and menace. <Q>Alas (replied the Prince&s;s) I have nothing to &s;ay: whether I die a few days &s;ooner or later, Sirs, is a matter of indifference to me, &s;ince I perceive that I am devoted; and I am prepared for death.</Q> She was then hur|ried to the tribunal, where the pre&s;ident, being told &s;he refu&s;ed to an&s;wer que&s;tions, exclaimed, "A way with her to the Abbey." This was a &s;ignal for all that was to follow, and her exe|cutioners did not &s;uffer it to e&s;cape. Scarce had &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t &s;treet ere they &s;truck their augu&s;t victim &s;everal times on the back part of the head, with a &s;abre, which was covered with blood&mdash;the blood of &s;o many kings and heroes. Two wretches then took her arms, and obliged her to walk over the dead bodies. She fainted at almo&s;t every &s;tep. In this &s;ituation they &s;tripped her, in&s;ulted her, forced her to &s;toop down, embrace, and ki&s;s the carca&s;&s;es of the murdered citizens. Shock|ing to &s;ay, they then mangled her beautiful bo&s;om, and, refu&s;ing to &s;hew her the indul|gence of a &s;peedy relea&s;e, &s;tabbed her fir&s;t in every part they knew not to be vital. Unable to bear up any longer, &s;he &s;unk on the earth,
<PB N="311" REF="322">when the wanton villainy of the rabble pro|ceeded to the wor&s;t and ba&s;e&s;t extremities. After which, being a&s;ked whether &s;he would yet &s;ave her&s;elf by cur&s;ing the French Queen and family, &s;he &s;truggled even with death to exclaim with energy, <Q>No, never!&mdash;ble&s;s them now and ever!</Q> After which, turning to her per&s;ecutors, &s;he &s;aid, "Behold I am ready" Then, dropping on her knees, &s;he cried, <Q>O God all pui&s;&s;ant pre&s;erve my friends, and receive my &s;oul.</Q> It was in this pious mo|ment the butchers cut off her head, from which hung tho&s;e mo&s;t beautiful tre&s;&s;es, to receive the blood. It was then &s;tuck upon a pike, and carried by one of the wretches, while another followed with her lovely hands, and generous heart, a third bearing her bowels folded round his brutal arms, in a wreath of triumph, while a fourth fa&s;tened her other members to a hurdle, and drew them after him. It was in this manner they paraded the &s;treets of Paris, pau&s;ing at every place, which contained tho&s;e who were known mo&s;t to love and honour this unhappy Prince&s;s. They fir&s;t &s;topped under the windows of the Duke of Penthievre, whom they compelled to &s;urvey the mutilated limbs of his daughter-in-law; and then proceeding to the temple, they forced the royal pri&s;oners
<PB N="312" REF="323">to gaze upon their friend and favourite, de|filed with blood, and di&s;honoured in the du&s;t, and when the Queen fainted at the fight, the heartle&s;s mon&s;ters mocked at her angui&s;h, and aggravated it by every in&s;ult, which the &s;acred reliques of her friend could receive. As the horrible proce&s;&s;ion returned, they obliged the pa&s;&s;engers, whether on foot or in carriages, to ki&s;s the head of the Prince&s;s, and one of the abandoned creatures, with a loud voice ex|claimed, that he had fea&s;ted like an emperor, having dined on the heart of a beautiful Prince&s;s.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e terrors were alas in the infancy of their crimes, or, to u&s;e the language of patrioti&s;m, in the dawn of that <HI>indivi&s;ible and immaculate</HI> Republic, which has &s;ince reached the &s;ummit of its virtues, in the extirpation of the King, Queen, Prince&s;&s;es, and nobles of the land.</P>
<P>In the melancholy annals of the world, there certainly have been periods of time &s;ufficiently on the memory to leave an afflicting impre&s;|&s;ion. That of the Goths and Vandals, when they came to take vengeance on the Roman empire, or roving from their fore&s;t homes,
<PB N="313" REF="324">when they &s;allied, like trooping wolves, in que&s;t of plunder, or of new &s;ettlements, was a dreadful aera. The cruelty of Maximin, when by a &s;ingle act of authority, the whole ma&s;s of wealth, we are told, was at once confi&s;|cated for the u&s;e of the Imperial trea&s;ury, and the &s;oldiers, hardened as they were in acts of violence, blu&s;hed as the &s;acrilegious plunder was di&s;tributed among&s;t them&mdash;this was ano|ther cri&s;is, when, according to the hi&s;torians, a general cry of indignation was heard, im|ploring vengeance on the common enemy of humankind. Ancient tradition but too well authenticated, multiplies the examples by hun|dreds, and were we to carry the &s;urvey to mo|dern times, they would extend to thou&s;ands: among&s;t the latter mu&s;t ever be enumerated the di&s;affection and di&s;memberment of the bloom|ing States of America!

We talk loudly of A&s;iatic &s;lavery, of the hard fate of the fable race, and pitying Europe, no le&s;s than the Gleaner, &s;eems to take the alarm on <HI>then</HI> affecting &s;ubject; but again&s;t the property, liberty and lives of the&s;e poor people, (who cer|tainly <HI>have</HI> undeniable and everla&s;ting rights to their own coun|try, and the fruits of their own indu&s;try and inheritance, while they tre&s;pa&s;s not on the inheritance and indu&s;try of other nations,) again&s;t the&s;e often, and &s;till mark'd victims of <HI>de&s;po|ti&s;m</HI> there is form'd a cruel combination, headed by two of the mo&s;t powerful <HI>de&s;pots,</HI> both of whom by the bye are among&s;t the loude&s;t declaimers again&s;t the <HI>French</HI> Revolution, and by way of &s;upporting this <HI>illu&s;trious incon&s;i&s;tency,</HI> one of the&s;e powers has one grand army in Brabant to a&s;&s;i&s;t in de&s;troying <HI>tyrants,</HI> and another grand army el&s;ewhere to exterminate a free and generous people! And his IMPERIOUS colleague in this cele|brated <HI>bucchanneering,</HI> orders, and joins in, public prayers, fa&s;ts and fe&s;tivals to beg of the God of equity to turn the hearts of the French; and then, at the tag end of this mockery, hitches in, endways, another prayer for the &s;ucce&s;s of her arms again&s;t the&s;e Unfortunates. The fir&s;t prayer is hypocritical, and the la&s;t is &s;incere; but the &s;incerity has, if po&s;&s;ible, le&s;s "reli&s;h of &s;alvation" in it than the hypocri&s;y, in the degree that it is a greater turpitude to be earne&s;t in a vile cau&s;e than &s;imply to <HI>affect</HI> compa&s;&s;ion in a good one. In this matter, however, the affectation is intended to give a colour to the earne&s;tne&s;s. When a plunderer wants an apology, (in a ca&s;e of &s;elf-intere&s;t,) pity, (I mean a piteous prayer, which is extremely cheap) about the intere&s;t of others&mdash;Pity, has a mighty convenient mantle to throw over the &s;houlders, and accordingly the plunderer always makes a &s;poil of it (among&s;t the re&s;t of the pillage) to cover him&s;elf, and his real de&s;igns. Unluckily, however, in the pre|&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s, the mantle is too thin: The noble per&s;onage in que&s;tion has, in the cour&s;e of a long life and reign, had &s;o many occa&s;ions to put it on and throw it off, ju&s;t as it became com|modious or trouble&s;ome, that it is thread-bare in &s;ome places, and torn in others; and though the &s;ublime wearer is dre&s;s'd in it at this very moment, all the world can <HI>&s;ee through it.</HI></P>
<P>I have been at &s;ome pains to <HI>glean</HI> the great per&s;onage above mentioned, and have picked up &s;ome curious anecdotes. And not a few on this very &s;ubject, and <HI>hypocri&s;y in benevolence;</HI> the public and private in&s;tances of which will amu&s;e you when we meet; and the whole of which delectable Gleaning is calculated to prove that "<HI>all which gli&s;ters is not gold;</HI>" and that when a foreign trumpeter (who&s;e breath belongs to the power who paid for the trumpet, or commanded it to be blown) &s;ounds a vol|ley&mdash;I can by no means call it a <HI>voluntary</HI>&mdash;about magnificent pre&s;ents, jewel boxes, picture in brilliants, &amp;c. each of immen&s;e value, it ought to be told at the &s;ame time, that in certain parts of the world there are mines of &s;parkling trumpery which the <HI>&s;lave digs,</HI> and the <HI>tyrant</HI> gives away, ju&s;t as any would-be|thought generous per&s;on in our own country might be&s;tow Bri&s;tol &s;tones and pa&s;s them off for diamonds! In doing which there &s;eems to be no great danger, as the receiver, conceiving the gift a mark of honour, mu&s;t &s;tarve rather than di&s;po&s;e of it. But &s;ome men there are who do not choo&s;e to carry the point of honour quite &s;o far; and who maintain that the laws of &s;elf|pre&s;ervation are &s;tronger and more binding than tho&s;e of deli|cacy. On this right of nature, it has come to the ears of the Gleaner, that certain per&s;ons have, in the la&s;t extremity, <HI>parted</HI> with their &s;uperb keep-&s;akes and love-tokens received from the graciou&s;ly imperial hands in que&s;tion, and found like the jug|gler's trick:
<Q><L>"Shake but the bag, and all &s;eems fair,</L>
<L>"The fingers &s;pread&mdash;and <HI>nothing's there.</HI>"</L></Q> We know that in &s;ome hands both abroad and at home, this juggling art has
<Q>"Rais'd both fortune and renown."</Q> And that VICE per&s;onified in a <HI>female</HI> character was the be&s;t jug|gler after all. In a &s;tory that I know, of a &s;word &s;et, or <HI>&s;aid</HI> to be &s;et, with brilliants of the fir&s;t water, according to court|arithmetic worth 5000 florins, the ever honoured receiver <HI>wanting bread,</HI> could, with difficulty, get enough to purcha&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ve and twenty loaves! and a &s;plendid ring from the &s;ame ever|honoured giver, e&s;timated at 2600 l. &s;terling, was pronounced by a famous jeweller to have co&s;t about 200l. In &s;hort, the Gleaner has, with very few variations, had occa&s;ion to apply every in&s;tance of Slight in the fable, and thinks that the illu&s;tri|ous juggler above-mentioned might exclaim with better preten|&s;ions than Gay's trick&s;ter:
<Q><L>"Who dares with me di&s;pute the prize,</L>
<L>"<HI>In juggling I &s;ubmit to none!</HI>"</L></Q> But then this per&s;onage has the rea&s;on to give which triumphant vice her&s;elf made u&s;e of, and every &s;ubordinate trick&s;ter, crown'd or ancrown'd, might ob&s;erve
<Q><L>"How practice has improv'd her hand,</L>
<L>"But now and then <HI>we</HI> cheat the throng!</L>
<L>"<HI>She</HI> every day, and all day long."</L></Q> But it is a tempting theme, and I am breaking into my Corps de Re&s;erve.</P></NOTE> as unque&s;tionably did that of France,
<PB N="322" REF="333">under the &s;anctions of rea&s;on, honour, public good, and the cau&s;e of religion. But, nine
<PB N="323" REF="334">times out of ten, it degenerates into a mere per&s;onal quarrel, in which public good, and
<PB N="324" REF="335">every other generous motive is, forgotten, to make way for the gratification of private am|bition, avarice, and hatred. The original cau&s;e in the ab&s;orbing ferment of party is &s;peedily &s;wallowed up: what was principle becomes pa&s;&s;ion. Or what at the commencement was a brave and daring conte&s;t betwixt the governors, for prerogative and the governed for privilege, &mdash;a determined a&s;&s;ertion of real or &s;uppo&s;ed rights on the one hand, and of natural claims on the other at length &s;ettles into a mere party madne&s;s. And the in&s;anity is contagious. Every body catches it. Men, women, and children rave about it. The time of rea&s;on|ing is pa&s;t, con&s;equently the time of entering its cau&s;es. It is then the bu&s;ine&s;s of the indi|vidual whatever be his party to follow where that leads, to defeat or victory, to life or death. In the feveri&s;h paroxi&s;m of indignation, each per&s;on ea&s;ily per&s;uades him&s;elf his quarrel is ju&s;t; every angry man imagines he has a good
<PB N="325" REF="336">rea&s;on to be &s;o; and the more we are wan|dering from the right, the more violently and inveterately we in&s;i&s;t that the objects of our di&s;plea&s;ure and enmity are in the wrong: and in public as well as private contention the tran&s;ition from generous &s;trife to illiberal rancour is almo&s;t immediate, the &s;lighte&s;t wound &s;oon turns into a gangrene. Each per&s;on be|comes odious to one party and honoured by the other, as he gives proof of &s;teadine&s;s to his own cau&s;e. The ma&s;&s;acre is called patrioti&s;m on the one hand, and loyalty on the other, and very frequently the object fir&s;t in contention, like the &s;quabble betwixt the two dogs and the &s;hadow, is not worth having: but, meantime, it is fought for as fiercely as if it was the one thing nece&s;&s;ary to our comfort in this world, and our &s;alvation in the next. In the end, the point is given up, and when accounts are cool enough to be reduced to rules of arithmetic, it u&s;ually turns out, that, in point of damages, each party has &s;uffered in blood and money from thou&s;ands up to millions, and on the credit &s;ide we have nothing to &s;hew for them but units and cyphers.</P>
<P>On fair calculation, therefore, my friend, whatever advantage may be derived to po&s;terity,
<PB N="326" REF="337">little is to be gained by the pre&s;ent generation: Since, after every ten years war, (I mean a civil war of cour&s;e) &s;o much havock has been done to property in general, and the pa&s;&s;ions of hatred have &s;o rankled in the heart, privately &s;peaking, again&s;t friends, neighbours, and fa|milies (even in the mi&s;erable &s;eptennial &s;quabble about elections, this is manife&s;t) that I que&s;tion much whether there is a being on the face of the earth, (except the &s;tock-jobbers, fore&s;tallers, agents, and other vultures in &s;ociety, who thrive in time of public calamity,) can expect to be the better for it. The ravages u&s;ually drain the be&s;t blood, fortunes, and feelings of the country, for, at lea&s;t, half a century: and &s;uppo&s;ing there is then a regeneration, with &s;ome few benefits that were not before en|joyed, we &s;hall probably have lo&s;t many that were better before the reform began. Be&s;ides the melancholy con&s;ideration that our po&s;terity will look upon the party and per&s;onal love and hate, that has de&s;cended to them, as part of their inheritance, our im|mediate offspring will have been educated in all the prejudices of our own particular party, and the next age will lo&s;e little or nothing of hereditary attachment to one &s;ide, and ill-will
<PB N="327" REF="338">to another, while remoter generations will trace the hi&s;tory of their forefathers, and make what the politics or fa&s;hion of the day &s;et down as rights and wrongs, the cau&s;e of new murmurs, new exactions, new rebellions, new patrioti&s;ms, and, in fine, the &s;parks that will be found in &s;tirring up the embers and a&s;hes of the old world, &s;hall &s;erve as a match to burn down the new. And, knowing, my friend, what we know of the di&s;contented, repining, &s;pirit of man, (knowing that even if God him|&s;elf does not di&s;pen&s;e his &s;un&s;hine and his &s;howers, exactly in proportion to our fancied good, we rebel) have we not the experience of &s;everal thou&s;and years that the&s;e fires will be kindled up in human &s;ociety till the coming of that conflagration which
<Q><L>"Lightnings with the meteor's blaze con&s;pire,</L>
<L>"And darted downward &s;et the globe on fire."</L></Q></P>
<P>Far, however, am I from wi&s;hing to "check the genial current of the &s;oul" that a&s;pires to liberty. 'Tis the true &s;tate of nature, the genuine &s;pirit of life, the health, beauty and &s;upport of &s;ociety. We cannot even extend our ideas beyond the &s;phere of this world, and rai&s;e them to another without &s;uppo&s;ing that <HI>perfect freedom</HI> is the ba&s;is of immortal felicity.
<PB N="328" REF="339">A de&s;potic heaven is a contradiction in terms; indeed the generous &s;truggles of human beings for liberty, when wanton cruelty no longer deba&s;es her cau&s;e, are but a&s;&s;ertions of the divine part of our nature. Tho&s;e jarring atoms which &s;hake a nation and which are, perhaps, in&s;eparable from revolutions, give way to wi&s;e, whole&s;ome, and humane arrange|ments; and when order is called out of that political chaos, though humanity mu&s;t ever &s;hudder at the dire effect of tho&s;e convul&s;ions which have preceded &s;uch arrangements, as tyrants &s;eldom long &s;urvive their victims, we mu&s;t venerate the "end while we never cea&s;e to deplore &s;ome of the means by which it has been brought about."</P>
<P>In fine, applying the&s;e general ob&s;ervations to the particular in&s;tance before us of the French people:

<L>"&mdash;When the dread thir&s;t of blood is o'er,</L>

<P>HUMANITY, OR, THE RIGHTS OF NATURE, A POEM; IN TWO BOOKS. A NEW EDITION: CORRECTED BY THE AUTHOR.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="preface">
<PB REF="342">
<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT I ventured abroad many years &s;ince under the title of SYMPATHY&mdash;a poem, which, on account of the intere&s;ts created in the heart, by the &s;ubject it&s;elf, was received by the public with &s;o much generous warmth&mdash; was INTENDED to &s;erve as a preliminary to what I had farther to ob&s;erve on SOCIETY, or a pro&s;pect of the HUMAN RACE, under the com|bined influences of CLIME and GOVERNMENT, RELIGIONS, LAWS, and LIBERTIES&mdash;From the&s;e, the tran&s;ition to TYRANNY was natural and &s;trongly in connexion; and from TYRANNY, I felt my&s;elf called upon by all the awakened emotions of HUMANITY, to con&s;ider SLAVERY; but not only that &s;pecies of it which con&s;i&s;ts in buying and &s;elling our <HI>Fellow-Creatures</HI> in
<PB N="334" REF="343">Africa&mdash;BUT EVERY OTHER KIND, in EVERY OTHER PLACE. Views, therefore, of FREEDOM and BONDAGE, throughout the different parts of the globe, have been taken, as well from experience, as the be&s;t hi&s;torical evidence.</P>
<P>How far the <HI>entire Abolition,</HI> &s;o warmly contended for by the &s;upporters of this mea|&s;ure, may be con&s;i&s;tent with human policy, it is not my purpo&s;e particularly to enquire, It is not the <HI>name</HI> of Slave in <HI>it&s;elf,</HI> which produces the great mi&s;chief. An hired &s;ervant in Europe may be as little at his own com|mand, and de&s;tined to as hard labour as a purcha&s;ed Negro in Africa; but the e&s;&s;ential difference con&s;i&s;ts in the one being guarded by the laws of the land, which &s;pread be|fore his per&s;on and his property a &s;hield that defends him from every <HI>abu&s;e of power;</HI> and the other is left naked and defencele&s;s to the "in&s;olence of office."</P>
<P>HUMANITY requires that the RIGHTS OF NATURE &s;hould be enjoyed by every <HI>Human
<PB N="335" REF="344">Being.</HI> It is therefore again&s;t the &s;hocking barbarity,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I am glad, however, to have it in my power to ob&s;erve, that we have not &s;uffered the HUMANITY of the French and other nations to &s;urpa&s;s our own, at lea&s;t in <HI>one</HI> of our i&s;lands, as the following authentic extract from the Jamaica Councils will atte&s;t, dated <HI>November</HI> 29th, 1787.</P>
<P>"This day the Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly went into a Committee on the Con&s;olidated Slave Bill, and continued &s;itting upwards of three hours; we under&s;tand, that by this Bill the whole &s;y&s;tem of the law re&s;pecting Negrees, is entirely changed, a Council of Protection is e&s;tabli&s;hed in each pari&s;h, and many humane provi&s;ions are introduced for rendering their condition ea&s;y and happy; it is al&s;o made felony, without benefit of clergy, to murder a Slave; a clau&s;e, which, to the great honour of the Hou&s;e, pa&s;&s;ed without a &s;ingle di&s;&s;enting voice."</P></NOTE> the unque&s;tionable cruelty, and the too well atte&s;ted horror, growing out of the&s;e, that I &s;till contend.&mdash;An abolition of <HI>the&s;e enormities</HI> is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. For the re&s;t, whether the commerce flouri&s;hes or falls, is a matter of no moment to the Philanthropi&s;t: without engaging in the heats of political con|trover&s;y; without attending to the pleas of intere&s;t on the one &s;ide, or the &s;allies of enthu&s;ia&s;tic zeal (though generous in its ex|ce&s;&s;es) on the other, it is &s;ufficient to Him that the happine&s;s of the <HI>&s;pecies</HI> in <HI>general,</HI> is
<PB N="336" REF="345">made independent on the tyranny of <HI>particular individuals,</HI>&mdash;that the laws of <HI>&s;ubordination,</HI> in the different cla&s;&s;es of SOCIETY, &s;hould not violate the laws of <HI>humanity,</HI>&mdash;and that &s;o much of <HI>liberty</HI> &s;hould be allowed to every man, as to feel a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his being a link in the great chain of the community; and that till by &s;ome act of his own it is nece&s;|&s;ary for the <HI>good of the whole</HI> that he &s;hould be con&s;idered as an outca&s;t of &s;ociety, he is, by the Rights of nature and of Rea&s;on, entitled to protection from in&s;ult, mi&s;ery and death.&mdash; So far as the <HI>wealth</HI> can be reconciled to the <HI>happine&s;s</HI> of nations, and the E&s;tabli&s;hments of Civil <HI>Society</HI> to the Rights of Nature, every lover of his country mu&s;t &s;ub&s;cribe: at the &s;ame time, as the <HI>wealth of worlds</HI> cannot ju&s;tify the lea&s;t wanton in&s;raction of the <HI>laws of Humanity,</HI> whoever vainly attempts to &s;up|port an argument for the one, at the expence of the other, erects a building which hath its foundation in the &s;ands, and which mu&s;t tumble into ruins at the &s;lighte&s;t touch of Rea&s;on and of Truth.</P>
