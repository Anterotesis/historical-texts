<HEAD>To the Right Honourable CHARLES Earl of <HI>Dor&s;et</HI> and <HI>Middle&s;ex,</HI> Lord Chamberlain of His Maje&s;ty's Hou&s;hold, and Knight of the Mo&s;t Noble Order of the Garter, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A Young Poet is liable to the &s;ame Vanity and Indi&s;cre|tion with a Young Lover; and the Great Man that &s;miles upon one, and the Fine Woman that looks kindly upon t'other, are each of 'em in Danger of having the Favour publi&s;h'd with the fir&s;t Opportunity.</P>
<P>But there may be a different Motive, which will a little di&s;tingui&s;h the Offenders. For tho' one &s;hould have a Vani|ty in ruining another's Reputation, yet the other may only have an Ambition to advance his own. And I beg leave, my Lord, that I may plead the latter, both as the Cau&s;e and Excu&s;e of this Dedication.</P>
<P>Whoever is King, is al&s;o the Father of his Country; and as no Body can di&s;pute Your Lord&s;hip's <HI>Monarchy</HI> in <HI>Poetry;</HI> &s;o all that are concern'd, ought to acknowledge Your Uni|ver&s;al Patronage: And it is only pre&s;uming on the Privilege of a Loyal Subject, that I have ventur'd to make this my Addre&s;s of Thanks to your Lord&s;hip, which at the &s;ame time includes a Prayer for Your Protection.</P>
<P>I am not Ignorant of the Common Form of Poetical Dedications, which are generally made up of Panegyricks, where the Authors endeavour to di&s;tingui&s;h their Patrons, by the &s;hining Characters they give them above other Men. But that, my Lord, is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s at this time, nor is Your Lord&s;hip <HI>now</HI> to be di&s;tingui&s;h'd. I am contented
<PB REF="4">
with the Honour I do my &s;elf in this Epi&s;tle, without the Vanity of attempting to add to, or explain Your Lord&s;hip's Character.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s it is not without &s;ome &s;truggling, that I behave my &s;elf in this Ca&s;e as I ought: For it is very hard to be plea&s;ed with a Subject, and yet forbear it. But I chu&s;e ra|ther to follow <HI>Pliny</HI>'s Precept, than his Example, when in his Panegyrick to the Emperor <HI>Trajan,</HI> he &s;ays,
<Q><L>Nec minus con&s;iderabo quid aures ejus pati</L>
<L>po&s;&s;int, Quam quid virtutibus debeatur.</L></Q></P>
<P>I hope I may be excus'd the Pedantry of a Quotation, when it is &s;o ju&s;tly apply'd. Here are &s;ome Lines in the Print, (and which Your Lord&s;hip read before this Play was Acted) that were omitted on the Stage; and particularly one whole Scene in the Third Act, which not only helps the De&s;ign forward with le&s;s Precipitation, but al&s;o heightens the ridiculous Character of <HI>Fore&s;ight,</HI> which indeed &s;eems to be maim'd without it. But I found my &s;elf in great Danger of a long Play, and was glad to help it where I could. Tho' notwith&s;tanding my Care, and the kind Reception it had from the Town, I could heartily wi&s;h it yet &s;horter: But the Number of different Characters repre&s;ented in it, would have been too much crowded in le&s;s room.</P>
<P>This Reflection on Prolixity, (a Fault for which &s;carce any one Beauty will attone) warns me not to be tedi|ous now, and detain Your Lord&s;hip any longer with the Trifles of,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE> <SIGNED>Your Lord&s;hip's mo&s;t Obedient, and mo&s;t Humble Servant, William Congreve.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE. 
<STAGE>Spoken at the Opening of the New Hou&s;e, By Mr. <HI>Betterton.</HI></STAGE></HEAD>
<L>THE Husbandman in vain renews his Toil,</L>
<L>To cultivate each Tear a hungry Soil;</L>
<L>And fondly hopes for rich and generous Fruit,</L>
<L>When what &s;hou'd feed the Tree, devours the Root:</L>
<L>Th' unlanden Boughs, he &s;ees, bode certain Dearth,</L>
<L>Unle&s;s tran&s;planted to more kindly Earth.</L>
<L>So the poor Husbands of the Stage, who found</L>
<L>Their Labours lo&s;t upon th' ungrateful Ground,</L>
<L>This la&s;t and only Remedy have prov'd;</L>
<L>And hope new Fruit from ancient Stocks remov'd.</L>
<L>Well may they hope, when you &s;o kindly aid,</L>
<L>And plant a Soil which you &s;o rich have made.</L>
<L>As Nature gave the World to Man's fir&s;t Age,</L>
<L>So from your Bounty we receive this Stage;</L>
<L>The Freedom Man was born to you've re&s;tor'd,</L>
<L>And to our World &s;uch Plenty you afford,</L>
<L>It &s;eems like <HI>Eden,</HI> fruitful of its own Accord.</L>
<L>But &s;ince in <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> frail Fle&s;h gave way,</L>
<L>And when but two were made, both went a&s;tray;</L>
<L>Forbear your Wonder, and the Fault forgive,</L>
<L>If in our larger Family we grieve</L>
<L>One falling <HI>Adam,</HI> and one tempted <HI>Eve.</HI></L>
<L>We who remain, would gratefully repay</L>
<L>What our Endeavours can, and bring this Day,</L>
<L>The Fir&s;t-fruit Off'ring of a Virgin Play.</L>
<L>We hope there's &s;omething that may plea&s;e each Ta&s;te,</L>
<L>And tho' of homely Fare we make the Fea&s;t,</L>
<L>Yet you will find Variety at lea&s;t.</L>
<L><PB REF="8">
There's Humour, which for chearful Friends we got;</L>
<L>And for the thinking Party there's a Plot.</L>
<L>We've &s;omething too to gratifie ill Nature,</L>
<L>(If there be any here) and that is Satire.</L>
<L>Tho' Satire &s;carce dares grin, 'tis grown &s;o mild;</L>
<L>Or only &s;hews its Teeth, as if it &s;mil'd.</L>
<L>As A&s;&s;es Thi&s;tles, Poets mumble Wit;</L>
<L>And dare not bite, for fear of being bit.</L>
<L>They hold their Pens, as Swords are held by Fools,</L>
<L>And are afraid to u&s;e their own Edge-Tools.</L>
<L>Since the <HI>Plain-Dealer</HI>'s Scenes of Manly Rage,</L>
<L>Not one has dar'd to la&s;h this Crying Age.</L>
<L>This time, the Poet owns the bold E&s;&s;ay,</L>
<L>Yet hopes there's no ill Manners in his Play:</L>
<L>And he declares by me, he has de&s;ign'd</L>
<L>Affront to none, but frankly &s;peaks his Mind.</L>
<L>And &s;hou'd th' en&s;uing Scenes not chance to hit,</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE, 
<STAGE>Spoken at the Opening of the New Hou&s;e. By Mrs. <HI>Bracegirdle.</HI></STAGE></HEAD>
<L>SURE Providence, at fir&s;t, de&s;ign'd this Place</L>
<L>To be the Player's Refuge in Di&s;tre&s;s;</L>
<L>For &s;till in every Storm they all run hither,</L>
<L>As to a Shed, that &s;hields 'em from the Weather.</L>
<L>But thinking of this Change which la&s;t befel us,</L>
<L>It's like what I have heard our Poets tell us:</L>
<L>For when behind our Scenes their Suits are pleading,</L>
<L>To help their Love, &s;ometimes they &s;how their Reading;</L>
<L>And wanting ready Ca&s;h to pay for Hearts,</L>
<L>They top their Learning on us, and their Parts.</L>
<L>Once of Philo&s;ophers they told us Stories,</L>
<L>Whom, as I think, they call'd<HI>&mdash;Py&mdash;Pythagories.</HI></L>
<L>I'm &s;ure 'tis &s;ome &s;uch <HI>Latin</HI> Name they give 'em,</L>
<L>And we, who know no better, mu&s;t believe 'em.</L>
<L>Now to the&s;e Men (&s;ay they) &s;uch Souls were given,</L>
<L>That after Death ne'er went to Hell nor Heaven,</L>
<L>But liv'd, I know not how, in Bea&s;ts; and then,</L>
<L>When many Years were pa&s;t, in Men again.</L>
<L>Methinks, we <HI>Players</HI> re&s;emble &s;uch a Soul,</L>
<L>That does from Bodies, we from Hou&s;es &s;troll.</L>
<L>Thus <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s Soul, of old that was,</L>
<L>May now be damn'd to animate an A&s;s;</L>
<L>Or in this very Hou&s;e, for ought we know,</L>
<L>Is doing painful Pennance in &s;ome <HI>Beau:</HI></L>
<L>And this our Audience, which did once re&s;ort</L>
<L>To &s;hining Theatres to &s;ee our Sport,</L>
<L>Now find us to&s;s'd into a Tennis-Court.</L>
<L>The&s;e Walls but t'other Day were fill'd with Noi&s;e</L>
<L>Of roaring Game&s;ters, and your <HI>Damme Boys:</HI></L>
<L>Then bounding Balls and Rackets they encompa&s;s'd,</L>
<L>And now they're fill'd with Je&s;ts, and Flights, and Bomba&s;t!</L>
<L>I vow, I don't much like this Tran&s;migration,</L>
<L>Strolling from Place to Place, by Circulation.</L>
<L>Grant, Heaven, we don't return to our fir&s;t Station.</L>
<L>I know not what the&s;e think, but for my Part,</L>
<L>I can't reflect without an aking Heart,</L>
<L>How we &s;hould end in our Original, a Cart.</L>
<L>But we can't fear, &s;ince you're &s;o good to &s;ave us,</L>
<L>That you have only &s;et us up to leave us.</L>
<L>Thus from the pa&s;t, we hope for future Grace,</L>
<L>I beg it&mdash;</L>
<L>And &s;ome here know I have a begging Face.</L>
<L>Then pray continue this your kind Behaviour,</L>
<L>For a clear Stage won't do, without your Favour.</L>

<SPEAKER>Sir Samp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Odd, you are hard to plea&s;e, Madam; to find a young Fellow that is neither a Wit in his own Eye, nor a Fool in the Eye of the World, is a very hard Task. But, Faith and Troth, you &s;peak very di&s;creetly; for I hate both a Wit and a Fool.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>She that marries a Fool, Sir <HI>Samp&s;on,</HI> commits the Re|putation of her Hone&s;ty or Under&s;tanding to the Cen&s;ure of the World: And &s;he that marries a very witty Man, &s;ubmits both to the Severity and in&s;olent Conduct of her Husband. I &s;hould like a Man of Wit for a Lover, becau&s;e I would have &s;uch an one in my Power; but I would no more be his Wife than his Enemy. For his Malice is not a more terrible Con&s;equence of his Aver&s;ion, than his Jealou&s;ie is of his Love.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Samp.</SPEAKER>
<P>None of old <HI>Fore&s;ight</HI>'s <HI>Sybills</HI> ever utter'd &s;uch a Truth.

<P>Well, Madam, you have done Exemplary Ju&s;tice, in pu|ni&s;hing an inhuman Father, and rewarding a faithful Lover: But there is a third good Work, which I, in particular, mu&s;t thank you for; I was an Infidel to your Sex, and you have converted me&mdash;For now I am convinc'd that all Women are not like Fortune, blind in be&s;towing Favours, either to tho&s;e who do not merit, or who do not want 'em.</P>

<P>'Tis an unrea&s;onable Accu&s;ation, that you lay upon our Sex: You tax us with Inju&s;tice, only to cover your own want of Merit.
