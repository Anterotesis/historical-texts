<SPEAKER>Dimity.</SPEAKER>
<P>PO! Po!&mdash;no &s;uch thing&mdash;I tell you, Mr. Woodley, you are a mere novice in the&s;e affairs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but li&s;ten to rea&s;on, Mrs. Dimity,&mdash; has not your ma&s;ter, Mr. Drugget, invited me down to his country-&s;eat, in order to give me his daughter Nancy in marriage; and with what pretence can he now break off?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>What pretence!&mdash;you put a body out of all patience&mdash;But go on your own way, Sir; my advice is all lo&s;t upon you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do me inju&s;tice, Mrs. Dimity&mdash;your advice has governed my whole conduct&mdash;Have not I &s;ixed an intere&s;t in the young lady's heart?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>An intere&s;t in a fiddle&s;tick!&mdash;you ought to have made love to the father and mother&mdash;what, do you think the way to get a wife, at this time of day, is by &s;peaking &s;ine things to the lady you have a fancy for? &mdash;That was the practice, indeed; but things are alter'd now&mdash;you mu&s;t addre&s;s the old people, Sir; and never trouble your head about your mi&s;tre&s;s&mdash;None of your
<PB N="4" REF="4">letters, and ver&s;es, and &s;oft looks, and fine &s;peeches, &mdash; <Q>Have compa&s;&s;ion, thou angelic creature, on a poor dying</Q>&mdash;P&s;haw! &s;tuff! non&s;en&s;e! all out of fa&s;hion, &mdash;Go your ways to the old curmudgeon, humour his whims&mdash; <Q>I &s;hall e&s;teem it an honour, Sir, to be allied to a gentleman of your rank and ta&s;te.</Q> <Q>Upon my word, he's a pretty young gentleman.</Q>&mdash;Then wheel about to the mother: <Q>Your daughter, Ma'am, is the very model of you, and I &s;hall adore her for your &s;ake.</Q> <Q>Here, come hither, Nancy, take this gentleman for better for wor&s;e.</Q> <Q>La, mama, I can never con&s;ent.</Q>&mdash; <Q>I &s;hould not have thought of your con&s;ent&mdash;the con&s;ent of your relations is enough: why, how now, hu&s;&s;ey!</Q> So away you go to church, the knot is tied, an agree|able honey-moon follows, the charm is then di&s;&s;olv'd; you go to all the clubs in St. James's Street; your lady goes to the Coterie; and, in a little time you both go to Doctor's Commons; and, if faults on both &s;ides prevent a divorce, you'll quarrel like contrary elements all the re&s;t of your lives: that's the way of the world now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you know, my dear Dimity, the old couple have received every mark of attention from me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Attention! to be &s;ure you did not fall a&s;leep in their company; but what then?&mdash;You &s;hould have entered into their characters, play'd with their hu|mours, and &s;acrificed to their ab&s;urdities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if my temper is too frank&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Frank, indeed! yes, you have been frank enough to ruin your&s;elf.&mdash;Have not you to do with a rich old &s;hop-keeper, retired from bu&s;ine&s;s with an hundred thou&s;and pounds in his pocket, to enjoy the du&s;t of the London road, which he calls living in the country&mdash;and yet you mu&s;t find fault with his &s;ituation! &mdash;What if he has made a ridiculous gimcrack of his hou&s;e and gardens, you know his heart is &s;et upon it; and could not you have commended his ta&s;te? But you mu&s;t be too frank!&mdash; <Q>Tho&s;e walks and alleys are too regular&mdash;tho&s;e evergreens &s;hould not be cut
<PB N="5" REF="5">into &s;uch fanta&s;tic &s;hapes.</Q>&mdash;And thus you advi&s;e a poor old mechanic, who delights in every thing that's mon&s;trous, to follow nature&mdash;Oh, you're likely to be a &s;ucce&s;sful lover!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why &s;hould I not &s;ave a father-in-law from being a laughing-&s;tock?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Make him your father-in-law fir&s;t&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, he can't open his windows for the du&s;t &mdash;he &s;tands all day looking through a pane of gla&s;s at the carts and &s;tage-coaches as they pa&s;s by, and he calls that living in the fre&s;h air, and enjoying his own thoughts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>And could not you let him go on his own way? You have ruin'd your&s;elf by talking &s;en&s;e to him; and all your non&s;en&s;e to the daughter won't make amends for it.&mdash;And then the mother; how have you play'd your cards in that quarter?&mdash;She wants a tin&s;el man of fa&s;hion for her &s;econd daughter&mdash;"Don't you &s;ee (&s;ays &s;he) how happy my elde&s;t girl is made by marrying Sir Charles Rackett. She has been married three entire weeks, and not &s;o much as one angry word has pa&s;s'd between them&mdash;Nancy &s;hall have a man of quality too."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet I know Sir Charles Rackett per|fectly well.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, &s;o do I; and I know he'll make his lady wretched at la&s;t&mdash;But what then? You &s;hould have humour'd the old folks,&mdash;you &s;hould have been a talking empty fop, to the good old lady, and to the old gentleman, an admirer of his ta&s;te in gardening. But you have lo&s;t him&mdash;he is grown fond of this beau Lovelace, who is here in the hou&s;e with him; the coxcomb ingratiates him&s;elf by flattery, and you're undone by frankne&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, Dimity, I won't de&s;pair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dim.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet you have rea&s;on to de&s;pair; a million of rea&s;ons&mdash;To-morrow is fix'd for the wedding-day; Sir Charles and his lady are to be here this very night&mdash; they are engag'd, indeed, at a great rout in town, but they take a bed here, notwith&s;tanding.&mdash;The family is &s;itting up for them; Mr. Drugget will keep you
<PB N="6" REF="6">all up in the next room there, till they arrive&mdash;and to-morrow the bu&s;ine&s;s is over&mdash;and yet you don't de&s;pair!&mdash;hu&s;h!&mdash;hold your tongue; here comes Lovelace.&mdash;Step in, and I'll devi&s;e &s;omething, I warrant you. <STAGE>(<HI>Exit</HI> Woodley)</STAGE> The old folks &s;hall not have their own way&mdash;'tis enough to vex a body, to &s;ee an old father and mother marrying their daugh|ter as they plea&s;e, in &s;pite of all I can do.</P>

<P>Oh! perfectly, Sir; they gratify my ta&s;te of all things. One &s;ees villas where nature reigns in a wild kind of &s;implicity; but then they have no ap|pearance of art, no art at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Very true, rightly di&s;tingui&s;h'd:&mdash;now mine is all art; no wild nature here; I did it all my&s;elf.</P>

<P>What, had you none of the great proficients in gardening to a&s;&s;i&s;t you?</P>

<SPEAKER>Drug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no&mdash;they have got into a fal&s;e ta&s;te. I bought that bit of ground, the other &s;ide of the road&mdash; and it looks very pretty&mdash;I made a duck-pond there, for the &s;ake of the pro&s;pect.</P>
