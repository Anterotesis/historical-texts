<HEAD>AN EASY WAY TO PROLONG LIFE.</HEAD>
<P>HEALTH being the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing upon earth, it is natural to imagine, we &s;hould be &s;tudious to pre&s;erve it; and yet, if we take a view of the actions and conduct of mankind in general, we are led to &s;uppo&s;e that it is not the greate&s;t good. In&s;tead of paying any regard to it, we frequently indulge our appetites, at the expence of our con&s;titutions. The human body is a piece of mechani&s;m, that requires care and attention. It may be com|pared to clock-work, which, if not kept free from du&s;t and other extraneous, injurious &s;ub&s;tances, will pre&s;ently be out of order. Life is, generally &s;peaking, &s;hortened or pro|longed, according to the care we take of it.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t age of the world, the life of man was nearly a thou&s;and years; but after the flood,
<PB N="2" REF="5">it was abreviated to half its length. Three gene|rations later, it was reduced to one fourth of its original term, and man &s;eldom lived above two hundred years. About the time of Mo&s;es, it became &s;horter &s;till, commonly not exceeding one hundred and twenty years, and now, it is reduced to little more than half that period.</P>
<P>But, though we find this gradual declen&s;ion in the &s;everal ages of the world; yet we mu&s;t under&s;tand, that it was not <HI>equally</HI> &s;o, in all parts, at the &s;ame time; for difference of cli|mate, and difference of living, cau&s;ed a dif|ference in the length of life. Hence, &s;ome of the inhabitants of the earth lived three times or four times as long as others.</P>
<P>Now, why the days of man &s;hould be thus &s;hortened, and his term of life &s;o much re|duced, is an object worth our enquiry: and, if we compare the manner of our living now, with that of the fir&s;t age of the world, we &s;hall &s;ee evident rea&s;ons for it; every generation hav|ing, more and more, impaired its con&s;titution by a degenerate cour&s;e of living, incompatible with the laws of nature. And as we mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity, admit of hereditary infirmities, we have rea&s;on to expect, (unle&s;s by great refor|mation of the injurious cu&s;toms of later ages,) that life in future will be &s;horter &s;till.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="6">'Tis true, there is another rational cau&s;e, namely, that when the number of men upon the earth was &s;mall, it was nece&s;&s;ary their life &s;hould be prolonged, for the purpo&s;es of popu|lation; but as they increa&s;ed, this became no longer nece&s;&s;ary, and the wi&s;dom of the Crea|tor found it requi&s;ite to &s;horten their days, le&s;t the earth &s;hould be over&s;tocked. For were men to live nine hundred years now, with the pre&s;ent encrea&s;e of the &s;pecies, there could not be provi&s;ion for one tenth part of their number. But, notwith&s;tanding this, it is a matter of melancholy con&s;ideration, to think, how much longer a man might live, with tem|perance, than he does, at pre&s;ent; and how &s;oon the gratification of a little momentary plea&s;ure hurries him out of life, perhaps to the de&s;truction of his family, and the lo&s;s of hap|pine&s;s hereafter.</P>
<P>In the infancy of the world, man &s;ought only after the nece&s;&s;ary requi&s;ites of his being, and was contented with that competent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, which nature required; but, in proce&s;s of time he grew di&s;&s;atisfied with the bare nece&s;&s;aries of life, (that whole&s;ome provi&s;ion that would have greatly prolonged it,) and hunted after variety and exce&s;s, to plea&s;e and gratify a
<PB N="4" REF="7">&s;en&s;ual appetite. Thus, one age taught ano|ther to be irregular and <HI>di&s;ordered,</HI> dictated new inventions to &s;ucceeding generations, and tran&s;|mitted their ruined practices to the following ages to imitate and compleat.</P>
<P><HI>Hinc illae lachrymae!</HI> &mdash; After this manner, and by &s;uch means, is the life of man be&s;et by innumerable infirmities and di&s;ea&s;es: thus, is he cut off, before he is well aware of it.</P>
<P>Now, as it is natural to man to covet length of life, we have rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, he will be glad to pay &s;ome attention to tho&s;e things, that will either prolong or &s;horten it; and, as length of life depends upon health, health is the principal thing to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>The practice of phy&s;ic was anciently di&s;tri|buted into three branches; the fir&s;t of which was confined to &s;urgery; the &s;econd, to the admini|&s;tration of internal remedies; the la&s;t, to a due re|gulation of diet. The two former have, in no age, received more u&s;eful improvement than in the pre&s;ent. But, it is greatly to be doubted, whether or not an attention has been paid to the latter, in proportion to its dignity and impor|tance.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="8">Many are the cau&s;es of ill health, but the prin|cipal one is the variety and exce&s;s of food. To this then, at pre&s;ent, we &s;hall turn our enquiries. But, before we proceed, it may not be unnece&s;&s;ary to give the reader &s;ome little in&s;ight into the na|ture of dige&s;tion and the properties of food in general.</P>
<P>When food is thrown down into a healthy &s;tomach, it naturally di&s;&s;olves and ferments, it being a natural property of the &s;tomach to pro|duce fermentation. The aliment being di&s;&s;olved and fermented, is again rendered &s;olid by the juices of the &s;tomach; and the nutritive fluid being ex|pelled from the &s;olid part, is pa&s;&s;ed into the inte&s;|tines, where it is ab&s;orbed by certain ve&s;&s;els that open into them, and is converted into blood. The remaining part of the food, being retained in the &s;tomach, during this proce&s;s, is afterwards eva|cuated. But this fermentation in the body is not exactly &s;imilar to fermentations out of the body; as, in fermentations out of the body, the air contained in the &s;ub&s;tances fermenting is let out, which may be found by experiment; but, this is not the ca&s;e in healthy per&s;ons and in proper food, within the body; fermentation there takes place without any extrication of air. In weak &s;tomachs, indeed, and in the dige&s;ting of
<PB N="6" REF="9">&s;ome particular foods, extrication of air will often &s;o di&s;tend the &s;tomach, as to occa&s;ion flatulencies and pain; but this is always irregular and un|natural.</P>
<P>Now, if &s;uch extrication of air &s;hould happen, or the food we take, be &s;uch as will not, in the &s;tomach, readily di&s;&s;olve, ferment, become &s;olid, or re-di&s;&s;olve; or, in &s;hort, if it be &s;uch as &s;hall, in any way, re&s;i&s;t the powers of the &s;tomach, dige&s;|tion will be imperfect, and the whole &s;y&s;tem di&s;|ordered; it being only &s;uch part of the food as is dige&s;ted, that nouri&s;hes the body.</P>
<P>If the dige&s;tive powers of the &s;tomach be weak, natural fermentation will not take place, but &s;uch fermentation as we ob&s;erve in flour, when mixt with ye&s;t, that is, the air in the &s;ub&s;tances we eat, will be extricated; and &s;ometimes to &s;uch a degree as to di&s;tend the &s;tomach greatly, and bring on, what is called wind, belchings and pain. In this ca&s;e vegetables will turn acid, and meat will pu|trify, before either of them are pa&s;&s;ed from the &s;to|mach. This occa&s;ions heart burn, a certain &s;ign of indige&s;tion; and, if this weakne&s;s of the &s;to|mach continues, and putrefaction runs to a great height, &s;ickne&s;s, vomiting, and purging will be the con&s;equence, and &s;ometimes fever. Now,
<PB N="7" REF="10">&s;hould any quantity of this putrid food be ab&s;orbed by the ve&s;&s;els, and, in its pa&s;&s;age thro' the body, be carried into the blood, it will weaken the whole &s;y&s;tem, and, if not timely prevented, bring on &s;uch a general putrefaction of the blood, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as to prove fatal.</P>
<P>If what we eat, be of hard dige&s;tion, that is, &s;uch as will not readily di&s;&s;olve, or break down, or ferment in the &s;tomach, either owing to the nature of the food, its hard texture, or the weakne&s;s of our dige&s;tive organs, it will remain too long, before it be pa&s;&s;ed off, and produce a &s;en&s;e of weight, fullne&s;s, oppre&s;&s;ion and cold; as is the ca&s;e with &s;alted meats in weak &s;tomachs. 'Tis the &s;ame, if it will not re-di&s;&s;olve, after it is coa|gulated or become &s;olid.</P>
<P>So again, if it be too ea&s;y of dige&s;tion; that is, if it be &s;uch as will not remain long enough in the &s;tomach, owing either to its want of tendency to become &s;olid again after it is di&s;&s;olved; or to the &s;trength of the &s;tomach preventing it, the nutri|tive part will not have time to &s;eparate, and the body will not be nouri&s;hed.</P>
<P>Further, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved that circulation is carried on by a contraction of the heart, driving the blood from its cavities into the blood-ve&s;&s;els,
<PB N="8" REF="11">which, immediately on receiving it, contract like|wi&s;e, and impel it on, thro' the whole round of the &s;y&s;tem, to the heart again. Now, if the heart and ve&s;&s;els contract too quick, or with too much force, it occa&s;ions a &s;trong, quick pul&s;e and fever, and will often throw the blood in &s;uch quantities upon the brain, which is a tender, delicate part, as to bring on Stupor, Apoplexy, Delirium, and Death: And, it is the property of &s;ome &s;ub&s;tances to &s;timulate or encrea&s;e this action of the heart and ve&s;&s;els; and of others, to dimini&s;h it. Food of a vi&s;cid, clammy nature, glary, like the white of an egg, will adhere to the &s;ides of the &s;tomach, and, by &s;o doing, throw the blood, from other parts of the body, in &s;uch quantities upon the brain as to oppre&s;s it, and &s;ometimes occa&s;ion Apoplexy. How this is brought about, is un|known; but experience &s;hews us that it is &s;o.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons have been &s;o di&s;ordered by eating mu&s;cles, which are of a vi&s;cid nature, that, without &s;ome timely a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they would have died. In the&s;e ca&s;es, the head &s;wells, the face becomes of a black red, the eyes are ready to &s;tart from their &s;ockets, and a Stupor &s;ucceeds; but by admini&s;ter|ing a vomit, and making the &s;tomach di&s;charge its contents, and by opening the jugular vein, the patient has &s;ometimes recovered.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="12">From hence it appears, that &s;ome kinds of food are whole&s;ome, others unwhole&s;ome, and that there is none univer&s;ally proper. It mu&s;t be adapted to the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Now, there is a period in the life of man, in which the organs of dige&s;tion are weak, and yet, at the &s;ame time, there is a nece&s;&s;ity for much nouri&s;hment. This period is infancy; for, as at this time, the body encrea&s;es fa&s;t, much nou|ri&s;hment is required to help and forward the growth: milk being naturally provided, and therefore probably adapted to it, we may &s;up|po&s;e it to be a food of ea&s;y dige&s;tion and con&s;i|derable nouri&s;hment. Examining then the pro|perties of milk, will give us &s;ome in&s;ight into the nature of food in general.</P>
<P>Milk is not a &s;imple &s;ub&s;tance; it is a mixture of three; namely, coagulable matter, expre&s;&s;ed oil, and &s;ugar. Coagulable matter is that which will unite, and become &s;olid, leaving the re&s;t thinner and more fluid, <HI>viz.</HI> the curd; and expre&s;&s;ed oil is &s;uch as can be procured from any &s;ub&s;tance by pre&s;&s;ing, as oil of almonds, olives, and the like: by expre&s;&s;ed oil, in milk, we un|der&s;tand the cream.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="13">The mo&s;t &s;imple food, then, does not appear to be the ea&s;ie&s;t of dige&s;tion; if it was, we &s;hould have expected that milk would have con&s;i&s;ted of one &s;ub&s;tance only.</P>
<P>That the coagulable matter is capable of af|fording con&s;iderable nouri&s;hment, may be gather|ed from our experiencing that animal mucilage nouri&s;hes the mo&s;t; mucilage being that &s;ub|&s;tance which has &s;ufficient moi&s;ture to keep it together: as, for example,&mdash;&s;ound, good meat.</P>
<P>This coagulable matter, in milk, is fluid indeed when taken, but there is a juice peculiar to the &s;tomach, very different from an acid, that ren|ders it &s;olid. We find the &s;tomach of a calf, though cleared of every thing that is acid, to have this property. An infu&s;ion of a few grains of the inner coat will coagulate or curdle &s;everal quarts of milk.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to chee&s;e, for I &s;hall not have a better opportunity to mention it, it has, in general, a co&s;tive quality; but it differs, in proportion to the quantity of oil, in the coagulable part. The more rich, oily parts there are in chee&s;e, the more nutritive it is and &s;oluble: that is, the readier it will dige&s;t; the leaner the chee&s;e, the more dif|ficultly
<PB N="11" REF="14">it dige&s;ts. Chee&s;e is liable to become rank and putrid, we mu&s;t then con&s;ider it as having all the effects of animal food, when advanced to putrefaction; at this time it cea&s;es to be nutri|tive, and can only be con&s;idered as an a&s;&s;i&s;tant to dige&s;tion, Chee&s;e, indeed, as food, is only fit for the laborious and robu&s;t.</P>
<P>Having mentioned chee&s;e, let me drop a word or two upon butter. A quantity of pure cream eaten, is undoubtedly unwhole&s;ome; being, from its di&s;po|&s;ition to get acid and rancid, very difficult of dige&s;t|ion; but, in the form of butter, it may be u&s;ed with advantage. 'Tis a &s;trong nutriment, fit to ac|company our vegetable diet, e&s;pecially &s;uch vegetables as are naturally dry of them&s;elves; in this ca&s;e, it gives them the properties of rich, oily &s;ub&s;tances.&mdash;But, to return.</P>
<P>It appears then that milk, and of cour&s;e all other food, mu&s;t become &s;olid in the &s;tomach, and, after that, undergo a fre&s;h change, that is, be re|di&s;&s;olved, for dige&s;tion; for which purpo&s;e, it mu&s;t remain &s;ome time there, before it be pa&s;&s;ed off.</P>
<P>Now, that the expre&s;&s;ed oil, which is the cream, helps dige&s;tion, is evident from milk's not dige&s;t|ing &s;o well when it has been &s;kimmed, the
<PB N="12" REF="15">curd being harder; for the cream and the &s;ugar, being mixed with the curd, &s;eparate the different parts of it more from one another, &s;o that the natural fluid of the &s;tomach will penetrate the ea&s;ier, and fermentation go on the better
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If new milk is too rich or heavy for a child's &s;tomach, let it be diluted or mixed with water; it &s;hould never be &s;kimmed.</NOTE>. And as to &s;ugar, it, being from its nature more apt to ferment, will of cour&s;e facilitate dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>That expre&s;&s;ed oil affords nuch nouri&s;hment, we find from men and animals being able to live a long time upon nuts, almonds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;uch con|taining a quantity of this oil. But, expre&s;&s;ed oil alone produces &s;en&s;e of weight on the &s;tomach, owing to a relaxation it brings on, preventing the &s;tomach's contracting and expelling its load, and if taken in quantities, it will bring on &s;ickne&s;s.</P>
<P>That &s;ugar al&s;o affords great nouri&s;hment, is evident from animals thriving on the &s;hoots of young plants, which contain a great deal of &s;ugar; and from &s;ome negroes living wholly on the &s;ugar-cane. But &s;ugar alone is vi&s;cid, and, by ad|hering to the &s;ides of the &s;tomach, will &s;timulate it and di&s;order the &s;y&s;tem, and if diluted with any watery fluid, would be &s;o thin as not to be
<PB N="13" REF="16">retained in the &s;tomach long enough for dige&s;tion, but mixed with the coagulable part of the milk, it is &s;ufficiently retained. Either of the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances alone then, <HI>viz.</HI> coagulable matter, expre&s;&s;ed oil, or &s;ugar, would be <HI>hard</HI> of dige&s;tion; but blended, as in milk, they are <HI>ea&s;y</HI> of dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>Immediately after child-birth, when the milk begins to flow in the mother's brea&s;ts, it contains a larger quantity of &s;ugar and water (for there is always a &s;mall quantity of water) in proportion to the coagulable matter. Some months after child birth, the coagulable matter encrea&s;es, and the &s;ugar proportionably dimini&s;hes. For as the infant-&s;tomach is weak, the &s;olid part of the milk is, at fir&s;t, le&s;s, &s;o that a loo&s;er ma&s;s is formed, much ea&s;ier to be di&s;&s;olved. As the child grows &s;trong|er, its &s;tomach can bear more of this coagulable matter, and dige&s;ts it, if it be firmer. This points out, that a young child, one of a month old, will not thrive, in general, on brea&s;t-milk eight or nine months old.</P>
<P>We al&s;o learn from this, that weak &s;tomachs require food of ea&s;y dige&s;tion; &s;trong &s;tomachs, food of harder dige&s;tion. Thus, chicken, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> will nouri&s;h people mo&s;t, recovering from &s;ickne&s;s, and bacon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> will be&s;t recruit a labourer.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="17">Having thus far con&s;idered the properties of milk, the food Nature has de&s;igned for the infant|&s;tomach, we &s;hall be able to di&s;cover the whole|&s;omene&s;s of other foods, by examining <HI>their</HI> different properties; and we will begin with vegetables.</P>
<P>The vegetable &s;ub&s;tances capable of nouri&s;h|ing are as follow:</P>
<P N="1">1. Farrinaceous matter, or flour. This is ge|nerally contained in grain; but &s;ometimes we find it in the &s;tems of plants, and &s;ometimes in their roots.</P>
<P N="2">2. Vegetable mucilage: as for example, gum|arabic, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> That this is capable of nouri&s;hing, is evident from whole caravans living on it, for a long time, when they can procure no other food.</P>
<P N="3">3. Sugar.</P>
<P N="4">4. Expre&s;&s;ed oils. And,</P>
<P N="5">5. Native vegetable acid; or the juice of four fruits, which tends to take off the putre&s;cency of animal food: that is, to prevent meat from cor|rupting, while it continues in the &s;tomach.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="18">For animal food, without a mixture of vege|table, is apt to continue too long in the &s;tomach, before it ferments. In this ca&s;e, it will &s;ome|times begin to putrify before it be pa&s;&s;ed off, which putrefaction getting into the blood, will often bring on a putrefaction of all the fluids of the body. This is a complete &s;ea-&s;curvy, which, if not timely remedied, always terminates dread|fully. Salting provi&s;ions makes them harder of dige&s;tion; and though it prevents meat from corrupting &s;oon out of the body; yet, as the &s;alt &s;eldom if ever penetrates &s;ufficiently into the &s;ub&s;tance of the meat, &s;o as totally to &s;ecure it again&s;t putrefaction, when in the body, if it is not immediately made to ferment, by the addition of vegetable food, or &s;ome vegetable acid thrown in with it, it will be apt to putrify before it dige&s;ts, and contaminate the whole &s;y&s;tem. Hence we &s;ee, how liable mariners are, on a voyage, where there is a &s;carcity of vegetables, to be afflicted with the &s;curvy, and how &s;oon they get rid of that di&s;order, when they once get on &s;hore again, to the free u&s;e of herbs and roots.</P>
<P>Now, the&s;e five vegetable &s;ub&s;tances, I have mentioned, go naturally through fermentation, and are converted into blood.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="19">With re&s;pect to the fibres, the &s;olid part of vegetables, we find them frequently pa&s;s through the body, without being altered. As for example, peas and the &s;kins of goo&s;eberries, currants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now, as the texture of the &s;tronge&s;t tendons of animal food is con&s;tantly de&s;troyed in their pa&s;|&s;age through the body, while &s;uch parts of vegetable food &s;hall be evacuated as they were taken in, it is a que&s;tion, whether the&s;e la&s;t were dige&s;ted? If any of them are, it mu&s;t be &s;uch only as are young and tender.</P>
<P>But, to return. Farrinaceous matter is con|tained in the &s;eeds of all vegetables; but in many, it is &s;o mixed with other &s;ub&s;tances, as to be unfit for u&s;e. Thus, we find it in peas, beans, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but in too &s;mall quantities for the purpo&s;es of life.</P>
<P>So again, we meet with it in nuts; as wal|nuts, che&s;nuts, almonds, filberds, common nuts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But the&s;e contain too much oil to be whole&s;ome for common food. Be&s;ides, they yield a bitteri&s;h, a&s;tringent matter, which adds to their unwhole&s;omene&s;s. Bitter almonds, acorns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which contain a great deal of this matter, are more unwhole&s;ome &s;till. The oil, contained in nuts, will often give a &s;en&s;e of weight in the
<PB N="17" REF="20">&s;tomach, and &s;timulate the &s;y&s;tem during dige&s;|tion, e&s;pecially when eaten raw. Be&s;ides, the farrinaceous matter in them have a vi&s;cidity that renders them hurtful to the con&s;titution; but roa&s;ting them will de&s;troy this vi&s;cidity, and then they may be eaten &s;afely, and will afford much nouri&s;hment. They may be rendered ea&s;ier of dige&s;tion, by mixing them with flour. 'Tis the cocoa-nut, mixed with flour, that forms cho|colate.</P>
<P>Farrinaceous matter is found al&s;o in many roots, as in potatoes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;ometimes in the pith of trees, as in the palm-tree.</P>
<P>We u&s;e the pith of one tree, which we make into &s;ago, by moi&s;tening it with water, beating it up, &s;o as to &s;eparate it from the fibrous part of the tree, drying it into a cake, and afterwards reduc|ing it to powder. Thus, it becomes ea&s;y of dige&s;tion, and does not &s;timulate; but, &s;till, as it pa&s;&s;es off too &s;oon from the &s;tomach, it does not afford much nouri&s;hment. However, it is very proper food for weak &s;tomachs; as in fevers.</P>
<P>In the Ea&s;t, they eat rice; in England, wheat; in Germany, rye; in &s;ome parts, oats and barley; and in Africa, Indian wheat. This is
<PB N="18" REF="21">the grain commonly u&s;ed for food, and it appears to be well adapted to dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>Farrinaceous matter is, in its nature, &s;olid, capable of being di&s;&s;olved in water, and forming a jelly. If, before we di&s;&s;olve it in water, we expo&s;e it to heat, it coagulates or becomes &s;olid; thus, if we bake it, we convert it into bread; after which, it will not &s;o readily di&s;&s;olve. But bread di&s;&s;olved by long boiling, is le&s;s vi&s;cid than a &s;olution of flour would be; and con&s;equently more whole&s;ome. Was flour u&s;ed, with water, raw, it would be &s;o vi&s;cid as to clog and cloy the &s;tomach; we therefore prepare it to take off this vi&s;cidity.</P>
<P>Flour is not apt to undergo that fermentation in the &s;tomach, &s;o as &s;ufficiently to correct the putre&s;cency of animal food; we therefore ferment it fir&s;t; that is, we make it into bread. Another rea&s;on for our converting it into bread, is, that in fermentation, extrication of air takes place, which leaves a number of holes, making the bread &s;pungy; by which means, when eaten, it &s;oaks up the fluid of the &s;tomach, and facilitates dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>In order to coagulate the flour, that is, make
<PB N="19" REF="22">it into bread, and give it a whitene&s;s, which is the nature of all coagulants to do, bakers mix with it a quantity of allum, which, if not &s;o great as to give the bread a ta&s;te, can do no harm to adults; but a &s;mall quantity will do much mi&s;|chief to infants. Panada, therefore, for children, &s;hould by no means be made of bread in which any allum has been mixed. It is for this rea&s;on phy&s;icians pre&s;cribe bi&s;cuit-powder.</P>
<P>Sometimes bakers u&s;e whites of eggs, and &s;ometimes &s;pirits of wine, to coagulate the flour, as in French bread; the fir&s;t is innocent, and the la&s;t evaporates during the baking, and can produce no ill effect. For if bread is not per|fectly coagulated, it will &s;ometimes ferment a &s;econd time in the &s;tomach, particularly if it continues long, as in weak &s;tomachs, and turn &s;our; but baking it a &s;econd time will totally prevent this. Thus, ru&s;ks and toa&s;ted bread are often pre&s;cribed for di&s;ordered &s;tomachs, as being lea&s;t liable to do mi&s;chief; for the lea&s;t extrication of air in weak &s;tomachs is injurious.</P>
<P>But farrinaceous &s;eeds and roots are not &s;uffi|cient to correct the putre&s;cency of meat; we therefore make u&s;e of vegetables, that were not
<PB N="20" REF="23">originally de&s;igned for food, namely, potherbs. Of the&s;e,</P>
<P>The one &s;ort are cabbages, colliflowers, bro|coli, and all the varieties of this cla&s;s of plants. They contain naturally a &s;timulating oil, and a bitter a&s;tringent juice, &s;o as not to be fit for u&s;e; but we find this only in wild cabbages, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> By cultivation, this oil and bitter juice are de&s;troyed, and &s;uch as grow in our gardens con&s;i&s;t of little more than mucilage and &s;ugar; and, of cour&s;e, are fit for food.</P>
<P>The method taken to de&s;troy the&s;e noxious juices, is, to grow the plants in the dark, or, with as little air as po&s;&s;ible: this is done by planting them in a rich &s;oil, and thus making them &s;o luxuriant, that the leaves &s;hall embrace one another, by which means the body of the plant grows in the dark, and with little or no air. Hence the inner leaves become white, and are free from tho&s;e hurtful juices. The outer leaves may be eaten, but the inner ones are mo&s;t whole|&s;ome. So young plants are more whole&s;ome than old ones, as whatever of the&s;e juices they con|tain, they are not near &s;o rank.</P>
<P>Another kind of plants we u&s;e, are par&s;ley,
<PB N="21" REF="24">fennel, thyme, mint, &s;age, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;ome others of the &s;ame kind. The&s;e contain a &s;timulating oil, that would be injurious to the con&s;titution, if eaten in any quantity; and on that account are only u&s;ed as condiments with a &s;ea&s;oning to other foods. Cellery is of the &s;ame kind; but by earthing it up, and thus making it grow in the dark, and with little or no air, we de&s;troy its noxious oil. Wild cellery, if eaten, would bli&s;ter the mouth.</P>
<P>The &s;everal &s;pecies of onions, garlick, &s;halots, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are of another cla&s;s; we cannot de&s;troy the oil in the&s;e, but by boiling.</P>
<P>Lettuce, endive, dandelion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> contain much opium, and when wild are very bitter and di&s;|po&s;e to &s;leep, con&s;equently are unfit for food; but by cultivating them in rich &s;oils, and covering them from light and air, by tying them up, we render them whole&s;ome.</P>
<P>Spinnage, beets and other plants of that kind, when wild, contain al&s;o a very bitter oil, &s;o as not to be eatable; but by cultivation in rich &s;oils they lo&s;e this oil.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner, a&s;paragus contains oil &s;o
<PB N="22" REF="25">&s;timulating, that, if eaten wild, would bli&s;ter the tongue; but by cultivating it in rich ground and making u&s;e only of the young &s;hoots, we avoid this inconvenience: but I &s;hall take occa&s;ion to mention this and every other article more fully hereafter.</P>
<P>None of the&s;e plants alone afford much nou|ri&s;hment: we u&s;e them to correct the putre&s;cency of animal food, and particularly in the &s;ummer, as not &s;timulating.</P>
<P>They are apt to ferment, and turn &s;our in a weak &s;tomach, and in fermenting, will let loo&s;e the air contained in them, and occa&s;ion wind: when per&s;ons find this, they &s;hould refrain from eating them, till their &s;tomach grows &s;tronger; for by continuing to take down &s;uch things as di&s;agree with them, they not only di&s;order them|&s;elves for the pre&s;ent, but will, in time, &s;o injure their dige&s;tive organs, as to be hereafter at|tended with dreadful con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Peas, beans, kidney-beans, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are more fla|tulent or windy &s;till; e&s;pecially when eaten unripe, as is always done: &s;uch per&s;ons there|fore with whom they di&s;agree, &s;hould by no means eat them.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="26">With re&s;pect to e&s;culent roots; the&s;e contain mucilage, &s;ugar and farrinaceous matter, that is, flour. The two la&s;t afford much nouri&s;hment, but the mucilage does little el&s;e than forward fermentation. The more mucilaginous and watery the&s;e roots are, the more apt they are to ferment and correct the putre&s;cency of animal food, and con&s;equently the fitter to be eaten in warm wea|ther. But the more &s;ugar and flour they contain, the more they nouri&s;h.</P>
<P>Turneps, radi&s;hes, onions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are equally as liable to ferment and correct putre&s;cency, as the herbs &s;pringing from the&s;e roots; and as they contain a greater quantity of &s;ugar than their re|&s;pective herbs, they are more nutritive.</P>
<P>Carrots, par&s;neps, artichokes, Jeru&s;alem arti|chokes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> contain much &s;ugar and farrinaceous matter, but very little mucilage. The&s;e are whole&s;ome, nutritive, and ea&s;y of dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>The &s;ugar adds much to the nutritive quality of the farrinaceous matter in all the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances.</P>
<P>Potatoes, yams, earth-nuts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> contain flour almo&s;t alone, with very little &s;ugar, but more water than we find in farrinaceous &s;eeds. How|ever,
<PB N="24" REF="27">the farrinaceous matter is the &s;ame in both, and is coagulable by heat. We boil them and roa&s;t them, to de&s;troy their vi&s;cidity.</P>
<P>It was but lately that the&s;e roots were introduced into Europe for food. They are as nutritive as wheat flour, but cannot be &s;o well made into bread without a mixture of flour, as they will not readily ferment without &s;ome &s;uch mixture. One rea&s;on for our not growing them &s;o generally as wheat, is, that they are more apt to fail in the produce. The crop is not equally certain.</P>
<P>It is not yet determined, whether mu&s;hrooms are animals or vegetables. They have all the properties of animal-food, and mu&s;t be con&s;idered as &s;uch.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>FRUITS.</HEAD>
<P>FRUITS contain &s;ugar, native vegetable acid, and mucilage; and their &s;kins contain more or le&s;s an a&s;tringent juice; but &s;o little of it, as not to render them unwhole&s;ome. Nay, it is rather of &s;ervice, as it &s;timulates the &s;tomach, cau&s;es it to contract &s;trongly, and thus prevents the fruit becoming acid and flatulent. The
<PB N="25" REF="28">&s;ugar, acids and mucilage are capable of fer|menting and being converted into blood. As &s;ugar affords more nouri&s;hment than any other &s;ub&s;tance, &s;uch fruits as are &s;weete&s;t are the mo&s;t whole&s;ome, <HI>viz.</HI> figs, grapes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Sugar is even more nutritive than flour, but it is &s;eldom thoroughly dige&s;ted; being &s;o very &s;oluble, it pa&s;&s;es off from the &s;tomach before any change can take place in it, but entangled in the cells of fruit, it is retained longer in the &s;tomach, &s;o as to yield &s;ome nouri&s;hment. So again, it is not apt to ferment in the &s;to|mach alone, but mixed with the mucilage of fruits, fermentation readily takes place. Be&s;ides, the acid of fruits helps to correct the putrecency of animal food.</P>
<P>The more diluted &s;ugar is, the more apt it is to ferment. Hence, watry or mucilaginous fruits, with little &s;ugar, as goo&s;berries, currants, cherries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> afford but little nouri&s;hment, but then they tend more to correct putre&s;cency.</P>
<P>Such as contain much &s;ugar and le&s;s water and mucilage, are not &s;o apt to ferment, con|&s;equently are not &s;o proper to correct putrecency; but then they are more nutritive than &s;uch as
<PB N="26" REF="29">contain more mucilage and water, and le&s;s &s;ugar. They afford &s;o much nouri&s;hment, that in many countries they are u&s;ed as food: thus, figs, dates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in Portugal, are eaten as common food.</P>
<P>By evaporating the water from fruits, that is by drying them, we le&s;&s;en their di&s;po&s;ition to ferment, con&s;equently, we make them le&s;s flatulent and more nutritive.</P>
<P>The fermentation of &s;ome fruits in the &s;to|mach, have, by letting loo&s;e the air, &s;ometimes &s;o di&s;tended it as to prove fatal; but we may correct this by adding &s;ugar to them or &s;pices. However, &s;uch as find they di&s;agree with them, if they value their health, &s;hould refrain from eating them.</P>
<P>Fruits containing a great quantity of native vegetable acid, afford &s;o little nouri&s;hment, (as lemons, oranges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) that we &s;eldom u&s;e them, but as a power acting on the &s;tomach, to correct the bad properties of other food; as will be &s;hewn hereafter.</P>
<P>Sour fruits, eaten in autumn, have been ac|cu&s;ed of bringing on violent continued purgings, but without any rea&s;on. Indeed &s;ome four
<PB N="27" REF="30">fruits will act as purgatives, and the purging &s;hall continue; but this mu&s;t be owing to the &s;tate of the body, predi&s;po&s;ed to purge; for we find, that when fruit purges a body, not predi&s;po&s;ed to purge, no purging continues when the fruit is evacuated. In hot &s;ummers, when there is great plenty of fruit, dy&s;enteries or continued purgings are apt to be general, but this is owing to the heat of the weather; for per&s;ons will be afflicted with dy&s;entery, who eat no fruit. In &s;hort, in &s;uch di&s;orders they counteract; and tho&s;e who eat no fruit, are more apt to purge, than &s;uch as do. Nay, if large quantities of fruit &s;hould purge, it will not prove dan|gerous; it will act no further than as a do&s;e of phy&s;ic.</P>
<P>There is one &s;pecies of fruit very different from others, namely, cucumbers, melons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This fruit, either ripe or unripe, contains a great deal of mucilage of a particular kind. Break them in two, and you will &s;ee much of this muci|lage ooze out, &s;o as to glue the two parts firmly together. Now, this mucilage prevents the other parts of the fruit from fermenting, con&s;equently cau&s;es indige&s;tion, and brings on in the &s;tomach a &s;en&s;e of weight, coldne&s;s and &s;ickne&s;s; for though the &s;ub&s;tance be &s;oft, it will not readily
<PB N="28" REF="31">di&s;&s;olve. Cucumbers have been known to lie in the &s;tomach three days undige&s;ted. We are led to u&s;e them in the &s;ummer as cooling food; but they are very injurious to the con&s;titution. Be&s;ides, they contain a quantity of e&s;&s;ential oil, (which no vegetable &s;ub&s;tance does) very di&s;a|greeable and hurtful to a weak &s;tomach. If they are eaten, therefore, it &s;hould be with oil and pepper, as correctors of their noxious qualities. There is a natural bitter in the &s;kin of the cucum|ber, which will &s;erve to dige&s;t it, if eaten at the &s;ame time; but this &s;hould only be done when the cucumber is young, as it afterwards becomes injurious to the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>Having now treated of the properties and whole&s;omene&s;s of vegetable food, we will proceed next to animal; and herein we will fir&s;t con&s;ider the propriety of u&s;ing it.</P>
<P>It has been given as a rea&s;on for not u&s;ing animal food, that it was incon&s;i&s;tent with humanity. There can, however, be little diffi|culty about this, as there are a great num|ber of animals that mu&s;t live on animal food wholly, not being able to eat vegetable. It was therefore the intention of the Creator, that ani|mal food &s;hould be eaten. All that is to be con|&s;idered,
<PB N="29" REF="32">is, whether man is that animal that is de&s;tined to live upon animal food. The Pythagorean doctrine, heightened by &s;uper&s;ti|tion, has been a means of making numbers of people, <HI>viz.</HI> the whole of the Gentoos, the whole empire of Hindo&s;tan, and part of China, larger together than France, Spain, Italy, and Eng|land, wholly ab&s;tain from meat.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o to be ob&s;erved, that the race of parti|cular animals is &s;eldom dimini&s;hed, tho' we de&s;troy many of them; the increa&s;e of animals being much below what <HI>might</HI> be propagated. One man and one woman might, in the nature of things, have thirty children; but, in general, they may have ten, five boys and five girls. At every generation, then, were men propagated to the utmo&s;t, they could increa&s;e in number five times; &s;o that, in a very &s;hort time, a nation mu&s;t become exceedingly populous. It is the difficulty of procuring food, and obtaining the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniencies of life that prevents this propagation: A proof of the &s;uperintendency of Providence. Now as it is in man, &s;o is it in other animals. It is po&s;&s;ible for a &s;ow to bring forth ten pigs at every litter, &s;o that were this &s;pecies propagated to the utmo&s;t, in a few years, the increa&s;e would be prodigious. Ten|fold
<PB N="30" REF="33">in one year, and a thou&s;and-fold in ten years. Here al&s;o the difficulty of obtaining food prevents increa&s;e; there being always a de&s;ire of propa|gation between the &s;exes.</P>
<P>This is more evident, if we ob&s;erve the great increa&s;e of rats in a granary, where they multiply, in proportion to the quantity of corn there lodged.</P>
<P>The&s;e things con&s;idered, we may readily &s;ee, that in de&s;troying annually a number of any one &s;pecies of animals, &s;o far from dimini&s;hing that &s;pecies, we &s;hall rather increa&s;e it, as in &s;uch a ca&s;e, we &s;hall be anxious &s;o to do. So, by &s;ending a number of inhabitants out of a country, we do not depopulate that country, unle&s;s we exceed a certain bounds. Animals then living on one another, is the means of increa&s;ing animal life con&s;iderably: there can be, therefore, no rea&s;on why animal-food &s;hould not be u&s;ed. Let us examine, then, whether this food be proper.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t quadrupeds are confined naturally to par|ticular climates, and mo&s;t of them, in their or|gans of dige&s;tion, fitted for animal and vegetable food. Some have it only in their power to obtain animal food, and &s;ome only vegetable; but man
<PB N="31" REF="34">&s;eems de&s;tined to cover the whole face of the earth; no climate being yet di&s;covered unfit for <HI>his</HI> re&s;idence. His powers are fitted for animal as well as vegetable food, and his dige&s;tive organs equally adapted to both. And, if we con&s;ider mankind in their mo&s;t &s;imple &s;tate, where they are mo&s;t guided by in&s;tinct, we find as many &s;hepherds and hunters living on animal food, as hu&s;bandmen living on vegetable.</P>
<P>Animals de&s;tined to live on animal food, have their inte&s;tinal canal &s;horter than &s;uch as live on vegetable food. That is (in order to be under|&s;tood by &s;uch as are unacquainted with phy&s;ical terms) have le&s;s length of gut. And as longer retention in the &s;tomach is required for animal food than for vegetable, and man's dige&s;tive or|gans are adapted to this, it appears that man is de&s;tined to live equally on animal food, as vege|table. Further, the teeth of man are a medium between the teeth of carnivorous animals, and and tho&s;e of grameniverous. Be&s;ides, his health is better &s;upported by a mixture of the two, than it would be, was he to live upon one. The Lap|landers, indeed, live nine months on rein-deer, and the Greenlander lives upon fi&s;h: it is po&s;&s;i|ble, therefore, to live on animal food alone. How|ever,
<PB N="32" REF="35">were we obliged to live upon one &s;ort wholly, it would be be&s;t to live on vegetable; for animal food alone, would frequently bring on di&s;ea&s;es; a mixture therefore is be&s;t. In &s;hort, man is endowed with greater variety in his &s;y&s;tem and con&s;titution than any other animal, he being de&s;tined to live in all parts of the earth.</P>
<P>Let us next con&s;ider the differences between animal and vegetable food. Now, as we &s;aid before, fermentation which takes place in food, within the &s;tomach, is different from that which takes place out of it. If the &s;tomach then be weak, &s;o as not to bring on fermentation na|tural to it, the fermentation that would take place out of the &s;tomach, will take place in it. Hence it is, that in weak &s;tomachs, food turns acid and putrid. This fir&s;t occa&s;ions heart-burn, a &s;ure &s;ign of a weak &s;tomach; and if the putre|faction &s;hould run to a great height, the con&s;e|quence is &s;ickne&s;s, vomiting, purging, and &s;ome|times fever. And &s;hould a &s;mall quantity of &s;uch putrified matter, as was ob&s;erved before, be ab|&s;orbed by the ve&s;&s;els, in its pa&s;&s;age through the body, it will depre&s;s the &s;trength, and, without a timely remedy, cau&s;e a general putrefaction of the fluids through the whole &s;y&s;tem. Thus the
<PB N="33" REF="36">mi&s;chiefs of animal food, putrifying, are greater and more dangerous than &s;uch as ari&s;e from undige&s;ted vegetable food, as this turns &s;our only.</P>
<P>Another difference is this. Vegetable food, during dige&s;tion, &s;timulates le&s;s. When the &s;to|mach is di&s;tended with food, the whole &s;y&s;tem, during dige&s;tion, is more or le&s;s &s;timulated; but more &s;o with animal food than with vegetable. Now, the more our &s;y&s;tem is &s;timulated, the quicker is the circulation and the more feveri&s;h we become.</P>
<P>As animal food fills the blood-ve&s;&s;els fuller with blood than vegetable, it naturally encrea&s;es our mu&s;cular &s;trength; but then it loads the brain, (every part being fuller of blood in proportion) and occa&s;ions heavine&s;s and &s;tupor: whereas vegetable food, from not loading the &s;y&s;tem with blood, rather dimini&s;hes mu&s;cular &s;trength, but enables the mind to act with greater force. Ve|getable food, therefore, is fitter to give clearne&s;s of ideas; and animal food is be&s;t adapted to labour. A phy&s;ical demon&s;tration might be given of this; but to a general reader it would be idle. However, habit has a great effect in this ca&s;e. Man accu&s;tomed to labour, and to eat ve|getable
<PB N="34" REF="37">food, (as are the porters of Con&s;tantino|ple) may be capable of great mu&s;cular exertion; but this does not prove the power of vegetable food over animal. So a hor&s;e fed on gra&s;s, and kept in exerci&s;e, will be better able to work, than one fed on hay and corn for twelve months toge|ther, without exerci&s;e: but this neither is any proof.</P>
<P>The next thing to be con&s;idered is, a maxim generally laid down by all authors on this &s;ubject; namely, that &s;implicity of food is more conducive to health than a variety: but experience teaches us the contrary. Milk, as we before ob&s;erved, which affords great nouri&s;hment, is a mixture of three nutritive &s;ub&s;tances; and we may venture to affirm, that if an alderman was to eat as much of beef-&s;takes, as he does of other things at a city-fea&s;t, he would bring on &s;ickne&s;s and vomit|ing. Put variety of grain before a hen, and &s;he will eat of that &s;he likes be&s;t; but before the day is out, &s;he will eat of the other. In&s;tinct leads her to this, as mo&s;t conducive to her health.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t all food contains oil, and the &s;tomach can better bear a variety of this oil, than a quan|tity of one particular &s;ort. Be&s;ides, animal and
<PB N="35" REF="38">vegetable food correct the ill qualities of one another. Animal food corrects the flatulency of vegetable; and vegetable food, the putre&s;cency of animal. Indeed, a mixture of &s;ome foods will di&s;agree, as fi&s;h and milk; fi&s;h coagulating milk too firmly for ea&s;y dige&s;tion; but there is no rule without an exception.</P>
<P>The mi&s;chief of variety of food is its tempt|ing us to eat too much: but if we avoid eating too much, variety is be&s;t, provided that variety con&s;i&s;ts of things ea&s;y of dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t &s;ingular and curious circum&s;tance, with re&s;pect to food, is this. The powers of di|ge&s;tion are adapted to the want of blood in the blood-ve&s;&s;els. If they are not &s;ufficiently full for the purpo&s;es of health, the appetite is great, dige&s;tion is &s;trong, and much blood is formed; but if they are full enough, there is no appetite, dige&s;tion is weak, and no blood is formed. For, let a man &s;wallow as much food as he can, without an appe|tite, though he is able to dige&s;t it, it will not be converted into blood. So watchful is Nature of her health.</P>
<P>Eating too much food, in general, for a length of time does harm. It weakens the organs of
<PB N="36" REF="39">dige&s;tion, debilitates the con&s;titution, and wears it out. Hence ari&s;e gout, apoplexy, and all the di&s;ea&s;es attendant on old age. In di&s;ea&s;e, men, eating too much, never e&s;cape with impunity.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now proceed to the properties of the different kinds of animal food. There are two &s;ub&s;tances in meat capable of nouri&s;hing; muci|lage and expre&s;&s;ed oil.</P>
<P>Animal mucilages differ much from one ano|ther; but con&s;idered as food, they do not. The only difference of con&s;equence is, as far as de|pends upon their texture. When the fibres of an animal are large, they are not ea&s;ily di&s;&s;olved; of cour&s;e, they are difficult of dige&s;tion. Beef is, on this account, more difficult of dige&s;tion than mutton; the fibres of the one being larger than tho&s;e of the other. On the &s;ame principles, when food is coagulated firmly, it is al&s;o difficult of dige&s;tion. The firmer the coagulum, that is, the le&s;s fluid it contains, the more difficult it will be of dige&s;tion. Animal food, who&s;e fibres have but little fluid between them; that is, dry meat, is more indige&s;tible than moi&s;t. Thus, lean ani|mals are harder of dige&s;tion than fat ones; and the lean part of fat meat is ea&s;ier of dige&s;tion than the lean part of lean meat. By the &s;ame way of
<PB N="37" REF="40">rea&s;oning, meat roa&s;ted or boiled a great deal, is not &s;o dige&s;tible as when roa&s;ted or boiled but little; for when the fluids are expelled by heat, the fibres approach clo&s;er to each other, and, when in the &s;tomach, will not admit the juice of the &s;tomach &s;o readily to penetrate it, con&s;e|quently, fermentation will not take place &s;o &s;oon.</P>
<P>The readier animal food di&s;&s;olves in water, the more dige&s;tible it is. A flounder boiled in an equal quantity of water, is &s;ooner di&s;&s;olved than mutton; therefore flounders are ea&s;ier of dige&s;tion than mutton; the juice of the &s;tomach being little el&s;e than warm water, helped by fermenta|tion. But fi&s;h, though readily &s;oluble in water, has a property in it that renders it indige&s;tible, which is a certain glarinels or vi&s;cidity; but when the &s;tomach is &s;trong enough to dige&s;t it, it is ea&s;ier of dige&s;tion than either fle&s;h or fowl.</P>
<P>Meat apt to putrify, is &s;ooner dige&s;ted, than &s;uch as is not. Pidgeon will putrify &s;ooner than duck: of cour&s;e, pidgeon is ea&s;ier of dige&s;tion than duck. Now, as the fluids in animal food tend to ha&s;ten putrefaction; by depriving it of tho&s;e fluids, by long boiling or roa&s;ting, we ren|der it harder of dige&s;tion. By boiling meat till
<PB N="38" REF="41">it be free from gravy, we can keep it from cor|rupting for &s;ix months. A further proof that meat much dre&s;&s;ed, is le&s;s whole&s;ome than &s;uch as is little dre&s;&s;ed. Such meats, however, as putrify the &s;oone&s;t, are injurious to weak &s;to|machs, as this putre&s;cency &s;timulates during the time of dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>It is with a view of rendering meat ea&s;ier of dige&s;tion, that we keep it &s;ome time after it is killed before we eat it. As &s;oon as meat is killed, it begins to putrify; and putrefaction is the mo&s;t effectual breaker down of animal &s;ub|&s;tance, and a great a&s;&s;i&s;tant to &s;olution, which is the immediate forerunner of dige&s;tion. But the length of time meat ought to be kept, &s;hould be proportioned to its tendency to putrify, and the heat of the weather. It is eaten, for example, much &s;ooner in &s;ummer than in winter.</P>
<P>But the property in which meats differ mo&s;t, is their vi&s;cidity or glarine&s;s. Such as are vi&s;cid, adhere to the &s;ides of the &s;tomach, and &s;timulate much. In quadrupeds, young animals have this property, &s;uch as veal, pig, fawn, and lamb; but in a &s;maller degree. Young birds have the &s;ame bad property, and all fi&s;h, in a great degree; par|ticularly
<PB N="39" REF="42">&s;hell-fi&s;h, which on this account, have often proved poi&s;onous and fatal to many. When the&s;e have proved fatal, it has been a&s;cribed to the copper ve&s;&s;el in which they were dre&s;&s;ed; but a little ob&s;ervation would &s;hew the contrary. When per&s;ons lo&s;e their lives by the ill effects of copper; &s;ickne&s;s, vomiting, and purging take place: but when poi&s;oned by &s;hell-fi&s;h, the head &s;wells, the brea&s;t is oppre&s;&s;ed, and &s;tupor is the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Animal food di&s;&s;olved in water, forms a gela|tinous &s;olution or jelly, which is of a vi&s;cid na|ture, and in &s;ome degree, produces the &s;ame ef|fect as vi&s;cid foods. It &s;timulates, but does not yield much nouri&s;hment. At the &s;ame time, it is difficult of dige&s;tion, and of cour&s;e, improper to be taken by di&s;ea&s;ed or weak &s;tomachs. Jellies, though long pre&s;cribed to &s;trengthen the &s;y&s;tem after a fever, have lately been found prejudicial, and the u&s;e of them are therefore exploded.</P>
<P>E&s;&s;ential oils, inherent in &s;ome animal food, render it difficult of dige&s;tion. The e&s;&s;ential oils of vegetables are often agreeable to the &s;tomach, and &s;timulate it &s;o as to forward dige&s;tion; but tho&s;e of animal food, though agreeable to the ta&s;te, are injurious. Pork, gee&s;e, ducks, &s;almon,
<PB N="40" REF="43">&amp;c. contain much of this oil; and are of cour&s;e, high-flavoured. They may be agreeable to the ta&s;te of &s;trong &s;tomachs; but if eaten in too great quantities, or if the &s;tomach be too weak, they will di&s;agree with it, and have the &s;ame effect with vi&s;cidity; that is, they will &s;timulate the &s;y&s;tem, and &s;ometimes bring on a fever. Animal food then, that is vi&s;cid, that contains much e&s;|&s;ential oil, or will not readily di&s;&s;olve, is apt to re|main too long in the &s;tomach, and do harm. But that which will readily putrify and di&s;&s;olve, is re|tained but a &s;hort time in the &s;tomach; and is, of cour&s;e, ea&s;ily dige&s;ted: for dige&s;tion depending on the contraction of the &s;tomach, if the &s;tomach be &s;o di&s;ordered as to lo&s;e any of its contractile powers, either by the oil or vi&s;cidity of the food, the food will be retained too long in it.</P>
<P>We &s;eldom u&s;e animal food without &s;ome pre|paration. Tho&s;e preparations are either expo&s;ing them to &s;uch heat as will coagulate the &s;olids and fluids, or after &s;uch coagulation, di&s;&s;olving them in water. By coagulating any animal &s;olid, we take off that vi&s;cidity which almo&s;t all have when raw, and the &s;tomach con&s;equently bears it much better. Thus we can dige&s;t twice the quantity of oy&s;ters roa&s;ted, that we can raw.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="44">In coagulating animal &s;ub&s;tances by heat, we often expo&s;e them to great fire, as in roa&s;ting; which coagulates the outer parts, forming a cru&s;t, as it were, round the inward fluids, and retaining them. This gives them an empyreumatic oil, offen&s;ive to the &s;mell. In boiling, we avoid this empyreumatic, but then we take out the e&s;&s;ential oil. In frying, we retain both oils, &s;o that fried meat is more difficult of dige&s;tion than either roa&s;ted or boiled.</P>
<P>Chicken, partridges, veal, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are more whole|&s;ome when roa&s;ted, than boiled. Mutton, beef, pork, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are ea&s;ier dige&s;ted when boiled.</P>
<P>All quadrupeds that feed on vegetables are u&s;ed, &s;omewhere or other, for food; &s;uch as the ox, the &s;heep, the deer, the goat, the hog, the hare, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In &s;ome countries, hor&s;es are eaten; in others, &s;quirrels, rats, and mice. Animals that live on animal food alone, are &s;eldom eaten; as the lion, the cat, the tyger, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Few make u&s;e of dogs, or any animals of that cla&s;s; tho&s;e who do, feed them on vegetables. Such animals as live on animal food alone, being, on account of their putre&s;cency, and of the great quantity of e&s;&s;ential oil contained in them, both di&s;agreeable o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;tomach, and difficult of dige&s;tion.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="45">Birds al&s;o are made u&s;e of for food, except birds of prey; that is, &s;uch as live on other birds; and we except them for the &s;ame rea&s;ons that we do bea&s;ts of prey. We prefer &s;uch as live on in&s;ects to &s;uch as feed on fi&s;h, becau&s;e they are tenderer; &s;uch as live on fi&s;h acquiring a tough|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>All fi&s;h have been eaten, and all &s;hell-fi&s;h which have &s;ufficient mu&s;cular fle&s;h to render them worth eating.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e birds that are not very putre&s;cent in their nature, and are mo&s;t free from e&s;&s;ential oil, are the ea&s;ie&s;t of dige&s;tion. As for example, moor-game, poultry, partridges, phea&s;ants, <HI>&amp;c;</HI> and of quadrupeds, the deer, the &s;heep, the ox, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The older animals of this cla&s;s are ea&s;ier of dige&s;tion than the young ones. Mutton, for in|&s;tance, is ea&s;ier of dige&s;tion than lamb; beef than veal; veni&s;on than fawn; and that on ac|count of the vi&s;cidity of the fle&s;h of young ani|mals. Fi&s;h is more difficult of dige&s;tion than fle&s;h, e&s;pecially in weak &s;tomachs. And of fi&s;h, tho&s;e that have lea&s;t flavour, that is, &s;uch as have lea&s;t e&s;&s;ential oil in them, are white, and have &s;ome degree of firmne&s;s, will dige&s;t much &s;ooner than
<PB N="43" REF="46">&s;uch as are of &s;tronger flavour. Flounders, whitings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are ea&s;ier of dige&s;tion than &s;almon, foals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;till, quadrupeds afford more nouri&s;hment than either birds or fi&s;h; and tho&s;e animals of &s;tronger flavour, <HI>viz.</HI> pork, gee&s;e, duck, &s;almon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> afford more nouri&s;hment and are fitter for &s;uch as labour or take a great deal of exerci&s;e, than animals of the &s;ame cla&s;s, that are ea&s;ier of dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>Now, to correct the ill qualities of the different kind of food, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t dige&s;tion, we make u&s;e of a variety of things, &s;uch as are called the decoraments of the table; which in them&s;elves af|ford little or no nouri&s;hment. The&s;e are &s;pices, acids, &s;alt, oil, and &s;ugar.</P>
<P>Spices act as &s;timulants. It mu&s;t here be re|collected, that dige&s;tion depends upon the con|tracting power of the &s;tomach, it being that which prevents the food turning acid or putrid. Now, if the action of the &s;tomach be weak, that is, not &s;ufficiently powerful, food will not be pro|perly dige&s;ted.</P>
<P>Spices then are powerful &s;timulants, that is, they encrea&s;e the action of the &s;tomach, and are
<PB N="44" REF="47">agreeable to it; &s;uch as the aromatic &s;pices, <HI>viz.</HI> cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, mace, pimento, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are the produce of the warmer climates; but they are, at the &s;ame time, inflammatory, tending to encrea&s;e the circulation of the blood, and bring on fever. We u&s;e mu&s;tard, onions, hor&s;e-raddi&s;h, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. The&s;e &s;timulate univer&s;ally, but are not inflammatory; becau&s;e their powers do not continue long; where|as &s;pices &s;timulate for a con&s;iderable length of time. Mint, thyme, &s;age, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> par&s;ley, fennel, cele|ry, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are &s;timulants, but not &s;o powerful as mu&s;tard, onions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> nor are they inflammatory.</P>
<P>Spices &s;eem adapted to different climates, and different &s;tomachs. In warm climates, and weak &s;tomachs, &s;pices are more whole&s;ome than in colder climates, and &s;tronger &s;tomachs. In warm climates, the heat of the atmo&s;phere upon the &s;kin keeps up con&s;tant great circulation there. The internal blood-ve&s;&s;els are, of cour&s;e, empty, and the interior parts con&s;equently weaker, <HI>viz.</HI> the &s;tomach, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It requires therefore more pow|erful &s;timulants to a&s;&s;i&s;t dige&s;tion, and the natural weakne&s;s of the &s;tomach prevents their inflamma|tory power. Hence, we may ob&s;erve, that &s;pices are more whole&s;ome in &s;ummer than in winter; and that per&s;ons of luxurious life, who live with|out exerci&s;e, who&s;e &s;tomachs are, of cour&s;e, weak|ened
<PB N="45" REF="48">and impaired, may eat them with greater &s;afety than &s;uch as are &s;trong, laborious, and healthful.</P>
<P>In colder climates, and with temperate livers, the &s;tomach is naturally &s;trong: very little &s;timu|lants, therefore, are required. Inflammatory ones mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, do mi&s;chief. If any, then, are u&s;ed, it &s;hould be tho&s;e of the &s;econd cla&s;s, <HI>viz.</HI> mu&s;tard, onions, hor&s;e-raddi&s;h, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Nature &s;eems here to have provided for her&s;elf; for we find &s;pices only in warm countries: none grow natu|rally in cold ones. But the &s;econd cla&s;s are prin|cipally natives of cold climates. If any of the &s;pices are made to grow in a cold climate, part of their &s;timulus is lo&s;t; and if the &s;econd cla&s;s of &s;timulants are made to grow in a warm climate, it is the &s;ame. Pepper grown here lo&s;es its &s;timulating powers; and an onion grown in Spain, is not &s;o &s;trong as one, the produce of England. They &s;eem de&s;tined then for particular climates. In hot countries, therefore, &s;pices are nece&s;&s;ary; but in colder ones, they are prejudicial. If the &s;tomach then be weak, which, in time, will di&s;or|der the &s;y&s;tem, it may be proper, to u&s;e &s;pices, but, if not weak, on no account to u&s;e them; for they have &s;ometimes done &s;o much harm, as to|tally to de&s;troy dige&s;tion, unle&s;s great quantities have been con&s;tantly thrown in with the food.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="49">A little &s;pice, u&s;ed with the more flatulent vege|tables, is frequently &s;erviceable, as by encrea&s;ing the action of the &s;tomach, it brings on dige&s;tion, before that fermentation takes place, which in weak &s;tomachs, would be attended with extrica|tion of air. Thus, we u&s;e pepper with greens, peas, &amp;c. to correct what is called their windi|ne&s;s; and we u&s;e pepper with broth, to coagulate the fluid more firmly, and correct its putre|&s;cency, both which are brought about by the action of the &s;tomach. Lemon-juice, barley, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is often added to both, for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. So we eat mu&s;tard with &s;alted pork and beef, &s;alted fi&s;h, &amp;c. in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t dige&s;tion, by encrea&s;ing the action of the &s;tomach; &s;alted provi&s;ions being being more difficult of dige&s;tion than &s;uch as are fre&s;h.</P>
<P>The &s;econd cla&s;s of &s;ub&s;tances to a&s;&s;i&s;t dige&s;tion are acids. None but the native vegetable acid, <HI>viz.</HI> the juice of four fruits, is capable of afford|ing nouri&s;hment; nor would this, if pure; it is owing to the mucilage mixed with it, that it nouri&s;hes. Acids then <HI>offi&s;t</HI> dige&s;tion merely.</P>
<P>Acids produce many effects. In the fir&s;t place, they &s;timulate the glands of the &s;tomach, creating by their &s;timulus that &s;en&s;ation we call
<PB N="47" REF="50">hunger. Dige&s;tion being con&s;iderably affected by the appetite; if there is no appetite, though the &s;tomach be &s;trong, there will be no dige&s;tion We frequently then employ acids, a little before meals, to create an appetite. Thus, in hot countries, where owing to an encrea&s;ed circulation of the &s;kin, the internal circulation is dimini&s;hed, and, of cour&s;e, the &s;tomach weakened, the in|habitants accu&s;tom them&s;elves to the drinking of beverage or lemonade before dinner, to encrea&s;e their appetite.</P>
<P>Acids al&s;o promote &s;ecretion of the glands of the &s;tomach, &s;o as to &s;upply the food with a watery men&s;truum; that is, fluid proper and &s;ufficient to promote fermentation.</P>
<P>They act al&s;o as &s;edatives or quieters of the re&s;t of the &s;y&s;tem, taking off that &s;timulus occa|&s;ioned by dige&s;tion. Hence they are beneficial in warm climates, and in weather where the heat naturally &s;timulates the &s;y&s;tem; and that &s;timulus is liable to be encrea&s;ed by dige&s;tion. Hence, as was &s;aid before, fruit is exceeding whole&s;ome in the &s;ummer, and at certain times, if taken in moderate quantities.</P>
<P>Acids tend likewi&s;e to coagulate animal &s;olids,
<PB N="48" REF="51">and fluids; and, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the coagulating fluids of the &s;tomach, they take off the vi&s;cidity of food. Thus we u&s;e lemon or vinegar with fi&s;h, particu|larly &s;hell-fi&s;h. Indeed, &s;hell-fi&s;h &s;hould never be eaten without &s;ome acid; they being, as was be|fore ob&s;erved, in their nature &s;o remarkably vi&s;cid, and, of cour&s;e, &s;o prejudicial to the con&s;titution. It is for the &s;ame rea&s;on, that we u&s;e acids with veal, lamb, and all young animals; namely, to correct their vi&s;cidity. Of all acids, vinegar, provided we attend to its quality, is the &s;afe&s;t.</P>
<P>Acids check al&s;o vinous and acetous fermenta|tion; that is, &s;uch fermentation as &s;hould by no means take place in the &s;tomach. It is for this rea&s;on we u&s;e them with &s;ub&s;tances of loo&s;e tex|ture, that are apt to turn &s;our in the &s;tomach, and become flatulent or windy. Thus we eat vinegar with &s;allad, and greens of all &s;orts. So, in all weak &s;tomachs, where food is apt to turn &s;our, and cau&s;e heart-burn, the u&s;e of acids has been found to correct and take it off. It is on this account, that fruit has been introduced after meals. Acids then are u&s;eful for many purpo&s;es in dige&s;tion; but taken in too great quantities, they are hurt|ful, as they will produce a di&s;po&s;ition to flatu|lency, pain, and weakne&s;s, in the &s;tomach and
<PB N="49" REF="52">bowels, which is afterwards cured with dif|ficulty.</P>
<P>The next &s;ub&s;tance, in general u&s;e with food, is &s;alt, which affords no kind of nouri&s;hment; neither will it dige&s;t, but pa&s;&s;es through the body without any change. It is, however, univer&s;ally u&s;ed where it can be got; nay, all animals prefer food that is &s;alti&s;h to &s;uch as is not. This gene|ral in&s;tinct, we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, would not be given, but to &s;ome purpo&s;e; yet it is difficult to &s;ay of what u&s;e &s;alt is, in dige&s;tion. It &s;timulates the glands of the &s;tomach, and promotes &s;ecretion of the watery men&s;truum; but of what other u&s;e it is, we know not.</P>
<P>We often pre&s;erve food with &s;alt; and thus pre&s;erved, it is con&s;iderably more difficult of di|ge&s;tion. The fibres are hardened, they are not &s;o readily di&s;&s;olved, and they go through the proper fermentation of the &s;tomach with difficulty. Thus it is, that we cannot live &s;o long on &s;alted provi&s;ion as on fre&s;h; for, as was before ob&s;erved, the &s;alt does not penetrate thoroughly into all parts of the meat; therefore, when in the &s;to|mach, before fermentation takes place in the outer parts, the inner will putrify, and, by infecting the fluids of the body, bring on the &s;curvy, as we &s;ee
<PB N="50" REF="53">it does, in per&s;ons upon a long voyage. And yet &s;alt may be u&s;ed, in the greate&s;t quantity, &s;o as to prevent putrefaction of food, without rendering it totally unfit for nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>Oil is another &s;ub&s;tance that may be u&s;ed to help dige&s;tion, it taking off the vi&s;cidity of food. Hence it is, that we eat &s;alad, with which oil has been mixed, with the meat of young animals, as with veal, lamb, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and (with &s;ome kinds of fi&s;h) which, from its glarine&s;s, tends much to di&s;turb dige&s;tion. Oil al&s;o takes off the di&s;po&s;ition in loo&s;e vegetables to ferment improperly, and thus prevents flatulency. It is for this rea&s;on, we u&s;e it with &s;allads, greens, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But oil, in weak &s;tomachs di&s;po&s;ed to acidity, is apt to produce &s;ourne&s;s in the &s;tomach, and bring on heart-burn, &s;ickne&s;s, vomiting, and purging. Why it &s;hould have the&s;e contrary effects, we cannot &s;ay; but ex|perience &s;hews it to be true.</P>
<P>Sugar is another a&s;&s;i&s;tant of dige&s;tion, by pre|venting the bad effects of &s;ome food, and affords con&s;iderable nouri&s;hment in it&s;elf. A diluted &s;o|lution ferments more readily than a more cen|trated one; that is, the more water you put to &s;ugar, provided you exceed not certain bounds, the more readily it ferments. Sugar mixed with
<PB N="51" REF="54">a certain quantity of water, pre&s;ently becomes vi|negar. Now, the loo&s;er vegetables and fruits, &s;uch as &s;alad, currants, cherries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> contain in them a more diluted &s;olution of &s;ugar than the firmer vegetables, or the &s;weeter fruits. It is on this account, that we frequently eat &s;ugar with them. Another rea&s;on why we eat &s;ugar with &s;uch vegetables, is to take off the ace&s;ency and fla|tulency which they are apt to run &s;oon into, by rendering them more difficult to ferment. Sugar al&s;o corrects the putre&s;cency of animal food; but not &s;o much as vegetables do. For this purpo&s;e, it was much u&s;ed in England before kitchen|gardens became general.</P>
<P>It is not above 150 years &s;ince greens, and other vegetables were imported from Holland, (a kitchen-garden being then a great curio&s;ity.) Salted meat at that time, was much eaten; and the &s;ea-&s;curvy very general. Per&s;ons were then accu&s;tomed to eat &s;ugared mutton and &s;u|gared ham. At pre&s;ent, the cu&s;tom is not &s;o much aboli&s;hed, but that we eat &s;weet &s;auces with various kinds of food.</P>
<P>Sugar has been &s;aid to &s;poil the teeth. This ob&s;ervation may, in &s;ome ca&s;es, be ju&s;t; as, where the teeth may have a more than ordinary degree
<PB N="52" REF="55">of &s;en&s;ibility; or it may, perhaps, by &s;ticking about them, and turning acid, corrode them: but faults of this kind are oftener imputed to it than it de&s;erves. The finer the &s;ugar, the purer and le&s;s noxious it is. Pre&s;erves are far from unwhole|&s;ome,&mdash;and pickles may be con&s;idered as &s;punges filled with vinegar.</P>
<P>Having thus entered into the &s;everal properties of eatables, let us now proceed to drinks.</P>
<P>Water is nece&s;&s;ary to dige&s;tion and nouri&s;h|ment. For there are &s;alts con&s;tantly forming in the blood, be&s;ides &s;uch as are thrown into it by the &s;tomach: whoever has accidentally ta&s;ted their own blood, will be convinced of this, by its &s;aline ta&s;te. There is always al&s;o, a &s;mall part of the blood, in &s;ome degree, putrifying. Now, if the&s;e &s;alts and this putre&s;cency were accumu|lated to any great degree, it would prove fatal. Water, then, is nece&s;&s;ary to wa&s;h away the&s;e &s;alts, and this putre&s;cency. Be&s;ides, the &s;aliva and natural juice of the &s;tomach, is not &s;ufficient of them&s;elves to di&s;&s;olve the aliment, and carry on fermentation. Water then is a great a&s;&s;i&s;tant. But pure water is not &s;o proper for either of the&s;e purpo&s;es; for water will run off too &s;oon; that is, it will not remain mixed with the food long
<PB N="53" REF="56">enough to go through fermentation with it; nei|ther will it alone carry off the putre&s;cent or &s;aline &s;ub&s;tance in the blood. Mixing mucilaginous matter with it, as in wine, beer, cyder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> enables it to an&s;wer the&s;e purpo&s;es. Thus, we &s;ee the &s;aliva or &s;pittle which Nature provides, is a vi&s;cid fluid, or a mucilaginous one.</P>
<P>Wine, being in a &s;tate of fermentation it&s;elf, tends to forward fermentation in the &s;tomach. For any &s;ub&s;tance going through one fermenta|tion, generally forwards fermentation in another. Accordingly we find per&s;ons accu&s;tomed to drink weak wine, cannot dige&s;t their food with water alone, but will have eruptions on the &s;kin during the time that their meat is in their &s;tomach. Be&s;ides, wine is as nece&s;&s;ary to a weak &s;tomach, as &s;pices; for if it be not too &s;trong, nor taken in too great quantities, it &s;timulates the &s;tomach, makes it contract freer, and thus forwards dige&s;|tion. In warm climates, the inhabitants could not pre|&s;erve their health without it; the heat of the wea|ther keeping up &s;uch a circulation of the blood on the &s;urface of the body, as to weaken the internal parts, and render dige&s;tion difficult. Accordingly we find, that Nature has provided them amply with the means of procuring wine. Hence it
<PB N="54" REF="57">follows, that a gla&s;s of wine, occa&s;ionally taken in &s;ummer, is more beneficial than one drank in winter; as the one helps dige&s;tion, while the other tends to de&s;troy it.</P>
<P>Was man to live the life of a &s;avage, water would be a &s;ufficient drink; as eating only a &s;mall quantity, and u&s;ing great exerci&s;e, his dige&s;tive organs would be much &s;tronger, and &s;ufficient for dige&s;tion without any other a&s;&s;i&s;tance: but accor|ding to his pre&s;ent method of living, eating daily too much, and taking little exerci&s;e, he requires wine. However, the wine &s;hould be diluted with water; for was it to intoxicate to any degree, it would overthrow the de&s;ign for which it was taken, prevent the &s;tomach from eating &s;uffici|ently, and interrupt dige&s;tion going on. By wine here, we mean all vinous liquors, as wine, cyder, ale, &s;mall beer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>If we drink pure water, it will find its way out of the body by urine or &s;weat, without carrying any of the &s;aline, or putre&s;cent parts of the blood with it; but if we u&s;e mucilaginous fluids, as wine, beer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they remain &s;ome time in the blood, mix with the &s;aline and putre&s;cent &s;ub&s;tances of it, and gradually carry them off. Water then, is
<PB N="55" REF="58">the nece&s;&s;ary drink, but it is much helped by brewing; that is, wine, beer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> if moderately taken, as we have mentioned, is the be&s;t liquor we can u&s;e.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid &s;o much upon the nature of di|ge&s;tion, and the property of food in general, let us run over them again a little more particularly; and fir&s;t, let us &s;peak of fruits.</P>
<P>Stone-fruits, in general, are of a &s;oft lax tex|ture, and their juices dilute; by which means, they are ea&s;ily di&s;&s;olved in the &s;tomach. It is for this rea&s;on, they are apt to be eaten in large quan|tities. Hence, as they are more liable to fermen|tation than any other, and produce a copious acid, they are apt to irritate the inte&s;tines, and bring on purging and vomiting. Apricots and peaches are le&s;s noxious than either the cherry or the plumb, being &s;weeter and richer: the later fruit is, in general, the riche&s;t.</P>
<P>Apples and pears being of a firmer texture, and containing a le&s;s active acid, are not &s;o liable to a noxious fermentation as the &s;tone-fruits, and will continue longer in the &s;tomach; and of the&s;e, pears are more whole&s;ome than apples; for the pear being &s;pecifically heavier than water, will
<PB N="56" REF="59">&s;ink to the bottom of the &s;tomach, and be &s;ooner dige&s;ted; while apples, &s;wimming near the top, will elude the action of the inte&s;tines, and by irritating the left orifice of the &s;tomach, will often produce unea&s;y &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>Strawberries and ra&s;berries are of a very tender texture; therefore ea&s;ily di&s;&s;olved, pa&s;&s;ing off before a very active fermentation can take place, which is likewi&s;e prevented by their &s;weetne&s;s. On all the&s;e accounts, they are very innocent.</P>
<P>Currants are an acid fruit; have very little &s;weetne&s;s; of cour&s;e, very little nouri&s;hment, and are liable to all the bad qualities of &s;tone-fruits.</P>
<P>Goo&s;berries are much &s;weeter, more nouri&s;h|ing, and more innocent; and without the hu&s;ks, are very ea&s;ily dige&s;ted; and on account of their &s;weetne&s;s, le&s;s &s;ubject to active fermentation.</P>
<P>Grapes are a richer fruit, containing a great quantity of &s;ugar, on which account they are more nutritive than any we have mentioned; and if eaten when perfectly ripe, and in modera|tion, are innocent.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="60">When we apply heat to the&s;e fruits; that is, when we bake or boil them, we change their qualities, di&s;&s;ipate their active acid, and di&s;po&s;e them le&s;s to ferment. Hence, univer&s;ally, baked or boiled fruits are &s;afer than fre&s;h. It is to de|&s;troy their di&s;po&s;ition to fermentation, that we frequently eat them with milk or cream, who&s;e oily nature produces that effect. Wine is al&s;o u&s;ed to obviate the bad effects of fruit; but this depends upon its &s;pirituous part, and therefore pure &s;pirit, were it not otherwi&s;e noxious, would be mo&s;t eligible. If wine be u&s;ed, it &s;hould be &s;trong and mellow. Another method of u&s;ing them, is with &s;ugar. This &s;urely renders fruit more nutritive; and to &s;our fruits, mu&s;t be a ju|dicious addition. Sometimes we u&s;e oily matters; as butter in apple-pye. This, from its antifer|mentative quality, is a proper addition; but in weak &s;tomachs, is apt to produce heart-burn, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is &s;afer to eat the mild fruit, before meals; the the &s;our fruits, after.</P>
<P>We come next to the herbs. Beet and &s;pin|nage are watery and in&s;ipid; they contain but little &s;ugar or mucilaginous matter; and, of cour&s;e, afford but little nouri&s;hment. On account of their little acidity and loo&s;e texture, they are le&s;s flatulent than &s;ome of the other herbs.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="61">Dandelion, endive, lettuce, are all of them milky plants; and it is almo&s;t a univer&s;al rule, that tho&s;e which afford a milky juice, are remarkably acrid, and many of them poi&s;onous; but the&s;e I have mentioned have been excepted; however, they are all opiates, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, when old; for this rea&s;on, we only u&s;e them when very young, and we blanch them, to free them of their acri|mony, which is done by tying them up, and thus depriving them of light. They are flatulent; and, as &s;uch, &s;hould be never eaten without pepper, or &s;omething to an&s;wer the &s;ame pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>Cellery contains a poi&s;onous acrimony; on which account, it is blanched for u&s;e, though it is never wholly deprived of its acrimony in this way; boiling does it more effectually, and gives it a mucilaginous &s;weetne&s;s; con&s;equently, it is mo&s;t whole&s;ome in broths, and that in the &s;um|mer, when the &s;tomach can bear &s;timulating mo&s;t.</P>
<P>A&s;paragus is only whole&s;ome when in an inter|mediate &s;tate, between root and plant; when old, it is remarkably acrid; but when young, it is &s;weet and mucilaginous.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="62">Artichokes, if young and boiled, are of a tender texture, ea&s;ily dige&s;ted, and not flatulent. They are &s;weet, and, of cour&s;e, remarkably nu|tritious.</P>
<P>Mu&s;hrooms are very nutritive, and much a kin to animal food; that is, they re&s;emble meat in their properties; and as &s;uch, may be eaten by &s;trong per&s;ons in con&s;iderable quantity. The morelle and tru&s;le are of this kind; but on ac|count of their &s;timulating powers, are more u&s;ed as a fa&s;hionable ornament to our di&s;hes, than as any proper food.</P>
<P>The next to be con&s;idered, are our e&s;culent roots. The raddi&s;h, as being &s;o acrid, is u&s;ed only as &s;allad, or after meals to help dige&s;tion. It is mo&s;t whole&s;ome when &s;craped. The turnep is, at be&s;t, when deprived of its acrid &s;kin, but a watery weak nutriment, very flatulent, or windy; and, if eaten in great quantities, will purge.</P>
<P>The carrot and par&s;nip, from the &s;weet muci|laginous matter contained in them, are very nou|ri&s;hing; but the carrot more than the par&s;nip, as containing the greate&s;t quantity of the two.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="63">The leek, the onion, and the garlic, are in their recent &s;tate, acrid, but innocent. When by age or climate, this acrimony is too great, we do not u&s;e them as food. When boiled, this acri|mony is de&s;troyed, and a remarkable mild &s;ub|&s;tance remains, very nutritious, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e who can dige&s;t them raw.</P>
<P>But of all the culinary herbs, potatoes are the be&s;t; they, containing a kind of flour, are, on that account, very nouri&s;hing, and le&s;s flatulent than any, con&s;equently very whole&s;ome. The more mealy they are, the better.</P>
<P>The next in order are peas, beans, French beans, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they contain a degree of oil and &s;ugar mixed, con&s;equently afford pure and &s;trong nouri&s;hment, as appear from experiments made on dome&s;tic animals, <HI>viz.</HI> hogs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But as they are of firm texture, and not ea&s;ily dige&s;ted, their u&s;e in food &s;hould be confined to the hardy and robu&s;t. They are more flatulent than mo&s;t vegetables, therefore improper aliment for weak &s;tomachs. When eaten young, before they come to be ripe, they are indeed le&s;s flatulent, on account of their not having attained the oil they afterwards gain; but then their nutriment is proportionably dimini&s;h|ed. French beans being eaten in their cod, are
<PB N="61" REF="64">not &s;o flatulent as the other two; and peas, either ripe or not, being of a more tender and &s;oluble texture than beans, are not &s;o often eaten. The pea is u&s;ed for culinary purpo&s;es, as puddings, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>So much for vegetable food: let us now con|&s;ider the particular &s;orts of animal. And fir&s;t, with re&s;pect to beef and veal. Were we purely to con&s;ider tenderne&s;s of texture, the younge&s;t ani|mals certainly would be always preferred; but when we talk of them as nouri&s;hing food, beef is, for the rea&s;ons I have mentioned, more nutritive than veal: for when an animal is very young, we commonly have an aver&s;ion to it. The whole of it then is, as it were, a &s;emifluid ma&s;s, which we cannot take, in &s;ufficient quantity; and which, from its watery con&s;i&s;tence, mu&s;t be but little nutritious. It is the &s;ame with re&s;pect to mutton and lamb, veni&s;on and fawn, pork and pig, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Mutton has commonly been preferred to all the fle&s;hes of quadrupeds; and indeed, be|&s;ides its being more perfect, has the advantage over them of being more generally &s;uited to dif|ferent climates. Beef requires a very nice inter|mediate &s;tate, rich pa&s;tures and temperate air; which it &s;eems to enjoy chiefly in this country: whereas &s;heep can be brought to almo&s;t the &s;ame
<PB N="62" REF="65">perfection in the bleak northern, as in the&s;e mild &s;outhern countries.</P>
<P>Hare, being an animal much exerci&s;ed, acquires a firmne&s;s of fibres, and is difficult of dige&s;tion; and when killed, after a long chace, when much of the oil of the body is ab&s;orbed, its mu&s;cular parts are much firmer and tougher than when killed in the &s;eat. The rabbit, being of very little exerci&s;e, is one of the white meats, without vi&s;cidity, and is one of the lighte&s;t and mo&s;t di|ge&s;tible foods in u&s;e.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the hog; it, being the only dome&s;tic animal we know, of no u&s;e to men when alive; is therefore properly de&s;igned for food. Be&s;ides, as loath&s;ome and ugly to every human eye, it is killed without reluctance. Pork is of very tender &s;tructure, encrea&s;ed, perhaps, from a peculiarity in its nature, <HI>viz.</HI> taking in fat more readily than any other animal. Pork is a white meat, even in its adult &s;tate, and then gives out a jelly in very great quantity; and on account of its tenderne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is very nutritious.</P>
<P>The next cla&s;s of animal food, is that of birds; of which there are &s;everal kinds. The cock, hen, chicken, and capon, are entirely do|me&s;tic,
<PB N="63" REF="66">there being no country in which they are found wild. They take little exerci&s;e, and live mo&s;tly on vegetables; hence they are food of a tender &s;tructure, ea&s;y of dige&s;tion, and, as a white meat, gelatinous. When very young, they are extremely vi&s;cid; when old, tough and liga|mentous: &s;o that the proper time of u&s;ing them is in a middle &s;tate, between the&s;e two extremes; that is, when about a year old. Such as eat them younger, eat them when unwhole&s;ome. Now, a barn-door fowl is far preferable to one that is crammed; as exerci&s;e is nece&s;&s;ary to give perfec|tion; for by this means, the fat of the animal is equally di&s;per&s;ed through the mu&s;cular parts; whereas, when the bird is fatted ha&s;tily, the fat is accumulated in particular parts.</P>
<P>Turkies are of the &s;ame kind with the cock, hen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> equally tender, and equally ea&s;y of di|ge&s;tion. With re&s;pect to wild fowl; &s;uch as the phea&s;ant, the grou&s;e, the partridge, and the quail, they approach in their nature to the tame fowl; but are of a higher flavour, are more tender, and rather ea&s;ier of dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>We come next to water-fowl. Of the&s;e the duck, both wild and tame, contains a great deal
<PB N="64" REF="67">of e&s;&s;ential oil, and will not &s;o readily dige&s;t in the &s;tomach. However, the wild duck, from its being much exerci&s;ed, being generally carnivorous, is more &s;oluble than the tame duck, and, of cour&s;e, ea&s;ier dige&s;ted. The tame goo&s;e is mani|fe&s;tly le&s;s vi&s;cid than the duck, but is of a firmer texture. Dige&s;tion, with regard to this bird, is not &s;o con&s;tant; it depending on the di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;tomach. But the teal, though much of the nature of the wild duck, is the mo&s;t tender and &s;avoury, the lea&s;t vi&s;cid, and the mo&s;t whole&s;ome of this kind.</P>
<P>The next cla&s;s of aquatics, are the woodcock, &s;nipe, the grey and green plover, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of which the woodcock and &s;nipe, although they live chiefly on infects, are of a tender &s;tructure, approaching to the white meats of the cock and hen.</P>
<P>I have given the reader to under&s;tand, that exer|ci&s;e produces firmne&s;s. An opportunity now of|fers to illu&s;trate it. The woodcock is obliged to fly much about, while the partridge walks more and flies le&s;s. Hence, it is ob&s;erved, that the wing of the woodcock is always very tough, while that of the partridge is very tender; and, on the contrary, the leg of the woodcock is very
<PB N="65" REF="68">tender, while that of the partridge is very tough. Hence the old doggrel di&s;tich:
<Q><L>If the partridge had but the woodcock's thigh,</L>
<L>He'd be the be&s;t bird that e'er doth fly.</L></Q></P>
<P>With re&s;pect to pidgeons, another cla&s;s of birds, they are, in their nature, hot and alkale&s;cent, that is, very much di&s;po&s;ed to active fermentation in the &s;tomach; and perhaps, more &s;o than any other, bird of this kind that lives on grain. We attribute this to much exerci&s;e. When young, they are tender and ea&s;ily dige&s;ted. As to &s;maller birds, <HI>viz.</HI> the lark, the thru&s;h, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> there is probably a difference according to their exerci&s;e and food; but it will be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that, when taken at a proper age, they are tender, juicy, and whole|&s;ome.</P>
<P>We have a good opportunity here to mention eggs. It is obvious, from their nature and u&s;e, in the nouri&s;hment of the foetus, that they contain a lar|ger proportion of pure nutriment than any other food. Notwith&s;tanding this, eggs are not of ea&s;y dige&s;tion; and from the proportion of nouri&s;h|ment
<PB N="66" REF="69">they afford, cannot be eaten in any large quantity.</P>
<P>We will now proceed to fi&s;h: but fir&s;t, let us mention the turtle, an amphibious animal, now become a great delicacy. From &s;ome particu|lars in its oeconomy, from its little motion, and its living on vegetables, it is of a very gelatinous nature, and highly nutritious.</P>
<P>The texture of fi&s;h, in general, is more tender than that of fle&s;h. They have nothing of a fibrous &s;tructure like fle&s;h; of cour&s;e, they are ea&s;ier dige&s;ted than meat, e&s;pecially &s;uch as are not of a vi&s;cid nature. We have had occa&s;ion to &s;ay &s;omething on the different kinds of fi&s;h before, as indeed, we have on mo&s;t &s;orts of food; but as it is a matter in which mankind are highly concern|ed, it may not be unnece&s;&s;ary to be a little more particular.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of the &s;almon kind, as the &s;ea-&s;almon, the river-trout, the &s;melt, the charr, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are of a tender &s;ub&s;tance, &s;ufficiently juicy and nouri&s;h|ing; but, like other fi&s;h, they are heating, and apt to breed humours in the &s;kin. The &s;almon|trout is undoubtedly more &s;timulating, and le&s;s gelatinous than tho&s;e of the white kind.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="70">The next cla&s;s, &s;uch as the barbel, the carp, the gudgeon, the tench, the chubb, the roach, the bleak, and the bream, is drier, and le&s;s tendi|nous; le&s;s &s;trong and heating; and of a nature le&s;s gelatinous. The perch is &s;omething of this kind, of a firm texture, but tender &s;ub&s;tance, ea&s;ily dige&s;ted, neither glutinous, heating, or re|markably &s;timulant.</P>
<P>The next cla&s;s is &s;ea-fi&s;h, and that of the whit|ing, the haddock, and the cod. The&s;e give a gra|dation in tenderne&s;s, glutino&s;ity, and &s;timulus to the whole &s;y&s;tem; the cod being the firme&s;t, mo&s;t vi&s;cid, and mo&s;t heating, of the three.</P>
<P>The lump is a remarkable vi&s;cid fi&s;h, ap|proaching in quality to the eel, and exceedingly nutritious to tho&s;e who u&s;e it. The mackerel is of drier &s;ub&s;tance, and le&s;s nutritious. The mullet is between the carp and the haddock; le&s;s dry than the one, and more juicy than the other. The pike, though rapacious and carnivorous, is dry and in &s;ome degree, oily, and one of the lea&s;t heat|ing of any we take in.</P>
<P>Another cla&s;s, is that of the herring, the &s;prat, the anchovy, and the &s;had; which are of an oily,
<PB N="68" REF="71">juicy, nutritious nature, in their heating quality next to the &s;almon, &s;timulating the &s;y&s;tem and quickening the pul&s;e to a con&s;iderable degree.</P>
<P>The next cla&s;s is that of the flounder kind, <HI>viz.</HI> the common flounder, the &s;oal, the plai&s;e, the turbot, and the holibut. The&s;e are all of a ten|der oily, juicy nature, more vi&s;cid than the pre|ceding cla&s;s; but le&s;s &s;o than the following. They are &s;et down according to their qualities; the flounder and &s;oal more tender, the turbot and holibut more vi&s;cid.</P>
<P>The la&s;t is the eel kind, as the &s;and-eel, the com|mon eel, the conger-eel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e are of the &s;ame quality with the viper, vi&s;cid, nutritious, and difficultly per&s;pirable; by long retention in the &s;tomach, heating, and oppre&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the crab, the &s;hrimp, and the lob&s;ter, they come under the name of in&s;ects: they are of a nature, that if boiled, will give a jellied broth, and are apt to &s;timulate the &s;y&s;tem very much, producing heat, anxiety, and fever. As to oy&s;ters, they are nutritious, and though long retained in the &s;tomach, as little heating to the &s;y&s;tem as any. The mu&s;cle, they &s;ay, is poi|&s;onous; but where the poi&s;on re&s;ides, we cannot
<PB N="69" REF="72">tell: the ill effects &s;ometimes on eating them, mu&s;t proceed from their vi&s;cidity.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, we beg, it may be under&s;tood, that what has been &s;aid re&s;pecting foods, holds good only in general. Difference of con&s;titution will produce different effects. Thus, according to the old adage,
<Q>What is one man's meat, may be another man's poi&s;on.</Q> If per&s;ons are &s;o ra&s;h as to determine the quality of any particular food to be good, becau&s;e it agrees with them, it is in vain &s;aying any thing to them, upon the &s;ubject: what is whole&s;ome to-day, may be be injurious to morrow; and though at pre&s;ent, they find no ill effects from the u&s;e of certain things, they may lay the foundation of di&s;ea&s;es, and unhappily experience them later in life.</P>
<P>But before we di&s;mi&s;s this &s;ubject, we mu&s;t take notice of the u&s;e of coffee and tea. Much di&s;pute has ari&s;en about their virtues. One would ima|gine, frequent experience would long ago have &s;ilenced &s;uch di&s;putes. Their effects are, un|doubtedly, very much mixed, depending on the warm water. The virtues attributed to them, &s;uch as a&s;&s;i&s;ting dige&s;tion, relieving the &s;tomach from a load of food, from crudities and from
<PB N="70" REF="73">head-achs ari&s;ing from them, promoting the &s;ecre|tion of urine, and perhaps of per&s;piration, may be all fairly attributed to the warm water. The &s;ame al&s;o will have the effect of keeping from &s;leep. Tea, it is known, weakens the tone of the &s;tomach, by frequent u&s;e; debilitates the &s;y&s;tem, in con&s;equence, and brings on tremors and con|vul&s;ions. The &s;ame effects are not &s;o remarka|ble in coffee; but &s;till experience &s;hews them to be of the &s;ame nature. Coffee contains a great quantity of oil, of a binding quality, that corrects putrefaction. It is found to moderate fermenta|tion in the &s;tomach, and to be a powerful quieter of the &s;y&s;tem; that is, it will decrea&s;e the force and circulation of the blood, and take off the quickne&s;s and fulne&s;s of the pul&s;e; or, in other words, it will often abate a &s;light fever. For this rea&s;on it is recommended in a morning for a head-ach, which it will frequently remove. So far, indeed, taken medicinally, it may be u&s;eful; and as it a&s;&s;i&s;ts dige&s;tion, one di&s;h may not be in|jurious to tho&s;e who &s;it long after dinner, and who have &s;trong con&s;titutions; but in delicate habits, it often occa&s;ions want of &s;leep, tremors, and many of tho&s;e complaints called nervous. Newmann obtained by di&s;tillation, from one pound of
<PB N="71" REF="74">coffee, five ounces five drachms and a half of water; &s;ix ounces and half a drachm of thick foetid oil, and four ounces and two drachms of earth. In &s;hort, we may conclude, that coffee and tea, however their effects be varied by habit, or particular con&s;titutions, certainly weaken the tone of the &s;y&s;tem, and dimini&s;h the force of the nervous power.</P>
<P>Having now treated fully of the &s;everal kinds of food, we will next con&s;ider the quantity, time, and order, nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved in taking it: for health depends as much upon a proper atten|tion to this, as to the food we eat. And, in this, let the palate, or inclination, be fir&s;t con&s;ulted. Nature has endowed the &s;tomach with &s;uch &s;en&s;i|bility, that, in health, if &s;trictly attended to, &s;he will, in general, call or long, for that which is proper, and reject or loath that which is improper. It is this natural longing that has frequently pointed out, in di&s;orders, food, which, without the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of medicine, has often recovered the patient. Eat then, by no means, that, for common food, which you di&s;like. <HI>Paulo pejor &s;ed &s;uavior cibus &amp; potus meliori at ingrato, praeferendus.</HI> Agreeable food, though it be rather wor&s;e in quality, is pre|ferable to that which cloys, be it ever &s;o good.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="75">In the next place, examine your &s;tomach. Never eat any thing that lies heavy in it, or ri&s;es in it, any thing that is long in pa&s;&s;ing off, or any thing that is flatulent or windy, that occa&s;ions belchings, heart burn, gripes, or fluxes; the&s;e being &s;ure &s;ymptoms of improper dige&s;tion; the con&s;equence of which is bad. If therefore, from a depraved appetite, you &s;hould long for &s;uch food as you experimentally found to di&s;agree with you, by no means indulge it. By a re&s;olution to with&s;tand &s;uch temptations, we may keep off a number of di&s;orders: for indige&s;tion is the fore|runner of half the di&s;ea&s;es we are liable to.</P>
<P>Another thing to be con&s;idered, is the choice of food, whether &s;uch meat as you wi&s;h for, be in &s;ea&s;on or not; for that which at one time of the year is good, may, at another, be hurtful. For example, pork, during the winter, is whole&s;ome, but in &s;ummer, it is not fit to be eaten. Our ta&s;te will guide us in this; as much difference as there is in ta&s;te, between a thing in &s;ea&s;on and out of &s;ea&s;on; &s;o much is there in the goodne&s;s, and of cour&s;e, in its whole&s;omene&s;s.</P>
<P>It has been long a cu&s;tom to keep meat a con|&s;iderable time before we dre&s;s it, under a notion
<PB N="73" REF="76">of its becoming more tender and ea&s;y of dige&s;|tion. They &s;ay, when putrefaction has begun to take place in meat out of the body, it will the &s;ooner break down in the body. This may pro|bably be the ca&s;e: but what it acquires in tender|ne&s;s, it lo&s;es in its nutritive quality. It is not &s;ufficient that your meat does not &s;tink, the &s;pi|rituous part of it mu&s;t be pre&s;erved, that which gives lively and pure nouri&s;hment: meat, there|fore long kept, is not &s;o whole&s;ome as that which is fre&s;h killed. With re&s;pect to dige&s;tion, it goes on &s;ufficiently &s;oon in a healthy &s;tomach, whether the meat be tough or tender. It is not meant to &s;ay that all meats are &s;ufficiently &s;oon dige&s;ted; it has already been &s;hewn to the contrary; but what is meant, is, that in meat of the &s;ame kind and age, it is of no great con&s;equence to the eater, in point of firmne&s;s, whether it be tender, from being long kept, or tough, from being dre&s;&s;ed, when fre&s;h killed.</P>
<P>Cu&s;tom is another thing to be con&s;idered in the choice of food. What we have been longe&s;t u&s;ed to, generally agrees be&s;t with us. Change of diet is apt to cau&s;e &s;ome alteration: therefore when a new diet offers it&s;elf, as upon change of
<PB N="74" REF="77">places and countries, we &s;hould at fir&s;t be &s;paring; upon further u&s;e we may be bolder. Nay, even, with tho&s;e to whom a change of diet becomes nece&s;&s;ary, it &s;hould be brought about by degrees. <HI>Nulla &s;ubita mutatio e&s;t bona.</HI> No &s;udden change is good.</P>
<P>The next thing we &s;hould &s;tudy, is the quan|tity. Temperance and moderation in eating is nature's great pre&s;ervative. <HI>Plures gula quam gladius</HI>&mdash;the throat has de&s;troyed more than the &s;word. Some are apt to think, the more plenti|fully they eat, the better they thrive, and the &s;tronger they grow. But this is not the ca&s;e. A little well dige&s;ted, will render the body more vi|gorous than when it is glutted with &s;uperfluity, mo&s;t of which is turned to excrementitious, not alimentary fluid, and mu&s;t be &s;peedily evacuated, or &s;ickne&s;s will follow. Our &s;tomach is the be&s;t judge in &s;uch ca&s;es. We &s;hould never eat to &s;a|tiety or fulne&s;s, but de&s;i&s;t with an appetite. Thus &s;hall we be refre&s;hed; light and cheerful, not dull, heavy, or indi&s;po&s;ed. No certain quantity of food can be pre&s;cribed as a general rule: what is convenient to one, may be too much for another, and too little for a third. A &s;trong labouring
<PB N="75" REF="78">and active per&s;on may eat more freely than the weak, the &s;tudious, and &s;edentary, or &s;uch as take their ea&s;e: indeed, the active require greater &s;up|ply. By our loading the &s;tomach, fermentation is checked, and, of cour&s;e, dige&s;tion impeded; for the natural juice of the &s;tomach has not room to exert it&s;elf; it therefore nau&s;eates its contents, and is attended with belchings; the &s;pirits are clogged, ob&s;tructions en&s;ue, and fever is the con&s;equence. Hence ari&s;e various ill &s;ymptoms, and depraved effects throughout the body, enervating the &s;trength, decaying the &s;en&s;es, ha&s;tening old age, and &s;hortening of life. Though the&s;e bad effects are not in&s;tantly perceived, yet they are the certain attendants of intemperance; for it has been gene|rally ob&s;erved, in great eaters, that (though from cu&s;tom, a &s;tate of youth, and a &s;trong con&s;titu|tion, they have felt no immediate inconvenience, but have dige&s;ted their food, &s;uffered &s;urfeit, and bore their immoderate diet well) if they have not been unexpectedly cut off, they have found the &s;ymptoms of old age come on early in life, attended with pains and innumerable di&s;or|ders. In winter, indeed, we may eat more freely than in &s;ummer, becau&s;e the &s;tomach is &s;tronger, for the rea&s;ons I mentioned before, the circula|tion
<PB N="76" REF="79">of the blood not being encrea&s;ed by the heat of the weather, on the external parts of the body: but both in winter and &s;ummer, we &s;hould feed with moderation: and if we value our health, ever make it a rule to ri&s;e from table with an appetite. Should we ever be tempted to eat too much, at one time, we &s;hould eat the le&s;s at another; that is, if our dinner has been larger than ordinary, let our &s;upper be the le&s;s, or if po&s;&s;ible, none at all; for there is no man however careful of his health, that in this matter does not occa&s;ionally tran&s;|gre&s;s.</P>
<P>The next caution to be mentioned on this &s;ub|ject, are the hours of eating. Let not the com|mon cu&s;tom of meals invite you to eat, except your appetite concur with tho&s;e times. A &s;uffi|cient di&s;tance between hours of eating &s;hould be ever ob&s;erved, le&s;t we charge the &s;tomach with a fre&s;h &s;upply, before the former be pa&s;&s;ed away; for if any half dige&s;ted matter remains to be mixed with the next meal, it frequently occa&s;ions a foul &s;tomach; be&s;ides, the &s;tomach, when empty, receives the food with delight, and will be eager and &s;harp in dige&s;tion; and each part, as it pa&s;&s;es along, will perform its office readily
<PB N="77" REF="80">and &s;ufficiently. However, as &s;ome &s;tomachs will dige&s;t their contents &s;ooner than others, and if long empty, will naturally draw up from the inte&s;tines putrid vapours, which will de&s;troy the appetite, (for how often do we fa&s;t, till we lo&s;e our appetite?) and greatly di&s;turb the head and ani|mal &s;pirits; (for the head, from the great quan|tity of nerves &s;pread upon the &s;tomach, readily &s;ympathizes with it) on the&s;e accounts, let &s;uch as feel a gnawing, as it is commonly called, within them, not wait till the &s;tated hour of meals, but eat a little, that the &s;tomach may have &s;omething to work on. Hence it appears, that there can be no general hour of eating. Children, with craving appetities, do, and may eat often. Young per&s;ons in health, that labour and u&s;e much exerci&s;e, may eat three times a-day, morning, noon, and night; but to &s;uch as are in years, &s;uch as are weak, as do no work, u&s;e no exerci&s;e, or lead a &s;edentary life, eating twice in the day is &s;ufficient; or, per&s;ons weak and old, may eat often, but then it &s;hould be but little.</P>
<P>If per&s;ons confine them&s;elves to two meals a-day, one had better be a &s;upper than a dinner, pro|vided they &s;up early; becau&s;e, during the hours
<PB N="78" REF="81">of &s;leep, the body is compo&s;ed, and at re&s;t, and at this time, receives its greate&s;t nouri&s;hment. But late &s;uppers are very offen&s;ive to the whole frame, e&s;pecially to the head and eyes, from the vapours that ari&s;e from a loaded &s;tomach. Our food &s;hould be tolerably well dige&s;ted, before we lay down to &s;leep; and this is not well done un|der two or three hours. Our ance&s;tors u&s;ed to &s;up at &s;ix, and go to re&s;t at ten. Hence they could comply with that well known advice, <HI>After &s;upper walk a mile,</HI> in order to quicken dige&s;tion, and di&s;po&s;e the body for re&s;t.</P>
<P>We &s;hould not eat pre&s;ently after exerci&s;e, nor when we are hot, but forbear till the &s;pirits are retired and &s;ettled. Neither &s;hould we come to meat burthened with care or bu&s;ine&s;s; for owing to the &s;ympathy between the brain and &s;tomach, as was ob&s;erved, by means of the nerve, di&s;tur|bed mind will impede the functions of the &s;to|mach. It is for this rea&s;on, we eat in company, cheerfully with our friends. Mirth and good company are great helps to a dull &s;tomach, creators of appetite, and forwarders of dige&s;tion: and it is for this rea&s;on, lively mu&s;ic has been in|troduced at fea&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="82">We &s;hould take care al&s;o to chew our meat well; for the &s;aliva with which we thus mix it, is a great help to dige&s;tion; be&s;ides, in breaking it down with the teeth, we &s;ave the &s;tomach the trouble: to eat greedily, therefore, and &s;wallow our meat ha&s;tily, is not only indecent, but hurt|ful. With re&s;pect to drinking at meals, we &s;hould do it little and often, e&s;pecially if our food be dry and &s;olid; great draughts cau&s;e fluc|tuation, and di&s;turb fermentation.</P>
<P>Thus, having gone through the &s;everal proper|ties of the various kinds of food, and &s;hewn how far they are whole&s;ome or not, and how far they agree or di&s;agree with different con&s;titutions; in order to complete this treati&s;e upon health, we &s;hould proceed to con&s;ider the articles of exerci&s;e, temperance, re&s;t, &s;leep, &amp;c. on each of which a great deal may be &s;aid; but as that would &s;well the&s;e pages to a &s;ize that might probably deter the reader from a peru&s;al of them, it will be more political to defer it to &s;ome other time. If this is received with the approbation the &s;ubject de|&s;erves, the remainder will follow of cour&s;e.</P>
