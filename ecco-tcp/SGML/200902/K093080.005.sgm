<L>MY dears, 'tis &s;aid in days of old,</L>
<L>That bea&s;ts could talk, and birds could &s;cold.</L>
<L>But now it &s;eems the human race</L>
<L>Alone engro&s;s the &s;peaker's place.</L>
<L>Yet lately, if report be true,</L>
<L>(And much the tale relates to you)</L>
<L><PB N="182" REF="186">There met a Sparrow, Ant, and Bee,</L>
<L>Which rea&s;on'd and convers'd as we.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who reads my page will doubtle&s;s grant</L>
<L>That Phe's the wi&s;e indu&s;trious Ant.</L>

<L>Go &s;earch your &s;chool, you'll find the Bird.</L>
<L>Your &s;chool! I a&s;k your pardon fair,</L>
<L>I'm &s;ure you'll find no Sparrow there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now to my tale&mdash;One Summer's morn</L>
<L>A Bee rang'd o'er the verdant lawn;</L>
<L>Studious to hu&s;band every hour,</L>
<L>And make the mo&s;t of every flow'r.</L>
<L>Nimble from &s;talk to &s;talk &s;he flies,</L>
<L>And loads with yellow wax her thighs:</L>
<L>With which the arti&s;t builds her comb,</L>
<L>And keeps all tight and warm at home:</L>
<L>Or from the cow&s;lip's golden bells</L>
<L>Sucks honey to enrich her cells:</L>
<L>Or every tempting ro&s;e pur&s;ues,</L>
<L>Or &s;ips the lily's fragrant dews;</L>
<L>Yet never robs the &s;hining bloom,</L>
<L>Or of its beauty or perfume.</L>
<L>Thus &s;he di&s;charg'd in every way</L>
<L>The various duties of the day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It chanc'd a frugal Ant was near,</L>
<L>Who&s;e brow was wrinkled o'er by care:</L>
<L><PB N="183" REF="187">A great oeconomi&s;t was &s;he,</L>
<L>Nor le&s;s laborious than the Bee;</L>

<L>What ills ari&s;e from want of thought;</L>
<L>That poverty on &s;loth depends,</L>
<L>On poverty the lo&s;s of friends.</L>

<L>How very fortunate are we!</L>
<L>Who taught in infancy to know</L>
<L>The comforts, which from labour flow,</L>
<L>Are independent of the great,</L>
<L>Nor know the wants of pride and &s;tate.</L>
<L>Why is our food &s;o very &s;weet?</L>

<L>Their &s;age di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;trait drew near.</L>

<L>And very pert and very proud;</L>
<L>As worthle&s;s and as vain a thing,</L>
<L>Perhaps as ever wore a wing.</L>
<L>She found, as on a &s;pray &s;he &s;at,</L>
<L>The little friends were deep in chat;</L>
<L>That virtue was their favourite theme,</L>
<L>And toil and probity their &s;cheme:</L>
<L>Such talk was hateful to her brea&s;t,</L>
<L>She thought them arrant prudes at be&s;t.</L>
<L>When to di&s;play her naughty mind,</L>
<L>Hunger and cruelty combin'd;</L>
<L>She view'd the Ant with &s;avage eyes,</L>
<L>And hopt and hopt to &s;natch her prize.</L>
<L>The Bee, who watch'd her opening bill,</L>
<L>And gue&s;s'd her fell de&s;ign to kill;</L>
<L>A&s;k'd her from what her anger ro&s;e,</L>
<L>And why &s;he treated Ants as foes?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="185" REF="189">
<L>The Sparrow her reply began,</L>

<HEAD>A FIT OF THE SPLEEN. In Imitation of SHAKSPEARE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Dr. IBBOT<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Dr. Benjamin Ibbot, the &s;on of a clergyman, was born at Beacham|well, in Norfolk, about 1680, and admitted of Clare-hall, Cambridge, 25th July, 1695. He took the degree of B. A. in 1699, and that of M. A. in 1703. He was patroni&s;ed by archbi&s;hop Tenni&s;on, who made him his chaplain, trea&s;urer of the church of Wells, and rector of the united pari&s;hes of St. Veda&s;ts, alias Fo&s;ters, and St. Michael Querne. The king appointed him one of his chaplains in ordinary in 1716, and the year following he had his mandate for the degree of <HI>D. D.</HI> He afterwards became rector of St. Paul's, Shadwell, preacher-a&s;&s;i&s;tant at St. James's, in We&s;tmin&s;ter, and was in&s;talled a prebendary in the collegiate church of St. Peter therein, on the 26th November, 1724; but being then in an ill &s;tate of health, he retired for the recovery of it to Camberwell, where he died, 5th April, 1725.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<HEAD>A LETTER TO CORINNA FROM A CAPTAIN IN COUNTRY QUARTERS<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The writer of Mr. Browne's Life in the Biographia Britannica, vol.

The fact was, that a young officer, a friend of Mr. Browne's, wanted to carry a mi&s;tre&s;s with him to his country quarters; and he de&s;ired our author to write a copy of ver&s;es, to per&s;uade &s;ome lady of ea&s;y virtue to comply with his reque&s;t. Mr. Browne wrote the&s;e ver&s;es, which were de&s;igned as a &s;trong ridicule and &s;evere reproof of &s;uch kind of criminal connections; and they produced an immediate effect; for the young Gentleman gave up all thoughts of his intended companion. The whole mu&s;t be con&s;idered as written in the character of a raki&s;h officer, during a time of pro|found peace.
