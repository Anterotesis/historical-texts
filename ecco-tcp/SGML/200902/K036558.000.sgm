<SPEAKER>BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>_LORD, Mi&s;s Maria, not dre&s;&s;ed yet! &mdash;Why, there'll be a world of folks here, pre&s;ently,&mdash;e&s;pecially as my ma&s;ter has given it out that he in|tends keeping open hou&s;e till the day of Election, in favour of Sir Harry Simple.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't talk to me of dre&s;s, nor Sir Harry nei|ther; I hate him;&mdash;I wi&s;h <HI>he</HI> had been fixed to a &s;take, and burnt ye&s;terday in&s;tead of his effigy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>O fie Mi&s;s, you &s;hould not wi&s;h &s;uch cruel wi&s;hes as that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I do. But prithee trouble me no more about <HI>him;</HI> have you &s;een Mr. Trueman to-day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Love, as the &s;aying is, has given him wings: I &s;aw him fly by the hou&s;e, once or twice, but
<PB N="4" REF="4">could not get to &s;peak to him. He's purely bu&s;y, in Squire Artful's cau&s;e, not indeed out of any re&s;pect to him, but merely to oppo&s;e that goo&s;e Simple.&mdash;Well, I <HI>do</HI> think it a whim&s;ical notion of my ma&s;ter, not to marry his daughter, but to one of tho&s;e <HI>yea-and-nay</HI> creatures, called a Mem|ber of Parliament.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Marry, Betty!&mdash;Why, if he carries his Elec|tion, I won't have him.&mdash;I'd run to Scotland fir&s;t; &mdash;a poor &s;hallow-pated fop; &s;o he may &s;ave him|&s;elf both the trouble and expence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>So &s;ay I, Mi&s;s. To be &s;ure, Mr. Trueman is a much more <HI>properer</HI> man, and, as we &s;ay in our country, <HI>has</HI> got &s;ome guts in his brains.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it was not for my mamma, my pappa would be well enough, but, &s;he's always dinging in his ears, family, places, intere&s;t, and &s;uch &s;tuff. For my part, I don't &s;ee what intere&s;t &s;he'd have, if all her relations were in parliament, unle&s;s it were to frank her non&s;en&s;e into every part of the king|dom, which now &s;he can't convey, without adding &s;omething to the revenue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why there would be &s;omething in that, and not the wor&s;e for us; for, the more &s;he'd write, the le&s;s &s;he'd talk. But&mdash;ble&s;s me; who comes yonder! If Mr. Trueman is not coming thro' the hall, in di&s;gui&s;e, with &s;ome of the folks!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is he indeed!&mdash;run, then, Betty, and take care, neither my pappa and mamma comes into the room while he is here.</P>

<P>I would not for the world, Mr. Trueman, any of the family &s;hould &s;ee you here; I &s;hould lead a weary life, if they did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TRUEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>It happens very fortunately for us, that your father now keeps open hou&s;e, as I can &s;lip in and out unperceived; I provided this dre&s;s on pur|po&s;e, as in ca&s;e we <HI>&s;hould</HI> be &s;een together, I may pa&s;s off undi&s;covered.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twas a good thought; but, tell me, how have you &s;ped?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TRUEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>As well as I could wi&s;h. I <HI>do</HI> believe the day's our own: Artful readily accepted of my &s;ervices, and I have been indefatigable in his intere&s;t; up, night and day; you &s;ee my life, what <HI>you</HI> can &s;pur me to. I &s;hall think my labour well repaid, if but at la&s;t I call Maria, <HI>mine.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I make no doubt, but both my pappa and mam|ma may be brought to give their con&s;ent, if we can but up&s;et this &s;cheme of Simple's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TRUEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never doubt it. I'll try <HI>my</HI> be&s;t for it. I hav'n't been within a pair of &s;heets the&s;e &s;ix nights; no
<PB N="6" REF="6">me&s;&s;enger, or mail-carrier, has rid at once more miles, with greater expedition than I, in canva&s;|&s;ing this country for Votes. But, when Love dictates, its votaries mu&s;t obey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Mr. Trueman, I am greatly obliged to you, and, heartily wi&s;h you may &s;ucceed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TRUEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray heaven, we may! but, believe me, 'tis hot work. Simple, tho' a mere fool, &s;eems to have plenty of money, which he makes fly, like wild fire, and, gold, Maria, in this, as well as in every other ca&s;e, is the mo&s;t prevailing argument a man can u&s;e. I could get no admittance any where, without fir&s;t &s;hewing my ticket. Indeed, Artful's tongue being &s;o well oiled, &s;aves him many a guinea: the women are all in his intere&s;t, and then, you know, the men, they follow of cour&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>If gaining the favour of the women, Mr. True|man is nece&s;&s;ary, he could not have a better friend, on this occa&s;ion than you.</P>

<P>Meeting with the man appointed to deliver that letter, and de&s;iring to &s;ee the object of my love, I procured this upper habit at the expence of a crown, promi&s;ing to deliver it for him.&mdash;He is waiting at the next public hou&s;e for an an&s;wer.</P>

<P>That man mu&s;t be an unaccountable being, that does not re&s;pect one, of whom the whole country &s;peaks &s;o well. Let us then repair a broken alliance, which mu&s;t have been dreadful in its con&s;equences, by that of one, which bodes a deal of good. Take my girl
<STAGE>[joining Trueman's and Maria's hand.]</STAGE> with all a father's wi&s;hes; make her a good hu&s;band, and teach the world, that <HI>hone&s;ty is the be&s;t policy,</HI> and that 'tis more no|ble to e&s;pou&s;e integrity, than to &s;tand forth in the cau&s;e of iniquity.</P>
