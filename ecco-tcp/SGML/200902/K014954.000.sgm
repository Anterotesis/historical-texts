<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1773. Nov. 18.</NOTE>MR MACKLIN, who had attempt|ed the character of Macbeth at the Theatre in Covent Garden, having given offence to the Town, by &s;ome ha&s;ty accu&s;ations, without &s;ufficient proof, again&s;t two or three brother players, for interrupting him in his performance, was di&s;charged from that Theatre, by order of a numerous Au|dience, a&s;&s;embled, as it &s;hould &s;eem, for that purpo&s;e. On the curtain being drawn up, the cry was, <HI>No Macklin!</HI> and it increa&s;ed &s;o much, that, to prevent the hou&s;e from being pulled to
<PB N="6" REF="4">
pieces, the Managers complied with their de&s;ires, and publicly di&s;charged him: after which, there being no play ready, the money was returned, and the people di&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1774. Feb. 11.</NOTE>MR MACKLIN moved the Court of King's Bench, again&s;t &s;everal per&s;ons, for hi&s;&s;ing and otherwi&s;e in&s;ulting him, the la&s;t night he appeared in Covent Garden Theatre, to perform the part of Shylock; for preventing his going through the character; and likewi&s;e for the lo&s;s of his bread. The motion was rejected, it being ob|&s;erved, that as the Theatres were open for the reception and entertainment of that part of the Public who paid for their admi&s;&s;ion, the Audience had a right to applaud, condemn, nay re|ject what Performers they thought proper; but if any unju&s;t combination was formed previous to the opening of
<PB N="7" REF="5">
the hou&s;e, an action at Common Law might be grounded: But in the in|&s;tance then before the Court, there did not appear any room for &s;uch plea; and therefore, he was advi&s;ed to make his peace with the Town as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible. Mr Macklin had retained the Attorney and Solicitor-General, be&s;ides Me&s;&s;. Dunning, Wal|lace, &amp;c.&mdash;It is &s;aid, Mr Macklin had 74 affidavits ready to produce.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1774. May 2.</NOTE>THE Court of King's Bench was moved by Mr Dunning on behalf of Mr Macklin, for a Rule on &s;ix Gen|tlemen, to &s;hew cau&s;e why an inform|ation &s;hould not be filed again&s;t them for a riotous con&s;piracy to deprive Mr Macklin of his livelihood, by forcing the Managers of Covent Gar|den Theatre to di&s;charge Mr Macklin therefrom on the 18th November la&s;t; which Rule the Court was plea&s;ed to grant accordingly.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="6"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1774. June 11.</NOTE>CAME on before the Court of King's Bench at We&s;tmin&s;ter, the Complaint of Mr Macklin again&s;t &s;ix per&s;ons for a riotous con&s;piracy, founded on private premeditated malice, to de|prive the &s;aid Mr Macklin of his bread, by cau&s;ing him to be expelled the Theatre la&s;t Winter. The Court was plea&s;ed to grant an information again&s;t all but Mr Sparks. The Bench recommended it to the Gentlemen to make re&s;titution to Mr Macklin, and to compromi&s;e the matter without bringing the cau&s;e to trial.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1775. Feb. 24.</NOTE>CAUSE of Macklin again&s;t Clarke, Aldys, Lee, James, and Miles, came on to be tried by way of indictment, in the Court of King's Bench, before Mr Ju&s;tice A&s;ton and a &s;pecial Jury. The indictment con&s;i&s;ted of two counts; the fir&s;t &s;pecifying, That on the 18th November 1773, the defendants had
<PB N="9" REF="7">
been guilty of a riot;&mdash;the other, that they had been guilty of a con&s;piracy; both in order to cau&s;e Mr Macklin to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from their Stage by the Patentees of Covent Garden Theatre. The Judge, after hearing the evidence, and &s;umming it up with accuracy and impartiality, de&s;ired the Jury to ex|erci&s;e their judgement: And if they thought the defendants guilty of both counts, they were to find a verdict generally; if only of one count, they &s;hould find accordingly. The Jury then withdrew; and, in about twenty minutes, brought Clarke in guilty of the riot, and the others of the con&s;pi|racy. &mdash; But judgement was deferred till next term.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1775. May.</NOTE>MR JUSTICE ASTON reported to the Court of King's Bench, his minutes of the evidence on the trial of Me&s;&s;rs Leigh, Miles, James, Adys, and Clarke,
<PB N="10" REF="8">
on the 24th February la&s;t; the four fir&s;t of whom were convicted of a con&s;piracy and riot, and the latter of a riot only, in Covent Garden Theatre, on the 18th November 1773, with intent to drive Mr Macklin from the Stage.&mdash;Lord Mansfield ob&s;erved on the nature of the offence, &mdash; called it a national di&s;|grace, &mdash; and, in very &s;evere terms, reprobated the conduct of the parties concerned in it. He &s;aid, In the fir&s;t &s;tage of the bu&s;ine&s;s, he had urgently advi&s;ed the defendants to make Mr Macklin an adequate compen&s;ation for the great damage he had &s;u&s;tained;&mdash; that he then particularly pointed out as an advi&s;eable mea&s;ure, the &s;aving of the co&s;ts, by putting an end to the matter at once;&mdash;that the law-expences were now &s;welled to an enormous &s;um, which &s;um the defendants them&s;elves had given ri&s;e to, by their ob&s;tinacy and want of prudence.&mdash;Some time
<PB N="11" REF="9">
was &s;pent in the Courts, endeavouring to make an amicable adju&s;tment of the matter, and a final conclu&s;ion of it. Mr Colman was propo&s;ed as arbiter-general, which the defendants unani|mou&s;ly agreed to; but Mr Colman declined the office.&mdash;At length Mr Macklin, after recapitulating his griev|ances, informed the Court, that to &s;hew he was no way revengeful, with which he had been charged, he would be &s;a|tisfied with the defendants paying his law-expences, taking one hundred pounds worth of tickets on the night of his daughter's benefit, a &s;econd hundred pounds worth on the night of his own benefit, and a third on one of the managers nights when he &s;hould play. This plan, he ob&s;erved, was not formed on mercenary views: Its ba&s;is was to give the defendants popularity, and re&s;tore mutual amity.&mdash;Lord Mansfield paid Mr Macklin very high
<PB N="12" REF="10">
compliments on the honourable com|plexion and &s;ingular moderation of this propo&s;al. His Lord&s;hip declared it did him the highe&s;t credit;&mdash;that genero&s;ity was univer&s;ally admired in this coun|try, and there was no manner of doubt but the Public at large would honour and applaud him for his lenity. His Lord&s;hip added further, that notwith|&s;tanding his acknowledged abilities as an Actor, he never acted better in his life than he had that day. The pro|po&s;al was accepted by the parties, and the matter was thus ended.&mdash;During the cour&s;e of the bu&s;ine&s;s, Lord Man&s;|field took occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that the right of hi&s;&s;ing and applauding in a Theatre, was an unalterable right; but that there was a wide di&s;tinction be|tween expre&s;&s;ing the natural &s;en&s;ations of the mind as they aro&s;e on what was &s;een and heard, and executing a pre|concerted de&s;ign, not only to hi&s;s an
<PB N="13" REF="11">
Actor when he was playing a part in which he was univer&s;ally allowed to be excellent, but al&s;o to drive him from the Theatre, and promote his utter ruin.</P>
<P>SOON after the above deci&s;ion, the Managers of Covent Garden Theatre met, and generou&s;ly agreed to give up their claim to the hundred pounds worth of tickets.</P>
