<HEAD>Adverti&s;ement.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be proper to take notice, that the Title given this Piece, at pre&s;ent, is copied from the French of <HI>Mon&s;ieur Favart;</HI> who&s;e <HI>Caprices D' A|mour, ou Ninette a la Cour,</HI> the Author, Mr. <HI>Lloyd,</HI> confe&s;&s;es was the ground-work of his Piece, called the <HI>Capricious Lovers.</HI></P>
<P>In order to make that Piece entertaining, (and in conformity with the <HI>Italian Burletta</HI>) Mu&s;ical Dialogues have been added towards the end of each Act; the&s;e are known among the Italians by the word <HI>Finale,</HI> and are deemed indi&s;pen&s;ably ne|ce&s;&s;ary in an entertainment of this &s;ort. It is now pre&s;ented to the Public with many alterations. Several Airs have been added, others again &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed; and adapted to the talents of the diffe|rent performers, &s;ome of them being Foreigners.</P>
<P>As it was nece&s;&s;ary to alter the Title of this Opera, to that of <HI>Phillis at Court,</HI> on account of the alterations made in it, and to prevent one copy being taken for the other, 'tis hoped it will meet with the approbation of the Publick.</P>

<P>It is the &s;eat of wonders: every thing changes character here; the men are quite different; I met one who is the lord of the manor in our neighbourhood, a very proud gentleman among&s;t us, he carries his head &s;o high and &s;o fierce, and threatens folks with his cane in the country if they do but look upon him; here he was bowing and &s;craping and cringing like a &s;paniel. Why are they &s;o complai&s;ant here, the&s;e great folks who terrify and domineer over us in the country? Does the court make them &s;o much better? No, I believe, if they do any good here, 'tis only to get a right to do &s;omething bad el&s;ewhere.</P>
