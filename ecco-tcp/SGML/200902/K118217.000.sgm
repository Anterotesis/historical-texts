<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Reader will ea&s;ily perceive the&s;e Ver&s;es were begun, when my Heart was gayer, than it has been of late; and fini&s;h'd in Hours of the deepe&s;t Melancholy.</P>
<P>I hope the World will do me the Ju&s;tice to be|lieve, that no part of this flows from any <HI>real Anger</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Lady,</HI> to whom it is in&s;crib'd. Whatever unde&s;erv'd Severities I may have re|ceiv'd at her Hands, wou'd &s;he deal &s;o candidly as to acknowledge Truth, &s;he very well knows, by an Experience of many Years, that I have ever behaved my&s;elf towards her, like one, who thought it his Duty to &s;upport with Patience all Afflictions from that Quarter. Indeed if I had not been capable of <HI>forgiving</HI> a <HI>Mother,</HI> I mu&s;t have blu&s;h'd to receive Pardon <HI>my&s;elf</HI> at the Hands of my <HI>Sovereign.</HI></P>
<P>Neither to &s;ay Truth, were the manner of my Birth <HI>All,</HI> &s;hou'd I have any Rea&s;on from com|plaint&mdash;when I am a little di&s;po&s;ed to a gay turn of Thinking, I con&s;ider, as I was a <HI>De-relict</HI> from my Cradle, I have the Honour of a <HI>lawful Claim</HI> to the be&s;t Protection in <HI>Europe.</HI> For being a <HI>Spot</HI> of <HI>Earth,</HI> to which no body <HI>pre|tends</HI> a <HI>Title,</HI> I devolve naturally upon the <HI>KING,</HI> as one of the <HI>Rights</HI> of his <HI>Royalty.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="4">
While I pre&s;ume to name <HI>his MAJESTY,</HI> I look back, with Confu&s;ion, upon the <HI>Mercy</HI> I have lately experienc'd, becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible to <HI>remember</HI> it, but <HI>with</HI> &s;omething I would fain <HI>forget;</HI> for the &s;ake of my future Peace, and Alleviation of my pa&s;t Misfortune.</P>
<P>I owe my Life to the <HI>Royal Pity,</HI> if a Wretch can, with Propriety, be &s;aid to <HI>live,</HI> who&s;e Days are fewer than his Sorrows; and to whom <HI>Death</HI> had been but a <HI>Redemption</HI> from <HI>Mi&s;ery.</HI></P>
<P>But I will <HI>&s;uffer</HI> my <HI>Pardon,</HI> as my <HI>Puni&s;h|ment,</HI> till that Life, which has &s;o graciou&s;ly been given me, &s;hall become con&s;iderable enough <HI>not to be u&s;ele&s;s</HI> in his Service, to whom it was for|feited.</P>
<P>Under Influence of the&s;e Sentiments, with which his <HI>MAJESTY's</HI> great Goodne&s;s has in|&s;pired me, I con&s;ider my Lo&s;s of Fortune, and Dignity, as my Happine&s;s; to which, as I was born without Ambition, I am thrown from them without repining.&mdash;Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing tho&s;e Advanta|ges, my Care had been, perhaps, but how to <HI>enjoy</HI> Life; by the want of them I am taught this nobler Le&s;&s;on, to &s;tudy how to <HI>de&s;erve</HI> it.</P>
