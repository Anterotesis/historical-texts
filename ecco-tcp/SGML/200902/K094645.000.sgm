<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE Reader is reque&s;ted to con&s;ider the following Poem as nothing more than what a part of its title-page expre&s;&s;es,&mdash;a SKETCH, and only a &s;ketch, of the Social Pa&s;&s;ion, or Sympathetic Principle, applied, fir&s;t to the Author's particular &s;ituation, and thence ex|tended more generally, as influencing the whole animal creation.</P>
<P>Upon vi&s;iting the Villa of a friend, and finding it de&s;erted by a family extremely dear to the Author, he experienced preci&s;ely the &s;en&s;ations he has endeavoured
<PB N="vi" REF="3">to de&s;cribe. It was natural for him to pa&s;s beyond his own ca&s;e, and contemplate that of others under &s;imilar circum&s;tances. The faire&s;t productions of animated nature were before him. They occupied the &s;ame &s;pot. He was &s;eated in the mid&s;t of them. His heart dilated. If, as &s;eems to be admitted, a virtuous enthu&s;ia&s;m be nece&s;&s;ary to the proper enjoyment of &s;uch &s;cenery, the Critic of Nature will hardly know how to be offended, &s;hould he find, that here and there have been indulged effu&s;ions, which, if clo&s;ely examined when the mind is cold, may be &s;ound not altogether in &s;trict con|nection.</P>
<P>It were ea&s;y to have thrown out from the argumenta|tive parts &s;ome &s;entiments not quite in keeping with the theme; but, zealous to prove the powers of Univer&s;al
<PB N="vii" REF="4">Sympathy, the writer felt the &s;ollicitudes of an author, united with tho&s;e of a philanthropi&s;t. Of cour&s;e, the idea of obliterating what had any chance of cementing the &s;ocial affections was too painful to be adopted.</P>
<P>If, therefore, candour &s;hould urge that in &s;tepping occa&s;ionally out of his path, his intention has been rather to gather flowers than weeds, he will be forgiven. The poetical licence becomes a matter rather of right than of courte&s;y, when an author pleads his privi|lege in the cau&s;e of Benevolence. He pretends not to have pre&s;erved an exact corre&s;pondence between the &s;everal members.</P>
<P>Immethodical, however, as the poem confe&s;&s;edly is, the <HI>lucidus ordo</HI> of compo&s;ition has not been by any means
<PB N="viii" REF="5">wantonly di&s;carded; nor ought the Author to conceal (what it is, indeed, his chief pride to acknowledge) the obligations he is under to &s;ome of the fir&s;t and greate&s;t writers in this country, for many valuable hints, of which he has availed him&s;elf in the cour&s;e of the performance.</P>

<L>The fav'ring Mu&s;es join'd our evening walk,</L>
<L>Up yonder hill that rears its cre&s;t &s;ublime,</L>
<L>Where we were wont with gradual &s;teps to climb,</L>
<L>To woo the dew-bath'd zephirs on the wing,</L>
<L>And hear the Lark her earlie&s;t matin &s;ing;</L>
<L>Fa&s;t by you &s;hed, of roots and verdure made,</L>

In yonder cot ju&s;t &s;eated on the brow,</L>

<L>From land or ocean largely &s;tretch'd along,</L>
<L>The morning vapours pa&s;&s;ing through the vale,</L>
<L>The di&s;tant turret, or the le&s;&s;ening &s;ail,</L>
<L>The pointed cliff which overhangs the main,</L>
<L>The breezy upland, or the opening plain;</L>
<L>Or down yon foot-way &s;aunter'd by the &s;tream,</L>
<L>Who&s;e little rills ran tinkling to the theme;</L>
<L>More &s;oftly touch'd the woe in Hammond's lay,</L>
<L>Or laps'd re&s;pon&s;ive to the lyre of Gray;</L>
<L>O'er the&s;e dear bounds like one forlorn I roam,</L>
<L>O'er the&s;e dear bounds, I fondly call'd my home.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And yet to touch me various powers combine,</L>
<L>Here &s;ummer revels with a warmth divine;</L>
<L>The bloomy &s;ea&s;on every charm &s;upplies,</L>

Or future plenty bur&s;ting through the grain,</L>

<L>Tho&s;e fruits and flow'rs, alas! more ripe appear,</L>
<L>And the lawn &s;miles as though my friend were here;</L>
<L>From the &s;oft myrtle brighter blo&s;&s;oms &s;pring,</L>

<L>Near yonder church where we retir'd to pray,</L>

<L>The li&s;tening ru&s;tic's noble&s;t reach of thought:</L>
<L>That mode&s;t cottage and its garden &s;till</L>
<L>Seek the &s;oft &s;helter of the friendly hill;</L>
<L>The column'd &s;moke &s;till curls its wreathes around,</L>
<L>And not one le&s;&s;en'd beauty marks the bound.</L>

<L>Than when their patron &s;har'd the rich perfume:</L>

<L>But &s;oft, my friend! tho' &s;hrubs and bow'rs remain</L>
<L>The fix'd productions of th' uncon&s;cious plain;</L>

<L>Far, far from thee, this &s;un which gilds my brow</L>
<L>In deep eclip&s;e would darken all below:</L>
<L>The herds, though now plain rea&s;on &s;ees them feed,</L>
<L>Smit by her touch would langui&s;h in the mead;</L>
<L>The breeze which now di&s;ports with yonder &s;pray,</L>

<L>Thus falls a friend, but <HI>&s;he</HI> around the grave</L>

<L>In &s;olemn &s;able ev'ry flow'r appears,</L>

Ere birds, and bea&s;ts, and hills, and dales, 'tis &s;aid,</L>
