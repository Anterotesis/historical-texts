<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE love of novelty, which, in &s;ome degree, is common to all mankind, is more particularly the characteri&s;tic of that mediocrity of parts, which di&s;tingui&s;hes more than one half of the human &s;pecies. This incon&s;tant di&s;po&s;ition is never more con&s;picuous, than in what regards the article of amu&s;ement. We change our &s;entiments concerning it every moment, and the di&s;|tance between our admiration and extreme contempt, is &s;o very &s;mall, that the one is almo&s;t a &s;ure pre&s;age of the other. The poets, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to plea&s;e, if they want to pre&s;erve the fame they have once acquired, mu&s;t very often forfeit their own judgments to this variable temper of the bulk of their readers, and accommodate their writings to this un&s;ettled ta&s;te. A fame &s;o fluctuating de&s;erves not to be much valued.</P>
<P>POETRY, like virtue, receives its reward after death. The fame which men pur&s;ued in vain, when living, is often be&s;towed upon them when they are not &s;en&s;ible of it. This neglect of living authors is not altogether to be attributed to that reluctance which men &s;hew in prai&s;ing and rewarding genius. It often happens, that
<PB REF="6">
the man who writes differs greatly from the &s;ame man in common life. His foibles, however, are obliterated by death, and his better part, his writings, remain: his character is formed from them, and he that was no extraordinary man in his own time, becomes the wonder of &s;ucceeding ages.&mdash;From this &s;ource proceeds our vene|ration for the dead. Their virtues remain, but the vices, which were once blended with their virtues, have died with them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THIS con&s;ideration might induce a man, diffident of his abilities, to a&s;cribe his own compo&s;itions to a per&s;on, who&s;e remote antiquity and who&s;e &s;ituation, when alive, might well an&s;wer for faults which would be inexcu&s;able in a writer of this age. An ingenious gentle|man made this ob&s;ervation, before he knew any thing but the name of the epic poem, which is printed in the following collection. When he had read it, his &s;entiments were changed. He found it abounded too much with tho&s;e ideas, that only belong to the mo&s;t early &s;tate of &s;ociety, to be the work of a modern poet. Of this, I am per&s;uaded, the public will be as thoroughly convinced, as this gentleman was, when they &s;hall &s;ee the poems; and that &s;ome will think, notwith&s;tanding the di&s;advantages with which the works a&s;crib|ed to O&s;&s;ian appear, it would be a very uncommon in&s;tance of &s;elf|denial in me to di&s;own them, were they really of my compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>I WOULD not have dwelt &s;o long upon this &s;ubject, e&s;pecially as I have an&s;wered all rea&s;onable objections to the genuinene&s;s of the poems in the Di&s;&s;ertation, were it not on account of the prejudices of the pre&s;ent age again&s;t the ancient inhabitants of Britain, who are thought to have been incapable of the generous &s;entiments to be met with in the poems of O&s;&s;ian.&mdash;If we err in prai&s;ing too much the times of our forefathers, it is al&s;o as repugnant to good &s;en&s;e,
<PB REF="7">
to be altogether blind to the imperfections of our own. If our fa|thers had not &s;o much wealth, they had certainly fewer vices than the pre&s;ent age. Their tables, it is true, were not &s;o well provided, neither were their beds &s;o &s;oft as tho&s;e of modern times; and this, in the eyes of men who place their ultimate happine&s;s in tho&s;e conve|niences of life, gives us a great advantage over them. I &s;hall not enter farther into this &s;ubject, but only ob&s;erve, that the general poverty of a nation has not the &s;ame influence, that the indigence of indivi|duals, in an opulent country, has, upon the manners of the com|munity. The idea of meanne&s;s, which is now connected with a narrow fortune, had its ri&s;e after commerce had thrown too much property into the hands of a &s;ew; for the poorer &s;ort, imitating the vices of the rich, were obliged to have recour&s;e to roguery and cir|cumvention, in order to &s;upply their extravagance, &s;o that they were, not without rea&s;on, reckoned, in more than one &s;en&s;e, the wor&s;t of the people.</P>
<P>IT is now two years &s;ince the fir&s;t tran&s;lations from the Galic language were handed about among people of ta&s;te in Scotland. They became at la&s;t &s;o much corrupted, through the carele&s;sne&s;s of tran&s;cribers, that, for my own &s;ake, I was obliged to print the ge|nuine copies. Some other pieces were added, to &s;well the publica|tion into a pamphlet, which was entitled, Fragments of Ancient Poetry.&mdash;The Fragments, upon their fir&s;t appearance, were &s;o much approved of, that &s;everal people of rank, as well as ta&s;te, prevailed with me to make a journey into the Highlands and we&s;tern i&s;les, in order to recover what remained of the works of the old bards, e&s;pe|cially tho&s;e of O&s;&s;ian, the &s;on of Fingal, who was the be&s;t, as well as mo&s;t ancient, of tho&s;e who are celebrated in tradition for their poetical genius.&mdash;I undertook this journey, more from a de&s;ire
<PB REF="8">
of complying with the reque&s;t of my friends, than from any hopes I had of an&s;wering their expectations. I was not un&s;uce&s;sful, con|&s;idering how much the compo&s;itions of ancient times have been neglected, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, in the north of Scotland. Seve|ral gentlemen in the Highlands and i&s;les generou&s;ly gave me all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their power; and it was by their means I was en|abled to compleat the epic poem. How far it comes up to the rules of the epopaea, is the province of critici&s;m to examine. It is only my bu&s;ine&s;s to lay it before the reader, as I have found it. As it is one of the chief beauties of compo&s;ition, to be well un|der&s;tood, I &s;hall here give the &s;tory of the poem, to prevent that ob&s;curity which the introduction of characters utterly unknown might occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>ARTHO, &s;upreme king of Ireland, dying at Temora the royal palace of the Iri&s;h kings, was &s;ucceeded by Cormac, his &s;on, a minor. Cuchullin, the &s;on of Semo, lord of the <HI>I&s;le of Mi&s;t,</HI> one of the Hebrides, being at that time in Ul&s;ter, and very famous for his great exploits, was, in a convention of the petty kings and heads of tribes a&s;&s;embled for that purpo&s;e at Temora, unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en guardian to the young king.&mdash;He had not managed the affairs of Cormac long, when news was brought, that Swaran, the &s;on of Starno, king of Lochlin, or Scandinavia, intended to invade Ireland. Cuchullin immediately di&s;patched Munan, the &s;on of Stirmal, an Iri&s;h chief, to Fingal, king of tho&s;e Caledonians who inhabited the we&s;tern coa&s;t of Scotland, to implore his aid. Fingal, as well from a principle of genero&s;ity, as from his connection with the royal family of Ire|land, re&s;olved on an expedition into that country; but before his arrival, the enemy had landed in Ul&s;ter.&mdash;Cuchullin in the mean time had gathered the flower of the Iri&s;h tribes to Tura, a ca&s;tle of
<PB REF="9">
Ul&s;ter, and di&s;patched &s;couts along the coa&s;t, to give the mo&s;t early intelligence of the enemy.&mdash;Such is the &s;ituation of affairs, when the poem opens.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fing. B. I.</NOTE> CUCHULLIN, &s;itting alone beneath a tree, at the gate of Tura, for the other chiefs had gone on a hunting party to Cromla, a neighbouring hill, is informed of Swaran's landing by Moran, the &s;on of Fithil, one of his &s;couts. He convenes the chiefs; a council is held, and di&s;putes run high about giving battle to the enemy. Connal, the petty king of Togorma, and an intimate friend of Cuchullin, was for retreating till Fingal &s;hould arrive; but Calmar, the &s;on of Matha, lord of Lara, a country in Connaught, was for engaging the enemy immediately.&mdash;Cuchullin, of him&s;elf willing to fight, went into the opinion of Calmar. Marching towards the enemy, he mi&s;&s;ed three of his brave&s;t heroes, Fergus, Duchomar, and Caithbat. Fergus arriving, tells Cuchullin of the death of the two other chiefs; which introduces the affecting epi&s;ode of Morna, the daughter of Cormac&mdash;The army of Cuchullin is de&s;cried at a di&s;tance by Swaran, who &s;ent the &s;on of Arno to ob&s;erve the mo|tions of the enemy, while he him&s;elf ranged his forces in order of battle.&mdash;The &s;on of Arno returning to Swaran, de&s;cribes to him Cuchullin's chariot, and the terrible appearance of that hero. The armies engage, but night coming on, leaves the victory unde|cided. Cuchullin, according to the ho&s;pitality of the times, &s;ends to Swaran a formal invitation to a fea&s;t, by his bard Carril, the &s;on of Kin&s;ena.&mdash;Swaran refu&s;es to come. Carril relates to Cuchullin the &s;tory of Grudar and Bra&s;&s;olis. A party, by Connal's advice, is &s;ent to ob&s;erve the enemy; which clo&s;es the action of the fir&s;t day.</P>
<P><PB REF="10" MS="y">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">B. II.</NOTE> THE gho&s;t of Crugal, one of the Iri&s;h heroes who was killed in battle, appearing to Connal, foretels the defeat of Cuchullin in the next battle; and earne&s;tly advi&s;es him to make peace with Swaran. Connal communicates the vi&s;ion; but Cuchullin is inflexible from a principle of honour that he would not be the fir&s;t to &s;ue for peace, and re&s;olved to continue the war. Morning comes; Swaran pro|po&s;es di&s;honourable terms to Cuchullin, which are rejected. The battle begins, and is ob&s;tinately fought for &s;ome time, until, upon the flight of Grumal, the whole Iri&s;h army gave way. Cuchullin and Connal cover their retreat: Carril leads them to a neighbouring hill, whither they are &s;oon followed by Cuchullin him&s;elf, who de&s;cries the fleet of Fingal making towards the coa&s;t; but, night coming on, he lo&s;t &s;ight of it again. Cuchullin, dejected after his de|feat, attributes his ill &s;ucce&s;s to the death of Ferda his friend, whom he had killed &s;ome time before. Carril, to &s;hew that ill &s;ucce&s;s did not always attend tho&s;e who innocently killed their friends, intro|duces the epi&s;ode of Comal and Galvina.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">B. III.</NOTE> CUCHULLIN, plea&s;ed with Carril's &s;tory, in&s;i&s;ts with him for more of his &s;ongs. The bard relates the actions of Fingal in Lochlin, and death of Agandecca the beautiful &s;i&s;ter of Swaran. He had &s;carce fini&s;hed when Calmar the &s;on of Matha, who had advi&s;ed the fir&s;t battle, came wounded from the field, and told them of Swaran's de&s;ign to &s;urpri&s;e the remains of the Iri&s;h army. He him&s;elf propo&s;es to with&s;tand &s;ingly the whole force of the enemy, in a narrow pa&s;s, till the Iri&s;h &s;hould make good their retreat. Cuchullin, touched with the gallant propo&s;al of Calmar, re&s;olves to accompany him, and orders Carril to carry off the few that remained of the Iri&s;h. Morning comes, Calmar dies of his wounds; and, the &s;hips of the Caledo|nians appearing, Swaran gives over the pur&s;uit of the Iri&s;h, and re|turns
<PB REF="11">
to oppo&s;e Fingal's landing. Cuchullin a&s;hamed, after his de|feat, to appear before Fingal, retires to the cave of Tura. Fingal engages the enemy, puts them to flight; but the coming on of night makes the victory not deci&s;ive. The king, who had ob&s;erved the gallant behaviour of his grand&s;on O&s;car, gives him advices con|cerning his conduct in peace and war. He recommends to him to place the example of his fathers before his eyes, as the be&s;t model for his conduct; which introduces the epi&s;ode concerning Fainas&oacute;l|lis, the daughter of the king of Craca, whom Fingal had taken un|der his protection, in his youth. Fillan and O&s;car are di&s;patched to ob&s;erve the motions of the enemy by night; Gaul the &s;on of Morni de&s;ires the command of the army, in the next battle; which Fingal promi&s;es to give him. The &s;ong of the bards clo&s;es the third day.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">B. IV.</NOTE> THE action of the poem being &s;u&s;pended by night, O&s;&s;ian takes that opportunity to relate his own actions at the lake of Lego, and his court&s;hip of Evirallin, who was the mother of O&s;car, and had died &s;ome time before the expedition of Fingal into Ireland. Her gho&s;t appears to him, and tells him that O&s;car, who had been &s;ent, the beginning of the night, to ob&s;erve the enemy, was engaged with an advanced party, and almo&s;t overpowered. O&s;&s;ian relieves his &s;on; and an alarm is given to Fingal of the approach of Swaran. The king ri&s;es, calls his army together, and, as he had promi&s;ed the preceding night, devolves the command on Gaul the &s;on of Morni, while he him&s;elf, after charging his &s;ons to behave gallantly and defend his people, retires to a hill, from whence he could have a view of the battle. The battle joins; the poet relates O&s;car's great actions. But when O&s;car, in conjunction with his father, con|quered in one wing, Gaul, who was attacked by Swaran in per&s;on,
<PB REF="12">
was on the point of retreating in the other. Fingal &s;ends Ullin his bard to encourage him with a war &s;ong, but notwith&s;tanding Swaran prevails; and Gaul and his army are obliged to give way. Fingal, de&s;cending from the hill, rallies them again: Swaran de&s;i&s;ts from the pur&s;uit, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es him&s;elf of a ri&s;ing ground, re&s;tores the ranks, and waits the approach of Fingal. The king, having encouraged his men, gives the nece&s;&s;ary orders, and renews the battle. Cuchullin, who, with his friend Connal, and Carril his bard, had retired to the cave of Tura, hearing the noi&s;e, came to the brow of the hill, which overlooked the field of battle, where he &s;aw Fingal engaged with the enemy. He, being hindered by Connal from joining Fin|gal, who was him&s;elf upon the point of obtaining a complete vic|tory, &s;ends Carril to congratulate that hero on his &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">B. V.</NOTE> IN the mean time Fingal and Swaran meet; the combat is de|&s;cribed: Swaran is overcome, bound and delivered over as a pri&s;oner to the care of O&s;&s;ian and Gaul the &s;on of Morni; Fingal, his younger &s;ons, and O&s;car, &s;till pur&s;ue the enemy. The epi&s;ode of Orla a chief of Lochlin, who was mortally wounded in the battle, is in|troduced. Fingal, touched with the death of Orla, orders the pur&s;uit to be di&s;continued; and calling his &s;ons together, he is in|formed that Ryno, the younge&s;t of them, was killed. He laments his death, hears the &s;tory of Lamdarg and Gelcho&s;&s;a, and returns towards the place where he had left Swaran. Carril, who had been &s;ent by Cuchullin to congratulate Fingal on his victory, comes in the mean time to O&s;&s;ian. The conver&s;ation of the two poets clo&s;es the action of the fourth day.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">B. VI.</NOTE> NIGHT comes on. Fingal gives a &s;ea&s;t to his army, at which Swaran is pre&s;ent. The king commands Ullin his bard to give the
<PB REF="13">
<HI>&s;ong of peace;</HI> a cu&s;tom always ob&s;erved at the end of a war. Ullin relates the actions of Trenmor, great grandfather to Fingal, in Scan|dinavia, and his marriage with Inibaca, the daughter of a king of Lochlin who was ance&s;tor to Swaran; which con&s;ideration, toge|ther with his being brother to Agandecca, with whom Fingal was in love in his youth, induced the king to relea&s;e him, and permit him to return, with the remains of his army, into Lochlin, upon his promi&s;e of never returning to Ireland, in a ho&s;tile manner. The night is &s;pent in &s;ettling Swaran's departure, in &s;ongs of bards, and in a conver&s;ation in which the &s;tory of Grumal is introduced by Fingal. Morning comes. Swaran departs; Fingal goes on a hunt|ing party, and finding Cuchullin in the cave of Tura, comforts him, and &s;ets &s;ail, the next day, for Scotland; which concludes the poem.</P>
<P>THE &s;tory of this poem is &s;o little interlarded with fable, that one cannot help thinking it the genuine hi&s;tory of Fingal's expedi|tion, embelli&s;hed by poetry. In that ca&s;e, the compo&s;itions of O&s;|&s;ian are not le&s;s valuable for the light they throw on the ancient &s;tate of Scotland and Ireland than they are for their poetical merit. Succeeding generations founded on them all their traditions con|cerning that period; and they magnified or varied them, in propor|tion as they were &s;wayed by credulity or de&s;ign. The bards of Ireland, by a&s;cribing to O&s;&s;ian compo&s;itions which are evidently their own, have occa&s;ioned a general belief, in that country, that Fingal was of Iri&s;h extraction, and not of the ancient Caledonians, as is &s;aid in the genuine poems of O&s;&s;ian. The incon&s;i&s;tencies be|tween tho&s;e &s;purious pieces prove the ignorance of their authors. In one of them O&s;&s;ian is made to mention him&s;elf as bapti&s;ed by St. Patrick, in another he &s;peaks of the famous cru&s;ade, which was not begun in Europe for many centuries after.</P>
<P><PB REF="14">
THOUGH this anachroni&s;m quite de&s;troys the authority of the bards with re&s;pect to Fingal; yet their de&s;ire to make him their countryman &s;hews how famous he was in Ireland as well as in the north of Scotland.</P>
<P>HAD the Senachies of Ireland been as well acquainted with the antiquities of their nation as they pretended, they might derive as much honour from Fingal's being a Caledonian, as if he had been an Iri&s;hman; for both nations were almo&s;t the &s;ame people in the days of that hero. The Celtae, who inhabited Britain and Ireland before the inva&s;ion of the Romans, though they were divided into numerous tribes, yet, as the &s;ame language and cu&s;toms, and the me|mory of their common origin remained among them, they con&s;idered them&s;elves as one nation. After South Britain became a province of Rome, and its inhabitants begun to adopt the language and cu&s;toms of their conquerors, the Celtae beyond the pale of the empire, con|&s;idered them as a di&s;tinct people, and con&s;equently treated them as enemies. On the other hand, the &s;tricte&s;t amity &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the Iri&s;h and Scots Celtae for many ages, and the cu&s;toms and an|cient language of both &s;till remaining, leave no room to doubt that they were of old one and the &s;ame nation.</P>
<P>IT was at fir&s;t intended to prefix to O&s;&s;ian's poems a di&s;cour&s;e con|cerning the ancient inhabitants of Britain; but as a gentleman, in the north of Scotland, who has thoroughly examined the antiquities of this i&s;land, and is perfectly acquainted with all the branches of the Celtic tongue, is ju&s;t now preparing for the pre&s;s a work on that &s;ubject, the curious are referred to it.</P>

<HEAD>A DISSERTATION CONCERNING THE ANTIQUITY, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the POEMS of OSSIAN the Son of FINGAL.</HEAD>
<P>INQUIRIES into the antiquities of nations afford more plea&s;ure than any real advantage to mankind. The ingenious may form &s;y&s;tems of hi&s;tory on probabilities and a few facts; but at a great di&s;tance of time, their accounts mu&s;t be vague and uncertain. The infancy of &s;tates and kingdoms is as de&s;titute of great events, as of the means of tran&s;mitting them to po&s;terity. The arts of poli&s;hed life, by which alone facts can be pre&s;erved with certainty, are the production of a well formed community. It is then hi&s;torians begin to write, and public tran&s;actions to be worthy remembrance. The actions of former times are left in ob&s;curity, or magnified by uncer|tain traditions. Hence it is that we find &s;o much of the marvellous in the origin of every nation; po&s;terity being always ready to believe any thing, however fabulous, that reflects honour on their ance&s;tors. The Greeks and Romans were remarkable for this weakne&s;s. They &s;wallowed the mo&s;t ab&s;urd fables concerning the high antiquities of their re&s;pective nations. Good hi&s;torians, however, ro&s;e very early
<PB N="ii" REF="16">
among&s;t them, and tran&s;mitted, with lu&s;tre, their great actions to po&s;terity. It is to them that they owe that unrivalled fame they now enjoy, while the great actions of other nations are involved in fables, or lo&s;t in ob&s;curity. The Celtic nations afford a &s;triking in|&s;tance of this kind. They, though once the ma&s;ters of Europe from the mouth of the river Oby, in Ru&s;&s;ia, to Cape Fini&s;tere, the we&s;tern point of Gallicia in Spain, are very little mentioned in hi|&s;tory.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">lin. l. 6.</NOTE> They tru&s;ted their fame to tradition and the &s;ongs of their bards, which, by the vici&s;&s;itude of human affairs, are long &s;ince lo&s;t. Their ancient language is the only monument that remains of them; and the traces of it being found in places &s;o widely di&s;tant of each other, &s;erves only to &s;hew the extent of their ancient power, but throws very little light on their hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>OF all the Celtic nations, that which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed old Gaul is the mo&s;t renowned; not perhaps on account of worth &s;uperior to the re&s;t, but for their wars with a people who had hi&s;torians to tran&s;|mit the fame of their enemies, as well as their own, to po&s;terity. Britain was fir&s;t peopled by them, according to the te&s;timony of the be&s;t authors;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cae&s;. l. 5. Tac. Agric. l. 1. c. 2.</NOTE> its &s;ituation in re&s;pect to Gaul makes the opinion pro|bable; but what puts it beyond all di&s;pute, is that the &s;ame cu|&s;toms and language prevailed among the inhabitants of both in the days of Julius Cae&s;ar.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cae&s;ar. Pomp. Mel. Tacitus.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE colony from Gaul po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves, at fir&s;t, of that part of Britain which was next to their own country; and &s;preading northward, by degrees, as they increa&s;ed in numbers, peopled the whole i&s;land. Some adventurers pa&s;&s;ing over from tho&s;e parts of Britain that are within &s;ight of Ireland, were the founders of the Iri&s;h nation: which is a more probable &s;tory than the idle fables of Mile&s;ian and Gallician colonies.

thing well known in his time, that the inhabitants of Ireland were originally Britons; and his te&s;timony is unque&s;tionable, when we con&s;ider that, for many ages, the language and cu&s;toms of both na|tions were the &s;ame.</P>
<P>TACITUS was of opinion that the ancient Caledonians were of German extract. By the language and cu&s;toms which always pre|vailed in the North of Scotland, and which are undoubtedly Celtic, one would be tempted to differ in opinion from that celebrated wri|ter. The Germans, properly &s;o called, were not the &s;ame with the ancient Celtae. The manners and cu&s;toms of the two nations were &s;imilar; but their language different. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Strabo 1. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> The Germans are the ge|nuine de&s;cendants of the ancient Daae, afterwards well known by the name of Daci, and pa&s;&s;ed originally into Europe by the way of the northern countries, and &s;ettled beyond the Danube, towards the va&s;t regions of Tran&s;ilvania, Wallachia, and Moldavia; and from thence advanced by degrees into Germany. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cae&s;. l. 6.

<P>BUT whether the Caledonians were a colony of the Celtic Ger|mans, or the &s;ame with the Gauls that fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of Britain, is a matter of no moment at this di&s;tance of time. What|ever their origin was, we find them very numerous in the time of Julius Agricola, which is a pre&s;umption that they were long before &s;ettled in the country. The form of their government was a mix|ture of ari&s;tocracy and monarchy, as it was in all the countries where the Druids bore the chief &s;way. This order of men &s;eems to have been formed on the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem with the Dactyli Idaei and Curetes
<PB N="iv" REF="18">
of the ancients. Their pretended intercour&s;e with heaven, their magic and divination were the &s;ame. The knowledge of the Druids in natural cau&s;es, and the properties of certain things, the fruit of the experiments of ages gained them a mighty reputation among the people. The e&s;teem of the populace &s;oon increa&s;ed into a venera|tion for the order; which a cunning and ambitious tribe of men took care to improve, to &s;uch a degree, that they, in a manner, in|gro&s;&s;ed the management of civil, as well as religious, matters. It is generally allowed that they did not abu&s;e this extraordinary power; the pre&s;erving their character of &s;anctity was &s;o e&s;&s;ential to their in|fluence, that they never broke out into violence or oppre&s;&s;ion. The chiefs were allowed to execute the laws, but the legi&s;lative power was entirely in the hands of the Druids. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cae&s;. l. 6.</NOTE> It was by their authority that the tribes were united, in times of the greate&s;t danger, under one head. This temporary king, or Vergobretus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fer-gu|breth, <HI>the man to judge.</HI></NOTE> was cho&s;en by them, and generally laid down his office at the end of the war. The&s;e prie&s;ts enjoyed long this extraordinary privilege among the Celtic nations who lay beyond the pale of the Roman empire. It was in the beginning of the &s;econd century that their power among the Ca|ledonians begun to decline. The poems that celebrate Trathal and Cormac, ance&s;tors to Fingal, are full of particulars concerning the fall of the Druids, which account for the total &s;ilence concerning their religion in the poems that are now given to the public.</P>
<P>THE continual wars of the Caledonians again&s;t the Romans hin|dered the nobility from initiating them&s;elves, as the cu&s;tom for|merly was, into the order of the Druids. The precepts of their religion were confined to a few, and were not much attended to by a people inured to war. The Vergobretus, or chief magi&s;trate, was cho&s;en without the concurrence of the hierarchy, or continued in his office again&s;t their will. Continual power &s;trengthened his in|tere&s;t
<PB N="v" REF="19">
among the tribes, and enabled him to &s;end down, as heredi|tary to his po&s;terity, the office he had only received him&s;elf by election.</P>
<P>On occa&s;ion of a new war again&s;t the <HI>King of the World,</HI> as the poems emphatically call the Roman emperor, the Druids, to vindi|cate the honour of the order, began to re&s;ume their ancient privi|lege of chu&s;ing the Vergobretus. Garmal, the &s;on of Tarno, being deputed by them, came to the grandfather of the celebrated Fingal, who was then Vergobretus, and commanded him, in the name of the whole order, to lay down his office. Upon his refu&s;al, a civil war commenced, which &s;oon ended in almo&s;t the total extinction of the religious order of the Druids. A few that remained, retired to the dark rece&s;&s;es of their groves, and the caves they had formerly u&s;ed for their meditations. It is then we find them in <HI>the circle of &s;tones,</HI> and unheeded by the world. A total di&s;regard for the order, and utter abhorrence of the Druidical rites en&s;ued. Under this cloud of public hate, all that had any knowledge of the religion of the Druids became extinct, and the nation &s;ell into the la&s;t degree of ignorance of their rites and ceremonies.</P>
<P>IT is no matter of wonder then, that Fingal and his &s;on O&s;&s;ian make &s;o little, if any, mention of the Druids; who were the declared enemies to their &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the &s;upreme magi&s;tracy. It is a &s;ingular ca&s;e, it mu&s;t be allowed, that there are no traces of religion in the poems a&s;cribed to O&s;&s;ian; as the poetical compo&s;itions of other nations are &s;o clo&s;ely connected with their mythology. It is hard to account for it to tho&s;e who are not made acquainted with the manner of the old Scotti&s;h bards. That race of men carried their notions of mar|tial honour to an extravagant pitch. Any aid given their heroes in battle, was thought to derogate from their fame; and the bards
<PB N="vi" REF="20">
immediately transferred the glory of the action to him who had given that aid.</P>
<P>HAD O&s;&s;ian brought down gods, as often as Homer hath done, to a&s;&s;i&s;t his heroes, this poem had not con&s;i&s;ted of elogiums on his friends, but of hymns to the&s;e &s;uperior beings. To this day, tho&s;e that write in the Galic language &s;eldom mention religion in their profane poetry; and when they profe&s;&s;edly write of religion, they never interlard with their compo&s;itions, the actions of their heroes. This cu&s;tom alone, even though the religion of the Druids had not been previou&s;ly extingui&s;hed, may, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, account for O&s;&s;ian's &s;ilence concerning the religion of his own times.</P>
<P>To &s;ay, that a nation is void of all religion, is the &s;ame thing as to &s;ay, that it does not con&s;i&s;t of people endued with rea&s;on. The traditions of their fathers, and their own ob&s;ervations on the works of nature, together with that &s;uper&s;tition which is inherent in the human frame, have, in all ages, rai&s;ed in the minds of men &s;ome idea of a &s;uperior being.&mdash;Hence it is, that in the darke&s;t times, and among&s;t the mo&s;t barbarous nations, the very populace them&s;elves had &s;ome faint notion, at lea&s;t, of a divinity. It would be doing inju&s;tice to O&s;&s;ian, who, upon no occa&s;ion, &s;hews a narrow mind, to think, that he had not opened his conceptions to that primitive and greate&s;t of all truths. But let O&s;&s;ian's religion be what it will, it is certain he had no knowledge of Chri&s;tianity, as there is not the lea&s;t allu&s;ion to it, or any of its rites, in his poems; which ab&s;olutely fixes him to an aera prior to the introduction of that religion. The per&s;ecution begun by Diocle&s;ian, in the year 303, is the mo&s;t probable time in which the fir&s;t dawning of Chri|&s;tianity in the north of Britain can be fixed.&mdash;The humane and mild character of Con&s;tantius Chlorus, who commanded then in
<PB N="vii" REF="21">
Britain, induced the per&s;ecuted Chri&s;tians to take refuge under him. Some of them, through a zeal to propagate their tenets, or through fear, went beyond the pale of the Roman empire, and &s;ettled among the Caledonians; who were the more ready to hearken to their doctrines, as the religion of the Druids had been exploded &s;o long before.</P>
<P>THESE mi&s;&s;ionaries, either through choice, or to give more weight to the doctrine they advanced, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the cells and groves of the Druids; and it was from this retired life they had the name of <HI>Culdees,</HI> which in the language of the country<NOTE PLACE="marg">Culdich.</NOTE> &s;ignified <HI>&s;eque&s;tered per&s;ons.</HI> It was with one of the <HI>Culdees</HI> that O&s;&s;ian, in his extreme old age, is &s;aid to have di&s;puted concerning the Chri&s;tian religion. This di&s;pute is &s;till extant, and is couched in ver&s;e, ac|cording to the cu&s;tom of the times. The extreme ignorance on the part of O&s;&s;ian, of the Chri&s;tian tenets, &s;hews, that that religion had only been lately introduced, as it is not ea&s;y to conceive, how one of the fir&s;t rank could be totally unacquainted with a religion that had been known for any time in the country. The di&s;|pute bears the genuine marks of antiquity. The ob&s;olete phra&s;es and expre&s;&s;ions peculiar to the times, prove it to be no forgery. If O&s;&s;ian then lived at the introduction of Chri&s;tianity, as by all ap|pearance he did, his epoch will be the latter end of the third, and beginning of the fourth century. What puts this point beyond di&s;|pute, is the allu&s;ion in his poems to the hi&s;tory of the times.</P>

A complete poem, which relates to this &s;ubject, is printed in this collection.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="22">
IN the year 210 the emperor Severus, after returning from his ex|peditions again&s;t the Caledonians, at York fell into the tidious ill|ne&s;s of which he afterwards died. The Caledonians and Maiatae, re&s;uming courage from his indi&s;po&s;ition, took arms in order to re|cover the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions they had lo&s;t. The enraged emperor com|manded his army to march into their country, and to de&s;troy it with fire and &s;word. His orders were but ill executed, for his &s;on, Ca|racalla, was at the head of the army, and his thoughts were entirely taken up with the hopes of his father's death, and with &s;chemes to &s;upplant his brother Geta.&mdash;He &s;carcely had entered the enemy's country, when news was brought him that Severus was dead.&mdash;A &s;udden peace is patched up with the Caledonians, and, as it appears from Dion Ca&s;&s;ius, the country they had lo&s;t to Severus was re|&s;tored to them.</P>
<P>THE Caracul of Fingal is no other than Caracalla, who, as the &s;on of Severus, the Emperor of Rome, who&s;e dominions were ex|tended almo&s;t over the known world, was not without rea&s;on called in the poems of O&s;&s;ian, <HI>the Son of the King of the World.</HI> The &s;pace of time between 211, the year Severus died, and the begin|ning of the fourth century, is not &s;o great, but O&s;&s;ian the &s;on of Fingal, might have &s;een the Chri&s;tians whom the per&s;ecution under Diocle&s;ian had driven beyond the pale of the Roman empire.</P>
<P>OSSIAN, in one of his many lamentations on the death of his beloved &s;on O&s;car, mentions among his great actions, a battle which he fought again&s;t Caros, king of &s;hips, on the banks of the winding Carun.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Car-avon, <HI>Winding ri|ver.</HI></NOTE> It is more than probable, that the Caros mentioned here, is the &s;ame with the noted u&s;urper Carau&s;ius, who a&s;&s;umed the purple in the year 287, and &s;eizing on Britain, defeated the emperor Maximian Herculius, in &s;everal naval engagements, which gives propriety to
<PB N="ix" REF="23">
his being called in O&s;&s;ian's poems, <HI>the King of Ships.</HI> The <HI>winding Carun</HI> is that &s;mall river retaining &s;till the name of Carron, and runs in the neighbourhood of Agricola's wall, which Carau&s;ius repaired to ob&s;truct the incur&s;ions of the Caledonians. Several other pa&s;&s;ages in the poems allude to the wars of the Romans; but the two ju&s;t mentioned clearly fix the epoch of Fingal to the third century; and this account agrees exactly with the Iri&s;h hi&s;tories, which place the death of Fingal, the &s;on of Comhal, in the year 283, and that of O&s;car and their own celebrated Cairbre, in the year 296.</P>
<P>SOME people may imagine, that the allu&s;ions to the Roman hi&s;|tory might have been indu&s;triou&s;ly in&s;erted into the poems, to give them the appearance of antiquity. This fraud mu&s;t then have been committed at lea&s;t three ages ago, as the pa&s;&s;ages in which the allu&s;ions are made, are alluded to often in the compo&s;itions of tho&s;e times.</P>
<P>EVERY one knows what a cloud of ignorance and barbari&s;m over&s;pread the north of Europe three hundred years ago. The minds of men, addicted to &s;uper&s;tition, contracted a narrowne&s;s that de&s;troyed genius. Accordingly we find the compo&s;itions of tho&s;e times trivial and puerile to the la&s;t degree. But let it be allowed, that, amid&s;t all the untoward circum&s;tances of the age, a genius might ari&s;e, it is not ea&s;y to determine what could induce him to give the honour of his compo&s;itions to an age &s;o remote. We find no fact that he has advanced, to favour any de&s;igns which could be entertained by any man who lived in the fifteenth century. But &s;hould we &s;uppo&s;e a poet, through humour, or for rea&s;ons which cannot be &s;een at this di&s;tance of time, would a&s;cribe his own com|po&s;itions to O&s;&s;ian, it is next to impo&s;&s;ible, that he could impo&s;e
<PB N="x" REF="24">
upon his countrymen, when all of them were &s;o well acquainted with the traditional poems of their ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>THE &s;tronge&s;t objection to the authenticity of the poems now given to the public under the name of O&s;&s;ian, is the improbability of their being handed down by tradition through &s;o many centuries. Ages of barbari&s;m &s;ome will &s;ay, could not produce poems abound|ing with the di&s;intere&s;ted and generous &s;entiments &s;o con&s;picuous in the compo&s;itions of O&s;&s;ian; and could the&s;e ages produce them, it is impo&s;&s;ible but they mu&s;t be lo&s;t, or altogether corrupted in a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of barbarous generations.</P>
<P>THESE objections naturally &s;ugge&s;t them&s;elves to men unac|quainted with the ancient &s;tate of the northern parts of Britain. The bards, who were an inferior order of the Druids, did not &s;hare their bad fortune. They were &s;pared by the victorious king, as it was through their means only he could hope for immortality to his fame. They attended him in the camp, and contributed to e&s;tabli&s;h his power by their &s;ongs. His great actions were magni|fied, and the populace, who had no ability to examine into his cha|racter narrowly, were dazzled with his fame in the rhimes of the bards. In the mean time, men a&s;&s;umed &s;entiments that are rarely to be met with in an age of barbari&s;m. The bards who were originally the di&s;ciples of the Druids, had their minds opened, and their ideas enlarged, by being initiated in the learning of that celebrated order. They could form a perfect hero in their own minds, and a&s;cribe that character to their prince. The inferior chiefs made this ideal character the model of their conduct, and by degrees brought their minds to that generous &s;pirit which breathes in all the poetry of the times. The prince, flattered by
<PB N="xi" REF="25">
his bards, and rivalled by his own heroes, who imitated his cha|racter as de&s;cribed in the eulogies of his poets, endeavoured to excel his people in merit, as he was above them in &s;tation. This emulation continuing, formed at la&s;t the general character of the nation, happily compounded of what is noble in barbarity, and virtuous and generous in a poli&s;hed people.</P>
<P>WHEN virtue in peace, and bravery in war, are the characteri&s;tics of a nation, their actions become intere&s;ting, and their fame worthy of immortality. A generous &s;pirit is warmed with noble actions, and becomes ambitious of perpetuating them. This is the true &s;ource of that divine in&s;piration, to which the poets of all ages pre|tended. When they found their themes inadequate to the warmth of their imaginations, they varni&s;hed them over with fables, &s;up|plied by their own fancy, or furni&s;hed by ab&s;urd traditions. The&s;e fables, however ridiculous, had their abettors; po&s;terity either im|plicitly believed them, or through a vanity natural to mankind, pretended that they did. They loved to place the founders of their families in the days of fable, when poetry, without the fear of contradiction, could give what characters &s;he plea&s;ed of her heroes. It is to this vanity that we owe the pre&s;ervation of what remain of the works of O&s;&s;ian. His poetical merit made his heroes famous in a country where heroi&s;m was much e&s;teemed and admired. The po&s;terity of the&s;e heroes, or tho&s;e who pretended to be de&s;cended from them, heard with plea&s;ure the culogiums of their ance&s;tors; bards were employed to repeat the poems, and to record the con|nection of their patrons with chiefs &s;o renowned. Every chief in proce&s;s of time had a bard in his family, and the office became at la&s;t hereditary. By the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the&s;e bards, the poems con|cerning the ance&s;tors of the family were handed down from ge|neration to generation; they were repeated to the whole clan on
<PB N="xii" REF="26">
&s;olemn occa&s;ions, and always alluded to in the new compo&s;itions o the bards. This cu&s;tom came down near to our own times; and after the bards were di&s;continued, a great number in a clan retained by memory, or committed to writing, their compo&s;itions, and found|ed the antiquity of their families on the authority of their poems.</P>
<P>THE u&s;e of letters was not known in the North of Europe till long after the in&s;titution of the bards: the records of the families of their patrons, their own, and more ancient poems were handed down by tradition. Their poetical compo&s;itions were admirably contrived for that purpo&s;e. They were adapted to mu&s;ic; and the mo&s;t per|fect harmony ob&s;erved. Each ver&s;e was &s;o connected with tho&s;e which preceded or followed it, that if one line had been remember|ed in a &s;tanza, it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to forget the re&s;t. The ca|dences followed in &s;o natural a gradation, and the words were &s;o adapted to the common turn of the voice, after it is rai&s;ed to a cer|tain key, that it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, from a &s;imilarity of &s;ound, to &s;ub&s;titute one word for another. This excellence is peculiar to the Celtic tongue, and is perhaps to be met with in no other language. Nor does this choice of words clog the &s;en&s;e or weaken the expre&s;|&s;ion. The numerous flections of con&s;onants, and variation in de|clen&s;ion, make the language very copious.</P>
<P>THE de&s;cendants of the Celtae, who inhabited Britain and its i&s;les, were not &s;ingular in this method of pre&s;erving the mo&s;t precious monuments of their nation. The ancient laws of the Greeks were couched in ver&s;e, and handed down by tradition. The Spartans, through a long habit, became &s;o fond of this cu&s;tom, that they would never allow their laws to be committed to writing. The ac|tions of great men, and the elogiums of kings and heroes were pre|&s;erved in the &s;ame manner. All the hi&s;torical monuments of the
<PB N="xiii" REF="27">
old Germans were comprehended in their ancient &s;ongs; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tacitus de mor. Germ.</NOTE> which were either hymns to their gods, or elegies in prai&s;e of their he|roes, and were intended to perpetuate the great events in their na|tion which were carefully interwoven them. This &s;pecies of com|po&s;ition was not committed to writing, but delivered by oral tradi|tion. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Abb&eacute; de la Bleterie Re|marques &s;ur la Germanie.</HI></NOTE> The care they took to have the poems taught to their chil|dren, the uninterrupted cu&s;tom of repeating them upon certain oc|ca&s;ions, and the happy mea&s;ure of the ver&s;e, &s;erved to pre&s;erve them for a long time uncorrupted. This oral chronicle of the Germans was not forgot in the eighth century, and it probably would have re|mained to this day, had not learning, which thinks every thing, that is not committed to writing, fabulous, been introduced. It was from poetical traditions that Garcilla&s;&s;o compo&s;ed his account of the Yncas of Peru. The Peruvians had lo&s;t all other monuments of their hi&s;tory, and it was from ancient poems which his mother, a prince&s;s of the blood of the Yncas, taught him in his youth, that he collected the materials of his hi&s;tory. If other nations then, that had been often overun by enemies, and had &s;ent abroad and received colonies, could, for many ages, pre&s;erve, by oral tradition, their laws and hi&s;tories uncorrupted, it is much more probable that the ancient Scots, a people &s;o free of intermixture with foreigners, and &s;o &s;trongly attached to the memory of their ance&s;tors, had the works of their bards handed down with great purity.</P>
<P>IT will &s;eem &s;trange to &s;ome, that poems admired for many cen|turies in one part of this kingdom &s;hould be hitherto unknown in the other; and that the Briti&s;h, who have carefully traced out the works of genius in other nations, &s;hould &s;o long remain &s;trangers to their own. This, in a great mea&s;ure, is to be imputed to tho&s;e who under&s;tood both languages and never attempted a tran&s;lation. They, from being acquainted but with detached pieces, or from a
<PB N="xiv" REF="28">
mode&s;ty, which perhaps the pre&s;ent tran&s;lator ought, in prudence, to have followed, de&s;paired of making the compo&s;itions of their bards agreeable to an Engli&s;h reader. The manner of tho&s;e com|po&s;itions is &s;o different from other poems, and the ideas &s;o confined to the mo&s;t early &s;tate of &s;ociety, that it was thought they had not enough of variety to plea&s;e a poli&s;hed age.</P>
<P>THIS was long the opinion of the tran&s;lator of the following col|lection; and though he admired the poems, in the original, very early, and gathered part of them from tradition for his own amu&s;e|ment, yet he never had the &s;malle&s;t hopes of &s;eeing them in an Engli&s;h dre&s;s. He was &s;en&s;ible that the &s;trength and manner of both languages were very different, and that it was next to impo&s;|&s;ible to tran&s;late the Galic poetry into any thing of tolerable Engli&s;h ver&s;e; a pro&s;e tran&s;lation he could never think of, as it mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily fall &s;hort of the maje&s;ty of an original. It was a gentleman, who has him&s;elf made a figure in the poetical world, that gave him the fir&s;t hint concerning a literal pro&s;e tran&s;lation. He tried it at his de&s;ire, and the &s;pecimen was approved. Other gentlemen were earne&s;t in exhorting him to bring more to the light, and it is to their uncommon zeal that the world owes the Galic poems, if they have any merit.</P>
<P>IT was at fir&s;t intended to make a general collection of all the an|cient pieces of genius to be found in the Galic language; but the tran&s;lator had his rea&s;ons for confining him&s;elf to the remains of the works of O&s;&s;ian. The action of the poem that &s;tands the fir&s;t, was not the greate&s;t or mo&s;t celebrated of the exploits of Fingal. His wars were very numerous, and each of them afforded a theme which employed the genius of his &s;on. But, excepting the pre&s;ent poem, tho&s;e pieces are irrecoverably lo&s;t, and there only remain a few fragments
<PB N="xv" REF="29">
in the hands of the tran&s;lator. Tradition has &s;till pre&s;erved, in many places, the &s;tory of the poems, and many now living have heard them, in their youth, repeated.</P>
<P>THE complete work, now printed, would, in a &s;hort time, have &s;hared the fate of the re&s;t. The genius of the highlanders has &s;uf|fered a great change within the&s;e few years. The communication with the re&s;t of the i&s;land is open, and the introduction of trade and manufactures has de&s;troyed that lei&s;ure which was formerly dedicated to hearing and repeating the poems of ancient times. Many have now learned to leave their mountains, and &s;eek their fortunes in a milder climate; and though a certain <HI>amor patriae</HI> may &s;ometimes bring them back, they have, during their ab&s;ence, imbibed enough of foreign manners to de&s;pi&s;e the cu&s;toms of their ance&s;tors. Bards have been long difu&s;ed, and the &s;pirit of genealogy has greatly &s;ub|&s;ided. Men begin to be le&s;s devoted to their chiefs, and con&s;an|guinity is not &s;o much regarded. When property is e&s;tabli&s;hed, the human mind confines its views to the plea&s;ure it procures. It does not go back to antiquity, or look forward to &s;ucceeding ages. The cares of life increa&s;e, and the actions of other times no longer amu&s;e. Hence it is, that the ta&s;te for their ancient poetry is at a low ebb among the highlanders. They have not, however, thrown off the good qualities of their ance&s;tors. Ho&s;pitality &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, and an uncommon civility to &s;trangers. Friend&s;hip is inviolable, and re|venge le&s;s blindly followed than formerly.</P>
<P>To &s;ay any thing, concerning the poetical merit of the poems, would be an anticipation on the judgment of the public. The poem which &s;tands fir&s;t in the collection is truly epic. The characters are &s;trongly marked, and the &s;entiments breathe heroi&s;m. The &s;ubject of it is an inva&s;ion of Ireland by Swaran king of Lochlin, which is the

Cu|chullin when very young married Bragela the daughter of Sorglan, and pa&s;&s;ing over into Ireland, lived for &s;ome time with Con|nal, grand&s;on by a daughter to Congal the petty king of Ul&s;ter. His wi&s;dom and valour in a &s;hort time gained him &s;uch reputation, that in the minority of Cor|mac the &s;upreme king of Ireland, he was cho&s;en guardian to the young king, and &s;ole manager of the war again&s;t Swaran king of Lochlin. After a &s;eries of great actions he was killed in battle &s;omewhere in Connaught, in the twenty-&s;eventh year of his age. He was &s;o remarkable for his &s;trength, that to de&s;cribe a &s;trong man it has pa&s;&s;ed into a proverb, <Q REND="inline">"He has the &s;trength of Cuchullin."</Q> They &s;hew the re|mains of his palace at Dun&s;caich in the I&s;le of Skye; and a &s;tone to which he bound his dog Luath, goes &s;till by his name.</NOTE> &s;at by Tura's wall; by the tree of the ru&s;t|ling leaf.&mdash;His &s;pear leaned again&s;t the mo&s;&s;y rock.

She came in all her beauty, like the moon from the cloud of the ea&s;t.&mdash;Loveline&s;s was around her as light. Her &s;teps were like the mu&s;ic of &s;ongs. She &s;aw the youth and loved him. He was the &s;tolen &s;igh of her &s;oul. Her blue eye rolled on him in &s;ecret: and &s;he ble&s;t the chief of Morven.</P>
<P>THE third day with all its beams, &s;hone bright on the wood of boars. Forth moved the dark-browed Starno; and Fingal, king of &s;hields. Half the day they &s;pent in the chace; and the &s;pear of Fingal was red in the blood of Gormal.</P>
<P>IT was then the daughter of Starno, with blue eyes rolling in tears, came with her voice of love and &s;poke to the king of Morven.</P>
<P>FINGAL, high-de&s;cended chief, tru&s;t not Starno's heart of pride. Within that wood he has placed his chiefs; beware of the wood of death. But, remember, &s;on of the hill, remember Agan|decca: &s;ave me from the wrath of my father, king of the windy Morven!</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="67">
THE youth, with unconcern, went on; his heroes by his &s;ide. The &s;ons of death fell by his hand; and Gormal ecchoed around.</P>
<P>BEFORE the halls of Starno the &s;ons of the chace convened. The king's dark brows were like clouds. His eyes like meteors of night. Bring hither, he cries, Agandecca to her lovely king of Morven. His hand is &s;tained with the blood of my people; and her words have not been in vain.&mdash;</P>
<P>SHE came with the red eye of tears. She came with her loo&s;e raven locks. Her white brea&s;t heaved with &s;ighs, like the foam of the &s;treamy Lubar. Starno pierced her &s;ide with &s;teel. She fell like a wreath of &s;now that &s;lides from the rocks of Ronan; when the woods are &s;till, and the eccho deepens in the vale.</P>
<P>THEN Fingal eyed his valiant chiefs, his valiant chiefs took arms. The gloom of the battle roared, and Lochlin fled or died.&mdash;Pale, in his bounding &s;hip he clo&s;ed the maid of the raven hair. Her tomb a&s;cends on Ardven, and the &s;ea roars round the dark dwelling of Agandecca.</P>

<P>SUCH were the words of Cuchullin at the &s;ound of the mountain-&s;tream, when Calmar a&s;cended the hill, the wounded &s;on of Matha. From the field he came in his blood. He leaned on his bending &s;pear. Feeble is the arm of battle! but &s;trong the &s;oul of the hero!</P>
<P>WELCOME! O &s;on of Matha, &s;aid Connal, welcome art thou to thy friends! Why bur&s;ts that broken &s;igh from the brea&s;t of him that never feared before?</P>
<P>AND never, Connal, will he fear, chief of the pointed &s;teel. My &s;oul brightens in danger, and exults in the noi&s;e of battle. I am of the race of &s;teel; my fathers never feared.</P>
<P>CORMAR was the fir&s;t of my race. He &s;ported through the &s;torms of the waves. His black &s;kiff bounded on ocean, and travel|led on the wings of the bla&s;t. A &s;pirit once embroiled the night. Seas &s;well and rocks re&s;ound. Winds drive along the clouds. The lightning flies on wings of fire. He feared and came to land: then blu&s;hed that he feared at all. He ru&s;hed again among the waves to find the &s;on of the wind. Three youths guide the bounding bark; he &s;tood with the &s;word un&s;heathed. When the low-hung vapour pa&s;&s;ed, he took it by the curling head, and &s;earched its dark womb with his &s;teel. The &s;on of the wind for&s;ook the air. The moon and &s;tars returned.</P>
<P>SUCH was the boldne&s;s of my race; and Calmar is like his fa|thers. Danger flies from the uplifted &s;word. They be&s;t &s;ucceed who dare.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="69">
BUT now, ye &s;ons of green-vallyed Erin, retire from Lena's bloody heath. Collect the &s;ad remnant of our friends, and join the &s;word of Fingal. I heard the &s;ound of Lochlin's advancing arms; but Calmar will remain and fight. My voice &s;hall be &s;uch, my friends, as if thou&s;ands were behind me. But, &s;on of Semo, re|member me. Remember Calmar's lifele&s;s cor&s;e. After Fingal has wa&s;ted the field, place me by &s;ome &s;tone of remembrance, that fu|ture times may hear my fame; and the mother of Calmar rejoice over the &s;tone of my renown.</P>
<P>No: &s;on of Matha, &s;aid Cuchullin, I will never leave thee. My joy is in the unequal field: and my &s;oul increa&s;es in danger. Connal, and Carril of other times, carry off the &s;ad &s;ons of Erin; and when the battle is over, &s;earch for our pale cor&s;es in this narrow way.

Its head is covered with foam, and the hills are ecchoing around.&mdash;Now from the gray mi&s;t of the ocean, the white-&s;ailed &s;hips of Fingal appear. High is the grove of their ma&s;ts as they nod, by turns, on the rolling wave.</P>
<P>SWARAN &s;aw them from the hill, and returned from the &s;ons of Erin.

But bending, weeping, &s;ad, and &s;low, and dragging his long &s;pear behind, Cuchullin &s;unk in Crom|la's wood, and mourned his fallen friends.

<P>HOW many lie there of my heroes! the chiefs of Inisfail! they that were chearful in the hall when the &s;ound of the &s;hells aro&s;e. No more &s;hall I find their &s;teps in the heath, or hear their voice in the chace of the hinds. Pale, &s;ilent, low on bloody beds are they who were my friends! O &s;pirits of the lately-dead, meet Cuchullin on his heath. Conver&s;e with him on the wind, when the ru&s;tling tree of Tura's cave re&s;ounds. There, far remote, I &s;hall lie un|known. No bard &s;hall hear of me. No gray &s;tone &s;hall ri&s;e to my renown. Mourn me with the dead, O Bragela! departed is my fame.</P>
<P>SUCH were the words of Cuchullin when he &s;unk in the woods of Cromla.</P>
<P>FINGAL, tall in his &s;hip, &s;tretched his bright lance before him. Terrible was the gleam of the &s;teel: it was like the green meteor of death, &s;etting in the heath of Malmor, when the traveller is alone, and the broad moon is darkened in heaven.</P>

THE battle is over, &s;aid the king, and I behold the blood of my friends.

<P>FAIR Ryno flew like lightning; dark Fillan as the &s;hade of au|tumn. On Lena's heath their voice is heard; the &s;ons of ocean heard the horn of Fingal's war. As the roaring eddy of ocean re|turning from the kingdom of &s;nows; &s;o &s;trong, &s;o dark, &s;o &s;udden came down the &s;ons of Lochlin. The king in their front appears in the di&s;mal pride of his arms. Wrath burns in his dark-brown face: and his eyes roll in the fire of his valour.</P>
<P>FINGAL beheld the &s;on of Starno; and he remembered Agan|decca.&mdash;For Swaran with the tears of youth had mourned his white-bo&s;omed &s;i&s;ter. He &s;ent Ullin of the &s;ongs to bid him to the fea&s;t of &s;hells. For plea&s;ant on Fingal's &s;oul returned the remem|brance of the fir&s;t of his loves.</P>

<P>WHO can relate the deaths of the people; or the deeds of mighty heroes; when Fingal, burning in his wrath, con&s;umed the &s;ons of Lochlin? Groans &s;welled on groans from hill to hill, till night had covered all. Pale, &s;taring like a herd of deer, the &s;ons of Lochlin convene on Lena. We &s;at and heard the &s;prightly harp at Lubar's gentle &s;tream. Fingal him&s;elf was next to the foe; and li&s;tened to the tales of bards. His godlike race were in the &s;ong, the chiefs of other times. Attentive, leaning on his &s;hield, the king of Morven &s;at. The wind whi&s;tled through his aged locks, and his thoughts are of the days of other years. Near him on his bending &s;pear, my young, my lovely O&s;car &s;tood.

<P>To thee I fly, with &s;ighs &s;he replied, O prince of mighty men! To thee I fly, chief of the generous &s;hells, &s;upporter of the feeble hand! The king of Craca's ecchoing i&s;le owned me the &s;un-beam of his race. And often did the hills of Cromala reply to the &s;ighs of love for the unhappy Faina&s;&oacute;llis. Sora's chief beheld me fair; and loved the daughter of Craca. His &s;word is like a beam of light upon the warrior's &s;ide. But dark is his brow; and tempe&s;ts are in his &s;oul.

<P>EIGHT were the heroes of O&s;&s;ian; Ullin &s;tormy &s;on of war; Mullo of the generous deeds; the noble, the graceful Scelacha; Oglan, and Cerdal the wrathful, and Dumariccan's brows of death. And why &s;hould Ogar be the la&s;t; &s;o wide renowned on the hills of Ardven?</P>
<P>OGAR met Dala the &s;trong, face to face, on the field of heroes. The battle of the chiefs was like the wind on ocean's foamy waves.
<PB N="51" REF="80">
The dagger is remembered by Ogar; the weapon which he loved; nine times he drowned it in Dela's &s;ide. The &s;tormy battle turned. Three times I broke on Cormac's &s;hield: three times he broke his &s;pear. But, unhappy youth of love! I cut his head away.&mdash;Five times I &s;hook it by the lock. The friends of Cormac fled.</P>

<HEAD>BOOK V<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The fourth day &s;till continues.

The be|ginning of this book, in the original, is one of the mo&s;t beautiful parts of the poem.

And renowned art thou, O warrior! many were the deaths of thy &s;teel. Often has Bragela met with blue-rolling eyes of joy; often has &s;he met her hero, returning in the mid&s;t of the valiant; when his &s;word was red with &s;laughter, and his foes &s;ilent in the fields of the tomb.

<P>NOW when the fourth gray morn aro&s;e, the hero launched his &s;hip; and walking along the &s;ilent &s;hore waited for the ru&s;hing wind. For loud and di&s;tant he heard the bla&s;t murmuring in the grove.</P>
<P>COVERED over with arms of &s;teel a &s;on of the woody Gormal appeared. Red was his cheek and fair his hair. His &s;kin like the &s;now of Morven. Mild rolled his blue and &s;miling eye when he &s;poke to the king of &s;words.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="105">
STAY, Trenmor, &s;tay thou fir&s;t of men, thou ha&s;t not conquered Lonval's &s;on. My &s;word has often met the brave. And the wi&s;e &s;hun the &s;trength of my bow.</P>
<P>THOU fair-haired youth, Trenmor replied, I will not fight with Lonval's &s;on. Thine arm is feeble, &s;un-beam of beauty. Retire to Gormal's dark-brown hinds.</P>
<P>BUT I will retire, replied the youth, with the &s;word of Tren|mor; and exult in the &s;ound of my fame. The virgins &s;hall gather with &s;miles around him who conquered Trenmor. They &s;hall &s;igh with the &s;ighs of love, and admire the length of thy &s;pear; when I &s;hall carry it among thou&s;ands, and lift the glittering point to the &s;un.</P>
<P>THOU &s;halt never carry my &s;pear, &s;aid the angry king of Mor|ven.&mdash;Thy mother &s;hall find thee pale on the &s;hore of the eccho|ing Gormal; and, looking over the dark-blue deep, &s;ee the fails of him that &s;lew her &s;on.</P>
<P>I WILL not lift the &s;pear, replied the youth, my arm is not &s;trong with years. But with the feathered dart, I have learned to pierce a di&s;tant foe. Throw down that heavy mail of &s;teel; for Trenmor is covered all over.&mdash;I fir&s;t, will lay my mail on earth.&mdash;Throw now thy dart, thou king of Morven.</P>
<P>HE &s;aw the heaving of her brea&s;t. It was the &s;i&s;ter of the king.&mdash;She had &s;een him in the halls of Gormal; and loved his face of youth.&mdash;The &s;pear dropt from the hand of Trenmor: he bent his red cheek to the ground, for he had &s;een her like a beam of light

<P>CHIEF of the windy Morven, begun the maid of the arms of &s;now; let me re&s;t in thy bounding &s;hip, far from the love of Corlo. For he, like the thunder of the de&s;art, is terrible to Inibaca. He loves me in the gloom of his pride, and &s;hakes ten thou&s;and &s;pears.</P>
<P>REST thou in peace, &s;aid the mighty Trenmor, behind the &s;hield of my fathers. I will not fly from the chief, though he &s;hakes ten thou&s;and &s;pears.</P>
<P>THREE days he waited on the &s;hore; and &s;ent his horn abroad. He called Corlo to battle from all his ecchoing hills. But Corlo came not to battle. The king of Lochlin de&s;cended. He fea&s;ted on the roaring &s;hore; and gave the maid to Trenmor.</P>
<P>KING of Lochlin, &s;aid Fingal, thy blood flows in the veins of thy foe. Our families met in battle, becau&s;e they loved the &s;trife of &s;pears. But often did they fea&s;t in the hall; and &s;end round the joy of the &s;hell.&mdash;Let thy face brighten with gladne&s;s, and thine far delight in the harp. Dreadful as the &s;torm of thine ocean, thou ha&s;t poured thy valour forth; thy voice has been like the voice of thou&s;ands when they engage in battle. Rai&s;e, to-morrow, thy white &s;ails to the wind, thou brother of Agandecca. Bright as the beam of noon &s;he comes on my mournful &s;oul. I have &s;een thy tears for the fair one, and &s;pared thee in the halls of Starno; when my &s;word was red with &s;laughter, and my eye full of tears for the maid.&mdash;Or do&s;t thou chu&s;e the fight? The combat which thy fathers gave to Trenmor is thine: that thou maye&s;t depart renown|ed like the &s;un &s;etting in the we&s;t.</P>

KING of the race of Morven, &s;aid the chief of the waves of Lochlin; never will Swaran fight with thee, fir&s;t of a thou&s;and heroes!

<P>NOR &s;hip, replied the king, &s;hall Fingal take, nor land of many hills. The de&s;art is enough to me with all its deer and woods. Ri&s;e on thy waves again, thou noble friend of Agandecca. Spread thy white &s;ails to the beam of the morning, and return to the ecchoing hills of Gormal.</P>
<P>BLEST be thy &s;oul, thou king of &s;hells, &s;aid Swaran of the dark-brown &s;hield. In peace thou art the gale of &s;pring. In war the mountain-&s;torm. Take now my hand in friend&s;hip, thou noble king of Morven.</P>

<P>SWARAN, &s;aid the king of the hills, to-day our fame is greate&s;t. We &s;hall pa&s;s away like a dream. No &s;ound will be in the fields of our battles. Our tombs will be lo&s;t in the heath. The hunter &s;hall not know the place of our re&s;t. Our names may be heard in the &s;ong, but the &s;trength of our arms will cea&s;e.</P>
<P>O OSSRAN, Carril, and Ullin, you know of heroes that are no more. Give us the &s;ong of other years. Let the night pa&s;s away on the &s;ound, and morning return with joy.</P>
<P>WE gave the &s;ong to the kings, and a hundred harps accom|panied our voice. The face of Swaran brightened like the full moon of heaven, when the clouds vani&s;h away, and leave her calm and broad in the mid&s;t of the &s;ky.</P>
<P>IT was then that Fingal &s;poke to Carril the chief of other times. Where is the &s;on of Semo; the king of the i&s;le of mi&s;t? has he re|tired, like the meteor of death, to the dreary cave of Tura?</P>
<P>CUCHULLIN, &s;aid Carril of other times, lies in the dreary cave of Tura. His hand is on the &s;word of his &s;trength. His thoughts on the battles which he lo&s;t. Mournful is the king of &s;pears, for he has often been victorious. He &s;ends the &s;word of his war to re&s;t on the &s;ide of Fingal. For, like the &s;torm of the de&s;art, thou ha&s;t &s;cattered all his foes. Take, O Fingal, the &s;word of the hero; for his fame is departed like mi&s;t when it flies before the ru&s;tling wind of the vale.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="109">
NO: replied the king, Fingal &s;hall never take his &s;word. His arm is mighty in war; and tell him his fame &s;hall never fail. Many have been overcome in battle, that have &s;hone afterwards like the &s;un of heaven.</P>
<P>O SWARAN, king of the re&s;ounding woods, give all thy grief away.&mdash;The vanqui&s;hed, if brave, are renowned; they are like the &s;un in a cloud when he hides his face in the &s;outh, but looks again on the hills of gra&s;s.</P>
<P>GRUMAL was a chief of Cona. He &s;ought the battle on every coa&s;t. His &s;oul rejoiced in blood; his ear in the din of arms.

<P>FIERCE was the battle of the heroes, for the maid of the brea&s;t of &s;now. The fame of the daughter of Craca had reached Grumal at the &s;treams of Cona; he vowed to have the white-bo&s;omed maid, or die on the ecchoing Craca. Three days they &s;trove together, and Grumal on the fourth was bound.</P>
<P>FAR from his friends they placed him in the horrid circle of Brumo; where often, they &s;aid, the gho&s;ts of the dead howled round the &s;tone of their fear. But afterwards he &s;hone like a pillar of the light of heaven. They fell by his mighty hand, and Grumal had his fame.</P>

<P>WHEN now &s;hall I hear the bard; or rejoice at the fame of my fathers? The harp is not &s;trung on Morven; nor the voice of mu&s;ic rai&s;ed on Cona. Dead with the mighty is the bard; and fame is in the de&s;art no more.</P>
<P>MORNING trembles with the beam of the ca&s;t, and glimmers on gray-headed Cromla.

<P>ONE deer fell at the tomb of Ryno; and the grief of Fingal re|turned.

He was in love with Cuth&oacute;na the daughter of Rumar, when To&s;car the &s;on of Kin|fena, accompanied by Fercuth his friend, arrived, from Ireland, at Mora where Conlath dwelt.

In the mean-time Conlath, hearing of the rape, &s;ailed after him, and found him on the point of &s;ailing for the coa&s;t of Ireland.

<HEAD>CARTHON<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This poem is compleat, and the &s;ub|ject of it, as of mo&s;t of O&s;&s;ian's compo&s;i|tions, tragical. In the time of Comhal the &s;on of Trathal, and father of the cele|brated Fingal, Cle&s;s&aacute;mmor the &s;on of Thaddu and brother of Morna, Fingal's mother, was driven by a &s;torm into the river Clyde, on the banks of which &s;tood Balclutha, a town belonging to the Bri|tons between the walls. He was ho&s;pitably received by Reuth&aacute;mir, the principal man in the place, who gave him Moina his only daughter in marriage. Reuda, the &s;on of Cormo, a Briton who was in love with Moina, came to Reuthamir's hou&s;e, and behaved haughtily towards Cle&s;s&aacute;mmor. A quarrel in&s;ued, in which Reuda was killed; the Britons, who attended him pre&s;&s;ed &s;o hard on Cle&s;s&aacute;mmor, that he was obliged to throw him&s;elf into the Clyde, and &s;wim to his &s;hip. He hoi&s;ted &s;ail, and the wind being favourable, bore him out to &s;ea. He often endeavoured to return, and carry off his beloved Moina by night; but the wind continuing contrary, he was forced to de&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>Moina, who had been left with child by her hu&s;band, brought forth a &s;on, and died &s;oon after.&mdash;Reuthamir named the child Carthon, <HI>i. e. the murmur of waves,</HI> from the &s;torm which carried off Cle&s;s&aacute;mmor his father, who was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been ca&s;t away. When Carthon was three years old, Comhal the father of Fingal, in one of his expeditions again&s;t the Britons, took and burnt Balclutha. Reuth&aacute;mir was kil|led in the attack: and Carthon was carried &s;afe away by his nur&s;e, who fled farther into the country of the Britons. Carthon, coming to man's e&s;tate was re&s;olved to re|venge the fall of Balclutha on Comhal's po&s;terity. He &s;et &s;ail, from the Clyde, and, falling on the coa&s;t of Morven, de|feated two of Fingal's heroes, who came to oppo&s;e his progre&s;s. He was, at la&s;t, un|wittingly killed by his father Cle&s;s&aacute;mmor, in a &s;ingle combat. This &s;tory is the foundation of the pre&s;ent poem, which opens on the night preceding the death of Carthon, &s;o that what pa&s;&s;ed before is in|troduced by way of epi&s;ode. The poem is addre&s;&s;ed to Malvina the daughter of To&s;|car.</P></NOTE>: A POEM.</HEAD>
<P>A TALE of the times of old! The deeds of days of other years!&mdash;The murmur of thy &s;treams, O Lora, brings back the memory of the pa&s;t. The &s;ound of thy woods, Garmallar, is lovely in mine ear. Do&s;t thou not behold, Malvina, a rock with its head of heath?

<HEAD>THE DEATH of CUCHULLIN: A POEM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Tradition throws con&s;iderable light on the hi&s;tory of Ireland, during the long reign of Fingal, the &s;on of Comhal, in Morven.&mdash;Arth, the &s;on of Cairbre, &s;upreme king of Ireland, dying, was &s;ucceeded by his &s;on Cormac, a minor.&mdash;The petty kings and chiefs of the tribes met at Temora, the royal palace, in order to chu&s;e, out of their own number, a guardian to the young king. Di&s;putes, concerning the choice of a proper per&s;on, run high, and it was re&s;olved to end all differences by giving the tuition of the young king to Cuchullin, the &s;on of Semo, who had rendered him&s;elf famous by his great actions, and who re&s;ided, at the time, with Connal, the &s;on of Caithbat, in Ul&s;ter.</P>
<P>Cuchullin was but three and twenty years old, when he a&s;&s;umed the management of affairs in Ireland: and the inva&s;ion of Swa|ran happened two years after. In the twen|ty-&s;eventh year of Cuchullin's age, and the third of his admini&s;tration, Torlath, the &s;on of Cant&eacute;la, &s;et up for him&s;elf in Con|naught, and advanced towards Temora, in order to dethrone Cormac. Cuchullin marched again&s;t him, came up with him at the Lake of Lego, and totally defeated his forces. Torlath fell in the battle by Cuchullin's hand; but as he him&s;elf pre&s;&s;ed too eagerly on the flying enemy, he was mortally wounded by an arrow, and died the &s;econd day after.</P>
<P>The good fortune of Cormac fell with Cuchullin: many &s;et up for them&s;elves, and anarchy and confu&s;ion reigned. At la&s;t Cormac was taken off, nobody knew how; and Cairbar, one of the competitors for the throne, having defeated all his ri|vals, became &s;ole monarch of Ireland.&mdash;The family of Fingal, who were in the in|tere&s;t of Cormac's family, were re&s;olved to deprive Cairbar of the throne he had u&s;urped; in particular, O&s;car the &s;on of Offian had determined to revenge the death of Cathol, his friend, who had been a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inated by Cairbar.&mdash;The threats of O&s;car reached Cairbar's ears: he invited him in a friendly manner to a fea&s;t which he had prepared at the royal palace of Temora, re&s;olving to pick a quarrel, and have &s;ome pretext for killing him.</P>
<P>The quarrel happened; the followers of both fought, and Cairbar and O&s;car &s;ell by mutual wounds: in the mean time Fingal arrived from Scotland with an army, de|feated the friends of Cairbar, and re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hed the family of Cormac in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the kingdom.&mdash;The pre&s;ent poem concerns the death of Cuchullin. It is, in the original, called <HI>Duan loch Leigo, i. e. The Poem of Lego's Lake,</HI> and is an epi&s;ode introduced in a great poem, which celebrated the la&s;t expedition of Fingal into Ireland. The greate&s;t part of the poem is lo&s;t, and nothing remains but &s;ome epi|&s;odes, which a few old people in the north of Scotland retain on memory.&mdash;Cuchul|lin is the mo&s;t famous Champion in the Iri&s;h traditions and poems; in them he is always called the <HI>redoubtable Cuchullin;</HI> and the fables concerning his &s;trength and va|lour are innumerable. O&s;&s;ian thought his expedition again&s;t the Fir-bolg, or Belgae of Britain, a &s;ubject fit for an epic poem; which was extant till of late, and was called <HI>Tora-na-tana,</HI> or a <HI>Di&s;pute about Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions,</HI> as the war which was the founda|tion of it, was commenced by the Briti&s;h Belgae, who inhabited Ireland, in order to extend their territories.&mdash;The fragments that remain of this poem are animated with the genuine &s;pirit of O&s;&s;ian; &s;o that there can be do doubt that it was of his compo&s;ition.</P></NOTE>.</HEAD>

<HEAD>DAR-THULA: A POEM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It may not be improper here, to give the &s;tory which is the foundation of this poem, as it is handed down by tradition.&mdash;U&s;noth lord of Etha, which is probably that part of Argyle&s;hire which is near Loch Eta, an arm of the &s;ea in Lorn, had three &s;ons, Nathos, Althos, and Ardan by Slis-s&aacute;ma, the daughter of Semo and &s;i&s;ter to the celebrated Cuchullin. The three brothers, when very young, were &s;ent over to Ireland, by their father, to learn the u&s;e of arms, un|der their uncle Cuchullin, who made a great figure in that kingdom. They were ju&s;t landed in Ul&s;ter when the news of Cu|chullin's death arrived. Nathos, though very young, took the command of Cu|chullin's army, made head again&s;t Cairbar the u&s;urper, and defeated him in &s;everal battles. Cairbar at la&s;t having found means to murder Cormac the lawful king, the ar|my of Nathos &s;hifted &s;ides, and he him&s;elf was obliged to return into Ul&s;ter, in order to pa&s;s over into Scotland.</P>
<P>Dar-thula, the daughter of Colla, with whom Cairbar was in love, re&s;ided, at that time, in Selama a ca&s;tle in Ul&s;ter: &s;he &s;aw, fell in love, and fled with Nathos; but a &s;torm ri&s;ing at &s;ea, they were unfortunately driven back on that part of the coa&s;t of Ul|&s;ter, where Cairbar was encamped with his army. The three brothers, after having de|fended them&s;elves, for &s;ome time, with great bravery, were overpowered and &s;lain, and the unfortunate Dar-thula killed her&s;elf up|on the body of her beloved Nathos.</P>
<P>O&s;&s;ian opens the poem, on the night pre|ceding the death of the &s;ons of U&s;noth, and brings in, by way of epi&s;ode, what pa&s;&s;ed before. He relates the death of Dar-thula differently from the common tradition; his account is the mo&s;t probable, as &s;uicide &s;eems to have been unknown in tho&s;e early times: for no traces of it are found in the old poetry.</P></NOTE>.</HEAD>

<BIBL>HOM. vi. 411.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>, but Nathos? My father re&s;ts in the tomb. Silence dwells on Sel&aacute;ma: &s;adne&s;s &s;preads on the blue &s;treams of my land. My friends have fallen, with Cormac. The mighty were &s;lain in the battle of Ullin.</P>
<P>EVENING darkened on the plain. The blue &s;treams failed before mine eyes. The unfrequent bla&s;t came ru&s;tling in the tops of Sel&aacute;ma's groves. My feat was beneath a tree on the walls of my fathers. Truthil pa&s;t before my &s;oul; the brother of my love; he that was ab&s;ent<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The family of Colla pre&s;erved their loyalty to Cormac long after the death of Cuchullin.</NOTE> in battle again&s;t the car-borne Cairbar.</P>
<P>BENDING on his &s;pear, the gray-haired Colla came: his down-ca&s;t face is dark, and &s;orrow dwells in his &s;oul. His &s;word is on the &s;ide of the hero: the helmet of his fathers on his head.&mdash;The battle grows in his brea&s;t. He &s;trives to hide the tear.</P>
<P>DAR-THULA, he &s;ighing &s;aid, thou art the la&s;t of Colla's race. Truthil is fallen in battle. The king<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is very common, in O&s;&s;ian's poetry, to give the title of King to every chief that was remarkable for his valour.</NOTE> of Sel&aacute;ma is no more.&mdash;Cairbar comes, with his thou&s;ands, towards Sel&aacute;ma's walls.&mdash;Colla will meet his pride, and revenge his &s;on. But where &s;hall I find thy &s;afety, Dar-thula with the dark-brown hair! thou art lovely as the &s;un-beam of heaven, and thy friends are low!</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="189">
AND is the &s;on of battle fallen, I &s;aid with a bur&s;ting &s;igh? Cea&s;ed the generous &s;oul of Truthil to lighten through the field?&mdash;My &s;afety, Colla, is in that bow; I have learned to pierce the deer. Is not Cairbar like the hart of the de&s;art, father of fallen Truthil?</P>
<P>THE face of age brightened with joy: and the crouded tears of his eyes poured down. The lips of Colla trembled. His gray beard whi&s;tled in the bla&s;t. Thou art the &s;i&s;ter of Truthil, he &s;aid, and thou burne&s;t in the fire of his &s;oul. Take, Dar-thula, take that &s;pear, that brazen &s;hield, that burni&s;hed helmet: they are the &s;poils of a warrior: a &s;on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The poet, to make the &s;tory of Dar-thula's arming her&s;elf for battle, more pro|bable, makes her armour to be that of a very young man, otherwi&s;e it would &s;hock all belief, that &s;he, who was very young, &s;hould be able to carry it.</NOTE> of early youth.&mdash;When the light ri&s;es on Sel&aacute;ma, we go to meet the car-borne Cairbar.&mdash;But keep thou near the arm of Colla; beneath the &s;hadow of my &s;hield. Thy father, Darthula, could once defend thee; but age is trembling on his hand.&mdash;The &s;trength of his arm has failed, and his &s;oul is darkened with grief.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed the night in &s;orrow. The light of morning ro&s;e. I &s;hone in the arms of battle. The gray-haired hero moved be|fore. The &s;ons of Sel&aacute;ma convened around the &s;ounding &s;hield of Colla. But few were they in the plain, and their locks were gray. The youths had fallen with Truthil, in the battle of car-borne Cormac.</P>
<P>COMPANIONS of my youth! &s;aid Colla, it was not thus you have &s;een me in arms. It was not thus I &s;trode to battle, when the great Confadan fell. But ye are laden with grief. The darkne&s;s

I &s;aid to my &s;oul, thy evening &s;hall be calm, and thy departure like a fading light. But the &s;torm has returned; I bend like an aged oak. My boughs are fallen on Sel&aacute;ma, and I tremble in my place.&mdash;Where art thou, with thy fallen heroes, O my car-borne Truthil! Thou an&s;were&s;t not from thy ru&s;hing bla&s;t; and the &s;oul of thy father is &s;ad. But I will be &s;ad no more, Cairbar or Colla mu&s;t fall. I feel the re|turning &s;trength of my arm. My heart leaps at the &s;ound of battle.</P>
<P>THE hero drew his &s;word. The gleaming blades of his people ro&s;e. They moved along the plain. Their gray hair &s;treamed in the wind.&mdash;Cairbar &s;at, at the fea&s;t, in the &s;ilent plain of Lona<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lona, <HI>a mar&s;hy plain.</HI> It was the cu|&s;tom, in the days of O&s;&s;ian, to fea&s;t after a victory.

He &s;aw the coming of the heroes, and he called his chiefs to battle.</P>
<P>WHY<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The poet, by an artifice, avoids the de&s;cription of the battle of Lona, as it would be improper in the mouth of a wo|man, and could have nothing new, after the numerous de&s;criptions, of that kind, in his other poems.

I have &s;een thee, in the mid&s;t of thou&s;ands, like the beam of hea|ven's fire; it is beautiful, but terrible; the people fall in its red cour&s;e.&mdash;The &s;pear of Colla &s;lew, for he remembered the battles of his youth. An arrow came with its &s;ound, and pierced the he|ro's &s;ide. He fell on his ecchoing &s;hield. My &s;oul &s;tarted with

Cairbar came, with his &s;pear, and he beheld Sel&aacute;ma's maid: joy ro&s;e on his dark-brown face; he &s;tayed the lifted &s;teel. He rai&s;|ed the tomb of Colla; and brought me weeping to Sel&aacute;ma. He &s;poke the words of love, but my &s;oul was &s;ad. I &s;aw the &s;hields of my fathers, and the &s;word of car-borne Truthil. I &s;aw the arms of the dead, and the tear was on my cheek.</P>
<P>THEN thou did&s;t come, O Nathos: and gloomy Cairbar fled. He fled like the gho&s;t of the de&s;art before the morning's beam. His ho&s;ts were not near: and feeble was his arm again&s;t thy &s;teel.</P>
<P>WHY<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is u&s;ual with O&s;&s;ian, to repeat, at the end of the epi&s;odes, the &s;entence which in|troduced them. It brings back the mind of the reader to the main &s;tory of the poem.</NOTE> art thou &s;ad, O Nathos! &s;aid the lovely maid of Colla?</P>
<P>I HAVE met, replied the hero, the battle in my youth. My arm could not lift the &s;pear, when fir&s;t the danger ro&s;e; but my &s;oul brightened before the war, as the green narrow vale, when the &s;un pours his &s;treamy beams, before he hides his head in a &s;torm. My &s;oul brightened in danger before I &s;aw Sel&aacute;ma's fair; before I &s;aw thee, like a &s;tar, that &s;hines on the hill, at night; the cloud &s;lowly comes, and threatens the lovely light.</P>
<P>WE are in the land of the foe, and the winds have deceived us, Dar-thula! the &s;trength of our friends is not near, nor the moun|tains of Etha. Where &s;hall I find thy peace, daughter of mighty Colla! The brothers of Nathos are brave: and his own &s;word has &s;hone in war.

<P>AND they will prevail, O Nathos, &s;aid the ri&s;ing &s;oul of the maid: never &s;hall Dar-thula behold the halls of gloomy Cairbar. Give me tho&s;e arms of bra&s;s, that glitter to that pa&s;&s;ing meteor; I &s;ee them in the dark-bo&s;omed &s;hip.

<P>JOY ro&s;e in the face of Nathos, when he heard the white bo&s;omed maid. Daughter of Sel&aacute;ma! thou &s;hine&s;t on my &s;oul. Come, with thy thou&s;ands, Cairbar! the &s;trength of Nathos is returned. And thou, O aged U&s;noth, &s;halt not hear that thy &s;on has fled.

His words may come to U&s;noth, and &s;adden his &s;oul in the hall.&mdash;The tear is on his cheek. He gave this &s;hin|ing &s;word.</P>
<P>I came to Tura's bay: but the halls of Tura were &s;ilent; I looked around, and there was none to tell of the chief of Dun&s;caich. I

<P>HE fell not, Lamhor replied, like the &s;ilent &s;tar of night, when it &s;hoots through darkne&s;s and is no more.

<P>SADNESS &s;eized the &s;ons of Ullin, they &s;lowly, gloomily retired: like clouds that, long having threatened rain, retire behind the hills.

<P>SUCH was my &s;ong, in Selma, to the lightly-trembling harp. But Nathos was on Ullin's &s;hore, &s;urrounded by the night; he heard the voice of the foe amid&s;t the roar of tumbling waves. Silent he heard their voice, and re&s;ted on his &s;pear.</P>

<P>THEN Cairbar ordered his people, and they drew a thou&s;and bows. A thou&s;and arrows flew; the &s;ons of U&s;noth fell.

<HEAD>TEMORA: AN EPIC POEM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Though the hi&s;tory which is the foun|dation of the pre&s;ent poem, was given in the notes on the two pieces preceding, it may not be here improper to recapitulate &s;ome part of what has been &s;aid.&mdash;Imme|diately after the death of Cuchullin, Cair|bar, lord of Atha, openly &s;et up for him|&s;elf in Connaught, and having privately murdered young king Cormac, became, without oppo&s;ition, &s;ole monarch of Ire|land. The murder of Cormac was &s;o much re&s;ented by Fingal, that he re&s;olved on an expedition into Ireland again&s;t Cair|bar. Early intelligence of his de&s;igns came to Cairbar, and he had gathered the tribes together into Ul&s;ter, to oppo&s;e Fingal's landing; at the &s;ame time his brother Cathmor kept him&s;elf with an army near Temora.&mdash;This Cathmor is one of the fine&s;t characters in the old poetry. His humanity, genero&s;ity, and ho&s;pitality, were unparallelled: in &s;hort, he had no fault, but too much attachment to &s;o bad a brother as Cairbar.&mdash;The pre&s;ent poem has its name from Temora, the royal palace of the Iri&s;h kings, near which the la&s;t and de|ci&s;ive battle was fought between Fingal and Cathmor. What has come to the tran&s;lator's hands, in a regular connection, is little more than the opening of the poem.&mdash;This work appears, from the &s;tory of it, which is &s;till pre&s;erv'd, to have been one of the greate&s;t of O&s;&s;ian's compo&s;itions. The variety of the characters makes it in|tere&s;ting; and the war, as it is carried on by Fingal and Cathmor, affords in&s;tances of the greate&s;t bravery, mixed with incom|parably generous actions and &s;entiments. One is at a lo&s;s for which &s;ide to declare him&s;elf: and often wi&s;hes, when both commanders march to battle, that both may return victorious. At length the good fortune of Fingal preponderates, and the family of Cormac are re-e&s;tabli&s;hed on the Iri&s;h throne.</P>
<P>The Iri&s;h traditions relate the affair in another light, and exclaim again&s;t Fingal for appointing thirty judges, or rather ty|rants, at Temora, for regulating the affairs of Ireland. They pretend to enumerate many acts of oppre&s;&s;ion committed by tho&s;e judges; and affirm, that both they and a part of Fingal's army, which was left in Ireland to enforce their laws, were at la&s;t expelled the kingdom.&mdash;Thus the Iri&s;h tra|ditions, &s;ay the hi&s;torians of that nation. It is &s;aid, however, that tho&s;e gentlemen &s;ometimes create facts, in order afterwards to make remarks upon them; at lea&s;t, that they adopt for real facts, the traditions of their bards, when they throw lu&s;tre on the ancient &s;tate of their country.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent poem opens in the morning. Cairbar is repre&s;ented as retired from the re&s;t of the Iri&s;h chiefs, and tormented with remor&s;e for the murder of Cormac, when news was brought him of Fingal's landing. What pa&s;&s;ed, preceding that day, and is nece&s;&s;ary to be known for carrying on the poem, is afterwards introduced by way of epi&s;ode.</P></NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>THE blue waves of Ullin roll in light. The green hills are covered with day. Trees &s;hake their du&s;ky heads in the breeze; and gray torrents pour their noi&s;y &s;treams.&mdash;Two green hills, with their aged oaks, &s;urround a narrow plain. The blue

Cormac ri&s;es in his &s;oul, with all his gha&s;tly wounds. The gray form of the youth appears in the mid&s;t of darkne&s;s, and the blood pours from his airy &s;ides.&mdash;Cairbar thrice threw his &s;pear on earth; and thrice he &s;troked his beard. His &s;teps are &s;hort; he often &s;topt: and to&s;&s;ed his &s;inewy arms. He is like a cloud in the de&s;art; that varies its form to every bla&s;t: the valleys are &s;ad around, and fear, by turns, the &s;hower.</P>
<P>THE king, at length, re&s;umed his &s;oul, and took his pointed &s;pear.

When the warrior returns from battles, and tells of other lands, he will &s;ay, I have &s;een a tomb, by the roaring &s;tream, where a warrior darkly dwells: he was &s;lain by car-borne O&s;car, the fir&s;t of mortal men.&mdash;I, perhaps, &s;hall hear him, and a beam of joy will ri&s;e in my &s;oul.</P>
<P>THE night would have de&s;cended in &s;orrow, and morning re|turned in the &s;hadow of grief: our chiefs would have &s;tood like cold dropping rocks on Lena, and have forgot the war, did not the king di&s;per&s;e his grief, and rai&s;e his mighty voice. The chiefs, as new-wakened from dreams, lift their heads around.</P>
<P>How long &s;hall we weep on Lena; or pour our tears in Ullin? The mighty will not return. O&s;car &s;hall not ri&s;e in his &s;trength. The valiant mu&s;t fall one day, and be no more known on his hills.&mdash;Where are our fathers, O warriors! the chiefs of the times of old? They have &s;et like &s;tars that have &s;tone, we only hear the &s;ound of their prai&s;e. But they were renowned in their day, and the terror of other times. Thus &s;hall we pa&s;s, O warriors, in the day of our fall. Then let us be renowned when we may; and leave our fame behind us, like the la&s;t beams of the &s;un, when he hides his red head in the we&s;t.</P>
<P>ULLIN, my aged bard! take the &s;hip of the king. Carry O&s;car to Selma, and let the daughters of Morven weep. We &s;hall fight in Erin for the race of fallen Cormac. The days of my years begin to fail: I feel the weakne&s;s of my arm. My fathers bend from

their clouds, to receive their gray-hair'd &s;on. But, Trenmor! be|fore I go hence, one beam of my fame &s;hall ri&s;e: &s;o &s;hall my days end, as my years begun, in fame: my life &s;hall be one &s;tream of light to other times.</P>
<P>ULLIN rais'd his white &s;ails: the wind of the &s;outh came forth. He bounded on the waves towards Selma's walls.&mdash;I remained in my grief, but my words were not heard.&mdash;The fea&s;t is &s;pread on Lena: an hundred heroes reared the tomb of Cairbar: but no &s;ong is rai&s;ed over the chief; for his &s;oul had been dark and bloody. We remembered the fall of Cormac! and what could we &s;ay in Cair|bar's prai&s;e?</P>
<P>THE night came rolling down. The light of an hundred oaks aro&s;e. Fingal &s;at beneath a tree. The chief of Etha &s;at near the king, the gray-hair'd &s;trength of U&s;noth.</P>
<P>OLD Althan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Althan, the &s;on of Conachar, was the chief bard of Arth king of Ireland. After the death of Arth, Althan attended his &s;on Cormac, and was pre&s;ent at his death.&mdash;He had made his e&s;cape from Cairbar, by the means of Cathmor, and coming to Fingal, related, as here, the death of his ma&s;ter Cormac.</NOTE> &s;tood in the mid&s;t, and told the tale of fallen Cormac.

<P>One of the Fragments of Ancient Poetry lately publi&s;hed, gives a different account of the death of O&s;car, the &s;on of O&s;&s;ian. The tran&s;lator, though he well knew the more probable tradition concerning that hero, was unwilling to reject a poem, which, if not really of O&s;&s;ian's compo&s;ition, has much of his manner, and conci&s;e turn of expre&s;&s;ion. A more correct copy of that fragment, which has &s;ince come to the tran&s;lator's hands, has enabled him to cor|rect the mi&s;take, into which a &s;imilarity of names had led tho&s;e who handed down the poem by tradition.&mdash;The heroes of the piece are O&s;car the &s;on of Caruth, and Dermid the &s;on of Diaran. O&s;&s;ian, or perhaps his imitator, opens the poem with a lamentation for O&s;car, and afterwards, by an ea&s;y tran&s;ition, relates the &s;tory of O&s;car the &s;on of Caruth, who &s;eems to have bore the &s;ame character, as well as name, with O&s;car the &s;on of O&s;&s;ian. Though the tran&s;lator thinks he has good rea&s;on to reject the fragment as the com|po&s;ition of O&s;&s;ian; yet as it is, after all, &s;till &s;omewhat doubtful whether it is or not, he has here &s;ubjoined it.</P>
<Q><P>WHY opene&s;t thou afre&s;h the &s;pring of my grief, O &s;on of Alpin, inquiring how O&s;car fell? My eyes are blind with tears; but memory beams on my heart. How can I relate the mournful death of the head of the people! Chief of the war|riors, O&s;car, my &s;on, &s;hall I &s;ee thee no more!</P>
<P>He fell as the moon in a &s;torm; as the &s;un from the mid&s;t of his cour&s;e, when clouds ri&s;e from the wa&s;te of the waves, when the blackne&s;s of the &s;torm inwraps the rocks of Ardannider. I, like an an|cient
oak on Morven, I moulder alone in my place. The bla&s;t hath lopped my branches away; and I tremble at the wings of the north. Chief of the war|riors, O&s;car, my &s;on! &s;hall I &s;ee thee no more!</P>
<P>But, &s;on of Alpin, the hero fell not harmle&s;s as the gra&s;s of the field; the blood of the mighty was on his &s;word, and he travelled with death through the ranks of their pride. But O&s;car, thou &s;on of Ca|ruth, thou ha&s;t fallen low! No enemy fell by thy hand. Thy &s;pear was &s;tained with the blood of thy friend.</P>
<P>Dermid and O&s;car were one: They reaped the battle together. Their friend|&s;hip was &s;trong as their &s;teel; and death walked between them to the field. They came on the foe like two rocks falling from the brows of Ardven. Their &s;words were &s;tained with the blood of the valiant: warriors fainted at their names. Who was equal to O&s;car, but Dermid? and who to Dermid, but O&s;car!</P>
<P>They killed mighty Dargo in the field; Dargo who never &s;led in war. His daugh|ter was fair as the morn; mild as the beam of night. Her eyes, like two &s;tars in a &s;hower: her breath, the gale of &s;pring: her brea&s;ts, as the new-fallen &s;now floating on the moving heath. The warriors &s;aw her, and loved; their &s;ouls were fixed on the maid. Each loved her as his fame; each mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s her or die. But her &s;oul was fixed on O&s;car; the &s;on of Caruth was the youth of her love. She forgot the blood of her father; and loved the hand that &s;lew him.</P>
<P>Son of Caruth, &s;aid Dermid, I love; O O&s;car, I love this maid. But her &s;oul cleaveth unto thee; and nothing can heal Dermid. Here, pierce this bo&s;om, O&s;car; relieve me, my friend, with thy &s;word.</P>
<P>My &s;word, &s;on of Diaran, &s;hall never be &s;tained with the blood of Dermid.</P>
<P>Who then is worthy to &s;lay me, O O&s;car &s;on of Caruth? Let not my life pa&s;s away unknown. Let none but O&s;car &s;lay me. Send me with honour to the grave, and let my death be renowned.</P>
<P>Dermid, make u&s;e of thy &s;word; &s;on of Diaran, wield thy &s;teel. Would that I fell with thee! that my death came from the hand of Dermid!</P>
<P>They fought by the brook of the moun|tain, by the &s;treams of Branno. Blood tinged the running water, and curdled round the mo&s;&s;y &s;tones. The &s;tately Der|mid fell; he fell, and &s;miled in death.</P>
<P>And falle&s;t thou, &s;on of Diaran, falle&s;t thou by O&s;car's hand! Dermid who ne|ver yielded in war, thus do I &s;ee thee fall!&mdash;He went, and returned to the maid of his love; he returned, but &s;he perceived his grief.</P>
<P>Why that gloom, &s;on of Caruth? what &s;hades thy mighty &s;oul?</P>
<P>Though once renowned for the bow, O maid, I have lo&s;t my &s;ame. Fixed on a tree by the brook of the hill, is the &s;hield of the valiant Gormur, whom I &s;lew in battle. I have wa&s;ted the day in vain, nor could my arrow pierce it.</P>
<P>Let me try, &s;on of Caruth, the &s;kill of Dargo's daughter. My hands were taught the bow: my father delighted in my &s;kill.</P>
<P>She went. He &s;tood behind the &s;hield. Her arrow flew, and pierced his brea&s;t.</P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ed be that hand of &s;now; and ble&s;|&s;ed that bow of yew! Who but the daughter of Dargo was worthy to &s;lay the &s;on of Caruth? Lay me in the earth, my fair one; lay me by the &s;ide of Dermid.</P>
<P>O&s;car! the maid replied, I have the &s;oul of the mighty Dargo. Well plea&s;ed I can meet death. My &s;orrow I can end.&mdash;She pierced her white bo&s;om with the &s;teel. She fell; &s;he trembled; and died.</P>
<P>By the brook of the hill their graves are laid; a birch's unequal &s;hade covers their tomb. Often on their green earthen tombs the branchy &s;ons of the mountain feed, when mid-day is all in flames, and &s;ilence over all the hills.</P></Q>

<HEAD>CARRIC-THURA: A POEM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fingal, returning from an expedition which he had made into the Roman pro|vince, re&s;olved to vi&s;it Cathulla king of Inis-tore, and brother to Com&aacute;la, who&s;e &s;tory is related, at large, in the dramatic poem, publi&s;hed in this collection. Upon his coming in &s;ight of Carric-thura, the pa|lace of Cathulla, he ob&s;erved a flame on its top, which, in tho&s;e days, was a &s;ignal of di&s;tre&s;s. The wind drove him into a bay, at &s;ome di&s;tance from Carric-thura, and he was obliged to pa&s;s the night on the &s;hore. Next day he attacked the army of Frothal king of Sora who had be&s;ieged Cathulla in his palace of Carric-thura, and took Frothal him&s;elf pri&s;oner, after he had engaged him in a &s;ingle combat. The de|liverance of Carric-thura is the &s;ubject of the poem, but &s;everal other epi&s;odes are interwoven with it. It appears from tra|dition, that this poem was addre&s;&s;ed to a Culdee, or one of the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian mi&s;&s;io|naries, and that the &s;tory of the <HI>Spirit of Loda,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed to be the ancient Odin of Scandinavia, was introduced by O&s;&s;ian in oppo&s;ition to the Culdee's doctrine. Be this as it will, it lets us into O&s;&s;ian's no|tions of a &s;uperior being; and &s;hews that he was not addicted to the &s;uper&s;tition which prevailed all the world over, before the introduction of Chri&s;tianity.</NOTE>.</HEAD>

<P>THEN give me tho&s;e arms of light; that &s;word, and that &s;pear of &s;teel. I &s;hall meet Dargo with thee, and aid my lovely Connal. Farewel, ye rocks of Ardven! ye deer! and ye &s;treams of the hill!&mdash;We &s;hall return no more. Our tombs are di&s;tant far.</P>

<P>AND did they return no more? &s;aid Utha's bur&s;ting &s;igh. Fell the mighty in battle, and did Crimora live?&mdash;Her &s;teps were lonely, and her &s;oul was &s;ad for Connal. Was he not young and lovely; like the beam of the &s;etting &s;un? Ullin &s;aw the virgin's tear, and took the &s;oftly-trembling harp: the &s;ong was lovely, but &s;ad, and &s;ilence was in Carric-thura.</P>
<P>AUTUMN is dark on the mountains; gray mi&s;t re&s;ts on the hills. The whirlwind is heard on the heath. Dark rolls the river through

the narrow plain. A tree &s;tands alone on the hill, and marks the &s;lumbering Connal. The leaves whirl round with the wind, and &s;trew the grave of the dead. At times are &s;een here the gho&s;ts of the decea&s;ed, when the mu&s;ing hunter alone &s;talks &s;lowly over the heath.</P>
<P>WHO can reach the &s;ource of thy race, O Connal? and who re|count thy fathers? Thy family grew like an oak on the mountain, which meeteth the wind with its lofty head. But now it is torn from the earth. Who &s;hall &s;upply the place of Connal?</P>
<P>HERE was the din of arms; and here the groans of the dying. Bloody are the wars of Fingal! O Connal! it was here thou did&s;t fall. Thine arm was like a &s;torm; thy &s;word a beam of the &s;ky; thy height, a rock on the plain; thine eyes, a furnace of fire. Louder than a &s;torm was thy voice, in the battles of thy &s;teel. Warriors fell by thy &s;word, as the thi&s;tle by the &s;taff of a boy.</P>
<P>DARGO the mighty came on, like a cloud of thunder. His brows were contracted and dark. His eyes like two caves in a rock. Bright ro&s;e their &s;words on each &s;ide; dire was the clang of their &s;teel.</P>
<P>THE daughter of Rinval was near; Crimora bright in the armour of man; her yellow hair is loo&s;e behind, her bow is in her hand. She followed the youth to the war, Connal her much-beloved. She drew the &s;tring on Dargo; but erring pierced her Connal. He falls like an oak on the plain; like a rock from the &s;haggy hill. What &s;hall &s;he do, haple&s;s maid!&mdash;He bleeds; her Connal dies. All the night long &s;he cries, and all the day, O Connal, my love, and my friend! With grief the &s;ad mourner dies.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="236">
EARTH here inclo&s;es the lovelie&s;t pair on the hill. The gra&s;s grows between the &s;tones of the tomb; I often &s;it in the mournful &s;hade.

<HEAD>THE SONGS of SELMA<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This poem fixes the antiquity of a cu&s;tom, which is well known to have pre|vailed afterwards, in the north of Scotland, and in Ireland. The bards, at an annual fea&s;t, provided by the king or chief, re|peated their poems, and &s;uch of them as were thought, by him, worthy of being pre&s;erved, were carefully taught to their children, in order to have them tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity.&mdash;It was one of tho&s;e occa|&s;ions that afforded the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent poem to O&s;&s;ian.&mdash;It is called in the origi|nal, the &s;ongs of Selma, which title it was thought proper to adopt in the tran&s;lation.</P>
<P>The poem is entirely lyric, and has great variety of ver&s;ification. The addre&s;s to the evening &s;tar, with which it opens, has in the original all the harmony that num|bers could give it; flowing down with all that tranquility and &s;oftne&s;s, which the &s;cene de&s;cribed naturally in&s;pires.&mdash;Three of the &s;ongs which are introduced in this piece, were publi&s;hed among the fragments of ancient poetry, printed la&s;t year.</P></NOTE>.</HEAD>

The &s;tormy winds are laid. The murmur of the torrent comes from afar. Roaring waves climb the di&s;tant rock. The flies of evening are on their feeble wings, and the hum of their cour&s;e is on the field. What do&s;t thou behold, fair light? But thou do&s;t &s;mile and depart. The waves come with joy around thee, and bathe thy lovely hair. Farewel, thou &s;ilent beam!&mdash;Let the light of O&s;&s;ian's &s;oul ari&s;e.</P>

<P>THOU wert &s;wift, O Morar! as a roe on the hill; terrible as a meteor of fire. Thy wrath was as the &s;torm. Thy &s;word in battle, as lightning in the field.

ERATH, &s;on of Odgal, repined; for his brother was &s;lain by Armar.

<P>ALONE, on the &s;ea-beat rock, my daughter was heard to com|plain. Frequent and loud were her cries; nor could her father re|lieve her. All night I &s;tood on the &s;hore. I &s;aw her by the faint beam of the moon. All night I heard her cries. Loud was the wind; and the rain beat hard on the &s;ide of the mountain. Before morning appeared, her voice was weak. It died away, like the evening-breeze among the gra&s;s of the rocks. Spent with grief &s;he expired. And left thee Armin alone: gone is my &s;trength in the war, and fallen my pride among women.</P>
<P>WHEN the &s;torms of the mountain come; when the north lifts the waves on high; I &s;it by the &s;ounding &s;hore, and look on the fatal rock. Often by the &s;etting moon I &s;ee the gho&s;ts of my chil|dren. Half-viewle&s;s, they walk in mournful conference together. Will none of you &s;peak in pity? They do not regard their father.

<P>SUCH were the words of the bards in the days of the &s;ong; when the king heard the mu&s;ic of harps, and the tales of other times.

Three hundred youths followed our &s;teps: the lovely &s;trangers were at my &s;ide.

<P>CALTHON ru&s;hed into the &s;tream: I bounded forward on my &s;pear. Teutha's race fell before us. Night came rolling down. Dunthalmo re&s;ted on a rock, amid&s;t an aged wood.

<P>Now half the night had pa&s;&s;ed away. Silence and darkne&s;s were on the field; &s;leep re&s;ted on the eyes of the heroes: Calthon's &s;ettling &s;oul was &s;till. His eyes were half-clo&s;ed; but the murmur of Teutha had not yet failed in his ear.&mdash;Pale, and &s;hewing his wounds, the gho&s;t of Colmar came: he bended his head over the hero, and rai&s;ed his feeble voice.</P>
<P>SLEEPS the &s;on of Rathmor in his night, and his brother low? Did we not ri&s;e to the chace together, and pur&s;ue the dark-brown hinds?

<P>SONS of Morven, I &s;aid, it is not thus our fathers fought.

<P>MORNING ro&s;e on the blue waters of Teutha; Colmal &s;tood before me in tears. She told of the chief of Clutha: and thrice the &s;pear fell from her hand. My wrath turned again&s;t the &s;tranger; for my &s;oul trembled for Calthon.</P>
<P>SON of the feeble hand, I &s;aid, do Teutha's warriors fight with tears?

Often has Morni &s;hone in battles, like the beam of the ri&s;ing &s;un; when he di&s;per&s;es the &s;torms of the hill, and brings peace to the glittering fields. But why did&s;t thou not re&s;t in thine age? Thy renown is in the &s;ong. The people behold thee, and ble&s;s the departure of mighty Morni. Why did&s;t thou not re&s;t in thine age? For the foe will vani&s;h before Fingal.</P>
<P>SON of Comhal, replied the chief, the &s;trength of Morni's arm has failed. I attempt to draw the &s;word of my youth, but it re|mains in its place. I throw the &s;pear, but it falls &s;hort of the mark; and I feel the weight of my &s;hield. We decay, like the gra&s;s of the mountain, and our &s;trength returns no more. I have a &s;on, O Fingal, his &s;oul has delighted in the actions of Morni's youth; but his &s;word has not been lifted again&s;t the foe, neither has his fame begun. I come with him to battle; to direct his arm. His re|nown will be a &s;un to my &s;oul, in the dark hour of my departure. O that the name of Morni were forgot among the people! that the heroes would only &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Behold the father of Gaul!"</Q></P>
<P>KING of Strumon, Fingal replied, Gaul &s;hall lift the &s;word in battle. But he &s;hall lift it before Fingal; my arm &s;hall defend his youth. But re&s;t thou in the halls of Selma; and hear of our renown. Bid the harp be &s;trung; and the voice of the bard ari&s;e, that tho&s;e who fall may rejoice in their fame; and the &s;oul of Morni brighten with gladne&s;s.&mdash;O&s;&s;ian! thou ha&s;t &s;ought in

<P>NIGHT came down on Morven. Fingal &s;at at the beam of the oak. Morni &s;at by his &s;ide with all his gray waving locks. Their di&s;cour&s;e is of other times, and the actions of their fathers.

<P>SUCH were the words of Gaul, when he came to Dunlathmon's towers. The gates were open and dark. The winds were blu&s;ter|ing in the hall.

<P>DAUGHTER of Nu&auml;th, &s;aid the hero, why do&s;t thou fly from Gaul? Do my eyes &s;end forth the flame of death? Or darkens hatred in my &s;oul?

The wind was abroad in the trees. I heard the &s;ound of arms. Joy ro&s;e in my face; for I thought of thy return. It was the chief of Cuthal, the red-haired &s;trength of Dunrommath. His eyes rolled in fire: the blood of my people was on his &s;word. They who defended Oithona fell by the gloomy chief.&mdash;What could I do? My arm was weak; it could not lift the &s;pear. He took me in my grief, amid&s;t my tears he rai&s;ed the &s;ail. He feared the returning &s;trength of Lathmon, the brother of unhappy Oithona.&mdash;But behold, he comes with his people! the dark wave is divided before him!&mdash;Whither wilt thou turn thy &s;teps, &s;on of Morni? Many are the warriors of Dun|rommath!</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="274">
MY &s;teps never turned from battle, replied the hero, as he un|&s;heathed his &s;word; and will I begin to fear, Oithona, when thy foes are near?

<P>THE daughter of Nu&auml;th went to the cave: a troubled joy ro&s;e on her mind, like the red path of the lightning on a &s;tormy cloud.&mdash;Her &s;oul was re&s;olved, and the tear was dried from her wildly|looking eye.&mdash;Dunrommath &s;lowly approached; for he &s;aw the &s;on of Morni. Contempt contracted his face, a &s;mile is on his dark-brown cheek; his red eye rolled, half-conceal'd, beneath his &s;haggy brows.</P>
<P>WHENCE are the &s;ons of the &s;ea, begun the gloomy chief? Have the winds driven you to the rocks of Trom&aacute;thon? Or come you in &s;earch of the white-handed daughter of Nu&auml;th? The &s;ons of the unhappy, ye feeble men, come to the hand of Dunrommath. His eye &s;pares not the weak; and he delights in the blood of &s;trangers.

<P>GAUL advanced in his arms; Dunrommath &s;hrunk behind his people. But the &s;pear of Gaul pierced the gloomy chief, and his &s;word lopped off his head, as it bended in death.&mdash;The &s;on of Morni &s;hook it thrice by the lock; the warriors of Dunrommath fled. The arrows of Morven pur&s;ued them: ten fell on the mo&s;&s;y rocks. The re&s;t lift the &s;ounding &s;ail, and bound on the eccho|ing deep.</P>
<P>GAUL advanced towards the cave of Oithona. He beheld a youth leaning again&s;t a rock. An arrow had pierced his &s;ide; and his eye rolled faintly beneath his helmet.&mdash;The &s;oul of Morni's &s;on is &s;ad, he came and &s;poke the words of peace.</P>
<P>CAN the hand of Gaul heal thee, youth of the mournful brow? I have &s;earched for the herbs of the mountains; I have gathered them on the &s;ecret banks of their &s;treams. My hand has clo&s;ed the wound of the valiant, and their eyes have ble&s;&s;ed the &s;on of Morni. Where dwelt thy fathers, warrior? Were they of the &s;ons of the mighty? Sadne&s;s &s;hall come, like night, on thy native &s;treams; for thou art fallen in thy youth.&mdash;</P>
<P>MY fathers, replied the &s;tranger, were of the &s;ons of the mighty; but they &s;hall not be &s;ad; for my fame is departed like morning mi&s;t.

There my bro|ther dwells. He is renowned in battle: give him this glitter|ing helmet.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="276">
THE helmet fell from the hand of Gaul; for it was the wounded Oithona. She had armed her&s;elf in the cave, and came in &s;earch of death. Her heavy eyes are half clo&s;ed; the blood pours from her &s;ide.&mdash;</P>
<P>SON of Morni, &s;he &s;aid, prepare the narrow tomb. Sleep comes, like a cloud, on my &s;oul. The eyes of Oithona are dim.

<HEAD>CROMA: A POEM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Malvina the daughter of To&s;car is overheard by O&s;&s;ian lamenting the death of O&s;car her lover. O&s;&s;ian, to divert her grief, relates his own actions in an ex edi|tion which he undertook, at Fingal's com|mand, to aid Crothar the petty king of Croma, a country in Ireland, again&s;t Roth|mar who invaded his dominions. The &s;tory is delivered down thus in tradition. Crothar king of Croma being blind with age, and his &s;on too young for the field, Rothmar the chief of Tromlo re&s;olved to avail him&s;elf of the opportunity offered of annexing the dominions of Crothar to his own. He accordingly marched into the country &s;ubject to Crothar, but which he held of Arth or Artho, who was, at the time, &s;upreme king of Ireland.</P>
<P>Crothar being, on account of his age and blindne&s;s, unfit for action, &s;ent for aid to Fingal king of Scotland; who ordered his &s;on O&s;&s;ian to the relief of Crothar. But before his arrival Fovar-gormo, the &s;on of Crothar, attacking Roth|mar, was &s;lain him&s;elf, and his forces to|tally defeated. O&s;&s;ian renewed the war; came to battle, killed Rothmar, and rout|ed his army. Croma being thus delivered of its enemies, O&s;&s;ian returned to Scot|land.</P></NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>IT was the voice of my love! few are his vi&s;its to the dreams of Malvina! Open your airy halls, ye fathers of mighty To&s;car. Unfold the gates of your clouds; the &s;teps of Malvina's departure are near. I have heard a voice in my dream. I feel the fluttering of my &s;oul. Why did&s;t thou come, O bla&s;t, from the dark-rolling of the lake? Thy ru&s;tling wing was in the trees, the dream of Mal|vina departed. But &s;he beheld her love, when his robe of mi&s;t flew on the wind; the beam of the &s;un was on his &s;kirts, they glit|tered like the gold of the &s;tranger.

I was a lovely tree, in thy pre&s;ence, O&s;car, with all my branches round me; but thy death came like a bla&s;t from the de&s;art, and laid my green head low; the &s;pring returned with its &s;howers, but no leaf of mine aro&s;e.

There is a joy in grief when peace dwells in the brea&s;t of the &s;ad. But &s;orrow wa&s;tes the mournful, O daughter of To&s;car, and their days are few. They fall away, like the flower on which the &s;un looks in his &s;trength after the mildew has pa&s;&s;ed over it, and its head is heavy with the drops of night.

He was the fir&s;t of mortal men; but Crothar had al&s;o his fame. The king of Morven prai&s;ed me, and he placed on my arm the bo&s;&s;y &s;hield of Calthar, whom the hero had &s;lain in war. Do&s;t thou not behold it on the wall, for Crothar's eyes have failed? Is thy &s;trength, like thy fathers, O&s;&s;ian? let the aged feel thine arm.</P>

<P>THE fea&s;t is &s;pread. The harp is heard; and joy is in the hall. But it was joy covering a &s;igh, that darkly dwelt in every brea&s;t. It was like the faint beam of the moon &s;pread on a cloud in heaven.

The clouds, divided, fly over the &s;ky, and &s;hew the burning &s;tars. The meteor, token of death! flies &s;parkling through the gloom. It re&s;ts on the hill. I &s;ee the withered fern, the dark browed rock, the fallen oak. Who is that in his &s;hrowd beneath the tree, by the &s;tream?</P>
<P>The waves dark-tumble on the lake, and la&s;h its rocky &s;ides. The boat is brim|full in the cove; the oars on the rocking tide. A maid &s;its &s;ad be&s;ide the rock, and eyes the rolling &s;tream. Her lover pro|mi&s;ed to come. She &s;aw his boat, when yet it was light, on the lake. Is this his broken boat on the &s;hore? Are the&s;e his groans on the wind?</P>
<P>Hark! the hail rattles around. The flaky &s;now de&s;cends. The tops of the hills are white. The &s;tormy winds abate. Va|rious is the night and cold; receive me, my friends, from night.</P>

<P>Night is calm and fair; blue, &s;tarry, &s;ettled is night. The winds, with the clouds, are gone. They &s;ink behind the hill. The moon is up on the mountain. Trees gli&s;ter: &s;treams &s;hine on the rock. Bright rolls the &s;ettled lake; bright the &s;tream of the vale.</P>
<P>I &s;ee the trees overturned; the &s;hocks of corn on the plain. The wakeful hind rebuilds the &s;hocks, and whi&s;tles on the di&s;tant field.</P>
<P>Calm, &s;ettled, fair is night!&mdash;Who comes from the place of the dead? That form with the robe of &s;now; white arms and dark-brown hair! It is the daughter of the chief of the people; &s;he that lately fell! Come, let us view thee, O maid! thou that ha&s;t been the delight of heroes! The bla&s;t drives the phantom away; white, without form, it a&s;cends the hill.</P>
<P>The breezes drive the blue mi&s;t, &s;lowly over the narrow vale. It ri&s;es on the hill, and joins its head to heaven.&mdash;Night is &s;ettled, calm, blue, &s;tarry, bright with the moon. Receive me not, my friends, for lovely is the night.</P>

<SPEAKER>FIFTH BARD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Night is calm, but dreary. The moon is in a cloud in the we&s;t. Slow moves that pale beam along the &s;haded hill. The di|&s;tant wave is heard. The torrent murmurs on the rock. The cock is heard from the booth. More than half the night is pa&s;t. The hou&s;e-wi&s;e, groping in the gloom, re|kindles the &s;ettled fire. The hunter thinks that day approaches, and calls his bound|ing dogs. He a&s;cends the hill and whi&s;tles on his way. A bla&s;t removes the cloud. He &s;ees the &s;tarry plough of the north. Much of the night is to pa&s;s. He nods by the mo&s;&s;y rock.</P>
<P>Hark! the whirlwind is in the wood! A low murmur in the vale! It is the mighty army of the dead returning from the air.</P>
<P>The moon re&s;ts behind the hill. The beam is &s;till on that lofty rock. Long are the &s;hadows of the trees. Now it is dark over all. Night is dreary, &s;ilent, and dark; receive me, my friends, from night.</P>

<SPEAKER>THE CHIEF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let clouds re&s;t on the hills: &s;pirits fly and travellers fear. Let the winds of the woods ari&s;e, the &s;ounding &s;torms de&s;cend. Roar &s;treams and windows flap, and green winged meteors fly; ri&s;e the pale moon from behind her hills, or inclo&s;e her head in clouds; night is alike to me, blue, &s;tor|my, or gloomy the &s;ky. Night flies before the beam, when it is poured on the hill. The young day returns from his clouds but we return no more.</P>
<P>Where are our chiefs of old? Where our kings of mighty name? The fields of their battles are &s;ilent. Scarce their mo&s;&s;y tombs remain. We &s;hall al&s;o be forgot.

his glittering &s;pear. The joy of Croma was great; for the gloomy Rothmar fell.</P>
<P>I RAISED my voice for Fovar-gormo, when they laid the chief in earth. The aged Crothar was there, but his &s;igh was not heard. He &s;earched for the wound of his &s;on, and found it in his brea&s;t. Joy ro&s;e in the face of the aged. He came and &s;poke to O&s;&s;ian.</P>

<HEAD>BERRATHON: A POEM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This poem is reputed to have been compo&s;ed by O&s;&s;ian, a little time before his death; and con&s;equently it is known in tradition by no other name than <HI>O&s;&s;ian's la&s;t hymn.</HI> The tran&s;lator has taken the liberty to call it <HI>Berrathon,</HI> from the epi&s;ode concerning the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of Larth|mor king of that i&s;land, after he had been dethroned by his own &s;on Uthal. Fingal in his voyage to Lochlin [Fing. B. III.] whither he had been invited by Starno the father of Agandecca, &s;o often mentioned in O&s;&s;ian's poems, touched at Berrathon, an i&s;land of Scandinavia, where he was kindly entertained by Larthmor the petty king of the place, who was a va&s;&s;al of the &s;upreme kings of Lochlin. The ho&s;pitality of Larth|mor gained him Fingal's friend&s;hip, which that hero manife&s;ted, after the impri&s;onment of Larthmor by his own &s;on, by &s;ending O&s;&s;ian and To&s;car, the father of Malvina &s;o often mentioned, to re&s;cue Larthmor, and to puni&s;h the unnatural behaviour of Uthal. Uthal was hand&s;ome to a proverb, and con&s;equently much admired by the ladies. Nina-thoma the beautiful daughter of Tor|th&oacute;ma, a neighbouring prince, fell in love and fled with him. He proved uncon&s;tant; for another lady, who&s;e name is not men|tioned, gaining his affections, he confined Nina-thoma to a de&s;art i&s;land near the coa&s;t of Berrathon. She was relieved by O&s;&s;ian, who, in company with To&s;car, landing on Berrathon, defeated the forces of Uthal, and killed him in a &s;ingle combat. Nina-thoma, who&s;e love not all the bad behaviour of Uthal could era&s;e, hearing of his death, died of grief. In the mean time Larthmor is re&s;tored, and O&s;&s;ian and To&s;car returned in triumph to Fingal.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent poem opens with an elegy on the death of Malvina the daughter of To&s;car, and clo&s;es with pre&s;ages of the poet's death. It is almo&s;t altogether in a lyric mea&s;ure, and has that melancholy air which di&s;tingui&s;hes the remains of the works of O&s;&s;ian. If ever he compo&s;ed any thing of a merry turn it is long &s;ince lo&s;t. The &s;erious and melancholy make the mo&s;t la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions on the human mind, and bid faire&s;t for being tran&s;mitted from generation to generation by tradition. Nor is it probable that O&s;&s;ian dea't much in chearful compo&s;ition. Melancholy is &s;o much the companion of a great genius, that it is difficult to &s;eparate the idea of levity from chearfulne&s;s, which is &s;ome|times the mark of an amiable di&s;po&s;ition, but never the characteri&s;tic of elevated parts.</P></NOTE>.</HEAD>

<P>How long will ye roll around me, blue-tumbling waters of ocean? My dwelling was not always in caves, nor beneath the whi&s;tling tree.

<P>WE ro&s;e on the heath before the king; he &s;topt in the mid&s;t of his cour&s;e. His heroes gathered around, and a gray-haired bard ad|vanced.

He &s;preads no fea&s;t in his hall: the blood of &s;trangers is on his &s;treams. If from Selma's walls ye come, from the mo&s;&s;y walls of Fingal, chu&s;e three youths to go to your king to tell of the fall of his people.

<P>NEVER will it ri&s;e, O bard, I &s;aid in the pride of my wrath. He would &s;hrink in the pre&s;ence of Fingal, who&s;e eyes are the flames of death.
