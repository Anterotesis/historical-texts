<P>Dear Jacinta, I fain would flatter my&s;elf, but am not able; the Ble&s;&s;ing's too great to be my Lot: Yet 'tis

<P>That's the Way to pro&s;per; however, &s;o far I'll confe&s;s the Truth to thee; at lea&s;t if that don't do, nothing el&s;e will, Men are mighty &s;imple in Love-matters, Sir: When you &s;u&s;pect a Woman's falling off, you fall a plaguing her to bring her on again, attack her with Rea&s;on, and a &s;our Face: Ud&s;life, Sir, attack her with a Fiddle, double your good Humour&mdash;give her a Ball&mdash;powder your Periwig at her, &mdash;let her cheat you at Cards a little, and I'll warrant all's right again.</P>

<P>YOU &s;ee me as much enrag'd at it, as you are your&s;elf, yet my Brain is roving after the Cau&s;e, for &s;omething there mu&s;t be; never Letter was receiv'd by Man with more Pa&s;&s;ion and Tran&s;port; I was almo&s;t as charming a Godde&s;s as your&s;elf, only for bringing it. Yet when in a Moment after I come with a Me&s;&s;age worth a dozen on't, never was Witch &s;o handled; &s;omething mu&s;t have pa&s;s'd between one and t'other, that's &s;ure.</P>

<P>Nothing cou'd pa&s;s worth my enquiring after, &s;ince nothing cou'd happen that can excu&s;e his U&s;age of me; he had a Letter under my Hand which own'd him Ma&s;ter of my Heart; and till I contradicted it with my Mouth, he ought not to doubt the Truth on't.</P>

<SPEAKER>Jacin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay I confe&s;s, Madam, I ha'nt a Word to &s;ay for him, I'm afraid he's but a Rogue at bottom, as well as my Shamele&s;s that attends him; we are bit, by my Troth, and haply well enough &s;erv'd, for li&s;tning to the glib Tongues of the Ra&s;cals.</P>

<P>And let one Thing be your Comfort by the Way, Madam, that in &s;pight of all your dear Affections to him, you have had the Grace to keep him at Arms End. You han't thank'd me for't; but good Faith 'twas well I did not &s;tir out of the Chamber that fond Night. For there are Times the &s;toute&s;t of us are in Danger, the Ra&s;cals wheedle &s;o.</P>

<P>For my Part, I never yet cou'd bear a Slight from any Thing, nor will I now. There's but one Way however to re&s;ent it from a Woman; and that's to drive her bravely from your Heart, and place a worthier in her vacant Throne.</P>

<P>Now with Submi&s;&s;ion to my Betters, I have another Way, Sir, I'll drive my Tyrant from my Heart, and place my&s;elf in her Throne. Yes; I will be Lord of my own Tenement, and keep my Hou&s;hold in Order. Wou'd you, wou'd do &s;o too, Ma&s;ter; for, look you, I have been Ser|vitour in a College at Salamancha, and read Philo&s;ophy with the Doctors; where I found that a Woman, in all Times, has been ob&s;erv'd to be an Animal hard to under&s;tand, and much inclin'd to Mi&s;chief. Now as an Animal is always an Animal, and a Captain always a Captain, &s;o a Woman is al|ways a Woman: Whence it is that a certain Greek &s;ays, her Head is like a Bank of Sand; or, as another, a &s;olid Rock; or, according to a third, a dark Lanthorn. Pray, Sir, ob&s;erve, for this is clo&s;e Rea&s;oning; and &s;o as the Head is the Head of the Body; and that the Body without a Head, is like a Head without a Tail; and that where there is neither Head nor Tail, 'tis a very &s;trange Body: So I &s;ay a Woman is by Compari&s;on, do you &s;ee (for nothing explains things like Compari&s;ons) I &s;ay by Compari&s;on, as Ari&s;totle has often &s;aid before me, one may compare her to the raging Sea; for as the Sea, when the Wind ri&s;es, knits its Brows like an angry Bull, and that Waves mount upon Rocks, and Rocks mount upon Waves; that Porpu&s;&s;es leap like Trouts, and Whales &s;kip about like Gudgeons; that Ships roll like Beer Barrels, and Mariners pray like Saints; ju&s;t &s;o, I &s;ay, a Woman&mdash;A Woman, I &s;ay, ju&s;t &s;o, when her Rea&s;on is &s;hipwreck'd upon her Pa&s;&s;ion, and the Hulk of her Under&s;tanding lies thump, thump, thumping again&s;t the Rock of her Fury; then it is, I &s;ay, that by certain Immotions, which &mdash;um&mdash;cau&s;e, as one may &s;uppo&s;e, a &s;ort of Convul|&s;ive&mdash;yes&mdash;hurricanious&mdash;um&mdash;like&mdash;in &s;hort, a Woman is like the Devil.
