<HEAD>CHAP. I. THE PROPRIETOR'S PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I AM &s;itting down to write a book for the u&s;e of all tho&s;e projectors who build towns upon poetical principles. No man is better quali|fied, as far as experience goes, to &s;et this matter in a properer light than my&s;elf, becau&s;e I have wa&s;ted more brick, mortar, and money, than any other individual in Europe. Let him who hath &s;een, judge; and let him
<PB N="2" REF="12">point out proprieties to others who hath bitterly felt his own folly. It is on this principle that I &s;hall circum|&s;tantially relate certain plea&s;antries which co&s;t me many years of my time, and many thou&s;and pounds of my money.</P>
<P>Not that this work will be gene|rally u&s;eful; for, luckily, more of my readers erect hou&s;es for them&s;elves than for others; and there is no dan|ger of its ever becoming a <HI>fa&s;hion</HI> to ruin one&s;elf by a good intention. Be|nevolence is in the&s;e days a tolerable oeconomi&s;t&mdash;as prudent a lady as could be well de&s;ired in a family&mdash;and we have nothing to fear from the in|fluence of exce&s;&s;ive virtues. The na|tion will never be de&s;troyed that way.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="13">Prai&s;e, therefore, to the di&s;creet qualities of the age, my warning will be only for a few, and tho&s;e chiefly a &s;et of &s;impletons who work up their hearts to a warmth that mounts into the brain, and brings on the convul|&s;ions of &s;ympathy. Such hath been my di&s;order.</P>
<P>It is to you, ye gentle beings, who&s;e bo&s;oms are fraught with foreign woes; who&s;e weeping eyes and milky tem|pers render you the &s;laves rather than the friends of virtue: to you I addre&s;s the &s;entiments and the adventures of a man who was arrogant enough to &s;uppo&s;e he could make human crea|tures live FOR rather than UPON one another.</P>
<P>Yes, I am the man who hath at|tempted this. The &s;ucce&s;s or mi&s;car|riage
<PB N="4" REF="14">of that attempt mu&s;t be <HI>your le&s;&s;on.</HI> As to the re&s;t of the world, I de&s;ire heartily it may have <HI>its laugh.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall have no objection to &s;uch ri|dicule. The labourer is worthy of his hire.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. A GOOD-NATURED PAGE OR TWO, WHICH MAY PERHAPS MEND THE READER'S TEMPER.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT &s;ix years ago I had re|tired into one of the mo&s;t ro|mantick parts of Cumberland, and was one day &s;o tenderly inclined&mdash; men have their fits of benevolence&mdash; that every thing within contact was the better for me. It happened to be a day too, wherein many opportuni|ties of being gracious pre&s;ented them|&s;elves. De&s;tiny &s;eemed to take ad|vantage of it by a care to &s;upply me with objects. It is worth your while to mark how my feelings were exerci&s;ed. The old cat brought into the world nine young; and I &s;aw
<PB N="6" REF="16">eight of them ba&s;ketted for death. Savage, cried I, to the &s;ervant, carry back the poor things to their mother! and in&s;tead of &s;traw let them be wrapped up in cotton. Scarce was this reprieve given to the offspring of one party, before that of another ro&s;e to view. I was one of his maje&s;ty's ju&s;tices, and, it &s;eems, the peace, which it was my office to guard, had been broken by a wench who had been &s;o improvident to follow the impul&s;es of nature before they were &s;anctified by law. Wretch, (&s;aid the con&s;table who was dragging her before me) how dare you bring your burthens on this pari&s;h? Wretch, (&s;aid I to the con|&s;table) what is that to thee? So I gently chid the mother, and ki&s;&s;ed the child, for &s;he had concealed her|&s;elf
<PB N="7" REF="17">till that time, and was taken in the wicked act of giving it &s;uck. This fired the feelings of the con&s;table and &s;oftened mine. Let a chamber and a cradle be provided for this child, and give &s;omething comfortable to the mo|ther, and pray carry &s;ome new milk to the cat with nine kittens: Shall I &s;ave a cat, and have no charity for a fellow-creature? The&s;e &s;trokes &s;o &s;moothed me, and prepared for future events, that I was almo&s;t afraid to breathe out my joy, le&s;t with that breath I &s;hould de&s;troy the animalcula which naturali&s;ts &s;ay are thereby murthered. I &s;et my foot on the ground with cau|tion, le&s;t I &s;hould cru&s;h &s;ome hone&s;t in&s;ect that might be as well di&s;po&s;ed as my&s;elf. My very legs ached when I perceived I was within an hair's
<PB N="8" REF="18">breadth of extirminating an ant who was laden with food, which I could not but fancy was de&s;igned to a &s;ick friend in the neighbouring hillock. As I pur&s;ued my walk along my gar|den, wi&s;hing the univer&s;e a thou&s;and good lucks, I ca&s;t my eye a&s;lant a quick-&s;et, and &s;aw a Linnet extending the maternal wing over her ne&s;t. Look|ing behind me, I beheld the gardener whetting his &s;heers. Hark ye friend, &s;aid I, in that hedge there is a family which I take upon me to protect, and therefore &s;o far from your clipping off a twig&mdash;But, &s;ir, it &s;poils the look of the whole garden, interrupted the gardener. I was &s;o &s;hocked at the fel|low's inhumanity, that my hand had, in&s;en&s;ibly, got into my pocket to feel for the price of his di&s;charge. Not
<PB N="9" REF="19">choo&s;ing to be whim&s;ical, I thought it be&s;t to go another way to work. I put half a crown into his hand, and told him I preferred the luxuriant branches of the natural hedge to the &s;mugge&s;t alteration he and his &s;heers could po&s;&s;ibly make. This did not quite &s;atisfy him. The man had got a habit of &s;poiling Nature, and loved lopping away a beauty in his &s;oul. My Linnet &s;eemed to &s;u&s;pect him. She had &s;hifted about in her ne&s;t &s;o as to command his whole per&s;on. I trembled for her. How is thy wife to-day, John? &s;aid I. As well as can be ex|pected, &s;ir, replied he, for a woman who looks to be brought to bed every hour; &s;he has the head-ach too, and I am obliged to take off my &s;hoes to go into her chamber. John, &s;aid I, you
<PB N="10" REF="20">are a very hone&s;t fellow&mdash;give me your hand&mdash;let us walk and &s;peak &s;oftly: there is a worthy female in your wife's &s;ituation, now in that hedge.</P>
<P>Is there, &s;ir?&mdash;an&s;wered the gar|dener in a whi&s;per, and collecting into his face all the lines of caution&mdash;hu&s;h &mdash;hu&s;h&mdash;hu&s;h&mdash;</P>
<P>He beckoned me exactly as he would have done had I ra&s;hly opened the door of his wife's chamber. The &s;en&s;ation was brought home.</P>
<P>There is no call for &s;heers at pre|&s;ent, &s;ir, &s;aid he, and the le&s;s we walk that way the better&mdash;hu&s;h&mdash;hu&s;h&mdash; hu&s;h.&mdash;</P>
<P>He now repeated his &s;ignal to keep &s;ilence, and went off on tip-toe till he gained the green&s;ward.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="21">Thus was my humour &s;till more &s;weetened; I was &s;o happy that I looked up to the &s;un, which &s;hone on me, with emulation; with rivalry.</P>
<P>A little rhap&s;ody e&s;caped me&mdash;and, were it po&s;&s;ible, my beam &s;hould be like thine. There is not a &s;ingle ob|ject which &s;ome ray or other of my benevolence &s;hould not animate.</P>
<P>Taking my eyes from the heavens, and ca&s;ting them to earth, I &s;aw a clu&s;ter of Pinks drooping for want of a &s;upport. Warmed as I then was, 'tis inconceivable with how much plea&s;ure I placed them about a &s;tick and tied them gently round it. As they &s;tood erect in their new attitude there came from them an odour that &s;eemed to thank me. It may be the
<PB N="12" REF="22">fragrance of gratitude! Imagination cho&s;e to think it &s;uch. What amiable deception!</P>
<P>But I had ju&s;t turned from the flowers when an in&s;ect which &s;ettled upon my left cheek &s;tung me &s;o &s;en|&s;ibly that I rai&s;ed up my arm, and &s;pread my hand to flap it into annihi|lation. Bodily pain is a trying point. I took out a pocket gla&s;s (which I happened to have about me) and viewed my enemy. The motion had alarmed him, and his tongue was taken out of my cheek. There are &s;trange traits in my character. I re|pre&s;ented him as having ju&s;t ri&s;en from banquetting to his heart's content. The orifice he had made was not big|ger than a &s;mall pin's head. The ap|pearance
<PB N="13" REF="23">was at wor&s;t that of a pim|ple&mdash;the pain was gone. It is but the harve&s;t bump of an happy in&s;ect, &s;aid I.&mdash;It was too fine a day methought to bani&s;h any thing animate from the light, and I was in too good a temper to be vindictive.&mdash;</P>
<P>Get thee gone, fool, &s;aid I&mdash;&s;hake|ing my head. Much good may it do thee. It buzzed thanks, and flew away.</P>
<P>At this cri&s;is my daughter came running to tell me her Canary had re|covered, and &s;he had ju&s;t &s;aved her brood of Chicks from the Kite.</P>
<P>Better and better &s;till, Matilda, &s;aid I, let us go into the hou&s;e. The heart was &s;tirred.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. OF THE LATE WM. SHENSTONE, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>TO exerci&s;e the &s;oul in benevolent trifles is a good way to prepare it for matters of more con&s;equence. After the&s;e tran&s;actions, I and my daughter Matilda were &s;ittting at the door of an airy hall that commanded one of the fine&s;t lawns in my garden. What an evening! &s;aid Matilda; is there any thing in nature, papa, &s;o fine as a &s;etting &s;un! Yes, &s;aid I in an extacy, &s;tarting at the &s;ame time from my &s;eat, a <HI>ri&s;ing</HI> one. Matilda agreed to the remark, but &s;eemed &s;ur|pri&s;ed at the emotion. She did not know there was more "meant than met the ear." While ideas were ope|rating
<PB N="15" REF="25">into fit language there was a profound &s;ilence: and during this in|terval on our parts, the birds began to carol forth their evening &s;ongs, and all the notes of a &s;ummer &s;un-&s;et|ting-time poured upon the ear. In this voluptuous &s;en&s;ation we remained, till Matilda ran to the library and brought a book, telling me, that <HI>read|ing</HI> was the only thing wanting to per|fect our felicity. Then read, my dear, &s;aid I: read.</P>
<P>I have brought one of tho&s;e books, papa, (continued Matilda) which was written by your friend <HI>Mr. Shen&s;tone.</HI> Look ye, it is the &s;econd volume.</P>
<P>You could not have laid your fair hand on any thing &s;o <HI>apropos.</HI> Shen|&s;tone is, of all other moderns, <HI>the</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="26">author to fini&s;h a fine evening after having pa&s;&s;ed the former part of the day in gentle deeds.</P>
<P>Where then &s;hall I read?</P>
<P>You cannot open him ami&s;s.</P>
<P>Ah! generous enthu&s;ia&s;m, how wert thou befriended in this moment! The fir&s;t &s;entiment which Matilda recited was the following. The &s;oul of Shen|&s;tone &s;hone through every &s;yllable.</P>
<Q>I feel an avarice of &s;ocial plea&s;ure, which produces only mortification: I never &s;ee a town or city in a map, but I figure to my&s;elf many agree|able per&s;ons in it, with whom I could wi&s;h to be acquainted.</Q>
<P>What a thought! &s;aid I; I could have found it in my heart to have
<PB N="17" REF="27">&s;allied out in &s;earch of new and va|luable acquaintance! The kind nerves began to thrill.</P>
<P>The next &s;entiment which my daughter pitched upon carried the matter &s;till farther.</P>
<Q>What Miriads wi&s;h to be as ble&s;t as I!</Q>
<P>The idea of all the large property I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed came acro&s;s me, and I could not help &s;aying&mdash;what Miriads then could I ble&s;s! The warmth of the blood increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>The third pa&s;&s;age co&s;t me forty thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<Q>Had I a fortune of eight or ten thou&s;and pounds a year, I would, methinks, make my&s;elf a neighbour|hood. I would fir&s;t build a village
<PB N="18" REF="28">with a church, and people it with inhabitants of &s;ome branch of trade that was &s;uitable to the coun|try round. I would then, at proper di&s;tances, erect a number of genteel boxes, of about a thou&s;and pounds apiece, and amu&s;e my&s;elf with giving them all the advantages they could receive from ta&s;te. The&s;e would I people with a &s;elect number of well-cho&s;en friends, a&s;&s;igning to each an|nually the &s;um of two hundred pounds for life. The &s;alary &s;hould be irrevocable in order to give them independency. The hou&s;e, of a more precarious tenure that, in ca&s;es of ingratitude, I might introduce another inhabitant.</Q>
<P>At the clo&s;e of this &s;entence which, by the bye, did not fini&s;h the pa&s;&s;age,
<PB N="19" REF="29">Matilda ki&s;&s;ed the printed page and &s;aid a thou&s;and civil things of the au|thor. It was impo&s;&s;ible to go any further. My whole &s;oul was at work. Do&s;t thou not begin to &s;mile reader?</P>
<P>Ah! Matilda, had I permitted thee to read the other period, thou mighte&s;t have been at lea&s;t forty thou&s;and pounds richer.</P>
<P>We &s;hall clo&s;e Mr. Shen&s;tone's book and this chapter together. It &s;hows a good deal.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. WHICH PROVES THE AUTHOR'S DAUGH|TER TO BE A STRANGE GIRL.</HEAD>
<P>THE gentle Matilda took me by the arm, and we had another turn in the garden. The la&s;t linger|ing efforts of light were glimmering. It was the &s;till hour, when benevolent &s;chemes are be&s;t projected. Sitting down on a painted bench, we entered into conver&s;ation. Daughter, &s;aid I, were it not for thee, I feel my&s;elf this moment full of a plan that I &s;hould certainly put in practi&s;e. The plans, which my papa forms, <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be all generous, and I am, therefore, con|cerned to hear that <HI>I</HI> &s;tand in the way
<PB N="21" REF="31">betwixt him and a generous action. Matilda, you are naturally intitled to my fortune. It is a bachelor only who can be rich enough to be whim|&s;ical. There is a powerful check on a father. He is accountable to his child for every guinea; &s;o that though I am full (as I &s;aid before) of a &s;cheme which might perhaps build up the happine&s;s of many families, I cannot per&s;uade my&s;elf to do it on the ruins of thy inheritance. No, I would rather &s;eem ju&s;t than ro|mantick.</P>
<P>Pray, &s;ir, how rich may you be?</P>
<P>I have ten thou&s;and a-year and &s;ome ready money, Matilda.</P>
<P>Had I that &s;um, I &s;hould lay out <HI>nine</HI> of them, annually, in the cau&s;e
<PB N="22" REF="32">of various humanity, and live like a queen upon my tenths.</P>
<P>Indeed!</P>
<P>And does my papa &s;uppo&s;e I could be guilty of employing more than a thou&s;and pounds a-year upon <HI>my&s;elf?</HI> (I told thee, reader, &s;he was a &s;trange girl.)</P>
<P>Oh! there are many who employ that &s;um on their individual &s;elves in a month, my dear.</P>
<P>Perhaps &s;o: but it is a <HI>&s;cience</HI> too difficult for your Matilda; &s;o pray <HI>pur&s;ue your project,</HI> &s;ir.</P>
<P>Will it not clip the wing of your future liberality &s;hould mine be now exerted to the u&s;age of the greate&s;t part of my fortune? Con&s;ider Ma|tilda.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="33">Can a great example&mdash;can learning me how to fly to the noble&s;t heights clip the wings of liberality? No, &s;ir, it will rather expand them; the &s;ooner generous actions are done the better; and the &s;ooner you learn me the <HI>art</HI> of doing them in the mo&s;t effectual manner, the more rea&s;on &s;hall I have to thank you. Pray, papa, do your duty by me.</P>
<P>How much, Matilda, would you give to &s;ee a large groupe of your fellow-creatures perfectly indepen|dent? To have all their tears dried up, and to make them uninterruptedly happy? Suppo&s;e, I &s;ay, &s;uch a point re&s;ted with you, at what rate would you purcha&s;e it? Be ingenuous.</P>
<P>Let me &s;ee&mdash;you have, you &s;ay ten thou&s;and pounds a-year: why
<PB N="24" REF="34">then I would give preci&s;ely <HI>nine thou|&s;and five hundred;</HI> and if one very hard place yet remained which <HI>another</HI> hundred could &s;mooth, I would not &s;tand out for that too. The <HI>re&s;t</HI> I would keep in my own hands, be|cau&s;e I have a right to independence as much as another. (Did&s;t ever hear &s;uch a Simpleton, reader!)</P>
<P>And this you would actually and chearfully do upon your honour?</P>
<P>Chearfully and actually upon my honour.</P>
<P>Then my dear let us go into the hou&s;e, and &s;ee what &s;teps are nece&s;|&s;ary to <HI>realize</HI> the benevolent project of friend SHENSTONE.</P>
<P>What a delicious idea, &s;aid Ma|tilda, with tears in her eyes: ble&s;&s;ed
<PB N="25" REF="35">be the memory of the charming poet for &s;ugge&s;ting the thought, and ble&s;&s;ed the &s;pirit of my father which carries it into execution.</P>
<P>We talked over the matter for two hours, and then parted for the night. To which fool, reader, do&s;t thou give preference; the father, or the child?</P>

<P>REPOSE was bani&s;hed from the pillow. She was cha&s;ed away as an unwelcome gue&s;t. Fancy and all her fairy train were admitted in her &s;tead. I could not help anticipating my joys; and upon meeting Matilda at breakfa&s;t, I found we had pa&s;&s;ed the night in the &s;ame way.

<PB N="27" REF="37">with which &s;he advi&s;ed me, in my choice of ground, to take care it commanded verdant walks, and wind|ing vallies, hills regularly climbing one beyond another, with plenty of &s;hade for love and for poetry, fore&s;ts of the thicke&s;t gloom for philo&s;ophers, and water for ca&s;cades and for conve|nience. You cannot, papa, &s;aid &s;he, be too cautious in this particular, for if your village is not well &s;ituated, and highly embelli&s;hed, it will be im|po&s;&s;ible to make any thing of it.</P>
<P>But although one might allow this embroidery to the gaiety of a girl like Matilda, I did not think it decent &s;o to ta&s;&s;el and fringe my <HI>own</HI> ideas; being indeed more &s;olicitous about finding a <HI>whole&s;ome</HI> &s;pot, than one merely poetical and picture&s;que.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="38">Yet notwith&s;tanding my ardour, I &s;oon perceived there would be more heads than one nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;um|moned. The labour of my &s;cheme mul|tiplied as I thought on it; and the more I weighed it, the more caution and con|&s;ultation became nece&s;&s;ary. What would I not have given for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of half a dozen heads as well turned to the airy mechanicks of building ca&s;tles as my&s;elf. But I was too well read in the modern hi&s;tory of the heart to &s;uppo&s;e my plan would meet general approbation. How did I wi&s;h that friend <HI>Shen&s;tone</HI> him&s;elf was yet alive, that I might repair to Hales-Owen, and turn his paradi&s;e of the Lea&s;owes into a village garden. How con|formable, &s;aid I, would this be to the philanthropic turn of his mind!
<PB N="29" REF="39">What a plea&s;ing compliment to rai&s;e up a neighbourhood in the way he him&s;elf chalked out!</P>
<P>Meditating on the&s;e points, it was long before I could &s;elect, from the circle of my friends, any per&s;ons whom I conceived proper to &s;peak to on the &s;ubject. Matilda had all the favourable di&s;po&s;itions in the world to expend money upon plau&s;ible pro|jects; but her imagination was too florid, and her years too tender, to a&s;|&s;i&s;t me in the actual execution.</P>
<P>It was at the time that I was thus undetermined whom to choo&s;e for a confident, that a man who had been twenty eight years the family &s;teward, and who&s;e locks were grown &s;ilver in hone&s;t &s;ervitude, made his appearance
<PB N="30" REF="40">before me. He was an arch, expe|rienced fellow, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed much of that which receives half its merit from a quaint manner and delivery, and had &s;o competent a &s;kill in general &s;ub|jects, that he obtained in my pari&s;h the nick-name of <HI>The Oracle.</HI></P>
<P>Some of his qualities would, I own, have deterred me from di&s;clo&s;ing the circum&s;tance to him, had not others encouraged me. The&s;e encourage|ments were principally the goodne&s;s of his heart, and the queerne&s;s of his humour; the fir&s;t of which induced him to a thou&s;and worthy actions, and the &s;econd rendered him a mo&s;t companionable creature. He was &s;tarch, &s;tay'd, generous, waggi&s;h, ori|ginal, and odd.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="41">But the bu&s;ine&s;s which he now came about was favourable to that greater one which rolled in my mind. He came to inform me, that as the warm weather was now &s;et in, my &s;heep might be SAFELY wa&s;hed and &s;heered. There is no danger now, &s;ir, &s;aid he, of the poor fools catch|ing cold; for, in troth, it always gives me the &s;tomach-ach whenever I &s;ee them ducked head over heels, and then &s;ent, without their warm coats, to &s;hake and &s;hiver in the &s;hade. But now, &s;ir, <HI>now</HI> the clo&s;er you clip, the cooler. Whet the &s;heers, &s;ir; whet the &s;heers.</P>
<P>This looked to me like the exact moment of communication, and I bid Mr. Samuel Sarca&s;m &s;hut the door and come nearer. I took his wri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="42">Hone&s;t Samuel, &s;aid I, you have been very long an ornament to my family, and I hope you and your's will continue in it to the late&s;t po&s;te|rity. You mu&s;t know I have pre&s;ent occa&s;ion for your a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I have thoughts of improving my e&s;tate, particularly that part which lieth in Wales.</P>
<P>If, indeed, you could bring that to <HI>bear,</HI> &s;ir, &s;aid Samuel, you would do &s;omething; for there is about ten acres of heath on the left &s;ide of your plantations and nur&s;eries that di&s;gu&s;t me horridly: that part of the earth &s;eems to be lazy, &s;ir, and an&s;wereth not the ends of its creation; and ten acres of wa&s;te is atrocious; quite atrocious.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="43">Very true: what is to be done, Samuel?</P>
<P>Why, &s;ir, as it is gone too far for the plough, and, I believe, would not grow much grain, I do not know but it might an&s;wer well enough for &s;ome other purpo&s;e. Your tenant, Turnland, who occupies the Leas beyond it, tells me, there are &s;uch a &s;carcity of hou&s;es in that part of Wales, that a man of property might venture to build a little.</P>
<P>To <HI>build,</HI> Samuel?&mdash;Pray go on&mdash; your di&s;cour&s;e charms me.</P>
<P>I am moreover in&s;tructed, &s;ir, that many huts thereabouts are dropping into decay, and that the Welch land|lords are, in general, too poor to re-build. Suppo&s;e, therefore, that you
<PB N="34" REF="44">were to run up a few neat cottages and &s;mall farm-hou&s;es in this very &s;pot that I &s;peak of; depend on it they would lett well, and thus we might make the ground grateful to the proprietor perforce.</P>
<P>Very true, upon my &s;oul, Samuel, cried I in great rapture, and we will call it SHENSTONE-GREEN.</P>
<P>Call it what you will, &s;ir, replied Samuel, but were I you, I would in&s;i&s;t on making every foot of land that I had in the world <HI>do its duty.</HI> To let ground lie idle, becau&s;e it is naturally indolent, is, as I take it, criminal, &s;ir. No man &s;hould pre&s;ume to &s;ay a thing is bar|ren till he &s;ees it is impo&s;&s;ible to make it bring forth.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="45">A noble argument, Samuel, and I can improve it. Fetch <HI>Shen&s;tone,</HI> Matilda: <HI>Shen&s;tone,</HI> Volume the &s;econd.</P>
<P>While Matilda was gone into the library, the good &s;teward &s;at him&s;elf coolly down, and began his calcula|tion. But &s;carce had he demon&s;trated twice eight to be &s;ixteen, before Ma|tilda came &s;kipping in with Shen|&s;tone.</P>
<P>Read, man (&s;aid I to Samuel, giving him the book, and pointing to the pa&s;&s;age). No &s;ooner had he read it, than he laid down the book upon a table, and &s;aid with a fignificant &s;mile&mdash;it is fine talking.</P>
<P>Well, Samuel, what do you think of it?</P>
<P>I &s;aid, &s;ir, it is fine talking.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="46">But &s;uppo&s;e one was to <HI>act</HI> in that manner? Would it not be plea&s;ing? Would it not be carrying the hu|man almo&s;t into the divine nature?</P>
<P>It would indeed, &s;ir; it would be doing as one &s;hould never be done by; and &s;o far it would be exceeding the commands of holy writ, which only ordereth us to do unto others as we wi&s;h they would do unto us; and to wi&s;h any man to throw away his money and time in that manner would be atrocious; quite atrocious.</P>
<P>Samuel, Samuel, I am re&s;olved upon my &s;cheme, and &s;o do not at|tempt to &s;neer me out of it. I will act according to that advice you have ju&s;t read, and I will have a town of my own for purpo&s;es therein men|tioned,
<PB N="37" REF="47">without delay. A town I will build, and the name of it &s;hall be SHENSTONE-GREEN.</P>
<P>Then, &s;ir, it would be atrocious in me to gain&s;ay it; &s;o if you will plea&s;e to intru&s;t the book to me, I will calculate how much you can do with your income in conformity to the gentleman's fancy. But, under favour, &s;ir, who might be the pro|jector of this romance?</P>
<P>I now &s;howed Samuel the title|page, which &s;tands thus: <Q>The Works, in Pro&s;e and Ver&s;e, of WILLIAM SHENSTONE, E&s;q. with Decorations.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Decorations</HI> indeed, &s;aid Samuel, putting the book into his pocket;
<PB N="38" REF="48">thy head was well decorated, Mr. Poet, I warrant it.&mdash;Then turning to me&mdash;I marvel, &s;ir, this pa&s;&s;age &s;hould be in <HI>pro&s;e,</HI> for I will be &s;o bold to &s;ay it has all the properties of <HI>poetry,</HI> and might very well figure in a fairy tale; but, &s;ir, it is your affair and not mine, and it would be therefore atrocious for me to &s;ay more.</P>
<P>To-morrow, &s;ir, added he, I will tell you within an hundred of bricks what may be done.</P>
<P>In &s;o doing, Samuel, you will oblige me, and in the mean time a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf that, with the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of a deputy, thou &s;halt be &s;teward of <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green.</HI></P>
<P>It &s;ufficeth, replied Samuel, and &s;o went away.</P>

<P>PERFECTLY &s;oothed and &s;ati&s;|fied with my&s;elf and with my project, I coloured the new Arcadia, which I was about to rai&s;e around me, in the mo&s;t attracting manner.

<P><PB N="40" REF="50">In the triumph of the&s;e pro&s;pects, the &s;teward again advanced with the paper of calculation in his hand.

Friend, Samuel, (&s;aid I to him, as he deli|berately advanced towards me) we mu&s;t not be over exact in this affair. We mu&s;t, as it were, indulge our tempers in a &s;ort of poetical li|cence&mdash;a few thou&s;and pounds, one way or other, &s;hould make no dif|ference in the great cau&s;e of com|municating joy.

<P>Ah! would to God, &s;aid Matilda, the village were &s;et fairly about! <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green!</HI> What a &s;weet name!</P>

<P><PB N="42" REF="52">The &s;ordid title to his account ran &s;o little to my mind, that I threw down the paper, and re&s;olved to read no further. The very idea of &s;uch oeconomy &s;hocked.</P>

<P>THIS volume was the "De&s;crip|tion of <HI>Millenium-Hall,</HI> and the country adjacent, together with the characters of the inhabitants, &amp;c."&mdash; If my fancy was before heated, it was, upon the reading this per|formance, fairly in flames: Not that I approved all the regulations of the Millenium Society, or thought the &s;y&s;tem of benevolence by any means &s;atisfactory, but becau&s;e I was, ju&s;t at that time, in the humour to catch avidly at every thing that gave an opportunity to prai&s;e my own project, and oppo&s;e the &s;ignificant looks of Samuel, <HI>The Oracle.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. A PANEGYRIC ON WOMEN AND BOOKS.</HEAD>
<P>THE Oracle began with the&s;e words: I commence with ob&s;erving, &s;ir, that books are <HI>atrocious.</HI> They are, in general, &s;o much <HI>above</HI> or <HI>below</HI> life, that either way one can expect no truth. <HI>Common-&s;en&s;e</HI> is thought too dull, and all <HI>other</HI> &s;en&s;e is &s;o u&s;ele&s;s, that, I &s;hould be glad to know, what can keep the pre&s;&s;es in employment? Why, &s;ir, nothing but fancy, and folly, and <HI>fine</HI> &s;en&s;e, which, I a&s;&s;ert once more, is <HI>no</HI> &s;en&s;e at all. This being my notion of books in general, you will judge
<PB N="52" REF="62">what it is of romances in particular. Romances, &s;ir, I define to be of all atro|cious things the <HI>mo&s;t</HI> atrocious, be|cau&s;e they de&s;cribe matters that never were, and, I hope to heaven, never <HI>will</HI> be. This being the ca&s;e, it fol|lows that very few books ought to be either printed or read; and of all books I &s;et down that &s;ame Millenium-Hall as containing the greate&s;t &s;hare of things impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Here I frowned.</P>
<P>Frown as you will, &s;ir, it behoves me to &s;ay (&s;ince my opinion is a&s;ked) I can prove <HI>that</HI> romance to be im|practicable in its fir&s;t &s;etting out. Why, &s;ir, the fir&s;t principle is <HI>atrocious.</HI> Do you think that Mi&s;s Man&s;ell, and Mi&s;s Morgan, Lady M. Jones, Mrs. Selvyn, Mrs. Trentham, and all the
<PB N="53" REF="63">other Lady Bountifuls, could live together in the &s;ame hou&s;e without <HI>lovers, hu&s;bands,</HI> or <HI>quarrels?</HI> Sir, &s;ir, &s;ir, you mu&s;t be exceedingly atrocious in the knowledge of women not to know that this is altogether out of nature.</P>
<P>I bit my lips.</P>
<P>That may be, &s;ir, (replied Samuel, &s;ticking to his point) but I am &s;ure mi&s;takes would every day, not to &s;ay, every <HI>hour,</HI> happen, to &s;et this <HI>Attic School,</HI> as you call it, in an uproar. I remember very well the pretty po&s;|tures in which they are de&s;cribed <HI>&s;it|ting in the book;</HI> but bring them out of that book into real life, and I would engage for an alteration. If you, &s;ir, knew the &s;ex when <HI>&s;hut up
<PB N="54" REF="64">together</HI> under the &s;ame roof, you would be &s;urpri&s;ed at the impudence of a fellow who would tell you of their living in harmony for &s;uch a number of years. No, no; times and &s;ea&s;ons would come about, if you were <HI>with</HI> them, when Mrs. Maynard would throw her orrery at Mrs. Selvyn, who, like a true woman, would throw her book at Mrs. Maynard, Mrs. Man&s;ell, notwith&s;tanding her being the fine&s;t form, and albeit, had beautiful brown hair, would to&s;s her Madona at Mrs. Trentham's carved figure, and away, I warrant you, would go that &s;ame carved work to knock off the beautiful brown-haired Mrs. Man&s;ell's Madona.</P>
<P>Prithee, dear &s;ir, if you mean that your new town &s;hould la&s;t till the
<PB N="55" REF="65">bricks are cemented, do not put half a dozen ladies of &s;pirit in any part of it together. He pau&s;ed, and then went on.</P>
<P>They may do very well, &s;ir, in a romance, (like your Millenium-Hall) but to introduce them upon <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green</HI> would put all Wales in confu|&s;ion. No, no, we will build better than that too. Our village &s;hall be of another gue&s;s con&s;truction.&mdash;No Maynards and Man&s;ells.</P>
<P>This la&s;t remark re-in&s;tated the &s;aga|cious Mr. Samuel in perfect favour. It looked like giving a little into my project, and through that acquie&s;cence were my affections now to be taken.</P>
<P>I arrived, in due &s;ea&s;on, at my e&s;tate, and received the homage of
<PB N="56" REF="66">my Welch tenants. It was the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the next morning to in&s;pect the wa&s;te-ground alluded to, and we found it the very be&s;t &s;pot in the world for <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green.</HI></P>

In the centre was to be a pe|de&s;tal and &s;tatue erected to the me|mory of <HI>Shen&s;tone;</HI> there was to be a pari&s;h church; and the hou&s;es were to be accurately alike.

<P>Such was the &s;chemer's di&s;patch, that he was ready for the re&s;t of the artificers in a trice, and all hands went merrily to work. No language
<PB N="61" REF="71">can expre&s;s the trembling joy with which I laid <HI>my&s;elf</HI> the fir&s;t &s;tone and brick for the building of <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green.</HI> In the very in&s;tant it was doing, I con&s;idered my&s;elf as about to rai&s;e a <HI>Temple to Genero&s;ity.</HI> The quantity of beef and beer given away on this occa&s;ion might have deluged the hone&s;ty of five hundred freehold|ers at an Engli&s;h election. The arti|ficers told me that unle&s;s the ground was well watered, or, to &s;peak more properly, well <HI>beered,</HI> no future crops of felicity were to be expected. To prevent, therefore, all misfortunes of this nature, carpenters, ma&s;ons, and even the &s;chemer him&s;elf got &s;o tho|roughly intoxicated for the future honour and pro&s;perity of <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green,</HI> that until three days after the
<PB N="62" REF="72">debauch, not a finger could wag in the way of its profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In due time, however, the hour of &s;obriety returned, and I had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee every body in earne&s;t. Help me to de&s;cribe the bli&s;s, ye children of Hope and Imagination&mdash; ye who have built <HI>your</HI> ca&s;tles in the clouds&mdash;help to &s;ay, how I rejoiced at the pro&s;pect of &s;o much generous labour! More than fifty times a-day did I walk round and round the &s;pace allotted for the village, &s;topping a-while at every ten yards to indulge the effu&s;ions of my enthu&s;ia&s;m. <HI>Here,</HI> perhaps, &s;aid I, in this &s;pot, may, by and by, re&s;ide one of my be&s;t friends, now pining in poverty. On this bar|ren heath, which hath hitherto re|&s;ounded
<PB N="63" REF="73">only with the noi&s;e of goats, &s;hall echo the happy conver|&s;ation of human beings. Flowers &s;hall u&s;urp the place now occupied by brambles, and even religion &s;hall move, with &s;ainted &s;teps, over MY GREEN.</P>
<P>Though it was difficult to pa&s;s over the bricks, the lime, and the mortar, I congratulated my&s;elf very heartily on &s;uch little embarra&s;&s;ments. This confu&s;ion, &s;aid I, touching my &s;tew|ard on the &s;houlder&mdash;this confu&s;ion, Samuel, ari&s;es not from the de&s;ola|tion of conque&s;t. The heaps of rub|bi&s;h which impede our pa&s;&s;age <HI>here,</HI> are not created by the ruins of &s;ome fair city, which hath fallen the victim of a military fury, who magnifies
<PB N="64" REF="74">murther into patrioti&s;m.&mdash;No, Mr. Steward; every brick that you now behold &s;hall be pre&s;ently converted to the purpo&s;es of benevolence. Tho&s;e waggons are laden with the materials of future happine&s;s.

<P>The hor&s;es, &s;ir, &s;aid Samuel, are very much obliged to you; &s;o, if you plea&s;e, we will withdraw to the man&s;ion-hou&s;e, where I have &s;ome|thing to &s;how your Honour.</P>

<P>That building is &s;urely large enough &s;ir, to fill with families that do not properly belong to you. There is

<P>Well, and what then, Mr. Samuel Sarca&s;m? &s;aid I. I could freely have taken his &s;tick to thra&s;h him.</P>
<P>Why then, Sir Benjamin Beauchamp, replied he, I would humbly advi&s;e that you turn out all the men, hor&s;es, bricks, and other <HI>materials of bene|volence</HI> from <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green,</HI> and &s;uf|fer kine to brow&s;e the thi&s;tle and to nip the gra&s;s, till you &s;ee whether it <HI>an&s;wers</HI> to proceed.

<P>I was on the edge of a reply to this propo&s;al, when the projector
<PB N="69" REF="79">came running to acquaint me of a new improvement.&mdash;I immediately told him of Samuel's plan, and did not fail to mix it up with a decent degree of ridicule.</P>
<P>The projector bur&s;t into &s;uch an immoderate degree of laughter, that I could not help joining him, and Samuel coughed again with color. There was more wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s in Samuel's cough than the pro|jector's laughter.</P>

<P>This was &s;uch a reflexion on the more noble views of my &s;oul, that I con&s;idered the &s;teward too abject at that time for my re&s;entment; and, therefore, collecting together all the coolne&s;s of philo&s;ophy, even in the mid&s;t of a poetical pur&s;uit, I told him I thought his adverti&s;ements were ju&s;t what I expected from <HI>his elegant</HI> pen, and that the &s;ooner he com|mitted them to the pre&s;s, the better.

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. THE PROPRIETORS WEAKNESS AND SINGULARITY.</HEAD>
<P>IN the mean time the builders went bri&s;kly on, and in a few months, a very goodly &s;how of hou&s;es began to promi&s;e the future completion of my hopes. No &s;ooner did the heath begin to a&s;&s;ume the look of a town, than I &s;urveyed it with &s;elf-congra|tulation. As I never &s;uffered my imagination to be cooled, either by the idea of expence or by the &s;ar|ca&s;tic &s;trokes of my &s;teward, it kindled every day into more ardour, and, I very well remember, my heart was &s;o full when I &s;aw the project nearly concluded, that I retired into
<PB N="77" REF="87">a &s;hady walk, which &s;ome adjacent poplars afforded me, and bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>Ah! what a voluptuous moment! Ah! what tears were the&s;e! repre|&s;ent to your&s;elf, reader, a man who&s;e fancy was embelli&s;hed with the mo&s;t exalted and amiable views.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid I, it is now time to look about me. I have made a vil|lage. How plea&s;ing the axe, the chi&s;&s;el, and mallet, echo one another! there is &s;omething generous in the &s;ound. Scarce had this idea pa&s;&s;ed, before I beheld one of the workmen dragging along a &s;ledge with free|&s;tone and marble, ready poli&s;hed, for the inferior parts of &s;ome of my buildings. The big drops of labour
<PB N="78" REF="88">cour&s;ed down his forehead, and at every dozen yards he &s;topped a little to breathe and to gather &s;trength. As the next pau&s;e he made was with|in a few paces of me, I &s;aw plainly his &s;ituation. The veins of his face and neck &s;eemed to di&s;tend with the force of pulling&mdash;the mu&s;cles of an athletic man looked to be bur&s;ting. It is amazing to think what I felt!&mdash; Poor fellow, &s;aid I advancing, thou art a good &s;oul I am &s;ure; at the &s;ame time my heart urged me to carry my handkerchief to his forehead, and to wipe away the &s;weat.</P>
<Q>"I could have hugged the grea&s;y rogue, He plea&s;ed me," reader.</Q>
<P>As to that, ma&s;ter, &s;aid the la|bourer, it don't &s;ignify; I always
<PB N="79" REF="89">&s;weats; but if your Honour would give us a drop of the dear creature, I &s;hould like it much better than a wipe of the face with a white hanker|chief. Odds bobs, &s;ir, we have a heavy batch of bu&s;ine&s;s at the <HI>Green</HI> yonder.</P>
<P>The dear creature &s;hall be much at your &s;ervice as &s;oon as I can fetch it from the man&s;ion-hou&s;e; but at pre&s;ent a little re&s;t will be not ami&s;s, &s;o &s;it down under the&s;e trees, and let us talk.</P>
<P>By chance I had, in a &s;ide-pocket, a half-pint fla&s;k of cordials, which I &s;ometimes carried in ca&s;e of accidents like the pre&s;ent. Before the preced|ing &s;peech, therefore, was fini&s;hed, I recollected this circum&s;tance, and pro|duced it to view. The change in the
<PB N="80" REF="90">man's features at &s;ight of the fla&s;k was remarkable enough. Lord, &s;ir, &s;aid he, licking his lips, what a good gentleman you are&mdash;don't you find it <HI>nation</HI> hot, &s;ir? Oh! what a plea|&s;ant &s;ight is one of your narrow-necked, gluck, glucking gentry, when a man is a-dry.</P>
<P>I gave him the bottle, which was in a moment glued to his lips; and after he had drank, he &s;at upon the gra&s;s, and the following conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed between us.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid the man, (&s;haking the brick-du&s;t from his &s;hirt) I have long wi&s;hed for the honour of talking with you, and I am glad, through your Honour's goodne&s;s, that I have got this opportunity. I am poor but hone&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="91">Speak freely <HI>hone&s;t</HI> friend, then.</P>
<P>Why then, &s;ir, about this &s;ame <HI>Shin&s;tun-Green.</HI>&mdash;Is it really a <HI>factotum</HI> that you are putting your&s;elf to all this charge for other folks? The talk goes among&s;t the ma&s;ons and brick|layers that you de&s;ign to give away hou&s;e, and land, and money, almo&s;t to any man that is poor and hone&s;t.</P>
<P>The report is true.</P>
<P>And won't you really think better on't, and give them the bite, &s;ir? Will your Honour go thorough &s;titch with this affair?</P>
<P>Why &s;hould you doubt me?</P>
<P><HI>Beca&s;e,</HI> &s;ir, I have my rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>Name them.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="92">Why here have I been ma&s;on's man and ma&s;ter ma&s;on going on of twenty years, and worked in that time for gentle and &s;imple, yet never heard of &s;uch an honourable man as your Honour in my life. Look ye, &s;ir, our bu&s;ine&s;s goes on in a regular channel. A man comes to me and &s;ays, Ma&s;ter Hewit, or Henry, or Mr. Henry Hewit, I want a hou&s;e built, or a wall run up, or &s;ome &s;uch matter. Upon that I takes my bag of work-tools, and goes to the place, where I fini&s;hes my jobb for &s;o much the piece or &s;o much the day. But fir&s;t I tries to get as much as I can for my work, and my employer tries, on his &s;ide, to get my work as cheap as po&s;&s;ible. My bargain being once &s;truck, I mu&s;t abide by it; and let
<PB N="83" REF="93">the &s;un burn my guts out, not a nog|ging of drink <HI>extra</HI> would be given to &s;ave'em</P>
<P>Drink, friend; pray drink.</P>
<P>Di&s;cour&s;e, to be &s;ure, heats; &s;o here's to your extraordinary Honour's health. Well, &s;ir, jobb being fini&s;hed, we &s;eparate; my ma&s;ter pays me growlingly, and goes into the hou&s;e I have built. Now here lies the difference: you give us all our own fair price, and pay chearfully for <HI>extra,</HI> and in&s;tead of going into the hou&s;e your&s;elf, you clap in a family who &s;hall perhaps be found &s;kulking under the hedges. Odds bobs, &s;ir, if a poor body &s;hould but make water again&s;t the walls of <HI>other</HI> people that I have worked for&mdash;yes, and &s;ub&s;tan|tial
<PB N="84" REF="94">folks too&mdash;whew they would be &s;ent to pri&s;on directly.</P>
<P>That is cruel.</P>
<P>Cruel, your Honour&mdash;why I tell you you are a non&s;uch. I am a good judge. Look ye, &s;ir, I was build|ing up Sir James Ranter's chimney|piece, and a block of marble fell, and lent me &s;uch a &s;liver as broke my arm&mdash;there's a &s;car for you. Well&mdash; I got two &s;hillings for this &s;troke from Sir James, and two and twenty damns from the ma&s;ter-bricklayer, who there|withal di&s;charged me for being care|le&s;s. But when I think of this, &s;ir, my tongue cleaves to the roof of my mouth with revenge; it really makes me dry again. One little drop more, if you plea&s;e, &s;ir.</P>
<P>With plea&s;ure&mdash;drink heartily.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="95">And &s;o, &s;ir, you <HI>will</HI> act in con|tradiction to all the world? You will be a friend to the friendle&s;s?</P>
<P>I will.</P>
<P>Then am I a &s;ad &s;coundril to wa&s;te my time here in talking, when I might be better employed, &s;aving your Honour's remarkable pre&s;ence, and when the &s;ooner the work is done the better.</P>
<P>Saying this, the man ro&s;e up abruptly, made his bows, and ran off with his &s;ledge of marble blocks as if they were &s;o many feathers.</P>
<P>A mighty action I &s;hall make of it after all, &s;aid I; here is a poor fellow who labours in the cau&s;e, and wi&s;hes to fini&s;h the work, though his
<PB N="86" REF="96">own intere&s;t depends on its continu|ance.</P>
<P>As I reflected on this matter, I re|gretted that a long <HI>habit of doing no|thing, i. e.</HI> living like a gentleman, had made it impo&s;&s;ible for me to work my&s;elf and pay others at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>So then, &s;aid I, all the merit I can claim upon this occa&s;ion is making a decent u&s;e of a large fortune, which came to me by inheritance, without any effort on my part. From this moment I looked on the multitude of workmen, which were variou&s;ly employed, as more &s;olid benefactors than my&s;elf. Whether I ever had rea&s;on to change my opinion will be &s;een pre&s;ently. All things in their order.</P>

<P>My hand trembled all the time I read this petition, but re&s;olved to treat it as a je&s;t, at lea&s;t in the pre|&s;ence of Samuel, I affected to &s;mile, and demanded who might be the pen|man of this plea&s;ant thing.

<P>And what is your opinion of my ca&s;e, Mr. Edward Elixir, apothecary, &s;urgeon, &amp;c.? And pray who told you, that your abilities were requi&s;ite at my hou&s;e, Mr. Edward Elixir, &s;urgeon, apothecary, &amp;c.?</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="110">Mr. Philip Flouri&s;h, the carver, &s;ir, he came to me about an hour ago, as I was eradicating a tooth of Taff Toughjaw, my neighbour. Sir, &s;aid he, I come to you in behalf of our patron at the man&s;ion-hou&s;e. We have &s;ome rea&s;ons, which would be no &s;ecrets, were we to tell them to an apothecary.&mdash;You know Mr. Flouri&s;h, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;ir&mdash;We have &s;ome rea&s;ons to think, he (our patron) is not quite in good health.

Take care con&s;umption; little Ed|ward is at hand.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="111">Here he clo&s;ed the lids, and ex|amined.</P>
<P>Ah&mdash;ah&mdash;have I got thee? Sir, <HI>that</HI> con&s;umption will I lay as flat as my forceps before it gets an inch forwarder. Sir, there is not a di&s;|order incident to man but is naturally and artificially afraid of Edward Elixir. It is a Welch proverb now-a-days, to &s;ay, in ca&s;e of a dangerous di&s;temper,
<Q>Elixir Ned Shall &s;trike thee dead.</Q></P>
<P>Pray, Mr. Elixir, &s;aid I, does the poet here mean the di&s;temper or the patient which is to be knocked dead?</P>
<P>Well now, if I could not die of laughing at the divine conceit of
<PB N="102" REF="112">that&mdash;if I could not, may pe&s;tilence get the better of me. How I do love to laugh&mdash;cur&s;e it and con&s;ume it how I do love to laugh. I wi&s;h, &s;ir, you had time to hear my hi&s;tory. I tell my hi&s;tory to every patient. Ha! ha! ha! ha! he! he! he!</P>
<P>They are <HI>patients</HI> in good truth, Mr. Elixir.</P>
<P>I &s;wear by my &s;ci&s;&s;ars you will kill me, &s;ir, if you go on in that manner. Wit tickles me wor&s;e than the point of a feather. Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! he! he!&mdash;Bright, bright, bright, bright, bright.</P>
<P>"Immoderate laughing, &s;ays the proverb, is catching." I joined the apothecary very heartily, without being able to a&s;&s;ign any other rea&s;on
<PB N="103" REF="113">than that of &s;eeing a little comical man in happy convul&s;ions.</P>
<P>When you recover, Mr. Elixir, &s;aid I, you will return to my con|&s;umption.</P>
<P>When I <HI>recover!</HI>&mdash;Je&s;us, Je&s;us, there's another blow at my poor lungs and &s;ides. Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! When I <HI>recover!</HI> Why, &s;ir, your di&s;temper &s;eems to be a &s;uper|abundant humour of wit. How I do love to laugh! But to return. Phy&s;ically &s;peaking, then, how do you find your&s;elf?</P>
<P>Phy&s;ically an&s;wering, I am morally &s;ick of your foolery. Lookee, Mr. Elixir, my workmen, and that Flou|ri&s;h you &s;peak of, have played me a prank I do not approve; and, if
<PB N="104" REF="114"><HI>you</HI> are made a party in it, I &s;hall be very much di&s;pea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Welchman's face changed in a moment, and he prote&s;ted he was a man of no &s;kill, if he knew any thing more of the matter than the carver had told him, and who&s;e words he had already repeated.</P>
<P>Upon the credit of this, I let him into the whole &s;tory, making him, at the &s;ame time, acquainted with all my de&s;igns, views, and pa&s;|&s;ions, in regard to <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green.</HI></P>
<P>I had no &s;ooner fini&s;hed my di&s;|cour&s;e, than this unaccountable man jumped &s;ix or &s;even inches from his chair, &s;kipped about the room, as &s;kippeth a goat over the mountains; and then, &s;haking my hand, till we
<PB N="105" REF="115">were both red in the face, he caught up his hat, without &s;aying a &s;yllable, and &s;et off from the hou&s;e on the full &s;tretch, running over the hills like a rabbit.</P>
<P>If thou goe&s;t by the way of <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green,</HI> &s;aid I to my&s;elf, and if, peradventure, any of the work|men &s;ee thee, then will they &s;wear the doctor is ten times madder than the patient.</P>
<P>This prophecy was really fulfil|led; for, in le&s;s than three quarters of an hour, a party of the builders, armed with the in&s;truments of their trade, had caught up the mi&s;erable apothecary, and were e&s;corting him to the man&s;ion-hou&s;e, that, <HI>there,</HI> mea&s;ures might be taken to &s;end him home to his family in peace.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="116">I no &s;ooner appeared at the door, in order to enquire the cau&s;e of this &s;ingular confu&s;ion, than the di&s;a&s;trous &s;urgeon began to &s;kip, and bound and &s;nap his fingers over his head, and &s;ing forth his Welch ditties, with more vigour than ever; but what was, at that time, more ridi|culous &s;till, the workmen &s;eemed to &s;tand aloof, as if afraid to advance.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends and fellow-workmen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SUFFER me to tell in the be&s;t language I am able, wherefore we are a&s;&s;embled:</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="117">Noble Sir Benjamin Beauchamp! you are our patron, and therein do we bear unto you re&s;pect. Hear me, therefore, for my cau&s;e; and do you, carpenters and joiners, be &s;ilent that I may be heard. Cen&s;ure me in your wi&s;dom, &s;ir, and awaken tho&s;e &s;en&s;es which we fear you have lo&s;t, that you may the better judge. If there be any in this a&s;&s;embly that is the dear friend of Sir Benjamin Beauchamp, to him I &s;ay that Phil. Flouri&s;h's love to Sir Benjamin is no le&s;s than his. If then that friend demand why Brutus, I mean Philip Flouri&s;h, ro&s;e again&s;t our Cae&s;ar, that is to &s;ay, Sir Benjamin Beauchamp, this, in the name of all the work-men, is my an&s;wer:&mdash;Not that we loved Sir Benjamin le&s;s, but that we
<PB N="108" REF="118">love our honour more. As Sir Ben|jamin loves us, I weep for him; as he is throwing away his fortune, I am &s;orry for it; as he is a worthy gentleman, I honour him; but as he &s;eems to be out of his own &s;en&s;es, and can put other folks (as this poor apothecary, for in&s;tance) out of their's, we are afraid to come near him. Thus, &s;ir, there are fears for your lo&s;s of wits, honour for your good|ne&s;s, and &s;orrow for your &s;ituation. Who's here &s;o ba&s;e that would not work for Sir Benjamin Beauchamp? Who's here &s;o rude that would pick his pocket? Who's here &s;o vile that does not pity this poor apothecary? I pau&s;e for a reply.</P>
<P>Mr. Philip Flouri&s;h having fini&s;hed his harangue, in the tragic &s;tyle, I
<PB N="109" REF="119">learned from a le&s;s rhetorical quarter, <HI>i. e.</HI> from the lips of Mr. Samuel Sar|ca&s;m, that the pre&s;ent noi&s;e had been occa&s;ioned by the conduct of Mr. Ed|ward Elixir, who, on his departure from the man&s;ion-hou&s;e, ran upon the <HI>Green</HI> and jumped about, &s;aying &s;uch extravagant things about my genero|&s;ity, my wit, and my fine &s;en&s;e, ac|companying all the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions with &s;uch je&s;tures as very fairly gave rea|&s;on for the workmen to imagine there was &s;omething <HI>contageous</HI> in my di&s;order, the wor&s;t part of which had been, as they pre&s;umed, caught by the apothecary.</P>
<P>To cru&s;h all the&s;e fooleries and fal&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions by one deci&s;ive &s;troke, I took up the whole affair
<PB N="110" REF="120">on very &s;erious ground, and in&s;i&s;ted on being attended to.</P>
<P>I repre&s;ented this to the gentle|men as very ill behaviour. With regard to their petition, I ob&s;erved, that I was willing to &s;ee it in the mo&s;t favourable light; but, what|ever I had done, or might do, de|pended on my own plea&s;ure, for which I cho&s;e to pay in proportion. That <HI>their</HI> part of the bu&s;ine&s;s was, peaceably to pur&s;ue each man his particular avocation till the work was fini&s;hed. That it was <HI>imperti|nent</HI> to enquire for what particular u&s;e I rai&s;ed up to my&s;elf a town. It was for them to do <HI>&s;o much work,</HI> agreeable to my directions, for <HI>&s;o much money;</HI> and that, if I cho&s;e
<PB N="111" REF="121">to build a palace for a parcel of hor&s;es, and put my friends in a pig-&s;tye, it was wholly my affair, and not theirs. The apothecary, Mr. Elixir, had been, I ob&s;erved, &s;ent by Mr. Flouri&s;h on a fooli&s;h errand; namely, to cure a man who was in perfect health; and that, as to his jumping about for joy, in talking of me, it might be partly from the vivacity of his con&s;titution, and partly from the goodne&s;s of his heart, at hearing there was a man who had the <HI>courage</HI> to proceed in erecting a town to &s;erve the Unfor|tunate, when it was found to be &s;o very contrary to the &s;ordid maxims of the world, that even the work-men were up in arms.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="122">This being a full explanation; I added, that I expected matters would go on regularly for the future, and that they would &s;o far enlarge their hearts, as to pur&s;ue their duty with a diligent chearfulne&s;s; and that, while they <HI>were</HI> pur&s;uing it, they &s;hould not think the wor&s;e of their patron's under&s;tanding for acting by them more generou&s;ly than &s;ome of their former employers.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ions of a mob are never fixed. The&s;e &s;illy people now ran into the other extreme, and were, by the foregoing &s;peech, &s;o fully &s;a|tisfied, that I was unanimou&s;ly ex|tolled as a paragon of &s;en&s;e and &s;olid learning; as charitable beyond the reach of in&s;tances, and as the
<PB N="113" REF="123">be&s;t ma&s;ter that ever was worked for.</P>
</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></Q>
<P>Hereupon they relea&s;ed the apo|thecary, of whom they demanded many pardons; and then after giving me three cheers, they went ha&s;tily away, convinced I was in full po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of my &s;en&s;es, and that they would now go to work for me like &s;o many devils.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. THE PROJECT BECOMES POPULAR.</HEAD>
<P>THUS was every thing accommo|dated, and <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green</HI> went on more bri&s;kly than ever. In truth, every man appeared to do his utmo&s;t, and the progre&s;s of this united effort, became in a &s;hort time &s;o apparent, that my village a&s;&s;umed a regularity and &s;plendour which attracted the curio&s;ity of the adjacent counties. Sir Benjamin's <HI>new town</HI> was a po|pular &s;ubject, and the echo of his good intentions reverberated from &s;hire to &s;hire.</P>
<P>Among&s;t others who had particu|larly contributed to this popularity,
<PB N="115" REF="125">was the little Welch doctor, men|tioned in the la&s;t chapter. This man was &s;o &s;truck with the novelty of the project, that he took care to blazon it forth through all the families into which his loquacity or his &s;kill could gain him acce&s;s; and a talkative creature of his character and profe&s;|&s;ion, in a dull part of the world too, where a little run-about thing &s;kips from mountain to mountain to pick up news, is always welcome in one &s;en&s;e or another. By &s;uch means, therefore, I was at once celebrated and delighted, for I will not attempt to conceal the &s;atisfaction I received from this innocent flattery, and it &s;o endeared to me, Mr. Elixir, (whom I looked upon as in a great mea&s;ure the &s;ource of it) that I cultivated his
<PB N="116" REF="126">acquaintance, and had him with me at the man&s;ion-hou&s;e almo&s;t every evening.</P>
<P>Now then it was that I began to think my &s;cheme in &s;ufficient for|wardne&s;s to give the finer and more affectionate fini&s;hes. The hou&s;es be|ing nearly completed, I imagined it time to think about getting them oc|cupied; and in the mean time I gave directions for &s;uch embelli&s;hments in point of gardening as might leave nothing undone that could add ele|gance to convenience. At an incre|dible charge I enriched a land, natu|rally unfruitful, till it was flowing with fragrance and breathing per|fume. Ro&s;es, je&s;&s;amines, pinks, honey|&s;uckles, and lillies, embroidered every
<PB N="117" REF="127">part, and, in the &s;pace of &s;ix months after the rubbi&s;h was removed, it would have been difficult to find in any part of Europe a &s;pot more agreeably cultivated, or more adorned with beauties artificial and natural than <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green.</HI></P>
<P>This then was the period to bring down fir&s;t my daughter, and then &s;uch of my friends as I thought would be mo&s;t happy in &s;uch an a&s;ylum. <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> is here <HI>regained,</HI> &s;aid I.</P>
<P>Matilda, in con&s;equence of the&s;e re&s;olutions, was with me in a few days, and the emotions of her &s;ur|prize, on her fir&s;t &s;ight of <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green,</HI> does &s;o much honour to hu|man nature, of which &s;he is an or|nament,
<PB N="118" REF="128">and of her father, who doats upon her, that it would rob the reader of entertainment, not to give them in her own language, ju&s;t as they were conveyed in a letter to a lady, who afterwards became, and indeed is to this hour, a pen&s;ioner.</P>

<P>WELL, dear Eliza, the la&s;t poli&s;hes are now giving to <HI>The Green.</HI> I am ju&s;t come from a fir&s;t view, and from walking round the enchanting circuit. The &s;oul of <HI>Shen&s;tone</HI> and of Sir <HI>Benjamin,</HI> &s;hines through every part. I was in this very &s;pot about two &s;um|mers ago, and remember it was impa&s;&s;ible by means of weeds and
<PB N="119" REF="129">nettles. It is now burni&s;hed with buildings, and blooming with flowers. The great beauty of the place, <HI>&s;imply</HI> con&s;idered, is &s;uff|cient to gratify the mo&s;t delicate ta&s;te; but, when one adds thereto the generous purpo&s;es for which that beauty has been preparing, and con&s;iders it is de&s;igned to be a paradi&s;e for di&s;tre&s;&s;ed virtue in every form; for merit &s;uperciliou&s;ly over looked; and for genius which is &s;purned by ignorance; its value ri&s;es &s;o on the imagination, that one is perfectly dazzled. I am &s;ure I am &s;o to the greate&s;t degree. The idea is &s;o delicious, &s;o peculiar, &s;o uncommon. There is nothing now wanting but the furniture. I do not mean chairs, gla&s;&s;es, tables,
<PB N="120" REF="130">for tho&s;e will be here in a few days, and are already ordered; but that <HI>nobler</HI> furniture of hone&s;t minds and generous hearts, made re&s;pect|able by calamity, and &s;acred from their misfortunes. Among&s;t the&s;e, my dear Elliot is invited as a valuable gue&s;t. She is invited to enjoy the independence and &s;e|renity which &s;he hath a right to claim, and which has &s;o long been her due. I have already, my dear, &s;elected for you a hou&s;e: it is embo&s;omed by lillies and ro&s;es that almo&s;t emulate your own com|plexion. It is in that quarter which lies neare&s;t to the wood, and will, therefore, be le&s;s liable to the cold air, and make it more agree|able
<PB N="121" REF="131">for walking. Here my Elliot &s;hall forget to &s;igh; or, if that cannot be, her &s;ighs &s;hall be bu|ried in the bo&s;om of a friend. Do not fear that any wrong curio&s;ity &s;hall be &s;et to work to extort from you that profound &s;ecret which you &s;o firmly re&s;olve to con|ceal. It will not be a maxim at <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green</HI> to oblige with one hand and violate with the other.

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. PETITION THE SECOND.</HEAD>
<P>ON the evening in which this letter was written, and &s;ent by a &s;ervant to the po&s;t-town, the &s;teward came once more into my room, with his &s;arca&s;tical face, (ju&s;t as Matilda and I were in high chit-chat upon the charms of our project) and begged an audience.</P>
<P>Speak, Samuel, &s;aid I, gayly. What! another petition, I &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
<P>Sir, replied Samuel, my office ob|liges me to lay before you &s;uch things as come to hand upon the &s;ubject of <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green.</HI> At pre&s;ent I bear
<PB N="124" REF="134">a petition, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed; but it moves upon &s;o different a prin|ciple, and is, indeed, in &s;o different a &s;tyle (being altogether a panegyric on your Honour's project), that I conceive it will have a different re|ception from the la&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. Samuel, &s;aid I, if it is in prai&s;e of a project, which, I think, cannot well be blamed, I de&s;ire to hear it; and, as I know you are not more of an <HI>oracle</HI> than an <HI>orator,</HI> pray &s;it down and be&s;tow on it all the graces of your delivery.</P>
<P>Grey locks are no &s;ecurities again&s;t the force of flattery, which we &s;wal|low upon almo&s;t any terms; even when the preparation is but bung|lingly made up. Thus, though this
<PB N="125" REF="135">compliment was equivocal, and equal|ly admitted an interpretation of prai&s;e and cen&s;ure, Mr. Samuel Sarca&s;m, old and arch, and white headed as he was, took it in the mo&s;t &s;oothing &s;en&s;e, and was put into perfect good humour.</P>
<P>Now for it, cried Matilda.</P>
<P>Samuel unfolded a paper, which, as u&s;ual, he had plaited very metho|dically, and, &s;itting down in front, exerted him&s;elf in giving all po&s;&s;ible empha&s;is to what follows:</P>

<P>THAT, your petitioners a&s;k ten thou&s;and pardons for ever having &s;uppo&s;ed you were hurt in your &s;en&s;es; but a&s;&s;ure your Honour, they judged only from the difficulty they had to believe any man, in his right rea&s;on, could be a friend to tho&s;e whom almo&s;t all the world agree to de|&s;pi&s;e; and whom they, therefore, thought

<P>It was not without a mixture of anger, plea&s;ure, and indignation, that I could &s;uffer Samuel to go through this curious catalogue. Matilda fairly gave way to her youth, and

His &s;orrow was as violent as his joy; and as he &s;kipped about in many antick po&s;tures, (for no chair could keep him &s;itting while he was under the influence of his feel|ings) he called goats and gods to witne&s;s that, if that man's cottage &s;hould be vi&s;ited by all the plagues of Egypt, he would drive them all out <HI>gratis.</HI> Yes, &s;aid he, I am a gla&s;s bottle if I would not bleed, bolus, and bli&s;ter a dog which be|longed to that fellow for nothing; yea, though I lo&s;t half my paying-cu&s;tomers in the mean time.

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. MR. ELIXIR, THE APOTHECARY, RE|LATES THE HEADS OF HIS STORY.</HEAD>
<P>FEW evenings of any life were pa&s;&s;ed more agreeably than that which &s;ucceeded the receipt of Henry Hewit's well intended letter. The apothecary &s;taid the whole night, and enlivened the conver&s;ation by &s;uch &s;allies as tho&s;e who do not well know the immen&s;e variety there is in human character, can form no idea. Sir, &s;aid he, I will not &s;ay you &s;hall make a <HI>Shen&s;tonian</HI> of me; becau&s;e, though I do very well to hop over the hills, I am afraid I &s;hould make a &s;illy figure with a good hou&s;e and two hundred a-year; unle&s;s, indeed, you
<PB N="141" REF="151">would give me the bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>Green</HI> in the way of my profe&s;&s;ion; in which ca&s;e, Death &s;hould not often &s;how his ugly face, I warrant him; but, however, as we have half an hour to &s;pare, I will let you a little into the light of my pre&s;ent &s;ituation.</P>
<P>This was extremely acceptable to us, and Mr. Elixir began: I had never a regular education, &s;ir, and my parents went to heaven before I commenced the practice of phy&s;ic; otherwi&s;e, they might, per|haps, have been living upon earth &s;till&mdash;but they lo&s;t that ble&s;&s;ing for want of my not being born &s;ooner. I was at fir&s;t a corn-cutter, and from thence I got the &s;ecret for cur|ing &s;welled ancles. White-&s;wellings in the knee were the things which
<PB N="142" REF="152">next celebrated me&mdash;for away flew the tumours at the touch of my emo|lient. My next advance was to re|lieve ladies in certain circum&s;tances, and &s;ome of the fine&s;t per&s;ons in Wales are of my bringing forth. After this, I formed and invented a medicine which removed all pains of the &s;tomach, back, and loins; which no&s;trum was, I &s;oon perceived, equally good for &s;orene&s;s in the brea&s;t. In the next &s;tep, I invented a lenient to take wax and cornels from the neck. Then I &s;ent away coughs. Then I conquered the tooth-ach; and, la&s;tly, I found out the invaluable art of making the hair grow. Thus, &s;ir, in regular proce&s;s and progre&s;s, I mounted, by the mere force of ap|plication and &s;trong natural abilities, from the heel to the head; and now,
<PB N="143" REF="153">thank God, I am at the head of my profe&s;&s;ion&mdash;for I as often pre&s;cribe as make up; not, between our&s;elves, that I think my genius for phy&s;ic hath half &s;o good an effect upon my patients as my humour and my good nature; for I am one of tho&s;e, but I mu&s;t not tell to the world, you know&mdash;I am one of tho&s;e, who think half the maladies of mankind ari&s;e from melancholy, and that nature is, in generous tempers, generally to be laughed out of her megrims. Thus I make it a rule to give innocent things&mdash;that is to &s;ay, I deal altoge|ther in <HI>&s;imples,</HI> and made the patient forget his pain as much as po&s;&s;ible. But there is one part of my character which has always &s;tood in my way&mdash; Whenever I &s;ee people in real mi&s;ery,
<PB N="144" REF="154">I have not been able to keep my countenance, but fall incontinently to weeping, ju&s;t as I did at Hewit's letter; in which di&s;tre&s;s I have &s;o much &s;atisfaction, that, though it makes me as lean and meagre as one of my &s;keletons, I am more con|tented than a prince. On the other hand, I have very often an oppor|tunity to bring up my fle&s;h again by contrary emotions; for if, either by &s;tratagem or by nature, I can once &s;et my patients to laughing, their cure is certain, and they have no more to fear. At any rate, I am a very in|offen&s;ive little fellow, and pick up a goodi&s;h income for me and my wife, whom, as I hope to be &s;aved, &s;ir, I married becau&s;e &s;he has my faculty of laughing, and will &s;it oppo&s;ite to
<PB N="145" REF="155">me in her arm chair (which, God ble&s;s her, &s;he fills bur&s;ting full) and titters at nothing by the hour toge|ther. Oh! &s;he's a &s;en&s;ible woman, &s;ir; and though &s;he is &s;o lu&s;ty, I am fain to trundle her about the parlour for exerci&s;e; &s;he does make &s;uch fine remarks on medicine and on human nature, and on the growth of the hu|man hair, that, if I were a penman, I would put her down for publica|tion. What a capital volume in <HI>folio</HI> would my wife be! Even in <HI>&s;heets</HI> &s;he cuts a very re&s;pectable figure, I pre&s;ume Mr. Elixir, &s;aid I.</P>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! replyed the apothecary.</P>
<P>Mr. Elixir was now again &s;et in for the above ha! ha! ha! diver&s;ion,
<PB N="146" REF="156">and to&s;&s;ed him&s;elf from chair to chair, panting and fuming with his convul|&s;ion, for near twenty minutes. Oh! various Nature; how do&s;t thou &s;port with us thy little creatures!</P>
<P>After this, Elixir &s;poke.</P>
<P>We live, I &s;ay &s;ir, comfortably; but I am not ab&s;olutely in the riche&s;t part, you know, of the habitable globe, and my cu&s;tomers who pay, are in no proportion to tho&s;e who do not pay. The truth is, I will cure a man at any time if he will but either laugh or cry with me; and, as I have taken notice tho&s;e are the two matters mo&s;t in practice in this world, I think I &s;tand a good chance to be &s;upplied. Yet I mu&s;t tell you, that though I choo&s;e always
<PB N="147" REF="157">to laugh in <HI>company,</HI> I had always a thou&s;and times rather cry <HI>alone.</HI></P>
<P>Odds &s;o, odds &s;o, that's true (&s;aid he, recollecting him&s;elf) I have a poor thing that I mu&s;t &s;ee to-night, and &s;he lives full a mile from hence. She mu&s;t not be weeping in her bed, while I am telling you a hi&s;tory that is not worth &s;ix-pence. Be&s;ides, &s;he is poor.</P>
<P>Upon this our ma&s;ter of phy&s;ic &s;prung up, and hurried out, in the middle of as dark and rainy night, as, in <HI>Summer,</HI> could po&s;&s;ibly be.</P>
<P>God be with thee poor fellow, &s;aid I, go where thou wilt! May Provi|dence keep every &s;torm from thy heart!</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="158">That he will, papa, replied Ma|tilda, you may depend upon it. Here my daughter took out her pocket-book and pencil. What are you writing Matilda, &s;aid I? Only the names of per&s;ons whom I re|commend to you as proper, &s;ir, for <HI>The Green.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. MR. SAMUEL SARCASM, THE STEWARD, SETS OUT ON A REMARKABLE JOURNEY.</HEAD>
<P>I WAITED now only for the ap|proach of the next Spring (which was advancing) to people my new village. The workmen were all paid off and di&s;charged, except John Sawe, the worthy exception made by Henry Hewit, and &s;ome few others, who were retained as traders in the &s;ervice of <HI>The Green.</HI> But the mo&s;t delicate and embarra&s;&s;ing part of the bu&s;ine&s;s yet remained; this was, to announce my intentions to the nece&s;|&s;itous and unhappy, in &s;uch a <HI>man|ner,</HI> as might offer protection unac|companied by in&s;ult. Here was a
<PB N="150" REF="160">nice point. I was effectually puzzled. The &s;teward advi&s;ed, that I &s;hould di&s;tribute a printed hand-bill, in the way of, <Q>Walk in, gentlemen, walk in, to <HI>give way&mdash;The Green.</HI></Q> At another time, he recommended me to place over the doors &s;ome large &s;igns, either of wood or metal, with the following in&s;cription for the u&s;e of travellers: <Q>Entertainment and an annuity, for man and hor&s;e, here, GRATIS.</Q> But the&s;e &s;arca&s;ms, you may be &s;ure, I avoided. They were among&s;t the waggeries woven into that hone&s;t man's con&s;titution; and &s;o, in con&s;ideration of his other good qualities, I forgave him. Matilda was of opinion, that being for pub|lic utility, the adverti&s;ement could not be too general; and, therefore,
<PB N="151" REF="161">advi&s;ed the mode of the <HI>News-papers.</HI> But this did not &s;eem to me &s;uffici|ently <HI>delicate.</HI> After much delibera|tion, I re&s;olved upon the following method, out of many others which &s;eemed to be le&s;s plau&s;ible, viz. That Samuel &s;hould be &s;ent with circular letters from me to all my friends, in capital &s;ituations, to recommend &s;uch of their humble or unhappy ac|quaintance, as might, upon their ex|perience, de&s;erve a protection in <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green;</HI> and al&s;o, that the like project &s;hould be &s;econded by Matilda in the letters which <HI>&s;he</HI> &s;hould &s;end over town and country at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>One fair morning therefore, pre|parations having been made, Mr.
<PB N="152" REF="162">Samuel Sarca&s;m clapped the &s;addle|bags acro&s;s his favourite pad, and was as well laden with letters as any mail what&s;oever. But, he had not been ab&s;ent three days before we received from him the following epi&s;tle:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>To Sir</HI> B. BEAUCHAMP. SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LOOKING upon it that I am charged with &s;uch a commi&s;&s;ion as no &s;teward had ever before in tru&s;t, I am willing it &s;hould be &s;o done as to hand down my name to po&s;|terity in a way to do it honour. Being now, as I take it, on the road of immortality, it behoveth me not to &s;tumble. It is to this end that I am baiting my hor&s;e at
<PB N="153" REF="163">a hedge ale-hou&s;e, in my way to London, where mo&s;t of your letters are directed. The hor&s;e, I &s;ay, &s;ir, eateth while I write to know the <HI>full extent of my commi&s;&s;ion.</HI> I for|got to a&s;k certain particulars before I &s;et out; &s;o pray tell me if I am to go to London <HI>right on;</HI> or, whether I may make &s;uch excur|&s;ions as &s;eem to promi&s;e me, in the vagabond way, any &s;ucce&s;s? Am I to take notice of any ragged tatterdemallions that I may meet, overtake, or follow upon the road&mdash; &s;uch as beggars, gyp&s;ies, &amp;c.&mdash;or am I to let them alone? I have al|ready pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal very ill-looking fellows, and as many dirty hu&s;&s;eys, who, I verily believe, would not refu&s;e to become our pen&s;ioners.
<PB N="154" REF="164">There was particularly a man with a &s;hock head of hair, and two wooden legs, who acco&s;ted me ye&s;|terday, in God's name, to give him a &s;hilling. By the &s;plendour of his demand, (being eleven times more than ordinary beggars have the im|pudence to a&s;k) I am per&s;uaded he would like to lay his &s;tumps upon <HI>The Green.</HI> If I had given him any encouragement, he would certainly have undertaken to hop to you in about forty eight hours; nay, he worked away upon his timber ten or a dozen paces to &s;how me how he could move; but I have let him &s;lip through my fingers. If you think he is a prize, &s;ir, I will con|trive to pick him up and pack him in a cart; or, if your Honour
<PB N="155" REF="165">choo&s;es, in a coach, as I come back. Even in this pot-hou&s;e, (where I am u&s;ing the vile&s;t pen and mo&s;t polluted paper upon the mo&s;t virtuous &s;ubject) there are half a &s;core as pretty, that is to &s;ay, as ugly, objects for the pen|&s;ion as you could wi&s;h. I do not believe there are twelve ounces of whole&s;ome human fle&s;h among&s;t the ten; and, to all appearance, not above a &s;hirt and an half, were one to tack all their &s;lips of linen toge|ther. If the&s;e would not be glad of your Honour's patronage, I do not know who would. From what has been &s;aid then, &s;ir, you will perceive that I could get a number of recruits (and almo&s;t all &s;uch as are too frightful for any ho&s;pital

<PB N="158" REF="168">are &s;o charmed with your Honour's &s;cheme, that, in&s;tead of recom|mending <HI>others,</HI> they would, with very little per&s;ua&s;ion, accept of your offer <HI>them&s;elves.</HI> In &s;hort, &s;ir, I have in the cour&s;e of this original journey &s;een more of the world than I ever &s;aw in all the former parts of my life. Yet I knew men before. Why London <HI>is</HI> a &s;ort of <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green</HI>&mdash;I mean, &s;ir, the court quarter&mdash;and the King of England is only another Sir Benjamin Beauchamp. His Maje&s;ty, like your Honour, pro|videth his fine folks with a hou&s;e and an annuity for&mdash;<HI>doing nothing;</HI> and they are &s;o tired with the fatigue of that employment, that I &s;ee plainly they would turn them|&s;elves
<PB N="159" REF="169">out of one place to catch at another, were it only for the exer|ci&s;e of changing a po&s;ture. I am in a de&s;perate quandary how to act; for, as I &s;aid before, two hundred pounds a-year, and a good hou&s;e, is an object with almo&s;t every man and woman to whom your Honour and Mi&s;s Matilda &s;ent letters. On one &s;core or another, they find rea|&s;ons to baffle all my endeavours to recommend, by their means, the unfortunate, and intreat my intere&s;t on their <HI>own accounts.</HI> Had I been a man who liked dirty money as well as clean money, &s;ir, I could have made this tour turn out very decently, for &s;everal brilliant bribes have been held up between mine hone&s;ty and my avarice. It is two
<PB N="160" REF="170">months &s;ince from day to day I have been put off by the&s;e your <HI>great</HI> friends, &s;ir, on the &s;olemn promi&s;e of receiving a catalogue of proper objects when I next called; but I am as far off as ever, except that I have picked up a couple of gentlemen, whom I think may do, and whom I &s;hall &s;end down by the &s;tage to <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green.</HI> You have been &s;orely mi&s;taken, &s;ir, in your notion of the riches and &s;itua|tions of tho&s;e you wrote to; and I do not think you will be the better e&s;teemed for having thus, as it were, thrown out a lure, to get <HI>at the bottom of their circum&s;tances.</HI> It was a golden mi&s;take while you were in ignorance, &s;ir, but having once caught this &s;ecret, and, to &s;ay
<PB N="161" REF="171">the truth, <HI>trepanned</HI> them out of it, 'twill be a moot point whether you keep their good will or lo&s;e it. Ah! &s;ir, London connexions were not, I doubt, the proper ones to point out that kind of mode&s;t merit and ob&s;cure virtue which you want for <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green.</HI> I found all but one man (and of him I may &s;peak hereafter) in that &s;ort of dazzling hurry which prevented either his &s;eeing or hearing. One of your friends, &s;ir, at the time of my waiting upon him was bargain|ing for a trinket, which the vender valued at fifty guineas, and which the buyer de&s;igned, as he &s;aid, for a pre&s;ent to his mi&s;tre&s;s; while, at the other end of the room, &s;tood a poor fellow nipping his hat, and
<PB N="162" REF="172">&s;oliciting five guineas to pay his lodgings. How doth your Honour think this matter ended? Why the gentleman paid down the fifty gui|neas for the toy, and told the pe|titioner that he was out of ca&s;h ju&s;t then, but might call next week, or the week after. Underneath, &s;ir, are the &s;everal names of your <HI>great London friends,</HI> who are willing to accept of your Honour's protection, your hou&s;e, land, and money, to almo&s;t <HI>any amount.</HI></P>
<P>They in&s;i&s;t on my &s;ending down the li&s;t before I proceed; and as you will be&s;t judge your&s;elf, &s;ir, how far they are, or are not, ob|jects, I &s;hall not intrude any re|marks; but beg your Honour's

<P>I could not help feeling great &s;ur|prize and indignation as I read this li&s;t; for, &s;uch is the face that <HI>every one</HI> of tho&s;e per&s;ons put upon their circum&s;tances and their conduct, that they had for many years pa&s;&s;ed upon
<PB N="168" REF="178">me (who was their old country cor|re&s;pondent) as men of the fir&s;t for|tune and fa&s;hion. On comparing the pre&s;ent catalogue with that given in by the <HI>workmen,</HI> I could not but imagine, that the bricklayer, who fell from a ladder in the year 1717, the man who was much &s;ubject to corns, and the boy who over&s;et his barrow in the ditch (becau&s;e he was thick|&s;ighted) had infinitely more fair pre|tention to the pen&s;ions of <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green,</HI> than any of the&s;e honourable gentlemen, of who&s;e ways and means of exi&s;ting and wa&s;ting, I had been &s;o very long ignorant.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXI. SHENSTONE-GREEN IS NOT PEOPLED WITHOUT A GOOD DEAL OF TROUBLE.</HEAD>
<P>BY this time it appeared perfectly plain, that I mu&s;t depend only on the care and diligence of a few other friends, who, on trial, were not liv|ing in a &s;tate of gay deception; and that, where &s;uch care and diligence failed, I mu&s;t tru&s;t to the effects of a public adverti&s;ement. I do a&s;&s;ure you, reader, it is more trouble&s;ome to get a town reputably populated, than to build it. This was &s;o &s;acred a truth, in my ca&s;e, that the middle of the Summer &s;hone off before I
<PB N="170" REF="180">could &s;ay <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green</HI> was pro|perly inhabited. Whether, indeed, it was <HI>ever</HI> properly inhabited, may admit of a doubt. However, I &s;hall not trouble the reader with any fur|ther delays on this point; but, cut|ting the di&s;agreeable interval of bar|ren application &s;hort (which is an hone&s;t author's duty), will carry him at once to the time, when, after many difficulties, my hou&s;es were mo&s;tly occupied, and my pro&s;pect of plea|&s;ure brought, apparently, to a cri&s;is.</P>
<P>You are now, therefore, to &s;up|po&s;e, that a &s;ufficient number of per|&s;ons, well cho&s;en and cautiou&s;ly re|commended, are a&s;&s;embled upon the <HI>Green;</HI> part of whom enjoy the ir|revocable life-pen&s;ion, and part are

Many families, who were pining in want, are in the bo&s;om of indulgence. THE GREEN is in full flower. There are walks for plea&s;ure, bowers of ea&s;e, and a church for devotion.</P>
<P>Though this chapter is very &s;hort, I &s;hall end it directly; on purpo&s;e to give you lei&s;ure to wi&s;h me joy of a great piece of work well ter|minated.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXII. THE STEWARD SHEWS HIMSELF TO BE A MAN OF SENSE.</HEAD>
<P>IF you have not &s;ufficiently revelled in the airy luxury which you, doubtle&s;s, &s;uppo&s;e me to partake, it would be almo&s;t a pity to di&s;turb you with the truth. Yet, as it is the de&s;ign of this narrative, not only to divert, but to <HI>warn,</HI> I mu&s;t de|&s;cend from vi&s;ionary plea&s;ure to mere matter of fact.</P>
<P>At this place, therefore, properly begins The Narrative of the good <HI>People</HI> of <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green</HI>&mdash;A Hi&s;tory of Human Nature; or, The New Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="183">The &s;atisfaction with which I &s;aw &s;o many happy human faces about me (for happine&s;s really re&s;ided with us almo&s;t a whole month), is inde|&s;cribable. Many of the pen&s;ioners I had long known, others were &s;uch as came &s;anctified by the warme&s;t encomiums from &s;uch as I could thoroughly credit; for, luckily, ALL my friends did not corre&s;pond with the characters in Mr. Samuel's catalogue. The trading part of our &s;ociety &s;ettled apart from the circus in a comfortable way, but with due regard to &s;ubordination. The regulations of <HI>The Green</HI> were few; and tho&s;e extremely delicate. All the parade of ringing the com|munity to dinner, or to prayers, was incon&s;i&s;tent with my idea of <HI>indepen|dence.</HI>
<PB N="174" REF="184">I had e&s;tabli&s;hed a common|wealth, in which every man was to plea&s;e and enjoy him&s;elf <HI>in his own way;</HI> nor was there any other re|&s;triction, except that the trade&s;men were not to mix in the walks or amu&s;ements of the pen&s;ioners within the circus, unle&s;s particularly invited. For my own part, I con&s;idered my&s;elf very impartially as the frank friend and familiar companion of every indi|vidual, and, le&s;t any &s;ort of jealou&s;y &s;hould ari&s;e, I endeavoured, as much as might be, to di&s;tribute my atten|tion in equal proportions. The greate&s;t anxiety which I experienced, aro&s;e from a certain fear of &s;eeming, in the eyes of &s;ome, to be a man who enjoyed his pre-eminence. To avoid which, I ca&s;t off the dignity of the
<PB N="175" REF="185">per&s;on of fortune even more than u&s;ual, and brought my&s;elf upon a level with the lowe&s;t.</P>
<P>To &s;uch a community, who would not give at lea&s;t a twelvemonth's una|nimity? Had you &s;een, reader, the joy with which every pen&s;ioner &s;poke of his &s;ituation, while the charm of novelty gilded it; with how ani|mated an eye every man &s;urveyed his little portion of property, and with how enraptured a &s;tep he walked along his own garden, you would have imagined there was little rea&s;on to expect an alteration.</P>
<P>I was <HI>my&s;elf</HI> &s;o entrapped by ap|pearances, and &s;o much in the heaven I had expected, that, meeting the &s;teward one evening after I had been
<PB N="176" REF="186">walking, like a common parent, from door to door, as was my cu&s;tom, well Samuel, &s;aid I, what do you think of my project <HI>now?</HI> Confe&s;s man, that your apprehen&s;ions were ill|founded; confe&s;s, that <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green</HI> is the happie&s;t &s;pot in the whole world.</P>
<P>Many men have many minds, &s;ir, &s;aid Samuel; it would be <HI>atrocious</HI> in me to break in upon a gentle|man's plea&s;ure, though he is, as it were, tru&s;ting his hopes to &s;ea in an egg&s;hell. Far be it from me to brew the tempe&s;t; but, as your Honour hath impo&s;ed on me this &s;teward&s;hip, in which if I increa&s;e my profits, I increa&s;e al&s;o my pains, I think it my duty to &s;peak my
<PB N="177" REF="187">mind; and this I can do with the more a&s;&s;urance, as I have ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed any kind of family-advan|tage, from a &s;cheme which I never did, nor ever <HI>&s;hall,</HI> reli&s;h. Not that I am without per&s;ons, &s;ir, in my fa|mily to whom two hundred pounds a-year would not be a comfortable &s;inecure; but I am an indu&s;trious man my&s;elf, and do not like to cheri&s;h idlene&s;s in any of my race. Add to which, your Honour &s;hall never have it to &s;ay that Samuel Sarca&s;m put it out of his power to &s;peak his hone&s;t &s;entiment (on this <HI>atrocious occa&s;ion</HI>) by taking a &s;ort of bribe. Every one knows the effect of hu&s;h money. I &s;corn it. That being the ca&s;e, I wi&s;h your Honour would hear me.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="188">And what would&s;t thou &s;ay, Mr. Samuel Cicero, the conceited, &s;aid I?</P>
<P>I would &s;ay, &s;ir, replied Samuel, that your &s;cheme is not better put together than was that of your re|nowned rival Don Quixote de la Mancha. Why, &s;ir, do you imagine any human &s;ociety can long pre&s;erve its harmony without regulations? Here have you brought together into one little &s;pot of ground more than half an hundred people, all, or mo&s;tly all, &s;trangers to each other. Do you forget that with that half an hundred of people you have crowded al&s;o into the &s;ame &s;pace at lea&s;t half a thou|&s;and contrary <HI>pa&s;&s;ions?</HI> You will &s;ay, in reply, that mo&s;t of the&s;e pen&s;ioners are exalted from adver&s;ity to pro&s;pe|rity;
<PB N="179" REF="189">I an&s;wer, &s;o much the wor&s;e: the tran&s;ition is too rapid. That misfortune which is taken away <HI>all at once</HI> creates a levity that is omi|nous; but, if it is removed by <HI>degrees,</HI> the head and heart may po&s;&s;ibly bear it decently. It is confe&s;&s;ed, &s;ome of the&s;e per&s;ons have been ruined by their ill &s;tars, others by their ill, or at lea&s;t their imprudent conduct. I might even admit that not one of them is <HI>vicious;</HI> but I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t al&s;o, that every <HI>one</HI> is an human being, and, con&s;equently, addicted to old habits, and not brought without dif|ficulty to the adoption of new; nay, I my&s;elf &s;ir, do not, nor cannot, feel my&s;elf at home in this &s;ame &s;teward's lodge that you have built up for me. It is, to be &s;ure, larger, finer, gayer,
<PB N="180" REF="190">grander; but it has not, as I may &s;ay, the ea&s;e of the <HI>old &s;lipper</HI> about it. It wants a thou&s;and little things that, in fact, may be of no figure, but in the e&s;timation of fancy, who is the godde&s;s of us all, more or le&s;s, they are of immea&s;urable magnitude. Perhaps, &s;ir, you will laugh, when I tell you that, in my new lodge I mi&s;s the three wooden pegs&mdash;on which I was, for &s;o many years, accu&s;tomed to hang my hat, my great coat, and my cane-&s;tring. It is true there are a dozen fine &s;howy bra&s;s hooks, of which one might make the &s;ame u&s;e; but, if I tell you that, in my notion, they do not fit my <HI>purpo&s;e</HI> &s;o well, or rather that they do not fit my fancy, you mu&s;t blame human nature and not me, who am only a poor imper|fect
<PB N="181" REF="191">atom from the du&s;t of the earth. Be a&s;&s;ured, &s;ir, nothing in the world, but my loving your Honour's quiet better than my own, could make me &s;pend the twilight of my day, when all &s;hould go on &s;till and &s;oftly, among&s;t a &s;et of idle creatures col|lected into one little circle, where it is as impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t in tranquillity as it is for yon &s;teeple to &s;tand without a foundation. I beg your pardon, dear and honoured &s;ir, I beg your pardon, but you will find it as I &s;ay. I know the &s;pecies&mdash; I know the &s;pecies.</P>
<P>Oh! no, my good fellow, replyed I, much &s;oftened by his conver&s;ation, that may be the ca&s;e with &s;ocieties in general, but <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green</HI> is &s;o picked, &s;o guarded on the one hand with
<PB N="182" REF="192">by gratitude, and on the other by convenience, that, depend on it, you will find your&s;elf agreeably mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h it heartily, an&s;wered the &s;teward, for to keep your generous temper in the &s;ame golden dream, I could almo&s;t wi&s;h, for once, the or|der of nature inverted. But, I &s;ir, am an old fellow that have looked quietly into the heart of man for many years; and I fear you have built up a village full of arguments again&s;t the po&s;&s;ibi|lity of your happine&s;s.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII. CONTAINING THREE GREAT SURPRIZES; ONE FOR THE READER, AND TWO FOR CERTAIN CHARACTERS.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a particular kind of conver&s;ation which &s;eizes upon all the faculties of the hearer, and leaves him in an anxious &s;tate betwixt doubt and conviction. Such was the emotion at this time wrought in my mind by the &s;entiments of the &s;teward whom I never con&s;idered before as any thing beyond a &s;hrewd &s;arca&s;tic being; but in this la&s;t di&s;cour&s;e, which, by the bye, he delivered in a tone unu&s;ually per&s;ua&s;ive, there ap|peared to be a &s;agacity and know|ledge of men, manners, and na|ture,
<PB N="184" REF="194">that &s;truck me. I confe&s;s I was even &s;tartled. The po&s;&s;ibility of having &s;o long laboured in vain&mdash; the bare po&s;&s;ibility of a di&s;appoint|ment in a hope &s;o tender and &s;o in|dulged, threw me into a very deep pain of thought. It was the hour of night too, in which meditation is heightened, The moon &s;hone, and I indulged my re&s;veree.</P>
<P>Under &s;uch influence I rambled into the wood that lay at the back of the buildings, and there I &s;at down upon a bench which was &s;haded by the thicke&s;t foliage of &s;everal beeches, while it at the &s;ame time commanded two or three of the different paths.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently along the mo&s;t &s;eque&s;|tered of the&s;e appeared the figure of a
<PB N="185" REF="195">female, who &s;ighed &s;orely and re|peatedly, as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed. She paced backwards and forwards for &s;ome time, and at la&s;t &s;tood fixed with her eyes up-lifted to the moon, whom &s;he addre&s;&s;ed in the following manner: Oh! divine and &s;ilver Queen of the Night! If <HI>he</HI> &s;till lives whom I adore, may his bo&s;om be calm and unruffled as thy ray at this moment. May his heart never &s;hare the ago|nies which he has heaped upon Eliza. If, Cynthia, thou art indeed the guardian of the Cha&s;te, exert thy utmo&s;t influence, that he may not ultimately be lo&s;t to Eliza!</P>
<P>I was ju&s;t going to ri&s;e and ad|vance, when the ru&s;tle of the leaves
<PB N="186" REF="196">behind me, and after that, the &s;ur|prize of a plaintive voice repeating the&s;e ver&s;es, deterred me:
<Q><L>In the&s;e deep &s;olitudes and aweful cells,</L>
<L>Where heavenly pen&s;ive Contemplation dwells,</L>
<L>And ever mu&s;ing Melancholy reigns,</L>
<L>What means this tumult &s;till in SIDNEY'S veins?</L></Q></P>
<P>When the voice cea&s;ed, I perceived a man with his arms folded, &s;liding, as it were, round a groupe of &s;emi|circular bu&s;hes which led him into the front path where I had, a little before, &s;een the lady. Here, in le&s;s than a minute, the two met, exactly in the in&s;tant that each was pro|nouncing the name of the other.</P>
<P>My great God!&mdash;exclaimed the lady.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="197">Oh! righteous heaven!&mdash;cried the gentleman.</P>
<P>No, &s;ir; (&s;aid the lady, di&s;engage|ing her&s;elf on a &s;udden from the embraces of the &s;tranger) I am &s;till Eliza. I a&s;k not by what means you found me in this a&s;ylum&mdash;I am wronged.</P>
<P>I &s;ought it to &s;oothe my &s;orrows in a new and unknown part of the world. It is on this principle that I am Sir Benjamin's pen&s;ioner. I arrived two days ago.</P>
<P>And you will depart to-morrow. It is impo&s;&s;ible for both of us to ta&s;te the benevolence of the patron of this place. My injuries are &s;till in my heart.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="198">And is no part of Sidney there, Eliza?</P>
<P>Ought any part of Sidney to be there?&mdash;an&s;wered Eliza, in the mo&s;t penetrating tone.</P>
<P>Ah! madam, it was my accur&s;ed delicacy, and the pride of my youth &mdash;it was not my heart that ever in|jured my Eliza. I have been by the world, and its follies, reduced to the want even of bread &s;ince we la&s;t parted; and had it not been for the benevolence of Sir Benjamin Beau|champ, who takes me merely on the credit of &s;ome unknown friend, I had been utterly lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Too proud to own Eliza, &s;ir, I &s;ind, even when you wanted bread.
<PB N="189" REF="199">But I have &s;erved you, Mr. Sidney, in de&s;pite of your&s;elf.</P>
<P>You?&mdash;<HI>you</HI>&mdash;Eliza?</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> was the unknown friend, who took care that, if you were living, you &s;hould be an inhabitant of <HI>Shen|&s;tone-Green.</HI></P>
<P>Obligations, madam, heaped on the head without hope of repay|ment&mdash;I &s;ay, Eliza, there are minds &mdash;minds of a certain frame, which&mdash;.</P>
<P>Fre&s;h injuries, Mr. Sidney!</P>
<P>No, madam; the balance is even &mdash;nay, I know not but the &s;cale may turn in <HI>my</HI> favour. You was at a ma&s;querade in &s;ome danger&mdash; Recollect.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="200">My very life and honour was pre|&s;erved by a generous domino.</P>
<P>It <HI>was</HI> &s;o, Eliza; and <HI>I</HI> triumphed in di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>Save me from ruin; yet refu&s;e to &s;peak, or to di&s;cover your&s;elf, &s;ir.</P>
<P>For <HI>that</HI> very rea&s;on, I cannot bear to be out done by Eliza.</P>
<P>Nor I by Mr. Sidney. I will be revenged yet&mdash;nay, I <HI>have</HI> been &s;o. You are in my debt after all.</P>
<P>Impo&s;&s;ible, madam.</P>
<P>Remember your &s;ituation at Mr. Jo&s;hua's.</P>
<P>Ha!&mdash;Go on.</P>
<P>The &s;cratch of the &s;word is &s;till in <HI>my</HI> arm, &s;ir.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="201">Confu&s;ion, madam; you re&s;cue my body to &s;tab my &s;ould&mdash;my &s;en|&s;ibility is bleeding at every pore. I had rather die than not be on an <HI>equality</HI> with Eliza. Her &s;uperiority kills me&mdash;but one way is yet left.</P>
<P>Name it.</P>
<P>My joy at finding you here is &s;o big and &s;o unexpected, that I &s;hall certainly &s;oar above even the ambi|tious flights of Eliza; for I will bear to be <HI>her inferior,</HI> and, for the fir&s;t time in my life, yield up the delicacy of being on a <HI>level</HI> with the woman I adore.</P>
<P>Then you <HI>have</HI> conquered.&mdash;Ah! Sidney, why &s;o long in yielding?&mdash; What mi&s;eries might have been prevented!</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="202">Ble&s;&s;ed be Sir Benjamin Beau|champ, Eliza!&mdash;We are &s;afe in his paradi&s;e&mdash;he is the guardian of our &s;anctuary. (My heart fluttered, reader.)</P>
<P>He is more a God within the la&s;t hour than ever, for I now know he is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mr. <HI>Sidney.</HI></P>
<P>Take care, Eliza, your very ten|derne&s;&s;es mu&s;t not <HI>&s;urpa&s;s mine.</HI> Your love, madam, is not &s;uperior.</P>
<P>Is not a ki&s;s u&s;ually the &s;eal of a lover's forgivene&s;s, Sidney?&mdash;I &s;up|po&s;e you know that our delicacy de|mands, as u&s;ual, inviolable &s;ecrecy. No body is &s;o much as to <HI>&s;u&s;pect our pa&s;&s;ion.</HI> Love is hurt by being known to a third per&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="203">Have I ever, madam, been void of that &s;acred and e&s;&s;ential delicacy?</P>
<P>But a <HI>hint,</HI> you know&mdash;</P>
<P>Is an in&s;ult, madam.&mdash;I am as nice as your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Not <HI>more</HI> &s;o, &s;ir.</P>
<P>No&mdash;<HI>perhaps,</HI> not more &s;o.</P>
<P><HI>Perhaps</HI>&mdash;!</P>
<P>I tell you again, Eliza, I will bear, to-night that you &s;hall hold the <HI>fir&s;t place</HI> in the dignity of pa&s;&s;ion. Tri|umph, triumph, Eliza.</P>
<P>On that &s;core, then, we are&mdash; friends.</P>
<P><HI>Friends,</HI> madam?&mdash;no, we are not friends.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="204">Lovers&mdash;lovers&mdash;if you will&mdash; Lord, why don't you take my hand then and ki&s;s it as you u&s;ed to do?</P>
<P>Here the&s;e over-delicate lovers, who had thus met by accident, went out of the wood in the greate&s;t harmony, after all tho&s;e little &s;pars which di&s;cover affection. I left my bench, and followed them &s;o as not to be &s;een, had they even looked back. Curious to know the full extent of this uncommon deli|cacy of &s;entiment, I pur&s;ued them even to the door of the lady's hou&s;e, at which they exchanged kind ex|pre&s;&s;ions, and very mode&s;tly &s;eparated. The gentleman tripped acro&s;s the <HI>Green</HI> to his own apartments.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="205">The exultation I felt at the fini&s;h|ing of this tran&s;action was by no means incon&s;iderable. All the <HI>&s;ombre</HI> ideas which the &s;teward had &s;pread about me were vani&s;hed. No, no, Samuel, &s;aid I, there is no truth, after all, in thy &s;eemingly &s;olid &s;en|timents. If my adventures continue to go on as they have begun, <HI>Shen|&s;tone-Green</HI> &s;hall boa&s;t its empire over the heart as well as the imagination. A lover is already re&s;tored to his mi&s;|tre&s;s, and though both may be a little too punctilious, &s;aid I, both are ami|able.</P>
<P>I now walked home to bed, ki&s;&s;ed my darling Matilda, (as it was always my rule before I went to re&s;t) and then dreamed of Sidney and Eliza. Happy re&s;t to Thee, reader.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV. BEGINS WITH THE PROPRIETOR'S BE|NEVOLENCE, AND ENDS WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF A WHISTLER.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning's &s;un ro&s;e golden upon <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green,</HI> and I went early forth into the ad|jacent fields to ta&s;te the lovelie&s;t hours of the four and twenty. As I pa&s;&s;ed the circus, (than which no|thing in Eden could well have been more beautiful) I felt a kind of &s;en|&s;ation which &s;eemed to &s;ay, the&s;e fair environs are, Benjamin, of thy own creation; it was thou who cau&s;ed the ro&s;e-tree to be thus &s;aluted by the da&s;hing dew-drop. Yon lillies, pinks, and eglantine, which send
<PB N="197" REF="207">their odours on the zephyr, were of thy planting. And, ah! more vo|luptuous and more dear to thought, thou it was who adorned the&s;e little repo&s;itories with the happy &s;ouls which now inhabit them, and cau&s;ed every dwelling to be &s;urrounded with &s;weets. The very &s;un &s;eems to dart on thee, as thou thus &s;tandeth in the centre of thy works, his ri&s;ing ray of approbation. Every pen&s;ioner is now in the balmy arms of &s;leep. Lovers, who were before divided, are dream|ing of to-morrow's interview. The lately-&s;eparated hu&s;band and wife are brought again, by thy means, into the bed of reconciliation. The inva|lids of the place are repo&s;ing them|&s;elves. Tho&s;e who had fallen from the heights of fortune into the vales
<PB N="198" REF="208">of di&s;tre&s;s, have here a cradle in which they are lulled into peace. In a word, thy whole family is at this moment in ely&s;ium.</P>
<P>Ah! SHENSTONE, wert thou but here to complete the felicity which was by thee &s;ugge&s;ted, how perfect would it be! This fond idea led to a con&s;ideration of that amiable man's moral character, and I could not help exclaiming, in the words of a poet who at once imitated and lamented him:
<Q><LG>
<L>They call'd him the pride of the plain&mdash;</L>
<L>In &s;ooth he was gentle and kind;</L>
<L>He mark'd in his elegant &s;train</L>
<L>The graces that glow'd in his mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On purpo&s;e he planted the trees,</L>
<L>That birds in the covert might dwell;</L>
<L>He cultur'd the thyme for the bees,</L>
<L>But never would rifle the cell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="199" REF="209">
<L>Ye lambkins that play'd at his feet,</L>
<L>Go bleat, and your ma&s;ter bemoan;</L>
<L>His mu&s;ic was artle&s;s and &s;weet;</L>
<L>His manners, as mild as your own.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>I had by this time got into the fields, where I perceived walking with large full &s;trides over the ridges of the land, a man who &s;eemed to be cro&s;&s;ing the country on &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s of the utmo&s;t di&s;patch. He was tall and well made, but in that &s;ort of dre&s;s in which appeared the marks of a gentleman reduced. He had an handkerchief in his hand, with which, from time to time, he wiped his fore|head. His &s;hoes had all the look of having laboured through a long jour|ney, and the du&s;t of the road had deeply embrowned his once-white &s;tockings. Yet, notwith&s;tanding all
<PB N="200" REF="210">the&s;e marks of a vagabond, there &s;hone through his &s;habbine&s;s a certain air of fa&s;hion and dignity, which de|noted him to have known better days. Upon &s;eeing me walking along the green &s;ide of the hedge, he &s;till quickened his pace till he came up to me, whi&s;tling all the way extremely loud.</P>
<P>We exchanged bows.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid the &s;tranger, in a noble and full pronunciation, can you direct me the neare&s;t way to the man&s;ion of Sir Benjamin Beauchamp?</P>
<P>Have you any particular com|mands with that gentleman?</P>
<P>No commands, &s;ir; but many entreaties. I come with recommen|dations to him from particular friends.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="211">Who may tho&s;e friends be, &s;ir?</P>
<P>They are, as I under&s;tand, the only ones who could procure a man the honour of Sir Benjamin's pro|tection.</P>
<P>Have the goodne&s;s to name them.</P>
<P>Poverty and a feeling heart.</P>
<P>Powerful advocates it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed, &s;ir.</P>
<P>Yes, they are &s;o; and it is under &s;uch &s;plendid patronage, that I have the confidence to offer my&s;elf as a candidate for <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green.</HI> There, &s;ir, is a voucher for my truth.</P>
<P>Here he took from his pocket a letter, and again reque&s;ted I would direct him on his way.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="212">I believe, &s;ir, &s;aid I, looking at the &s;uper&s;cription, you may &s;uffer me to break the &s;eal of that letter.</P>
<P>Whew, cried the &s;tranger, how could I be &s;o long mi&s;taken? Where is fled, all at once, my knowledge in the hi&s;tory of human faces? How has it been po&s;&s;ible for me to over|look lineaments &s;o palpable? That open brow, and that expanded eye &mdash;to whom could they belong, but to Sir Benjamin Beauchamp!

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR OLD FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU &s;till a&s;k me to collect can|didates for <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green,</HI> which you have built on a very new plan
<PB N="203" REF="213">indeed. This &s;crawl will be put into your hand, by a per&s;on whom I have known as many years as I have known your. In all that time, his immen&s;e riches appeared his lea&s;t attraction. We have monuments of him in &s;everal parts of this city, which will carry his character, with that of Sir Ben|jamin Beauchamp, to po&s;terity. To my utter a&s;toni&s;hment, he now complains of a &s;udden turn which makes him &s;eek a &s;anctuary with your <HI>Shen&s;tonians.</HI> I have my&s;elf offered him money to any amount. He rejects all examination into his affairs; and &s;ays, the only favour I can po&s;&s;ibly do him, is to &s;ay a decent thing for his di&s;tre&s;s to my old friend Sir Benjamin.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="214">With regard to <HI>decent things,</HI> as he calls them, were I to &s;ay all which I know of Mr. Seabrooke, the bearer, I mu&s;t write a volume, and not a letter.</P>

<DATELINE><HI>London.</HI></DATELINE></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Mr. Seabrooke, &s;aid I, as &s;oon as I had fini&s;hed this letter, the only matters which di&s;tre&s;s me on this occa&s;ion, are, fir&s;t, the incon&s;iderable &s;ize of the <HI>Shen&s;tone</HI> premium, when it is compared to the property which you have been accu&s;tomed to com|mand; and &s;econdly, that you &s;hould have been under the nece&s;&s;ity of com|ing
<PB N="205" REF="215">to your little pittance on foot. Had I known, &s;ir&mdash;.</P>
<P>Whew&mdash;Sir Benjamin, &s;aid Mr. Seabrooke interpo&s;ing, do not you be afflicted at the very things which form a material part of my happi|ne&s;s. There is great variety, in a man of my temper, in thus &s;tepping from an unweildy fortune, to &s;uch a one as I can very well manage. It cuts off &s;uperfluous anxiety. It is like entering a neat cottage (where one detects an impropriety in a mo|ment), after coming &s;uddenly out of great apartments, who&s;e length and va&s;titude prevent the po&s;&s;ibility of being <HI>accurate.</HI> With re&s;pect to <HI>walking,</HI> it is the favourite exerci&s;e of my life; I &s;ometimes divert my|&s;elf
<PB N="206" REF="216">with objects on the road, which, my being <HI>on a level</HI> with them, offers to ob&s;ervation; and yet, which, had I been perked up beyond my natural height on the back of a hor&s;e, would have been all overlooked. In a gay may-lady, or in gilded bug; in the twi&s;t of a branch, or in the colours of a flower; I &s;ee a &s;atisfaction, which, though I very &s;en&s;ibly feel when I am in the proper humour, I &s;hall not attempt to de&s;cribe. If, therefore, you have the goodne&s;s to give me my own way, you will be&s;tow one of the &s;malle&s;t hou&s;es of your new town, and &s;lit the yearly pen&s;ion between two.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this conver&s;ation, I had turned about towards <HI>The
<PB N="207" REF="217">Green,</HI> and we were on the way home to the man&s;ion-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>And this, I pre&s;ume, is your <HI>New Paradi&s;e</HI> (&s;aid the gentleman, as we came within view of <HI>Shen&s;tone-Green</HI>). Here, you amu&s;e your&s;elf in a way wherein you will find few to applaud, and <HI>none</HI> to imitate you. For my part, the chief &s;atisfaction I &s;hall find under your protection, is to live in this fair world, and join the chorus of happy creatures in their orai&s;ons and ve&s;pers of, gratitude. Whew&mdash; what a divine Sir Benjamin you are!</P>
<P>I led Mr. Seabrooke from hence to the man&s;ion-hou&s;e, where he, I, and Matilda, &s;at comfortably down to breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="218">Young lady, &s;aid he to my daughter, you &s;ee a very proud beggar before you. I am come to &s;educe your worthy father, by a whining tale, out of two hundred a-year and a good hou&s;e. As you are his only daughter, and con&s;e|quently his heir, pray how do you reli&s;h this &s;cheme?</P>
<P>My father, replied Matilda, is in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my &s;entiments on that head; and will, therefore, more gracefully inform you of them, than it is in my power. Yet, I cannot but add, that as I am convinced Sir Benjamin is ever delicate in &s;electing his objects, I feel additional &s;atisfaction at &s;eeing two hundred pounds a-year <HI>more,</HI> likely to be laid out to the be&s;t advantage.&mdash;She curte&s;yed.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="219">Oh brave! dam&s;el, rejoined Mr. Seabrooke, but do you rightly con|&s;ider how many much finer things might be done with that &s;um of money, Mi&s;s Matilda?&mdash;but your very name is an encouragement to poetical projects.</P>
<P>No, really, &s;ir; pray in&s;truct me how that is po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid Matilda (putting the &s;ugar into Mr. Sea|brooke's cup.)</P>
<P>Why, two hundred pounds <HI>per an|num,</HI> an&s;wered Mr. Seabrooke, would enable you (&s;uppo&s;ing it to be re|&s;erved wholly for fa&s;hionable luxu|ries) to do a great many genteel and imprudent things, of which you have now, perhaps, no conception. If it were laid out to advantage, you
<PB N="210" REF="220">might, therewith, do a great deal of mi&s;chief. It would even go a con&s;i|derable way at the, card-table, and give you the head-ach, or the heart-ach, for a week together. For ought I know, you might contrive to ruin your complexion (clear as it is) for ever, with the &s;um which you are here going to expend upon a poor fellow with a pair of ru&s;ty &s;hoes, and a coat of camblet. Really, young lady, it is a &s;erious affair, and I would have you think well of it before-hand&mdash;I would, indeed.</P>
<P>And now you talk of that, Sir Benjamin (continued Mr. Seabrooke, after a &s;hort pau&s;e) I cannot but think <HI>you</HI> are engaged here in a very &s;ingular piece of bu&s;ine&s;s. Why,
<PB N="211" REF="221">my good &s;ir, do you maturely reflect into what innumerable channels this ocean of money you have exhau&s;ted on brick, mortar, and men, who are no way allied to you&mdash;do you, I &s;ay, con&s;ider, how &s;uch riches might have, as it were, deluged every di&s;hone&s;t &s;en&s;e about you, in that plea&s;ure which is &s;o much the general pur|&s;uit? In&s;tead of you ample range of hou&s;es, which rob Sorrow of her de&s;tined prey, and the real &s;coundrels of the earth of their ridicule, might you not have built up &s;tabling for the fine&s;t &s;teeds that ever were &s;een; and might you not have had the &s;a|tisfaction of inviting the world to &s;ee your fine hor&s;es, in&s;tead of your poor men and women? In&s;tead of erecting a <HI>Church,</HI> could you not, at
<PB N="212" REF="222">le&s;s expence, have built a <HI>Seraglio,</HI> and peopled it with de&s;titute beauty, and defrauded innocence, in the man|ner of many per&s;ons of fortune? In&s;tead of giving away &s;uch loads of wealth, might you not have put in for the chance of doubling it at the hazard table; and even if you &s;hould perceive the die go again&s;t you, is it not a &s;ort of exit made popular by the practice of modern men of &s;pirit, to retire from the gaming-table in elegant di&s;order, and very philo&s;ophically &s;hoot your&s;elf through the head? In&s;tead of pro|viding for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of &s;uch a pack of poor wretches, as, in the wi&s;e opinion of the world, have no <HI>right</HI> to the appetites or pa&s;&s;ions of nature, could you not with the &s;olid
<PB N="213" REF="223">ca&s;h, or as the mi&s;er calls it more emphatically, with <Q>the good hard money</Q> &s;o expended, have made a river of claret, and &s;wam in all the voluptuou&s;ne&s;s of the mo&s;t expen|&s;ive drunkenne&s;s? In fine, might you not have been the mo&s;t gainful u&s;urer, or any other celebrated cha|racter much coveted among&s;t men, had you acted in a prudential way? In&s;tead of which, you have nothing to &s;how for forty or fifty thou&s;and pounds, but a large hand&s;ome vil|lage, which does not bring you in one &s;hilling of "good hard money," a few tears and &s;miles from poor &s;ouls who have nothing el&s;e to give you; a private plea&s;ure which plea&s;es your con&s;cience, without filling your pur&s;e; and the expectation of a &s;ome|thing
<PB N="214" REF="224">yonder (here he pointed to heaven) which is of &s;o little weight in the e&s;timation of other people, that they would not lend a &s;ingle guinea upon &s;uch &s;ecurity. No, Sir Ben|jamin, you may go on as you plea&s;e, but if you cannot an&s;wer this con|duct to your&s;elf, I do not know who you will find among&s;t your friends that will &s;tep forth in your behalf. They will be afraid, &s;ir, to &s;ay any thing in excu&s;e, le&s;t the &s;ame &s;ingu|larity &s;hould be expected on their part.</P>
<P>The fine ironical tone which at|tended this &s;peech, led us immedi|ately into the oblique compliment it conveyed; and Mr. Seabrooke had, herein, &s;o developed his own cha|racter,
<PB N="215" REF="225">that all further de&s;cription of him is unnece&s;&s;ary. I take it for granted, the reader hath a very fa|vourable idea of him, and would wi&s;h a more intimate acquaintance. It is mo&s;t likely he will not be di&s;|appointed.</P>
<P>Suffice it to &s;ay, at pre&s;ent, that, after a great deal of per&s;ua&s;ion, both from Matilda and me, he agreed to live in the man&s;ion-hou&s;e in a family|way, but &s;till in&s;i&s;ted that I &s;hould &s;ave nothing; for, though I might &s;top &s;omething for <HI>board,</HI> he &s;aid, he was re&s;olved to have the re&s;t of his pen&s;ion like another pen&s;ioner.</P>
<P>As look and manner is not very accurately put into written language, I cannot well tell you how this la&s;t
<PB N="216" REF="226">ob&s;ervation occa&s;ioned a &s;incere &s;mile. I ju&s;t remark, that Mr. Seabrooke is a man with whom it is impo&s;&s;ible to be offended.</P>
