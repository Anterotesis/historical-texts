<HEAD>TO MRS. COCKBURNE, OF MADRAS.</HEAD>
<P>IT was the opinion of Mrs. COCK|BURNE, that much of the literary matter which the author had &s;ome thoughts of offering to the public, &s;eparately, in an in|troductory volume, with a delineation of &s;ome of the characters, and a de&s;ign of the work, might be wrought, with better effect, into the work it&s;elf. He leaves the public to judge how far he is authori&s;ed in adopting that opinion. The accurate and able manner in which this lady, at a very early period of life, transfu&s;ed into the Engli&s;h language, as well the <HI>profound</HI> and <HI>ab&s;tract,</HI> as gay and elegant, "THOUGHTS" of the celebrated
<PB N="iv" REF="3">citizen of Geneva <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thoughts of Jean-Jacques Rou&s;&s;eau, tran&s;lated by Mi&s;s Henrietta Colebrooke.</NOTE>,&mdash;where he "re-echoes, in the character of the <HI>Genius</HI> and <HI>Repre&s;enta|tive</HI> of human nature, and communicates to his readers that enthu&s;ia&s;tic love of nature and virtue which glowed in his own brea&s;t," at the &s;ame time that &s;he has avoided in|termixing the eccentricities and errors of what is excellent and u&s;eful in the writings of that exalted genius,&mdash;&s;ufficiently evinces the &s;terling value of her ob&s;ervations. The author, therefore, has again ventured to in|corporate <HI>part</HI> of what he had, indeed, twice before embodied and withdrawn, from a &s;incere doubt of his own powers to inter|weave it with <HI>advantage</HI> to the general in+tere&s;ts of the book; for therein only can there be hazard. Of the POSSIBILITY of <HI>rai&s;ing</HI> the general character of the Engli&s;h romance, by the inter&s;per&s;ion of &s;ubjects of weight and &s;ublimity, either in &s;cience or morals, &s;o as likewi&s;e to rai&s;e the pa&s;&s;ions and affections of the fable, there cannot be a doubt: and it has, indeed, been by &s;e|veral
<PB N="v" REF="4">authors occa&s;ionally attempted, and with &s;ucce&s;s to a degree, but with apparent apprehen&s;ion. The author of the&s;e pages is, therefore, perfectly &s;atisfied that the IDEA with which Mrs. COCKBURNE has honoured him, will receive the unequivocal &s;uffrage of the profe&s;&s;ional critics, to whom his attempt to reali&s;e it is &s;ubmitted: and could he have a moment's apprehen&s;ion of that IDEA meet|ing di&s;approbation, he would certainly not have &s;ubjected her to any part of the cen|&s;ure he may incur from his own failure in the management of it.</P>
<P>But the obligation which the author owes to Mrs. COCKBURNE on the &s;core of literary arrangement is not the &s;ole motive for ad|dre&s;&s;ing to her a proportion of this work, and <HI>that</HI> without any previous &s;olicitation. The &s;electing of a patron is, he conceives, among&s;t the <HI>inherent</HI> RIGHTS of literature, which, however, he is aware her delicacy would, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, have di&s;|puted or denied: but there are privileges of an independent nature, the a&s;&s;ertion of which &s;hould re&s;t on our own judgment and
<PB N="vi" REF="5">di&s;cretion; and any <HI>petition</HI> to exerci&s;e the&s;e, implies a doubt even that they exi&s;t. The <HI>freedom of election,</HI> as to the choice of a vir|tuous per&s;on to exemplify a virtuous, even though it may be an un&s;ucce&s;sful endeavour, ought to be looked upon as among&s;t the mo&s;t inalienable rights attached to th&egrave; charter of literature. On that authority a writer &s;hould feel that he has
<Q>The world before him where to choo&s;e:</Q>
and, on that authority, the author of the&s;e &s;heets takes leave to illu&s;trate, by the con|duct of Mrs. COCKBURNE, his attempted portrait of a female, which may &s;erve as an example of the filial, fraternal, and conju|gal, virtues: and to &s;anction this illu&s;tration, he refers to that lady's family and friends, nay, to a yet &s;tronger te&s;timony,&mdash;her own CONSCIOUS HEART!</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>SHORTLY after John's departure, another day of unremitting embarra&s;ment happened to Henry: the provoking cro&s;s purpo&s;es began in the morning, and conti|nued until the evening, and were indeed re|&s;umed the next morning.</P>
<P>A gentleman now arrived at the ca&s;tle, of a very &s;ingular character and conver&s;ation. His youth had been pa&s;t partly at &s;ea, and partly in foreign climes; and being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a very competent fortune, as well from patrimony as from &s;ucce&s;sful adven|ture, he had, for &s;ome years back, quitted the ocean, and all its enterpri&s;es, and &s;et him&s;elf down on &s;hore, in a very comfort|able dwelling, within a neighbourly di&s;tance of Fitzorton Ca&s;tle. Mr. Partington had many peculiarities;&mdash;there was a rough ho|ne&s;ty
<PB N="2" REF="12">in his manner, and a fredom of expre&s;|&s;ion corre&s;ponding to it, which, at fir&s;t &s;ight, &s;eemed more boi&s;terous and rugged than the element on which he had been educated. His per&s;on was &s;omething under the middle &s;ize, and his features had little more of &s;moothne&s;s than his manners: but, beneath this uninviting exterior, beat a heart, every pul&s;ation of which was genuine good-will to mankind, without the lea&s;t alloy of <HI>&s;enti|mentality,</HI>&mdash;that &s;hining dro&s;s which makes &s;o much glitter in the&s;e tin&s;el times. Parting|ton, if he liked you, was a friend <HI>indeed!</HI> but, the more he fancied you, the rougher would you find his addre&s;s; and this rule held good in all the degrees of his appro|bation:&mdash;for, exactly proportioned to his <HI>good opinion</HI> was his jocular rudene&s;s. If he thought tolerably <HI>well</HI> of you, he would call you a &s;ad fellow; if, on farther acquaint|ance, you improved in his good graces, you would advance al&s;o in the &s;cale of abu&s;e, and he would &s;peak of and <HI>to</HI> you as a cur&s;ed good-for-nothing devil: and when he had taken you into his heart,&mdash;wherein, by the
<PB N="3" REF="13">bye, you might confide your honour, your happine&s;s, and your life,&mdash;he would honour you by the appellation of a damned in&s;uffer|able &s;coundrel! This being the highe&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of his e&s;teem, could be boa&s;ted of by few; for Partington never thought any man or woman de&s;erving of <HI>this</HI> mark of his affection, unle&s;s they appeared to him pre-eminently great or good. We &s;ay, "man or woman," becau&s;e the &s;ex of the per&s;on made no manner of difference to him.</P>
<P>His <HI>di&s;like,</HI> on the other hand, was ex|pre&s;&s;ed in quite a <HI>contrary</HI> way; but &s;till he marked it by the &s;ame gradations. If nei|ther your head nor your heart was &s;atisfac|tory to him,&mdash;that is, if the fir&s;t was not worth carrying upon your &s;houlders, nor the other in your bo&s;om,&mdash;he would, if he &s;poke to you at all, acco&s;t you in very civil lan|guage. If you had any thing remarkably ba&s;e in your di&s;po&s;ition, he would be yet more polite, calling you &s;ir, or madam; and if he thought you de&s;erved a box on the ear, or the gallows, in&s;tead of a bow, he would
<PB N="4" REF="14">even <HI>pull off his hat!</HI>&mdash;which being the la&s;t evidence of his <HI>abhorrence,</HI> bore the &s;ame pro|portion of contempt that his <HI>damned in&s;uffer|able &s;coundrel</HI> did of affection. Nor were even his benevolences them&s;elves le&s;s re|markably his own, than his modes of ex|pre&s;&s;ion. He never <HI>talked</HI> of doing any per|&s;on a kindne&s;s, and yet was kindne&s;s it&s;elf. In truth, while other people were <HI>only</HI> talking, he would be doing the very thing they talked about; for he would &s;lip out of company, on fifty different pretences, none of which you could &s;u&s;pect,&mdash;and have had an interview with the party he had heard commi&s;erated,&mdash;then return to the compa|ny with no alteration in his general manner, but that of loading with exaggerated &s;currility the per&s;on to whom he was indebted for the opportunity of being bountiful: for, as this was the highe&s;t obligation his heart was ca|pable of receiving, he had no other way of returning it. But more frequently he would appear altogether inattentive to tales of di|&s;tre&s;s, or, if he <HI>did</HI> give ear to them, would break out into&mdash;"P&s;ha!&mdash;don't tell me!
<PB N="5" REF="15">riff-raff! &s;tuff! a pack of beggars! I &s;hould not have thought of their impudence! I &s;ay di&s;tre&s;s too!" and many &s;uch like exclama|tions: yet he would be at the door, or at the bed-&s;ide of the &s;ufferers, and have every thing that was really of comfort in their ha|bitations, before any other man of the party thought of leaving company. If, for in|&s;tance, an apothecary was wanted, he would arou&s;e him in the middle of the night, drag him out of bed, or &s;ome way or other get him under his arm: and if common nece&s;|&s;aries were to be &s;upplied, he would run to his little <HI>poor-ra&s;cal's warehou&s;e,</HI> as he u&s;ed to call it,&mdash;and, making up his bundle accord|ing to the ca&s;e, carry it in his hand, and have done his work before his orders to an unintere&s;ted dome&s;tic could have been well given.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<P>PARTINGTON had been long in the ha|bits of intimacy with Sir Armine, and ho|noured the family with a liberal &s;hare of his
<PB N="6" REF="16">loving abu&s;e, whenever he made it a vi&s;it; and each individual was as jealous of that abu&s;e as de&s;irous of his company. The trio of brothers filled his &s;cale of epithets! James was only one of his middling &s;ort of fellows; John had the plea&s;ure to be ranked his cur&s;ed good-for-nothing caitiff; and Henry enjoyed the &s;upreme di&s;tinction of being al|mo&s;t the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of his damned in&s;ufferable &s;coundrels. "Hark'ee, you Mr. middling &s;ort of fellow," addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to James after dinner, "how goes on the affair be|tween this damned, in&s;ufferable &s;coundrel,"&mdash;here he &s;hook Henry by the hand&mdash;"and you know who&mdash;you cur&s;ed good-for-no|thing little devil?"&mdash;tapping Olivia on the cheek&mdash;"What &s;ay <HI>you,</HI> you old ra&s;cal?" add|ed he, turning to Sir Armine: "are you get|ting your gouty legs in order, to dance at the wedding? 'Sbud! man, you ought, upon that occa&s;ion, to give us an hornpipe upon your &s;tumps, like Witherington; for two &s;uch pretty caitiffs as the&s;e do not come to|gether every day, I can tell you! But, what are you all about, you lazy vagabonds,&mdash;
<PB N="7" REF="17">&s;hilly &s;hally? If I were a par&s;on, they &s;hould be married before I left the hou&s;e:&mdash;young folks can't begin to be happy too &s;oon.&mdash;Now look how that in&s;ufferable poltroon" (to Henry) "&s;hakes and trembles:&mdash;why, one would think, in&s;tead of feeling the flames of love on &s;itting &s;o clo&s;e to a fine girl, who&s;e tell-tale blu&s;hes ought to make him blaze out like a bonfire, that the ague had got hold of him. By the arm of my body, he quivers like a Lapland witch! Well, come, I will give him my ble&s;&s;ing in a bumper. However, marry when they will, may the pledges of their love be ju&s;t as good-for-nothing as their parents! the girls abominable hu&s;&s;eys, and the boys damned in&s;ufferable &s;coundrels! Put it round, old Vulcan!" &s;aid he, pu&s;hing the bottle to Sir Armine: he then &s;tood up, and &s;ung &s;ome &s;tanzas, &s;o replete with humour in them&s;elves, and in &s;o quaint and ludicrous a manner, that the whole company caught the hilarity of their worthy gue&s;t.</P>
<P>"Was there ever &s;uch a comical crea|ture?" exclaimed Olivia &s;miling.&mdash;"But
<PB N="8" REF="18">hold, what is this I hear about Henry's go|ing to be hanged for his fine devil's-works at the abbey?"</P>
<P>Henry's confu&s;ion was now re-doubled upon another account: for he did not at all doubt but that the &s;ubject which had been remotely alluded to by John, would be ful|ly explained by this unqualifying &s;on of the waves. Henry winked, nodded, and made other &s;igns of keeping &s;ilence, which not only increa&s;ed the curio&s;ity of the company, but made Partington more determined. "I don't care for your wry faces a bra&s;s but|ton, you &s;coundrel," &s;aid he: "I &s;ay, not|with&s;tanding all your antics, you will come to the gallows:&mdash;'tis a &s;erious matter to knock down a baronet on the very &s;pot where he is to be buried, then throw his daughter into fits, and run away from both of them."</P>
<P>"Knock him down?" &s;aid Olivia. "Why, good heavens! if it had not been for Henry, Sir Gui&s;e would have been murdered. And as to Mi&s;s Stuart, for whom my &s;oul &s;till bleeds, her fits were occa&s;ioned (God
<PB N="9" REF="19">knows) by the lo&s;s of her &s;weet mother: for, as her brother could not attend, Henry was her only comforter. This is the whole of the matter, I do a&s;&s;ure you, Mr. Part|ington."</P>
<P>The earne&s;t &s;implicity with which &s;he uttered this, in the defence, and to the ho|nour, of him &s;he loved, and for whom &s;he had always a vindication, had a vi&s;ible effect upon all, but more particularly on Henry, who, torn betwixt the &s;en&s;ations of grati|tude and &s;hame, tenderly care&s;&s;ed her.</P>
<P>"You are both of you a couple of in&s;uf|ferable &s;coundrels, and encourage one an|other. For that matter, I'd lay my life, if this egregious villain"&mdash;to Henry&mdash;"<HI>&s;hould</HI> be hanged, this dimpling caitiff would tie her|&s;elf up in her garters the next morning, that &s;he might lovingly dangle by his &s;ide, upon the &s;ame gibbet. So, as I hope yet to &s;ee them tied up together, I think 'tis the be&s;t way to pinion them now, till their time comes."&mdash;Here he drew them clo&s;e to his own bo&s;om, formed their arms into the wreathe of love, and ordering the whole
<PB N="10" REF="20">party to follow their example, conducted them into the garden.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<P>THUS were matters rein&s;tated, to the general &s;atisfaction; and even Henry felt it might have been much wor&s;e; for, though it had been &s;o long the wi&s;h and endeavour of his heart to come to an explanation of its fatal &s;ecret,&mdash;any di&s;clo&s;ure of it at &s;uch a time, in &s;uch a place, and under &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances, would have been the mo&s;t overwhelming event that could have happen|ed to him.</P>
<P>Partington, who had the romping play|fulne&s;s of a boy, without the lea&s;t of that mi&s;chief which u&s;ually attaches to the &s;port of youth, continued his plea&s;antries, a|mong&s;t which was a propo&s;ition to run up|on the green-&s;ward along the park with Henry,&mdash;the winner to be intitled to a ki&s;s from Olivia, and Olivia her&s;elf to be the umpire.</P>
<P>He pointed to a clump of elms, as the
<PB N="11" REF="21">given di&s;tance: the putting him&s;elf into a &s;tarting po&s;ture, "There&mdash;I'll give you law, you villain&mdash;&s;o away with you!" Henry was, perhaps, never le&s;s in di&s;po&s;ition for a frolic; but knowing that Partington,&mdash;who had now doubled his fi&s;ts,&mdash;would have pu&s;hed him headlong forward, had he &s;uffered him|&s;elf to be overtaken, he &s;oon &s;prung to the goal; in doing which, however, he contriv|ed to trip up Partington's heels, to the no &s;mall diver&s;ion of the company. "A bubble bet!" cried Partington, &s;crambling up: "the race was obtained only by a fraud, el&s;e I &s;hould have beat him hollow:&mdash;a contrived thing! I &s;aw both the villains laying their heads together, concerting how it &s;hould be, before I &s;et off." The truth is, he loitered behind, while he counterfeited exertion, pur|po&s;ely that the &s;uppo&s;ed lovers might be thrown into each other's arms.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;allies were interrupted by a knot of travellers, who were pa&s;&s;ing that part of the park, which &s;ir Armine left free for the accommodation of the public.</P>
<P>The wanderers had the attractions of in|di&s;putable
<PB N="12" REF="22">affliction, and of &s;ickne&s;s its too frequent attendant, &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed in their air, looks, and motions. Yet there was no external appearance of want in any of the groupe; all were habited neatly, and one of them bore a wallet laden with food: but the moment you beheld them, your own heart would have told you they were de&s;titute of comforts, which were not to be found in that wallet. There are certain &s;igns and tokens of mi&s;ery, &s;o vi&s;ible in the human form and countenance, that every man, without an in&s;ult upon the human character and under&s;tanding, mu&s;t &s;ee and feel them at a glance.</P>
<P>The groupe con&s;i&s;ted of an elderly man, leading a boy about twelve years old,&mdash;a woman, &s;omething under the age of the man, with a child at her back,&mdash;and a beau|tiful young woman, who, &s;ad and &s;orrowing, followed the re&s;t. As the fir&s;t and la&s;t men|tioned objects &s;tood by the &s;ide of the vene|rable Fitzorton, and the blooming Olivia, they exhibited, in &s;triking contra&s;t, the wonderful difference which &s;ickne&s;s and
<PB N="13" REF="23">health, happine&s;s and mi&s;ery, produce in beings of the &s;ame &s;pecies, and at the &s;ame period of life. "Plea&s;e your honours," &s;aid the old man, re&s;pectfully, "I hope we are not up|on tre&s;pa&s;s here; a man on the other &s;ide told us, there was a foot-way here to the place we are going: we have come clean from we&s;t to north, and are &s;omewhat foot|&s;ore; and every bit of ground &s;aved, there|fore, is &s;omething. Our Jane here, poor thing, can hardly drag one foot afore t'other: &s;o, as night is coming on, and we are not acquainted with the country here|abouts, may-hap your honours, who, I &s;up|po&s;e are ma&s;ters of thatun great hou&s;e, would be &s;o kind to give us barn-room, till the morning."&mdash;To this Partington made an&s;wer, "he was afraid the vagabonds had &s;taid in their own pari&s;h till they were driven out of it bag and baggage; and were living now by accident in a barn, or a &s;table, or the open field, as they could ma|nage it."&mdash;The old man an&s;wered, "Plea&s;e your wor&s;hip, none of us have been ever a burthen to the pari&s;h yet; and I hope, with
<PB N="14" REF="24">the ble&s;&s;ing of God upon our labour, we &s;ha'n't. But, we are burnt, &s;tick and &s;tone, out of our pari&s;h, where we lived upon our earnings, and a little matter be&s;ides, for the&s;e forty years. May be, your honour would like to hear a little about us. I am a ma&s;on, your honour,&mdash;&s;o I bought a bit of ground, and built a hou&s;e on him, and fur|ni&s;hed him, a thing at a time; and there 'twould have done your heart good, to &s;ee how we lived, till a &s;ort of quarrel be|twixt me and a great rich per&s;on, who has an e&s;tate thereabout, and has a hou&s;e like a town,&mdash;where nobody lives for a con&s;tan|cy, but a &s;avage old &s;ervant or two,&mdash;for the ma&s;ter only comes a week or two in the &s;pring &s;ea&s;on, or to gather rents, when the &s;teward, who, by the &s;ame token, is worth a hundred of his ma&s;ter, can't come down." &mdash;"God ble&s;s his goodne&s;s!" &s;aid the wo|man, who appeared to be the mother of the family: "if it had not been for <HI>him,</HI> I do be|lieve it would have been bad off for us long afore; for the baronet was pecking and pecking at us, years a-gone: our Jerom,
<PB N="15" REF="25">who is gone forward with the mule, got him&s;elf made a freeholder, and would not vote for a friend of this great baronight&mdash; for he is one who is <HI>'titled</HI> to do as he likes with poor folk,&mdash;<HI>bore</HI> us all a grudge."&mdash;"And &s;omehow or other, your wor&s;hip," re|&s;umed the old man, "about Augu&s;t, in the &s;ummer after, I &s;hut up hou&s;e, whil&s;t I and dame and young&s;ter went a making a little harve&s;ting at friend Arm&s;trong's, a cou&s;in of my wife's, who has a bit of a farm, and who wi&s;hed me to bring all my family; and as we could make our&s;elves tolerably tight and &s;mart at that time, we rigged our&s;elves out, and off we went; but when we got home from merry-making,&mdash;(what a world it is, your wor&s;hip!)&mdash;I &s;aw the top of my hou&s;e where the bottom &s;hould be, and the walls as black as my hat."&mdash;"Why, Reuben," exclaimed the wife! "how can you be &s;o milk-livered and mealy-mouthed, Reuben? Plea&s;e your wor&s;hip, as &s;ure as you &s;tand there, this great baronet, I told you about, &s;et it a-fire."&mdash;"O impo&s;&s;ible!" cried Olivia.&mdash;"Set it a-fire, Mi&s;s, I &s;ay," re|&s;umed
<PB N="16" REF="26">the wi&s;e, emphatically &s;lapping her hands together: "and I'll tell him &s;o to his head, and bring all my ruinated family in my hand, to <HI>&s;hew</HI> him what he has done; for we left neither fire nor candle: and I'll take my affy-david that I put up the &s;hut|ters, and locked the door, and clapt the key in our pockets, and the &s;ame to the little garden gate; and God knows, the keys are all now we have for it: here they are, your wor&s;hip: aye, and they &s;hall go <HI>with</HI> us to the wicked wretch, though all the keys in the world can't open his heart, becau&s;e it is harder than they: but a' &s;hall hear on't; and if there is law in the land, he &s;hall ha' it."&mdash; "Hold your tongue, Sal!" &s;aid the old man: "I don't think, Sir Devil's-come, as we call him in our parts, would go to &s;et a man's hou&s;e on fire, when there wa'n't a &s;oul in it, either to plea&s;e or to tea&s;e him, or to &s;ay, why do ye &s;o? though to be &s;ure my hou&s;e, as I &s;aid, is down, and all that was in it, burned or moved off; and what was wor&s;e, I had put into a drawer a little modukin of money, &s;hillings and half crowns at a time,&mdash;
<PB N="17" REF="27">now and then a golden guinea; and they are gone too; though I have been pottering about with my &s;tick, and my family have all been on their knees grubbing i' the a&s;hes; but it was all to no purpo&s;e. This fellow would have gone to pot too," continued the old man, pointing to a curl-tail black dog that followed him, "and &s;o would the kitten un|der our Jenny's arm there, if we had not luckily put &s;he to 'bide with Goody Brab|&s;on, a neighbour of ours; &s;o here is the whole family, your honour, counting Jerom and Dorothy."&mdash;Olivia, who had before put a trifle into the young woman's hand, now &s;troked the kitten; and Henry, long before the &s;tory had arrived at this &s;tage, had made his offering; James, patted the dog, called him a lucky fellow, and a&s;&s;ured him, con&s;idering &s;uch dangers, he had a very narrow e&s;cape. At the &s;ugge&s;tion of the hou&s;e being maliciou&s;ly &s;et on fire, every particle of blood that &s;upplied the body of Parting|ton, flew in his face; he cried out, "O that the worthy baronet had been in the middle of the flames! I would have &s;et fire to my
<PB N="18" REF="28">own hou&s;e, to have had him in the centre! but I don't believe a word on't! it's a lye! it mu&s;t be a lye! I <HI>will have</HI> it a lye! Are you &s;ure, fellow, you did not &s;ee it on fire <HI>your&s;elf?</HI> And why do you keep that child, woman, &s;winging at your back all this time, when there is &s;uch a fine &s;oft bank by the &s;ide of you, and the gra&s;s full of flow|ers, and as dry as my walking-&s;tick?" Here Partington loo&s;ed the bandages, took the infant in his arms, repeating, "An&s;wer me that! an&s;wer me that! down with ye, down with every one,&mdash;you two old &s;inners, in particular,"&mdash;Partington appearing to bend them to the ground forcibly, but, in truth, lowering them with all po&s;&s;ible gentlene&s;s. "As for you," continued he, "good peo|ple," addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to his own party, "the evening begins to draw in: the dew falls: &s;ee how your fine neckcloths and handkerchiefs &s;hrink at it:&mdash;&s;un-flowers can bear nothing but fair weather:&mdash;the dew won't &s;uit your gouty limbs, you old &s;coun|drel,"&mdash;to Sir Armine&mdash;"nor your delicate ancles, Mrs. Abominable,"&mdash;to Olivia&mdash;"the

All this time they had been moving, or ra|ther Partington had been pu&s;hing them for|wards: and as the Clares and Fitzortons knew the poor creatures would be left in good hands, they bent their &s;teps back to|wards the ca&s;tle.</P>

<P>"GOOD heaven!" exclaimed Olivia to her father, as the party were walking home, "do you think there ever was &s;uch a &s;hock|ing thing done in the world, as for a per&s;on to &s;et fire to his neighbour's hou&s;e on pur|po&s;e? I have read of &s;uch horrid actions in new&s;papers, and once, I think, in a book, but never believed either to be po&s;&s;ible; in|deed, I felt a kind of di&s;gu&s;t at the author of &s;uch incredible fictions."</P>
<P>"It is almo&s;t a &s;in, my &s;weet girl," &s;aid Mr. Clare, "to de&s;troy your opinion of human kind, formed on the ba&s;is of your own inno|cence. Painful as it is to oppo&s;e the wi&s;dom of experience to the bli&s;sful &s;implicity of a pure and unpracti&s;ed heart,&mdash;I have known more in&s;tances than one of it."</P>
<P>"Yet we &s;eldom&mdash;I never did," re&s;umed Olivia, "hear of people coming to an un|timely end for the&s;e horrid crimes."&mdash;"That too is among&s;t the vices of the times," re|joined Sir Armine. "People make their for|tunes
<PB N="21" REF="31">now-a-days by being <HI>ruined and un|done.</HI> In a few months after the&s;e <HI>lucky mis|fortunes,</HI> we behold new trades carried on by tho&s;e who had been turned pennyle&s;s out of their &s;hops: and we &s;ee new hou&s;es ri&s;ing, like &s;o many phoenixes, out of the a&s;hes of the old."</P>
<P>"My dear girl," cried her father, "who can detail the hi&s;tory of modern inventions in the art of living?&mdash;There is, comparative|ly, a poor livelihood, child, now to be picked up out of the real mi&s;eries of life; but luxury and independence pour in their &s;tores on the de&s;igning;&mdash;thus, &s;ome impo|&s;itions are a decent maintenance, and others a very comfortable &s;inecure: in &s;hort, to make <HI>fictitious di&s;tre&s;s</HI> the in&s;trument of <HI>real good fortune,</HI> is among&s;t the mo&s;t dextrous refinements of this improving age; vice is always at work, and works with the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s on the &s;en&s;ibility of virtue."</P>
<P>"Dreadful!" exclaimed Olivia. "But I cannot think the poor creatures we have ju&s;t left, are of this de&s;cription; for, &s;urely, that old mi&s;erable man, who a&s;ked for nothing
<PB N="22" REF="32">but the charity of a bed of &s;traw in our barn, could not trump up &s;uch a fal&s;ehood again&s;t the per&s;on he &s;poke of;&mdash;and, indeed, I have blamed my&s;elf, every &s;tep I have come, that I did not beg my deare&s;t Sir Armine to let him have &s;ome comfortable place to re&s;t his family to-night:&mdash;the young woman re|ally looked ready to &s;ink into the earth with fatigue; and yet &s;he kept the poor kitten in her arms; and I heard her a&s;k her mother to let her carry the child, twenty times.&mdash;Indeed, indeed, Mr. Partington judges too har&s;hly of them! Gracious hea|ven! Henry, if the world is half &s;o wicked as you and your brother John have painted it to me, I do not &s;ee how &s;uch a &s;impleton as your Olivia is to live in it."</P>
<P>Here the lovely girl ran to Henry, and, placing her&s;elf betwixt him, her own fa|ther, and Sir Armine, &s;he &s;aid, in a tone that might have taught hypocri&s;y to forego its victim, "Well! thank God! while I am thus protected, not all the bad people in the world can do me any harm!" &s;aying which, &s;he entwined her arms, and clung
<PB N="23" REF="33">towards her parent and lover, as if &s;he felt her&s;elf in a &s;anctuary.</P>
<P>"But," &s;aid James, with his u&s;ual good &s;en&s;e and moderation, "the mi&s;eries of hu|man life, induced by <HI>inevitable</HI> misfortunes, are, alas! &s;o manifold, and &s;o various, that the &s;oul is not to be frozen up, becau&s;e vice can a&s;&s;ume the appearance of virtue in di|&s;tre&s;s, and, by applying to the &s;ame &s;ource, may partake of the &s;ame bountiful &s;tream."</P>
<P>"Re&s;pecting the wretched family we have been talking with," &s;aid Henry, "we have all &s;een they are both &s;ick and &s;orrowful, my deare&s;t father: and I dare pledge my|&s;elf, every tittle of their &s;tory is true."&mdash;"Truth may, perhaps, lie between," in|terpo&s;ed James.&mdash;"I would go barefoot a thou&s;and leagues," exclaimed Henry, "to puni&s;h the author of their ruin; but if, hav|ing found him, he was evidently under the pre&s;&s;ure of any heart-wringing mi&s;ery, pin|ing with want, or wa&s;ting in di&s;ea&s;e, I hope I &s;hould do what I could to comfort him."&mdash;"It is certainly right," &s;aid James, half con|ceding, "to take care that vice does not run
<PB N="24" REF="34">away with the perqui&s;ite of virtue: but it is, neverthele&s;s, better that they &s;hould divide our bounty, than that, from &s;ear of encou|raging the one, we &s;hould refu&s;e to reward the other."</P>
<P>"The virtue of de&s;igning well," &s;aid Sir Armine, with a deciding voice, as he reached the portico of the ca&s;tle, "if it fails of &s;ome, is &s;eldom deprived of all its rewards.&mdash;Let the honourable pa&s;&s;ions and emotions of our frame declare the unrivalled privileges of a gentle and un&s;u&s;picious heart:&mdash;let the power which it gives us, in the energies of our loves and friend&s;hips, pronounce its eu|logy:&mdash;let pity, charity, candour, benevo|lence, ea&s;ine&s;s to believe the be&s;t, and tar|dine&s;s to credit the wor&s;t,&mdash;yea, and the &s;weet, very &s;weet, &s;implicity that &s;ometimes conducts us to the precipice down which we are hurled by the villain guide,&mdash;let even the pure and innocent heart it&s;elf, through all its meanders of &s;en&s;ibility,&mdash;let it, in vi|brations of tran&s;port, declare, it is the prime delight of man, and the choice&s;t gift of God."</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="35">Olivia here pre&s;&s;ed the hand of her fa|ther, then that of Sir Armine, upon her heart; "You have now all &s;ettled it &s;o en|tirely to my &s;atisfaction, and have brought me again into &s;uch good humour with that world, which &s;ome of you had almo&s;t put me out of conceit with, that I will not &s;tay to hear another word."&mdash;The whole compa|ny went into the hou&s;e.</P>

<P>"IT is among the wonders of the world, when I wonder," quoth Partington, to the family in the park: "and yet I mu&s;t confe&s;s, the audaciou&s;ne&s;s of your telling that impudent lye about &s;ome worthy gen|tleman's burning down your hou&s;e, becau&s;e you would not vote again&s;t your con&s;cience, does throw, even me, into a&s;toni&s;hment."&mdash;"Sir," an&s;wered the old man, with &s;ome dignity, "I do not pretend to &s;ay it is &s;o for &s;artain: but Goody Brab&s;on is ready to &s;wear it; for &s;he was di&s;turbed the night before, and &s;aw ill-looking fellows lurking about;
<PB N="26" REF="36">and before that day come-week, my hou&s;e was down;&mdash;but as for a lye, I don't know whether I would tell one to have it built <HI>up</HI> again."&mdash;"No!" an&s;wered Partington:&mdash;"then give me your hand, you &s;coundrel!"&mdash;"But, for that matter," re&s;umed the old man, "there are hotter doings at electioneering, than burning down poor men's hou&s;es.&mdash;Why, ble&s;s your wor&s;hip, I have &s;een the candidates, as they call them&s;elves, ready to &s;et fire to one, another."&mdash;"Aye, your honour," interpo&s;ed the old man's wife, "that's not half the mi&s;chief! there was &s;omething wor&s;e than 'lection riots in this affair:&mdash;naughty Jenny there, and this poor brat at my back, if it could &s;peak, could tell you all about that."&mdash;Here the young woman whom &s;he called Jenny, made &s;igns for her mother to keep &s;ilence; upon which the mother exclaimed, "Hu&s;&s;y, I will &s;peak! his honour here &s;hall know who are &s;coun|drels, and who are not! Mayhap his honour is a ju&s;tice of the peace, and will give us &s;ome law.&mdash;An' plea&s;e your wor&s;hip, that ba|ronet is the father of this babe; after my
<PB N="27" REF="37">Reuben had refu&s;ed his vote, this baronet grew &s;o kind, that we thought, God help us he repented his <HI>ha&s;hne&s;s</HI> to us; where|upon I was a kind of a char-woman now and then at the great hou&s;e, when he came down for a week or two: and if I was wanted at home, why, I &s;ent Jenny there, backwards and forwards, as well &s;poken and like&s;ome a girl, your honour, aye, and as &s;hame-faced then, and for that matter now, tho' &s;he has had a ba&s;tard, as any &s;he of the country;&mdash;and &s;o, behold ye', this villain of a baronet was only kind for the &s;ake of &s;he; and, behold ye, he contrived to get to the &s;ight and &s;peech of her, and &s;oon put the girl a&s;ide her|&s;elf; &s;he could talk of nothing but the baro|net:&mdash;the baronet told her this&mdash;the baronet gave her that!&mdash;I believe in my con&s;cience he turned her &s;illy head, and over&s;et her in &s;uch a way, that &s;he was crazy enough to think of becoming my lady:&mdash;aye, and he put a new golden ring on her finger, and called her wife&mdash;though he was married before, and, they do &s;ay, to a <HI>moral</HI> of a woman&mdash;not that he ever brought maddam down&mdash;and he per&s;uaded
<PB N="28" REF="38">&s;illy Jane &s;he was dead&mdash;thof a maddam he had there too; and there &s;he comes at times &s;till, for a month in the &s;ummer, and &s;ays &s;he's the baronet's cozen&mdash;marry come up! a dainty cozen! I warrant, &s;he cozens his virtuous wife finely. But to return to our Jenney:&mdash;Reuben and I began to think it odd the girl &s;hould get &s;o much into favour, &s;eeing how we were hated before: but we &s;till were fools enough to believe that Sir Gui&s;e &mdash;"</P>
<P>"Sir Gui&s;e!" exclaimed Partington: "is <HI>he</HI> the baronet? It's all true,&mdash;get up&mdash;tell the re&s;t of your &s;tory as you go along. I &s;ee you are a pack of &s;ad &s;coundrels; and I &s;hall in&s;i&s;t upon Fitzorton's hou&s;e covering all of you &s;omewhere until morning. And do you hear, girl?&mdash;Jane, I think is your name&mdash;do you lean on my arm; and do you, mother Blab, take hold of the other arm&mdash;you, young varlet, keep clo&s;e by your father&mdash;hu&s;&s;y, keep you by your mother&mdash;but as to the &s;uckling, you mu&s;t carry that &s;in your&s;elf, Jane; for the devil &s;educe me if I touch any thing belonging to that pretty gentleman,
<PB N="29" REF="39">unle&s;s I &s;hould have the felicity of tucking him up under the gallows. Well, but that happy day may come yet!"</P>
<P>Partington had the family all up on the march before he had got to the ejaculation with which he fini&s;hed his harangue,&mdash;and di&s;po&s;ed the &s;everal per&s;ons in the order de&s;cribed. In this manner they were mov|ing along towards the ca&s;tle, when they encountered Henry, who, partly in con&s;e|quence of Olivia's whi&s;per, and partly to gratify his own curio&s;ity,&mdash;or, perhaps, from a better principle,&mdash;was returning to the &s;pot where he left the groupe. Without relating &s;tories, or entering into cau&s;es, Partington ordered Henry to run as fa&s;t as his legs would carry him back to the ca&s;tle, order a comfortable &s;upper, but not among the &s;ervants, and half a dozen well aired beds, and tell old &s;quare-toes it was his command:&mdash;"Nay that 'tis the old caitiff's duty," &s;aid he; "for here is ju&s;tice bu&s;ine&s;s enough for a whole &s;e&s;&s;ions; and moreover, if he don't chu&s;e to accommodate them, come back again and tell me &s;o, that I may
<PB N="30" REF="40">take them to the Fitzorton-arms public hou&s;e; for they &s;hall not go out of my cu&s;to|dy till I &s;ift the affair to the bottom; and as it's moon-light, a mile or two more le&s;s, for good &s;uppers and good beds, can make lit|tle difference."&mdash;Henry, who was ever rea|dy to a&s;&s;i&s;t the unfortunate, without paining them by a recital of di&s;tre&s;sful &s;tories, ha&s;ted, without a&s;king a &s;ingle que&s;tion, to execute his commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Partington returned to the travellers, who began to think him in&s;ane, and put him|&s;elf nearly in his former &s;ituation, with the difference only of taking the child gently from the young woman, who had been giv|ing it &s;uck, and &s;aying, at the &s;ame time, "Come, as that little ra&s;cal may one day be brought in evidence again&s;t its virtuous father, I think I will give it a lift: and &s;o go on with your walk and your &s;tory, old cai|tiff."</P>
<P>"As I was &s;aying then, your wor&s;hip, we fooli&s;hly thought Sir Gui&s;e Stuart&mdash;" "Proceed," cried Partington, "if you can, without any more mentioning that worthy
<PB N="31" REF="41">gentleman's name, for it puts me in a fever: call him&mdash;call him&mdash;baronet."</P>
<P>"The baronet, then," an&s;wered Mrs. At|wood, "was never ea&s;y but when &s;ome of us was at the great hou&s;e; he wanted Reu|ben to give up ma&s;onry:&mdash;we &s;taid in the pari&s;h a twelve-month after the fire, with Goody Brab&s;on:&mdash;the baronet wi&s;hed us to take one of his farms,&mdash;&s;ometimes he &s;aid he would pull down the great hou&s;e, and build up a finer, which would do for his &s;on, when he married, and give Reuben the job: and as for Jenny, I don't know what he was to do for &s;he,&mdash;he would take her to his other great &s;eat in the&s;e parts;&mdash;I never was there, your honour; but I <HI>will</HI> be there, and &s;ooner than he thinks.&mdash;Well, he would pull this other down, and let her live with mi&s;s&mdash;mi&s;s Caroline:&mdash;&s;o we e'en let her go; and coil enough there was about it, from Reuben, who had been told by neighbours, what would become of it; however, I thought it for the be&s;t; and away &s;he went."</P>
<P>"Accur&s;ed be the hour &s;he did!" &s;aid Reuben.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="42">"Don't interrupt her, you vagabond," cried Partington, doubling his fi&s;ts,&mdash;not at Reuben, however, nor at any per&s;on pre|&s;ent.</P>
<P>"The up&s;hot of it was, an' plea&s;e your wor&s;hip, that one Valentine Miles, a man that u&s;ed to do all Sir Gui&s;e's&mdash;I beg your honour's pardon, I mean&mdash;the&mdash;the&mdash;baro|net's dirty work, &s;uch as pounding our &s;trays, &s;uing for rents, and the like,&mdash;Miles, I &s;ay, your honour, took Jane, as he &s;aid, to Gui&s;e Abbey; but in fact, far enough a|field from that: he carried her up to London; always calling her my lady&mdash;and, as the fooli&s;h girl was in love, &s;he believed it:&mdash; and for that matter, &s;he lived like a lady, &s;ure enough&mdash;lady's maids, lady's livery-men, and what not!&mdash;no wonder, your wor&s;hip, poor Jane believed it all go&s;pel, for I thought it &s;o my&s;elf&mdash;for <HI>a'ter</HI> this, he had her married over again: but that was &s;ham too, ju&s;t like the ring bu&s;ine&s;s <HI>afore;</HI> for the fellow who married her, was as little of a par&s;on, and as great a rogue, as him&s;elf:&mdash;&s;o your wor|&s;hip &s;ees the end on't&mdash;this poor boy!&mdash;"
<PB N="33" REF="43">"Whew!" whi&s;tled Partington.&mdash;"And we might have lived in ignorance, and &s;he in wickedne&s;s, poor thing, a great while longer," continued the afflicted father, ca|re&s;&s;ing his betrayed daughter, "had not &s;omebody &s;ent us a <HI>nonmus</HI> letter, as they call it, &s;aying our daughter was a double U, Sir Gui&s;e Stuart an R&mdash;and the child a B&mdash;."</P>
<P>Partington here gave the old ma&s;on an|other &s;hake by the hand, and then bade the wife proceed.</P>
<P>She then related a variety of other hei|nous particulars, unfolding the villany of Sir Gui&s;e and his agents, and ending with the recovery of the deluded Jenny to the arms of her family. "Yes, your honour," &s;aid Mrs. Atwood, in conclu&s;ion&mdash;"and &s;o this very day was &s;ix weeks brought Jenny and her brat home to us again, dre&s;&s;ed in the very gown &s;he went away in,&mdash;a good &s;tuff of <HI>our own hone&s;t buying,</HI> and which &s;he has got on, you &s;ee, at this pre&s;ent.&mdash;But, with the ble&s;&s;ing upon us, we'll make the baronet a&s;hamed of it yet; for we are going
<PB N="34" REF="44">to &s;ettle, not pa&s;&s;ing more than thirteen or fourteen miles on t'other &s;ide of his abbey; and we have come a matter of that about, purpo&s;ely to tell him a piece of our mind: and if your wor&s;hip can do any thing in this affair, give us &s;ome ju&s;tice; for we'll have none of his money: &s;o far contrary, indeed, that one of the mule's paniers, with Jerom, is loaded with all the things,&mdash;&s;ome of 'em pretty &s;mart ones too,&mdash;that he gave us be|fore Jenny went from us.&mdash;As to the fine clothes, and trinkum-trankums he gave &s;he, they were all left behind at the wicked place where we found her."</P>
<P>Their walk and their recital ended toge|ther; for they had now arrived at the ca&s;tle, where they were again met by Henry, who told Partington, all things would be done as he had directed.&mdash;"Then lead the way," &s;aid Partington; "for the&s;e are much greater vagabonds than you think, and mu&s;t be taken care of accordingly."</P>
<P>Henry conducted them to a large apart|ment adjoining the &s;teward's.&mdash;Partington u&s;hered them in, ordered the &s;ervant to
<PB N="35" REF="45">place chairs,&mdash;a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the bu&s;ine&s;s him&s;elf, ob&s;erving, that, "though they were vaga|bonds, they were every one to be treated with the utmo&s;t re&s;pect."&mdash;He de&s;ired them to eat, drink, and be merry,&mdash;to be in good humour with one another; but, above all things, not to &s;ay a &s;ingle cro&s;s word to that good-for-nothing hu&s;&s;y, Jane; and to take care that the child had &s;ome pap.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI.</HEAD>
<P>HENRY and Partington returned to the company, where Olivia was &s;till pre|&s;iding at the tea-table, declaring Mr. Part|ington &s;hould not go without his u&s;ual be|verage. This was a pint ba&s;on filled with tea, and milk, and honey, in equal propor|tions. "If you would not have me choaked with rage, give me the <HI>&s;lop!</HI>"&mdash;&s;o he always called it:&mdash;and &s;eeing the ba&s;on before him, he &s;pilled one part of it, and &s;wallowed the other; then taking breath, he threw him&s;elf into a chair, the blood &s;tarting into his face, while he recited the hi&s;tory of the Atwoods,
<PB N="36" REF="46">making no other variations than di&s;tingui&s;h|ing Sir Gui&s;e by the words "fine fellow! pretty gentleman! the hero of the tale!". But, though the&s;ee pithets were not bitter in language, they were intolerably &s;o in the manner of their delivery: for, at the men|tion of his atrocities, he would &s;ometimes leap up, take the room at a couple of &s;trides, exclaiming to a chair, to a table, to one of the company, or even to his own &s;hadow in the gla&s;s, &s;uppo&s;ing it were Sir Gui&s;e, "Your mo&s;t obedient very humble &s;ervant, my no|ble baronet! I tru&s;t your execution is not very far off; for other facts are coming out, I dare &s;ay; and all the crimes of human na|ture will conduct your honour to Tyburn, I flatter my&s;elf! Would to heaven they could all be bundled with you into the &s;ame cart, that you might be put out of the world to|gether! I would empty my cellar,&mdash;aye, and almo&s;t my &s;trong box too,&mdash;to celebrate that glorious event."</P>
<P>The effect which the narration had upon the company, was various. Lady Fitzorton lifted up her hands, and wept &s;ilently.&mdash;Mr.
<PB N="37" REF="47">Clare exclaimed, "Execrable wretch!"&mdash; Sir Armine knit his brows, and &s;aid, "Poor Charles! what does he not de&s;erve, to atone for the cur&s;e of &s;uch a parent?"&mdash;Olivia &s;aid, "The poor girl and child de&s;erved every care, that innocence betrayed, and helple&s;s infancy, could receive from pity."&mdash;"The&s;e old caitiffs too have their merits," cried Par|tington. "But what can be a &s;ufficient tri|bute of admiration for Mi&s;s Stuart?" ex|claimed Olivia&mdash;"&s;o good! &s;o con&s;iderate!&mdash; how, my dear Henry, &s;hall we do honour to her?"&mdash;Henry held his tongue, and &s;pake no|thing, yet looked as if he &s;ub&s;cribed fully to the eulogy.</P>
<P>Partington, however, was the mo&s;t bu&s;y of the groupe. His hands, head, and heart, &s;eemed to be full; and he divided the even|ing between his in&s;ufferable &s;coundrels above &s;tairs, and his abominable vagabonds below.</P>
<P>Olivia, too, frequently &s;tole out, and whi&s;|pering Henry, who always di&s;appeared &s;oon after, ha&s;ted to Partington's gue&s;ts; and, under pretence of a&s;king if they had every
<PB N="38" REF="48">thing comfortable about them, took occa|&s;ion to &s;hew many little marks of a generous nature and of genuine good-will.</P>
<P>She had particularly directed her own maid to provide all things proper for the child, and would have &s;ent to the manor-hou&s;e for her own cradle, but was prevented by Henry, who reminded her there were &s;e|veral in the ca&s;tle.&mdash;"Gracious! perhaps your own&mdash;what an honour, if we could procure that!" exclaimed Olivia: "the poor babe is innocent, you know: alas! and its mother can &s;carcely be called guilty, my Henry."&mdash;She took care that a comfortable change of every thing was provided from her own wardrobe, and placed ready for Jane Atwood, in her bed-chamber; nor was &s;he unmindful of the re&s;t, in &s;uch little additions as might be proper to the general happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Prior again to this, true George had been di&s;patched by Partington to the ea&s;tern gate of the park, at which Atwood's elde&s;t &s;on Jerom, with Dorothy, was appointed to wait his family's joining him.&mdash;"The boy
<PB N="39" REF="49">will &s;tand &s;tock at the gate, plea&s;e your wor|&s;hip," &s;aid old Atwood, as he overheard Partington giving directions: "he <HI>&s;aid</HI> he would, thof it were for a couple of nights. I never &s;ee'd &s;uch a boy for that: bid 'un do a thing: and if he an&s;wers 'Aye,' the thing's done; but then again, if he gives you one of his <HI>noes,</HI> i'cod, your wor&s;hip, he's more of a mule than Dorothy!"</P>
<P>"I &s;ee into the vagabond's character at once," replied Partington. "Go then, George: you will find him &s;tuck to the gate; and if he won't leave it, take Armine's team, and bring gate and all."</P>
<P>True George, when he had a good-natured thing to do, never addicted him&s;elf to unne|ce&s;&s;ary delays, and was, be&s;ides, one of the mo&s;t active young fellows in the world. He &s;et off, therefore, for the ea&s;tern gate, as if his own bed and board depended on his di|&s;patch.</P>
<P>To confe&s;s the truth, this hone&s;t fellow had been more in the &s;ecrets of Atwood's family than any other of the &s;ervants. In|deed, he was a youth of mo&s;t in&s;atiable cu|rio&s;ity,
<PB N="40" REF="50">where the gratification thereof had but the probable a&s;pect of being attended by a good office; in &s;earching after which, he was indefatigable. And judging from his beloved ma&s;ter Henry's &s;econd vi&s;it to the park, by moon-light too, that &s;ome new ad|venture was near, he had contrived to take his u&s;ual &s;tation of an out-po&s;t, for fear of being di&s;covered. By a little <HI>bu&s;h</HI>-fighting, however, which is extremely honourable, he formed his ambu&s;cade behind &s;ome flow|ering thorns, which grew in that part of the park where Mr. Partington recapitulated, in an audible voice, &s;o much of the At|woods' &s;tory as had then been told.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>WERE it our intention to give to each of the heroes and heroines of this epic hi&s;|tory a day of prowe&s;s, after the manner of the great Maeonides, who dedicated one book of his Iliad to Ajax, another to Aga|memnon, and &s;o on,&mdash;we &s;hould certainly con&s;ecrate this chapter to the achievements
<PB N="41" REF="51">of Olivia, who, from the orient &s;un, even to his down-going, and again to his up|ri&s;ing, was employed in doing at lea&s;t as much good as any illu&s;trious ancient or mo|dern, whom fable or truth has yet celebrated, were we to begin with Philip of Macedon, and end with Frederick of Pru&s;&s;ia; and we do not at all deem it unrea&s;onable to declare that we expect, the very abridgment of her acts, during the abovementioned &s;pace, will make the reader more in love with her, though rehear&s;ed in humble pro&s;e, than if, in imitation of tho&s;e royal butchers, &s;he had laid a thou&s;and of her fellow creatures, with her own hand, dead at her feet, in the field of battle.</P>
<P>The day, then, of the fair Olivia Clare, was u&s;hered in by an act, mild and lovely as the fir&s;t ray of the morn which &s;hone on it,&mdash;even by an early walk round the garden with the unfortunate Jane Atwood. Luck|le&s;s victim! thy mode&s;t appearance and blu&s;hing graces, and all the deep regrets of downca&s;t con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s &s;treaming from thy eyes; thy keen &s;en&s;e of the <HI>novelty</HI> of a vir|tuous
<PB N="42" REF="52">woman &s;oothing and not aggravating the fate of a woman betrayed,&mdash;ju&s;tified thy mother's de&s;cription, and made the com|pa&s;&s;ion and loving kindne&s;s of thy protec|tre&s;s a virtue worthy to be imitated by thy &s;ex! a &s;ex, too often cruel and unrelenting to mo&s;t pitiable victims.&mdash;After &s;everal turns about the walks, Olivia conducted her &s;till trembling proteg&eacute;e to the breakfa&s;t-room, where the Atwoods had been invited by Sir Armine to join the family: but &s;eeming to feel them&s;elves farther from home there than in the apartment where they had pa&s;&s;ed the preceding evening, they were again committed to the care of Partington and true George.</P>
<P>Olivia, under&s;tanding this, begged permi&s;|&s;ion to &s;eat Jane between Henry and her&s;elf, &s;aying in a whi&s;per to her father, "Becau&s;e, you know, we can comfort and make her chearful." Be&s;ides the &s;hyne&s;s which only an intercour&s;e with the world can remove, a painful con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her error, and of the knowledge which the company had of it, made the timid Jane di&s;cover &s;o much un|ea&s;ine&s;s,
<PB N="43" REF="53">that the good-natured Olivia per|ceiving it, led her fir&s;t to the window, and then out at the door, &s;aying, "her young friend was not very well, and, though &s;en&s;i|ble of the honour intended her, wi&s;hed to take breakfa&s;t with her own family." Par|tington's propo&s;al to blend the Atwoods and Fitzortons at breakfa&s;t, was among&s;t the ge|nerous little incon&s;i&s;tencies or rather indi&s;|criminations which were interwoven into his character, in&s;omuch that you would &s;ometimes &s;ee at his table per&s;ons whom, from their difference of character and condition, any man who attended to the ceremonies of the world, and indeed to the di&s;tinctions of ranks in &s;ociety, would have thought it im|po&s;&s;ible he could bring together. But the &s;ame objection by no means held again&s;t the propriety of Olivia bringing this young wo|man into &s;o much good company:&mdash;the be&s;t and mo&s;t ju&s;tifiable motives influenced the fair protectre&s;s; and there was a natural grace and gentility about the no le&s;s fair protected, which Sir Gui&s;e, in giving her the be&s;t ma&s;ters, had not a little improved. In truth,
<PB N="44" REF="54">Jane attributed her misfortune, and all its fatal con&s;equences, to the violence of the baronet's pa&s;&s;ion for her; and &s;he looked on the mock nuptials as &s;o &s;olemn a pledge of his love, that &s;he her&s;elf encouraged the wi&s;h of Sir Gui&s;e, that the union &s;hould re|main &s;ecret, from an idea which &s;prung from the purity of her affection, that having the joy to tell her own heart he was her wed|ded lord, &s;he had rather continue to be thought her&s;elf di&s;honoured, than that he &s;hould be degraded. Her father's finding and carrying her off, &s;he long con&s;idered as the &s;ole cau&s;e by which &s;he had been &s;epa|rated from the baronet:&mdash;and although none of the&s;e motives wholly obliterated the inward &s;en&s;e of her fir&s;t indi&s;cretion prior to her &s;uppo&s;ed honourable union, or &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed the &s;igh &s;o often as &s;he turned her thoughts towards her de&s;erted father and his family,&mdash;&s;he cheared her&s;elf by reflecting that if ever &s;he &s;hould qualify her&s;elf &s;o as to ju&s;tify Sir Gui&s;e in owning her as his lawful la|dy, all would &s;till be well. In&s;pired by the ex|pectation of &s;uch a reward,&mdash;&s;he applied with
<PB N="45" REF="55">unwearied diligence to whatever might render her more attracting in manners, and cultur|ed in mind.&mdash;Her grand object, in attempt|ing the adornment of both, was, to de&s;erve the honour which &s;he believed Sir Gui&s;e had conferred on her; and to enable him to acknowledge her with le&s;s comparative di&s;|grace: &mdash;and as the baronet &s;ometimes found relief in her gentlene&s;s, from the violence of Mrs. Tempe&s;t, and the di&s;turbance of his thoughts on his u&s;age to the real Lady Stuart,&mdash;his kind treatment of her made her &s;till lay much of his deception to his fear of lo&s;ing her by a di&s;covery of the truth; and although her parents, more e&s;pecially her mother, never uttered his name without annexing to it a cur&s;e,&mdash;&s;he acknowledged to Olivia in the garden, that, although &s;he too well knew &s;he had her&s;elf acted very wrong, &s;he did not believe he was half &s;o bad as people repre&s;ented him. "This I mu&s;t &s;ay: though, except we happen to meet with him at home this morning, I mu&s;t never hope, and indeed, I do not&mdash;de&mdash;de|&s;ire &mdash;that is&mdash;I do not&mdash;<HI>ought</HI> to de&s;ire, ever
<PB N="46" REF="56">to &s;ee him more."&mdash;"This morning, child?" que&s;tioned Olivia: "what do you mean?"&mdash; "Yes, madam, my father and mother, and my brother Jerom, are determined to &s;ee him; and&mdash;and Jerom &s;wore on his knees&mdash; But what good can it do, madam, to drag me before his family? And then my brother is &s;o pa&s;&s;ionate!&mdash;If, indeed, Sir Gui&s;e could be &s;ent for to any other place but his own hou&s;e&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;talked&mdash;to&mdash;about me, or about the poor child&mdash;or if&mdash;if&mdash;I&mdash;if &mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;"</P>
<P>Here grief awhile choaked her utterance. &mdash;"Not that my father," added &s;he, "would &s;uffer either of us to receive another farthing of his money: he would &s;ooner work his poor fingers to the bone; nay, all which Jerom has in one of tho&s;e great panniers, are pre&s;ents &s;ent by Sir Gui&s;e or my&s;elf, from town, &s;ince I imagined, alas! my&s;elf, and a&s;&s;ured them, I was his &s;acred though &s;ecret wife; and my father and brother have worked night and day for the&s;e four months pa&s;t,&mdash;indeed, ever &s;ince they knew of my di&s;appointment,&mdash;and almo&s;t &s;tarved them|&s;elves,

She &s;aw the agonies into which the information threw me, and tried to &s;ooth them;&mdash;ah! why are not all good people, all virtuous ladies, &s;o mild as her when they &s;peak to&mdash;to unhappy women?

<P>Here the tender and afflicted Jane talked to the infant, ki&s;&s;ed, and wept over it, while Olivia experienced &s;trong emotions of grief, love, and admiration, as well for the friend of her infancy, Mi&s;s Stuart, as for the mo|ther and the child.</P>

<P>UPON the return of Olivia to the break|fa&s;ting parlour, which was immediately after &s;he had placed Jenny more at her ea&s;e with her own family, &s;he &s;eated her&s;elf, even though her beloved Henry was in the room, between Mr. Clare and Sir Armine; and in that &s;ituation recapitulated, with great fide|lity,&mdash;but with many comments and illu&s;tra|tions, &s;upplied from that rich repo&s;itory, her own good mind,&mdash;all that had pa&s;&s;ed be|tween

<P>We mu&s;t, in truth, leave this matter, as we have done many others, to the reader's own imagination.&mdash;If he has been, or is, a lover, he will not be at a lo&s;s to conjecture; &mdash;if he has not, he may be &s;till able, faintly, to judge what a young man of an ardent temper, and under Henry's circum&s;tances, would be likely to feel on &s;uch an occa|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Be it noted al&s;o, to the honour of Olivia,
<PB N="55" REF="65">that in her recital &s;he &s;unk upon her little auditory, probably in con&s;ideration of Hen|ry's friend&s;hip for Charles Stuart, as many of the indefen&s;ible parts of the baronet's con|duct as &s;he could; or, rather, &s;he gave to truth its mo&s;t candid form. At this mo|ment Partington entered the room, took a chair, and &s;at thoughtfully down. "To let the Atwoods meet the Stuarts, you know," &mdash;&s;aid Olivia, addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to Lady Fitzorton, and looking at the old gentle|men, &mdash;"would be little &s;hort of actual mad|ne&s;s, &mdash;at lea&s;t till matters are in better train; and to allow them to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the cottage they mentioned, ju&s;t at pre|&s;ent, while left to the guidance of their own re&s;entments, would be as bad. Suppo&s;e then"&mdash;here &s;he had a long whi&s;per with her father, at the end of which, &s;he &s;prung up, and running to Henry, a&s;ked him if he was di&s;po&s;ed for a walk to the poor de&s;erted ma|nor-hou&s;e, that fine morning?&mdash;"My father," &s;aid &s;he, "has given me a commi&s;&s;ion, which mu&s;t be executed immediately."</P>
<P>Henry was ri&s;ing to attend her, when
<PB N="56" REF="66">Partington getting up, cried out, "Hold hold, you little villain! I &s;ee you, and your old &s;coundrel of a father, are upon &s;ome &s;cheme to trick me out of my vagabonds:&mdash; but it won't do:&mdash;I have &s;ettled the whole bu&s;ine&s;s. They are getting ready to go with me; and I have ordered your little me&s;&s;age-cart, Armine, to come in tow of <HI>my</HI> chai&s;e; and I had a good mind to have ordered your chai&s;e into the bargain."</P>
<P>"And you might have done &s;o," &s;aid Sir Armine, warmly,&mdash;"and my coach too."&mdash; "And <HI>my</HI> curricle," cried Olivia, putting on her cloak.&mdash;"And <HI>all</HI> our carriages," added Mr. Clare;&mdash;"but then, you mu&s;t not cheat my poor Olivia out of her &s;hare of the Atwoods.&mdash;She tells me, the elde&s;t daughter is to &s;ucceed the fooli&s;h young woman who is marrying off."&mdash;"O!" exclaimed Olivia, "I cannot do without dear Jane;&mdash;&s;he is the only woman in the world to replace Lucy:&mdash; and her child will be no hindrance; and the manor-hou&s;e is really catching cold, for want of company.&mdash;You know, my dear Lady Fitzorton, you never let us live any
<PB N="57" REF="67">where but with you, at the ca&s;tle;&mdash;and we are ten times greater vagabonds, as Mr. Partington calls them, than any of the At|woods. &mdash;So do not interfere with my part of the property, pray, Mr. In&s;ufferable!"</P>
<P>"Be it &s;o:&mdash;you are a &s;ad fellow, though," an&s;wered Partington:&mdash;"but as that is the ca&s;e, my chai&s;e and the cart will do.&mdash;I have &s;ent the caitiff, true George, after Jerom and his Dorothy, as he calls her;&mdash;and I will go before, upon one of your hor&s;es,&mdash; not your mad-cap, Bucephalus, though, Henry; you have taught him &s;ome of your poetical flights.&mdash;Od's pranks! the high-mettled ra&s;cal would throw Apollo;&mdash;one would think he was making Pindarics, while mere mortal man was upon his back! &mdash;No, no, James's even-going pad for me." &mdash;"Order white Surry for the field to-mor|row," quoth Henry, &s;portingly.&mdash;"But whi|ther," demanded Lady Fitzorton,&mdash;"are you going to carry the good folks?"</P>
<P>"To where all vagabonds ought to be car|ried &mdash;to a place of &s;afety:&mdash;&s;o don't a&s;k any
<PB N="58" REF="68">more que&s;tions:&mdash;look to the hu&s;&s;y and her brat, who are to go into your cu&s;tody."</P>
<P>"But &s;hall we not,"&mdash;re&s;umed Lady Fitz|orton &mdash;"&s;ee them again before they go? I have not &s;een any but the elde&s;t daughter and her infant yet."</P>
<P>"No," an&s;wered Partington:&mdash;"no leave-takings. The people are &s;ick and &s;orry;&mdash; and as to gratitude, and all that, time e|nough to &s;ettle the&s;e matters when our work is done. We are officers of <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> you know, and of cour&s;e are re&s;pon&s;ible for our pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>"Meantime, it is ea&s;y to <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> the men and boys have made their bows, and the women and girls dropt their curt&s;ies.

<P><PB N="59" REF="69">"But promi&s;e me,"&mdash;&s;aid Olivia, following Partington to the door;&mdash;"you will leave <HI>my</HI> property; I ought to go and &s;ettle that matter my&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Settle non&s;en&s;e!" cried Partington.&mdash; "I'll tell the girl, &s;he and her child are to be put into pri&s;on, by you in&s;tead of me."</P>
<P>"Oh! but another thing," &s;aid Olivia:&mdash; "I would not have you go to the abbey, nor within &s;ight of it, for the world:&mdash;you know not what may be the con&s;equence.&mdash; Gracious!&mdash;Mr. Partington, you are the be&s;t man in the world&mdash;<HI>almo&s;t</HI>&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;are &s;o precipitate&mdash;&s;o&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Did you ever hear &s;uch a &s;aucy, vex|atious, talkative, prittle-prattle, in&s;olent, in&s;ufferable &s;coundrel, &s;ince you were born?" cried Partington, taking her hand and ki&s;&s;ing it.&mdash;"Why, you little impertinent villain, do you pretend to in&s;truct an old ra&s;cal like me, where I am to go, and what I am to do?&mdash;Do I a&s;k, how you in|tend to di&s;po&s;e of your &s;hare of the ragamuf|fins? &mdash;whether &s;trangling, &s;hooting, or only whipping, is to be their portion?&mdash;As
<PB N="60" REF="70">to the abbey, do you &s;uppo&s;e I will carry &s;uch a &s;et of abominables before the worthy gentleman"&mdash;here he took off his hat, and bowed re&s;pectfully&mdash;"who has been &s;o kind to them, till they are in a proper condition to bring him to the gibbet?&mdash;But you have kept me talking here, while I could have got, with my whole crew, almo&s;t half-way to my journey's end:&mdash;&s;o a&s;k no que&s;tions&mdash; &s;tay, all of you, in this room, without ringing the bell, twenty minutes, by Olivia's watch: &mdash;and &s;o God mend you all."</P>
<P>Saying this, he opened the door, and meeting Henry, he thru&s;t him into the room al&s;o, crying out, "God mend you <HI>too,</HI> you &s;coundrel!"&mdash;then locking the door, gave the key to one of the &s;ervants. "Here, &s;irrah, if you let them out before the expi|ration of twenty minutes by the click of that pendulum oppo&s;ite, to which I now &s;tation you"&mdash;pointing to the ca&s;tle clock&mdash; "I'll anatomize you:&mdash;nay more, I will have an hole dug, chin deep, in the very &s;pot where I now place you,&mdash;and turning you into a &s;un-dial, with a bra&s;s plate nailed to

<P>Partington mounted Steady, after a &s;hort conference with Jerom and his mule, who now came up,&mdash;packed the Atwoods into the carriages&mdash;and George took his &s;tation.</P>

<P>THE Clares and Fitzortons had too &s;incere a veneration for the virtues of this excellent man, not to let him conduct them in his own way.</P>
<P>Sir Armine and Lady Fitzorton could not,
<PB N="62" REF="72">however, but &s;mile at the conceit of their own ca&s;tle being converted into a jail, and one of their own &s;ervants into the jailor;&mdash; and they were puzzling them&s;elves, to know in who&s;e cu&s;tody they were placed, when a voice, which they knew to be that of true George, addre&s;&s;ed them through the key-hole.</P>
<P>"Pray, my ladies and gentlemen, don't be angry;&mdash;I hope you will be plea&s;ed to be &s;hut up for as long a time as Mr. Part|ington has ordered;&mdash;not that I mind being <HI>'natomi&s;ed,</HI> a pin's point;&mdash;but, &s;ays he, you are a &s;coundrel of honour, George,&mdash;this was in a whi&s;per&mdash;&s;haking my hand at the &s;ame time&mdash;your wor&s;hip knows his way.&mdash; So I am &s;orry I can't let you out, my ladies and gentlemen: but I know, if I did, he would never call me a &s;coundrel again,&mdash; though, mayhap, I &s;hould be more of a &s;coundrel then than I am now.&mdash;The time will &s;oon be gone; fourteen minutes and almo&s;t a half now.&mdash;They &s;ay, time has wings: but I think, I never knew him creep &s;o &s;low in my life.&mdash;I wi&s;h I could tell you any pretty &s;tory, or &s;ing a good
<PB N="63" REF="73">&s;ong, or do any thing, to keep your ho|nours in &s;pirits, while you are my pri&s;oners. As for that, had your honours been con|fined in a dark room, you would have been better off than poor me, or Mr. Partington either:&mdash;for there was &s;uch ki&s;&s;ing and cry|ing with the old folks, on leaving Jenny and her child behind,&mdash;and Jenny, I believe is hardly out of her fits yet!"&mdash;"In fits!" an|&s;wered Olivia:&mdash;"let me out this in&s;tant&mdash; no&mdash;run and tell her&mdash;I will be with her in &mdash;a&mdash;very few minutes."&mdash;"I can't go to tell her, mi&s;s, though I had rather be in fits my&s;elf, than &s;he:&mdash;yet I mayn't budge till my time is out."</P>
<P>Among the other good qualities of George, he had one well worthy the adoption of all his party-coloured brethren,&mdash;to wit, that &s;imple but rare property of doing what he was ordered.</P>
<P>"But here &s;he comes with the child in her arms, and the tears all about her pretty face:&mdash;now I can tell her, mi&s;s,&mdash;nay, for that matter, in about another minute and three quarters you may tell her your&s;elf."&mdash;
<PB N="64" REF="74">Here he entered into a &s;hort conver&s;ation with Jane,&mdash;looking alternately at her and at his watch,&mdash;then he exclaimed&mdash;"Huz|za! &mdash;Huzza!&mdash;the time's out! the time's out!"&mdash;and he vaulted in the air as if he him&s;elf had gained his freedom after years of &s;lavery.&mdash;He unlocked the door, entered the room, and entreated their honours' par|don, on receiving which, he went com|forted away.&mdash;Olivia ha&s;ted to her charge&mdash; Henry was about to take his &s;hare in the bu&s;ine&s;s, when his father reque&s;ted him to &s;top a few moments, as he had &s;omething to communicate, to which the pre&s;ence of his mother, and their mutual friend Mr. Clare, could be no objection,&mdash;being, in|deed, parties concerned. "No," added he recollecting him&s;elf,&mdash;"it will do rather better to-morrow morning.&mdash;I forgot a few points which I have to adju&s;t previou&s;ly with <HI>you,</HI> my dear Clare.&mdash;To-morrow morning then, Henry, we will have our conference; the re&s;ult of which, I tru&s;t, will be as per|fect happine&s;s to you, as can be expected in a world like this."</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER X.</HEAD>
<P>THIS little excur&s;ion was productive of an event, which had well nigh brought about that very explanation which Henry had &s;o long de&s;ired, yet dreaded, &s;hould take place.</P>
<P>Olivia had, at this fir&s;t &s;etting out, ar|ranged Jane Atwood between Henry and her&s;elf,&mdash;each in&s;i&s;ting upon taking an arm; but &s;oon after, Olivia made a little alteration by putting her&s;elf in Jenny's place, declar|ing "That &s;he was re&s;olved to have the charge all to her&s;elf." Whether this was the whole, or only in part, the rea&s;on for the change, it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to &s;ay, but it was that which &s;he thought fit to a&s;&s;ign; and there was no time to di&s;pute it; for ju&s;t as the trio had gained an eminence in Mr. Clare's park, Jenny was led by curio&s;ity, or &s;ome other motive, to a&s;k, "Whether the fine &s;eat to the right did not belong to&mdash;to &mdash;to&mdash;"</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="77">Perceiving her faulter, Olivia relieved her by &s;aying "Yes, that is the abbey: but we &s;hall have a better view of it pre&s;ently;&mdash; yet the manor-hou&s;e will be quite jealous if you give the preference, Jane, to the abbey."</P>
<P>Henry &s;uppre&s;&s;ed a &s;igh as he directed his view to the latter.</P>
<P>"And I &s;uppo&s;e, then, that fore&s;t," re&s;umed Jane, with increa&s;ed emotion, "is&mdash;is&mdash;is&mdash; the one I have heard&mdash;&s;o&mdash;&s;o much about?"</P>
<P>"You are right," an&s;wered Olivia: "tho&s;e are the abbey woods;&mdash;but I would have you to know, our dear little groves and &s;hrubberies will &s;upply you with more fra|grant flowers and enchanting walks;&mdash;do not you think &s;o, Henry?"</P>
<P>Jane appearing faint, Olivia propo&s;ed re&s;ting a few minutes in one of the &s;mall alcoves. Hither they repaired:&mdash;Jenny and Henry &s;at on the &s;ame bench,&mdash;perhaps by accident, or out of re&s;pect to Olivia; for they left to her one which commanded an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect, whereas theirs had no|thing to recommend it but an indi&s;tinct view
<PB N="68" REF="78">of the abbey, and a &s;kirt of its fore&s;t.&mdash;Oli|via did not profit by this mark of their po|litene&s;s, rather preferring a &s;eat on the &s;ame bench;&mdash;and, no doubt, by a like chance, or compliment, thinking &s;he had &s;ufficiently a&s;&s;erted her claims, placed her&s;elf by the &s;ide of Henry;&mdash;almo&s;t in the next in&s;tant her attention was drawn to &s;ome pencillings on the oppo&s;ite pannel of the wain&s;cot;&mdash; &s;he ro&s;e to read them.&mdash;Henry, impelled by a &s;udden recollection, caught her gown, and gently drawing her towards him, &s;he again &s;at down, without in the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pect|ing there was any other motive in the mind of Henry than that which, to her own, was the mo&s;t delightful&mdash;the &s;weet thought of Henry;&mdash;and &s;he would have left the alcove, without, perhaps, thinking of her former intention, had not Jane Atwood, as &s;he was going out, exclaimed, "Good Heaven! here are the names of that angel, Mi&s;s Ca|roline, and Lady Stuart! and&mdash;and&mdash;" had Olivia permitted her to &s;tay another moment in the alcove, &s;he would have di&s;|covered the re&s;t: but that amiable girl, be|lieving
<PB N="69" REF="79">&s;he could not get her away too &s;oon, hurried out, prote&s;ting, "They &s;hould not have time to &s;ettle their bu&s;ine&s;s, and be back by dinner."&mdash;She took, however, the fir&s;t opportunity, when they had got into a path which did not admit their all walking together, to a&s;&s;ure Henry &s;he was doubly indebted to him for his con&s;iderate goodne&s;s in preventing her from running on to, per|haps, fatal di&s;coveries:&mdash;"Generous Hen|ry! you feared Jenny, who finds, alas, but too many occa&s;ions to &s;peak of Sir Gui&s;e, would have been led, by &s;eeing the names of his fair daughter, and decea&s;ed wife, into a train of thought, that it is not for her peace &s;he &s;hould indulge.&mdash;But I wonder we have never ob&s;erved the&s;e names before;&mdash;in|deed, it has not been the manor-hou&s;e &s;um|mer this year;&mdash;the ca&s;tle has made us tru|ants from this our other home. I do not think," continued Olivia, availing her&s;elf of being behind Henry, in this narrow path|way, and Jenny's walking before, the gra&s;s on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide being left for mowing,
<PB N="70" REF="80">and almo&s;t ready for the &s;cythe,&mdash;"I do not think any of the family has been in that alcove &s;ince July was twelvemonth, when, you remember, we all dined and pa&s;&s;ed the day there. I do not remember any pencil|ing then; and it is odd enough, how the names of the Stuarts &s;hould be there, as none of them, except Charles, would be likely even to come upon our grounds, &s;ince our unfortunate quarrel, you know.&mdash; Is it not &s;trange Henry? But hu&s;h," &s;aid &s;he,&mdash;"Do not an&s;wer me now: dear Jane will think we neglect her:&mdash;&s;top, let me pa&s;s you, and join her:&mdash;but do not loiter be|hind."</P>
<P>Saying this, &s;he bounded be&s;ide him at a place where the gra&s;s happened to be &s;can|ty; &mdash;and, like Camilla, &s;eemed &s;carcely to bend the blade.&mdash;Thus did Henry e&s;cape a di&s;covery of an imprudence, which the exce&s;s of di&s;appointed love alone could excu&s;e;&mdash; for, had Olivia put her fir&s;t de&s;ign into exe|cution, or Jane continued to go on, the fol|lowing ver&s;es would have been found pen|cilled,
<PB N="71" REF="81">in a &s;maller character, immediately under the names of Caroline, Lady Stuart, Sir Gui&s;e, and Henry.</P>
<Q><L>O potent Love! that thy true &s;ighs,</L>
<L>Could reconcile antipathies!</L>
<L>Ah, then, thy ro&s;y bands &s;hould join</L>

<L>Then too, their long contending &s;ires,</L>

<L>Ah! try then, Love, thy potent &s;ighs,</L>

<P>This effu&s;ion e&s;caped Henry in one of his tender migrations;&mdash;for there was &s;carce a &s;pot on any one of the e&s;tates, which had not received &s;ome memorial of his di&s;ap|pointed pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;and in not a few places his Mu&s;e had been called upon to celebrate the fair object of his afflicted heart&mdash;except in tho&s;e exigencies, when he was really too much di&s;tracted by his pa&s;&s;ion for Caroline, to indulge his pa&s;&s;ion for poetry, or even to know that the fictions of poetry had a place
<PB N="72" REF="82">in his heart;&mdash;&s;o entirely was it at tho&s;e times rapt by the realities of love. Happening to be one day &s;itting in the alcove which we have ju&s;t left, when he was far from happy, yet as far from being hopele&s;s,&mdash;the preci&s;e &s;tate of mind, perhaps, which admits a poetic de&s;cription of real feelings, his thoughts took that turn, in pro&s;e, which he afterwards ver&s;ified in the manner we have &s;een. The warm-breathed prayer, for the mo|ment, &s;oothed the woe: but how he &s;uffered &s;uch a tell-tale evidence, in which "his hand appeared again&s;t his heart," to remain, we know not:&mdash;certain, however, it is, that a future hazard, from the &s;ame cau&s;e, was put at defiance; for the ver&s;es were rubbed out &s;o effectually the &s;ame evening, that not a trace was left for the &s;earching eye either of curio&s;ity or jealou&s;y.</P>

<PB N="74" REF="84">fondne&s;s of infant days, and by veneration, to &s;ee a lady, for who&s;e virtues &s;he bore &s;uch re&s;pect, ran with no le&s;s &s;peed;&mdash;and Hen|ry, agitated by a thou&s;and emotions, rather flew than ran, to behold the cau&s;e of all his bli&s;s and all his angui&s;h. Caroline hav|ing &s;topped her hor&s;e on the fir&s;t hearing of Jenny's ejaculations, recogni&s;ed the per&s;on who had uttered them, but had &s;carcely time to exclaim, "Whom do I behold?&mdash;Is it po&s;&s;ible?&mdash;Can it be Jenny Atwood?"&mdash;be|fore the &s;ight of Henry and Olivia put all her ideas to flight. "Dear a&s;&s;ociate of our blooming hours!" &s;aid Olivia,&mdash;"has chance at la&s;t permitted me again to offer, per&s;on|ally, to your virtues, that tribute, which Henry Fitzorton has a thou&s;and times heard me pay you,&mdash;and which my &s;ecret heart had mingled with my con&s;tant prayers for the choice&s;t ble&s;&s;ings of heaven upon the good?"</P>
<P>Caroline was about to reply, but was &s;o vi&s;ibly affected by the emotions of admiration and a&s;toni&s;hment, excited by the unexpected &s;ight of, perhaps, the three per&s;ons upon
<PB N="75" REF="85">earth mo&s;t calculated to rai&s;e tho&s;e emo|tions,&mdash;and, po&s;&s;ibly, by &s;ome other not un|delightful reflections,&mdash;that &s;he could not utter a word, and with great difficulty kept her &s;eat on the hor&s;e: and when Denni&s;on reminded her, "That Sir Gui&s;e mu&s;t be within a very &s;hort di&s;tance, as he heard the gate &s;hut, which belonged to the cot|tage, where they had left him conver&s;ing with the labourer;&mdash;and as the &s;udden &s;ight of Jane might occa&s;ion &s;ome di&s;turbance," the good old man recommended a &s;epara|tion of the parties for the pre&s;ent.&mdash;"Gra|cious heaven!" exclaimed both the ladies, as if in&s;pired by the &s;ame wi&s;h, and vexed at the &s;ame di&s;appointment,&mdash;"How cruel!"&mdash;"I have ten thou&s;and things to &s;ay," cried Caroline.&mdash;"And I a million!" ob&s;erved Olivia.</P>
<P>"Sir Gui&s;e Stuart coming! did you &s;ay?" que&s;tioned the trembling Jane Atwood.</P>
<P>"O how long my heart has ached for this meeting! But you &s;hall hear all from our dear Henry," &s;aid Olivia to Caro|line.&mdash;"And I hope &s;ome favourable mo|ment
<PB N="76" REF="86">will arrive, when&mdash;but at pre&s;ent this de&s;erving object of your attention might make it, perhaps&mdash;"</P>
<P>"I hear the &s;ound of the hor&s;es' feet," cried Caroline:&mdash;"Barbarous fortune!"&mdash;"Ride on, for goodne&s;s' &s;ake, mi&s;s," exclaim|ed the alternately flu&s;hed and pallid Denni|&s;on, guiding her hor&s;e from the railing again into the road.&mdash;"Jenny Atwood, get out of &s;ight, I charge you:&mdash;my ma&s;ter is ju&s;t behind." Then beckoning Henry to|wards him, the old man whi&s;pered&mdash;"Joy|ful news, dear young &s;quire! joyful news! you'll hear it &s;oon;&mdash;but ma&s;ter mu&s;t not &s;ee Jenny:&mdash;we &s;hall be in a peck of trou|ble again if he does:&mdash;joyful news! joyful news!"</P>
<P>The rapidity with which all the parties conver&s;ed and &s;eparated, and the character|i&s;tic actions and looks of each per&s;on, were &s;uch as to exceed our powers of de&s;crip|tion. Denni&s;on and Caroline were &s;oon out of &s;ight; for when they had pa&s;t the iron rails, the interpo&s;ing trees and thick|ening hedge-rows, &s;hut them from the view.
<PB N="77" REF="87">Henry and Olivia, though &s;carcely able to &s;upport their own emotions, were engaged in carrying, rather than leading, poor Jane Atwood into the hou&s;e;&mdash;where they were no &s;ooner arrived, than the haple&s;s victim of love and con&s;cience almo&s;t fell on her knees; burning, at the &s;ame in&s;tant, with her blu&s;hes, as &s;he implored permi&s;&s;ion to be taken where &s;he might ju&s;t have a glance, one glance, at Sir Gui&s;e, without being her&s;elf &s;een;&mdash;promi&s;ing, that it &s;hould be the la&s;t reque&s;t &s;he would ever dare to make concerning him:&mdash;"and, oh! pray, pray con&s;ider, whatever be his faults he is the father of&mdash;." Then &s;eeing Olivia give a half a&s;&s;enting, half denying look, betwixt compa&s;&s;ion and reluctance, as &s;he rai&s;ed her up,&mdash;the haple&s;s girl followed to a chamber in the &s;econd &s;tory, without &s;eeming to want any of the &s;trength or life which had before left her;&mdash;and, running to the win|dow that looked into the road, &s;he cla&s;ped her hands together, crying, "There&mdash;there&mdash;there is&mdash;there is&mdash;the father, alas! of my poor&mdash;poor&mdash;di&s;honoured&mdash;" and,
<PB N="78" REF="88">without fini&s;hing the &s;entence, fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s upon the floor, lo&s;t to the view of what &s;he had &s;o earne&s;tly &s;upplicated.</P>
<P>It was not ea&s;y to recover her: for when &s;he had any return of life and rea&s;on, her quick &s;en&s;ibility of &s;hame for the confu&s;ion &s;he had cau&s;ed, and the weakne&s;s &s;he had betrayed, produced &s;uch terrifying relap&s;es, that, had not True George been di&s;patched to the manor-hou&s;e, to &s;ay dinner waited, and gone back with his u&s;ual &s;peed, &s;eeing the po&s;ture of affairs, and a&s;king no que&s;|tions, but taking it for granted the coach, with which he &s;oon returned, would be ne|ce&s;&s;ary,&mdash;it is not probable they would have regained the ca&s;tle that day.</P>
<P>When Olivia and Henry had lei&s;ure to &s;e|parate the reflections which the foregoing &s;cenes had crowded upon them, a new light was thrown over many old &s;ubjects.&mdash;Fir&s;t, it appeared very clear to them both, as it afterwards did to the whole family, that &s;uch was the dominion Sir Gui&s;e Stuart had &s;till over the affections of Jane Atwood, it would be highly improper, and indeed im|po&s;&s;ible,
<PB N="79" REF="89">to place her at the manor-hou&s;e, or any where el&s;e in the neighbourhood of the abbey. Secondly, Olivia was &s;truck with the increa&s;ed per&s;onal beauty and graceful manners of Caroline, &s;et off as they were by an ineffable kind of &s;mile, which &s;eemed to open upon the per&s;on addre&s;&s;ed the warme&s;t and mo&s;t brilliant rays of her heart and under&s;tanding;&mdash;indeed, &s;he &s;aw Caro|line al&s;o, under the influence of unu&s;ually happy feelings, proceeding from the joyful news that Denni&s;on hinted at; &s;he there|fore, gently reproached Henry for not hav|ing done her ju&s;tice;&mdash;&s;he doubted whether, even his candid mind had not &s;uffered the in&s;ults received from the father, in &s;ome &s;mall degree, to create a prejudice again&s;t the daughter;&mdash;but this idea was done away on her recon&s;idering the matter, "for," &s;aid &s;he, with the mo&s;t un&s;u&s;picious &s;impli|city, "if this were the ca&s;e, it would have operated equally, and perhaps more &s;o, to the di&s;advantage of the &s;on."&mdash;She then tried to account for the matter in many other ways; and it ended in her rea&s;oning, as
<PB N="80" REF="90">u&s;ual, to her Henry's credit: &s;he told her own heart&mdash;and the intelligence commu|nicated to her cheeks a &s;uffu&s;ion of that beautiful bloom, which is produced by con&s;cious plea&s;ure,&mdash;&s;he told her own heart, that the tender partiality which Henry en|tertained for her&s;elf, made him blind to much greater perfections in every other woman.&mdash;This &s;ettled the point to that heart's content; and he was again honourably acquitted, as to prejudice, but found guilty, &s;weetly guilty of inju&s;tice;&mdash;yet love pardoned him even that offence; "For in truth," &s;aid &s;he, "inju&s;tice to Caroline is love to Olivia."&mdash;It is at any rate, very certain, that, among&s;t all her ways of inve&s;tigating this want of rhap&s;ody in Henry, on a &s;ubject whereon &s;he thought its whole &s;cope would have been warranted,&mdash;&s;he never once hit upon the only cau&s;e to which it might have been at|tributed, and to which a thou&s;and other young ladies would, mo&s;t likely, have a&s;|&s;igned it.&mdash;Reader, whatever be thy &s;ex, in the degree that thou art armed with know|ledge of the world,&mdash;or art arrayed only in
<PB N="81" REF="91">that natural innocence, which has no &s;u&s;pi|cions or concealments, and which may long be the amiable victim of its credulity, with|out at all &s;uppo&s;ing it is &s;o,&mdash;thou wilt pro|nounce upon this part of Olivia's conduct and character. If thou ha&s;t the world's wi&s;dom about thee, thou wilt condemn her as a &s;illy girl, wanting penetration, where the mo&s;t &s;tupid are &s;aid to be &s;harp &s;ighted;&mdash;but, if thou art endowed with that un&s;u&s;pecting quality we have mentioned, proceeding from unpracti&s;ed innocence, thou wilt love her for po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing that, which, wert thou united to congenial virtue, would make thy home a paradi&s;e, and thy partner &s;uch as the old poet has de&s;cribed, where he ob|&s;erves, thou mighte&s;t
<Q>Lay thy &s;leeping life within her arms</Q>
But, whether thou believe&s;t &s;uch excellence for natural or not, we can only re-a&s;&s;ure thee, &s;uch was the excellence of Olivia Clare;&mdash;and if thou art a man, the wor&s;t we wi&s;h thee is, that thou maye&s;t be con|vinced

<P>IN the progre&s;s of the evening after the&s;e occurrences, Jenny, by the tender a&s;&s;iduities of Olivia, became much more compo&s;ed, though at the fir&s;t &s;ight of her own little one, &s;he bur&s;t into a flood of tears, amid&s;t which &s;he told the infant, &s;he had encountered her name-&s;ake &mdash; &s;he tried to impart to it a &s;hare of her own emotions,&mdash;and concluded by a&s;king the poor babe,&mdash;as if it were of an age to feel and rea&s;on on its misfortune, "Whether it would be po&s;&s;ible for Sir Gui&s;e to look upon that innocent face, without ki&s;&s;ing, loving, and affording it &s;ome pro|tection?"</P>
<P>But the greate&s;t difficulty for the hi&s;torian of the&s;e pages, is to enter into, or explain the re&s;ult of Henry's &s;entiments and feelings on the various incidents of this eventful day, every hour of which, as indeed of &s;e|veral preceding ones, had gradually wrought
<PB N="83" REF="93">him to a ten&s;ion of thought and &s;en&s;ation, almo&s;t too oppre&s;&s;ive and tumultuous for his rea&s;on to &s;u&s;tain.&mdash;Every time he beheld Olivia, he witne&s;&s;ed not only her particular attachment to him&s;elf, but the general ex|cellence of her character.&mdash;He &s;aw all that is mo&s;t graceful, and mo&s;t worthy, uniting in her di&s;po&s;ition:&mdash;he perceived that &s;he was &s;o guarded by the ingenuou&s;ne&s;s of her own heart,&mdash;it would have required none of the refined arts of a hypocrite to deceive her, in whatever mo&s;t concerned her peace, even for her whole life together:&mdash;he ob&s;erved, that her faith was &s;o entire in him, that, as he never did, and indeed never had oppor|tunity to intimate her affection was not re|turned,&mdash;it is doubtful whether any thing but the &s;tronge&s;t confirmation of po&s;itive proofs could have per&s;uaded her to be|lieve it. For his deepe&s;t my&s;teries, &s;he had an explanation &s;upplied by her love, and &s;atisfactory to her rea&s;on;&mdash;and, for his very languors,&mdash;(we will not u&s;e &s;o chilling a word as coldne&s;s,&mdash;it was, perhaps, not po&s;&s;ible to his nature)&mdash;for his languors, her
<PB N="84" REF="94">own delicacy &s;ugge&s;ted an apology, or ra|ther a vindication. Her warm encomiums on his Caroline evinced the &s;uperiority of her &s;oul to that petty jealou&s;y, which too often takes alarm at the charms of another woman;&mdash;and her behaviour to the poor Atwoods, more e&s;pecially to the di&s;honour|ed Jane, notwith&s;tanding her tre&s;pa&s;s in a point which few females can pardon in each other under any circum&s;tances, no, not even where their con&s;cience tells them, for the mo&s;t <HI>&s;elfi&s;h</HI> rea&s;ons, they ought to have a degree of fellow feeling,&mdash;was a fre&s;h in|&s;tance, among&s;t innumerable others, of her liberal and forgiving &s;pirit;&mdash;placing her con&s;picuou&s;ly on the li&s;t of the truly good, though not on the catalogue of tho&s;e whom Mr. Addi&s;on has emphatically called the "outrageou&s;ly virtuous."</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations, re-inforced by tho&s;e which, as auxiliaries, he placed before his eyes,&mdash;the family arguments in her favour, &s;uch as a &s;imilarity of religion,&mdash;the ardent hopes of both their parents,&mdash;the reward which &s;o much con&s;tancy, &s;uch unwearied
<PB N="85" REF="95">tenderne&s;s and goodne&s;s claimed from him;&mdash;with the &s;ad rever&s;e in ca&s;e of his remaining in&s;en&s;ible, or undecided,&mdash;&s;uch as a reli|gious di&s;pute, the mo&s;t of all human con|tentions to be dreaded, whether in families or in &s;tates,&mdash;the mi&s;ery, perhaps the death, of Olivia's father, and of his own parents,&mdash;the de&s;pair, perhaps the di&s;traction, of Oli|via her&s;elf, &s;hould &s;he di&s;cover not only that &s;he had not been the object beloved, but that he had all along loved another;&mdash;the&s;e reflections, we &s;ay, with the impre&s;&s;ions left on his mind by the keen ob&s;ervations and cautionary hints of his brother John, had, at intervals, &s;ince he returned from the funeral of Lady Stuart, almo&s;t reconciled him to the idea of &s;urrendering up his love, as a &s;a|crifice to his friend&s;hip, gratitude, and fi|lial duty:&mdash;and how powerfully the&s;e three advocates can plead their cau&s;e in a heart like that of Henry Fitzorton, tho&s;e who are acquainted with their eloquence, alone can tell.</P>
<P>At times, he even plea&s;ed him&s;elf with the proud triumph he &s;uppo&s;ed he &s;hould
<PB N="86" REF="96">feel on &s;uch a &s;acrifice, and thought, for a moment, the felicity of many ought to out|weigh, in a generous mind, all con&s;idera|tions for the happine&s;s of one.&mdash;To encou|rage him in the&s;e &s;entiments, he now paid more than his wonted attention to the words and actions of Olivia,&mdash;expatiated on her various attractions, per&s;onal and mental,&mdash;talked to others, and to him&s;elf about her, and ab&s;olutely &s;et him&s;elf &s;eriou&s;ly down to the ta&s;k of trying to ripen his affectionate friend&s;hip for her into love,&mdash;at lea&s;t &s;uch a degree of it, as would guard her from his own wandering feelings, &s;hould they join their hands:&mdash;the natural effect of all which was, that although he did not make Olivia more in love with him, becau&s;e that was impo&s;&s;ible, he riveted the affection &s;he &s;incerely felt for him, in a manner that death alone, and that her <HI>own</HI> death, could break the chain; for &s;he had been heard to declare, (and truth guarded, while it graced her lips) that Henry's de&s;cending fir&s;t to the grave could not impair her attachment, "&s;ince I am convinced," &s;aid &s;he, weeping at there
<PB N="87" REF="97">being a human po&s;&s;ibility that he might die fir&s;t,&mdash;"the memory of him would be infi|nitely more dear to me than the life of any other man, be his profe&s;&s;ions or preten&s;ions what they might." But, alas! the very at|tentions which we have ob&s;erved Henry had impo&s;ed him&s;elf, were impo&s;ed as a <HI>ta&s;k,</HI> and&mdash;like other forced formalities, and coercive le&s;&s;ons, which <HI>mu&s;t be learned,</HI>&mdash;turned the whole into a reluctant, but nece&s;&s;ary toil;&mdash;
<Q>Hic labor hoc opus e&s;t,</Q> was its motto, which, in the end, made him recede from the point he thereby propo&s;ed to gain, in the very proportion that Olivia, who&s;e tenderne&s;s was prepared to receive every the lea&s;t impre&s;&s;ion, and expre&s;&s;ion of his,&mdash;and who&s;e own tenderne&s;s was her heart's &s;pontaneous joy,&mdash;advanced towards it.</P>
<P>And, indeed, tho&s;e efforts in favour of Olivia were always made by Henry after &s;everal days' ab&s;ence from Caroline: but the bare mention of the name of the latter, the &s;ight of her miniature, which the reader cer|tainly
<PB N="88" REF="98">recollects he was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, and to which, "though it be not here written down," we tru&s;t the &s;aid reader has repre&s;ented the too faithful lover, as frequently paying his &s;ecret devotion,&mdash;or even the mo&s;t trivial circum&s;tance that had allu&s;ion to Caroline, would, in a &s;ingle moment, level with the du&s;t the laboured fortification he had built in his fancy, for the reception and defence of Olivia.&mdash;And, when he &s;uppo&s;ed his par|tiality to that la&s;t-mentioned amiable girl was greater than it u&s;ed to be, after he had heard her launch forth into eulogies on the per&s;on, manners, voice, or recorded deeds of Caroline, it was then mo&s;t demon&s;trable, that his e&s;teem was the greater for the one, becau&s;e &s;he had then done mo&s;t ju&s;tice to the other:&mdash;in fact, becau&s;e Olivia, his <HI>friend,</HI> had offered homage to Caroline, his <HI>love:</HI>&mdash;and thus did the former become the victim of her own un&s;u&s;picious genero&s;ity.</P>

<P>AFTER this explanation, it will not be matter of &s;urpri&s;e to the reader, that, though Henry neither &s;poke, nor was &s;poken to, in the momentary interview he had with Caroline at the manor-hou&s;e,&mdash;the &s;ight of her, and perhaps another look, of which <HI>he</HI> only knew the &s;en&s;e and &s;entiment,&mdash;for lovers alone can tran&s;late, with accuracy, the &s;ilent language of love,&mdash;the mo&s;t recent cordial poured into his heart by hone&s;t Den|ni&s;on, in tho&s;e brief but potent &s;ounds of "Joyful news at home, young &s;quire!"&mdash;the&s;e were more than enough to make him forget the little he had learnt from contem|plating the virtues of his fair inmate;&mdash;and convinced him, that his heart was neither a convert to Olivia, nor an apo&s;tate to Ca|roline.</P>
<P>While yet in this di&s;po&s;ition, the hour ap|pointed for his interview with his father ap|proached,
<PB N="90" REF="100">and he determined it &s;hould al&s;o be the hour of his long &s;mothered confidence:&mdash;but, what was his &s;urpri&s;e, what his di&s;ap|pointment, when, betwixt the time of True George's coming into his apartment, to an|nounce his father's being prepared to re|ceive him in his chamber, and his a&s;cending the &s;tairs, to obey that &s;ummons, his mother ha&s;tened, in much di&s;order, to &s;ay, the inter|view mu&s;t be po&s;tponed! as a &s;udden return of his poor father's complaint made it im|po&s;&s;ible to &s;peak on any &s;ubject in which his feelings were intere&s;ted; but that, if he found him&s;elf not &s;ufficiently recovered in a day or two, he would depute <HI>her</HI> to commu|nicate his &s;entiments, "which, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, my dear Henry," added &s;he, "are of a nature not to brook delay;&mdash;and I am not without my fears, that &s;omething he has ju&s;t heard re&s;pecting you, Henry, has been the chief means of bringing on a fit of the illne&s;s, to which you know he is unfortu|nately &s;ubject."</P>
<P>The trembling Henry, after expre&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t &s;incere &s;orrow for his father's &s;ud|den
<PB N="91" REF="101">attack, earne&s;tly entreated to know how he had been the unhappy cau&s;e?</P>
<P>"I have received your father's &s;trong in|junctions," replied Lady Fitzorton, "not to breathe the &s;ubject either to you or to any of the family till farther notice, and mu&s;t now return to his chamber: for, alas! Sir Armine is all this time in extreme pain." Turning round, however, as &s;he was going out at the door, and looking &s;teadfa&s;tly,&mdash;"Henry," &s;aid &s;he, "if the intelligence which has reached us be true, your own con|&s;cience will point it out: and if happily it be fal&s;e, the &s;ame bo&s;om in&s;tructor will acquit you, and leave on your mind no other regret, than that your father <HI>mu&s;t</HI> &s;uffer from the mi&s;conception, till it can be done away.&mdash;In either ca&s;e," added his mother, "the report, we tru&s;t in God, has reached only to your father and my&s;elf:&mdash;heaven forbid that it &s;hould have extended farther!"</P>
<P>Henry's bo&s;om in&s;tructor told all, and more than all, perhaps, of the tale to which his mother alluded;&mdash;it did not he&s;itate a moment to &s;ugge&s;t to him, that the fatal
<PB N="92" REF="102">&s;ecret of his heart was beginning to circu|late. He &s;till &s;u&s;pected it had come to the ears of John; and he did not at all doubt but it was now rapidly making its progre&s;s through the ca&s;tle.&mdash;The fir&s;t wi&s;h of his &s;oul, we have &s;een, was that this <HI>might</HI> be the ca&s;e: but all the feelings of gratitude, of delicacy, of duty, and, as it will &s;peedily appear, of intere&s;t,&mdash;made him de&s;ire the di&s;covery &s;hould be attended by tho&s;e <HI>pre|paratory explanations,</HI> which, if they could not exculpate, might qualify his conduct.</P>
<P>Indeed he began now to &s;u&s;pect that the &s;ecret was already more &s;pread than he had before &s;uppo&s;ed, though it was plain, from Olivia's whole demeanour, that it had not yet been communicated to her.</P>
<P>And this, reader, &s;eems to be the place at which we mu&s;t &s;peak to thee again, though not perhaps for the la&s;t time, in the charac|ter of recorder of the&s;e annals.&mdash;We are not to learn, that a printed book is a very pe|rilous, and in &s;ome &s;ort an a&s;&s;uming under|taking, and that the wit and wi&s;dom of a reader are upon guard and in arms, like

<P>Some of the&s;e errors are of cour&s;e obvi|ous: and it is extremely probable that thy acumen has enabled thee to detect many, many more, not generally apparent: and in good time thy fault-finding powers may a&s;&s;i&s;t thee in di&s;covering others: but, as we would not perver&s;ely, maliciou&s;ly, or wit|tingly, leave any of the &s;tumbling blocks in thy way, we will at all times do our be&s;t to remove them, as well for thy ea&s;e as our own: for it is as &s;orry a thing in books as in life,&mdash;and we hold it alike villanous,&mdash;to put people, whether writing or talking to them, out of temper, when it is in any po&s;|&s;ible way to be prevented.</P>
<P>Now it may happen, that, before thou ha&s;t gained this &s;tage of our hi&s;tory, we have put thee a little out of humour by a &s;eeming violation of probability: it may have offended thy critical talents, that we &s;hould have, as it may &s;eem to thee, mali|ciou&s;ly

<P>No wonder, therefore, that Olivia and her father were, in the ca&s;tle, the la&s;t and the only per&s;ons who heard the &s;ecret that &s;o nearly related to them&s;elves:&mdash;for al|though love-tales, being among&s;t the mo&s;t light, are the mo&s;t ea&s;y of carriage&mdash;yet it may very po&s;&s;ibly happen, that even the &s;trong temptation which naturally ari&s;es out of a &s;trict inhibition to do the very thing forbidden, may, in &s;ome minds, be contra&s;t|ed by a yet &s;tronger de&s;ire to re&s;i&s;t.&mdash;And this was the exact ca&s;e at pre&s;ent:&mdash;that &s;tronger de&s;ire was the &s;incere love which was entertained for Olivia by every part of the family: even the go&s;&s;iping part of it in the &s;ervants' hall would &s;acrifice the delight of doing what was commanded not to be done, to the &s;uperior plea&s;ure of &s;aying and doing every thing that could keep <HI>her</HI> from the knowledge of whatever might give her pain. And, as to Sir Armine and his lady, there
<PB N="97" REF="107">were other obvious rea&s;ons why the intelli|gence that might reach them would be with-held from Mr. Clare and his daughter.</P>
<P>Now, in regard to Caroline Stuart, though the &s;ame motives would operate the &s;ame way towards concealing from her the &s;ecret of Olivia and Henry,&mdash;for Olivia could not be more the object of dome&s;tic good will a|mong&s;t the &s;ervants,&mdash;it was, in her ca&s;e, le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to act upon tho&s;e motives: for Sir Gui&s;e &s;carcely ever had a gue&s;t at home &s;ince his di&s;grace, but Henry and father Arthur; and there was not the &s;malle&s;t intercour&s;e between the kitchens of the two hou&s;es, from whence mo&s;t of the materials for &s;e|cret hi&s;tory are collected;&mdash;and &s;he really had no opportunity of knowing, nor did &s;he hear any thing that related to the Fitz|ortons, &s;ince the &s;eparating quarrel, &s;ave what Henry and her brother Charles cho&s;e to communicate:&mdash;and whether tho&s;e un|happy friends were likely to tell Caroline, as matters now &s;tood, the reader may by this time well judge.</P>
<P>Henry Fitzorton's ill-fated pa&s;&s;ion, there|fore,
<PB N="98" REF="108">yet remained to be told to tho&s;e at the ca&s;tle, who were the mo&s;t deeply intere&s;ted in its effects.&mdash;Yet in the proportion that he imagined it known to others, he panted for its being communicated even where he mo&s;t trembled to confide it: and in the per|plexity which his long &s;uppre&s;&s;ion produced, he began to wi&s;h that it were unravelled by any means, rather than it &s;hould not be unravelled,&mdash;and the more e&s;pecially &s;ince the my&s;tery of his love was not the only one that oppre&s;&s;ed his heart.&mdash;Sometimes he determined to write, &s;ometimes to &s;peak the whole &s;tory to Olivia, and throw him&s;elf on her genero&s;ity. Sometimes he had thoughts of making her father fir&s;t ac|quainted with the hi&s;tory, "whereof by par|cels he has <HI>&s;omewhat</HI> heard perhaps," &s;ays he, "but nought di&s;tinctly."&mdash;This was, how|ever, rejected; and all his hopes were again anchored on Olivia, whom he fully re&s;olved to inform of every thing,&mdash;and that the very fir&s;t opportunity.</P>
<P>On the heel of this determination, Olivia her&s;elf, who had been giving her a&s;&s;i&s;tance
<PB N="99" REF="109">to Henry's mother, to mitigate the &s;harp agonies which his father had been endur|ing, came running into the room, and pre|&s;ented a letter to Henry,&mdash;&s;aying, as &s;he delivered it,&mdash;"I hope it will prove a cor|dial to your &s;pirts, which I know your fa|ther's &s;ickne&s;s mu&s;t depre&s;s;&mdash;it comes from the abbey,&mdash;and who knows but our good &s;tars may be working together &s;o far for our good, that Sir Gui&s;e may permit his angel of a daughter to be upon the &s;ame terms at the ca&s;tle, as are enjoyed by his &s;on Charles?&mdash;For know, my Henry, I am a great dreamer, and I have had a &s;ort of vi&s;ion about this:&mdash;I &s;ee, 'tis a lady's hand.&mdash;I would lay any thing, we &s;hall find that our Caroline is the writer;&mdash;but even if it &s;hould be &s;o, and my dream <HI>&s;hould</HI> come true, we mu&s;t keep it to our&s;elves, and not &s;ay a word of it to any of the family,&mdash;becau&s;e it will be &s;o delight&s;ul &s;o have the &s;ecret be|tween us, and divulge it ju&s;t at the time we have brought about a reconciliation.&mdash;Ah! Henry, if you and I &s;hould, after all, be the means of &s;uch a happine&s;s, how com|fortable
<PB N="100" REF="110">will it be to all parties!&mdash;for it is &s;uch a &s;hocking thing for neighbours to bear malice for &s;o long a time!&mdash;and though, perhaps, we can do little good with Sir Gui&s;e, we might put up with a great deal from him, to be in friend&s;hip with Mi&s;s Stu|art.&mdash;Do, then, read the letter, and tell me what it &s;ays,&mdash;that is, if it goes at all to my la&s;t night's dream."</P>
<P>Henry, who know at the fir&s;t glance, that the letter was directed at lea&s;t by Caroline, had been trying by every means in his power to conceal his agitation,&mdash;when a &s;er|vant came to de&s;ire Olivia's immediate at|tendance upon Lady Fitzorton. She had &s;carcely left the room when the trembling and impatient Henry opened the billet, which contained the&s;e words: "Scarcely can I hold my pen,&mdash;&s;uch is the &s;atisfaction of my heart, to inform you I write by the command of my father, to in|vite you to the abbey, where we may enter into the particulars of the extraordinary, but endearing and renovating encounter of ye&s;terday morning,&mdash;an encounter which
<PB N="101" REF="111">pre&s;ented to my view three per&s;ons I had long mo&s;t anxiou&s;ly de&s;ired again to behold,&mdash;Jane Atwood, my lovely playmate Olivia, and Henry Fitzorton.&mdash;Do not write any thing in reply to this ha&s;ty billet, part of which is confidential,&mdash;but <HI>come your&s;elf</HI> to|morrow noon, the time appointed by my father to receive you. You will imagine how I rejoice in a reconciliation betwixt my father, and my brother's deare&s;t friend.&mdash;Ah, Henry! gue&s;s the emotions of Caroline Stuart."</P>
<P>He had ju&s;t fini&s;hed the peru&s;al, when True George came ha&s;tily into the apartment, pre&s;enting another letter,&mdash;"Ju&s;t brought by the po&s;t, your honour: and I came with it as quick as I could, becau&s;e I believe 'tis from 'Squire Stuart the lieutenant, and I thought it might bring your honour good news."</P>
<P>Hone&s;t George was partly right in his conjecture;&mdash;it brought tidings at once of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and painful nature.&mdash;Charles acquainted his friend,&mdash;"that he would li&s;ten to no terms of accommodation with his father, unle&s;s the re&s;toration of

I owe to <HI>you</HI> far more than I can ever pay, till my &s;i&s;ter is your own!&mdash;but pardon the vanity of my affection, if I con&s;ider her hand as a recom|pence in full, even for all your pain, for all your goodne&s;s,&mdash;even for the la&s;t&mdash;the <HI>com|mi&s;&s;ion:</HI>&mdash;and yet that <HI>di&s;intere&s;ted</HI> office is &s;o&mdash;but I accept it&mdash;from <HI>you,</HI>&mdash;yes I accept it

It can ne|ver be,&mdash;tho&s;e wounds <HI>mu&s;t</HI> flow, though the life-blood of Charles mingles in the &s;tream. Had the heart of my friend been captive to my Olivia,&mdash;pardon me for the weakne&s;s of calling her what &s;he will never be!&mdash;I think my own would have been guarded from captivity;&mdash;or reflections on the prior
<PB N="104" REF="114">claims of my deare&s;t Henry would have made me look upon his <HI>choice</HI> with the eyes I look upon my &s;i&s;ter, or, as you your&s;elf, Henry, look upon Olivia:&mdash;or if a tender idea had at any time obtruded, I would then have expelled it as a traitor, encroaching on the rights of &s;acred friend&s;hip and mu|tual love.&mdash;But, as I know your heart is another's,&mdash;as I know the love is not recipro|cal, and as I feel &s;he is dearer to me, than the breath I now draw in deep and bitter &s;ighs,&mdash;Oh! how peace would return to us all, Henry, did Olivia experience that &s;enti|ment for me, that &s;he cheri&s;hes &s;o fondly, &s;o fatally, for my friend!</P>
<P>"But why do I talk of peace?&mdash;alas! I have never known what it is &s;ince la&s;t we parted.&mdash;The lo&s;s of my mother, and the little pro&s;pect of my ever being happy with the adored Olivia, preys upon my health, and bears down my &s;pirits.&mdash;On the&s;e &s;ub|jects, ever dear and ever fatal to my re|membrance, I dare not dwell:&mdash;but the only &s;olace in this long ab&s;ence, which I have been capable of receiving, has ari&s;en from

<PB N="106" REF="116">Accur&s;ed fortune!&mdash;yet, by heaven, I would rather unite my&s;elf to a fiend who loves me, than to a &s;eraph who could not give me the heart. They talk of a war, Henry! would it were come!&mdash;&s;elfi&s;h, cruel, murde|rous, as is the wi&s;h to thou&s;ands of the human race,&mdash;I cannot but exclaim, would it were come!&mdash;My fatal pa&s;&s;ion &s;eems to gain &s;uch &s;trength, as to render me weak to every other tie,&mdash;even to that which holds me to my &s;pecies. It is not without diffi|culty, I conceal my &s;ufferings from the ex|cellent colonel:&mdash;"You droop, Stuart," &s;aid he to me this morning, taking me by the hand, but with a &s;mile of encouragement: "you droop, my lad.&mdash;I am no talker, Charles: but do you want any thing within my com|pa&s;s? &mdash;I do not de&s;ire to clog you with obli|gation: I &s;hall therefore only a&s;k, would you borrow?&mdash;I have heard your father is not &s;o liberal as his &s;on is de&s;erving.&mdash;Or is there an enemy here" (laying his hand on my heart) "got into the brea&s;t-work, and in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of this little fort?&mdash;Is there mutiny within?&mdash;I do not, however, a&s;k for love

I &s;hall bid adieu to him, and to many of my valuable brother officers, with infinite regret;&mdash;and, be a&s;&s;ured, among&s;t all my cares, I am not in&s;en&s;ible, that your generous heart, a&s;&s;i&s;ted, I cannot but think, by your good father's heart, &s;hould have fixed me in the regiment of John Fitzorton.&mdash;Why, Henry, have you interdicted the &s;ub|ject?
<PB N="108" REF="118">&mdash;but alas! military and every other ambition, but that which cannot be gratified, is, I fear, dying in my bo&s;om:&mdash;an unfortu|nate pa&s;&s;ion alone lives there:&mdash;it will con|&s;ume me, Henry: I &s;hall grow in&s;en&s;ible to every thing el&s;e;&mdash;no, &s;urely, the affection I have for my Henry Fitzorton will &s;urvive the general wreck, and holy friend&s;hip be pre&s;erved entire, amid&s;t the ruins of Charles Stuart."</P>
<P>So various were the emotions which the peru&s;al of Caroline's billet and this letter occa&s;ioned, that Henry could &s;carcely read to the end. Love, friend&s;hip, pity, hope, fear, admiration, joy, and &s;orrow, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him by turns; and at the conclu&s;ion, they all &s;eemed to be at war in his bo&s;om. His friend Charles, his brother, his parents, Olivia, and Caroline, tyrannized at once.&mdash;The empire was long divided, long con|tended for:&mdash;but love, as is generally the ca&s;e in &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions, a&s;&s;erted its domi|nion, looked upon all other pa&s;&s;ions as u&s;urpers, and re-a&s;&s;umed its &s;overeignty on the throne of his affections.&mdash;Caroline Stu|art,
<PB N="109" REF="119">appeared to be fixed there too &s;tedfa&s;tly for any u&s;urpation to prevail.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="15" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XV.</HEAD>
<P>IT was in this cri&s;is that Olivia re-en|tered the apartment, eager to know the contents of Caroline's billet, and to convey to Henry the intelligence of his father's being much better;&mdash;&s;he never omitted any communication, which &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed might obviate pain or promote plea&s;ure.&mdash;"Well!" &s;aid &s;he, with vivacity,&mdash;" is my dream out?&mdash;does Mi&s;s Stuart mention any thing of our ye&s;terday's adventure?&mdash;does &s;he ho|nour her playmate with her remembrance?&mdash;does &s;he notice Jenny Atwood?&mdash;and is there any chance, provided our little plans &s;ucceed with all our fathers, of Olivia and Caroline ever becoming friends, in|ve&s;ted with the privileges of Charles and Henry?"</P>
<P>What a cruel &s;tring of que&s;tions,&mdash;each kindly conceived, and &s;weetly delivered!&mdash;Henry was, however, collected enough to
<PB N="110" REF="120">&s;tisfy her, who attributed all the emotions of his ardent love to &s;entiments of glowing friend&s;hip;&mdash;and &s;he entered into the recon|ciliation of the families in general, and the long-de&s;ired intercour&s;e of Caroline and Oli|via, in particular,&mdash;only in a le&s;s degree, and on a much more di&s;intere&s;ted principle than him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Stuart," &s;aid Henry,&mdash;"is &s;o ear|ne&s;t to hear more of Jane, and to pour forth the tribute of prai&s;e to Olivia, that &s;he has even per&s;uaded Sir Gui&s;e to give me an in|vitation to the abbey, where I have not been, you know, &s;ince the funeral of lady Stuart;&mdash;and Caroline has written in the mo&s;t impatient terms, to acquaint me with her father's acquie&s;cence."</P>
<P>Here Henry pretended to rummage his pockets for the billet it&s;elf, and expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e what could po&s;&s;ibly have be|come of it,&mdash;though we are afraid there was very little rea&s;on for &s;urpri&s;e,&mdash;the &s;aid billet being, probably, not only in his pock|et, but often in his hand, during the affected &s;earch;&mdash;and, no doubt, he could have pro|duced
<PB N="111" REF="121">it with nearly the &s;ame degree of dif|ficulty, as the taking the hand which held it, out of the afore&s;aid pocket.</P>
<P>But Henry <HI>&s;imulated,</HI> you &s;ee, reader;&mdash;this letter having again thrown out the ex|planatory bill, he predetermined to with|hold the billet, and was, accordingly, in|&s;pired with a due degree of wonder, what could have become of it.</P>
<P>"Never &s;tand looking for the letter," ob|&s;erved Olivia, who appeared always fated to help him out of his embarra&s;&s;ments, uncon|&s;cious that &s;he was thereby plunging deeper into her own:&mdash;"never &s;tand looking for the letter!&mdash;For heaven's &s;ake! go to the abbey directly:&mdash;I have heard you &s;ay, Sir Gui&s;e is a pa&s;&s;ionate, capricious creature, and has his &s;tarts of rage and reconciliation; and who knows how &s;oon he may change his mind again?&mdash;then we &s;hall all be at a lo&s;s for &s;uch another opportunity.&mdash;Be&s;ide, your good father is better, and you can go with perfect ea&s;e;&mdash;I need only &s;ay to him, you are taking your beloved wood walk,&mdash;(you can go to the fore&s;t, you know)&mdash;and
<PB N="112" REF="122">that you were quite in &s;pirits at the thought of his mending &s;o fa&s;t.&mdash;I am &s;ure every word of all this will be true."</P>
<P>Henry now ob&s;erved, "That an epi&s;tle was ju&s;t come, al&s;o, from Charles,"&mdash;and without any of that &s;urpri&s;e or difficulty at|tending the production of Caroline's billet, he drew it from his pocket.&mdash;"See," &s;aid he,&mdash;"Olivia, what a pacquet!"</P>
<P>There were one or two pa&s;&s;ages which he could wi&s;h to have read to her, as de&s;crip|tive of his friend's pa&s;&s;ion for her&s;elf,&mdash;hop|ing, the knowledge of it might lead the way to &s;omething favourable;&mdash;for, al|though his own pa&s;&s;ion, &s;o far as it de|pended on Caroline, was now in a better train than it had been for a con&s;iderable time,&mdash;he felt the &s;ituation of his faithful Charles, as one of the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive of the many heavy drawbacks upon his newly|revived hopes.</P>
<P>Unfolding, therefore, the pacquet, to &s;ee whether it was not po&s;&s;ible to bring out &s;omething like an explanation, of two pa&s;|&s;ions, of which Olivia had, as yet, no &s;u&s;|picion;
<PB N="113" REF="123">&mdash;he was ha&s;tily running his eye over the pages, in order to &s;eparate the commu|nicable &s;entiments, from &s;uch as could not &s;afely be read aloud,&mdash;when Olivia repeat|ed her wi&s;h, "That he would repair to the abbey," promi&s;ing to hear his friend's ac|count when he returned.&mdash;You provoking thing, you!" cried Olivia,&mdash;"I feel that I &s;hall love the &s;i&s;ter as well as you do the brother;&mdash;and here, you are &s;o taken up with your friend&s;hip for the latter, that you are lo&s;ing the only opportunity which may happen this age, of bringing me and the former together.&mdash;Upon my life, I &s;hall again &s;u&s;pect you have taken &s;ome unwar|rantable prejudice again&s;t that &s;weet girl, and do not love her half &s;o well as you ought.&mdash;Set off this in&s;tant, if you would not have me feel confirmed in this hard &s;u&s;|picion."</P>
<P>Olivia drew him, betwixt &s;port and &s;e|riou&s;ne&s;s, towards the door, where Henry exclaimed&mdash;"Ah! Olivia, if you knew the condition of that excellent young man, Charles Stuart, at this moment, your gentle
<PB N="114" REF="124">heart would pity him."&mdash;"His condition!" an&s;wered Olivia:&mdash;"good heaven! has any thing befallen him?"&mdash;"He is, and long has been, &s;uffering all the tortures of an hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion!"&mdash;"Then I pity him, indeed!" &s;aid Olivia,&mdash;"for I do really think, were &s;uch a misfortune to have happened to me, it would have broken my heart.&mdash;I know my&s;elf, Hen|ry, &s;o well," added &s;he,&mdash;"it would have kill|ed me;&mdash;and, indeed, the certainty of that would be my only con&s;olation.&mdash;Poor Charles!&mdash;he is an amiable creature."&mdash; "He is one of the noble&s;t young men upon earth," an&s;wered Henry,&mdash;"and would make the be&s;t woman in it the happie&s;t."&mdash;"What, then, prevents the lady of his choice from being &s;o?&mdash;Can &s;he be in&s;en&s;ible to the affection of &s;uch a lover?"&mdash;"I do not believe," replied Henry,&mdash;"though it has been of &s;ome &s;tanding, and they have been very often together,&mdash;that &s;he yet &s;o much as &s;u&s;pects his pa&s;&s;ion."&mdash;"That's very &s;trange," &s;aid Olivia:&mdash;"you ought to do all you can to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, my dear Henry;&mdash;I am &s;ure the kind youth would do the like
<PB N="115" REF="125">good office by you;&mdash;nay, he has &s;poke to me of you an hundred times, not in &s;o animated a manner, indeed, as you de&s;erve, but very, very warmly:&mdash;he perceived your virtues wanted no advocate!&mdash;I prote&s;t, if I knew the lady, I would try all the force of my little eloquence, to win her heart for him.&mdash;Why does not his divine &s;i&s;ter exert her powers?&mdash;Can any one re&s;i&s;t her?&mdash;Me|thinks, we &s;hould all confederate, combat, and conquer in his cau&s;e:&mdash;are you not of this opinion?"</P>
<P>Here was another home que&s;tion, a&s;ked in the utmo&s;t &s;implicity of Olivia's heart, which &s;incerely ached for Charles.&mdash;Henry turned round, and walked away to the window.&mdash; "I do not wonder that you are unea&s;y," continued Olivia:&mdash;"but what can be the rea&s;on of the lady's Indifference?&mdash;Is &s;he already engaged?"</P>
<P>"Fatally &s;o, I fear," replied Henry.&mdash;"That's terrible!" an&s;wered Olivia.</P>
<P>"And to a man who is him&s;elf betrothed in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner to another," cried Henry.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="126">"Wor&s;e and wor&s;e!" rejoined Olivia:&mdash;"and does that other lady return her lover's pa&s;&s;ion?"</P>
<P>"Entirely!"</P>
<P>"And, I &s;uppo&s;e, the gentleman's affec|tion is as great."</P>
<P>"It is, alas! it is."</P>
<P>"I know not, then, what can be done for your poor friend: for the ca&s;e &s;eems to have &s;hut out all &s;ervice, all good offices.&mdash;I do not &s;ee a &s;ingle opening to promote his &s;uit:&mdash;for who, you know, would attempt to divide two hearts already united, to make <HI>any</HI> third happy?&mdash;Make the ca&s;e our own a moment, my dear Henry:&mdash;we &s;hould ne|ver bear even the <HI>&s;ight</HI> of the wicked &s;educer of the affections of Henry and Olivia, for in&s;tance, even though we were both per|fectly convinced, all his or her arts would be vain.&mdash;I prote&s;t, my blood runs cold at the very thought of &s;uch a mon&s;ter!</P>
<P>"Neverthele&s;s, the condition of the un|happy Charles," added Olivia, after a reco|vering pau&s;e, and finding Henry much di&s;|turbed,&mdash;"is dreadful indeed!&mdash;And I
<PB N="117" REF="127">am not &s;urpri&s;ed at the mi&s;ery I &s;ee you are &s;uffering on the occa&s;ion;&mdash;I now clearly perceive that your &s;ympathi&s;ing heart has made this one of the &s;tronge&s;t &s;ources of your late, alas! too frequent, melancholy;&mdash;I cannot blame you for it; it fills my own brea&s;t with grief; and I weep that I cannot mitigate it."</P>
<P>Henry was extremely affected, more e|&s;pecially as Olivia now applied all that her tenderne&s;s could devi&s;e, to give him com|fort;&mdash;and, though intended to promote a very different emotion, to fill up the mea|&s;ure of his de&s;pair on his friend's &s;ubject and his own, &s;he took his hand, and carry|ing it to her lips, where it received a cha&s;te and delicate pre&s;&s;ure,&mdash;"How infinitely grateful am I to you, my beloved Henry!" &s;he exclaimed,&mdash;"and how grateful ought we both to be to heaven, for exempting us from tho&s;e agoni&s;ing trials, which are, and mu&s;t be, in&s;eparable from hopele&s;s love!&mdash; Oh! that your friend could experience the felicity which is permitted you and me, Henry, to feel at this moment, with the
<PB N="118" REF="128">&s;anction of both our dear parents upon our heads!&mdash;I cannot feel my ble&s;&s;ed &s;tate, with|out the tears of joy gu&s;hing from the fulne&s;s of my happy heart.&mdash;I &s;ee you &s;hare my &s;en|&s;ations;&mdash;long, long may the &s;acred &s;ympa|thy continue! and may the&s;e drops&mdash;"&s;he wiped away the tears which were run|ning along Henry's pallid cheek,&mdash;"may the&s;e drops of overflowing felicity be the only ones Olivia's tenderne&s;s or your own &s;hall bring from your eyes!"</P>
<P>"In pity, cea&s;e, Olivia!" cried Henry:&mdash;"I can bear no more."</P>
<P>"Let us &s;eparate a little while," an&s;wer|ed Olivia, with the mo&s;t bewitching ac|cents:&mdash;"compo&s;e your&s;elf, my deare&s;t friend, and then pur&s;ue your walk:&mdash;the air will re&s;tore you; and be &s;ure you try to make Caroline love your Olivia, as Charles does Henry, when we are all friends."</P>
<P>Olivia now made an effort to rally her &s;pirits, that &s;he might recover tho&s;e of Henry.</P>
<P>"When we are all friends, and mixed together, you, I, Caroline, and Charles,&mdash;
<PB N="119" REF="129">we may beguile the latter of his griefs:&mdash;at lea&s;t, our loving endeavours &s;hall not be wanting;&mdash;I in&s;i&s;t, therefore, upon your &s;etting off; and I will give you, as you have &s;o great an undertaking in hand, leave of ab&s;ence for the whole afternoon."</P>
<P>Olivia was again leading Henry out, when, recollecting her&s;elf, &s;he cried, "But &s;top a moment: I have had &s;omething of yours in my pocket the&s;e two days:&mdash;your brother John &s;ent it me;&mdash;and it is very charmingly fini&s;hed indeed! My father &s;ays,&mdash;and &s;o does yours,&mdash;it is much more like than when you &s;aw it before; but, for my part, I really think it a thou&s;and times too hand&s;ome."</P>
<P>Before Olivia had fini&s;hed her prefacing &s;peech, &s;he had taken out of her pocket, and unfolded, a little parcel, which proved to be that miniature of her&s;elf, which the conflicting John had painted for Henry, and which was now re-given, by the lovely original, with a grace, and at a moment, which might have en&s;ured its welcome, al|mo&s;t from an enemy,&mdash;much more from the
<PB N="120" REF="130">deeply penetrated, though unfortunate Henry.</P>
<P>As he received it from Olivia, &s;he &s;aid, "Tell the truth, now, Henry,&mdash;does it not flatter me greatly? Yet do not tell me &s;o: for I &s;hould weep, if I were to think your fancy and affection could not draw as partial a likene&s;s as any painter in the world!&mdash;&s;o take it with you; and, as I can not, with any propriety, go with you to the abbey ju&s;t yet, let it be my &s;ub&s;titute;&mdash;and be &s;ure you &s;hew it to Mi&s;s Stuart, and tell her that I &s;end it as my repre&s;entative; and if it could &s;peak, it would &s;oon make out my dream:&mdash;do not forget this, I charge you.&mdash;So now I will go to poor Jane.&mdash;I declare, Henry, I can never get from you, and mu&s;t run away at la&s;t."</P>

<P>HENRY had an anxious de&s;ire to make his per&s;onal enquiries after his father, but was really afraid to encounter him.&mdash;Under the different impre&s;&s;ions, therefore, of that
<PB N="121" REF="131">tender father's di&s;plea&s;ure,&mdash;of his brother John's &s;ilence,&mdash;of Olivia's overwhelming goodne&s;s,&mdash;of Charles's genero&s;ity, and di|&s;tre&s;s, &mdash;of Caroline's &s;ummons,&mdash;and of Sir Gui&s;e's my&s;terious invitation,&mdash;he once more took the road that led to the abbey;&mdash;at the &s;ight of which man&s;ion, after again read|ing Caroline's billet, as he pa&s;t along the great avenue, his heart began to re&s;ume its ac|cu&s;tomed emotions;&mdash;and, as he approached within view of that little window already commemorated in this hi&s;tory, tho&s;e emotions increa&s;ed;&mdash;and, by the time he gained the grand portico, late &s;o &s;ternly clo&s;ed upon him, and now to be &s;o wide opened, by <HI>authority,</HI> they totally ab&s;orbed every other con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>To &s;ay the truth, Caroline her&s;elf had, for &s;ome time, thought it &s;trange,&mdash;perhaps taken it a little to heart,&mdash;that Henry had not, &s;ince the evening of the funeral, made an <HI>effort</HI> to vi&s;it at the abbey.&mdash;She was &s;a|tisfied of the great propriety of his conduct; it was certainly what prudence pre&s;cribed; and, had he attempted to act otherwi&s;e, it
<PB N="122" REF="132">is probable &s;he would have marked out the very line of behaviour he ought to have pur&s;ued; and declared her&s;elf much di&s;&s;a|tisfied, had he not obeyed.&mdash;Yet Love, my good reader, is,&mdash;as peradventure thine own heart can atte&s;t,&mdash;a very incon&s;i&s;tent deity, and can very much approve and di&s;|approve, be plea&s;ed and angry, at the &s;ame time, and at the &s;ame thing. Caroline had as lively a remembrance of the parting look &s;he be&s;towed upon Henry, at the abbey gates, on the night, or rather on the morn|ing after the funeral, as if &s;he had &s;een it on her countenance in a mirrour;&mdash;and &s;he thought it expre&s;&s;ed enough of gratitude and affection, to hold out a future welcome, and almo&s;t beckon him towards her.&mdash;There was no immediate probability, indeed, of his meeting with any &s;uch welcome, but, on the contrary, every likelihood of a repul&s;e from Sir Gui&s;e, and, con&s;equently, from her&s;elf;&mdash;and yet, perhaps, &s;he would have been better &s;atisfied, had he hazarded this, than, as it appeared to her, to be &s;o over exact, as wholly to e&s;trange him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="133">If there &s;eems any thing in the&s;e ob&s;erva|tions incongruous to the reader, we can &s;afely refer him to our patrone&s;s, Nature,&mdash;from whom every word has been faithfully copied.

<P>Henry's conduct at the funeral, however,&mdash;his defence of Sir Gui&s;e,&mdash;his attention and delicate con&s;ideration at the awful cere|mony which preceded the affray,&mdash;wrought very powerfully in his favour with Caro|line; and &s;he was truly de&s;irous of an oppor|tunity to pay him her heart's acknowledge|ments;&mdash;indeed, &s;uch de&s;ire began to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her the very hour &s;he bade him, or rather looked him, an adieu, and had continued increa&s;ing ever &s;ince.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XVII.</HEAD>
<P>THE reader hath in perfect recollec|tion, no doubt,&mdash;becau&s;e it was a very mate|rialpoint,&mdash;the worthy re&s;olution of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart, to become, at lea&s;t in his external behaviour to his own family and even to the Fitzortons, an <HI>altered man:</HI>&mdash;now, as this could not be done without a con|&s;iderable degree of addre&s;s, he re&s;orted to a power, who&s;e aid and in&s;piration he al|ways invoked, whenever he had any great undertaking to perform;&mdash;and, to conceal the bittere&s;t re&s;entment, and deadlie&s;t hate, certainly came under that de&s;cription. This tutelary power was neither any of the de|mons above nor below, but, &s;imply and &s;olely, that bo&s;om friend which enabled
<PB N="125" REF="135">him to effect his foule&s;t intents more com|pletely than if he had been in league with all the infernal deities,&mdash;namely, his own fraudful heart.&mdash;This, indeed, was all-&s;uf|ficient, as well to &s;ugge&s;t evil thoughts, as to devi&s;e the means of carrying them into execution;&mdash;and, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, it not only empowered him to conceal the hate and re&s;entment above-mentioned, but to &s;ub&s;titute, in their places, the faire&s;t ap|pearances of forgivene&s;s and good-will;&mdash; in &s;hort, he was a ma&s;ter in that great and u&s;eful &s;cience to a determined knave, &s;o finely de&s;cribed by Shake&s;peare:&mdash;
<Q>He could &s;mile, and &s;mile, and be a villain.</Q> He began to put in practice a &s;y&s;tem of this kind, immediately after the funeral.&mdash;As he &s;at at breakfa&s;t the &s;ucceeding day, "Caro|line," &s;aid he,&mdash;"your brother having thought proper to leave us at &s;uch a time to our&s;elves, we mu&s;t comfort each other as well as we can.&mdash;This is but a melancho|ly hou&s;e at pre&s;ent, my dear:&mdash;&s;uppo&s;e we
<PB N="126" REF="136">were to leave it, and walk out a little into the air:&mdash;it may be of &s;ervice to us both."</P>
<P>He took her hand, and they walked into the garden.&mdash;Meeting Denni&s;on upon their return into the hou&s;e, Sir Gui&s;e exclaimed, "Tell the gardener to be particularly care|ful of tho&s;e myrtles in the corner of the hot|hou&s;e,&mdash;they were the favourites of your poor lady."&mdash;"And one of them, I &s;ee, is drooping," cried Caroline,&mdash;"as if it mourn|ed her lo&s;s."&mdash;"Good Denni&s;on, let <HI>this</HI> be remembered:" continued Sir Gui&s;e. Hav|ing &s;aid which, he held his handkerchief to his face, and &s;hed as many tears as were con&s;i&s;tent with his grief. Caroline had her|&s;elf noticed the&s;e myrtles, as &s;he pa&s;t the green-hou&s;e, and be&s;towed upon them many of tho&s;e drops of real &s;ympathy, which might give her father the hint to counter|feit, thinking that as good as any other piece of hypocri&s;y, to advance his plan.&mdash;A more perfect example of genuine and af|fected &s;orrow hath rarely been &s;een, than what the father and daughter then exhi|bited.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="137">Denni&s;on, like Caroline, was touched by the novelty of this conduct.&mdash;They were &s;oon convinced it was not the &s;tart of the mo|ment, by an increa&s;e of good humour the next day, and &s;o on, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as well to the re&s;t of the &s;ervants, as to Denni&s;on:&mdash;and at length the whole kitchen pro|nounced their ma&s;ter to be, <HI>bona fide,</HI> a new man:&mdash;prior to which, Charles had written, but not by Caroline's medium, &s;uch letters of reproach and menace to his father, that, po&s;&s;ibly, the fear of that which they threat|ened being put in execution, might have &s;ome weight in bringing about this marvel|lous reformation.&mdash;The baronet, however, without communicating the contents of the letters to Caroline, an&s;wered them in the mo&s;t unexpected manner, to the entire &s;a|tisfaction of Charles, who thereupon wrote the letter to Henry, which has been com|municated in a former chapter.</P>
<P>But this was not all.&mdash;The conduct of Sir Gui&s;e was of the mo&s;t general kind, and ex|tended even to Father Arthur. He made
<PB N="128" REF="138">ample confe&s;&s;ion of the errors of the pa&s;t, promi&s;ing as large atonement in future.</P>
<P>And in regard to Caroline, he was every day propo&s;ing &s;ome little plan of con&s;ola|tion,&mdash;gave her one of his favourite hor&s;es,&mdash;and not only allowed Denni&s;on and an|other &s;ervant to attend her, but often accom|panied her him&s;elf, more than once intro|ducing the name of the Fitzortons, and par|ticularly Charles's favourite and her own, without any other allu&s;ion to old grievances than ob&s;erving that it was a great pity when neighbours could not agree:&mdash;there were always faults on both &s;ides:&mdash;for his part he looked upon implacable hatred as the blacke&s;t among&s;t the crimes, ina&s;much as it was the farthe&s;t removed from the re|lenting mercy of him who is ready to par|don all our tre&s;pa&s;&s;es whenever his forgive|ne&s;s is piou&s;ly and unaffectedly &s;ought. Holding &s;uch &s;ound doctrine as this before Caroline and Denni&s;on,&mdash;particularly in the pre&s;ence of Father Arthur,&mdash;he by degrees &s;o thoroughly per&s;uaded the&s;e, and indeed
<PB N="129" REF="139">the whole family, that his reformation and repentance were &s;incere, that Stuart Abbey now re&s;ounded the prai&s;es of the man who&s;e vices all its echoes had before &s;o often re|peated.</P>
<P>This happy change was attributed by all to the &s;alutary impre&s;&s;ions made on the good baronet's con&s;cience when he came to reflect on the fate of his lady. In private di&s;cour&s;es of this matter among them&s;elves, Denni&s;on ob&s;erved, "it was a long lane that had no turning;" and that "it was better late than never,"&mdash;recounting, at the &s;ame time, an hi&s;tory which he conceived to be in point, "of a poor wretch who had been in a con&s;tant habit of all manner of wickedne&s;s, till he was turned of &s;ixty, and then took up all at once, becau&s;e his con|&s;cience would not let him &s;leep a-nights; whereupon he made his peace with God, and was &s;o good a Chri&s;tian before he died, that, though he was as &s;inful a creature as Sir Gui&s;e before, all the pari&s;h ble&s;&s;ed him, and went to his burial."</P>
<P>Father Arthur gave the prai&s;e of this con|ver&s;ion
<PB N="130" REF="140">where he thought it due,&mdash;to the great re&s;torer,&mdash;and took more than his ac|cu&s;tomed delight to vi&s;it at the abbey. For the pa&s;t week, indeed, he had been an in|mate, often wandering in the woods of Stuart, &s;o well calculated to in&s;pire and cheri&s;h meditation, till the hour of repa&s;t, which he would take with the family,&mdash;and then, devoting an evening hour to private prayer, which was his invariable cu&s;tom, he would remain in &s;ocial endearment, yielding to all the felicities of his mind and con&s;titu|tion till bed-time.</P>
<P>The happine&s;s of Caroline was indeed ex|treme;&mdash;her gratitude to her father was in proportion;&mdash;and had &s;he not now and then retired to her chamber to &s;hed a tear of re|gret to think that her dear mother lived not to witne&s;s and to &s;hare this ble&s;&s;ed alteration, her happine&s;s would have been without al|loy; for, be&s;ides the above felicity, a pro&s;pect of reconciliation opened once more on the hou&s;es of Fitzorton and Stuart. She even had the comfort of hearing, and being her|&s;elf permitted to mention, the name of Hen|ry
<PB N="131" REF="141">with due re&s;pect:&mdash;her brother was made partaker of her joy,&mdash;and her favourite Fa|ther Arthur no longer with-held his vi&s;its on the &s;core of &s;hunning the hou&s;e of &s;trife, where he had &s;o often found it impo&s;&s;ible to be a peace-maker.</P>
<P>And in &s;o fair a train was the general happine&s;s, that on the day &s;he encountered the party at the manor-hou&s;e gate &s;he would a&s;&s;uredly have forgot &s;he had a little &s;ecret quarrel with Henry, for not doing that, which, had he done, &s;he would have re&s;ent|ed, &mdash;and have told him the delightful tidings which &s;he had in &s;tore for him, had not the &s;udden appearance of Jenny Atwood, the &s;ight of whom might have thrown a cloud over all the&s;e agreeable pro&s;pects, made it impo&s;&s;ible for her to &s;ay or do more than has already been &s;hewn to the reader.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE abbey door was opened to the &s;ummons of Henry Fitzorton by the good and tru&s;ty Denni&s;on, who gave him a thou|&s;and
<PB N="132" REF="142">welcomes as he entered, and en&s;ured it to him afterwards in the following words, which, after the fa&s;hion of the &s;peaker, were delivered as he led the way to the ob|ject of Henry's wi&s;hes.&mdash;"Joyful news, as I told you, dear &s;quire!&mdash;the old gentleman, and God be prai&s;ed for it, has renounced the Devil and all his works. He's clean and clever another thing,&mdash;and he makes us all weep for joy, more than he u&s;ed here|tofore to make us cry for grief. He has made young ma&s;ter happy al&s;o!&mdash;Mi&s;s Ca|roline is e'en almo&s;t a&s;ide her&s;elf,&mdash;and my old wits are about to take leave of me:&mdash;and for the matter of that, if I thought ma|&s;ter would be at his old tricks again, in the way of relap&s;es as they call 'em, I had ra|ther bid them good bye now;&mdash;for if the Devil &s;hould come into the old boy any more, it would be wor&s;e than before, your honour knows."</P>
<P>"True, very true!" an&s;wered Henry, who &s;haking Denni&s;on heartily by the hand, ex|claimed in the words of Othello, thinking perhaps rather of his approaching inter|view,
<PB N="133" REF="143">than the old man's de&s;cription of Sir Gui&s;e, though it would well apply to both, &mdash;"If I were now to die," my dear Denni|&s;on, "I were now to be mo&s;t happy!"</P>
<P>"See what it is to be a &s;cholar!&mdash;Learn|ing is better than hou&s;e or land, after all," quoth Denni&s;on;&mdash;"but here," added the old man, opening the door of that very apartment from which, &s;ome weeks before, Henry had been expelled,&mdash;"here is that which is better and prettier than hou&s;e, land, and learning, put 'em all together!"</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e and Caroline were both in the room, and both ro&s;e to receive Henry. "Mr. Fitzorton," &s;aid the former, bowing familiarly, "I had promi&s;ed my&s;elf you would have obeyed a lady's &s;ummons more willingly; in which ca&s;e I &s;hould have had more of your company:&mdash;but &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s calls me out:&mdash;I mu&s;t therefore leave Caro|line in the double charge of doing the ho|nours of my welcome and her own." Sir Gui&s;e, repeating his bow, went forth.</P>
<P>We &s;ee as palpably, dear reader, as if we were now looking thee full in the face, and
<PB N="134" REF="144">through that could penetrate into the re|ce&s;&s;es of thy heart, that thou art making thy&s;elf up, in this place, to hear &s;ome of the many &s;ublime and beautiful &s;entiments which now fell from the enamoured Henry, and enraptured Caroline; and, therefore, though it were extremely ea&s;y for us,&mdash;did we prefer fancies to facts,&mdash;to fill a very ho|ne&s;t modern volume with what they might be <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> to &s;ay,&mdash;it would be the mo&s;t difficult matter in the whole art of book|making, to eke out one &s;entence, with what, for the &s;pace of &s;everal minutes, they really did <HI>not</HI> &s;ay;&mdash;and that, for nearly as &s;ub|&s;tantial a rea&s;on as ever was given, viz. be|cau&s;e neither of them, during that period of time, &s;poke a &s;ingle word:&mdash;and upon con|&s;ulting our godde&s;s, (thou remembere&s;t the deity here &s;poken of, is <HI>Nature</HI>) we find it recorded, in a minute of her own divine hand writing,&mdash;"The&s;e lovers did not for &s;o long a &s;pace enter into di&s;cour&s;e, for two of my mo&s;t powerful rea&s;ons,&mdash;fir&s;t, becau&s;e they had too many things to di&s;cour&s;e upon, to know which to begin with,&mdash;and &s;econd|ly,
<PB N="135" REF="145">becau&s;e their tenderne&s;s was <HI>un&s;peak|able."</HI></P>
<P>Their actions, however, were &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ive, leaving indeed other language unnece&s;&s;ary. Henry held Caroline in his arms; and Caroline, perhaps for the fir&s;t time &s;ince &s;he became &s;en&s;ible to the thrill|ing power of his magic touch, did not &s;hrink from his embrace. In this &s;ituation they gazed on each other with &s;o perfect a joy, that they were deluged in a flood of tho&s;e tears which at once enrich and give relief to heart-felt felicity, but are de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ied to the exce&s;&s;es of woe;&mdash;the tran&s;ports of the fir&s;t admitting of tho&s;e &s;alutary &s;treams which fre&s;hen as they fall; whil&s;t the par|oxy&s;ms of the latter are denied this balmy relief.

<Q>To leave no channels for the tide of tears.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="146">Having remained, as we have &s;aid, &s;e|veral minutes in this &s;ituation of inde&s;criba|ble ec&s;tacy, nature permitted Caroline fir&s;t to &s;peak,&mdash;and, with a frankne&s;s that de|mon&s;trated &s;he was &s;uperior to the little pride of giving pain when it was con&s;i&s;tent with her &s;en&s;e of right to impart plea&s;ure, &s;he a&s;&s;ured Henry that, as the happine&s;s of now telling him, as far as words <HI>could</HI> tell, <HI>how unutterably</HI> dear he was to her, was derived from her father's goodne&s;s, &s;he he&s;itated not to con|fe&s;s it was the only truly con&s;olatory mo|ment &s;he had experienced &s;ince her mo|ther's death,&mdash;and, but for that ever-la|mented event, would perhaps be the mo&s;t bli&s;sful period of her whole life. "Ah! your own good and ju&s;t heart, my deare&s;t Hen|ry," &s;aid &s;he, "will inform you what mine has often told me,&mdash;that then only can it dare to avow its felicity, when that felicity is-&s;anctioned by tho&s;e who gave us life." When &s;he had &s;aid this, her beautiful hand was pre&s;ented in a way that ju&s;tified her &s;entiment; and though perhaps the doc|trine

<P>It is probable that Henry would have given in at the &s;ame time &s;ome other reply &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion, had he not been prevented by Caroline, who, anxious to &s;a|tisfy her heart, in the mid&s;t of its own hap|pine&s;s, about that of others, prefaced her enquiries after Olivia and Jenny Atwood, by ob&s;erving, "that &s;he never &s;hould quite forgive either Henry, or her brother Charles, for the niggard manner in which they had both de&s;cribed Mi&s;s Clare, who," &s;aid Ca|roline, "is ab&s;olutely a Grace,&mdash;a love,&mdash;a cherubim!&mdash;I have thought of nothing el&s;e, Henry, except your&s;elf.&mdash;Do you know, &s;he has grown out of my recol|lection.

<P>The tell-tale in his cheek might literally be &s;aid too often to put him out of coun|tenance,&mdash;and either ob&s;truct or contradict the &s;tory of his tongue.&mdash;And though there is a blu&s;h which denies, and a blu&s;h which confe&s;&s;es,&mdash;they are frequently confounded and mi&s;taken, even by per&s;ons who are thought to be the mo&s;t &s;kilful interpreters of &s;ilent language.&mdash;The manner in which Ca|roline con&s;trued the blu&s;h before us, may be &s;een in what follows.</P>

<P>A few minutes previou&s;ly to this conver|&s;ation, Henry had, in obedience to Olivia's wi&s;h, pre&s;ented, with proper comments as he delivered his me&s;&s;age, that lovely girl's miniature:&mdash;but even this, as it turned out, was an addition to his misfortunes;&mdash;for, as Caroline &s;urveyed the well-imitated counte|nance, her own actual vi&s;age coloured to crim&s;on;&mdash;&s;he admitted the exce&s;&s;ive like|ne&s;s, the extreme beauty:&mdash;&s;he even pre&s;&s;ed it to her lips, and declared it repre&s;ented an angel in beauty as in graces: yet her voice
<PB N="140" REF="150">faultered, her eye filled with tears, her lips quivered; and, le&s;t it &s;hould drop from her trembling hand, &s;he laid it down.&mdash;Henry &s;aw, with &s;trangely mingled emotions, that the &s;ublime Caroline could fear and feel a &s;uppo&s;ed rival.</P>
<P>Henry could not but make the di&s;covery with a proud and heart-felt con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that he was mo&s;t dear to her whom he ad|ored: but he &s;till found him&s;elf daily more and more entangled in the web of his per|plexing de&s;tiny,&mdash;even as if he had been as dark and in&s;idious a double-dealer as Sir Gui&s;e Stuart, the difference appearing only in the motives of their conduct;&mdash;but this difference, indeed, forms the di&s;tinction be|twixt the evils of vice, and the trials of virtue.&mdash;While a &s;en&s;ation like this was oppre&s;&s;ing him, he fixed his eyes on tho&s;e of Caroline, and exclaimed:&mdash;"Good Hea|ven! when&mdash;when &s;hall the unfortunate Henry be under&s;tood by any body?"</P>
<P>"He <HI>is</HI> under&s;tood," an&s;wered Caroline, taking his hand, and rai&s;ing the back of it
<PB N="141" REF="151">to her lips:&mdash;"and thus I &s;olicit forgivene&s;s for the&mdash;I hope&mdash;almo&s;t only unworthy emotions, begun in &s;port, and continued to &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, that ever my bo&s;om harbour|ed.&mdash;Oh! may they never more be its gue&s;ts!&mdash;how has Caroline dared for a moment to expre&s;s a doubt of Henry Fitzorton's faith, his oaths, his honour?&mdash;I &s;ee and acknow|ledge the ju&s;tice of his reproach: the ac|cu&s;ing &s;pirit arms his countenance!&mdash;Yes, well may that deep indignation which over|&s;preads his face, be kindled again&s;t Caroline! Would &s;he had been as incapable of a ba&s;e &s;u&s;picion, as he is of the treachery that would warrant it!&mdash;and yet, Henry, the &s;tronge&s;t te&s;t of our affection is the weakne&s;s of our fears, even when we are a&s;&s;ured they are without a &s;hadow of foundation! But, as indifference never felt tho&s;e fears,&mdash;nay, as indeed nothing but the mo&s;t unalterable love was ever guilty of this weakne&s;s, if guilt it can be called,&mdash;&s;urely my Henry will forgive it:&mdash;perhaps he will do more than forgive! &s;hould it add energy to his own affection,&mdash;
<PB N="142" REF="152">if it be not more <HI>unju&s;t</HI> than vain in me, to &s;uppo&s;e it <HI>capable</HI> of addition,&mdash;his pardon is perhaps the only thing which can teach me to forgive my&s;elf:&mdash;alas! my own anger, I have ever found,&mdash;what you have often told me of the &s;elf-rebuking of the noble John,&mdash; is the mo&s;t intolerable to bear!&mdash;but this is a mi&s;ery my beloved Henry can never have had cau&s;e to inflict upon him&s;elf."</P>
<P>Henry caught her pa&s;&s;ionately in his arms, &s;till &s;truggling with his emotions: and Caro|line, &mdash;feeling that the &s;uppo&s;ed crime of accu&s;ation could not be too effectually done away,&mdash;entered at once into the plan of happine&s;s, which &s;he earne&s;tly hoped would re&s;ult to both families, from her fa|ther's pre&s;ent favourable di&s;po&s;ition towards them.&mdash;"Surely, my deare&s;t Henry, this may be improved;&mdash;our beloved Charles may have his &s;hare in the accommodation;&mdash;I have a whi&s;per for you about him, and the lovelier original of this lovely &s;imilitude:&mdash;I will tell it you, when you have entirely &s;ealed my pardon, and reconciled me to my|&s;elf.

<P>The&s;e expre&s;&s;ions Caroline accompanied by &s;uch atoning &s;miles, and by tho&s;e little endearing attentions which are of &s;uch im|mea&s;urable magnitude in matters of affec|tion,&mdash;that, had Henry really been as di&s;|plea&s;ed as he had been delighted, and but half as much in love as the reader knows he was,&mdash;he mu&s;t not only have forgiven but forgotten all her offences;&mdash;and, more|over, circum&s;tanced as he was at this obli|vious moment, he mu&s;t him&s;elf be pardon|ed for neglecting to avail him&s;elf of &s;o fair an opportunity to explain his Family Secret, at lea&s;t to Caroline.&mdash;Her tenderne&s;s, indeed, was as balm and oil poured upon his wounds:&mdash;and he had almo&s;t lo&s;t the &s;en&s;e of angui&s;h in the &s;olace of her love, now as unbounded in expre&s;&s;ion, as in feeling. But, &s;ome farther que&s;tions &s;he put him, by way of fini&s;hing the whole,&mdash;and fini&s;hers in truth they were,&mdash;tore open again all tho&s;e wounds, and made them bleed with renovated fury.
<PB N="144" REF="154">"How&mdash;ah how, my Henry," &s;aid &s;he,&mdash;"even now <HI>my</HI> father, Sir Gui&s;e Stuart, is not aver&s;e to our happine&s;s,&mdash;how is <HI>yours,</HI>&mdash;how is Sir Armine Fitzorton to be reconciled to accept of&mdash;of&mdash;of&mdash;?"</P>
<P>Caroline held down her head; and a very different hue&mdash;the hue of fear&mdash;u&s;urped her cheek.&mdash;"Even now that Sir Gui&s;e is become fully &s;en&s;ible of his &s;on's exalted merits,&mdash;how will the venerable father of &s;uch a &s;on," &s;aid &s;he, "be per&s;uaded to give his honouring hand to Caroline?&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e it has been impo&s;&s;ible for my Henry even to glance at this circum&s;tance: but po&s;&s;ibly&mdash;for I know your generous &s;olicitude&mdash;po&s;&s;ibly you may have employed your brother John, who, I am &s;ure, bears good will to Charles, and mu&s;t adore you;&mdash;or your brother James may have undertaken to &s;ound your father on this &s;ubject:&mdash;or the &s;weet Olivia her&s;elf, who has a face and figure to convert hate into love,&mdash;by the bye, I cannot think how you came to prefer me to that angel;&mdash;'tis well for <HI>me</HI> that love is blind:&mdash;I &s;ay, Hen|ry, it may be that you have got that charm|ing

<P>Caroline had hardly ended her interroga|tories, before Denni&s;on came to the door, rather &s;tealing in than delivering a letter, which, he &s;aid, was brought from the ca&s;tle, in great ha&s;te, by Mr. True George, and that he believed it required an an&s;wer.&mdash;Denni&s;on, however,&mdash;having, like George, an high veneration for the privacy of all true lovers, and e&s;pecially the&s;e,&mdash;no &s;ooner perceived they were in earne&s;t di&s;cour&s;e, than he immediately withdrew, &s;aying he

<P>IT is mo&s;t likely, Henry knew not, in his extreme confu&s;ion, more than half the contents of this epi&s;tle, &s;o calculated to a&s;to|ni&s;h, perplex, and terrify even Caroline:&mdash;the blow precluded all pre&s;ence of mind, and cut down all energy of character. While &s;he was reading the fateful letter, the di&s;|a&s;trous Henry &s;at rocking him&s;elf in a chair, with his hands &s;pread over his face.</P>
<P>Caroline now perceived that &s;he had be|fore &s;poken but too prophetically,&mdash;that &s;he had been long &s;upplanting another woman,&mdash;and that woman an inmate of her lover's family,&mdash;each, and all of whom, with the con|currence of her own father, approved of the alliance.&mdash;She had not, for &s;ome time, the power of utterance, or of motion;&mdash;but vainly trying to fold up and return the pac|quet,
<PB N="153" REF="163">&s;he let one of the &s;heets fall to the ground, and begging Henry's pardon, at|tempted to pick it up;&mdash;then tottering to|wards the neare&s;t chair, &s;he &s;unk into it, and remained in tearle&s;s con&s;ternation, &s;omething in the way we before de&s;cribed her in the dying moments of her mother;&mdash; and, indeed, an affection cheri&s;hed, even in the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t trying circum&s;tances, for many years, even till it had twi&s;ted with the fibres of her heart,&mdash;might now, be &s;aid to be in its la&s;t agonies,&mdash;and from a wound as &s;udden as fatal.&mdash;At length &s;he made an effort to ri&s;e, with intent to leave the apartment:&mdash;Henry ob&s;erving her, ro&s;e al&s;o, and throwing him&s;elf at her feet, "I perceive you look upon me to be far more culpable than I am," &s;aid he;&mdash;"and you impute to treachery the effect of dire misfortune.&mdash;I call, therefore, as well upon your ju&s;tice, as your humanity, to hear me."&mdash;Without waiting for her permi&s;&s;ion or re|ply, he recapitulated, as clearly as he was able, the whole &s;ecret hi&s;tory of his &s;ituation with Olivia,&mdash;with the long train of my&s;teries,
<PB N="154" REF="164">perils, and penalties, that had attended it, from the fir&s;t moment of his di&s;covering the family de&s;igns, to the very in&s;tant of his taking leave of her at the ca&s;tle.

He enumerated the &s;undry and manifold attempts he had made towards this, to each, to all,&mdash;and the ways and means by which all his purpo&s;es were defeated.</P>
<P>The forcible manner in which he painted the&s;e &s;ad truths, and the agonies he had endured, from this nece&s;&s;ary &s;uppre&s;&s;ion,&mdash;his abhorrence of all duplicity, notwith|&s;tanding the appearance of having acted the

<P>He did not, however, remain long in this condition;&mdash;for a gentleman entered the room &s;oon after, who came, in this cri&s;is, as a comforter,&mdash;being his &s;econd appear|ance in that character.&mdash;This was no other than Sir Gui&s;e Stuart, who was extremely &s;urpri&s;ed to find him alone, and equally con|cerned at &s;eeing him &s;o much out of &s;pirits.&mdash;Henry, hereupon, notwith&s;tanding his for|mer ill-luck when he tried to gain the baro|net over to his intere&s;t, was now &s;o tho|roughly convinced of the &s;incerity of that gentleman's reform, that he repeated the

At pre&s;ent, our entire attention is called to Caroline Stuart, who re-entered the room almo&s;t in the &s;ame moment her father had left it.&mdash;She had been in tears.&mdash;Her vi&s;age was pale, and her limbs yet trembled.&mdash;With le&s;s interruption, however, than &s;he had her&s;elf apprehended, &s;he at length addre&s;&s;ed Henry:&mdash;"Though I ex|pected,

<P>CAROLINE pau&s;ed and wept.&mdash;She then recapitulated his &s;ituation,&mdash;placed be|fore him all the &s;trong parts of his duty, and her own,&mdash;&s;hewed, in new points of view, the irre&s;i&s;tible claims that Olivia, her father, and both the families had upon him;&mdash;&s;he ob&s;erved, that, though &s;trange impediments had combined to prevent him from an ear|lier explication, tho&s;e very impediments had given force to the preten&s;ions of Olivia, who, never &s;u&s;pecting any impediments had exi&s;tence, had been cheri&s;hing a pure affection all the while.&mdash;She gently up|braided Henry, for &s;uppo&s;ing that &s;he her|&s;elf would deign to become his wife, under the corroding con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having made <HI>any</HI> other woman, who had &s;o many &s;uperior
<PB N="164" REF="174">claims, unhappy,&mdash;but more e&s;pecially Oli|via Clare, the friend of her earlie&s;t youth.&mdash;"With re&s;pect to my&s;elf,"&mdash;cries Caroline,&mdash;"being in the con&s;tant habit of meeting ill fortune, I better know how to &s;truggle with it, in the &s;evere&s;t &s;hapes it can pre&s;ent it&s;elf:&mdash;and, alas! the power that puni&s;hes me, knows it is now about to take a form the mo&s;t dreadful!&mdash;perhaps&mdash;the mo&s;t in&s;up|portable."</P>
<P>Caroline's fortitude again for&s;ook her: and Henry, in the &s;truggle betwixt the contrary emotions of hope and fear, drew his chair, &s;o as to be within reach of her trembling hand, which he pre&s;&s;ed in his own,&mdash;but could not &s;peak.</P>
<P>"Yes! misfortune, my dear unhappy Henry," continued the firm but faultering caroline, "has, I hope, inured my heart to bear what would probably break that of Mi&s;s Clare, who has been bred up by every &s;mil|ing power, in the lap of indulgence,&mdash;the pride and joy of two re&s;pectable families,&mdash;and has perhaps never known any di&s;ap|pointment but what I have already occa|&s;ioned.
<PB N="165" REF="175">&mdash;Ah, Henry! how would &s;he hate your Caroline!&mdash;alas! yours, did I &s;ay?&mdash;how would &s;he contemn the cau&s;e of all the delays and my&s;teries which have involved her in one eternal maze, did &s;he know that Caroline Stuart had, like her evil genius, &s;o often robbed her of Henry's dear &s;ociety!&mdash;Yet, alas! this tran&s;ient plea&s;ure &s;hould not be envied me!&mdash;for oh, what vengeance fol|lows it! Indeed, Henry, I can &s;carcely bear the thought:&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;it mu&s;t be borne: and, whatever happens to me, I will endure that, or any other misfortune it may be the will of Providence to inflict, rather than the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of carrying grief, di&s;tre&s;s, ha|tred, and, perhaps, death, into the hou&s;es&mdash; into the hearts of &s;o many per&s;ons!&mdash;Such an abhorred union, indeed, would now force, even upon you, Henry, a ju&s;t opinion of my unworthine&s;s.&mdash;And ought I not to be di&s;|plea&s;ed that you &s;hould believe I would take refuge in Olivia's <HI>mercy</HI> to me, when I had not &s;hewn any to her?&mdash;or, that Caro|line, bowed as &s;he is by many griefs, could be content to owe the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Henry's
<PB N="166" REF="176">hand to that bounty which would con&s;ign her&s;elf, her aged father, and Henry's parents, to wretchedne&s;s and de&s;pair?&mdash;Why, Hen|ry, &s;hould you &s;uppo&s;e, even Olivia could &s;urpa&s;s your Caroline in doing what is right,"&mdash;added &s;he, giving dignity to her before humbling di&s;tre&s;s,&mdash;"when Caroline has the advantage of the point of rectitude being fir&s;t &s;hewn her?&mdash;and, had you, Henry, carried on the concealment longer, and avail|ing your&s;elf of my unhappy partiality, made me, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, your wife&mdash;"&s;omething a&s;&s;ociated with the word <HI>wife</HI> fainted on her lips, as &s;he pronounced it; and many moments pa&s;t, ere &s;he could conclude the &s;entence&mdash;"and had I afterwards been proved the dire though innocent &s;courge of your family, how wretched &s;hould we both have been!&mdash;My di&s;gu&s;t&mdash;perhaps my hatred even of Henry Fitzorton&mdash;might have been the con&s;equence!"</P>
<P>"And will it not," &s;aid Henry, &s;tarting up with violence,&mdash;"will it not be far wor&s;e, to give my loathing hand to Olivia,&mdash;and the after-proof come out, that &s;he has
<PB N="167" REF="177">been the cau&s;e of all my mi&s;ery and yours?&mdash;and, though &s;he never can have my hate, &s;he never had my love, and would <HI>then</HI> be the bane of Henry's, of Caroline's, and or her own happine&s;s."</P>
<P>"No &s;uch proof," cries Caroline, more a&s;&s;uredly,&mdash;"need ever happen.&mdash;You are too good and generous, to treat any woman who &s;incerely loves you, unkindly;&mdash;and kind|ne&s;s from Henry Fitzorton, will be in the place of a warmer &s;entiment:&mdash;nay, it is, in him, a &s;entiment more tender than the love of an ordinary mind.&mdash;At all events, it is in your power to make Olivia Clare the hap|pie&s;t of women! &mdash; But Caroline Stuart, whom you have now acquainted with your &s;ituation, you could render even more wretched.&mdash;There remains nothing for her but accommodation to tho&s;e &s;evere trials in which, alas! her whole life has been pa&s;t. Oh! I blu&s;h not, though I weep, to &s;ay I would not yield up the pro&s;pect, which de|lu&s;ive hope recently &s;pread before me, on weak &s;urmi&s;es,&mdash;or let any vi&s;ionary clouds, that might gather to darken it, prevail.&mdash;
<PB N="168" REF="178">No!&mdash;I would embrace whatever might di&s;|pel the &s;urrounding darkne&s;s!&mdash;But, ca&s;t your eyes on every &s;ide; and you will &s;ee the fatal nece&s;&s;ity of taking our re&s;olu|tion."</P>
<P>"Hold!" exclaimed Henry:&mdash;"I &s;ee the point you aim at:&mdash;your re&s;olution would not affect the general peace, to which you would thus &s;acrifice your own happine&s;s and mine.&mdash;I warn you, that it would &s;ubvert it.&mdash;There is a cau&s;e &s;till behind."</P>
<P>"Alas! alas! there can be none," inter|rupted Caroline, &s;till bathed in tears:&mdash;"there can be no cau&s;e, why I &s;hould not here &s;olemnly bind my&s;elf by the mo&s;t ir|revocable vow never more to &s;ee Henry Fitzorton,&mdash;the pride, pleafure, and pa&s;|&s;ion of my &s;oul,&mdash;till&mdash;till he is the hu&s;band&mdash;of&mdash;of&mdash;"</P>
<P>The word <HI>hu&s;band</HI> had even a more pow|erful effect upon the whole frame of Caro|line, than that of wife, for the expre&s;&s;ion &s;unk her to the earth.</P>
<P>"The hu&s;band!&mdash;of whom?" exclaimed Henry:&mdash;"of Olivia Clare? Oh mon&s;trous!
<PB N="169" REF="179">mon&s;trous!&mdash;Oh God!"&mdash;exclaimed Henry, rai&s;ing the convul&s;ing form of Caroline into his arms,&mdash;"yes, this barbarous effect, even of the very <HI>thought,</HI> is a fre&s;h proof, deare&s;t life, that, were Henry Fitzorton the hu&s;|band of Olivia Clare, he would be the mo&s;t perjured traitor to love and friend&s;hip!&mdash;he would be the mo&s;t perfidious viper, to &s;ting and wound every brea&s;t mo&s;t dear;&mdash;and Ca|roline Stuart would become acce&s;&s;ary to all his fraud, to all his treachery,&mdash;Alas! my love," continued he, &s;till holding and &s;till care&s;&s;ing the unre&s;i&s;ting, the almo&s;t lifele&s;s Caroline,&mdash;"there is yet another fatal my&s;|tery to be explained."&mdash;"Re&s;erve it," &s;aid Caroline, faintly:&mdash;"I can hear&mdash;I can bear no more."&mdash;"Remember," &s;aid Hen|ry,&mdash;"remember that I bid you beware, as you would avoid the de&s;pair, the de&s;truction of all that is precious to your blood,&mdash;beware of coming to any re&s;olution which &s;hall preclude you from acting as your future duty may pre&s;cribe. Your brother can di&s;|clo&s;e the re&s;t."</P>
<P>Caroline had been &s;everal times waving
<PB N="170" REF="180">her hand, as a &s;ign for Henry's leaving her, a&s;&s;uring him, by &s;uch broken &s;entences as &s;he could utter, that he might depend on her doing what &s;he thought was right,&mdash;but that &s;he could not an&s;wer to what a degree her illne&s;s might augment, if he per&s;i&s;ted in the conver&s;ation any longer, till &s;he was more recovered. Henry, therefore, went mourn|fully but ha&s;tily out of the room, and by the greate&s;t good luck, or &s;omething that an|&s;wered his purpo&s;e ju&s;t as well, met Sir Gui&s;e gliding from an adjoining apartment. He appeared, however, &s;omewhat confu&s;ed and agitated,&mdash;perhaps at &s;eeing Henry unea&s;y. Few words, therefore, pa&s;&s;ed between them; and tho&s;e purported, on the part of Henry, a reque&s;t to defer the particulars of his di&s;|cour&s;e with Caroline, on account of her &s;ud|den indi&s;po&s;ition, till the next day, alleging, that, as his father was confined to his chamber, it would be expected he &s;hould &s;up at the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>With this requi&s;ition the worthy baronet readily complied,&mdash;expre&s;&s;ing le&s;s curio&s;ity than might have been expected. He there|fore
<PB N="171" REF="181">civilly demanded of Henry, whether he cho&s;e any of the &s;ervants to attend him; and, on his courte&s;y being as hand&s;omely de|clined, they parted.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXII.</HEAD>
<P>BUT our &s;ympathy of virtuous and &s;u|perior woe demands that we &s;hould leave Henry on the road to the ca&s;tle, and return to Caroline at the abbey. This truly amia|ble and as truly unhappy girl remained without words, and almo&s;t without &s;en&s;e, long after her lover's reluctant obedience to her repeated requi&s;ition. The fir&s;t thing which &s;truck her when &s;he felt her&s;elf &s;ome|what collected, was Olivia's miniature, which Henry had left on the table in his general agitation. Her examination of this led her to account for &s;everal of the my&s;terious ex|pre&s;&s;ions which fell from Henry towards the clo&s;e of his conver&s;ation; for, on his way to the abbey, Henry had penciled on the pa|per that had been the envelope of the pic|ture,
<PB N="172" REF="182">and which remained al&s;o on the table, "This &s;hall be a transfer to dear Charles." Thus, not only the words of her brother, which were once overheard and a&s;&s;erted to her by Denni&s;on, but tho&s;e which Charles him&s;elf dropt the &s;ame morning previous to his &s;etting out to join his regiment, were brought forcibly to her mind.</P>
<P>It was hence apparent that her brother loved Olivia; and not le&s;s evident that Olivia had fixed her entire affection upon Henry; and finally, that both Henry and Charles were, neverthele&s;s, in the &s;tricte&s;t friend&s;hip. But, although this di&s;covery deve|loped the maze one way, it involved in it an|other, beyond all her power to unravel; yet one inflexible truth pre&s;&s;ed on her in a more unrelenting &s;hape even than it had before,&mdash;that whether Henry and Olivia were or were not to be united, Henry and Caroline could never join; &s;ince, to &s;uppo&s;e that Olivia Clare would ever di&s;po&s;e of her hand to Charles, and that Henry would thereby be at liberty to offer him&s;elf to Caroline Stuart, were points equally prepo&s;terous.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="183">In this &s;tate of perplexity, her father en|tered the room; and although he was in &s;ome perturbation from a cau&s;e yet untold, he &s;aw his daughter's dejected countenance with parental regret, and ob&s;erved on it, that, as the occa&s;ion had in &s;ome mea&s;ure been related by Mr. Fitzorton, he would not give her the pain of again telling the &s;tory, but do every thing in his power to make her happy; &s;aying at the &s;ame time, &s;he mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, as well as Henry, how ready he had been to &s;acrifice him&s;elf to their felicity, though he could not take upon him to an&s;wer for events, and that he relied upon both her and Henry doing him every ju&s;tice with his &s;on Charles.</P>
<P>The deeply-afflicted Caroline acknow|ledged that his goodne&s;s was written in the tablets of her heart, and that &s;he was &s;ure Mr. Fitzorton and her brother would ever retain a due &s;en&s;e of it; then entreated her father's indulgence to retire for the night.</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e granted this petition al&s;o, as willingly as he had done the other, and after &s;aying he hoped a good night's re&s;t would
<PB N="174" REF="184">&s;et all right again, de&s;ired her to hope the be&s;t, called her his dear Caroline, and bade her adieu.</P>
<P>Since the burial of Lady Stuart, Caroline had &s;ucceeded to the chamber in which that amiable woman died; and this &s;ucce&s;&s;ion proceeded from the very oppo&s;ite &s;en&s;ation to that, which, had there not been any &s;e|paration of &s;leeping-rooms between Sir Gui&s;e and his wife, would have induced the good baronet to change it for another. Indeed he had moved to one at the other end of the abbey; but as this motive might have been &s;ugge&s;ted by the love which could not en|dure the &s;ight of the de&s;olated &s;pot which brings to memory the object of affection, no le&s;s than by the hate which &s;urvives the grave, or by the fear which always attends upon guilt, but more particularly when we view the place where our &s;elf-condemned crimes were committed, and of cour&s;e, where the con&s;equences of tho&s;e crimes might be faid to &s;tare us in the face, ina&s;much, as they &s;eem, to the "mind's eye," the gho&s;ts of our pa&s;t foul deeds,&mdash;it is but fair that we leave
<PB N="175" REF="185">the choice of the&s;e &s;everal motives to the reader's own &s;election.</P>
<P>Certain it is, that the night after the fu|neral&mdash;on the &s;ame night, the reader remem|bers, one or other of the above-&s;tated &s;enti|ments kept him out of <HI>any</HI> bed-chamber,&mdash;he did remove far from his from his decea&s;ed wife's apartment; and whatever were his motives, tho&s;e of his daughter, in giving that very chamber the preference to every other in the hou&s;e, proceeded from the &s;incere affec|tion which attaches it&s;elf to whatever brings to mind the venerated though departed ob|ject. Neverthele&s;s, we are ready to admit, the &s;ame mea&s;ure of affection that filled the bo&s;om and memory of Caroline, might be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by many other daughters, who might yet find them&s;elves unable to &s;upport the &s;ight of any thing their decea&s;ed parents had worn, touched, or been accu&s;tomed to behold:&mdash;and, indeed, we have known &s;ome of the mo&s;t amiable per&s;ons fly from their hou&s;es, their e&s;tates, and their coutry, on this principle; and, forbid it nature, that we &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed to ridicule <HI>any</HI> of the
<PB N="176" REF="186">pious terrors, or even the &s;uper&s;titions of filial love!&mdash;we only feel it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay,&mdash;as has indeed more than once been proved to the reader,&mdash;that the mind of Caroline Stuart, though melting as love it&s;elf, had none of the&s;e apprehen&s;ions. Yet the re|&s;ignation of her late apartment, which was al&s;o precious to her remembrance, was connected with &s;ome other circum&s;tances that ought not, as they are in keeping with her character, to be pa&s;&s;ed over.</P>
<P>We can &s;ometimes better endure the &s;ight of that room where we have &s;een a dear parent expiring, than of that where we &s;up|po&s;e our&s;elves to have taken an eternal leave of a living lover. When Caroline, at her father's command, had bade, as &s;he thought it to be, an everla&s;ting adieu to Henry, &s;he gave vent to all the tender effu&s;ions which are &s;et down for thy &s;ympathy, reader, in a former part of this work; but this little &s;pot, late &s;o dear to her, &s;oon became an object of e&s;cape, becau&s;e &s;he found it more difficult for her to perform the &s;evere ta&s;k of oblite|rating Henry from her mind, while from the
<PB N="177" REF="187">window of that apartment &s;he looked upon many things that brought his image back too keenly upon her &s;en&s;e; and, although, in her mother's room, when &s;he was devoid of all the powers of recollection, Henry had &s;up|ported her in his arms, her reflections there|upon were more divided than from the view of that window.&mdash;Has the reader forgotten, that it had in full pro&s;pect the grand avenue, of tender memory, the &s;pot where the loves of Henry and Caroline were <HI>fir&s;t declared</HI> to each other, and, alas! <HI>di&s;covered</HI> to Sir Gui&s;e? And, to clo&s;e the whole artillery which it levelled again&s;t her lacerated heart, has it e&s;caped his memory, that it carried the eye to the mo&s;t appreciated part of Fitzor|ton-ca&s;tle, even to the chamber of Henry him&s;elf?</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, therefore, to avoid, as much as in her lay, the objects which fed her de&s;pair, &s;he tore her&s;elf from the&s;e temptations, and took refuge in a place where perhaps her grief from one cau&s;e was mitigated by the claims from another; for it is certain that two &s;orrows equally great, provided they are
<PB N="178" REF="188">of di&s;tinct kinds, demand that divi&s;ion of our thoughts, and afford that &s;ad relief, which, in any &s;ingle calamity, often overwhelms the &s;ufferer.</P>
<P>Her mother's vacated room, then, &s;he for &s;ome time occupied; but &s;ince her father's turn of behaviour, &s;he con&s;idered the pro|&s;pect from her old apartment as both lite|rally and figuratively clearing up, and had therefore moved into it again. But now that it was overca&s;t by another cloud more dark and menacing than any of the former, &s;he &s;ettled the plan of a third alteration even as &s;he was a&s;cending the &s;tairs,&mdash;&s;ent her woman for her night-dre&s;s,&mdash;and direct|ed her &s;teps once more to the room of Lady Stuart.</P>
<P>All that was heroic about Caroline was &s;ubdued. She had not only exerted, but exhau&s;ted, whatever the natural &s;trength or acquired energy of her mind could &s;upply, to &s;upport her in the la&s;t di&s;cour&s;e &s;he had held with Henry; and from the weari|ne&s;s of a &s;oul more hara&s;&s;ed than the frame that enclo&s;ed it, &s;he had &s;carcely gained her
<PB N="179" REF="189">mother's room ere an extreme faintne&s;s overtook her, and &s;he fell down in a &s;woon, in which, without any violence,&mdash;indeed, &s;carcely without any &s;ound, or motion,&mdash;&s;he remained till the maid whom &s;he had &s;ent into the other chamber came to re&s;tore her,&mdash;or, more properly &s;peaking, till per&s;ecuted nature by a temporary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of life re|&s;tored her&s;elf.</P>
<P>But, with the powers of her life, the &s;en&s;e of that happine&s;s which would have made life de&s;irable, was not, alas! renewed. On the contrary, &s;he revived to the mo&s;t ago|nizing reflections. Her pre&s;ent appeared le&s;s to be endured than her former fate. To that, if &s;he had not been reconciled, &s;he had in &s;ome mea&s;ure been re&s;igned. She had impo&s;ed on her&s;elf the &s;evere but nece&s;&s;ary ta&s;k of calling to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance whatever would be mo&s;t likely to keep her heart under &s;ome di&s;cipline; though &s;he found it im|po&s;&s;ible to vanqui&s;h the ho&s;t of tender but powerful enemies that had there gained re|&s;idence: the&s;e, however, rea&s;on, duty, and time, three of the mo&s;t able and experienced
<PB N="180" REF="190">generals, and on whom &s;he wholly relied for &s;ucce&s;s, might at length have routed. But, when the en&s;lavers were almo&s;t wor&s;ted,&mdash;when Love him&s;elf, after many de&s;perate &s;kirmi&s;hes, and &s;ome pitched battles, with the forementioned chiefs, was made a cap|tive, and led out of his citadel in Caroline's brea&s;t, in chains,&mdash;<HI>then</HI> to have rea&s;on and duty not only demand a truce, but throw|ing down their arms, and, as of old, in the &s;tory of the Horatii, run into the embraces of the oppo&s;ite party, declaring that the war was unnatural;&mdash;after &s;uch a treaty, approved of by duty, and, indeed, &s;igned and &s;ealed by that aweful power,&mdash;nay, after both the armies, formed by the&s;e potentates, were di&s;banded, a cho&s;en few only keeping gar|ri&s;on at the abbey, to prevent &s;urpri&s;e from the ca&s;tle, where, it was imagined, &s;ome malcontents, not yet brought over, were po&s;ted,&mdash;<HI>then,</HI> we &s;ay, to have the amicable convention broken by an enemy from the mo&s;t unexpected quarter,&mdash;even in the gen|tle Olivia Clare,&mdash;who, without her&s;elf be|ing as yet con&s;cious of it, involved the
<PB N="181" REF="191">hou&s;es of Fitzorton and Stuart in deadlier hate than that which the daughter of king Priam occa&s;ioned;&mdash;this&mdash;this was indeed too much!</P>
<P>Such, however, was the ca&s;e.&mdash;Ho&s;tili|ties recommenced:&mdash;every pa&s;&s;ion and eve|ry principle mu&s;tered their forces,&mdash;&s;ounded to arms,&mdash;and duty, compa&s;&s;ion, rea&s;on, and <HI>rival</HI> love, were all at once warring in Ca|roline's bo&s;om.</P>

<P>WHEN this amiable but unfortunate girl was left, at her &s;trong de&s;ire, alone, &s;he ca&s;t a mournful look over the apartment, and derived &s;ome little comfort from re|flecting that her dear mother, who breathed her la&s;t in it, was now in her peaceful tomb.&mdash;"That is &s;ome comfort yet!" &s;aid &s;he:&mdash;"it is the cordial drop thrown into the bitter cup of my de&s;pair!"</P>
<P>Taking from her pocket that handker|chief of which her eyes but too much &s;tood in need,&mdash;&s;he felt the little pacquet that

<P>It is not an ea&s;y matter to de&s;cribe the mixed &s;en&s;ations that took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Ca|roline as &s;he attentively looked on this picture:&mdash;how di&s;tinct from tho&s;e &s;he felt on receiving that of Lady Stuart, and the two others, from the hands of her dying mother!&mdash;At Olivia's &s;he looked, and to
<PB N="183" REF="193">Olivia &s;he &s;pake, as if it were the original&mdash;"Beautiful author of the mi&s;ery which awaits us all," &s;aid &s;he,&mdash;"dear play-mate, when life was young,&mdash;wherefore are we rivals?&mdash;Yet, how was it to be avoided?&mdash;how could it be po&s;&s;ible for thee to live in the pre&s;ence of my Henry&mdash;of <HI>thy</HI> Henry, and his thou&s;and virtues, and not give him all thy heart, even, alas! as I gave him mine?&mdash;And what but that pride which mu&s;t now be &s;everely humiliated, could &s;o long blind me to the certainty of this?&mdash;But how is it that his own has e&s;caped the magic of thy merit and thy charms?&mdash;how has it been po&s;&s;ible for him not to return thy pa&s;&s;ion?&mdash;Yet love is capricious; el&s;e had thy empire been unque&s;tioned.&mdash;Ah! had&s;t thou honoured my dear unhappy brother with thy affec|tion, &mdash;for now I &s;ee into the &s;ource of his long concealed di&s;tre&s;s!&mdash;Yet, thou art not my rival, but my a&s;&s;ociate in grief.&mdash;Even the irreparable lo&s;s which Caroline mu&s;t &s;u&s;tain, will be no gain to thee, Olivia!&mdash;We mu&s;t both be wretched&mdash;wretched in the extreme!"</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="194">The breath of her &s;ighs had dimmed the cry&s;tal of the miniature: but her tears fall|ing fa&s;t upon it at the &s;ame time,&mdash;"Hea|ven knows," continued &s;he,&mdash;"I would not willingly ob&s;cure thy &s;ight or happine&s;s; nor would&s;t thou mine!&mdash;Ah! that we could relieve the misfortunes which I fore&s;ee are in &s;tore for us both!&mdash;for indeed, Olivia, to thy painted image I may, without fear of wounding thee, confe&s;s, Henry Fitzorton cannot be more dear to thee, than he was&mdash;than he is&mdash;and, I fear, ever, ever mu&s;t be to&mdash;"</P>
<P>She pre&s;&s;ed the miniature to her bo&s;om, without fini&s;hing the &s;entence.&mdash;"Yet," re&s;umed &s;he,&mdash;"in this confe&s;&s;ion I do not wrong thee,&mdash;I do not wrong thee, Olivia;&mdash;for I have lo&s;t him for ever!&mdash;He is gone from me, never, never to return!&mdash;And were he thine this moment, or divided from thee, even as he is from Caroline,&mdash;&s;uch is the &s;evere de&s;tiny in which we are both en|tangled, we mu&s;t be both mi&s;erable."</P>
<P>In the &s;truggle of the&s;e emotions, &s;he had turned the miniature on the other &s;ide,
<PB N="185" REF="195">which pre&s;ented &s;everal little devices, done with Olivia's hair, &s;uch as Cupid and Hy|men binding Venus with her own ce&s;tus;&mdash;and, underneath, a motto in pearls, &s;uitable to the de&s;ign;&mdash;on &s;eeing which, &s;he uttered many more &s;entiments expre&s;&s;ive of her feel|ings; in the cour&s;e of which, &s;he adverted, for the fir&s;t time &s;ince the death of her mo|ther, to the circum&s;tance of her own and brother's miniatures, which &s;he knew had been in Lady Stuart's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and not &s;poken of at the time when &s;he received the other, on the very bed which was now &s;pread before her.&mdash;Thinking, however, they were depo&s;ited in &s;ome of her mother's drawers, into which &s;he had not yet exa|mined, all thoughts re&s;pecting them &s;oon &s;ub&s;ided.&mdash;That of her mother, however, &s;he drew from her bo&s;om, which had been its "mo&s;t delicate lodging" ever &s;ince, and ki&s;&s;ed it fervently,&mdash;then returning it to its tender but now trembling throne, &s;he re|&s;umed her attentions to Henry and Olivia, who appeared by turns to occupy, her en|tire
<PB N="186" REF="196">&s;oul.&mdash;It is beyond que&s;tion, that her affection for the one, notwith&s;tanding all increa&s;e of mi&s;ery and impediment, was now at its height;&mdash;and her pity for the other, derived, perhaps, partly from fellow-feeling, was no le&s;s extreme.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e of her father's unwonted kind|ne&s;s, the &s;incerity of which was not for one moment doubted, relieved her much;&mdash;&s;he thought it far better that her &s;orrows &s;hould flow from any but the <HI>dome&s;tic</HI> foun|tain, who&s;e waters of &s;trife indeed are the mo&s;t bitter we can po&s;&s;ibly ta&s;te.&mdash;"Ble&s;&s;ed be God! it is not my father's fault now," cried &s;he, "that I am relap&s;ed into my former wretchedne&s;s, with every aggravation that could be heaped upon it. He, alas!&mdash;which is, indeed, one of tho&s;e aggravations,&mdash;partakes my grief, after he had generou&s;ly &s;acrificed to me his &s;tronge&s;t re&s;entments, and taken my deare&s;t Henry to his arms."</P>
<P>She then adverted to her brother,&mdash;and again taking up Olivia's picture, &s;he ex|claimed,
<PB N="187" REF="197">in a &s;oftly rebuking tone,&mdash;"And thou al&s;o art the unhappy cau&s;e of my dear Charles's affliction,&mdash;a youth &s;carce le&s;s de&s;erv|ing thy adoration than Henry him&s;elf!&mdash;But for his love of thee, O in&s;en&s;ible! he, at lea&s;t, might have been happy; and in this dread hour of my own woe, I might have looked up to him for comfort, courage, and pity.&mdash; He will now, alas! be ab&s;orbed by his own griefs."</P>
<P>She had no &s;ooner uttered the&s;e re|proaches again&s;t Olivia, than &s;he turned &s;everal of a more bitter kind, and with as little rea&s;on, again&s;t her&s;elf, whom &s;he ac|cu&s;ed of cruelty, folly, fal&s;ehood, and mad|ne&s;s, &mdash;recapitulating the &s;everal cau&s;es of impediment, why neither Charles and Olivia, nor Henry and Caroline, could ever hope, even had their own hearts &s;o arranged mat|ters, to be united by holy vows.&mdash;She next pre&s;&s;ed the miniature to her lips, and be|&s;towed on it a ki&s;s, in token of her reconci|liation and repentance.&mdash;In &s;hort, &s;he proved in every reflection, &s;he was in love, and in de&s;pair:&mdash;&s;he proved, indeed, at once,

<P><PB N="190" REF="200">"No, truly," &s;aid Caroline, &s;obbing with &s;tifled emotions:&mdash;"It is not his."</P>
<P>"Not his!" returned Charles:&mdash;"&s;urely nothing can have happened between you, to make him return your own!"</P>
<P>"My own?" exclaimed Caroline.&mdash;"Yes, Caroline," &s;aid Charles:&mdash;"I found yours with mine, on that very bed &s;oon after our ever-lamented mother had expired, and gave him both with the benediction of her dying breath, &s;till warm upon them.&mdash;He was entitled to the gifts: for, now that &s;aint is in heaven, who upon earth can love Caro|line and Charles, like Henry Fitzorton?&mdash;I will not think any thing could induce him to give it back:&mdash;let me &s;ee!&mdash;perhaps he has pre&s;ented you with mine:&mdash;but could that make you weep?"</P>
<P>"It <HI>is</HI> yours, Charles," &s;aid Caroline,&mdash;"and left with me in tru&s;t, to pre&s;ent to you the moment I &s;hould &s;ee you."</P>
<P>Caroline gave the miniature to her bro|ther, who, on the fir&s;t view, exclaimed&mdash;"Gracious heaven! what do I &s;ee, my
<PB N="191" REF="201">dear Olivia?&mdash;Tell me, &s;i&s;ter, I conjure you,&mdash;tell me, have our happy de&s;tinies been &s;o run together, that while&mdash;heaven knows how di&s;intere&s;tedly&mdash;I have been labouring for the felicity of Henry and Caroline,&mdash;they, by &s;ome yet unknown good fortune, have been promoting the happine&s;s of Charles and Olivia?&mdash;Oh! if I could flatter my heart that this dear, dear re&s;emblance of all which is mo&s;t precious, was given by the loved original, to be pre&s;ented by Henry to Caroline, and by her to Charles!&mdash;but that is impo&s;&s;ible:&mdash;I rave!&mdash;alas! it is no won|der! &mdash;I love:&mdash;forgive! pity me!"</P>
<P>Here, in&s;tead of ending his rhap&s;ody, he fell to ki&s;s and care&s;s the miniature,&mdash;eja|culating as he gazed, "Is &s;he not an angel, Caroline?&mdash;did you ever behold &s;uch a brow?&mdash;&s;uch an eye?&mdash;&s;uch a lip?&mdash;&s;he certainly in&s;pired the arti&s;t! who is he?&mdash;I could wor&s;hip him!&mdash;why do you not &s;peak?&mdash;Oh my foreboding heart! you are weep|ing &s;till!"</P>
<P>Caroline felt the utmo&s;t regret at the &s;ad nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;&s;olving the charm that bound
<PB N="192" REF="202">up her brother's &s;en&s;es, or rather at re&s;tor|ing him to &s;en&s;e, out of that &s;weet deliri|um that carried him beyond the bounds of rea&s;on, into that delicious phrenzy, which, to &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions, in &s;uch &s;ituations, af|fords bli&s;s &s;uperior perhaps to what rea&s;on ever gave.&mdash;Finding, however, that he was &s;till impatient,&mdash;nay, that he &s;tampt and raved for explanation,&mdash;&s;he at length reluc|tantly cried,&mdash;"Alas!

<P>"<HI>His</HI> wife!" reiterated Charles.&mdash;"Friend|&s;hip forbid!&mdash;Should I live to &s;ee that day!&mdash; but I conjure you to tell me all:&mdash;if the hap|pine&s;s&mdash;the life of your brother be matter of concern, conceal not a tittle of what I per|ceive is now labouring in your bo&s;om.&mdash;The &s;udden &s;ight of this miniature has in|deed hurried me to a &s;weet oblivion of all my cares;&mdash;but I now return to the cur&s;e of

<P>The wild and extravagant manner in which he &s;poke, terrified Caroline;&mdash;but looking at him with a &s;oftne&s;s that might have extracted the &s;ting almo&s;t from de&s;pair it&s;elf,&mdash;"Alas! my brother," &s;aid &s;he, "could my life procure to you and your friend Henry the bli&s;s you have lo&s;t, it &s;hould be laid at your feet!"&mdash;She then explained all that had happened in the conver&s;ation be|twixt her and Henry: and when &s;he had brought down her narrative to the depo&s;it of the miniature, &s;he ob&s;erved, that &s;he referred, for the particulars re&s;pecting Olivia and Charles, to Charles him&s;elf.&mdash;
<PB N="194" REF="204">"Our dear father, however," &s;aid Caroline, "de&s;erves our warme&s;t acknowledgements on this occa&s;ion:&mdash;he has &s;hewn &s;uch indul|gence, that my grateful &s;oul avows he has made ample reparation for all former mi&s;|takes;&mdash;nay, I feel a&s;&s;ured, that, as much as in him lies,&mdash;oh! that his power were now equal to his generous inclinations!&mdash;he will promote the loves of Charles and Olivia.

<P>"O Caroline!" replied Charles,&mdash;"if I have hitherto concealed from you the &s;ecrets and the &s;orrows of my heart, it was from the &s;ame generous motives that actuated my be|loved friend to keep them from you."&mdash;He then related at length the &s;tory of his un|fortunate attachment, &mdash; the friendly be|haviour of Henry,&mdash;and the noble conduct of John Fitzorton. &mdash; He enlarged upon the cruel kindne&s;s of the whole family to

<PB N="196" REF="206">have at &s;take!&mdash;it is an awful cri&s;is!&mdash;if there is not any expedient to &s;ave us from irremediable de&s;pair, what mu&s;t be the re|&s;ult?&mdash;Oh Caroline! for the &s;ake of pity, friend&s;hip, love, &s;ugge&s;t &s;omething:&mdash;my brain &s;eems turning as I &s;peak to you.&mdash;My &s;i&s;ter and my friend alone are in the confi|dence of my affliction!&mdash;it involves them|&s;elves!&mdash;it will &s;pread to all who belong to us!&mdash;Caroline, weigh the matter well:&mdash;I am di&s;tracted."</P>
<P>He broke from her, and hurried down &s;tairs, leaving his &s;i&s;ter more perplexed than ever: for &s;he perceived too plainly, by her brother's vehemence in the relation, that the de&s;igns at the ca&s;tle were almo&s;t ripe for that event which would determine the de|&s;tiny of all whom it concerned:&mdash;the mini|ature of Olivia had wrought him to a curio&s;ity, who&s;e gratification had proved wor&s;e than the my&s;tery of his &s;i&s;ter's di&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;In &s;hort, &s;he perceived, that Charles had been long as violently in love with Olivia, as Henry could po&s;&s;ibly be with her&s;elf:&mdash;but with this &s;trong and unfortunate differ|ence
<PB N="197" REF="207">in the returns of the pa&s;&s;ion,&mdash;that Olivia was not &s;en&s;ible to, indeed was not con&s;cious of, the tenderne&s;s of Charles;&mdash;whereas Caroline felt in the bottom of her tyrannized heart, in de&s;pite of her di&s;ap|pointment and de&s;pair,&mdash;that it beat only for Henry.</P>
<P>It was no le&s;s apparent to her, that her brother and her Henry had been generou&s;ly, but unavailingly, playing into each other;s hands, to pro&s;per their affection by impart|ing favourable impre&s;&s;ions of each other to the beloved object;&mdash;and that, although the intere&s;t of Charles, was not, thereby, in any mea&s;ure advanced, Henry had not acted with le&s;s zeal, con&s;i&s;tent with the caution it was thought right to ob&s;erve, than Charles; in fine, that the friend&s;hip of the&s;e young men was equally noble, generous, and indefa|tigable.</P>

<P>THE vigilant Sir Gui&s;e, like a kind parent who has rea&s;on to fear his children were unhappy, was upon the &s;tairs to re|ceive his beloved &s;on when he came from Caroline's apartment;mdash;&s;olemnly prote&s;t|ing, the &s;upreme delight of his life would be to &s;ee his offspring as happy as their own wi&s;hes could make them,&mdash;which was an exact compromi&s;e betwixt &s;incerity and deceit; for in the ca&s;e of Charles it was true, and in that of Caroline it was fal&s;e.&mdash;In fact, he was in &s;ome &s;ort alienated from the former, by the almo&s;t con&s;tant up|braidings he received, on the double &s;cores of his tyranny and cowardice.&mdash;Charles, however, &s;till retained much of his invo|luntary affection:&mdash;and if any thing in the world, except the mi&s;carriage of cer|tain great de&s;igns which had been long rolling in his mind, could have broken down the bulwark of that impenetrable
<PB N="199" REF="209">&s;tuff of which his heart was compo&s;ed, it would perhaps have been the total lo&s;s of his &s;on's &s;ociety, &s;o often threatened.</P>
<P>"It is needle&s;s, my dear Charles," &s;aid this affectionate father,&mdash;"to give you the pain of repeating your di&s;cour&s;e with Caroline:&mdash;I have heard too much already for my peace, and I &s;ee you are much affected.&mdash;This letter, indeed," added Sir Gui&s;e, "is, of it&s;elf, a hi&s;tory of the plans carrying on at the ca&s;tle:&mdash;but do not read it at pre&s;ent: to|morrow morning you will be more able to take mea&s;ures in behalf of your poor &s;i&s;ter, and counteract their &s;tratagems."</P>
<P>Charles received the letter; and &s;ee|ing it had been written by Sir Armine,&mdash; indeed it was that brought to the abbey for Henry, and left there in his confu&s;ion,&mdash;"I mu&s;t read it, Sir," &s;aid Charles, "though every &s;entence were a poignard, and my life-blood &s;hould flow from the wounds."&mdash;He peru&s;ed the fatal epi&s;tle which had al|ready been the cau&s;e of &s;o much di&s;tre&s;s: and when he came to the pa&s;&s;ages, that men|tioned
<PB N="200" REF="210">the &s;tate of the preparation for Oli|via's marriage, he bur&s;t forth into the mo&s;t extravagant ge&s;tures and expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>"Have you come to that part," &s;aid Sir Gui&s;e, "where Fitzorton in&s;olently talks of the di&s;grace and <HI>infamy</HI> of an alliance with our family?"</P>
<P>Charles replied to this que&s;tion, only by a wild, in&s;en&s;ible kind of &s;tare.</P>
<P>"And did you take notice, my dear boy, of the &s;aucy air which the proud-hearted John gives him&s;elf,&mdash;in&s;inuating, than an union with the Stuarts would be pollution?"</P>
<P>"O Sir! breathe not an accent again&s;t John Fitzorton,"&mdash;an&s;wered Charles, reco|vering him&s;elf.&mdash;"He is the &s;econd young man in the world; and his brother, my friend Henry, is the fir&s;t;&mdash;my obligations to both are infinite; and I love Henry next to&mdash;but, perdition! if he marries her!&mdash;it mu&s;t not be!&mdash;I will &s;ooner put an end to both their lives,&mdash;to my own!"</P>
<P>Charles cru&s;hed the paper between his hands,&mdash;then opened and read it again.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="211">His father began to fear he had carried this exploit too far:&mdash;he &s;aw with terror the&s;e violences increa&s;e,&mdash;and did not know how &s;oon they might be turned upon him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>"What is this I &s;ee?"&mdash;que&s;tioned Charles, taking a light to read the pa&s;&s;age more clearly.&mdash;"Who is this?&mdash;Jane Atwood!"</P>
<P>"Jane Atwood!"&mdash;reiterated Sir Gui&s;e, who,&mdash;in his eagerne&s;s to &s;hew his &s;on, doubtle&s;s for &s;ome good rea&s;on, this letter,&mdash;had forgot what he would at pre&s;ent have concealed:&mdash;but after the confu&s;ion of a moment, he exclaimed with admirable pre|&s;ence of mind,&mdash;"Yes, they have, I un|der&s;tand, hunted up that infamous hu&s;&s;y, in order to fortify them&s;elves with fre&s;h malice, and do me fre&s;h mi&s;chief in the coun|try.&mdash;Think, Charles, what I am ready to do for the happine&s;s of you and your &s;i&s;ter, when I am willing to pa&s;s over even this mean in&s;ult!&mdash;his low paltry revenge!&mdash;Jenny Atwood, you know, is the girl, who I told you, ran away from her pari&s;h with child, and then put it round the country
<PB N="202" REF="212">for&s;ooth, that I was the father of the brat.&mdash;You remember the impudent &s;tory, I dare &s;ay: but heaven knows, I forgive them all:&mdash;nay, my dear &s;on &s;hall even carry my ad|vances to them, for the &s;ake of my chil|dren's happine&s;s;&mdash;and, indeed, for that of my own, I will meet my bittere&s;t enemies on the road of reconciliation, more than half way:&mdash;as to Jenny Atwood, old Fitzorton, and the furious Mr. John, I will,&mdash;I ought,&mdash;I am at peace with them all."</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e now &s;trung together, and &s;trewed around his pious harangue, many an holy text from &s;acred, and many a moral axiom from profane hi&s;tory,&mdash;ending with this a&s;&s;everation:&mdash;"Yes, Charles, I repeat, I forgive them all."</P>
<P>Whether his beloved &s;on was &s;ufficiently collected to hear any part of the foregoing &s;peech, or was a &s;ceptic as to its &s;incerity, is uncertain:&mdash;he only replied to the pa&s;|&s;age that had reference to Jenny Atwood;&mdash;and to that he &s;aid with &s;ome difficul|ty, but with a marked, though ob&s;truct|ed empha&s;is,&mdash;"As to the poor girl, by
<PB N="203" REF="213">whatever means &s;he found her way to the ca&s;tle, Sir, I am &s;ure &s;he will <HI>there</HI> find tho&s;e who will pity and protect her."</P>
<P>"Then you did not expect this marriage would take place quite &s;o &s;oon,"&mdash;interrupted the Baronet, willing to &s;hift the di&s;cour&s;e.&mdash;"I &s;hould not wonder if they were to hurry Henry into it &s;o &s;oon as to-morrow,&mdash;e&s;pe|cially if they &s;hould, any how, hear what confu&s;ion <HI>we</HI> are in about it."</P>
<P>"To-morrow!"&mdash;raved Charles,&mdash;"What! Henry and Olivia!&mdash;marry! to-morrow!&mdash;does this accur&s;ed, this murderous letter &s;ay &s;o?&mdash;Have you heard&mdash;did Henry dare to intimate&mdash;'Tis well I am come thus oppor|tunely for the ceremony!&mdash;I will be there!&mdash;yes! depend upon it, I will be there to-morrow!&mdash;damnation!"</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e felt him&s;elf now in a wor&s;e &s;crape than ever, and wi&s;hed he had let the conver|&s;ation take its cour&s;e even about Jenny At|wood.&mdash;Charles tore one of the &s;heets of the letter with a vehemence bordering on phrenzy,&mdash;put part of the fragments into his mouth, and champed them between his teeth.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="214">The affrighted Denni&s;on came in, &s;aying, his poor young lady had, in a great fright, rung to know what was the matter, and whether her pre&s;ence could be u&s;eful?&mdash;Charles ro&s;e,&mdash;&s;hook the old man by the hand,&mdash;begged him to entreat his &s;i&s;ter's for|givene&s;s for &s;uch un&s;ea&s;onable di&s;turbances; and that if &s;he would try her&s;elf to get a lit|tle re&s;t, he would withdraw to his chamber, and not utter another complaining &s;yllable, though his poor heart &s;hould bur&s;t in his bo&s;om. "Bear this me&s;&s;age to her, good fellow," &s;aid Charles; "and tell her you &s;aw me going to perform my promi&s;e:&mdash;but let me be called early." Then taking a candle, and bidding Sir Gui&s;e re&s;pectfully a good night, he went into his bed-room without thinking of any refre&s;hments after the fatigues of his journey, or the greater wearine&s;s of contending pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Denni&s;on &s;hook his head, as he went at full trot upon his commi&s;&s;ion, ob&s;erving as he a&s;cended the &s;tairs,&mdash;there mu&s;t be a place of comfort, bye and bye, &s;eeing that here upon earth there was none,&mdash;that high
<PB N="205" REF="215">and low, rich and poor, can get no re&s;t in this world for the &s;oles of their feet,&mdash;and &s;eeing, be&s;ides, that if this had been intended as a place of happine&s;s, his young ma&s;ter, and mi&s;tre&s;s, and &s;quire Henry, would be as merry as their days were long.</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e Stuart's morality was all in &s;o|liloquy, for he immediately went to bed, though we have our rea&s;ons for thinking, not to &s;leep.</P>
<P>Peradventure, courteous reader, thou art di&s;po&s;ed to retire into thy chamber al&s;o. Torpid, indeed, mu&s;t have been thy di&s;po&s;i|tion, if it has permitted thee to nod while the foregoing &s;cenes were repre&s;enting.

<P>IT has been intimated that the worthy baronet had heard, or rather overheard, the preceding conver&s;ation betwixt his &s;on and daughter. In truth, it is very certain, he knew every &s;yllable of their di&s;cour&s;e, as well as if he had been pre&s;ent the whole time. Indeed tho&s;e parts of him, be&s;t adapted to take in the intelligence were, in a manner, pre&s;ent; for, though he could not, in &s;trict|ne&s;s of &s;peaking, be &s;aid to be an eye, he had been an ear, witne&s;s, and could have &s;worn to the facts, on auricular demon&s;tra|tion, in any court of judicature, as con&s;cien|tiou&s;ly as if he had been a &s;pectator. The worthy baronet con&s;tantly put him&s;elf in the way of enjoying all the benefits of this mode of collecting evidence; and as to hearing now and then &s;uch a character of
<PB N="207" REF="217">him&s;elf as he knew he de&s;erved,&mdash;in drawing which, his &s;ervants, or others, would liberally deal forth the words&mdash;'profligate&mdash;villain&mdash;coward,' &amp;c. he treated the&s;e things as mere matters of cour&s;e, which were no more able to reach his con&s;cience, at lea&s;t to <HI>wound</HI> it, than the paper pellet of a pop-gun from a &s;choolboy's arm could penetrate the anvil which had &s;tood the heat and hammer of a century in a black&s;mith's &s;hop.</P>
<P>By the&s;e laudable means, he knew every body's FAMILY SECRETS, without any ha|zard of divulging his own,&mdash;which is fre|quently an unwelcome interruption to the bu&s;ine&s;s in hand, perplexing it with adventi|tious matter. Sometimes, it mu&s;t be owned, the li&s;tener, who is ju&s;tly &s;aid &s;eldom to hear much good of him&s;elf, is a little put to it to maintain his po&s;t, which the baronet, like the poet,&mdash;leaving out only the expletive word "honour"&mdash;found, was "a private &s;tation."</P>

<P>THE meditations of Henry Fitzorton on his &s;econd expul&s;ion from the abbey, and partly by that very clearing up of affairs &s;o long dreaded, and de&s;ired, were not more enviable than tho&s;e of Caroline. His night &s;cenes, indeed, from this place, were gene|rally gloomy enough; and &s;ome evil planet &s;eemed to rule his de&s;tiny whenever he pa&s;&s;ed along the famous grand avenue, by which he now again &s;ought the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>His old habit of holding conver&s;ations with him&s;elf returned &s;trongly upon him, as he reached the pathway at which the fir&s;t fatal declaration of his love for Caroline took place. "Since that moment," cried he, "ah! what has been my life, but a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of my&s;teries and misfortunes? I am driven from the ca&s;tle to the abbey, and again from the abbey to the ca&s;tle, only to be made more and more the &s;port of my ma|licious &s;tars! If a gleam of hope breaks
<PB N="209" REF="219">upon me from Caroline, it is in&s;tantly cloud|ed by Olivia! If I labour to teach my heart to &s;acrifice it&s;elf to the latter, the former &s;eems to pronounce, that my peace and my vows are broken for ever! Here the mi|&s;ery of my bo&s;om friend! and there the de|&s;olation of my own family! Even the ap|probation of Sir Gui&s;e, which I thought a ble&s;&s;ing beyond my reach, is no &s;ooner ob|tained, than another impediment &s;tarts up to render that ble&s;&s;ing of no avail! I have left tho&s;e con&s;ecrated walls again in de&s;pair; and what awaits me at the place to which I am directing my &s;teps? If I unravel the like my&s;terious cau&s;es there, the like effects mu&s;t en&s;ue,&mdash;the tears of Olivia! and the wrath of my dear&mdash;dear&mdash;father! If I re|main &s;ilent, which I have already done but too long, that &s;ilence will be again ad|duced in proof of my con&s;ent to their di&s;|po&s;al of my revolting heart!"</P>
<P>All this time True George was within a few paces of Henry, but &s;aid not a word: when|ever his ma&s;ter turned, or made any tran&s;|ver&s;e motions, the faithful &s;ervant, who had
<PB N="210" REF="220">the legs of a hare though he had not the wings of a bird, was on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide in a moment: his cu&s;tom, when there hap|pened, as in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, to be any trees or hedges, was to keep as near to them as po&s;&s;ible; and in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, he was in, over, or under them in the twinkling of an eye.</P>
<P>In truth, this hone&s;t fellow, independent on the veneration he bare to Henry for his book-learning, and e&s;pecially for his quota|tions from the poets, had long &s;u&s;pected, and for &s;ome time pa&s;t looked upon him, to be ab&s;olutely mad; and from the various &s;olilo|quies he had overheard, in which the name of Caroline was &s;o often mentioned, he had &s;et it down that this injury on his poor ma|&s;ter's brain had been occa&s;ioned by his being cro&s;&s;ed in love. But his &s;en&s;e of honour was naturally too great to breathe the di&s;co|very which he thought he had made, to any &s;econd per&s;on upon earth; and his fear of offending, and indeed, of making his ma&s;ter wor&s;e, had, in like manner, re&s;trained him from &s;peaking of it to Henry him&s;elf. In
<PB N="211" REF="221">the day-time, George was pretty ea&s;y, think|ing Henry &s;ufficiently &s;afe in the &s;ociety of his friends or relations: but, from the very in&s;tant that the evening drew in, he was as a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly upon guard, as if it was his turn to hold watch on the toll of the curfew; and he attended his ma&s;ter's motions, from night|fall even until bed-time, making it a con|&s;tant rule not to leave him till he was or|dered to take away his light.</P>
<P>This general a&s;&s;iduity had not a little endeared him to Henry, who&s;e gratitude for every degree of kindne&s;s &s;hewn to him, whatever was the rank or &s;tation of the obliging per&s;on, was lively and &s;incere. Hi|therto, however, George's nocturnal attend|ance had e&s;caped the di&s;covery of his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The dexterity and management with which the poor fellow kept &s;entry upon Henry, is curious.&mdash;If any &s;entence dropt towards evening, &s;ignifying his ma&s;ter's de|&s;ign to take his moon-light &s;troll, or retire to bed earlier than u&s;ual, on the pretence of &s;udden indi&s;po&s;ition,&mdash;or, if he &s;aw Hen|ry
<PB N="212" REF="222">more than u&s;ually merry or &s;ad,&mdash;(for, &s;o well had he &s;tudied him, he looked upon both the&s;e extremes as &s;ymptomatic)&mdash;he was from that in&s;tant at work.&mdash;He had long known, that no impediments of wea|ther could prevent his ma&s;ter's going forth, when the wandering &s;pirit &s;eized him.&mdash;If then the night was &s;tormy, or likely &s;o to be, George would be provided with his comfortables, as he called them, according to the &s;tate of the element.&mdash;He would be as re&s;tle&s;s in the kitchen, or &s;ervants' hall, as his ma&s;ter in the parlour, or 'drawing-room.&mdash;George was as great a favourite below &s;tairs, as was his ma&s;ter above;&mdash;and his fellow &s;ervants found it difficult to make him &s;it down to a di&s;h of tea; or, if they prevailed, and his hour was almo&s;t come, he would &s;wallow it in ha&s;te.&mdash;The maids jeered him upon this:&mdash;one &s;aid, he was like a troubled &s;pirit;&mdash;another likened him to a bad con&s;cience;&mdash;and the butler, who was a great &s;cholar, to the perpetual motion.&mdash;Rachel, one of the hou&s;e-maids,
<PB N="213" REF="223">who was &s;u&s;pected to have a kindne&s;s for him, to&s;&s;ed up her head, and &s;aid, "She &s;uppo&s;ed, the poor devil was in love,&mdash;and, that he had &s;ome lady or another, who met him every night in a fairy bower:&mdash;but for her part, &s;he never knew any good come of forward hu&s;&s;ies who went &s;kulking after fellows in lanes and alleys:&mdash;if a man fol|lows a woman," &s;aid &s;he,&mdash;"let him follow her fair and above board;&mdash;for her part, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed a brat would be laid at the gentleman's door, for all his &s;lyne&s;s."&mdash;&mdash;"Lord, Mrs. Rachel," replies Mrs. cook,&mdash;"why, for &s;artain &s;ure you are jealous:&mdash;Mr. George has only got the fidgets; and as for brats," here &s;he winked with one eye at the coachman, and looked &s;tedfa&s;tly at Mrs. Rachel's &s;hape, with the other,&mdash;"as for the matter of <HI>brats,</HI>&mdash;my notion of the&s;eum things is, that they are to be had, <HI>without</HI> going into lanes and alleys, or out of the hou&s;e either.&mdash;What &s;ay you, coachee?"&mdash;Here the cook began the laugh; the coachee, as &s;he called him, continued it; and the re&s;t joined in chorus,&mdash;till Rachel would &s;ome|times
<PB N="214" REF="224">times bitterly a&s;&s;ert, that "heaven knows, nobody can ever accu&s;e <HI>you,</HI> Mrs. cook, of having brats!&mdash;you may thank God for that, however:&mdash;look in the gla&s;s,&mdash;that's all&mdash;look in the gla&s;s."&mdash;At other times, &s;he would content her&s;elf with calling every one a pack of &s;landerous, <HI>enviable</HI> per&s;on|ages, take her&s;elf off into her lady's cham|ber, where &s;he often &s;at at work,&mdash;&s;aying, as &s;he left the room, "It &s;erved her right for mixing with a &s;et of vulgar, vandal-goth &s;ouls, who were born to the kitchen!&mdash;<HI>She</HI> was naturally a parlour-bred young wo|man."</P>
<P>None of the&s;e gibes or jeers, however, had the &s;malle&s;t effect upon George, who heard them out, if he was certain of his ma&s;ter;&mdash;and if not, he would often leave them in the mid&s;t of their irony, and pur|&s;ue his de&s;igns.&mdash;Once, indeed, he was dogged by another of the &s;ervants, as far as the outer gate that led into the park: but, luckily, Henry was then a good way for|ward; and George, turning round, told the fellow, that "if he followed him an inch

<P>George, however, was &s;o kind-hearted a young fellow, and &s;o generally beloved, that every body forgave him, but Mrs. Ra|chel; and even the man he &s;o dreadfully menaced, exclaimed, "Why, 'tis after a woman, I warrant; and there's no harm in that.&mdash;He that won't go out at pitch dark after a woman, ought to be d****d."&mdash;But

<P>In &s;hort, George made u&s;e of as many &s;tratagems, and was as much put to his &s;hifts, to avoid being &s;een or &s;u&s;pected by his ma&s;ter, as his ma&s;ter put in practice to e&s;cape the detection of Olivia, who&s;e cu&s;|tom of becoming, as heretofore, the com|panion of his wanderings, he had for &s;ome time as much as po&s;&s;ible prevented.</P>
<P>George, however, was him&s;elf in no &s;mall hazard of being di&s;covered, as he was now following his ma&s;ter to the abbey;&mdash;for when Henry had got almo&s;t to the ca&s;tle-gate, after cur&s;ing his fortune at every &s;e|cond

<P>Henry then a&s;ked him&s;elf, why the Mon|tagues and Capulets &s;hould be thus at va|riance?&mdash;Then an&s;wered his own que&s;tion. "My only love &s;prung from my only hate!" cried he. "Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!</P>

<P>At the end of this rhap&s;ody, he &s;et off at full &s;peed, as if carried away by the &s;en|timent:&mdash;and he had, indeed, &s;o ab&s;olutely made the ca&s;e his own,&mdash;forcing it to apply where it did not, and appearing almo&s;t to think he was the identical Romeo, where it did,&mdash;that, had not the darkne&s;s favoured,&mdash;at the &s;ight of a man running as fa&s;t as he could towards the avenue, and then hiding behind the trees in the vi&s;ta,&mdash;George would have had good rea&s;on to &s;ay, with Mercutio, "A plague o' both your hou&s;es!"</P>

<P>The good fellow quietly undre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf: but the affair of Romeo and Juliet, the Montagues and Capulets, had quite &s;ettled with him his ma&s;ter's madne&s;s, which he now con&s;idered as incurable: and his la&s;t words that night were, "Ah! poor dear gentleman! it's all over with him now, &s;ure enough.&mdash;What a terrible thing love is, when it comes to this!&mdash;Heigho!&mdash;The Lord deliver us!&mdash;I won|der how Jenny is to night.&mdash;I hope I never &s;hall love at this rate!"</P>

<P>WHATEVER ro&s;es hope might &s;trew on the pillow of Olivia, that of Henry was on this night lined with thorns.&mdash;When, for an in&s;tant, he dropt into a tran&s;itory &s;lum|ber, all the images of a di&s;turbed imagina|tion and tortured mind ro&s;e to his view.&mdash;At one moment his fancy repre&s;ented him to&s;&s;ing in the ocean, at another labouring in mud;&mdash;&s;ometimes his ears were a&s;&s;ailed by the &s;hrieks of both Caroline and Olivia, falling in the general ruin;&mdash;and &s;ometimes he beheld his friend Charles pointing a dag|ger at his bo&s;om.</P>
<P>In his waking hours, he often re&s;olved on a &s;tratagem to e&s;cape the union of Olivia, by an elopement with Caroline,&mdash;and pro|jected this &s;o as to form a double plot, includ|ing the flight of Olivia with Charles.&mdash;The violent emotions accompanying this idea, extravagant as it was, operated with &s;uch force on his burning fancy, that he &s;uddenly
<PB N="222" REF="232">&s;tarted upright in his bed, and exclaimed, "Would it were morning!&mdash;I will be at the abbey by day-break!&mdash;Surely, Charles is by this time arrived!&mdash;If not, I will go po&s;t to meet him!&mdash;Were he at the end of the earth, I would travel towards him!"&mdash;Then pre&s;&s;ing his repeater, which hung at the bed'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> head, he found, to his infinite mortification, that it was only two o'clock.</P>
<P>The &s;ound of his exclamations had pierced the ear of the tru&s;ty George, who had him|&s;elf been kept awake by his own reflections, partly about his ma&s;ter, and partly about him&s;elf;&mdash;for the havoc he had witne&s;&s;ed in a human brea&s;t by di&s;appointment in love, made a very &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion, and convinced him more fully of a truth he had before begun to &s;u&s;pect, in regard to his own heart.</P>
<P>George was certainly much alarmed at the &s;tate of his ma&s;ter, yet no le&s;s &s;truck at the prodigious effects of the pa&s;&s;ion it&s;elf;&mdash;and as well from the dread of his being one day reduced to the &s;ame condition, as from the hope that he &s;hould not,&mdash;each lover
<PB N="223" REF="233">commonly making him&s;elf the <HI>happy</HI> excep|tion to a general rule,&mdash;he was effectually kept from clo&s;ing his eyes.</P>
<P>The moment, therefore, he heard Henry's concluding a&s;&s;everation, that, were Charles at the end of the earth, he would travel towards him,&mdash;he leaped out of his own bed, and was at the &s;ide of his ma&s;ter's, ju&s;t as the watch had repeated the inau&s;picious hour.</P>
<P>"For goodne&s;s' &s;ake, what is the matter with your honour?&mdash;Can I do any thing for your honour my&s;elf?&mdash;Shall I go for the doctor?&mdash;Shall I call up the re&s;t of the &s;ervants?&mdash;or the family?&mdash;I fear your honour is very bad.&mdash;How is your honour's head?&mdash;Hot&mdash;very hot&mdash;all of a coal!&mdash;your honour is in a high fever!&mdash;let me &s;trike a light."</P>
<P>"No," an&s;wered Henry, "not &s;o, ho|ne&s;t fellow.&mdash;I know you love me, George."</P>
<P>"Love you, your honour! Yes!" though <HI>my</HI> di&s;tracted &s;en&s;es, too, &s;hould for&s;ake me,&mdash;"I'd find, as the play &s;ays, and as I have
<PB N="224" REF="234">heard your honour &s;ay,&mdash;I'd find &s;ome inter|val, when&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Go then to bed," &s;aid Henry: "ri&s;e at the fir&s;t peep of dawn:&mdash;run to the abbey;&mdash;a&s;k if Lieutenant Stuart is arrived, and bring me word, unknown to any body."</P>
<P>"He <HI>is</HI> arrived, your honour: our coach|man told me he &s;aw him ride by the park pales about ten o'clock la&s;t night; which mu&s;t be &s;oon after we&mdash;we&mdash;that is, after your honour, left the abbey."</P>
<P>"Arrived!" an&s;wered Henry. "Then let my own hor&s;e and your's be &s;addled, and in the &s;table, ready to mount, by four o'clock. Leave me now; and be &s;ure you are not after the time, my good George."</P>
<P>"I'll make very &s;ure of that, your honour, by not going to bed any more.&mdash;Try to get a bit of re&s;t your&s;elf, dear good &s;ir; and I will call you to the click of the quarters, &s;o that you &s;hall be on hor&s;eback as the clock is &s;triking."</P>
<P>George,&mdash;knowing this to be the be&s;t mode of arranging the bu&s;ine&s;s, both for
<PB N="225" REF="235">his ma&s;ter's ea&s;e, and his own,&mdash;did not wait for any objections thereto,&mdash;but com|mending Henry's lo&s;t wits to God, &s;hut the door of the chamber, and returned to his own.</P>
<P>At the time appointed, with an accuracy that marked the exactne&s;s of his character, he had not only done his work in the &s;table, but in the hou&s;e al&s;o; for he had made a fire, boiled the kettle, had a di&s;h of coffee, and all his <HI>comfortables,</HI> &s;miling upon a table, in what was called the hunting parlour, to greet his ma&s;ter, on coming down &s;tairs,&mdash;and by calling Henry a few minutes earlier than the &s;pecified hour, had allowed time for taking the refre&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>What was the nature of his ma&s;ter's bu|&s;ine&s;s, George never enquired. This young man had fir&s;t been in the &s;ervice of John Fitzorton, as the reader remembers, while yet a boy, and &s;ince a private in John's regi|ment; and had &s;o well profited by his mili|tary education, that he practi&s;ed ever after towards his commanding officer,&mdash;and &s;uch
<PB N="226" REF="236">he now looked upon Henry to be,&mdash;the law of non-re&s;i&s;tance and pa&s;&s;ive obedience.&mdash;Indeed, a &s;light nod often te&s;tified his a&s;&s;ent to what was required of him: but mo&s;t commonly the la&s;t word of any me&s;&s;age &s;ent him off without any &s;ign or token at all.</P>
<P>Henry, however, having had lei&s;ure to reflect on the incon&s;i&s;tency, ingratitude, and even impo&s;&s;ibility of carrying his wild &s;cheme into execution,&mdash;told George that he had altered his mind as to &s;etting out &s;o early, but &s;hould perhaps ride or walk to &s;ee his friend Mr. Stuart in the cour&s;e of the day, and would try to &s;leep an hour or two now, that he might be ready to attend his own family at breakfa&s;t;&mdash;and cordially advi&s;ed George to do the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The joy of our worthy dome&s;tic, on &s;ee|ing his ma&s;ter unexpectedly compo&s;ed, was &s;o great, that he &s;unk involuntarily upon his knees, exclaiming with much fervency, "The Lord be prai&s;ed!"&mdash;then drawing the curtains, and clo&s;ing part of the &s;hutter next to the bed, that the light might not prove unfavourable to his ma&s;ter's &s;lumbers,
<PB N="227" REF="237">&mdash;he went on tiptoe out of the apartment, reiterating in whi&s;pers,&mdash;"the Lord be prai&s;ed! the Lord, of his infinite mercy, be prai&s;ed!&mdash;He may do yet."</P>
<P>Henry's fixed re&s;olution, however, was,&mdash;let the con&s;equence be what it might, or whatever involvements it might bring upon the abbey, or the ca&s;tle, or both,&mdash;to make a full and free confe&s;&s;ion of the pa&s;t and pre&s;ent, and long-e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;tate of his affections, in the cour&s;e of that very day,&mdash;and, indeed, at all hazards, to prevent his union with Olivia Clare, even if the lo&s;s of Caroline Stuart, and his own ruin, &s;hould be the i&s;&s;ue of the explanation.</P>

<P>AFTER turning this, at length irrevo|cable determination, as he called it, into various &s;hapes,&mdash;how be&s;t to proceed in it,&mdash;
<PB N="228" REF="238">whether to begin by di&s;cour&s;e with Olivia, with James, or with his mother, who&s;e heart he knew was his own.&mdash;or whether to make his confe&s;&s;ions, and his "round unvarni&s;hed tale deliver" in pre&s;ence of the <HI>whole</HI> fa|mily,&mdash;he lay for &s;ome time in a &s;tate be|twixt &s;leeping and waking,&mdash;a &s;tate pro|duced by a violent ten&s;ion of the thoughts to one of tho&s;e objects which hurries the animal &s;pirits, till the mind, having fa|tigued it&s;elf and the body, is compelled, from very heavine&s;s of the fle&s;h and &s;pirit, to grant the relief of a pau&s;e,&mdash;during which we cannot &s;trictly be &s;aid either to &s;leep or wake:&mdash;the word, which, for lack of a better, we have for it, is <HI>dozing,</HI> a kind of intermediate &s;tate betwixt a vehement emotion and no emotion at all;&mdash;the mind &s;till carrying on, though feebly, her former de&s;igns, till the body, relaxed and languid, is unable to keep pace with her;&mdash;and a per&s;on may lie in this &s;tate &s;everal hours, and find him&s;elf, in the end, without any material refre&s;hment.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="239">Out of this dozing then Henry was a|rou&s;ed by a &s;cratching at the door, as from the foot of a dog:&mdash;this was pre&s;ently fol|lowed by another, and that again by a whine, which &s;poke, as plainly as any lan|guage, that, whoever might be the peti|tioner, he earne&s;tly de&s;ired to be admitted. As Henry was going to the door, he was &s;a|luted by the barking of the &s;aid petitioner, ac|companied by a &s;mart pat again&s;t the pan|nel of the door, indicating that, having done with &s;upplication, the &s;aid pat might be con|&s;idered as a &s;ort of threat to effect a forcible entry in ca&s;e of longer re&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;On open|ing the door, who &s;hould make his appear|ance but little Fitz,&mdash;&s;o was he called,&mdash;the favourite and almo&s;t con&s;tant companion of Caroline Stuart.&mdash;It had been Henry's gift to that young lady, who was grown &s;o fond of it, partly for its own &s;ake and partly for the donor's, that &s;he never &s;uffered it out of her &s;ight without feeling unea&s;y.&mdash;It had been pre&s;ent, of cour&s;e, at all the &s;cenes of joy and &s;orrow which had pa&s;&s;ed between the lovers, and there|fore
<PB N="230" REF="240">was much in the good graces of both.</P>
<P>But, how to account for this unexpected vi&s;it, Henry could no way conjecture.&mdash;However, little Fitz came at the right mo|ment to receive a hearty welcome;&mdash;for Henry no &s;ooner beheld his vi&s;itor, than he hugged, ki&s;&s;ed, and called him as many en|dearing epithets, as if it had been Caroline her&s;elf.&mdash;The fancy of Henry, always ready to encourage the illu&s;ions of his heart, &s;oon gave to this delightful "airy nothing," more than "a local habitation." He called the dog dear little name-&s;ake:&mdash;indeed it was at his own de&s;ire Fitz had been &s;o ho|noured;&mdash;"For," &s;aid Henry, "it will make Caroline then think of the donor."&mdash;He a&s;&s;ured little Fitz, that he was more grate|ful for his attention now, than at any for|mer period of their friend&s;hip for each other, as he was convinced he came on purpo&s;e to comfort him in the hour of his de&s;pair:&mdash;"But how did you find your way to my chamber?&mdash;and how long ha&s;t thou been &s;itting at my door, poor fellow?&mdash;And
<PB N="231" REF="241">why did&s;t thou not addre&s;s thy&s;elf to me before?&mdash;So thrive my &s;oul, as I would &s;hare with thee my bed and board, &s;ooner than with the fine&s;t object amid&s;t the works of creation, thy mi&s;tre&s;s alone excepted.&mdash;But what will &s;he &s;ay to thy playing truant?&mdash;does &s;he know of thy coming?&mdash;or did Caroline &s;end thee in charity to Henry?"</P>
<P>He continued this rhap&s;ody much farther, and kindled in his cour&s;e, till it is to be doubted whether he did not really expect regular replies to tho&s;e interrogatories.&mdash;Be that as it may, we never under&s;tood that the dog gave any an&s;wer whatever,&mdash;&s;ave that he had now changed the whine of com|plaint, to the exulting note of joy;&mdash;for it admits not of a doubt, that the little ani|mal was extremely glad to &s;ee Henry, who had frequently taken him into the fields and fore&s;ts, and treated him with the &s;ight of a hare or partridge;&mdash;for which, as well as other tokens of good-will, little Fitz, who was extremely well born, and well edu|cated too,&mdash;being of the &s;paniel kind and of a choice breed,&mdash;was entirely grateful; &s;o
<PB N="232" REF="242">that, in fact, there was no love lo&s;t betwixt him and Henry.</P>
<P>But, whatever impre&s;&s;ion this enthu&s;ia&s;tic addre&s;s to little Fitz might make upon <HI>him,</HI> it &s;unk peculiarly deep into the mind of True George. The door being open when the dog entered, he heard quite &s;ufficient to convince him that the few hopes he had before enter|tained of his ma&s;ter's wits being re&s;tored, were now over, and that the unhappy gen|tleman was ten times more di&s;tracted than ever.</P>
<P>The various que&s;tions he heard put to the dog, gave George the &s;tronge&s;t apprehen|&s;ions even of raving madne&s;s: but when Henry, with the utmo&s;t extravagance of voice, talked about &s;haring bed and board with the dog, and giving him the prefe|rence to all the objects of created nature ex|cept Caroline,&mdash;the poor fellow could hardly contain his &s;orrowful emotions, which, in de&s;pite of him&s;elf, forced their way between his teeth, as he muttered "Alas! quite gone!&mdash;mad as a March hare!&mdash;Lord have mercy upon us!&mdash;If I thought the ca&s;e would ever
<PB N="233" REF="243">be mine, I'd hang my&s;elf at once out of the way! Oh Jenny!&mdash;Jenny!&mdash;All this for a dumb bea&s;t!&mdash;very well in his place! I would not hurt a worm!&mdash;but a worm is a worm;&mdash;and a dog is a dog,&mdash;and a dog is a bea&s;t of the field;&mdash;and what is a bea&s;t to do in a man's bed, except a Chri&s;tian gives him a pat, and away, or &s;o, to get him down,&mdash;as much as to &s;ay, 'If you plea&s;e, &s;ir, off my bed, and make room for your betters:' and, to be &s;ure, Chri&s;tians are better than dumb bea&s;ts at any time; and if they a'n't, more &s;hame for 'em.&mdash;Poor &s;oul!&mdash;quite lo&s;t in|deed! &mdash;gone for ever!&mdash;O merciful father! for pity, how mad he is!"</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of this &s;peech was delivered as George walked to and fro in the long gallery, which extending the whole length of the bedchambers, Henry heard only the words which began and ended it&mdash;viz, "quite lo&s;t!&mdash;mad as a March hare!&mdash;gone for ever," &amp;c. To which he replied, "What's that you &s;ay?&mdash;who's there?&mdash;George?"</P>
<P>"Yes, your honour," replied George,
<PB N="234" REF="244">giving the matter a turn for fear of making his ma&s;ter wor&s;e,&mdash;ever an uppermo&s;t idea,&mdash; "'tis only me, &s;ir."&mdash;"Gone for ever&mdash;and mad as a March hare&mdash;what are you talking about?" &s;aid Henry.&mdash;"Little Fitz, plea&s;e your honour.&mdash;I found, after we&mdash;that is, your honour&mdash;got home, he had followed us&mdash;fol|lowed you, that is&mdash;from the abbey; &s;o I let him have a night's lodging in my room, know|ing he was Lady Caroline's dog, and made him a &s;nug birth in the corner: and when I got up he was off; and I was &s;aying to my|&s;elf, &mdash;&s;ays I,&mdash;he's gone&mdash;he's lo&s;t&mdash;and if he is, it will make Lady Caroline as mad as a March hare.&mdash;But I &s;ee your honour has him &s;afe; &s;o it's all well. But breakfa&s;t waits, your honour."</P>
<P>"Well then," &s;aid Henry, "give this dear little fellow &s;omething to eat; and keep him out of &s;ight till I can walk over with him to the abbey; and be &s;ure you let him have what he likes: for, d**n me if I don't love him almo&s;t as well as if&mdash;"</P>
<P>"He &s;hall be taken good care of, your honour, depend on it," interpo&s;ed George,
<PB N="235" REF="245">lifting him from the bed, and walking off with him under his arm, before Henry could fini&s;h his a&s;&s;everation.</P>
<P>Henry had always been much attached to, and not a little &s;uper&s;titious about the fide|lity and genius of dogs: and this friendly vi&s;it of little Fitz was, to his poetic heart, a fre&s;h proof that the canine came very near to the human &s;pecies, in tho&s;e matters, barring &s;ome very nice and &s;ubtle di&s;tinc|tions, about which he would &s;ometimes rea|&s;on with John, till that philo&s;ophic youth would pronounce him, as did True George, &s;ometimes to be mad, and &s;ometimes only merry.</P>
<P>It was in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e a yet farther confirmation, when, before Henry had left his chamber, little Fitz had given George the &s;lip, and again paid his re&s;pects to the lover of Caroline. And at the time of this his &s;econd appearance, Henry was offering his devotions to Caroline's miniature. This, he told Fitz, le&s;t he &s;hould approach it in an unhallowed manner&mdash;this, he told Fitz, was the picture of her they both adored.
<PB N="236" REF="246">"But, you happy creature," added Henry, you will be fondled by the original when I, perhaps&mdash;" He then fell to care&s;&s;ing the &s;pa|niel and the picture by turns, and concluded, by exclaiming, as he was going out of his room, "Dear, precious re&s;emblance!&mdash;ne|ver &mdash;never&mdash;will I part with thee!&mdash;not Death him&s;elf &s;hall &s;natch thee from me!"</P>
<P>The chamber-door was all this time wide open, and the above words were heard di|&s;tinctly, and the &s;peaker of them &s;een, by Lady Fitzorton, Mr. Clare, and Olivia,&mdash;the two latter at that in&s;tant coming from Oli|via's chamber, where the former had, as u&s;ual, given her a gentle &s;ummons, to &s;ee if her daughter, as &s;he always called her, was ready to go down to breakfa&s;t; and they met Mr. Clare as he was &s;hutting the door of his apartment.</P>
<P>The trio were all of one mind, as to what they heard and &s;aw. Olivia ble&s;&s;ed her&s;elf, and cried,&mdash;"Dear &s;oul!&mdash;how he honours my poor gift!&mdash;See madam,"&mdash;turning to Lady Fitzorton,&mdash;"ought I not to be proud?"&mdash;"It gives me almo&s;t as much joy as it does
<PB N="237" REF="247">you," replied her lady&s;hip: "for as he was not prepared for our coming, as you &s;ee by his agreeble confu&s;ion, we may be &s;ure his care&s;&s;es of the picture are&mdash; <Q>Warm from his heart and faithful to its fires.</Q> "Hey, Henry!" exclaimed Mr. Clare, "what &s;ignify your pro&s;ings, to a bard caught in &s;o poetical a &s;ituation?&mdash;There's a quotation for him, that de&s;cribes him in his own way.&mdash;.For my part, I &s;ay nothing:&mdash;but were I Olivia, I &s;hould be little plea&s;ed with the cold compliment paid to my inani|mate picture, when the original &s;tood bloom|ing like the morning before him, without his &s;o much as offering to&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Come, madam," &s;aid Olivia, "&s;hall we go down &s;tairs?"&mdash;"With all my heart, my dear," an&s;wered Lady Fitz|orton:&mdash;"Mr. Clare <HI>will</HI> have his joke, you know."</P>
<P>"You'll follow, Henry," &s;aid Olivia, blu&s;h|ing delightfully and tripping down &s;tairs. "Is your friend Charles come? and, pray,
<PB N="238" REF="248">how fares my &s;weet play-fellow, my &s;weet friend?"</P>
<P>Olivia recollected it might not be quite prudent to mention Caroline's name at that in&s;tant, and &s;o made the be&s;t of her way.</P>
<P>Henry had &s;eldom been thrown into a more aukward &s;ituation. The mi&s;take of the miniature, which, on being di&s;covered, he put ha&s;tily out of &s;ight, was &s;o extremely natural, and &s;o impo&s;&s;ible to be then explained, that he was utterly confounded; and his complex|ion now almo&s;t as nearly re&s;embled the car|nation as Olivia's: a circum&s;tance which lite|rally gave a &s;till &s;tronger <HI>colour</HI> to the &s;uppo&s;i|tion that the picture he had been &s;o tran&s;|ported with, was the one that Olivia had pre&s;ented.</P>
<P>What became of little Fitz, we never heard: but it is probable he had &s;hyed off at the &s;ight of &s;o much unexpected company; for he had naturally more diffidence than be|longs to favourites in general, whether of the biped or quadruped kind. But, indeed, he might very po&s;&s;ibly have been at Henry's feet, and not noticed by either of the parties in their
<PB N="239" REF="249">confu&s;ion; and, for the moment, Henry him&s;elf forgot, perhaps, that this "dear little &s;oul, whom he preferred to created na|ture," had any exi&s;tence within the bounds of the univer&s;e. Be that as it may, Henry went down to breakfa&s;t:&mdash;but from what happened afterwards,&mdash;and, indeed, from what might be expected to happen from the que&s;tions which would ari&s;e on the unex|pected &s;ight of &s;uch a gue&s;t,&mdash;we are rather inclined to think Henry did not perceive his companion till it was too late. Of this the reader will pre&s;ently form his own judgment.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXX.</HEAD>
<P>SIR ARMINE FITZORTON, who &s;tood in the great hall which led from the cham|bers to &s;everal of the apartments, encoun|tered Henry as he came down &s;tairs, and received him with an ardour of affection and applau&s;e, to which nothing but Henry's con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of not de&s;erving it, could have rendered him in&s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>"It is &s;urely decreed," &s;aid Sir Armine,
<PB N="240" REF="250">embracing Henry, "that my life is to be pre|&s;erved by one or other of my children. Twice has it already been in danger, and twice have my &s;ons re&s;cued me!&mdash;Here, Henry, is the accur&s;ed &s;croll, who&s;e contents, had they been true, would have been far more fatal than the injury which this aged frame re|ceived from Sir Gui&s;e Stuart's hor&s;e: for I am convinced they would have broken mine and your mother's heart.&mdash;Henry, therefore, merits, in a &s;till greater degree even than our beloved John, the title of <HI>his Parent's Pre&s;erver.</HI>&mdash;I am grateful and I am happy."</P>
<P>The venerable man threw his arms round Henry's neck, and wept;&mdash;a circum&s;tance no way incon&s;i&s;tent with the tran&s;port either of gratitude or happine&s;s, and which nature often adduces in proof of both.</P>
<P>The heart of Henry, though throbbing with love for Caroline, was by no means unmoved by &s;uch an appeal to it. It is more than probable indeed, that at &s;uch a moment his heart had little to do with Caroline, or with any thing in this world but with the &s;a|cred object in his embrace.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="251">"Oh Sir!" exclaimed he, "I cannot,&mdash; indeed I cannot bear it! Spare me, I conjure you; for I feel powerfully, that the&s;e tears, and the goodne&s;s which occa&s;ions them, will be more fatal than that paper, what|ever it may &s;ugge&s;t.&mdash;I cannot &s;peak!&mdash;my dear,&mdash;<HI>dear,</HI> father! I cannot &s;peak!"</P>
<P>"I perceive, my child, thou can&s;t not.&mdash;Ble&s;&s;ings upon thee! Let us ha&s;ten then to tho&s;e who&s;e affection for you is equal to my own."</P>
<P>They proceeded towards the breakfa&s;t parlour, the door of which was at that mo|ment opened by Olivia, who began to be impatient of Henry's delay.&mdash;"Your tea will be quite cold, gentlemen," &s;aid &s;he, complainingly.</P>
<P>Sir Armine turned his face gently from her, and &s;aid, "Give me your hand, Olivia, and let us take a turn or two before we go in.&mdash;There, Henry! do you follow my ex|ample."</P>
<P>Henry took the other hand, and they all three traver&s;ed the hall for the &s;pace of &s;ome
<PB N="242" REF="252">minutes,&mdash;Sir Armine attempting to hide &s;trong emotions, and Henry labouring in the &s;ame way. Both were un&s;ucce&s;sful; Olivia perceived they had been in tears, and indeed &s;till di&s;covered &s;ome which had lodged in the furrows of Sir Armine's cheek.</P>
<P>"Heavens!" &s;aid &s;he, "what can the&s;e mean?" wiping them &s;oftly away with the back of her hand:&mdash;"and yours, Henry, are not quite dry," &s;aid &s;he, removing them by the like action.</P>
<P>"Why &s;hould we endeavour, my &s;on, to conceal the effects of our tran&s;port from any one, but lea&s;t of all from her who has a right to &s;hare them?&mdash;Daughter," conti|nued Sir Armine, "what you have noticed in our countenances, has been produced by the joy of our hearts;&mdash;and it was churli&s;h in us to wi&s;h to rob you of your ju&s;t divi&s;ion. This our Henry has&mdash;but no matter,&mdash;I charge you to love him better than ever, and if he proves to you as good a hu&s;band, as he has done to me a &s;on,&mdash;as <HI>I</HI> am, there|by,
<PB N="243" REF="253">the happie&s;t of fathers, &s;o will <HI>you</HI> be the mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed of wives. A&s;k no more que&s;tions, but let us to breakfa&s;t."</P>
<P>"It is very unfair, however, of you," &s;aid Olivia with all imaginable &s;weetne&s;s, as if betwixt &s;port and earne&s;t, "to have all this tran&s;port to your&s;elves: for I would have you to know I am as fond of weeping for joy as either of you, and am now almo&s;t ready to cry with grief, at your cheating me in this cruel manner. And as to being more fond of this creature than I ever was before, I am &s;orry, Sir, at the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;obeying you in this particular; for he very well knows, that&mdash;that&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Knows what?" que&s;tioned Sir Armine.</P>
<P>"That it is impo&s;&s;ible," whi&s;pered &s;he; but the whi&s;per was conveyed in another of tho&s;e &s;tage tones which have &s;o amply been di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in one of the family conver&s;ations; for, when &s;he mentioned to Sir Armine the impo&s;&s;ibility of loving Henry <HI>better</HI> than &s;he had done, &s;he certainly intended her lover &s;hould hear. Indeed, &s;he re&s;igned her hand to his care&s;&s;es while this rea&s;on was commu|nicated;
<PB N="244" REF="254">and gliding her&s;elf between Henry and Sir Armine,&mdash;the former in almo&s;t an oblivion of every thing but his filial love,&mdash;&s;he drew them into the apartment.</P>
<P>As they entered, little Fitz had placed him&s;elf in Olivia's chair, and thinking, per|haps, he had waited long enough for his breakfa&s;t, was helping him&s;elf very cordially to &s;ome bread and butter, that &s;tood commo|diou&s;ly near him;&mdash;Lady Fitzorton and Mr. Clare having entered into a &s;erious t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te at the other end of the room.</P>
<P>Olivia, therefore, running to him, &s;aid, "Oh! but I forgot, Henry, to tell you about this dear little dog:&mdash;he is quite taken with me:&mdash;I think he likes the ca&s;tle better than the abbey.&mdash;What is his name?&mdash;I &s;ee by the collar, he belongs to&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;"</P>
<P>Olivia checked her&s;elf on a caution|ary hint from Henry: and, though &s;he could not gue&s;s the motive of that hint, as the name of the dog's owner was no longer pro&s;cribed, her Henry's wi&s;hes were always followed by prompt and &s;miling obedience.</P>
<P>As Sir Armine advanced towards little
<PB N="245" REF="255">Fitz, Henry's agitation was &s;o extreme, he involuntarily took hold of his father's coat, to prevent his examining the collar.</P>
<P>Olivia was taken up with con&s;idering the beauty of the animal, &s;o that Henry's &s;itua|tion e&s;caped her;&mdash;but Sir Armine gave him &s;uch an interrogating look as &s;ent his very blood into his face to an&s;wer it.</P>
<P>"Let <HI>me</HI> &s;ee, Olivia!" &s;aid Sir Armine, &s;tooping down, as if to read the engraved letters.</P>
<P>"Indeed, you mu&s;t not Sir!" cried Oli|via, turning the collar round, till the engraved part was hid under the dog's throat.&mdash;"Dear Sir, he does not choo&s;e to tell the name of his owner: be&s;ides, 'tis a Family Secret:&mdash;or, perhaps, he means to change his &s;ituation."</P>
<P>"Then he ought to bring a character from his la&s;t place," &s;aid Lady Fitzorton, now fir&s;t joining in the di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>"Very true," &s;aid Mr. Clare:&mdash;"&s;o pray Mr. what's-your-name, whom do you be|long to?"</P>
<P>"Don't mention Sir Gui&s;e! &s;ay, he belongs
<PB N="246" REF="256">to Caroline,"&mdash;whi&s;pered Olivia to Henry, "and&mdash;and&mdash;"</P>
<P>Judge, reader, if this was not helping this lame dog over the &s;tile, with a vengeance.</P>
<P>"If you mu&s;t know,"&mdash;&s;aid Olivia,&mdash;"the little fellow belongs to Mi&s;s Stuart: only, you know, we are not to talk about it, as, perhaps, &s;ome other per&s;on's name may be on the collar:&mdash;and though I know you are all too good 'to turn your <HI>enemy's</HI> dog out of doors,'without his breakfa&s;t, I&mdash;I&mdash;in &s;hort, I had half a mind to &s;teal him, and love him for his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es &s;ake."</P>
<P>"If you will but help me out, this will do nicely,"&mdash;added Olivia to Henry,&mdash;<HI>not</HI> in a &s;tage whi&s;per.</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Stuart!"&mdash;&s;aid Mr. Clare&mdash;"then you ought, I am &s;ure, to be jealous, either of the dog or his mi&s;tre&s;s; for I &s;aw Henry almo&s;t devouring him with ki&s;&s;es."</P>
<P>"And I could ki&s;s him my&s;elf,"&mdash;&s;aid Olivia,&mdash;"for he's a dear and a love; and if I did not think it would break Mi&s;s Stuart's heart, I <HI>would</HI> &s;teal him. Yes, I would, you dear thing!" added Olivia, renewing her ca|re&s;&s;es:
<PB N="247" REF="257">&mdash;"not that I &s;aw Henry ki&s;s him at all&mdash;It was &s;omething el&s;e I &s;aw him ki&s;s."</P>
<P>The bloom which accompanied this ob|&s;ervation, covered the cheeks of Olivia, and was inexpre&s;&s;ibly beautiful.</P>
<P>"Admitted," &s;aid Mr.Clare, plea&s;antly:&mdash;"but, methinks, a lover of mine would not a little anger me, if he were to &s;alute the prettie&s;t cur in the world, and my pic|ture, in the &s;ame breath;&mdash;however, as that is your bu&s;ine&s;s, not mine, you mu&s;t e'en &s;ettle it between you."</P>
<P>"Let you and I, Lady Fitzorton, fini&s;h our breakfa&s;t as fa&s;t as we can, and go on with our conver&s;ation, which, as is but too often the ca&s;e, a puppy in favour has in|terrupted."</P>
<P>With all the&s;e reliefs, Henry had collec|tion enough to &s;ay, the dog was a favourite at the abbey, from whence it had followed him, as it had done more than once before, though not perhaps noticed;&mdash;but that, as often as it did, he &s;ent it back immediately, knowing what &s;earch there would be after it,&mdash;
<PB N="248" REF="258">as he &s;hould have done now, had he di&s;cover|ed it in time.</P>
<P>Henry now patted the dog's head,&mdash;and &s;aid, "he &s;uppo&s;ed, if he did not &s;end or take it back &s;oon, there would be a &s;earch-warrant after it."</P>
<P>Breakfa&s;t now went on &s;moothly, except that Sir Armine and Henry rather over|acted their parts,&mdash;the former being too talkative, and the latter too taciturn,&mdash;yet both equally anxious to conceal their &s;en&s;a|tions.</P>
<P>The engraving luckily e&s;caped;&mdash;for the collar bore the&s;e words:&mdash;"LITTLE FITZ; the gift of HENRY TO CAROLINE."</P>
<P>Mr. Clare and Lady Fitzorton di&s;ap|peared:&mdash;Olivia &s;oon followed, and ran up &s;tairs with the &s;paniel in her arms;&mdash;and almo&s;t in the &s;ame in&s;tant &s;he had &s;o done, True George came whi&s;tling through the hall, calling at every &s;tep, "Little Fitz!&mdash;little Fitz!"&mdash;The door of the breakfa&s;t parlour being left open, George came to the thre&s;hold, put his head into the room, &s;till whi&s;tling for, and calling after, little Fitz.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="259">"What's that you &s;ay,"&mdash;que&s;tioned Sir Armine,&mdash;"about Fitz?"</P>
<P>George in&s;tantly perceived his error, and trying to repair it, an&s;wered&mdash;"Nothing, an't plea&s;e your honour,&mdash;but that I was looking for the litle &s;paniel that had &s;trayed from the abbey, and I was &s;aying to my&s;elf, &s;ays I, (God forgive me for fibbing! <HI>a&s;ide</HI>) if he &s;hould be lo&s;t, the per&s;on he belongs to might go into <HI>fits:</HI>&mdash;that's all, your ho|nour:&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;Jenny Atwood &s;aid,&mdash;'&s;he thought &s;he knew the dog, and&mdash;and had a bit of a fancy to &s;ee him again,'your honour,&mdash;that's all."</P>
<P>"And that's enough," &s;aid Sir Armine:&mdash;"go, and &s;hut the door after you,"</P>
<P>George obeyed the word of command in much perturbation.</P>
<P>Sir Armine &s;poke &s;ternly, and ro&s;e him&s;elf to &s;hut the door, even while he was giving orders.</P>

<P>"HENRY, I wi&s;h to look at Olivia's miniature,&mdash;that which John painted for you."</P>
<P>Forgetting, perhaps, in his confu&s;ion, he had left it with Caroline, for a purpo&s;e the reader may remember, Henry put his hand into his pocket, as if to feel for it; and not finding it there, his agitation increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>"I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;mu&s;t have left it, Sir," &s;tam|mered Henry.</P>
<P>"I mean that," &s;aid Sir Armine, "on which you be&s;towed, as your mother told me, &s;o many care&s;&s;es this morning."</P>
<P>"That, Sir?" cried Henry, his breath al|mo&s;t gone.</P>
<P>"The &s;ame," rejoined his father.&mdash;"Mr. Clare a&s;&s;erted, you have heard, it more than divided with you the fondne&s;s you di&s;covered for Mi&s;s Stuart's &s;paniel!"</P>
<P>"Heaven! Sir! what a compari&s;on!" &s;aid Henry with vehemence.&mdash;"Spaniel!"</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="261">"Yes, little <HI>Fitz,</HI>" ob&s;erved Sir Armine, looking &s;earchingly at Henry.</P>
<P>"But, to leave compari&s;ons, fetch me the picture:&mdash;perhaps it may be left in your chamber; it may be even at this moment on your pillow.&mdash;It ought, by the laws of love, let the original be who &s;he may"&mdash;here his eyes &s;eemed to penetrate into the very heart of his &s;on,&mdash;"it ought, I &s;ay, to be always within reach of your lips. Perhaps it is &s;o now,&mdash;your bo&s;om companion! Let us &s;ee! and pray, &s;ir, what is this?"</P>
<P>His father pointed to a &s;mall piece of ribbon which had, perhaps, in his endea|vour to conceal it from the party who &s;ur|pri&s;ed him at his chamber door, in&s;inuated it&s;elf on the wrong &s;ide of Henry's &s;hirt: and pulling at it abruptly, that bo&s;om-&s;ecret, which had literally been &s;o long &s;u&s;pended, would then have come forth, and Caroline's well-painted re&s;emblance &s;tood confe&s;&s;ed, had not a little conte&s;t en&s;ued between the parties.</P>
<P>Henry defended the pa&s;&s;es to his brea&s;t with his hand, which gra&s;ped the frill of his
<PB N="252" REF="262">&s;hirt, and perhaps, the my&s;tery underneath it.</P>
<P>Sir Armine renewed the attack, &s;aying &s;arca&s;tically,&mdash;"What can be the meaning of all this?&mdash;Is it not Olivia's?&mdash;Is it not the 'counterfeit pre&s;entment' of one who is alike dear to us both?&mdash;The fair object of the fa|ther's choice, as well as the &s;on's! what other <HI>could</HI> be cheri&s;hed in Henry's bo&s;om?&mdash;Is it not Olivia Clare's: and if I am any longer denied the plea&s;ure of paying it my tender re&s;pects, I &s;hall ring for Olivia her&s;elf, and a&s;k her con&s;ent."</P>
<P>Sir Armine, without letting go his hold, made a &s;tep or two towards the bell.</P>
<P>Henry, aiding his father's intentions, tore open his &s;hirt in a kind of phrenzy, and cried, "It mu&s;t&mdash;it mu&s;t be explained! The hour is come!&mdash;thank heaven, the hour is come!&mdash;I am the &s;port of every accident, and will here accumulate or put an end to my mi&s;ery, and all its my&s;teries, at once."</P>
<P>"Have a care!" &s;aid his father, prevent|ing Henry's de&s;ign;&mdash;"have a care! your father's happine&s;s, your father's life, and
<PB N="253" REF="263">not &s;ingly his, but the happine&s;s and life of a man venerable as my&s;elf, of <HI>her</HI> likewi&s;e, who gave life to you,&mdash;and more than the exi&s;tence, probably the &s;elf-de&s;truction, of the innocent Olivia.&mdash;"</P>
<P>Sir Armine panted and pau&s;ed.</P>
<P>"The&s;e, my &s;on, are in your hands, as entirely as if you were our fate.&mdash;Beware then!&mdash;I tremble at the omens I have ju&s;t &s;een!&mdash;Deep plots are di&s;covered by trifling occurrences.&mdash;Heaven forbid I &s;hould be right in my pre&s;ent forebodings!&mdash;oh, if I were!"</P>
<P>Sir Armine's looks and accents &s;eemed to anticipate and confirm the &s;entiments he was about to utter.</P>
<P>"If I were, lo&s;s of fortune and of life would be as the <HI>tender mercies</HI> of God, com|pared to what is re&s;erved for the hou&s;es of Clare and Fitzorton."</P>
<P>Henry falling at Sir Armine's feet, ex|claimed, "That God is my witne&s;s, Sir,&mdash;if the lo&s;s of <HI>my</HI> life could prolong the happi|ne&s;s of yours, and of my mother's, <HI>but one day,</HI>&mdash;with a prayer as earne&s;t as ever came
<PB N="254" REF="264">from the heart of man, I would invoke my death this moment,&mdash;invoke it thus on my knees, a po&s;ture befitting a &s;on to receive it!&mdash;But there are circum&s;tances which would make my exi&s;tence &s;o hateful, &s;o di&s;|honourable in my own eyes.&mdash;This picture, &s;ir, could it &s;peak&mdash;" Here he drew it half from his bo&s;om.</P>
<P>"Forbear, Henry, forbear!" an&s;wered Sir Armine, clo&s;ing his eyes, and averting his head:&mdash;"I will not look on any thing that may&mdash;"</P>
<P>"I have forborne too long," re&s;umed the madding Henry:&mdash;"enthralled by inexpli|cable events, I have been too long involved in a thorny labyrinth;&mdash;and this, O my ho|noured, my almo&s;t adored father,&mdash;this is the cri&s;is at which I mu&s;t <HI>force</HI> my way out of it.&mdash;Hear me, &s;ir! hear me with patience, pity, and parental love, while I confe&s;s,&mdash;while I explain, by what a &s;eries of un|avoidable delays, entanglements, and al|mo&s;t more than human interventions, I have, day after day, onward to weeks, months, years,&mdash;to the de&s;olation of health, happi|ne&s;s,

<P>"Henry!" interpo&s;ed Sir Armine,&mdash;"let me not li&s;ten to what would, mu&s;t, and ought to turn that heart again&s;t you,&mdash;where, perhaps I ought to blu&s;h while I confe&s;s, <HI>you</HI> have been, from the hour of your birth, to this moment, the mo&s;t che|ri&s;hed of human beings!&mdash;If you have in your bo&s;om any pa&s;&s;ion, which has made its way by &s;tealth, to effect the havoc of &s;oul and body, and derange every pur&s;uit of duty, and devotion,&mdash;and, if you ra&s;hly carry the re&s;emblance of the unhappy, ill|fated object of that pa&s;&s;ion in your brea&s;t,&mdash;let the con&s;ideration you owe to the united lives and fortunes of united families,&mdash;to your religion, and to your God, who&s;e mini|&s;try you have promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t, though even that promi&s;e &s;eems forgotten,&mdash;let all the&s;e &s;acred motives aid you to expel the in|truder."</P>
<P>"I was &s;ilent, &s;ir," interrupted Henry;&mdash;"becau&s;e I could not explain:&mdash;but I did not promi&s;e&mdash;"</P>
<P>"It is &s;till in your power to derive ad|ditional
<PB N="256" REF="266">virtue from the very &s;ufferings, by which &s;uch complicated mi&s;ery to the aged, and to the young, may be prevented," re&s;umed Sir Armine.&mdash;"For my own part, I here declare to you, deare&s;t Henry, that, were my individual felicity, were my &s;ingle life, the only points of de&s;truction which would re&s;ult from what I tremble to name, I would give up that felicity, and that life, a &s;acrifice to you&mdash;a willing &s;acrifice!</P>
<P>"It is enough, my &s;on, I will not expa|tiate, I will not remon&s;trate, or rea&s;on.&mdash;Any attempt to &s;ubdue you by the force of argument, would le&s;&s;en you in your own eyes, even more, perhaps, than they would di&s;grace you in mine.&mdash;I would rather leave every thing to your own graceful duty, and good principles;&mdash;and, that I may give you an opportunity of exerting the&s;e, I thus rai&s;e you from the earth, fold you in my arms, and leave with you <HI>in tru&s;t</HI>&mdash;what?&mdash;all that ought to be mo&s;t important to you on earth."</P>
<P>In vain did Henry attempt to detain his father;&mdash;in vain did he &s;truggle in his em|braces,&mdash;in vain lift up his &s;treaming eyes,

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXXII.</HEAD>
<P>BY means &s;o apparently in&s;ignificant, was this long-delayed and long-projected di&s;covery brought about: and Sir Ar|mine was &s;trongly confirmed in all his former &s;u&s;picions, by the &s;imple circum|&s;tances of the miniature and the &s;paniel.
<Q>Thus bad begun, and wor&s;e remained behind:</Q>
<PB N="258" REF="268">for Henry had, hereby, al&s;o, more fully convinced him&s;elf that the di&s;clo&s;ure was likely to be attended, in its progre&s;s through the families, with wor&s;e mi&s;chiefs than had re&s;ulted to them or to him, even from the concealment, di&s;a&s;trous as it had been.</P>
<P>But one of the&s;e mi&s;chief-makers namely, little Fitz, was de&s;tined to be the &s;mall, but important, in&s;trument of &s;everal other di&s;coveries;&mdash;for, while Henry was in the mid&s;t of the above di&s;tre&s;&s;ing reflections, Olivia and her canine companion, with whom &s;he was, by this time, on the be&s;t terms po&s;&s;ible, returned into the breakfa&s;t parlour, where &s;he no &s;ooner perceived Henry alone, than &s;he took up the dog in her arms, and &s;aid, "Do you know, my dear Henry, that this little fellow had like to have thrown poor Jane Atwood into hy&s;terics?&mdash;He followed me into her &s;itting|room, where &s;he and your good George were t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te; and on perceiving the dog, &s;he caught him up, ki&s;&s;ed him as much as we have done, and &s;aid, 'it was the very &s;paniel that was with Mi&s;s Stuart, when
<PB N="259" REF="269">&s;he and Sir Gui&s;e paid her a vi&s;it in London, and that &s;he heard Caroline &s;ay, &s;he would not have any thing happen to it for half her father's e&s;tate;' adding, that it followed her wherever &s;he went, and &s;hared her very bed.&mdash;'But I have another rea&s;on for loving it,' &s;aid Jane. 'Pray pardon me, mi&s;s! but what is con&s;tantly in the &s;ight of&mdash;of&mdash;of an ab&s;ent friend, you know, mi&s;s, is always dear to us.'&mdash;Her he&s;itation made it difficult for her to &s;peak.</P>
<P>"I declare, Henry, when I heard the poor girl &s;ay this,&mdash;though I was &s;orry for having been the occa&s;ion of her &s;hedding tears on a &s;ubject I have con&s;tantly endea|voured to keep out of her mind,&mdash;I loved her the better for her tenderne&s;s, though I knew it was improper for her to indulge it.&mdash;Ah! I know by my own feelings," con|tinued Olivia, "that, had you but touched a flower, a leaf, or the mo&s;t trivial thing you can imagine, my fancy and heart would hold it con&s;ecrated from that moment;&mdash;and, indeed, it would be e&s;timable beyond
<PB N="260" REF="270">all price. This locket, for in&s;tance,&mdash;though that is not a well cho&s;en example either, becau&s;e it is not a trifle, and is very dear,&mdash; I have a&s;&s;ured it of my affection, a thou&s;and thou&s;and times."&mdash;Here &s;he took what &s;he de&s;cribed from her lovely bo&s;om, and forgot, mo&s;t likely, for the in&s;tant, that little Fitz was in the world.</P>
<P>"I have heard, or read, Henry," conti|nued &s;he, "that it is un&s;afe, or unwi&s;e,&mdash;&s;ome have pronounced it fooli&s;h, and philo|&s;ophers, I am told, have called it indelicate,&mdash;for a woman to expre&s;s the extent of her tenderne&s;s, to the man &s;he loves, even if he be mo&s;t amiable&mdash;Now, that has always appeared very &s;trange: for it is one of the &s;weete&s;t, I feel, likewi&s;e, it is one of the mo&s;t innocent plea&s;ures of <HI>my</HI> life, to declare how much I e&s;teem, love, and honour my deare&s;t Henry.&mdash;Where can be the peril of tru&s;ting with all his powers, the man who has long given you an equal degree of con|fidence and affection in return?&mdash;I &s;hould hate my&s;elf, if, &s;ituated as we are, I could
<PB N="261" REF="271">coldly repre&s;s a &s;entiment, the declaration of which might produce to Henry but the &s;malle&s;t added proof of my attachment.</P>
<P>"But how I am running on?&mdash;I know not whether you ought to be angry or love me the better for it.&mdash;Do &s;et me right; de|cide for me, Henry."</P>
<P>Before this que&s;tion could be replied to, True George came to &s;ay, Lieutenant Stuart was in the blue room, and begged to &s;peak to Squire Henry, before he paid his re&s;pects to the family.</P>
<P>"Run to him this moment!" replied Oli|via.&mdash;"I &s;ee, Henry, you are out of &s;pirits.&mdash;He and I will make you quite well and happy: and if he a&s;&s;i&s;ts me in doing that, I will forgive him even for robbing me of this little fellow,&mdash;for I fore&s;ee he will take him.</P>
<P>"But, alas! he is, you &s;ay, out of &s;pirits too; then I will nur&s;e and comfort you both.&mdash;Be very particular in your enquiries about Caroline, Henry.&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e he is ju&s;t come down: but you drive every thing, except your&s;elf, out of my head&mdash;I forgot that you mu&s;t have &s;een him la&s;t night at the abbey.&mdash;I wonder what he can have to
<PB N="262" REF="272">&s;ay to you alone.&mdash;Shall I leave the dog?&mdash;No&mdash;he <HI>will</HI> go with me, you &s;ee.&mdash;I declare, Caroline would be jealous of me, if &s;he were to know it.&mdash;If you had but &s;een the face of True George when Jane fondled the dog&mdash;'I have no notion of people ki&s;&s;ing puppy dogs,' muttered he:&mdash;'they could do no more to chri&s;tians.'&mdash;But &s;uppo&s;e we take off the little fellow's collar&mdash;then, you know, Sir Armine&mdash;" Henry caught at the hint,&mdash;&s;lipped the &s;trap from the buckle, and put the tell-tale in his pocket.</P>
<P>"Delightful!" cried the un&s;u&s;picious O|livia.&mdash;"Now I think we &s;hall be a match for the old gentleman's curio&s;ity. But I have forgot to look my&s;elf;&mdash;let me &s;ee!&mdash;no&mdash;now I think of it, your friend is waiting for you while I am prating." She then exultingly left the room.</P>
<P>The meeting of Charles and Henry was extremely affecting. They ran into each other's arms, and forgot, for a while, their &s;orrows in their embraces.</P>
<P>"Beloved, unhappy friend!" cried Charles,&mdash;"I feel, that even hopele&s;s love, &s;ince you mu&s;t have been innocent of my
<PB N="263" REF="273">de&s;pair, would have wanted power to di&s;|&s;olve our friend&s;hip!&mdash;Di&s;&s;olve it!&mdash;No&mdash; my poor breaking heart would rather have flown to that friend&s;hip for &s;uccour and &s;upport, as the only good it could expect in the hour of its de&s;pair!</P>
<P>"But I do <HI>not</HI> de&s;pair, Henry: for al|though I have heard, &s;een, and read all that might be di&s;tracting on this &s;ubject, my friend,"&mdash;Charles here held out a letter&mdash;"&s;till our fate is &s;u&s;pended by one precious hope&mdash;"</P>
<P>"On that letter?" que&s;tioned Henry.</P>
<P>"From my father," replied Charles.&mdash;"It propo&s;es, &mdash; in a language &s;o humi|liating, indeed, that though, as I &s;aid, all depends thereon, I am at a lo&s;s whether, as a &s;on, I ought to be the bearer&mdash;It pro|po&s;es, Henry, an accommodation between our hou&s;es, on your father's own terms.&mdash;It paints, in glowing colours, regret for our long di&s;&s;en&s;ions, and holds out a general amne&s;ty to each offending party.</P>
<P>"Whatever be the re&s;ult," continued Charles,&mdash;"the motive which led Sir Gui&s;e to this &s;ignal kindne&s;s, has more than
<PB N="264" REF="274">atoned for all that I have &s;uffered from his former conduct; and, though I greatly fear, becau&s;e I greatly love, le&s;t his generous ef|fort &s;hould be in vain,&mdash;I &s;hall remember the intention with my dying breath.&mdash;Yet, wherefore &s;hould I entertain an unworthy doubt of the &s;ucce&s;s?&mdash;If the aggre&s;&s;or can &s;ue for pardon, the man whom he has of|fended, can much more ea&s;ily forget his wrongs;&mdash;and Sir Armine Fitzorton, I tru&s;t&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Alas!" interpo&s;ed Henry, "I have to paint a &s;cene which bla&s;ts that hope in the bud."</P>
<P>He now related what had recently pa&s;t with Sir Armine, in con&s;equence of the di&s;|coveries brought about by Caroline's minia|ture, and little Fitz; and added thereto, by way of filling up the gap in their hi&s;tory, all that had fallen out to oppo&s;e the progre&s;s of their ill-fated loves, &s;ince they parted.</P>
<P>When he had clo&s;ed the narrative,&mdash;at &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages in which Charles &s;huddered with apprehen&s;ion, e&s;pecially at the proofs of Olivia's rooted attachment to his friend,
<PB N="265" REF="275">though Henry mentioned as few in&s;tances of the&s;e, and touched tho&s;e few as lightly, as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Charles exclaimed, "Notwith&s;tanding all this, &s;omething whi&s;pers me, a &s;udden and unfore&s;een good will re&s;ult from the opera|tion of this epi&s;tle on a heart &s;o noble as your father's. Con&s;ider, my friend, we live in a world of wonderful revolutions: and, among&s;t the infinity of changes and chances that &s;urround us on all hands, who can tell but from this &s;ource may &s;pring my happine&s;s with Olivia, and yours with Ca|roline?"</P>
<P>Until the mention of Caroline's name as a party in this matter, Henry, notwith|&s;tanding the con&s;titutional and habitual intemperance of all his feelings, could not help con&s;idering his friend's hopes as the mere offspring of a mind violently agitated by the pa&s;&s;ion that mo&s;t &s;trongly believes it can reconcile impo&s;&s;ibilities; but now he found out, all at once, there was much &s;ound rea&s;oning in his friend's ob&s;ervations;
<PB N="266" REF="276">and he indulged a credulity that &s;hewed he was again in a di&s;po&s;ition to believe every thing practicable, which favoured his ruling pa&s;&s;ion. He exclaimed "Oh, my friend, if the exertions of your now generous father &s;hould have influence with mine,&mdash;and if the &s;ame kind &s;tar that induced the divine Caroline to look favourably on me &s;hould di&s;po&s;e the gentle Olivia at length to incline an au&s;picious ear to the &s;uit of my friend&mdash;"</P>
<P>"O, if &s;uch bli&s;s &s;hould be in &s;tore for us!" interrupted Charles: "for I can with truth inform you, Henry, that my &s;i&s;ter's affection for you, in de&s;pite of all that has pa&s;t, is greater than&mdash;in &s;hort nothing but the returns which are made by your own heart&mdash;and the ardent and un&s;peakable ten|derne&s;s with which mine throbs for Olivia, can truly indicate how much you are be|loved by Caroline Stuart."</P>
<P>"Let us lo&s;e no time!" exclaimed Henry, with the utmo&s;t impatience. "Sir Armine ought to have had the important letter long ago. Give it me, my friend:&mdash;no,&mdash;deliver
<PB N="267" REF="277">it your&s;elf.&mdash;Yet, that may not be right.&mdash;Let us think a moment what is be&s;t to be done."</P>
<P>A gentle tap was now given at the door, on opening which, a voice, more gentle than the &s;ummons, &s;aid,&mdash;"Forgive my inter|ruption of you, dear friends: but I long to a&s;k Mr. Stuart how he does: and it is not fair of you, Henry, to keep him all to your|&s;elf in this manner, when I will an&s;wer for the whole family being rejoiced to &s;ee him,&mdash;as well as this little fellow," pointing to Fitz,&mdash;"who, you &s;ee, a&s;&s;erts his claims to a &s;hare of his company, as well as you, Mr. Henry."</P>
<P>This &s;portive reproach en&s;ured the fair &s;peaker a cordial welcome; and both the friends &s;eemed to be animated by the &s;ame &s;entiment, namely, that of making Olivia a party in the reconciliation; for they both ex|claimed, at the &s;ame in&s;tant, with very little variation in the expre&s;&s;ion, and both with equal fervour, "Good Heaven! who &s;o pro|per, &s;o likely, as Mi&s;s Clare, to a&s;&s;i&s;t us with her coun&s;el in this exigence?"</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="278">"I beg," repeated Olivia, "in&s;tantly to be made acquainted with the nature of it, if either of you &s;uppo&s;e there is a pro|bability of my being u&s;eful!" Henry, per|ceiving his friend too much agitated by the pre&s;ence of his beloved mi&s;tre&s;s to proceed, informed Olivia of Sir Gui&s;e's wi&s;h of being reconciled to the family, and his almo&s;t &s;up|plicatory letter to effect it.</P>
<P>"And who can tell, lovely creature," &s;aid Charles, almo&s;t forgetting him&s;elf, "but that, if it were pre&s;ented and &s;upported by &s;uch an advocate, it might &s;ucceed, and then&mdash;"</P>
<P>"And then," exclaimed Olivia, "it would make us three of the happie&s;t of families in the world! you know. I dare &s;ay, Mr. Stuart, your friend Henry, who, I &s;uppo&s;e, keeps nothing from you, told you my heart throbs again to embrace my ever remembered Caroline. Methinks I &s;eel for her a &s;i&s;ter's love."&mdash;"A &s;i&s;ter's!" ejaculated Charles. "Good heavens!&mdash;what a thought!&mdash;I will pledge all my hopes of happine&s;s here and hereafter, &s;he would re|joice
<PB N="269" REF="279">to call you by that endearing name!"&mdash;"Do you think &s;o?" &s;aid Olivia.&mdash;"Then we &s;hall be all as one family! and this little fellow too," added &s;he, patting the dog upon the head,&mdash;"&s;ee! here is the dear creature's &s;pa|niel! &mdash;Make much of him, Mr. Stuart.&mdash;If he could tell your &s;i&s;ter how I have fondled him,&mdash;you know the old proverb&mdash;but what have I to do with proverbs at &s;uch a time as this?&mdash;I &s;ee you are both ready to quarrel with me for loitering on my commi&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Pro&s;per it, good heaven!"</P>
<P>Give me the letter then this moment!&mdash;Give me the letter this moment!" added Olivia, taking it from the trembling Charles: "and I could almo&s;t wor&s;hip the hand of the bearer of &s;uch overtures."</P>
<P>The &s;weet girl held her own hand, in a way that would have made a novice in the little courte&s;ies of life under&s;tand that it might be &s;eized with impunity. Charles conveyed it in a di&s;ordered manner to his lips, from which Olivia drew it away, and left the room, &s;aying, "You young &s;oldiers
<PB N="270" REF="280">are &s;o u&s;ed to carry every thing by &s;torm, that the de&s;tined object of your attack has no hope of e&s;caping, when 'tis a poor dam|&s;el like my&s;elf, but by running away."</P>
<P>Now, though all this was only the play of a friendly and benevolent heart, happy at every pro&s;pect of promoting happine&s;s, and at being cho&s;en as the in&s;trument to recon|cile alienated minds, the two friends were no &s;ooner left again to a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te, than they derived, even from the alacrity of their emba&s;&s;adre&s;s, a fre&s;h &s;upply of hopes that fortune was turning in their favour.</P>
<P>Charles was too much tran&s;ported with his having, almo&s;t for the fir&s;t time, ravi&s;hed, or rather received as a free-will-offering, the beautiful hand of his mi&s;tre&s;s, to think of or feel any thing but the tumult into which it had thrown him.&mdash;He therefore only &s;eized the hand of his friend, and carrying it to that &s;ide where nature has thought pro|per to place the heart,&mdash;he cried,&mdash;"God of feeling, how it beats!&mdash;did you ever feel any thing like it, Henry?" To which que&s;|tion
<PB N="271" REF="281">his friend ob&s;erved, in the words of his favourite Shake&s;peare,
<Q>There is a tide in the affairs of men;</Q>
perhaps, Charles, we have now taken it
<Q>at the flood;</Q>
and if &s;o,
<Q>It will lead on to more than fortune.</Q></P>
<P>In hone&s;t pro&s;e, his friend a&s;&s;ured him he was almo&s;t weak enough to &s;ub&s;cribe to his opinion. They then proceeded to increa&s;e this delightful phrenzy by every means in their power. Super&s;tition it&s;elf is not more credulous than love, when, in the very bo|&s;om of de&s;pair, hope, as if by &s;tealth, darts but one ray upon it.</P>
<P>"And if, after all our di&s;appointments," cried Henry, who&s;e heart was an admirable &s;ophi&s;t, and could, when warmed, overturn the mo&s;t elaborate philo&s;ophy and rea&s;on|ing, "if, after all our mi&s;eries, this unex|pected chance &s;hould be the ground-work of that temple of felicity to which we might
<PB N="272" REF="282">at length conduct our de&s;tined brides,&mdash;&s;hall we not&mdash;?"</P>
<P>"Shall we not both go out of our &s;en&s;es with joy?" que&s;tioned Charles. "Brides! O Henry! how often have we known one happy change lead on, and prove as it were the harbinger to, another! And when For|tune <HI>does</HI> bring her atonements, &s;he is fre|quently, like a long tyrannous but at length yielding mi&s;tre&s;s, as kind as &s;he had been cruel."</P>
<P>The &s;elf-deluding friends then enume|rated all the in&s;tances their memories could furni&s;h of one unexpected piece of good luck producing or having been followed up by others no le&s;s unlooked for. Charles re|lated a &s;tory of two young people coming to|gether, who&s;e parents, friends, and fortunes, were all in oppo&s;ition to their deare&s;t hopes.</P>
<P>Henry, bringing the matter more into point, &s;aid, he had read &s;omewhere the hi&s;|tory of a lady in love with a gentleman who&s;e heart was otherwi&s;e engaged; notwith|&s;tanding which, after a cour&s;e of hopele&s;s years, &s;he was married to the object of her af|fections,
<PB N="273" REF="283">by an accident that had induced the gentleman to transfer his pa&s;&s;ion from his former love.</P>
<P>"And why &s;hould not this be the ultimate event in the ca&s;e of Charles and Olivia?"</P>
<P>Such was the romance of their hearts, that they could not &s;top, or indeed &s;toop, to ex|amine whether this was not a mere rhap&s;ody of the affections in the hey-day of youth|ful blood. Indeed, the wi&s;dom of rea&s;on and of common &s;en&s;e is &s;o unwelcome and di&s;gu&s;ting to lovers of this character when the heart is in this &s;ort of delirium, that it &s;in|cerely adopts the maxim of the poet, by pronouncing it "folly to be wi&s;e."</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="33" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XXXIII.</HEAD>
<P>To this delu&s;ion of a fond and love-&s;ick imagination, then, did Henry and his friend deliver them&s;elves up &s;o entirely, that they had &s;ketched out, and communicated to each other, &s;everal of the delicious plans of happine&s;s which, it was agreed upon, &s;hould
<PB N="274" REF="284">take place when Charles became the hu&s;|band of Olivia, and Henry of Caroline. The &s;oul of poe&s;y was at work in the bo&s;om of Henry. His fancy performed miracles. His head and heart were both on fire. The enraptured Charles caught the flame; and both enjoyed
<Q>Tho&s;e painted clouds that beautify our days;</Q> while rea&s;on, half-blu&s;hing half-&s;miling, withdrew; and that &s;pecies of madne&s;s, which indeed can never endure &s;o &s;tern a power, re&s;umed its reign. The pro&s;pect of felicity &s;eemed to approximate as our young friends looked upon it, and to brighten as it advanced: all the impediments which had &s;o long &s;tood like a dead wall of &s;eparation betwixt the abbey and ca&s;tle, were, by the help of reconciling fancy, removed; and in its &s;tead 'a verdant wall,' like that of pa|radi&s;e, up-reared its florid head. The turrets &s;eemed to &s;mile on each other,&mdash;the trees on each e&s;tate appeared once more to form their branches into true-lover's knots, and
<PB N="275" REF="285">extend their 'marriageable arms' till they embraced both hou&s;es: the very flowers of the different gardens were, as by in&s;tinctive amity, di&s;po&s;ed to waft fragrance to each other, '&s;tealing and giving odours:' and that this courte&s;y might be the more expe|ditiou&s;ly done, Henry's mu&s;e was command|ed to create a Zephyr on purpo&s;e, com|mi&s;&s;ioned to bear upon his balmy wing the ro&s;y &s;weets of Fitzorton to the abbey, and with no le&s;s celerity to fly back with the violet perfumes of Stuart. Meantime, Hen|ry had &s;tationed the Loves and Graces, of which he had a warehou&s;e, in different parts of the groves and gardens, to twi&s;t flowers and wreathe chaplets, to adorn the brows of Caroline and Olivia. Nay, he had placed Cupid in one part of the fore&s;t, aiming a new dart at the tender bo&s;om of Olivia, in favour of Charles, and had &s;et old Hymen at work, in the &s;acred form of Sir Armine, to build a nuptial bower to be ready for that double marriage which was to complete &s;uch in|finity of happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Should&s;t thou, reader, be either a poet,
<PB N="276" REF="286">a lover, or both, thou wilt here exclaim, "if this be madne&s;s let me rave!"&mdash;but, if thou art a rea&s;oning being, and wi&s;e, that is, cold enough to keep the track of com|mon &s;en&s;e, thou wilt pity or de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e di&s;tracted day-dreamers, and not being able to conceive any happine&s;s in &s;uch phrenzy, think Bedlam, or St. Luke's, the only places proper to hold our two frantic young gen|tlemen.</P>
<P>Now as the frozen Cauca&s;us and the burning Aetna do really exi&s;t in the natural world, &s;o do the&s;e oppo&s;ite degrees of heat and cold in the human temperament;&mdash;and as it would be no le&s;s impo&s;&s;ible to con|vince thee of even the tran&s;itory rapture of being mentally di&s;tracted, than to per|&s;uade the man of &s;anguine di&s;po&s;ition,&mdash;a Charles or a Henry,&mdash;there was infinite gra|tification in carrying a lump of unthawed ice in the bo&s;om by way of a heart,&mdash;we &s;hall attempt no means of reconciling &s;uch extremes,&mdash;&s;atisfied in our own mind, that inten&s;e heat and cold have their &s;eparate and peculiar u&s;e in the little globe of man's na|ture,
<PB N="277" REF="287">&mdash;no le&s;s than in that great globe, the world it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Thou knowe&s;t, reader, that Greenland is a perfect bagnio to the temperature of the pla|net Saturn, to whom the &s;un him&s;elf ap|pears but as a little pallid &s;tar, and that its inhabitants would expire with heat in our colde&s;t countries;&mdash;while, on the other hand, Mercury is &s;o full of fire, that the heat to which its &s;uppo&s;ed natives are accu&s;tomed, is &s;o ex|ce&s;&s;ive, that the mo&s;t glorious day here would be to them no more than declining twilight, and they would be frozen to death in the torrid zone.&mdash;If thou art <HI>&s;aturnine,</HI> therefore, thou wilt not he&s;itate to pro|nounce our <HI>mercurial</HI> &s;parks ab&s;olutely mad, and &s;it only to live in that planet which has been called the bedlam of the &s;pheres.</P>
<P>Yet, grudge not Henry or his friend the momentary bli&s;s they derived from this flame of their fancy, although it may have raged in contra&s;t with thy more &s;ober mat|ter-of-fact &s;en&s;ations.&mdash;It was but as a meteor of the night, that appeared and pa&s;&s;|ed away, making the darkne&s;s that followed,
<PB N="278" REF="288">the more horrible, from the gleam and its coru&s;cations.&mdash;Alas! while the&s;e children of imagination were triumphing in the vi&s;ionary happine&s;s that blazed about their eyes, rea|&s;on and common &s;en&s;e, a&s;&s;uming &s;oon the &s;hapes of a father and mother, entered the apartment.&mdash;Sir Armine held the opened letter of Sir Gui&s;e in his hand;&mdash;"I &s;up|po&s;e," &s;aid he, addre&s;&s;ing the youths,&mdash;"you are both acquainted with the contents: your friend&s;hip, no doubt, indulges unlimited confidence; and I take it for granted, what|ever is imparted to one, is, in effect, com|municated to both."</P>
<P>Upon Henry's a&s;&s;uring him he had not &s;een the letter, and that his friend had only partially mentioned the general purport, Sir Armine gave it to Henry, de&s;iring him to read it aloud.</P>

<P>THIS method of beginning may indicate the friendly di&s;po&s;ition under which
<PB N="279" REF="289">I write.&mdash;Both our &s;ons, as well as our&s;elves, are the victims of our antipathy.&mdash;They have pleaded &s;o often for our reconcile|ment, that I am unable any longer to re&s;i&s;t their amicable interce&s;&s;ions.&mdash;The bond of union may perhaps, through the medium of our children, be yet more cemented be|tween our families after this reconciliation, than if no fatal breach had ever happened.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>"What does that mean?" que&s;tioned Lady Fitzorton, looking at Henry.</P>
<P>Henry directed his eyes to Charles for the materials of an an&s;wer,&mdash;but, not finding any, was &s;ilent and embarra&s;&s;ed; for Charles was at that in&s;tant con&s;ulting, for a like rea&s;on, the countenance of Henry.</P>
<P>"Proceed with the letter," &s;aid Sir Ar|mine.</P>
<P>"But more powerful advocates than even our &s;ons have pleaded for putting an end to our family feuds.&mdash;Con&s;cious feelings, my good neighbour, urge me to &s;eek reconciliation.&mdash;I have lifted&mdash;O it was foul! my hand again&s;t mine ancient friend!
<PB N="280" REF="290">and I could even humble my unworthy &s;elf in the du&s;t of the earth."</P>
<P>"Should that have been &s;aid,&mdash;at lea&s;t in that groveling way,&mdash;by the father of a &s;oldier?" a&s;ked Sir Armine, darting his eye on Charles.</P>
<P>Charles blu&s;hed.</P>
<P>"Young &s;oldier," &s;aid Sir Armine, "let us quit this letter! it will agonize you more than any wounds you could receive in the defence of your country. I de&s;ire to conver&s;e with you on another &s;ubject.&mdash;Directly and at once, therefore, I &s;hall demand of you, in the pre&s;ence of my wife who has an equal intere&s;t in the matter, whether you have any knowledge of a corre&s;pondence which is &s;aid to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between your &s;i&s;ter Mi&s;s Stuart, and your friend here?"</P>
<P>"He has, Sir," an&s;wered Henry, re|lieving Charles, who &s;tood irre&s;olute.&mdash;"He has the mo&s;t perfect knowledge of it, and has done his utmo&s;t to&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Not to promote it, certainly?" inter|rupted Sir Armine.&mdash;"He is of an honour|able
<PB N="281" REF="291">profe&s;&s;ion, and incapable of clande&s;tine ba&s;ene&s;s."</P>
<P>"Ba&s;ene&s;s, Sir!" exclaimed Charles red|dening.</P>
<P>"Yes, young man," returned Sir Armine.&mdash;"It would be the la&s;t exce&s;s of ba&s;ene&s;s to aid and abet an intercour&s;e which would render every individual of this hou&s;e, except that ra&s;h boy, unhappy, and make him un|grateful and infamous. You are aware of your friend's &s;olemn engagements to Olivia:&mdash;but he neglects her!&mdash;his friends!&mdash;his relations!&mdash;his God!"</P>
<P>"Solemn engagements, Sir!" exclaimed Henry:&mdash;"I know not of any I ever made to that lady: they have all been taken for granted:&mdash;and whatever may be the i&s;&s;ue, I here di&s;claim them;&mdash;I here declare, that my whole &s;oul is, has been, and &s;hall for ever be, betrothed only to Caroline Stuart,&mdash;even as firmly, and irrevocably as is that of my friend Charles to&mdash;"</P>
<P>Henry checked him&s;elf a moment, and then proceeded&mdash;</P>
<P>"Yes! wherefore &s;hould a virtuous but
<PB N="282" REF="292">unfortunate pa&s;&s;ion be thus hid from tho&s;e who ought earlier to have known it?"</P>
<P>Lady Fitzorton, perceiving the emotions of Sir Armine were &s;welling into one of tho&s;e dreadful extremities that &s;ometimes tyrannized his bo&s;om, would have drawn him out of the room, and made &s;igns of &s;ilence to Henry, who too much &s;tirred to regard them with his u&s;ual re&s;pect, exclaimed,&mdash;"No, madam! &s;ilence has already wrought this mighty complication of mi&s;chief and mi&s;take."</P>
<P>"Let me hear all! let me hear all!" cries Sir Armine, his articulation almo&s;t buried in his &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>"It is heard in a &s;entence," replied Hen|ry, throwing him&s;elf at his mother's feet.&mdash;"The &s;i&s;ter of my friend is not more pre|cious to your &s;on, than is Olivia Clare to&mdash;</P>
<P>"To whom?" que&s;tioned Sir Armine, &s;taring wildly, and &s;tammering violently.</P>
<P>"To the unhappy wretch who now throws him&s;elf upon your mercy," an&s;wered Charles, falling on his knees before Sir Ar|mine.&mdash;"Mi&s;erable that I am!&mdash;the flame
<PB N="283" REF="293">has long been con&s;uming my vitals; and the life and death of us all depend upon &s;ome &s;udden changes in our favour."</P>
<P>"A &s;udden change will &s;oon take place," exclaimed Lady Fitzorton.&mdash;"Look at my poor hu&s;band! you have already deprived him of &s;peech!&mdash;you will de&s;troy him be|tween you! but his death &s;hall be upon your heads!"</P>
<P>"I &s;hall not die," &s;aid Sir Armine, exerting him&s;elf after a deep &s;truggle that &s;hook his venerable frame, as if he were contending with death him&s;elf:&mdash;"I will not die! the young a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins &s;hall not have that &s;atisfaction."&mdash;He pau&s;ed for breath.</P>
<P>"Then I am to under&s;tand, Sir," conti|nued Sir Armine, recovering his utterance, and &s;taggering towards Charles, "that you and my &s;on have availed your&s;elves of my permi&s;&s;ion to carry on your friend&s;hip for each other, independent of my ju&s;t re|&s;entment <HI>el&s;ewhere,</HI>&mdash;I &s;ay I am to under|&s;tand&mdash;"</P>
<P>"No, Sir!" interpo&s;ed Charles, &s;till keep|ing his humble po&s;ture,&mdash;"I have never yet
<PB N="284" REF="294">dared to breathe my unhappy pa&s;&s;ion for Mi&s;s Clare, to her&s;elf, or to any other per&s;on but my friend, till within the&s;e few hours. Even the &s;i&s;ter of my heart, from whom nothing was ever &s;hut out before, did not &s;u&s;pect it."</P>
<P>"That is &s;till &s;omething," an&s;wered Sir Armine, in a tone much &s;oftened.</P>
<P>Henry, &s;till kneeling, perceived the fa|vourable moment, and applied his whole artillery of moving eloquence, in the cau&s;e of him&s;elf and friend.&mdash;He briefly recapitu|lated the mo&s;t important parts of the my&s;te|rious hi&s;tory of their unhappy loves,&mdash;he &s;et the honour, genero&s;ity, and heroic virtues of Charles, in the mo&s;t affecting points of view, and concluded his harangue, by ob&s;erving, while he held the lieutenant by the hand,&mdash;that if his father and mother were di&s;|po&s;ed to prevent unheard-of horror from overwhelming all parties, it could be done only by devi&s;ing &s;ome means to bring about the double nuptials, on which they had &s;et their hearts;&mdash;"any thing &s;hort of which," &s;ays Henry, "I fore&s;ee, will bring
<PB N="285" REF="295">de&s;olation upon the three hou&s;es,&mdash;de&s;ola|tion, which, as an earthquake, &s;hall &s;wallow them.</P>
<P>Lady Fitzorton, who&s;e affections were much moved, tenderly wept over the young men.</P>
<P>Sir Armine gave a hand to each of the youths, and rai&s;ing them up, addre&s;&s;ed them, trembling as he &s;pake, yet his manner and tone of voice determined.</P>
<P>"Su&s;pect your enemy when he brings gifts; and have a doubly guarded eye upon your ancient foe, when he &s;uddenly changes his frowns into &s;miles, are long e&s;tabli&s;hed maxims.&mdash;How far the&s;e are applicable to Sir Gui&s;e Stuart in his laboured profe&s;&s;ions, I pre&s;ume not to &s;ay.&mdash;As for you, Charles, when I have told you, that, added to former impediments, you mu&s;t pa&s;s to the arms of Olivia Clare through the blood of her father, my own, and the life of this af|flicted woman,&mdash;I &s;hall point to you the alternative of an honourable action, which will ju&s;tify the tru&s;t I have long repo&s;ed in
<PB N="286" REF="296">your a&s;&s;ertions, however I may &s;u&s;pect the a&s;&s;everation of others."</P>
<P>Charles eagerly de&s;ired a farther explana|tion.</P>
<P>"Save us, dear youth,&mdash;&s;ave your&s;elf, your &s;i&s;ter, and your bo&s;om friend," &s;aid Sir Ar|mine,&mdash;"by retreating from, if you cannot conquer, a pa&s;&s;ion, which it is impo&s;&s;ible, without violating every law of friend&s;hip and ho&s;pitality, to indulge,&mdash;nay, which, were it &s;anctioned by our united &s;uffrages and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, could not pro&s;per with Olivia, who&s;e happine&s;s and life are contracted to your friend."</P>
<P>Charles fetched a deep &s;igh, and &s;hook his head, as if to expre&s;s at once the diffi|culty of complying with the reque&s;t, and the too evident &s;trength of argument in the ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>"Having done this," continued Sir Ar|mine,&mdash;"your virtue will be complete; for you will have done all that in you lies to alienate this infatuated boy from farther pur&s;uit of a &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e very tenderne&s;s, in
<PB N="287" REF="297">this ca&s;e, calls upon you to re&s;cue her from her&s;elf;&mdash;for ina&s;much as &s;he loves, mu&s;t &s;he be wretched,&mdash;as it is no le&s;s impo&s;&s;ible for her to be married to my &s;on, than for you to wed Mr. Clare's daughter,&mdash;unle&s;s at the &s;acrifice of every thing in this world, that ought mo&s;t to be valued by an hone&s;t man."</P>
<P>Perceiving Charles was ab&s;orbed in grief, and that Henry was about to &s;peak&mdash;</P>
<P>"As to you, Henry, I have to trouble you with a very few words:&mdash;let not your friend, who, I &s;ee, is contending with him&s;elf, but who&s;e virtue will triumph in the end,&mdash;let him not &s;urpa&s;s you.&mdash;Emulate him.&mdash;Your parents, aged and infirm, are before you.&mdash;Your union with Mi&s;s Stuart would de|&s;troy both, would murder Olivia, and there|fore make Caroline far more wretched, than the di&s;appointment of her pa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Dear&mdash;dear &s;on,&mdash;child of my heart,&mdash;mo&s;t favoured,&mdash;mo&s;t precious,&mdash;&s;ave your family! &mdash;you know not half the claims, that Olivia has upon you, though you know they
<PB N="288" REF="298">are manifold.&mdash;I will not, in this moment, di&s;gui&s;e that her father has pre&s;erved yours, pre&s;erved him from unexpected but utter ruin,&mdash;from impri&s;onment!&mdash;Behold, your weeping mother is borne down with &s;or|row, with love, with gratitude:&mdash;behold &s;he kneels, kneels to her &s;on:&mdash;your fa|ther joins her petitions, in a po&s;ture no le&s;s &s;uppliant:&mdash;mu&s;t we both &s;upplicate in vain?&mdash;alas! look upon us, my &s;on!"</P>
<P>The venerable pair were almo&s;t &s;uffocated with their &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>Charles rai&s;ed Lady Fitzorton.</P>
<P>Henry lifted his father from the ground into his arms, exclaiming, as he held him in his embrace,&mdash;"Live! live, my father!&mdash;let me alone be the &s;acrifice!&mdash;it &s;hall be &s;o!&mdash;mo&s;t willingly will I be the victim.&mdash;Do with me as you both &s;ee fit!" (here he embraced his mother) "di&s;po&s;e of my hand, my life, to your wi&s;h:&mdash;I will not murmur. No de&s;tiny, no agony, can equal what I at this moment feel at &s;eeing you in &s;uch a &s;ituation. And yet my friend,&mdash;my poor friend&mdash;"</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="299">Henry left his mother, and ran into the open arms of Charles.</P>
<P>"Take no thought of me!" exclaimed his friend: "I cannot bear to witne&s;s, much le&s;s to create, a &s;cene like that which yet pierces my &s;oul.&mdash;I will bani&s;h my&s;elf for ever.&mdash;My own &s;word &s;hould end me, if I could be the cau&s;e of &s;uch another, to tho&s;e who ought to have &s;hut the door which they threw wide open to give me welcome!"</P>
<P>"Sir!&mdash;Madam," continued Charles, "as Olivia knows not yet of my unhappy love, I here &s;wear to you,&mdash;although it may, and I hope it will break my heart,&mdash;I &s;wear never&mdash;never&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Charles," an&s;wered Sir Armine,&mdash;"I will have you bound only by the &s;acred ties of your own rea&s;on, friend&s;hip, and honour:&mdash;and thus, from my inmo&s;t &s;oul, do I pour out my thanks."</P>
<P>"In which are included," &s;aid Lady Fitz|orton, "my heart-felt acknowledgments."</P>
<P>"My hou&s;e is your own:" cries Sir Ar|mine. "When your vi&s;its afflict you, or interrupt the generous ta&s;k you have im|po&s;ed
<PB N="290" REF="300">on your&s;elf, you &s;hall be free to depart unque&s;tioned; and whenever you return, our &s;miles &s;hall welcome you.&mdash;Neither &s;hall Henry be re&s;trained from the abbey:&mdash;We &s;ubmit him to your protection, to the guard of his own duty, wi&s;dom, and virtue, and to the &s;acred office for which he will now again prepare his head and heart:&mdash;we yield him to the coun&s;els of Caroline Stuart her&s;elf, who, from tho&s;e traits of character and conduct you have at different times related, will, I am &s;ure, when you explain to her more fully <HI>our</HI> &s;ituations, help us,&mdash;even again&s;t her&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Another word, and I have done," ad|ded Sir Armine:&mdash;"the care with which the fatal my&s;teries that have entangled us, has been guarded from Olivia and her fa|ther, my be&s;t benefactor, my <HI>pre&s;erver,</HI>&mdash;I con&s;ider as more than chance,&mdash;as provi|dence.&mdash;If the peace of innocence be dear, oh! be jealous of dropping a hint that may lead to any di&s;covery of what has pa&s;t between us this day.&mdash;But let us part: we may be &s;urpri&s;ed.&mdash;Do not be &s;een at pre|&s;ent,
<PB N="291" REF="301">Henry! and do you, dear Charles, take to your father my be&s;t acknowledgments of his letter, to which I will return an early an&s;wer:&mdash;it &s;hall be &s;uch, I pledge my&s;elf, as is con&s;i&s;tent with the new &s;y&s;tem of good|will, I hope mutually &s;incere, that again &s;ub|&s;i&s;ts between us:&mdash;but in the mean-time, I wi&s;h you both to peru&s;e this paper, and to give me, when opportunity favours, your joint opinion of it."</P>
<P>"Hu&s;h! I think I heard Olivia's voice," &s;aid Lady Fitzorton.&mdash;"I got her to write &s;ome vi&s;iting cards for our next week's an|nual party, thinking &s;he might be &s;ecurely employed in that manner, while our con|ver&s;ation, which, I fore&s;aw, would be in|tere&s;ting, la&s;ted:&mdash;perhaps &s;he has fini&s;hed, and is returning."</P>
<P>"Let us &s;eparate," &s;aid Sir Armine, who led Lady Fitzorton out of the room, leaving Charles and Henry again together.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXXIV.</HEAD>
<P>DEPRIVED for &s;ome time of the power of &s;peaking to each other, Henry and Charles could only expre&s;s by &s;igns, a mutual de&s;ire of peru&s;ing the paper left in their hands. Henry opened it, and found the obligation mentioned by his fa|ther.</P>
<P>It con&s;i&s;ted in Mr. Clare's having ad|vanced no le&s;s a &s;um than fifty thou&s;and pounds, to replace the amount of what Sir Armine had lo&s;t within the pa&s;t week, by the failure of a banker who&s;e credit he had generou&s;ly attempted to &s;ave in the hour of an exigence that threatened de&s;truction to him&s;elf and a whole family.</P>
<P>To prevent this threatened ruin, Sir Ar|mine, who had been long in friend&s;hip with the banker, put him&s;elf to the la&s;t difficulty, but had &s;carce effected the accommodation before the banker was declared in&s;olvent; and the news getting air, the per&s;on of whom Sir Armine borrowed the money,
<PB N="293" REF="303">made &s;udden claim for a return of the &s;um, which was only borrowed for one and twenty days, to cover &s;udden lo&s;&s;es which the banker had him&s;elf &s;u&s;tained. In this extremity Sir Armine confided the ca&s;e to Mr. Clare, who immediately depo&s;ited the money, in&s;i&s;ting it &s;hould not be con&s;idered as any part of Olivia's independent fortune, but what it had been his &s;olemn de&s;ign, out of his di&s;tinct property, to leave to his olde&s;t, deare&s;t friend, in ca&s;e he &s;hould be his &s;urvivor, and if not, to be divided equally between his young friends, James and John.</P>
<P>Mr. Clare had farther &s;aid, "that as Sir Armine had informed him he had no way of paying off the &s;um borrowed, but by trench|ing on tho&s;e independencies, which, though duteou&s;ly &s;urrendered, he knew his old friend con&s;idered only as a more &s;olemn tru&s;t:&mdash;the advance of what he (Mr. Clare) had <HI>willed</HI> to be pre&s;ented after death, would better be offered now; which, "you know my friend," added Mr. Clare,&mdash;"will give me an opportunity of &s;eeing an important
<PB N="294" REF="304">article of my la&s;t will and te&s;tament per|formed in my life-time,&mdash;be&s;ides making Olivia one of the happie&s;t girls in the world; for to tell you the truth, this is one of her plans, after I had thrice refu&s;ed the offer of her own fortune: but that, I have determined, mu&s;t come clear to one whom I have long con&s;idered as her hu&s;band."</P>
<P>Both the young men were greatly affect|ed at this act of genero&s;ity on the part of Mr. Clare, and were not &s;o blinded by their pa&s;&s;ion, as not to feel it was a natural and &s;trong, though not, perhaps, altogether ju&s;|tifiable inducement in Mr. Fitzorton, to promote the match between Henry and Oli|via:&mdash;for indeed, there is not any degree of family di&s;tre&s;s, though it may be pleaded as a palliative, can be admitted as a ju&s;tifica|tion.</P>
<P>Following, therefore, the impul&s;e of a &s;imilar &s;en&s;ation, they mutually deplored the cruel de&s;tiny which did not give them an apparent pretence to cen&s;ure the event of which they were to be the victims.&mdash;On the contrary, they &s;eemed to catch the
<PB N="295" REF="305">&s;pirit of chivalry which characterized the action of the good old Clare; and, warm|ing by degrees, they worked them&s;elves up to &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of the conduct they ought to pur&s;ue, that each re&s;olved to &s;trong then the other, to the performance of the promi&s;e made to Sir Armine and Lady Fitzor|ton.</P>
<P>And thus, for a time, in this well-con|ducted victory over them&s;elves, they forgot that they were &s;till pa&s;&s;ionate lovers.</P>
<P>Alas! how nature plays with her chil|dren! She &s;eems to rank them even among&s;t her &s;ports.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of all this heroi&s;m, a &s;mall circum&s;tance happened, to convince the he|roes that theoretical and practical philo|&s;ophy are &s;omewhat different.</P>
<P>Charles had a glimp&s;e of Olivia, and Henry of Caroline's little &s;paniel, exactly as they had &s;ettled their point of re&s;olution.&mdash;The &s;ight of the&s;e objects &s;hook the goodly fabric which imagination had reared in their hearts; and, from the pride of victors, they &s;unk, in a moment, to the condition of
<PB N="296" REF="306">the captive that had only been dreaming he was free.</P>
<P>"Mu&s;t I re&s;ign thee, beautiful Olivia?" &s;ighed Charles:&mdash;"mu&s;t I then relinqui&s;h the very hope of thy ever being mine?"</P>
<P>"O thou envied little animal!" ex|claimed Henry to the &s;paniel,&mdash;"how wilt thou be fondled by my &s;oul's dear Caroline, while I&mdash;mu&s;t no more indulge the thought, even that I am beloved!"</P>
<P>Then, as if by &s;ympathy, both the youths embracing, they came to another &s;ettled point, namely, that they were a couple of mi&s;erable fellows, who had nothing left in the world that took the &s;hape of con&s;ola|tion, but that one was as wretched, as the other;&mdash;a conclu&s;ion, which, though not perhaps &s;trictly generous, has been often thought comfortable,&mdash;proceeding, po&s;&s;i|bly, from a &s;ocial idea; for few can bear to be happy or &s;orrowful alone.</P>
<P>Olivia and her canine companion &s;oon joined the young gentlemen.&mdash;She was de|lighted to &s;ee them hand in hand, which &s;he con&s;idered as the re&s;ult of their mutual hap|pine&s;s.
<PB N="297" REF="307">&mdash;Her &s;paniel, enraptured to behold two of his be&s;t friends, leaped alternately upon them, with every demon&s;tration of gratitude and joy, but more e&s;pecially upon Henry, who, we believe, was, of the two, the greater favourite: and Henry, in turn, received him with undimini&s;hed affection, and, indeed, appeared to be, either for his own &s;ake or &s;ome other per&s;on's, more fond of him than ever.</P>
<P>Olivia, with an air of plea&s;antry, coun|terfeiting mortification, declared that "&s;he &s;hould now, in reality, be jealous, and would, therefore, the le&s;s reluctantly &s;uf|fer Charles to take her rival back to his mi&s;tre&s;s: "For," &s;aid &s;he to Charles,&mdash;"you &s;ee plainly, the little &s;educer receives Henry's fir&s;t attentions; and I &s;hall pre|&s;ently be but a &s;econdary object.&mdash;To con|fe&s;s the truth," &s;aid Olivia,&mdash;"I am a little jealous of you too, Mr. Stuart; for you and your friend, in your la&s;t interview with Sir Armine and Lady Fitzorton,&mdash;who, by the bye, in&s;idiou&s;ly kept me out of their party,&mdash;have contrived to run away with their
<PB N="298" REF="308">hearts, in a manner that throws poor Oli|via and the re&s;t of the family in &s;hadow, quite into the back ground of our dome&s;tic groupe&mdash;Nothing now, for&s;ooth! but the prai&s;es of the two in&s;eparables, Henry and Charles, has for the la&s;t half hour been heard through the ca&s;tle!&mdash;'They are the be&s;t, the noble&s;t young men in the world,' &s;ays the old lady. &mdash; 'Excellent youths!' cries the old gentleman.&mdash;Why what have you done to de&s;erve all the&s;e fine things?&mdash;But do not tell me.&mdash;I hate &s;ecrets.&mdash;The knowledge of them would only &s;erve to increa&s;e my jealou&s;y; for I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hould have the mortification to find you have done every thing to effect the charming reconci|liation, which, I find, is to take place be|tween our families; and I have been only the letter-carrier, you the amba&s;&s;adors!&mdash;And you are to know, I am of &s;o perver&s;e a di&s;po&s;ition, that I quarrel with the happi|ne&s;s of my be&s;t friends, unle&s;s I have been &s;ome way, aye, and <HI>importantly,</HI> the me|dium."</P>
<P>The friends con&s;ulted each other's looks.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="309">"Yes, you may plot, and lay your wi&s;e heads together, again&s;t a poor feeble wo|man," re&s;umed Olivia:&mdash;"but I will have my revenge yet, and with intere&s;t too;&mdash;for, when we are all again as we &s;hould be, I am determined there &s;hall not happen a &s;ingle thought or word that &s;hall make any one of us wi&s;h to part again, except under the a&s;&s;urance of a &s;peedy return to each other, for the re&s;t of our lives.&mdash;So, that being the ca&s;e, I &s;hall now go to your father and mother, whom I left in the gar|den, Mr. Henry,&mdash;and &s;ee if I can get back <HI>&s;ome</HI> of my &s;tolen goods&mdash;a little bit of their hearts again.</P>
<P>"Meantime," added &s;he, as &s;he was quit|ing the apartment,&mdash;"do not forget, Mr. Stuart, to tell your &s;i&s;ter, that if &s;he be but half as happy as I am at the pro&s;pect of our amicable a&s;&s;ociation, &s;he will be <HI>almo&s;t</HI> as ble&s;&s;ed as I wi&s;h her to be,&mdash;not that I &s;hould be quite contented till &s;he was as happy as my&s;elf either.&mdash;As to you, little Mr. Fitz,&mdash;but you know my mind already, and &s;o this parting care&s;s, and adieu, &s;ir."</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="310">Little is that reader &s;killed in the hi&s;|tory of the human heart, who cannot &s;ug|ge&s;t to him&s;elf the additional dilemma into which the two friends were thrown by this animated harangue.</P>
<P>When Olivia had departed, Henry caught hold of little Fitz, and turning to his friend, ob&s;erved, "From the bottom of my &s;oul, my unhappy Charles, I regret that you and I ever came into the world!"</P>
<P>"Would to heaven, we were both out of it, my dear Henry!" an&s;wered Charles.</P>
<P>"If we were both dead, all would be very well," &s;aid Henry.</P>
<P>"You are perfectly in the right," an|&s;wered Charles.</P>
<P>Henry &s;eemed &s;olemnly to recur to a &s;u&s;|pended idea. The expre&s;&s;ions were trite, and, if con&s;idered as the language of de|&s;pairing lovers, are ludicrous and unmean|ing:&mdash;but, on the part of Henry, they be|trayed the image that was but too deeply rooted in his mind.</P>
<P>The lie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tenant, after a mournful pau&s;e, ob&s;erved that, "as, either way, they mu&s;t
<PB N="301" REF="311">be both mi&s;erable, it would be better for only two per&s;ons to &s;uffer, than to increa&s;e the number of victims." Hereupon Henry, who had been holding the &s;ilken ears of Ca|roline's &s;paniel to his cheek, and wiping away the tears which had dropt upon them, very gravely demanded of Charles, "What was his opinion of &s;uicide?"</P>
<P>"To &s;peak of it profe&s;&s;ionally, I think it the wor&s;t &s;ort of de&s;ertion, and flying one's country," an&s;wered Charles.&mdash;"To &s;peak of it morally, I feel it to be &s;inful:&mdash;in &s;orrow, as in joy, &s;uch have ever been my &s;enti|ments.&mdash;I wi&s;h we were both in our graves, my friend, with all my &s;oul: but I do not hold it right to gratify this wi&s;h by &s;horten|ing our lives. Death would be a ble&s;&s;ing: but could it be purcha&s;ed by an action ac|cur&s;ed?"</P>
<P>Henry gave a &s;ort of di&s;&s;entient &s;hake of the head, but dropt the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>"I can endure this hou&s;e no longer at pre&s;ent," &s;aid Charles,&mdash;"and will there|fore go home,&mdash;but without any hope of greater happine&s;s when I get there."</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="312">"I will attend you&mdash;part&mdash;of&mdash;the way," &s;ays Henry, &s;tammeringly dividing his &s;en|tence.</P>
<P>They went out, and little Fitz was &s;till in the arms of Henry. Scarce had they reached the park, when Charles a&s;ked, "Whether the family would not think it &s;omewhat rude to go without his taking leave?&mdash;Very ill bred, certainly! do not you think &s;o, my dear Henry?"&mdash;and he was walking again to|wards the hou&s;e, without waiting for Hen|ry's reply. Then, as if changing his mind, he turned and took the path to the abbey, &s;aying, with a dejected voice, "it was not material."</P>
<P>They now walked arm in arm, and little Fitz, being &s;et down, ranged the hedge|rows, and traver&s;ed the grounds,&mdash;far the happie&s;t being of the trio.</P>
<P>They &s;oon gained the never-to-be-for|gotten grand avenue, from which the ab|bey and the ca&s;tle could be viewed di&s;tinct|ly in all their parts.&mdash;It would be no ea&s;y matter to decide, whether Henry gazed more earne&s;tly at the one, or Charles at the
<PB N="303" REF="313">other. They both &s;tood fixed, midway be|twixt both edifices, employing them&s;elves with the view of objects in the mo&s;t oppo|&s;ite directions; and, after feeding their &s;e|parate unhappine&s;s by all tho&s;e tender thoughts which they had re&s;olved, but a few minutes before, to con&s;ider as the for|bidden fruit of their heart, and therefore never to be ta&s;ted.</P>
<P>Charles declared, "That this nur&s;ing an unfortunate pa&s;&s;ion was extremely wrong; and, if they were wi&s;e, they were now taking their la&s;t look of the devoted ca&s;tle, and the ill-fated abbey."</P>
<P>"Very true," &s;aid Henry:&mdash;"here then let us&mdash;yes&mdash;after we have taken another look, let us &s;eparate&mdash;at lea&s;t for the pre|&s;ent. &mdash;No,"&mdash;added he,&mdash;"I will go with you, my friend, ju&s;t as far as tho&s;e trees on the left&mdash;for there&mdash;and then&mdash;and then&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Yes," ob&s;erved Charles, gazing.</P>
<P>"True, my friend, and&mdash;th&mdash;the&mdash;then&mdash;"</P>
<P>Henry ab&s;olutely &s;tuttered, and was drag|ging at the arm of Charles, as he &s;poke;&mdash;
<PB N="304" REF="314">Charles, in the &s;ame degree, hanging back, as the other pre&s;&s;ed forwards. Ju&s;t as this &s;ee-&s;aw &s;ituation ended, Charles recollected he had left his &s;tick at the ca&s;tle, but pro|te&s;ted, "He would not lo&s;e it for the world. It was a gift."&mdash;One of his gloves too was mi&s;&s;ing.&mdash;This, indeed, he had, the in&s;tant before, taken off and put into his pocket.&mdash;So he &s;trode back &s;ome paces, pulling his friend, who&s;e turn it now was to linger be|hind.&mdash;"They will be taken care of," &s;aid Henry.&mdash;"You will walk over again &s;oon, you know, or&mdash;or&mdash;or <HI>I</HI> can bring&mdash;bring&mdash;bring them&mdash;my&s;elf&mdash;to the ab&mdash;ab&mdash;ab|bey."</P>
<P>"<HI>I</HI> walk over again to the ca&s;tle!&mdash;<HI>you</HI> bring them to the abbey!&mdash;Alas! my friend, have you &s;o &s;oon forgot our &s;olemn re&s;olu|tions? &mdash;Exert your&s;elf," cried Charles,&mdash;"bravely.&mdash;What a noble pile is Fitzorton Ca&s;tle, my friend!"</P>
<P>"The abbey, methinks, is a more attrac|tive object:&mdash;&s;uch grandeur, &s;o many awful charms&mdash;&s;o many&mdash;only look at it as the &s;un falls on the we&s;tern turrets:&mdash;a long
<PB N="305" REF="315">and eternal adieu, thou &s;acred man&s;ion! farewel, for ever!"</P>
<P>Henry walked towards it with ha&s;ty &s;trides, all the while he was &s;peaking.&mdash;"Yes! Adieu! thou venerable edifice, who&s;e very ruins are dear to my &s;oul!&mdash;and ye, O con&s;cious woods, who have often witne&s;&s;ed my &s;ighs and tears &mdash; my fer|vent vows, and bitter execrations, again&s;t per&s;ecuting fortune.&mdash;But chiefly thou, Oh heart-en&s;hrined bower!"</P>
<P>Henry quickened his &s;teps, till he almo&s;t ran.</P>
<P>"Thou received&s;t my fir&s;t trembling de|clarations of a pa&s;&s;ion that has not hitherto, for one moment," continued he,&mdash;"and <HI>&s;hall</HI> never quit, my troubled brea&s;t!&mdash;and thou, oh well-remembered tree, who&s;e ten|der bark is &s;till, I tru&s;t, faithful to tho&s;e names, which, alas! mu&s;t never, never be united!"&mdash;</P>
<P>The &s;pirits of pa&s;&s;ion and of poe&s;y were now at work; and Henry, de&s;irous that his feet and tongue &s;hould keep pace with each other, had got to the &s;ide of the very tree
<PB N="306" REF="316">of which he had been &s;o pathetically taking an everla&s;ting leave;&mdash;when happening&mdash;then for the fir&s;t time &s;ince his &s;oliloquy began&mdash;to recollect his friend, he turned round, and &s;aw that no le&s;s di&s;tracted lover going, as fa&s;t as his legs could carry him, in the contrary direction, towards the ca&s;tle, to bid as affectionate and as eternal an adieu to its appreciated objects.</P>
<P>Henry exalted his voice, and a&s;&s;ured his friend "he was going the wrong way:"&mdash;which Charles retorted upon Henry,&mdash;and thus they &s;tood for a con&s;iderable time, hallooing and beckoning to each other, each &s;teady to follow that part of the com|pa&s;s to which his own affections pointed.</P>
<P>Alas! the abbey and ca&s;tle were as the oppo&s;ite poles, &mdash; Henry and his friend, the attracted needles.</P>

<P>WHILE they were vibrating to their different points, little Fitz, whom fate &s;eems to have intended as the &s;mall but
<PB N="307" REF="317">important in&s;trument of many a great event in this hi&s;tory, was heard to give tongue, and cha&s;e a hare, which he had &s;tarted, at full cry, till all the woods of Stuart were made vocal with his mu&s;ic.&mdash;The animal took up the great avenue, and &s;eeing the unequal enemy &s;he had to contend with, rather played with her &s;lender legs, than put them on the &s;tretch, keeping only at a &s;afe di&s;tance before the panting little Fitz, as if &s;he intended to afford him diver&s;ion.</P>
<P>Henry, taken by &s;urpri&s;e, though not a great admirer of the cha&s;e, now followed the &s;port, and by turning towards the &s;ame &s;ide of the hedge with the hare, whenever &s;he deviated from the track that led imme|diately to the abbey, &s;eemed to wi&s;h &s;he would keep the &s;traight road; while Charles, who came &s;lowly after, perhaps would have been better plea&s;ed had &s;he taken her cour&s;e towards the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>It was, however, decreed that the ab|bey &s;hould now be the a&s;ylum for the poor hare; and, having reached the gate of en|trance, &s;he &s;prung through a well-known
<PB N="308" REF="318">meu&s;e, formed among &s;ome bu&s;hes that clu&s;tered at the bottom of the avenue; and, notwith&s;tanding the utmo&s;t efforts of little Fitz, was &s;oon lo&s;t in the windings of the fore&s;t.</P>
<P>The hue and cry of the &s;paniel, however, and of Henry, who, though on very differ|ent motives, was not le&s;s vociferous, had not only brought forth into the front garden that faced the grand avenue, &s;everal other four-footed lovers of the &s;port, who &s;welled the thunder of the woods, at they knew not what, but alarmed Sir Gui&s;e, hone&s;t Denni&s;on, and la&s;tly Caroline her&s;elf, who all ran to the iron railing to &s;ee what was the matter.</P>
<P>Henry, who was, very conveniently for his embarra&s;&s;ment, out of breath from his pur&s;uit, explained the circum&s;tance, and was relating the heroic achievements of little Fitz,&mdash;accounting, at the &s;ame time, to Caroline for his delay, when the coura|geous animal came panting into the gar|den, where, hardly finding breath to ex|pre&s;s his tran&s;ports at being re&s;tored to
<PB N="309" REF="319">his mi&s;tre&s;s, he threw him&s;elf on his &s;ide upon one of the gra&s;s plats, and, &s;till the mo&s;t happy of the groupe, recovered his &s;trength and &s;pirits at lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently after, arrived the tardy Charles; and, when Denni&s;on had con&s;ulted the countenances of the whole company, and &s;eeing nothing there either particularly to delight or to di&s;tre&s;s him, he patted little Fitz on the head, telling him, "Pu&s;s had led him a fine dance, and, like many other fine folks, had made a fool of him at la&s;t:" and with this pithy remark the good old man withdrew.</P>
<P>There never perhaps was exhibited in any four faces more characteri&s;tic impa|tience, than in tho&s;e of the party then pre|&s;ent,&mdash;Henry and Charles, to di&s;gui&s;e their &s;ecret emotions,&mdash;Sir Gui&s;e and Caroline to di&s;cover them.</P>
<P>This threw them all into very aukward &s;ituations.&mdash;Caroline, from certain clouds not unattended with &s;howers, that gathered and fell involuntarily on the features of Henry, was afraid to a&s;k any que&s;tions:
<PB N="310" REF="320">and Charles, whi&s;pering her not to be inqui&s;itive, ob&s;erved that "Ill tidings al|ways arrived too &s;oon," augmented her di|&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>At length Sir Gui&s;e, counterfeiting a generous anxiety to know the re&s;ult of his advances to reconcilement, and expa|tiating on the ardent de&s;ire he felt to com|plete the good work he had begun, in&s;i&s;ted upon his &s;on's telling him, "How his over|tures had been received?"</P>
<P>Charles made &s;hift to acquaint him with the truth, &s;o far as his father was concerned;&mdash;he &s;aid that "Sir Armine received them with proper kindne&s;s, and would be as ready to conciliate as Sir Gui&s;e."</P>
<P>Henry, finding that his friend got through this garbled relation but very lamely, of|fered him a helping hand, by taking up the narrative, and carrying it on, &s;o far as had any relation to Olivia's amicable me&s;&s;age to Caroline.&mdash;But Henry was not more &s;uc|ce&s;sful than his friend: for, though he like|wi&s;e indulged pretty copiou&s;ly in mental re&s;ervations, the difficulty which he found
<PB N="311" REF="321">to &s;eparate what was unfit for communica|tion, from what might &s;afely be divulged, rendered the whole &s;tory &s;o di&s;membered and incongruous, that a far le&s;s di&s;cerning &s;pectator, than either the baronet or his daughter, might ea&s;ily conceive there was a great deal more hid than there had been di&s;covered.</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e, therefore, choo&s;ing to inter|pret their confu&s;ion to a di&s;like of relating all that had pa&s;t, thought fit to act the part of the man of violated feelings and nice honour, and to exclaim, "Very well, I &s;ee how it is!&mdash;I have been in&s;ulted.&mdash;My fool|i&s;h good-nature has been rejected.&mdash;I might have expected as much, indeed!&mdash;But you would over-rule me.&mdash;You know your in|fluence, and &s;ee the con&s;equence of it!&mdash;However, thank heaven, I have the con&s;o|lation to &s;uffer this fre&s;h outrage for my children's &s;ake; and &s;o I &s;ubmit.&mdash;But, me|thinks, when I conde&s;cended to make the fir&s;t advances towards the Ca&s;tle, your father, young gentleman, &s;hould not have
<PB N="312" REF="322">driven me back to the Abbey with di&s;grace, or have him&s;elf retreated.</P>
<P>Henry was about to reply, and with &s;ome generous warmth, in defence of his father,&mdash;from a tender love of whom, no &s;ufferings of his own, though proceeding from that father, could detach him;&mdash;when Charles, who was a young man of high honour and exalted principles, felt it an incumbent duty to take the ju&s;tification of Sir Armine upon him&s;elf. "Sir," &s;aid he, "the overtures you offered, were, as I before ob&s;erverd, received with &s;uitable kindne&s;s: and I am convinced your vi&s;it will be returned with a confirma|tion of the mo&s;t ho&s;pitable a&s;&s;urances&mdash;but&mdash;"</P>
<P>"But what?" que&s;tioned Sir Gui&s;e.</P>
<P>Henry, who pre&s;aged &s;ome po&s;&s;ible good from concealing, and much po&s;itive mi&s;chief from divulging, all that might naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed to follow, ob&s;erved, in an abrupt manner, that "nothing had pa&s;&s;ed between his father and friend any way incon&s;i&s;tent with&mdash;that is&mdash;as to that&mdash;he only meant&mdash;he
<PB N="313" REF="323">could a&s;&s;ure Sir Gui&s;e, as to what had pa&s;t,&mdash;nothing material relative thereto, he could take on him&s;elf to &s;ay,&mdash;in regard to the circum&s;tances which&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Mr. Fitzorton," interpo&s;ed the baronet, "your attempts to explain away the repul&s;e I have met with from your family, are as generous as they are un&s;atisfactory; there is at the bottom of all this a &s;omething&mdash;"</P>
<P>Caroline interrupted the father di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this matter, by declaring &s;he was &s;uddenly &s;eized with &s;o dreadful a giddine&s;s, that if &s;he did not hurry into the hou&s;e &s;he &s;hould certainly tumble. Indeed, her whole ap|pearance but too clearly confirmed the de|&s;cription of her &s;ituation: &s;he was with difficulty conducted to the abbey, under the &s;upports of Henry and Charles,&mdash;the former pre&s;&s;ing her to his heart and whi&s;pering a thou&s;and tenderne&s;&s;es in her ear as they pa&s;&s;ed along, to the total oblivion of every thing on earth but Caroline's anxiety; and her brother &s;carce le&s;s affectionately tried to recover his &s;i&s;ter's &s;pirits; for he now plainly &s;aw that her di&s;order originated in the ap|prehen&s;ions
<PB N="314" REF="324">of her mind, as to what had pa&s;t at the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e Stuart, not being quite &s;o much intere&s;ted in or affected by the&s;e kind of di&s;a&s;ters, took a turn or two round the gar|den, where we &s;hall leave him to the only per&s;on he did really intere&s;t him&s;elf for&mdash;to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>His afflicted daughter now, in a voice of woe and terror, called upon Henry and her brother to unfold the dreadful my&s;tery which lay hid behind, or was partly &s;een &s;truggling in, their expre&s;&s;ions. "What new grief has befallen us?" &s;aid &s;he: "it cannot &s;ur|pa&s;s what my de&s;pair &s;ugge&s;ts; and I conjure you, both by friend&s;hip, love, duty, and all that is dear to us, reveal the whole! I know not wherefore I am thus affected; but I feel as if &s;omething more terrible than any thing I have yet endured was about to involve us all!"</P>
<P>"No!" &s;aid Henry, dropping &s;uddenly on his knee, "No, Caroline! neither father, nor fate it&s;elf,&mdash;I here &s;olemnly &s;wear&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Whatever be the nature of your oath, it
<PB N="315" REF="325">mu&s;t not be made," replied Caroline: "nor could I hear it now;&mdash;for &s;o great, alas! is my pre&s;ent weakne&s;s, that&mdash;O my father, why, when I had yielded my&s;elf up to the cold mandates of de&s;pair,&mdash;why did you re|vive my hopes?&mdash;or how, knowing, as I did, the many in&s;urmountable evils which en|viron all of us,&mdash;ah! how could I be &s;o frantic&mdash;&s;o&mdash;"</P>
<P>While &s;he was proceeding in this apo|&s;trophe, the venerable Denni&s;on made his appearance, bearing two letters, one of which he delivered to Caroline, the other he laid upon the table, &s;aying, "it was for Sir Gui&s;e."</P>
<P>The baronet him&s;elf came in immediate|ly after: and Charles de&s;iring Denni&s;on to leave the room, the re&s;t of the party, before a&s;&s;embled in the garden, were now grouped in the great hall, where Caroline, it being the fir&s;t apartment, had re&s;ted.</P>
<P>Although her &s;trength appeared, in the moment before, to have left her, &s;he rallied &s;ufficiently, to break the &s;eal of the above|mentioned letter, and was ju&s;t about to read
<PB N="316" REF="326">the contents, when Sir Gui&s;e, having with no le&s;s curio&s;ity opened that which had been di|rected to him&s;elf, read aloud what follows,&mdash;premi&s;ing, "that it came from the ca&s;tle, and appeared to be written by Sir Armine Fitzorton."</P>
<P>Human attention, or expectation, never perhaps having been more fixed, than du|ring the peru&s;al of this epi&s;tle, we will a&s;&s;ign it a di&s;tinct place.</P>

<P>"SIR ARMINE FITZORTON and family receive Sir Gui&s;e Stuart's advances to reconci|liation, with all the attention due to them: and although &s;ome dome&s;tic concerns pre|vented an immediate reply in writing, pro|per acknowledgments were di&s;patched by our friend Charles, who&s;e many virtues we all hold in high regard: and Sir Armine, for him&s;elf and his family, in which he includes by authority that of the Clares, now a&s;&s;ures
<PB N="317" REF="327">Sir Gui&s;e, his welcome to the ca&s;tle &s;hall be no le&s;s cordial than they expect to find at the abbey; and that the fir&s;t vi&s;it &s;hall be left to his own nomination, as &s;oon as he plea&s;es, after an event, arrang|ing between the families of Fitzorton and Clare, has taken place; which it is now ex|pected to do in the cour&s;e of a few days."</P>
<P>The con&s;ternation of Henry and Charles, while the baronet read this card, could be &s;urpa&s;&s;ed only by that which, like a hurri|cane, &s;hook the frame of Caroline. On hearing the la&s;t pa&s;&s;age, &s;he dropt the paper, which had long trembled in her hand, upon the floor, and &s;inking her&s;elf after it, cried out in a fee|ble yet agonized and interrupted voice, "In&mdash;a&mdash;few&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;very&mdash;few days!"</P>
<P>Henry's eye caught the &s;uper&s;cription of the card which was addre&s;&s;ed to Caroline, and perceived the hand writing of Olivia. He would, hereupon, have glided it into his pocket, to prevent at lea&s;t farther mi&s;chief. But Sir Gui&s;e, with a &s;olicitude truly cha|racteri&s;tic of <HI>his</HI> paternal feelings&mdash;wounded, no doubt, at &s;eeing his now beloved daugh|ter

<P>Henry &s;tood by Caroline's &s;ide, hovering between &s;en&s;e and in&s;anity:&mdash;Charles was in a kind of &s;tupor, perhaps, at that time, friendly to his rea&s;on; and Caroline &s;eemed to &s;hudder betwixt life and death.</P>
<P>TO MISS STUART.</P>
<P>"THE cu&s;toms of the world require that I &s;hould begin and end my introductory letter with certain pre&s;criptive formalities; but, in the fir&s;t place, can I con&s;ider Caro|line Stuart as a &s;tranger, when, even in our almo&s;t infant days, I bore to her a &s;i&s;ter's love, and have &s;ince been intimately ac|quainted with her virtues, and as long have loved and honoured her for them? And indeed I am &s;o little an ob&s;erver of etiquette, where my affections are concerned, that I &s;hould put the greate&s;t re&s;traint imaginable on tho&s;e affections, were I to clog them with

<P>"Dear Sir Gui&s;e," &s;aid Henry, "it is cruel to proceed, when you &s;ee how your daughter, and indeed all of us are afflicted."</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="330">"Afflicted!" reiterated the baronet: "&s;urely there has nothing of an afflictive kind yet occurred; and I therefore augur well of the re&s;t."</P>
<P>"I entreat," &s;aid Caroline,&mdash;"that my father may be permitted to pro|ceed."</P>
<P>Charles was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e read on, "I catch up the pen to inform my long-loved Caroline of my happine&s;s, not only becau&s;e I could not '&s;uffer the coldne&s;s of delay to hang on' &s;uch heartfelt tidings, but becau&s;e I cheri&s;h the hope that my felicity will be &s;hared by Mi&s;s Stuart."</P>
<P>"Felicity!" exclaimed Caroline.</P>
<P>Henry, who had taken advantage of this pau&s;e, having ca&s;t his eye over the re&s;idue of Olivia's epi&s;tle, which the baronet held carele&s;sly down that he might the better ob|&s;erve on the parties, took hold of the paper, and cried, "excu&s;e me, &s;ir!&mdash;we have heard too much already:&mdash;what remains, I &s;ee, is of no con&s;equence.

<P><PB N="321" REF="331">"If you plea&s;e, Mr. Fitzorton," an&s;wered Sir Gui&s;e, pretending offence, "we will go through the re&s;t, and form our own judg|ment of its con&s;equence."</P>
<P>Charles and his &s;i&s;ter &s;eemed to anticipate the &s;entiments that were to follow, in Hen|ry's countenance; which was at all times an expre&s;&s;ive one, and might now be &s;aid in Shake&s;peare's language, "to be a book, in which one might read &s;trange matters." From their peru&s;al of this, they prepared them&s;elves for &s;omething mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>The baronet a&s;&s;erted that, hitherto, he &s;aw nothing but what was in good train, and proceeded thus: "I mu&s;t inform my dear Caroline&mdash;that&mdash;that&mdash;I prote&s;t I hardly know how to write it&mdash;that&mdash;after a life of wooing&mdash;a certain event is likely to take place be|tween one of <HI>my</HI> family&mdash;and&mdash;and one of&mdash;but, I under&s;tand, Henry accompanied his friend home; and as I &s;uppo&s;e him to be &s;till at the abbey, I refer you to <HI>him</HI> for the particulars;&mdash;or if <HI>he</HI> refu&s;es, your brother may be applied to."</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="332">If the reader's own mind furni&s;hes not a &s;ketch of the &s;ituation of the trio mo&s;t con|cerned in this intelligence, and e&s;pecially the reference to Henry and Charles, we mu&s;t fairly confe&s;s the inability of our pen to de&s;cribe it.</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e, having in&s;idiou&s;ly made unob|&s;erved ob&s;ervations, read on&mdash;</P>
<P>"I only mention the circum&s;tance, as a tender thought, at the moment of my writ|ing, &s;teals into my heart, purporting the honour and happine&s;s I &s;hould derive, had I the privileges of a friend to invite the gentle Caroline's &s;ervice on an occa&s;ion which&mdash;in &s;hort, as I &s;aid before, not being able to con&s;ider her in any other light than an old&mdash;an intimate&mdash;a bo&s;om friend&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;"</P>
<P>Sir Gui&s;e, ma&s;king a cruel purpo&s;e in kind expre&s;&s;ions, declared that "he feared, what followed was coming rather too clo&s;ely to the point.&mdash;However," added the baronet, "it is but another &s;entence; the &s;ooner an unplea&s;ant thing was over, the better.&mdash;Su&s;pen&s;e was the &s;ore&s;t of evils; and he
<PB N="323" REF="333">would therefore get rid of the remainder as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible." He then appeared to hurry over what follows:</P>
<P>"I feel a degree of anxiety, for which I cannot account, that the, I hope and tru&s;t in heaven, mo&s;t joyful day of my life, even though I thus tremble at its approach, &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;hed by two of the great|e&s;t ble&s;&s;ings&mdash;the acqui&s;ition of a&mdash;how &s;hall I name it&mdash;of a tender hu&s;band!&mdash;I can &s;carcely write&mdash;and the recovery of my ear|lie&s;t friend:&mdash;and this double felicity I am ambitious to mark by the latter undertak|ing the gentle&s;t, the mo&s;t endearing office of friend&s;hip. Ah! cannot my Caroline con|jecture what the tumult of my &s;oul permits me not to&mdash;"</P>
<P>"She wi&s;hes you to be one of her bride|maids, I &s;uppo&s;e," &s;aid Sir Gui&s;e, affecting a bluntne&s;s, for which, almo&s;t in the com|mi&s;&s;ion of it, he pretended to reproach him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Her bridemaid!" ejaculated the trio at the &s;ame time:&mdash;"her bridemaid!"</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="334">"That, indeed, is too much!" &s;aid Sir Gui&s;e, affecting to &s;ympathi&s;e.</P>
<P>"Damnation!" exclaimed Charles, ri&s;ing and &s;tamping as he walked toward the door,&mdash;then turned, and taking Henry by the hand,&mdash;"yet, God ble&s;s you together! It mu&s;t be &s;o. It ought&mdash;and I &s;ubmit&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;do.&mdash;My friend, farewel."</P>
<P>Caroline attempted to follow her bro|ther's example; but, catching his arm as he was going, &s;he could only &s;ay&mdash;"I&mdash;too&mdash;re&s;ign my&s;elf&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;from my &s;oul&mdash;repeat the benediction!" She withdrew, &s;upported by Charles.</P>
<P>"My dear Henry," &s;aid Sir Gui&s;e, almo&s;t betraying his triumph in the attempt to re|fine upon it, "you perceive I have done my utmo&s;t&mdash;I have &s;ought, petitioned, and al|mo&s;t pro&s;trated, my&s;elf,&mdash;but all in vain: my children and my&s;elf remain unhappy, and yet, in this in&s;tance, none of us perhaps can blame any of your family."</P>
<P>The baronet pau&s;ed, &s;eeing Henry &s;tart from his &s;eat, &s;eize his hair in de&s;peration,
<PB N="325" REF="335">and then &s;triking his brea&s;t as he ejaculated, "No! my worthy friend, it is not you nor any body el&s;e:&mdash;it is the work of my own cur&s;ed, cur&s;ed fortune!"</P>
<P>A &s;ervant entered, &s;aying to Sir Gui&s;e, "the gentleman you expected, &s;ir, is come."&mdash;"I will attend him immediately," ob|&s;erved the baronet: then adverting to Hen|ry,&mdash;"I am really concerned to &s;ee you &s;o much affected, Mr. Fitzorton. I have only to regret that my paternal efforts have not an&s;wered the end propo&s;ed: and as &s;ome very particular bu&s;ine&s;s claims me el&s;ewhere, I mu&s;t bid you farewel: but we &s;hall meet: yes, we &s;hall certainly meet.&mdash;The abbey is &s;till open, you know; and though my good offices have failed, my be&s;t wi&s;hes are yours."</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXXVII.</HEAD>
<P>HENRY was now again left to his &s;o|liloquies in that hou&s;e where it &s;eemed fated for him to meet varieties of di&s;tre&s;s, di&s;appointment, and de&s;pair.&mdash;He found
<PB N="326" REF="336">him&s;elf more &s;orely be&s;et than ever:&mdash;his grand di&s;covery had been made to &s;ome of the parties who were principally concerned in it;&mdash;and he had the mortification to per|ceive, his &s;ecret might have been better &s;till confined to his own bo&s;om.&mdash;At the ca&s;tle, his father, mother, and brother James, were made partakers of it: letters had been &s;ent on the &s;ubject to John:&mdash;at the abbey it had been communicated to Sir Gui&s;e and Caro|line, with equal ill fortune.&mdash;Olivia and her father only had e&s;caped: and were the knowledge of his involvement even to ex|tend to them, it was plain to be &s;een, that, although the &s;ecret would then have taken its full range, like the flight of an empoi|&s;oned arrow, it would have lo&s;t nothing by its pa&s;&s;age though the air, but &s;catter de&s;o|lation in its progre&s;s.</P>
<P>Under this conviction, Henry once again left the abbey, &s;taring wildly at Denni&s;on, who once more opened the door to him in an extreme of his mi&s;ery,&mdash;and in a &s;tate betwixt &s;en&s;e and di&s;traction.</P>
<P>As the reader has &s;everal times accompa|nied
<PB N="327" REF="337">the ill-&s;tarred Henry in his gloomy walks to and from the&s;e man&s;ions, we will not now pre&s;s his attendance: but while Henry is on his way, we &s;hall enter that apartment in the abbey, where the per&s;on who, it has been noticed, came to wait upon Sir Gui&s;e Stuart, was conducted, and whither Sir Gui&s;e was now gone to give him audi|ence.</P>
<P>But, previou&s;ly to our joining them, it may be right to take a &s;hort retro&s;pective view of the points which the worthy baronet had gained, &s;ince his antipathy to the hou&s;e of Fitzorton, and his no le&s;s radical aver|&s;ion to his daughter, had arrived at their height, and &s;ince, for certain purpo&s;es yet in the womb of time, he had a&s;&s;umed the ma&s;k of affection and good-will.</P>
<P>From the date of this memorable aera when his hate admitted not of augmenta|tion, the &s;aid ma&s;k of kindne&s;s had conti|nued to thicken, till not only the innocent victims thereof, Charles, Caroline, Denni|&s;on, Henry, and the re&s;t, were deceived by it,&mdash;but even the principal agent in his own
<PB N="328" REF="338">de&s;igns was enabled to penetrate the dark|ne&s;s of its folds.</P>
<P>By this re&s;olute and patient hypocri&s;y, he had, without any per&s;onal hazard, the only point which his fell nature felt as a check, effected, in a degree, what was ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to his &s;afety in the perpe|tration of &s;ome nobler works of wickedne&s;s. He had, by his pretended reform, taken off the bitter edge of that dete&s;tation in which he was held by every creature of his own hou&s;hold.&mdash;He had contrived to &s;hift from his own &s;houlders the weight of whatever con&s;equences might re&s;ult from tho&s;e haple&s;s loves, which his cold heart had a&s;&s;ured him would, at lea&s;t he was determined to take care they &s;hould, be more &s;ickly under his chilling influence, than if he any longer ap|peared to oppo&s;e them: and his &s;eeming to &s;hine upon them was but like the tran&s;ient gleam of the dog-&s;tar, that darts upon flow|ers after an untimely blight had lodged the worm within their bud.&mdash;He knew, indeed, that even if Henry and his daughter &s;hould come together, as one con&s;equence of his
<PB N="329" REF="339">affected reconciliation, the union it&s;elf might be made &s;ub&s;ervient to his purpo&s;e of final revenge, not only in working the woe of both the hu&s;band and wife, but of every individual of the two dete&s;ted hou&s;es of Clare and Fitzorton, and principally by the di&s;appointment of their views in the di&s;po|&s;al of Olivia, the whole &s;cope of which he had been made acquainted with before the partial di&s;coveries of Caroline or Henry, although we have not yet thought proper to communicate his &s;ources of intelligence to the reader.</P>
<P>But, in fact, he did not &s;eriou&s;ly believe his advance to good fellow&s;hip would pro|duce a match between his daughter and Henry, and only provided for it in his own prolific mind; as a po&s;&s;ible contingence. He rather anticipated what really happened, that either the folly of the lovers them|&s;elves, or his own contrivance, would but the more de&s;troy their hopes, the more they were made known;&mdash;and <HI>that,</HI> independent on the &s;atisfaction which their vexation would give him, for the &s;incere hate he bore
<PB N="330" REF="340">them, he &s;hould derive from the appear|ance of having annihilated all his own re|&s;entments, the more &s;olid happine&s;s he ex|pected from entrapping the credulity of the Fitzortons.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not omit the mention of ano|ther, and that not the lea&s;t important point acquired by his thus "&s;eeming the thing he was not," viz. the mea&s;ure of odium he here|by took from him&s;elf in the opinion of his neighbours, who heard of his great change of conduct, not only from the &s;ervants, who had before reprobated his behaviour, but from the parties who were the objects of this extraordinary alteration.</P>
<P>The people of the pari&s;h, indeed, inter|preted this extraordinary change into a miracle: but the good monk, who was now one of the mo&s;t zealous of his advocates, a&s;&s;ured them it was the &s;imple operation of con&s;cience, which it had plea&s;ed God to awake in his heart, in time not only to make atonement to all whom he had injured in this pre&s;ent world, but effect his future &s;al|vation in the world to come.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="341">To &s;ay the truth, the baronet had been at more than u&s;ual pains to ob&s;erve a con&s;i&s;tent conduct in the pre&s;ence of our mona&s;tic, who, though a man of great &s;implicity, and devoid of the &s;u&s;picion, which tho&s;e who are them&s;elves guilty cultivate mo&s;t, was likewi&s;e of a very penetrating mind.&mdash;Yet, the uniform di&s;eretion of Sir Gui&s;e was more than a match for the doctor's clearne&s;s of head or purity of heart,&mdash;in&s;omuch that the be&s;t, warme&s;t, and mo&s;t able, as well as mo&s;t active defender of the baronet, far and near, at home and abroad, was now Father Arthur.</P>
<P>It is hence apparent, that Sir Gui&s;e, in a very &s;hort &s;pace of time, but with a dili|gence &s;uitable to &s;o great an object, might be &s;aid to have done what is ju&s;tly to be con&s;idered among&s;t the mo&s;t arduous of all human labours,&mdash;to have redeemed a lo&s;t character, even when, indeed, it was &s;up|po&s;ed to be gone, <HI>pa&s;t</HI> redemption&mdash;It was &s;till remembered by many how bad he had been; but it was generally be|lieved he had, though late, &s;een his errors,
<PB N="332" REF="342">and that if he was now &s;ometimes as outra|geous in doing worthy, as before he had been violent in committing wicked actions, it &s;hould be imputed to him as an over-anxi|ous de&s;ire to make up lo&s;t time, and to fini&s;h his own career of virtue by labouring doubly in the vineyard, that he might work out the &s;alvation which had been &s;o long neglected. Upon the whole, therefore, few per&s;ons en|joyed a fairer regenerated fame, &s;ince the death of his lady, as a good father, a good neighbour, or a &s;incere penitent, than Sir Gui&s;e Stuart.</P>
<P>Perhaps, Sir Armine and John Fitzorton, and one or two more, might &s;till have their &s;u&s;picions;&mdash;yet there was only one man living, who, at the moment here alluded to, could bear witne&s;s that he was much <HI>more</HI> con&s;ummate in the ways of deceit than he had ever been before;&mdash;and this &s;ingle living per&s;on was HIMSELF.</P>
<P>It was even doubted by the per&s;on who now came to di&s;cour&s;e with him, and to whom we &s;hall immediately introduce the reader.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="343">This per&s;on was no other than the noto|rious Mr. Valentine Miles, the active agent of Sir Gui&s;e upon all occa&s;ions:&mdash;he col|lected his rents and improved his e&s;tates, he got in his monies, and laid them out to what he thought the be&s;t, that is to &s;ay, his own advantage.&mdash;He was no le&s;s the para|&s;ite than the tyrant of Sir Gui&s;e.&mdash;To him the baronet was fir&s;t indebted for the ho|nour of Mrs. Tempe&s;t's acquaintance; and like other providers of his ca&s;t of character, he was &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pected to have fir&s;t ta&s;ted the dainty him&s;elf: yet at other times, jack-all as he was, he knew the art to make the lion crouch at his feet, and tremble before him.&mdash;The above-mentioned lady numbered this gentleman among&s;t her fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, although we hardly know how to call him or any other per&s;on her fir&s;t love, becau&s;e there were, about the &s;ame period, &s;o many candidates for her favour, and from a pecu|liar philanthropy &s;he was &s;o little di&s;po&s;ed to that &s;pecies of cruelty whereby lovers are &s;aid &s;o often to &s;uffer wounds and death, that it would be narrowing her kind and
<PB N="334" REF="344">relenting nature, to confine her loving kind|ne&s;s to any individual.&mdash;Mr. Miles was cer|tainly one of her happy men:&mdash;and Mr. Tempe&s;t, whom &s;he honoured with her hand, was another; but &s;omehow, the latter &s;oon died, and the former had at lea&s;t one rival le&s;s.&mdash;Indeed, Miles continued among&s;t her fir&s;t favourites after the lady's heart got more into practice, and even when her love of mankind, increa&s;ing with the knowledge of &s;uffering objects, and her pity for their &s;uf|ferings, was unbounded.&mdash;But then her Va|lentine recommended him&s;elf by more than one congenial pa&s;&s;ion,&mdash;that of gaming.&mdash;The love of the dice was paramount over all. Indeed it nearly extingui&s;hed every other, or rather it was, in proce&s;s of time, &s;o much the ma&s;ter pa&s;&s;ion, that every other was in va&s;&s;al|age to it:&mdash;love it&s;elf, great, enlarged, and im|partial as it was in the ample heart of this ge|nerous pair, became &s;ub&s;ervient to it:&mdash;for the lady imagined her mighty flame might be fed by once more lighting at it the torch of Hy|men. A dice-box, in &s;uch a hand, &s;eemed to have all the magic power of that torch; and
<PB N="335" REF="345">as Sir Gui&s;e Stuart rai&s;ed his admiring eye to the enchantre&s;s, the dice them&s;elves were as two balls of electric fire; and a thou&s;and &s;parks and gentle &s;hocks were drawn from his heart. In love affairs, Miles was nothing &s;elfi&s;h.&mdash;He &s;ecretly &s;aw this conque&s;t, and interrupted it not:&mdash;on the contrary, he had long called the object of it his bo&s;om friend; and Sir Gui&s;e became another happy man, and entered into the gaming a&s;&s;ociation with a &s;pirit like that of his friend and mi&s;tre&s;s: and, although the afore&s;aid hymeneal torch had not yet lighted our baron a &s;econd time to the altar, it was only con&s;igned to Cupid as a little deity in waiting for a more con|venient &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Meantime, the loves and games of Valen|tine and Mrs. Tempe&s;t went gaily on:&mdash;what though &s;he had no nuptial torch for him? &s;he had a Cupid &s;till very much at his &s;er|vice; and that did full as well.&mdash;And as to the gambling affection, they might both be &s;aid to be "plea&s;ed with ruin;" for they had very often been ruined together on the &s;ame evening, yet retired in the mo&s;t bene|volent
<PB N="336" REF="346">humour, on the &s;ocial principle of making each other happy;&mdash;they had, in|deed, often been made whole again the next morning, by their <HI>cho&s;en</HI> friend, Sir Gui&s;e Stuart, who was altogether un&s;kilful, but whom the lady by the pretences of vio|lent love, and the gentleman by tho&s;e of as vehement friend&s;hip, contrived to pil|lage of what ought to have been appro|priated to his own family:&mdash;for, whatever prai&s;e is due to profu&s;ion, when he had money in his pur&s;e, Sir Gui&s;e might claim wherever his plea&s;ures or fears were con|cerned.&mdash;His temper was &s;ufficiently niggard indeed: but he was coaxed or terrified out of enormous &s;ums, becau&s;e, in truth, except by the &s;tarts of a moment, which he always paid for, he dared not refu&s;e;&mdash;his own mi&s;erable &s;oul was a re&s;ervoir; but Miles and Mrs. Tempe&s;t were the impure &s;treams that exhau&s;ted, and literally, <HI>played</HI> it off.</P>
<P>Yet &s;o radical was this vice of gaming in the widow and Miles, that &s;ometimes, after a run of good fortune had &s;ent them home,&mdash;for they were generally under the &s;ame roof,
<PB N="337" REF="347">&mdash;laden with &s;poils, they would pa&s;s an hour before they went to bed in playing again&s;t each other, and that with the &s;ame de&s;ire to cheat and win, as if they were at work upon &s;ome marked novice, upon whom they had a de&s;ign:&mdash;and whichever, in this t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te game, came off lo&s;er, was to undertake the <HI>odd trick,</HI>&mdash;in other words, it was the lo&s;er's part to wheedle the baro|net out of the next &s;upply.</P>
<P>A &s;light &s;pecimen of the abilities of Mr. Miles was exhibited to the reader in the cheat he attempted to pa&s;s upon the family of the Atwoods, after he had favoured the plan for Jenny's journey to London.&mdash;But &s;ince the di&s;covery of his treachery, he had lived wholly with the baronet's mi&s;tre&s;s as an <HI>ami de mai&s;on,</HI> and had been the confi|dential medium betwixt that lady and Sir Gui&s;e, in certain important points that are now to be communicated.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t material of the&s;e, on the part of the lady, was to make good her ground at the abbey, with a view, as has been inti|mated, to her becoming no le&s;s than lady
<PB N="338" REF="348">of the manor. And the death of lady Ma|tilda gave an unexpected opening to her bold a&s;piring.</P>
<P>To accompli&s;h this, however, was an un|dertaking that called for very extraordinary powers: and although tho&s;e of which Mrs. Tempe&s;t was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, were certainly of this extraordinary kind, they were yet in|&s;ufficient to bring about &s;o great an event, without &s;ome congenial a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>For this, &s;he applied to a man who&s;e ta|lents &s;he had employed in various in&s;tances, with unvarying &s;ucce&s;s.&mdash;Indeed, there was not any one among&s;t her acquaintance,&mdash;un|le&s;s &s;he could have brought Sir Gui&s;e into a plot again&s;t him&s;elf, which indeed &s;he did in many in&s;tances,&mdash;&s;o able, or for the re|wards &s;o willing, as her Valentine, to ad|vance a project which he had &s;ome time &s;u&s;|pected was going on in the mind of his beloved.</P>
<P>Miles was ble&s;t with a head and heart &s;o &s;trictly in alliance with each other, that, like copartners, they carried on bu&s;ine&s;s in the utmo&s;t harmony.&mdash;They had, indeed,
<PB N="339" REF="349">embarked in the &s;ame trade, that of devi&s;|ing and carrying into effect all &s;orts of com|modities which promoted the <HI>meum,</HI> without con&s;idering the <HI>tuum</HI> of this life, &s;o early that they were now become, from long ha|bit and con&s;tant practice, equal to any human undertaking that ever hath, or may be done in roguery.&mdash;And, to complete the allu&s;ion, it might be &s;aid, that the be&s;t e&s;ta|bli&s;hed warehou&s;e of all kinds of knavery, ready made for every po&s;&s;ible purpo&s;e, was under the firm of Mr. Valentine Miles.</P>
<P>This gentleman was of a good figure and genteel addre&s;s, and had indeed, in his youth, been a di&s;tingui&s;hed favourite of the ladies.&mdash;He was now only in the maturity of life, &s;omewhat inclined to a corpulence not &s;trictly con&s;i&s;tent with elegance, but in perfect uni&s;on with our ideas of confirmed manhood.&mdash;He was of an a&s;&s;ured air, con|fident expre&s;&s;ion, ready utterance, ver&s;atile talents, and accommodating manners;&mdash;and from an uncommonly well-knit con&s;truc|tion of limbs, and great natural &s;trength of body, with a certain con&s;titutional power
<PB N="340" REF="350">of drinking others out of their wits while he retained his own, he had run his career in almo&s;t every &s;pecies of debauchery, without being checked by one di&s;tem|per, or puni&s;hed by any pains of body; and as to tho&s;e of mind, he &s;et them glori|ou&s;ly at defiance.&mdash;He had, in &s;hort, arrived at that pre-eminence, at that perfect imper|fection, which annihilates the &s;en&s;e of fear or of &s;hame, and herein was confe&s;&s;edly the &s;uperior, even of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart, who had an abundance of the former, though he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed not a jot of the latter.</P>
<P>Upon all the&s;e grounds, he was the fitte&s;t for a connection with the baronet, of any man in the world: for, as there was not an infamous thought which the heart of man could conceive, but was engendered by Sir Gui&s;e, &s;o was there not any man who had &s;o much intrepidity of practical ba&s;ene&s;s to carry &s;uch conception into action, as Miles.</P>
<P>This accompli&s;hed gentleman, therefore, and Mrs. Tempe&s;t, divided the baronet be|tween them, and had been for &s;ome time contriving how to di&s;po&s;e in a more legal
<PB N="341" REF="351">manner of his family and fortune to their wi&s;hes: for as the widow had, after &s;ound|ing him, avowed her de&s;ign to Miles, of becoming lady Stuart,&mdash;&s;o had Miles, in return of confidence, then fir&s;t mentioned a long-cheri&s;hed intention of making pro|po&s;als to the baronet, for getting rid of the incumbrance of his daughter Caroline.</P>
<P>Now his was a kind of underplot, to be woven into their dome&s;tic plan, in order to &s;trengthen their intere&s;ts.&mdash;This little epi|&s;ode, indeed, rather endeared the expected cata&s;trophe to Mr. Miles, who, at the fall of the curtain, promi&s;ed him&s;elf from this double marriage, which might indeed be called the title of the farce, <HI>more</HI> than dou|ble advantage;&mdash;while Mrs. Tempe&s;t was reconciled to it, on principles of equal con|venience and accommodation, differing only a little in the idea as to Caroline.&mdash;She did not love Miles well enough, to feel any jealou&s;y about the divi&s;ion of his per&s;onal favours: but &s;he indulged the &s;ecret thought, that &s;he &s;hould come in not only for an equal divi&s;ion of Caroline's fortune,&mdash;Miles
<PB N="342" REF="352">having promi&s;ed her a moiety in ca&s;e the match &s;hould be brought about,&mdash;but for the &s;ole and &s;overeign authority over the e&s;tates of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart; meditating, indeed, to hold the&s;e &s;o much at controul, that neither her Sir Gui&s;e nor her Valentine &s;hould have a greater proportion than their good beha|viour to her &s;eemed to merit from her bounty.&mdash;As to the baronet's per&s;on, her di&s;covery of his infidelity with Jane At|wood was the fini&s;hing &s;troke to the remains of what &s;he was plea&s;ed to call love:&mdash;&s;he held it more cheap than that of Miles; but not being over nice in her &s;en&s;ations, &s;he fore&s;aw the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;till retaining both in the voluminous li&s;t of her happy men.</P>
<P>In regard to the nature of Valentine's attachment to Caroline, it as little partook of the trouble&s;ome and avaricious tender|ne&s;s which confines the great pa&s;&s;ion of love to one per&s;on, as that which Mrs. Tempe&s;t bore either to her intended hu&s;|band, or to her old protector: for though Mrs. Tempe&s;t was a woman of &s;ome violence, in all re&s;pects, &s;he profe&s;&s;ed &s;overeign &s;corn of
<PB N="343" REF="353">tho&s;e who affected to argue again&s;t plu|ralities in the <HI>belle pa&s;&s;ion:</HI> and though &s;he declared &s;he doated on Miles to di&s;traction, it was thought various others were her doating pieces al&s;o: and a dome&s;tic of her father's had di&s;tracted her in the &s;ame manner &s;o effectually &s;ome months be|fore, that the outward and vi&s;ible &s;igns of it were obvious even when her elope|ment from her family was determined on, and the arms of the accommodating Va|lentine were open to receive her with all incumbrances. It was a long-balanced point on her part, whether &s;he &s;hould &s;tay with Mr. Thomas the footman, or run away with Mr. Valentine Miles, her papa's engro&s;&s;ing clerk; for at that time her father was an attorney, and Miles was his a&s;&s;i&s;tant. A compromi&s;e, however, took place between all parties. Mr. Thomas had a parting <HI>dou|ceur,</HI> and a promi&s;e of future provi&s;ion; and Mr. Miles agreed to the arrangement, in all its parts, and &s;o carried off the lady; but, whether they did, or did not, provide for
<PB N="344" REF="354">Mr. Thomas, cannot at this moment be made known.</P>
<P>Miles had often &s;een Mi&s;s Stuart both in her mother's life-time, and &s;ince her death, but had never intimated his pa&s;&s;ion, other|wi&s;e than by certain &s;ighs and &s;miles, moral &s;entences, and well-turned compliments, from time to time, which, partly his &s;ubor|dinate &s;ituation in life as her father's agent, and partly her own pre-occupied &s;entiments, had prevented Caroline from &s;eeing, in the lea&s;t degree, the drift of. He intended, indeed, at fir&s;t only to &s;educe her: but he now en|tertained honourable &s;entiments, as the mo&s;t profitable. In regard to the former objec|tion to him, Miles con&s;idered it, on reflection, now done away by his profe&s;&s;ion, as he al|ways maintained, before tho&s;e who were di&s;po&s;ed to que&s;tion his titles, that a gam|bler was <HI>a gentleman,</HI> &s;eeing it mixed him con&s;tantly in the very be&s;t company: and if ever the baronet di&s;puted the claim, Miles would ri&s;e up in great di&s;plea&s;ure, u&s;e &s;ome terrifying menace, and in&s;i&s;t either on re|ceiving
<PB N="345" REF="355">a &s;uitable apology, or the &s;atisfac|tion due to a <HI>gentleman.</HI></P>
<P>Of late, indeed, &s;ome pretty &s;mart con|te&s;ts, about divi&s;ion of &s;poil, had pa&s;t be|tween Miles and the widow: their affection for each other was almo&s;t worn out; and yet their ties of intere&s;t were &s;o &s;trong, that fear operated now, as love had done before, to keep them together; for each well knew, a very little treachery on either &s;ide&mdash;as is the ca&s;e with mo&s;t rogues who confederate,&mdash;would de&s;troy both.</P>
<P>Believing that the reader is by this time as perfectly acquainted with the&s;e great per|&s;onages, as it is nece&s;&s;ary for him to be, to the right under&s;tanding the events which chain our hi&s;tory,&mdash;we &s;hall proceed to un|fold the bu&s;ine&s;s which brought Mr. Miles to the abbey. But as what pa&s;t between the worthy agent and his illu&s;trious em|ployer, will be, in part, be&s;t given in dia|logue, we &s;hall, as being indeed fit company only for each other, give them a chapter to them&s;elves.</P>

</SP>
<P>Having wrought the baronet to this, the proper pitch of curio&s;ity, expectation, and terror, Mr. Miles pau&s;ed,&mdash;when, &s;eeing Sir Gui&s;e in a di&s;po&s;ition to believe every thing, and to dread what he believed, he exclaimed, "But there is &s;ome &s;atisfaction in the thought, that, unle&s;s we all become victims at the &s;ame time, you &s;hall not, my dear friend,&mdash;no, you &s;hall not die unre|venged."</P>

<P>"Fly from me and Tempe&s;t! you cannot! &s;hall not!" cries Miles: "for <HI>her</HI> love, and <HI>my</HI>
<PB N="353" REF="363">friend&s;hip, &s;hall follow you to the uttermo&s;t ends of the earth.&mdash;Ah! my good friend, were we all united by ties as &s;acred as they are &s;trong, were we all of one family, and our fates and fortunes run together, what could hurt us?

<P>"I &s;ee your wi&s;hes," an&s;wered the baro|net:&mdash;"your long-de&s;ired happine&s;s &s;hall be granted.&mdash;I here pledge my&s;elf that <HI>my</HI> hand &s;hall be Tempe&s;t's, and my <HI>daughter's</HI> yours,&mdash;if you will, in this in&s;tance, re&s;cue me from the de&s;igns of the accur&s;ed Fitz|ortons, and effect my revenge upon them without hazard to my per&s;on.</P>
<P>"It is enough," &s;aid Miles. "I know you are a man of honour; and the in&s;tant I have informed Mrs. Tempe&s;t of her happine&s;s,&mdash;you know how it will rejoice her tender &s;oul, which doats on you,&mdash;tho&s;e mea&s;ures &s;hall be taken,&mdash;indeed I had concerted them previou&s;ly, without other inducement than pure di&s;intere&s;ted friend&s;hip,&mdash;which will complete your triumph, and the defeat of
<PB N="354" REF="364">your enemies, at one and the &s;ame in&s;tant.

Indeed, I am ambitious to de&s;erve the honour of an alliance with Sir Gui&s;e Stuart, by &s;aving his life <HI>before</HI> I receive the bright reward, the promi&s;e of which, &s;hould I even die my&s;elf in pre&s;erving you, I &s;hall think a full atone|ment; for, though I have not, like that puny lover, the &s;en&s;itive Henry Fitzorton, been playing at the game of declaration, I have an affection which&mdash;an affection which&mdash;but your dear life, my future parent, is in danger,&mdash;and this is no time to talk &s;enti|mentally about my pa&s;&s;ion:&mdash;&s;o, if you will con&s;ider of the&s;e little articles of family af|fection which I have drawn up, &s;uppo&s;ing the family convention between us to take place,&mdash;and ju&s;t put your name thereto, I will
<PB N="355" REF="365">clap the &s;addle on my hor&s;e to convey the glad tidings to Mrs. Tempe&s;t,&mdash;and return with &s;uch plans, and powers of putting them into execution, as &s;hall rid you of all your fears. Meantime, you will intimate nothing of what has pa&s;t, to your family, but wait my return, in a&s;&s;ured expectation that my life &s;hall be the guarantee of yours.&mdash;Alas! Sir Gui&s;e," continued Miles, taking the baronet by the hand, "what would have been the event, had not my ince&s;&s;ant vigi|lance and &s;ecret intelligence traced the helli&s;h plot now forming again&s;t you at the ca&s;tle! I am &s;orry to &s;ay, Henry is almo&s;t the ringleader; your own &s;on is not without a hand in the con&s;piracy; and in le&s;s than eight-and-forty hours, your death,&mdash;your concerted murder&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Eight-and-forty hours! Mercy defend me!"&mdash;cries the baronet.</P>
<P>"Your death, I &s;ay, within that time, would have been as certain, as will now be your pre&s;ervation."</P>
<P>At the end of this &s;entence, Sir Gui&s;e leaped on the neck of Miles, with the mo&s;t
<PB N="356" REF="366">extravagant demon&s;trations of joy,&mdash;called him and Tempe&s;t his only friends, protec|tors, and pre&s;ervers,&mdash;&s;wore they only &s;hould be his future heirs, his pre&s;ent a&s;oc;oci|ates,&mdash;declared he longed for the hour which &s;hould give to one the claims of a wife, and to the other tho&s;e of a &s;on,&mdash;and prote&s;ted he only waited till the forms of mourning for Lady Stuart were pa&s;t, per&s;onally to make a graceful offer. He then opened the paper which Miles had given, glanced his eye ha&s;ti|ly over the contents, which he approved,&mdash;caught up a pen and &s;igned his name,&mdash;call|ed in Denni&s;on and another dome&s;tic as wit|ne&s;&s;es, telling them it was a mere deed of tru&s;t,&mdash;di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them the in&s;tant they had made their &s;ignatures, and thus bound him|&s;elf to obligations, the nature of which he &s;carcely knew, being under terrors which would have induced him to &s;ign away the globe,&mdash;and again hugging Miles to his bo&s;om, and calling him his be&s;t friend, urged him not to &s;pare hor&s;e-fle&s;h, to greet Tem|pe&s;t with the mo&s;t lavi&s;h epithets of fondne&s;s, and to return with the utmo&s;t &s;peed; add|ing
<PB N="357" REF="367">as Miles departed, that he &s;hould not dare to take food, or re&s;t, till he again em|braced his dear Valentine,&mdash;&s;o the da&s;tard now called a man whom he had long feared and de&s;pi&s;ed, and &s;uch was the me&s;&s;age he &s;ent by that man to a woman who was both his aver&s;ion and his dread.</P>
<P>Miles had not left the room more than a minute, when he re-entered, &s;aying, as upon recollection, that, in his zeal to ac|compli&s;h the baronet's &s;afety, he had forgot all other matters, e&s;pecially to intimate that as the de&s;ign of counter-plotting the Fitz|ortons would be attended with con&s;iderable expence&mdash;</P>
<P>"I under&s;tand you," &s;aid Sir Gui&s;e, taking out &s;ome banker's checks, and &s;cribbling at random. "You will pa&s;s the hou&s;e: get the&s;e ca&s;hed: and &s;hould more be wanted, I have always &s;ome running ca&s;h with my country banker."</P>
<P>"We are wa&s;ting time," &s;aid Miles, pocketing the drafts. "God ble&s;s you! Expect me &s;oon. Be &s;ilent and be &s;afe!"</P>

<P>BUT, great as were the motives already a&s;&s;igned for this invention of plots and intended counterplots to work upon the fears of Sir Gui&s;e,&mdash;the inventor, and his fair a&s;&s;ociate, Mrs. Tempe&s;t, were influenced by other inducements, more potent than all the advantages they had hopes of deriving, in the i&s;&s;ue, from the operation of tho&s;e fears, and the well-connected fable on which they were founded.</P>
<P>The primary wheels in this grand ma|chine were the lu&s;t of revenge, and a lu&s;t yet more fordid, more violent, which the widow and her Valentine bore towards the Clares and Fitzortons.</P>
<P>Mr. Clare had been the fir&s;t to intimate to his friend Fitzorton, that there was &s;ome|thing more wicked, though better di&s;gui&s;ed, in the di&s;po&s;ition of Miles than that of the baronet,&mdash;adding that he had heard a &s;tory of his being drummed out of a regiment
<PB N="359" REF="369">&s;omewhere in Ireland, for mal-practices,&mdash; among&s;t which, "it hangs in my memory," &s;aid Mr. Clare,&mdash;"that theft and perjury were not the mo&s;t atrocious."</P>
<P>This happening to be communicated to Sir Armine in the pre&s;ence of one David Otley, a dome&s;tic of Mr. Clare's, and a &s;hrewd fellow, but to whom Mr. Clare was &s;omewhat attached, the caution reached, by this medium, the ear of Mr. Miles.&mdash; John Fitzorton had been at &s;ome pains to trace this rumour, not only in compliance with Mr. Clare's &s;u&s;picions, but in confirma|tion of his own, which had &s;ecretly fa&s;tened upon this man, even when he had the pri|vileges of a vi&s;itor at the ca&s;tle, in common with Sir Gui&s;e, who introduced him.&mdash;John &s;oon profited of tho&s;e opportunities which his military connexions gave him, and made a report at the ca&s;tle, not covertly, but con|&s;i&s;tent with the intrepid deci&s;ion of his cha|racter.</P>
<P>One day, when the &s;ame David Otley was waiting at the back of his ma&s;ter's chair, and when, indeed, Sir Gui&s;e him&s;elf,&mdash;it
<PB N="360" REF="370">being prior to the public breach,&mdash;was at Sir Armine's table,&mdash;"It is matter of a&s;toni&s;h|ment to me," &s;aid John, who happened to be the only per&s;on of his family then pre&s;ent, "that a fellow who has every vice in human nature, but cowardice,&mdash;and that &s;ingle ex|ception proceeding only from a fearle&s;s con&s;titutional impudence,&mdash;&s;hould gain the protection of any per&s;on of credit."</P>
<P>Then turning to Sir Gui&s;e, he added, "If, on your return to the abbey, you &s;hould meet with a friend of yours who an&s;wers to this character, do me the honour, &s;ir, to tell him what I have &s;aid. And farther, &s;hould his being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ingle quality I have alluded to, namely, his in|&s;olent courage, be thought a counterbalance for the &s;tain of every ba&s;ene&s;s, by the u&s;e and exerci&s;e <HI>you</HI> may have for it, Sir Gui&s;e, I have only to de&s;ire, in the name of my fa|mily, that the gentleman who may be &s;o gifted, from this moment for evermore, may forbear coming to the ca&s;tle,&mdash;and I think I may venture to add, or the manor-hou&s;e."</P>
<P><PB N="361" REF="371">It is unnece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that this pointed me&s;&s;age was carried, at the time, to the party concerned.&mdash;Indeed, le&s;t any thing &s;hould be lo&s;t in its journey from the ca&s;tle to the abbey, it was kindly taken to the latter man&s;ion by two per&s;ons.&mdash;Sir Gui&s;e faithfully related it, the very &s;ame night, to Mr. Valentine Miles; and David Otley took it in his budget of ca&s;tle and manor-hou&s;e in|telligence, the next morning.</P>
<P>A natural con&s;equence, ari&s;ing from this inhibition, was, of cour&s;e, cutting the ac|quaintance of Mr. Miles: but another very natural con&s;equence, of cour&s;e <HI>al&s;o,</HI> took place between the truly brave John Fitz|orton and the truly audacious Valentine Miles.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was the latter in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the favourable &s;entiments borne him by the former, than he &s;ent, in turn, a &s;carce le&s;s civil me&s;&s;age to John, who in&s;tantly ob&s;erved the contents, without &s;o much as uttering a &s;yllable to any of the family, &s;ave and ex|cept to True George, then <HI>his</HI> dome&s;tic.&mdash; Miles had contrived to get the baronet to
<PB N="362" REF="372">accompany him to the place of rendezvous, without letting him know the de&s;ign.&mdash;Ac|cordingly, the parties met at the dawn of the third day from the communication of John's opinion.&mdash;At the &s;ight of John, who&s;e very countenance was a rebuke to cowardice, Sir Gui&s;e involuntarily drew back a few paces; and the view of the pi&s;|tols, a brace of which both antagoni&s;ts took out of their pockets at the &s;ame time, made him &s;o expert at the &s;cience of tergi|ver&s;ation, that he had got &s;everal yards in his way home, exclaiming, "Miles had be|trayed him,"&mdash;before the &s;aid Miles per|ceived he had taken fright.&mdash;Valentine, however, who wanted him as a witne&s;s of that prowe&s;s which might be one day of service in his own cau&s;e, &s;oon brought him back, a&s;&s;erting, that "<HI>He</HI> was in no dan|ger:"&mdash;and the duelli&s;ts prepared for ac|tion.</P>
<P>John conde&s;cended only to &s;ay, &s;ternly, "Fellow, I am admitting you to an unde|&s;erved honour."&mdash;Then &s;ettling their di|&s;tance, and taking aim, almo&s;t in the &s;ame
<PB N="363" REF="373">in&s;tant John di&s;charged his &s;hot and re|ceived that of Miles, without any injury to either.&mdash;John's ball, however, whizzed &s;o near to the body of Sir Gui&s;e, who had &s;hifted about, that the good baronet again took to his heels, and George after him, leaving the field of battle &s;olely to the com|batants.&mdash;John's next ball took effect in the neck of his adver&s;ary, who dropping on the ground, John demanded "if he was &s;atisfied with his being &s;till of opinion he was a &s;coun|drel:" &mdash;and upon being an&s;wered by Valen|tine that "he was &s;atisfied for the pre&s;ent,"&mdash; John left him to the care of True George, who by this time returned without the fearful game of which he had been in cha&s;e.&mdash;John now walked home, &s;aying to True George, "When you have conveyed that fellow to the abbey, return to me at the ca&s;tle; and do not inform any of my family, I have di&s;|graced either them or my&s;elf, by &s;uch a con|te&s;t, I charge you.&mdash;And as for you, &s;ir," added he, addre&s;&s;ing Miles, as George lifted him from the ground,&mdash;"if you live, and are again as impudent as you are infamous,
<PB N="364" REF="374">I may be tempted to confer on you the dig|nity of a &s;econd leaden token of my e&s;teem for your virtues: and if you die, public ho|nours ought to be adjudged me, for being the author of that ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing to the community, your invaluable death!"</P>
<P>Although neither John, who was too much a&s;hamed of his exploit, nor True George, who was too faithful to his tru&s;t, revealed this tran&s;action to any other per|&s;on at home or abroad,&mdash;and, perhaps, both had long &s;ince thrown it from their memo|ries, as unworthy of pre&s;ervation,&mdash;the whole bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;till &s;marting in the re|collection of Miles, who,&mdash;although he did not think proper to call John to a &s;econd account, nor to a&s;&s;ign it among&s;t his mo|tives for taking part in the vengeance of Sir Gui&s;e,&mdash;had been inwardly con&s;uming with the mo&s;t implacable hatred to the whole family ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>He had, indeed, long watched his occa|&s;ion,&mdash;had a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly, though &s;ecretly, fo|mented every cau&s;e and effect of hatred in the baronet,&mdash;and was almo&s;t in de&s;pair of
<PB N="365" REF="375">an opportunity falling out &s;uitable to his de&s;ign, when at length he came to the knowledge of circum&s;tances which will pre&s;ently be no &s;ecret to the reader, and which, if well managed, he did not doubt, would produce a rich harve&s;t of events fa|vourable to his love, his avarice, and his vengeance.&mdash;The fabrication of the well|timed &s;tory of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of Sir Gui&s;e was &s;imply a nece&s;&s;ary prelude to the bringing this about; and, as to the degree of probability of the tale, he was the le&s;s care|ful to con&s;truct it, as he had often perceived that when the baronet's terrors were once excited by a &s;udden &s;hock, none of his fa|culties were &s;ufficiently at his command to reflect how the hi&s;tory hung together, or how the parts were in harmony with the whole.&mdash;On the contrary, every &s;en&s;e &s;eemed to take the alarm, at the moment he heard of a po&s;&s;ible danger; and, like an affrighted family running from a hou&s;e at the cry of fire, every pa&s;&s;ion of his &s;oul, but that of fear, left his bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Now, in accounting for the hatred
<PB N="366" REF="376">which the widow Tempe&s;t bore to the hou&s;e of Fitzorton, we fear we mu&s;t be un|der the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity of telling yet another Family Secret, and one which a more prudent biographer would conceal. But the truth, that guides our pen, demands the di&s;covery; and the human nature, to which our hi&s;tory is dedicated, mu&s;t plead excu&s;e for whatever offences the develope|ment of my&s;teries behind her curtain may bring to light.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XL.</HEAD>
<P>HENRY became acquainted with Mrs. Tempe&s;t, without knowing any thing of her attachment to Valentine Miles, or her con|nexion with Sir Gui&s;e Stuart.&mdash;The time was critical.</P>
<P>It was during Henry's vi&s;it in London to a female relation: and his fir&s;t interview happened at a very remarkable moment.&mdash; It was, in truth, in the evening of the day on which, with his accu&s;tomed punctuality and
<PB N="367" REF="377">ardour, he had di&s;patched a large pacquet of "everla&s;ting love and con&s;tancy" to his dear Caroline, under cover to the tru&s;ty Denni&s;on.</P>
<P>The &s;oft duty of his heart di&s;charged, he went to the theatre, full of the tendere&s;t vows, the fonde&s;t ideas; but having made, in company with &s;ome young friends, larger libations to the purple god of the grape, or rather, to the health of his beloved, than his rea&s;on could bear, though his pa&s;&s;ion &s;eemed to augment at every gla&s;s,&mdash;he hap|pened to walk, we had almo&s;t written, <HI>&s;tagger,</HI> into a box, where the widow was then &s;miling at Mr. Congreve's plea&s;ant co|medy of Love for Love. Seeing a place to the left vacant, and near a beautiful lady, the right &s;ide being occupied by another fe|male, who appeared to be in the character of a foil, rather than of a rival brilliant,&mdash; he made one of tho&s;e bows which were &s;ure to procure him a gracious reception; and, perceiving his welcome in&s;ured, by the brilliant's &s;itting clo&s;er to the foil, in
<PB N="368" REF="378">order to make more room for him,&mdash;he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;eat.</P>
<P>Rather as an effect of high youth and high &s;pirits animated by love and wine, than a &s;pirit of gallantry, he entered at once into &s;ome glowing remarks on the &s;cene which was then repre&s;enting.&mdash;The lady being one of tho&s;e females who follow fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, and have the talent of being de&s;perately in love at a glance, contrived to forget, in the &s;pace of half an hour, that Sir Gui&s;e Stuart (for it was his widow Tem|pe&s;t) had any claims for money, or her Valentine Miles for love,&mdash;or, indeed, that Mr. Congreve had any wit, or that her mu&s;e companion required any more of her at|tention than if &s;he had been part of the bench &s;he &s;at on,&mdash;or, in &s;hort, that there was any body but the enchanting young &s;tranger at her &s;ide in the creation.&mdash;She pre|&s;ently gave the youth &s;uch manife&s;t and manifold proofs of her &s;o thinking, by cer|tain little tenderne&s;&s;es, innuendoes, langui&s;h|ing looks, and gentle pre&s;&s;ures, every one
<PB N="369" REF="379">of which,&mdash;though they were perfectly new to him,&mdash;being altogether in a different &s;tyle from the attentions of the cha&s;te and charm|ing Caroline,&mdash;it was impo&s;&s;ible for him not to comprehend their meaning: and be|fore the couples in the <HI>comedy</HI> were brought tegether in the la&s;t act, an union of a dif|ferent kind was &s;ettled in the lady's mind, and ratified in her eyes, which &s;eemed to <HI>in&s;i&s;t</HI> on the con&s;ent of the young gentleman. &mdash;In a word, the widow thought her new object&mdash;and, indeed, &s;he decided rightly&mdash; one of the hand&s;ome&s;t and mo&s;t elegant young men &s;he had ever &s;een,&mdash;and, agree|ably to <HI>her</HI> fir&s;t-&s;ight &s;y&s;tem, was, by the time the fir&s;t act of the farce was over, <HI>in love with him to di&s;traction!</HI></P>
<P>It is probable &s;he heard not a &s;entence of act the &s;econd, though it was upon a &s;ub|ject congenial to her feelings: &s;o entirely was &s;he engro&s;&s;ed by her new conqueror. At the conclu&s;ion, common gallantry required he &s;hould &s;ee her &s;afe out of the hou&s;e, and put her and her &s;till dumb companion into their carriage,&mdash;to which as he was hand|ing
<PB N="370" REF="380">them, the widow &s;aid, even as &s;he &s;et her foot on the &s;tep, "I hope, &s;ir, I &s;hall have the honour to &s;et you down, in re|turn for your civility."&mdash;Which offer be|ing accompanied by certain invi&s;ible &s;igns and tokens, as potent as the &s;ecrets of free|ma&s;onry, or the ancient art of palmi&s;try,&mdash; Henry got into the coach, and &s;eated him|&s;elf on the &s;ame &s;ide, without attending to the other lady quite &s;o much as the forms of politene&s;s might &s;eem to pre&s;cribe.</P>
<P>Henry, new to the town, thought it right, in point of etiquette, to &s;ee the lady home, before he took the liberty of u&s;ing her carriage, which was, therefore, driven to a very hand&s;ome hou&s;e in Gro&s;venor Square; where, alighting to hand the ladies out, it is certainly <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> that Henry might have taken leave of his ladies, had not the &s;prightly widow &s;portingly exclaimed, with certain accompaniments, having &s;till hold of his arm, "We may as well make it the romance of a night, &s;ir, if you are not better engaged:&mdash;for you mu&s;t know, I dreamed of an adventure of this &s;ort, and
<PB N="371" REF="381">am ju&s;t in the humour to have my dream out.&mdash;What &s;ay you, Pri&s;cilla?"&mdash;turning to her companion.&mdash;"I &s;hould like it of all things:" replied the lady.&mdash;Henry was not in a di&s;po&s;ition to be rude: &s;o the widow in|formed the coachman &s;he &s;hould have no farther occa&s;ion for the carriage; and the <HI>trio</HI> of choice &s;pirits tripped into the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Voluptuous elegance now began its fa&s;|cination.&mdash;A collation was &s;oon &s;erved up, after which the &s;ervants di&s;appeared; the mo&s;t co&s;tly wines circulated; for neither the widow nor her companion was un|known to the jolly god; and either of them would have taken off her bottle, with more ea&s;e than Olivia Clare, or Caroline Stuart, or any &s;uch "puny whip&s;ter" of the &s;ex, could have managed her fir&s;t and half &s;ipped her &s;econd gla&s;s.</P>
<P>Indeed, our fair &s;educers were frequent votaries at the court of Comus, in&s;omuch that Mrs. Tempe&s;t might have repre&s;ented, and, in truth, often <HI>did</HI> repre&s;ent, upon the &s;tage of life, the part of Euphro&s;yne; and
<PB N="372" REF="382">her a&s;&s;ociate had as often done equal ju&s;|tice to the character of the principal bac|chante.</P>
<P>It is with reluctance we tell the reader that Henry was not &s;o much alarmed at finding him&s;elf in &s;uch company, as was Milton's lady when &s;he di&s;covered the dan|ger of <HI>her</HI> &s;ituation;&mdash;yet the &s;ituation was but too &s;imilar with re&s;pect to the &s;urround|ing magic.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tempe&s;t was, in all &s;en&s;es of the character, a &s;yren.&mdash;Her voice, though neither &s;weet nor tender, either like that of Olivia or Caroline, was yet &s;eductively harmonious.&mdash;Her eyes, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing neither the mode&s;t lu&s;tre of Olivia's, nor the appealing &s;oftne&s;s of Caroline's, darted &s;uch intolerable fire through her long dark eye|la&s;hes, that a le&s;s ardent gazer than Henry might have been &s;corched by their burning beams.&mdash;She was &s;omewhat under the &s;ize of Olivia, and, by the &s;ame proportion, above that of Caroline:&mdash;&s;he wanted the cha&s;te dignity that gave command to the one, and was utterly de&s;titute of the inter|e&s;ting
<PB N="373" REF="383">graces, &s;hifting with every attitude, that adorned the other.&mdash;But &s;he had to boa&s;t a &s;ymmetry of &s;hape, a certain volup|tuous roundne&s;s of limbs, a <HI>contour</HI> of vi&s;age, and an alluring government of countenance, &s;o entirely the rever&s;e of both, that while <HI>their</HI> features were formed to <HI>in&s;truct</HI> the beholder that real beauty, love, and vir|tue, were the &s;ame,&mdash;tho&s;e of the widow were calculated to excite, &s;uddenly, a train of impetuous emotions, formed to &s;educe from the youthful bo&s;om all its heavenly guards, and lure the gazer to indulge in the fatal contra&s;t.&mdash;All the lineaments of her face offered the mo&s;t infallible marks of pa&s;&s;ion unre&s;trained, an inordinate love of plea&s;ure, and a total di&s;dain of the decent laws by which pa&s;&s;ion and plea&s;ure, and more e&s;pecially in women, ought to be re|gulated.&mdash;Her lips were in exact corre|&s;pondence with her eyes, and as con&s;tantly employed in expre&s;&s;ing the &s;ame emotions; and the regularity and colour of her teeth could only yield to the beauty of her arms and bo&s;om, which were in the highe&s;t per|fection
<PB N="374" REF="384">of female loveline&s;s, but were di&s;|played or &s;haded with a &s;tudied attention, that denoted &s;he was at once proud and con&s;cious of their attraction.</P>
<P>The then extreme youth of Henry, the novelty of the &s;ituation, the combining en|chantments, and the &s;tate of the poor lad's head, will, we hope, mitigate his offence, &s;hould we own, as own we mu&s;t, that he was far from being a mere neutral li&s;tener or looker on during the hilarities of the even|ing.&mdash;He looked at the widow, indeed, with a timid admiration: and as &s;he &s;ung &s;everal couplets from the <HI>l' Allegro,</HI> Henry's manly and pathetic voice, which the reader has already heard celebrated, joined in the chorus, with a &s;pirit that &s;hewed he had been gradually enchanted <HI>out of him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>"Here's a health to tho&s;e that we love." cries the widow, filling the gla&s;s while &s;he &s;ung.</P>
<P>"Here's a health to tho&s;e that love <HI>us!</HI>' an&s;wered her companion, in the &s;ame &s;tyle, putting the bottle, which contained &s;ome excellent champaigne, to Henry, who then,
<PB N="375" REF="385">for the fir&s;t time, probably, &s;ince the intox|ication began, blu&s;hed and &s;ighed, as at the remembrance of Caroline.</P>
<P>This, however, though noticed by the piercing eyes of the widow, was con&s;trued rather into growing pa&s;&s;ion for her&s;elf, than tenderne&s;s for another.&mdash;With renewed fervency, therefore, &s;he proceeded with the &s;ong, increa&s;ing in animation as &s;he went on;&mdash;and when they came to the following line, which the widow trilled with uncom|mon melody, <Q>O my love, lov'&s;t thou me?</Q> &s;he ca&s;t an enflaming and decided look at Henry; and her redundant hair dropt from its &s;light bondage, and covered her with its luxurious mantle.</P>
<P>The heart of Henry mu&s;t have been made of "impenetrable &s;tuff," indeed, had he, at &s;uch a time, in &s;uch a place, and at &s;uch an opportunity, affected not to under&s;tand the drift of &s;uch a que&s;tion, breathed in har|mony, through the lips of beauty.</P>
<P>The companion, on &s;ome pretence or
<PB N="376" REF="386">other, withdrew; and the very few remains of mode&s;ty, which had been reluctantly confined in the room before, followed her, or rather flew blu&s;hingly out of the apartment, the moment the door opened, and &s;eemed to wi&s;h for an a&s;ylum in Caroline's or Oli|via's bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tempe&s;t and Henry were now toge|ther; and very few moments more might have completed the triumph of youthful folly and infidelity, had not Henry's good angel, in the <HI>imaged</HI> form of Caroline her&s;elf, interpo&s;ed:&mdash;and that pure image was brought forward even by Mrs. Tempe&s;t her&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Come, one more brimmer to the wo|man of your heart," &s;aid Mrs. Tempe&s;t, re|pleni&s;hing her own, and then Henry's gla&s;s. "This one bumper more, thou enchanting &s;tranger! who&mdash;without my knowledge of, or de&s;ire to know, thy name, family, fortune, or aught but thy enchanting <HI>&s;elf,</HI>&mdash;ha&s;t turned a moment of time into an age of love!"</P>
<P>She quoted, theatrically, various rhap&s;o|dies
<PB N="377" REF="387">from the old dramatic poets: and then &s;eizing Henry's hand, every artery of which trembled, &s;he pre&s;&s;ed it to her lips, ex|claiming, "Ah! dear unknown, tell me who &s;he is?&mdash;What is her name?&mdash;Who&s;e health am I to drink?&mdash;Who is my too happy rival?&mdash;For to &s;uppo&s;e&mdash;to flatter my&s;elf, I have the bli&s;s to find the heart of &s;uch a love-in&s;piring fellow unengaged&mdash;and &s;till at liberty to devote it&s;elf to this throbbing brea&s;t&mdash;"</P>
<P>She thought proper to he&s;itate, and imi|tate ba&s;hful difficulty,&mdash;then went on&mdash;</P>
<P>"To dare even hope that I meet &s;uch a trea&s;ure undi&s;po&s;ed of, is a bli&s;s too great! too mighty!&mdash;No, 'twas too pre&s;umptuous! and yet to think this hand, tho&s;e lips, that form, this panting heart another's&mdash;O! it would de&s;troy me!&mdash;By my &s;oul it would!"</P>
<P>After a trembling pau&s;e, &s;he cried, "You are &s;ilent&mdash;you blu&s;h&mdash;your lips turn pale&mdash; and, good heavens!&mdash;ah! what do I &s;ee? there are tears in your eyes!&mdash;Accur&s;ed fortune!&mdash;perhaps, perhaps you love!&mdash;
<PB N="378" REF="388">confu&s;ion! perhaps&mdash;no, you are not&mdash;&s;urely you are not <HI>married!</HI>&mdash;but if you are&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Cur&s;e! as the &s;weet poet &s;ays,&mdash;cur&s;e on <HI>all</HI> laws but tho&s;e which love has made!"</P>
<Q><L>Love, free as air, at &s;ight of human <HI>ties</HI></L>
<L>Spreads its light wing and in a moment flies!</L></Q>

<P>HAVING fini&s;hed her poetical ju&s;tifica|tions, which have been many a pretty liber|tine's, and tripping lady's apology, &s;he ob|&s;erved Henry extremely troubled.</P>
<P>"What can be the matter with you?&mdash; Yes, I know my fate.&mdash;It is not the fetters of wedlock <HI>only</HI> I have to contend with:&mdash; the&s;e might be broken&mdash;the&s;e, I could &s;nap a&s;under;&mdash;but, you are bound in the chains of <HI>love</HI>&mdash;almighty love!&mdash;and I&mdash;wretched woman!&mdash;But I am re&s;olved to know all.&mdash;
<PB N="379" REF="389">Here, &s;ince you cannot &s;peak the cruel word, write&mdash;write the dreaded name&mdash;write on the back of this letter, and with my pencil&mdash; there&mdash;who am I to hate&mdash;cur&s;e&mdash;extermi|nate?&mdash;mark the dete&s;ted name."</P>
<P>"<HI>Dete&s;ted</HI> name!" reiterated Henry: "oh! &s;he is an angel! and her precious name would be profaned, were I to breathe it now with the&s;e unfaithful lips, to tho&s;e polluted ones which have tempted me to injure her."</P>
<P>"<HI>Polluted</HI> lips!" in her turn re-echoed the widow, &s;pringing up, and di&s;dainfully withdrawing her hand from Henry's,&mdash; "<HI>Polluted lips!</HI>&mdash;have a care, &s;ir!&mdash;you do not perhaps know, that, as I can doat to di&s;traction, &s;o can I abhor to madne&s;s!&mdash; yes, and both with equal &s;peed!&mdash;<HI>Polluted lips!</HI>&mdash;they have &s;eldom been rewarded for their partiality by &s;uch an epithet!"</P>
<P>She took the room three or four times, backwards and forwards, in a violent pa&s;&s;ion, &s;ometimes throwing her&s;elf down into a chair, &s;ometimes to&s;&s;ing by Henry, without
<PB N="380" REF="390">deigning to mark her rage, except through the fla&s;hes of her indignant eyes,&mdash;from which &s;hot now as inten&s;e flames of fury, as had, a few moments before, darted burning beams of de&s;ire.&mdash;Her whole per&s;on was rendered terrifying, and might perhaps have alarmed Henry, though by no means apt to be appalled, had not another object, more fraught with terrors than an hundred thou&s;and angry men or even women, with an equal number of armed troops in their train, fa&s;tened upon his attention, namely, the &s;ight of the <HI>addre&s;s</HI> of that letter which the widow had produced for the purpo&s;e of his penciling her rival's name, and which the &s;aid widow had hurled in di&s;dain upon the &s;ofa, where Henry and &s;he had before been &s;eated.</P>
<P>This &s;uper&s;cription opened on Henry's eyes the following di&s;coveries&mdash;fir&s;t, that he had entangled him&s;elf, almo&s;t pa&s;t redemp|tion, in an affair of gallantry with the mi&s;|tre&s;s of his beloved Caroline's father! and &s;econdly, that it was directed to the &s;aid
<PB N="381" REF="391">father's mi&s;tre&s;s, in the well-known hand|writing of Sir Gui&s;e Stuart!</P>
<P>"Merciful Heaven!" exclaimed Henry, &mdash;"what do I &s;ee?&mdash;is it po&s;&s;ible, madam, you &s;hould be Mrs. Tempe&s;t?"</P>
<P>"And what <HI>then,</HI> &s;ir?" demanded the widow, &s;natching the letter from Henry, and throwing it into the fire with a dreadful execration.</P>
<P>"<HI>That</HI> Mrs. Tempe&s;t, continued Henry, of whom I have heard &s;o much?&mdash;whom Sir Gui&s;e Stu&mdash;?"</P>
<P>"And who then are <HI>you?</HI>" que&s;tioned the widow, &s;topping him in the middle of the name.&mdash;"Are you that enemy of mine, his dete&s;ted &s;on, who&s;e hate I have long felt, but who&s;e per&s;on I have never yet&mdash;"</P>
<P>"No, Madam!" replied Henry, inter|rupting in his turn,&mdash;"I am not &s;o great, &s;o ju&s;t, &s;o honourable a man, as that noble, that di&s;tingui&s;hed youth, whom I now blu&s;h to call my friend!&mdash;but, unworthy as I am, I ble&s;s heaven for this timely di&s;covery,&mdash; this miraculous e&s;cape!"</P>
<P>Henry caught up his hat, and, without
<PB N="382" REF="392">con&s;idering the latene&s;s of the hour, or any thing el&s;e but what he had mentioned, hur|ried to the door.</P>
<P>"E&s;cape!&mdash;e&s;cape!&mdash;in&s;olent!&mdash;impu|dent!" &mdash;raved forth Mrs. Tempe&s;t, running after him, and pulling him back.&mdash;"Con|fu&s;ion to my &s;oul!&mdash;if you provoke me,&mdash; who&s;oever you are, were you the father who gave me life&mdash;"</P>
<P>Henry &s;truggled in her gra&s;p:&mdash;and a violent rapping at the &s;treet door made him &s;tep a few paces back.</P>
<P>The lady exclaimed, &s;till keeping her hold, and perfectly agonized with rage, &s;haking Henry while &s;he &s;poke,&mdash;"God be thanked!&mdash;that is either Valentine or Sir Gui&s;e!&mdash;now, &s;ir, will <HI>my triumph</HI> be com|plete!"</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;aid this, a noi&s;e was heard upon the &s;tairs; and pre&s;ently the former of the above-mentioned per&s;ons made his appear+ance.</P>
<P>He had come to town, as the reader may remember, po&s;t ha&s;te, on the bu&s;ine&s;s of Jane Atwood. Arriving with Sir Gui&s;e in the
<PB N="383" REF="393">middle of the night, and having left the baro|net in Jane's lodgings, which had been pro|vided by Miles,&mdash;he, Miles, had made up his excu&s;e for vi&s;iting the widow at &s;o un&s;ea|&s;onable an hour, as at that time he ob|&s;erved &s;ome etiquette with her.</P>
<P>At the &s;ight of Henry, whom he had &s;een more than once at the abbey, and who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion for Caroline he had heard from Sir Gui&s;e, he &s;tarted, as at that of an appa|rition.</P>
<P>"Mr. Henry Fitzorton!" exclaimed he.</P>
<P>"Who?&mdash;Henry Fitzorton!" cried the widow.&mdash;"No wonder, then, the&s;e unheard-of outrages have been heaped on me!&mdash;and I have not the &s;malle&s;t doubt, but that one wickedne&s;s would have led to another, till it had ended in my death!&mdash;oh, Valentine! &mdash;&s;ure heaven &s;ent you at this moment to my re&s;cue!&mdash;could you conceive what I have endured from this, till now, un|known wretch,&mdash;your heart would bleed for me!"</P>
<P>She then related the foregore &s;cene, &s;o as exactly to rever&s;e the &s;everal actual circum|&s;tances,
<PB N="384" REF="394">ob&s;erving, with an admirable accu|racy of tran&s;po&s;ition, that, "he had rudely &s;eated him&s;elf in the &s;ame box at the play|hou&s;e,&mdash;watched her out,&mdash;thru&s;t him&s;elf into her coach,&mdash;ran up &s;tairs as &s;oon as they got home,&mdash;forced poor Pri&s;cilla, her companion, out of the room,&mdash;locked the door,&mdash;&s;wore that he would de&s;troy the fir&s;t per&s;on who offered to approach,&mdash;and, on ca&s;ting his eye upon a letter &s;he had re|ceived from her dear, dear Sir Gui&s;e, who&s;e hand-writing he knew, he &s;landered both him and Valentine, with a volley of exe|crations,&mdash;and was proceeding to every thing &s;hocking, when her good &s;tars brought her friend Valentine to her aid!&mdash;'Twas &s;urely providence," &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he had fini&s;hed this &s;peech, which the gentleman whom &s;he addre&s;&s;ed believed as much of as &s;he did her&s;elf,&mdash;yet the former thought it might be mo&s;t pro|ductive to give it credit,&mdash;Valentine went into another room, ob&s;erving, "he &s;hould return in a moment."</P>
<P>The widow then &s;allied up to Henry, and,
<PB N="385" REF="395">in a malicious whi&s;per, accompanied by a &s;arca&s;tic &s;neer, her arms akimbo, demanded, "whether he thought another miracle would happen, to befriend his <HI>e&s;cape</HI> from the ven|geance of her injured friend!"</P>
<P>Henry di&s;dained to make her any reply; and indeed, before he could have done &s;o, Miles returned with his pi&s;tols, at the &s;ight of which, Mrs. Tempe&s;t, affecting to be alarmed, flung her&s;elf on her knees, and interceded for the life of Henry;&mdash;then, by a gentle whi&s;per, &s;ugge&s;ted to Miles, "that if the outrage were well managed, it would be worth more to them both, than a million of &s;uch lives."&mdash;This interce&s;&s;ion wrought &s;o on the tender heart of Miles, that all would have gone off, for the moment, with a gentle reprimand or menace, had not Henry,&mdash;who felt the Fitzorton blood ru&s;h in boiling torrents through his veins, walked towards Valentine, and &s;napping his fingers in his face, ob&s;erved loftily, "that the trick was too &s;tale, and that, as he was too infa|mous a wretch to be met on a level by a man of honour, who&s;e family had ju&s;tly
<PB N="386" REF="396">bani&s;hed him from their pre&s;ence, he &s;hould be warranted to treat him in the only way &s;uch a &s;coundrel was entitled to, if he did not let him pa&s;s out of the <HI>private brothel</HI> which Sir Gui&s;e and him&s;elf kept between them.&mdash;"I have concealed your vile &s;ecret, which has been long communicated to me by the injured Charles, only out of delicacy to my angel.&mdash;I will no more &s;ully her pure name by breathing it in a pe&s;t hou&s;e.&mdash;But, if an accent, re&s;pecting the &s;hameful com|pany into which I have been trepanned by that vicious and artful woman, is mentioned either in my hearing, or in that of any per|&s;on dear to me, and it &s;hould reach me, I will &s;et fire to a train that &s;hall de&s;troy you both!&mdash;&s;o be warned."</P>
<P>It was with great difficulty Miles now held the arms of Mrs. Tempe&s;t, who mad|dened with rage, &s;hame, and di&s;appoint|ment. &mdash;Miles was him&s;elf &s;carce le&s;s in|flamed: but certain ideas ro&s;e in his mind &s;uddenly, that induced him to let Henry go unmole&s;ted out of the room, and al&s;o to hold the widow by main force till the &s;treet door
<PB N="387" REF="397">was &s;hut, even to the hazard of Valentine's own face, which received &s;everal lu&s;ty blows;&mdash;but, when Henry was fairly off, it did not take either much pains or time to convince the lady, that, "though her whole &s;tory was <HI>well put together,</HI> he knew it had not one &s;yllable of truth in it, and that, even had it been as veritable as it was fal&s;e, it would be better for all parties to hu&s;h up the affair at pre&s;ent.&mdash;Till we provoke the &s;tripling farther, he will keep <HI>our</HI> &s;ecret for the &s;ake of <HI>his own;</HI> and the bringing upon us the fury of Charles, and of the d *** d Fitzortons,&mdash;and, in con&s;equence of our ill|timed re&s;entment, arou&s;ing that ne&s;t of hornets, the magi&s;trates,&mdash;would ruin the fruit of tho&s;e plans which a little di&s;cre|tion will mature.&mdash;And as to Sir Gui&s;e him&s;elf," added Miles, archly,&mdash;"it would be as impo&s;&s;ible to per&s;uade him as me, or indeed your&s;elf, that a young fellow &s;hould come here, and drink champaigne, or bur|gundy,&mdash;which, I perceive by the&s;e tell-tale bottles, has been the ca&s;e,&mdash;without your con&s;ent, unle&s;s he committed a rape upon
<PB N="388" REF="398">the key of your cellar al&s;o!&mdash;No!&mdash;no!&mdash; let us be merry and wi&s;e, my dear widow: leave the event of this bu&s;ine&s;s with me.&mdash;I have a memory and mind, very faithful to my re&s;entments; and depend upon it, when opportunity favours, though it &s;hould be the length of the &s;iege of Troy before it ar|rives, I &s;hall cheri&s;h the fre&s;he&s;t recollec|tion of whatever has been done or &s;aid in this bu&s;ine&s;s, even down to the &s;aucy &s;nap of his fingers in my face, which <HI>his heart's deare&s;t blood</HI> &s;hall one day pay for!&mdash;no matter!&mdash;leave the <HI>thoughts</HI> of revenge to me.&mdash;When time is ripe, do you a&s;&s;i&s;t the deed; and depend on it, we &s;hall both be &s;atisfied."</P>
<P>This con&s;ideration pacified her; and as Miles knew Sir Gui&s;e was &s;afely di&s;po&s;ed of in the apartments of the deluded Jane Atwood for the night, he entered into the explanations he thought fit to make the widow for his untimely vi&s;it; and the ami|able pair retired, after the bu&s;tles of the night, to the con&s;olation of each other's faithful arms.</P>
<P><PB N="389" REF="399">But, though this happy couple, recon|ciled by mutual deception, were &s;atisfied with each other, they were by no means &s;o with Henry:&mdash;for, notwith&s;tanding the happy turn which the widow gave to the affair at the time, and her ince&s;&s;ant a&s;&s;u|rances &s;ince, &s;o often as it was mentioned, it was beyond the reach of policy, ca&s;ui&s;|try, or the mo&s;t &s;olemn oaths, to make Va|lentine believe there had not been &s;ome previous intercour&s;e between Henry and her&s;elf, and that he caught them only in &s;ome quarrel of love, which would have ended in the u&s;ual way, had not his coming at the moment made it expedient for her to <HI>pretend</HI> violence, outrage, and di&s;plea|&s;ure.&mdash;And the idea did not a little ag|gravate the hate he bore to the Fitzortons, who appeared, at every turn, the bane of his purpo&s;es.&mdash;Indeed, John and Henry were now alike dete&s;table to him, e&s;pecially as at this time the per&s;on of Mrs. Tempe&s;t, &mdash;though, for rea&s;ons good, he con&s;ented to divide her with Sir Gui&s;e,&mdash;was not then indifferent to him: for he had only begun
<PB N="390" REF="400">to plot alienating the affections of the re|cently &s;educed Jane from the baronet.</P>
<P>And as to Mrs. Tempe&s;t her&s;elf, the &s;ud|den gu&s;t of love&mdash;or by whatever other name the reader thinks it ought to be called, for Henry, was pre&s;ently &s;ucceeded by as &s;udden an aver&s;ion, when &s;he found that no le&s;s than three penitently-<HI>tender</HI> letters, and one madly <HI>accu&s;ing</HI> epi&s;tle, which &s;he cau&s;ed to be clande&s;tinely delivered to him by the means of David Otley, produced <HI>not one word of reply.</HI></P>
<P>The caution, and dread of con&s;equences, however, &s;ugge&s;ted by Miles, re&s;trained her from public and avowed revenge; but the thir&s;t of vengeance kept raging within, and threatened one day to bur&s;t upon his head. Meantime, &s;he availed her&s;elf of more than one occa&s;ion to do him &s;ecret mi&s;chief, by way of giving earne&s;t of her future de&s;igns.&mdash; The anonymous letters to John and his fa|ther, re&s;pecting Caroline, were from this lady's pen:&mdash;and had &s;he known, at the time, his &s;ituation with Olivia, that would probably have been the &s;ubject of a third
<PB N="391" REF="401">epi&s;tle.&mdash;Why &s;he did not, &s;ince that, do him this kindne&s;s al&s;o, is yet in our confidence, and al&s;o, the farther proof, in her in&s;tance, how great truth there is in that celebrated di&s;tich of the poet&mdash;</P>
<Q><L>Heav'n has no plague like love to hatred turn'd,</L>
<L>Nor Hell a fury like a woman &s;corn'd.</L></Q>
<P>In regard to Henry, candid reader, his error, and his repentance, are both before you.&mdash;His tre&s;pa&s;s, and his temptations, have been delineated.</P>
<P>We are writing certain parts of the hi&s;|tory of Human Nature, the incon&s;i&s;tencies of which, we mu&s;t again repeat, it is our office rather to de&s;cribe than account for.&mdash; The foregoing &s;cene has nothing irrecon|cilable with the frail though intere&s;ting &s;ubject of our book, the human heart; and it is to be wi&s;hed that every young man who <HI>began</HI> an adventure of this kind as im|prudently, might <HI>fini&s;h</HI> it as amiably as Hen|ry Fitzorton.</P>
<P>To &s;uppo&s;e that this his approach to infidelity will recommend him to the vir|tuous

<HEAD>CHAPTER XLII.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT the time that the di&s;a&s;trous Hen|ry left the abbey, the impatient Olivia bent her &s;teps toward that venerable man&s;ion;&mdash;and never, perhaps, was an evening walk undertaken by two per&s;ons in &s;ituations of mind, and with reflections, more oppo&s;ite. Henry, impelled by de&s;pair, and driven by irremediable nece&s;&s;ity from the pre&s;ence of his dear but deeply di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Caroline, lite|rally felt that "he dragged at each remove,
<PB N="393" REF="403">the lengthening chain:" every &s;tep hurried him farther from the object of his affections, while Olivia, animated by hope, was by every &s;tep brought nearer to him whom &s;he loved with un&s;peakable tenderne&s;s, and whom &s;he fondly believed &s;he was about to make the happie&s;t of mankind.</P>
<P>They met about the mid way of the me|morable grand avenue; and the &s;udden &s;ight of each other in&s;pired very di&s;tinct emo|tions.&mdash;Henry wi&s;hed for the velocity of thought to e&s;cape &s;o un&s;ea&s;onable a rencon|tre, and Olivia &s;ighed for the &s;peed of light to reach his hand.&mdash;Yet both were alike embarra&s;&s;ed, the one by trembling joy, the other by variety of &s;orrow.&mdash;By an invo|luntary impul&s;e, Henry receded a few paces with the degree of rapidity that Olivia ad|vanced; the wings of fear are even more rapid than tho&s;e of love.&mdash;But Henry &s;oon recovered him&s;elf and his &s;teps; and by one of tho&s;e hazards, which have all the air of de&s;ign, and yet are common enough in life, Olivia and Henry joined each other imme|diately parallel to the place where the fir&s;t
<PB N="394" REF="404">avowal of love had been made by Henry to Caroline;&mdash;a circum&s;tance, we tru&s;t, in the full recollection of the reader.</P>
<P>Anxious to know Caroline's reply to the reque&s;t &s;tated in the letter which had already produced &s;o much mi&s;chief in the abbey family, Olivia was covered with blu&s;hes, and, he&s;itating almo&s;t to a &s;tammer, alluded to the &s;ubject mo&s;t likely to increa&s;e Henry's confu&s;ion.&mdash;"What would I give," &s;aid &s;he, "to have been a &s;ylph, or &s;ome other &s;pirit, to have been pre&s;ent, yet un&s;een, at the reading of my hurried but heart-felt letter to Caroline!"</P>
<P>"Pre&s;ent at it!&mdash;you pre&s;ent!&mdash;good heaven!" exclaimed Henry, throwing up his hands and eyes.</P>
<P>"I dare &s;ay," continued Olivia, "you all thought me&mdash;but yet&mdash;I hope&mdash;"</P>
<P>Her blu&s;hes deepened, and the faultering of her voice augmented.</P>
<P>"I hope Caroline did not &s;hew it?&mdash;Gra|cious!&mdash;if &s;he did, I &s;hould never forgive her! yet," recovering her&s;elf, "wherefore &s;hould I talk thus? wherefore attempt to
<PB N="395" REF="405">conceal the pride and triumph of my life? O Henry, my dear&mdash;dear&mdash;Henry, grant me a portion of your eloquence, that I may ex|pre&s;s what I feel at the thought of calling Henry&mdash;I know not what I would &s;ay,&mdash;I only know that I am the mo&s;t honoured and ble&s;&s;ed of human beings,&mdash;and that it is his goodne&s;s, love, and con&s;tancy, have made me &s;o."</P>
<P>Her eyes were directed to tho&s;e of Henry, as her artle&s;s heart thus poured it&s;elf forth to her now almo&s;t hu&s;band; for, in his late ab&s;ence the two fathers had at la&s;t fixed the eventful day of tho&s;e nuptials which had a thou&s;and times come into the &s;port and &s;e|riou&s;ne&s;s of the family conver&s;ation; but Lady Fitzorton had communicated it in form to Olivia a few minutes before &s;he &s;et out to meet Henry.</P>
<P>The eyes of Henry were now ca&s;t a dif|ferent way,&mdash;and they were filled with tears.</P>
<P>"Ah! hope and glory of my life!" ex|claimed Olivia,&mdash;"wherefore do you weep? If, tho&s;e tears, like mine, proceed not from
<PB N="396" REF="406">exce&s;s of tenderne&s;s,&mdash;exce&s;s of felicity,&mdash;the earth b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ars not &s;uch a wretch as Olivia!"</P>
<P>"They do &mdash; the almighty &s;earcher of hearts knows&mdash;they do proceed," &s;aid Hen|ry, pa&s;&s;ionately, "from tenderne&s;s!"</P>
<P>"That omnipotent witne&s;s be prai&s;ed!" ejaculated Olivia. "And yet, methinks I would not have &s;uch drops as the&s;e flow from my Henry's heart, even though they &s;pring from joy!"</P>
<P>Archangels might have &s;anctioned the movement with which Olivia now laid her cheek to that of Henry, and dried up his tears. Alas! the fountain was full, and &s;treamed afre&s;h.</P>
<P>"Yonder is an arboring tree with a bench round it.&mdash;I &s;ee it through the under|wood," &s;aid Olivia, gently drawing Henry towards the place.</P>
<P>"Let us re&s;t awhile," continued &s;he: "for I have &s;omething&mdash;very&mdash;very dear to im|part to my Henry."</P>
<P>Henry &s;uffered him&s;elf to be led pa&s;&s;ively on; when reaching the bench, he &s;at down, Olivia placing her&s;elf by his &s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="397" REF="407">"I prote&s;t," &s;aid Olivia, re&s;uming her cheerfulne&s;s, that Henry might catch the gaiety, "this &s;pot &s;eems formed for tender hearts;&mdash;doth it not, Henry?&mdash;One would imagine the&s;e bowering hawthorns and the&s;e o'er-arching &s;hades, branching from this romantic oak, had been the &s;cene of &s;ome gentle a&s;&s;ignation in days of chivalry."</P>
<P>Every word &s;he &s;poke, though de&s;igned to convey more than the ro&s;e's fragrance to his &s;en&s;e, was &s;harper than a thorn pre&s;&s;ing into his heart. His di&s;appointments were all brought clo&s;e under his very eye: and wherever he turned, memory pre&s;ented &s;ome bleeding image of former felicity, untimely de&s;troyed even in the &s;pot which was at once the place of its birth and burial.</P>
<P>He turned his head, as to conceal his agi|tations, when tho&s;e initials of Caroline's name which his own hand had carved in the rind of the oak, met his view, and the words, "O my only life and love!" bur&s;t &s;pontaneou&s;ly from his heart. The name of Caroline which was about to follow this pa&s;&s;ionate exclamation, quivered and died
<PB N="398" REF="408">on his lips; yet wholly &s;ubdued by a &s;itua|tion &s;o affecting, he &s;unk down on Olivia's &s;houlder; and he had only &s;trength enough to &s;igh out, "This&mdash;this&mdash;is too much!"</P>
<P>Olivia naturally applied to her&s;elf the above-mentioned tender expre&s;&s;ion &s;o cha|racteri&s;tc of Henry's habits, and &s;o conge|nial to the rahp&s;ody of her own heart: and &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed&mdash;as how, indeed, could &s;he imagine otherwi&s;e?&mdash;he was melted by that overwhelming &s;en&s;ibility which might well be excited in a di&s;po&s;ition like his, by the avowal &s;he had made of boundle&s;s returns of her affection. "And, ah! in what lan|guage but your own," cried &s;he, cha&s;tely but fondly care&s;&s;ing him, her own lovely eyes repaying him with large&s;t intere&s;t every tear,&mdash;"oh in what language but Henry's can I an&s;wer &s;uch tenderne&s;s?&mdash;My only life! my only love! Yes," added &s;he, exalting her voice without dimini&s;hing its &s;weetne&s;s, "that divinity to whom my beloved had ju&s;t appealed in te&s;timony of his own faith, can tell how truly my love and life are de|voted to him alone."</P>
<P><PB N="399" REF="409">Henry rai&s;ed him&s;elf up, as if to rectify the mi&s;con&s;truction which had been put on an expre&s;&s;ion that Olivia had &s;o naturally appropriated: but the &s;udden appearance of little Fitz, and, in the en&s;uing moment, the &s;ound of a voice, exclaiming, "there is the dog,&mdash;depend upon it his friends are not far off,"&mdash;pointed his attention to other objects.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="43" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XLIII.</HEAD>
<P>HENRY and Olivia, without expre&s;&s;ing their &s;urpri&s;e to each other, ha&s;ted through the opening in the bu&s;hes to explore the cau&s;e, when they ob&s;erved Sir Armine and Lady Fitzorton coming up the avenue, and within a few paces of them.</P>
<P>Olivia, who had caught up little Fitz, in &s;ilent rapture ran down the avenue to meet them, and in a whi&s;per a&s;&s;ured Lady Fitzor|ton that Henry was the be&s;t creature in the world, and had made her the happie&s;t.&mdash;"With all his ardours you know, my dear madam," &s;aid &s;he, "he is not a man of pro|fe&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="400" REF="410">&mdash;more delicately tru&s;ting to actions than words, in atte&s;tation of his feelings;&mdash;a conduct I have often vainly attempted to imitate, and which I have admired, even when I could have quarrelled with him for it. But, had you heard the endearing ex|pre&s;&s;ions he ju&s;t uttered, accompanied by his tears, and witne&s;&s;ed by his love-declar|ing eyes&mdash;O heaven!&mdash;indeed,&mdash;indeed,&mdash;I am the happie&s;t&mdash;and he is the be&s;t of human beings!"</P>
<P>During the di&s;play of this delu&s;ion, which tho&s;e who admire Olivia will wi&s;h might end with her life, Henry was advancing, but with &s;teps that little ju&s;tified Olivia's de&s;cription, on an occa&s;ion which would have carried him,&mdash;had he been indeed her lover,&mdash;with a &s;peed and impatience like her own.</P>
<P>Indeed he &s;eemed at fir&s;t undetermined whether to make his e&s;cape by ru&s;hing into the woods, or to join the family party. Perceiving, however, the latter were moving towards him, he thought it would be im|po&s;&s;ible to recede; and after a&s;&s;uring his
<PB N="401" REF="411">&s;tars that he now defied their utmo&s;t ma|lice, and &s;hould re&s;ign him&s;elf to their ma|lignant power without any farther re&s;i&s;t|ance, he &s;omewhat quickened his pace, like a man giving him&s;elf up de&s;pairingly to the wor&s;t that could happen. Notwith&s;tanding this, he &s;aluted his parents with tho&s;e graces of filial duty which the &s;ight of them always enkindled, and which even di&s;appointed love, of who&s;e pangs they were in great mea&s;ure the cau&s;e, could not extingui&s;h.</P>
<P>The &s;ight, however, of little Fitz, whom he had not before &s;eemed to notice, had nearly over&s;et his plan of non-re&s;i&s;tance. "Would it not be be&s;t for me, deare&s;t ma|dam, to &s;tep home with that &s;paniel?" &s;aid he to his mother. "I dare &s;ay he watched the opening of the abbey gate to follow me."</P>
<P>Henry held out his arm to receive him from Olivia, who &s;portingly &s;aid, "&s;he was &s;ure he came again on a me&s;&s;age to her from his fair mi&s;tre&s;s; for there was more than ordinary accident in the dog's returning &s;o &s;oon and at &s;uch a moment, they might de|pend
<PB N="402" REF="412">on it; and &s;he would therefore give him a fair chance either to go or &s;tay."</P>
<P>She gently patted him, and &s;et him down, ob&s;erving that &s;he would u&s;e no bribery to detain, nor any chiding to di&s;mi&s;s him. "Let him follow his own unbia&s;&s;ed inclina|tions," &s;aid Olivia: "if he goes towards the abbey, I declare I will not &s;ay a word to call him back; but if he attends any of us uncalled, I &s;hall,&mdash;yes, you may laugh at my &s;uper&s;tition as much as you plea&s;e,&mdash;but I &s;hall think there is more in it than common chance,&mdash;and expect a welcome for him at the ca&s;tle, till I can have an oppor|tunity to return him to his lovely owner, in per&s;on.&mdash;There&mdash;now for it!&mdash;He is now to do as he likes. Say nothing; but let us walk on, and leave him to him&s;elf."</P>
<P>Little Fitz was no &s;ooner &s;et upon the ground, than he paid his compliments, fir&s;t to Henry, then to the re&s;t of the company, and bounding along the avenue in the di|rect line towards the ca&s;tle, &s;eemed to con|firm the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Olivia, who now
<PB N="403" REF="413">roundly re-a&s;&s;erted, nothing &s;hould per&s;uade her there was not more in it than even the philo&s;ophy of John, had he been pre&s;ent, could find out.</P>
<P>Sir Armine, who had attended rather to the hi&s;tory of his &s;on's face than to what had been &s;aid about the dog, caught the eye of Henry, and over-ruled whatever far|ther arguments or objections he might have been di&s;po&s;ed to make: &s;o the whole groupe went together to the ca&s;tle. At fir&s;t they walked arm in arm, in a row; but &s;oon after they divided two and two.&mdash;Oli|via and Lady Fitzorton, Sir Armine and Henry. This arrangement was again al|tered, by de&s;ign or accident: for Sir Ar|mine propo&s;ed that his wife and Olivia &s;hould make the be&s;t of their way home, and that he and Henry would take a poeti|cal &s;aunter, and follow at lei&s;ure; averring that he wi&s;hed to di&s;cu&s;s with him a <HI>knotty</HI> point.</P>
<P>The empha&s;is with which he pronounced the&s;e words, and the &s;mile that accompanied
<PB N="404" REF="414">them, was &s;o well under&s;tood by her lady|&s;hip, that &s;he plea&s;antly exclaimed, walking away with Olivia at the &s;ame time, "Pray, my dear daughter, let us leave the&s;e poetic philo&s;ophers to &s;ettle their <HI>knotty</HI> points by them&s;elves, while you and I," whi&s;pered &s;he to Olivia, who crim&s;oned at the remark, "go and prepare &s;ome other knots that &s;hall prove too hard for both their wor&s;hips." Olivia turned back thrice on pretence of &s;eeing whether little Fitz preferred the male or the female divi&s;ion of the party, but, po&s;&s;ibly, for a more affectionate rea&s;on. The &s;agacious and political little animal, however, &s;eemed to keep, like James Fitz|orton, the midway between them, and &s;o continued to hold well with both parties:&mdash; a line of conduct which has been faithfully followed by much greater politicians.</P>
<P>We would forbear to in&s;ert the&s;e minu|tiae, were we not a&s;&s;ured that the real great events in life are, as &s;ome one has pro|foundly ob&s;erved, produced by a nice train of little circum&s;tances.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="415">For example, this apparenly trifling mat|ter of filing off the family groupe into divi|&s;ions led to an incident of as great impor|tance to Henry, and perhaps to our readers, as any hitherto recorded in this hi&s;tory.</P>
