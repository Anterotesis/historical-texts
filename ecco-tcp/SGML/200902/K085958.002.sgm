<HEAD>BOOK III. THE REVERSES OF HANNAH HEWIT'S FOR|TUNE FROM HER MARRIAGE TO HER BEING SHIPWRECKED IN THE GROSVE|NOR EAST-INDIAMAN.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. HANNAH AND JOHN DASH INTO LIFE, AND SUCCEED RAPIDLY.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the cu&s;tom of writers to terminate a hi&s;tory on the marriage of their Hero and Heroine; forgetting, that as they are then only at the beginning of their cares, the
<PB N="2" REF="4">
work &s;tands a chance, from that period, of becoming more and more diver&s;ified, con|&s;equently more and more intere&s;ting to the reader.</P>
<P>As to what has befallen me, I can &s;afely &s;ay, that &s;ome addition has been made to the mea&s;ure of my care, from the fir&s;t moment I could remember, which was pretty early, to the moment I am now writing; but, I thank God, my mind has &s;trengthened in proportion to every exi|gency, and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having never, intentionally, brought any mi&s;ery on my head, affords me a comfort, in the mid&s;t of all my afflictions, that the guilty happy, if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf, might envy.</P>
<P>Previous to the wedding, we had many con&s;ultations as to the plan of life we &s;hould pur&s;ue. I had &s;aved nearly four hundred pounds from my own earnings, and my brother's pre&s;ents. Hewit ex|pected
<PB N="3" REF="5">
to receive &s;even hundred pounds as his &s;hare of prize money, and my bro|ther would in&s;i&s;t upon giving me five more, as a marriage portion. With this &s;um it was concluded that we could not do better than &s;et up in bu&s;ine&s;s in Lon|don; for though we were but a young couple, Hewit being but twenty-three, and I not quite twenty, they paid me the compliment of &s;aying, that with prudence, like mine, &s;ucce&s;s could not fail to crown our endeavours.</P>
<P>To be &s;ure my brother talked &s;ome|thing of taking Hewit to &s;ea after the honey moon, as he called it, and, I mu&s;t own, he him&s;elf did not &s;eem very aver&s;e to the propo&s;al; but I parried that and every other objection with great &s;ucce&s;s, till finding the Wolverhampton manufac|turers were charmed at the idea of my opening a warehou&s;e in town, and that they, one and all, were ready to give us
<PB N="4" REF="6">
unlimited credit and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, it would have been madne&s;s to have contended again&s;t a plan &s;o very eligible, and &s;o evi|dently advantageous.</P>
<P>John's ma&s;ter was one of the fir&s;t that came into the above &s;cheme, and gene|ron&s;ly gave him up his indentures for the purpo&s;e, remarking, that as far as he knew the bu&s;ine&s;s, he was a very good work|man; and, at any rate, he knew enough to &s;uperintend a &s;hop of his own, adding, that if he was only careful and indu&s;trious, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by ingenuity like mine, we could not fail of making a fortune.</P>
<P>All matters being now properly ar|rainged, it was agreed that we &s;hould fir&s;t go to Bri&s;tol to &s;ettle my brother's affairs, and tho&s;e of Hewit, and then to town; and that no time might be lo&s;t, Mr. Smallbrook undertook that a friend of his &s;hould be in&s;tructed to look out for a hou&s;e and warehou&s;e fit for our purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7">
It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, my heart warmed at the&s;e pro&s;pects; and though I felt great regret at the idea of leaving &s;o many va|luable friends, yet I had ever con&s;idered Wolverhampton as by no means the pro|per &s;phere for an emulative mind like mine to move in. I panted for an op|portunity of di&s;playing my abilities, &s;uch as they were, in the only place where they could be &s;een to advantage. How many patents had the &s;ugge&s;tions of my inge|nuity procured for others; how ju&s;t then that in future the profit &s;hould be my own, and again, a con&s;ideration above all the&s;e, the love of John Hewit would, of cour&s;e, encrea&s;e with my celebrity.</P>
<P>The parting from my friends at Wol|verhampton, was truly intere&s;ting. Par&s;on Williams told John Hewit, that he had the be&s;t wife in the world, and John pro|mi&s;ed to make the be&s;t hu&s;band in the world. I took a tender leave of my two female friends, who promi&s;ed to cor|re&s;pond
<PB N="6" REF="8">
with me, to be kind to Mrs. Crow, and to &s;uperintend my Sunday &s;chool. Mr. Smallbrook, and Mr. Gregory, un|dertook to be our agents at Wolverhamp|ton, and we to be theirs' in London; and now, with hearts full of love and gratitude, accompanied with the good wi&s;hes of our friends, we &s;et out for Bri&s;tol.</P>
<P>My brother and Hewit, in the cour&s;e of a few weeks, received their right. But nothing could induce the former to have any thing more to do with the Bri&s;tol mer|chants. He &s;aid they were &s;harks at &s;ea, crocodiles in &s;hoal water, and tygers on land. So giving them a hearty cur&s;e, it being now in time of peace, he applied to &s;ome friends in London, from whence he &s;oon &s;ailed commander of a fine We&s;t-Indiaman.</P>
<P>On our arrival in town, we found that Mr. Smallbrook's friend had not neglected his commi&s;&s;ion. He took us to &s;ee &s;e|veral
<PB N="7" REF="9">
hou&s;es; and, at la&s;t, we pitched upon one that &s;eemed extremely well to an&s;wer our purpo&s;e. It was &s;ituated in the mo&s;t con&s;picuous part of Cock&s;pur|&s;treet.</P>
<P>I &s;eemed now in the very atmo&s;phere I was born to breathe. I was continually bringing out &s;ome improvement on every article in our way. If a thing u&s;ually went by a weight, I altered it and made it go by a &s;pring; if wheels went well by being vertical, I made them go better by being horizontal; every &s;quare form be|came, by my direction, an oblong; and every circle lengthened into an oval at my bidding. The bu&s;ine&s;s was to make every thing a&s;&s;ume an unu&s;ual form. Con|venience had nothing to do with it. No|velty was the only thing to be thought of. Thus it &s;oon grew as cu&s;tomary to en|quire after the la&s;t new &s;pring candle&s;tick, or reverberating chee&s;e toa&s;ter, at Hewit's,
<PB N="8" REF="10">
as after the la&s;t new comedy, or tragedy, at Drury Lane, or Covent Garden.</P>
<P>Through the medium of our exten&s;ive connections, we were &s;oon &s;urrounded with friends; and by continually keeping invention upon the &s;tretch, we had plenty of means to keep up a large and oppulent acquaintance. Hewit was delighted at this, and as the &s;um of all my wi&s;hes was the happine&s;s of my hu&s;band, I gave into, perhaps, more extravagance than, at fir&s;t, was prudent, without the &s;malle&s;t unea&s;i|ne&s;s, however, for my genius was inex|hau&s;tible, and there was no fear but that the &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h would ever be found to encourage ingenuity.</P>
<P>We had an &s;uperb Villa, kept a coach and a phaeton, both with &s;prings of my own invention, which, of cour&s;e, were in&s;tantly imitated; and having in the country been advi&s;ed to work in the garden, on account
<PB N="9" REF="11">
of a bilious habit, I became, in a &s;hort time, an excellent botani&s;t; &s;o that we abounded in town and country elegance, all the re&s;ult of my fancy.</P>
<P>To crown our felicity, I had now two &s;weet children, the elde&s;t a fine boy, and the younge&s;t a lovely girl.</P>
<P>We had gone on in this &s;tyle for five years, vi&s;iting and been vi&s;ited, fea&s;ting and being fea&s;ted, till there could not be a pitch of fa&s;hion which we did not arrive at; and yet, &s;o confirmed was our &s;ucce&s;s, we could command the means to indulge our&s;elves in much more. But I do not know how it was, I never had a true reli&s;h for any of this plea&s;ure; and I have often been more delighted with contemplating the beauty of a leaf, or a flower, in an in|&s;ulated green-hou&s;e, and hermitage, which I had built in a large piece of water, and in which I took greater plea&s;ure, than in all
<PB N="10" REF="12">
the vain tin&s;el and tawdry trappings of a ball-room.</P>
<P>One rea&s;on, perhaps, was this: I could not find in all the variety of characters that &s;urrounded me, a creature like my|&s;elf. I had a warm heart, and both pro|fe&s;&s;ed and felt cordial friend&s;hip, others were cold, forbidding, and inacce&s;&s;able; and though they profe&s;&s;ed as much as I did, they felt nothing. I envied no wo|man the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a hand&s;ome and accompli&s;hed hu&s;band. Every woman &s;eemed to envy me the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of mine, and every man to envy him the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of me; for under the mark of vivacity and gallantry, all his friends made love to me, and all mine &s;eemed as if they wi&s;hed he &s;hould make love to them.</P>
<P>This life, of all plea&s;ure and no hap|pine&s;s, threw me at times into a very deep melancholy. Not being able to applaud
<PB N="11" REF="13">
my&s;elf for giving into &s;uch folly and ab|&s;urdity, the applau&s;e of the giddy and the vain, operated as a &s;evere &s;atire on my conduct, and many a &s;mile that I forced into my face in public, has been followed by an involuntary tear the moment I was alone.</P>
<P>My greate&s;t plea&s;ure was to take my children to my little i&s;land, and watch my improvements. Ah! how often have I indulged there an irre&s;i&s;table impul&s;e, no doubt a foreboding of my pre&s;ent fate, that confidently a&s;&s;ured me, were that &s;pot &s;eparated from human &s;ociety, &s;o that I could have my hu&s;band, and my children, and merely common nece&s;&s;aries, I &s;hould be much more happy than in &s;uch a de|ceitful world.</P>
<P>This train of ideas made me re&s;olve to prevail on my hu&s;band, who &s;eemed as if he lived but to oblige me, to &s;ave a cer-to
<PB N="12" REF="14">
retire from the bu&s;tle of the world. He came into my propo&s;al, and there ap|peared, ju&s;t then, an admirable opportu|nity of accelerating &s;uch a &s;cheme.</P>
<P>A tin mine was &s;aid to have been di&s;|covered on one &s;ide of Sali&s;bury plain, and the &s;hares in it were expected to yield, at lea&s;t, forty <HI>per cent.</HI> We enquired into the particulars; and finding very &s;olid ground to believe that we &s;hould be perfectly &s;e|cure, we adventured nine thou&s;and pounds in the &s;cheme.</P>
<P>This brought me a good deal about. The expectation of hitting on a way to accompli&s;h my plan of ea&s;e and retire|ment, made me bear the tumult of the world with renewed &s;prightline&s;s and good humour, and the plea&s;ure this gave my hu&s;band, ab&s;orbing every other con&s;idera|tion I joined in the throng, and my me|lancholy, though ever inten&s;e, was never perceived.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP II. HANNAH AND JOHN GO ON IN A GREAT STYLE, AND ARE SURROUNDED BY DEPENDANTS OF ALL DE|SCRIPTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>MY ta&s;te was now con&s;ulted in every thing. The Hewit cap, the Hewit bon|net, and the Hewit robe were all the fa&s;hion; and if I had had vanity enough to credit the a&s;&s;ertions of tho&s;e who partook of our dinners, I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more refined elegance than any woman in town.</P>
<P>There was no end to the train that &s;ur|rounded us. I painted, and every poor arti&s;t in town courted my opinion; I wrote, and all the poor poets dedicated
<PB N="14" REF="16">
their works to me; I under&s;tood a little of mu&s;ic, and my patronage was &s;ought by all the frequenters of the Orange Coffee-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>My &s;onnets, elegies, and eclogues, I knew not how, got into the papers, under the &s;ignature of 'Petrach's Laura.' They were afterwards &s;elected into a pocket vo|lume; and, mo&s;t impartially celebrated as a model for Engli&s;h poetry in the Re|views. Daubings, that would have di&s;|graced a club-room, were fir&s;t exhibited, and afterwards engraved by &s;ub&s;cription, under an idea, that they had the honour and advantage of my &s;anction; and many an ea&s;y &s;et of &s;onatos, which it was impo&s;|&s;ible for any body to play, had a prodi|gious run, from the fortunate circum|&s;tance of my having done them the honour to give them a place on my piano forte; an in&s;trument &s;omething between the vir|ginal and the clarichord, &s;truck by ham|mers; originally made from a &s;ugge&s;tion of
<PB N="15" REF="17">
mine, and which, on that account, had ju&s;t then became the height of the mode, and has obtained wonderfully &s;ince.</P>
<P>I permitted all this non&s;ence, not to gratify my own vanity, for to con&s;ider properly, it was a &s;evere &s;arca&s;m to patro|nize &s;tupidity, but that the poor rogues might eat. Not that every ca&s;e was alike. All my dependants were bad enough off, but not equally &s;o. My painters, through &s;ign-po&s;ts, coach-makers, cheap magazines, or the theatres, could get &s;omething to eat; and a mu&s;ician, with a fiddle under his arm, found no difficulty in &s;craping up a little bread.</P>
<P>But the ca&s;e was different with the poor poet. He mu&s;t &s;hiver in the avenues of Paterno&s;ter-row, and watch, with de|ference and re&s;pect, for the fortunate mo|ment of being called in to earn the li|beral &s;um of half a guinea, by doing a magazine. If he be a retainer to a new&s;|paper,
<PB N="16" REF="18">
he mu&s;t, while he is torne with hunger, de&s;cribe &s;umptuous fea&s;ts; while he roams without a lodging, he mu&s;t ex|patiate upon gorgeous palaces; and he mu&s;t minutely particularize every beauty of court dre&s;&s;es, on a birth day, while he is trembling without a coat to his back.</P>
<P>Though I heartily lamented the occa&s;ion, I cannot help &s;aying, that it gave me &s;ome &s;atisfaction to be able, by a knowledge of the&s;e circum&s;tances, to account for the &s;candalous and &s;hameful rancour with which the&s;e poor devils be&s;patter one an|other. Literature, by expanding the mind, is &s;urely calculated to convey noble and generous &s;entiments; and, in proportion as the human intellects are enlarged and improved, &s;o one would think they would become fraught with the divinely &s;ocial quality of beneficence; but as we are taught to con&s;ider &s;elf pre&s;ervation as pa|ramount to all other motives, &s;o it mu&s;t be that con&s;ideration, and that only, in
<PB N="17" REF="19">
men of enlightened manners and in|formed minds, which can po&s;&s;ibly account for their barking and &s;narling, and &s;natch|ing the fluctuating mor&s;el from each others' mouth, like &s;o many half fami&s;hed curs.</P>
<P>This al&s;o I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e has an ef|fect on their tempers, and thus their tem|pers are reflected in their writings. One addre&s;&s;es your feelings in his works in the language of an incendiary, as if he thought you could be bullied into compa&s;&s;ion, and reviles the age and every one in it, imply|ing that there is no virtuous man but him|&s;elf, the prominent feature of who&s;e vir|tue he convinces you, by his manner, is vain a&s;&s;umption, and impertinent arro|gance.</P>
<P>Another, no le&s;s hurt, throws into his &s;tyle all the oily, &s;moothne&s;s of ful&s;ome adulation; and with the &s;ame ductile plia|bility, prai&s;es every body, and every thing;
<PB N="18" REF="20">
but his commendation is an affront, and his flattery a nau&s;ea, for no man can be all virtue any more than he can be all vice; and, indeed, even if he &s;poke his &s;enti|ments, he is the la&s;t man in the world to judge of what he writes; for while his pen emits milk, his heart overflows with gall; and while he effects the language of can|dour, he is torne with the gnawings of envy.</P>
<P>As to the lady writers, who&s;e merito|rious exertions I had &s;o much admired in the country, they none of them came in my way, being well patronized before; and if they had, there were many rea&s;ons why I mu&s;t have declined a&s;&s;i&s;ting them, all which are very probably obvious to the reader; I &s;hall, therefore, only &s;ay, that now my judgment had grown more mature, I con&s;iderably altered my opinion, and wondered how the age could, with any degree of patience, except in &s;uch in&s;tances, as my name&s;ake Hannah More,
<PB N="19" REF="21">
Mi&s;s Seward, my dear Mi&s;s Margery Wil|liams, and a few others, receive le&s;&s;ons of virtue and morality from women, the notoriety of who&s;e practices gave the broad lie to their precepts.</P>
<P>Being, I own, a little wickedly inclined to impo&s;e upon that world which I &s;aw &s;o willing to impo&s;e upon it&s;elf, I, now and then, helped my poor dependants out, by &s;ub&s;tituting a portion of my ingenuity to make up their deficiency in merit. If an author had failed by a poem, I made him &s;ucceed by a puzzle; if a mu&s;ician lo&s;t money by compo&s;ing what was ea&s;y, I brought him up by &s;hewing him how to compo&s;e what was impracticable; if a painter could not &s;ucceed by imitating nature, I made him &s;trike into caracature. Every body recollects the cylindrical prints; they were entirely of my in|vention.</P>
<P>But the thing in which I be&s;t &s;uc|eeded,
<PB N="20" REF="22">
was an invention of mine to &s;erve Walme&s;ley; who having made one voyage with my brother to the We&s;t Indies, de|termined, on his return, to live peaceably upon Terra Firma. We all contributed towards e&s;tabli&s;hing him; and it was re|&s;olved he &s;hould open a warehou&s;e for the &s;ale of patent medicines, which, as the rea|der knows, he was well qualified to coun|terfeit.</P>
<P>Celebrity, however, is only to be at|tained by novelty. I, therefore, invented a new medicine, which was to cure, or rather to prevent, every po&s;&s;ible &s;pecies of di&s;order to which the human frame is lia|ble. The doctrine upon which this a&s;|&s;ertion hinged was this: All di&s;orders proceed from the blood; and could that fluid be kept pure and uncontaminated, it mu&s;t be clear to every capacity, that there would immediately be an end of gouts, fevers, and all the long catalogue of complaints inumerated in the bills of mortality.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="23">
The virtue of eradicating every &s;pe|cies of impurity from the circulation we were to prove that our no&s;trum clearly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; which I went about to do, in the hand bill I drew up for Walme&s;ley, in the following manner:</P>
<P>I called this &s;overeign remedy, 'The Univer&s;al Specific; or, E&s;&s;ence of May Dew, impregnated with Spirit of Owl's Dung.' I then held this argument. The blood is, certainly, in its pure&s;t &s;tate when both the body and mind are in their &s;tronge&s;t vigour. Now the month of May is the mo&s;t vigorous and healthy month in the year, and the owl is the bird of wi&s;dom, ina&s;much as Minerva her&s;elf, has the image of that bird for her cre&s;t.</P>
<P>May dew has &s;en&s;ibly been called the E&s;&s;ence of Vegetation, and it is be|lieved, by more than one writer on agri|culture, to contain particles imbued with nutrimental qualities, which, perforating
<PB N="22" REF="24">
the pores of the leaf on which the dew falls, penetrate the &s;ap, and con&s;equently contribute to the health of the plant.</P>
<P>Thus I fairly e&s;tabli&s;hed my po&s;ition, as far as it related to animal exi&s;tence by means of fermentation, a quality, I ar|gued, as certainly e&s;&s;ential as putre&s;action; for man is an entity, part animal, part ve|getable, hair and nails being brought to perfection as mechanically as cucumbers; for, like them, they are improved by prun|ing, and, like them, grow be&s;t, hair e&s;pe|cially, in a hot &s;oil.</P>
<P>To make good the remainder of my argument, I rea&s;oned thus: As animal exi&s;tence is allowed, in great mea&s;ure, to depend on putrefaction, as the owl is the bird of all others endowed with mo&s;t wi&s;|dom, and as wi&s;dom is the mind's health; the owl's dung, being the putrefacton of wi&s;dom, the &s;pirit extracted from it mu&s;t naturally, materially brace and &s;trengthen
<PB N="23" REF="25">
the mind, and, con&s;equently, a&s;&s;i&s;t in pro|moting the vigour of the body.</P>
<P>By the time this medicine had been &s;een on my toilette, and on the toilettes of &s;ome ladies of my acquaintance, it took beyond credibility; and Walme&s;ley, per|fectly in his element, was enabled to lavi&s;h what he received from the follies of the rich, to relieve the mi&s;eries of the poor.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. FORTUNE GROWS FICKLE, FRIENDS BEGIN TO BE COOL, HANNAH WAKES FROM HER DREAM OF PROSPERITY, JOHN IS AFRAID OF THE BAILIFFS, AND CAPTAIN HIGGINS GETS INTO A PRISON.</HEAD>
<P>BEING now on the very pinnacle of our hopes, having for more than eight years experienced a &s;eries of plea&s;ure and profit &s;carcely credible, we were fated to expe|rience a mo&s;t dreadful rever&s;e. The tin mines turned out a bubble. After &s;o much money and labour had been la|vi&s;hed away, and di&s;appointment, that had perpetually &s;ucceeded to expectation, &s;eemed perpetually to be revived with new hopes, like the projection of a che|mi&s;t on the eve of finding the philo&s;opher's &s;tone, every thing was flown <HI>in fumo.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="27">
No tin was to be found, and now all the world, who had encouraged our hopes, and a&s;&s;ured us we could not fail of making a fortune, for the fir&s;t time, di&s;covered that nothing could be &s;o mad and ab&s;urd as to &s;earch for tin upon Sali&s;bury Plain.</P>
<P>It was now ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary im|mediately to retrench; and, in retrenching, it was nece&s;&s;ary to give up our fa&s;hionable friends. Poor Hewit thought otherwi&s;e, and, Timon like, indulged con&s;iderable expecta|tion from the friend&s;hip of tho&s;e to whom we, indeed, had &s;hewn friend&s;hip; but he &s;oon found him&s;elf egregiou&s;ly deceived. There was not a &s;ingle creature in all the buzzing croud, that had fluttered round us, but flew off and left us as if we had been a contagion.</P>
<P>The cry was&mdash;How could &s;uch up&s;tarts pre&s;ume to vie with people of fa&s;hion? They had better have &s;tuck to their bu&s;i|ne&s;s;

but this was always the ca&s;e; 'twas not the fir&s;t in&s;tance of low people being ruined by aping their &s;uperiors. It was plain to &s;ee that every thing had been a long time going to rack and ruin. They did not make half &s;uch good &s;nuffers as they u&s;ed to do. In &s;hort, the &s;quibs and &s;arca&s;ms, that flew about, were innumera|ble; and, though but a month before, had we been actually guilty of any crime, we could have found friends to have proved us immaculate, had we now been accu&s;ed, though perfectly innocent, it would have gone hard with us; nor did we e&s;cape my very arti&s;ts, I was lampooned in a &s;ong, called Pride out of tune, by a mu&s;ician for whom I got a large &s;ub&s;cription; a painter I had taught to caracature others, caraca|tured me; and my milky poet, who had nau&s;eated me with adulation, now levelled a volley of &s;curility again&s;t me in a poem, under the title of, 'Sappho in the Tin Mines.'</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="29">
For my own part, had it not been for the lo&s;s of fortune, I &s;hould have rejoiced at all this, for I had long wi&s;hed to give Hewit a di&s;ta&s;te to the world, and this fairly completed my purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>One thing in particular took effect ex|actly as I had wi&s;hed; my hu&s;band and I, as before mentioned, had a di&s;pute when fir&s;t we our&s;elves received the news of our lo&s;s, and while it continued unknown to our acquaintance. He, being of opinion that we &s;hould keep their countenance and good wi&s;hes, and I, that we &s;hould be ut|terly for&s;aken. I offered to put it at i&s;&s;ue, in a way that plea&s;ed him very much.</P>
<P>Having a good deal led the fa&s;hions, my ta&s;te, as I before ob&s;erved, was looked up to as a pattern of elegance; but, parti|cularly, as to the &s;hape. I altered the wai&s;t at any time in a month; and, at the period
<PB N="28" REF="30">
I am &s;peaking of, I had brought it to &s;uch a length, that when a lady &s;at down the peak of her &s;tays touched the chair. My propo&s;al was, all of a &s;udden, to &s;horten the wai&s;t to nothing, to tye a &s;a&s;h immediately under the arms, and let all below re&s;emble a promi&s;cuous ma&s;s of loo&s;e drapery, under an idea that the fa&s;hion was Grecian.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time I propo&s;ed, that Hewit &s;hould have a great coat made without &s;kirts, and his excu&s;e &s;hould be that &s;kirts were an inconvenient thing in the rain, and that the upper part would an|&s;wer all the purpo&s;e of warmth for which great coats were worne. We both agreed that the fa&s;hion would be followed; the di&s;pute was, whether or not they would continue it when they knew our rever&s;e of fortune.</P>
<P>He agreed to abide the trial; and, on the following Sunday, we drove round the
<PB N="29" REF="31">
Ring in Hyde Park, dre&s;&s;ed in our new Hewits; which were, fir&s;t, the &s;urprize, and afterwards the admiration of every body. The papers were full of the new Hewits. On the following Sunday many people wore them; on the Sunday after, every body wore them; and on the Sun|day after that, our ill fortune getting &s;cent in the interval, every body left them off.</P>
<P>Upon a fair review of our &s;ituation there appeared nothing de&s;perate in it; for though Mr. Smallbrook was dead, and Mr. Gregory had retired from bu&s;ine&s;s, which, by the way, cut off all communi|cation between me and Mi&s;s Binns, who had been gone &s;ome time under the care of a friend to the Ea&s;t Indies, yet our Wolverhampton and Pontepool connec|tions were as exten&s;ive as ever; and though it did not appear that we could perfect our plan of retirement as &s;oon as could be expected, yet there did not &s;eem
<PB N="30" REF="32">
to be much danger, with care, of our liv|ing in a very comfortable &s;tyle.</P>
<P>But now came a &s;evere &s;troke indeed. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the tin mines had been as complete a deception as the famous South Sea bubble. Several individuals con|cerned were declared bankrupts, and it &s;oon became evident that no real money had been employed in it but ours. We began now to tremble for the con&s;e|quences; for as the whole was completely a partner&s;hip, we feared that the &s;olvent parties might be &s;ued for deficiencies. The&s;e fears were &s;oon realized; and in the cour&s;e of a few months, demands were exhibited again&s;t us to the amount of al|mo&s;t twelve thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>Ruin now &s;tared us in the face. To appea&s;e the rapacity of the mo&s;t importu|nate, fir&s;t went the lea&s;e of the hou&s;e in the country, with all my improvements&mdash;The carriages had been put down before&mdash;Next

jewels, then plate, in &s;hort, we &s;tript our|&s;elves and yet were as much pe&s;tered as ever; nor did misfortune threaten us alone: my elder brother, who had made &s;everal very &s;ucce&s;sful voyages to the We&s;t-Indies, had been prevailed on by the very &s;ame &s;et to trade, according to his own fancy, upon a two years voyage. The plan was his own, and it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed it was a good idea.</P>
<P>He was to purcha&s;e commodities at any place he thought proper, where they were cheap, and to fell them in countries where they were dear. They fitted him out with money to their la&s;t guinea, and all their expectation of a &s;upply was from what he might have to remit them. He, always ju&s;t, remitted to the very &s;hilling, drawing upon them for repairs, victualing, and others incurred expences, according to the nature of the exigency. It &s;o hap|pened, that having been at &s;everal markets up the Streights, and in different parts of
<PB N="32" REF="34">
the Mediterranian, he had in his hands, of theirs, upwards of three thou&s;and pounds, which he informed them of; and al&s;o that he meant to bring it home, the term of his voyage being nearly expired.</P>
<P>Having put into Leghorn, he was a&s;to|ni&s;hed at being applied to for a bill of four hundred pounds, which his owners had re|fu&s;ed to accept, and which had, therefore, been prote&s;ted in form. He paid it of cour&s;e with their money, but could not help thinking there was &s;omething extra|ordinary in the tran&s;action. He, however, thought it could be &s;ome how or other explained, and touched at another part, where a demand, in the &s;ame way, was exhibited again&s;t him of &s;even hundred pounds. In &s;hort, before he reached the Thames, he had paid upwards of two thou|&s;and pounds of his owners' money in this manner.</P>
<P>Having fairly now di&s;covered what
<PB N="33" REF="35">
men he had to deal with, he determined, the moment he &s;et his foot a&s;hore, to con|&s;ult &s;ome attorney as to what &s;teps he could take again&s;t them, for his name was out upon all their engagements.</P>
<P>The attorney informed him, with very little ceremony, that there was a &s;tatute of bankruptcy out again&s;t his owners, that among the accounts they had given in was one charging him with the value of the &s;hip and her different cargoes, all correctly &s;pecified in letters and memorandums re|ceived from him&s;elf; and, al&s;o, three thou|&s;and pounds and upwards, which money he had acquainted them remained in his hands before he touched at Leghorn. That as the&s;e were large &s;ums, and the a&s;&s;ignees were very anxious to receive all monies due to the creditors at large, he had &s;ued out a proce&s;s again&s;t him, to be ready on his arrival, and he might now have his choice of going either to a Spunging-hou&s;e,
<PB N="34" REF="36">
or at once to Newgate, as he might think proper.</P>
<P>Thus did I welcome my brother home by vi&s;iting him in Newgate, from whence, however, he was &s;oon removed to the Fleet, where we had &s;carcely &s;een him &s;afe, but we had rea&s;on enough to believe we &s;hould &s;oon join him. In the mean time, as we paid enormous &s;ums, through the villainy of the &s;ame oppre&s;&s;ors, we were told that we might have our remedy again&s;t them, among whom, to my con|fu&s;ion, as it came out, upon an inve&s;tiga|tion, were collaterally concerned the vil|lain Sourby, and my unnatural brother the lawyer.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP IV. HANNAH AND JOHN, TO AVOID THE MALICE OF THE WORLD, ASSUME THE GARB OF HUMILITY.</HEAD>
<P>THE-further we looked into our affairs, the more we were confirmed in the cer|tainty that our ruin and my brother's had been long, regularly, and &s;y&s;tematically determined upon. From the moment our good genius took us by the hand and led us on towards pro&s;perity and independence, tho&s;e fiends, Sourby, and my brother the lawyer, were contriving, in &s;ecret, &s;ome diabolical &s;cheme to fatten them&s;elves at the expence of our indu&s;try.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="38">
I own I had, at times, feared &s;omething of this; for my brother, the lawyer, had, &s;oon after we &s;ettled in town, made &s;everal attempts at a reconciliation, which I never would &s;ubmit to; and Sourby had thrown him&s;elf purpo&s;ely in the way of Hewit at public places, and once, at a coffee-hou&s;e, he managed to be of a party at a card ta|ble, where John was pre&s;ently cheated out of fifty pounds. Indeed, one evening he had the audacity to addre&s;s me in a very particular manner at the rout of a per&s;on of di&s;tinction; and when I repul&s;ed his impertinence in the manner it de&s;erved, he told me, in a very pointed manner, that high as I carried my head at pre&s;ent, I might one day, perhaps, be obliged to humble to him.</P>
<P>It was plain now that we had not a &s;ingle moment to lo&s;e. The fir&s;t &s;tep was to keep Hewit out of the way, that he might not &s;hare the fate of my brother.
<PB N="37" REF="39">
For this purpo&s;e we hid him at Wal|me&s;ley's, where, while I &s;et my face to the weather at home, he drew out a faithful account of our affairs, in order to &s;ee what it would be in our power to do to keep our heads above water.</P>
<P>This, however, appeared to be imprac|ticable, for our property had been &s;o im|paired by the late various and heavy de|mands, that we had, of what we could call our own, but little more than would cover the ju&s;t due of tho&s;e trade&s;men and manu|facturers, who&s;e debts, indeed, the only le|gal debts we owed, we were determined honourably and con&s;cientiou&s;ly to di&s;|charge.</P>
<P>In our coun&s;els, therefore, which we held at my brother's apartment in the Fleet every Sunday, where, by the way, his unconquerable fortitude, and &s;weetne&s;s of temper, had endeared him to every body, it was thought expedient for Hewit
<PB N="38" REF="40">
to execute a deed of tru&s;t in favour of my brother, that the property might be imme|diately appropriated by him to the pay|ment of our legal debts.</P>
<P>This was done, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was then given, and our tormentors had no remedy as to property. Circular letters were next written to tho&s;e creditors we meant to pay, who, as the reader will learn, were honourably paid twenty &s;hillings in the pound.</P>
<P>The villains who had ruined us, were now, of cour&s;e, &s;o exa&s;perated, that it be|came more nece&s;&s;ary than ever to conceal the per&s;on of Hewit. This could not be done at Walme&s;ley's, and to place him any where el&s;e, might be attended with aggra|vated danger, be&s;ides being expen&s;ive and inconvenient. What to do? We once had an idea of &s;urrendering him to the Fleet, but then it occurred to us, that it might be an impri&s;onment for life, e&s;pecially at
<PB N="39" REF="41">
the in&s;tance of &s;uch implacable enemies; and, again, why anticipate a fate which it would be time enough to &s;ubmit to when it &s;hould be unavoidable.</P>
<P>A variety of expedients &s;ugge&s;ted them|&s;elves. At la&s;t I hit on one which, at any rate, would give us breathing time, and which, I thought, I could fa&s;hion &s;o to Hewit's ta&s;te, as to divert his mind, now completely depre&s;&s;ed; I, therefore, thus explained my &s;cheme to him.</P>
<P>"It is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, my dear Hewit, to exi&s;t by our indu&s;try, or &s;tarve. We have two &s;weet children, and we mu&s;t find bread for them. 'Tis true I can earn money, but it will be impo&s;&s;ible to be &s;afe where we are known. I have, therefore, a plan to propo&s;e to you, which, at fir&s;t, will look a little romantic, but which, I think, upon reflection, you will approve. I have thought of it with plea&s;ure upon many accounts. In the fir&s;t place, it will take a
<PB N="40" REF="42">
load off your mind; in the next place, it will give you an opportunity of laughing at that world which is now laughing at you; again, it will procure me the coveteous happine&s;s of having you entirely to my|&s;elf; and, la&s;tly, it will &s;trengthen, if po&s;&s;i|ble, your affection for me, by &s;hewing you that I am ready to embrace any fortune, though ever &s;o humble, out of affection to you.</P>
<P>"In &s;hort, my love," &s;aid I, "this is what I propo&s;e. That you &s;hould vi&s;it tho&s;e parts of the kingdom where we are unknown, as a Razor-grinder, attended by your wife and children. Our grandeur &s;hall be changed to humility; the hand of nece&s;&s;ity &s;hall form our coach into a machine for whetting knives and &s;ci&s;|&s;ars; our phaeton &s;hall be converted into panniers, and our &s;tud into an a&s;s, as a memento of that folly which taught us to lavi&s;h our fortune on an ungrateful world.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="43">
"Well," continued I, "how do you reli&s;h my &s;cheme? Is it not, at lea&s;t, as &s;ea&s;ible as Walme&s;ley's turning bear? I think it is; and, if I mi&s;take not, I'll make it as amu&s;ing. For one thing, &s;uffer what we may, you &s;hall never &s;ee me without a &s;mile; indeed, pro&s;perity has often &s;orced from my eyes tho&s;e tears to which the children of humility are &s;trangers. The chearfulne&s;s of indu&s;try &s;mooths the path of poverty; it looks forward with hope, pro&s;perity &s;hrinks backward with fear; and men rai&s;e tho&s;e edifices, brick by brick, that, when they fall, fall all at once."</P>
<P>'By heaven!' &s;aid John, 'you are an angel, Hannah, and I'll follow you to the world's end. I will laugh at the world, indeed, oppre&s;s me as it may. I have a right to laugh at it, for I have tricked it of you, a prize of more value than all that's left!' I was delighted at his kindne&s;s and his willingne&s;s to embrace my offer, and it
<PB N="42" REF="44">
was agreed to put our &s;cheme in execu|tion immediately. Not to detain the rea|der, Walme&s;ley bought a razor-grinder's travelling apparatus, an a&s;s, and a pair of panniers; I gathered together &s;ome ne|ce&s;&s;aries, and &s;uch materials as I knew I could turn to account; I concerted with my brother how we &s;hould corre&s;pond with each other; and when every nece&s;|&s;ary preliminary was &s;ettled, we &s;allied forth on the 9th of September, 1772, a child in each pannier, John crying, 'Ra|zors to Grind,' and I decked with a &s;tring of pincu&s;hions and trinkets, for &s;ale on the way.</P>
<P>Till we got at a di&s;tance from town, we were rather unea&s;y; and our apprehen|&s;ion was not a little increa&s;ed by the very particular notice every body took of us; which, upon reflection, only aro&s;e from our exhibiting a perfect picture of indu&s;try, for I was dre&s;&s;ed &s;o tidy, John looked &s;o clean, and our children &s;o whole&s;ome, that
<PB N="43" REF="45">
people gave us more work, out of curio|&s;ity, than would have fallen to our &s;hare had there been nothing particular in our appearance; and, at any rate, more than we wi&s;hed for, on account of the &s;mall di&s;tance we had yet got from London.</P>
<P>The reflection was now verified that I had a thou&s;and times made. If people are ever &s;o poor they may be comfortable to them&s;elves, and command the attention of the world, particularly women. In&s;tead of lounging, with a child over the arm in a crampt attitude, li&s;tening to the &s;candal of every wa&s;herwoman in the pari&s;h, her face all grimed, her cloaths all filth, the wife of a labourer, be&s;tired her&s;elf to prepare a cleanly repa&s;t for her returning hu&s;band, and wa&s;hed her face that he might &s;ee tho&s;e &s;miles with which he has a right to be re|ceived; I will venture to &s;ay cottages might be the &s;eat of content and comfort; and hone&s;t, hard working men, would &s;o|lace
<PB N="44" REF="46">
them&s;elves with real plea&s;ures at home, in&s;tead of being driven by &s;latern|lyne&s;s, and ill temper, to &s;eek for artificial plea&s;ures in an ale-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This was exemplified at lea&s;t in me. I had propo&s;ed to Hewit that when we found a good place for our purpo&s;e, we &s;hould &s;ettle there for a given time in &s;ome comfortable, cleanly cottage; by which means we &s;hould be enabled to avoid all the vulgar croud that would otherwi&s;e very much annoy us if we took up our re&s;idence among the common herd at ale-hou&s;es.</P>
<P>I had another rea&s;on al&s;o for this. As our conver&s;ation and conduct, in every re&s;pect, were a good deal above the level of per&s;ons in our &s;ituation, I wi&s;hed to prevent as much as po&s;&s;ible all prying into our affairs; for as I knew, by experience, that people in the country &s;eldom give a kind motive to what they cannot compre|hend,
<PB N="45" REF="47">
I did not know but one of tho&s;e &s;ingular chances which &s;eemed particu|larly to characterize our fortune, might drag us from our concealment, and &s;end us to join my brother.</P>
<P>In &s;pight of all my caution, how|ever, in the cour&s;e of our itinerant expe|dition, there exi&s;ts &s;carcely a motive that could po&s;&s;ibly apply to our conduct, but was by &s;ome per&s;on or other attributed to it. The exci&s;eman at Colche&s;ter, &s;aid he &s;hould not wonder if we were &s;mugglers, and declared, one evening at an ale-hou&s;e, which intelligence we received from a very kind friend, who gave the caution in order to put us upon our guard, that if the lawyer was of opinion he could &s;tand to it, he would undertake to &s;earch us.</P>
<P>He added, that Flanders lace was a thing very ea&s;y of conveyance; and &s;aid that he had &s;u&s;pected that there was &s;ome|thing going forward by my being &s;ent for
<PB N="46" REF="48">
by &s;o many ladies in the neighbourhood, who had, indeed, bought trinkets of me, and concluded by &s;aying, that there was no chance of a reform in &s;muggling, while the heads of the nation connived at it.</P>
<P>At Harwich, an old drum-major was almo&s;t confident we were &s;pies. He had noticed my taking a &s;ketch of the harbour, the light-hou&s;e, and other objects near the &s;ea; and was almo&s;t &s;ure he had heard me &s;ay &s;omething one day that &s;ounded very like the French lingo.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t curious, and, indeed, the mo&s;t &s;erious thing that happened, was in a large manufacturing town in York&s;hire; where we were &s;u&s;pected of being per&s;ons employed by government to mix among the lower cla&s;&s;es of the people to detect &s;edition.</P>
<P>It is certain&mdash;the people there being principally di&s;&s;enters, and full of fanati|ci&s;m,
<PB N="47" REF="49">
indeed almo&s;t the only laborious body in the kingdom, where the mild doc|trines of Mr. We&s;tley, who always recom|mended a &s;pirit of loyalty, and a love of order, had not prevailed&mdash;moody di&s;con|tent and turbulent di&s;quiet &s;eemed to mark this dingy race. Their faces, their &s;hirts, and their minds, &s;eemed to be equally grimed; and in&s;tead of gratitude to provi|dence for placing them in a land the be&s;t calculated upon earth to protect their fa|milies, and &s;ecure their property, the&s;e demons, in their fuliginous pandemonium, were perpetually &s;eeking to overturn that order their gloomy &s;ouls had no reli&s;h for.</P>
<P>Hewit and I, who were both from in|clination and duty, firmly loyal, u&s;ed to combat the non&s;en&s;e and wickedne&s;s of the&s;e people; who&s;e &s;anguinary &s;cheme, though yet in embryo, it was plain to &s;ee, if not in&s;tantly checked, would, one day, expand to the ruin of all order, and good-fellow&s;hip. They in&s;tantly became &s;hy

of us, and my landlord, having one day picked up a letter from Walme&s;ley, which being interlarded with quotations from plays, &s;eemed to favour his &s;u&s;picions, I remember one of them was, "The re&s;ty knaves are over-run with ea&s;e, as plenty ever is the nur&s;e of faction," we received a civil intimation that it would be as &s;afe for us to retire to &s;ome other place; a hint we did not fail in&s;tantly to profit our&s;elves of.</P>

<P>But I &s;aw nothing in their clamour again&s;t me that they did not rai&s;e again&s;t

Another had a great uncle who was a blue coat boy, and he was bribed at the drawing of the lottery to &s;ecrete the ten thou&s;and pound prize, for which piece of roguery he was rewarded with half the amount; and be|ing, afterwards, hone&s;t and indu&s;trious, he had &s;o thriven in the world, that though he never got rid of the nick name of Tom of Ten Thou&s;and, the family were now worth oceans.</P>
<P>A certain baronet had ri&s;en in the world by a little fal&s;e &s;tep which his grand|mother made with a Prince, who was lo&s;t in a fore&s;t a hunting. Another gentleman, a great lawyer, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a very large e&s;tate

in con&s;equence of a di&s;tant relation's hav|ing contrived to hang an innocent man; but the money never pro&s;pered with any of them, for the gho&s;t of the man haunted all the family till they dropt off one by one, and now this only remaining heir was going after the re&s;t, for he was reported to have a wolf in his arm, which made now and then a horrible howling, but the fact was, the noi&s;e was occa&s;ioned by the gnaw|ings of his con&s;cience.</P>
<P>The&s;e and many other &s;tories, was I compelled to hear, and, indeed, compelled to wonder at, otherwi&s;e I &s;hould have made my own ca&s;e more enigmatical than it ap|peared before. My a&s;toni&s;hment was, that had what I heard been correctly fact, the foundation of all the wealth in the kingdom mu&s;t have been a large ma&s;s com|po&s;ed of every mon&s;trous and dete&s;table crime, that could humiliate and di&s;grace human nature.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="57">
For my own part I could have wi&s;hed, had &s;uch a thing been po&s;&s;ible, to have heard of fortunes which had &s;prung from honourable de&s;ert, true patrioti&s;m, or lau|dable indu&s;try; but I could never coax out any acknowledgment of this kind; and even when I alledged, that oppulent men had founded charities, and built ho&s;pitals, 'It was very true; but men could not take their money with them, and it was policy to leave &s;trangers to &s;peak well of them after death, that their cla|mour might drown the voices of tho&s;e who knew them.'</P>
<P>For nearly three years did we follow this itinerant life, which, though it was at|tended with many unplea&s;ant circum|&s;tances, had its moments of &s;atisfaction. Hewit entered &s;o much into the &s;pirit of regarding the &s;cenes we witne&s;&s;ed, as if looking at a comedy; that though I &s;aw a little further, and, in the end, felt com|mi&s;eration

for that which, at fir&s;t, I had laughed at, I never checked his good hu|mour, but rather encouraged him to di|vert him&s;elf at the ridiculous &s;ide of the picture, than pity the envious rever&s;e of it.</P>
<P>During this time I had frequently heard from my brother, who had honour|ably, &s;o far, &s;ettled our affairs, that all tho&s;e with whom we had any bu&s;ine&s;s, de|clared they were hand&s;omely &s;atisfied, and perfectly di&s;po&s;ed, whenever we thought proper to demand it, to give us credit again. Poor &s;oul he had gone on but in|differently him&s;elf, for he was too proud to &s;ue to tho&s;e he had formerly a&s;&s;i&s;ted, which neglect they took comfortably to them&s;elves as a &s;ufficient excu&s;e why they &s;hould not a&s;&s;i&s;t him.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR HANNAH,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have been weather bound in this &s;ame Fleet now twelve months, and &s;ee no more pro&s;pect of making land than the fir&s;t moment I &s;et my foot aboard; how|ever, when the wind won't favour us, we mu&s;t manoeuvre. The wor&s;t of it is, I have been upon &s;uch cur&s;ed &s;hort allow|ance. It would make you laugh if you knew how I managed.</P>
<P>I fir&s;t &s;et up a Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi Table; but you don't know what that is; it is a plain upon which you trundle an ivory ball with a view to reach a certain mark; but that's no ea&s;y matter. There are barriers &s;et to impede its progre&s;s, ju&s;t as there are to prevent an hone&s;t man from going through the world; if he can mi&s;s them, well and good, if not, the game is up. I was a fool for my pains in this bu&s;ine&s;s. The rogues took their winnings and paid their lo&s;ings, but always ticked for the
<PB N="58" REF="60">
table; be&s;ides, it was ju&s;t then determined that no tables of chance &s;hould be kept but for the purpo&s;e of ruining heirs, en|couraging of bankers' clerks to cheat their ma&s;ters, and trade&s;men to ruin their fami|lies; &s;o, as I had no &s;uch virtuous inten|tions, by the time I had about nine and thirty two halfpenny cu&s;tomers in my debt, the commander of the Fleet gave the &s;ig|nal to break up my table.</P>
<P>After this I turned cobler&mdash;What do you laugh at you jade! Why &s;hould not I turn cobler as well as Jack Hewit turn razor-grinder? My father always told me, if I was to be a cobler, I &s;hould be the be&s;t in the &s;treet. I did as little at that, however, as the other. How could I expect to mend people's &s;hoes who had none to their feet.</P>
<P>I did not know what to do next; I had &s;ome thoughts of going partners with Wal|me&s;ley, and &s;etting up a bit of a quack
<PB N="59" REF="61">
&s;hop, but this was wor&s;e cobbling than the other, for all the money here goes to buy kitchen phy&s;ic.</P>
<P>I made after this rackets and balls for the Fives-court, to as little purpo&s;e as the re&s;t; for, as in the ca&s;e of the Mi&s;&s;i|&s;ippi table, I found that &s;habby game&s;ters are as aver&s;e to paying any thing but their debts of honour, as genteel ones; but, however, though I got but little pro|fit, my occupation &s;upplied me with plenty of amu&s;ement, for as marker ge|neral, I had a curious number of di&s;putes to arbitrate.</P>
<P>It was not above a week ago that a butcher in Fleet-market, being accu&s;ed by a baronet of cheating, declared, upon his honour, as a gentleman, that his honour, the baronet, was a &s;habby ill begotten, no nation rip; and that if he twigged him any of his rum gammon, he'd box his ho|nour
<PB N="60" REF="62">
for a bellyful. I knew the baronet to be a man of an excellent heart, of &s;trict honour, and of fini&s;hed manners; and, therefore, that he &s;tood no chance with &s;uch a fellow. So I took him off his hands; and hinting to him what I knew would draw on me a volley of abu&s;e, I took that for an excu&s;e for giving him a bellyful, and &s;uch a one as, I fancy, pre|vented his eating for a week. But &s;ays you, how came this baronet gaming with a butcher? Alas, my dear girl, mi&s;ery brings us acquainted with &s;trange com|panions. Pride is a bad ingredient for a pri&s;on; and if I have &s;at down, at a gaming hou&s;e, near the court, which I have, with a taylor, a lord, an amba&s;&s;ador, and a marker at a tennis-court, what wonder, in jail, if the tables are turned; and, in|&s;tead of butchers keeping company with people of fa&s;hion, people of fa&s;hion &s;hould be obliged to keep company with butchers.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="63">
Getting this knack of &s;etting people to rights, I was the other day voted unani|mou&s;ly Chief Ju&s;tice of the Fleet, for you mu&s;t know we have a regular court, and a code of excellent laws; and I mean to be as equitable as Sancho in his government. I have done but little yet, only reconciled a few family brawls, and prevented &s;ome mi&s;chief in con&s;equence of two or three religious controver&s;ies. What have fa|milies to do with quarrelling here! Have they not had enough of quarrelling with the world? And what bu&s;ine&s;s have men to talk here upon any &s;ubject of religion but patience? It puts me in mind of two cabin boys. How often, &s;aid one, have you prayers? Why, &s;aid the other, in a gale of wind, and &s;ometimes of a Sunday. Ay now, &s;aid the fir&s;t, there is &s;ome &s;en&s;e in that; but our &s;wab of a chaplain makes us &s;ay prayers when there is no more call for it than to knock one's head again&s;t the main ma&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="64">
But I forgot, Hannah, that you are in a &s;ituation to make remarks of a piece with mine. Better fortune to us both. Tell Hewit he is a good fellow for paying you &s;o much attention.</P>

<P>I received &s;everal other letters from my brother, one of which, in particular, gave me great plea&s;ure; for it informed me that &s;ome per&s;on had privately &s;ent him a hundred pounds; which, as he did not know who to return it to, he &s;aid he &s;hould con&s;ider as his own, in hopes he &s;hould one day or other find the owner and be able to pay him two for it in return.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. AN EXTRAORDINARY MEEETING&mdash;AN EXTRAORDI|NARY PIECE OF INTELLIGENCE&mdash;AN EXTRAORDI|NARY JOURNEY&mdash;AN EXTRAORDINARY FRIEND&mdash;AND AN EXTRAORDINARY REVERSE OF FORTUNE.</HEAD>
<P>BEING at Liece&s;ter, as I was one morn|ing going to market to buy our day's pro|vi&s;ions, which I always took care, though homely, &s;hould be clean and whole&s;ome, I pa&s;&s;ed by the county jail; and when I came to the begging grate, I dropt a half|penny in the box, at which a wretched wo|man, in a melancholy tone, &s;aid, 'Heaven ble&s;s you good lady.' Alas, I am no lady, &s;aid I, I wi&s;h I was, and rich enough to re|lieve all the di&s;tre&s;s of this pri&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="67">
I had &s;carce uttered the&s;e words when a man in a mo&s;t &s;qualid condition came forward, crying out "Who calls on Ach|met! Did not Barbaro&s;&s;a require me here? Nay do not mock me, I am weak and fooli&s;h. Methinks I &s;hould know you. It is, it is, 'tis Hannah Hewit! I now re|member well each circum&s;tance!"</P>
<P>The reader already &s;ees that this cu|rious rhap&s;ody could proceed from no|body but poor Walme&s;ley; but how he came there, and in &s;uch a condition, was beyond my conception, and it was utterly impo&s;&s;ible to learn it from him at that mo|ment; at the &s;ame time, as a mob was ga|thering round us, I put &s;ome &s;ilver into his hand, begged him to get &s;ome refre&s;h|ment, and promi&s;ed him that Hewit and I would pay him a vi&s;it in the cour&s;e of an hour.</P>
<P>The keeper of the jail, who, &s;eeing the
<PB N="66" REF="68">
people a&s;&s;emble, came to learn what was the matter, paid particular attention to the latter part of our conver&s;ation. He &s;eemed extremely plea&s;ed at the pro&s;pect of con|juring up, a friend for Walme&s;ley, and &s;aid, that if Mr. Hewit and I would come and take a bit of dinner, he had a &s;nug little parlour, and would take care that we &s;hould be charged very rea&s;onably.</P>
<P>All this I related to Hewit, who agreed to take the children and &s;pend the day with poor Walme&s;ley in the ca&s;tle, to whom we had previou&s;ly, however, con|veyed &s;ome clean things; and, really, what with being thus refre&s;hed, and his plea&s;ure at finding his old friends, by the time we arrived, he looked very decent, and appeared full of vivacity.</P>
<P>Walme&s;ley told us, that he had been ru|ined by falling under the di&s;plea&s;ure of the college of phy&s;icians. They had gained over the two licentiates, who, in con&s;equence
<PB N="67" REF="69">
of receiving a large &s;hare of the profits ac|cruing from the &s;ale of the Univer&s;al Spe|cific, had &s;igned his petition and procured him a diploma from Gla&s;gow, which cir|cum&s;tance, by the way, I ought to have mentioned before, and it was unanimou&s;ly agreed, by way of rendering a general be|nefit to &s;ociety, to analyze the medicine, in order to pro&s;ecute the vender as an im|po&s;tor; or, by way of giving their pro|ceedings a colour of impartially to re|commend it, provided it &s;hould prove ge|nuine in its purport, and &s;alutary in its effect.</P>
<P>After a mo&s;t elaborate chemical inqui|&s;ition, they very gravely, and deliberately gave a report that the no&s;trum in que&s;tion was a vile impo&s;ition, and not in any wi&s;e calculated to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es for which it was intended, being devi&s;ed, not only to de&s;troy the health, but ridicule the under&s;tandings of his maje&s;ty's liege &s;ub|jects;
<PB N="68" REF="70">
for that the E&s;&s;ence of May Dew, as they had proved by many ingenious ex|periments, was only an efferve&s;cence, pro|duced by &s;our &s;mall beer and magni&s;ia alba; and that the &s;pirit, &s;o far from being the true &s;pirit of owl's dung, was&mdash;which had been rendered demon&s;trable by a mo&s;t &s;ubtle and complex proce&s;s, from whence had ari&s;en various phenomenae, hereafter to be enumerated in a publication in|tended for the information of the Royal Society, and the edification of the whole world&mdash;neither more nor le&s;s than an ex|tract from the excrement of a goo&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e gentlemen learned in phy&s;ic had, therefore, recour&s;e to other gentlemen learned in the law; and, between them both, poor Walme&s;ley was &s;o handled that he was glad enough to &s;ell off his gallipots &s;tock and block, and decamp with the &s;hattered remains of his fortune.</P>
<P>He immediately endeavoured to find
<PB N="69" REF="71">
us, but as we had ju&s;t at that time changed our route, in con&s;equence of our being &s;u&s;pected of belonging to a gang of gip|&s;ies, and had not informed my brother of it, he took a wrong road, and had been travelling about as an actor for &s;everal months, when chance had brought us to|gether in the extraordinary manner I have above related.</P>
<P>The reader knows that Walme&s;ley was perpetually ruining him&s;elf for other peo|ple. Upon our a&s;king him how he came there, he &s;aid, it was all to &s;ave poor Dick Douce from limbo. Well, but, &s;aid Hewit, why could not he as well go to limbo as you? 'Oh lord a different thing!' &s;aid Walme&s;ley, 'I en't married, I have not got a fine &s;latternly wife and three filthy children &s;qualling round me, be|&s;ides the fellow was in the jaundice; looked as yellow as a guinea, a colour his pocket had been long a &s;tranger to. Oh the obligation of my violent love outran the
<PB N="70" REF="72">
pau&s;e of rea&s;on! In &s;hort I took the thing upon my&s;elf, who could refrain that had a heart to love, and in that heart courage to make his love known? And &s;o you &s;ee Dick's gone on with the company, and I am here. No more of that, I have done the &s;tate &s;ome &s;ervice, and they know it.</P>
<P>'Now, after all, people talk of a pri|&s;on, what is there in a pri&s;on? I dare &s;ay I &s;leep upon as &s;oft a board as any in the place; and then, you &s;ee, what a nice clean &s;hirt I have got on; and again, for jail di&s;tempers, all a joke, the healthie&s;t place in the world; the devil of any di&s;|temper have I had &s;ince I came here but hunger.'</P>
<P>When it grew towards du&s;k, and we were about to take leave of Walme&s;ley, the gaoler came in and &s;aid he hoped every thing had been to our &s;atisfaction, he then begged he might be his tiff of punch. After it was brought in, he began to talk
<PB N="71" REF="73">
of his profe&s;&s;ion, which he wi&s;hed to give us an idea he had exerci&s;ed with a true regard to tho&s;e feelings which induce men to comfort in&s;tead of in&s;ult the afflicted.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, for example, that if he had the &s;tuff again&s;t John Hewit, E&s;q. late living in Cock&s;pur-&s;treet, the Hay-market, and was by accident to &s;urprize him in his travelling dre&s;s of a razor-grinder, why did any body think he would go for to treat him, and &s;weet madam Hewit, in an out of the way manner. No; he knew what breeding was, and how to behave to a gemman that was a gemman. Hollo, &s;aid Hewit, why this is the &s;econd act of the Vigo bu&s;ine&s;s!&mdash;Come, come, &s;aid I, Sir, if you have any drift in this, let us know it. 'Why then, if you will have the long and the &s;hort on't,' &s;aid the gaoler, 'I have got the &s;tuff again&s;t John Hewit for three hun|dred and thirty pounds, at the &s;uit of Me&s;&s;rs. Winkworth and Broadhead, and
<PB N="72" REF="74">
when the attorney writes to town, I ex|pects to have a good deal more.'</P>
<P>"How!' &s;aid Walme&s;ley, 'the prince's near ally, my very friend hath got his mor|tal hurt in my behalf. Away to Heaven re&s;pective lenity, and fire eyed fury be my conduct now!" 'Come, come, none of of your fury,' &s;aid the gaoler, 'you have been treated pretty well &s;ince you have been here, I'm &s;ure; if I had not known you to be an actor man, with your antics and monkey tricks, I &s;hould have called in the crowner and put you in a &s;trait wai&s;t-before now.'</P>
<P>Well, Sir, &s;aid I, there is no need of altercation, we are your pri&s;oners. 'You e'nt, madam,' &s;aid the gaoler, I wi&s;h you was; though, damme, if I &s;hould not like to be your pri&s;oner, for you are a nice, hand&s;ome bit.' "Come, Sir," &s;aid Hewit, "there is no nece&s;&s;ity. to in&s;ult my wife; &s;hew me your warrant, and &s;end for the
<PB N="73" REF="75">
mo&s;t eminent attorney in your place, you have neither to treat with fools, nor beg|gars.</P>
<P>'I beg your pardon, '&s;quire Hewit,' &s;aid the gaoler, 'I always knows how to treat they that have money to &s;pend. As for you, ma'am, I beg your pardon too; but I'll be damned if I don't think you as hand&s;ome a bit of goods as ever I &s;aw for all that, let your hu&s;band be ever &s;o much affronted. I wi&s;h you may get clear of the bu&s;ine&s;s, for I knows &s;ome of the clan, and if what I heard ye&s;terday, &s;hould be but true, the brother of a certain lady, in my eye, as the parliament men &s;ays in their debates, &s;tands a good chance, if he don't mind his hits, of dancing upon nothing.'</P>
<P>I told him I had no doubt but that his intentions were perfectly hand&s;ome, and proper; that, to be &s;ure, in a &s;ituation like that, people could expect no favour but
<PB N="74" REF="76">
in proportion as they paid their way, that, fortunately, we did not want money, and all the &s;ervice required of the attorney, at pre&s;ent, would be to move my hu&s;band by a habeas corpus into the Fleet, where my brother was, with whom we &s;hould like to con&s;ult as we were all embarked, as it were, in a common cau&s;e.</P>
<P>We had truly de&s;cribed our &s;ituation to the gaoler; for in ca&s;e of this very emergency, we had laid by fifty pounds as a depo&s;it to extricate us from all diffi|culty. As for Walme&s;ley, as the &s;even debts he &s;tood engaged for, contracted by Douce, amounted to no more than eleven pounds, the &s;um he had been taken in exe|cution for by virtue of a warrant of attor|ney, given to one man in tru&s;t for the whole, which he had the cunning to ma|nage, in order to avoid multiplying the co&s;ts, we compounded them, &s;et him free, and &s;ent him forward to London.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="77">
Thus, after waiting all the nece&s;&s;ary ceremonies, and being treated very li|berally by the gaoler, who had a regard for my elder brother, becau&s;e he had &s;hewn &s;ome civility to a Bri&s;tol turnkey, who afterwards turned &s;ailor; and a rooted di&s;like to my other brother, who had pro|mi&s;ed to protect a friend of his, a king's evidence, and afterwards got him tran|&s;ported; we came to an anchor, as my brother called it, in his Maje&s;ty's Fleet, on the 5th of March, 1775.</P>
<P>Walme&s;ley, who was waiting for us at the gate, &s;aid that they had di&s;covered a plot: Fir&s;t, &s;aid he, it mu&s;t be a plot, be|cau&s;e there is a lawyer in it; &s;econdly, it mu&s;t be a plot, becau&s;e there is a Jew in it; thirdly, it mu&s;t be a plot, becau&s;e there is a parliament man in it; and, fourthly, it mu&s;t be a plot, becau&s;e&mdash;'You &s;tupid fellow you don't know what to make of it,'
<PB N="76" REF="78">
&s;aid my brother, who came up as Wal|me&s;ley was &s;peaking.</P>
<P>'Hannah, my dear girl,' continued he, 'how are you? Jack give us your hand, come with me; I have &s;omething to tell you. I think we &s;hall get afloat if we keep a good look out.'</P>
<P>We went with my brother into his room, where he gave us the following in|telligence: A parliament man, who was con&s;iderably in debt, had rea&s;on to be|lieve that a Jew, to whom he was under many and material obligations, would, on a di&s;olution of parliament, endeavour to &s;ecure his per&s;on on an execution, under an idea, that during the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, the per&s;on of a member of parliament was not inviolable.</P>
<P>This gentleman's apprehen&s;ions were well grounded, for he was &s;topt getting
<PB N="77" REF="79">
into his chai&s;e to &s;et out for his Borough, and the Jew having indemnified the offi|cers, they carried him to a Spunging-hou&s;e. As there was no parliament to apply to, and his intere&s;t in the Borough began &s;o to totter, that he would certainly have lo&s;t his &s;eat if he had not been pre|&s;ent, finding the Jew inexorable, he com|mi&s;&s;ioned my brother, the lawyer, and Sourby, to tamper with him, giving them the be&s;t &s;ecurity he could find in the mi|nority, on which &s;ide he happened to be, for five hundred pounds, to be paid on the day of his being returned to parliament.</P>
<P>They knew that tampering with the Jew, like dipping red hot iron in cold wa|ter, would only harden him the more. They, therefore, forged in his name, an or|der to the &s;heriff's officer to liberate the gentleman; who availing him&s;elf of the opportunity, not the fraud, for he did not know one word of that, &s;tole down to the
<PB N="78" REF="80">
Borough, was re-elected, and thus his per|&s;on became as &s;acred as ever.</P>
<P>The moment the new&s;papers an|nounced the return of the new parliament, and our gentleman as one of the members, the Jew in&s;tantly went to con&s;ult his at|torney, as to how far he could an&s;wer to keep him in the cu&s;tody of the &s;heriff, where he thought he &s;till had him &s;ecure; but when he found that his enlargement was nefariou&s;ly procured, at a time when his per&s;on was as attachable as the per&s;on of any body el&s;e, both he and the attorney were clearly of opinion that he might go again&s;t the &s;heriff.</P>
<P>Searching further, however, it became evident that neither the &s;heriff, nor the member had been to blame. The fir&s;t, or rather his officer, having acted in con|formity, as far as he knew, with the Jew's own order; and the other, &s;o far from

<PB N="79" REF="81">
being acce&s;&s;ary to the fraud, on his return to town, had thanked him for his indul|gence, and a&s;&s;ured him, that as &s;oon as the mini&s;try changed, he would honourably di&s;charge every demand again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Upon a minuter enquiry, he found that my brother, the lawyer, and Sourby was at the bottom of it, but he knew their charac|ters &s;o well that he had no doubt, if the mat|ter was to be inve&s;tigated, they would both &s;wear, to &s;ave them&s;elves, that he &s;igned the order in their pre&s;ence. He, there|fore, contented him&s;elf with getting it re|turned to him, and making no further &s;tir about it for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>It &s;o happened that the character of this Jew was of a peculiar ca&s;t. His com|mon conduct was like the common con|duct of his brethren. He enriched him|&s;elf by taking advantage of folly, but he appropriated his gains by the &s;trict line of true wi&s;dom. He preyed upon vice to

relieve virtue. The riches he wrung from villany, he lavi&s;hed on goodne&s;s; and while he was publickly execrated as a Jew, and a devil, he was privately adored as a chri&s;tian, and an angel. He was, in gro&s;s, what Walme&s;ley was in little; and though he did not go to pri&s;on to exonerate his friends, he had his Dick Douces, whom he often came into pri&s;on to relieve.</P>
<P>It has &s;ometimes &s;truck me that &s;uch a character would do well for the &s;tage. &s;uch a man without o&s;tentation, without egoti&s;m, beneficent without parade, noble with humility, never the hero of his own little tale, &s;eeking no prai&s;e but the te&s;ti|mony of his own heart, a mi&s;er in virtue, not in money; though no novelty, I tru&s;t, in nature, would certainly be one to the drama.</P>
<P>One kind action, liberally rewarded, &s;ometimes makes amends for many which
<PB N="81" REF="85">
are returned by ingratitude. This hap|pened in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. My elder bro|ther, who had toiled, and ri&s;ked every thing for his owners, was thrown into pri|&s;on for his pains. He had on that very voyage done a common act of humanity to this Jew, and mark the difference! The chri&s;tians had plunged him into di&s;tre&s;s and obloquy, the Jew, the moment he heard of his &s;ituation, meditated how he might relieve him. Nay, it was from him, as the reader probably has gue&s;&s;ed, that he received the hundred pounds.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tance was this: The Jew and his family having embarked from Smyrna for England, their &s;hip caught fire at &s;ea. It &s;o happened that my brother was near enough in his &s;hip to lend him a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and &s;o well did his inclination &s;timulate his exertions, that, what with his boats and their own, though the &s;hip burnt to the water's edge, very few lives were
<PB N="82" REF="86">
lo&s;t, and much more of the property was &s;aved than they had the &s;malle&s;t rea&s;on to expect.</P>
<P>The Jew, his family, and his property, were &s;aved. My brother was not, at that time, bound for England; he, therefore, put them all on board another Strieght&s;|man, and wi&s;hed them a good voyage, re|fu&s;ing to accept any gratuity, his &s;ervices having been occa&s;ioned by mere chance, and performed from motives of common humanity.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tance, however, had never from that moment e&s;caped the Jew, who, when he came to find, upon examining the bu&s;ine&s;s of the forgery to the bottom, that my brother, the lawyer, and Sourby, had been indirectly concerned in my brother's &s;hip, and were a part of that ne&s;t who had &s;ent him to pri&s;on, he was determined to procure him ample redre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="87">
Little, indeed, did he know till that ac|cidental di&s;covery, which was not a&s;toni&s;h|ing, u&s;urers, and other nefarious characters, frequently con&s;ulting him as one of their own clan, that his benefactor was langui&s;h|ing in a pri&s;on, through the connivance of his own brother. His determination was prompt and efficacious. He fir&s;t took care to prove, by unque&s;tionable te&s;ti|mony, that he had not been in town on the day the order was &s;igned to relea&s;e the member of parliament. He then &s;ent for my brother, and Sourby, upon an errand that induced them readily to attend, and told them, in &s;o many words, that they mu&s;t relea&s;e my brother from pri&s;on, or he would not only hang them both for forgery, but that he would &s;o completely break up their gang, that they &s;hould never dare to &s;hew their faces again in the kingdom.</P>
<P>In &s;hort he knew what &s;ort of argu|ment
<PB N="84" REF="88">
to u&s;e, and he &s;ucceded; but before he lo&s;t &s;ight of them, he exacted a condi|tional bond to the amount of the monies for which my brother was impri&s;oned, to be forfeited if they did not procure his enlargement by a given day.</P>
<P>With this news the Jew had, on the morning we arrived, acquainted my bro|ther; who, informing him how we had been u&s;ed, he declared that he would take care, in the &s;ettling of the bu&s;ine&s;s, to in|clude us in the treaty.</P>
<P>Many days had not elap&s;ed before my brother and Hewit were di&s;charged from confinement, and now general relea&s;es pa&s;&s;ed between all parties that had been either immediately, or collaterally, con|cerned in any of the tran&s;actions.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. THE SEA OF HANNAH's FORTUNE HAVING BECOME CALM, APPEARS, GRADUALLY, TO BE AGITATED; SHE MEETS, UNEXPECTEDLY, WITH AN OLD FRIEND, WHO SHE HAS SCARCELY SPOKEN TO WHEN JOHN AND SHE ARE OBLIGED TO TAKE SHELTER IN FLIGHT.</HEAD>
<P>WE had now the world to begin again. As for my brother, through the intere&s;t of the Jew, he got to be &s;econd-mate of an Ea&s;t-Indiaman, with &s;uch recommenda|tions as were &s;ure to procure him the com|mand of a &s;hip in the country &s;ervice on his arrival; and as it was probable he would &s;oon have a good deal in his power, at his earne&s;t entreaty, I tru&s;ted my &s;on to his care.</P>
<P>As for our&s;elves, Hewit got to be
<PB N="86" REF="90">
foreman to a capital tin man, and I was furni&s;hed with as much work in various ways from &s;hops as I could perform; and as for poor Walme&s;ley, he &s;oon after em|barked for Ireland, in con&s;equence of a liberal offer made him by the manager of the Dublin Theatre, and the la&s;t thing we heard of him was, that he died in con&s;e|quence of a cold he had caught by lend|ing his bed to accommodate a family in di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>I own I dropt a tear of the mo&s;t poig|nant regret at this news, and thinking on all his various quotations, which were &s;o apt, and had &s;o much of the heart in them, I exclaimed, 'Alas poor Walme&s;ley! he had a mind mild as mercy, and a hand open as day for tender hearted charity.'</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation we went on pretty comfortably, and lived &s;o &s;aving, that in le&s;s than &s;ix months, we furni&s;hed a very &s;nug hou&s;e; and having experienced all
<PB N="87" REF="91">
the vici&s;&s;itudes of high and low life, we were now placed in a middle &s;tate, that &s;tate &s;aid to be, of all others, the mo&s;t to be coveted.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ay, however, that I found any alteration in the world. It was &s;till the &s;ame vain &s;upercilious, ridiculous world I had ever known it; and the mid|dle &s;tate, by &s;tanding between the two ex|tremities, affecting the hauteur of the one, and embibing the vulgarity of the other, exhibited &s;uch a &s;trange mixture of pride and meanne&s;s, &s;uch an incongruous col|lection of finery and filth, &s;uch a hetero|genious, pyeballed, jumble of patch work gentility, that it &s;eemed to be both, and neither; like a magpie &s;tanding between a crow and a &s;wan.</P>
<P>I could have been extremely well con|tent, neverthele&s;s, in this &s;ituation, had fortune cea&s;ed to torment us, and had my hu&s;band been always with me. It is true
<PB N="88" REF="92">
when he came home to dinner, or at night, ab&s;ence gave a ze&s;t to our meetings; but then we had always &s;ome little unplea&s;ant matter to talk over; and among the re&s;t, our troubles, like embers half extin|gui&s;hed, began, now and then, to &s;hew a di&s;po&s;ition to rekindle.</P>
<P>When men are involved in partner|&s;hips, and in the habit of &s;igning notes, whether on their own account, or to ac|commodate others, there is no an&s;wering for their &s;afety. One litigation begets an|other, till they are &s;o involved, that no fortune can make a &s;tand again&s;t the va|rious attacks of cunning and chicanery.</P>
<P>Many things of this kind &s;tood out again&s;t us, which, certainly, the general relea&s;es had virtually done away; but hav|ing been improvident enough not to take them up, they got into various hands, and we were perpetually pe&s;tered with per&s;ons who tendered them for payment. It is
<PB N="89" REF="93">
true, a court of ju&s;tice would have re|lieved us, but who is there that does not find even winning at law a &s;evere lo&s;s? A man &s;ued us upon one of the&s;e notes for twenty pounds; he was ca&s;t; but having thrown him&s;elf into the King's Bench, we had our own attorney's bill to pay, which came to &s;eventeen pounds.</P>
<P>The&s;e things brought us into every kind of di&s;grace; our friends began, as formerly, to look cool upon us, we were afraid of our own &s;hadows, and it was, once more, thought expedient to con&s;ider what to do to avoid a pri&s;on. Hewit pro|po&s;ed following my brother to India, where, he &s;aid, we &s;hould certainly do great things; but this propo&s;al I &s;trenuou&s;ly re&s;i&s;ted, nor could I ever think of it with|out &s;huddering; therefore, at la&s;t, he left off urging it. At length, as nothing could prevent our doing extremely well, if we could once be free, we determined to
<PB N="90" REF="94">
mu&s;ter all the money we could, and go to France, in order that Hewit might take the benefit of the next act of in&s;olvency as a fugitive.</P>
<P>We were in great forwardne&s;s when our operations were retarded by the &s;ickne&s;s of our little girl, who&s;e di&s;order, a violent fever, after I had been her nur&s;e for a fortnight, baffled every &s;kill, and &s;he died in my arms.</P>
<P>As this melancholy event had pre|vented me from fini&s;hing &s;ome work, for which I was to be very well paid, I was obliged, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, to labour with redoubled a&s;&s;iduity; and this, together with the de&s;pondency into which I was thrown at lo&s;ing my child, brought on a complaint on my &s;pirits, which I very much feared would be attended with &s;e|rious con&s;equences.</P>
<P>As I grew better, Hewit did the ut|mo&s;t
<PB N="91" REF="95">
in his power to keep up my &s;pirits; and, among the re&s;t, frequently took me to the play, where we were &s;ome|times accompanied by a lady who had &s;hewn me a great deal of attention; and who, though there was certainly a &s;ort of levity about her that was, at times, not &s;trictly proper, had &s;omething extremely engaging, and good natured in her man|ner.</P>
<P>This lady was a widow, her name was Vint. She had a relation who had a con|cern in one of the Theatres, and thus &s;he could get orders whenever &s;he plea&s;ed. Hewit and I, therefore, availed our&s;elves of this privilege; and, in return, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed a good deal of time at our hou&s;e; which, on account of her &s;prightly temper, was very agreeable to John, and, indeed, to me, as &s;he had a mo&s;t happy knack of laughing off that particular chagrin occa|&s;ioned by pecuniary di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="96">
We had all three &s;ettled it to go to a new play; but Hewit having received a me&s;&s;age to call upon an attorney, who he always kept upon the look out, to watch whenever any immediate danger threat|ened, &s;aid, he feared he could not be in time for us; and, therefore, begged we would go, telling us that he would find us at the theatre. I drank tea with Mrs. Vint, and we went from her hou&s;e together. No Hewit, however, came; at which, indeed, I was no farther concerned than at the lo&s;s of his company, and le&s;t his bu&s;ine&s;s with the lawyer &s;hould have turned out of a more &s;erious nature than he had ex|pected.</P>
<P>The play being over, as we were wait|ing in the lobby, while a friend of Mrs. Vint was gone in que&s;t of a coach, I thought I &s;aw in the croud a man I knew. At the &s;ame moment I caught his eye, and he &s;eemed to know me. Approaching each other I cried out, "Gracious Hea|ven
<PB N="93" REF="97">
Mr. Binns!' and he, almo&s;t in the &s;ame in&s;tant reiterated, 'Is it po&s;&s;ible that I &s;ee my dear Hannah!' "I declare," cried I, "I never was &s;o &s;urprized and &s;o plea&s;ed in my life! How is your &s;i&s;ter?" 'She is married, my love,' &s;aid Binns, 'and as for me&mdash;' but &s;eeing every one looking at us in a &s;tate of a&s;toni&s;hment, 'I cannot,' added he, 'explain any thing here; it would intere&s;t you too much; be&s;ides I have company with me. Where do you live?' I gave him my addre&s;s, made him promi&s;e to come to me the next day, and as at that moment the gen|tleman returned with intelligence that the coach was ready, we went towards the door and lo&s;t him in the croud.</P>
<P>I &s;at Mrs. Vint down at her hou&s;e, and bid the coachman make all the ha&s;te he could to mine; for, &s;urprized as I was at &s;eeing Binns, I was &s;till impatient to &s;ee Hewit. But this was to be a night of
<PB N="94" REF="98">
a&s;toni&s;hment. I found every thing packed up in readine&s;s to be &s;ent away.</P>
<P>Hewit, who was in the parlour with a broker, told me that an annuity bond, to which I knew he had &s;igned his name as &s;ecurity, had become forfeited; and the news the attorney wanted to inform him of was, that the next day an execution would be brought into the hou&s;e for two hundred and &s;eventy pounds. In con&s;e|quence of this, not having a moment to lo&s;e, he had &s;ent for a broker, had &s;old every thing to him, and had received the money. He added, that our cloaths were packed up, a chai&s;e was in readine&s;s, and that he meant, if po&s;&s;ible, to reach Dover by the morning, with a view to embark for France, le&s;t they &s;hould change their ground and &s;ue out a writ of execution again&s;t his per&s;on.</P>
<P>As we had determined to take this
<PB N="95" REF="99">
&s;tep as &s;oon as it &s;hould be convenient, and nece&s;&s;ity now left the time no longer a matter of choice, I con&s;ented with ala|crity, and in three days we were &s;afely landed at Calais.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP VIII. A DESCRIPTION OF THE FRENCH, HANNAH'S PREDIC|TION, SHE RETURNS TO ENGLAND, A TEMPORARY CALM IS SUCCEEDED BY FAMILY DISQUIET, WHICH TERMINATES IN A FATAL SEPARATION.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING &s;ufficient money to la&s;t us, with oeconomy, while it was probable we might remain in France, I was determined, as I had no other employ, to make my&s;elf a proficient in the language, and lay up in my mind a &s;tore of literature; which, indeed, was of &s;o much &s;ervice to me, that it perfectly and completely &s;upplied for me the place of a regular cla&s;&s;ical education.</P>
<P>I perfected my&s;elf al&s;o in one &s;tudy
<PB N="97" REF="101">
more, which was &s;o obvious, and &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to avoid it. I mean a &s;tudy of the people, and their manners; and now it was that I &s;aw, if the world was faulty in my own country, how much the term ought to be magnified &s;peaking of France.</P>
<P>Go where I would I found nothing but human wolves di&s;gui&s;ing their natural ferocity with the grimace of monkies. At market, in a &s;hop, whatever was the co|modity, its commendation was &s;weetened with &s;ome gro&s;s compliment to induce the purcha&s;e of it. Either your gown was a hand&s;ome pattern, your hair was a beautiful colour, and then you were En|gli&s;h, that was enough; meaning it was enough to afford them an opportunity of cheating you, and laughing at you at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>Among one another the &s;ubtilty was
<PB N="98" REF="102">
more refined. All had &s;ome artful point to carry, and to glo&s;s over. Thus a <HI>bon mot</HI> hid a de&s;ign, a <HI>Jeux d'e&s;prit</HI> covered a <HI>manoeuvre,</HI> and a <HI>coup de vivacite</HI> con|cealed a <HI>coup de grace;</HI> for the more bril|liant the wit, the more pointed the &s;ally, the more it re&s;embled the gleam that pre|cedes the &s;troke of a lifted dagger.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t &s;hocking trait of their di&s;&s;imulation was their affecting to believe in a religion which, in &s;ecret, they laughed at. This went to the root of all &s;ocial or|der; for to impo&s;e upon each other what no one credited, was, in its nature, &s;uch a bla&s;phemy, and begat &s;uch a rooted hy|pocri&s;y, that neighbour could not be &s;afe with neighbour.</P>
<P>Oh how I have contemplated this peo|ple! Specious, guarded, fawning, fraud|ful, faithle&s;s, volatile, &s;anguinary, and mercile&s;s; and the&s;e qualities they put off to &s;trangers for openne&s;s, carefulne&s;s,
<PB N="99" REF="103">
breeding, prudence, vivacity, gallantry, courage, and greatne&s;s. In &s;hort, I found a Frenchman an animated lie, that &s;hould be rever&s;ed to be under&s;tood. Alas! &s;aid I, the&s;e were the Gauls that were &s;o faith|le&s;s to Cae&s;ar! What are they, now that they have added to their native ferocity, con&s;ummate art? I tremble for their coun|try; I dread, le&s;t in one horrible moment, the French nation, memorable for crime, memorable for treachery, memorable for barbarity; &s;hall undergo a tremendous internal convul&s;ion, and that, like Etna, it &s;hall vomit forth its own bowels to de&s;olate the country around,</P>
<P>I &s;aw the Court of France; I &s;aw it in the moment of its mo&s;t &s;plendid bril|liancy. It was when the Emperor was there to &s;olicit the hand of the King's &s;i&s;ter. But he never married her. That man contemplated the country as I did. He thought, probably, an alliance with it
<PB N="100" REF="104">
might endanger his own crown. He &s;aw there could be no &s;ecurity where there was no honour; no &s;tability where there was no &s;incerity. He &s;aw his own &s;i&s;ter the puppet of that court. He &s;aw it, and lamented it. Poor, &s;plendid, beautiful, amiable, unhappy wretch; fal&s;ely deified by de&s;igning men, who&s;e ambitious views were to make her beauty their bait, to lure her to de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Among the foremo&s;t of the&s;e was that horrid wretch the Duke D'Orleans. He who introduced Engli&s;h noblemen, and other foreigners to the Queen, and, af|terwards, like a low backbiter, whi&s;pered away her reputation. He who converted his countrymen from monkies to bears, by making them ape Engli&s;h grooms. I &s;hould not wonder if that man de|&s;troyed his country by the hands of vil|lains, and that tho&s;e villains &s;hould make his carca&s;e the foot &s;tool of their power.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="105">
Among this frivolous, this contempti|ble, this proud, this mean, this arrogant, this &s;upercilious people, we re&s;ided nearly a year and a half; during which time I &s;aw no one &s;ingle in&s;tance that could in|duce me to retract an iota of that ineffable pity, and &s;overeign contempt, which every day's experience of them excited. There may have been virtuous individuals, and no doubt there were; it did not fall to my lot to know them. But I'll give a rea&s;on why I &s;u&s;pect there were fewer in France than any where.</P>
<P>The high are too tyranic, the low are too &s;ervile, and yet they are the &s;ame creature; the lord oppre&s;&s;es his va&s;&s;al, the va&s;&s;al domineers over his labourer, the labourer beats his dog, and the dog worries his rat; yet each turns back in re&s;entment. Every Frenchman knows every thing better than any body; is a better calculator, a better politician, a better lawyer, a better ruler than any
<PB N="102" REF="106">
body; and I &s;hould not wonder if upon the &s;ame principal that tin&s;el and cala|manco, ape fattin and lace among them; that &s;hould ever a revolution take place in that devoted country, which, for the &s;ake of Europe, of the world, of human nature, may Heaven avert; &s;hould order be de|&s;troyed, virtue confounded, religion ani|hilated, the crown trampled under foot, and riot, anarchy, and ma&s;&s;acre reign tri|umphant, it would be accompli&s;hed by the lowe&s;t dregs of the people who would lord it and tyrannize over the re&s;t.</P>
<P>In June, 1778, we arrived in town; and in two months, from that time, John Hewit took the benefit of an act of in&s;ol|vency that had lately pa&s;&s;ed; which &s;tep, as he had no debts that he could legally con&s;ider as his own, his friends, one and all commended.</P>
<P>I could not, however, reconcile him cordially to it. He con&s;idered it as a
<PB N="103" REF="107">
di&s;grace, and though we began to get for|ward, his former ma&s;ter having taken him again as his foreman, and the &s;hops being ready, as formerly, to &s;upply me with work, yet his continual cry was that he did not like to have his name recorded among a &s;et of &s;windlers, and others, who had defrauded hone&s;t trade&s;men out of their legal demands.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, to clinch this bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;ome of our creditors, from vexatious motives, were determined to litigate their claims with us. The&s;e I began to be afraid were &s;et on by my brother, the lawyer, and Sourby; and to make all &s;ure, the annuity bu&s;ine&s;s &s;till &s;tood out again&s;t us, except as to Hewit's per&s;on; for though the act cleared him up to the time of its date, yet it gave no relief as to property acquired afterwards.</P>
<P>As this kept us perpetually at law with either beggars, or rogues, which always
<PB N="104" REF="108">
co&s;t us &s;omething, and as our fears were more than imaginary, relative to the an|nuity, I really could not blame Hewit's unea&s;ine&s;s; and, at la&s;t, indeed, I began to make my&s;elf quite wretched about it. He grew melancholy, his temper was &s;oured, he lo&s;t his health; and, though he certainly loved me tenderly, when I have ventured to carre&s;s him, he would &s;ome|times received me coldly, while a tear &s;tood in his eye.</P>
<P>Formerly a wi&s;h, expre&s;&s;ed in a hint, accelerated his endeavours to oblige and plea&s;e me; now, there &s;eemed to be &s;ome|thing unrea&s;onable in all I wi&s;hed. I had informed him, of cour&s;e, of my interview with Binns in the lobby of the playhou&s;e, at which time he expre&s;&s;ed an anxiety to know what he could mean; now, when I propo&s;ed &s;etting about an enquiry how we might find him, and, indeed, I had taken &s;ome &s;teps towards it, it was all wrong. What had we to do with Binns? Perhaps
<PB N="105" REF="109">
he belonged to the gang of ra&s;cals who per&s;ecuted us; but Binns was &s;uch a gal|lant protector, that no wonder I was con|&s;tantly thinking of him.</P>
<P>It had been his delight to fondle a &s;weet girl that fortune ble&s;&s;ed me with about eight months after we arrived in France; now he could not bear the &s;ight of the little creature. This I own grieved me to the &s;oul, which very grief became now an offence. I certainly paid the child additional attention for his neglect of it; I offended in that, I was always thinking of non&s;en&s;e when we ought to con&s;ider what was to become of us.</P>
<P>This was hard, and it was not at all in the &s;tyle of John Hewit. It was unkind, and almo&s;t unmanly. It was &s;omething like jealou&s;y, but that was impo&s;&s;ible; for he never in his life had a moment's cau&s;e for &s;u&s;picion of me. It &s;eemed to be a &s;ort of trial of my affection, as if he wi&s;hed to
<PB N="106" REF="110">
excite jealou&s;y in me, but that was equally impo&s;&s;ible. I knew him to be all &s;oul, all honour; and though I had been told a hundred idle &s;tories when we were in pro|&s;perity, when in adver&s;ity, when in mid|ling life, when in France, nay, even, &s;ince we returned; my &s;en&s;e of affection was that I ought to have been deprived of his love for ever if I could have been &s;o cru|elly ungenerous as to have &s;u&s;pected it.</P>
<P>I could not help thinking now and then that he had &s;ome advi&s;er, but who could it be? Nobody came near us but that thoughtle&s;s, goodnatured crea|ture Mrs. Vint; who &s;ought us out &s;oon after our arrival in town, and from that time occa&s;ionally vi&s;ited us; and as to her, though out of complai&s;ance he be|haved civilly before her face, I believe in my con&s;cience he di&s;liked her mo&s;t heartily. Nay, when in a moment of af|fection for me, from which he could not &s;ometimes refrain, and at which time he
<PB N="107" REF="111">
would treat me as if his conduct was a re|paration for &s;ome offence meditated or committed, he would declare that no wo|man upon earth ever loved, or de&s;erved to be loved but me.</P>
<P>If it were proper minutely to dwell upon this part of my hi&s;tory, I &s;hould ex|hibit, perhaps, the mo&s;t extraordinary and affecting picture of dome&s;tic di&s;quiet that ever was drawn. Tender, anxious, &s;oli|citous expo&s;tulations on my part; &s;ullen, moody, re&s;erved coldne&s;s on his. Yet he loved me, tenderly loved me, his whole conduct was love; and, indeed, in the end, I had fatal cau&s;e to know it.</P>
<P>I had one evening prepared a ragout for his &s;upper, which I had learnt to cook in France, where of cour&s;e, I perfected my&s;elf in culinary knowledge, and had waited con&s;iderably beyond his u&s;ual hour of returning, when &s;omebody knocked at
<PB N="108" REF="112">
the door. My heart fluttered, for I had determined on that evening to come to an explanation with him, and, I believe, I &s;hould have fainted if I had not drank a gla&s;s of Madeira, a wine I always made a point of indulging him with.</P>
<P>My apprehen&s;ions, however, were more excited by the fear of what would happen than the knowledge of what did. It was not Hewit, it was Mrs. Vint; who &s;aid &s;he had been at the play, and had come, without ceremony, to eat a bit of &s;upper with us; then, turning round, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her a&s;toni&s;hment at not &s;eeing He wit.</P>
<P>I &s;aid he was not come home, but that I expected him every moment; at which &s;he &s;aid, hu&s;bands were &s;trange things; &s;he had had one, but would never have an|other. She then talked of the play, then a&s;ked me if I did not remember that &s;he and I were there together at the time we
<PB N="109" REF="113">
&s;aw Binns, if I did not think him a hand|&s;ome fellow; 'indeed,' &s;aid &s;he, 'by his raptures, I &s;hould have thought you had been old &s;weethearts. Do you know I have often thought Hewit's &s;ulkine&s;s looked liked jealou&s;y of that man? What he might know of him formerly I cannot tell, but it mu&s;t be contemptible, indeed, to fly out &s;o about a &s;ingle interview, and in the pre&s;ence of five hundred people.</P>
<P>As I never conde&s;cended to complain to any one of my hu&s;band &s;o I did not chu&s;e to enter into any conver&s;ation on the &s;ubject; I, therefore, waved her rattling, inqui&s;itive hints, by telling her &s;he was a giddy creature, and that I was &s;ure &s;he knew better how to do ju&s;tice to every body than &s;eriou&s;ly to entertain any &s;uch ab&s;urd &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P>She begged my pardon, &s;aid, to be &s;ure it was no bu&s;ine&s;s of hers, and de&s;ired we might have the &s;upper, for that &s;he was
<PB N="110" REF="114">
hungry, and could plainly &s;ee it would be u&s;ele&s;s to wait for Hewit. Out of com|plai&s;ance I &s;et it before her, for it was pa&s;t twelve o'clock, and &s;he are heartily; for my own part I could eat nothing. As time wore, &s;o our &s;urprize encrea&s;ed; and, at la&s;t the clock &s;truck two, and no Hewit. All this while &s;he had grown warmer and warmer in her exclamations again&s;t him for his treatment of me; till, at length, &s;he ap|peared to be a little intoxicated, to which failing, having a weak head, &s;he certainly was now and then addicted; and as there was nobody to &s;ee her home, which Hewit u&s;ually did, I per&s;uaded her to go to bed, after which I &s;at counting the hours till day light, in vain expectation of my hu&s;band.</P>
<P>It was now nine o'clock, I had ju&s;t re|fre&s;hed my&s;elf with a di&s;h of tea, Mrs. Vint was yet &s;leeping, when the people of the hou&s;e brought me a letter, which they told me was delivered by a porter who
<PB N="111" REF="115">
went away, &s;aying it required no an&s;wer. The letter was from Hewit, and the &s;en|&s;ation I felt on opening it, was like the &s;troke of death.</P>
<P>This letter informed me that he was then underweigh aboard an Ea&s;t-India|man; that he was perfectly convinced I held a criminal intercour&s;e with Binns; that he went upon proof, that he knew of our having had frequent interviews, and his evidence went as far as to &s;ub&s;tantiate that Binns was the father of the child, which, in France, he had fondly imagined to be his. He added, that though he was determined never to &s;ee me again, for he could not &s;tomach living with an adult|tre&s;s, his love for me was uncea&s;ing; that it had become &s;o violent, it was, at la&s;t, un&s;afe for him to tru&s;t him&s;elf in my pre|&s;ence; and that if his religion had not got the better of his madne&s;s, I &s;hould not have lived long to wrong him, for he had
<PB N="112" REF="116">
more than once meditated to murder me in my &s;leep. He concluded by recom|mending me, wicked as I was, to the care of providence; and hoping whatever be|came of him, God would ble&s;s and pro&s;per me; but he feared I could not expect to pro&s;per after making &s;o good a hu&s;band mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>With a trembling frame, my heart &s;unk within me, &s;ick with wretchedne&s;s, and petrified with a&s;toni&s;hment, did I per&s;e|vere till I came to the end of this fatal paper. It &s;eemed a delu&s;ion, a mockery of that imagination which had maddened into a thou&s;and phanta&s;ies during the te|dious night in which I had watched and amu&s;ed my&s;elf with inventing a thou&s;and excu&s;es for the &s;trange conduct of that deluded wretch, the cau&s;e of all my mi|&s;ery and his own.</P>
<P>It was with the utmo&s;t difficulty I could
<PB N="113" REF="117">
go through it. Line after line my impa|tience, my a&s;toni&s;hment, my wretched|ne&s;s, and my de&s;pair increa&s;ed. At length, &s;eeing and, indeed, feeling mo&s;t forcibly, mo&s;t fatally, mo&s;t horribly the pre&s;&s;ure of the finger of fate, I &s;huddered with agony, and fell lifele&s;s on the floor.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP IX. HANNAH'S DISTRESS, THE FATE OF LAWYER HIG|GINS AND SOURBY; HANNAH DEPARTS FOR INDIA; SEES HER BROTHER THE CAPTAIN: RE-EMBARKS IN THE GROSVENOR, AND IS CAST AWAY UPON THE COAST OF AFRICA.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I came to my&s;elf I was &s;urrounded by the people of the hou&s;e and Mrs. Vint; who gave me the letter and told me to take care of it. When I grew &s;ufficiently recovered to explain my&s;elf, I accounted for what had happened, by &s;aying that the &s;atigue of &s;itting up all night, in anxiety on account of my hu&s;band, and my unex|pectedly receiving a letter, which con|vinced me he was &s;afe, had, I &s;uppo&s;ed, oc|ea&s;ioned
<PB N="115" REF="119">
a &s;en&s;ation which had thrown me into the condition they had &s;een, but that I was now perfectly well.</P>
<P>Mrs. Vint &s;aid I was too good to live in this world; and after the people of the hou&s;e had gone down, told me &s;he had read the letter, and plainly &s;aw that my hu&s;band was a villain. I could not bear this, but did not chu&s;e to enter into an ex|planation of my &s;en&s;ations, which were dictated by a delicacy Mrs. Vint was little calculated to feel; neither did I like her having taken the liberty to read the letter. Indeed one part of my reflections during the night had been on the &s;ubject of this la|dy; who, though inoffen&s;ively, I dared &s;ay, had always been too prying. I, therefore, under the preten&s;e of wanting re&s;t, and my incapacity of holding any conver&s;ation on &s;o peculiar a &s;ubject, prevailed on her to retire, and having done &s;o, I re&s;olved, in future, to have as little communication with her as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="120">
In the mean time it was nece&s;&s;ary to have &s;ome friend, and it in&s;tantly &s;truck me, that as intere&s;t is a &s;urer inducement with mankind to a&s;&s;i&s;t one another than any call upon their friend&s;hip, or tye upon their gratitude, &s;o I thought I had hit on the very per&s;on to execute any tru&s;t I &s;hould repo&s;e in him, with &s;trict rectitude and &s;crupulous fidelity.</P>
<P>It was a per&s;on of the name of Morris, who had employed me to paint fan mounts, paper &s;nuff boxes, enamelled watch ca&s;es, and &s;leeve buttons. He had a wife who, though &s;he never a&s;ked me to &s;it down, always, when I brought home my work, took a gla&s;s of cherry brandy her&s;elf, and begged me to take another, probably, be|cau&s;e &s;he knew I &s;hould refu&s;e, and the&s;e people, though I had not the &s;malle&s;t ex|pectation that they would advance an in&s;e|cure &s;ixpence to keep me from &s;tarving, I was &s;ure if I would give up my whole time to them, and afford them a lumping penny|worth,
<PB N="117" REF="121">
would keep my &s;ecret inviolably, and protect me mo&s;t &s;acredly from all per|&s;ecution. Be&s;ides I wi&s;hed my exact &s;tory to be known by &s;ome family of credit, which they really were, by way of evidence in my favour, if it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary hereafter.</P>
<P>Having made my re&s;olution, I took &s;ome repo&s;e, then I went to the&s;e people, and fairly told them my &s;tory; propo&s;ing that while I &s;at my&s;elf down in a lodging near town, they &s;hould report that I had gone abroad, which would make it a better thing for them, at it would enhance the va|lue of tho&s;e things I might furni&s;h them with. Finding they &s;hould have my exclu&s;ive labours, they gave into every thing; and I mu&s;t, in ju&s;tice, declare that having al|ready given me about the fourth of what I ought to have been paid, they did not &s;o far take advantage of my pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;i|ties as to beat me down in any one article I offered them; and during the time I
<PB N="118" REF="122">
&s;tayed in England, nothing could be more &s;acredly kept than was my &s;ecret.</P>
<P>Nay, they did every thing they could &s;ecretly to get at Hewit, with a view to expo&s;tulate with him, and the good woman, who certainly had a mo&s;t excellent opinion of me, for, &s;aid &s;he, 'indu&s;trous people are never bad,' a&s;&s;ured me, if &s;he could find him, &s;he would have his life out if he did not do me ju&s;tice, adding, 'fine airs indeed, ju&s;t like my hu&s;band once when we had a hand&s;ome apprentice; but I made him buckle to, I &s;oon brought his no&s;e to the grind&s;tone!' All they could do, however, was of no u&s;e, for the Van|&s;itart, which was the la&s;t &s;hip of that &s;ea&s;on, from whence he dated his letter, had &s;ailed before they could make any enquiries, and it being now &s;ix months before another fleet was to go out, I had no chance of following him even had I ability to do &s;o.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. Morris approved very
<PB N="119" REF="123">
much of my de&s;ign of breaking off with Mrs. Vint, &s;aying, which I have no doubt was nothing but &s;candal, that they had heard but a &s;o &s;oi&s;h character of her. I had now taken a lodging at Brumpton, and I earned of Mr. Morris about fifty &s;hillings a week, more than half of which I regularly &s;aved to lay up again&s;t a rainy day.</P>
<P>I had continued in this &s;ituation about three months, when, one morning, having taken up a new&s;paper, I found to my great a&s;toni&s;hment, that my brother, the lawyer, was condemned to death for for|gery; and that Sourby, as his accomplice, though not, on account of &s;ome law nicety, implicated capitally, was &s;entenced to be tran&s;ported for life.</P>
<P>This &s;ickened me of my native coun|try; and when I reflected that Hewit was gone to India, where both he and my bro|ther
<PB N="120" REF="124">
had often pre&s;&s;ed me to try my for|tune, though I never thought of the &s;ub|ject but I turned as cold as ice, and the &s;weat ran off my forehead, I almo&s;t made up my mind to embark with the next fleet, upon this idea, that if I found Hewit, and could appea&s;e his cau&s;ele&s;s anger, I might yet be happy with him; if not, I &s;hould be &s;ure to meet with a brother, the only friend on earth able and willing to defend me, and a &s;on, who might, in duty, com|pen&s;ate for his father's cruelty and neglect.</P>
<P>While I was wavering on this &s;ubject, like one wi&s;hing to plunge into a &s;alutary bath yet afraid of being drowned, my beautiful little girl, and heaven knows Hewit's beautiful little girl, the only ve&s;tige of him now left me, fir&s;t &s;ickened and &s;oon after died. I now grew &s;o me|lancholy, &s;o &s;ick of di&s;appointment, &s;o heart broken, and &s;o completely let down, that I was ready to follow to, whenever
<PB N="121" REF="125">
Fate &s;hould think proper to beckon. To be brief, I immediately adverti&s;ed as a companion to any lady of fortune going to India; and having given a reference to Mr. Morris, who gave me a mo&s;t ex|cellent character, I &s;ailed in the &s;pring of the year, 1781, and arrived, in &s;omething le&s;s than eight months, at my brother's hou&s;e in Surat.</P>
<P>He happened to be ju&s;t arrived from a long voyage; and after a mo&s;t affecti|onate welcome, which, unu&s;ed as I was to kindne&s;s, overcame me with delight and melted me into gratitude, I &s;oon learnt that he knew my affairs as well as I knew them my&s;elf. He &s;hewed me three letters from Hewit, which, though dated and &s;ent at different times, he had received all together.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e letters, in a mo&s;t manly manner, delicately and feelingly
<PB N="122" REF="126">
opened my &s;uppo&s;ed ill conduct; appealed to him how I ought to be treated; ac|knowledged he was broken hearted, and that he never &s;hould have taken the re&s;o|lution to part with me but from the fulle&s;t conviction, and the dread of what his vio|lent love might have hurried him to. He fini&s;hed with &s;aying, he &s;hould imme|diately fly to him, as the only friend with whom he could expect to find con&s;o|lation in &s;uch a delicate and wretched &s;ituation.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd letter, he informed my brother that he had mi&s;&s;ed of the Van|&s;itart. Mi&s;&s;ed of her, &s;aid I, then if I had been indu&s;trious I might have found him out and convinced him of his errors. The letter went on &s;aying, that he was confirmed in his former &s;u&s;picions, for that he had &s;carcely turned his back when I went off publickly with Binns, and that I was, at that time, living with him in
<PB N="123" REF="127">
Ireland. That he had &s;ent that letter by the Packet, and he &s;hould po&s;itively em|bark him&s;elf by the next fleet.</P>
<P>The third letter contradicted the other two. He &s;aid my brother, the lawyer, had &s;ent for him when he was under &s;en|tence of death, in Newgate, and had lain open a mo&s;t iniquitous &s;cene of villainy. He was now convinced I was perfectly innocent, and he had laboured in every po&s;&s;ible way to find me out, and make me amends; and among the re&s;t, had in|&s;erted &s;everal adverti&s;ements in the new&s;|papers, drawn up in the mo&s;t penitent and contrite terms. He &s;aid, this letter was written in a hurry, but that he &s;hould write again fully as &s;oon as he &s;hould get any intelligence; and as he had al|ready learnt that I was in an ob&s;cure lodging &s;omewhere near town, he had no doubt of &s;ending in his next the &s;a|tisfactory
<PB N="124" REF="128">
intelligence of having found, and being reconciled, to the mo&s;t amiable and mo&s;t injured of wives.</P>
<P>I was all anxiety now to get back. 'Ava&s;t, ava&s;t!' &s;aid my brother, 'we mu&s;t talk this matter over cooly. To be &s;ure if he &s;hould hear of your taking this trip, and follow you, it would be awkward enough; but even then it is but a trip home again at wor&s;t, and Jack Hewit does not mind a little weather.</P>
<P>'I will tell you how it is with me; I mu&s;t &s;ail in a fortnight for the Coa&s;t of Coromandel with a freight, and after that I am going upon a commi&s;&s;ion from the Nabob, acro&s;s the Red Sea, to Grand Cairo, which, I think, is the la&s;t voyage I &s;hall make; for, thank God, good friends, and my own indu&s;try, I am now grown pretty warm. If, therefore, you have a mind to tru&s;t your&s;elf with me, I
<PB N="125" REF="129">
have no doubt but, either on our way, at Madra&s;s, or &s;ome other port, I can put you on board an Indiaman bound for Europe. If not, and you &s;hould think it more fea&s;ible to &s;tay, here are my premi&s;es, hou&s;e, la&s;cars, palanquin, every thing at your &s;ervice, till either my return, which, by the way, will be three years, or the ar|rival of Hewit.</P>
<P>I expre&s;&s;ed a very ardent wi&s;h to &s;ee my &s;on, but this he told me was impo&s;&s;i|ble; for that he was &s;ituated in a very good employ at Benares, and that we &s;hould not be, at any time, within five hundred miles of him. He a&s;&s;ured me he was perfectly well, was very much re|&s;pected, and in a way to get rich; I, there|fore, contented my&s;elf with writing him a long letter full of maternal tenderne&s;s, and containing advice &s;uitable to his time of life, tending to en&s;ure his happine&s;s, and accelerate his expectations.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="130">
Upon deliberate con&s;ideration, it was agreed that I &s;hould return; and, with this idea, I embarked on board my bro|ther's &s;hip. Our voyage was adver&s;e, and we were driven into Tricomalee ju&s;t as the Gro&s;venor was preparing to &s;ail. My brother happening to know captain Cox&s;on, her commander, perfectly well, he took me aboard with great willingne&s;s, and promi&s;ed me every po&s;&s;ible accommo|dation.</P>
<P>We dined on board, and a fair wind &s;pringing up, we &s;ailed the next day. I bur&s;t into a flood of tears at parting with my brother, which he treated as a joke. 'Good bye, Hannah,' &s;aid he, 'I am go|ing over the Red Sea to &s;earch for the &s;pirits that are laid there; And if I &s;hould fi&s;h up one of the wheels of Pharoah's chariot, with the fluke of my anchor, I'll &s;end it for a pre&s;ent to &s;ome of the gaming-hou&s;es near St. James's.'</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="131">
In &s;hort, after &s;ettling all matters, as to Hewit and every thing el&s;e, we parted. He, in the highe&s;t good humour, and I, in the mo&s;t pitiable depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits, which continued from that day, the 13th of June, till the 4th of Augu&s;t, when the Gro&s;venor was &s;hipwrecked, between la|titude 27 and 32, on the Coa&s;t of Africa.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. SOME ACCOUNT OF THE DREADFUL DISTRESS EX|PERIENCED BY THE PASSENGERS AND CREW OF THE GROSVENOR EAST-INDIAMAN.</HEAD>
<P>THE moment the &s;hip &s;truck, a univer&s;al panic pervaded the whole company as if conveyed by an electrical &s;hock. That
<PB N="130" REF="133">
fatal blow was the knell of many, perhaps of all there, except me; or, if any &s;ur|vived, if they encountered &s;o many hard|&s;hips as I did, unle&s;s their minds were as well fitted to the trial, better, indeed, had it been for them to have died at that moment.</P>
<P>In the confu&s;ion, as it is u&s;ual I &s;up|po&s;e upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, every precau|tion was taken improperly. The carpen|ters attempted to &s;ound the pumps, when it was impo&s;&s;ible to find water; which had run entirely forward, owing to the &s;tern's lying high upon the rocks. Signals of di&s;tre&s;s were next ordered to be fired; but had common &s;en&s;e been con&s;ulted, they would have known, that owing to the wa|ter, they could not get to the powder-room.</P>
<P>In this delemma what &s;hould have been done fir&s;t was done la&s;t, but not till the experiment was ineffectual. I mean
<PB N="131" REF="134">
cutting away the ma&s;ts, which expedient had it been adopted before the ve&s;&s;el had &s;truck &s;o hard and &s;o often by the &s;tern as to wedge her&s;elf, as it were, among the rocks, the wind now coming to blow off the land, &s;he would certainly have righted, though, perhaps, with con&s;iderable da|mage.</P>
<P>Every precaution, finding all other hope at an end, was now taken to convey the crew and the pa&s;&s;engers a&s;hore. A raft was formed and launched, but it proved as ineffectual an attempt as the re&s;t, for the haw&s;er, to which it was fa&s;tened, broke and five men were drowned.</P>
<P>Four expert &s;ailors now attempted to &s;wim a&s;hore, conducting with them the deep &s;ea line, with a view to convey a larger line, and then a larger &s;till, in order that the people might be borne upon it, &s;o as to reach the &s;hore in &s;afety.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="135">
Another expedient was to hoi&s;t out the yawl, and the jolly boat, but this an|&s;wered no better purpo&s;e than any of the former, for the &s;urf curling in between the pointed fragments of the rocks, in&s;tantly da&s;hed them both to pieces.</P>
<P>But none of the&s;e methods could ap|ply to the &s;afety of any others than expert &s;ailors; the pa&s;&s;engers, and particularly the ladies, mu&s;t inevitably have peri&s;hed, had it not been for a mo&s;t unexpected and pro|vidental circum&s;tance, by means of which every &s;oul that then remained got on &s;hore without the &s;malle&s;t difficulty.</P>
<P>The wind chopping directly about, and blowing right on the &s;hore, the bows, which were loo&s;e from the rock, being heavy and choaked with water, &s;trained con&s;iderably, and the ve&s;&s;el, having nearly broken her back, &s;he fairly &s;napt in two immediately before the main ma&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="136">
The after part, having le&s;s to &s;trug|gle with, and being, of cour&s;e, con&s;i|derably lighter, in con&s;equence of be|ing di&s;encumbered of the bows, began, by the force of the wind, and the un|dulating motion of the &s;urge, which made to the land, to be lifted forwards. Strik|ing, however, frequently, as this part of wreck edged in, a &s;evere &s;hock tore the deck fairly a&s;under, by which means, as on a raft, that part neare&s;t the &s;hore floated into &s;hoal water, and every crea|ture, except, I believe, about four, were &s;aved.</P>
<P>We had every pro&s;pect that the &s;hore, where we had taken &s;helter, would not prove a very ho&s;pitable one, for the inha|bitants con&s;tantly plundered us, and when we re&s;i&s;ted, beat us. My foreboding heart, which always too fatally anticipated my &s;ufferings, had, in the mid&s;t of my di&s;traction, providently dictated to me to
<PB N="134" REF="137">
&s;upply my&s;elf with whatever might be u&s;e|ful to me in any emergency. I had, there|fore, carefully concealed about me two knives, two pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ars, a hou&s;ewife, very well &s;tocked, pins, and a few other things; and having, be&s;ides, made a parade of buckles, ear-rings, and other trinkets, they contented them&s;elves with plunder|ing me of what was vi&s;ible, and left my concealed &s;tock unmolle&s;ted.</P>
<P>We remained a long time undeter|mined, as to what mea&s;ures we &s;hould pur&s;ue; but, after a variety of con&s;ulta|tions, we re&s;olved to traver&s;e the country, in hopes, at length, to fall in with &s;ome of the Dutch &s;ettlements.</P>
<P>This attempt was attended with various &s;ucce&s;s. We pa&s;&s;ed, at fir&s;t, from village to village, with but little difficulty; but as we advanced our troubles increa&s;ed. The natives plundered us, and if we ap|proached
<PB N="135" REF="138">
the woods, we were terrified, not only with the roarings, but the &s;ight of wild bea&s;ts; and, in &s;hort, &s;urrounded with &s;o many, and &s;uch complicated difficulties, and inconveniencies, that though they were little to tho&s;e I have &s;u&s;tained &s;ince, my heart &s;inks within me at the remem|brance of them.</P>
<P>At length our misfortunes ma&s;tered our patience; and in&s;tead of enduring with re&s;ignation what could not be avoided, we inveighed again&s;t each other for the fruit|le&s;s advice every one had given. The &s;ailors &s;wore that if it had not been for the ob&s;tancy of the captain, in not taking pro|per ob&s;ervations, the &s;hip would never have gone a&s;hore. Some advi&s;ed going back to the wreck, others to live in the be&s;t manner we could, while a party of the mo&s;t enterpri&s;ing &s;hould go forward and give notice to the Dutch &s;ettlers; who, in hopes of a reward from the En|gli&s;h
<PB N="136" REF="139">
Ea&s;t-India Company, would of cour&s;e &s;end to our relief.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;contents were augmented by their receiving information from a man, &s;uppo&s;ed to be a Malayan, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to accompli&s;h what they attempted. This man, who called him|&s;elf Trout, met us two or three times, and &s;eemed very anxious as to what was to become of us. I had noticed him very little my&s;elf, though it is plain I had not e&s;caped his ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>He was repre&s;ented as a man who had been guilty of &s;everal murders in his own country, and had, therefore, taken &s;helter among the Caffres, where he was &s;ettled and had a wife and a child. This alone was quite enough to deter me from pay|ing him much attention, but his &s;allow face, his lank black hair, and his wild looks, in which there was an uncommon
<PB N="137" REF="140">
ferocity, perfectly di&s;gu&s;ted me; though I could not help thinking I had &s;ome|where &s;een a re&s;emblance of him; and, notwith&s;tanding, he &s;poke Dutch, which language I did not under&s;tand, I imagined I had at &s;ometime or other heard his voice.</P>
<P>This man having widened the unhappy breach among us, in a few days it was re|&s;olved, that the captain's party &s;hould take one route, and the re&s;t another. The mates, the &s;urgeon, the pa&s;&s;engers, and in &s;hort, all the genteeler part of the com|pany made their election to &s;tay with the captain, and what became of the re&s;t I am entirely ignorant of; and, indeed, of tho&s;e, except one with whom I was left, for it was my fate, though, perhaps, my life was pre&s;erved by it, to be torne from my com|panions &s;hortly afterwards in the manner I &s;hall relate in its place.</P>
<P>The man who called him&s;elf Trout,
<PB N="138" REF="141">
had met us three &s;everal times. What pa&s;&s;ed at the&s;e meetings the ladies knew nothing of but by report, for we were now &s;o bare of nece&s;&s;aries, that it was &s;carcely decent for us to be &s;een. We, therefore, walked at a di&s;tance from the men; and when they found any refre&s;h|ment, they left it and we went and fetched it when they were out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>When night concealed our &s;hame, we conver&s;ed together; and at tho&s;e opportu|nities, we learnt that this man had come to treat with us from the natives, who &s;aid, that if we would &s;ubmit to be their &s;er|vants, till we were redeemed by the Dutch, they would &s;end an expre&s;s to the &s;ettlers de&s;cribing our &s;ituation, and in|forming them of our quality, after which we &s;hould be delivered whenever we were demanded; and, in the mean time, we &s;hould experience very mild and kind treatment.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="142">
We journeyed on in the track we were directed, but heard no more of the negociation. One morning we mi&s;&s;ed one of the carpenter's mates, who&s;e name was M'Daniel, and as we had heard the roaring of wild bea&s;ts in the night, we conjectured he had been carried off and torne to pieces.</P>
<P>Our di&s;tre&s;&s;es and apprehen&s;ions now hourly encrea&s;ed. Treachery from the na|tives, de&s;truction from fami&s;hed wolves, lions, and tygers; raging hunger we could not appea&s;e, and parching thir&s;t, which we were obliged to allay in the mo&s;t &s;hocking and unnatural manner, menaced us in &s;uch horrid and various forms, that we &s;eemed like &s;o many devoted wretches waiting for death as the only kind friend we could implore to terminate our &s;hock|ing and degrading mi&s;eries.</P>
<P>Surely, &s;urely human nature never
<PB N="140" REF="143">
&s;uffered &s;uch deplorable humiliation. A &s;et of fine, &s;en&s;ible, gallant men, and hand&s;ome, elegant, educated women, reduced to a &s;tate more filthy than brutes. Their re&s;olution conquered, their intellects impaired, their &s;trength exhau&s;ted, their hopes de&s;troyed. In the cour&s;e of a few days &s;hrunk, de|cayed, and emaciated; all loveline&s;s de|faced, all delicacy confounded. For this, thought I, did we &s;eek the volup|tuous luxury of the Ea&s;t? For this in our &s;loating palace did we command the winds to waft us with propitious gales to our expecting friends? But it is ju&s;t. Inordinate plea&s;ure terminates in pain, and extravagant hope is baulked by di&s;|appointment.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ay, however, that my ob|&s;ervation exactly applied to my&s;elf. In going to India, I had no pride to gra|tify; no &s;plendor to indulge in; nor

did I contemplate the &s;atisfaction I &s;hould receive on my return, at being gazed on as a meteor, and held up as a prodigy of beauty, wit, and elegance though the glaring medium of a galaxy of diamonds.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP II. HANNAH PARTS FOR EVER FROM HER COMPANIONS IN AFFLICTION; THE CAUSE OF THIS EXTRA|ORDINARY SEPARATION; SOME CURIOUS PARTI|CULARS RELATIVE TO TROUT; AND AN AWFUL INSTANCE OF THE JUSTICE OF PROVIDENCE.</HEAD>
<P>I Do not mean, in my la&s;t ob&s;ervations, to ca&s;t any reflections on my unhappy companions. The moment of wretched|ne&s;s is but an ill time for the language of admonition; and if it were a proper one, never was it &s;o little nece&s;&s;ary as upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. I declare my heart bleeds within me when I think of the probable fate of &s;uch ornaments of their &s;ex as Mrs. James, Mi&s;s Ho&s;ea,
<PB N="143" REF="146">
Mi&s;s Wilmot, Mi&s;s Dennis, and other la|dies, who had the misfortune to be &s;hip|wrecked in the Gro&s;venor.</P>
<P>I only meant to remark, that the&s;e la|dies having fallen from a greater height than I did, and their di&s;appointment, as to their future pro&s;pects, being more elevated than mine, neither my mind was &s;o con|quered, nor my body &s;o impaired as theirs. Indeed, if I could not account for it, the &s;uperior health, and, I almo&s;t &s;aid, &s;pirits I was in, would not be credited; but as it is my di&s;po&s;ition, upon all occa|&s;ions, to be provident, &s;o the precautions I adopted, from the fir&s;t moment of com|ing a&s;hore, &s;erved to prepare me for all I was to &s;uffer.</P>
<P>The&s;e precautions I could not prevail on any body el&s;e to take. If there was any thing to eat, they would eat vora|ciou&s;ly. If what we had was merely a re|&s;ource, it was de&s;pi&s;ed. Thus by &s;ucking
<PB N="144" REF="147">
gums, chewing the pith of a tree, ex|tracting juice from leaves, keeping perpe|tually a &s;tone in my mouth, e&s;pecially if it contained any &s;aline or nutritious quality, were very &s;alutary re&s;ources to me, though for a long time I could not prevail on them to follow my example, and when they wi&s;hed to have followed it, we were in too dreary a part of the country to find the means.</P>
<P>I was as unfortunate in the re&s;ource I had provided, by hoarding up a little &s;tock of nece&s;&s;aries. When we came to be in great extremity, I &s;hared it with them to the la&s;t article; but they were &s;o carele&s;s, or rather &s;o lo&s;t, in con&s;equence of their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, that the inhabitants with ea&s;e di&s;covered their hoard and plundered them, &s;o that all that remained of it was what I had now left in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, con&s;i&s;ting of a kni&s;e, and a pinca&s;e, with &s;ome pins, which &s;erve me to reckon the days.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="148">
I here mention the&s;e matters in &s;ome order, becau&s;e it was on the next day, be|ing the 2d of October, 1782, and exactly eight weeks and three days after the &s;hip &s;truck, that I was torne from my com|panions in misfortune, never to &s;ee them more.</P>
<P>The men came to us towards &s;un &s;et, and told us they had &s;een Trout, who &s;aid he &s;hould be ready for the negociation the next morning, and bid us &s;ing for joy. We, therefore, all determined to yield to the propo&s;als of the Caffres, provided they involved no actual violation of our honour, in which ca&s;e, it is but little to &s;ay, that we would rather have &s;acrificed our lives than have con&s;ented.</P>
<P>And now a number of melancholy re|flections &s;unk our &s;pirits to the du&s;t; and as we laid down to re&s;t, we compared our|&s;elves to the children of I&s;rael in captivity,
<PB N="146" REF="149">
commanded to &s;ing the Lord's &s;ong in a &s;trange land. Indeed, no moment of my life will ever have a more indelible place in my remembrance, than that night. Overcome with fatigue, &s;unk into melan|choly, and our minds &s;oftened into a fixed &s;adne&s;s that weighed upon our hearts, every one heightened the de&s;pondency of the pre&s;ent moment by the recollection of &s;ome happier time, when the &s;miles of fortune had not a &s;ingle film to ob&s;truct them.</P>
<P>It was within three hours of morning; and, it being my turn to relate &s;ome &s;ad pa&s;&s;age of my life, I had &s;carcely in|veighed again&s;t the treachery of a fal&s;e friend, the ea&s;y credulity of a jealous mi&s;taken hu&s;band, and deplored the lo&s;s of a lovely infant, when, all of a &s;udden, two Caffres ru&s;hed upon us, tore me away from my companions, and folding me up in a &s;ort of wrapper, darted with me acro&s;s the &s;and. Whether my cries
<PB N="147" REF="150">
were &s;o &s;mothered as not to be heard, or whether my companions took a fal&s;e di|rection in any attempt to re&s;cue me from the&s;e wretches I know not, but it was a con&s;iderable time before they &s;topped, and when they did, I was delivered into the power of Trout, who gue&s;s my di&s;|traction, announced him&s;elf as the villain&mdash;Sourby!</P>
<P>Oh heavens what did I feel at this mo|ment! No wonder I had &s;huddered every time I had &s;een the wretch, though always at a di&s;tance, no wonder his per&s;on and voice, di&s;gui&s;ed as they were, &s;eemed fa|miliar to me; no wonder, in &s;hort, I &s;hould apprehend the wor&s;t of perdition, when &s;o malignant a fiend was hovering round me.</P>
<P>His companions had &s;carcely &s;et me down, when after exchanging a few words with him, in a language I did not under|&s;tand,
<PB N="148" REF="151">
they di&s;appeared like lightning. I began to tear the air with my cries, but he entreated me not to be alarmed, &s;aid that the moments were precious, and it would be my fault if he made an improper u&s;e of them.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, that the law having taken hold of him in England, he had determined from that moment to repent and become a valuable member of any country on which he &s;hould happen to be thrown. That the captain of the tran&s;port &s;hip, had &s;o well liked his behaviour, that he had put him on board a ve&s;&s;el bound to the Brazils, with a recommendation to a merchant there.</P>
<P>This merchant finding him very capa|ble of conducting bu&s;ine&s;s, had entru&s;ted him with &s;everal commi&s;&s;ions to the Cape of Good Hope, where he was going on very pro&s;perou&s;ly, and would have made a fortune, but for an extraordinary acci|dent,
<PB N="149" REF="152">
which he was &s;orry it fell to his lot to relate, becau&s;e it nearly concerned me. 'Me!' cried I, "Yes, you," &s;aid he, "but be not alarmed, your hu&s;band is no more; and finding you in this inho&s;pitable place, I entreat that I may be your pro|tector in his &s;tead."</P>
<P>'My hu&s;band dead!' &s;aid I, "Yes," an&s;wered he, "but I revenged him. I put the Dutch villain to death with my own hand, who had dared to lift his again&s;t my friend!"</P>
<P>There &s;eemed &s;o much rhodomontade in this that I could not for my life give credit to it; I di&s;embled, however, and with a deep &s;igh, the offspring of involun|tary fear, enquired into the particulars, when I learnt that he had found John Hewit in a fray at the Cape, where a Dutchman had &s;tabbed him with a &s;nick|a&s;nee; that he him&s;elf, as he informed me before, had immediataly put the Dutch|man
<PB N="150" REF="153">
to death, who being a man of &s;ome con&s;ideration, he was obliged to fly; that &s;ince that time, he had lived among&s;t the Caffres, who would not admit him till he had taken a wife from their tribe, that he had dete&s;ted the life he led, that from the moment he &s;aw me, for he knew me im|mediately, he had meditated my e&s;cape, which it was now in his power to effect.</P>
<P>He added, that he had entirely amended his life, that I knew very well that he never loved any woman but me, that he did not con&s;ider his marriage among the Caffres as any way binding, and that if I would e&s;cape with him to Madaga&s;car, where he had no doubt but we &s;hould get very &s;afe, he would there marry me, and called Heaven to witne&s;s that if I would tru&s;t my&s;elf in his care, no violence &s;hould be offered to me. He then fini&s;hed by appealing to me, whether in gratitude I ought not to marry the man who had avenged the death of my hu&s;band.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="154">
The morning now dawned; and as the day in tho&s;e countries comes on very fa&s;t, I de&s;erned, by the &s;ea &s;hore, a man waiting with a kind of &s;hallop. I con&s;i|dered in a moment, that I &s;hould be &s;afer in the company of two men, even though they &s;hould be both villains, than with one. I knew it mu&s;t be deep di&s;&s;imulation that could impo&s;e upon Sourby, yet I was de|termined to di&s;&s;emble.</P>
<P>I told him that liberty, nay, even life it&s;elf, was, at that time, of very little mo|ment to me; and even if from moral, or religious motives, I could wi&s;h to pre&s;erve either, what could I po&s;&s;ibly hope from him who had made it his uniform pretence to deceive and impo&s;e upon me.</P>
<P>He declared he liked me the better for dete&s;ting his former character, but he was now no longer that character, his in|tentions were honourable; and in what|ever he might be found deficient, he
<PB N="152" REF="155">
&s;hould con&s;ider it the pride of his life to be corrected by my better mind, and &s;u|perior judgment.</P>
<P>This affected compliment, to my &s;a|gacity, by which he thought to impo&s;e upon me, was not thrown away. I put that &s;agacity in practice in a moment; and, penetrating his heart and intentions, though I found him a greater villain than ever, I determined, guarded as I was, to ri&s;k every thing for my liberty. I, there|fore, reluctantly appeared to con&s;ent, a&s;&s;igning &s;uch motives as would be mo&s;t likely to impo&s;e upon him; and now as we walked towards the boat, my wrapper &s;till round me, which proved to be a morning gown belonging to poor captain Cox&s;on; I enquired what men were tho&s;e who carried me off, and where they were gone.</P>
<P>He told me that my que&s;tion involved the fate of all my companions, the nature
<PB N="153" REF="156">
of which he would inform me. They were all that morning to be &s;urrounded and taken pri&s;oners, after which a propo&s;al would be made for the men to take Caffre wives, and the women Caffre hu&s;bands, which if any refu&s;ed to do, they would be killed and eaten. That he had with great difficulty kept this bu&s;ine&s;s in a &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion for the la&s;t three weeks, which time he had employed in getting ready the &s;hallop, and &s;tocking it with provi&s;ions; that having de&s;paired of getting me away by fair means, he had employed force; and that the two Caffres, which people are always faithful when they were em|ployed, but vindictive if deceived, had undertaken to effect this upon promi&s;e of being rewarded.</P>
<P>The reward he had promi&s;ed the Caffres was three buffaloes, and five deer; which, at parting, he had given them orders to drive to their own kraal,
<PB N="154" REF="157">
but they would find, he &s;aid, no &s;uch buffaloes, nor deer, for he had been obliged to part with them to another Caffre, to procure a part of our &s;upply; therefore, &s;aid he, you &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing expedition, for if the&s;e men &s;hould find out the deceit and return before we get away, I &s;hall become a &s;acrifice. Nay, this may &s;erve to convince you of my &s;incerity, for if cruelly you now refu&s;e my forfeit life will &s;oon expiate my for|mer crimes.</P>
<P>Though I &s;aw the villain in every word of this, I affected to believe him; and ap|pearing plea&s;ed at this in&s;tance of his &s;eem|ing confidence, I &s;ignified &s;ome anxiety about getting away. In a very &s;hort time we got to the &s;hallop, which I found guarded by the very carpenter's mate whom we had given over as one devoured by wild bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>As this young man had demeaned him&s;elf
<PB N="155" REF="158">
with great propriety and decorum, I took heart at the &s;ight of him; but what was my &s;urprize when he caught an opportunity of whi&s;pering to me, when Sourby was fetching &s;ome things at a di&s;tance, "You are in the hands of a villain; &s;eem to tru&s;t him by all means. If he behaves ill, I know how to defend you."</P>
<P>Sourby had told me not to contradict him in any thing he &s;hould &s;ay as to the motives of our intended voyage. He &s;aid, he had amu&s;ed this young man with the promi&s;e of mountains when we &s;hould reach Madaga&s;car, where he pretended I had a very rich brother. In con&s;equence of the&s;e and other promi&s;es, he had, from the wreck of the Gro&s;venor, formed this &s;hallop, which was well built, both for &s;urfs and &s;eas, and plentifully &s;tored, &s;o that there could be no doubt but we &s;hould e&s;cape in &s;afety.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="159">
Placing an implicit tru&s;t in provi|dence, I &s;uffered myfelf to be conducted on board. The weather was uncommonly &s;erene and beautiful; and &s;ailing under favour of an awning that protected us from the &s;corching rays of the &s;un, we went be|fore the wind under a kind of &s;quare &s;ail, at &s;o expeditious a rate, that in about four hours we lo&s;t &s;ight of the African coa&s;t.</P>
<P>My mind was &s;o fully made up to all con&s;equences, and I knew &s;o well the na|ture of every ri&s;k I could po&s;&s;ibly run; that having plenty of provi&s;ions, and very comfortable things to wrap my&s;elf in, by way of temporary cloathing, I felt as if in&s;pired with new life, I &s;tipulated for a partition to be made for me abaft, where I might retire as often and as long as I plea&s;ed, e&s;pecially when I might be in|clined to &s;leep, and that every attention &s;hould be &s;trictly kept, which delicacy and decorum demanded.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="160">
The&s;e conditions were inviolably ob|&s;erved; and for &s;ix days, during which time we kept the &s;ea, the weather being &s;till, mild, and favourable, I cannot &s;ay I had any thing to complain of. Sourby appeared to pay me great deference and re&s;pect, con&s;tantly alluding to the acknow|ledgements he &s;hould receive from my brother, when he &s;hould have &s;afely de|livered me into his hands, and the carpen|ter's mate &s;eemed very thankful for the promi&s;es that were made him in return for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he was affording us. As to the re&s;t, the fate of my afflicted friends on the coa&s;t of Africa, was often the &s;ub|ject of our conver&s;ation; and we com|forted our&s;elves with the hope of &s;ending a&s;&s;i&s;tance to them from Madaga&s;car, in which hope we were none of us &s;incere, for we mu&s;t have known no &s;uch thing was practicable.</P>
<P>In proportion as conver&s;ation becomes familiar, nothing is &s;o ea&s;y as to catch peo|ple
<PB N="158" REF="161">
tripping. Cunning as he was, this was often the ca&s;e with Sourby, but much oftener with the carpenter's mate, who was more artle&s;s; nay, I will not &s;ay it did not &s;ometimes happen to me. Thus getting equally di&s;tru&s;tful, we grew grave, re&s;erved, and cautious. As for my&s;elf, confiding in nothing but my firm and unalterable re|&s;olution, I was prepared for any act, how|ever de&s;perate, to free me from impending danger; and for the men, a thou&s;and half hints and &s;ignificant ge&s;tures convinced me that they were bent on each other's de|&s;truction.</P>
<P>On the &s;eventh day this moodine&s;s rather encrea&s;ed than dimini&s;hed. While we were venturing every po&s;&s;ible con|jecture, as to our &s;ituation, and di&s;puting about it pretty warmly all round, we plainly &s;aw land; and the wind &s;etting fair for the &s;hore, we made towards it pretty fa&s;t. This di&s;covery was for ten minutes a &s;ubject of general exultation. Pre&s;ently
<PB N="159" REF="162">
we had all our different meditations on it. At la&s;t it threw &s;uch a gloom over us, as each bo&s;om throbbed with its own con|&s;lict, that it mu&s;t have been pitable to have &s;een us.</P>
<P>I have thought an hundred times what a dreadful degradation of humanity this &s;cene pre&s;ented. That three beings who dared to tempt the dangerous ocean with &s;o in&s;ignificant a protection, who had found in providence a generous &s;afeguard, and an unering pilot; in&s;tead of exulting at this unexampled &s;alvation, in&s;tead of vowing to devote them&s;elves to the pro|tection of each other, &s;hould indulge in nothing but criminal and unfeeling &s;elf|i&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>My conduct, however, Heaven knows, had an innocent motive; for I began to fear both my conductors, and had no doubt, when once a&s;hore, when one
<PB N="160" REF="163">
&s;hould have killed the other in rival con|tention, my honour was to be the prize of the victor.</P>
<P>I had not long, however, to think upon this before we &s;aw a mon&s;trous &s;hark making towards us; at which mo|ment, whether it was his previous in|tention, or whether his conduct aro&s;e from an in&s;tantaneous impul&s;e on &s;eeing the &s;hark, I knew not; but Sourby &s;eized a kind of pole ax, and aimed it at the head of the carpenter's mate.</P>
<P>I &s;creamed and catched at his arm, but not &s;o effectually as wholly to prevent the blow, which, however, fell obliquely on the poor man's &s;tomach in&s;tead of his head; when, mark the finger of providence! My intervention diverting the arm of Sourby from the direction he intended it &s;hould take, and, by that means, throwing his body out of its equipoi&s;e, unable to re|cover
<PB N="161" REF="164">
his feet, he &s;taggered from the thwart, on which he had &s;tood, and fell into the &s;ea.</P>
<P>My cries were now reiterated, I en|treated he might be &s;aved, whatever might be the con&s;equence. He implored, in Chri&s;t's name, we would a&s;&s;i&s;t him, de|claring him&s;elf to have been the wor&s;t of all villains, but that he would amend his life. The poor carpenter's mate, though almo&s;t lifele&s;s, &s;econded my en|deavours, but in vain, for before we could get him into the boat, he uttered, incoherently, 'Binns! Hewit!' Then gave a frightful &s;cream, and was nipt in two by the mon&s;ter.</P>
<P>If ever unerring ju&s;tice gave an aw|ful example in the death of any man, it did in the death of this. He had been a &s;hark to his fellow creatures. Peace of mind, dome&s;tic felicity, character, ho|nour,
<PB N="162" REF="165">
loveline&s;s, innocence, had all been a prey to his in&s;atiate rapacity; and now, Oh matchle&s;s in&s;tance of impartial reta|liation! he him&s;elf became a prey to the mercile&s;s mon&s;ter, who&s;e remor&s;ele&s;s vo|racity had been his imitation.</P>

and fell backwards; &s;eeing, therefore, I had nothing el&s;e for it, I exerted all my re&s;olution. I &s;pread the &s;prit acro&s;s the &s;ail, put the head of the &s;hallop right for the &s;hore; and the wind and tide &s;etting in, I dare &s;ay it was not more than half an hour when we were &s;carcely afloat upon an even &s;and as fair and as firm as the beach at the foot of Portland I&s;land.</P>
<P>I cheered my companion in the be&s;t manner I could, leading him with great difficulty up a gradual eminence, where he might &s;it down in &s;helter from the flowing tide, and re&s;t him&s;elf more at his ea&s;e than in the boat. I then fetched him every refre&s;hment I could find; and fear|ing le&s;t night &s;hould &s;urprize me, I moored the &s;hallop in the be&s;t manner my &s;trength would permit, and returned to the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of M'Daniel, who I yet hoped, with care and attention, would recover.</P>
<P>I was deceived, he grew fainter and
<PB N="165" REF="168">
fainter, and &s;o far from being able to eat, he could &s;carcely &s;peak. However, in broken &s;entences, he told me that Sourby had deluded him from the company under a promi&s;e that he &s;hould regain his liberty, and make his fortune by means of a gentle|man at Madaga&s;car; that he had believed his &s;tory, and was willing enough to ad|venture in his &s;cheme; but upon being told that this gentleman's name was Hig|gins, a doubt had ari&s;en in his mind, for that he knew captain Higgins, had &s;erved under him, and had a great value for him; and al&s;o knew that he, at that time, which was the truth, was &s;ettled comfortably in India, for he had &s;een him when he put me on board the Gro&s;venor.</P>
<P>This doubt had induced him to put other circum&s;tances together, and, upon the whole, he had no doubt but Sourby's intention was to &s;teal me away with &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter de&s;ign. Still it was his advice that I &s;hould attempt my e&s;cape, as he &s;hould
<PB N="166" REF="169">
be at hand to protect me, if it became ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and to this he added, that he had him&s;elf conceived a violent pa&s;&s;ion for me from the fir&s;t moment he &s;aw me, but un|der&s;tanding I was a married woman, had checked it. Believing now, however, that I was &s;ingle, it was his intention fir&s;t to have de&s;erved my affection, and then to have offered his.</P>
<P>All this, in a very incoherent, di&s;|jointed manner, I got from M'Daniel, who added, that if out of his death &s;hould come my pre&s;ervation, he &s;hould heave his la&s;t &s;igh with plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>I omitted nothing that could cheri&s;h and comfort him, I tenderly entreated him to take heart, telling him, that though he could never be my hu&s;band, he &s;hould be my protector and my friend. He &s;carcely now heard me, life was for&s;aking him, his re&s;piration was thick, broken, and con|vul&s;ed; at length he fell into a violent fit
<PB N="167" REF="170">
of coughing, and the blood pouring in a torrent from his mouth, he dropt lifele&s;s at my &s;eet.</P>
<P>I apprehended that the blow had &s;lightly irrupted a blood ve&s;&s;el about the heart; that thus he had for a time bled inwardly, until the parts being clogged with coagu|lated and extrava&s;ated blood, the coughing was brought on by a violent effort of na|ture to di&s;charge the inconvenience &s;he laboured under; that this had enlarged the orifice of the irrupted ve&s;&s;el, and thus immediate death was the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>The humanity of the reader will form that picture of my calamitous &s;ituation that I am unable to de&s;cribe. Seated on the bank, &s;carcely elevated enough to pre|&s;erve me from the influx of the roaring waves that beat again&s;t an inacce&s;&s;able rock, of which my place of &s;helter formed the ba&s;e; my dead friend by my &s;ide, the &s;hades of night &s;urrounding me, uncertain
<PB N="168" REF="171">
where fortune had thrown me, I was &s;o &s;unk with melancholy, and petrified with horror, that my harra&s;&s;ed faculties could &s;carcely teach me to think; and &s;itting with my mind thus torpid and &s;u&s;pended, reflection my torment, and my relief my tears; day, that welcome harbinger of happine&s;s to others, &s;eemed to &s;mile be|nignly upon creation only to point out the mo&s;t deplorable object in it.</P>
<P>I had but two things, to peri&s;h or to be re&s;olute. If gracious Providence had &s;aved me from &s;hipwreck, afterwards from certain death, or di&s;honour, among the Caffres, and at length from a perilous voyage in a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el upon a tremen|dous &s;ea, why &s;hould I accelerate my fate? Ought not rather the magnitude of my danger to make me look it in the face? To &s;truggle all I could again&s;t it; and, at la&s;t, if it &s;hould overwhelm me, I &s;hould &s;ink into peace with the con&s;cious re|flection that I had not &s;hortened a life
<PB N="169" REF="172">
tru&s;ted not to my di&s;po&s;al, but the di&s;po&s;al of him who gave it.</P>
<P>Searching now in my mind for re|&s;ources, I became more and more deter|mined. I fir&s;t looked for the boat, but, alas, my feeble &s;trength had not &s;ecured it &s;o as to bear the buffetting of the flow|ing and ebbing tide. No trace of it re|mained, and, I dare &s;ay, that for many hours it had floated out to &s;ea.</P>
<P>I in&s;tantly reflected that it was a mercy I had not been carried off by the tide in the &s;ame manner, which mu&s;t have been the ca&s;e had not the moon been in the wane; for by ob&s;erving the objects about, I could ea&s;ily perceive that the &s;pring tides flowed con&s;iderably higher than the top of the bank on which I &s;tood; it was, therefore, impo&s;&s;ible I could main|tain my po&s;ition for more than a day or two at mo&s;t. I determined to take my
<PB N="170" REF="173">
mea&s;ures without delay; and having vowed to him who gave me my being, that I would not re&s;ign it till it &s;hould be his plea&s;ure, nor repine any farther than the weakne&s;s of human nature compelled me, I began my pious ta&s;k with con&s;igning, I would I could &s;ay, to a peaceful grave, the &s;ad remains of my poor companion.</P>
<P>With a &s;hell, which lay on the &s;hore, I contrived with much difficulty, to dig a hole large enough to hold the body; and having, with great labour and trouble, placed it there, after a &s;hort, but fervent prayer to the Deity, I concealed the &s;hocking &s;pectacle from my eyes, though Heaven knows it will never be &s;hut out from my remembrance.</P>
<P>My next care was to &s;ee for a &s;afer place of &s;helter, for which purpo&s;e I kept along the &s;hore at the foot of the rock, where having rambled, I &s;uppo&s;e, about three miles, I de&s;erned an inlet, who&s;e
<PB N="171" REF="174">
banks &s;eemed to penetrate into the coun|try; and as the water at the time I di&s;|covered it, ran from it towards the &s;ea, I had no doubt but that, at its &s;ource, it mu&s;t be fre&s;h.</P>
<P>This di&s;covery gave me a plea&s;ure which I cannot expre&s;s. I had hardly, properly &s;peaking, ta&s;ted good water &s;ince we left Trincomalee. On board of &s;hip every body knows it is very difficult to have good water; that on the coa&s;t of Africa, when we could get any at all, which was very rare, was, at be&s;t, bracki&s;h; and &s;ince I left the Caffres, the pre&s;erved juice of cooling fruits &s;erved us for its &s;ub&s;titute.</P>
<P>I was, therefore, very anxious to fol|low up this di&s;covery, but the attempt was attended with difficulty. The banks, if I may &s;o call them, of this rivulet, were compo&s;ed of ragged points of rock jetting
<PB N="172" REF="175">
out, &s;ometimes &s;o bold that they could not be attempted without manife&s;t hazard.</P>
<P>Seeing this I changed my cour&s;e and took a circuitous route, in a more practi|cable direction, where the rivulet &s;eemed to wind. By this means, after &s;ome fa|tigue, I got upon an elevation, from whence I could &s;ee great part of the coun|try around me, which I found partly rocky, partly verdant, and every where abounding with wildne&s;s and luxuriancy.</P>
<P>Roaming about in this uncertain &s;tate, if I had hitherto been prevented from tracing the river to its bed, I was made ample amends by another object which I may fairly call manna in the wilderne&s;s. It was the plantain tree, which &s;pread its nutrimental golden clu&s;ters within my reach; &s;o that, in this &s;hort interval, I had a pro&s;pect of water and a certainty of bread.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="176">
Oh Heaven! what were my &s;en&s;ations now? The gratitude that warmed my &s;oul infu&s;ed into my heart a glow of delight that in&s;pired me with the felicity of angels.</P>
<P>I now pur&s;ued the track of the river with more ardour than ever; and pene|trating through a thick clu&s;ter of cedars, round which it &s;eemed to wind, &s;till taking care to mark my way, I came to a &s;loping lawn, down which it gently rolled; its &s;ource, apparently, being the top of a very high mountain, &s;kirted with palms, cedars, cocoa trees, and other lofty pro|ductions of the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e re&s;earches having &s;o beguiled the time, that I plainly &s;aw it would be in vain, before the tide &s;et in, to attempt a retreat, I concluded to ramble about and &s;leep for that night at the foot of a tree, in the mean time, having eaten &s;ome fruit of the plantain, and drank &s;ome mo&s;t de|licious water, I &s;trolled to that part of the
<PB N="174" REF="177">
rock next the &s;ea; when coming, unex|pectedly, to the prominence which imme|diately overlooked the bank on which I had &s;o di&s;mally pa&s;&s;ed the night before, good Heaven! what did I behold?</P>
<P>A huge &s;ea lion had raked the body of the carpenter's mate out of the &s;and, and was at that moment fea&s;ting upon it. I gazed with horror and &s;urprize, and again felt that &s;weet &s;en&s;ation of gratitude that has &s;o often repaid me, by one moment's exqui&s;ite plea&s;ure for days and months of pain. Could I di&s;tru&s;t that a particular providence watched over me! El&s;e why did I leave the place where I was &s;ure to meet inevitable de&s;truction? Why was I invited to the whole&s;ome plantain, and the refre&s;hing &s;pring? Was this chance? No; it was the e&s;pecial care of that power who I knew would never for&s;ake me, &s;o long as I put my tru&s;t in him.</P>
<P>Full of the&s;e thankful &s;en&s;ations, I
<PB N="175" REF="178">
ha&s;tened to the river, and filled with my chry&s;tal beverage, a &s;mall keg, which I had the precaution to &s;ling at my back; I then rea&s;cended the rock; and having found a beautiful retreat, interwoven with mo&s;s and thick tendrils, I made another &s;alutary meal, and when night approached, confi|dently re&s;igned my&s;elf into the arms of &s;leep.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP IV. HANNAH'S INGENUITY PUT TO THE TEST, 'TILL HAVING EXERCISED IT PRETTY VARIOUSLY, SHE FINDS HERSELF TOLLERABLY WELL OFF.</HEAD>
<P>I SLEPT in great tranquility for &s;everal hours; and having awoke a con&s;iderable time before day light, I began to ruminate on my &s;ituation, and to con&s;ider of every expedient nece&s;&s;ary for me to adopt, in order to make it as comfortable as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>With the boat I had certainly lo&s;t many re&s;ources, and the few things I had been able to get a&s;hore, as they con&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="177" REF="180">
only of &s;ome provi&s;ions we had brought away from the coa&s;t of Africa, &s;uch as a few jars of potted deer, and pre&s;erved fruits, they could now be of no material u&s;e to me. The jars, indeed, would have been welcome, but then I thought, per|haps, I might find &s;hells, or &s;ome other &s;ub&s;titute to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e as well.</P>
<P>I determined, at all adventures, not to return to the &s;and bank, and if I &s;hould find it nece&s;&s;ary, upon any occa|&s;ion, to &s;eek the &s;ea &s;hore, to do &s;o as carefully as po&s;&s;ible. The circum&s;tance of the &s;ea lion, was a very &s;erious cau|tion, and it behoved me to &s;hun every op|portunity of expo&s;ing my&s;elf to danger, from which, if it once &s;urrounded me, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for me to extricate my&s;elf.</P>
<P>After turning my &s;ituation in every
<PB N="178" REF="181">
po&s;&s;ible point of view, and making up my mind, as to my &s;afety, which I was deter|mined never to doubt till the con&s;umation of my fate &s;hould fill up the mea&s;ure of de&s;tiny, the &s;miling morn found me as chearful as it&s;elf, what had I to wi&s;h for but &s;helter, food, and rayment, and the&s;e the birds that warbled round my head, found ea&s;ily, and were thankful for the ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Why then &s;hould I repine? A thou|&s;and hou&s;es, built of the mo&s;t beautiful materials, and erected by the mo&s;t perfect architect, courted my acceptance. A &s;ingle rock could furni&s;h for me a magni|ficent dwelling with all its compartments. For food, I could not have luxuries, but I could imbibe health at every mouthful, and for cloathing, the inhabitants of that part of the world, needed none; and even if it were nece&s;&s;ary, to an ingenious mind, &s;omething might be ea&s;ily contrived
<PB N="179" REF="182">
out of leaves, feathers, and a variety of other materials that I could already per|ceive I &s;hould find in much greater abun|dance than would be nece&s;&s;ary to an&s;wer my purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>In this cheerful di&s;po&s;ition did I walk abroad; and while the birds hymned their gratitude to that power that gave them an|other day, my heart in &s;ilent &s;ervency joined the general thank&s;giving.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t idea was to &s;et my face to all that I could &s;tand the &s;malle&s;t po&s;&s;ible chance of encountering; for that purpo&s;e I &s;et about a&s;cending the mountain whence the river &s;eemed to derive its &s;ource; gue&s;&s;ing, which I own was my greate&s;t ap|prehen&s;ion, that I &s;hould thereby di&s;cover whether any part of the place was inhabited.</P>
<P>With great difficulty, in about &s;ix
<PB N="180" REF="183">
hours, I accompli&s;hed my purpo&s;e, when I plainly &s;aw I was upon an i&s;land, ac|cording to my judgment, of about five miles and a half by about nine miles, the whole view of which, like the Peak of Teneriffe, this emminence commanded. I did not di&s;ern the &s;malle&s;t trace of build|ings, or any thing that could lead me to believe that human creatures had ever been accu&s;tomed to re&s;ide there.</P>
<P>I &s;aw &s;ome wild deer, and an animal of the buffalo kind, and &s;everal &s;pecies of monkies; but they all ran away from me and took &s;helter in the woods. I had lo&s;t &s;o much time that I was under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of &s;leeping by the &s;ide of an im|men&s;e ba&s;on, which proved to be the &s;ource of the river, and which plainly, like the original re&s;ervoir at Antigua, was &s;up|plied by the clouds to fertilize the i&s;land.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed, however, a very uncomforta|ble
<PB N="181" REF="184">
night; the bellowing, braying and chat|tering of bea&s;ts, and the hi&s;&s;ing of &s;nakes, filled my mind with a good deal of ap|prehen&s;ion; and though I did not at all repent that I had made this experiment, I determined in future to keep in the more rocky part of the place, as I was con|vinced I &s;hould there be &s;ubject to le&s;s annoyance.</P>
<P>Mi&s;taking my way I de&s;cended by an|other branch of the river, which led me gradually to a ridge of rocks that extended far into the &s;ea, and at low water appeared &s;mall and ragged for a con&s;iderable di&s;|tance, not very unlike the Giants' Cau&s;e|way in Ireland. I was at fir&s;t di&s;appointed at this circum&s;tance; but as I went on I found I had no rea&s;on to be under much concern, for the plantain grew every where round in great perfection, and what gave me infinite plea&s;ure, I found orange, lime, citron, &s;haddock, and olive trees;
<PB N="182" REF="185">
and, in the brakes, there grew in large quantities, a &s;pecies of wild cotton.</P>
<P>In addition to this welcome di&s;covery I found that the river &s;pread through a verdant plain at the foot of a large rock, and continued upon a level &s;urface for many hundred yards; after which it &s;ud|denly di&s;appeared among the brakes, and through fi&s;&s;ures, and gave notice, only by its murmuring, that it bent its cour&s;e to the ocean.</P>
<P>Near the plain, through which, as I before ob&s;erved, glided the river, a large cavern ran into the rock to a prodigious extent, extremely in appearance like that part of the Derby&s;hire rocks, near Ca&s;tle|ton, which is called one of the wonders of the Peak. Here being &s;upplied with or|anges, citrons, and &s;everal other fruits, be&s;ides that of the plantain tree, having a large canal before my door, and being
<PB N="183" REF="186">
be&s;ides wonderfully &s;heltered from wea|ther and other inconvenience, I thought I could not do better than &s;et up my re&s;t, e&s;pecially as it was now high time to &s;quare the &s;ort of life I &s;hould lead by &s;omething like method and regularity.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place I had, by way of cloaths, only the wrapper I &s;poke of, with a piece of old mu&s;lin tied round my head, and a pair of &s;andals on my feet, made of a buffalo's hide, and tied with thongs of lea|ther. All the&s;e were inconveniencies which I had already con&s;idered how to remedy.</P>
<P>Again I wanted a comfortable place for repo&s;e, for though I had experienced good weather thitherto, I had no idea how long it might la&s;t. This place, I thought, I could ea&s;ily manage to procure my&s;elf within the hollow of the rock. Indeed I had formed a hundred projects, which I

had no doubt but I &s;hould &s;et about with great facility, and which, as well as being an agreeable bodily refre&s;hment, would &s;erve to amu&s;e my mind, and divert it from that di&s;traction that now and then, in &s;pight of all my fortitude, it was in|volved in.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;tep I took to effect my pur|po&s;e was to explore the different rece&s;&s;es of my cavern, which were divided and &s;ubdivided into apartments, rude, indeed, but &s;ome of them wonderfully compact and convenient. But what plea&s;ed me mo&s;t was that in all my re&s;earches I found nothing that could induce me to believe the place was infe&s;ted by any &s;avage or noxious animals.</P>
<P>As mortals, however, in proportion as they emancipate from their natural &s;tate, find many artificial wants, &s;o I felt out the nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;iderable alterations in
<PB N="185" REF="190">
my re&s;idence before I could make it tena|ble. Some apartments &s;weat with humidity, others were choaked up with brambles, and then &s;uch an univer&s;al gloom pervaded the whole place, that a light would be an article not to be di&s;pen&s;ed with.</P>
<P>The&s;e difficulties very frequently put me to a &s;tand; but as difficulty &s;timulates invention, and active minds &s;ucceed be&s;t when they &s;truggle with oppo&s;ition, &s;o in a very &s;hort time I had &s;urmounted almo&s;t every impediment likely to ob&s;truct my operations.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, having ob&s;erved a fi&s;&s;ure which gave a glimmering of light into the interior part of the cavern, I found it out on the out&s;ide, and having widened it by removing the earth and &s;tones about it, which happened to be little more than rubbi&s;h, where grew &s;ome low
<PB N="186" REF="191">
&s;hrubbery, I at different times obtained a perforation equal to three feet &s;quare.</P>
<P>This threw day into a great part of the the cavern, in the nature of a &s;kylight, but the reader mu&s;t not &s;uppo&s;e I was not aware that rain might enter it al&s;o, an in|convenience that it was my care to remedy, which I did in this manner:</P>
<P>I gathered &s;ome twigs from a tree, that were as &s;upple as oziers, and wattling them together in the nature of an open-work ba&s;ket, I formed them into a frame large enough for my purpo&s;e. Having done this I got together a quantity of plantain leaves, and wetting tho&s;e with a gum, that oozed from a tree, which &s;eemed to be a &s;pecies of the larch, I hardened them in the &s;un, and they grew tough and pelucid. The&s;e I placed on my frame; and having &s;lightly wattled another coat of oziers to &s;ecure them, I fixed them into their &s;itua|tion,
<PB N="187" REF="192">
placing earth, of an adhe&s;ive quality like clay, neatly at all the extremities, in the nature of putty, and thus made a com|plete window by way of &s;kylight.</P>
<P>My next care was to contrive &s;ome|thing like a couch to &s;leep upon. This I managed by forming a ba&s;ket in the nature of a cot, which I lined with matting made of the ru&s;hes that grew in great abundance and variety by the &s;ide of my canal. Hav|ing done this, I gathered a large quantity of cotton, picked it, and beat it with two &s;ticks, and then &s;pread it out in &s;lakes, or as the wool combers call it &s;livers; this done, I placed within my cot a layer of cotton and a layer of mats, until the whole formed a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of mattra&s;&s;es perfectly ela&s;tic; and thus by a little ingenuity, I contrived a mo&s;t comfortable bed.</P>
<P>Cloaths began now to be a material con&s;ideration. I had found the poor cap|tain's
<PB N="188" REF="193">
morning gown &s;o cumber&s;ome, and inconvenient, that I had re&s;erved only the &s;leeves and the back of it in their old &s;hape, and had torne all the re&s;t into aprons; but &s;till &s;o many parts of my body and limbs were expo&s;ed, that the parching rays of the &s;un became at la&s;t intolerable.</P>
<P>A variety of expedients &s;ugge&s;ted them&s;elves to remedy this inconvenience, but they were either impracticable for want of implements, or infefficient from the na|ture of the materials. I had plantain leaves, and the leaves of the catalpa, but could I have &s;ewed them together, their texture would not have borne it &s;o as to la&s;t any time.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t attempt that was attended with any thing like &s;ucce&s;s, was twi&s;ting cotton into a kind of ropes, and &s;o winding it round every part, in the &s;ame manner as the Hot|tentots twi&s;t round them the inte&s;tines of
<PB N="189" REF="194">
animals, &s;o that had the cotton been of many colours, I &s;hould have looked like a fury dre&s;&s;ed out in &s;nakes, but this fa&s;hion, which I found very uncomforta|ble, &s;oon gave way to another.</P>
<P>I dre&s;&s;ed &s;ome fine cotton into as thin flakes as po&s;&s;ible, by means of the prickly pear leaf, which is formed exactly like an in&s;trument for carding. This done, I &s;pun with a kind of common di&s;taff, a large quantity of cotton thread, &s;ome fine, &s;ome coar&s;e; then, with a thorn, that I u&s;ed for a needle, I &s;ewed the edges of the&s;e &s;livers together till I had got a large piece, but this was making very little progre&s;s, for the lea&s;t ten&s;ion would have pulled all my work to pieces.</P>
<P>What I had done, however, was a great point gained. My next &s;cheme was to form a net with large open ma&s;hes, of an extent &s;ufficient to cover my cotton,
<PB N="190" REF="195">
which having done on one &s;ide I found it nece&s;&s;ary to do the &s;ame on the other; thus the cotton lay between the two nets, exactly like wadding in a cloak; and the net being fa&s;tened at proper di&s;tances, by the knots, it kept pretty well together.</P>
<P>To effect all this took me a great deal of time, and was an inconceivable trouble to me; and, at la&s;t, I could do nothing with my netting to an&s;wer any good pur|po&s;e, till I had wa&s;hed it, dipped it in gum water, and &s;tretched it in the &s;un to dry.</P>
<P>Having pretty well carried this point, I braided cotton thread into laces of given lengths, and, at la&s;t, formed a &s;ort of dre&s;s cut in the fa&s;hion, and laced on in the manner of a harlequin's jacket and trow&s;ers.</P>

to another, which, though it did not &s;ug|ge&s;t it&s;elf till after I had taken &s;o much trouble, was perfectly obvious, and an|&s;wered every de&s;ired end, being nothing more than a jacket and trow&s;ers, knit with cotton in the nature of knitting a &s;tocking.</P>
<P>For my head I formed a &s;ort of helmit out of ru&s;hes, which I lined with fine cot|ton, and for my feet I made &s;andals of very &s;mall oziers, which I lined with cot|ton and fa&s;tened with laces.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. IN WHICH HANNAH CONTRIVES TO BEGIN HER HIS|TORY; SHE IS VISITED BY INNUMERABLE GUESTS OF TWO SORTS; SHE PROVIDES AGAINST THE RAINY SEASON, WHICH, COMING ON, SHE EXPE|RIENCES VERY DISAGREEABLE EFFECTS FROM IT.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE &s;aid that I left Cafraland on Wedne&s;day the 2d day of October, 1782; &s;o that being &s;ix days, and part of the &s;e|venth day, at &s;ea, I landed on the de&s;olate i&s;land, where I have ever &s;ince re&s;ided, on Wedne&s;day the 9th; and it was not until Saturday the 30th of November, that I found my&s;elf in the comfortable &s;ituation I have ju&s;t de&s;cribed; nay, when it is
<PB N="194" REF="199">
con&s;idered how much I mu&s;t have had to impede my exertions, the wonder will be how I was able to accompli&s;h it in &s;o &s;hort a time.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, as it was my inten|tion to retire to the &s;and bank on the even|ing of the day I left it, I brought nothing with me that could be of any u&s;e but a keg and a knife. The knife I unfortu|nately lo&s;t by the way, and this misfortune I very much lamented, for it was indi&s;pen|&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to have &s;ome &s;harp in&s;tru|ment in &s;uch work as cutting and &s;haping &s;ticks, &s;takes, ozier twigs, and ru&s;hes.</P>
<P>Luckily my keg was &s;trongly hooped with iron, and I had no doubt but I &s;hould be able to accompli&s;h, by means of the hoops, after &s;ome difficulty, every thing I wanted. A fire was now indi&s;pen&s;ibly ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and my bu&s;ine&s;s was either by friction or &s;ome other means, to procure one.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="200">
I rubbed two &s;ticks together, which certainly, after &s;ome trouble, emitted &s;omething pho&s;phoric, but which, the wood being green, I could not fairly bring to a burning &s;tate. I then &s;truck &s;everal hard &s;tones again&s;t the hoops of my keg, holding &s;ome cotton underneath, but nei|ther were the &s;parks &s;trong enough, nor the cotton inflamable enough to produce fire.</P>
<P>At length, after a variety of ineffectual experiments, perceiving that &s;ome &s;and, which formed, a few days before, only an incru&s;tation, had now, by the heat of the &s;un become vitrified, I had great hopes I might effect my purpo&s;e through this me|dium, in the nature of a burning gla&s;s, for its form was very nearly concave, and I was not to learn that any thing concave, that has the power of reflection, acts ac|cording to the laws of reflection, and in|clines
<PB N="196" REF="201">
the rays of light to a point in their axis, the burning depending upon the union of rays, and the union of rays on the concave &s;perical figure. Thus I have known gilded wooden mirrors, as they are fal&s;ely called, alaba&s;ter, covered with gold, or foil, nay, even mirrors made of paper, covered with &s;traw, to emit rays of heat, &s;o as to burn inflamable objects, with which they have come in contact.</P>
<P>I don't know how far an experiment would have an&s;wered my purpo&s;e, for I did not try one, an accident of a &s;ingular nature having prevented me. Looking round where I had &s;wept together a va&s;t quantity of leaves, which I had from time to time &s;tript off the oziers, for I had made an excellent broom, on which heap was thrown heavy rubbi&s;h, in order to keep my working place clean, a method I never neglected, a &s;moke i&s;&s;ued from the place. I was in&s;tantly a&s;toni&s;hed at my&s;elf, that I
<PB N="197" REF="202">
had not thought of a thing &s;o &s;elf evident, this being a common expedient to procure fire, but it is in our natures to &s;earch at random for what reflection would have &s;hewn us in a beaten track.</P>
<P>I encouraged the heat by beating and pre&s;&s;ing it down with more &s;tones, till, at length, the &s;moke encrea&s;ing, it bur&s;t into a flame, exactly upon the principle of an overheated hay rick, &s;o that at pre&s;ent I left my &s;cheme of trying an experiment on my vetrified incru&s;tation, which I deter|mined, however not to abandon; for find|ing the compo&s;ition extremely in the na|ture of the Chine&s;e petun&s;e, I had no doubt but I &s;hould one day be able to make gla&s;s, if not porcelaine, the whole progre&s;s of which I had completely made my&s;elf mi&s;tre&s;s of during my &s;tay in the vicinage of Derby.</P>
<P>But the nece&s;&s;aries of life being my
<PB N="198" REF="203">
fir&s;t object, it was proper that all idea of the luxuries &s;hould, at pre&s;ent give way, I therefore, encouraged my fire, and went &s;o well to work, that it turned out of great u&s;e to me. I pitched upon a &s;tone of the temper of porphyry, for my anvil; and having taken off the hoops from my keg, I &s;traitened them, and now I was in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;even pieces of iron, about twenty-&s;even inches long, three quarters of on inch wide, and the &s;ixteenth of an inch thick.</P>
<P>I took one of the hoops, and heating it in the fire, I doubled it in two; then again, and again, till having worked them each time with a poli&s;hed &s;tone into per|fect cohe&s;ion, I had a &s;olid piece of iron, more than half an inch thick, and about three inches long.</P>
<P>I took another hoop, which I worked with the &s;ame kind of labour, into a punch;
<PB N="199" REF="204">
and having hardened it, I beat my other piece of iron, at one end, to the &s;hape of a bricklayer's lathing hammer. I then punched a hole through the middle large enough to contain a handle, then hardened it, and thus I had a complete hammer, to drive at one end, and cut at the other.</P>
<P>I could now work more handily, and, indeed, I did &s;o to &s;o good a purpo&s;e; that before I had u&s;ed all my hoops, I was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hammer before menti|oned, two very good knives, a pair of &s;ci&s;|&s;ars, three punches of different &s;izes, and brads, and nails, to the tune of between three and four hundred. I attempted to make a &s;aw, but finding it would be no u&s;e without a file, which was beyond my ability, I thought I had better, as I &s;aid before, convert the materials into nails and brads, which I might again transform if I &s;hould find it nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Being thus furni&s;hed with implements
<PB N="200" REF="205">
it will not appear extraordinary that I &s;hould accompli&s;h all I have already re|lated, e&s;pecially when it is recollected that I had been perfectly in&s;tructed in the&s;e matters at Wolverhampton, where I once made a pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ars for a wager, though I had never attempted &s;uch a thing before.</P>
<P>In my intervals of lei&s;ure, during the pro&s;ecution of this work, it was my cu&s;tom to exame every thing around me, as well to &s;ee whether I could di&s;cover any ma|terials to a&s;&s;i&s;t my labours, as to &s;earch for &s;hell fi&s;h. In this latter pur&s;uit I was particularly fortunate, for I found, towards the &s;hore, plenty of &s;ea &s;nails, limpets, and that delicious dainty known by the name of the hammer oy&s;ter.</P>
<P>In a lake al&s;o, or ba&s;on, formed in a hollow rock, and which communicated both with the &s;ea and my river, according to circum&s;tances, I di&s;covered &s;everal &s;orts of fi&s;h, which I apprehended came into the
<PB N="201" REF="206">
fre&s;h water to &s;pawn, exactly as &s;almon and other fi&s;h are known to do in En|gland. Among the&s;e there was a kind of congereel, or rather a &s;ea &s;nake. This gave me particular plea&s;ure, not only on account of the &s;kin, which I knew would &s;erve me for a variety of u&s;es, but for the oil it would yield me.</P>
<P>In this lake al&s;o I found part of a &s;hark's &s;keleton, which creature had, no doubt, ventured, during a &s;pring tide, to follow the fi&s;h that took &s;helter there, and had got into &s;uch &s;hoal water, that he was unable to get back again, and was thus &s;tarved to death. The bones of this fi&s;h, which was of the lamia &s;pecies, I put to various u&s;es, but the teeth were particu|larly &s;erviceable to me, every one of them &s;erving for an excelent &s;aw, a tool of all others I &s;tood mo&s;t in need of.</P>
<P>Being now provided with every thing
<PB N="202" REF="207">
that could po&s;&s;ibly be of u&s;e to me, even to a comb, which I formed out of the &s;he'll of a land crab, I thought there would be no crime if I went on even to luxuries, as it would give a new &s;pur to my genius, and employ my mind, ever active in tho&s;e pur&s;uits be&s;t calculated to expand it, and thus diver&s;ify my employments, &s;o as to leave no time for the intruder care.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t I panted to gratify what I had always a longing for, which was no le&s;s than, by &s;ome means, to &s;et down the eventful particulars of my &s;trange hi&s;tory. I had &s;een at Surat, a Malabar manu&s;cript, which &s;eemed to be wrought, not written, on palm leaves, by the intervention of &s;ome medium which bit in the letters ex|actly upon the &s;ame principle as acqua|fortis is u&s;ed for etching upon copper. This art certainly came from the antients, who, when they had occa&s;ion to &s;et down any thing they compo&s;ed, u&s;ed tablets
<PB N="203" REF="208">
coated with wax, on which they wrote with a needle, pointed at one end for the purpo&s;e of marking the words, and flatted at the other for the purpo&s;e of effacing the errors. In this they mu&s;t have u&s;ed &s;ome compo&s;ition; for in order to promulgate their opinions, fair copies were taken upon a &s;ort of paper called charta, made from the plant papyrus, which grows in Egypt; or el&s;e upon a &s;ort of parchment, or vel|lum made from the &s;kins of animals, which was called membranas, indeed, the origin of writing mu&s;t have been leaves, the divi|&s;ions of a book being to this day called by that name.</P>
<P>In imitating of the&s;e methods, I dried plantain leaves, took the &s;ounde&s;t of them, and having &s;pread a thin gum over them, I u&s;ed a corro&s;ive &s;ub&s;tance, &s;ome|thing of the nature of what i&s;&s;ues from the mangeneal tree, which marked upon the
<PB N="204" REF="209">
leaf pretty well; but I was very awkward at fir&s;t, e&s;pecially as I had to mark every thing with a point, and afterwards fill up the inter&s;tices with the compo&s;ition. Ha|bit, however, rendered the ta&s;k pretty prac|ticable; and having at la&s;t managed to make an iron pen, I lowered my ingredient to the con&s;i&s;tency of ink, and afterwards wrote with tolerable facility.</P>
<P>Before I began my grand work I cleared my way; and having wiped off tho&s;e different calculations of what had happened to me at particular times &s;ince I had been deprived of the u&s;ual methods of communication, and which calculations I had made by means of pins, knots in a &s;tring, &s;takes driven into the ground, &s;hells placed at particular di&s;tances, or any other method that &s;truck me at the time as pro|per to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e, I was prepared by the 1&s;t of January, 1783, to begin my hi&s;tory.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="210">
The main chance, however, was the object mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for my attention; and though I was determined to give as much time as I could properly &s;pare, to recording my life, even though my la|bours &s;hould never &s;ee the light, yet pru|dence whi&s;pered to me, that there were many important duties al&s;o to be per|formed if I expected to be comfortable.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place the weather had been wonderfully favourable for me thitherto, but I knew &s;o well the nature of that cli|mate, that I mu&s;t not expect it to continue &s;o for any length of time, my bu&s;ine&s;s, therefore, was to guard again&s;t every emer|gency; and, in particular, I con&s;idered that it would be nece&s;&s;ary to furni&s;h my|&s;elf with &s;uch a &s;tock as &s;hould an&s;wer every purpo&s;e, in ca&s;e I &s;hould be obliged during the rainy &s;ea&s;on, to keep hou&s;e.</P>
<P>As, however, this urgency did not
<PB N="206" REF="211">
&s;eem &s;o very pre&s;&s;ing as, at pre&s;ent, to de|mand a &s;acrifice of every thing el&s;e; I ap|portioned my time &s;o as to have alternately &s;ome labour and &s;ome amu&s;ement. This was my general mode of pa&s;&s;ing the twenty four hours.</P>
<P>I aro&s;e &s;oon after the &s;un; and having offered up a mo&s;t &s;incere thank&s;giving to him who had permitted me to &s;urvive &s;o many trials, I walked out; and according as I was guided by the tide, either &s;ought for &s;hell fi&s;h, angled in my river, or &s;earched for &s;uch food as &s;hould be ne|ce&s;&s;ary, for my pre&s;ent and future pur|po&s;es.</P>
<P>Having &s;tocked my&s;elf to my mind, I retired home to breakfa&s;t, which meal, by this time, I had made very comfortable. In an infu&s;ion from the &s;agoe tree, I found a plea&s;anter and more nutritive beverage than tea, and the plantain fruit, kneaded
<PB N="207" REF="212">
and baked, produced me an eatable, at lea&s;t, equal to York&s;hire cakes.</P>
<P>After breakfa&s;t I went about all the manual labour, nece&s;&s;ary for that day, till twelve o'clock, when I &s;et about my cookery, which generally con&s;i&s;ted of lim|pets &s;tewed with rice, or Indian wheat, with both of which I was now &s;tocked; or el&s;e the hammer oy&s;ter roa&s;ted, or &s;ome other fi&s;h, of which, particularly one very delicious, and extremely like the bara|coota, my lake abounded.</P>
<P>Immediately after dinner I went to writing. This was my employment till four o'clock, then I indulged my&s;elf with a mo&s;t delightful walk, in which I often made new di&s;coveries. This was the mo&s;t plea&s;ing, yet the mo&s;t melancholy part of the day; for though every object furni&s;hed me with a new motive for contemplation; and though every day's experience gave
<PB N="208" REF="213">
my heart a fre&s;h rea&s;on to throb with gra|titude for the tranquility I enjoyed, yet the declining &s;un never failed to ca&s;t a gloom over me, which nothing, perhaps, but the imbecility of human nature can, either account for or excu&s;e.</P>
<P>Before the day &s;et in I illuminated my apartments, for by this time I had made &s;everal lamps with layers of dried catalpa leaves cemented with gum, in the &s;ame manner as fire workers make their &s;mall mortars for <HI>pots de brins, pots des aigrettes.</HI> &amp;c. The oil I had boiled from the &s;ea &s;nake, I purified till it became &s;uperior to the be&s;t &s;permacaeta oil I ever &s;aw, and my wicks of cour&s;e, were made of cotton. I had it in contemplation to make candles, but the lamps an&s;wered my purpo&s;e, at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent, full as well.</P>
<P>My &s;upper was generally boiled rice, or el&s;e a &s;ort of millet, which I &s;weetened
<PB N="209" REF="214">
with an extract from the locu&s;t tree; and having taken this and clo&s;ed the day with the &s;ame gratitude to the Creator that I commenced it, I retired to my couch, &s;ometimes cheerful, &s;ometimes with a &s;igh, and now and then, perhaps, with a tear, and then re&s;igned my&s;elf to repo&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus I went on with very little varia|tion, except improving all my old &s;chemes, and contemplating new ones, and among the re&s;t, painting and mu&s;ic, both of which I had concerted how to bring about, till early in the month of March.</P>
<P>One morning, I &s;hall never forget it, As I took my walk, a &s;mall cloud, as it appeared to me, all of a &s;udden dimned the &s;un. It grew larger and larger, and more and more grew the gloom. Di&s;mayed at I knew not what, I &s;tood in a &s;tate of &s;tu|pefaction; my terror encrea&s;ed, till by
<PB N="201" REF="215">
and by, the mon&s;trous ma&s;s made to|wards the i&s;land which it &s;eemed large enough to cover. When I had recovered a little my &s;u&s;pended faculties, I di&s;cerned the truth; it was a cloud of birds; nor was it long before I was convinced of it by their chattering and &s;creaming. At length, with the mo&s;t hideous yells, they pitched every where about me; and I &s;oon di|vined, the&s;e creatures, like the birds that at certain &s;ea&s;ons of the year, build their ne&s;ts in many i&s;lands, particularly the I&s;le of Wight, had for that purpo&s;e paid my place a vi&s;it, and thus I &s;hould be troubled with them, perhaps, a few weeks, after which they would di&s;appear with their young. It now &s;truck me, that if I had adroitne&s;s enough, I &s;hould not only fur|ni&s;h my&s;elf with eggs, but fea&s;t upon the young ones.</P>
<P>I found nothing, except their hideous noi&s;e, that was di&s;agreeable to me. In a
<PB N="211" REF="216">
day or two, they began without any cere|mony to build their ne&s;ts, and I &s;oon &s;aw that with little difficulty I &s;hould &s;upply my&s;elf with as many eggs as I plea&s;ed; but it was not a week before another phenomenon appeared, which gave me much more unea&s;ine&s;s than the birds. This was no le&s;s than a whole &s;warm of monkies, who &s;eemed to have as great a reli&s;h for birds eggs as my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Many of the&s;e I had &s;een in the wood on the top of the mountain, as I before mentioned, where they took no notice of me; I was &s;oon convinced, however, this would not be the ca&s;e here. It is true, that at fir&s;t they avoided me; but as my form became more familiar to them, they came nearer and nearer, and demon|&s;trated by their chattering, that they had no objection to be more familiar with me. This gave me great unea&s;ine&s;s, e&s;|pecially
<PB N="112" REF="217">
as I perceived &s;everal among them of the large baboon kind.</P>
<P>I had luckily before the monkies made their appearance furni&s;hed my&s;elf with a large &s;tock of eggs. I, therefore, thought I had better &s;tay at home, and give up the idea of &s;earching for young birds; for that, probably, if I concealed my&s;elf for a time, when the birds went away, the monkies might di&s;appear al&s;o.</P>
<P>This an&s;wered my purpo&s;e very well for nine or ten days; but one morning, while at my work, I was &s;urprized by a mon&s;trous large baboon. The hideous wretch caught hold of me in a moment, and it was with great difficulty I &s;hook him off. I in&s;tantly menanced him in the mo&s;t determined manner, and he &s;eemed &s;o terrified at my voice that he &s;lunk away. He returned, however, and cringed, and fawned, and played &s;o many monkey's
<PB N="213" REF="218">
tricks, that the &s;triking re&s;emblance of his grimaces to the pert addre&s;&s;es of a cox|comb would have provoked me to laugh|ter, had it not been that I &s;aw plainly he grew bolder and bolder. At la&s;t, as he mo&s;t impudently advanced towards me, with one blow of my hammer, which I happened to have in my hand, I laid him dead at my feet.</P>
<P>I next dragged the horrid creature out of the cavern and threw it down the rock, where it &s;tuck on a craggy point as if in terorem to the re&s;t, and this effect I really began to think it had taken, for I pre&s;ently &s;aw the monkies in a croud chattering very bu&s;y about it, and in a very few days they all di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>I had nothing now but the birds to en|counter, and not having eaten animal food &s;o long, except fi&s;h, I took a ne&s;t of young ones, and found them an exceedingly fine
<PB N="214" REF="219">
di&s;h. They had very much the &s;lavour of wheatears, but were as large as pigeons. What a &s;tore to have &s;ome of the&s;e potted? I &s;et to work immediately, prepared a number of &s;hells; and through the me|dium of the wild al&s;pice, and other pun|gent aromatics, made &s;o excellent a &s;ea|&s;oning, that I am &s;ure, could it have been &s;ent from any di&s;tance in London, as a rariety, my di&s;h would have been con&s;i|dered as a delicious luxury at the fir&s;t tables.</P>
<P>I had now taken every precaution in ca&s;e the rainy &s;ea&s;on &s;hould &s;et in, and in one in&s;tance, it was well I did. I had very &s;oon found that my vi&s;itors, the birds, fed wholly on the plantain fruit; and before they decamped, if I did not take care, would fairly &s;trip all the trees in my neigh|bourhood, I therefore made a quantity of it into bi&s;cuit, and baked it hard for the purpo&s;e of &s;erving me like a &s;ea &s;tore.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="220">
And now came a mo&s;t dreary time in|deed. The birds, on the information of a few clouds, a&s;&s;embled one morning, and on the very next went gradually off in the &s;ame order I had &s;een them approach. They took their cour&s;e northward, le&s;&s;en|ing, until, to my view, they became a point, and then nothing.</P>
<P>In two days more it began to rain, and in a few hours the clouds &s;eemed to em|brace the i&s;land, threatened to overwhelm it. My river &s;welled, torrents of water poured down the rock, and an ordinary mind would have been terrified at the ap|prehen&s;ion of a compleat inundation. My only fear was that when the immen&s;e ba&s;on on the top of the mountain &s;hould overflow the natural receptacles for carrying off the water, would become ineffectual, and my &s;ituation, being not only &s;ubterraneous, but in &s;ome degree &s;ubaqueous, &s;ome tor|rent might force its way through the dif|ferent
<PB N="216" REF="221">
hollows of the rock, &s;o as to fill my habitation, in which ca&s;e I mu&s;t have ine|vitably peri&s;hed.</P>
<P>Perceiving nothing of this kind, how|ever, and finding the rain, though conti|nual, by no means violent; I made the be&s;t of my lot, and amu&s;ed my&s;elf as well as I could. I had got on pretty for|ward in my hi&s;tory, which was now al|mo&s;t my only employment; and, really, when upon peru&s;ing the different pa&s;&s;ages of my life, it called to my recollection that in a peopled world I had found as little a&s;&s;i&s;tance, except from my own ex|ertions, as in a de&s;olate i&s;land, I could not help, through the medium of pity, for the follies of my fellow creatures, taking to my&s;elf &s;ome &s;atisfaction for the rectitude of my intentions compared with the du|plicity of theirs.</P>
<P>In this manner did I go on, amu&s;ing
<PB N="217" REF="222">
my&s;elf, and beguiling the dreary time, until one morning&mdash;it was my birth-day&mdash;Oh Heaven, what a birth-day! I had in a long and &s;incere prayer thanked that Be|ing for all his mercies, who had graciou&s;ly permitted me to &s;ee thirty nine years pa&s;s over my head, I had breakfa&s;ted, felt my&s;elf uncommonly light and alert, when ju&s;t as I had laughed heartily at the whim|&s;ical manner that Walme&s;ley always made light of his misfortunes, I was &s;eized with a vertigo, and fell lifele&s;s on the ground.</P>
<P>When I came to my&s;elf, a cold &s;hiver|ing &s;ucceeded, my knees knocked together, and my teeth chattered in my head. I heaped fuel on my fire, and beginning to glow from its effects, I fell into a mo&s;t violent fever, but finding my&s;elf extremely dizzy, and feeling every &s;ymptom of an approaching delirium, I in&s;tantly took an emetic, which I had prepared from the
<PB N="218" REF="223">
ipecacuanha root, and to that, I have no doubt, I owe my life; for what the practice in England may be now I know not, but, though it was at one time very much &s;couted, I was one of the fir&s;t that induced the phy&s;icians in Warwick&s;hire to give emetics in an early &s;tage of a fever.</P>
<P>Could I have been comfortably lodged, I have no doubt but I &s;hould have been well in a day or two, but owing to the humidity every where around, which, in proportion as the rain continued, &s;weat through every pore of the rock, and to catching one cold upon another, I grew &s;o weak and &s;o emaciated, that I began &s;eriou&s;ly to think my un|fortunate days would very &s;hortly be numbered.</P>
<P>To add to my wretched &s;tate, I was &s;o nervous, that the lea&s;t noi&s;e threw me into the horrors. I fancied a thou&s;and dread|ful
<PB N="219" REF="224">
things. I have found my&s;elf conjur|ing the firm rock not to fall upon my head; the &s;ea not to &s;well up and drown me; I have held conver&s;ations with death, who conde&s;cendingly deigned to vi&s;it me that I might be familiarized to his pre|&s;ence. I had determined, for fear of &s;ur|prize, to make my coffin, and one morn|ing I actually caught my&s;elf digging my own grave.</P>
<P>I had &s;u&s;tained this dreadful compli|cation of complaints about &s;ix weeks, for ill as I was, I never failed to know how the time pa&s;&s;ed, when, to add to my &s;hocking di&s;tre&s;s, it began to blow &s;uch a hurricane as if all nature was threat|ened with annihilation. Pieces of the rocks were torne from their ba&s;e, and hurled into the &s;ea, trees were blown about like feathers; yet it had one good effect, it certainly relieved my nerves;
<PB N="220" REF="225">
and though I was bowed down to the earth, yet, the emergency being great, my mind met it with its u&s;ual fortitude. I was alarmed, but I thanked God that I was at la&s;t firm.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP VI. HANNAH IS DREADFULLY ALARMED, WHENCE THE ALARM PROCEEDED; HER APPREHENSIONS IN|CREASE; SHE IS WITNESS TO DISTRESS, WHICH SHE CANNOT RELIEVE; AND ESCAPES DEATH HERSELF IN A WONDERFUL MANNER.</HEAD>
<P>REDUCED both in body and mind to the deplorable condition I have ju&s;t de&s;cribed, I one night reclined upon my couch, ex|pecting, and, indeed, wi&s;hing for a &s;peedy termination of all my cares. The ele|mentary contention, that for two days had raged with &s;o much violence, &s;eemed to increa&s;e, and the horizon, on which I had been accu&s;tomed to &s;ee the &s;un de&s;cend
<PB N="222" REF="227">
with maje&s;ty, and a &s;erenity that gave piety to contemplation, was now tinged with a thick du&s;ky red, which reflected on the waves, and broken into a thou&s;and &s;hades by their agitation, gave the pro&s;pect an effect &s;o horribly tremendous, that it &s;eemed as if devoted nature was in&s;tantly to be engulphed in a &s;ea of blood.</P>
<P>Dreadful as this idea was, the enfeebled condition of my di&s;tracted frame &s;till heightened it; I &s;tretched out my hand, and having taken a little of a beverage I had that day made, which my &s;tomach &s;eemed to receive with unu&s;ual plea&s;ure, I &s;oon found my&s;elf inclined to &s;leep.</P>
<P>It was now quite dark, and I had &s;carcely recommended my&s;elf to that pro|vidence, which had hitherto &s;o graciou&s;ly watched over and protected me, and im|plored the &s;ame protection for my hu&s;|band, when I in&s;en&s;ibly &s;unk into the
<PB N="223" REF="228">
arms of &s;leep, but what words &s;hall de|&s;cribe my next &s;en&s;ation!&mdash;</P>
<P>I had &s;lept about eight hours, and was lo&s;t in one of tho&s;e delicious dreams, which, though they cannot be de&s;cribed, mu&s;t be remembered by every one, who, in &s;ickne&s;s, has experienced the moment at which delirium re&s;igns the mind to re|novation, when the firm rock trembled under me, the caverns groaned with a terrific noi&s;e, and the whole i&s;land &s;eemed as if &s;inking into nothing. The noi&s;e grew fainter and fainter, and, at length, I could hear nothing more than the agitated waves, and the whi&s;tling winds.</P>
<P>I had lain a few minutes in &s;tupid a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;carcely acknowledging life, or knowing how to u&s;e it, when another tremendous concu&s;&s;ion, like the former, &s;hook the i&s;land. The moment recol|lection had &s;ucceeded to wonder, I con|cluded
<PB N="224" REF="229">
it was an earthquake, and expected every moment to be &s;wallowed up; I, therefore, fell on my knees, and having put up a &s;hort but &s;incere prayer to the Deity, waited my fate in that po&s;ture with calm and determined re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>The fervour which my ejaculations had called forth in my mind, gave me un|common collection; and the noi&s;e being again repeated, I ea&s;ily noticed that its continuation, and gradually dying away, proceeded from a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of echoes. I, therefore, &s;uppo&s;ed that the violence of the &s;torm had torne away the prominent fragments of a rock, which falling into a hollow had cau&s;ed the noi&s;e and all its con&s;equences. This, of cour&s;e, di&s;pelled every apprehen&s;ion of per&s;onal danger, for which I uttered a pathetic thank&s;giving, and ro&s;e.</P>
<P>Finding my&s;elf wonderfully refre&s;hed
<PB N="225" REF="230">
by &s;leep, I made my way towards the door to &s;ee if I could di&s;cover whether the &s;torm had abated. In&s;tantly a fla&s;h beamed acro&s;s the cavern, which was fol|lowed by the noi&s;e in the &s;ame manner as before. I &s;hould have conceived that my alarm had proceeded from thunder, had I not particularly remarked, that the noi&s;e had nothing disjointed, or continual in it. It was one &s;ingle bur&s;t like an explo&s;ion, which was multiplied only by the echoes from the &s;urrounding rocks.</P>
<P>A gleam of hope at this in&s;tant darted acro&s;s my mind. It could not proceed from what I fir&s;t conjectured, becau&s;e of the fla&s;h. It could not be thunder&mdash;What then could it be but the explo&s;ion of a cannon? And from what could the explo&s;ion of a cannon proceed but from &s;ome &s;hip in di&s;tre&s;s in the Offing? I re|&s;olved, therefore, to &s;ally forth and fire a
<PB N="226" REF="231">
beacon, which I one day had rai&s;ed when my mind &s;eemed to anticipate this very accident.</P>
<P>De&s;pair lends &s;trength to the weak, and re&s;olution to the timid. I accom|pli&s;hed my purpo&s;e; and now what a variety of &s;en&s;ations agitated my mind! Who knew how many lives I might have been born to pre&s;erve? Who knew but my own wanderer, the author of all my wretchedne&s;s, might be &s;ent at la&s;t to alle|viate my deplorable condition! Four times did I hear the &s;ignal, and four times did I add fuel to my pile. At length the day appeared, and all my hopes va|ni&s;hed into nothing.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t here mention a circum&s;tance that I reflected on a long time with great horror. While I was attending the fire a mo&s;t hideous and frightful creature pa&s;&s;ed by me, and made its way towards
<PB N="227" REF="232">
the inacce&s;&s;able part of the rock, the &s;um|mit of which, as I before noticed, was co|vered with a thick wood. It appeared to me of the lion or tyger kind, and I con|cluded that its intention was to make me its prey; but alarmed by the fire, it had ran from that it meant to have pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>As the di&s;covery of one of the&s;e crea|tures denoted the exi&s;tence of more, I had no doubt but the i&s;land was overrun with wild bea&s;ts, a reflection of &s;o &s;hocking a nature, that it for a time ab&s;orbed every other con&s;ideration, nay, even that of my probable pre&s;ervation by means of the &s;hip; but, alas, Hope now &s;eemed deter|mined to de&s;ert me in every thing.</P>
<P>Day having dawned, it pre&s;ented a di&s;mal &s;pectable to my &s;ight. I di&s;erned, about three miles from the foot of the rock, a &s;hip firmly aground. The waves
<PB N="228" REF="233">
yet ran mountains high, and if it had not been for my entrenched &s;ituation, I could not have kept my footing to make my re|marks. Looking further, I &s;aw two boats full of people, &s;triving to &s;tem the fury of the &s;urge, and in &s;eeing them, I knew I &s;aw &s;o many people devoted to de&s;truc|tion. The &s;urf, curling round the imper|ceptable jagged points of the rock, were &s;o many vortexes from which it was im|po&s;&s;ible for them to e&s;cape. In &s;hort my fears were prophecies. The boats all &s;unk, and every &s;oul peri&s;hed.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t the whole day had I been in this anxious, di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;tate, with nothing to offer towards the &s;uccour of the&s;e poor &s;hipwrecked wretches but my prayers, when the &s;torm came on to rage with a degree of violence more dreadful than ever, accompanied with torrents of rain, &s;heets of vivid lightning, and peals of ter|rifying thunder. Indeed &s;oon did I wit|ne&s;s the difference between the ineffectual
<PB N="229" REF="234">
thunder invented by man, and that which &s;peaks the Deity; for if the poor &s;hip's &s;ignal of di&s;tre&s;s alarmed me in the morn|ing, &s;o tran&s;cendantly awful was what I now heard, that nothing but an implicit tru&s;t in him, in whom we live and move, and have our being, weak and ill as I was, could have pre&s;erved my rea&s;on, or, per|haps, my life.</P>
<P>Indeed I could not venture within the cavern, drenched as I was in rain, and weak for want of food, till the thunder had gone by, for there I knew the effect mu&s;t be much &s;tronger. The thunder cea&s;ed, but the &s;torm continued with equal, if not en|crea&s;ed violence, and the tide &s;etting in, the &s;prays, beat in &s;uch volumes again&s;t the rock that they &s;eemed to threaten its very &s;ummit.</P>
<P>Night now threw its &s;uneral paul over the&s;e devoted wretches, and I crept back,
<PB N="230" REF="235">
with difficulty, to my &s;helter; when light|ing my lamp, and throwing my&s;elf upon my couch, I began to reflect on the va|rious vici&s;&s;itudes of that unfortunate day. After &s;uch a &s;eries of mi&s;ery, chequered with expectation, after &s;o much promi&s;e, and &s;o much di&s;appointment, I lamented my fate in terms of the deepe&s;t de&s;|pondency. I wept aloud; and bewailing my&s;elf in expre&s;&s;ions of bittere&s;t agony, I had well nigh arrainged that providence on which I had &s;o often and &s;o effectually relied.</P>
<P>This interval, in which the weakne&s;s of human nature got the better for a mo|ment, of that &s;trength of mind which had hitherto borne me out through all my trials, though poignant, was &s;hort; I &s;oon re&s;umed my wonted fortitude; and the re|collection that &s;elf pre&s;ervation was a duty I owed that Being who gave me a life to pre&s;erve, induced me to &s;u&s;tain nature in
<PB N="231" REF="236">
the be&s;t manner I could; and after a hu|miliation, in which my tears wonderfully relieved me, I determined to &s;eek for means to pre&s;erve life, whatever mi&s;ery that life might occa&s;ion me.</P>
<P>I kindled a fire and heated &s;ome rice; but finding this food not &s;ufficiently nu|tritious to appea&s;e the gnawings of hunger, I roa&s;ted three or four limpits, which I devoured rather than ate, after which I drank rather profu&s;ely of my new be|verage, and retired to my couch.</P>
<P>I was in&s;tantly &s;eized with a delirium; my head &s;welled, re&s;piration was ob|&s;tructed, and I expected every moment would be my la&s;t. A violent vomiting, however, &s;ucceeded; and exertion of mind and body being at length exhau&s;ted, I fell into a &s;ort of &s;leep, or rather trance, out of which, after viewing, as in a dream, all the circum&s;tances of my life, I awoke
<PB N="232" REF="237">
in a very emaciated condition about ten o'clock the next morning.</P>
<P>My mind was at that moment in &s;uch a &s;tate that it feared to repine. Like a threatened child, it dreaded the rod, and deprecated that cha&s;ti&s;ement which it was not con&s;cious it de&s;erved. I felt my|&s;elf the offspring of humiliation, and de|termined, as far as human per&s;everance would allow me, to &s;uffer and &s;mile. Nor ever had I &s;uch cau&s;e to admire by what un&s;een ways the unerring hand of Provi|dence permits evil for our good.</P>
<P>I was about to drink of that beverage from which I had felt &s;uch &s;alutary effects; when, like a filmy phantom, beautiful at fir&s;t to the &s;ight, and afterwards changed to filth and deformity, I nau&s;eated its view, its &s;mell, and its ta&s;te. I in&s;tantly, of cour&s;e, forbore to touch it. The truth beamed acro&s;s my mind in a moment. I
<PB N="233" REF="238">
had &s;wallowed poi&s;on. The fir&s;t do&s;e being a &s;mall quantity, operated on my di&s;tempered frame in the cordial and re|&s;torative manner I there de&s;cribed, but the &s;econd, being more potent, had it not been for the oppo&s;ition from the quantity of the food I had eaten, and particularly the limpits, which are very mu&s;cular, and hard of dige&s;tion, it would have deprived me of exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Having found, as I imagined, the me|longena, or egg plant; which every body knows, and which, particularly abroad, is e&s;teemed as a &s;timulus, e&s;pecially for the purpo&s;e of throwing warmth through the circulation and to the extremities when, owing to any ob&s;truction, the vital heat is confined round the region of the heart, I made it into what I thought a re&s;torative cordial; which I have frequently ta&s;ted; but it is plain I had mi&s;taken this plant for that &s;pecies of the mandragore called the
<PB N="234" REF="239">
mad apple, which is a &s;olanum and a deadly poi&s;on.</P>
<P>Reflecting on this circum&s;tance in every view, I was profu&s;e in my acknow|ledgments to Providence that had pre|&s;erved me. Had I not been hurried from the cavern by the &s;ignal of di&s;tre&s;s, I &s;hould have had recour&s;e to that beverage who&s;e &s;alutary effects I had experienced the night before, and that way been poi|&s;oned. Had I found opportunity during the cour&s;e of the day, I &s;hould have at|tended the &s;ame experiment, and &s;o have been poi&s;oned. Had I not &s;trongly felt the calls of hunger when I came back, and eat inordinately, I &s;hould, in that ca&s;e, have been poi&s;oned. The humility, the &s;anctity, the confidence, the fortitude, and, above all, the gratitude, and the &s;erenity that the&s;e con&s;iderations rai&s;ed in my mind, I &s;hall ever feel, but &s;hall never be able to de&s;cribe.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="240">
I was determined after this never to call any thing an affliction; and, as the &s;torm continued with undimini&s;hed rage, I re|&s;olved to &s;tay at home, and endeavour to re&s;tore my &s;trength before I made any further ob&s;ervations.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. A PROSPECT OF RELIEF BROUGHT ABOUT BY A MOST EXTRAORDINAY ACCIDENT, AND AN IN|STANCE OF HANNAH'S PIETY, WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE FOUND ITS REWARD.</HEAD>
<P>I STEWED &s;ome limpits, and made a be|verage from rai&s;ons, which I cooled by the addition of &s;mall pieces of a chalky &s;ub|&s;tance, that were &s;cattered about among the viens in the rock, and &s;trongly im|pregnated with nitrous particles. The limpet broth, which I took &s;paringly, proved a powerful re&s;torative, and the be|verage, which by the infu&s;ion of a root corre&s;ponding with our liquorice, became
<PB N="237" REF="242">
a very good pti&s;anne, refre&s;hed me and kept off the fever; and in the cour&s;e of two days, by which time the &s;torm entirely &s;ub&s;ided, I was able, without ri&s;k, to &s;alley forth again and make my ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>My perqui&s;itions were completely in vain. I could di&s;cern no trace, not even a &s;ingle ve&s;tige of the &s;hip, the boats, nor any human creature, dead or alive; and after traver&s;ing every acce&s;&s;able port, and even venturing to the very verge of the promontary, I was obliged to conclude that the tempe&s;t had borne the &s;hip from the place where &s;he &s;truck, and had either &s;unk her at a di&s;tance from the &s;hore, or da&s;hed her to pieces again&s;t &s;ome other part of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>In this temper I moved &s;lowly back again to the cavern, where though, through the infirmity of human nature, I &s;hed a flood of tears, I would not permit my tongue to
<PB N="238" REF="243">
utter a &s;ingle murmur. An involuntary &s;igh, however now and then e&s;caped me; and, in the bitterne&s;s of my reflections, I could not help wi&s;hing that if either of the boats had contained John Hewit, that I had but &s;een him and peri&s;hed in his arms.</P>
<P>Exploring the different rece&s;&s;es of the cavern in &s;earch of mofs, and that chalky &s;ub&s;tance I &s;poke of before, I took a turn by accident round a &s;ort of natural column and got into another large chamber like that I occupied, As this was further re|mote from the entrance, and con&s;equently more &s;heltered from the weather, I re|joiced at the di&s;covery, and concluded it might be expedient for me to change my habitation.</P>
<P>This induced me to pay every atten|tion to the &s;ituation of the place, and for that purpo&s;e I &s;truck out of it into a pa&s;&s;age which &s;eemed to lead on a de&s;cent to a
<PB N="239" REF="244">
con&s;iderable di&s;tance. I had my lamp with me all this while, but ob&s;erving a cranny through which beamed a glimmer of light, in order to di&s;cover whence it came, I laid the lamp down and walked up to the place without it.</P>
<P>I &s;oon di&s;covered that it was only a reflection from another opening in a loftier &s;ituation, and much larger, and this la&s;t &s;eemed to be dammed up with &s;ome &s;ub|&s;tance that prevented it from conveying the light &s;o clear and pure as it had been immediately received from the atmo|&s;phere. In &s;hort, I conjectured that other fragments of the rock, built higher and higher, made their way into the air, and ob&s;tructed the free communication of light by means of this opening.</P>
<P>I don't know what induced me to follow up my di&s;covery, for one thing it &s;truck me, that I might with greater facility than
<PB N="240" REF="245">
I had been accu&s;tomed to, get at the eggs of tho&s;e fowls, another &s;ea&s;on, which had proved &s;o nutritious.</P>
<P>Something more than this curio&s;ity cer|tainly urged me on, nay I trembled, I knew not why, at every &s;tep. My &s;en&s;ations, however, were not induced by fear, on the contrary I was full of a &s;olicitous anxiety, &s;uch as I had often felt, but, I think, never &s;o forcibly. That mixture of plea&s;urable and painful &s;u&s;pence that has a&s;&s;ailed me on the eve of every great event during my life, produced a pre&s;entiment that con|vinced me &s;uch an event was at hand, nor was I long before my expectations were verified.</P>
<P>When I arrived at the opening in the rock I could plainly perceive that the ob|ject which ob&s;tructed the light was a part of &s;ome &s;hip; and pre&s;ently afterwards I crept into her without difficulty through
<PB N="241" REF="246">
one of her ports. I next got up the fore|ca&s;tle, and there perceived, by her form, that &s;he could be no other than the ve&s;&s;el I had &s;een a&s;hore, but how &s;he could have come into that &s;ituation, jammed into a cleft of a rock, I could not for the life of me imagine.</P>
<P>Examining, however, around, I con|cluded, that as the tide &s;et in, the violence of the tempe&s;t had brought the &s;hip along with it, and by the influence of a tornado had thrown her into that &s;ituation; where the &s;torm having abated, &s;he was &s;afe from danger as in a dry dock; and putting cir|cum&s;tances together, I found nothing ex|traordinary in this, for in the year 1778, or thereabouts, the hurricanes in the We&s;t-Indies, did actually tear ve&s;&s;els from their moorings and thrown them into the towns. One in&s;tance of which happened at Fort Royal, in Jamaica, and another at St. Kitts.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="247">
If I was ungrateful enough to murmur at my former di&s;appointment, how did I take &s;hame to my&s;elf at the pre&s;ent mo|ment. To &s;ee &s;uccour, comfort, conve|nience, nay, even luxury, brought, as it were, to my very door! Oh how my grateful heart ran over! I almo&s;t gloried in my &s;trong trials, convinced that I was &s;till the care of Providence, who&s;e in&s;crutable decrees, however weak &s;ighted mortals may dare to di&s;pute them, permit not a fly to peri&s;h in vain.</P>
<P>When my mind became a little more calm, I determined to examine the &s;hip. By her &s;ize &s;he mu&s;t have been of &s;even or eight hundred tons burthen, &s;he was coppered bottomed, and wore, in every re&s;pect, the appearance of an Indiaman; and by her lading, I &s;oon found &s;he was homeward bound. In examining her more particularly, I di&s;covered that a large part of her cargo yet remained on board, &s;ome of which had been materially damaged in
<PB N="243" REF="248">
con&s;equence of her having filled with wa|ter, though &s;he was perfectly dry at this time, the water having ran out again through her leaks.</P>
<P>And now a dreadful &s;pectacle pre&s;ented it&s;elf to my view. Five dead bodies lay between decks in a mo&s;t lacerated &s;tate; a little further, three more; and at the door of a cabin, which I found afterwards to be the pur&s;er's, a man and woman of genteel appearance, were locked in each other's arms. I &s;u&s;tained all this mi&s;ery with the be&s;t fortitude I could, determined, before I con&s;idered the living, to pay every due re&s;pect I could to the dead.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e poor wretches were three women and &s;even men. I &s;earched their pockets with a view to learn who they were, but in this my expectation failed, except in four in&s;tances. The gentleman and lady I found in each other's arms, were
<PB N="244" REF="249">
Mon&s;. and Madame D'Oliviere, a young man, well dre&s;&s;ed, was called D'Aubignac, and a woman, apparently an attendant, was named Jeannotte Du Bois.</P>
<P>This intelligence I gathered from let|ters, pocket books, and other documents I found about them; I al&s;o found other things, &s;uch as knives, &s;ci&s;&s;ars, hou&s;wives and articles of u&s;e, which to me turned out of &s;ingular convenience, and now having, by way of refre&s;hment, eaten &s;ome bu&s;cuit and drank a &s;mall quantity of excellent arrack to give me &s;pirits, I began my pious work.</P>
<P>I unpacked a bale of chintz, and &s;ewed up each body in a double piece of it, as tight as my poor &s;trength would permit me, and as much as po&s;&s;ible in the &s;hape of a mummy, except the hu&s;band and wife, who I wrapt up in each others arms as I found them, which I con&s;idered as ful|filling
<PB N="245" REF="250">
the will of the dead, their la&s;t wi&s;h, apparently, being never to be &s;eperated.</P>
<P>This awful ta&s;k took me up nearly three hours. My next care was to &s;ee for a place where to depo&s;it the&s;e relics of mortality; and on looking from the &s;ide of the &s;hip I &s;aw a hole of about a yard diameter, which &s;eemed to be profound.</P>
<P>Here I determined the&s;e unfortunate wretches &s;hould find a &s;epulchre; and having, by means of a rope, which I formed with a block into a &s;ort of tackle drawn each mi&s;erable carca&s;s to the edge of one of the ports, I let it down as gra|dually as I could, followed it with my eyes till they were dimmed with tears, and then repeating a &s;hort requiem, bid it an earthly adieu.</P>

my view. I then fell upon my knees, put up a fervent prayer for their everla&s;t|ing felicity, and followed it with a thank&s;|giving for my own miraculous pre&s;erva|tion. After this a ray of comfort beamed acro&s;s my mind, which I &s;hall never for|get; and, though I could not help pitying from my &s;oul all tho&s;e poor wretches, who had vainly enterprized for &s;o much trea|&s;ure, yet &s;o impul&s;ive is the vanity of hu|man nature, that my mind would, for a moment, admit no other con&s;ideration than that it was &s;ent to me as a recom|pen&s;e for &s;o much re&s;ignation in &s;o many alarming trials.</P>
<P>The radiant &s;un was now ha&s;tening to hide his le&s;&s;ening beams within the glow|ing ocean. Being, therefore, heartily fa|tigued, and having, be&s;ides, little oppor|tunity to explore what fortune had &s;ent me that evening, I contented my&s;elf with examining the pur&s;er's cabin for refre&s;h|ment,
<PB N="247" REF="252">
where I found a ca&s;e of cordials, &s;ome bi&s;cuits, and other things; and hav|ing &s;paringly refre&s;hed my&s;elf with what I thought would be&s;t agree with me, and determined to &s;tay till morning, I changed my &s;trange weeds for &s;ome night cloaths of Madame D'Oliviere, and went to &s;leep for the fir&s;t time during eleven months in a bed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP VIII. GOOD FORTUNE PRESENTS HANNAH WITH ONE STORE AFTER ANOTHER, OF ALL WHICH SHE IS DEPRIVED, IN A SINGLE MOMENT, BY A FATAL ACCIDENT.</HEAD>
<P>I WAKED with the day, which aro&s;e with a garb as pearly and delicate as that was crim&s;on and grand, in which the former had &s;et. My fir&s;t wi&s;h was to have a di&s;h of tea, which I knew I could ea&s;ily get. I, therefore, went to the galley, kindled a fire, by means of a pi&s;tol tinder box, and while it was burning, I returned through the rock to my brook, and coming back &s;et on my kettle. It is
<PB N="249" REF="254">
inconceivable how the&s;e familiar objects delighted my mind. The contra&s;t was &s;o directly oppo&s;ite to the inconveniences I had been accu&s;tomed to experience, that no plea&s;ure could be much more perfect than was mine at this moment.</P>
<P>Having breakfa&s;ted I began to ex|amine my wealth, I plainly perceived that I had lo&s;t much of the private &s;tock which the officers and pa&s;&s;engers had lain in for their own convenience. To make me amends, however, the pur&s;er's &s;tore-room, the &s;lop-room, and every other part, where the &s;ub&s;tantial materials for food and cloth|ing are always depo&s;ited, were perfectly &s;afe, nor were any articles, except tho&s;e which &s;alt water can &s;poil, materially in|jured. I found plenty of &s;alt beef, dried tongues, hams, potted &s;i&s;h, portable &s;oup, and many other articles in high perfection, and though the wet had peri&s;hed a great
<PB N="250" REF="255">
deal of the bu&s;cuit, I got from fir&s;t to la&s;t more than three hundred weight that was very good.</P>
<P>Flour, Indian wheat, rice, barley, po|tatoes, and a great choice of oriental &s;eeds, I found in abundance, mo&s;t of which, ex|cept part of the flour, was in a pretty good condition. Several forts of wine, particu|larly &s;ome cape wine, and two pipes of Madeira, were al&s;o as good as ever; be|&s;ides the&s;e, in the different cabins I found cordials, &s;weetmeats, &s;pices, and almo&s;t every delicacy that the Ea&s;tern world af|fords; and now having a &s;tock of nece&s;|&s;aries, that, with care, would la&s;t me for many years, and by cultivation, procure me enough for many more, I proceeded to &s;ee what merchandize I was in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of.</P>
<P>Among an a&s;toni&s;hing number of other things, bales of cottons, mu&s;lins, ginghams,
<PB N="251" REF="256">
&s;hawls, and ornamental paper pre&s;ented them&s;elves to my view. Tea I found in plenty, but the greate&s;t part of that in the che&s;ts was damaged. The private &s;tock was, however, in general, &s;o well &s;ecured that it had taken no harm; but what plea&s;ed me mo&s;t, was the carpenter's che&s;t, the ma&s;ter's, and the doctor's. In the fir&s;t I found whatever tools I might &s;tand in need of; in the &s;econd were &s;everal ca&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> of in&s;truments for the purpo&s;e of naviga|tion; and in the third were medicines and phy&s;ical books, together with chirurgical in&s;truments. I had &s;carcely got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ma&s;ter's che&s;t but I took an ob&s;er|vation, and finding my&s;elf in the latitude of thirteen degrees, eighteen minutes &s;outh, I concluded I was upon one of the Co|mora I&s;lands.</P>
<P>In the che&s;t al&s;o, of different indivi|duals, I found colours, chemical compo&s;i|tions, be&s;ides china, and uten&s;ils of various
<PB N="252" REF="257">
kinds out of all calculation. In &s;hort, every thing that is u&s;ually to be found in a French homeward bound Ea&s;t India|man, was now in my exclu&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, for the papers, particularly &s;everal jour|nals of the officers, which were all written in French, informed me that the name of this &s;hip was the Entrepreneur, and that &s;he was bound from Rajapore to Bour|deaux.</P>
<P>This &s;urvey, which was attended with a good deal of fatigue, la&s;ted me &s;ix or eight hours, after which I proceeded to convey into my cavern what I might mo&s;t &s;tand in need of; and, to be brief, for it would be endle&s;s and irk&s;ome to the rea|der, beyond idea, to go over particulars, in about ten days, all which time, as the weather was fair, I &s;lept aboard, I had got together more articles, both for utility and plea&s;ure, than I &s;tood a chance of wanting as long as I &s;hould live.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="258">
A true mortal, my ideas enlarged with my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and that chamber which I had hailed with awful veneration, which had afforded me an a&s;&s;ylum, like the cell of a &s;aint, I now con&s;idered as no place for one of my towering expectations. It was dreary, cold, and inconvenient in moi&s;t weather, and reflected &s;uch a humid gleam when the &s;un &s;hone powerfully, that I not only determined to have recour&s;e to it for culinary and other hou&s;ehold pur|po&s;es alone, but I re&s;olved to build me a new habitation, con&s;i&s;ting of different apartments, on the lawn before the cavern.</P>
<P>To effect this I conveyed piece meal into the cavern, a large number of &s;pare yards, cap&s;tern bars, hand&s;pecks, marlin|&s;pikes, and other u&s;eful pieces of timbers, together with an entire new &s;uit of &s;ails, which were &s;towed away in the hold, be|&s;ides hoops, &s;taves, a framed cap&s;tern, blocks, the machinery of a chain pump,
<PB N="254" REF="259">
and innumerable other articles. My next determination was to uncopper the &s;hip, for which purpo&s;e I con&s;tructed a &s;wing|ing &s;caffold, and &s;u&s;pending it occa&s;ionally from the chains, or other prominent parts of the hull, I got, in the cour&s;e of three days, a prodigious quantity of copper; but, as this &s;eems a work not only beyond the &s;trength but the ingenuity of any indivi|dual, le&s;t I &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected of exag|geration, I &s;hall minutely explain the na|ture of my operations.</P>
<P>The principle of a tackle is extremely well known to &s;eamen, and to them it will not &s;eem extraordinary that I &s;hould be able to hoi&s;t and lower ten times the weight that I could have managed by my proper &s;trength, through the means of &s;uch an engine, e&s;pecially as I had all &s;orts of ropes and blocks ready at hand for my purpo&s;e. I have &s;een three &s;eamen bow&s;e a pipe of Madeira into the Gro&s;ve|nor,
<PB N="255" REF="260">
from the waters edge, which mu&s;t, at lea&s;t, have been twenty feet perpendicular, and that pipe of Madeira mu&s;t have weighed twelve hundred weight; but this is but a trifling in&s;tance, for any one who knows the doctrine of nautical mechanics, will join with me in allowing that ten times more than this is practicable from a large complication of pullies, &s;o placed as to a&s;&s;i&s;t the purcha&s;e of one another.</P>
<P>As to my &s;winging &s;caffold, nothing could be more &s;imple nor more &s;ecure than it was. I got &s;ome of the nettings under the bow&s;prit, and fixed it to a bot|tom of wood, about two foot &s;quare. This enclo&s;ed me as in a cage, or to give a more familiar idea, exactly like a cab|bage net with a wooden bottom. The top of this net, or cage, I fa&s;tened to a block with one pulley, from whence went a rope to another block with two pullies, and the block at bottom, being fixed to that at
<PB N="256" REF="261">
top, in a working &s;tate, I could hoi&s;t or lower my&s;elf at plea&s;ure, always taking care &s;afely to belay my rope when I found my&s;elf in the de&s;ired &s;ituation to go on with my work. Thus I loaded my cage with copper; and when it contained a &s;uf|ficient quantity, I ran my&s;elf up, unladed, then lowered and went to work again.</P>
<P>I could not refrain from going into this explanation, becau&s;e I &s;hould be ex|tremely &s;hocked, if in this work, proba|bility were a &s;ingle moment neglected. Fertile in expedients, as I naturally am; and, indeed, as any one would be in the &s;ame &s;ituation; yet many points in this hi&s;tory may &s;eem extraordinary to tho&s;e determined to doubt, which, through the allowance of a liberal latitude, will only appear a lively ingenuity impelled by ne|ce&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>For three weeks, with very little inter|mi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="257" REF="262">
did I continue this work, by which time I was completely furni&s;hed with every material I could po&s;&s;ibly want. My next ta&s;k was to convey my building ma|terials to the mouth of the cavern; which, with all my contrivance, I began to fear would be utterly impracticable. At la&s;t I determined to accompli&s;h it by means of my framed cap&s;tern, which I fancied I &s;hould find no difficulty in &s;etting up at every turning, and &s;o gradually draw what I plea&s;ed to any given point upon the principal of warping a &s;hip.</P>
<P>As I had &s;ome fear le&s;t a &s;udden hur|ricane might again remove the wreck from its pre&s;ent &s;ituation, or &s;hatter it to pieces, I was now determined to content my&s;elf with what was in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and run no further ri&s;ks. Curio&s;ity, however, or rather fate impelled me to pay the &s;hip another vi&s;it, to examine whether there was
<PB N="258" REF="263">
any thing further that might be of u&s;e to me.</P>
<P>Having penetrated into the bottom of the hold, I looked at a variety of things; but I had &s;o many duplicates of them, and grew &s;o anxious to &s;et about my grand plan, that I was coming away re&s;olved to &s;earch no further; when, all of a &s;ud|den, I &s;aw &s;omething gli&s;ten, and going up to examine what it was, gue&s;s my a&s;to|ni&s;hment, reader, at finding the name of John Hewit &s;tudded upon a che&s;t in &s;mall bra&s;s nails! My very blood froze within me, the place &s;wam round with me, and I fell with violence to the ground, and &s;o near the hole into which I had preci|pitated the dead bodies, that it was a mira|cle I had not fallen into it.</P>
<P>How long I lay deprived of life I know not: but when I recovered my &s;en&s;es, and with them the recollection that
<PB N="259" REF="264">
my hopes and apprehen&s;ions concerning my hu&s;band when the &s;hip was ca&s;t away, were but too true, I &s;creamed aloud, tore my hair, and acted the part of a bedlamite. In this extremity, not con&s;idering how cautiou&s;ly I ought to have &s;tept from plank to plank, my foot &s;lipt, and I fell through a hole in the bows into a hollow of the rock, not le&s;s than a di&s;tance of eighteen feet; and if I had not, as it were by in&s;tinct, caught hold of a rope in my fall, I mu&s;t have been inevitably da&s;hed to pieces.</P>
<P>Now was my &s;tate deplorable indeed! I was &s;hut out in one moment from all that comfort which I had &s;o completely in my power. By one fatal in&s;tance of imprudent curio&s;ity, I not only lo&s;t all that could make life endurable, but come to the knowledge of that which made me regret the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of life it&s;elf. In
<PB N="260" REF="265">
that &s;ituation I lifted up my &s;treaming eyes to Heaven and mo&s;t earne&s;tly im|plored &s;ome pitying power to take my life to ea&s;e my affliction.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP IX. HANNAH LOSES SIGHT OF ALL HOPE AND EXPEC|TATION; AND, AT LENGTH, HER LIFE IS ME|NACED BY A DANGER FROM WHICH NOTHING LESS THAN A MIRACLE COULD HAVE PRESERVED HER.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN my grief had a little &s;ub&s;ided, I looked mo&s;t piteou&s;ly around me; and as recollection &s;ucceeded to &s;tupefaction, I blamed my own ambitious pride for all that had befallen me. Had I been con|tented with the nece&s;&s;aries of life, without panting for luxuries, I might have borne my &s;ituation, &s;ad as it was, with re&s;igna|tion and fortitude, and glided through ex|i&s;tence, though a forgotten, yet an inof|fen&s;ive
<PB N="262" REF="267">
&s;ufferer. Now, through my pride, my folly, and my indi&s;cretion, I was not only fated to peri&s;h in &s;ight of plenty, but my la&s;t moments were to be embittered with the torture of reflection.</P>
<P>I next upbraided my&s;elf with having dared to repine after &s;o many &s;olemn vows to the contrary; and though my eyes &s;till were traitors to my promi&s;es, I would not &s;uffer my heart to acknowledge the trea|&s;on. I, therefore, brui&s;ed as I was, looked about me to &s;ee if I could regain the &s;hip, but, alas, I too fatally &s;aw it was impo&s;&s;i|ble. The rope which had &s;o miraculou&s;ly pre&s;erved me, at its length, would not have reached within ten feet of the ground; but, unluckily, on my quitting it, it had receded and twirled in a kink round a &s;hattered piece of the cathead, and as to any other means they were impracticable.</P>
<P>The bows of the &s;hip lay as in a cradle
<PB N="263" REF="268">
over a prominence, which was wor&s;e than perpendicular, it was oblique, the ba&s;e bending inward; and to get beyond it on either &s;ide was utterly impo&s;&s;ible; for had I fallen only a few paces any way from where I happened to alight. The di&s;tance from the &s;hip mu&s;t have been thirty yards, therefore, my pre&s;ervation was every way providential.</P>
<P>When I reflected on this a faint glim|mer of hope again revived in my mind. I might by &s;ome other pa&s;&s;age regain my cavern; I might in my way make &s;ome u&s;eful di&s;covery; nay, I might again vi&s;it the fatal che&s;t, and agreeably undeceive my&s;elf. John Hewit was a very common name, and it might belong to &s;omebody el&s;e and not my hu&s;band. Nay, even if it were his, he might have &s;old it after hav|ing no further u&s;e for it; for, after all, what could be &s;o unlikely as that he who was &s;o excellent an Engli&s;h &s;ailor &s;hould belong to a French &s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="269">
With the&s;e fond and weak, but con|&s;olatory ideas, with which hope &s;eldom fails to flatter mi&s;ery, did I cheer my|&s;elf till I had called into action a portion of my wonted fortitude. It being yet early in the day, I thought by per&s;everance I might get round the bottom of the rock and &s;o make &s;ome di&s;covery of importance before night &s;hould overtake me, tru&s;ting to chance as to what wild fruit I might find in my way to eke out the &s;mall por|tion of bu&s;cuit which, by good fortune, I happened to have in my pocket, and from what chry&s;tal &s;pring I might quench my thir&s;t.</P>
<P>With a heavy heart did I crawl and clamber from one craggy point to another, taking that direction which I con&s;idered as mo&s;t likely to lead me round to my ha|bitation. The further I ventured, how|ever, the more I got a&s;tray, no ve&s;tige of any known object pre&s;ented it&s;elf to my view; on the contrary, my journey was
<PB N="265" REF="270">
retarded by dangerous breaks, overgrown with brambles, in which it required the utmo&s;t judgment to avoid being enthralled.</P>
<P>I had wandered about in this hopele&s;s and forlorn condition for &s;everal hours, &s;ometimes directing my way towards the place of my de&s;tination, and &s;ometimes meeting with ob&s;tructions that obliged me to take a contrary direction, when getting into a kind of irregular valley, tremen|dou&s;ly ridged with rocks on each &s;ide, and &s;loping towards the &s;ea, I determined to &s;ee where it would lead, in the hope that I &s;hould at the bottom of it regain the ridge of rocks on the &s;hore, which, though it would be a work of infinite labour, would, in the end, lead me to my cavern.</P>
<P>This valley led me to an exten&s;ive lawn covered with the mo&s;t beautiful verdure, and planted, as if with &s;ome human hand, with clumps of orange, citron, and a pro|digious
<PB N="266" REF="271">
variety of other oriental fruit trees. At the back, which received the full &s;outh &s;un, a ridge of rocks ran nearly in the form of an amphitheatre, while vines of all &s;orts twining in great luxuriance interlaced their rugged face. To the we&s;tward, from a cleft in the rock, bur&s;t in a large volume a beautiful ca&s;cade, which being regorged from the &s;i&s;&s;ures, it perforated and bounded with redoubled force over the craggy pro|minencies, that being thus wa&s;hed, looked like a rich mixture of porphory, marble, granate, and &s;par; it then made its way to the ba&s;e with a mo&s;t maje&s;tic and awful concu&s;&s;ion, and thence ran off in an ample and profound &s;tream, which emptied it&s;elf into a capacious ba&s;on about five hun|dred yards beneath it.</P>
<P>To the ea&s;t a ridge of cedars, cocoa trees, pines, and other Ea&s;tern productions of the large&s;t kind, like a towering wood reached to the very &s;urface of the moun|tain.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="272">
Thus the valley I de&s;cended was nearly in the center of this beautiful lawn, which being fringed round in the manner I have de&s;cribed to the right and left, with ridges of rocks and trees, the whole is an amphi|theatrical form, &s;pread on in a gradual &s;lope to the di&s;tance, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;trait on, of half a mile, and in breadth a mile and a half, the front bounded by a poli&s;hed rock beneath, which at high tide was wa&s;hed by the &s;ea, but which was &s;ituated &s;o high, that the &s;ea &s;eldom or ever wa&s;hed over it.</P>
<P>Struck by the awful grandeur of this beautiful &s;cene, I pau&s;ed and wondered. I could &s;carcely think but that art had combined with nature in forming it. The&s;e were my reflections. Perhaps the i&s;land had been &s;ome time or other inhabited, and that wild bea&s;ts, with which I had received one &s;hocking proof it abounded, had de|voured the inhabitants. Who knew but that &s;ome other part of the Gro&s;venor's
<PB N="268" REF="273">
people might have, like me, found a tem|porary &s;helter, and alas, like me, a devoted grave.</P>
<P>I was in this mood, and had &s;carcely time to eat &s;ome of my bi&s;cuit and drink a little water, when night overtook me. I now crept into a clo&s;e interwoven thicket, and having &s;ecured my&s;elf from all dan|gers in the be&s;t manner I could, I com|mitted my&s;elf to the care of Providence.</P>
<P>I had &s;carcely fallen a&s;leep when I was rou&s;ed by a mo&s;t terrifying noi&s;e, which I too well knew to be the roar of a lion. Heavens what were my feelings at that moment! Annihilation would have been mercy to me. I was convul&s;ed with hor|ror, my whole ma&s;s of blood curdled in my veins; and frantic with de&s;pair, as I knelt with my hands cla&s;ped in agony, I knew not whether my di&s;tracted prayer to Heaven implored death or mercy.</P>
<P><PB N="369" REF="274">
The noi&s;e encrea&s;ed. Twenty lions &s;eemed to be in &s;earch of their prey. At legth it died off, and having li&s;tened with a death like &s;ilence for more than an hour, my mind and body tired out, nature again yielded to repo&s;e, but Oh what a dream en&s;ued.</P>
<P>I dreamt John Hewit came to me all bloody. He told me he had been torne by the jaws of a lion, and begged me to hide him. When I attempted it the lion came and tearing him from me, &s;cattered his limbs upon the plain. I expected to be devoured in my turn, in&s;tead of which the lion lay down before me, fawned on me, and ki&s;&s;ed my feet. In an in&s;tant I lo&s;t it, and being tran&s;ported to a barren wild, I was &s;et upon by thieves. Binns re&s;cued me from their violence; and as I ap|proached him he bade me &s;tand off for that he had married his &s;i&s;ter. What &s;ucceeded was delirium, and I waked ju&s;t after day break in a violent fever.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="275">
Parched with thir&s;t, I tottered, I &s;carcely knew how, towards the verge of the precipice that faced the &s;ea, where I had the day before found &s;ome ripe oranges. When I arrived there I entered a rece&s;s, from whence i&s;&s;ued a mo&s;t delicious odour occa&s;ioned by the orange and citron flow|ers that bloomed every where about me. I gathered &s;everal branches of the&s;e, and di&s;tracted as I yet was with the burning fever, I formed them into wreaths and gar|lands, &s;inging incoherently bits and &s;craps of melancholy ditties.</P>
<P>My intellects, however, were not &s;o impaired but I &s;oon became &s;en&s;ible enough of a danger that &s;eemed to threaten me with inevitable de&s;truction. Getting to the very verge of the rock, over which hung luxuriant branches of the orange trees, loaded at the &s;ame time with fruit and blo&s;&s;oms, I di&s;turbed a mon&s;trous lione&s;s as &s;he was &s;tretched with a cub by her &s;ide. My &s;ituation, in one moment,
<PB N="271" REF="276">
was exactly the &s;ame as that of the hor&s;e in Stubbs's beautiful picture, except that, unlike him, I knew my danger, and there|fore, my blood in&s;tead of filling my veins receded to my heart, and actuated by that knowledge, and, perhaps, my di&s;temper, for nothing is &s;o quick as madne&s;s, I in|&s;tantly meditated how to e&s;cape; but be|fore I could give my dreadful &s;ituation a &s;ingle thought, catching the glow of the mon&s;ter's eye, I was fairly under the power of facination. A moment after I &s;aw her in the act of &s;pringing at me when I mea&s;ured my length upon the ground and died away.</P>
