<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>I AM as ready as the mo&s;t rigid Critic, to confe&s;s, that nothing can be more &s;im|ple and inartificial than the plans of the fol|lowing Dramas. In the con&s;truction of them I have &s;eldom ventured to introduce any per&s;ons <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Never, indeed, except in DANIEL, and that of nece&s;&s;ity; as the Bible furni&s;hes no more than two per|&s;ons, Daniel and Darius; and the&s;e were not &s;ufficient to carry on the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Piece.</NOTE> of my own creation: Still le&s;s did I imagine my&s;elf at liberty to invent cir|cum&s;tances. I reflected, with awe, that <HI>the place whereon I &s;tood was holy ground.</HI> All the latitude I permitted my&s;elf, was, to
<PB N="vi" REF="4">make &s;uch per&s;ons as I &s;elected, act under &s;uch circum&s;tances as I found, and expre&s;s &s;uch &s;entiments as, in my humble judgment, appeared not unnatural to their &s;ituations.&mdash; Some of the &s;peeches are &s;o long as to retard the action; for I rather a&s;pired after moral in&s;truction, than the purity of Dramatic Com|po&s;ition. The very terms of Act and Scene are avoided, becau&s;e I was unwilling to awaken the attention of the Reader to my deficiencies in critical exactne&s;s.</P>
<P>It may be thought that I have cho&s;en, perhaps, the lea&s;t important pa&s;&s;age in the eventful Life of David, for the foundation of the Drama which bears his name. Yet even in this, his fir&s;t exploit, the &s;acred Hi&s;torian repre&s;ents him as exhibiting no mean le&s;&s;on of mode&s;ty, humility, courage,
<PB N="vii" REF="5">and piety: virtues not only admirable, but imitable; and within the reach of every Reader. Many will think that the intro|duction of Saul's daughter would have add|ed to the effect of the piece: and I have no doubt but that it would have made the intrigue more complicated and more inte|re&s;ting, had this Drama been intended for the Stage. There, all that is tender, and all that is terrible in the pa&s;&s;ions, find a proper place. But I write for the Young, in whom it will be always time enough to have them awakened; I write for a cla&s;s of Readers, to whom it is not ea&s;y to accom|modate one's &s;ubject <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It would not be ea&s;y, I believe, to introduce Sacred Tragedies on the Engli&s;h Stage. The &s;crupulous would think it profane, while the profane would think it dull. Yet the excellent RACINE, in a di&s;&s;ipated country, and a voluptuous court, ventured to adapt the &s;tory of <HI>Athaliah</HI> to the French Theatre; and it remains to us a glorious monument of its Author's courageous piety, and of the perfection of the Dramatic Art.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="6">A very judicious and learned friend has remarked, that the <HI>Reflections of King Heze|kiah</HI> breathe rather too much of the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity; for that it is &s;carcely probable he had &s;o &s;ettled a belief in the general judgment. I feel the ju&s;tne&s;s of the objec|tion, without having been able to obviate it. I wi&s;hed to convey a &s;trong idea of this great leading truth, and have, perhaps im|properly, a&s;cribed &s;entiments to a Jewi&s;h monarch, merely becau&s;e I wi&s;hed to im|pre&s;s them on the Chri&s;tian Reader.</P>
<P>The Critic and the Scholar, if any &s;uch &s;hould honour the&s;e pages with their atten|tion
<PB N="ix" REF="7">will find ample matter on which to exerci&s;e their candor and their charity; qua|lities &s;o natural to genius and to learning, that even the feeblene&s;s of my performance will not be able to ob&s;truct the exertion of them in favour of my intention.</P>
<P>The amiable Poet <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cowley.</NOTE> from whom I have taken my motto, after &s;hewing the &s;uperi|ority of the Sacred, over the Profane Hi&s;|tories (&s;ome in&s;tances of which I have no|ticed in my Introduction), concludes with the following remark, which I may apply to my&s;elf with more propriety than it was u&s;ed by the Author:&mdash; <Q>I am far from a&s;&s;uming to my&s;elf, to have fulfilled the duty of this weighty undertaking; and I &s;hall be am|bitious
<PB N="x" REF="8">of no other fruit from this weak and imperfect attempt of mine, but the opening of a way to the courage and in|du&s;try of &s;ome other per&s;ons, who may be better able to perform it thoroughly and &s;ucce&s;sfully.</Q></P>
