<HEAD>THE LIFE OF <HI>MARK AKENSIDE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MARK AKENSIDE, an eminent poet and phy&s;ician, was born at Newca&s;tle upon Tyne the 9th Nov. 1721. He was &s;econd &s;on of Mark Aken&s;ide, a &s;ub&s;tantial butcher of that town: his mother's name was Mary Lum&s;den. At the free&s;chool of Newca&s;tle young Aken&s;ide received the fir&s;t part of his education; he was next committed to the care of Mr. Wil&s;on, a di&s;|&s;enting clergyman who kept a private academy at Newca&s;tle.</P>
<P>About the eighteenth year of his age our Author was &s;ent to the univer&s;ity of Edinburgh, in the view of qualifying him&s;elf for the duties of a Pre&s;byterian pa&s;tor, his parents and relations in general being of the Pre&s;byterian &s;ect. Mr. Aken&s;ide received &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the funds which the Engli&s;h Di&s;&s;enters employ in educating young men of no opulent for|tunes; but his views as to the mini&s;try altering, he bent his &s;tudies towards phy&s;ick, and hone&s;tly repaid to his benefactors the money they had advanced for him, which being contributed for a different purpo&s;e than promoting the &s;tudy of phy&s;ick he thought it di&s;ho|nourable to retain. Whether in relinqui&s;hing his de|&s;ign of being a Di&s;&s;enting clergyman he al&s;o cea&s;ed to be a Di&s;&s;enter is not certainly known.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="6">
Aken&s;ide's genius and ta&s;te for poetry di&s;played them&s;elves early when at Newca&s;tle &s;chool, and du|ring his continuance at Mr. Wil&s;on's academy. His Plea&s;ures of Imagination, with &s;everal other poems, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;aid, were fir&s;t written by him at Morpeth while upon a vi&s;it to his relations, and before he went to the univer&s;ity of Edinburgh, where he al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his poetical compo&s;itions. His Ode on the Winter Sol&s;tice, which is dated 1740, was certainly compo&s;ed at that place.</P>
<P>After three years &s;tudy at Edinburgh Mr. Aken|&s;ide went (1741) to Leyden, where on 16th May 1744 he took his degree of Doctor in Phy&s;ick. Same year appeared his Plea&s;ures of Imagination, a poem which procured him &s;ome emolument and much re|putation. This poem was followed by An Epi&s;tle to Curio, an acrimonious attack on the political con|duct of William Pulteney Earl of Bath, whom he &s;tigmatizes under the name of Curio as the betrayer of his country, al&s;o publi&s;hed in the 1744. Aken&s;ide di&s;&s;atisfied with this performance altered it exceed|ingly: he converted the Epi&s;tle into an Ode, and re|duced it to le&s;s than half the number of lines of which it originally con&s;i&s;ted. In the 1745 he publi&s;hed his fir&s;t Collection of Odes, ten in number. In 1748 came out his Ode to the Earl of Huntingdon; and in 1758 he attempted to rou&s;e the national &s;pirit by An Ode to the Country Gentlemen of England. Few of his re|maining
<PB N="vii" REF="7">
poems were publi&s;hed &s;eparately, excepting the Ode to Thomas Edwards, E&s;q. which though written in 1751 was not printed till the year 1766. The re&s;t of Dr. Aken&s;ide's poems which appeared in his lifetime were given, at lea&s;t for the mo&s;t part, in the &s;ixth volume of Dod&s;ley's Collection.</P>
<P>Soon after his return from Leyden he commenced phy&s;ician at Northampton, where Dr. Stonehou&s;e then practi&s;ed with reputation and &s;ucce&s;s. Whil&s;t here he carried on an amicable debate with Dr. Dod|dridge concerning the opinions of the ancient philo|&s;ophers with regard to a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments, in which Dr. Aken&s;ide &s;upported the firm belief of Cicero in particular in this great article of natural religion. Not meeting with &s;ufficient en|couragement at Northampton, or being ambitious of a larger field in which to di&s;play his talents, he re|moved to Hamp&s;tead, where he re&s;ided upwards of two years, and then finally fixed him&s;elf in London.</P>
<P>At London he was well known as a poet, but had &s;till to force his way as a phy&s;ician. At fir&s;t he had but little practice, and would probably have been reduced to difficulties had not Mr. Dy&s;on, his intimate friend, generou&s;ly allowed him 300<HI>l.</HI> a year, which enabled him to make a proper appearance in the world. In time the Doctor acquired con&s;iderable reputation and practice, and arrived at mo&s;t of the honours incident to his profe&s;&s;ion: he became a Fellow of the Royal
<PB N="viii" REF="8">
Society, a Phy&s;ician to St. Thomas's Ho&s;pital, was ad|mitted by mandamus to the degree of Doctor in Phy|&s;ick in the univer&s;ity of Cambridge, and elected a Fel|low of the Royal College of Phy&s;icians in London, and upon the &s;ettlement of the Queen's hou&s;ehold was appointed one of the Phy&s;icians to her Maje&s;ty. He perhaps might have &s;till ro&s;e to a greater eleva|tion of character had not his &s;tudies ended with his life by a putrid fever 23d June 1770, in the 49th year of his age. He was buried in the pari&s;h of St. James's We&s;tmin&s;ter.</P>
<P>Dr. Aken&s;ide was much devoted to the &s;tudy of ancient literature, and was a great admirer of Plato, Cicero, and the be&s;t philo&s;ophers of antiquity. His knowledge and ta&s;te in this re&s;pect are con&s;picuous in his poems, and in the Notes and Illu&s;trations which he hath annexed to them. That he had a &s;incere re|verence for the great and fundamental principles of religion is apparent from numberle&s;s pa&s;&s;ages in his writings. His high veneration for the Supreme Being, his noble &s;entiments of the wi&s;dom and benevolence of the Divine Providence, and his zeal for the cau&s;e of virtue, are con&s;picuous in all his poems. His re|gard to the Chri&s;tian revelation, and his &s;olicitude to have it pre&s;erved in its native purity, are di&s;played in the Ode to the Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, His attachment to the cau&s;e of civil and religious liberty is a di&s;tin|gui&s;hed feature in the character of his poetical writ|ings:
<PB N="ix" REF="9">
he embraces every occa&s;ion of di&s;playing his ardour concerning this &s;ubject; and two of his Odes, tho&s;e to the Earl of Huntingdon and the Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, are directly con&s;ecrated to it.</P>
<P>Dr. Aken&s;ide is to be con&s;idered as a didactick and lyrick poet. His chief work, The Plea&s;ures of Ima|gination, was received with great applau&s;e, and rai&s;ed the Author's reputation high in the poetical world. Pope, on looking into the manu&s;cript before publica|tion, is reported to have &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"That the Author was no every-day writer."</Q> Mr. Cooper, in his Letters concerning Ta&s;te, &s;peaks of Aken&s;ide in the follow|ing &s;train of commendation: <Q REND="inline">"For my part I am of opinion that there is now living a poet of as genu|ine a genius as this kingdom ever produced, Shake|&s;peare alone excepted. By poetical genius I do not mean the mere talent of making ver&s;es, but that glorious enthu&s;ia&s;m of &s;oul, that fine phren&s;y, in which the poet's <HI>eye rowling glances from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven,</HI> as Shake&s;peare feelingly de&s;cribes it. This alone is poetry; aught el&s;e is a mechanical art of putting &s;yllables harmonicu&s;ly to|gether. The gentleman I mean is Dr. Aken&s;ide, the worthy Author of The Plea&s;ures of Imagination, the mo&s;t beautiful didactick poem that ever adorned the Engli&s;h language."</Q> On the other hand the late Mr. Gray, in a letter to Mr. Wharton of Old Park near Durham, dated Peterhou&s;e 26th April 1744,
<PB N="x" REF="10">
(Ma&s;on's 4to edit. of Gray, p. 178.) &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"You de|&s;ire to know, it &s;eems, what character the poem of your young friend (Dr. Aken&s;ide) bears here. I wonder that you a&s;k the opinion of a nation where tho&s;e who pretend to judge do not judge at all, and the re&s;t (the wi&s;er part) wait to catch the judg|ment of the world immediately above them, that is, Dick's and the Rainbow coffeehou&s;es. Your readier way would be to a&s;k the ladies who keep the bars in tho&s;e two theatres of critici&s;m. However, to &s;hew you that I am a judge as well as my countrymen, I will tell you, though I have rather turned it over than read it, (Plea&s;ures of Imagination) but no mat|ter, no more have they, that it &s;eems to me above the middling, and now and then, for a little while, ri&s;es even to the be&s;t, particularly in de&s;cription. It is often ob&s;cure, and even unintelligible, and too much infected with the Hutchin&s;on jargon. In &s;hort, its great fault is that it was publi&s;hed at lea&s;t nine years too early. And &s;o methinks, in a few words, <HI>a la mode du Temple.</HI> I have very prettily di&s;|patched what perhaps may for &s;everal years have employed a very ingenious man worth fifty of my|&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"As the&s;e ob&s;ervations were ha&s;tily delivered in a private letter, before the poem had been maturely examined, we may be allowed (&s;ay the writers of The Biographia to think them too &s;evere, and to
<PB N="xi" REF="11">
&s;teer a middle cour&s;e between Mr. Gray and Mr. Cooper. The ob&s;curity of The Plea&s;ures of Imagi|nation, when read with attention, will chiefly be found in the allegory of the &s;econd book, which we freely confe&s;s we could never under&s;tand. It might likewi&s;e have been better if the peculiar language of Hutchin&s;on, or rather of Shafte&s;bury, had &s;ome|times been omitted. Neverthele&s;s we cannot but regard it as a noble and beautiful poem, exhibiting many bright di&s;plays of genius and fancy, and hold|ing out &s;ublime views of Nature, Providence, and morality. We concur with Mr. Gray in thinking it was publi&s;hed too early: the Author him&s;elf be|came afterwards of the &s;ame &s;entiment; he was con|vinced that the poem was defective in &s;ome re|&s;pects, and redundant in others."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"That it want|ed revi&s;ion and correction,"</Q> says Mr. Dy&s;on, his editor, <Q REND="inline">"he was &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible; but &s;o quick was the demand for &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive republications, that in any of the intervals to have completed the whole of his corrections was utterly impo&s;&s;ible; and yet to have gone on from time to time in making farther improvements in every new edition would, he thought, have had the appearance at lea&s;t of abu|&s;ing the favour of the publick: he cho&s;e therefore to continue for &s;ome time reprinting it without al|teration, and to forbear publi&s;hing any corrections or improvements until he &s;hould be able at once to
<PB N="xii" REF="12">
give them to the publick complete: and with this view he went on for &s;everal years to review and correct his poem at lei&s;ure, till at length he found the ta&s;k grow &s;o much upon his hands, that de&s;pair|ing of ever being able to execute if &s;ufficiently to his own &s;atisfction he abandoned the purpo&s;e of cor|recting, and re&s;olved to write the poem over anew, upon a &s;omewhat different and an enlarged plan."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Aken&s;ide did not live to fini&s;h the whole of his plan: that part of it which is carried into execution occurs next in this edition, and the reader may judge of the Doctor's intentions by having recour&s;e to the Ge|neral Argument prefixed to the poem. He de&s;igned at fir&s;t to compromi&s;e the whole of his &s;ubject, accord|ing to a new plan, in four books; but he afterwards changed his purpo&s;e, and determined to di&s;tribute The Plea&s;ures of Imagination into a greater number of books. How far his &s;cheme would have carried him, if he had lived to complete it, is uncertain, for at his death he had only fini&s;hed the fir&s;t and &s;econd books, a con&s;iderable part of the third, and the introduction to the fourth. The fir&s;t book of the improved work bears a nearer re&s;emblance to the fir&s;t book of the former editions than any of the re&s;t do to each other: there are neverthele&s;s in this book a great number of correc|tions and alterations, and &s;everal con&s;iderable additi|ons. Dr Aken&s;ide has introduced a tribute of re&s;pect and affection to his friend Mr. Dy&s;on; he has referred
<PB N="xiii" REF="13">
The Plea&s;ures of Imagination to two &s;ources only, Greatne&s;s and Beauty, and not to three, as he had heretofore done: his delineation of beautiful objects is much enlarged; and, upon the whole, the fir&s;t book &s;eems to have received no &s;mall degree of improve|ment. The &s;econd book is very different from the &s;e|cond book of the preceeding editions: the difference indeed is &s;o great that they cannot be compared toge|ther. The Author enters into a di&s;play of Truth and its three cla&s;&s;es, matter of Fact, experimental or &s;cien|tifical Truth, and univer&s;al Truth. He treats likewi&s;e of Virtue, as exi&s;ting in the Divine Mind, of human virtue, of Vice and its origin, of Ridicule, and of the Passions. What he hath &s;aid upon the &s;ubject of ridi|cule is greatly and advantageou&s;ly reduced from what it was in the former copies. The enumeration of the different &s;ources of ridicule is left out, and con&s;equently &s;omelines which had given offence to Dr. Warburton. The allegorical Vi&s;ion which heretofore con&s;tituted a principal part of the &s;econd book is likewi&s;e omitted. The poetical character of the &s;econd book, as it now &s;tands, is, that it is correct, moral, and noble. The third book is an epi&s;ode, in which Solon the Athenian lawgiver is the chief character; and the de&s;ign of it &s;eems to be, to &s;hew the great influence of poetry in enforcing the cau&s;e of Liberty. This part is entirely new, and if it had been fini&s;hed would have proved a beautiful addition to the poem. It is greatly to be re|gretted
<PB N="xiv" REF="14">
that Dr. Aken&s;ide did not live to complete his de&s;ign; neverthele&s;s we &s;hould have been &s;orry to have had the original poem entirely &s;uper&s;eded. What|ever may be its faults there is in it a certain brightne&s;s and brilliancy of imagination, and a certain degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m, which the Doctor did not &s;eem to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in equal vigour in the latter part of his life. Years, and an application to &s;cientifick &s;tudies, appear in &s;ome mea&s;ure to have turned his mind from &s;ound to things, from fancy to the under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on, in his life of Aken&s;ide, &s;ays of this poem, <Q REND="inline">"It has undoubtedly a ju&s;t claim to very par|ticular notice, as an example of great felicity of ge|nius, and uncommon amplitude of acqui&s;itions, of a young mind &s;tored with images, and much exer|ci&s;ed in combining and comparing them."</Q> Of the altered work he adds, <Q REND="inline">"He &s;eems to have &s;omewhat contracted his diffu&s;ion; but I know not whether he has gained in clo&s;ene&s;s what he has lo&s;t in &s;plen|dour."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To The Plea&s;ures of Imagination,"</Q> continue the authors of The Biographia, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ucceed two books of Odes, the fir&s;t containing eighteen, the &s;econd fif|teen odes. It was Dr. Aken&s;ide's intention, if he had lived, to have made each book con&s;i&s;t of twenty odes. Tho&s;e which had been formerly publi&s;hed are greatly altered and improved. The Doctor's odes are not equal to the beautiful productions of
<PB N="xv" REF="15">
Mr Gray, nor perhaps to tho&s;e of one or two living writers; but &s;till there is in them a noble vein of poetry, united with manly &s;en&s;e, and applied to ex|cellent purpo&s;es. This encomium cannot be extend|ed to the whole of the odes without exception: Dr. Aken&s;ide does not always pre&s;erve the dignity of the lyrick Mu&s;e: he is defective in the pathetick even upon a &s;ubject which peculiarly required it, and where it might have been mo&s;t expected, the death of his mi&s;tre&s;s, we mean his Ode to the Even|ing Star. However, his Hymn to Cheerfulne&s;s, and his Odes on leaving Holland, on Lyrick Poetry, to the Earl of Huntingdon, and on Recovering from a &s;it of Sickne&s;s, ju&s;tly entitle him to a place among the principal Lyrick writers of this country."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Of his Odes,"</Q> &s;ays Dr. John&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"nothing fa|vourable can be &s;aid.&mdash;To examine &s;uch compo&s;i|tions &s;ingly cannot be required; they have doubt|le&s;s brighter and darker parts; but when they are once found to be generally dull all further labour may be &s;pared: for to what u&s;e can the work be critici&s;ed that will not be read?"</Q> In this diver&s;ity of opinions the reader will determine for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Dr. Aken&s;ide's principal medical performance was, 1. His Di&s;&s;ertatio de Dy&s;enteria, publi&s;hed in 1764, which has been commended as an elegant &s;pecimen of Latinity: it was twice tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h. He al&s;o wrote, 2. Ob&s;ervations on the Origin and U&s;e of
<PB N="xvi" REF="16">
the Lymphatick Ve&s;&s;els in Animals. 3. An Account of a Blow on the Heart, and its Effects. 4. Oratio Anniver&s;aria, ex In&s;tituto Harveii, in Theatro Col|legii Regalis Modicorum Londinen&s;is habita, Anno 1759. 5. Ob&s;ervations on Cancers. 6. Of the U&s;e of Ipecacuanha in A&s;thmas. 7. A Method of treating White Swellings of the Joints. Be&s;ides the&s;e he read at the College &s;ome Practical Ob&s;ervations made at St. Thomas's Ho&s;pital on the putrid Ery&s;ipelas, which he intended forthe &s;econd volume of The Medical Tran&s;|actions. This paper he carried home with a de&s;ign to correct it, but it was not returned at the time of his death. Being appointed Cronian Lecturer he cho&s;e for his &s;ubject <Q REND="inline">"The Hi&s;tory of the Revival of Learn|ing,"</Q> and read three lectures on it before the College, but from which he &s;oon de&s;i&s;ted, it was &s;uppo&s;ed in di&s;gu&s;t, &s;ome one of the College having objected that he had cho&s;en a &s;ubject foreign to the in&s;titution. Mo&s;t of the above pieces were publi&s;hed in The Phi|lo&s;ophical and Medical Tran&s;actions.</P>

The fir&s;t publication of it was at a very early part of the Author's life; that it wanted revi&s;ion and cor|rection he was &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible; but &s;o quick was the demand for &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive republications, that in any of the intervals to have completed the whole of his corrections was utterly impo&s;&s;ible; and yet to have gone on from time to time in making farther im|provements in every new edition would, he thought, have had the appearance at lea&s;t of abu&s;ing the favour of the publick: he cho&s;e therefore to continue for &s;ome time reprinting it without alteration, and to forbear publi&s;hing any corrections or improvements until he &s;hould be able at once to give them to the publick complete: and with this view he went on for &s;everal years to review and correct his poem at lei&s;ure, till at length he found the ta&s;k grow &s;o much upon his hands, that de&s;pairing of ever being able to execute it &s;uf|ficiently to his own &s;atisfaction he abandoned the
<PB N="18" REF="18">
purpo&s;e of correcting, and re&s;olved to write the poem over anew upon a &s;omewhat different and an enlar|ged plan: and in the execution of this de&s;ign he had made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s. What rea&s;on there may be to regret that he did not live to execute the whole of it will be&s;t appear from the peru&s;al of the plan it&s;elf, as &s;tated in the General Argument, and of the parts which he had executed, and which are here publi&s;h|ed: for the per&s;on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Right Hon.

In this light he con&s;idered the entire fir&s;t and &s;econd books, of which a few copies had been printed for the u&s;e only of the Author and certain friends; al&s;o a very con&s;iderable part of the third book, which had been tran&s;cribed in order to its being printed in the &s;ame manner; and to the&s;e is added the introduction to a &s;ub&s;equent book, which in the manu&s;cript is call|ed the fourth, and which appears to have been com|po&s;ed at the time when the Author intended to com|pri&s;e the whole in four books; but which, as he had afterwards determined to di&s;tribute the poem into more books, might perhaps more properly be call|ed the la&s;t book. And this is all that is executed of

the new work, which although it appeared to the editor too valuable, even in its imperfect &s;tate, to be withholden from the publick, yet (he conceives) takes in by much too &s;mall a part of the original poem to &s;upply its place, and to &s;uper&s;ede the republication of it; for which rea&s;on both the poems are in&s;erted in this Collection.</P>
<P>Of Odes the Author had de&s;igned to make up two books, con&s;i&s;ting of twenty odes each, including the &s;everal odes which he had before publi&s;hed at diffe|rent times.</P>
<P>The Hymn to the Naiads is reprinted from the &s;ixth volume of Dod&s;ley's Mi&s;cellanies, with a few corrections, and the addition of &s;ome Notes.

<HEAD>THE DESIGN.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are certain powers in human nature which &s;eem to hold a middle place between the organs of bo|dly &s;en&s;e and the faculties of moral perception: they have been called by a very general name <Q REND="inline">"The Powers of Imagination."</Q> Like the external &s;en&s;es they re|late to matter and motion, and at the &s;ame time give the mind ideas analogous to tho&s;e of moral approba|tion and di&s;like. As they are the inlets of &s;ome of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Plea&s;ures with which we are acquaint|ed, it has naturally happened that men of warm and &s;en&s;ible tempers have &s;ought means to recal the de|lightful perceptions which they afford, independent of the objects which originally produced them. This gave ri&s;e to the imitative or de&s;igning arts, &s;ome of which, as painting and &s;culpture, directly copy the external appearances which were admired in nature; others, as mu&s;ick and poetry, bring them back to remem|brance by &s;igns univer&s;ally e&s;tabli&s;hed and under&s;tood.</P>
<P>But the&s;e arts as they grew more correct and de|liberate were of cour&s;e led to extend their imitation beyond the peculiar objects of the imaginative powers e&s;pecially poetry, which making u&s;e of language a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the in&s;trument by which it imitates, is con&s;equently become an unlimited repre&s;entative of every &s;peci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> and mode of being; yet as their intention was only to expre&s;s the objects of Imagination, and as they &s;till abound chiefly in ideas of that cla&s;s, they of cour&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> retain their original character, and all the differen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="21" REF="21">
Plea&s;ures which they excite are termed in general Plea&s;ures of Imagination.</P>
<P>The De&s;ign of the following Poem is to give a view of the&s;e in the large&s;t acceptation of the term, &s;o that whatever our Imagination feels from the agreeable appearances of nature, and all the various entertain|ment we meet with either in poetry, painting, mu&s;ick, or any of the elegant arts, might be deducible from one or other of tho&s;e principles in the con&s;titution of the human mind which are here e&s;tabli&s;hed and explained.</P>
<P>In executing this general plan it was nece&s;&s;ary fir&s;t of all to di&s;tingui&s;h the Imagination from our other faculties, and in the next place to characterize tho&s;e original forms or properties of being about which it is conver&s;ant, and which are by nature adapted to it, as light is to the eyes, or truth to the under&s;tanding. The&s;e properties Mr. Addi&s;on had reduced to the three general cla&s;&s;es of Greatne&s;s, Novelty, and Beauty; and into the&s;e we may analyze every object, however complex, which, properly &s;peaking, is delightful to the imagination. But &s;uch an object may al&s;o include many other &s;ources of Plea&s;ure, and its beauty, or no|velty, or grandeur, will make a &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion by rea&s;on of this concurrence. Be&s;ides which the imi|tative arts, e&s;pecially poetry, owe much of their effect to a &s;imilar exhibition of properties quite foreign to the imagination, in&s;omuch that in every line of the mo&s;t applauded poems we meet with either ideas drawn from the external &s;en&s;es, or truths di&s;covered
<PB N="22" REF="22">
to the under&s;tanding, or illu&s;trations of contrivance and final cau&s;es, or, above all the re&s;t, with circum|&s;tances proper to awaken and engage the pa&s;&s;ions; it was therefore nece&s;&s;ary to enumerate and exemplify th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e different &s;pecies of Plea&s;ure, e&s;pecially that from the pa&s;&s;ions, which as it is &s;upreme in the noble&s;t work of human genius, &s;o being in &s;ome particulars not a little &s;urpri&s;ing, gave an opportunity to enliven the didactick turn of the poem by introducing an al|legory to account for the appearance.</P>
<P>After the&s;e parts of the &s;ubject which hold chiefly of admiration, or naturally warm and intere&s;t the mind, a Plea&s;ure of a very different nature, that which ari&s;es from Ridicule, came next to be con&s;idered. As this is the foundation of the comick manner in all the arts, and has been but very imperfectly treated by moral writers, it was thought proper to give it a par|ticular illu&s;tration, and to di&s;tingui&s;h the general &s;ources from which the ridicule of characters is de|rived. Here too a change of &s;tyle became nece&s;&s;ary, &s;uch a one as might yet be con&s;i&s;tent, if po&s;&s;ible, with the general ta&s;te of compo&s;ition in the &s;erious parts of the &s;ubject; nor is it an ea&s;y ta&s;k to give any tolerable force to images of this kind without running eithe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> into the gigantick expre&s;&s;ions of the mock heroick, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> the familiar and poetical raillery of profe&s;&s;ed &s;atire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> neither of which would have been proper here.</P>
<P>The materials of all imitation being thus laid open<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> nothing now remained but to illu&s;trate &s;ome parti|cular
<PB N="23" REF="23">
Plea&s;ures which ari&s;e either from the relations of different objects one to another, or from the nature of imitation it&s;elf. Of the fir&s;t kind is that various and complicated re&s;emblance exi&s;ting between &s;everal parts of the material and immaterial worlds, which is the foundation of metaphor and wit. As it &s;eems in a great mea&s;ure to depend on the early a&s;&s;ociation of our ideas, and as this habit of a&s;&s;ociating is the &s;ource of many Plea&s;ures and pains in life, and on that ac|count bears a great &s;hare in the influence of poetry and the other arts, it is therefore mentioned here, and its effects de&s;cribed: then follows a general account of the production of the&s;e elegant arts, and of the &s;e|condary Plea&s;ure, as it is called, ari&s;ing from the re|&s;emblance of their imitations to the original appear|ances of nature: after which the work concludes with &s;ome reflections on the general conduct of the powers of Imagination, and on their natural and moral u&s;e|fulne&s;s in life.</P>
<P>Concerning the manner or turn of compo&s;ition which prevails in this piece little can be &s;aid with pro|priety by the Author. He had two models; that an|cient and &s;imple one of the fir&s;t Grecian poets, as it is refined by Virgil in the Georgicks, and the familiar epi&s;tolary way of Horace. This latter has &s;everal ad|vantages: it admits of a greater variety of &s;tyle; it more readily engages the generality of readers, as par|taking more of the air of conver&s;ation, and e&s;pecially with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of rhyme leads to a clo&s;er and
<PB N="24" REF="24">
more conci&s;e expre&s;&s;ion. Add to this the example of the mo&s;t perfect of modern poets, who has &s;o happily applied this manner to the noble&s;t parts of philo&s;ophy that the publick ta&s;te is in a great mea&s;ure formed to it alone. Yet, after all, the &s;ubject before us, tend|ing almo&s;t con&s;tantly to admiration and enthu&s;ia&s;m, &s;eemed rather to demand a more open, pathetick, and figured &s;tyle. This too appeared more natural, as the Author's aim was not &s;o much to give formal pre|cepts, or enter into the way of direct argumentation, as by exhibiting the mo&s;t engaging pro&s;pects of na|ture to enlarge and harmonize the Imagination, and by that means in&s;en&s;ibly di&s;po&s;e the minds of men to a &s;imilar ta&s;te and habit of thinking in religion, mo|rals, and civil life. It is on this account that he is &s;o careful to point out the benevolent intention of the Author of Nature in every principle of the human con&s;titution here in&s;i&s;ted on, and al&s;o to unite the mo|ral excellencies of life in the &s;ame point of view with the mere external objects of good ta&s;te; thus recom|mending them in common to our natural propen&s;ity for admiring what is beautiful and lovely. The &s;ame views have al&s;o led him to introduce &s;ome &s;entiment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> which may perhaps be looked upon as not quite di|rect to the &s;ubject; but &s;ince they bear an obvious re+lation to it the authority of Virgil, the faultle&s;s mo+del of didactick poetry, will be&s;t &s;upport him in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> particular: for the &s;entiments them&s;elves he make<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> no apology.</P>

<P>The difficulty in this ca&s;e will be removed if we con&s;ider that, when objects at fir&s;t agreeable lo&s;e that influence by fre|quently recurring, the mind is wholly pa&s;&s;ive and the percep|tion involuntary; but habit on the other hand generally &s;up|po&s;es choice and activity accompanying it; &s;o that the plea|&s;ure ari&s;es here not from the object but from the mind's con|&s;cious determination of its own activity, and con&s;equently in|crea&s;es in proportion to the frequency of that determination.</P>
<P>It will &s;till be urged perhaps that a familiarity with di&s;agree|able objects renders them at length acceptable, even when there is no room for the mind to re&s;olve or act at all: in this ca&s;e the appearance mu&s;t be accounted for one of the&s;e ways:</P>
<P>The plea&s;ure from habit may be merely negative. The ob|ject at fir&s;t gave unea&s;ine&s;s; this unea&s;ine&s;s gradually wears off as the object grows familiar; and the mind finding it at la&s;t en|tirely removed, reckons its &s;ituation really plea&s;ureable com|pared with what it had experienced before.</P>
<P>The di&s;like conceived of the object at fir&s;t might be owing to prejudice or want of attention; con&s;equently the mind be|ing nece&s;&s;itated to review it often may at length perceive its own mi&s;take, and be reconciled to what it had looked on with aver&s;ion; in which ca&s;e a &s;ort of in&s;tinctive ju&s;tice naturally leads it to make amends for the injury by running toward the other extreme of fondne&s;s and attachment.</P>
<P>Or, la&s;ly, though the object it&s;elf &s;hould always continue di&s;agreeable, yet circum&s;tances of plea&s;ure or good fortune may occur along with it: thus an a&s;&s;ociation may ari&s;e in the mind and the object never be remembered without tho&s;e plea|&s;ing circum&s;tances attending it, by which means the di&s;a|greeable impre&s;&s;ion which it at fir&s;t occa&s;ioned will in time be quite obliterated.</P></NOTE></L>

Virtue, for in&s;tance, in the &s;ame re&s;pect as to which we call it good is ever ac|knowledged to be beautiful al&s;o. In the characters of men we always join the two denominations together<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This the Athenians did in a peculiar manner by the words <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">.</NOTE>. The beauty of human bodies corre&s;ponds in like manner with that economy of parts which con&s;titutes them good, and in every circum&s;tance of life the &s;ame object is con&s;tantly ac|counted both beautiful and good, ina&s;much as it an&s;wers the purpo&s;es for which it was de&s;igned." <BIBL><HI>Xenoph. Memorab. Socrat.</HI> lib. iii. cap. 8.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>This excellent ob&s;ervation has been illu&s;trated and extended by the noble re&s;torer of ancient philo&s;ophy. See <BIBL><HI>The Charac|teri&s;ticks,</HI> vol. ii. p. 339 and 422, and vol. iii. p. 181.</BIBL> And an|other ingenious author has particularly &s;hewn that it holds in the general laws of Nature, in the works of art, and the con|duct of the &s;ciences. <BIBL><HI>Inquiry into the Original of our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue,</HI> Treat. i. &s;ect. 8.</BIBL> As to the connexion be|tween beauty and truth, there are two opinions concerning it. Some philo&s;ophers a&s;&s;ert an independent and invariable law in Nature, in con&s;equence of which <Q REND="inline">"all rational beings mu&s;t a|like perceive beauty in &s;ome certain proportions, and defor|mity in the contrary."</Q> And this nece&s;&s;ity being &s;uppo&s;ed the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ame with that which commands the a&s;&s;ent or di&s;&s;ent of the under&s;tanding, it follows of cour&s;e that beauty is founded on the univer&s;al and unchangeable law of truth.</P>
<P>But others there are who believe beauty to be merely a re|lative and arbitrary thing; that indeed it was a benevolent provi&s;ion in Nature to annex &s;o delightful a &s;en&s;ation to tho&s;e objects which are be&s;t and mo&s;t perfect in them&s;elves, that &s;o we might be engaged to the choice of them at once, and with|out having to infer their u&s;efulne&s;s from their &s;tructure and effects; but that it is not impo&s;&s;ible, in a phy&s;ical &s;en&s;e, that two beings of equal capacities for truth &s;hould perceive one of them beauty and the other deformity in the &s;ame propor|tions. And upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, by that truth which is al|ways connected with beauty, nothing more can be meant than the conformity of any object to tho&s;e proportions upon which after careful examination the beauty of that &s;pecies is found to depend. Polycietus, for in&s;tance, a famous ancient &s;culptor, from an accurate men&s;uration of the &s;everal parts of the mo&s;t perfect human bodies deduced a canon or &s;y&s;tem of propor|tions which was the rule of all &s;ucceeding arti&s;ts. Suppo&s;e a &s;tatue modelled according to this, a man of mere natural ta&s;te upon looking at it, without entering into its proportions, confe&s;&s;es and admires its beauty; whereas a profe&s;&s;or of the art applies his mea&s;ures to the head, the neck, or the hand, and without attending to its beauty pronounces the workman|&s;hip to be ju&s;t and true.</P></NOTE></L>

It were ea&s;y by an induction of facts to prove that the Imagination directs al|mo&s;t all the pa&s;&s;ions, and mixes with almo&s;t everycircum&s;tance of action or plea&s;ure. Let any man, even of the colde&s;t head and &s;obere&s;t indu&s;try, analyze the idea of what he calls his In|tere&s;t, he will find that it con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of certain degrees of decency, beauty, and order, variou&s;ly combined into one &s;y|&s;tem, the idol which he &s;eeks to enjoy by labour, hazard, and &s;elfdenial. It is on this account of the la&s;t con&s;equence to re|gulate the&s;e images by the &s;tandard of Nature and the general good, otherwi&s;e the Imagination, by heightening &s;ome objects beyond their real excellence and beauty, or by repre&s;enting others in a more odious or terrible &s;hape than they de&s;erve, may of cour&s;e engage us in pur&s;uits utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the moral order of things.</P>
<P>If it be objected that this account of things &s;uppo&s;es the pa&s;&s;ions to be merely accidental, whereas there appears in &s;ome a natural and hereditary di&s;po&s;ition to certain pa&s;&s;ions, prior to all circum&s;tances of education or fortune, it may be an|&s;wered, that though no man is born ambitious or a mi&s;er, yet he may inherit from his parents a peculiar temper or com|plexion of mind which &s;hall render his Imagination more li|able to be &s;truck with &s;ome particular objects, con&s;equently di&s;po&s;e him to form opinions of good and ill, and entertain pa&s;|&s;ions of a particular turn. Some men, for in&s;tance, by the ori|ginal frame of their minds are more delighted with the va&s;t and magnificent, others, on the contrary, with the elegant and gentle a&s;pects of Nature: and it is very remarkable that the di&s;po&s;ition of the moral powers is always &s;imilar to this of the Imagination; that tho&s;e who are mo&s;t inclined to admire prodigious and &s;ublime objects in the phy&s;ical world are al&s;o mo&s;t inclined to applaud examples of fortitude and heroick virtue in the moral; while tho&s;e who are charmed rather with the delicacy and &s;weetne&s;s of colours, and forms, and &s;ounds, never fail, in like manner, to yield the preference to the &s;ofter &s;cenes of virtue and the &s;ympathies of a dome&s;tick life. And this is &s;ufficient to account for the objection.</P>
<P>Among the ancient philo&s;ophers though we have &s;everal hints concerning this influence of the Imagination upon mo|rals among the remains of the Socratick &s;chool, yet the Stoicks were the fir&s;t who paid it a due attention. Zeno their founder thought it impo&s;&s;ible to pre&s;erve any tolerable regularity in life without frequently in&s;pecting tho&s;e pictures or appearan|ces of things which the Imagination offers to the mind. <BIBL><HI>Diog.

Nay, farther, even when we perceive the turpitude tending to the de&s;truction of its &s;ubject we may &s;till be &s;en&s;ible of a ridiculous appearance till the ruin become imminent, and the keener &s;en&s;ations of pity or terrour bani&s;h the ludicrous appre|hen&s;ion from our minds; for the &s;en&s;ation of ridicule is not a bare perception of the agreement or di&s;agreement of ideas, but a pa&s;&s;ion or emotion of the mind con&s;equential to that perception; &s;o that the mind may perceive the agreement or di&s;agreement, and yet not feel the ridiculous, becau&s;e it is en|gro&s;&s;ed by a more violent emotion. Thus it happens that &s;ome men think tho&s;e objects ridiculous to which others can|not endure to apply the name, becau&s;e in them they excite a much inten&s;er and more important feeling: and this diffe|rence, among other cau&s;es, has brought a good deal of confu|&s;ion into this que&s;tion.</P>

Ridicule is not con|cerned with mere &s;peculative truth or fal&s;ehood. It is not in ab&s;tract propo&s;itions or theorems, but in actions and pa&s;&s;ions, good and evil, beauty and deformity, that we find materials for it; and all the&s;e terms are relative, implying approbation or blame. To a&s;k them whether ridicule be a te&s;t of truth is, in other words, to a&s;k whether that which is ridiculous can be morally true, can be ju&s;t and becoming; or whether that which is ju&s;t and becoming can be ridiculous: a que&s;tion that does not de&s;erve a &s;erious an&s;wer; for it is mo&s;t evident that, as in a me|taphy&s;ical propo&s;ition offered to the under&s;tanding for its a&s;&s;ent, the faculty of rea&s;on examines the terms of the propo&s;ition, and finding one idea which was &s;uppo&s;ed equal to another to be in fact unequal, of con&s;equence rejects the propo&s;ition as a fal&s;ehood: &s;o in objects offered to the mind for its e&s;teem or applau&s;e the faculty of ridicule finding an incongruity in the claim urges the mind to reject it with laughter and contempt. When therefore we ob&s;erve &s;uch a claim obtruded upon man|kind, and the incon&s;i&s;tent circum&s;tances carefully concealed from the eye of the publick, it is our bu&s;ine&s;s, if the matter be of importance to &s;ociety, to drag out tho&s;e latent circum|&s;tances, and by &s;etting them in full view to convince the world how ridiculous the claim is: and thus a double advantage is gained, for we both detect the moral fal&s;ehood &s;ooner than in the way of &s;peculative inquiry, and impre&s;s the minds of men with a &s;tronger &s;en&s;e of the vanity and errour of its authors. And this and no more is meant by the application of ridicule.</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid the practice is dangerous, and may be incon|&s;i&s;tent with the regard we owe to objects of real dignity and excellence. I an&s;wer, the practice fairly managed can never be dangerous: men may be di&s;hone&s;t in obtruding circum|&s;tances foreign to the object, and we may be inadvertent in allowing tho&s;e circum&s;tances to impo&s;e upon us; but the &s;en&s;e of ridicule always judges right. The Socrates of Ari&s;to|phanes is as truly ridiculous a character as ever was drawn:&mdash;true; but it is not the character of Socrates, the divine mo|rali&s;t, and father of ancient wi&s;dom. What then? did the ri|dicule of the poet hinder the philo&s;opher from detecting and di&s;claiming tho&s;e foreign circum&s;tances which he had fal&s;ely introduced into his character, and thus rendered the &s;at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> doubly ridiculous in his turn? No; but it neverthele&s;s had an ill influence on the minds of the people. And &s;o has the rea|&s;oning of Spinoza made many Athei&s;ts: he has founded it in|deed on &s;uppo&s;itions utterly fal&s;e; but allow him the&s;e and his conclu&s;ions are unavoidably true. And if we mu&s;t reject the u&s;e of ridicule becau&s;e by the impo&s;ition of fal&s;e circum|&s;tances things may be made to &s;eem ridiculous which are not &s;o in them&s;elves, why we ought not in the &s;ame manner to reject the u&s;e of rea&s;on, becau&s;e by proceeding on fal&s;e prin|ciples conclu&s;ions will appear true which are impo&s;&s;ible in nature, let the vehement and ob&s;tinate declaimers again&s;t ri|dicule determine.</P></NOTE></L>

<HEAD>THE PLEASURES OF IMAGINATION.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="preface">
<HEAD>The General Argument.</HEAD>
<P>THE Plea&s;ures of the Imagination proceed either from natural objects, as from a flouri&s;hing grove, a clear and murmuring fountain, a calm &s;ea by moonlight, or from works of art, &s;uch as a noble edifice, a mu&s;ical tune, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, a picture, a poem. In treating of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e Plea&s;ures we mu&s;t begin with the former cla&s;s, they being original to the other; and nothing more being nece&s;&s;ary in order to explain them than a view of our natural inclination to|ward greatne&s;s and beauty, and of tho&s;e appearances in the world around us to which that inclination is adapted. This is the &s;ubject of the fir&s;t book of the following poem.</P>
<P>But the Plea&s;ures which we receive from the elegant arts, from mu&s;ick, &s;culpture, painting, and poetry, are much more various and complicated. In them (be&s;ides great|ne&s;s and beauty, or forms proper to the Imagination) we find interwoven frequent repre&s;entations of truth, of vir|tue and vice, of circum&s;tances proper to move us with laughter, or to encite in us pity, fear, and the other pa&s;|&s;ions. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e moral and intellectual objects are de&s;cribed in the &s;econd book, to which the third properly belongs as an epi&s;ode, though too large to have been included in it.</P>
<P>With the abovementioned cau&s;es of Plea&s;ure, which are univer&s;al in the cour&s;e of human life, and appertain to
<PB N="115" REF="115">
our higher faculties, many others do generally concur, more limited in their operation, or of an inferiour origin; &s;uch are the novelty of objects, the a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, af|fections of the bodily &s;en&s;es, influences of education, na|tional habits, and the like. To illu&s;trate the&s;e, and from the whole to determine the character of a perfect ta&s;te, is the argument of the fourth book.</P>
<P>Hitherto the Plea&s;ures of the Imagination belong to the hu|man &s;pecies in general; but there are certain particular men who&s;e Imagination is endowed with powers and &s;u&s;ceptible of Plea&s;ures which the generality of mankind never participate: the&s;e are the men of genius, de&s;tined by Nature to excel in one or other of the arts already men|tioned. It is propo&s;ed therefore in the la&s;t place, to de|lineate that genius which in &s;ome degree appears common to them all, yet with a more peculiar con&s;ideration of poe|try, ina&s;much as poetry is the mo&s;t exten&s;ive of tho&s;e arts, the mo&s;t philo&s;ophical, and the mo&s;t u&s;eful.</P>

Of human virtue, con&s;idered as a &s;y&s;em of particular &s;en|timents and actions, &s;uitable to the de&s;ign of Providence and the con|dition of man, to whom it con&s;titutes the chief good and the fir&s;t beauty.
