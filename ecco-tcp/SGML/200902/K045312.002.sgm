<DIV2 N="13" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. <HI>The practical u&s;es of female knowledge.&mdash; A comparative view of both &s;exes.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE chief end to be propo&s;ed in culti|vating the under&s;tandings of women, is to qualify them for the practical purpo&s;es of life. Their knowledge is not often like the learning of men, to be reproduced in &s;ome literary compo&s;ition, nor ever in any learned profe&s;&s;ion; but it is to come out in conduct. A lady &s;tudies, not that &s;he may qualify her&s;elf to become
<PB N="2" REF="9">an orator or a pleader; not that &s;he may learn to debate, but to act. She is to read the be&s;t books, not &s;o much to enable her to talk of them, as to bring the improvement &s;he derives from them to the rectification of her principles, and the formation of her habits. The great u&s;es of &s;tudy are to enable her to regu|late her own mind, and to be u&s;eful to others.</P>
<P>To woman therefore, whatever be her rank, I would recommend a predominance of tho&s;e more &s;ober &s;tudies, which, not having di&s;play for their object, may make her wi&s;e without vanity, happy without witne&s;&s;es, and content without panegy|ri&s;ts; the exerci&s;e of which will not bring celebrity, but improve u&s;efulne&s;s. She &s;hould pur&s;ue every kind of &s;tudy which will teach her to elicit truth; which will lead her to be intent upon realities; will give preci&s;ion to her ideas; will make an exact mind; every &s;tudy which, in&s;tead of &s;timulating her &s;en&s;ibility, will cha&s;ti&s;e it;
<PB N="3" REF="10">which will give her definite notions; will bring the imagination under dominion; will lead her to think, to compare, to combine, to methodi&s;e: which will confer &s;uch a power of di&s;crimination that her judgment &s;hall learn to reject what is dazzling if it be not &s;olid; and to prefer, not what is &s;triking, or bright, or new, but what is ju&s;t. Every kind of know|ledge which is rather fitted for home con&s;umption than foreign exportation, is peculiarly adapted to women.</P>
<P>It is becau&s;e the &s;uperficial mode of their education furni&s;hes them with a fal&s;e and low &s;tandard of intellectual excellence, that women have &s;ometimes become ridi|culous by the unfounded preten&s;ions of literary vanity: for it is not the really learned but the &s;matterers, who have generally brought their &s;ex into di&s;credit, by an ab&s;urd affectation, which has &s;et them on de&s;pi&s;ing the duties of ordinary life. There have not indeed been wanting (but the character is not common) <HI>pre|cieu&s;es
<PB N="4" REF="11">ridicules,</HI> who, a&s;&s;uming a &s;uperiority to the &s;ober cares which ought to occupy their &s;ex, claim a lofty and &s;upercilious exemption from the dull and plodding drudgeries. Of this dim &s;peck called earth! who have affected to e&s;tabli&s;h an unnatural &s;eparation between talents and u&s;efulne&s;s, in&s;tead of bearing in mind that talents are the great appointed in&s;truments of u&s;eful|ne&s;s; who act as if knowledge were to confer on woman a kind of fanta&s;tic &s;overeignty, which &s;hould exonerate her from female duties; whereas it is only meant the more eminently to qualify her for the performance of them. For a woman of real &s;en&s;e will never forget, that while the greater part of her appro|priate duties are &s;uch as the mo&s;t mode|rately gifted may fulfil with credit, (for Providence never makes that to be very difficult, which is generally nece&s;&s;ary,) yet the mo&s;t highly endowed are equally
<PB N="5" REF="12">bound to perform them; and the humble&s;t of the&s;e offices, performed on Chri&s;tian principles, are whole&s;ome for the minds even of the mo&s;t enlightened, and tend to the ca&s;ting down of tho&s;e high imaginations which women of genius are too much tempted to indulge.</P>
<P>For in&s;tance; ladies who&s;e natural vanity has been aggravated by a fal&s;e education, may look down on <HI>oeconomy</HI> as a vulgar attainment, unworthy of the attention of an highly cultivated intellect; but this is the fal&s;e e&s;timate of a &s;hallow mind. OEconomy, &s;uch as a woman of fortune is called on to practi&s;e, is not merely the petty detail of &s;mall daily expences, the &s;habby curtailments and &s;tinted par&s;imony of a little mind operat|ing on little concerns; but it is the exer|ci&s;e of a &s;ound judgment exerted in the comprehen&s;ive outline of order, of arrangement, of di&s;tribution; of regula|tions by which alone well governed &s;o|cieties, great and &s;mall, &s;ub&s;i&s;t. She who
<PB N="6" REF="13">has the be&s;t regulated mind will, other things being equal, have the be&s;t regu|lated family. As in the &s;uperintendence of the univer&s;e, wi&s;dom is &s;een in its <HI>effects;</HI> and as in the vi&s;ible works of Providence, that which goes on with &s;uch beautiful regularity is the re&s;ult not of chance but of de&s;ign; &s;o that manage|ment which &s;eems the mo&s;t ea&s;y is com|monly the con&s;equence of the be&s;t con|certed plan. A &s;ound oeconomy is a &s;ound under&s;tanding brought into action; it is calculation reali&s;ed; it is the doctrine of proportion reduced to practice; it is fore&s;eeing con&s;equences and guarding again&s;t them; it is expecting contingencies and being prepared for them. The differ|ence is that to a narrow minded vulgar oeconomi&s;t the details are continually pre&s;ent; &s;he is overwhelmed by their weight, and is perpetually be&s;peaking your pity for her labours and your prai&s;e for her exertions: &s;he is afraid you will not &s;ee how much &s;he is hara&s;&s;ed. Little
<PB N="7" REF="14">events, and trivial operations engro&s;s her whole &s;oul; while a woman of &s;en&s;e, hav|ing provided for their probable recurrence, guards again&s;t the inconveniences, without being di&s;concerted by the ca&s;ual ob&s;truct|ions which they offer to her general &s;cheme.</P>
<P>Superior talents however are not &s;o common, as, by their frequency, to offer much di&s;turbance to the general cour&s;e of human affairs; and many a lady who tacitly accu&s;es her&s;elf of neglecting her ordinary duties becau&s;e &s;he is a <HI>genius,</HI> will perhaps be found often to accu&s;e her|&s;elf as unju&s;tly as good St. Jerome, when he laments that he was beaten by the Angel for being too Ciceronian in his &s;tyle <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Owen.</NOTE></P>
<P>But the truth is, women who are &s;o puffed up with the conceit of talents as to neglect the plain duties of life, will not be found to be women of the be&s;t abilities. And here may the author be allowed the
<PB N="8" REF="15">gratification of ob&s;erving, that tho&s;e women of real genius and exten&s;ive know|ledge, who&s;e friend&s;hip have conferred honour and happine&s;s on her own life, have been in general eminent for oeconomy, and the practice of dome&s;tic virtues.</P>
<P>A romantic girl with an affectation of &s;entiment, which her &s;till more ignorant friends mi&s;take for genius, (for in the empire of the blind the one-eyed are kings,) and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;omething of a natural ear, has perhaps in her childhood exhau&s;ted all the images of grief, and love, and fancy, picked up in her de&s;ultory poetical reading in an elegy on a &s;ick linnet or a dead lap-dog; &s;he begins thenceforward to be con&s;idered as a prodigy in her little circle; &s;urrounded with flatterers, &s;he has no opportunity of getting to know that her fame is derived not from her powers, but her po&s;ition; and that when an im|partial critic &s;hall have made all the nece&s;&s;ary deductions, &s;uch as that&mdash;&s;he is a neighbour, that &s;he is a relation, that
<PB N="9" REF="16">&s;he is a female, that &s;he is young, that &s;he has had no advantages, that &s;he is pretty perhaps&mdash;when her ver&s;es come to be &s;tripped of all their extraneous append|ages, and the fair author is driven off her 'vantage-ground of partiality, &s;ex, and favour, &s;he will commonly &s;ink to the level of ordinary capacities; while tho&s;e quieter women, who have meekly &s;at down in the humbler &s;hades of pro&s;e and prudence, by a patient per&s;everance in rational &s;tudies, ri&s;e afterwards much higher in the &s;cale of intellect, and acquire a &s;tock of &s;ound knowledge for far better purpo&s;es. And, though it may &s;eem a contradiction, yet it will generally be found true, that girls who take to &s;cribbling are the lea&s;t &s;tudious. They early acquire a fal&s;e confidence in their own una&s;&s;i&s;ted powers; it becomes more gratifying to their natural vanity to be always pouring out their minds on paper, than to be pouring into them fre&s;h ideas from richer &s;ources.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="17">They pant for the unmerited prai&s;e of fancy and of genius, while they di&s;dain the commendation of judgment, knowledge, and per&s;everance, which is within their reach. To extort admiration they are accu&s;tomed to boa&s;t of an impo&s;&s;ible rapi|dity of compo&s;ing; and while they in|&s;inuate how little time their performances co&s;t them, they intend you &s;hould infer how perfect they might have made them had they conde&s;cended to the drudgery of application. But in&s;tead of extolling the&s;e effu&s;ions for their facility, it would be kind in their friends to blame them for their crudene&s;s; and when the young pretenders are eager to prove in how &s;hort a time &s;uch a poem has been &s;truck off; it would be well to regret that they had not either taken a longer time, or forborne from writing at all; as in the former ca&s;e the work would have been le&s;s defective, and in the latter the writer would have di&s;covered more humility and &s;elf-di&s;tru&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="18">A general capacity for knowledge, and the cultivation of the under&s;tanding at large, will always put a woman into the be&s;t &s;tate for directing her pur&s;uits into tho&s;e particular channels which her de&s;tin|ation in life may afterwards require. But &s;he &s;hould be carefully in&s;tructed that her talents are only a means to a &s;till higher attainment, and that &s;he is not to re&s;t in them as an end; that merely to exerci&s;e them as in&s;truments for the acqui&s;ition of fame and the promoting of plea&s;ure, is &s;ubver&s;ive of her delicacy as a woman, and contrary to the &s;pirit of a Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>Study, therefore, is to be con&s;idered as the means of &s;trengthening the mind, and of fitting it for higher duties, ju&s;t as exer|ci&s;e is to be con&s;idered as an in&s;trument for &s;trengthening the body for the &s;ame end. And the valetudinarian who is religious in the ob&s;ervance of his daily rides to promote his health, and re&s;ts in that as an end, without &s;o much as in|tending to make his improved health
<PB N="12" REF="19">an in&s;trument of increa&s;ed u&s;efulne&s;s, acts on the &s;ame low and &s;elfi&s;h principle with her who reads merely for plea&s;ure and for fame, without any de&s;ign of devoting the more invigorated mind to the glory of the Giver.</P>
<P>But there is one <HI>human</HI> con&s;ideration which would perhaps more effectually tend to damp in an a&s;piring woman the ardours of literary vanity (I &s;peak not of real genius) than any which &s;he will derive from motives of humility, or propriety, or religion; which is, that in the judgment pa&s;&s;ed on her performances, &s;he will have to encounter the mortifying circum&s;tance of having her &s;ex always taken into ac|count, and her highe&s;t exertions will probably be received with the qualified approbation, <HI>that it is really extraordinary for a woman.</HI> Men of learning, who are naturally apt to e&s;timate works in pro|portion as they appear to be the re&s;ult of art, &s;tudy, and in&s;titution, are apt to con|&s;ider even the happier performances of the
<PB N="13" REF="20">other &s;ex as the &s;pontaneous productions of a fruitful but &s;hallow &s;oil; and to give them the &s;ame &s;ort of pra&s;&s;e which we be&s;tow on certain &s;allads, which often draw from us a &s;ort of wondering com|mendation; not indeed as being worth much in them&s;elves, but becau&s;e by the lightne&s;s of the earth, and a happy knack of the gardener, the&s;e indifferent cre&s;&s;es &s;pring up in a night, and therefore one is ready to wonder they are no wor&s;e.</P>
<P>As to men of &s;en&s;e they need be the le&s;s inimical to the improvement of the other &s;ex, as they them&s;elves will be &s;ure to be gainers by it; the enlargement of the female under&s;tanding being the mo&s;t likely means to put an end to tho&s;e petty cavils and contentions for equality which female &s;matterers &s;o anxiou&s;ly maintain. I &s;ay &s;matterers, for between the fir&s;t cla&s;s of both &s;exes the que&s;tion is much more rarely agitated; co-operation and not competition is indeed the clear principle we wi&s;h to &s;ee reciprocally adopted by
<PB N="14" REF="21">tho&s;e higher minds which really approxi|mate the neare&s;t to each other. The more a woman's under&s;tanding is im|proved, the more obviou&s;ly &s;he will di&s;cern that there can be no happine&s;s in any &s;ociety where there is a perpetual &s;truggle for power; and the more her judgment is rectified, the more accurate views will &s;he take of the &s;tation &s;he was born to fill, and the more readily will &s;he accommodate her&s;elf to it; while the mo&s;t vulgar and ill-informed women are ever mo&s;t inclined to be tyrants, and tho&s;e always &s;truggle mo&s;t vehemently for power, who would not fail to make the wor&s;t u&s;e of it when attained. Thus the weake&s;t rea&s;oners are always the mo&s;t po&s;itive in debate; and the cau&s;e is obvious, for <HI>they</HI> are unavoid|ably driven to maintain their preten&s;ions by violence who want arguments and rea&s;ons to prove that they are in the right.</P>
<P>There is this &s;ingular difference between a woman vain of her wit, and a woman
<PB N="15" REF="22">vain of her beauty, that the beauty while &s;he is anxiou&s;ly alive to her own fame, is often indifferent enough about the beauty of other women; and provided &s;he her&s;elf is &s;ure of your admiration, &s;he does not in&s;i&s;t on your thinking that there is ano|ther hand&s;ome woman in the world: while &s;he who is vain of her genius, more liberal at lea&s;t in her vanity, is jealous for the honour of her whole &s;ex, and contends for the equality of their preten&s;ions, in which &s;he feels that her own are involved. The beauty vindicates her own rights, the wit the rights of women; the beauty fights for her&s;elf, the wit for a party; and while &s;he more moderate beauty would but be Queen for life, the wit &s;truggles to abrogate the Salique law of intellect, and to enthrone a whole &s;ex of Queens.</P>
<P>At the revival of letters in the &s;ixteenth and the following century, the controver&s;y
<PB N="16" REF="23">about this equality was agitated with more warmth than wi&s;dom; and the proce&s;s was in&s;tituted and carried on, on the part of the female complainant, with an acri|mony which always rai&s;es a &s;u&s;picion of the ju&s;tice of any cau&s;e. The novelty of that knowledge which was then bur&s;ting out from the dawn of a long night, kindled all the ardours of the female mind, and the ladies &s;ought zealou&s;ly for a portion of that renown which the reputation of learning was beginning to be&s;tow. Be&s;ides their own pens, they had for their advocates all tho&s;e needy authors who had any thing to hope from their power, their riches, or their influence; and &s;o giddy did &s;ome of the&s;e literary ladies become by the adula|tion of their numerous panegyri&s;ts, that through the&s;e repeated draughts of in|ebriating prai&s;e, they grew to de&s;pi&s;e the equality for which they had before con|tended, as a &s;tate below their merit and unworthy of their acceptance. They now &s;corned to litigate for what they already
<PB N="17" REF="24">thought they &s;o obviou&s;ly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and nothing &s;hort of the palm of &s;uperiority was at length con&s;idered as adequate to their growing claims. When court-ladies and prince&s;&s;es were the candidates, they could not long want champions to &s;upport their cau&s;e; by the&s;e champions female authorities were produced as if paramount to facts; quotations from the&s;e female authors were con&s;idered as proofs, and their point-blank a&s;&s;ertions &s;tood for &s;olid rea&s;ons. In tho&s;e para&s;ites who offered this homage to female genius, the homage was therefore the effect neither of truth, nor of ju&s;tice, nor of conviction. It aro&s;e rather out of gratitude, or it was a reciprocation of flattery; it was vanity, it was often di&s;tre&s;s, which prompted the prai&s;e; it was the want of a patrone&s;s. When a lady, and e&s;pecially as it then often happened, when one who was noble or royal &s;at with gratifying docility at the foot of a profe&s;&s;or's chair; when &s;he admired the philo&s;opher, or took upon
<PB N="18" REF="25">her to protect the theologian whom his rivals among his own &s;ex were tearing to pieces, what could the grateful profe&s;&s;or or theologian do le&s;s in return than make the apotheo&s;is of her who had had the penetration to di&s;cern his merit and the &s;pirit to reward it? Thus in fact it was not &s;o much <HI>her</HI> vanity as his own that he was often flattering, though &s;he was the dupe of her more deep and de&s;igning panegyri&s;t.</P>
<P>But it is a little unlucky for the perpe|tuity of that fame which the encomia&s;t had made over to his patrone&s;s, in the never-dying records of his ver&s;es and orations, that in the revolution of a century or two the very names of the flattered are now almo&s;t as little known as the works of the flatterers. <HI>Their memorial is peri&s;hed with them</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Brantome, Pere le Moine, Mon&s;. Thomas, &amp;c.</NOTE>: an in&s;tructive le&s;&s;on, that who|ever be&s;tows, or a&s;&s;umes a reputation di&s;|proportioned to the merit of the claimant,
<PB N="19" REF="26">will find it as little durable as &s;olid. For this literary warfare which engaged &s;uch troops of the &s;econd-hand authors of the age in que&s;tion in &s;uch continual &s;kirmi&s;hes, and not a few pitched battles; which pro|voked &s;o much rancour, &s;o many volumes, and &s;o little wit; &s;o much vanity and &s;o much flattery, produced no u&s;eful or la&s;ting effect. Tho&s;e who promi&s;ed them&s;elves that their names would outlive <Q>one half of round eternity,</Q> did not reach the end of the century in which the boa&s;t was made; and tho&s;e who offered the incen&s;e, and tho&s;e who greedily &s;nuffed up its fumes, are buried in the &s;ame blank oblivion!</P>
<P>But when the temple of Janus &s;eemed to have been clo&s;ed, or at wor&s;t the peace was only occa&s;ionally broken by a &s;light and random &s;hot from the hand of &s;ome &s;ingle &s;traggler; it appears that though open re|bellion had cea&s;ed, yet the female claim had not been renounced; it had only (if we may change the metaphor) lain in
<PB N="20" REF="27">abeyance. The conte&s;t has recently been revived with added fury, and with multi|plied exactions; for whereas the ancient demand was merely a kind of imaginary prerogative, a &s;peculative importance, a mere titular right, a &s;hadowy claim to a few unreal acres of Parna&s;&s;ian territory; the revived contention has taken a more &s;erious turn, and brings forward political as well as intellectual preten&s;ions: and among the innovations of this innovating period, the impo&s;ing term of <HI>rights</HI> has been produced to &s;anctify the claim of our female pretenders, with a view not only to rekindle in the minds of women a pre|&s;umptuous vanity di&s;honourable to their &s;ex, but produced with a view to excite in their hearts an impious di&s;content with the po&s;t which God has a&s;&s;igned them in this world.</P>
<P>But <HI>they</HI> little under&s;tand the true in|tere&s;ts of woman who would lift her from the duties of her allotted &s;tation, to fill with fanta&s;tic dignity a loftier but le&s;s
<PB N="21" REF="28">appropriate niche. Nor do they under|&s;tand her true happine&s;s, who &s;eek to annihilate di&s;tinctions from which &s;he de|rives advantages, and to attempt innova|tions which would depreciate her real value. Each &s;ex has its proper excellencies, which would be lo&s;t were they melted down into the common character by the fu&s;ion of the new philo&s;ophy. Why &s;hould we do away di&s;tinctions which in|crea&s;e the mutual benefits and &s;atisfactions of life? Whence, but by carefully pre|&s;erving the original marks of difference &s;tamped by the hand of the Creator, would be derived the &s;uperior advantage of mixed &s;ociety? Have men no need to have their rough angles filed off, and their har&s;h|ne&s;&s;es and a&s;perities &s;moothed and poli&s;hed by a&s;&s;imilating with beings of more &s;oft|ne&s;s and refinement? Are the ideas of women naturally &s;o very judicious, are their principles &s;o invincibly firm, are their views &s;o perfectly correct, are their judgments &s;o completely exact, that there
<PB N="22" REF="29">is occa&s;ion for no additional weight, no &s;uperadded &s;trength, no increa&s;ed clear|ne&s;s, none of that enlargement of mind, none of that additional invigoration which may be derived from the aids of the &s;tronger &s;ex? What identity could ad|vantageou&s;ly &s;uper&s;ede an enlivening and intere&s;ting variety of character? Is it not then more wife as well as more honourable to move contentedly in the plain path which Providence has obviou&s;ly marked out to the &s;ex, and in which cu&s;tom has for the mo&s;t part rationally confirmed them, rather than to &s;tray awkwardly, unbecomingly, and un&s;ucce&s;sfully, in a forbidden road? to be the lawful po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors of a le&s;&s;er dome&s;tic territory, rather than the turbulent u&s;urpers of a wider foreign empire? to be good originals, rather than bad imitators? to be the be&s;t thing of one's own kind, rather than an inferior thing even if it were of an higher kind? to be excellent women rather than indifferent men?</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="30">Is the author then undervaluing her own &s;ex?&mdash;No. It is her zeal for their true <HI>intere&s;ts</HI> which leads her to oppo&s;e their imaginary <HI>rights.</HI> It is her regard for their happine&s;s which makes her endeavour to cure them of a feveri&s;h thir&s;t for fame. A little Chri&s;tian humility is worth all the wild metaphy&s;ical di&s;cu&s;&s;ion which has un&s;ettled the peace of vain women, and forfeited the re&s;pect of rea&s;on|able men. And the mo&s;t elaborate de|finition of her ideal rights, and the mo&s;t hardy mea&s;ures for attaining them, are of le&s;s value in the eyes of an amiable woman, than <Q>that meek and quiet &s;pirit, which is in the &s;ight of God of great price.</Q></P>
<P>Natural propen&s;ities be&s;t mark the de&s;ignations of Providence as to their application. The fin was not more clearly be&s;towed on the fi&s;h that he &s;hould &s;wim, nor the wing given to the bird that he &s;hould fly, than &s;uperior &s;trength of body and a firmer texture of mind given to
<PB N="24" REF="31">man, that he might pre&s;ide in the deep and daring &s;cenes of action and of council; in government, in arms, in &s;cience, in commerce, and in tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ions which demand a higher reach, and a wider range of powers. The true value of woman is not dimini&s;hed by the imputation of inferiority in <HI>the&s;e</HI> re&s;pects; the has other requi&s;ites better adapted to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of her being, by <Q>HIM who does all things well.</Q></P>
<P>Let her not then view with envy the keen &s;atyri&s;t, hunting vice through all the doublings and windings of the heart; the &s;agacious politician leading &s;enates, and directing the fate of empires; the acute lawyer detecting the obliquities of fraud; and the &s;kilful dramati&s;t expo&s;ing the preten&s;ions of folly: but let her ambi|tion be con&s;oled by reflecting, that tho&s;e who thus excel; to all that Nature be&s;tows and books can teach, mu&s;t add be&s;ides, that con&s;ummate knowledge of the world to which a delicate woman has no fair
<PB N="25" REF="32">avenues, and which could &s;he attain &s;he would never be &s;uppo&s;ed to have come hone&s;tly by.</P>
<P>In almo&s;t all that comes under the de|&s;cription of polite letters, in all that cap|tivates by imagery, or warms by ju&s;t and affecting &s;entiment, women are excellent. They po&s;&s;e&s;s in a high degree that delicacy and quickne&s;s of perception, and that nice di&s;cernment between the beautiful and de|fective, which comes under the denomina|tion of ta&s;te. Both in compo&s;ition and action they excel in details; but they do not &s;o much generalize their ideas as men, nor do their minds &s;eize a great &s;ubject with &s;o large a gra&s;p. They are acute ob|&s;ervers, and accurate judges of life and manners, as far as their own &s;phere of ob|&s;ervation extends; but they de&s;cribe a &s;maller circle. A woman &s;ees the world, as it were, from a little elevation in her own garden, whence &s;he takes an exact &s;urvey of home &s;cenes, but takes not in that wider range of di&s;tant pro&s;pects, which he who &s;tands on a loftier eminence com|mands.
<PB N="26" REF="33">Women often feel what is ju&s;t more in&s;tantaneo&s;ly than they can define it. They have an intuitive penetration into character, be&s;towed on them by Provi|dence, like the &s;en&s;itive and tender organs of &s;ome timid animals, as a kind of natural guard, to warn of the approach of danger beings who are often called to act defen|&s;ively.</P>
<P>In &s;umming up the evidence, if I may &s;o &s;peak, of the different powers of the &s;exes, one may venture, perhaps, to a&s;&s;ert, that women have equal <HI>parts,</HI> but are in|ferior in <HI>wholene&s;s</HI> of mind in the integral under&s;tanding: that though a &s;uperior woman may po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ingle faculties in equal perfection, yet there is commonly a ju&s;ter proportion in the mind of a &s;uperior man: that if women have in an equal de|gree the faculty of fancy which creates images, and the faculty of memory which collects and &s;tores ideas, they &s;eem not to po&s;&s;e&s;s in an equal mea&s;ure the faculty of comparing, combining, analy&s;ing, and &s;epa|rating the&s;e ideas; that deep and patient
<PB N="27" REF="34">thinking which goes to the bottom of a &s;ubject; nor that power of arrangement which knows how to link a thou&s;and con|&s;ecutive ideas in one dependent train, with|out lo&s;ing &s;ight of the original idea out of which the re&s;t grow, and on which they all hang. The female too in her intellectual pur&s;uits is turned a&s;ide by her characteri&s;tic ta&s;tes and feelings. Woman in the career of genius, is the Atalanta, who will ri&s;k lo&s;ing the race by running out of her road to pick up the golden apple; while her male competitor, without, perhaps, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ing greater natural &s;trength or &s;wiftne&s;s, will more certainly attain his object, by being le&s;s expo&s;ed to the &s;eductions of ex|traneous beauty, and will win the race by de&s;pi&s;ing the bait <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What indi&s;po&s;es even rea&s;onable women to con|cede in the&s;e points is, that the weake&s;t man in|&s;tantly lays hold on the conce&s;&s;ion; and, on the mere ground of &s;ex, plumes him&s;elf on his own individual &s;uperiority; inferring, that the fillie&s;t man is &s;uperior to the fir&s;t-rate woman.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="35">Here it may be ju&s;tly enough retorted, that, as it is allowed the education of women is &s;o defective, the alleged inferi|ority of their minds may be accounted for on that ground more ju&s;tly than by a&s;crib|ing it to their natural make. And, indeed, there is &s;o much truth in the remark, that till women &s;hall be more rea&s;onably edu|cated, and till be native growth of their mind &s;hall cea&s;e to be &s;tinted and cramped, we have no ju&s;ter ground for pronouncing that their under&s;tanding has already reach|ed its highe&s;t attainable perfection, than the Chine&s;e would have for affirming that their women have attained to the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible perfection in walking, while the fir&s;t care is, during their infancy, to crip|ple their feet: or rather, till the female &s;ex are more carefully in&s;tructed, this que&s;tion will always remain as undecided as to the <HI>degree</HI> of difference between the under|&s;tandings of men and women, as the que&s;|tion between the under&s;tandings of blacks and whites; for until Africans and Euro|peans
<PB N="29" REF="36">are put nearer on a par in the culti|vation of their minds, the &s;hades of di&s;tinc|tion between their native powers can never be fairly a&s;certained. Thus, though in what relates to the actual difference of mind in the &s;exes, the di&s;tinction it&s;elf &s;eems clearly marked by the defining finger of the Creator, yet of the <HI>degree</HI> of that native difference a ju&s;t e&s;timate can never be formed till the under&s;tandings of wo|men are made the mo&s;t of; till, by &s;uffer|ing their intellectual powers to take the lead of the &s;en&s;itive in their education, their minds &s;hall be allowed to reach to that mea&s;ure of perfection of which they are really &s;u&s;ceptible, and which their Maker intended they &s;hould attain. And when we &s;ee (and who will deny that we &s;ee it frequently?) &s;o many women nobly ri&s;ing from under all the pre&s;&s;ure of a di&s;|advantageous education and a defective &s;y&s;tem of &s;ociety, and exhibiting the mo&s;t unambiguous marks of a vigorous under|&s;tanding, a correct judgment, and a &s;terling piety, it reminds one of tho&s;e &s;hining lights
<PB N="30" REF="37">which have now and then bur&s;t out through all the "darkne&s;s vi&s;ible" of the Romi&s;h church, have di&s;incumbered them|&s;elves from the gloom of ignorance and the fetters of prejudice, and ri&s;en &s;uperior to all the errors of a corrupt theology.</P>
<P>But whatever characteri&s;tical di&s;tinctions may exi&s;t; whatever inferiority may be attached to woman from the &s;lighter frame of her body, the more circum&s;cribed pow|ers of her mind, from a le&s;s &s;y&s;tematic edu|cation, and from the &s;ubordinate &s;tation &s;he is called to fill in life; there is one great and leading circum&s;tance which rai&s;es her importance, and even e&s;tabli&s;hes her equality. <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> has exalted woman to true and undi&s;puted dignity; in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, as there is neither "rich nor poor," "bond nor free," &s;o there is neither <Q>male nor female.</Q> In the view of that immor|tality, which is brought to light by the go&s;pel, &s;he has no &s;uperior. Women (to borrow the idea of an excellent prelate) make up one half of the human race; equally with men redeemed by the blood
<PB N="31" REF="38">of Chri&s;t. In this their true dignity con|&s;i&s;ts; here their be&s;t pretentions re&s;t, here their highe&s;t claims are allowed.</P>
<P>All di&s;putes then for pre-eminence be|tween the &s;exes, have only for their object the precedence of a few &s;hort years, the attention of which would be better devoted to the duties of life and the intere&s;ts of eternity.</P>
<P>And as the final hope of the female &s;ex is equal, &s;o are their pre&s;ent means, per|haps, more favourable, and their opportu|nities, often, le&s;s ob&s;tructed than tho&s;e of the other &s;ex. In their Chri&s;tian cour&s;e women have every &s;uperior advantage, whether we con&s;ider the natural make of their minds, their lei&s;ure for acqui&s;ition in youth, or their &s;ub&s;equently le&s;s expo&s;ed mode of life. Their hearts are naturally &s;oft and flexible, open to impre&s;&s;ions of love and gratitude; their feelings tender and lively: all the&s;e are favourable to the cultivation of a devotional &s;pirit. Yet while we remind them of the benefits they
<PB N="32" REF="39">derive from this frame of mind, they will do well to be on their guard le&s;t this very &s;oftne&s;s and ductility do not lay them more open to temptation.</P>
<P>They have in the native con&s;titution of their minds, as well as from the relative &s;ituations they are called to fill, a certain &s;en&s;e of attachment and dependence, which is peculiarly favourable to religion. They feel, perhaps, more intimately the want of a &s;trength which is not their own. Chri&s;t|ianity brings that &s;uperinduced &s;trength; it comes in aid of their con&s;cious weakne&s;s, and offers the only true counterpoi&s;e to it. "Woman, be thou healed of thy infirmity," is &s;till the heart-cheering language of a gra|cious Saviour.</P>
<P>Women al&s;o bring to the &s;tudy of Chri&s;t|ianity fewer of tho&s;e prejudices which per&s;ons of the other &s;ex too often contract early. Men, from their cla&s;&s;ical education, acquire a &s;trong partiality for the manners of Pagan antiquity, and the documents of Pagan philo&s;ophy; this, together with the
<PB N="33" REF="40">impure taint caught from the loo&s;e de&s;crip|tions of their poets, and the licentious language even of their hi&s;torians, (in whom we rea&s;onably look for more gravity,) often weakens the good impre&s;&s;ions of young men, and at lea&s;t confu&s;es their ideas of piety, by mixing them with &s;o much hete|rogeneous matter. Their very &s;pirits are imbued all the week with the impure fol|lies of a depraved mythology; and it is well if even on Sundays they get to hear of the <Q>true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom he has &s;ent.</Q> While women, though &s;trug|gling with the &s;ame natural corruptions, have commonly le&s;s knowledge to unknow, and no &s;chemes to unlearn; they have not to &s;hake off the pride of &s;y&s;tem, and to di&s;incumber their minds from the &s;hackles of favourite theories: they do not bring from the porch or the academy any <Q>op|po&s;itions of &s;cience</Q> to ob&s;truct their reception of tho&s;e pure doctrines taught on the Mount; doctrines which ought to find a readier entrance into minds uninfected
<PB N="34" REF="41">with the pride of the &s;chool of Zeno, or the libertini&s;m of that of Epicurus.</P>
<P>And as women are naturally more affectionate than fa&s;tidious; they are likely both to read and to hear with a le&s;s critical &s;pirit than men: they will not be on the watch to detect errors, &s;o much as to ga|ther improvement; they have &s;eldom that hardne&s;s which is acquired by dealing deeply in books of controver&s;y, but are more inclined to works which quicken the devotional feelings, than to &s;uch as awaken a &s;pirit of doubt and &s;ceptici&s;m. They are le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to con&s;ider the compo&s;i|tions they peru&s;e, as materials on which to ground objections and an&s;wers, than as helps to faith and rules of life. With the&s;e advantages, however, they &s;hould al&s;o bear in mind that their impre&s;&s;ions being often le&s;s abiding, and their rea&s;on le&s;s open to conviction, by means of the &s;trong evidences which exi&s;t in favour of the truth of Chri&s;tianity, <Q>they ought, therefore, to give the more earne&s;t
<PB N="35" REF="42">heed to the things which they have heard, le&s;t at any time they &s;hould let them &s;lip.</Q> Women are al&s;o from their dome&s;tic habits, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of more lei&s;ure and tranquillity for religious pur&s;uits, as well as &s;ecured from tho&s;e difficulties and temptations to which men are expo&s;ed in the tumult of a bu&s;tling world. Their lives are more uniform, le&s;s agitated by the pa&s;&s;ions, the bu&s;ine&s;&s;es, the contentions, the &s;hock of opinions and of intere&s;ts which convul&s;e the world.</P>
<P>If we have denied them the talents which might lead them to excel as lawyers, they are pre&s;erved from the peril of having their principles warped by that too indi&s;|criminate defence of right and wrong, to which the profe&s;&s;ors of the law are ex|po&s;ed. If we &s;hould que&s;tion their title to eminence as mathematicians, they are hap|pily exempt from the danger to which men devoted to that &s;cience are &s;aid to be liable; namely, that of looking for demon|&s;tration on &s;ubjects, which, by their very
<PB N="36" REF="43">nature, are incapable of affording it. If they are le&s;s conver&s;ant in the powers of nature, the &s;tructure of the human frame, and the knowledge of the heavenly bodies, than philo&s;ophers, phy&s;icians, and a&s;tronomers; they are, however, delivered from the error into which many of each of the&s;e have &s;ometimes fallen, from the fatal habit of re&s;ting in &s;econd cau&s;es, in|&s;tead of referring all to the fir&s;t; in&s;tead of making <Q>the heavens declare the glory of God, and proclaim his handy work;</Q> in&s;tead of concluding, when they ob&s;erve, <Q>how fearfully and wonderfully we are made, marvellous are thy works, O Lord, and that my &s;oul knoweth right well.</Q></P>
<P>And let the weaker &s;ex take comfort, that in their very exemptions from privi|leges, which they are &s;ometimes di&s;po&s;ed to envy, con&s;i&s;t their &s;ecurity and their happine&s;s. If they enjoy not the di&s;tinct|ions of public life and dignified offices, do they not e&s;cape the &s;in of mi&s;-employing, and the mortification of being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
<PB N="37" REF="44">from them? If they have no voice in de|liberative a&s;&s;emblies, do they not avoid the re&s;pon&s;ibility attached to &s;uch privileges? Prepo&s;terous pains have been taken to excite in women an unea&s;y jealou&s;y, that their talents are neither rewarded with public honours nor emoluments in life; nor with in&s;criptions, &s;tatues, or mau&s;o|leums after death. It has been ab&s;urdly repre&s;ented to them as a hard&s;hip; that, while they are expected to perform duties, they mu&s;t yet be contented to relinqui&s;h honours, and mu&s;t unju&s;tly be compelled to renounce fame while they mu&s;t labour to de&s;erve it.</P>
<P>But for Chri&s;tian women to act on the low views &s;ugge&s;ted to them by their ill|judging panegyri&s;ts; and to look up with a giddy head and a throbbing heart to honours and renumerations, &s;o little &s;uited to the wants and capacities of an immortal &s;pirit, would be no le&s;s ridiculous than if Chri&s;tian heroes &s;hould look back with
<PB N="38" REF="45">envy on the Pagan rewards of ovations, oak garlands, par&s;ley crowns, and laurel wreaths. The chri&s;tian hope more than reconciles Chri&s;tian women to the&s;e petty privations, by &s;ub&s;tituting a nobler prize for their ambition, <Q>the prize of the high calling of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</Q> By &s;ub&s;tituting, for that popular and fluc|tuating voice, which may cry "Ho&s;anna" and "crucify" in a breath, that <Q>favour of God which is eternal life.</Q></P>
<P>If women &s;hould lament the di&s;advan|tages attached to their &s;ex, that their cha|racter is of &s;o delicate a texture, as to be &s;ullied by the &s;lighte&s;t breath of calumny, and that the &s;tain is indelible; yet are they not led by that very circum&s;tance more in&s;tinctively to &s;hrink from all tho&s;e irregularities to which the lo&s;s of character is &s;o in&s;eparably attached; and, to &s;hun with keener circum&s;pection the mo&s;t di&s;tant approach towards the confines of danger? Let them not lament it as a
<PB N="39" REF="46">hard&s;hip, but enjoy it as a privilege, that the delicacy of their &s;ex impels them more &s;crupulou&s;ly to avoid the very appearance of evil, &s;ince that very nece&s;&s;ity &s;erves to defend their purity by a more deep in|trenchment from the evil it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Though it be one main object of this little work, rather to lower than to rai&s;e any de&s;ire of celebrity in the female heart; yet I would awaken it to a ju&s;t &s;en&s;ibility to hone&s;t fame: I would call on women to reflect that our religion has not only made them heirs to a ble&s;&s;ed immortality hereafter, but has greatly rai&s;ed them in the &s;cale of being here, by lifting them to an importance in &s;ociety unknown to the mo&s;t poli&s;hed ages of antiquity. The re|ligion of Chri&s;t has even be&s;towed a degree of renown on the &s;ex beyond any other reli|gion. Perhaps there are hardly &s;o many vir|tuous women (for I reject the long catalogue whom their vices have transferred from oblivion to infamy) named in all the pages
<PB N="40" REF="47">of Greek or Roman Hi&s;tory, as are hand|ed down to eternal fame, in a few of tho&s;e &s;hort chapters with which the great Apo&s;tle to the Gentiles has concluded his epi&s;tles to his converts. Of <Q>devout and honor|able women,</Q> the &s;acred &s;criptures re|cord "not a few." Some of the mo&s;t affecting &s;cenes, the mo&s;t intere&s;ting tran&s;|actions, and the mo&s;t touching conver&s;|ations which are recorded of the Saviour of the world, pa&s;&s;ed with women. <HI>They</HI> are the fir&s;t remarked as having <Q>mini&s;|tered to him of their &s;ub&s;tance.</Q> <HI>Theirs</HI> was the prai&s;e of not abandoning their de&s;pi&s;ed Redeemer when he was led to execution, and under all the hopele&s;s cir|cum&s;tances of his ignominious death; <HI>they</HI> appear to have been the <HI>la&s;t</HI> attend|ing at his tomb, and the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> on the morning when he aro&s;e from it. <HI>Theirs</HI> was the privilege of receiving the earlie&s;t con&s;olations from their ri&s;en Lord; <HI>theirs</HI> was the honour of being fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ion|ed

<P>THE &s;exes will naturally de&s;ire to appear to each other, &s;uch as each believes the other will be&s;t like; their conver&s;ation will act reciprocally; and each &s;ex will appear more or le&s;s rational as they per|ceive it will more or le&s;s recommend them to the other. It is therefore to be regret|ted, that many men, even of di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;en&s;e and learning, are too apt to con&s;ider the &s;ociety of ladies, rather as a &s;cene in which to re&s;t their under&s;tandings, than to exerci&s;e them; and ladies, in return, are too much addicted to make their court by lending them&s;elves to this &s;pirit of trifling;
<PB N="43" REF="50">they often avoid to make u&s;e of what abili|ties they have; and affect to talk below their natural and acquired powers of mind; con&s;idering it as a tacit and welcome flat|tery to the under&s;tanding of men, to re|nounce the exerci&s;e of their own.</P>
<P>But &s;ince their ta&s;te and principles thus mutually operate; men, by keeping up conver&s;ation to its proper &s;tandard, would not only call into exerci&s;e the powers of mind which women actually po&s;&s;e&s;s; but would even awaken energies which they do not know they po&s;&s;e&s;s; and men of &s;en&s;e would find their account in doing this, for their own talents would be more highly rated by companions who were better able to appreciate them. And, on the other hand, if young women found it did not often recommend them in the eyes of tho&s;e whom they wi&s;h to plea&s;e, to be frivolous and &s;uperficial, they would become more &s;edulous in correcting their own habits; and, whenever fa&s;hionable women indicate a reli&s;h for in&s;tructive conver&s;ation,
<PB N="44" REF="51">men will not be apt to hazard what is vain or unprofitable; much le&s;s will they ever pre&s;ume to bring forward what is loo&s;e or corrupt, where &s;ome &s;ignal has not been previou&s;ly given, that it will be acceptable, or at lea&s;t that it will be par|doned.</P>
<P>Ladies commonly bring into company minds already too much relaxed by petty pur&s;uits, rather than over&s;trained by too inten&s;e application; the littlene&s;s of the employments in which they are u&s;ually engaged, does not &s;o &s;train their minds or exhau&s;t their &s;pirits as to make them &s;tand in need of that relaxation from company which &s;evere application or overwhelming bu&s;ine&s;s makes requi&s;ite for &s;tudious or public men. The due con&s;ideration of this circum&s;tance might &s;erve to bring the &s;exes more nearly on a level in &s;ociety; and each might meet the other half way; for that degree of lively and ea&s;y conver&s;ation which is a nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;hment to the learned and the bu&s;y, would not decrea&s;e
<PB N="45" REF="52">in plea&s;antne&s;s by being made of &s;o rational a ca&s;t as would yet &s;omewhat rai&s;e the minds of women, who commonly &s;eek &s;o|ciety as a &s;cene of plea&s;ure, not as a refuge from overwhelming thought or labour.</P>
<P>It is a di&s;advantage even to tho&s;e women who keep the be&s;t company, that it is un|happily almo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed into a &s;y&s;tem, by the other &s;ex, to po&s;tpone every thing like in&s;tructive di&s;cour&s;e till the ladies are with|drawn; their retreat &s;erving as a kind of &s;ignal for the exerci&s;e of intellect. And in the few ca&s;es in which it happens that any important di&s;cu&s;&s;ion takes place in their pre&s;ence, they are for the mo&s;t part con|&s;idered as having little intere&s;t in &s;erious &s;ubjects. Strong truths, whenever &s;uch happen to be addre&s;&s;ed to them, are either diluted with flattery, or kept back in part, or &s;oftened to their ta&s;te; or if the ladies expre&s;s a wi&s;h for information on any point, they are put off with a compliment, in&s;tead of a rea&s;on; and are con&s;idered

Let us not, however, be mi&s;under&s;tood; it is not meant to pre&s;cribe that they &s;hould affect to talk on lofty &s;ubjects, &s;o much as to &s;ugge&s;t that they &s;hould bring good &s;en&s;e, &s;implicity, and preci&s;ion into tho&s;e com|mon &s;ubjects, of which, after all, both the bu&s;ine&s;s and the conver&s;ation of mankind is in a great mea&s;ure made up.</P>
<P>It is too well known how much the dread of imputed pedantry keeps off any thing that verges towards <HI>learned,</HI> and the terror of imputed enthu&s;ia&s;m, &s;taves off any thing that approaches to <HI>&s;erious</HI> con|ver&s;ation, &s;o that the two topics which peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;h us, as rational and immortal beings, are by general con&s;ent in a good degree bani&s;hed from the &s;ociety of rational and immortal creatures.

<P>As in the momentous times in which we live, it is next to impo&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s an evening in company, but the talk will &s;o inevitably revert to politics, that, without any premeditated de&s;ign, every one pre&s;ent &s;hall infallibly get to know to which &s;ide the other inclines; why, in the far higher concern of eternal things, &s;hould we &s;o carefully &s;hun every offered opportunity of bearing even a ca&s;ual te&s;timony to the part we e&s;pou&s;e in religion? Why, while we make it a &s;ort of point of con&s;cience to leave no doubt on the mind of a &s;tranger, whether we adopt the party of Pitt or Fox, &s;hall we chu&s;e to leave it very problematical whether we belong to God or Baal? Why, in religion, as well as in politics, &s;hould we not act like people who, having their all at &s;take, cannot forbear now and then
<PB N="50" REF="57">adverting for a moment to the object of their grand concern, and dropping, at lea&s;t, an incidental intimation of the &s;ide to which they belong?</P>
<P>Even the news of the day, in &s;uch an eventful period as the pre&s;ent, may lend frequent occa&s;ions to a woman of prin|ciple, to declare, without parade, her faith in a moral Governor of the world; her tru&s;t in a particular Providence; her belief in the Divine Omnipotence; her confi|dence in the power of God, in educing good from evil, in his employing wicked nations, not as favourites but in&s;truments; her per&s;ua&s;ion that pre&s;ent &s;ucce&s;s is no proof of the divine favour; in &s;hort, &s;ome intimation that &s;he is not a&s;hamed to de|clare that her mind is under the influence of Chri&s;tian faith and principle. A general concurrence in exhibiting this &s;pirit of decided faith and holy tru&s;t, would incon|ceivably di&s;courage that pert infidelity which is ever on the watch to produce it&s;elf; and, as we have already ob&s;erved, if
<PB N="51" REF="58">women, who derive authority from their rank or talents, did but reflect how their &s;entiments are repeated and their authority quoted, they would be &s;o on their guard, that general &s;ociety might become a &s;cene of general improvement, and the young, who are looking for models on which to fa&s;hion them&s;elves, would be a&s;hamed of exhibiting any thing like levity or &s;ceptici&s;m.</P>
<P>Let it be under&s;tood, that it is not meant to intimate that &s;erious &s;ubjects &s;hould make up the bulk of conver&s;ation; this, as it is impo&s;&s;ible, would al&s;o often be improper. It is not intended to &s;ugge&s;t that they &s;hould be &s;tudiou&s;ly introduced, or affectedly prolonged; but only that they &s;hould not be &s;y&s;tematically &s;hunned, nor the brand of fanatici&s;m be fixed on the per&s;on who, with whatever propriety, hazards the intro|duction of them. It is evident, however, that this general dread of &s;erious topics ari&s;es a good deal from an ignorance of the true nature of religion; people avoid
<PB N="52" REF="59">it on the principle expre&s;&s;ed by the vulgar phra&s;e of the danger of playing with edge tools. They conceive of it as &s;omething which involves controver&s;y, and di&s;pute, and mi&s;chief; &s;omething of an inflammatory nature, which is to &s;tir up ill humours; as of a &s;ort of party bu&s;ine&s;s which &s;ets friends at variance. So much is this notion adopted, that I have &s;een two works announced of con&s;iderable merit, in which it was &s;tipulated as an attraction, that religion, as being likely to excite anger and party di&s;tinctions, &s;hould be excluded. Such is the worldly idea of the &s;pirit of that religion, who&s;e preci&s;e object it was to bring <Q>peace and good will to men!</Q></P>
<P>Women too little live or conver&s;e up to their under&s;tandings; and however we have deprecated affectation or pedantry, let it be remembered, that both in reading and conver&s;ing the under&s;tanding gains more by &s;tretching, than &s;tooping. If by ex|erting it&s;elf it may not attain to all it de|&s;ires,
<PB N="53" REF="60">yet it will be &s;ure to gain &s;omething. The mind, by always applying it&s;elf to ob|jects below its level, contracts and &s;hrinks it&s;elf to the &s;ize, and lowers it&s;elf to the level, of the object about which it is con|ver&s;ant: while the mind which is active expands and rai&s;es it&s;elf, grows larger by exerci&s;e, abler by diffu&s;ion, and richer by communication.</P>
<P>But the ta&s;te of general &s;ociety is not favourable to improvement. The &s;eriou&s;|ne&s;s with which the mo&s;t frivolous &s;ubjects are agitated, and the levity with which the mo&s;t &s;erious are di&s;patched, bear a pretty exact proportion to each other. Society too is a &s;ort of magic lanthorn; the &s;cene is perpetually &s;hifting. In this in|ce&s;&s;ant change, the evane&s;cent fa&s;hion of the exi&s;ting minute, which, while in many it leads to the cultivation of real know|ledge, has al&s;o &s;ometimes led even the gay and idle to the affectation of mixing a &s;prinkling of &s;cience with the ma&s;s of di&s;&s;i|pation. The ambition of appearing to be
<PB N="54" REF="61">well informed breaks out even in tho&s;e triflers who will not &s;pare time from their plea&s;urable pur&s;uits &s;ufficient for acquiring that knowledge, of which, however, the re|ception is &s;o de&s;irable. A little &s;mattering of philo&s;ophy often dignifies the pur&s;uits of their day, without re&s;cuing them from the vanities of the night. A cour&s;e of lectures (that admirable a&s;&s;i&s;tant for en|lightening the under&s;tanding) is not &s;eldom re&s;orted to as a means to &s;ub&s;titute the appearance of knowledge for the fatigue of application; but where this valuable help is attended merely like any other public exhibition, and is not furthered by corre&s;pondent reading at home, it often &s;erves to &s;et off the reality of ignorance with the affectation of &s;kill. But in&s;tead of producing in conver&s;ation a few reigning &s;cientific terms, with a familiarity and readine&s;s, which Amaze the unlearn'd, and make the learned &s;mile, would it not be more mode&s;t even for tho&s;e who are better informed, to avoid
<PB N="55" REF="62">the common u&s;e of technical terms when|ever the idea can be conveyed without them? For it argues no real ability to know the <HI>names</HI> of tools; the ability lies in knowing their <HI>u&s;e:</HI> and while it is in the thing, and not in the term, that real know|ledge con&s;i&s;ts, the charge of pedantry is attached to the u&s;e of the term, which would not attach to the knowledge of the &s;cience.</P>
<P>In the faculty of &s;peaking well, ladies have &s;uch a happy promptitude of turning their &s;lender advantages to account, that there are many who, though they have never been taught a rule of &s;yntax, yet, by a quick facility in profiting from the be&s;t books and the be&s;t company, hardly ever violate one; and who often po&s;&s;e&s;s an elegant and per&s;picuous arrangement of &s;tyle, without having &s;tudied any of the laws of compo&s;ition. Every kind of knowledge which appears to be the re&s;ult of ob&s;ervation, reflection, and natural ta&s;te &s;its gracefully on women. Yet on the
<PB N="56" REF="63">other hand it &s;ometimes happens, that ladies of no contemptible natural parts are too ready to produce, not only pedan|tic expre&s;&s;ions, but crude notions; and &s;till oftner to bring forward obvious and hackneyed remarks, which float on the very &s;urface of a &s;ubject, with the impo&s;ing air of recent invention, and all the vanity of con&s;cious di&s;covery. This is becau&s;e their acquirements have not been woven into their minds by early in&s;truction; what knowledge they have gotten &s;tands out as it were above the very &s;urface of their minds, like the <HI>appliqu&eacute;e</HI> of the embroiderer, in&s;tead of having been interwoven with the growth of the piece, &s;o as to have be|come a part of the &s;tuff. They did not, like men, acquire what they know while the texture was forming. Perhaps no better preventive could be devi&s;ed for this literary vanity, than early in&s;truct|ion: that woman would be le&s;s likely to be vain of her knowledge who did not remember the time when &s;he was ignorant.
<PB N="57" REF="64">Knowledge that is <HI>burnt in,</HI> if I may &s;o &s;peak, is &s;eldom obtru&s;ive.</P>
<P>Their reading al&s;o has probably con&s;i&s;ted much in abridgments from larger works, as was ob&s;erved in a former chapter; this makes a readier talker, but a &s;hallower thinker, than books of more bulk. By the&s;e &s;canty &s;ketches their critical &s;pirit has been excited, while their critical pow|ers have not been formed. For in tho&s;e crippled mutilations they have &s;een no|thing of that ju&s;t proportion of parts, that &s;kilful arrangement of the plan, and that artful di&s;tribution of the &s;ubject, which, while they prove the ma&s;ter hand of the writer, &s;erve al&s;o to form the ta&s;te of the reader, far more than a di&s;-jointed &s;keleton, or a beautiful feature or two can do. The in&s;truction of women is al&s;o too much drawn from the &s;canty and penurious &s;ources of &s;hort writings of the e&s;&s;ay kind: this, when it compri&s;es the be&s;t part of a per&s;on's reading, makes &s;matterers and &s;poils &s;cholars; for though it &s;upplies
<PB N="58" REF="65">ready talk, yet it does not make a full mind; it does not furni&s;h a &s;tore hou&s;e of materials to &s;tock the under&s;tand|ing, neither does it accu&s;tom the mind to any trains of reflection: for the &s;ubjects, be&s;ides being each &s;uccinctly, and, on ac|count of this brevity, &s;uperficially treated, are di&s;tinct and di&s;connected; they form no concatenation of ideas, nor any depend|ent &s;eries of deduction. Yet on this plea|&s;ant but de&s;ultory reading, the mind which has not been trained to &s;everer ex|erci&s;e, loves to repo&s;e it&s;elf in a &s;ort of creditable indolence, in&s;tead of &s;tretching its powers in the whole&s;ome labour of con|fecutive inve&s;tigation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The writer cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed de&s;irous of depre|ciating the value of tho&s;e many beautiful periodical effays which adorn our language. But, perhaps, it might be better to regale the mind with them &s;ingly, at different times, than to read at the &s;ame &s;itting, a multitude of &s;hort pieces on di&s;&s;imilar and contradict|ory topics, <HI>by way of getting through the book.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>I am not di&s;couraging &s;tudy at a late period of life, or even &s;lender knowledge;
<PB N="59" REF="66">information is good at whatever period and in whatever degree it be acquired. But in &s;uch ca&s;es it &s;hould be at|tended with peculiar humility; and the new po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or &s;hould bear in mind, that what is fre&s;h to her has been long known to others; and &s;he &s;hould be aware of ad|vancing as novel that which is common, and obtruding as rare that which every body po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. Some ladies are eager to exhibit proofs of their reading, though at the expence of their judgment, and will in|troduce in conver&s;ation quotations quite irrelevant to the matter in hand, becau&s;e they happen to recur to their recollection, or were, perhaps, found in the book they have ju&s;t been reading. Inappropriate quotations or &s;trained analogy may &s;hew reading, but they do not &s;hew ta&s;te. That ju&s;t and happy allu&s;ion which knows by a word how to awaken a corre&s;ponding image, or to excite in the mind of the hearer the idea which fills the mind of the &s;peaker, &s;hews le&s;s pedantry and more
<PB N="60" REF="67">ta&s;te than bare citations; and a mind imbued with elegant knowledge will in|evitably betray the opulence of its re|&s;ources, even on topics which do not relate to &s;cience or literature. Well informed per&s;ons will ea&s;ily be di&s;covered to have read the be&s;t books, though they are not always detailing catalogues of authors. True ta&s;te will detect the infu&s;ion which true mode&s;ty will not di&s;play; and even common &s;ubjects pa&s;&s;ing through a cultivated under&s;tanding, borrow a flavour of its richne&s;s. A power of apt &s;election is more valuable than any power of general retention; and an appo|&s;ite remark, which &s;hoots &s;trait to the point, demands higher powers of mind than an hundred &s;imple acts of mere memory: for the bu&s;ine&s;s of the memory is only to &s;tore up materials which the under&s;tanding is to mix and work up with its native faculties, and which the judgment is to bring out and apply. But young women, who have more vivacity than &s;en&s;e, and more vanity than vivacity, often ri&s;k the charge of ab|&s;urdity
<PB N="61" REF="68">to e&s;cape that of ignorance, and will even compare two authors who are totally unlike rather than mi&s;s the occa&s;ion to &s;hew that they have read both.</P>
<P>Among the arts to &s;poil conver&s;ation, &s;ome ladies po&s;&s;e&s;s that of &s;uddenly divert|ing it from the channel in which it was beneficially flowing, becau&s;e &s;ome <HI>word</HI> u&s;ed by the per&s;on who was &s;peaking has accidentally &s;truck out a new train of thinking in their own minds, and not be|cau&s;e the <HI>idea</HI> expre&s;&s;ed has &s;truck out a fre&s;h idea, which &s;ort of colli&s;ion is in|deed the way of eliciting the true fire. Young ladies, who&s;e &s;prightline&s;s has not been di&s;ciplined by a correct education, are &s;ometimes willing to purcha&s;e the prai&s;e of being lively at the ri&s;k of being thought ra&s;h or vain. They now and then con&s;ider how things may be prettily &s;aid, rather than how they may be prudently or &s;ea&s;onably &s;poken; and hazard being thought wrong for the chance of being reckoned plea&s;ant.
<PB N="62" REF="69">The flowers of rhetoric captivate them more than the ju&s;te&s;t deductions of rea&s;on; and to repel an argument they arm them&s;elves with a metaphor. Tho&s;e al&s;o who do not aim &s;o high as eloquence, are often &s;urpri&s;ed that you refu&s;e to accept of a pre|judice in&s;tead of a rea&s;on; they are apt to take up with a probability in place of a demon&s;tration, and cheaply put you off with an a&s;&s;ertion when you are requiring a proof. The &s;ame mode of education ren|ders them al&s;o impatient of oppo&s;ition; and if they happen to po&s;&s;e&s;s beauty, and to be vain of it, they may be tempted to con|&s;ider that as an additional proof of their being in the right. In this ca&s;e, they will not a&s;k the conviction of your judgment to the force of their argument, &s;o much as to the authority of their charms; for they prefer a &s;acrifice to a convert, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their will flatters them more than pro&s;elyti&s;m to their <Q>pleaded rea&s;on.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="70">The &s;ame turn of mind, &s;trengthened by the &s;ame cau&s;e, (a neglected educa|tion,) leads lively women often to pro|nounce on a que&s;tion without examining it: on any given point they &s;eldomet <HI>doubt</HI> than men; not becau&s;e they are more clear-&s;ighted, but becau&s;e they have not been accu&s;tomed to look into a &s;ub|ject long enough to di&s;cover its depths and its intricacies; and, not di&s;cerning its difficulties, they conclude that it has none.

<P>For if the great Roman Orator could ob&s;erve, that &s;ilence was &s;o important a part of conver&s;ation, that <Q>there was not only an art but an eloquence in it,</Q> how peculiarly does the remark apply to the mode&s;ty of youthful females!

<P>Yet do we not &s;ometimes &s;ee an impa|tience to be heard (nor is it a <HI>feminine</HI> failing only) which good breeding can &s;carcely &s;ubdue?

<P>But conver&s;ation mu&s;t not be con|&s;idered as a &s;tage for the di&s;play of our talents, &s;o much as a field for the exerci&s;e and improvement of our virtues; as a means for promoting the glory of our Creator and the good and happine&s;s of our fellow creatures.

Vanity, jealou&s;y, envy, mi&s;repre&s;entation, re&s;entment, di&s;dain, le|vity, impatience, in&s;incerity, will in turn &s;olicit to be gratified. Con&s;tantly to &s;trug|gle again&s;t the de&s;ire of being thought more wi&s;e, more witty, and more knowing, than tho&s;e with whom we a&s;&s;ociate, demands the ince&s;&s;ant exertion of that Chri&s;tian vigilance which the generality are &s;o far from &s;u&s;pecting, ought to be brought into exerci&s;e in the intercour&s;e of common &s;ociety; that cheerful conver&s;a|tion is rather con&s;idered as an exemption and relea&s;e from watchfulne&s;s, than as an additional obligation to it.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="75">But &s;ociety, as was ob&s;erved before, is not a &s;tage on which to throw down our gauntlet, and prove our own prowe&s;s by the number of falls we give to our adver|&s;ary; &s;o far from it, that good breeding as well as Chri&s;tianity, con&s;iders as an indi&s;pen&s;able requi&s;ite for conver&s;ation, the di&s;po&s;ition to bring forward to notice any talent in others, which their own mode&s;ty, or con&s;cious inferiority, would lead them to keep back. To do this with effect requires a penetration exer|ci&s;ed to di&s;cern merit, and a generous candour which delights in drawing it out. There are few who cannot conver&s;e tole|rably on &s;ome one topic; what that is, we &s;hould try to find out, and introduce that topic, though to the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of any one on which we our&s;elves are &s;uppo&s;ed to excel: and however &s;uperior we may be in other re&s;pects to the per&s;ons in que&s;tion, we may, perhaps, in that parti|cular point, improve by them; and if we do not gain information, we &s;hall at lea&s;t
<PB N="69" REF="76">gain a whole&s;ome exerci&s;e to our humility and &s;elf-denial; we &s;hall be re&s;training our own impetuou&s;ity; we &s;hall be giving confidence to a doubting, or cheerfulne&s;s to a depre&s;&s;ed &s;pirit. And to place a ju&s;t remark, hazarded by the diffident in the mo&s;t advantageous point of view; to call the attention of the inattentive to the ob|&s;ervation of one, who, though of much worth, is perhaps of little note; the&s;e are requi&s;ites for conver&s;ation, le&s;s brilliant, but far more valuable, than the power of exciting bur&s;ts of laughter by the brighte&s;t wit, or of extorting admiration by the mo&s;t poignant &s;allies.</P>
<P>For wit is of all the qualities of the female mind that which requires the &s;evere&s;t ca&s;tigation; yet the temperate ex|erci&s;e of this fa&s;cinating quality throws an additional lu&s;tre round the character of an amiable woman; for to manage with di&s;creet mode&s;ty a dangerous talent, con|fers a higher prai&s;e than can be claimed by tho&s;e in whom the ab&s;ence of the talent
<PB N="70" REF="77">takes away the temptation to mi&s;employ it. But to women, wit is a peculiarly perilous po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which nothing &s;hort of the &s;obermindedne&s;s of Chri&s;tianity can keep in order. Intemperate wit craves admiration as its natural aliment; it lives on flattery as its daily bread. The pro|fe&s;&s;ed wit is a hungry beggar that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts on the extorted alms of perpetual panegy|ric; and, like the vulture in the Grecian fable, its appetite increa&s;es by indulgence. Simple truth and &s;ober approbation be|come ta&s;tele&s;s and in&s;ipid to the palate, daily vitiated by the delicious poignancies of exaggerated commendation.</P>
<P>But if it be true that &s;ome women are too apt to affect brilliancy and di&s;play in their own di&s;cour&s;e, and to undervalue the more humble preten&s;ions of le&s;s &s;howy characters; it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed al&s;o, that &s;ome of more ordinary abilities are now and then guilty of the oppo&s;ite error, and fooli&s;hly affect to value them&s;elves on not making u&s;e of the under&s;tanding they
<PB N="71" REF="78">really po&s;&s;e&s;s. They exhibit no &s;mall &s;atisfac|tion in ridiculing women of high intellectual endowments, while they exclaim with much affected humility, and much real envy, that <Q>they are thankful <HI>they</HI> are not geniu&s;es.</Q> Now, though one is glad to hear gratitude expre&s;&s;ed on any occa&s;ion, yet the want of &s;en&s;e is really no &s;uch great mercy to be thankful for; and it would indicate a better &s;pirit, were they to pray to be enabled to make a right u&s;e of the moderate under&s;tanding they po&s;&s;e&s;s, than to expo&s;e with a too vi&s;ible plea&s;ure the imaginary or real defects of their more &s;hining acquaintance. Women of the brighte&s;t faculties &s;hould not only "bear tho&s;e faculties meekly," but con&s;ider it as no derogation, cheerfully to fulfil tho&s;e humbler duties which make up the bu&s;ine&s;s of common life, always taking into the account the higher re&s;pon|&s;ibility attached to higher gifts. While women of lower attainments &s;hould exert to the utmo&s;t &s;uch abilities as Providence
<PB N="72" REF="79">has a&s;&s;igned them; and while they &s;hould not deride excellencies which are above their reach, they &s;hould not de&s;pond at an inferiority which did not depend on them&s;elves; nor, becau&s;e God has denied them ten talents, &s;hould they forget that they are equally re&s;pon&s;ible for the one he <HI>has</HI> allotted them, but &s;et about devoting that one with humble diligence to the glory of the Giver.</P>
<P>Vanity, however, is not the monopoly of talents; let not a young lady, there|fore, fancy that &s;he is humble, merely becau&s;e &s;he is not ingenious. Humility is not the exclu&s;ive privilege of dulne&s;s. Folly is as conceited as wit, and ignorance many a time out&s;trips knowledge in the race of vanity. Equally earne&s;t competi|tions in conver&s;ation &s;pring from cau&s;es le&s;s worthy to excite them than wit and genius. Vanity in&s;inuates it&s;elf into the female heart under a variety of un&s;u&s;pect|ed forms, and &s;eizes on many a little pa&s;s which was not thought worth guarding.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="80">Who has not &s;een a re&s;tle&s;s emotion agitate the features of an anxious matron, while peace and fame hung trembling in doubtful &s;u&s;pence on the &s;ucce&s;s of a &s;oup or a &s;auce, on which &s;entence was about to be pronounced by &s;ome con&s;ummate critic, as could have been excited by any competition for literary renown, or any &s;truggle for conte&s;ted wit?</P>
<P>There is another &s;pecies of vanity in &s;ome women which di&s;gui&s;es it&s;elf under the thin veil of an affected humility; they will accu&s;e them&s;elves of &s;ome fault from which they are remarkably exempt, and lament the want of &s;ome talent which they are rather notorious for po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing. This is not only a clum&s;y trap for prai&s;e, but there is a di&s;ingenuous intention, by renouncing a quality they eminently po&s;|&s;e&s;s, to gain credit for others in which they are really deficient. All affectation involves a &s;pecies of deceit. The Apo&s;tle when he enjoins, <Q>not to think of our|&s;elves more highly than we ought,</Q>
<PB N="74" REF="81">does not exhort us to think <HI>fal&s;ely</HI> of our|&s;elves, but to think "&s;oberly;" and it is worth ob&s;erving that in this injunction he does not u&s;e the word <HI>&s;peak,</HI> but <HI>think,</HI> inferring po&s;&s;ibly, that it would be &s;afer not to <HI>&s;peak</HI> of our&s;elves at all; for it is &s;o far from being an unequivocal proof of our humility to talk even of our defects, that while we make <HI>&s;elf</HI> the &s;ubject, in whatever way, &s;elf-love contrives to be gratified, and will even be content that our faults &s;hould be talked of, rather than that we &s;hould not be talked of at all. Some are al&s;o attacked with &s;uch proud fits of humility, that while they are ready to accu&s;e them&s;elves of almo&s;t every &s;in in the lump, they yet take fire at the imputation of the &s;lighte&s;t <HI>individual</HI> fault; and in&s;tantly enter upon their own vindication as warmly as if you, and not them&s;elves, had brought forward the charge. The truth is, they ventured to condemn them&s;elves, in the full confidence that you would contradict them; the la&s;t
<PB N="75" REF="82">thing they intended was that you &s;hould believe them, and they are never &s;o much piqued, and di&s;appointed as when they are taken at their word.</P>
<P>Of the various &s;hapes and undefined forms into which vanity branches out in conver&s;ation there is no end. Out of a re&s;tle&s;s de&s;ire to plea&s;e, grows the &s;purious de&s;ire to a&s;toni&s;h: from vanity as much as from credulity, ari&s;es that &s;trong love of the marvellous, with which the conver|&s;ation of the ill-educated abounds. Hence that fondne&s;s for dealing in narratives hardly within the compa&s;s of po&s;&s;ibility. Here vanity has many &s;hades of gratifica|tion; tho&s;e &s;hades will be &s;tronger or weaker, whether the relater have been an eye witne&s;s of the wonder &s;he recounts; or whether &s;he claim only the &s;econd hand renown of its having happened to her friend, or the &s;till remoter celebrity of its having been witne&s;&s;ed only by her friend's friend: but even though that friend only knew the man, who remembered the
<PB N="76" REF="83">woman, who actually beheld the thing which is now cau&s;ing admiration in the company, &s;till <HI>&s;elf,</HI> though in a fainter degree, is brought into notice, and the relater contrives in &s;ome circuitous way to be connected with the wonder.</P>
<P>To correct this propen&s;ity <Q>to elevate and &s;urpri&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Rehear&s;al.</NOTE></Q> it would be well in mixed &s;ociety to ab&s;tain altogether from hazard|ing &s;tories, which though they may not be ab&s;olutely fal&s;e, yet lying without the verge of probability, are apt to impeach the credit of the narrator; in whom the very con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that &s;he is not believed, excites an increa&s;ed eagerne&s;s to depart &s;till farther from the &s;oberne&s;s of truth, and induces a habit of vehement a&s;&s;evera|tion, which is too often called in to help out a que&s;tionable point <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This is al&s;o a good rule in compo&s;ition.

<P><PB N="77" REF="84">There is another &s;hape, and a very de|formed &s;hape it is, in which loquacious vanity &s;hews it&s;elf; I mean, the betraying of confi|dence.

It does not &s;o often &s;pring from the mi&s;chievous de&s;ire of divulging a &s;ecret, as from the pride of having been tru&s;ted with it.

<P>There is one offence committed in con|ver&s;ation of much too &s;erious a nature to be overlooked, or to be animadverted on without &s;orrow and indignation: I mean, the habitual and thoughtle&s;s prophanene&s;s of tho&s;e who are repeatedly invoking their Maker's name on occa&s;ions the mo&s;t trivial. It is offen&s;ive in all its variety of a&s;pects;&mdash;it is very pernicious in its effects; &mdash;it is a <HI>growing</HI> evil;&mdash;tho&s;e who are mo&s;t guilty of it, are from habit hardly con&s;cious when they do it; are not aware of the &s;in; and for both the&s;e rea&s;ons, without the admonitions of faith|ful friend&s;hip, little likely to di&s;continue it; &mdash;it it utterly INEXCUSABLE;&mdash;it has none of the palliatives of <HI>temptation</HI> which other vices plead, and in that re&s;pect &s;tands di&s;tingui&s;hed from all others both in its nature and degree of guilt.&mdash;Like many other &s;ins, however, it is at once cau&s;e and effect; it <HI>proceeds</HI> from want of
<PB N="79" REF="86">love and reverence to the be&s;t of Beings, and <HI>cau&s;es</HI> that want both in them&s;elves and others. Yet with all tho&s;e aggrava|tions, there is, perhaps, hardly any &s;in &s;o frequently committed, &s;o &s;eldom repented of, and &s;o little guarded again&s;t. On the &s;core of <HI>impropriety</HI> too, it is additionally offen&s;ive, as being utterly repugnant to female delicacy, which often affects to be &s;hocked at &s;wearing in a man. Now this &s;pecies of profanene&s;s is not only &s;wearing, but, perhaps, &s;wearing of the wor&s;t &s;ort; as it is a <HI>direct</HI> breach of an expre&s;s com|mand, and offends again&s;t the <HI>very letter</HI> of that law which &s;ays in &s;o many words, THOU SHALT NOT TAKE THE NAME OF THE LORD THY GOD IN VAIN.

<P><PB N="80" REF="87">I would endeavour to give &s;ome faint idea of the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of this offence, by an analogy (Oh! how inadequate!) with which the feeling heart, even though not &s;ea&s;oned with religion, may be touched.

<P>Among the deep, but le&s;s obvious mi&s;chiefs of conver&s;ation, <HI>mi&s;repre&s;entation</HI> mu&s;t not be overlooked.

<P>Yet, how often in &s;ociety, otherwi&s;e re&s;pectable, are we pained with narrations in which prejudice warps, and &s;elf-love blinds!

<P>The grievous fault of gro&s;s and obvious detraction which infects conver&s;ation, has been &s;o heavily and &s;o ju&s;tly condemned by divines and morali&s;ts, that the &s;ubject is exhau&s;ted. But there is an error of an oppo&s;ite complexion, which we have be|fore noticed, and again&s;t which the pecu|liar temper of the times requires, that young ladies of a better ca&s;t &s;hould be guarded. From the narrowne&s;s of their own &s;phere of ob&s;ervation, they are &s;ome|times addicted to accu&s;e of uncharitable|ne&s;s, that di&s;tingui&s;hing judgment which, re&s;ulting from a &s;ound penetration and a zeal for truth, forbids per&s;ons of a very
<PB N="86" REF="93">correct principle to be indi&s;criminately prodigal of commendation without in|quiry, and of prai&s;e without di&s;tinction. There is an affectation of candour, which is almo&s;t as mi&s;chievous as calumny it&s;elf; nay, if it be le&s;s injurious in its individual application, it is, perhaps, more alarming in its general principle, as it lays wa&s;te the &s;trong fences which &s;eparate good from evil. They know (though they &s;ometimes calumniate) that calumny is wrong but they have not been told that flattery is wrong al&s;o; and youth being apt to fancy that the direct contrary to wrong mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be right, are apt to be driven into extremes. The dread of being only &s;u&s;pected of one fault makes them actually guilty of the other; and to avoid the charge of envy they plunge into in&s;incerity. In this they are actuated by an un&s;ound judgment or an unfound principle. But the &s;tandard of truth and of ju&s;tice mu&s;t neither be elevated nor depre&s;&s;ed, in order to accom|modate
<PB N="87" REF="94">it to exi&s;ting circum&s;tances. Good natured young people often &s;peak favour|ably of unworthy, or extravagantly of com|mon characters, from one of the&s;e motives; either their own views of excellence are low, or they &s;peak re&s;pectully of the un|de&s;erving, to purcha&s;e for them&s;elves the reputation of tenderne&s;s and genero&s;ity; or they lavi&s;h un&s;paring prai&s;e on almo&s;t all alike, in the u&s;urious hope of buying back univer&s;al commendation in return; or in the&s;e captivating characters in which the &s;imple and ma&s;culine language of truth is &s;acrificed to the jargon of affect|ed &s;oftne&s;s; and in which &s;mooth and pliant manners are &s;ub&s;tituted for intrin&s;ic worth, the inexperienced are too apt to <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> virtues, and to <HI>forgive</HI> vices. But they &s;hould carefully guard again&s;t the error of making <HI>manner</HI> the criterion of merit, and of giving unlimited credit to &s;trangers for po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing every perfection, only becau&s;e they bring into company the engaging exterior of alluring gentlene&s;s.
<PB N="88" REF="95">They &s;hould al&s;o remember that it is an ea&s;y, but not an hone&s;t way of obtaining the prai&s;e of candour to get into the &s;oft and popular habit of &s;aying of all their acquaintance, when &s;peaking of them, that <HI>they are &s;o good!</HI> True Chri&s;tian candour conceals faults, but it does not invent virtues. It tenderly forbears to expo&s;e the evil which may belong to a character, but it dares not a&s;cribe to it the good which does not exi&s;t. To correct this propen&s;ity to in&s;incerity, it would be well to bear in mind, that while every good action, come from what &s;ource it may, and every good quality, be it found in whom&s;oever it will, de&s;erves its fair proportion of di&s;tinct and willing com|mendation; yet no character is GOOD in the true &s;en&s;e of the word which is not RELIGIOUS.</P>

<P>Remember al&s;o, that true good nature is the &s;oul, of which politene&s;s is only the garb. It is not that artifical quality which is taken up by many when they go into &s;ociety, in order to charm tho&s;e whom it is not their particular bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="91" REF="98">to plea&s;e; and is laid down when they return home to tho&s;e to whom to appear amiable is a real duty. It is not that fa&s;cinating but deceitful &s;oftne&s;s, which, after having acted over a hundred &s;cenes of the mo&s;t lively &s;ympathy and tender intere&s;t with every &s;light acquaintance; after having exhau&s;ted every phra&s;e of feeling, for the trivial &s;ickne&s;&s;es or petty &s;orrows of multitudes who are &s;carcely known, leaves it doubtful whether a grain of real feeling or genuine &s;ympathy be re&s;erved for the deare&s;t connexions; and which di&s;mi&s;&s;es a woman to her immediate friends with little affection, and to her own family with little attachment.</P>
<P>True good nature, that which alone de&s;erves the name, is not a holiday orna|ment, but an every-day habit. It does not con&s;i&s;t in &s;ervile complai&s;ance, or di&s;hone&s;t flattery, or affected &s;ympathy, or unqualified a&s;&s;ent, or unwarrantable compliance, or eternal &s;miles. Before it can be allowed to rank with the virtues,
<PB N="92" REF="99">it mu&s;t be wrought up from a di&s;po&s;ition into a principle, from a humour into a habit. It mu&s;t be the re&s;ult of an equal and well-governed mind, not the &s;tart of ca&s;ual gaiety, the trick of de&s;igning vanity, or the whim of capricious fondne&s;s. It is compounded of kindne&s;s, forbearance, for|givene&s;s, and &s;elf-denial; <Q>it &s;eeketh not its own,</Q> but mu&s;t be capable of making continual &s;acrifices of its own ta&s;tes, hu|mours, and &s;elf-love; but among the &s;acri&s;ices it makes, it mu&s;t never include its integrity. Politene&s;s on the one hand, and in&s;en&s;ibility on the other, a&s;&s;ume its name and wear its honours; but they a&s;&s;ume the honours of a triumph, without the merit of a victory; for politene&s;s &s;ub|dues nothing, and in&s;en&s;ibility has nothing to &s;ubdue. Good nature of the true ca&s;t, and under the foregoing regulations, is above all price in the common intercour&s;e of dome&s;tic &s;ociety; for an ordinary quality which is con&s;tantly brought into action, by the perpetually recurring
<PB N="93" REF="100">though minute events of daily life, is of higher value than more brilliant qualities which are more &s;eldom called into u&s;e. And indeed, Chri&s;tianity has given that new turn to the character of all the virtues, that perhaps it is the be&s;t te&s;t of the excellence of many that they have little brilliancy in them. The Chri&s;tian Religion has degraded &s;ome &s;plendid qua|lities from the rank they held, and elevated tho&s;e which were ob&s;cure into di&s;tinction.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XV.</HI> On the danger of an ill-directed Sen&s;ibility.</HEAD>
<P>IN con&s;idering the human character with a view to improve it, it is prudent to en|deavour to di&s;cover the natural bent of the mind, and having found it, to apply your force to that &s;ide on which the warp lies, that you may le&s;&s;en by counteraction the defect which you might be otherwi&s;e pro|moting, by applying your aid in a contrary direction. But the misfortune is, people who mean better than they judge, are apt to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of a &s;et of general rules, good in them&s;elves, perhaps, and originally gleaned from experience and ob|&s;ervation on the nature of human things, but not applicable in all ca&s;es. The&s;e rules they keep by them as no&s;trums of univer&s;al efficacy, which they therefore
<PB N="95" REF="102">often u&s;e in ca&s;es to which they do not apply. For to make any remedy effectual it is not enough to know the medicine, you mu&s;t &s;tudy the con&s;titution al&s;o; for if there be not a congruity between the two, you may be injuring one patient by the means which are requi&s;ite to rai&s;e and re&s;tore another who&s;e temperament is of a contrary de&s;cription.</P>
<P>It is of importance in forming the female character that tho&s;e on whom this ta&s;k de|volves, &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o much penetration as accurately to di&s;cern its degree of &s;en|&s;ibility, and &s;o much judgment as to ac|commodate the treatment to the individual character. By con&s;tantly &s;timulating and extolling feelings naturally quick, tho&s;e feelings will be rendered too acute and irritable. On the other hand a calm and equable temper will become obtu&s;e by the total want of excitement; the former treatment converts the feelings into a &s;ource of error, agitation, and cala|mity, the latter &s;tarves their native energy,
<PB N="96" REF="103">deadens the affections, and produces a cold, dull, &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit; for the human mind is an in&s;trument which will lo&s;e its &s;weet|ne&s;s if &s;trained too high, and will be deprived of its tone and &s;trength if not &s;ufficiently rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>It is cruel to chill the precious &s;en&s;ibility of an ingenuous &s;oul, by treating with &s;upercilious coldne&s;s, and unfeeling ridi|cule, every indication of a warm, tender, di&s;intere&s;ted, and enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;pirit, as if it exhibited &s;ymptoms of a deficiency in under&s;tanding or prudence. How many are apt to intimate, with a &s;mile of mingled pity and contempt, that when &s;uch a one knows the world, that is, in other words, when &s;he &s;hall be grown cunning, &s;elfi&s;h, and &s;u&s;picious, &s;he will be a&s;hamed of her pre&s;ent glow of hone&s;t warmth, and of her lovely &s;u&s;ceptibility of heart. May &s;he never know the world, if the knowledge of it mu&s;t be acquired at &s;uch an expence! but to &s;en&s;ible hearts, every indication of genuine feeling will be
<PB N="97" REF="104">dear, for they will know that it is this temper which, by the guidance of the Divine Spirit, will make her one day become more enamoured of the beauty of holine&s;s; which, with the co-operation of principle, and under its direction, will render her the lively agent of Providence in dimini&s;hing the mi&s;ery that is in the world; into which mi&s;ery this temper will give her a quicker intuition than colder characters po&s;&s;e&s;s. It is this temper which, when it is touched and purified by a "live coal from the altar <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah, vi. 6.</NOTE>," will give her a keener ta&s;te for the &s;pirit of religion, and a quicker zeal in di&s;charg|ing its duties. But let it be remembered likewi&s;e, that as there is no quality in the female character which will be &s;o likely to endanger the peace and to expo&s;e the virtue of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; &s;o there is none which requires to have its luxuriances more carefully watched, and its wild &s;hoots more clo&s;ely looped.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="105">For young women of naturally warm affections, in whom tho&s;e affections have not been carefully di&s;ciplined, are in danger of incurring an unnatural irrita|bility; and while their happine&s;s falls a victim to the exce&s;s of uncontrolled feelings, they are liable at the &s;ame time to indulge a vanity of all others the mo&s;t prepo&s;terous, that of being vain of their defects. They have heard &s;en&s;ibility highly commended, without having heard any thing of tho&s;e bounds and fences which were intended to confine its ex|ce&s;&s;es, or without having been imbued with that principle which would have given it a beneficial direction; and, con|&s;cious that they po&s;&s;e&s;s the quality it&s;elf in the extreme, and not con&s;cious that they want all that makes that quality &s;afe and delightful, they plunge headlong into tho&s;e mi&s;eries from which they conceitedly imagine, that not principle but cold|ne&s;s has pre&s;erved the more &s;ober-minded and well in&s;tructed of their &s;ex.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="106">But as it would be foreign to the pre&s;ent de&s;ign to expatiate on tho&s;e &s;ad effects of ungoverned pa&s;&s;ion which terminate in criminal exce&s;&s;es, it is only intended here to hazard a few remarks on tho&s;e lighter &s;hades of the &s;ame defect, which injure the comfort without injuring the character, and impair the happine&s;s of life without incurring any very cen&s;urable degree of guilt or di&s;credit. Let it, how|ever, be incidentally remarked, and let it be carefully remembered, that if no women have ri&s;en &s;o high in the &s;cale of moral excellence as tho&s;e who&s;e natural warmth has been con&s;cientiou&s;ly governed by its true guide, and directed to its true end; &s;o none have furni&s;hed &s;uch deplorable in&s;tances of extreme depravity as tho&s;e who, through the ignorance or the deriliction of principle, have been abandoned by the exce&s;s of this very temper to the violence of ungoverned pa&s;&s;ions and uncon|trolled inclinations. And, perhaps, if we were to inquire into the remote cau&s;e
<PB N="100" REF="107">of &s;ome of the blacke&s;t crimes which &s;tain the annals of mankind, profligacy, mur|der, and e&s;pecially &s;uicide, we might trace them back to this original principle, an ungoverned Sen&s;ibility.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all the fine theories in pro&s;e and ver&s;e to which this topic has given birth, it will be found that very exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility contributes &s;o little to <HI>happine&s;s,</HI> and may yet be made to contri|bute &s;o much to <HI>u&s;efulne&s;s,</HI> that it may, perhaps, be con&s;idered as be&s;towed for an exerci&s;e to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or's own virtue, and as a keen inftrument with which he may better work for the good of others.</P>
<P>Women of this ca&s;t of mind are le&s;s careful to avoid the charge of unbounded extremes, than to e&s;cape at all events the imputation of in&s;en&s;ibility. They are little alarmed at the danger of <HI>exceeding,</HI> though terrified at the &s;u&s;picion of <HI>coming &s;hort</HI> of what they take to be the extreme point of feeling. They will even ro&s;olve to
<PB N="101" REF="108">prove the warmth of their &s;en&s;ibility, though at the expence of their judgment, and &s;ometimes al&s;o of their ju&s;tice. Even when they earne&s;tly de&s;ire to <HI>be</HI> and to <HI>do</HI> right, they are apt to employ the wrong in&s;trument to accompli&s;h the right end. They employ the pa&s;&s;ions to do the work of the judgment; forgetting, or not knowing, that the pa&s;&s;ions were not given us to be u&s;ed in the &s;earch and di&s;covery of truth, which is the office of a cooler and more di&s;criminating faculty; but that they were given to animate us to warmer zeal in the pur&s;uit and practice of truth, when the judgment &s;hall have pointed out what <HI>is</HI> truth.</P>
<P>Through this natural warmth, which they have been ju&s;tly told is &s;o plea&s;ing, but which, perhaps, they have not been told will be continually expo&s;ing them to peril and to &s;uffering, their joys and &s;or|rows are exce&s;&s;ive. Of this extreme irri|tability, as was before remarked, the ill|educated learn to boa&s;t as if it were an
<PB N="102" REF="109">indication of &s;uperiority of &s;oul, in&s;tead of labouring to re&s;train it as the exce&s;s of a temper which cea&s;es to be intere&s;ting when it is no longer under the control of the governing faculty. It is mis|fortune enough to be born more liable to &s;uffer and to &s;in, from this conform|ation of mind; it is too much to allow its unre&s;trained indulgence; it is &s;till wor&s;e to be proud of &s;o mi&s;leading a quality.</P>
<P>Flippancy, impetuo&s;ity, re&s;entment, and violence of &s;pirit, grow out of this di&s;|po&s;ition, which will be rather promoted than corrected, by the &s;y&s;tem of education on which we have been animadverting; in which &s;y&s;tem, emotions are too early and too much excited, and ta&s;tes and feel|ings are con&s;idered as too exclu&s;ively making up the whole of the female cha|racter; in which the judgment is little exerci&s;ed, the rea&s;oning powers are &s;eldom brought into action, and &s;elf-knowledge and &s;elf-denial &s;carcely included.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="110">The propen&s;ity of mind which we are con&s;idering, if unchecked, lays its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors open to unju&s;t prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and expo&s;es them to all the danger of unfounded at|tachments. In early youth, not only love, but friend&s;hip, at fir&s;t &s;ight, grows out of an ill-directed &s;en&s;ibility; and in after|life, women under the powerful influ|ence of this temper, con&s;cious that they have much to be borne with, are too readily inclined to &s;elect for their confiden|tial connections, flexible and flattering companions, who will indulge and per|haps admire their faults, rather than firm and hone&s;t friends, who will reprove and would a&s;&s;i&s;t in curing them. We may adopt it as a general maxim, that an obliging, weak, yielding, complai&s;ant friend, full of &s;mall attentions, with little religion, little judgment, and much natural acqui|e&s;cence and civility, is a mo&s;t dangerous, though generally a too much de&s;ired confidante: &s;he &s;oothes the indolence, and gratifies the vanity of her friend, by re|conciling
<PB N="104" REF="111">conciling her to her own faults, while &s;he neither keeps the under&s;tanding nor the virtues of that friend in exerci&s;e. The&s;e ob&s;equious qualities are the "&s;oft green <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burke's "Sublime and Beautiful."</NOTE>" on which the &s;oul loves to repo&s;e it&s;elf. But it is not a refre&s;hing or a whole&s;ome repo&s;e: we &s;hould not &s;elect, for the &s;ake of pre&s;ent ea&s;e, a &s;oothing flatterer, who will lull us into a plea&s;ing oblivion of our failings, but a friend, who, valuing our &s;oul's health above our immediate comfort, will rou&s;e us from torpid indulgence to animation, vigilance, and virtue.</P>
<P>An ill-directed &s;en&s;ibility leads a wo|man to be injudicious and eccentric in her <HI>charities</HI> al&s;o; &s;he will be in danger of proportioning her bounty to the im|mediate effect which the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed object produces on her &s;en&s;es: and &s;he will be more liberal to a &s;mall di&s;tre&s;s which pre&s;ents it&s;elf to her own eyes, than to the more pre&s;&s;ing wants and better claims
<PB N="105" REF="112">of tho&s;e mi&s;eries of which &s;he only hears the relation. There is a &s;ort of &s;tage effect which &s;ome people require for their charities; and &s;he will be apt too to de&s;ire, that the object of her compa&s;&s;ion &s;hall have &s;omething intere&s;ting and amiable in it, &s;uch as &s;hall furni&s;h plea&s;ing images and lively pictures to her imagination, and engaging &s;ubjects for de&s;cription; forgetting, that in her charities, as well as in every thing el&s;e, &s;he is to be a <Q>fol|lower of Him who plea&s;ed not him&s;elf;</Q> forgetting, that the mo&s;t coar&s;e and di&s;|gu&s;ting object is as much the repre&s;enta|tive of Him, who &s;aid, <Q>Ina&s;much as ye do it to one of the
lea&s;t of the&s;e, ye do it unto me,</Q> as the mo&s;t intere&s;ting: nay, the more uninviting and repul&s;ive ca&s;es may be better te&s;ts of the principle on which we relieve, than tho&s;e which abound more in pathos and intere&s;t, as we can have le&s;s &s;u&s;picion of our motive in the one ca&s;e than in the other: but, while we ought to neglect neither of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed
<PB N="106" REF="113">ca&s;es, yet the le&s;s our feelings are caught by plea&s;ing circum&s;tances, the le&s;s dan|ger we &s;hall be in of indulging &s;elf-com|placency, and the more likely we &s;hall be to do what we do for the &s;ake of Him who has promi&s;ed, that no deeds but what are performed on that principle, <Q>&s;hall be recompen&s;ed at the re&s;urrection of the ju&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>But through the want of that govern|ing principle which &s;hould direct her &s;en&s;ibility, a tender hearted woman, who&s;e hand, if &s;he be actually &s;urrounded with &s;cenes and circum&s;tances to call it into action, is Open as day to melting charity, yet her feelings being acted upon &s;olely by local circum&s;tances and pre&s;ent events, only remove her into another &s;cene, di&s;tant from the wants &s;he has been relieving; place her in the lap of indulgence, &s;o &s;urrounded with ea&s;e and plea&s;ure, &s;o im|mer&s;ed in the &s;oftne&s;s of life, that di&s;tre&s;s
<PB N="107" REF="114">no longer finds any acce&s;s to her pre&s;ence, but through the faint and unaffecting medium of a di&s;tant repre&s;entation: thus removed from the &s;ight and &s;ound of that mi&s;ery which, when pre&s;ent, &s;o ten|derly affected her, &s;he is apt to forget that mi&s;ery exi&s;ts; and as &s;he hears but little, and &s;ees nothing of want and &s;orrow, &s;he is ready to fancy that the world is grown happier than it was: in the meantime, with a quiet con&s;cience and a thoughtle&s;s vanity, &s;he has been lavi&s;hing on &s;uperflui|ties that money which &s;he would cheer|fully have given to a charitable ca&s;e, had &s;he not forgotten that any &s;uch were in exi&s;tence, becau&s;e <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> had blocked up the avenues through which mi&s;ery u&s;ed to find its way to her heart; and now, when again &s;uch a ca&s;e forces it&s;elf into her pre&s;ence, &s;he laments with real &s;incerity that the money is gone which &s;hould have relieved it.</P>
<P>In the meantime, perhaps, other women of le&s;s natural &s;ympathy, but
<PB N="108" REF="115">who&s;e &s;ympathies are under better regula|tion, or who act from a principle which requires little &s;timulus, have, by a con&s;tant cour&s;e of &s;elf-denial, by a con&s;tant atten|tion in refu&s;ing them&s;elves unnece&s;&s;ary indulgencies, and by guarding again&s;t that di&s;&s;olving PLEASURE which melts down the firme&s;t vittue that allows it&s;elf to ba&s;k in its beams, have been quietly furni&s;hing a regular provi&s;ion for mi&s;eries, which their knowledge of the &s;tate of the world tells them are every where to be found, and which their obedience to the will of God tells them it is their duty to find out and to relieve; and for the general expectation to be called upon to relieve which, the con&s;cientiou&s;ly chari|table will always be prepared.</P>
<P>On &s;uch a mind as we have been de|&s;cribing, <HI>Novelty</HI> al&s;o will operate with peculiar force, and in nothing more than in this article of charity. Old e&s;tabli&s;hed in&s;titutions, who&s;e continued exi&s;tence mu&s;t depend on the continued bounty of
<PB N="109" REF="116">that affluence to which they owed their origin, will be &s;ometimes neglected, as pre&s;enting no variety to the imagination, as having by their uniformity cea&s;ed to be intere&s;ting; and having of cour&s;e cea&s;ed to excite tho&s;e &s;prings of mere &s;en&s;itive feeling which &s;et the charity agoing, and which are no longer capable of awakening tho&s;e &s;udden emotions of tenderne&s;s and gu&s;ts of pity, which newer forms of di&s;tre&s;s are nece&s;&s;ary to excite afre&s;h. As age comes on, that charity which has been the effect of mere feeling, having been often di&s;appointed in its high expectations of the gratitude and &s;ub&s;equent merit of tho&s;e it has relieved, grows cold and rigid; and by withdrawing its bounty, becau&s;e &s;ome of its objects have been un|de&s;erving, it gives clear proof that what it be&s;towed was for its own gratification; and now finding that &s;elf-complacency at an end, it be&s;tows no longer. Probably too the cau&s;e of &s;o much di&s;appointment may have been the ill choice of the objects
<PB N="110" REF="117">which feeling has led them to make. The &s;ummer &s;howers of mere &s;en&s;ibility &s;oon dry up, while the living &s;pring of Chri&s;tian charity flows alike in all &s;ea&s;ons.</P>
<P>The impatience, levity, and ficklene&s;s, of which women have been &s;omewhat too generally accu&s;ed, are perhaps not a little &s;trengthened by the littlene&s;s and fri|volou&s;ne&s;s of female pur&s;uits. The &s;ort of education they commonly receive, teaches girls to &s;et a great price on &s;mall things. Be&s;ides this, they do not always learn to keep a very correct &s;cale of degrees for the value of the objects of their ad|miration and attachment; but by a kind of uncon&s;cious idolatry, they rather make a merit of loving <HI>&s;upremely</HI> things and per&s;ons which ought to be loved with moderation and in a &s;ubordinate degree the one to the other. Unluckily, they con&s;ider moderation as &s;o nece&s;&s;arily indi|cating a cold heart and narrow &s;oul, and they look upon a &s;tate of indifference with &s;o much horror, that either to love or hate
<PB N="111" REF="118">with energy is &s;uppo&s;ed by them to proceed from a higher &s;tate of mind than is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by more &s;teady and equable cha|racters. Whereas it is in fact the criterion of a warm but well directed &s;en&s;ibility, that while it is capable of loving with energy, it mu&s;t be enabled by the judg|ment which governs it, to &s;uit and adju&s;t its degree of intere&s;t to the nature and excellence of the object about which it is intere&s;ted; for unrea&s;onable prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, di&s;proportionate attachment, and capricious or precarious fondne&s;s, is not &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>Exce&s;&s;ive but unintentional <HI>flattery</HI> is another fault into which a &s;trong &s;en&s;i|bility is in danger of leading its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. A tender heart and a warm imagination con&s;pire to throw a &s;ort of radiance round the object of their love, till they are dazzled by a brightne&s;s of their own creating. The worldly and fa&s;hionable borrow the warm language of &s;en&s;ibility without having the &s;ame warm feeling;
<PB N="112" REF="119">and young ladies get &s;uch a habit of &s;aying, and e&s;pecially of writing, &s;uch over obliging and flattering things to each other, that this mutual politene&s;s, aided by the &s;elf-love &s;o natural to us all, and by an unwillingne&s;s to &s;earch into our own hearts, keeps up the illu&s;ion, and we get a habit of taking our character from the good we <HI>hear</HI> of our&s;elves, which others do not very well know, rather than from the evil we <HI>feel</HI> in our&s;elves, and which we therefore ought to be thoroughly ac|quainted with.</P>
<P>Ungoverned &s;en&s;ibility is apt to give a wrong direction to its anxieties; and its affection often falls &s;hort of the true end of friend&s;hip. If the object of its regard happen to be &s;ick, what inquiries! what pre&s;criptions! what an accumulation is made of ca&s;es in which the remedy its fondne&s;s &s;ugge&s;ts has been &s;ucce&s;sful! What an unaffected tenderne&s;s for the peri&s;hing body! Yet is this &s;en&s;ibility equally alive to the immortal intere&s;ts of
<PB N="113" REF="120">the &s;ufferer? Is it not &s;ilent and at ea&s;e when it contemplates the deare&s;t friend per&s;i&s;ting in opinions e&s;&s;entially dangerous; in practices unque&s;tionably wrong? Does it not view all this, not only without a a generous ardor to point out the peril and re&s;cue the friend; but if that friend be &s;uppo&s;ed to be dying, does it not even make it the <HI>criterion</HI> of kindne&s;s to let her die undeceived? What a want of true &s;en&s;ibility, to feel for the pain, but not for the danger of tho&s;e we love! Now &s;ee what &s;ort of &s;en&s;ibility the Bible teaches! <Q>Thou &s;halt not hate thy brother in thine heart, but thou &s;halt in any wi&s;e rebuke him, and &s;halt not &s;uffer &s;in upon him <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leviticus, xix. 17.</NOTE></Q> But let that tenderne&s;s which &s;hrinks from the idea of expo&s;ing what it loves to a mo|mentary pang, figure to it&s;elf the bare po&s;&s;ibility that the object of its own fond affection may not be the object of the
<PB N="114" REF="121">Divine favour! Let it &s;hrink from the bare conjecture that <Q>the familiar friend with whom it has taken &s;weet coun&s;el,</Q> is going down to the gates of death un|warned, unrepenting, unprepared!</P>
<P>But mere human &s;en&s;ibility goes a &s;horter way to work. Not being able to give its friend the pain of hearing her faults or of knowing her danger, it works it&s;elf up into the quieting delu&s;ion that no danger exi&s;ts, at lea&s;t not for the objects of its own affection; it gratifies it&s;elf by inventing a &s;alvation &s;o com|prehen&s;ive as &s;hall take in all it&s;elf loves with all their faults; it creates to its own fond heart an ideal and exaggerated divine mercy, which &s;hall pardon and receive all in whom it&s;elf has an intere&s;t, whether they be good or whether they be evil.</P>
<P>In regard to its application to religious purpo&s;es, it is a te&s;t that &s;en&s;ibility has received its true direction when it is &s;u|premely turned to the love of God: for to po&s;&s;e&s;s an overflowing fondne&s;s for our
<PB N="115" REF="122">fellow-creatures and fellow &s;inners, and to be cold and in&s;en&s;ible to the E&s;&s;ence of goodne&s;s and perfection, is an incon|&s;i&s;tency to which the feeling heart is awfully liable. God has him&s;elf the fir&s;t claim to the &s;en&s;ibility he be&s;towed. <Q>He <HI>fir&s;t</HI> loved us:</Q> this is a <HI>natural</HI> cau&s;e of love. <Q>He loved us while we were &s;inners:</Q> this is a <HI>&s;upernatural</HI> cau&s;e. He continues to love us though we neglect his favours, and &s;light his mercies: this would wear out any earthly kindne&s;s. He forgives us, not petty neglects, not occa&s;ional &s;lights; but grievous &s;ins, re|peated offences, broken vows, and un|requited love. What human friend&s;hip performs offices &s;o calculated to touch the &s;oul of &s;en&s;ibility?</P>
<P>Tho&s;e young women in whom feeling is indulged to the exclu&s;ion of rea&s;on and examination, are peculiarly liable to be the dupes of prejudice, ra&s;h deci&s;ions, and fal&s;e judgment. The under&s;tanding hav|ing but little power over the will, their
<PB N="116" REF="123">affections are not well poized, and their minds are kept in a &s;tate ready to be acted upon by the fluctuations of alternate impul&s;es; by &s;udden and varying im|pre&s;&s;ions; by ca&s;ual and contradictory circum&s;tances; and by emotions excited by every accident. In&s;tead of being guided by the broad views of general truth, and having one fixed principle, they are driven on by the impetuo&s;ity of the moment. And this impetuo&s;ity blinds the judgment as much as it mi&s;leads the conduct; &s;o that, for want of a habit of cool inve&s;tigation and inquiry, they meet every event with|out any previou&s;ly formed opinion or rule of action. And as they do not accu&s;tom them&s;elves to appreciate the real value of things, their attention is as likely to be led away by the under parts of a &s;ubject, as to &s;eize on the leading feature. The &s;ame eagerne&s;s of mind which hinders the operation of the di&s;criminating fa|culties, leads al&s;o to the error of deter|mining on the rectitude of an action by its
<PB N="117" REF="124">&s;ucce&s;s, and to that of making the event of an undertaking decide on its ju&s;tice or propriety: it al&s;o leads to that &s;uper|ficial and erroneous way of judging which fa&s;tens on exceptions, if they make in one's own favour, as grounds of rea&s;oning, while they lead us to overlook received and general rules which tend to e&s;tabli&s;h a doctrine contrary to their wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Open hearted, indi&s;creet girls, often pick up a few &s;trong notions which are as fal&s;e in them&s;elves as they are popular among the cla&s;s in que&s;tion: &s;uch as, <Q>that warm friends mu&s;t make warm enemies;</Q>&mdash;that <Q>the generous love and hate with all their hearts;</Q>&mdash;that <Q>a reformed rake makes the be&s;t hu&s;band;</Q> &mdash;that <Q>there is no medium in marriage, but that it is a &s;tate of exqui&s;ite happi|ne&s;s, or exqui&s;ite mi&s;ery;</Q> with many other doctrines of equal currency and equal &s;oundne&s;s. The&s;e they con&s;ider as axioms, and adopt as rules of life. From the two fir&s;t of the&s;e oracular &s;ayings girls
<PB N="118" REF="125">are in no &s;mall danger of becoming unju&s;t through the very warmth of their hearts: for they will get a habit of making their e&s;timate of the good or ill qualities of others, merely in proportion to the greater or le&s;s degree of kindne&s;s which they them&s;elves have received from them. Their e&s;timation of general character is thus formed on in&s;ulated and partial grounds; on the accidental circum&s;tance of per&s;onal predilection or per&s;onal pique. Kindne&s;s to them&s;elves or their friends involves all po&s;&s;ible excellence; neglect includes all imaginable defects. Friend&s;hip and grati|tude can and &s;hould go a great way; but as they cannot convert vice into virtue, &s;o they ought never to convert truth into fal&s;ehood. And it may be the more nece&s;&s;ary to be upon our guard in this in&s;tance, becau&s;e the very idea of gratitude may mi&s;lead us, by converting inju&s;tice into the &s;emblance of a virtue. Warm expre&s;&s;ions therefore &s;hould be limited to the conveying a &s;en&s;e of our own
<PB N="119" REF="126">individual obligations which are real, rather than employed to give an impre&s;&s;ion of general excellence in the per&s;on who has obliged us, which may be imaginary. A good man is &s;till good though it may not have fallen in his way to oblige or &s;erve us; nay, though he may have neglected or even unintentionally hurt us; and &s;in is &s;till &s;in though committed by the per&s;on in the world we be&s;t love, and to whom we are mo&s;t obliged.</P>
<P>We come next to that fatal and mo&s;t indelicate, nay gro&s;s maxim, that a re|formed rake makes the be&s;t hu&s;band; an aphori&s;m to which the principles and the happine&s;s of &s;o many young women have been &s;acrificed. It goes upon the pre|po&s;terous &s;uppo&s;ition, not only that effects do not follow cau&s;es, but that they oppo&s;e them; on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that habitual vice creates rectitude of character, and that &s;in produces happine&s;s: thus flatly contradicting what the moral government of God uniformly exhibits in the cour&s;e of
<PB N="120" REF="127">human events, and what revelation &s;o evidently and univer&s;ally teaches.</P>
<P>For it &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that the reformation is generally, if not always &s;uppo&s;ed to be brought about by the all|conquering force of female charms. Let but a profligate young man have a point to carry by winning the affections of a vain and thoughtle&s;s girl; he will begin his attack upon her heart by undermining her religious principles, and artfully removing every impediment which might have ob|&s;tructed her receiving the addre&s;&s;es of a man without character. And while he will lead her, not to hear named with|out ridicule that change of heart which Scripture teaches and experience proves the power of Divine grace can work on a vicious character; while he will teach her to &s;neer at a change which he would treat with contempt, as a really miraculous conver&s;ion; yet he will not &s;cruple to &s;wear that the power of her beauty has worked an in&s;tantaneous and equally com|plete
<PB N="121" REF="128">revolution in his own loo&s;e prac|tice.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing it po&s;&s;ible that his re|formation were genuine, it would even then by no means involve the truth of her propo&s;ition, that pa&s;t libertini&s;m in|&s;ures future felicity; yet many a weak girl, confirmed in this palatable doctrine, by examples &s;he has frequently admired of the&s;e &s;urpri&s;ing reformations, &s;o con|veniently effected in the la&s;t &s;cene of mo&s;t of our comedies, has not &s;crupled to ri&s;k her earthly and eternal happine&s;s with a man, who is not a&s;hamed to a&s;cribe to the influence of her beauty that power of changing the heart which he impiou&s;ly denies to Omnipotence it&s;elf.</P>
<P>As to the la&s;t of the&s;e practical apho|ri&s;ms, <Q>that there is no medium in marriage, but that it is a &s;tate of exqui|&s;ite happine&s;s or exqui&s;ite mi&s;ery;</Q> this, though not equally &s;inful, is equally de|lu&s;ive: for marriage is only one certain modification of human life, and human
<PB N="122" REF="129">life is not commonly in it&s;elf a &s;tate of exqui&s;ite extremes; but is u&s;ually that mixed and moderate &s;tate, &s;o naturally dreaded by tho&s;e who &s;et out with fancy|ing this world a &s;tate of rapture, and &s;o naturally expected by tho&s;e who know it to be a &s;tate of probation and di&s;cipline. Marriage, therefore, is only one condition, and often the be&s;t condition, of that im|perfect &s;tate of being which, though &s;eldom very exqui&s;ite, is often very toler|able; and which may yield much comfort to tho&s;e who do not look for con&s;tant tran&s;port. But unfortunately, tho&s;e who find them&s;elves di&s;appointed of the un|cea&s;ing raptures they had anticipated in marriage, di&s;daining to &s;it down with &s;o poor a provi&s;ion as comfort, and &s;corning the acceptance of that moderate lot which Providence commonly be&s;tows, with a view to check de&s;pondency and to repre&s;s pre&s;umption; give them&s;elves up to the other alternative; and, by abandoning their hearts to di&s;content, make to them|&s;elves
<PB N="123" REF="130">that mi&s;ery with which their fervid imaginations had filled the oppo&s;ite &s;cale.</P>
<P>The truth is, the&s;e young ladies are very apt to pick up their opinions, le&s;s from the divines than the poets; and the poets, though it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed they are &s;ome of the be&s;t embelli&s;hers of life, are not <HI>quite</HI> the &s;afe&s;t conducters through it: as in travelling through a wilderne&s;s, though we avail our&s;elves of the harmony of &s;inging birds, to render the grove delightful, yet we never think of following them as guides, to conduct us through its labyrinths.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e women, in whom the natural defects of temper have been &s;trengthened by an education which fo&s;ters their faults, are very dextrous in availing them|&s;elves of a hint, when it favours a ruling inclination, &s;oothes vanity, indulges in|dolence, or gratifies their love of power. They have heard &s;o often from their favourite &s;entimental authors, and their more flattering male friends, <Q>that when
<PB N="124" REF="131">nature denied them &s;trength, &s;he gave them facinating graces in compen&s;ation; that their &s;trength con&s;i&s;ts in their weakne&s;s;</Q> and that <Q>they are en|dowed with arts of per&s;ua&s;ion which &s;upply the ab&s;ence of force, and the place of rea&s;on;</Q> that they learn, in time, to pride them&s;elves on that very weakne&s;s, and to become vain of their imperfections; till at length they begin to claim for their defects, not only pardon, but admiration. Hence they get to cheri&s;h a &s;pecies of feeling which, if not checked, terminates in exce&s;&s;ive &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s; they learn to produce their inability to bear contradiction as a proof of their tender|ne&s;s; and to indulge in that &s;ort of irri|tability, in all that relates to them&s;elves, which inevitably leads to the utter ex|clu&s;ion of all intere&s;t in the &s;ufferings of others. In&s;tead of exerci&s;ing their &s;en|&s;ibility in the whole&s;ome duty of relieving di&s;tre&s;s and vi&s;iting &s;cenes of &s;orrow, that &s;en&s;ibility it&s;elf is pleaded as a rea&s;on for
<PB N="125" REF="132">their not being able to endure &s;ights of woe, and for &s;hunning the di&s;tre&s;s it &s;hould be exerted in removing. That exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;e of feeling which God im|planted in the heart as a &s;timulus to quicken us in relieving the mi&s;eries of others, is thus introverted, and learns to con&s;ider <HI>&s;elf</HI> not as the agent, but the object of compa&s;&s;ion. Tenderne&s;s is made an excu&s;e for being hard-hearted; and in&s;tead of drying the weeping eyes of others, this fal&s;e delicacy re&s;erves its own &s;elfi&s;h tears for the more elegant and le&s;s expen&s;ive &s;orrows of the melting novel or the pathetic tragedy.</P>
<P>When feeling &s;timulates only to &s;elf-indulgence; when the more exqui&s;ite affections of &s;ympathy and pity evaporate in &s;entiment, in&s;tead of flowing out in active charity, exerting it&s;elf in all the various &s;hapes of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, protection, or con&s;olation for every &s;pecies of di&s;tre&s;s; it is an evidence that the feeling is of a
<PB N="126" REF="133">&s;purious kind; and in&s;tead of being nou|ri&s;hed as an amiable tenderne&s;s, it &s;hould be &s;ubdued as a fond and ba&s;e &s;elf-love.</P>
<P>That idlene&s;s, to who&s;e cruel inroads many women of fortune are unhappily expo&s;ed, from not having been trained to con&s;ider whole&s;ome occupation, vigorous exertion, and &s;y&s;tematic employment as making part of the indi&s;pen&s;able duties of life, lays them open to a thou&s;and evils of this kind, from which the u&s;eful and the bu&s;y are exempted: and, perhaps, it would not be ea&s;y to find a more pitiable object than a woman with a great deal of time and a great deal of money on her hands, who, never having been taught the con&s;cientious u&s;e of either, &s;quanders both at random, or rather moulders both away, without plan, without principle, and without plea&s;ure; all who&s;e projects begin and terminate in &s;elf; who con|&s;iders the re&s;t of the world only as they may be &s;ub&s;ervient to her gratification;
<PB N="127" REF="134">and to whom it never occurred, that both her time and money were given for the gratification and good of others.</P>
<P>It is not much to the credit of the other &s;ex, that they now and then lend them&s;elves to the indulgence of this &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit in their wives, and cheri&s;h by a kind of fal&s;e fondne&s;s tho&s;e faults which &s;hould be combated by good &s;en&s;e and a rea&s;on|able counteraction; &s;lothfully preferring a little fal&s;e peace, the purcha&s;e of pre|carious quiet, and the reputation of good nature, to the higher duty of forming the mind, fixing the principles, and &s;trengthening the character of her with whom they are connected. Perhaps too, a little vanity in the hu&s;band helps out his good nature; he &s;ecretly rewards him|&s;elf by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his &s;uperiority; he feels a &s;elf-complacency in his patient conde&s;cen&s;ion to her weakne&s;s, which tacitly flatters his own &s;trength: and he is, as it were, paid for &s;tooping by the increa&s;ed &s;en&s;e of his own tallne&s;s. Seeing
<PB N="128" REF="135">al&s;o, perhaps, but little of other women, he gets to believe that they are all pretty much alike, and that, as a man of &s;en&s;e, he mu&s;t content him&s;elf with what he takes to be the common lot. Whereas, in truth, by his mi&s;placed indulgence, he has rather <HI>made</HI> his own lot than <HI>drawn</HI> it; and thus, through an indolent de&s;pair in the hu&s;band of being able to improve by oppo&s;ing them, it happens that help|le&s;s, fretful, and daudling wives often acquire a more powerful a&s;cendancy than the mo&s;t di&s;creet and amiable women; and that the mo&s;t ab&s;olute female tyranny is e&s;tabli&s;hed by the&s;e &s;ickly and caprici|ous humours.</P>
<P>The poets again, who, to do them ju&s;tice, are always ready to lend a helping hand when any mi&s;chief is to be done, have contributed their full &s;hare towards confirming the&s;e feminine follies: they have &s;trengthened by adulatory maxims, &s;ung in &s;educing &s;trains, tho&s;e faults which their talents and their influence
<PB N="129" REF="136">&s;hould have been employed in correcting. When fair and youthful females are com|plimented with being Fine by defect and delicately weak! Is not a &s;tandard of feeblene&s;s held out to them to which vanity will gladly re&s;ort, and to which &s;oftne&s;s and indolence can ea&s;ily act up, or rather <HI>act down,</HI> if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P>When ladies are told by the &s;ame mi&s;leading, but to them high, authority, that <Q>&s;miles and tears are the irre&s;i&s;tible arms with which Nature has furni&s;hed them for conquering the &s;trong,</Q> will they not eagerly fly to this cheap and ready artillery, in&s;tead of labouring to furni&s;h them&s;elves with a rea&s;onable mind, an equable temper, and a meek and quiet &s;pirit?</P>
<P>Every animal is endowed by Providence with the peculiar powers adapted to its nature and its wants; while none, except the human, by grafting art on natural
<PB N="130" REF="137">&s;agacity, injures or mars the gift. Spoi&s;t women, who fancy there is &s;omething more <HI>picquant</HI> and alluring in the mutable graces of caprice, than in the monotonous &s;moothne&s;s of an even temper, and who al&s;o having heard much, as was ob&s;erved before, about their "amiable weakne&s;s," learn to look about them for the be&s;t &s;uccedaneum to &s;trength, the &s;uppo&s;ed ab&s;ence of which they &s;ometimes endea|vour to &s;upply by artifice. By this engine the weake&s;t woman frequently furni&s;hes the conver&s;e to the famous reply of the French Mini&s;ter, who, when he was accu&s;ed of governing the mind of that feeble Queen Mary de Medicis by &s;orcery, replied, <Q>that the only &s;orcery he had u&s;ed was that influence which &s;trong minds na|turally have over weak ones.</Q></P>
<P>But though it be fair &s;o to &s;tudy the tempers, defects, and weakne&s;&s;es of others as to convert our knowledge of them to the promotion of their benefit and our own; and though it be making a lawful
<PB N="131" REF="138">u&s;e of our penetration to avail our&s;elves of the faults of others for <Q>their good to edification;</Q> yet all deviations from the &s;trait line of truth and &s;implicity; every plot in&s;idiou&s;ly to turn influence to unfair account; all contrivances to extort from a bribed complai&s;ance what rea&s;on and ju&s;tice would refu&s;e to our wi&s;hes; the&s;e are &s;ome of the operations of that lowe&s;t and mo&s;t de&s;picable engine, &s;elfi&s;h cunning, by which <HI>little minds &s;ometimes govern great ones.</HI></P>
<P>And unluckily, women, from their natural de&s;ire to plea&s;e, and from their &s;ometimes doubting by what means this grand end may be be&s;t effected, are in more danger of being led into di&s;&s;imu|lation than men; for di&s;&s;imulation is the re&s;ult of weakne&s;s, and the refuge of doubt and di&s;tru&s;t, rather than of con&s;cious &s;trength, the dangers of which lie another way. Frankne&s;s, truth, and &s;implicity, therefore, as they are inexpre&s;&s;ibly charm|ing,
<PB N="132" REF="139">&s;o are they peculiarly commendable in women, and nobly evince that while they wi&s;h to plea&s;e, (and why &s;hould they not wi&s;h it?) they di&s;dain to have recour&s;e to any thing but what is fair, and ju&s;t, and honorable to effect it; that they &s;corn to attain the mo&s;t de&s;ired end by any but the mo&s;t lawful means. The beauty of &s;im|plicity is indeed &s;o intimately felt and generally acknowledged by all who have a true ta&s;te for per&s;onal, moral, or intellectual beauty, that women of the deepe&s;t artifice often find their account in a&s;&s;uming an exterior the mo&s;t foreign to their character, and by affecting the mo&s;t &s;tudied <HI>naivet&eacute;.</HI> It is curious to &s;ee the quantity of <HI>art</HI> &s;ome people put in practice in order to appear <HI>natural;</HI> and the deep <HI>de&s;ign</HI> which is &s;et at work to exhibit <HI>&s;implicity.</HI> And indeed this feigned &s;implicity is the mo&s;t mi&s;|chievous, becau&s;e the mo&s;t engaging of all the Proteus forms which di&s;&s;imulation can put on. For the mo&s;t free and bold &s;enti|ments
<PB N="133" REF="140">have been &s;ometimes hazarded with fatal &s;ucce&s;s under this un&s;u&s;pected ma&s;k.

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. <HI>On di&s;&s;ipation and the modern habits of fa&s;hionable life.</HI></HEAD>
<P>PERHAPS the intere&s;ts of true friend&s;hip, elegant conver&s;ation, mental improvement, &s;ocial plea&s;ure, maternal duty, and con|jugal comfort, never received &s;uch a blow as when Fa&s;hion i&s;&s;ued out that arbitrary and univer&s;al decree, that <HI>every body mu&s;t be acquainted with every body;</HI> together with that con&s;equent, authoritative, but rather inconvenient clau&s;e, that <HI>every body mu&s;t al&s;o go every where every night.</HI> The devout obedience paid to this law is in|compatible with the very being of friend|&s;hip; for as the circle of acquaintance expands, and it will be continually expand|ing, the affections will be beaten out into &s;uch thin lamina as to leave little &s;olidity
<PB N="135" REF="144">remaining. The heart which is continually exhau&s;ting it&s;elf in profe&s;&s;ions grows cold and hard. The feelings of kindne&s;s di|mini&s;h in proportion as the expre&s;&s;ion of kindne&s;s becomes more diffu&s;e and indi&s;|criminate. The very traces of <Q>&s;impli|city and godly &s;incerity</Q> in a delicate female, wear away imperceptibly by con|&s;tant colli&s;ion with the world at large. And perhaps no woman takes &s;o little intere&s;t in the happine&s;s of her real friends, as &s;he who&s;e affections are ince&s;&s;antly eva|porating in univer&s;al civilities; as &s;he who is &s;aying fond and flattering things at random to a circle of five hundred every night.</P>
<P>The decline and fall of animated and in&s;tructive conver&s;ation has been in a good mea&s;ure effected by this barbarous project of a&s;&s;embling <HI>en ma&s;&s;e.</HI> An excellent pre|late <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The late Bi&s;hop Horne.</NOTE> with who&s;e friend&s;hip the author was long honoured, and who him&s;elf excelled
<PB N="136" REF="145">in the art of conver&s;ation, u&s;ed to remark, that a few years had brought about a great revolution in the manners of &s;ociety: that it u&s;ed to be the cu&s;tom, previou&s;ly to going into company, to think that &s;omething was to be communicated or received, taught or learnt; that the powers of the under&s;tanding were expected to be brought into exerci&s;e, and that it was therefore nece&s;&s;ary to quicken the mind, by reading and thinking, for the &s;hare the individual might be expected to take in the general di&s;cour&s;e; but that knowledge, and ta&s;te, and wit, and erudition, &s;eemed now to be &s;carcely con&s;idered as nece&s;&s;ary materials to be brought into the plea&s;ure|able commerce of the world; in which there was little chance of turning them to much account; and therefore he who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them, and he who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them not, were nearly on a footing.</P>
<P>It is obvious al&s;o that multitudinous a&s;&s;emblies are &s;o little favourable to that <HI>cheerfulne&s;s</HI> which it &s;hould &s;eem to be their
<PB N="137" REF="146">very end to promote, that if there were any chemical proce&s;s by which the quantum of &s;pirits animal or intellectual could be a&s;certained the diminution would be found to have been inconceivably great, &s;ince the transformation of man and woman from a &s;ocial to a gregarious animal.</P>
<P>But if it be true as to the injury which friend&s;hip, &s;ociety, and cheerfulne&s;s, have &s;u&s;tained by this change of manners, how much more pointedly does the remark apply to family happine&s;s!</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the known fluctuation of manners and the mutability of language, could it be fore&s;een, when the Apo&s;tle Paul exhorted <Q>married women to be keepers <HI>at home,</HI></Q> that the time would arrive when that very phra&s;e would be &s;elected to de&s;ignate one of the mo&s;t decided acts of di&s;&s;ipation? Could it be fore&s;een that when a fine lady &s;hould &s;end out a notification that on &s;uch a night &s;he &s;hall be AT HOME, the&s;e two words (be|&s;ides intimating the rarity of the thing)
<PB N="138" REF="147">would pre&s;ent to the mind an image the mo&s;t <HI>undome&s;tic</HI> which language can convey? My country readers, who may require to have it explained that the&s;e two magnetic words now po&s;&s;e&s;s the powerful influence of drawing together every thing <HI>fine</HI> within the &s;phere of their attraction, may need al&s;o to be apprized, that the gue&s;ts afterwards are not a&s;ked what was <HI>&s;aid</HI> by the company, but whether the <HI>crowd</HI> was prodigious? The rule for de|ciding on the merit of a fa&s;hionable &s;ociety not being by the ta&s;te or the &s;pirit, but by the <HI>&s;core</HI> and the <HI>hundred.</HI> The que&s;tion of plea&s;ure, like a Parliamentary que&s;tion, is now carried by numbers. And when two parties modi&s;h, like two parties poli|tical, are run one again&s;t another on the &s;ame night, the &s;ame kind of mortification attends the leader of a defeated minority, the &s;ame triumph attends the exulting carrier of &s;uperior numbers, in the one ca&s;e as in the other.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="148">An eminent divine has &s;aid, that <Q>per|&s;everance in prayer will either make a man leave off &s;inning, or a conti|nuance in &s;in will make him leave off prayer.</Q> This remark may be accom|modated to tho&s;e ladies who, while they are devoted to the enjoyments of the world, yet retain con&s;iderable &s;olicitude for the in&s;truction of their daughters. But if they are really in earne&s;t to give them a Chri&s;tian education, they mu&s;t them&s;elves renounce a di&s;&s;ipated life. Or if they re&s;olve to pur&s;ue the chace of plea&s;ure they mu&s;t renounce this prime duty. Con|traries cannot unite. The moral nurture of a tall daughter can no more be ad|mini&s;tered by a mother who&s;e time is ab&s;orbed by crowds abroad, than the phy&s;i|cal nurture of her infant offspring can be &s;upplied by her in a perpetual ab&s;ence from home.

<PB N="140" REF="149">and then to de&s;ert her po&s;t when the more important moral and intellectual cravings require &s;u&s;tenance?

<P>The u&s;ual vindication, and in theory it has a plau&s;ible &s;ound, which has been offered for the large portion of time &s;pent by women in acquiring ornamental talents is, that they are calculated to make the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or love home, and that they in|nocently fill up the hours of lei&s;ure. The plea has indeed &s;o promi&s;ing an appear|ance that it is worth inquiring whether it be in fact true. Do we then, on fairly pur&s;uing the inquiry, di&s;cover that tho&s;e who have &s;pent mo&s;t time in &s;uch light acqui&s;itions, are really remarkable for lov|ing
<PB N="141" REF="150">home or &s;taying quietly there? or that when there, they are &s;edulous in turn|ing time to the be&s;t account? I &s;peak not of that rational and re&s;pectable cla&s;s of women, who, applying (as many of them do) the&s;e elegant talents to their true pur|po&s;e, employ them to fill up the vacancies of better occupations, and to embelli&s;h the lei&s;ure of a life actively good. But do we <HI>generally</HI> &s;ee that even the mo&s;t valu|able and &s;ober part of the reigning female acqui&s;itions leads their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to &s;cenes mo&s;t favourable to the enjoyment of them? to &s;cenes which we &s;hould naturally &s;up|po&s;e &s;he would &s;eek, in order to the more effectual cultivation of &s;uch rational plea|&s;ures?</P>
<P>Would not tho&s;e delightful pur&s;uits, botany and drawing, for in&s;tance, &s;eem likely to court the fields, the woods, and gardens of the paternal &s;eat, as more con|genial to their nature, and more appro|priate to their exerci&s;e, than barren water|ing places, de&s;titute of a tree, or an herb,
<PB N="142" REF="151">or a flower, or an hour's interval from &s;ucce&s;&s;ive plea&s;ures, to pro&s;it by them even if they abounded with the whole vegetable world from the <Q>Cedar of Le|banon to the Hy&s;&s;op on the wall.</Q></P>
<P>From the mention of watering places, may the author be allowed to &s;ugge&s;t a few remarks on the evils which have ari&s;en from the general con&s;piracy of the gay to u&s;urp the regions of the &s;ick; and converting the health-re&s;toring foun|tains, meant as a refuge for di&s;ea&s;e, into the re&s;orts of vanity for tho&s;e who have no di&s;ea&s;e but idlene&s;s?</P>
<P>This inability of &s;taying at home, as it is one of the mo&s;t infallible, &s;o it is one of the mo&s;t dangerous &s;ymptoms of the reigning mania. It would be more tolerable, did this epidemic malady only break out as formerly, during the winter, or &s;ome one &s;ea&s;on. Heretofore, the tenantry and the poor, the natural de|pendents on the rural man&s;ions of the opulent, had &s;ome definite period to which
<PB N="143" REF="152">they might joyfully look forward for the approach of tho&s;e patrons, part of who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s in life it is, to influence by their pre&s;ence, to in&s;truct by their example, to &s;ooth by their kindne&s;s, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t by their liberality, tho&s;e, whom Providence in the di&s;tribution of human lots, has placed under their more immediate pro|tection. Though it would be far from truth to a&s;&s;ert that di&s;&s;ipated people are never charitable, yet I will venture to &s;ay, that di&s;&s;ipation is incon&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of charity. That affecting precept followed by &s;o gracious a promi&s;e, <Q>Never turn away thy face from any poor man, and then the face of the Lord &s;hall never be turned away from thee,</Q> cannot literally mean that we &s;hould <HI>give</HI> to all, as then we &s;hould &s;oon have nothing left to give: but it &s;eems to intimate the habitual attention, the duty of inquiring out all ca&s;es of di&s;tre&s;s, in order to judge which are fit to be relieved; now for this inquiry
<PB N="144" REF="153">the di&s;&s;ipated have little ta&s;te and le&s;s lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>Let a rea&s;onable conjecture (for calcu|lation would fail!) be made of how large a dimunition of the general good has been effected in this &s;ingle re&s;pect, by cau&s;es, which, though they do not &s;eem import|ant in them&s;elves, yet make no incon&s;ider|able part of the mi&s;chief ari&s;ing from modern manners: and I &s;peak now to per&s;ons who <HI>intend</HI> to be charitable. What a deduction will be made from the aggre|gate of charity, by a circum&s;tance appa|rently tri&s;ling, when we con&s;ider what would be the beneficial effects of that regular bounty which mu&s;t almo&s;t un|avoidably re&s;ult from the evening walks of a great and benevolent family among the cottages of their own domain: the thou&s;and little acts of, comparatively, un|expen&s;ive kindne&s;s which the <HI>&s;ight</HI> of petty wants and difficulties would excite; wants, which will &s;carcely be felt in the
<PB N="145" REF="154">relation; and which will probably be neither &s;een, nor felt, nor fairly repre|&s;ented, in their long ab&s;ences, by an agent. And what is even almo&s;t more than the good done, is the habit of mind kept up in tho&s;e who do it: would not this habit exerci&s;ed on the Chri&s;tian prin|ciple, that "even a cup of cold water," given upon <HI>right motives,</HI> &s;hall not lo&s;e its reward; while the giving <Q>all their goods to feed the poor,</Q> without the true <HI>principle</HI> of charity &s;hall profit them nothing; would not this habit, I &s;ay, be almo&s;t the be&s;t part of the education of daughters <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It would be a plea&s;ant &s;ummer amu&s;ement for our young ladies of fortune, if they were to pre&s;ide at &s;uch &s;pinning fea&s;ts as are in&s;tituted at Nuneham for the promotion of virtue and indu&s;try in their own &s;ex. Plea&s;urable anniver&s;aries of this kind would &s;erve to combine in the minds of the poor two ideas, which ought never to be &s;eparated, but which <HI>they</HI> are not very forward to unite, &mdash;that the great wi&s;h to make them <HI>happy</HI> as well as good. Occa|&s;ional approximations of the rich and poor, for the purpo&s;es of relief and in&s;truction, and annual meetings for the purpo&s;e of innocent plea&s;ure, would do much towards wearing away di&s;content, and contribute to reconcile the lower cla&s;s to that &s;tate in which it has plea&s;ed God to place them.</NOTE>?</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="155">But tran&s;plant this wealthy and boun|tiful family periodically amid&s;t the frivo|lous and unintere&s;ting bu&s;tle of the water|ing place; where it is not denied that frequent public and fa&s;hionable acts of charity may make a part, and it is well they do make part, of the bu&s;ine&s;s and of the amu&s;ement of the day; with this latter, indeed, they are &s;ometimes good|naturedly mixed up. But how &s;hall we compare the regular &s;y&s;tematical good the&s;e per&s;ons would be doing at their own home, with the light, and amu&s;ing, and bu&s;tling bounties of the&s;e public places? The illegal raffle at the toy-&s;hop, for &s;ome di&s;tre&s;s, which though it may be real, and which if real ought to be re|lieved, is yet le&s;s ea&s;ily a&s;certained than
<PB N="147" REF="156">the wants of their own poor, or the debts of their di&s;tre&s;&s;ed tenants. How &s;hall we compare the broad &s;tream of bounty which &s;hould be flowing through and re|fre&s;hing whole di&s;tricts, with the penu|rious current of the &s;ub&s;cription breakfa&s;t for the needy mu&s;ician, in which the price of the gift is taken out in the diver&s;ion, and in which plea&s;ure dignifies it&s;elf with the name of bounty? How &s;hall we com|pare the attention, and time, and zeal which would otherwi&s;e, perhaps, be de|voted to the village &s;chool, &s;pent in hawk|ing about benefit tickets for a broken player, while the kindne&s;s of the benefac|tre&s;s, perhaps, is rewarded by &s;cenes in which her charity is not always repaid by the purity of the exhibition.</P>
<P>Far be it from the author to wi&s;h to check the full tide of charity wherever it is di&s;po&s;ed to flow! Would &s;he could mul|tiply the already abundant &s;treams, and behold every &s;ource purified! But in the public re&s;orts there are many who are
<PB N="148" REF="157">able and willing to give. In the &s;eque&s;|tered, though populous village, there is, perhaps, only one affluent family: the di&s;|tre&s;s which they do not <HI>behold,</HI> will proba|bly not be attended to: the di&s;tre&s;s which <HI>they</HI> do not relieve will probably not be relieved at all: the wrongs which <HI>they</HI> do not redre&s;s will go unredre&s;&s;ed: the op|pre&s;&s;ed whom <HI>they</HI> do not re&s;cue will &s;ink under the tyranny of the oppre&s;&s;or. Through their own rural domains too, charity runs in a clearer current, and is le&s;s polluted with any &s;u&s;picion of that muddy tincture which it is &s;ometimes apt to contract in pa&s;&s;ing through the impure &s;oil of the world.</P>
<P>But to return from this too long digre&s;|&s;ion: the old &s;tanding objection formerly brought forward by the prejudices of the other &s;ex, and too eagerly laid hold on as a &s;helter for indolence and ignorance by ours, was, that intellectual accompli&s;h|ments too much ab&s;orbed the thoughts and affections, took women off from the
<PB N="149" REF="158">nece&s;&s;ary attention to dome&s;tic duties, and &s;uperinduced a contempt or neglect of whatever was u&s;eful.&mdash;But it is peculiarly the character of the pre&s;ent day to detect ab|&s;urd opinions, and expo&s;e plau&s;ible theories by the &s;imple and deci&s;ive an&s;wer of experi|ment; and it is pre&s;umed that this popu|lar error, as well as others, is daily re|ceiving the refutation of actual experience. For it cannot &s;urely be maintained on ground that is any longer tenable, that acquirements truly rational are calculated to draw off the mind from real duties. Whatever removes prejudices, whatever &s;timulates indu&s;try, whatever rectifies the judgment, whatever corrects &s;elf-con|ceit, whatever purifies the ta&s;te, and rai&s;es the under&s;tanding, will be likely to contri|bute to moral excellence: to woman moral excellence is the grand object of education; and of moral excellence, dome&s;|tic life is to woman the appropriate &s;phere.</P>
<P>Count over the li&s;t of females who have made &s;hipwreck of their fame and virtue,
<PB N="150" REF="159">and have furni&s;hed the mo&s;t lamentable examples of the dereliction of family duties; and the number will not be found con|&s;iderable who have been led a&s;tray by the pur&s;uit of knowledge. And if a few de|plorable in&s;tances of this kind be produced, it will commonly be found that there was little infu&s;ion in the minds of &s;uch women of that correcting principle without which all other knowledge only "puffeth up."</P>
<P>The time nightly expended in late female vigils is expended by the light of far other lamps than tho&s;e which are fed by the &s;tudent's oil; and if families <HI>are</HI> to be found who are neglected through too much &s;tudy in the mi&s;tre&s;s, it will probably be proved to be Hoyle, and not Homer, who has robbed her children of her time and affections. For one family which has been neglected by the mother's pa&s;&s;ion for books, an hundred have been de&s;erted through her pa&s;&s;ion for play. The hu&s;|band of a fa&s;hionable woman will not often find that the library is the apartment the
<PB N="151" REF="160">expences of which involve him in debt or di&s;grace. And for one literary &s;lattern who now manife&s;ts her indifference to her hu&s;band by the neglect of her per&s;on, there are &s;cores of elegant &s;pendthrifts who ruin theirs by exce&s;s of decoration.</P>
<P>May I digre&s;s a little while I remark, that I am far from a&s;&s;erting that literature has never filled women with vanity and &s;elf-conceit; but I will a&s;&s;ert, that in general tho&s;e whom books are &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;poiled, would have been &s;poiled in another way without them. She who is a vain pedant becau&s;e &s;he has read much, has probably that defect in her mind which would have made her a vain fool if &s;he had read nothing. It is not her hav|ing more knowledge but le&s;s &s;en&s;e, which makes her in&s;ufferable; and illiteracy would have added little to her value, for it is not what &s;he has, but what &s;he wants, which makes her unplea&s;ant. The&s;e in&s;tances too only furni&s;h a fre&s;h argument
<PB N="152" REF="161">for the general cultivation of the female mind. The wider diffu&s;ion of &s;ound knowledge would remove that temptation to be vain which may be excited by its rarity.</P>
<P>But while we would a&s;&s;ert that a woman of a cultivated intellect is not driven by the fame nece&s;&s;ity into the giddy whirl of public re&s;ort; who but regrets that real cultivation does not <HI>inevitably</HI> pre&s;erve her from it? No wonder that inanity of cha|racter, that vacuity of mind, that torpid ignorance, &s;hould plunge into di&s;&s;ipation as their natural refuge; &s;hould &s;eek to bury their in&s;ignificance in the crowd of pre&s;&s;ing multitudes, and hope to e&s;cape analy&s;is and detection in the undi&s;tingui&s;hed ma&s;&s;es of mixed a&s;&s;emblies! <HI>There</HI> attrition rubs all bodies &s;mooth, and makes all &s;urfaces alike; thither &s;uperficial and external ac|compli&s;hments naturally fly as to their proper &s;cene of action; as to a field where competition is in perpetual exerci&s;e; where
<PB N="153" REF="162">the laurels of admiration are to be won, and the trophies of vanity triumphantly carried off!</P>
<P>It would indeed be matter of little com|parative regret, if this corrupt air were only breathed by tho&s;e of the above de&s;cription who&s;e natural element it &s;eems to be; but who can forbear regretting that the power of fa&s;hion attracts al&s;o into this impure and unwhole&s;ome atmo&s;phere minds of a better make, of higher aims and ends, of more ethereal temper? Minds who, renouncing enjoyments for which they have a genuine ta&s;te, and which would make them really happy, neglect &s;ociety they love and pur&s;uits they admire, in order that they may <HI>&s;eem</HI> happy and <HI>be</HI> fa&s;hionable in the chace of plea&s;ures they de&s;pi&s;e, and in company they di&s;|approve! But no correctne&s;s of ta&s;te, no depth of knowledge, will infallibly pre&s;erve a woman from this contagion, unle&s;s her heart be impre&s;&s;ed with a deep Chri&s;tian conviction that &s;he is re&s;pon&s;ible for the
<PB N="154" REF="163">application of knowledge as well as for the dedication of time.</P>
<P>This contagion is &s;o deep, &s;o wide, and fatal, that if I were called upon to a&s;&s;ign the predominant cau&s;e of the greater part of the misfortunes and corruptions of the great and gay in our days, I &s;hould not look for it principally in any &s;eemingly great or &s;triking cau&s;e; not in the practice of notorious vices, not originally in the dereliction of Chri&s;tian principle; but I &s;hould not he&s;itate to a&s;cribe it to a growing, regular, &s;y&s;tematic &s;eries of amu&s;ements; to an ince&s;&s;ant, boundle&s;s, and not very di&s;reputable DISSIPATION. Other corruptions, though more formidable in appearance, are yet le&s;s fatal in &s;ome re&s;pects, becau&s;e they leave us intervals to reflect on their turpitude, and &s;pirit to lament their exce&s;&s;es: but di&s;&s;ipation is the more hopele&s;s, as by engro&s;&s;ing almo&s;t the whole of life, and enervating the whole moral and intellectual &s;y&s;tem, it leaves neither time for reflection, nor &s;pace for
<PB N="155" REF="164">&s;elf-examination, nor temper for the che|ri&s;hing of right affections, nor lei&s;ure for the operation of &s;ound principles, nor in|terval for regret, nor vigour to re&s;i&s;t temptation, nor energy to &s;truggle for amendment.</P>
<P>The great ma&s;ter of the &s;cience of plea|&s;ure among the ancients, who reduced it into a &s;y&s;tem, which he called <HI>the chief good of man,</HI> directed that there &s;hould be interval enough between the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of delights to &s;harpen inclination; and ac|cordingly in&s;tituted periodical days of ab|&s;tinence: well-knowing that gratification was be&s;t promoted by previous &s;elf-denial. But &s;o little do our votaries of fa&s;hion under&s;tand the true nature of plea&s;ure, that one amu&s;ement is allowed to overtake another without any interval, either for recollection of the pa&s;t, or preparation for the future. Even on their own &s;elfi&s;h principle, therefore, nothing can be wor&s;e under&s;tood than this unremitted pur&s;uit of enjoyment: for to &s;uch a degree of
<PB N="156" REF="165">labour is this pur&s;uit carried, that their plea&s;ures exhau&s;t in&s;tead of exhilarating; and their recreations require to be re&s;ted from.</P>
<P>And, not to argue the que&s;tion on the ground of religion, but merely on that of pre&s;ent enjoyment; look abroad and &s;ee who are the people that complain of wearine&s;s, li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, and dejection? You will not find them among &s;uch as are overdone with work, but with plea&s;ure. The natural and healthful fatigues of bu&s;i|ne&s;s are recruited with natural and cheap gratifications; but a &s;pirit worn down with the toils of amu&s;ement, requires plea|&s;ures of poignancy; varied, multiplied, &s;timulating!</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved by medical writers, that that &s;ober exce&s;s in which many in|dulge, by con&s;tantly eating and drinking a little too much at every day's dinner and every night's &s;upper, more effectually undermines the health, than tho&s;e acci|dental exce&s;&s;es with which others now and
<PB N="157" REF="166">then break in upon a life of general &s;obriety. This illu&s;tration is not intro|duced with a de&s;ign to recommend occa|&s;ional deviations into gro&s;s vice, by way of a pious receipt for mending the morals; but merely to &s;ugge&s;t that there is more probability that tho&s;e who are &s;ometimes driven by unre&s;i&s;ted pa&s;&s;ion into irregu|larities which &s;hock their cooler rea&s;on, are more liable to be rou&s;ed to a &s;en&s;e of their danger, than per&s;ons who&s;e per|ceptions of evil are blunted by a round of &s;y&s;tematical, exce&s;&s;ive, and yet not &s;candal|ous di&s;&s;ipation. And when I affirm that this &s;y&s;tem of regular indulgence relaxes the &s;oul, en&s;laves the heart, bewitches the &s;en&s;es, and thus di&s;qualifies for pious thought or u&s;eful action, without having any thing in it &s;o gro&s;s as to &s;hock the con&s;cience; and when I hazard an opinion that this &s;tate is more formidable becau&s;e le&s;s alarming than that which bears upon it a more determined character of evil, I no more mean to &s;peak of the latter in
<PB N="158" REF="167">&s;light and palliating terms, than I would intimate that becau&s;e the &s;ick &s;ometimes recover from a fever, but &s;eldom from a pal&s;y, that a fever is therefore a &s;afe or a healthy &s;tate.</P>
<P>But there &s;eems to be an error in the fir&s;t concoction, out of which the &s;ub&s;equent errors &s;ucce&s;&s;ively grow. Fir&s;t then, as has been ob&s;erved before, the &s;howy education of women tends chiefly to qualify them for the glare of public a&s;&s;emblies: &s;econdly, they &s;eem in many in&s;tances to be &s;o educated, with a view to the greater probability of their being &s;plendidly married: thirdly, it is alleged in vindication of tho&s;e di&s;&s;ipated practices, that daughters can only be &s;een, and ad|mirers procured at balls, operas, and a&s;&s;emblies; and that therefore, by a natural con&s;equence, balls, operas, and a&s;&s;emblies mu&s;t be followed up without intermi&s;&s;ion till the object be effected. For the accom|pli&s;hment of this object it is that all this complicated machinery had been pre|viou&s;ly
<PB N="159" REF="168">viou&s;ly &s;et a going, and kept in motion with an activity not at all &s;lackened by the di&s;ordered &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem; for &s;ome machines, in&s;tead of being &s;topped, go fa&s;ter becau&s;e the true &s;pring is out of order; the only difference being that they go wrong, and &s;o the increa&s;ed rapidity only adds to the quantity of error.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o, as we have already remarked, an error to fancy that the love of plea&s;ure exhau&s;ts it&s;elf by indulgence, and that the very young are chiefly addicted to it. The contrary appears to be true. The de&s;ire grows with the pur&s;uit upon the &s;ame principle as motion is quickened by the continuance of the impetus.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, it cannot be thought unfair to trace back the exce&s;&s;ive fondne&s;s for amu&s;ement to that mode of education we have el&s;ewhere reprobated. Few of the accompli&s;hments, fal&s;ely &s;o called, a&s;&s;i&s;t the development of the faculties: they do not exerci&s;e the judgment, nor bring into action tho&s;e powers which fit the
<PB N="160" REF="169">heart and mind for the occupations of life: they do not prepare women to love home, to under&s;tand its occupations, to enliven its uniformity, to fulfil its duties, to multiply its comforts: they do not lead to that &s;ort of experimental logic, if I may &s;o &s;peak, compounded of ob&s;ervation and reflection, which makes up the moral &s;cience of life and manners. Talents which have <HI>di&s;play</HI> for their object de&s;pi&s;e the narrow &s;tage of home: they demand mankind for their &s;pectators, and the world for their theatre.</P>
<P>While one cannot help &s;hrinking a little from the idea of a delicate young creature, lovely in per&s;on, and engaging in mind and manners, &s;acrificing nightly at the public &s;hrine of Fa&s;hion, at once the votary and the victim; one cannot help figuring to one&s;elf how much more intere&s;ting &s;he would appear in the eyes of a man of feeling, did he behold her in the more endearing &s;ituations of dome&s;tic life. And who can forbear wi&s;hing, that the good
<PB N="161" REF="170">&s;en&s;e, good ta&s;te, and delicacy of the men had rather led them to prefer &s;eeking companions for life in the almo&s;t &s;acred quiet of a virtuous home? <HI>There</HI> they might have had the means of &s;eeing and admiring tho&s;e amiable beings in the be&s;t point of view: <HI>there</HI> they might have been enabled to form a ju&s;ter e&s;timate of female worth, than is likely to be obtained in &s;cenes where &s;uch qualities and talents as might be expected to add to the &s;tock of dome&s;tic comfort mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be kept in the back ground, and where &s;uch only <HI>can</HI> be brought into view as are not par|ticularly calculated to in&s;ure the certainty of home delights.</P>
<Q><L>O! did they keep their per&s;ons fre&s;h and new,</L>
<L>How would they pluck allegiance from men's hearts,</L>
<L>And win by rarene&s;s.</L></Q>
<P>But by what unaccountable infatuation is it that men too, even men of &s;en&s;e, join in the confederacy again&s;t their own happine&s;s by looking for their home com|panions in the re&s;orts of vanity? Why do
<PB N="162" REF="171">not &s;uch men ri&s;e &s;uperior to the illu&s;ions of fa&s;hions? why do they not uniformly &s;eek her who is to pre&s;ide in <HI>their</HI> families in the bo&s;om of her own? in the practice of every dome&s;tic duty, in the exerci&s;e of every amiable virtue, in the exertion of every elegant accompli&s;hment? tho&s;e ac|compli&s;hments of which we have been reprobating, not the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, but the application? <HI>there</HI> they would find her exerting them to their true end, to enliven bu&s;ine&s;s, to animate retirement, to embel|li&s;h the charming &s;cene of family delights, to heighten the intere&s;ting plea&s;ures of &s;ocial intercour&s;e, and, ri&s;ing to their noble&s;t object, to adorn the doctrine of God her Saviour.</P>
<P>If, indeed, woman were mere out&s;ide form and face only, and if <HI>mind</HI> made up no part of her compo&s;ition, it would fol|low that a ball-room was quite as appro|priate a place for choo&s;ing a wife, as an exhibition room for choo&s;ing a picture. But, ina&s;much as women are not mere
<PB N="163" REF="172">portraits, their value not being determin|able by a glance of the eye, it follows that a different mode of appreciating their value, and a different place for viewing them antecedent to their being individu|ally &s;elected, is de&s;irable. The two ca&s;es differ al&s;o in this, that if a man &s;elect a picture for him&s;elf from among all its ex|hibited competitors, and bring it to his own hou&s;e, the picture being pa&s;&s;ive, he is able to <HI>fix</HI> it there: while the wife, picked up at a public place, and accu&s;|tomed to ince&s;&s;ant di&s;play, will not, it is probable, when brought home &s;tick &s;o quietly to the &s;pot where he fixes her; but will e&s;cape to the exhibition room again, and continue to be di&s;played at every &s;ub&s;equent exhibition, ju&s;t as if &s;he were not become private property, and had never been definitively di&s;po&s;ed of.</P>
<P>It is the novelty of a thing which a&s;to|ni&s;hes us, and not its ab&s;urdity: objects may be &s;o long kept before the eye that it begins no longer to ob&s;erve them; or
<PB N="164" REF="173">may be brought into &s;uch clo&s;e contact with it, that it does not di&s;cern them. Long habit &s;o reconciles us to almo&s;t any thing, that the gro&s;&s;e&s;t improprieties cea&s;e to &s;trike us when they are once melted into the common cour&s;e of action. This, by the way, is a &s;trong rea&s;on for car|fully &s;ifting every opinion and every practice before we let them incorporate into the ma&s;s of our habits, after which they will be no more examined.&mdash;Would it not be accounted prepo&s;terous for a young man to &s;ay he had fancied &s;uch a lady would dance a better minuet, becau&s;e he had &s;een her behave devoutly at Church, and <HI>therefore</HI> had cho&s;en her for his partner? and yet he is not thought at all ab&s;urd when he intimates that he cho&s;e a partner for life becau&s;e he was plea&s;ed with her at a ball. Surely the place of choo&s;ing and the motive of choice, would be ju&s;t as appropriate in one ca&s;e as in the other, and the mi&s;take, if the judgment failed, not <HI>quite</HI> &s;o &s;erious.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="174">There is, among the more elevated cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety, a certain &s;et of per&s;ons who are plea&s;ed exclu&s;ively to call them|&s;elves, and whom others by a &s;ort of com|pelled courte&s;y are plea&s;ed to call, <HI>the fine world.</HI> This &s;mall detachment con|&s;ider their &s;ituation with re&s;pect to the re&s;t of mankind, ju&s;t as the ancient Gre|cians did theirs; that is, the Grecians thought there were but two &s;orts of beings, and that all who were not Gre|cians were barbarians; &s;o this <HI>certain &s;et</HI> con&s;iders &s;ociety as re&s;olving it&s;elf into two di&s;tinct cla&s;&s;es, the <HI>fine world</HI> and the <HI>people;</HI> to which la&s;t cla&s;s they turn over all who do not belong to their little <HI>co|terie,</HI> however high their rank or fortune.

<P>In this &s;ociety a young man lo&s;es his natural character, which, whatever it might originally have been, is melted down and ca&s;t into the one prevailing mould of Fa&s;hion; all the &s;trong, native, di&s;criminating qualities of his mind being made to take one &s;hape, one &s;tamp, one &s;uper&s;cription! However varied and di&s;|tinct might have been the materials which nature threw into the crucible, pla&s;tic Fa&s;hion takes care that they &s;hall all be the &s;ame, or at lea&s;t appear the &s;ame, when they come out of the mould. A young man in &s;uch an artificial &s;tate of &s;ociety, accu&s;tomed to the voluptuous ea&s;e, refined luxuries, &s;oft accommodations, ob|&s;equious attendance, and all the unre|&s;trained indulgencies of a fa&s;hionable club,
<PB N="167" REF="176">is not likely after marriage to take very cordially to a home, unle&s;s very extraor|dinary exertions are made to amu&s;e, to attach, and to intere&s;t him: and he is not likely to lend a very helping hand to the happine&s;s of the union, who&s;e mo&s;t laborious exertions have hitherto been little more than a &s;elfi&s;h &s;tratagem to re|concile health with plea&s;ure. Exce&s;s of gratification has only &s;erved to make him irritable and exacting; it will of cour&s;e be no part of his project to make &s;acrifices, but to receive them: and what would appear incredible to the <HI>Paladins</HI> of gallant times, and the <HI>Chevaliers Preux</HI> of more heroic days, even in the nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s of e&s;tabli&s;hing him&s;elf for life, he &s;ome|times is more di&s;po&s;ed to expect attentions than to make advances.</P>
<P>Thus the indolent &s;on of fa&s;hion, with a thou&s;and fine, but dormant qualities, which a bad tone of manners forbids him to bring into exerci&s;e; with real energies which that tone does not allow him to
<PB N="168" REF="177">di&s;cover, and an unreal apathy which it commands him to feign; with the heart of an hero, perhaps, if called into the field, he affects the manners of a Sybarite; and he, who with a Roman, or what is more, with a Briti&s;h valour, would leap into the gulph at the call of public duty, Yet in the &s;oft and piping time of peace, when fa&s;hion had re&s;umed her rights, he would murmur if a ro&s;e leaf lay double under him.</P>
<P>The clubs above alluded to, as has been &s;aid, generate and cheri&s;h luxurious habits, from their perfect ea&s;e, undre&s;s, liberty, and equality of di&s;tinction in rank: they promote a &s;pirit for play, and in &s;hort, every temper and &s;pirit which tends to undome&s;ticate; and what adds to the mi&s;chief is, all this is attained at a cheap rate compared with home in the &s;ame &s;tyle.</P>
<P>The&s;e indulgencies, and that habit of mind, gratify &s;o many pa&s;&s;ions, that it can never be counteracted &s;ucce&s;sfully by any
<PB N="169" REF="178">thing of <HI>its own kind,</HI> or which gratifies the <HI>&s;ame</HI> habits. Now, a pa&s;&s;ion for gratify|ing vanity, and a &s;pirit of di&s;&s;ipation, <HI>is</HI> a pa&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame kind; and therefore, though for a few weeks, a man who has cho&s;en his wife in the haunts of di&s;&s;ipation, and this wife, a woman made up of accom|pli&s;hments, may, from the novelty of the connexion and of the &s;cene, continue dome&s;|tic; yet in a little time &s;he will find that tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, to which &s;he has tru&s;ted for making his married life plea&s;ant, will long for the more comfortable plea&s;ures of the club; and <HI>&s;he</HI> will, while they are pur&s;ued, be con&s;igned over to &s;olitary evenings at home, or driven back to the old di&s;&s;i|pations.</P>
<P>To conquer the pa&s;&s;ion for club gratifi|cations, a woman mu&s;t not &s;trive to feed it with &s;ufficient aliment in the &s;ame kind in her &s;ociety, either at home or abroad; for this &s;he cannot do: but &s;he mu&s;t &s;upplant and overcome it by a pa&s;&s;ion of a different nature, which Providence has kindly
<PB N="170" REF="179">planted within us, the love of fire-&s;ide en|joyments. But to qualify her&s;elf for ad|mini&s;tering the&s;e, &s;he mu&s;t cultivate her under&s;tanding and her heart; acquiring at the &s;ame time that modicum of accom|pli&s;hments &s;uited to his ta&s;te, which may qualify her for po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, both for him and for her&s;elf, greater varieties of &s;afe recreation.</P>
<P>One great cau&s;e of the want of attach|ment in the&s;e modi&s;h couples is, that by living in the world at large, they are not driven to depend on each other as the chief &s;ource of comfort. Now it is pretty clear, in &s;pite of modern theories, that the very frame and being of &s;ocieties, whether great or &s;mall, public or private, is jointed and glued together by dependence. Tho&s;e attachments which ari&s;e from, and are compacted by, a &s;en&s;e of mutual wants, mutual affection, mutual benefit, and mu|tual obligation, are the cement which &s;ecure the union of the family as well as of the &s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="180">Unfortunately, when two young per&s;ons of the above de&s;cription marry, the union is &s;ometimes con&s;idered rather as the end than the beginning of an engagement: the attachment of each to the other is rather viewed as an object already completed, than as one which marriage is to confirm more clo&s;ely. But the companion for life is not always cho&s;en from the pure&s;t motive; &s;he is &s;elected, perhaps, becau&s;e &s;he is admired by other men, rather than becau&s;e &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in an eminent degree tho&s;e peculiar qualities which are likely to con&s;titute the individual happine&s;s of the man who choo&s;es her. Vanity u&s;urps the place of affection; and indolence &s;wallows up the judgment. Not happine&s;s, but &s;ome ea&s;y &s;ub&s;titute for happine&s;s is pur|&s;ued; and a choice which may excite envy, rather than produce &s;atisfaction, is adopted as the means of effecting it.</P>
<P>The pair, not <HI>matched, but joined,</HI> &s;et out &s;eparately with their independent and individual pur&s;uits; whether it made a
<PB N="172" REF="181">part of their original plan or not, that they &s;hould be indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to each other's comfort, the &s;en&s;e of this nece&s;&s;ity, probably not very &s;trong at fir&s;t, rather dimini&s;hes than increa&s;es by time; they live &s;o much in the world, and &s;o little together, that to &s;tand well with their <HI>own &s;et</HI> continues the favourite project of each; while to &s;tand well with each other is con|&s;idered as an under part of the plot in the drama of life: whereas, did they &s;tart in the conjugal race with the fixed idea that they were to look to each other for the principal happine&s;s of life, not only prin|ciple, but prudence, and even &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s would convince them of the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;edulou&s;ly cultivating each other's e&s;teem and affection as the grand &s;pring of pro|moting that happine&s;s. But vanity, and the de&s;ire of flattery and applau&s;e, &s;till continue to operate. Even after the hu&s;|band is brought to feel a perfect indiffer|ence for his wife, he &s;till likes to &s;ee her decorated in a &s;tyle which may &s;erve to
<PB N="173" REF="182">ju&s;tify his choice. He encourages her to &s;et off her per&s;on, not &s;o much for his own gratification, as that his &s;elf-love may be flattered, by her continuing to attract the admiration of tho&s;e who&s;e opinion is the &s;tandard by which he mea&s;ures his fame, and which fame is to &s;tand him in the &s;tead of happine&s;s. Thus is &s;he nece&s;&s;arily expo&s;ed to the two-fold tempt|ation of being at once neglected by her hu&s;band, and exhibited as an object of attraction to other men. If &s;he e&s;cape this complicated danger, &s;he will be in|debted for her pre&s;ervation not to his prudence, but to her own principles.</P>
<P>In &s;ome of the&s;e modi&s;h marriages, in&s;tead of the decorous neatne&s;s, the plea|&s;ant intercour&s;e, and the mutual warmth of communication of the once &s;ocial dinner; the late and unintere&s;ting meal is com|monly hurried over by the languid and &s;lovenly pair, that the one may have time to dre&s;s for his club, and the other for her party. And in the&s;e cold ab&s;tracted
<PB N="174" REF="183"><HI>t&ecirc;tes-&agrave;-t&ecirc;tes,</HI> they often take as little pains to entertain each other, as if the one was preci&s;ely the only human being in the world in who&s;e eyes the other did not feel it nece&s;&s;ary to appear agreeable.</P>
<P>But if the&s;e young and perhaps really amiable per&s;ons could &s;truggle again&s;t the imperious tyranny of fa&s;hion, and contrive to pa&s;s a little time together, &s;o as to get acquainted with each other; and if each would live in the lively and con&s;cientious exerci&s;e of tho&s;e talents and attractions which they &s;ometimes know how to pro|duce on occa&s;ions not <HI>quite</HI> &s;o ju&s;tifiable; they would, I am per&s;uaded, often find out each other to be very agreeable people. And both of them, delighted and delight|ing, would no longer be driven to the anxious nece&s;&s;ity of perpetually flying from home as from the only &s;cene which offers no po&s;&s;ible materials for plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>It may &s;eem a contradiction to have a&s;&s;erted that beings of all ages, tempers, and talents, &s;hould with &s;uch unremitting
<PB N="175" REF="184">indu&s;try follow up any way of life if they did not find &s;ome enjoyment in it; yet I appeal to the bo&s;oms of the&s;e ince&s;&s;ant hunters in the chace of plea&s;ure, whether they are really happy. No.&mdash;In the full tide and torrent of diver&s;ion, in the full blaze of gaiety, The heart di&s;tru&s;ting a&s;ks if this be joy? But there is an anxious re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s which, if not intere&s;ting, is bu&s;tling. There is the dread and partly the di&s;credit of being &s;u&s;pected of having one hour unmortgaged, not only to &s;ucce&s;&s;ive, but contending engagements; this it is, and not the plea|&s;ure of the engagement it&s;elf, which is the object. There is an agitation in the arrangements which impo&s;es it&s;elf on the vacant heart for happine&s;s. There is a tumult kept up in the &s;pirits which is a bu&s;y though treacherous &s;ub&s;titute for comfort. The multiplicity of &s;olicitations &s;oothes vanity. The very regret that they
<PB N="176" REF="185">cannot be all accepted has its charms; for dignity is flattered becau&s;e refu&s;al implies importance. Then there is the joy of being invited when others are neglected; the triumph of &s;howing one's le&s;s modi&s;h friend that one is going where &s;he cannot come; and the feigned regret at being <HI>obliged</HI> to go, a&s;&s;umed before her who is half wild at being obliged to &s;tay away. The&s;e are &s;ome of the &s;upplemental &s;hifts for happine&s;s with which vanity contrives to feed her hungry followers.</P>
<P>In the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of open hou&s;es in which Plea&s;ure is to be &s;tarted and pur&s;ued on any given night, the exi&s;ting place is never taken into the account of enjoy|ment: the &s;cene of which is always &s;up|po&s;ed to lie in any place where her votaries happen not to be. Plea&s;ure has no pre&s;ent ten&s;e: but in the hou&s;e which her pur|&s;uers have ju&s;t quitted, and in the hou&s;e to which they are ju&s;t ha&s;tening, a &s;tranger might conclude the &s;lippery godde&s;s had

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. <HI>On public amu&s;ements.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is not propo&s;ed to enter the long conte&s;ted field of controver&s;y as to the individual amu&s;ements which may be con|&s;idered as &s;afe and lawful for tho&s;e women of the higher cla&s;s who make a &s;trict pro|fe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity. The judgment they will be likely to form for them&s;elves on this &s;ubject, and the plan they will con|&s;equently adopt, will depend much on the clearne&s;s or ob&s;curity in their religious views, and on the greater or le&s;s progre&s;s they have made in their Chri&s;tian cour&s;e. It is in their choice of amu&s;ements that you get in &s;ome mea&s;ure to know the real di&s;po&s;itions of mankind. In their <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> in the leading employments of life, their path is in a good degree chalked out
<PB N="182" REF="191">for them: there is in this re&s;pect a &s;ort of general character wherein the greater part, more or le&s;s, mu&s;t coincide. But in their plea&s;ures the choice is voluntary, the ta&s;te is &s;elf-directed, the propen&s;ity is inde|pendent; and of cour&s;e the habitual &s;tate, the genuine bent and bias of the temper, are mo&s;t likely to be &s;een in tho&s;e pur&s;uits which every man is at liberty to choo&s;e for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>When a truly religious principle &s;hall have acquired &s;uch a degree of force as to produce that con&s;cientious and habitual improvement of time before re|commended, it will di&s;cover it&s;elf by an increa&s;ing indifference and even deadne&s;s to tho&s;e plea&s;ures which are intere&s;ting to the world at large. A woman under the predominating influence of &s;uch a principle, will begin to di&s;cover that the &s;ame thing which in it&s;elf is innocent may yet be comparatively wrong. She will begin to feel that there are many amu&s;e|ments and employments which though
<PB N="183" REF="192">they have nothing cen&s;urable in them|&s;elves, yet if they be allowed to intrench on hours which ought to be dedicated to &s;till better purpo&s;es; or if they are protracted to an undue length; or above all, if by &s;oftening and relaxing her mind and di&s;&s;ipating her &s;pirits, they &s;o indi&s;po&s;e her for better pur&s;uits as to render &s;ub&s;equent duties a burden, they are in that ca&s;e clearly wrong for her, whatever they may be for others. Now as temptations of this &s;ort are the peculiar dangers of better kind of characters, the &s;acrifice of &s;uch little gratifications as may <HI>have no great harm in them,</HI> come in among the daily calls to &s;elf-denial in a Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>The fine arts, for in&s;tance, polite litera|ture, elegant &s;ociety, the&s;e are among the lawful, and liberal, and becoming recreations of higher life; yet if even the&s;e be cultivated to the neglect or exclu&s;ion of &s;everer duties; if they in|terfere with &s;erious &s;tudies, or di&s;qualify the mind for religious exerci&s;es, it is an intima|tion
<PB N="184" REF="193">that they have been too much in|dulged; and, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, it might be the part of Chri&s;tian circum|&s;pection to inquire if the time devoted to them ought not to be abridged. Above all, a tender con&s;cience will never lo&s;e fight of one &s;afe rule of determining in all doubtful ca&s;es: if the point be &s;o nice that though we hope upon the whole there <HI>may</HI> be no harm in engaging in it, we may at lea&s;t be always quite &s;ure that there <HI>can</HI> be no harm in letting it alone.</P>
<P>The principle of being re&s;pon&s;ible for the u&s;e of time once fixed in the mind, the con&s;cientious Chri&s;tian will be making a continual progre&s;s in the great art of turning time to account. In the fir&s;t &s;tages of her religion &s;he will have ab&s;tained from plea&s;ures which began a <HI>little</HI> to wound the con&s;cience, or which a&s;&s;umed a que&s;|tionable &s;hape; but &s;he will probably have ab&s;tained with regret, and with a &s;ecret wi&s;h that con&s;cience <HI>could</HI> have permitted
<PB N="185" REF="194">her to keep well with plea&s;ure and religion too. But you may di&s;cern in her &s;ub|&s;equent cour&s;e that &s;he has reached a more advanced &s;tage, by her beginning to neglect even &s;uch plea&s;ures or employ|ments as have no moral turpitude in them, but are merely what are called innocent. This relinqui&s;hment ari&s;es, not &s;o much from her feeling &s;till more the re&s;traints of religion, as from the im|provement in her religious ta&s;te. Plea&s;ures cannot now attach her merely from their being innocent, unle&s;s they are intere&s;ting al&s;o, and to be intere&s;ting they mu&s;t be con&s;onant to her &s;uperinduced views. She is not contented to &s;pend a large portion of her time harmle&s;sly, it mu&s;t be &s;pent profitably al&s;o. Nay, if &s;he be indeed earne&s;tly <Q>pre&s;&s;ing towards the mark,</Q> it will not be even enough for her that her pre&s;ent pur&s;uit be good if &s;he be convinced that it might be &s;till better. Her contempt of ordinary en|joyments will increa&s;e in a direct propor|tion
<PB N="186" REF="195">to her increa&s;ed reli&s;h for tho&s;e plea|&s;ures which religion enjoins and be&s;tows. So that at length if it were po&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e that an angel could come down to take off as it were the interdict, and to invite her to re&s;ume all the plea&s;ures &s;he had renounced, and to re&s;ume them with complete impunity, &s;he would reject the invitation, becau&s;e &s;he would de&s;pi&s;e, from an improvement in her &s;piritual ta&s;te, tho&s;e delights from which &s;he had at fir&s;t ab&s;tained through fear. Till her will and affections come heartily to be engaged in the &s;ervice of God, the progre&s;s will not be comfortable; but when once they are &s;o engaged, the attachment to this &s;ervice will be cordial, and her heart will not de&s;ire to go back and toil again in the drudgery of the world. For her religion has not &s;o much given her a new creed, as a new heart, and a new life.</P>
<P>As her views are become new, &s;o her tempers, di&s;po&s;itions, ta&s;tes, actions, pur&s;uits, choice of company, choice of
<PB N="187" REF="196">amu&s;ements, are new al&s;o; her employ|ment of time is changed; her turn of conver&s;ation is altered; <Q>old things are pa&s;&s;ed away, all things are become new.</Q> In di&s;&s;ipated and worldly &s;o|ciety, &s;he will &s;eldom fail to feel a &s;ort of unea&s;ine&s;s, which will produce one of the&s;e two effects; &s;he will either, as proper &s;ea&s;ons pre&s;ent them&s;elves, &s;truggle hard to introduce &s;uch &s;ubjects as may be u&s;eful to others; or, &s;uppo&s;ing that &s;he finds her|&s;elf unable to effect this, &s;he will, as far as &s;he prudently can, ab&s;ent her&s;elf from that unprofitable kind of &s;ociety. Indeed her manner of conducting her&s;elf under the&s;e circum&s;tances may &s;erve to furni&s;h her with a te&s;t of her own &s;incerity. For while people are contending for a little more of this amu&s;ement, and pleading for a little exten&s;ion of that gratification, and fighting to hedge in a little more territory to their plea&s;ure-ground, they are exhibit|ing a kind of evidence again&s;t them&s;elves,
<PB N="188" REF="197">that they are not yet <Q>renewed in the &s;pirit of their mind.</Q></P>
<P>It has been warmly urged as an objec|tion to certain religious books, and par|ticularly again&s;t a recent work of high worth and celebrity, by a di&s;tingui&s;hed layman <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Practical View, &amp;c. by Mr. Wilberforce.</NOTE>, that they have &s;et the &s;tandard of &s;elf-denial higher than rea&s;on or even than Chri&s;tianity requires. The&s;e works do indeed elevate the general tone of reli|gion to a higher pitch than is quite con|venient to tho&s;e who are at infinite pains to con&s;truct a comfortable and compre|hen&s;ive plan, which &s;hall unite the que&s;|tionable plea&s;ures of this world with the promi&s;ed happine&s;s of the next. I &s;ay it has been &s;ometimes objected, even by tho&s;e readers who on the whole greatly admire the particular work in que&s;tion, that it is unrea&s;onably &s;trict in the precep|tive and prohibitory parts; and e&s;pecially that it individually and &s;pecifically forbids
<PB N="189" REF="198">certain fa&s;hionable amu&s;ements, with a &s;everity not to be found in the &s;criptures; and is &s;crupulou&s;ly rigid in condemning diver&s;ions again&s;t which nothing is &s;aid in the New Te&s;tament: each objector, how|ever, is &s;o far rea&s;onable, as only to beg quarter for her own favorite amu&s;ement, and generou&s;ly abandons the defence of tho&s;e in which &s;he her&s;elf has no plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>But the&s;e objectors do not &s;eem to under&s;tand the true genius of Chri&s;tianity. They do not con&s;ider that it is the charac|ter of the Go&s;pel to exhibit a &s;cheme of principles, of which it is the tendency to infu&s;e &s;uch a &s;pirit of holine&s;s as mu&s;t be utterly incompatible, not only with cu&s;toms decidedly vicious, but with the very &s;pirit of worldly plea&s;ure. They do not con&s;ider that Chri&s;tianity is neither a table of ethics, nor a &s;y&s;tem of opinions, nor a bundle of rods to puni&s;h, nor an exhibition of rewards to allure, nor a &s;cheme of re&s;traints, nor merely a code of laws; but it is a new principle infu&s;ed
<PB N="190" REF="199">into the heart, by the word and the &s;pirit of God, out of which principle will inevit|ably grow right opinions, renewed affec|tions, correct morals, and holy habits, with an invariable de&s;ire of plea&s;ing God, and a con&s;tant fear of offending him. A real Chri&s;tian, who&s;e heart is once tho|roughly imbued with this principle, can no more return to the amu&s;ements of the world, than a philo&s;opher can be refre&s;hed with the amu&s;ed with the recreations of a child. The New Te&s;tament is not a mere &s;tatute-book: it is not a table where every offence is detailed, and its corre&s;|ponding penalty annexed: it is not &s;o much a <HI>compilation,</HI> as a <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of laws: it does not &s;o much prohibit every individual wrong practice, as &s;ugge&s;t a temper and general principle with which every wrong practice is incompatible. It did not, for in&s;tance, &s;o much attack the then-reigning and corrupt fa&s;hions, which were probably, like the fa&s;hions of other countries, tem|porary
<PB N="191" REF="200">porary and local; but it &s;truck at that worldline&s;s which is the root and &s;tock from which all corrupt fa&s;hions proceed.</P>
<P>The prophet I&s;aiah, who addre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf more particularly to the I&s;raeliti&s;h women, inveighed not only again&s;t vanity, luxury, and immode&s;ty, in general; but with great propriety inveighed again&s;t tho&s;e preci&s;e in&s;tances of each, to which the women of rank in the particular coun|try he was addre&s;&s;ing were e&s;pecially ad|dicted; nay, he enters into the minute detail <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah, chap. iii.</NOTE> of their very per&s;onal decorations, and brings &s;pecific charges again&s;t their levity and extravagance of apparel; mean|ing, indeed, chiefly to cen&s;ure the turn of character which the&s;e indicated. But the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, which was to be addre&s;&s;ed to all ages, &s;tations, and countries, &s;eldom contains any &s;uch detailed animadver&s;ions; for though many of the cen&s;urable modes which the prophet &s;o &s;everely reprobated
<PB N="192" REF="201">continued probably to be &s;till prevalent in Jeru&s;alem in the days of our Saviour, yet how little would it have &s;uited the univer&s;ality of his mi&s;&s;ion, to have con|fined his preaching to &s;uch local, limited, and fluctuating cu&s;toms! not but that there are many texts which actually <HI>do</HI> define the Chri&s;tian conduct as well as temper, with &s;ufficient particularity to &s;erve as condemnation of many prac|tices which are pleaded for, and often point pretty directly at them.</P>
<P>Had Peter on that memorable day, when he added three thou&s;and converts to the Church by a &s;ingle &s;ermon, nar|rowed his &s;ubject to a remon&s;trance again&s;t this diver&s;ion, or that public place, or the other vain amu&s;ement, it might indeed have &s;uited the ca&s;e of &s;ome of the female Jewi&s;h converts who were pre&s;ent; but &s;uch re&s;trictions as might have been appro|priate to them would probably not have applied to the ca&s;es of the Parthians and Medes, of which his audience was partly
<PB N="193" REF="202">compo&s;ed; or &s;uch as might have belonged to them would have been totally inappli|cable to the Cretes and Arabians; or again, tho&s;e which &s;uited them would not have applied to the Elamites and Me&s;opota|mians. By &s;uch partial and circum&s;cribed addre&s;&s;es, his multifarious audience, com|po&s;ed of all nations and countries, would not have been, as we are told they were, "pricked to the heart." But when he preached on the broad ground of general <Q>repentance and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</Q> it was no won|der that they all cried out <Q>What &s;hall we do?</Q> The&s;e collected foreigners, at their return home, would have found very different u&s;ages to correct in their different countries; of cour&s;e a detailed re&s;triction of the popular abu&s;es at Jeru&s;alem would have been of little u&s;e to &s;trangers return|ing to their re&s;pective nations. The ardent apo&s;tle, therefore, acted more con&s;i&s;tently in communicating to them the large and comprehen&s;ive &s;pirit of the Go&s;pel, which
<PB N="194" REF="203">&s;hould at once involve all their &s;cattered and &s;eparate duties, and reprove all their &s;cattered and &s;eparate corruptions; for the whole always includes a part, and the greater involves the le&s;s. Chri&s;t and his Di&s;ciples, in&s;tead of limiting their condemn|ation to the peculiar vanities reprehended by I&s;aiah, embraced the very &s;oul and principle of them all, in &s;uch exhortations as the following: <Q>Be ye not conformed to the world:</Q>&mdash; <Q>If any man love the world the love of the Father is not in him:</Q>&mdash; <Q>The fa&s;hion of this world pa&s;&s;eth away.</Q> Our Lord and his Apo&s;tles, who&s;e future unlimited audience was to be made up out of the whole world, attacked the evil <HI>heart,</HI> out of which all tho&s;e incidental, local, and popular cor|ruptions proceeded.</P>
<P>In the time of Chri&s;t and his immediate followers, the luxury and intemperance of the Romans had ari&s;en to a pitch un|known before in the world; but as the &s;ame Go&s;pel was to be preached hereafter
<PB N="195" REF="204">before the Roman emperors them&s;elves, which its Divine Author and his di&s;ciples were then preaching to the hungry and nece&s;&s;itous; the large precept, <Q>Whether ye eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God,</Q> was likely to be of more general u&s;e, than any &s;eperate exhortation to temperance, to thankful|ne&s;s, to moderation as to quantity or ex|pence; which la&s;t indeed mu&s;t always be left in &s;ome degree to the judgment and the circum&s;tances of the individual.</P>
<P>When the Apo&s;tle of the Gentiles vi&s;ited the "Saints of Cae&s;ar's hou&s;ehold," he could not have heard without abhor|rence of &s;ome of the fa&s;hionable amu&s;e|ments in the court of Nero. He mu&s;t have reflected with peculiar indignation on many things which were practi&s;ed in the Circen&s;ian games: yet, in&s;tead of prun|ing this corrupt tree and &s;ingling out the inhuman gladiatorial &s;ports for the object of his condemnation, he laid his axe to the root of all &s;in, by preaching to them
<PB N="196" REF="205">that Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t of which <Q>he was not a&s;hamed;</Q> and &s;hewing them that believed, that <Q>it was the power of God and the wi&s;dom of God.</Q> Though it is &s;omewhat remarkable, that about the very time of his preaching to the Romans, the public ta&s;te had &s;unk to &s;uch an exce&s;s of depravity that the very women engaged in tho&s;e &s;hocking encounters with the gla|diators.</P>
<P>But in the fir&s;t place, it was better that their right practice &s;hould grow out of the right principle; and next his &s;pecifically reprobating the&s;e diver&s;ions would have had this ill effect, that &s;ucceeding ages, &s;eeing that they in their amu&s;ements came &s;omewhat &s;hort of tho&s;e dreadful exce&s;&s;es of the poli&s;hed Romans, would only have plumed them&s;elves on their own compara|tive &s;uperiority; and thus, on this prin|ciple, even the bull-fights of Madrid might have had their panegyri&s;ts. But the truth is, the apo&s;tle knew that &s;uch abominable corruptions could never &s;ub&s;i&s;t
<PB N="197" REF="206">together with Chri&s;tianity, and in effect the honour of aboli&s;hing the&s;e barbarous diver&s;ions was re&s;erved for Con&s;tantine the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian emperor.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the apo&s;tles, by inveighing again&s;t &s;ome <HI>particular</HI> diver&s;ions, would have &s;eemed to &s;anction all which they did not actually cen&s;ure: and as, in the lap&s;e of time and the revolution of govern|ments, cu&s;toms change and manners fluctuate; had a minute reprehen&s;ion of the fa&s;hions of the then exi&s;ting age been publi&s;hed in the New Te&s;tament, that por|tion of &s;cripture mu&s;t in time have become ob&s;olete, even in that very &s;ame country, when the fa&s;hions them&s;elves &s;hould have changed. And Paul and his brother apo&s;tles knew that their epi&s;tles would be the oracles of the Chri&s;tian world when the&s;e temporary diver&s;ions would be forgot|ten. In con&s;equence of this knowledge, by the univer&s;al precept to avoid <Q>the lu&s;t of the fle&s;h, the lu&s;t of the eye, and the pride of life,</Q> they have pre|pared
<PB N="198" REF="207">a la&s;ting antidote again&s;t the <HI>prin|ciple</HI> of all corrupt plea&s;ures, which will ever remain equally applicable to the loo&s;e fa&s;hions of all ages, and of every country to the end of the world.</P>
<P>To vindicate diver&s;ions therefore, which are in them&s;elves unchri&s;tian, on the pre|tended ground that they are not &s;pecific|ally condemned in the Go&s;pel, would be little le&s;s ab&s;urb than if the heroes of Newmarket &s;hould bring it as a proof that their periodical meetings are not con|demned in Scripture, becau&s;e St. Paul, when writing to the Corinthians, in avail|ing him&s;elf of the I&s;thmian games as a happy illu&s;tration of the Chri&s;tian race, did not drop any cen&s;ure on the practice it&s;elf: a practice which was indeed as much more pure than the races of Chri&s;|tian Britain, as the moderation of being contented with the triumph of a crown of leaves is &s;uperior to that criminal &s;pirit of gambling which iniquitou&s;ly enriches the victor by beggaring the competitor.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="208">But, as was &s;aid above, local abu&s;es were not the object of a book who&s;e in|&s;tructions were to be of univer&s;al and la&s;ting application. As a proof of this, little is &s;aid in the Go&s;pel of the then-exi&s;ting cor|ruption of polygamy; nothing again&s;t the &s;avage cu&s;tom of expo&s;ing children, or even again&s;t &s;lavery; nothing expre&s;sly again&s;t &s;uicide or duelling; the la&s;t Gothic cu&s;tom, indeed, did not exi&s;t among the crimes of <HI>Pagani&s;m.</HI> But is there not an implied prohibition again&s;t polygamy in the general denunciation again&s;t adultery? Is not expo&s;ing of children condemned in that charge again&s;t the Romans, that "they were without natural affection?" Is there not a &s;trong cen&s;ure again&s;t &s;lavery conveyed in the command to <Q>do unto others as you would have them do unto you?</Q> and again&s;t &s;uicide and duelling, in the general prohibition again&s;t murder, which is &s;trongly en|forced by the &s;olemn manner in which
<PB N="200" REF="209">murder is traced back to its fir&s;t &s;eed of anger in the &s;ermon on the mount.</P>
<P>Thus it is clear, that when Chri&s;t &s;ent the Go&s;pel to all nations, he meant that that Go&s;pel &s;hould proclaim tho&s;e prime truths, general laws, and fundamental doctrines, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily involve the prohibition of all peculiar, local, and inferior errors; errors which could not have been &s;pecifically guarded again&s;t, without having a di&s;tinct Go&s;pel for every country, or without &s;welling the divine volume into &s;uch inconvenient length as would have defeated one great end of its promulgation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"To the poor the Go&s;pel is preached," Luke, vii. 22.</NOTE> And while its lead|ing principles are of univer&s;al application, it mu&s;t always, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be left to the di&s;cretion of the preacher and to the con&s;cience of the hearer, to examine whether the life and habits of tho&s;e who profe&s;s it are conformable to its &s;pirit.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="210">The &s;ame Divine Spirit which indited the Holy Scriptures, is promi&s;ed to purify the hearts and renew the natures of re|penting and believing Chri&s;tians; and the compo&s;itions it in&s;pired are in &s;ome degree analogous to the workman&s;hip it effects. It prohibited the vicious practices of the apo&s;tolical days, by prohibiting the pa&s;&s;ions and principles which rendered them gratifying; and &s;till working in like manner on the hearts of real Chri&s;tians, it corrects the ta&s;te which was accu&s;tomed to find its proper gratification in the re&s;orts of vanity; and thus effectually provides for the reformation of the habits, and infu&s;es a reli&s;h for rational and dome&s;tic enjoy|ments, and for whatever can admini&s;ter plea&s;ure to that &s;pirit of peace, and love, and hope, and joy, which animates and rules the renewed heart of the true Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>But there is a portion of Scripture which, though to a &s;uperficial reader it may &s;eem but very remotely connected with the
<PB N="202" REF="211">pre&s;ent &s;ubject, yet to readers of another ca&s;t, it &s;eems to &s;ettle the matter beyond controver&s;y: In the parable of the great &s;upper, this important truth is held out to us, that even things <HI>good in them&s;elves</HI> may be the means of our eternal ruin, by drawing our hearts from God, and cau&s;ing us to make light of the offers of the Go&s;pel. One invited gue&s;t had bought an e&s;tate, another had made a purcha&s;e equally blamele&s;s of oxen; a third had married a wife, an act not illaudable in it&s;elf. They had all different rea&s;ons; but they all agreed in this, <HI>to decline the invitation to the &s;upper.</HI> The worldly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of one, the worldly bu&s;ine&s;s of another, and what &s;hould be particularly attended to, the love of a third to his deare&s;t relative, (a love by the way not only allowed but commanded in Scripture,) were brought forward as excu&s;es for not attending to the important bu&s;ine&s;s of religion. The con&s;equence however was the &s;ame to all. <Q>None
<PB N="203" REF="212">of tho&s;e which were bidden &s;hall ta&s;te of my &s;upper.</Q> If then things <HI>innocent,</HI> things <HI>nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> things <HI>laudable,</HI> things <HI>commanded,</HI> become &s;inful, when by un|&s;ea&s;onable or exce&s;&s;ive indulgence they detain the heart and affections from God, how vain will all tho&s;e arguments ne|ce&s;&s;arily be rendered which are urged by the advocates for certain amu&s;ements on the ground of their harmle&s;&s;ne&s;s; if tho&s;e amu&s;ements &s;erve (not to mention any po&s;itive evil which may belong to them) in like manner to draw away the thoughts and affections from all &s;piritual objects!</P>
<P>To conclude; when this topic happens to become the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation, in&s;tead of addre&s;&s;ing &s;evere and pointed attacks to young ladies on the &s;in of attending places of diver&s;ion, would it not be better fir&s;t to endeavour to excite in them that principle of Chri&s;tianity with which &s;uch diver&s;ions &s;eem not quite com|patible; as the phy&s;ician, who vi&s;its a patient in an eruptive fever, pays little

He attacks the &s;ever, he lowers the pul&s;e, he changes the &s;y&s;tem, he corrects the general habit; well knowing, that if he can but re&s;tore the vital principle of health, the &s;pots, which were nothing but &s;ymptoms, will die away of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In in&s;tructing others we &s;hould imitate our Lord and his Apo&s;tles, and not always aim our blow at each particular corruption; but making it our bu&s;ine&s;s to convince our pupil that what brings forth the evil fruit &s;he exhibits, cannot be a &s;lip of the true vine; we &s;hould thus avail our&s;elves of individual corruptions for im|pre&s;&s;ing her with a &s;en&s;e of the nece&s;&s;ity of purifying the common &s;ource from which they flow&mdash;a corrupt nature. Thus making it our grand bu&s;ine&s;s to rectify the heart, we pur&s;ue the true, the compen|dious,

<P>I would however take leave of tho&s;e amiable and not ill-di&s;po&s;ed young per&s;ons, who complain of the rigour of human prohibitions, and declare <Q>they meet with no &s;uch &s;trictne&s;s in the Go&s;pel,</Q> by a&s;king them with the mo&s;t affectionate earne&s;tne&s;s, if they can con&s;cientiou&s;ly reconcile their nightly attendance at every public place which they frequent, with &s;uch precepts as the following: <Q>Redeem|ing the time:&mdash;"Watch and pray:"&mdash; "Watch, for ye know not at what time your Lord cometh:"&mdash; "Ab&s;tain from all <HI>appearance</HI> of evil:"&mdash; "Set your affections on things above:"&mdash; "Be ye &s;piritually minded:"&mdash; "Crucify the fle&s;h with its affections and lu&s;ts?</Q> And I would venture to offer one criterion by which the per&s;ons in que&s;tion may be enabled to decide on the po&s;itive inno|cence and &s;afety of &s;uch diver&s;ions; but

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. <HI>A worldly &s;pirit incompatible with the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Is it not whim&s;ical to hear &s;uch complaints again&s;t the &s;trictne&s;s of religion as we are frequently hearing, from beings who are voluntarily pur&s;uing, as has been &s;hown in the preceding Chapters, a cour&s;e of life which Fa&s;hion makes infinitely more laborious? How really burden|&s;ome would Chri&s;tianity be if &s;he enjoined &s;uch &s;edulity of application, &s;uch unre|mitting labours, &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of fatigues! if religion commanded &s;uch hard&s;hips and &s;elf-denial, &s;uch days of hurry, &s;uch evenings of exertion, &s;uch nights of broken re&s;t, &s;uch perpetual &s;acrifices of quiet, &s;uch exile from family delights, as Fa&s;hion impo&s;es, then indeed
<PB N="210" REF="219">the &s;ervice of Chri&s;tianity would no longer merit its pre&s;ent appellation of being "a <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> &s;ervice:" then the name of perfect &s;lavery might be ju&s;tly applied to that which we are told in the beautiful language of our church, is "a &s;ervice of perfect freedom:" a &s;er|vice, the great object of which, is <Q>to deliver us from the bondage of cor|ruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</Q></P>
<P>A worldly temper, by which I mean a di&s;po&s;ition to prefer worldly plea&s;ures, worldly &s;atisfactions, and worldly advan|tages, to the immortal intere&s;ts of the &s;oul; and to let worldly con&s;iderations actuate us in&s;tead of the dictates of religion in the concerns of ordinary life; a worldly temper, I &s;ay, is not, like almo&s;t any other fault, the effect of pa&s;&s;ion or the con|&s;equence of &s;urpri&s;e when the heart is off its guard. It is not excited incidentally by the operation of external circum&s;tances on the infirmity of nature; but it is the vital
<PB N="211" REF="220">&s;pirit, the e&s;&s;ential &s;oul, the living principle of evil. It is not &s;o much an act, as a &s;tate of being; not &s;o much an oc|ca&s;ional complaint as a tainted con&s;titution of mind. If it do not always &s;how it&s;elf in extraordinary exce&s;&s;es, it has no perfect intermi&s;&s;ion. Even when it is not immediately tempted to break out into overt and &s;pecific acts, it is at work within, &s;tirring up the heart to di&s;affection again&s;t holine&s;s, and infu&s;ing a kind of moral di&s;ability to whatever is intrin&s;ically good. It infects and depraves all the powers and faculties of the &s;oul; for it operates on the under&s;tanding by blinding it to whatever is &s;piritually good; on the will, by making it aver&s;e from God; on the affections, by di&s;ordering and &s;en&s;ualizing them; &s;o that one may almo&s;t &s;ay to tho&s;e who are under the &s;upreme dominion of this &s;pirit, what was &s;aid to the ho&s;ts of Jo&s;hua, "Ye <HI>cannot</HI> &s;erve the Lord."</P>
<P>This worldline&s;s of mind is not at all commonly under&s;tood, and for the
<PB N="212" REF="221">following rea&s;on:&mdash;People &s;uppo&s;e that in this world our chief bu&s;ine&s;s is with the things of this world, and that to conduct the bu&s;ine&s;s of this world well, that is, conformably to moral principles, is the chief &s;ub&s;tance of moral and true good|ne&s;s. Religion, if introduced at all into the &s;y&s;tem, only makes its occa&s;ional and, if I may &s;o &s;peak, its holiday appearance. To bring religion into every thing, is thought incompatible with the due atten|tion to the things of this life. And &s;o it would, if by religion were meant <HI>talking</HI> about religion. The phra&s;e therefore is: <Q>One cannot always be praying; we mu&s;t mind our bu&s;ine&s;s and &s;ocial duties as well as our devotion.</Q> Worldly bu&s;ine&s;s being thus &s;ubjected to worldly, though in &s;ome degree moral, maxims, the mind during the conduct of bu&s;ine&s;s grows worldly; and a continually in|crea&s;ing worldly &s;pirit dims the &s;ight and relaxes the moral principle on which the affairs of the world are conducted, as well
<PB N="213" REF="222">as indi&s;po&s;es the mind for all the exerci&s;es of devotion.</P>
<P>But this temper, as far as relates to <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> a&s;&s;umes the &s;emblance of good|ne&s;s; &s;o that tho&s;e who have not right views are apt to mi&s;take the carrying on the affairs of life on a tolerably moral principle for religion. They do not &s;ee that the evil lies not in their &s;o carrying on bu&s;ine&s;s, but in their not carrying on the things of this life in &s;ub&s;erviency to tho&s;e of eternity; in their not carrying them on with the unintermitting idea of re&s;pon&s;ibility. The evil does not lie in their not being always on their knees, but in their not bringing their religion from the clo&s;et into the world: in their not bringing the &s;pirit of the Sunday's devo|tions into the tran&s;actions of the week: in not transforming their religion from a dry, and &s;peculative, and inoperative &s;y&s;tem, into a lively, and in&s;luential, and uncea&s;ing principle of action.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="223">Though there are, ble&s;&s;ed be God! in the mo&s;t exalted &s;tations, women who adorn their Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion by a con|&s;i&s;tent conduct; yet are there not others who are labouring hard to unite the irre|concileable intere&s;ts of earth and heaven? who, while they will not relinqui&s;h one jot of all this world has to be&s;tow, yet by no means renounce their hopes of a better? who do not think it unrea&s;onable that their indulging in the fulle&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of pre&s;ent plea&s;ure &s;hould interfere with the mo&s;t certain rever&s;ion of future glory? who, after living in the mo&s;t unbounded gratification of ea&s;e, vanity, and luxury, fancy that heaven mu&s;t be attached of cour&s;e to a life of which Chri&s;tianity was the outward profe&s;&s;ion, and which has not been &s;tained by any flagrant or di&s;honour|able act of guilt?</P>
<P>Are there not many who, while they entertain a re&s;pect for religion, (for I addre&s;s not the unbelieving or the licen|tious,)
<PB N="215" REF="224">while they believe its truths, ob|&s;erve its forms, and would be &s;hocked not to be thought religious, are yet im|mer&s;ed in this life of di&s;qualifying world|line&s;s? who, though they make a con|&s;cience of going to the public wor&s;hip once on a Sunday, and are &s;crupulou&s;ly ob&s;ervant of the other rites of the Church, yet he&s;itate not to give up all the re&s;t of their time to the very &s;ame pur&s;uits and plea&s;ures which occupy the hearts and lives of tho&s;e who&s;e enjoyment is not ob|&s;tructed by any dread of a future account? and who are acting on the wi&s;e principle of "the children of this generation" in making the mo&s;t of the pre&s;ent world from the conviction that there is no other to be expected.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be owned, indeed, that faith in un&s;een things is at times &s;adly weak and defective even in the truly pious; and that it is &s;o, is the &s;ubject of their grief and humiliation. O! how does the real Chri&s;tian take &s;hame in the coldne&s;s of
<PB N="216" REF="225">his belief, in the lowne&s;s of his attain|ments! How deeply does he lament that <Q>when he would do good evil is pre&s;ent with him!"&mdash; "that the life he now lives in the fle&s;h, is</Q> not, in the degree it ought to be, <Q>by faith in the &s;on of God!</Q> Yet one thing is clear, how|ever weak his belief may &s;eem to be, it is evident that his actions are mainly geverned by it; he evinces his &s;incerity to others by a life in &s;ome good degree ana|logous to the doctrines he profe&s;&s;es: while to him&s;elf he has this conviction, that faint as his confidence may be at times, yet at the wor&s;t of times he would not exchange that faint mea&s;ure of tru&s;t and hope for all the actual plea&s;ures and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of his mo&s;t &s;plendid acquaintance; and as a proof of his &s;incerity he never &s;eeks the cure of his dejection, where they &s;eek theirs, in the world, but in God.</P>
<P>But as to the faith of worldly per&s;ons, however &s;trong it may be in &s;peculation, however orthodox their creed, one cannot
<PB N="217" REF="226">help fearing that it is little defective in &s;incerity: for if there were in the mind a full per&s;ua&s;ion of the truth of revelation, and of the eternal bli&s;s it promi&s;es, would there not be more obvious diligence for its attainment? We di&s;cover great ardour in carrying on worldly projects, becau&s;e we believe the good which we are pur&s;uing is real, and will reward the trouble of the pur&s;uit: we believe it to be attainable by diligence, and prudently proportion our earne&s;tne&s;s to this conviction: but where we &s;ee per&s;ons profe&s;&s;ing a lively faith in a better world, yet labouring little to obtain an intere&s;t in it, can we forbear &s;u&s;pecting that their belief, not only of their own title to eternal happine&s;s, but of eternal happine&s;s it&s;elf, is not well grounded? and that, if they were to <Q>examine them|&s;elves truly,</Q> the faith would be found to be much of a piece with the practice?</P>
<P>Even that very ta&s;te for enjoyment which leads the per&s;ons in que&s;tion to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of the qualifications for
<PB N="218" REF="227">the plea&s;ures of the exi&s;ting &s;cene; that under&s;tanding which leads them to acquire tho&s;e talents which may enable them to reli&s;h the re&s;orts of gaiety here, &s;hould induce tho&s;e who are really looking for a future &s;tate of happine&s;s to wi&s;h to acquire &s;omething of the ta&s;te, and temper, and talents, which may be con&s;idered as qualifications for its enjoyment. The neglect to do this mu&s;t proceed from one of the&s;e two cau&s;es; either they mu&s;t think their pre&s;ent cour&s;e a &s;afe and pro|per cour&s;e; or they mu&s;t think that death is to produce &s;ome &s;udden and &s;urpri&s;ing alteration in the human character: but the office of death is to tran&s;port us to a new &s;tate, not to transform us to a new nature: the &s;troke of death is intended to effect our deliverance out of this world, and our introduction into another; but it is not likely to effect any &s;udden and &s;ur|pri&s;ing or total change in our hearts or our ta&s;tes: &s;o far from this, that we are a&s;&s;ured in Scripture, <Q>that he that is
<PB N="219" REF="228">filthy will be filthy &s;till, and he that is holy will be holy &s;till.</Q> Though we believe that death will completely clean&s;e the holy &s;oul from its remaining pollutions, that it will exchange defiling corruption into perfect purity, entangling temptation into complete freedom, want and pain into health and fruition, doubts and fears into perfect &s;ecurity, and oppre&s;&s;ive weari|ne&s;s into everla&s;ting re&s;t; yet there is no magic in the wand of death which will convert an unholy &s;oul into a holy one. And it is awful to reflect, that &s;uch tempers as have the allowed predominance here will maintain it for ever: that &s;uch as the will is when we clo&s;e our eyes upon the things of time, &s;uch it will be when we open them on tho&s;e of eternity. The mere act of death no more fits us for heaven, than the mere act of the ma&s;on who pulls down our old hou&s;e fits us for a new one. If we die with our hearts running over with the love of the world, there is no promi&s;e to lead us to expect
<PB N="220" REF="229">that we &s;hall ri&s;e with them full of the love of God: death indeed will &s;hew us to our&s;elves &s;uch as we are, but will not make us &s;uch as we are not: and it will be too late to be acquiring &s;elf-knowledge when we can no longer turn it to any account but that of tormenting our&s;elves. To illu&s;trate this truth &s;till farther by an allu&s;ion familiar to the per&s;ons I addre&s;s: the drawing up the curtain at the theatre, though it &s;erves to introduce us to the entertainments behind it, does not create in us any new faculties to under&s;tand or to reli&s;h the&s;e entertainments: the&s;e mu&s;t have been long in acquiring; they mu&s;t have been provided beforehand, and brought with us to the place, if we would reli&s;h the plea&s;utes of the place; for the entertainment can only operate on that ta&s;te we carry to it. It is too late to be acquiring when we ought to be enjoying.</P>
<P>That &s;pirit of prayer and prai&s;e, tho&s;e di&s;po&s;itions of love, meekne&s;s, <Q>peace, quietne&s;s, and a&s;&s;urance;</Q> that indif|ference
<PB N="221" REF="230">to the fa&s;hion of a world which is pa&s;&s;ing away; that longing after deliver|ance from &s;in, that de&s;ire of holine&s;s, to|gether with all the &s;pecific marks of the &s;pirit here, mu&s;t &s;urely make &s;ome part of our qualification for the enjoyment of a world, the plea&s;ures of which are all &s;piritual. And who can conceive any thing equal to the awful &s;urpri&s;e of a &s;oul long immer&s;ed in the indulgencies of vanity and plea&s;ure, yet all the while lulled by the &s;elf-complacency of a religion of mere forms; who, while it counted upon heaven as a thing of cour&s;e, had made no preparation for it; who can conceive any &s;urpri&s;e equal to that of &s;uch a &s;oul on &s;hutting its eyes on a world of &s;en&s;e, of which all the objects and delights were &s;o congenial to its nature, and opening them on a world of &s;pirits of which all the cha|racters of enjoyment are of a nature new, unknown, &s;urpri&s;ing, and &s;pecifically dif|ferent? plea&s;ures as inconceivable to its apprehen&s;ion and as un&s;uitable to its ta&s;te,
<PB N="222" REF="231">as the gratifications of one &s;en&s;e are to the organs of another, or as the mo&s;t ex|qui&s;ite works of genius to ab&s;olute imbe|cility of mind.</P>
<P>While we would with deep humility confe&s;s that we cannot purcha&s;e heaven by any works or right di&s;po&s;itions of our own, while we gratefully ac|knowledge that it mu&s;t be purcha&s;ed for us by <Q>Him who loved us, and wa&s;hed us from our &s;ins in his blood;</Q> yet let us remember that we have no rea&s;on to expect we could be capable of enjoying the plea&s;ures of a heaven &s;o purcha&s;ed without heavenly mindedne&s;s. When tho&s;e per&s;ons who are apt to expect as much comfort from religion as if their hearts were not full of the world, now and then, in a fit of hone&s;ty and low &s;pirits, complain that Chri&s;tianity does not make them as good and as happy as they were led to expect from that a&s;&s;ur|ance, that <Q>great peace have they who love the Lord," and that "they who
<PB N="223" REF="232">wait on him &s;hall want no manner of thing that is good;</Q> when they lament that the paths of religion are not tho&s;e "paths of plea&s;antne&s;s" they were led to expect; their ca&s;e reminds one of a cele|brated phy&s;ician who u&s;ed to &s;ay, that the rea&s;on why his pre&s;criptions, which commonly cured the poor and the tem|perate, did &s;o little good among his rich luxurious patients, was, that while he was labouring to remove the di&s;ea&s;e by medi|cines, of which they only took drams, grains, and &s;cruples; they were inflaming it by a multiplicity of injurious aliments which they &s;wallowed by ounces, pounds, and pints.</P>
<P>The&s;e fa&s;hionable Chri&s;tians &s;hould be reminded that there was no half engage|ment made for them at their bapti&s;m; that they are not partly their own and partly their Redeemer's. He that is <Q>bought with a price</Q> is the &s;ole property of the purcha&s;er. Faith does not con&s;i&s;t merely in &s;ubmitting the opinions of the
<PB N="224" REF="233">under&s;tanding, but the di&s;po&s;itions of the heart: religion is not a &s;acrifice of &s;en|timents but of affections: it is not the tribute of fear, extorted from a flave, but the voluntary homage of love paid by a child.</P>
<P>Neither does a Chri&s;tian's piety con&s;i&s;t in living in retreat and railing at the prac|tices of the world, while, perhaps, her heart is full of the &s;pirit of that world at which &s;he is railing: but it con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>&s;ubduing</HI> the &s;pirit of the world and op|po&s;ing its practices even while her duty obliges her to live in it.</P>
<P>Nor is the &s;pirit or the love of the world confined to tho&s;e only who are making a figure in it; nor are its opera|tions bounded by the precincts of the metropolis nor the limited regions of fir&s;t rate rank and &s;plendor. She who inveighs again&s;t the luxury and exce&s;&s;es of London, and &s;olaces her&s;elf in her own comparative fobriety, becau&s;e her more circum&s;cribed fortune compels her to take
<PB N="225" REF="234">up with the &s;econd-hand plea&s;ures of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive watering-places, which plea&s;ures &s;he pur&s;ues with avidity, is governed by the &s;ame &s;pirit: and &s;he who&s;e &s;till nar|rower opportunities &s;tint her to the petty diver&s;ions of her provincial town, if &s;he be bu&s;ied in &s;welling and enlarging her own &s;maller &s;phere of vanity and idlene&s;s, however &s;he may comfort her&s;elf with her own comparative goodne&s;s by railing at the unattainable plea&s;ures of the water|ing-place, or of the capital, is governed by the &s;ame &s;pirit: for &s;he who is as vain, as di&s;&s;ipated, and as extravagant as exi&s;ting circum&s;tances admit, would be as vain, as di&s;&s;ipated and as extravagant as the gaye&s;t objects of her invective now are, if &s;he could change places with them. It is not merely by what we do that we can be &s;ure the &s;pirit of the world has no dominion over us, but by fairly con|&s;idering what we &s;hould probably do if more were in our power.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="235">The worldly Chri&s;tian, if I may be allowed &s;uch a contradiction in terms, mu&s;t not imagine that &s;he acquits her&s;elf of her religious obligations by her mere weekly oblation of prayer. There is no covenant by which communion with God is re&s;tricted to an hour or two on the Sunday: &s;he does not acquit her&s;elf by &s;etting apart a few particular days in the year for the exerci&s;e of a periodical devotion, and then flying back to the world as eagerly as if &s;he were re&s;olved to repay her&s;elf largely for her &s;hort fit of &s;elf-denial; the &s;tream of plea&s;ure running with a more rapid current from having been interrupted by this forced ob&s;truction. And the avidity with which one has &s;een certain per&s;ons of a &s;till le&s;s correct character, than the cla&s;s we have been con&s;idering, return to a whole year's carnival, after the &s;elf-impo&s;ed penance of a Pa&s;&s;ion week, gives a &s;hrewd intima|tion that they con&s;idered the temporary
<PB N="227" REF="236">ab&s;traction, le&s;s as an act of penitence for the pa&s;t, than as a purcha&s;e of indemnity for the future. Such bare-weight pro|te&s;tants prudently condition for retaining the Popi&s;h doctrine of indulgences, which they buy, not indeed of the late &s;piritual court of Rome, but of that &s;ecret, &s;elf|acquitting judge, which, ignorance of its own turpitude and of the &s;trict require|ments of the divine law has e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;upreme in the tribunal of every unre|newed heart.</P>
<P>But the practice of &s;elf-examination is impeded with one clog, which renders it peculiarly inconvenient to the gay and worldly: for the royal prophet (who was, however, him&s;elf as likely as any one to be acquainted with the difficulties peculiar to greatne&s;s) has annexed as an indi&s;pen|&s;able concomitant to <Q>communing with our own heart</Q> that we &s;hould <HI>"be &s;till."</HI> Now this clau&s;e of the injuction renders the other part of it not a little incon&s;i&s;tent with the pre&s;ent habits of fa&s;hionable life,
<PB N="228" REF="237">of which <HI>&s;tillne&s;s</HI> is clearly not one of the con&s;tituents. It would, however, greatly a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e who do not altogether decline the practice, if they e&s;tabli&s;hed into a rule the habit of detecting certain &s;u&s;pi|cious practices, by realizing them, as it were, to their own minds, by drawing them out in detail, and placing them before their eyes cloathed in language; for there is nothing that &s;o effectually expo&s;es an ab&s;urdity which has pa&s;&s;ed mu&s;ter for want of &s;uch an inqui&s;ition, as giving it &s;hape and form. How many things which now work them&s;elves into the habit, and pa&s;s current, would then &s;hock us by their palpable incon&s;i&s;tency!

<PB N="230" REF="239">that is, as long as the world &s;hall la&s;t. It is well to call off the thoughts, even for a &s;hort time, not only from &s;in and vanity, but even from the lawful pur&s;uits of bu&s;ine&s;s, and the laudable cares of life; and, at times, to annihilate as it were, the &s;pace which divides us from eternity.</P>
<Q><L>'Tis greatly wi&s;e to talk with our pa&s;t hours,</L>

<P>Yet to tho&s;e who &s;eek a &s;hort annual retreat as a mere form; who dignify with the idea of a religious retirement a week when it is rather unfa&s;hionable to be &s;een in town; who retire with an unabated re&s;olution to return to the maxims, the plea&s;ures, and the &s;pirit of that world which they are going mechanically to renounce; is it not to be feared that &s;uch a &s;hort &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which does not even pretend to &s;ubdue the principle, but only to &s;u&s;pend the act, may only &s;erve to &s;et a keener edge on the appetite for
<PB N="231" REF="240">the plea&s;ures they are quitting? Is is not to be feared that the bow may fly back with redoubled violence from having been unnaturally bent? That by varni&s;hing over a life of vanity with the externals of a formal and temporary piety, they may not more dangerou&s;ly &s;kin over the trouble|&s;ome &s;ome &s;orene&s;s of a tender con&s;cience, by laying This &s;lattering unction to the &s;oul. For is it not among the delu&s;ions of a worldly piety to con&s;ider Chri&s;tianity as a thing which cannot, indeed, &s;afely be omitted, but which is to <HI>be got over;</HI> a certain quantity of which is, as it were, to be taken in the lump, with long intervals between the repetitions? To con&s;ider reli|gion as impo&s;ing a &s;et of hard&s;hips, which <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be occa&s;ionally encountered in order to procure a peaceable enjoyment of the long re&s;pite? That the&s;e &s;evere conditions thus fulfilled, the acquitted Chri&s;tian having paid the annual demand of a rigor|ous
<PB N="232" REF="241">requi&s;ition, &s;he may now lawfully re|turn to her natural &s;tate, and the old reckoning being adju&s;ted, &s;he may begin a new &s;core, and receive the reward of her punctual obedience in the re&s;umed indulgence of tho&s;e gratifications, which &s;he had for a &s;hort time laid a&s;ide as a hard ta&s;k to plea&s;e a hard ma&s;ter: but this ta&s;k performed, and the ma&s;ter ap|pea&s;ed, the mind may di&s;cover its natural bent, in joyfully returning to the objects of its real choice? Whereas, is it not clear that if the religious exerci&s;es had pro|duced the effect which it is the nature of true religion to produce, the penitent <HI>could</HI> not return with her old genuine alacrity to tho&s;e habits of the world, from which the pious weekly manuals through which &s;he has been labouring with the punctuality of an almanack as to the day, and the accuracy of a bead-roll as to the number, was intended by the devout authors to re&s;cue their reader?</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="242">I am far from in&s;inuating that this literal &s;eque&s;tration ought to be prolonged throughout the year, or that all the days of bu&s;ine&s;s are to be made equally days of &s;olemnity and continued meditation. This earth is a place in which a much larger portion of a common Chri&s;tian's time mu&s;t be a&s;&s;igned to action than to con|templation. Women of the higher cla&s;s were not &s;ent into the world to &s;hun &s;ociety but to improve it. They were not de&s;igned for the cold and vi&s;ionary virtues of &s;olitudes and mona&s;teries, but for the amiable and endearing offices of &s;ocial life; they are of a religion which does not impo&s;e idle au&s;terities, but enjoins active duties; a religion of which the mo&s;t benevolent actions require to be &s;anctified by the pure&s;t motives; a religion which does not condemn its followers to the comparatively ea&s;y ta&s;k of &s;eclu&s;ion from the world, but a&s;&s;igns them the more difficult province of living uncorrupted in it; which, while it forbids them to
<PB N="234" REF="243">"follow a multitude to do evil," includes in that prohibition the &s;in of doing nothing, and which moreover enjoins them to be followers of him <Q>who went about doing good.</Q></P>
<P>But may we not rea&s;onably contend that though the &s;ame &s;eque&s;tration is not required, yet that the &s;ame <HI>&s;pirit</HI> and <HI>temper</HI> which one hopes is thought ne|ce&s;&s;ary by all during the occa&s;ional humi|liation, mu&s;t by every real Chri&s;tian be extended throughout all the periods of the year? And when that is really the ca&s;e, when once the &s;pirit of religion &s;hall indeed govern the heart, it will not only animate her religious actions and employments, but will gradually extend it&s;elf to the cha&s;ti&s;ing her conver&s;ation, will di&s;cipline her thoughts, influence her common bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;anctify her very plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>But it &s;hould &s;eem that many who entertain a <HI>general</HI> notion of Chri&s;tian duty do not con&s;ider it as of univer&s;al and unremitting obligation, but rather as a
<PB N="235" REF="244">duty binding at times on all, and always on &s;ome. To the attention of &s;uch we would recommend that very explicit ad|dre&s;s of our Lord on the &s;ubject of &s;elf-denial, the temper directly oppo&s;ed to a worldly &s;pirit: <Q>And he &s;aid unto them ALL if any man will come after me, let him deny him&s;elf, and take up his cro&s;s DAILY.</Q> Tho&s;e who think &s;elf-denial not of <HI>univer&s;al</HI> obligation will ob&s;erve the word <HI>all,</HI> and tho&s;e who think the obligation not <HI>con&s;tant</HI> will attend to the term <HI>daily.</HI> The&s;e two little words cut up by the root all the occa&s;ional reli|gious ob&s;ervances grafted on a worldly life.</P>
<P>There is indeed &s;carcely a more pitiable being than one who in&s;tead of making her religion the informing principle of all &s;he does, has only ju&s;t enough to keep her in continual fear; who drudges through her &s;tinted exerci&s;es with a &s;uper&s;titious kind of terror, while her general life &s;hows that the love of God is not the governing prin|ciple
<PB N="236" REF="245">in her heart: Who &s;eems to &s;uffer all the pains and penalties of Chri&s;t|ianity, but is a &s;tranger to <Q>that liberty wherewith Chri&s;t has made us free.</Q> Let it not be thought a ludicrous invention if the author hazard the producing a real illu&s;tration of the&s;e remarks in the in&s;tance of a lady of this &s;tamp, who returning from church on a very cold day, and remarking with a good deal of &s;elf-com|placency how much &s;he had &s;uffered in the performance of her duty, comforted her|&s;elf with adding, <Q>that &s;he hoped how|ever it would <HI>an&s;wer.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But there is no comfort in any religion &s;hort of that by which the diligent Chri&s;t|ian &s;trives that all his actions &s;hall have the love of God for their motive, and the glory of God for their end; while to go about to balance one's good and bad actions one again&s;t the other, and to take comfort in the occa&s;ional predominance of the former, while the cultivation of the principle from which they &s;hould &s;pring
<PB N="237" REF="246">is neglected, is not the road to all tho&s;e peaceful fruits of the &s;pirit to which true Chri&s;tianity conducts the humble and penitent believer.</P>
<P>But I am aware that a better ca&s;t of characters than tho&s;e we have been con|templating; that even the amiable and the well-di&s;po&s;ed, who while they want courage to re&s;i&s;t what they have too much principle to think right, and too much &s;en&s;e to ju&s;tify, will yet plead for the <HI>palliating</HI> &s;y&s;tem, and accu&s;e the&s;e remarks of unnece&s;&s;ary rigour. They will declare <Q>that really they are as religious as they can be; they wi&s;h they were better; they have little &s;atisfaction in the life they are leading, yet they cannot break with the world; they cannot fly in the face of cu&s;tom; it does not become in|dividuals like them to oppo&s;e the torrent of fa&s;hion.</Q> Beings &s;o intere&s;ting abounding with engaging qualities; who not only feel the beauty of goodne&s;s but reverence the truths of Chri&s;tianity, and
<PB N="238" REF="247">are awfully looking for a general judg|ment, one is grieved to hear lament "that they only do as others do," when they are perhaps them&s;elves of &s;uch rank and importance that if they would begin to do right, others would be brought to do as they did. One is grieved to hear them indolently a&s;&s;ert that <Q>they wi&s;h it were otherwi&s;e,</Q> when they po&s;&s;e&s;s the power to <HI>make</HI> it otherwi&s;e, by &s;etting an example which they know would be followed. One is &s;orry to hear them content them|&s;elves with declaring, that <Q>they have not the courage to be &s;ingular,</Q> when they mu&s;t feel by &s;eeing the influence of their example in wor&s;e things, that there would be no &s;ingularity in piety it&s;elf, if once <HI>they</HI> became &s;incerely pious. Be&s;ides, this diffidence does not break out on other occa&s;ions. They do not blu&s;h to be quoted as the oppo&s;ers of an old mode or the inventors of a new one. Nor are they equally backward in being the fir&s;t to appear in a &s;trange
<PB N="239" REF="248">fa&s;hion, &s;uch an one as often excites won|der, and &s;ometimes even offends again&s;t delicacy. Let not then diffidence be pleaded as an excu&s;e only on occa&s;ions wherein courage would be virtue.</P>
<P>Will it be thought too har&s;h a que&s;tion if we venture to a&s;k the&s;e gentle cha|racters who are thus intrenching them|&s;elves in the imaginary &s;afety of multitudes, and who &s;ay "we only do as others do," whether they are willing to run the tremendous ri&s;k of con&s;equences, and <HI>to fare as others fare?</HI></P>
<P>But while the&s;e plead the authority of Fa&s;hion as a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for their conformity to the world, one who pleads a paramount authority po&s;itively &s;ays, <Q>Be ye <HI>not</HI> conformed to the world.</Q> Nay, it is urged as the very badge and di&s;tinction by which the character oppo&s;ite to the Chri&s;tian is to be marked, <Q>that the friend&s;hip of the world is <HI>enmity</HI> with God.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="249">Temptation to conform to the world was never perhaps more irre&s;i&s;tible than in the days which immediately preceded the Deluge. And no man could ever have pleaded the <HI>fa&s;hion</HI> in order to ju&s;tify a criminal a&s;&s;imilation with the reigning manners, with more propriety than the Patriarch Noah. He had the two grand and contending objects of terror to en|counter which we have; the fear of ridi|cule, and the fear of de&s;truction; the dread of &s;in, and the dread of &s;ingularity. Our cau&s;e of alarm is at lea&s;t equally pre&s;&s;ing with his; for it does not appear, even while he was actually obeying the Divine command in providing the means of his future &s;afety, that he <HI>&s;aw</HI> any actual &s;ymptoms of the impending ruin. So that in one &s;en&s;e <HI>he</HI> might have truly pleaded as an excu&s;e for &s;lackne&s;s of pre|paration, <Q>that all things continued as they were from the beginning;</Q> while many of us, though the &s;torm is begun,
<PB N="241" REF="250">never think of providing the refuge: though we have had a fuller revelation, have &s;een Scripture illu&s;trating, prophecy ful|filling, with every awful circum&s;tance that can either quicken the mo&s;t &s;luggi&s;h re|mi&s;&s;ne&s;s, or confirm the feeble&s;t faith.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the Patriarch's plea for follow|ing the fa&s;hion was &s;tronger than you can produce. While you mu&s;t &s;ee that many are going wrong, he &s;aw that none were going right. <Q>All fle&s;h had corrupted his way before God;</Q> whil&s;t, ble&s;&s;ed be God! you have &s;till in&s;tances enough of piety to keep you in countenance. While you lament that the world &s;educes you, (for every one has a little world of his own,) your world perhaps is only a petty neighbourhood, a few &s;treets and &s;quares; but the Patriarch had really the contagion of a whole united world to re&s;i&s;t: he had literally the example of the whole face of the earth to oppo&s;e. The "fear of man" al&s;o would then have been a more pardonable fault, when the
<PB N="242" REF="251">lives of the &s;ame individuals who were likely to excite re&s;pect or fear was pro|longed many ages, than it can be in the &s;hort period now a&s;&s;igned to human life. And that opinion &s;hould operate &s;till le&s;s powerfully which is the breath of a being &s;o frail and &s;o &s;hort-lived,
<Q><L>That he doth cea&s;e to be,</L>
<L>E'er one can &s;ay he is.</L></Q>
You who find it &s;o difficult to with&s;tand the individual allurement of one modi&s;h acquaintance, would in the Patriarch's ca&s;e have concluded the &s;truggle to be quite ineffectual, and would have &s;unk under the &s;uppo&s;ed fruitle&s;&s;ne&s;s of re&s;i&s;tance. "My&s;elf," would you not have &s;aid? <Q>or at mo&s;t my little family of eight per&s;ons can never hope to &s;top this torrent of corruption; I lament the fruitle&s;&s;ne&s;s of oppo&s;ition; I deplore the nece&s;&s;ity of conformity with the prevailing &s;y&s;tem: but it would be a fooli&s;h pre&s;umption to hope that one family can effect a
<PB N="243" REF="252">change in the &s;tate of the world.</Q> In your own ca&s;e, however, it is not certain to how wide an extent the hearty union of even fewer per&s;ons in &s;uch a cau&s;e might reach: at lea&s;t is it nothing to do what the Patriarch did? was it nothing to pre&s;erve him&s;elf from the general de&s;truction? was it nothing to deliver his own &s;oul? was it nothing to re&s;cue the &s;ouls of his whole family?</P>
<P>It is certainly a mark of a &s;ound judg|ment to comply with the world when|ever we &s;afely can; &s;uch compliance &s;trengthens our influence by re&s;erving to our&s;elves the greater weight of authority on tho&s;e occa&s;ions, when our con&s;cience obliges us to differ. Tho&s;e who are wi&s;e will cheerfully conform to all its innocent u&s;ages; but tho&s;e who are Chri&s;tians will be &s;crupulous in defining which are really innocent previous to their conformity to them. Not what the world, but what the Go&s;pel calls innocent will be found
<PB N="244" REF="253">at the grand &s;crutiny to have been really &s;o. A di&s;creet Chri&s;tian will take due pains to be convinced he is right before he will pre&s;ume to be &s;ingular: but from the in&s;tant he is per&s;uaded that the Go&s;pel is true, and the world of cour&s;e wrong, he will no longer ri&s;k his &s;afety by following multitudes, or his &s;oul by &s;taking it on human opinion. All our mo&s;t dangerous mi&s;takes ari&s;e from our not con&s;tantly referring our practice to the &s;tandard of &s;cripture, in&s;tead of the mutable &s;tandard of human opinion, by which it is impo&s;&s;ible to fix the real value of characters. For this latter &s;tandard in &s;ome ca&s;es determines tho&s;e to be good who do not run all the lengths in which the notoriou&s;ly bad allow them&s;elves. The Go&s;pel has an univer&s;al, the world has a local &s;tandard of goodne&s;s: in &s;ome &s;ocieties certain vices alone are di&s;honour|able, &s;uch as covetou&s;ne&s;s and cowardice; while tho&s;e &s;ins of which our Saviour has
<PB N="245" REF="254">&s;aid, that they which commit them <Q>&s;hall not inherit the kingdom of God,</Q> detract nothing from the re&s;pect &s;ome per&s;ons receive. Nay tho&s;e very charac|ters, whom the Almighty has expre&s;sly declared "He will judge <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hebrews, xiii. 4.</NOTE>" are received, are care&s;&s;ed, in that which calls it&s;elf the be&s;t company.</P>
<P>But to weigh our actions by one &s;tand|ard now, when we know they will be judged by another hereafter, would be reckoned the height of ab&s;urdity in any tran&s;actions but tho&s;e which involve the intere&s;ts of eternity. <Q>How reade&s;t thou?</Q> is a more &s;pecific direction than any comparative view of our own habits with the habits of others: and at the final bar it will be of little avail that our actions have ri&s;en above tho&s;e of bad men, if our views and principles &s;hall be found to have been in oppo&s;ition to the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="255">Nor is <HI>their</HI> practice more commend|able, who are ever on the watch to pick out the wor&s;t actions of good men, by way of ju&s;tifying their own conduct on the compari&s;on. The faults of the be&s;t men, <Q>for there is not a ju&s;t man upon the earth who &s;inneth not,</Q> can in no wi&s;e ju&s;tify the errors of the wor&s;t: and it is not invariably the example of even good men that we mu&s;t take for our un|erring rule of conduct: nor is it by a &s;ingle action that either they or we &s;hall be judged, for in that ca&s;e who could be &s;aved? but it is by the general prevalence of right principles and good habits; by the predominance of holine&s;s and righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and temperance in the life, and by the power of humility, faith and love in the heart.</P>

<P>THE author having in this little work taken a view of the fal&s;e notions often imbibed in early life from a bad education, and of their pernicious effects; and having attempted to point out the re&s;pective re|medies to the&s;e, &s;he would now draw all that has been &s;aid to a point, and declare plainly what &s;he humbly conceives to be the &s;ource whence all the&s;e fal&s;e notions, and this wrong conduct, have procedeed: The prophet Jeremiah &s;hall an&s;wer, <Q>It is becau&s;e they have for&s;aken the foun|tain of living waters, and have hewn
<PB N="248" REF="257">out to them&s;elves ci&s;terns, broken ci&s;|terns that can hold no water:</Q> it is an ignorance pa&s;t belief of what Chri&s;t|ianity really is: the remedy, therefore, and the only remedy that can be applied with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, is RELIGION, and by Religion &s;he would be under&s;tood to mean the Go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>It has been before hinted, that Religion &s;hould be taught at an early period of life; that children &s;hould be <HI>brought up</HI><Q>in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</Q> The <HI>manner</HI> in which they &s;hould be taught has likewi&s;e with great plainne&s;s been &s;ugge&s;ted; that it &s;hould be done in &s;o lively and familiar a manner as to make Religion amiable, and her ways to appear, what they really are, "ways of plea&s;antne&s;s." And a &s;light &s;ketch has been given of the genius of Chri&s;tianity, by which her amiablene&s;s would more clearly appear. But this, being a &s;ubject of &s;uch va&s;t importance, compared with which every other &s;ubject &s;inks into nothing; it &s;eems not &s;ufficient to
<PB N="249" REF="258">&s;peak on the doctrines and duties of Chri&s;t|ianity in <HI>detached</HI> parts, but it is of importance to point out, though in a brief manner, the mutual dependence of one doctrine upon another, and the influence which the&s;e doc|trines have upon the heart and life, &s;o that the <HI>duties</HI> of Chri&s;tianity may be &s;een to grow out of its <HI>doctrines:</HI> by which it will ap|pear that Chri&s;tian virtue differs <HI>e&s;&s;entially</HI> from Pagan: it is of a quite different kind: the plant it&s;elf is different, it comes from a different root, and grows in a dif|ferent &s;oil.</P>
<P>By this it will be &s;een how the hum|bling doctrine of the di&s;obedience of our fir&s;t parents, and the con&s;equent corrup|tion of human nature, make way for the bright di&s;play of redeeming love. How from the aba&s;ing thought that <Q>we are all as &s;heep going a&s;tray, every one in his own way:</Q> that none <HI>can</HI> return to the &s;hepherd of our &s;ouls, <Q>except the Father draw him:</Q> that <Q>the natural man <HI>cannot</HI> receive the things
<PB N="250" REF="259">of the &s;pirit, becau&s;e they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned:</Q> how from this humiliating view of the <HI>helple&s;&s;ne&s;s,</HI> as well as the <HI>guilt</HI> and <HI>corruption</HI> of human nature, we are to turn to that animating doctrine, the offer of <HI>divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</HI> So that though human nature will appear from this view in a deeply degraded &s;tate, and con&s;equently <HI>all</HI> have cau&s;e for humility, yet not one has cau&s;e for de&s;pair: the di&s;ea&s;e indeed is dreadful, but a phy&s;ician is at hand, both able and willing to &s;ave us: though we are naturally <Q>without &s;trength, our help is laid upon one that is mighty.</Q></P>
<P>We &s;hould ob&s;erve then, that the doc|trines of our Saviour are, if I may &s;o &s;peak, like his coat, all woven into one piece. We &s;hould get &s;uch a view of their reciprocal dependence as to be per|&s;uaded that without a deep &s;en&s;e of our own corruptions we can never &s;eriou&s;ly believe in a Saviour, becau&s;e the &s;ub&s;tan|tial and acceptable belief in Him mu&s;t
<PB N="251" REF="260">always ari&s;e from the conviction of our want of Him. That without a firm per|&s;ua&s;ion that the Holy Spirit can alone re&s;tore our fallen nature, repair the ruins of &s;in, and renew the image of God upon the heart, we never &s;hall be brought to &s;erious, humble prayer for repentance and re&s;toration; and that, without this repentance there is no &s;alvation: for though Chri&s;t has died for us, and con|&s;equently to Him alone we mu&s;t look as a Saviour, yet He has him&s;elf declared that He will &s;ave none but true penitents.</P>

<HEAD>ON THE DOCTRINE OF HUMAN COR|RUPTION.</HEAD>
<P>To come now to a more particular &s;tatement of the&s;e doctrines.&mdash;When an important edifice is about to be erected, a wi&s;e builder will dig deep, and look well to the foundations, knowing that without this the fabric will not be likely to &s;tand.
<PB N="252" REF="261">The foundation of the Chri&s;tian religion, out of which the whole &s;tructure may be &s;aid to ari&s;e, appears to be the doctrine of the fall of man from his original &s;tate of righteou&s;ne&s;s; and the corruption, guilt, and helple&s;&s;ne&s;s of human nature, which are the con&s;equences of this fall, and which is the natural &s;tate of every one born into the world. To this doctrine it is important to conciliate the minds, more e&s;pecially of young per&s;ons, who are pecu|liarly di&s;po&s;ed to turn away from it as a moro&s;e, unamiable, and gloomy idea: they are apt to accu&s;e tho&s;e who are more &s;trict and &s;erious, of unnece&s;&s;ary &s;everity, and to &s;u&s;pect them of thinking unju&s;tly ill of mankind. The rea&s;ons which pre|judice the inexperienced again&s;t the doc|trine in que&s;tion appear to be the follow|ing.</P>
<P>Young per&s;ons them&s;elves have &s;een little of the world. In plea&s;urable &s;ociety the world puts on its mo&s;t amiable ap|pearance; and that &s;oftne&s;s and urbanity
<PB N="253" REF="262">which prevail, particularly among&s;t per|&s;ons of fa&s;hion, are liable to be mi&s;taken for more than they are really worth. The oppo&s;ition to this doctrine in the young, ari&s;es partly from ingenuou&s;ne&s;s of heart, partly from indulging them&s;elves in favor|able &s;uppo&s;itions re&s;pecting the world, rather than of pur&s;uing truth, which is always the grand thing to be pur&s;ued; and partly from the popularity of the tenet, <HI>that every body is &s;o wonderfully good.</HI></P>
<P>Now the error it&s;elf in youth ari&s;es from their not having a right &s;tandard of moral good and evil them&s;elves; that they are apt to have no very &s;trict &s;en&s;e of duty, or of the nece&s;&s;ity of a right and re|ligious motive to every act.</P>
<P>Moreover, young people are apt not to know them&s;elves. Not having yet been much expo&s;ed to temptation, owing to the prudent re&s;traints in which they have been kept, they little &s;u&s;pect to what lengths in vice they them&s;elves are liable to be
<PB N="254" REF="263">carried, nor how far others actually are carried who are &s;et free from tho&s;e re|&s;traints.</P>
<P>Having laid down the&s;e as &s;ome of the cau&s;es of error on this point, I proceed to ob&s;erve on what &s;trong grounds the doctrine it&s;elf &s;tands.</P>
<P>Profane hi&s;tory abundantly confirms this truth: the hi&s;tory of the world being in fact little el&s;e than the hi&s;tory of the crimes of the human race. Even though the annals of remote ages lie &s;o involved in ob&s;curity, that &s;ome degree of uncer|tainty attaches it&s;elf to many of the events recorded, yet this one truth is always clear, that mo&s;t of the mi&s;eries which have been brought upon mankind, have proceeded from this innate depravity.</P>
<P>The world we live in furni&s;hes abundant proof of this truth. In a world formed on the deceitful theory of tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ert the innocence and dignity of man, almo&s;t all the profe&s;&s;ions, as they would have been rendered u&s;ele&s;s by &s;uch a &s;tate of
<PB N="255" REF="264">innocence, would not have exi&s;ted. With|out &s;in there would have been no &s;ickne&s;s; every medical profe&s;&s;or is a &s;tanding evi|dence of this &s;ad truth. Sin not only brought &s;ickne&s;s but death into the world; con&s;equently every funeral pre&s;ents a more irrefragable argument than a thou&s;and &s;ermons. Had man per&s;evered in his original integrity, there could have been no litiga|tion, for there would be no conte&s;ts about property in a world where none would be inclined to attack it. Profe&s;&s;ors of law, therefore, from the attorney who pro&s;ecutes for a tre&s;pa&s;s, to the pleader who defends a criminal, or the judge who condemns him, loudly confirm the doctrine. Every victory by &s;ea or land &s;hould teach us to rejoice with humiliation, for conque&s;t it&s;elf brings a terrible, though &s;plendid atte&s;tation to the truth of the fall of man.</P>
<P>Even tho&s;e who deny the doctrine, act univer&s;ally on the principle. Why do we all &s;ecure our hou&s;es with bolts, and bars,
<PB N="256" REF="265">and locks? Do we take the&s;e &s;teps to defend our lives or property from any <HI>particular</HI> fear? from any &s;u&s;picion of this neighbour, or that &s;ervant, or the other invader? No:&mdash;It is from a practical conviction of human depravity; from a con&s;tant pervading, but undefined dread of impending evil ari&s;ing from an inbred &s;en&s;e of general corruption. Are not pri&s;ons built and laws enacted on the &s;ame practical principle?</P>
<P>But not to de&s;cend to the more degraded part of our &s;pecies. Why in the faire&s;t tran&s;action of bu&s;ine&s;s is nothing executed without bonds, receipts, and notes of hand? Why does not a perfect con|fidence in the <HI>dignity of human nature</HI> aboli&s;h all the&s;e &s;ecurities? If not between enemies, or people indifferent to each other, yet at lea&s;t between friends and kindred, and the mo&s;t honourable con|nexions? Why, but becau&s;e of that univer&s;al, inborn &s;u&s;picion of man to man; which, from all we &s;ee, and hear, and feel,
<PB N="257" REF="266">is interwoven with our very make? Though we do not entertain any <HI>individual</HI> &s;u&s;picion, nay, though we have the &s;tronge&s;t <HI>per&s;onal</HI> confidence, yet the ac|knowledged principle of conduct has this doctrine for its ba&s;is. <Q>I will take a receipt though it were from my brother,</Q> is the e&s;tabli&s;hed voice of mankind; or as I have heard it more artfully put, by a fallacy of which the very di&s;gui&s;e di&s;covers the principle, <Q>Think every man hone&s;t, but deal with him as if you knew him to be otherwi&s;e.</Q> And as, in a &s;tate of innocence, the bea&s;ts would not have bled for the &s;u&s;tenance of man, &s;o their parchments would not have been wanted as in&s;truments of his &s;ecurity again&s;t his fellow man.</P>
<P>But the grand arguments for this doc|trine mu&s;t be drawn from the Holy Scriptures: and the&s;e, be&s;ides implying it almo&s;t continually, expre&s;sly a&s;&s;ert it; and that in in&s;tances too numerous to be brought forward here. Of the&s;e may I
<PB N="258" REF="267">be allowed to produce a few? <Q>God &s;aw that the wickedne&s;s of man was great, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually:"&mdash; "God looked upon the earth, and behold, it was corrupt; for <HI>all fle&s;h</HI> had corrupted his way upon the earth. And it <HI>repented</HI> the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it <HI>grieved him at his heart</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gene&s;is, vi.</NOTE></Q> This is a picture of mankind <HI>before</HI> the flood; and the portrait does not pre&s;ent more favour|able lineaments after that tremendous judgment had taken place. The P&s;alms abound in lamentations on this depravity. <Q>They are <HI>all</HI> gone a&s;ide; there is <HI>none</HI> that doeth good, no not <HI>one."</HI>&mdash; "In <HI>thy</HI> &s;ight,</Q> &s;ays David, addre&s;&s;ing the Mo&s;t High, "&s;hall <HI>no man living</HI> be ju&s;ti|fied." Job in his u&s;ual lofty &s;train of interrogation, a&s;ks, <Q>What is man that he &s;hould be clean, and he that is
<PB N="259" REF="268">born of a woman that he &s;hould be righteous? Behold the heavens are not clean in <HI>His</HI> &s;ight, how much more abominable and filthy is man, who drinketh iniquity like water?</Q></P>
<P>But the Scriptures do not leave us to draw this as a <HI>con&s;equence;</HI> they <HI>&s;tate</HI> the matter plainly. The wi&s;e man tells us, that<Q>fooli&s;hne&s;s is bound up in the <HI>heart of a child:</HI></Q> the prophet Jeremiah a&s;&s;ures us, <Q>the <HI>heart</HI> is deceitful above all things, and de&s;perately wicked:</Q> and David plainly &s;tates the doctrine: <Q>Behold I was &s;hapen in iniquity, and in &s;in did my mother conceive me.</Q> Can language be more explicit?</P>
<P>The New Te&s;tament corroborates the Old. Our Lord's reproof of Peter &s;eems to take the doctrine for granted: <Q>Thou &s;avoure&s;t not the things that be of God, but tho&s;e that be of <HI>man;</HI></Q> clearly intimating, that the <HI>ways of man</HI> are oppo|&s;ite to the ways of God. And our Saviour, in that affecting di&s;cour&s;e to his di&s;ciples,
<PB N="260" REF="269">tells them plainly that, as they were by his grace made <HI>different</HI> from others, therefore they mu&s;t expect to be hated by tho&s;e who were &s;o unlike them. And it &s;hould be particularly ob&s;erved, that our Lord denominates tho&s;e, upon whom no change of heart had taken place, <HI>"the world."</HI> <Q>If ye were of the world, the world would love its own; but I have cho&s;en you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John, xv. 19.</NOTE></Q> St. John, writing to his Chri&s;tian church, &s;tates the &s;ame truth. <Q>We know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wicked|ne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>Man in his natural &s;tate is likewi&s;e repre&s;ented as in a &s;tate of <HI>guilt,</HI> and under the di&s;plea&s;ure of Almighty God. <Q>He that believeth not the Son &s;hall not &s;ee life; but the wrath of God <HI>abideth</HI> on him.</Q> Evidently implying, that all <HI>naturally</HI> are under the wrath of God.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="270">His natural &s;tate is likewi&s;e de&s;cribed as a <HI>helple&s;s</HI> &s;tate. <Q>The carnal mind is enmity again&s;t God; (awful thought!) for it is not &s;ubject to the law of God, neither indeed <HI>can</HI> be. So then they that are in the fle&s;h <HI>cannot</HI> plea&s;e God.</Q> What the Apo&s;tle means <HI>by being in the fle&s;h</HI> is evident by what follows; for &s;peak|ing of tho&s;e who&s;e hearts were changed by divine grace, he &s;ays, <Q>But ye are <HI>not</HI> in the fle&s;h, but in the &s;pirit, if &s;o be that the Spirit of God dwell in you:</Q> that is, you are now not in your natural &s;tate: the change that has pa&s;&s;ed on your minds by the influence of the Spirit of God is &s;o great, that your &s;tate may pro|perly be called being in the &s;pirit. Yet the &s;ame Apo&s;tle, writing to the churches of Galatia, tells them, that the natural cor|ruption of the human heart is continually oppo&s;ing the &s;pirit of holine&s;s which in|fluences the regenerate. <Q>The fle&s;h lu&s;teth again&s;t the &s;pirit, and the &s;pirit again&s;t the fle&s;h, and the&s;e are contrary
<PB N="262" REF="271">the one to the other.</Q> Which pa&s;&s;age by the way, at the &s;ame time that it proves the corruption of the heart, proves the nece&s;&s;ity of divine influences. And the Apo&s;tle, with re&s;pect to him&s;elf, freely confe&s;&s;es and deeply laments the workings of this corrupt principle. <Q>O wretched man that I am!</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>It has been objected by &s;ome who have oppo&s;ed this doctrine, that the &s;ame Scrip|tures which &s;peak of mankind as being <HI>&s;inners,</HI> &s;peak of &s;ome as being <HI>righteous;</HI> whence they would argue, that though this depravity of human nature may be <HI>general,</HI> yet that it cannot be <HI>univer&s;al.</HI> This objection, when examined, &s;erves only, like all other objections again&s;t the truth, to e&s;tabli&s;h that which it was in|tended to de&s;troy. For what do the Scriptures a&s;&s;ert re&s;pecting the righteous? That there are &s;ome who&s;e principles, views, and conduct, are &s;o different from the re&s;t of the world, and from what theirs them&s;elves once were, that while the latter
<PB N="263" REF="272">are denominated the "&s;ons of men," the former are honoured with the title of the "&s;ons of God." But no where do the Scriptures a&s;&s;ert that they are <HI>&s;inle&s;s;</HI> on the contrary their <HI>faults</HI> are frequently men|tioned; and they are moreover repre|&s;ented as tho&s;e on whom a great <HI>change</HI> has pa&s;t: as having been formerly <Q>dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins:" as "being "<HI>called out</HI> of darkne&s;s into light;" as "<HI>tran&s;lated</HI> into the kingdom of God's dear Son;" as having <HI>pa&s;&s;ed</HI> from death to life.</Q> And St. Paul put this matter pa&s;t all doubt, by expre&s;sly a&s;&s;ert|ing, that <Q><HI>they were all</HI> by nature the children of wrath even as others.</Q></P>
<P>It might be well to a&s;k one who oppo&s;es the doctrine in que&s;tion, and who mu&s;t con&s;equently &s;uppo&s;e that there are <HI>&s;ome</HI> &s;inle&s;s people in the world, how he ex|pects that &s;uch &s;inle&s;s people will be &s;aved (though indeed to talk of an <HI>innocent</HI> per&s;on being <HI>&s;aved</HI> is a palpable contra|diction in terms; it is talking of curing
<PB N="264" REF="273">a man in health.) "Undoubtedly," he will &s;ay, <Q>they will be received into tho&s;e abodes of bli&s;s prepared for the righte|ous.</Q> &mdash;But let him remember there is but <HI>one way</HI> to the&s;e bli&s;sful abodes, and that is, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t: <Q>For there is none other name given among men whereby we mu&s;t be &s;aved.</Q> If we a&s;k who did Chri&s;t come to &s;ave? the Scripture directly an&s;wers, "He came into the world to &s;ave <HI>&s;inners:"</HI>&mdash; <Q>His name was called Je&s;us becau&s;e he came to &s;ave his people <HI>from their &s;ins.</HI></Q> When St. John was favoured with a vi&s;ion of Heaven, he tells us, that he beheld <Q>a great multitude which no man could number, of all nations, and kindred, and people, and tongues, &s;tanding before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes:</Q> that one of the heavenly inhabitants informed him who they were: <Q>The&s;e are they who come out of great tribulation, and have wa&s;hed their robes, and made them
<PB N="265" REF="274">white in the blood of the Lamb; there|fore are they before the throne of God, and &s;erve Him day and night in his Temple; and He that &s;itteth on the throne &s;hall dwell among them; they &s;hall hunger no more, neither thir&s;t any more, neither &s;hall the &s;un light on them, nor any heat; for the Lamb which is in the mid&s;t of them &s;hall feed them, and &s;hall lead them to living fountains of waters, and God &s;hall wipe away all tears from their eyes.</Q></P>
<P>We &s;ee by this de&s;cription what the&s;e glorious and happy beings once were: they were <HI>&s;inful</HI> creatures: their robes were not <HI>&s;potle&s;s:</HI><Q>They had <HI>wa&s;hed</HI> them and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</Q> They were like|wi&s;e once a <HI>&s;uffering</HI> people: they came out of great tribulation. They are de&s;cribed as having overcome the great tempter of mankind, <Q>by the blood of the Lamb <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xii. 14.</NOTE>:" as they who fol|low
<PB N="266" REF="275">the Lamb where&s;over he goeth:</Q> as "redeemed from among men <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xiv. 4.</NOTE>" And their <HI>employment</HI> here de&s;cribed is a farther confirmation of the doctrine of which we are treating. "The great multitude," &amp;c. &amp;c. we are told, <Q>&s;tood and cried with a loud voice, Salvation to our God, who &s;itteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb.</Q> Here we &s;ee they a&s;cribe their &s;alvation to Chri&s;t, and con&s;equently their pre&s;ent happine&s;s to his atoning blood. And in another of their cele&s;tial anthems, they expre&s;sly &s;ay &s;o: <Q>Thou wa&s;t &s;lain, and ha&s;t redeemed us to God by Thy blood, out of every kin|dred, and tongue, and people, and nation <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev. v. 9.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>By all this it is evident, that as men of any other de&s;cription than <HI>redeemed &s;inners</HI> mu&s;t gain admittance to heaven &s;ome other way than that which the Scriptures point out; &s;o when they get thither, their
<PB N="267" REF="276"><HI>employment</HI> will be different, and they mu&s;t have an anthem peculiar to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It is urged that the belief of this doctrine produces many ill effects, and therefore it &s;hould be di&s;couraged. That it does <HI>not</HI> produce tho&s;e ill effects, when not mi&s;|under&s;tood or partially repre&s;ented, we &s;hall attempt to &s;how: at the &s;ame time let it be ob&s;erved, if it be really <HI>true</HI> we mu&s;t not reject it on account of any of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed ill-con&s;equences. Truth may often be attended with di&s;agreeable effects, but if it be truth it mu&s;t &s;till be pur&s;ued. If, for in&s;tance, trea&s;on &s;hould exi&s;t in a country, every one knows the di&s;agreeable effects which will follow &s;uch a conviction; but our <HI>not believing</HI> &s;uch trea&s;on to exi&s;t, will not prevent &s;uch effect following it, on the contrary our believing it may prevent the con&s;equences.</P>
<P>It is objected, that this doctrine deba&s;es human nature, and that finding fault with the building is only another way of finding fault with the architect. To the
<PB N="268" REF="277">fir&s;t part of this objection it may be re|marked, that if man be really a corrupt fallen being, it is proper to repre&s;ent him as &s;uch: the fault then lies in the <HI>man,</HI> and not in the <HI>doctrine,</HI> which only &s;tates the <HI>truth.</HI> As to the inference which is &s;up|po&s;ed to follow, namely, that it throws the fault upon the Creator, it proceeds upon the fal&s;e &s;uppo&s;ition that man's pre&s;ent &s;tate is the &s;tate in which he was originally created: on the contrary the Scriptures a&s;&s;ert, that <Q>God made man upright, but he hath found out many inventions.</Q></P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e objected, that as this doc|trine mu&s;t give us &s;uch a bad opinion of mankind, it mu&s;t, con&s;equently produce ill-will, hatred, and &s;u&s;picion. But it &s;hould be remembered that it gives us no wor&s;e an opinion of mankind than it gives us of our&s;elves; and &s;uch views of our&s;elves have a very &s;alutary effect, in|a&s;much as they have a tendency to pro|duce <HI>humility;</HI> and humility is not likely
<PB N="269" REF="278">to produce ill-will to others, <Q>for only from pride cometh contention:</Q> and as to the views it gives us of mankind, it repre&s;ents us as <HI>fellow &s;ufferers;</HI> and &s;urely the con&s;ideration that we are <HI>companions in mi&s;ery</HI> is not calculated to produce hatred. The truth is, the&s;e effects have actually followed from a fal&s;e and partial view of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Old per&s;ons who have &s;een much of the world, and who, have little religion, are apt to be &s;trong in their belief of man's actual corruption; but not taking it up on Chri&s;tian grounds, this belief in them &s;hows it&s;elf in a narrow and malig|nant temper; in uncharitable judgment and har&s;h opinions.</P>
<P>Su&s;picion and hatred al&s;o are the u&s;es to which Rochefaucault and the other French philo&s;ophers have converted this doctrine: their acute minds intuitively found the corruption of man, and they &s;aw it without its concomitant and cor|recting doctrine: they allowed man to
<PB N="270" REF="279">be a depraved creature, but di&s;allowed his high original: they found him in a low &s;tate but did not conceive of him as hav|ing fallen from a better. They repre&s;ent him rather as a brute than an apo&s;tate; not taking into the account that his pre|&s;ent degraded nature and depraved facul|ties are not his original &s;tate: that he is not &s;uch as he came out of the hands of his Creator, but &s;uch as he made him&s;elf by &s;in. Nor do they know that he has not even now lo&s;t all remains of his pri|mitive dignity, but is &s;till capable of a re&s;toration more glorious Than is dreamt of in their Philo&s;ophy. Perhaps, too, they know from what they <HI>feel,</HI> all the <HI>evil</HI> to which man is inclined; but they do not know, for they have not felt, all the good of which he is capa|ble by the &s;uperinduction of the divine principle: thus they a&s;per&s;e human nature in&s;tead of fairly repre&s;enting it, and in &s;o
<PB N="271" REF="280">doing it is <HI>they</HI> who calumniate the great Creator.</P>
<P>The doctrine of corruption is likewi&s;e accu&s;ed of being a gloomy, di&s;couraging doctrine, and an enemy to joy and com|fort. Now &s;uppo&s;e this objection true in its fulle&s;t extent. Is it any way unrea&s;on|able that a being fallen into a &s;tate of &s;in, under the di&s;plea&s;ure of Almighty God, &s;hould feel <HI>&s;eriou&s;ly alarmed</HI> at being in &s;uch a &s;tate? Is the condemned criminal blamed becau&s;e he is not <HI>merry?</HI> And would it be e&s;teemed a kind action to per|&s;uade him that he is <HI>not</HI> condemned in order to make him &s;o?</P>
<P>But this charge is <HI>not</HI> true in the &s;en&s;e intended by tho&s;e who bring it forward. Tho&s;e who believe this doctrine are <HI>not</HI> the mo&s;t gloomy people. When, indeed, any one by the influence of the Holy Spirit is brought to view his &s;tate as it really is, a &s;tate of guilt and danger, it is natural that <HI>fear</HI> &s;hould be excited in his mind, but it is &s;uch a fear as impels
<PB N="272" REF="281">him "to flee from the wrath to come:" It is &s;uch a fear as moved Noah to <Q>pre|pare an ark to the &s;aving of his hou&s;e.</Q> Such an one will likewi&s;e feel <HI>&s;orrow,</HI> but not <Q>the &s;orrow of the world which worketh death,</Q> but that godly &s;orrow which worketh repentance: &s;uch an one is in a proper &s;tate to receive the glorious doctrine we are next about to contem|plate; namely, THAT GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD, THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON, THAT WHOSOEVER BELIEVED ON HIM SHOULD NOT PERISH BUT HAVE EVERLASTING LIFE.</P>
<P>Of this doctrine it is of the la&s;t import|ance to form ju&s;t views, for as it is the only doctrine which can keep the humble penitent from de&s;pair, &s;o, on the other hand, great care mu&s;t be taken that fal&s;e views of it do not lead us to pre&s;umption. In order to under&s;tand it rightly, we mu&s;t
<PB N="273" REF="282">not fill our minds with our own rea&s;on|ings upon it, which has mi&s;led &s;ome good people, but we mu&s;t betake our&s;elves to the &s;criptures, wherein we &s;hall find it &s;o plainly &s;tated that the mi&s;takes have not ari&s;en from a want of clearne&s;s in the &s;criptures, but from a de&s;ire to make it bend to &s;ome favorite notions. By this mode of proceeding it has been rejected by &s;ome, and &s;o mutilated by others, as hardly to retain any re&s;emblance to the &s;cripture doctrine of redemption. We are told in the beautiful pa&s;&s;age la&s;t quoted, its &s;ource, &mdash;the love of God to a lo&s;t world:&mdash;<HI>who</HI> the Redeemer was&mdash;the Son of God:&mdash;the <HI>end</HI> for which this plan was formed and executed, &mdash; <Q>That who|&s;oever believed in him &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life:</Q> there is nothing &s;urely in all this to promote gloomine&s;s. If kindne&s;s and mercy have a tendency to win and warm the heart, here is every incentive to joy and cheer|fulne&s;s. Chri&s;tianity looks kindly upon
<PB N="274" REF="283">all, and with peculiar tenderne&s;s on &s;uch, as, from humbling views of their own un|worthine&s;s, might be led to fancy them|&s;elves excluded:&mdash;we are expre&s;sly told that "Chri&s;t died for <HI>all:"</HI>&mdash;that <Q>he ta&s;ted death for <HI>every</HI> man:"&mdash;that "he died for the &s;ins of the <HI>whole world.</HI></Q> Accordingly he has commanded that his Go&s;pel &s;hould be <Q>preached to <HI>every creature;</HI></Q> which is in effect declaring that not a &s;ingle human being is excluded: &mdash;for to preach the Go&s;pel is to offer a Saviour:&mdash;and the Saviour in the plaine&s;t language offers him&s;elf to all, &mdash;declaring to "all the ends of the earth"&mdash; <Q>look unto me and be &s;aved.</Q> It is there|fore an undeniable truth that no one will peri&s;h for <HI>want</HI> of a Saviour, but for <HI>rejecting</HI> him.</P>
<P>But to &s;uppo&s;e that becau&s;e Chri&s;t has <HI>died</HI> for the "&s;ins of the whole world:" the whole world will therefore be <HI>&s;aved</HI> is a mo&s;t fatal mi&s;take: the &s;ame book which tells us that "Chri&s;t died for all," tells us likewi&s;e the awful truth that but
<PB N="275" REF="284">"<HI>few</HI> will be &s;aved!" And whil&s;t it de|clares that <Q>there is no other name whereby we may be &s;aved, but the name of Je&s;us;</Q> it likewi&s;e declares THAT <Q>WITHOUT HOLINESS NO MAN SHALL SEE THE LORD.</Q></P>
<P>It is much to be feared that &s;ome, in their zeal to defend the Go&s;pel doctrines of free grace have materially injured the Go&s;pel doctrine of holine&s;s:&mdash;&s;tating that Chri&s;t has done all in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e as that there is nothing left for us to do.&mdash;But do the Scriptures hold out this language? &mdash;"Come, for all things are ready" is the Go&s;pel call, in which we may ob&s;erve that at the &s;ame time that it tells us that "all things are ready," it neverthele&s;s tells us that we mu&s;t <HI>"come."</HI> Food be|ing <HI>provided</HI> for us will not benefit us except we <HI>partake</HI> of it.&mdash;It will not avail us that <Q>Chri&s;t our pa&s;&s;over is <HI>&s;acrificed</HI>

<P>It is the more nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;i&s;t on this in the pre&s;ent day, as there is a worldly and fa&s;hionable, as well as a low and &s;ec|tarian Antinomiani&s;m. An unwarranted a&s;&s;urance of Salvation founded on a &s;light, vague, and general confidence in what Chri&s;t has done and &s;uffered for us, as if the great object of his doing and &s;uffering had been to emancipate us from all duty and obedience; and that becau&s;e he died for &s;inners, we might therefore &s;afely and comfortably go on to live in &s;in, content|ing our&s;elves with now and then a tran|&s;ient, formal, and unmeaning avowal of
<PB N="277" REF="286">our unworthine&s;s, our obligation, and the all-&s;ufficiency of <HI>his</HI> atonement. By this quit-rent, of which all the co&s;t con&s;i&s;ts in the acknowledgment, the &s;en&s;ual, the worldly and the vain &s;hall find a refuge in heaven when driven from the enjoy|ments of this world. But this indolent Chri&s;tianity is no where taught in the Bible. The faith inculcated <HI>there</HI> is not a lazy, pro|fe&s;&s;ional faith, but that &s;aith which "pro|duceth <HI>obedience,"</HI> that faith which "worketh by love," that faith of which the practical language is:&mdash; <Q><HI>Strive</HI> that you may enter in;</Q>&mdash; <Q>So <HI>run</HI> that you may obtain;</Q>&mdash; <Q>So <HI>fight</HI> that you may lay hold on eternal life.</Q>&mdash;That faith which directs us <Q>not to be weary in well-doing;"&mdash;which &s;ays, <HI>Work</HI> out your own Salvation;</Q>&mdash; Never forgetting at the &s;ame time <Q>that it is God which worketh in us both to will and to do.</Q>&mdash;Are tho&s;e rich &s;upplies of grace which the Go&s;pel offers;
<PB N="278" REF="287">are tho&s;e abundant aids of the &s;pirit which it promi&s;es, tendered to the <HI>&s;lothful?</HI>&mdash;No. &mdash;God will have all his gifts improved. Grace mu&s;t be u&s;ed, or it will be with|drawn. Nor does the Almighty think it derogatory to his free grace to declare that <Q>tho&s;e only who do his command|ments have right to the tree of life.</Q> Nor do the Scriptures repre&s;ent it as de|rogatory to the <HI>&s;acrifice</HI> of Chri&s;t to follow his <HI>example</HI> in well-doing. The only cau|tion is that we mu&s;t not work in our own &s;trength, nor bring in our contribution of works as if in aid of the &s;uppo&s;ed defi|ciency of His merits.</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t not in our <HI>over-caution</HI> fancy that becau&s;e Chri&s;t has <Q>redeemed us from the cur&s;e of the law,</Q> that we are therefore without a law. In acknow|ledging Chri&s;t as a deliverer we mu&s;t not forget that he is a lawgiver too, and that we are expre&s;sly commanded to fulfil the law of Chri&s;t: if we wi&s;h to know what
<PB N="279" REF="288">his laws are, we mu&s;t <Q>&s;earch the Scrip|tures,</Q> e&s;pecially the New Te&s;tament, there we &s;hall find him declaring THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF A CHANGE OF HEART AND LIFE; That <Q>except a man be born again he cannot &s;ee the kingdom of God.</Q> That it is not a mere acknowledging His authority, calling him "Lord, Lord," that will avail any thing, except we DO what He commands: that any thing &s;hort of this is like a man building his hou&s;e upon the &s;ands, which, when the &s;torms come on, will certainly fall. In like manner the Apo&s;tles are continually en|forcing the nece&s;&s;ity of this change, which they de&s;cribe under the various names of <Q>the new man <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ephe&s;ians, iv. 24.</NOTE>;"&mdash;"the new crea|ture <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Galatians, vi. 15.</NOTE>;"&mdash;"a transformation into the
<PB N="280" REF="289">image of God <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Corinthians, xii.</NOTE>;"&mdash;"a participation of the divine nature <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Peter, i. 4.</NOTE>.</Q> Nor is this change repre&s;ented as con&s;i&s;ting merely in a change of religious opinions; nor in exchanging gro&s;s &s;ins for tho&s;e which are more &s;ober and reputable; nor in re|nouncing the &s;ins of youth, and a&s;&s;uming tho&s;e of a quieter period of life; nor in leaving off evil practices becau&s;e men are grown tired of them, or find they injure their credit, health, or fortune; nor does it con&s;i&s;t in inoffen&s;ivene&s;s and obliging manners, nor indeed in any <HI>outward</HI> re|formation.</P>
<P>But the change con&s;i&s;ts in <Q>being renewed in the &s;pirit of our minds;</Q> in being <Q>conformed to the image of the Son of God;" in being "called out of darkne&s;s into His marvellous light.</Q> And the whole of this great change, its beginning, progre&s;s, and final accompli&s;h|ment,
<PB N="281" REF="290">for it is repre&s;ented as a gradual change&mdash;is a&s;cribed to THE INFLUENCES OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.</P>
<P>We are perpetually reminded of our utter inability to help our&s;elves, that we may &s;et the higher value on tho&s;e gracious aids which are held out to us. We are told that <Q>we are not &s;ufficient to <HI>think</HI> any thing as of our&s;elves, but our &s;ufficiency is of God.</Q> And when we are told that <Q>if we live after the fle&s;h we &s;hall die,</Q> we are at the &s;ame time re|minded, that it is <Q>through the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> that we mu&s;t mortify the deeds of the body.</Q> We are likewi&s;e cautioned that we <Q>grieve not the Holy Spirit of God:</Q> that we "quench not the Spirit." On the con|trary, we are exhorted to <Q>&s;tir up the gift of God which is in us.</Q> By all which expre&s;&s;ions, and many others of like import, we are taught that while we are to a&s;cribe with humble gratitude every good
<PB N="282" REF="291">thought, word, and work, to the influence of the Holy Spirit; we are not to look on &s;uch influences as &s;uper&s;eding our own exertions: for it is too plain that we <HI>may</HI> reject the gracious offers of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, otherwi&s;e there would be no occa&s;ion to caution us <HI>not</HI> to do it. Our Lord him&s;elf has illu&s;trated this in the mo&s;t conde&s;cending and endearing manner: "Behold," &s;ays he, <Q>I &s;tand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will &s;up with him, and he with me.</Q> Ob&s;erve, it is not &s;aid if any man will not li&s;ten to me, I will force open the door. But if we refu&s;e admit|tance to &s;uch a gue&s;t, we mu&s;t abide by the con&s;equences.</P>
<P>This &s;ublime doctrine of divine a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance is the more to be prized, not only on account of our own helple&s;&s;ne&s;s, but from the additional con&s;ideration of the power|ful adver&s;ary with whom the Chri&s;tian has to contend. An article of our faith by the
<PB N="283" REF="292">way, which is growing into general di&s;|repute among the politer cla&s;&s;es of &s;o|ciety. Nay, there is a kind of ridicule attached to the very &s;ugge&s;tion of the &s;ubject as if it were exploded on full proof of its being an ab&s;olute ab&s;urdity, utterly repugnant to the liberal &s;pirit of an en|lightened age. And it requires no &s;mall neatne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion and periphra&s;tic ingenuity to get the very mention tole|rated. &mdash;<HI>I mean the Scripture doctrine of the exi&s;tence and power of our great &s;piritual enemy.</HI> It is con&s;idered by the fa&s;hionable &s;ceptic as a vulgar invention which ought to be bani&s;hed with the belief in dreams and witchcraft:&mdash;by the fa&s;hionable Chri&s;tian as an ingenious allegory, but not as a literal truth; and by almo&s;t all as a doctrine which when it happens to be in|troduced at Church has at lea&s;t nothing to do with the <HI>pews,</HI> but is by common con|&s;ent made over to the <HI>ai&s;les,</HI> if indeed it mu&s;t be retained at all.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="293">May I, with great humility and re&s;pect, pre&s;ume to &s;ugge&s;t to our divines that they would do well not to lend their countenance to the&s;e modi&s;h curtailments of the Chri&s;t|ian faith; nor to &s;hun the introduction of this doctrine when it con&s;i&s;ts with their &s;ubject to bring it forward. A truth which is &s;eldom brought before the eye imperceptibly grows le&s;s and le&s;s im|portant; and if it be an unplea&s;ing truth, we grow more and more reconciled to its ab&s;ence, till at length its intru&s;ion becomes offen&s;ive, and we learn in the end to renounce what we at fir&s;t only neglected. Becau&s;e &s;ome coar&s;e and ranting enthu|fia&s;ts have been fond of u&s;ing tremendous terms with a violence and frequency, as if it were a gratification to them to denounce judgments, and anticipate torments, can <HI>their</HI> coar&s;ene&s;s or vulgarity make a true doctrine fal&s;e, or an important one trifling? If &s;uch preachers have given offence by their uncouth manner of handling an
<PB N="285" REF="294">awful doctrine, that indeed furni&s;hes a cau|tion for treating the &s;ubject more di&s;creetly, but it is no ju&s;t rea&s;on for avoiding the doctrine. For to keep a truth out of &s;ight becau&s;e it has been ab&s;urdly treated or ill defended, might in time be a&s;&s;igned as a rea&s;on for keeping back, one by one, every doctrine of our holy Church; for which of them has not had imprudent advocates or weak champions?</P>
<P>Be it remembered that the doctrine in que&s;tion is not only interwoven by allu&s;ion, implication, or direct a&s;&s;ertion throughout the whole Scripture, but that it &s;tands prominently per&s;oni&s;ied at the opening of the New as well as the Old Te&s;tament. The devil's temptation of our Lord, in which he is not repre&s;ented &s;iguratively, but vi&s;ibly and palpably, &s;tands on the &s;ame ground of authority with other events which are received without repug|nance. And it may not be an unu&s;eful ob&s;ervation to remark, that the very re|fu&s;ing to believe in an evil &s;pirit, is one of
<PB N="286" REF="295">his own &s;ugge&s;tions; for there is not a more dangerous illu&s;ion than to believe our&s;elves out of the reach of illu&s;ions, nor a more alarming temptation than to fancy that we are not liable to be tempted.</P>
<P>But the dark cloud rai&s;ed by this doc|trine will be di&s;pelled by the cheering certainty that our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour having him&s;elf <Q>been tempted like as we are, is able to deliver tho&s;e who are tempted.</Q></P>
<P>But to return.&mdash;From this imperfect &s;ketch we may &s;ee how &s;uitable the religion of Chri&s;t is to fallen man! How exactly it meets every want! No one needs now peri&s;h becau&s;e he is a &s;inner, provided he be willing to for&s;ake his &s;ins; for <Q>Je&s;us Chri&s;t came into the world to &s;ave &s;inners:" and "He is now exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance and forgivene&s;s of &s;in.</Q> Which pa&s;&s;age, be it ob&s;erved, points out to us the <HI>order</HI> in which he be&s;tows his ble&s;&s;ings; he fir&s;t gives <HI>repentance,</HI> and then <HI>forgivene&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="296">We may likewi&s;e &s;ee how much the character of a true Chri&s;tian ri&s;es above every other: that there is a wholene&s;s, an integrity, a completene&s;s in the Chri&s;t|ian character: that a few natural, plea&s;ing qualities, not ca&s;t in the mould of the Go&s;pel, are but as beautiful fragments, or well-turned &s;ingle limbs, which for want of that beauty which ari&s;es from the proportion of parts; for want of that connec|tion of the members with the living head are of little comparative excellence. There may be amiable qualities which are not Chri&s;t|ian graces: and the Apo&s;tle after enume|rating every &s;eparate article of attack or defence with which a Chri&s;tian warrior is to be accoutered, &s;ums up the matter by directing that we put on <Q>the <HI>whole</HI> armour of God.</Q> And this <HI>complete|ne&s;s</HI> is in&s;i&s;ted on by all the Apo&s;tles. One prays that his converts may <Q>&s;tand <HI>perfect</HI> and <HI>complete</HI> in the whole will of God:</Q> another enjoins that they be "<HI>perfect</HI> and <HI>entire</HI> wanting nothing."</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="297">Now we are not to &s;uppo&s;e that they expected any convert to be <HI>without faults;</HI> they knew too well the con&s;titution of the human heart; but Chri&s;tians mu&s;t have no fault in their <HI>principle;</HI> their <HI>views</HI> mu&s;t be direct, their <HI>&s;cheme</HI> mu&s;t be fault|le&s;s; their <HI>intention</HI> mu&s;t be &s;ingle; their <HI>&s;tandard</HI> mu&s;t be lofty; their <HI>object</HI> mu&s;t be right: their <Q><HI>mark</HI> mu&s;t be the high calling of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</Q>&mdash; There mu&s;t be no <HI>allowed</HI> evil, no <HI>war|ranted</HI> defection, no <HI>tolerated</HI> impurity. Though they do not ri&s;e as high as they ought, nor as they wi&s;h, in the &s;cale of perfection, yet the &s;cale it&s;elf mu&s;t be correct, and the de&s;ire of a&s;cending per|petual, counting the degrees they have already attained as nothing. Every grace mu&s;t be kept in exerci&s;e, conque&s;ts once made over any evil propen&s;ity mu&s;t not only be maintained but extended. And in truth, Chri&s;tianity &s;o compri&s;es con|trary, and as it may be thought irrecon|cileable excellences, that tho&s;e which &s;eem
<PB N="289" REF="298">&s;o incompatible as to be incapable by nature of being immates of the &s;ame brea&s;t, are almo&s;t nece&s;&s;arily involved in the Chri&s;tian character.</P>
<P>For in&s;tance; Chri&s;tianity requires that our faith be at once fervent and &s;ober; that our love be both ardent and la&s;ting; that our patience be not only heroic but gentle: &s;he demands dauntle&s;s zeal and ge|nuine humility; active &s;ervices and complete &s;elf-renunciation; high attainments in good|ne&s;s, with deep con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of defect; courage in reproving, and meekne&s;s in bear|ing reproof; a quick perception of what is &s;inful, with a willingne&s;s to forgive the offender; active virtue ready to <HI>do</HI> all, and pa&s;&s;ive virtue ready to <HI>bear</HI> all.&mdash;We mu&s;t &s;tretch every faculty in the &s;ervice of our Lord, and yet bring every thought into obedience to Him: while we aim to live in the exerci&s;e of every Chri&s;tian grace, we mu&s;t account our&s;elves unpro|fitable &s;ervants: we mu&s;t <HI>&s;trive</HI> for the crown, yet receive it as a <HI>gift,</HI> and then
<PB N="290" REF="299">lay it at our Ma&s;ter's feet: while we are bu&s;ily trading in the world with our Lord's talents, we mu&s;t <Q>commune with our heart, and be &s;till:</Q> while we &s;trive to practice the pure&s;t di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, we mu&s;t be contented to meet with &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s in return; and while we &s;hould be laying out our lives for the good of mankind, we mu&s;t &s;ubmit to reproach without mur|muring, and to ingratitude without re&s;ent|ment. And to render us equal to all the&s;e &s;ervices, Chri&s;tianity be&s;tows not only the precept, but the power: &s;he does what the great poet of Ethics lamented that Rea&s;on could not do, <Q>&s;he lends us arms as well as rules.</Q></P>
<P>For here, if not only the worldly and the timid, but the humble and the well|di&s;po&s;ed &s;hould demand with fear and trembling, <Q>Who is &s;ufficient for the&s;e things?</Q> Revelation makes its own reviving an&s;wer: <Q>My grace is &s;ufficient for thee.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="300">But it will be well to di&s;tingui&s;h that there are two &s;orts of Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ors, one of which affect to &s;peak of Chri&s;t|ianity as if it were a mere &s;y&s;tem of doc|trines, with little reference to their influ|ence on life and manners; while the other con&s;ider it as exhibiting a &s;cheme of human duties independent on its doctrines. For though the latter &s;ort may admit the doctrines, yet they contemplate them as a &s;eparate and di&s;connected &s;et of opinions, rather than as an influential principle of action.&mdash;In violation of that beautiful harmony which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in every part of Scripture between practice and belief, the religious world furni&s;hes two &s;orts of people, who &s;eem to enli&s;t them&s;elves, as if in oppo&s;ition, under the banners of Saint Paul and Saint James, as if tho&s;e two great champions of the Chri&s;tian cau&s;e had fought for two ma&s;ters. Tho&s;e who affect re&s;pectively to be the di&s;ciples of each, treat faith and works as if they were oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts, in&s;tead of in|&s;eparable
<PB N="292" REF="301">points. Nay, they go farther, and &s;et Saint Paul at variance with him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Now in&s;tead of rea&s;oning on the point, let us refer to the Apo&s;tle in que&s;tion, who definitively &s;ettles the di&s;pute. The Apo&s;to|lical order and method in this re&s;pect de&s;erve notice and imitation; for it is ob&s;ervable that the earlier parts of mo&s;t of the Epi&s;tles abcund in the <HI>doctrines</HI> of Chri&s;tianity, while tho&s;e latter chapters, which wind up the &s;ubject, exhibit all the <HI>duties</HI> which grow out of them, as the natural and nece&s;&s;ary productions of &s;uch a living root. But this alternate mention of doctrine and practice, which &s;eemed likely to <HI>unite,</HI> has on the contrary formed a &s;ort of line of &s;eparation between the&s;e two orders of believers, and introduced a broken and mutilated &s;y&s;tem. Tho&s;e who would make Chri&s;tianity con&s;i&s;t of doctrines only, dwell, for in&s;tance, on the fir&s;t eleven chapters of the Epi&s;tle to the Romans, as containing exclu&s;ively the
<PB N="293" REF="302">&s;um and &s;ub&s;tance of the Go&s;pel. While the mere morali&s;ts, who wi&s;h to &s;trip Chri&s;t|ianity of her lofty and appropriate attri|butes, delight to dwell on the <HI>twelfth</HI> chapter, which is a table of duties, as exclu&s;ively as if the preceding chapters made no part of Scripture. But Paul him&s;elf, who was at lea&s;t as &s;ound a theologian as any of his commentators, &s;ettles the matter another way, by making the duties of the twelfth grow out of the doctrines of the antecedent <HI>eleven,</HI> ju&s;t as any other con&s;equence grows out of its cau&s;e. And as if he &s;u&s;pected that the indivi&s;ible union between them might po&s;&s;ibly be overlooked, he links the two di&s;tinct divi&s;ions together by a logical "therefore," with which the twelfth begins:&mdash;"I be&s;eech you <HI>therefore,"</HI> (that is, as the effect of all I have been inculcat|ing,) <Q>that you pre&s;ent your bodies a living &s;acrifice, acceptable to God,</Q> &amp;c. and then goes on to enforce on them, as a con&s;equence of what he had been preach|ing,
<PB N="294" REF="303">the practice of every Chri&s;tian virtue. This combined view of the &s;ubject &s;eems, on the one hand, to be the only means of preventing the &s;ub&s;titution of Pagan morality for Chri&s;tian holine&s;s; and on the other, of &s;ecuring the leading doctrine of ju&s;tification by faith, from the dreadful dangers of Antinomian licentiou&s;ne&s;s; every human obligation being thus grafted on the living &s;tock of a divine principle.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX. <HI>On the duty and efficacy of prayer.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is not propo&s;ed to enter largely on a topic which has been exhau&s;ted by the able&s;t pens. But as a work of this nature &s;eems to require that &s;o important a &s;ubject &s;huld not be overlooked, it is intended to notice in a &s;light manner of a few of tho&s;e many difficulties and popular objections which are brought forward again&s;t the u&s;e and efficacy of prayer, even by tho&s;e who would be unwilling to be &s;u&s;pected of impiety and unbelief.</P>
<P>There is a cla&s;s of objectors who &s;trangely profe&s;s to withhold homage from the Mo&s;t High, not out of contempt, but reverence. They affect to con&s;ider the u&s;e of prayer as derogatory to the omni&s;cience of God, becau&s;e it looks as
<PB N="296" REF="305">if we thought he &s;tood in need of being informed of our wants; and as derogatory to his goodne&s;s, as implying that he needs to be put in mind of them.</P>
<P>But is it not enough for &s;uch poor frail beings as we are to know, that God him&s;elf does not con&s;ider prayer as de|rogatory either to his wi&s;dom or good|ne&s;s? And &s;hall <HI>we</HI> erect our&s;elves into judges of what is con&s;i&s;tent with the attributes of HIM before whom angels fall pro&s;trate with &s;elf-aba&s;ement? Will he thank &s;uch defenders of his attributes, who, while they profe&s;s to reverence, &s;cruple not to di&s;obey him? It ought rather to be viewed as a great encourage|ment to prayer, that we are addre&s;&s;ing a Being, who knows our wants better than we can expre&s;s them, and who&s;e prevent|ing goodne&s;s is always ready to relieve them.</P>
<P>It is objected by another cla&s;s, and on the &s;pecious ground of humility too, though we do not always find the objector
<PB N="297" REF="306">him&s;elf quite as humble as his plea, that it is arrogant in &s;uch in&s;ignificant beings as we are to pre&s;ume to lay our petty nece&s;&s;ities before the Great and Glorious God, who cannot be expected to con|de&s;cend to the multitude of tri&s;ling and even interfering reque&s;ts which are brought before him by his creatures. The&s;e and &s;uch like objections ari&s;e from mean and unworthy thoughts of the Great Creator. It &s;eems as if tho&s;e who make them con|&s;idered the Mo&s;t High as <Q>&s;uch an one as them&s;elves;</Q> a Being, who can perform a certain quantity of bu&s;ine&s;s, but who would be overpowered with an additional quantity. Or at be&s;t, is it not con&s;idering the Almighty in the light, not of an infinite God, but of a great man, of a king, or a mini&s;ter, who, while he &s;uperintends great and national concerns, is obliged to neglect &s;mall and individual petitions, be|cau&s;e he cannot &s;pare that lei&s;ure and attention which &s;uffice for every thing? They do not con&s;ider him as that infinitely
<PB N="298" REF="307">glorious Being who, while he beholds at once all that is doing in heaven and in earth, is at the &s;ame time as attentive to the prayer of the poor de&s;titute, as pre&s;ent to the &s;orrowful &s;ighing of the pri&s;oner, as if the&s;e forlorn creatures were the objects of his undivided attention.</P>
<P>The&s;e critics, who are for &s;paring the Supreme Being the trouble of our prayers, and would relieve Omnipotence of part of his burden, by a&s;&s;igning to his care only &s;uch a portion as may be more ea&s;ily managed, if I may &s;o &s;peak without pro|fanene&s;s, &s;eem to have no conception of his attributes.</P>
<P>They forget that infinite wi&s;dom puts him as ea&s;ily within reach of all know|ledge, as infinite power does of all per|formance: that he is a Being in who&s;e plans complexity makes no difficulty, and multiplicity no confu&s;ion: that to ubi|quity di&s;tance does not exi&s;t; that to infinity &s;pace is annihilated: that pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and future, are di&s;cerned more
<PB N="299" REF="308">accurately at one glance of his eye, to whom a thou&s;and years are as one day, than a &s;ingle moment of time or a &s;ingle point of &s;pace can be by ours.</P>
<P>To the other part of the objection founded on the &s;uppo&s;ed interference (that is, irreconcileablene&s;s) of one man's petitions with tho&s;e of another, this an&s;wer &s;eems to &s;ugge&s;t it&s;elf: fir&s;t, that we mu&s;t take care that when we a&s;k, we do not "a&s;k ami&s;s;" that, for in&s;tance, we a&s;k chiefly, and in an unqualified manner, only for &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings to our&s;elves and others; and in doing this the prayer of one man <HI>cannot</HI> interfere with that of another. Next, in a&s;king for temporal and inferior ble&s;&s;ings, we mu&s;t <HI>qualify</HI> our petition even though it &s;hould extend to deliverance from the &s;evere&s;t pains, or to our very life it&s;elf, according to that ex|ample of our Saviour: <Q>Father, <HI>if it be po&s;&s;ible,</HI> let this cup pa&s;s from me. <HI>Never|thele&s;s, not my will,</HI> but thine, be done.</Q> By thus qualifying our prayer, we exer|ci&s;e
<PB N="300" REF="309">our&s;elves in an act of re&s;ignation to God; we profe&s;s not to wi&s;h what will interfere with his benevolent plan, and yet we may hope by prayer to &s;ecure the ble&s;&s;ing &s;o far as it is con&s;i&s;tent with it. Perhaps the rea&s;on why this objection to prayer is &s;o &s;trongly felt, is the too great di&s;po&s;ition to pray for merely temporal and worldly ble&s;&s;ings, and to de&s;ire them in the mo&s;t unqualified manner, not &s;ub|mitting to be without them, even though the granting them &s;hould be incon&s;i&s;tent with the general plan of Providence.</P>
<P>Another cla&s;s continue to bring for|ward, as pertinatiou&s;ly as if it had never been an&s;wered, the exhau&s;ted argument, that &s;eeing God is immutable, no petitions of ours can ever change Him: that events them&s;elves being &s;ettled in a fixed and unalterable cour&s;e, and bound in a fatal nece&s;&s;ity, it is folly to think that we can di&s;turb the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of the univer&s;e, or interrupt the cour&s;e of Providence by our prayers: and that it is ab&s;urd to &s;up|po&s;e
<PB N="301" REF="310">the&s;e firm decrees can be rever&s;ed by any reque&s;ts of ours.</P>
<P>Without entering into the wide and trackle&s;s field of fate and free will, from which pur&s;uit I am kept back equally by the mo&s;t profound ignorance and the mo&s;t invincible di&s;like, I would only ob|&s;erve, that the&s;e objections apply equally to all human actions as well as to prayer. It may therefore with the &s;ame propriety be urged, that &s;eeing God is immutable and his decrees unalterable, therefore our <HI>actions</HI> can produce no change in Him or in our own &s;tate. Weak as well as im|pious rea&s;oning! It may be que&s;tioned whether the modern French and German philo&s;ophers might not be prevailed upon to acknowledge the exi&s;tence of God, if they might make &s;uch a u&s;e of his attri|butes. The truth is, and it is a truth di&s;|coverable without any depth of learning, all the&s;e objections are the offspring of <HI>pride.</HI> Poor, &s;hort-&s;ighted men cannot reconcile the omni&s;cience and decrees of
<PB N="302" REF="311">God with the efficacy of prayer; and, becau&s;e <HI>he</HI> cannot reconcile them, he mode&s;tly concludes they are irreconcileable. How much more wi&s;dom as well as hap|pine&s;s re&s;ults from an humble chri&s;tian &s;pirit! Such a plain practical text as, <Q>Draw near unto God, and he will draw near unto you,</Q> carries more con&s;o|lation, more true knowledge of his wants and their remedy to the heart of a peni|tent &s;inner, than all the <HI>tomes</HI> of ca&s;ui&s;try which have puzzled the world ever &s;ince the que&s;tion was fir&s;t &s;et afloat by its ori|ginal propounders.</P>
<P>And as the plain man only got up and walked, to prove there was &s;uch a thing as motion, in an&s;wer to the phi|lo&s;opher who denied it; &s;o the plain Chri&s;tian, when he is borne down with the a&s;&s;urance that there is no efficacy in prayer, requires no better argument to repel the a&s;&s;ertion than the good he finds in prayer it&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="312">All the doubts propo&s;ed to him re&s;pect|ing God do not &s;o much affect him as this one doubt re&s;pecting him&s;elf: <Q>If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.</Q> For the chief doubt and difficulty of a Chri&s;tian con&s;i&s;ts, not &s;o much in a di&s;tru&s;t of God's ability and willingne&s;s to an&s;wer the prayer of the upright, as in a di&s;tru&s;t of his own upright|ne&s;s, and in the quality of the prayer which he offers up.</P>
<P>Let the &s;ubjects of a dark fate maintain a &s;ullen, or the &s;laves of a blind chance a hopele&s;s &s;ilence, but let the child of a compa&s;&s;ionate Almighty Father &s;upplicate his mercies with an humble confidence, in&s;pired by the a&s;&s;urance, that <Q>the very hairs of his head are numbered.</Q> Let him take comfort in that individual and minute attention, without which not a &s;parrow falls to the ground, as well as in that cheering promi&s;e, that, as <Q>His eyes are over the righteous," &s;o are "his ears open to their prayers.</Q> And as
<PB N="304" REF="313">a pious Bi&s;hop has ob&s;erved, <Q>Our Saviour has as it were hedged in and inclo&s;ed the Lord's Prayer with the&s;e two great fences of our faith, God's <HI>willingne&s;s</HI> and his <HI>power</HI> to help us:</Q> the pre|face to it a&s;&s;ures us of the one, which, by calling God by the tender name of "Our Father," intimates his <HI>readine&s;s</HI> to help his children: and the animating conclu&s;ion, "Thine is the <HI>Power,"</HI> re&s;cues us from every unbelieving doubt of his <HI>ability</HI> to help us.</P>
<P>A Chri&s;tian knows, becau&s;e he feels, that prayer is, though in a way to him in&s;crutable, the medium of connection between God and his rational creatures; the means appointed by him to draw down his ble&s;&s;ings upon us. The Chri&s;tian knows, that prayer is the appointed means of uniting two ideas, one of the highe&s;t magnificence, the other of the mo&s;t pro|found lowline&s;s, within the compa&s;s of imagination; namely, that it is the link of communication between <Q>the High and
<PB N="305" REF="314">Lofty One who inhabiteth eternity,</Q> and that heart of the <Q>contrite in which he de|lights to dwell.</Q> He knows that this inex|plicable union between Beings &s;o un&s;peak|ably, &s;o e&s;&s;entially different, can only be maintained by prayer.</P>
<P>The plain Chri&s;tian, as was before ob|&s;erved, cannot explain why it is &s;o; but while he <HI>feels</HI> the efficacy, he is contented to let the learned <HI>define</HI> it; and he will no more po&s;tpone prayer till he can produce a chain of rea&s;oning on the man|ner in which he derives benefit from it, than he will po&s;tpone eating till he can give a &s;cientific lecture on the nature of dige&s;tion: he is contented with knowing that his meat has nouri&s;hed him; and he leaves to the philo&s;opher, who may choo&s;e to defer his meal till he has elaborated his treati&s;e, to &s;tarve in the interim. The Chri&s;tian feels better than he is able to explain, that the functions of his &s;piritual life can no more be carried on without habitual prayer, than tho&s;e of his natural
<PB N="306" REF="315">life without frequent bodily nouri&s;hment. He feels renovation and &s;trength grow out of the u&s;e of the appointed means, as nece&s;&s;arily in the one ca&s;e as in the other. He feels that the health of his &s;oul can no more be &s;u&s;tained, and its powers kept in continued vigour by the <HI>prayers</HI> of a di&s;|tant day, than his body by the <HI>aliment</HI> of a di&s;tant day.</P>
<P>But there is one motive to the duty in que&s;tion, far more con&s;training to the true believer than all others that can be named; more imperious than any argu|ments on its utility, than any convictions of its efficacy, even than any experience of its con&s;olations. Prayer is the com|mand of God; the plain, po&s;itive, repeated injunction of the Mo&s;t High, who declares, "He will be inquired of." This is enough to &s;ecure the obedience of the Chri&s;tian, even though a promi&s;e were not, as it always is, attached to the com|mand. But in this ca&s;e the promi&s;e is as clear as the precept: <Q><HI>A&s;k,</HI> and ye &s;hall
<PB N="307" REF="316"><HI>receive;</HI></Q>&mdash;<HI>"Seek,</HI> and ye &s;hall <HI>find."</HI> this is enough for the plain Chri&s;tian. As to the <HI>manner</HI> in which prayer is made to coincide with the general &s;cheme of God's plan in the government of human affairs; how God has left him&s;elf at liberty to reconcile our prayer with his own predetermined will, the Chri&s;tian does not very critically examine, his pre|ci&s;e and immediate duty being to pray and not to examine; and probably this being among the <Q>&s;ecret things which belong to God,</Q> and not to us, it will lie hidden among tho&s;e numberle&s;s my&s;|teries which we &s;hall not fully under&s;tand till faith is lo&s;t in &s;ight.</P>
<P>In the mean time it is enough for the humble believer to be a&s;&s; that the Judge of all the earth is doing right: it is enough for him to be a&s;&s;ured in that word of God "which cannot lie," of numberle&s;s actual in&s;tances of the efficacy of prayer in obtaining ble&s;&s;ings and avert|ing calamities, both national and indi|vidual
<PB N="308" REF="317">vidual: it is enough for him to be con|vinced experimentally, by that internal evidence which is perhaps paramount to all other evidence, the comfort he has received from prayer when all other comforts have failed:&mdash;and above all, to and with the &s;ame motive with which we began, the only motive indeed which <HI>he</HI> requires for the performance of any duty, &mdash;it is motive enough for him, &mdash;that <HI>thus &s;aith the Lord.</HI> For when a &s;erious Chri&s;tian has once got a plain unequivocal command from his Maker on any point, he never &s;u&s;pends his obedience while he is amu&s;ing him&s;elf with looking about for &s;ubordinate motives of action. In&s;tead of curiou&s;ly analy&s;ing the nature of the duty, he con&s;iders how he &s;hall be&s;t fulfil it: for on the&s;e points at lea&s;t it may be &s;aid without controver&s;y, that <Q>the igno|rant (and here who is <HI>not</HI> ignorant?) <HI>have nothing to do with the law but to obey it?</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="318">Others there are who perhaps not con|troverting any of the&s;e premi&s;es, yet neglect to build practical con&s;equences on the admi&s;&s;ion of them; who neither deny|ing the duty nor the efficacy of prayer, yet go on to live either in the irregular ob|&s;ervance, or the total neglect of it, as appetite, or plea&s;ure, or bu&s;ine&s;s, or hu|mour may happen to predominate; and who, by living almo&s;t without prayer, may be &s;aid <Q>to live almo&s;t without God in the world.</Q> To &s;uch we can only &s;ay, that they little know what they lo&s;e. The time is ha&s;tening on when they will look upon the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings as invaluable which now they think not worth a&s;king for. <Q>O that they were wi&s;e! that they under&s;tood this! that they would con|&s;ider their latter end!</Q></P>
<P>There are again others, who it is to be feared, having once lived in the habit of prayer, yet not having been well|grounded in tho&s;e principles of faith and repentance on which genuine prayer is
<PB N="310" REF="319">built, have by degrees totally di&s;continued it. "They do not find," &s;ay they, <Q>that their affairs pro&s;per the better or the wor&s;e; or perhaps they were un|&s;ucce&s;sful in their affairs even before they dropt the practice, and &s;o had no encouragement to go on.</Q> They do not <HI>know</HI> that they had no encourage|ment; they do not <HI>know</HI> how much wor&s;e their affairs might have gone on, had they di&s;continued it &s;ooner, or how their prayers helped to retard their ruin. Or they do not <HI>know</HI> that perhaps <Q>they a&s;ked ami&s;s;</Q> or that, if they had obtained what they a&s;ked, they might have been far more unhappy. For a true believer never "re&s;trains prayer" becau&s;e he is not certain he obtains every individual reque&s;t; for he is per&s;uaded that God, in compa&s;&s;ion to our ignorance, &s;ometimes in great mercy withholds what we de&s;ire, and often di&s;appoints his mo&s;t favoured children by giving them, not what they a&s;k, but what he knows is really good
<PB N="311" REF="320">for them. The froward child, as a pious prelate <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bi&s;hop Hall.</NOTE> ob&s;erves, cries for the &s;hining blade which the tender parent withholds, knowing it would cut his fingers.</P>
<P>Thus to per&s;evere when we have not the encouragement of vi&s;ible &s;ucce&s;s is an evidence of tried faith. Of this holy per|&s;everance Job was a noble in&s;tance. Defeat and di&s;appointment rather &s;timu|lated than &s;topped <HI>his</HI> prayers. Though in a vehement &s;train of pa&s;&s;ionate eloquence he exclaims, <Q>I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment:</Q> yet &s;o per&s;uaded was he of the duty of continuing this holy importunity, that he per&s;i&s;ted again&s;t human hope, till he attained to that pitch of un&s;haken faith by which he was enabled to break out into that &s;ublime apo&s;trophe, <Q>Though he &s;lay me, I will tru&s;t in him.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="321">But may we not &s;ay that there is a con|&s;iderable cla&s;s who not only bring none of the objections which we have &s;tated again&s;t the u&s;e of prayer; who are &s;o far from re|jecting, that they are exact and regular in the performance of it; who yet take it up on as low ground as is con&s;i&s;tent with their ideas of their own &s;afety; who, while they con&s;ider prayer as an indi&s;pen|&s;able form, believe nothing of that change of heart which it is intended to produce? Many who yet adhere &s;crupulou&s;ly to the latter, are &s;o far from entering into the &s;pirit of this duty, that they are &s;trongly inclined to &s;u&s;pect tho&s;e of hypocri&s;y who adopt the true &s;criptural views of prayer. Nay, as even the Bible may be &s;o wre&s;ted as to be made to &s;peak almo&s;t any language in &s;upport of almo&s;t any opinion, the&s;e per&s;ons lay hold on Scripture it&s;elf to bear them out in their own &s;light views of this duty; and they profe&s;s to borrow from it the ground of that cen&s;ure which
<PB N="313" REF="322">they ca&s;t on the more &s;erious Chri&s;tians. Among the many pa&s;&s;ages which have been made to convey a meaning foreign to its original de&s;ign, none has been &s;eized upon with more avidity by &s;uch per&s;ons than the pointed cen&s;ures of our Saviour on tho&s;e <Q>who for a pretence make long prayers;</Q> as well as on tho&s;e <Q>who u&s;e vain repetitions and think they &s;hall be heard for much &s;peaking.</Q> Now the things here intended to be reproved were the hypocri&s;y of the Phari&s;ees and the ignorance of the heathen, together with tho&s;e who depended on the &s;ucce&s;s of their prayers, while they imitated the deceit of the one or the folly of the other. But our Saviour never meant tho&s;e &s;evere reprehen&s;ions &s;hould cool or abridge the devotion of pious Chri&s;tians, to which they do not apply.</P>
<P>More or fewer words, however, &s;o little con&s;titute the value of prayer, that there is no doubt but one of the mo&s;t affecting &s;pecimens is the &s;hort petition of the
<PB N="314" REF="323">Publican; full fraught as it is with that &s;pirit of contrition and &s;elf-aba&s;ement which is the very principle and &s;oul of prayer. And this perhaps is the be&s;t model for that &s;udden lifting up of the heart which we call ejaculation. But I doubt in general, whether the few ha&s;ty words to which the&s;e frugal petitioners would &s;tint the &s;canty devotions of others, will be always found ample enough to &s;atisfy the humble penitent, who, being a &s;inner, has much to confe&s;s; who, hoping he is a pardoned &s;inner, has much to acknowledge. Such an one perhaps cannot always pour out the fullne&s;s of his &s;oul in the pre&s;cribed abridg|ments. Even the &s;incere&s;t Chri&s;tian, when he wi&s;hes to find his heart warm, has often to lament its coldne&s;s. Though he feel that he has received much, and has there|fore much to be thankful for, yet he is not able at once to bring his wayward &s;pirit into &s;uch a po&s;ture as &s;hall fit it for the &s;olemn bu&s;ine&s;s; for &s;uch an one has not merely his form to repeat, but he has his
<PB N="315" REF="324">peace to make. A devout &s;upplicant too will labour to a&s;&s;ect and warm his mind with a &s;en&s;e of the attributes of God, in imitation of the holy men of old. Like Jeho&s;ophat, he will &s;ometimes enumerate <Q>the power, and the might, and the mercies of the Mo&s;t High,</Q> in order to &s;tir up the affections of awe, and gratitude, and humility in his own &s;oul <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Chron. xx. 5, 6.</NOTE>. He has the example of his Saviour, who&s;e heart dilated with the expre&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame holy affections: <Q>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth</Q>. A heart thus warmed with divine love cannot always &s;crupulou&s;ly limit it&s;elf to the mere <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> of prayer, if I may &s;o &s;peak. The humble &s;upplicant though he be no longer <HI>governed</HI> by a love of the world, yet grieves to find that he cannot totally exclude it from his thoughts. Though he has on the whole, a deep &s;en&s;e of his own wants and of God's abundant fullne&s;s to &s;upply
<PB N="316" REF="325">them, yet when he mo&s;t wi&s;hes to be rejoicing in the&s;e &s;trong motives for love and gratitude, alas! even then, he has to mourn that his thoughts are gone a&s;tray after &s;ome "trifle, lighter than vanity it|&s;elf." The be&s;t Chri&s;tian is but too liable, during the temptations of the day, to be en&s;nared by <Q>the lu&s;t of the eye, and the pride of life,</Q> and is not always brought without effort to reflect, that he is but du&s;t and a&s;hes. How can even good per&s;ons, who are ju&s;t come perhaps from li&s;tening to the flattery of their fellow-worms, ac|knowledge before God, without any pre|paration of the heart, that they are mi&s;e|rable &s;inners? They require a little time, to impre&s;s on their own &s;ouls the &s;olemn confe&s;&s;ions of &s;in they are making to Him, without which, brevity and not length might con&s;titute hypocri&s;y. Even the &s;incerely pious have in prayer grievous wanderings to lament, from which others mi&s;takingly &s;uppo&s;e the advanced Chri&s;tian to be exempt. Such wanderings that, as
<PB N="317" REF="326">an old divine has ob&s;erved, it would ex|ceedingly humble a good man, could he, after he had prayed, be made to &s;ee his prayers written down, with interlineations of all the vain and impertinent thoughts which had thru&s;t them&s;elves in among&s;t them. So that &s;uch an one will indeed, from a &s;en&s;e of the&s;e di&s;tractions, feel deep occa&s;ion with the Prophet to a&s;k forgive|ne&s;s for "the iniquity of his <HI>holy</HI> things:" and would find cau&s;e enough for humi|liation every night, had he to lament the &s;ins of his prayers only.</P>
<P>We know that &s;uch a brief petition as, "Lord help my unbelief," if the &s;uppli|cant be in &s;o happy a frame, and the prayer be darted with &s;uch &s;trong faith that his very &s;oul mounts with the petition, may &s;uffice to draw down a ble&s;&s;ing which may be withheld from the more prolix peti|tioner: yet, if by prayer we do not mean a mere form of words, whether they be long or &s;hort; if the true de&s;inition of
<PB N="318" REF="327">prayer be, that it is <HI>the de&s;ire of the heart;</HI> if it be that &s;ecret communion between God and the &s;oul which is the very breath and being of religion; then is the Scrip|ture &s;o far from &s;ugge&s;ting that &s;hort mea&s;ure of which it is accu&s;ed, that it expre&s;sly &s;ays, "Pray without cea&s;ing:" &mdash;"Pray evermore:"&mdash; <Q>I will that men pray every where:"&mdash; "Continue in&s;tant in prayer.</Q></P>
<P>If &s;uch "repetitions" as the&s;e objectors reprobate, &s;tir up de&s;ires as yet un|awakened, for "<HI>vain</HI> repetitions" are &s;uch as awaken, or expre&s;s no new de&s;ire, and &s;erve no religious purpo&s;e, then are "repetitions" not to be condemned. And if it be true that our Saviour gave the warning again&s;t "long prayers" in the &s;en&s;e the&s;e allege; if he gave the caution again&s;t vain repetitions in the &s;en&s;e the&s;e believe; then he broke his own rule in both in&s;tances: for once we are told <Q>he continued <HI>all night</HI> in prayer to God.</Q>
<PB N="319" REF="328">And again, in a mo&s;t awful cri&s;is of his life, it is expre&s;sly &s;aid, "He prayed the <HI>third time,</HI> u&s;ing the <HI>&s;ame words</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxvi. 44</NOTE>".</P>
<P>But as it is the effect of prayer to <HI>expand</HI> the affections as well as to <HI>&s;anctify</HI> them, the benevolent Chri&s;tian is not &s;atisfied to commend him&s;elf alone to the Divine favour. The heart which is full of the love of God, will overflow with love to its neighbour. All that are near to him&s;elf he wi&s;hes to bring near to God. Religion makes a man &s;o liberal of &s;oul, that he cannot endure to re&s;trict any thing, much le&s;s divine mercies, to him&s;elf: he &s;pi|ritualizes the &s;ocial affections, by adding interce&s;&s;ory to per&s;onal prayer: for he knows, that petitioning for others is one of the be&s;t methods of exerci&s;ing and en|larging our love and charity towards them. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to produce any of the numberlefs in&s;tances with which Scripture abounds, on the efficacy of in|terce&s;&s;ion:
<PB N="320" REF="329">I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to a few ob&s;ervations on the benefits it brings to him who offers it.&mdash;When we pray for the objects of our deare&s;t regard, it purifies love: when we pray for tho&s;e with whom we have worldly intercour&s;e, it &s;moothes down the &s;wellings of envy, and bids the tumults of ambition &s;ub&s;ide: when we pray for our country, it &s;anc|tifies patrioti&s;m: when we pray for tho&s;e in authority, it adds a divine motive to human obedience: when we pray for our enemies, it &s;oftens the &s;avagene&s;s of war, and mollifies hatred into &s;orrow. And we can be&s;t learn, nay, we can only learn, the difficult duty of forgiving tho&s;e who have offended us, when we bring our&s;elves to pray for them to Him whom we our&s;elves daily offend. When tho&s;e who are the faithful followers of the &s;ame Divine Ma&s;ter pray for each other, the reciprocal interce&s;&s;ion be&s;t realizes that beautiful idea of <Q>the Communion of Saints.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="330">Some are for confining their interce&s;&s;ions only to the good, as if none but per&s;ons of merit were entitled to our prayers. Merit! who has it?
