<L>IN ev'ry age, the trump of deathle&s;s fame</L>
<L>Proclaims the warrior's and the poet's name;</L>
<L>Painting and &s;culpture all the pow'rs combine,</L>
<L>And <HI>laurels</HI> deck the bard's and hero's &s;hrine.</L>
<L>No further can the parallel extend,</L>
<L>The poet's honours on &s;ucce&s;s depend;</L>
<L>While Fortune's frown can ne'er mole&s;t the brave,</L>
<L>Nor bla&s;t the laurel &s;pringing from his grave.</L>
<L>An equal wreath impartial Fame &s;upplies,</L>
<L>To him who conquers, and to him who dies;</L>
<L>For Briti&s;h valor was di&s;played, not more</L>
<L>On Nile's proud flood, than Helder's barren &s;hore!</L>
<L>The chance of war the brave&s;t may control,</L>
<L>But leaves untouch'd the courage of the &s;oul;</L>
<L>And England gives her heroes, ever dear!</L>
<L>The &s;hout of triumph, or the &s;tarting tear.</L>
<L>Not &s;o the Bard&mdash;with him &s;ucce&s;s is all!</L>
<L>When Fortune frowns, his air-built ca&s;tles fall:</L>
<L>But if &s;he &s;miles, he &s;ails with pro&s;perous breeze,</L>
<L>Like the &s;mall Nautilus o'er Summer &s;eas;</L>
<L>Who&s;e little oars on ocean's bo&s;om &s;weep,</L>
<L>Fearle&s;s of all the mon&s;ters of the deep.</L>

<STAGE>(After a pau&s;e.)</STAGE>
<L>Oft at <HI>this Bar,</HI> our Author has been <HI>tried,</HI></L>
<L>Where Engli&s;h Judges take the pris'ner's &s;ide!</L>
<L>Guilty of faults no doubt he will appear,</L>
<L>But human errors find acquittal here&mdash;</L>
<L>Where e'en the friendle&s;s always meet &s;upport,</L>
<L>From hone&s;t Juries, and an upright Court.</L>
<L>Critics, who rule o'er politics and plays,</L>
<L>If you are adver&s;e, vain the poet's lays!</L>
<L>"You, who with equal hands the balance hold,</L>

<P>Then I tru&s;t, Madam, you will be patriot enough to agree with me, that a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a nation is poor, who&s;e only wealth is importation&mdash;that therefore the humble native arti&s;t may ever hope to obtain from his countrymen tho&s;e fo&s;tering &s;miles, without which genius mu&s;t &s;icken and in|du&s;try decay. But it requires no <HI>valet de place</HI> to conduct you through the purlieus of fa&s;hion, for now the way of the world is, for every one to pur&s;ue their own way, and following the fa&s;hion is differing as much as po&s;&s;ible from the re&s;t of your acquaintance.</P>

<P>To Mr. Handy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; as &s;oon as the conte&s;t was over Henry pre&s;ented him&s;elf; I was &s;urprized at &s;eeing a young man &s;o hand&s;ome and elegant as Henry is&mdash;then I placed the medal round Henry's neck, and I was told that poor Henry&mdash;</P>

<P>Henry!&mdash;So, my love! this is your account of Mr. Robert Handy?</P>

<P>You danced with your lover?</P>

<P>Oh! no, papa&mdash;and I am certain he don't love me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Philip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, papa; for when he touched my hand, he trembled as if I terrified him; and in|&s;tead of looking at me as you do, who I am &s;ure love me, when our eyes met, he withdrew his and ca&s;t them on the ground.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>And the&s;e are the rea&s;ons which make you conclude he does not love you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, papa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Philip.</SPEAKER>
<P>And probably you could adduce proof equally convincing that you don't love him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh yes&mdash;quite; for in the dance he &s;ometimes paid attention to other young women, and I was &s;o angry with him! Now, you know, papa, I love you&mdash;and I am &s;ure I &s;hould not have been angry with you, had you done &s;o.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! now I am certain I am not in love; for I feel no rankling at my heart. I feel the &s;ofte&s;t, &s;weete&s;t &s;en&s;ation I ever experienced. But, papa, you mu&s;t come to the lawn.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Philip.</SPEAKER>
<P>When I left my native country, I le&s;t it with a heart lacerated by every wound that the fal&s;ehood of others or my own con&s;cience could inflict. Hateful to my&s;elf, I became the victim of di&s;&s;ipation&mdash;I ru&s;hed to the gaming table, and &s;oon became the dupe of villains.&mdash;My ample fortune
<PB N="51" REF="50">was lo&s;t; I detected one in the act of &s;raud, and having brought him to my feet, he confe&s;&s;ed a plan had been laid for my ruin; that he was but an humble in&s;trument; for that the man who, by his &s;uperior genius, &s;tood po&s;&s;effed of all the mortgages and &s;ecurities I had given, was one Mortington.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard your name him before. Did you not know this Morrington?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Philip.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; he, like his deeds, avoided the light&mdash;Ever dark, &s;ubtle, and my&s;terious. Col|lecting the &s;cattered remnant of my fortune, I wan|dered wretched and de&s;olare, till, in a peaceful village, I fir&s;t beheld thy mother, humble in birth, but exalted in virtue. The morning after our marriage &s;he received a packet, containing the&s;e words: <Q>The reward of virtuous love, pre&s;ented by a repentant villain;</Q> and which al&s;o contained bills and notes to the high amount of ten thou&s;and pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s B.</SPEAKER>
<P>And no name?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Philip.</SPEAKER>
<P>None; nor could I ever gue&s;s at the generous donor. I need not tell thee what my heart &s;uffered when death deprived me of her. Thus circum&s;tanced, this good man, Sir Abel Handy, propo&s;ed to unite our families by mar|riage; and in con&s;ideration of what he termed the honor of our alliance, agreed to pay off every in|cumbrance on my e&s;tates, and &s;ettle them as a portion on you and his &s;on. Yet &s;till another wonder remains.&mdash;When I arrive, I find no claim whatever has been made, either by Morrington or his agents. What am I to think? Can Mor|rington have peri&s;hed, and with him his large claims to my property? Or, does he withhold the blow, to make it fall more heavily?</P>
