<HEAD>Bear ye one another's Burthens.</HEAD>
<P>ONCE upon a time methought I &s;et out upon a long journey, and the place through which I travelled appeared to be a dark Valley which was called the Valley of Tears. It had obtained this name not only on account of the many &s;orrowful adventures which poor pa&s;&s;engers commonly meet with in their journey through it; but al&s;o becau&s;e mo&s;t of the&s;e Travellers entered it weeping and cry|ing, and left it in very great pain and angui&s;h. This va&s;t valley was full of people of all colours, ages, &s;izes, and de&s;criptions. But whether white or black, or tawney, all were travelling the &s;ame road; or rather they were taking different little paths which all led to the &s;ame common end.</P>
<P>Now it was remarkable that notwith&s;tanding the different complexions, ages, and tempers of this va&s;t variety of people, yet all re&s;embled each other in this one re&s;pect, that each had a burthen on his back which he was de&s;tined to carry through the toil and heat of the day, until he &s;hould ar|rive by a longer or &s;horter cour&s;e at his journey's end. The&s;e burthens would in general have made the pilgrimage quite intolerable, had not the Lord of the Valley, out of his great compa&s;&s;ion for the&s;e poor Pilgrims, provided among other things, the following means for their relief.</P>
<P>In their full view over the entrance of the Val|ley, there were written in great letters the follow|ing words,
<Q><PB N="3" REF="3">
Bear ye one another's Burthens.</Q></P>
<P>Now I &s;aw in my vi&s;ion that many of the Tra|vellers hurried on without &s;topping to read this in&s;truction, and others, though they had once read it, yet paid little or no attention to it. A third &s;ort thought it very good advice for other people, but very &s;eldom applied it to them&s;elves. In &s;hort I &s;aw that too many of tho&s;e people were of opinion that they had burthens enough of their own, and that there was therefore no occa&s;ion to take upon them tho&s;e of others; &s;o each tried to make his own load as light, and his own journey as plea&s;ant as he could, without &s;o much as once ca&s;ting a thought on a poor over-loaded neighbour. Here however I have to make a rather &s;ingular remark, by which I &s;hall plainly &s;hew the folly of the&s;e &s;elfi&s;h people. It was &s;o ordered and contrived by the Lord of this valley, that if any one &s;tretched out his hand to lighten a neighbour's burthen, in fact he never failed to find that he at that moment al&s;o lightened his own. Be&s;ides, the obligation to help each other, and the benefit of doing &s;o were mutual. If a man helped his neighbour it commonly happened that &s;ome other neighbour came by and by and helped him in his turn; for there was no &s;uch thing as what we call <HI>independence</HI> in the whole Valley. Not one of all the&s;e Travellers, however &s;tout and &s;trong, could move on comfortably without a&s;&s;i&s;tance, for &s;o the Lord of the Valley, who&s;e laws were all of them kind and good, had expre&s;sly ordained.</P>
<P>I &s;tood &s;till to watch the progre&s;s of the&s;e poor way-faring people, who moved &s;lowly on, like &s;o many Ticket-porters, with burthens of various
<PB N="4" REF="4">
kinds on their backs; of which &s;ome were heavier, and &s;ome were lighter, but from a burthen of one kind or other, not one Traveller was entirely free.</P>

<HEAD>The Widow.</HEAD>
<P>A &s;orrowful Widow, oppre&s;&s;ed with the burthen of grief for the lo&s;s of an affectionate hu&s;band, would have been bowed down by her heavy load, had not the &s;urviving children with great alacrity &s;tepped forward and &s;upported her. Their kind|ne&s;s after a while, &s;o much lightened the load which threatened at fir&s;t to be intolerable, that &s;he even went on her way with chearfulne&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>The Hu&s;band.</HEAD>
<P>I next &s;aw a poor old man tottering under a bur|then &s;o heavy, that I expected him every mo|ment to &s;ink under it. I peeped into his pack, and &s;aw it was made up of many &s;ad articles; there was poverty, oppre&s;&s;ion, &s;ickne&s;s, debt, and what made by far the heavie&s;t part, undutiful children. I was wondering how it was that he got on even &s;o well as he did, till I &s;pied his wife, a kind meek, Chri&s;tian woman, who was doing her ut|mo&s;t to a&s;&s;i&s;t him. She quietly got behind, gently laid her &s;houlder to the burthen, and carried a much larger proportion of it than appeared to me when I was at a di&s;tance. She not only &s;u&s;tained him by her &s;trength, but cheered him by her coun|&s;els. "She told him that through much tribula|tion we mu&s;t enter into re&s;t," that "he that over|cometh &s;hall inherit all things." In &s;hort, &s;he &s;o &s;upported his fainting &s;pirit, that he was enabled to "run with patience the race that was &s;et before him."</P>

<HEAD>The kind Neighbour.</HEAD>
<P>An infirm blind woman was creeping forward with a very heavy burthen, in which were packed &s;ick|ne&s;s and want, with numberle&s;s other of tho&s;e raw materials, out of which human mi&s;ery is worked up. She was &s;o weak that &s;he could not have got on at all, had it not been for the kind a&s;&s;i&s;tance of another woman almo&s;t as poor as her&s;elf; who, though &s;he had no light burthen of her own, cheer|fully lent an helping hand to a fellow traveller, who was &s;till more heavily laden. This friend had indeed little or nothing to give, but the very voice of kindne&s;s is &s;oothing to the weary. And I remarked in many other ca&s;es, that it was not &s;o much the degree of the help afforded, as the manner of helping that lightened the burthens. Some had a coar&s;e, rough clum&s;y way of a&s;&s;i&s;ting a neighbour, which, though in fact it might be of real u&s;e, yet &s;eemed, by galling the Travellers, to add to the load it was intended to lighten; while I ob&s;erved in others that &s;o cheap a kindne&s;s as a mild word, or even an affectionate look made a poor burthened wretch move on cheerily. The bare feeling that &s;ome human being cared for him, &s;eemed to lighten the load. But to return to this kind neighbour. She had a little old book in her hand, the covers of which were worn out by much u&s;e. When &s;he &s;aw the blind woman ready to faint, &s;he would read her a few words out of this book, &s;uch as the following&mdash;"Ble&s;&s;ed are the poor in &s;pirit, for theirs is the kingdom of hea|ven." "Ble&s;&s;ed are they that mourn, for they &s;hall be comforted." "I will never leave thee nor for|&s;ake thee." "For our light affliction, which is but
<PB N="6" REF="6">
for a moment, worketh out for us a far more ex|ceeding and eternal weight of glory."</P>

<HEAD>The Clergyman.</HEAD>
<P>A pious Mini&s;ter, &s;inking under the weight of a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed pari&s;h, who&s;e worldly wants he was to|tally unable to bear, was &s;uddenly relieved by a good widow, who come up and took all the &s;ick and hungry on her own &s;houlders. The burthen of the pari&s;h thus divided became tolerable. The Mini&s;ter, being no longer bowed down by the temporal di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his people, applied him&s;elf chearfully to his own part of the weight. And it was plea&s;ant to &s;ee how tho&s;e two per&s;ons, neither of them very &s;trong, or rich, or healthy, by thus kindly uniting together, were enabled to bear the weight of a whole pari&s;h; though &s;ingly, either of them mu&s;t have &s;unk under the attempt. And I remember one great grief I felt during my whole journey was, that I did not &s;ee more of this union and concurring kindne&s;s, by which all the burthens might have been &s;o ea&s;ily divided. It troubled me to ob&s;erve, that of all the laws of the Valley there was not one more frequently broken than <HI>the law of kindne&s;&s;.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Negroes.</HEAD>
<P>I now &s;pied a &s;warm of poor black men, women, and children, a multitude which no man could number; the&s;e groaned, and toiled, and &s;weated and bled under far heavier loads than I had yet &s;een. But for a while no man helped them; at length a few White travellers were touched with the &s;or|rowful &s;ighing of tho&s;e millions, and very heartily did they put their hands to the burthens; but
<PB N="7" REF="7">
their number was not quite equal to the work they had undertaken. I perceived, however, that they never lo&s;t &s;ight of tho&s;e poor heavy-laden wretches and as the number of the&s;e generous helpers encrea&s;|ed, I felt a comfortable hope, that before all the blacks got out of the Valley, the whites would fairly divide the burthen, and the loads would be effectually lightened.</P>
<P>Among the travellers, I had occa&s;ion to remark, that tho&s;e who mo&s;t kicked and &s;truggled under their burthens, only made them &s;o much the hea|vier; for their &s;houlders became extremely galled by tho&s;e vain &s;truggles. The load, if borne pa|tiently, would in the end have turned even to the advantage of the bearers (for &s;o the Lord of the Valley had kindly decreed) but as to the&s;e grum|blers they had all the &s;mart and none of the benefit. But the thing which made all the&s;e burthens &s;eem &s;o very heavy was, that in every one without ex|ception, there was a certain <HI>inner pacquet,</HI> which mo&s;t of the Travellers took pains to conceal, and carefully wrap up; and while they were forward enough to complain of the other part of their bur|thens, few &s;aid a word about this; though in truth it was the pre&s;&s;ing weight of this <HI>&s;ecret pacquet</HI> which &s;erved to render the general burthen &s;o into|lerable. In &s;pite of all their caution, I contrived to get a peep at it, I found in each that this pacquet had the &s;ame label; the word SIN was written on all as a general title, and in ink &s;o black that they could not wa&s;h it out. I ob&s;erved that mo&s;t of them took no &s;mall pains to hide the writing; but I was &s;urprized to &s;ee that they did not try to get rid of the load but the label. If any kind friend who a&s;&s;i&s;ted the&s;e people in bearing their burthens,
<PB N="8" REF="8">
did but &s;o much as hint at the <HI>&s;ecret pacquet,</HI> or ad|vi&s;e them to get rid of it, they took fire at once, and commonly denied they had any &s;uch article in their portmanteau; and it was tho&s;e who&s;e <HI>&s;ecret pacquet</HI> &s;welled to the mo&s;t enormous &s;ize, who mo&s;t &s;toutly denied they had any.</P>
<P>I &s;aw with plea&s;ure, however, that &s;ome who had long laboured heartily to get rid of this in|ward pacquet at length found it much dimini&s;hed, and the more this pacquet &s;hrunk in &s;ize, the lighter was the other part of their burthens al&s;o.</P>
<P>Then, methought, all at once, I heard a voice as it had been the voice of an angel, crying out and &s;aying, "Ye unhappy Pilgrims, why are ye troubled about the burthen which ye are doomed to bear through this Valley of Tears? Know ye not that as &s;oon as ye &s;hall have e&s;caped out of this Valley, the whole burthen &s;hall drop off, provided ye neglect not to remove that inward weight of SIN which principally oppre&s;&s;es you? Study then the whole Will of the Lord of this Valley. Learn from him how this heavy part of your burthens may now be le&s;&s;ened, and how at la&s;t it &s;hall be removed for ever. Be comforted. Faith and Hope may cheer you even in this Valley. The pa&s;&s;age, though it &s;eems long to weary Travellers, is comparatively &s;hort; for beyond it there is a Land of everla&s;ting Re&s;t, where ye &s;hall hunger no more, neither thir&s;t any more, where ye &s;hall be led by living foun|tains of waters, and all tears &s;hall be wiped away from your eyes.</P>
