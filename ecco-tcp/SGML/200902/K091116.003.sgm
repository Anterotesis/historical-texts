<P>WHEN the &s;ick languor of the faintings gave place to reflection, I found my&s;elf in my own bed; whither I un|der&s;tood I had been conveyed by the or|ders of Lord Arlington, as &s;oon as the wound was &s;taunched:&mdash;his proved &s;o &s;light, that it left him no pretence for apprehen&s;ion. Eagerly I enquired for Lady Pembroke, when to my inexpre&s;&s;i|ble rage and a&s;toni&s;hment I was informed, &s;he had been turned, from my door, whi|ther friend&s;hip led her to venture a re|pul&s;e.
<PB N="2" REF="5">
The immaculate character of that admirable woman I thought even Lord Arlington would have re&s;pected; but with|out deigning to inform him&s;elf of the real circum&s;tances of the unfore&s;een interview he had &s;o dreadfully interrupted, by this rude implication he treated two of the mo&s;t e&s;timable and di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;ons in the kingdom as abettors, if not con|trivers, of his di&s;honor.&mdash;The little blood left in my veins turned to gall at the idea. I watched an opportunity to tear away the bandages; and di&s;dainfully re&s;igning my&s;elf to a premature fate, endeavoured to forget the generous hearts this ra&s;h action would pierce.&mdash;The awful God who&s;e ju&s;tice I thus que&s;tioned, &s;till ex|tended to me his mercy&mdash;my dangerous &s;ituation was di&s;covered in time by my careful attendants, who infinitely more attached to me than their Lord, u&s;ed every means to prolong the life he, perhaps, wi&s;hed at its period.</P>
<P>In the cruel &s;tate of mind which dic|tated this de&s;perate re&s;olution, it proved
<PB N="3" REF="6">
a melancholy advantage; as the injury now fell on my con&s;titution only, and my intellects e&s;caped. It was many months ere I had &s;trength to cro&s;s a room, or &s;pirts to venture a que&s;tion&mdash;during this memorable interval I called together every enfeebled power, and placing my con&s;ci|ence as umpire between my&s;elf and Lord Arlington, fixed and a&s;certained the rights of either. Convicted even by my own heart of imprudence, I wondered not he con&s;trued error into guilt; and while thus cool offered him every vindication of my innocence he could rea&s;onably de|&s;ire: but Lord Arlington was the &s;lave of pa&s;&s;ion and caprice, and not having firmne&s;s of &s;oul to form, or fix, a judg|ment, followed through years with in|vincible ob&s;tinacy the impre&s;&s;ion of the fir&s;t moment.&mdash;From this period he ever treated me as an artful woman, who&s; e licentious conduct had obliged him to ri&s;que his life in vain defence of that honor already &s;ullied, and lo&s;t in my
<PB N="4" REF="7">
per&s;on; nor did he affect to a&s;&s;ert his legal rights from any other rea&s;on than to &s;eparate me from Lord E&s;&s;ex. This con|duct, and the mi&s;repre&s;entations of Lady E&s;&s;ex, blazed the fatal incident throughout the Court, and fixed a &s;tain on my charac|ter, time could never era&s;e&mdash;happily that &s;tain reached not my per&s;on or my heart, and an inju&s;tice &s;o aggravating on the part of Lord Arlington, entitled me to forgive the little error in my&s;elf which oc|ca&s;ioned it.</P>
<P>In this conjuncture I once more turned my tearful eyes every way around in &s;earch of a protector to interfere between me, and a fate alike unmerited and &s;e|vere.&mdash;Alas! there was not a human be|ing virtue allowed me to call to my aid; and I exerci&s;ed the faculties Heaven had &s;o unexpectedly ble&s;&s;ed me with, by re|&s;olving to &s;uffer with patience.</P>
<P>Elizabeth Vernon (our old companion) the fair and gentle cou&s;in of Lord E&s;&s;ex, re&s;olved if po&s;&s;ible to &s;ee me&mdash;&s;he ad|dre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="5" REF="8">
Lord Arlington, and demanded that privilege; the favor &s;he held with the Queen hindered him from denying a reque&s;t he granted with the utmo&s;t re|luctance. That &s;weet girl bathed me in the tears of innocence and affection&mdash;&s;he told me the fear le&s;t his pre&s;ence &s;hould incen&s;e Lord Arlington to further brutality, had induced E&s;&s;ex, when I lo&s;t my &s;en&s;es, to withdraw from a &s;cene which rent his very heart&mdash;the &s;ame rea&s;on &s;till obliged him to remain at a di&s;tance.&mdash;That dur|ing the long and dire uncertainty attend|ing my illne&s;s, he had &s;carcely breathed&mdash;his own &s;oul continually told him how pure mine was. Fancy pre&s;ented me to him forever, pale, &s;peechle&s;s, expiring, my &s;ad eyes rivetted on his with a tender|ne&s;s death it&s;elf could not extingui&s;h: however guiltle&s;s of my blood, every drop which oozed from my veins &s;eemed to congeal on his heart; in fine, that al|mo&s;t deified by my &s;ufferings, and his &s;en&s;e of them, I reigned alone in his af|fections, which were from this moment
<PB N="6" REF="9">
con&s;ecrated to me by a mo&s;t convincing proof. Having u&s;ed the utmo&s;t art and diligence to di&s;cover how Lord Arlington &s;o &s;oon became apprized of his &s;ecret re|turn to England, and a meeting &s;o un|planned, and &s;udden, as to interrupt it almo&s;t immediately, though &s;uppo&s;ed to be as far off as Greenwich; Lord E&s;&s;ex learnt that his Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e being among the dome&s;tics he brought with him to Pembroke Hou&s;e, had quitted it as &s;oon as he alighted, and ha&s;tened to Greenwich in &s;earch of a girl attending on Lady E&s;&s;ex, of whom he was enamor|ed; through her means her Lady became likewi&s;e acquainted with his &s;ecret ar|rival without knowing its motive. That &s;u&s;picious woman had already remarked Lord Arlington was among the bridal train, and in his hearing publi&s;hed the return of her Lord, with all her own in|jurious &s;urmi&s;es&mdash;ill fortune for once had given them the colour of truth, and Lord Arlington needed no more than the hint to make him mount the &s;wifte&s;t hor&s;e and
<PB N="7" REF="10">
fly to &s;atisfy him&s;elf.&mdash;Lady E&s;&s;ex was quickly informed of an incident &s;he ought to have fore&s;een, and giving way to another extravagance, pa&s;&s;ionately conjured every friend &s;he met to follow, and prevent the conflict to which her Lord now &s;tood ex|po&s;ed&mdash;but when could friend&s;hip keep pace with love and vengeance? The &s;traggling mediators arrived only time enough to witne&s;s the event no human power could guard again&s;t. Incen&s;ed be|yond all bounds at the conduct of his Lady, the ra&s;h E&s;&s;ex took the only &s;tep wanting to my ruin. Determined to make her &s;hare the mi&s;ery &s;he had occa&s;ioned, he parted with her at once and forever&mdash;in vain were all her &s;ub&s;equent vows of &s;or|row and repentance&mdash;in vain had &s;he from that moment indulged hopes of his cooling and conciliating&mdash;his temper till this fatal period, no le&s;s yielding than fiery, now a&s;&s;umed a cold and philo&s;o|phic &s;ternne&s;s; in fine, that the grief and di&s;appointment to which Lady E&s;&s;ex re|&s;igned her&s;elf would &s;everely puni&s;h her
<PB N="8" REF="11">
unju&s;t &s;u&s;picions, and ere long relea&s;e her Lord from the ill-judged bondage he had hitherto groaned &s;o impatiently under."</P>
<P>The fair Elizabeth thus ended her re|cital, which was &s;o clear, conci&s;e, and affecting, that I could not avoid taxing her with being the emi&s;&s;ary of her cou&s;in; her blu&s;hes acquitted her, and be&s;poke a &s;ecret, time &s;oon explained. She was &s;ecretly beloved by the gallant South|ampton, that heroic friend who was only le&s;s attached to E&s;&s;ex than my&s;elf, and from him had learnt the various parti|culars public report could not appri&s;e her of.&mdash;I held my&s;elf infinitely indebted to her friend&s;hip, and through her means &s;ent that farewell to Lady Pembroke I was not allowed to pronounce.</P>
<P>It had been but too obvious through her whole recital, that I was totally the victim of calumny, nor could any human power now ju&s;tify me.&mdash;I had been found in the arms of E&s;&s;ex&mdash;the fact was indu|bitable, the true cau&s;e of that fatal impul&s;e not likely to be credited, even when re|peated.
<PB N="9" REF="12">
My youth, my wound, and my pa&s;t conduct, blended the ra&s;h judg|ment of the many with compa&s;&s;ion, but the mo&s;t liberal-minded ventured not to acquit me. Tho&s;e impa&s;&s;ioned vindica|tions the con&s;cious &s;oul of E&s;&s;ex offered, were always con&s;idered as a mere point of honor in him, and no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to his own ju&s;tification than mine, and thus only &s;erved to &s;tamp guilt on both.&mdash;Oh, misjudging world, how &s;everely on the mo&s;t &s;uperficial ob&s;ervation do&s;t thou venture to decide!&mdash;let the barbed ar|row of misfortune re&s;t in the bo&s;om it has wounded, nor by inhumanly tearing it out to di&s;cover whence it came, rack the heart already broken.</P>
<P>Defamed, dejected, and forgotten by all but the generous &s;i&s;ters of the Sydney family, I followed, once more, my fate in Lord Arlington; and reached again that Abbey de&s;tined alike to entomb me in playful childhood, and in bla&s;ted youth&mdash;the &s;ame imperious will which had de|&s;troyed me, had deprived that venerable man&s;ion of its &s;weet, its &s;olitary charms&mdash;the
<PB N="10" REF="13">
hallowed &s;pot where once the ivied trophies of time bound up the defaced ones of religion, pre&s;ented nothing now but a bare and barren level; and the lofty woods which &s;o long protected alike the living and the dead, had wholly given place to infant plantations, through the thinne&s;s of which the weary eye every where pierced: I turned with di&s;gu&s;t from the de&s;olated &s;cene, and locking my&s;elf up in the remote&s;t, and mo&s;t gloomy chamber of the Abbey, &s;pent my life in meditating on my every lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Lord Arlington now valuing me only as the appendage of his pride, con&s;oled him&s;elf for my undi&s;&s;embled aver&s;ion, and cared not what employed me, pro|vided I was yet his legal pri&s;oner.&mdash;Alas, I had no longer re&s;olution to re&s;t my hopes on any object&mdash;to form any &s;ubordinate de&s;ign, or to reap any &s;ub|ordinate plea&s;ure. The poor children &s;till &s;upported by my bounty, no more touched the Jute in my pre&s;ence&mdash;that over which my own fingers once wandered with the wild elegance of untried youth,
<PB N="11" REF="14">
now u&s;ele&s;s and un&s;trung, hung up, an emblem of the di&s;cordant &s;oul of its owner. Ta&s;te, genius, and &s;cience, tho&s;e rich columes with which enthu&s;ia&s;tic fancy erects in peaceful minds a thou&s;and light aerial &s;tructures, deep &s;unk, and broken in my heart, pre&s;ented to the mental eye a ruin more terrible than the noble&s;t &s;peculation ever pau&s;ed over.&mdash;Mi&s;an|thropy, black-vi&s;aged mi&s;anthropy, reign|ed there like a &s;olitary &s;avage, uncon|&s;cious of the value of tho&s;e trea&s;ures his rude hand every day more and more de|faced.</P>
<P>I was rou&s;ed one night with the infor|mation that a favorite &s;ervant of Lord Ar|lington's, who had long langui&s;hed in a con&s;umption, now found him&s;elf at the point of death, and importunately de|manded to &s;peak with me&mdash;but ill-di&s;|po&s;ed at this &s;ea&s;on even to the gentle offices of humanity, and convinced he could have nothing to impart I &s;hould think of con&s;equence, I rejected the re|que&s;t; but finding his Lord was inebri|ated beyond the power of comprehend|ing
<PB N="12" REF="15">
him, on being again &s;ollicited, I ro&s;e, and accompanied by a maid who loved me, entered the &s;ick man's chamber.&mdash;I ca&s;t a har&s;h and cold glance round, and hardly heard the thanks he gave me&mdash;having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed all the &s;ervants except the maid I mentioned, I prepared to li&s;ten to him, imagining &s;ome matter relative to his office of chief bailiff and &s;urveyor, alone, could thus di&s;turb his la&s;t hours.&mdash;"Lady, &s;aid he, in the hollow broken voice of approaching di&s;&s;olution, I could not have departed in peace had you not be&s;towed this indulgence&mdash;pardon me, I be&s;eech you, for propo&s;ing to my Lord the de&s;truction of tho&s;e ruins I have &s;ince &s;een too plainly your heart was ever wrapt in&mdash;alas, that propo&s;al co&s;ts me my life.&mdash;Conde&s;cend too to li&s;ten to a &s;ecret which continually drags back my &s;oul when &s;triving to quit her dungeon&mdash;my crime perhaps brings with it a &s;ufficient puni&s;hment.&mdash;In removing the rubbi&s;h of the artificial hermit's cell, in compli|ance with the directions of my Lord, I one day &s;aw a common laborer turn up
<PB N="13" REF="16">
&s;omething which tried his whole &s;trength, when ca&s;ting a quick and fearful glance around, he covered it with earth. I di&s;patched the men in hearing to another part, and &s;eizing the arm of him I had watched, I in&s;i&s;ted on &s;eeing what he had endeavoured to conceal&mdash;it proved to be a &s;mall iron che&s;t &s;trongly fa&s;tened&mdash;I agreed with him to convey it away till the evening, when he might rejoin me, and we would open it and divide the contents together. He yielded rather to nece&s;&s;ity than choice, and I took the ca&s;ket with a purpo&s;e, God has &s;everely puni&s;hed&mdash;the many keys intru&s;ted to my care &s;up|plied one which immediately opened it; under a number of papers and trifles of no value, I found a large &s;um in gold, and a few jewels&mdash;as I knew my part|ner in the di&s;covery had remarked that the che&s;t was heavy; in the room of the gold and jewels, I &s;ub&s;tituted an iron crucifix, and many ru&s;ty keys; then lock|ing the ca&s;ket, waited anxiou&s;ly for the evening. The poor laborer &s;eeing me return, wi&s;tfully examined my features,
<PB N="14" REF="17">
but not daring to expre&s;s the doubt vi|&s;ible in his own, expected in &s;ilence the deciding hour. I &s;uffered him to take infinite pains to break open a che&s;t I was con&s;cious would not repay the labor&mdash;great was the poor wretch's di&s;appoint|ment when he emptied it&mdash;I affected the &s;ame chagrin; but turning over the pa|pers, I offered to give him twenty nobles; a &s;ure proof, had he reflected a &s;ingle moment, that I mu&s;t have wronged him: he readily accepted this propo&s;al, and at my de&s;ire, promi&s;ed never to mention the incident; then with much apparent gratitude departed. Eagerly I replaced my guilty gains, and &s;ecretly re&s;olved to take an early opportunity of quitting my Lord to commence builder in London; but fear did not &s;uffer me for a time to venture this mea&s;ure; alas, I have wanted health &s;ince to do any thing&mdash;from this moment, peace, appetite, and re&s;t, have fled me&mdash;if worn out with watching, I dropt into a &s;lumber, the idea that my trea&s;ure was &s;tolen, has made me often &s;tart up, and regardle&s;s of the cold &s;weat
<PB N="15" REF="18">
the mere apprehen&s;ion has produced, I have flown in the dead of night to convince my&s;elf it was &s;afe&mdash;imaginary whi&s;pers have ever been near my bed, and uncertain forms have glided through my chamber&mdash;the dawn of day never gave me relief, every eye &s;eemed to dive into my &s;ecret, and every hand to be intent on impo|veri&s;hing me&mdash;in a word, Lady, to this &s;ad moment it has prematurely brought me; for many months doubtful whether I &s;hould &s;urvive, I have been con&s;idering how to be&s;tow that wealth I could no longer hope to enjoy&mdash;the poor man I &s;o ba&s;ely defrauded, of it, peri&s;hed a &s;hort time after by the fall of a pillar, and re&s;titution to him can never be made. It came into my head this evening, that you were &s;aid to have been brought up in the&s;e ruins; certainly I had often &s;een you walk and weep on the very &s;pot where this che&s;t was found; perhaps in giving it to you I only re&s;tore it to the right owner; accept it, Madam, and &s;wear you will never di&s;cover the gift to my Lord."&mdash;This reque&s;t appeared a
<PB N="16" REF="19">
needle&s;s injunction, if the trea&s;ure had not been obtained by defrauding Lord Arlington; and though perhaps I &s;hould have been &s;ilent through choice, I thought it beneath me to engage to be &s;o&mdash;find|ing me pau&s;e, he continued, "fear not any ill de&s;ign in this reque&s;t, Madam, you will one day be glad you complied with it, and for your own &s;ake alone is it propo&s;ed; the hand of my Lord is grudg|ing&mdash;yours bounteous as that of heaven.&mdash;Do not rob your&s;elf of the means to be liberal which now are offered to you&mdash;yet on no other condition than the vow of &s;ilence will I give it up." A &s;trange de|&s;ire to examine the papers, more than any I felt for the money, made me at la&s;t ac|quie&s;ce. My maid by his direction, drew the iron che&s;t from an ob&s;cure corner, and emptied it of both gold, jewels, and papers, which &s;he and I divided, and with &s;ome difficulty concealed till we reached my apartment&mdash;he &s;eemed only to have lived to make this di&s;covery, and a few hours after expiated his &s;in with his life.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="20">
While he &s;trove to impre&s;s my mind with the nece&s;&s;ity of concealing the ad|venture, I pondered deeply over it; not ea&s;ily di&s;cerning how I &s;hould interpret this &s;trange ordination of providence; it at la&s;t occurred to me the trea&s;ure might be put into my hands for the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance and comfort of my &s;i&s;ter&mdash;how did I know whether &s;he was not even then ha&s;tening towards me, perhaps impo|veri&s;hed, certainly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed?&mdash;Oh, how con&s;olatory &s;hould I find it to mini&s;ter to her external wants, though tho&s;e of her heart &s;hould be beyond my power of com|forting! The contempt I felt for Lord Arlington was rooted too deep to admit of my thus applying his fortune, had I been the unlimited mi&s;tre&s;s of it; I therefore &s;aw a degree of wi&s;dom and propriety in receiving and &s;ecreting a gift heaven &s;eemed &s;o &s;trangely to put into my hands, as if it were to forerun &s;ome yet unknown incident.</P>
<P>The papers con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of the corre&s;pondence between Mrs. Marlow and
<PB N="18" REF="21">
Father Anthony, while yet they were lo|vers, and after the cruel di&s;covery which annulled the nominal union&mdash;I peru&s;ed the&s;e invaluable epi&s;tles with pul&s;ations of tenderne&s;s I lately thought my&s;elf in|capable of; they recalled me to life and &s;en&s;ibility, and I gathered fortitude from tho&s;e who now were du&s;t; I rai&s;ed my eyes to heaven in &s;earch of their pure tran&s;lated &s;ouls, and wandering from pla|net to planet, fancied there mu&s;t be one peculiarly allotted to lovers now no lon|ger unhappy&mdash;A thou&s;and trifles who&s;e value mu&s;t ever be ideal and local, were pre&s;erved with the&s;e letters: cyphers, hair, &s;onnets, dear perpetuators of tho&s;e bright hours of youth we look back on with plea&s;ure to the late&s;t moment of decaying life. I ki&s;&s;ed the innocent re|liques of &s;uch an unhappy attachment with devout regard, and held them not the lea&s;t part of my legacy.</P>
<P>Time di&s;&s;ipated the flattering illu&s;ion which led me to expect my &s;i&s;ter&mdash;my mind &s;unk into its u&s;ual inertitude,
<PB N="19" REF="22">
and the acqui&s;ition remained, if not for|gotten, at lea&s;t neglected.</P>
<P>From this profound &s;tupor I was at la&s;t rou&s;ed as by an earthquake&mdash;Lord Arlington in hunting fell from his hor&s;e, and breaking &s;ome blood-ve&s;&s;el, was brought home to appearance lifele&s;s&mdash;con&s;cience and humanity called on me to forget my injuries; I made every effort to &s;ave him, and for a time he appeared to mend; but the incurable habit of inebriety he even at this period indulged, defeated both care and medicine; and after enduring a &s;eries of &s;ufferings which annihilated my &s;en&s;e of wrong, he expired in the prime of his days.</P>
<P>Good heaven, what a tran&s;ition did this event make in my life!&mdash;habituated to &s;lavery&mdash;accu&s;tomed to &s;uppo&s;e Lord Arlington de&s;tined to &s;urvive me, I be|held this incredible revolution with mute &s;urpri&s;e&mdash;the horror of his &s;ufferings gave way, when they cea&s;ed, to the &s;weet idea of liberty&mdash;liberty, &s;ighed out my weary heart, ah! to what purpo&s;e is mine now
<PB N="20" REF="23">
re&s;tored? I beheld my&s;elf in the &s;ituation of a criminal, who&s;e &s;hackles are &s;truck off only to launch him into the immen&s;e ocean in a little boat, without rudder, oars, or &s;u&s;tenance&mdash;where could I find a hope to re&s;t on? alone in the va&s;t uni|ver&s;e, I turned around in vain in &s;earch of one generous hand, who&s;e aid I might receive without fear or &s;hame.</P>
<P>The relation of Lord Arlington who &s;ucceeded to his title and e&s;tate was an illiterate rude &s;ea officer, whom his ill|ne&s;s alone had detained in England. He came on the news of his decea&s;e; e&s;cort|ing the late Lord's two &s;i&s;ters, to whom the per&s;onals were all devi&s;ed. I waited only the reading of the will to quit the melancholy man&s;ion I meant to abjure for the future.&mdash;Gracious heaven! how deep was my indignation and rage to find my&s;elf mentioned in it as an in&s;ane wretch to whom he bequeathed a mere maintenance, and left to be confined un|der the charge of his &s;i&s;ters in St. Vincent's Abbey, which as a purcha&s;e of his own,

de&s;cended to them! Never, in all the trials I had hitherto experienced, had I felt a tran&s;port like that this u&s;age exci|ted&mdash;to extend his tyranny beyond the grave!&mdash;Mean, execrable wretch! even at the moment I was exhau&s;ting the little con&s;titution his cruelty had left me in un|wearied attendance, deliberately to con|demn me to an impri&s;onment &s;o &s;hock|ing, and render it perpetual!&mdash;human nature could not re&s;i&s;t &s;o pungent a pang&mdash;it <HI>made</HI> the mi&s;ery it puni&s;hed; and I &s;unk into the dreary gulph once more from which I was lately emerging&mdash;my brain &s;till fires but to remember it.&mdash;Oh, my &s;i&s;ter! whatever the inflictions of your my&s;terious fate, tho&s;e of mine may &s;urely di&s;pute the woeful pre-emi|nence.</P>
<P>The overjoyed E&s;&s;ex di&s;patched an ex|pre&s;s, as &s;oon as the news of Lord Ar|lingtons death reached the Court, con|juring me to quit the melancholy pri&s;on I had &s;o long inhabited, and retire to a

&s;eat of Lord Southampton, in Here|ford&s;hire; whither that nobleman's bride would immediately repair to meet and com|fort me. Lady Southampton was the fair cou&s;in of Lord E&s;&s;ex, I formerly mentioned, who by marrying privately had wholly lo&s;t the favor of the Queen. The declining &s;tate of Lady E&s;&s;ex's health, he added, daily promi&s;ed him that freedom, made doubly de&s;irable now I had recovered mine. It had always been the intention of Lady Southampton to follow her Lord to Ireland; and he be&s;ought me to give him the &s;weet &s;atisfaction of know|ing I was &s;afe in the company and protec|tion of his cou&s;in, &s;olemnly promi&s;ing not to obtrude him&s;elf on me ere the laws of &s;ociety authorized the avowal of tho&s;e &s;entiments which had &s;o long lived in his heart.</P>
<P>The relations of Lord Arlington, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing by his will an ab&s;olute power, inter|cepted, and opened this Letter&mdash;far from pouring the balm it contained into my bleeding heart, they kept the dear te&s;ti|mony

of an unequalled attachment; and &s;ent back the me&s;&s;enger with the melan|choly news of my in&s;anity and confine|ment: but Lord E&s;&s;ex had been already duped, and could not ea&s;ily credit this in|formation. He deputed Henry Tracey, a young officer, much in his confidence, to a&s;certain my real &s;ituation; command|ing him not to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by any other mode of conviction than being admitted into my pre&s;ence.&mdash;Alas! ere this was re&s;olved on, re&s;entment had again fired my bewildered brain, and Lord Arling|ton had little to apprehend in allowing Tracey to enter my apartment. Buried in a profound &s;tupor, I replied not to his que&s;ti|ons, but drawing my mourning veil over my eyes, &s;at like a &s;elf-devoted Per&s;ian, the voluntary victim of de&s;pair. The faithful Tracey, &s;till fearful of being im|po&s;ed on, in&s;i&s;ted on having my picture, and a lock of my hair, to prove to his Lord it was indeed <HI>my&s;elf</HI> he had beheld in this deplorable &s;tate: he obtained this reque&s;t and departed.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="27">
But what became of E&s;&s;ex when Tra|cey returned with this melancholy con|firmation?&mdash;the te&s;timonials his confi|dante had brought, added force to the eternal pa&s;&s;ion of his &s;oul: a thou&s;and times he made Tracey de&s;cribe the apart|ment&mdash;my dre&s;s&mdash;my looks&mdash;and &s;ome|times fancying even that cautious friend had been deceived; at others, that the wretches in who&s;e power I was left, had, for the &s;hort period Tracey was permitted to behold me, &s;tupified my &s;en&s;es; he created a thou&s;and delu&s;ions to coun|teract the fearful impre&s;&s;ion of the truth.</P>
<P>Di&s;tracted with the&s;e ideas, Lord E&s;&s;ex fet out for Ireland, inve&s;ted with ab&s;olute powers, and heading an army attached to him alike by gratitude and expectation&mdash;he had not marched far ere he formed the bold re&s;olution of committing the con|duct of the troops to Lord Southampton, and turning off, he po&s;ted to St. Vincent's Abbey, determined to judge from his own &s;en&s;es of the &s;tate of mine: he ar|rived there at midnight, and requiring

This &s;urprizing effect of his pre|&s;ence would have per&s;uaded him that rea|&s;on had never de&s;erted me, had not my poor maids expre&s;&s;ed a joy at this unex|pected revolution too unfeigned to be mi&s;|con&s;trued; they intreated him to leave me time to &s;trengthen my faculties ere he again ab&s;orbed them, and he confined to

<P>Alithea, who had for years been my favorite attendant, informed him (as &s;oon as he could be per&s;uaded to withdraw, and leave me to repo&s;e) of the cruel and unju&s;t will, which, by rendering me a pri&s;oner for life, had occa&s;ioned this dreadful relap&s;e. His haughty &s;oul, neg|ligent at all times of prudence, and now perhaps of propriety, induced him to tell the Arlington family, that he would pe|ri&s;h ere I &s;hould again be left in their power: having planted &s;ome of his mo&s;t faithful dome&s;tics to guard my chamber door from every one but my own maids, he retired to the apartment allotted him, to meditate on the mode of proceeding lea&s;t likely to endanger my newly reco|vered intellects.</P>

<P>Provided with a fleet hor&s;e, I &s;et out to follow E&s;&s;ex, but &s;carce had I travelled a &s;ingle day, ere my &s;hattered con&s;titution (no longer able to &s;u&s;tain the lea&s;t toil) claimed two, to recover the fatigue of the fir&s;t. During my &s;tay at the inn, my

youth, the delicacy of my per&s;on and man|ners, with the air of re&s;erve I found it nece&s;|&s;ary to a&s;&s;ume, excited a curio&s;ity my libera|lity alone was able to bound; though even that gave ri&s;e to &s;u&s;picions almo&s;t equally dangerous. I began to fear my &s;cheme would wholly fail in the execution; I hired, however, two ru&s;tics well recom|mended, as a guide, and an e&s;cort; yet in travelling on the &s;olitary mountains of Wales, often dared not turn my head over my &s;houlder, left in my guards I &s;hould behold my murderers.

again&s;t the chance of my Lord's, be|ing informed of my &s;uppo&s;ed death ere I reached him. On enquiry, I plainly perceived he had left &s;pies in the neigh|bourhood of St. Vincent's Abbey when he quitted it, who, mi&s;led by report, had, ha&s;tened after him with news of the me|lancholy event. I learnt he had delayed cro&s;&s;ing from time to time without giving any rea&s;on for it, but on being rou&s;ed by the arrival of two officers, he ordered the &s;eamen to be called in the dead of night, and embarked the moment the tide fa|vored his departure.</P>
<P>Though this information left me only my&s;elf to reproach, it did not le&s;&s;en my chagrin. I wandered toward the &s;hore to meditate at lei&s;ure: it was &s;till littered with &s;oldiers and their appendages; they were indulging with ungoverned licence, in drinking and riot.&mdash;Every thing I beheld, increa&s;ed my fears of the voyage: it was in|deed a tremendous thought; to embark with a numerous body of licentious men for an unknown country, while wrapt in my&s;|tery

I turned woman again, and trembled at the bare idea. While irre&s;olute in what manner to di&s;po&s;e of my unfortunate &s;elf, I ob|&s;erved a body of travellers approaching, and under&s;tood with joy it was Lady Southampton and her train, e&s;corted by a cho&s;en troop, for whom tho&s;e I had already &s;een waited&mdash;I ble&s;t indulgent heaven, which thus relieved me from the effects of my own indi&s;cretion, and de|manded to &s;ee her&mdash;to &s;ee her was enough, for with the penetration natural to her &s;ex, &s;he in&s;tantly knew me, and throwing her arms round my neck, reproached me with a generous freedom for having re|tarded her journey, by obliging her to wait in vain for my arrival; and finally, for &s;hocking her with the fictitious &s;tory of my death.&mdash;I explained to her my un|guarded conduct, and its motives.&mdash;She

a&s;&s;ured me &s;he dreaded the effect it might have on my lover, as her Lord had not time to write more than that E&s;&s;ex was in de&s;pair for my lo&s;s, nor dared he ven|ture to leave him; therefore conjured her to confide her&s;elf to the care of the offi|cers he mentioned, and follow with all expedition.&mdash;This information doubled the regret which had already &s;eized on me; but to guard again&s;t all &s;u&s;picion and enquiry, I re&s;olved to retain my ma&s;|culine habit, and pa&s;s for one of Lady Southampton's pages, till &s;afely lodged in Ireland.</P>
<P>We arrived here la&s;t night, and found a letter from Lord Southampton, lament|ing the impo&s;&s;ibility of waiting for his Lady, without abandoning E&s;&s;ex to a grief which urged him to ra&s;hne&s;s and de&s;pair; he ended with conjuring her to remain in this town till, he had con&s;idered how to di&s;po&s;e of her &s;afely.&mdash;Oh, fortune, for|tune, how unfairly do we accu&s;e thee, when folly alone has led us into error!&mdash;I am more mi&s;erable than it is po&s;&s;ible to ex|pre&s;s.

Lady Southampton would fain per|&s;uade me this over&s;ight may eventually prove lucky, as it will prevent my again &s;eeing E&s;&s;ex ere the death of his Lady.&mdash;Ah! what alteration can her lo&s;s make in my fate? &mdash;"I tell you, my watchful friend, you cannot love my honor more than I do his &s;afety&mdash;between him and me there is another bar not le&s;s in&s;urmountable.&mdash;Did not my &s;i&s;ter's marriage with a fa|vorite of Elizabeth co&s;t him his life?

This country &s;o nearly allied to our own, yet offers to our view a kind of new world; divided into petty &s;tates, inve|terately hating each other, it knows not the benefit of &s;ociety, except when ne|ce&s;&s;ity combines the various parties again&s;t a common enemy; yet, though nece&s;&s;ity unites, it cannot blend them; the lea&s;t ce&s;&s;ation of general danger awakens all their narrow partialities and prejudices, which continually break out with bloody violence. The advantages of commerce, the charms of litera|ture, all the graces of civilization, which at once enrich the mind and form, the manners, are almo&s;t unknown to this people; with a &s;avage pride they fancy their very wants virtue, and owe to their poverty an unregulated valor, which often enables them to contend with well-di&s;ci|plined troops, whom they &s;ometimes de|feat by mere want of knowledge; at others, on the contrary, they ob&s;tinately pur&s;ue an unequal conte&s;t, while &s;peculating rea&s;on turns away from the bloody &s;cene, vainly con&s;cious that their mangled bodies &s;trew the earth, only becau&s;e no bene|volent

reviving once more, I ca&s;t my eyes round in &s;peechle&s;s a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;carce know|ing whether I &s;hould think my e&s;cape a ble&s;&s;ing. I was environed by a &s;et of beings who in complexion alone bore any re&s;emblance to my&s;elf, their language, manners, and lives, &s;eeming no more ana|logous, than tho&s;e of the inhabitants of the Torrid Zone. I laboured in vain to com|prehend them, or to make my&s;elf under|&s;tood, and was, in de&s;pair giving up the attempt, when the prie&s;t already menti|oned came to my relief. Through his means I informed them that the Lord De|puty would redeem me at any ran&s;om, provided they &s;ecured me from danger and in&s;ult. I &s;hould, I believe, have en|&s;ured my own &s;afety, had not the victo|rious party learnt, by &s;ome &s;traggler, that an Engli&s;h woman of di&s;tingui&s;hed rank had been di&s;covered among the &s;lain. They eagerly turned back to demand me, and the hope of reward alike influencing my pre&s;ervers to keep me in their hands, a di&s;pute no le&s;s fierce, though not &s;o

bloody, as that I had before witne&s;&s;ed, followed; it was too violent to be com|promi&s;ed, and at length, as the only way to prevent murder, both parties agreed I &s;hould be put into the hands of their General Tiroen; or, as &s;ome called him, O'Neal. Intreaties or re&s;i&s;tance would have been equally vain, and I was obliged to rejoice they thought me of con&s;equence enough to act &s;o honorably by me.</P>
<P>During this interval, one of the &s;er|vants deputed by Lady Southampton im|mediately to attend on me, having lin|gered a few minutes behind the Engli&s;h troop, followed to rejoin them at the mo|ment of the on&s;et; the &s;ound of the firing reached him ere he fell in with the &s;couts, and clapping &s;purs to his hor&s;e, he flew back to the village we all had lately quitted, there to wait in &s;afety the event of the conte&s;t: at this place he was informed, a band of rebels had i&s;&s;ued out from an ambu&s;cade formed in the neighbouring mountain; and while he was wavering what &s;tep to take, the
<PB N="62" REF="65">
news of my &s;ex and capture &s;uddenly reached him; &s;truck with the idea of &s;ome important my&s;tery, as well from my di&s;gui&s;e as the cautions of his Lady, he ha&s;tened back to her with the &s;trange in|telligence. The generous but timid Lady Southampton, impre&s;&s;ed &s;olely with the idea of my danger, wrote in&s;tantaneou&s;ly to E&s;&s;ex, briefly reciting all he did not know of my &s;tory, and &s;trongly conjuring him to exert his utmo&s;t influence to pre|&s;erve me from in&s;ult.</P>
<P>But who &s;hall paint the feelings of E&s;&s;ex, when the &s;urprizing intelligence fir&s;t reached him! intelligence which, in one moment, opened all tho&s;e &s;ources of tenderne&s;s in his &s;oul, grief and de&s;|pair had well nigh congealed. To think I &s;till lived would have been con&s;ummate happine&s;s, had I not been thus unaccount|ably &s;natched away, even at the very mo|ment of my miraculous renovation: &s;o &s;ingular a complication of events almo&s;t deprived him of his &s;en&s;es, and wrought impul&s;e up to agony.

untoward incident of my life was nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;ave his brain from partaking the di&s;tractions of his mind&mdash;&s;ick at the heart of an incurable &s;orrow&mdash;fatigued with the cares of government, and the &s;lavery of command, the news of my exi&s;tence and capture made him find in di&s;tinctions hitherto &s;o oppre&s;&s;ive, the &s;ole pro&s;pect of recovering a trea&s;ure, which, alone could give value to his future life.</P>
<P>From the knowledge acquired in his mili|tary command, E&s;&s;ex was enabled to decide on the character of Tiroen&mdash;he ju&s;tly be|lieved it unprincipled and ungovernable; how mu&s;t he tremble then to recollect my fate was in his hands! In a conjuncture &s;o dangerous, he re&s;igned him&s;elf entirely up to the guidance of an impa&s;&s;ioned heart, and di&s;patched an officer of rank, charging the arch-rebel by the blood of thousands yet un&s;pilt, not to exa&s;perate the Engli&s;h, and him&s;elf in particular, by maltreating the lady fortune had thrown into his power; for who&s;e ran&s;om any

&s;um was tendered her captors &s;hould de|mand.</P>
<P>This ra&s;h and impetuous addre&s;s had con&s;equences only le&s;s dangerous than tho&s;e it guarded again&s;t.

<P>It was not till &s;everal of the&s;e me&s;&s;ages had pa&s;&s;ed, that Tiroen's curio&s;ity led him to vi&s;it me: the attention excited by my ma&s;culine habit had led me imme|diately to reque&s;t one more &s;uited to my &s;ex; and the delicate &s;ituation I &s;tood in, obliging me to conduct my&s;elf with the utmo&s;t caution, I had thought it pe|culiarly fortunate to e&s;cape the notice of the General.</P>

to the cau&s;e they had e&s;pou&s;ed, as to &s;ecure their conduct from too &s;trict a &s;crutiny.</P>
<P>Tiroen &s;ought occa&s;ions to break off, renew, and prolong, the &s;ecret intercour&s;e in which he had now engaged with E&s;&s;ex; but a lingering treaty agreed not with the fiery impatience of that unfortunate hero.

<P>The amiable Lady Southampton came at the in&s;tance of her cou&s;in, and gave by her pre&s;ence, a decorum to my &s;itu|ation it had long wanted. Every effort of art was exerted to &s;oothe my broken &s;pirits, and &s;trengthen my exhau&s;ted frame. He, who alone could give effi|cacy to medicine, hovered ever near, and when &s;peech was interdicted, by affec|tionate looks &s;u&s;tained me.&mdash;Ah, how plea&s;ant were even the&s;e &s;ufferings! how &s;weet was it to collect back into my heart tho&s;e gentle impul&s;es war and terror had driven from their home!&mdash;To affiance my &s;oul in &s;ilence to its only Lord, and to fancy whatever fate heaven &s;hould here|after ordain him, mine could no longer be divided from it.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as my amended health allowed, I entered into a detail of all that had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince Lord E&s;&s;ex left me at St.

Vincent's Abbey. He in return in|formed me, that the lethargy into which Tiroen was plunged by the laudanum I had &s;o ha&s;tily admini&s;tered, was very near being fatal to him, as the utmo&s;t effort of care and medicine could only pre&s;erve him the faculty of breathing; &s;ince to di&s;turb his deep and unwhole&s;ome &s;lumbers always threw him into a dan|gerous delirium. The courageous effort by which I had recovered my liberty, he added, had formed the whole conver&s;ation of both camps while my fate was yet un|certain. I ble&s;&s;ed the awful power who &s;aved me the guilt of murdering even a villain, and did not immediately remark that E&s;&s;ex gave me no farther informa|tion.</P>
<P>I &s;oon learnt from Lady Southampton the painful truths my Lord &s;ought to hide from me&mdash;that Elizabeth had ince&s;&s;antly urged him to pro&s;ecute a war which his fears for me had hitherto &s;u&s;pended; but finding at length that both in treaties and commands were lo&s;t upon him, &s;he grew cold and
<PB N="82" REF="85">
di&s;gu&s;ted. His friends in England had given him but too much rea&s;on to believe that his enemies were gradually acquiring the a&s;cendancy in her heart, he as gradually lo&s;t; &s;ince all her favours were now la|vi&s;hed on Sir Walter Raleigh, the hou&s;e of Cecil, and the Earl of Nottingham, a party who had long meditated the down|fall of E&s;&s;ex and Southampton, of which they now &s;poke as a certainty; and that even the common people beheld with di&s;content the &s;low progre&s;s of the war in Ireland, nor could E&s;&s;ex any longer depend upon popularity.</P>
<P>The unguarded friend who made me this recital, engro&s;&s;ed by her own &s;hare in it, forgot how it intere&s;ted me. I called to mind the information &s;ent by Tiroen to Elizabeth, which but too well accounted for the Queen's anger and di&s;gu&s;t, and conceived at once all its probable con&s;equences. E&s;&s;ex, unlike all other favorites, could never be brought to know any claim to &s;uperiority but merit&mdash;incapable of tho&s;e little arts
<PB N="83" REF="86">
by which meaner minds attach the in&s;idi|ous train of &s;ycophants a Court always abounds with; he had ever &s;corned a partial monopoly, and politic di&s;tribution, of po&s;ts and places.&mdash;The mercenary wretches who had bowed to him in vain, paid their court to his enemies with more &s;ucce&s;s, and in&s;tructed by them in every weakne&s;s of the favorite, were ever ready to &s;trengthen any prejudice the Queen might conceive again&s;t him. A thou&s;and fears incident to age and decaying power, were thus cheri&s;hed in her, which magnified by pa&s;&s;ions time it&s;elf could never allay, might perhaps &s;tamp the ba&s;e intelligence of Tiroen with the fatal authority of un|bia&s;&s;ed truth, and give to the inactivity of E&s;&s;ex, the appearance of trea&s;on.&mdash;Such a train of circum&s;tances could hardly &s;ail to &s;tagger a mind in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the noble&s;t and mo&s;t im|partial judgment; what then might we not fear from a Sovereign always influ|enced by prejudices each pa&s;&s;ing day &s;trengthened, as it in&s;en&s;ibly impaired her rea&s;on? Fortunately, by an extrava|

gance of dotage which almo&s;t puni&s;hed the errors of her youth, tho&s;e prejudices had hitherto united in his favour:&mdash;yet while I perceived but a &s;ingle chance again&s;t him, my &s;oul &s;hrunk from the idea of entru&s;ting his life with her.</P>
<P>To give Lord E&s;&s;ex the opportunity of vindicating him&s;elf to Elizabeth, I re|&s;olved to account for her conduct; and divulged to him the inadvertent acknow|ledgment made by Tiroen, during our la&s;t memorable interview, of his own perfidy and di&s;&s;imulation. A generous &s;carlet burnt on the cheek of E&s;&s;ex while he execrated the traitor; but &s;truck immediately with a full conviction of the con&s;equences that might re&s;ult from this ba&s;e intelligence, he formed the extraordinary re&s;olution, of returning to England to ju&s;tify his honor.</P>
<P>This determination no le&s;s &s;hocked than &s;urprized me; far from imagining my in|formation would lead to &s;o wild a pro|ject, I rather &s;uppo&s;ed it would &s;ugge&s;t to him the impo&s;&s;ibility of ever revi&s;iting En|gland, unle&s;s the reduction of Ul&s;ter was fully accompli&s;hed.&mdash;In truth, I dared

not confe&s;s my fears that even then to re|main with the army alone could en&s;ure his &s;afety.&mdash;Every rea&s;on I dur&s;t urge, or Southampton enforce, were in his judg|ment feebler than his own&mdash;his honor was piqued, and nothing could hinder him from vindicating it.&mdash;Per&s;uaded a &s;tep as bold as this, alone would convince Elizabeth of his innocence, and accu&s;|tomed to regain, whenever he appeared, that influence over her, his enemies had often encroached on in his ab&s;ence, he per&s;uaded him&s;elf he need only be &s;een to triumph, and concluded a truce, as the preliminary to his departure.</P>
<P>The pride of &s;ex, &s;en&s;ibility, and ho|nor, contended with the leading pa&s;&s;ion of my nature, and taught me to di&s;dain over-ruling him I could not convince:&mdash;neverthele&s;s, I almo&s;t &s;unk under the conflict.&mdash;The frightful &s;ituation in which I had been placed &s;ince my arrival in Ire|land, made me ob&s;tinately refu&s;e to con|tinue there, whenever E&s;&s;ex &s;hould leave it; and the curio&s;ity I had excited alike by my bold e&s;cape, and wound, made
<PB N="86" REF="89">
it hazardous to commit me to the charge of any officer left behind. Surrounded with friends, relations, and dependents, E&s;&s;ex (&s;uch is the painful uncertainty ever attending on elevated rank) knew not one to whom he could &s;afely intru&s;t &s;o delicate a care. The generous South|ampton, determined to &s;hare the fate of his friend by accompanying him, propo&s;ed to unite that of his Lady with mine, by &s;hipping us off ere they embarked, with &s;ervants they &s;hould mutually &s;elect; ap|parently bound for France, but in fact for the coa&s;t of Cumberland. In the mo&s;t ro|mantic and &s;olitary part of that remote county, the Wriothe&s;leys had long owned a ca&s;tle, where malice it&s;elf would hardly &s;eek, and certainly never find us; there he a&s;&s;ured E&s;&s;ex we might repo&s;e in peace, till they &s;hould return again to Ireland. I felt all the merit of this project, by which the amiable Southampton robbed him&s;elf of the dear &s;ociety of his wife, merely to do honor to the beloved of his friend; and adopted it with the ut|mo&s;t

eagerne&s;s, from the hope that if the bu&s;y tran&s;mitters of Lord E&s;&s;ex's actions, had ever mentioned me, this total &s;epa|ration would extingui&s;h all jealou&s;y in the mind of Elizabeth; who I knew would much &s;ooner overlook the lo&s;s of an army than his heart.</P>
<P>Although E&s;&s;ex knew not how to place me happily in Ireland, it was with pain he con&s;ented to my quitting it; but find|ing me ob&s;tinately partial to Lord South|ampton's de&s;ign, he con&s;ented to my re|&s;uming my ma&s;culine di&s;gui&s;e, and &s;e|lected a ve&s;&s;el who&s;e captain was devoted to him, having ordered a lighter one to be prepared for him&s;elf.</P>

The killing remembrance which di&s;|tracted his mind, &s;oon rendered a malady &s;light at fir&s;t, de&s;perate; he was even given over; the Queen for a long time with&s;tood the accounts given by his friends of his &s;ituation, &s;o deeply had his enemies impre&s;&s;ed her with the idea that this was only a refined artifice to tempt her to humiliate her&s;elf.

Scarce was he ma&s;ter of the&s;e important particulars, ere the Laird of Dornock returned, and broke in upon us with an abruptne&s;s and anger he took no pains to di&s;gui&s;e.

I often fancied I read murder written in dark, but legible lines, on the knit brow of our ho&s;t; and though Tracey &s;lept only in an outer chamber clo&s;e by us, &s;carce could I per&s;uade my&s;elf he was &s;uffer|ed to re&s;t peaceably there, or yet lived for our protection: neverthele&s;s, I &s;trove at times to reject tho&s;e black chimeras a lively imagination perhaps too readily adopted;
<PB N="134" REF="137">
The Laird of Dornock no longer inter|fered with us, or our fate; neither did he withhold from us the company of his &s;i&s;ter.&mdash;That &s;weet girl, new to &s;ociety, with a romantic happine&s;s peculiar to youth, gifted every object with her own graces and virtues; impre&s;&s;ed at once with the merit of Tracey, &s;he transferred to a heart which could return it the pa&s;&s;ion I had unwarily in&s;pired, nor was her &s;econd choice unpropitious. Tracey, who&s;e &s;oul had expanded in a camp, was yet to learn the inconceivable charm of love: it took full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him. With a &s;weet; though &s;ad plea&s;ure, I witne&s;&s;ed pure and innocent vows, which continually reminded me of tho&s;e days, when like Phoebe, I looked enraptured on the varied land&s;cape of life, yet glow|ing with the early beams of hope; un|con&s;cious of the &s;howers which often would fall, the heavy nights which mu&s;t wholly ob&s;cure it. Tracey, no le&s;s de|lighted than his mi&s;tre&s;s, no longer ha&s;ten|ed his departure to England, and looked

a&s;toni&s;hed that we did not find every charm of exi&s;tence in this di&s;mal exile.</P>
<P>I, however, anxiou&s;ly waited with Lady Southampton, the day when her recovered health &s;hould enable us to de|part.&mdash;It came at length, and we were eagerly preparing for the voyage, when the Laird of Dornock &s;ent us an order to read, by which the King of Scots im|powered him to detain us. I know not any &s;hock of all fate had impo&s;ed on me, I ever felt more &s;en&s;ibly: neverthele&s;s, I had pre&s;ence of mind enough to ob|&s;erve, by the date of this order, that it had been obtained during the con&s;ine|ment of my friend. The di&s;appoint|ment and de&s;pair this incident occa&s;i|oned, was only alleviated by the recol|lection that in abu&s;ing the authority of the King, to indulge an unworthy incli|nation, the Laird of Dornock had made him&s;elf re&s;pon&s;ible to the laws of his country for our &s;afety, by admitting that &s;uch per&s;ons were in his cu&s;tody. Tra|cey gave him notice of this immediately; and though he moderated his rage in
<PB N="136" REF="139">
con&s;ideration of the fair Phoebe, he warned the Laird of Dornock to treat us nobly, as he would an&s;wer it to his own King, and the Queen of England, in who&s;e name we &s;hould &s;oon be demanded. To this indignant vaunt, for in truth it was no better, the haughty Scot coldly re|plied, "that he &s;hould take his chance of incurring an old woman's anger, who perhaps had already re&s;igned all her rights to his ma&s;ter." Tracey could no longer controul the feelings of his ge|nerous &s;oul, and replied with acrimony. The Laird of Dornock bad him profit by the occa&s;ion, and be gone immedi|ately, if he did not mean to be in|cluded among the pri&s;oners. There wanted only this &s;troke to con&s;ummate our wretchedne&s;s, and however reluc|tantly we lo&s;t our only friend and pro|tector, Lady Southampton joined me in arging him to go; and over-ruling all his objections, we ha&s;tened him alone into a bark, which an hour before we &s;eemed to &s;ee our&s;elves in. He comforted us
<PB N="137" REF="140">
with the a&s;&s;urance of &s;oon returning, be|ing fully per&s;uaded the King of Scots would never authorize &s;o unju&s;t and illegal a procedure, when once the whole cir|cum&s;tance was impartially &s;tated to him. I &s;ighed, at remembering I knew him bet|ter; but as an explanation at that mo|ment was vain, I urged not the un|bounded influence of the fair Mabel, through who&s;e illicit connection with the King, this order had doubtle&s;s been ob|tained. How &s;hould that Monarch be convinced of a remote act of inju&s;tice, who even at the moment of committing it, was wronging every moral and religi|ous duty? The man who once volunta|rily errs, mu&s;t either be weak or vicious; in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, he re&s;igns him&s;elf up to the pa&s;&s;ions of others, in the latter to his own; and in either ca&s;e &s;carce ever re|covers the narrow but even boundary of virtue.</P>
<P>It was not by &s;uch means I hoped for freedom&mdash;ah, no! myviews all pointed to she lover to whom my heart like the nee|dle

ever vibrated, though far divided.&mdash; Let E&s;&s;ex be once informed, &s;ighed I&mdash;let him once know where to find me, and he would cro&s;s the globe to en&s;ure my &s;afety. When the chagrin of this trying moment abated, I called to mind the infinite relief the vi&s;it of Tracey had given our &s;pirits, and the change it had made in our &s;ituation, by acquitting us of tho&s;e petty obligations which always humiliate a noble mind, unle&s;s it finds a congenial one in the be&s;tower.</P>
<P>I &s;oon ob&s;erved that the Laird of Dor|nock had not courage to profit by the ba&s;e inju&s;tice he had committed. The &s;ub&s;ervient &s;ituation Tracey placed him&s;elf in when we were pre&s;ent, and the profound deference with which he obeyed our every wi&s;h, neither agreeing with the rank we avowed, nor the regimental he wore, a vague idea of my&s;tery had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our ho&s;t's mind, which wanted vigor and activity to attempt developing it. Con&s;cious too late, that he had in relea&s;ing Tracey, &s;et a &s;py on his own
<PB N="139" REF="142">
conduct, he vainly regretted the timi|dity which prevented his detaining him. He neverthele&s;s, at intervals, &s;till talked of love to Lady Southampton, offering to buy a return by imaginary worlds of wealth: for to us, accu&s;tomed to elegance and luxury, all his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions appeared but a gaudy poverty. As the&s;e o&s;tenta|tious and ab&s;urd offers were one day made in my pre&s;ence, I could not but take &s;ome notice of them; he &s;ilenced me, however, by replying, I mu&s;t be cau|tious how I exerted a &s;pirit &s;o likely to make him transfer his attachment, and be &s;atisfied with protecting one of the two; &s;ince I could neither think &s;o ill of his di&s;cernment, or my own beauty, as to believe him the dupe of my di&s;gui&s;e. As it was the fir&s;t moment a doubt on the &s;ubject had ever tran&s;pired, my confu|&s;ion gave him in&s;tant conviction: I could not recover my&s;elf &s;ufficiently to reply for &s;ome moments: at length I told him he had gue&s;&s;ed the only part of our &s;ecret which did not lie too deep for his know|ledge;
<PB N="140" REF="143">
neverthele&s;s, all he had di&s;cover|ed, was but the lea&s;t part of the my&s;tery, and finally, that the day which informed him of our names and rank, would call him to a &s;evere account, if his conduct were in the lea&s;t unworthy either us or him|&s;elf.&mdash;I boldly affirmed, that the only thing wanting to our &s;afety, was, to have the Court of England informed of our a&s;y|&s;um, and now that was by Tracey's means a&s;certained, we were not without noble friends to claim us. The grandeur of air natural to me when in&s;ult rou&s;ed my pride, a&s;toni&s;hed and awed him&mdash;his mind laboured with vague and indi&s;tinct apprehen&s;ions; and as all attempts at diving into a &s;ecret locked up &s;olely in the hearts intere&s;ted in retaining it, mu&s;t be vain, he half repented having exerted an unju&s;tifiable influence, he could no longer hope to profit by.</P>

<P>Heartily weary of us both, I often thought the Laird of Dornock meditated propo&s;ing to relea&s;e us; and while I was one day in&s;en&s;ibly guiding him to that wi&s;hed-for point, an order from Court was delivered into his hand. Convinced it would liberate us, I ca&s;t an eye of tri|umph on him, while he opened it; and &s;aw his countenance confe&s;s the &s;ame idea; but a moment cau&s;ed a vi&s;ible change in it. He read the order aloud, and we found with inexpre&s;&s;ible a&s;toni&s;h|ment that it contained the &s;tricte&s;t charge to guard his Engli&s;h pri&s;oners, as he would an&s;wer it to his King: yet with all due deference.&mdash;I eagerly caught at this arti|cle without &s;eeming to notice the fir&s;t, which neverthele&s;s &s;unk deep into my heart; nor was his in&s;en&s;ible to the latter.&mdash;The wearine&s;s and di&s;gu&s;t he had begun to indulge, increa&s;ed; and his pride re|volting at the idea that his ca&s;tle was become a &s;tate pri&s;on, and him&s;elf only

a jailer, he felt every way irritated, hu|miliated, and offended. No human be|ing &s;ubmits to power with &s;o ill a grace as him who has unju&s;tifiably exerted it, and when its re&s;trictions fall heavily on &s;uch, mere retribution becomes in effect a &s;e|vere revenge.</P>
<P>A tedious interval had again clap&s;ed without any news from England. The tender, timid, Phoebe, often per&s;uaded her&s;elf her lover had never reached it; and the &s;ingularity of finding our&s;elves appa|rently forgotten, &s;ometimes inclined my friend and &s;elf to unite with her in that opinion&mdash;yet, how many other cau&s;es might we rea&s;onably a&s;&s;ign for it!&mdash;cau&s;es, &s;o much more afflicting, that we recalled our thoughts to the i&s;le for con|&s;olation.</P>
<P>Whether the infinite variety, the eter|nal tran&s;itions my own life had already afforded, inclined me to hope on; or, whether the ince&s;&s;ant prayers I addre&s;&s;ed to him who alone could relieve me, en|dued my mind with fortitude, I knew not; but, I certainly found in it re&s;ources

hitherto unknown. Every pa&s;&s;ing day &s;eemed to refine and &s;ettle its powers and perceptions, till tho&s;e turbulent pa&s;&s;ions which of late ru&s;hed like a cataract through my frame; now, with a gentle, health|ful, current, gave motion to my pul&s;es.</P>
<P>We learnt from Phoebe, that many letters came from Mabel to her elder brother, the contents of which he &s;o cau|tiou&s;ly concealed, as made it obvious we were their &s;ubject. This news only con|firmed us in the belief that Tracey had reached England &s;afely; and afforded us at the &s;ame time the flattering idea, that our friends were anxiously labouring to recover us; however their progre&s;s might be impeded by ob&s;tacles, we could nei|ther gue&s;s at, nor decide upon: nor were the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions vain. An order at length arrived, that we &s;hould be deli|vered to the officer who &s;hould pre&s;ent its counter-part. Oh, what joy, what gra|titude, what, anxiety, did this pro&s;pect of a deliverance afford us! From the dawn of the morning, till night black|ened the ocean, did one or the other

watch with eager expectation the pro|mi&s;ed ve&s;&s;el.&mdash;We beheld it at la&s;t, and hardly could E&s;&s;ex him&s;elf have been more welcome to my eyes.</P>
<P>Tracey once more landed, and glad was the greeting on all &s;ides.&mdash;He pre|&s;ented each of us letters&mdash;dear and precious characters! my &s;oul poured through my eyes when I again beheld them! With lavi&s;h tenderne&s;s E&s;&s;ex hailed my &s;econd re&s;urrection, and vowed to &s;hew his &s;en&s;e of the ble&s;&s;ing by an implicit &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to my will.&mdash;"You &s;hall no more complain of the terrors of a camp, my love, continued he, I turn for ever from the bloody &s;cene.&mdash;A court no lon|ger has any charms for me: in&s;pired with ju&s;ter &s;entiments, alive to purer plea&s;ures, in your heart and my own will I henceforth look for the wayward &s;traggler, happine&s;s.

<P>Tracey came fraught with gifts rather &s;uited to the &s;pirit of the donor, than that of the accepter, yet, they opened the heart of the Laird of Dornock, who li&s;tened to the avowal of Tracey's love without repugnance; and at length pro|mi&s;ed him his &s;i&s;ter, if, at the expiration of two years, his rank in the army en|titled him to claim her.&mdash;The tears of the young lovers for ever cemented tho&s;e vows his will thus authorized.

When this heart-breaking narrative came to my hands, I could not but ob|&s;erve that the &s;weet mi&s;tre&s;s of E&s;&s;ex had a very partial knowledge of his character, or information of his actions.&mdash;Ble&s;t with the mo&s;t equitable and generous heart that ever actuated a human bo&s;om, his virtues often took a fal&s;e colour from the &s;elfi&s;h views of tho&s;e who once found the way to it.

Neverthele&s;s, the early habits of power and di&s;tinction had &s;eized on his affections, and even his love co-operating with that indulged foible, they increa&s;ed together. The daring project he had formed, was

no way unfea&s;ible, had he managed it with addre&s;s; for he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the hearts of the whole kingdom, a few envious in|dividuals excepted.

Such a weakne&s;s alone could induce a &s;overeign, wi&s;e and experienced like Elizabeth, to delegate a power &s;carce inferior to her own, into the hands of a Nobleman, valiant, popular, and a&s;|piring.

The re&s;entment occa&s;ioned by the error of his conduct, was doubled when &s;he knew that of his heart: jealou&s;y took full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of hers, and &s;he determined to make him &s;everely &s;en&s;ible of her power: but &s;he was told it was not &s;afe, at that period, to recall him. Obliged for the fir&s;t time in her life to controul her&s;elf, and meditate how to get him again into her power, her temper became ab&s;olutely intolera|ble. Her Ladies per&s;erved a melancholy &s;ilence, &s;ave the artful few in&s;tructed to foment, and profit by, her irritated pa&s;|&s;ions. The fate of E&s;&s;ex &s;eemed wholly to depend on the event of a war, hitherto unpro&s;perous: when to the a&s;toni&s;hment alike of friends and enemies, without performing any con&s;iderable exploit which might &s;ecure him a welcome, the Earl po&s;ted &s;uddenly home, and pre&s;ented him&s;elf before Elizabeth, with the daunt|le&s;s air of unblemi&s;hed innocence. Whe|ther the &s;urprize of the moment really revived that powerful pa&s;&s;ion of which

They parted friends; and E&s;&s;ex in&s;tantly giving way to that credulity, which &s;o often made every talent art and nature could unite in his per&s;on, abortive, con&s;idered him&s;elf as effectually re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in her heart, and indulged all the exultation &s;uch a tri|umph over his enemies could not fail to occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>What a thunder-&s;troke then was his im|mediate di&s;grace! a di&s;grace he could not but impute to his own imprudence; &s;ince in returning without advice, he had deliver|ed him&s;elf voluntarily into the hands of his enemies. To the mortification of a long and humiliating impri&s;onment, was &s;hortly after &s;uperadded a killing grief, in the &s;uppo&s;ed lo&s;s of the beauteous Ellinor.

Re&s;igning him&s;elf to a &s;ullen and &s;ilent de&s;pair, he no longer conde&s;cended to offer Elizabeth any further vindication of his conduct, nor could be per&s;uaded to make the lea&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. This con|cu&s;&s;ion of feelings, however, &s;hivered his animal, no le&s;s than his mental, &s;y&s;|tem. A fever followed, which &s;oon ro&s;e to a dangerous height.

every argument, fear, pride, or prudence, could &s;ugge&s;t, was enforced to delay this interview.

As if actuated by &s;ome &s;ad pre-&s;enti|ment that he &s;hould never more re-vi&s;it this &s;pot, my Lord took great pains to familia|rize me to the management of the &s;prings, and gave into my hands duplicates of the

keys. By a &s;ingular chance amid&s;t all the tran&s;itions of my fate, the&s;e keys re|mained, and &s;eemed continually to re|mind me, how important to my daugh|ter's welfare it might one day be to re|cover the ca&s;kets.&mdash;A motive &s;trong as this alone could conquer the reluctance I felt again to behold a &s;pot &s;acred to the memory of a hu&s;band &s;o beloved. You will call this, perhaps, a childi&s;h weak|ne&s;s, after all I had borne; but alas, the mind feebler and feebler from every conflict, &s;ometimes &s;inks under a trifle, after repelling the more powerful attacks of ill-fortune with magnanimity.</P>
<P>Lady Arundel, with her u&s;ual kindne&s;s, propo&s;ed accompanying me; and we &s;or|rowfully mea&s;ured once more tho&s;e miles which &s;o &s;trongly revived in my mind the mo&s;t intere&s;ting remembrances. At Coven|try we re&s;ted to enquire into the character of the pre&s;ent owner of Kenilworth Ca&s;tle. We were told that this magnificent man|&s;ion I had left fit for the reception of a Sovereign, had long been in the hands
<PB N="201" REF="204">
of a mi&s;er, who&s;e avarice had induced him to &s;trip it of its princely ornaments: not le&s;s from the de&s;ire of converting tho&s;e into money, than to deprive it of every charm that might tempt the en|quiring traveller to knock at the inho&s;|pitable gate. Yet even when this ruin was effected, the &s;tructure it&s;elf was &s;o complete a piece of architecture, as to attract a number of unwelcome vi&s;itors; to exclude whom, he had now let it to &s;ome manufacturers, and re&s;ided him&s;elf in a remote apartment. The chagrin this extraordinary revolution could not but occa&s;ion in my mind, was increa&s;ed when I recollected how hard it would be, perhaps, to gain admi&s;&s;ion; and even when that was obtained, we knew not whether the only room I wi&s;hed to lodge in was now habitable. Lady Arundell, with her u&s;ual fore&s;ight, advi&s;ed me to &s;eem to have no other motive for this vi&s;it, than a de&s;ire to re-purcha&s;e the Ca&s;tle; and when &s;hewn through it, to appear to be &s;truck with &s;o &s;evere an in|di&s;po&s;ition, as &s;oon as I reached the

chamber which contained the cabinets, as &s;hould render it impo&s;&s;ible to remove me; leaving it to her to reconcile the owner to &s;o trouble&s;ome an intruder, by the mo&s;t lavi&s;h genero&s;ity. A fine&s;&s;e of this kind alone could a&s;certain me any &s;ucce&s;s, and the &s;ickline&s;s of my a&s;pect, I was &s;ure, would &s;ufficiently corroborate &s;uch an a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>We &s;et out immediately, that by ar|riving in the evening we might have a pretence for pa&s;&s;ing the night there.&mdash; My &s;oul turned from the well-known &s;cene, and &s;ickened alike at &s;ight of the reviving verdure, and the &s;plendid man|&s;ion, to me alas, only a gay mau&s;oleum. Humbly I &s;ollicited entrance at a gate which once flew open whenever I appear|ed; but, ah, though the exterior was the &s;ame, how &s;trange &s;eemed the alter|ation within!&mdash;No more did the liveried train of a&s;&s;iduous dome&s;tics a&s;&s;emble to the di&s;tant winding of the hunt&s;man's horn.&mdash;No longer did I re&s;t in gilded galleries, who&s;e pictured &s;ides delighted one &s;en&s;e, while their coolne&s;s refre&s;hed

A numerous body of diligent mechanics were plodding in tho&s;e halls were Eliza|beth had fea&s;ted, and their battered &s;ides hardly now informed us where the rich tape&s;try u&s;ed to hang. My ears were &s;ud|denly &s;tunned with the noi&s;e of a hundred looms; and the di&s;tant lake once covered with gay pageants, and re&s;ounding only to the voice of plea&s;ure, pre&s;ented us ano|ther &s;cene of indu&s;try not le&s;s bu&s;y, &s;trange, and &s;urprizing. By incidents of this kind, one becomes painfully and in&s;tantaneou&s;ly &s;en&s;ible of advancing into life. When fir&s;t we find our&s;elves &s;ailing with the imperceptible current of time, engro&s;&s;ed either by the danger of our &s;itu|ation, or enchanted with its pro&s;pects, we glide &s;wiftly on, &s;carce &s;en&s;ible of our progre&s;s, till the &s;tream revi&s;its &s;ome fa|vorite &s;pot: alas, &s;o vi&s;ible is the de&s;o|lation of the &s;horte&s;t interval, that we

<P>Among the few &s;ervants retained by the meagre ma&s;ter of this de&s;olated man|&s;ion, one appeared who immediately re|called him&s;elf to my mind by the name of Gabriel. I recollected his having been warden of the outer lodges. The title by which I was announced&mdash;the weed I &s;till continued to wear, overcame one already bowed to the earth by age, infir|mity, and penury: and when to the&s;e circum&s;tances was &s;uperadded the re|membrance of the plentiful and peaceful days he had known under a Lord ever munificent to his dome&s;tics, gratitude became agony, and the poor old man &s;unk in a fit at my feet. An incident like this might well have affected an indif|ferent &s;pectator.&mdash;I was &s;carce more &s;en|&s;ible than him&s;elf: and the alarm &s;oon &s;pread through the laborious mechanics, till it was conveyed to Sir Humphry Moreton.&mdash;Timorou&s;ly he emerged from
<PB N="205" REF="208">
his apartment, and as the humble croud made way for him, he mea&s;ured me afar off with his eye, and &s;eemed lo&s;t in conjecture on the &s;ubject of my vi&s;it.&mdash;My pur&s;e was yet in my hand, and part of its contents in tho&s;e of &s;ome per&s;ons who had lent a ready a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Whether this, or the wan delicacy of my looks intere&s;ted him, I know not; but every care-fur|rowed feature gradually relaxed as he ap|proached me, &s;triving in vain to &s;often into the &s;mile of benevolence. I ro&s;e to return his courteous &s;alutation, and in|formed him, that when la&s;t I pa&s;t the walls of this Ca&s;tle, I was its mi&s;tre&s;s, the dear and happy wife of Lord Leice&s;ter; but perceiving uncertain apprehen&s;ions of &s;ome remote claim began again to con|tract his brow, I added, that &s;en&s;ible I had lo&s;t every right in a &s;pot yet dear to me, I came to enquire whether he was di&s;po&s;ed to part with it, and to re&s;cue from po|verty &s;uch worthy &s;ervants of its late noble owner as had alike outlived their labour, and him who &s;hould have recompen&s;ed it.
<PB N="206" REF="209">
What heart is in&s;en&s;ible to that virtue in which we alone can re&s;emble our Maker?&mdash;Benevolence, like religion, awes even tho&s;e it cannot win. The mi&s;er loudly applauded my liberality; and by a greater effort on his part, al|lowing for the difference of our charac|ters, invited me to &s;pend the night in the Ca&s;tle. The chamber I had been accu&s;tomed to inhabit, he called his be&s;t, and thither was I conducted. I was not unprovided with the means of en&s;uring my own welcome, and my &s;ervants hav|ing &s;pread the cold viands we brought, Sir Humphry's &s;pirits grew light over luxuries he was not to pay for. A temp|tation &s;o agreeable prolonged his &s;tay, and I at length di&s;covered the only way to &s;horten his vi&s;it, would be to compli|ment him with all that remained: &s;ee|ing my &s;ervants in compliance with the hint, were about to convey it out of the room, fear le&s;t any &s;hould be lo&s;t by the way, prevailed over the hilarity

<P>With an impatient beating heart I rai&s;ed the tape&s;try, which providentially had been pre&s;erved in this room, le&s;s from its beauty than antiquity; as it was &s;o worn that it had long been pannelled in many places.&mdash;Behind the bed we di&s;covered the &s;ecret &s;pring of the cabinet, which I opened without any difficulty; and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Lady Arundell took down the well-remembered ca&s;kets, pau&s;|ing at intervals, to weep over all the tender ideas the &s;ight of them recalled &s;o forcibly to my memory; then rai&s;ing my eye toward Heaven, while devoutly thanking the God who thus pro&s;pered my remaining wi&s;hes, I almo&s;t fancied I beheld the bea|tified &s;pirit of him who concealed the&s;e trea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Lady Arundell would not re&s;t without in&s;pecting their contents. The large&s;t was filled with family papers, bonds, contracts, mortgages, many of which were to me unintelligible, and all u&s;ele&s;s.
<PB N="208" REF="211">
The next contained letters and little or|naments, le&s;s precious from their intrin|&s;ic value, than their analogy to particu|lar events.&mdash;Under the&s;e was a gilt ca&s;ket filled with jewels of great value, and what was of infinitely more, the authenti|cated bonds and acknowledgments of all the &s;ums Lord Leice&s;ter had informed me he had providentially depo&s;ited in other countries; and of which I knew not any memorandum remained. This was &s;o noble an addition to the beque&s;t which already enriched my &s;weet Mary, that it &s;eemed to me, her father even from the grave delighted to endow her: while the Almighty, gracious even when we think him mo&s;t &s;evere, had thu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;e|creted for her advantage, trea&s;ure it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for me to have pre&s;erved through &s;o many de&s;perate vici&s;&s;itudes.</P>
<P>The next ca&s;ket was a gift from the fond mother to the darling of her heart: it contained all the te&s;timonials of the Queen of Scots, and other parties con|cerned,
<PB N="209" REF="212">
on the &s;ubject of my birth, with the contract of marriage between Lord Leice&s;ter and my&s;elf. I felt rich in the&s;e recovered rights; and though prudence might never permit me to claim alliance with King James, yet to bequeath to my daughter the power of doing &s;o, at whatever period it &s;hould appear ad|vantageous, was a great con&s;olation to me.</P>
<P>Lady Arundell and I pa&s;t part of the night in packing the&s;e valuables in empty trunks brought for that purpo&s;e; then clo&s;ing the &s;ecret cabinet, and leaving no traces of our &s;earch for it, we retired to re&s;t. We departed early the next morning, carrying with us that ancient dome&s;tic of Lord Leice&s;ter, on whom me|mory had &s;o powerfully operated, and two others, who long &s;ince expelled from the Ca&s;tle, &s;ought a mi&s;erable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in the hamlets around it. It joyed my very heart to &s;upply to the&s;e poor wretches a lo&s;s irremediable with re&s;pect to my&s;elf, and the profound attachment of their

<P>Through the intervention of the friends I yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, &s;ome eminent merchants in London undertook to get the bonds, notes, &amp;c. duly acknowledged: and in proce&s;s of time, &s;uch con&s;iderable &s;ums were of con&s;equence recovered, as a&s;cer|tained to my&s;elf and child our accu&s;tomed affluence. Years and misfortune had only cemented the ancient friend&s;hip be|tween me and Lady Arundell.&mdash;I added my income and family to hers.&mdash;Her hou&s;e was fortunately &s;o near London, as to allow me the advantage of procur|ing the fir&s;t in&s;tructors for my daughter, and the infirm &s;tate of Lady Arundell's health, rendering her as much a pri&s;oner from nece&s;&s;ity, as I was from choice, both in&s;en&s;ibly found in the improve|ment of my daughter, a mild and grow|ing &s;atisfaction, which more than made amends for the world we &s;hut out.</P>
<P>Ah! could I de&s;ire a greater plea&s;ure? Pardon, madam, the fond extravagance

of maternal love, and allow me to pre|&s;ent to you the darling of my heart in her &s;ixteenth year. Already &s;omething taller than my&s;elf, to a form that united the &s;tricte&s;t &s;ymmetry with the wild and vari|able graces of glowing youth, my Mary added the perfect features of her father; exqui&s;itely feminized by a complexion tran&s;parently fair, and a bloom alike de|licate and vivid; her hair, of the golden brown I have de&s;cribed as peculiar to his, fell below her wai&s;t in a profu&s;ion of artle&s;s ringlets, heightening her beauty even to luxuriance.&mdash;If &s;he had borrowed any thing from me, it was the collected mode&s;ty of her mien; and from my &s;i&s;ter &s;he had &s;tolen that penetrating, fa&s;|cinating &s;mile, tho&s;e two alone of all I ever &s;aw were gifted with:&mdash;alas, it was now wholly her own.&mdash;Although light|ne&s;s and ela&s;ticity characterized her figure, every limb was rounded even to poli&s;h|ing, and never did I contemplate the &s;oft turn of her white arms when rai&s;ed to touch the lute, without thinking tho&s;e

Maternal ex|perience had moderated the enthu&s;ia&s;m incident to youth, nor was it obvious in any in&s;tance but the love of knowledge. Ince&s;&s;ant, unremitting, in her &s;tudies, books were her only extravagance, and mu&s;ick her only relaxation. To com|pen&s;ate for the worldly plea&s;ures I judged it prudence to deprive her of, I was lavi&s;h in indulgences to which her ta&s;te natu|rally led: I kept mu&s;icians on purpo&s;e to accompany her, and found in the years filled up by her&s;elf and her employ|ments, that &s;weet though &s;addened plea|sure parents only know, and which, perhaps, more than makes us amends for all the more lively ones it recalls to

The carriage &s;unk into a deep rut at la&s;t, and we were thrown out at a &s;mall di&s;tance, with a violence that al|mo&s;t deprived me of my &s;en&s;es:&mdash;my darling Mary had wholly lo&s;t hers.

I per|ceived with a &s;urprize even that mo|ment could not conquer, that on either hand &s;tood a young man, adorned with the order of the garter, and &s;o di&s;tin|gui&s;hingly hand&s;ome, that I knew not which was the Prince of Wales, but turned from the one to the other with an air of wildne&s;s and &s;tupor.&mdash;My looks, however, made little impre&s;&s;ion on the &s;trangers, their whole attention being fixed on the inanimate form of my daugh|ter.

&mdash;In truth, fortune had contrived to &s;hew her to the utmo&s;t advantage. I had thrown up her veil to give her air, and bared her beautiful hands and arms, poli&s;hed and white as Parian marble; the wild rings of her auburn hair played on her youthful face as the yellow leaves of Autumn curl over a later peach; whil&s;t every feature formed with a truth which might bear the nice&s;t examination, perhaps only appeared more exqui&s;itely regular from the ab&s;ence of expre&s;&s;ion; and even her figure and attitude (leaning on her mother's knees) pre&s;ented a perfect mo|del for a &s;culptor.

This addre&s;s a&s;certaining the Prince of Wales, he became the &s;ole object of my attention.&mdash;Ah, where &s;hall I find words to endear to you, Ma|dam, the royal youth my heart at once opened to adopt? Henry was yet but in the dawn of manhood, neverthele&s;s his height was maje&s;tic, and his figure fini&s;hed. The beauty of his features was their lea&s;t charm&mdash;virtue her&s;elf &s;eemed to &s;ublime every happy lineament, and &s;pare beholders the trouble of developing his character by conveying it in a glance. His manly voice united the firmne&s;s of his own &s;ex, with the &s;en&s;ibility of ours. A confu&s;ion of &s;ad remembrances were at once pre&s;ented with him to my mind; and the admiration he excited

was &s;trangely blended with regret.&mdash;I forgot that he had addre&s;&s;ed me, and con|tinued to contemplate him in &s;ilence; ever and anon turning my &s;treaming eyes wildly from him to Heaven, even then, my dilating heart bids me add, &s;carce changing the object.

<P>The re&s;pect due to &s;trangers induced the Prince to conceal the curio&s;ity my conduct could not fail to excite, but hav|ing informed him&s;elf from the attendants of my title, he addre&s;&s;ed me by it, and in&s;i&s;ted on conducting me home. I now under&s;tood the nobleman who had divid|ed my fir&s;t looks with the Prince, to be the Vi&s;count Roche&s;ter: that contemp|tible favorite of the King, celebrated only for his beauty.&mdash;The vi&s;ible coldne&s;s of my air checked a forward in&s;olence I ob&s;erved in him, and obliged him to quit us on our arriving at home.</P>
<P>With what &s;ecret tran&s;port did my &s;oul welcome a Stuart worthy that name, glo|rious for &s;o many ages!&mdash;The Prince &s;eemed delighted with his new acquaint|ances.&mdash;The &s;oft re&s;erve of my daugh|ter's air&mdash;the deepening ro&s;es of her cheek, and the low accent of her har|monious voice, when politene&s;s obliged her to an&s;wer the Prince, who&s;e ani|mated eyes reduced hers often to &s;eek the

<P>On this chance introduction was grounded an acquaintance a few days ripened into intimacy.&mdash;Led to di&s;tin|gui&s;h the Prince alike by his own merit, and the ties of blood, which &s;ecretly allied me to him, it was with the ten|dere&s;t &s;atisfaction I beheld him cheri&s;h the inclination he had already conceived for my daughter: yet the dignity of his mind forbidding him to form, an en|gagement he knew not how to fulfill, it was through me alone he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to her. Convinced it was in my power to prove her entitled even to &s;uch a lover, I &s;uffered fate to take its cour&s;e, attending only to prudences.</P>

His attendants, who &s;aw her regularly depart, were at a lo&s;s to imagine what could attach their royal ma&s;ter to the infirm widow of Lord Lei|ce&s;ter. The charm was in truth &s;imply affection.&mdash;The amiable Henry had early been accu&s;tomed to every kind of homage but that of the heart, and had too much &s;en&s;ibility not to feel the want he knew not how to &s;upply. Deeply &s;u&s;ceptible of the true regard I had conceived for him, impre&s;&s;ed at once by my mind, my manners, and my mien, with the idea of my&s;tery, and the de&s;ire of obtaining my confidence, it was only by his own candor he &s;ought to gain upon mine. Slowly and by degrees he deigned to re|po&s;e with me tho&s;e regrets and anxieties from which the utmo&s;t indulgence of na|ture and fortune cannot exempt a &s;ingle individual. He often lamented the dangerous di&s;tinction of being the fir&s;t|born

He had puni&s;hed him&s;elf, he added, for yielding to the&s;e impre&s;&s;i|ons by an ab&s;olute, obedience to his au|thority, but it was with grief he remem|bered that was now the only tye between them.&mdash;Nor would I wonder, he conti|nued, it &s;hould be &s;o, if I con&s;idered that, born as he was to imperial power, with an ardent pa&s;&s;ion for glory, he had hi|therto been &s;hut up in the narrow &s;phere of his own court, langui&s;hing away the

<P>While the admired Prince of Wales, the idol of the People, the heir of Em|pire, the endued of Heaven, thus con|fided to me the &s;imple and rational griefs which clouded a fortune &s;o brilliant, could I fail to meditate on the equality of providence?&mdash;Which graciou&s;ly allots even to the lowe&s;t &s;ituation, &s;ome portion of happine&s;s, and depre&s;&s;es the highe&s;t with the &s;ad &s;en&s;e of misfortune.</P>

The Prince had too much judgment not to &s;ee the utility of this council, and too much genero&s;ity not to value its can|dour: neverthele&s;s, it was a language yet new to his ears.&mdash;Ingenuity had been exhau&s;ted to teach him to govern others, but to &s;ubdue him&s;elf was a le&s;&s;on none had ventured to inculcate.

<P>The Prince could not be in&s;en&s;ible to the maternal caution which induced me to &s;end my daughter abroad whenever he honored me with a vi&s;it, yet the ob&s;erva|tion did not for &s;ome time appear to influ|ence his conduct.&mdash;Satisfied with merely beholding her as he entered or departed, the de&s;ire of opening his heart to me &s;eemed to &s;upercede every other impre&s;|&s;ion.

So pure a tran&s;port took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of mine, as obliterated every other impre&s;&s;ion. I &s;natched the united hands &s;o dear, &s;o be|loved, and pre&s;&s;ing them to my bo&s;om, &s;ickened with very exta&s;y, and withdrew to recover my&s;elf.&mdash;Wandering alone by

the &s;ide of the Thames, I rai&s;ed my full eyes to heaven; and called the happy &s;pirits of my mother, &s;i&s;ter, and Lord Leice&s;ter, to &s;ympathize with me in an event which promi&s;ed to end the per&s;ecu|tions of my family, by thus ble&s;&s;edly uniting the la&s;t &s;prung branches of it. A &s;erenity of the &s;ublime&s;t nature &s;ucceeded the &s;weet trouble of my &s;pirits, and ena|bled me to rejoin the youthful lovers with the dignity due to my own character.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation in which we &s;tood en|deared us &s;till more to the Prince, by per|petually reminding him how intimately our welfare was connected with his own. Every hour &s;eemed to unite us more and more to each other. Henry &s;poke to me with the freedom of a &s;on; conjuring me not to take any &s;tep that might create the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of my birth, or the &s;ecret tye formed between us, till he had well weighed every con&s;equence that might en&s;ue: and to elude the watchful &s;pies, with whom we were alike &s;urrounded, he propo&s;ed pa&s;&s;ing in the evening through his garden to ours, if I would deign for
<PB N="246" REF="249">
awhile to allow him thus to reach the &s;aloon. Our &s;ituation was too delicate not to require the &s;tricte&s;t caution, yet as I could di&s;cover no mode of receiving the Prince which was not equally que|&s;tionable, and more dangerous, I con|&s;ented to that he propo&s;ed: as well as that he &s;hould render one of his gentle|men (Sir David Murray) a confidante of this intimacy, though not of its nature, or extent.</P>
<P>An incident &s;o important engro&s;&s;ing my every thought, my heart returned once more eagerly into the world. It had now an intere&s;t in fully under&s;tanding the real characters of the King, the Queen, Vi&s;count Roche&s;ter, and every indivi|dual likely or intitled to interfere at this intere&s;ting cri&s;is.&mdash;I examined, con&s;i|dered, weighed every thing. I &s;oon di&s;|covered the whole Royal Family were at variance! That the imperious Queen, unable to wre&s;t her hu&s;band from his fa|vourites, or her &s;on from his duties, &s;corned the fir&s;t, and neglected the latter: confining her&s;elf wholly to a
<PB N="247" REF="250">
court formed of her own creatures, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted her to &s;poil her younger &s;on; whom &s;he had almost e&s;tranged from his brother. Her beautiful daughter who united in her own per&s;on the graces of Mary, with the &s;pirit of Elizabeth, alone allured to the court of the Queen the few per&s;ons of merit it afforded. Henry was often lavi&s;h in the prai&s;es of his &s;i&s;ter, and as &s;he was the only relation he ever voluntarily &s;poke of, I naturally conclud|ed &s;he was the only one entitled by &s;u|perior qualities to that di&s;tinction. King James, who had mounted the throne under happier au&s;pices than almo&s;t any preceding &s;overeign of England, had al|ready lived long enough to lo&s;e the affec|tions of his people. By turns a pedant and a buffoon, his &s;olemnity was even more di&s;gu&s;ting than his levity. Go|verned by a predilection of the mo&s;t ab|&s;urd and &s;ingular nature, to a beautiful favourite he always delivered up the reins of empire; readily &s;ubmitting to a &s;hame|ful &s;ubjection in all important points, provided he might enjoy a ridiculous &s;u|permacy

in his hours of indulgence and retirement. From &s;uch a weak and in|con&s;i&s;tent King, and his profligate Mi|ni&s;ters, the wi&s;e, the &s;cientific, and the good, had gradually retreated; and in neglect and &s;ilence contemplated from far the growth of that exemplary Prince, who promi&s;ed to retrieve the fame of his ance&s;tors, and the glory of the kingdom he was born to reign over. A youth of eighteen capable of uniting the unble|mi&s;hed virtues of that age, with the di&s;|cernment of a maturer one, was a phae|nomenon, and of cour&s;e either adored or dete&s;ted&mdash;While the body of the king|dom regarded him only with the fir&s;t &s;entiment, the worthle&s;s favorites of his father were actuated &s;olely by the latter.</P>
<P>To marry and e&s;cape the plans of Ro|che&s;ter was the intere&s;t of Henry; and to marry without his father's knowledge his unwilling choice.&mdash;Yet highly &s;en&s;ible of the &s;lavery impo&s;ed by his rank, he had re&s;i&s;ted every temptation from beau|ties of an inferior one:&mdash;but when ap|prized of my &s;tory, he &s;aw, or fancied he

&s;aw in my daughter, a wife alloted him by heaven&mdash;one to whom no ju&s;t objection could po&s;&s;ibly be made, one born to give happine&s;s to his heart, and honor to his name. Nor could he doubt, even if his father &s;hut his eyes again&s;t the truth, but that he &s;hould be able to convince the people of my birth, when the publica|tion of the marriage &s;hould give my &s;tory the whole weight of his credence.</P>
<P>Succe&s;s in his judgment depended &s;ole|ly on the concealment of the purpo&s;ed union till it could be accompli&s;hed; for if the intention tran&s;pired ere the event, he was &s;atisfied the mo&s;t de&s;perate efforts would be made to wre&s;t us from him. Yet as at this very period a publick treaty was negociating with a foreign Prince, he could not form a tye of &s;uch import|ance without giving his father ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence, the nation at large a contempt for his character, and the di&s;tant Sove|reign thus in&s;ulted, a mortal di&s;gu&s;t. We therefore agreed to wait till this Mini&s;te|rial project like many others &s;hould di&s;ap|point it&s;elf, and &s;eize that moment to
<PB N="250" REF="253">
celebrate and publi&s;h a marriage, which was to end all our fears, and complete all our hopes.</P>
<P>During this interval I ob&s;erved with pain that the extreme timidity of my daughter's character prevailed over the enthu&s;ia&s;m incident to her years; and damped with vague apprehen&s;ions tho&s;e moments love and hope might have made &s;o happy. I &s;aw this little feminine weak|ne&s;s with extreme unea&s;ine&s;s. The Prince of Wales was di&s;tingui&s;hed by a manly firmne&s;s, which ever wi&s;ely weighed the approaching trial, then calmly dared it. For a &s;oul &s;o noble, I de&s;ired to find a faultle&s;s bride; and looking fearfully into the future, I &s;ometimes thought my Ma|ry's timid heart would one day throb without cau&s;e again&s;t that of a &s;overeign oppre&s;&s;ed with innumerable cares, he perhaps &s;ought to lo&s;e the remembrance of, in her &s;ociety. Neverthele&s;s I did not perceive my tender admonitions on this &s;ubject, had any other con&s;equence than that of inducing my daughter to bury in her bo&s;om tho&s;e &s;entiments and emo|tions,
<PB N="251" REF="254">
I had &s;o many years delighted to participate.</P>
<P>It was now autumn!&mdash;The time of the King's periodical progre&s;&s;es.&mdash;The Prince could not avoid following his father, but he lingered in his duty; and having &s;taid a day too long with us, ha|&s;tened to overtake the King, whom he was to fea&s;t at Wood&s;tock. He wrote to me from thence, complaining of fatigue and la&s;&s;itude; but with his u&s;ual atten|tion, informed me he was in treaty for Kenilworth Ca&s;tle, where he flattered him&s;elf I &s;hould again &s;ee golden days like tho&s;e I &s;till remembered with &s;o much plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Alas, tho&s;e he had irradiated, were quickly ha&s;tening to a period! At the fir&s;t vi&s;it he paid me on his return, my &s;oul was &s;truck with a very apparent alteration in his per&s;on; which was grown thin and wan beyond conception, con&s;idering the &s;hortne&s;s of the time. Not all the joy he expre&s;&s;ed a our meeting could &s;atisfy me, he was ei|ther well or happy, but ob&s;erving he evaded my que&s;tion; and fearful of alarm|ing

<P>The evenings were now too &s;hort and damp for me to allow the evening vi&s;its of the Prince; and I rather cho&s;e to ri&s;que every danger by receiving him openly, than &s;ubject him to any by an ill-judged caution.&mdash;Alas, the&s;e cares were vain.&mdash;The rapid decay of the Royal Henry's health, became vi&s;ible even to indifferent &s;pectators. An affecting languor was the only expre&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e fine eyes once &s;o full of fire, and the youthful cheeks every following day &s;hould have tinged with a deeper bloom, grew more and more wan and hollow&mdash;He could no longer conceal his illne&s;s. Alas! it pierced me to the &s;oul! I was mi&s;erable at remembering a charge &s;o precious, as his welfare &s;hould be com|mitted to &s;ervants of whatever denomi|nation.

<P>Either not convinced this &s;ecret malady was undermining his con&s;titution, or in|different to the event, the Prince &s;till con|tinued in the pur&s;uit of his u&s;ual athletic exerci&s;es and habits, till his &s;trength was wholly unequal to them. I once more per&s;uaded him to call in medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and he promi&s;ed to attend to him&s;elf as &s;oon as his &s;i&s;ter and the elector &s;hould depart.&mdash;Obliged to appear at the celebration of their marriage in London, he came to pay us a parting vi|&s;it.

His heart mi&s;&s;ed my daughter, who was gone abroad.&mdash;He &s;ighed, &s;unk into a little reverie, and breaking it, with a faint &s;mile, &s;aid, "he ought rather to congra|tulate him&s;elf on her ab&s;ence." He &s;ighed again, and after another pau&s;e, re&s;umed his di&s;cour&s;e in a low and broken voice.&mdash; "Mourn not thus, my mother (for I will &s;till give you a title you may ju&s;tly claim from her who bore me; &s;ince who ever loved me as you have done?)

<P>With his u&s;ual kind con&s;ideration, Henry wrote to me the next day, that he found him&s;elf better; and in the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing his &s;i&s;ter happy, felt reconciled to the impolitick match made for her.&mdash;He even a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the various fe&s;tivals with which the nuptials of the royal Eli|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">abeth were honored; but &s;carce were

Not daring to give free vent to my appre|hen&s;ions in the pre&s;ence of my daughter, I &s;trove with cold and watery &s;miles to flatter tho&s;e hopes in her heart my own had long rejected, and &s;aw with vain regret, the deep exce&s;&s;es of a &s;en&s;ibility I had laboured to excite and &s;trengthen.</P>
<P>What days, what nights of &s;adne&s;s and &s;u&s;pen&s;e were ours, while the unfortunate Henry was langui&s;hing away every vital power ere yet they had reached maturity!&mdash;Frequently delirious, our names e&s;|caped uncon&s;ciou&s;ly from tho&s;e lips, which at his lucid intervals, uttered only &s;ighs and groans.

"I could not feel ac|quitted to my&s;elf, madam, concluded the faithful Murray, were I to conceal this, nor dare I add a &s;urmi&s;e on &s;o delicate an occa&s;ion."</P>
<P>Ah; of what importance to us are all the late enquiries, the vague conjectures of James! cried I, folding my daughter to my bo&s;om, if heaven deprives us of his ine&s;timable &s;on, neither his love or his hatred can greatly affect us.&mdash;Beloved Mary&mdash;dear inheritor of misfortune!&mdash;widowed ere yet thou art a wife, a long ob&s;curity, a &s;olitary youth is all thy por|tion&mdash;a &s;orrow which can never end thy

I now determined to quit a country which had been the grave of a hope &s;o dear, and found my daughter en|tirely of my mind. In gratitude for the unwearied attention of Sir David Murray, I informed him "of my intention to re|tire into Flanders, not doubting but that the Hollanders would afford, an honor|able a&s;ylum to the widow and orphan of Lord Leice&s;ter.&mdash;I be&s;ought him to ac|cept a ring of con&s;iderable value in token of my deep &s;en&s;e of the generous attach|ment he had &s;hewn alike to my&s;elf, and that incomparable Prince who&s;e lo&s;s was ever pre&s;ent to my mind; and reque&s;ted

<P>As the privacy of the promi&s;ed au|dience enabled me to di&s;pen&s;e with form, I made no addition to my &s;ervants, nor any other alteration in the weeds I u&s;u|ally wore, than that of forming them to the model of my mother's dre&s;s; which ever rendered the likene&s;s I bore her from my very birth &s;triking and obvious.

he would &s;end for my&s;elf and my daugh|ter, and hoped by that time he &s;hould be able to a&s;certain the day for publi&s;hing my birth, with a due regard for his mo|ther's honor; after which he could gra|tify him&s;elf by e&s;tabli&s;hing me in a &s;itu|ation that &s;hould make me forget all my misfortunes."&mdash;Tho&s;e misfortunes were already forgotten in the unhoped-for tran|&s;ition in my fate. I took my leave with the profounde&s;t gratitude, burning with impatience to impart this ble&s;&s;ed news to my Mary; and as the King did not offer to return the papers, I thought it better to leave them in his hands, than confirm the doubt my long &s;ilence could not but give ri&s;e to in his mind, viz. that I wanted confidence in his ho|nor.</P>
<P>I ha&s;tened to Richmond, and commu|nicated this &s;urprizing, this happy event, to my darling girl.&mdash;A thou&s;and times I en&s;olded her to my delighted heart, and found every tran&s;port doubled in her participation. She tenderly entered into
<PB N="290" REF="293">
all my feelings, and &s;weetly &s;miled at the eagerne&s;s with which I &s;ought to adorn her for the next day's introduc|tion. Yet con&s;idering the King as the &s;lave of exterior, it was a material point to heighten her beauty by every adven|titious advantage. To pre&s;ent her in ab&s;olute black, was to recall the mo&s;t melancholy impre&s;&s;ions to the mind of James; I therefore re&s;olved to lighten her mourning with a fanciful elegance. I dre&s;t her in a ve&s;t of black velvet thrown back at the bo&s;om in the French &s;a&s;hion, with a &s;emicircle of rich lace points, which &s;hewed at once her grace|ful wai&s;t and che&s;t to the greate&s;t ad|vantage. Her petticoat was of white fattin, wrought in deep points round the bottom with black velvet, and richly &s;ringed with &s;ilver. A fuller coat and train of &s;ilver mu&s;lin wrought with black, &s;ell over the &s;attin one, and was looped up to the wai&s;t at regular di&s;tances by &s;trings of pearl, and dragged toward the bottom into points by the weight of
<PB N="291" REF="294">
rich black bugle ta&s;&s;els and ro&s;es of di|amonds. Full &s;leeves of the &s;ame &s;ilver mu&s;lin were braced round her arms to the elbow by &s;trings of jet, and ro&s;es of diamonds; and from thence they were bare, except for &s;imilar bracelets circling each wri&s;t. The rich profu&s;ion of her auburn hair, which fell in natural curls below her wai&s;t, required no ornament, but to avoid the affectation of &s;hewing it, &s;he wore a hat of white &s;attin with a narrow fringe of black bugles, and a waving plume of feathers. This &s;plendid dre&s;s, on which the legacies of both her father and Anana were di&s;played, by &s;ome peculiar happine&s;s, either in its make or mixture, became my Mary be|yond any I had ever &s;een her wear. The fond mother's heart anticipated the impre&s;&s;ion &s;he would infallibly make on her uncle, and drew from her heightened beauty the happie&s;t pre&s;ages.</P>
<P>Ah, who could have conjectured that this brilliance and parade were only de&s;|tined to forerun one of the mo&s;t di&s;mal
<PB N="292" REF="295">
moments of my life!&mdash;That an inhuman tyrant had delighted to employ the trembling hand of misfortune in decking a gaudy pageant, for her&s;elf eternally to mourn over!</P>
<P>At the appointed hour, a clo&s;e carriage came for us with due attendants, and as the King had de&s;ired me not to bring any of my own, I rigidly obeyed, nor even hinted whither I was going. They drove us a long way, while engro&s;&s;ed by medita|tions on the approaching interview, as well as concerning the dear creature by me, I hardly knew how the time pa&s;&s;ed. My daughter at length ob&s;erved it was farther than &s;he expected.&mdash;I looked out, but it was too dark for me to di&s;tingui&s;h any object, and all I could di&s;cern was an increa&s;e of attendants. I called out aloud, and one drew near, who to my enquiries re&s;pectfully replied, that the King had been detained in London, whi|ther they were ha&s;tening by his orders. This information quieted us again; and I &s;trove to recall my fluttered &s;pirits
<PB N="293" REF="296">
into their u&s;ual channel, by turning the conver&s;ation on our future pro&s;pects. Neverthele&s;s, we went at &s;o great a rate, that I thought it impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould not be near London, when all at once I found we were driving through an un|known village. The &s;urprize this oc|ea&s;ioned, was doubled by my daugh|ter's throwing her&s;elf into my arms.&mdash;It was not immediately I could compre|hend her, when &s;he told me that a light which gleamed from the window of a cottage, had &s;hewn her that we were en|vironed with armed &s;oldiers. From this alarm we were not yet recovered, when by a &s;udden ri&s;e, and hollow &s;ound, we perceived we had pa&s;&s;ed over a draw|bridge; immediately after which we &s;topped. As we alighted, I ca&s;t my eyes round a large and dreary court-yard, where a few &s;traggling centinels were planted, but neither lights, &s;plendor, or attendants, indicated a royal gue&s;t, or a favorite's re&s;idence. The gloomy pa&s;|&s;ages through which we were u&s;hered,

I gazed at her with a vacant air, but na|ture re&s;umed her rights, and fondly plucking at my heart, the tears I re|fu&s;ed

Surely tho&s;e maternal tears alone pre|&s;erved my &s;en&s;es at a juncture when every thing con&s;pired to un&s;ettle them. My Mary, by an expre&s;&s;ive glance, reque&s;ted leave to open the packet, and &s;tarting at &s;ight of the paper it contained, put it eagerly into my hand; a glance inform|ed me it was that defamatory declaration the crafty Burleigh had deceived my &s;i&s;|ter into &s;igning while a pri&s;oner in St. Vincent's Abbey. The King, in &s;ending this, only added in&s;ult to injury, &s;ince the te&s;timonials I had delivered to him might have invalidated a thou&s;and &s;uch vague and artificial fal&s;hoods; yet had it a fortunate effect, for nothing le&s;s could have rou&s;ed my &s;pirits from the cold and &s;ullen torpor which every pa&s;&s;|ing moment &s;eemed to increa&s;e&mdash;"In&s;o|lent Barbarian! exclaimed I, not con|tent to impri&s;on the unhappy offspring of the Queen who had the misfortune of giving thee being, do&s;t thou delight in

I now recollected that by a fond va|nity in decking my daughter in all her valuable diamonds, I had inadvertently provided ample means to buy the fide|lity of our keepers; nor were they aware of our trea&s;ure, as the &s;everity of the weather had made me wrap her in a long cloak lined with fur. I ha&s;tily &s;tripped her co&s;tly dre&s;s of its riche&s;t embelli&s;h|ments, and &s;ecreted them.

<P>Scarce had we executed this prudent re&s;olve, ere the man I have mentioned pre&s;ented him&s;elf once more;&mdash;he was young&mdash;not unplea&s;ing&mdash;had an air of integrity, and profound re&s;pect, that a little prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me in his favour, even under all the di&s;advantages attending our meeting.

He then produced &s;ome keys which opened double doors at the farther end of the large room we were in, and conducted us into a chamber neat and commo|dious enough.&mdash;The keys, he informed us, were committed &s;olely to his charge; and that whenever, inclination or con|venience induced us to change our apartment, we had only to touch a &s;pring he pointed out, when he would attend, and unlock the intermediate doors.&mdash;The purport of this extreme caution was very obvious; it excluded every po&s;&s;ibility of winning over a female &s;ervant, as all the dome&s;tic offices would now of cour&s;e be performed in either room while we occu|pied the other; nor was he &s;uffered to

&s;upply us pen, ink, or paper. As the conveniences of the&s;e apartments, and the air of re&s;pect in our guard, &s;hewed &s;ome attention had been paid to our wel|fare, as well as the mo&s;t judicious pre|cautions taken to prevent our enlarge|ment, I neither imputed the one or the other to the King, but rather both to his cunning favorite. Our enquiries were in|terrupted by the entrance of two &s;ervants, who &s;et out an elegant &s;upper, of which neither my daughter or my&s;elf had &s;pi|rits to partake. Re&s;olved however to gather all I could from my attendant, ere another &s;hould be put in his place, or &s;u&s;picion make him dumb, I a&s;ked the name of the Ca&s;tle, and its owner; but to the&s;e que&s;tions he declared him|&s;elf enjoined to refu&s;e replying; never|thele&s;s, I conjectured from his looks that I did not err in &s;uppo&s;ing Somer&s;et di|rected him.

<P>In the gallery le&agrave;ding to our apart|ment, I ob&s;erved a centinel planted, from whom we were &s;hut by double doors &s;afely locked: perceiving we were thus effectually excluded from every hope, and chance of freedom, I de&s;ired to pa&s;s at once into a chamber, where I did not flatter my&s;elf I &s;hould find re&s;t.</P>

I did not &s;ubmit to bear this without demanding the autho|rity by which he acted?

Wearied out with this, another &s;uddenly came to my relief. Though yet early in the &s;pring, the weather was uncom|monly

beautiful, and the lenity with which we were treated, left me not with|out hopes of being allowed, under rigid limitations, the liberty of walking in whatever gardens the ca&s;tle-walls en|clo&s;ed. By this means I could examine the countenances of our centinels, and if I &s;aw one in whom humanity was not quite extinct, I thought I might find &s;ome means to &s;hew him a jewel; thus proving I could largely recompen&s;e him &s;hould he have the courage to a&s;&s;i&s;t us.

The&s;e re&s;trictions were as moderate as I could expect, and I eagerly prepared to profit by the granted permi&s;&s;ion, ere I ventured my daughter: certain I &s;hould at lea&s;t di&s;cover the &s;trength, heighth, and &s;ituation, of the Ca&s;tle.&mdash;Dunlop, followed by two other men, attended upon me. I ca&s;t an eager eye on the centinel on the gallery, but &s;aw in him no trace of &s;en&s;e, feeling, or curio|&s;ity. I found the little garden in &s;o an|tique a &s;tile, and ruinous a condition, as plainly proved this di&s;mantled build|ing was now only a pri&s;on, whatever its former di&s;tinction. The wall around it appeared decayed, and not very high&mdash;it looked down on a moat, apparently dry.&mdash;From one part of the terrace I caught the corner of a tower I fancied belonged to Wind&s;or Ca&s;tle, but dared not venture a word which might imply de&s;ign, and returned without a&s;king a &s;ingle que&s;tion.

<P>I now exerted every effort to gain upon Dunlop; but, too faithful to his execra|ble employers, I never won more from him than that my daughter was &s;till in the Ca&s;tle, not only unhurt, but treated with di&s;tinction and indulgence.&mdash;Yet, how could I credit &s;uch improbable a&s;|&s;urances? or even if they were true; ought not an indulgence &s;o partial to alarm more &s;trongly a mother's feelings?

ever anxious to compo&s;e my mind by re|iterated a&s;&s;urances of my poor girl's &s;afety, and as there was an air of candor in all he uttered, I began at length to conclude that the contemptible Somer&s;et had a&s;pired to the niece of his ma&s;ter, but from being already married to the divorced Counte&s;s of E&s;&s;ex, had not dared to avow his pa&s;&s;ion. I recollected too late the &s;ingularity of his being with Prince Henry when fir&s;t we beheld that amiable youth;&mdash;the a&s;&s;iduous re&s;pect he had &s;hewn in waiting on me at Richmond;&mdash;the affected offer of his intere&s;t with a tyrant who&s;e will he &s;o well knew how to make &s;ub&s;ervient to his own;&mdash;the com|bination of refined arts by which we had been led to throw our&s;elves into the pri|&s;on &s;elected for us;&mdash;and, finally, that the pri&s;on was probably a hou&s;e of his own.&mdash;Through the whole of this, as well as the manner we were guarded, there was a policy too minute for a King to plan, and too watchful to be the work of an indifferent per&s;on.&mdash;When by a ju&s;t turn of thought we in&s;en&s;ibly

unravel any hitherto inexplicable event, how does the mind di&s;dain its former blindne&s;s? I now con&s;idered with won|der my long want of per&s;picacity, and found &s;omething every moment to cor|roborate, and &s;trengthen the idea I had adopted.</P>
<P>To fix on any thing certain appears to the exhau&s;ted &s;oul a degree of relief; and though at &s;ome moments I dreaded art and violence might be employed, if gentle methods failed to undermine the virtue of my &s;weet girl, yet I much of|tener flattered my&s;elf &s;he could not in|&s;pire a pa&s;&s;ion &s;o gro&s;s and unworthy; and knew her &s;oul &s;uperior to every other &s;eduction. From the in&s;tant I ventured once more to hope, all my plans for e&s;cap|ing revived; I had no longer, it is true, the privilege of pa&s;&s;ing beyond my apart|ment, but mi&s;ery is ever ingenious, and I was pre-informed of the days when the compa&s;&s;ionate centinel guarded the door; nay, I fancied I often heard him draw near, attracted by my &s;ighs and groans.&mdash;The note I had formerly prepared was
<PB N="318" REF="321">
yet in being; I &s;ewed it to a long thin &s;lip of whalebone, and on the day when he u&s;ed to be attending, worked it gently under both doors, at a time when I judg|ed no other per&s;on near, and &s;oftly rapped at the inner one. A &s;weet hope rekindled in my heart as I felt it drawn out of my hand. I watched in vain the whole te|dious day for a reply, and often fancied my effort had been betrayed to Dunlop; but as I did not perceive any alteration in his countenance, I became rea&s;&s;ured; and concluded that the &s;oldier could not write, nor perhaps even read; and if &s;o, a whole week mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily elap&s;e ere I could learn his re&s;olutions. The ex|piration of that time verified my la&s;t con|jecture. With un&s;peakable &s;atisfaction I at la&s;t &s;aw a billet introduced into my &s;o|litude, by the &s;ame means I had &s;uc|ce&s;sfully ventured. I was a long time decy|phering the almo&s;t unintelligible &s;crawl: "I pity you, lady, from my heart, but I know not how to help you; it is true, you are rich, and I am very poor, but then it is impo&s;&s;ible to get at you; if
<PB N="319" REF="322">
you can think of any way, I am ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t." Ah, God! how did I lift up my eyes to thee, who had&s;t thus &s;trangely opened once more to me a communica|tion with that &s;ociety from which I had been &s;o unfairly wre&s;ted! In moments like this every thing appears po&s;&s;ible; al|ready I &s;eemed to &s;ee my pri&s;on gates open, my daughter in my arms, and our hone&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tant rich at once in our wealth and our ble&s;&s;ings. Having had the fore|&s;ight to prepare another billet, I convey|ed it in the &s;ame manner. "Worthy &s;oldier, is my daughter &s;afe, and yet in this Ca&s;tle? if &s;o, tear away all but the word, yes, and my &s;oul &s;hall for ever ble&s;s you." How pure was the joy with which I received the precious mono&s;yl|lable!</P>
<P>To prepare another billet, comprehend|ing my plan, was a work of time;&mdash;with what perturbation did I undertake it! To conden&s;e my meaning to a few words, and yet leave it obvious to a common capacity, was not an ea&s;y ta&s;k.&mdash;I thus
<PB N="320" REF="323">
at la&s;t effected it: "generous friend, win over him who guards my daughter's door, while you are at mine, and I will &s;hare with both of you the rich jewels I po&s;&s;e&s;s, of which you &s;aw only the &s;malle&s;t. Ob|serve the form of the keys Dunlop brings&mdash;buy many as near them as po&s;&s;ible, and &s;o various that &s;ome may certainly fit.&mdash;Procure likewi&s;e two regimental &s;uits, that we may pa&s;s the gate un|que&s;tioned; if you can rai&s;e the little money nece&s;&s;ary for this, fear not to &s;pend it; I will make your fortune in the mo|ment our doors are opened.&mdash;Re&s;tore me to my daughter&mdash;conduct us to the gate, and we will both be&s;eech the Almighty to ble&s;s the riches we will joyfully leave in your hands."</P>
<P>Having di&s;patched this, I waited the deciding hour with the mo&s;t anxious im|patience; and &s;carce dared to rai&s;e my eyes from the ground, le&s;t Dunlop &s;hould read in them aught that might alarm his &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="324">
How to di&s;po&s;e of my&s;elf, and daugh|ter, when out of the Ca&s;tle, was a que&s;|tion I could not decide upon; but I flat|tered my&s;elf that as we &s;hould have &s;ome hours &s;tart of our per&s;ecutors, we might reach London; where it would not be ea&s;y to apprehend per&s;ons who had been impri&s;oned without any judicial enquiry or &s;entence:&mdash;A greater fear however than that occurred.&mdash;How if the&s;e &s;ol|diers &s;hould not be hone&s;t&mdash;the reward we mu&s;t be&s;tow would prove what we po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, and our lives might be the forfeit. Yet &s;uch was my de&s;perate &s;tate, that even this rea&s;onable apprehen&s;ion did not in|duce me one moment to he&s;itate.</P>
<P>The appointed time revolved, and I re|ceived another billet. "Be ready when all is quiet&mdash;every thing is prepared if any of the keys fit. My comrade and &s;elf mu&s;t go with you to &s;ecure our own &s;afety, but it will likewi&s;e &s;ecure yours." Oh, how did my heart bound at this happy intelli|gence;&mdash;my languor, my lamene&s;s, all was forgotten. Maternal love, and ha|bitual
<PB N="322" REF="325">
fear, &s;eemed to wing me with &s;u|pernatural powers.</P>
<P>As the important moment approached, I knelt and devoutly invoked the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of heaven. Ah! not in vain; for the fir&s;t effort of the &s;oldiers was &s;ucce&s;sful. I reached out a rich and ready hand to each.&mdash;They received the contents with extreme &s;atisfaction, and conjuring me to pre&s;erve the mo&s;t, profound &s;ilence, lock|ed the doors, and led me to the further &s;ide of the Ca&s;tle. At the thre&s;hold of my daughter's apartment they gave into my hand the di&s;gui&s;es I had de&s;ired, and a|greed to wait till we were ready. The tender meltings Mothers only know thrill|ed thro' my heart, and &s;weetened every ap|prehen&s;ion, as I gently made my way thro' a dark room towards one where I &s;aw lights &s;till burning: but fearful of alarming my &s;weet girl, I he&s;itated at the door. What was my a&s;toni&s;hment to per|ceive that the apartment was gay, magni|ficient, and illuminated!&mdash;I thought at fir&s;t that anxiety had bewildered my faculties,
<PB N="323" REF="326">
but their truth became evident when they centred at once on my daughter; who, elegantly habited, had &s;unk on a couch a&s;leep. A writing table covered with due implements &s;tood before her, on which lay a letter, it appeared to me &s;he had been an&s;wering. The deadly cold|ne&s;s, the namele&s;s &s;en&s;ations this extraor|dinary &s;cene could not but occa&s;ion, at once &s;u&s;pended even the mo&s;t powerful emotions of nature. A repul&s;ion &s;o terri|ble obliged me to re&s;t my head again&s;t the pillar of the door, and &s;truggle &s;ome time with the &s;ickne&s;s and confu&s;ion of my &s;oul, ere I could gather &s;trength to penetrate into the fact. She &s;till continu|ed to enjoy a repo&s;e, it &s;eemed to me I never &s;hould know again, and I had now lo&s;t the wi&s;h of awakening her; of e&s;cap|ing&mdash;alas, even of exi&s;ting! Slowly at length I tottered toward the table, and catching at the two letters I mentioned, appeared to gra&s;p in them my very fate. The &s;ignature of the fir&s;t made its contents

ever veils its errors! I found him regu|larly informed of all our de&s;igns;&mdash;I knew it was in his power to cro&s;s them by a word; and I began to e&s;teem him for daring to be &s;ilent. During the la&s;t progre&s;s of the King, Somer&s;et re&s;olved to profit by the ab&s;ence of Henry, and, apprized of the interviews we granted the Prince in the pavilion in the garden, as well as of my habit of &s;itting there, determined to take the chance of plead|ing his cau&s;e. My &s;tay was by the ri&s;ing of the moon unu&s;ually prolonged on the evening he had &s;elected to pre&s;ent him&s;elf before me.

The Prince, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible di&s;may, en|tered the pavillion.&mdash;My voice had drawn him thither, but the &s;ound of Somer&s;et's made him retreat in contemptuous &s;ilence.

<P>Dear and lovely friend, you are now in England.&mdash;Already perhaps your feet have trod lightly over tho&s;e &s;pots where my happine&s;s withered.&mdash;Ah! if &s;en&s;i|bility &s;hould lead you more thought|fully to retrace them, check every pain|ful emotion, by recollecting I &s;hall then be pa&s;t the power of &s;uffering.&mdash;Yet, when your noble father reconducts you to the home you was born to embelli&s;h, grant a little to the weakne&s;s of mortality, and linger once more on the &s;pot where we met: the pious De Vere will there attend your coming.&mdash;Accept from his hand the ca&s;ket I bequeath, and &s;uffer him to lead you to the namele&s;s grave where he &s;hall have interred my a&s;hes: drop on it a few of tho&s;e holy tears with which virtue con&s;ecrates mi&s;|fortune; then rai&s;e your eyes with tho&s;e of your venerable conductor, and in a better world look for MATILDA.</P>
