<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_PART of this POEM had the Honour of your Lord&s;hip's Peru&s;al when in Manu&s;cript, and it was no &s;mall Pride to me, when it met with
<PB N="4" REF="4">
Approbation from &s;o di&s;tingui&s;h|ing a Judge: Should the re&s;t find the like Indulgence, I &s;hall have no Occa&s;ion (whatever its Succe&s;s may be in the World) to repent the Labour it has co&s;t me.&mdash;But my Intention is not to pur&s;ue a Di&s;cour&s;e on my own Performance; No, my Lord, it is to embrace this Opportunity of throwing out Sentiments that re|late to your Lord&s;hip's Goodne&s;s, the Genero&s;ity of which, give me Leave to &s;ay, I have greatly ex|perienc'd.</P>
<P>I offer it not as a new Remark, that Dependance on the Great, in former Times, generally ter|minated in Di&s;appointment; nay, even their Bounty (if it could be

called &s;uch) was in its very Na|ture ungenerous. It was, per|haps, with-held thro' an indolent, or wilful Neglect, 'till tho&s;e, who lingered in the Want of it, grew almo&s;t pa&s;t the Sen&s;e of Comfort. At length it came, too often, in a Manner, that half cancell'd the Obligation, and, perchance, mu&s;t have been acquired too by &s;ome previous Act of Guilt in the Re|ceiver, the Con&s;equence of which was Remor&s;e and Infamy.</P>
<P>But <HI>that I live,</HI> my Lord, is a Proof that Dependance on your Lord&s;hip, and the pre&s;ent Mini|&s;try, is an A&s;&s;urance of Succe&s;s. I am per&s;uaded Di&s;tre&s;s, in many other In&s;tances, affects your Soul with a Compa&s;&s;ion, that always

&s;hews it&s;elf in a manner mo&s;t hu|mane and active; that to forgive Injuries, and confer Benefits, is your Delight; and that to de&s;erve your Friend&s;hip is to de&s;erve the Countenance of the be&s;t of Men: To be admitted into the Honour of your Lord&s;hip's Conver&s;ation (permit me to &s;peak but Ju&s;tice) is to be elegantly introduced into the mo&s;t in&s;tructive, as well as entertaining, Parts of Literature; it is to be furni&s;h'd with the fine&s;t Ob&s;ervations upon human Na|ture, and to receive from the mo&s;t una&s;&s;uming, &s;weet, and winning Candour, the worthie&s;t and mo&s;t polite Maxims&mdash;Such as are always enforc'd by the Actions of your own Life. I could al&s;o take Notice of your many pub|lick-&s;pirited
<PB N="7" REF="7">
Services to your Country in Parliament, and your con&s;tant Attachment to Liberty, and the Royal, Illu&s;tri|ous Hou&s;e of our Mo&s;t <HI>Gracious Sovereign;</HI> But, my Lord, be|lieve me, your own Deeds are the noble&s;t and fitte&s;t Orators to &s;peak your Prai&s;e, and will elevate it far beyond the Power of a much abler Writer than I am.</P>
<P>I will therefore turn my View from your Lord&s;hip's Virtues to the kind Influence of them, which has been &s;o lately &s;hed upon me; and then, if my future Mo|rals and Writings &s;hall gain any Approbation from Men of Parts and Probity, I mu&s;t acknowledge all to be the Product of your
