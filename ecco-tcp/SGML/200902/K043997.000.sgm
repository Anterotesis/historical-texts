<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IF a variety of editions, and innumerable comments can be &s;uppo&s;ed to perfect and correct the inaccurate text of a celebrated au|thor, &s;ufficient, one would think, has been done to leave that of Shak&s;peare without a blemi&s;h. So &s;low, however, or &s;o inefficaci|ous, is the progre&s;s and exertion of verbal critici&s;m, when moiling in the du&s;t and cob|webs of antiquity, &s;o much is to be demo|li&s;hed, &s;o much to be rebuilt, that it will not, except to tho&s;e who place implicit confi|dence in the intere&s;ted and unqualifyed a&s;&s;er|tions of every publi&s;her, be a matter of much &s;urpri&s;e to learn, that, after all that has been done by the labour of Shak&s;peares numerous editors and commentators,&mdash;after all that has been urged or a&s;&s;umed in favour of the la&s;t
<PB N="ii" REF="3">edition, &mdash; as much more &s;till remains to be done to bring his text back even to the &s;tate of correct|ne&s;s in which it was left by his fir&s;t editors. A reader of he&s;itation and reflection will hear this with perfect calmne&s;s; he will be no &s;tranger to the fluctuating &s;tate of former editions; he will have noticed the boldne&s;s and a&s;&s;urance, the legislative and dictatorial manner in which every &s;ucceeding editor has u&s;hered his&s;elf into the world; and will not ea&s;yly forget the con|fidence of each in a&s;&s;uring the public that no|thing further could po&s;&s;ibly be done to his author:&mdash;Is not this the language of Rowe, and Pope, and Theobald, and Warburton, and Hanmer, and Capell? And where are they now? Where even dr. John&s;on and mr. Steevens may, in the cour&s;e of a few revolving years, be &s;ent to accompany them:&mdash;the re|gions of oblivion or disgrace.</P>
<P>The chief and fundamental bu&s;ine&s;s of an editor is carefully to collate the original and authentic editions of his author. It is other|wi&s;e impo&s;&s;ible for him to be certain that he is giving the genuine text, becau&s;e he does not know what that text is. There have been no le&s;s than eight profe&s;sed editors of Shak&s;peare; and
<PB N="iii" REF="4">yet the old copies, of which we have heard &s;o much, have never been collated by any one of them: no, not even either of the two fir&s;t folios, books indifferently common, and quoted by every body. And yet, &s;trange as it may &s;eem, not one of the eight but has taken the credit of, or actually a&s;&s;erted, his having collated them. One may be well al|lowed to pa&s;s by the preten&s;ions of tho&s;e prior to dr. John&s;on without particular notice; their fal&s;ehood is &s;ufficiently apparent in the margin of the late edition. Surely, men who thus proudly expo&s;e and &s;everely reprobate the crimes of their neighbours &s;hould effectually guard their&s;elves again&s;t &s;imilar accu&s;ations.</P>
<P>"I," &s;ays dr. John&s;on, "collated &s;uch co|pies as I could procure, and wi&s;hed for more
<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">(1) Preface, p. 59.</NOTE>:" "I collated ... all [the folios] at the beginning, but afterwards u&s;ed only the fir&s;t
<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">(2) Ibidem, p. 49.</NOTE>." He mu&s;t be very hardy, indeed, that dares give a flat contradiction to &s;uch po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertions as the&s;e from &s;o re&s;pectable a cha|racter. But the cau&s;e of Shak&s;peare and truth obliges one to &s;ay that the learned writer is certainly mistaken. The text of his own edi|tion,
<PB N="iv" REF="5">the notes of mr. Steevens, and, in &s;ome re&s;pect, the remarks in the following &s;heets, will prove that he never collated any one of the folios, &mdash;no not for a &s;ingle play,&mdash; or at lea&s;t that of his collations he has made little or no u&s;e. That he picked out a reading here and there from the old editions, is true: all his predece&s;&s;ors did the &s;ame: but this is not <HI>colla|tion.</HI> So much for dr. John&s;on.</P>
<P>With regard to the la&s;t edition, mr. Steevens explicitly tells us that "it has been con&s;tantly compared with the mo&s;t authentic copies, whe|ther collation was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;en&s;e, or not
<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">(3) Adverti&s;ement, p. 69.</NOTE>." "Would not any one, from this declaration," to u&s;e the ingenious critics own words, "&s;uppo&s;e that he had at lea&s;t <HI>compared</HI> the <HI>folios</HI> with each other
<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">(4) Ibidem, p. 68.</NOTE>?" But he has been deceived, no doubt, by the per&s;on employed in this laborious but nece&s;&s;ary work. What an abu&s;e of that confidence and credit which the public naturally place in an editor of rank and character, to tell them, that "by a diligent collation of all the old copies hi|therto discovered, and the judicious re&s;toration
<PB N="v" REF="6">of ancient readings, the text of this author &s;eems now finally &s;ettled
<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">(5) Malones preface to his Supplement.</NOTE>!" To what bet|ter cau&s;e can we a&s;cribe &s;uch unfounded a&s;|&s;ertions than to indolence and temerity? &s;ince, had the ingenious writer compared the old and pre&s;ent editions through a &s;ingle play, he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;aryly have perceived, that all the old copies had NOT been diligently collated, that ancient readings had NOT been judiciously re|&s;tored, and that the text is no more finally &s;ettled at pre&s;ent than it was in the time of Theobald, Hanmer, and Warburton: nay, that it is, at large, in the &s;ame &s;tate of inac|curacy and corruption in which it was left by mr. Rowe.</P>
<P>The&s;e, it may be objected, are merely nega|tive and unproved a&s;&s;ertions. It is very true. And they who do not think them confirmed in the cour&s;e of the following pages, and will not give their&s;elves the trouble to investigate their truth, are at liberty to disbelieve them. To publi&s;h the various readings of the old edi|tions would be a bu&s;yne&s;s of &s;ome labour, and little utility.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="7">
As to the notes and conjectures here offered to the public, very little need be &s;aid. Shak|&s;peare is <HI>the God of the writers idolatry,</HI> and &s;hould any one of the&s;e remarks be thought pertinent or u&s;eful in the opinion of a &s;ingle individual who, like him, admires the effu|&s;ions of this darling child of nature and fancy, whom, <HI>age cannot wither,</HI> and who&s;e <HI>infinite variety custom cannot &s;tale,</HI> it will be a &s;uffi|cient gratification to him for the pains be|&s;towed in drawing them up. And if there &s;hould be a future edition of this favourite, this inimitable author, the writer is not with|out vanity to hope that the following &s;heets may &s;timulate the editors care and attention to give his text with integrity, judgement, and cor|rectne&s;s, &mdash;
<Q><L>&mdash; a con&s;ummation</L>
<L>Devoutly to be wi&s;h'd;</L></Q> and, which mu&s;t of con&s;equence follow, to re|duce the number of exuberant and impertinent notes
<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">(6) From a republication of the la&s;t edition nothing is to be expected. The work will continue, like the editions of Warburton and Hanmer, to dishonour crit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, and to in&s;ult Shak&s;peare.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The freedom with which every editor has treated his predece&s;&s;ors precludes the nece&s;&s;ity
<PB N="vii" REF="8">of an apology for the liberties taken in the en|&s;uing pages, with the &s;entiments of &s;ome of our mo&s;t eminent literary characters. The &s;u|periority of a commentators rank, however, does not intitle his blunders to re&s;pect. It were to be wi&s;hed that dr. John&s;on had &s;hewn &s;omewhat le&s;s partiality to <HI>pride of place;</HI> for, though he profe&s;ses to have treated his prede|ce&s;&s;ors with candour, Theobald, the be&s;t of Shak&s;peares editors, experiences as much &s;cur|rility and injustice at his hands, as Hanmer and Warburton, the wor&s;t of them, do defe|rence and re&s;pect. For this, however, the learned critic might have his private rea&s;ons, which, as they could &s;carcely have justifyed his conduct, he did right to conceal.</P>
<P>To controvert the opinions, or disprove the a&s;&s;ertions of mr. Steevens, dr. Farmer and mr. Tyrwhitt, men no le&s;s remarkable for their learning and genius than for their obliging dispo&s;itions and amiable manners, has been a painful and odious ta&s;k. But whereever the writer has been under the nece&s;&s;ity of differing from any of the&s;e gentlemen either in point of opinion or in point of fact, he will not be
<PB N="viii" REF="9">found to have expre&s;sed his&s;elf in a manner incon&s;istent with a due &s;en&s;e of obligations and the profounde&s;t re&s;pect. Such, at lea&s;t, was his intention, &s;uch has been his endeavour, and &s;uch is his hope.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">(SHAKSPEARES WILL.)</HEAD>
<P>The &s;lighte&s;t alteration in the name of this great writer is a circum&s;tance of &s;o much importance to the public, that, although the editors may not have been too ha&s;ty in preferring SHAKSPEARE to SHAKESPEARE, it might be wi&s;hed that a more deci&s;ive and le&s;s equivocal au|thority than his WILL had been produced to justify and enforce the change. This will, it &s;hould &s;eem, the poet made in his la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s, when he appears to have been &s;o incapable of paying that attention to the writing of his name which a man in health u&s;ually does, that he has actually &s;ub&s;cribed it two different ways: SHAKSPERE, and SHAKSPEARE. So that we are &s;till uncertain which mode to adopt. How negligent, therefor, have the editors been, and how much are they to be blamed, for not procuring better and more po&s;itive evidence, if it were to be come at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="2" REF="11">it certainly was! Mr. Garrick, as they mu&s;t have known, though they did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to notice the fact, had then in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion a lea&s;e or mortgage from Shak&s;peare of a hou&s;e in Blackfriars, &s;ub&s;cribed (as we learn from mr. Colmans preface to Beaumont and Fletcher) with his own hand, WM. SHAKSPEARE; which, very luckyly, confirms the alteration made, with le&s;s authority, by the pre&s;ent editors. This deed was discovered among &s;ome old writings by mr. Wallis, of Norfolk-&s;treet, who pre&s;ented it to mr. Garrick, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of who&s;e widow it, mo&s;t probably, &s;till re|mains. Mr. Colman likewi&s;e informs us, that the name is, in the poets own county, pronounced with the fir&s;t <HI>a</HI> &s;hort
<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">(1) This pronunciation is right. Twice in the body of his will, and once in the margin,&mdash;that is, except the &s;ignatures, whereever his name occurs,&mdash; it is written SHACKSPEARE: and the in&s;trument it&s;elf is, by two different indor&s;ements, called MR. SHACKSPERES will.</NOTE>, and, in the register of Stratford church, uniformly entered SHAKSPERE.</P>

<P>One <HI>Hamlet</HI> (or <HI>Hamnet</HI>) Sadler, being a witne&s;s to, and mentioned in Shak&s;peares will, mr. Malone takes it for granted that he acquired this name from the testators tragedy of Ham|let; and thence infers, at lea&s;t gives it as one rea&s;on, that the play mu&s;t have been written in 1596; that he might be of what the critic thinks a competent age for a witne&s;s. In fact, however, the name of <HI>Hamlet</HI> was in common u&s;e long before Shak&s;peare was able to write a line; &s;o that the gentle|mans pre&s;umption mu&s;t, in this in&s;tance, nece&s;&s;aryly fall to the ground.</P>

<P>Whenever the <HI>Merry Wives of Wind&s;or</HI> may have been writt|en, it is certain, as well from the enquirers quotations and remarks, as from the play its &s;elf, that the time of action is in the reign of king Henry the fourth. But "if it &s;hould be placed," &s;ays he, "as dr. John&s;on ob&s;erves it &s;hould be read, between the <HI>Second part of K. Henry IV.</HI> and <HI>Henry V.</HI>" (where, however, it cannot be introduced without the mo&s;t flagrant impropriety) "it mu&s;t be remembered that mrs. Quickly, who is half-bawd, half-ho&s;te&s;s in <HI>K. Henry IV.</HI> is, in the <HI>Merry Wives of Wind&s;or,</HI> Dr. Caius's hou&s;ekeeper, and makes a decent appearance; and in <HI>K. Henry V.</HI> is Pi&s;tols wife, and dies in an ho&s;pital; a progre&s;&s;ion that is not very natural." It is &s;trange enough that the critic &s;hould not perceive that <HI>Dr. Caiuses hou&s;ekeeper</HI> and <HI>the land|lady of the Boars-head</HI> are totally di&s;tinct characters; and have not, if we except their name, &s;ex, &s;entiments, and loquacity, a &s;ingle circum&s;tance in common between them.

<P><HI>Re&s;embleth,</HI> mr. Tyrwhitt &s;ays, is here u&s;ed as a quadri|&s;yllable, as if it was written <HI>re&s;embeleth.</HI> And in &s;upport of this a&s;&s;ertion he in&s;tances the two following lines: the one from the <HI>Comedy of Errors,</HI> the other from <HI>As you like it:</HI>
<Q><L>And the&s;e two Dromios, one in <HI>&s;emblance.</HI></L>
<L>The parts and graces of the <HI>wre&s;tler.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>"And it &s;hould be ob&s;erved," continues he, "that Shake|&s;peare takes the &s;ame liberty with many other words, in
<PB N="7" REF="16">which <HI>l</HI> or <HI>r</HI> are [is] &s;ubjoined to another con&s;onant. See <HI>Com. of Errors:</HI>
<Q>"The&s;e are the parents to the&s;e <HI>children.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Steevens, in a note immediately preceding mr. Tyrwhitts, has ob&s;erved, that when a word was not long enough to complete the mea&s;ure, our early writers occa&s;io|nally extended it. Thus, &s;ays he, Spen&s;er in his <HI>Faery Queen:</HI>
<Q>"Formerly grounded, and fa&s;t <HI>&s;etteled.</HI>"</Q>
Again:
<Q><L>"The while &s;weet Zephirus loud <HI>whi&s;teled,</HI></L>
<L>"His treble, a &s;trange kind of harmony;</L>
<L>"Which Guyon's &s;en&s;es &s;oftly <HI>tickeled,</HI>" &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>From this practice, he &s;uppo&s;es, the author wrote <HI>re&s;em|beleth,</HI> which, though it affords no jingle, completes the ver&s;e. "The old ballad of <HI>Titus Andronicus,</HI>" adds he, "is written in this mea&s;ure, where the <HI>&s;econd</HI> and <HI>fourth</HI> lines <HI>only</HI> rhime." Whether this be a fact or not "let the fore&s;t judge." The ballad is printed by Percy, and begins thus: (the &s;tanza being the &s;ame throughout:)
<Q><L>You noble minds, and famous martiall wights,</L>
<L>That in defence of native country fights,</L>
<L>Give eare to me that ten yeeres fought for Rome,</L>
<L>Yet reapt di&s;grace at my returning home.</L></Q></P>
<P>There is much greater and more important matter i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the&s;e ob&s;ervations than either of the ingenious commenta|tors was aware of. Neither Shak&s;peare nor Spen&s;er ap|pears, from the above in&s;tances, at lea&s;t, to have taken the &s;malle&s;t liberty in extending his words: neither has the in|cident of <HI>l</HI> or <HI>r</HI> being &s;ubjoined to another con&s;onant any thing to do in the matter. But that great authors and great critics &s;hould not be better acquainted with the orthography and grammatical &s;tructure of their native tongue, is a circum|&s;tance which, if not to be wondered at, is, &s;urely, very much
<PB N="8" REF="17">to be regretted. The truth is, that <HI>every</HI> verb in the Engli&s;h lan|guage gains an <HI>additional &s;yllable</HI> by its termination in <HI>e&s;t, eth, ed, ing,</HI> or (when formed into a &s;ub&s;tantive) in <HI>er:</HI> and the above words, when rightly printed, are not onely unexception|able, but mo&s;t ju&s;t. Thus, <HI>re&s;emble</HI> makes <HI>re&s;emble-eth; wrestle, wrestle-er;</HI> and <HI>&s;ettle, whistle, tickle,</HI> make <HI>&s;ettle-ed, whistle-ed; tickle-ed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Semblance,</HI> indeed, cannot properly be written as three &s;yllables; neither, perhaps, is it altogether nece&s;&s;ary to pronounce it &s;o. <HI>Childeren,</HI> however, would be certainly right.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance of this &s;ort occurs in <HI>K. John:</HI>
<Q>That were <HI>embatteled</HI> and rank'd in Kent:</Q> which &s;hould now be written <HI>embattleed;</HI> though the verb was, probably enough, in Shak&s;peares time, u&s;ually &s;pelled <HI>embattel.</HI></P>
<P>Again, in Butlers panegyric on &s;ir John Denham:
<Q><L>No poet jeer'd for <HI>&s;cribbling</HI> ami&s;s,</L>
<L>With ver&s;es forty times more lewd than his.</L></Q></P>
<P>Here <HI>&s;cribbling</HI> &s;hould be printed <HI>&s;cribbleing:</HI> the metre evidently requiring three &s;yllables, which are nece&s;&s;aryly articulated in the pronunciation.</P>
<P>The&s;e ideas, had they been more germane to the object of the pre&s;ent &s;heets, or more likely to experience a favora|ble reception, might have been much expanded and further pur&s;ued; but, indeed, our orthographical &s;ystem is &s;o tho|roughly corrupted, and the principles and formation of the language are, even by tho&s;e who have profe&s;sedly treated the &s;ubject
<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">(2) John&s;on, Prie&s;tley, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>, &s;o little investigated or under&s;tood, that a writer, hardy enough to attempt a reform, will naturally expect to find many of his cleare&s;t axioms con&s;idered as the off&s;pring of &s;ingularity, affectation, and caprice.</P>

<P>This pa&s;&s;age, dr. John&s;on very gravely remarks, is much confu&s;ed, and of confu&s;ion, &s;ays he, the pre&s;ent reading makes no end. There is not, however, the lea&s;t room for altera|tion; Shak&s;peare has evidently intended to make hone&s;t Launce puzzle and confound his&s;elf in the arrangement of his <HI>dramatis per&s;onae;</HI> and, it &s;hould &s;eem, he has tolerably well &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>A &s;imilar thought, mr. Steevens ob&s;erves, occurs in a play of an <HI>elder</HI> date than this: <HI>A Chri&s;tian turn'd Turk,</HI> 1612. The <HI>Two Gentlemen of Verona</HI> is mentioned by Meres in 1598; and, in the opinion of mr. Malone, "bears &s;trong internal marks of an early compo&s;ition." He therefor refers it to the year 1593. Surely then the play quoted by mr. Steevens can hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed to be of an elder date.</P>

<P>The tail, &s;ays dr.

<P>But it does not appear that there either is, or could be any &s;uch regulation in the <HI>Fore&s;t-laws;</HI> as <HI>greyhounds,</HI> which alone would be disqualifyed by <HI>excauditation,</HI> could never have been the objects of laws made &s;olely for the pre|&s;ervation of the kings deer.

<P>As this is the fir&s;t <HI>clown</HI> who makes his appearance in the plays of our author, mr. Steevens thought it not ami&s;s, from a pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Tarltons News out of Pur|gatory,</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="26">to point out one of the ancient dre&s;ses appro|priated to the character.
<Q>&mdash; I &s;aw one actired in ru&s;&s;et, with a buttoned cap on his head, a great bag by his &s;ide and a &s;trong bat in his hand; &s;o artificially attired for a <HI>clowne,</HI> as I began to call Tarlton's wonted &s;hape to re|membrance.</Q></P>
<P>This may, probably enough, have been the dre&s;s ap|propriated to &s;uch a character as the <HI>clown</HI> or <HI>fool</HI> in <HI>As you like it, All's Well that Ends Well, Twelfth Night,</HI> and <HI>King Lear;</HI> but the clown of this play is a different per&s;onage, the tap&s;ter to a bawdy-hou&s;e, and re&s;embles the above cha|racter no more than <HI>Launce, Speed, Costard,</HI> or <HI>Launclot Gobbo,</HI> the note and quotation, therefor, which might had their u&s;e el&s;ewhere, are here certainly misplaced.</P>

</SP>
<P>This &s;peech, as mr. Steevens well ob&s;erves, is too inde|licate to be &s;poken concerning Juliet, before her face; for &s;he appears to be brought in with the re&s;t, though &s;he has nothing to &s;ay. The clown points her out as they enter; and yet, from Claudios telling Lucio <HI>that he knows the lady,</HI> &amp;c. one would think, he &s;ays, &s;he was not meant to have made her per&s;onal appearance upon the &s;tage.</P>
<P>That Julietta enters at the &s;ame time with Claudio;&mdash; that &s;he is not pre&s;ent during his conver&s;ation with Lucio; &mdash;and that &s;he is afterwards in the custody of the pro|vo&s;t;&mdash;are evident and certain. The little &s;eeming impro|priety there is will be entirely removed by &s;uppo&s;ing, that, when Claudio &s;tops to &s;peak to Lucio, the provo&s;ts officers depart with Julietta.</P>

<L>We have &s;trict &s;tatutes and mo&s;t biting laws,</L>
<L>Which for the&s;e <HI>nineteen years</HI> we have let &s;leep.</L>
</SP>
<P>It was <HI>fourteen years</HI> in all the editions prior to Theobald who made the alteration. The rea&s;on of which, he, in his note upon the place, &s;ays, will be obvious to him who recollects what the duke has &s;aid in a foregoing &s;cene. But the <HI>duke</HI> had not before uttered a &s;yllable about the matter; he mu&s;t therefor mean <HI>Claudio,</HI> who mentions
<Q><L>&mdash;the enrolled penalties</L>
<L>Which have, like un&s;cour'd armour, hung by the wall,</L>
<L>So long, that <HI>nineteen zodiacks</HI> have gone round,</L>
<L>And none of them been worn.</L></Q></P>
<P>Theobald &s;ays, the author could not &s;o disagree with him|&s;elf; and that it is nece&s;&s;ary to make the two accounts corre|&s;pond. But there is no rea&s;on to charge the author with incon|&s;istency, neither is it nece&s;&s;ary that the two &s;peakers &s;hould agree in their calculation. If it were, the dukes account &s;hould mo&s;t certainly be preferred, as he was doubtle&s;s much better acquainted with the exact time of the disu&s;e of tho&s;e laws than Claudio can be rea&s;onably &s;up|po&s;ed to have been. For, though he may not be too young a man to have a perfect recollection of the circum&s;tance, (and it &s;hould rather appear he is) yet it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved that he is <HI>about to &s;uffer</HI> by the <HI>revival</HI> of <HI>the&s;e very penalties,</HI> which, both his intere&s;t and inclination would naturally lead him to repre&s;ent as much more ob&s;olete than they ac|tually were. The old reading &s;hould, in all events, be re|&s;tored.</P>

<P>"This is an admirable &s;troke of humour: <HI>Dogberry</HI> &s;ays of the pri&s;oners that they are fal&s;e knaves, and from that denial of the charge, which one in his wits could not but be &s;uppo&s;ed to make, he infers a <HI>communication of coun&s;els,</HI> and records it in his examination as an <HI>evidence of their guilt."</HI> SIR J. HAWKINS.</P>
<P>It is with infinite reluctance that the writer finds his&s;elf obliged to differ in opinion from the learned magistrate, who, from his having &s;o long and &s;o ably pre&s;ided upon
<PB N="33" REF="42">&s;imilar occa&s;ions, mu&s;t, no doubt, be perfectly acquainted with the nature of a judicial proce&s;s.</P>
<P>That there is infinite humour in the pa&s;&s;age is very true; and that the ingenious commentator has not discovered it is equally &s;o; the &s;entiments and conduct of master Dogberry being the direct rever&s;e of what he &s;uppo&s;es them to be. We clearly perceive that in this examination Dog|berry takes all the precaution po&s;&s;ible to come at the truth; he charges them <HI>&s;everally</HI> with being <HI>fal&s;e knaves;</HI> he <HI>takes the utmo&s;t care</HI> that they &s;hall have <HI>no communication of coun&s;els,</HI> in order to concert a joint defence, by onely <HI>whi&s;pering</HI> to <HI>one,</HI> what he had before a&s;ked in the <HI>hearing of both;</HI> he is, therefore, a&s;toni&s;hed to find them <HI>both in a tale,</HI> and directs it to be recorded, as a proof of their <HI>innocence,&mdash;that they are no knaves:</HI>&mdash;becau&s;e they had <HI>both told him &s;o.</HI></P>
<P>This is the more evident from the behaviour of the &s;ex|ton; who, in mr. Steevenses opinion, and he &s;eems per|fectly right, &s;hews as <HI>much good &s;en&s;e</HI> on the occa&s;ion as any <HI>judge upon the bench</HI> could do, and who immediately tells Dogberry, that he <HI>goes not the way to examine,</HI> and that he mu&s;t <HI>call the watch,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>If the learned annotator will amend his comment, by omitting the word <HI>guilt,</HI> and in&s;erting the word <HI>innocence,</HI> it will (except as to the &s;uppo&s;ed inference of a communica|tion of coun&s;els which &s;hould be likewi&s;e omitted or cor|rected) be a ju&s;t and pertinent remark.</P>

<P>Pageant <HI>of the</HI> Nine Worthies.] This &s;ort of proce&s;&s;ion was the u&s;ual recreation of our ancestors at Chri&s;tmas, and other festive &s;ea&s;ons. Such things, being chiefly plotted and compo&s;ed by ignorant people, were &s;eldom com|mitted to writing, at lea&s;t with the view of pre&s;ervation, and are, of cour&s;e, rarely discovered in the re&s;earches of even the mo&s;t industrious antiquaries. And it is cer|tain that nothing of the kind (except the &s;peeches in this &s;cene, which were intended to burle&s;que them) ever ap|peared in print. The curious reader will not, therefor, be displea&s;ed to &s;ee a genuine &s;pecimen of the poetry and manner of this rude and ancient drama from an original manu&s;cript of Edward the Fourths time.

<P>"The &s;ettling commerce in Ru&s;&s;ia was, at that time, a matter that much ingro&s;sed the concern and conver&s;ation of the publick.

WARBURTON."</P>
<P>All this may be very true, but the learned commentator might have discovered that a ma&s;k of Muscovites was no un|common recreation at court long before our authors time. In the fir&s;t year of king Henry the eighth, at a banquet made for the foreign amba&s;&s;adors in the parliament chamber at We&s;tmin&s;ter, "came the lorde Henry, Erle of W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lt&s;hire,

<P><HI>Dr. Warburtons note upon the old Romances.]</HI> The learned prelate has received &s;uch a complete dre&s;sing, from the hand of a master, in the <HI>Supplement,</HI> that there is neither occa&s;ion nor opportunity for any further remark. At the foot of this page, however, there is a note, by the celebrated dr. Percy, which &s;eems to de&s;erve &s;ome little attention; and the more &s;o, as it is countenanced by the very ingenious gentleman alluded to, who has either not been aware of its fallacy, or, from private motives, forborn to expo&s;e it.</P>
<P>Dr. Warburton," &s;ays this redoubted critic, "is quite mis|taken in deriving Oliver from (Palmerin de) Oliva, which is utterly incompatible with the genius of the Spani&s;h lan|guage." So that, from his thus recurring to etymology, he clearly appears to be not a whit better acquainted with the history than dr. Warburton was. "The old ro|mance," continues he, "of which Oliver was the hero, is entitled in Spani&s;h, "Historias de los nobles Cavalleros Oliveros de Ca&s;tilla, y Artus de Algarbe, in fol. en Va|lladolid, 1501, in fol. en Sevilla, 1507;" and in French thus, "Hi&s;toire d'Olivier de Castille, &amp; Aitus d'Algarbe &s;on loyal compagnon, &amp; de Heleine, Fille au Roy d'An|gleterre,
<PB N="42" REF="51">&amp;c. tran&s;lat&eacute;e du Latin, par Phil. Camus, in fol. Gothique."</P>
<P>From &s;o much &s;eeming knowlege, from the annotators great credit, and from his very confident a&s;&s;ertions, who would be foreward to &s;u&s;pect his ignorance, or doubt his veracity? But it is even &s;o; he knows no more of the history which he quotes with &s;o much parade, than bi&s;hop Warburton knew of Amadis or Palmerin; with <HI>either of which</HI> the &s;tory of <HI>Oliver the Paladin</HI> has ju&s;t as much con|nection as it has with the history of <HI>Oliver of Castile and Arthur of Algarbe.</HI> With re&s;pect to the above French and Spani&s;h titles, they are literally tran&s;cribed from Fre&s;noy. And &s;o much for <HI>dr. Percys</HI> acquaintance with old ro|mances.</P>

<P>How others have misunder&s;tood Anthonios terms, does not by this edition appear, and it might be policy in dr.

Anthonio tells the duke, that, if he will abate the fine for the &s;tates half, he (An|thonio) will be contented to take the other, <HI>in tru&s;t,</HI> after Shylocks death, to render it to his daughters husband. That is, it was, during Shylocks life, to remain <HI>at intere&s;t</HI> in <HI>An|thonios</HI> hands, and <HI>Shylock</HI> was to enjoy the <HI>produce of it.</HI> The pre&s;ent reading is perfectly right, clear, and intelligible.

<P>The <HI>prince of Cumberland!</HI>&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<P>The crown of Scotland, mr. Steevens ob&s;erves, was originally not hereditary. When a &s;ucce&s;&s;or was declared in the life time of a king, (as was often the ca&s;e) the title of <HI>prince of Cumberland</HI> was immediately be&s;towed on him as the mark of his de&s;ignation.</P>
<P>The propriety of this note is not very apparent.</P>
<P>The crown of Scotland had been hereditary for ages before Duncan,&mdash;nay, from the very foundation of the Scoti&s;h monarchy. The <HI>apparent</HI> or <HI>pre&s;umptive heir</HI> was always the known and declared &s;ucce&s;&s;or; as in England and every other hereditary government. The kings <HI>elde&s;t &s;on,</HI> or grand&s;on (<HI>i. e.</HI> the heir apparent for the time being) alone was <HI>prince of Cumberland,</HI> as the king of Englands is prince of
<PB N="72" REF="81">Wales; or the king of France's, the Dauphin. And it &s;hould &s;eem, from the play, that Malcolm was the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> who had this title.</P>

<PB N="73" REF="82">authours &s;en&s;e, by the intru&s;ion of a remote and u&s;ele&s;s image into a &s;peech bur&s;ting from a man wholly po&s;&s;e&s;sed with his own pre&s;ent condition, and therefore not at lei&s;ure to explain his allu&s;ions to him&s;elf.

<P>This note, dr.

But there never was &s;urely &s;uch a number of words wa&s;ted to &s;uch an idle purpo&s;e. Whether Mac|beth would have made u&s;e of the image is not the question: the words are as evidently Shak&s;peares as any others in the play. And where was the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;o much <HI>learning</HI> to discover the allu&s;ion? The idea was per&s;ectly familiar to him.

<P>The meaning of this abrupt dialogue, dr.

<PB N="75" REF="84">&s;u&s;pects him of intending to betray them; the other ob|&s;erves, that, by his exact knowledge of <HI>what they were to do,</HI> he appears to be employed by Macbeth, and needs not be mistru&s;ted. A comment which there are &s;ew be&s;ides the learned author that would not have been a&s;hamed to re|peat.</P>
<P>In the preceding &s;cene, Macbeth &s;ays to the two fir&s;t murderers.
<Q><L>I will advi&s;e you where to plant your&s;elves;</L>
<L>Acquaint you with <HI>the</HI> perfect &s;py o'the time,</L>
<L>The moment on't.</L></Q> <HI>i. e.</HI> the very time when you are to look out for him. But dr. John&s;on has changed it to
<Q><HI>A</HI> perfect &s;py o'the time,</Q> and &s;eems too con&s;ident or too carele&s;s to perceive the ab|&s;urdity he introduces. For, if Macbeth had made the two fir&s;t murderers acquainted with this <HI>perfect &s;py</HI> of dr. John|&s;on, and they had received their directions from him, how could the fir&s;t murderer po&s;&s;ibly a&s;k him <HI>who</HI> bid him join them?&mdash;O, but, &s;ays the learned critic, he &s;u&s;pects him of an intention to betray them. Betray them! To whom? To Banquo? To be &s;ure they had wonderful cau&s;e to be afraid of one whom the king his&s;elf had appointed them to kill!&mdash;The fact plainly is, that this additional or &s;upernumerary villain is &s;ent from Mac|beth, by way of reinforcement, after the others had taken their &s;tand. He has told them that he was acquainted with the de&s;ign, but one of them, being unwilling, it &s;hould &s;eem, to admit a third to participate in the reward, and therefor de&s;irous to &s;huffle him off, very naturally a&s;ks, who bid <HI>him</HI> join them.</P>

<P>"It mu&s;t be owned," &s;ays dr. Warburton, "that Shak|&s;peare is often guilty of &s;ome &s;trange ab&s;urdities in point of history and chronology: yet here he has artfully avoided one. He had a mind to hint, that the cure of the <HI>evil</HI> was to de&s;cend to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in the royal line in compliment to James the fir&s;t. But the Con&s;e&s;&s;or was the fir&s;t who pre|tended to the gift: how then could it be at that time ge|nerally &s;poken of, that the gift was hereditary? this he has &s;olved by telling us that Edward had the gift of prophecy along with it."</P>

"The ingenious editor of the <HI>Hou&s;hold Book</HI> of <HI>the Fifth Earle of Northumberland,</HI> dr. Percy," adds mr.

<P>There may be a va&s;t fund of <HI>acutene&s;s,</HI> but there is not a tittle of <HI>truth</HI> or <HI>knowlege</HI> in this ingenious ob&s;ervation. It is &s;o well known that not onely the <HI>Tudor</HI> family, but their predece&s;&s;ors, for many ages, exerci&s;ed this real or imaginary power, that, in the reign of queen Elizabeth, who <HI>touched</HI> often, as any old history, and many other books, will inform us, one William Tooker, a learned divine, pub|li&s;hed a laborious Latin treati&s;e upon the &s;ubject, in which he enumerates a number of <HI>cures</HI> performed by that prince&s;s, and others of our ancient Engli&s;h monarchs
<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">(9) See much curious information on this &s;ubject in the reverend dr.

With re|&s;pect to dr. Warburton, one would be glad to know, how he became &s;o certain that Edward the Confe&s;&s;or was the fir&s;t who pretended to this gift. Shak&s;peare may be &s;ometimes chargeable with great ab&s;urdities, but he rarely, if ever, commits &s;uch a one as his over|learned commentator would here force upon him. If <HI>Edward the Con&s;e&s;&s;or</HI> had been the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Engli&s;h monarch po&s;&s;e&s;sed of this <HI>hereditary faculty,</HI> it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;aryly have <HI>dyed with him,</HI> for he not onely was a <HI>u&s;urper,</HI> but <HI>left no i&s;&s;ue.</HI> So that king James neither did, nor po&s;&s;ibly could either <HI>claim</HI> or <HI>get</HI> it from <HI>him.</HI> And his real titles were too

<Q>king James VI. thought it nece&s;&s;ary to form an act again&s;t &s;uperfluous banquetting.</Q></P>
<P>It is a pity that the ingenious commentator has omitted the very candid and liberal inference which the great tra|veler draws from the above circum&s;tance of the kail, <HI>i. e.</HI> that, "when they had not <HI>that,</HI> they had <HI>nothing."</HI></P>
<P>But under the favour of this ingenious critic, it does <HI>not appear:</HI>&mdash;dr. John&s;on, indeed, is plea&s;ed to <HI>&s;ay &s;o,</HI> and they who would have believed him if he had given a rela|tion
<PB N="79" REF="88">of his voyage into the moon, may, if they choo&s;e, believe this. It is very &s;eldom that we find people teach|ing to others arts of which they are ignorant their&s;elves, and yet this mu&s;t have been the ca&s;e with Cromwells &s;ol|diers; who were accustomed neither to eat kail, nor to wear brogues. The truth is, that both articles have, in all probability, been known to the Scoti&s;h ever &s;ince the country was inhabited.

But there is little room to doubt that the pau&s;es of action marked in the fir&s;t folio have been intended, or, at lea&s;t, approved by the au|thor. The player editors divided the different dramas ju&s;t as they were <HI>broken in the repre&s;entation.</HI> And, mo&s;t, if not all, of Shak&s;peares plays having been performed at his own theatre, and under his own eye, it is very improbable that he &s;hould not have given directions about the divi&s;ion of the acts. If there had been no distinction of acts in the playhou&s;e copies, me&s;&s;ieurs Hemings and Condell would never have troubled their heads about the matter.

<P>The fact is, that, in the folio, it is the <HI>duke of Exeter,</HI> and not Eluellen, who enters, and to whom Pistol addre&s;ses his&s;elf. Shak&s;peare had made the alteration, and the

<P>This change, according to dr. John&s;on, is rightly ad|mitted by bi&s;hop Warburton. Sir Thomas Hanmer, it &s;eems, reads:
<Q><L>&mdash; the oppo&s;ed numbers</L>
<L>Which &s;tand before them.</L></Q></P>
<P>This reading, dr. John&s;on &s;ays, he borrowed from the old quarto, which gives the pa&s;&s;age thus:
<Q><L>Take from them now the &s;en&s;e of reckoning,</L>
<L>That the oppo&s;ed multitudes that &s;tand before them</L>
<L>May not appall their courage.</L></Q></P>
<P>Mr. Tyrwhitt allows that Theobalds alteration makes a very good &s;en&s;e; but he thinks that we might read, with
<PB N="111" REF="120">le&s;s deviation from the old edition, what is adopted in the pre&s;ent text.</P>
<P>After all, the old reading appears to be right; though none of the commentators has attempted to explain it. The king prays that his men may be unable to reckon the enemys force; that their hearts (<HI>i. e.</HI> their &s;en&s;e and pa&s;|&s;ions) may be taken from them: <HI>that they may be as brave as a total ab&s;ence of all feeling and reflection can make them</HI>

<P>It is to be regretted that Shak&s;peare &s;hould have &s;o far fol|lowed the ab&s;urd and lying &s;tories of his time, about this celebrated heroine, whom the French called the maid of God, as to repre&s;ent her not onely a &s;trumpet, but a witch. If we may believe the mo&s;t authentic historians &s;he was no le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed for virtue than courage. She was burnt, indeed, by the barbarous Engli&s;h, whom &s;he had &s;o fre|quently driven before her, and who, to excu&s;e their want of courage or policy, and to justify their inhumanity, pre|tended that &s;he had dealt with the devil!

When the earl of Warwycke," adds he, "was informed of this &s;eate, he lyke a man de&s;perated, mounted on his hackeney, and came blowing to kyng Edwarde &s;aiyng: &s;yr I praye God haue mercy of their &s;oules, which in the beginning of your enterpri&s;e hath lo&s;t their lyfes, and becau&s;e I &s;e no &s;uccors of the world I remit the vengeaunce and puni&s;h|ment to God our creator and redenier, and with that lighted doune, and &s;lewe his hor&s;e with his &s;wourde, &s;aiyng: let them flye that wyl, for &s;urely I wil tary with him that wil tary with me, and ki&s;sed the cro&s;&s;e of his &s;wourde."

<P>Shak&s;peare is not &s;ingular in &s;uppo&s;ing Henry to be the true repre&s;entative of the line of Lancaster. The tyrannous and bloody dispo&s;ition of this monarch, and his immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;or (neither of whom was at all inferior in cruelty, and the fir&s;t of them far &s;uperior in craft and cunning to the mon&s;ter he dethroned), joined to the goodne&s;s of their title under the hou&s;e of York, made it un&s;afe, and perhaps unnece&s;&s;ary to canvas his de&s;cent. So that fear, flattery, neglect, and ignorance, &s;eem to have e&s;tabli&s;hed the opi|nion which mo&s;t of our historians, and people in general hold of Richmonds being what he here pretends to be.

<P>This is a &s;trange charge. If nature have denyed to this great critic the ordinary feelings of humanity, is he there|for to accu&s;e the poet? Surely, dr. John&s;on is the onely per&s;on living who would not be a&s;hamed to declare his&s;elf

<P>Mr. <HI>Seyward,</HI> &s;ays dr. John&s;on, in his preface to Beau|mont, has very elaborately endeavoured to prove that an <HI>arm-gaunt</HI> &s;teed is a &s;teed with <HI>lean-&s;houlders. Arm,</HI> adds he, is the Teutonic word for <HI>want,</HI> or <HI>poverty. "Arm gaunt</HI> may be therefore an old word, &s;ignifying <HI>lean</HI> for <HI>want,</HI> ill-fed. Edwards's ob&s;ervation, that a worn out hor&s;e is not proper for Atlas to mount in battle, is impertinent: the hor&s;e here mentioned &s;eems to be a po&s;t-hor&s;e, rather than a war|hor&s;e."</P>
<P>It is &s;omewhat remarkable that when this great critic is de&s;irous to introduce his own note on a pa&s;&s;age whereon a much better has been already written, he ge|nerally begins his ob&s;ervation by ridiculing that of his predece&s;&s;or. Mr. Seward, (not <HI>Seyward</HI> as dr. John|&s;on, mr. Steevens, and mr. Malone, have every where
<PB N="148" REF="157">throughout this edition corrupted his name) explains the word <HI>arm-gaunt</HI> by <HI>thin &s;houlders,</HI> which, he &s;ays, is known to be one of the principal beauties of a hor&s;e. And he adds that the epithet has, from the uncommon u&s;e of either part of the compound word in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en&s;e, an <HI>antique dignity</HI> and grandeur in &s;ound that poets much delight in. (The reader will ob&s;erve the difference between <HI>thin &s;houlders</HI> and <HI>lean &s;houlders;</HI> the former being a beauty, the latter a defect.) And this dr. John&s;on calls an <HI>elaborate endeavour to prove.</HI> Not recollecting that his own attempt is more elaborate, and much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s ingenious and &s;ucce&s;sful. <HI>Arm</HI> may be the Teu|toni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> word for want; and yet one would like to have &s;ome better proof of its exi&s;tence than the bare dictum of one &s;o little acquainted with ancient languages as dr. John&s;on is. And even when that is given we &s;hould &s;till be glad to know how Shak&s;peare came by it. Dr. John&s;ons ob&s;ervation that this &s;teed was a po&s;t hor&s;e is "impertinent;" as a po&s;t|hor&s;e would &s;careely have made any distinction between Antony and his groom: and yet the author repre&s;ents it &s;o proud of its burthen that its neigh &s;ilenced the by-&s;tanders.</P>

<P><HI>Scene II.</HI> &mdash; <HI>Enter Poet and Painter.</HI>] "The Poet and the Painter were within view when Apemantus parted from Timon, and might then have &s;een Timon, &s;ince Apemantus, &s;tanding by him could &s;ee them: But the &s;cenes of the thieves and &s;teward have pa&s;sed before their arrival, and yet pa&s;sed, as the drama is now con|ducted, within their view. It might be &s;u&s;pected, that &s;ome &s;cenes are transpo&s;ed, for all the&s;e difficulties would be removed by introducing the Poet and Painter fir&s;t, and the thieves in this place. Yet I am afraid the &s;cenes mu&s;t keep their pre&s;ent order; for the Painter alludes to
<PB N="155" REF="164">the thieves when he &s;ays, <HI>he likewi&s;e enriched poor &s;trag|gling &s;oldiers with great quantity.</HI> This impropriety is now heightened by placing the thieves in one act, and the Poet and Painter in another: but it mu&s;t be remem|bered, that in the original edition this play is not divided into &s;eparate acts, &s;o that the pre&s;ent distribution is arbi|trary, and may be changed if any convenience can be gained, or impropriety obviated by alteration. JOHNSON."</P>
<P>Had the learned critic peru&s;ed the &s;mall remainder of the Painters &s;peech, he would have perceived another incongruity, of which he does not &s;eem to be aware. In the immediately preceding &s;cene (the fir&s;t of the fifth act) Flavius, Timons &s;teward, has a conference with his master, and receives gold from him. Between this and the pre&s;ent &s;cene, a &s;ingle minute cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to pa&s;s; and yet the Painter tells his companion:&mdash;<HI>'tis &s;aid, he gave</HI> his &s;teward a <HI>mighty &s;um.</HI> Where was it &s;aid? Why in Athens, whence, it mu&s;t therefor &s;eem, they are but newly come. <HI>Here</HI> then &s;hould be fixed the commencement of the <HI>fifth act,</HI> in order to allow time for Flavius to return to the city, and for rumour to publi&s;h his adventure with Timon. But how are we, in this ca&s;e, to account for Apemantuses announcing the approach of the Poet and Painter in the la&s;t &s;cene of the preceding act, and before the thieves appear? It is po&s;&s;ible that, when this play was abridged for repre&s;entation, all be|tween this pa&s;&s;age and the entrance of the Poet and Painter, may have been omitted by the players, and the&s;e words put into the mouth of Apemantus to introduce them: and that when it was publi&s;hed at large, the interpolation was un|noticed. Or, if we allow the Poet and the Painter to &s;ee Apemantus, it may be conjectured that they did not think his pre&s;ence nece&s;&s;ary at their interview with Timon, and had therefor returned back into the city.</P>

<P>Now with all proper de&s;erence to the misunder&s;tanding and confu&s;ion under which the learned critic labours in the above note, it is evident that the &s;oldier, when he fir&s;t &s;ees the heap of earth does not know it to be a <HI>tomb.</HI> He con|cludes that Timon mu&s;t be dead, becau&s;e he receives <HI>no an|&s;wer.</HI> It is likewi&s;e evident that when he utters the words <HI>&s;ome bea&s;t, &amp;c.</HI> he has <HI>not</HI> &s;een the in&s;cription.

Mr. Steevens &s;u&s;pects that <HI>you mu&s;t not know when he &s;ups,</HI> &s;hould be added to the &s;peech of Pandarus; and that the following one of Paris &s;hould be given to Helen.

<P>The hunts up, mr. Steevens &s;ays, was the name of the tune anciently played to wake the hunters, and collect them together.

Whatever may be the temporary religion, Popi&s;h or Protestant, Pagani&s;m or Christianity, if its profe&s;&s;ors have the &s;lighte&s;t regard for genius or virtue, Shak&s;peare, the poet of nature, addicted to no &s;ystem of bigotry, will always be a favourite. There never was but one &s;et of men who profe&s;sed open enmity to his name and writings, and they were, at the &s;ame time, the declared and mo&s;t virulent enemies of literature and morality, in every &s;hape: It is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to add the mention of the barbarous en|thu&s;ia&s;ts of the la&s;t century; one, and perhaps the be&s;t founded of who&s;e charges again&s;t that great and good mo|narch whom they &s;o &s;avagely murdered was&mdash;his intimacy with the writings of WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE!!!&mdash;The circum&s;tance would, at this time, at lea&s;t, pa&s;s unnoticed in &s;uch a miscreant as <HI>Cocke,</HI> to whom a hatred of letters was as natural as it was to his more illustrious predece&s;&s;or <HI>Jack Cade:</HI>&mdash;but when we &s;ee Milton&mdash;the &s;ublime Milton&mdash;in|&s;i&s;ting upon the enormity of this amiable trait in the cha|racter of his murdered and libeled &s;overeign&mdash;our con|tempt for and detestation of the act is equaled by our &s;ur|prize to find <HI>him</HI> the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in!</P>

"This &s;peech," &s;ays dr. John&s;on, "in which Hamlet, re|pre&s;ented as a virtuous character, is not content with taking blood for blood, but contrives damnation for the man that he would puni&s;h, is too horrible to be read or to be uttered."</P>
<P>How far it detracts from the virtue of Hamlet to be repre&s;ented as lying in wait for an opportunity to take an adequate and complete revenge upon the murderer of his father, is a question not, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the great mo|rali&s;t, quite &s;o ea&s;yly decided. The late king has reported his&s;elf to have been de&s;troyed in the mo&s;t deliberate, horrid, and diabolical manner;
<Q><L>Cut off ev'n in the blo&s;&s;om of his &s;in,</L>
<L>Unhou&s;el'd, disappointed, unaneal'd,</L>
<L>No reckoning made, but &s;ent to his account,</L>
<L>With all his imperfections on his head:</L>
<L>O horrible! O horrible! mo&s;t horrible!</L></Q> Under &s;uch aggravated circum&s;tances, for Hamlet to be content with having what dr. John&s;on calls blood for blood, would have been taking an inadequate and imperfect revenge, and, con&s;equently, doing an act of inju&s;tice and impiety to the <HI>manes</HI> of his murdered parent. But, indeed, the rea&s;ons Hamlet here gives for his conduct, as they are better than any other per&s;on can make for him, will fully justify both him and it, again&s;t all &s;uch hypercritical op|po&s;ition to the end of time.</P>

<L>Now cracks a noble heart: Good night, &s;weet prince;</L>
<L>And flights of angels &s;ing thee to thy re&s;t.</L>
</SP>
<P>Mr. Steevenses note on this pa&s;&s;age is &s;o intere&s;ting and extraordinary that it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;ert it here at large, le&s;t it might be thought to be partially or unfairly repre&s;ented in the remarks which it has occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>"Let us review for a moment the behaviour of Hamlet, on the &s;trength of which Horatio founds this eulogy, and recommends him to the patronage of angels.</P>
<P>"Hamlet, at the command of his father's gho&s;t, under|takes with &s;eeming alacrity to revenge the murder; and declares he will bani&s;h all other thoughts from his mind. He makes, however, but one effort to keep his word, and that is, when he mistakes Polonius for the king. On ano|ther occa&s;ion, he defers his purpo&s;e till he can find an op|portunity of taking his uncle when he is lea&s;t prepared for death, that he may in&s;ure damnation to his &s;oul. Though he a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated Polonius by accident, yet he deliberately procures the execution of his &s;chool-fellows, Ro&s;encrantz and Guilden&s;tern, who appear to have been unacquainted with the treacherous purpo&s;es of the mandate they were employed to carry. Their death (as he declares in a &s;ub&s;e|quent conver&s;ation with Horatio) gives him no concern, for they obtruded them&s;elves into the &s;ervice, and he thought he had a right to de&s;troy them. He is not le&s;s ac|countable for the distraction and death of Ophelia. He
<PB N="216" REF="225">comes to interrupt the funeral de&s;igned in honour of this lady, at which both the king and queen were pre&s;ent; and, by &s;uch an outrage to decency, renders it &s;till more nece&s;|&s;ary for the u&s;urp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r to lay a &s;econd &s;tratagem for his life, though the fir&s;t had proved abortive. He comes to in&s;ult the brother of the dead, and to boa&s;t of an affection for his &s;ister, which, before, he had denied to her face; and yet at this very time mu&s;t be con&s;idered as de&s;irous of &s;up|porting the character of a madman, &s;o that the openne&s;s of his confe&s;&s;ion is not to be imputed to him as a virtue. He apologizes to Horatio afterwards for the ab&s;urdity of this behaviour, to which, he &s;ays, he was provoked by that noblene&s;s of fraternal grief, which, indeed, he ought rather to have applauded than condemned. Dr. John&s;on has ob&s;erved, that to bring about a reconciliation with Laertes, he has availed him&s;elf of a dishone&s;t fallacy; and to conclude, it is obvious to the mo&s;t carele&s;s &s;pectator or reader, that he kills the king at la&s;t to revenge him&s;elf, and not his father.</P>
<P>"Hamlet cannot be &s;aid to have pur&s;ued his ends by very warrantable means; and if the poet, when he &s;acri|ficed him at la&s;t, meant to have enforced &s;uch a moral, it is not the wor&s;t that can be deduced from the play; for as <HI>Maximus,</HI> in Beaumont and Fletchers <HI>Valentinian,</HI> &s;ays,
<Q><L>"Although his justice were as white as truth,</L>
<L>"His way was crooked to it; that condemns him."</L></Q></P>
<P>"The late dr. Akin&s;ide once ob&s;erved to me, that the conduct of Hamlet was every way unnatural and indefen|&s;ible, unle&s;s he were to be regarded as a young man who&s;e intellects were in &s;ome degree impaired by his own misfor|tunes; by the death of his father, the lo&s;s of expected &s;o|vereignty, and a &s;en&s;e of &s;hame re&s;ulting from the ha&s;ty and ince&s;tuons marriage of his mother.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="226">
"I have dwelt the longer on this &s;ubject, becau&s;e Ham|let &s;eems to have been hitherto regared as a hero not un|de&s;erving the pity of the audience; and becau&s;e no writer on Shake&s;peare has taken the pains to point out the immoral tendency of his character."</P>
<P>There are very few, it is believed, at all acquainted with this inimitable author, who would not be &s;urpri&s;ed, nay a&s;toni&s;hed, at &s;uch a &s;evere and unexpected attack upon his principal and mo&s;t favourite character: a character every one has been hitherto led to admire and e&s;teem, not more by univer&s;al and long e&s;tabli&s;hed opinion, than by the &s;enti|ments and feelings of his own mind. To find the amiable, the injured, the distracted, and unfortunate Hamlet repre|&s;ented as a worthle&s;s and immoral being, totally unde&s;erv|ing of the lea&s;t pity from tho&s;e almo&s;t numberle&s;s audiences whom the united force of Nature, Shak&s;peare, and Garrick has compelled to weep for his misfortunes; and who&s;e compa&s;&s;ion would not be le&s;s in the clo&s;et than in the theatre, &s;eems the mo&s;t extraordinary and irreconcilable proceeding in a writer of genius and learning that can be well imagined. However, as the heavy charges which are here brought again&s;t him will, upon the &s;lighte&s;t examination, appear to be groundle&s;s, unwarrantable, and unju&s;t, there is little rea&s;on to fear that the confidence and ingenuity with which they are advanced and &s;upported will an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of the learned objector.</P>
<P>Hamlet, the onely child of the late king, upon who&s;e death he became lawfully intitled to the crown, had, it &s;eems, ever &s;ince that event, been in a &s;tate of melancholy, owing to ex|ce&s;&s;ive grief for the &s;uddenne&s;s with which it had taken place, and an indignant horror at his mothers &s;peedy and incestu|ous marriage. The &s;pirit of the king his father appears, and makes him acquainted with the circum&s;tances of his un|timely
<PB N="218" REF="227">fate, which he excites him to <HI>revenge:</HI> this Ham|let engages to do: an engagement it does not appear he ever forgot. It behoved him, however, to conduct his&s;elf with the greate&s;t prudence. The u&s;urper was powerful, and had Hamlet carryed his de&s;ign into immediate execu|tion, it could not but have been attended with the wor&s;t con&s;equences to his own life and fame. No one knew what the gho&s;t had imparted to him; till he afterwards made Horatio acquainted with it: and though his interview with the &s;pirit gave him certain proof and &s;a|tisfactory rea&s;on to know and dete&s;t the u&s;urper, it would &s;carcely, in the eye of the people, have justifyed his killing their king. To conceal, and, at a convenient time, to ef|fect, his purpo&s;e, he counterfeits madne&s;s, and, for his greater a&s;&s;urance, puts the &s;pirits evidence and the u&s;urpers guilt to the te&s;t of a play, by which the truth of each is manife&s;ted. He &s;oon after e&s;pies the u&s;urper at prayers, but re&s;olves, and with great justice re&s;olves, not to kill him in the very moment when he might be making his peace with heaven: inasmuch as a death &s;o timed would have been rather a happyne&s;s than a puni&s;hment, and, by no means, a proper revenge for his fathers murder. We next find him in the queens apartment, endeavouring to make her &s;en&s;ible of the &s;tate of vice and horror into which her unnatural connection with the u&s;urper had plunged her. At the beginning of this conference he mistakes Polonius, who was <HI>behind the arras,</HI> and about to alarm the hou&s;ehold, for the u&s;urper, and, under that apprehen&s;ion, &s;tabs him. The &s;pirit appears (not very nece&s;&s;aryly, perhaps) "to whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his almo&s;t blunted purpo&s;e." He is, immediately, &s;ent off to England: and, in his pa&s;&s;age, discovers the treacherous and fatal purpo&s;e of the commi&s;&s;ion with which his compa|nion and pretended friends were charged. The&s;e men, he
<PB N="219" REF="228">knew, had eagerly &s;olicited and even thru&s;t their&s;elves upon this employment; and he had, of cour&s;e, &s;ufficient rea&s;on to conclude that they were well acquainted with the nature and purport of their fatal packet. That Shak&s;peare meant to charge them with this knowlege, and to repre&s;ent them as <HI>participes criminis,</HI> is evident from the old black letter <HI>Hystorie</HI> which furni&s;hed him with the &s;ubject, where they are not only made privy to, but actually <HI>devi&s;e</HI> the &s;cheme to take Hamlets life. His own &s;afety depended on their removal; and, at &s;uch a time, and under &s;uch circum|&s;tances, he would have been fully justifyed in u&s;ing any means to procure it.</P>
<P>That he is "accountable for the distraction and death of Ophelia" is a mo&s;t &s;trange charge indeed. He had, to be &s;ure, accidentally killed her father, whom he <HI>took for his betters.</HI> This cau&s;es her distraction; and her distraction cau&s;es her death. A mo&s;t lamentable train of circum&s;tances! and with which the moral character of Hamlet is as little concerned at that of the ingenious, though uncandid, com|mentator.</P>
<P>That "he comes to interrupt the funeral de&s;igned in ho|nour of this lady," is an a&s;&s;ertion which has nothing but the credit of the a&s;&s;erter to &s;upport it. Walking with his friend Horatio through a churchyard, he enters into con|ver&s;ation with a grave-digger; but, pre&s;ently, ob&s;erving the approach of a funeral proce&s;&s;ion, he &s;ays to Horatio, to whom he was then &s;peaking:
<Q><L>Soft, &s;oft, a&s;ide. Here comes the king,</L>
<L>The queen, the courtiers: <HI>Who is this they follow?</HI></L>
<L><HI>And with &s;uch maimed rites?</HI> This doth betoken</L>
<L>The cor&s;e they follow, did with de&s;perate hand</L>
<L><PB N="220" REF="229">Fordo its own life. 'Twas of &s;ome e&s;tate,</L>
<L>Couch we a while, and mark.</L></Q> Does it appear from hence that he knew, or had the lea&s;t rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect this to be the funeral of Ophelia; or even that he was appri&s;ed of her distraction or unfortu|nate death? The contrary is mo&s;t certain. He left the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ingdom before her in&s;anity broke out, and does not re|turn till after &s;he is dead: he has &s;een no one, except Ho|ratio, who was certainly unacquainted with the latter cir|cum&s;tance, &s;o that it is next to an impo&s;&s;ibility that he could have known what had happened to her. But to pro|ceed: Laertes a&s;king <HI>what ceremony el&s;e?</HI> Hamlet ob&s;erves to Horatio, <HI>That is Laertes; a very noble youth.</HI> Laertes concluding his expostulation about the further honours with the following beautyful lines:
<Q><L>&mdash; lay her i'the earth;</L>
<L>And from her fair and unpolluted fle&s;h</L>
<L>May violets &s;pring!&mdash;I tell thee, churli&s;h prie&s;t,</L>
<L>A mini&s;tring angel &s;hall <HI>my &s;ister</HI> be,</L>
<L>When thou lie&s;t howling;</L></Q> Hamlet exclaims: <HI>What! the fair Ophelia?</HI> His &s;urpri&s;e and a&s;toni&s;hment on hearing Laertes name his &s;ister are manife&s;tly apparent, and may &s;erve to convince the learned critic, and every one who has been misled by his ill-founded accu&s;ations, that Hamlet does NOT come to interrupt the funeral, and is guilty of NO outrage what|ever. He as little "comes to in&s;ult the brother of the dead," or "to boa&s;t of an affection for his &s;ister, which before he had [in a wild and carele&s;s manner when he was under the nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>counterfeiting madne&s;s</HI>] denied to her face." Laertes bids
<Q><L>&mdash; Treble woe</L>
<L>Fall ten times treble on that cur&s;ed head,</L>
<L><PB N="221" REF="230">Who&s;e wicked deed thy mo&s;t ingenious &s;en&s;e</L>
<L>Depriv'd thee of;</L></Q> an execration Hamlet cannot but perceive to be pointed at his&s;elf. Having uttered this cur&s;e, Laertes, ha&s;tyly, and in direct violation of all decorum, jumps into the grave, where he "rants and mouths it" like a player. This out|rageous proceeding &s;eems to infect Hamlet; who, forgetting his&s;elf, as he afterward, with &s;orrow, owns to Horatio, and, by the "bravery" of the others grief being worked up "into a towering pa&s;&s;ion," leaps in after him: and he who thinks Hamlets madne&s;s or &s;incerity counterfeit here does not appear to know &s;o much of Shak&s;peare or of human nature as every one who reads this play ought to do.</P>
<P>The affection Hamlet now boa&s;ts for Ophelia was ge|nuine and violent; we find him with the very &s;ame &s;enti|ments in the beginning of the play, and he has never once disowned it, except on a &s;ingle occa&s;ion, when the &s;acrifice was required by his a&s;&s;umed character; a circum&s;tance which cannot, at lea&s;t ought not to, be imputed to him as a crime.</P>
<P>The behaviour and language of Laertes is more ranting and unnatural, than noble and pathetic, and, with his ex|ecration upon Hamlet previously to his leaping into the grave, and the violent &s;hock which Hamlet might feel on learning the cor&s;e to be Ophelias, might ea&s;yly work up to, and apologi&s;e for, a higher pitch of extravagance, a &s;tronger and more compo&s;ed mind than that of which Hamlet appears to have been then master.</P>
<P>Hamlets conver&s;ation with Laertes, immediately before the fencing &s;cene, was at the queens earne&s;t intreaty, and though dr. John&s;on be plea&s;ed to give it the har&s;h name of "a dishone&s;t fallacy," there are better, becau&s;e more na|tural, judges who con&s;ider it as a mo&s;t gentle and pathetic
<PB N="222" REF="231">addre&s;s; and cannot perceive it to be either dishone&s;t or fallacious: for, certainly, Hamlet did not intend the death of <HI>Polonius;</HI> of con&s;equence, unwittingly, and by mere ac|cident, injured Laertes, who, after declaring that he was "&s;atisfyed in nature," and that he onely delayed his per|fect reconcilement till his honour were &s;atisfyed by elder masters, whom, at the &s;ame time, (for he has the in&s;tru|ment of death in his hand) he never meant to con&s;ult, &s;ays,
<Q><L>&mdash; Till that time,</L>
<L>I do receive your offer'd LOVE LIKE LOVE,</L>
<L>And WILL NOT WRONG IT.</L></Q></P>
<P>On which the truely virtuous, innocent, and un&s;u&s;pecting Hamlet replies,
<Q><L>&mdash; I embrace it freely</L>
<L>And will this BROTHERS wager frankly play.</L></Q></P>
<P>Let the conduct and &s;entiments of Laertes, in this inter|view, and in his conver&s;ation with the u&s;urper, together with his villainous de&s;ign again&s;t the life of Hamlet, be examined and tryed by any rules of gentility, honour, or humanity, natural or artificial, he mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a treacherous, cowardly, diabolical wretch. Is &s;uch a cha|racter to ri&s;e on the fall of the generous Hamlet?</P>
<P>Things are &s;ometimes obvious to very carele&s;s &s;pecta|tors or readers, which are not discerned by tho&s;e who play clo&s;er attention to the &s;cene. Hamlet, in a trial of &s;kill with Laertes, receives an unexpected, a treacherous, and mortal wound. Immediately before the company enter, he appears to be much troubled in mind; his &s;pirits fore|boding what was to happen: "If it be now," &s;ays he, "'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come; the readyne&s;s is all."
<PB N="223" REF="232">He does not appear to have &s;u&s;pected Laertes of any unfair practice (he did not know &s;o much of him as we do), but he had every rea&s;on to expect treachery and murder from the u&s;urper; he might too have heared &s;omething of his &s;ecret juggling with Laertes; and, doubtle&s;s, intended to revenge the death of his father. Being thus wounded, and on the thre&s;hold of futurity, if he had not killed the u&s;urper im|mediately, the villain would have e&s;caped unpuni&s;hed. But he does not &s;tab him for his treachery toward his&s;elf,&mdash;he upbraids him with his crimes of INCEST and MURDER,&mdash; and con&s;igns him to the infernal regions,
<Q>With all his 'rank offences' thick upon him.</Q></P>
<P>So that he &s;ufficiently revenges his father, his mother (who, by the way, dyes, if not de&s;ervedly, at lea&s;t unpityed), and his&s;elf. As to his own fall, every reader or &s;pectator mu&s;t &s;ympathi&s;e with Horatio, for the untimely lo&s;s of a youth|ful prince po&s;&s;e&s;sed of &s;uch great and amiable qualities, rendered mi&s;erable by &s;uch unparalleled misfortunes;
<Q><L>&mdash;For he was likely, had he been put on,</L>
<L>To have prov'd mo&s;t royally;</L></Q> and who falls a &s;acrifice to the mo&s;t ba&s;e and infernal ma|chinations. His death, however, is not to be looked upon as a puni&s;hment; the mo&s;t innocent, as Shak&s;peare well knew, are frequently confounded with the mo&s;t guilty; and the virtues of Hamlet were to be rewarded among tho&s;e angels which his friend Horatio invokes to e&s;cort him to everla&s;ting re&s;t.</P>
<P>Dr. Aken&s;ide was a very ingenious, &s;en&s;ible, and worthy man: but enough has been &s;aid to &s;atisfy tho&s;e who doubt, that the conduct of Hamlet is neither unnatural nor inde|fen&s;ible. That his intellects were really impaired by the circum&s;tances enumerated by the above learned phy&s;ician,
<PB N="224" REF="233">is very probable; and, indeed, Hamlet his&s;elf, more than once, plainly in&s;inuates it. See, in particular, the latter part of his &s;oliloquy at the end of the &s;econd act.</P>
<P>The oppo&s;ing and refuting of general charges by proof and circum&s;tance commonly requires much more time and &s;pace than the making of them. The writer is &s;en&s;ible that the arguments here adduced are neither arranged &s;o judiciously, nor expre&s;sed &s;o well, as the objections of the learned com|mentator; but from what has been &s;aid, and as it is &s;aid, it will appear, that it has not been without &s;trong and &s;uf|ficient rea&s;ons that Hamlet has "been hitherto regarded as a hero not unde&s;erving the pity of the audience;" and the ingenious critic will not, perhaps, have much cau&s;e to con|gratulate his&s;elf, on being the onely per&s;on who has taken pains to point out the <HI>immoral tendency</HI> of as noble, as virtuous, and as intere&s;ting a character,

<P>THIS edition will be compri&s;ed in eight duodecimo volumes; and will be carefully and accurately printed from the onely copies of real authority, the two fir&s;t folios. But although the&s;e editions will be the &s;tandard of the intended work, &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages in the old quartos as may appear to have been omitted by accident, or with a view to &s;horten the repre&s;entation, and every various reading, will be maturely con&s;idered, and, if wor|thy of in&s;ertion, be adopted, either in the text or margin, as their importance or merit may &s;eem to require. No variation, however, will be made from the &s;tandard edi|tions
<PB REF="249">without appri&s;ing the reader of it, unle&s;s the diffe|rence &s;hould con&s;i&s;t merely in a &s;light typographical error. Nor is any difference between the various editions in other re&s;pects intended to be otherwi&s;e than occa&s;ionally re|garded. The orthography will be reduced with the utmo&s;t care to a modern and uniform &s;ystem, except where a change would be injurious to the authors &s;en&s;e and meaning. Various or doubtful readings will be &s;ettled from an attentive examination of the &s;entiments of every commentator. The notes, which will be very &s;paringly introduced, and never but where they &s;eem ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary, or peculiarly proper, will be chiefly extracted, under the names of their re&s;pective authors, from the edi|tions of Theobald, Warburton, John&s;on, and Steevens; but not to the exclu&s;ion of better, though, perhaps, ano|nymous, intelligence, if it can be given. It is, however, no part of the editors de&s;ign to fill his margin with a view of the corruptions, or a refutation of the errors of preced|ing commentators.</P>
<P>The authors life, with the u&s;ual documents (particularly a more exact copy of his will than has been yet publi&s;hed), and the prefaces of his various editors will be prefixed to to the work: which will, likewi&s;e, be attended with a new, copious, and accurate glo&s;&s;ary. And, in an additional vo|lume, it is propo&s;ed to give a complete verbal index, adapted to the intended edition.</P>
<P>This edition will, with regard to the correctne&s;s of the text, be infinitely &s;uperior to any that has yet appeared. It will po&s;&s;e&s;s all the advantages of every former edition, and be as little liable, it is hoped, as po&s;&s;ible to the defects of any.</P>
