<HEAD>GEORGE.</HEAD>
<P>LITTLE George was fond of walking in a wood that bordered on his father's ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en: Now this wood was formed of little trees, placed very near each other, and two paths conducting through it, cro&s;&s;ed. One day, as he was &s;auntering up and down, he wi&s;hed to re&s;t him&s;elf a little, with his back &s;upported by a tree, who&s;e &s;tem was yet quite &s;lender, and which therefore &s;hook through all its branches, when his body fir&s;t touched it. As it chanced, the ru&s;tling frighted a poor little bird, which flew out of a neighbouring bu&s;h, and &s;oon di&s;ap|peared.</P>
<P>George &s;aw it fly away, and was vexed. He fixed his eye upon the bu&s;h, to &s;ee if it would not return: and while he was attentively con&s;idering it, he thought he &s;aw a|mong the branches, at a &s;pot where they were twi&s;ted into one another, &s;omething like a tuft of hay. His curio&s;ity induced him to draw nearer and examine it. He found this tuft of hay was hollow like a porringer: he thru&s;t a&s;ide the branches, and &s;aw certain little balls within it, of an oval &s;hape, and &s;potted. They were placed be&s;ide each other, on a layer of gra&s;s. Sure this, &s;aid George, mu&s;t be what I have heard &s;ome people call a bird's ne&s;t; and the balls are eggs. They are indeed quite little, but the bird is not &s;o big as any of our hens.</P>
<P>It was his fir&s;t de&s;ign to carry away the ne&s;t; however, upon &s;econd thoughts, he was contented with one egg; and having taken it, ran home. He met his &s;i&s;ter by the way, and thus addre&s;&s;ed her: "See this little egg. I found it in a ne&s;t: there were five others with it." "Let me have it in my hand;" &s;aid George's &s;i&s;ter. She exa|mines it, returns it to her brother, and then a&s;ks a &s;econd time to have it. In the end, they roll it up and down a
<PB N="2" REF="6">table, ju&s;t as if it were a ball. One &s;hoves it one way, and the other pu&s;hes it another way, till, in the mid&s;t of their diver&s;ion, it falls down and breaks. They cry, and mutually accu&s;e each other as the cau&s;e of &s;uch a great misfortune.</P>
<P>As it chanced, their mother hears them thus complain|ing; and not knowing why they weep, approaches to con|&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e them. Both begin at once. She hears their different &s;tories, and then taking each affectionately by the hand, conducts them to a tree that over&s;hadowed a green bank, on which &s;he bids them both &s;it down.</P>
<P>Be comforted, dear children, &s;aid &s;he. That you have broke the egg between you both, is truly a misfortune; but it is one, however, that &s;hould not much grieve you, &s;ince you did not mean to do &s;o. I might notwith&s;tanding blame you, George, with ju&s;tice, for the act of having brought it from the ne&s;t. You mu&s;t have &s;een hen's eggs di&s;po&s;ed of in a &s;ort of ne&s;t. The mother &s;its on, warms and animates them. Chickens in about three weeks are formed within them, and they pierce the &s;hell. In &s;ome &s;ew days, they come and feed out of your hand. This egg would al&s;o have become a &s;ort of chick, which you have killed by bringing it away. The bird that flew out of the bu&s;h as you inform me, was the mother. Doubtle&s;s &s;he will come again, and very &s;hortly, to her ne&s;t: &s;he will perceive that one egg is wanting, and perhaps for&s;ake it altogether. This is frequently the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Perhaps this lo&s;s of but a &s;ingle egg, informs them that their a&s;ylum is di&s;covered; they have every thing to fear from our violence; they gue&s;s that when their little ones are hatched, he who has already robbed them, will return and &s;eize upon their tender family. If then this ne&s;t which you have been thus robbing, as I mu&s;t call it, &s;hould be totally abandoned,&mdash;tell me, would you not be &s;orry for it?</P>
<P>Yes, mama, indeed, replied little George; and I am &s;orry that I meddled with the egg; but then I did not know a &s;yllable of what you have been telling us; and thought no harm in bringing it to &s;hew my &s;i&s;ter, which is all that I meant to do.</P>
<P>My little fellow, I can ea&s;ily believe you, &s;aid the mo|ther. Should you do bad actions for the plea&s;ure which &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e there is in doing them, you would in that
<PB N="3" REF="7">ca&s;e have a very wicked heart, and I &s;hould be quite &s;orry that I had &s;uch a &s;on: but that I do not fear; for, on the contrary, I know you to be a very good boy.</P>
<P>Mama, &s;aid the little girl, the ne&s;t, for I have &s;een it, out of which my brother took this egg, does not re&s;emble in the lea&s;t tho&s;e &s;wallows ne&s;ts that we &s;ee about our out-hou&s;e roof. My dear child, &s;aid the mother, every ne&s;t is not alike; nor yet is every bird alike; for &s;ome are great, and others little. Some are never known to perch on trees, and others live at all times in them. Some are large and &s;tupid, others &s;mall and full of indu&s;try and cunning. Some are beautiful beyond de&s;cription in their plumage, which has half a dozen colours; others are of one dull colour. Some &s;ub&s;i&s;t on fruits, &s;ome go in que&s;t of in&s;ects, and a multitude of others &s;eize on &s;maller birds, and eat them.</P>
<P>Ah the wicked creatures! cried the little girl. I do not love the&s;e la&s;t, and &s;hould be glad to &s;poil their ne&s;ts. So too would many others, &s;aid her mama; and there|fore tho&s;e great birds that con&s;tantly devour the le&s;s, con&s;truct their ne&s;ts in places where they cannot ea&s;ily be come at; as for in&s;tance in woods, and in the holes of rocks, where men appear but very &s;eldom; and at heights beyond our reach, however &s;kilful we may be in climbing.</P>
<P>Therefore, deare&s;t children, &s;ince the&s;e birds are great|ly different from each other, not only in &s;ize, but al&s;o in their way of life, and in the colour of their feathers, it is but rea&s;onable that they &s;hould have ne&s;ts different al&s;o from each other. Thus the lark which never lives in any tree, but &s;ings, as you have heard her, mounting in the air; con&s;tructs her ne&s;t upon the ground; the &s;wallow builds about the roofs of hou&s;es, under what we call the eaves; the owl, which people only hear by night, &s;eeks out old ruinous buildings, or &s;ome hollow tree to put her eggs in; and the eagle which I &s;hewed you ye&s;terday flying above the clouds and nearly out of &s;ight, brings forth her young ones in the cliffs of craggy rocks. Tho&s;e living round about us, make their ne&s;ts in trees and hedges. Tho&s;e that love the water, and who find their food therein, build theirs among tho&s;e ru&s;hes that grow
<PB N="4" REF="8">near it, upon little i&s;lands, and at times upon the &s;hore it&s;elf.</P>
<P>If one of the&s;e fine days we go into the little valley at the bottom of our large meadow, we &s;hall &s;ee a num|ber of the&s;e little creatures bu&s;y in &s;electing the materials they compo&s;e their ne&s;ts of. One you will ob&s;erve em|ployed in carrying off a wheaten &s;traw; another will have in his beak &s;ome wool or feathers; or dried leaves; and very probably a third &s;ome mo&s;s. The &s;wallow, by the border of a &s;tream, you will take notice, moi&s;tens with the water which he takes up in his beak, a little bit of earth with which he builds his habitation. Such materi|als as are very coar&s;e and &s;olid, he will take to form the out&s;ide of his ne&s;t, but lines it with the &s;ofte&s;t and the warme&s;t. Nay, there are &s;ome birds who pull out their own feathers to make up a more comfortable bed for their little ones.</P>
<P>They con&s;truct large ne&s;ts, or &s;mall ones, in proportion to the number of young birds that they are to hatch with|in them. Some will hang their ne&s;ts up by a &s;ort of thread, which thread they have the &s;kill to form of flax, of different &s;orts of weeds, and of the webs of &s;piders. Others place it in the middle of a &s;oft and gluey &s;ub&s;tance, whereunto they carefully &s;tick many feathers. All do every thing in their power to make it &s;trong and &s;olid, and &s;ecure them&s;elves from every enemy that In&s;tinct bids them fear, by re&s;orting to retired and &s;olitary places.</P>
<P>There they lay their eggs. The mother, and at times the father, &s;its upon them in the ne&s;t, with admirable per&s;everance. They are taught by nature, that the warmth proceeding from their body, when they &s;it upon the&s;e eggs, puts every thing within them into motion, and produces little creatures, which at la&s;t are &s;trong enough to break the &s;hell that holds them, and come forth.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t have often &s;een a fly in winter, to appearance dead. You took it in your hands, and through the warm h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> proceeding from them, it was brought to life. It is nearly thus with birds: the per&s;everance of the pa|rents, when they brood upon their eggs, converts them into living creatures.</P>
<P>When the mother &s;its alone, the cock will bring her victuals, and &s;it by to plea&s;e her with his mu&s;ic. When the little ones are once alive, they help them to get clear
<PB N="5" REF="9">of their confinement in the egg. Their diligence is now redoubled; they do every thing to nouri&s;h and defend them, and are con&s;tantly employed in this intere&s;ting office. They go very far indeed to get their food, and make an equal di&s;tribution of it, every one receiving in its turn what they have brought. As long as they are very young and helple&s;s, they contrive to bring them vic|tuals &s;uited to their delicacy; but when once they are grown &s;trong and older, they provide them food more &s;olid.</P>
<P>There is one, and that a very large one, called a <HI>peli|can,</HI> who being forced to go great di&s;tances in que&s;t of victuals for her young ones, is provided with a &s;ort of bag. She fills it with &s;uch aliments as &s;he is &s;en&s;ible they love: &s;he warms what &s;he procures, and renders it by &s;uch means fitter for their tender &s;tomachs: &s;he returns, and empties it before them.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of being parents, they appear as if forgetting that they want food them&s;elves, and only think upon their little family. If either rain or tempe&s;ts come, they hurry to their ne&s;ts, and cover it as well as they are able with their out&s;tretched wings, &s;o keeping out the wind and water that might hurt the brood. All night too, they are bu&s;y in the work of cheri&s;hing the little things. The fearfulle&s;t among them, that will fly away if they but hear the &s;lighte&s;t noi&s;e, and tremble at the lea&s;t degree of danger, know not what fear is when they have once a family to protect, but become courageous and intrepid: as for in&s;tance, the common hen. As great a coward as &s;he is when by her&s;elf, &s;he grows a very heroine, a pat|tern of courage, when &s;he has young ones to defend from danger. She attacks the greate&s;t dog, and will not even fear a man, who &s;hould attempt to take them from her.</P>
<P>So too do the little birds endeavour to defend their young, when any one would &s;teal or hurt them. They will flutter round the ne&s;t, will &s;eem to call out for a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, will attack the invader, and pur&s;ue him. If their young be &s;hut within a cage, they will continue to come regularly, and at all times feed them. Frequently the mother will prefer confinement with them, rather than be freed from the nece&s;&s;ity of tending on them, and will never quit the little creatures.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="10">Poor dear birds! cried out the children, how we &s;hall love you for the future! We will never be &s;o cruel as to do you any harm. We will only look at your ne&s;ts; and be content|ed to gaze on you, while employed in the delightful ta&s;k of tending on your young, and to contemplate your little family, all flying round their parents.&mdash;Yes, dear chil|dren, &s;aid the mother, thus it &s;hould be. Keep your re|&s;olution as you ought, and I &s;hall love you for it. Never injure any creature, or occa&s;ion it the lea&s;t degree of pain for plea&s;ure's &s;ake: on &s;aying which, the mother went in doors, embracing her dear children, who were highly plea&s;ed with what they had ju&s;t learnt.</P>

<HEAD>JAMES.</HEAD>
<P>A Merchant whom we &s;hall here call James, had but a &s;ingle &s;on, whom he loved very tenderly. He was far from having a bad heart, his countenance was rather pretty, and his friends would all have been very fond of him, but that he &s;hewed in every action, a covetous pro|pen&s;ity which &s;hocked as many as had opportunities of knowing him. This covetou&s;ne&s;s made him violently wi&s;h for every thing po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by others. It even wrought upon him to &s;o great a pitch, that he would con&s;tantly refu&s;e to &s;hare among his play-mates, or even &s;hew them what he had him&s;elf. His father, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a very amiable character, wi&s;hed greatly to reform him of this fault, but never had been able. All that he could do, was to &s;hew how much it grieved him.</P>
<P>Little James, however, lo&s;t a great deal more by his propen&s;ity to avarice, than he had ever gained thereby. Did any body give him &s;weetmeats? He would get away and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">allow them like a churl, in &s;ome dark corner of the hou&s;e, for fear le&s;t any one &s;hould a&s;k a part. Whil&s;t he was hid, his father would give twice as much to his companions: he perceived it, and no longer hid him&s;elf: but as &s;oon as he fixed his eye on &s;weetmeats, or nice things, he appeared as if he would devour them:
<PB N="7" REF="11">he pur&s;ued the hands of tho&s;e who held them, and his own were in a &s;ort of convul&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mr. James, as we have &s;aid before, was very much afflicted in perceiving this; and that he might not be afflicted further than was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, he cea&s;ed to give him any more nice things, or even have them in the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Had little James a wind-mill, boat, or other play-thing, he would never &s;hew it: he concealed him&s;elf in the en|joyment of it, and was never happy. Or, &s;uppo&s;ing he had any &s;ort of fruit, he would not &s;hare it with his play|mates, but devour it all alone, refu&s;ing even tho&s;e whom he happened to love mo&s;t, and &s;uch as might be hungry; therefore none among his play mates would in turn &s;hare any thing with him: they were indeed be&s;t plea&s;ed to leave his company; they never wi&s;hed to have it. When he chanced to be in a quarrel, no one took his part, not even when they knew him in the right; but being in the wrong, all joined again&s;t him.</P>
<P>As it chanced, one day a little boy ob&s;erved him with an apple in his hand, and gave him by &s;urprize a knock upon the elbow, &s;o that he was forced to let the apple go. He picked it up, however; but that moment, to avenge him&s;elf upon the boy that had contrived to play him &s;uch a trick, he &s;et off to catch him, but in running fell into a &s;lough, and was almo&s;t &s;uffocated in the mud. He did his utmo&s;t to get out, but could not: he attempted, but without &s;ucceeding, to prevail upon his playmates to hold out their hands and help him; he ob&s;erved that they only laughed at his di&s;tre&s;s, and, in deri&s;ion, danced about the &s;lough, from which he could not extricate him&s;elf. Their cry was, "Let <HI>him</HI> now hold out a hand to whom you have been generous! A&s;k a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e whom you have obliged!" However at length, one, more compa&s;&s;ionate, came forward, and approach|ing where he &s;tood, &s;tretched forth his hand, and got him out in &s;afety.&mdash;He &s;hook off the mud that covered him, and then, to &s;hew his gratitude to that good little boy who had delivered him, bit off about a quarter from the apple which had cau&s;ed this &s;ad di&s;a&s;ter, and which &s;till he held fa&s;t in his hand, and would fain have made him take it.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="12">The good little boy, di&s;gu&s;ted with the gift, and way of giving, took the mor&s;el, but to fling it in his face; and this was, as it were, a &s;ignal for the re&s;t to &s;cout him. They pur&s;ued our little James quite home, and hallooed all the way.</P>
<P>He was not void of feeling, and had never yet been hooted: he was therefore thrown into a thinking humour, and did not afterwards come much into his father's pre|fence, but confined him&s;elf to his apartment for above ten days together. There he a&s;ked him&s;elf, what cau&s;e his play-mates had to hate him. He addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf as fol|lows: "For what rea&s;on has my little neighbour, he that even held me out his hand when I was in the mire, &s;uch a number of good friends? Why is he loved &s;o much, while I have not a &s;ingle little boy that will &s;eek my company, nor be my friend, nor con&s;ole me in affliction?"&mdash;He di&s;|covered very &s;oon the rea&s;on, by comparing the good boy's behaviour with his own. He recollected that he was happy to do any one a plea&s;ure; that whenever he had any fruit, confectionary, or the like, he felt more joy in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ring it with his companion, than in eating it him&s;elf, and had no &s;ort of amu&s;ement which he did not wi&s;h all his little acquaintances to &s;hare. He &s;aw plainly, on this view of things, how much he differed from this little boy in di&s;po&s;ition. He re&s;olved at la&s;t to imitate him, and went out next day with both his pockets full of fruit, ran up to every boy that he met, and gave him &s;ome: he could not all at once, however, give up <HI>&s;elf,</HI> but left a little in his pocket, which he eat in pri|vate when got home.</P>
<P>Although his liberality was not perfect, he found occa|&s;ion to be &s;atisfied with the effect of it, &s;ince his compa|nions now, on their part, were more generous to him; they &s;hewed them&s;elves more merry in his company; they took him as a partner in their little pa&s;times, they di|vided with him what they had, and he went home quite plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Upon the morrow he did &s;till a great deal better. When he met his little friends, he did not fail to pull out of his pocket every thing that he had, divided it into as many &s;hares as there were mouths to eat it, and re&s;erved a &s;hare no more than equal for him&s;elf. Indeed, if there was any
<PB N="9" REF="13">difference, &s;ome thought that he took the lea&s;t, and he was much more &s;atisfied that day than the preceding.</P>
<P>By degrees he was habituated to be generous, and even to &s;uch as he could &s;ee had nothing in return to give: I mean to &s;uch as were in want. Of cour&s;e he grew be|loved: whenever his companions &s;aw him, they ran up to meet him with the greate&s;t joy upon their countenances; they were glad to give him plea&s;ure. In &s;hort, he was now quite happy.</P>
<P>Such a change could not e&s;cape his father's ob&s;ervation, and it gave him real &s;atisfaction. He affectionately took him in his arms, refu&s;ed him nothing for the time to come, and even &s;ought occa&s;ions to delight him. Every day little James di&s;cerned, that to be happy, it was ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould not de&s;ire a &s;olitary hap|pine&s;s, but wi&s;h to make tho&s;e round about him happy likewi&s;e.</P>

<STAGE>(entering a moment afterwards.)</STAGE>
<P>Where, in the name of goodne&s;s, can papa have poked our poor dead parrot? I ob&s;erved it in his hand, when fir&s;t he came in here; but &s;aw him afterwards go out without it. <STAGE>(He looks round about the apartment; and, at la&s;t, &s;pies the parrot hanging to the cicling.)</STAGE> Ah! ha! there he is! <STAGE>(He takes a run, and jumps with all his might, but wants about three feet, or more, to reach the parrot.)</STAGE> If I were but as active as our greyhound. <STAGE><HI>(He pulls a chair into the middle of the room, and getting on it, is as yet too &s;hort; he &s;tands on tip|tor, and then jumps, but all without effect. He in&s;tantly comes
<PB N="10" REF="14">down, and runs to fetch a folio volume, lettered</HI> Plutarch <HI>on the back; he puts this volume on the chair, mounts on it, and holds out his hands.)</HI></STAGE> Shall I never reach the mark? I want, however, &s;adly to find out how they have &s;tuffed it. Let me take another jump. <STAGE>(He bends his knees to &s;pring, when Marcus entering perceives him, and hums the following words.)</STAGE></P>
<P>Well leaped, in good truth! But do not let me di&s;turb you; for however active you may be, you will need a thou&s;and attempts before you reach it. Such a bit of manhood jump &s;o high! Come down. Let me go up. I think, I &s;hall not want your Plutarch. <STAGE>(He pulls him by the coat till he comes down, then mounts in his &s;tead, and lifting both his hands, is &s;till a great way from the parrot.)</STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER>Frederic, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(bur&s;ting out into a laugh.)</STAGE>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! ha! good Mr. Manhood! By the manner of your &s;peaking, any one would certainly have fancied you as tall as the Monument.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marcus.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if I &s;tep upon the book? <STAGE>(He &s;tands upon it, is a little nearer, but not near enough to touch the parrot. Frederic jumps about the chair, and laughs ince&s;&s;antly.)</STAGE> It is not my fault; but the thing is, this great Plutarch does not happen to be thick enough. Only think! If there had only been a few more clever fellows in antiquity, the parrot would have certainly been mine.</P>

<P>No indeed, not more than Reynard, in the fable, cared about the grapes: the parrot is po&s;&s;ibly too green!&mdash;hey, brother?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marcus.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is the u&s;e of taking it down? I can &s;ee it very well at this di&s;tance.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(coming in.)</STAGE>
<P>Becau&s;e you cannot reach Poll? You mean &s;o? Don't you, Frederick?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frederic.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have been watching us then, papa?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; but do not you &s;ee? Your feet have left it written on my <HI>Plutarch.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marcus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had we been as tall as you, we &s;hould then have been able to &s;ee Poll a great deal nearer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and plagued him after he was dead, as much as you did while he lived. And yet you are tall enough for any &s;ort of mi&s;chief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marcus.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, papa: what plea&s;ure we &s;hould have, if we were both as tall as you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know you well enough: you would not, even in that ca&s;e, be content.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marcus.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, I had much rather be as tall as&mdash; what d'ye call him there, the giant, who came down to &s;hew him&s;elf for money, at the fair?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frederic.</SPEAKER>
<P>That would be but a trifle. No; as we are wi&s;hing, and as wi&s;hes co&s;t &s;o little, we need hardly &s;top thore.&mdash;You recollect our talle&s;t cherry-tree?&mdash;Well then, I could wi&s;h to be as tall as that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frederic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e I &s;hould not want either a ladder or a pole when the fruit was ripe. Do but think a little, brother: how delightful it would be, to walk about the orchard, with our heads among the branches of the trees, to browze on cherries, pears, and apples, and to gather them as we do currants, from the bu&s;h; would not this be charming entertainment?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marcus.</SPEAKER>
<P>One might likewi&s;e walk along the &s;treets, and look into the rooms on either &s;ide the way, three &s;tories high: Ha! ha! I fancy, we &s;hould put the people into a fright!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frederic.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould not fear the carriages, when I had occa&s;ion to cro&s;s the &s;treet. It would be only &s;haddling,
<PB N="12" REF="16">&mdash;Lock ye,&mdash;thus: <STAGE>(he &s;trides,)</STAGE> and I &s;hould &s;ee carts, waggons, coaches, men, and hor&s;es, all pa&s;s under me, and &s;hould &s;mile in deri&s;ion of their littlene&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marcus.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know the river that goes by our hou&s;e in town? We needs mu&s;t take a boat to cro&s;s it, or go round by We&s;tmin&s;ter or Blackfriar's bridges. Well, I might walk through it then, which would be very cooling in the &s;ummer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frederic.</SPEAKER>
<P>And be&s;ides all this, you know, we &s;hould be &s;tronger, were we bigger. If a bull &s;hould venture to attack me, as I cro&s;&s;ed the field, I would twi&s;t his neck off, ju&s;t as if he were a rabbit; or el&s;e chuck him up in the air, a hundred yards high, and when he was come to the ground he &s;hould be &s;o bu&s;y thinking what a tumble he had, that he &s;hould forget entirely to get up again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marcus.</SPEAKER>
<P>We &s;hould not then want hor&s;es for the plough, as we might draw it ea&s;ily our&s;elves: and in ten &s;teps, get quite acro&s;s a very large field. I &s;aw, la&s;t Thur&s;day, more than fifty men at work, in driving piles to make a cau&s;eway. And how hard they worked! Well then, with &s;uch a hammer as my &s;ize would let me rai&s;e, one man night, in a &s;ingle day, di&s;patch their work, and not be tired at night &s;o much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fine talking truly, this; but do you know that after all the&s;e fine wi&s;hes, you are no more than two blockheads?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marcus.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, papa, two blockheads?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; to think that you would be happier than at pre&s;ent, were you bigger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marcus.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, papa, if we were able to do a great deal more than we do at pre&s;ent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frederic.</SPEAKER>
<P>For example: would not it be quite conve|nient, could we reach things very high, and take a deal of ground in travelling at a &s;tep?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Before I an&s;wer you, inform me if, be|coming thus &s;o very tall, you would have every thing be|&s;ides remain as little as it was before your alteration?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frederic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, papa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marcus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes: there &s;hould be none but we three giants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank you; but for my part, I am con|tented with my &s;ize, and would not wi&s;h to change it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="13" REF="17">
<SPEAKER>Frederic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet I think, we ought not to be near &s;o big as you: for otherwi&s;e, it would be the children's part to whip their father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a happy circum&s;tance for me, that I &s;hall not, in a hurry, be expo&s;ed to &s;o much &s;hame and danger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frederic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! but I would &s;pare you, recollecting how often you had &s;hewn me favour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marcus, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(to his father.)</STAGE>
<P>You do not wi&s;h then to be bigger?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, indeed: but let us &s;peak in this place for your brother and you only; and ob&s;erve what would re&s;ult from your being bigger. In the fir&s;t place then, Frederic, if, as you wi&s;hed ju&s;t now, you were as tall as that &s;ame cherry-tree, how would you be able, as at pre&s;ent, to go out and take your walk among &s;o many trees, as fill our orchard? You would be obliged to crawl upon all fours, and even &s;o, you would find it very diffi|cult to get along.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frederic.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you forget, papa, how ea&s;ily I might put out my foot again&s;t the fir&s;t tree &s;tanding in my way, and root it up. It would be nothing but a wheat-&s;talk to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thereby you would pur&s;ue a very prudent plan! &s;o, in proportion as you wanted much more fruit to &s;atisfy your palate, you would de&s;troy the trees that bear it; but let us go a little farther than an orchard. There are many roads about us, upon one &s;ide &s;haded by a row of trees, who&s;e branches overhang the path-way. Men that are of common heights can walk beneath tho&s;e branches at their ea&s;e, and find the &s;hade which they give quite comfortable in the &s;corching heat of &s;ummer, and particularly at noon-day; but you would be obliged to walk along the middle of the road, and have no &s;hade. And then, what would become of you, when you were to make your way through any fore&s;t? What a furious over|throw of trees you would make before you could clear your&s;elf a path!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frederic.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould be no more fatigued than were I now to make a hole &s;ufficient for my pa&s;&s;age through a hedge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marcus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would uproot the talle&s;t oaks, like that &s;ame made Grecian that is mentioned in my Engli&s;h Sophocles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="14" REF="18">
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould &s;incerely pity tho&s;e condemned to live about you; but with &s;uch long legs as you would have, you would take it in your head, no doubt, to travel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frederic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Travel! Why, papa, I would go from one end of the world to the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Like enough! And without halting, I &s;uppo&s;e! For where, tell me, would you find a hou&s;e, a chamber, or a bed, half big enough for your enormous &s;tature? You would certainly be forced to lie all night abroad upon a hay-&s;tack. That would be quite charming! Do not you think &s;o?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frederic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! I &s;hould find my&s;elf as badly off as poor Gulliver in Lilliput.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marcus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! you have not made your &s;y&s;tem quite perfect, brother, I can &s;ee.&mdash;No, that is plain; and you mu&s;t have the re&s;t of men as big as you your&s;elf are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that is more generous, I mu&s;t own. But how then would the ground &s;uffice to feed &s;o many mon&s;trous giants? In a pari&s;h that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts at pre&s;ent, for in&s;tance, five hundred people, twenty would not find provi&s;ion.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marcus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! but I would have the oxen bigger like|wi&s;e.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how many of &s;uch oxen might be put to graze within a common meadow?</P>

<P>Truly, but a very few indeed.</P>

<P>I &s;ee then, that for want of pa&s;ture, we &s;hould &s;oon want cattle</P>

<P>Well then, there is but one thing more to order and the matter is &s;ettled. We mu&s;t have the world grow bigger al&s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing puzzles you, I &s;ee. To be a few yards taker, you would at a minute's notice, &s;tretch all nature. 'Tis a great thought indeed: and yet, I fancy, you would be far from finding any capital advantage, after every thing were &s;ettled a you wi&s;hed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>And why not, dear papa?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>You can &s;ee your&s;elf, papa: he does not reach my ear.</P>
</SP>

<P>Come now, and &s;tand by me. Now which is &s;horte&s;t?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marcus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am; unfortunately.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>It &s;eems then, Marcus, you are at once both big and little?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marcus.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, papa: I beg your pardon, I am neither big nor little, to &s;peak properly. I am big re&s;pecting Frederic; but I am little with re&s;pect to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if we were to grow, all three toge|ther, ten times taller, would you then be le&s;s re&s;pecting me, or bigger in re&s;pect to Frederic, than you are at pre&s;ent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marcus.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, papa: for there would always be an equal difference.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then that is what proportion means. It is a regular gradation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marcus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! I under&s;tand you now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>In that ca&s;e, let us come back to your idea. If, in nature, every thing were to become bigger, &s;till pre&s;erving its pre&s;ent proportion, you would be exactly at the point whence you fir&s;t of all &s;et out. You would not then be capable of frighting people in their garrets, by ju&s;t looking at them through the window; you would find it no le&s;s difficult to wade acro&s;s the water, or drive piles without a&s;&s;i&s;tance, than at pre&s;ent; and be equally unable to twi&s;t off, as you expre&s;&s;ed it, a bull's neck, or &s;end him up two hundred yards into the air: he would be &s;till much bigger than your&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marcus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes; I &s;ee he would.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Frederic, have you heard us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frederic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, papa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>And under&s;tood the meaning of propor|tion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frederic.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;hall &s;ee. Proportion is when any one grows bigger, and another does the &s;ame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>But can you give me an example?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frederic.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe, I can <STAGE>(after having thought a little)</STAGE> as thus: It would be in vain for me to tell my brother, with a boa&s;t, that when three years were pa&s;t, I &s;hould be
<PB N="16" REF="20">three years older: he would &s;till be olde&s;t, as he al&s;o would be three years older than he is at pre&s;ent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excellently well conceived! And thus, though you &s;hould grow as large in &s;tature as our cherry|tree; our cherry-tree, in turn, would have grown larger al&s;o, by the difference now between you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frederic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, that is plain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Could you, in that ca&s;e, take the cherries with more ea&s;e th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n now you gather currants?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frederic.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, papa, I &s;hould then be obliged to come to my ladder and my pole; not the &s;ame as formerly, for they would not &s;erve me any longer. In this ca&s;e it would be nece&s;&s;ary that the proportion &s;hould be &s;till pre&s;erved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>And would the carriages then pa&s;s between your legs?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frederic.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, certainly: I &s;hould be &s;till obliged to keep upon the pavement, if I would not have them throw me down.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what advantage, Marcus, would you then derive from &s;uch a general change of nature as your pride would introduce?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marcus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not &s;ee any.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your wi&s;hes then were ab&s;urd, &s;ince the accompli&s;hment of them could not have made you more happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marcus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly you are right, papa. It would have been much better if we had wi&s;hed to be little;&mdash;yes, quite little.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frederic.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, as little, brother, as Gulliver's Lilli|putians?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marcus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! Another &s;trange conceit! And what can be your motives to this wi&s;h?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marcus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e among a number of good con&s;e|quences, one &s;hould never fear a famine; &s;ince a handful of wheat would make bread enough to &s;erve a family for four and twenty hours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, truly, there might be &s;ome &s;avings!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marcus.</SPEAKER>
<P>And be&s;ides, we &s;hould not then have cau&s;e to go to war with one another, as a place no bigger than our garden, would be large enough to build a mighty city. Men therefore, having much more room than they want,
<PB N="17" REF="21">would never go to war with one another (as I have heard you &s;ay that they do) to obtain an inch or two of land.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would not an&s;wer for them in that point, acquainted as I am with human folly: but I will not di&s;|turb &s;o charming an arrangement by my fears; and there|fore am contented to &s;uppo&s;e that I &s;ee both peace and plenty flouri&s;hing among us, and the golden age, thanks to your good management, brought back again among us!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marcus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! that is not all. My tutor tells me, little creatures are a deal more delicate and perfect in them|&s;elves than great ones; have a much more piercing &s;ight, a finer &s;en&s;e of hearing; and in &s;mell are much &s;uperior. Is that true, papa?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>In general.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marcus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus then were we le&s;s by a great deal than at pre&s;ent, we &s;hould &s;ee, and hear, and &s;mell many things, of which, at pre&s;ent, we have no knowledge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>The&s;e advantages, it is true, are very pre|cious; yet I own, I &s;hould be &s;orry to renounce, for &s;uch advantages, the univer&s;al empire which we now exerci&s;e on every thing that breathes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marcus.</SPEAKER>
<P>There would be no occa&s;ion to renounce it; for remember, you have often told me, that man bears rule much more by his under&s;tanding, than mere &s;trength of body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; becau&s;e his &s;trength of body is exactly proportioned to his under&s;tanding. But be&s;tow upon a Lilliputian's frame the greate&s;t and &s;ublime&s;t ge|nius; give him even our inventions, and our arts ad|vanced to that perfection which they po&s;&s;e&s;s among us; do you think that he would be able to employ our &s;lighte&s;t in&s;truments, and manage properly the meane&s;t of our numberle&s;s machines or engines? How would he defend him&s;elf again&s;t wild bea&s;ts, when even the dog that he keeps within his dwelling, would, without de&s;igning any mi&s;chief, cru&s;h him under foot?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marcus.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then, if every thing becomes proportion|ably little? There, I think, I have you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>

The inferior animals would &s;till have finer organs, and more delicate &s;en&s;ations; and perhaps too, with his littlene&s;s, which could not but be laughed at, he would take upon him, as you do, to alter and reform the uni|ver&s;e.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I feel the &s;ear indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frederic.</SPEAKER>
<P>What plea&s;ure it would be to play with Pom|pey, and not fear his biting me. And be&s;ides, when I were old enough to be a &s;oldier, and go fight, I &s;hould, in that ca&s;e, laugh at balls and bullets. Nay, my head would blunt the broade&s;t &s;word that &s;truck it: would not that be va&s;tly pretty?</P>

<P>Oh, I do not mean &s;o, papa; I would be living while I had this iron body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how then could it be animated by that blood, and by tho&s;e juices that keep up our life? By what means could its nerves be flexible, and have that &s;en&s;ibility which makes us &s;o expert or ready in the u&s;e of every limb, and readers the enjoyment of our &s;en&s;es &s;o delightful?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frederic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, dear me! this is &s;ad work! I &s;ee my &s;cheme is hardly better than my brother's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marcus.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, papa, &s;ince you are &s;o clever in de&s;troy|ing our plans thus, it is your turn to provide us with a better in their &s;tead.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Linton.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why &s;hould I provide one? I am mar|vellou&s;ly &s;atisfied with that which God's providence has already e&s;tabli&s;hed. Yes, dear children, I am &s;en&s;ible, we are completely furni&s;hed with whatever can promote our happine&s;s; &s;uperior in our conformation to all other ani|mals, we tame, by virtue of our genius, the &s;mall number of tho&s;e which in &s;trength &s;urpa&s;s us. If we have not the rapidity of &s;tags and hor&s;es, we can make that compo&s;i|tion which will overtake the one while he is running from
<PB N="20" REF="24">us, and can mount the other to direct him whither we think proper. We have not the wings of a bird, yet we can give wings to tho&s;e tall trees that grow in &s;cre&s;ts, and can make them carry us to the remote&s;t di&s;tances. Our &s;ight, le&s;s piercing than an in&s;ect's, is not bounded to the narrow &s;pace in which we move about, but can take in an ample horizon, and contemplate the great mi|racles of nature. We are unable to gaze, like an eagle, at the &s;un; but we invent an in&s;trument which &s;eems to draw us nearer to that luminary, &s;o that we may mea&s;ure his immen&s;ity of di&s;tance, and ob&s;erve the place which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in the mid&s;t of an infinity of &s;tars that are ob|&s;cured by his &s;uperior brightne&s;s. Every other &s;en&s;e that we have, contributes likewi&s;e to procure us a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of enjoyments, and effect our &s;afety. Con&s;cious of our genius, we are every day in &s;earch of new di&s;coveries; we di&s;arm the thunder, or el&s;e tell it where to fall; we make one element re&s;i&s;t another; we oppo&s;e the beneficial warmth of fire to the inclemency of fro&s;t; and keep the land from being overflowed by inundations. Sometimes we de&s;cend into the darke&s;t bowels of the earth, and bring out thence tho&s;e precious metals which are purified, and then, by an ingenious mode of mixing them together, form new &s;ub&s;tances; and &s;ometimes we mark out tho&s;e rocks which hang ju&s;t ready, as it were, to fall upon our heads, precipitate them from their height into the vallies, and &s;oon after make them re-a&s;cend in &s;umptuous edifices, or in &s;tately pyramids that hide their &s;ummits in the clouds. The &s;ociety that we form with our fellow crea|tures, for the &s;atisfaction of our mutual wants, obtains us, in return for our own toil, the labour of ten thou&s;and hands, all eager to procure us the conveniencies of life. Upon whatever &s;ide we turn, we have at our command the various productions of the univer&s;e, all brought toge|ther for our u&s;e. The &s;ciences exalt our &s;ouls, and charm our faculties. The arts, by having introduced &s;uch num|berle&s;s machines, a&s;&s;i&s;t us in our labour, or refre&s;h us when we &s;eek repo&s;e. Both memory and reflection give us the advantages enjoyed by all tho&s;e who have preceded us. Together with the plea&s;ing idea of our own per&s;onal exi&s;tence, we derive happine&s;s from others al&s;o, by the virtues of compa&s;&s;ion and beneficence, and by the con|nexions of kindred and of friend&s;hip. Neverthele&s;s, our
<PB N="21" REF="25">happine&s;s depends upon our&s;elves alone, amid the ho&s;t of creatures that &s;urround us, being &s;ure of obtaining it, if we but moderately u&s;e our &s;trength, and make a con&s;tant application of our rea&s;on to the bu&s;ine&s;s of determining our conduct; &s;o that, if we ever interrupt our happine&s;s by going further than we &s;hould do, we have nothing to blame, in that ca&s;e, but our own folly. We then &s;eem children as you are, who, in&s;tead of gratefully enjoying the conveniencies and comforts of our &s;ituation, and cou|rageou&s;ly enduring its few evils, vex our&s;elves with wi&s;h|ing for ideal ble&s;&s;ings, or di&s;grace our nature by a lack of manly courage.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vincent.</SPEAKER>
<P>What you call beneficence, dear lady, in me, is no more than duty.

<P>How?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fir&s;t then, at &s;ix in Summer, and at eight in Winter, they are dre&s;&s;ed completely for the day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leonora.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then they do not &s;leep enough, and mu&s;t be very heavy long before night comes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>On the contrary, they are bri&s;ker far than you, becau&s;e they go to bed at ten every night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leonora.</SPEAKER>
<P>To bed at ten!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>At ten; that they may get up early in the morning. When you are fa&s;t a&s;leep in bed, they have received their le&s;&s;ons in geography and cyphering. When the clock &s;trikes ten, they take their needle-work in hand till noon; and then a&s;&s;i&s;t their mother in the hou&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leonora.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does their mother mean to make them hou&s;e|maids?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>She may hope, by means of &s;uch an education, to procure them &s;omething better. But, however that be, &s;hould they not be taught to govern &s;ervants, regulate a table, and conduct their hou&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leonora.</SPEAKER>
<P>And after dinner are they bu&s;y?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not bu&s;y? They have then their harp&s;i|chord, or writing; and at night, a&s;&s;emble round a table, where they read by turns in the Spectator, or Mi&s;s Moore's la&s;t publication, <HI>Sacred Dramas;</HI> while the two that are not occupied upon their book; employ them&s;elves in mending their own clothes, or examining the linen of the hou&s;e, and mending it, if needful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leonora.</SPEAKER>
<P>So then they never take any recreation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I beg your pardon! They amu&s;e them|&s;elves as if they were three queens; for all the&s;e ta&s;ks are intermixed with little &s;ports, and plea&s;ant conver&s;ation. They pay vi&s;its al&s;o, and receive them; but take care to have their work-bags, and I never &s;aw them idle for a minute.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leonora.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is certainly what Mr. Vincent meant. And yet my aunt has often told me, that &s;uch an educa|tion as, according to your account, the Mi&s;s Sharps receive, is only fit for trade&s;men's children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing them to be trade&s;men's children, would they find this education u&s;ele&s;s to them? They &s;hould certainly know hou&s;hold work, or how will they be able to direct a &s;ervant? If they know nothing of it, every one will join to cheat them; and the richer they
<PB N="38" REF="42">may be, the greater probability there is that even the &s;er|vants whom they employ, will join each other to effect their ruin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leonora.</SPEAKER>
<P>I prote&s;t you fright me! I know nothing of the work about a hou&s;e! &s;carce how to hold a needle! Yet I have ju&s;t been told, that we have nothing in the world, except what Mr. Vincent's bounty gives us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah dear &s;i&s;ter &s;o much the wor&s;e for us! &s;hould he leave us, or &s;hould we unfortunately lo&s;e him&mdash;But po&s;&s;ibly my aunt is rich?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leonora.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no; &s;he told me to the contrary &s;carce half an hour ago. She has no more than is &s;ufficient for her|&s;elf. In ca&s;e then any accident &s;hould happen with re|&s;pect to Mr. Vincent, what would be our &s;ate?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould be at fir&s;t put to difficulties; but my ma&s;ter tells me that I &s;hould tru&s;t in God, and hope that he never would for&s;ake me. His opinion is, that there are always generous people in the world, who&s;e friend&s;hip may be gained by an exertion of one's &s;kill to &s;erve them in the way of &s;ome profe&s;&s;ion, and who fre|quently create employment for the indu&s;trious. Thus then, in the cour&s;e of &s;ome few years, when I am more advan|ced in learning, I might undertake to teach &s;uch children as know le&s;s than I do. I &s;hould even improve my&s;elf by &s;uch an occupation, and with good behaviour on my part, be &s;ure of living with &s;ome &s;ort of ea&s;e and comfort, and perhaps &s;trike out a way to fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leonora.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what benefit could I derive from all my &s;kill in dancing, or in drawing, or in mu&s;ic? I &s;hould die perhaps of hunger, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e vain accom|pli&s;hments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>And therefore Mr. Vincent cannot be well plea&s;ed when he di&s;covers that you have been put to no|thing but tho&s;e arts which &s;erve for ornament or plea&s;ure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leonora.</SPEAKER>
<P>And vexation &s;ometimes, David; for when I dance, or &s;ing in company, if I am not prai&s;ed as much as I &s;uppo&s;e my&s;elf to merit, you cannot think how much I am fretted at the di&s;appointment!&mdash;Shall I al&s;o tell you that I am often tired of tho&s;e fine matters, which my aunt &s;ays &s;erve us to pa&s;s time away with &s;atisfaction.</P>

<HEAD>THE PROPER USE OF TIME.</HEAD>
<P>MORGAN, though a plain companion, was a &s;pe|cial workman. He a&s;pired at nothing in his heart &s;o much as to become a ma&s;ter; but he wanted money to &s;et up.</P>
<P>A merchant, who was well acquainted with his indu&s;try, was willing to &s;upply him with an hundred pounds, that he might open &s;hop.</P>
<P>One may, without much difficulty, gue&s;s at Morgan's joy. In his imagination, he already had a warehou&s;e full of goods. He reckoned up how many cu&s;tomers would crowd to buy them, and what money he &s;hould have at balancing his books.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the extravagant emotions of that tran&s;port into which the&s;e notions threw him, he perceived an ale-hou&s;e. Come, &s;aid he, and entered it, I will have a little plea|&s;ure with one &s;ixpence of this money.</P>
<P>He demurred, however, &s;ome few moments, to call out for punch which was his favourite liquor, as his con|&s;cience loudly told him that the moment of enjoyment was not yet arrived; that he was, fir&s;t of all, to think of paying what his friend had lent him; and at pre&s;ent that it was not hone&s;t for him to lay out a penny of the &s;um for things not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. He was ready to come out again, impre&s;&s;ed by &s;uch right notions, but be|thought him&s;elf, on the other hand, that if he &s;pent a &s;ixpence of his money, he &s;hould &s;till have ninety-nine pounds nineteen &s;hillings and a &s;ixpence left; that &s;uch a &s;um was full enough to &s;et him up in trade, and that a &s;ingle half-hour's indu&s;try would compen&s;ate for &s;uch a trifling plea&s;ure as he wi&s;hed to have at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>It was thus, that taking up the gla&s;s, he &s;ought to quiet his interior &s;cruples; but alas, his pre&s;ent conduct was to open him a door to ruin.</P>
<P>On the morrow, &s;o agreeable a recollection of his plea|&s;ure at the ale-hou&s;e filled his mind, that he was now le&s;s &s;crupulous with con&s;cience in expentling one more &s;ixpence at it. He had ninety-nine pounds nineteen &s;hillings &s;till remaining.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="54">On the following days, the love of liquor had be&s;otted him in &s;uch a manner, that he con&s;tantly returned to his beloved ale-hou&s;e, but increa&s;ed the quantum of his liquor, to a &s;hilling's worth at fir&s;t; then &s;ixpence more; and &s;o on, till he came to half-a-crown; at which he &s;eemed to make a &s;tand, and every time, he could con&s;ole him&s;elf with &s;aying, It is but two-and-&s;ixpence that I am &s;pend|ing. Oh, I need not fear but I &s;hall have enough to carry on my trade.</P>
<P>Such then was his delu&s;ive way of rea&s;oning, in reply to what his con&s;cience whi&s;pered, which would now and then be heard. It did not &s;trike him, that his fortune was an even hundred pounds, and that the u&s;eful applica|tion of the whole depended on the fit employ to which he put its parts.</P>
<P>You &s;ee then, my dear little friends, how by in&s;en&s;ible gradation he at length plunged into a life of extravagance. He found no longer any joy in indu&s;try, employed en|tirely as he was in contemplating on his pre&s;ent riches, which he fancied inexhau&s;tible; and yet, from day to day, he did not fail to find that it was dimini&s;hing. He was convinced, and his conviction all at once came over him ju&s;t like a clap of thunder, that he could not make amends for his preceding di&s;&s;ipation, as his benefactor would not be &s;o fond of lending him another hundred pounds, when he had &s;een him &s;o mi&s;u&s;e the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Quite overcome with &s;hame and grief, the more he &s;ought to &s;tifle his ideas with hard drinking, &s;o much the &s;ooner by a great deal, did his ruin fall upon him. And at la&s;t the frightful moment came, when quite di&s;gu&s;ted at the thought of indu&s;try, and being, as it were, an ob|ject of horror to him&s;elf, he regarded life as a burthen, &s;ince it pre&s;ented him with nothing but a pro&s;pect of mi|&s;erable poverty whenever he looked forward.</P>
<P>He renounced his country, followed by de&s;pair, and joined a gang of &s;mugglers, formidable for the ravages which they &s;pread through every country on the coa&s;t. But Heaven did not permit their violence to remain long unpuni&s;hed. A di&s;graceful death &s;oon ended his career of wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>Alas! if when his rea&s;on fir&s;t of all addre&s;&s;ed him, he had li&s;tened to the reproaches of his con&s;cience, ea&s;y in
<PB N="51" REF="55">his &s;ituation he might now have been enjoying, in re|pute and honour, the ea&s;e of a re&s;pectable and opulent old age.</P>
<P>You &s;hudder, children, at his lamentable folly. Such is notwith&s;tanding that of multitudes among us, in the u&s;e which they make of life. It was be&s;towed upon them that they might live happy in virtuous enjoyments, and yet they lavi&s;h it upon every &s;hameful di&s;&s;ipation. They think that there will always be time enough left them, for the proper u&s;e thereof. However, in the interval, days, months, and years flow onward, and they find, at the conclu&s;ion of them, they have not made &s;uch a u&s;e as they fondly propo&s;ed.

<HEAD>THE BLACKSMITH.</HEAD>
<P>A Gentleman of fortune pa&s;&s;ing very late one night before a black&s;mith's habitation, was &s;urprized to &s;ee him bu&s;y at his forge, when every per&s;on in the neigh|bourhood was gone to re&s;t. He had a curio&s;ity to know what rea&s;on he could have for working thus at midnight, and if twelve hours labour in the day would not &s;uffice him to provide &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for his family.</P>
<P>I do not work for my&s;elf, replied the black&s;mith, but for a neighbour here of mine, who has unfortunately been burnt out. I ri&s;e two hours before the u&s;ual time of labour every morning, and continue working two hours after at at lea&s;t, and &s;ometimes longer, as is now the ca&s;e, and this I do, that I may help him in his de&s;titute condition. If I had but any thing my&s;elf, I would divide it with him; but my all is nothing, except this &s;hop, and &s;ome &s;mall &s;tock of metal, which I cannot &s;ell, becau&s;e it is what &s;ub&s;i&s;ts me. Thus I work every day four hours ex|traordinary, which amounts to two days in the cour&s;e of a week, and the earnings of tho&s;e two days I can yield to him. Thank heaven, at this time of the year there is
<PB N="52" REF="56">work enough! and while I have but &s;trength, it is my duty to a&s;&s;i&s;t the unhappy.</P>
<P>This is very generous, my good friend, on your part, &s;aid the gentleman, as I &s;uppo&s;e your neighbour never will be able to repay your kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>Truly, &s;ir, I fear he will not: but I fear it on his account alone, not mine. However, I am &s;ure he would rejoice to do as much for me, were I in his condition.</P>
<P>At the&s;e words, the gentleman, not wi&s;hing to intrude upon the black&s;mith any longer, wi&s;hed him a good night, and went away.</P>
<P>Upon the morrow, having put into his pur&s;e a note for twenty pounds, which he could afford to give away, he went out, and meant to leave it with the black&s;mith, who&s;e beneficence he was re&s;olved to recompence, by putting it in his power to buy whatever metal he might want, at the cheape&s;t market, to undertake more bu&s;ine&s;s, and to lay by a little from his labour, to &s;upport him in old age.</P>
<P>But what was his &s;urprize, when the black&s;mith bade him take his money back again! I cannot lay it out, &s;aid he, becau&s;e I have not earned it. I can well afford to pay for all the iron that I u&s;e, and if ever I &s;hould be in want of more, the merchant would &s;upply me with it, on my note. It would be ab&s;olute ingratitude in me to take that profit from him which he is u&s;ed to make upon his goods, when he has never he&s;itated to &s;upply me with as much as I could a&s;k, even when I had no other coat than that upon my back: but you may make a better u&s;e, &s;ir, of this money, if you lend it, free of intere&s;t, to my unhappy neighbour. He might then recover his affairs, and I &s;leep out my belly full.</P>

<HEAD>THE GENEROUS ORPHAN.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. Fairborne had hardly lo&s;t her hu&s;band, when a law &s;uit in which he had been engaged was deter|mined to her di&s;advantage; the greate&s;t part of her po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions being dependent on the verdict. She was under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;elling all her furniture, and &s;ome few jewels; after which, when &s;he had placed the produce at a bank|er's, &s;he withdrew into a village, where the nece&s;&s;ary things of life were not &s;o high, and where &s;he apprehend|ed that &s;he might live with tolerable decency upon her trifling income.</P>
<P>Hardly had &s;he pa&s;&s;ed a month or two in her retreat, before &s;he was given to under&s;tand that her banker was gone off, and all her money with him. Let any one ima|gine the horror of her &s;ituation. Grief and &s;ickne&s;s had long &s;ince di&s;abled her from doing any thing like labour for her livelihood; and after having pa&s;&s;ed her youth in ea&s;e and plea&s;ure, &s;he had no re&s;ources left her in old age, except an alms-hou&s;e, or the common refuge of the poor, beggary.</P>
<P>In reality, there was not one of her acquaintance who would conde&s;cend to have the lea&s;t degree of intere&s;t in her &s;ufferings. Brought by her beloved hu&s;band from a foreign country, &s;he had no one to whom &s;he could fly for a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. None, except a tolerably near relation, whom &s;he her|&s;elf had brought to England; and whom, by granting him her hu&s;band's credit, &s;he had rendered wealthy. But this man, a pattern of &s;ordid avarice, was not likely to relieve another, when he would not even allow him&s;elf the nece&s;&s;ary things of life.</P>
<P>In this helple&s;s &s;ituation, there was, luckily, one re|&s;ource &s;till left for her &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. In the years of her pro&s;perity, &s;he had adopted a young female orphan, named Clarinda, and &s;he now became her guardian angel. Mrs. Fairborne's former kindne&s;&s;es in&s;pired her with a wi&s;h of &s;hewing that &s;he was grateful for them.</P>
<P>No, &s;aid &s;he, (when her unhappy mi&s;tre&s;s mentioned her de&s;ign of &s;eeking the a&s;ylum of a pari&s;h work-hou&s;e.) I will never leave you. From your tenderne&s;s, I for|merly
<PB N="54" REF="58">received the treatment of a child; and, if in your pro&s;perity I thought it &s;o de&s;irable to be related to you by adoption, I &s;till think it more &s;o, now, in your adver|&s;ity.</P>
<P>Thank Heaven and your adoption, I live comfortably. Your maternal conduct was evinced in teaching me all nece&s;&s;ary female arts; I &s;hall, at pre&s;ent, therefore, look upon it as a boa&s;t, that I can exerci&s;e my knowledge for your &s;ake. With health and courage, I &s;hall be at lea&s;t enabled to procure a living for us both.</P>
<P>The unhappy widow was exceedingly affected at this generous offer. She embraced Clarinda, and with joy con&s;ented to accept it.</P>
<P>We are now then to &s;uppo&s;e Clarinda, in her turn, be|come the mother, by adoption, of her former benefactre&s;s. She was far from thinking it enough to feed her with the produce of an unremitting labour; &s;he con&s;oled her in affliction, aided her in &s;ickne&s;s, and endeavoured by the tendere&s;t cares, to make up for all the inju&s;tice of her lot.</P>
<P>The con&s;tancy and ardour of her attention did not relax a moment for two years, in which long time her mi&s;tre&s;s was made happy by her bounty; and when death removed her, &s;he lamented with &s;incerity, what &s;he con&s;idered as a grievous lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Some little &s;ea&s;on af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er this, died al&s;o the kin&s;man above-mentioned, who had &s;hewn him&s;elf &s;o utterly in|&s;en&s;ible to every claim of gratitude and kindred. As he could not take his money with him, he &s;uppo&s;ed it would be making &s;ome atonement for his want of natu|ral affection, if he left the injured lady all his for|tune.</P>
<P>But this &s;uccour came too late, as Mrs. Fairborne was not able to avail her&s;elf thereof, &s;he had not even the con&s;olation, at her death, of knowing that &s;uch a change had happened in her fortune; as in that ca&s;e, &s;he might ea&s;ily have turned it to the benefit of her affection|ate Clarinda.</P>
<P>The inheritance in que&s;tion therefore fell, for want of heir&s;hip, to the King. As Providence would have it, the enquiries made on &s;uch a rare occurrence, brought him to a knowledge of the generous orphan's conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="59">Ah! &s;aid he, Clarinda merits this inheritance; and therefore I renounce my rights to favour her's; and will be happy to approve my&s;elf her friend and father.</P>
<P>All the nation joined in the applau&s;e of &s;uch a liberal action; and Clarinda, when po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this honourable recompence of her gratitude, employed it in maintaining orphans, &s;uch as &s;he had been; and took the greate&s;t plea|&s;ure in in&s;piring them with &s;entiments, like tho&s;e by which &s;he had her&s;elf de&s;erved her fortune.</P>

<HEAD>THE DIRTY BOOTS.</HEAD>
<P>FORTUNATUS, proud of his high birth, was not content with inwardly de&s;pi&s;ing every one inferior to him&s;elf in point of fortune, but pre&s;umed to take &s;uch airs upon him as evinced the &s;corn with which he viewed them. As it chanced, one day he &s;aw his father's foot|man cleaning &s;hoes! Fooh! what a filthy bu&s;ine&s;s! cried he, as he pa&s;&s;ed him, turning up his no&s;e: for all the world I would not be a &s;hoe-black.&mdash;Very likely, &s;aid John; and I, for my part, hope that I &s;hall never be <HI>your</HI> &s;hoe-black.</P>
<P>All the la&s;t week's weather had been very bad, but now it was grown clear and bright; on which account young Fortunatus received his father's permi&s;&s;ion to take a ride on hor&s;eback. Now the promi&s;e of this ride afforded him the greater plea&s;ure, as the day before, when he was out, he had been hindered, by a heavy &s;hower of rain, from going far. However, he had been already far enough to &s;pla&s;h his boots from top to bottom, and they were not yet quite dry.</P>
<P>Tran&s;ported with the thought of his ride, he ran down to John, who was at breakfa&s;t in the kitchen, and with an imperious tone of voice, cried out, "John, John! I am going out on hor&s;eback! Run and clean my bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts! do you hear me?" John pretended that he did not, and continued at his breakfa&s;t, quite compo&s;ed. In vain For|tunatus put him&s;elf into a pa&s;&s;ion, and called him a hun|dred names. John contented him&s;elf with an&s;wering him
<PB N="56" REF="60">very calmly, "I have told you, &s;ir, already, if you re|collect, that I hoped never to become <HI>your</HI> &s;hoe-black."</P>
<P>In the mean time Fortunatus, &s;eeing he could not, in &s;pite of all his menaces, prevail upon John to do as he de&s;ired, returned quite full of rage, and made complaint about him to his father. Mr. Railton could not compre|hend why John refu&s;ed a bu&s;ine&s;s that belonged to his em|ployment, and which hitherto he had performed without expecting orders for that purpo&s;e; &s;o he &s;ent to &s;peak a little with him, and was told of the affair.</P>
<P>His conduct was fully approved by Mr. Railton, who not only blamed his &s;on, but told him that he might go and clean his boots him&s;elf, or &s;tay at home, which ever he thought proper. He forbade the other &s;ervants to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in this bu&s;ine&s;s. "You will learn, &s;ir, (added he,) how filly it is to look with &s;corn on &s;ervices that contribute to our comfort and convenience; &s;ervices, the rigour of which you &s;hould rather &s;trive to &s;often, by a gentlene&s;s of manners in your&s;elf. Therefore, &s;ince a <HI>&s;hoe-black's</HI> trade is &s;o di&s;graceful, be &s;o kind as to ennoble it, by being for the future your own &s;hoe-black."</P>
<P>Such a &s;entence turned his promi&s;ed plea&s;ure into &s;or|row. He was very eager for a ride on hor&s;eback, it was &s;uch fine weather; but&mdash;to clean his boots him&s;elf! he could not &s;toop to &s;uch an office. On the other hand, his pride would not permit him to go out with dirty boots, in which ca&s;e every one that he met would ridicule him. He applied &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to every &s;ervant in the hou&s;e, with offers of money to corrupt them; but not one could be per&s;uaded to di&s;obey his ma&s;ter's order. Thus, then, For|tunatus was obliged to &s;tay at home, till in the end his pride permitted him to &s;toop &s;o low as the conditions laid upon him. On the next day John re&s;umed his office with|out bidding; and the humbled Fortunatus, having ex|erci&s;ed it once, would never afterwards gratify his pride, by vilifying what was in it&s;elf &s;o u&s;eful.</P>

<HEAD>THE TATLER.</HEAD>
<P>AURELIA, though &s;ufficiently good-tempered, had contracted one great fault, and that was calumny. She publi&s;hed every where whatever &s;he perceived ami&s;s in others, though they were her deare&s;t friends. The in|experience of her age induced her very often to a&s;cribe indifferent actions to improper motives; and a &s;ingle word or volatility of di&s;po&s;ition, was enough to make her form the wor&s;t &s;u&s;picions which, as &s;oon as &s;he had formed them, &s;he would run into company, and broach as if they were undoubted facts. She frequently even added circum|&s;tances to them drawn from her imagination, only with a view of making them more likely. You may ea&s;ily con|ceive what mi&s;chiefs &s;uch a conduct mu&s;t produce. It was not long before one family was &s;et again&s;t another in her neighbourhood. The di&s;cord afterwards affected indivi|duals: wives and hu&s;bands, brothers, ma&s;ters and, do|me&s;tics, were at everla&s;ting variance with each other. Mu|tual confidence was on a &s;udden done away from tho&s;e who&s;e company the little girl frequented with her mother. People went &s;o far, at la&s;t, as to &s;hut up their doors again&s;t her, as they would have done again&s;t a wretched creature tainted with the plague; but neither hatred nor humiliation could correct a vice which cu&s;tom had &s;o deep|ly rivetted within her heart.</P>
<P>This glory was re&s;erved for Dorinda, her cou&s;in, who was the only per&s;on now that would receive her vi&s;its, and return them; as &s;he always lived in hopes of being able, in the end, to &s;hew her the enormity of her behaviour, and pre&s;erve her life from &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Aurelia went one day to &s;ee her cou&s;in, and em|ployed an hour or two in telling &s;piteful tales of all their common friends, although &s;he knew with what unea&s;i|ne&s;s her cou&s;in heard them. It was all the &s;ame to her.</P>
<P>And now, dear Dorinda, &s;aid Mi&s;s Aurelia, having &s;topped for want of breath, your turn is come to tell me &s;omething. You &s;ee company enough to have a &s;tock of little anecdotes at all times ready on your hands.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="62">My dear Aurelia, an&s;wered Dorinda, whenever I am vi&s;iting my friends, I wi&s;h to ta&s;te the plea&s;ure of their company; and am not &s;uch an idiot, as to lo&s;e it by remarking their defects. Be&s;ides I find within my&s;elf &s;o many, that I cannot po&s;&s;ibly have time to think of tho&s;e in others; having every need of their indulgence, I am wi&s;e enough to grant them mine. I rather chu&s;e to rivet my attention upon every commendable quality which they po&s;&s;e&s;s, and &s;o endeavour to acquire it. One mu&s;t be in a faultle&s;s &s;tate one's &s;elf, before one can pro|ceed to note the faults of others. I congratulate you on this faultle&s;s &s;tate, which I, on the contrary, am &s;o unhappy as to want. Continue, cou&s;in, this employment of a cha|ritable cen&s;or, who would lead mankind to virtue by ex|po&s;ing the deformity of vice. You cannot fail of merit|ing the e&s;teem of others for &s;uch generous cares.</P>
<P>Aurelia could not fail of being con&s;cious that &s;he was, long are this, become a public object of aver&s;ion and di&s;gu&s;t; and therefore felt the &s;everity of her cou|&s;in's &s;arca&s;m. She began from that day forward, to reflect with real &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s upon the danger of her in|di&s;cretion. She even trembled at the recollection of tho&s;e mi&s;chiefs that &s;he had cau&s;ed, and now determi|ned to prevent their progre&s;s. It was difficult in the beginning, to throw off a cu&s;tom which &s;he had long indulged, of beholding things on the unfavourable &s;ide; but what can with&s;tand a &s;teady re&s;olution? In the end, &s;he was &s;o totally reformed, that &s;he applied her penetration to &s;uch objects only as de&s;erved applau&s;e; and the dete&s;table enjoyments of malignity within her, were &s;ucceeded by a purer &s;atisfaction. She was now become the fir&s;t to &s;et equivocal or doubtful actions in &s;uch points of view, that others might excu&s;e them. When &s;he could not put them in a favourable light, it is likely, &s;he would &s;ay, I do not know every cir|cum&s;tance attending them: no doubt, there were com|mendable motives, &s;uch as I am not acquainted with. In &s;hort, whenever, as it &s;ometimes chanced, the ca&s;e would not admit of any thing approaching to the na|ture of indulgence, &s;he would pity the offending per|&s;on, and impute her fault to too great precipitation or ignorance of the mi&s;chief that &s;he was committing.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="63">However, it was very long indeed, before &s;he could regain tho&s;e hearts, which her former manners had alienated. She was come, by this time, to the age when mo&s;t young women think of being &s;ettled, but could &s;ee no pro&s;pect of a hu&s;band. People had avoid|ed her with &s;o much care for years, that now &s;he &s;eem|ed as much forgotten, as if &s;he had withdrawn her&s;elf into a convent from the world.</P>
<P>No wonder then that &s;he &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e her&s;elf con|demned to pa&s;s her days in &s;olitude, deprived of all tho&s;e plea&s;ures which accompany a happy marriage, and the enjoyment of a cho&s;en &s;et of friends: but for|tune determined otherwi&s;e; for a gentleman, who came upon a vi&s;it to her father, having heard her generou&s;ly undertake to &s;hield the reputation of an ab&s;ent per|&s;on whom &s;ome one in the company accu&s;ed, was &s;o delighted with a goodne&s;s like his own, as to con|clude that &s;he was exactly of the turn of mind that would make him happy. He &s;olicited her hand, and made her mi&s;tre&s;s in return both of his heart, and his fortune.</P>
<P>Aurelia, more and more convinced of the pernicious con&s;equences of blazing other people's faults, and the delightful &s;atisfaction which &s;elf-e&s;teem, and the re|&s;pect of worthy people cannot but be&s;tow;&mdash;of wor|thy people! repeat, who wink at the defects of human nature;&mdash;every day propo&s;es her example to his chil|dren, to pre&s;erve them from the ruin that &s;he had near|ly &s;uffered.</P>
<P>She has given me leave to write her &s;tory in this book, for the in&s;truction of my little friends; if there be any like her who may read it. I, for my part, know not whether there are any &s;uch: but if there &s;hould be, I per&s;uade my|&s;elf, that after the in&s;truction of this &s;tory, they will be the better for it.</P>

<HEAD>JULIAN AND ROSINA.</HEAD>
<P>ONCE upon a time a certain Mr. Lorimer was reading in a corner of his parlour, while his wife and daugh|ter were employed, in &s;ilence, at their tambour-frame; when, on a &s;udden, their little Julian entered ha&s;tily, quite out of breath, his eye brim-full of tears, his hair in great di&s;order, and one &s;tocking down upon his heel. He had a raquet in his hand; and as he entered, he cried out, Come, mama, do pray, and &s;ee the mother of poor Chri&s;topher and Frederic. Alas! they have not had a bit of any thing to eat all day. Frederic a&s;ked me to play with him at &s;huttlecock, to make him forget, as he &s;aid, that he was hungry; and they do not know how they &s;hall get any thing before to-morrow evening, at the &s;oone&s;t. I would fain have given them all the money in my pur&s;e; but, would you think it? they refu&s;ed it. I made an&s;wer, Come with me, and you &s;hall &s;ee&mdash;No, no, &s;aid they; we are already &s;o obliged to your mama, and dare not go again to teaze her. Then too, their poor mother, hear|ing this, bur&s;t out a weeping.&mdash;But I mu&s;t not cry, &s;aid Julian, (crying &s;till more,) as my papa is reading. Ah! Ro&s;ina, had you &s;een them, you would certainly have cried as much as I! and &s;tooping as he &s;poke, he laid hold of Ro&s;ina's apron by the corner, to wipe his eyes.</P>
<P>The mother, melted into tears at this recital, and the little boy's behaviour thereupon, dropped her needle;
<PB N="64" REF="68">and the father, to conceal a tear, held up his book before him.</P>
<P>Come, dear children, then, &s;aid Mrs. Lorimer, em|bracing Julian and Ro&s;ina with affection, come and let us &s;ee if we can help the&s;e three unhappy people.</P>
<P>While Frederic, Chri&s;topher, and the afflicted mother, knelt before their benefactre&s;s, Ro&s;ina pulled her brother by the coat, and in a whi&s;per a&s;ked him if he recollected that nice little cake which their uncle gave them in the morning? Yes, &s;aid Julian, and turned round as if he meant to run and fetch it. Keep mama in conver&s;ation here, and make believe as if you did not know that I was gone; for I will run and fetch it. No, no, &s;aid Ro&s;ina, there is no need of that; for look, it is here.&mdash;On which the little lady, lifting up poor Frederic's hat, that lay accidentally on the table, &s;hewed her brother the nice little cake, which &s;he had watched the opportunity of &s;lipping underneath it.</P>

<HEAD>THE MOUNTAIN LUTE.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the highe&s;t &s;ummit of tho&s;e hills which over|look the vale of Lucca in Savoy, I was contemplating the extended land&s;cape round about me: I was quite alone, my faithful &s;ervant being left in a neighbouring city, with orders not to expect me till at the end of three days; which interval I meant to &s;pend in rambling over that romantic country. More than half way down the hill, I &s;aw a hamlet, which a&s;&s;ured me of a lodging for the night. Thus free from all inquietude, and &s;wallowed up in thought, I let my mind roam at large in contem|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation, and my eye to wander from one object to another of the &s;pacious view. But &s;oon the &s;ylvan chori&s;ters la&s;t &s;ong admoni&s;hed me to think of retiring under cover for the night. The &s;un, already hid behind the oppo&s;ite mountain, did but colour with his gold and purple rays the clouds which floated, as it were, ju&s;t clo&s;e above the trees that crown its &s;ummit. I de&s;cended &s;lowly, morti|fied to &s;ee the &s;pacious horizon, who&s;e limits I could hardly trace, contract it&s;elf as I proceeded. The twilight now began to veil it with a &s;hade, which by degrees grew browner, till the empre&s;s of the night di&s;pelled this gloomy darkne&s;s with her &s;ilver beams. I &s;at down for a moment, to enjoy the picture. Nothing intercepted my view, throughout the va&s;t expan&s;e. I contemplated the infinite extent at lei&s;ure. From the trembling moon and &s;tars which twinkled while I gazed upon them, I pa&s;&s;ed over to the calm and &s;potle&s;s azure of the firmament. The air was fre&s;h, nor did the &s;lighte&s;t breeze di&s;turb it. Nature was ab&s;orbed in univer&s;al &s;ilence, &s;aving the low murmur of a &s;tream which meandered through the country at a di&s;tance. Stretched upon the gra&s;s, I might perhaps have contemplated till the ri&s;ing of the &s;un next morning: but the mu&s;ic of a lute, made more harmonious by a voice, &s;oon after &s;truck upon my ear. I thought at fir&s;t that my ravi&s;hed &s;en&s;es were deluded by the power of my imagination, and experienced the delight of fancying my|&s;elf &s;uddenly tran&s;ported in a dream to what are called the regions of enchantment. In the mid&s;t of this illu&s;ion, while both m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ies &s;till continued, A lute! &s;aid I ri&s;ing,
<PB N="85" REF="89">a lute upon the mountain! I turned round to that &s;ide whence the melody proceeded, and di&s;covered through the dark &s;ome verdure of the trees, no great way di&s;tant, the white walls and garden paling of a cottage. I approach|ed it with a beating heart; but what was my &s;urprize, when I beheld a youthful pea&s;ant with a lute, on which he was playing with exqui&s;ite addre&s;s. A woman, &s;eated on his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> hand, was looking at him with an eye of the tendere&s;t affection. At their feet, upon the turf, were many children, boys and girls, and ancient people, all in attitudes of plea&s;ure and attention. When I fir&s;t made my appearance, &s;everal of the children came to meet me, looked at one another, and then &s;aid among them&s;elves, What gentleman is this? The young mu&s;ician turned his head, but did not leave off playing. I could not po&s;&s;ibly with&s;tand the fir&s;t emotions of my heart. I held him out my hand; he gave me his, which I laid hold of with a &s;ort of tran&s;port. Every body upon this ro&s;e and made a circle round us. I informed them, as conci&s;ely as I could do, of my bu&s;ine&s;s in that quarter of the country, and at &s;uch a time of night. We have not an inn, for many miles round, remarked the youthful pea&s;ant, as our ham|let is not near the road; but if you are content to lie in a poor cabin, we will do our be&s;t to entertain you.</P>
<P>If at fir&s;t I was a&s;toni&s;hed at his execution on the lute, and ta&s;te in &s;inging, I was &s;till much more &s;urpri&s;ed at the politene&s;s of his manners, the preci&s;ion of his lan|guage, and the ea&s;e with which he &s;poke. You were not born, &s;aid I to him, in a cabin? Pardon me, replied he with a &s;mile; I <HI>was,</HI> and even in this. But you are fatigued, I &s;uppo&s;e; George, bring a chair. Excu&s;e me, &s;ir; I owe my neighbours this nocturnal entertainment which I am now giving them.</P>
<P>I would not take the chair, but laid my&s;elf upon the gra&s;s, as all the re&s;t did. Every body had, by this time, re&s;umed his former po&s;ture; and the &s;ilence which I had interrupted by appearing as I did among them, now took place again.</P>
<P>The youth began immediately to play upon his lute; and in the intervals of playing, &s;ung a favourite ballad, which he did with &s;o much &s;weetne&s;s, that a tear, as I could &s;ee, &s;tood trembling in the eye of every one about
<PB N="86" REF="90">him, by the time that he had repeated the fir&s;t couplet. I could not refrain from envying the &s;urprizing genius of this ru&s;tic bard, whoever he might be, that could impre&s;s &s;o powerfully an unlettered, and almo&s;t an uncivilized &s;oci|ety of people. I was charmed in &s;eeing how &s;urpri&s;ingly tho&s;e beauties that are drawn from nature, plea&s;e the &s;ouls of all men. Of the poet's touches, none were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; and at the la&s;t, which was the mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, I heard round about me, nothing but &s;ighs, and half &s;tifled &s;obs.</P>
<P>After &s;ome few minutes &s;ilence, the whole company ro&s;e, each wiping, as I could &s;ee, his eyes. They wi&s;hed each other a good night with perfect cordiality. The neighbours, with their children, went away, and none were left, except an ancient man upon a &s;eat be&s;ide the door, and wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m till now I had not noticed; the mu&s;ician, with the woman &s;itting by him; George, the young boy whore name I recollected; and my&s;elf.</P>
<P>It was painful for me to give up the charming &s;tate in which at that time I was plunged. I &s;till continued fitting, but got up at la&s;t, and drawing near the young mu&s;ician, put my arms out, as it were by in&s;tinct, to embrace him. Sweet it is, &s;aid I, to meet with people who &s;urprize us at the fir&s;t &s;light glance, and fini&s;h by attracting our e&s;teem, before a quarter of an hour is pa&s;&s;ed. He an&s;wered me no other way than by an ar|dent gra&s;p of my hand, while I was &s;peaking. Dear &s;ir, began the old man upon this, you are plea&s;ed, I perceive, with our evening's entertainment? I am glad you have conceived &s;o &s;uddenly a friend&s;hip for my dear Valentine, for which you &s;hall repo&s;e you in my bed. No, father, interrapted George, who came running from the barn, I have been littering me &s;ome &s;traw; and the gentleman &s;hall he in <HI>my</HI> bed, if he plea&s;es. I was forced to promi&s;e that I would yield to this la&s;t offer. George, upon this, held out his hand; the old man re&s;ted on his &s;houlder, and went in, after wi&s;hing me a good night: and now I found my&s;elf alone with Valentine, and the young woman, who, he told me, was his &s;pou&s;e. I a&s;ked them, if, for my &s;ake, they would not pa&s;s fifteen minutes more, in conver&s;ation with me, where they then were, as it was moon-light? Willingly, &s;aid Loui&s;a, who was not a little vain of
<PB N="87" REF="91">the attention that I had paid her hu&s;band. Yes, quite willingly, replied Valentine, who &s;aw how much his wife de&s;ired it.</P>
<P>I &s;at down between them, with a linden tree behind me; through who&s;e foliage, the moon darted all her brightne&s;s.</P>
<P>My dear friends, &s;aid I, taking the woman by the hand, pray let me know how long you have enjoyed your pre&s;ent happine&s;s? The&s;e &s;ix months, an&s;wered &s;he; and now it is upwards of a twelvemonth that Valentine is happily returned among us from his travels. You have travelled then? &s;aid I, with &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e, excited by this intimation. Yes, &s;ir, an&s;wered Valentine: I have vi&s;ited a part of Europe.&mdash;Every thing that I &s;ee about you, interrupted I, and every thing that I hear you &s;ay, excites a deal of wonder in me! if you have no &s;ecret motive for concealing the tran&s;actions of your life, do not refu&s;e me, I be&s;eech you, the plea&s;ure of hearing them. Certainly you will not, an&s;wered Loui&s;a, with great &s;implicity. The gentleman &s;eems a very civil kind of a per&s;on. Be&s;ides, I take much plea&s;ure my&s;elf in li&s;tening to them.</P>
<P>He con&s;ented, with a &s;mile, to our reque&s;t and the following narrative is delivered in his own words, as far as my remembrance has pre&s;erved them.</P>
<P>As I have mentioned, I was born, &s;ir, in this cottage, towards the end of the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;ixty-four; being at pre&s;ent, three-and-twenty years of age. I had the misfortune to lo&s;e my mother, when an infant, being hardly weaned. My father was in ea&s;y, though not in affluent circum&s;tances, but a law-&s;uit into which he was forced, by one who is at pre&s;ent no more, but was then a very wealthy farmer, ruined him entirely; and he died of grief, when he was torn from his paternal cottage, and beheld it &s;old for the advantage of the lawyers. The old man whom you &s;aw ju&s;t now, and who is become my father, bought and came to &s;ettle in it. He was &s;truck with pity, &s;eeing me an orphan at my early time of life, and, though I was &s;o little, told me that I &s;hould be his &s;hepherd. I was treated very kindly by him; and his children looked upon me as their brother. Notwith&s;tanding which, the lo&s;s of my poor father, the unkindne&s;s of my other kindred
<PB N="88" REF="92">who for&s;ook me, with the thought of being nothing but a &s;tranger in the cottage where I fir&s;t had my exi&s;tence, and the lonely life that I led upon the mountain, all united to afflict me, and my accu&s;tomed gaiety was changed to melancholy. I con&s;umed whole days in weeping, while my flocks were grazing round me on the plain.</P>
<P>(Here Loui&s;a withdrew her hand, which I held in mine, to wipe away a falling tear, and then returned it me.)</P>
<P>One evening I was &s;itting on the &s;ummit of the moun|tain, and amu&s;ing my afflicted thoughts by &s;inging, to my&s;elf, the very ballad that you have ju&s;t now heard. Towards the conclu&s;ion, I ob&s;erved a man among the trees. I noticed that he was dre&s;&s;ed in brown: his countenance was very pale; he &s;eemed quite melan|choly; and he waited till my &s;ong was fini&s;hed. He then came clo&s;e to me, and enquired how far he might be from the public road? Oh very far, dear &s;ir, &s;aid I; above five miles. Can you conduct me thither? I would do &s;o gladly, but that I cannot quit my flock.&mdash; perhaps your parents may accommodate me with a lodging for the night?&mdash;Ah, &s;ir! my parents are a great way off.&mdash;Where, then?&mdash;They lived like hone&s;t people upon earth, and they are happy now in heaven.</P>
<P>The tone of my voice, as he informed me after|wards, affected this good man, and my reply, he &s;aid, could not but touch him. He put &s;everal que&s;tions to me, and my an&s;wers plea&s;ed him. Night by this time being come, I brought him to our cottage; and my ma&s;ter entertained him ho&s;pitably. On the mor|row, they had &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e together with regard to me, and when I was prepared to rea&s;&s;ume my daily charge, they told me that George would take it in future, as the &s;tranger meant to have me with him. I would be u&s;ele&s;s were I to tell you what was my affliction at the thought of quitting this dear cottage, though not mine, and parting from my Loui&s;a, whom I loved even then, though &s;he was quite a child. My &s;ituation was not any way a happy one; and yet I could not quit it without &s;hedding tears. I could not po&s;&s;ibly fore&s;ee that my future de&s;tination was to be decided by the pre&s;ent moment. Yes, to thee benefi|cent
<PB N="89" REF="93">protector of my youth, I am a debtor for my pre&s;ent happine&s;s! Thou knowe&s;t, generous man, how ardently I prayed to God for thy pro&s;perity while thou wert living, and with what exhau&s;tle&s;s gratitude I ble&s;s even &s;till thy a&s;hes! He was called <HI>Lafont,</HI> and had the place of organi&s;t in no great pari&s;h. You would judge imperfectly of his abilities, if you adverted to the nature and ob&s;curity of his employment. Many tra|vellers turned out of their road to hear his mu&s;ic; but their prai&s;es only made him the more mode&s;t. I much doubt, if in the cour&s;e of your acquaintance, you have ever met with &s;uch a genius. He received from the affection of his father, who, when living, was a very great phy&s;ician, &s;uch an education as would certainly have made <HI>him</HI> eminent as a phy&s;ician likewi&s;e; but he rather cho&s;e to yield him&s;elf entirely to the ardent pa&s;&s;ion that he had long before conceived for mu&s;ic. He had married the daughter of the organi&s;t, whom he &s;ucceed|ed, but was childle&s;s. His dear wife, whom he had lo&s;t for &s;everal years, &s;till lived within his heart. Her image, and his books, were now his only &s;ociety in that deep melancholy which had &s;eized upon his mind; but &s;till while he avoided men, he did not hate them. On the contrary, he did much good in &s;ecret. He was forty years of age when I came to him. He in|&s;tructed me at fir&s;t to read and write, and afterwards took plea&s;ure in the cultivation of my voice, and teach|ing me to play the lute, which was his favourite in|&s;trument. He did not &s;top at mu&s;ical in&s;truction, he provided me &s;elections from the works of our greate&s;t poets. He formed at once my heart, my under&s;tand|ing, and my ta&s;te. Thus he acted, for five years, the part of an a&s;&s;iduous ma&s;ter, without any expectation of reward for all his pains and labour, but from him, who be&s;t knows how to recompence the &s;ervices that we do to our fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of all the&s;e occupations, I had never ba|ni&s;hed from my mind the recollection of my cottage, or the countenance of Loui&s;a, the partner of my childi&s;h pa&s;times. I was often &s;peaking of them to my patron, and accordingly one day&mdash;I never &s;hall forget it, the fir&s;t of June, four years ago&mdash;he ro&s;e betimes, and going, as his cu&s;tom was, to take a morning's walk, bade me fol|low
<PB N="90" REF="94">him. We talked of many matters while we went along, as chance pre&s;ented &s;ubjects for our conver&s;ation; till at la&s;t he brought me to the very mountain where I &s;aw him at fir&s;t. Dear Valentine, &s;aid he, I have ful|filled the duty which Providence, I thought, impo&s;ed upon me, when fir&s;t I &s;aw you. I am &s;en&s;ible how much you &s;igh when you reflect upon the habitation whence I took you; and have had no other view in undertaking to protect and educate you, than at la&s;t to put you in a way of getting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it once again. I now &s;hew it you; look at it: but take notice, I forbid, on pain of my di&s;|plea&s;ure, your returning thither, till &s;uch time as you have wherewithal to purcha&s;e it. I give you my own lute: I have in&s;tructed you to play upon it. Travel: you are not without a charming voice. Wherever you are heard, having no other preten&s;ions than to the name of an itinerant mu&s;ician, you will be the fir&s;t of arti&s;ts in your way. The novelty of the thing will never fail to bring you auditors and money: only be di&s;creet and fru|gal; and when rich enough, return into your own coun|try, and buy out your father's cottage.</P>
<P>My heart beat high at this di&s;cour&s;e, and grew enlarged with hope and joy. He held me to his bo&s;om, &s;hedding tears. They were the fir&s;t that I ever yet had &s;een fall from him, and they made a &s;ingular impre&s;&s;ion on me. After this, we thought of coming back, and he conducted me in &s;ilence to his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Upon the morrow, at the break of day, I was to leave my benefactor: he be&s;towed on me, at parting, the in|&s;truction which he imagined I mo&s;t needed, together with two louis d'ors. In four years time I travelled on foot through Italy, all France, and Germany, equipped like what I was, a pea&s;ant of the mountains, with my hair as you may &s;ee at pre&s;ent, floating in large curls upon my &s;houlders. I took notice that the &s;ingularity of &s;uch a dre&s;s increa&s;ed the effect proceeding from my mu&s;ic, and particularly in the capitals. Few noblemen. I &s;uppo&s;e, ever travelled more agreeably than I did. Every where I found a good reception, and not only from the middling &s;ort of people, but the mo&s;t polite. The quality in cities made up concerts, for no other purpo&s;e than to hear me; and in villages, I verily believe, they married for the mirth of dancing to the mu&s;ic of my in&s;trument. In many
<PB N="91" REF="95">places I had advantageous offers made me to take up my re&s;idence among them. They &s;educed me &s;ometimes, I acknowledge, for an in&s;tant; but as &s;oon as I reflected again on my cottage, every thought of fortune vani&s;hed; nor of all my projects left one trace remaining. I re|member &s;till what &s;weet &s;en&s;ations &s;eized me every time when I went over a mountain in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;e of my travels, or even came in &s;ight thereof. I &s;ought this hamlet on it, and imagined for a moment that I could &s;ee my cottage. With my mind continually full of &s;uch an idea, I endea|voured to expre&s;s my notions, and the&s;e couplets were my compo&s;ition.</P>

Valentine &s;ung the&s;e couplets with &s;uch &s;weetne&s;s and expre&s;&s;ion, as revived in my mind the fabulous ideas of Apollo; and methought I heard that exiled deity on earth, and in the vales of The&s;&s;aly, pouring forth his wi&s;hes to return to Olympus. I de&s;ired to &s;peak, to cry out; but found my tongue without motion. Valentine could not but co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ive the meaning of my &s;ilence, and went on as follows:</P>
<P>I am now about to tell you by what means I came again into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this precious cottage.</P>
<P>Towards December la&s;t, when I had taken up my dwelling for a &s;ea&s;on at Turin, and had been twice from one extremity of Italy to the other, I examined the &s;tate of my pur&s;e, and conceived my&s;elf then rich enough to pay a vi&s;it to my native mountain. I immediately &s;et out, and after &s;everal forced journeys, came in ten days time to the city where my benefactor had re&s;ided. With what anxious expectation did I enter it! and as I went along, a&s;k every one that I met, what tidings he could give me of him? But, alas! I was not to enjoy the plea&s;ure of expre&s;&s;ing what I owed him; nor to behold him, happy in the con&s;equences of the friend&s;hip that he had &s;hewn me. He had been dead two months. I went to pour out my tears on his tomb, and made a vow to heaven that I would call my fir&s;t child by his name, if I ever &s;hould be &s;o happy as to prove a father. On the evening of that day I gained this hamlet. Every one. I found, &s;poke fa|vourably of me, without knowing at fir&s;t who I was. My lute, and the remembrance of our friend&s;hip, &s;oon obtained me Loui&s;a's affection. I received her from her father. I bought back, with his con&s;ent, the cottage, and the field belonging to it, for two hundred crowns, with which his elde&s;t &s;on procured a farm below us, in the village, and has been now &s;ome time &s;ettled in it. With re&s;pect to him&s;elf, he acquie&s;ced to pa&s;s the remnant of his days, with George his younge&s;t &s;on, in our cottage. It is from him that I learn the art of hu&s;bandry; for now that I am once more in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my little patrimony, the amount of my ambition is to be, as was my father, a good hu&s;|band, a kind parent, and a virtuous pea&s;ant. I have not, as you may &s;ee, forgot my lute, the precious in&s;tru|ment which made my fortune; but &s;till keep it at my &s;ide,
<PB N="93" REF="97">and often take it up for my own recreation, or to plea&s;e my family and neighbours.</P>
<P>He &s;topped &s;hort at this; but &s;till, I thought, I heard him &s;peaking. My attention, captivated by his narra|tive, was turned in&s;en&s;ibly upon his per&s;on, after he had fini&s;hed. His ingenuous animated countenance, the con|tra&s;t of his dre&s;s and conver&s;ation, his attachment to a ru&s;tic habitation, and the gratitude with which he che|ri&s;hed the remembrance of his benefactor; his uncommon fortune, travels, and profe&s;&s;ion; every thing, I thought, exhibited the youth, in &s;ome &s;ort, as a being of enchant|ment, and &s;uperior to the ordinary race of men. Loui&s;a fir&s;t rou&s;ed me from my contemplation, by her motion in the act of leaning forward to embrace him. I compli|mented them on their happine&s;s, and they returned my civility with the mo&s;t ingenuous expre&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip. We went into the cottage, where I was charmed to behold &s;uch an appearance of order and cleanline&s;s about me. After having made a plentiful, but light repa&s;t, upon &s;uch fruits as I was told the mountain yielded, George led me to a clo&s;et which was rather narrow, but the bed that filled it was both clean and whole&s;ome. Of this bed, the little fellow told me, he di&s;po&s;ed with plea&s;ure in my favour. It was not long before I fell into a &s;ound &s;leep, during which my thoughts were occupied upon the grand objects that I had been contemplating in the evening, and the agreeable &s;en&s;ations which had &s;o recently impre&s;&s;ed me. I did not, all the following day, once quit this happy family, when they were either bu&s;y at work or unem|ployed.</P>
<P>Valentine related to me many entertaining matters that occurred to him in travelling, and explained how he acquired that ea&s;ine&s;s of manners and politene&s;s of expre&s;|&s;ion that had charmed me at fir&s;t, and which afterwards, as I di&s;covered, notwith&s;tanding his great youth, conci|liated the re&s;pect and love of every aged individual through the hamlet. The acutene&s;s of his under&s;tanding, the un&s;tudied openne&s;s of Loui&s;a, the old man's blunt good &s;en&s;e, the re&s;tle&s;s curio&s;ity of George, made their con|ver&s;ation intere&s;ting, and diffu&s;ed an unde&s;cribable variety through every part thereof, which both charmed me, and connected them much clo&s;er to each other. I think, I
<PB N="94" REF="98">could have pa&s;&s;ed my life away quite happy with them. But why, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, why brood on &s;uch a contem|plation? I was to leave them that very night. I confe&s;s, I felt a pang of &s;adne&s;s to reflect upon our &s;eparation, and imagined, by their looks, that it would occa&s;ion them &s;ome &s;orrow likewi&s;e. If my fortune &s;hould in future permit me to di&s;po&s;e of the remainder of my life with more liberty, I then intended, and do &s;till, to make a yearly vi&s;it to this mountain, for the purpo&s;e of &s;eeing my friends again, and filling my whole heart with tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations of contentedne&s;s and peace which their &s;ociety and habitation cannot but in&s;pire.</P>

<P>URBAN pa&s;&s;ed, and very ju&s;tly, for an excellent boy. He was extremely gentle, always ready to oblige his little friends, and never once di&s;plea&s;ed his pa|rents or in&s;tructors.</P>
<P>He had one great fault, however; he would lo&s;e his books, with other matters, and pay no attention to his clothes, which were in common very dirty. In one word, he was a &s;loven.</P>
<P>He had often been admoni&s;hed of, and puni&s;hed for, his negligence. This puni&s;hment and admonition grieved him, both on his own account, and as he knew that his friends were &s;orry to proceed thus har&s;hly with him. He had many times re&s;olved upon amendment; but the habit was &s;o &s;trong, that, notwith&s;tanding every re&s;olution, he had always the &s;ame &s;lovenly appearance.</P>
<P>His papa &s;ome time ago had promi&s;ed him and his three brothers, on the fir&s;t fine day, to take them out upon the water.

They jumped round about him in the tran&s;port of their joy; and Mr. We&s;ton, on his &s;ide, was very happy to remark their &s;atisfaction: but what was his wonder, when he &s;aw Urban, to ob&s;erve the un&s;eem|line&s;s of his apparel.</P>
<P>Of his &s;tockings, one was, as they &s;ay, about his heels; the other negligently gartered, if at all; in &s;ome &s;ort made his leg look like a twi&s;ted column. Two great holes were in his breeches knees; his wai&s;tcoat was from top to bottom &s;tained with grea&s;e or ink; and there was wanting half a collar to his coat.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="103">The father &s;aw with &s;orrow, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to take him in &s;o &s;lovenly a &s;tate; as every one would have thought, with rea&s;on, that the father of &s;o &s;lovenly a child mu&s;t be as negligent him&s;elf, to &s;uffer &s;uch a fault. And &s;eeing that Mr. We&s;ton was a man of merit, and e&s;teemed by tho&s;e who knew him, he was far from wi&s;hing &s;uch addition to his character.</P>
<P>Urban had another coat, but that unhappily was at the taylor's to be repaired; and it was not a trifle that would repair it, as it wanted one whole &s;kirt, which had been torn quite off. The &s;cowerer was to have it after|wards, and work a day, at lea&s;t, in getting out the dirt and &s;pots.</P>
<P>What was the con&s;equence then, my dear little friends? There is not one of you but may ea&s;ily gue&s;s.</P>
<P>His brothers, who had proper clothes to put on, and who&s;e general appearance did their father credit, were admitted into the boat. The body of it was painted blue, as were the oars. The gunnel and the edges of the oars were of a deep vermillion. In the boat there was a linen awning, that is roof, &s;upported at the corners, to pre|&s;erve the company beneath it from the &s;un: the water|men had nice white linen &s;hirts on; three mu&s;icians had their &s;tation in the &s;tern; they were provided with a haut|boy, clarionet and violin, and began to play a march in concert when the watermen fir&s;t dipped their oars into the water, upon which a crowd who were a&s;&s;embled at the &s;tairs replied thereto with joyous &s;houtings.</P>
<P>Poor Urban, who had plea&s;ed him&s;elf a long time with the thoughts of &s;uch an airing, was obliged to &s;tay at home. It is true, he had the plea&s;ure from a window of ob&s;erving his papa and brothers go into the boat, and of following it as far upon the river as his eye would let him, while a gentle breeze &s;welled out the &s;ails, and made it &s;eem to &s;kim along upon the &s;urface of the water: and it is true, his brothers, after their return, related all the plea&s;ures that they had ta&s;ted in their day's excur&s;ion; and of which the recollection made them &s;till jump for joy.</P>
<P>Another day, as he was playing in a meadow, with a little friend of his, he chanced to lo&s;e a buckle; but in&s;tead of &s;eeking diligently for it, he begged his comrade for a little while to lend him his, becau&s;e, in walking to
<PB N="100" REF="104">and fro, the &s;traps, which he trod on now and then, had already more than once been like to trip him up.</P>
<P>His little friend con&s;ented; and Urban, being quite intent on &s;omething, and extremely anxious to renew his motion, fa&s;tened it &s;o negligently that in le&s;s than twenty minutes time he lo&s;t that al&s;o.</P>
<P>They were both exceedingly embarra&s;&s;ed when the time was come for their returning home. Night overtook them, and the gra&s;s was &s;o high that a lamb might ea&s;ily have hid him&s;elf entirely in it. How then could they find, at du&s;k, a thing &s;o little? They came home clum|petty clump, each leaning on the other, and quite &s;ad; particularly Urban, who, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing real &s;en&s;ibility, was grieved in having thus expo&s;ed his bo&s;om friend and play|mate to the anger of his parents.</P>
<P>On the morrow he appeared before the family, when they were a&s;&s;embled together, with a &s;ingle buckle for two &s;hoes. Sad &s;ight for Mr. We&s;ton! who perceived by that how much his exhortations were &s;till thrown away.</P>
<P>As oft as Monday came about, he was accu&s;tomed to &s;upply Urban and his brothers with a regular allowance, that they might not be without the means of &s;atisfying what are u&s;ually the wants of children, but particularly any impul&s;e to be generous. Urban's brothers had con|&s;tantly the plea&s;ure of receiving this allowance; while he, poor fellow, hardly ever had any of it, on account of &s;toppages for buttons, handkerchiefs, and other things that he lo&s;t.</P>
<P>A &s;ilver buckle co&s;ts &s;ome money; but this was not the whole. He had lo&s;t his companion's, and was therefore obliged to pay for that likewi&s;e. How was he to do it? His allowance would not have enabled him to clear this debt in three months time.</P>
<P>His father luckily had taught him, even in his earlie&s;t infancy, to u&s;e a pen; and, to employ the common phra&s;e, he wrote already an exceedingly fine hand.</P>
<P>This, therefore, was the only occupation by which he could earn a little money; and, to his prai&s;e I mu&s;t ac|knowledge, he con&s;ented with a deal of willingne&s;s to an arrangement made on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>His companion's father was an eminent attorney, and employed above a dozen clerks to copy papers for him. Mr. We&s;ton therefore offered him Urban's &s;ervices in this
<PB N="101" REF="105">way, 'till &s;uch time as he had earned enough to pay him for the buckle; and reque&s;ted that the attorney would con&s;ent to &s;uch a way of &s;ettling matters, as it was very probable Urban might be greatly benefited by it.</P>
<P>The attorney freely acquie&s;ced, and down Urban &s;at to work in copying law proceedings, which at be&s;t were very tedious, and in general &s;crawled over &s;o that he could hardly read them, whil&s;t his brothers went a walking in the fields, or entertained them&s;elves by playing with each other in the garden.</P>
<P>Oh, how many &s;ighs did his inattention co&s;t him! and how much plea&s;ure did it occa&s;ion him to lo&s;e in a very few days!</P>
<P>He had time for making many &s;alutary comments on his conduct; and re&s;olving, for the time to come, upon a change. In &s;hort, he kept his re&s;olution; &s;o that were I now to point him out, dear little friends, to any of you, &mdash;when you noticed the cleanline&s;s of his per&s;on, and the neatne&s;s of his general appearance, you would find it dif|ficult to think that he could be the &s;ame little boy who&s;e hi&s;tory I have ju&s;t now written for your in&s;truction as well as amu&s;ement.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>To confe&s;s the truth, I have; and think you hardly the &s;ame per&s;on that you were formerly. What can have cau&s;ed &s;o great an alteration? Till you quitted England, ay, and unce you came from France, I mu&s;t acknowledge you were proud and huffi&s;h. You offended every body without &s;cruple, and the lea&s;t familiarity from others was con&s;idered as an in&s;ult by you; but at pre&s;ent your behaviour is engaging. You have that complacency and affability which cannot but win people's hearts. I freely tell you, I my&s;elf even love you ten times more at pre&s;ent than I did. You took &s;uch airs upon you before
<PB N="103" REF="107">as di&s;gu&s;ted me. I was a hundred times di&s;po&s;ed to break off all connection with you; whereas now, I find a real plea&s;ure in your company and conver&s;ation. And what plea&s;es me &s;till more than all is, that you &s;eem your&s;elf much happier than before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Araminta.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;o I am, dear friend. I was an object to be pitied at the time that you mention. I occa&s;ioned all our family, and every one that wi&s;hed me well, a deal of trouble. Mi&s;s Le F&eacute;vre, in particular, was grieved to think of my behaviour, as &s;he loved me tenderly; and yet, while I was grieving her, I knew that &s;he faithfully fulfilled the promi&s;e which &s;he made to my dear mama, upon her dying-bed, of loving me with all the affection of a mother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every body mu&s;t confe&s;s, you could not po&s;&s;ibly have fallen into better hands; and the advantage of your trip to France would have been really con&s;iderable had it only been the means of introducing &s;uch a per&s;on to you, I am told, there are few families but would wi&s;h to have her for their children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Araminta.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are yet to know how much I owe her; therefore I de&s;ign to tell you. It is the &s;tory of a morn|ing that will live for ever in my recollection: it was the morning of the 4th of this very month, and as I knew be|fore, her birth-day. I was awake betimes. She mu&s;t be &s;till a&s;leep, &s;aid I; for then we did not lie together, no not even in the &s;ame apartment. I will &s;urpri&s;e her, if I can, before &s;he ri&s;es; &s;o I dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf as nicely as I could, then took the ba&s;ket which a charming little lady, you know who, <STAGE>(&s;he &s;queezes Emily by the hand)</STAGE> had given me as a pre&s;ent, and ran down into the garden to get flowers, that I might &s;catter them on Mi&s;s Le F&eacute;vre's bed, as is the cu&s;tom upon birth-days in her country. I &s;tole &s;ecretly along the hedge, and, unperceived by any one, had gathered three fre&s;h ro&s;es. I now looked about for honey&s;uckles, je&s;&s;amin, and myrtle: I bethought my|&s;elf that they grew below the arbour at the bottom of the garden. I was running thither; but in pa&s;&s;ing by the arbour I &s;aw Mi&s;s Le F&eacute;vre on her knees within it, and both hands before her face; I turned to &s;hun her, but it was all in vain; &s;he heard my &s;teps, on which &s;he rai&s;ed her head, perceived me, and called out that I &s;hould come that moment to her.</P>

Noting her re|ception of me, which was friendly and affectionate, I could not but ob&s;erve that &s;he had a countenance of &s;orrow.</P>
<P>With one hand &s;he in&s;tantly took hold of mine, and pa&s;&s;ed the other round my middle. We walked up and down the terrace twice in this po&s;ition, and were &s;ilent; for, as Mademoi&s;elle forbore to &s;ay a word, I dur&s;t not move my lips, &s;o much was I affected by it!</P>
<P>But at length &s;he pre&s;&s;ed me &s;till more clo&s;ely to her bo&s;om, and beholding me with tenderne&s;s, and likewi&s;e glan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing at my ba&s;ket with the ro&s;es in it, I ob&s;erve, &s;aid &s;he, dear Araminta, you have lo&s;t no time to think upon my birth-day. This affectionate attention to me would certainly make me forget the melancholy thoughts which oppre&s;s my mind upon your account, but that your hap|pine&s;s occa&s;ioned them. Yes, deare&s;t Araminta, attribute only to my friend&s;hip what I am now about to mention. I am anxious to di&s;charge my bo&s;om of its load, that I may welcome afterward tho&s;e more delightful thoughts which I owe you for the pre&s;ent, that, I ob&s;erve, you were preparing for me.</P>
<P>I was dumb, and in a tremble, while &s;he thus addre&s;&s;ed me: it was as if my con&s;cience had addre&s;&s;ed me by her lips.</P>
<P>You, Araminta, continued &s;he, who have received from nature &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition, and have had that di&s;po&s;ition &s;o well cultivated by the example and in&s;tructions of your good mama, will you pervert it by a fault which of it&s;elf alone mu&s;t put out every virtue? I will not mention it by name; and now particularly, after what I have already told you. It might make you perhaps look with too much horror on your&s;elf; and I have no de&s;ire to mortify my lovely child. It is &s;ufficient that your heart acknow|ledges this fault: and I per&s;uade my&s;elf, I know you well enough to be a&s;&s;ured that your utmo&s;t efforts will, in &s;u|ture, be excited to de&s;troy it.</P>
<P>Let us not go too fat back; but only think of your behaviour ye&s;terday.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="113">Do you remember the deci&s;ive tone of voice with which you &s;poke when at breakfa&s;t, to di&s;play how much you knew of hi&s;tory? You cited, I mu&s;t own, events &s;uffi|ciently in&s;tructive to have made the company attend to what you &s;aid, but that they &s;aw you re&s;olved, if I may &s;ay &s;o, to excite their admiration. You appeared &s;o mar|vellou&s;ly well contented with your&s;elf, that they were really afraid of prai&s;ing you, which would have unavoid|ably inflamed or aggravated your &s;elf-love. Remember likewi&s;e, with how much attention they gave ear to little Arabella, and were really enchanted with the grace of her recital, and the mode&s;ty with which &s;he blu&s;hed at being thought &s;o well informed. I &s;aw you, my dear, turn pale with &s;pite and envy. Tears of rage were in your eyes, and it was in vain that you &s;trove to hide them, while the company were inwardly rejoiced to &s;ee you &s;o compleatly humbled.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, when with an air of triumph in your eyes you came to &s;hew your writing, and it pa&s;&s;ed with|out receiving any of tho&s;e prai&s;es that you expected&mdash; with what vi&s;ible vexation did you receive it back when every one had &s;een it!</P>
<P>And at night, when you accompanied Mi&s;s Arabella on the harp&s;ichord, the bad time that you kept, perhaps on purpo&s;e, put her out; and when &s;he a&s;ked you in a whi&s;per to play better, what a hideous look did you then put on, in&s;tead of doing as &s;he bade you?</P>
<P>Ah! for heaven's &s;ake, interrupted I, and at the &s;ame time bur&s;t out a crying: Do not go on, for you mu&s;t know, Emily, her di&s;cour&s;e had pierced me to the heart.</P>
<P>It was vanity, &s;aid I to Mademoi&s;elle: that vice which you dur&s;t not mention by its name. I never &s;aw its fright|fulne&s;s &s;o much, believe me, as at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>I could &s;ay no more; but &s;he was able to di&s;cern my thoughts. Her arm in agitation pre&s;&s;ed me once more to her bo&s;om with a tenderne&s;s that I am unable to de&s;cribe. I felt her tears fall plenteou&s;ly upon my cheeks, while with her eyes &s;he looked in &s;ilence up to heaven.</P>
<P>The cloquence of this mute prayer compleatly over|whelmed me. We were come, without perceiving it, to the foot of this large tree. We &s;topped clo&s;e by this green bank, and I fell down upon it half &s;wooning as it
<PB N="106" REF="114">were. She in&s;tantly afforded me the tendere&s;t &s;uccour, and re&s;tored me to new life by her affectionate care&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Being ju&s;t upon the point of going in, I &s;aid, renewing my embraces, dry your tears up, my good friend; they are the la&s;t that you &s;hall have cau&s;e to &s;hed on my account.</P>
<P>On her part, &s;he embraced me &s;till more tenderly, and an&s;wered, &s;aying, You could never have rejoiced me &s;o compleatly on my birth-day as by this noble re&s;olution. It is the fitte&s;t no&s;egay for us both, the no&s;egay that I hope will never lo&s;e its beauty.</P>
<P>By degrees we both became more tranquil. She re|marked the finene&s;s of the morning; and my heart, now ea&s;ed of an intolerable load, was in a proper di&s;po&s;ition to enjoy the beauty of the day which came on very fine.</P>
<P>I grew &s;en&s;ible how &s;weet it is to have the experience of this calm within one's &s;elf. I begged her to in&s;truct me by what means I might keep up &s;o plea&s;ing a &s;erenity. Two hours thus pa&s;&s;ed away between us in a conver&s;ation full of friend&s;hip and affectionate in&s;truction.</P>
<P>My papa, without informing me of his intention, had prepared a little banquet; we were pre&s;ent at it, and gave &s;igns with how much joy our bo&s;oms overflowed. Since then, dear friend, I have begun to put away that odious vice which made me in&s;upportable to others and my&s;elf. I leave you then to think, if I can po&s;&s;ibly omit, on the return of &s;uch a day, to te&s;tify my gratitude for &s;uch a worthy friend, who was the means of making it the are of my happine&s;s.</P>

<P>What is his behaviour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The A&s;&s;i&s;tant.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, &s;ir, he is very &s;tudious when in &s;chool, and nothing can divert him from the bu&s;ine&s;s of it: but in play-time he is &s;ilent and re&s;erved among the &s;cholars. I have given him two, who are al|lowed to be the &s;prightlie&s;t, as companions, and enjoined them to do every thing in their power to plea&s;e him. He is &s;en&s;ible indeed to their endeavours, and acknowledges their kindne&s;s; but when all is done, their fire is utterly incapable of warming him, and he appears between them ju&s;t like &s;o much ice. <HI>Yes,</HI> gentlemen; <HI>no,</HI> gentlemen; and &s;uch like mono&s;yllables, are all his an&s;wers to their que&s;tions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Ma&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is &s;ad, no doubt, at being &s;eparated from his parents?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The A&s;&s;i&s;tant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, it is very natural to think &s;o; yet his &s;adne&s;s has continued now ten days; and can we think a child of only twelve years of age really &s;u&s;ceptible of an impre&s;&s;ion for that length of time?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Ma&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not often: but a child of &s;o much eleva|tion as I thought his countenance indicated!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The A&s;&s;i&s;tant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon, &s;ir, my contradicting you; for if that age is very lively, it is variable al&s;o, and &s;ince I have been a tutor here, I have noticed that all tho&s;e who have been mo&s;t afflicted at the thought of being &s;eparated from their parents, have, and very &s;hortly, been induced by their companions to forget that &s;eparation. Now whatever Edward's notions may be on this head, what will you think when I have told you every thing?</P>

<SPEAKER>The Ma&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>You rai&s;e my curio&s;ity. Proceed. I look to be informed of nothing on the &s;ubject of this Edward but what is great and &s;ingular!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The A&s;&s;i&s;tant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would you believe it then, &s;ir, he re|fu&s;es every thing at meal time, but a little bread and water. It is not po&s;&s;ible that any criminal &s;hould be condemned to coar&s;er fare than what he voluntarily chu&s;es!</P>
</SP>

<P>You do not tell me &s;o? He &s;hould have lived at Sparta.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The A&s;&s;i&s;tant.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, &s;ir; but with us, where &s;ingula|rity mu&s;t not be &s;uffered, and the little &s;oldier is to be &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to general &s;ubordination, there is room to fear &s;ome danger to the re&s;t in his example. Twenty times would I have made him eat the victuals &s;et before him; but to all my in&s;tances, he has no otherwi&s;e made an&s;wer, than by turning towards me, and in tears,&mdash;I weep my&s;elf to think of his affecting way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Ma&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I too am not unmoved. This di&s;obedience is, however, blameable, and mu&s;t not be unpuni&s;hed. If he &s;hould per&s;i&s;t therein, whatever cau&s;es it, he cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;tay here. The intention of a military &s;chool is nothing le&s;s than that the &s;cholars &s;hould be ab&s;olutely &s;ubject to the will of their in&s;tructors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The A&s;&s;i&s;tant.</SPEAKER>
<P>His di&s;mi&s;&s;ion was indeed the circum|&s;tance that I feared; and therefore did I put off &s;peaking of his di&s;obedience to you. I was every day in hope that his re&s;olution would be conquered; but it &s;till con|tinues.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Ma&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible, that at his tender age he &s;hould be &s;o far ma&s;ter of him&s;elf, as to conceal his thoughts from one &s;o exerci&s;ed as you are in examining the di&s;po&s;itions of young people?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The A&s;&s;i&s;tant.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is what you called him ju&s;t now, a true Spartan. His behaviour, though not tinctured with a grain of pride, is perfectly &s;educing. Such is, I may &s;ay, his manner of concealing what afflicts him, that one cannot but be really a&s;toni&s;hed at his &s;ilence, and yet not har&s;h enough to think him ob&s;tinate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Ma&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will &s;ound him then my&s;elf. The light in which you place his portrait, adds con&s;iderably to the fair opinion that I formed on my fir&s;t &s;eeing him. If I can po&s;&s;ibly prevail upon him to reveal the cau&s;e of his
<PB N="110" REF="118">affliction, I per&s;uade my&s;elf, I &s;hall be fully compen&s;ated for my trouble in obtaining it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The A&s;&s;i&s;tant.</SPEAKER>
<P>On my part, threats, entreaties, and per&s;ua&s;ion, have been all employed without effect. Of cour&s;e then, I mu&s;t fear, your efforts will be no le&s;s un|&s;ucce&s;sful, though I wi&s;h the contrary, and &s;hould be even happy if it proved &s;o.</P>

<P>He thinks more, I verity believe, of Edward, than him&s;elf. I have ob&s;erved him &s;tudying his actions &s;ilently.&mdash;Then he has never uttered a &s;yllable to you about him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Ma&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>No: but I am as well plea&s;ed with his re&s;erve as his attention. It proclaims a &s;ecret &s;ympathy between him and the youth who has attracted him. You will oblige me by conducting them all three together here this in&s;tant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The A&s;&s;i&s;tant.</SPEAKER>

<P>Right: &s;o let them come alone; and &s;end me Edward likewi&s;e, when you find that they have le&s;t me; or, on &s;econd thoughts, let him &s;it down and wait my coming in the parlour. I will be with him &s;hortly.</P>

<P>This affair is all a my&s;tery to me! It is very natural that Edward &s;hould grieve at being &s;eparated from his parents. It is not po&s;&s;ible but that a boy of &s;uch great hopes &s;hould be extremely dear to every one who knows him, and have had continual marks of their indulgence; but that nothing &s;hould have mitigated his affliction in the period of ten days, &s;urrounded by &s;o many of his age, and all no doubt de&s;irous to amu&s;e him; and &s;till more, that he &s;hould wi&s;h for nothing in the world but bread
<PB N="111" REF="119">and water, is inexplicable! What the children have to eat is very good, and therefore could not from its quality di&s;gu&s;t him. Be&s;ides, he was never u&s;ed at home to better fare. His father, at his bringing him to &s;chool, in|formed me he was far from rich, and had a numerous family to maintain.

I think that I hear ince&s;&s;antly the pari&s;h bells a tolling, for the burial of my father, mother, brothers, and poor &s;i&s;ters.

<P>OH! I'll be revenged, and make him heartily repent it, cried little Philip, while his countenance turned quite red with anger, and he walked along, not &s;eeing Emilius, his dear friend, who, at that in&s;tant, hap|pened to be coming towards him, and hearing what he &s;aid with &s;ome degree of pain, a&s;ked him, of whom he meant to be revenged? Philip lifted up his eyes; he &s;aw his friend, and rea&s;&s;umed the &s;mile with which his countenance was generally glowing. Ah! &s;aid he, come, my friend, and you &s;hall &s;ee of whom I will be revenged. You remember, I believe, my little <HI>&s;upple Jack,</HI> that pretty cane my father gave me: &s;ee, it is all in pieces; the farmer's &s;on, that lives at yonder thatched cottage, has broke it. And pray why did he break it? &s;aid Emilius. I was walking peaceably along, &s;aid Philip, with the greate&s;t agitation, and was playing with my cane, by putting it quite round my body; one of the two ends, by &s;ome means or another, got out of my hand when I was oppo&s;ite the gate ju&s;t by the wooden bridge, and where the little blackguard had put down a pitcher full of water, which he was carry|ing home from the well. My cane, in &s;pringing, &s;truck the pitcher, over&s;et but did not break it. He came up clo&s;e to me, and began to call me names. I &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;&s;ured him that I had not intended to do what I did, and was extremely &s;orry for the accident. He would not hear me, but got hold that moment of my <HI>&s;upple Jack,</HI> and twi&s;ted it as you may &s;ee. I will make him, however, heartily repent it; I &s;hall &s;ind a way to be revenged of him.</P>
<P>He is, indeed, a very ill-natured boy, &s;aid Emilius, but is already puni&s;hed very well for being &s;o, &s;ince every one dete&s;ts and &s;huns him. If he wi&s;hes to enjoy a little play, he never can have a companion: if he comes where any boys are met to play, they always thru&s;t him out; but if he will not quit them, they leave him.

<P>Yes; but he has broke my cane, &s;aid Philip. My papa gave it me but very lately; and it was a very pretty one as you know.

I did him no harm. I offered to fill up his pitcher, having knocked it down without de&s;ign.&mdash;The ill-natured our! I will be revenged of him.</P>
<P>Believe me, my dear friend, &s;aid Emilius, it will be better not to mind him. Your contempt is puni&s;hment enough for &s;uch a one. You are not like him; and, depend up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n it, he will &s;hew him&s;elf at all times abler to do mi&s;chief th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n your&s;elf. And now I think upon it, I mu&s;t tell you what but very lately happened to him.</P>
<P>Unluckily for him, he &s;aw a bee upon a flower: he tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d to catch it, and pull off its wings for pa&s;time<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; but the bee contrived to &s;ting him, and flew off in &s;afety to the hive. Quite mad with rage, he &s;aid, as you did, I will be revenged for this! Accordingly he cut him&s;elf a &s;witch, thru&s;t it through the hole into the bee-hive, and turned it about. By the&s;e means he killed &s;everal of the little creatures; but in an in&s;tant the whole &s;warm flew all at once upon, and &s;tung him in a thou&s;and different places. You may gue&s;s how he roar|ed with the pain, and how in his agony be tumbled him&s;elf about upon the ground. His father ran up to him, and could not, without much difficulty, put the bees to flight, by flinging bowls of water on him. He was ill, in con&s;equence of this, for &s;everal days.</P>
<P>You &s;ee then, his vengeance had no very great &s;uc|ce&s;s. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> not therefore his in&s;ults: he will meet with &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> who will pani&s;h him, without your taking any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in the matter. And be&s;ides, as he is ill|natured, would you be &s;o likewi&s;e; for, my friend, he is much &s;tronger than you are, and, to be &s;ure of your re|venge, you mu&s;t be much more malicious than he is.</P>
<P>I think, &s;aid Philip, you are in the right: &s;o come along with me. I will tell my father every thing, and he will not be angry with me, I hope; for look you, I can ea&s;ily take comfort for my broken cane, but not &s;hould he imagine that I neglected to take care of what he
<PB N="125" REF="137">gave me. After this, they went together. Philip told his father what had happened. The good gentleman con&s;oled his &s;on, and thanked little Emilius for the advice that he had given him.</P>
<P>On the day &s;ucceeding, Philip had another cane, ex|actly like the fir&s;t. He pa&s;&s;ed the farmer's hou&s;e: his &s;on was at the door, and hung his head, while Philip went along.</P>
<P>However Philip, &s;ome days after, &s;aw this little pea|&s;ant fall under a heavy log of wood that he was carrying home, and which prevented him from getting up again. Philip ran up to him, took the log from off his &s;houlder. helped him to ri&s;e, and take his load once more upon his &s;houlders. The ill-natured boy was now quite over|whelmed with &s;hame at the idea of receiving aid from him whom he had &s;erved &s;o ill, and heartily repented his behaviour. Philip afterwards went home quite &s;a|tisfied. At fir&s;t, he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted one whom he did not love, becau&s;e he could not &s;ee a fellow-creature &s;uffer without relleving him; but afterwards he was rejoiced to think of his behaviour. "This (&s;aid Philip) is the noble&s;t vengeance. It is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould repent thereof."</P>

<HEAD>CHARLOTTE.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE the hou&s;e in which Charlotte's parents li|ved, you mu&s;t know, there was a little opening, ornamented with a gra&s;s plat, and quite over&s;haded with a noble tree, from whence the eye could plainly &s;ee whatever pa&s;&s;ed along the public road. Mi&s;s Charlotte frequently would come beneath this umbrage with her little chair, and in her hand the &s;tocking that &s;he was making for her dear mama, who had in&s;tructed her to knit. One day, as &s;he was &s;itting there, &s;he &s;aw a poor old man advancing very &s;lowly towards her, on the road: his hair was of a &s;ilver white, his back was b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt with age, he re&s;ted on a &s;tick and &s;eemed to walk in pain. Poor man! &s;aid Charlottle, looking at him, he
<PB N="126" REF="138">&s;eems very much in pain, and perhaps is poor be&s;ides. If &s;o then, he is doubly mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>Further on, &s;he &s;aw a company of boys together, who came after the old man. They very quickly reached him. They remarked his thread-bare coat, which was exceed|ingly long &s;kirted, and had &s;leeves a deal too &s;hort. His hat, quite ru&s;ty, did not e&s;cape their notice, as the flaps hung down upon his &s;houlders; he had hollow cheeks; and &s;eeing him they all bur&s;t out a laughing. As it chan|ced, there lay a &s;tone upon the ground before him, which he &s;tumbled over, and was almo&s;t down: this &s;et them once again a laughing, while the poor old man, for his part, &s;ighed.</P>
<P>I once was young as you are, &s;aid he to the boys, and did not laugh at the infirmities of &s;uch as I am now. You will in time be old your&s;elves; and every day you are approaching towards my time of life. You will then be &s;en&s;ible of the inju&s;tice of your ridicule. So &s;ay|ing, he went on again, but made a &s;econd &s;tumble, and in &s;truggling to pre&s;erve him&s;elf from falling, drop|ped his lick. At this, the boys renewed their laugh a third time, crying, let us &s;ee now, how he will lift it up again?</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Charlotte, who had heard the old man &s;peak, and was touched with pity for him, &s;aw his &s;ituation, put her &s;tocking down upon the chair, ran towards him, took up his &s;tick, put it back into his hand, and taking hold of his other arm, as if &s;he had been very &s;trong, exhorted him to lean upon her, and not notice any thing that the boys might &s;ay. The poor old man looked at her. "Lovely child," &s;aid he, "how good you are! I am at once con&s;oled for all the ridicule with which they treat me. May you be for ever happy!" and &s;o &s;aying, they walked on together; but the boys no longer followed him as they had done before: perhaps they were a&s;hamed of their proceeding.</P>
<P>Some few moments after, one of them fell down him|&s;elf, and all the re&s;t bur&s;t out a laughing as they had done before; for his part, he was very angry, and when up again, ran after his companions, pelting them with &s;tones. He was convinced then how unju&s;t it is to laugh at any one's di&s;tre&s;s: he formed a re&s;olution never, for the time to come, to laugh at any old man's pain, and fol|lowed
<PB N="127" REF="139">at a di&s;tance him whom he had before made the object of laughter, hoping to have the opportunity of making &s;ome atonement for his fault.</P>
<P>In the mean time the good old man, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the friendly aid of Charlotte, went on with flow, but yet &s;ure &s;teps. She offered him the opportunity of &s;topping to repo&s;e him&s;elf a little. Do you &s;ee our hou&s;e, &s;aid &s;he? Pray &s;tay and &s;it a little under that large tree: my parents are neither of them at home; you will on that account be not &s;o well entertained; yet &s;till, you will enjoy a little re&s;t. The poor old man accepted Charlotte's offer. Charlotte brought him out a chair; and then, to hearten up his &s;pirits, let him have &s;ome good &s;mall beer and bread and chee&s;e. The child had nothing el&s;e to give.</P>
<P>Her gue&s;t could not refrain from thanking her conti|nually. "Your parents are &s;till alive?" &s;aid he. "They love you; you love them? They cannot therefore but be very happy: may they always be &s;o!"&mdash;"And you, good old man," &s;aid Charlotte, "have you no children?"&mdash; "I had once a &s;on," &s;aid he, "who was &s;ettled in London: he loved me affectionately, and often came to &s;ee me; but alas! he is now dead, and I am left without the lea&s;t degree of con&s;olation. Indeed, his widow is rich: &s;he takes the lady on her, and imagines it not worth her while to know if I am dead or living, as &s;he wi&s;hes to forget that her hu&s;band's father is a pea&s;ant. I do not even know her children, which in truth are mine."&mdash;He was &s;o much affected while he &s;poke the&s;e words, that tears rolled down his withered cheeks.</P>
<P>The gentle Charlotte likewi&s;e was affected, and cried out, Can any one be &s;o cruel! Ah! my mother, my dear mother, would not act &s;o wickedly. On this, &s;he &s;poke of other matters, that &s;he might not grieve him; when he aro&s;e, and thanked Charlotte with a ble&s;&s;ing: but &s;he would not leave him &s;o; &s;he meant to go a little way &s;till farther with him.</P>
<P>On the way, they &s;aw the little boy who had been fol|lowing them; for he had run a great way on before, and now was &s;itting on the gra&s;s. He ca&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is eyes down when they looked upon him; ro&s;e up after they had pa&s;&s;ed, and followed them again. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e girl ob&s;erved him, but would not &s;peak of him. She a&s;ked the old man, if he lived alone. No, little lady, an&s;wered he, I have a cot|tage:
<PB N="128" REF="140">&s;ee, there it is, be&s;ide you tree acro&s;s the meadow. You ob&s;erve, it is no great di&s;tance off: it is in the middle of a little garden. I have an orchard, and a field like|wi&s;e; and I told a poor old neighbour, who &s;ome years &s;ince left his cottage, which fell down through age, that if he would but come and live with me, he &s;hould in fu|ture cultivate my ground. I told him, that I would live with him, that he &s;hould enjoy whatever I might have, and I would only a&s;k him to provide me nece&s;&s;aries. He agreed. He never had a child: he is extremely good and hone&s;t; and, for my part, I am quite at ea&s;e in his &s;o|ciety. And yet, in &s;pite of all his diligence, at times I think my&s;elf de&s;erted. I no longer &s;ee my &s;on, and I was con&s;tantly accu&s;tomed to receive from him the tendere&s;t tokens of affection. In the very place where I have &s;een him run to meet me, I am now a&s;&s;i&s;ted only by the hand of &s;trangers. I no longer &s;ee his children, who have utterly forgot me: I &s;hall live far di&s;tant from them: I &s;hall die, and very likely never &s;ee them more.&mdash;Alas! if their poor father were but &s;till living!&mdash;He could not utter one word more.</P>
<P>The gentle Charlotte, touched with the&s;e complaints, &s;aid to him, I will come and &s;ee you with my mother: we will frequently be with you. But her kindne&s;s only &s;erved to aggravate his grief. The &s;en&s;ibility and kind|ne&s;s of the little girl made him recollect of how much con&s;c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation he was utterly deprived; and in returning her his thanks, the tears, which he could not help &s;hedding, hindered him from &s;eeing where he walked.</P>
<P>He took his handkerchief to wipe his eyes, and, trou|bled by &s;ad thoughts, in&s;tead of putting it again into his pocket, let it drop upon the ground, without perceiving what he did; nor did his young companion notice it. The boy however, who was following them, ob&s;erved the whole tran&s;action, picked it up, and ran to give it him. "Here, good old man," &s;aid he, "you dropped your han<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">kerchief: it was on the ground."</P>
<P>Thank you, thank you heartily, my little friend, an|&s;wered the old man. God's providence be prai&s;ed for all things! Here is an hone&s;t little gentleman, who does not ricicule old age, and laugh at the afflictions that attend it. Oh! no, no; you do not look with &s;corn upon a poor old man. I &s;ee it in your eyes. You are not of the num|ber
<PB N="129" REF="141">of tho&s;e wicked little fellows whom you mu&s;t certainly have pa&s;&s;ed, although you were not with them. Char|lotte recollected having &s;een the little boy among them, and remarked his laughing ju&s;t as they did, but &s;he would not &s;ay a word about it; for although &s;he did not at all approve the boy's behaviour, yet her good nature would not &s;uffer her to give him pain, by telling what &s;he knew.</P>
<P>The little culprit, in the mean time, held down his head, and thought of lying more than once; but he had not been u&s;ed to &s;uch a crime. His heart, be&s;ides, was not &s;o wicked that he needed to conceal the truth, le&s;t people &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e him. "Pardon me," &s;aid he; "I was among them, and in&s;ulted you as they did; but am now very &s;orry for it. I have found out, &s;ome time pa&s;t, that when I mix with children of my age, or thereabouts, I am more mi&s;chievous than when alone. Had I been by my&s;elf, I &s;hould never have laughed at your &s;tumbling; but, on the contrary, my fir&s;t de&s;ire would certainly have been to help you. I &s;hould be very happy to a&s;&s;i&s;t you now, if I could, in order to make amends for my of|fence."</P>
<P>"You have already done &s;o, my good little friend," &s;aid he. You have a deal of candour and good-nature, and will certainly become an hone&s;t man. I dare believe as much. Come, therefore, both of you to my abode. It is ju&s;t before us; but a few &s;teps more, and we &s;hall be there. I will let you have &s;ome milk, and we will drink together."&mdash;At this invitation of the good old man, our little boy was very happy. Charlotte would have wi&s;hed to decline it, but did not, from a fear of grieving him. They reached the habitation: he brought out &s;ome milk, two porringers, and a loaf of bread a little coar&s;e, it mu&s;t be owned, but very good. They all &s;at down upon the gra&s;s, and made a comfortable meal. "What plea&s;ure you both give me," &s;aid the good old man. "Yes, truly, I am very much delighted upon this occa&s;ion. I have found out two good little friends, who neither &s;corn the poor man, nor the infirm. My <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eep at night will be the &s;weeter for it."</P>
<P>Both the boy and girl, as they &s;at be&s;ide him, te&s;tified their joy and gratitude; but yet their looks were more expre&s;&s;ive than their words. However, they began to
<PB N="130" REF="142">think of going. Charlotte feared le&s;t her parents might come home, and be unea&s;y at her ab&s;ence; and the little man expre&s;&s;ed how he was grieved &s;o &s;oon to quit him: but his mother, he feared, would &s;cold him, &s;hould he think of &s;taying longer.</P>
<P>"She mu&s;t then be very cro&s;s, this mother that you dread &s;o much," &s;aid the poor old man.&mdash;"Not always," &s;aid the little boy. "However, &s;he is &s;ometimes &s;o; and though &s;he loves me, yet I fear her greatly."&mdash;"And your father?"&mdash;"Oh! I &s;carce knew him: he has been dead the&s;e four years."&mdash;"Dead the&s;e four years!" interrupted the old man, and fixed his eyes upon the child. "Should it be he?&mdash;I have &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me recollection of his features!&mdash; Should it be little Francis?"&mdash;"Yes, Francis is my name."</P>
<P>The old man &s;tood for &s;ome few moments motionle&s;s, and with an altered voice, his eye brim full of tears, and with extended arms, cried out to Francis, "My dear child! you do not recollect your grandfather?&mdash;Embrace me!&mdash;You have the very features of my &s;on. My deare&s;t child, you no longer thought of me."&mdash;Francis tenderly care&s;&s;ed him, but endeavoured all in vain to &s;peak. Little Charlotte too &s;hed tears of joy, to &s;ee the old man com|forted.</P>
<P>"You &s;ee him," &s;aid the good man, "you &s;ee him!" He is in reality the living picture of his father. Yes, he is my &s;on!&mdash;My &s;on affectionately loved me, and his &s;on will love me too. I &s;hall not be &s;o wretched as I feared in my old age; nor will the evening of my life be pa&s;&s;ed without &s;ome joy. I &s;hall depart in peace. But I forget that by detaining you, I may &s;ubject you to your mother's anger: I was &s;o much plea&s;ed, that I forgot that circum|&s;tance. Depart then, my dear boy! I do not wi&s;h that my joy &s;hould co&s;t you tears. Depart, and love your mother; be obedient to her, even though you &s;hould not come and &s;ee me. It will be very hard, however, &s;hould you quit me now for ever. Come and &s;ee me, if you can, provided you do not di&s;obey, or tell a &s;tory, to obtain permi&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>Turning then to Charlotte: "And for you, dear little maid," &s;aid he, "I am convinced, you ought to leave me, as your parents would be certainly unea&s;y, &s;hould you &s;tay too long. I owe you all my joy, and &s;hall for ever
<PB N="131" REF="143">ble&s;s you. Come at times, and &s;ee me. Do not, I be|&s;eech you, my dear children, utterly forget me! May you both be happy!"</P>
<P>At the&s;e words the children went away, affectionately holding one another by the hand. They did not &s;peak, but every now and then they looked behind them; while the old man, on his &s;ide, continued looking con&s;tantly at them, and did not turn to go into his cottage until they were out of &s;ight. Little Charlotte got home &s;afe. Her parents were not yet returned; however, they came home very &s;oon after her. She told them where &s;he had been, and what &s;he had done. It was the &s;ubject of their even|ing's conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>On the morrow, they all went to &s;ee the good old man; and in the &s;equel, frequently repeated their kind vi&s;it. Francis likewi&s;e came to &s;ee his grandfather, who was re|joiced to &s;ee him, to hear him &s;peak, and to receive the mo&s;t affectionate care&s;&s;es from him; while, for his part, Francis was as much rejoiced, excepting when he did not &s;ee his Charlotte: he was then quite &s;orrowful, and went home &s;ad. The more he grew towards manhood, &s;till the more he loved her; and accordingly, when he was old enough to take a wife, he would e&s;pou&s;e no other woman, though &s;he was not rich. The old man lived to &s;ee them married, ble&s;&s;ed them, and &s;oon after died in peace.</P>

<HEAD>THE WATCH.</HEAD>
<P>YOUNG Clara, at her return from a vi&s;it which &s;he had ju&s;t before been paying to an intimate ac|quaintance, appeared quite pen&s;ive and &s;ad. She found her &s;i&s;ters entertaining one another with that innocent and lively joy which heaven &s;eems delighted to infu&s;e into the &s;ports of infancy. In&s;tead of making one among them with her u&s;ual playfulne&s;s, &s;he moved to a corner of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oom, &s;at there as if it vexed her to behold their gaiety, and when the little ones began to prattle, in hopes that &s;he would join in their diver&s;ion, replied peevi&s;hly to what they a&s;ked her. When the father, who loved Clara ex|ceedingly,
<PB N="132" REF="144">beheld her thus dejected, which was but very &s;eldom the ca&s;e, he began to be unea&s;y, put her on his knee, and taking her affectionately by the hand, enquired what ailed his little child, that &s;he appeared &s;o melan|choly? "Nothing, nothing," an&s;wered Clara at fir&s;t, to all his que&s;tions; but at length, on being pre&s;&s;ed more earne&s;tly to tell him every thing, &s;he replied, that all the little ladies whom &s;he had &s;een that evening at her friend's, where &s;he had been a vi&s;iting, had each received a very pretty pre&s;ent from their parents, or el&s;e friends, by way of fairing; though not one among them was &s;o far ad|vanced in learning as her&s;elf. She mentioned more par|ticularly one Mi&s;s Richmond, who&s;e uncle had, that very morning, purcha&s;ed her a very fine gold watch. "Oh! what plea&s;ure," added &s;he, "Mi&s;s Richmond mu&s;t feel, in having &s;uch a hand&s;ome watch be&s;ide her!"</P>
<P>"This then is the cau&s;e of your unea&s;ine&s;s, I find?" &s;aid Mr. Ford with a &s;mile. "Thank heaven, it is not &s;o bad as I imagined! I &s;uppo&s;ed that you might have met with &s;ome unhappy accident. And what would you do then, my dear &s;weet Clara, with a watch?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>What others do, papa. I would have it fa&s;tened to my girdle, and look at it every moment of the day, that I might know what time it was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ford.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! every moment, Clara? Your mo|ments then are very precious; or perhaps your hours of needle-work and &s;tudy hang too heavy on you?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, papa; for you have often told me that I am at pre&s;ent in the happie&s;t &s;ea&s;on of my life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, my child, if you have no occa|&s;ion for a watch, but to know the hour, we have a clock here, at the &s;tair-ca&s;e foot, and that will always tell you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, papa; but then I need not mention, that up &s;tairs I cannot always hear it &s;trike, and Bridget is very &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dom there, to come down for me, and &s;ee what o'clock it is. Now, when I want to know, if I de&s;cend my&s;elf, that takes up much time; whereas a watch at hand would let me know the time at once: nor &s;hould I then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eed trouble any one, or lo&s;e a moment of the day my&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ford.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, a watch mu&s;t be exceedingly con|venient, though it were but to inform one's writing-ma&s;ter

<P>Well then, Clara, if you de&s;ire more &s;erious conver&s;ation, tell me frankly, why you &s;o much wi&s;h to have a watch?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have, papa, already.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ford.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I wi&s;h to know your real motive. You are &s;en&s;ible, words alone never &s;atisfy me.&mdash;You are afraid, perhaps, to tell me. Well then, I <HI>will</HI> for you; and you will &s;ay your&s;elf, that I deal more frankly with you, than you with me. The rea&s;on why you want a watch is this: that when folks pa&s;s you, they may &s;ay, "Oh! &s;ee what a charming watch that little lady has! She mu&s;t be va&s;tly rich indeed!"&mdash;Now tell me, do not you think it very pitiful to boa&s;t of being richer than other people, and to di&s;play fine things about you for the multitude to admire? Do you fancy that any rea&s;onable per&s;on will e&s;teem a little lady more, becau&s;e her father has a great deal of money? You your&s;elf, do you e&s;teem tho&s;e more who may be richer than you are? When you behold a hand&s;ome watch, and are not in the lea&s;t acquainted with the wearer of it, far from &s;aying, "There is a worthy little lady with a pretty watch before her!" do not you rather &s;ay, "What a charming watch that little lady wears!"&mdash;It is plain, that if a watch does honour to any body, it is to the workman; but the wearer of it, if &s;he claims any merit from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a bauble, I &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e for her vanity.</P>

<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I grievou&s;ly &s;u&s;pect as much; but you will not allow it. Well then, I think, I &s;hall compel you very &s;oon to &s;uch a confe&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>Oh! do not tell me &s;o, papa! for you mu&s;t own, a watch is very u&s;eful, &s;ince you always have one&mdash; you that talk &s;o much again&s;t my vanity.</P>

<P>It is true; but then you know, I cannot do without one. What I have to do at home is often inter|rupted by my public avocations or employment; &s;o that I mu&s;t be exact and punctual in allowing each the nece&s;&s;ary time.</P>

<P>Ju&s;t the thing I expected! You perceive, the motive of utility which you in&s;i&s;ted on ju&s;t now with &s;uch importance, was merely a pretext to hide your va|nity; for this &s;ame watch would do you all the &s;ervice that you could po&s;&s;ibly derive from one enriched with dia|monds. Why take up your thoughts with what the world may &s;ay concerning you? However, in this ca&s;e they will
<PB N="135" REF="147">applaud your judgment, which could chu&s;e a watch for real &s;ervice, not for empty appearance.</P>

<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, papa, why hinder me from having &s;uch a watch, as will at once be &s;trong, and cut a hand&s;ome figure?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ford.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;uppo&s;e, then, that would make you happy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; quite happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ford.</SPEAKER>
<P>I could wi&s;h that my fortune were &s;ufficient to convince you, by experience, how fallacious is the happine&s;s proceeding from &s;uch trifles. Look ye; I would lay whatever wager you thought proper, that before a fortnight were well over, you would hardly ca&s;t a look upon your watch; that in a month you would forget to wind it up, and very quickly after cea&s;e to keep it in a better &s;tate of order than your own ideas.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not talk of wagers, papa! You would be &s;ure to lo&s;e!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ford.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I will not lay; not that I apprehend I &s;hould come off the lo&s;er, but becau&s;e a trial would be nece&s;&s;ary, which might co&s;t you dear as long as you live.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>So then you think, papa, that a hand&s;ome watch would only make me mi&s;erable?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Think &s;o, Clara? I am &s;ure it would have that effect; for all our happine&s;s on earth con&s;i&s;ts in being &s;atisfied with &s;uch a &s;ituation as the will of Providence has meant us. There is no condition in the world &s;o humble, or &s;o elevated, but a vain ambition in it may induce us to imagine our&s;elves in want of every thing that our neigh|bour po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. It is ambition that torments the hu&s;band|man, however ea&s;y in his circum&s;tances, and inclines him to behold his neighbour's field with envy, while it &s;timu|lates the ma&s;ter of a mighty empire, and per&s;uades him that &s;ome province bordering on his realm is wanting to complete the figure of its boundary. Thence &s;pring tho&s;e cruel wars which princes carry on to de&s;olate their people; and tho&s;e law-&s;uits in which individuals are engaged, or tho&s;e quarrels that di&s;grace man's nature. What were your ideas with regard to that Mi&s;s Richmond that you men|tioned ju&s;t now, when you were looking at the hand&s;ome watch that &s;he di&s;played at her &s;ide? Did you feel within your bo&s;om that alacrity of friend&s;hip, &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in her favour, which you once cheri&s;hed? Think, would
<PB N="136" REF="148">you have done her, at that moment, any &s;ervice, or at lea&s;t with equal joy as ye&s;terday? That &s;ecret enmity with which her watch in&s;pired you again&s;t her, would not &s;uch a watch in&s;pire your friend, or very po&s;&s;ibly your &s;i&s;ters, with the &s;ame again&s;t you al&s;o? Think then, for how de&s;picable an enjoyment you would break the deare&s;t ties of friend&s;hip and alliance, and the affection which nature plants within us! Who would think her&s;elf happy upon &s;uch conditions?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>O papa, you make me &s;hudder!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, my &s;weet Clara, entertain no more of the&s;e unrea&s;onable wi&s;hes; they cannot but de&s;troy your happine&s;s. What is there wanting, that you can find really u&s;eful, in the &s;ituation which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rovidence allots you? Have you not good food in plenty? and convenient raiment for the various &s;ea&s;ons of the year? Does not my love provide you ma&s;ters to improve your under&s;tanding, while I form your heart, and do my utmo&s;t to endue you with tho&s;e &s;everal accompli&s;hments that will in future make you welcome to all decent company? You want, it &s;eems, at pre&s;ent, a gold watch enriched with diamonds! Should I get you &s;uch a watch, how would you look to|morrow upon your fal&s;e pearl ear-rings? Would you leave off teazing me, till I had bought you real pearls? Nor would this be all; for you would then want foreign lace, fine &s;ilks, and waiting-women to attend you. People cannot go on foot, like others, through the &s;treets, when they are pompou&s;ly &s;et out from head to foot; but mu&s;t have footmen, fa&s;hionable carriages, and high-bred hor&s;es. You would want all the&s;e, and having once obtained them, would be fit indeed to go to operas and a&s;&s;emblies, or pay vi&s;its at the hou&s;es of our fir&s;t-rate quality; but to receive them in your turn, you mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;plendid habitation, and give &s;umptuous entertainments. Con&s;ider then, if I &s;hould &s;atisfy your fir&s;t caprice, how many wants would follow! They would every day go on in|crea&s;ing, till in con&s;equence of having wi&s;hed to ri&s;e above your &s;tation in one article of luxury, you would, perhaps, come to want the nece&s;&s;ary things of life. Look round about you, and ob&s;erve how many &s;uffer real indigence at pre&s;ent, who &s;o lately, as I may &s;ay, as ye&s;terday, were wa&s;ting an e&s;tate &s;ufficient for their happine&s;s. Re|flect what very probably would be your ca&s;e, and that too
<PB N="137" REF="149">of your &s;i&s;ters, if my great affection for you did not, as it does at pre&s;ent, turn the&s;e &s;ad examples into matters of in&s;truction! I have frequently been tired while I was walking through the &s;treets upon my bu&s;ine&s;s. A good carriage would have ea&s;ed my fatigue, as much as it would have flattered my vanity. By allotting to the purcha&s;e of a coach the money that I lay out on your education, maintenance and amu&s;ements, I might po&s;&s;ibly be rolling in it for a time; but in the end, what would my fortune be, and yours? I &s;hould behold you every day &s;ink deeper than the day before into &s;tupidity, and have no rea&s;on to expect from you, in my old age, tho&s;e cares which I had refu&s;ed your childhood. For a few &s;hort years, con&s;umed in all the in&s;olence of luxury, I &s;hould be doomed to langui&s;h out the remnant of my life in that well merited contempt which a guilty poverty draws after it. With what a&s;&s;urance could I think to an&s;wer at the judgment|&s;eat of God, for the omi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e duties towards you, which the will of Providence impo&s;es upon every father; when I &s;hould have nothing to leave you for your inhe|ritance but the &s;ad example of my guilty conduct? I &s;hould then fini&s;h my life in the convul&s;ions of remor&s;e, de&s;pair, and terror; and your cur&s;es might even execrate my a&s;hes.</P>
<P>O! papa, cried Clara, embracing him, how fooli&s;hly have I been wi&s;hing! But no watch &s;et with diamonds now! On the contrary, if I had one, I would in&s;tantly return it.</P>
<P>Mr. Ford was rejoiced to &s;ee his daughter &s;o open to rea&s;on and per&s;ua&s;ion, and embraced her with the greate&s;t heart-felt &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>From that happy moment, Clara re&s;umed her former gaiety; and whenever afterwards &s;he &s;aw any of her little friends make boa&s;t of precious &s;tones, or other ornaments about them, was inclined much rather to take pity on their vanity, than to look on them with the &s;lighte&s;t envy.</P>

<HEAD>CAROLINE.</HEAD>
<P>THE amiable little Caroline, of whom I have &s;poken once or twice before, went out to Hamp&s;tead for a few weeks with her mama. She had taken &s;ome new &s;hoes for wear during her &s;tay there; but by dint of run|ning about in the garden, which was the u&s;ual &s;cene of her play, they were all very &s;oon out at the toes.

The &s;ervants went to &s;eek for her in the garden, the plea&s;ure-ground, and all the rooms in the hou&s;e: but no Caroline.

<P>It is true, &s;he feeds them regularly: but I need tell you why;&mdash;that we may eat them, when they are fat: but the wild gee&s;e have no fear of this &s;ort hang|ing over them. As they get food without a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they enjoy the privileges of their freedom: and thus it is too among mankind. He that &s;hould without a blu&s;h rely entirely on the care and forethought of another for his maintenance, would lo&s;e his birth-right, and be forced to &s;ell him&s;elf for bread; while he, who on the other hand provides for what he wants, acquires new faculties, and is abundantly &s;upported. Not that we &s;hould live apart from one another, or be wholly occupied upon our&s;elves; for on the contrary, the&s;e birds, by who&s;e behaviour I would have you regulate your conduct, form among them&s;elves a regular &s;ociety. They &s;it upon the eggs, and nur&s;e the young ones of &s;uch mothers as have lo&s;t their lives by any accident. They likewi&s;e aid each other in their long and painful flights. They take their &s;tation in the front, by turns, to guide the flock, and regulate their flight. Now, Richard, you mu&s;t know, the&s;e forts of gee&s;e originally formed but one.

<P>From Port&s;mouth, my good lady. I was married to a fi&s;herman. One night they pre&s;&s;ed him, and he &s;erved two years on board a man of war. He came home almo&s;t dying with the &s;curvy. He had lo&s;t his &s;trength, and could not work. I was obliged to &s;ell his
<PB N="142" REF="154">nets, that I might buy him phy&s;ic; but his illne&s;s la&s;ted very long. Our creditors laid hold of every thing that we had; and as we could not pay our debts, our landlord turned us out of doors. A neighbour, very nearly as di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed as we were, took us in, and robbed his children of a part of what they had to eat, that we might not be left to peri&s;h. Being brought to &s;uch a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation, I fell ill with grief; and &s;hortly after, my poor hu&s;band died. As &s;oon as I was a little better, I re&s;olved to be no further burthen&s;ome to my good benefactor, but &s;et out to &s;eek a&s;&s;i&s;tance from a worthy lady with whom I once lived as &s;ervant, at Ep&s;om.

Alas! his &s;ituation adds to my affliction. Having neither &s;hoes nor &s;tockings, he was walking ye&s;terday acro&s;s a common, and unfortu|nately a thorn run into his foot. I took it out; but his fatigue has grievou&s;ly inflamed the wound: his leg is now quite &s;welled, and he can hardly touch the ground, it gives him &s;o much pain; for heaven's &s;ake, my good lady, have the charity to give me two or three old rags to wrap the wound up when I have wa&s;hed it, and a bit of bread for the&s;e poor children.</P>

Should we add it to your pocket-money, there would be then a &s;ufficiency to have a cart for the&s;e poor people, and to procure them victuals until they reach Ep&s;om: but the &s;acrifice, I mu&s;t acknowledge, is too great. I dare not recommend it. Our long wi&s;hed for day's excur&s;ion would be lo&s;t this year.</P>

<P>But I &s;hall have no plea&s;ure when I think that I am &s;ailing at my ea&s;e, while &s;ix poor people drag along the road, ju&s;t ready to drop down with wearine&s;s, becau&s;e I had no pity on them.</P>

<P>Do you &s;ay nothing, Loui&s;a?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Loui&s;a.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was thinking all the while, mama, that our plea&s;ure is not lo&s;t; for we &s;hall follow them a mile or two, while they are riding in the cart, which will be &s;till a walk for us, and very plea&s;ant.</P>

<STAGE>(Mrs. Darley now goes in, and &s;ends a &s;ervant out to pay the watermen. The three young children go and come between the hou&s;e and garden, with a&s;&s;i&s;tance for the man, the wo|man, and her children; Celia helps the woman, while &s;he tends the old man's wound, and Harriet and Loui&s;a give the children victuals; after which they all return to their mama.)</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, my dear mama! you &s;hould have &s;een with how much eagerne&s;s and joy the children looked at both Loui&s;a and my&s;elf, when we were come with milk and bread to feed them! They all crouded about their mother, looked up in her face, and were &s;o glad that they did not know what to do!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loui&s;a.</SPEAKER>
<P>For my part, I began to be afraid they would have eat me up, &s;o fami&s;hed were they, and de&s;irous to be eating!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Celia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure, mama, the elder girl mu&s;t be a charming child. She would not touch a bit till &s;he had made her little brother eat, who is too young as yet to feed alone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Darley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor thing! &s;he is greatly to be pitied. If the care of looking to the little ones be always laid upon her, &s;he will have no opportunity of getting any thing like knowledge, and be very mi&s;erable all her life-time; whereas, had &s;he the means of learning &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;he might prove of &s;ervice to her mother, and a&s;&s;i&s;t her in bringing up the others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loui&s;a.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, mama, do one thing for her. Let her &s;tay with us. I will teach her whatever I know my&s;elf. She will be able very &s;oon to knit and few, when &s;he may &s;ell her work, and &s;end the money to her mother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>No bad thought, mama, I take it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Celia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; do us this plea&s;ure, pray mama; for what a pity that the poor girl &s;hould come to want, merely for not knowing how to work at any bu&s;ine&s;s, like the poor old woman that we all know. She would then turn beg|gar, and receive no benefit from what we are now doing for her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Darley.</SPEAKER>
<P>But do you know, my dear, what you would undertake? Reflect a little.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Celia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, mama?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="146" REF="158">
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Darley.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will tell you why. If we &s;hould take this girl into the hou&s;e, we mu&s;t give her cloaths. I can|not go to the expence, unle&s;s you are willing that I &s;hall take a little from <HI>your</HI> dre&s;s, and make up by that means what it will co&s;t. And &s;o, in&s;tead of tho&s;e &s;ilk &s;lips that I meant to give you very &s;hortly, you mu&s;t be content with linen gowns, or perhaps &s;tuff, and have no feathers or Italian flowers upon your head; nothing but a ribband round your hat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Celia.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, mama, I told Mi&s;s Raby and her &s;i&s;ter Kitty that I &s;hould very &s;hortly have a fine &s;ilk &s;lip as good as theirs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>A linen gown will never look &s;o well as one of &s;ilk, will it, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dariey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly it will not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(having thought a little.)</STAGE>
<P>But if that will not become me &s;o well as &s;ilk would, the poor girl will cut a much wor&s;e figure in her rags.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Celia.</SPEAKER>
<P>And then, if &s;he continues thus half uncovered much longer, &s;he may run the ri&s;que of being taken ill, be&s;ides the inconveniences that want of clean cloathing may bring upon her; for you know, mama, you have often told me how unwhole&s;ome dirty cloaths are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Darley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, indeed, I have; but you, Loui&s;a, what &s;ay you to my propo&s;al? Should you like to put a &s;tuff gown on?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loui&s;a.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! very much, mama. One jumps the better for it. I remember what the <HI>Children's Friend</HI> &s;aid lately in the &s;tory of poor Matilda, who&s;e fine cloaths occa&s;ioned her &s;o much anxiety, when &s;he was out a walk|ing with her little friends and &s;ought to mortify them with the &s;ight of her &s;ilk &s;lip, embroidered &s;hoes, and frizzled head of hair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Darley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, we are likely, I perceive, to fix on &s;omething; and yet this is not the whole. Loui&s;a, it was you that fir&s;t offered to in&s;truct the little girl in &s;ewing; and of cour&s;e I ought to give the preference to you in &s;uch a charge; but then you mu&s;t confe&s;s your&s;elf a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> too giddy for it, and be&s;ides not qualified entirely. Neither I or Celia can pretend to undertake it, as the bu&s;ine&s;s of the hou&s;e already takes up our attention. W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> then, Harriet, I give that employment to you.</P>

<P>Wait &s;ome few days, however, till you thank me. You can hardly gue&s;s what patience you will need to go through the employ. I know you, Harriet; you are &s;ometimes very ha&s;ty; and at fir&s;t you mu&s;t expect that the little girl will hardly comprehend your meaning.

<P>I mu&s;t &s;ay the truth, mama, that is what I cannot promi&s;e: I &s;uppo&s;e, you recollect the other day when you reproved me. I could then have laid my life that I &s;hould never do the &s;ame again; but you had hardly left the room, when poor Loui&s;a went to put her &s;tockings on, and broke a &s;titch that ran from top to bottom. I had &s;o much work to take it up again, I fell into a pa&s;&s;ion, and even beat her. I was quite a&s;hamed a moment after; but it was done, and could not be mended then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Darley.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is &s;ingular, indeed, that children who have need them&s;elves of &s;uch indulgence, &s;hould have none for others! Truly, you would cut a pretty figure in &s;ociety if I were never to correct you for this fault.</P>

<P>YOU remember, my dear little friends, the raging heat that made la&s;t &s;ummer &s;o remarkable. I recol|lect it, I a&s;&s;ure you, to my &s;orrow; &s;ince by having an effect upon my health, it hindered me, for many weeks, from &s;atisfying your impatience to hear from me.

We were all engaged in innocent amu&s;ement, when a furious &s;torm began to ri&s;e: the thunder rolled above us with a dreadful noi&s;e, and &s;hook the hou&s;e to its very foundation, while the lightning &s;eemed as if it would con&s;ume the dwelling every moment. One young lady of the company could not help being frightened. There were heard cries and &s;hrieks pro|ceeding from a chamber-maid in one of the apartments.

<P>What circum&s;tance has happened, my dear life? You &s;ent the children to me; and I thought I &s;aw upon their countenances &s;omething not quite natural to them. I conceived it not &s;o proper to a&s;k <HI>them</HI> the rea&s;on, but would come and know the whole from you. Hide nothing from me, I be&s;eech you! Has any new misfor|tune

</SP>
<SP>

<P>No, my dear! With your a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I can bear all &s;orrows; and if unfore&s;een affliction were to come upon me, would not he&s;itate to tell you of it, after the experience that I have had of your philo&s;ophy and fortitude.

<P>What then could occa&s;ion the unea&s;ine&s;s that I noticed in their countenances?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. Barton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our old &s;oldier cau&s;ed it, who&s;e exce&s;s of zeal and friend&s;hip for me carried him &s;o far, while they were pre&s;ent, as to vent complains concerning the inju&s;tice of my lot. I ob&s;erved that they were affected by the &s;trength of his expre&s;&s;ions; and becau&s;e I apprehended &s;uch invectives might in&s;pire di&s;couragement, I directed them to go into your chamber; &s;o that Pipes's murmurs might not make a bad impre&s;&s;ion on them, being followed in&s;tantly by your care&s;&s;es.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Barton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor unhappy little things! Alas, they know not what a &s;ad condition they are to experience upon earth!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. Barton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope their fortune will not be &s;o la|mentable, as your motherly affection &s;eems to fear; for hitherto, at lea&s;t, they have no great occa&s;ion to complain of their condition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Barton.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! my dear, when they are utterly deprived of all the advantages that they might rea&s;onably have expected in life?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. Barton.</SPEAKER>
<P>They never knew them; therefore, never can the want of tho&s;e advantages afflict them. Po&s;&s;ibly they might have only &s;erved to &s;often and unnerve their &s;trength, as well as under&s;tanding. The hard life to which they have been u&s;ed, has given them a robu&s;t and &s;ound con&s;titution, and an energy of mind. In&s;tead of pur&s;uing frivolous or puerile amu&s;ements, they already know how to convert their labour into plea&s;ure. If God's providence &s;hould grant them any of the gifts of fortune, they will therefore yield the more enjoyment: but, &s;up|po&s;ing they are all decreed to pa&s;s away their days in the privation of this life's conveniences, they will have learnt to undergo their fortune without murmurs or complainings. Shall I tell you what I think, my dear? I do not look on
<PB N="156" REF="168">the condition to which we are de&s;tined, as &s;o very lament|able; for, &s;urrounded by the plea&s;ures of the world, &s;hould we have known tho&s;e tender &s;entiments for each other, which we certainly have learnt, in what men call the &s;chool of adver&s;ity? Hurried on by plea&s;ure, we &s;hould each have gone in que&s;t of friends who would have left us in adver&s;ity, and perhaps aggravated our afflictions by their treachery; while now, afflicted as we are, we are convinced that we have it in our power to make each other happy, by our mutual love and friend&s;hip. There are many mi&s;erable individuals in the world, who are even de&s;titute of bread to eat: we have never experienced &s;uch a want, though we have not &s;tooped to procure our bread by di&s;honour. If, as is the ca&s;e, we are nece&s;&s;itated to put up with what may certainly be called a very common diet, that our children may not want for education,&mdash;we enjoy, on the other hand, their gratitude, and their im|provement in knowledge. We are con&s;cious to our&s;elves that we have neglected no one tittle of our duty to them. Every generous notion that they po&s;&s;e&s;s is our work: it is our le&s;&s;ons and example that have enabled them to po&s;&s;e&s;s it. They will do no laudable or virtuous action in their future lives but what an hone&s;t pride will permit us to attribute to our&s;elves; and granting that any one among them &s;hould be rai&s;ed into di&s;tinction by his merit, I am confident, he will not leave us in old age, when we may more particularly want his &s;uccour.</P>

<SPEAKER>Capt. Barton.</SPEAKER>
<P>On the contrary, dear partner, it is your con&s;tancy that upholds my fortitude. Without &s;upport, I &s;hould have long &s;ince &s;ank beneath the burthen of my &s;orrows; but &s;eeing you renounce the delicacies, and &s;ubdue the weakne&s;&s;es in&s;eparable from your &s;ex, that you might properly di&s;charge your duty, how could I have &s;eemed le&s;s firm than you were, and not have blu&s;hed at being called a man?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Barton.</SPEAKER>
<P>A&s;cribe not &s;o much honour to me, for the &s;acrifices that I have made. They mu&s;t be nothing to a mother's &s;en&s;ibility: and I would make &s;till greater, if, on &s;uch conditions, I might have the pro&s;pect of a happier fortune to befal my children. But, my dear, have you renounced all thoughts of &s;oliciting your friends? Are
<PB N="157" REF="169">you without a hope, that &s;uch &s;olicitations would be at|tended with &s;ucce&s;s?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. Barton.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know the i&s;&s;ue of my former appli|cations. If then I experienced nothing but denials, when more recent &s;ervices &s;poke for me &s;halt I hope a better fortune now? and if the hollow-hearted friend, who then deceived me, would not &s;econd my ju&s;t expectations with his influence, who will now e&s;pou&s;e the application of a man &s;o many years forgot? My very &s;ilence &s;ince that pe|riod would be urged as a pretext for new refu&s;als, and fre&s;h di&s;appointments but re-open wounds as yet not quite healed up. I have thrown away almo&s;t my whole de|pendence to procure me nothing but vexation; I &s;hall therefore hardly be &s;o ra&s;h, as to con&s;ume what is left me in &s;uch &s;teps as, if they failed, would end in de&s;peration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Barton.</SPEAKER>
<P>De&s;peration?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. Barton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; though they &s;hould co&s;t me nothing but the time that I mu&s;t purloin from the in&s;truction of my children. If I dur&s;t have any hopes, and &s;hould again be di&s;appointed, I am convinced, I could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;urvive; or &s;hould, at lea&s;t, drag on the wretched remnant of my life in &s;orrow. No, dear &s;pou&s;e; let us not imi|tate tho&s;e parents, who imagine that they have done enough, in yielding &s;ome &s;mall portion of their &s;uperflui|ties, and that too with reluctance, that their children may obtain an education. Let us prove our love, by dedi|cating even our nece&s;&s;aries to their wants. Let us con&s;ent to live on bread, if &s;uch a &s;acrifice be needful, that in future they may &s;hew them&s;elves to have been educated in a manner worthy of us.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. Barton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have already &s;uch a hope concerning Edward. Child although he is, yet I have frequently remarked his depth of under&s;tanding, openne&s;s of temper, and ingenuous way of thinking; qualities that I would de&s;ire to find in my friend. He will have two motives for &s;eeking advancement, and tho&s;e &s;uch as operate very forcibly on noble minds: he will have ob&s;tacles to over|come, and thereby &s;o much the more glory to acquire. With what ardour have I ob&s;erved him, and particularly the&s;e two years la&s;t pa&s;t, to re&s;ign him&s;elf entirely up to &s;tudy, and dige&s;t the greate&s;t difficulties! With what en|thu&s;ia&s;m
<PB N="158" REF="170">has he been &s;eized at the recital of &s;ome glorious action! I have often noted him retiring, as it were in thought, that he might narrowly examine the tran&s;actions both of Rome and Sparta, and ob&s;erve the infancy of their mo&s;t celebrated heroes. In a &s;earch like this, no wonder that the atchievements of a Cyrus &s;hould inflame his nature to re&s;emble him in temperance, fortitude, and reputation. On the whole, I verily believe that nothing but &s;ome happy circum&s;tance is wanting, to proclaim him &s;uch already, as he may one day &s;hew him&s;elf to be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Barton.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, my dear, in &s;uch a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tuation as he is doomed to at pre&s;ent, when, alas! can we have hope that this happy circum&s;tance will happen?</P>

<HEAD>THE WIG, THE SHOULDER OF MUTTON, THE LANTERNS, THE SACK OF CORN, AND THE STILTS.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Friendly was one afternoon at home, and in the drawing room with his four children, Lambert, Charlotte, Dorothy and Felix, when three gentlemen who&s;e names were Vernon, Fairfield, and Fitzwilliam, came to &s;ee him. They were Mr. Friendly's olde&s;t friends; the children likewi&s;e loved them greatly, and were very much rejoiced to &s;ee them. They would always li&s;ten to their conver&s;ation with a greedy ear, as being not only in&s;tructive, but amu&s;ing; and on this particular occa&s;ion &s;at with &s;uch attention, that they let the night come on without once thinking that they wanted candles. Mr. Vernon was, by this time, relating a very curious circum|&s;tance that happened to him in his travels, when a dread|ful noi&s;e was heard from the &s;econd pair of &s;tairs. The children crowded together in a fright, behind their father's elbow chair, in&s;tead of going out and &s;eeing what was the matter, as Mr. Friendly thought they would have done. He had bid Lambert, his elde&s;t &s;on, &s;tep out; but Lambert pa&s;&s;ed the order to his &s;i&s;ter Charlotte; Charlotte to her younger &s;i&s;ter Dorothy; and Dorothy, to Felix.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="178">During the&s;e negociations, which indeed were all tran&s;acted in a minute's time, the noi&s;e continued, and came nearer; but not one among them left his &s;tation.</P>
<P>Mr. Friendly eyed them, with a look which &s;eemed to a&s;k if he, or his friends, &s;hould take the trouble to ri&s;e, and &s;ee what accident had happened?</P>
<P>Upon this the four began their march together, towards the door, but in the figure of a &s;quare battalion, each &s;up|ported by the other. They were now come near the door, when Lambert, with a fearful &s;tep, advanced his foot and opened it; but in&s;tantly fell back into his former place. The little ones, however, were not in the lea&s;t delivered from their terror, when they &s;aw an apparition clothed in white, and crawling on all fours. In &s;hort, our <HI>So&s;ias,</HI> at the &s;ight, turned tail, and &s;etting up a &s;hriek, retreated towards their father, who ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and going towards the landing-place, cried out, who is there?</P>
<P>I, &s;ir, replied a voice, that &s;eemed to i&s;&s;ue from the flooring.</P>
<P>I, &s;aid Mr. Friendly? And pray who are you?</P>
<P>The barber's boy, &s;ir, looking for your wig.</P>
<P>Think, little friends, what bur&s;ts of laughter now &s;uc|ceeded their preceding &s;ilence. Mr. Friendly rang the bell for light, and when it came, perceived the wig|box broken to pieces, and the unfortunate wig entangled about the boy's right foot.</P>
<P>The tumult of this laughable adventure &s;carce was over, when the father ridiculed the folly of his children, a&s;king what they had been thus afraid of? They could hardly tell them&s;elves, as having been accu&s;tomed from the cra|dle not to be afraid at night; and as the &s;everal &s;ervants in the family were expre&s;sly forbidden to tell them any fooli&s;h &s;tories about gho&s;ts or goblins.</P>
<P>Their preceding conver&s;ation being thus deranged, it came at la&s;t to turn upon this &s;ubject, and they wi&s;hed to know what could occa&s;ion tho&s;e &s;urpri&s;ing fears, &s;o com|mon to all children in darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>It is the natural effects of darkne&s;s, and that only, an|&s;wered Mr. Vernon. As children cannot properly di&s;tin|gui&s;h objects round them in the dark, their imagi|nation, which is always &s;mitten with the marvellous,
<PB N="167" REF="179">&s;hapes them out extraordinary figures, by enlarging or contracting what they look at, ju&s;t as circum&s;tances govern, Upon this, the notion of their weakne&s;s ea&s;ily per&s;uades them they are utterly unable to re&s;i&s;t tho&s;e mon&s;ters which they think armed to hurt them. Terror thus obtains po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, and too frequently impre&s;&s;es fears which have the wor&s;t of con&s;equences.</P>
<P>They would be a&s;hamed, &s;aid Mr. Friendly, if they &s;aw, in open day, what often gives them &s;o much fright by night.</P>
<P>It was for all the world, &s;aid Lambert, ju&s;t as if I &s;aw it: but I needed only touch it, and then I knew very well what it was.</P>
<P>Oh yes, &s;aid Charlotte, you have given us indeed an admirable token of your courage. <HI>Needed only to touch it!</HI> And therefore, I &s;uppo&s;e, you would have let me <HI>touch</HI> the door, but that I pu&s;hed you forward.</P>
<P>It becomes you well, to talk about my fear, &s;aid Lam|bert; you that got behind poor Felix.</P>
<P>And poor little Dorothy behind me, added the &s;ly Felix.</P>
<P>Come, &s;aid Mr. Friendly, I can &s;ee, you have nothing to reproach each other with. But Lambert's notion is not, upon that account, le&s;s rational; for as in all the mon&s;trous &s;hapes that we image out continually to our|&s;elves, we have but natural accidents to fear; we may ward off all danger by the &s;en&s;e of feeling which di&s;tingui&s;hes what frequently deceives the &s;ight. It is the neglect of this precaution in our infancy, that makes &s;o many of us fancy gho&s;ts in every object round about us. I remember, on this head, a &s;tory, comical enough, which I will tell you.</P>
<P>The four children now came round their father, crying out, a &s;tory! oh a &s;tory! and their father thus began it.</P>
<P>In my father's hou&s;e, there lived a maid-&s;ervant, who one night was &s;ent for beer into the cellar. We were all &s;eated at the table, but could not &s;et eyes upon the &s;ervant or beer. My mother, who was rather of a ha&s;ty temper, ro&s;e from table, and went out to call her. As it chanced, the cellar-door was open, but &s;he could not make the &s;ervant hear. My mother ordered me to bring a candle, and go down into the cellar with her. I went fir&s;t to light the way: but as I looked &s;traight forward,
<PB N="168" REF="180">did not mind my &s;teps, and all at once fell over &s;omething rather &s;oft. My light went out, and getting up, I put my hand upon another hand, quite motionle&s;s and cold. Upon the cry that I uttered, down came the cook maid, with a candle. She drew near, and we di&s;covered the poor girl &s;tretched all along upon the ground, face downward, in a &s;woon. We rai&s;ed her up, and let her have a &s;melling bottle. She recovered her &s;pirits; but had hardly lifted up her eyes, when &s;he cried out: There! there &s;he is! there &s;till! Who is there? replied my mother. That tall white woman, an&s;wered &s;he, there hanging in the corner. See! &s;ee! &s;ee! We looked the way that &s;he pointed; and in fact did &s;ee, as &s;he de&s;cribed it, &s;omething white and of a tolerable length &s;u&s;pended in a corner. Is it only <HI>that?</HI> replied the cook-maid, bur&s;ting out a laughing. Why that is nothing but a leg of mutton which I bought la&s;t night. I hung it there, that it might be quite fre&s;h, and cool; and put a napkin round it, to keep off the flies. She ran immediately, took off the napkin, and exhibited the leg of mutton to her fellow-&s;ervant, who &s;tood trembling with fear. It was above a quarter of an hour before &s;he was convinced of her ridiculous mi&s;take. She would at fir&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon it, that the phantom &s;tared her in the face with &s;aucer eyes; that &s;he had turned to run away but that the gho&s;t had followed her, fa&s;tened on her petti|coat, and &s;eized upon the candle in her hand. What hap|pened after this &s;he could not tell.</P>
<P>It is very ea&s;y to explain all this, &s;aid Mr. Vernon; and a&s;&s;ign the rea&s;on, why your &s;ervant fancied thus ex|travagantly. When the fright fir&s;t &s;eized her and &s;he &s;wooned, the circulation of the blood was &s;topped, and &s;he could not run away; &s;he thought &s;he had been held. Her limbs were deprived of &s;trength, &s;o that &s;he could not hold the candle, and therefore &s;uppo&s;ed that the &s;pectre took it from her.</P>
<P>We are happy, added he, that the under&s;tanding and good ten&s;e of people has begun to di&s;&s;ipate the&s;e fooli&s;h notions concerning gho&s;ts and goblins. There was once at me of &s;o much g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rance, that the&s;e ideas mixed with &s;uppo&s;itions notions, and deprived the bolde&s;t of their con|rage; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut thank heaven, they are at length completely done away in towns; though they &s;ub&s;i&s;t, as &s;trong as ever,
<PB N="169" REF="181">in the country, which is &s;till &s;uppo&s;ed to be inhabited by witches, and a train of evil &s;pirits. What I am going now to tell you, is a laughable example of it.</P>
<P>Tom Stubbs, a labouring man, one evening was return|ing from a fair, with Edmund and Su&s;an, his two children. It was towards the end of autumn, when the day &s;huts in betimes.</P>
<P>Tom going by an ale hou&s;e, told the children that he would enter and refre&s;h him&s;elf a little, ordering them, as they were well acquainted with the road before them, to go onward, and in half a dozen minutes he would overtake them. Edmund and Su&s;an therefore went on &s;lowly, talking of the drollery of a puppet-&s;how that they had been &s;eeing, and, as well as they were able, talking like the wooden figures in it. All at once, about the middle of a path which pa&s;&s;ing round the corner of a little wood, came, where they &s;tood into the public road, their eye was caught by &s;omething very bright that &s;eemed to dance upon the ground, or ri&s;e and fall by turns. The father having formerly been a &s;oldier, had frequently told them that they mu&s;t never be afraid of what by night and at a di&s;tance might a&s;&s;ume a frightful figure, but go boldly up to it, when they would find it nothing. Edmund had forgot all this in&s;truction. He could hard|ly &s;peak, he &s;hook all over, and per&s;pired abundantly; whereas his &s;i&s;ter laughed to &s;ee him frightened, &s;aying that &s;he would go and &s;ee the apparition nearer. Edmund all in vain, a&s;&s;ured her that it was a gho&s;t, who certain|ly would twi&s;t her neck off. She was not di&s;couraged by the&s;e fooli&s;h notions, but went onward towards the light, without once &s;topping.</P>
<P>She was come within a dozen yards of it, when, behold ye, &s;he di&s;cerned the very puppet-&s;how-man who had en|tertained her at the fair, and who was &s;eeking &s;omething with his lantern.</P>
<P>For in drawing out his handkerchief, his pur&s;e had fol|lowed; and for upwards of ten minutes, he had looked about to find it on the ground, about the &s;pot. Su&s;an, who had always her wits about her, went and &s;earched the hedges, and found it hanging on a &s;prig. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w|man gave her, as a recompence, the punchinello which had made her laugh &s;o much; and as they went a|long, in&s;tructed her how to twitch the &s;trings, and
<PB N="170" REF="182">to make it play in that diverting manner that &s;he had lately &s;een.</P>
<P>They were hardly at home, when Tom came in. The puppet-man informed him of what had happened, and extolled Su&s;an's courage. It was now extremely dark, however, and little Edmund was not to be &s;een. Tom began to fear &s;ome accident; and there|fore took a link, and with Su&s;an, ran to &s;ee if he could find him.</P>
<P>They went very fa&s;t, and hallooed, as they ran, by turns. At la&s;t they heard, a great way off, the voice of &s;ome one in di&s;tre&s;s. They made up to it, and found Edmund in a ditch, unable to get out. He was quite co|vered with a cake of mud from head to foot, and had his face and hands torn &s;adly with the brambles.</P>
<P>How the deuce came you here? &s;aid his father, as he helped him out.</P>
<P>Ah father, I was running with my head turned towards a jack-a-lantern that ran after me, and, as I could not &s;ee my way before me, I tumbled in here. I wanted to get out, but could find only brambles to lay hold of. See how they have &s;cratched my face and hands; and thereupon he began his cries and lamentations afre&s;h.</P>
<P>Tom reproved him very roughly for his cowardice; but Edmund was a deal more vexed when told his &s;i&s;ter's luck. He could not be con&s;oled for having lo&s;t his &s;hare in the diverting punchinello which &s;he knew, by this time, how to play off with great dexterity.</P>
<P>The lantern, in your tale, &s;aid Mr. Fairfield, makes me recollect a &s;ingular adventure with a lantern in it, that performed its part &s;o well, as to affright, not merely &s;uch a little pea&s;ant as your Edmund, but a whole village.</P>
<P>I was coming home one night on hor&s;e-back, from a vi&s;it that I had ju&s;t before been making to a number of the neighbouring villages, where I had quartered my recruits. There had fallen a great deal of rain that day, &s;ince noon, and during all the evening, which had broken up the road, and it was raining &s;till with equal violence; but being forced to join my Company the next morning, I &s;et out, provided with a lantern, ha|ving to pa&s;s a narrow defile between two mountains.
<PB N="171" REF="183">I had cleared it, when a gu&s;t of wind took off my hat, and carried it &s;o far that I de&s;paired of recovering it again, and therefore gave the matter up. By great good fortune I had on me a large &s;carlet cloak. I covered up my head and &s;houlders with it, leaving nothing but a little hole to &s;ee my way and breathe through; and for fear the wind &s;hould take a fancy to my cloak, as well as hat, I pa&s;&s;ed my right arm round my body to &s;ecure it, &s;o that riding on in this po&s;ition, you may ea&s;ily con|ceive that my lantern, which I held in my right hand, was under my left &s;houlder. At the entrance of a village, on a hill, I met three travellers, who no &s;ooner &s;aw me, than they ran away, as if they were po&s;&s;e&s;t. For my part, I went on upon the gallop, and when come into the town, alighted at an inn, where I de&s;igned to re&s;t my&s;elf a little; but &s;oon after who &s;hould enter but my three poltroons, as pale as death it&s;elf. They told the landlord and his people, trembling as they &s;poke, that on the road they had encountered a great figure of a man all over blood, who&s;e head was like a flame of fire, and to increa&s;e the wonder, placed beneath his &s;houlder. He was mounted on a dreadful hor&s;e, &s;aid they, quite black before, and grey behind, which, notwith&s;tanding it was lame, he &s;purred and whipped right up the mountain with extraordi|nary &s;wiftne&s;s. Here they ended their relation. They had taken care to &s;pread the alarm as they were flying from this wondrous apparition, and the people had come with them to the inn in &s;uch a drove, that upwards of a hundred were all &s;queezed together, opening their mouths and ears at this tremendous &s;tory. To make up in &s;ome &s;ort for my di&s;mal journey, I re&s;olved to laugh a little and be merry at their co&s;t, intending at the &s;ame time to cure them of &s;uch frights, by &s;howing them their folly in the pre&s;ent in|&s;tance. With this view I mounted my hor&s;e again behind the inn, went round about till I had rode the di&s;tance of half a mile; when turning I di&s;po&s;ed of my accoutrements, that is to &s;ay, my clock and lantern, as before, and on I came upon a gallop towards the inn. You &s;hould have &s;een the frighted mob of pea&s;ants how they hid their faces at the &s;ight and crowded into the pa&s;&s;age. There was no one but the ho&s;t that had courage to remain and keep his eye upon me. I was now before the door, on which I &s;hifted the po&s;ition of my lantern, let my cloak
<PB N="172" REF="184">drop down upon my &s;houlders, and appeared the &s;ame figure as he had &s;een me by his kitchen fire. It was not without real difficulty that we could bring the &s;imple people who had crowded in for &s;afety from their terror: the three travellers in particular, as the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion was &s;till &s;trong within them, could not credit what they &s;aw. We fini&s;hed by a hearty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ugh at their expence, and drinking to the man who&s;e head was like a flame of fire and placed beneath his &s;houlder. This was what I meant to tell you, and perhaps if &s;uch conviction of their ground|le&s;s apprehen&s;ions had not been afforded them, the &s;tory of my &s;trange appearance would have pa&s;&s;ed from one old woman to another, and for centuries occa&s;ioned mortal fears through all the country.</P>
<P>It depended only on me too, in the &s;ame manner, &s;aid Mr. Fitzwilliam, to afford the &s;ubject of a fine &s;tory to the go&s;&s;ips of my county, in an adventure that be&s;el me one night, about the time of my leaving &s;chool.</P>
<P>I was come home at Mid&s;ummer, and had received an invitation from my uncle, to be with him for a month or thereabouts. While I was there, I had occa&s;ion to get up one night, or rather morning. I was obliged to pa&s;s along a gallery, and had nothing but the moon to guide my &s;teps, and &s;he was very much ob&s;cured by clouds. In going by a window which opened to the garden, I &s;aw a mon&s;trous figure, moving at a little di&s;tance from the gal|lery where I was. The moon, which ca&s;t a faint light on the mon&s;ter, gave it an appearance rather frightful. It was like a great Colo&s;&s;us, with the upper part inclining forwards. As it went away I &s;aw it by degrees dimini&s;h. All at once, however, it appeared to come in two. One half &s;eemed motionle&s;s and dead, the other greatly agi|tated; but as neither of the two approached me, in the fear that &s;eized me I had &s;trength enough to bawl out help! help! help! I had but time to utter the&s;e three words, before the living half of the phantom ran up to the gallery where I was, and in a &s;uppliant accent, &s;aid to me, ah ma&s;ter Charles, do not cry out for heaven's &s;ake. I remembered, as I thought, the voice; and therefore taking courage went up boldly to it, crying out who are you? Some hou&s;ebreaker doubtle&s;s.&mdash;No, no, ma&s;ter, I am Sam the coachman. Sam the coachman! an&s;wered I; and what are you about at &s;uch an hour as
<PB N="173" REF="185">this? I followed him, for he was now gone from me, and perceived a &s;ack of &s;omething placed again&s;t the wall. I now &s;aw clearly what had given him &s;o mon&s;trous an ap|pearance; and why he &s;eemed to come in two, when he had thrown the &s;ack off his &s;houlders. I demanded what the &s;ack had in it. I am going, an&s;wered he, betimes to town. La&s;t night I quite forgot to bring my hor&s;es their &s;upply of oats, and they mu&s;t eat before they leave the &s;table. So I ro&s;e to get it; but pray do not &s;peak a word about it in the hou&s;e, I beg you: they might think me very carele&s;s, and perhaps a thief. It came into my head, upon the &s;pot, that he might in fact be what he &s;eemed afraid of being thought. I had my&s;elf the night before, I remembered, met him with a &s;ack of oats upon his back. Be&s;ides, it was not towards the &s;table that he was going; he was very near a little door which opened at the bottom of the garden towards a lane; and be&s;ides, I thought two &s;acks of oats were more a great deal than three hor&s;es, for my uncle had but three, could want. At breakfa&s;t I in|formed my uncle of this bu&s;ine&s;s. After &s;ome examina|tion, it was found that the coachman had a fal&s;e key in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, by means of which he had at different times purloined the corn intended for the hor&s;es.</P>
<P>Now, if when the phantom had approached, and called me by my name, I had not overcome my fir&s;t fright, but run away to &s;hun him, with what terrible ideas &s;hould I have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all night? The idea of this mon&s;ter might, perhaps, have accompanied me my whole life, and rendered me a coward, if it had not touched my brain, and robbed me of my under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>In effect, this apprehen&s;ion of Mr. Fitzwilliam's was by no means groundle&s;s. I have my&s;elf been very lately told of an unhappy incident, which &s;hows how terrible the effects of fear may be on children. I will tell it you at length, my little friends, and I hope, the &s;tory will not fail to cure you of a wi&s;h to frighten one another when it is dark, if ever you give way to &s;uch a practice.</P>
<P>Charles Pomeroy, a child of great vivacity and under|&s;tanding, had adopted &s;uch a turn towards mu&s;ic, that be&s;ides his daily le&s;&s;on on the organ, which his ma&s;ter came to give him every morning, he would go at night upon a vi&s;it to his ma&s;ter, who re&s;ided in the neighbour|hood, and there repeat it.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="186">Charles's brother Augu&s;tus was a good boy likewi&s;e, but had &s;omething of a turn towards drollery; and &s;pent the time, when Charles was at his book, in &s;cheming how he might play off &s;ome trick or other, no ways mind|ing who became the object of his waggery. He took no|tice that his brother frequently came home alone, and &s;ometimes when it was dark, and turned his thoughts upon a contrivance to frighten him a little. He could walk in &s;tilts. One evening, therefore, at the time that his bro|ther was expected home, he put him&s;elf into a pair of very high ones, wrapped a great white &s;heet about him, which trailed far behind upon the ground; and took a broad brimmed hat, which fir&s;t of all he flapped, and having covered it with crape, of a &s;ufficient length to hang a great way down on every &s;ide, but mo&s;t of all before him, put it on his head. Thus frightfully equipped, he placed him&s;elf upright, and at a little di&s;tance from the hou&s;e, clo&s;e by the garden-gate, through which his bro|ther always entered coming home. This la&s;t was now re|turning in the innocent delight peculiar to a child, and humming to him&s;elf the tune that he had been playing. He was &s;carce come within a dozen paces of the gate, when he perceived the va&s;t Colo&s;&s;us, which held out its arms, advancing to attack him. Agitated with a mortal fright, at &s;uch an apparition, he fell down upon the ground, deprived of under&s;tanding. Poor Augu&s;tus, who had not fore&s;een the con&s;equences of his fatal frolic, threw away his ma&s;k immediately, and fell upon his brother's almo&s;t breathle&s;s body; and did everything in his power to reanimate him: but alas! the unhappy little fellow, as he found, was every thing but ab&s;olutely dead. His parents in&s;tantly came running to the &s;pot, and with a great deal of difficulty brought him back to life. He opened his eyes, and viewed them with a vacant &s;tupid look. They called him by every tender name; but he appeared as if he did not comprehend them. He endeavoured, but in vain, to &s;peak: his tongue e&s;&s;ayed to do &s;o, but without articulation. He is now deaf, dumb and fooli&s;h, and will very probably remain &s;o all his life-time. Six or &s;even months have pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ince this deplorable occurrence, and the doctors who attend him have, as yet, done nothing towards his cure. Imagine little friends, if you are able, the di&s;tre&s;s and &s;orrow of his parents. It would certainly
<PB N="175" REF="187">have been better, both for them and him too, had he died upon the &s;pot. They would not then have every day be|fore them &s;uch a piteous object of affliction and de&s;pair. But their di&s;tre&s;s is nothing in compari&s;on to Augu&s;tus's. Since the unhappy accident, he has been like a &s;keleton, much more than a human creature. He can neither eat nor &s;leep. His tears exhau&s;t him. Twenty times a day he walks about the room, and &s;uddenly &s;tops &s;hort: he wrings his hands, pulls up his hair, and cur&s;es even his birth. He calls and embraces his dear brother, who no longer knows him. I have &s;een them both, and cannot tell which of the two is mo&s;t unhappy.</P>

<HEAD>BACKGAMMON.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Parker had been buying, for his children, An|thony and Sylvia, what they call a draft-board, and backgammon table at the back, with thirty men, two red Morocco boxes, and a pair of dice.</P>
<P>The children did not know, as yet, both games; they were a little &s;killed in drafts; but then backgammon was all Greek or Hebrew to them; &s;o they begged their dear papa to give them &s;ome in&s;truction in it. Mr. Parker, who was always ready to make one in their diver&s;ions, undertook the ta&s;k with plea&s;ure; and by turns, &s;at down with both, while he that was not in the game, looked on for improvement.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not detain you with de&s;cribing how they reckon|ed up the pips upon the dice when they had thrown them, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their fingers; or the blunders that they were every minute making. I chu&s;e rather to inform you, that in little better than a month, they under&s;tood back|gammon tolerably well; and could &s;it down and play with one another. Sylvia bent her &s;tudy to &s;ecure the hit; but Anthony, much more ambitious, would be &s;atisfied with nothing but the gammon.</P>
<P>Their papa, one day, &s;tood by, while they were play|ing.&mdash;After &s;ome bad throws, Anthony lo&s;t all temper, and his moves of cour&s;e were very injudicious; but his
<PB N="176" REF="188">&s;i&s;ter, who was calm and &s;teady, carried every thing be|fore her.</P>
<P>Anthony, like other players, while he &s;hook the dice|box, did not fall to name the points that he wanted, either to fill up his table, or defeat his adver&s;ary. <HI>Cinq</HI> and <HI>quatre,</HI> dried ne! <HI>Size</HI> and <HI>trey!</HI> but no: they would not come; and it was always deuce and ace, or double treys, or &s;omething to the full as bad, that turned up in their &s;tead. He &s;tamped upon the ground, or when he threw the dice, was &s;o outrageous, as to fling the dice-box after, crying out, Was ever any thing &s;o cro&s;s-grained and un|lucky? one would think the matter were contrived to &s;pite me!</P>
<P>Sylvia, on the other hand, when &s;he, in throwing, called for &s;uch a number as &s;he wanted, and was di&s;ap|pointed, far from giving way to u&s;ele&s;s lamentation, thought within her&s;elf what <HI>move</HI> would be the mo&s;t judi|cious, after her bad throw; and frequently her father was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee how &s;he would make amends for want of luck, and in an in&s;tant, as it were, recover, when he thought her on the point of being wor&s;ted.</P>
<P>And whenever victory declared for her with all the ho|nours of a triumph, &s;he would con&s;tantly and mode&s;tly avoid the glory of her conque&s;t; while poor Anthony, a&s;hamed of being beaten, dur&s;t not lift his eyes up. Upon one of the&s;e occa&s;ions, when his father had been &s;tanding by, and noticed his bad playing, he addre&s;&s;ed him to the following purport: Anthony, you have richly merited to lo&s;e this game.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anthony.</SPEAKER>
<P>And not this only, but the others, I acknow|ledge, for my fault in playing with a per&s;on that is con|&s;tantly &s;o lucky.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parker.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would &s;eem then, to hear you talk, that luck is every thing, at &s;uch a game as this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anthony.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, papa; but when one has &s;uch throws as&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parker.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible that your throws &s;hould benefit you, when you played your men &s;o injudi|ciou&s;ly, and Sylvia with &s;o much attention: but you talk of having had &s;uch throws, and there your fault lies; for you paid attention to your &s;i&s;ter's dice, in&s;tead of noticing her men, that you might learn to move as &s;he did. What would be your notions of a gardener, who, without con|&s;ulting the variety of &s;ea&s;ons, &s;hould conduct him&s;elf by
<PB N="177" REF="189">chance in his plantation, and complain that in the end, his fruit was not &s;o good or plentiful as his neighbour's who had been attentive to all circum&s;tances in the pro&s;e|cution of his labour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anthony.</SPEAKER>
<P>O papa, that is very different.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parker.</SPEAKER>
<P>And in what, pray? let me know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anthony.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot well an&s;wer you in that. I think it &s;o, however.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parker.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am a&s;hamed, on your account, to &s;ee you have recour&s;e to &s;uch poor &s;hifts as little minds employ, when they re&s;olve before hand to &s;upport their cau&s;e; for tell me, have you really di&s;cerned in my compari&s;on any thing that hinders it from having a relation to the &s;ubject of which we are &s;peaking?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anthony.</SPEAKER>
<P>To &s;ay the truth then, no. I did not once think of it. I was only anxious to avoid the appearances of being wor&s;ted in the argument.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parker.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may &s;ee, then, what you get by &s;uch eva&s;ions. You were only to be blamed for wanting judg|ment; and you added in&s;tantly thereto what is much more to be condemned, a want of ju&s;tice. By u&s;ing &s;uch a pitiful &s;ubterfuge again&s;t an adver&s;ary of common &s;en&s;e, do you think that he will become its dupe, and yield you up the conque&s;t? Never. He will &s;ee the folly of it fir&s;t, and afterwards the meanne&s;s. You will find, you might have been entitled to his pity, but will meet with his con|tempt; and not <HI>his</HI> only, but your own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anthony.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, papa, I have not made you angry, that you &s;peak &s;o to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parker.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are &s;en&s;ible that I never &s;pare reproof, when I &s;ee any thing that leads, however round-about, to meanne&s;s or inju&s;tice. Such a le&s;&s;on you will get from no one but your father; and I give it you from motives of affection, that another may not have occa&s;ion to be&s;tow it on you from moro&s;ene&s;s. The confe&s;&s;ion which you fir&s;t made me, of not having once con&s;idered what you &s;poke, and which only could proceed from an ingenuous turn of mind, per&s;uades me that you will never want another le&s;&s;on of the kind.&mdash;Embrace me, my dear fellow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anthony.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh with all my heart! I know papa, you &s;ave me many mortifying minutes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parker.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can hit upon no other way of doing &s;o, than this of giving you in&s;truction; but at pre&s;ent, let us
<PB N="178" REF="190">come to the compari&s;on that I in&s;tanced; and I hope we &s;hall be no le&s;s able to derive improvement from it, than illu&s;trate what we were &s;peaking of before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anthony.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us &s;ee then, papa: I promi&s;e I will not &s;eek to contradict you: but, provided I ob&s;erve it vary in the lea&s;t from what you meant it to explain, you give me leave in that ca&s;e&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parker.</SPEAKER>
<P>I de&s;ire no gentler treatment. I &s;hall be rejoiced to have you give me ju&s;ter notions; for believe me, when I tell you, that a rational &s;elf-love finds &s;atisfaction, even in confe&s;&s;ing its mi&s;takes. Self-love, if rational, has always an unfeigned re&s;pect for truth, a veneration for re|ciprocal or mutual ju&s;tice; and that rea&s;on, which can &s;pring thus nobly from its fall, is in the way of never &s;tumbling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anthony.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah papa! I &s;ee, I mu&s;t this long while keep a tight rein on mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parker.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mu&s;t; but loo&s;en <HI>that</HI> at lea&s;t of your imagination, &s;o that you may follow while I &s;how the way. I told you, that a player at backgammon &s;hould pur&s;ue the conduct of a &s;kilful gardener in his garden. If the one endeavours to procure his tree a hand&s;ome looking trunk, and make &s;uch di&s;po&s;ition of the branches, as may get him the mo&s;t frait, the other is employed in bringing up his men in &s;uch a manner, that whatever points he throws, he may be able to fill up his tables, more or le&s;s. Tho&s;e points depend no more upon the one, than the variety of &s;ea&s;ons on the other; but what equally depends on both, is this: that they &s;hould be upon their guard, in con|&s;equence of the&s;e uncertainties, and not expo&s;e the object for which they are labouring, without precaution on their part. The order of a game has many favourable and un|favourable turns, as has the order of the &s;ea&s;ons many beneficial and malignant influences. Now the lucky chances, I may &s;ay, have a re&s;emblance to tho&s;e kindly heats which introduce fertility; and the unlucky to tho&s;e nipping winds in &s;ummer, that are ob&s;tacles to vegetation. The great point is to fore&s;ee the&s;e changes. He that plays, is with di&s;cretion to run &s;ome few ri&s;ques, when nothing need be feared from his adver&s;ary, but to &s;tand upon his guard whenever he is in force; and he that plants is to expo&s;e his tree, that it may have the beneficial influence of the &s;un, when all the elements are mixed in
<PB N="179" REF="191">kindly union; but to defend it when the weather happens to grow &s;tormy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anthony.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, papa; things hitherto &s;quare mar|vellou&s;ly well: but at backgammon, a good player, you are &s;en&s;ible, not only profits by his own dexterity, but is the better for his adver&s;ary's want of judgment, and the faults that he makes; whereas the gardener, if he plays a game, mu&s;t play it by him&s;elf in your compari&s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parker.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Anthony; but you mu&s;t not expect that a compari&s;on will take in every object and relation: mine is limited to tho&s;e I have mentioned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anthony.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think &s;o? Well then, I will proceed a little further with it, if you plea&s;e, papa. I look on all the gardeners of the village, as if playing with each other, to determine which &s;hall bring the be&s;t and greate&s;t quan|tity of fruit to market. He that plays mo&s;t &s;kilfully, will do &s;o; and of cour&s;e di&s;po&s;e of it at higher prices, if the re&s;t, through ignorance and inattention, &s;hall have le&s;s or wor&s;e to &s;ell; and con&s;equently he will win the game.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parker.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well argued, Anthony! You now &s;ee, I hope, what advantages one may derive from entering into rational debate, where neither party &s;eeks to lay a &s;nare to catch the other, and to &s;atisfy his mi&s;erable vanity, but where both wi&s;h to give reciprocal in&s;truction, by an inter|change of what they know re&s;pectively. I only &s;aw one face belonging to the object which I exhibited to your con|&s;ideration; but exciting your attention towards it, I have furni&s;hed you with the occa&s;ion of di&s;covering one that had e&s;caped me, and which very likely may enable me, in my turn, to di&s;cern &s;ome other that it may &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s. Men have obtained no &s;ort of knowledge otherwi&s;e than by a&s;|&s;embling and comparing tho&s;e ideas with which meditation has &s;upplied them, in cultivating any branch of &s;cience. I compare them to as many lamps, that &s;hould be placed to burn before reflectors of a thou&s;and different &s;urfaces, but every one reverberating to a common center. It is the bundle of the&s;e rays, &s;ome far more brilliant than the re&s;t indeed, but &s;trengthened all by one another, that makes up that glare of light collected in the focus of their union. I &s;hall really be glad, if you inure your&s;elf betimes, Anthony, to con&s;ider all the objects of which you would judge, by comparing them with others that already are familiar to your under&s;tanding; by contra&s;ing them with
<PB N="180" REF="192">one another, and remarking, in this contra&s;t, every cir|cum&s;tance by which they may re&s;emble, or be foreign to each other. This &s;ame method is mo&s;t natural and &s;ure. It is a method which <HI>they</HI> have followed, who, by exer|ci&s;ing their imagination, have attained to the &s;ublimity and pathos of a Homer, a Voltaire, a Milton; who, by &s;tudying the affections of the human heart, have made them&s;elves a Sophocles, a Moliere, or a Shake&s;peare; who, by ri&s;ing to the origin of our ideas, have become a Condillac, or Locke; who, by inve&s;tigating nature, have acquired the prai&s;es of an Ari&s;totle, a Buffon, an Edwards; who, by mecitating on the title to give law, and form <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, have been a Monte&s;quieu, a Mably, a Rou&s;&s;eau, a Black&s;tone; and in &s;hort, who by pervading the my&s;te|rious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the planetary &s;y&s;tem, have tran&s;mitted to us, together with the benefit of their re&s;earches, the illu&s;trious names of a Copernicus, a Kepler, a Bernouilli, and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; but perticularly, of a Newton: men all famous in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fferent &s;ciences to which their genius led them, and who&s;e names I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">utimate thus early to you, that in time you may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">imated with a wi&s;h of &s;tudying the immor|tal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which they have left behind them.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Should in vain endeavour to de&s;cribe the different emo|tions rai&s;ed within my &s;oul, by the peru&s;al of your let|ter. You re&s;olve that a &s;eparation &s;hall take place be|tween us. Since you judge an open rupture needful, I &s;ubmit to your good plea&s;ure. If when we were fir&s;t united, any one had told me that all our mutual vows would come to this, I &s;hould certainly not have been per|&s;uaded that &s;uch an event was po&s;&s;ible. Neverthele&s;s it has taken place. In my misfortunes however I have &s;till one con&s;olation left me; namely that in heaven there is a God, who has the means of manife&s;ting innocence. My con&s;cience clears me of reproach. My heart has no idea of an object worthier of me, as you &s;ay, than you are. It has always been devoted to you only. I pro|te&s;t all this, not making u&s;e of oaths, but by a &s;imple affirmation which my heart pronounces with a&s;&s;urance. I will make no effort to convince you of my innocence, and your inju&s;tice. I &s;hall patiently pur&s;ue the path which God's providence points out for me. God's providence, I &s;ay, which hitherto has heaped its ble&s;&s;ings on me; and, I hope, will &s;till continue &s;o to do. It is a cruel &s;tep, &s;ir, to take all my children from me. I may think, the mother who fir&s;t gave them life in angui&s;h, has a greater title to them than a father; and the laws would grant me the &s;ociety of one, at lea&s;t: but do not imagine that I have &s;uch a doubt of your paternal tenderne&s;s and wi&s;h to make them happy, as to have recour&s;e to legal aid again&s;t you. I will figure to my&s;elf with re&s;ignation, that God's will by death, has torn them from me, or that I my&s;elf am dead, and &s;hall be very quickly followed by them. Farewel, and be at all times happy, mo&s;t unju&s;t, yet deare&s;t hu&s;band. Every night and morning I will pray to God that, for your own repo&s;e, he may remove the mi&s;t of error from before

<HEAD>To Mrs. Villars.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear and Worthy FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Send you my three girls, and earne&s;tly conjure you to be&s;tow your tendere&s;t care upon them, &s;o that they may find a &s;econd mother in you. After the deplorable event that has deprived them of the mother who fir&s;t gave them life, I look upon it as a &s;pecial ble&s;&s;ing that your lady&s;hip &s;o generou&s;ly conde&s;cends to &s;uperintend their education. I am &s;en&s;ible how great a burthen I wi&s;h you to undertake, and how utterly unabled &s;hall ever be to &s;hew my gratitude for &s;uch a favour. But then what will not a father dare to do for his children? Conde&s;cend, therefore my deare&s;t Madam, upon that account, to par|don my paternal indi&s;cretion, and di&s;po&s;e for ever both of me and every thing belonging to me. There is one particular that I cannot &s;ufficiently recommend to your attention; namely, the &s;election of a proper governe&s;s. Endeavour to &s;ecure them one according to your principles and mine. There are &s;o few, Madam, fit for any thing but dre&s;&s;ing and undre&s;&s;ing dolls! and rather than deliver up my children to &s;uch creatures, I would leave them in a wilderne&s;s, to vegetate, without receiving any educati|on. But as &s;ouls that afterwards prove worthy of each other, have a &s;ort of reciprocal attraction, by a &s;ecret &s;ympathy &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in them, I am not without the hope that in &s;o elegant a place as Bath, you will at lea&s;t be able to procure &s;ome woman of a &s;uitable behaviour, with &s;en&s;e &s;ufficient, and knowledge to bring up my children as I wi&s;h. I beg that you would &s;uppo&s;e your&s;elf at liber|ty to enter into any terms with &s;uch a one as you your&s;elf think proper, &s;ince I mean to &s;pare no co&s;t upon a point of &s;uch importance. I am quite impatient for a letter from you. It would highly plea&s;e me, if your lady&s;hip would charge my elde&s;t daughter Harriet with &s;ome part of the corre&s;pondence that will be between us; as by &s;uch means, &s;he will come her&s;elf to write correctly betimes, and to expre&s;s her&s;elf with &s;ome degree of ea&s;e. It is in
<PB N="193" REF="205">your power to render more &s;upportable the great misfortune that I have undergone, and to give me in my children all the joy of which their mother has deprived me. In reality, I cheri&s;h &s;uch a hope within me, to drive out the unea&s;ine&s;s that otherwi&s;e would overwhelm me; and &s;ub|&s;cribe my&s;elf, with every &s;entiment of gratitude, e&s;teem and friend&s;hip,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear papa,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE &s;o many things to write to you, that I cannot tell with which I &s;hould begin my letter. We are now no longer at Mrs. Villars's, but have removed to Mrs. Lam|bert,
<PB N="201" REF="213">our governe&s;s's hou&s;e; it is in the Circus, and a very plea&s;ant &s;ituation. You cannot po&s;&s;ibly conceive how happy we are all of us in being with her. She is &s;uch a charming woman! quite as kind as our mama! She loves us ju&s;t as if we were her children, and we love her al&s;o ju&s;t as if &s;he were our mother! There is no need of laying out your money to have ma&s;ters come and teach us; &s;he her&s;elf knows every thing that we ought to learn. You would imagine that &s;he con&s;idered it her happine&s;s to teach us; and &s;he does it in &s;o kind a way, that we are all delighted with in&s;truction at her hands. Sophia and little Caroline already read quite charmingly, &s;o much attention Mrs. Lambert has paid them! As for me, I have begun a cour&s;e of geography and hi&s;tory with her: this, together with a little cyphering, and a few choice pieces both in ver&s;e and pro&s;e, which I take care to learn by heart, employs our morning. In the afternoon, for recreation &s;ake, I go to drawing, dancing, and the harp|&s;icord; and when the evening comes, &s;it down and take my needle, at the u&s;e of which you cannot imagine how clever Mrs. Lambert is: and la&s;tly, to complete my&s;elf in cyphering, and acquire a little knowledge of the expences of a hou&s;e, &s;he gives me all the bills to overlook, and makes me &s;et down every little &s;um of money that &s;he lays out. By the&s;e means I begin to know the price of many things, and, as &s;he tells me, may become your little &s;tewarde&s;s when I return. With &s;o much on my hands to do all day, you will perhaps, imagine that I am tired at night; not at all, papa. I am happy, on the contrary, to think that I have &s;o well filled up my time, and &s;hould have rea&s;on to complain, if any one deprived me of &s;uch charming occupations.</P>
<P>I have put a little trick on Mrs. Lambert, and mean to tell you what it is. She went the other day with Caro|line to vi&s;it Mrs. Villars, and left me at home to keep Sophia company. I thought it would divert her if I read a little; &s;o I took a book that we have, called the Theatre of Education, from the French, and read the <HI>Poor Blind Woman.</HI> I could not refrain from crying very much; but, to my great &s;urpri&s;e, Sophia did not. This quite vexed me, as you may ea&s;ily imagine; upon which I pinched her, that &s;he might cry and keep me company. She cried indeed, and more a great deal than I wanted
<PB N="202" REF="214">her to do. At la&s;t however I appea&s;ed her, after many ki&s;&s;es and care&s;&s;es, but was angry with my&s;elf for having hurt her. I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;ome object took off her attention while I read, and naturally thought that &s;he would be really affected, could &s;he read the piece her&s;elf: with this idea in my head, I formed a plan of putting her to con this charming piece in private, till &s;he could read it per|fectly; and Mrs. Lambert could not refrain la&s;t night from wondering at the progre&s;s that &s;he had made. We did not let her know our &s;ecret, but propo&s;e to catch her &s;o again with Caroline. I am quite rejoiced that we can have the&s;e opportunities of plea&s;ing her, for all the trouble that &s;he is every moment taking upon our account.</P>
<P>The&s;e, dear papa, are our amu&s;ements and our &s;tudies here; to which if you add our walks about the place, our vi&s;its to a few poor people near us, whom we now and then a&s;&s;i&s;t with old clothes and money, and our labours in a little garden, where we tend our flowers, you will have the hi&s;tory of our times at large. We never were &s;o well in health as now, and never in our lives &s;o happy; we want nothing but the plea&s;ure of your company. If you would only take a little journey down to Bath, I would give every thing in the world that you might &s;ee this Mrs. Lambert. I am &s;ure, no woman breathing would prove worthier of your friend&s;hip. Oh! come, come papa!</P>
<P>But you mu&s;t know, I have Caroline at pre&s;ent at my elbow, and &s;he a&s;ks me if I am writing to you. She is &s;o proud of having &s;crawled the&s;e few days pa&s;t what &s;he calls letters, in a copy-book that Mrs. Lambert has made her, that &s;he &s;ays &s;he too will &s;cribble you a line or two. It will be a charming hodge-podge, I fore&s;ee, of great and little letters, and fine &s;pelling, if &s;he &s;ets about it; but no matter, I mu&s;t plea&s;e her. She has got a pen, in hand already, and is groping in the &s;tandi&s;h for ink. She is tugging me this very moment by the apron to leave off, and give her up my &s;eat. Adieu then, dear papa. My governe&s;s de&s;ires me to pre&s;ent you her re&s;pects. Sophia's duty to you, and mine al&s;o. I am, &amp;c.</P>

<PB N="204" REF="216">madam, I have &s;hewn my&s;elf the mo&s;t unju&s;t and cruel of all hu&s;bands! I have dared to di&s;parage the un&s;potted virtue of my Amelia with my &s;candalous &s;u&s;picions; of my Amelia, I repeat, who&s;e very looks I am unworthy now to meet. It was when I mo&s;t in&s;ulted her that &s;he was mo&s;t &s;tudious to pre&s;erve my name from ignominy. One of my relations, a young man whom I patronized, was on the point of being utterly di&s;graced among his brother officers, for certain youthful levities which he dur&s;t not communi|cate to me, acquainted as he was with my impatient tem|per. It was &s;he who, with the fruits of her oeconomy, delivered him from the di&s;honour that he was going to bring both upon him&s;elf and me. She had &s;ufficient &s;trength of mind to bear with my unworthy treatment and a&s;per&s;ions, rather than expo&s;e him to my indignation by revealing his delinquency. I have di&s;covered very re|cently this motive for tho&s;e &s;ecret interviews that &s;o di&s;|turbed my mind, and cannot keep from cur&s;ing my dete&s;ted jealou&s;y. But how &s;hall I endure her pre&s;ence? At her feet, and without daring to look up, I will implore her pardon. I am po&s;ting to that quarter where &s;he has fixed her retirement: fortunately I mu&s;t pa&s;s through Bath to reach it. I &s;hall &s;ee you by the way, and ki&s;s my almo&s;t orphan little ones.

<P>INSTEAD of &s;eeing me, or any of the children, you will have a letter full of tears and lamentation. On the day after your departure, Harriet and Sophia all at once complained of being feveri&s;h, and were attacked with &s;uch a head-ache that they could not po&s;&s;ibly keep up. We put them, therefore, in&s;tantly to bed. Towards evening, Caroline made ju&s;t the &s;ame complaint. All three are now covered quite over with a very thick &s;mall-pox of &s;uch a &s;ort as I am told is very virulent. I mu&s;t forget that I never had this dreadful malady my&s;elf. All night, as well as day, I keep my &s;ituation by their bed, and every moment fear they will be &s;uffocated. I have felt already, in my&s;elf, a la&s;&s;itude and heat in every limb; but my affection makes me &s;tranger than I &s;hould be otherwi&s;e. Their love and tenderne&s;s &s;u&s;tain my courage. I perceive that, in the height of all their &s;ufferings, they refrain, as much as they are able, from complaint, for fear of giving me unea&s;ine&s;s. In the delirium of their fever, they do nothing but pronounce your name and mine, with tones of voice &s;o moving, that one cannot po&s;&s;ibly expre&s;s them; and no earlier than this very morning, Caroline de&s;ired to &s;ee you. I replied that I could not &s;end to London for you, le&s;t you &s;hould catch her illne&s;s. "Oh, no, no, mama, &s;aid &s;he, do not be afraid; I'll keep it all my&s;elf!" &mdash;"My child, replied I upon this, you might communi|cate the infection to him, without lo&s;ing it your&s;elf."&mdash; "So much the wor&s;e," &s;aid Caroline, and &s;wooned away with weakne&s;s; but &s;oon after, coming to her&s;elf, &s;he called me, &s;aying, "Dear mama, you have the picture of papa about your neck; pray let me ki&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">!

Harriet is afraid le&s;t my letter &s;hould afflict you, and reque&s;ts, with tears, that I would permit her writing &s;omething to con&s;ole you. I am fearful &s;uch an effort may exhau&s;t her, but more fearful to afflict her by my refu&s;al; I am, therefore, giving her my letter, and her trembling hand writes this:

<P>She cannot write another word. I find my &s;trength &s;or|&s;ake me too. I am &s;eized all over with a mortal pain. I hear Sophia groan, and mu&s;t go to her &s;uccour.

<P>YOU would never gue&s;s what has lately happened to my brother, to that upright and re&s;pected Daniel, who&s;e good heart and prudent conduct made all his friends that were &s;o happy as to be of his acquaintance! You remember, I &s;uppo&s;e, the pur&s;e that mama pre&s;ented him when you were by, with three new guineas in it. Well, tho&s;e three new guineas with the pur&s;e are gone, and to increa&s;e your wonder, the poor boy will not or cannot tell which way. As it is &s;uppo&s;ed that he makes a &s;ecret of it from a principle of ob&s;tinacy, he was &s;hut up in a little room this morning, where he is not to be vi&s;rted by any one, and whence he mu&s;t not hope to be delivered but by making known the whole affair. How &s;incerely I lament him, &s;uffering this &s;everity of puni&s;hment! He has never been hitherto con&s;idered of an ob&s;tinate or head&s;trong di&s;|po&s;ition. On the contrary, he has been always com|mended for his docility and frankne&s;s. I would willingly have pleaded in his favour, but could not obtain a hear|ing. Neverthele&s;s, I am very &s;ure, he has not to reproach him&s;elf with any crime or meanne&s;s. Come this afternoon and &s;ee me, if you have your liberty.

<P>I CANNOT but confe&s;s that I entertain &s;ome pity for your <HI>upright</HI> and <HI>re&s;pected</HI> Daniel; but &s;o little, that he need not greatly tax his grateful nature to repay me.

Whenever I have been cen&s;uring other people's imper&s;ec|tions in their ab&s;ence, for the in&s;truction of my friends, to hear his manner of defending them, one would imagine I were only venting &s;lander. Well, at pre&s;ent then, my little judge him&s;elf is under condemnation; and indeed he mu&s;t be highly guilty, &s;ince his very parents have for|gotten all the &s;illy fondne&s;s that they had for him. I am charmed that they have come to know him at la&s;t; and would lay a wager that he de&s;erves much greater puni&s;h|ment than he receives. Ob&s;tinacy is a very frightful vice alone; but in addition, he is an awkward &s;pendthrift. All the money that he can fi&s;h out of his father, he di&s;|per&s;es fooli&s;hly among a tribe of ragamu&s;&s;ins, and has never had the &s;pirit to employ it in a manner honourable to him&s;elf. If he had &s;pent tho&s;e guineas in &s;ilk &s;tock|ings, fa&s;hionable buckles, or the like, one might excu&s;e him. Did I &s;ay excu&s;e him? one might certainly applaud his judgment in that ca&s;e. However, as I &s;aid before, I pity him a little, being, as he is, your brother; but Do|rothea, you I pity mo&s;t &s;incerely, being, as you are, his &s;i&s;ter. I cannot po&s;&s;ibly wait upon you this evening, it is &s;uch charming weather for a walk: and then I have the prettie&s;t dre&s;s that ever you &s;aw ju&s;t come home, which I mu&s;t certainly put on.

However, I mu&s;t tell you, his affairs take now a very gloomy turn, at lea&s;t to all appearances. One of our &s;ervants has made a di&s;covery of the pur&s;e at a confec|tioner's hard by.

It is no way pro|bable that my brother &s;hould have laid out three guineas on &s;weetmeats, when he deprives him&s;elf of every thing by indulging his extreme genero&s;ity.

<P>I AM no le&s;s at my ea&s;e than you, upon account of Daniel, and as much per&s;uaded that this affair will turn out to his advantage. He has learnt, I make no doubt, already in his &s;olitude, that he him&s;elf is far from being quite exempt from &s;uch defects as he has frequently a&s;cribed to me; and the &s;evere correction which he will certainly receive, will be revenge enough for me. On the&s;e con&s;iderations, I am entirely at my ea&s;e on his ac|count, becau&s;e by this means the affair will end to his advantage. It is indeed quite nece&s;&s;ary to his growing perfection, that on this occa&s;ion he &s;hould undergo the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hment. How, my &s;anctimonious Mr. Da|niel! you would per&s;uade your parents that you give every thing away in charity, and fi&s;h thus cunningly for money, which you afterwards lay out, three guineas at a time, in &s;weetmeats! Truly, I do not wonder that he &s;hould be &s;o backward in revealing the affair. It would be very ho|nourable to him. Ob&s;tinate! a cheat! and a glutton! three good qualities indeed, and all at once di&s;coverable in him! Mighty &s;ine! He calls the hands of a confectioner, good hands, becau&s;e, as I &s;uppo&s;e, they make good things. There is charming logic for you! But adieu, my dear Dorothea!

<P>I TAKE the earlie&s;t opportunity in my power to &s;atis&s;y your generous curio&s;ity. My hero's grand adventure now is terminated in a way that gives &s;atisfaction to every body &mdash;every body indeed, except the wicked. And this la&s;t circum&s;tance magnifies the plea&s;ure that I enjoy from this communication.</P>
<P>Here now follow the particulars of the affair at length. &mdash;My brother late la&s;t night was franding at the door, and &s;aw a poor old man go by him, followed by three children that were crying bitterly. He &s;upped them, and enquired the readen of their &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s. The old man was &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a&s;hamed, he could not an&s;wer; but the elde&s;t of the children told him, notwith&s;tanding frequent interruptions cau&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bing, that they had not had a bit of any thing that day. "Alas! my little ma&s;ter," added he, "we are greatly to be pitied. We had formerly, as you have, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e hou&s;e: but now are left without a &s;hed to cover us. Our parents are both dead of broken hearts, and we have no friend to help us but our grandfather, and he is far too old and weak to work for our &s;upport." The poor old man, while this was &s;aying, hid his face and &s;ighed mo&s;t lamentably. Daniel, who it &s;eems was very much affected at the &s;cene before him, had not time to take advice, but ran up &s;tairs immediately to fetch his pur&s;e, and gave it to the poor old man. He wept afre&s;h with joy and admiration at my little brother's genero&s;ity, but would not take the money. Daniel fell into a pa&s;&s;ion &s;eeing this, and nothing but the old man's acquie&s;cence in the gift could calm him. He did accept the pur&s;e; but, as he judged the charity that he had received to be too con&s;iderable for a child like my brother to be&s;tow, he re&s;olved to bring it back next day. He went with &s;uch a view to leave it at the &s;hop of the confectioner, and a&s;ked to have a &s;hilling only to provide his little family a &s;upper. I cannot tell you how he made the money up again, but not a quarter of an hour ago, and ju&s;t before my father
<PB N="215" REF="227">could &s;et out to &s;peak with the confectioner, he brought the pur&s;e with all the money in it to our hou&s;e. I could have wi&s;hed, mi&s;s, that you had been pre&s;ent at this &s;cene; you would then have been taught to entertain a different notion of my brother's generous heart. His noble &s;acrifice, together with the old man's hone&s;t &s;cru|ples, made us all &s;hed tears. The children and him&s;elf have had as much as twice the value of the pur&s;e, and Daniel too has been paid for what he did, with &s;i&s;ty prayers and ble&s;&s;ings. The concealment of this bounteous action, which my brother thought was nothing but his duty, puts a greater value on it in the eyes of my papa, and merits at my hand a mea&s;ure of additional affection.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>From George Wallace to Catharine.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Catharine,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have di&s;mal news to tell you! Our good old friend Lawrence is no more. You recollect, he had been out of order ever &s;ince la&s;t autumn. For a fortnight pa&s;t he had not left his room. La&s;t Monday evening, when I came from &s;chool, they told me that he had died that afternoon. I could not, I a&s;&s;ure you, refrain from crying bitterly. His long indi&s;po&s;ition had before-hand rendered him much dearer to me. I employed the time that I had to &s;pare from &s;chool, in doing him whatever &s;ervice I was able. After all, alas! I owed him more than I had time and means to pay. He was our friend, and, I may add too, benefactor from the cradle. In our earlie&s;t childhood,
<PB N="216" REF="228">we lived more a great deal in his arms, than on our feet. He was never out of temper, but always kind and chear|ful. How delighted was he, when he had it in his power to afford us any new plea&s;ure, or to di&s;gui&s;e an old one &s;o that we might think it new! I verily believe, that all his pain in dying was, that death prevented him from being any longer u&s;eful to us. He had been of older &s;tanding in the family than our papa; and though he was no better than a common &s;ervant, every body looked upon him with a &s;ort of veneration. During his la&s;t illne&s;s, no one paid a vi&s;it here without enquiring; "and how fares the good old Lawrence?" I could &s;ee that the que&s;tion was agreeable to my papa, who always looked on Lawrence as a very faithful friend. If &s;o, no wonder then that he &s;upported him in his old age, and gave him every &s;ort of comfort that he could require. A gentleman could not have been more comfortably &s;ituated, or more attentively treated. La&s;t night, when he was buried, I de&s;ired papa's permi&s;&s;ion to be pre&s;ent at the ceremony. He could not, without &s;ome difficulty, grant me &s;uch a favoar, le&s;t it might have a bad effect upon me: but he &s;aw that I &s;hould have &s;uffered more from being ab&s;ent. I accompanied the body therefore, holding up a corner of the pall. I thought that by this office we were &s;till attached to one another, and that really in &s;ome &s;ort I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him &s;till. When I was forced to quit my hold, my hand was ju&s;t as if it had been numbed, and did not open without difficulty; but if this was mournful, it was much more melancholy when they let him down into the grave, and e&s;pecially when they filled it up. I could not take my eyes off from the &s;pot. Till then I could not be per&s;uaded that Death had wholly &s;eparated us. As long as I could &s;ee his coffin, there remained &s;till &s;omething of him; but when this re|mainder di&s;appeared, then I felt that I had for ever lo&s;t him. All night long I &s;aw him in my dreams: his gho&s;t by no means frightened me: it &s;eemed to &s;mile upon me, and I ru&s;hed into its arms. I pa&s;&s;ed this morning in my chamber all alone, and was employed in writing you this letter. I de&s;igned to &s;end you but a line or two, whereas my &s;ubject has extended while I &s;poke of Lawrence.&mdash;Our good friend is come to &s;ee me; Mr. Hutton, that vene|rable worthy man, who takes &s;o much delight in giving people plea&s;ure when he cannot do them good; and he
<PB N="217" REF="229">has left me an exceedingly pathetic &s;tory of a &s;ervant wo|man who worked hard to &s;upport her mi&s;tre&s;s after &s;he was fallen into poverty. Indeed I found it &s;o exceedingly pathetic, that I &s;et immediately about tran&s;cribing it, and &s;end you a fair copy, &s;ince the reading of it may be a &s;olace to you, as it was to me. At every act of friend&s;hip that El&s;py performed, I cried out, This Lawrence would have done for us, had we been in the &s;ituation of the lady. Ah, poor Lawrence! Ah, my good friend Lawrence!&mdash; Fare you well, dear &s;i&s;ter! I mu&s;t here conclude my letter being &s;ent for down by my papa to entertain him, gloomy as I am my&s;elf.

<HEAD>ELSPY CAMPBELL.</HEAD>
<HEAD>(This piece was inclo&s;ed in the preceding letter.)</HEAD>
<P>MRS. Macdowell, a widow lady, of an ancient and re&s;pectable family in Scotland, after having enjoyed the advantages of fortune till the age of fifty years, &s;aw her&s;elf all at once &s;uddenly deprived of them, and reduced to the mo&s;t helple&s;s indigence. She never had been ble&s;&s;ed with any children, who might now &s;upport her by the labour of their indu&s;try; and every other individual of the family was equally involved in her misfortunes. Wan|dering in the Highlands, &s;he was all day long &s;oliciting a &s;helter for the night, and a mor&s;el of bread for her &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>El&s;py Campbell, who had been her faithful &s;ervant many years, and was always treated very kindly by her ancient mi&s;tre&s;s, learns the&s;e di&s;mal tidings in her humble cottage, whither &s;he was now retired to pa&s;s the remnant
<PB N="218" REF="230">of her days, far di&s;tant from her former &s;ervice. She immediately &s;ets out in &s;earch of her re&s;pectable mi&s;tre&s;s. There was a line marked our by her misfortunes, and the grateful El&s;py had but to walk in it. After much labo|rious travel, &s;he at la&s;t found the mournful object of her journey, and falling down on the ground before her, began thus: "Oh, my dear good mi&s;tre&s;s! though I am hardly younger than your&s;elf, I am, notwith&s;tanding that, much &s;tronger and more capable of working. You, on the contrary, are far too feeble to go through with any thing like labour, on account of your former way of life, your troubles, and the &s;everal infirmities that are come all at once upon you. Come and take up your abode with me. I have a little cottage: it is well &s;ituated, and keeps out the weather. In addition to my cottage, I have a garden al&s;o, which produces me more potatoes than both of us can con&s;ume. When I have tried all methods to &s;upport you if I can, or rather when God's providence has once whatever he thinks proper to &s;upport us both, you &s;hall be free to quit me, if you find an inn with better entertainment: or &s;tay with me, if you &s;hould not find one. Be of courage, my dear mi&s;tre&s;s! I was always <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">out and hearty in your &s;ervice, and thank God I am &s;till the &s;ame. I will find you food, if any will but &s;how it|&s;elf, when I have &s;own my little bit of ground; and if it will not &s;how it&s;elf, in that ca&s;e I will dig down till I rind it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">"</P>
<P>"O my generous El&s;py!" &s;aid the afflicted widow, "I re&s;ign my&s;elf entirely to your friend&s;hip. I will live and die with one of &s;o much gratitude; for I am &s;ure, God's ble&s;&s;ing will be always with you."&mdash;They &s;et out immediated, for El&s;py's dwelling. The cottage was in|deed extremely little, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a healthful &s;ituation: cleanline&s;s and order were the only decorations that it could boa&s;t. There was a hole on one &s;ide in the wall, through which a little light proceeded, when the wind was not that way: but when it would have incommoded her, the hole was &s;topped completely by a &s;od with ro&s;e leaves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eat into it, and poor bl&s;py was obliged to be con|tented with the little light that reached her down the chimney. Elpy's bed, which was invi&s;ible when people entered, was defended from the cold that would have reached it through the door-way, by a bank of earth. It
<PB N="219" REF="231">had a mattre&s;s &s;tuft with &s;traw, good &s;heets, a pair of blankets, and coar&s;e woollen rug. It had not curtains; but when El&s;py found that &s;he was in future to be ho|noured with the friend&s;hip and &s;ociety of &s;o re&s;pectable a gue&s;t, &s;he bethought her&s;elf to hang the walls about it with a bulru&s;h lining, which was warmer than the &s;ilkie&s;t dama&s;k. In this bed &s;lept Mrs. Macdowell, with her feet both placed again&s;t poor El&s;py's bo&s;om, who was u&s;ed to bend her&s;elf almo&s;t double, round the widow's legs, that &s;he might keep them warm. She never would con&s;ent to lie be&s;ide her mi&s;tre&s;s; but the more &s;he &s;aw her fallen from her former &s;plendour, &s;till the more obe|dience and re&s;pect &s;he &s;howed her, to wipe out by that means all idea of the change &s;he had experienced in her fortune. An old Bible, Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe, and a few odd volumes of devotion and morality, which once had co|vers, furni&s;hed ample matter for their evening's conver&s;a|tions. With re&s;pect to their repa&s;ts, they frequently had eggs, at all times milk, and were never without potatoes. The be&s;t baked potatoes, fie&s;he&s;t eggs, and large&s;t bowl of milk, were con&s;tantly placed before Mrs. Macdowell.</P>
<P>It will doubtle&s;s be a matter of &s;ome curio&s;ity to know how El&s;py could keep up the honours of her cot in &s;uch a &s;tate of oeconomical abundance. To do this, &s;he had her &s;pinning-wheel in winter, and her labours of the field <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n harve&s;t. It mu&s;t notwith&s;tanding be acknowledged that &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a manife&s;t advantage over every younger woman, not &s;o much for any natural activity, as for an obtu&s;e angle in her line of bodily direction, &s;o that both her hands and eyes were nearer by a great deal to the ground than otherwi&s;e they would have been, and readier for her &s;pinning-wheel. Be&s;ides, when things were rai&s;ed in price above her means to purcha&s;e them, &s;he had but to go out and beg a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the neighbouring towns and villages. For this &s;he had contrived a tolerable efficacious method. She would go among the riche&s;t farmers only, and when got before their door, &s;tand &s;till, and lifting up her hands to heaven, cry out, "I come to a&s;k your cha|rity, by no means for my&s;elf, for I can live on any thing, but for my mi&s;tre&s;s, a lady of noble blood, daughter of Lord James, and grandchild of Lord Archibald."&mdash;If the farmers gave her any thing, or what &s;ufficed her rea&s;onable expectations, &s;he would add, "May the Almighty's ble&s;|&s;ing,
<PB N="220" REF="232">with my mi&s;tre&s;s's, and El&s;py Campbell's, come upon this hou&s;e and its inhabitants!"&mdash;It is ea&s;y to ima|gine what &s;ucce&s;s this ble&s;&s;ing, and the expectation of a different &s;alutation from the lips of El&s;py, had &s;he been refu&s;ed, produced from people naturally ho&s;pitable, and exceedingly attached to their nobility. She obtained by this method, victuals, cloaths, and very often money which &s;he carefully put up to buy her mi&s;tre&s;s &s;hoes and &s;tock|ings; and the&s;e, when half worn out, &s;erved afterwards for her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Thus they lived, both happy; one in her exertions, and the other in her gratitude. The generous El&s;py was extremely rigorous on the &s;ubject of her duty. Mrs. Mac|dowell was a gentlewoman, and though &s;upported by El&s;py, was not to forego the privileges of nobility; that is to &s;ay, &s;he was not to do any thing like work, no not &s;o much as wa&s;h her feet her&s;elf. One day, as El&s;py was employed in carrying out a ba&s;ket full of dung to lay on her potatoe beds, her mi&s;tre&s;s had come out to get a pitcher full of water, and was now returning with it to the cot|tage. El&s;py &s;aw her, put the ba&s;ket down, and running to her, took away the pitcher, emptied it, and fetched her other water. When &s;he brought it in, &s;he &s;aid with much re&s;pect, "Pardon me, madam! but you that are daughter of Lord James, and grandchild to Lord Archi|bald, never &s;hall demean your&s;elf by carrying water while I live, and have my limbs to do it for you."</P>
<P>The report of &s;o much genero&s;ity in one &s;o indigent, at la&s;t reached me who am the writer of this &s;tory, and I &s;ent her, every quarter, &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance as my fortune would allow. As long as El&s;py lived, which was upwards of &s;ix years from the time of my fir&s;t learning the&s;e particulars, whenever I &s;at down to dine or &s;up in company, and was required to give my toa&s;t, it was always El&s;py Campbell. My attachment to this name generally made the company eager to know &s;omething of the lady who engro&s;&s;ed &s;o great a &s;hare of my affection. They would con&s;equently a&s;k me, begging pardon for their freedom; when I told them, El&s;py Campbe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was an ancient beggar woman.&mdash; "What!" they would cry out, "a beggar!"&mdash;"Yes, but hear the re&s;t;" and then would follow the whole &s;tory, &s;uch in &s;ub&s;tance as I have already told it. Hardly ever could I fini&s;h, but half-crowns and half-guineas rained
<PB N="221" REF="233">into my hat for El&s;py. The&s;e &s;mall &s;ums, which I was &s;ure to &s;end her pretty often, once occa&s;ioned her to a&s;k my &s;ervant, "Who is it that &s;ends you? Doubtle&s;s, he is a friend of God. He does me good as God does, though I never &s;ee him."</P>
<P>Mrs. Macdowell died, and El&s;py very quickly after, through affliction for the lo&s;s of her good mi&s;tre&s;s. She remembered nothing but the bounty of her former bene|factre&s;s; what her gratitude had done in con&s;equence of that remembrance &s;he forgot.</P>
<P>The generous, the heroic &s;ervility of El&s;py was not, as it might have been, a &s;park of gratitude that crackled for a moment and went out: it was an ardent flame that blazed for twenty years, till death &s;uppre&s;&s;ed it for a &s;ea&s;on in the grave where &s;he was laid to re&s;t; for it is not utterly put out, &s;ince from her a&s;hes it will certainly bur&s;t forth again, with renovated brightne&s;s, on the morning of that day that never is to fini&s;h.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>From Catharine Wallace to George her brother.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Deare&s;t Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT &s;orrowful tidings your letter brings me! Am I never more to &s;ee my dear friend Lawrence? Poor good man! he &s;eemed to apprehend as much him|&s;elf, the day that I left you to come here. "It is very likely, dear Mi&s;s Kitty," &s;aid he, "you will never &s;ee me more, and therefore think of me at lea&s;t." Alas! I have been thinking of him, and concluded how it would plea&s;e him when he found that I had, on my return. I thought to knit him a &s;tout pair of &s;tockings for next winter's wear, and was at work upon them at the very moment that I received your letter, with intelligence that he was dead. The work fell from me. After I had picked it up, I &s;hed a &s;tood of tears. "They are not then for him," I cried. "Oh! yes, they &s;hall be; for I will fini&s;h both, and put them in my drawers, that they may daily be a token of remembrance for him."&mdash;You do not tell
<PB N="222" REF="234">me in your letter if he often &s;poke about me. I am &s;ure he did, but that you feared to aggravate my grief by &s;ay|ing &s;o. I am greatly grieved that I was not pre&s;ent to attend upon him in his &s;ickne&s;s, as I verily believe that the plea&s;ure of our &s;ervices would have prolonged his days. I think, you acted very properly in going to his burial. I acknowledge, had I been at home, I &s;hould not have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a heart to do &s;o; but am therefore more affected at your &s;trength of mind and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>In the &s;orrow cau&s;ed me by your letter, it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to read the hi&s;tory of El&s;py Campbell without &s;hedding tears. I thank you for it, and am thoroughly convinced, as you are, that our friend Lawrence would have done the &s;ame for us, had we been in the place of Mrs. Macdowell. I imagine it is the fault of ma&s;ters, if the major part of &s;ervants are not Lawrences and El&s;pies. They addre&s;s them frequently &s;o roughly, how can they &s;uppo&s;e their &s;ervants &s;hould do any thing but fear them? Since by accidental circum&s;tances they are placed in an inferior rank, is it humanity to tread them under foot? or rather, is it not our duty to afford &s;uch tokens of affec|tion as may rai&s;e them in their own e&s;teem, and gain us their attachment? People &s;eek to make them&s;elves re|&s;pected by their countrymen and neighbours: why not then do more, and &s;eek to be re&s;pected in their families, by tho&s;e who are pre&s;ent with them every moment of the day? Why not look upon them as a &s;econd cla&s;s of chil|dren? Are there even many ma&s;ters who would do, to benefit the deare&s;t friend they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, what the generous El&s;py did in favour of her mi&s;tre&s;s?&mdash;When my uncle had peru&s;ed your letter, he informed me that a &s;o|ciety of gentlemen in France had very lately recompen&s;ed a conduct ju&s;t like El&s;py's. I am glad to hear that it meets with imitation. It mu&s;t certainly &s;hew ma&s;ters the nece&s;&s;ity of being kind and courteous to their &s;ervants, &s;ince it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them that, in &s;pite of pre&s;ent fortune, they may come to want their &s;uccour one day or another; nor can &s;ervants hear of &s;uch a conduct, and not feel a &s;pecies of encouragement to &s;erve their ma&s;ters with fidelity and diligence. I think, if ever we keep hou&s;e, we &s;hall be able, like papa, to fill it with &s;uch people as will &s;erve us with their hearts no le&s;s than with their hands.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="235">This week has been a very &s;ad one for your poor &s;i&s;ter. Ye&s;terday my uncle took me out a walking with him in the country, to divert my &s;orrow. Suddenly we heard a drum &s;trike up: we ha&s;tened to the &s;pot. It was for &s;e|veral new recruits that had been levied and were going then to join their regiments. There were mixed among the &s;oldiers many country-women who no doubt had chil|dren, if not hu&s;bands too, among&s;t the party; for they did nothing but embrace and ki&s;s each other, and &s;hed tears. When we had looked a little at this multitude, a woman dre&s;&s;ed in mourning, of a very decent and re&s;pect|able appearance, drew our ob&s;ervation. She was taking leave of a young man who bit his lips to keep from crying. She gave him a bottle, which my uncle &s;aid was brandy, and a little piece of canvas that had &s;omething wrapped up in it. He accepted one, but would not take the other, though &s;he pre&s;&s;ed him very earne&s;tly. My uncle upon this drew near, and &s;aid, Is that your &s;on there, my good woman? Yes, &s;ays &s;he, my only &s;on, &s;ir, and the would has not a better. My poor hu&s;band died ten months ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and left me with three little girls be&s;ides, the elde&s;t not quite five years old. Our la&s;t bad harve&s;t made him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> five pounds in debt. When he was dead, the creditors came on me, and I thought would take away my little field which is all that we have for our &s;upport. This re|cruiting party then were with us, and a wealthy farmer's &s;on had &s;ome how or another been drawn in to enli&s;t. He made it known about the country, that if any one would take his place, he &s;hould receive four pounds. My &s;on applied, and &s;aid, that for five guineas he would be his man, which was at la&s;t agreed to. Of this I did not know a word until every thing was &s;ettled; otherwi&s;e I &s;hould have begged my &s;on to leave his &s;i&s;ters and my&s;elf to want a little for the pre&s;ent, rather than deprive me of his help, he being every thing imaginable to us, and the only friend that we have. I thought I &s;hould have &s;wooned when he pre&s;ented me the guineas which he had ju&s;t received for enli&s;ting. I applied to the recruiting &s;er|jeant to break off the bargain, but he would not lend an ear to any thing that I &s;aid. My &s;on endeavoured to con&s;ole me every way in his power, by &s;aying that my little field was now &s;et free, and therefore would pre|&s;erve the children and my&s;elf from real want. Be comfort|ed,
<PB N="224" REF="236">&s;aid he; I &s;hall be quartered in the neighbourhood a little longer, &s;o that every evening, when our exerci&s;e is over, I can come and work a little for you; and at wor&s;t my time of &s;ervice is not longer than three years, and I &s;hall then have my di&s;charge.&mdash;Alas! cried &s;he, when every thing was going on &s;o well, I did not doubt of being able &s;oon to pay my debts; and he mu&s;t leave me now! Perhaps the war will come again, and I &s;hall never &s;ee him more.</P>
<P>My uncle a&s;ked her what it was that &s;he would have given him in the piece of canvas. She replied, it was a guinea which had been paid her, not a week before, by a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ady for the weaning of her child. It was all the money, added &s;he, that I have on earth, and I de&s;igned to keep it for &s;ome great emergency. I only wi&s;h that he would have taken it, but &s;hould have known him better. He would never rob me, as he &s;aid, no, not accept of any thing, when he had all day long been labouring for me; on the contrary, he u&s;ed to give me what he earned among the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for his work. My uncle took down her direction, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to do whatever he was able for her. She ap|peared extremely &s;en&s;ible of &s;uch a kindne&s;s, and her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> lity affected me as much, for twenty times I was in tears while &s;he &s;tood uttering her complaint; and yet I think, that I pitied the poor young man &s;till much more. It was very ea&s;y to di&s;cern the violence that he did him|&s;elf, to hide his &s;orrow from his mother and companions, notwith&s;tanding there was nothing in that &s;orrow that he had any need to blu&s;h at. His poor mother wi&s;hed to go a little further with him; but, as &s;oon as ever the drum &s;truck up, &s;he fell into a &s;woon. We brought her home, and tried all methods to con&s;ole her: I, by gentle language, and my uncle by promi&s;es of kind|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Hear me, my good brother, while I tell you an idea that has ju&s;t now &s;truck me. From the lo&s;s of Lawrence, we can tell how wretched they mu&s;t be who are divided from the object of their love. The mother &s;uffers &s;urely more than we, as having lo&s;t much more than we who do but mourn a friend. We cannot bring poor Lawrence back to life, but may re&s;tore at lea&s;t a &s;on to his afflicted mother. I have done &s;ome needle-work to plea&s;e my uncle, which he means to recompen&s;e by giving me an
<PB N="225" REF="237">elegant new gown. I will have the gown in ready money. And do you, on your &s;ide, u&s;e the greate&s;t expedition to complete the drawing that my papa has ordered. I am &s;ure, he will pay you very generou&s;ly for it. We will then unite our little &s;tock, and purcha&s;e the young &s;oldier his di&s;charge, thus &s;hewing our regard to the memory of old Lawrence: &s;o that, if mankind are to be recompen&s;ed in future for the good that they do in this life, this kind action will be put to his account, who was the cau&s;e there|of, and he will know that we love him &s;till as much as ever. I &s;hall &s;et out this day &s;e'nnight to come home, when we will &s;ettle the affair together, and de&s;ire papa to execute it. He will certainly be glad to &s;erve us, and this hope is much the &s;weete&s;t that I can ta&s;te, till I have once again the joy of &s;eeng you. Farewel! I am rejoiced that I can on my part contribute the renewed friend&s;hip of which you &s;peak, and which will la&s;t as long as I have breath.</P>

<HEAD>From Dormer Lennox to Je&s;&s;ica his &s;i&s;ter.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Si&s;ter,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Think, I &s;ee you put on an air of importance on re|ceiving a letter from me already, when I have hard|ly got a mile beyond the thre&s;hold of the door. However, be not very proud of &s;uch an honour, &s;ince I write it, in the fir&s;t place, by command; as my papa imagines that if I &s;tart a corre&s;pondence and you &s;econd it, we &s;hall ac|quire &s;ome ea&s;e in letter-writing, which he &s;ays can only be attained by practice, ju&s;t like other arts; and in the next place, &s;ince I write not &s;o much for your &s;ake, as that of my canary-bird. When I &s;et out, I quite forgot to re|commend him to your friend&s;hip; and I know of &s;ome
<PB N="226" REF="238">young ladies, who would have an object con&s;tantly before their eyes, and yet forget it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their memory &s;hould not be conti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ually intere&s;ted by a compliment be&s;towed, at &s;ea|&s;on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le intervals, upon their vanity. Know then, that in the fulne&s;s of my power, I make you governe&s;s of Fi|dele, and grant you the entire controul of his hou&s;hold in future. Take the greate&s;t care not to forget the duties of your office, if you would not have me take it from you. It is extremely proper that I &s;hould make in this place one or two &s;agacious ob&s;ervations; namely, that the bird can no more live on nothing than your&s;elf; that if he does not eat and drink, he cannot live; that he will be inca|pable of &s;inging, if he dies; and la&s;t of all, that if he cea&s;es &s;inging, neither you nor I can hear him, which would be a pity. I conceive it needful al&s;o to remind you of his &s;ervice the other day, when you were making &s;uch &s;ad work <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s you remember of your minuet, by moving to his mu&s;ic while your di&s;regarded Mr. Dupr&eacute;'s kit. The little creature &s;et up &s;uch a pipe, that Mr. Dupr&eacute; turned his anger all on him, forgetting what your giddy heels de&s;erved. The&s;e rea&s;ons are, I think, &s;ufficient to engage your friend&s;hip in behalf of Fidele: but &s;till, if grati|tude and mu&s;ic have no manner of effect upon your marble heart, I have nothing out the thunder of my eloquence to move you.&mdash;Tremble therefore! Think him dead already. Yes, Je&s;&s;ica, dead! and then determine how you will be able to &s;upport &s;o &s;hocking an idea. Fancy that you be|hold him lying with his feet uppermo&s;t, his wings grown &s;tiff, his eyes and little beak &s;hut fa&s;t for ever. See him laid upon his back within the little box that you intend for his coffin, and &s;urrounded on every &s;ide with night|&s;hade, vervain, cypre&s;s-branches and the weeping-willow. Every body mourns him. They enquire, what cruel hand has plunged him thu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to eternal darkne&s;s. A lamenting voice makes an&s;wer, It was I, unfeeling as I am! and in&s;tantly you throw your&s;elf be&s;ide him. But I think you weep. If &s;o, let me cry, Victory! for I have nothing now to &s;ear upon account of Fidele, or for the quiet of your &s;hade. Be&s;ides his ordinary victuals, do not forget to let him have every day, a bit of bi&s;cuit or a lump of &s;ugar. You will al&s;o do extrem <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> well to &s;hade his hou&s;e with &s;omething green, as it would &s;often his affliction in my ab|&s;ence.

<HEAD>From Je&s;&s;ica to Dormer.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TRULY one mu&s;t have queer notions to &s;uppo&s;e that a &s;i&s;ter &s;hould be proud of hearing from her brother! I imagine, all the boa&s;ting &s;hould be rather upon your &s;ide in reflecting, that for once at lea&s;t you have performed your duty, and not had your ears well pulled before-hand; though you lo&s;e all merit in the matter, by in&s;inuating that you have written to me by papa's command, and for the &s;ake of little Noi&s;y. But indeed, you needed not have recommended Fidele &s;o &s;trongly to my care, or la|vi&s;hed &s;uch a deal of rhetoric in his behalf. He is wor|thy of all my attention on his own account; &s;o pray do not be unea&s;y le&s;t I &s;hould not u&s;e him kindly. It is true, I &s;hall not fill his trough till it runs over, after the example of &s;ome little boys that I know, who would not care a farthing &s;hould he bur&s;t, as certainly he would, were he as fond as they are of his belly. Very likely too they would make one think that they overload him thus with victuals purely through kindne&s;s, when they only do it, that they may not have &s;o trouble&s;ome a ta&s;k again upon their hands for ten or fifteen days to come. No, no; I will &s;how my&s;elf much more regular in my attention to him, as he certainly &s;hall have fre&s;h victuals every mor|ning. Ye&s;terday when I approached his cage to clean it, the fir&s;t thing that I &s;aw was &s;eed &s;ufficient to &s;ubti&s;t him for a month, without including what was &s;cattered on the bottom. To be &s;ure, I mu&s;t confe&s;s he is &s;uch a &s;pend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hrift,
<PB N="228" REF="240">that he &s;catters more about him in an hour, than would &s;uffice him for a day. But how &s;hall I de&s;cribe the floor of his apart|ment? Thanks to your attention or your &s;lothful wa&s;te, it was exactly like a pond, occa&s;ioned by continual overflow|ings from the fountain, and poor Fidele could not de&s;cend for fear of being drowned. How rejoiced he was to &s;ee the dry land! At fir&s;t, he could not think of coming down, without precaution, as he tried it with one foot, while with the other he clung clo&s;ely to the wire-work. Thus with|out the lea&s;t expence have I enlarged his habitation; for he always kept upon the perches, fearing to dirt his feet and tail at lea&s;t, if not, as I have &s;aid ju&s;t now, to be drown|ed. I have &s;trewed a layer of fine &s;and upon the bottom of his man&s;ion, and adorned the &s;ides and top with ground&s;el, &s;o that now he may &s;uppo&s;e him&s;elf within a &s;hady grove. In future, brother, you may do as you think pro|per, but it is I that take upon me to provide for Fidele. I will have his palace &s;erve you as a model of propri|ety and ta&s;te in <HI>your</HI> apartment. I have written now enough I think to quiet the unea&s;ine&s;s that you intimated in your letter; and mu&s;t tell you that I have al&s;o my in|quietudes, which I proceed to mention. You are certain|ly a little giddy-headed, and we have here a &s;ly black cat that comes a prowling daily. Take you care when you re|turn. I have ob&s;erved that he has conceived a love for Fi|dele, &s;ufficient to alarm one. Ye&s;terday betimes, when I came in to give him food, I forgot to &s;hut the door, and pu&s;s had crept in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly after me. When I had waited on the bird, and given him what he wanted, I begun to thumb your books, when &s;uddenly I heard a tender <HI>mewing</HI> behind me: I turned in&s;tantly about, and &s;aw Grimalkin wriggling his whole bo|dy every way upon a &s;ofa, oppo&s;ite the cage. He was ad|miring Fidele, he played his tail about, and &s;eemed to &s;ay, "My dear, &s;weet pretty bird, come now and perch clo&s;e by me; or el&s;e &s;tay, I will jump upon your cage, for only &s;ee what nice &s;oft paws I have to hug you! (but remark, he carefully concealed his claws.) I will fondle you all day, and pre&s;s you to my tender heart. Do not let my whi&s;kers frighten you: they are long enough, I mu&s;t acknowledge, but wont hurt you. I have a little mouth beneath them, Fidele, with which I will ki&s;s your pretty beak." Now what I do you imagine Fidele replied to the&s;e fine words?&mdash; Why nothing; but with ea&s;e one might di&s;cern that he
<PB N="229" REF="241">was not likely to become Grimalkin's dupe; and I &s;uppo&s;e in pu&s;&s;ey's place he would have been as great a rogue. Have you been his in&s;tructor, brother, after all?&mdash;He &s;tooped and rai&s;ed his head, he &s;hook his feathers, and ca&s;t many a look of diffidence upon the orator, and of confidence on me, as if he would have &s;aid, "I know you very well. Your &s;ugared words, your nice &s;oft paws, and little mouth concealed beneath your whi&s;kers, are no le&s;s perfidious than your tender heart. You may deceive perhaps a poor mou&s;e: but me&mdash;Oh! no: I laugh at all your cunning, and defy your malice. I have here a friend to &s;ave me." Upon which he &s;et a crying <HI>queek, queek, queek,</HI> with all his might. I under|&s;tood him perfectly well; and without pretending that I heard any thing, I ran in&s;tantly to that part of the chamber, where there &s;tood a ci&s;tern full of water, and be&s;prinkled our young gentleman &s;o finely, as to put out all at once the fervour of his friend&s;hip. For he needed but one jump to be upon the floor, and as he ran away, he &s;hook his coat as if he had the ague. Recollect this ob&s;ervation, &s;hould he come incognito upon a vi&s;it, after you have returned.</P>
<P>This mealy-mouthed, good-natured animal, whom many in the world re&s;emble, made me recollect an Ode our friend wrote, and which was lying in the paper-ca&s;e. I &s;end it you, that if you know of any good compo&s;er in your neighbourhood, you may prevail upon him for my &s;ake to &s;et it, as they &s;ay, to mu&s;ic.</P>

<P>I have been hard at work the&s;e three days on the jour|nal of my travels, which I promi&s;ed to &s;end you, as a recompence for your care of Fidele. Papa approves the thought of our communicating our adventures thus to one another. His opinion, as I have already told you, is that by this &s;ort of corre&s;pondence we &s;hall acquire a habit of inditing with facility, and properly reflecting on &s;uch objects as may &s;trike our &s;ight. As much as I have written, he informs me, &s;eems to have been done with accuracy, and de&s;ires to read the account that you have promi&s;ed of your dinner in the country with mama. Fre|deric and Loui&s;a certainly were of the party: Oh, how much impertinence mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity have pa&s;&s;ed between you! but indeed, though you &s;hould tell me only of your own, I know, you have a &s;tock in hand &s;ufficient to &s;upply a chapter, and that chapter not the &s;horte&s;t that was ever written. To encourage you in &s;ending me this chapter with the greate&s;t expedition, I &s;hall be my&s;elf as quick as po&s;&s;ible in the collation of the &s;everal parcels of my narra|tive, in&s;cribed on more than twenty &s;craps of paper.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT can you be thinking of, to let me wait &s;o long before I &s;ee the journal of your expedition? Are you gone, like Gulliver, to &s;ome unknown &s;trange i&s;land, for the &s;ake of having &s;uch atchievements to record, as no one will be authorized to contradict? I cannot but admire the great exactitude and order on which you pride your&s;elf &s;o much, in the mention of your twenty &s;craps of paper,
<PB N="232" REF="244">&s;cattered up and down, no doubt in every corner of your chamber. It will be fortunate however, if the little cat belonging to your habitation does not plea&s;e her&s;elf by playing with the be&s;t part of your narrative. I &s;hould not be a&s;toni&s;hed, were I to di&s;cover many cha&s;ms in it, or perceive that you had begun with the conclu&s;ion, and affixed the fag-end, as we &s;ay, where the commencement &s;hould be, which would prove at lea&s;t as entertaining as the chapter &s;tuffed with my impertinences. I cannot tell at pre&s;ent, if the ci&s;tern-full of water would look well in my e&s;cutcheon: but &s;uppo&s;e that your &s;ybill's leaves would make a &s;pecial coat of arms for you.

<P>ONE has no occa&s;ion to go over &s;o much ground as you have travelled, to be able to &s;upply the reader with adventures. We had hardly pa&s;&s;ed the &s;econd turnpike on the Clapham road, before we fell in with a drover, who was bringing up about a hundred &s;heep to London. As our coachman thought his honour concerned in not permitting &s;uch a &s;crabby drove of cattle to u&s;urp the road and make him quit his track, he drove the carriage through them. The poor &s;heep, who are accounted to have hone&s;t hearts, but we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k intellects, not knowing whither they &s;hould run, in their confu&s;ion got between the hor&s;es legs; and &s;ome were even entangled in the &s;pokes. The drover bid the coachman &s;top, as loud as he
<PB N="233" REF="245">could roar; but the coachman, deaf to his vociferations, would not in the lea&s;t relax his &s;peed, and &s;till continued on the trot. The wind was rather fre&s;h, and therefore we had all the gla&s;&s;es up. My brother Frederic wi&s;hed to know by what means the poor &s;heep would free them&s;elves from their embarra&s;&s;ment. Unfortunately, he forgot that if he wi&s;hed to look about him, it was nece&s;&s;ary fir&s;t of all to let the gla&s;s down, and of cour&s;e he thru&s;t his head quite through and through the brittle cry&s;tal, which that moment broke into a thou&s;and pieces. You may judge with what alacrity he drew his head in once again; but in &s;o doing, he was &s;lightly wounded in his forehead by a piece of the broken gla&s;s. He put his hand directly on the part, and &s;o contrived, as with the little blood pro|ceeding from the &s;cratch, to &s;mear his face all over com|pletely, and looked exactly like the Jolly Bacchus, at the alehou&s;e oppo&s;ite our door. Loui&s;a, at this &s;ight, was &s;ure that her brother mu&s;t have had his no&s;e cut off, and did not doubt but it had dropped among the &s;heep; on which the tender-hearted little thing began to cry, Fre|deric! ah my poor dear brother! till mama had, with a little &s;cented water which &s;he poured upon her handker|chief, wiped his face clean, and given it once more that &s;ly look which you know it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. Well, dear brother, what are your ideas? I, for my part, fancy that you do not engro&s;s all the giddine&s;s belonging to our family, and already little Frederic gives full proof that he is not a jot le&s;s giddy than his elder brother.</P>
<P>Nothing worth mention happened after this event, till we arrived at Margaret's, our dear nur&s;e, with whom we were to dine and &s;tay till evening. After having all of us received her kind embraces, we went through the hou&s;e, and into the fields, where we propo&s;ed to take a walk. By accident, I was a little di&s;tant from the re&s;t; and as I pa&s;&s;ed along a hedge, ob&s;erved three little birds that had been taken by the leg in a perfidious &s;pringe. The pretty creatures flapped their wings mo&s;t lamentably, and implored me, or at lea&s;t I thought &s;o, to &s;et them free. You may &s;uppo&s;e, I did not &s;how my&s;elf in&s;en&s;ible to their petition. In&s;tantly I broke their bonds, and had the plea&s;ure to behold how grateful they appeared; for I could fancy gratitude in all their motions, as they flew away. This pity that I had &s;hown them did not plea&s;e a
<PB N="234" REF="246">little country boy who lived hard by, and had e&s;tabli&s;hed very greedy hopes upon the &s;ale of the&s;e three pri&s;oners; &s;o that their deliverance, as I mean to let you &s;ee, and &s;hortly, but for accidental circum&s;tances, might have co&s;t us dear.</P>
<P>The &s;un towards noon had di&s;&s;ipated all the mi&s;ts. The day was &s;o delightful, that mama de&s;ired we might enjoy the plea&s;ure of a rural meal, and therefore reque&s;ted Mar|garet to let us have our dinner in the garden. After din|ner, we had &s;trawberries and cream; and at the very moment when poor Frederic with the freedom which country manners allow, happened to be lifting up the platter to his mouth, that he might &s;ave him&s;elf the trou|ble of di&s;patching matters with the &s;poon, a &s;tone (behold ye) &s;truck it right upon the rim, and over&s;et its who&s;e contents upon the table, not without fir&s;t plentifully be|&s;prinkling &s;everal of us round about. You &s;hould have &s;een us in the height of our confu&s;ion, palpitating as we &s;at with fright, as if we had imagined that Jupiter was flinging down his thunderbolts among us. Margaret's hu&s;band, who is not a man to &s;woon away at every noi&s;e, that moment po&s;ted towards the garden door, to catch this thundering deity, who was certainly the little pea&s;ant that had &s;et the &s;pringes. But the deity, like tho&s;e men|tioned in Homer, who amu&s;ed them&s;elves at the expence of mortals, had already made him&s;elf invi&s;ible. It was all lo&s;t labour that our ho&s;t &s;tood &s;entry at the door. He only &s;aved us from the danger of another thunderbolt, which might have otherwi&s;e been pointed at us.</P>
<P>Dinner was now over, and I thought of paying one more vi&s;it to the neighbouring hedges, and delivering, if I could, &s;ome other pri&s;oners, when mama informed us that we mu&s;t think of &s;etting out on our return. We en|tered the coach once more with &s;ome reluctance, after having made dear Margaret our little pre&s;ents each. There never &s;ure had been a finer evening. From a hill, upon the top of which our coachman &s;topped to give his hor&s;es breath, we had the plea&s;ure to behold a &s;pacious horizon aderned with clouds of every colour, and &s;et off with gold. The &s;un, that as I thought rejoiced in having acce&s;s to us given him by Frederic, coloured, out of gratitude, Lou|i&s;a's face and his with all the purple of his rays. Our cou&s;in, who you know has been abroad, at &s;uch a &s;ight
<PB N="235" REF="247">turned round, and told mama that they looked exactly like the cherubims that Roman Catholics are u&s;ed to place for ornament about the altars in their churches.</P>
<P>The poor &s;heep that we met in the morning, certainly mu&s;t have alarmed their comrades, and gone off, as we encountered none on our return. We met no &s;ort of company but half a dozen a&s;&s;es who had certainly a very reverend figure, and a mule or two. Our hor&s;es, who, I fancy, thought they could di&s;cern a family re&s;emblance in the&s;e la&s;t, were giving up the right-hand &s;ide of the road, and complimenting them with fifty gambols and curvets; but our proud coachman would pre&s;erve the honour of his &s;eat, and feelingly convinced them with his whip, that they were creatures of much more importance; and that ranking as they did above them in all books of natural hi&s;tory, it was but ju&s;t they &s;hould pre&s;erve it on the road. They were obliged to yield a&s;&s;ent to arguments &s;o &s;triking, and got home in perfect order, and without another mi&s;|adventure.</P>

<P>WE rolled along in &s;ilence for the &s;pace of twenty minutes in our carriage, with no le&s;s velocity than the clouds above our heads. I ble&s;&s;ed the memory of him who fir&s;t of all invented this delightful way of travelling without pain or trouble; and &s;hall always think it charm|ing, till &s;ome other per&s;on brings the project to perfection of tran&s;porting us &s;till more delightfully, by means of a ballcon, with eagles to direct it.</P>
<P>I was meditating on this &s;ubject, when of a &s;udden I perceived the coachman violently exerci&s;ed at &s;omething or another. His great coat had &s;lipped from off his &s;eat on one of the front wheels, which carried it about the center. After many revolutions, he had made &s;hift to fa&s;ten on a &s;leeve, which he was pulling to him, and eja|culating as he tugged, My coat! my coat! I thru&s;t my head out ha&s;tily to &s;ee what ailed him, when my hat blew off; &s;o I joined in concert with the coachman, and cried out as lu&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly, My hat! my hat! Poor Jeffry, from his &s;tation in the rear, &s;tood witne&s;s to my lamentations, and leaned over towards me, when, behold ye! the furred cap that he wears, fell off. He did not imitate us, crying out, My cap! my cap! but aiming to recover it when falling, &s;omehow or another lo&s;t his footing, and came down the neare&s;t way head-foremo&s;t. Happily for Jeffry we were going through a very &s;oft quagmire, otherwi&s;e I cannot pretend to tell you what misfortune would have befel his limbs; at lea&s;t, I am &s;ure, his no&s;e and chin would have been both demoli&s;hed, as he fell into the quagmire belly downwards. All this happened in a mi|nute. My papa, in this confu&s;ion, was the only per&s;on who retained his &s;en&s;es. He let down the gla&s;s in front, and &s;eizing on the coachman's reins, which now were fallen from him, &s;topped the hor&s;es. Upon this, the coachman getting down, made &s;hift to free his coat. But what long faces did he make, when he &s;aw in the middle of the back a mon&s;trous rent, through which a judge might ea&s;ily have thru&s;t his head, and not di&s;ordered his huge wig. On his &s;ide, Jeffry, as I &s;aw, had got his mouth &s;o filled with mud, that he could not for a time bring out a &s;ingle &s;yllable. O &s;i&s;ter! had you &s;een him
<PB N="237" REF="249">thus beplai&s;tered as he was, affect a grin, in order to &s;how papa that his fall had broke no bones, I am &s;ure, you would have laughed for a month to come, at recollecting his appearance. He did nothing in the world but &s;neeze, and &s;putter, &s;hake him&s;elf, and rub his knees and elbows with both hands: his coat, which had been green, no longer now pre&s;erved that colour any where, except be|hind. In &s;hort, he looked as if he was dre&s;t for a ma&s;querade.</P>
<P>He went a little back to &s;eek his fox-&s;kin cap. By great good luck, the maker had not taken off the crea|ture's tail, but left it on to &s;erve by way of plume. By that, it was di&s;covered in the quagmire, and by that fi&s;hed up. When he had got it out, he was obliged to wring it twenty times, before it was in a &s;tate for travelling, even under Jeffry's arm. He al&s;o picked up my hat, but not before the wind had made it cut a hundred capers this and that way in the air. It lo&s;t however nothing by &s;o many &s;omer&s;ets; on the contrary, it got a comfortable coat, which, though all the bru&s;hes of the hou&s;e have frequently been exerci&s;ed upon it, neverthele&s;s it &s;till retains, and &s;eems determined to retain, in &s;pite of their beards.</P>
<P>After we were once again prepared for motion forward, and affairs about us in their former order, we proceeded to philo&s;ophize upon the&s;e accidents: but after having tried to do &s;o in a very &s;erious &s;train, we fancied the be&s;t method was to take the affair more gaily. My papa drew con&s;olation from his pur&s;e to give the coachman; and on my &s;ide, as I ob&s;erved Jeffry in pain about his fur-cap only, &s;ince the livery was his ma&s;ter's property, I tipped him &s;uch a wink as re&s;tored him to a better temper. After which, we all went forward, ju&s;t as if no accident had happened.</P>
<P>We were now come near a village, when papa di&s;cerned an ancient &s;oldier &s;eated on a &s;tone be&s;ide the road. One leg was under him, bent backward, and the other, a wooden one, &s;tuck out &s;tiff before him. A long crutch lay quietly upon his left, and on his right-hand &s;at a great black dog. Papa, who loves a &s;oldier, and parti|cularly when that &s;oldier is a cripple, courteou&s;ly &s;aluted him, and bade me fling a &s;hilling to him, which he gave me. I fulfilled &s;o honourable a commi&s;&s;ion in a very dexterous manner, I may &s;ay without the lea&s;t degree of
<PB N="238" REF="250">o&s;tentation, as I did not mi&s;s the hat. The &s;oldier's gra|titude was uttered in &s;o high a pitch, that it &s;ufficed to wake a &s;orry beggar-woman, who lay &s;leeping not far off upon a little &s;traw. She trotted after us, and reached the carriage ju&s;t as we were ready to alight and put up at an inn. "Ah, &s;ir!" &s;aid &s;he to my papa, "how you be&s;tow your charity! and if you give it to an old drunkeu fellow, what a&s;&s;i&s;tance will you afford an hone&s;t woman, as I am, who have not &s;wallowed the&s;e ten years a gla&s;s of any liquor &s;tronger than &s;mall beer?"&mdash;Papa, who&s;e mind was occupied on many &s;ubjects at that in&s;tant, was not thinking of the invalid, and viewed her with a vi&s;ible a&s;toni&s;hment. "Yes, yes, &s;ir," continued &s;he, "it is of that drunken &s;oldier I am &s;peaking. Oh! I heard how much he thanked you for the &s;hilling which, it &s;eems, you threw him by this little gentleman. I would lay a wager, that, before night comes, he will have &s;pent it all in gin. And then, &s;ir, did not you remark the great black dog be&s;ide him as he &s;at? A beggar keep a dog! What is that but robbing other people who de&s;erve a&s;&s;i&s;tance?"&mdash;"Hold your tongue!" &s;aid my papa, and &s;eemed quite angry. "Why abu&s;e a man at this rate, who has no le&s;s need than you of my compa&s;&s;ion? If he drinks a little gin, I can forgive an ancient &s;oldier &s;uch a fault. While we are &s;eated at our ea&s;e before a good fire, and even you are not without &s;o great a comfort, &s;oldiers mu&s;t endure the wind, &s;now, rain, and every rigour of cold winter. Where can be the wonder then, if they &s;hould have re|cour&s;e to what is &s;ure to warm them, and in time become accu&s;tomed to it? And re&s;pecting his great dog, perhaps that animal may be the only friend that he has, his tried a&s;&s;ociate, and the &s;ingle creature who partakes of his bad days."&mdash;When he had &s;aid the&s;e words, he held out two|pence, without looking at her. She received them with a kind of &s;oorn, and went off grumbling all the way, as long as we could hear her &s;peak. The ill-natured wretch had made me angry. "I am very &s;orry, &s;ir," &s;aid I, "that you gave her any thing. She mu&s;t be &s;ure a very horrid creature to abu&s;e a poor old &s;oldier, and be envious of the alms that you gave him."&mdash;"You are in the right," replied my father. "He who wi&s;hes to excite my pity, to another's detriment, de&s;erves my indignation only. Yet I &s;aw that &s;he was in want, and only upon that ac|count
<PB N="239" REF="251">forgot her evil di&s;po&s;ition. It is puni&s;hment enough that &s;he is reduced to beg. Had &s;he but kept her tongue in bounds, I would have given her what the &s;oldier had."</P>
<P>While we were thus di&s;cour&s;ing with each other, our ho&s;t had &s;hown us up into a room, of which one window opened towards the road that we had been travelling, and another towards a yard behind the hou&s;e. While they were getting dinner ready, I &s;tood looking out, to mark the carriages that were continually going by; and what can you imagine, &s;i&s;ter, I beheld, when I had hardly been a minute there?&mdash;the beggar-woman, who was now come back, and had by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ime &s;et her&s;elf upon a block be&s;ide the gate-way. She p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d out a little fla&s;ket full of brandy from her pocket, and began to give a hearty pull. I called out to papa, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd bade him come and &s;ee. He told me not to &s;peak, le&s;t we &s;hould be overheard. We both looked at her, and &s;oon &s;aw the &s;oldier likewi&s;e coming down the road, &s;upported by his crutch, and fol|lowed by the great black dog. As &s;oon as the old woman &s;aw him ha&s;ting towards her, &s;he put up her fla&s;ket with the greate&s;t ha&s;te into her pocket. We were both of us the greate&s;t ha&s;te into her pocket. We were both of us curious to overhear their conver&s;ation. "Mother," &s;aid the &s;oldier, who was now come pretty near her, "do you mean to take a lodging here, and have no dinner? You are not hungry, I &s;uppo&s;e."&mdash;"Heaven help me!" &s;aid the hypocrite, and made as if &s;he wept. "I a&s;&s;ure you, my good friend, I do not want for an appetite: if I could but come at &s;omething good to eat, I &s;hould not much mind what it was."&mdash;"If that be all," replied the gene|rous &s;oldier, "I have &s;ufficient for us both." On this he &s;at down by her, &s;lipped a knap&s;ack from his &s;houlder, and took out a lump of coar&s;e brown bread, together with a &s;lice of chee&s;e wrapt up in paper, which he held out to the woman, &s;aying, "There, good woman, help your|&s;elf." She did, and pretty plentifully. He put up with what was left, though but a trifle; and of this, for every bit that he ate him&s;elf, the large black dog had likewi&s;e his &s;hare, who had a&s;&s;umed his place behind, and all the while was re&s;ting in a very friendly way his head upon his ma&s;ter's &s;houlder.</P>
<P>During their repa&s;t, the hypocritical old woman turned her conver&s;ation on the unfeelingne&s;s of travellers; adding that the gentleman, who had but ju&s;t before alighted from
<PB N="240" REF="252">his carriage and put up for dinner at the inn before them, gave her only a poor halfpenny. "That cannot be true," replied the hone&s;t-hearted &s;oldier. "He mu&s;t be a noble gentleman; or certainly he had no money in his pur&s;e but gold, which could not ea&s;ily be changed. See, what he threw me by the little gentleman his &s;on&mdash;a &s;hilling! It is not always that pieces of this weight of metal tumble into my hat. But do not you fret your&s;elf, for you &s;hall be the better for my luck. I cannot be happy by my&s;elf. A good repa&s;t requires good liquor, and I have not had a drop within my lips to-day, although it is very late. The truth is, my poor money bag was &s;o con&s;umptive, that I could ea&s;ily have pa&s;&s;ed it through a needle's eye this morning; but thank heaven, at pre&s;ent it is quite plump and jolly, &s;o that I can well afford to lay out &s;ix|pence for us both. Come, good mother, let me have your hand."</P>
<P>Saying thus, he ro&s;e much in &s;pirits, and quite jovial. The old woman took upon her the attendant's part, and officiou&s;ly held him out his crutch, care&s;&s;ing now and then the dog. I could have found it in my heart to beat the wretch for this di&s;&s;embled friend&s;hip. They walked up together to the hou&s;e, and entered at the gate-way; while on our part, we above &s;tairs &s;hifted ground, and ha&s;tened towards the other window which looked out into the yard. We heard the &s;oldier call for a gill of brandy with two little gla&s;&s;es, one of which he filled and gave the woman, who made ha&s;te and &s;wallowed it immediately. Papa could not re&s;train his indignation any longer. "Out on &s;uch a hateful creature!" cried he.&mdash;They both lifted up their heads. The woman recollecting us, that moment gave a &s;hriek; but, on the contrary, the &s;oldier was not di&s;con|certed. "See," &s;aid he, "good &s;ir, how we are making merry through your bounty. Let me drink your health," continued he, and took his hat off, "with the gentleman your &s;on's. I never forget any one, however little, that is but generou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed."&mdash;"Much good may the liquor do you, my worthy fellow," an&s;wered my papa. "I like your &s;pirit. However poor you are, you can oblige; &s;o here is a trifle more to &s;trengthen your remembrance of us," throwing him a half-crown piece. "But as for all tho&s;e wretches that can fir&s;t abu&s;e an hone&s;t fellow, and then drink his liquor ju&s;t as if it were their own"&mdash;
<PB N="241" REF="253">The wretch would hear no more, hung down her head, and in confu&s;ion &s;neaked away.</P>
<P>While we were both at dinner, the landlord informed us that the hone&s;t &s;oldier, who&s;e name was Trim, had been a long while in the &s;ervice; that he had not quitted it before he lo&s;t his leg, and had the friend&s;hip and e&s;teem of all his officers. "It is he," continued the ho&s;t, "who keeps up peace and order in the village, &s;ince his &s;oldier|like appearance awes the vagabonds about us. Every body would be glad to give him victuals, if he would but take their bounty; but he never will accept of any thing that he has not earned by &s;ome good &s;ervice or another, as by going upon errands, which he does with no le&s;s expedition than fidelity. I &s;hould have put him in a pa&s;|&s;ion, had I even refu&s;ed to take his money for the gill of brandy. He a&s;&s;erts that I ought to live by what I get in trade, whoever are my cu&s;tomers; and &s;ays that, if I gave him any thing, I &s;hould be then obliged to charge it el&s;ewhere, which would be unju&s;t. As regularly as the morning comes, he goes out loaded with a ba&s;ket full of flints upon his &s;houlder, and fills up the holes that have been made the day before along the road. You mu&s;t have noticed in what admirable order it appeared. He never a&s;ks for any thing; but there is &s;carce a traveller accu&s;|tomed to the road who does not throw him &s;omething as he pa&s;&s;es by. He takes it without any he&s;itation, as he thinks that he has de&s;erved it. This is his employ all &s;ummer; and in winter, when the weather is at the colde&s;t, he fills up his time in making children's wooden clog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, for which he takes up his &s;eat in my kitchen chimney. He generou&s;ly gives the&s;e clogs to tho&s;e who&s;e parents are &s;o poor that they cannot pay his price, le&s;t they &s;hould happen to catch cold. The only recompen&s;e that he a&s;ks of them for this trouble, is to &s;ee them dance before him."</P>
<P>Well, &s;i&s;ter, what are your thoughts of this good|hearted Trim? This la&s;t particular in his &s;tory gave me &s;o much plea&s;ure, that I ordered a pair immediately for you, which I &s;hall take when I return. As you are far too generous, and be&s;ides too di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt to di&s;charge the value of the clogs in capers, I have engaged my&s;elf, as you would do, to pay him for them in hard money. I de&s;ign to give him half-a-crown, and then the clogs will
<PB N="242" REF="254">be much worthier of you. They will not be u&s;ele&s;s, if you mean to run about at any time next winter in the garden.</P>
<P>If I did not apprehend that my journal had already tired your patience, I &s;hould have a great deal more to mention. I would tell you how, as we were going on, I terminated an important matter in a way which Don Quixote, celebrated as he was for bravery, would never have thought of. You will &s;uppo&s;e, perhaps, that after &s;uch a preface, there was an inchanter, or at lea&s;t a giant in the ca&s;e, or &s;ome illu&s;trious prince&s;s to deliver, or &s;ome great kingdom to be recovered by conque&s;t. It was no|thing of all this. It was no other than a little girl who was tending a cow, and a boy engaged in the &s;ame office with an a&s;s, who were &s;truggling with each other for an apple which the former had found. After having very gravely taken all the nece&s;&s;ary information of their quar|rel, I took up, as you may gue&s;s, the weaker party, and defended her, but not in more than words, &s;ince fortu|nately for the &s;tronger, I had neither lance nor &s;hield; or rather, to confe&s;s a truth, becau&s;e, even though I had, he was of a &s;ize to thra&s;h my knighthood &s;oundly. I per|ceived immediately that the moderation of a Solomon or a Titus &s;uited much better with my inferiority of &s;ize, and therefore I adju&s;ted the affair in conte&s;t to the &s;atisfac|tion of both combatants, by &s;haring equally between them the remainder of that tart which you know the cook had made me, that I might not faint with hunger by the way.</P>
<P>I might go on, and tell you of the pitiable fortune of a hare that we &s;aw running acro&s;s the country, followed by a pack of hounds and hunt&s;men. The poor creature, after having often thrown them out, as is the phra&s;e with &s;port&s;men, by her doublings on the open plain, had crimbed a pointed rock. A furious dog perceived her in this la&s;t retreat, and had the audacity to force her. I beheld them both roll down the precipice together, mi|&s;erably mangled.&mdash;But this picture is much too cruel: is it not Je&s;&s;ica?&mdash;Let me therefore touch on themes more p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing, and inform you of the joy that our unexpected coming here gave every one belonging to the hou&s;e. If your dry jokes had not for ever undeceived me on the &s;ubject of my own exclu&s;ive merit, I &s;hould think my&s;elf a cleverer fellow, from the hearty welcome that we re|ceived. It is much more mode&s;t in me to &s;uppo&s;e my&s;elf
<PB N="243" REF="255">indebted for that welcome to the recollection of your vi&s;it here, which they have cheri&s;hed ever &s;ince la&s;t year. I do &s;uppo&s;e it, and place all my boa&s;t in thanking you for having laid the ground-work of the entertainment that I am now experiencing.</P>
<P>And thus, dear &s;i&s;ter, I have &s;ent you a recital of my wonderful adventures, which perhaps you will think too tedious. The mo&s;t perilous of every circum&s;tance attend|ing them was, when, to give you &s;ome amu&s;ement, I en|gaged to put them down in black and white. I thought that I never &s;hould have come to the conclu&s;ion of my ta&s;k. I will not boa&s;t of any merit in the execution of my great undertaking, and yet I plea&s;e my&s;elf with thinking that you will owe my kindne&s;s &s;omething, when you come to be acquainted that at pre&s;ent they have been ringing for me the&s;e ten minutes to come down and eat &s;ome fritters which are growing cold, while I my&s;elf am hard at work in winding up my letter. I can hardly fancy that the heroi&s;m of fraternal love ever yet went much farther than I have pu&s;hed it in this &s;ingle in&s;tance for your &s;ake.</P>
<P>Adieu, dear &s;i&s;ter! I will divert my&s;elf as much as po&s;|&s;ible for your &s;ake rather than my own, that at the time of my return I may pre&s;ent my&s;elf before you &s;o much the more merry-hearted. I cannot tell what you may think of this; but I, for my part, think that you &s;hould look upon it as a proof of the tenderne&s;s of that attachment with which I am, dear &s;i&s;ter, yours,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD>From Je&s;&s;ica to Dormer.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE often heard that nothing forms the under&s;tand|ing &s;o effectually as travelling, and your narrative &s;upplies me with a proof of the a&s;&s;ertion which I did not in the lea&s;t expect; for who would ever think that &s;uch a little animal as you &s;hould think of being a philo&s;opher for having travelled eighteen miles? You told me, in your fir&s;t epi&s;tle, that you de&s;igned the Journal of your Travels for po&s;terity. Whenever, therefore, you think fit to &s;end it as directed, I will take upon me to comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ete &s;uch &s;ketches as are fit to bear it company, which I will get corrected by my drawing-ma&s;ter. For example, our &s;olemn coach|man, who, without once changing place, gets hold of his
<PB N="244" REF="256">great coat, and lugs it by the &s;leeve; poor Jeffry ri&s;ing &s;olemnly and &s;lowly from his quagmire; and my giddy|headed brother quite uncovered at the chariot-door, and with his eyes pur&s;uing the poor hat in all its evolutions. Here are three droll figures; while papa, &s;till faithful to his character for prudence, &s;hall be repre&s;ented as in con|tra&s;t, &s;eizing on the coachman's reins to &s;top his hor&s;es. You do not think that I &s;hall forget the ancient &s;oldier and old woman dining on the block. Oh! how I &s;hall &s;trive to &s;et off to the be&s;t advantage hone&s;t Trim, together with his great black dog that ate &s;o amicably, leaning on his &s;houlder. Finally, I will terminate my gallery with the &s;cene betwixt your girl with the cow and your boy tending the a&s;s, not forgetting to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;cribe you as you repre&s;ent your&s;elf, con&s;idering gravely of their quarrel, and accom|modating matters with the fragments of an apple-tart. It is true, I &s;hall not write at the top the name of either Solomon or Titus, which your u&s;ual mode&s;ty, without the lea&s;t demur, lays claim to. I have thought of one more proper, namely, Sancho Panca, as I hardly ever knew, in all my life, a per&s;on of more under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, you will not wi&s;h to be behind-hand with me; therefore I give up the account of my adventures to you, in peru&s;ing which you will with ea&s;e &s;ugge&s;t &s;ufficient &s;ubjects to your own imagination for a &s;et of pictures no le&s;s inte|re&s;ting, I believe, than tho&s;e which, from peru&s;ing your atchievements, I have &s;ugge&s;ted, as you &s;ee, to mine.</P>
<P>I had nearly forgot to return you my thanks for ordering me the pair of clogs. My pur&s;e will not allow me to repay you the immen&s;e expence of &s;o magnificent a pre&s;ent; therefore you will let me &s;atisfy you for it as the little children pay Trim. I am learning a new caper for that purpo&s;e.&mdash;I am infinitely touched at your &s;uperior genero|&s;ity, in letting pa&s;s no opportunities of recreation, for my &s;ake; and beg you to believe that my &s;en&s;ibility will na|turally bid me do the like.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear Dorme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> As I take it, we are a match for one another in joking. I only wi&s;h to go beyond you in the boa&s;t of tender friend&s;hip, as becomes</P>
