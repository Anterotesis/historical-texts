<P>True, madam! <HI>Watcher</HI> is confined, but this confinement is rather form than reality.&mdash;And if he was of that &s;editious &s;pirit that we attribute to him, he has friends enough at his nod, to &s;hake the pillars, not of his p&mdash;n only, but the p&mdash;e too.&mdash;And it is from &s;ome violent attempt of that &s;ort, that my be&s;t hopes are at pre&s;ent founded.&mdash;But I fear he has too much penetration for us all;&mdash;for altho' he &s;u&s;tains the &s;pirit of the multitude, he artfully re&s;trains their impetuo&s;ity.&mdash;As for the j&mdash;s&mdash;I hope they lean to our &s;ide, but the &s;agacity of <HI>Man&s;upple</HI> is &s;o guarded, that he'll do nothing ra&s;hly&mdash;the be&s;t &s;ervices he will do for us, mu&s;t have, at lea&s;t, the countenance of l&mdash;.&mdash;The m&mdash;y are no doubt at our devotion; but even with re&s;pect to them, I am under &s;ome difficulties&mdash;there's Lord <HI>Shelter</HI> rides

<P><HI>Watcher</HI> does by no means either &s;educe or inflame them.&mdash;They are &s;en&s;ible that it is on account of his firm attachment to them, and to the ju&s;t influence he has got among&s;t them, that the re&s;entment of a&mdash;n &s;o keenly per&s;ecutes him; they ju&s;tly think, if they were to leave him to lie neglected in a pri&s;on, where he's confined for their &s;akes, it would be the height of ingratitude.&mdash;This leads numbers of them &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to &s;hew their per&s;onal gratitude, by which they imagine they keep up his &s;pirits&mdash;This is poi&s;on to his per&s;ecutors.&mdash;They make a parade of g&mdash;s, c&mdash;s, &amp;c.&mdash;Such parades always gather abundance of idlers; and the indifferent, and the intere&s;ted mingling together, look like a concour&s;e of people, and are how&s;oever quiet, branded with the name of mob!&mdash;The &s;cheme of g&mdash;t is to deter every body from &s;o much as looking at him.&mdash;In hopes, by procra&s;tinating his trial as they do, from day to day, that the people will at length be tired out, and &s;o de&s;ert him:&mdash;But to blame him with any fatal con&s;equences, is ju&s;t as rea&s;on|able as it would be to blame me.&mdash;If I &s;ent out a &s;hip to purcha&s;e wealth to the nation, and if by the mi&s;management of the ma&s;ter or pilot, the &s;hip &s;hould be lo&s;t&mdash;the lo&s;s of that &s;hip's crew may, I &s;ay, be as ju&s;tly imputed to me, as the murders of this day can be imputed to hone&s;t <HI>Jack Watcher.</HI></P>

<P>I'faith, friend <HI>Blunt,</HI> that little harangue of yours has had a better effect, and done more good in five minutes, than all the m&mdash;l force of the kingdom could have effected in a week.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BLUNT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I'll tell thee <HI>Hone&s;ty.</HI>&mdash;I &s;ay no|thing but what are in reality the &s;entiments of <HI>Watcher</HI> him&s;elf&mdash;In the beginning of his endea|vours here&mdash;popular appearances were nece&s;&s;ary for
<PB N="25" REF="28">
him, to &s;upply the defections of tho&s;e affected pa|triots who had formerly flattered him with their eternal protection.&mdash;He found, after he had ri&s;ked all, and &s;pent all, in pur&s;uit of the very &s;chemes they had concerted with him, that they had fallen off, and become &s;o luke-warm, that unle&s;s he &s;hould be able to in&s;pirit the public with a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of his and their own oppre&s;&s;ions, he mu&s;t fall a &s;acrifice to real merit&mdash;he therefore, did not at fir&s;t di&s;|courage their cabals; but as no man is more anxi|ous than he, to pre&s;erve order and harmony in the community, and knowing very well the danger|ous effects of popular fury; he has laboured with as much zeal to moderate their re&s;entments, as he nobly intends to employ for the redre&s;s of their grievances!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HON.</SPEAKER>
<P>But pray tell me, <HI>Blunt!</HI> have his lately &s;o great and powerful friends actually abandoned him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BLUNT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not entirely abandoned him,&mdash;that's what for their own &s;akes, at lea&s;t for the &s;ake of that popularity on which they would &s;till fain plume them&s;elves; they dare hardly do.&mdash;They continue I believe to contribute towards his ex|pence&mdash;but for his noble and &s;pirited mea&s;ures, they leave him to &s;truggle through them the be&s;t way he can.&mdash;They will not con&s;ent, I imagine, that he be too rigorou&s;ly handled; but they will as little concur with him in bringing to ju&s;tice tho&s;e tools of A&mdash;n who have di&s;graced and plunder|ed the nation, to aggrandize them&s;elves, and to cru&s;h the efforts of true patrioti&s;m.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HON.</SPEAKER>
<P>By my &s;oul&mdash;<HI>Blunt!</HI>&mdash;I always feared it would be &s;o&mdash;And yet, who could have thought it?&mdash;Who, for example to have heard the pa|triotic declamations of an orator <HI>Chatwell,</HI> while a c&mdash;r!&mdash;could have believed, he would ever
<PB N="26" REF="29">
&s;ubmit to that degenerated inactivity, in which they now rock him to &s;leep.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BLUNT.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Chatwell</HI>'s degeneracy does by no means &s;urprize me, I have ever lookt upon him to be the vaine&s;t of all men!&mdash;his be&s;t hopes were, from the beginning, founded in the people's applau&s;e; that he courted; that he obtained; and he has made a good account of it.&mdash;The amazing &s;uc|ce&s;s which crown'd his a&mdash;n, made him the idol of the people, who would not &s;ee how greedily he adorned him&s;elf with ornaments of which he often &s;poiled the real purcha&s;er; no man in the&s;e days dared to contradict him, and he therefore a&s;|&s;umed every glory to him&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why <HI>Blunt</HI>&mdash;all that's but too true&mdash;nor did I begrudge him at that time any honour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">he gra&s;pt at&mdash;I regarded him as the &s;aviour of a &s;inking &s;tate, and thought the more honour he acquired, the more he &s;hould have it in his power to di&s;tri|bute ju&s;tice.&mdash;</P>

<P>Yes, ju&s;tice!&mdash;what ju&s;tice pray did he attain for the hone&s;t q&mdash;I forgot his name&mdash;but who from pure publick &s;piritedne&s;s&mdash;threw him&s;elf out of a thriving trading company&mdash;Plan'd the attempt upon <HI>S&mdash;l</HI>&mdash;&s;pent every &s;hilling he had indu&s;triou&s;ly gained, that he might convince the M&mdash;y of his &s;incerity&mdash;a&s;&s;i&s;ted or at lea&s;t directed, in the operations which con|quered it,&mdash;came home big with the hopes of grateful acknowledgments from &s;o patriotic an A&mdash;n.&mdash;The&s;e hopes, not founded on imagi|nation only, but in written holograph a&s;&s;urances under the hand of the great patriot him&s;elf&mdash;and did not <HI>Chatwell</HI> neverthele&s;s, not only a&s;&s;ume to him&s;elf the whole merit of that &s;cheme, but would fain have retracted his promi&s;es&mdash;and becau&s;e the hone&s;t q&mdash;, un&s;chool'd in the

&s;cience of politicks, would not belye him&s;elf, and &s;uffer the whole honour of the project to be a&s;cribed &s;olely to <HI>Chatwell,</HI>&mdash;did not <HI>Chatwell</HI> in place of rewarding, neglect, and in&s;ult him?&mdash;And as I'm well a&s;&s;ured, had it not been for the genero&s;ity and truly patriotick application of Lord <HI>Shelter,</HI> the S&mdash;y, who &s;olicited and obtained a pen&s;ion for the original contriver of that conque&s;t,&mdash;then in very deep di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;the re&s;entment of <HI>Chat|well</HI> would have left the cheated q&mdash;, to have lamented in indigence the folly of a merchant, having for&s;ook trade, to &s;pend a fortune in the publick &s;ervice!</P>
