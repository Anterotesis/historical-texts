<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following LECTURES were read in the Univer&s;ity of Edin|burgh, for Twenty-four years. The publication of them, at pre&s;ent, was not altogether a matter of choice. Imperfect Copies of them, in Manu|&s;cript, from notes taken by Students who heard them read, were fir&s;t pri|vately handed about; and afterwards frequently expo&s;ed to public &s;ale. When the Author &s;aw them circulate &s;o currently, as even to be quoted in print<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Biographia Britannica. Article, ADDISON.</NOTE>, and found him&s;elf often threatened with &s;urreptitious publi|cations of them, he judged it to be high time that they &s;hould proceed from his own hand, rather than come into public view under &s;ome very defective and erroneous form.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3">
THEY were originally de&s;igned for the initiation of Youth into the &s;tu|dy of Belles Lettres, and of Compo|&s;ition. With the &s;ame intention they are now publi&s;hed; and, therefore, the form of Lectures, in which they were at fir&s;t compo&s;ed, is &s;till retain|ed. The Author gives them to the world, neither as a Work wholly ori|ginal, nor as a Compilation from the Writings of others. On every &s;ub|ject contained in them, he has thought for him&s;elf. He con&s;ulted his own ideas and reflections: and a great part of what will be found in the&s;e Lec|tures is entirely his own. At the &s;ame time, he availed him&s;elf of the ideas and reflections of others, as far as he thought them proper to be adopted. To proceed in this man|ner, was his duty as a Public Profe&s;&s;or. It was incumbent on him, to convey to his Pupils all the knowledge that could improve them; to deliver not merely what was new, but what might be u&s;eful, from whatever quarter it came. He hopes, that to &s;uch as are
<PB N="v" REF="4">
&s;tudying to cultivate their Ta&s;te, to form their Style, or to prepare them|&s;elves for Public Speaking or Compo|&s;ition, his Lectures will afford a more comprehen&s;ive view of what relates to the&s;e &s;ubjects, than, as far as he knows, is to be received from any one Book in our Language.</P>
<P>IN order to render his Work of greater &s;ervice, he has generally refer|red to the Books which he con&s;ulted, as far as he remembers them; that the Readers might be directed to any far|ther illu&s;tration which they afford. But, as &s;uch a length of time has elap&s;ed &s;ince the fir&s;t Compo&s;ition of his Lectures, he may, perhaps, have adopted the &s;entiments of &s;ome Au|thor into who&s;e Writings he had then looked, without now remembering whence he derived them.</P>
<P>IN the opinions which he has deli|vered concerning &s;uch a variety of Authors, and of literary matters, as come under his con&s;ideration, he
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
cannot expect that all his Readers will concur with him. The &s;ubjects are of &s;uch a nature; as allow room for much diver&s;ity of ta&s;te and &s;enti|ment: and the Author will re&s;pect|fully &s;ubmit to the judgment of the Public.</P>
<P>RETAINING the &s;implicity of the Lecturing Style, as be&s;t fitted for conveying in&s;truction, he has aimed, in his Language, at no more than per&s;picuity. If, after the liberties which it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to take, in critici&s;ing the Style of the mo&s;t eminent Writers in our lan|guage, his own Style &s;hall be thought open to reprehen&s;ion, all that he can &s;ay, is, that his Book will add one to the many proofs already afforded to the world, of its being much ea&s;ier to give in&s;truction, than to &s;et exam|ple.</P>

<HEAD>LECTURE I. INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>ONE of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed privileges which Providence has conferred upon mankind, is the power of communicating their thoughts to one another. De&s;titute of this power, Rea&s;on would be a &s;olitary, and, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, an unavailing principle. Speech is the great in&s;trument by which man becomes beneficial to man: and it is to the intercour&s;e and tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of thought, by means of &s;peech, that we are chiefly indebt|ed for the improvement of thought it&s;elf. Small are the advances which a &s;ingle una&s;|&s;i&s;ted individual can make towards perfect|ing any of his powers. What we call hu|man rea&s;on, is not the effort or ability of one, &s;o much as it is the re&s;ult of the rea&s;on of many, ari&s;ing from lights mutually com|municated, in con&s;equence of di&s;cour&s;e and writing.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="8">
IT is obvious, then, that writing and di&s;|cour&s;e are objects intitled to the highe&s;t atten|tion. Whether the influence of the &s;peaker, or the entertainment of the hearer, be con|&s;ulted; whether utility or plea&s;ure be the principal aim in view, we are prompted, by the &s;tronge&s;t motives, to &s;tudy how we may communicate our thoughts to one another with mo&s;t advantage. Accordingly we find, that in almo&s;t every nation, as &s;oon as lan|guage had extended it&s;elf beyond that &s;canty communication which was requi&s;ite for the &s;upply of men's nece&s;&s;ities, the improvement of di&s;cour&s;e began to attract regard. In the language even of rude uncultivated tribes, we can trace &s;ome attention to the grace and force of tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions which they u&s;ed, when they &s;ought to per&s;uade or to affect. They were early &s;en&s;ible of a beauty in di&s;|cour&s;e, and endeavoured to give it certain decorations which experience had taught them it was capable of receiving, long before the &s;tudy of tho&s;e decorations was formed in|to a regular art.</P>
<P>BUT, among nations in a civilized &s;tate, no art has been cultivated with more care, than that of language, &s;tyle, and compo&s;ition. The attention paid to it may, indeed, be a&s;|&s;umed as one mark of the progre&s;s of &s;ociety towards its mo&s;t improved period. For, ac|cording as &s;ociety improves and flouri&s;hes, men acquire more influence over one ano|ther by means of rea&s;oning and di&s;cour&s;e;
<PB N="3" REF="9">
and in proportion as that influence is felt to enlarge, it mu&s;t follow, as a natural con&s;e|quence, that they will be&s;tow more care up|on the methods of expre&s;&s;ing their concepti|ons with propriety and eloquence. Hence we find, that in all the poli&s;hed nations of Eu|rope, this &s;tudy has been treated as highly important, and has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable place in every plan of liberal education.</P>
<P>INDEED, when the arts of &s;peech and writ|ing are mentioned, I am &s;en&s;ible that preju|dices again&s;t them are apt to ri&s;e in the minds of many. A &s;ort of art is immediately thought of, that is o&s;tentatious and deceitful; the minute and trifling &s;tudy of words alone; the pomp of expre&s;&s;ion; the &s;tudied fallacies of rhetoric; ornament &s;ub&s;tituted in the room of u&s;e. We need not wonder, that under &s;uch imputations, all &s;tudy of di&s;|cour&s;e as an art, &s;hould have &s;uffered in the opinion of men of under&s;tanding: and I am far from denying, that rhetoric and critici&s;m have &s;ometimes been &s;o managed as to tend to the corruption, rather than to the im|provement, of good ta&s;te and true eloquence. But &s;ure it is equally po&s;&s;ible to apply the principles of rea&s;on and good &s;en&s;e to this art, as to any other that is cultivated among men. If the following Lectures have any merit, it will con&s;i&s;t in an endeavour to &s;ub|&s;titute the application of the&s;e principles in the place of artificial and &s;chola&s;tic rhetoric; in an endeavour to explode fal&s;e ornament,
<PB N="4" REF="10">
to direct attention more towards &s;ub&s;tance than &s;how, to recommend good &s;en&s;e as the foundation of all good compo&s;ition, and &s;im|plicity as e&s;&s;ential to all true ornament.</P>
<P>WHEN entering on the &s;ubject, I may be allowed, on this occa&s;ion, to &s;ugge&s;t a few thoughts concerning the importance and ad|vantages of &s;uch &s;tudies, and the rank they are intitled to po&s;&s;e&s;s in academical educa|tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Author was the fir&s;t who read Lectures on this &s;ub|ject in the Univer&s;ity of Edinburgh. He began with reading them in a private character in the year 1759. In the follow|ing year he was cho&s;en Profe&s;&s;or of Rhetoric by the Magi&s;trates and Town-council of Edinburgh: and, in 1762, his Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to erect and endow a Profe&s;&s;ion of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres in that Univer&s;ity; and the Author was ap|pointed the fir&s;t Regius Profe&s;&s;or.</NOTE>. I am under no temptation, for this purpo&s;e, of extolling their importance at the expence of any other department of &s;cience. On the contrary, the &s;tudy of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres &s;uppo&s;es and requires a proper acquaintance with the re&s;t of the liberal arts. It embraces them all within its circle, and recommends them to the highe&s;t regard. The fir&s;t care of all &s;uch as wi&s;h either to write with reputation, or to &s;peak in public &s;o as to command attention, mu&s;t be, to ex|tend their knowledge; to lay in a rich &s;tore of ideas relating to tho&s;e &s;ubjects of which the occa&s;ions of life may call them to di&s;|cour&s;e or to write. Hence, among the an|cients, it was a fundamental principle, and frequently inculcated, <Q REND="inline">"Quod omnibus di&s;|ciplinis
<PB N="5" REF="11">
et artibus debet e&s;&s;e in&s;tructus ora|tor;"</Q> that the orator ought to be an ac|compli&s;hed &s;cholar, and conver&s;ant in every part of learning. It is indeed impo&s;&s;ible to contrive an art, and very pernicious it were if it could be contrived, which &s;hould give the &s;tamp of merit to any compo&s;ition rich or &s;plendid in expre&s;&s;ion, but barren or er|roneous in thought. They are the wretch|ed attempts towards an art of this kind which have &s;o often di&s;graced oratory, and deba&s;ed it below its true &s;tandard. The graces of compo&s;ition have been em|ployed to di&s;gui&s;e or to &s;upply the want of matter; and the temporary applau&s;e of the ignorant has been courted, in&s;tead of the la&s;ting approbation of the di&s;cerning. But &s;uch impo&s;ture can never maintain its ground long. Knowledge and &s;cience mu&s;t furni&s;h the materials that form the body and &s;ub|&s;tance of any valuable compo&s;ition. Rhe|toric &s;erves to add the poli&s;h; and we know that none but firm and &s;olid bodies can be poli&s;hed well.</P>
<P>OF tho&s;e who peru&s;e the following Lec|tures, &s;ome, by the profe&s;&s;ion to which they addict them&s;elves, or in con&s;equence of their prevailing inclination, may have the view of being employed in compo&s;ition, or in public &s;peaking. Others, without any pro&s;pect of this kind, may wi&s;h only to improve their ta&s;te with re&s;pect to writing and di&s;cour&s;e, and to acquire principles which will enable
<PB N="6" REF="12">
them to judge for them&s;elves in that part of literature called the Belles Lettres.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to the former, &s;uch as may have occa&s;ion to communicate their &s;enti|ments to the Public, it is abundantly clear that &s;ome preparation of &s;tudy is requi&s;ite for the end which they have in view. To &s;peak or to write per&s;picuou&s;ly and agreea|bly, with purity, with grace and &s;trength, are attainments of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to all who purpo&s;e, either by &s;peech or writing, to addre&s;s the Public. For without being ma&s;ter of tho&s;e attainments, no man can do ju&s;tice to his own conceptions; but how rich &s;oever he may be in knowledge and in good &s;en&s;e, will be able to avail him&s;elf le&s;s of tho&s;e trea&s;ures, than &s;uch as po&s;&s;e&s;s not half his &s;tore, but who can di&s;play what they po&s;&s;e&s;s with more propriety. Neither are the&s;e attainments of that kind for which we are indebted to nature merely. Nature has, indeed, conferred upon &s;ome a very favour|able di&s;tinction in this re&s;pect, beyond others. But in the&s;e, as in mo&s;t other talents &s;he be&s;tows, &s;he has left much to be wrought out by every man's own indu&s;try. So con&s;picu|ous have been the effects of &s;tudy and im|provement in every part of eloquence; &s;uch remarkable examples have appeared of per|&s;ons &s;urmounting, by their diligence, the di&s;|advantages of the mo&s;t untoward nature, that among the learned it has long been a con|te&s;ted, and remains &s;till an undecided point,
<PB N="7" REF="13">
whether nature or art confer mo&s;t towards excelling in writing and di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to the manner in which art can mo&s;t effectually furni&s;h a&s;&s;i&s;tance for &s;uch a purpo&s;e, there may be diver&s;ity of opinions. I by no means pretend to &s;ay that mere rhetorical rules, how ju&s;t &s;oever, are &s;ufficient to form an orator. Suppo&s;ing natural genius to be favourable, more by a great deal will depend upon private applica|tion and &s;tudy, than upon any &s;y&s;tem of in|&s;truction that is capable of being publicly communicated. But at the &s;ame time, though rules and in&s;tructions cannot do all that is requi&s;ite, they may, however, do much that is of real u&s;e. They cannot, it is true, in&s;pire genius; but they can direct and a&s;&s;i&s;t it. They cannot remedy barren|ne&s;s; but they may correct redundancy. They point out proper models for imitation. They bring into view the chief beauties that ought to be &s;tudied, and the principal faults that ought to be avoided; and thereby tend to enlighten ta&s;te, and to lead genius from unnatural deviations, into its proper chan|nel. What would not avail for the produc|tion of great excellencies, may at lea&s;t &s;erve to prevent the commi&s;&s;ion of con&s;iderable errors.</P>
<P>ALL that regards the &s;tudy of eloquence and compo&s;ition, merits the higher attention upon this account, that it is intimately con|nected
<PB N="8" REF="14">
with the improvement of our intel|lectual powers. For I mu&s;t be allowed to &s;ay, that when we are employed, after a proper manner, in the &s;tudy of compo&s;ition, we are cultivating rea&s;on it&s;elf. True rhe|toric and &s;ound logic are very nearly allied. The &s;tudy of arranging and expre&s;&s;ing our thoughts with propriety, teaches to think, as well as to &s;peak, accurately. By putting our &s;entiments into words, we always con|ceive them more di&s;tinctly. Every one who has the &s;lighte&s;t acquaintance with compo&s;i|tion knows, that when he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf ill on any &s;ubject, when his arrangement becomes loo&s;e, and his &s;entences turn feeble, the defects of his &s;tyle can, almo&s;t on every occa&s;ion, be traced back to his indi&s;tinct conception of the &s;ubject: &s;o clo&s;e is the connection between thoughts and the words in which they are clothed.</P>
<P>THE &s;tudy of compo&s;ition, important in it&s;elf at all times, has acquired additional importance from the ta&s;te and manners of the pre&s;ent age. It is an age wherein im|provements, in every part of &s;cience, have been pro&s;ecuted with ardour. To all the liberal arts much attention has been paid; and to none more than to the beauty of lan|guage, and the grace and elegance of every kind of writing. The public ear is become refined. It will not ea&s;ily bear what is &s;lo|venly and incorrect. Every author mu&s;t a&s;pire to &s;ome merit in expre&s;&s;ion, as well
<PB N="9" REF="15">
as in &s;entiment, if he would not incur the danger of being neglected and de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P>I WILL not deny that the love of minute elegance, and attention to inferior ornaments of compo&s;ition, may at pre&s;ent have en|gro&s;&s;ed too great a degree of the public re|gard. It is indeed my opinion, that we lean to this extreme; often more careful of po|li&s;hing &s;tyle, than of &s;toring it with thought. Yet hence ari&s;es a new rea&s;on for the &s;tudy of ju&s;t and proper compo&s;ition. If it be re|qui&s;ite not to be deficient in elegance or or|nament in times when they are in &s;uch high e&s;timation, it is &s;till more requi&s;ite to attain the power of di&s;tingui&s;hing fal&s;e ornament from true, in order to prevent our being carried away by that torrent of fal&s;e and fri|volous ta&s;te, which never fails, when it is prevalent, to &s;weep along with it the raw and the ignorant. They who have never &s;tudied eloquence in its principles, nor have been trained to attend to the genuine and manly beauties of good writing, are always ready to be caught by the mere glare of lan|guage; and when they come to &s;peak in public, or to compo&s;e, have no other &s;tan|dard on which to form them&s;elves, except what chances to be fa&s;hionable and popular, how corrupted &s;oever, or erroneous, that may be.</P>
<P>BUT as there are many who have no &s;uch objects as either compo&s;ition or public &s;peak|ing
<PB N="10" REF="16">
in view, let us next con&s;ider what ad|vantages may be derived by them, from &s;uch &s;tudies as form the &s;ubject of the&s;e Lectures. To them, rhetoric is not &s;o much a practical art as a &s;peculative &s;cience; and the &s;ame in&s;tructions which a&s;&s;i&s;t others in compo&s;ing, will a&s;&s;i&s;t them in judging of, and reli&s;hing, the beauties of compo&s;ition. Whatever en|ables genius to execute well, will enable ta&s;te to critici&s;e ju&s;tly.</P>
<P>WHEN we name critici&s;ing, prejudices may perhaps ari&s;e, of the &s;ame kind with tho&s;e which I mentioned before with re&s;pect to rhetoric. As rhetoric has been &s;ometimes thought to &s;ignify nothing more than the &s;chola&s;tic &s;tudy of words, and phra&s;es, and tropes, &s;o critici&s;m has been con&s;idered as merely the art of finding faults; as the fri|gid application of certain technical terms, by means of which per&s;ons are taught to cavil and cen&s;ure in a learned manner. But this is the critici&s;m of pedants only. True criti|ci&s;m is a liberal and humane art. It is the offspring of good &s;en&s;e and refined ta&s;te. It aims at acquiring a ju&s;t di&s;cernment of the real merit of authors. It promotes a lively reli&s;h of their beauties, while it pre&s;erves us from that blind and implicit veneration which would confound their beauties and faults in our e&s;teem. It teaches us, in a word, to ad|mire and to blame with judgment, and not to follow the crowd blindly.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="17">
IN an age when works of genius and lite|rature are &s;o frequently the &s;ubjects of di&s;|cour&s;e, when every one erects him&s;elf into a judge, and when we can hardly mingle in po|lite &s;ociety without bearing &s;ome &s;hare in &s;uch di&s;cu&s;&s;ions; &s;tudies of this kind, it is not to be doubted, will appear to derive part of their importance from the u&s;e to which they may be applied in furni&s;hing materials for tho&s;e fa&s;hionable topics of di&s;cour&s;e, and thereby enabling us to &s;upport a proper rank in &s;ocial life.</P>
<P>BUT I &s;hould be &s;orry if we could not re&s;t the merit of &s;uch &s;tudies on &s;omewhat of &s;o|lid and intrin&s;ical u&s;e independent of appear|ance and &s;how. The exerci&s;e of ta&s;te and of &s;ound critici&s;m, is in truth one of the mo&s;t improving employments of the under&s;tanding. To apply the principles of good &s;en&s;e to com|po&s;ition and di&s;cour&s;e; to examine what is beautiful, and why it is &s;o; to employ our|&s;elves in di&s;tingui&s;hing accurately between the &s;pecious and the &s;olid, between affected and natural ornament, mu&s;t certainly im|prove us not a little in the mo&s;t valuable part of all philo&s;ophy, the philo&s;ophy of human nature. For &s;uch di&s;qui&s;itions are very inti|mately connected with the knowledge of our|&s;elves. They nece&s;&s;arily lead us to reflect on the operations of the imagination, and the movements of the heart; and increa&s;e our acquaintance with &s;ome of the mo&s;t refined feelings which belong to our frame.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="18">
LOGICAL and Ethical di&s;qui&s;itions move in a higher &s;phere; and are conver&s;ant with objects of a more &s;evere kind; the progre&s;s of the under&s;tanding in its &s;earch after know|ledge, and the direction of the will in the proper pur&s;uit of good. In the&s;e they point out to man the improvement of his nature as an intelligent being; and his duties as the &s;ubject of moral obligation. Belles Lettres and critici&s;m chiefly con&s;ider him as a Being endowed with tho&s;e powers of ta&s;te and ima|gination, which were intended to embelli&s;h his mind, and to &s;upply him with rational and u&s;eful entertainment. They open a field of inve&s;tigation peculiar to them&s;elves. All that relates to beauty, harmony, gran|deur, and elegance; all that can &s;ooth the mind, gratify the fancy, or move the affecti|ons, belongs to their province. They pre|&s;ent human nature under a different a&s;pect from that which it a&s;&s;umes to the view of other &s;ciences. They bring to light various &s;prings of action which without their aid might have pa&s;&s;ed unob&s;erved; and which, though of a delicate nature, frequently exert a powerful influence on &s;everal departments of human life.</P>
<P>SUCH &s;tudies have al&s;o this peculiar advan|tage, that they exerci&s;e our rea&s;on without fatiguing it. They lead to enquiries acute, but not painful; profound, but not dry nor ab&s;tru&s;e. They &s;trew flowers in the path of &s;cience; and while they keep the mind bent,
<PB N="13" REF="19">
in &s;ome degree, and active, they relieve it at the &s;ame time from that more toil&s;ome labour to which it mu&s;t &s;ubmit in the acqui&s;ition of nece&s;&s;ary erudition, or the inve&s;tigation of ab&s;tract truth.</P>
<P>THE cultivation of ta&s;te is farther recom|mended by the happy effects which it natu|rally tends to produce on human life. The mo&s;t bu&s;y man, in the mo&s;t active &s;phere, cannot be always occupied by bu&s;ine&s;s. Men of &s;erious profe&s;&s;ions cannot always be on the &s;tretch of &s;erious thought. Neither can the mo&s;t gay and flouri&s;hing &s;ituations of fortune afford any man the power of filling all his hours with plea&s;ure. Life mu&s;t al|ways langui&s;h in the hands of the idle. It will frequently langui&s;h even in the hands of the bu&s;y, if they have not &s;ome employment &s;ub&s;idiary to that which forms their main pur&s;uit. How then &s;hall the&s;e vacant &s;paces, tho&s;e unemployed intervals, which, more or le&s;s, occur in the life of every one, be filled up? How can we contrive to di&s;po&s;e of them in any way that &s;hall be more agreeable in it&s;elf, or more con&s;onant to the dignity of the human mind, than in the entertainments of ta&s;te, and the &s;tudy of polite literature? He who is &s;o happy as to have acquired a re|li&s;h for the&s;e, has always at hand an inno|cent and irreproachable amu&s;ement for his lei&s;ure hours, to &s;ave him from the danger of many a pernicious pa&s;&s;ion. He is not in ha|zard of being a burden to him&s;elf. He is not
<PB N="14" REF="20">
obliged to fly to low company, or to court the riot of loo&s;e plea&s;ures, in order to cure the tediou&s;ne&s;s of exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>PROVIDENCE &s;eems plainly to have point|ed out this u&s;eful purpo&s;e to which the plea|&s;ures of ta&s;te may be applied, by interpo&s;ing them in a middle &s;tation between the plea|&s;ures of &s;en&s;e, and tho&s;e of pure intellect. We were not de&s;igned to grovel always among objects &s;o low as the former; nor are we capable of dwelling con&s;tantly in &s;o high a region as the latter. The plea&s;ures of ta&s;te refre&s;h the mind after the toils of the intel|lect, and the labours of ab&s;tract &s;tudy; and they gradually rai&s;e it above the attachments of &s;en&s;e, and prepare it for the enjoyments of virtue.</P>
<P>SO con&s;onant is this to experience, that in the education of youth, no object has in every age appeared more important to wi&s;e men, than to tincture them early with a re|li&s;h for the entertainments of ta&s;te. The tran&s;ition is commonly made with ea&s;e from the&s;e to the di&s;charge of the higher and more important duties of life. Good hopes may be entertained of tho&s;e who&s;e minds have this liberal and elegant turn. Many virtues may be grafted upon it. Whereas to be en|tirely devoid of reli&s;h for eloquence, poetry, or any of the fine arts, is ju&s;tly con&s;tructed to be an unpromi&s;ing &s;ymptom of youth; and rai&s;es &s;u&s;picions of their being prone to
<PB N="15" REF="21">
low gratifications, or de&s;tined to drudge in the more vulgar and illiberal pur&s;uits of life.</P>
<P>THERE are indeed few good di&s;po&s;itions of any kind with which the improvement of ta&s;te is not more or le&s;s connected. A cul|tivated ta&s;te increa&s;es &s;en&s;ibility to all the tender and humane pa&s;&s;ions, by giving them frequent exerci&s;e; while it tends to weaken the more violent and fierce emotions.

The elevated &s;entiments and high examples which poetry, eloquence and hi&s;tory are often bringing under our view, naturally tend to nouri&s;h in our minds public &s;pirit, the love of glory, contempt of external fortune, and the admiration of what is truly illu&s;trious and great.</P>
<P>I WILL not go &s;o far as to &s;ay that the improvement of ta&s;te and of virtue is the &s;ame; or that they may always be expected to coexi&s;t in an equal degree. More power|ful correctives than ta&s;te can apply, are ne|ce&s;&s;ary for reforming the corrupt propen&s;i|ties which too frequently prevail among man|kind. Elegant &s;peculations are &s;ometimes
<PB N="16" REF="22">
found to float on the &s;urface of the mind, while bad pa&s;&s;ions po&s;&s;e&s;s the interior regi|ons of the heart. At the &s;ame time this cannot but be admitted, that the exerci&s;e of ta&s;te is, in its native tendency, moral and purifying. From reading the mo&s;t admired productions of genius, whether in poetry or pro&s;e, almo&s;t every one ri&s;es with &s;ome good impre&s;&s;ions left on his mind; and though the&s;e may not always be durable, they are at lea&s;t to be ranked among the means of di&s;|po&s;ing the heart to virtue. One thing is certain, and I &s;hall hereafter have occa&s;ion to illu&s;trate it more fully, that without po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing the virtuous affections in a &s;trong de|gree, no man can attain eminence in the &s;ublime parts of eloquence. He mu&s;t feel what a good man feels, if he expects greatly to move or to intere&s;t mankind. They are the ardent &s;entiments of honour, virtue, magnanimity, and publick &s;pirit, that only can kindle that fire of genius, and call up into the mind tho&s;e high ideas, which attract the admiration of ages; and if this &s;pirit be nece&s;&s;ary to produce the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed efforts of eloquence, it mu&s;t be nece&s;&s;ary al&s;o to our reli&s;hing them with proper ta&s;te and feeling.</P>

<P>THE nature of the pre&s;ent undertaking leads me to begin with &s;ome enquiries concerning Ta&s;te, as it is this faculty which is always appealed to in di&s;qui&s;itions concern|ing the merit of di&s;cour&s;e and writing.</P>
<P>THERE are few &s;ubjects on which men talk more loo&s;ely and indi&s;tinctly than on Ta&s;te; few which it is more difficult to ex|plain with preci&s;ion; and none which in this Cour&s;e of Lectures will appear more dry or ab&s;tract. What I have to &s;ay on the &s;ubject &s;hall be in the following order. I &s;hall fir&s;t explain the Nature of Ta&s;te as a power or faculty in the human mind. I &s;hall next con&s;ider how far it is an improveable faculty. I &s;hall &s;hew the &s;ources of its improvement, and the characters of ta&s;te in its mo&s;t perfect &s;tate. I &s;hall then examine the various fluc|tuations to which it is liable, and enquire
<PB N="19" REF="25">
whether there be any &s;tandard to which we can bring the different ta&s;tes of men, in or|der to di&s;tingui&s;h the corrupted from the true.</P>
<P>TASTE may be defined <Q REND="inline">"The power of receiving plea&s;ure from the beauties of na|ture and of art."</Q> The fir&s;t que&s;tion that occurs concerning it is, whether it is to be con&s;idered as an internal &s;en&s;e, or as an exer|tion of rea&s;on? Rea&s;on is a very general term; but if we under&s;tand by it, that pow|er of the mind which in &s;peculative matters di&s;covers truth, and in practical matters judges of the fitne&s;s of means to an end, I apprehend the que&s;tion may be ea&s;ily an|&s;wered. For nothing can be more clear, than that ta&s;te is not re&s;olveable into any &s;uch operation of Rea&s;on. It is not merely through a di&s;covery of the under&s;tanding or a deduc|tion of argument, that the mind receives plea|&s;ure from a beautiful pro&s;pect or a fine poem. Such objects often &s;trike us intuitively, and make a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion when we are un|able to a&s;&s;ign the rea&s;ons of our being plea&s;|ed. They &s;ometimes &s;trike in the &s;ame man|ner the philo&s;opher and the pea&s;ant; the boy and the man. Hence the faculty by which we reli&s;h &s;uch beauties, &s;eems more a-kin to a feeling of &s;en&s;e, than to a proce&s;s of the under&s;tanding: and accordingly from an ex|ternal &s;en&s;e it has borrowed its name; that &s;en&s;e by which we receive and di&s;tingui&s;h the plea&s;ures of food having, in &s;everal lan|guages,

However, as in all &s;ubjects which regard the operations of the mind, the inac|curate u&s;e of words is to be carefully avoid|ed, it mu&s;t not be inferred from what I have &s;aid, that rea&s;on is excluded from the exer|tions of ta&s;te. Though ta&s;te, beyond doubt, be ultimately founded on a certain natural and in&s;tinctive &s;en&s;ibility to beauty, yet rea|&s;on, as I &s;hall &s;hew hereafter, a&s;&s;i&s;ts Ta&s;te in many of its operations, and &s;erves to enlarge its power<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Se Dr. Gerard's E&s;&s;ay on Ta&s;te.&mdash;D'Alembert's Reflecti|ons on the u&s;e and abu&s;e of philo&s;ophy in matters which relate to Ta&s;te:&mdash;Reflexions Critiques &s;ur la po&euml;&s;ie et &s;ur la peinture, Tom II. ch. 22&mdash;31.

<P>TASTE, in the &s;en&s;e in which I have ex|plained it, is a faculty common in &s;ome de|gree to all men. Nothing that belongs to human nature is more univer&s;al than the re|li&s;h of beauty of one kind or other; of what is orderly, proportioned, grand, harmonious, new, or &s;prightly. In children, the rudiments of Ta&s;te di&s;cover them&s;elves very early in a thou&s;and in&s;tances; in their fondne&s;s for re|gular bodies, their admiration of pictures and &s;tatues, and imitations of all kinds; and their &s;trong attachment to whatever is new or marvellous. The mo&s;t ignorant pea&s;ants are delighted with ballads and tales, and are
<PB N="21" REF="27">
&s;truck with the beautiful appearances of na|ture in the earth and heavens. Even in the de&s;arts of America, where human nature &s;hews it&s;elf in its mo&s;t uncultivated &s;tate, the &s;a|vages have their ornaments of dre&s;s, their war and their death &s;ongs, their harangues, and their orators. We mu&s;t therefore conclude the principles of Ta&s;te to be deeply founded in the human mind. It is no le&s;s e&s;&s;ential to man to have &s;ome di&s;cernment of beauty, than it is to po&s;&s;e&s;s the attributes of rea&s;on and of &s;peech<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the &s;ubject of Ta&s;te con&s;idered as a power or faculty of the mind, much le&s;s is to be found among the antient, than among the modern rhetorical and critical writers.

BUT although none be wholly devoid of this faculty, yet the degrees in which it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed are widely different. In &s;ome men only the feeble glimmerings of Ta&s;te appear; the beauties which they reli&s;h are of the coar&s;e&s;t kind; and of the&s;e they have but a weak and confu&s;ed impre&s;&s;ion: while in others, Ta&s;te ri&s;es to an acute di&s;cernment, and a lively enjoyment of the mo&s;t refined beauties. In general, we may ob&s;erve, that in the powers and plea&s;ures of Ta&s;te, there is a more remarkable inequality among men than is u&s;ually found in point of common &s;en&s;e, rea&s;on, and judgment. The con&s;titu|tion of our nature in this, as in all other re&s;|pects, di&s;covers admirable wi&s;dom. In the di&s;tribution of tho&s;e talents which are nece&s;|&s;ary for man's well-being, Nature hath made le&s;s di&s;tinction among her children. But in the di&s;tribution of tho&s;e which belong only to the ornamental part of life, &s;he hath be&s;tow|ed her favours with more frugality. She hath both &s;own the &s;eeds more &s;paringly; and rendered a higher culture requi&s;ite for bringing them to perfection.</P>
<P>THIS inequality of Ta&s;te among men is owing, without doubt, in part, to the differ|ent frame of their natures; to nicer organs, and finer internal powers, with which &s;ome are endowed beyond others. But, if it be owing in part to nature, it is owing to edu|cation and culture &s;till more. The illu&s;tra|tion of this leads to my next remark on this
<PB N="23" REF="29">
&s;ubject, that Ta&s;te is a mo&s;t improveable fa|culty, if there be any &s;uch in human nature; a remark which gives great encouragement to &s;uch a cour&s;e of &s;tudy as we are now pro|po&s;ing to pur&s;ue. Of the truth of this a&s;&s;er|tion we may ea&s;ily be convinced, by only reflecting on that immen&s;e &s;uperiority which education and improvement give to civilized, above barbarous nations, in refinement of Ta&s;te; and on the &s;uperiority which they give in the &s;ame nation to tho&s;e who have &s;tudied the liberal arts, above the rude and untaught vulgar. The difference is &s;o great, that there is perhaps no one particular in which the&s;e two cla&s;&s;es of men are &s;o far removed from each other, as in re&s;pect of the powers and the plea&s;ures of Ta&s;te: and a&s;&s;uredly for this difference no other general cau&s;e can be a&s;&s;igned, but culture and edu|cation.&mdash;I &s;hall now proceed to &s;hew what the means are, by which Ta&s;te becomes &s;o remarkably &s;u&s;ceptible of cultivation and progre&s;s.</P>
<P>REFLECT fir&s;t upon that great law of our nature, that exerci&s;e is the chief &s;ource of improvement in all our faculties. This holds both in our bodily, and in our mental powers. It holds even in our external &s;en&s;es; although the&s;e be le&s;s the &s;ubject of cultivation than any of our other faculties. We &s;ee how acute the &s;en&s;es become in per|&s;ons who&s;e trade or bu&s;ine&s;s leads to nice ex|ertions of them. Touch, for in&s;tance, be|comes
<PB N="24" REF="30">
infinitely more exqui&s;ite in men who&s;e employment requires them to examine the poli&s;h of bodies, than it is in others. They who deal in micro&s;copical ob&s;ervations, or are accu&s;tomed to engrave on precious &s;tones, acquire &s;urpri&s;ing accuracy of &s;ight in di&s;|cerning the minute&s;t objects; and practice in attending to different flavours and ta&s;tes of liquors, wonderfully improves the power of di&s;tingui&s;hing them, and of tracing their compo&s;ition. Placing internal Ta&s;te there|fore on the footing of a &s;imple &s;en&s;e, it can|not be doubted that frequent exerci&s;e, and curious attention to its proper objects, mu&s;t greatly heighten its power. Of this we have one clear proof in that part of Ta&s;te, which is called an ear for mu&s;ic. Experience every days &s;hews, that nothing is more improvea|ble. Only the &s;imple&s;t and plaine&s;t compo|&s;itions are reli&s;hed at fir&s;t; u&s;e and practice extend our plea&s;ure; teach us to reli&s;h finer melody, and by degrees enable us to enter into the intricate and compounded plea&s;ures of harmony. So an eye for the beauties of painting is never all at once acquired. It is gradually formed by being conver&s;ant among pictures, and &s;tudying the works of the be&s;t ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>PRECISELY in the &s;ame manner, with re|&s;pect to the beauty of compo&s;ition and di&s;|cour&s;e, attention to the mo&s;t approved mo|dels, &s;tudy of the be&s;t authors, compari&s;ons of lower and higher degrees of the &s;ame
<PB N="25" REF="31">
beauties, operate towards the refinement of Ta&s;te. When one is only beginning his ac|quaintance with works of genius, the &s;enti|ment which attends them is ob&s;cure and con|fu&s;ed. He cannot point out the &s;everal ex|cellencies or blemi&s;hes of a performance which he peru&s;es; he is at a lo&s;s on what to re&s;t his judgment; all that can be expected is, that he &s;hould tell in general whether he be plea&s;ed or not. But allow him more ex|perience in works of this kind, and his Ta&s;te becomes by degrees more exact and enlight|ened. He begins to perceive not only the character of the whole, but the beauties and defects of each part; and is able to de&s;cribe the peculiar qualities which he prai&s;es or blames. The mi&s;t di&s;&s;ipates which &s;eemed formerly to hang over the object; and he can at length pronounce firmly, and without he&s;itation, concerning it. Thus in Ta&s;te, con&s;idered as mere &s;en&s;ibility, exerci&s;e opens a great &s;ource of improvement.</P>
<P>BUT although Ta&s;te be ultimately found|ed on &s;en&s;ibility, it mu&s;t not be con&s;idered as in&s;tinctive &s;en&s;ibility alone. Rea&s;on and good &s;en&s;e, as I before hinted, have &s;o ex|ten&s;ive an influence on all the operations and deci&s;ions of Ta&s;te, that a thorough good Ta&s;te may well be con&s;idered as a power compounded of natural &s;en&s;ibility to beauty, and of improved under&s;tanding. In order to be &s;atisfied of this, let us ob&s;erve, that the greater part of the productions of ge|nius
<PB N="26" REF="32">
are no other than imitations of nature; repre&s;entations of the characters, actions, or manners of men. The plea&s;ure we receive from &s;uch imitations or repre&s;entations is founded on mere Ta&s;te: but to judge whe|ther they be properly executed, belongs to the under&s;tanding, which compares the copy with the original.</P>
<P>IN reading, for in&s;tance, &s;uch a poem as the Aeneid, a great part of our plea&s;ure ari&s;es from the plan or &s;tory being well conducted, and all the parts joined together with proba|bility and due connexion; from the charac|ters being taken from nature, the &s;entiments being &s;uited to the characters, and the &s;tyle to the &s;entiments. The plea&s;ure which ari&s;es from a poem &s;o conducted, is felt or enjoyed by Ta&s;te as an internal &s;en&s;e; but the di&s;co|very of this conduct in the poem is owing to rea&s;on; and the more that rea&s;on enables us to di&s;cover &s;uch propriety in the conduct, the greater will be our plea&s;ure. We are plea&s;ed, through our natural &s;en&s;e of beau|ty. Rea&s;on &s;hews us why, and upon what grounds, we are plea&s;ed. Wherever in works of Ta&s;te, any re&s;emblance to nature is aimed at; wherever there is any reference of parts to a whole, or of means to an end, as there is indeed in almo&s;t every writing and di&s;cour&s;e, there the under&s;tanding mu&s;t al|ways have a great part to act.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="33">
HERE then is a wide field for rea&s;on's ex|erting its powers in relation to the objects of Ta&s;te, particularly with re&s;pect to compo&s;i|tion, and works of genius; and hence ari&s;es a &s;econd and a very con&s;iderable &s;ource of the improvement of Ta&s;te, from the appli|cation of rea&s;on and good &s;en&s;e to &s;uch pro|ductions of genius. Spurious beauties, &s;uch as unnatural characters, forced &s;entiments, affected &s;tyle, may plea&s;e for a little; but they plea&s;e only becau&s;e their oppo&s;ition to nature and to good &s;en&s;e has not been exa|mined, or attended to. Once &s;hew how na|ture might have been more ju&s;tly imitated or repre&s;ented: how the writer might have ma|naged his &s;ubject to greater advantage; the illu&s;ion will pre&s;ently be di&s;&s;ipated, and tho&s;e fal&s;e beauties will plea&s;e no more.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e two &s;ources then, fir&s;t, the frequent exerci&s;e of Ta&s;te, and next the ap|plication of good &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on to the ob|jects of Ta&s;te, Ta&s;te as a power of the mind receives its improvement. In its perfect &s;tate, it is undoubtedly the re&s;ult both of nature and of art. It &s;uppo&s;es our natural &s;en&s;e of beauty to be refined by frequent attention to the mo&s;t beautiful objects, and at the &s;ame time to be guided and improved by the light of the under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>I MUST be allowed to add, that as a &s;ound head, &s;o likewi&s;e a good heart, is a very ma|terial requi&s;ite to ju&s;t Ta&s;te. The moral
<PB N="28" REF="34">
beauties are not only in them&s;elves &s;uperiour to all others, but they exert an influence, either more near or more remote, on a great variety of other objects of Ta&s;te. Wherever the affections, characters, or actions of men are concerned (and the&s;e certainly afford the noble&s;t &s;ubjects to genius), there can be nei|ther any ju&s;t or affecting de&s;cription of them, nor any thorough feeling of the beauty of that de&s;cription, without our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the virtuous affections. He who&s;e heart is in|delicate or hard, he who has no admiration of what is truly noble or prai&s;eworthy, nor the proper &s;ympathetic &s;en&s;e of what is &s;oft and tender, mu&s;t have a very imperfect re|li&s;h of the highe&s;t beauties of eloquence and poetry.</P>
<P>THE characters of Ta&s;te when brought to its mo&s;t perfect &s;tate are all reducible to two, Delicacy and Correctne&s;s.</P>
<P>DELICACY of Ta&s;te re&s;pects principally the perfection of that natural &s;en&s;ibility on which Ta&s;te is founded. It implies tho&s;e finer organs or powers which enable us to di&s;cover beauties that lie hid from a vulgar eye. One may have &s;trong &s;en&s;ibility, and yet be deficient in delicate Ta&s;te. He may be deeply impre&s;&s;ed by &s;uch beauties as he perceives; but he perceives only what is in &s;ome degree coar&s;e, what is bold and palpa|ble; while cha&s;ter and &s;impler ornaments e&s;cape his notice. In this &s;tate Ta&s;te gene|rally
<PB N="29" REF="35">
exi&s;ts among rude and unrefined nati|ons. But a per&s;on of delicate Ta&s;te both feels &s;trongly, and feels accurately. He &s;ees di&s;tinctions and differences where others &s;ee none; the mo&s;t latent beauty does not e&s;cape him, and he is &s;en&s;ible of the &s;malle&s;t ble|mi&s;h. Delicacy of Ta&s;te is judged of by the &s;ame marks that we u&s;e in judging of the delicacy of an external &s;en&s;e. As the good|ne&s;s of the palate is not tried by &s;trong fla|vours, but by a mixture of ingredients, where, notwith&s;tanding the confu&s;ion, we remain &s;en&s;ible of each; in like manner de|licacy of internal Ta&s;te appears, by a quick and lively &s;en&s;ibility to its fine&s;t, mo&s;t com|pounded, or mo&s;t latent objects.</P>
<P>CORRECTNESS of Ta&s;te re&s;pects chiefly the improvement which that faculty receives through its connexion with the under&s;tand|ing. A man of correct Ta&s;te is one who is never impo&s;ed on by counterfeit beauties; who carries always in his mind that &s;tandard of good &s;en&s;e which he employs in judging of every thing. He e&s;timates with propriety the comparative merit of the &s;everal beauties which he meets with in any work of genius; refers them to their proper cla&s;&s;es; a&s;&s;igns the principles, as far as they can be traced, whence their power of plea&s;ing us flows; and is plea&s;ed him&s;elf preci&s;ely in that de|gree in which he ought, and no more.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="36">
IT is true that the&s;e two qualities of Ta&s;te, Delicacy and Correctne&s;s, mutually imply each other. No Ta&s;te can be exqui&s;itely de|licate without being correct; nor can be tho|roughly correct without being delicate. But &s;till a predominancy of one or other quality in the mixture is often vi&s;ible. The power of Delicacy is chiefly &s;een in di&s;cerning the true merit of a work; the power of Correct|ne&s;s, in rejecting fal&s;e preten&s;ions to merit. Delicacy leans more to feeling; Correctne&s;s more to rea&s;on and judgment. The former is more the gift of nature; the latter, more the product of culture and art. Among the antient critics, Longinus po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed mo&s;t Deli|cacy; Ari&s;totle, mo&s;t Correctne&s;s. Among the moderns, Mr. Addi&s;on is a high example of delicate Ta&s;te; Dean Swift, had he writ|ten on the &s;ubject of critici&s;m, would per|haps have afforded the example of a correct one.</P>
<P>HAVING viewed Ta&s;te in its mo&s;t improv|ed and perfect &s;tate, I come next to con&s;ider its deviations from that &s;tate, the fluctuati|ons and changes to which it is liable; and to enquire whether, in the mid&s;t of the&s;e, there be any means of di&s;tingui&s;hing a true from a corrupted Ta&s;te. This brings us to the mo&s;t difficult part of our ta&s;k. For it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that no principle of the human mind is, in its operations, more fluc|tuating and capricious than Ta&s;te. Its vari|ations have been &s;o great and frequent, as to
<PB N="31" REF="37">
create a &s;u&s;picion with &s;ome, of its being merely arbitrary; grounded on no founda|tion, a&s;certainable by no &s;tandard, but wholly dependent on changing fancy; the con&s;e|quence of which would be, that all &s;tudies or regular enquiries concerning the objects of Ta&s;te were vain. In architecture, the Grecian models were long e&s;teemed the mo&s;t perfect. In &s;ucceeding ages, the Gothic architecture alone prevailed, and afterwards the Grecian Ta&s;te revived in all its vigour, and engro&s;&s;ed the public admiration. In elo|quence and poetry, the A&s;iatics at no time reli&s;hed any thing but what was full of orna|ment, and &s;plendid in a degree that we would denominate gawdy; whil&s;t the Greeks ad|mired only cha&s;te and &s;imple beauties, and de&s;pi&s;ed the A&s;iatic o&s;tentation. In our own country, how many writings that were great|ly extolled two or three centuries ago, are now fallen into entire di&s;repute and oblivi|on? Without going back to remote in&s;tances, how very different is the ta&s;te of poetry which prevails in Great Britain now, from what pre|vailed there no longer ago than the reign of king Charles II. which the authors too of that time deemed an Augu&s;tan age: when nothing was in vogue but an affected bril|liancy of wit; when the &s;imple maje&s;ty of Milton was overlooked, and Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t almo&s;t entirely unknown; when Cowley's laboured and unnatural conceits were ad|mired as the very quinte&s;&s;ence of genius; Waller's gay &s;prightline&s;s was mi&s;taken for

<PB N="32" REF="38">
the tender &s;pirit of Love poetry; and &s;uch writers as Suckling and Etheridge were held in e&s;teem for dramatic compo&s;ition?</P>
<P>THE que&s;tion is, what conclu&s;ion we are to form from &s;uch in&s;tances as the&s;e? Is there any thing that can be called a &s;tandard of Ta&s;te, by appealing to which we may di&s;tin|gui&s;h between a good and a bad Ta&s;te? Or, is there in truth no &s;uch di&s;tinction; and are we to hold that, according to the proverb, there is no di&s;puting of Ta&s;tes; but that whatever plea&s;es is right, for that rea&s;on that it does plea&s;e? This is the que&s;tion, and a very nice and &s;ubtile one it is, which we are now to di&s;cu&s;s.</P>
<P>I BEGIN by ob&s;erving, that if there be no &s;uch thing as any &s;tandard of Ta&s;te, this con&s;equence mu&s;t immediately follow, that all Ta&s;tes are equally good; a po&s;ition, which though it may pa&s;s unnoticed in &s;light mat|ters, and when we &s;peak of the le&s;&s;er differ|ences among the Ta&s;tes of men, yet when we apply it to the extremes, its ab&s;urdity pre&s;ently becomes glaring. For is there any one who will &s;eriou&s;ly maintain that the Ta&s;te of a Hottentot or a Laplander is as delicate and as correct as that of a Longinus or an Addi&s;on? or, that he can be charged with no defect or incapacity who thinks a common news-writer as excellent an Hi&s;to|rian as Tacitus? As it would be held down|right extravagance to talk in this manner, we
<PB N="33" REF="39">
are led unavoidably to this conclu&s;ion, that there is &s;ome foundation for the preference of one man's Ta&s;te to that of another; or, that there is a good and a bad, right and a wrong in Ta&s;te, as in other things.</P>
<P>BUT to prevent mi&s;takes on this &s;ubject, it is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve next, that the di|ver&s;ity of Ta&s;tes which prevails among man|kind, does not in every ca&s;e infer corrup|tion of Ta&s;te, or oblige us to &s;eek for &s;ome &s;tandard in order to determine who are in the right. The Ta&s;tes of men may differ very con&s;iderably as to their object, and yet none of them be wrong. One man reli&s;hes Poetry mo&s;t; another takes plea&s;ure in no|thing but Hi&s;tory. One prefers Comedy; another, Tragedy. One admires the &s;imple; another, the ornamented &s;tyle. The young are amu&s;ed with gay and &s;prightly compo&s;i|tions. The elderly are more entertained with tho&s;e of a graver ca&s;t. Some nations delight in bold pictures of manners, and &s;trong repre&s;entations of pa&s;&s;ion. Others incline to more correct and regular elegance both in de&s;cription and &s;entiment. Though all differ, yet all pitch upon &s;ome one beau|ty which peculiarly &s;uits their turn of mind; and therefore no one has a title to condemn the re&s;t. It is not in matters of Ta&s;te, as in que&s;tions of mere rea&s;on, where there is but one conclu&s;ion that can be true, and all the re&s;t are erroneous. Truth, which is the object of rea&s;on, is one; Beauty, which is
<PB N="34" REF="40">
the object of Ta&s;te, is manifold. Ta&s;te therefore admits of latitude and diver&s;ity of objects, in &s;ufficient con&s;i&s;tency with good|ne&s;s or ju&s;tne&s;s of Ta&s;te.</P>
<P>BUT then, to explain this matter tho|roughly, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve farther, that this admi&s;&s;ible diver&s;ity of Ta&s;tes can only have place where the objects of Ta&s;te are differ|ent. Where it is with re&s;pect to the &s;ame object that men di&s;agree, when one con|demns that as ugly, which another admires as highly beautiful; then it is no longer di|ver&s;ity, but direct oppo&s;ition of Ta&s;te that takes place; and therefore one mu&s;t be in the right, and another in the wrong, unle&s;s that ab&s;urd paradox were allowed to hold, that all Ta&s;tes are equally good and true. One man prefers Virgil to Homer. Suppo&s;e that I, on the other hand, admire Homer more than Virgil. I have as yet no rea&s;on to &s;ay that our Ta&s;tes are contradictory. The other per&s;on is mo&s;t &s;truck with the elegance and tenderne&s;s which are the cha|racteri&s;tics of Virgil; I, with the &s;implicity and fire of Homer. As long as neither of us deny that both Homer and Virgil have great beauties, our difference falls within the compa&s;s of that diver&s;ity of Ta&s;tes, which I have &s;hewed to be natural and allowable. But if the other man &s;hall a&s;&s;ert that Ho|mer has no beauties whatever; that he holds him to be a dull and &s;piritle&s;s writer, and that he would as &s;oon peru&s;e any old legend
<PB N="35" REF="41">
of Knight-Errantry as the Iliad; then I ex|claim, that my antagoni&s;t either is void of all Ta&s;te, or that his Ta&s;te is corrupted in a mi&s;erable degree; and I appeal to whatever I think the &s;tandard of Ta&s;te, to &s;hew him that he is in the wrong.</P>
<P>WHAT that &s;tandard is, to which, in &s;uch oppo&s;ition of Ta&s;tes, we are obliged to have recour&s;e, remains to be traced. A &s;tandard properly &s;ignifies, that which is of &s;uch un|doubted authority as to be the te&s;t of other things of the &s;ame kind. Thus a &s;tandard weight or mea&s;ure, is that which is appoint|ed by law to regulate all other mea&s;ures and weights. Thus the court is &s;aid to be the &s;tandard of good breeding; and the &s;crip|ture, of theological truth.</P>
<P>WHEN we &s;ay that nature is the &s;tandard of Ta&s;te, we lay down a principle very true and ju&s;t, as far as it can be applied. There is no doubt, that in all ca&s;es where an imita|tion is intended of &s;ome object that exi&s;ts in nature, as in repre&s;enting human characters or actions, conformity to nature affords a full and di&s;tinct criterion of what is truly beautiful. Rea&s;on hath in &s;uch ca&s;es full &s;cope for exerting its authority; for approv|ing or condemning; by comparing the copy with the original. But there are innumera|ble ca&s;es in which this rule cannot be at all applied; and conformity to nature, is an expre&s;&s;ion frequently u&s;ed, without any di&s;|tinct
<PB N="36" REF="42">
or determinate meaning. We mu&s;t therefore &s;earch for &s;omewhat that can be rendered more clear and preci&s;e, to be the &s;tandard of Ta&s;te.</P>
<P>TASTE, as I before explained it, is ulti|mately founded on an internal &s;en&s;e of beau|ty, which is natural to men, and which, in its application to particular objects, is capa|ble of being guided and enlightened by rea|&s;on. Now, were there any one per&s;on who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in full perfection all the powers of human nature, who&s;e internal &s;en&s;es were in every in&s;tance exqui&s;ite and ju&s;t, and who&s;e rea&s;on was unerring and &s;ure, the determinations of &s;uch a per&s;on concerning beauty, would, beyond doubt, be a perfect &s;tandard for the Ta&s;te of all others. Where|ever their Ta&s;te differed from his, it could be imputed only to &s;ome imperfection in their natural powers. But as there is no &s;uch living &s;tandard, no one per&s;on to whom all mankind will allow &s;uch &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to be due, what is there of &s;ufficient authority to be the &s;tandard of the various and oppo&s;ite Ta&s;tes of men? Mo&s;t certainly there is no|thing but the Ta&s;te, as far as it can be ga|thered, of human nature. That which men concur the mo&s;t in admiring, mu&s;t be held to be beautiful. His Ta&s;te mu&s;t be e&s;teem|ed ju&s;t and true, which coincides with the general &s;entiments of men. In this &s;tandard we mu&s;t re&s;t. To the &s;en&s;e of mankind the ultimate appeal mu&s;t ever lie, in all works
<PB N="37" REF="43">
of Ta&s;te. If any one &s;hould maintain that &s;ugar was bitter and tobacco was &s;weet, no rea&s;onings could avail to prove it. The Ta&s;te of &s;uch a per&s;on would infallibly be held to be di&s;ea&s;ed, merely becau&s;e it differed &s;o widely from the Ta&s;te of the &s;pecies to which he belongs. In like manner, with re|gard to the objects of &s;entiment or internal Ta&s;te, the common feelings of men carry the &s;ame authority, and have a title to regulate the Ta&s;te of every individual.</P>
<P>BUT have we then, it will be &s;aid, no other criterion of what is beautiful, than the appro|bation of the majority? Mu&s;t we collect the voices of others, before we form any judg|ment for our&s;elves, of what de&s;erves applau&s;e in Eloquence or Poetry? By no means; there are principles of rea&s;on and &s;ound judgment which can be applied to matters of Ta&s;te, as well as to the &s;ubjects of &s;ci|ence and philo&s;ophy. He who admires or cen&s;ures any work of genius, is always rea|dy, if his Ta&s;te be in any degree improved, to a&s;&s;ign &s;ome rea&s;ons of his deci&s;ion. He appeals to principles, and points out the grounds on which he proceeds. Ta&s;te is a &s;ort of compound power, in which the light of the under&s;tanding always mingles, more or le&s;s, with the feelings of &s;entiment.</P>
<P>BUT, though rea&s;on can carry us a cer|tain length in judging concerning works of Ta&s;te, it is not to be forgotten that the ulti|mate
<PB N="38" REF="44">
conclu&s;ions to which our rea&s;onings lead, refer at la&s;t to &s;en&s;e and perception. We may &s;peculate and argue concerning pro|priety of conduct in a Tragedy, or an Epic Poem. Ju&s;t rea&s;onings on the &s;ubject will correct the caprice of unenlightened Ta&s;te, and e&s;tabli&s;h principles for judging of what de&s;erves prai&s;e. But, at the &s;ame time, the&s;e rea&s;onings appeal always, in the la&s;t re&s;ort, to feeling. The foundation upon which they re&s;t, is what has been found from experience to plea&s;e mankind mo&s;t univer&s;ally. Upon this ground we prefer a &s;imple and natural, to an artificial and affected &s;tyle; a regular and well-connected &s;tory, to loo&s;e and &s;cat|tered narratives; a cata&s;trophe which is ten|der and pathetic, to one which leaves us un|moved. It is from con&s;ulting our own ima|gination and heart, and from attending to the feelings of others, that any principles are formed which acquire authority in mat|ters of Ta&s;te<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The difference between the authors who found the &s;tan|dard of Ta&s;te upon the common feelings of human nature a&s;certained by general approbation, and tho&s;e who found it upon e&s;tabli&s;hed principles which can be a&s;certained by rea&s;on, is more an apparent than a real difference. Like many other literary controver&s;ies, it turns chiefly on modes of expre&s;&s;ion. For they who lay the greate&s;t &s;tre&s;s on &s;entiment and feeling, make no &s;cruple of applying argument and rea&s;on to matters of Ta&s;te. They appeal, like other writers, to e&s;tabli&s;hed principles, in judging of the excellencies of Eloquence or Poe|try; and plainly &s;hew, that the general approbation to which they ultimately recur, is an approbation re&s;ulting from di&s;cu&s;&s;ion as well as from &s;entiment. They, on the other hand, who, in order to vindicate Ta&s;te from any &s;u&s;picion of being arbitrary, maintain that it is a&s;certainable by the &s;tandard of rea&s;on, admit neverthele&s;s, that what plea&s;es univer&s;ally, mu&s;t on that account be held to be truly beautiful; and that no rules or conclu&s;ions concerning objects of Ta&s;te, can have any ju&s;t authority, if they be found to contradict the general &s;en|timents of men. The&s;e two &s;y&s;tems, therefore, differ in reality very little from one another. Sentiment and Rea&s;on enter into both; and by allowing to each of the&s;e powers its due place, both &s;y&s;tems may be rendered con&s;i&s;tent. Accord|ingly, it is in this light that I have endeavoured to place the &s;ubject.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="45">
WHEN we refer to the concurring &s;enti|ments of men as the ultimate te&s;t of what is to be accounted beautiful in the arts, this is to be always under&s;tood of men placed in &s;uch &s;ituations as are favourable to the pro|per exertions of Ta&s;te. Every one mu&s;t perceive, that among rude and uncivilized nations, and during the ages of ignorance and darkne&s;s, any loo&s;e notions that are en|tertained concerning &s;uch &s;ubjects carry no authority. In tho&s;e &s;tates of &s;ociety, Ta&s;te has no materials on which to operate. It is either totally &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, or appears in its lowe&s;t and mo&s;t imperfect form. We refer to the &s;entiments of mankind in poli&s;hed and flouri&s;hing nations; when arts are cul|tivated and manners refined; when works of genius are &s;ubjected to free di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and Ta&s;te is improved by Science and phi|lo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>EVEN among nations, at &s;uch a period of &s;ociety, I admit, that accidental cau&s;es may occa&s;ionally warp the proper operations of Ta&s;te; &s;ometimes the &s;tate of religion, &s;ome|times
<PB N="40" REF="46">
the form of government, may for a while pervert it; a licentious court may in|troduce a ta&s;te for fal&s;e ornaments, and di&s;|&s;olute writings. The u&s;age of one admired genius may procure approbation for his faults, and even render them fa&s;hionable. Some|times envy may have power to bear down, for a little, productions of great merit; while popular humour, or party &s;pirit, may, at other times, exalt to a high, though &s;hort-lived, re|putation, what little de&s;erved it. But though &s;uch ca&s;ual circum&s;tances give the appear|ance of caprice to the judgments of Ta&s;te, that appearance is ea&s;ily corrected. In the cour&s;e of time, the genuine ta&s;te of human nature never fails to di&s;clo&s;e it&s;elf, and to gain the a&s;cendant over any fanta&s;tic and corrupt|ed modes of Ta&s;te which may chance to have been introduced. The&s;e may have currency for a while, and mi&s;lead &s;uperficial judges; but being &s;ubjected to examination, by de|grees they pa&s;s away; while that alone re|mains which is founded on &s;ound rea&s;on, and tha native feelings of men.</P>
<P>I BY no means pretend, that there is any &s;tandard of Ta&s;te, to which, in every parti|cular in&s;tance, we can re&s;ort for clear and immediate determination. Where, indeed, is &s;uch a &s;tandard to be found for deciding any of tho&s;e great controver&s;ies in rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy, which perpetually divide mankind? In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, there was plainly no occa&s;ion for any &s;uch &s;trict and
<PB N="41" REF="47">
ab&s;olute provi&s;ion to be made. In order to judge of what is morally good or evil, of what man ought, or ought not in duty to do, it was fit that the means of clear and preci&s;e determination &s;hould be afforded us. But to a&s;certain in every ca&s;e with the utmo&s;t exact|ne&s;s what is beautiful or elegant, was not at all nece&s;&s;ary to the happine&s;s of man. And therefore &s;ome diver&s;ity in feeling was here allowed to take place; and room was left for di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and debate, concerning the degree of approbation to which any work of genius is entitled.</P>
<P>THE conclu&s;ion, which it is &s;ufficient for us to re&s;t upon, is, that Ta&s;te is far from be|ing an arbitrary principle, which is &s;ubject to the fancy of every individual, and which ad|mits of no criterion for determining whether it be fal&s;e or true. Its foundation is the &s;ame in all human minds. It is built upon &s;entiments and perceptions which belong to our nature; and which, in general, operate with the &s;ame uniformity as our other intel|lectual principles. When the&s;e &s;entiments are perverted by ignorance and prejudice, they are capable of being rectified by rea&s;on. Their &s;ound and natural &s;tate is ultimately determined, by comparing them with the general Ta&s;te of mankind. Let men declaim as much as they plea&s;e, concerning the ca|price and the uncertainty of Ta&s;te, it is found, by experience, that there are beauties, which, if they be di&s;played in a proper light, have
<PB N="42" REF="48">
power to command la&s;ting and general admi|ration. In every compo&s;ition, what intere&s;ts the imagination, and touches the heart, plea&s;es all ages and all nations. There is a certain &s;tring, which, being properly &s;truck, the hu|man heart is &s;o made as to an&s;wer to it.</P>
<P>HENCE the univer&s;al te&s;timony which the mo&s;t improved nations of the earth have con&s;pired, throughout a long tract of ages, to give to &s;ome few works of genius; &s;uch as the Iliad of Homer, and the Aeneid of Virgil. Hence the authority which &s;uch works have acquired, as &s;tandards in &s;ome degree of po|etical compo&s;ition; &s;ince from them we are enabled to collect what the &s;en&s;e of mankind is, concerning tho&s;e beauties which give them the highe&s;t plea&s;ure, and which therefore po|etry ought to exhibit. Authority or preju|dice may, in one age or country, give a tem|porary reputation to an indifferent poet, or a bad arti&s;t; but when foreigners, or when po&s;terity examine his works, his faults are di&s;cerned, and the genuine Ta&s;te of human nature appears. <Q REND="inline">"Opinionum commenta de|let dies; naturae judicia confirmat."</Q> Time overthrows the illu&s;ions of opinion, but e&s;ta|bli&s;hes the deci&s;ions of nature.</P>

<HEAD>LECTURE III. CRITICISM.&mdash;GENIUS.&mdash;PLEASURES OF TASTE.&mdash;SUBLIMITY IN OBJECTS.</HEAD>
<P>TASTE, Critici&s;m, and Genius, are words currently employed, without di&s;tinct ideas annexed to them. In begin|ning a cour&s;e of Lectures where &s;uch words mu&s;t often occur, it is nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;certain their meaning with &s;ome preci&s;ion. Having in the la&s;t Lecture treated of Ta&s;te, I pro|ceed to explain the nature and foundation of Critici&s;m. True Critici&s;m is the applica|tion of Ta&s;te and of good &s;en&s;e to the &s;eve|ral fine arts. The object which it propo&s;es is, to di&s;tingui&s;h what is beautiful and what is faulty in every performance; from parti|cular in&s;tances to a&s;cend to general princi|ples; and &s;o to form rules or conclu&s;ions concerning the &s;everal kinds of beauty in works of Genius.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="50">
THE rules of Critici&s;m are not formed by any induction, <HI>&agrave; priori,</HI> as it is called; that is, they are not formed by a train of ab&s;tract rea&s;oning, independent of facts and ob&s;erva|tions. Critici&s;m is an art founded wholly on experience; on the ob&s;ervation of &s;uch beau|ties as have come neare&s;t to the &s;tandard which I before e&s;tabli&s;hed: that is, of &s;uch beauties as have been found to plea&s;e man|kind mo&s;t generally. For example; Ari&s;|totle's rules concerning the unity of action in dramatic and epic compo&s;ition, were not rules fir&s;t di&s;covered by logical rea&s;oning, and then applied to poetry; but they were drawn from the practice of Homer and So|phocles: they were founded upon ob&s;erving the &s;uperior plea&s;ure which we receive from the relation of an action which is one and entire, beyond what we receive from the re|lation of &s;cattered and unconnected facts. Such ob&s;ervations taking their ri&s;e at fir&s;t from feeling and experience, were found on examination to be &s;o con&s;onant to rea&s;on, and to the principles of human nature, as to pa&s;s into e&s;tabli&s;hed rules, and to be conve|niently applied for judging of the excellency of any performance. This is the mo&s;t natu|ral account of the origin of Critici&s;m.</P>
<P>A MASTERLY genius, it is true, will of him&s;elf, untaught, compo&s;e in &s;uch a manner as &s;hall be agreeable to the mo&s;t material rules of Critici&s;m; for as the&s;e rules are founded in nature, nature will often &s;ugge&s;t
<PB N="45" REF="51">
them in practice. Homer, it is more than probable, was acquainted with no &s;y&s;tems of the art of poetry. Guided by genius alone, he compo&s;ed in ver&s;e a regular &s;tory, which all po&s;terity has admired. But this is no argument again&s;t the u&s;efulne&s;s of Criti|ci&s;m as an art. For as no human genius is perfect, there is no writer but may receive a&s;&s;i&s;tance from critical ob&s;ervations upon the beauties and faults of tho&s;e who have gone before him. No ob&s;ervations or rules can indeed &s;upply the defect of genius, or in|&s;pire it where it is wanting. But they may often direct it into its proper channell; they may correct its extravagancies, and point out to it the mo&s;t ju&s;t and proper imitation of nature. Critical rules are de&s;igned chiefly to &s;hew the faults that ought to be avoided. To nature we mu&s;t be indebted for the pro|duction of eminent beauties.</P>
<P>FROM what has been &s;aid, we are enabled to form a judgment concerning tho&s;e com|plaints which it has long been fa&s;hionable for petty authors to make again&s;t Critics and Critici&s;m. Critics have been repre&s;ented as the great abridgers of the native liberty of genius; as the impo&s;ers of unnatural &s;hackles and bonds upon writers, from who&s;e cruel per&s;ecution they mu&s;t fly to the Public, and implore its protection. Such &s;upplicatory prefaces are not calculated to give very fa|vourable ideas of the genius of the author. For every good writer will be plea&s;ed to have
<PB N="46" REF="52">
his work examined by the principles of &s;ound under&s;tanding, and true Ta&s;te. The decla|mations again&s;t Critici&s;m commonly proceed upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, that Critics are &s;uch as judge by rule, not by feeling; which is &s;o far from being true, that they who judge after this manner are pedants, not Critics. For all the rules of genuine Critici&s;m I have &s;hewn to be ultimately founded on feeling; and Ta&s;te and Feeling are nece&s;&s;ary to guide us in the application of the&s;e rules to every particular in&s;tance. As there is nothing in which all &s;orts of per&s;ons more readily affect to be judges than in works of Ta&s;te, there is no doubt that the number of incompetent Critics will always be great. But this affords no more foundation for a general invective again&s;t Critici&s;m, than the number of bad philo&s;ophers or rea&s;oners affords again&s;t rea|&s;on and philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>AN objection more plau&s;ible may be form|ed again&s;t Critici&s;m, from the applau&s;e that &s;ome performances have received from the Public, which, when accurately con&s;idered, are found to contradict the rules e&s;tabli&s;hed by Critici&s;m. Now, according to the princi|ples laid down in the la&s;t Lecture, the Public is the &s;upreme judge to whom the la&s;t appeal mu&s;t be made in every work of Ta&s;te; as the &s;tandard of Ta&s;te is founded on the &s;enti|ments that are natural and common to all men. But with re&s;pect to this we are to ob|&s;erve, that the &s;en&s;e of the Public is often
<PB N="47" REF="53">
too ha&s;tily judged of. The genuine public Ta&s;te does not always appear in the fir&s;t ap|plau&s;e given upon the publication of any new work. There are both a great vulgar and a &s;mall, apt to be catched and dazzled by very &s;uperficial beauties, the admiration of which in a little time pa&s;&s;es away: and &s;ometimes a writer may acquire great tem|porary reputation merely by his compliance with the pa&s;&s;ions or prejudices, with the party-&s;pirit or &s;uper&s;titious notions, that may chance to rule for a time almo&s;t a whole nation. In &s;uch ca&s;es, though the Public may &s;eem to prai&s;e, true Critici&s;m may with rea&s;on condemn; and it will in progre&s;s of time gain the a&s;cendant: for the judgment of true Critici&s;m, and the voice of the Pub|lic, when once become unprejudiced and di&s;|pa&s;&s;ionate, will ever coincide at la&s;t.</P>
<P>INSTANCES, I admit, there are, of &s;ome works that contain gro&s;s tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of the laws of Critici&s;m, acquiring, neverthele&s;s, a general, and even a la&s;ting admiration. Such are the plays of Shake&s;peare, which, con|&s;idered as dramatic poems, are irregular in the highe&s;t degree. But then we are to re|mark, that they have gained the public ad|miration, not by their being irregular, not by their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of the rules of art, but in &s;pite of &s;uch tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. They po&s;&s;e&s;s other beauties which are conformable to ju&s;t rules; and the force of the&s;e beau|ties has been &s;o great as to overpower all cen|&s;ure,
<PB N="48" REF="54">
and to give the Public a degree of &s;a|tisfaction &s;uperior to the di&s;gu&s;t ari&s;ing from their blemi&s;hes. Shake&s;peare plea&s;es, not by his bringing the tran&s;actions of many years into one play; not by his grote&s;que mixtures of Tragedy and Comedy in one piece, nor by the &s;trained thoughts, and affected witti|ci&s;ms, which he &s;ometimes employs. The&s;e we con&s;ider as blemi&s;hes, and impute them to the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of the age in which he lived. But he plea&s;es by his animated and ma&s;terly repre&s;entations of characters, by the liveli|ne&s;s of his de&s;criptions, the force of his &s;en|timents, and his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, beyond all wri|ters, the natural language of pa&s;&s;ion: Beau|ties which true Critici&s;m no le&s;s teaches us to place in the highe&s;t rank, than nature teaches us to feel.&mdash;This much it may &s;uffice to have &s;aid concerning the origin, office, and im|portance of Critici&s;m.</P>
<P>I PROCEED next to explain the meaning of another term, which there will be fre|quent occa&s;ion to employ in the&s;e Lectures; that is, <HI>Genius.</HI></P>
<P>TASTE and Genius are two words fre|quently joined together; and therefore, by innaccurate thinkers, confounded. They &s;ignify however two quite different things. The difference between them can be clearly pointed out; and it is of importance to re|member it. Ta&s;te con&s;i&s;ts in the power of judging: Genius, in the power of executing.
<PB N="49" REF="55">
One may have a con&s;iderable degree of Ta&s;te in Poetry, Eloquence, or any of the fine arts, who has little or hardly any Genius for com|po&s;ition or execution in any of the&s;e arts: But Genius cannot be found without includ|ing Ta&s;te al&s;o. Genius, therefore, de&s;erves to be con&s;idered as a higher power of the mind than Ta&s;te. Genius always imports &s;omething inventive or creative; which does not re&s;t in mere &s;en&s;ibility to beauty where it is perceived, but which can, moreover, produce new beauties, and exhibit them in &s;uch a manner as &s;trongly to impre&s;s the minds of others. Refined Ta&s;te forms a good critic; but Genius is farther nece&s;&s;ary to form the poet, or the orator.</P>
<P>IT is proper al&s;o to ob&s;erve, that Genius is a word, which, in common acceptation, extends much farther than to the objects of Ta&s;te. It is u&s;ed to &s;ignify that talent or ap|titude which we receive from nature, for ex|celling in any one thing whatever. Thus we &s;peak of a Genius for mathematics, as well as a Genius for poetry; of a Genius for war, for politics, or for any mechanical employment.</P>
<P>THIS talent or aptitude for excelling in &s;ome one particular, is, I have &s;aid, what we receive from nature. By art and &s;tudy, no doubt, it may be greatly improved; but by them alone it cannot be acquired. As Ge|nius is a higher faculty than Ta&s;te, it is ever,
<PB N="50" REF="56">
according to the u&s;ual frugality of nature, more limited in the &s;phere of its operations. It is not uncommon to meet with per&s;ons who have an excellent Ta&s;te in &s;everal of the po|lite arts, &s;uch as mu&s;ic, poetry, painting, and eloquence, altogether: But, to find one who is an excellent performer in all the&s;e arts, is much more rare; or rather, indeed, &s;uch an one is not to be looked for. A fort of Uni|ver&s;al Genius, or one who is equally and in|differently turned towards &s;everal different profe&s;&s;ions and arts, is not likely to excel in any. Although there may be &s;ome few ex|ceptions, yet in general it holds, that when the bent of the mind is wholly directed to|wards &s;ome one object, exclu&s;ive, in a man|ner, of others, there is the faire&s;t pro&s;pect of eminence in that, whatever it be. The rays mu&s;t converge to a point, in order to glow inten&s;ely. This remark I here chu&s;e to make, on account of its great importance to young people; in leading them to examine with care, and to pur&s;ue with ardour, the current and pointing of nature towards tho&s;e exer|tions of Genius in which they are mo&s;t likely to excel.</P>
<P>A GENIUS for any of the fine arts, as I before ob&s;erved, always &s;uppo&s;es Ta&s;te; and it is clear, that the improvement of Ta&s;te will &s;erve both to forward and to correct the ope|rations of Genius. In proportion as the Ta&s;te of a poet, or orator, becomes more refined with re&s;pect to the beauties of compo&s;ition,
<PB N="51" REF="57">
it will certainly a&s;&s;i&s;t him to produce the more fini&s;hed beauties in his work. Genius, how|ever, in a Poet or Orator, may &s;ometimes exi&s;t in a higher degree than Ta&s;te; that is, Genius may be bold and &s;trong, when Ta&s;te is neither very delicate, nor very correct. This is often the ca&s;e in the infancy of arts; a period, when Genius frequently exerts it&s;elf with great vigour, and executes with much warmth; while Ta&s;te, which requires expe|rience, and improves by &s;lower degrees, hath not yet attained its full growth. Homer and Shake&s;pear are proofs of what I now a&s;&s;ert; in who&s;e admirable writings are found in|&s;tances of rudene&s;s and indelicacy, which the more refined Ta&s;te of later writers, who had far inferior Genius to them, would have taught them to avoid. As all human perfec|tion is limited, this may very probably be the law of our nature, that it is not given to one man to execute with vigour and fire, and, at the &s;ame time, to attend to all the le&s;&s;er and more refined graces that belong to the exact perfection of his work: While, on the other hand, a thorough Ta&s;te for tho&s;e inferior graces, is, for the mo&s;t part, accompanied with a diminution of &s;ublimity and force.</P>
<P>HAVING thus explained the nature of Ta&s;te, the nature and importance of Criti|ci&s;m, and the di&s;tinction between Ta&s;te and Genius; I am now to enter on con&s;idering the &s;ources of the Plea&s;ures of Ta&s;te. Here opens a very exten&s;ive field; no le&s;s than all
<PB N="52" REF="58">
the plea&s;ures of the imagination, as they are commonly called, whether afforded us by na|tural objects, or by the imitations and de|&s;criptions of them. But it is not nece&s;&s;ary to the purpo&s;e of my Lectures, that all the&s;e &s;hould be examined fully; the plea&s;ure which we receive from di&s;cour&s;e, or writing, being the main object of them. All that I purpo&s;e is, to give &s;ome openings into the Plea&s;ures of Ta&s;te in general; and to in&s;i&s;t, more par|ticularly, upon Sublimity and Beauty.</P>
<P>WE are far from having yet attained to any &s;y&s;tem concerning this &s;ubject. Mr. Ad|di&s;on was the fir&s;t who attempted a regular enquiry, in his E&s;&s;ay on the Plea&s;ures of the Imagination, publi&s;hed in the &s;ixth volume of the Spectator. He has reduced the&s;e Plea|&s;ures under three heads; Beauty, Grandeur, and Novelty. His &s;peculations on this &s;ub|ject, if not exceedingly profound, are, how|ever, very beautiful and entertaining; and he has the merit of having opened a tract, which was before unbeaten. The advances made &s;ince his time in this curious part of philo&s;ophical Critici&s;m, are not very con&s;i|derable; though &s;ome ingenious writers have pur&s;ued the &s;ubject. This is owing, doubt|le&s;s, to that thinne&s;s and &s;ubtility which are found to be properties of all the feelings of Ta&s;te. They are engaging objects; but when we would lay firm hold of them, and &s;ubject them to a regular di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, they are always ready to elude our gra&s;p. It is difficult to
<PB N="53" REF="59">
make a full enumeration of the &s;everal ob|jects that give plea&s;ure to Ta&s;te; it is more difficult to define all tho&s;e which have been di&s;covered, and to reduce them under proper cla&s;&s;es; and, when we would go farther, and inve&s;tigate the efficient cau&s;es of the plea&s;ure which we receive from &s;uch objects, here, above all, we find our&s;elves at a lo&s;s. For in&s;tance; we all learn by experience, that certain figures of bodies appear to us more beautiful than others. On enquiring farther, we find that the regularity of &s;ome figures, and the graceful variety of others, are the foundation of the beauty which we di&s;cern in them; but when we attempt to go a &s;tep beyond this, and enquire what is the cau&s;e of regularity and variety producing in our minds the &s;en&s;ation of Beauty, any rea&s;on we can a&s;&s;ign is extremely imperfect. Tho&s;e fir&s;t principles of internal &s;en&s;ation, nature &s;eems to have covered with an impenetrable veil.</P>
<P>IT is &s;ome comfort, however, that although the efficient cau&s;e be ob&s;cure, the final cau&s;e of tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations lies in many ca&s;es more open: And, in entering on this &s;ubject, we cannot avoid taking notice of the &s;trong im|pre&s;&s;ion which the powers of Ta&s;te and Ima|gination are calculated to give us of the be|nignity of our Creator. By endowing us with &s;uch powers, he hath widely enlarged the &s;phere of the plea&s;ures of human life; and tho&s;e, too, of a kind the mo&s;t pure and
<PB N="54" REF="60">
innocent. The nece&s;&s;ary purpo&s;es of life might have been abundantly an&s;wered, though our &s;en&s;es of &s;eeing and hearing had only &s;erved to di&s;tingui&s;h external objects, without conveying to us any of tho&s;e refined and de|licate &s;en&s;ations of Beauty and Grandeur, with which we are now &s;o much delighted. This additional embelli&s;hment and glory, which, for promoting our entertainment, the Author of nature hath poured forth upon his works, is one &s;triking te&s;timony, among many others, of benevolence and goodne&s;s. This thought, which Mr. Addi&s;on fir&s;t &s;tart|ed, Dr. Aken&s;ide, in his Poem on the Plea|&s;ures of the Imagination, has happily pur|&s;ued.<Q><L>&mdash;Not content</L>

<L>Or Mu&s;ic to his ear.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>I SHALL begin with con&s;idering the Plea|&s;ure which ari&s;es from Sublimity or Gran|deur, of which I propo&s;e to treat at &s;ome length; both, as this has a character more preci&s;e and di&s;tinctly marked, than any other, of the Plea&s;ures of the Imagination, and as it coincides more directly with our main &s;ubject. For the greater di&s;tinctne&s;s I &s;hall, fir&s;t, treat of the Grandeur or Sublimity of external objects them&s;elves, which will em|ploy the re&s;t of this Lecture; and, after|wards,
<PB N="55" REF="61">
of the de&s;cription of &s;uch objects, or, of what is called the Sublime in Writing, which &s;hall be the &s;ubject of a following Lec|ture. I di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e two things from one another, the Grandeur of the objects them|&s;elves when they are pre&s;ented to the eye, and the de&s;cription of that Grandeur in di&s;|cour&s;e or writing; though mo&s;t Critics, inac|curately I think, blend them together; and I con&s;ider Grandeur and Sublimity as terms &s;ynonymous, or nearly &s;o. If there be any di&s;tinction between them, it ari&s;es from Su|blimity's expre&s;&s;ing Grandeur in its highe&s;t degree<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a Philo&s;ophical Inquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful. Dr. Gerard on Ta&s;te, Section II. Elements of Critici&s;m, Chap. IV.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is not ea&s;y to de&s;cribe, in words, the preci&s;e impre&s;&s;ion which great and &s;ublime objects make upon us, when we behold them; but every one has a conception of it. It con&s;i&s;ts in a kind of admiration and expan|&s;ion of the mind; it rai&s;es the mind much above its ordinary &s;tate; and fills it with a degree of wonder and a&s;toni&s;hment, which it cannot well expre&s;s. The emotion is cer|tainly delightful; but it is altogether of the &s;erious kind: a degree of awfulne&s;s and &s;o|lemnity, even approaching to &s;everity, com|monly attends it when at its height; very di&s;tingui&s;hable from the more gay and bri&s;k emotion rai&s;ed by beautiful objects.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="62">
THE &s;imple&s;t form of external Grandeur appears in the va&s;t and boundle&s;s pro&s;pects pre&s;ented to us by nature; &s;uch as wide ex|tended plains, to which the eye can &s;ee no limits; the firmament of Heaven; or the boundle&s;s expan&s;e of the Ocean. All va&s;t|ne&s;s produces the impre&s;&s;ion of Sublimity. It is to be remarked, however, that &s;pace, extended in length, makes not &s;o &s;trong an impre&s;&s;ion as height or depth. Though a boundle&s;s plain be a grand object, yet a high mountain, to which we look up, or an awful precipice or tower whence we look down on the objects which lie below, is &s;till more &s;o. The exce&s;&s;ive Grandeur of the firmament ari&s;es from its height, joined to its boundle&s;s extent; and that of the ocean, not from its extent alone, but from the perpetual motion and irre&s;i&s;tible force of that ma&s;s of waters. Wherever &s;pace is concerned, it is clear, that amplitude or greatne&s;s of extent, in one di|men&s;ion or other, is nece&s;&s;ary to Grandeur. Remove all bounds from any object, and you pre&s;ently render it &s;ublime. Hence infinite &s;pace, endle&s;s numbers, and eternal duration, fill the mind with great ideas.</P>
<P>FROM this &s;ome have imagined, that va&s;t|ne&s;s, or amplitude of extent, is the founda|tion of all Sublimity. But I cannot be of this opinion, becau&s;e many objects appear &s;ublime which have no relation to &s;pace at all. Such, for in&s;tance, is great loudne&s;s of &s;ound. The bur&s;t of thunder or of cannon,
<PB N="57" REF="63">
the roaring of winds, the &s;houting of multi|tudes, the &s;ound of va&s;t cataracts of water, are all inconte&s;tibly grand objects. <Q REND="inline">"I heard the voice of a great multitude, as the &s;ound of many waters, and of mighty thunderings, &s;aying Allelujah."</Q> In general we may ob|&s;erve, that great power and force exerted, always rai&s;e &s;ublime ideas: and perhaps the mo&s;t copious &s;ource of the&s;e is derived from this quarter. Hence the grandeur of earth|quakes and burning mountains; of great conflagrations; of the &s;tormy ocean, and overflowing waters; of tempe&s;ts of wind; of thunder and lightning; and of all the un|common violence of the elements. Nothing is more &s;ublime than mighty power and &s;trength. A &s;tream that runs within its banks, is a beautiful object; but when it ru&s;hes down with the impetuo&s;ity and noi&s;e of a torrent, it pre&s;ently becomes a &s;ublime one. From lions, and other animals of &s;trength, are drawn &s;ublime compari&s;ons in poets. A race hor&s;e is looked upon with plea&s;ure; but it is the war-hor&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"who&s;e neck is clothed with thunder,"</Q> that carries grandeur in its idea. The engagement of two great armies, as it is the highe&s;t exertion of human might, combines a variety of &s;ources of the Sublime; and has accordingly been always con&s;idered as one of the mo&s;t &s;triking and magnificent &s;pectacles that can be either pre&s;ented to the eye, or exhibited to the imagination in de&s;cription.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="64">
FOR the farther illu&s;tration of this &s;ubject, it is proper to remark, that all ideas of the &s;olemn and awful kind, and even bordering on the terrible, tend greatly to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Su|blime; &s;uch as darkne&s;s, &s;olitude, and &s;ilence. What are the &s;cenes of nature that elevate the mind in the highe&s;t degree, and produce the &s;ublime &s;en&s;ation? Not the gay land|&s;cape, the flowery field, or the flouri&s;hing city; but the hoary mountain, and the &s;olita|ry lake; the aged fore&s;t, and the torrent fall|ing over the rock. Hence too, night-&s;cenes are commonly the mo&s;t &s;ublime. The fir|mament when filled with &s;tars, &s;cattered in &s;uch va&s;t numbers, and with &s;uch magnifi|cent profu&s;ion, &s;trikes the imagination with a more awful grandeur, than when we view it enlightened by all the &s;plendour of the Sun. The deep &s;ound of a great bell, or the &s;trik|ing of a great clock, are at any time grand; but, when heard amid the &s;ilence and &s;tillne&s;s of the night, they become doubly &s;o. Dark|ne&s;s is very commonly applied for adding &s;u|blimity to all our ideas of the Deity. <Q REND="inline">"He maketh darkne&s;s his pavilion; he dwelleth in the thick cloud."</Q> So Milton<Q><L>&mdash;How oft, amid&s;t</L>

OBSCURITY, we are farther to remark, is not unfavourable to the Sublime. Though it render the object indi&s;tinct, the impre&s;&s;i|on, however, may be great; for, as an inge|nious Author has well ob&s;erved, it is one thing to make an idea clear, and another to make it affecting to the imagination; and the imagination may be &s;trongly affected; and, in fact, often is &s;o, by objects of which we have no clear conception. Thus we &s;ee, that almo&s;t all the de&s;criptions given us of the appearances of &s;upernatural Beings, car|ry &s;ome Sublimity, though the conceptions which they afford us be confu&s;ed and indi&s;|tinct.

ideas, it is plain, as are &s;o &s;ublime as tho&s;e taken from the Supreme Being; the mo&s;t un|known, but the greate&s;t of all objects; the infinity of who&s;e nature, and the eternity of who&s;e duration, joined with the omnipotence of his power, though they &s;urpa&s;s our con|ceptions, yet exalt them to the highe&s;t. In general, all objects that are greatly rai&s;ed above us, or far removed from us, either in &s;pace or in time, are apt to &s;trike us as great. Our viewing them, as through the mi&s;t of di&s;tance or antiquity, is favourable to the impre&s;&s;ions of their Sublimity.</P>
<P>AS ob&s;curity, &s;o di&s;order too, is very com|patible with grandeur; nay, frequently heightens it. Few things that are &s;trictly regular, and methodical, appear &s;ublime. We &s;ee the limits on every &s;ide; we feel our&s;elves confined; there is no room for the mind's exerting any great effort. Exact pro|portion of parts, though it enters often into the beautiful, is much di&s;regarded in the Sublime. A great ma&s;s of rocks, thrown together by the hand of nature with wild|ne&s;s and confu&s;ion, &s;trike the mind with

more grandeur, than if they had been ad|ju&s;ted to each other with the mo&s;t accurate &s;ymmetry.</P>
<P>IN the feeble attempts, which human art can make towards producing grand objects (feeble, I mean, in compari&s;on with the pow|ers of nature), greatne&s;s of dimen&s;ions al|ways con&s;titutes a principal part. No pile of building can convey any idea of Sublimity, unle&s;s it be ample and lofty. There is, too, in architecture, what is called Greatne&s;s of manner; which &s;eems chiefly to ari&s;e, from pre&s;enting the object to us in one full point of view; &s;o that it &s;hall make its impre&s;&s;ion whole, entire, and undivided, upon the mind. A Gothic cathedral rai&s;es ideas of grandeur in our minds, by its &s;ize, its height, its aw|ful ob&s;curity, its &s;trength, its antiquity, and its durability.</P>
<P>THERE &s;till remains to be mentioned one cla&s;s of Sublime objects; what may be called the moral, or &s;entimental Sublime; ari&s;ing from certain exertions of the human mind; from certain affections, and actions, of our fellow-creatures. The&s;e will be found to be all, or chiefly, of that cla&s;s, which comes under the name of Magnanimity or Hero|i&s;m; and they produce an effect extremely &s;imilar to what is produced by the view of grand objects in nature; filling the mind with admiration, and elevating it above it|&s;elf.

<P><PB N="65" REF="71">
I HAVE now enumerated a variety of in|&s;tances, both in inanimate objects and in hu|man life, wherein the Sublime appears. In all the&s;e in&s;tances, the emotion rai&s;ed in us is of the &s;ame kind, although the objects that produce the emotion be of widely different kinds. A que&s;tion next ari&s;es, whether we are able to di&s;cover &s;ome one fundamental quality in which all the&s;e different objects agree, and which is the cau&s;e of their pro|ducing an emotion of the &s;ame nature in our minds? Various hypothe&s;es have been formed concerning this; but, as far as appears to me, hitherto un&s;atisfactory. Some have imagined that amplitude, or great extent, joined with &s;implicity, is either immediately, or remotely, the fundamental quality of what|ever is &s;ublime; but we have &s;een that am|plitude is confined to one &s;pecies of Sublime Objects; and cannot, without violent &s;train|ing, be applied to them all. The Author of "a Philo&s;ophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful," to whom we are indebted for &s;everal inge|nious and original thoughts upon this &s;ubject, propo&s;es a formal theory upon this founda|tion, That terror is the &s;ource of the Su|blime, and that no objects have this charac|ter, but &s;uch as produce impre&s;&s;ions of pain
<PB N="66" REF="72">
and danger. It is indeed true, that many terrible objects are highly &s;ublime; and that grandeur does not refu&s;e an alliance with the idea of danger. But though this is very pro|perly illu&s;trated by the Author (many of who&s;e &s;entiments on that head I have adopt|ed), yet he &s;eems to &s;tretch his theory too far, when he repre&s;ents the Sublime as con|&s;i&s;ting wholly in modes of danger, or of pain. For the proper &s;en&s;ation of Sublimity, ap|pears to be very di&s;tingui&s;hable from the &s;en|&s;ation of either of tho&s;e; and, on &s;everal oc|ca&s;ions, to be entirely &s;eparated from them. In many grand objects, there is no coincid|ence with terror at all; as in the magnificent pro&s;pect of wide extended plains, and of the &s;tarry firmament; or in the moral di&s;po&s;iti|ons and &s;entiments, which we view with high admiration; and in many painful and terrible objects al&s;o, it is clear, there is no &s;ort of grandeur. The amputation of a limb, or the bite of a &s;nake, are exceedingly terrible; but are de&s;titute of all claim what|ever to Sublimity. I am inclined to think, that mighty force or power, whether accom|panied with terror or not, whether employed in protecting, or in alarming us, has a bet|ter title, than any thing that has yet been mentioned, to be the fundamental quality of the Sublime; as, after the review which we have taken, there does not occur to me any Sublime Object, into the idea of which, power, &s;trength, and force, either enter not directly, or are not, at lea&s;t, intimately a&s;&s;o|ciated
<PB N="67" REF="73">
with the idea, by leading our thoughts to &s;ome a&s;toni&s;hing power, as concerned in the production of the object. However, I do not in&s;i&s;t upon this as &s;ufficient to found a general theory: It is enough, now, to have given this view of the nature and different kinds of Sublime Objects; by which I hope to have laid a proper foundation for di&s;cu&s;|&s;ing, with greater accuracy, the Sublime in Writing and Compo&s;ition.</P>

<HEAD>LECTURE IV. THE SUBLIME IN WRITING.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING treated of Grandeur or Subli|mity in external objects, the way &s;eems now to be cleared, for treating, with more advantage, of the de&s;cription of &s;uch ob|jects; or, of what is called the Sublime in Writing. Though it may appear early to enter on the con&s;ideration of this &s;ubject; yet, as the Sublime is a &s;pecies of Writing which depends le&s;s than any other on the ar|tificial embelli&s;hments of rhetoric, it may be examined with as much propriety here, as in any &s;ub&s;equent part of the Lectures.</P>
<P>MANY critical terms have unfortunately been employed, in a &s;en&s;e too loo&s;e and vague; none more &s;o, than that of the Su|blime. Every one is acquainted with the character of Cae&s;ar's Commentaries, and of the &s;tyle in which they are written; a &s;tyle remarkably pure, &s;imple, and elegant; but
<PB N="69" REF="75">
the mo&s;t remote from the Sublime, of any of the cla&s;&s;ical authors. Yet this author has a German critic, Johannes Gulielmus Ber|gerus, who wrote no longer ago than the year 1720, pitched upon as the perfect model of the Sublime, and has compo&s;ed a quarto volume, entitled, <HI>De naturali pulchritudine Orationis;</HI> the expre&s;s intention of which, is to &s;hew, that Cae&s;ar's Commentaries con|tain the mo&s;t complete exemplification of all Longinus's rules relating to Sublime Writing. This I mention as a &s;trong proof of the con|fu&s;ed ideas which have prevailed, concern|ing this &s;ubject. The true &s;en&s;e of Sublime Writing, undoubtedly, is &s;uch a de&s;cription of objects, or exhibition of &s;entiments, which are in them&s;elves of a Sublime nature, as &s;hall give us &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions of them. But there is another very indefinite, and there|fore very improper, &s;en&s;e, which has been too often put upon it; when it is applied to fignify any remarkable and di&s;tingui&s;hing ex|cellency of compo&s;ition; whether it rai&s;e in us the ideas of grandeur, or tho&s;e of gentle|ne&s;s, elegance, or any other &s;ort of beauty. In this &s;en&s;e, Cae&s;ar's Commentaries may, in|deed, be termed Sublime, and &s;o may many Sonnets, Pa&s;torals, and Love Elegies, as well as Homer's Iliad. But this evidently con|founds the u&s;e of words; and marks no one &s;pecies, or character, of compo&s;ition what|ever.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="76">
I AM &s;orry to be obliged to ob&s;erve, that the Sublime is too often u&s;ed in this la&s;t and improper &s;en&s;e, by the celebrated critic Lon|ginus, in his treati&s;e on this &s;ubject. He &s;ets out, indeed, with de&s;cribing it in its ju&s;t and proper meaning; as &s;omething that elevates the mind above it&s;elf, and fills it with high conceptions, and a noble pride. But from this view of it he frequently departs; and &s;ub&s;titutes in the place of it, whatever, in any &s;train of compo&s;ition, plea&s;es highly. Thus, many of the pa&s;&s;ages which he pro|duces as in&s;tances of the Sublime, are mere|ly elegant, without having the mo&s;t di&s;tant relation to proper Sublimity; witne&s;s Sap|pho's famous Ode, on which he de&s;cants at con&s;iderable length. He points out five &s;ources of the Sublime. The fir&s;t is, Bold|ne&s;s or Grandeur in the Thoughts; the &s;e|cond is, the Pathetic; the third, the proper application of Figures; the fourth, the u&s;e of Tropes and beautiful Expre&s;&s;ions; the fifth, Mu&s;ical Structure and Arrangement of Words. This is the plan of one who was writing a treati&s;e of rhetoric, or of the beau|ties of Writing in general; not of the Su|blime in particular. For of the&s;e five heads, only the two fir&s;t have any peculiar relation to the Sublime; Boldne&s;s and Grandeur in the Thoughts, and, in &s;ome in&s;tances, the Pathetic, or &s;trong exertions of Pa&s;&s;ion: The other three, Tropes, Figures, and Mu&s;ical Arrangement, have no more relation to the Sublime, than to other kinds of good Writ|ing;
<PB N="71" REF="77">
perhaps le&s;s to the Sublime than to any other &s;pecies whatever; becau&s;e it requires le&s;s the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of ornament. From this it appears, that clear and preci&s;e ideas on this head are not to be expected from that writer. I would not, however, be under|&s;tood, as if I meant, by this cen&s;ure, to re|pre&s;ent his treati&s;e as of &s;mall value. I know no critic, antient or modern, that di&s;covers a more lively reli&s;h of the beauties of fine writing, than Longinus; and he has al&s;o the merit of being him&s;elf an excellent, and, in &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages, a truly Sublime, writer. But, as his work has been generally con&s;ider|ed as a &s;tandard on this &s;ubject, it was in|cumbent on me to give my opinion concern|ing the benefit to be derived from it. It de|&s;erves to be con&s;ulted, not &s;o much for di&s;|tinct in&s;truction concerning the Sublime, as for excellent general ideas concerning beauty in writing.</P>
<P>I RETURN now to the proper and natural idea of the Sublime in compo&s;ition. The foundation of it mu&s;t always be laid in the nature of the object de&s;cribed. Unle&s;s it be &s;uch an object as, if pre&s;ented to our eyes, if exhibited to us in reality, would rai&s;e ideas of that elevating, that awful, and magnifi|cent kind, which we call Sublime; the de|&s;cription, however finely drawn, is not en|titled to come under this cla&s;s. This ex|cludes all objects that are merely beautiful, gay, or elegant. In the next place, the ob|ject
<PB N="72" REF="78">
mu&s;t not only, in it&s;elf, be Sublime, but it mu&s;t be &s;et before us in &s;uch a light as is mo&s;t proper to give us a clear and full im|pre&s;&s;ion of it; it mu&s;t be de&s;cribed with &s;trength, with conci&s;ene&s;s, and &s;implicity. This depends, principally, upon the lively impre&s;&s;ion which the poet, or orator has of the object which he exhibits; and upon his being deeply affected, and warmed, by the Sublime idea which he would convey. If his own feeling be languid, he can never in|&s;pire us with any &s;trong emotion. In&s;tances, which are extremely nece&s;&s;ary on this &s;ub|ject, will clearly &s;how the importance of all tho&s;e requi&s;ites which I have ju&s;t now men|tioned.</P>
<P>IT is, generally &s;peaking, among the mo&s;t antient authors, that we are to look for the mo&s;t &s;triking in&s;tances of the Sublime, I am inclined to think, that the early ages of the world, and the rude unimproved &s;tate of &s;o|ciety, are peculiarly favourable to the &s;trong emotions of Sublimity. The genius of men is then much turned to admiration and a&s;to|ni&s;hment. Meeting with many objects, to them new and &s;trange, their imagination is kept glowing, and their pa&s;&s;ions are often rai&s;ed to the utmo&s;t. They think, and ex|pre&s;s them&s;elves boldly, and without re|&s;traint. In the progre&s;s of &s;ociety, the ge|nius and manners of men undergo a change more favourable to accuracy, than to &s;trength or Sublimity.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="79">
OF all writings, antient or modern, the Sacred Scriptures afford us the highe&s;t in|&s;tances of the Sublime. The de&s;criptions of the Deity, in them, are wonderfully noble; both from the grandeur of the object, and the manner of repre&s;enting it. What an a&s;|&s;emblage, for in&s;tance, of awful and &s;ublime ideas is pre&s;ented to us, in that pa&s;&s;age of the XVIIIth P&s;alm, where an appearance of the Almighty is de&s;cribed? <Q REND="inline">"In my di&s;tre&s;s I called upon the Lord; he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him. Then, the earth &s;hook and trem|bled; the foundations al&s;o of the hills were moved; becau&s;e he was wroth. He bow|ed the heavens, and came down, and dark|ne&s;s was under his feet; and he did ride upon a Cherub, and did fly; yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind. He made darkne&s;s his &s;ecret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters, and thick clouds of the &s;ky."</Q> Here, agreea|bly to the principles e&s;tabli&s;hed in the la&s;t Lecture, we &s;ee, with what propriety and &s;ucce&s;s the circum&s;tances of darkne&s;s and terror are applied for heightening the Su|blime. So, al&s;o, the prophet Habakkuk, in a &s;imilar pa&s;&s;age: <Q REND="inline">"He &s;tood, and mea&s;ured the earth; he beheld, and drove a&s;under the nations. The everla&s;ting mountains were &s;cattered; the perpetual hills did bow; his ways are everla&s;ting. The moun|tains &s;aw thee; and they trembled. The overflowing of the water pa&s;&s;ed by. The

deep uttered his voice, and lifted up his hands on high."</Q></P>
<P>THE noted in&s;tance, given by Longinus, from Mo&s;es, <Q REND="inline">"God &s;aid, let there be light; and there was light,"</Q> is not liable to the cen&s;ure which I pa&s;&s;ed on &s;ome of his in|&s;tances, of being foreign to the &s;ubject. It belongs to the true Sublime; and the Su|blimity of it ari&s;es from the &s;trong concep|tion it gives, of an exertion of power, pro|ducing its effect with the utmo&s;t &s;peed and facility. A thought of the &s;ame kind is magnificently amplified in the following pa&s;|&s;age of I&s;aiah (chap. xxiv. 24. 27. 28.): <Q REND="inline">"Thus &s;aith the Lord, thy Redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb: I am the Lord that maketh all things, that &s;tretcheth forth the heavens alone, that &s;preadeth abroad the earth by my&s;elf&mdash;that &s;aith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers; that &s;aith of Cyrus, He is my &s;hepherd, and &s;hall perform all my plea&s;ure; even, &s;aying to Jeru&s;alem, Thou &s;halt be built; and to the Temple, Thy foundation &s;hall be laid."</Q> There is a pa&s;&s;age in the P&s;alms, which de&s;erves to be mentioned un|der this head; <Q REND="inline">"God,"</Q> &s;ays the P&s;almi&s;t, <Q REND="inline">"&s;tilleth the noi&s;e of the &s;eas, the noi&s;e of their waves, and the tumults of the peo|ple."</Q> The joining together two &s;uch grand objects, as the ragings of the waters, and the tumults of the people, between which there is &s;o much re&s;emblance as to form a very na|tural

a&s;&s;ociation in the fancy, and the repre|&s;enting them both as &s;ubject, at one mo|ment, to the command of God, produces a noble effect.</P>
<P>HOMER is a poet, who, in all ages, and by all critics, has been greatly admired for Sublimity; and he owes much of his gran|deur to that native and unaffected &s;implicity which characteri&s;es his manner. His de&s;crip|tions of ho&s;ts engaging; the animation, the fire, and rapidity, which he throws into his battles, pre&s;ent to every reader of the Iliad, frequent in&s;tances of Sublime Writing. His introduction of the Gods, tends often to heighten, in a high degree, the maje&s;ty of his warlike &s;cenes. Hence Longinus be&s;tows &s;uch high and ju&s;t commendations on that pa&s;&s;age, in the XVth book of the Iliad, where Neptune, when preparing to i&s;&s;ue forth into the engagement, is de&s;cribed as &s;haking the mountains with his &s;teps, and driving his chariot along the ocean. Minerva, arming her&s;elf for fight in the Vth book; and Apol|lo, in the XVth, leading on the Trojans, and fla&s;hing terror with his Aegis on the face of the Greeks, are &s;imilar in&s;tances of great Sublimity added to the de&s;cription of battles, by the appearances of tho&s;e cele&s;tial beings. In the XXth book, where all the Gods take part in the engagement, according as they &s;everally favour either the Grecians, or the Trojans, the poet &s;eems to put forth one of his highe&s;t efforts, and the de&s;cription ri&s;es

into the mo&s;t awful magnificence. All na|ture is repre&s;ented as in commotion. Jupiter thunders in the heavens; Neptune &s;trikes the earth with his Trident; the &s;hips, the city, and the mountains &s;hake; the earth trembles to its centre; Pluto &s;tarts from his throne, in dread le&s;t the &s;ecrets of the infer|nal region &s;hould be laid open to the view of mortals.

THE works of O&s;&s;ian (as I have el&s;ewhere &s;hewn) abound with examples of the Su|blime. The &s;ubjects of that Author, and the manner in which he writes, are particu|larly favourable to it. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the plain and venerable manner of the antient times. He deals in no &s;uperfluous or gaudy ornaments; but throws forth his images with a rapid conci&s;ene&s;s, which enable them to &s;trike the mind with the greate&s;t force. Among poets of more poli&s;hed times, we are to look for the graces of correct writing, for ju&s;t proportion of parts, and &s;kilfully con|ducted narration. In the mid&s;t of &s;miling &s;cenery and plea&s;urable themes, the gay and the beautiful will appear, undoubtedly, to more advantage. But amid&s;t the rude &s;cenes of nature and of &s;ociety, &s;uch as O&s;&s;ian de|&s;cribes; amid&s;t rocks, and torrents, and whirlwinds, and battles, dwells the Sublime; and naturally a&s;&s;ociates it&s;elf with that grave

<P>I HAVE produced the&s;e in&s;tances, in order to demon&s;trate how e&s;&s;ential conci&s;ene&s;s and &s;implicity are to Sublime Writing.

The rea&s;on why a defect, either in conci&s;ene&s;s or &s;implicity, is hurtful in a peculiar manner to the Sublime, I &s;hall endeavour to explain.

Now, when an author has brought us, or is at|tempting to bring us, into this &s;tate; if he multiplies words unnece&s;&s;arily, if he decks the Sublime object which he pre&s;ents to us, round and round, with glittering ornaments; nay, if he throws in any one decoration that &s;inks in the lea&s;t below the capital image, that moment he alters the key; he relaxes the ten&s;ion of the mind; the &s;trength of the feeling is ema&s;culated; the Beautiful may remain, but the Sublime is gone.&mdash;When Ju|lius Cae&s;ar &s;aid to the Pilot who was afraid to put to &s;ea with him in a &s;torm, <Q REND="inline">"Quid times?

<P>ON account of the great importance of &s;implicity and conci&s;ene&s;s, I conceive rhyme, in Engli&s;h ver&s;e, to be, if not incon&s;i&s;tent with the Sublime, at lea&s;t very unfavourable to it. The con&s;trained elegance of this kind of ver&s;e, and &s;tudied &s;moothne&s;s of the &s;ounds, an&s;wering regularly to each other at the end of the line, though they be quite con&s;i&s;tent with gentle emotions, yet weaken the native force of Sublimity; be&s;ides, that the &s;uperfluous words which the poet is often obliged to introduce, in order to fill up the
<PB N="81" REF="87">
rhyme, tend farther to enfeeble it. Homer's de&s;cription of the nod of Jupiter, as &s;haking the heavens, has been admired, in all ages, as highly Sublime. Literally tran&s;lated, it runs thus: <Q REND="inline">"He &s;poke, and bending his &s;a|ble brows, gave the awful nod; while he &s;hook the cele&s;tial locks of his immortal head, all Olympus was &s;haken."</Q> Mr. Pope tran&s;lates it thus:<Q><L>He &s;poke; and awful bends his &s;able brows,</L>
<L>Shakes his ambro&s;ial curls, and gives the nod,</L>
<L>The &s;tamp of fate, and &s;anction of a God.</L>
<L>High Heaven with trembling the dread &s;ignal took,</L>
<L>And all Olympus to its centre &s;hook.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE image is &s;pread out, and attempted to be beautified; but it is, in truth, weak|ened. The third line&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"The &s;tamp of fate, and &s;anction of a God,"</Q> is merely exple|tive; and introduced for no other rea&s;on but to fill up the rhyme; for it interrupts the de|&s;cription, and clogs the image. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, out of mere compliance with the rhyme, Jupiter is repre&s;ented as &s;haking his locks before he gives the nod,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">Shakes his ambro&s;ial curls, and gives the nod,"</Q> which is trifling, and without meaning. Whereas, in the original, the hair of his head &s;haken, is the effect of his nod, and makes a happy picture&s;que circum&s;tance in the de&s;crip|tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Webb on the Beauties of Poetry.</NOTE>.</P>

THE boldne&s;s, freedom, and variety of our blank ver&s;e, is infinitely more favoura|ble than rhyme, to all kinds of Sublime poe|try. The fulle&s;t proof of this is afforded by Milton; an author, who&s;e genius led him eminently to the Sublime. The whole fir&s;t and &s;econd books of Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, are con|tinued in&s;tances of it. Take only, for an example, the following noted de&s;cription of Satan, after his fall, appearing at the head of the infernal ho&s;ts:<Q><L>&mdash;He, above the re&s;t,</L>
<L>In &s;hape and ge&s;ture proudly eminent,</L>
<L>Stood like a tower: his form had not yet lo&s;t</L>

<L>Of glory ob&s;cured: As when the &s;un, new ri&s;en,</L>
<L>Looks through the horizontal mi&s;ty air,</L>
<L>Shorn of his beams; or, from behind, the moon,</L>

<L>On half the nations, and with fear of change</L>
<L>Perplexes monarchs. Darken'd &s;o, yet &s;hone</L>

<PB N="83" REF="89">
whole expre&s;&s;ed in a &s;tyle and ver&s;ification, ea&s;y, natural, and &s;imple, but magnificent.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;poken of &s;implicity and conci&s;e|ne&s;s, as e&s;&s;ential to Sublime Writing. In my general de&s;cription of it, I mentioned Strength, as another nece&s;&s;ary requi&s;ite. The Strength of de&s;cription ari&s;es, in a great mea&s;ure, from a &s;imple conci&s;ene&s;s; but, it &s;uppo&s;es al&s;o &s;omething more; namely, a proper choice of circum&s;tances in the de&s;cription, &s;o as to ex|hibit the object in its full and mo&s;t &s;triking point of view. For every object has &s;everal faces, &s;o to &s;peak, by which it may be pre&s;ented to us, according to the circum|&s;tances with which we &s;urround it; and it will appear eminently Sublime, or not, in proportion as all the&s;e circum&s;tances are hap|pily cho&s;en, and of a Sublime kind. Here lies the great art of the writer; and indeed, the great difficulty of Sublime de&s;cription. If the de&s;cription be too general, and dive&s;t|ed of circum&s;tances, the object appears in a faint light; it makes a feeble impre&s;&s;ion, or no impre&s;&s;ion at all, on the reader. At the &s;ame time, if any trivial or improper circum|&s;tances are mingled, the whole is degraded.</P>
<P>A STORM or tempe&s;t, for in&s;tance, is a Su|blime object in nature. But, to render it Sublime in de&s;cription, it is not enough, ei|ther to give us mere general expre&s;&s;ions con|cerning the violence of the tempe&s;t, or to de&s;cribe its common, vulgar effects, in over|throwing

trees and hou&s;es. It mu&s;t be paint|ed with &s;uch circum&s;tances as fill the mind with great and awful ideas. This is very happily done by Virgil, in the following pa&s;&s;age:<Q><L>Ip&s;e Pater, media nimborum in nocte, coru&s;c&acirc;</L>

<P>EVERY circum&s;tance in this noble de&s;crip|tion is the production of an imagination heated and a&s;toni&s;hed with the grandeur of the object. If there be any defect, it is in the words immediately following tho&s;e I have quoted; <Q REND="inline">"Ingeminant Au&s;tri, et den|&s;i&s;&s;imus imber;"</Q> where the tran&s;ition is made too ha&s;tily, I am afraid, from the pre|ceding Sublime images, to a thick &s;hower, and the blowing of the &s;outh wind; and
<PB N="85" REF="91">
&s;hews how difficult it frequently is, to de&s;cend with grace, without &s;eeming to fall.</P>
<P>THE high importance of the rule which I have been now giving, concerning the pro|per choice of circum&s;tances, when de&s;crip|tion is meant to be Sublime, &s;eems to me not to have been &s;ufficiently attended to. It has, however, &s;uch a foundation in nature, as ren|ders the lea&s;t deflexion from it fatal. When a writer is aiming at the beautiful only, his de&s;criptions may have improprieties in them, and yet be beautiful &s;till. Some trivial, or misjudged circum&s;tances, can be overlooked by the reader; they make only the difference of more or le&s;s; the gay, or plea&s;ing emo|tion, which he has rai&s;ed, &s;ub&s;i&s;ts &s;till. But the ca&s;e is quite different with the Sublime. There, one trifling circum&s;tance, one mean idea, is &s;ufficient to de&s;troy the whole charm. This is owing to the nature of the emotion aimed at by Sublime de&s;cription, which ad|mits of no mediocrity, and cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t in a middle &s;tate; but mu&s;t either highly tran|&s;port us, or, if un&s;ucce&s;sful in the execution, leave us greatly di&s;gu&s;ted, and di&s;plea&s;ed. We attempt to ri&s;e along with the writer; the imagination is awakened, and put upon the &s;tretch; but it requires to be &s;upported; and if, in the mid&s;t of its effort, you de&s;ert it unexpectedly, down it comes with a pain|ful &s;hock. When Milton, in his battle of the angels, de&s;cribes them as tearing up the mountains, and throwing them at one ano|ther;
<PB N="86" REF="92">
there are, in his de&s;cription, as Mr. Ad|di&s;on has ob&s;erved, no circum&s;tances but what are properly Sublime:<Q><L>From their foundations loos'ning to and fro,</L>
<L>They plucked the &s;eated hills, with all their load,</L>
<L>Rocks, waters, woods; and by the &s;haggy tops</L>
<L>Uplifting, bore them in their hands.&mdash;</L></Q> Whereas Claudian, in a fragment upon the war of the giants, has contrived to render this idea of their throwing the mountains, which is in it&s;elf &s;o grand, burle&s;que and ri|diculous; by this &s;ingle circum&s;tance, of one of his giants with the mountain Ida upon his &s;houlders, and a river, which flowed from the mountain, running down along the gi|ant's back, as he held it up in that po&s;ture. There is a de&s;cription too in Virgil, which, I think, is cen&s;urable, though more &s;lightly, in this re&s;pect. It is that of the burning moun|tain Aetna; a &s;ubject certainly very proper to be worked up by a poet into a Sublime de&s;cription:<Q><L>&mdash;Horrificis juxta tonat Aetna ruinis.</L>

Here, after &s;everal magnificent images, the Poet concludes with per&s;onifying the moun|tain under this figure, <Q REND="inline">"eructans vi&s;cera cum gemitu,"</Q> belching up its bowels with a groan; which, by likening the mountain to a &s;ick, or drunk per&s;on, degrades the ma|je&s;ty of the de&s;cription. It is to no purpo&s;e to tell us, that the Poet here alludes to the fable of the giant Enceladus lying under mount Aetna; and that he &s;uppo&s;es his mo|tions and to&s;&s;ings to have occa&s;ioned the fiery eruptions. He intended the de&s;cription of a Sublime object; and the natural ideas, rai&s;ed by a burning mountain, are infinitely more lofty, than the belchings of any giant, how huge &s;oever. The deba&s;ing effect of the idea which is here pre&s;ented, will appear in a &s;tronger light, by &s;eeing what figure it makes in a poem of Sir Richard Blackmore's, who, through a mon&s;trous perver&s;ity of ta&s;te, had cho&s;en this for the capital circum&s;tance in his de&s;cription, and thereby (as Dr. Arbuthnot humourou&s;ly ob&s;erves, in his Treati&s;e on the Art of Sinking) had repre&s;ented the moun|tain as in a fit of the cholic.<Q><PB N="88" REF="94">
<L>Aetna, and all the burning mountains find</L>
<L>Their kindled &s;tores with inbred &s;torms of wind</L>
<L>Blown up to rage, and roaring out complain,</L>
<L>As torn with inward gripes and torturing pain;</L>
<L>Labouring, they ca&s;t their dreadful vomit round,</L>
<L>And with their melted bowels &s;pread the ground.</L></Q> Such in&s;tances &s;hew how much the Sublime depends upon a ju&s;t &s;election of circum|&s;tances; and with how great care every cir|cum&s;tance mu&s;t be avoided, which, by bor|dering in the lea&s;t upon the mean, or even upon the gay or the trifling, alters the tone of the emotion.</P>
<P>IF it &s;hall now be enquired, What are the proper &s;ources of the Sublime? My an&s;wer is, That they are to be looked for every where in nature. It is not by hunting after tropes, and figures, and rhetorical a&s;&s;i&s;tances, that we can expect to produce it. No: it &s;tands clear, for the mo&s;t part, of the&s;e la|boured refinements of art. It mu&s;t come un&s;ought, if it come at all; and be the na|tural offspring of a &s;trong imagination.
<Q><L>E&s;t Deus in nobis; agitante cale&s;cimus illo.</L></Q>
Wherever a great and awful object is pre|&s;ented in nature, or a very magnanimous and exalted affection of the human mind is di&s;played; thence, if you can catch the im|pre&s;&s;ion &s;trongly, and exhibit it warm and glowing, you may draw the Sublime. The&s;e are its only proper &s;ources. In judging of
<PB N="89" REF="95">
any &s;triking beauty in compo&s;ition, whether it is, or is not, to be referred to this cla&s;s, we mu&s;t attend to the nature of the emotion which it rai&s;es; and only, if it be of that elevating, &s;olemn, and awful kind, which di&s;tingui&s;hes this feeling, we can pronounce it Sublime.</P>
<P>FROM the account which I have given of the nature of the Sublime, it clearly follows, that it is an emotion which can never be long protracted. The mind, by no force of genius, can be kept, for any con&s;iderable time, &s;o far rai&s;ed above its common tone; but will, of cour&s;e, relax into its ordinary &s;ituation. Neither are the abilities of any human writer &s;ufficient to &s;upply a continued run of unmixed Sublime conceptions. The utmo&s;t we can expect is, that this fire of imagination &s;hould &s;ometimes fla&s;h upon us like lightning from heaven, and then di&s;ap|pear. In Homer and Milton, this effulgence of genius breaks forth more frequently, and with greater lu&s;tre than in mo&s;t authors. Shake&s;peare al&s;o ri&s;es often into the true Sublime. But no author whatever is Sublime throughout. Some, indeed, there are, who, by a &s;trength and dignity in their concepti|ons, and a current of high ideas that runs through their whole compo&s;ition, pre&s;erve the reader's mind always in a tone nearly allied to the Sublime; for which rea&s;on they may, in a limited &s;en&s;e, merit the name of continued Sublime writers; and, in this
<PB N="90" REF="96">
cla&s;s, we may ju&s;tly place Demo&s;thenes and Plato.</P>
<P>As for what is called the Sublime &s;tyle, it is, for the mo&s;t part, a very bad one; and has no relation whatever to the real Sublime. Per&s;ons are apt to imagine, that magnificent words, accumulated epithets, and a certain &s;welling kind of expre&s;&s;ion, by ri&s;ing above what is u&s;ual or vulgar, contributes to, or even forms, the Sublime. Nothing can be more fal&s;e. In all the in&s;tances of Sublime Writing, which I have given, nothing of this kind appears. <Q REND="inline">"God &s;aid, Let there be light, and there was light."</Q> This is &s;triking and Sublime. But put it into what is commonly called the Sublime &s;tyle: <Q REND="inline">"The Sovereign Arbiter of nature, by the potent energy of a &s;ingle word, commanded the light to ex|i&s;t:"</Q> and, as Boileau has well ob&s;erved, the &s;tyle indeed is rai&s;ed, but the thought is fall|en. In general, in all good writing, the Su|blime lies in the thought, not in the words; and when the thought is truly noble, it will, for the mo&s;t part, clothe it&s;elf in a native dig|nity of language. The Sublime, indeed, re|jects mean, low, or trivial expre&s;&s;ions; but it is equally an enemy to &s;uch as are turgid. The main &s;ecret of being Sublime, is to &s;ay great things in few and plain words. It will be found to hold, without exception, that the mo&s;t Sublime authors are the &s;imple&s;t in their &s;tyle; and wherever you find a writer, who affects a more than ordinary pomp and parade

<P>THE &s;ame unfavourable judgment we mu&s;t pa&s;s, on all that laboured apparatus with which &s;ome writers introduce a pa&s;&s;age, or de&s;cription, which they intend &s;hall be Su|blime; calling on their readers to attend, in|voking their Mu&s;e, or breaking forth into general, unmeaning exclamations, concern|ing the greatne&s;s, terriblene&s;s, or maje&s;ty of the object, which they are to de&s;cribe. Mr. Addi&s;on, in his Campaign, has fallen into an error of this kind, when about to de&s;cribe the battle of Blenheim.<Q><L>But O! my Mu&s;e! what numbers wilt thou find</L>
<L>To &s;ing the furious troops in battle joined?</L>
<L>Methinks, I hear the drum's tumultuous &s;ound,</L>
<L>The victor's &s;houts, and dying groans, confound; &amp;c.</L></Q> Introductions of this kind, are a forced at|tempt in a writer, to &s;pur up him&s;elf, and his reader, when he finds his imagination flagging in vigour. It is like taking artificial &s;pirits in order to &s;upply the want of &s;uch as are natural. By this ob&s;ervation, however, I do not mean to pa&s;s a general cen&s;ure on Mr. Addi&s;on's Campaign, which, in &s;everal places, is far from wanting merit; and in particular, the noted compari&s;on of his hero

to the angel who rides in the whirlwind and directs the &s;torm, is a truly Sublime image.</P>
<P>THE faults oppo&s;ite to the Sublime are chiefly two; the Frigid, and the Bomba&s;t. The Frigid con&s;i&s;ts, in degrading an object, or &s;entiment, which is Sublime in it&s;elf, by our mean conception of it; or by our weak, low, and childi&s;h de&s;cription of it. This betrays entire ab&s;ence, or at lea&s;t great po|verty of genius. Of this, there are abun|dance of examples, and the&s;e commented upon with much humour, in the Treati&s;e on the Art of Sinking, in Dean Swift's works; the in&s;tances taken chiefly from Sir Richard Blackmore. One of the&s;e, I had occa&s;ion already to give, in relation to mount Aetna, and it were needle&s;s to produce any more. The Bomba&s;t lies, in forcing an ordinary or trivial object out of its rank, and endeavour|ing to rai&s;e it into the Sublime; or, in at|tempting to exalt a Sublime object beyond all natural and rea&s;onable bounds. Into this error, which is but too common, writers of genius may &s;ometimes fall, by unluckily lo&s;|ing &s;ight of the true point of the Sublime. This is al&s;o called Fu&s;tian, or Rant. Shake&s;|peare, a great, but incorrect genius, is not unexceptionable here. Dryden and Lee, in their tragedies, abound with it.</P>
<P>THUS far of the Sublime; of which I have treated fully, becau&s;e it is &s;o capital an excel|lency in fine writing, and becau&s;e clear and
<PB N="93" REF="99">
preci&s;e ideas on this head are, as far as I know, not to be met with in critical writers.</P>
<P>BEFORE concluding this Lecture, there is one ob&s;ervation which I chu&s;e to make at this time; I &s;hall make it once for all, and hope it will be afterwards remembered. It is with re&s;pect to the in&s;tances of faults, or ra|ther blemi&s;hes and imperfections, which, as I have done in this Lecture, I &s;hall hereafter continue to take, when I can, from writers of reputation. I have not the lea&s;t inten|tion thereby to di&s;parage their character in the general. I &s;hall have other occa&s;ions of doing equal ju&s;tice to their beauties. But it is no reflection on any human performance, that it is not ab&s;olutely perfect. The ta&s;k would be much ea&s;ier for me, to collect in|&s;tances of faults from bad writers. But they would draw no attention, when quoted from books which nobody reads. And I conceive, that the method which I follow, will contri|bute more to make the be&s;t authors be read with plea&s;ure, when one properly di&s;tin|gui&s;hes their beauties from their faults; and is led to imitate and admire only what is worthy of imitation and admiration.</P>

<HEAD>LECTURE V. BEAUTY, AND OTHER PLEASURES OF TASTE.</HEAD>
<P>AS Sublimity con&s;titutes a particular cha|racter of compo&s;ition, and forms one of the highe&s;t excellencies of eloquence and of poetry, it was proper to treat of it at &s;ome length. It will not be nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;cu&s;s &s;o particularly all the other plea&s;ures that ari&s;e from Ta&s;te, as &s;ome of them have le&s;s relation to our main &s;ubject. On Beauty only I &s;hall make &s;everal ob&s;ervations, both as the &s;ubject is curious, and as it tends to improve Ta&s;te, and to di&s;cover the founda|tion of &s;everal of the graces of de&s;cription and of poetry<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Hutchin&s;on's Enquiry concerning Beauty and Virtue.&mdash;Gerard on Ta&s;te, chap. iii.&mdash;Enquiry into the Origin of the Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful.&mdash;Elements of Critici&s;m, chap. iii.&mdash;Spectator, vol. vi. E&s;&s;ay on the Plea&s;ures of Ta&s;te.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="101">
BEAUTY, next to Sublimity, affords, be|yond doubt, the highe&s;t plea&s;ure to the ima|gination. The emotion which it rai&s;es, is very di&s;tingui&s;hable from that of Sublimity. It is of a calmer kind; more gentle and &s;ooth|ing; does not elevate the mind &s;o much, but produces an agreeable &s;erenity. Sublimity rai&s;es a feeling, too violent, as I &s;howed, to be la&s;ting; the plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from Beauty admits of longer continuance. It extends al&s;o to a much greater variety of objects than Sublimity; to a variety indeed &s;o great, that the feelings which Beautiful objects pro|duce, differ con&s;iderably, not in degree only, but al&s;o in kind, from one another. Hence, no word in the language is u&s;ed in a more vague &s;ignification than Beauty. It is ap|plied to almo&s;t every external object that plea&s;es the eye, or the ear; to a great num|ber of the graces of writing; to many di&s;|po&s;itions of the mind; nay, to &s;everal ob|jects of mere ab&s;tract &s;cience. We talk cur|rently of a beautiful tree or flower; a beau|tiful poem; a beautiful character; and a beautiful theorem in mathematics.</P>
<P>HENCE we may ea&s;ily perceive, that, among &s;o great a variety of objects, to find out &s;ome one quality in which they all agree, and which is the foundation of that agreea|ble &s;en&s;ation they all rai&s;e, mu&s;t be a very difficult, if not, more probably, a vain at|tempt. Objects, denominated Beautiful, are &s;o different, as to plea&s;e, not in virtue of any
<PB N="96" REF="102">
one quality common to them all, but by means of &s;everal different principles in hu|man nature. The agreeable emotion which they all rai&s;e, is &s;omewhat of the &s;ame na|ture; and therefore, has the common name of Beauty given to it; but it is rai&s;ed by dif|ferent cau&s;es.</P>
<P>HYPOTHESES, however, have been framed by ingenious men, for a&s;&s;igning the funda|mental quality of Beauty in all objects. In particular, Uniformity amid&s;t Variety, has been in&s;i&s;ted on as this fundamental quality. For the Beauty of many figures, I admit that this accounts in a &s;atisfying manner. But when we endeavour to apply this prin|ciple to Beautiful objects of &s;ome other kind, as to Colour for in&s;tance, or Motion, we &s;hall &s;oon find that it has no place. And even in external figured objects, it does not hold, that their Beauty is in proportion to their mixture of Variety with Uniformity; &s;eeing many plea&s;e us as highly beautiful, which have al|mo&s;t no variety at all; and others, which are various to a degree of intricacy. Laying &s;y&s;tems of this kind, therefore, a&s;ide, what I now propo&s;e is, to give an enumeration of &s;everal of tho&s;e cla&s;&s;es of objects in which Beauty mo&s;t remarkably appears; and to point out, as far as I can, the &s;eparate prin|ciples of Beauty in each of them.</P>
<P>COLOUR affords, perhaps, the &s;imple&s;t in|&s;tance of Beauty, and therefore the fitte&s;t to
<PB N="97" REF="103">
begin with. Here, neither Variety, nor U|niformity, nor any other principle that I know, can be a&s;&s;igned, as the foundation of Beauty. We can refer it to no other cau&s;e but the &s;tructure of the eye, which deter|mines us to receive certain modifications of the rays of light with more plea&s;ure than others. And we &s;ee accordingly, that, as the organ of &s;en&s;ation varies in different per|&s;ons, they have their different favourite co|lours. It is probable, that a&s;&s;ociation of ideas has influence, in &s;ome ca&s;es, on the plea&s;ure which we receive from colours. Green, for in&s;tance, may appear more beau|tiful, by being connected in our ideas with rural pro&s;pects and &s;cenes; white, with in|nocence; blue, with the &s;erenity of the &s;ky. Independent of a&s;&s;ociations of this kind, all that we can farther ob&s;erve concerning co|lours is, that tho&s;e cho&s;en for Beauty are, generally, delicate, rather than glaring. Such are tho&s;e paintings with which nature hath ornamented &s;ome of her works, and which art &s;trives in vain to imitate; as the feathers of &s;everal kinds of birds, the leaves of flow|ers, and the fine variation of colours exhi|bited by the &s;ky at the ri&s;ing and &s;etting of the &s;un. The&s;e pre&s;ent to us the highe&s;t in|&s;tances of the Beauty of colouring; and have accordingly been the favourite &s;ubjects of poetical de&s;cription in all countries.</P>
<P>FROM Colour we proceed to Figure, which opens to us forms of Beauty more complex
<PB N="98" REF="104">
and diver&s;ified. Regularity fir&s;t occurs to be noticed as a &s;ource of Beauty. By a regular figure, is meant, one which we perceive to be formed according to &s;ome certain rule, and not left arbitrary, or loo&s;e, in the con&s;truc|tion of its parts. Thus, a circle, a &s;quare, a triangle, or a hexagon, plea&s;e the eye, by their regularity, as beautiful figures. We mu&s;t not, however, conclude, that all figures plea&s;e in proportion to their regularity; or that regularity is the &s;ole, or the chief, foun|dation of Beauty in figure. On the contra|ry, a certain graceful variety is found to be a much more powerful principle of Beauty; and is therefore &s;tudied a great deal more than regularity, in all works that are de&s;igned merely to plea&s;e the eye. I am, indeed, in|clined to think, that regularity appears beau|tiful to us, chiefly, if not only, on account of its &s;ugge&s;ting the ideas of fitne&s;s, propri|ety, and u&s;e, which have always a greater connection with orderly and proportioned forms, than with tho&s;e which appear not con&s;tructed according to any certain rule. It is clear, that nature, who is undoubtedly the mo&s;t graceful arti&s;t, hath, in all her orna|mental works, pur&s;ued variety, with an ap|parent neglect of regularity. Cabinets, doors, and windows, are made after a regular form, in cubes and parallelograms, with exact pro|portion of parts; and by being &s;o formed they plea&s;e the eye; for this good rea&s;on, that, being works of u&s;e, they are, by &s;uch figures, the better &s;uited to the ends for which they
<PB N="99" REF="105">
were de&s;igned. But plants, flowers, and leaves are full of variety and diver&s;ity. A &s;traight canal is an in&s;ipid figure, in compa|ri&s;on of the maeanders of rivers. Cones and pyramids are beautiful; but trees growing in their natural wildne&s;s, are infinitely more beautiful than when trimmed into pyramids and cones. The apartments of a hou&s;e mu&s;t be regular in their di&s;po&s;ition, for the conve|niency of its inhabitants; but a garden, which is de&s;igned merely for Beauty, would be ex|ceedingly di&s;gu&s;ting, if it had as much uni|formity and order in its parts as a dwelling|hou&s;e.</P>
<P>MR. HOGARTH, in his Analy&s;is of Beauty, has ob&s;erved, that figures bounded by curve lines are, in general, more beautiful than tho&s;e bounded by &s;traight lines and angles. He pitches upon two lines, on which, according to him, the Beauty of figure principally de|pends; and he has illu&s;trated, and &s;upported his doctrine, by a &s;urpri&s;ing number of in|&s;tances. The one is the Waving Line, or a curve bending backwards and forwards, &s;ome|what in the form of the letter S. This he calls the Line of Beauty; and &s;hews how often it is found in &s;hells, flowers, and &s;uch other ornamental works of nature; as is common al&s;o in the figures de&s;igned by paint|ers and &s;culptors, for the purpo&s;e of decora|tion. The other Line, which he calls the Line of Grace, is the former waving curve, twi&s;ted round &s;ome &s;olid body. The curling
<PB N="100" REF="106">
worm of a common jack is one of the in|&s;tances he gives of it. Twi&s;ted pillars, and twi&s;ted horns, al&s;o exhibit it. In all the in|&s;tances which he mentions, Variety plainly appears to be &s;o material a principle of Beau|ty, that he &s;eems not to err much when he defines the art of drawing plea&s;ing forms, to be the art of varying well. For the curve line, &s;o much the favourite of painters, de|rives, according to him, its chief advantage, from its perpetual bending and variation from the &s;tiff regularity of the &s;traight line.</P>
<P>MOTION furni&s;hes another &s;ource of Beau|ty, di&s;tinct from Figure. Motion of it&s;elf is plea&s;ing; and bodies in motion are, <Q REND="inline">"caete|ris paribus,"</Q> preferred to tho&s;e in re&s;t. It is, however, only gentle motion that belongs to the Beautiful; for when it is very &s;wift, or very forcible, &s;uch as that of a torrent, it partakes of the Sublime. The motion of a bird gliding through the air, is extremely Beautiful; the &s;wiftne&s;s with which light|ning darts through the heavens, is magnifi|cent and a&s;toni&s;hing. And here, it is proper to ob&s;erve, that the &s;en&s;ations of Sublime and Beautiful are not always di&s;tingui&s;hed by very di&s;tant boundaries; but are capable, in &s;everal in&s;tances, of approaching towards each other. Thus, a &s;mooth running &s;tream, is one of the mo&s;t beautiful objects in na|ture: as it &s;wells gradually into a great river, the beautiful, by degrees, is lo&s;t in the Su|blime. A young tree is a beautiful object;
<PB N="101" REF="107">
a &s;preading antient oak, is a venerable and a grand one. The calmne&s;s of a fine morn|ing is beautiful; the univer&s;al &s;tillne&s;s of the evening is highly Sublime. But to return to the Beauty of motion, it will be found, I think, to hold very generally, that motion in a &s;traight line is not &s;o beautiful as in an un|dulating waving direction; and motion up|wards is, commonly too, more agreeable than motion downwards. The ea&s;y curling mo|tion of flame and &s;moke to be in&s;tanced, as an object &s;ingularly agreeable: and here Mr. Hogarth's waving line recurs upon us as a principle of Beauty. That arti&s;t ob&s;erves very ingeniou&s;ly, that all the common and nece&s;&s;ary motions for the bu&s;ine&s;s of life, are performed by men in &s;traight or plain lines; but that all the graceful and ornamental movements are made in waving lines: an ob&s;ervation not unworthy of being attended to, by all who &s;tudy the grace of ge&s;ture and action.</P>
<P>THOUGH Colour, Figure, and Motion, be &s;eparate principles of Beauty; yet in many beautiful objects they all meet, and thereby render the Beauty both greater, and more complex. Thus, in flowers, trees, animals, we are entertained at once with the delicacy of the colour, with the gracefulne&s;s of the figure, and &s;ometimes al&s;o with the motion of the object. Although each of the&s;e pro|duce a &s;eparate agreeable &s;en&s;ation, yet they are of &s;uch a &s;imilar nature, as readily to
<PB N="102" REF="108">
mix and blend in one general perception of Beauty, which we a&s;cribe to the whole ob|ject as its cau&s;e: For Beauty is always con|ceived by us, as &s;omething re&s;iding in the object which rai&s;es the plea&s;ant &s;en&s;ation; a &s;ort of glory which dwells upon, and inve&s;ts it. Perhaps the mo&s;t complete a&s;&s;emblage of beautiful objects that can any where be found, is pre&s;ented by a rich natural land|&s;cape, where there is a &s;ufficient variety of objects: fields in verdure, &s;cattered trees and flowers, running water, and animals graz|ing. If to the&s;e be joined, &s;ome of the pro|ductions of art, which &s;uit &s;uch a &s;cene; as a bridge with arches over a river, &s;moke ri&s;|ing from cottages in the mid&s;t of trees, and the di&s;tant view of a fine building &s;een by the ri&s;ing &s;un; we then enjoy, in the high|e&s;t perfection, that gay, cheerful, and placid &s;en&s;ation which characteri&s;es Beauty. To have an eye and a ta&s;te formed for catching the peculiar Beauties of &s;uch &s;cenes as the&s;e, is a nece&s;&s;ary requi&s;ite for all who attempt poetical de&s;cription.</P>
<P>THE Beauty of the human countenance is more complex than any that we have yet con&s;idered. It includes the Beauty of co|lour, ari&s;ing from the delicate &s;hades of the complexion; and the Beauty of figure, ari&s;|ing from the lines which form the different features of the face. But the chief Beauty of the countenance depends upon a my&s;te|rious expre&s;&s;ion, which it conveys of the
<PB N="103" REF="109">
qualities of the mind; of good &s;en&s;e, or good humour; of &s;prightline&s;s, candour, benevo|lence, &s;en&s;ibility, or other amiable di&s;po&s;iti|ons. How it comes to pa&s;s, that a certain conformation of features is connected in our idea with certain moral qualities; whether we are taught by in&s;tinct, or by experience, to form this connection, and to read the mind in the countenance; belongs not to us now to enquire, nor is indeed ea&s;y to re&s;olve. The fact is certain, and acknowledged, that what gives the human countenance its mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing Beauty, is what is called its expre&s;&s;ion; or an image, which it is conceiv|ed to &s;hew of internal moral di&s;po&s;itions.</P>
<P>THIS leads to ob&s;erve, that there are cer|tain qualities of the mind which, whether expre&s;&s;ed in the countenance, or by words, or by actions, always rai&s;e in us a feeling &s;i|milar to that of Beauty. There are two great cla&s;&s;es of moral qualities; one is of the high and the great virtues, which require extraor|dinary efforts, and turn upon dangers and &s;ufferings; as heroi&s;m, magnanimity, con|tempt of plea&s;ures, and contempt of death. The&s;e, as I have ob&s;erved in a former Lec|ture, excite in the &s;pectator an emotion of Sublimity and Grandeur. The other cla&s;s is generally of the &s;ocial virtues, and &s;uch as are of a &s;ofter and gentler kind; as compa&s;|&s;ion, mildne&s;s, friend&s;hip, and genero&s;ity. The&s;e rai&s;e in the beholder a &s;en&s;ation of plea&s;ure, &s;o much akin to that produced by
<PB N="104" REF="110">
Beautiful external objects, that, though of a more dignified nature, it may, without im|propriety, be cla&s;&s;ed under the &s;ame head.</P>
<P>A SPECIES of Beauty, di&s;tinct from any I have yet mentioned, ari&s;es from de&s;ign or art; or, in other words, from the perception of means being adapted to an end; or the parts of any thing being well fitted to an&s;wer the de&s;ign of the whole. When, in con&s;i|dering the &s;tructure of a tree or a plant, we ob&s;erve, how all the parts, the roots, the &s;tem, the bark, and the leaves, are &s;uited to the growth and nutriment of the whole: much more when we &s;urvey all the parts and members of a living animal; or when we examine any of the curious works of art; &s;uch as a clock, a &s;hip, or any nice machine; the plea&s;ure which we have in the &s;urvey, is wholly founded on this &s;en&s;e of Beauty. It is altogether different from the perception of Beauty produced by colour, figure, variety, or any of the cau&s;es formerly mentioned. When I look at a watch, for in&s;tance, the ca&s;e of it, if finely engraved, and of curious workman&s;hip, &s;trikes me as beautiful in the former &s;en&s;e; bright colour, exqui&s;ite poli&s;h, figures finely rai&s;ed and turned. But when I examine the con&s;truction of the &s;pring and the wheels, and prai&s;e the Beauty of the in|ternal machinery; my plea&s;ure then ari&s;es wholly from the view of that admirable art, with which &s;o many various and complicated parts are made to unite for one purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="111">
THIS &s;en&s;e of Beauty, in fitne&s;s and de|&s;ign, has an exten&s;ive influence over many of our ideas. It is the foundation of the Beauty which we di&s;cover in the proportion of doors, windows, arches, pillars, and all the orders of architecture. Let the orna|ments of a building be ever &s;o fine and ele|gant in them&s;elves, yet if they interfere with this &s;en&s;e of fitne&s;s and de&s;ign, they lo&s;e their Beauty, and hurt the eye, like di&s;agreeable objects. Twi&s;ted columns, for in&s;tance, are undoubtedly ornamental; but as they have an appearance of weakne&s;s, they always di&s;|plea&s;e when they are made u&s;e of to &s;upport any part of a building that is ma&s;&s;y, and that &s;eemed to require a more &s;ub&s;tantial prop. We cannot look upon any work whatever, without being led, by a natural a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, to think of its end and de&s;ign, and of cour&s;e to examine the propriety of its parts, in relation to this de&s;ign and end. When their propriety is clearly di&s;cerned, the work &s;eems always to have &s;ome Beauty; but when there is a total want of propriety, it never fails of appearing deformed. Our &s;en&s;e of fitne&s;s and de&s;ign, therefore, is &s;o powerful, and holds &s;o high a rank among our perceptions, as to regulate, in a great mea&s;ure, our other ideas of Beauty: An ob|&s;ervation which I the rather make, as it is of the utmo&s;t importance, that all who &s;tudy compo&s;ition &s;hould carefully attend to it. For, in an epic poem, a hi&s;tory, an oration, or any work of genius, we always require, as we do
<PB N="106" REF="112">
in other works, a fitne&s;s, or adju&s;tment of means, to the end which the author is &s;up|po&s;ed to have in view. Let his de&s;cription be ever &s;o rich, or his figures ever &s;o elegant, yet, if they are out of place, if they are not proper parts of that whole, if they &s;uit not the main de&s;ign, they lo&s;e all their Beauty; nay, from Beauties they are converted ino Deformities. Such power has our &s;en&s;e of fitne&s;s and congruity, to produce a total transformation of an object who&s;e appear|ance otherwi&s;e would have been Beautiful.</P>
<P>AFTER having mentioned &s;o many various &s;pecies of Beauty, it now only remains to take notice of Beauty as it is applied to writing or di&s;cour&s;e; a term commonly u&s;ed in a &s;en&s;e altogether loo&s;e and undetermined. For it is applied to all that plea&s;es, either in &s;tyle or in &s;entiment, from whatever principle that plea&s;ure flows; and a Beautiful poem or ora|tion means, in common language, no other than a good one, or one well compo&s;ed. In this &s;en&s;e, it is plain, the word is altogether indefinite, and points at no particular &s;pecies or kind of Beauty. There is, however, ano|ther &s;en&s;e, &s;omewhat more definite, in which Beauty of writing characteri&s;es a particular manner; when it is u&s;ed to &s;ignify a certain grace and amaenity in the turn either of &s;tyle or &s;entiment, for which &s;ome authors have been peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;hed. In this &s;en&s;e, it denotes a manner neither remarkably &s;u|blime, nor vehemently pa&s;&s;ionate, nor un|commonly
<PB N="107" REF="113">
&s;parkling; but &s;uch as rai&s;es in the reader an emotion of the gentle placid kind, &s;imilar to what is rai&s;ed by the con|templation of beautiful objects in nature; which neither lifts the mind very high, nor agitates it very much, but diffu&s;es over the imagination an agreeable and plea&s;ing &s;ere|nity. Mr. Addi&s;on is a writer altogether of this character; and is one of the mo&s;t pro|per and preci&s;e examples that can be given of it. Fenelon, the author of the Adven|tures of Telemachus, may be given as ano|ther example. Virgil too, though very ca|pable of ri&s;ing on occa&s;ions into the Sublime, yet, in his general manner, is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the character of Beauty and Grace rather than of Sublimity. Among orators, Cicero has more of the Beautiful than Demo&s;thenes, who&s;e genius led him wholly towards vehe|mence and &s;trength.</P>
<P>THIS much it is &s;ufficient to have &s;aid up|on the &s;ubject of Beauty. We have traced it through a variety of forms; as next to Su|blimity, it is the mo&s;t copious &s;ource of the Plea&s;ures of Ta&s;te; and as the con&s;ideration of the different appearances, and principles of Beauty, tends to the improvement of Ta&s;te in many &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>BUT it is not only by appearing under the forms of Sublime or Beautiful, that objects delight the imagination. From &s;everal other
<PB N="108" REF="114">
principles al&s;o, they derive their power of giving it plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>NOVELTY, for in&s;tance, has been menti|oned by Mr. Addi&s;on, and by every writer on this &s;ubject. An object which has no merit to recommend it, except its being un|common or new, by means of this quality alone, produces in the mind a vivid and an agreeable emotion. Hence that pa&s;&s;ion of curio&s;ity, which prevails &s;o generally among mankind. Objects and ideas which have been long familiar, make too faint an impre&s;|&s;ion to give an agreeable exerci&s;e to our facul|ties. New and &s;trange objects rou&s;e the mind from its dormant &s;tate, by giving it a quick and plea&s;ing impul&s;e. Hence, in a great mea&s;ure, the entertainment afforded us by fiction and romance. The emotion rai&s;ed by Novelty is of a more lively and pun|gent nature, than that produced by Beauty; but much &s;horter in its continuance. For if the object have in it&s;elf no charms to hold our attention, the &s;hining glo&s;s thrown upon it by Novelty &s;oon wears off.</P>
<P>BESIDES Novelty, Imitation is another &s;ource of Plea&s;ure to Ta&s;te. This gives ri&s;e to what Mr. Addi&s;on terms, the Secondary Plea&s;ures of Imagination; which form, doubt|le&s;s, a very exten&s;ive cla&s;s. For all Imitation affords &s;ome plea&s;ure; not only the Imitation of beautiful or great objects, by recalling the original ideas of Beauty or Grandeur which
<PB N="109" REF="115">
&s;uch objects them&s;elves exhibited; but even objects which have neither Beauty nor Gran|deur, nay, &s;ome which are terrible or deform|ed, plea&s;e us in a &s;econdary or repre&s;ented view.</P>
<P>THE Plea&s;ures of Melody and Harmony belong al&s;o to Ta&s;te. There is no agreeable &s;en&s;ation we receive, either from Beauty or Snblimity, but what is capable of being heightened by the power of mu&s;ical &s;ound. Whence the delight of poetical numbers; and even of the more concealed and loo&s;er mea&s;ures of pro&s;e. Wit, Humour, and Ri|dicule likewi&s;e open a variety of plea&s;ures to Ta&s;te, quite di&s;tinct from any that we have yet con&s;idered.</P>
<P>AT pre&s;ent it is not nece&s;&s;ary to pur&s;ue any farther the &s;ubject of the Plea&s;ures of Ta&s;te. I have opened &s;ome of the general principles; it is time now to make the appli|cation to our chief &s;ubject. If the que&s;tion be put, To what cla&s;s of tho&s;e Plea&s;ures of Ta&s;te which I have enumerated, that Plea|&s;ure is to be referred, which we receive from poetry, eloquence, or fine writing? My an|&s;wer is, Not to any one, but to them all. This &s;ingular advantage, writing and di&s;|cour&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;s, that they encompa&s;s &s;o large and rich a field on all &s;ides, and have power to exhibit, in great perfection, not a &s;ingle &s;et of objects only, but almo&s;t the whole of tho&s;e which give Plea&s;ure to Ta&s;te and Ima|gination;
<PB N="110" REF="116">
whether that Plea&s;ure ari&s;e from Su|blimity, from Beauty in its different forms, from De&s;ign and Art, from Moral Sentiment, from Novelty, from Harmony, from Wit, Humour and Ridicule. To which&s;oever of the&s;e the peculiar bent of a per&s;on's Ta&s;te lies, from &s;ome writer or other, he has it al|ways in his power to receive the gratification of it.</P>
<P>NOW this high power which eloquence and poetry po&s;&s;e&s;s, of &s;upplying Ta&s;te and Imagination with &s;uch a wide circle of plea|&s;ures, they derive altogether from their hav|ing a greater capacity of Imitation and De|&s;cription than is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by any other art. Of all the means which human ingenuity has contrived for recalling the images of real ob|jects, and awakening, by repre&s;entation, &s;i|milar emotions to tho&s;e which are rai&s;ed by the original, none is &s;o full and exten&s;ive as that which is executed by words and writing. Through the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of this happy inven|tion, there is nothing, either in the natural or moral world, but what can be repre&s;ented and &s;et before the mind, in colours very &s;trong and lively. Hence it is u&s;ual among critical writers, to &s;peak of Di&s;cour&s;e as the chief of all the imitative or mimetic arts; they compare it with painting and with &s;culp|ture, and in many re&s;pects prefer it ju&s;tly be|fore them.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="117">
THIS &s;tyle was fir&s;t introduced by Ari&s;totle in his Poetics; and &s;ince his time, has acquir|ed a general currency among modern authors. But, as it is of con&s;equence to introduce as much preci&s;ion as po&s;&s;ible into critical lan|guage, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that this manner of &s;peaking is not accurate. Neither di&s;cour&s;e in general, nor poetry in particular, can be called altogether imitative arts. We mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt Imitation and De&s;cription, which are ideas that &s;hould not be confound|ed. Imitation is performed by means of &s;omewhat that has a natural likene&s;s and re|&s;emblance to the thing imitated, and of con|&s;equence is under&s;tood by all; &s;uch are &s;ta|tues and pictures. De&s;cription, again, is the rai&s;ing in the mind the conception of an ob|ject by means of &s;ome arbitrary or in&s;tituted &s;ymbols, under&s;tood only by tho&s;e who agree in the in&s;titution of them; &s;uch are words and writing. Words have no natural re&s;em|blance to the ideas or objects which they are employed to &s;ignify; but a &s;tatue or a picture has a natural likene&s;s to the original. And therefore Imitation and De&s;cription differ con&s;iderably in their nature from each other.</P>
<P>AS far, indeed, as a poet or a hi&s;torian in|troduces into his work per&s;ons actually &s;peak|ing; and by the words which he puts into their mouths, repre&s;ents the di&s;cour&s;e which they might be &s;uppo&s;ed to hold; &s;o far his art may more accurately be called Imitative: and this is the ca&s;e in all dramatic compo&s;iti|on.
<PB N="112" REF="118">
But in Narrative or De&s;criptive works, it can with no propriety be called &s;o. Who, for in&s;tance, would call Virgil's De&s;cription of a tempe&s;t, in the fir&s;t Aeneid, an Imitation of a &s;torm? If we heard of the Imitation of a battle, we might naturally think of &s;ome mock fight, or repre&s;entation of a battle on the &s;tage, but would never apprehend, that it meant one of Homer's De&s;criptions in the Iliad. I admit, at the &s;ame time, that Imita|tion and De&s;cription agree in their principal effect, of recalling by external &s;igns, the ideas of things which we do not &s;ee. But though in this they coincide, yet it &s;hould not be forgotten, that the terms them&s;elves are not &s;ynonymous; that they import different means of effecting the &s;ame end; and of cour&s;e make different impre&s;&s;ions on the mind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though, in the execution of particular parts, Poetry is certainly De&s;criprive rather than Imitative, yet there is a qua|lified &s;en&s;e in which Poetry, in the general, may be termed an Imitative art. The &s;ubject of the poet (as Dr. Gerard has &s;hown in the Appendix to his E&s;&s;ay on Ta&s;te) is intended to be an Imitation, not of things really exi&s;ting, but of the cour&s;e of nature; that is, a feigned repre&s;entation of &s;uch events, or &s;uch &s;cenes, as though they never had a being, yet might have exi&s;ted; and which, therefore, by their probability, bear a re|&s;emblance to nature. It was probably, in this &s;en&s;e, that A|ri&s;totle termed Poetry a mimetic art. How far either the Imi|tation or the De&s;cription which Poetry employs, is &s;uperior to the imitative powers of Painting and Mu&s;ic, is well &s;hown by Mr. Harris, in his Treati&s;e on Mu&s;ic, Painting, and Poetry. The chief advantage which Poetry, or Di&s;cour&s;e in general en|joys is, that whereas, by the nature of his art, the Painter is confined to the repre&s;entation or a &s;ingle moment, writing and di&s;cour&s;e can trace a tran&s;action through its whole progre&s;s. That moment, indeed, which the painter pitches upon for the &s;ubject of his picture, he may be &s;aid to exhibit with more ad|vantage than the poet or the orator; ina&s;much as he &s;ets be|fore us, in one view, all the minute concurrent circum&s;tances of the event which happen in one individual point of time, as they appear in nature; while Di&s;cour&s;e is obliged to exhibit them in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and by means of a detail, which is in dan|ger of becoming tedious, in order to be clear; or if not tedi|ous, is in danger of being ob&s;cure. But to that point of time which he has cho&s;en, the painter being entirely confined, he cannot exhibit various &s;tages of the &s;ame action or event; and he is &s;ubject to this farther defect, that he can only exhibit ob|jects as they appear to the eye, and can very imperfectly deli|neate characters and &s;entiments, which are the noble&s;t &s;ubjects of Imitation or De&s;cription. The power of repre&s;enting the&s;e with full advantage, gives a high &s;uperiority to Di&s;cour&s;e and Writing above all other imitative arts.</NOTE>.</P>

WHETHER we con&s;ider Poetry in particu|lar, and Di&s;cour&s;e in general, as Imitative or De&s;criptive; it is evident, that their whole power, in recalling the impre&s;&s;ions of real objects, is derived from the &s;ignificancy of words.

LANGUAGE, in general, &s;ignifies the ex|pre&s;&s;ion of our ideas by certain articulate &s;ounds, which are u&s;ed as the &s;igns of tho&s;e ideas. By articulate &s;ounds, are meant tho&s;e modulations of &s;imple voice, or of &s;ound emitted from the thorax, which are formed by means of the mouth and its &s;everal organs, the teeth, the tongue, the lips, and the pa|late. How far there is any natural connex|ion between the ideas of the mind and the &s;ounds emitted, will appear from what I am afterwards to offer. But as the natural con|nexion can, upon any &s;y&s;tem, affect only a &s;mall part of the fabric of Language; the connexion between words and ideas may, in general, be con&s;idered as arbitrary and con|ventional, owing to the agreement of men among them&s;elves; the clear proof of which is, that different nations have different Lan|guages, or a different &s;et of articulate &s;ounds, which they have cho&s;en for communicating their ideas.</P>
<P>THIS artificial method of communicating thought, we now behold carried to the high|e&s;t

perfection. Language is become a vehi|cle by which the mo&s;t delicate and refined emotions of one mind can be tran&s;mitted, or, if we may &s;o &s;peak, transfu&s;ed into another. Not only are names given to all objects around us, by which means an ea&s;y and &s;peedy intercour&s;e is carried on for provid|ing the nece&s;&s;aries of life, but all the relati|ons and differences among the&s;e objects are minutely marked, the invi&s;ible &s;entiments of the mind are de&s;cribed, the mo&s;t ab&s;tract notions and conceptions are rendered intelli|gible; and all the ideas which &s;cience can di&s;cover, or imagination create, are known by their proper names. Nay, Language has been carried &s;o far, as to be made an in&s;tru|ment of the mo&s;t refined luxury. Not re&s;t|ing in mere per&s;picuity, we require orna|ment al&s;o; not &s;atisfied with having the conceptions of others made known to us, we make a farther demand, to have them &s;o decked and adorned as to entertain our fan|cy; and this demand, it is found very po&s;&s;i|ble to gratify. In this &s;tate, we now find Language. In this &s;tate, it has been found among many nations for &s;ome thou&s;and years. The object is become familiar; and, like the expan&s;e of the firmament, and other great objects, which we are accu&s;tomed to behold, we behold it without wonder.</P>
<P>BUT carry your thoughts back to the fir&s;t dawn of Language among men. Reflect upon the feeble beginnings from which it
<PB N="117" REF="123">
mu&s;t have ari&s;en, and upon the many and great ob&s;tacles which it mu&s;t have encoun|tered in its progre&s;s; and you will find rea|&s;on for the highe&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment, on viewing the height which it has now attained. We admire &s;everal of the inventions of art; we plume our&s;elves on &s;ome di&s;coveries which have been made in latter ages, &s;erving to ad|vance knowledge, and to render life com|fortable; we &s;peak of them as the boa&s;t of human rea&s;on. But certainly no invention is entitled to any &s;uch degree of admiration as that of Language; which, too mu&s;t have been the product of the fir&s;t and rude&s;t ages, if indeed it can be con&s;idered as a human in|vention at all.</P>
<P>THINK of the circum&s;tances of mankind when Languages began to be formed. They were a wandering &s;cattered race; no &s;ociety among them except families; and the family &s;ociety too very imperfect, as their method of living by hunting or pa&s;turage mu&s;t have &s;e|parated them frequently from one another. In this &s;ituation, when &s;o much divided, and their intercour&s;e &s;o rare, How could any one &s;et of &s;ounds, or words, be generally agreed on as the &s;igns of their ideas? Suppo&s;ing that a few, whom chance or nece&s;&s;ity threw to|gether, agreed by &s;ome means upon certain &s;igns, yet by what authority could the&s;e be propagated among other tribes or families, &s;o as to &s;pread and grow up into a Language? One would think, that in order to any Lan|guage
<PB N="118" REF="124">
fixing and extending it&s;elf, men mu&s;t have been previou&s;ly gathered together in con&s;iderable numbers; &s;ociety mu&s;t have been already far advanced; and yet, on the other hand, there &s;eems to have been an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for Speech, previous to the forma|tion of Society. For, by what bond could any multitude of men be kept together, or be made to join in the pro&s;ecution of any common intere&s;t, until once, by the inter|vention of Speech, they could communicate their wants and intentions to each other? So that, either how Society could form it&s;elf, previou&s;ly to Language; or how words could ri&s;e into a Language, previou&s;ly to Society formed, &s;eem to be points attended with equal difficulty. And when we con&s;ider farther, that curious analogy which prevails in the con&s;truction of almo&s;t all Languages, and that deep and &s;ubtile logic on which they are founded, difficulties increa&s;e &s;o much upon us, on all hands, that there &s;eems to be no &s;mall rea&s;on for referring the fir&s;t origin of all Language to divine teaching or in&s;pira|tion.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uppo&s;ing Language to have a Divine original, we cannot, however, &s;uppo&s;e, that a perfect &s;y&s;tem of it was all at once given to man. It is much more natural to think, that God taught our fir&s;t parents only &s;uch Language as &s;uited their pre&s;ent occa&s;ions; leaving them, as he did in other things, to enlarge and improve it as their future nece&s;|&s;ities
<PB N="119" REF="125">
&s;hould require. Con&s;equently, tho&s;e fir&s;t rudiments of Speech mu&s;t have been poor and narrow; and we are at full liberty to enquire in what manner, and by what &s;teps, Language advanced to the &s;tate in which we now find it. The hi&s;tory which I am to give of this progre&s;s, will &s;ugge&s;t &s;e|veral things, both curious in them&s;elves, and u&s;eful in our future di&s;qui&s;itions.</P>
<P>IF we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e a period before any words were invented or known, it is clear, that men could have no other method of communicating to others what they felt, than by the cries of pa&s;&s;ion, accompanied with &s;uch motions and ge&s;tures as were farther expre&s;&s;ive of pa&s;&s;ion. For the&s;e are the only &s;igns which nature teaches all men, and which are under&s;tood by all. One who &s;aw another going into &s;ome place where he him&s;elf had been frightened, or expo&s;ed to danger, and who &s;ought to warn his neighbour of the danger, could contrive no other way of do|ing &s;o, than by uttering tho&s;e cries, and mak|ing tho&s;e ge&s;tures, which are the &s;igns of fear: ju&s;t as two men, at this day, would endeavour to make them&s;elves be under&s;tood by each other, who &s;hould be thrown toge|ther on a de&s;olate i&s;land, ignorant of one an|other's Language. Tho&s;e exclamations, there|fore, which by Grammarians are called Inter|jections, uttered in a &s;trong and pa&s;&s;ionate manner, were, beyond doubt, the fir&s;t ele|ments or beginnings of Speech.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="126">
WHEN more enlarged communication be|came nece&s;&s;ary, and names began to be a&s;|&s;igned to objects, in what manner can we &s;uppo&s;e men to have proceeded in this a&s;&s;ign|ation of names, or invention of words? Un|doubtedly, by imitating, as much as they could, the nature of the object which they named, by the &s;ound of the name which they gave to it. As a Painter, who would repre|&s;ent gra&s;s, mu&s;t employ a green colour; &s;o, in the beginnings of Language, one giving a name to any thing har&s;h or boi&s;terous, would of cour&s;e employ a har&s;h or boi&s;terous &s;ound. He could not do otherwi&s;e, if he meant to excite in the hearer the idea of that thing which he &s;ought to name. To &s;uppo&s;e words invented, or names given, to things, in a manner purely arbitrary, without any ground or rea&s;on, is to &s;uppo&s;e an effect without a cau&s;e. There mu&s;t have always been &s;ome motive which led to the a&s;&s;ignation of one name rather than another; and we can con|ceive no motive which would more univer|&s;ally operate upon men in their fir&s;t efforts towards Language, than a de&s;ire to paint by Speech, the objects which they named, in a manner more or le&s;s complete, according as the vocal organs had it in their power to ef|fect this imitation.</P>
<P>WHEREVER objects were to be named, in which &s;ound, noi&s;e, or motion were concern|ed, the imitation by words was abundantly obvious. Nothing was more natural, than
<PB N="121" REF="127">
to imitate, by the &s;ound of the voice, the quality of the &s;ound or noi&s;e which any ex|ternal object made; and to form its name accordingly. Thus, in all Languages, we find a multitude of words that are evidently con&s;tructed upon this principle. A certain bird is termed the Cuckoo, from the &s;ound which it emits. When one &s;ort of wind is &s;aid to <HI>whi&s;tle,</HI> and another to <HI>roar;</HI> when a &s;erpent is &s;aid to <HI>hi&s;s;</HI> a fly to <HI>buz,</HI> and fall|ing timber to <HI>cra&s;h;</HI> when a &s;tream is &s;aid to <HI>flow,</HI> and hail to <HI>rattle;</HI> the analogy between the word and the thing &s;ignified is plainly di&s;|cernible.</P>
<P>IN the names of objects which addre&s;s the &s;ight only, where neither noi&s;e nor motion are concerned, and &s;till more in the terms appropriated to moral ideas, this analogy ap|pears to fail. Many learned men, however, have been of opinion, that though, in &s;uch ca&s;es, it becomes more ob&s;cure, yet it is not altogether lo&s;t; but that throughout the ra|dical words of all Languages, there may be traced &s;ome degree of corre&s;pondence with the object &s;ignified. Witn regard to moral and intellectual ideas, they remark, that, in every Language, the terms &s;ignificant of them, are derived from the names of &s;en&s;i|ble objects to which they are conceived to be analogous; and with regard to &s;en&s;ible ob|jects pertaining merely to &s;ight, they remark, that their mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing qualities have certain radical &s;ounds appropriated to the
<PB N="122" REF="128">
expre&s;&s;ion of them, in a great variety of Languages. Stability, for in&s;tance, fluidity, hollowne&s;s, &s;moothne&s;s, gentlene&s;s, violence, &amp;c. they imagine to be painted by the &s;ound of certain letters or &s;yllables, which have &s;ome relation to tho&s;e different &s;tates of vi&s;i|ble objects, on account of an ob&s;cure re&s;em|blance which the organs of voice are capa|ble of a&s;&s;uming to &s;uch external qualities. By this natural mechani&s;m, they imagine all Languages to have been at fir&s;t con&s;tructed, and the roots of their capital words formed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Author, who has carried his &s;peculations on this &s;ubject the farthe&s;t, is the Pre&s;ident Des Bro&s;&s;es, in his "Trait&eacute; de la Formation Mechanique des Langues." Some of the radical letters or &s;yllables which he &s;uppo&s;es to carry this ex|pre&s;&s;ive power in mo&s;t known Languages are, St, to &s;ignify &s;tability or re&s;t; Fl, to denote fluency; Cl, a gentle de&s;cent; R, what relates to rapid motion; C, to cavity or hollowne&s;s, &amp;c. A century before his time, Dr. Wallis, in his Grammar of the Engli&s;h Language, had taken notice of the&s;e &s;ignificant roots, and repre&s;ented it as a peculiar excellency of our Tongue, that, beyond all others, it expre&s;&s;ed the nature of the objects which it names, by employing &s;ounds &s;harper, &s;oft|er, weaker, &s;tronger, more ob&s;cure, or more &s;tridulous, ac|cording as the idea which is to be &s;ugge&s;ted requires. He gives various examples. Thus; words formed upon St, always denote firmne&s;s and &s;trength, analogous to the Latin <HI>&s;to;</HI> as, &s;tand, &s;tay, &s;taff, &s;top, &s;tout, &s;teady, &s;take, &s;tamp, &s;tallion, &s;tately, &amp;c. Words beginning with Str, intimate violent force, and energy, analogous to the Greek <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">; as, &s;trive, &s;trength, &s;trike, &s;tripe, &s;tre&s;s, &s;truggle, &s;tride, &s;tretch, &s;trip, &amp;c. Thr, implies forcible motion; as, throw, throb, thru&s;t, through, threaten, thraldom. Wr, obliquity or di&s;tortion; as, wry, wre&s;t, wreath, wre&s;tle, wring, wrong, wrangle, wrath, wrack, &amp;c. Sw, &s;ilent agitation, or lateral motion; as, &s;way, &s;wing, &s;werve, &s;weep, &s;wim. Sl, a gentle fall or le&s;s ob&s;ervable motion; as, &s;lide, &s;lip, &s;ly, &s;lit, &s;low, &s;lack, &s;ling. Sp, di&s;&s;ipation or expan&s;ion; as, &s;pread, &s;prout, &s;prin|kle, &s;plit, &s;pill, &s;pring. Terminations in A&s;h, indicate &s;ome|thing acting nimbly and &s;harply; as cra&s;h, ga&s;h, ra&s;h, fla&s;h, la&s;h, &s;la&s;h.

AS far as this &s;y&s;tem is founded in truth, Language appears to be not altogether arbi|trary in its origin.

THIS principle, however, of a natural re|lation between words and objects, can only be applied to Language in its mo&s;t &s;imple and primitive &s;tate. Though, in every Tongue, &s;ome remains of it, as I have &s;hewn above, can be traced, it were utterly in vain to &s;earch for it throughout the whole con&s;truction of any modern Language. As the multitude of terms increa&s;e in every nation, and the im|men&s;e field of Language is filled up, words, by a thou&s;and fanciful and irregular methods of derivation and compo&s;ition, come to de|viate widely from the primitive character of their roots, and to lo&s;e all analogy or re&s;em|blance in &s;ound to the things &s;ignified. In this &s;tate we now find Language. Words, as we now employ them, taken in the gene|ral, may be con&s;idered as &s;ymbols, not as imitations; as arbitrary, or in&s;tituted, not natural &s;igns of ideas. But there can be no doubt, I think, that Language, the nearer we remount to its ri&s;e among men, will be found to partake more of a natural expre&s;&s;i|on. As it could be originally formed on no|thing but imitation, it would, in its primi|tive &s;tate, be more picture&s;que; much more barren indeed, and narrow in the circle of its terms, than now; but &s;o far as it went, more expre&s;&s;ive by &s;ound of the thing &s;igni|fied. This, then, may be a&s;&s;umed as one

character of the fir&s;t &s;tate, or beginnings, of Language, among every &s;avage tribe.</P>
<P>A SECOND character of Language, in its early &s;tate, is drawn from the manner in which words were at fir&s;t pronounced, or ut|tered, by men. Interjections, I &s;howed, or pa&s;&s;ionate exclamations, were the fir&s;t ele|ments of Speech. Men laboured to com|municate their feelings to one another, by tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ive cries and ge&s;tures which na|ture taught them. After words, or names of objects, began to be invented, this mode of &s;peaking, by natural &s;igns, could not be all at once di&s;u&s;ed. For Language, in its in|fancy, mu&s;t have been extremely barren; and there certainly was a period, among all rude nations, when conver&s;ation was carried on by a very few words, intermixed with many exclamations and earne&s;t ge&s;tures. The &s;mall &s;tock of words which men as yet po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, rendered tho&s;e helps ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary for explaining their conceptions; and rude, uncultivated men, not having always at hand even the few words which they knew, would naturally labour to make them&s;elves under&s;tood, by varying their tones of voice, and accompanying their tones with the mo&s;t &s;ignificant ge&s;ticulations they could make. At this day, when per&s;ons attempt to &s;peak in any Language which they po&s;&s;e&s;s imper|fectly, they have recour&s;e to all the&s;e &s;upple|mental methods, in order to render them|&s;elves more intelligible. The plan too, ac|cording
<PB N="126" REF="132">
to which I have &s;hown, that Lan|guage was originally con&s;tructed, upon re|&s;emblance or analogy, as far as was po&s;&s;ible, to the thing &s;ignified, would naturally lead men to utter their words with more empha&s;is and force, as long as Language was a &s;ort of painting by means of &s;ound. For all tho&s;e rea&s;ons this may be a&s;&s;umed as a principle, that the pronunciation of the earlie&s;t Lan|guages was accompanied with more ge&s;ticu|lation, and with more and greater inflexions of voice, than what we now u&s;e; there was more action in it; and it was more upon a crying or &s;inging tone.</P>
<P>To this manner of &s;peaking, nece&s;&s;ity fir&s;t gave ri&s;e. But we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that, after this nece&s;&s;ity had, in a great mea&s;ure, cea&s;ed, by Language becoming, in proce&s;s of time, more exten&s;ive and copious, the antient man|ner of Speech &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted among many na|tions; and what had ari&s;en from nece&s;&s;ity, continued to be u&s;ed for ornament. Where|ver there was much fire and vivacity in the genius of nations, they were naturally inclin|ed to a mode of conver&s;ation which gratified the imagination &s;o much; for, an imaginati|on which is warm, is always prone to throw both a great deal of action, and a variety of tones, into di&s;cour&s;e. Upon this princi|ple, Dr. Warburton accounts for &s;o much &s;peaking by action, as we find among the Old Te&s;tament Prophets; as when Jeremiah breaks the potter's ve&s;&s;el, in &s;ight of the peo|ple;
<PB N="127" REF="133">
throws a book into the Euphrates; puts on bonds and yokes; and carries out his hou&s;ehold &s;tuff; all which, he imagines, might be &s;ignificant modes of expre&s;&s;ion, very na|tural in tho&s;e ages, when men were accu&s;tom|ed to explain them&s;elves &s;o much by actions and ge&s;tures. In like manner, among the Northern American tribes, certain motions and actions were found to be much u&s;ed as explanatory of their meaning, on all their great occa&s;ions of intercour&s;e with each other; and by the belts and &s;trings of wampum, which they gave and received, they were ac|cu&s;tomed to declare their meaning, as much as by their di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P>WITH regard to inflexions of voice, the&s;e are &s;o natural, that, to &s;ome nations, it has appeared ea&s;ier to expre&s;s different ideas, by varying the tone with which they pronounced the &s;ame word, than to contrive words for all their ideas. This is the practice of the Chine&s;e in particular. The number of words in their Language is &s;aid not to be great; but, in &s;peaking, they vary each of their words on no le&s;s than five different tones, by which they make the &s;ame word &s;ignify five different things. This mu&s;t give a great appearance of mu&s;ic or &s;inging to their Speech. For tho&s;e inflexions of voice which, in the infancy of Language, were no more than har&s;h or di&s;&s;onant cries, mu&s;t, as Language gradually poli&s;hes, pa&s;s into more &s;mooth and
<PB N="128" REF="134">
mu&s;ical &s;ounds; and hence is formed, what we call, the Pro&s;ody of a Language.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, and de&s;erves attention, that, both in the Greek and Roman Lan|guages, this mu&s;ical and ge&s;ticulating pro|nunciation was retained in a very high de|gree. Without having attended to this, we will be at a lo&s;s in under&s;tanding &s;everal pa&s;|&s;ages of the Cla&s;&s;ics, which relate to the pub|lic &s;peaking, and the theatrical entertain|ments, of the antients. It appears, from many circum&s;tances, that the pro&s;ody both of the Greeks and Romans, was carried much farther than ours; or that they &s;poke with more, and &s;tronger, inflexions of voice than we u&s;e. The quantity of their &s;ylla|bles was much more fixed than in any of the modern Languages, and rendered much more &s;en&s;ible to the ear in pronouncing them. Be&s;ides quantities, or the difference of &s;hort and long, accents were placed upon mo&s;t of their &s;yllables, the acute, grave, and circum|flex; the u&s;e of which accents we have now entirely lo&s;t, but which, we know, determi|ned the &s;peaker's voice to ri&s;e or fall. Our modern pronunciation mu&s;t have appeared to them a lifele&s;s monotony. The declamation of their orators, and the pronunciation of their actors upon the &s;tage, approached to the nature of recitative in mu&s;ic; was capable of being marked in notes, and &s;upported with in&s;truments; as &s;everal learned men have fully proved. And if this was the ca&s;e, as
<PB N="129" REF="135">
they have &s;hown, among the Romans, the Greeks, it is well known, were &s;till a more mu&s;ical people than the Romans, and carried their attention to tone and pronunciation much farther in every public exhibition. A|ri&s;totle, in his Po&euml;tics, con&s;iders the mu&s;ic of Tragedy as one of its chief and mo&s;t e&s;|&s;ential parts.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e was parallel with regard to ge&s;|tures: for &s;trong tones, and animated ge&s;|tures, we may ob&s;erve, always go together. Action is treated of by all the antient critics, as the chief quality in every public &s;peaker. The action, both of the orators and the players in Greece and Rome, was far more vehement than what we are accu&s;tomed to. Ro&s;cius would have &s;eemed a madman to us. Ge&s;ture was of &s;uch con&s;equence upon the antient &s;tage, that there is rea&s;on for believ|ing, that, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, the &s;peaking and the acting part were divided, which, ac|cording to our ideas, would form a &s;trange exhibition; one player &s;poke the words in the proper tones, while another performed the corre&s;ponding motions and ge&s;tures. We learn from Cicero, that it was a conte&s;t be|tween him and Ro&s;cius, whether he could expre&s;s a &s;entiment in a greater variety of phra&s;es, or Ro&s;cius in a greater variety of in|telligible &s;ignificant ge&s;tures. At la&s;t, ge&s;|ture came to engro&s;s the &s;tage wholly; for, under the reigns of Augu&s;tus and Tiberius, the favourite entertainment of the Public
<PB N="130" REF="136">
was the pantomime, which was carried on entirely by mute ge&s;ticulation. The people were moved, and wept at it, as much as at tragedies; and the pa&s;&s;ion for it became &s;o &s;trong, that laws were obliged to be made, for re&s;training the Senators from &s;tudying the pantomime art. Now, though in declama|tions and theatrical exhibitions, both tone and ge&s;ture were, doubtle&s;s, carried much farther than in common di&s;cour&s;e; yet pub|lic &s;peaking, of any kind, mu&s;t, in every country, bear &s;ome proportion to the man|ner that is u&s;ed in conver&s;ation; and &s;uch public entertainments as I have now menti|oned, could never have been reli&s;hed by a nation, who&s;e tones and ge&s;tures, in di&s;|cour&s;e, were as languid as ours.</P>
<P>WHEN the Barbarians &s;pread them&s;elves over the Roman Empire, the&s;e more phleg|matic nations did not retain the accents, the tones and ge&s;tures, which nece&s;&s;ity at fir&s;t introduced, and cu&s;tom and fancy afterwards &s;o long &s;upported, in the Greek and Roman Languages. As the Latin Tongue was lo&s;t in their idioms, &s;o the character of &s;peech and pronunciation began to be changed throughout Europe. Nothing of the &s;ame attention was paid to the mu&s;ic of Language, or to the pomp of declamation, and theatri|cal action. Both conver&s;ation and public &s;peaking became more &s;imple and plain, &s;uch as we now find it; without that enthu&s;ia&s;tic mixture of tones and ge&s;tures, which di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
<PB N="131" REF="137">
the antient nations. At the re&s;tora|tion of letters, the genius of Language was &s;o much altered, and the manners of the people become &s;o different, that it was no ea&s;y matter to under&s;tand what the Antients had &s;aid, concerning their declamations and public &s;pectacles. Our plain manner of &s;peak|ing, in the&s;e northern countries, expre&s;&s;es the pa&s;&s;ions with &s;ufficient energy, to move tho&s;e who are not accu&s;tomed to any more vehement manner. But, undoubtedly, more varied tones, and more animated motions, carry a natural expre&s;&s;ion of warmer feel|ings. Accordingly, in different modern Lan|guages, the pro&s;ody of Speech partakes more of mu&s;ic, in proportion to the liveline&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility of the people. A Frenchman both varies his accents, and ge&s;ticulates while he &s;peaks, much more than an Engli&s;hman. An Italian, a great deal more than either. Mu|&s;ical pronunciation and expre&s;&s;ive ge&s;ture are, to this day, the di&s;tinction of Italy.</P>
<P>FROM the pronunciation of Language, let us proceed, in the third place, to con&s;ider of the Style of Language in its mo&s;t early &s;tate, and of its progre&s;s in this re&s;pect al&s;o. As the manner in which men at fir&s;t uttered their words, and maintained conver&s;ation, was &s;trong and expre&s;&s;ive, enforcing their imper|fectly expre&s;&s;ed ideas by cries and ge&s;tures; &s;o the Language which they u&s;ed, could be no other than full of figures and meta|phors,
<PB N="132" REF="138">
not correct indeed, but forcible and picture&s;que.</P>
<P>WE are apt, upon a &s;uperficial view, to imagine, that tho&s;e modes of expre&s;&s;ion which are called Figures of Speech, are among the chief refinements of Speech, not invented till after Language had advanced to its later pe|riods, and mankind were brought into a po|li&s;hed &s;tate; and that, then, they were de|vi&s;ed by Orators and Rhetoricians. The quite contrary of this is the truth. Mankind ne|ver employed &s;o many figures of Speech, as when they had hardly any words for expre&s;|&s;ing their meaning.</P>
<P>FOR fir&s;t, the want of proper names for every object, obliged them to u&s;e one name for many; and, of cour&s;e, to expre&s;s them|&s;elves by compari&s;ons, metaphors, allu&s;ions, and all tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tituted forms of Speech which render Language figurative. Next, as the objects with which they were mo&s;t con|ver&s;ant, were the &s;en&s;ible, material objects around them, names would be given to tho&s;e objects long before words were invented for &s;ignifying the di&s;po&s;itions of the mind, or any &s;ort of moral and intellectual ideas. Hence, the early Language of men being entirely made up of words de&s;criptive of &s;en&s;ible ob|jects, it became, of nece&s;&s;ity, extremely me|taphorical. For, to &s;ignify any de&s;ire or pa&s;|&s;ion, or any act or feeling of the mind, they had no preci&s;e expre&s;&s;ion which was appro|priated
<PB N="133" REF="139">
to that purpo&s;e, but were under a nece&s;&s;ity of painting the emotion, or pa&s;&s;ion, which they felt, by allu&s;ion to tho&s;e &s;en&s;ible objects which had mo&s;t relation to it, and which could render it, in &s;ome &s;ort, vi&s;ible to others.</P>
<P>BUT it was not nece&s;&s;ity alone, that gave ri&s;e to this figured &s;tyle. Other circum&s;tances al&s;o, at the commencement of Language, contributed to it. In the infancy of all &s;o|cieties, men are much under the dominion of imagination and pa&s;&s;ion. They live &s;cat|tered and di&s;per&s;ed; they are unacquainted with the cour&s;e of things; they are, every day, meeting with new and &s;trange objects. Fear and &s;urpri&s;e, wonder and a&s;toni&s;hment, are their mo&s;t frequent pa&s;&s;ions. Their Lan|guage will nece&s;&s;arily partake of this cha|racter of their minds. They will be prone to exaggeration and hyperbole. They will be given to de&s;cribe every thing with the &s;tronge&s;t colours, and mo&s;t vehement expre&s;|&s;ions; infinitely more than men living in the advanced and cultivated periods of Society, when their imagination is more cha&s;tened, their pa&s;&s;ions are more tamed, and a wider experience has rendered the objects of life more familiar to them. Even the manner in which I before &s;howed that the fir&s;t tribes of men uttered their words, would have con|&s;iderable influence on their &s;tyle. Wherever &s;trong exclamations, tones, and ge&s;tures, en|ter much into conver&s;ation, the imagination
<PB N="134" REF="140">
is always more exerci&s;ed; a greater effort of fancy and pa&s;&s;ion is excited. Con&s;equently, the fancy kept awake, and rendered more &s;prightly by this mode of utterance, operates upon &s;tyle, and enlivens it more.</P>
<P>THESE rea&s;onings are confirmed by un|doubted facts. The &s;tyle of all the mo&s;t early Languages, among nations who are in the fir&s;t and rude periods of Society, is found, without exception, to be full of figures; hy|perbolical and picture&s;que in a high degree. We have a &s;triking in&s;tance of this in the American Languages, which are known, by the mo&s;t authentic accounts, to be figurative to exce&s;s. The Iroquois and Illinois, carry on their treaties and public tran&s;actions with bolder metaphors, and greater pomp of &s;tyle, than we u&s;e in our poetical productions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thus, to give an in&s;tance of the &s;ingular &s;tyle of the&s;e nati|ons, the Five Nations of Canada, when entering on a treaty of peace with us, expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves by their Chiefs, in the following Language: <Q REND="inline">"We are happy in having buried un|der ground the red axe, that has &s;o often been dyed with the blood of our brethren. Now, in this fort, we inter the axe, and plant the tree of Peace. We plant a tree, who&s;e top will reach the Sun; and its branches &s;pread abroad, &s;o that it &s;hall be &s;een afar off. May its growth never be &s;tifled and choked; but may it &s;hade both your country and ours with its leaves! Let us make fa&s;t its roots, and extend them to the utmo&s;t of your colonies. If the French &s;hould come to &s;hake this tree, we would know it by the motion of its roots reaching into our country. May the Great Spirit allow us to re&s;t in tranquillity upon our matts, and never again dig up the axe to cut down the tree of Peace! Let the earth be trod hard over it, where it lies buried. Let a &s;trong &s;tream run under the pit, to wa&s;h the evil away out of our &s;ight and remembrance.&mdash;The fire that had long burned in Al|bany is extingui&s;hed. The bloody bed is wa&s;hed clean, and the tears are wiped from our eyes. We now renew the covenent chain of friend&s;hip. Let it be kept bright and clean as &s;ilver, and not &s;uffered to contract any ru&s;t. Let not any one pull away his arm from it."</Q> The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages are extracted from Cadwallader Colden's Hi&s;tory of the Five Indian Nations; where it appears, from the authentic documents he produces, that &s;uch is their genuine &s;tyle.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="141">
ANOTHER remarkable in&s;tance is, the &s;tyle of the Old Te&s;tament, which is carried on by con&s;tant allu&s;ions to &s;en&s;ible objects. In|iquity, or guilt, is expre&s;&s;ed by <Q REND="inline">"a &s;potted garment;"</Q> mi&s;ery, by <Q REND="inline">"drinking the cup of a&s;toni&s;hment;"</Q> vain pur&s;uits, by <Q REND="inline">"feed|ing on a&s;hes;"</Q> a &s;inful life, by <Q REND="inline">"a crooked path;"</Q> pro&s;perity, by <Q REND="inline">"the candle of the Lord &s;hining on our head;"</Q> and the like, in innumerable in&s;tances. Hence, we have been accu&s;tomed to call this &s;ort of &s;tyle, the Oriental Style; as fancying it to be peculiar to the nations of the Ea&s;t: Whereas, from the American Style, and from many other in&s;tances, it plainly appears not to have been peculiar to any one region or climate; but to have been common to all nations, in certain periods of Society and Language.</P>
<P>HENCE, we may receive &s;ome light con|cerning that &s;eeming paradox, that Poetry is more antient than Pro&s;e. I &s;hall have occa|&s;ion to di&s;cu&s;s this point fully hereafter, when I come to treat of the Nature and Origin of Poetry. At pre&s;ent, it is &s;ufficient to ob|&s;erve, that, from what has been &s;aid it plain|ly

appears, that the &s;tyle of all Language mu&s;t have been originally poetical; &s;trongly tinctured with that enthu&s;ia&s;m, and that de|&s;criptive, metaphorical expre&s;&s;ion, which di&s;|tingui&s;hes Poetry.</P>
<P>AS Language, in its progre&s;s, began to grow more copious, it gradually lo&s;t that fi|gurative &s;tyle, which was its early character. When men were furni&s;hed with proper and familiar names for every object, both &s;en&s;ible and moral, they were not obliged to u&s;e &s;o many circumlocutions. Style became more preci&s;e, and, of cour&s;e, more &s;imple. Ima|gination too, in proportion as Society ad|vanced, had le&s;s influence over mankind. The vehement manner of &s;peaking by tones and ge&s;tures, became not &s;o univer&s;al. The under&s;tanding was more exerci&s;ed; the fan|cy, le&s;s. Intercour&s;e among mankind be|coming more exten&s;ive and frequent, clear|ne&s;s of &s;tyle, in &s;ignifying their meaning to each other, was the chief object of atten|tion. In place of Poets, Philo&s;ophers became the in&s;tructors of men; and, in their rea&s;on|ings on all different &s;ubjects, introduced that plainer and &s;impler &s;tyle of compo&s;ition, which we now call Pro&s;e. Among the Greeks, Pherecydes of Scyros, the ma&s;ter of Pythagoras, is recorded to have been the fir&s;t, who, in this &s;en&s;e, compo&s;ed any writing in pro&s;e.

Suppo&s;ing him to have acquired words, the fir&s;t word which he uttered would, of cour&s;e, be the name of that object.

This was the exciting idea; the object which moved him to &s;peak; and, of cour&s;e, would be the fir&s;t named. Such an arrangement is pre|ci&s;ely putting into words the ge&s;ture which nature taught the Savage to make, before he was acquainted with words; and therefore it may be depended upon as certain, that he would fall mo&s;t readily into this arrange|ment.</P>
<P>ACCUSTOMED now to a different method of ordering our words, we call this an inver|&s;ion, and con&s;ider it as a forced and unnatu|ral order of Speech. But though not the mo&s;t logical, it is, however, in one view, the mo&s;t natural order; becau&s;e, it is the order &s;ugge&s;ted by imagination and de&s;ire, which always impel us to mention their object in the fir&s;t place. We might therefore con|clude, <HI>a priori,</HI> that this would be the order in which words were mo&s;t commonly ar|ranged at the beginnings of Language; and
<PB N="140" REF="146">
accordingly we find, in fact, that, in this or|der, words are arranged in mo&s;t of the anti|ent Tongues; as in the Greek and the La|tin; and it is &s;aid al&s;o, in the Ru&s;&s;ian, the the Sclavonic, the Ga&euml;lic, and &s;everal of the American Tongues.</P>
<P>IN the Latin Language, the arrangement which mo&s;t commonly obtains, is, to place fir&s;t, in the &s;entence, that word which ex|pre&s;&s;es the principal object of the di&s;cour&s;e, together with its circum&s;tances; and after|wards, the per&s;on, or the thing, that acts upon it. Thus Sallu&s;t, comparing together the mind and the body; <Q REND="inline">"Animi imperio, corporis &s;ervitio, magis utimur;"</Q> which order certainly renders the &s;entence more live|ly and &s;triking, than when it is arranged ac|cording to our Engli&s;h con&s;truction; <Q REND="inline">"We make mo&s;t u&s;e of the direction of the &s;oul, and of the &s;ervice of the body."</Q> The La|tin order gratifies more the rapidity of the imagination, which naturally runs fir&s;t to that which is its chief object; and having once named it, carries it in view throughout the re&s;t of the &s;entence. In the &s;ame man|ner in poetry:<Q><L>Ju&s;tum &amp; tenacem propo&s;iti virum,</L>
<L>Non civium ardor prava jubentium,</L>
<L>Non vultus in&s;tantis tyranni,</L>
<L>Mente quatit &s;olida.&mdash;</L></Q> Every per&s;on of ta&s;te mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that here the words are arranged with a much
<PB N="141" REF="147">
greater regard to the figure which the &s;everal objects make in the fancy, than our Engli&s;h con&s;truction admits; which would require the <Q REND="inline">"Ju&s;tum &amp; tenacem propo&s;iti virum,"</Q> though, undoubtedly, the capital object in the &s;entence, to be thrown into the la&s;t place.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;aid, that, in the Greek and Ro|man Languages, the mo&s;t common arrange|ment is, to place that fir&s;t which &s;trikes the imagination of the &s;peaker mo&s;t. I do not, however, pretend, that this holds without exception. Sometimes regard to the har|mony of the period requires a different order; and in Languages &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;o much mu|&s;ical beauty, and pronounced with &s;o much tone and modulation as were u&s;ed by tho&s;e nations, the harmony of periods was an ob|ject carefully &s;tudied. Sometimes too, at|tention to the per&s;picuity, to the force, or to the artful &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the &s;peaker's mean|ing, alter this order; and produce &s;uch va|rieties in the arrangement, that it is not ea&s;y to reduce them to any one principle. But, in general, this was the genius and character of mo&s;t of the antient Languages, to give &s;uch full liberty to the collocation of words, as allowed them to a&s;&s;ume whatever order was mo&s;t agreeable to the &s;peaker's imagina|tion. The Hebrew is, indeed, an excepti|on: which, though not altogether without inver&s;ions, yet employs them le&s;s frequently, and approaches nearer to the Engli&s;h con|&s;truction,
<PB N="142" REF="148">
than either the Greek or the La|tin.</P>
<P>ALL the modern Languages of Europe have adopted a different arrangement from the antient. In their pro&s;e compo&s;itions, very little variety is admitted in the colloca|tion of words; they are mo&s;tly fixed to one order; and that order is, what may be called, the Order of the Under&s;tanding. They place fir&s;t in the &s;entence, the per&s;on or thing which &s;peaks or acts; next, its action; and la&s;tly, the object of its action. So that the ideas are made to &s;ucceed to one another, not according to the degree of importance which the &s;everal objects carry in the imagination, but according to the order of nature and of time.</P>
<P>AN Engli&s;h writer, paying a compliment to a great man, would &s;ay thus: <Q REND="inline">"It is im|po&s;&s;ible for me to pa&s;s over, in &s;ilence, &s;uch remarkable mildne&s;s, &s;uch &s;ingular and un|heard of clemency, and &s;uch unu&s;ual mo|deration, in the exerci&s;e of &s;upreme pow|er."</Q> Here we have, fir&s;t pre&s;ented to us, the per&s;on who &s;peaks. <Q REND="inline">"It is impo&s;&s;ible for <HI>me;</HI>"</Q> next, what that per&s;on is to do, <Q REND="inline">"impo&s;&s;ible for him <HI>to pa&s;s over in &s;ilence;</HI>"</Q> and la&s;tly, the object which moves him &s;o to do, <Q REND="inline">"the mildne&s;s, clemency, and modera|tion of his patron."</Q> Cicero, from whom I have tran&s;lated the&s;e words, ju&s;t rever&s;es this order; beginning with the object, plac|ing
<PB N="143" REF="149">
that fir&s;t which was the exciting idea in the &s;peaker's mind, and ending with the &s;peaker and his action. <Q REND="inline">"Tantam man&s;ue|tudinem, tam inu&s;itatam inauditamque cle|mentiam, tantumque in &s;umma pote&s;tate rerum omnium modum, tacitus multo modo praeterire po&s;&s;um." <BIBL>(Orat. pro Mar|cell.)</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>THE Latin order is more animated; the Engli&s;h, more clear and di&s;tinct. The Ro|mans generally arranged their words accord|ing to the order in which the ideas ro&s;e in the &s;peaker's imagination. We arrange them according to the order in which the under|&s;tanding directs tho&s;e ideas to be exhibited, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, to the view of another. Our arrangement, therefore, appears to be the con&s;equence of greater refinement in the art of Speech; as far as clearne&s;s in communi|cation is under&s;tood to be the end of Speech.</P>
<P>IN poetry, where we are &s;uppo&s;ed to ri&s;e above the ordinary &s;tyle, and to &s;peak the Language of fancy and pa&s;&s;ion, our arrange|ment is not altogether &s;o limited; but &s;ome greater liberty is allowed for tran&s;po&s;ition, and inver&s;ion. Even there, however, that liberty is confined within narrow bounds, in compari&s;on of the Antient Languages. The different modern Tongues vary from one another, in this re&s;pect. The French Lan|guage is, of them all, the mo&s;t determinate in the order of its words, and admits the
<PB N="144" REF="150">
lea&s;t of inver&s;ion, either in pro&s;e or poetry The Engli&s;h admits it more. But the Itali|an retains the mo&s;t of the antient tran&s;po&s;i|tive character; though one is apt to think, at the expence of a little ob&s;curity in the &s;tyle of &s;ome of their authors, who deal mo&s;t in the&s;e tran&s;po&s;itions.</P>
<P>IT is proper, next, to ob&s;erve, that there is one circum&s;tance in the &s;tructure of all the modern Tongues, which, of nece&s;&s;ity, limits their arrangement, in a great mea&s;ure, to one fixed and determinate train. We have di&s;u&s;ed tho&s;e differences of termination, which, in the Greek and Latin, di&s;tingui&s;hed the &s;everal ca&s;es of nouns, and ten&s;es of verbs; and which, thereby, pointed out the mutual relation of the &s;everal words in a &s;en|tence to one another, though the related words were disjoined, and placed in different parts of the &s;entence. This is an alteration in the &s;tructure of Language, of which I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;ay more in the next Lecture. One obvious effect of it is, that we have now, for the mo&s;t part, no way left us to &s;hew the clo&s;e relation of any two words to one another in meaning, but by placing them clo&s;e to one another in the pe|riod. For in&s;tance; the Romans could, with propriety, expre&s;s them&s;elves thus;
<Q><L>Extinctum nymphae crudeli funere Daphnim</L>
<L>Flebant.&mdash;</L></Q>
<PB N="145" REF="151">
Becau&s;e <Q REND="inline">"Extinctum &amp; Daphnim,"</Q> being both in the accu&s;ative ca&s;e, this &s;howed, that the adjective and the &s;ub&s;tantive were related to each other, though placed at the two ex|tremities of the line; and that both were governed by the active verb <Q REND="inline">"Flebant,"</Q> to which <Q REND="inline">"nymphae"</Q> plainly appeared to be the nominative. The different terminations here reduced all into order, and made the connec|tion of the &s;everal words perfectly clear. But let us tran&s;late the&s;e words literally into Engli&s;h, according to the Latin arrange|ment; <Q REND="inline">"Dead the nymphs by a cruel fate Daphnis lamented;"</Q> and they become a perfect riddle, in which it is impo&s;&s;ible to find any meaning.</P>
<P>IT was by means of this contrivance, which obtained in almo&s;t all the antient Lan|guages, of varying the termination of nouns and verbs, and thereby pointing out the con|cordance and the government of the words, in a &s;entence, that they enjoyed &s;o much liberty of tran&s;po&s;ition, and could mar&s;hal and arrange their words in any way that gra|tified the imagination, or plea&s;ed the ear. When Language came to be modelled by the northern nations who overran the empire, they dropped the ca&s;es of nouns, and the different termination of verbs, with the more ea&s;e, becau&s;e they placed no great value upon the advantages ari&s;ing from &s;uch a &s;tructure of Language. They were attentive only to clearne&s;s, and copiou&s;ne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion. They
<PB N="146" REF="152">
neither regarded much the harmony of &s;ound, nor &s;ought to gratify the imagination by the collocation of words. They &s;tudied &s;olely to expre&s;s them&s;elves in &s;uch a manner as &s;hould exhibit their ideas to others in the mo&s;t di&s;tinct and intelligible order. And hence, if our Language, by rea&s;on of the &s;imple ar|rangement of its words, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es le&s;s har|mony, le&s;s beauty, and le&s;s force, than the Greek or Latin; it is, however, in its mean|ing, more obvious and plain.</P>
<P>THUS I have &s;hewn what the natural Pro|gre&s;s of Language has been, in &s;everal mate|rial articles; and this account of the Genius and Progre&s;s of Language, lays a foundation for many ob&s;ervations, both curious and u&s;e|ful. From what has been &s;aid, in this, and the preceding Lecture, it appears, that Lan|guage was, at fir&s;t, barren in words, but de|&s;criptive by the &s;ound of the&s;e words; and expre&s;&s;ive in the manner of uttering them, by the aid of &s;ignificant tones and ge&s;tures: Style was figurative and poetical: arrange|ment was fanciful and lively. It appears, that, in all the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive changes which Lan|guage has undergone, as the world advanced, the under&s;tanding has gained ground on the fancy and imagination. The Progre&s;s of Language, in this re&s;pect, re&s;embles the pro|gre&s;s of age in man. The imagination is mo&s;t vigorous and predominant in youth; with advancing years, the imagination cools, and the under&s;tanding ripens. Thus Lan|guage,
<PB N="147" REF="153">
proceeding from &s;terility to copiou&s;|ne&s;s, hath, at the &s;ame time, proceeded from vivacity to accuracy; from fire and enthu&s;i|a&s;m, to coolne&s;s and preci&s;ion. Tho&s;e cha|racters of early Language, de&s;criptive &s;ound, vehement tones and ge&s;tures, figurative &s;tyle, and inverted arrangement, all hang together, have a mutual influence on each other; and have all gradually given place, to arbitrary &s;ounds, calm pronunciation, &s;imple &s;tyle, plain arrangement. Language is become, in modern times, more correct, indeed, and ac|curate; but, however, le&s;s &s;triking and ani|mated: In its antient &s;tate, more favourable to poetry and oratory; in its pre&s;ent, to rea|&s;on and philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>HAVING fini&s;hed my account of the Pro|gre&s;s of Speech, I proceed to give an account of the Progre&s;s of Writing, which next de|mands our notice; though it will not require &s;o full a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion as the former &s;ubject.</P>
<P>NEXT to Speech, Writing is, beyond doubt, the mo&s;t u&s;eful art of which men are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed. It is plainly an improvement upon Speech, and therefore mu&s;t have been po&s;te|rior to it in order of time. At fir&s;t, men thought of nothing more than communicat|ing their thoughts to one another, when pre|&s;ent, by means of words, or &s;ounds, which they uttered. Afterwards, they devi&s;ed this further method, of mutual communication with one another, when ab&s;ent, by means of
<PB N="148" REF="154">
marks or characters pre&s;ented to the eye, which we call Writing.</P>
<P>WRITTEN characters are of two &s;orts. They are either &s;igns for things, or &s;igns for words. Of the former &s;ort, &s;igns of things, are the pictures, hieroglyphics, and &s;ymbols, employed by the antient nations; of the lat|ter &s;ort, &s;igns for words, are the alphabetical characters, now employed by all Europeans. The&s;e two kinds of Writing are generically, and e&s;&s;entially, di&s;tinct.</P>
<P>PICTURES were, undoubtedly, the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay towards Writing. Imitation is &s;o natu|ral to man, that, in all ages, and among all nations, &s;ome methods have obtained, of co|pying or tracing the likene&s;s of &s;en&s;ible ob|jects. Tho&s;e methods would &s;oon be em|ployed by men for giving &s;ome imperfect in|formation to others, at a di&s;tance, of what had happened; or, for pre&s;erving the memo|ry of facts which they &s;ought to record. Thus, to &s;ignify that one man had killed an|other, they drew the figure of one man &s;tretched upon the earth, and of another &s;tanding by him with a deadly weapon in his hand. We find, in fact, that, when Ame|rica was fir&s;t di&s;covered, this was the only &s;ort of Writing known in the kingdom of Mexico. By hi&s;torical pictures, the Mexi|cans are &s;aid to have tran&s;mitted the memory of the mo&s;t important tran&s;actions of their em|pire. The&s;e, however, mu&s;t have been ex|tremely
<PB N="149" REF="155">
imperfect records; and the nations who had no other, mu&s;t have been very gro&s;s and rude. Pictures could do no more than delineate external events. They could nei|ther exhibit the connections of them, nor de&s;cribe &s;uch qualities as were not vi&s;ible to the eye, nor convey any idea of the di&s;po&s;i|tions, or words, of men.</P>
<P>TO &s;upply, in &s;ome degree, this defect, there aro&s;e, in proce&s;s of time, the invention of what are called, Hieroglyphical Charac|ters; which may be con&s;idered as the &s;econd &s;tage of the Art of Writing. Hieroglyphics con&s;i&s;t in certain &s;ymbols, which are made to &s;tand for invi&s;ible objects, on account of an analogy or re&s;emblance which &s;uch &s;ymbols were &s;uppo&s;ed to bear to the objects. Thus, an eye, was the hieroglyphical &s;ymbol of knowledge; a circle, of eternity, which has neither beginning, nor end. Hieroglyphics, therefore, were a more refined and exten&s;ive &s;pecies of painting. Pictures delineated the re&s;emblance of external vi&s;ible objects. Hie|roglyphics painted invi&s;ible objects, by analo|gies taken from the external world.</P>
<P>AMONG the Mexicans, were found &s;ome traces of hieroglyphical characters, intermix|ed with their hi&s;torical pictures. But Egypt was the country where this &s;ort of Writing was mo&s;t &s;tudied, and brought into a regular art. In hieroglyphics, was conveyed all the boa&s;ted wi&s;dom of their prie&s;ts. According
<PB N="150" REF="156">
to the properties which they a&s;cribed to ani|mals, or the qualities with which they &s;up|po&s;ed natural objects to be endowed, they pitched upon them to be the emblems, or hieroglyphics, of moral objects; and em|ployed them in their Writing for that end. Thus, ingratitude was denominated by a viper; imprudence, by a fly; wi&s;dom, by an ant; victory, by a hawk; a dutiful child, by a &s;tork; a man univer&s;ally &s;hunned, by an eel, which they &s;uppo&s;ed to be found in company with no other fi&s;h. Sometimes they joined together two or more of the&s;e hieroglyphical characters; as, a &s;erpent with a hawk's head; to denote nature, with God pre&s;iding over it. But, as many of tho&s;e properties of objects which they a&s;&s;umed for the foundation of their hieroglyphics, were merely imaginary, and the allu&s;ions drawn from them were forced and ambiguous; as the conjunction of their characters rendered them &s;till more ob&s;cure, and mu&s;t have ex|pre&s;&s;ed very indi&s;tinctly the connections and relations of things; this &s;ort of Writing could be no other than aenigmatical, and confu&s;ed, in the highe&s;t degree; and mu&s;t have been a very imperfect vehicle of knowledge of any kind.</P>
<P>IT has been imagined, that hieroglyphics were an invention of the Egyptian prie&s;ts, for concealing their learning from common view; and that, upon this account, it was preferred by them to the alphabetical me|thod
<PB N="151" REF="157">
of Writing. But this is certainly a mi&s;take. Hieroglyphics were, undoubtedly, employed, at fir&s;t, from nece&s;&s;ity, not from choice or refinement; and would never have been thought of, if alphabetical characters had been known. The nature of the in|vention plainly &s;hows it to have been one of tho&s;e gro&s;s and rude e&s;&s;ays towards Writing, which were adopted in the early ages of the world; in order to extend &s;ome farther the fir&s;t method which they had employed of &s;imple pictures, or repre&s;entations of vi&s;ible objects. Indeed, in after-times, when alpha|betical Writing was introduced into Egypt, and the hieroglyphical was, of cour&s;e, fallen into di&s;u&s;e, it is known, that the prie&s;ts &s;till employed the hieroglyphical characters, as a &s;acred kind of Writing, now become peculiar to them&s;elves, and &s;erving to give an air of my&s;tery to their learning and religion. In this &s;tate, the Greeks found hieroglyphical Writing, when they began to have inter|cour&s;e with Egypt; and &s;ome of their writers mi&s;took this u&s;e, to which they found it ap|plied, for the cau&s;e that had given ri&s;e to the invention.</P>
<P>AS Writing advanced, from pictures of vi&s;ible objects, to hieroglyphics, or &s;ymbols of things invi&s;ible; from the&s;e latter, it ad|vanced, among &s;ome nations, to &s;imple ar|bitrary marks which &s;tood for objects, though without any re&s;emblance or analogy to the objects &s;ignified. Of this nature was the
<PB N="152" REF="158">
method of Writing practi&s;ed among the Pe|ruvians. They made u&s;e of &s;mall cords, of different colours; and by knots upon the&s;e, of various &s;izes, and differently ranged, they contrived &s;igns for giving information, and communicating their thoughts to one ano|ther.</P>
<P>OF this nature al&s;o, are the written cha|racters, which are u&s;ed to this day, through|out the great empire of China. The Chine&s;e have no alphabet of letters, or &s;imple &s;ounds, which compo&s;e their words. But every &s;in|gle character which they u&s;e in Writing, is &s;ignificant of an idea; it is a mark which &s;tands for &s;ome one thing, or object. By con&s;equence, the number of the&s;e characters mu&s;t be immen&s;e. It mu&s;t corre&s;pond to the whole number of objects, or ideas, which they have occa&s;ion to expre&s;s; that is, to the whole number of words which they employ in Speech: nay, it mu&s;t be greater than the number of words; one word, by varying the tone, with which it is &s;poken, may be made to &s;ignify &s;everal different things. They are &s;aid to have &s;eventy thou&s;and of tho&s;e writ|ten characters. To read and write them to perfection, is the &s;tudy of a whole life; which &s;ubjects learning, among them, to infinite di&s;advantage; and mu&s;t have greatly retard|ed the progre&s;s of all &s;cience.</P>
<P>CONCERNING the origin of the&s;e Chine&s;e characters, there have been different opini|ons,
<PB N="153" REF="159">
and much controver&s;y. According to the mo&s;t probable accounts, the Chine&s;e Wri|ting began, like the Egyptian, with pictures, and hieroglyphical figures. The&s;e figures being, in progre&s;s, abbreviated in their form, for the &s;ake of writing them ea&s;ily, and great|ly enlarged in their number, pa&s;&s;ed, at length, into tho&s;e marks or characters which they now u&s;e, and which have &s;pread them&s;elves through &s;everal nations of the Ea&s;t. For we are informed, that the Japane&s;e, the Tonqui|ne&s;e, and the Coroeans, who &s;peak different languages from one another, and from the inhabitants of China, u&s;e, however, the &s;ame written characters with them; and, by this means, corre&s;pond intelligibly with each other in Writing, though ignorant of the Language &s;poken in their &s;everal countries; a plain proof, that the Chine&s;e characters are, like hieroglyphics, independent of Language; are &s;igns of things, not of words.</P>
<P>WE have one in&s;tance of this &s;ort of Wri|ting in Europe. Our cyphers, as they are called, or arithmetical figures, 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. which we have derived from the Arabi|ans, are &s;ignificant marks, preci&s;ely of the &s;ame nature with the Chine&s;e characters. They have no dependence on words; but each figure repre&s;ents an object; repre&s;ents the number for which it &s;tands; and, ac|cordingly, on being pre&s;ented to the eye, is equally under&s;tood by all the nations who have agreed in the u&s;e of the&s;e cyphers; by
<PB N="154" REF="160">
Italians, Spaniards, French, and Engli&s;h, however different the Languages of tho&s;e nations are from one another, and whatever different names they give, in their re&s;pective Languages, to each numerical cypher.</P>
<P>AS far, then, as we have yet advanced, nothing has appeared which re&s;embles our letters, or which can be called Writing, in the &s;en&s;e we now give to that term. What we have hitherto &s;een, were all direct &s;igns for things, and made no u&s;e of the medium of &s;ound, or words; either &s;igns by repre|&s;entation, as the Mexican pictures; or &s;igns by analogy, as the Egyptian hieroglyphics; or &s;igns by in&s;titution, as the Peruvian knots, the Chine&s;e characters, and the A|rabian cyphers.</P>
<P>AT length, in different nations, men be|came &s;en&s;ible of the imperfection, the ambi|guity, and the tediou&s;ne&s;s of each of the&s;e methods of communication with one ano|ther. They began to con&s;ider, that by em|ploying &s;igns which &s;hould &s;tand not directly for things, but for the words which they u&s;ed in Speech for naming the&s;e things, a con&s;i|derable advantage would be gained. For they reflected farther, that though the num|ber of words in every Language be, indeed, very great, yet the number of articulate &s;ounds, which are u&s;ed in compo&s;ing the&s;e words, is comparatively &s;mall. The &s;ame &s;imple &s;ounds are continually recurring and
<PB N="155" REF="161">
repeated; and are combined together, in va|rious ways, for forming all the variety of words which we utter. They bethought them&s;elves, therefore, of inventing &s;igns, not for each word, by it&s;elf, but for each of tho&s;e &s;imple &s;ounds which we employ in forming our words; and, by joining together a few of tho&s;e &s;igns, they &s;aw that it would be practi|cable to expre&s;s, in Writing, the whole com|binations of &s;ounds which our words re|quire.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t &s;tep, in this new progre&s;s, was the invention of an alphabet of &s;yllables, which probably preceded the invention of an alphabet of letters, among &s;ome of the an|tient nations; and which is &s;aid to be retain|ed, to this day, in Aethiopia, and &s;ome coun|tries of India. By fixing upon a particular mark, or character, for every &s;yllable in the Language, the number of characters, nece&s;|&s;ary to be u&s;ed in Writing, was reduced within a much &s;maller compa&s;s than the number of words in the Language. Still, however, the number of characters was great; and mu&s;t have continued to render both reading and writing very laborious arts. Till, at la&s;t, &s;ome happy genius aro&s;e; and tracing the &s;ounds made by the human voice, to their mo&s;t &s;imple elements, reduced them to a very few vowels and con&s;onants; and, by affixing to each of the&s;e the &s;igns which we now call Letters, taught men how, by their combinations, to put into Writing all
<PB N="156" REF="162">
the different words, or combinations of &s;ound, which they employed in Speech. By being reduced to this &s;implicity, the art of Writing was brought to its highe&s;t &s;tate of perfection; and, in this &s;tate, we now enjoy it in all the countries of Europe.</P>
<P>TO whom we are indebted for this &s;ublime and refined di&s;covery, does not appear. Con|cealed by the darkne&s;s of remote antiquity, the great inventor is deprived of tho&s;e ho|nours which would &s;till be paid to his me|mory, by all the lovers of knowledge and learning. It appears from the books which Mo&s;es has written, that, among the Jews, and probably among the Egyptians, letters had been invented prior to his age. The uni|ver&s;al tradition among the antients is, that they were fir&s;t imported into Greece by Cad|mus the Phoenician; who, according to the common &s;y&s;tem of chronology, was contem|porary with Jo&s;hua; according to Sir I&s;aac Newton's &s;y&s;tem, contemporary with King David. As the Phoenicians are not known to have been the inventors of any art or &s;ci|ence, though, by means of their exten&s;ive commerce, they propagated the di&s;coveries made by other nations, the mo&s;t probable and natural account of the origin of alpha|betical characters is, that they took ri&s;e in Egypt, the fir&s;t civilized kingdom of which we have any authentic accounts, and the great &s;ource of arts and polity among the ancients. In that country, the favourite &s;tudy
<PB N="157" REF="163">
of hieroglyphical characters, had directed much attention to the art of Writing. Their hieroglyphics are known to have been inter|mixed with abbreviated &s;ymbols, and arbi|trary marks; whence, at la&s;t, they caught the idea of contriving marks, not for things merely, but for &s;ounds. Accordingly, Plato (in Phoedro) expre&s;sly attributes the invention of letters to Theuth, the Egyptian, who is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the Hermes, or Mer|cury, of the Greeks. Cadmus him&s;elf, though he pa&s;&s;ed from Phoenicia to Greece, yet is affirmed, by &s;everal of the antients, to have been originally of Thebes in Egypt. Mo&s;t probably, Mo&s;es carried with him the Egyp|tian letters into the land of Canaan; and there being adopted by the Phoenicians, who inhabited part of that country, they were tran&s;mitted into Greece.</P>
<P>THE alphabet which Cadmus brought into Greece was imperfect, and is &s;aid to have contained only &s;ixteen letters. The re&s;t were afterwards added, according as &s;igns for pro|per &s;ounds were found to be wanting. It is curious to ob&s;erve, that the letters which we u&s;e at this day, can be traced back to this very alphabet of Cadmus. The Roman al|phabet, which obtains with us, and with mo&s;t of the European nations, is plainly formed on the Greek, with a few variations. And all learned men ob&s;erve, that the Greek cha|racters, e&s;pecially according to the manner in which they are formed in the olde&s;t in&s;crip|tions,
<PB N="158" REF="164">
have a remarkable conformity with the Hebrew or Samaritan characters, which, it is agreed, are the &s;ame with the Phoenician, or the alphabet of Cadmus. Invert the Greek characters from left to right, according to the Phoenician and Hebrew manner of Writing, and they are nearly the &s;ame. Be&s;ides the conformity of figure, the names or denomi|nations of the letters, alpha, beta, gamma, &amp;c. and the order in which the letters are arranged, in all the &s;everal alphabets, Phoe|nician, Hebrew, Greek, and Roman, agree &s;o much, as amounts to a demon&s;tration, that they were all derived originally from the &s;ame &s;ource. An invention &s;o u&s;eful and &s;imple, was greedily received by mankind, and pro|pagated with &s;peed and facility through many different nations.</P>
<P>THE letters were, originally, written from the right hand towards the left; that is, in a contrary order to what we now practi&s;e. This manner of Writing obtained among the A&s;&s;y|rians, Phoenicians, Arabians, and Hebrews; and from &s;ome very old in&s;criptions, appears to have obtained al&s;o among the Greeks. Afterwards, the Greeks adopted a new me|thod, writing their lines alternately from the right to the left, and from the left to the right, which was called <HI>Bou&s;trophedon;</HI> or, writing after the manner in which oxen plow the ground. Of this, &s;everal &s;pecimens &s;till remain; particularly, the in&s;cription on the famous Sigaean monument; and down to the
<PB N="159" REF="165">
days of Solon, the legi&s;lator of Athens, this continued to be the common method of Wri|ting. At length, the motion from the left hand to the right being found more natural and commodious, the practice of Writing, in this direction, prevailed throughout all the countries of Europe.</P>
<P>WRITING was long a kind of engraving. Pillars, and tables of &s;tone, were fir&s;t em|ployed for this purpo&s;e, and afterwards, plates of the &s;ofter metals, &s;uch as lead. In pro|portion as Writing became more common, lighter and more portable &s;ub&s;tances were employed. The leaves, and the bark of cer|tain trees, were u&s;ed in &s;ome countries; and in others, tablets of wood, covered with a thin coat of &s;oft wax, on which the impre&s;|&s;ion was made with a &s;tylus of iron. In later times, the hides of animals, properly prepared and poli&s;hed into parchment, were the mo&s;t common materials. Our pre&s;ent method of writing on paper, is an invention of no great|er antiquity than the fourteenth century.</P>
<P>THUS I have given &s;ome account of the Progre&s;s of the&s;e two great arts, Speech and Writing; by which men's thoughts are com|municated, and the foundation laid for all knowledge and improvement. Let us con|clude the &s;ubject, with comparing, in a few words, &s;poken Language, and written Lan|guage; or words uttered in our hearing, with words repre&s;ented to the eye; where we &s;hall
<PB N="160" REF="166">
find &s;everal advantages and di&s;advantages to be balanced on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>THE advantages of Writing above Speech are, that Writing is both a more exten&s;ive, and a more permanent method of communi|cation. More exten&s;ive; as it is not con|fined within the narrow circle of tho&s;e who hear our words, but, by means of written characters, we can &s;end our thoughts abroad, and propagate them through the world; we can lift our voice, &s;o as to &s;peak to the mo&s;t di&s;tant regions of the earth. More perma|nent al&s;o; as it prolongs this voice to the mo&s;t di&s;tant ages; it gives us the means of record|ing our &s;entiments to futurity, and of perpe|tuating the in&s;tructive memory of pa&s;t tran|&s;actions. It likewi&s;e affords this advantage to &s;uch as read, above &s;uch as hear, that, having the written characters before their eyes, they can arre&s;t the &s;en&s;e of the writer. They can pau&s;e, and revolve, and compare, at their lei&s;ure, one pa&s;&s;age with another; whereas, the voice is fugitive and pa&s;&s;ing; you mu&s;t catch the words the moment they are uttered, or you lo&s;e them for ever.</P>
<P>BUT, although the&s;e be &s;o great advan|tages of written Language, that Speech, with|out Writing, would have been very inade|quate for the in&s;truction of mankind; yet we mu&s;t not forget to ob&s;erve, that &s;poken Language has a great &s;uperiority over written Language, in point of energy or force. The
<PB N="161" REF="167">
voice of the living Speaker, makes an im|pre&s;&s;ion on the mind, much &s;tronger than can be made by the peru&s;al of any Writing. The tones of voice, the looks and ge&s;ture, which accompany di&s;cour&s;e, and which no Writing can convey, render di&s;cour&s;e, when it is well managed, infinitely more clear, and more expre&s;&s;ive, than the mo&s;t accurate Writing. For tones, looks, and ge&s;tures, are natural interpreters of the &s;entiments of the mind. They remove ambiguities; they enforce im|pre&s;&s;ions; they operate on us by means of &s;ympathy, which is one of the mo&s;t power|ful in&s;truments of per&s;ua&s;ion. Our &s;ympa|thy is always awakened more, by hearing the Speaker, than by reading his works in our clo&s;et. Hence, though Writing may an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of mere in&s;truction, yet all the great and high efforts of eloquence mu&s;t be made, by means of &s;poken, not of written, Language.</P>

<HEAD>LECTURE VIII. STRUCTURE OF LANGUAGE.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER having given an account of the Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of Language, I pro|ceed to treat of its Structure, or of General Grammar. The Structure of Language is extremely artificial; and there are few &s;ci|ences, in which a deeper, or more refined lo|gic, is employed, than in Grammar. It is apt to be &s;lighted by &s;uperficial thinkers, as be|longing to tho&s;e rudiments of knowledge, which were inculcated upon us in our earlie&s;t youth. But what was then inculcated before we could comprehend its principles, would abundantly repay our &s;tudy in maturer years; and to the ignorance of it, mu&s;t be attribut|ed many of tho&s;e fundamental defects which appear in writing.</P>
<P>FEW authors have written with philo&s;o|phical accuracy on the principles of General Grammar; and, what is more to be regret|ted,
<PB N="163" REF="169">
fewer &s;till have thought of applying tho&s;e principles to the Engli&s;h Language. While the French Tongue has long been an object of attention to many able and ingenious wri|ters of that nation, who have con&s;idered its con&s;truction, and determined its propriety with great accuracy, the Genius and Gram|mar of the Engli&s;h, to the reproach of the country, have not been &s;tudied with equal care, or a&s;certained with the &s;ame preci&s;ion. Attempts have been made, indeed, of late, towards &s;upplying this defect; and &s;ome able writers have entered on the &s;ubject; but much remains yet to be done.</P>
<P>I DO not propo&s;e to give any &s;y&s;tem, either of Grammar in general, or of Engli&s;h Gram|mar in particular. A minute di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the niceties of Language would carry us too much off from other objects, which demand our attention in this cour&s;e of Lectures. But I propo&s;e to give a general view of the chief principles relating to this &s;ubject, in ob&s;erva|tions on the &s;everal parts of which Speech or Language is compo&s;ed; remarking, as I go along, the peculiarities of our own Tongue. After which, I &s;hall make &s;ome more particu|lar remarks on the Genius of the Engli&s;h Language.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t thing to be con&s;idered, is, the divi&s;ion of the &s;everal parts of Speech. The e&s;&s;ential parts of Speech are the &s;ame in all Languages. There mu&s;t always be &s;ome
<PB N="164" REF="170">
words which denote the names of objects, or mark the &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e; other words, which denote the qualities of tho&s;e objects, and expre&s;s what we affirm concern|ing them; and other words, which point out their connections and relations. Hence, &s;ub|&s;tantives, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, prepo|&s;itions, and conjunctions, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be found in all Languages. The mo&s;t &s;imple and comprehen&s;ive divi&s;ion of the parts of Speech is, into &s;ub&s;tantives, attributives, and connectives<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quinctilian informs us, that this was the mo&s;t antient di|vi&s;ion. <Q REND="inline">"Tum videbit quot &amp; quae &s;unt partes orationis. Quanquam de numero parum convenit. Veteres e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">im, quorum fuerant Ari&s;toteles atque Theodictes, verba modo, &amp; nomina, &amp; convinctiones tradiderunt.

I. cap. iv.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. Sub&s;tantives, are all the words which expre&s;s the names of objects, or the &s;ubjects of di&s;cour&s;e; attributives, are all the words which expre&s;s any attribute, property, or action of the former; connectives, are what expre&s;s the connections, relations, and dependencies, which take place among them. The common grammatical divi&s;ion of Speech into eight parts; nouns, pronouns, verbs, par|ticiples, adverbs, prepo&s;itions, interjections, and conjunctions, is not very logical, as might be ea&s;ily &s;hewn; as it comprehends,
<PB N="165" REF="171">
under the general term of nouns, both &s;ub|&s;tantives and adjectives, which are parts of Speech generically and e&s;&s;entially di&s;tinct; while it makes a &s;eparate part of &s;peech of participles, which are no other than verbal adjectives. However, as the&s;e are the terms to which our ears have been mo&s;t familiari&s;|ed, and, as an exact logical divi&s;ion is of no great con&s;equence to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, it will be better to make u&s;e of the&s;e known terms than of any other.</P>
<P>WE are naturally led to begin with the con&s;ideration of &s;ub&s;tantive nouns, which are the foundation of all Grammar, and may be con&s;idered as the mo&s;t antient part of Speech. For, a&s;&s;uredly, as &s;oon as men had got beyond &s;imple interjections, or exclama|tions of pa&s;&s;ion, and began to communicate them&s;elves by di&s;cour&s;e, they would be under a nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;&s;igning names to the objects they &s;aw around them; which, in Grammati|cal Language, is called, the Invention of &s;ub&s;tantive nouns<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I do not mean to a&s;&s;ert, that, among all nations, the fir&s;t invented words were &s;imple and regular &s;ub&s;tantive nouns. Nothing is more difficult and uncertain, than to a&s;certain the preci&s;e &s;teps by which men proceeded in the formation of Lan|guage. Names for objects mu&s;t, doubtle&s;s, have ari&s;en in the mo&s;t early &s;tages of Speech. But, it is probable, as the learn|ed author of the Treati&s;e, <HI>On the Origin and Progre&s;s of Language,</HI> has &s;hown (vol. i. p 371. 395.), that, among &s;e|veral &s;avage tribes, &s;ome of the fir&s;t articulate &s;ounds that were formed, denoted a whole &s;entence rather than the name of a particular object; conveying &s;ome information, or expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome de&s;ires or fears, &s;uited to the circum&s;tances in which that tribe was placed, or relating to the bu&s;ine&s;s they had mo&s;t fre|quent occa&s;ion to carry on; as, the lion is coming, the river is &s;welling, &amp;c. Many of their fir&s;t words, it is likewi&s;e probable, were not &s;imple &s;ub&s;tantive nouns, but &s;ub&s;tantives, accompanied with &s;ome of tho&s;e attributes, in conjunction with which they were mo&s;t frequently accu&s;tomed to behold them; as, the great bear, the little hut, the wound made by the hatchet, &amp;c. Of all which, the Author produces in&s;tances from &s;everal of the American Languages; and it is, undoubtedly, &s;uitable to the natural cour&s;e of the operations of the human mind, thus to begin with particulars the mo&s;t obvious to &s;en&s;e, and to proceed, from the&s;e, to more general expre&s;&s;ions. He likewi&s;e ob&s;erves, that the words of tho&s;e primitive tongues are far from being, as we might &s;uppo&s;e them, rude and &s;hort, and crowded with con&s;onants; but, on the contrary, are, for the mo&s;t part, long words, and full of vowels. This is the con&s;equence of their being formed upon the natural &s;ounds which the voice utters with mo&s;t ea&s;e, a little varied and di&s;tingui&s;hed by articulation; and he &s;hows this to hold, in fact, among mo&s;t of the barbarous Languages which are known.</NOTE>. And here, at our fir&s;t
<PB N="166" REF="172">
&s;etting out, &s;omewhat curious occurs. The individual objects which &s;urround us, are infinite in number. A &s;avage, wherever he looked, beheld fore&s;ts and trees. To give &s;eparate names to every one of the&s;e trees, would have been an endle&s;s and impractica|ble undertaking. His fir&s;t object was, to give a name to that particular tree, who&s;e fruit relieved his hunger, or who&s;e &s;hade protected him from the &s;un. But ob&s;erving, that though other trees were di&s;tingui&s;hed from this by peculiar qualities of &s;ize or ap|pearance, yet, that they al&s;o agreed and re|&s;embled one another, in certain common qualities, &s;uch as &s;pringing from a root, and bearing branches and leaves, he formed, in his mind, &s;ome general idea of tho&s;e common qualities, and ranging all that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them under one cla&s;s of objects, he called that whole cla&s;s, <HI>a tree.</HI> Longer experience
<PB N="167" REF="173">
taught him to &s;ubdivide this genus into the &s;everal &s;pecies of oak, pine, a&s;h, and the re&s;t, according as his ob&s;ervation extended to the &s;everal qualities in which the&s;e trees agreed or differed.</P>
<P>BUT, &s;till, he made u&s;e only of general terms in Speech. For the oak, the pine, and the a&s;h, were names of whole cla&s;&s;es of ob|jects; each of which included an immen&s;e number of undi&s;tingui&s;hed individuals. Here then, it appears, that though the formation of ab&s;tract, or general conceptions, is &s;up|po&s;ed to be a difficult operation of the mind; &s;uch conceptions mu&s;t have entered into the very fir&s;t formation of Language. For, if we except only the proper names of per&s;ons, &s;uch as Cae&s;ar, John, Peter, all the other &s;ub|&s;tantive nouns which we employ in di&s;cour&s;e, are the names, not of individual objects, but of very exten&s;ive genera, or &s;pecies of ob|jects; as, man, lion, hou&s;e, river, &amp;c. We are not, however, to imagine, that this in|vention of general, or ab&s;tract terms, re|quires any great exertion of metaphy&s;ical capacity: For, by whatever &s;teps the mind proceeds in it, it is certain, that, when men have once ob&s;erved re&s;emblances among ob|jects, they are naturally inclined to call all tho&s;e which re&s;emble one another, by one common name; and of cour&s;e, to cla&s;s them under one &s;pecies. We may daily ob&s;erve this practi&s;ed by children, in their fir&s;t at|tempts towards acquiring Language.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="174">
BUT now, after Language had proceeded as far as I have de&s;cribed, the notification which it made of objects was &s;till very im|perfect: For, when one mentioned to ano|ther, in di&s;cour&s;e, any &s;ub&s;tantive noun; &s;uch as, man, lion, or tree, how was it to be known which man, which lion, or which tree he meant, among the many comprehend|ed under one name? Here occurs a very curious, and a very u&s;eful contrivance for &s;pecifying the individual object intended, by means of that part of Speech called, the Ar|ticle.</P>
<P>THE force of the Article con&s;i&s;ts, in point|ing, or &s;ingling out from the common ma&s;s, the individual of which we mean to &s;peak. In Engli&s;h, we have two Articles, <HI>a</HI> and <HI>the; a</HI> is more general and unlimited; <HI>the</HI> more definite and &s;pecial. <HI>A</HI> is much the &s;ame with <HI>one,</HI> and marks only any one individual of a &s;pecies; that individual being either un|known, or left undertermined; as, a lion, a king. <HI>The,</HI> which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es more properly the force of the Article, a&s;certains &s;ome known or determined individual of the &s;pe|cies; as, the lion, the king.</P>
<P>ARTICLES are words of great u&s;e in Speech. In &s;ome Languages, however, they are not found. The Greeks have but one Article, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> which an&s;wers to our definite, or pro|per Article, <HI>the.</HI> They have no word which an&s;wers to our Article <HI>a;</HI> but they &s;upply its
<PB N="169" REF="175">
place by the ab&s;ence of their Article: Thus, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ignifies, <HI>a</HI> king; <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, <HI>the</HI> king The Latins have no Article. In the room of it, they employ pronouns, as, hic, ille, i&s;te, for pointing out the objects which they want to di&s;tingui&s;h. <Q REND="inline">"No&s;ter &s;ermo,"</Q> &s;ays Quinc|tilian, <Q REND="inline">"articulos non de&s;iderat, ideoque in alias partes orationis &s;parguntur."</Q> This, however, appears to me a defect in the Latin tongue; as Articles contribute much to the clearne&s;s and preci&s;ion of Language.</P>
<P>IN order to illu&s;trate this, remark, what difference there is in the meaning of the fol|lowing expre&s;&s;ions in Engli&s;h, depending wholly on the different employment of the Articles: <Q REND="inline">"The &s;on of a king.&mdash;The &s;on of the king&mdash;A &s;on of the king's"</Q> Each of the&s;e three phra&s;es has an entirely different meaning, which I need not explain, becau&s;e any one who under&s;tands the Language, con|ceives it clearly at fir&s;t hearing, through the different application of the Articles, <HI>a</HI> and <HI>the.</HI> Whereas, in Latin, <Q REND="inline">"Filius regis,"</Q> is wholly undetermined; and to explain, in which of the&s;e three &s;en&s;es it is to be under|&s;tood, for it may bear any of them, a cir|cumlocution of &s;everal words mu&s;t be u&s;ed. In the &s;ame manner, <Q REND="inline">"Are you <HI>a</HI> king?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Are you <HI>the</HI> king?"</Q> are que&s;tions of quite &s;eparate import; which, however, are con|founded together in the Latin phra&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"e&s;ne tu rex?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Thou art <HI>a</HI> man,"</Q> is a very general and harmle&s;s po&s;ition; but, <Q REND="inline">"thou
<PB N="170" REF="176">
art <HI>the</HI> man,"</Q> is an a&s;&s;ertion, capable, we know, of &s;triking terror and remor&s;e into the heart. The&s;e ob&s;ervations illu&s;trate the force and importance of Articles: And, at the &s;ame time, I gladly lay hold of any opportu|nity of &s;hewing the advantages of our own Language.</P>
<P>BESIDES this quality of being particulari&s;ed by the Articie, three affections belong to &s;ub|&s;tantive nouns, number, gender, and ca&s;e, which require our con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>NUMBER di&s;tingui&s;hes them as one, or many, of the &s;ame kind, called the Singular and Plural; a di&s;tinction found in all Lan|guages, and which mu&s;t, indeed, have been co&euml;val with the very infancy of Language; as there were few things which men had more frequent occa&s;ion to expre&s;s, than the differ|ence between one and many. For the grea|ter facility of expre&s;&s;ing it, it has, in all Lan|guages, been marked by &s;ome variation made upon the &s;ub&s;tantive noun; as we &s;ee, in Engli&s;h, our plural is commonly formed by the addition of the letter S. In the Hebrew, Greek, and &s;ome other antient Languages, we find, not only a plural, but a dual num|ber; the ri&s;e of which may very naturally be accounted for, from &s;eparate terms of num|bering not being yet invented, and one, two, and many, being all, or, at lea&s;t, the chief numeral di&s;tinctions which men, at fir&s;t, had any occa&s;ion to take notice of.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="177">
GENDER, is an affection of &s;ub&s;tantive nouns, which will lead us into more di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion than number. Gender, being founded on the di&s;tinction of the two &s;exes, it is plain, that, in a proper &s;en&s;e, it can only find place in the names of living creatures, which admit the di&s;tinction of male and fe|male; and, therefore, can be ranged under the ma&s;culine or feminine genders. All other &s;ub&s;tantive nouns ought to belong, to what grammarians call, the Neuter Gender, which is meant to imply the negation of either &s;ex. But, with re&s;pect to this di&s;tribution, &s;ome|what &s;ingular hath obtained in the &s;tructure of Language. For, in corre&s;pondence to that di&s;tinction of male and female &s;ex, which runs through all the cla&s;&s;es of animals, men have, in mo&s;t Languages, ranked a great number of inaminate objects al&s;o, under the like di&s;tinctions of ma&s;culine and feminine. Thus we find it, both in the Greek and La|tin Tongues. <HI>Gladius,</HI> a &s;word, for in&s;tance, is ma&s;culine; <HI>&s;agitta,</HI> an arrow, is feminine; and this a&s;&s;ignation of &s;ex to inanimate ob|jects, this di&s;tinction of them into ma&s;culine and feminine, appears often to be entirely capricious; derived from no other principle than the ca&s;ual &s;tructure of the Language, which refers to a certain gender, words of a certain termination. In the Greek and La|tin, however, all inanimate objects are not di&s;tributed into ma&s;culine and feminine; but many of them are al&s;o cla&s;&s;ed, where all of
<PB N="172" REF="178">
them ought to have been, under the neuter gender; as, <HI>templum,</HI> a church; <HI>&s;edile,</HI> a &s;eat.</P>
<P>BUT the genius of the French and Italian Tongues differs, in this re&s;pect, from the Greek and Latin. In the French and Italian, from whatever cau&s;e it has happened, &s;o it is, that the neuter gender is wholly unknown, and that all their names of inanimate objects are put upon the &s;ame footing with living creatures; and di&s;tributed, without excepti|on, into ma&s;culine and feminine. The French have two articles, the ma&s;culine <HI>le,</HI> and the feminine <HI>la;</HI> and one or other of the&s;e is prefixed to all &s;ub&s;tantive nouns in the Lan|guage, to denote their gender. The Italians make the &s;ame univer&s;al u&s;e of their articles <HI>il</HI> and <HI>lo,</HI> for the ma&s;culine; and <HI>la,</HI> for the feminine.</P>
<P>IN the Engli&s;h Language, it is remarkable that there obtains a peculiarity quite oppo|&s;ite. In the French and Italian, there is no neuter gender. In the Engli&s;h, when we u&s;e common di&s;cour&s;e, all &s;ub&s;tantive nouns, that are not names of living creatures, are neuter, without exception. <HI>He, &s;he,</HI> and <HI>it,</HI> are the marks of the three genders; and we always u&s;e <HI>it,</HI> in &s;peaking of any object where there is no &s;ex, or where the &s;ex is not known. The Engli&s;h is, perhaps, the only Language in the known world (except the Chine&s;e, which is &s;aid to agree with it in this parti|cular), where the di&s;tinction of gender is pro|perly
<PB N="173" REF="179">
and philo&s;ophically applied in the u&s;e of words, and confined, as it ought to be, to mark the real di&s;tinctions of male and fe|male.</P>
<P>HENCE ari&s;es a very great and &s;ignal ad|vantage of the Engli&s;h Tongue, which it is of con&s;equence to remark<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following ob&s;ervations on the metaphorical u&s;e of genders, in the Engli&s;h Language, are taken from Mr. Harris's Hermes.</NOTE>. Though in common di&s;cour&s;e, as I have already ob&s;erv|ed, we employ only the proper and literal di&s;tinction of &s;exes; yet the genius of the Language permits us, whenever it will add beauty to our di&s;cour&s;e, to make the names of inanimate objects ma&s;culine or feminine in a metaphorical &s;en&s;e; and when we do &s;o, we are under&s;tood to quit the literal &s;tyle, and to u&s;e one of the figures of di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>FOR in&s;tance; if I am &s;peaking of virtue, in the cour&s;e of ordinary conver&s;ation, or of &s;trict rea&s;oning, I refer the word to no &s;ex or gender; I &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Virtue is its own reward;"</Q> or, <Q REND="inline">"it is the law of our nature."</Q> But if I chu&s;e to ri&s;e into a higher tone; if I &s;eek to embelli&s;h and animate my di&s;cour&s;e, I give a &s;ex to virtue; I &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"She de&s;cends from Heaven;"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"&s;he alone confers true honour upon man;"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"her gifts are the only dura|ble rewards."</Q> By this means, we have it in our power to vary our &s;tyle at plea&s;ure.
<PB N="174" REF="180">
By making a very &s;light alteration, we can per&s;onify any object that we chu&s;e to intro|duce with dignity; and by this change of manner, we give warning, that we are pa&s;|&s;ing from the &s;trict and logical, to the orna|mented and rhetorical &s;tyle.</P>
<P>THIS is an advantage which, not only every poet, but every good writer and &s;peak|er in pro&s;e, is, on many occa&s;ions, glad to lay hold of, and improve: and it is an advantage peculiar to our Tongue; no other Language po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it. For, in other Languages, every word has one fixed gender, ma&s;culine, femi|mine, or neuter, which can, upon no occa|&s;ion, be changed; <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> for in&s;tance, in Greek, <HI>virtus</HI> in Latin, and <HI>la vertu</HI> in French, are uniformly feminine. <HI>She,</HI> mu&s;t always be the pronoun an&s;wering to the word, whether you be writing in poetry or pro&s;e, whether you be u&s;ing the &s;tyle of rea&s;oning, or that of declamation: whereas, in Engli&s;h, we can either expre&s;s our&s;elves with the philo&s;ophical accuracy of giving no gender to things inani|mate; or by giving them gender, and trans|forming them into per&s;ons, we adapt them to the &s;tyle of poetry, and, when it is proper, we enliven pro&s;e.</P>
<P>IT de&s;erves to be further remarked on this &s;ubject, that, when we employ that liberty which our Language allows, of a&s;cribing &s;ex to any inanimate object, we have not, how|ever, the liberty of making it of what gender
<PB N="175" REF="181">
we plea&s;e, ma&s;culine or feminine; but are, in general, &s;ubjected to &s;ome rule of gender which the currency of Language has fixed to that object. The foundation of that rule is imagined, by Mr. Harris, in his "Philo&s;o|phical Enquiry into the Principles of Gram|mar," to be laid in a certain di&s;tant re&s;em|blance, or analogy, to the natural di&s;tinction of the two &s;exes.</P>
<P>THUS, according to him, we commonly give the ma&s;culine gender to tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tan|tive nouns u&s;ed figuratively, which are con|&s;picuous for the attributes of imparting, or communicating; which are by nature &s;trong and efficacious, either to good or evil; or which have a claim to &s;ome eminence, whe|ther laudable or not. Tho&s;e again, he ima|gines, to be generally made feminine, which are con&s;picuous for the attributes of contain|ing, and of bringing forth; which have more of the pa&s;&s;ive in their nature, than the ac|tive; which are peculiarly beautiful, or amia|ble; or which have re&s;pect to &s;uch exce&s;&s;es as are rather feminine than ma&s;culine. Upon the&s;e principles he takes notice, that the &s;un is always put in the ma&s;culine gender with us; the moon in the feminine, as being the receptacle of the &s;un's light. The earth is, univer&s;ally, feminine. A &s;hip, a country, a city, are likewi&s;e made feminine, as receiv|ers, or containers. God, in all Languages, is ma&s;culine. Time, we make ma&s;culine, on account of its mighty efficacy; virtue, femi|nine,
<PB N="176" REF="182">
from its beauty, and its being the ob|ject of love. Fortune is always feminine. Mr. Harris imagines, that the rea&s;ons which determine the gender of &s;uch capital words as the&s;e, hold in mo&s;t other Languages, as well as the Engli&s;h. This, however, appears doubtful. A variety of circum&s;tances, which &s;eem ca&s;ual to us, becau&s;e we cannot reduce them to principles, mu&s;t, unque&s;tionably, have influenced the original formation of Languages; and in no article whatever does Language appear to have been more capri|cious, and to have proceeded le&s;s according to fixed rule, than in the impo&s;ition of gen|der upon things inanimate; e&s;pecially among &s;uch nations as have applied the di&s;tinction of ma&s;culine and feminine to all &s;ub&s;tantive nouns.</P>
<P>HAVING di&s;cu&s;&s;ed gender, I proceed, next, to another remarkable peculiarity of &s;ub&s;tan|tive nouns, which, in the &s;tyle of grammar, is called, their declen&s;ion by ca&s;es. Let us, fir&s;t, con&s;ider what ca&s;es &s;ignify. In order to under&s;tand this, it is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that, after men had given names to external objects, had particulari&s;ed them by means of the article, and di&s;tingui&s;hed them by num|ber and gender, &s;till their Language remain|ed extremely imperfect, till they had devi&s;ed &s;ome method of expre&s;&s;ing the relations which tho&s;e objects bore, one towards another. They would find it of little u&s;e to have a name for man, lion, tree, river, without be|ing
<PB N="177" REF="183">
able, at the &s;ame time, to &s;ignify how the&s;e &s;tood with re&s;pect to each other; whe|ther, as approaching to, receding from, join|ed with, and the like. Indeed, the relations which objects bear to one another, are im|men&s;ely numerous; and therefore, to devi&s;e names for them all, mu&s;t have been among the la&s;t and mo&s;t difficult refinements of Language. But, in its mo&s;t early periods, it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to expre&s;s, in &s;ome way or other, &s;uch relations as were mo&s;t important, and as occurred mo&s;t frequently in common Speech. Hence the genitive, da|tive, and ablative ca&s;es of nouns, which ex|pre&s;s the noun it&s;elf, together with tho&s;e re|lations, <HI>of, to, from, with,</HI> and <HI>by;</HI> the rela|tions which, of all others, we have the mo&s;t frequent occa&s;ion to mention. The proper idea then of ca&s;es in declen&s;ion, is no other than an expre&s;&s;ion of the &s;tate, or relation, which one object bears to another, denoted by &s;ome variation made upon the name of that object; mo&s;t commonly in the final let|ters, and by &s;ome Languages, in the initial.</P>
<P>ALL Languages, however, do not agree in this mode of expre&s;&s;ion. The Greek, La|tin, and &s;everal other Languages, u&s;e declen|&s;ion. The Engli&s;h, French, and Italian, do not; or, at mo&s;t, u&s;e it very imperfectly. In place of the variations of ca&s;es, the&s;e modern Tongues expre&s;s the relations of objects, by means of the words called Prepo&s;itions, which are the names of tho&s;e relations, prefixed to
<PB N="178" REF="184">
the name of the object. Engli&s;h nouns have no ca&s;e whatever, except a &s;ort of genitive, commonly formed by the addition of the let|ter s to the noun; as when we &s;ay <Q REND="inline">"Dryden's Poems,"</Q> meaning the Poems of Dryden. Our per&s;onal pronouns have al&s;o a ca&s;e, which an&s;wers to the accu&s;ative of the Latin, <HI>I, me,&mdash;he, him,&mdash;who, whom.</HI> There is nothing, then, or at lea&s;t very little, in the Grammar of our Language, which corre&s;ponds to de|clen&s;ion in the antient Languages.</P>
<P>TWO que&s;tions, re&s;pecting this &s;ubject, may be put. Fir&s;t, Which of the&s;e methods of expre&s;&s;ing relations, whether that by de|clen&s;ion, or that by prepo&s;itions, was the mo&s;t antient u&s;age in Language? And next, Which of them has the be&s;t effect? Both methods, it is plain, are the &s;ame as to the &s;en&s;e, and differ only in form. For the &s;ig|nificancy of the Roman Language would not have been altered, though the nouns, like ours, had been without ca&s;es, provided they had employed prepo&s;itions; and though, to expre&s;s a di&s;ciple of Plato, they had &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Di&s;cipulus de Plato,"</Q> like the modern Ita|lians, in place of <Q REND="inline">"Di&s;cipulus Platonis."</Q></P>
<P>NOW, with re&s;pect to the antiquity of ca&s;es, although they may, on fir&s;t view, &s;eem to con&s;titute a more artificial method than the other, of denoting relations, yet there are &s;trong rea&s;ons for thinking that this was the earlie&s;t method practi&s;ed by men. We find,
<PB N="179" REF="185">
in fact, that declen&s;ions and ca&s;es are u&s;ed in mo&s;t of what are called the Mother Tongues, or Original Languages, as well as in the Greek and Latin. And a very natural and &s;atis|fying account can be given why this u&s;age &s;hould have early obtained. Relations are the mo&s;t ab&s;tract and metaphy&s;ical ideas of any which men have occa&s;ion to form, when they are con&s;idered by them&s;elves, and &s;e|parated from the related object. It would puzzle any man, as has been well ob&s;erved by an Author on this &s;ubject, to give a di&s;|tinct account of what is meant by &s;uch a word as <HI>of,</HI> or <HI>from,</HI> when it &s;tands by it&s;elf, and to explain all that may be included under it. The fir&s;t rude inventors of Language, therefore, would be long of arriving at &s;uch general terms. In place of con&s;idering any relation in the ab&s;tract, and devi&s;ing a name for it, they would much more ea&s;ily conceive it in conjunction with a particular object; and they would expre&s;s their conceptions of it, by varying the name of that object through all the different ca&s;es; <HI>hominis,</HI> of a man; <HI>ho|mini,</HI> to a man; <HI>homine,</HI> with a man, &amp;c.</P>
<P>BUT, though this method of declen&s;ion was, probably, the only method which men employed, at fir&s;t, for denoting relations, yet, in progre&s;s of time, many other relations be|ing ob&s;erved, be&s;ides tho&s;e which are &s;igni|fied by the ca&s;es of nouns, and men al&s;o be|coming more capable of general and meta|phy&s;ical ideas, &s;eparate names were gradually
<PB N="180" REF="186">
invented for all the relations which occurred, forming that part of Speech which we now call Prepo&s;itions. Prepo&s;itions being once introduced, they were found to be capable of &s;upplying the place of ca&s;es, by being prefix|ed to the nominative of the noun. Hence, it came to pa&s;s, that, as nations were inter|mixed by migrations and conque&s;ts, and were obliged to learn, and adopt the Languages of one another, prepo&s;itions &s;upplanted the u&s;e of ca&s;es and declen&s;ions. When the Italian Tongue, for in&s;tance, &s;prung out of the Ro|man, it was found more ea&s;y and &s;imple, by the Gothic nations, to accommodate a few prepo&s;itions to the nominative of every noun, and to &s;ay, <HI>di Roma, al Roma, di Carthago, al Carthago,</HI> than to remember all the variety of terminations, <HI>Romae, Romam, Carthaginis, Carthaginem,</HI> which the u&s;e of declen&s;ions required in the antient nouns. By this pro|gre&s;s we can give a natural account how nouns, in our modern Tongues, come to be &s;o void of declen&s;ion: A progre&s;s which is fully illu&s;trated in Dr. Adam Smith's ingeni|ous Di&s;&s;ertation on the Formation of Lan|guages.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the other que&s;tion on this &s;ubject, Which of the&s;e two methods is of the greate&s;t utility and beauty? we &s;hall find advantages and di&s;advantages to be ba|lanced on both &s;ides. There is no doubt that, by aboli&s;hing ca&s;es, we have rendered the &s;tructure of modern Languages more &s;imple.
<PB N="181" REF="187">
We have di&s;embarra&s;&s;ed it of all the intricacy which aro&s;e from the different forms of de|clen&s;ion, of which the Romans had no fewer than five; and from all the irregularities in the&s;e &s;everal declen&s;ions. We have thereby rendered our Languages more ea&s;y to be ac|quired, and le&s;s &s;ubject to the perplexity of rules. But, though the &s;implicity and ea&s;e of Language be great and e&s;timable advan|tages, yet there are al&s;o &s;uch di&s;advantages attending the modern method, as leave the balance, on the whole, doubtful, or rather incline it to the &s;ide of antiquity.</P>
<P>FOR, in the fir&s;t place, by our con&s;tant u&s;e of prepo&s;itions for expre&s;&s;ing the relations of things, we have filled Language with a mul|titude of tho&s;e little words, which are eter|nally occurring in every &s;entence, and may be thought thereby to have encumbered Speech, by an addition of terms; and by rendering it more prolix, to have enervated its force. In the &s;econd place, we have cer|tainly rendered the &s;ound of Languge le&s;s agreeable to the ear, by depriving it of that variety and &s;weetne&s;s, which aro&s;e from the length of words, and the change of termina|tions, occa&s;ioned by the ca&s;es in the Greek and Latin. But, in the third place, the mo&s;t material di&s;advantage is, that, by this aboli|tion of ca&s;es, and by a &s;imilar alteration, of which I am to &s;peak in the next Lecture, in he conjugation of verbs, we have deprived
<PB N="182" REF="188">
our&s;elves of that liberty of tran&s;po&s;ition in the arrangement of words, which the Anti|ent Languages enjoyed.</P>
<P>IN the Antient Tongues, as I formerly ob|&s;erved, the different terminations, produced by declen&s;ion and conjugation, pointed out the reference of the &s;everal words of a &s;entence to one another, without the aid of juxtapo&s;iti|on; &s;uffered them to be placed, without am|biguity, in whatever order was mo&s;t &s;uited to give empha&s;is to the meaning, or harmo|ny to the &s;ound. But now, having none of tho&s;e marks of relation incorporated with the words them&s;elves, we have no other way left us, of &s;howing what words in a &s;entence are mo&s;t clo&s;ely connected in meaning, than that of placing them clo&s;e by one another in thepe|riod. The meaning of the &s;entence is brought out in &s;eparate members and portions; it is broken down and divided. Whereas the &s;tructure of the Greek and Roman &s;entences, by the government of their nouns and verbs, pre&s;ented the meaning &s;o interwoven and compounded in all its parts, as to make us perceive it in one united view. The clo&s;ing words of the period a&s;certained the relation of each member to another; and all that ought to be connected in our idea, appeared connected in the expre&s;&s;ion. Hence, more brevity, more vivacity, more force. That luggage of particles (as an ingenious Author happily expre&s;&s;es it), which we are obliged
<PB N="183" REF="189">
always to carry along with us, both clogs &s;tyle, and enfeebles &s;entiment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"The various terminations of the &s;ame word, whether verb or noun, are always conceived to be more intimately connected with the term which they &s;erve to lengthen, than the additional, detached, and in them&s;elves, in&s;ignificant particles, which we are obliged to employ as connectives to our &s;ignificant words. Our method gives almo&s;t the &s;ame expo&s;ure to the one as to the other, making the &s;ignificant parts, and the in&s;ignificant, equally con&s;picuous; theirs, much oftener &s;inks, as it were, the former into the latter, at once pre&s;erving their u&s;e, and hiding their weakne&s;s. Our modern Languages may, in this re&s;pect, be compared to the art of the carpenter in its rude&s;t &s;tate; when the union of the materials, employed by the arti&s;an, could be effected on|ly by the help of tho&s;e external and coar&s;e implements, pins, nails, and cramps. The antient Languages re&s;emble the &s;ame art in its mo&s;t improved &s;tate, after the invention of dovetail joints, grooves, and mortices; when thus all the principal junctions are effected, by forming properly, the ex|tremities, or terminations, of the pieces to be joined.

By Dr. Camp|bell, vol. ii. p. 412.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>PRONOUNS are the cla&s;s of words mo&s;t nearly related to &s;ub&s;tantive nouns; being, as the name imports, repre&s;entatives, or &s;ub|&s;titutes, of nouns. <HI>I, thou, he, &s;he,</HI> and <HI>it,</HI> are no other than an abridged way of nam|ing the per&s;ons, or objects, with which we have immediate intercour&s;e, or to which we are obliged frequently to refer in di&s;cour&s;e. Accordingly, they are &s;ubject to the &s;ame modifications with &s;ub&s;tantive nouns, of number, gender, and ca&s;e. Only, with re|&s;pect to gender, we may ob&s;erve, that the pronouns of the fir&s;t and &s;econd per&s;on, as
<PB N="184" REF="190">
they are called, <HI>I</HI> and <HI>thou,</HI> do not appear to have had the di&s;tinctions of gender given them in any Language; for this plain rea&s;on, that, as they always refer to per&s;ons who are pre&s;ent to each other, when they &s;peak, their &s;ex mu&s;t appear, and therefore needs not be marked by a ma&s;culine or feminine pronoun. But, as the third per&s;on may be ab&s;ent, or unknown, the di&s;tinction of gender there becomes nece&s;&s;ary; and accordingly, in En|gli&s;h, it hath all the three genders belonging to it; <HI>he, &s;he, it.</HI> As to ca&s;es; even tho&s;e Languages which have dropped them in &s;ub|&s;tantive nouns, &s;ometimes retain more of them in pronouns, for the &s;ake of the greater readine&s;s in expre&s;&s;ing relations; as pronouns are words of &s;uch frequent occurrence in di&s;|cour&s;e. In Engli&s;h, mo&s;t of our grammari|ans hold the per&s;onal pronouns to have two ca&s;es, be&s;ides the nominative; a genitive, and an accu&s;ative,&mdash;<HI>I, mine, me;&mdash;thou, thine, thee;&mdash;he, his, him;&mdash;who, who&s;e, whom.</HI></P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t &s;tage of Speech, it is probable that the places of tho&s;e pronouns were &s;up|plied, by pointing to the object when pre|&s;ent, and naming it when ab&s;ent. For one can hardly think that pronouns were of early invention; as they are words of &s;uch a par|ticular and artificial nature. <HI>I, thou, he, it,</HI> it is to be ob&s;erved, are not names peculiar to any &s;ingle object, but &s;o very general, that they may be applied to all per&s;ons, or objects, whatever, in certain circum&s;tances. <HI>It,</HI> is
<PB N="185" REF="191">
the mo&s;t general term that can po&s;&s;ibly be conceived, as it may &s;tand for any one thing in the univer&s;e, of which we &s;peak. At the &s;ame time, the&s;e pronouns have this quality, that, in the circum&s;tances in which they are applied, they never denote more than one preci&s;e individual; which they a&s;certain, and &s;pecify, much in the &s;ame manner as is done by the article. So that pronous are, at once, the mo&s;t general, and the mo&s;t particular words in Language. They are commonly the mo&s;t irregular and trouble&s;ome words to the learner, in the Grammar of all Tongues; as being the words mo&s;t in common u&s;e, and &s;ubjected thereby to the greate&s;t varieties.</P>
<P>ADJECTIVES, or terms of quality, &s;uch as, <HI>great, little, black, white, yours, ours,</HI> are the plaine&s;t and &s;imple&s;t of all that cla&s;s of words which are termed attributive. They are found in all Languages; and, in all Lan|guages, mu&s;t have been very early invented; as objects could not be di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other, nor any intercour&s;e be carried on concerning them, till once names were given to their different qualities.</P>
<P>I HAVE nothing to ob&s;erve in relation to them, except that &s;ingularity which attends them in the Greek and Latin, of having the &s;ame form given them with &s;ub&s;tantive nouns; being declined, like them, by ca&s;es, and &s;ub|jected to the like di&s;tinctions of number and gender. Whence it has happened, that gram|marians
<PB N="186" REF="192">
have made them to belong to the &s;ame part of Speech, and divided the noun into &s;ub&s;tantive and adjective; an arrange|ment, founded more on attention to the ex|ternal form of words, than to their nature and force. For adjectives, or terms of qua|lity, have not, by their nature, the lea&s;t re|&s;emblance to &s;ub&s;tantive nouns, as they never expre&s;s any thing which can po&s;&s;ibly &s;ub&s;i&s;t by it&s;elf; which is the very e&s;&s;ence of the &s;ub&s;tantive noun. They are, indeed, more a-kin to verbs, which, like them, expre&s;s the attribute of &s;ome &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>IT may, at fir&s;t view, appear &s;omewhat odd and fanta&s;tic, that adjectives &s;hould, in the&s;e antient Languages, have a&s;&s;umed &s;o much the form of &s;ub&s;tantives; &s;ince neither number, nor gender, nor ca&s;es, nor relations, have any thing to do, in a proper &s;en&s;e, with mere qualities, &s;uch as, <HI>good</HI> or <HI>great, &s;oft</HI> or <HI>hard.</HI> And yet <HI>bonus,</HI> and <HI>magnus,</HI> and <HI>tener,</HI> have their &s;ingular and plural, their ma&s;culine and feminine, their genitives and datives, like any of the names of &s;ub&s;tances, or per|&s;ons. But this can be accounted for, from the genius of tho&s;e Tongues. They avoided, as much as po&s;&s;ible, con&s;idering qualities &s;e|parately, or in the ab&s;tract. They made them a part, or appendage, of the &s;ub&s;tance which they &s;erved to di&s;tingui&s;h; they made the adjective depend on its &s;ub&s;tantive, and re|&s;emble it in termination, in number, and gender, in order that the two might coale&s;ce
<PB N="187" REF="193">
the more intimately, and be joined in the form of expre&s;&s;ion, as they were in the na|ture of things. The liberty of tran&s;po&s;ition, too, which tho&s;e Languages indulged, requir|ed &s;uch a method as this to be followed. For, allowing the related words of a &s;entence to be placed at a di&s;tance from each other, it re|quired the relation of adjectives to their pro|per &s;ub&s;tantives to be pointed out, by &s;uch &s;imilar circum&s;tances of form and termina|tion, as, according to the grammatical &s;tyle, &s;hould &s;how their concordance. When I &s;ay, in Engli&s;h, the <Q REND="inline">"Beautiful wife of a brave man,"</Q> the juxtapo&s;ition of the words pre|vents all ambiguity. But when I &s;ay, in La|tin, <Q REND="inline">"Formo&s;a fortis viri uxor;"</Q> it is only the agreement, in gender, number, and ca&s;e, of the adjective <Q REND="inline">"<HI>formo&s;a,</HI>"</Q> which is the fir&s;t word of the &s;entence, with the &s;ub&s;tantive <Q REND="inline">"<HI>uxor,</HI>"</Q> which is the la&s;t word that declares the meaning.</P>

<HEAD>LECTURE IX. STRUCTURE OF LANGUAGE. ENGLISH TONGUE.</HEAD>
<P>OF the whole cla&s;s of words that are call|ed attributive, indeed, of all the parts of Speech, the mo&s;t complex, by far, is the verb. It is chiefly in this part of Speech, that the &s;ubtile and profound metaphy&s;ic of Language appears; and, therefore, in exa|mining the nature and different variations of the verb, there might be room for ample di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion. But as I am &s;en&s;ible that &s;uch gram|matical di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, when they are pur&s;ued far, become intricate and ob&s;cure, I &s;hall avoid dwelling any longer on this &s;ubject, than &s;eems ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>THE verb is &s;o far of the &s;ame nature with the adjective, that it expre&s;&s;es, like it, an attribute, or propriety, of &s;ome per&s;on or thing. But it does more than this. For, in all verbs, in every Language, there are no
<PB N="189" REF="195">
le&s;s than three things implied at once; the attribute of &s;ome &s;ub&s;tantive, an affirmation concerning that attribute, and time. Thus, when I &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"the &s;un &s;hineth."</Q> Shining, is the attribute a&s;cribed to the &s;un; the pre&s;ent time is marked; and an affirmation is in|cluded, that this property of &s;hining belongs, at that time, to the &s;un. The participle, <Q REND="inline">"&s;hining,"</Q> is merely an adjective, which de|notes an attribute, or property, and al&s;o ex|pre&s;&s;es time; but carries no affirmation. The infinitive mood, <Q REND="inline">"to &s;hine,"</Q> may be called the name of the verb; it carries neither time nor affirmation; but &s;imply expre&s;&s;es that attribute, action, or &s;tate of things, which is to be the &s;ubject of the other moods and ten&s;es. Hence the infinitive is often a-kin to a &s;ub&s;tantive noun; and, both in Engli&s;h and Latin, is &s;ometimes con&s;tructed as &s;uch. As, <Q REND="inline">"Scire tuum nihil e&s;t." Dulce et deco|rum e&s;t pro patria mori."</Q> And, in Engli&s;h, in the &s;ame manner. <Q REND="inline">"To write well is difficult; to &s;peak eloquently is &s;till more difficult."</Q> But as, through all the other ten&s;es and moods, the affirmation runs, and is e&s;&s;ential to them; <Q REND="inline">"the &s;un &s;hineth, was &s;hining, &s;hone, will &s;hine, would have &s;hone," &amp;c.</Q> the affirmation &s;eems to be that which chiefly di&s;tingui&s;hes the verb from the other parts of Speech, and gives it its mo&s;t con&s;picuous power. Hence there can be no &s;entence or complete propo&s;ition, with|out a verb either expre&s;&s;ed or implied. For, whenever we &s;peak, we always mean to a&s;&s;ert,
<PB N="190" REF="196">
that &s;omething is, or is not; and the word which carries this a&s;&s;ertion, or affirmation, is a verb. From this &s;ort of eminence belonging to it, this part of Speech hath received its name; verb, from the Latin, <HI>verbum,</HI> or <HI>the word,</HI> by way of di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>VERBS, therefore, from their importance and nece&s;&s;ity in Speech, mu&s;t have been co&euml;|val with men's fir&s;t attempts towards the formation of Language: Though, indeed, it mu&s;t have been the work of long time, to rear them up to that accurate and complex &s;tructure, which they now po&s;&s;e&s;s. It &s;eems very probable, as Dr. Smith hath &s;ugge&s;ted, that the radical verb, or the fir&s;t form of it, in mo&s;t Languages, would be, what we now call, the Imper&s;onal Verb. <Q REND="inline">"It rains; it thunders; it is light; it is agreeable;"</Q> and the like; as this is the very &s;imple&s;t form of the verb, and merely affirms the exi&s;tence of an event, or of a &s;tate of things. By de|grees, after pronouns were invented, &s;uch verbs became per&s;onal, and were branched out into all the variety of ten&s;es and moods.</P>
<P>THE ten&s;es of the verb are contrived to imply the &s;everal di&s;tinctions of time. Of the&s;e, I mu&s;t take &s;ome notice, in order to &s;how the admirable accuracy with which Language is con&s;tructed. We think, com|monly, of no more than the three great di|vi&s;ions of time, into the pa&s;t, the pre&s;ent, and the future: and we might imagine, that
<PB N="191" REF="197">
if verbs had been &s;o contrived, as &s;imply to expre&s;s the&s;e, no more was needful. But Language proceeds with much greater &s;ub|tilty. It &s;plits time into its &s;everal moments. It con&s;iders time as never &s;tanding &s;till, but always flowing; things pa&s;t, as more or le&s;s perfectly completed; and things future, as more or le&s;s remote, by different gradations. Hence the great variety of ten&s;es in mo&s;t Tongues.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent may, indeed, be always con|&s;idered as one indivi&s;ible point, &s;u&s;ceptible of no variety. <Q REND="inline">"I write, or, I am writing; <HI>&s;cribo.</HI>"</Q> But it is not &s;o with the pa&s;t. There is no Language &s;o poor, but it hath two or three ten&s;es to expre&s;s the varieties of it. Ours hath no fewer than four. 1. A pa&s;t action may be con&s;idered as left unfi|ni&s;hed; which makes the imperfect ten&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"I was writing; <HI>&s;cribebam.</HI>"</Q> 2. As ju&s;t now fini&s;hed. This makes the proper perfect ten&s;e, which, in Engli&s;h, is always expre&s;&s;ed by the help of the auxiliary verb, <Q REND="inline">"I have written."</Q> 3. It may be con&s;idered as fi|ni&s;hed &s;ome time ago; the particular time left indefinite. <Q REND="inline">"I wrote; <HI>&s;crip&s;i;</HI>"</Q> which may either &s;ignify, <Q REND="inline">"I wrote ye&s;terday, or I wrote a twelvemonth ago."</Q> This is what grammarians call an a&ouml;ri&s;t, or indefinite pa&s;t. 4. It may be con&s;idered as fini&s;hed before &s;omething el&s;e, which is al&s;o pa&s;t. This is the plu&s;quamperfect. <Q REND="inline">"I had written; <HI>&s;crip|&s;eram.</HI>
<PB N="192" REF="198">
I had written before I received his letter."</Q></P>
<P>HERE we ob&s;erve, with &s;ome plea&s;ure, that we have an advantage over the Latins, who have only three varieties upon the pa&s;t time. They have no proper perfect ten&s;e, or one which di&s;tingui&s;hes an action ju&s;t now fini&s;hed, from an action that was fini&s;hed &s;ome time ago. In both the&s;e ca&s;es, they mu&s;t &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>&s;crip&s;i.</HI>"</Q> Though there be a ma|nife&s;t difference in the ten&s;es, which our Language expre&s;&s;es, by this variation, <Q REND="inline">"I have written,"</Q> meaning, I have ju&s;t now fini&s;hed writing; and, <Q REND="inline">"I wrote,"</Q> meaning at &s;ome former time, &s;ince which, other things have intervened. This difference the Ro|mans have no ten&s;e to expre&s;s; and, there|fore, can only do it by a circumlocution.</P>
<P>THE chief varieties in the future time are two; a &s;imple or indefinite future: <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall write; <HI>&s;cribam:</HI>"</Q> And a future, relating to &s;omething el&s;e, which is al&s;o future. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall have written; <HI>&s;crip&s;ero.</HI>"</Q> I &s;hall have written before he arrives<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the ten&s;es of verbs, Mr. Harris's Hermes may be con|&s;ulted, by &s;uch as de&s;ire to &s;ee them &s;crutinized with metaphy|&s;ical accuracy; and al&s;o, the Treati&s;e on the Origin and Pro|gre&s;s of Language, Vol. ii. p. 125.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BESIDES ten&s;es, or the power of expre&s;|&s;ing time, verbs admit the di&s;tinction of Voices, as they are called, the active and
<PB N="193" REF="199">
the pa&s;&s;ive; according as the affirmation re|&s;pects &s;omething that is done, or &s;omething that is &s;uffered; <Q REND="inline">"I love, or I am loved."</Q> They admit al&s;o the di&s;tinction of moods, which are de&s;igned to expre&s;s the affirma|tion, whether active or pa&s;&s;ive, under differ|ent forms. The indicative mood, for in|&s;tance, &s;imply declares a propo&s;ition, <Q REND="inline">"I write; I have written;"</Q> the imperative re|quires, commands, threatens, <Q REND="inline">"write thou; let him write."</Q> The &s;ubjunctive expre&s;&s;es the propo&s;ition under the form of a condi|tion, or in &s;ubordination to &s;ome other thing, to which a reference is made, <Q REND="inline">"I might write, I could write, I &s;hould write, if the ca&s;e were &s;o and &s;o."</Q> This manner of expre&s;|&s;ing an affirmation, under &s;o many different forms, together al&s;o with the di&s;tinction of the three per&s;ons, <HI>I, thou,</HI> and <HI>he,</HI> con&s;titutes what is called, the conjugation of verbs, which makes &s;o great a part of the grammar of all Languages.</P>
<P>IT now clearly appears, as I before ob&s;erv|ed, that, of all the parts of Speech, verbs are, by far, the mo&s;t artificial and complex. Con&s;ider only, how many things are denoted by this &s;ingle Latin word <Q REND="inline">"<HI>amavi&s;&s;em,</HI> I would have loved."</Q> Fir&s;t, The per&s;on who &s;peaks, <Q REND="inline">"I."</Q> Secondly, An attribute, or action of that per&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"loving."</Q> Thirdly, An affir|mation concerning that action. Fourthly, The pa&s;t time denoted in that affirmation, <Q REND="inline">"have loved:"</Q> and, Fifthly, A condition on
<PB N="194" REF="200">
which the action is &s;u&s;pended, <Q REND="inline">"would have loved."</Q> It appears curious and remarkable, that words of this complex import, and with more or le&s;s of this artifical &s;tructure, are to be found, as far as we know, in all Languages of the world.</P>
<P>INDEED, the form of conjugation, or the manner of expre&s;&s;ing all the&s;e varieties in the verb, differs greatly in different Tongues. Conjugation is e&s;teemed mo&s;t perfect in tho&s;e Languages, which, by varying either the ter|mination or the initial &s;yllable of the verb, expre&s;s the greate&s;t number of important cir|cum&s;tances, without the help of auxiliary words. In the Oriental Tongues, the verbs are &s;aid to have few ten&s;es, or expre&s;&s;ions of time; but then their moods are &s;o con|trived, as to expre&s;s a great variety of cir|cum&s;tances and relations. In the Hebrew, for in&s;tance, they &s;ay, in one word, without the help of any auxiliary, not only <Q REND="inline">"I have taught,"</Q> but, <Q REND="inline">"I have taught exactly, or often; I have been commanded to teach; I have taught my&s;elf."</Q> The Greek, which is the mo&s;t perfect of all the known Tongues, is very regular and complete in all the ten&s;es and moods. The Latin is formed on the &s;ame model, but more imperfect; e&s;pecially in the pa&s;&s;ive voice, which forms mo&s;t of the ten&s;es by the help of the auxiliary <Q REND="inline">"<HI>&s;um.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>IN all the modern European Tongues, con|jugation is very defective. They admit few
<PB N="195" REF="201">
varieties in the termination of the verb it&s;elf; but have almo&s;t con&s;tant recour&s;e to their auxiliary verbs, throughout all the moods and ten&s;es, both active and pa&s;&s;ive. Lan|guage has undergone a change in conjugation, perfectly &s;imilar to that which, I &s;howed in the la&s;t Lecture, it underwent with re&s;pect to declen&s;ion. As prepo&s;itions, prefixed to the noun, &s;uper&s;eded the u&s;e of ca&s;es; &s;o the two great auxiliary verbs, to <HI>have,</HI> and to <HI>be,</HI> with tho&s;e other auxiliaries which we u&s;e in Engli&s;h, <HI>do, &s;hall, will, may,</HI> and <HI>can,</HI> pre|fixed to the participle, &s;uper&s;ede, in a great mea&s;ure, the different terminations of moods and ten&s;es, which formed the antient conju|gations.</P>
<P>THE alteration, in both ca&s;es, was owing to the &s;ame cau&s;e, and will be ea&s;ily under|&s;tood, from reflecting on what was formerly ob&s;erved. The auxiliary verbs are like pre|po&s;itions, words of a very general and ab|&s;tract nature. They imply the different mo|difications of &s;imple exi&s;tence, con&s;idered alone, and without reference to any parti|cular thing. In the early &s;tate of Speech, the import of them would be incorporated, &s;o to &s;peak, with every particular verb in its ten&s;es and moods, long before words were invented for denoting &s;uch ab&s;tract concep|tions of exi&s;tence, alone, and by them&s;elves. But after tho&s;e auxiliary verbs came, in the progre&s;s of Language, to be invented and known, and to have ten&s;es and moods given
<PB N="196" REF="202">
to them like other verbs; it was found, that as they carried in their nature the force of that affirmation which di&s;tingui&s;hes the verb, they might, by being joined with the parti|ciple which gives the meaning of the verb, &s;upply the place of mo&s;t of the moods and ten&s;es. Hence, as the modern Tongues be|gan to ri&s;e out of the ruins of the antient, this method e&s;tabli&s;hed it&s;elf in the new form|ation of Speech. Such words, for in&s;tance; as, <HI>am, was, have, &s;hall,</HI> being once familiar, it appeared more ea&s;y to apply the&s;e to any verb whatever; as, <HI>I am loved; I was loved; I have loved;</HI> than to remember that variety of terminations which were requi&s;ite in con|jugating the antient verbs, <HI>amor, amabar, amavi,</HI> &amp;c. Two or three varieties only, in the termination of the verb, were retained, as, <HI>love, loved, loving;</HI> and all the re&s;t were dropt. The con&s;equence, however, of this practice, was the &s;ame as that of aboli&s;hing declen&s;ions. It rendered Language more &s;imple and ea&s;y in its &s;tructure; but withal, more prolix, and le&s;s graceful. This fini&s;hes all that &s;eemed mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved with re&s;pect to verbs.</P>
<P>THE remaining parts of Speech, which are called the indeclinable parts, or that admit of no variations, will not detain as long.</P>
<P>ADVERBS are the fir&s;t that occur. The&s;e form a very numerous cla&s;s of words in eve|ry Language, reducible, in general, to the
<PB N="197" REF="203">
head of attributives; as they &s;erve to modi|fy, or to denote &s;ome circum&s;tance of an action, or of a quality, relative to its time, place, order, degree, and the other proper|ties of it, which we have occa&s;ion to &s;pecify. They are, for the mo&s;t part, no more than an abridged mode of Speech, expre&s;&s;ing, by one word, what might, by a circumlocution, be re&s;olved into two or more words belong|ing to the other parts of Speech. <Q REND="inline">"Exceed|ingly,"</Q> for in&s;tance, is the &s;ame as, <Q REND="inline">"in a high degree;"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"bravely,"</Q> the &s;ame as, <Q REND="inline">"with bravery or valour;"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"here,"</Q> the &s;ame as, <Q REND="inline">"in this place;"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"often, and &s;eldom,"</Q> the &s;ame as, <Q REND="inline">"for many and for few times:"</Q> and &s;o of the re&s;t. Hence, adverbs may be conceived as of le&s;s nece&s;&s;ity, and of later introduction into the &s;y&s;tem of Speech, than many other cla&s;&s;es of words; and, accord|ingly, the great body of them are derived from other words formerly e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Language.</P>
<P>PREPOSITIONS and conjunctions, are words more e&s;&s;ential to di&s;cour&s;e than the greate&s;t part of adverbs. They form that cla&s;s of words, called Connectives, without which there could be no Language; &s;erving to ex|pre&s;s the relations which things bear to one another, their mutual influence, dependen|cies, and coherence; thereby joining words together into intelligible and &s;ignificant pro|po&s;itions. Conjunctions are generally em|ployed for connecting &s;entences, or members
<PB N="198" REF="204">
of &s;entences; as, <HI>and, becau&s;e, although,</HI> and the like. Prepo&s;itions are employed for con|necting words, by &s;howing the relation which one &s;ub&s;tantive noun bears to another; as, <HI>of, from, to, above, below,</HI> &amp;c. Of the force of the&s;e I had occa&s;ion to &s;peak before, when treating of the ca&s;es and declen&s;ions of &s;ub|&s;tantive nouns.</P>
<P>IT is abundantly evident, that all the&s;e connective particles mu&s;t be of the greate&s;t u&s;e in Speech; &s;eeing they point out the re|lations and tran&s;itions by which the mind pa&s;&s;es from one idea to another. They are the foundation of all rea&s;oning, which is no other thing than the connection of thoughts. And, therefore, though among barbarous nations, and in the rude uncivili&s;ed ages of the world, the &s;tock of the&s;e words might be &s;mall, it mu&s;t always have increa&s;ed, as man|kind advanced in the arts of rea&s;oning and reflection. The more any nation is improv|ed by &s;cience, and the more perfect their Language becomes, we may naturally expect, that it will abound the more with connec|tive particles; expre&s;&s;ing relations of things, and tran&s;itions of thought, which had e&s;caped a gro&s;&s;er view. Accordingly, no Tongue is &s;o full of them as the Greek, in con&s;equence of the acute and &s;ubtile genius of that re|fined people. In every Language, much of the beauty and &s;trength of it depends on the proper u&s;e of conjunctions, prepo&s;itions, and tho&s;e relative pronouns, which al&s;o &s;erve the
<PB N="199" REF="205">
&s;ame purpo&s;e of connecting the different parts of di&s;cour&s;e. It is the right, or wrong management of the&s;e, which chiefly makes di&s;cour&s;e appear firm and compacted, or dis|jointed and loo&s;e; which cau&s;es it to march with a &s;mooth and even pace, or with gouty and hobbling &s;teps.</P>
<P>I SHALL dwell no longer on the general con&s;truction of Language. Allow me, only, before I di&s;mi&s;s the &s;ubject, to ob&s;erve, that dry and intricate as it may &s;eem to &s;ome, it is, however, of great importance, and very nearly connected with the philo&s;ophy of the human mind. For, if Speech be the vehicle, or interpreter of the conceptions of our minds, an examination of its Structure and Progre&s;s cannot but unfold many things concerning the nature and progre&s;s of our conceptions them&s;elves, and the operations of our facul|ties; a &s;ubject that is always in&s;tructive to man, <Q REND="inline">"Nequis,"</Q> &s;ays Quinctilian, an au|thor of excellent judgment, <Q REND="inline">"nequis tan|quam parva fa&s;tidiat grammatices elementa.

LET us now come nearer to our own Lan|guage. In this, and the preceding Lecture, &s;ome ob&s;ervations have already been made on its Structure. But it is proper, that we &s;hould be a little more particular in the exa|mination of it.</P>
<P>THE Language which is, at pre&s;ent, &s;poken throughout Great Britain, is neither the an|tient primitive Speech of the i&s;land, nor de|rived from it; but is altogether of foreign origin. The Language of the fir&s;t inhabi|tants of our i&s;land, beyond doubt, was the Celtic, or Gaelic, common to them with Gaul; from which country, it appears, by many circum&s;tances, that Great Britain was peopled. This Celtic Tongue, which is &s;aid to be very expre&s;&s;ive and copious, and is, pro|bably, one of the mo&s;t antient Languages in the world, obtained once in mo&s;t of the we&s;t|ern regions of Europe. It was the Language of Gaul, of Great Britain, of Ireland, and, very probably, of Spain al&s;o; till, in the cour&s;e of tho&s;e revolutions, which, by means of the conque&s;ts, fir&s;t, of the Romans, and afterwards, of the northern nations, changed the government, &s;peech, and, in a manner,
<PB N="201" REF="207">
the whole face of Europe, this Tongue was gradually obliterated; and now &s;ub&s;i&s;ts only in the mountains of Wales, in the Highlands of Scotland, and among the wild Iri&s;h. For the Iri&s;h, the Welch, and the Er&s;e, are no other than different dialects of the &s;ame Tongue, the antient Celtic.</P>
<P>THIS, then, was the Language of the pri|mitive Britons, the fir&s;t inhabitants, that we know of, in our i&s;land; and continued &s;o till the arrival of the Saxons in England, in the year of our Lord 450; who, having conquer|ed the Britons, did not intermix with them, but expelled them from their habitations, and drove them, together with their Language, into the mountains of Wales. The Saxons were one of tho&s;e northern nations that over|ran Europe; and their Tongue, a dialect of the Gothic or Teutonic, altogether di&s;tinct from the Celtic, laid the foundation of the pre&s;ent Engli&s;h Tongue. With &s;ome inter|mixture of Dani&s;h, a Language, probably, from the &s;ame root with the Saxon, it con|tinued to be &s;poken throughout the &s;outhern part of the I&s;land, till the time of William the Conqueror. He introduced his Norman or French as the Language of the court, which made a con&s;iderable change in the Speech of the nation; and the Engli&s;h, which was &s;poken afterwards, and continues to be &s;poken now, is a mixture of the antient Saxon, and this Norman French, together with &s;uch new and foreign words as com|merce
<PB N="202" REF="208">
and learning have, in progre&s;s of time, gradually introduced.</P>
<P>THE hi&s;tory of the Engli&s;h Language can, in this manner, be clearly traced. The Lan|guage &s;poken in the low countries of Scot|land, is now, and has been for many centu|ries, no other than a dialect of the Engli&s;h. How, indeed, or by what &s;teps, the antient Celtic Tongue came to be bani&s;hed from the Low Country in Scotland, and to make its retreat into the Highlands and I&s;lands, can|not be &s;o well pointed out, as how the like revolution was brought about in England. Whether the &s;outhernmo&s;t part of Scotland was once &s;ubject to the Saxons, and formed a part of the kingdom of Northumberland; or, whether the great number of Engli&s;h exiles that retreated into Scotland, upon the Norman conque&s;t, and upon other occa&s;ions, introduced into that country their own Lan|guage, which afterwards, by the mutual in|tercour&s;e of the two nations, prevailed over the Celtic, are uncertain and conte&s;ted points, the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of which would lead us too far from our &s;ubject.</P>
<P>FROM what has been &s;aid, it appears, that the Teutonic dialect is the ba&s;is of our pre|&s;ent Speech. It has been imported among us in three different forms, the Saxon, the Dani&s;h, and the Norman; all which have mingled together in our Language. A very great number of our words too, are plainly
<PB N="203" REF="209">
derived from the Latin. The&s;e, we had not directly from the Latin, but mo&s;t of them, it is probable, entered into our Tongue through the channel of that Norman French, which William the Conqueror introduced. For, as the Romans had long been in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Gaul, the Language &s;poken in that country, when it was invaded by the Franks and Normans, was a &s;ort of corrupt|ed Latin, mingled with Celtic, to which was given the name of Roman&s;he: and as the Franks and Normans did not, like the Saxons in England, expel the inhabitants, but, after their victories, mingled with them; the Lan|guage of the country became a compound of the Teutonic dialect imported by the&s;e con|querors, and of the former corrupted Latin. Hence, the French Language has always continued to have a very con&s;iderable affi|nity with the Latin; and hence, a great number of words of Latin origin, which were in u&s;e among the Normans in France, were introduced into our Tongue at the conque&s;t; to which, indeed, many have &s;ince been ad|ded, directly from the Latin, in con&s;equence of the great diffu&s;ion of Roman literature throughout all Europe.</P>
<P>FROM the influx of &s;o many &s;treams, from the junction of &s;o many di&s;&s;imilar parts, it naturally follows, that the Engli&s;h, like every compounded Language, mu&s;t needs be &s;ome|what irregular. We cannot expect from it that corre&s;pondence of parts, that complete
<PB N="204" REF="210">
analogy in &s;tructure, which may be found in tho&s;e &s;impler Languages, which have been formed in a manner within them&s;elves, and built on one foundation. Hence, as I before &s;howed, it has but &s;mall remains of conju|gation or declen&s;ion; and its &s;yntax is nar|row, as there are few marks in the words them&s;elves that can &s;how their relation to each other, or, in the grammatical &s;tyle, point out either their concordance, or their government, in the &s;entence. Our words having been brought to us from &s;everal dif|ferent regions, &s;traggle, if we may &s;o &s;peak, a&s;under from each other; and do not coale&s;ce &s;o naturally in the &s;tructure of a &s;entence, as the words in the Greek and Roman Tongues.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e di&s;advantages, if they be &s;uch, of a compound Language, are balanced by other advantages that attend it; particularly, by the number and variety of words with which &s;uch a Language is likely to be en|riched. Few Languages are, in fact, more copious than the Engli&s;h. In all grave &s;ub|jects e&s;pecially, hi&s;torical, critical, political, and moral, no writer has the lea&s;t rea&s;on to complain of the barrenne&s;s of our Tongue. The &s;tudious reflecting genius of the people, has brought together great &s;tore of expre&s;&s;i|ons, on &s;uch &s;ubjects, from every quarter. We are rich too in the Language of poetry. Our poetical &s;tyle differs widely from pro&s;e, not in point of numbers only, but in the ve|ry
<PB N="205" REF="211">
words them&s;elves; which &s;hows what a &s;tock and compa&s;s of words we have it in our power to &s;elect and employ, &s;uited to tho&s;e different occa&s;ions. Herein we are in|finitely &s;uperior to the French, who&s;e poeti|cal Language, if it were not di&s;tingui&s;hed by rhyme, would not be known to differ from their ordinary pro&s;e.</P>
<P>IT is chiefly, indeed, on grave &s;ubjects, and with re&s;pect to the &s;tronger emotions of the mind, that our Language di&s;plays its power of expre&s;&s;ion. We are &s;aid to have thirty words, at lea&s;t, for denoting all the va|rieties of the pa&s;&s;ion of anger<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Anger, wrath, pa&s;&s;ion, rage, fury, outrage, fiercene&s;s, &s;harpne&s;s, animo&s;ity, choler, re&s;entment, heat, heart-burn|ing; to fume, &s;torm, inflame, be incen&s;ed; to vex, kindle, irritate, enrage, exa&s;perate, provoke, fret; to be &s;ullen, ha&s;ty, hot, rough, &s;our, peevi&s;h, &amp;c.
<BIBL>Preface to Greenwood's Grammar.</BIBL></NOTE>. But, in de|&s;cribing the more delicate &s;entiments and emotions, our Tongue is not &s;o fertile. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the French Lan|guage &s;urpa&s;&s;es ours, by far, in expre&s;&s;ing the nicer &s;hades of character; e&s;pecially tho&s;e varieties of manner, temper, and behaviour, which are di&s;played in our &s;ocial intercour&s;e with one another. Let any one attempt to tran&s;late, into Engli&s;h, only a few pages of one of Marivaux's Novels, and he will &s;oon be &s;en&s;ible of our deficiency of expre&s;&s;ion on the&s;e &s;ubjects. Indeed, no Language is &s;o copious as the French for whatever is de|licate,

gay, and amu&s;ing. It is, perhaps, the happie&s;t Language for conver&s;ation in the known world; but, on the higher &s;ubjects of compo&s;ition, the Engli&s;h may be ju&s;tly e&s;teemed to excel it con&s;iderably.</P>
<P>LANGUAGE is generally under&s;tood to re|ceive its predominant tincture from the na|tional character of the people who &s;peak it. We mu&s;t not, indeed, expect, that it will carry an exact and full impre&s;&s;ion of their genius and manners; for, among all nations, the original &s;tock of words which they re|ceived from their ance&s;tors, remain as the foundation of their Speech throughout many ages, while their manners undergo, perhaps, very great alterations. National character will, however, always have &s;ome perceptible influence on the turn of Language; and the gaiety and vivacity of the French, and the gravity and thoughtfulne&s;s of the Engli&s;h, are &s;ufficiently impre&s;&s;ed on their re&s;pective Tongues.</P>
<P>FROM the genius of our Language, and the character of tho&s;e who &s;peak it, it may be expected to have &s;trength and energy. It is, indeed, naturally prolix; owing to the great number of particles and auxiliary verbs which we are obliged con&s;tantly to employ; and this prolixity mu&s;t, in &s;ome degree, en|feeble it. We &s;eldom can expre&s;s &s;o much by one word as was done by the verbs, and by the nouns, in the Greek and Roman Lan|guages.
<PB N="207" REF="213">
Our &s;tyle is le&s;s compact; our con|ceptions being &s;pread out among more words, and &s;plit, as it were, into more parts, make a fainter impre&s;&s;ion when we utter them. Notwith&s;tanding this defect, by our abound|ing in terms for expre&s;&s;ing all the &s;trong emo|tions of the mind, and by the liberty which we enjoy, in a greater degree than mo&s;t na|tions, of compounding words, our Language may be e&s;teemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s con&s;iderable force of expre&s;&s;ion; comparatively, at lea&s;t, with the other modern Tongues, though much below the antient. The Style of Milton alone, both in poetry and pro&s;e, is a &s;uffici|ent proof, that the Engli&s;h Tongue is far from being de&s;titute of nerves and energy.</P>
<P>THE flexibility of a Language, or its pow|er of accommodation to different &s;tyles and manners, &s;o as to be either grave and &s;trong, or ea&s;y and flowing, or tender and gentle, or pompous and magnificent, as occa&s;ions re|quire, or as an author's genius prompts, is a quality of great importance in &s;peaking and writing. It &s;eems to depend upon three things; the copiou&s;ne&s;s of a Language; the different arrangements of which its words are &s;u&s;ceptible; and the variety and beauty of the &s;ound of tho&s;e words, &s;o as to corre&s;pond to many different &s;ubjects. Never did any Tongue po&s;&s;e&s;s this quality &s;o eminently as the Greek, which every writer of genius could &s;o mould, as to make the &s;tyle perfectly ex|pre&s;&s;ive of his own manner and peculiar
<PB N="208" REF="214">
turn. It had all the three requi&s;ites, which I have mentioned, as nece&s;&s;ary for this pur|po&s;e. It joined to the&s;e the graceful variety of its different dialects; and thereby readily a&s;&s;umed every &s;ort of character which an au|thor could wi&s;h, from the mo&s;t &s;imple and mo&s;t familiar, up to the mo&s;t maje&s;tic. The Latin, though a very beautiful Language, is inferior, in this re&s;pect, to the Greek. It has more of a fixed character of &s;tateline&s;s and gravity. It is always firm and ma&s;culine in the tenor of its &s;ound; and is &s;upported by a certain &s;enatorial dignity, of which it is difficult for a writer to dive&s;t it wholly, on any occa&s;ion. Among the modern Tongues, the Italian po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a great deal more of this flexibility than the French. By its copiou&s;|ne&s;s, its freedom of arrangement, and the great beauty and harmony of its &s;ounds, it &s;uits it&s;elf very happily to mo&s;t &s;ubjects, either in pro&s;e or in poetry; is capable of the au|gu&s;t and the &s;trong, as well as the tender; and &s;eems to be, on the whole, the mo&s;t per|fect of all the modern dialects which have ari&s;en out of the ruins of the antient. Our own Language, though not equal to the Ita|lian in flexibility, yet is not de&s;titute of a con&s;iderable degree of this quality. If any one will con&s;ider the diver&s;ity of &s;tyle which appears in &s;ome of our cla&s;&s;ics; that great difference of manner, for in&s;tance, which is marked by the Style of Lord Shaft&s;bury, and that of Dean Swift; he will &s;ee, in our Tongue, &s;uch a circle of expre&s;&s;ion, &s;uch a
<PB N="209" REF="215">
power of accommodation to the different ta&s;te of writers, as redounds not a little to its honour.</P>
<P>WHAT the Engli&s;h has been mo&s;t taxed with, is its deficiency in harmony of &s;ound. But though every native is apt to be partial to the &s;ounds of his own Language, and may, therefore, be &s;u&s;pected of not being a fair judge in this point; yet, I imagine, there are evident grounds on which it may be &s;hown, that this charge again&s;t our Tongue has been carried too far. The melody of our ver&s;ification, its power of &s;upporting poeti|cal numbers, without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from rhyme, is alone a &s;ufficient proof that our Lan|guage is far from being unmu&s;ical. Our ver&s;e is, after the Italian, the mo&s;t diver&s;ified and harmonious of any of the modern dialects; unque&s;tionably far beyond the French ver&s;e, in variety, &s;weetne&s;s, and melody. Mr. She|ridan has &s;hown, in his Lectures, that we abound more in vowel and diphthong &s;ounds, than mo&s;t Languages; and the&s;e too, &s;o di|vided into long and &s;hort, as to afford a pro|per diver&s;ity in the quantity of our &s;yllables. Our con&s;onants, he ob&s;erves, which appear &s;o crowded to the eye on paper, often form combinations not di&s;agreeable to the ear in pronouncing; and, in particular, the objec|tion which has been made to the frequent recurrence of the hi&s;&s;ing con&s;onant s in our Language, is unju&s;t and ill-founded. For, it has not been attended to, that very common|ly,
<PB N="210" REF="216">
and in the final &s;yllables e&s;pecially, this letter lo&s;es altogether the hi&s;&s;ing &s;ound, and is transformed into a <HI>z,</HI> which is one of the &s;ounds on which the ear re&s;ts with plea&s;ure; as in <HI>has, the&s;e, tho&s;e, loves, hears,</HI> and innu|merable more, where, though the letter s be retained in writing, it has really the power of <HI>z,</HI> not of the common s.</P>
<P>AFTER all, however, it mu&s;t be admitted, that &s;moothne&s;s, or beauty of &s;ound, is none of the di&s;tingui&s;hing properties of the Engli&s;h Tongue. Though not incapable of being formed into melodious arrangements, yet &s;trength and expre&s;&s;ivene&s;s, more than grace, form its character. We incline, in general, to a &s;hort pronunciation of our words, and have &s;hortened the quantity of mo&s;t of tho&s;e which we borrow from the Latin, as <HI>orator, &s;pectacle, theatre, liberty,</HI> and &s;uch like. A|greeable to this, is a remarkable peculiarity of Engli&s;h pronunciation, the throwing the accent farther back, that is, nearer the be|ginning of the word, than is done by any other nation. In Greek and Latin, no word is accented farther back than the third &s;ylla|ble from the end, or what is called the ante|penult. But, in Engli&s;h, we have many words accented on the fourth, &s;ome on the fifth &s;yllable from the end, as, <HI>m&ecirc;morable, con|v&ecirc;niency, &acirc;mbulatory, pr&ocirc;fitablene&s;s.</HI> The ge|neral effect of this practice of ha&s;tening the accent, or placing it &s;o near the beginning of a word, is to give a bri&s;k and a &s;pirited, but
<PB N="211" REF="217">
at the &s;ame time, a rapid and hurried, and not very mu&s;ical, tone to the whole pronun|ciation of a people.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h Tongue po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, undoubt|edly, this property, of being the mo&s;t &s;im|ple in its form and con&s;truction, of all the European dialects. It is free from all intricacy of ca&s;es, declen&s;ions, moods and ten&s;es. Its words are &s;ubject to fewer variations from their original form than tho&s;e of any other Language. Its &s;ub&s;tantives have no di&s;tinc|tion of gender, except what nature has made, and but one variation in ca&s;e. Its adjectives admit of no change at all, except what ex|pre&s;&s;es the degree of compari&s;on. Its verbs, in&s;tead of running through all the varieties of antient conjugation, &s;uffer no more than four or five changes in termination. By the help of a few prepo&s;itions and auxiliary verbs, all the purpo&s;es of &s;ignificancy in meaning are accompli&s;hed; while the words, for the mo&s;t part, pre&s;erve their form unchanged. The di&s;advantages in point of elegance, bre|vity, and force, which follow from this &s;truc|ture of our Language, I have before pointed out. But, at the &s;ame time, it mu&s;t be ad|mitted, that &s;uch a &s;tructure contributes to facility. It renders the acqui&s;ition of our Language le&s;s laborious, the arrangement of our words more plain and obvious, the rules of our &s;yntax fewer and more &s;imple.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="218">
I AGREE, indeed, with Dr. Lowth (pre|face to his Grammar), in thinking that this very &s;implicity and facility of our Language proves a cau&s;e of its being frequently writ|ten and &s;poken with le&s;s accuracy. It was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tudy Languages, which were of a more complex and artificial form, with greater care. The marks of gender and ca&s;e, the varieties of conjugation and declen&s;ion, the multiplied rules of &s;yntax, were all to be attended to in Speech. Hence Language be|came more an object of art. It was reduced into form; a &s;tandard was e&s;tabli&s;hed; and any departures from the &s;tandard became con&s;picuous. Whereas, among us, Language is hardly con&s;idered as an object of gramma|tical rule. We take it for granted, that a competent &s;kill in it may be acquired without any &s;tudy; and that, in a &s;yntax &s;o narrow and confined as ours, there is nothing which demands attention. Hence ari&s;es the habit of writing in a loo&s;e and inaccurate manner.</P>
<P>I ADMIT, that no grammatical rules have &s;ufficient authority to controul the firm and e&s;tabli&s;hed u&s;age of Language. E&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;tom in &s;peaking and writing, is the &s;tand|ard to which we mu&s;t at la&s;t re&s;ort for deter|mining every controverted point in Language and Style. But it will not follow from this, that grammatical rules are &s;uper&s;eded as u&s;ele&s;s. In every Language, which has been in any degree cultivated, there prevails a cer|tain
<PB N="213" REF="219">
&s;tructure and analogy of parts, which is under&s;tood to give foundation to the mo&s;t re|putable u&s;age of Speech; and which, in all ca&s;es, when u&s;age is loo&s;e or dubious, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es con&s;iderable authority. In every Lan|guage, there are rules of &s;yntax which mu&s;t be inviolably ob&s;erved by all who would ei|ther write or &s;peak with any propriety. For &s;yntax is no other than that arrangement of words, in a &s;entence, which renders the meaning of each word, and the relation of all the words to one another, mo&s;t clear and intelligible.</P>
<P>ALL the rules of Latin &s;yntax, it is true, cannot be applied to our Language. Many of tho&s;e rules aro&s;e from the particular form of their Language, which occa&s;ioned verbs or prepo&s;itions to govern, &s;ome the genitive, &s;ome the dative, &s;ome the accu&s;ative or abla|tive ca&s;e. But, ab&s;tracting from the&s;e pecu|liarities, it is to be always remembered, that the chief and fundamental rules of &s;yntax are common to the Engli&s;h as well as the La|tin Tongue; and, indeed, belong equally to all Languages. For, in all Languages, the parts which compo&s;e Speech are e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame; &s;ub&s;tantives, adjectives, verbs, and connecting particles: And wherever the&s;e parts of Speech are found, there are certain nece&s;&s;ary relations among them, which regu|late their &s;yntax, or the place which they ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s in a &s;entence. Thus, in En|gli&s;h,
<PB N="214" REF="220">
ju&s;t as much as in Latin, the adjective mu&s;t, by po&s;ition, be made to agree with its &s;ub&s;tantive; and the verb mu&s;t agree with its nominative in per&s;on and number; becau&s;e, from the nature of things, a word, which expre&s;&s;es either a quality or an action, mu&s;t corre&s;pond as clo&s;ely as po&s;&s;ible with the name of that thing who&s;e quality, or who&s;e action, it expre&s;&s;es. Two or more &s;ub&s;tan|tives, joined by a copulative, mu&s;t always require the verbs or pronouns, to which they refer, to be placed in the plural number; otherwi&s;e, their common relation to the&s;e verbs or pronouns is not pointed out. An active verb mu&s;t, in every Language, govern the accu&s;ative; that is, clearly point out &s;ome &s;ub&s;tantive noun, as the object to which its action is directed. A relative pronoun mu&s;t, in every form of Speech, agree with its an|tecedent in gender, number, and per&s;on; and conjunctions, or connecting particles, ought always to couple like ca&s;es and moods; that is, ought to join together words which are of the &s;ame form and &s;tate with each other. I mention the&s;e, as a few exempli|fications of that fundamental regard to &s;yn|tax, which, even in &s;uch a Language as ours, is ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite for writing or &s;peaking with any propriety.</P>
<P>WHATEVER the advantages, or defects of the Engli&s;h Language be, as it is our own Language, it de&s;erves a high degree of our
<PB N="215" REF="221">
&s;tudy and attention, both with regard to the choice of words which we employ, and with regard to the &s;yntax, or the arrangement of the&s;e words in a &s;entence. We know how much the Greeks and the Romans, in their mo&s;t poli&s;hed and flouri&s;hing times, cultivat|ed their own Tongues. We know how much &s;tudy both the French, and the Itali|ans, have be&s;towed upon theirs. Whatever knowledge may be acquired by the &s;tudy of other Languages, it can never be communi|cated with advantage, unle&s;s by &s;uch as can write and &s;peak their own Language well. Let the matter of an author be ever &s;o good and u&s;eful, his compo&s;itions will always &s;uf|fer in the public e&s;teem, if his expre&s;&s;ion be deficient in purity and propriety. At the &s;ame time, the attainment of a correct and elegant &s;tyle, is an object which demands application and labour. If any imagine they can catch it merely by the ear, or acquire it by a &s;light peru&s;al of &s;ome of our good authors, they will find them&s;elves much di&s;appointed. The many errors, even in point of grammer, the many offences again&s;t purity of Language, which are committed by writers who are far from being contemptible, demon&s;trate, that a careful &s;tudy of the Language is previou&s;ly requi&s;ite, in all who aim at writing it pro|perly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On this &s;ubject, the Reader ought to peru&s;e Dr. Lowth's Short Introduction to Engli&s;h Grammar, with Critical Notes; which is the grammatical performance of highe&s;t authority that

<HEAD>LECTURE X. STYLE&mdash;PERSPICUITY AND PRECISION.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING fini&s;hed the &s;ubject of Lan|guage, I now enter on the con&s;ideration of Style, and the rules that relate to it.</P>
<P>IT is not ea&s;y to give a preci&s;e idea of what is meant by Style. The be&s;t definition I can give of it, is, the peculiar manner in which a man expre&s;&s;es his conceptions, by means of Language. It is different from mere Language or words. The words, which an author employs, may be proper and fault|le&s;s; and his Style may, neverthele&s;s, have great faults; it may be dry, or &s;tiff, or fee|ble, or affected. Style has always &s;ome re|ference to an author's manner of thinking. It is a picture of the ideas which ri&s;e in his mind, and of the manner in which they ri&s;e there; and, hence, when we are examining an author's compo&s;ition, it is, in many ca&s;es,
<PB N="218" REF="224">
extremely difficult to &s;eparate the Style from the &s;entiment. No wonder the&s;e two &s;hould be &s;o intimately connected, as Style is no|thing el&s;e, than that &s;ort of expre&s;&s;ion which our thoughts mo&s;t readily a&s;&s;ume. Hence, different countries have been noted for pecu|liarities of Style, &s;uited to their different temper and genius. The ea&s;tern nations animated their Style with the mo&s;t &s;trong and hyperbolical figures. The Athenians, a po|li&s;hed and acute people, formed a Style ac|curate, clear, and neat. The A&s;iatics, gay and loo&s;e in their manners, affected a Style florid and diffu&s;e. The like &s;ort of charac|teri&s;tical differences are commonly remarked in the Style of the French, the Engli&s;h, and the Spaniards. In giving the general charac|ters of Style, it is u&s;ual to talk of a nervous, a feeble, or a &s;pirited Style; which are plain|ly the characters of a writer's manner of thinking, as well as of expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf: So difficult it is to &s;eparate the&s;e two things from one another. Of the general characters of Style, I am afterwards to di&s;cour&s;e; but it will be nece&s;&s;ary to begin with examining the more &s;imple qualities of it; from the a&s;|&s;emblage of which, its more complex deno|minations, in a great mea&s;ure, re&s;ult.</P>
<P>ALL the qualities of a good Style may be ranged under two heads, Per&s;picuity and Or|nament. For all that can po&s;&s;ibly be requir|ed of Language, is, to convey our ideas clearly to the minds of others, and, at the

<P>PERSPICUITY, it will be readily admitted, is the fundamental quality of Style<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Nobis prima &s;it virtus, per&s;picuitas, propria verba, rec|tus ordo, non in longum dilata conclu&s;io; nihil neque de&s;it, neque &s;uperfluat." <BIBL>QUINCTIL. lib. viii.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>; a qua|lity &s;o e&s;&s;ential in every kind of writing, that, for the want of it, nothing can atone.

<P>AUTHORS &s;ometimes plead the difficulty of their &s;ubject, as an excu&s;e for the want of Per&s;picuity. But the excu&s;e can rarely, if ever, be &s;u&s;tained. For whatever a man conceives clearly, that, it is in his power, if he will be at the trouble, to put into di&s;tinct propo&s;itions, or to expre&s;s clearly to others: and upon no &s;ubject ought any man to write, where he cannot think clearly. His ideas, indeed, may, very excu&s;ably, be on &s;ome &s;ubjects incomplete or inadequate; but &s;till, as far as they go, they ought to be clear; and, wherever this is the ca&s;e, Per&s;picuity, in expre&s;&s;ing them, is always attainable. The ob&s;curity which reigns &s;o much among many metaphy&s;ical writers, is, for the mo&s;t part, owing to the indi&s;tinctne&s;s of their own con|ceptions. They &s;ee the object but in a con|fu&s;ed light; and, of cour&s;e, can never exhi|bit it in a clear one to others.</P>
<P>PERSPICUITY in writing, is not to be con|&s;idered as only a &s;ort of negative virtue, or freedom from defect. It has higher merit: It is a degree of po&s;itive beauty. We are plea&s;ed with an author, we con&s;ider him as de&s;erving prai&s;e, who frees us from all fatigue
<PB N="221" REF="227">
of &s;earching for his meaning; who carries us through his &s;ubject without any embarra&s;&s;|ment or confu&s;ion; who&s;e &s;tyle flows always like a limpid &s;tream, where we &s;ee to the very bottom.</P>
<P>THE &s;tudy of Per&s;picuity requires atten|tion, fir&s;t, to &s;ingle words and phra&s;es, and then to the con&s;truction of &s;entences. I be|gin with treating of the fir&s;t, and &s;hall con|fine my&s;elf to it in this Lecture.</P>
<P>PERSPICUITY, con&s;idered with re&s;pect to words and phra&s;es, requires the&s;e three qua|lities in them; <HI>Purity, Propriety,</HI> and <HI>Preci|&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>PURITY and Propriety of Language, are often u&s;ed indi&s;criminately for each other; and, indeed, they are very nearly allied. A di&s;tinction, however, obtains between them. Purity, is the u&s;e of &s;uch words, and &s;uch con&s;tructions, as belong to the idiom of the Language which we &s;peak; in oppo&s;ition to words and phra&s;es that are imported from other Languages, or that are ob&s;olete, or new coined, or u&s;ed without proper autho|rity. Propriety, is the &s;election of &s;uch words in the Language, as the be&s;t and mo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed u&s;age has appropriated to tho&s;e ideas which we intend to expre&s;s by them. It implies the correct and happy application of them, according to that u&s;age, in oppo&s;ition
<PB N="222" REF="228">
to vulgari&s;ms, or low expre&s;&s;ions; and to words and phra&s;es, which would be le&s;s &s;ig|nificant of the ideas that we mean to convey. Style may be pure, that is, it may all be &s;trict|ly Engli&s;h, without Scottici&s;ms or Galli|ci&s;ms, or ungrammatical irregular expre&s;&s;ions of any kind, and may, neverthele&s;s, be defi|cient in Propriety. The words may be ill cho&s;en; not adapted to the &s;ubject, nor fully expre&s;&s;ive of the author's &s;en&s;e. He has taken all his words and phra&s;es from the ge|neral ma&s;s of Engli&s;h Language; but he has made his &s;election among the&s;e words unhap|pily. Whereas, Style cannot be proper with|out being al&s;o pure; and where both Purity and Propriety meet, be&s;ides making Style per&s;picuous, they al&s;o render it graceful. There is no &s;tandard, either of Purity or of Propriety, but the practice of the be&s;t writers and &s;peakers in the country.</P>
<P>WHEN I mentioned ob&s;olete or new-coin|ed words as incongruous with Purity of Style, it will be ea&s;ily under&s;tood, that &s;ome excep|tions are to be made. On certain occa&s;ions, they may have grace. Poetry admits of greater latitude than pro&s;e, with re&s;pect to coining, or, at lea&s;t, new-compounding words; yet, even here, this liberty &s;hould be u&s;ed with a &s;paring hand. In pro&s;e, &s;uch innovations are more hazardous, and have a wor&s;e effect. They are apt to give Style an affected and conceited air; and &s;hould never
<PB N="223" REF="229">
be ventured upon, except by &s;uch, who&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed reputation gives them &s;ome degree of dictatorial power over Language.</P>
<P>THE introduction of foreign and learned words, unle&s;s where nece&s;&s;ity requires them, &s;hould always be avoided. Barren Lan|guages may need &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tances; but ours is not one of the&s;e. Dean Swift, one of our mo&s;t correct writers, valued him&s;elf much on u&s;ing no words but &s;uch as were of native growth: and his Language may, indeed, be con&s;idered as a &s;tandard of the &s;tricte&s;t Pu|rity and Propriety in the choice of words. At pre&s;ent, we &s;eem to be departing from this &s;tandard. A multitude of Latin words have, of late, been poured in upon us. On &s;ome occa&s;ions, they give an appearance of elevation and dignity to Style. But often al&s;o, they render it &s;tiff and forced: And, in general, a plain native Style, as it is more intelligible to all readers, &s;o, by a proper ma|nagement of words, it can be made equally &s;trong and expre&s;&s;ive with this Latini&s;ed Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>LET us now con&s;ider the import of Pre|ci&s;ion in Language, which, as it is the high|e&s;t part of the quality denoted by Per&s;pi|cuity, merits a full explication; and the more, becau&s;e di&s;tinct ideas are, perhaps, not com|monly formed about it.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="230">
THE exact import of Preci&s;ion may be drawn from the etymology of the word. It comes from <Q REND="inline">"precidere,"</Q> to cut off: It im|ports retrenching all &s;uperfluities, and prun|ing the expre&s;&s;ion &s;o, as to exhibit neither more nor le&s;s than an exact copy of his idea who u&s;es it. I ob&s;erved before, that it is often difficult to &s;eparate the qualities of Style from the qualities of Thought; and it is found &s;o in this in&s;tance. For, in order to write with Preci&s;ion, though this be properly a quality of Style, one mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s a very con&s;iderable degree of di&s;tinctne&s;s and accu|racy in his manner of thinking.</P>
<P>THE words, which a man u&s;es to expre&s;s his ideas, may be faulty in three re&s;pects: They may either not expre&s;s that idea which the author intends, but &s;ome other which only re&s;embles, or is akin to it; or, they may expre&s;s that idea, but not quite fully and completely; or, they may expre&s;s it, to|gether with &s;omething more than he intends. Preci&s;ion &s;tands oppo&s;ed to all the&s;e three faults; but chiefly to the la&s;t. In an author's writing with Propriety, his being free of the two former faults &s;eems implied. The words which he u&s;es are proper; that is, they ex|pre&s;s that idea which he intends, and they expre&s;s it fully; but to be Preci&s;e, &s;ignifies, that they expre&s;s that idea, and no more. There is nothing in his words which intro|duces any foreign idea, any &s;uperfluous un|&s;ea&s;onable acce&s;&s;ory, &s;o as to mix it con|fu&s;edly
<PB N="225" REF="231">
with the principal object, and there|by to render our conception of that object loo&s;e and indi&s;tinct. This requires a writer to have, him&s;elf, a very clear apprehen&s;ion of the object he means to pre&s;ent to us; to have laid fa&s;t hold of it in his mind; and never to waver in any one view he takes of it: a perfection to which, indeed, few wri|ters attain.</P>
<P>THE u&s;e and importance of Preci&s;ion, may be deduced from the nature of the human mind. It never can view, clearly and di|&s;tinctly, above one object at a time. If it mu&s;t look at two or three together, e&s;pecially objects among which there is re&s;emblance or connection, it finds it&s;elf confu&s;ed and em|barra&s;&s;ed. It cannot clearly perceive in what they agree, and in what they differ. Thus, were any object, &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome animal, to be pre&s;ented to me, of who&s;e &s;tructure I wanted to form a di&s;tinct notion, I would de&s;ire all its trappings to be taken off, I would require it to be brought before me by it&s;elf, and to &s;tand alone, that there might be nothing to di&s;tract my attention. The &s;ame is the ca&s;e with words. If, when you would inform me of your meaning, you al&s;o tell me more than what conveys it; if you join foreign circum|&s;tances to the principal object; if, by unne|ce&s;&s;arily varying the expre&s;&s;ion, you &s;hift the point of view, and make me &s;ee &s;ometimes the object it&s;elf, and &s;ometimes another thing that is connected with it; you thereby oblige
<PB N="226" REF="232">
me to look on &s;everal objects at once, and I lo&s;e &s;ight of the principal. You load the animal, you are &s;howing me, with &s;o many trappings and collars, and bring &s;o many of the &s;ame &s;pecies before me, &s;omewhat re|&s;embling, and yet &s;omewhat differing, that I &s;ee none of them clearly.</P>
<P>This forms what is called a Loo&s;e Style; and is the proper oppo&s;ite to Preci&s;ion. It generally ari&s;es from u&s;ing a &s;uperfluity of words. Feeble writers employ a multitude of words to make them&s;elves under&s;tood, as they think, more di&s;tinctly; and they only confound the reader. They are &s;en&s;ible of not having caught the preci&s;e expre&s;&s;ion, to convey what they would &s;ignify; they do not, indeed, conceive their own meaning very preci&s;ely them&s;elves; and, therefore, help it out, as they can, by this and the other word, which may, as they &s;uppo&s;e, &s;upply the defect, and bring you &s;omewhat nearer to their idea: They are always going about it, and about it, but never ju&s;t hit the thing. The image as they &s;et it before you, is al|ways &s;een double; and no double image is di&s;tinct. When an author tells me of his he|ro's <HI>courage</HI> in the day of battle, the expre&s;|&s;ion is preci&s;e, and I under&s;tand it fully. But if, from the de&s;ire of multiplying words, he will needs prai&s;e his <HI>courage</HI> and <HI>fortitude;</HI> at the moment he joins the&s;e words together, my idea begins to waver. He means to ex|pre&s;s one quality more &s;trongly; but he is, in
<PB N="227" REF="233">
truth, expre&s;&s;ing two. <HI>Courage</HI> re&s;i&s;ts dan|ger; <HI>fortitude</HI> &s;upports pain. The occa&s;ion of exerting each of the&s;e qualities is differ|ent; and being led to think of both together, when only one of them &s;hould be in my view, my view is rendered un&s;teady, and my conception of the object indi&s;tinct.</P>
<P>FROM what I have &s;aid, it appears that an author may, in a qualified &s;en&s;e, be per&s;pi|cuous, while yet he is far from being preci&s;e. He u&s;es proper words, and proper arrange|ment; he gives you the idea as clear as he conceives it him&s;elf; and &s;o far he is per&s;pi|cuous: but the ideas are not very clear in his own mind; they are loo&s;e and general; and, therefore, cannot be expre&s;&s;ed with Preci&s;ion. All &s;ubjects do not equally require Preci&s;ion. It is &s;ufficient, on many occa&s;ions, that we have a general view of the meaning. The &s;ubject, perhaps, is of the known and fami|liar kind; and we are in no hazard of mi&s;|taking the &s;en&s;e of the author, though every word which he u&s;es be not preci&s;e and exact.</P>
<P>FEW authors, for in&s;tance, in the Engli&s;h Language, are more clear and per&s;picuous, on the whole, than Archbi&s;hop Tillot&s;on, and Sir William Temple; yet neither of them are remarkable for Preci&s;ion. They are loo&s;e and diffu&s;e; and accu&s;tomed to ex|pre&s;s their meaning by &s;everal words, which &s;hew you fully whereabouts it lies, rather than to &s;ingle out tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, which
<PB N="228" REF="234">
would convey clearly the idea they have in view, and no more. Neither, indeed, is Preci&s;ion the prevailing character of Mr. Ad|di&s;on's Style; although he is not &s;o deficient in this re&s;pect as the other two authors.</P>
<P>LORD SHAFTSBURY'S faults, in point of Preci&s;ion, are much greater than Mr. Addi|&s;on's; and the more unpardonable, becau&s;e he is a profe&s;&s;ed philo&s;ophical writer; who, as &s;uch, ought, above all things, to have &s;tu|died Preci&s;ion. His Style has both great beauties, and great faults; and, on the whole, is by no means a &s;afe model for imitation. Lord Shaft&s;bury was well acquainted with the power of words; tho&s;e which he employs are generally proper and well &s;ounding; he has great variety of them; and his arrange|ment, as &s;hall be afterwards &s;hown, is com|monly beautiful. His defect, in Preci&s;ion, is not owing &s;o much to indi&s;tinct or confu&s;ed ideas, as to perpetual affectation. He is fond, to exce&s;s, of the pomp and parade of Language; he is never &s;atisfied with expre&s;|&s;ing any thing clearly and &s;imply; he mu&s;t always give it the dre&s;s of &s;tate and maje&s;ty. Hence perpetual circumlocutions, and many words and phra&s;es employed to de&s;cribe &s;ome|what, that would have been de&s;cribed much better by one of them. If he has occa&s;ion to mention any per&s;on or author, he very rarely mentions him by his proper name. In the treati&s;e, entitled, Advice to an Author, he de&s;cants for two or three pages together
<PB N="229" REF="235">
upon Ari&s;totle, without once naming him in any other way, than the Ma&s;ter Critic, the Mighty Genius and Judge of Art, the Prince of Critics, the Grand Ma&s;ter of Art, and Con&s;ummate Philologi&s;t. In the &s;ame way, the Grand Poetic Sire, the Philo&s;ophical Pa|triarch, and his Di&s;ciple of Noble Birth, and lofty Genius, are the only names by which he conde&s;cends to di&s;tingui&s;h Homer, So|crates, and Plato, in another pa&s;&s;age of the &s;ame treati&s;e. This method of di&s;tingui&s;h|ing per&s;ons is extremely affected; but it is not &s;o contrary to Preci&s;ion, as the frequent circumlocutions he employs for all moral ideas; attentive, on every occa&s;ion, more to the pomp of Language, than to the clear|ne&s;s which he ought to have &s;tudied as a philo&s;opher. The moral &s;en&s;e, for in&s;tance, after he had once defined it, was a clear term; but, how vague becomes the idea, when, in the next page, he calls it, <Q REND="inline">"That natural affection, and anticipating fancy, which makes the &s;en&s;e of right and wrong?"</Q> Self examination, or reflection on our own conduct, is an idea conceived with ea&s;e; but when it is wrought into all the forms of, <Q REND="inline">"A man's dividing him&s;elf into two parties, becoming a &s;elf-dialogi&s;t, entering into part|ner&s;hip with him&s;elf, forming the dual number practically within him&s;elf;"</Q> we hardly know what to make of it. On &s;ome occa&s;ions, he &s;o adorns, or rather loads with words, the plaine&s;t and &s;imple&s;t propo&s;itions,
<PB N="230" REF="236">
as, if not to ob&s;cure, at lea&s;t, to enfeeble them.</P>
<P>IN the following paragraph, for example, of the Inquiry concerning Virtue, he means to &s;how, that, by every ill action we hurt our mind, as much as one who &s;hould &s;wallow poi&s;on, or give him&s;elf a wound, would hurt his body. Ob&s;erve what a redundancy of words he pours forth: <Q REND="inline">"Now, if the fabrick of the mind or temper appeared to us, &s;uch as it really is; if we &s;aw it impo&s;&s;ible to remove hence any one good or orderly af|fection, or to introduce any ill or di&s;orderly one, without drawing on, in &s;ome degree, that di&s;&s;olute &s;tate which, at its height, is confe&s;&s;ed to be &s;o mi&s;erable; it would then, undoubtedly, be confe&s;&s;ed, that &s;ince no ill, immoral, or unju&s;t action, can be com|mitted, without either a new inroad and breach on the temper and pa&s;&s;ions, or a further advancing of that execution already done; whoever did ill, or acted in preju|dice of his integrity, good-nature, or worth, would of nece&s;&s;ity, act with greater cru|elty towards him&s;elf, than he who &s;crupled not to &s;wallow what was poi&s;onous, or who, with his own hands, &s;hould voluntarily mangle or wound his outward form or con|&s;titution, natural limbs or body<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Characteri&s;t.

This &s;ort of Style is ele|gantly de&s;cribed by Quinctilian, <Q REND="inline">"E&s;t in qui|bu&s;dam turba inanium verborum, qui dum communem loquendi morem reformidant, ducti &s;pecie nitoris, circumeunt omnia co|pio&s;a loquacitate quae dicere volunt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"A crowd of unmeaning words is brought together, by &s;ome authors, who, afraid of expre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves after a common and ordinary manner, and allured by an appear|ance of &s;plendour, &s;urround every thing which they mean to &s;ay with a certain copious loquacity."</Q></NOTE>." <BIBL>Lib. vii. cap. 2.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>THE great &s;ource of a loo&s;e Style, in op|po&s;ition to Preci&s;ion, is the injudicious u&s;e of tho&s;e words termed Synonymous. They are called Synonymous, becau&s;e they agree in expre&s;&s;ing one principal idea; but, for the mo&s;t part, if not always, they expre&s;s it with &s;ome diver&s;ity in the circum&s;tances. They are varied by &s;ome acce&s;&s;ory idea which eve|ry word introduces, and which forms the di&s;tinction between them. Hardly, in any
<PB N="232" REF="238">
Language, are there two words that convey preci&s;ely the &s;ame idea; a per&s;on thoroughly conver&s;ant in the propriety of the Language, will always be able to ob&s;erve &s;omething that di&s;tingui&s;hes them. As they are like different &s;hades of the &s;ame colour, an ac|curate writer can employ them to great ad|vantage, by u&s;ing them, &s;o as to heighten and to fini&s;h the picture which he gives us. He &s;upplies by one, what was wanting in the other, to the force, or to the lu&s;tre of the image which he means to exhibit. But, in order to this end, he mu&s;t be extremely at|tentive to the choice which he makes of them. For the bulk of writers are very apt to confound them with each other; and to employ them carele&s;sly, merely for the &s;ake of filling up a period, or of rounding and di|ver&s;ifying the Language, as if their &s;ignifica|tion were exactly the &s;ame, while, in truth, it is not. Hence a certain mi&s;t, and indi&s;|tinctne&s;s, is unwarily thrown over Style.</P>
<P>IN the Latin Language, there are no two words we would more readily take to be &s;y|nonymous, than <HI>amare</HI> and <HI>diligere.</HI> Cicero, however, has &s;hewn us, that there is a very clear di&s;tinction betwixt them, <Q REND="inline">"Quid ergo,"</Q> &s;ays he, in one of his epi&s;tles, <Q REND="inline">"tibi com|mendem eum quem tu ip&s;e diligis?

<PB N="233" REF="239">
<HI>&s;ecurus,</HI> are words which we would readily confound; yet their meaning is different. <HI>Tutus,</HI> &s;ignifies out of danger; <HI>&s;ecurus,</HI> free from the dread of it.

<P><HI>Pride, Vanity.</HI> Pride, makes us e&s;teem our&s;elves; Vanity, makes us de&s;ire the e&s;teem of others. It is ju&s;t to &s;ay, as Dean Swift has done, that a man is too proud to be vain.</P>

<HI>To di&s;tingui&s;h, to &s;eparate.</HI> We di&s;tingui&s;h, what we want not to confound with another thing; we &s;eparate, what we want to re|move from it. Objects are di&s;tingui&s;hed from one another, by their qualities. They are &s;eparated, by the di&s;tance of time or place.</P>
<P><HI>To weary, to fatigue.</HI> The continuance of the &s;ame thing wearies us; labour fatigues us. I am weary with &s;tanding; I am fatigued with walking. A &s;uitor wearies us by his per|&s;everance; fatigues us by his importunity.</P>
<P><HI>To abhor, to dete&s;t.</HI> To abhor, imports, &s;imply, &s;trong di&s;like; to dete&s;t, imports al&s;o &s;trong di&s;approbation. One abhors being in debt; he dete&s;ts treachery.</P>

<P><HI>Only, alone.</HI> Only, imports that there is no other of the &s;ame kind; alone, imports being accompanied by no other. An only child, is one who has neither brother nor &s;i&s;ter; a child alone, is one who is left by it|&s;elf. There is a difference, therefore, in pre|ci&s;e Language, betwixt the&s;e two phra&s;es, <Q REND="inline">"Virtue only makes us happy;"</Q> and, <Q REND="inline">"Vir|tue alone makes us happy."</Q> Virtue only makes us happy, imports, that nothing el&s;e

<P><HI>Entire, Complete.</HI> A thing is entire, by wanting none of its parts; complete, by wanting none of the appendages that belong to it. A man may have an entire hou&s;e to him&s;elf; and yet not have one complete apartment.</P>
<P><HI>Tranquillity, Peace, Calm.</HI> Tranquillity, re&s;pects a &s;ituation free from trouble, con&s;i|dered in it&s;elf; Peace, the &s;ame &s;ituation with re&s;pect to any cau&s;es that might inter|rupt it; Calm, with regard to a di&s;turbed &s;ituation going before, or following it.

<P><HI>A Difficulty, an Ob&s;tacle.</HI> A Difficulty, embarra&s;&s;es; an Ob&s;tacle, &s;tops us. We re|move the one; we &s;urmount the other.

<HI>Wi&s;dom, Prudence,</HI> Wi&s;dom, leads us to &s;peak and act what is mo&s;t proper. Pru|dence, prevents our &s;peaking or acting im|properly. A wi&s;e man, employs the mo&s;t proper means for &s;ucce&s;s; a prudent man, the &s;afe&s;t means for not being brought into danger.</P>
<P><HI>Enough, Sufficient.</HI> Enough, relates to the quantity which one wi&s;hes to have of any thing. Sufficient, relates to the u&s;e that is to be made of it. Hence, Enough, general|ly imports a greater quantity than Sufficient does. The covetous man never has enough; although he has what is &s;ufficient for nature.</P>
<P><HI>To avow, to acknowledge, to confe&s;s.</HI> Each of the&s;e words imports the affirmation of a fact, but in very different circum&s;tances. To avow, &s;uppo&s;es the per&s;on to glory in it; to acknowledge, &s;uppo&s;es a &s;mall degree of faultine&s;s, which the acknowledgment com|pen&s;ates; to confe&s;s, &s;uppo&s;es a higher de|gree of crime. A patriot avows his oppo&s;i|tion to a bad mini&s;ter, and is applauded; a gentleman acknowledges his mi&s;take, and is forgiven; a pri&s;oner confe&s;&s;es the crime he is accu&s;ed of, and is puni&s;hed.</P>
<P><HI>To remark, to ob&s;erve.</HI> We remark, in the way of attention, in order to remember; we ob&s;erve, in the way of examination, in or|der to judge. A traveller remarks the mo&s;t

An Ambiguous Expre&s;&s;ion is, one which has apparently two &s;en&s;es, and leaves us at a lo&s;s which of them to give it. An equivocal expre&s;&s;ion is u&s;ed with an in|tention to deceive; an ambiguous one, when it is u&s;ed with de&s;ign, is, with an intention not to give full information. An hone&s;t man will never employ an equivocal expre&s;|&s;ion; a confu&s;ed man may often utter ambi|guous ones, without any de&s;ign. I &s;hall give only one in&s;tance more.</P>
<P><HI>With, By.</HI> Both the&s;e particles expre&s;s the connection between &s;ome in&s;trument, or means of effecting an end, and the agent who employs it: but <HI>with,</HI> expre&s;&s;es a more clo&s;e and immediate connection; <HI>by,</HI> a more remote one. We kill a man <HI>with</HI> a &s;word; he dies <HI>by</HI> violence. The criminal is bound <HI>with</HI> ropes <HI>by</HI> the executioner. The proper di&s;tinction in the u&s;e of the&s;e particles, is elegantly marked in a pa&s;&s;age of Dr. Robert|&s;on's Hi&s;tory of Scotland. When one of the old Scotti&s;h kings was making an enquiry in|to the tenure <HI>by</HI> which his nobles held their lands, they &s;tarted up, and drew their &s;words: <Q REND="inline">"<HI>By</HI> the&s;e,"</Q> &s;aid they, <Q REND="inline">"we acquired our

lands, and <HI>with</HI> the&s;e, we will defend them."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"<HI>By</HI> the&s;e we acquired our lands;"</Q> &s;ignifies the more remote means of acqui&s;ition by force and martial deeds; and, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>with</HI> the&s;e we will defend them;"</Q> &s;ignifies the imme|diate direct in&s;trument, the &s;word, which they would employ in their defence.</P>
<P>THESE are in&s;tances of words, in our Language, which, by carele&s;s writers, are apt to be employed as perfectly &s;ynonymous, and yet are not &s;o. Their &s;ignifications ap|proach, but are not preci&s;ely the &s;ame. The more the di&s;tinction in the meaning of &s;uch words is weighed, and attended to, the more clearly and forcibly &s;hall we &s;peak or write<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In French, there is a very u&s;eful treati&s;e on this &s;ubject, the Abb&eacute; Girard's <HI>Synonymes Fran&ccedil;oi&s;es,</HI> in which he has made a large collection of &s;uch apparent Synonymes in the Language, and &s;hown, with much accuracy, the difference in their &s;ignification. It were much to be wi&s;hed, that &s;ome &s;uch work were undertaken for our tongue, and executed with equal ta&s;te and judgment. Nothing would contribute more to preci&s;e and elegant writing. In the mean time, this French Treati&s;e may be peru&s;ed with con&s;iderable profit. It will ac|cu&s;tom per&s;ons to weigh, with attention, the force of words; and will &s;ugge&s;t &s;everal di&s;tinctions betwixt &s;ynonymous terms in our own language, analogous to tho&s;e which he has pointed out in the French; and, accordingly, &s;everal of the in&s;tances above given were &s;ugge&s;ted by the work of this author.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FROM all that has been &s;aid on this head, it will now appear, that, in order to write or &s;peak with Preci&s;ion, two things are e&s;peci|ally requi&s;ite; one, that an author's own ideas be clear and di&s;tinct; and the other, that he have an exact and full comprehen|&s;ion
<PB N="240" REF="246">
of the force of tho&s;e words which he employs. Natural genius is here required; labour and attention &s;till more. Dean Swift is one of the authors, in our Language, mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for Preci&s;ion of Style. In his writings, we &s;eldom or never find vague ex|pre&s;&s;ions, and &s;ynonymous words, carele&s;ly thrown together. His meaning is always clear, and &s;trongly marked.</P>
<P>I HAD occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve before, that though all &s;ubjects of writing or di&s;cour&s;e demand Per&s;picuity, yet all do not require the &s;ame degree of that exact Preci&s;ion, which I have endeavoured to explain. It is, indeed, in every &s;ort of writing, a great beauty to have, at lea&s;t, &s;ome mea&s;ure of Preci&s;ion, in di&s;tinction from that loo&s;e profu&s;ion of words which imprints no clear idea on the reader's mind. But we mu&s;t, at the &s;ame time, be on our guard, le&s;t too great a &s;tudy of Pre|ci&s;ion, e&s;pecially in &s;ubjects where it is not &s;trictly requi&s;ite, betray us into a dry and barren Style; le&s;t, from the de&s;ire of prun|ing too clo&s;ely, we retrench all copiou&s;ne&s;s and ornament. Some degree of this failing may, perhaps, be remarked in Dean Swift's &s;erious works. Attentive only to exhibit his ideas clear and exact, re&s;ting wholly on his &s;en&s;e and di&s;tinctne&s;s, he appears to reject, di&s;dainfully, all embelli&s;hment which, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, may be thought to render his manner &s;omewhat hard and dry. To unite together Copiou&s;ne&s;s and Preci&s;ion, to
<PB N="241" REF="247">
be flowing and graceful, and, at the &s;ame time, correct and exact in the choice of every word, is, no doubt, one of the highe&s;t and mo&s;t difficult attainments in writing. Some kinds of compo&s;ition may require more of Copiou&s;ne&s;s and Ornament; others, more of Preci&s;ion and Accuracy; nay, in the &s;ame compo&s;ition, the different parts of it may de|mand a proper variation of manner. But we mu&s;t &s;tudy never to &s;acrifice, totally, any one of the&s;e qualities to the other; and, by a proper management, both of them may be made fully con&s;i&s;tent, if our own ideas be preci&s;e, and our knowledge and &s;tock of words be, at the &s;ame time, exten&s;ive.</P>

<HEAD>LECTURE XI. STRUCTURE OF SENTENCES.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING begun to treat of Style, in the la&s;t Lecture I con&s;idered its fundamen|tal quality, Per&s;picuity. What I have &s;aid of this, relates chiefly to the choice of Words. From words I proceed to Sentences; and as, in all writing and di&s;cour&s;e, the proper com|po&s;ition and &s;tructure of Sentences is of the highe&s;t importance, I &s;hall treat of this fully. Though Per&s;picuity be the general head un|der which I, at pre&s;ent, con&s;ider Language, I &s;hall not confine my&s;elf to this quality alone, in Sentences, but &s;hall enquire al&s;o, what is requi&s;ite for their Grace and Beau|ty: that I may bring together, under one view, all that &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to be attended to in the con&s;truction and arrangement of words in a Sentence.</P>
<P>IT is not ea&s;y to give an exact definition of a Sentence, or Period, farther, than as it
<PB N="243" REF="249">
always implies &s;ome one complete propo&s;ition or enunciation of thought. Ari&s;totle's defi|nition is, in the main, a good one: <Q REND="inline">"<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">:"</Q>  <Q REND="inline">"A form of Speech which hath a beginning and an end within it&s;elf, and is of &s;uch a length as to be ea&s;ily comprehended at once."</Q> This, however, admits of great latitude. For a Sentence, or Period, con&s;i&s;ts always of component parts, which are called its mem|bers; and as the&s;e members may be either few or many, and may be connected in &s;eve|ral different ways, the &s;ame thought, or men|tal propo&s;ition, may often be either brought into one Sentence, or &s;plit into two or three, without the material breach of any rule.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t variety that occurs in the con&s;i|deration of Sentences, is, the di&s;tinction of long and &s;hort ones. The preci&s;e length of Sentences, as to the number of words, or the number of members, which may enter into them, cannot be a&s;certained by any definite mea&s;ure. Only, it is obvious, there may be an extreme on either &s;ide. Sentences, im|moderately long, and con&s;i&s;ting of too many members, always tran&s;gre&s;s &s;ome one or other of the rules which I &s;hall mention &s;oon, as nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved in every good Sen|tence. In di&s;cour&s;es that are to be &s;poken, regard mu&s;t be had to the ea&s;ine&s;s of pronun|ciation, which is not con&s;i&s;tent with too long periods. In compo&s;itions where pronuncia|tion has no place, &s;till, however, by u&s;ing
<PB N="244" REF="250">
long periods too frequently, an author over|loads the reader's ear, and fatigues his at|tention. For long Periods require, evident|ly, more attention than &s;hort ones, in order to perceive clearly the connexion of the &s;e|veral parts, and to take in the whole at one view. At the &s;ame time, there may be an exce&s;s in too many &s;hort Sentences al&s;o; by which the &s;en&s;e is &s;plit and broken, the con|nexion of thought weakened, and the me|mory burdened, by pre&s;enting to it a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of minute objects.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the length and con&s;tructi|on of Sentences, the French critics make a very ju&s;t di&s;tinction of Style, into <HI>Style Pe|riodique,</HI> and <HI>Style Coup&eacute;.</HI> The <HI>Style Periodi|que</HI> is, where the &s;entences are compo&s;ed of &s;everal members linked together, and hang|ing upon one another, &s;o that the &s;en&s;e of the whole is not brought out till the clo&s;e. This is the mo&s;t pompous, mu&s;ical, and ora|torical manner of compo&s;ing; as in the fol|lowing &s;entence of Sir William Temple: <Q REND="inline">"If you look about you, and con&s;ider the lives of others as well as your own; if you think how few are born with honour, and how many die without name or children; how little beauty we &s;ee, and how few friends we hear of; how many di&s;ea&s;es, and how much poverty there is in the world; you will fall down upon your knees, and, in&s;tead of repining at one affliction, will admire &s;o many ble&s;&s;ings which you have
<PB N="245" REF="251">
received from the hand of God." <BIBL>(Letter to Lady E&s;&s;ex.)</BIBL></Q> Cicero abounds with Sen|tences con&s;tructed after this manner.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Style Coup&eacute;</HI> is, where the &s;en&s;e is form|ed into &s;hort independent propo&s;itions, each complete within it&s;elf; as in the following of Mr. Pope: <Q REND="inline">"I confe&s;s, it was want of con|&s;ideration that made me an author. I writ, becau&s;e it amu&s;ed me. I corrected, becau&s;e it was as plea&s;ant to me to correct as to write. I publi&s;hed, becau&s;e, I was told, I might plea&s;e &s;uch as it was a credit to plea&s;e." <BIBL>(Preface to his works.)</BIBL></Q>  This is very much the French method of writing; and always &s;uits gay and ea&s;y &s;ubjects. The <HI>Style Periodique,</HI> gives an air of gravity and dignity to compo&s;ition. The <HI>Style Coup&eacute;,</HI> is more lively and &s;triking. According to the nature of the compo&s;ition, therefore, and the general character it ought to bear, the one or other may be predominant. But, in almo&s;t every kind of compo&s;ition, the great rule is to intermix them. For the ear tires of either of them when too long continued: Whereas, by a proper mixture of long and &s;hort Periods, the ear is gratified, and a cer|tain &s;prightline&s;s is joined with maje&s;ty in our &s;tyle. <Q REND="inline">"Non &s;emper,"</Q> &s;ays Cicero (de|&s;cribing very expre&s;&s;ively, the&s;e two differ|ent kinds of Styles, of which I have been &s;peaking,) <Q REND="inline">"non &s;emper utendum e&s;t perpe|tuitate, &amp; qua&s;i conver&s;ione verborum;

<P>THIS variety is of &s;o great con&s;equence, that it mu&s;t be &s;tudied, not only in the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of long and &s;hort Sentences, but in the &s;tructure of our Sentences al&s;o. A train of Sentences, con&s;tructed in the &s;ame man|ner, and with the &s;ame number of members, whether long or &s;hort, &s;hould never be al|lowed to &s;ucceed one another. However mu&s;ical each of them may be, it has a bet|ter effect to introduce even a di&s;cord, than to cloy the ear with the repetition of &s;imilar &s;ounds: For, nothing is &s;o tire&s;ome as per|petual uniformity. In this article of the con&s;truction and di&s;tribution of his Sentences, Lord Shaft&s;bury has &s;hown great art. In the la&s;t Lecture, I ob&s;erved, that he is often guil|ty of &s;acrificing preci&s;ion of &s;tyle to pomp of expre&s;&s;ion; and that there runs through his whole manner, a &s;tiffne&s;s and affectation, which render him very unfit to be con&s;idered as a general model. But, as his ear was fine, and as he was extremely attentive to every thing that is elegant, he has &s;tudied the pro|per intermixture of long and &s;hort Sentences, with variety and harmony in their &s;tructure, more than any other Engli&s;h author; and for this part of compo&s;ition he de&s;erves at|tention.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="253">
FROM the&s;e general ob&s;ervations, let us now de&s;cend to a more particular con&s;idera|tion of the qualities that are required to make a Sentence perfect. So much depends upon the proper con&s;truction of Sentences, that, in every &s;ort of compo&s;ition, we cannot be too &s;trict in our attentions to it. For, be the &s;ubject what it will, if the Sentences be con|&s;tructed in a clum&s;y, perplexed, or feeble manner, it is impo&s;&s;ible that a work, com|po&s;ed of &s;uch Sentences, can be read with plea&s;ure, or even with profit. Whereas, by giving attention to the rules which relate to this part of &s;tyle, we acquire the habit of ex|pre&s;&s;ing our&s;elves with Per&s;picuity and Ele|gance; and, if a di&s;order chance to ari&s;e in &s;ome of our Sentences, we immediately &s;ee where it lies, and are able to rectify it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the Structure of Sentences, the Antients appear to have be&s;towed a great deal of attention and care. The Trea|ti&s;e of Demetrius Phalereus, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, abounds with ob|&s;ervations upon the choice and collocation of words carried to &s;uch a degree of nicety, as would frequently &s;eem to us mi|nute. The Treati&s;e of Diony&s;ius of Halicarna&s;&s;us, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, is more ma&s;terly; but is chiefly confined to the mu&s;ical &s;tructure of Periods; a &s;ubject, for which the Greek Language afforded much more a&s;&s;i&s;tance to their writers, than our Tongue admits. On the arrangement of words, in Engli&s;h Sentences, the xviiith chapter of Lord Kaim's Elements of Critici&s;m ought to be con&s;ulted; and al&s;o, the 2d Volume of Dr. Campbell's Philo&s;ophy of Rhetoric.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE properties mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to a perfect Sentence, &s;eem to me, the four following: 1. Clearne&s;s and Preci&s;ion. 2. Unity. 3. Strength. 4. Harmony. Each of the&s;e I &s;hall illu&s;trate &s;eparately, and at &s;ome length.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="254">
THE fir&s;t is, Clearne&s;s and Preci&s;ion. The lea&s;t failure here, the lea&s;t degree of ambi|guity, which leaves the mind in any &s;ort of &s;u&s;pence as to the meaning, ought to be avoided with the greate&s;t care; nor is it &s;o ea&s;y a matter to keep always clear of this, as one might, at fir&s;t, imagine. Ambiguity ari&s;es from two cau&s;es: either from a wrong choice of words, or a wrong collocation of them. Of the choice of words, as far as re|gards Per&s;picuity, I treated fully in the la&s;t Lecture. Of the collocation of them, I am now to treat. The fir&s;t thing to be &s;tudied here, is, to ob&s;erve exactly the rules of gram|mar, as far as the&s;e can guide us. But as the grammar of our Language is not exten|&s;ive, there may often be an ambiguous col|location of words, where there is no tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion of any grammatical rule. The re|lations which the words, or members of a period, bear to one another, cannot be point|ed out in Engli&s;h, as in the Greek or Latin, by means of termination; it is a&s;certained only by the po&s;ition in which they &s;tand. Hence a capital rule in the arrangement of Sentences is, that the words or members mo&s;t nearly related, &s;hould be placed in the Sen|tence, as near to each other as po&s;&s;ible; &s;o as to make their mutual relation clearly ap|pear. This is a rule not always ob&s;erved, even by good writers, as &s;trictly as it ought to be. It will be nece&s;&s;ary to produce &s;ome in&s;tances, which will both &s;how the import|ance
<PB N="249" REF="255">
of this rule, and make the application of it be under&s;tood.</P>
<P>FIRST, In the po&s;ition of adverbs, which are u&s;ed to qualify the &s;ignification of &s;ome|thing which either precedes or follows them, there is often a good deal of nicety. <Q REND="inline">"By greatne&s;s,"</Q> &s;ays Mr. Addi&s;on, in the Spec|tator, No. 412. <Q REND="inline">"I do not only mean the bulk of any &s;ingle object, but the largene&s;s of a whole view."</Q> Here the place of the adverb <HI>only,</HI> renders it a limitation of the following word, mean. <Q REND="inline">"I do not only mean."</Q> The que&s;tion may then be put, What does he more than mean? Had he placed it after <HI>bulk,</HI> &s;till it would have been wrong. "I do not mean the <HI>bulk only</HI> of any &s;ingle object. For we might then a&s;k, What does he mean more than the bulk? Is it the colour? Or any other property? Its proper place, undoubtedly, is, after the word <HI>object.</HI> <Q REND="inline">"By greatne&s;s, I do not mean the bulk of any &s;ingle object only;"</Q> for then, when we put the que&s;tion, What more does he mean than the bulk of a &s;ingle object? The an&s;wer comes out exactly as the author intends, and gives it; <Q REND="inline">"The largene&s;s of a whole view."&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline">"Thei&s;m,"</Q> &s;ays Lord Shaft&s;bury, <Q REND="inline">"can only be oppo&s;ed to poly|thei&s;m, or athei&s;m."</Q> Does he mean that thei&s;m is capable of nothing el&s;e, except be|ing oppo&s;ed to polythei&s;m or athei&s;m? This is what his words literally import, through the wrong collocation of <HI>only.</HI> He &s;hould
<PB N="250" REF="256">
have &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Thei&s;m can be oppo&s;ed only to polythei&s;m or athei&s;m."</Q>&mdash;In like manner, Dean Swift (Project for the advancement of Religion), <Q REND="inline">"The Romans under&s;tood liberty, at lea&s;t, as well as we."</Q> The&s;e words are capable of two different &s;en&s;es, according as the empha&s;is, in reading them, is laid upon <HI>liberty,</HI> or upon <HI>at lea&s;t.</HI> In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, they will &s;ignify, that whatever other things we may under&s;tand better than the Romans, <HI>liberty,</HI> at lea&s;t, was one thing which they under&s;tood as well as we. In the &s;econd ca&s;e, they will import, that liberty was un|der&s;tood, <HI>at lea&s;t</HI> as well by them as by us; meaning, that by them it was better under|&s;tood. If this la&s;t, as I make no doubt, was Dean Swift's own meaning, the ambiguity would have been avoided, and the &s;en&s;e ren|dered independent of the manner of pro|nouncing, by arranging the words thus: <Q REND="inline">"The Romans under&s;tood liberty as well, at lea&s;t, as we."</Q> The fact is, with re&s;pect to &s;uch adverbs, as, <HI>only, wholly, at lea&s;t,</HI> and the re&s;t of that tribe, that in common di&s;|cour&s;e, the tone and empha&s;is we u&s;e in pro|nouncing them, generally &s;erves to &s;how their reference, and to make the meaning clear; and hence, we acquire a habit of throwing them in loo&s;ely in the cour&s;e of a period. But, in writing, where a man &s;peaks to the eye, and not to the ear, he ought to be more accurate; and &s;o to connect tho&s;e adverbs with the words which they qualify,
<PB N="251" REF="257">
as to put his meaning out of doubt upon the fir&s;t in&s;pection.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, When a circum&s;tance is inter|po&s;ed in the middle of a Sentence, it &s;ome|times requires attention how to place it, &s;o as to dive&s;t it of all ambiguity. For in&s;tance: <Q REND="inline">"Are the&s;e de&s;igns"</Q> (&s;ays Lord Bolingbroke, Di&s;&s;er. on Parties, Dedicat.) <Q REND="inline">"Are the&s;e de|&s;igns which any man, who is born a Bri|ton, in any circum&s;tances, in any &s;ituation, ought to be a&s;hamed or afraid to avow?"</Q> Here we are left at a lo&s;s, whether the&s;e words, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>in any circum&s;tance, in any &s;ituation,</HI>"</Q> are connected with, <Q REND="inline">"a man born in Britain, in any circum&s;tances, or &s;ituation,"</Q> or with that man's <Q REND="inline">"avowing his de&s;igns, in any cir|cum&s;tances, or &s;ituation, into which he may be brought?"</Q> If the latter, as &s;eems mo&s;t probable, was intended to be the mean|ing, the arrangement ought to have been conducted thus: <Q REND="inline">"Are the&s;e de&s;igns, which any man who is born a Briton, ought to be a&s;hamed or afraid, in any circum&s;tances, in any &s;ituation, to avow?"</Q> But,</P>
<P>THIRDLY, Still more attention is required to the proper di&s;po&s;ition of the relative pro|nouns, <HI>who, which, what, who&s;e,</HI> and of all tho&s;e particles which expre&s;s the connection of the parts of Speech with one another. As all rea&s;oning depends upon this connec|tion, we cannot be too accurate and preci&s;e here. A &s;mall error may overcloud the
<PB N="252" REF="258">
meaning of the whole Sentence; and even, where the meaning is intelligible, yet where the&s;e relative particles are out of their pro|per place, we always find &s;omething awk|ward and disjointed in the Structure of the Sentence. Thus, in the Spectator (No. 54.) <Q REND="inline">"This kind of wit,"</Q> &s;ays Mr. Addi&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"was very much in vogue among our country|men, about an age or two ago, who did not practi&s;e it for any oblique rea&s;on, but purely for the &s;ake of being witty."</Q> We are at no lo&s;s about the meaning here; but the con&s;truction would evidently be mended by di&s;po&s;ing of the circum&s;tance, <Q REND="inline">"about an age or two ago,"</Q> in &s;uch a manner as not to &s;eparate the relative <HI>who,</HI> from its antece|dent <HI>our countrymen;</HI> in this way: <Q REND="inline">"About an age or two ago, this kind of wit was very much in vogue among our country|men, who did not practi&s;e it for any ob|lique rea&s;on, but purely for the &s;ake of being witty." Spectator, No. 412.</Q> <Q REND="inline">"We no where meet with a more glorious and plea&s;ing &s;how in nature, than what ap|pears in the heavens at the ri&s;ing and &s;et|ting of the &s;un, <HI>which</HI> is wholly made up of the&s;e different &s;tains of light, that &s;how them&s;elves in clouds of a different &s;itua|tion."</Q> <HI>Which</HI> is here de&s;igned to connect with the word <HI>&s;how,</HI> as its antecedent; but it &s;tands &s;o wide from it, that without a careful attention to the &s;en&s;e, we would be naturally led, by the rules of &s;yntax, to re|fer it to the ri&s;ing and &s;etting of the &s;un, or
<PB N="253" REF="259">
to the &s;un it&s;elf; and, hence, an indi&s;tinct|ne&s;s is thrown over the whole Sentence. The following pa&s;&s;age in Bi&s;hop Sherlock's Ser|mons (Vol. II. Serm. 15.) is &s;till more cen|&s;urable: <Q REND="inline">"It is folly to pretend to arm our|&s;elves again&s;t the accidents of life, by heap|ing up trea&s;ures, which nothing can pro|tect us again&s;t, but the good providence of our Heavenly Father."</Q> <HI>Which,</HI> always re|fers grammatically to the immediately pre|ceding &s;ub&s;tantive, which here is, <Q REND="inline">"trea|&s;ures;"</Q> and this would make non&s;en&s;e of the whole Period. Every one feels this im|propriety. The Sentence ought to have &s;tood thus: <Q REND="inline">"It is folly to pretend, by heaping up trea&s;ures, to arm our&s;elves again&s;t the ac|cidents of life, which nothing can protect us again&s;t but the good providence of our Heavenly Father."</Q></P>
<P>OF the like nature is the following inac|curacy of Dean Swift's. He is recommend|ing to young clergymen, to write their &s;er|mons fully and di&s;tinctly. <Q REND="inline">"Many,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">"act &s;o directly contrary to this method, that, from a habit of &s;aving time and paper, which they acquired at the univer&s;ity, they write in &s;o diminutive a manner, that they can hardly read what they have writ|ten."</Q> He certainly does not mean, that they had acquired time and paper at the uni|ver&s;ity, but that they had acquired this habit there; and therefore his words ought to have run thus: <Q REND="inline">"from a habit which they have
<PB N="254" REF="260">
acquired at the univer&s;ity of &s;aving time and paper, they write in &s;o diminutive a manner."</Q> In another pa&s;&s;age, the &s;ame author has left his meaning altogether uncer|tain, by mi&s;placing a relative. It is in the conclu&s;ion of his letter to a member of par|liament, concerning the Sacramental Te&s;t: <Q REND="inline">"Thus I have fairly given you, Sir, my own opinion, as well as that of a great majority of both hou&s;es here, relating to this weigh|ty affair; upon which I am confident you may &s;ecurely reckon."</Q> Now I a&s;k, what it is he would have his corre&s;pondent to reckon upon, &s;ecurely? The natural con|&s;truction leads to the&s;e words, <Q REND="inline">"this weighty affair."</Q> But, as it would be difficult to make any &s;en&s;e of this, it is more probable he meant that the majority of both hou&s;es might be &s;ecurely reckoned upon; though certainly this meaning, as the words are arranged, is ob&s;curely expre&s;&s;ed. The &s;en|tence would be amended by arranging thus: <Q REND="inline">"Thus, Sir, I have given you my own opi|nion, relating to this weighty affair, as well as that of a great majerity of both hou&s;es here; upon which I am confident you may &s;ecurely reckon."</Q></P>
<P>Several other in&s;tances might be given; but I reckon tho&s;e which I have produced &s;ufficient to make the rule under&s;tood; that, in the con&s;truction of &s;entences, one of the fir&s;t things to be attended to, is, the mar|&s;halling of the words in &s;uch order as &s;hall
<PB N="255" REF="261">
mo&s;t clearly mark the relation of the &s;everal parts of the &s;entence to one another; parti|cularly, that adverbs &s;hall always be made to adhere clo&s;ely to the words which they are intended to qualify; that, where a circum|&s;tance is thrown in, it &s;hall never hang loo&s;e in the mid&s;t of a period, but be determined by its place to one or other member of it; and that every relative word which is u&s;ed, &s;hall in&s;tantly pre&s;ent its antecedent to the mind of the reader, without the lea&s;t ob&s;cu|rity. I have mentioned the&s;e three ca&s;es, becau&s;e I think they are the mo&s;t frequent occa&s;ions of ambiguity creeping into &s;en|tences.</P>
<P>WITH regard to Relatives, I mu&s;t farther ob&s;erve, that ob&s;curity often ari&s;es from the too frequent repetition of them, particularly of the pronouns <HI>who,</HI> and <HI>they,</HI> and <HI>them,</HI> and <HI>theirs,</HI> when we have occa&s;ion to refer to different per&s;ons; as, in the following &s;en|tence of archbi&s;hop Tillot&s;on (vol. I. &s;erm. 42.): <Q REND="inline">"Men look with an evil eye upon the good that is in others; and think that their reputation ob&s;cures them, and their com|mendable qualities &s;tand in their light; and therefore they do what they can to ca&s;t a cloud over them, that the bright &s;hining of their virtues may not ob&s;cure them."</Q> This is altogether carele&s;s writ|ing. It renders &s;tyle often ob&s;cure, always embarra&s;&s;ed and inelegant. When we find the&s;e per&s;onal pronouns crowding too fa&s;t
<PB N="256" REF="262">
upon us, we have often no method left, but to throw the whole &s;entence into &s;ome other form, which may avoid tho&s;e frequent refer|ences to per&s;ons who have before been men|tioned.</P>
<P>ALL languages are liable to ambiguities. Quinctilian gives us &s;ome in&s;tances in the Latin, ari&s;ing from faulty arrangement. A man, he tells us, ordered, by his will, to have erected for him, after his death, <Q REND="inline">"Statuam auream ha&s;tam tenentem;"</Q> upon which aro&s;e a di&s;pute at law, whether the whole &s;tatue, or the &s;pear only, was to be of gold? The &s;ame author ob&s;erves, very properly, that a &s;entence is always faulty, when the collocation of the words is ambiguous, though the &s;en&s;e can be gathered. If any one &s;hould &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Chremetem audivi percu&s;&s;i&s;&s;e Demeam,"</Q> this is ambiguous both in &s;en&s;e and &s;tructure, whether Chremes or Demea gave the blow. But if this expre&s;&s;ion were u&s;ed, <Q REND="inline">"Se vidi&s;&s;e hominem librum &s;cribentem,"</Q> although the meaning be clear, yet Quinctilian in&s;i&s;ts that the arrangement is wrong. <Q REND="inline">"Nam,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">"etiam&s;i librum ab homine &s;cribi pateat, non cert&egrave; hominem a libro, mal&egrave; tamen compo|&s;uerat, feceratque ambiguum quantum in ip&s;o fuit."</Q> Indeed, to have the relation of every word and member of a &s;entence mark|ed in the mo&s;t proper and di&s;tinct manner, gives not clearne&s;s only, but grace and beau|ty to a &s;entence, making the mind pa&s;s
<PB N="257" REF="263">
&s;moothly and agreeably along all the parts of it.</P>
<P>I PROCEED now to the &s;econd quality of a well-arranged &s;entence, which I termed its Unity. This is a capital property. In eve|ry compo&s;ition, of whatever kind, &s;ome de|gree of unity is required, in order to render it beautiful. There mu&s;t be always &s;ome connecting principle among the parts. Some one object mu&s;t reign and be predominant. This, as I &s;hall hereafter &s;hew, holds in Hi&s;|tory, in Epic and Dramatic Poetry, and in all orations. But mo&s;t of all, in a &s;ingle &s;en|tence, is required the &s;tricte&s;t unity. For the very nature of a &s;entence implies one propo|&s;ition to be expre&s;&s;ed. It may con&s;i&s;t of parts, indeed; but the&s;e parts mu&s;t be &s;o clo&s;ely bound together, as to make the impre&s;&s;ion upon the mind, of one object, not of many. Now, in order to pre&s;erve this unity of a &s;en|tence, the following rules mu&s;t be ob&s;erved:</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, during the cour&s;e of the &s;entence, the &s;cene &s;hould be changed as lit|tle as po&s;&s;ible. We &s;hould not be hurried by &s;udden tran&s;itions from per&s;on to per&s;on, nor from &s;ubject to &s;ubject. There is com|monly, in every &s;entence, &s;ome per&s;on or thing, which is the governing word. This &s;hould be continued &s;o, if po&s;&s;ible, from the beginning to the end of it. Should I expre&s;s my&s;elf thus: <Q REND="inline">"After we came to anchor, they put me on &s;hore, where I was wel|comed
<PB N="258" REF="264">
by all my friends, who received me with the greate&s;t kindne&s;s."</Q> In this &s;en|tence, though the objects contained in it have a &s;ufficient connection with each other, yet, by this manner of repre&s;enting them, by &s;hifting &s;o often both the place and the per&s;on, <HI>we,</HI> and <HI>they,</HI> and <HI>I,</HI> and <HI>who,</HI> they appear in &s;uch a di&s;united view, that the &s;en&s;e of connection is almo&s;t lo&s;t. The &s;en|tence is re&s;tored to its proper unity, by turn|ing it after the following manner: <Q REND="inline">"Having come to an anchor, I was put on &s;hore, where I was welcomed by all my friends, and received with the greate&s;t kindne&s;s."</Q> Writers who tran&s;gre&s;s this rule, for the mo&s;t part tran&s;gre&s;s, at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>A SECOND rule; never to crowd into one &s;entence, things which have &s;o little connec|tion, that they could bear to be divided into two or three &s;entences. The violation of this rule never fails to hurt, and di&s;plea&s;e a reader. Its effect, indeed, is &s;o bad, that, of the two, it is the &s;afe&s;t extreme, to err rather by too many &s;hort &s;entences, than by one that is overloaded and embarra&s;&s;ed. Ex|amples abound in authors. I &s;hall produce &s;ome, to ju&s;tify what I now &s;ay. <Q REND="inline">"Arch|bi&s;hop Tillot&s;on,"</Q> &s;ays an Author of the Hi&s;tory of England, <Q REND="inline">"died in this year. He was exceedingly beloved both by King William and Queen Mary, who nominated Dr. Tenni&s;on, Bi&s;hop of Lincoln, to &s;uc|ceed him."</Q> Who would expect the latter
<PB N="259" REF="265">
part of this &s;entence to follow, in con&s;e|quence of the former? <Q REND="inline">"He was exceedingly beloved by both King and Queen,"</Q> is the propo&s;ition of the &s;entence: we look for &s;ome proof of this, or at lea&s;t &s;omething re|lated to it, to follow; when we are on a &s;udden carried off to a new propo&s;ition, <Q REND="inline">"who nominated Dr. Tenni&s;on to &s;ucceed him."</Q> The following is from Middleton's Life of Cicero: <Q REND="inline">"In this unea&s;y &s;tate, both of his public and private life, Cicero was oppre&s;&s;ed by a new and cruel affliction, the death of his beloved daughter Tullia; which happened &s;oon after her divorce from Dolabella; who&s;e manners and hu|mours were entirely di&s;agreeable to her."</Q> The principal object in this &s;entence is, the death of Tullia, which was the cau&s;e of her father's affliction; the date of it, as happen|ing &s;oon after her divorce from Dolabella, may enter into the &s;entence with propriety; but the &s;ubjunction of Dolabella's character is foreign to the main object; and breaks the unity and compactne&s;s of the &s;entence total|ly, by &s;etting a new picture before the reader. The following &s;entence, from a tran&s;lation of Plutarch, is &s;till wor&s;e: <Q REND="inline">"Their march,"</Q> &s;ays the Author, &s;peaking of the Greeks un|der Alexander, <Q REND="inline">"their march was through an uncultivated country, who&s;e &s;avage inha|bitants fared hardly, having no other riches than a breed of lean &s;heep, who&s;e fle&s;h was rank and un&s;avoury, by rea&s;on of their continual feeding upon &s;ea-fi&s;h."</Q> Here
<PB N="260" REF="266">
the &s;cene is changed upon us again and again. The march of the Greeks, the de&s;cription of the inhabitants through who&s;e country they travelled, the account of their &s;heep, and the cau&s;e of their &s;heep being ill-ta&s;ted food, form a jumble of objects, &s;lightly related to each other, which the reader cannot, with|out much difficulty, comprehend under one view.</P>
<P>THESE examples have been taken from &s;entences of no great length, yet over-crowd|ed. Authors who deal in long &s;entences, are very apt to be faulty in this article. One need only open Lord Clarendon's Hi&s;tory, to find examples every where. The long, in|volved, and intricate &s;entences of that Au|thor, are the greate&s;t blemi&s;h of his compo|&s;ition; though, in other re&s;pects, as a Hi&s;to|rian, he has con&s;iderable merit. In later, and more correct writers than Lord Claren|don, we find a period &s;ometimes running out &s;o far, and comprehending &s;o many particu|lars, as to be more properly a di&s;cour&s;e than a &s;entence. Take, for an in&s;tance, the fol|lowing from Sir William Temple, in his E&s;|&s;ay upon Poetry: <Q REND="inline">"The u&s;ual acceptation takes Profit and Plea&s;ure for two different things; and not only calls the followers or votaries of them by the &s;everal names of Bu&s;y and Idle Men; but di&s;tingui&s;hes the faculties of the mind, that are conver&s;ant about them, calling the operations of the fir&s;t, Wi&s;dom; and of the other, Wit;
<PB N="261" REF="267">
which is a Saxon word, u&s;ed to expre&s;s what the Spaniards and Italians call <HI>Inge|nio,</HI> and the French, <HI>E&s;prit,</HI> both from the Latin; though I think Wit more particu|larly &s;ignifies that of Poetry, as may occur in Remarks on the Runic Language."</Q> When one arrives at the end of &s;uch a puz|zled &s;entence, he is &s;urpri&s;ed to find him&s;elf got to &s;o great a di&s;tance from the object with which he at fir&s;t &s;et out.</P>
<P>LORD SHAFTSBURY, often betrayed into faults by his love of magnificence, &s;hall afford us the next example. It is in his Rhap&s;ody, where he is de&s;cribing the cold regions: <Q REND="inline">"At length,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">"the Sun approaching, melts the &s;now, &s;ets longing men at liber|ty, and affords them means and time to make provi&s;ion again&s;t the next return of Cold."</Q> This fir&s;t &s;entence is correct enough; but he goes on: <Q REND="inline">"It breaks the icy fetters of the main, where va&s;t &s;ea-mon&s;ters pierce through floating i&s;lands, with arms which can with&s;tand the cry&s;tal rock; whil&s;t others, who of them&s;elves &s;eem great as i&s;lands, are by their bulk alone armed again&s;t all but Man, who&s;e &s;uperi|ority over creatures of &s;uch &s;tupendous &s;ize and force, &s;hould make him mindful of his privilege of Rea&s;on, and force him humbly to adore the great Compo&s;er of the&s;e wondrous frames, and the Author of his own &s;uperior wi&s;dom."</Q> Nothing can be more unhappy or embarra&s;&s;ed than this
<PB N="262" REF="268">
&s;entence; the wor&s;e too, as it is intended to be de&s;criptive, where every thing &s;hould be clear. It forms no di&s;tinct image whatever. The <HI>It,</HI> at the beginning, is ambiguous, whe|ther it mean the Sun or the Cold. The ob|ject is changed three times in the &s;entence; beginning with the Sun, which breaks the icy fetters of the main; then the Sea-mon|&s;ters become the principal per&s;onages; and la&s;tly, by a very unexpected tran&s;ition, Man is brought into view, and receives a long and &s;erious admonition before the &s;entence clo&s;es. I do not at pre&s;ent in&s;i&s;t on the impropriety of &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions as, <HI>God's being the Com|po&s;er of Frames;</HI> and the Sea-mon&s;ters hav|ing <HI>arms that with&s;tand rocks.</HI> Shaft&s;bury's &s;trength lay in rea&s;oning and &s;entiment, more than in de&s;cription; however much his de&s;criptions have been &s;ometimes admired.</P>
<P>I SHALL only give one in&s;tance more on this head, from Dean Swift; in his propo&s;al, too, for correcting the Engli&s;h Language: where, in place of a &s;entence, he has given a loo&s;e di&s;&s;ertation upon &s;everal &s;ubjects. Speaking of the progre&s;s of our language, after the time of Cromwell: <Q REND="inline">"To this &s;uc|ceeded,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">"that licentiou&s;ne&s;s, which entered with the Re&s;toration, and, from infecting our religion and morals, fell to corrupt our language; which la&s;t was not like to be much improved by tho&s;e, who at that time made up the court of King Charles the Second; either &s;uch as
<PB N="263" REF="269">
had followed him in his bani&s;hment, or who had been altogether conver&s;ant in the dialect of the&s;e fanatic times; or young men, who had been educated in the &s;ame country: &s;o that the Court, which u&s;ed to be the &s;tandard of correctne&s;s and pro|priety of &s;peech, was then, and I think has ever &s;ince continued, the wor&s;t &s;chool in England for that accompli&s;hment; and &s;o will remain, till better care be taken in the education of our nobility, that they may &s;et out into the world with &s;ome foun|dation of literature, in order to qualify them for patterns of politene&s;s."</Q> How many different facts, rea&s;onings, and ob&s;erva|tions, are here pre&s;ented to the mind at once! and yet &s;o linked together by the Author, that they all make parts of a &s;entence, which admits of no greater divi&s;ion in pointing, than a &s;emicolon between any of its members? Having mentioned pointing, I &s;hall here take notice, that it is in vain to propo&s;e, by arbi|trary punctuation, to amend the defects of a Sentence, to correct its ambiguity, or to pre|vent its confu&s;ion. For commas, colons, and points, do not make the proper divi&s;ions of thought; but only &s;erve to mark tho&s;e which ari&s;e from the tenor of the Author's expre&s;|&s;ion: and, therefore, they are proper or not, ju&s;t according as they corre&s;pond to the na|tural divi&s;ions of the &s;en&s;e. When they are in&s;erted in wrong places, they de&s;erve, and will meet with, no regard.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="270">
I PROCEED to a third rule, for pre&s;erving the Unity of Sentences; which is, to keep clear of all Parenthe&s;es in the middle of them. On &s;ome occa&s;ions, the&s;e may have a &s;pirited appearance; as prompted by a certain viva|city of thought, which can glance happily a&s;ide, as it is going along. But, for the mo&s;t part, their effect is extremely bad; being a &s;ort of wheels within wheels; &s;entences in the mid&s;t of &s;entences; the perplexed me|thod of di&s;po&s;ing of &s;ome thought, which a writer wants art to introduce in its proper place. It were needle&s;s to give many in|&s;tances, as they occur &s;o often among incor|rect writers. I &s;hall produce one from Lord Bolingbroke, the rapidity of who&s;e genius, and manner of writing, betrays him frequent|ly into inaccuracies of this &s;ort. It is in the Introduction to his Idea of a Patriot King, where he writes thus: <Q REND="inline">"It &s;eems to me, that, in order to maintain the &s;y&s;tem of the world, at a certain point, far below that of ideal perfection (for we are made capa|ble of conceiving what we are incapable of attaining), but, however, &s;ufficient, up|on the whole, to con&s;titute a &s;tate ea&s;y and happy, or at the wor&s;t, tolerable; I &s;ay, it &s;eems to me, that the Author of Nature has thought fit to mingle, from time to time, among the &s;ocieties of men, a few, and but a few, of tho&s;e on whom he is graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to be&s;tow a larger portion of the Ethereal Spirit, than is giv|en, in the ordinary cour&s;e of his govern|ment,
<PB N="265" REF="271">
to the &s;ons of men."</Q> A very bad Sentence this; into which, by the help of a Parenthe&s;is, and other interjected circum|&s;tances, his Lord&s;hip had contrived to thru&s;t &s;o many things, that he is forced to begin the con&s;truction again with the phra&s;e <HI>I &s;ay;</HI> which, whenever it occurs, may be always a&s;&s;umed as a &s;ure mark of a clum&s;y ill-con|&s;tructed Sentence; excu&s;able in &s;peaking, where the greate&s;t accuracy is not expected, but in poli&s;hed writing, unpardonable.</P>
<P>I SHALL add only one rule more for the Unity of a Sentence, which is, to bring it always to a full and perfect clo&s;e. Every thing that is one, &s;hould have a beginning, a middle, and an end. I need not take notice, that an unfini&s;hed Sentence is no Sentence at all, according to any grammatical rule. But very often we meet with Sentences that are, &s;o to &s;peak, more than fini&s;hed. When we have arrived at what we expected was to be the conclu&s;ion, when we have come to the word on which the mind is naturally led, by what went before, to re&s;t; unexpectedly, &s;ome circum&s;tance pops out, which ought to have been omitted, or to have been di&s;po&s;ed of el&s;ewhere; but which is left lagging be|hind, like a tail adjected to the Sentence; &s;omewhat that, as Mr. Pope de&s;cribes the Alexandrine line,
<Q><L>"Like a wounded &s;nake, drags its &s;low length along."</L></Q>
<PB N="266" REF="272">
All the&s;e adjections to the proper clo&s;e, dis|figure a Sentence extremely. They give it a lame ungraceful air, and, in particular, they break its Unity. Dean Swift, for in&s;tance, in his Letter to a Young Clergyman, &s;peak|ing of Cicero's writings, expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf thus: <Q REND="inline">"With the&s;e writings, young divines are more conver&s;ant,"</Q> than with tho&s;e of Demo&s;thenes, who, by many degrees, ex|celled the other; <Q REND="inline">"at lea&s;t, as an orator."</Q> Here the natural clo&s;e of the Sentence is at the&s;e words, <Q REND="inline">"excelled the other."</Q> The&s;e words conclude the propo&s;ition; we look for no more; and the circum&s;tance added, <Q REND="inline">"at lea&s;t, as an orator,"</Q> comes in with a very halting pace. How much more compact would the Sentence have been, if turned thus: <Q REND="inline">"With the&s;e writings, young divines are more conver&s;ant, than with tho&s;e of Demo&s;thenes, who, by many degrees, as an orator at lea&s;t, excelled the other."</Q> In the following Sentence, from Sir William Temple, the adjection to the Sentence is al|together foreign to it. Speaking of Burnet's Theory of the Earth, and Fontenelle's Plu|rality of Worlds, <Q REND="inline">"The fir&s;t,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">"could not end his learned treati&s;e, without a panegyric of modern learning, in com|pari&s;on of the antient; and the other, falls &s;o gro&s;sly into the cen&s;ure of the old poe|try, and preference of the new, that I could not read either of the&s;e &s;trains without &s;ome indignation; which no quality among
<PB N="267" REF="273">
men is &s;o apt to rai&s;e in me as &s;elf-&s;uffici|ency."</Q> The word <Q REND="inline">"indignation,"</Q> con|cluded the Sentence; the la&s;t member, <Q REND="inline">"which no quality among men is &s;o apt to rai&s;e in me as &s;elf-&s;ufficiency,"</Q> is a pro|po&s;ition altogether new, added after the proper clo&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>LECTURE XII. STRUCTURE OF SENTENCES.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING treated of Per&s;picuity and Uni|ty, as nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;tudied in the Structure of Sentences, I proceed to the third quality of a correct Sentence, which I termed Strength. By this, I mean, &s;uch a di&s;po&s;i|tion of the &s;everal words and members, as &s;hall bring out the &s;en&s;e to the be&s;t advant|age; as &s;hall render the impre&s;&s;ion, which the Period is de&s;igned to make, mo&s;t full and complete; and give every word, and every member, its due weight and force. The two former qualities of Per&s;picuity and Unity, are, no doubt, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the production of this effect; but more is &s;till requi&s;ite. For a Sentence may be clear enough; it may al&s;o be compact enough, in all its parts, or have the requi&s;ite unity; and yet, by &s;ome unfavourable circum&s;tance in the &s;tructure, it may fail in that &s;trength or
<PB N="269" REF="275">
liveline&s;s of impre&s;&s;ion, which a more happy arrangement would have produced.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t rule which I &s;hall give, for pro|moting the Strength of a Sentence, is, to prune it of all redundant words. The&s;e may, &s;ometimes, be con&s;i&s;tent with a con&s;i|derable degree both of Clearne&s;s and Unity; but they are always enfeebling. They make the Sentence move along tardy and encum|bered;
<Q><L>E&s;t brevitate opus, ut currat &s;ententia, neu &s;e</L>
<L>Impediat verbis, la&s;&s;as onerantibus aures<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>"Conci&s;e your diction, let your &s;en&s;e be clear,</L>
<L>"Nor, with a weight of words, fatigue the ear.</L>
<BIBL>FRANCIS.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>.</L></Q>
It is a general maxim, that any words, which do not add &s;ome importance to the meaning of a Sentence, always &s;poil it. They cannot be &s;uperfluous, without being hurtful. <Q REND="inline">"Ob|&s;tat,"</Q> &s;ays Quinctilian, <Q REND="inline">"quicquid non ad|juvat."</Q> All that can be ea&s;ily &s;upplied in the mind, is better left out in the expre&s;&s;ion. Thus: <Q REND="inline">"Content with de&s;erving a triumph, he refu&s;ed the honour of it,"</Q> is better Lan|guage than to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Being content with de|&s;erving a triumph, he refu&s;ed the honour of it."</Q> I con&s;ider it, therefore, as one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful exerci&s;es of correction, upon reviewing what we have written or compo&s;|ed, to contract that round-about method of expre&s;&s;ion, and to lop off tho&s;e u&s;ele&s;s ex|cre&s;cences
<PB N="270" REF="276">
which are commonly found in a fir&s;t draught. Here a &s;evere eye &s;hould be employed; and we &s;hall always find our Sentences acquire more vigour and energy when thus retrenched; provided always, that we run not into the extreme of pruning &s;o very clo&s;e, as to give a hardne&s;s and dryne&s;s to &s;tyle. For here, as in all other things, there is a due medium. Some regard, though not the principal, mu&s;t be had to fullne&s;s and &s;welling of &s;ound. Some leaves mu&s;t be left to &s;helter and &s;urround the fruit.</P>
<P>AS Sentences &s;hould be cleared of redun|dant words, &s;o al&s;o of redundant members. As every word ought to pre&s;ent a new idea, &s;o every member ought to contain a new thought. Oppo&s;ed to this, &s;tands the fault we &s;ometimes meet with, of the la&s;t member of a period, being no other than the echo of the former, or the repetition of it in &s;ome|what a different form. For example; &s;peak|ing of Beauty, <Q REND="inline">"The very fir&s;t di&s;covery of it,"</Q> &s;ays Mr. Addi&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"&s;trikes the mind with inward joy, and &s;preads delight through all its faculties." <BIBL>(No. 412)</BIBL></Q> And el&s;ewhere, <Q REND="inline">"It is impo&s;&s;ible for us to behold the divine works with coldne&s;s or indifference, or to &s;urvey &s;o many beauties, without a &s;ecret &s;atisfaction and complacency." <BIBL>(No. 413)</BIBL></Q> In both the&s;e in&s;tances, little or nothing is added by the &s;econd member of the Sentence to what was already expre&s;&s;ed in the fir&s;t:
<PB N="271" REF="277">
And though the free and flowing manner of &s;uch an author as Mr. Addi&s;on, and the graceful harmony of his period, may palliate &s;uch negligences; yet, in general, it holds, that &s;tyle, freed from this prolixity, appears both more &s;trong, and more beautiful. The attention becomes remi&s;s, the mind falls into inaction, when words are multiplied without a corre&s;ponding multiplication of ideas.</P>
<P>AFTER removing &s;uperfluities, the &s;econd direction I give, for promoting the Strength of a Sentence, is, to attend particularly to the u&s;e of copulatives, relatives, and all the particles employed for tran&s;ition and connec|tion. The&s;e little words, <HI>but, and, which, who&s;e, where,</HI> &amp;c. are frequently the mo&s;t important words of any; they are the joints or hinges upon which all Sentences turn, and, of cour&s;e, much, both of their gracefulne&s;s and &s;trength, mu&s;t depend upon &s;uch parti|cles. The varieties in u&s;ing them are, in|deed, &s;o infinite, that no particular &s;y&s;tem of rules, re&s;pecting them, can be given. At|tention to the practice of the mo&s;t accurate writers, joined with frequent trials of the different effects, produced by a different u&s;age of tho&s;e particles, mu&s;t here direct us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On this head, Dr. Lowth's Short Introduction to Engli&s;h Grammar de&s;erves to be con&s;ulted; where &s;everal niceties of the Language are well pointed out.</NOTE>. Some ob&s;ervations, I &s;hall mention, which have occurred to me as u&s;eful, without pre|tending to exhau&s;t the &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="278">
WHAT is called &s;plitting of particles, or &s;eparating a prepo&s;ition from the noun which it governs, is always to be avoided. As if I &s;hould &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Though virtue borrows no a&s;|&s;i&s;tance from, yet it may often be accom|panied by, the advantages of fortune."</Q> In &s;uch in&s;tances, we feel a &s;ort of pain, from the revul&s;ion, or violent &s;eparation of two things, which, by their nature, &s;hould be clo&s;ely united. We are put to a &s;tand be clo&s;ely united. We are put to a &s;tand in thought; being obliged to re&s;t for a little on the prepo&s;ition by it&s;elf, which, at the &s;ame time, carries no &s;ignificancy, till it is joined to its proper &s;ub&s;tantive noun.</P>
<P>SOME writers needle&s;sly multiply demon|&s;trative and relative particles, by the frequent u&s;e of &s;uch phra&s;eology as this: <Q REND="inline">"There is nothing which di&s;gu&s;ts us &s;ooner than the empty pomp of Language."</Q> In introduc|ing a &s;ubject, or laying down a propo&s;ition, to which we demand particular attention, this &s;ort of &s;tyle is very proper; but, in the ordinary current of di&s;cour&s;e, it is better to expre&s;s our&s;elves more &s;imply and &s;hortly: <Q REND="inline">"Nothing di&s;gu&s;ts us &s;ooner than the empty pomp of Language."</Q></P>
<P>OTHER writers make a practice of omit|ting the Relative, in a phra&s;e of a different kind from the former, where they think the meaning can be under&s;tood without it. As, <Q REND="inline">"The man I love."&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline">"The dominions we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and the conque&s;ts we made."</Q>
<PB N="273" REF="279">
But though this elliptical &s;tyle be intelligible, and is allowable in conver&s;ation and epi&s;to|lary writing, yet, in all writings of a &s;erious or dignified kind, it is ungraceful. There, the Relative &s;hould always be in&s;erted in its proper place, and the con&s;truction filled up: <Q REND="inline">"The man whom I love."&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline">"The dominions which we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and the conque&s;ts which we made."</Q></P>
<P>WITH regard to the Copulative particle, <HI>and,</HI> which occurs &s;o frequently in all kinds of compo&s;ition, &s;everal ob&s;ervations are to be made. Fir&s;t, It is evident, that the un|nece&s;&s;ary repetition of it enfeebles &s;tyle. It has the &s;ame &s;ort of effect, as the frequent u&s;e of the vulgar phra&s;e, <HI>and &s;o,</HI> when one is telling a &s;tory in common conver&s;ation. We &s;hall take a Sentence from Sir William Temple, for an in&s;tance. He is &s;peaking of the refinement of the French Language: <Q REND="inline">"The academy &s;et up by Cardinal Richlieu, to amu&s;e the wits of that age and country, and divert them from raking into his poli|tics and mini&s;try, brought this into vogue; and the French wits have, for this la&s;t age, been wholly turned to the refinement of their Style and Language; and, indeed, with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that it can hardly be equalled, and runs equally through their ver&s;e and their pro&s;e."</Q> Here are no fewer than eight <HI>ands</HI> in one &s;entence. This agree|able writer too often makes his &s;entences drag in this manner, by a carele&s;s multiplication
<PB N="274" REF="280">
of Copulatives. It is &s;trange how a writer, &s;o accurate as Dean Swift, &s;hould have &s;tum|bled on &s;o improper an application of this particle, as he has made in the following &s;en|tence; E&s;&s;ay on the Fates of Clergymen. <Q REND="inline">"There is no talent &s;o u&s;eful towards ri&s;ing in the world, or which puts men more out of the reach of fortune, than that quality generally po&s;&s;e&s;t by the dulle&s;t &s;ort of peo|ple, and is, in common language, called Di&s;cretion; a &s;pecies of lower prudence, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of which, &amp;c."</Q> By the in&s;ertion of, <HI>and is,</HI> in place of, <HI>which is,</HI> he has not only clogged the Sentence, but even made it ungrammatical.</P>
<P>BUT, in the next place, it is worthy of ob&s;ervation, that though the natural u&s;e of the conjunction, <HI>and,</HI> be to join objects to|gether, and thereby, as one would think, to make their connexion more clo&s;e; yet, in fact, by dropping the conjunction, we often mark a clo&s;er connexion, a quicker &s;ucce&s;&s;i|on of objects, than when it is in&s;erted be|tween them. Longinus makes this remark; which from many in&s;tances, appears to be ju&s;t: <Q REND="inline">"Veni, vidi, vici<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"I came, I &s;aw, I conquered."</Q></NOTE>,"</Q> expre&s;&s;es with more &s;pirit, the rapidity and quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of conque&s;t, than if connecting particles had been u&s;ed. So, in the following de&s;cription of a rout in Cae&s;ar's Commentaries: <Q REND="inline">"No&s;|tri, emi&s;&s;is pilis, gladiis rem gerunt; re|pente
<PB N="275" REF="281">
po&s;t tergum equitatus cernitur; co|hortes aliae appropinquant. Ho&s;tes terga vertunt; fugientibus equites occurrunt; &s;it magna caedes." <BIBL>Bell. Gall. l. 7<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Our men, after having di&s;charged their javelins, attack with &s;word in hand: of a &s;udden, the cavalry make their appearance behind; other bodies of men are &s;een drawing near: the enemies turn their backs; the hor&s;e meet them in their flight; a great &s;laughter en&s;ues."</Q></NOTE>.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>HENCE, it follows, that when, on the other hand, we &s;eek to prevent a quick tran&s;ition from one object to another, when we are making &s;ome enumeration, in which we wi&s;h that the objects &s;hould appear as di&s;tinct from each other as po&s;&s;ible, and that the mind &s;hould re&s;t, for a moment, on each object by it&s;elf; in this ca&s;e, Copulatives may be mul|tiplied with peculiar advantage and grace. As when Lord Bolingbroke &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"Such a man might fall a victim to power; but truth, and rea&s;on, and liberty, would fall with him."</Q> In the &s;ame manner, Cae&s;ar de&s;cribes an engagement with the Nervii: <Q REND="inline">"His equitibus facile pul&s;is ac proturbatis, incredibile celeritate ad flumen decurre|runt; ut pene uno tempore, et ad &s;ilvas, et in flumine, et jam in manibus no&s;tris, ho&s;tes viderentur." <BIBL>Bell. Gall. l. 2<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"The enemy, having ea&s;ily beat off, and &s;cattered this body of hor&s;e, ran down with incredible celerity to the river; &s;o that, almo&s;t at one moment of time, they appeared to be in the woods, and in the river, and in the mid&s;t of our troops."</Q></NOTE>.</BIBL></Q> Here, although he is de&s;cribing a quick &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
<PB N="276" REF="282">
of events, yet, as it is his intention to &s;how in how many places the enemy &s;eem|ed to be at one time, the Copulative is very happily redoubled, in order to paint more &s;trongly the di&s;tinction of the&s;e &s;everal places.</P>
<P>THIS attention to the &s;everal ca&s;es, when it is proper to emit, and when to redouble the Copulative, is of con&s;iderable importance to all who &s;tudy eloquence. For, it is a re|markable particularity in Language, that the omi&s;&s;ion of a connecting particle &s;hould &s;ome|times &s;erve to make objects appear more clo&s;e|ly connected; and that the repetition of it &s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h and &s;eparate them, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, from each other. Hence, the omi&s;|&s;ion of it is u&s;ed to denote rapidity; and the repetition of it is de&s;igned to retard and to aggravate. The rea&s;on &s;eems to be, that, in the former ca&s;e, the mind is &s;uppo&s;ed to be hurried &s;o fa&s;t through a quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of objects, that it has not lei&s;ure to point out their connexion; it drops the Copulatives in its hurry; and crowds the whole &s;eries toge|ther, as if it were but one object. Whereas, when we enumerate, with a view to aggra|vate, the mind is &s;uppo&s;ed to proceed with a more &s;low and &s;olemn pace; it marks fully the relation of each object to that which &s;ucceeds it; and, by joining them together with &s;everal Copulatives, makes you attend, that the objects, though connected, are yet, in them&s;elves, di&s;tinct; that they are many,
<PB N="277" REF="283">
not one. Ob&s;erve, for in&s;tance, in the fol|lowing enumeration, made by the Apo&s;tle Paul, what additional weight and di&s;tinctne&s;s is given to each particular, by the repetition of a conjunction. <Q REND="inline">"I am per&s;waded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things pre|&s;ent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, &s;hall be able to &s;eparate us from the love of God." <BIBL>Rom. viii. 38, 39.</BIBL></Q> So much with regard to the u&s;e of Copulatives.</P>
<P>I PROCEED to a third rule, for promoting the &s;trength of a Sentence, which is, to di&s;|po&s;e of the capital word, or words, in that place of the Sentence, where they will make the fulle&s;t impre&s;&s;ion. That &s;uch capital words there are in every Sentence, on which the meaning principally re&s;ts, every one mu&s;t &s;ee; and that the&s;e words &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s a con&s;picuous and di&s;tingui&s;hed place, is equal|ly plain. Indeed, that place of the Sentence where they will make the be&s;t figure, whe|ther the beginning, or the end, or, &s;ome|times, even the middle, cannot, as far as I know, be a&s;certained by any preci&s;e rule. This mu&s;t vary with the nature of the Sen|tence. Per&s;picuity mu&s;t ever be &s;tudied in the fir&s;t place; and the nature of our Lan|guage allows no great liberty in the choice of collocation. For the mo&s;t part, with us, the important words are placed in the beginning of the Sentence. So Mr. Addi&s;on: <Q REND="inline">"The
<PB N="278" REF="284">
plea&s;ures of the imagination, taken in their full extent, are not &s;o gro&s;s as tho&s;e of &s;en&s;e, nor &s;o refined as tho&s;e of the under&s;tand|ing."</Q> And this, indeed, &s;eems the mo&s;t plain and natural order, to place that in the front which is the chief object of the propo|&s;ition we are laying down. Sometimes, how|ever, when we intend to give weight to a Sentence, it is of advantage to &s;u&s;pend the meaning for a little, and then bring it out full at the clo&s;e: <Q REND="inline">"Thus,"</Q> &s;ays Mr. Pope, <Q REND="inline">"on whatever &s;ide we contemplate Homer, what principally &s;trikes us, is, his wonder|ful invention." <BIBL>(Pref. to Homer.)</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>THE Greek and Latin writers had a con|&s;iderable advantage above us, in this part of &s;tyle. By the great liberty of inver&s;ion, which their Languages permitted, they could chu&s;e the mo&s;t advantageous &s;ituation for every word; and had it thereby in their pow|er to give their Sentences more force. Mil|ton, in his pro&s;e works, and &s;ome other of our old Engli&s;h writers, endeavoured to imi|tate them in this. But the forced con&s;truc|tions, which they employed, produced ob|&s;curity; and the genius of our Language, as it is now written and &s;poken, will not admit &s;uch liberties. Mr. Gordon, who followed this inverted &s;tyle in his Tran&s;lation of Ta|citus, has, &s;ometimes, done &s;uch violence to the Language, as even to appear ridiculous; as in this expre&s;&s;ion: <Q REND="inline">"Into this hole thru&s;t them&s;elves three Roman &s;enators"</Q> He has
<PB N="279" REF="285">
tran&s;lated &s;o &s;imple a phra&s;e as, <Q REND="inline">"Nullum e&acirc; tempe&s;tate bellum,"</Q> by, <Q REND="inline">"War at that time there was none."</Q> However, within certain bounds, and to a limited degree, our Language does admit of inver&s;ions; and they are practi&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s by the be&s;t writers. So Mr. Pope, &s;peaking of Homer, <Q REND="inline">"The prai&s;e of judgment Virgil has ju&s;tly conte&s;ted with him, but his invention remains yet unrival|led."</Q> It is evident, that, in order to give the Sentence its due force, by contra&s;ting properly the two capital words, <Q REND="inline">"judgment and invention,"</Q> this is a happier arrange|ment than if he had followed the natural order, which was, <Q REND="inline">"Virgil has ju&s;tly conte&s;t|ed with him the prai&s;e of judgment, but his invention remains yet unrivalled."</Q></P>
<P>SOME writers practi&s;e this degree of inver|&s;ion, which our Language bears, much more than others; Lord Shaft&s;bury, for in&s;tance, much more than Mr. Addi&s;on; and to this &s;ort of arrangement is owing, in a great mea|&s;ure, that appearance of &s;trength, dignity, and varied harmony, which Lord Shaft&s;bu|ry's &s;tyle po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. This will appear from the following Sentences of his Enquiry into Virtue; where all the words are placed, not &s;trictly in the natural order, but with that artificial con&s;truction, which may give the period mo&s;t empha&s;is and grace. He is &s;peak|ing of the mi&s;ery of vice: <Q REND="inline">"This, as to the complete immoral &s;tate, is, what of their own accord, men readily remark. Where
<PB N="280" REF="286">
there is this ab&s;olute degeneracy, this total apo&s;tacy from all candor, tru&s;t, or equity, there are few who do not &s;ee and acknow|ledge the mi&s;ery which is con&s;equent. Seldom is the ca&s;e mi&s;con&s;trued, when at wor&s;t. The misfortune is, that we look not on this depravity, nor con&s;ider how it &s;tands, in le&s;s degrees. As if, to be ab&s;o|lutely immoral, were, indeed, the greate&s;t mi&s;ery; but, to be &s;o in a little degree, &s;hould be no mi&s;ery or harm at all. Which, to allow, is ju&s;t as rea&s;onable as to own, that 'tis the greate&s;t ill of a body to be in the utmo&s;t manner maimed or di&s;torted; but that, to lo&s;e the u&s;e only of one limb, or to be impaired in &s;ome &s;ingle organ or member, is no ill worthy the lea&s;t notice." <BIBL>(Vol. ii. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">.)</BIBL></Q> Here is no violence done to the Language, though there are many inver|&s;ions. All is &s;tately, and arranged with art; which is the great characteri&s;tic of this au|thor's Style.</P>
<P>WE need only open any page of Mr. Ad|di&s;on, to &s;ee quite a different order in the con&s;truction of Sentences. <Q REND="inline">"Our &s;ight is the mo&s;t perfect, and mo&s;t delightful of all our &s;en&s;es. It fills the mind with the large&s;t variety of ideas, conver&s;es with its objects at the greate&s;t di&s;tance, and conti|nues the longe&s;t in action, without being tired, or &s;atiated with its proper enjoy|ments. The &s;en&s;e of feeling can, indeed, give us a notion of exten&s;ion, &s;hape, and
<PB N="281" REF="287">
all other ideas that enter at the eye, except colours; but, at the &s;ame time, it is very much &s;traitened and confined in its opera|tions," &amp;c. <BIBL>(Spectator, No. 411.)</BIBL></Q>   In this &s;train, he always proceeds, following the mo&s;t natural and obvious order of the Language: and if, by this means, he has le&s;s pomp and maje&s;ty than Shaft&s;bury, he has, in return, more nature, more ea&s;e and &s;implicity; which are beauties of a higher order.</P>
<P>BUT whether we practi&s;e inver&s;ion or not, and in whatever part of the &s;entence we di&s;|po&s;e of the capital words, it is always a point of great moment, that the&s;e capital words &s;hall &s;tand clear and di&s;entangled from any other words that would clog them. Thus, when there are any circum&s;tances of time, place, or other limitations, which the prin|cipal object of our Sentence requires to have connected with it, we mu&s;t take e&s;pecial care to di&s;po&s;e of them, &s;o as not to cloud that principal object, nor to bury it under a load of circum&s;tances. This will be made clearer by an example. Ob&s;erve the arrangement of the following Sentence, in Lord Shaft&s;bury's Advice to an Author. He is &s;peaking of modern poets, as compared with the anti|ent: <Q REND="inline">"If, whil&s;t they profe&s;s only to plea&s;e, they &s;ecretly advi&s;e, and give in&s;truction, they may now, perhaps, as well as former|ly, be e&s;teemed, with ju&s;tice, the be&s;t and mo&s;t honourable among authors."</Q> This is a well-con&s;tructed Sentence. It contains a
<PB N="282" REF="288">
great many circum&s;tances and adverbs, ne|ce&s;&s;ary to qualify the meaning; <HI>only, &s;ecretly, as well, perhaps, now, with ju&s;tice, formerly;</HI> yet the&s;e are placed with &s;o much art, as neither to embarra&s;s, nor weaken the Sen|tence; while that which is the capital object in it, viz. <Q REND="inline">"Poets being ju&s;tly e&s;teemed the be&s;t and mo&s;t honourable among authors,"</Q> comes out in the conclu&s;ion clear and detach|ed, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es its proper place. See, now, what would have been the effect of a differ|ent arrangement. Suppo&s;e him to have placed the members of the Sentence thus: <Q REND="inline">"If, whil&s;t they profe&s;s to plea&s;e only, they advi&s;e and give in&s;truction &s;ecretly, they may be e&s;teemed the be&s;t and mo&s;t ho|nourable among authors, with ju&s;tice, per|haps, now, as well as formerly."</Q> Here we have preci&s;ely the &s;ame words, and the &s;ame &s;en&s;e; but, by means of the circum&s;tances being &s;o intermingled as to clog the capital words, the whole becomes perplexed, with|out grace, and without &s;trength.</P>
<P>A FOURTH rule, for con&s;tructing Sentences with proper &s;trength, is, to make the mem|bers of them go on ri&s;ing and growing in their importance above one another. This &s;ort of arrangement is called a Climax, and is always con&s;idered as a beauty in compo&s;ition. From what cau&s;e it plea&s;es, is abundantly evident. In all things, we naturally love to a&s;cend to what is more and more beautiful, rather than to follow the retrograde order. Having had
<PB N="283" REF="289">
once &s;ome con&s;iderable object &s;et before us, it is, with pain, we are pulled back to attend to an inferior circum&s;tance. <Q REND="inline">"Cavendum e&s;t,"</Q> &s;ays Quinctilian, who&s;e authority I always willingly quote, <Q REND="inline">"ne decre&s;cat oratio, &amp; fortiori &s;ubjungatur aliquid infirmius; &s;icut, &s;acrilego, fur; aut latroni petulans. Augeri enim debent &s;ententiae &amp; in&s;ur|gere<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Care mu&s;t be taken, that our compo&s;ition &s;hall not fall off, and that a weaker expre&s;&s;ion &s;hall not follow one of more &s;trength; as if, after &s;acrilege, we &s;hould bring in theft; or, having mentioned a robbery, we &s;hould &s;ubjoin petulance. Sentences ought always to ri&s;e and grow."</Q></NOTE>.</Q> Of this beauty, in the con&s;truc|tion of Sentences, the orations of Cicero fur|ni&s;h many examples. His pompous manner naturally led him to &s;tudy it; and, generally, in order to render the climax perfect, he makes both the &s;en&s;e and the &s;ound ri&s;e to|gether, with a very magnificent &s;well. So in his oration for Milo, &s;peaking of a de&s;ign of Clodius's for a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating Pompey: <Q REND="inline">"Atqui &s;i res, &s;i vir, &s;i tempus ullum dignum fuit, cert&egrave; haec in ill&acirc; cau&s;&acirc; &s;umma omnia fue|runt. In&s;idiator erat in Foro collocatus, atque in Ve&s;tibulo ip&s;o Senat&ucirc;s; ei' viro autem mors parabatur, cujus in vit&acirc; nite|batur &s;alus civitatis; eo porr&ograve; reipublicae tempore, quo &s;i unus ille occidi&s;&s;et, non haec &s;ol&ugrave;m civitas, &s;ed gentes omnes con|cidi&s;&s;ent."</Q> The following in&s;tance, from Lord Bolingbroke, is al&s;o beautiful: <Q REND="inline">"This decency, this grace, this propriety of man|ners to character, is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to princes
<PB N="284" REF="290">
in particular, that, whenever it is neglect|ed, their virtues lo&s;e a great degree of lu&s;|tre, and their defects acquire much aggra|vation. Nay more; by neglecting this de|cency and this grace, and for want of a &s;ufficient regard to appearances, even their virtues may betray them into failings, their failings into vices, and their vices into ha|bits unworthy of princes, and unworthy of men." <BIBL>(Idea of a Patriot King.)</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>I MUST ob&s;erve, however, that this &s;ort of full and oratorial climax, can neither be always obtained, nor ought to be always &s;ought after. Only &s;ome kinds of writing admit &s;uch &s;entences; and, to &s;tudy them too frequently, e&s;pecially if the &s;ubject require not &s;o much pomp, is affected and di&s;agree|able. But there is &s;omething approaching to a climax, which it is a general rule to &s;tudy, <Q REND="inline">"ne decre&s;cat oratio,"</Q> as Quinctilian &s;peaks, <Q REND="inline">"et ne fortiori &s;ubjungatur aliquid infirmi|us."</Q> A weaker a&s;&s;ertion or propo&s;ition &s;hould never come after a &s;tronger one; and when our &s;entence con&s;i&s;ts of two members, the longe&s;t &s;hould, generally, be the con|cluding one. There is a twofold rea&s;on for this la&s;t direction. Periods, thus divided, are pronounced more ea&s;ily; and the &s;horte&s;t member being placed fir&s;t, we carry it more readily in our memory as we proceed to the &s;econd, and &s;ee the connection of the two more clearly. Thus, to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"when our pa&s;&s;ions have for&s;aken us, we flatter our|&s;elves
<PB N="285" REF="291">
with the belief that we have for&s;aken them,"</Q> is both more graceful and more clear, than to begin with the longe&s;t part of the propo&s;ition: <Q REND="inline">"We flatter our&s;elves with the belief that we have for&s;aken our pa&s;&s;ions, when they have for&s;aken us."</Q> In general, it is always agreeable to find a &s;entence ri&s;ing upon us, and growing in its importance to the very la&s;t word, when this con&s;truction can be managed without affec|tation, or un&s;ea&s;onable pomp. <Q REND="inline">"If we ri&s;e yet higher,"</Q> &s;ays Mr. Addi&s;on, very beautifully, <Q REND="inline">"and con&s;ider the fixed &s;tars as &s;o many oceans of flame, that are each of them attended with a different &s;et of pla|nets; and &s;till di&s;cover new firmaments and new lights, that are &s;unk farther in tho&s;e unfathomable depths of aether; we are lo&s;t in &s;uch a labyrinth of &s;uns and worlds, and confounded with the magni|ficence and immen&s;ity of Nature" <BIBL>(Spect. No. 420).</BIBL></Q> Hence follows clearly,</P>
<P>A FIFTH rule for the &s;trength of &s;entences; which is, to avoid concluding them with an adverb, a prepo&s;ition, or any incon&s;iderable word. Such conclu&s;ions are always enfee|bling and degrading. There are &s;entences, indeed, where the &s;tre&s;s and &s;ignificancy re&s;t chiefly upon &s;ome words of this kind. In this ca&s;e, they are not to be con&s;idered as cir|cum&s;tances, but as the capital figures; and ought, in propriety, to have the principal place allotted them. No fault, for in&s;tance,
<PB N="286" REF="292">
can be found with this &s;entence of Boling|broke's: <Q REND="inline">"In their pro&s;perity, my friends &s;hall never hear of me; in their adver&s;ity, always."</Q> Where <HI>never,</HI> and <HI>always,</HI> being emphatical words, were to be &s;o placed, as to make a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion. But I &s;peak now of tho&s;e inferior parts of &s;peech, when introduced as circum&s;tances, or as qualifica|tions of more important words. In &s;uch ca&s;e, they &s;hould always be di&s;po&s;ed of in the lea&s;t con&s;picuous parts of the period; and &s;o cla&s;&s;ed with other words of greater dignity, as to be kept in their proper &s;econd|ary &s;tation.</P>
<P>AGREEABLY to this rule, we &s;hould al|ways avoid concluding with any of tho&s;e particles, which mark the ca&s;es of nouns,&mdash;<HI>of, to, from, with, by.</HI> For in&s;tance, it is a great deal better to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Avarice is a crime of which wi&s;e men are often guilty,"</Q> than to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Avarice is a crime which wi&s;e men are often guilty of."</Q> This is a phra&s;eology which all correct writers &s;hun; and with rea&s;on. For, be&s;ides the want of dignity which ari&s;es from tho&s;e mono&s;yllables at the end, the imagination cannot avoid re&s;ting, for a little, on the import of the word which clo&s;es the &s;entence. And, as tho&s;e prepo|&s;itions have no import of their own, but on|ly &s;erve to point out the relations of other words, it is di&s;agreeable for the mind to be left pau&s;ing on a word, which does not, by
<PB N="287" REF="293">
it&s;elf, produce any idea, nor form any picture in the fancy.</P>
<P>FOR the &s;ame rea&s;on, verbs which are u&s;ed in a compound &s;en&s;e, with &s;ome of the&s;e prepo&s;itions, are, though not &s;o bad, yet &s;till not &s;o beautiful conclu&s;ions of a period; &s;uch as, <HI>bring about, lay hold of, come over to, clear up,</HI> and many other of this kind: in|&s;tead of which, if we can employ a &s;imple verb, it always terminates the &s;entence with more &s;trength. Even the pronoun, <HI>It,</HI> though it has the import of a &s;ub&s;tantive noun, and indeed often forces it&s;elf upon us unavoida|bly, yet, when we want to give dignity to a &s;entence, &s;hould, if po&s;&s;ible, be avoided in the conclu&s;ion; more e&s;pecially, when it is joined with &s;ome of the prepo&s;itions, as, <HI>with it, in it, to it.</HI> In the following &s;en|tence of the Spectator, which otherwi&s;e is abundantly noble, the bad effect of this clo&s;e is &s;en&s;ible: <Q REND="inline">"There is not, in my opinion, a more plea&s;ing and triumphant con&s;idera|tion in religion, than this, of the perpetual progre&s;s which the &s;oul makes towards the perfection of its nature, without ever ar|riving at a period in it." <BIBL>(No. III.)</BIBL></Q> How much more graceful the &s;entence, if it had been &s;o con&s;tructed as to clo&s;e with the word, <HI>period!</HI></P>
<P>BESIDES particles and pronouns, any phra&s;e, which expre&s;&s;es a circum&s;tance on|ly, always brings up the rear of a &s;entence
<PB N="288" REF="294">
with a bad grace. We may judge of this, by the following &s;entence from Lord Boling|broke (Letter on the State of Parties at the Acce&s;&s;ion of King George I.): <Q REND="inline">"Let me therefore conclude by repeating, that di|vi&s;ion has cau&s;ed all the mi&s;chief we la|ment; that union alone can retrieve it; and that a great advance towards this uni|on, was the coalition of parties, &s;o hap|pily begun, &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully carried on, and of late &s;o unaccountably neglected; to &s;ay no wor&s;e."</Q> This la&s;t phra&s;e, <HI>to &s;ay no wor&s;e,</HI> occa&s;ions a &s;ad falling off at the end; &s;o much the more unhappy, as the re&s;t of the period is conducted after the manner of a climax, which we expect to find growing to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>THE proper di&s;po&s;ition of &s;uch circum|&s;tances in a &s;entence, is often attended with con&s;iderable trouble, in order to adju&s;t them &s;o, as &s;hall con&s;i&s;t equally with the per&s;pi|cuity and the grace of the period. Though nece&s;&s;ary parts, they are, however, like un|&s;hapely &s;tones in a building, which try the &s;kill of an arti&s;t, where to place them with the lea&s;t offence. <Q REND="inline">"Jungantur,"</Q> &s;ays Quinc|tilian, <Q REND="inline">"quo congruunt maxim&egrave;; &s;icut in &s;tructur&acirc; &s;axorum rudium, etiam ip&s;a enor|mitas invenit cui applicari, et in quo po&s;&s;it in&s;i&s;tere<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Let them be in&s;erted wherever the happie&s;t place for them can be found; as, in a &s;tructure compo&s;ed of rough &s;tones, there are always places where the mo&s;t irregular and un&s;hapely may find &s;ome adjacent one to which it can be joined, and &s;ome ba&s;is on which it may re&s;t."</Q></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="295">
THE clo&s;e is always an un&s;uitable place for them. When the &s;en&s;e admits it, the &s;ooner they are di&s;patched, generally &s;peaking, the better; that the more important and &s;ignifi|cant words may po&s;&s;e&s;s the la&s;t place, quite di&s;encumbered. It is a rule, too, never to crowd too many circum&s;tances together, but rather to inter&s;per&s;e them in different parts of the &s;entence, joined with the capital words on which they depend; provided that care be taken, as I before directed, not to clog tho&s;e capital words with them. For in&s;tance, when Dean Swift &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"What I had the honour of mentioning to your Lord&s;hip, &s;ome time ago, in conver&s;ation, was not a new thought." <BIBL>(Letter to the Earl of Oxford.)</BIBL></Q> The&s;e two circum&s;tances, <HI>&s;ometime ago,</HI> and <HI>in conver&s;ation,</HI> which are here put together, would have had a better effect disjoined, thus: <Q REND="inline">"What I had the honour, &s;ometime ago, of mentioning to your Lord&s;hip in conver&s;ation."</Q> And in the following &s;en|tence of Lord Bolingbroke's (Remarks on the Hi&s;tory of England): <Q REND="inline">"A monarchy, limited like ours, may be placed, for aught I know, as it has been often repre&s;ented, ju&s;t in the middle point, from whence a deviation leads, on the one hand, to tyranny, and on the other, to anarchy."</Q> The arrange|ment would have been happier thus: <Q REND="inline">"A
<PB N="290" REF="296">
monarchy, limited like ours, may, for aught I know, be placed, as it has often been repre&s;ented, ju&s;t in the middle point, &amp;c."</Q></P>
<P>I SHALL give only one rule more, relating to the &s;trength of a &s;entence, which is, that in the members of a &s;entence, where two things are compared or contra&s;ted to one an|other; where either a re&s;emblance or an op|po&s;ition is intended to be expre&s;&s;ed; &s;ome re&s;emblance, in the language and con&s;truc|tion, &s;hould be pre&s;erved. For when the things them&s;elves corre&s;pond to each other, we naturally expect to find the words corre|&s;ponding too. We are di&s;appointed when it is otherwi&s;e; and the compari&s;on, or con|tra&s;t, appears more imperfect. Thus, when Lord Bolingbroke &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"The laughers will be for tho&s;e who have mo&s;t wit; the &s;eri|ous part of mankind, for tho&s;e who have mo&s;t rea&s;on on their &s;ide;" <BIBL>(Di&s;&s;ert. on Parties, Pref.)</BIBL></Q> the oppo&s;ition would have been more complete, if he had &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"The laughers will be for tho&s;e who have mo&s;t wit; the &s;erious, for tho&s;e who have mo&s;t rea&s;on on their &s;ide."</Q> The following pa&s;|&s;age from Mr. Pope's Preface to his Homer, fully exemplifies the rule I am now giving: <Q REND="inline">"Homer was the greater genius; Virgil, the better arti&s;t: in the one, we mo&s;t admire the man; in the other, the work. Homer hurries us with a commanding impetuo|&s;ity; Virgil leads us with an attractive
<PB N="291" REF="297">
maje&s;ty. Homer &s;catters with a generous profu&s;ion; Virgil be&s;tows with a careful magnificence. Homer, like the Nile, pours out his riches with a &s;udden overflow; Vir|gil, like a river in its banks, with a con&s;tant &s;tream.&mdash;And when we look upon their machines, Homer &s;eems like his own Ju|piter in his terrors, &s;haking Olympus, &s;cat|tering the lightnings, and firing the hea|vens; Virgil, like the &s;ame Power, in his benevolence, coun&s;elling with the gods, laying plans for empires, and ordering his whole creation."</Q>&mdash;Periods thus con&s;truct|ed, when introduced with propriety, and not returning too often, have a &s;en&s;ible beauty. But we mu&s;t beware of carrying our atten|tion to this beauty too far. It ought only to be occa&s;ionally &s;tudied, when compari&s;on or oppo&s;ition of objects naturally leads to it. If &s;uch a con&s;truction as this be aimed at in all our &s;entences, it betrays into a di&s;agreeable uniformity; produces a regularly returning clink in the period, which tires the ear; and plainly di&s;covers affectation. Among the an|cients, the &s;tyle of I&s;ocrates is faulty in this re&s;pect; and, on that account, by &s;ome of their be&s;t critics, particularly by Diony&s;ius of Halicarna&s;&s;us, he is &s;everely cen&s;ured.</P>
<P>THIS fini&s;hes what I had to &s;ay concern|ing Sentences, con&s;idered, with re&s;pect to their meaning, under the three heads of Per|&s;picuity, Unity, and Strength. It is a &s;ub|ject on which I have in&s;i&s;ted fully, for two
<PB N="292" REF="298">
rea&s;ons: Fir&s;t, becau&s;e it is a &s;ubject, which, by its nature, can be rendered more didactic, and &s;ubjected more to preci&s;e rule, than many other &s;ubjects of critici&s;m; and next, becau&s;e it appears to me of con&s;iderable im|portance and u&s;e.</P>
<P>FOR, though many of tho&s;e attentions, which I have been recommending, may ap|pear minute, yet their effect, upon writing and &s;tyle, is much greater than might, at fir&s;t, be imagined. A &s;entiment which is expre&s;&s;ed in a period, clearly, neatly, and happily ar|ranged, makes always a &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion on the mind, than one that is any how fee|ble or embarra&s;&s;ed. Every one feels this upon a compari&s;on: and if the effect be &s;en|&s;ible in one &s;entence, how much more in a whole di&s;cour&s;e, or compo&s;ition, that is made up of &s;uch Sentences?</P>
<P>THE fundamental rule of the con&s;truction of Sentences, and into which all others might be re&s;olved, undoubtedly is, to communi|cate, in the cleare&s;t and mo&s;t natural order, the ideas which we mean to transfu&s;e into the minds of others. Every arrangement that does mo&s;t ju&s;tice to the &s;en&s;e, and expre&s;&s;es it to mo&s;t advantage, &s;trikes us as beautiful. To this point have tended all the rules I have given. And, indeed, did men always think clearly, and were they, at the &s;ame time, fully ma&s;ters of the Language in which they write, there would be occa&s;ion for few rules.
<PB N="293" REF="299">
Their Sentences would then, of cour&s;e, ac|quire all tho&s;e properties of Preci&s;ion, Unity, and Strength, which I have recommended. For we may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that, whenever we expre&s;s our&s;elves ill, there is, be&s;ides the mi&s;|management of Language, for the mo&s;t part, &s;ome mi&s;take in our manner of conceiving the &s;ubject. Embarra&s;&s;ed, ob&s;cure, and fee|ble Sentences, are generally, if not always, the re&s;ult of embarra&s;&s;ed, ob&s;cure, and fee|ble thought. Thought and Language act and re-act upon each other mutually. Logic and Rhetoric have here, as in many other ca&s;es, a &s;trict connection; and he that is learning to arrange his &s;entences with accuracy and or|der, is learning, at the &s;ame time, to think with accuracy and order; an ob&s;ervation which alone will ju&s;tify all the care and at|tention we have be&s;towed on this &s;ubject.</P>

<P>SOUND is a quality much inferior to &s;en&s;e; yet &s;uch as mu&s;t not be di&s;regarded.

<P>FIRST, Let us con&s;ider agreeable &s;ound, in general, as the property of a well-con|&s;tructed Sentence: and, as it was of pro&s;e
<PB N="296" REF="302">
Sentences we have hitherto treated, we &s;hall confine our&s;elves to them under this head. This beauty of mu&s;ical con&s;truction in pro&s;e, it is plain will depend upon two things; the choice of words, and the arrangement of them.</P>
<P>I BEGIN with the choice of words; on which head, there is not much to be &s;aid, unle&s;s I were to de&s;cend into a tedious and frivolous detail concerning the powers of the &s;everal letters, or &s;imple &s;ounds, of which &s;peech is compo&s;ed. It is evident, that words are mo&s;t agreeable to the ear which are com|po&s;ed of &s;mooth and liquid &s;ounds, where there is a proper intermixture of vowels and con&s;onants; without too many har&s;h con|&s;onants rubbing again&s;t each other; or too many open vowels in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, to cau&s;e a hiatus, or di&s;agreeable aperture of the mouth. It may always be a&s;&s;umed as a principle, that, whatever &s;ounds are difficult in pronunciati|on, are, in the &s;ame proportion, har&s;h and painful to the ear. Vowels give &s;oftne&s;s; con&s;onants, &s;trength to the &s;ound of words. The mu&s;ic of Language requires a ju&s;t pro|portion of both; and will be hurt, will be rendered either grating or effeminate, by an exce&s;s of either. Long words are commonly more agreeable to the ear than mono&s;ylla|bles. They plea&s;e it by the compo&s;ition, or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;ounds which they pre&s;ent to it; and, accordingly, the mo&s;t mu&s;ical Lan|guages abound mo&s;t in them. Among words
<PB N="297" REF="303">
of any length, tho&s;e are the mo&s;t mu&s;ical, which do not run wholly either upon long or &s;hort &s;yllables, but are compo&s;ed of an inter|mixture of them; &s;uch as, <HI>repent, produce, velocity, celerity, independent, impetuo&s;ity.</HI></P>
<P>THE next head, re&s;pecting the Harmony which re&s;ults from a proper arrangement of the words and members of a period, is more complex, and of greater nicety. For, let the words them&s;elves be ever &s;o well cho&s;en, and well &s;ounding, yet, if they be ill di&s;po&s;ed, the mu&s;ic of the Sentence is utterly lo&s;t. In the harmonious &s;tructure and di&s;po&s;ition of periods, no writer whatever, antient or mo|dern, equals Cicero. He had &s;tudied this with care; and was fond, perhaps to exce&s;s, of what he calls, the <Q REND="inline">"Plena ac numero&s;a oratio."</Q> We need only open his writings, to find in&s;tances that will render the effect of mu&s;ical Language &s;en&s;ible to every ear. What, for example, can be more full, round, and &s;welling, than the following &s;entence of the 4th Oration again&s;t Catiline? <Q REND="inline">"Cogi|tate quantis laboribus fundatum imperium, quant&acirc; virtute &s;tabilitam libertatem, quan|t&acirc; Deorum benignitate auctas exaggerata&s;|que fortunas, una nox pene delerit."</Q> In Engli&s;h, we may take, for an in&s;tance of a mu&s;ical Sentence, the following from Milton, in his Treati&s;e on Education: <Q REND="inline">"We &s;hall conduct you to a hill-&s;ide, laborious, in|deed, at the fir&s;t a&s;cent; but el&s;e, &s;o &s;mooth, &s;o green, &s;o full of goodly pro&s;pects, and
<PB N="298" REF="304">
melodious &s;ounds on every &s;ide, that the harp of Orpheus was not more charming."</Q> Every thing in this &s;entence con&s;pires to pro|mote the harmony. The words are happily cho&s;en; full of liquids and &s;oft &s;ounds; <HI>la|borious, &s;mooth, green, goodly, melodious, charm|ing:</HI> and the&s;e words &s;o artfully arranged, that, were we to alter the collocation of any one of them, we &s;hould, pre&s;ently, be &s;en&s;ible of the melody &s;uffering. For, let us ob&s;erve, how finely the members of the period &s;well one above another. <Q REND="inline">"So &s;mooth, &s;o green,"&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline">"&s;o full of goodly pro&s;pects,&mdash;and melodi|ous &s;ounds on every &s;ide;"</Q>&mdash;till the ear, prepared by this gradual ri&s;e, is conducted to that full clo&s;e on which it re&s;ts with plea|&s;ure;&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"that the harp of Orpheus was not more charming."</Q></P>
<P>THE &s;tructure of periods, then, being &s;u&s;|ceptible of a melody very &s;en&s;ible to the ear, our next enquiry &s;hould be, How this melo|dious &s;tructure is formed, what are the prin|ciples of it, and by what laws is it regulated? And, upon this &s;ubject, were I to follow the antient rhetoricians, it would be ea&s;y to give a great variety of rules. For here they have entered into a minute and particular detail; more particular, indeed, than on any other head that regards Language. They hold, that to pro&s;e as well as to ver&s;e, there belong certain numbers, le&s;s &s;trict, indeed, yet &s;uch as can be a&s;certained by rule. They go &s;o far as to &s;pecify the feet, as they are called,
<PB N="299" REF="305">
that is, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of long and &s;hort &s;yl|lables, which &s;hould enter into the different members of a Sentence, and to &s;how what the effect of each of the&s;e will be. Where|ever they treat of the Structure of Sentences, it is always the mu&s;ic of them that makes the principal object. Cicero and Quinctilian are full of this. The other qualities of Preci&s;i|on, Unity, and Strength, which we con&s;ider as of chief importance, they handle &s;lightly; but when they come to the <Q REND="inline">"<HI>junctura et nu|merus,</HI>"</Q> the modulation and harmony, there they are copious. Diony&s;ius of Halicarna&s;|&s;us, one of the mo&s;t judicious critics of an|tiquity, has written a treati&s;e on the <HI>Compo|&s;ition of words in a Sentence,</HI> which is altoge|ther confined to their mu&s;ical effect. He makes the excellency of a Sentence to con&s;i&s;t in four things; fir&s;t, in the &s;weetne&s;s of &s;in|gle &s;ounds; &s;econdly, in the compo&s;ition of &s;ounds, that is, the numbers or feet; thirdly, in change or variety of &s;ound; and fourthly, in &s;ound &s;uited to the &s;en&s;e. On all the&s;e points he writes with great accuracy and re|finement; and is very worthy of being con|&s;ulted; though, were one now to write a book on the Structure of Sentences, we &s;hould ex|pect to find the &s;ubject treated of in a more exten&s;ive manner.</P>
<P>IN modern times, this whole &s;ubject of the mu&s;ical &s;tructure of di&s;cour&s;e, it is plain, has been much le&s;s &s;tudied; and, indeed, for &s;e|veral rea&s;ons, can be much le&s;s &s;ubjected to
<PB N="300" REF="306">
rule. The rea&s;ons, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to give, both to ju&s;tify my not following the tract of the antient rhetoricians on this &s;ub|ject, and to &s;how how it has come to pa&s;s, that a part of compo&s;ition, which once made &s;o con&s;picuous a figure, now draws much le&s;s attention.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, the antient Languages, I mean the Greek and the Roman, were much more &s;u&s;ceptible than ours, of the graces and the powers of melody. The quan|tities of their &s;yllables were more fixed and determined; their words were longer, and more &s;onorous; their method of varying the terminations of nouns and verbs, both in|troduced a greater variety of liquid &s;ounds, and freed them from that multiplicity of lit|tle auxiliary words which we are obliged to employ; and, what is of the greate&s;t con&s;e|quence, the inver&s;ions which their Languages allowed, gave them the power of placing their words in whatever order was mo&s;t &s;uit|ed to a mu&s;ical arrangement. All the&s;e were great advantages which they enjoyed above us, for Harmony of Period.</P>
<P>IN the next place, the Greeks and Romans, the former e&s;pecially, were, in truth, much more mu&s;ical nations than we; their genius was more turned to delight in the melody of &s;peech. Mu&s;ic is known to have been a more exten&s;ive art among them than it is with us, more univer&s;ally &s;tudied, and ap|plied
<PB N="301" REF="307">
to a greater variety of objects. Se|veral learned men, particularly the Abb&eacute; du Bos, in his Reflections on Poetry and Paint|ing, have clearly proved, that the theatrical compo&s;itions of the antients, both their tra|gedies and comedies, were &s;et to a kind of mu&s;ic. Whence, the <HI>modos fecit,</HI> and the <HI>Tibiis dextris et &s;ini&s;tris,</HI> prefixed to the edi|tions of Terence's Plays. All &s;ort of decla|mation and public &s;peaking, was carried on by them in a much more mu&s;ical tone than it is among us. It approached to a kind of chanting or recitative. Among the Atheni|ans, there was what was called the Nomic Melody; or a particular mea&s;ure pre&s;cribed to the public officers, in which they were to promulgate the laws to the people; le&s;t, by reading them with improper tones, the laws might be expo&s;ed to contempt. Among the Romans, there is a noted &s;tory of C. Grac|chus, when he was declaiming in public, having a mu&s;ician &s;tanding at his back, in order to give him the proper tones with a pipe or flute. Even when pronouncing tho&s;e terrible tribunitial harangues, by which he inflamed the one half of the citizens of Rome again&s;t the other, this attention to the mu&s;ic of Speech was, in tho&s;e times, it &s;eems, thought nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ucce&s;s. Quinctilian, though he condemns the exce&s;s of this &s;ort of pronunciation, yet allows a <Q REND="inline">"cantus ob|&s;curior"</Q> to be a beauty in a public &s;peaker. Hence, that variety of accents, acute, grave, and circumflex, which we find marked upon
<PB N="302" REF="308">
the Greek &s;yllables, to expre&s;s, not the quan|tity of them, but the tone in which they were to be &s;poken: the application of which is now wholly unknown to us. And though the Romans did not mark tho&s;e accents in their writing, yet it appears, from Quincti|lian, that they u&s;ed them in pronunciation: <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Quantum, quale,</HI>"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">"comparantes gravi, interrogantes acuto tenore conclu|dunt."</Q> As mu&s;ic then, was an object much more attended to in Speech, among the Greeks and Romans, than it is with us; as, in all kinds of public &s;peaking, they employed a much greater variety of notes, of tones, or inflexions of voice, than we u&s;e; this is one clear rea&s;on of their paying a greater atten|tion to that con&s;truction of Sentences, which might be&s;t &s;uit this mu&s;ical pronunciation.</P>
<P>IT is farther known, that, in con&s;equence of the genius of their Languages, and of their manner of pronouncing them, the mu|&s;ical arrangement of Sentences, did, in fact, produce a greater effect in publick &s;peaking among them, than it could po&s;&s;ibly do in any modern oration; another rea&s;on why it de|&s;erved to be more &s;tudied. Cicero, in his treati&s;e, intitled, <HI>Orator,</HI> tells us, <Q REND="inline">"Conciones &s;aepe exclamare vidi, cum verba apt&egrave; ceci|di&s;&s;ent. Id enim expectant aures<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"I have often been witne&s;s to bur&s;ts of exclamation in the public a&s;&s;emblies, when Sentences clo&s;ed mu&s;ically; for that is a plea&s;ure which the ear expects."</Q></NOTE>."</Q> And
<PB N="303" REF="309">
he gives a remarkable in&s;tance of the effect of a harmonious period upon a whole a&s;&s;em|bly, from a Sentence of one of Carbo's Ora|tions, &s;poken in his hearing. The Sentence was, <Q REND="inline">"Patris dictum &s;apiens temeritas filii comprobavit."</Q> By means of the &s;ound of which, alone, he tells us, <Q REND="inline">"Tantus clamor concionis excitatus e&s;t, ut pror&s;us admira|bile e&s;&s;et."</Q> He makes us remark the feet of which the&s;e words con&s;i&s;t, to which he a&s;cribes the power of the melody; and &s;hows how, by altering the collocation, the whole effect would be lo&s;t; as thus: <Q REND="inline">"Patris dic|tum &s;apiens comprobravit temeritas filii."</Q> Now, though it be true that Carbo's Sen|tence is extremely mu&s;ical, and would be agreeable, at this day, to any audience, yet I cannot believe that an Engli&s;h Sentence, equally harmonious, would, by its harmony alone, produce any &s;uch effect on a Briti&s;h audience, or excite any &s;uch wonderful ap|plau&s;e and admiration, as Cicero informs us this of Carbo produced. Our northern ears are too coar&s;e and obtu&s;e. The melody of Speech has le&s;s power over us; and by our &s;impler and plainer method of uttering words, Speech is, in truth, accompanied with le&s;s melody than it was among the Greeks and Romans<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"In ver&s;u quidem, theatra tota exclamant &s;i fuit una &s;yllaba aut brevior aut longior.

<P><PB N="304" REF="310">
FOR the&s;e rea&s;ons, I am of opinion, that it is in vain to think of be&s;towing the &s;ame attention upon the harmonious &s;tructure of our Sentences, that was be&s;towed by the&s;e antient nations. The doctrine of the Greek and Roman critics, on this head, has mi&s;led &s;ome to imagine, that it might be equally applied to our Tongue; and that our pro&s;e writing might be regulated by Spondees and Trochees, and Iambus's and Poeons, and other metrical feet. But, fir&s;t, our words cannot be mea&s;ured, or, at lea&s;t, can be mea&s;ured very imperfectly by any feet of this kind. For, the quantity, the length and &s;hortne&s;s of our &s;yllables, is not, by any means, &s;o fixed and &s;ubjected to rule, as in the Greek and Roman Tongues; but very often left arbitrary, and determined by the empha&s;is, and the &s;en&s;e. Next, though our pro&s;e could admit of &s;uch metrical regulation, yet, from our plainer method of pronouncing all &s;ort of di&s;cour&s;e, the effect would not be at all &s;o &s;en&s;ible to the ear, nor be reli&s;hed with &s;o much plea&s;ure, as among the Greeks and Romans: And, la&s;tly, This whole doctrine about the mea&s;ures and numbers of pro&s;e, even as it is delivered by the antient rheto|ricians them&s;elves, is, in truth, in a great mea&s;ure loo&s;e and uncertain. It appears, in|deed, that the melody of di&s;cour&s;e was a
<PB N="305" REF="311">
matter of infinitely more attention to them, than ever it has been to the moderns. But, though they write a great deal about it, they have never been able to reduce it to any rules which could be of real u&s;e in practice. If we con&s;ult Cicero's <HI>Orator,</HI> where this point is di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with the mo&s;t minutene&s;s, we will &s;ee how much the&s;e antient critics dif|fered from one another, about the feet pro|per for the conclu&s;ion, and other parts of a Sentence; and how much, after all, was left to the judgment of the ear. Nor, indeed, is it po&s;&s;ible to give preci&s;e rules concerning this matter, in any Language; as all pro&s;e compo&s;ition mu&s;t be allowed to run loo&s;e in its numbers; and, according as the tenor of a di&s;cour&s;e varies, the modulation of Sentences mu&s;t vary infinitely.</P>
<P>BUT, although I apprehend, that this mu|&s;ical arrangement cannot be reduced into a &s;y&s;tem, I am far from thinking, that it is a quality to be neglected in compo&s;ition. On the contrary, I hold its effect to be very con|&s;iderable; and that every one who &s;tudies to write with grace, much more, who &s;eeks to pronounce in public, with &s;ucce&s;s, will be obliged to attend to it not a little. But it is his ear, cultivated by attention and practice, that mu&s;t chiefly direct him. For any rules that can be given, on this &s;ubject, are very general. Some rules, however, there are, which may be of u&s;e to form the ear to the proper harmony of di&s;cour&s;e. I proceed
<PB N="306" REF="312">
to mention &s;uch as appear to me mo&s;t mate|rial.</P>
<P>THERE are two things on which the mu|&s;ic of a Sentence chiefly depends. The&s;e are, the proper di&s;tribution of the &s;everal members of it; and, the clo&s;e or cadence of the whole.</P>
<P>FIRST, I &s;ay, the di&s;tribution of the &s;e|veral members is to be carefully attended to. It is of importance to ob&s;erve, that, whatever is ea&s;y and agreeable to the organs of Speech. always &s;ounds grateful to the ear. While a period is going on, the termination of each of its members forms a pau&s;e, or re&s;t, in pronouncing: and the&s;e re&s;ts &s;hould be &s;o di&s;tributed, as to make the cour&s;e of the breathing ea&s;y, and, at the &s;ame time, &s;hould fall at &s;uch di&s;tances, as to bear a certain mu&s;ical proportion to each other. This will be be&s;t illu&s;trated by examples. The follow|ing Sentence is from Archbi&s;hop Tillot&s;on; <Q REND="inline">"This di&s;cour&s;e concerning the ea&s;ine&s;s of God's commands does, all along, &s;uppo&s;e and acknowledge the difficulties of the fir&s;t entrance upon a religious cour&s;e; ex|cept, only in tho&s;e per&s;ons who have had the happine&s;s to be trained up to religion by the ea&s;y and in&s;en&s;ible degrees of a pi|ous and virtuous education."</Q> Here there is no harmony; nay, there is &s;ome degree of har&s;hne&s;s and unplea&s;antne&s;s; owing princi|pally to this, that there is, properly, no more
<PB N="307" REF="313">
than one pau&s;e or re&s;t in the Sentence, fall|ing betwixt the two members into which it is divided; each of which is &s;o long as to oc|ca&s;ion a con&s;iderable &s;tretch of the breath in pronouncing it.</P>
<P>OBSERVE, now, on the other hand, the ea&s;e with which the following Sentence, from Sir William Temple, glides along, and the graceful intervals at which the pau&s;es are placed. He is &s;peaking &s;arca&s;tically of man: <Q REND="inline">"But God be thanked, his pride is greater than his ignorance, and what he wants in knowledge, he &s;upplies by &s;ufficiency. When he has looked about him, as far as he can, he concludes, there is no more to be &s;een; when he is at the end of his line, he is at the bottom of the ocean; when he has &s;hot his be&s;t, he is &s;ure none ever did, or ever can, &s;hoot better, or beyond it. His own rea&s;on he holds to be the certain mea&s;ure of truth; and his own knowledge, of what is po&s;&s;ible in nature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Or this in&s;tance.&mdash;He is addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Lady E&s;&s;ex, upon the death of her child: <Q REND="inline">"I was once in hope, that what was &s;o violent could not be long: But, when I ob|&s;erved your grief to grow &s;tronger with age, and to increa&s;e, like a &s;tream, the farther it ran; when I &s;aw it draw out to &s;uch unhappy con&s;equences, and to threaten, no le&s;s than your child, your health, and your life, I could no longer forbear this endeavour, nor end it, without begging of you, for God's &s;ake, and for your own, for your children, and your friends, your country, and your family, that you would no longer abandon your&s;elf to a di&s;con&s;olate pa&s;&s;ion; but that you would, at length, awaken your piety, give way to your prudence, or, at lea&s;t, rouze the invinci|ble &s;pirit of the Percys, that never yet &s;hrunk at any di&s;|a&s;ter."</Q></NOTE>."</Q> Here every thing is, at once,
<PB N="308" REF="314">
ea&s;y to the breath, and grateful to the ear; and, it is this &s;ort of flowing mea&s;ure, this regular and proportional divi&s;ion of the mem|bers of his Sentences, which renders Sir William Temple's &s;tyle always agreeable. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, at the &s;ame time, that a Sen|tence, with too many re&s;ts, and the&s;e placed at intervals too apparently mea&s;ured and re|gular, is apt to &s;avour of affectation.</P>
<P>THE next thing to be attended to, is, the clo&s;e or cadence of the whole Sentence, which, as it is always the part mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible to the ear, demands the greate&s;t care. So Quinctilian: <Q REND="inline">"Non igitur durum &s;it, neque abruptum, quo animi, velut re&s;pirant ac reficiuntur. Haec e&s;t &s;edes orationis; hoc auditor expectat; his laus omnis decla|mat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Let there be nothing ra&s;h or abrupt in the conclu&s;ion of the &s;entence, on which the mind pau&s;es and re&s;ts. This is the mo&s;t material part in the &s;tructure of Di&s;cour&s;e. Here every hearer expects to be gratified; here his applau&s;e breaks forth."</Q></NOTE>."</Q> The only important rule that can be given here, is, that when we aim at dig|nity or elevation, the &s;ound &s;hould be made to grow to the la&s;t; the longe&s;t members of the period, and the fulle&s;t and mo&s;t &s;onorous words, &s;hould be re&s;erved to the conclu&s;ion. As an example of this, the following &s;entence of Mr. Addi&s;on's may be given: <Q REND="inline">"It fills
<PB N="309" REF="315">
the mind (&s;peaking of &s;ight) with the large&s;t variety of ideas; conver&s;es with its objects at the greate&s;t di&s;tance; and con|tinues the longe&s;t in action, without being tired or &s;atiated with its proper enjoy|ments."</Q> Every reader mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of a beauty here, both in the proper divi&s;ion of the members and pau&s;es, and the manner in which the Sentence is rounded, and conduct|ed to a full and harmonious clo&s;e.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame holds in melody, that I ob&s;erv|ed to take place with re&s;pect to &s;ignificancy; that a falling off at the end, always hurts greatly. For this rea&s;on, particles, pronouns, and little words, are as ungracious to the ear, at the conclu&s;ion, as I formerly &s;hewed they were incon&s;i&s;tent with &s;trength of expre&s;&s;ion. It is more than probable, that the &s;en&s;e and the &s;ound have here a mutual influence on each other. That which hurts the ear, &s;eems to mar the &s;trength of the meaning; and that which really degrades the &s;en&s;e, in con|&s;equence of this primary effect, appears al&s;o to have a bad &s;ound. How di&s;agreeable is the following &s;entence of an Author, &s;peak|ing of the Trinity! <Q REND="inline">"It is a my&s;tery which we firmly believe the truth of, and hum|bly adore the depth of."</Q> And how ea&s;ily could it have been mended by this tran&s;po&s;i|tion! <Q REND="inline">"It is a my&s;tery, the truth of which we firmly believe, and the depth of which we humbly adore."</Q> In general it &s;eems to hold, that a mu&s;ical clo&s;e, in our language,
<PB N="310" REF="316">
requires either the la&s;t &s;yllable, or the penult, that is, the la&s;t but one, to be a long &s;yllable. Words which con&s;i&s;t mo&s;tly of &s;hort &s;yllables, as, <HI>contrary, particular, retro&s;pect,</HI> &s;eldom conclude a &s;entence harmoniou&s;ly, unle&s;s a run of long &s;yllables, before, has rendered them agreeable to the ear.</P>
<P>IT is nece&s;&s;ary, however, to ob&s;erve, that Sentences, &s;o con&s;tructed as to make the &s;ound always &s;well and grow towards the end, and to re&s;t either on a long or a penult long &s;yllable, give a di&s;cour&s;e the tone of decla|mation. The ear &s;oon becomes acquainted with the melody, and is apt to be cloyed with it. If we would keep up the attention of the reader or hearer, if we would pre&s;erve vivacity and &s;trength in our compo&s;ition, we mu&s;t be very attentive to vary our mea&s;ures. This regards the di&s;tribution of the members, as well as the cadence of the period. Sen|tences con&s;tructed in a &s;imilar manner, with the pau&s;es falling at equal intervals, &s;hould never follow one another. Short Sentences &s;hould be intermixed with long and &s;welling ones, to render di&s;cour&s;e &s;prightly, as well as magnificent. Even di&s;cords, properly in|troduced, abrupt &s;ounds, departures from re|gular cadence, have &s;ometimes a good effect. Monotony is the great fault into which wri|ters are apt to fall, who are fond of harmo|nious arrangement: and to have only one tune, or mea&s;ure, is not much better than having none at all. A very vulgar ear will

enable a writer to catch &s;ome one melody, and to form the run of his Sentences accord|ing to it; which &s;oon proves di&s;gu&s;ting. But a ju&s;t and correct ear is requi&s;ite for varying and diver&s;ifying the melody: and hence we &s;o &s;eldom meet with authors, who are re|markably happy in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P>THOUGH attention to the mu&s;ic of Sen|tences mu&s;t not be neglected, yet it mu&s;t al&s;o be kept within proper bounds: for all appearances of an author's affecting harmony, are di&s;agreeable; e&s;pecially when the love of it betrays him &s;o far, as to &s;acrifice, in any in&s;tance, per&s;picuity, preci&s;ion, or &s;trength of &s;entiment, to &s;ound. All unmeaning words, introduced merely to round the period, or fill up the melody, <HI>complementa numerorum,</HI> as Cicero calls them, are great blemi&s;hes in writ|ing. They are childi&s;h and puerile orna|ments, by which a Sentence always lo&s;es more in point of weight, than it can gain by &s;uch additions to the beauty of its &s;ound Sen&s;e has its own harmony, as well as &s;ound; and, where the &s;en&s;e of a period is expre&s;&s;ed with clearne&s;s, force, and dignity, it will &s;eldom happen but the words will &s;trike the ear agreeably; at lea&s;t, a very moderate atten|tion is all that is requi&s;ite for making the ca|dence of &s;uch a period plea&s;ing: and the ef|fect of greater attention is often no other, than to render compo&s;ition languid and ener|vated. After all the labour which Quinctilian be&s;tows on regulating the mea&s;ures of pro&s;e,

<P>CICERO, as I before ob&s;erved, is one of the mo&s;t remarkable patterns of a harmoni|ous &s;tyle. His love of it, however, is too vi&s;ible; and the pomp of his numbers &s;ome|times detracts from his &s;trength. That noted clo&s;e of his, <HI>e&s;&s;e videatur,</HI> which, in the Ora|tion Pro Lege Manilia, occurs eleven times, expo&s;ed him to cen&s;ure among his cotempora|ries. We mu&s;t ob&s;erve, hewever, in defence of this great Orator, that there is a remarka|ble union in his &s;tyle, of harmony with ea&s;e, which is always a great beauty; and if his harmony be &s;ometimes thought &s;tudied, that &s;tudy appears to have co&s;t him little trou|ble.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="319">
AMONG our Engli&s;h cla&s;&s;ics, not many are di&s;tingui&s;hed for mu&s;ical arrangement. Mil|ton, in &s;ome of his pro&s;e works, has very finely turned periods; but the writers of his age indulged a liberty of inver&s;ion, which now would be reckoned contrary to purity of &s;tyle: and though this allowed their Sen|tences to be more &s;tately and &s;onorous, yet it gave them too much of a Latinized con|&s;truction and order. Of later writers, Shaft&s;|bury is, upon the whole, the mo&s;t correct in his numbers. As his ear was delicate, he has attended to mu&s;ic in all his Sentences; and he is peculiarly happy in this re&s;pect, that he has avoided the monotony into which writ|ers, who &s;tudy the grace of &s;ound, are very apt to fall: having diver&s;ified his periods with great variety. Mr. Addi&s;on has al&s;o much harmony in his &s;tyle; more ea&s;y and &s;mooth, but le&s;s varied, than Lord Shaft&s;bu|ry. Sir William Temple is, in general, very flowing and agreeable. Archbi&s;hop Tillot&s;on is too often carele&s;s and languid; and is much outdone by Bi&s;hop Atterbury in the mu&s;ic of his periods. Dean Swift de&s;pi&s;ed mu&s;ical ar|rangement altogether.</P>
<P>HITHER TO I have di&s;cour&s;ed of agreeable &s;ound, or modulation, in general. It yet re|mains to treat of a higher beauty of this kind; the &s;ound adapted to the &s;en&s;e. The former was no more than a &s;imple accom|paniment, to plea&s;e the ear; the latter &s;up|po&s;es a peculiar expre&s;&s;ion given to the mu|&s;ic.
<PB N="314" REF="320">
We may remark two degrees of it: Fir&s;t, the current of &s;ound, adapted to the tenor of a di&s;cour&s;e; next, a particular re&s;emblance effected between &s;ome object, and the &s;ounds that are employed in de&s;cribing it.</P>
<P>FIRST, I &s;ay, the current of &s;ound may be adapted to the tenor of a di&s;cour&s;e. Sounds have, in many re&s;pects, a corre&s;pondence with our ideas; partly natural, partly the effect of artificial a&s;&s;ociations. Hence it hap|pens, that any one modulation of &s;ound con|tinued, imprints on our Style a certain cha|racter and expre&s;&s;ion. Sentences con&s;truct|ed with the Ciceronian fulne&s;s and &s;well, pro|duce the impre&s;&s;ion of what is important, magnificent, &s;edate. For this is the natural tone which &s;uch a cour&s;e of &s;entiment a&s;|&s;umes. But they &s;uit no violent pa&s;&s;ion, no eager rea&s;oning, no familiar addre&s;s. The&s;e always require mea&s;ures bri&s;ker, ea&s;ier, and often more abrupt. And, therefore, to &s;well, or to let down the periods, as the &s;ubject de|mands, is a very important rule in oratory. No one tenor whatever, &s;uppo&s;ing it to pro|duce no bad effect from &s;atiety, will an&s;wer to all different compo&s;itions; nor even to all the parts of the &s;ame compo&s;ition. It were as ab&s;urd to write a panegyric, and an invec|tive, in a Style of the &s;ame cadence, as to &s;et the words of a tender love-&s;ong to the air of a warlike march.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="321">
OBSERVE how finely the following &s;en|tence of Cicero is adapted, to repre&s;ent the tranquillity and ea&s;e of a &s;atisfied &s;tate: <Q REND="inline">"Et&s;i homini nihil e&s;t magis optandum quam pro&s;pera, aequabilis, perpetuaque fortuna, &s;ecundo vitae &s;ine ulla offen&s;ione cur&s;u; tamen, &s;i mihi tranquilla et placata omnia fui&s;&s;ent, incredibili qu&acirc;dam et pene divin&acirc;, qu&acirc; nunc ve&s;tro beneficio fruor, laetitiae vo|luptate carui&s;&s;em<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orat. ad Quirites, po&s;t Reditum.</NOTE>."</Q> Nothing was ever more perfect in its kind: it paints, if we may &s;o &s;peak, to the ear. But, who would not have laughed, if Cicero had employed &s;uch periods, or &s;uch a cadence as this, in inveighing again&s;t Mark Antony, or Cati|line? What is requi&s;ite, therefore, is, that we previou&s;ly fix, in our mind, a ju&s;t idea of the general tone of &s;ound which &s;uits our &s;ubject; that is, which the &s;entiments we are to expre&s;s, mo&s;t naturally a&s;&s;ume, and in which they mo&s;t commonly vent them|&s;elves; whether round and &s;mooth, or &s;tate|ly and &s;olemn, or bri&s;k and quick, or inter|rupted and abrupt. This general idea mu&s;t direct the run of our compo&s;ition; to &s;peak in the &s;tyle of mu&s;ic, mu&s;t give us the key note, mu&s;t form the ground of the melody; varied and diver&s;ified in parts, according as either our &s;entiments are diver&s;ified, or as is requi&s;ite for producing a &s;uitable variety to gratify the car.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="322">
IT may be proper to remark, that our tran&s;lators of the Bible have often been hap|py in &s;uiting their numbers to the &s;ubject. Grave, &s;olemn, and maje&s;tic &s;ubjects un|doubtedly require &s;uch an arrangement of words as runs much on long &s;yllables; and, particularly, they require the clo&s;e to re&s;t upon &s;uch. The very fir&s;t ver&s;es of the Bi|ble, are remarkable for this melody: <Q REND="inline">"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth; and the earth was without form, and void; and darkne&s;s was upon the face of the deep; and the Spirit of God moved on the face of the waters."</Q> Several other pa&s;&s;ages, particularly &s;ome of the P&s;alms, afford &s;triking examples of this &s;ort of grave, melodious con&s;truction. Any compo&s;ition that ri&s;es con&s;iderably above the ordinary tone of pro&s;e, &s;uch as monumental in&s;cripti|ons, and panegyrical characters, naturally runs into numbers of this kind.</P>
<P>BUT, in the next place, be&s;ides the gene|ral corre&s;pondence of the current of &s;ound with the current of thought, there may be a more particular expre&s;&s;ion attempted, of certain objects, by means of re&s;embling &s;ounds. This can be, &s;ometimes, accom|pli&s;hed in pro&s;e compo&s;ition; but there only in a more faint degree; nor is it &s;o much ex|pected there. In poetry, chiefly, it is look|ed for; where attention to &s;ound is more demanded, and where the inver&s;ions and li|berties of poetical &s;tyle give us a greater
<PB N="317" REF="323">
command of &s;ound; a&s;&s;i&s;ted, too, by the ver|&s;ification, and that <HI>cantus ob&s;curior,</HI> to which we are naturally led in reading poetry. This requires a little more illu&s;tration.</P>
<P>THE &s;ounds of words may be employed for repre&s;enting, chiefly, three cla&s;&s;es of ob|jects; fir&s;t, other &s;ounds; &s;econdly, motion; and, thirdly, the emotions and pa&s;&s;ions of the mind.</P>
<P>FIRST, I &s;ay, by a proper choice of words, we may produce a re&s;emblance of other &s;ounds which we mean to de&s;cribe, &s;uch as, the noi&s;e of waters, the roaring of winds, or the murmuring of &s;treams. This is the &s;imple&s;t in&s;tance of this &s;ort of beauty. For the medium through which we imitate, here, is a natural one; &s;ounds repre&s;ented by other &s;ounds; and between ideas of the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, it is ea&s;y to form a connection. No very great art is required in a poet, when he is de&s;cribing &s;weet and &s;oft &s;ounds, to make u&s;e of &s;uch words as have mo&s;t liquids and vowels, and glide the &s;ofte&s;t; or, when he is de&s;cribing har&s;h &s;ounds, to throw together a number of har&s;h &s;yllables which are of difficult pronunciation. Here the common &s;tructure of Language a&s;&s;i&s;ts him; for, it will be found, that, in mo&s;t Languages, the names of many particular &s;ounds are &s;o form|ed, as to carry &s;ome affinity to the &s;ound which they &s;ignify; as with us, the <HI>whi&s;tling</HI> of winds, the <HI>buz</HI> and <HI>hum</HI> of in&s;ects, the
<PB N="318" REF="324">
<HI>hi&s;s</HI> of &s;erpents, the <HI>cra&s;h</HI> of falling timber; and many other in&s;tances, where the word has been plainly framed upon the &s;ound it repre&s;ents. I &s;hall produce a remarkable example of this beauty from Milton, taken from two pa&s;&s;ages in Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, de&s;crib|ing the &s;ound made, in the one, by the open|ing of the gates of Hell; in the other, by the opening of tho&s;e of Heaven. The contra&s;t between the two, di&s;plays, to great advan|tage, the poet's art. The fir&s;t is the open|ing of Hell's gates:<Q><L>&mdash;On a &s;udden, open fly,</L>
<L>With impetuous recoil, and jarring &s;ound,</L>
<L>Th' infernal doors; and on their hinges grate</L>
<L>Har&s;h thunder.&mdash;</L><BIBL>B. I.</BIBL></Q> Ob&s;erve, now, the &s;moothne&s;s of the other:<Q><L>&mdash;Heaven opened wide</L>
<L>Her ever-during gates, harmonious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ound,</L>
<L>On golden hinges turning.&mdash;</L><BIBL>B. II.</BIBL></Q> The following beautiful pa&s;&s;age from Ta&s;&s;o's Gieru&s;alemme, has been often admired, on account of the imitation effected by &s;ound of the thing repre&s;ented:<Q><L>Chiama gli habitator de l'ombre eterne</L>
<L>Il rauco &s;uon de la Tartarea tromba:</L>
<L>Treman le &s;pacio&s;e atre caverne,</L>
<L>Et l'aer cieco a quel rumor rimbomba;</L>
<L>Ni &s;tridendo co&s;i de la &s;uperne.</L>
<L>Regioni dele cielo, il folgor piomba;</L>

<L>Quand i vapori in &s;en gravida &s;erra.</L>
<BIBL>CANT. IV. Stanz. 4.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>THE &s;econd cla&s;s of objects, which the &s;ound of words is often employed to imitate, is, Motion; as it is &s;wift or &s;low, violent or gentle, equable or interrupted, ea&s;y or ac|companied with effort. Though there be no natural affinity between &s;ound, of any kind, and motion, yet, in the imagination, there is a &s;trong one; as appears from the connection between mu&s;ic and dancing. And, there|fore, here it is in the poet's power to give us a lively idea of the kind of motion he would de&s;cribe, by means of &s;ounds which corre&s;pond, in our imagination, with that motion. Long &s;yllables naturally give the impre&s;&s;ion of &s;low motion; as in this line of Virgil:<Q><L>Olli inter &s;e&s;e magna vi brachia tollunt.</L></Q> A &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;hort &s;yllables pre&s;ents quick motion to the mind; as,<Q><L>Quadrupedante putrem &s;onitu quatit ungula campum.</L></Q></P>
<P>BOTH Homer and Virgil are great ma&s;ters of this beauty; and their works abound with in&s;tances of it; mo&s;t of them, indeed, &s;o often quoted, and &s;o well known, that it is needle&s;s to produce them. I &s;hall give one in&s;tance, in Engli&s;h, which &s;eems happy. It
<PB N="320" REF="326">
is the de&s;cription of a &s;udden calm on the &s;eas, in a Poem, entitled, <HI>The Fleece.</HI><Q><L>&mdash;With ea&s;y cour&s;e</L>
<L>The ve&s;&s;els glide; unle&s;s their &s;peed be &s;topp'd</L>

<L>The downy feather, on the cordage hung,</L>
<L>Moves not; the flat &s;ea &s;hines like yellow gold</L>
<L>Fus'd in the fire, or like the marble floor</L>
<L>Of &s;ome old temple wide.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>THE third &s;et of objects, which I menti|oned the &s;ound of words as capable of re|pre&s;enting, con&s;i&s;ts of the pa&s;&s;ions and emo|tions of the mind. Sound may, at fir&s;t view, appear foreign to the&s;e; but, that here, al&s;o, there is &s;ome &s;ort of connection, is &s;ufficient|ly proved by the power which mu&s;ic has to awaken, or to a&s;&s;i&s;t certain pa&s;&s;ions, and, according as its &s;train is varied, to introduce one train of ideas, rather than another. This, indeed, logically &s;peaking, cannot be called a re&s;emblance between the &s;en&s;e and the &s;ound, &s;eeing long or &s;hort &s;yllables have no natural re&s;emblance to any thought or pa&s;|&s;ion. But if the arrangement of &s;yllables, by their &s;ound alone, recal one &s;et of ideas more readily than another, and di&s;po&s;e the mind for entering into that affection which the poet means to rai&s;e, &s;uch arrangement may, ju&s;tly enough, be &s;aid to re&s;emble the &s;en&s;e, or be &s;imilar and corre&s;pondent to it. I admit, that, in many in&s;tances, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to di&s;play this beauty of accommo|dation
<PB N="321" REF="327">
of &s;ound to the &s;en&s;e, there is much room for imagination to work; and, accord|ing as a reader is &s;truck by a pa&s;&s;age, he will often fancy a re&s;emblance between the &s;ound and the &s;en&s;e, which others cannot di&s;cover. He modulates the numbers to his own di&s;po|&s;ition of mind; and, in effect, makes the mu&s;ic which he imagines him&s;elf to hear. However, that there are real in&s;tances of this kind, and that poetry is capable of &s;ome &s;uch expre&s;&s;ion, cannot be doubted. Dryden's Ode on St. Cecilia's Day, affords a very beau|tiful exemplification of it, in the Engli&s;h Lan|guage. Without much &s;tudy or reflection, a poet de&s;cribing plea&s;ure, joy, and agreeable objects, from the feeling of his &s;ubject, na|turally runs into &s;mooth, liquid, and flow|ing numbers.<Q><L>&mdash;Namque ip&s;a decoram</L>

<HEAD>LECTURE XIV. ORIGIN AND NATURE OF FIGURA|TIVE LANGUAGE.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING now fini&s;hed what related to the con&s;truction of &s;entences, I proceed to other rules concerning Style. My gene|ral divi&s;ion of the qualities of Style, was in|to Per&s;picuity and Ornament. Per&s;picuity, both in &s;ingle words and in &s;entences, I have con&s;idered. Ornament, as far as it ari&s;es from a graceful, &s;trong, or melodious con|&s;truction of words, has al&s;o been treated of. Another, and a great branch of the orna|ment of Style, is, Figurative Language; which is now to be the &s;ubject of our con&s;i|deration, and will require a full di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Our fir&s;t enquiry mu&s;t be, What is meant by Figures of Speech<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the &s;ubject of Figures of Speech, all the writers who treat of rhetoric or compo&s;ition, have in&s;i&s;ted largely. To make references, therefore, on this &s;ubject, were endle&s;s. On the foundations of Figurative Language, in general, one of the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible and in&s;tructive writers, appears to me, to be M. Mar&s;ais, in his <HI>Trait&eacute; des Tropes pour &s;ervir d' Introduction &agrave; la Rhetorique, &amp; &agrave; la Logique.</HI> For ob&s;ervations on parti|cular Figures, the <HI>Elements of Critici&s;m</HI> may be con&s;ulted, where the &s;ubject is fully handled, and illu&s;trated by a great variety of examples.</NOTE>?</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="330">
IN general, they always imply &s;ome depar|ture from &s;implicity of expre&s;&s;ion; the idea which we intend to convey, not only enun|ciated to others, but enunciated, in a parti|cular manner, and with &s;ome circum&s;tance, added, which is de&s;igned to render the im|pre&s;&s;ion more &s;trong and vivid. When I &s;ay, for in&s;tance, <Q REND="inline">"That a good man enjoys com|fort in the mid&s;t of adver&s;ity;"</Q> I ju&s;t ex|pre&s;s my thought in the &s;imple&s;t manner po&s;|&s;ible. But when I &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"To the upright there ari&s;eth light in darkne&s;s;"</Q> the &s;ame &s;entiment is expre&s;&s;ed in a figurative Style; a new circum&s;tance is introduced; light is put in the place of comfort, and darkne&s;s is u&s;ed to &s;ugge&s;t the idea of adver&s;ity. In the &s;ame manner, to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"It is impo&s;&s;ible, by any &s;earch we can make, to explore the divine nature fully,"</Q> is, to make a &s;imple propo&s;ition. But when we &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Can&s;t thou, by &s;earching, find out God? Can&s;t thou find out the Almighty to perfection? It is high as Heaven, what can&s;t thou do? deeper than Hell, what can&s;t thou know?"</Q> This introduces a figure into Style; the pro|po&s;ition being not only expre&s;&s;ed, but admi|ration
<PB N="325" REF="331">
and a&s;toni&s;hment being expre&s;&s;ed to|gether with it.</P>
<P>BUT, though Figures imply a deviation from what may be reckoned the mo&s;t &s;imple form of Speech, we are not thence to con|clude, that they imply any thing uncommon, or unnatural. This is &s;o far from being the ca&s;e, that, on very many occa&s;ions, they are both the mo&s;t natural, and the mo&s;t common method of uttering our &s;entiments. It is impo&s;&s;ible to compo&s;e any di&s;cour&s;e without u&s;ing them often; nay, there are few Sen|tences of any length, in which &s;ome expre&s;|&s;ion or other, that may be termed a Figure, does not occur. From what cau&s;es this hap|pens, &s;hall be afterwards explained. The fact, in the mean time, &s;hows, that they are to be accounted part of that Language which nature dictates to men. They are not the invention of the &s;chools, nor the mere pro|duct of &s;tudy: on the contrary, the mo&s;t il|literate &s;peak in figures, as often as the mo&s;t learned. Whenever the imaginations of the vulgar are much awakened, or their pa&s;&s;ions inflamed again&s;t one another, they will pour forth a torrent of Figurative Language, as forcible as could be employed by the mo&s;t artifical declaimer.</P>
<P>WHAT then is it, which has drawn the attention of critics and rhetoricians &s;o much to the&s;e forms of Speech? It is this: They remarked, that in them con&s;i&s;ts much of the
<PB N="326" REF="332">
beauty and the force of Language; and found them always to bear &s;ome characters, or di&s;tingui&s;hing marks, by the help of which they could reduce them under &s;eparate cla&s;&s;es and heads. To this, perhaps, they owe their name of Figures. As the figure, or &s;hape of one body, di&s;tingui&s;hes it from another, &s;o the&s;e forms of Speech have, each of them, a ca&s;t or turn peculiar to it&s;elf, which both di&s;tingui&s;hes it from the re&s;t, and di&s;tingui&s;hes it from Simple Expre&s;&s;ion. Simple Expre&s;&s;ion ju&s;t makes our idea known to others; but Figurative Language, over and above, be|&s;tows a particular dre&s;s upon that idea; a dre&s;s, which both makes it be remarked, and adorns it. Hence, this &s;ort of Language be|came early a capital object of attention to tho&s;e who &s;tudied the powers of Speech.</P>
<P>FIGURES, in general, may be de&s;cribed to be that Language, which is prompted either by the imagination, or by the pa&s;&s;ions. The ju&s;tne&s;s of this de&s;cription will appear, from the more particular account I am afterwards to give of them. Rhetoricians commonly divide them into two great cla&s;&s;es; Figures of Words, and Figures of Thought. The former, Figures of Words, are commonly called Tropes, and con&s;i&s;t in a word's being employed to &s;ignify &s;omething that is differ|ent from its original and primitive meaning; &s;o that if you alter the word, you de&s;troy the Figure. Thus, in the in&s;tance I gave before; <Q REND="inline">"Light ari&s;eth to the upright, in darkne&s;s."</Q>
<PB N="327" REF="333">
The Trope con&s;i&s;ts, in <Q REND="inline">"light and darkne&s;s"</Q> being not meant literally, but &s;ub&s;tituted for comfort and adver&s;ity, on account of &s;ome re&s;emblance or analogy, which they are &s;up|po&s;ed to bear to the&s;e conditions of life. The other cla&s;s, termed Figures of Thought, &s;up|po&s;es the words to be u&s;ed in their proper and literal meaning, and the figure to con&s;i&s;t in the turn of the thought; as is the ca&s;e in exclamations, interrogations, apo&s;trophes, and compari&s;ons; where, though you vary the words that are u&s;ed, or tran&s;late them from one Language into another, you may, never|thele&s;s, &s;till pre&s;erve the &s;ame Figure in the thought. This di&s;tinction, however, is of no great u&s;e; as nothing can be built upon it in practice; neither is it always very clear. It is of little importance, whether we give to &s;ome particular mode of expre&s;&s;ion the name of a Trope, or of a Figure; provided we remember, that Figurative Language always imports &s;ome colouring of the imagination, or &s;ome emotion of pa&s;&s;ion, expre&s;&s;ed in our Style: And, perhaps, figures of imagination, and figures of pa&s;&s;ion, might be a more u&s;e|ful di&s;tribution of the &s;ubject. But without in&s;i&s;ting on any artificial divi&s;ions, it will be more u&s;eful, that I enquire into the Origin and the Nature of Figures. Only, before proceeding to this, there are two general ob&s;ervations which it may be proper to pre|mi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="334">
THE fir&s;t is, concerning the u&s;e of rules with re&s;pect to Figurative Language. I ad|mit, that per&s;ons may both &s;peak and write with propriety, who know not the names of any of the Figures of Speech, nor ever &s;tu|died any rules relating to them. Nature, as was before ob&s;erved, dictates the u&s;e of Fi|gures; and, like Mon&s;. Jourdain, in Moliere, who had &s;poken for forty years in pro&s;e, without ever knowing it, many a one u&s;es metaphorical expre&s;&s;ions to good purpo&s;e, without any idea of what a metaphor is. It will not, however, follow thence, that rules are of no &s;ervice. All &s;cience ari&s;es from ob&s;ervations on practice. Practice has al|ways gone before method and rule; but me|thod and rule have afterwards improved and perfected practice, in every art. We, every day, meet with per&s;ons who &s;ing agreeably, without knowing one note of the gamut. Yet, it has been found of importance to re|duce the&s;e notes to a &s;cale, and to form an art of mu&s;ic; and it would be ridiculous to pretend, that the art is of no advantage, be|cau&s;e the practice is founded in nature. Propriety and beauty of Speech, are certain|ly as improveable as the ear or the voice; and to know the principles of this beauty, or the rea&s;ons which render one Figure, or one manner of Speech preferable to another, can|not fail to a&s;&s;i&s;t and direct a proper choice.</P>
<P>BUT I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, in the next place, that, although this part of &s;tyle merit atten|tion,
<PB N="329" REF="335">
and be a very proper object of &s;cience and rule; although much of the beauty of compo&s;ition depends on figurative language; yet we mu&s;t beware of imagining that it de|pends &s;olely, or even chiefly, upon &s;uch lan|guage. It is not &s;o. The great place which the doctrine of tropes and figures has occu|pied in &s;y&s;tems of rhetoric; the over-anxi|ous care which has been &s;hewn in giving names to a va&s;t variety of them, and in ranging them under different cla&s;&s;es, has often led per&s;ons to imagine, that, if their compo|&s;ition was well be&s;pangled with a number of the&s;e ornaments of &s;peech, it wanted no other beauty; whence has ari&s;en much &s;tiff|ne&s;s and affectation. For it is, in truth, the &s;entiment or pa&s;&s;ion, which lies under the figured expre&s;&s;ion, that gives it any merit. The figure is only the dre&s;s; the &s;entiment is the body and the &s;ub&s;tance. No figures will render a cold or an empty compo&s;ition intere&s;ting; whereas, if a &s;entiment be &s;u|blime or pathetic, it can &s;upport it&s;elf per|fectly well, without any borrowed a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Hence &s;everal of the mo&s;t affecting and ad|mired pa&s;&s;ages of the be&s;t authors, are ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the &s;imple&s;t language. The fol|lowing &s;entiment from Virgil, for in&s;tance, makes its way at once to the heart, without the help of any figure whatever. He is de|&s;cribing an Argive, who falls in battle, in Italy, at a great di&s;tance from his native country:
<Q><PB N="330" REF="336">
<L>Sternitur, infelix, alieno vulnere, coelumque</L>

<L>"Alcides' friend, and brother of the war;</L>
<L>"Now falling, by another's wound, his eyes</L>
<L>"He ca&s;ts to Heaven, on Argos thinks, and dies."</L></Q>
In this tran&s;lation, much of the beauty of the original is lo&s;t. <Q REND="inline">"On Argos thinks and dies,"</Q> is by no means equal to <Q REND="inline">"dul|ces moriens remini&s;citur Argos:"</Q> As he dies, he remembers <Q REND="inline">"his beloved Argos."</Q>&mdash;It is indeed ob&s;ervable, that in mo&s;t of tho&s;e tender and pathetic pa&s;&s;ages, which do &s;o much ho|nour to Virgil, that great poet expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf with the ut|mo&s;t &s;implicity; as,
<Q><L>Te, dulcis Conjux, te &s;olo in littore &s;ecum.</L>
<L>Te veniente die, te decedente canebat.</L>
<BIBL>GEORG. IV.</BIBL></Q>
And &s;o in that moving prayer of Evander, upon his parting with his &s;on Pallas:
<Q><L>At vos, O Superi! et Div&ucirc;m tu maxime rector</L>
<L>Jupiter, Arcadii quae&s;o mi&s;ere&s;cite regis,</L>

A &s;ingle &s;troke of this kind, drawn as by the very pencil of Nature, is worth a thou&s;and figures. In the &s;ame manner, the &s;imple &s;tyle of Scripture: <Q REND="inline">"He &s;poke, and it was done; he commanded, and it &s;tood fa&s;t."&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline">"God &s;aid, let there be light; and there was light,"</Q> imports a lofty conception to
<PB N="331" REF="337">
much greater advantage, than if it had been decorated by the mo&s;t pompous metaphors. The fact is, that the &s;trong pathetic, and the pure &s;ublime, not only have little dependance on figures of &s;peech, but, generally, reject them. The proper region of the&s;e orna|ments is, where a moderate degree of eleva|tion and pa&s;&s;ion is predominant; and there they contribute to the embelli&s;hment of di&s;|cour&s;e, only, when there is a ba&s;is of &s;olid thought and natural &s;entiment; when they are in&s;erted in their proper place; and when they ri&s;e, of them&s;elves, from the &s;ubject, without being &s;ought after.</P>
<P>HAVING premi&s;ed the&s;e ob&s;ervations, I proceed to give an account of the origin and nature of Figures; principally of &s;uch as have their dependance on language; including that numerous tribe, which the rhetoricians call Tropes.</P>
<P>AT the fir&s;t ri&s;e of language, men would begin with giving names to the different ob|jects which they di&s;cerned, or thought of. This nomenclature would, at the beginning, be very narrow. According as men's ideas multiplied, and their acquaintance with ob|jects increa&s;ed, their &s;tock of names and words would increa&s;e al&s;o. But to the infinite variety of objects and ideas, no language is adequate. No language is &s;o copious, as to have a &s;eparate word for every &s;eparate idea. Men naturally &s;ought to abridge this labour of multiplying
<PB N="332" REF="338">
words <HI>in infinitum;</HI> and, in order to lay le&s;s bur|den on their memories, made one word, which they had already appropriated to a certain idea or object, &s;tand al&s;o for &s;ome other idea or object; between which and the primary one, they found, or fancied, &s;ome relation. Thus, the prepo&s;ition, <HI>in,</HI> was originally in|vented to expre&s;s the circum&s;tance of place: <Q REND="inline">"The man was killed <HI>in</HI> the wood."</Q> In pro|gre&s;s of time, words were wanted to expre&s;s men's being connected with certain conditi|ons of fortune, or certain &s;ituations of mind; and &s;ome re&s;emblance, or analogy, being fancied between the&s;e, and the place of bo|dies, the word, <HI>in,</HI> was employed to expre&s;s men's being &s;o circum&s;tanced; as, one's be|ing <HI>in</HI> health, or <HI>in</HI> &s;ickne&s;s, <HI>in</HI> pro&s;perity or <HI>in</HI> adver&s;ity, <HI>in</HI> joy or <HI>in</HI> grief, <HI>in</HI> doubt, or <HI>in</HI> danger, or <HI>in</HI> &s;afety. Here we &s;ee this prepo&s;ition, <HI>in,</HI> plainly a&s;&s;uming a tropical &s;ignification, or carried off from its original meaning, to &s;ignify &s;omething el&s;e, which relates to, or re&s;embles it.</P>
<P>TROPES of this kind abound in all lan|guages, and are plainly owing to the want of proper words. The operations of the mind and affections, in particular, are, in mo&s;t languages, de&s;cribed by words taken from &s;en&s;ible objects. The rea&s;on is plain. The names of &s;en&s;ible objects, were, in all lan|guages, the words mo&s;t early introduced; and were, by degrees, extended to tho&s;e mental objects, of which men had more ob|&s;cure
<PB N="333" REF="339">
conceptions, and to which they found it more difficult to a&s;&s;ign di&s;tinct names. They borrowed, therefore, the name of &s;ome &s;en&s;ible idea, where their imagination found &s;ome affinity. Thus, we &s;peak of, a <HI>piercing</HI> judgment, and a <HI>clear</HI> head; a <HI>&s;oft</HI> or a <HI>hard</HI> heart; a <HI>rough</HI> or a <HI>&s;mooth</HI> behaviour. We &s;ay, <HI>inflamed</HI> by anger, <HI>warmed</HI> by love, <HI>&s;well|ed</HI> with pride, <HI>melted</HI> into grief; and the&s;e are almo&s;t the only &s;ignificant words which we have for &s;uch ideas.</P>
<P>BUT, although the barrenne&s;s of language, and the want of words, be doubtle&s;s one cau&s;e of the invention of tropes; yet it is not the only, nor, perhaps, even the princi|pal &s;ource of this form of &s;peech. Tropes have ari&s;en more frequently, and &s;pread them|&s;elves wider, from the influence which Ima|gination po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es over all language. The train on which this has proceeded among all nations, I &s;hall endeavour to explain.</P>
<P>EVERY object which makes any impre&s;&s;ion on the human mind, is con&s;tantly accompani|ed with certain circum&s;tances and relations, that &s;trike us at the &s;ame time. It never pre&s;ents it&s;elf to our view, <HI>i&s;ol&eacute;,</HI> as the French expre&s;s it; that is, independent on, and &s;e|parated from, every other thing; but always occurs as &s;omehow related to other objects; going before them, or following after them; their effect or their cau&s;e; re&s;embling them, or oppo&s;ed to them; di&s;tingui&s;hed by certain
<PB N="334" REF="340">
qualities, or &s;urrounded with certain circum|&s;tances. By this means, every idea or ob|ject carries in its train &s;ome other ideas, which may be con&s;idered as its acce&s;&s;ories. The&s;e acce&s;&s;ories often &s;trike the imagination more than the principal idea it&s;elf. They are, perhaps, more agreeable ideas; or they are more familiar to our conceptions; or they recal to our memory a greater variety of im|portant circum&s;tances. The imagination is more di&s;po&s;ed to re&s;t upon &s;ome of them; and therefore, in&s;tead of u&s;ing the proper name of the principal idea which it means to expre&s;s, it employs, in its place, the name of the acce&s;&s;ory or corre&s;pondent idea; al|though the principal have a proper and well|known name of its own. Hence a va&s;t va|riety of tropical or figurative words obtain currency in all languages, through choice, not nece&s;&s;ity; and men of lively imagina|tions are every day adding to their number.</P>
<P>THUS, when we de&s;ign to intimate the pe|riod, at which a &s;tate enjoyed mo&s;t reputation o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> glory, it were ea&s;y to employ the proper words for expre&s;&s;ing this; but as this readily connects, in our imagination, with the flou|ri&s;hing period of a plant or a tree, we lay hold of this corre&s;pondent idea, and &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"The Roman empire flouri&s;hed mo&s;t under Au|gu&s;tus."</Q> The leader of a faction, is plain language; but, becau&s;e the head is the prin|cipal part of the human body, and is &s;up|po&s;ed to direct all the animal operations, re&s;t|ing
<PB N="335" REF="341">
upon this re&s;emblance, we &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Cati|line was the head of the party."</Q> The word, <HI>Voice,</HI> was originally invented to &s;ig|nify the articulate &s;ound, formed by the or|gans of the mouth; but, as by means of it men &s;ignify their ideas and their intentions to each other, <HI>Voice</HI> &s;oon a&s;&s;umed a great ma|ny other meanings, all derived from this pri|mary effect. <Q REND="inline">"To give our Voice"</Q> for any thing, &s;ignified, to give our &s;entiment in fa|vour of it. Not only &s;o; but <HI>Voice</HI> was trans|ferred to &s;ignify any intimation of will or judgment, though given without the lea&s;t in|terpo&s;ition of Voice in its literal &s;en&s;e, or any &s;ound uttered at all. Thus we &s;peak of li&s;|tening to the <HI>Voice</HI> of Con&s;cience, the <HI>Voice</HI> of Nature, the <HI>Voice</HI> of God. This u&s;age takes place, not &s;o much from barrenne&s;s of language, or want of a proper word, as from an allu&s;ion which we choo&s;e to make to <HI>Voice,</HI> in its primary &s;en&s;e, in order to convey our idea, connected with a circum&s;tance which appears to the fancy to give it more &s;pright|line&s;s and force.</P>
<P>THE account which I have now given, and which &s;eems to be a full and fair one, of the introduction of Tropes into all Languages, coincides with what Cicero &s;hortly hints, in his third book De Oratore. <Q REND="inline">"Modus trans|ferendi verba lat&egrave; patet; quam nece&s;&s;itas primum genuit, coacta inopia et angu&s;tias; po&s;t autem delectatio, jucundita&s;que cele|bravit.

For, as garments were fir&s;t contrived to defend our bodies from the cold, and afterwards were employed for the purpo&s;e of ornament and dignity, &s;o Figures of Speech, introduced by want, were cultivated for the &s;ake of entertainment."</Q></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>FROM what has been &s;aid, it clearly ap|pears, how that mu&s;t come to pa&s;s, which I had occa&s;ion to mention in a former Lecture, that all Languages are mo&s;t figurative in their early &s;tate. Both the cau&s;es to which I a&s;crib|ed the origin of Figures, concur in produc|ing this effect at the beginnings of &s;ociety. Language is then mo&s;t barren; the &s;tock of proper names, which have been invented for things, is &s;mall; and, at the &s;ame time, ima|gination exerts great influence over the con|ceptions of men, and their method of utter|ing them; &s;o that, both from nece&s;&s;ity and from choice, their Speech will, at that period, abound in Tropes. For the &s;avage tribes of men are always much given to wonder and a&s;toni&s;hment. Every new object &s;urpri&s;es, terrifies, and makes a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion on their mind; they are governed by imagina|tion and pa&s;&s;ion, more than by rea&s;on; and, of cour&s;e, their &s;peech mu&s;t be deeply tinc|tured by their genius. In fact, we find, that
<PB N="337" REF="343">
this is the character of the American and In|dian Languages; bold, picture&s;que, and me|taphorical; full of &s;trong allu&s;ions to &s;en&s;ible qualities, and to &s;uch objects as &s;truck them mo&s;t in their wild and &s;olitary life. An In|dian chief makes a harangue to his tribe, in a &s;tyle full of &s;tronger metaphors than a Eu|ropean would u&s;e in an epic poem.</P>
<P>AS Language makes gradual progre&s;s to|wards refinement, almo&s;t every object comes to have a proper name given to it, and Per|&s;picuity and Preci&s;ion are more &s;tudied. But &s;till, for the rea&s;ons before given, borrowed words, or as rhetoricians call them, Tropes, mu&s;t continue to occupy a con&s;iderable place. In every Language, too, there are a multi|tude of words, which, though they were Figurative in their fir&s;t application to certain objects, yet, by long u&s;e, lo&s;e that figurative power wholly, and come to be con&s;idered as &s;imple and literal expre&s;&s;ions. In this ca&s;e, are the terms which I remarked before, as transferred from &s;en&s;ible qualities to the ope|rations or qualities of the mind, a <HI>piercing</HI> judgment, a <HI>clear</HI> head, a <HI>hard</HI> heart, and the like. There are other words which re|main in a &s;ort of middle &s;tate; which have neither lo&s;t wholly their figurative applicati|on, nor yet retain &s;o much of it, as to im|print any remarkable character of figured Lauguage on our &s;tyle; &s;uch as the&s;e phra&s;es, <Q REND="inline">"apprehend one's meaning;"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"enter on a &s;ubject;"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"follow out an argument;
<PB N="338" REF="344">
&s;tir up &s;trife;"</Q> and a great many more, of which our Language is full. In the u&s;e of &s;uch phra&s;es, correct writers will always pre|&s;erve a regard to the figure or allu&s;ion on which they are founded, and will be careful not to apply them in any way that is incon|&s;i&s;tent with it. One may be <Q REND="inline">"&s;heltered un|der the patronage of a great man;"</Q> but it were wrong to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"&s;heltered under the ma&s;que of di&s;&s;imulation,"</Q> as a ma&s;que conceals, but does not &s;helter. An object, in de&s;cription, may be <Q REND="inline">"clothed,"</Q> if you will, <Q REND="inline">"with epithets;"</Q> but it is not &s;o pro|per to &s;peak of its being <Q REND="inline">"clothed with cir|cum&s;tances;"</Q> as the word <Q REND="inline">"circum&s;tances,"</Q> alludes to &s;tanding round, not to clothing. Such attentions as the&s;e are requi&s;ite in the common run of Style.</P>
<P>WHAT has been &s;aid on this &s;ubject, tends to throw light on the nature of Language in general; and will lead to the rea&s;ons, Why Tropes or Figures contribute to the beauty and grace of Style.</P>
<P>FIRST, They enrich Language, and ren|der it more copious. By their means, words and phra&s;es are multiplied for expre&s;&s;ing all &s;orts of ideas; for de&s;cribing even the minute&s;t differences; the nice&s;t &s;hades and colours of thought; which no Language could po&s;&s;ibly do by proper words alone, without a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Tropes.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="345">
SECONDLY, They be&s;tow dignity upon Style. The familiarity of common words, to which our ears are much accu&s;tomed, tends to degrade Style. When we want to adapt our Language to the tone of an elevated &s;ub|ject, we would be greatly at a lo&s;s, if we could not borrow a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Figures; which, properly employed, have a &s;imilar effect on Language, with what is produced by the rich and &s;plendid dre&s;s of a per&s;on of rank; to create re&s;pect, and to give an air of mag|nificence to him who wears it. A&s;&s;i&s;tance of this kind, is often needed in pro&s;e compo&s;iti|ons; but poetry could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t without it. Hence Figures form the con&s;tant Language of poetry. To &s;ay, that <Q REND="inline">"the &s;un ri&s;es,"</Q> is trite and common; but it becomes a magni|ficent image when expre&s;&s;ed, as Mr. Thom|&s;on has done:
<Q><L>But yonder comes the powerful king of day</L>
<L>Rejoicing in the ea&s;t.&mdash;</L></Q>
To &s;ay, that <Q REND="inline">"all men are &s;ubject alike to death,"</Q> pre&s;ents only a vulgar idea; but it ri&s;es and fills the imagination, when paint|ed thus by Horace:
<Q><L>Pallida mors aequo pul&s;at pede, pauperum tabernas Regumque turres.</L></Q>
Or,<Q><L>Omnes eodem cogimur; omnium,</L>
<L>Ver&s;atur urna, &s;erius, ocyus,</L>
<L><PB N="340" REF="346">
Sors exitura, &amp; nos in eternum</L>
<L>Exilium impo&s;itura cymbae<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>With equal pace, impartial fate,</L>
<L>Knocks at the palace, as the cottage gate.</L></Q>
Or,
<Q><L>We all mu&s;t tread the paths of fate;</L>
<L>And ever &s;hakes the mortal urn;</L>
<L>Who&s;e lot embarks us, &s;oon or late,</L>
<L>On Charon's boat; ah! never to return.</L><BIBL>FRANCIS</BIBL></Q></NOTE>.</L></Q></P>
<P>IN the third place, Figures give us the plea&s;ure of enjoying two objects pre&s;ented together to our view, without confu&s;ion; the principal idea, which is the &s;ubject of the di&s;cour&s;e, along with its acce&s;&s;ory, which gives it the figurative dre&s;s. We &s;ee one thing in another, as Ari&s;totle expre&s;&s;es it; which is always agreeable to the mind. For there is nothing with which the fancy is more delighted, than with compari&s;ons, and re|&s;emblances of objects; and all Tropes are founded upon &s;ome relation or analogy be|tween one thing and another. When, for in&s;tance, in place of <Q REND="inline">"youth,"</Q> I &s;ay, the <Q REND="inline">"morning of life;"</Q> the fancy is immediately entertained with all the re&s;embling circum|&s;tances which pre&s;ently occur between the&s;e two objects. At one moment, I have in my eye a certain period of human life, and a certain time of the day, &s;o related to each other, that the imagination plays between them with plea&s;ure, and contemplates two &s;imilar objects, in one view, without em|barra&s;&s;ment or confu&s;ion.

IN the fourth place, Figures are attended with this farther advantage, of giving us fre|quently a much clearer and more &s;triking view of the principal object, than we could have if it were expre&s;&s;ed in &s;imple terms, and dive&s;ted of its acce&s;&s;ory idea. This is, in|deed, their principal advantage, in virtue of which, they are very properly &s;aid to illu&s;|trate a &s;ubject, or to throw light upon it. For they exhibit the object, on which they are employed, in a picture&s;que form; they can render an ab&s;tract conception, in &s;ome degree, an object of &s;en&s;e; they &s;urround it with &s;uch circum&s;tances, as enable the mind to lay hold of it &s;teadily, and to contemplate it fully. <Q REND="inline">"Tho&s;e per&s;ons,"</Q> &s;ays one, <Q REND="inline">"who gain the hearts of mo&s;t people, who are cho&s;en as the companions of their &s;ofter hours, and their reliefs from anxiety and care, are &s;eldom per&s;ons of &s;hining quali|ties, or &s;trong virtues: it is rather the &s;oft green of the &s;oul, on which we re&s;t our eyes, that are fatigued with beholding more glaring objects."</Q> Here, by a happy allu&s;i|on to a colour, the whole conception is con|veyed clear and &s;trong to the mind in one word. By a well cho&s;en Figure, even convic|tion is a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and the impre&s;&s;ion of a truth upon the mind, made more lively and forci|ble than it would otherwi&s;e be. As in the following illu&s;tration of Dr. Young's: <Q REND="inline">"When we dip too deep in plea&s;ure, we always &s;tir a &s;ediment that renders it impure and noxi|ous;"</Q> or in this, <Q REND="inline">"A heart boiling with
<PB N="342" REF="348">
violent pa&s;&s;ions, will always &s;end up infa|tuating fumes to the head."</Q> An image that pre&s;ents &s;o much congruity between a moral and a &s;en&s;ible idea, &s;erves like an argument from analogy, to enforce what the author a&s;&s;erts, and to induce belief.</P>
<P>BESIDES, whether we are endeavouring to rai&s;e &s;entiments of plea&s;ure or aver&s;ion, we can always heighten the emotion by the figures which we introduce; leading the ima|gination to a train, either of agreeable or di&s;|agreeable, of exalting or deba&s;ing ideas, cor|re&s;pondent to the impre&s;&s;ion which we &s;eek to make. When we want to render an ob|ject beautiful, or magnificent, we borrow images from all the mo&s;t beautiful or &s;plen|did &s;cenes of nature; we thereby, naturally, throw a lu&s;tre over our object; we enliven the reader's mind; and di&s;po&s;e him to go along with us, in the gay and plea&s;ing im|pre&s;&s;ions which we give him of the &s;ubject. This effect of Figures is happily touched in the following lines of Dr. Aken&s;ide, and il|lu&s;trated by a very &s;ublime figure:<Q><L>&mdash;Then the inexpre&s;&s;ive &s;train,</L>
<L>Diffu&s;es its enchantment. Fancy dreams</L>
<L>Of &s;acred fountains and Ely&s;ian groves,</L>

WHAT I have now explained, concerning the u&s;e and effects of Figures, naturally leads us to reflect on the wonderful power of Lan|guage; and, indeed, we cannot reflect on it without the highe&s;t admiration. What a fine vehicle is it now become for all the con|ceptions of the human mind; even for the mo&s;t &s;ubtile and delicate workings of the imagination! What a pliant and flexible in|&s;trument in the hand of one who can em|ploy it &s;kilfully; prepared to take every form which he chu&s;es to give it! Not content with a &s;imple communication of ideas and thoughts, it paints tho&s;e ideas to the eye; it gives co|louring and relievo, even to the mo&s;t ab|&s;tract conceptions. In the figures which it u&s;es, it &s;ets mirrors before us, where we may behold objects, a &s;econd time, in their like|ne&s;s. It entertains us, as with a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t &s;plendid pictures; di&s;po&s;es, in the mo&s;t artificial manner, of the light and &s;hade, for viewing every thing to the be&s;t advantage; in fine, from being a rude and imperfect interpreter of men's wants and ne|ce&s;&s;ities, it has now pa&s;&s;ed into an in&s;trument of the mo&s;t delicate and refined luxury.</P>
<P>To make the&s;e effects of Figurative Lan|guage &s;en&s;ible, there are few authors in the Engli&s;h Language, whom I can refer to with more advantage than Mr. Addi&s;on, who&s;e imagination is, at once, remarkably rich, and remarkably correct and cha&s;te. When he is treating, for in&s;tance, of the effect which
<PB N="344" REF="350">
light and colours have to entertain the fancy, con&s;idered in Mr. Locke's view of them as &s;econdary qualities, which have no real exi&s;t|ence in matter, but are only ideas in the mind, with what beautiful painting has he adorned this philo&s;ophic &s;peculation? <Q REND="inline">"Things,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">"would make but a poor appearance to the eye, if we &s;aw them only in their proper figures and mo|tions. Now, we are every where enter|tained with plea&s;ing &s;hows and apparitions; we di&s;cover imaginary glories in the hea|vens, and in the earth, and &s;ee &s;ome of this vi&s;ionary beauty poured out upon the whole creation. But what a rough un|&s;ightly &s;ketch of nature &s;hould we be en|tertained with, did all her colouring di&s;ap|pear, and the &s;everal di&s;tinctions of light and &s;hade vani&s;h? In &s;hort, our &s;ouls are, at pre&s;ent, delightfully lo&s;t, and bewilder|ed in a plea&s;ing delu&s;ion; and we walk about, like the enchanted hero of a ro|mance, who &s;ees beautiful ca&s;tles, woods, and meadows; and, at the &s;ame time, hears the warbling of birds, and the purling of &s;treams; but, upon the fini&s;hing of &s;ome &s;ecret &s;pell, the fanta&s;tic &s;cene breaks up, and the di&s;con&s;olate knight finds him&s;elf on a barren heath, or in a &s;olitary de&s;ert. It is not improbable, that &s;omething like this may be the &s;tate of the &s;oul after its fir&s;t &s;eparation, in re&s;pect of the images it will receive from matter." <BIBL>No. 413.

HAVING thus explained, at &s;ufficient length, the Origin, the Nature, and the Effects of Tropes, I &s;hould proceed next to the &s;everal kinds and divi&s;ions of them. But, in treat|ing of the&s;e, were I to follow the common tract of the &s;chola&s;tic writers on Rhetoric, I &s;hould &s;oon become tedious, and, I appre|hend, u&s;ele&s;s, at the &s;ame time. Their great bu&s;ine&s;s has been, with a mo&s;t patient and frivolous indu&s;try, to branch them out under a va&s;t number of divi&s;ions, according to all the &s;everal modes in which a word may be carried from its literal meaning, into one that is Figurative, without doing any more; as if the mere knowledge of the names and cla&s;&s;es of all the Tropes that can be formed, could be of any advantage towards the proper, or graceful u&s;e of Language. All that I pur|po&s;e is, to give, in a few words, before fini&s;h|ing this Lecture, a general view of the &s;eve|ral &s;ources whence the tropical meaning of words is derived: after which I &s;hall, in &s;ub|&s;equent Lectures, de&s;cend to a more particu|lar con&s;ideration of &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;i|derable Figures of Speech, and &s;uch as are in mo&s;t frequent u&s;e; by treating of which, I &s;hall give all the in&s;truction I can, concern|ing the proper employment of Figurative Language, and point out the errors and abu&s;es which are apt to be committed in this part of &s;tyle.</P>
<P>ALL Tropes, as I before ob&s;erved, are founded on the relation which one object
<PB N="346" REF="352">
bears to another; in virtue of which, the name of the one can be &s;ub&s;tituted in&s;tead of the name of the other; and by &s;uch a &s;ub&s;titution, the vivacity of the idea is com|monly meant to be increa&s;ed. The&s;e relati|ons, &s;ome more, &s;ome le&s;s intimate, may all give ri&s;e to Tropes. One of the fir&s;t and mo&s;t obvious relations is, that between a cau&s;e and its effect. Hence, in Figurative Language, the cau&s;e is, &s;ometimes, put for the effect. Thus, Mr. Addi&s;on, writing of Italy:
<Q><L>Blo&s;&s;oms, and fruits, and flowers, together ri&s;e,</L>
<L>And the whole year in gay confu&s;ion lies.</L></Q>
Where the <Q REND="inline">"whole year"</Q> is plainly intended, to &s;ignify the effects or productions of all the &s;ea&s;ons of the year. At other times, again, the effect is put for the cau&s;e; as, <Q REND="inline">"grey hairs"</Q> frequently for old age, which cau&s;es grey hairs; and <Q REND="inline">"&s;hade,"</Q> for trees that produce the &s;hade. The relation between the container and the thing contained, is al&s;o &s;o intimate and obvious, as naturally to give ri&s;e to Tropes:
<Q><L>&mdash;Ille impiger hau&s;it</L>
<L>Spumantem pateram &amp; pleno &s;e proluit auro.</L></Q>
Where every one &s;ees, that the cup and the gold are put for the liquor that was contained in the golden cup. In the &s;ame manner, the name of any country, is often u&s;ed to de|note
<PB N="347" REF="353">
the inhabitants of that country; and Heaven, very commonly employed to &s;igni|fy God, becau&s;e he is conceived as dwelling in Heaven. To implore the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Heaven, is the &s;ame as to implore the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of God. The relation betwixt any e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ign and the thing &s;ignified, is a further &s;ource of Tropes. Hence,
<Q><L>Cedant arma togae; concedat laurea linguae.</L></Q>
The <Q REND="inline">"toga,"</Q> being the badge of the civil profe&s;&s;ions, and the <Q REND="inline">"laurel,"</Q> of military ho|nours, the badge of each is put for the civil and military characters them&s;elves. To <Q REND="inline">"a&s;|&s;ume the &s;ceptre,"</Q> is a common phra&s;e for entering on royal authority. To Tropes, founded on the&s;e &s;everal relations, of cau&s;e and effect, container and contained, &s;ign and thing &s;ignified, is given the name of Metonymy.</P>
<P>WHEN the Trope is founded on the rela|tion between an antecedent and a con&s;equent, or what goes before, and immediately follows after, it is then called a Metalep&s;is; as in the Roman phra&s;e of <Q REND="inline">"Fuit,"</Q> or <Q REND="inline">"Vixit,"</Q> to expre&s;s that one was dead. <Q REND="inline">"Fuit Ilium et ingens gloria Dardanidum,"</Q> &s;ignifies, that the glory of Troy is now no more.</P>
<P>WHEN the whole is put for a part, or a part for the whole; a genus for a &s;pecies, or a &s;pecies for a genus; the &s;ingular for the
<PB N="348" REF="354">
plural, or the plural for the &s;ingular num|ber; in general, when any thing le&s;s, or any thing more, is put for the preci&s;e object meant; the figure is then called a Synec|doche. It is very common, for in&s;tance, to de&s;cribe a whole object by &s;ome remarkable part of it; as when we &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"A fleet of &s;o many &s;ail,"</Q> in the place of <Q REND="inline">"&s;hips;"</Q> when we u&s;e the <Q REND="inline">"head"</Q> for the <Q REND="inline">"per&s;on,"</Q> the <Q REND="inline">"pole"</Q> for the <Q REND="inline">"earth,"</Q> the <Q REND="inline">"waves"</Q> for the <Q REND="inline">"&s;ea."</Q> In like manner, an attribute may be put for a &s;ubject; as, <Q REND="inline">"Youth and Beauty,"</Q> for <Q REND="inline">"the young and beautiful;"</Q> and &s;ome|times a &s;ubject for the attribute. But it is needle&s;s to in&s;i&s;t longer on this enumeration, which &s;erves little purpo&s;e. I have &s;aid enough, to give an opening into that great variety of relations between objects, by means of which, the mind is a&s;&s;i&s;ted to pa&s;s ea&s;ily from one to another; and, by the name of the one, under&s;tands the other to be meant. It is always &s;ome acce&s;&s;ory idea, which recals the principal to the imagina|tion; and commonly recals it with more force, than if the principal idea had been expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE relation which, of all others, is by far the mo&s;t fruitful of Tropes, I have not yet mentioned; that is, the relation of Similitude and Re&s;emblance. On this is founded what is called the Metaphor: when, in place of u&s;ing the proper name of any object, we em|ploy, in its place, the name of &s;ome other
<PB N="349" REF="355">
which is like it; which is a &s;ort of picture of it, and which thereby awakens the concep|tion of it with more force or grace. This figure is more frequent than all the re&s;t put toge|ther; and the language, both of pro&s;e and ver&s;e, owes to it much of its elegance and grace. This, therefore, de&s;erves very full and particular con&s;ideration; and &s;hall be the &s;ubject of the next Lecture.</P>

<HEAD>LECTURE XV. METAPHOR.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the preliminary ob&s;ervations I have made, relating to Figurative Lan|guage in general, I come now to treat &s;epa|rately of &s;uch Figures of Speech, as occur mo&s;t frequently, and require particular at|tention: and I begin with Metaphor. This is a figure founded entirely on the re&s;emblance which one object bears to another. Hence, it is much allied to Simile, or Compari&s;on; and is indeed no other than a compari&s;on, expre&s;&s;ed in an abridged form. When I &s;ay of &s;ome great mini&s;ter, <Q REND="inline">"that he upholds the &s;tate, like a pillar which &s;upports the weight of a whole edifice,"</Q> I fairly make a com|pari&s;on; but when I &s;ay of &s;uch a mini&s;ter, <Q REND="inline">"that he is the Pillar of the &s;tate,"</Q> it is now beeome a Metaphor. The compari&s;on be|twixt the Mini&s;ter and a Pillar, is made in the mind; but is expre&s;&s;ed without any of the words that denote compari&s;on. The
<PB N="351" REF="357">
compari&s;on is only in&s;inuated, not expre&s;&s;ed: the one object is &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;o like the other, that, without formally drawing the compari&s;on, the name of the one may be put in the place of the name of the other. <Q REND="inline">"The mini&s;ter is the Pillar of the &s;tate."</Q> This, therefore, is a more lively and ani|mated manner of expre&s;&s;ing the re&s;emblances which imagination traces among objects. There is nothing which delights the fancy more, than this act of comparing things to|gether, di&s;covering re&s;emblances between them, and de&s;cribing them by their likene&s;s. The mind thus employed, is exerci&s;ed with|out being fatigued; and is gratified with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of its own ingenuity. We need not be &s;urpri&s;ed, therefore, at finding all Language tinctured &s;trongly with Meta|phor. It in&s;inuates it&s;elf even into familiar conver&s;ation; and, un&s;ought, ri&s;es up of its own accord in the mind. The very words which I have ca&s;ually employed in de&s;cribing this, are a proof of what I &s;ay; <HI>tinctured, in&s;inuates, ri&s;es up,</HI> are all of them metapho|rical expre&s;&s;ions, borrowed from &s;ome re|&s;emblance which fancy forms between &s;en|&s;ible objects, and the internal operations of the mind; and yet the terms are no le&s;s clear, and, perhaps, more expre&s;&s;ive, than if words had been u&s;ed, which were to be taken in the &s;trict and literal &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>THOUGH all Metaphor imports compari|&s;on, and, therefore, is, in that re&s;pect, a
<PB N="352" REF="358">
figure of thought; yet, as the words in a Metaphor are not taken literally, but chang|ed from their proper to a Figurative &s;en&s;e, the Metaphor is commonly ranked among Tropes or Figures of words. But, provided the nature of it be well under&s;tood, it &s;igni|fies very little whether we call it a Figure or a Trope. I have confined it to the expre&s;&s;ion of re&s;emblance between two objects. I mu&s;t remark, however, that the word Metaphor is &s;ometimes u&s;ed in a loo&s;er and more extend|ed &s;en&s;e; for the application of a term in any figurative &s;ignification, whether the figure be founded on re&s;emblance, or on &s;ome other relation, which two objects bear to one ano|ther. For in&s;tance; when grey hairs are put for old age, as, <Q REND="inline">"to bring one's grey hairs with &s;orrow to the grave;"</Q> &s;ome writers would call this a Metaphor, though it is not properly one, but what rhetoricians call a Metonymy; that is, the effect put for the cau&s;e; <Q REND="inline">"grey hairs"</Q> being the effect of old age, but not bearing any &s;ort of re&s;emblance to it. Ari&s;totle, in his Poetics, u&s;es Meta|phor in this extended &s;en&s;e, for any figura|tive meaning impo&s;ed upon a word; as a whole put for the part, or a part for the whole; a &s;pecies for the genus, or a genus for the &s;pecies. But it would be unju&s;t to tax this mo&s;t acute writer with any inaccu|racy on this account; the minute &s;ubdivi&s;i|ons, and various names of Tropes, being un|known in his days, and the invention of later rhetoricians. Now, however, when the&s;e
<PB N="353" REF="359">
divi&s;ions are e&s;tabli&s;hed, it is inaccurate to call every figurative u&s;e of terms, promi&s;|cuou&s;ly, a Metaphor.</P>
<P>OF all the figures of Speech, none comes &s;o near to painting as Metaphor. Its pecu|liar effect is to give light and &s;trength to de|&s;cription; to make intellectual ideas, in &s;ome &s;ort, vi&s;ible to the eye, by giving them co|lour, and &s;ub&s;tance, and &s;en&s;ible qualities. In order to produce this effect, however, a delicate hand is required; for, by a very lit|tle inaccuracy, we are in hazard of intro|ducing confu&s;ion, in place of promoting Per|&s;picuity. Several rules, therefore, are nece&s;|&s;ary to be given for the proper management of Metaphors. But, before entering on the&s;e, I &s;hall give one in&s;tance of a very beautiful Metaphor, that I may &s;how the figure to full advantage. I &s;hall take my in&s;tance from Lord Bolingbroke's Remarks on the Hi&s;tory of England. Ju&s;t at the conclu&s;ion of his work, he is &s;peaking of the behaviour of Charles I. to his la&s;t parliament: <Q REND="inline">"In a word,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">"about a month after their meeting, he di&s;&s;olved them; he repented; but he re|pented too late of his ra&s;hne&s;s. Well might he repent; for the ve&s;&s;el was now full, and this la&s;t drop made the waters of bitterne&s;s overflow."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Here,"</Q> he adds, <Q REND="inline">"we draw the curtain, and put an end to our remarks."</Q> Nothing could be more happily thrown off. The Metaphor, we &s;ee,
<PB N="354" REF="360">
is continued through &s;everal expre&s;&s;ions. The <HI>ve&s;&s;el</HI> is put for the &s;tate, or temper of the nation already <HI>full,</HI> that is, provoked to the highe&s;t by former oppre&s;&s;ions and wrongs; this <HI>la&s;t drop,</HI> &s;tands for the provocation re|cently received by the abrupt di&s;&s;olution of the parliament; and the <HI>overflowing of the waters of bitterne&s;s,</HI> beautifully expre&s;&s;es all the effects of re&s;entment let loo&s;e by an ex|a&s;perated people.</P>
<P>ON this pa&s;&s;age, we may make two remarks in pa&s;&s;ing. The one, that nothing forms a more &s;pirited and dignified conclu&s;ion of a &s;ubject, than a figure of this kind happily placed at the clo&s;e. We &s;ee the effect of it, in this in&s;tance. The author goes off with a good grace; and leaves a &s;trong and full impre&s;&s;ion of his &s;ubject on the reader's mind. My other remark is, the advantage which a Metaphor frequently has above a formal compari&s;on. How much would the &s;entiment here have been enfeebled, if it had been expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;tyle of a regular &s;i|mile, thus: <Q REND="inline">"Well might he repent; for the &s;tate of the nation, loaded with griev|ances and provocations, re&s;embled a ve&s;|&s;el that was now full, and this &s;uperadded provocation, like the la&s;t drop infu&s;ed, made their rage and re&s;entment, as wa|ters of bitterne&s;s, overflow."</Q> It has infi|nitely more &s;pirit and force as it now &s;tands, in the form of a Metaphor. <Q REND="inline">"Well might he repent; for the ve&s;&s;el was now full; and
<PB N="355" REF="361">
this la&s;t drop made the waters of bitter|ne&s;s overflow."</Q></P>
<P>HAVING mentioned, with applau&s;e, this in&s;tance from Lord Bolingbroke, I think it incumbent on me here to take notice, that, though I may have recour&s;e to this author, &s;ometimes, for examples of &s;tyle, it is his &s;tyle only, and not his &s;entiments, that de|&s;erve prai&s;e. It is, indeed, my opinion, that there are few writings in the Engli&s;h Lan|guage, which, for the matter contained in them, can be read with le&s;s profit or fruit, than Lord Bolingbroke's works. His politi|cal writings have the merit of a very lively and eloquent &s;tyle; but they have no other; being, as to the &s;ub&s;tance, the mere tempo|rary productions of faction and party; no better, indeed, than pamphlets written for the day. His Po&s;thumous, or, as they are called, his Philo&s;ophical Works, wherein he attacks religion, have &s;till le&s;s merit; for they are as loo&s;e in the &s;tyle as they are flim&s;y in the rea&s;oning. An unhappy in&s;tance, this author is, of parts and genius &s;o mi&s;erably perverted by faction and pa&s;&s;ion, that, as his memory will de&s;cend to po&s;terity with little honour, &s;o his productions will &s;oon pa&s;s, and are, indeed, already pa&s;&s;ing into neglect and oblivion.</P>
<P>RETURNING from this digre&s;&s;ion to the &s;ubject before us, I proceed to lay down the rules to be ob&s;erved in the conduct of Meta|phors;
<PB N="356" REF="362">
and which are much the &s;ame for Tropes of every kind.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t which I &s;hall mention, is, that they be &s;uited to the nature of the &s;ubject of which we treat; neither too many, nor too gay, nor too elevated for it; that we neither attempt to force the &s;ubject, by means of them, into a degree of elevation which is not congruous to it; nor, on the other hand, al|low it to &s;ink below its proper dignity. This is a direction which belongs to all Figurative Language, and &s;hould be ever kept in view. Some Metaphors are allowable, nay beauti|ful, in poetry, which it would be ab&s;urd and unnatural to employ in pro&s;e; &s;ome may be graceful in orations, which would be very improper in hi&s;torical, or philo&s;ophical com|po&s;ition. We mu&s;t remember, that figures are the dre&s;s of our &s;entiments. As there is a natural congruity between dre&s;s, and the character or rank of the per&s;on who wears it, a violation of which congruity never fails to hurt; the &s;ame holds preci&s;ely as to the ap|plication of figures to &s;entiment. The ex|ce&s;&s;ive, or un&s;ea&s;onable employment of them, is mere foppery in writing. It gives a boyi&s;h air to compo&s;ition; and, in&s;tead of rai&s;ing a &s;ubject, in fact, dimini&s;hes its dignity. For, as in life, true dignity mu&s;t be founded on character, not on dre&s;s and appearance, &s;o the dignity of compo&s;ition mu&s;t ari&s;e from &s;entiment and thought, not from ornament. The affectation and parade of ornament, de|tract
<PB N="357" REF="363">
as much from an author, as they do from a man. Figures and Metaphors, there|fore, &s;hould, on no occa&s;ion, be &s;tuck on too profu&s;ely; and never &s;hould, be &s;uch as re|fu&s;e to accord with the &s;train of our &s;enti|ment. Nothing can be more unnatural, than for a writer to carry on a train of rea&s;oning, in the &s;ame &s;ort of Figurative Language, which he would u&s;e in de&s;cription. When he rea&s;ons, we look only for per&s;picuity; when he de&s;cribes, we expect embelli&s;hment; when he divides, or relates, we de&s;ire plain|ne&s;s and &s;implicity. One of the greate&s;t &s;e|crets in compo&s;ition is, to know when to be &s;imple. This always gives a heightening to ornament, in its proper place. The right di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;hade, makes the light and colouring &s;trike the more: <Q REND="inline">"Is enim e&s;t elo|quens,"</Q> &s;ays Cicero, <Q REND="inline">"qui et humilia &s;ub|tiliter, et magna graviter, et mediocria temperat&egrave; pote&s;t dicere.&mdash;Nam qui nihil pote&s;t tranquill&egrave;, nihil leniter, nihil defi|nit&egrave;, di&s;tinct&egrave;, pote&s;t dicere, is, cum non praeparatis auribus inflammare rem caepit, furere apud &s;anos, et qua&s;i inter &s;obrios bacchari temulentus videtur<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"He is truly eloquent, who can di&s;cour&s;e of humble &s;ubjects in a plain &s;tyle, who can treat important ones with dignity, and &s;peak of things, which are of a middle nature, in a temperate &s;train.

<P>THE &s;econd rule, which I give, re&s;pects the choice of objects, from whence Meta|phors, and other Figures, are to be drawn. The field for Figurative Language is very wide. All nature, to &s;peak in the &s;tyle of fi|gures, opens its &s;tores to us, and admits us to gather, from all &s;en&s;ible objects, whatever can illu&s;trate intellectual or moral ideas. Not only the gay and &s;plendid objects of &s;en&s;e, but the grave, the terrifying, and even the gloomy and di&s;mal, can, on different occa&s;i|ons, be introduced into figures with proprie|ty. But we mu&s;t beware of ever u&s;ing &s;uch allu&s;ions as rai&s;e in the mind di&s;agreeable, mean, vulgar, or dirty ideas. Even, when Metaphors are cho&s;en in order to vilify and degrade any object, an author &s;hould &s;tudy
<PB N="359" REF="365">
never to be nau&s;eous in his allu&s;ions, Cicero blames an orator of his time, for terming his enemy <Q REND="inline">"Stercus Curiae;"</Q>  <Q REND="inline">"quamvis &s;it &s;i|mile,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">"tamen e&s;t deformis cogi|tatio &s;imilitudinis."</Q> But, in &s;ubjects of dignity, it is an unpardonable fault to intro|duce mean and vulgar Metaphors. In the treati&s;e on the Art of Sinking, in Dean Swift's works, there is a full and humourous collec|tion of in&s;tances of this kind, wherein au|thors, in&s;tead of exalting, have contrived to degrade, their &s;ubjects by the figures they employed. Authors of greater note than tho&s;e which are there quoted, have, at times, fallen into this error. Archbi&s;hop Tillot&s;on, for in&s;tance, is &s;ometimes negligent in his choice of Metaphors; as, when &s;peaking of the day of judgment, he de&s;cribes the world, as <Q REND="inline">"cracking about the &s;inners ears."</Q> Shake|&s;peare, who&s;e imagination was rich and bold, in a much greater degree than it was deli|cate, often fails here. The following, for ex|ample, is a gro&s;s tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; in his Henry V. having mentioned a dunghill, he pre&s;ent|ly rai&s;es a Metaphor from the &s;team of it; and on a &s;ubject too, that naturally led to much nobler ideas:<Q><L>And tho&s;e that leave their valiant bones in France,</L>
<L>Dying like men, though buried in your dunghills</L>
<L>They &s;hall be fam'd; for there the &s;un &s;hall greet them,</L>

IN the third place, as Metaphors &s;hould be drawn from objects of &s;ome dignity, &s;o particular care &s;hould be taken that the re|&s;emblance, which is the foundation of the Metaphor, be clear and per&s;picuous, not far-fetched, nor difficult to di&s;cover. The tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of this rule makes, what are called har&s;h or forced Metaphors, which are always di&s;plea&s;ing, becau&s;e they puzzle the reader, and, in&s;tead of illu&s;trating the thought, render it perplexed and intricate. With Me|taphors of this kind, Cowley abounds. He, and &s;ome of the writers of his age, &s;eem to have con&s;idered it as the perfection of wit, to hit upon likene&s;&s;es between objects which no other per&s;on could have di&s;covered; and, at the &s;ame time, to pur&s;ue tho&s;e Metaphors &s;o far, that it requires &s;ome ingenuity to fol|low them out, and comprehend them. This makes a Metaphor re&s;emble an aenigma; and is the very rever&s;e of Cicero's rule on this head: <Q REND="inline">"Verecunda debet e&s;&s;e tran&s;latio; ut deducta e&s;&s;e in alienum locum non irrui&s;&s;e, atque ut voluntario non vi veni&s;&s;e videa|tur<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Every Metaphor &s;hould be mode&s;t, &s;o that it may car|ry the appearance of having been led, not of having forced it&s;elf into the place of that word who&s;e room it occupies; that it may &s;eem to have come thither of its own accord, and not by con&s;traint." <BIBL>De Oratore, L. III. c. 53.</BIBL></Q> </NOTE>."</Q> How forced and ob&s;cure, for in|&s;tance, are the following ver&s;es of Cowley, &s;peaking of his mi&s;tre&s;s:<Q><L>Wo to her &s;tubborn heart, if once mine come</L>

To be new, and not vulgar, is a beauty. But when they are fetched from &s;ome likene&s;s too re|mote, and lying too far out of the road of ordinary thought, then, be&s;ides their ob&s;cu|rity, they have al&s;o the di&s;advantage of ap|pearing

laboured, and, as the French call it, <Q REND="inline">"recherch&eacute;:"</Q> whereas Metaphor, like every other ornament, lo&s;es its whole grace, when it does not &s;eem natural and ea&s;y.</P>
<P>IT is but a bad and ungraceful &s;oftening, which writers &s;ometimes u&s;e for a har&s;h me|taphor, when they palliate it with the ex|pre&s;&s;ion, <HI>as it were.</HI> This is but an awkward parenthe&s;is; and Metaphors, which need this apology of an <HI>as it were,</HI> had, generally, be better omitted. Metaphors, too, borrow|ed from any of the &s;ciences, e&s;pecially &s;uch of them as belong to particular profe&s;&s;ions, are almo&s;t always faulty by their ob&s;cu|rity.</P>
<P>IN the fourth place, it mu&s;t be carefully attended to, in the conduct of Metaphors, never to jumble metaphorical and plain lan|guage together; never to con&s;truct a period &s;o, that part of it mu&s;t be under&s;tood meta|phorically, part literally: which always pro|duces a mo&s;t di&s;agreeable confu&s;ion. In|&s;tances, which are but too frequent, even in good authors, will make this rule, and the rea&s;on of it, be clearly under&s;tood. In Mr. Pope's tran&s;lation of the Ody&s;&s;ey, Penelope, bewailing the abrupt departure of her &s;on Telemachus, is made to &s;peak thus:<Q><L>Long to my joys my deare&s;t Lord is lo&s;t,</L>

This is incon&s;i&s;tent. The Poet &s;hould either have kept him&s;elf to to the idea of a Man, in the literal &s;en&s;e; or, if he figured him by a Column, he &s;hould have a&s;cribed nothing to him but what be|longed to it. He was not at liberty to a&s;cribe to that Column the actions and properties of a Man. Such unnatural mixtures render the image indi&s;tinct; leaving it to waver, in our conception, between the figurative and the literal &s;en&s;e. Horace's rule, which he applies to Characters, &s;hould be ob&s;erved by all wri|ters who deal in Figures:
<Q><L>&mdash;Servetur ad imum,</L>
<L>Qualis ab incepto proce&s;&s;erit, et &s;ibi con&s;tet.</L></Q>
Mr. Pope, el&s;ewhere, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the King, &s;ays,

<L>To thee the World its pre&s;ent homage pays,</L>
<L>The harve&s;t early, but mature the prai&s;e.</L></Q>
This, though not &s;o gro&s;s, is a fault, how|ever, of the &s;ame kind. It is plain, that, had not the rhyme mi&s;led him to the choice of an improper phra&s;e, he would have &s;aid,
<Q><L>The Harve&s;t early, but mature the crop:</L></Q>
And &s;o would have continued the figure which he had begun. Whereas, by drop|ping it unfini&s;hed, and by employing the li|teral word, <HI>prai&s;e,</HI> when we were expecting &s;omething that related to the Harve&s;t, the figure is broken, and the two members of the &s;entence have no proper corre&s;pondent with each other:
<Q><L>The <HI>Harve&s;t</HI> early, but mature the <HI>Prai&s;e.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>THE Works of O&s;&s;ian abound with beau|tiful and correct Metaphors; &s;uch as that on a Hero: <Q REND="inline">"In peace, thou art the Gate of Spring; in war, the Mountain Storm."</Q> Or this, on a Woman: <Q REND="inline">"She was covered with the Light of Beauty; but her heart was the Hou&s;e of Pride."</Q> They afford, however, one in&s;tance of the fault we are now cen&s;uring: <Q REND="inline">"Trothal went forth with the Stream of his people, but they met a Rock: for Fingal &s;tood unmoved; broken they rolled back from his &s;ide. Nor did they roll in &s;afety; the &s;pear of the King
<PB N="365" REF="371">
pur&s;ued their flight."</Q> At the beginning, the Metaphor is very beautiful. The Stream, the unmoved Rock, the Waves rolling back broken, are expre&s;&s;ions employed in the pro|per and con&s;i&s;tent language of Figure; but, in the end, when we are told, <Q REND="inline">"they did not roll in &s;afety, becau&s;e the &s;pear of the King pur&s;ued their flight,"</Q> the literal mean|ing is improperly mixed with the Meta|phor: they are, at one and the &s;ame time, pre&s;ented to us as <HI>waves</HI> that <HI>roll,</HI> and men that may be <HI>pur&s;ued</HI> and <HI>wounded with a &s;pear.</HI> If it be faulty to jumble together, in this manner, metaphorical and plain language, it is &s;till more &s;o,</P>
<P>IN the fifth place, to make two different Metaphors meet on one object. This is what is called mixed Metaphor, and is indeed one of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t abu&s;es of this figure; &s;uch as Shake&s;peare's expre&s;&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">"to take arms again&s;t a &s;ea of troubles."</Q> This makes a mo&s;t unnatural medley, and confounds the imagination entirely.

By this means, we &s;hould become &s;en&s;ible, whether incon&s;i&s;tent circum|&s;tances were mixed, and a mon&s;trous image thereby produced, as in all tho&s;e faulty in|&s;tances, I have now been giving; or whether the object was, all along, pre&s;ented in one natural and con&s;i&s;tent point of view.</P>

As Metaphors ought never to be mixed, &s;o, in the &s;ixth place, we &s;hould avoid crowd|ing them together on the &s;ame object.

<P>THE only other rule concerning Metaphors which I &s;hall add, in the &s;eventh place, is, that they be not too far pur&s;ued. If the re|&s;emblance, on which the figure is founded, be long dwelt upon, and carried into all its minute circum&s;tances, we make an allegory in&s;tead of a metaphor; we tire the reader, who &s;oon wearies of this play of fancy; and we render our di&s;cour&s;e ob&s;cure. This is call|ed, &s;training a Metaphor. Cowley deals in this to exce&s;s; and to this error is owing, in a great mea&s;ure, that intricacy and har&s;hne&s;s, in his figurative Language, which I before remarked. Lord Shaft&s;bury, is &s;ometimes guilty of pur&s;uing his Metaphors too far. Fond, to a high degree, of every decoration of &s;tyle, when once he had hit upon a figure that plea&s;ed him, he was extremely loth to part with it. Thus, in his advice to an au|thor, having taken up &s;oliloquy, or medita|tion, under the Metaphor of a proper me|thod of evacuation for an author, he pur&s;ues this Metaphor through &s;everal pages, under all the forms <Q REND="inline">"of di&s;charging crudities, throw|ing off froth and &s;cum, bodily operation, taking phy&s;ic, curing indige&s;tion, giving
<PB N="371" REF="377">
vent to choler, bile, flatulencies, and tu|mours;"</Q> till at la&s;t, the idea becomes nau|&s;eous. Dr. Young al&s;o often tre&s;pa&s;&s;es in the &s;ame way. The merit, however, of this writer, in figurative Language, is great, and de&s;erves to be remarked. No writer, anti|ent or modern, had a &s;tronger imagination than Dr. Young, or one more fertile in figures of every kind. His Metaphors are often new, and often natural and beautiful. But, as his imagination was &s;trong and rich, rather than delicate and correct, he &s;ometimes gives it too loo&s;e reins. Hence, in his Night Thoughts, there prevails an ob&s;curity, and a hardne&s;s in his &s;tyle. The Metaphors are frequently too bold, and frequently too far pur&s;ued; the reader is dazzled rather than enlightened; and kept con&s;tantly on the &s;tretch to com|prehend, and keep pace with, the author. We may ob&s;erve, for in&s;tance, how the fol|lowing Metaphor is &s;pun out:<Q><L>Thy thoughts are vagabonds; all outward bound,</L>
<L>Mid&s;t &s;ands and rocks, and &s;torms, to crui&s;e for plea&s;ure,</L>
<L>If gained, dear bought; and better mi&s;s'd than gain'd.</L>
<L>Fancy and &s;en&s;e, from an infected &s;hore,</L>
<L>Thy cargo brings; and pe&s;tilence the prize;</L>
<L>Then &s;uch the thir&s;t, in&s;atiable thir&s;t,</L>
<L>By fond indulgence but inflam'd the more,</L>
<L>Fancy &s;till cruizes, when poor &s;en&s;e is tired.</L></Q></P>

Speaking of old age, he &s;ays, it &s;hould<Q><L>Walk thoughtful on the &s;ilent &s;olemn &s;hore</L>

<P>THE two fir&s;t lines are uncommonly beau|tiful; <Q REND="inline">"walk thoughtful on the &s;ilent, &amp;c."</Q> but when he continues the Metaphor, <Q REND="inline">"to putting good works on board, and waiting the wind,"</Q> it plainly becomes &s;trained, and &s;inks in dignity. Of all the Engli&s;h authors, I know none &s;o happy in his Metaphors as Mr. Addi&s;on. His imagination was neither &s;o rich nor &s;o &s;trong as Dr. Young's; but far more cha&s;te and delicate. Per&s;picuity, na|tural grace and ea&s;e, always di&s;tingui&s;h his figures. They are neither har&s;h nor &s;train|ed; they never appear to have been &s;tudied or &s;ought after; but &s;eem to ri&s;e of their own accord from the &s;ubject, and con&s;tantly embelli&s;h it.</P>
<P>I HAVE now treated fully of the Metaphor, and the rules that &s;hould govern it, a part of the doctrine of &s;tyle &s;o important, that it required particular illu&s;tration. I have only to add a few words concerning Allegory.</P>
<P>AN Allegory may be regarded as a conti|nued Metaphor; as it is the repre&s;entation of &s;ome one thing by another that re&s;embles it, and that is made to &s;tand for it. Thus,
<PB N="373" REF="379">
in Prior's Henry and Emma, Emma in the following allegorical manner de&s;cribes her con&s;tancy to Henry:<Q><L>Did I but purpo&s;e to embark with thee</L>
<L>On the &s;mooth &s;urface of a &s;ummer's &s;ea,</L>
<L>While gentle zephyrs play with pro&s;perous gales,</L>
<L>And fortune's favour fills the &s;welling &s;ails;</L>
<L>But would for&s;ake the &s;hip, and make the &s;hore,</L>
<L>When the winds whi&s;tle, and the tempe&s;ts roar?</L></Q></P>
<P>WE may take al&s;o from the Scriptures a very fine example of an Allegory, in the 80th P&s;alm; where the people of I&s;rael are repre|&s;ented under the image of a vine, and the figure is &s;upported throughout with great correctne&s;s and beauty; <Q REND="inline">"Thou ha&s;t brought a vine out of Egypt, thou ha&s;t ca&s;t out the heathen, and planted it. Thou pre|pared&s;t room before it, and did&s;t cau&s;e it to take deep root, and it filled the land. The hills were covered with the &s;hadow of it; and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars. She &s;ent out her boughs into the &s;ea, and her branches into the river. Why ha&s;t thou broken down her hedges, &s;o that all they which pa&s;s by the way do pluck her? The boar out of the wood doth wa&s;te it; and the wild bea&s;t of the field doth devour it. Return, we be|&s;eech thee, O God of Ho&s;ts, look down from Heaven, and behold, and vi&s;it this vine!"</Q> Here there is no circum&s;tance (ex|cept perhaps one phra&s;e at the beginning, <Q REND="inline">"thou ha&s;t ca&s;t out the heathen,")</Q> that does
<PB N="374" REF="380">
not &s;trictly agree to a vine, whil&s;t, at the &s;ame time, the whole quadrates happily with the Jewi&s;h &s;tate repre&s;ented by this figure. This is the fir&s;t and principal requi&s;ite in the con|duct of an Allegory, that the figurative and the literal meaning be not mixed incon&s;i&s;t|ently together. For in&s;tance, in&s;tead of de|&s;cribing the vine, as wa&s;ted by the boar from the wood, and devoured by the wild bea&s;t of the field, had the P&s;almi&s;t &s;aid, it was afflict|ed by heathens, or overcome by enemies (which is the real meaning), this would have ruined the Allegory, and produced the &s;ame confu&s;ion, of which I gave examples in Me|taphors, when the figurative and literal &s;en&s;e are mixed and jumbled together. Indeed, the &s;ame rules that were given for Meta|phors, may al&s;o be applied to Allegories, on account of the affinity they bear to each other. The only material difference between them, be&s;ides the one being &s;hort, and the other being prolonged, is, that a Metaphor always explains it&s;elf by the words that are connected with it in their proper and natural meaning; as when I &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Achilles was a Lion;"</Q> an <Q REND="inline">"able Mini&s;ter is the Pillar of the State."</Q> My Lion and my Pillar are &s;ufficiently interpreted by the mention of Achilles and the Mini&s;ter, which I join to them; but an Allegory is, or may be, allow|ed to &s;tand more di&s;connected with the literal meaning; the interpretation not &s;o directly pointed out, but left to our own reflection.</P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="381">
ALLEGORIES were a favourite method of delivering in&s;tructions in ancient times; for what we call Fables or Parables are no other than Allegories; where, by words and acti|ons attributed to bea&s;ts or inanimate objects, the di&s;po&s;itions of men are figured; and what we call the moral, is the unfigured &s;en&s;e or meaning of the Allegory. An Aenigma or Riddle is al&s;o a &s;pecies of Allegory; one thing repre&s;ented or imaged by another; but pur|po&s;ely wrapt up under &s;o many circum&s;tances, as to be rendered ob&s;cure. Where a riddle is not intended, it is always a fault in Alle|gory to be too dark. The meaning &s;hould be ea&s;ily &s;een through the figure employed to &s;hadow it. However the proper mixture of light and &s;hade in &s;uch compo&s;itions, the exact adju&s;tment of all the figurative circum|&s;tances with the literal &s;en&s;e, &s;o as neither to lay the meaning too bare and open, nor to cover and wrap it up too much, has ever been found an affair of great nicety; and there are few &s;pecies of compo&s;ition in which it is more difficult to write &s;o as to plea&s;e and command attention, than in Allegories. In &s;ome of the vi&s;ions of the Spectator, we have examples of Allegories very happily executed.</P>

<HEAD>LECTURE XVI. HYPERBOLE&mdash;PERSONIFICATION&mdash;APOSTROPHE.</HEAD>
<P>THE next figure concerning which I am to treat, is called Hyperbole, or Exag|geration. It con&s;i&s;ts in magnifying an object beyond its natural bounds. It may be con|&s;idered &s;ometimes as a trope, and &s;ometimes as a figure of thought: and here indeed the di&s;tinction between the&s;e two cla&s;&s;es begins not to be clear, nor is it of any importance that we &s;hould have recour&s;e to metaphy&s;i|cal &s;ubtilties, in order to keep them di&s;tinct. Whether we call it trope or figure, it is plain that it is a mode of &s;peech which hath &s;ome foundation in nature. For in all languages, even in common conver&s;ation, hyperbolical expre&s;&s;ions very frequently occur; as &s;wift as the wind; as white as the &s;now, and the like; and our common forms of compliment are almo&s;t all of them extravagant Hyper|boles. If any thing be remarkably good or
<PB N="377" REF="383">
great in its kind, we are in&s;tantly ready to add to it &s;ome exaggerating epithet; and to make it the greate&s;t or be&s;t we ever &s;aw. The imagination has always a tendency to gratify it&s;elf, by magnifying its pre&s;ent ob|ject, and carrying it to exce&s;s. More or le&s;s of this hyperbolical turn will prevail in lan|guage, according to the liveline&s;s of imagina|tion among the people who &s;peak it. Hence young people deal always much in Hyper|boles. Hence the language of the Orientals was far more hyperbolical than that of the Europeans, who are of more phlegmatic, or, if you plea&s;e, of more correct imagination. Hence, among all writers in early times, and in the rude periods of &s;ociety, we may expect this figure to abound. Greater experience, and more cultivated &s;ociety, abate the warmth of imagination, and cha&s;ten the manner of expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE exaggerated expre&s;&s;ions to which our ears are accu&s;tomed in conver&s;ation, &s;carcely &s;trike us as Hyperboles. In an in&s;tant we make the proper abatement, and under&s;tand them according to their ju&s;t value. But when there is &s;omething &s;triking and unu&s;ual in the form of a hyperbolical expre&s;&s;ion, it then ri&s;es into a figure of &s;peech which draws our attention: and here it is nece&s;&s;ary to ob|&s;erve, that unle&s;s the reader's imagination be in &s;uch a &s;tate as di&s;po&s;es it to ri&s;e and &s;well along with the hyperbolical expre&s;&s;ion, he is always hurt and offended by it. For a &s;ort
<PB N="378" REF="384">
of di&s;agreeable force is put upon him; he is required to &s;train and exert his fancy, when he feels no inclination to make any &s;uch ef|fort. Hence the Hyperbole is a figure of difficult management; and ought neither to be frequently u&s;ed, nor long dwelt upon. On &s;ome occa&s;ions, it is undoubtedly pro|per; being, as was before ob&s;erved, the na|tural &s;tyle of a &s;prightly and heated imagin|ation, but when Hyperboles are un&s;ea&s;ona|ble, or too frequent, they render a compo&s;i|tion frigid and unaffecting. They are the re&s;ource of an author of feeble imagination; of one, de&s;cribing objects which either want native dignity in them&s;elves; or who&s;e dig|nity he cannot &s;how by de&s;cribing them &s;im|ply, and in their ju&s;t proportions, and is therefore obliged to re&s;t upon tumid and ex|aggerated expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>HYPERBOLES are of two kinds; either &s;uch as are employed in de&s;cription, or &s;uch as are &s;ugge&s;ted by the warmth of pa&s;&s;ion. The be&s;t by far, are tho&s;e which are the ef|fect of pa&s;&s;ion: for if the imagination has a tendency to magnify its objects beyond their natural proportion, pa&s;&s;ion po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es this ten|dency in a va&s;tly &s;tronger degree; and there|fore not only excu&s;es the mo&s;t daring figures, but very often renders them natural and ju&s;t. All pa&s;&s;ions, without exception, love, terror, amazement, indignation, anger, and even grief, throw the mind into confu&s;ion, aggra|vate their objects, and of cour&s;e prompt a
<PB N="379" REF="385">
hyperbolical &s;tyle. Hence the following &s;en|timents of Satan in Milton, as &s;trongly as they are de&s;cribed, contain nothing but what is natural and proper; exhibiting the picture of a mind agitated with rage and de&s;pair:<Q><L>Me mi&s;erable! which way &s;hall I flie</L>
<L>Infinite wrath, and infinite de&s;pair?</L>
<L>Which way I flie is Hell, my&s;elf am Hell;</L>
<L>And in the lowe&s;t depth, a lower deep</L>
<L>Still threat'ning to devour me, opens wide,</L>
<L>To which the Hell I &s;uffer &s;eems a Heaven.</L>
<BIBL>B. iv. l. 73.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>IN &s;imple de&s;cription, though Hyperboles are not excluded, yet they mu&s;t be u&s;ed with more caution, and require more preparation, in order to make the mind reli&s;h them. Ei|ther the object de&s;cribed mu&s;t be of that kind, which of it&s;elf &s;eizes the fancy &s;trong|ly, and di&s;po&s;es it to run beyond bounds; &s;omething va&s;t, &s;urpri&s;ing, and new; or the writer's art mu&s;t be exerted in heating the fancy gradually, and preparing it to think highly of the object which he intends to ex|aggerate. When a Poet is de&s;cribing an earthquake or a &s;torm, or when he has brought us into the mid&s;t of a battle, we can bear &s;trong Hyperboles without di&s;plea&s;ure. But when he is de&s;cribing only a woman in grief, it is impo&s;&s;ible not to be di&s;gu&s;ted with &s;uch wild exaggeration as the following, in one of our dramatic Poets:<Q><PB N="380" REF="386">
<L>&mdash;I found her on the floor</L>
<L>In all the &s;torm of grief, yet beautiful;</L>
<L>Pouring forth tears at &s;uch a lavi&s;h rate,</L>
<L>That were the world on fire, they might have drown'd</L>
<L>The wrath of Heaven, and quench'd the migh|ty ruin.</L><BIBL>LEE.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>THIS is mere bomba&s;t. The per&s;on her&s;elf who was under the di&s;tracting agitations of grief, might be permitted to hyperbolize &s;trongly; but the &s;pectator de&s;cribing her, cannot be allowed an equal liberty: for this plain rea&s;on, that the one is &s;uppo&s;ed to ut|ter the &s;entiments of pa&s;&s;ion, the other &s;peaks only the language of de&s;cription, which is al|ways, according to the dictates of nature, on a lower tone: a di&s;tinction, which how|ever obvious, has not been attended to by many writers.</P>
<P>HOW far a Hyperbole, &s;uppo&s;ing it pro|perly introduced, may be &s;afely carried with|out over&s;tretching it; what is the proper mea&s;ure and boundary of this figure, cannot, as far as I know, be a&s;certained by any pre|ci&s;e rule. Good &s;en&s;e and ju&s;t ta&s;te mu&s;t determine the point, beyond which, if we pa&s;s, we become extravagant. Lucan may be pointed out as an author apt to be exce&s;|&s;ive in his Hyperboles. Among the compli|ments paid by the Roman Poets to their Em|perors, it had become fa&s;hionable to a&s;k them, what part of the heavens they would chu&s;e
<PB N="381" REF="387">
for their habitation, after they &s;hould have become Gods? Virgil had already carried this &s;ufficiently far in his addre&s;s to Augu&s;tus:
<Q><L>&mdash;Tibi brachia contrahit ingens</L>
<L>Scorpius, &amp; Coeli ju&s;ta plus parte relinquit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>"The Scorpion ready to receive thy laws,</L>
<L>"Yields half his region, and contracts his paws."</L>
<BIBL>DRYDEN.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>."</L>
<BIBL>Georg. I.</BIBL></Q>
But this did not &s;uffice Lucan. Re&s;olved to outdo all his predece&s;&s;ors, in a like addre&s;s to Nero, he very gravely be&s;eeches him not to choo&s;e his place near either of the poles, but to be &s;ure to occupy ju&s;t the middle of the heavens, le&s;t, by going either to one &s;ide or other, his weight &s;hould over&s;et the uni|ver&s;e:<Q><L>Sed neque in Arctoo &s;edem tibi legeris orbe</L>

<L>Pre&s;s not too much on any part the &s;phere,</L>
<L>Hard were the ta&s;k thy weight divine to bear;</L>
<L>Soon would the axis feel the unu&s;ual load,</L>

Such thoughts as the&s;e, are what the French call <HI>outr&eacute;s,</HI> and always proceed from a fal&s;e fire of genius. The Spani&s;h and African writers, as Tertullian, Cyprian, Augu&s;tin, are remarked for being fond of them. As in that epitaph on Charles V. by a Spani&s;h writer:
<Q><L>Pro tumulo ponas orbem, pro tegmine coelum,</L>
<L>Sidera pro facibus, pro lacrymis maria.</L></Q>
Sometimes they dazzle and impo&s;e by their boldne&s;s; but wherever rea&s;on and good &s;en&s;e are &s;o much violated, there can be no true beauty. Epigrammatic writers are frequent|ly guilty in this re&s;pect; re&s;ting the whole merit of their epigrams on &s;ome extravagant hyperbolical turn; &s;uch as the following of Dr. Pitcairn's, upon Holland's being gained from the ocean:<Q><L>Tellurem fecere Dii; &s;ua littora Belgae;</L>
<L>Immen&s;aeque molis opus utrumque fuit;</L>
<L>Dii vacuo &s;par&s;as glomerarunt aethere terras,</L>
<L>Nil ibi quod operi po&s;&s;it obe&s;&s;e fuit.</L>
<L>At Belgis, maria &amp; coeli naturaque rerum</L>
<L>Ob&s;titit; ob&s;tantes hi domu&ecirc;re Deos.</L></Q> So much for the Hyperbole. We proceed now to tho&s;e figures which lie altogether in the thought; where the words are taken in their common and literal &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e, the fir&s;t place is unque&s;ti|onably due to Per&s;onification, or that figure
<PB N="383" REF="389">
by which we attribute life and action to ina|nimate objects. The technical term for this is Pro&s;opopoia; but as Per&s;onification is of the &s;ame import, and more allied to our own language, it will be better to u&s;e this word.</P>
<P>IT is a figure, the u&s;e of which is very exten&s;ive, and its foundation laid deep in human nature. At fir&s;t view, and when con&s;idered ab&s;tractly, it would appear to be a figure of the utmo&s;t boldne&s;s, and to bor|der on the extravagant and ridiculous. For what can &s;eem more remote from the tract of rea&s;onable thought, than to &s;peak of &s;tones and trees, and fields and rivers, as if they were living creatures, and to attribute to them thought and &s;en&s;ation, affections and actions? One might imagine this to be no more than childi&s;h conceit, which no per&s;on of ta&s;te could reli&s;h. In fact, however, the ca&s;e is very different. No &s;uch ridiculous effect is produced by Per&s;onification, when properly employed; on the contrary, it is found to be natural and agreeable; nor is any very uncommon degree of pa&s;&s;ion required, in order to make us reli&s;h it. All poetry, even in its mo&s;t gentle and humble forms, abounds with it. From pro&s;e, it is far from being excluded; nay, in common conver&s;a|tion, very frequent approaches are made to it. When we &s;ay, the ground <HI>thir&s;ts</HI> for rain, or the earth <HI>&s;miles</HI> with plenty; when we &s;peak of ambitions being <HI>re&s;tle&s;s,</HI> or a di&s;ea&s;e being <HI>deceitful,</HI> &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions &s;how the
<PB N="384" REF="390">
facility with which the mind can accommo|date the properties of living creatures to things that are inanimate, or to ab&s;tract con|ceptions of its own forming.</P>
<P>INDEED, it is very remarkable, that there is a wonderful pronene&s;s in human nature to animate all objects. Whether this ari&s;es from a &s;ort of a&s;&s;imilating principle, from a pro|pen&s;ion to &s;pread a re&s;emblance of our&s;elves over all other things, or from whatever other cau&s;e it ari&s;es, &s;o it is, that almo&s;t every emotion, which in the lea&s;t agitates the mind, be&s;tows upon its object a momentary idea of life. Let a man, by an unwary &s;tep, &s;prain his ankle, or hurt his foot upon a &s;tone, and, in the ruffled di&s;compo&s;ed moment, he will, &s;ometimes, feel him&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed to break the &s;tone in pieces, or to utter pa&s;&s;ionate expre&s;|&s;ions again&s;t it, as if it had done him an in|jury. If one has been long accu&s;tomed to a certain &s;et of objects, which have made a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion on his imagination; as to a hou&s;e, where he has pa&s;&s;ed many agreeable years; or to fields, and trees, and mountains, among which he has often walked with the greate&s;t delight; when he is obliged to part with them, e&s;pecially if he has no pro&s;pect of ever &s;eeing them again, he can &s;carce avoid having &s;omewhat of the &s;ame feeling as when he is leaving old friends. They &s;eem endow|ed with life. They become objects of his affection; and, in the moment of his part|ing, it &s;carce &s;eems ab&s;urd to him, to give
<PB N="385" REF="391">
vent to his feeling in words, and to take a formal adieu.</P>
<P>So &s;trong is that impre&s;&s;ion of life which is made upon us, by the more magnificent and &s;triking objects of nature e&s;pecially, that I doubt not, in the lea&s;t, of this having been one cau&s;e of the multiplication of divinities in the Heathen world. Dryads and Naiads, the Genius of the wood, and the God of the river, were, in men of lively imaginations, in the early ages of the world, ea&s;ily grafted upon this turn of mind. When their favou|rite rural objects had often been animated in their fancy, it was an ea&s;y tran&s;ition to at|tribute to them &s;ome real divinity, &s;ome un|&s;een power or genius which inhabited them, or in &s;ome peculiar manner belonged to them. Imagination was highly gratified, by thus gaining &s;omewhat to re&s;t upon with more &s;ta|bility; and when belief coincided &s;o much with imagination, very &s;light cau&s;es would be &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h it.</P>
<P>FROM this deduction, may be ea&s;ily &s;een how it comes to pa&s;s, that per&s;onification makes &s;o great a figure in all compo&s;itions, where imagination or pa&s;&s;ion have any con|cern. On innumerable occa&s;ions, it is the very Language of imagination and pa&s;&s;ion, and, therefore, de&s;erves to be attended to, and examined with peculiar care. There are three different degrees of this figure; which it is nece&s;&s;ary to remark and di&s;tingui&s;h, in
<PB N="386" REF="392">
order to determine the propriety of its u&s;e. The fir&s;t is, when &s;ome of the properties or qualities of living creatures are a&s;cribed to in|animate objects; the &s;econd, when tho&s;e in|animate objects are introduced as acting like &s;uch as have life; and the third, when they are repre&s;ented, either as &s;peaking to us, or as li&s;tening to what we &s;ay to them.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t, and lowe&s;t degree of this figure, con&s;i&s;ts in a&s;cribing to inanimate objects &s;ome of the qualities of living creatures. Where this is done, as is mo&s;t commonly the ca&s;e, in a word, or two, and by way of an epi|thet added to the object, as, <Q REND="inline">"a raging &s;torm, a deceitful di&s;ea&s;e, a cruel di&s;a&s;ter," &amp;c.</Q> it rai&s;es the &s;tyle &s;o little, that the hum|ble&s;t di&s;cour&s;e will admit it without any force. This, indeed, is &s;uch an ob&s;cure de|gree of Per&s;onification, that one may doubt whether it de&s;erves the name, and might not be cla&s;&s;ed with &s;imple Metaphors, which e&s;cape in a manner unnoticed. Happily em|ployed, however, it &s;ometimes adds beauty and &s;prightline&s;s to an expre&s;&s;ion; as in this line of Virgil:
<Q><L>Aut conjurato de&s;cendens Dacus ab I&s;tro.</L>
<BIBL>Geor. II. 474.</BIBL></Q>
Where the per&s;onal epithet, <HI>conjurato,</HI> applied to the river <HI>I&s;tro,</HI> is infinitely more poetical than if it had been applied to the per&s;on, thus:
<Q><PB N="387" REF="393">

<P>THE next degree of this figure is, when we introduce inanimate objects acting like tho&s;e that have life. Here we ri&s;e a &s;tep higher, and the Per&s;onification becomes &s;en|&s;ible. According to the nature of the action, which we attribute to tho&s;e inanimate ob|jects, and the particularity with which we de&s;cribe it, &s;uch is the &s;trength of the figure. When pur&s;ued to any length, it belongs only to &s;tudied harangues, to highly figured and eloquent di&s;cour&s;e; when &s;lightly touched, it may be admitted into &s;ubjects of le&s;s eleva|tion. Cicero, for in&s;tance, &s;peaking of the ca&s;es where killing another is lawful in &s;elf|defence, u&s;es the following words: <Q REND="inline">"Aliquan|do nobis gladius ad occidendum hominem ab ip&s;is porrigitur legibus." <BIBL>(Orat. pro Milone.)</BIBL></Q> The expre&s;&s;ion is happy. The laws are per&s;onified, as reaching forth their hand to give us a &s;word for putting one to death. Such &s;hort per&s;onifications as the&s;e may be admitted, even into moral treati&s;es, or works of cool rea&s;oning; and, provided they be ea&s;y and not &s;trained, and that we be not cloyed with too frequent returns of them, they have a good effect on &s;tyle, and render it both &s;trong and lively.</P>
<P><PB N="388" REF="394">
THE genius of our Language gives us an advantage in the u&s;e of this figure. As, with us, no &s;ub&s;tantive nouns have gender, or are ma&s;culine and feminine, except the proper names of male and female creatures; by giving a gender to any inanimate object, or ab&s;tract idea, that is, in place of the pronoun <HI>it,</HI> u&s;ing the per&s;onal pronouns, <HI>he</HI> or <HI>&s;he,</HI> we pre&s;ently rai&s;e the &s;tyle, and begin per|&s;onification. In &s;olemn di&s;cour&s;e, this can often be done to good purpo&s;e, when &s;peak|ing of religion, or virtue, or our country, or any &s;uch object of dignity. I &s;hall give a remarkably fine example, from a &s;ermon of Bi&s;hop Sherlock's, where we &s;hall &s;ee natu|ral religion beautifully per&s;onified, and be able to judge from it, of the &s;pirit and grace which this figure, when well conducted, be|&s;tows on a di&s;cour&s;e. I mu&s;t take notice, at the &s;ame time, that it is an in&s;tance of this figure, carried as far as pro&s;e, even in its highe&s;t elevation, will admit, and, there|fore, &s;uited only to compo&s;itions where the great efforts of eloquence are allowed. The Author is comparing together our Saviour and Mahomet: <Q REND="inline">"Go,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">"to your natural Religion; lay before her Mahomet, and his di&s;ciples, arrayed in armour and blood, riding in triumph over the &s;poils of thou&s;ands who fell by his victorious &s;word. Shew her the cities which he &s;et in flames, the countries which he ravaged and de|&s;troyed, and the mi&s;erable di&s;tre&s;s of all the inhabitants of the earth. When &s;he
<PB N="389" REF="395">
has viewed him in this &s;cene, carry her in|to his retirement; &s;hew her the Prophet's chamber; his concubines and his wives; and let her hear him allege revelation, and a divine commi&s;&s;ion, to ju&s;tify his adultery and lu&s;t. When &s;he is tired with this pro|&s;pect, then &s;hew her the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, humble and meek, doing good to all the &s;ons of men. Let her &s;ee him in his mo&s;t retired privacies; let her follow him to the mount, and hear his devotions and &s;up|plications to God. Carry her to his table, to view his poor fare; and hear his heaven|ly di&s;cour&s;e. Let her attend him to the tribunal, and con&s;ider the patience with which he endured the &s;coffs and reproaches of his enemies. Lead her to his cro&s;s; let her view him in the agony of death, and hear his la&s;t prayer for his per&s;ecutors; <HI>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do!</HI>&mdash;When Natural Religion has thus viewed both, a&s;k, her, Which is the Prophet of God? But her an&s;wer we have already had, when &s;he &s;aw part of this &s;cene, through the eyes of the Centu|rion, who attended at the cro&s;s. By him &s;he &s;poke, and &s;aid, <HI>Truly, this man was the Son of God</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bi&s;hop Sherlock's Sermons, Vol. I. Di&s;c. ix.</NOTE>."</Q> This is more than ele|gant; it is truly &s;ublime. The whole pa&s;|&s;age is animated; and the figure ri&s;es at the conclu&s;ion, when Natural Religion, who, before was only a &s;pectator, is introduced as

<PB N="390" REF="396">
&s;peaking by the Centurion's voice. It has the better effect too, that it occurs at the conclu&s;ion of a di&s;cour&s;e, where we natural|ly look for mo&s;t warmth and dignity. Did Bi&s;hop Sherlock's &s;ermons, or, indeed, any Engli&s;h &s;ermons whatever, afford us many pa&s;&s;ages equal to this, we &s;hould oftner have recour&s;e to them for in&s;tances of the beauty of Compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>HITHER TO we have &s;poken of pro&s;e; in poetry, Per&s;onifications of this kind are ex|tremely frequent, and are, indeed, the life and &s;oul of it. We expect to find every thing animated in the de&s;criptions of a poet who has a lively fancy. Accordingly Homer, the father and prince of poets, is remarkable for the u&s;e of this figure. War, peace, darts, &s;pears, towns, rivers, every thing, in &s;hort, is alive in his writings. The &s;ame is the ca&s;e with Milton and Shake&s;peare. No Per&s;oni|fication, in any author, is more &s;triking, or introduced on a more proper occa&s;ion, than the following of Milton's, on occa&s;ion of Eve's eating the forbidden fruit:<Q><L>So &s;aying, her ra&s;h hand, in evil hour</L>
<L>Forth reaching to the fruit, &s;he pluck'd, &s;he eat;</L>
<L>Earth felt the wound; and nature, from her &s;eat</L>
<L>Sighing, through all her works, gave &s;igns of woe,</L>
<L>That all was lo&s;t.&mdash;</L><BIBL>ix. 780.</BIBL></Q> All the circum&s;tances and ages of men, po|verty, riches, youth, old age, all the di&s;po&s;i|tions
<PB N="391" REF="397">
and pa&s;&s;ions, melancholy, love, grief, contentment, are capable of being per&s;onifi|ed in poetry, with great propriety. Of this, we meet with frequent examples in Milton's Allegro and Pen&s;ero&s;o, Parnell's Hymn to Contentment, Thom&s;on's Sea&s;ons, and all the good poets: nor, indeed, is it ea&s;y to &s;et any bounds to Per&s;onifications of this kind, in poetry.</P>
<P>ONE of the greate&s;t plea&s;ures we receive from poetry, is, to find our&s;elves always in the mid&s;t of our fellows; and to &s;ee every thing thinking, feeling, and acting, as we our&s;elves do. This is, perhaps, the principal charm of this &s;ort of figured &s;tyle, that it in|troduces us into &s;ociety with all nature, and intere&s;ts us, even in inanimate objects, by forming a connection between them and us, through that &s;en&s;ibility which it a&s;cribes to them. This is exemplified in the following beautiful pa&s;&s;age of Thom&s;on's Summer, wherein the life which he be&s;tows upon all nature, when de&s;cribing the effects of the ri&s;ing &s;un, renders the &s;cenery uncommonly gay and intere&s;ting:<Q><L>But yonder comes the powerful king of day</L>
<L>Rejoicing in the ea&s;t. The le&s;&s;ening cloud,</L>
<L>The kindling azure and the mountain's brim</L>
<L>Tipt with aethereal gold, his near approach</L>
<L>Betoken glad.&mdash;</L>
<L>&mdash;By thee refined,</L>
<L>In bri&s;ker mea&s;ures, the relucent &s;tream</L>
<L>Fri&s;ks o'er the mead. The precipice abrupt,</L>
<L><PB N="392" REF="398">
Projecting horror on the blacken'd flood,</L>
<L>Softens at thy return. The de&s;art joys,</L>
<L>Wildly, through all his melancholy bounds.</L>
<L>Rude ruins glitter; and the briny deep,</L>
<L>Seen from &s;ome pointed promontory's top,</L>
<L>Reflects from every fluctuating wave,</L>
<L>A glance exten&s;ive as the day.&mdash;</L></Q> The &s;ame effect is remarkable in that fine pa&s;&s;age of Milton:<Q><L>&mdash;To the nuptial bower,</L>
<L>I led her blu&s;hing like the morn. All heaven</L>
<L>And happy con&s;tellations, on that hour,</L>
<L>Shed their &s;electe&s;t influence. The earth</L>
<L>Gave &s;igns of gratulation, and each hill.</L>
<L>Joyous the birds; fre&s;h gales and gentle airs</L>
<L>Whi&s;pered it to the woods, and from their wings</L>
<L>Flung ro&s;e, flung odour from the &s;picy &s;hrub,</L>
<L>Di&s;porting.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>THE third and highe&s;t degree of this fi|gure remains to be mentioned, when inani|mate objects are introduced, not only as feeling and acting, but as &s;peaking to us, or hearing and li&s;tening when we addre&s;s our|&s;elves to them. This, though on &s;everal oc|ca&s;ions far from being unnatural, is, how|ever, more difficult in the execution, than the other kinds of Per&s;onification. For this is plainly the bolde&s;t of all rhetorical figures; it is the &s;tyle of a &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion only; and, therefore, never to be attempted, unle&s;s when the mind is con&s;iderably heated and agitated. A &s;light Per&s;onification of &s;ome inanimate thing, acting as if it had life, can be reli&s;hed
<PB N="393" REF="399">
by the mind, in the mid&s;t of cool de&s;cription, and when its ideas are going on in the ordi|nary train. But it mu&s;t be in a &s;tate of vio|lent emotion, and have departed con&s;idera|bly from its common tract of thought, be|fore it can &s;o far reali&s;e the Per&s;onification of an in&s;en&s;ible object, as to conceive it li&s;ten|ing to what we &s;ay, or making any return to us. All &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, however, have a tendency to u&s;e this figure; not only love, anger, and indignation, but even tho&s;e which are &s;eemingly more di&s;piriting, &s;uch as, grief, remor&s;e, and melancholy. For all pa&s;&s;ions &s;truggle for vent, and if they can find no other object, will, rather than be &s;ilent, pour them&s;elves forth to woods, and rocks, and the mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible things; e&s;pecially, if the&s;e be any how connected with the cau&s;es and objects that have thrown the mind into this agitation. Hence, in poetry, where the great|e&s;t liberty is allowed to the Language of pa&s;|&s;ion, it is ea&s;y to produce many beautiful examples of this figure. Milton affords us an extremely fine one, in that moving and ten|der addre&s;s which Eve makes to Paradi&s;e, ju&s;t before &s;he is compelled to leave it.<Q><L>Oh! unexpected &s;troke, wor&s;e than of death!</L>
<L>Mu&s;t I thus leave thee, Paradi&s;e! thus leave</L>
<L>Thee, native &s;oil, the&s;e happy walks, and &s;hades,</L>
<L>Fit haunt of Gods! where I had hope to &s;pend</L>
<L>Quiet, though &s;ad, the re&s;pite of that day,</L>
<L>Which mu&s;t be mortal to us both. O flowers!</L>
<L>That never will in other climate grow,</L>
<L>My early vi&s;itation, and my la&s;t</L>
<L><PB N="394" REF="400">
At ev'n, which I bred up with tender hand,</L>
<L>From your fir&s;t op'ning buds, and gave you names!</L>

<L>Your tribes, and water from the ambro&s;ial fount?</L>
<BIBL>Book II. l. 268.</BIBL></Q> This is altogether the language of nature, and of female pa&s;&s;ion. It is ob&s;ervable, that all plaintive pa&s;&s;ions are peculiarly prone to the u&s;e of this figure. The complaints which Philoctetes, in Sophocles, pours out to the rocks and caves of Lemnos, amid&s;t the ex|ce&s;s of his grief and de&s;pair, are remarkably fine examples of it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 line"></L>

<L>"My &s;ad complaints, and I will tell you all</L>
<L>"That I have &s;uffered from Achilles' &s;on!"</L>
<BIBL>FRANKLIN.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. And there are fre|quent examples, not in poetry only, but in real life, of per&s;ons, when ju&s;t about to &s;uf|fer death, taking a pa&s;&s;ionate farewell of the &s;un, moon, and &s;tars, or other &s;en&s;ible ob|jects around them.</P>
<P>THERE are two great rules for the manage|ment of this &s;ort of Per&s;onification. The fir&s;t rule is, never to attempt it, unle&s;s when prompted by &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion, and never to con|tinue it when the pa&s;&s;ion begins to flag. It is one of tho&s;e high ornaments, which can
<PB N="395" REF="401">
only find place in the mo&s;t warm and &s;pirited parts of compo&s;ition; and there, too, mu&s;t be employed with moderation.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd rule is, never to per&s;onify any object in this way, but &s;uch as has &s;ome dig|nity in it&s;elf, and can make a proper figure in this elevation to which we rai&s;e it. The ob|&s;ervance of this rule is required, even in the lower degrees of Per&s;onification; but &s;till more, when an addre&s;s is made to the per&s;onified object. To addre&s;s the corp&s;e of a decea&s;ed friend, is natural; but to addre&s;s the clothes which he wore, introduces mean and degrad|ing ideas. So al&s;o, addre&s;&s;ing the &s;everal parts of one's body, as if they were animat|ed, is not congruous to the dignity of pa&s;&s;i|on. For this rea&s;on, I mu&s;t condemn the following pa&s;&s;age, in a very beautiful Poem of Mr. Pope's, Eloi&s;a to Abelard.<Q><L>Dear fatal name! re&s;t ever unreveal'd,</L>
<L>Nor pa&s;s the&s;e lips in holy &s;ilence &s;ealed.</L>
<L>Hide it, my heart, within that clo&s;e di&s;gui&s;e,</L>
<L>Where, mixed with Gods, his lov'd idea lies:</L>
<L>Oh! write it not, my hand!&mdash;his name appears</L>
<L>Already written&mdash;Blot it out, my tears!</L></Q> Here are &s;everal different objects and parts of the body per&s;onified; and each of them are addre&s;&s;ed or &s;poken to; let us con&s;ider with what propriety. The fir&s;t is, the name of Abelard: <Q REND="inline">"Dear fatal name! re&s;t ever," &amp;c.</Q> To this, no rea&s;onable objection can be made. For, as the name of a per&s;on often &s;tands
<PB N="396" REF="402">
for the per&s;on him&s;elf, and &s;ugge&s;ts the &s;ame ideas, it can bear this Per&s;onification with &s;ufficient dignity. Next, Eloi&s;a &s;peaks to her&s;elf; and per&s;onifies her heart for this pur|po&s;e: <Q REND="inline">"Hide it, my heart, within that clo&s;e," &amp;c.</Q> As the heart is a dignified part of the human frame, and is often put for the mind, or affections, this al&s;o may pa&s;s without blame. But, when from her heart &s;he pa&s;&s;es to her hand, and tells her hand not to write his name, this is forced and unnatural; a per|&s;onified hand is low, and not in the &s;tyle of true pa&s;&s;ion: and the figure becomes &s;till wor&s;e, when, in the la&s;t place, &s;he exhorts her tears to blot out what her hand had written: <Q REND="inline">"Oh! write it not," &amp;c.</Q> There is, in the&s;e two lines, an air of epigrammatic conceit, which native pa&s;&s;ion never &s;ugge&s;ts; and which is altogether un&s;uitable to the tender|ne&s;s which breathes through the re&s;t of that exellent Poem.</P>
<P>IN pro&s;e compo&s;itions, this figure requires to be u&s;ed with &s;till greater moderation and delicacy. The &s;ame liberty is not allowed to the imagination there, as in poetry. The &s;ame a&s;&s;i&s;tances cannot be obtained for rai&s;ing pa&s;&s;ion to its proper height by the force of numbers, and the glow of &s;tyle. However, addre&s;&s;es to inanimate objects are not ex|cluded from pro&s;e; but have their place only in the higher &s;pecies of oratory. A public Speaker may on &s;ome occa&s;ions very properly addre&s;s religion or virtue; or his native coun|try,
<PB N="397" REF="403">
or &s;ome city or province, which has &s;uf|fered perhaps great calamities, or been the &s;cene of &s;ome memorable action. But we mu&s;t remember, that as &s;uch addre&s;&s;es are among the highe&s;t efforts of eloquence, they &s;hould never be attempted, unle&s;s by per&s;ons of more than ordinary genius. For if the orator fails in his de&s;ign of moving our pa&s;|&s;ions by them, he is &s;ure of being laughed at. Of all frigid things, the mo&s;t frigid, are the awkward and un&s;ea&s;onable attempts &s;ome|times made towards &s;uch kinds of Per&s;onifi|cation, e&s;pecially if they be long continued. We &s;ee the writer or &s;peaker toiling and la|bouring, to expre&s;s the language of &s;ome pa&s;|&s;ion, which he neither feels him&s;elf, nor can make us feel. We remain not only cold, but frozen; and are at full lei&s;ure to critici&s;e on the ridiculous figure which the per&s;onified object makes, when we ought to have been tran&s;ported with a glow of enthu&s;ia&s;m. Some of the French writers, particularly Bo&s;&s;uet and Flechier, in their &s;ermons and funeral orations, have attempted and executed this figure, not without warmth and dignity. Their works are exceedingly worthy of being con&s;ulted, for in&s;tances of this, and of &s;everal other ornaments of &s;tyle. Indeed the viva|city and ardour of the French genius is more &s;uited to this animated kind of oratory, than the more correct but more phlegmatic genius of the Briti&s;h, who in their pro&s;e works very rarely attempt any of the high figures of elo|quence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the "Orai&s;ons Funebres de M. Bo&s;&s;uet," which I con|&s;ider as one of the ma&s;ter-pieces of modern eloquence, Apo&s;tro|phes and addre&s;&s;es, to per&s;onified objects, frequently occur, and are &s;upported with much &s;pirit. Thus, for in&s;tance, in the funeral oration of Mary of Au&s;tria, Queen of France, the au|thor addre&s;&s;es Algiers, in the pro&s;pect of the advantage which the arms of Louis XIV. were to gain over it: <Q REND="inline">"Avant lui la France, pre&s;que &s;ans vai&s;&s;eaux, tenoit en vain aux deux mers.

Louis a bri&s;&eacute; les fers, dont tu acablois &s;es &s;ujets, &amp;c."</Q> In another pa&s;&s;age of the &s;ame oration, he thus apo&s;trophizes the I&s;le of Phea&s;ants, which had been rendered famous by being the &s;cene of tho&s;e conferences, in which the treaty of the Pyrenees between France and Spain, and the marriage of this Prince&s;s with the King of France, were con|cluded. <Q REND="inline">"I&s;le pacifique o&ugrave; &s;e doivent terminer les differends de deux grands empires a qui tu &s;ers de limites: i&s;le eter|nellement memorable par les conferences de deux grands mi|ni&s;tres.&mdash;Augu&s;te journ&eacute;e o&ugrave; deux fieres nations, long tems ennemis, et alors reconcilie&eacute;s par Marie There&s;e s'a|van&ccedil;ent &s;ur leur confins, leur rois &agrave; leur t&ecirc;te, non plus pour &s;e combattre, mais pour s'embra&s;&s;er&mdash;"F&ecirc;tes &s;acr&eacute;es, ma|riage fortun&eacute;, voile nuptial, benediction, &s;acrifice, puis-je meler aujourdhui vos ceremonies, et vos pompes, avec ces pompes funebres, &amp; le comble des grandeurs avec leur ruines!"</Q> In the funeral oration of Henrietta, Queen of England (which is perhaps the noble&s;t of all his compo&s;itions), after recounting all &s;he had done to &s;upport her unfortunate hu&s;band, he concludes with this beautiful Apo&s;trophe: <Q REND="inline">"O m&egrave;re!

APOSTROPHE is a figure &s;o much of the &s;ame kind, that it will not require many words. It is an addre&s;s to a real per&s;on; but one who is either ab&s;ent or dead, as if he were pre&s;ent, and li&s;tening to us. It is &s;o much allied to an addre&s;s to inanimate objects per|&s;onified, that both the&s;e figures are &s;ometimes called apo&s;trophes. However, the proper Apo&s;trophe is in boldne&s;s one degree lower than the addre&s;s to per&s;onified objects; for it certainly requires a le&s;s effort of imagina|tion to &s;uppo&s;e per&s;ons pre&s;ent who are dead or ab&s;ent, than to animate in&s;en&s;ible beings, and direct our di&s;cour&s;e to them. Both fi|gures are &s;ubject to the &s;ame rule of being prompted by pa&s;&s;ion, in order to render them natural; for both are the language of pa&s;&s;ion or &s;trong emotions only.

and none hindereth. The whole earth is at re&s;t, and is quiet: they break forth into &s;inging. Yea, the fir-trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars of Lebanon, &s;aying, &s;ince thou art laid down, no feller is come up again&s;t us. Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming: it &s;tir|reth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth: it hath rai&s;ed up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.

<HEAD>LECTURE XVII. COMPARISON, ANTITHESIS, INTER|ROGATION, EXCLAMATION, AND OTHER FIGURES OF SPEECH.</HEAD>
<P>WE are &s;till engaged in the con&s;ideration of figures of &s;peech; which, as they add much to the beauty of &s;tyle when pro|perly employed, and are at the &s;ame time liable to be greatly abu&s;ed, require a careful di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. As it would be tedious to dwell on all the variety of figurative expre&s;&s;ions which rhetoricians have enumerated, I cho&s;e to &s;elect the capital figures, &s;uch as occur mo&s;t frequently, and to make my remarks on the&s;e; the principles and rules laid down con|cerning them, will &s;ufficiently direct as to the u&s;e of the re&s;t, either in pro&s;e or poetry. Of Metaphor, which is the mo&s;t common of them all, I treated fully; and in the la&s;t Lecture I di&s;cour&s;ed of Hyperbole, Per&s;onification, and Apo&s;trophe. This Lecture will nearly fini&s;h what remains on the head of Figures.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="411">
COMPARISON, or &s;imile, is what I am to treat of fir&s;t: a Figure frequently employed both by Poets and Pro&s;e writers, for the or|nament of Compo&s;ition. In a former Lec|ture, I explained fully the difference betwixt this and Metaphor. A Metaphor is a com|pari&s;ed implied, but not expre&s;&s;ed as &s;uch; as when I &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Achilles is a Lion,"</Q> mean|ing, that he re&s;embles one in courage or &s;trength. A Compari&s;on is, when the re|&s;emblance between two objects is expre&s;&s;ed in form, and generally pur&s;ued more fully than the nature of a Metaphor admits; as when I &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"The actions of princes are like tho&s;e great rivers, the cour&s;e of which eve|ry one beholds, but their &s;prings have been &s;een by few."</Q> This &s;light in&s;tance will &s;how, that a happy Compari&s;on is a kind of &s;parkling ornament, which adds not a little lu&s;tre and beauty to di&s;cour&s;e; and hence &s;uch figures are termed by Cicero, <Q REND="inline">"Oratio|nis lumina."</Q></P>
<P>THE plea&s;ure we take in compari&s;ons is ju&s;t and natural. We may remark three dif|ferent &s;ources whence it ari&s;es. Fir&s;t, from the plea&s;ure which nature has annexed to that act of the mind by which we compare any two objects together, trace re&s;emblances among tho&s;e that are different, and differ|ences among tho&s;e that re&s;emble each other; a plea&s;ure, the final cau&s;e of which is, to prompt us to remark and ob&s;erve, and there|by
<PB N="406" REF="412">
to make us advance in u&s;eful knowledge. This operation of the mind is naturally and univer&s;ally agreeable; as appears from the delight which even children have in compar|ing things together, as &s;oon as they are ca|pable of attending to the objects that &s;ur|round them. Secondly, The plea&s;ure of Com|pari&s;on ari&s;es from the illu&s;tration which the &s;imile employed gives to the principal object; from the clearer view of it which it pre&s;ents; or the more &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion of it which it &s;tamps upon the mind: and, thirdly, It ari&s;es from the introduction of a new, and com|monly a &s;plendid object, a&s;&s;ociated to the principal one of which we treat; and from the agreeable picture which that object pre|&s;ents to the fancy; new &s;cenes being there|by brought into view, which, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of this figure, we could not have enjoyed.</P>
<P>ALL Compari&s;ons whatever may be re|duced under two heads, <HI>Explaining</HI> and <HI>Em|belli&s;hing</HI> Compari&s;ons. For when a writer likens the object of which he treats to any other thing, it always is, or at lea&s;t always &s;hould be, with a view either to make us un|der&s;tand that object more di&s;tinctly, or to dre&s;s it up, and adorn it. All manner of &s;ubjects admit of Explaining Compari&s;ons. Let an author be rea&s;oning ever &s;o &s;trictly, or treating the mo&s;t ab&s;tru&s;e point in philo|&s;ophy, he may very properly introduce a
<PB N="407" REF="413">
Compari&s;on, merely with a view to make his &s;ubject be better under&s;tood. Of this nature, is the following in Mr. Harris's Hermes, employed to explain a very ab&s;tract point, the di&s;tinction between the powers of &s;en&s;e and imagination in the human mind. <Q REND="inline">"As wax,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">"would not be adequate to the purpo&s;e of &s;ignatures, if it had not the power to retain as well as to receive the impre&s;&s;ion, the &s;ame holds of the &s;oul with re&s;pect to &s;en&s;e and imagination. Sen&s;e is its receptive power; imagination its retentive. Had it &s;en&s;e without ima|gination, it would not be as wax, but as water, where, though all impre&s;&s;ions be in&s;tantly made, yet as &s;oon as they are made, they are in&s;tantly lo&s;t."</Q> In Com|pari&s;ons of this nature, the under&s;tanding is concerned much more than the fancy: and therefore the only rules to be ob&s;erved, with re&s;pect to them, are, that they be clear, and that they be u&s;eful; that they tend to ren|der our conception of the principal object more di&s;tinct; and that they do not lead our view a&s;ide, and bewilder it with any fal&s;e light.</P>
<P>BUT embelli&s;hing Compari&s;ons, introduced not &s;o much with a view to inform and in|&s;truct, as to adorn the &s;ubject of which we treat, are tho&s;e with which we are chiefly concerned at pre&s;ent, as figures of &s;peech; and tho&s;e, indeed, which mo&s;t frequently
<PB N="408" REF="414">
occur. Re&s;emblance, as I before mentioned, is the foundation of this Figure. We mu&s;t not, however, take Re&s;emblance, in too &s;trict a &s;en&s;e, for actual &s;imilitude or likene&s;s of appearance. Two objects may &s;ometimes be very happily compared to one another, though they re&s;emble each other, &s;trictly &s;peaking, in nothing; only, becau&s;e they agree in the effects which they produce upon the mind; becau&s;e they rai&s;e a train of &s;imilar, or, what may be called, concordant ideas; &s;o that the remembrance of the one, when recalled, &s;erves to &s;trengthen the impre&s;&s;ion made by the other. For example, to de&s;cribe the na|ture of &s;oft and melancholy mu&s;ic, O&s;&s;ian &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"The mu&s;ic of Carryl was, like the memory of joys that are pa&s;t, plea&s;ant and mournful to the &s;oul."</Q> This is happy and delicate. Yet, &s;urely, no kind of mu&s;ic has any re&s;emblance to a feeling of the mind, &s;uch as the memory of pa&s;t joys. Had it been compared to the voice of the nightin|gale, or the murmur of the &s;tream, as it would have been by &s;ome ordinary poet, the likene&s;s would have been more &s;trict; but, by founding his &s;imile upon the effect which Carryl's mu&s;ic produced, the Poet, while he conveys a very tender image, gives us, at the &s;ame time, a much &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion of the nature and &s;train of that mu&s;ic: <Q REND="inline">"Like the memory of joys that are pa&s;t, plea&s;ant and mournful to the &s;oul."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="409" REF="415">
IN general, whether Compari&s;ons be found|ed on the &s;imilitude of the two objects com|pared, or on &s;ome analogy and agreement in their effects, the fundamental requi&s;ite of a compari&s;on is, that it &s;hall &s;erve to illu&s;trate the object, for the &s;ake of which it is intro|duced, and to give us a &s;tronger conception of it. Some little excur&s;ions of Fancy may be permitted, in pur&s;uing the &s;imile; but they mu&s;t never deviate far from the princi|pal object. If it be a great and noble one, every circum&s;tance in the compari&s;on mu&s;t tend to aggrandi&s;e it; if it be a beautiful one, to render it more amiable; if terrible, to fill us with more awe. But to be a little more particular: The rules to be given con|cerning Compari&s;ons, re&s;pect chiefly two ar|ticles; the propriety of their introduction, and the nature of the objects whence they are taken.</P>
<P>FIRST, the propriety of their introduction. From what has been already &s;aid of Compa|ri&s;ons, it appears, that they are not, like the Figures of which I treated in the la&s;t Lec|ture, the language of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion. No; they are the language of imagination rather than of pa&s;&s;ion; of an imagination &s;prightly, indeed, and warmed; but undi&s;turbed by any violent or agitating emotion. Strong pa&s;&s;ion is too &s;evere to admit this play of Fancy. It has no lei&s;ure to ca&s;t about for re&s;embling objects; it dwells on that object
<PB N="410" REF="416">
which has &s;eized and taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;oul. It is too much occupied and filled by it, to turn its view a&s;ide, or to fix its atten|tion on any other thing. An author, there|fore, can &s;carcely commit a greater fault, than, in the mid&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion, to introduce a Simile. Metaphorical expre&s;&s;ion may be al|lowable in &s;uch a &s;ituation; though even this may be carried too far: but the pomp and &s;olemnity of a formal Compari&s;on is altoge|ther a &s;tranger to pa&s;&s;ion. It changes the key in a moment; relaxes and brings down the mind; and &s;hews us a writer perfectly at his ea&s;e, while he is per&s;onating &s;ome other, who is &s;uppo&s;ed to be under the torment of agi|tation. Our writers of tragedies are very apt to err here. In &s;ome of Mr. Rowe's plays, the&s;e flowers of &s;imiles have been &s;trewed un&s;ea&s;onably. Mr. Addi&s;on's Cato, too, is ju&s;tly cen&s;urable in this re&s;pect; as, when Portius, ju&s;t after Lucia had bid him farewel for ever, and when he &s;hould naturally have been repre&s;ented as in the mo&s;t violent an|gui&s;h, makes his reply in a &s;tudied and af|fected compari&s;on:<Q><L>Thus o'er the dying lamp th' un&s;teady flame</L>
<L>Hangs quiv'ring on a point, leaps off by fits,</L>
<L>And falls again, as loth to quit its hold.</L>
<L>Thou mu&s;t not go; my &s;oul &s;till hovers o'er thee,</L>
<L>And can't get loo&s;e.</L></Q> <PB N="411" REF="417">
Every one mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that this is quite remote from the language of Nature on &s;uch occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, as Compari&s;on is not the &s;tyle of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion, &s;o neither, when employed for embelli&s;hment, is it the language of a mind wholly unmoved. It is a figure of dig|nity, and always requires &s;ome elevation in the &s;ubject, in order to make it proper: for it &s;uppo&s;es the imagination to be uncom|monly enlivened, though the heart be not agitated by pa&s;&s;ion. In a word, the proper place of compari&s;ons lies in the middle re|gion between the highly pathetic, and the very humble &s;tyle. This is a wide field, and gives ample range to the Figure. But even this field we mu&s;t take care not to over&s;tock with it. For, as was before &s;aid, it is a &s;parkling ornament; and all things that &s;par|kle, dazzle and fatigue, if they recur too often. Similies &s;hould, even in poetry, be u&s;ed with moderation; but, in pro&s;e writ|ings, much more: otherwi&s;e, the &s;tyle will become di&s;gu&s;tingly lu&s;cious, and the orna|ment lo&s;e its virtue and effect.</P>
<P>I PROCEED, next, to the rules that relate to objects, whence Compari&s;ons &s;hould be drawn; &s;uppo&s;ing them introduced in their proper place.</P>
<P><PB N="412" REF="418">
IN the fir&s;t place, they mu&s;t not be drawn from things, which have too near and obvi|ous a re&s;emblance to the object with which we compare them. The great plea&s;ure of the act of comparing lies, in di&s;covering likene&s;&s;es among things of different &s;pecies, where we would not, at the fir&s;t glance, ex|pect a re&s;emblance. There is little art or in|genuity in pointing out the re&s;emblance of two objects, that are &s;o much a-kin, or lie &s;o near to one another in nature, that every one &s;ees they mu&s;t be like. When Milton compares Satan's appearance, after his fall, to that of the Sun &s;uffering an eclip&s;e, and affrighting the nations with portentous dark|ne&s;s, we are &s;truck with the happine&s;s and the dignity of the &s;imilitude. But, when he compares Eve's bower in Paradi&s;e, to the arbour of Pomona; or Eve her&s;elf, to a Dryad, or Wood-nymph, we receive little entertainment: as every one &s;ees, that one arbour mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, in &s;everal re&s;pects, re&s;emble another arbour, and one beautiful woman another beautiful woman.</P>
<P>AMONG Similies faulty through too great obviou&s;ne&s;s of the likene&s;s, we mu&s;t like|wi&s;e rank tho&s;e which are taken from objects become trite and familiar in poetical Lan|guage. Such are the Similies of a hero to a lion, of a per&s;on in &s;orrow to a flower droop|ing its head, of violent pa&s;&s;ion to a tempe&s;t, of cha&s;tity to &s;now, of virtue to the &s;un or
<PB N="413" REF="419">
the &s;tars, and many more of this kind, with which we are &s;ure to find modern writers, of &s;econd rate genius, abounding plentifully; handed down from every writer of ver&s;es to another, as by hereditary right. The&s;e com|pari&s;ons were, at fir&s;t, perhaps, very proper for the purpo&s;es to which they are applied. In the antient original poets, who took them directly from nature, not from their prede|ce&s;&s;ors, they had beauty. But they are now beaten; our ears are &s;o accu&s;tomed to them, that they give no amu&s;ement to the fancy. There is, indeed, no mark by which we can more readily di&s;tingui&s;h a poet of true geni|us, from one of a barren imagination, than by the &s;train of their compari&s;ons. All who call them&s;elves poets affect them: but, where|as a mere ver&s;ifier copies no new image from nature, which appears, to his uninventive genius, exhau&s;ted by tho&s;e who have gone before him, and, therefore, contents him&s;elf with humbly following their tract; to an author of real fancy, nature &s;eems to un|lock, &s;pontaneou&s;ly, her hidden &s;tores; and the eye <Q REND="inline">"quick glancing from earth to hea|ven,"</Q> di&s;covers new &s;hapes and forms, new likene&s;&s;es between objects unob&s;erved before, which render his Similies original, expre&s;&s;ive, and lively.</P>
<P>BUT, in the &s;econd place, as Compari&s;ons ought not to be founded on likene&s;&s;es too ob|vious, &s;till le&s;s ought they to be founded on
<PB N="414" REF="420">
tho&s;e which are too faint and remote. For the&s;e, in place of a&s;&s;i&s;ting, &s;train the fancy to comprehend them, and throw no light upon the &s;ubject. It is al&s;o to be ob&s;erved, that a Compari&s;on which, in the principal circum&s;tances, carries a &s;ufficiently near re|&s;emblance, may become unnatural and ob|&s;cure, if pu&s;hed too far. Nothing is more oppo&s;ite to the de&s;ign of this figure, than to hunt after a great number of coincidences in minute points, merely to &s;how how far the poet's wit can &s;tretch the re&s;emblance. This is Mr. Cowley's common fault; who&s;e com|pari&s;ons generally run out &s;o far, as to become rather a &s;tudied exerci&s;e of wit, than an illu&s;|tration of the principal object. We need only open his works, his odes e&s;pecially, to find in&s;tances every where.</P>
<P>IN the third place, the object from which a Compari&s;on is drawn, &s;hould never be an unknown object, or one of which few people can form clear ideas: <Q REND="inline">"Ad inferendam rebus lucem,"</Q> &s;ays Quinctilian, <Q REND="inline">"repertae &s;unt &s;imilitudines. Praecipu&egrave;, igitur, e&s;t cu&s;|todiendum ne id quod &s;imilitudinis grati&acirc; a&s;civimus, aut ob&s;curum &s;it, aut ignotum. Debet enim id quod illu&s;trandae alterius rei grati&acirc; a&s;&s;umitur, ip&s;um e&s;&s;e clarius eo quod illuminatur<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Compari&s;ons have been introduced into di&s;cour&s;e, for the &s;ake of throwing light on the &s;ubject. We mu&s;t there|fore, be much on our guard, not to employ, as the ground of our Simile, any object which is either ob&s;cure or unknown. That, &s;urely, which is u&s;ed for the purpo&s;e of illu&s;trating &s;ome other thing, ought to be more obvious and plain, than the thing intended to be illu&s;trated."</Q></NOTE>."</Q> Compari&s;ons, therefore,
<PB N="415" REF="421">
founded on philo&s;ophical di&s;coveries, or on any thing which per&s;ons of a certain trade only, or a certain profe&s;&s;ion, are conver&s;ant, at|tain not their proper effect. They &s;hould be taken from tho&s;e illu&s;trious, noted objects, which mo&s;t of the readers either have &s;een, or can &s;trongly conceive. This leads me to remark a fault of which modern poets are very apt to be guilty. The antients took their &s;imilies from that face of nature, and that cla&s;s of objects, with which they and their readers were acquainted. Hence lions, and wolves, and &s;erpents, were fruitful, and very proper &s;ources of Similies among&s;t them; and the&s;e having become a &s;ort of con&s;ecrat|ed, cla&s;&s;ical images, are very commonly adopt|ed by the moderns; injudiciou&s;ly however, for the propriety of them is now in a great mea&s;ure lo&s;t. It is only at &s;econd hand, and by de&s;cription, that we are acquainted with many of tho&s;e objects; and, to mo&s;t readers of poetry, it were more to the purpo&s;e, to de&s;cribe lions, or &s;erpents, by Similies taken from men, than to de&s;cribe men by lions. Now-a-days, we can much ea&s;ier form the conception of a fierce combat between two men, than between a bull and a tyger. Eve|ry country has a &s;cenery peculiar to it&s;elf; and the imagery of every good poet will ex|hibit
<PB N="416" REF="422">
it. The introduction of unknown ob|jects, or of a foreign &s;cenery, betrays a poet copying, not after nature, but from other writers. I have only to ob&s;erve further,</P>
<P>IN the fourth place, that, in compo&s;itions of a &s;erious or elevated kind, Similies &s;hould never be taken from low or mean objects. The&s;e are degrading; whereas, Similies are commonly intended to embelli&s;h, and to dig|nify: and, therefore, unle&s;s in burle&s;que writ|ings, or where Similies are introduced pur|po&s;ely to vilify and dimini&s;h an object, mean ideas &s;hould never be pre&s;ented to us. Some of Homer's Compari&s;ons have been taxed without rea&s;on, on this account. For it is to be remembered, that the meanne&s;s or dignity of objects, depends, in a great degree, on the ideas and manners of the age wherein we live. Many Similies, therefore, drawn from the in|cidents of rural life, which appear low to us, had abundance of dignity in tho&s;e &s;impler ages of antiquity.</P>
<P>I HAVE now con&s;idered &s;uch of the figures of Speech as &s;eemed mo&s;t to merit a full and particular di&s;cu&s;&s;ion: Metaphor, Hyperbole, Per&s;onification, Apo&s;trophe, and Compari&s;on. A few more yet remain to be mentioned; the proper u&s;e and conduct of which will be ea&s;ily under&s;tood from the principles already laid down.</P>
<P><PB N="417" REF="423">
AS Compari&s;on is founded on the re&s;em|blance, &s;o Antithe&s;is on the contra&s;t or oppo|&s;ition of two objects. Contra&s;t has always this effect, to make each of the contra&s;ted ob|jects appear in the &s;tronger light. White, for in&s;tance, never appears &s;o bright as when it is oppo&s;ed to black; and when both are viewed together. Antithe&s;is, therefore, may, on many occa&s;ions, be employed to advan|tage, in order to &s;trengthen the impre&s;&s;ion which we intend that any object &s;hould make. Thus Cicero, in his oration for Milo, repre&s;enting the improbability of Milo's form|ing a de&s;ign to take away the life of Clodius, at a time when all circum&s;tances were unfa|vourable to &s;uch a de&s;ign, and after he had let other opp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">unities &s;lip when he could have executed the &s;ame de&s;ign, if he had formed it, with much more ea&s;e and &s;afety, heightens our conviction of this improbability by a &s;kilful u&s;e of this figure: <Q REND="inline">"Quem igitur cum omnium grati&acirc; interficere noluit, hunc voluit cum aliquorum querel&acirc;? Quem jure, quem loco, quem tempore, quem impune, non e&s;t au&s;us, hunc injuri&acirc;, iniquo loco, alieno tempore, periculo capitis, non dubi|tavit occidere<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Is it credible that, when he declined putting Clodius to death with the con&s;ent of all, he would chu&s;e to do it with the di&s;approbation of many? Can you believe that the per|&s;on whom he &s;crupled to &s;lay, when he might have done &s;o with full ju&s;tice, in a convenient place, at a proper time, with &s;ecure impunity, he made no &s;cruple to murder again&s;t ju&s;tice, in an unfavourable place, at an un&s;ea&s;onable time, and at the ri&s;que of capital condemnation?"</Q></NOTE>?"</Q> In order to render an
<PB N="418" REF="424">
Antithe&s;is more complete, it is always of ad|vantage, that the words and members of the &s;entence, expre&s;&s;ing the contra&s;ted objects, be, as in this in&s;tance of Cicero's, &s;imilarly con|&s;tructed, and made to corre&s;pond to each other. This leads us to remark the contra&s;t more, by &s;etting the things which we oppo&s;e more clearly over again&s;t each other; in the &s;ame manner as when we contra&s;t a black and a white object, in order to perceive the full difference of their colour, we would chu&s;e to have both objects of the &s;ame bulk, and placed in the &s;ame light. Their re&s;emblance to each other, in certain circum&s;tances, makes their di&s;agreement in others more palpable.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the frequent u&s;e of Antithe&s;is, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">pecially where the oppo&s;ition in the words is nice and quaint, is apt to render &s;tyle di&s;agreeable. Such a &s;entence as the following, from Seneca, does very well, where it &s;tands alone: <Q REND="inline">"Si quem volueris e&s;&s;e divitem, non e&s;t quod augeas divitias, &s;ed minuas cupiditates<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"If you &s;eek to make one rich, &s;tudy not to increa&s;e his &s;tores, but to dimini&s;h his de&s;ires."</Q></NOTE>."</Q> Or this: <Q REND="inline">"Si ad naturam vives, nunquam eris pauper; &s;i ad opinionem, nunquam dives<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"If you regulate your de&s;ires according to the &s;tandard of nature, you will never be poor; if according to the &s;tandard of opinion, you will never be rich."</Q></NOTE>."</Q> A max|im, or moral &s;aying, properly enough receives this form; both becau&s;e it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the fruit of meditation, and becau&s;e it is de|&s;igned to be engraven on the memory, which recalls it more ea&s;ily by the help of &s;uch con|tra&s;ted
<PB N="419" REF="425">
expre&s;&s;ions. But where a &s;tring of &s;uch &s;entences &s;ucceed each other; where this be|comes an author's favourite and prevailing manner of expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf, his &s;tyle is faul|ty; and it is upon this account Seneca has been often, and ju&s;tly, cen&s;ured. Such a &s;tyle appears too &s;tudied and laboured; it gives us the impre&s;&s;ion of an author attending more to his manner of &s;aying things, than to the things them&s;elves which he &s;ays. Dr. Young, though a writer of real genius, was too fond of Antithe&s;es. In his E&s;timate of Human Life, we find whole pages that run in &s;uch a &s;train as this: <Q REND="inline">"The pea&s;ant complains aloud; the courtier in &s;ecret repines. In want, what di&s;tre&s;s? in affluence, what &s;atiety? The great are under as much difficulty to expend with plea&s;ure, as the mean to labour with &s;ucce&s;s. The ignorant, through ill|grounded hope, are di&s;appointed; the knowing, through knowledge, de&s;pond. Ig|norance, occa&s;ions mi&s;take; mi&s;take, di&s;ap|pointment; and di&s;appointment is mi&s;ery. Knowledge, on the other hand, gives true judgment; and true judgment of human things, gives a demon&s;tration of their in&s;uf|ficiency to our peace."</Q> There is too much glitter in &s;uch a &s;tyle as this to plea&s;e long. We are fatigued, by attending to &s;uch quaint and artificial &s;entences often repeated.</P>
<P>THERE is another &s;ort of Antithe&s;is, the beauty of which con&s;i&s;ts, in &s;urpri&s;ing us by
<PB N="420" REF="426">
the unexpected contra&s;ts of things which it brings together. Much wit may be &s;hewn in this; but it belongs wholly to pieces of profe&s;&s;ed wit and humour, and can find no place in grave compo&s;itions. Mr. Pope, who is remarkably fond of Antithe&s;is, is often happy in this u&s;e of the figure. So, in his Rape of the Lock:<Q><L>Whether the nymph &s;hall break Diana's law,</L>
<L>Or &s;ome frail china jar receive a flaw;</L>
<L>Or &s;tain her honour, or her new brocade;</L>
<L>Forget her prayers, or mi&s;s a ma&s;querade;</L>
<L>Or lo&s;e her heart, or necklace, at a ball,</L>
<L>Or whether heaven has doomed that Shock mu&s;t fall.</L></Q> What is called the point of an epigram, con|&s;i&s;ts, for mo&s;t part, in &s;ome Antithe&s;is of this kind; &s;urpri&s;ing us with the &s;mart and un|expected turn, which it gives to the thought; and in the fewer words it is brought out, it is always the happier.</P>
<P>COMPARISONS and Antithe&s;es are figures of a cool nature; the productions of imagi|nation, not of pa&s;&s;ion. Interrogations and Exclamations, of which I am next to &s;peak, are pa&s;&s;ionate figures. They are, indeed, on &s;o many occa&s;ions, the native language of pa&s;&s;ion, that their u&s;e is extremely frequent; and, in ordinary conver&s;ation, when men are heated, they prevail as much as in the mo&s;t &s;ublime oratory. The unfigured, lite|ral
<PB N="421" REF="427">
u&s;e of Interrogation, is, to a&s;k a que&s;tion; but when men are prompted by pa&s;&s;ion, whatever they would affirm, or deny, with great vehemence, they naturally put in the form of a que&s;tion; expre&s;&s;ing thereby the &s;tronge&s;t confidence of the truth of their own &s;entiment, and appealing to their hear|ers for the impo&s;&s;ibility of the contrary. Thus, in Scripture: <Q REND="inline">"God is not a man that he &s;hould lie, neither the &s;on of man that he &s;hould repent. Hath he &s;aid it? And &s;hall he not do it? Hath he &s;poken it? and &s;hall he not make it good<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numbers, chap. xxiii. ver. 19.</NOTE>?"</Q> So Demo&s;t|henes, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Athenians: <Q REND="inline">"Tell me, will you &s;till go about and a&s;k one another, what news? What can be more a&s;toni&s;hing news than this, that the man of Macedon makes war upon the Athenians, and di&s;po&s;es of the affairs of Greece?&mdash;Is Philip dead? No, but he is &s;ick. What &s;ignifies it to you whether he be dead or alive? For, if any thing hap|pens to this Philip, you will immediately rai&s;e up another."</Q> All this delivered with|out interrogation, had been faint and ineffec|tual; but the warmth and eagerne&s;s which this que&s;tioning method expre&s;&s;es, awakens the hearers, and &s;trikes them with much greater force.</P>
<P><PB N="422" REF="428">
INTERROGATIONS may often be employ|ed with propriety, in the cour&s;e of no higher emotions than naturally ari&s;e in pur&s;uing &s;ome clo&s;e and earne&s;t rea&s;oning. But Ex|clamations belong only to &s;tronger emotions of the mind; to &s;urpri&s;e, admiration, anger, joy, grief, and the like:
<Q><L>Heu pietas! heu pri&s;ca fides! invictaque bello</L>
<L>Dextera!</L></Q>
Both Interrogation and Exclamation, and, indeed, all pa&s;&s;ionate figures of &s;peech, ope|rate upon us by means of &s;ympathy. Sym|pathy is a very powerful and exten&s;ive prin|ciple in our nature, di&s;po&s;ing us to enter in|to every feeling and pa&s;&s;ion, which we be|hold expre&s;&s;ed by others. Hence, a &s;ingle per&s;on coming into company with &s;trong marks, either of melancholy or joy, upon his countenance, will diffu&s;e that pa&s;&s;ion, in a moment, through the whole circle. Hence, in a great crowd, pa&s;&s;ions are &s;o ea&s;ily caught, and &s;o fa&s;t &s;pread, by that powerful conta|gion which the animated looks, cries, and ge&s;tures of a multitude never fail to carry. Now, Interrogations and Exclamations, be|ing natural &s;igns of a moved and agitated mind, always, when they are properly u&s;ed, di&s;po&s;e us to &s;ympathi&s;e with the di&s;po&s;itions of tho&s;e who u&s;e them, and to feel as they feel.</P>
<P><PB N="423" REF="429">
FROM this it follows, that the great rule with regard to the conduct of &s;uch figures is, that the writer attend to the manner in which nature dictates to us to expre&s;s any emotion or pa&s;&s;ion, and that he give his lan|guage that turn, and no other; above all, that he never affect the &s;tyle of a pa&s;&s;ion which he does not feel. With Interrogations he may u&s;e a good deal of freedom; the&s;e, as above ob&s;erved, falling in &s;o much with the ordinary cour&s;e of language and rea&s;on|ing, even when no great vehemence is &s;up|po&s;ed to have place in the mind. But, with re&s;pect to Exclamations, he mu&s;t be more re&s;erved. Nothing has a wor&s;e effect than the frequent and un&s;ea&s;onable u&s;e of them. Raw, juvenile writers imagine, that, by pouring them forth often, they render their compo&s;itions warm and animated. Whereas quite the contrary follows. They render it frigid to exce&s;s. When an author is always calling upon us to enter into tran&s;ports which he has &s;aid nothing to in&s;pire, we are both di&s;gu&s;ted and enraged at him. He rai&s;es no &s;ympathy, for he gives us no pa&s;&s;ion of his own, in which we can take part. He gives us words, and not pa&s;&s;ion; and of cour&s;e, can rai&s;e no pa&s;&s;ion, unle&s;s that of indigna|tion. Hence, I incline to think, he was not much mi&s;taken, who &s;aid, that when, on looking into a book, he found the pages thick be&s;pangled with the point which is call|ed, <Q REND="inline">"Punctum admirationis,"</Q> he judged this
<PB N="424" REF="430">
to be a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for his laying it a&s;ide. And, indeed, were it not for the help of this <Q REND="inline">"punctum admirationis,"</Q> with which many writers of the rapturous kind &s;o much abound, one would be often at a lo&s;s to di&s;cover, whe|ther or not it was Exclamation which they aimed at. For, it has now become a fa&s;hion, among the&s;e writers, to &s;ubjoin points of ad|miration to &s;entences, which contain nothing but &s;imple affirmations, or propo&s;itions; as if, by an affected method of pointing, they could transform them in the reader's mind into high figures of eloquence. Much a-kin to this, is another contrivance practi&s;ed by &s;ome writers, of &s;eparating, almo&s;t all the members of their &s;entences from each other, by blank lines; as if, by &s;etting them thus a&s;under, they be&s;towed &s;ome &s;pecial import|ance upon them; and required us, in going along, to make a pau&s;e at every other word, and weigh it well. This, I think, may be called a Typographical Figure of Speech. Neither, indeed, &s;ince we have been led to mention the arts of writers for increa&s;ing the importance of their words, does another cu&s;tom, which prevailed very much &s;ome time ago, &s;eem worthy of imitation; I mean that of di&s;tingui&s;hing the &s;ignificant words, in every &s;entence, by Italick characters. On &s;ome occa&s;ions, it is very proper to u&s;e &s;uch di&s;tinctions. But when we carry them &s;o far, as to mark with them every &s;uppo&s;ed em|phatical word, the&s;e words are apt to mul|tiply
<PB N="425" REF="431">
&s;o fa&s;t in the author's imagination, that every page is crowded with Italicks; which can produce no effect whatever, but to hurt the eye, and create confu&s;ion. Indeed, if the &s;en&s;e point out the mo&s;t emphatical ex|pre&s;&s;ions, a variation in the type, e&s;pecially when occurring &s;o frequently, will give &s;mall aid. And, accordingly, the mo&s;t ma&s;terly writers, of late, have, with good rea&s;on, laid a&s;ide all tho&s;e feeble props of &s;ignificancy, and tru&s;ted wholly to the weight of their &s;entiments for commanding attention. But to return from this digre&s;&s;ion:</P>
<P>ANOTHER Figure of Speech, proper only to animated and warm Compo&s;ition, is what &s;ome critical writers call Vi&s;ion; when, in place of relating &s;omething that is pa&s;t, we u&s;e the pre&s;ent ten&s;e, and de&s;cribe it as actu|ally pa&s;&s;ing before our eyes. Thus Cicero, in his fourth oration again&s;t Catiline: <Q REND="inline">"Vi|deor enim mihi hanc urbem videre, lucem orbis terrarum atque arcem omnium gen|tium, &s;ubito uno incendio concidentem; cerno animo &s;epulta in patria mi&s;eros at|que in&s;epultos acervos civium; ver&s;atur mihi ante oculos a&s;pectus Cethegi, et furor, in ve&s;tra caede bacchantis<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"I &s;eem to my&s;elf to behold this city, the ornament of the earth, and the capital of all nations, &s;uddenly involved on one conflagration. I &s;ee before me the &s;laughtered heaps of citizens lying unburied in the mid&s;t of their ruined coun|try. The furious countenance of Cethegus ri&s;es to my view, while with a &s;avage joy he is triumphing in your mi|&s;eries."</Q></NOTE>."</Q> This man|ner
<PB N="426" REF="432">
of de&s;cription &s;uppo&s;es a &s;ort of enthu|&s;ia&s;m, which carries the per&s;on who de&s;cribes in &s;ome mea&s;ure out of him&s;elf; and, when well executed, mu&s;t needs impre&s;s the reader or hearer &s;trongly, by the force of that &s;ym|pathy which I have before explained. But, in order to a &s;ucce&s;sful execution, it requires an uncommonly warm imagination, and &s;uch a happy &s;election of circum&s;tances, as &s;hall make us think we &s;ee before our eyes the &s;cene that is de&s;cribed. Otherwi&s;e, it &s;hares the &s;ame fate with all feeble attempts towards pa&s;&s;ionate figures; that of throwing ridicule upon the author, and leaving the reader more cool and unintere&s;ted than he was before. The &s;ame ob&s;ervations are to be applied to Repetition, Su&s;pen&s;ion, Correction, and ma|ny more of tho&s;e figurative forms of Speech, which rhetoricians have enumerated among the Beauties of Eloquence. They are beau|tiful, or not, exactly in proportion as they are native expre&s;&s;ions of the &s;entiment or pa&s;&s;ion intended to be heightened by them. Let nature and pa&s;&s;ion always &s;peak their own language, and they will &s;ugge&s;t figures in abundance. But when we &s;eek to coun|terfeit a warmth which we do not feel, no figures will either &s;upply the defect, or con|ceal the impo&s;ture.</P>
<P><PB N="427" REF="433">
THERE is one Figure (and I &s;hall mention no more) of frequent u&s;e among all public &s;peakers, particularly at the bar, which Quinc|tilian in&s;i&s;ts upon con&s;iderably, and calls Am|plification. It con&s;i&s;ts in an artful exagge|ration of all the circum&s;tances of &s;ome ob|ject or action which we want to place in a &s;trong light, either a good or a bad one. It is not &s;o properly one Figure, as the &s;kilful management of &s;everal which we make to tend to one point. It may be carried on by a proper u&s;e of magnifying or extenuating terms, by a regular enumeration of particu|lars, or by throwing together, as into one ma&s;s, a crowd of circum&s;tances; by &s;ugge&s;t|ing compari&s;ons al&s;o with things of a like na|ture. But the principal in&s;trument by which it works, is by a Climax, or a gradual ri&s;e of one circum&s;tance above another, till our idea be rai&s;ed to the utmo&s;t. I &s;poke formerly of a Climax in &s;ound; a Climax in &s;en&s;e, when well carried on, is a figure which never fails to amplify &s;trongly. The common example of this, is that noted pa&s;&s;age in Cicero which every &s;choolboy knows: <Q REND="inline">"Facinus e&s;t vincire civem Romanum; &s;celus verberare, prope parricidium, necare; quid dicam in cru|cem tollere<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"It is a crime to put a Roman citizen in bonds: it is the height of guilt to &s;courge him; little le&s;s than parricide to put him to death. What name then &s;hall I give to cruci|fying him?"</Q></NOTE>?"</Q> I &s;hall give an in&s;tance from a printed pleading of a famous Scotch
<PB N="428" REF="434">
Lawyer, Sir George M'Kenzie. It is in a charge to the jury, in the ca&s;e of a woman accu&s;ed of murdering her own child. <Q REND="inline">"Gen|tlemen, if one man had any how &s;lain an|other, if an adver&s;ary had killed his op|po&s;er, or a woman occa&s;ioned the death of her enemy, even the&s;e criminals would have been capitally puni&s;hed by the Cor|nelian law: but, if this guiltle&s;s infant, who could make no enemy, had been mur|dered by its own nur&s;e, What puni&s;hments would not then the mother have demand|ed? With what cries and exclamations would &s;he have &s;tunned your ears? What &s;hall we &s;ay then, when a woman, guilty of homicide, a mother, of the murder of her innocent child, hath compri&s;ed all tho&s;e mi&s;deeds in one &s;ingle crime; a crime, in its own nature, dete&s;table; in a woman, prodigious; in a mother, incredible; and perpetrated again&s;t one who&s;e age called for compa&s;&s;ion, who&s;e near relation claim|ed affection, and who&s;e innocence de&s;erv|ed the highe&s;t favour?"</Q> I mu&s;t take notice, however, that &s;uch regular Climaxes as the&s;e, though they have con&s;iderable beauty, have, at the &s;ame time, no &s;mall appearance of art and &s;tudy; and, therefore, though they may be admitted into formal harangues, yet they &s;peak not the language of great earne&s;tne&s;s and pa&s;&s;ion, which &s;eldom proceed by &s;teps &s;o regular.

&s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, as an arrangement of circum|&s;tances in a le&s;s artificial order.
