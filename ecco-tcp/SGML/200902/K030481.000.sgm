<HEAD>Adverti&s;ement.</HEAD>
<P>THE precept, which directs a poet to keep his piece nine years, has been fully ob&s;erved in regard to the following <HI>Tragedy;</HI> but the <HI>Author</HI> will not claim the merit of voluntary &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to critical authority. The delay, he acknowledges, did not ari&s;e from choice, but was rather the con&s;equence of difficulties that &s;tood in his way, and prevented an earlier acce&s;s to the public.</P>
<P>The Play was written in the year 1762, and the Briti&s;h forces were then actually doing at the HAVAN NAH, what ALZUMA prays for in the third act. The &s;ubject appeared of the fir&s;t importance to the intere&s;ts of humanity. In peru&s;ing the hi&s;tory of the Spani&s;h conque&s;ts in AMBRICA, the AUTHOR found among un|enlightened &s;avages &s;uch in&s;tances of genero&s;ity, truth, ju&s;tice, courage, and even clemency, as would have done honour to tho&s;e, who profe&s;s'd in that part of the world to &s;pread the light of truth and civilization. The behaviour of ATA-HUALPA (called by Engli&s;h writers ATABALIPA) the la&s;t INCA of PERU, in his intercour&s;e with FRYAR VINCENTI, appeared particular|ly &s;triking. He heard the SPANISH MISSIONER with calm attention, and replied, <HI>that it was ab&s;urd on the part of the</HI> POPE <HI>to grant away a territory which did not belong to him; he would &s;till continue to venerate the gods of his ance&s;tors; and if the chri&s;tians wor&s;hipped a god that died, he adored the &s;un that never died.</HI> He viewed the the prayer-book, which the fryar put into his hands, and after &s;aying that it conveyed to him no information, threw it down with a &s;mile. By this hone&s;t &s;implicity, which would have gained the affections of a generous mind, FATHER VINCENTI was &s;o enraged, that he gave the word of command, crying out, <HI>"Kill the dogs, who trample under foot the word of God."</HI> An incident like this could not fail to excite indignation; and that in|dignation ro&s;e &s;till higher, when it appeared that arti|cles
<PB REF="3">of high trea&s;on were in form exhibited again&s;t ATA|HUALPA, and, after that execrable farce of &s;tate, the prince of a world ju&s;t di&s;covered &s;uffered as a rebel to the Emperor Charles V.&mdash;When GUATIMOZIN, one of the leading chiefs, lies &s;tretched upon the rack, and, hearing the groans of his fellow &s;ufferer, a&s;ks him, in perfect tranquillity, <HI>Am I upon a bed of ro&s;es?</HI> the heart, that does not melt with tenderne&s;s for the Ame|rican, mu&s;t be as hard as FRYAR VINCENTI'S. Not to multiply in&s;tances, the &s;tory of a people ma&s;&s;acred becau&s;e they abounded in gold-mines, and had not heard the important truths of the chri&s;tian religion, &s;eemed of all others the fitte&s;t for the Engli&s;h &s;tage, as it tended in a &s;trong degree to that pathetic di&s;tre&s;s, and that vigour of &s;entiment, which con&s;titute the e&s;&s;ential beauty of tragedy.</P>
<P>The author regretted that &s;uch a genius as DRYDEN had not left a play, free from the jingle of rhyme, and of a more legitimate kind, that the pre&s;ent attempt might have been excluded. He regretted al&s;o, that, from DRYDEN's time, the poets of this nation &s;eem to have abandoned the poor Americans to their fate. He knew that FRANCE was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a beautiful play upon the &s;ubject: but the ta&s;te of LONDON and PARIS being very different, the late Mr. AARON HILL's tran&s;lation of that piece, appeared upon the Engli&s;h &s;tage and va|ni&s;hed.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent writer was of opinion that &s;o intere&s;ting a &s;ubject ought not to be neglected. His fir&s;t de&s;ign was to new mould the ALZIRE of VOLTAIRE, not in a vain pre&s;umption that he could excel a writer &s;o ju&s;tly famous throughout Europe, but with an idea that he could in &s;ome in&s;tances adapt the &s;cenes to the reli&s;h of an Engli&s;h audience. That plan, however, was &s;oon de&s;ert|ed: it occurred, that if this author followed the &s;teps of MONSIEUR DE VOLTAIRE, the words, FRENCH TRANSLATOR, UNBLUSHING PLAGIARY, would fill the columns of every news-paper. To civilities of this
<PB REF="4">kind the author has been u&s;ed. If the per&s;ons who have been &s;o liberal feel them&s;elves di&s;po&s;ed to lavi&s;h their favours on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, they will perhaps be glad of a hint, that may &s;upply ample materials. If they will look into the plays of SOPHOCLES and EURIPIDES, they will perceive in what &s;chool the writer of ALZUMA has &s;tudied the art of con&s;tructing a fable.</P>
<Q><L><HI>A&s;pice ut exuvias veterumque in&s;ignia nobis</HI></L>
<L><HI>Aptemus.&mdash;</HI></L>
<BIBL>VIDA POETIC.</BIBL></Q>
<P>There was another rea&s;on for not adhering to the plan of VOLTAIRE: In a country like this, it was thought that our &s;cene ought not to be indebted to a foreign writer for a play, which involves the fir&s;t great point of human liberty, namely, the right of man to think for him&s;elf. In this opinion ALZUMA was writ|ten, and (except a few minute corrections in the cour&s;e of the rehear&s;als) was, in its pre&s;ent form, ready for the &s;tage above ten years ago.</P>
<P>There were, indeed, at that time certain rea&s;ons, which made the author unwilling to precipitate him|&s;elf into a dealing with managers. Tho&s;e rea&s;ons &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted till Nov. 1767, when this tragedy was put into the hands of Mr. GARRICK. It was copied out by the prompter of Drury-Lane theatre, but remained in &s;u&s;pence till Sept. 1770, when the Author found it upon his table, without a letter, or even a card. The play, it is true, was not pronounced unworthy of repre&s;entation, but certainly was treated as a piece that did not de&s;erve the lea&s;t di&s;patch. Delay was &s;tudied, and the rea&s;ons for that delay exi&s;ted no where but in Mr. GARRICK's imagination. A certain political &s;ociety, he was &s;ure, would damn any production known to come from the pen of the pre&s;ent writer. Time, however, has &s;hewn that he had not given umbrage to any &s;et of men whatever. In political controver&s;y he had not meddled for a number of years, and he takes this opportunity to declare, that in his
<PB REF="5">whole life he never was the author of one clande&s;tine line. Whatever he writ, he had the &s;pirit and honour to avow it. Mr. GARRICK was told this, but without effect: the play was thrown back upon the author's hands, he &s;ubmitted to it, and would have con|&s;igned all the circum&s;tances of that tran&s;action to oblivion, if the &s;ame policy had not been practi&s;ed upon him, in another inftance, this very winter.</P>
<P>That ALZUMA has at length appeared, is owing to the friend&s;hip of Mr. HARRIS. He de&s;ired to draw forth the piece from the author's clo&s;et: Mr. COLMAN accepted it with great frankne&s;s; and from that in&s;tant went right forward without delay, without duplicity, without equivocation. The author takes this oppor|tunity to thank all the proprietors of Covent Garden Theatre for the fairne&s;s of their dealings: His thanks are al&s;o due to the performers for their a&s;&s;iduity in preparing the play for repre&s;entation. The re&s;t is before the public: Mr. BENSLEY and Mr. HULL did ju&s;tice to their re&s;pective characters: Mr. SMITH's exertion of di&s;tingui&s;hed merit is well known. Mi&s;s MILLER &s;truggled even in illne&s;s for the public favour, and Mrs. HARTLEYS' beauty and elegant per|formance adorned every &s;cene, in which &s;he appeared.</P>
<P>The Author cannot conclude without declaring, that (exclu&s;ive of his late tran&s;action with Mr. COL|MAN) he has every rea&s;on to be di&s;gu&s;ted at the inter|nal occurrences of a theatre. It is, therefore, pro|bable that he &s;hall never again be a candidate for Theatical Fame: From the farce of the APPRENTICE to the tragedy of ALZUMA his endeavours have at all times met with a mo&s;t generous reception from the Town: He feels the obligation with the warme&s;t &s;en&s;ibility, and remains with due re&s;pect to the PUBLIC,</P>
