<HEAD>THE ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the great names, which have done honor to antiquity in general, and to the Roman Republic in particular, that of <HI>Marcus Attilius Regulus</HI> has, by the general con&s;ent of all ages, been con&s;idered as one of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable, &s;ince he not only &s;acrificed his labours, his liberty, and his life for the good of his country; But by a greatne&s;s of &s;oul, almo&s;t peculiar to him&s;elf, contrived to make his very misfortunes contribute to that glorious end.</P>
<P>After the Romans had met with various &s;ucce&s;&s;es in the fir&s;t Punic War, under the command of Regulus, victory at length declared for the oppo&s;ite party, the Roman Army was totally overthrown, and Regulus him&s;elf taken pri&s;oner, by <HI>Xantip|pus,</HI> a Lacedoemonian General in the &s;ervice of the Cartha|ginians: the victorious enemy, exulting in &s;o important a conque&s;t, kept him many years in clo&s;e impri&s;onment, and loaded him with the mo&s;t cruel Indignities. They thought it was new in their power to make their own terms with Rome, and determined to &s;end Regulus thither, with their Amba&s;&s;ador, to negotiate a peace, or at lea&s;t, an exchange of captives, thinking be would gladly per&s;uade his coun|trymen to di&s;continue a war, which nece&s;&s;arily prolonged his captivity. They previou&s;ly exacted from him an oath to return &s;hould his emba&s;&s;y prove un&s;ucce&s;sful; at the &s;ame time giving him to under&s;tand, that he mu&s;t expect to &s;uffer a cruel death if he failed in it; this they artfully intimated, as the &s;tronge&s;t motive for him to leave no means unattempt|ed to accompli&s;h their purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>At the unexpected arrival of this venerable hero, the Ro|mans expre&s;s'd the wilde&s;t tran&s;ports of joy, and would have &s;ubmitted to almo&s;t any conditions to procure his en|largement;
<PB REF="4" MS="y">
but, Regulus &s;o far from availing him&s;elf of his influence with the Senate to obtain any per&s;onal advan|tages, employed it to induce them to reject propo&s;als &s;o evi|dently tending to di&s;honour their country, declaring his fixed re&s;olution to return to bondage, and death, rather than violate his cath.</P>
<P>He at La&s;t extorted from them their con&s;ent; and depart|ed amid&s;t the tears of his family, the importunities of his friends, the applau&s;es of the Senate, and the tumultuous oppo&s;ition of the people; and as a great poet of his own na|tion beautifully ob&s;erves, <Q>he embarked for Carthage as calm and unconcerned, as if, on fini&s;hing the tedious law-&s;uits of his clients, he was retiring to Vena<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rian fields, or the &s;weet country of <HI>Tarentum.</HI></Q><NOTE PLACE="foot">HOR. Book III. Ode 5.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the above, and many other important parti|culars, the Author has paid the &s;tricte&s;t regard to hi&s;torical truth: In &s;ome le&s;s e&s;&s;ential points, where &s;he thought it would rather ob&s;truct than advance her purpo&s;e, &s;he has ventured to deviate from it; parti|cularly, in fixing the return of Regulus to Rome, po&s;terior to the death of his wife Martia. In <HI>this,</HI> and in the <HI>general</HI> conduct of the &s;tory, &s;he has followed the Italian poet Meta&s;ta&s;io in his Opera of <HI>three</HI> acts: of which &s;he has given a free tran&s;lation, and made &s;uch <HI>additions,</HI> as were nece&s;&s;ary to form it into a tragedy of <HI>five</HI> acts.</P>
