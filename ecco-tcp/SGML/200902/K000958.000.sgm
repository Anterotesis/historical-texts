<SPEAKER>Hearty.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Good Day to my dear Friend, what News have you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wildi&s;h.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been with the General to reconnoitre the Enemy, they have not di&s;turb'd our Foragers, but lie within their own Camp very quiet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Heart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure if the Marqui&s;s <HI>De Bay</HI> had a true Intel|ligence of the Weakne&s;s of our Intrenchments, and the Mortality of our Men, he would have attack'd us before now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>In all the Campaigns I have &s;erved on the&s;e Frontiers, I never knew it &s;o &s;ickly; the General con|tinues very much out of Order at <HI>E&s;tremoz,</HI> they think both the Major Generals will die, and my Brigadier was carried to <HI>Elvas</HI> la&s;t Night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Heart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then at pre&s;ent Brigadier General <HI>Conque&s;t</HI> commands our Forces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mo&s;t certainly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Heart.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Death of half a Dozen of the&s;e great Men, would make a fine Alteration in our Titles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will a&s;&s;ure you, Brigadier General <HI>Conque&s;t</HI> could ob&s;erve you were not at his Levee this Morn|ing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Heart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why? I was upon the Piquet where you know, Drinking hard is the main Part of the Duty&mdash;be&s;ides, I never appear at the General's but upon Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, for I can't &s;latter, and have a Stiffne&s;s between my Shoulders, that makes me incapable of Bowing low;
<PB N="2" REF="4">the Noi&s;e of the Peace gives me no pro&s;pect of ri&s;ing, being pretty well a&s;&s;ured the younge&s;t Captain of an old Regiment, mu&s;t wait for another War to get a bet|ter Title.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why? I was once of the Gang of tho&s;e &s;illy Fellows, who&s;e Ambition climb'd no higher than a Company in an old Regiment, which gave me a very di&s;tant Pro&s;pect of being provided for in Peace, when 'twas fifty to one I was knock'd on the Head before the War was over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Heart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Human Nature has always imprinted in us a De&s;ire for Something above us, &s;o gives us a Rotation of Unea&s;ine&s;s; and &s;carce in an Age do we meet with a Man that &s;its down plea&s;ed with his Condition, but we all lay Schemes, and make the pre&s;ent Time a Plague to us, in &s;eeking after the next Plague, which is &s;till to make us but the more mi&s;erable</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Fever, or the Bullet converts us to Du&s;t and A&s;hes, and our next Heirs are left at Liberty to play the Fool after the &s;ame Manner; but hang the&s;e di&s;mal Reflections.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Heart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is there no Courier from <HI>Lisbon,</HI> or News of a Packet from <HI>England.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>We hourly expect one&mdash;&s;ince our Forces have been ill, the <HI>Portugueze</HI> avoid us, and what is &s;trange, none of their Men have the Di&s;temper among&s;t them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Heart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Their Beads, the Prie&s;t's Ble&s;&s;ing, and their Garlick are &s;trong Pre&s;ervatives of Health&mdash;But &s;ee, either my Sight fails me, or that Officer coming this Way, is my dear Major <HI>Buck.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>And with him a clever Parcel of Recruits.</P>

<P>I left all our Friends well at <HI>London,</HI> paid my Taylor's Bill, which was due la&s;t Voyage, ad|ju&s;ted my Accounts with our Rogue of an Agent, gave Security to St. <HI>Martin</HI>'s Pari&s;h for my Wa&s;herwoman's Ba&s;tard, mounted my Po&s;t-Hor&s;e at Noon-Day, reach'd <HI>Falmouth</HI> the Moment the <HI>Mercury,</HI> hone&s;t Captain <HI>Green,</HI> was failing, which had on Board my &s;trapping Recruits, reached <HI>Lisbon</HI> in five Days; and after a fa|tiguing March of ten more, am this moment arrived to my great Satisfaction, having met with my two be&s;t Friends.</P>

The Wo|men of the Town take their Places in the Pit, with their wonted A&s;&s;urance.
