<HEAD>REPTILES.</HEAD>
<P>WE are now to con&s;ider the cla&s;s of reptiles, which are, for the mo&s;t part, objects of de|te&s;tation; but however the opinion of the world may be, if a writer undertakes a general hi&s;tory of animals, he mu&s;t include them: they form at le&s;t one link in the chain of beings, and may therefore be viewed with a degree of plea&s;ure by a philo&s;o|phic eye.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the prejudice again&s;t this cla&s;s is almo&s;t univer&s;al, is it founded on rea&s;on? In &s;ome it may be owned that the outward form is di&s;agreeable, while the noxious qualities of others are ju&s;tly productive of terror: but are we on that account to reject them? The more fatal they are, the more deeply we &s;hould enquire into their effects, that we may be capable of relieving tho&s;e who are &s;ufferers, and &s;ecure others from the &s;ame misfor|tune. But if we duly weigh their noxious qualities, we &s;hall, with our moral poet, find
<Q><HI>All partial evil univer&s;al good.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The teeth of wild bea&s;ts, and of &s;erpents, are not only created as in&s;truments of vengeance, but are &s;alutary in le&s;&s;ening the numbers of tho&s;e ani|mals which are highly u&s;eful in the degree, and only hurtful in their exce&s;s; but if their bad qualities are &s;erviceable, we are more indebted to their good ones than we chu&s;e to acknowlege.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="8">But many of the animals that form this cla&s;s are of immediate benefit to mankind. The Turtle, or Sea-Tortoi&s;e, &s;upplies the torrid zone with a whole|&s;ome and delicious food, as the epicures of our own country can atte&s;t. Frogs are a food in &s;everal parts, as Lizards and Serpents are in others.</P>
<P>The medicinal virtues of the Viper are partly ex|ploded by the moderns, but time, the overthrower of &s;y&s;tems, as well as empires, may re&s;tore it to the rank it held with the antients. The <HI>Lacerta Scincus</HI> is, however, yet e&s;teemed in the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> for its &s;alubrious qualities, and even Toads have contri|buted to the ea&s;e of patients in the mo&s;t inveterate of all di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Had I followed <HI>Linnaeus,</HI> and included the Carti|laginous Fi&s;h in this cla&s;s, there would have been ample room for panegyric, for it is very doubtful whether any are pernicious; but the u&s;es of many, either as food or for mechanical purpo&s;es, were never que&s;tioned.</P>
<P>But if the external figure of the reptile tribe is di&s;gu&s;ting, they have one general beauty, an apt configuration of parts for their way of life, nor are they de&s;titute of their peculiar graces: the fine di&s;|po&s;ition of plates in the &s;hell of the Tortoi&s;e, with the elegant &s;ymmetry of their colors, mu&s;t &s;trike even common ob&s;ervers, while the eye of the de|&s;pi&s;ed Toad has a lu&s;tre denied to more plea&s;ing forms. The frolic&s;ome agility of Lizards enlivens the dried banks in hot climates, and the great affec|tion which &s;ome of them &s;hew to mankind, &s;hould farther engage our regard and attention.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="9">The wreathing of the Snake, with the vivid die of its &s;kin, are certainly graceful, tho' from the dread of &s;ome particular &s;pecies which are venemous, we have acquired an antipathy for the whole. The antients, who con&s;idered the Serpent as an emblem of health, could a&s;&s;ociate plea&s;ing ideas with this animal. We therefore find it an ornament at every entertainment, and in every &s;cene of mirth, both in painting and in &s;culpture. <HI>Virgil</HI> adopted this notion, and has accordingly de&s;cribed it with every beauty both of form and color,
<Q><L><HI>Adytis cum lubricus anguis ab imis</HI></L>

<P>THIS &s;pecies (if the <HI>te&s;tudo coriacea</HI>) &s;eems com|mon to the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> and to our &s;outhern &s;eas, and is not, as far as we know, di&s;covered in any other.</P>
<P>Two were taken on the coa&s;t of <HI>Cornwall</HI> in the mackrel nets, of a va&s;t &s;ize, a little after <HI>Mid&s;um|mer</HI> 1756; the large&s;t weighed eight hundred pounds, the le&s;&s;er near &s;even hundred.</P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Borla&s;e</HI> fir&s;t publi&s;hed the&s;e animals to the world, and di&s;covered them in our &s;eas.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="12">He de&s;cribes them as having &s;even &s;piny or &s;er|rated ridges running from the head to the tail, di|viding the upper part of the back into equal parts.</P>
<P>The fore legs, as appear by his figure, are remark|ably long and narrow, flat, &s;mooth, and fle&s;hy, being de&s;titute of &s;cales. The color of their upper &s;ide blui&s;h, their under &s;ide, as well as that of the neck, ruddy, &s;peckled with black.</P>
<P>We &s;u&s;pect an error in the number of the hind legs, the figure being repre&s;ented with four, an ex|ce&s;s we never have met with in any of this genus.</P>
<P>The head is painted extremely &s;mall, in propor|tion to the &s;ize of the animal, who&s;e length was &s;ix feet nine inches, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Size.</NOTE> and breadth from the tip of one fore leg to that of the other ten feet four inches.</P>
<P>The covering of this &s;pecies is compared to that of the <HI>Te&s;tudo coriacea</HI> of <HI>Rondeletius,</HI> which has an integument re&s;embling a tough &s;trong hide; and what is very &s;ingular, neither that of the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> &s;pe|cies, nor yet that of the <HI>French</HI> naturali&s;t, &s;eem by the figures to be divided into angular compartments by tran&s;ver&s;e &s;utures, like the &s;hells of all tortoi&s;es we have ever met with. But the hi&s;tory of this kind remains &s;till very ob&s;cure: it is therefore to be wi&s;h|ed, that particular attention be paid to the next that is taken on our coa&s;ts; and that ob&s;ervation be made whether the covering is cru&s;taceous or coriaceous, that we may be a&s;&s;ured that the&s;e were the <HI>European</HI> kind, not the <HI>American;</HI> it &s;eeming not improbable but they might be a couple that had e&s;caped out of &s;ome <HI>We&s;t India</HI> &s;hip that had foundered, or been ca&s;t away near the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> coa&s;t.</P>

<P>SO common and well-known an animal requires no de&s;cription; but &s;ome of its properties are &s;o &s;ingular that we cannot pa&s;s them unnoticed.</P>
<P>Its &s;pring or power of taking large leaps is remark|ably great, and it is the be&s;t &s;wimmer of all four-footed animals. Nature hath finely adapted its parts for tho&s;e ends, the fore members of the body being very lightly made, the hind legs and thighs very long, and furni&s;hed with very &s;trong mu&s;cles.</P>
<P>While in a tadpole &s;tate it is entirely a water-ani|mal; the work of generation is performed in that element, as may be &s;een in every pond during &s;pring; when the female remains oppre&s;&s;ed by the male for a number of days.</P>
<P>The work of propagation is extremely &s;ingular, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Genera|tion.</NOTE> it being certain that the frog has not a <HI>penis intrans;</HI> there appears a &s;trong analogy in this ca&s;e between a certain cla&s;s of the vegetable kingdom and tho&s;e
<PB N="4" REF="14">animals; for it is well known, that when the female frog depo&s;its its &s;pawn, the male in&s;tantaneou&s;ly im|pregnates it with what we may call a <HI>farina foecundans,</HI> in the &s;ame manner as the male <HI>Palm</HI> tree conveys fructification to the flowers of the female, which would otherwi&s;e be barren <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shaw's Travels, <HI>224.</HI> Ha&s;&s;elqui&s;t Trav. Engl. Ed. <HI>416.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>As &s;oon as the frogs are relea&s;ed from their tad|pole &s;tate they immediately take to land; and if the weather has been hot, and there fall any refre&s;hing &s;howers, you may &s;ee the ground for a con&s;iderable &s;pace perfectly blackened by Myriads of the&s;e ani|malcules, &s;eeking for &s;ome &s;ecure lurking places. Some philo&s;ophers <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Rondeletius, <HI>216.</HI> Wormii Mu&s;. <HI>327.</HI></NOTE> not giving them&s;elves time to examine into this phaenomenon, imagined them to have been generated in the clouds, and &s;howered on the earth; but had they, like our <HI>Derham,</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ray's Wi&s;dom Creat. <HI>316.</HI></NOTE> but traced them to the next pool, they would have found a better &s;olution of the difficulty.</P>
<P>As frogs adhere clo&s;ely to the backs of their own &s;pecies, &s;o we know they will do the &s;ame by fi&s;h: <HI>Walton</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Complete Angler, <HI>161.</HI></NOTE> mentions a &s;trange &s;tory of their de&s;troying pike; but that they will injure, if not entirely kill carp, is a fact indi&s;putable, from the following rela|tion: a very few years ago on fi&s;hing a pond belong|ing to Mr. <HI>Pit,</HI> of <HI>Encomb, Dor&s;et&s;hire,</HI> great num|bers of the carp were found each with a frog mount|ed on it, the hind legs clinging to the back, the fore legs fixed in the corner of each eye of the fi&s;h, which were thin and greatly wa&s;ted, teized by car|rying
<PB N="5" REF="15">&s;o di&s;agreeable a load. The&s;e frogs we ima|gine to have been males di&s;appointed of a mate.</P>

<P><HI>Morton</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t.

Frogs are certainly endued (as he well ob&s;erved) with a power of living a good while under water without re&s;piration, which is owing to their lungs being compo&s;ed of a &s;eries of bladders: but he mi&s;takes the nature of air, when he affirms that they receive a quantity of cool air, and dare not open their mouths for a month, from a dread of admitting a warmer into their lungs. It is hardly nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay, that in whatever &s;tate the air was received, it
<PB N="6" REF="16">would a&s;&s;imilate it&s;elf to the external atmo&s;phere in a &s;hort time. We mu&s;t leave the fact to be ac|counted for by farther experiments. But from what we do know, we may partly vindicate <HI>Theophra&s;|tus,</HI> and other antients, about the &s;ilence of the frogs at <HI>Seriphus.</HI> That philo&s;opher affirms it, but a&s;|cribes it to the coldne&s;s of the waters in that i&s;land: Now when Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tournefort</HI> was there, the wa|ters were lukewarm, and the frogs had recovered their voices. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tournefort's voy. <HI>I. 142.</HI></NOTE> Is it not probable that <HI>Theophra&s;tus</HI> might be at <HI>Seriphus</HI> at that &s;ea&s;on when the frogs were mute, and having never ob&s;erved it el&s;ewhere, might conclude their &s;ilence to be general as to the time, but particular as to the place. <HI>Aelian</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Aelian lib. <HI>iii.</HI> ch. <HI>35, 37.</HI></NOTE>, who quotes <HI>Theophra&s;tus</HI> for the la&s;t pa&s;&s;age, a&s;cribes the &s;ame &s;ilence to the frogs of the lake <HI>Pierus</HI> in <HI>The&s;|&s;aly,</HI> and about <HI>Cyrene</HI> in <HI>Africa:</HI> but he is &s;o un|certain a writer, that we cannot affirm whether the &s;pecies of the <HI>African</HI> frogs is the &s;ame with ours.</P>

<P>THE mo&s;t deformed and hideous of all ani|mals; the body broad, the back flat, and co|vered with a pimply du&s;ky hide; the belly large,
<PB N="8" REF="18">&s;wagging, and &s;welling out; the legs &s;hort, and its pace labored and crawling: its retreat gloomy and filthy: in &s;hort, its general appearance is &s;uch as to &s;trike one with di&s;gu&s;t and horror; yet we have been told by tho&s;e who have re&s;olution to view it with at|tention, that its eyes are fine: to this it &s;eems that <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> alludes, when he makes his <HI>Juliet</HI> remark, Some &s;ay the lark and loathed toad change eyes. As if they would have been better be&s;towed on &s;o charming a &s;ong&s;ter than on this raucous reptile.</P>
<P>But the hideous appearance of the toad is &s;uch as to make this one advantageous feature overlooked, and to have rendered it in all ages an object of hor|ror, and the origin of mo&s;t tremendous inventions. <HI>Aelian</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. an. lib. <HI>ix.</HI> c. <HI>11.</HI></NOTE> makes its venom &s;o potent, that <HI>Ba&s;ili&s;k</HI>-like it conveyed death by its very look and breath; but <HI>Juvenal</HI> is content with making the <HI>Roman</HI> ladies, who were weary of their hu&s;bands, form a potion from its entrails, <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Sat. <HI>vi. 658.

<L>(To ea&s;e his pains) the toad's envenom'd juice.</L></Q>
<P>This opinion begat others of a more dreadful na|ture; for in after-times &s;uper&s;tition gave it preterna|tural
<PB N="9" REF="19">powers, and made it a principal ingredient in the incantations of nocturnal hags:
<Q><L>Toad that under the cold &s;tone,</L>

<L>Swelter'd venom &s;leeping got,</L>
<L>Boil thou, <HI>fir&s;t</HI> i' th' charmed pot.</L></Q></P>
<P>We know by the poet that this charm was in|tended for a de&s;ign of the fir&s;t con&s;ideration, that of rai&s;ing the dead from their repo&s;e, and bringing be|fore the eyes of <HI>Macbeth</HI> a hateful &s;econd-&s;ight of the pro&s;perity of <HI>Banquo</HI>'s line.</P>
<P>This &s;hews the mighty powers attributed to this animal by the dealers in the magic art; but the powers our poet indues it with, are far &s;uperior to tho&s;e than <HI>Ge&s;ner</HI> a&s;cribes to it: <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s witches u&s;ed it to di&s;turb the dead; <HI>Ge&s;ner</HI>'s, only to &s;till the living, <HI>Ut vim coeundi ni fallor, in viris tollerent.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. quad. ovip. <HI>72.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>We may add here another &s;uper&s;tition in re&s;pect to this animal: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Toad|&s;tone.</NOTE> it was believed by &s;ome old writers to have a &s;tone in its head, fraught with great vir|tues medical and magical: it was di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the Reptile, and called the <HI>Toad-Stone, Bufo|nites, Crapaudine, Krotten&s;tein;</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Boet. de Boot. de Lap. et Gam. <HI>301.303.</HI></NOTE> but all its fancied powers vani&s;hed on the di&s;covery of its being nothing but the fo&s;&s;il tooth of the <HI>&s;ea wolf,</HI> or of &s;ome flat|toothed fi&s;h, not unfrequent in our i&s;land, as well as &s;everal other countries; but we may well excu&s;e this tale, &s;ince <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has extracted from it a &s;imile of uncommon beauty:
<PB N="10" REF="20">
<Q><L>Sweet are the u&s;es of adver&s;ity,</L>
<L>Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,</L>
<L>Wears yet a precious jewel in his head.</L></Q></P>
<P>But the&s;e fables have been long exploded: we &s;hall now return to the notion of its being a poi&s;on|ous animal, and deliver as our opinion, that its ex|ce&s;&s;ive deformity, joined to the faculty it has of emitting a juice from its pimples, and a du&s;ky li|quid from its hind parts, is the foundation of the report.</P>
<P>That it has any noxious qualities we have been unable to bring proofs in the &s;malle&s;t degree &s;atis|factory, tho' we have heard many &s;trange relations on that point.</P>
<P>On the contrary, we know &s;everal of our friends who have taken them in their naked hands, and held them long without receiving the le&s;t injury: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Not poi|&s;onous.</NOTE> It is al&s;o well known that quacks have eaten them, and have be&s;ides &s;queezed their juices into a gla&s;s, and drank them with impunity.</P>
<P>We may &s;ay al&s;o, that the&s;e reptiles are a common food to many animals; to <HI>buzzards, owls, Norfolk plovers, ducks,</HI> and <HI>&s;nakes,</HI> who would not touch them were they in any degree noxious.</P>
<P>So far from having venomous qualities, they have of late been con&s;idered as if they had beneficent ones. We wi&s;h, for the benefit of mankind, that we could make a favorable report of the many at|tempts of late to cure the mo&s;t terrible of di&s;ea&s;es the <HI>cancer,</HI> by the application of live toads; but,
<PB N="11" REF="21">alas, they &s;eem only to have rendered a horrible complaint more loath&s;ome.</P>
<P>In a word, we may con&s;ider the toad as an animal that has neither good nor harm in it; that being a defencele&s;s creature, nature has furni&s;hed it, in&s;tead of arms, with a mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting deformity, that &s;trikes into almo&s;t every Being capable of annoying it, a &s;trong repugnancy to meddle with &s;o hideous and threatening an appearance.</P>
<P>The time of their propagation is very early in the &s;pring: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Genera|tion.</NOTE> at that &s;ea&s;on the females are &s;een crawl|ing about oppre&s;&s;ed by the males, who continue on them for &s;ome hours, and adhere &s;o fa&s;t as to tear the very &s;kin from the Parts they &s;tick to.

Nat. <HI>355.</HI></NOTE> &s;ays they are, and diverts us with a report he had heard, that the male acts the midwife to the female in parturition.</P>
<P>To conclude this account with the marvellous, this animal is &s;aid to have often been found in the mid&s;t of &s;olid rocks, and even in the centre of growing trees, impri&s;oned in a &s;mall hollow, to which there was not the lea&s;t adit or entrance <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Plot'<HI>s</HI> Hi&s;t.

<P>THOSE we have &s;een differ in color, but agree in all other re&s;pects with the &s;pecies de&s;cribed by Doctor <HI>Plot.</HI> Their length from the no&s;e to the hind legs was three inches; from thence to the end of the tail three and three quarters.</P>
<P>Along the back was a black li&s;t; each &s;ide of that a brown one: then &s;ucceeded a narrow &s;tripe, &s;pot|ted alternately yellow and brown; beneath that a broad black one; tho&s;e ended a little beyond the hind legs. The belly was yellow, and the &s;cales large but even. The &s;cales on the back &s;mall; on the tail the ends projected: tho&s;e on the latter were varied with black and brown.</P>
<P>The legs and feet were du&s;ky; on each foot were five toes, furni&s;hed with claws.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="25">This &s;pecies is extremely nimble: in hot weather it ba&s;ks on the &s;ides of dry banks, or of old trees; but on being ob&s;erved immediately retreats to its hole.</P>
<P>The food of this &s;pecies, as of all the other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> lizards, is in&s;ects: they them&s;elves of birds of prey. Each of our lizards are perfectly harmle&s;s; yet their form is what &s;trikes one with di&s;gu&s;t, and has occa|&s;ioned great ob&s;curity in their hi&s;tory.</P>

<P>This &s;pecies we have frequently &s;een in the &s;tate we de&s;cribe, but are uncertain whether we ever met with it under the form of a <HI>larve.</HI> We have more than once found under &s;tones and old logs, &s;ome very minute young lizards that had much the appear|ance of this kind: they were perfectly formed, and had not the lea&s;t ve&s;tiges of fins; &s;o that circum|&s;tance joined to their being found in a dry place, re|mote from water, makes us imagine them to have
<PB N="16" REF="27">never been inhabitants of that element, as it is cer|tain many of our lizards are in their fir&s;t &s;tate.</P>

<P>From this &s;ome have imagined that the viper is &s;o unnatural as to devour its own young; we di&s;believe the fact, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Food.</NOTE> it being well known the food of the&s;e &s;er|pents is frogs, toads, lizards, mice, and, according to Doctor <HI>Mead,</HI> even an animal &s;o large as a mole. The&s;e they &s;wallow entire; which if we con&s;ider the narrowne&s;s of their neck, &s;hews it is capable of a di&s;ten&s;ion hardly credible, had we not ocular proofs of the fact.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="31">It is al&s;o &s;aid, from good authority, that they will prey on young birds; whether on &s;uch as ne&s;tle on the ground, or whether they climb up trees for them as the <HI>Indian</HI> &s;erpents do, we are quite uncer|tain; but we are well a&s;&s;ured that this di&s;covery is far from a recent one:
<Q><L><HI>Ut a&s;&s;idens implumibus pullis avis</HI></L>
<L><HI>Serpentium allap&s;us timet</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hor. Epod. <HI>I.</HI></NOTE></L>
<L>Thus, for its young the anxious bird</L>
<L>The gliding &s;erpent fears.</L></Q></P>
<P>The viper is capable of &s;upporting very long ab|&s;tinence, it being known that &s;ome have been kept in a box &s;ix months without food, yet did not abate of their vivacity. They feed only a &s;mall part of the year, but never during their confinement; for if mice, their favorite diet, &s;hould at that time be thrown into their box, tho' they will kill, yet they never will eat them.</P>
<P>The poi&s;on decrea&s;es in violence in proportion to the length of their confinement: it mu&s;t be al&s;o added the virtues of its fle&s;h (what&s;oever they be) are at the &s;ame time con&s;iderably le&s;&s;ened.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals, when at liberty, remain torpid throughout the winter; yet when confined have never been ob&s;erved to take their annual repo&s;e.</P>
<P>The method of catching them is by putting a clift &s;tick on or near their head; after which they are &s;eized by the tail, and put in&s;tantly into a bag.</P>
<P>The viper-catchers are very frequently bit by them in the pur&s;uit of their bu&s;ine&s;s, yet we very rarely
<PB N="21" REF="32">hear of the bite being fatal. The remedy, if ap|plied in time, is very certain, and is nothing el&s;e but &s;allad oil, which the viper-catchers &s;eldom go with|out. The <HI>axungia viperina,</HI> or the fat of vipers, is al&s;o another. Doctor <HI>Mead</HI> &s;u&s;pects the efficacy of this la&s;t, and &s;ub&s;titutes one of his own in its place <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay on Poi&s;ons, <HI>47.</HI></NOTE>; but we had rather tru&s;t to vulgar receipts which per|petual trials have &s;hewn to be infallible.</P>
<P>The &s;ymptoms of the venom, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Effects of its bite.</NOTE> if the wound is neglected, are very terrible: it fir&s;t cau&s;es an acute pain in the place affected, attended with a &s;welling, fir&s;t red, afterwards livid, which by degrees &s;preads to the neighbouring parts; great faintne&s;s, and a quick tho' low and interrupted pul&s;e en&s;ue; great &s;ickne&s;s at the &s;tomach, bilious convul&s;ive vomitings, cold &s;weats, and &s;ometimes pains about the navel; and in con&s;equence of the&s;e death it&s;elf <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Lib. <HI>xxix.</HI> c. <HI>3.</HI></NOTE>. But the violence of the &s;ymptoms depends much on the &s;ea&s;on of the year, the difference of the climate, the &s;ize or rage of the animal, or the depth or &s;ituation of the wound.</P>
<P>Dreadful as the effects of its bite may be, yet its fle&s;h has been long celebrated as a noble medicine. Doctor <HI>Mead</HI> cites from <HI>Pliny, Galen,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">U&s;es.</NOTE> and other an|tients, &s;everal proofs of its efficacy in the cure of <HI>ulcers,</HI> the <HI>elephantia&s;is,</HI> and other bad complaints. He even &s;ays he has &s;een good effects from it in an ob&s;tinate <HI>lepra:</HI> it is at pre&s;ent u&s;ed as a re&s;torative, tho' we think the modern phy&s;icians have no great dependence on its virtues. The antients pre&s;cribed
<PB N="22" REF="33">it boiled, and to be eaten as fi&s;h; for when fre&s;h, the medicine was much more likely to take effect than when dried, and given in form of a powder or troche.</P>
<P>The antient <HI>Britons</HI> had a &s;trange &s;uper&s;tition in re&s;pect to the&s;e animals, and of which there &s;till remains in <HI>Wales</HI> a &s;trong tradition. The account <HI>Pliny</HI> gives of it is as follows: we &s;hall not attempt a tran&s;lation, it being already done to our hands in a &s;pirited manner by the ingenious Mr. <HI>Ma&s;on,</HI> which we &s;hall take the liberty of borrowing.</P>

<P>THE &s;nake is the large&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;er|pents, &s;ometimes exceeding four feet in length: the neck is &s;lender; the middle of the body thicke&s;t; the back and &s;ides covered with &s;mall &s;cales, the belly with oblong, narrow, tran&s;ver&s;e plates.

<P>The color of the back and &s;ides of the &s;nake are du&s;ky or brown; <NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;cr.</NOTE> the middle of the back marked with two rows of &s;mall black &s;pots running from head to tail; and from them are multitudes of lines of &s;pots cro&s;&s;ing the &s;ides; the plates on the belly are du&s;ky, the &s;cales on the &s;ides of a blui&s;h white.</P>
<P>On each &s;ide the neck is a &s;pot of pale yellow, and the ba&s;e of each is a triangular black &s;pot, one angle of which points towards the tail.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="36">The teeth are &s;mall and &s;errated, lying each &s;ide the jaw in two rows.</P>

<P>NATURE on this tribe hath be&s;towed an in|ternal &s;tructure in all re&s;pects agreeing with that of quadrupeds; and in a few other the external parts in both are &s;imilar.</P>
<P>Cetaceous Fi&s;h, like land animals, breathe by means of lungs, being de&s;titute of gills. This obliges them to ri&s;e frequently to the &s;urface of the water to re&s;pire, to &s;leep on the &s;urface, as well as to perform &s;everal other functions.</P>
<P>They have the power of uttering &s;ounds, &s;uch as bellowing and making other noi&s;es, a faculty denied to genuine fi&s;h <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pontop. Hi&s;t. Norw. <HI>ii. 123.</HI> Bla&s;ius Anat. Animal, <HI>288.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Like land animals they have warm blood, are fur|ni&s;hed with organs of generation, copulate, bring forth, and &s;uckle their young, &s;hewing a &s;trong at|tachment to them.</P>
<P>Their bodies beneath the &s;kin are entirely &s;ur|rounded with a thick layer of fat (blubber) analo|gous to the lard on hogs.</P>
<P>The number of their fins never exceeds three, <HI>viz.</HI> two pectoral fins, and one back fin; but in &s;ome &s;pecies the la&s;t is wanting.</P>
<P>Their tails are placed horizontally or flat in re&s;pect to their bodies; contrary to the direction of tho&s;e of all other fi&s;h, which have them in a perpendicular &s;ite. This &s;ituation of the tail enables them to force them&s;elves &s;uddenly to the &s;urface of the water

<P>THIS &s;pecies is the large&s;t of all animals: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Size.</NOTE> it is even at pre&s;ent &s;ometimes found in the north|ern &s;eas ninety feet in length; but formerly they were taken of a much greater &s;ize, when the captures were le&s;s frequent, and the fi&s;h had time to grow. Such is their bulk within the <HI>arctic</HI> circle, but in tho&s;e of the <HI>torrid</HI> zone, where they are unmole&s;ted, whales are &s;till &s;een one hundred and &s;ixty feet long <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Adan&s;on's voy.</HI> 174. From this account we find no rea&s;on to di&s;believe the va&s;t &s;ize of the <HI>Indian</HI> whales, of who&s;e bones and jaws, both <HI>Strabo, lib.</HI> xv. and <HI>Pliny, lib.</HI> ix. <HI>c.</HI> 3. relate, that the natives made their hou&s;es, u&s;ing the jaws for door-ca&s;es. This method of building was formerly practi&s;ed by the inha|bitants of <HI>Greenland,</HI> as we find from <HI>Frobi&s;her,</HI> in his &s;econd voyage, p. 18, publi&s;hed in 1578.</NOTE></P>
<P>The head is very much di&s;proportioned to the &s;ize of the body, being one-third the &s;ize of the fi&s;h: the under lip is much broader than the upper. The tongue is compo&s;ed of a &s;oft &s;pongy fat, capable of
<PB N="36" REF="50">yielding five or &s;ix barrels of oil. The gullet is very &s;mall for &s;o va&s;t a fi&s;h, not exceeding four inches in width. In the middle of the head are two orifices, thro' which it &s;pouts water to a va&s;t height, and with a great noi&s;e, e&s;pecially when di&s;turbed or wounded.</P>
<P>The eyes are no larger than tho&s;e of an ox.</P>
<P>On the back there is no fin, but on the &s;ides, be|neath each eye, are two large ones.</P>
<P>The penis is eight feet in length, inclo&s;ed in a &s;trong &s;heath. The teats in the female are placed in the lower part of the belly.</P>
<P>The tail is broad and &s;emilunar.</P>
<P>This whale varies in color: the back of &s;ome being red, the belly generally white. Others are black, &s;ome mottled, others quite white, according to the ob&s;ervations of <HI>Marten,</HI> who &s;ays, that their colors in the water are extremely beautiful, and that their &s;kin is very &s;mooth and &s;lippery.</P>
<P>What is called <HI>whalebone</HI> adheres to the upper jaw, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Whale|bone.</NOTE> and is formed of thin parallel laminae, &s;ome of the longe&s;t four yards in length; of the&s;e there are com|monly 350 on each &s;ide, but in very old fi&s;h more; of the&s;e about 500 are of a length fit for u&s;e, the others being too &s;hort. They are &s;urrounded with long &s;trong hair, not only that they may not hurt the tongue, but as &s;trainers to prevent the return of their food when they di&s;charge the water out of their mouths.</P>
<P>It is from the&s;e hairs that <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> gave the name of <GAP DESC="foreign">, or the <HI>bearded whale,</HI> to this &s;pecies, which he tells us had in its mouth hairs in&s;tead of

<P>The whale, tho' &s;o bulky an animal, &s;wims with va&s;t &s;wiftne&s;s, and generally again&s;t the wind.</P>
<P>It brings only two young at a time, as we believe is the ca&s;e with all other whales.</P>
<P>Its food is a certain &s;ort of &s;mall &s;nail, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Food.</NOTE> and as <HI>Lin|noeus</HI> &s;ays, the <HI>medu&s;a,</HI> or &s;ea blubber.</P>

<P>To view the&s;e animals in a commercial light, we mu&s;t add, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were late before they en|gaged in the whale-fi&s;hery: it appears by a &s;et of queries, propo&s;ed by an hone&s;t merchant in the year 1575, in order to get information in the bu&s;ine&s;s, that we were at that time totally ignorant of it, be|ing obliged to &s;end to <HI>Bi&s;kaie for men &s;kilful in the catching of the whale, and ordering of the oil, and one cooper &s;kilful to &s;et up the &s;taved ca&s;k</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hackluyt'<HI>s</HI> Col. voy. <HI>I. 414.</HI></NOTE> This &s;eems very &s;trange; for by the account <HI>Octher</HI> gave of his travels to King <HI>Alfred,</HI> near 700 years <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Idem <HI>I. 4.</HI></NOTE> before that period, it is evident that he made that monarch ac|quainted with the <HI>Norwegians</HI> practi&s;ing the whale-fi&s;hery; but it &s;eems all memory of that gainful employ, as well as of that able voyager <HI>Octher,</HI> and all his important di&s;coveries in the North were lo&s;t for near &s;even centuries.</P>
<P>It was carried on by the <HI>Bi&s;cayeners</HI> long before we attempted the trade, and that for the &s;ake not only of the oil, but al&s;o of the whalebone, which they &s;eem to have long trafficked in. The earlie&s;t notice we find of that article in our trade is by <HI>Hackluyt</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hackluyt <HI>III. 194.</HI></NOTE>, who &s;ays it was brought from the <HI>Bay of St. Lau|rence</HI> by an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hip that went there for the <HI>barbes</HI> and <HI>fynnes</HI> of whales and train oil, A.

<P>The great re&s;ort of the&s;e animals was found to be on the inho&s;pitable &s;hores of <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> and the <HI>European</HI> &s;hips made that place their principal fi&s;hery, and for numbers of years were very &s;ucce&s;sful: the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> commenced that bu&s;ine&s;s about the year 1598, and the town of <HI>Hull</HI> had the honor of fir&s;t attempting that profitable branch of trade. At pre&s;ent it &s;eems to be on the decline, the quantity of fi&s;h being greatly reduced by the con&s;tant capture for &s;uch a va&s;t length of time: &s;ome recent ac|counts inform us, that the fi&s;hers, from a defect of whales, apply them&s;elves to the &s;eal fi&s;hery, from which animals they extract an oil. This we fear will not be of any long continuance; for the&s;e &s;hy and timid creatures will &s;oon be induced to quit tho&s;e &s;hores by being perpetually harra&s;&s;ed, as the <HI>mor&s;e</HI> or <HI>walrus</HI> has already in a great mea&s;ure done.

We are at a lo&s;s to account for the origin of tho&s;e fables, &s;ince it does not appear that the dolphin &s;hews a greater attachment to mankind than the re&s;t of the cetaceous tribe. We know that at pre&s;ent the ap|pearance of this fi&s;h, and the porpe&s;&s;e, are far from being e&s;teemed favorable omens by the &s;eamen; for their boundings, &s;prings and frolics in the water, are held to be &s;ure &s;igns of an approaching gale.</P>
<P>It is from their leaps out of that element that they a&s;&s;ume a temporary form that is not natural to them, but which the old painters and &s;culptors have almo&s;t always given them. A dolphin is &s;carce ever exhibited by the antients in a &s;trait &s;hape, but almo&s;t always incurvated: &s;uch are tho&s;e on the coin of <HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> which is pre&s;erved by <HI>Belon,</HI> as well as on &s;everal other pieces of antiquity. The poets de&s;cribe them much in the &s;ame manner, and it is not improbable but that the one had borrowed from the other:

<P>Lampreys are &s;ometimes found &s;o large as to weigh four or five pounds.</P>

<P>THE weapon with which nature hath armed this fi&s;h, hath &s;upplied the antients with many tremendous fables relating to it. <HI>Pliny, Aelian,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hi&s;t. an. lib.</HI> ii. <HI>c.</HI> 36.</NOTE> and <HI>Oppian,</HI> have given it a venom that affects even the inanimate creation: trees that are &s;truck by it in&s;tantly lo&s;e their verdure and peri&s;h, and rocks them&s;elves are incapable of re&s;i&s;ting the potent poi&s;on.</P>
<P>The enchantre&s;s <HI>Circe,</HI> armed her &s;on with a &s;pear headed with the &s;pine of the <HI>Trygon,</HI> as the mo&s;t ir|re&s;i&s;tible weapon &s;he could furni&s;h him with, and with which he afterwards committed parricide, unin|tentionally, on his father <HI>Uly&s;&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>That &s;pears and darts might, in very early times, have been headed with this bone in&s;tead of iron, we have no kind of doubt: that of another &s;pecies of this fi&s;h being &s;till u&s;ed to point the arrows of &s;ome of the <HI>South American Indians,</HI> and is, from its hard|ne&s;s, &s;harpne&s;s, and beards, a mo&s;t dreadful weapon.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="88">But in re&s;pect to its venemous qualities there is not the le&s;t credit to be given to the opinion, tho' it was believed (as far as it affected the animal world) by <HI>Rondeletius, Aldrovand,</HI> and others, and even to this day by the fi&s;hermen in &s;everal parts of the kingdom. It is in fact the weapon of of|fence belonging to the fi&s;h, capable of giving a very bad wound, and which is attended with dangerous &s;ymptoms, when it falls on a tendinous part, or on a per&s;on in a bad habit of body. As to any fi&s;h having a &s;pine charged with actual poi&s;on, we mu&s;t deny our a&s;&s;ent to it, tho' the report is &s;anctified by the name of <HI>Linnoeus</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sy&s;t.

<P>This &s;pecies does not grow to the bulk of the the others: <NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;cr.</NOTE> that which we examined was two feet nine inches from the tip of the no&s;e to the end of the tail; to the origin of the tail one foot three inches; the breadth one foot eight.</P>
<P>The body is quite &s;mooth, of a &s;hape almo&s;t round, and is of a much greater thickne&s;s, and more elevated form in the middle than any other <HI>Rays,</HI> but grows very thin towards the edges.</P>
<P>The no&s;e is very &s;harp pointed, but &s;hort; the mouth &s;mall, and filled with granulated teeth.</P>
<P>The irides are of a gold color: behind each eye the orifice is very large.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="89">The tail is very thick at the beginning: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tail.</NOTE> the &s;pine is placed about a third the length of the former from the body, is about five inches long, flat on the top and bottom, very hard, &s;harp pointed, and the two &s;ides thin, and clo&s;ely and &s;harply bearded the whole way.

<P>THIS is the fi&s;h which connects the genus of rays and &s;harks, partaking &s;omething of the character of both; yet in an exception to each in the &s;ituation of the mouth, which is placed at the extremity of the head.</P>
<P>It is a fi&s;h not unfrequent on mo&s;t of our coa&s;ts, where it prowls about for prey like others of the kind. It is extremely voracious, and, like the ray,
<PB N="75" REF="91">feeds on flounders and flat fi&s;h, which keep at the bot|tom of the water, as we have often found on open|ing them. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fierce|ne&s;s.</NOTE> It is extremely fierce and dangerous to be approached. We knew an in&s;tance of a fi&s;her|man, who&s;e leg was terribly tore by a large one of this &s;pecies, which lay within his nets in &s;hallow wa|ter, and which he went to lay hold of incautiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>The a&s;pect of the&s;e, as well as the re&s;t of the ge|nus, have much malignity in them: their eyes are oblong, and placed lengthways in their head, funk in it, and overhung by the &s;kin, and &s;eem fuller of malevolence than fire.</P>
<P>Their &s;kin is very rough; the antients made u&s;e of it to poli&s;h wood and ivory <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Qua lignum et ebora poliuntur. <HI>Plinii lib.</HI> ix. <HI>c.</HI> 12.</NOTE>, as we do at pre&s;ent that of the greater dog-fi&s;h. The fle&s;h is now but little e&s;teemed on account of its coar&s;ene&s;s and rankne&s;s, yet <HI>Arche&s;tratus</HI> (as quoted by <HI>Athenaeus,</HI> p. 319) &s;peaking of the fi&s;h of <HI>Miletus,</HI> gives this the fir&s;t place in re&s;pect to its delicacy of the whole cartilaginous tribe.</P>
<P>They grow to a great &s;ize; <NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;cr.</NOTE> we have &s;een them of near an hundred weight.</P>
<P>The head is large, the teeth broad at their ba&s;e, but &s;lender and very &s;harp above, and di&s;po&s;ed in five rows all round the jaws. Like tho&s;e of all &s;harks, they are capable of being rai&s;ed or depre&s;&s;ed by means of mu&s;cles uniting them to the jaws, not being lodged in &s;ockets as the teeth of cetaceous fi&s;h are.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="92">The tongue is large; the eyes &s;mall; the pupil of a pale green; the irides white, &s;potted with brown: behind each eye is a &s;emilunar orifice.</P>
<P>The back is of a pale a&s;h-color, and very rough; along the middle is a prickly tuberculated line: the belly is white and &s;mooth.</P>
<P>The pectoral fins are very large, and extend hori|zontally from the body to a great di&s;tance; they have &s;ome re&s;emblance to wings, &s;o writers have given this the name it bears in this work.</P>
<P>The ventral fins are placed in the &s;ame manner, and the double penis is placed in them, which forms another character of the males in this and the la&s;t genus.</P>
<P>The tail is bifurcated, the upper lobe rather the longe&s;t: not very remote from the end on the back are two fins.</P>

S. dentibus caninis, pinna dor&s;ali anteriore majore.</HI> He &s;ays it inhabites the <HI>arctic</HI> &s;eas, and feeds on <HI>medu&s;ae</HI> (&s;ea jellies) that it rivals the whale in &s;ize, has no orifice near the eyes, and has a &s;mall anal fin.</NOTE>; and what is wor&s;e, mi&s;|taken for and confounded with the <HI>luna</HI> of <HI>Rondele|tius,</HI> the &s;ame that our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> writers call the <HI>&s;un|fi&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> and <HI>Welch</HI> give it the &s;ame name, from its lying as if to &s;un it&s;elf on the &s;urface of the wa|ter; and for the &s;ame rea&s;on we have taken the li|berty of calling it the ba&s;king &s;hark. It was long taken for a &s;pecies of whale, till we pointed out the branchial orifices on the &s;ides, and the perpendicular &s;ite of the tail.</P>
<P>The&s;e are migratory fi&s;h, or at le&s;t it is but in a certain number of years that they are &s;een in mul|titudes on the <HI>Welch</HI> &s;eas, tho' in mo&s;t &s;ummers a &s;ingle and perhaps &s;trayed fi&s;h appears.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="95">They vi&s;ited the bays of <HI>Caernarvon&s;hire</HI> and <HI>An|gle&s;ea</HI> in va&s;t &s;hoals, in the &s;ummers of 1756 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some old people &s;ay they recollect the &s;ame &s;ort of fi&s;h vi&s;iting the&s;e &s;eas in va&s;t numbers about forty years ago.</NOTE>, and a few &s;ucceeding years, continuing there only the hot months, for they quitted the coa&s;t about <HI>Michael|mas,</HI> as if cold weather was di&s;agreeable to them.</P>
<P>They had nothing of the fierce and voracious na|ture of the &s;hark kind, and were &s;o tame as to &s;uf|fer them&s;elves to be &s;troked: they generally lay mo|tionle&s;s on the &s;urface, commonly on their bellies, but &s;ometimes, like tired &s;wimmers, on their backs.</P>
<P>Their food &s;eemed to con&s;i&s;t entirely of &s;ea plants, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Food.</NOTE> no remains of fi&s;h being ever di&s;covered in the &s;to|machs of numbers that were cut up, except &s;ome green &s;tuff, the half dige&s;ted parts of algae, and the like.</P>
<P>At certain times they were &s;een &s;porting on the waves, and leaping with va&s;t agility &s;everal feet out of the water.</P>
<P>Their length was from three to eleven yards, but the la&s;t was a rare &s;ize.</P>
<P>Their form was rather &s;lender, like others of the &s;hark kind.</P>
<P>The upper jaw was much longer than the lower, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Teeth.</NOTE> and blunt at the end. The mouth placed beneath, and each jaw furni&s;hed with numbers of &s;mall teeth: tho&s;e before were much bent, tho&s;e more remote in the jaws, were conic and &s;harp pointed.</P>
<P>On the &s;ides of the neck were five large tran&s;|ver&s;e apertures to the gills.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="96">On the back were two fins; the fir&s;t very large, not directly in the middle of the back, but rather nearer the head; the other &s;mall, and &s;ituated near the tail. On the lower part were four others, viz. two pectoral fins, and two ventral fins; the la&s;t placed ju&s;t beneath the hind fin of the back. Near the&s;e the male had two genitals, and between the&s;e fins was &s;ituated the pudendum of the female.</P>
<P>The tail was very large, and the upper part re|markably longer than the lower.</P>
<P>The color of the upper part of the body was a deep leaden; the belly white.</P>
<P>The &s;kin was rough, like &s;hagreen, but le&s;s &s;o on the belly than the back.</P>
<P>Within &s;ide the mouth, towards the throat, was a very &s;hort &s;ort of whalebone.</P>
<P>The liver was of a great &s;ize, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Liver.</NOTE> but that of the female was the large&s;t; &s;ome weighed above a thou|&s;and pounds, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oil.</NOTE> and yielded a great quantity of pure and &s;weet oil, fit for lamps, and al&s;o much u&s;ed by the people who took them, to cure brui&s;es, burns, and rheumatic complaints. A large fi&s;h has afforded to the captors a profit of twenty pounds. They were viviparous, a young one about a foot in length being found in the belly of a fi&s;h of this kind.</P>
<P>They were taken with harpoons with long lines fixed to them in much the &s;ame manner as whales are, and when &s;truck go off with va&s;t rapidity, and dart in&s;tantly to the bottom, taking with them forty or fifty fathom of line, and are a long time before they are quite &s;ubdued.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="97">The fi&s;hers ob&s;erved on them a &s;ort of leech of a reddi&s;h color, and about two feet long, but which fell off when the fi&s;h was brought to the &s;urface of the water, and left a white mark on the &s;kin.</P>
<P>The &s;ame per&s;ons a&s;&s;ert, that there were two &s;pe|cies of this fi&s;h; a le&s;&s;er &s;ort, about two yards in length, which had in the mouth only three rows of teeth, and tho&s;e larger than in the kind we have de&s;cribed, being an inch and an half long.</P>

<P>THIS grows to a very great bulk, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Size.</NOTE> <HI>Gillius</HI> &s;ays, to the weight of four thou&s;and pounds; and that in the belly of one was found a human corps entire, which is far from incredible, con&s;idering their va&s;t greedine&s;s after human fle&s;h.</P>
<P>They are the dread of the &s;ailors in all hot cli|mates, where they con&s;tantly attend the &s;hips in ex|pectation of what may drop overboard; a man that has that misfortune peri&s;hes without redemption: they have been &s;een to dart at him, like gudgeons to a worm. A ma&s;ter of a <HI>Guinea</HI> &s;hip informed me, that a rage of &s;uicide prevailed among his new bought &s;laves, from a notion the unhappy creatures had, that after death they &s;hould be re&s;tored again to their families, friends, and country. To convince them at le&s;t that they &s;hould not re-animate their bodies, he ordered one of their corp&s;es to be tied by
<PB N="83" REF="99">the heels to a rope, and lowered into the &s;ea, and tho' it was drawn up again as fa&s;t as the united force of the crew could be exerted, yet in that &s;hort &s;pace the &s;harks had devoured every part but the feet, which were &s;ecured at the end of the cord.</P>
<P>Swimmers very often peri&s;h by them; &s;ometimes they lo&s;e an arm or leg, and &s;ometimes are bit quite a&s;&s;under, &s;erving but for two mor&s;els for this rave|nous animal: a melancholy tale of this kind is re|lated in a <HI>We&s;t India</HI> ballad, pre&s;erved in Mr. <HI>Percy</HI>'s reliques of ancient <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> poetry <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> I. 331.</NOTE></P>
<P>The mouth of this fi&s;h is furni&s;hed with (&s;ome|times) a &s;ixfold row of teeth, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Teeth.</NOTE> flat, triangular, ex|ceedingly &s;harp at their edges, and finely &s;errated. We have one that is rather more than an inch and an half long. <HI>Grew</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rarities.</HI> 91.</NOTE> &s;ays, that tho&s;e in the jaws of a &s;hark two yards in length, are not half an inch, &s;o that the fi&s;h to which mine belonged mu&s;t have been &s;ix yards long, provided the teeth and body keep pace in their growth <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fo&s;&s;il teeth of this fi&s;h are very frequent in <HI>Malta,</HI> &s;ome of which are four inches long.</NOTE></P>
<P>This dreadful apparatus, when the fi&s;h is in a &s;tate of repo&s;e, lie quite flat in the mouth, but when he &s;eizes his prey, he has power of erecting them, by the help of a &s;et of mu&s;cles that join them to the jaw.</P>
<P>The mouth is placed far beneath, for which rea|&s;on the&s;e, as well as the re&s;t of the kind, are &s;aid to
<PB N="84" REF="100">be obliged to turn on their backs to &s;eize their prey, which is an ob&s;ervation as antient as the days of <HI>Pliny</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Omnia qutem carnivora &s;unt talia et &s;upina ve&s;cantur. lib. <HI>ix.</HI> c. <HI>24.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>The eyes are large; the back broad, flat, and &s;horter than that of other &s;harks. The tail is of a &s;emilunar form, but the upper part is longer than the lower. It has va&s;t &s;trength in the tail, and can &s;trike with great force, &s;o that the &s;ailors in&s;tantly cut it off with an axe as &s;oon as they draw one on board.</P>
<P>The pectoral fins are very large, which enables it to &s;wim with great &s;wiftne&s;s.</P>
<P>The color of the whole body and fins is a light a&s;h.</P>
<P>The antients were acquainted with this fi&s;h; and <HI>Oppian</HI> gives a long and entertaining account of its capture. Their fle&s;h is &s;ometimes eaten, but is e&s;|teemed both coar&s;e and rank.</P>

<P><HI>AELIAN</HI> relates &s;trange things of the affection this &s;pecies bears to its young: among others, he &s;ays, that it will permit the &s;mall brood, when in danger, to &s;wim down its mouth, and take &s;hel|ter
<PB N="85" REF="101">in its belly. This fact has been &s;ince confirmed by the ob&s;ervation of one of our be&s;t icthyologi&s;ts <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rondeletius, <HI>388.</HI></NOTE>, and is no more incredible, than that the young of the <HI>Opo&s;&s;um</HI> &s;hould &s;eek an a&s;ylum in the ventral pouch of its parent, a fact too well known to be conte&s;ted. But this degree of care is not peculiar to the blue &s;hark, but we believe common to the whole genus.</P>
<P>This &s;pecies frequents many of our coa&s;ts, but particularly tho&s;e of <HI>Cornwall</HI> during the pilchard &s;ea&s;on, and is at that time taken with great iron hooks made on purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>It is of an oblong form: <NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;cr.</NOTE> the no&s;e extends far beyond the mouth: it wants the orifices behind the eyes, which are u&s;ual in this genus: the no&s;trils are long, and placed tran&s;ver&s;ely. <HI>Artedi</HI> remarks a triangular dent in the lower part of the back.</P>
<P>The &s;kin is &s;moother than that of other &s;harks; the back is of a fine blue color; the belly of a &s;il|very white.</P>
<P><HI>Linnoeus</HI> &s;ays, that its teeth are granulated; for our part we mu&s;t confe&s;s it is a fi&s;h that has not come under our examination, therefore hope to be fa|vored with an accurate de&s;cription from &s;ome Natu|li&s;t, who lives on the coa&s;t it haunts.</P>
<P>We may add, that <HI>Rondeletius</HI> &s;ays he was an eye|witne&s;s to its fondne&s;s for human fle&s;h; that the&s;e fi&s;h are le&s;s de&s;tructive in our &s;eas, is owing to the coolne&s;s of the climate, which is well known to abate the fiercene&s;s of &s;ome, as well as the venom of other animals.</P>

<P>The no&s;e was &s;hort, and very blunt, not extend|ing above an inch and an half beyond the mouth. The no&s;trils were large, placed near the mouth, and covered with a large angular flap: the head very flat.</P>

<P>Both the back fins were placed much behind, and nearer the tail than in common.</P>
<P>The tail was finned, and below extended into a &s;harp angle.</P>
<P>The color of the whole upper part of the body, and the fins, was brown, marked with numbers of large di&s;tinct black &s;pots: &s;ome parts of the &s;kin were tinged with red; the belly was white.</P>

<P>THAT this is the <GAP DESC="foreign"> of <HI>Dorion,</HI> as quoted by <HI>Athenaeus,</HI> is very probable, as well from the account he gives of its form, as of its nature. He &s;ays its mouth is always open, with which it agrees with the &s;turgeon, and that it conceals it&s;elf in the hot months: this &s;hews it to be a fi&s;h of a cold nature, which is confirmed by the hi&s;tory of
<PB N="97" REF="115">the <HI>European</HI> fi&s;h of this &s;pecies, given by Mr. <HI>For&s;ter</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil.

<P>Whether the <HI>acipen&s;er</HI> is the &s;turgeon of the mo|derns, may be doubted, otherwi&s;e <HI>Ovid</HI> would ne|ver have &s;poke of it as a foreign fi&s;h:

<L>And, thou, a fi&s;h in foreign &s;eas renowned.</L></Q></P>
<P>It being well known that it is not uncommon in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> and even in the mouth of the <HI>Tiber,</HI> at certain &s;ea&s;ons; but this pa&s;&s;age leaves us as much in the dark as to the particular &s;pecies in|tended, by the word <HI>acipen&s;er,</HI> as the de&s;cription <HI>Pliny</HI> has given us; for that philo&s;opher relates, that its &s;cales are placed in a contrary direction to tho&s;e of other fi&s;h, being turned towards the mouth, which di&s;agrees with the character of all that are known at pre&s;ent. Whatever fi&s;h it might be, it was cer|tainly the &s;ame with the <HI>Elops,</HI> or <HI>Helops,</HI> as appears both from <HI>Pliny,</HI> and another line of the poet be|fore-mentioned:

<P>The &s;turgeon annually a&s;cends our rivers, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Migra|tory.</NOTE> but in no great numbers, and is taken by accident in the
<PB N="98" REF="116">&s;almon nets. It &s;eems a &s;piritle&s;s fi&s;h, making no manner of re&s;i&s;tance when entangled, but is drawn out of the water like a lifele&s;s lump. It is a fi&s;h that is &s;eldom taken far out at &s;ea, but frequents &s;uch parts as are not remote from the ae&s;tuaries of great rivers. It is admired for the delicacy and firmne&s;s of its fle&s;h, which is white as veal, and extremely good when roa&s;ted. It is generally pickled. The mo&s;t we receive comes either from the <HI>Baltic</HI> rivers, or <HI>North America:</HI> tho&s;e cured at <HI>Pillau</HI> have been, till of late, in the greate&s;t repute; but thro' the encou|ragement given by the &s;ociety in&s;tituted for pro|moting trade and manufactures, the &s;turgeon from our colonies begins to rival tho&s;e of the <HI>Baltic.</HI></P>
<P>Great numbers are taken during &s;ummer in the lakes <HI>Fri&s;che-haff,</HI> and <HI>Curi&s;ch-haff</HI> near <HI>Pillau,</HI> in large nets made of &s;mall cord.

<P>The no&s;e is very long, &s;lender, and ends in a point. The eyes are extremely &s;mall; the no&s;trils placed near them: on the lower part of the no&s;e are four cirri or beards: the mouth is &s;ituated far be|neath, is &s;mall, and un&s;upported by any jaw bones; neither has it any teeth.</P>
<P>The body is long, pentagonal, and covered with five rows of large bony tubercles: one row of which is placed on the back, and two on each &s;ide. The whole under &s;ide of the fi&s;h, from the end of

<P>The upper part of the body is of a dirty olive color: the lower part &s;ilvery; the middle of the tubercles white.</P>

<P>THIS &s;ingular fi&s;h encrea&s;es to the weight of four pounds, and the length of &s;ixteen inches: the &s;hape of the body is like that of the bream, deep but very thick, and it &s;wims edgeways. The back is &s;harp and elevated, the belly flat.</P>
<P>The irides are of a cherry color; lips, mouth, <NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;cr.</NOTE> and tongue, of a deeper red: the jaws lined with innumerable &s;mall teeth; the tongue very thick; along the ridge of the back is a row of large bony tubercles; from above the eye to within a &s;mall &s;pace of the tail is another row; beneath that a third, commencing at the gills; and on each &s;ide the belly a fourth row, con&s;i&s;ting of five tubercles like the other: the whole &s;kin is rough, with &s;mall tu|bercles.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="122">On the lower part of the back is a thick knob, improperly called a fin, being de&s;titute of &s;pines; beneath that is the dor&s;al fin, of a browni&s;h hue, reaching within an inch of the tail: on the belly, ju&s;t oppo&s;ite, is another of the &s;ame form. The belly is of a bright crim&s;on color: the pectoral fins are large and broad, almo&s;t uniting at their ba&s;e. Beneath the&s;e is the part by which it adheres to the rocks, &amp;c. It con&s;i&s;ts of an oval aperture, &s;ur|rounded with a fle&s;hy mu&s;cular and obtu&s;e &s;oft &s;ub|&s;tance, edged with &s;mall threaded appendages, which concur as &s;o many cla&s;pers: tail and vent fins purple.</P>
<P>By means of this part it adheres with va&s;t force to any thing it plea&s;es. As a proof of its tenacity we have known, that on flinging a fi&s;h of this &s;pe|cies ju&s;t caught, into a pail of water, it fixed it&s;elf &s;o firmly to the bottom, that on taking the fi&s;h by the tail, the whole pail by that means was lifted, tho' it held &s;ome gallons, and that without removing the fi&s;h from its hold.</P>

<P>THE little pipe fi&s;h &s;eldom exceeds five inches in length, is very &s;lender, and tapers off to a point. It wants both the pectoral and tail fins; is covered with a &s;mooth &s;kin, not with a cru&s;t as the two former kinds are.</P>
<P>The no&s;e is &s;hort and turns a little up; the eyes prominent.</P>

<P>THE eel is a very &s;ingular fi&s;h in &s;everal things that relate to its natural hi&s;tory, and in &s;ome re&s;pects borders on the nature of the reptile tribe.</P>
<P>It is known to quit its element, and during night to wander along the meadows, not only for
<PB N="112" REF="131">change of habitation, but al&s;o that the &s;ake of prey, feeding on the &s;nails it finds in its pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>During winter it beds it&s;elf deep in the mud, and continues in a &s;tate of re&s;t like the &s;erpent kind. It is very impatient of cold, and will eagerly take &s;helter in a whi&s;p of &s;traw flung into a pond in &s;e|vere weather, which has &s;ometimes been practi&s;ed as a method of taking them. <HI>Albertus</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ge&s;ner pi&s;c. <HI>45.</HI></NOTE> goes &s;o far as to &s;ay, that he has known eels to take &s;helter in a hay-rick, yet all peri&s;hed thro' exce&s;s of cold.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved, that in the river <HI>Nyne</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot"><HI>Morton</HI>'s <HI>Hi&s;t. Northampt.</HI> 419. <HI>Pliny</HI> ob&s;erves, that the eels of the lake <HI>Benacus</HI> collect together in the &s;ame manner in the month of <HI>October,</HI> po&s;&s;ibly to retreat from the winter's cold. <HI>lib.</HI> ix. <HI>c.</HI> 22.</NOTE> there is a variety of &s;mall eel, with a le&s;&s;er head and narrower mouth than the mommon kind, that is found in clus;ters in the bottom of the river, and is called the <HI>Bed-eel:</HI> the&s;e are &s;ometimes rouzed up by violent floods, and are never found at that time with meat in their &s;tomachs. This bears &s;uch an analogy with the clu&s;tering of blindworms in their quie&s;cent &s;tate, that we cannot but con&s;ider it as a further proof of a partial agreement in the nature of the two genera.</P>
<P>The antients adopted a mo&s;t wild opinion about the generation of the&s;e fi&s;h, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Genera|tion.</NOTE> believing them to be either created from the mud, or that the &s;crapings of their bodies which they left on the &s;tones, were animated and became young eels. Some moderns gave into the&s;e opinions, and into others that were equally extravagant. They could not account for
<PB N="113" REF="132">the appearance of the&s;e fi&s;h in ponds that never were &s;tocked with them, and that were even &s;o remote as to make their being met with in &s;uch places a phae|nomenon that they could not &s;olve. But there is much rea&s;on to believe, that many waters are &s;up|plied with the&s;e fi&s;h by the aquatic fowl of prey, in the &s;ame manner as vegetation is &s;pread by many of the land birds, either by being dropped as they carry them to feed their young, or by pa&s;&s;ing quick thro' their bodies, as is the ca&s;e with herons; and &s;uch may be occa&s;ion of the appearance of the&s;e fi&s;h in places where they were never &s;een before. As to their immediate generation, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Vivipa|rous.</NOTE> it has been &s;ufficiently proved to be effected in the ordinary cour&s;e of na|ture, and that they are viviparous.</P>
<P>They are extremely voracious, and very de&s;truc|tive to the fry of fi&s;h.</P>
<P>No fi&s;h lives &s;o long out of water as the eel: it is extremely tenacious of life, as its parts will move a con&s;iderable time after they are flayed and cut into pieces.</P>
<P>The eel is placed by <HI>Linnaeus</HI> in the genus of <HI>Mu|raena,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;cr.</NOTE> his fir&s;t of the apodal fi&s;h, or &s;uch which want the ventral fins.</P>
<P>The eyes are placed not remote from the end of the no&s;e: the irides are tinged with red: the under jaw is longer than the upper: the teeth are &s;mall, &s;harp, and numerous: beneath each eye is a minute orifice: at the end of the no&s;e two others, &s;mall and tubular.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="133">This fi&s;h is furni&s;hed with a pair of pectoral fins, rounded at their ends. Another narrow fin on the back, uniting with that of the tail; and the anal fin joins it in the &s;ame manner beneath.</P>
<P>Behind the pectoral fins is the orifice to the gills, which are concealed in the &s;kin.</P>
<P>Eels vary much in their colors, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Silver Eels.</NOTE> from a &s;ooty hue to a light olive green; and tho&s;e which are called &s;ilver eels, have their bellies white, and a remarka|ble clearne&s;s throughout.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e there is another variety of this fi&s;h known in the <HI>Thames</HI> by the name of <HI>Grigs,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Grigs.</NOTE> and about <HI>Oxford</HI> by that of <HI>Grigs</HI> or <HI>Gluts.</HI> The&s;e are &s;carce ever &s;een near <HI>Oxford</HI> in the winter, but ap|pear in &s;pring, and bite readily at the hook, which common eels in that neighborhood will not. They have a larger head, a blunter no&s;e, thicker &s;kin, and Je&s;s fat than the common &s;ort; neither are they &s;o much e&s;teemed, nor do they often exceed three or four pounds in weight.</P>
<P>Common eels grow to a large &s;ize, &s;ometimes &s;o great as to weigh fifteen or twenty pounds, but that is extremely rare. As to in&s;tances brought by <HI>Dale</HI> and others, of the&s;e fi&s;h encrea&s;ing to a &s;uperior magnitude, we have much rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect them to have been congers, &s;ince the enormous fi&s;h they de&s;cribe, have all been taken at the mouths of the <HI>Thames</HI> or <HI>Medway.</HI></P>
<P>The eel is the mo&s;t univer&s;al of fi&s;h, yet is &s;carce ever found in the <HI>Danube,</HI> tho' it is very common in the lakes and rivers of <HI>Upper Au&s;tria.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="134">The <HI>Romans</HI> held this fi&s;h very cheap, probably from its likene&s;s to a &s;nake:

</LIST></P>
<P>As to the di&s;tinction that Mr. <HI>Ray,</HI> and other writers, make of the &s;mall beards at the end of the no&s;e, we think it not to be depended on, being &s;ometimes found in both kinds, and &s;ometimes en|tirely wanting.</P>
<P>We believe they generate like the fre&s;h-water &s;pecies: innumerable quantities, of what are &s;up|po&s;ed to be their fry, come up the <HI>Severn</HI> about the month of <HI>April,</HI> preceding the <HI>Shads,</HI> which it is conjectured migrate into that river to feed on them: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Elvers.</NOTE> they are called <HI>Elvers.</HI> They quite &s;warm during their &s;ea&s;on, and are taken in a kind of &s;ieve made of hair-cloth, fixed to a long pole; the fi&s;h|erman &s;tanding on the edge of the water during the tide, puts in his net as far as he can reach, and draw|ing it out again takes multitudes at every &s;weep, and will take as many during one tide as will fill a bu&s;hel. They are dre&s;&s;ed, and reckoned very deli|cate.</P>
<P>Congers are extremely voracious, preying on other fi&s;h, and on crabs at the time they have lo&s;t their &s;hell, and are in a &s;oft &s;tate. They and eels in ge|neral are al&s;o particularly fond of carca&s;&s;es of any

<P>THIS fi&s;h &s;eems to be confined to the northern parts of the globe. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Place.</NOTE> We find it in the &s;eas of <HI>Greenland,</HI> in tho&s;e of <HI>Iceland</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Where it is called <HI>Steinbei&s;&s;er.

<P>It is a mo&s;t ravenous and fierce fi&s;h, and when taken fa&s;tens on any thing within its reach: the fi&s;hermen dreading its bite, endeavor as &s;oon as po&s;&s;i|ble
<PB N="120" REF="140">to beat out its fore teeth, and then kill it by &s;triking it behind the head. <HI>Schonevelde</HI> relates, that its bite is &s;o hard that it will &s;eize on an anchor, and leave the marks of its teeth in it; and the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> and <HI>German</HI> names of <HI>Steenbider</HI> and <HI>Steinbei&s;&s;er,</HI> ex|pre&s;s the &s;en&s;e of its great &s;trength, as if it was ca|pable of cru&s;hing even &s;tones with its jaws.</P>
<P>It feeds almo&s;t entirely on cru&s;taceous animals, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Food.</NOTE> and &s;hell fi&s;h, &s;uch as crabs, lob&s;ters, prawns, mu&s;|cles, &s;collops, large whelks, &amp;c. the&s;e it grinds to pieces with its teeth, and &s;wallows with the le&s;&s;er &s;hells. It does not appear they are di&s;&s;olved in the &s;tomach, but are voided with the foeces, for which purpo&s;e the aperture of the anus is wider than in other fi&s;h of the &s;ame &s;ize.</P>
<P>It is full of roe in <HI>February, March,</HI> and <HI>April,</HI> and &s;pawns in <HI>May</HI> and <HI>June.</HI></P>
<P>This fi&s;h has &s;o di&s;agreeable and horrid an ap|pearance, that nobody at <HI>Scarborough</HI> except the fi&s;hermen will eat it, and they prefer it to holibut. They always before dre&s;&s;ing take off the head and &s;kin.</P>
<P>The &s;ea wolf grows to a large &s;ize: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Size.</NOTE> tho&s;e on the <HI>York&s;hire</HI> coa&s;t are &s;ometimes found of the length of four feet, and, according to Doctor <HI>Gronovius,</HI> have been taken near <HI>Hitland</HI> &s;even feet long, and even more. That which we examined was three feet two inches and an half from the tip of the no&s;e to the end of the tail: the length of the head was eight inches, from the gills to the vent, ten; from thence to the tip of the tail, twenty and one half.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="141">The circumference of the head was &s;eventeen inches, at the &s;houlders twenty, but near the tail only four and a half.</P>
<P>Its weight was twenty pounds and a quarter.</P>
<P>The head is a little &s;latted on the top: the no&s;e blunt; the no&s;trils very &s;mall; the eyes &s;mall, and placed near the end of the no&s;e.</P>
<P>The teeth are very remarkable, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Teeth.</NOTE> and finely adapted to its way of life. The fore teeth are &s;trong, coni|cal, diverging a little from each other, &s;tand far out of the jaws, and are commonly &s;ix above, and the &s;ame below, tho' &s;ometimes there are only five in each jaw: the&s;e are &s;upported within-&s;ide by a row of le&s;&s;er teeth, which makes the number in the up|per jaw &s;eventeen or eighteen, in the lower eleven or twelve.</P>
<P>The &s;ides of the under jaw are convex inwards, which greatly adds to their &s;trength, and at the &s;ame time allows room for the large mu&s;cles with which the head of this fi&s;h is furni&s;hed.</P>
<P>The <HI>dentes molares,</HI> or grinding teeth of the under jaw, are higher on the outer than the inner edges, which inclines their &s;urfaces inward: they join to the canine teeth in that jaw, but in the upper are &s;e|parate from them.</P>
<P>In the centre are two rows of flat &s;trong teeth, fixed on an oblong ba&s;is upon the bones of the pa|late and no&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e and the other grinding teeth are often found fo&s;&s;il, and in that &s;tate called <HI>Bufonites,</HI> or <HI>Toad|&s;tones:</HI> they were formerly much e&s;teemed for their

<P>THIS fi&s;h is found only in the northern part of the world; it is, as <HI>Rondeletius</HI> calls it, an ocean fi&s;h, and never met with in the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> &s;ea. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">None (&s;ays Captain <HI>Arm&s;trong</HI> in his Hi&s;tory of <HI>Minorca</HI>) of the <HI>A&s;elli</HI> or cod fi&s;h kind, frequent our &s;hores, <HI>p.</HI> 163.</NOTE>.

<P>This locality of &s;ituation is common to many other &s;pecies of this genus, mo&s;t of them being in|habitants of the cold &s;eas, or &s;uch that lie within zones that can ju&s;t clame the title of temperate.

<P>The great rendezvouz of the cod fi&s;h is on the Banks of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> and the other &s;and banks that lie off the coa&s;ts of <HI>Cape Breton, Nova Scotia,</HI> and <HI>New England.</HI> They prefer tho&s;e &s;ituations, by rea&s;on of the quantity of worms produced in tho&s;e &s;andy bottoms, which tempt them to re&s;ort there for food: but another cau&s;e of the particular attach|ment the fi&s;h have to the&s;e &s;pots, is their vicinity to the polar &s;eas, where they return to &s;pawn; there they depo&s;e their roes in full &s;ecurity, but want of food forces them, as &s;oon as the fir&s;t more &s;outhern &s;eas are open, to repair thither for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>Few are taken north of <HI>Iceland,</HI> but on the &s;outh and we&s;t coa&s;ts they abound: they are again found to &s;warm on the coa&s;ts of <HI>Norway,</HI> in the <HI>Baltic,</HI> off the <HI>Orkney</HI> and the <HI>We&s;tern I&s;les;</HI> after which their

<P>Before the di&s;covery of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> the greater fi&s;heries of cod were in the &s;eas of <HI>Iceland,</HI> and of our <HI>We&s;tern I&s;les,</HI> which were the grand re&s;ort of &s;hips of all the commercial nations; but it &s;eems that the greate&s;t plenty was met with near <HI>Iceland;</HI> for we find Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> conde&s;cending to a&s;k permi&s;&s;ion to fi&s;h in tho&s;e &s;eas from <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> the IVth. of <HI>Denmark,</HI> yet afterwards &s;he &s;o far repent|ed her reque&s;t, as to in&s;truct her emba&s;&s;adors to that court, to in&s;i&s;t on the right of a free and univer&s;al fi&s;hery <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rymer</HI>'s <HI>Foed.</HI> xvi. 275, 425.</NOTE></P>

<PB N="140" REF="162">early as 1536; and we think we have &s;omewhere read, that their fir&s;t pretence for fi&s;hing for cod in tho&s;e &s;eas, was only to &s;upply an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> convent with that article.</P>
<P>The encrea&s;e of &s;hipping that re&s;ort to tho&s;e fer|tile banks, are now un&s;peakable: our own country &s;till enjoys the greate&s;t &s;hare, which ought to be e&s;|teemed our chiefe&s;t trea&s;ure, as it brings wealth to individuals, and &s;trength to the &s;tate.</P>
<P>All this immen&s;e fi&s;hery is carried on by the hook and line only <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We have been informed that they fi&s;h in the depth of from fifteen to &s;ixty fathoms, according to the inequality of the <HI>Bank,</HI> which is repre&s;ented as a va&s;t mountain under water above five hundred miles long, and near three hundred broad, and that &s;eamen knew when they approach it by the great &s;well of the &s;ea, and the thick mi&s;ts that impend over it.</NOTE>; the bait is herring, a &s;mall fi&s;h called a <HI>Capelin,</HI> a &s;hell fi&s;h called <HI>Clams,</HI> and bits of &s;ea fowl; and with the&s;e are caught fi&s;h &s;ufficient to find employ for near fifteen thou&s;and <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;eamen, and to afford &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to a much more numerous body of people at home, who are engaged in the various manufactures which &s;o va&s;t a fi&s;hery demands.</P>
<P>The food of the cod is either &s;mall fi&s;h, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Food.</NOTE> worms, te&s;taceous, or cru&s;taceous animals, &s;uch as crabs, large whelks, &amp;c. and their dige&s;tion is &s;o powerful, as to di&s;&s;olve the greate&s;t part of the &s;hells they &s;wallow. They are very voracious, and catch at any &s;mall body they perceive moved by the water, even &s;tones and pebbles, which are often found in their &s;tomachs.</P>
<P>Providence hath kindly ordained that this fi&s;h, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Va&s;tly prolific.</NOTE> &s;o u&s;eful to mankind, &s;hould be &s;o very prolific as to
<PB N="141" REF="163">&s;upply more than the deficiencies of the multitudes annually taken. <HI>Leuwenhoek</HI> counted nine millions three hundred and eighty-four thou&s;and eggs in a cod fi&s;h of a middling &s;ize, a number &s;ure that will baffle all the efforts of man, or the voracity of the inhabitants of the ocean to exterminate, and which will &s;ecure to all ages an inexhau&s;tible &s;upply of grateful provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>In our &s;eas they begin to &s;pawn in <HI>January,</HI> and depo&s;ite their eggs in rough ground, among rocks. Some continue in roe till the beginning of <HI>April.</HI> The cod fi&s;h in general recover quicker after &s;pawn|ing than any other fi&s;h, therefore it is common to take &s;ome good ones all the &s;ummer. When they are out of s;ea&s;on they are thin tailed and lou&s;y, and the lice chiefly fix them&s;elves on the in&s;ide of their mouths.</P>
<P>The fi&s;h of a middling &s;ize are mo&s;t e&s;teemed for the table, and are cho&s;en by their plumpne&s;s and roundne&s;s, e&s;pecially near the tail, by the depth of the &s;ulcus or pit behind the head, and by the regular undulated appearance of the &s;ides, as if they were ribbed. The glutinous parts about the head lo&s;e their delicate flavor after it has been twenty-four hours out of the water, even in winter, in which the&s;e and other fi&s;h of this genus are in highe&s;t &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>The large&s;t that we ever heard of taken on our coa&s;ts weighed &s;ixty-nine pounds, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Size.</NOTE> but the general weight on the <HI>York&s;hire</HI> &s;eas is from fourteen to forty.</P>

<P><PB N="142" REF="164">The jaws are of an equal length, at the end of the lower is a &s;mall beard; the teeth are di&s;po&s;ed in the palate as well as jaws.</P>
<P>The eyes are large.</P>
<P>On the back are three &s;oft fins; the fir&s;t has four|teen, the two la&s;t nineteen rays a-piece.

<P>The&s;e fi&s;h are common on mo&s;t of our rocky and deep coa&s;ts, but particularly tho&s;e of the north of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>The young begin to appear on the <HI>York&s;hire</HI> coa&s;t the beginning of <HI>July</HI> in va&s;t &s;hoals, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Young.</NOTE> and are at that time about an inch and an half long.

Fi&s;h of that age are from eight to fif|teen inches long, and begin to have a little black|ne&s;s
<PB N="153" REF="176">near the gills, and on the back, and the black|ne&s;s encrea&s;es as they grow older.</P>
<P>The fry is known by different names in different places: they are called at <HI>Scarborough Parrs,</HI> and when a year old, <HI>Billets.</HI> About nine or ten years ago &s;uch a glut of <HI>Parrs</HI> vi&s;ited that part, that for &s;everal weeks it was impo&s;&s;ible to dip a pail into the &s;ea without taking &s;ome.</P>
<P>Tho' this fi&s;h is &s;o little e&s;teemed when fre&s;h, yet it is &s;alted and dried for &s;ale; a per&s;on la&s;t year hav|ing cured above a thou&s;and at <HI>Scarborough.</HI></P>
<P>The coal fi&s;h is of more elegant form than the cod fi&s;h: <NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;cr.</NOTE> they generally grow to the length of two feet and an half, and weigh about twenty-eight or thirty pounds at mo&s;t.

He calls it the <HI>Whiff,</HI> and &s;ays its mouth is large, its &s;kin hard and rough, its color a dirty a&s;h, and its fle&s;h coar&s;e and good for nothing. The &s;kin ap|pears to be much &s;potted, and the lateral line greatly incurvated at the beginning, and afterwards pro|ceeding in a &s;trait direction to the tail.</P>

<P>TURBOTS grow to a very large &s;ize; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Size.</NOTE> we have &s;een them of three and twenty pounds weight, but have heard of &s;ome that weighed thirty. They are taken chiefly off the north coa&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> and others off the <HI>Dutch</HI> coa&s;t; but we believe the la&s;t has, in many in&s;tances, more credit than it de|&s;erves for the abundance of its fi&s;h.</P>
<P>The large turbots, and &s;everal other kinds of flat fi&s;h, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fi&s;hery.</NOTE> are taken by the hook and line, for they lye in deep water: the method of taking them in wares, or &s;taked nets, is too precarious to be de|pended on for the &s;upply of our great markets, be|cau&s;e it is by meer accident that the great fi&s;h &s;tray into them.</P>
<P>It is a misfortune to the inhabitants of many of our fi&s;hing coa&s;ts, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the north part of <HI>North Wales,</HI> that they are unacquainted with the
<PB N="193" REF="218">mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful means of capture: for their benefit, and perhaps that of other parts of our i&s;land, we &s;hall lay before them the method practi&s;ed by the fi&s;hermen of <HI>Scarborough,</HI> as it was communicated to us by Mr. <HI>Travis.</HI></P>
<P>When they go out to fi&s;h, each per&s;on is provided with three lines. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lines.</NOTE> Each man's lines are fairly coiled upon a flat oblong piece of wicker-work; the hooks being baited, and placed very regularly in the centre of the coil. Each line is furni&s;hed with 14 &s;core of hooks, at the di&s;tance of &s;ix feet two inches from each other. The hooks are fa&s;tened to the lines upon &s;neads of twi&s;ted hor&s;e-hair, 27 inches in length.</P>
<P>When fi&s;hing there are always three men in each coble, and con&s;equently nine of the&s;e lines are fa&s;|tened together, and u&s;ed as one line, extending in length near three miles, and furni&s;hed with 2520 hooks. An anchor and a buoy are fixed at the fir&s;t end of the line, and one more of each at the end of each man's lines; in all four anchors, which are commonly perforated &s;tones, and four buoys made of leather or cork. The line is always laid acro&s;s the current. The tides of flood and ebb continue an equal time upon our coa&s;t, and when undi&s;turbed by winds run each way about &s;ix hours. They are &s;o rapid that the fi&s;hermen can only &s;hoot and haul their lines at the turn of tide; and therefore the lines always remain upon the ground about &s;ix hours <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this &s;pace the <HI>myxine glutino&s;a</HI> of <HI>Linnaeus,</HI> will frequently penetrate the fi&s;h that are on the hooks, and entirely devour them, leaving only the &s;kin and bones.</NOTE>. The &s;ame rapidity of tide prevents their u&s;ing hand|lines;
<PB N="194" REF="219">and therefore two of the people commonly wrap them&s;elves in the &s;ail, and &s;leep while the other keeps a &s;trict look-out, for fear of being run down by &s;hips, and to ob&s;erve the weather. For &s;torms often ri&s;e &s;o &s;uddenly, that it is with extreme difti|culty they can &s;ometimes e&s;cape to the &s;hore, leav|ing their lines behind.</P>
<P>The coble is 20 feet 6 inches long, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Coble.</NOTE> and 5 feet ex|treme breadth. It is about one ton burthen, rowed with three pair of oars, and admirably con&s;tructed for the purpo&s;e of encountering a mountanous &s;ea: they hoi&s;t &s;ail when the wind &s;uits.</P>
<P>The five-men boat is 40 feet long and 15 broad, and of 25 tons burthen: it is &s;o called, tho' navigated by &s;ix men and a boy, becau&s;e one of the men is commonly hired to cook, &amp;c. and does not &s;hare in the profits with the other five. All our able fi&s;her|men go in the&s;e boats to the herring fi&s;hery at <HI>Yar|mouth</HI> the latter end of <HI>September,</HI> and return about the middle of <HI>November.</HI> The boats are then laid up until the beginning of <HI>Lent,</HI> at which time they go off in them to the edge of the <HI>Dogger,</HI> and other places, to fi&s;h for turbot, cod, ling, &s;kates, &amp;c. They always take two cobles on board, and when they come upon their ground, anchor the boat, throw out the cobles, and fi&s;h in the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e do who go from the &s;hore in a coble, with this dif|ference only; that here each man is provided with double the quantity of lines, and in&s;tead of wait|ing the return of tide in the coble, return to the boat and bait their other lines; thus hawling one &s;et, and &s;hooting another every turn of tide. They
<PB N="195" REF="220">commonly run into harbour twice a week to deliver their fi&s;h. The five-men boat is decked at each end, but open in the middle, and has two large lug-&s;ails.</P>
<P>The be&s;t bait for all kinds of fi&s;h is fre&s;h herring cut in pieces of a proper &s;ize; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bait.</NOTE> and notwith&s;tanding what has been &s;aid to the contrary, they are taken here at any time in the winter, and all the &s;pring, whenever the fi&s;hermen put down their nets for that purpo&s;e.

The hooks u&s;ed here are much &s;maller than tho&s;e em|ployed at <HI>Iceland</HI> and <HI>Newfoundland.</HI> Experience has &s;hewn that the larger fi&s;h will take a living &s;mall one upon the hook, &s;ooner than any bait that can be put on; therefore they u&s;e &s;uch as the &s;mall fi&s;h can &s;wallow.

This may be true in re&s;pect to large fi&s;h; but it is well known the &s;mall ones are the mo&s;t tempting bait that can be laid for the pike.</P>
<P>The perch is a fi&s;h very tenacious of life: we have known them carried near &s;ixty miles in dry &s;traw, and yet &s;urvive the journey.</P>
<P>The&s;e fi&s;h &s;eldom grow to a large &s;ize: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Size.</NOTE> we once heard of one that was taken in the <HI>Serpentine</HI> river, <HI>Hyde-Park,</HI> that weighed nine pounds, but that is very uncommon.</P>
<P>The body is deep: <NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;cr.</NOTE> the &s;cales very rough: the back much arched.</P>
<P>The irides golden: the teeth &s;mall, di&s;po&s;ed in the jaws and on the roof of the mouth: the edges of the covers of the gills &s;errated: on the lower end of the large&s;t is a &s;harp &s;pine.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t dor&s;al fin con&s;i&s;ts of fourteen &s;trong &s;piny rays; the &s;econd of &s;ixteen &s;oft ones: the pec|toral fins are tran&s;parent, and con&s;i&s;t of fourteen rays; the ventral of &s;ix; the anal of eleven.</P>
<P>The tail is a little forked.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="239">The colors are beautiful: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Color.</NOTE> the back and part of the &s;ides being of a deep green, marked with five broad black bars pointing downwards: the belly is white, tinged with red: the ventral fins of a rich &s;carlet; the anal fins and tail of the &s;ame color, but rather paler.</P>
<P>In a lake called <HI>Llyn Raithlyn,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Crooked Perch.</NOTE> in <HI>Merioneth&s;hire,</HI> is a very &s;ingular variety of perch: the back is quite hunched, and the lower part of the back bone, next the tail, &s;trangely di&s;torted: in color, and in other re&s;pects, it re&s;embles the common kind, which are as numerous in the lake as the&s;e deformed fi&s;h.

<P>THE mackrel is a &s;ummer fi&s;h of pa&s;&s;age that vi&s;its our &s;hores in va&s;t &s;hoals.

<P>This fi&s;h is ea&s;ily taken by a bait, but the be&s;t time is during a fre&s;h gale of wind, which is thence called a <HI>mackrel</HI> gale.</P>
<P>It is not often that it exceeds two pounds in weight, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Size.</NOTE> yet we heard that there was one &s;old la&s;t &s;ummer in <HI>London</HI> that weighed five and a quarter.</P>
<P>The no&s;e is taper and &s;harp pointed: <NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;cr.</NOTE> the eyes large: the jaws of an equal length: the teeth &s;mall, but numerous.</P>
<P>The form of this fi&s;h is very elegant.</P>
<P>The body is a little compre&s;&s;ed on the &s;ides: to|wards the tail it grows very &s;lender, and a little an|gular.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t dor&s;al fin is placed a little behind the pec|toral fin, is triangular, and con&s;i&s;ts of nine or ten &s;tiff rays; the &s;econd lies at a di&s;tance from the other, and has twelve &s;oft rays; the pectoral twenty; the ventral &s;ix: at the ba&s;e of the anal fin is a &s;trong &s;pine.</P>
<P>Between the la&s;t dor&s;al fin and the tail, are five &s;mall fins, and the &s;ame number between the anal fin and the tail.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="249">The tail is broad and &s;emilunar: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Color.</NOTE> The color of the back and &s;ides above the lateral line, is a fine green, varied with blue, marked with black lines, pointing downwards; beneath the line the &s;ides and belly are of a &s;ilvery color.</P>

<P>Other particulars relating to the natural hi&s;tory of this fi&s;h, we &s;hall relate in our accounts of the fi&s;heries, either from our own ob&s;ervations, or from &s;uch as have been communicated to us from different places: the fulle&s;t we have been favored with is from Mr. <HI>Potts,</HI> of <HI>Berwick,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tweed</HI> fi&s;hery.</NOTE> to whom the publick is indebted for the following very curious hi&s;tory of the &s;almon fi&s;hery on the <HI>Tweed.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="270">At the latter end of the year, or in the month of <HI>November,</HI> the &s;almon begin to pre&s;s up the rivers as far as they can reach, in order to &s;pawn; when that time approaches they &s;earch for a place fit for the purpo&s;e: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Spawn|ing.</NOTE> the male and female unite in forming a proper receptacle for it in the &s;and or gravel, about the depth of eighteen inches; in this the female de|po&s;its her &s;pawn, the male his milt, which they cover carefully, as it is &s;aid, with their tails, for after &s;pawning they are ob&s;erved to have no &s;kin on that part.</P>
<P>The &s;pawn lies buried till &s;pring, if not di&s;turbed by violent floods; but the &s;almon ha&s;ten to &s;ea as &s;oon as they are able, to purify and clean&s;e them|&s;elves, and to recover their &s;trength; for after &s;pawn|ing they become very poor and lean, and then are called <HI>Kipper.</HI></P>
<P>About the latter end of <HI>March</HI> the &s;pawn begins to exclude the young, which gradually increa&s;e to the length of four or five inches, and are then termed <HI>Smelts</HI> or <HI>Smouts:</HI> about the beginning of <HI>May</HI> the river is full of them; it &s;eems to be all alive; there is no having an idea of the numbers without &s;eeing them; but a &s;ea&s;onable flood then hurries them all to the &s;ea, &s;carce any or very few being left in the river.</P>
<P>About the middle of <HI>June</HI> the earlie&s;t of the fry begin to drop, as it were, into the river again from the &s;ea, at that time about twelve, fourteen, or &s;ix|teen inches, and by a gradual progre&s;s, increa&s;e in number and &s;ize till about the end of <HI>July,</HI> which is at <HI>Berwick</HI> termed the height of <HI>Gil&s;e</HI> time, the
<PB N="243" REF="271">name given to the fi&s;h at that age: the end of <HI>July,</HI> or beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> they le&s;&s;en in number, but encrea&s;e in &s;ize, &s;ome being &s;ix, &s;even, eight, or nine pounds in weight; this appears to be a &s;urpri|&s;ing quick growth, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Quick growth.</NOTE> yet we have received from a gen|tleman at <HI>Warrington,</HI> an in&s;tance &s;till more &s;o: a kipper &s;almon weighing 7lb. three quarters, taken on the 7th of <HI>February,</HI> being marked with a &s;ci&s;&s;ars on the back, fin, and tail, and turned into the river, was again taken the 17th of <HI>March</HI> following, and then was found to weigh 17lb. and a half.</P>
<P>The capture in the <HI>Tweed,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Capture.</NOTE> about the month of <HI>July,</HI> is prodigious; in a good fi&s;hery, often a boat load, and &s;ometimes near two, are taken in a tide: &s;ome few years ago there were above &s;even hundred fi&s;h taken at one hawl, but from fifty to a hundred is very frequent: the coopers in <HI>Berwick</HI> then begin to &s;alt both <HI>Salmon</HI> and <HI>Gil&s;es</HI> in pipes, and other large ve&s;&s;els, and afterwards barrel <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;almon barrel holds above forty-two gallons, wine mea&s;ure.</NOTE> them to &s;end abroad, having then far more than the <HI>London</HI> markets can take off their hands.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the &s;almon taken before <HI>April,</HI> or to the &s;etting in of the warm weather, is &s;ent fre&s;h to <HI>Lon|don</HI> in ba&s;kets, unle&s;s now and then the ve&s;&s;el is di&s;|appointed by contrary winds, of &s;ailing immediately; in that ca&s;e the fi&s;h is brought a&s;hore again to the coopers offices, and boiled, pickled, and kitted, and &s;ent to the <HI>London</HI> markets by the &s;ame &s;hip, and fre&s;h &s;almon put in the ba&s;kets in lieu of the &s;tale ones. At the beginning of the &s;ea&s;on, when a &s;hip
<PB N="244" REF="272">is on the point of &s;ailing, a fre&s;h clean &s;almon will &s;ell from a &s;hilling to eighteen pence a pound, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Price.</NOTE> and mo&s;t of the time that this part of the trade is carried on, the prices are from five to nine &s;hillings per &s;tone, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;tone of &s;almon weighs 18lb. 100z. &frac12;, or in other terms, four &s;tones, or fifty-&s;ix pounds avoirdupoi&s;e, is only three &s;tones, or forty-two pounds, fi&s;h weight at <HI>Berwick.</HI></NOTE> the value ri&s;ing and falling according to the value ri&s;ing and falling according to the plenty of fi&s;h, or the pro&s;pect of a fair or foul wind. Some fi&s;h are &s;ent in this manner to <HI>London</HI> the lat|ter end of <HI>September,</HI> when the weather grows cool, but then the fi&s;h are full of large roes, grow very thin bellied, and are not e&s;teemed either palatable or whole&s;ome.</P>
<P>The price of fre&s;h fi&s;h in the month of <HI>July,</HI> when they are mo&s;t plentiful, has been known to be as low as 8<HI>d.</HI> per &s;tone, but la&s;t year never le&s;s than 16<HI>d.</HI> and from that to 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on for fi&s;hing in the <HI>Tweed</HI> begins <HI>No|vember</HI> the 30th, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sea&s;on.</NOTE> but the fi&s;hermen work very little till after <HI>Chri&s;tmas;</HI> it ends on <HI>Michaelmas-Day;</HI> yet the corporation of <HI>Berwick</HI> (who are con&s;ervators of the river) indulge the fi&s;hermen with a fornight pa&s;t that time, on account of the change of the &s;tyle.</P>
<P>There are on the river forty-one con&s;iderable fi&s;h|eries extending upwards, about fourteen miles from the mouth (the others above being of no great va|lue) which are rented for near 5400<HI>l.</HI> per annum. The expences attending the &s;ervants wages, nets, boats, &amp;c. amount to 5000<HI>l.</HI> more, which together makes up the &s;um 10400<HI>l.</HI> Now in con&s;equence
<PB N="245" REF="273">the produce mu&s;t defray all, and no le&s;s than twenty times that &s;um of fi&s;h will effect it, &s;o that 208000 &s;almon mu&s;t be caught there one year with an|other.</P>
<P>There is a misfortune attending the river <HI>Tweed,</HI> which is worthy a parlementary remedy; for there is no law for pre&s;erving the fi&s;h in it during the fence months, as there is in the ca&s;e of many other <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> rivers. This being the boundary between the two kingdoms, part of it belongs to the city of <HI>Berwick,</HI> and the whole north &s;ide (beginning about two miles from the town) is entirely <HI>Scotch</HI> pro|perty. From &s;ome di&s;agreement between the par|ties they will not unite for the pre&s;ervation of the fi&s;h, &s;o that in &s;ome fi&s;heries on the north &s;ide they continue killing &s;almon the whole winter, when the death of one fi&s;h is the de&s;truction of thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>The legi&s;lature began very early to pay attention to this important article: by the 13th <HI>Edward</HI> I&s;t. there is an act which prohibits the capture of the &s;almon from the Nativity of our Lady to St. <HI>Mar|tin</HI>'s Day, in the waters of the <HI>Humber, Ow&s;e, Trent, Done, Arre, Derwent, Wharfe, Nid, Yore, Swale,</HI> and <HI>Tees;</HI> and other monarchs in after-times, pro|vided in like manner for the &s;ecurity of the fi&s;h in other rivers.</P>
<P><HI>Scotland</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es great numbers of fine fi&s;heries on both &s;ides of that kingdom. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Scotland.</NOTE> The &s;almon are cured in the &s;ame manner as at <HI>Berwick,</HI> and a great quantity is &s;ent to <HI>London</HI> in the &s;pring; but after that time the adventurers begin to barrel and ex|port them to foreign countries: but we believe that
<PB N="246" REF="274">commerce is far le&s;s lucrative than it was in former times, partly owing to the great encrea&s;e of the <HI>Newfoundland</HI> fi&s;hery, and partly to the general re|laxation of the di&s;cipline of ab&s;tinence in the <HI>Ro|mi&s;h</HI> church.</P>
<P><HI>Ireland</HI> (particularly the north) abounds with this fi&s;h: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ireland.</NOTE> the mo&s;t con&s;iderable fi&s;hery is at <HI>Cranna,</HI> on the river <HI>Ban,</HI> about a mile and an half from <HI>Cole|raine.</HI> When I made the tour of that ho&s;pitable kingdom in 1754, it was rented by a neighboring gentleman for 620<HI>l.</HI> a year, who a&s;&s;ured me that the tenant, his predece&s;&s;or, gave 1600<HI>l.</HI> per ann. and was a much greater gainer by the bargain for the rea&s;ons before-mentioned, and on account of the number of poachers who de&s;troy the fi&s;h in the fence months.</P>
<P>The mouth of this river faces the north, and is finely &s;ituated to receive the fi&s;h that roam along the coa&s;t, in &s;earch of an inlet into &s;ome fre&s;h wa|ter, as they do all along that end of the kingdom which oppo&s;es it&s;elf to the northern ocean. We have &s;een near <HI>Ballica&s;tle,</HI> nets placed in the &s;ea at the foot of the promontories that jut into it, which the &s;almon &s;trike into as they are wandering clo&s;e to &s;hore, and numbers are taken by that method.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Ban</HI> they fi&s;h with nets eighteen &s;core yards long, and are continually drawing night and day the whole &s;ea&s;on, which we think la&s;ts about four months, two &s;ets of &s;ixteen men each alter|nately relieving one another. The be&s;t drawing is when the tide is coming in: we were told that at a &s;ingle draught there were once eight hundred and forty fi&s;h taken.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="275">A few miles higher up the river is a ware, where a con&s;iderable number of fi&s;h that e&s;cape the nets are taken. We were lately informed, that in the year 1760 about 320 tons were taken in the <HI>Cranna</HI> fi&s;hery.</P>
<P>The &s;almon are cured in this manner: they are fir&s;t &s;plit, and rubbed with fine &s;alt; and after ly|ing in pickle in great tubs, or re&s;ervoirs, for &s;ix weeks, are packed up with layers of coar&s;e brown <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> &s;alt in ca&s;ks, &s;ix of which make a ton. The&s;e are exported to <HI>Leghorn</HI> and <HI>Venice</HI> at the price of twelve or thirteen pounds per ton, but formerly from &s;ixteen to twenty-four pounds each.</P>
<P>The &s;almon is a fi&s;h &s;o generally known, <NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;cr.</NOTE> that a very brief de&s;cription will &s;erve. The large&s;t we ever heard of weighed &s;eventy-four pounds. The color of the back and &s;ides are grey, &s;ometimes &s;potted with black, &s;ometimes plain: the covers of the gills are &s;ubject to the &s;ame variety: the belly &s;ilvery: the no&s;e &s;harp pointed: the end of the un|der jaw in the males often turns up in form of a hook; &s;ometimes this curvature is very con&s;idera|ble: it is &s;aid that they lo&s;e this hook when they re|turn to the &s;ea.</P>
<P>The teeth are lodged in the jaws and on the tongue, and are &s;lender, but very &s;harp.</P>

<P>THE &s;amlet is the le&s;t of the trout kind, is frequent in the <HI>Wye,</HI> in the upper part of the <HI>Severn,</HI> and the rivers that run into it, in the north of <HI>England,</HI> and in <HI>Wales.</HI> It is by &s;everal imagined to be the fry of the &s;almon; but our rea&s;ons for di&s;&s;enting from that opinion are the&s;e:
<LIST>
<ITEM>Fir&s;t, It is well known that the &s;almon fry never
<PB N="254" REF="282">continue in the fre&s;h waters the whole year; but as numerous as they appear on their fir&s;t e&s;cape from the &s;pawn, all vani&s;h on the fir&s;t vernal flood that happens, which &s;weeps them into the &s;ea, and leaves &s;carce one behind.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Secondly, The growth of the &s;almon fry is &s;o quick and &s;o con&s;iderable, as &s;uddenly to exceed the bulk of the large&s;t &s;amlet: for example, the fry that have quitted the fre&s;h water in the &s;pring, not larger than gudgeons, return into it again a foot or more in length.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Thirdly, The &s;almon attain a con&s;iderable bulk before they begin to breed: the &s;amlets, on the contrary, are found male and female <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has been vulgarly imagined, that there were no other than males of this &s;pecies.</NOTE>, (d&s;tingui&s;hed by the milt and roe) of their common &s;ize.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Fourthly, They are found in the fre&s;h waters in all times of the year, and even at &s;ea&s;ons when the &s;almon fry have gained a con&s;iderable &s;ize. It is well known, that near <HI>Shrew&s;bury</HI> (where they are called <HI>Sam&s;ons</HI>) they are found in &s;uch quantities in the month of <HI>September,</HI> that a &s;kilful angler, in a coracle, will take with a fly from twelve to &s;ixteen dozen in a day.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>They &s;pawn in <HI>November</HI> and <HI>December,</HI> at which time tho&s;e of the <HI>Severn</HI> pu&s;h up towards the head of that fair river, quitting the le&s;&s;er brooks, and re|turn into them again when they have done.</P>
<P>They have a general re&s;emblance to the trout, therefore mu&s;t be de&s;cribed comparatively.</P>
<LIST>
<PB N="255" REF="283">
<ITEM>Fir&s;t, The head is proportionably narrower, and the mouth le&s;s than that of the trout.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Secondly, Their body is deeper.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Thirdly, They &s;eldom exceed &s;ix or &s;even inches in length.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Fourthly, The pectoral fins have generally but one large black &s;pot, tho' &s;ometimes a &s;ingle &s;mall one attends it; whereas the pectoral fins of the trout are more numerou&s;ly marked.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Fifthly, The &s;purious or fat fin on the back is ne|ver tipped with red; nor is the edge of the anal fin white.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Sixthly, The &s;pots on the body are fewer, and not &s;o bright. It is al&s;o marked from the back to the &s;ides with &s;ix or &s;even large blui&s;h bars; but this is not a certain character, as the &s;ame is &s;ome|times found in young trouts.</ITEM>

<P><PB N="258" REF="287">The large&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful we ever received were taken in <HI>Winander Mere,</HI> and were communi|cated to us by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Farri&s;h,</HI> of <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> with an account of their natural hi&s;tory. He favored me with five &s;pecimens, two under the name of the <HI>Ca&s;e Charr,</HI> male and female; another he called the <HI>Gelt Charr,</HI> i. e. a charr which had not &s;pawned the preceding &s;ea&s;on, and on that account is reckoned to be in the greate&s;t perfection. The two others were in&s;cribed, the <HI>Red Charr, the Silver or Gilt Charr,</HI> the <HI>Carpio Lacus</HI> BENACI, <HI>Raii &s;yn. pi&s;c.</HI> 66, which la&s;t are in <HI>We&s;tmorland</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed by the epithet <HI>red,</HI> by rea&s;on of the fle&s;h a&s;&s;uming a higher color than the other when dre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>On the clo&s;e&s;t examination, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Varie|ties.</NOTE> we could not di&s;cover any &s;pecific differences in the&s;e &s;pecimens, therefore mu&s;t de&s;cribe them as the &s;ame fi&s;h, &s;ubject only to a &s;light variation in their form, hereafter to be noted. But there is in another re&s;pect an e&s;&s;ential difference, we mean in their oeconomy, which is in all beings invariable; the particulars we &s;hall deli|ver in the very words of our obliging informant.</P>
<P>The <HI>Umbla minor,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Spawn|ing of the ca&s;e aharr.</NOTE> or ca&s;e charr, &s;pawns about <HI>Michaelmas,</HI> and chiefly in the river <HI>Brathy,</HI> which uniting with another called the <HI>Rowthay,</HI> about a quarter of a mile above the lake, they both fall into it together. The <HI>Brathy</HI> has a black rocky bottom; the bottom of the <HI>Rowthay</HI> is a bright &s;and, and into this the charr are never ob&s;erved to enter. Some of them however &s;pawn in the lake, but always in &s;uch parts of it which are &s;tony, and re&s;emble the
<PB N="259" REF="288">channel of the <HI>Brathy.</HI> They are &s;uppo&s;ed to be in the highe&s;t perfection about <HI>May,</HI> and continue &s;o all the &s;ummer, yet are rarely caught after <HI>April.</HI> When they are &s;pawning in the river they will take a bait, but at no other time, being commonly taken, as well as the other &s;pecies, in what they call <HI>brea&s;t nets,</HI> which are in length about twenty-four fathoms, and about five, where broade&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on which the other &s;pecies &s;pawns in is from the beginning of <HI>January</HI> to the end of <HI>March.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gilt charr.</NOTE> They are never known to a&s;cend the rivers, but al|ways in tho&s;e parts of the lake which are &s;pringy, where the bottom is &s;mooth and &s;andy, and the water warme&s;t. The fi&s;hermen judge of this warmth, by ob&s;erving that the water &s;eldom freezes in the places where they &s;pawn, except in inten&s;e fro&s;ts, and then the ice is thinner than in other parts of the lake. They are taken in greate&s;t plenty from the end of <HI>September</HI> to the end of <HI>November:</HI> at other times they are hardly to be met with. This &s;pecies is much more e&s;teemed for the table than the other, and is very delicate when potted.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that this account of the &s;pawn|ing &s;ea&s;on of the <HI>We&s;tmorland</HI> charrs, agrees very nearly with that of tho&s;e of <HI>Wales,</HI> the la&s;t appear|ing about a month later, keep moving from &s;ide to &s;ide of the pool, and then retire into the deep wa|ter, where they are &s;ometimes but rarely taken.</P>
<P>This remarkable circum&s;tance of the different &s;ea&s;on of &s;pawning in fi&s;h, apparently the &s;ame (for the red charr of <HI>Winander,</HI> is certainly not the

<P>We &s;hall now de&s;cribe the varieties by the names a&s;cribed to them in the north.</P>
<P>The length of the red charr to the divi&s;ion in its tail, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Red charr.</NOTE> was twelve inches; its bigge&s;t circumference almo&s;t &s;even.

<P>Each of the five fi&s;h had double no&s;trils, and &s;mall teeth in the jaws, roof of the mouth, and on the tongue.</P>
<P>The head, back, dor&s;al fin, and tail of each, was of a du&s;ky blue; the &s;ides rather paler, marked with numbers of bright red &s;pots: the bellies of the <HI>Red Charr</HI> were of a full and rich red; tho&s;e of the <HI>Ca&s;e Charr</HI> rather paler; from this particular the <HI>Welch</HI> call the&s;e fi&s;h <HI>Torgoch,</HI> or red belly.</P>

<P>The jaws in the <HI>Ca&s;e Charr</HI> are perfectly even; on the contrary, tho&s;e of the <HI>Red Charr</HI> were unequal,

<P>The <HI>Gelt,</HI> or <HI>Barren Charr,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gelt charr.</NOTE> was rather more &s;lender than the others, as being without &s;pawn.

It is found in the rivers of <HI>Derby|&s;hire;</HI> in &s;ome of tho&s;e of the north; in the <HI>Tame</HI> near <HI>Ludlow;</HI> and in the <HI>Lug,</HI> and other &s;treams near <HI>Leomin&s;ter:</HI> it is al&s;o very common in <HI>Lapland;</HI> the inhabitants make u&s;e of the guts of this fi&s;h in&s;tead of rennet, to make the chee&s;e which they get from the milk of the rein deer. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Flora Lap. <HI>109.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>It is a voracious fi&s;h, ri&s;es freely to the fly, and will very eagerly take a bait. It is a very &s;wift &s;wim|mer, and di&s;appears like the tran&s;ient pa&s;&s;age of a &s;hadow, from whence we believe is derived the name of <HI>Umbra.</HI></P>

<P>It is a fi&s;h of an elegant form; <NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;cr.</NOTE> le&s;s deep than that of a trout: the large&s;t we ever heard of was taken near <HI>Ludlow,</HI> which was above half a yard long, and weighed four pounds &s;ix ounces, but this was a very rare in&s;tance.</P>
<P>The irides are &s;ilvery, tinged with yellow: the teeth very minute, &s;eated in the jaws and the roof of the mouth, but none on the tongue: the head is du&s;ky: the covers of the gills of a glo&s;&s;y green: the back and &s;ides of a fine &s;ilvery grey, but when the fi&s;h is ju&s;t taken, varied &s;lightly with blue and gold: the &s;ide-line is &s;trait.</P>
<P>The &s;cales large, and the lower edges du&s;ky, forming &s;trait rows from head to tail.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t dor&s;al fin has twenty-one rays; the three or four fir&s;t are the &s;horte&s;t, the others almo&s;t of equal lengths; this fin is &s;potted, all the others are plain.</P>

<P>THE &s;melt inhabits the &s;eas of the northern parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and we believe never is found as far &s;outh as the <HI>Mediterranean:</HI> the <HI>Seine</HI> is one of the <HI>French</HI> rivers which receive it, but whether it is found &s;outh of that, we have not at pre&s;ent authority to &s;ay. If we can depend on the ob&s;er|vations of navigators, who generally have too much to think of to attend to the <HI>minutiae</HI> of natural hi&s;|tory, the&s;e fi&s;h are taken in the &s;traits of <HI>Magel|lan,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Narborough's Voy. <HI>123.</HI></NOTE> and of a mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing &s;ize, &s;ome mea&s;uring twenty inches in length, and eight in circumference.</P>
<P>They inhabit the &s;eas that wa&s;h the&s;e i&s;lands the whole year, and never go very remote from &s;hore, except when they a&s;cend the rivers. It is remarked in certain rivers that they appear a long time before they &s;pawn, being taken in great abundance in <HI>No|vember, December,</HI> and <HI>January,</HI> in the <HI>Thames</HI> and <HI>Dee,</HI> but in others not till <HI>February,</HI> and in <HI>March</HI>
<PB N="265" REF="294">and <HI>April</HI> they &s;pawn; after which <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the river <HI>Conway,</HI> near <HI>Llanrw&s;t,</HI> and in the <HI>Mer&s;ey</HI> they never continue above three or four weeks.</NOTE> they all return to the &s;alt water, and are not &s;een in the rivers till the next &s;ea&s;on. It has been ob&s;erved, that they never come into the <HI>Mer&s;ey</HI> as long as there is any &s;now water in the river.</P>
<P>The&s;e fi&s;h vary greatly in &s;ize, but the large&s;t we ever heard of was thirteen inches long, and weighed half a pound.</P>
<P>They have a very particular &s;cent, from whence is derived one of their <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> names <HI>Smelt,</HI> i. e. &s;mell it. That of <HI>Sparling,</HI> which is u&s;ed in <HI>Wales,</HI> and the north of <HI>England,</HI> is taken from the <HI>French Eperlan.</HI> There is a wonderful di&s;agreement in the opinion of people in re&s;pect to the &s;cent of this fi&s;h; &s;ome a&s;&s;ert it flavors of the violet; the <HI>Germans,</HI> for a very different rea&s;on, di&s;tingui&s;h it by the elegant title of <HI>Stinckfi&s;ch.</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">And not without rea&s;on, if we may depend on <HI>Linnaeus,</HI> who &s;ays there are in the <HI>Baltic</HI> two varieties, the one, which is called <HI>Nors, faetidi&s;&s;imus, &s;tercoris in&s;tar,</HI> which in the early &s;pring, when the pea&s;ants come to buy it, fills all the &s;treets of <HI>Up&s;al</HI> with the &s;mell.

<P>It is a fi&s;h of a very beautiful form and color: the head is tran&s;parent, and the &s;kin in general &s;o thin, that with a good micro&s;cope the blood may be ob|&s;erved to circulate.</P>
<P>The irides are &s;ilvery: the pupil of a full black: <NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;cr.</NOTE> the under jaw is the longe&s;t: in the front of the up|per jaw are four large teeth; tho&s;e in the &s;ides of both are &s;mall; in the roof of the mouth are two
<PB N="266" REF="295">rows of teeth; on the tongue two others of large teeth.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t dor&s;al fin has eleven rays; the pectoral fins the &s;ame number; the ventral eight; the anal fourteen.</P>
<P>The &s;cales are &s;mall, and readily drop off: the tail con&s;i&s;ts of nineteen rays, and is forked.</P>
<P>The color of the back is whiti&s;h, with a ca&s;t of green, beneath which it is varied with blue, and then &s;ucceeds a beautiful glo&s;s of a &s;ilvery hue.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this &s;pecies is another, <NOTE PLACE="marg">South|ampton <HI>&s;melt.</HI></NOTE> which was commu|nicated to us by the Hon. <HI>Daines Barrington,</HI> who de&s;cribes it in the&s;e words:</P>
<P>The <HI>Southampton</HI> &s;melt agrees with the common kind in having two back fins, but both of them are radiated; the fir&s;t with eight radii, the &s;econd with twelve; the belly fins have only five or &s;ix radii: the upper jaw is longer than the lower, and has a few teeth, whereas the lower has none: in color, tran&s;parency of the back and head, &s;ilver &s;tripes on the &s;ides, forked tail, &amp;c. it agrees nearly with the former, but has nothing of the violet &s;mell or ta&s;te. It &s;warms in that &s;ea, and is the common bait for whiting, mackrell, flat-fi&s;h, &amp;c. It is eaten fried, is tender and &s;weet, and without any &s;mall bones, but mu&s;t be gutted before it is dre&s;&s;ed. It grows to three or four inches in length, but is com|monly much le&s;s.</P>

<P>THE pike is common in mo&s;t of the lakes of <HI>Europe,</HI> but the large&s;t are tho&s;e taken in <HI>Lapland,</HI> which, according to <HI>Schaeffer,</HI> are &s;ome|times eight feet long. They are taken there in great abundance, dried, and exported for &s;ale. The large&s;t fi&s;h of this kind which we ever heard of in <HI>England,</HI> weighed thirty-five pounds.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="301">All writers who treat of this &s;pecies bring in|&s;tances of its va&s;t voraciou&s;ne&s;s. We have known one that was choaked by attempting to &s;wallow one of its own &s;pecies that proved too large a mor&s;el. It does not confine it&s;elf to feed on fi&s;h and frogs; it will devour the water rat, and draw down the young ducks as they are &s;wimming about. In a manu&s;cript note which we found, p. 244, of our copy of <HI>Plott</HI>'s Hi&s;tory of <HI>Stafford&s;hire,</HI> is the fol|lowing extraordinary fact: <Q>At Lord <HI>Gower</HI>'s ca|nal at <HI>Trentham,</HI> a pike &s;eized the head of a &s;wan as &s;he was feeding under water, and gorged &s;o much of it as killed them both. The &s;ervants perceiving the &s;wan with its head under water for a longer time than u&s;ual, took the boat, and found both &s;wan and pike dead <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This note we afterwards di&s;covered was wrote by Mr. <HI>Plott,</HI> of <HI>Oxford,</HI> who a&s;&s;ured me he in&s;erted it on good au|thority.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>But there are in&s;tances of its fiercene&s;s &s;till more &s;urprizing, and which indeed border a little on the marvellous. <HI>Ge&s;ner</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Ge&s;ner pi&s;c. <HI>503.</HI></NOTE> relates, that a fami&s;hed pike in the <HI>Rhone</HI> &s;eized on the lips of a mule that was brought to water, and that the bea&s;t drew the fi&s;h out before it could di&s;engage it&s;elf. That people have been bit by the&s;e voracious creatures while they were wa&s;hing their legs, and that they will even con|tend with the otter for its prey, and endeavour to force it out of its mouth <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Walton. <HI>157.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Small fi&s;h &s;hew the &s;ame unea&s;ine&s;s and dete&s;ta|tion at the pre&s;ence of this tyrant, as the little
<PB N="272" REF="302">birds do at the &s;ight of the hawk or owl. When the pike lies dormant near the &s;urface (as is fre|quently the ca&s;e) the le&s;&s;er fi&s;h are often ob&s;erved to &s;wim around it in va&s;t numbers, and in great an|xiety. Pike are often haltered in a noo&s;e, and taken while they lie thus a&s;leep, as they are often found in the ditches near the <HI>Thames</HI> in the month of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>In the &s;hallow water of the <HI>Lincoln&s;hire</HI> fens they are frequently taken in a manner peculiar, we be|lieve, to that county, and the i&s;le of <HI>Ceylon</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Knox'<HI>s</HI> Hi&s;t.

He &s;tands at the end of one of the little fen-boats, and frequently puts his ba&s;ket down to the bottom of the water, then poking a &s;tick into it, di&s;covers whether he has any booty by the &s;triking of the fi&s;h; and va&s;t numbers of pike are taken in this manner.</P>
<P>The longevity of this fi&s;h is very remarkable, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Longevi|ty.</NOTE> if we may credit the accounts given of it. <HI>Rzaczyn|&s;ki</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Nat.

<P>THIS fi&s;h which is known in many places, is known by the name of the <HI>Sea Needle.</HI> It comes in &s;hoals on our coa&s;ts in the beginning of &s;ummer, and precedes the mackrel: it has a re&s;em|blance to it in ta&s;te, but the light green, which &s;tains the back bone of this fi&s;h when boiled, gives many people a di&s;gu&s;t to it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Ray</HI> tells us, that when he was in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> the fi&s;hermen gave him the names of two &s;pecies of this fi&s;h, one they called <HI>Girrocks,</HI> the other <HI>Skippers;</HI> the&s;e we may &s;uppo&s;e to be the common kind, the other (according to Mr. <HI>Jago</HI>'s conjecture) is pro|bably the &s;ame with the <HI>Saurus</HI> of <HI>Rondeletius,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Saurus.</NOTE> p. 232, which both tho&s;e icthyologi&s;ts agree has a &s;hor|ter no&s;e than the common &s;pecies. We have no other de&s;cription of this fi&s;h than what is left us by <HI>Ron|deletius,</HI> who &s;ays, that it is &s;horter and thicker than the other; that the no&s;e is &s;horter and turns up; that
<PB N="275" REF="305">the edges of the jaws are &s;errated; and that between the anal fin and the tail it has &s;everal &s;purious fins like the mackrel. We do not venture to make a di&s;tinct article of this fi&s;h, becau&s;e Mr. <HI>Jago</HI> has not pointed out the &s;pecific difference; but we thought it nece&s;&s;ary to give this brief de&s;cription of it from <HI>Rondeletius,</HI> to &s;upply that defect in ca&s;e the <HI>Saurus</HI> &s;hould prove a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> fi&s;h.</P>
<P>The common &s;ea pike, or &s;ea needle, <NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;cr.</NOTE> &s;ometimes grows to the length of three feet, or more.</P>
<P>The jaws are very long, &s;lender, and &s;harp pointed; the under extends much farther than the upper, and the edges of both are armed with numbers of &s;hort &s;lender teeth: the in&s;ide of the mouth is purple: the tongue &s;mall: the eyes large: the irides &s;ilvery: the no&s;trils wide and round.</P>
<P>The body is &s;lender: the belly quite flat, bounded on both &s;ides by a rough line.</P>
<P>The pectoral fins con&s;i&s;t of twelve rays; the ven|tral fins &s;mall, and placed very remote from the head, con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ix rays, the fir&s;t &s;piny.</P>
<P>The dor&s;al fin lies on the very lower part of the back, con&s;i&s;ts of eighteen rays; the fir&s;t are high, the others lower as they approach the tail; the anal fin is of the &s;ame form, and placed oppo&s;ite the other: the tail is forked.</P>
<P>The colors are extremely beautiful when the fi&s;h is in the water: the back of a fine green, beneath that appears a rich changeable blue and purple: the &s;ides and belly are of a fine &s;ilvery hue.</P>

<P>They begin to appear off the <HI>Shetland</HI> i&s;les in <HI>April</HI> and <HI>May;</HI> the&s;e are only forerunners of the grand &s;hoal which comes in <HI>June,</HI> and their appearance is marked by certain &s;igns by the numbers of birds, &s;uch as gannets, and others which follow to prey on them: but when the main body approaches, its breadth and its depth is &s;uch as to alter the appear|ance of the very ocean. It is divided into di&s;tinct columns of five or &s;ix miles in length, and three or four in breadth, and they drive the water before them with a kind of rippling: &s;ometimes they &s;link for the &s;pace of ten or fifteen minutes, then ri&s;e
<PB N="286" REF="316">again to the &s;urface, and in bright weather reflect a variety of &s;plendid colors, like a field of the mo&s;t pretious gems, in which, or rather in a much more valuable light, &s;hould this &s;tupendous gift of Pro|vidence be con&s;idered by the inhabitants of the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> i&s;les.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t check this army meets in its march &s;outh|ward, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Separa|tion.</NOTE> is from the <HI>Shetland</HI> i&s;les, which divide it in|to two parts; one wing takes to the ea&s;t, the other to the we&s;tern &s;hores of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and fill every bay and creek with their numbers; others pa&s;s on towards <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> the great and antient mart of herrings; they then pa&s;s thro' the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> channel, and after that in a manner di&s;appear. Tho&s;e which take to the we&s;t, after offering them&s;elves to the <HI>He|brides,</HI> where the great &s;tationary fi&s;hery is, proceed towards the north of <HI>Ireland,</HI> where they meet with a &s;econd interruption, and are obliged to make a &s;e|cond divi&s;ion; the one takes to the we&s;tern &s;ide, and is &s;carce perceived, being &s;oon lo&s;t in the im|men&s;ity of the <HI>Atlantic;</HI> but the other, which pa&s;&s;es into the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> &s;ea, rejoices and feeds the inhabi|tants of mo&s;t of the coa&s;ts that border on it.</P>
<P>The&s;e brigades, as we may call them, which are thus &s;eparated from the greater columns, are often capricious in their motions, and do not &s;hew an in|variable attachment to their haunts. We have had in our time in&s;tances of their entirely quitting the coa&s;ts of <HI>Cardigan&s;hire,</HI> and vi&s;iting tho&s;e of <HI>Caer|narvon&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Flint&s;hire,</HI> where they continued for a few years, but in the pre&s;ent year have quite de|&s;erted our &s;ea, and returned to their old &s;eats. The
<PB N="287" REF="317">&s;ea&s;on of their appearance among us was very late, never before the latter end of <HI>November:</HI> their con|tinuance till <HI>February.</HI></P>
<P>Were we inclined to con&s;ider this partial migra|tion of the herring in a moral light, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Provi|dential in&s;tinct.</NOTE> we might re|flect with veneration and awe on the mighty Power which originally impre&s;&s;ed on this mo&s;t u&s;eful body of his creatures, the in&s;tinct that directs and points out the cour&s;e, that ble&s;&s;es and enriches the&s;e i&s;lands, which cau&s;es them at certain and invariable times to quit the va&s;t polar deeps, and offer them|&s;elves to our expecting fleets. That benevolent Be|ing has never, from the earlie&s;t records, been once known to withdraw this ble&s;&s;ing from the whole, tho' he often thinks proper to deny it to particulars; yet this partial failure (for which we &s;ee no natural rea&s;on) &s;hould fill us with the mo&s;t exalted and grareful &s;en&s;e of his Providence, for impre&s;&s;ing &s;o invariable and general in&s;tinct on the&s;e fi&s;h towards a &s;outhward migration, when the whole is to be be|nefited, and to withdraw it only when a minute part is to &s;uffer.</P>
<P>This in&s;tinct was given them, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Spawa|ing.</NOTE> that they might re|move for the &s;ake of depo&s;iting their &s;pawn in warm|er &s;eas, that would mature and vivify it more a&s;|&s;uredly than tho&s;e of the frigid zone. It is not from defect of food that they &s;et them&s;elves in motion, for they come to us full and fat, and on their return are almo&s;t univer&s;ally ob&s;erved to be lean and mi|&s;erable. What their food is near the pole, we are not yet informed; but in our &s;eas they feed much on the <HI>Oni&s;cus Marinus,</HI> a cru&s;taceous in&s;ect, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Food.</NOTE> and &s;ometimes on their own fry.</P>

Tho' we have no particular authority for it, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Return.</NOTE> yet as very few young herrings are found in our &s;eas during winter, it &s;eems mo&s;t certain that they mu&s;t return to their parental haunts beneath the ice, to repair the va&s;t de&s;truction of their race during &s;ummer, by men, fowl and fi&s;h. Some of the old herrings eontinue on our coa&s;ts the whole year: the <HI>Scarborough</HI> fi&s;hermen never put down their nets but they catch a few; but the numbers that remain are not worth men|tion in compari&s;on to the numbers that return.</P>
<P>Herrings vary greatly in &s;ize. <NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;cr.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Travis</HI> com|municated to me the information of an experienced fi&s;her, who informed him that there is &s;ometimes taken near <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> a herring di&s;tingui&s;hed by a black &s;pot above the no&s;e; and that he once &s;aw one that was twenty-one inches and an half long. He in&s;i&s;ted that it was a different &s;pecies, and va|ried as much from the common herring as that does from the pilchard. This we mention in order to incite &s;ome curious per&s;on on that coa&s;t to a far|ther enquiry.</P>
<P>The eye is very large: the edges of the upper jaw and the tongue are very rough, but the whole mouth
<PB N="289" REF="319">is void of teeth: the gill covers are very loo&s;e, and open very wide; which occa&s;ions the almo&s;t in&s;tant death of the herring when taken out of the water, which is well known, even to a proverb.</P>
<P>The dor&s;al fin con&s;i&s;ts of about &s;eventeen rays, and is placed beyond the centre of gravity, &s;o that when the fi&s;h is &s;u&s;pended by it, the head immediately dips down: the two ventral fins have nine rays; the pectoral &s;eventeen; the anal fourteen: the tail is much forked.</P>
<P>The lateral line is not apparent, unle&s;s the &s;cales are taken off: the &s;ides are compre&s;&s;ed: the belly &s;harply carinated, but the ridge quite &s;mooth, and not in the le&s;t &s;errated.</P>
<P>The &s;cales are large, thin, and fall off with a &s;light touch.</P>
<P>The color of the back and &s;ides green, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Color.</NOTE> varied with blue: the belly &s;ilvery.</P>
<P>The herring fi&s;hery is of great antiquity: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fi&s;hery.</NOTE> the in|du&s;trious <HI>Dutch</HI> fir&s;t engaged in it about the year 1164: they were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it for &s;everal cen|turies, but at length its value become &s;o ju&s;tly to be known, that it gave ri&s;e to mo&s;t ob&s;tinate and well-di&s;puted wars between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and them; but &s;till their diligence and &s;kill gives them a &s;uperiority over us in that branch of trade.</P>
<P>Our great &s;tations are off the <HI>Shetland</HI> and <HI>We&s;tern I&s;les,</HI> and off the coa&s;t of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> in which the <HI>Dutch</HI> al&s;o &s;hare. <HI>Yarmouth</HI> has long been famous for its herring fair <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This fair was regulated by an act, commonly called the <HI>Sta|tute of Herrings,</HI> in the 31&s;t year of <HI>Edward</HI> III.</NOTE>; that town is obliged, by its

<P>The approach of the pilchard is known by much the &s;ame &s;igns as tho&s;e that indicate the arrival of the herring.

<P><PB N="293" REF="324">The numbers that are taken at one &s;hooting out of the nets, is amazingly great.

<P>The back is more elevated: the belly le&s;s &s;harp: the dor&s;al fin of the pilchard is placed exactly in the centre of gravity, &s;o that when taken up by it, the body pre&s;erves an equilibrium, whereas that of the herring dips at the head: the dor&s;al fin of the pil|chard we examined, being placed only three inches eight tenths from the tip of the no&s;e; that of the herring four inches one tenth.</P>

<P>The <HI>Severn</HI> &s;had is e&s;teemed a very delicate fi&s;h about the time of its fir&s;t appearance, e&s;pecially in that part of the river that flows by <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> where they are taken in nets, and u&s;ually &s;ell dearer than &s;almon: &s;ome are &s;ent to <HI>London,</HI> where the fi&s;hmon|gers di&s;tingui&s;h them from tho&s;e of the <HI>Thames,</HI> by the <HI>French</HI> name of <HI>Alo&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Whether they &s;pawn in this river and the <HI>Wye</HI> is not determined, for their fry has not yet been a&s;cer|tained. The old fi&s;h come from the &s;ea into the river in full roe.

<P><PB N="299" REF="330">The <HI>Twaite,</HI> on the contrary, weighs from half a pound to two pounds, which it never exceeds.</P>

<L>Came into <HI>England</HI> all in one year.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="332">As to the two la&s;t articles we have &s;ome doubts, the others we believe to be true. <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> wants the&s;e fi&s;h at this day; <HI>Sueden</HI> has them only in the ponds of the people of fa&s;hion; <HI>Poli&s;h Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> is the chief &s;eat of the carp; they abound in the rivers and lakes of that country, particularly in the <HI>Fri&s;ch</HI> and <HI>Curi&s;ch-haff,</HI> where they are taken of a va&s;t &s;ize. They are there a great article of commerce, and &s;ent in well-boats to <HI>Sueden</HI> and <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia.</HI> The mer|chants purcha&s;e them out of the waters of the <HI>no|ble&s;&s;e</HI> of the country, who draw a good revenue from this article. Neither are there wanting among our gentry, in&s;tances of &s;ome who make good profit of their ponds.</P>
<P>The antients do not &s;eparate the carp from the &s;ea fi&s;h. We are credibly informed that they are &s;ometimes found in the harbor of <HI>Dantzick,</HI> between the town and a &s;mall place called <HI>Hela.</HI></P>
<P>Carp are very long lived. <HI>Ge&s;ner</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ge&s;ner pi&s;c. <HI>312.</HI></NOTE> brings an in|&s;tance of one that was an hundred years old. They al&s;o grow to a very great &s;ize. On our own know|lege we can &s;peak of none that exceeded twenty pounds in weight; but <HI>Jovius</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">De pi&s;cibus Romanis. <HI>131.</HI></NOTE> &s;ays, that they were &s;ometimes taken in the <HI>Lacus Larius</HI> (the <HI>Lago di Como)</HI> of two hundred pounds weight; and <HI>Rzaczyn&s;ki</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t.

<P>They are al&s;o extremely tenacious of life, and will live for a mo&s;t remarkable time out of water.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="333">An experiment has been made by placing a carp in a net, well wrapped up in wet mo&s;s, the mouth only remaining out, and then hung up in a cellar, or &s;ome cool place: the fi&s;h is frequently fed with white bread and milk, and is be&s;ides often plunged into water. Carp thus managed have been known, not only to have lived above a fortnight, but to grow exceedingly fat, and far &s;uperior in ta&s;te to tho&s;e that are immediately killed from the pond <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was told me by a gentleman of the utmo&s;t veracity, who had twice made the experiment.

<P>The carp is a prodigious breeder: <NOTE PLACE="foot">Foecun|dity.</NOTE> its quantity of roe has been &s;ometimes found &s;o great, that when taken out and weighed again&s;t the fi&s;h it&s;elf, the for|mer has been found to preponderate. We have for|bore in this work to enter into minute calculations of the numbers each fi&s;h may produce. It has al|ready been mo&s;t &s;kilfully performed by Mr. <HI>Harmer,</HI> and printed in the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions</HI> of the year 1767. We &s;hall, in our Appendix, take the liberty of borrowing &s;uch part of his tables of the foecundity of fi&s;h, as will demon&s;trate the kind at|tention of Providence, towards the pre&s;erving &s;o u&s;eful a cla&s;s of animals for the &s;ervice of its other creatures.</P>
<P>The&s;e fi&s;h are extremely cunning, and on that ac|count are by &s;ome &s;tyled the <HI>river fox.</HI> They will &s;ometimes leap over the nets, and e&s;cape that way; at others, will immer&s;e them&s;elves &s;o deep in the mud, as to let the net pa&s;s over them. They are
<PB N="303" REF="334">al&s;o very &s;hy of taking a bait; yet at the &s;pawning time they are &s;o &s;imple, as to &s;uffer them&s;elves to be tickled, handled, and caught by any body that will attempt it.</P>
<P>This fi&s;h is apt to mix its milt with the roe of other fi&s;h, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Spurious breed.</NOTE> from which is produced a &s;purious breed: we have &s;een the offspring of the carp and tench, which bore the greate&s;t re&s;emblance to the fir&s;t: we have al&s;o heard of the &s;ame mixture between the carp and bream.</P>
<P>The carp is of a thick &s;hape: the &s;cales very large, <NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;cr.</NOTE> and when in be&s;t &s;ea&s;on of a fine gilded hue.</P>
<P>The jaws are of equal length; there are two teeth in the jaws, or on the tongue; but at the entrance of the gullet, above and below, are certain bones that act on each other, and comminute the food be|fore it pa&s;&s;es down.</P>
<P>On each &s;ide of the mouth is a &s;ingle beard; above tho&s;e on each &s;ide another, but &s;horter: the dor&s;al fin extends far towards the tail, which is a little bi|furcated; the third ray of the dor&s;al fin is very &s;trong, and armed with &s;harp teeth, pointing down|wards; the third ray of the anal fin is con&s;tructed in the &s;ame manner.</P>

<P>THE taking of the&s;e, <HI>Au&s;onius</HI> lets us know, was the &s;port of children, ALBURNOS <HI>praedam puerilibus hamis.</HI></P>
<P>They are very common in many of our rivers, and keep together in large &s;hoals. The&s;e fi&s;h &s;eem at certain &s;ea&s;ons to be affected with the vertigo; they tumble about near the &s;urface of the water, and are incapable of &s;wimming far from the place, but in about two hours recover, and di&s;appear. Fi&s;h thus affected the <HI>Thames</HI> fi&s;hermen call <HI>mad bleaks.</HI></P>
<P>Artificial pearls are made with &s;cales of this fi&s;h, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Artifi|cial pearls.</NOTE> and we think of the dace. They are beat into a fine powder, then diluted with water, and intro|duced into a thin gla&s;s bubble, which is afterwards filled with wax. The <HI>French</HI> were the inventors of this art. Doctor <HI>Li&s;ter</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Journey to <HI>Paris,</HI> 142.</NOTE> tells us, that when he was at <HI>Paris,</HI> a certain arti&s;t u&s;ed in one winter thirty hampers full of fi&s;h in this manufacture.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="347">The bleak &s;eldom exceeds five or &s;ix inches in length: <NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;cr.</NOTE> their body is &s;lender, greatly compre&s;&s;ed &s;ideways, not unlike that of the &s;prat.</P>
<P>The eyes are large: the irides of a pale yellow: the under jaw the longe&s;t: the lateral line crooked: the gills &s;ilvery: the back green: the &s;ides and belly &s;ilvery: the fins pellucid: the &s;cales fall off very ea&s;ily: the tail much forked.</P>

<P>There are various conjectures about this &s;pecies, but all terminate in a &s;uppo&s;ition that they are the fry of &s;ome fi&s;h, but few agree to which kind they owe their origin. Some attribute it to the &s;had, others to the &s;prat, the &s;melt, and the bleak. That they neither belong to the &s;had, nor the &s;prat, is evident from the number of branchio&s;tegous rays, which in tho&s;e are eight, in this only three. That they are not the young of &s;melts is as clear, becau&s;e they want the <HI>pinna adipo&s;a,</HI> or rayle&s;s fin; and that they are not the offspring of the bleak is extremely probable, &s;ince we never heard of the white bait being found in any other river, notwith&s;tanding the bleak is very common in &s;everal of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;treams: but as the white bait bears a greater &s;imi|larity to this fi&s;h than to any other we have men|tioned,
<PB N="317" REF="348">we give it a place here as an appendage to the bleak, rather than form a di&s;tinct article of a fi&s;h which it is impo&s;&s;ible to cla&s;s with certainty.</P>
<P>It is evident that it is of the carp or <HI>Cyprinus</HI> ge|nus: it has only three branchio&s;tegous rays, and only one dor&s;al fin; and in re&s;pect to the form of the body is compre&s;&s;ed like that of the bleak.</P>
<P>Its u&s;ual length is two inches: the under jaw is the longe&s;t: the irides &s;ilvery, the pupil black: the dor&s;al fin is placed nearer to the head than to the tail, and con&s;i&s;ts of about fourteen rays: the &s;ide line is &s;trait: the tail forked, the tips black.</P>

<P>THESE fi&s;h are now quite naturalized in this country, and breed as freely in the open wa|ters as the common carp.</P>
<P>They were fir&s;t introduced into <HI>England</HI> about the year 1691, but were not generally known till 1728, when a great number were brought over, and pre&s;ented fir&s;t to Sir <HI>Mathew Dekker,</HI> and by him circulated round the neighborhood of <HI>Lon|don,</HI> from whence they have been di&s;tributed to mo&s;t parts of the country.</P>
<P>In <HI>China</HI> the mo&s;t beautiful kinds are taken in a &s;mall lake in the province of <HI>Che-Kyang.</HI> Every per&s;on of fa&s;hion keeps them for amu&s;ement, either in porcellane ve&s;&s;els, or in the &s;mall ba&s;ons that decorate the courts of the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> hou&s;es. The beauty of their colors, and their lively motions, give great entertainment, e&s;pecially to the ladies, who&s;e plea&s;ures, by rea&s;on of the cruel policy of that country, are extremely limited.</P>
<P>In form of the body they bear a great re&s;em|blance to a carp. <NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;cr.</NOTE> They have been known in this i&s;land to arrive at the length of eight inches; in
<PB N="320" REF="351">their native place they are &s;aid <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Du Halde, <HI>316.</HI></NOTE> to grow to the &s;ize of our large&s;t herring.</P>
<P>The no&s;trils are tubular, and form &s;ort of ap|pendages above the no&s;e: the dor&s;al fin and the tail vary greatly in &s;hape: the tail is naturally bifid, but in many is trifid, and in &s;ome even quadrifid: the anal fins are the &s;tronge&s;t characters of this &s;pe|cies, being placed not behind one another like tho&s;e of other fi&s;h, but oppo&s;ite each other like the ven|tral fins.</P>
<P>The colors vary greatly; &s;ome are marked with a fine blue, with brown, with bright &s;ilver; but the general and predominant color is gold of a mo&s;t amazing &s;plendor; but their colors and form need not be dwelt on, &s;ince tho&s;e who want opportunity of &s;eeing the living fi&s;h, may &s;urvey them expre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t animated manner, in the works of our ingenious and hone&s;t friend Mr. <HI>George Edwards.</HI></P>

<P>The gentlemen I am principally indebted to for my informations are <HI>J. Ar&s;cott,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of <HI>Tehott,</HI> in <HI>De|von&s;hire,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Pitfield,</HI> of <HI>Exe|ter.</HI> Some of the&s;e accounts were addre&s;&s;ed to Doctor <HI>Milles,</HI> Dean of <HI>Exeter;</HI> others to the worthy Prelate abovementioned, to whom I owe the&s;e and many other agree|able corre&s;pondencies; others again to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Ar&s;cott</HI>'s letters give a very ample hi&s;tory of the nature of the toad: they were both addre&s;&s;ed to Doctor <HI>Milles,</HI> and both were the re&s;ult of certain queries I propo&s;ed, which the former was &s;o obliging as to give him&s;elf the trouble of an&s;wering in a mo&s;t &s;atisfactory manner.</P>
<P>I &s;hall fir&s;t take the liberty of citing Mr. <HI>Ar&s;cott</HI>'s letter of <HI>Sep|tember</HI> the 23d, 1768, which men|tions &s;ome very curious particulars of this innocent reptile, which, for &s;uch a number of years found an a&s;ylum, from the good &s;en&s;e of a
<PB N="323" REF="354">family which &s;oared above all vul|gar prejudices.</P>
<Q><P>It would give me the greate&s;t plea&s;ure to be able to inform you of any particulars worthy Mr. <HI>Pennant</HI>'s notice, concerning the toad who lived &s;o many years with us, and was &s;o great a favo|rite. The greate&s;t curio&s;ity in it was its becoming &s;o remark|ably tame. It had frequented &s;ome &s;teps before the hall-door &s;ome years before my acquaint|ance commenced with it, and had been admired by my father for its &s;ize (which was of the large&s;t I ever met with) who con&s;tantly payed it a vi&s;it every evening. I knew it my&s;elf above thirty years, and by con|&s;tantly feeding it, brought it to be &s;o tame that it always came to the candle, and looked up as if expecting to be taken up and brought upon the table, where I always fed it with in&s;ects of all &s;orts: it was fonde&s;t of fle&s;h maggots, which I kept in bran; it would follow them, and when within a proper di&s;tance, would fix its eye, and remain motion|le&s;s for near a quarter of a mi|nute,
<PB N="324" REF="355">as if preparing for the &s;troke, which was an in&s;tanta|neous throwing its tongue at a great di&s;tance upon the in&s;ect, which &s;tuck to the tip by a gluti|nous matter: the motion is quick|er than the eye can follow <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This rapid capture of its prey might give occa&s;ion to the report of its fa&s;cinating powers. <HI>Linnaeus</HI> &s;ays, <HI>In&s;ecta in &s;auces fa&s;cine revocat.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>I always imagined that the root of its tongue was placed in the fore part of its under jaw, and the tip towards its throat, by which the motion mu&s;t be a half circle; by which, when its tongue recovered its &s;ituation, the in&s;ect at the tip would be brought to the place of deglutition. I was confirmed in this by never ob|&s;erving any internal motion in its mouth, excepting one &s;wallow the in&s;tant its tongue returned. Po&s;|&s;ibly I might be mi&s;taken, for I never di&s;&s;ected one, but contented my&s;elf with opening its mouth, and &s;lightly in&s;pecting it.</P>
<P>You may imagine that a toad generally dete&s;ted (altho' one of the mo&s;t inoffen&s;ive of all ani|mals) &s;o much taken notice of and befriended, excited the cu|rio&s;ity
<PB N="325" REF="356">of all comers to the hou&s;e, who all de&s;ired to &s;ee it fed, &s;o that even ladies &s;o far conquered the horrors in&s;tilled into them by nurfes, as to de&s;ire to &s;ee it. This produced innumerable and improbable reports, making it as large as the crown of a hat, &amp;c. &amp;c. This I hope will ac|count for my not giving you par|ticulars more worth your notice. When I fir&s;t read the account in the papers of toads &s;ucking can|cerous brea&s;ts, I did not believe a word of it, not thinking it po&s;|&s;ible for them to &s;uck, having no lips to embrace the part, and a tongue &s;o oddly formed; but as the fact is thoroughly verified, I mo&s;t impatiently long to be fully informed of all particulars re|lating to it</P></Q>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e accounts will &s;erve to point out &s;ome errors I had adopted, in re&s;pect to this reptile in my fir&s;t &s;heet, yet it is with much plea&s;ure I lay before the public a more authentic hi&s;tory, collected from Mr. <HI>Ar&s;cott</HI>'s &s;econd favor; the an&s;wer points out my queries, which it is needle&s;s to repeat.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="357">
<HI>Tehott, Nov.</HI> 1, 1768.</P>
<Q><P>In re&s;pect to the queries I &s;hall here give the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory an&s;wers I am capable of.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I cannot &s;ay how long my father had been acquainted with the toad before I knew it; but when I fir&s;t was acquainted with it, he u&s;ed to mention it as the old toad I've known &s;o many years; I can an&s;wer for thirty|&s;ix years.</P>
<P>Secondly, No toads that I ever &s;aw appeared in the winter &s;ea|&s;on. The old toad made its ap|pearance as &s;oon as the warm wea|ther came, and I always concluded it retired to &s;ome dry bank to repo&s;e till the &s;pring. When we new-lay'd the &s;teps I had two holes made in the third &s;tep on each, with a hollow of more than a yard long for it, in which I imagine it &s;lept, as it came from thence at its fir&s;t appearance.</P>
<P>Thirdly, It was &s;eldom pro|voked: neither that toad (nor the multitudes I have &s;een tormented with great cruelty) ever &s;hewed the le&s;t de&s;ire of revenge, by &s;pitting or emitting any juice from their pimples. Sometimes
<PB N="327" REF="358">upon taking it up it would let out a great quantity of clear water, which, as I have often &s;een it do the &s;ame upon the &s;teps when quite quict, was certainly its urine, and no more than a natural evacuation.</P>
<P>Fourthly, A toad has no particu|lar enmity for the &s;pider; he u&s;ed to eat five or &s;ix with his millepides (which I take to be its chief food) that I generally provided for it, be|fore I found out that fle&s;h maggots, by their continual motion, was the mo&s;t tempting bait; but when of|fered it eat blowing flies and hum|ble bees that come from the rat|tailed maggot in gutters, or in &s;hort any in&s;ect that moved. I imagine if a bee was to be put before a toad, it would certainly eat it to its co&s;t; but as bees are &s;eldom &s;tirring at the &s;ame time that toads are, they can &s;eldom come in their way, as they &s;eldom appear after &s;un-ri&s;ing, or before &s;un-&s;et. In the heat of the day they will come to the mouth of their hole, I believe, for air. I once from my parlour window ob&s;erved a large toad I had in the bank of a bowling-green, about twelve at noon, a very hot day, very bu&s;y and active upon the gra&s;s; &s;o uncom|mon
<PB N="328" REF="359">an appearance made me go out to &s;ee what it was, when I found an innumerable &s;warm of winged ants had dropped round his hole, which temptation was as irre&s;i&s;tible as a turtle would be to a luxurious al|derman.</P>
<P>Fifthly, Whether our toad ever propagated its &s;pecies I know not, rather think not, as it always ap|peared well, and not le&s;&s;ened in bulk, which it mu&s;t have done, I &s;hould think, if it had di&s;charged &s;o large a quantity of &s;pawn as toads generally do. The females that are to propagate in the &s;pring, I imagine, in&s;tead of retiring to dry holes, go into the bottom of ponds, and lay torpid among&s;t the weeds; for to my great &s;urprize in the middle of the winter, having for amu&s;ement put a long pole into my pond, and twi&s;ted it till it had gathered a large volume of weed, on taking it off I found many toads, and having cut &s;ome a&s;under with my knife, by ac|cident, to get off the weed, found them full of &s;pawn not thoroughly formed. I am not po&s;itive, but think there were a few males in <HI>March:</HI> I know there are thirty
<PB N="329" REF="360">males <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>John Hunter</HI> has a&s;&s;ured me that during his re&s;idence at <HI>Bellei&s;le,</HI> he di&s;&s;ected &s;ome hundreds of toads, yet never met with a &s;ingle female among them.</NOTE> to one female, twelve or fourteen of whom I have &s;een cling|ing round a female: I have often di&s;engaged her, and put her into a &s;olitary male, to &s;ee with what eager|ne&s;s he would &s;eize her. They im|pregnate the &s;pawn as it is drawn <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">I was incredulous as to the <HI>ob&s;tetrical</HI> offices of the male toad, but &s;ince the end is &s;o well accounted for, and the fact e&s;tabli&s;hed by &s;uch good authority, belief mu&s;t take place.
<P>Mr. <HI>Demours,</HI> in the Memoirs of the <HI>French</HI> Academy, as tran&s;lated by Dr. <HI>Templeman, vol.</HI> I. 371. has been very particular in re&s;pect to the male toad, as acting the part of an <HI>Accoucheur;</HI> his account is curious, and clames a place here:
<Q><P>In the evening of one of the long days in &s;ummer, Mr. <HI>Demours</HI> being in the king's garden perceived two toads <HI>cou|pled together</HI> at the edge of an hole, which was formed in part by a great &s;tone at the top.</P>
<P>Curio&s;ity drew him to &s;ee what was the occa&s;ion of the mo|tions he ob&s;erved, when two facts equally new &s;urprized him; the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> was the extreme difficulty the female had in laying her eggs, in&s;omuch that &s;he did not &s;eem capable of being delivered of them without &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The <HI>&s;econd</HI> was, that the male was mounted on the back of the female, and exerted all his &s;trength with his hinder feet in pulling out the eggs, whil&s;t his fore-feet embraced her brea&s;t.</P>
<P>In order to apprehend the manner of his working in the delivery of the female, the reader mu&s;t ob&s;erve that the paws of the&s;e animals, as well tho&s;e of the fore-feet as of the hin|der, are divided into &s;everal toes, which can perform the office of fingers.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be remarked likewi&s;e, that the eggs of this &s;pecies of toads are included each in a membranous coat that is very firm, in which is contained the embryo; and that the&s;e eggs, which are oblong and about two lines in length, being fa&s;ten|ed one to another by a &s;hort but very &s;trong cord form a kind of chaplet, the beads of which are di&s;tant from each other about the half of their length. It is by drawing this cord with his paw that the male performs the function of a mid|wife, and acquits him&s;elf in it with a dexterity that one would not expect from &s;o lumpi&s;h an animal.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ence of the ob&s;erver did not a little di&s;compo&s;e the male; for &s;ome time he &s;topped &s;hort, and threw on the <HI>curious impertinent</HI> a fixed look that marked his di&s;quietne&s;s and fear; but he &s;oon returned to his work with more precipita|tion than before, and a moment <HI>after</HI> he appeared undetermi|ned whether he &s;hould continue it or not. The female like|wi&s;e di&s;covered her unea&s;ine&s;s at the &s;ight of the &s;tranger, by motions that interrupted &s;ometimes the male in his operation. At length, whether the &s;ilence and &s;teady po&s;ture of the &s;pec|tator had di&s;&s;ipated their fear, or that the <HI>ca&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> was urgent, the male re&s;umed his work with the &s;ame vigour, and &s;ucce&s;s|fully performed his function.</P></Q></P></NOTE> out in long &s;trings, like a neck|lace,
<PB N="330" REF="361">many yards long, not in a large, quantity of jelly, like frogs &s;pawn. <HI>N. B.</HI> After having held a female &s;ome time in my hand, I have, to try if there was any &s;mell, put my finger a foot under water to a male, who has immediately &s;eized it, and &s;tuck to as firmly as if it was a fe|male. <HI>Quere,</HI> Would they &s;eize a finger or rag that had touched a cancerous ulcer?</P>
<P>Sixthly, In&s;ects being their food, I never &s;aw any toad &s;hew any lik|ing or di&s;like to any plant <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This que&s;tion aro&s;e from an a&s;&s;ertion of <HI>Linnoeus,</HI> that the toad delighted in filthy herbs. <HI>Delectatur Cotula, Actoea, Stachyde foetidis.</HI> The unhappy deformity of the animal &s;eems to be the only ground of this as well as another mi&s;repre&s;entation, of its conveying a poi&s;on from its pimples, its touch, and even its breath. <HI>Verrucae lactejcentes venenatoe infu&s;oe tactu, anhelitu.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Seventhly, I hardly remember any per&s;ons taking it up except
<PB N="331" REF="362">my father and my&s;elf: I do not know whether it had any particular attachment to us.</P>
<P>Eighhtly, In re&s;pect to its end, I an&s;wer this la&s;t quere. Had it not been for a tame raven, I make no doubt but it would have been now living; who one day &s;eeing it at the mouth of its hole, pulled it out, and although I re&s;cued it, pulled out one eye, and hurt it &s;o, that notwith&s;tanding its living a twelve|month it never enjoyed it&s;elf, and had a difficulty of taking its food, mi&s;&s;ing the mark for want of its eye: before that accident had all the appearance of perfect health.</P></Q>
<P>What Mr. <HI>Pitfield</HI> communicated to me &s;erves farther to evince the patient and pacific di&s;po&s;ition of this poor ani|mal. If I am thought to dwell too long on the &s;ubject, let it be con&s;ider|ed, that tho&s;e who have mo&s;t unpro|voked enemies, and fewe&s;t friends, clame the greate&s;t pity, and warme&s;t vindication. This reptile has under|gone all &s;orts of &s;candal; one author makes it the companion of an athei&s;t <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A great toad was &s;aid to have been found in the lodgings of <HI>Vanini,</HI> at <HI>Toulou&s;e.

<PB N="332" REF="363">its inmate; in a word, all kind of evil pa&s;&s;ions have been be&s;towed on it: It is but ju&s;tice therefore to &s;ay &s;ome|thing in behalf of an animal that has of late had &s;o many tryals of its temper, from experiments occa&s;ioned by the new di&s;covery of its cancer-&s;ucking quali|ties. It has born all the handling, teiz|ing, bagging, &amp;c. &amp;c. without the le&s;t &s;ign of a vindictive di&s;po&s;ition; but has even made it&s;elf a &s;acrifice to the di&s;charge of its office: this I know from the re&s;ult of much enquiry; would I could contradict what is a&s;&s;erted, p. 10, of the inefficacy of the tryals made of them in the mo&s;t horrible of di&s;ea&s;es; for at this time I my&s;elf cannot bring one proof of the &s;ucce&s;s. But I would not have any one di&s;couraged from the pur&s;uit of the re|medy. Heaven opens to us gradually its favors: the <HI>load&s;tone</HI> was for ages a meer matter of ignorant amaze at its attractive qualities: <HI>mercury</HI> was a &s;up|po&s;ed poi&s;on, and the terror of phy&s;i|cians: we now wonder at the powers of electricity, and are &s;till but partially acquainted with its u&s;es: the toad, the object of horror even in the mo&s;t en|lightened times, is found to be perfectly innocent; it has certainly contributed to the ea&s;e (and as has been &s;aid to the
<PB N="333" REF="364">cure) of the unhappy cancered; let the following facts &s;peak for them&s;elves; they come from per&s;ons of undoubted veracity, and will &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;h the truth of the beneficent qualities of this animal.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t paper relating to it is very ingeniou&s;ly draw up by Mr. <HI>Pitfield,</HI> for the information of Doctor <HI>Littleton,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> (now happy) who immediately honored me with the copy.</P>
<P><HI>Exon, Aug.</HI> 29, 1768.</P>
<Q><P>Your lord&s;hip mu&s;t have taken notice of a paragraph in the papers, with regard to the application of toads to a cancered brea&s;t. A pa|tient of mine has &s;ent to the neigh|borhood of <HI>Hungerford,</HI> and brought down the very woman on whom the cure was done. I have, with all the attention I am capable of, at|tended the operation for eighteen or twenty days, and am &s;urprized at the phaenomenon. I am in no ex|pectation of any great &s;ervice from the application: the age, con&s;titu|tion, and thoroughly cancerous con|dition of the per&s;on, being uncon|querable barriers to it. How an ail of that kind, ab&s;olutely local, in an otherwi&s;e &s;ound habit, and of a
<PB N="334" REF="365">likely age, might be relieved, I can|not &s;ay. But as to the operation, thus much I can a&s;&s;ert, that there is neither pain nor nau&s;eou&s;ne&s;s in it. The animal is put into a linen bag, all but its head, and that is held to the part. It has generally in&s;tantly laid hold of the foule&s;t part of the &s;ore, and &s;ucked with greedine&s;s until it dropped off dead. It has frequently happened that the crea|ture has &s;wolen immen&s;ely, and from its agonies appeared to be in great pain. I have weighed them for &s;everal days together, before and after the application, and found their increa&s;e of weight, in the dif|ferent degrees, from a drachm to near an ounce. They frequently &s;weat exceedingly, and turn quite pale: &s;ometimes they di&s;gorge, reco|ver, and become lively again. I think the whole &s;cene is &s;urpri&s;ing, and a very remarkable piece of natural hi&s;tory. From the con&s;tant inof|fen&s;ivene&s;s which I have ob&s;erved in them, I almo&s;t que&s;tion the truth of their poi&s;onous &s;pitting. Many peo|ple here expect no great good from the application of toads to cancers; and where the di&s;order is not ab&s;o|lutely local, none is to be expected;
<PB N="335" REF="366">where it is, and &s;eated in any part, not to be well come at for extirpa|tion, I think it is hardly to be ima|gined, but that the having it &s;ucked clean as often as you plea&s;e, mu&s;t give great relief. Every body knows, that dogs licking of &s;ores cures them, which is, I &s;uppo&s;e, chiefly by keeping them clean. If there is any credit to be given to hi&s;tory, poi&s;ons have been &s;ucked out, &mdash;<HI>Pallentia Vulnera lambit Ore Venera trahens.</HI> are the words of <HI>Lucan</HI> on the oc|ca&s;ion: if the people to whom the&s;e words are applied, did their cure by immediately following the injection of the poi&s;on, the local confinement of another poi&s;on brings the ca&s;e to a great degree of &s;imilarity.</P>
<P>I hope I have not tired your lord|&s;hip with my long tale, as it is a true one, and in my apprehen&s;ion a curi|ous piece of natural hi&s;tory, I could not forbear communicating it to you. I own I thought the &s;tory in the pa|pers to be an invention, and when I
<PB N="336" REF="367">con&s;idered the in&s;tinctive principle in all animals of &s;elf pre&s;ervation, I was confirmed in my di&s;belief; but what I have related I &s;aw, and all theory mu&s;t yield to fact. It is only the <HI>Rubeta,</HI> the land toad, which has the property of &s;ucking; I can|not find any the le&s;t mention of the property in any one of the old naturali&s;ts. My patient can bear to have but one applied in twenty-four hours: the woman who was cured had them on day and night, with|out intermi&s;&s;ion, for five weeks. Their time of hanging at the brea&s;t has been from one to &s;ix hours.</P></Q>
<P>The other account is of a woman now under the experiment, which I give, as delivered to me from un|doubted authority. If the event is pro&s;perous, an early opportunity &s;hall be taken of informing the public of it in &s;ome of the news-papers, with all circum&s;tances of place, name, &amp;c. which at pre&s;ent it is needle&s;s to men|tion.</P>
<P>About &s;ix years ago a poor woman received a cru&s;h on her brea&s;t by the fall of a pail; a cancerous complaint was the re&s;ult.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="368">La&s;t year her di&s;order increa&s;ed to an alarming degree; &s;he had five wounds on her brea&s;ts, one exceeding large, from which fragments of bone worked out, giving her va&s;t pain; and at the &s;ame time there was a great di&s;charge of thin yellow mat|ter: &s;he was likewi&s;e reduced to a meer &s;keleton.</P>
<P>All her left &s;ide and &s;tomach was much &s;welled; her fingers doughy and di&s;colored.</P>
<P>On the 25th of <HI>September,</HI> 1768, the fir&s;t toad was applied; between that and the 29th &s;he u&s;ed &s;even, and had that night better re&s;t. She &s;wal|lowed with greater ea&s;e, for before that time there was &s;ome appearance of humor in her neck, and a difficulty of getting any thing down.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 16th, the patient better. It was thought proper as winter was coming on, and of cour&s;e it would be very difficult to procure a number of toads, to apply more at a time, &s;o three were put on at once. the &s;wel|ling in the arm abated, and the wo|man's re&s;t was good.</P>
<P>During the&s;e tryals &s;he took an in|fu&s;ion of <HI>Water Par&s;nep</HI> with <HI>Pulvis Cornacchini.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="369"><HI>December</HI> 18th, continued to look ill, but finds her&s;elf better: two of the wounds were now healed.</P>
<P>She was always mo&s;t ea&s;y when the toads were &s;ucking, of which &s;he kil|led va&s;t numbers in the operation.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 1769. The la&s;t account that was received, informing that the patient was better.</P>
<P>The remarks made on the animals, are the&s;e: Some toads died very &s;oon after they had &s;ucked; others lived about a quarter of an hour, but &s;ome lived much longer: for example, one that was applied about &s;even o'clock &s;ucked till ten, and died as &s;oon as it was taken from the brea&s;t; another that immediately &s;ucceeded continued till three o'clock, but dropped dead from the wound, each &s;welled exceedingly, and turned of a pale color.</P>
<P>The&s;e toads did not &s;eem to &s;uck greedily, and would often turn their heads away; but during the time of &s;ucking were heard to &s;mack their lips like a young child.</P>
<P>As tho&s;e reptiles are apt by their &s;truggles to get out of the bag, the open end ought to be made with an open hem, that the &s;tring may run the
<PB N="339" REF="370">more readily, and fa&s;ten tightly about the neck.</P>
<P>It would be improper to quit the &s;ubject without mentioning the ori|gin of this &s;trange di&s;covery, which was owing to a woman near <HI>Hunger|ford,</HI> who labored under a cancerous complaint in her brea&s;t, which had long baffled all applications.</P>
<P>The account &s;he gives of the man|ner in which &s;he came by her know|lege is very &s;ingular, and I may &s;ay apocryphal.
