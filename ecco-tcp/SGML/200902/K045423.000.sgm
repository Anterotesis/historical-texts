<HEAD>THE Two Wealthy Farmers, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IT was mentioned in the la&s;t part of this Hi&s;tory, that the chief rea&s;on which had drawn Mr. Wor|thy to vi&s;it his friend ju&s;t at the pre&s;ent time, was, that Mr. Bragwell had a &s;mall e&s;tate to &s;ell by auction. Mr. Worthy, though he did not think he &s;hould be a bidder, wi&s;hed to be pre&s;ent, as he had bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ettle with one or two per&s;ons who were expected at the Golden Lion on that day, and he had put off this vi&s;it till he had &s;een the &s;ale adveri&s;ed in the County Paper.</P>
<P>Mr. Bragwell and Mr. Worthy &s;et out early on the Monday morning on their way to the Golden Lion, a &s;mall Inn in a neighbouring market town. As they had time before them, they had agreed to ride &s;lowly, that they might conver&s;e on &s;ome u&s;eful
<PB N="4" REF="3">&s;ubject; but here, as u&s;ual, they had two opinions about the &s;ame thing. Mr. Bragwell's notion of an u&s;eful &s;ubject was, &s;omething by which money was to be got, and a good bargain &s;truck. Mr. Wor|thy was no le&s;s a man of bu&s;ine&s;s than his friend. His &s;chemes were wi&s;e, and his calculations ju&s;t; his reputation for integrity and good &s;en&s;e made him the common judge and umpire in his neighbours' affairs, while no one paid a more exact attention to every tran&s;action of his own. But the bu&s;ine&s;s of getting money was not with him the fir&s;t, much le&s;s was it the whole concern of the day. Every morning when he ro&s;e, he remembered that he had a Maker to wor&s;hip as well as a family to maintain. Religion, however, never made him neglect bu&s;i|ne&s;s, though it &s;ometimes led him to po&s;tpone it. He u&s;ed to &s;ay, no man had any rea&s;on to expect God's ble&s;&s;ing through the day who did not a&s;k it in the morning. But he had not the le&s;s &s;en&s;e, &s;pi|rit, and activity when he was among men abroad, becau&s;e he had fir&s;t &s;erved God at home.</P>
<P>As the&s;e two Farmers rode along, Mr. Worthy took occa&s;ion, from the finene&s;s of the day, and the beauty of the country through which they pa&s;&s;ed, to turn the di&s;cour&s;e to the goodne&s;s of God and our infinite obligations to him. He knew that the tran&s;ition from thank&s;giving to prayer would be natural and ea&s;y, and he therefore &s;lid, by degrees, into that important &s;ubject; and he ob&s;erved that &s;ecret prayer was a duty of univer&s;al obligation, which every man had it in his power to fulfil, and which he &s;eriou&s;ly believed was the ground work of all religious practice, and of all devout affections.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">Mr. Bragwell felt con&s;cious that he was very neg|ligent and irregular in the performance of this duty, he con&s;idered it as a mere ceremony, or at lea&s;t as a duty which might give way to the &s;lighte&s;t temptation of drow&s;ine&s;s at night, or of bu&s;ine&s;s in the morning, As he knew he did not live in the con&s;cientious performance of this practice, he tried to ward off the &s;ubject, knowing what a home way his friend had of putting things. At la&s;t he &s;aid, he certainly thought private prayer a good cu&s;tom, e&s;pecially for people who have time, and that tho&s;e who were &s;ick, or old, or out of bu&s;ine&s;s, could not do better, but that, for his part, he believed much of the&s;e &s;ort of things was not expected from men in active life.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould think Mr. Bragwell, that tho&s;e who are mo&s;t expo&s;ed to temptation &s;tand mo&s;t in need of prayer; now there are few methinks who are more expo&s;ed to temptation than men in bu&s;ine&s;s, for tho&s;e mu&s;t be in mo&s;t danger, at lea&s;t from the world, who have mo&s;t to do with it. And if this be true, ought we not to prepare our&s;elves in the clo&s;et for the trials of the market, the field, and the &s;hop?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>For my part, I think example is the whole of Religion, and if the ma&s;ter of a family is orderly, and regular, and goes to church, he does every thing which can be required of him, and no one has a right to call him to account for any thing more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give me leave to &s;ay, Mr. Bragwell
<PB N="6" REF="5">that highly as I rate a good example, &s;till I mu&s;t &s;et a good principle above it. I mu&s;t keep go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d order indeed, for the &s;ake of others; but I mu&s;t keep a good con&s;cience for my own &s;ake. To God I owe &s;ecret piety, I mu&s;t therefore pray to him in private.&mdash;To my family I owe a Chri&s;tian ex|ample, and for that, among other rea&s;ons, I mu&s;t not fail to go to Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are talking, Mr. Worthy, as if I were an enemy to Chri&s;tianity. Sir, I am no Hea|then. Sir, I belong to the Church. I always drink pro&s;perity to the Church. You your&s;elf, as &s;trict as you are, in never mi&s;&s;ing it twice a day, are not a warmer friend to the Church than I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is to &s;ay, you know its value as an in&s;titution, but you do not &s;eem to know that a man may be very irreligious under the be&s;t religious in|&s;titutions; and that even the mo&s;t excellent of them are but <HI>means</HI> of being religious, and are no more religion it&s;elf than brick and mortar are prayers and thank&s;givings. I &s;hall never think, however, high their profe&s;&s;ion, and even however regular their attendance, that tho&s;e men truly re&s;pect the Church, who bring home little of that religion which is taught in it into their own families, or their own hearts. Excu&s;e me, Mr. Bragwell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Worhy, I am per&s;uaded that re|ligion is quite a proper thing for the poor; and I don't think that the multitude can ever be kept in order without it, and I am a bit of a politician you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="6">
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your opinion is very ju&s;t, as far as it goes, but it does not go far enough, &s;ince it does not go to the root of the evil, for while you value your&s;elf on the &s;oundne&s;s of this principle as a politician. I wi&s;h you to &s;ee the rea&s;on of it as a Chri&s;tian; depend upon it, if Religion be good for the community at large, it is equally good for every family; and what is right for a family is equally right for each individual in it. You have therefore your&s;elf brought the mo&s;t unan&s;werable argument why you ought to be religious, by a&s;king how we &s;hall keep others in order without Religion. For, believe me, Mr. Bragwell, there is no parti|cular clau&s;e to except you in the Go&s;pel. No ex|ceptions in favour of any one cla&s;s of men. The &s;ame re&s;traints which are nece&s;&s;ary for the people at large are equally nece&s;&s;ary for men of every order, high and low, rich and poor, bond and free, learned and ignorant. May I a&s;k you, Mr. Brag|well, what is your rea&s;on for going to Church?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I am &s;hocked at your que&s;tion. How can I avoid doing a thing &s;o cu&s;tomary and &s;o creditable? Not go to Church, indeed! What do you take me for, Mr. Worthy? I am afraid you &s;u&s;pect me to be a Papi&s;t, or a Heathen, or of &s;ome religion or other that is not what it &s;hould be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>If a foreigner were to hear how vio|lently one &s;et of Chri&s;tians in this country often &s;peak again&s;t another, how earne&s;t would he &s;uppo&s;e us all to be in religious matters: and how a&s;toni&s;hed to di&s;cover that many a man has perhaps little other proof to give of the &s;incerity of his own religion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="8" REF="7">except the violence with which he hates the religion of another party. It is not <HI>irreligion</HI> which &s;uch men hate, but the religion of the man, or the party, whom they are &s;et again&s;t. Well, you have told me why you go to Church; now pray tell me, why do you confe&s;s there on your bended knees every Sunday, that "you have erred and &s;trayed from God's ways?" "that there is no health in you?" "that you have done what you ought not to do?" "and that you are a mi&s;erable &s;inner?"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell:</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e it is in the Common Prayer Book, to be &s;ure, a book which I have heard you your&s;elf &s;ay was written by wi&s;e and good men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>But have you no other rea&s;on?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I can't &s;ay I have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>When you repeat that excellent form of confe&s;&s;ion, do you really feel that you <HI>are</HI> a mi|&s;erable &s;inner?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I can't &s;ay I do. But that is no objection to my repeating it, becau&s;e it may &s;uit the ca&s;e of many who are &s;o. I &s;uppo&s;e the good Doctors who drew it up intended that part for wicked people only, &s;uch as drunkards, and thieves, and murderers; for I imagine they could not well con|trive to make the &s;ame prayer quite &s;uit an hone&s;t man and a rogue; and &s;o I &s;uppo&s;e they thought it &s;afer to make a good man repeat a prayer which &s;uited a rogue, than to make a rogue repeat a
<PB N="9" REF="8">prayer which &s;uited a good man: and you know it is &s;o cu&s;tomary for every body to repeat the ge|neral confe&s;&s;ion, that it can't hurt the credit of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable per&s;ons, though every one mu&s;t know they have no particular concern in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Depend upon it, Mr. Bragwell, tho&s;e good Doctors you &s;peak of, were not quite of your opinion; they really thought that what you call hone&s;t men were grievous &s;inners in a certain &s;en&s;e, and &s;tood in need of making that humble confe&s;|&s;ion. Mr. Bragwell, do you believe in the fall of Adam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be &s;ure I do, and a &s;ad thing for Adam it was; why, it is in the Bible, is it not? It is one of the prettie&s;t chapters in Gene&s;is. Don't you believe it, Mr. Worthy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, truly I do. But I don't believe it <HI>merely</HI> becau&s;e I read it in Gene&s;is. I know, in|deed, that I am bound to believe every part of the word of God. But I have &s;till an additional rea&s;on for believing in the fall of the fir&s;t man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you, indeed? Now, I can't gue&s;s what that can be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, my own ob&s;ervation of what is within my&s;elf teaches me to believe it. It is not only the third chapter of Gene&s;is which convinces me of the truth of the fall, but al&s;o the &s;inful in|clinations which I find in my own heart. This is
<PB N="10" REF="9">one of tho&s;e leading truths of Chri&s;tianity of which I can never doubt a moment, fir&s;t, becau&s;e it is abundantly expre&s;&s;ed or implied in Scripture; and next, becau&s;e the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the evil nature I carry about with me confirms the doctrine beyond all doubt. Be&s;ides, is it not &s;aid in Scripture that by one man &s;in entered into the world, and that "all we, like &s;heep, have gone a&s;tray; that by one man's di&s;obedience many were made &s;inners," and &s;o again in twenty more places that I could tell you of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I never thought of this. But is not this a very melancholy &s;ort of doctrine, Mr. Worthy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is melancholy, indeed, if we &s;top here. But while we are deploring this &s;ad truth, let us take comfort from another, that "As in Adam all die, &s;o in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I remember I thought tho&s;e very fine words, when I heard them &s;aid over my poor father's grave. But as it was in the Burial of the dead, I did not think of taking it to my&s;elf, for I was then young and hearty, and in little danger of dying, and I have been &s;o bu&s;y ever &s;ince, that I have hardly had time to think of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet the &s;ervice pronounced at the burial of all who die, is a &s;olemn admonition to all who live. It is there &s;aid, as indeed the Scrip|ture
<PB N="11" REF="10">&s;ays al&s;o, "I am the re&s;urrection and the life; who&s;oever <HI>believeth in me</HI> &s;hall never die, but I will rai&s;e him up at the la&s;t day." Now do you think you <HI>believe in Chri&s;t,</HI> Mr. Bragwell?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be &s;ure I do; why, you are always fancying me an Athei&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>In order to believe in Chri&s;t, we mu&s;t believe fir&s;t in our own guilt and our own unwor|thine&s;s, and when we do this we &s;hall &s;ee the u&s;e of a Savior.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, all this is a new way of talking, I can't &s;ay, I ever meddled with &s;uch &s;ubject before in my life. But now, what do you advi&s;e a man to do upon your plan of Religion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, all this leads me back to the ground from which we &s;et out, I mean the duty of prayer; for if we believe that we have an evil na|ture within us, and that we &s;tand in need of Gods grace to help us, and a Saviour to redeem us, we &s;hall be led of cour&s;e to pray for what we &s;o much need.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but don't you think, Mr. Wor|thy, that you good folks who make &s;o much of prayer, have lower notions than we of the wi&s;dom of the Almighty? you think he wants to be in|formed of the things you tell him; whereas, I take for granted that he knows them already, and that, being &s;o good as he is, he will give me every|thing he fees fit to give me without my a&s;king it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="12" REF="11">
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>God, indeed, who knows all things, knows what we want before we a&s;k him, but &s;till has he not &s;aid, that "with prayer and &s;upplica|tion we mu&s;t make known our reque&s;ts unto him." Prayer is the way in which God hath &s;aid that his favour mu&s;t be &s;ought. It is the channel through which he hath declared it is his &s;overeign will and plea&s;ure that his ble&s;&s;ings &s;hould be conveyed to us. What a&s;cends up in prayer de&s;cends again to us in ble&s;&s;ings. It is like the rain which ju&s;t now fell; and which had been drawn up from the ground in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">apours to the clouds before it de&s;cended from them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the earth in that refre&s;hing &s;hower. Be&s;ides, prayer has a good effect on our own minds: it tends to excite a right di&s;po&s;ition towards God in us. But above all, it is the way to get the good things we want. "A&s;k," &s;ays the Scripture, "and ye &s;hall receive."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now that is the very thing which I was going to deny. For the truth is, men don't always get what they a&s;k; I believe if I could get a good crop for a&s;king it I &s;hould pray oftener than I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sometimes Mr. Worthy, men "a&s;k and receive not, becau&s;e they a&s;k ami&s;s." They a&s;k worldly ble&s;&s;ings perhaps when they &s;hould a&s;k &s;piritual ones. Now the latter, which are the good things I &s;poke of, are always granted to tho&s;e who pray to God for them, though the former are not. I have ob&s;erved in the ca&s;e of &s;ome worldly things I have &s;ought for, that the grant of my prayer would have cau&s;ed the mi&s;ery of my life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="13" REF="12">
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet you continue to pray on, I &s;uppo&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly; but then I try to mend as to the object of my prayers. I pray for God's ble&s;&s;ing and favor, which is better than riches.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;eem very earne&s;t on this &s;ubject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>To cut the matter &s;hort, I a&s;k then whether prayer is not po&s;itively commanded in the Go&s;pel. When this is the ca&s;e, we can never di&s;|pute about the nece&s;&s;ity or the duty of a thing, as we may when there is no &s;uch command. Here however let me ju&s;t add al&s;o, that a man's prayers may be turned to no &s;mall u&s;e in the way of di&s;co|vering to him whatever is ami&s;s in his life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>How &s;o, Mr. Worthy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, &s;uppo&s;e now, you were to try your&s;elf by turning into the &s;hape of a prayer every practice in which you allow your&s;elf. For in&s;tance, let the prayer in the morning be a &s;ort of prepara|tion for the deeds of the day, and the prayer at night a &s;ort of ob&s;ervation on tho&s;e deeds. You, Mr. Bragwell, I &s;u&s;pect are a little inclined to covetou&s;ne&s;s, excu&s;e me, Sir. Now &s;uppo&s;e after you have been during a whole day a little too eager to get rich, &s;uppo&s;e, I &s;ay, you were to try how it would &s;ound to beg of God at night on your knees to give you &s;till more money though you have
<PB N="14" REF="13">already &s;o much that you know not what to do with it. Suppo&s;e you were to pray in the morn|ing. O Lord give me more riches, though tho&s;e I have are in &s;nare and temptation to me; and a&s;k him in the &s;ame &s;olemn manner to ble&s;s all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> means you intend to make u&s;e of in the day, to add to your &s;ub&s;tance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Worthy, I have no patience with you for thinking I could be &s;o wicked.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hear me out, Mr. Bragwell, you turned your good nephew, Tom Broad, out of doors you know; you owned to me it was an act of inju&s;tice. Now &s;uppo&s;e on the morning of your doing &s;o you had begged of God in a &s;olemn act of prayer to pro&s;|per the deed of cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion, which you intended to commit. I &s;ee you are &s;hocked at the thought of &s;uch a prayer. Well, then, would not prayer have kept you from committing that wicked action? In &s;hort, what a life mu&s;t that be, no act of which you dare beg God to pro&s;per and ble&s;s. If once you can bring your&s;elf to believe that it is your bounden duty to pray for God's ble&s;&s;ing on your day's work, you will certainly grow careful about pa&s;&s;ing &s;uch a day as you may &s;afely a&s;k his ble&s;&s;ing upon. The remark may be carried to &s;ports, diver&s;ions, company. A man, who once takes up the &s;erious u&s;e of prayer, will &s;oon find him&s;elf obliged to ab&s;tain from &s;uch diver&s;ions, occupations, and &s;ocieties, as he cannot rea&s;onably de&s;ire that God will ble&s;s to him; and thus he will &s;ee him&s;elf compelled to leave off either the prac|tice
<PB N="15" REF="14">or the prayer. Now, Mr. Bragwell, I need not a&s;k you which of the two he that is a real Chri&s;tian will give up.</P>
</SP>
<P>Mr. Bragwell began to feel that he had not the be&s;t of the argument, and was afraid he was making no great figure in the eyes of his friend. Luckily, however, he was relieved from the difficulty into which the nece&s;&s;ity of making &s;ome an&s;wer mu&s;t have brought him, by finding they were come to the end of their little journey; and he never beheld the Bunch of Grapes, which decorated the Sign of the Golden Lion, with more real &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>I refer my readers for the tran&s;actions at the Golden Lion, and for the &s;ad Adventures which afterwards befel Mr. Bragwell's family, to the Fifth Part of the Hi&s;tory of the Two Wealthy Farmers.</P>
