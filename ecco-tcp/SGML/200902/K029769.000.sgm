<P>THE <HI>Captives</HI> are at length relea&s;ed from the theatre, where they have been confined for more than three months; and now they hope to find a &s;anctuary in the clo&s;et. It was the inten|tion of the author, throughout his piece, to make experiment of a &s;tyle and diction, different from what are u&s;ual in modern Tragedy. Over-wrought ornaments, and pompous ver&s;ification, he thought, ill &s;uited to the manners of tho&s;e early times, in which the action of his Tragedy is &s;uppo&s;ed to have pa&s;&s;ed. In a word, he was of opinion, that the language of &s;implicity would be&s;t accord with the &s;ubject and the characters: but whether a plain, intelligible, and unaffected &s;tyle, would be acceptable to the public ta&s;te, was what he had &s;till to learn. The experiment has been made; and the author retires with the &s;atisfaction of having, at lea&s;t, intended well.</P>

<L>But fir&s;t&mdash;are both your pit doors &s;hut, I pray?</L>
<L>Or noi&s;e will drown, my &s;trictures on the play,</L>
<STAGE>Noi&s;e from front boxes opening doors and calling places.</STAGE>
<L>Do you hear&mdash;how very hard my ca&s;e is&mdash;</L>

<L>Your &s;eat, my Lord, is here&mdash;your La'&s;hip's there,</L>
<L>Indeed it quite di&s;tracts both bard and player.</L>
<L>Truce then with your confounded clank of keys,</L>
<L>And tell the&s;e fair di&s;turbers of our ea&s;e,</L>
<L><HI>At church,</HI> perhaps, 'tis no &s;uch mighty crime,</L>

<L>So keep your centres, and my bus'ne&s;s know;</L>
<L>I am a bard, as the&s;e my <HI>Acts</HI> will &s;hew.</L>
<STAGE>Pulling out plays from each coat pocket.</STAGE>
<L>But then the managers&mdash;aye! there's the cur&s;e</L>

<L>AT length our bark has reached the wi&s;hed-for &s;hore,</L>

<L>Clings like th'affrighted &s;ailor to the ma&s;t,</L>
<L>And &s;hudders at the dangers he has pa&s;t.</L>
<L>Dangers indeed&mdash;for who, in times like the&s;e,</L>
<L>Would launch his &s;hip to plough dramatic &s;eas?</L>
<L>Where growling thunders roll, and tempe&s;ts &s;weep</L>
