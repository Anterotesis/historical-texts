<P>On the 7th of March, in the pre&s;ent year 1748, they were of|fered to me for &s;ale, by a tall thin woman, about the age of three&s;core, dre&s;&s;ed in a gown of Bombazine, with a cloak and bonnet of black &s;ilk, both a little the wor&s;e for the wear.&mdash;She cal|led

<HEAD>THE Hi&s;tory and Adventures OF AN ATOM.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The EDITOR's Declaration.</HEAD>
<P>I Nathaniel Peacock, of the pari&s;h of St. Giles, haberda&s;her and author, &s;olemnly declare, That on the third of la&s;t Augu&s;t, &s;itting alone in my &s;tudy, up three pair of &s;tairs, between the hours of eleven and twelve at night, meditating upon the uncertainty of &s;ublunary enjoyment, I heard a &s;hrill, &s;mall voice, &s;eeming|ly proceeding from a chink or crevice in my own pericranium, call di&s;tinct|ly three times, <Q REND="inline">"Nathaniel Peacock, Nathaniel Peacock, Nathaniel Pea|cock."</Q>
<PB N="2" REF="7">
A&s;toni&s;hed, yea, even affright|ed, at this citation, I replied in a faultering tone, <Q REND="inline">"In the name of the Lord, what art thou?"</Q> Thus adjured, the voice an&s;wered and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I am an atom."</Q> I was now thrown into a violent perturbation of &s;pirit; for I never could behold an atomy without fear and trembling, even when I knew it was no more than a compo&s;ition of dry bones; but the conceit of being in pre&s;ence of an atomy informed with &s;pirit, that is, animated by a gho&s;t or goblin, increa&s;ed my terrors exceedingly. I dur&s;t not lift up mine eyes, le&s;t I &s;hould behold an appari|tion more dreadful than the hand|writing on the wall. My knees knocked together: my teeth chatter|ed: mine hair bri&s;tled up &s;o as to rai&s;e a cotton night-cap from the &s;calp: my tongue cleaved to the roof of my mouth: my temples were be|dewed with a cold &s;weat.&mdash;Verily, I was for a &s;ea&s;on entranced.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="8">
At length, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, I recollected my&s;elf, and cried aloud, <Q REND="inline">"Avaunt Satan, in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t."</Q>  <Q REND="inline">"White-livered caitiff!</Q> &s;aid the voice, (with a peculiar tartne&s;s of pronunciation) what art thou afraid of, that thou &s;houlde&s;t thus tremble, and diffu&s;e around thee &s;uch an un&s;avoury odour?&mdash;What thou heare&s;t is within thee&mdash;is part of thy&s;elf. I am one of tho&s;e atoms, or con&s;tituent particles of matter, which can neither be an|nihilated, divided, nor impaired: the different arrangements of us atoms compo&s;e all the variety of objects and e&s;&s;ences which nature exhibits, or art can obtain. Of the &s;ame &s;hape, &s;ub|&s;tance, and quality, are the compo|nent particles, that harden in rock, and flow in water; that blacken in the negro, and brighten in the dia|mond; that exhale from a ro&s;e, and &s;team from a dunghill. Even now, ten millions of atoms were di&s;per&s;ed
<PB N="4" REF="9">
in air by that odoriferous gale, which the commotion of thy fear produced; and I can fore&s;ee that one of them will be con&s;olidated in a fibre of the olfactory nerve, belonging to a cele|brated beauty, who&s;e no&s;tril is exco|riated by the immoderate u&s;e of plain Spani&s;h. Know, Nathaniel, that we atoms are &s;ingly endued with &s;uch efficacy of rea&s;on, as cannot be ex|pected in an aggregate body, where we croud and &s;queeze and embarra&s;s one another. Yet, tho&s;e ideas which we &s;ingly po&s;&s;e&s;s, we cannot communicate, except once in a thou&s;and years, and then only, when we fill a certain place in the pineal gland of a human creature, the very &s;tation which I now main|tain in thine.&mdash;For the benefit of you mi&s;erable mortals, I am determined to promulge the hi&s;tory of one pe|riod, during which I underwent &s;ome &s;trange revolutions in the empire of Japan, and was con&s;cious of &s;ome political anecdotes now to be divulg|ed
<PB N="5" REF="10">
for the in&s;truction of Briti&s;h mi|ni&s;ters. Take up the pen, therefore, and write what I &s;hall unfold.</P>
<P>By this time my fir&s;t apprehen&s;ion vani&s;hed; but another fear, almo&s;t as terrible, u&s;urped its place. I began to think my&s;elf in&s;ane, and concluded that the voice was no other than the fanta&s;tic undulation of a di&s;turbed brain. I therefore preferred an ear|ne&s;t ori&s;on at the throne of grace, that I might be re&s;tored to the fruition of my right under&s;tanding and judg|ment. <Q REND="inline">"O incredulous wretch, (ex|claimed the voice,) I will now con|vince thee that this is no phanta&s;ma or hideous dream.&mdash;An&s;wer me, do&s;t thou know the meaning and deriva|tion of the word atom?"</Q> I replied, <Q REND="inline">"No, verily!"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Then I will tell thee, (&s;aid the voice) thou &s;halt write it down without delay, and con&s;ult the curate of the pari&s;h on the &s;ame &s;ub|ject. If his explanation and mine agree, thou will then be firmly per|&s;uaded
<PB N="6" REF="11">
that I am an actual, indepen|dent exi&s;tence; and that this addre&s;s is not the vague delirium of a di&s;or|dered brain. <HI>Atomos</HI> is a Greek word, &s;ignifying an indivi&s;ible particle, de|rived from <HI>alpha</HI> privativa, and <HI>temno</HI> to cut."</Q></P>
<P>I marvelled much at this injunc|tion, which, however, I literally obey|ed; and next morning &s;allied forth to vi&s;it the habitation of the curate; but in going thither, it was my hap to encounter a learned phy&s;ician of my acquaintance, who hath read all the books that ever were publi&s;hed in any nation, or language: to him I refer|ed for the derivation of the word atom. He pau&s;ed a little, threw up his eyes to heaven, &s;troaked his chin with great &s;olemnity, and hemming three times, <Q REND="inline">"Greek, Sir, (&s;aid he) is more familiar to me than my na|tive tongue.&mdash;I have conver&s;ed, Sir, with Homer and Plato, He&s;iod and Theophra&s;tus, Herodotus, Thucydi|des,
<PB N="7" REF="12">
Hippocrates, Aretaeus, Pindar, and Sophocles, and all the poets and hi&s;torians of antiquity. Sir, my libra|ry co&s;t me two thou&s;and pounds. I have &s;pent as much more in making experiments; and you mu&s;t know that I have di&s;covered certain chemi|cal &s;pecifics, which I would not di|vulge for fifty times the &s;um.&mdash;As for the word <HI>atomos,</HI> or <HI>atime,</HI> it &s;ignifies a &s;coundrel, Sir, or as it were, Sir, a thing of no e&s;timation. It is derived, Sir, from <HI>alpha</HI> privativa, and <HI>time,</HI> honour. Hence, we call a &s;keleton an atomy, becau&s;e, Sir, the bones are, as it were, di&s;honoured by being &s;tripped of their cloathing, and expo&s;ed in their nakedne&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>I was &s;orely vexed at this inter|pretation, and my apprehen&s;ion of lunacy recurred: neverthele&s;s, I pro|ceeded in my way to the lodgings of the curate, and de&s;ired his explana|tion, which tallied exactly with what I had written. At my return to my
<PB N="8" REF="13">
own hou&s;e, I a&s;cended to my &s;tudy, a&s;ked pardon of my internal monitor; and taking pen, ink, and paper, &s;at down to write what it dictated, in the following &s;train.</P>
<P>"It was in the aera of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The hi&s;tory of Japan is divided into three different aeras, of which Foggien is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable.</NOTE> Foggien, one thou&s;and years ago, that fate de|termined I &s;hould exi&s;t in the empire of Japan, where I underwent a great number of vici&s;&s;itudes, till, at length, I was enclo&s;ed in a grain of rice, eaten by a Dutch mariner at Firando, and, becoming a particle of his body, brought to the Cape of Good Hope. There I was di&s;charged in a &s;corbutic dy&s;entery, taken up in a heap of &s;oil to manure a garden, rai&s;ed to vege|tation in a &s;allad, devoured by an Engli&s;h &s;upercargo, a&s;&s;imilated to a certain organ of his body, which, at his return to London, being di&s;ea&s;ed in con&s;equence of impure contact, I
<PB N="9" REF="14">
was again &s;eparated, with a con&s;ider|able portion of putrefied fle&s;h, thrown upon a dunghill, gobbled up, and di|ge&s;ted by a duck, of which duck your father, Ephraim Peacock, having eaten plentifully at a fea&s;t of the cordwainers, I was mixed with his circulating juices, and finally fixed in the principal part of that animalcule, which, in proce&s;s of time, expanded it&s;elf into thee, Nathaniel Peacock.</P>
<P>Having thus particularized my tran&s;migrations &s;ince my conveyance from Japan, I &s;hall return thither, and unfold &s;ome curious particulars of &s;tate-intrigue, carried on during the &s;hort period, the hi&s;tory of which I mean to record: I need not tell thee, that the empire of Japan con&s;i&s;ts of three large i&s;lands; or that the peo|ple, who inhabit them, are &s;uch in|con&s;i&s;tent, capricious animals, that one would imagine they were created for the purpo&s;e of ridicule. Their minds are in continual agitation, like a &s;hut|tlecock
<PB N="10" REF="15">
to&s;&s;ed to and fro, in order to divert the demons of philo&s;ophy and folly. A Japone&s;e, without the in|tervention of any vi&s;ible motive, is, by turns, merry and pen&s;ive, &s;uper|ficial and profound, generous and il|liberal, ra&s;h and circum&s;pect, cour|ageous and fearful, benevolent and cruel. They &s;eem to have no fixed principle of action, no certain plan of conduct, no effectual rudder to &s;teer them through the voyage of life; but to be hurried down the rapid tide of each revolving whim, or driven, the &s;port of every gu&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion that happens to blow. A Japone&s;e will &s;ing at a funeral, and &s;igh at a wed|ding; he will this hour talk ribaldry with a pro&s;titute, and the next im|mer&s;e him&s;elf in the &s;tudy of meta|phy&s;ics or theology. In favour of one &s;tranger, he will exert all the virtues of ho&s;pitality; again&s;t another he will exerci&s;e all the animo&s;ity of the mo&s;t &s;ordid prejudice: one minute &s;ees him
<PB N="11" REF="16">
hazarding his all on the &s;ucce&s;s of the mo&s;t extravagant project; another beholds him he&s;itating in lending a few copans<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Copan is a gold coin u&s;ed in Japan, value about 43 &s;hillings.</NOTE> to his friend on unde|niable &s;ecurity. To-day, he is afraid of paring his corns; to-morrow, he &s;cruples not to cut his own throat. At one &s;ea&s;on, he will give half his for|tune to the poor; at another, he will not be&s;tow the &s;malle&s;t pittance to &s;ave his brother from indigence and di&s;tre&s;s. He is elated to in&s;olence by the lea&s;t gleam of &s;ucce&s;s; he is de|jected to de&s;pondence by the &s;lighte&s;t turn of adver&s;e fortune. One hour he doubts the be&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed truths; the next, he &s;wallows the mo&s;timpro|bable fiction. His prai&s;e and his cen&s;ure is what a wi&s;e man would choo&s;e to avoid, as evils equally per|nicious: the fir&s;t is generally rai&s;ed without foundation, and carried to &s;uch extravagance, as to expo&s;e the
<PB N="12" REF="17">
object to the ridicule of mankind; the la&s;t is often unprovoked, yet u&s;ually inflamed to all the rage of the mo&s;t malignant per&s;ecution. He will extol above Alexander the great, a petty officer who robs a hen-roo&s;t; and damn to infamy, a general for not performing impo&s;&s;ibilities. The &s;ame man whom he ye&s;terday flattered with the mo&s;t ful&s;ome adulation, he will to-morrow revile with the mo&s;t bitter abu&s;e; and, at the turning of a &s;traw, take into his bo&s;om the very per&s;on whom he has formerly defamed as the mo&s;t perfidious ra&s;cal.</P>
<P>The Japane&s;e value them&s;elves much upon their con&s;titution, and are very clamorous about the words liberty and property; yet, in fact, the only liberty they enjoy is to get drunk whenever they plea&s;e, to revile the government, and quarrel with one another. With re&s;pect to their pro|perty, they are the tame&s;t animals in the world; and, if properly managed,
<PB N="13" REF="18">
undergo, without wincing, &s;uch impo|&s;itions, as no other nation in the world would bear. In this particular, they may be compared to an a&s;s, that will crouch under the mo&s;t uncon&s;cion|able burthen, provided you &s;cratch his long ears, and allow him to bray his belly-full. They are &s;o practica|ble, that they have &s;uffered their pockets to be drained, their veins to be emptied, and their credit to be cracked, by the mo&s;t bungling ad|mini&s;trations, to gratify the avarice, pride, and ambition, of the mo&s;t &s;or|did and contemptible &s;overeigns, that ever &s;ate upon the throne.</P>
<P>The methods u&s;ed for accompli&s;h|ing the&s;e purpo&s;es are extremely &s;im|ple. You have &s;een a dancing bear incen&s;ed to a dangerous degree of rage, and all at once appea&s;ed by firing a pi&s;tol over his no&s;e. The Japone&s;e, even in their mo&s;t ferocious moods, when they denounce vengeance again&s;t the Cuboy, or mini&s;ter, and even
<PB N="14" REF="19">
threaten the throne it&s;elf; are ea&s;ily &s;oftened into meekne&s;s and conde|&s;cen&s;ion. A &s;et of tall fellows, hired for the purpo&s;e, tickle them under the no&s;es with long &s;traws, into a gentle convul&s;ion, during which they &s;hut their eyes, and &s;mile, and quietly &s;uf|fer their pockets to be turned in&s;ide out. Nay, what is &s;till more remark|able, the mini&s;try is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a pipe, or rather bullocks's horn, which being &s;ounded to a particular pitch, has &s;uch an effect on the ears and under&s;tanding of the people, that they allow their pockets to be picked with their eyes open, and are bribed to be|tray their own intere&s;t with their own money, as ea&s;ily as if the trea&s;ure had come from the remote&s;t corner of the globe. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e capricious peculiarities, the Japone&s;e are become a wealthy and powerful people, partly from their in&s;ular &s;i|tuation, and partly from a &s;pirit of commercial adventure, &s;u&s;tained by
<PB N="15" REF="20">
all the ob&s;tinacy of per&s;everance, and conducted by repeated fla&s;hes of good &s;en&s;e, which almo&s;t ince&s;&s;antly gleam through the chaos of their ab&s;urdities.</P>
<P>Japan was originally governed by monarchs who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an ab&s;olute power, and &s;ucceeded by hereditary right, under the title of Dairo. But in the beginning of the period Fog|gien, this emperor became a cypher, and the whole admini&s;tration devolv|ed into the hands of the prime mi|ni&s;ter, or Cuboy, who now exerci&s;es all the power and authority, leaving the trappings of royalty to the inactive Dairo. The prince, who held the reins of government in the &s;hort pe|riod which I intend to record, was not a lineal de&s;cendant of the antient Dairos, the immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ion having &s;ailed, but &s;prung from a col|lateral branch which was invited from a foreign country in the per&s;on of <HI>Bupo,</HI> in honour of whom the Ja|pone&s;e erected Fakkuba&s;i<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Kempfer, Lib. i.</NOTE>, or the
<PB N="16" REF="21">
temple of the white hor&s;e. So much were all his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors devoted to the culture of this idol, which, by the bye, was made of the vile&s;t materials, that, in order to enrich his &s;hrine, they impoveri&s;hed the whole empire, yet &s;till with the connivance, and by the influence of the Cuboy, who gra|tified this &s;ordid pa&s;&s;ion or &s;uper&s;ti|tion of the Dairo, with a view to prevent him from employing his at|tention on matters of greater con&s;e|quence.</P>
<P>Nathaniel, You have heard of the tran&s;migration of &s;ouls, a doctrine avowed by one Pythagoras, a philo|&s;opher of Crotona. This doctrine, though di&s;carded and reprobated by chri&s;tians, is neverthele&s;s &s;ound, and orthodox, I affirm on the integrity of an atom. Further I &s;hall not explain my&s;elf on this &s;ubject, though I might with &s;afety &s;et the convocation and the whole hierarchy at defiance, knowing, as I do, that it is not in their
<PB N="17" REF="22">
power to make me bate one particle of what I advance: or, if they &s;hould endeavour to reach me through your organs, and even condemn you to the &s;take at Smithfield, verily, I &s;ay unto thee, I &s;hould be a gainer by the next remove. I &s;hould &s;hift my quarters from a very cold and empty tenement, which I now occupy in the brain of a poor haberda&s;her, to the nervous ple|xus &s;ituated at the mouth of the &s;to|mach of a fat aldermand fed with ve|ni&s;on and turtle.</P>
<P>But to return to Pythagoras, whom one of your wi&s;e countrymen deno|minated <HI>Peter Gore, the wi&s;e-acre</HI> of Croton, you mu&s;t know that philo|&s;opher was a type, which hath not yet been fully unveiled. That he taught the metemp&s;ycho&s;is, explained the nature and property of harmonies, demon&s;trated the motion of the earth, di&s;covered the elements of geometry and arithmetic, enjoined his di&s;ciples &s;ilence, and ab&s;tained from eating
<PB N="18" REF="23">
any thing that was ever informed by the breath of life; are circum&s;tances known to all the learned world: but his veneration for beans, which co&s;t him his life, his golden thigh, his ad|ventures in the character of a cour|tezan, his golden ver&s;es, his epithet of <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, the fable of his being born of a virgin, and his de&s;cent into hell, are my&s;teries in which &s;ome of the mo&s;t important truths are con|cealed.&mdash;Between friends, hone&s;t Na|thaniel, I my&s;elf con&s;tituted part of that &s;age's body; and I could &s;ay a great deal&mdash;but there is a time for all things.&mdash;I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that Philip Te&s;&s;ier had &s;ome rea&s;on for &s;up|po&s;ing Pythagoras to have been a monk; and there are &s;hrewd hints in Meyer's di&s;&s;ertation, <HI>Utrum Pytha|goras Judaeus fuit, an monachus Car|melita.</HI></P>
<P>Waving the&s;e intricate di&s;cu&s;&s;ions for the pre&s;ent, (though I cannot help di&s;clo&s;ing that Pythagoras was actually
<PB N="19" REF="24">
circumci&s;ed) know, Peacock, that the metemp&s;ycho&s;is, or tran&s;migration of &s;ouls, is the method which nature and fate con&s;tantly pur&s;ue, in animating the creatures produced on the face of the earth; and this proce&s;s, with &s;ome variation, is &s;uch as the eleu&s;inian my&s;teries imported, and &s;uch as you have read in Dryden's tran&s;lation of the &s;ixth book of Virgil's Aeneid. The Gods have provided a great magazine or diver&s;orium, to which the departed &s;ouls of all animals repair at their di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion from the body. Here they are bathed in the waters of obli|vion, until they retain no memory of the &s;cenes through which they have pa&s;&s;ed; but they &s;till pre&s;erve their original cra&s;is and capacity. From this repo&s;itory, all new created be|ings are &s;upplied with &s;ouls; and the&s;e &s;ouls tran&s;migrate into different animals, according to the plea&s;ure of the great di&s;po&s;er. For example, my good friend Nathaniel Peacock, your
<PB N="20" REF="25">
own &s;oul has within the&s;e hundred years threaded a goat, a &s;pider, and a bi&s;hop; and its next &s;tage will be the carca&s;e of a brewer's hor&s;e.</P>
<P>In what manner we atoms come by the&s;e articles of intelligence, whe|ther by intuition, or communication of ideas, it is not nece&s;&s;ary that you &s;hould conceive&mdash;Suffice it to &s;ay, the gods were merry on the follies of mankind, and Mercury undertook to exhibit a mighty nation, ruled and governed by the meane&s;t intellects that could be found in the repo&s;itory of pre-exi&s;ting &s;pirits. He laid the &s;cene in Japan, about the middle of the period Foggien, when that nation was at peace with all her neighbours. Into the ma&s;s, de&s;tined to &s;way the &s;ceptre, he infu&s;ed, at the very article of con|ception, the &s;pirit, which in cour&s;e of &s;trangulation had been expelled <HI>a po&s;|teriori</HI> from a goo&s;e, killed on purpo&s;e to regale the appetite of the mother. The animalcule, thus in&s;pired, was
<PB N="21" REF="26">
born, and &s;ucceeded to the throne, under the name of Got-hama-baba. His whole life and conver&s;ation was no other than a repetition of the hu|mours he had di&s;played in his la&s;t cha|racter. He was rapacious, &s;hallow, hot|headed, and perver&s;e; in point of un|der&s;tanding, ju&s;t &s;ufficient to appear in public without a &s;iavering bib; im|bued with no knowledge, illumed by no &s;entiment, and warmed with no affection; except a blind attachment to the wor&s;hip of Fakku-ba&s;i, which &s;eemed indeed to be a di&s;ea&s;e in his con&s;titution.

<P>Of all his recreations, that which he delighted in mo&s;t, was kicking the breech of his Cuboy, or prime mini&s;ter, an exerci&s;e which he every day per|formed in private.

fore&s;een and provided for by Mercury, who, a little after the con|ception of Got-hama-baba, impreg|nated the ovum of a future Cuboy, and implanted in it a changling &s;oul, which had &s;ucce&s;&s;ively pa&s;&s;ed through the bodies of an a&s;s, a dottril, an apple-woman, and a cow-boy. It was diverting enough to &s;ee the re|joicings with which the birth of this Quanbuku<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quanbuku is a dignity of the fir&s;t order in Japan.</NOTE> was celebrated; and &s;till more &s;o to ob&s;erve the marks of fond admiration in the parents, as the &s;oul of the cow-boy proceeded to ex|pand it&s;elf in the young Cuboy. This is a &s;pecies of diver&s;ion we atoms of|ten enjoy. We at different times be|hold the &s;ame &s;pirit, hunted down in a hare, and cried up in an Hector; fawning in a pro&s;titute, and bribing in a mini&s;ter; breaking forth in a whi&s;tle at the plough, and in a &s;ermon from the pulpit; impelling a hog to

<P>Tutors of all &s;orts were provided betimes for the young Quanbuku, but his genius rejected all cultivation; at lea&s;t the crops it produced were barren and ungrateful. He was di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the name of Fika-kaka, and care&s;&s;ed as the heir of an im|men&s;e fortune. Nay, he was really con&s;idered as one of the mo&s;t hopeful young Quanbukus in the empire of Japan; for his want of ideas was at|tended with a total ab&s;ence of pride, in&s;olence, or any other di&s;agreeable vice: indeed his character was found|ed upon negatives. He had no un|der&s;tanding, no oeconomy, no cour|age, no indu&s;try, no &s;teadine&s;s, no di&s;cernment, no vigour, no retention. He was reputed generous and good-humoured; but was really profu&s;e, chicken-hearted, negligent, fickle,

blundering, weak, and leaky. All the&s;e qualifications were agitated by an eagerne&s;s, ha&s;te, and impatience, that compleated the mo&s;t ludicrous compo&s;ition, which human nature ever produced. He appeared always in hurry and confu&s;ion, as if he had lo&s;t his wits in the morning, and was in que&s;t of them all day.&mdash;Let me whi&s;per a &s;ecret to you, my good friend Peacock. All this bu&s;tle and trepi|dation proceeded from a hollowne&s;s in the brain, forming a kind of eddy, in which his animal &s;pirits were hur|ried about in a perpetual &s;wirl. Had it not been for this <HI>Lu&s;us Naturoe,</HI> the circulation would not have been &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;es of animal life. Had the whole world been &s;earched by the princes thereof, it would not have produced another to have matched this half-witted origi|nal, to whom the admini&s;tration of a mighty empire was wholly con&s;igned. Notwith&s;tanding all the care that was

taken of his education, Fika-kaka never could comprehend any art or &s;cience, except that of dancing bare|headed among the Bonzas at the great fe&s;tival of Cambadoxi. The extent of his knowledge in arithmetic went no farther than the numeration of his ten fingers. In hi&s;tory, he had no idea of what preceded a certain treaty with the Chine&s;e, in the reign of queen Syko, who died within his own remembrance; and was &s;o ignorant of geography, that he did not know that his native country was &s;urround|ed by the &s;ea. No &s;y&s;tem of mora|lity could he ever under&s;tand; and of the fourteen &s;ects of religion that are permitted in Japan, the only di&s;|cipline he could imbibe was a &s;uper|&s;titious devotion for Fakku-ba&s;i, the temple of the white hor&s;e. This, indeed, was neither the fruit of doc|trine, nor the re&s;ult of rea&s;on; but a real in&s;tinct, implanted in his nature
<PB N="26" REF="31">
for fulfilling the ends of providence. His per&s;on was extremely aukward; his eye vacant, though alarmed; his &s;peech thick, and embarra&s;&s;ed; his utterance ungraceful; and his mean|ing perplexed. With much difficul|ty he learned to write his own name, and that of the Dairo; and picked up a &s;mattering of the Chine&s;e language, which was &s;ometimes u&s;ed at court. In his youth, he freely conver&s;ed with women; but, as he advanced in age, he placed his chief felicity in the de|lights of the table. He hired cooks from China at an enormous expence, and drank huge quantities of the &s;trong liquor di&s;tilled from rice, which, by producing repeated intoxication, had an unlucky effect upon his brain, that was naturally of a loo&s;e flim&s;y tex|ture. The immoderate u&s;e of this potation was likewi&s;e &s;aid to have greatly impaired his retentive faculty; ina&s;much as he was &s;ubject upon every
<PB N="27" REF="32">
extraordinary emotion of &s;pirit, to an involuntary di&s;charge from the la&s;t of the inte&s;tines.</P>
<P>Such was the character of Fika-kaka, entitled by his birth to a pro|digious e&s;tate, as well as to the ho|nours of Quanbuku, the fir&s;t heredi|tary dignity in the empire. In con|&s;equence of his high &s;tation, he was connected with all the great men in Japan, and u&s;ed to the court from his infancy. Here it was he became ac|quainted with young Got-hama-baba, his future &s;overeign; and their &s;ouls being congenial, they &s;oon contracted an intimacy, which endured for life. They were like twin particles of mat|ter, which having been divorced from one another by a mo&s;t violent &s;hock, had floated many thou&s;and years in the ocean of the univer&s;e, till at length meeting by accident, and approaching within the &s;pheres of each other's at|traction, they ru&s;h together with an
<PB N="28" REF="33">
eager embrace, and continue united ever after.</P>
<P>The favour of the &s;overeign, added to the natural influence ari&s;ing from a va&s;t fortune and great alliances, did not fail to elevate Fika-kaka to the mo&s;t eminent offices of the &s;tate, un|til, at length, he attained to the dig|nity of Cuboy, or chief-mini&s;ter, which virtually comprehends all the re&s;t. Here then was the &s;trange&s;t phaenomenon that ever appeared in the political world. A &s;tate&s;man without capacity, or the &s;malle&s;t tincture of human learning; a &s;ecre|tary who could not write; a financier who did not under&s;tand the multipli|cation table; and the trea&s;urer of a va&s;t empire, who never could balance accounts with his own butler.</P>
<P>He was no &s;ooner, for the diver&s;ion of the Gods, promoted to the Cuboy|&s;hip, than his vanity was pampered with all &s;orts of adulation. He was
<PB N="29" REF="34">
in magnificence extolled above the fir&s;t Meckaddo, or line of emperors, to whom divine honours had been paid; equal in wi&s;dom to Ten&s;io-dai-&s;in, the fir&s;t founder of the Japane&s;e monar|chy; braver than Whey-vang, of the dyna&s;ty of Chew; more learned than Jacko, the chief pontiff of Japan; more liberal than Shi-wang-ti, who was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the univer&s;al medi|cine; and more religious than <HI>Bupo,</HI> alias <HI>Kobot,</HI> who, from a foreign coun|try, brought with him, on a white hor&s;e, a book called Kio, containing the my&s;teries of his religion.</P>
<P>But, by none was he more cultivated than by the Bonzas or clergy, e&s;peci|ally tho&s;e of the univer&s;ity Frenoxe|na<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Hi&s;t. Eccle&s;. Japan. Vol. I.</NOTE>, &s;o renowned for their learning, &s;ermons, and oratory, who actually cho&s;e him their &s;upreme director, and every morning adored him with a very &s;ingular rite of wor&s;hip. This attach|ment was the more remarkable, as
<PB N="30" REF="35">
Fika-kaha was known to favour the &s;ect of Nem-buds-ju, who di&s;tingui&s;h|ed them&s;elves by the ceremony of cir|cumci&s;ion. Some malicious people did not &s;cruple to whi&s;per about, that he him&s;elf had privately undergone the operation: but the&s;e, to my cer|tain knowledge, were the &s;ugge&s;tions of fal&s;hood and &s;lander. A &s;light &s;carification, indeed, it was once ne|ce&s;&s;ary to make, on account of his health; but this was no ceremony of any religious wor&s;hip. The truth was this. The Nem-buds-ju, being few in number, and generally hated by the whole nation, had recour&s;e to the protection of Fika-kaka, which they obtained for a valuable con&s;ideration. Then a law was promulgated in their favour; a &s;tep which was &s;o far from exciting the jealou&s;y of the Bonzas, that there was not above three, out of one hundred and fifty-nine thou&s;and, that opened their lips in di&s;approbation of the mea&s;ure. Such were the virtue
<PB N="31" REF="36">
and moderation of the Bonzas, and &s;o loth were they to di&s;oblige their great director Fika-kaka.</P>
<P>What rendered the knot of con|nection between the Dairo Got-ha|ma-baba, and this Cuboy altogether indi&s;&s;oluble, was a &s;ingular circum|&s;tance, which I &s;hall now explain. Fika-kika not only devoted him&s;elf intirely to the gratification of his ma&s;ter's prejudices and rapacity, even when they interfered the mo&s;t with the intere&s;t and reputation of Japan; but he al&s;o &s;ubmitted per&s;onally to his capricious humours with the mo&s;t placid re&s;ignation. He pre|&s;ented his po&s;teriors to be kicked as regularly as the day revolved; and pre&s;ented them not barely with &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, but with all the appearance of fond de&s;ire: and truly this diur|nal expo&s;ure was attended with &s;uch delectation as he never enjoyed in any other attitude.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="37">
To explain this matter, I mu&s;t tell thee, Peacock, that Fika-kaka was from his infancy afflicted with an itching of the podex, which the learn|ed Dr. Woodward would have term|ed <HI>immanis</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>pruritus.</HI> That great naturali&s;t would have imputed it to a redundancy of cholicky &s;alts, got out of the &s;tomach and guts into the blood, and thrown upon the&s;e parts, and he would have attempted to break their colluctations with oil, &amp;c. but I, who know the real cau&s;es of this di&s;|order, &s;mile at the&s;e whims of phi|lo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>Be that as it may, certain it is, all the mo&s;t eminent phy&s;icians in Japan were con&s;ulted about this &s;trange tickling and tingling, and among the&s;e the celebrated Fan-&s;ey, who&s;e &s;pirit afterwards informed the body of Rabelais. This experienced leech, having pre&s;cribed a cour&s;e of cathar|tics, bal&s;amics, and &s;weeteners, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the blood was
<PB N="33" REF="38">
tainted with a &s;corbutical itch; at length found rea&s;on to believe that the di&s;ea&s;e was local. He therefore tried the method of gentle friction: for which purpo&s;e he u&s;ed almo&s;t the very &s;ame &s;ub&s;tances which were many centuries after applied by Gargantua to his own po&s;teriors; &s;uch as a night cap, a pillow-bier, a &s;lipper, a poke, a pannier, a beaver, a hen, a cock, a chicken, a calf-&s;kin, a hare-&s;kin, a pi|geon, a cormorant, a lawyer's bag, a lamprey, a coif, a lure, nay even a goo&s;e's neck, without finding that <HI>volupt&eacute; merifique au trou de cul,</HI> which was the portion of the &s;on of Gran|gou&s;ier. In &s;hort, there was nothing that gave Fika-kaka &s;uch re&s;pite from this tormenting titillation as did &s;mearing the parts with thick cream, which was afterwards licked up by the rough tongue of a boar|cat. But the admini&s;tration of this remedy was once productive of a di&s;|agreeable incident. In the mean
<PB N="34" REF="39">
time, the di&s;temper gaining ground became &s;o trouble&s;ome, that the un|fortunate Quanbuku was ince&s;&s;antly in the fidgets, and ran about di&s;tract|ed, cackling like a hen in labour.</P>
<P>The &s;ource of all this misfortune was the juxta po&s;ition of two atoms quarrelling for precedency, in this the Cuboy's &s;eat of honour. Their pre&s;&s;ing and &s;queezing and elbowing and jo&s;t|ling, tho' of no effect in di&s;compo&s;ing one another, occa&s;ioned all this irrita|tion and titillation in the po&s;teriors of Fika-kaka&mdash;What! do&s;t thou mutter, Peacock? do&s;t thou pre&s;ume to que&s;|tion my veracity? now by the indivi|&s;ible rotundity of an atom, I have a good mind, caitiff, to rai&s;e &s;uch a buzzing commotion in thy glandula pinealis, that thou &s;halt run di&s;tracted over the face of the earth, like Io when &s;he was &s;tung by Juno's gad|fly! What! thou who ha&s;t been wrapt from the cradle in vi&s;ions of my&s;tery and revelation, &s;wallowed
<PB N="35" REF="40">
impo&s;&s;ibilities like lamb's wool, and dige&s;ted doctrines harder than iron three times quenched in the Ebro! thou to demur at what I a&s;&s;ert upon the evidence and faith of my own con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s and con&s;i&s;tency!&mdash;Oh! you capitulate: well, then beware of a relap&s;e&mdash;you know a relap&s;ed here|tic finds no mercy.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, while Fika-kaka's podex was the &s;cene of contention between two turbulent atoms, I had the ho|nour to be po&s;ted immediately under the nail of the Dairo's great toe, which happened one day to itch more than u&s;ual for occupation. The Cuboy pre&s;enting him&s;elf at that in|&s;tant, and turning his face from his ma&s;ter, Got-hama-baba performed the exerci&s;e with &s;uch uncommon vehemence, that fir&s;t his &s;lipper, and then his toe-nail flew off, after hav|ing made a &s;mall breach in the peri|neum of Fika-kaka. By the &s;ame effort, I was divorced from the great
<PB N="36" REF="41">
toe of the &s;overeign, and lodged near the great gut of his mini&s;ter, exactly in the inter&s;tice between the two ho&s;|tile particles, which were thus in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;trained from wran|gling; though it was not in my power to keep the peace entirely. Never|thele&s;s, Fika-kaka's torture was im|mediately &s;u&s;pended; and he was even &s;eized with an orga&s;m of plea|&s;ure, analogous to that which cha|racteri&s;es the extacy of love.</P>
<P>Think not, however, Peacock, that I would adduce this circum|&s;tance as a proof that plea&s;ure and pain are meer relations, which can exi&s;t only as they are contra&s;ted. No: plea&s;ure and pain are &s;imple, independent ideas, incapable of defi|nition; and this which Fika-kaka felt was an extacy compounded of po&s;itive plea&s;ure ingra&s;ted upon the removal of pain: but whether this po&s;itive plea&s;ure depended upon a particular center of percu&s;&s;ion hit
<PB N="37" REF="42">
upon by accident, or was the in&s;epa|rable effect of a kicking and &s;cratch|ing conferred by a royal foot and toe, I &s;hall not at pre&s;ent unfold: neither will I demon&s;trate the <HI>modus operandi</HI> on the nervous papillae of Fika-kaka's breech, whether by irritation, re|laxation, undulation, or vibration. Were the&s;e e&s;&s;ential di&s;coveries com|municated, human philo&s;ophy would become too arrogant. It was but the other day that Newton made &s;hift to dive into &s;ome &s;ubaltern laws of mat|ter; to explain the revolution of the planets, and analy&s;e the compo&s;ition of light; and ever &s;ince, that reptile man has believed it&s;elf a demi-god&mdash;I hope to &s;ee the day when the petu|lant philo&s;opher &s;hall be driven back to his Categories and the Organum Univer&s;ale of Ari&s;totle, his <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, his <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, and his <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>But waving the&s;e digre&s;&s;ions, the plea&s;ure which the Cuboy felt from the application of the Dairo's toe-nail
<PB N="38" REF="43">
was &s;ucceeded by a kind of ten&s;ion or &s;tiffne&s;s, which began to grow trouble&s;ome ju&s;t as he reached his own palace, where the Bonzas were a&s;&s;embled to offer up their diurnal incen&s;e. In&s;tinct, on this occa&s;ion, performed what could hardly have been expected from the mo&s;t extraor|dinary talents. At &s;ight of a griz|zled heard belonging to one of tho&s;e venerable doctors, he was &s;truck with the idea of a powerful a&s;&s;uager; and taking him into his cabinet, propo&s;ed that he &s;hould make oral application to the part affected. The propo&s;al was embraced without he&s;itation, and the effect even tran&s;cended the hope of the Cuboy. The o&s;culation it&s;elf was &s;oft, warm, emollient, and com|fortable; but when the nervous pa|pillae were gently &s;troaked, and as it were fondled by the long, ela&s;tic, peri&s;taltic, ab&s;ter&s;ive fibres that com|po&s;ed this reverend verriculum, &s;uch a delectable titillation en&s;ued, that Fika-ka was quite in raptures.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="44">
That which he intended at fir&s;t for a medicine he now converted into an article of luxury. All the Bon|zas who enrolled them&s;elves in the number of his dependants, whether old or young, black or fair, rough or &s;mooth, were enjoined every day to perform this additional and po&s;te|rior rite of wor&s;hip, &s;o productive of delight to the Cuboy, that he was every morning impatient to receive the Dairo's calcitration, or rather his pede&s;trian digitation; after which he flew with all the eagerne&s;s of de&s;ire to the &s;ub&s;equent part of his enter|tainment.</P>
<P>The tran&s;ports thus produced &s;eem|ed to di&s;arrange his whole nervous &s;y&s;tem, and produce an odd kind of revolution in his fancy; for tho' he was naturally grave, and indeed over|whelmed with con&s;titutional hebe|tude, he became, in con&s;equence of this periodical tickling, the mo&s;t giddy, pert buffoon in nature. All was grin|ning,
<PB N="40" REF="45">
giggling, laughing, and prat|ing, except when his fears intervened; then he &s;tarted and &s;tared, and cur&s;ed and prayed by turns. There was but one barber in the whole empire that would undertake to &s;have him, &s;o tickli&s;h and un&s;teady he was under the hands of the operator. He could not fit above one minute in the &s;ame attitude, or on the &s;ame &s;eat; but &s;hifted about from couch to chair, from chair to &s;tool, from &s;tool to clo&s;e-&s;tool, with ince&s;&s;ant rotation, and all the time gave audience to tho&s;e who &s;ollicited his favour and protection. To all and &s;everal he promi&s;ed his be&s;t offices, and con|firmed the&s;e promi&s;es with oaths and prote&s;tations. One he &s;hook by the hand; another he hugged; a third he ki&s;&s;ed on both &s;ides the face; with a fourth he whi&s;pered; a fifth he honoured with a familiar hor&s;e-laugh. He never had courage to refu&s;e even that which he could not po&s;&s;ibly
<PB N="41" REF="46">
grant; and at la&s;t his tongue actually forgot how to pronounce the negative particle: but as in the Engli&s;h lan|guage two nagatives amount to an af|firmative, five hundred affirmatives in the mouth of Fika-kaka did not altogether de&s;troy the efficacy of &s;im|ple negation. A promi&s;e five hun|dred times repeated, and at every repetition confirmed by oath, barely amounted to a computable chance of performance.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be allowed, however, he promoted a great number of Bonzas, and in this promotion he manife&s;ted an uncommon ta&s;te. They were pre|ferred according to the colour of their beards. He found, by experience, that beards of different colours yielded him different degrees of plea&s;ure in the friction we have de&s;cribed above; and the provi&s;ion he made for each was in proportion to the &s;atisfaction the candidate could afford. The &s;en|&s;ation en&s;uing from the contact of a
<PB N="42" REF="47">
grey beard was &s;oft and delicate, and agreeably demulcent, when the parts were unu&s;ually inflamed; a red, yel|low, or brindled beard, was in re|que&s;t when the bu&s;ine&s;s was to thrill or tingle: but a black beard was of all others the mo&s;t honoured by Fi|ka-kaka, not only on account of its fleecy feel, equally &s;pirited and bal|&s;amic, but al&s;o for another philo&s;o|phical rea&s;on, which I &s;hall now ex|plain. You know, Peacock, that black colour ab&s;orbs the rays of light, and detains them as it were in a re|po&s;itory. Thus a black beard, like the back of a black cat, becomes a pho&s;phorus in the dark, and emits &s;parkles upon friction. You mu&s;t know, that one of the grave&s;t doctors of the Bonzas, who had a private re|que&s;t to make, de&s;ired an audience of Fika-kaka in his clo&s;et at night, and the taper falling down by acci|dent, at that very in&s;tant when his beard was in contact with the Cuboy's
<PB N="43" REF="48">
&s;eat of honour, the electrical &s;nap was heard, and the part illuminated, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the &s;pectators, who looked upon it as a prelude to the apotheo&s;is of Fika-kaka. Being made acquainted with this phaeno|menon, the mini&s;ter was exceedingly elevated in his own mind. He re|joiced in it as a communication of &s;ome divine efficacy, and rai&s;ed the happy Bonza to the rank of Pontifex Maximus, or chief prie&s;t, in the tem|ple of Fakku-ba&s;i. In the cour&s;e of experiments, he found that all black beards were electrical in the &s;ame degree, and being ignorant of philo&s;ophy, a&s;cribed it to &s;ome &s;uper|natural virtue, in con&s;equence of which they were promoted as the holie&s;t of the Bonzas. But you and I know, that &s;uch a pho&s;phorus is obtained from the mo&s;t worthle&s;s and corrupted materials, &s;uch as rotten wood, putrefied veal, and &s;tink|ing whiting.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="49">
Fika-kaka, &s;uch as I de&s;cribed him, could not po&s;&s;ibly act in the character of Cuboy, without the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of coun&s;ellors and &s;ubalterns, who under&s;tood the detail of govern|ment and the forms of bu&s;ine&s;s. He was accordingly &s;urrounded by a number of &s;atellites, who reflected his lu&s;tre in their &s;everal &s;pheres of rotation; and though their immer|&s;ions and emer&s;ions were apparently abrubt and irregular, formed a kind of luminous belt as pale and comfort|le&s;s as the ring of Saturn, the mo&s;t di&s;tant, cold, and baleful of all the planets.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable of the&s;e &s;ub|ordinates, was Sti-phi-rum-poo, a man, who, from a low plebeian ori|gin, had rai&s;ed him&s;elf to one of the fir&s;t offices of the empire, to the dig|nity of <HI>Quo,</HI> or nobleman, and a con|&s;iderable &s;hare of the Dairo's per&s;onal regard. He owed his whole &s;ucce&s;s to his indu&s;try, a&s;&s;iduity, and circum|&s;pection.

During the former part of his life, he &s;tudied the laws of Japan with &s;uch &s;everity of application, that though una&s;&s;i&s;ted by the lea&s;t gleam of genius, and de&s;titute of the &s;mall|e&s;t preten&s;ion to talent, he made him|&s;elf ma&s;ter of all the written ordinan|ces, all the e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;toms, and forms of proceeding in the different tribunals of the empire. In the pro|gre&s;s of his vocation, he became an advocate of &s;ome eminence, and even acquired reputation for polemical elo|quence, though his manner was ever dry, laboured, and unplea&s;ant&mdash;Be|ing elevated to the &s;tation of a judge, he &s;o far ju&s;tified the intere&s;t by which he had been promoted, that his ho|ne&s;ty was never called in que&s;tion; and his &s;entences were generally al|lowed to be ju&s;t and upright. He heard cau&s;es with the mo&s;t painful at|tention, &s;eemed to be indefatigable in his re&s;earches after truth; and though he was forbidding in his a&s;pect, &s;low

in deliberation, tedious in di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and cold in his addre&s;s; yet I mu&s;t own, he was al&s;o unbia&s;&s;ed in his deci|&s;ions&mdash;I mean, unbia&s;&s;ed by any con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;ini&s;ter motive: for a man may be bia&s;&s;ed by the nature of his di&s;po&s;ition, as well as by prejudices acquired, and yet not guilty of inten|tional partiality. Sti-phi-rum-poo was &s;crupulou&s;ly ju&s;t, according to his own ideas of ju&s;tice, and con&s;equent|ly well qualified to decide in common controver&s;ies. But in delicate ca&s;es, which required an uncommon &s;hare of penetration; when the province of a &s;upreme judge is to mitigate the &s;eve|rity, and &s;ometimes even deviate from the dead letter of the common law, in favour of particular in&s;titutions, or of humanity in general; he had neither genius to enlighten his under&s;tanding, &s;entiment to elevate his mind, nor courage to &s;urmount the petty inclo|&s;ures of ordinary practice. He was ac|cu&s;ed of avarice and cruelty; but, in
<PB N="47" REF="52">
fact, the&s;e were not active pa&s;&s;ions in his heart. The conduct which &s;eem|ed to ju&s;tify the&s;e imputations, was wholly owing to a total want of ta&s;te and genero&s;ity. The nature of his po&s;t furni&s;hed him with opportunities to accumulate riches; and as the nar|rowne&s;s of his mind admitted no ideas of elegance or refined plea&s;ure, he knew not how to u&s;e his wealth &s;o as to avoid the charge of a &s;ordid di&s;|po&s;ition. His temper was not rapa|cious but retentive: he knew not the u&s;e of wealth, and therefore did not u&s;e it at all: but was in this particu|lar neither better nor wor&s;e than a &s;trong-box for the convenience and advantage of his heir. The appear|ance of cruelty remarkable in his coun&s;els, relating to &s;ome wretched in&s;urgents who had been taken in open rebellion, and the rancorous plea&s;ure he &s;eemed to feel in pro|nouncing &s;entence of death by &s;elf-<PB N="48" REF="53">

was in fact the grati|fication of a da&s;tardly heart, which had never acknowledged the lea&s;t impul&s;e of any liberal &s;entiment. This being the ca&s;e, mankind ought not to impute that to his guilt which was, in effect, the con&s;equence of his infirmity. A man might, with equal ju&s;tice, be puni&s;hed for being purblind. Sti-phi-rum-poo was much more culpable for &s;eeking to &s;hine in a &s;phere for which nature never intended him; I mean for com|mencing &s;tate&s;man, and intermed|dling in the machine of government: yet even into this character he was forced, as it were, by the opinion and injunctions of Fika-kaka, who em|ployed him at fir&s;t in making &s;peeches for the Dairo, which that prince u&s;ed to pronounce in public, at cer|tain
<PB N="49" REF="54">
&s;ea&s;ons of the year. The&s;e &s;peeches being tolerably well received by the populace, the Cuboy con|ceived an extraordinary opinion of his talents; and thought him ex|tremely well qualified to ea&s;e him of great part of the burthen of govern|ment. He found him very well di&s;|po&s;ed to engage heartily in his inte|re&s;ts. Then he was admitted to the o&s;culation <HI>a po&s;teriori;</HI> and though his beard was not black, but rather of a &s;ubfu&s;can hue, he managed it with &s;uch dexterity, that Fika-kaka declared the &s;alute gave him un&s;peak|able plea&s;ure: while the by&s;tanders prote&s;ted that the contact produced, not &s;imply electrical &s;parks or &s;cin|tillations, but even a perfect irradia|tion, which &s;eemed altogether &s;uper|natural. From this moment, Sti|phi-rum-poo was initiated in the my&s;teries of the cabinet, and even introduced to the per&s;on of the Dairo Got-hama-baba, who&s;e pede&s;trian fa|vours

he &s;hared with his new patron. It was ob&s;erved, however, that even after his promotion and nobilitation, he &s;till retained his original aukward|ne&s;s, and never could acquire that graceful ea&s;e of attitude with which the Cuboy pre&s;ented his parts aver&s;e to the contemplation of his &s;overeign. Indeed this mini&s;ter's body was &s;o well moulded for the celebration of the rite, that one would have ima|gined nature had formed him ex|pre&s;sly for that purpo&s;e, with his head and body projecting forwards, &s;o as to form an angle of forty-five with the horizon, while the glutaei mu&s;cles &s;welled backwards as if am|bitious to meet half-way the impe|rial encounter.</P>
<P>The third connexion that &s;treng|thened this political band was Nin-kom-poo-po, commander of the <HI>Fune,</HI> or navy of Japan, who, if ever man was, might &s;urely be termed the child of fortune. He was bred
<PB N="51" REF="56">
to the &s;ea from his infancy, and, in the cour&s;e of pacific &s;ervice, ro&s;e to the command of a jonkh, when he was &s;o lucky as to detect a crew of pyrates employed on a de&s;olate &s;hore in concealing a hoard of money which they had taken from the merchants of Corea. Nin-kom-poo-po, falling in with them at night, attacked them unawares, and having obtained an ea&s;y victory, carried off the trea&s;ure. I cannot help being amu&s;ed at the folly of you &s;illy mortals, when I re|collect the tran&s;ports of the people at the return of this fortunate officer, with a paultry ma&s;s of &s;ilver parading in covered waggons e&s;corted by his crew in arms. The whole city of Meaco re&s;ounded with acclamation; and Nin-kom-poo-po was extolled as the greate&s;t hero that ever the empire of Japan produced. The Cuboy ho|noured him with five ki&s;&s;es in public; accepted of the o&s;culation in private, recommended him in the &s;tronge&s;t
<PB N="52" REF="57">
terms to the Dairo, who promoted him to the rank of Sey-&s;eo-gun, or general at &s;ea. He profe&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf an adherent to the Cuboy, en|tered into a &s;trict alliance with Sti|phi-rum-poo, and the whole ma|nagement of the <HI>Fune</HI> was con&s;igned into his hands. With re&s;pect to his under&s;tanding, it was ju&s;t &s;ufficient to comprehend the duties of a com|mon mariner, and to follow the or|dinary route of the mo&s;t &s;ordid ava|rice. As to his heart, he might be &s;aid to be in a &s;tate of total apathy, without principle or pa&s;&s;ion; for I cannot afford the name of pa&s;&s;ion to &s;uch a vile appetite as an in&s;atiable thir&s;t of lucre. He was, indeed, &s;o cold and forbidding, that, in Japan, the people di&s;tingui&s;hed him by a nick-name equivalent to the Engli&s;h word Salamander; not that he was inclined to live in fire, but that the coldne&s;s of his heart would have ex|tingui&s;hed any fire it had approached.
<PB N="53" REF="58">
Some individuals imagined he had been begot upon a mermaid by a &s;ai|lor of Kam&s;chatka; but this was a mere fable.&mdash;I can a&s;&s;ure you, however, that when his lips were in contact with the Cuboy's po&s;teriors, Fika-kaka's teeth were &s;een to chat|ter. The pride of this animal was equal to his frigidity. He affected to e&s;tabli&s;h new regulations at the coun|cil where he pre&s;ided: he treated his equals with in&s;olence, and his &s;upe|riors with contempt. Other people generally rejoice in obliging their fel|low-creatures, when they can do it without prejudice to their own inte|re&s;t. Nin-kom-poo-po had a repul|&s;ive power in his di&s;po&s;ition; and &s;eemed to take plea&s;ure in denying a reque&s;t. When this vain creature, &s;elfi&s;h, inelegant, arrogant, and un|couth, appeared in all his trappings at the Dairo's court, upon a fe&s;tival, he might have been ju&s;tly compared to a Lapland idol of ice, adornedw th

a profu&s;ion of bra&s;s leaf and trinkets of pewter. In the direction of the Fune, he was provided with a certain number of a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, coun&s;ellors, or co-adjutors; but the&s;e he never con|&s;ulted, more than if they had been wooden images. He di&s;tributed his commands among his own depen|dants; and left all the forms of the office to the care of the &s;cribe, who thus became &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that his in|fluence &s;ometimes had well nigh in|terfered with that of the pre&s;ident: nay, they have been &s;een, like the electrical &s;pheres of two bodies, re|pelling each other. Hence it was ob&s;erved, that the office of the Sey|&s;eo-gun-&s;ialty re&s;embled the &s;erpent called Amphi&s;baena, which, contrary to the formation of other animals in head and tail, has a head where the tail &s;hould be. Well, indeed, might they compare them to a &s;erpent, in creeping, cunning, coldne&s;s, and ve|nom; but the compari&s;on would
<PB N="55" REF="60">
have held with more propriety, had Nature produced a &s;erpent without ever a head at all.</P>
<P>The fourth who contributed his credit and capacity to this coalition, was Fok&s;i-Roku, a man who greatly &s;urpa&s;&s;ed them all in the &s;cience of politicks, bold, &s;ubtle, intere&s;ted, in&s;inuating, ambitious, and indefa|tigable. An adventurer from his cra|dle, a latitudinarian in principle, a libertine in morals, without the ad|vantages of birth, fortune, charac|ter, or intere&s;t; by his own natural &s;agacity, a clo&s;e attention to the fol|lies and foibles of mankind, a pro|jecting &s;pirit, an invincible a&s;&s;urance, and an ob&s;tinacy of per&s;everance proof again&s;t all the &s;hocks of di&s;appoint|ment and repul&s;e; he forced him&s;elf as it were into the &s;cale of prefer|ment; and being found equally ca|pable and compliant, ro&s;e to high of|fices of tru&s;t and profit, dete&s;ted by the people, as one of the mo&s;t de&s;|perate

tools of a wicked admini&s;tra|tion; and odious to his colleagues in the m&mdash;y, for his &s;uperior talents, his re&s;tle&s;s ambition, and the uncer|tainty of his attachment.</P>
<P>As intere&s;t prompted him, he ho|vered between the triumvirate we have de&s;cribed, and another knot of competitors for the ad&mdash;n, headed by Quamba-cun-dono, a great Quo related to the Dairo, who had bore the &s;upreme command in the army, and was &s;tiled Fatzman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Kempfer. Amaenitat. Japan.</NOTE>, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, or, by way of eminence. This ac|compli&s;hed prince was not only the greate&s;t in his mind, but al&s;o the large&s;t in his per&s;on of all the &s;ub|jects of Japan; and whereas your Shake&s;peare makes Fal&s;taff urge it as a plea in his own favour, that as he had more fle&s;h, &s;o likewi&s;e he had more frailty than other men; I may ju&s;tly convert the propo&s;ition in favour of Quamba-cun-dono, and af|firm
<PB N="57" REF="62">
that as he had more fle&s;h, &s;o he had more virtue than any other Japone&s;e; more bowels, more hu|manity, more beneficence, more affability. He was undoubtedly, for a Fatzman, the mo&s;t courteous, the mo&s;t gallant, the mo&s;t elegant, ge|nerous, and munificent Quo that ever adorned the court of Japan. So con|&s;ummate in the art of war, that the whole world could not produce a general to match him in fore&s;ight, vigilance, conduct, and ability. In|deed his intellects were &s;o extraor|dinary and exten&s;ive, that he &s;eemed of &s;entimentize at every pore, and to have the faculty of thinking di&s;|fu&s;ed all over his frame, even to his fingers ends; or, as the Latins call it <HI>ad unguem:</HI> nay, &s;o wonderful was his organical conformation, that, in the opinion of many Japone&s;e philo|&s;ophers, his whole body was enve|loped in a kind of poultice of brain, and that if he had lo&s;t his head in bat|tle,
<PB N="58" REF="63">
the damage with regard to his power of reflection would have been &s;carce perceptible. After he had atchieved many glorious exploits, in a war again&s;t the Chine&s;e on the con|tinent, he was &s;ent with a &s;trong ar|my to quell a dangerous in&s;urrection in the northern parts of Ximo, which is one of the Japone&s;e i&s;lands. He accordingly by his valour cru&s;hed the rebellion; and afterwards, by dint of clemency and di&s;cretion, extingui&s;hed the la&s;t embers of di&s;affection. When the in&s;urgents were defeated, di&s;per&s;ed, and di&s;armed, and a &s;uf|ficient number &s;elected for example, his humanity emerged, and took full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his brea&s;t. He con&s;i|dered them as wretched men mi&s;led by fal&s;e principles of honour, and &s;ympathized with their di&s;tre&s;s: he pitied them as men and fellow-citi|zens: he regarded them as u&s;eful fellow-&s;ubjects, who might be re|claimed and reunited to the commu|nity.
<PB N="59" REF="64">
In&s;tead of &s;ending out the mi|ni&s;ters of blood, rapine, and revenge, to ravage, burn, and de&s;troy, with|out di&s;tinction of age, &s;ex, or prin|ciple; he extended the arms of mer|cy to all who would embrace that indulgence: he protected the lives and habitations of the helple&s;s, and dimini&s;hed the number of the mal|contents much more effectually by his benevolence than by his &s;word.</P>
<P>The &s;outhern Japone&s;e had been terribly alarmed at this in&s;urrection, and in the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of their de|liverance, voluntarily taxed them|&s;elves with a con&s;iderable yearly tri|bute to the hero Quamba-cun-dono. In all probability, they would not have appeared &s;o grateful, had they &s;tayed to &s;ee the effects of his mer|ciful di&s;po&s;ition towards the van|qui&s;hed rebels: for mercy is &s;urely no attribute of the Japone&s;e, con&s;i|dered as a people. Indeed, nothing could form a more &s;triking contra&s;t,
<PB N="60" REF="65">
than appeared in the tran&s;actions in the northern and &s;outhern parts of the empire at this juncture. While the amiable Quamba-cun-dono was em|ployed in the godlike office of ga|thering together, and cheri&s;hing un|der his wings the poor, di&s;per&s;ed, forlorn, widows and orphans, whom the &s;avage hand of war had deprived of parent, hu&s;band, home, and &s;u&s;|tenance; while he, in the North, ga|thered the&s;e mi&s;erable creatures, even as a hen gathereth her chickens; Sti-phi-rum-poo, and other judges in the South, were condemning &s;uch of their parents and hu&s;bands as &s;ur|vived the &s;word, to crucifixion, caul|drons of boiling oil, or exenteration; and the people were indulging their appetites by fea&s;ting upon the vi&s;cera thus extracted. The liver of a Xi|mian was in &s;uch reque&s;t at this pe|riod, that if the market had been properly managed and &s;upplied, this delicacy would have &s;old for two
<PB N="61" REF="66">
Obans a pound, or about four pounds &s;terling. The troops in the North might have provided at the rate of a thou&s;and head per month for the de|mand of Meaco; and tho' the other parts of the carca&s;e would not have &s;old at &s;o high a price as the liver, heart, harrigals, &s;weet-bread, and pope's eye; yet the whole, upon an average, would have fetched at the rate of three hundred pounds a head; e&s;pecially if tho&s;e animals, which are but poorly fed in their own country, had been fattened up and kept upon hard meat for the &s;laughter. This new branch of traffick would have produced about three hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds annually: for the rebellion might ea&s;ily have been fomented from year to year; and con|&s;equently it would have yielded a con&s;iderable addition to the empe|ror's revenue, by a proper taxation.</P>
<P>The philo&s;ophers of Japan were divided in their opinions concerning
<PB N="62" REF="67">
this new ta&s;te for Ximian fle&s;h, which &s;uddenly &s;prung up among the Japone&s;e. Some a&s;cribed it to a principle of hatred and revenge, agreeable to the common expre&s;&s;ion of animo&s;ity among the multitude, <Q REND="inline">"You dog, I'll have your liver."</Q> Others imputed it to a notion ana|lagous to the vulgar conceit, that the liver of a mad dog being eaten is a preventive again&s;t madne&s;s; er|go, the liver of a traitor is an anti|dote again&s;t trea&s;on. A third &s;ort derived this &s;trange appetite from the belief of the Americans, who imagine they &s;hall inherit all the vir|tues of the enemies they devour; and a fourth affirmed that the de|mand for this dainty aro&s;e from a very high and peculiar flavour in Ximian fle&s;h, which flavour was di&s;covered by accident: moreover, there were not wanting &s;ome who &s;uppo&s;ed this banquet was a kind of &s;acrifice to the powers of &s;orcery;
<PB N="63" REF="68">
as we find that one of the ingredients of the charm prepared in Shake&s;pear's cauldron was <Q REND="inline">"the liver of bla&s;|pheming Jew:"</Q> and indeed it is not at all improbable that the liver of a rebellious Ximian might be altoge|ther as effectual. I know that Fi|ka-kaka was &s;timulated by curio&s;ity to try the experiment, and held di|vers con&s;ultations with his cooks on this &s;ubject. They all declared in favour of the trial; and it was ac|cordingly pre&s;ented at the table, where the Cuboy eat of it to &s;uch exce&s;s as to produce a &s;urfeit. He underwent a &s;evere evacuation both ways, attended with cold &s;weats and &s;woonings. In a word, his agony was &s;o violent, that he ever after loathed the &s;ight of Ximian fle&s;h, whether dead or alive.</P>
<P>With the Fatzman Quamba-cun-dono was connected another Quo called Gotto-mio, viceroy of Xico|co, one of the i&s;lands of Japan. If
<PB N="64" REF="69">
his under&s;tanding had been as large as his fortune, and his temper a little more tractable, he would have been a dangerous rival to the Cuboy. But if their brains had been weighed again&s;t each other, the nineteenth part of a grain would have turned either &s;cale; and as Fika-kaka had negative qualities, which &s;upported and extended his per&s;onal influence, &s;o Gotto-mio had po&s;itive powers, that defended him from all ap|proaches of popularity. His pride was of the in&s;olent order; his tem|per extremely ira&s;cible; and his ava|rice quite rapacious: nay, he is &s;aid to have once declined the honour of a kicking from the Dairo. Conceited of his own talents, he affected to ha|rangue in the council of Twenty Eight; but his ideas were embar|ra&s;&s;ed; his language was mean; and his elocution more di&s;cordant than the braying of fifty a&s;&s;es. When Fika-kaka addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to &s;peech, an
<PB N="65" REF="70">
agreeable &s;imper played upon the countenances of all the audience: but &s;oon as Gotto-mio &s;tood up, every &s;pectator rai&s;ed his thumbs to his ears, as it were in&s;tinctively. The Dairo Got-hama-baba, by the advice of the Cuboy, &s;ent him over to govern the people of Xicoco, and a more effec|tual method could not have been taken to mortify his arrogance. His de|portment was &s;o in&s;olent, his oecono|my &s;o &s;ordid, and his government &s;o arbitrary, that tho&s;e i&s;landers, who are remarkably ferocious and impa|tient, expre&s;&s;ed their hatred and con|tempt of him on every occa&s;ion. His Quanbuku&s;hip was hardly &s;afe from outrage in the mid&s;t of his guards; and a cro&s;s was actully erec|ted for the execution of his favou|rite Kow-kin, who e&s;caped with &s;ome difficulty to the i&s;land of Ni|phon, whither al&s;o his patron &s;oon followed him, attended by the cur&s;es of the people whom he had been &s;ent to rule.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="71">
He who pre&s;ided at the council of Twenty Eight was called Soo-&s;an-&s;in-o, an old experienced &s;hrewd po|litician, who conveyed more &s;en&s;e in one &s;ingle &s;entence, than could have been di&s;tilled from all the other brains in council, had they been macerated in one alembic. He was a man of exten&s;ive learning and elegant ta&s;te. He &s;aw through the characters of his fellow-labourers in the ad&mdash;n. He laughed at the folly of one fac|tion, and dete&s;ted the arrogance and pre&s;umption of the other. In an a&s;|&s;embly of &s;en&s;ible men, his talents would have &s;hone with &s;uperior lu&s;|tre: but at the council of Twenty Eight, they were ob&s;cured by the thick clouds of ignorance that enve|loped his brethren. The Dairo had a per&s;onal re&s;pect for him, and is &s;aid to have conferred frequent fa|vours on his po&s;teriors in private. He kicked the Cuboy often <HI>ex officio,</HI> as a husband thinks it incumbent up|on

He laughed and quaffed with his &s;elect companions in private; received his appointments thankfully; and &s;wam with the tide of politicks as it hap|pened to flow.&mdash;It was pretty ex|traordinary that the wi&s;e&s;t man &s;hould be the greate&s;t cypher: but &s;uch was the will of the gods.</P>

might have been more ju&s;tly &s;aid of the Japone&s;e councils. There was neither invention, unity, nor de&s;ign among them. They con&s;i&s;ted of mobs of &s;auntering, &s;trolling, vagrant, and ridiculous politicians. Their &s;chemes were ab&s;urd, and their deliberations like the &s;ketches of anarchy.

<P>The two factions that divided the council of Japan, tho' inveterate ene|mies to each other, heartily and cor|dially concurred in one particular, which was the wor&s;hip e&s;tabli&s;hed in the temple of Fakkuba&s;i, or the White Hor&s;e. This was the orthodox faith in Japan, and was certainly founded, as St. Paul &s;aith of the Chri&s;tian religion, upon the evidence of things not &s;een. All the votaries of this &s;uper&s;tition of Fakkuba&s;i &s;ub|&s;cribed and &s;wore to the following creed, implicitly, without he&s;itation, or mental re&s;ervation. <Q REND="inline">"I believe in the White Hor&s;e, that he de&s;cended

<P>Having thus characteri&s;ed the chiefs that di&s;puted the admini&s;tra|tion, or, in other words, the empire of Japan, I &s;hall now proceed to a plain narration of hi&s;torical incidents, without pretending to philo&s;ophize like H&mdash;e, or dogmatize like S&mdash;tt. I &s;hall only tell thee, Nathaniel, that Britain never gave birth but to two hi&s;torians worthy of credit, and they were Talie&s;&s;in and Geoffrey of Monmouth. I'll
<PB N="72" REF="77">
tell you another &s;ecret. The whole world has never been able to produce &s;ix good hi&s;torians. Herodotus is fabulous even to a proverb; Thucy|dides is perplexed, ob&s;cure, and un|important; Polybius is dry and in|elegant; Livy &s;uperficial; and Ta|citus a coxcomb. Guicciardini wants intere&s;t; Davila, dige&s;tion; and Sarpi, truth. In the whole cata|logue of French hi&s;torians, there is not one of tolerable authenticity</P>
<P>In the year of the period Foggien one hundred and fifty four, the tran|quility of Japan was interrupted by the incroachments of the Chine&s;e ad|venturers, who made de&s;cents upon certain i&s;lands belonging to the Ja|pone&s;e a great way to the &s;outhward of Xicoco. They even &s;ettled colo|nies, and built forts on &s;ome of them, while the two empires were at peace with each other. When the Japo|ne&s;e governors expo&s;tulated with the Chine&s;e officers on this intru&s;ion,
<PB N="73" REF="78">
they were treated with ridicule and contempt: then they had recour&s;e to force of arms, and &s;ome &s;kir|mi&s;hes were fought with various &s;ucce&s;s. When the tidings of the&s;e ho&s;tilities arrived at Meaco, the whole council of Twenty-Eight was overwhelmed with fear and confu|&s;ion. The Dairo kicked them all round, not from pa&s;&s;ion, but by way of giving an animating fillip to their deliberative faculties. The di&s;putes had happened in the i&s;land of Fat|&s;i&s;&s;io: but there were only three members of the council who knew that Fat&s;i&s;&s;io was an i&s;land, although the commerce there carried on was of the utmo&s;t importance to the em|pire of Japan. They were as much in the dark with re&s;pect to its &s;itua|tion. Fika-kaka, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that it adjoined to the coa&s;t of Co|rea, expre&s;&s;ed his apprehen&s;ion that the Chine&s;e would invade it with a numerous army; and was &s;o tran&s;|ported
<PB N="74" REF="79">
when Fok&s;i-roku a&s;&s;ured him it was an i&s;land at a va&s;t di&s;tance from any continent, that he ki&s;&s;ed him five times in the face of the whole council; and his royal ma&s;|ter, Got-hama-baba, &s;wore he &s;hould be indulged with a double portion of kicking at his next private audience. The &s;ame coun&s;ellor propo&s;ed, that as the Fune or navy of Japan was much more numerous than the fleet of China, they &s;hould immediately avail them&s;elves of this advantage. Quamba-cun-dono the Fatzman was of opinion that war &s;hould be im|mediately declared, and an army tran&s;ported to the continent. Sti|phi-rum-poo thought it would be more expedient to &s;weep the &s;eas of the Chine&s;e trading ve&s;&s;els, without giving them any previous intimation; and to this opinion admiral Nin-kom-poo-po &s;ub&s;cribed, not only out of deference to the &s;uperior under|&s;tanding of his &s;age ally, who un|dertook
<PB N="75" REF="80">
to prove it was not contrary to the law of nature and nations, to plunder the &s;ubjects of foreign pow|ers, who trade on the faith of trea|ties; but al&s;o from his own inclina|tion, which was much addicted to pillage without blood&s;hed. To him, therefore, the ta&s;k was left of &s;cour|ing the &s;eas, and intercepting the &s;uc|cours which (they had received in|telligence) were ready to &s;ail from one of the ports of China to the i&s;land of Fat&s;i&s;&s;io. In the mean time, junks were provided for tran&s;|porting thither a body of Japone&s;e troops, under the command of one Koan, an ob&s;cure officer without conduct or experience, whom the Fatzman &s;elected for this &s;ervice: not that he &s;uppo&s;ed him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uperior merit, but becau&s;e no leader of di&s;tinction cared to engage in &s;uch a di&s;agreeable expedition.</P>
<P>Nin-kom-poo-po acted according to the ju&s;te&s;t ideas which had been
<PB N="76" REF="81">
formed of his under&s;tanding. He let loo&s;e his crui&s;ers among the mer|chant &s;hips of China, and the har|bours of Japan were quickly filled with prizes and pri&s;oners. The Chine&s;e exclaimed again&s;t the&s;e pro|ceedings as the mo&s;t perfidious acts of piracy; and all the other powers of A&s;ia beheld them with a&s;toni&s;h|ment. But the con&s;ummate wi&s;dom of the &s;ea Sey-&s;eo-gun appeared mo&s;t con&s;picuous in another &s;troke of ge|neral&s;hip, which he now &s;truck. In&s;tead of blocking up in the Chi|ne&s;e harbour the &s;uccours de&s;tined to reinforce the enemy in Fat&s;i&s;&s;io, until they &s;hould be driven from their incroachments on that i&s;land, he very wi&s;ely &s;ent a &s;trong &s;quadron of Fune to crui&s;e in the open &s;ea, midway between China and Fat&s;i&s;&s;io, in the mo&s;t tempe&s;tuous &s;ea&s;on of the year, when the fogs are &s;o thick and &s;o con&s;tant in that latitude, as to rival the darkne&s;s of a winter

night; and &s;upported the fea&s;ibility of this &s;cheme in council, by ob&s;erv|ing, that the enemy would be thus decoyed from their harbour, and un|doubtedly intercepted in their pa&s;|&s;age by the Japone&s;e &s;quadron. This plan was applauded as one of the mo&s;t ingenious &s;tratagems that ever was devi&s;ed; and Fika-kaka in&s;i&s;ted upon ki&s;&s;ing his po&s;teriors, as the mo&s;t honourable mark of his ap|probation.</P>
<P>Philo&s;ophers have ob&s;erved, that the motives of actions are not to be e&s;timated by events. Fortune did not altogether fulfil the expectations of the council. General Koan &s;uf|fered him&s;elf and his army to be de|coyed into the middle of a wood, where they &s;tood like &s;heep in the &s;hambles, to be &s;laughtered by an un&s;een enemy. The Chine&s;e &s;uc|cours perceiving their harbour open, &s;et &s;ail for Fat&s;i&s;&s;io, which they reached in &s;afety, by changing their
<PB N="78" REF="83">
cour&s;e about one degree from the common route; while the Japone&s;e Fune continued crui&s;ing among the fogs, until the &s;hips were &s;hattered by &s;torms, and the crews more than half de&s;troyed by cold and di&s;|temper.</P>
<P>When the news of the&s;e di&s;a&s;ters arrived, great commotion aro&s;e in the council. The Dairo Got-hama-baba fluttered, and clucked and cackled and hi&s;&s;ed like a goo&s;e di&s;|turbed in the act of incubation. Quamba-cun-dono &s;hed bitter tears: the Cuboy &s;nivelled and &s;obbed: Sti-phi-rum-poo groaned: Gotto|mio &s;wore: but the &s;ea Sey-&s;eo-gun Nin-kom-poo-po underwent no al|teration. He &s;at as the emblem of in&s;en&s;ibility, fixed as the north &s;tar, and as cold as that luminary, &s;ending forth emanations of frigidity. Fi|ka-ka, mi&s;taking this congelation for fortitude, went round and embraced him where he &s;at, exclaiming, <Q REND="inline">"My
<PB N="79" REF="84">
dear Day, Sey-&s;eo-gun, what would you advi&s;e in this dilemma?"</Q> But the contact had almo&s;t co&s;t him his life; for the touch of Nin-kom-poo-po, thus congealed, had the &s;ame effect as that of the fi&s;h called Torpor. The Cuboy's whole body was in|&s;tantly benumbed; and if his friends had not in&s;tantly poured down his throat a con&s;iderable quantity of &s;trong &s;pirit, the circulation would have cea&s;ed. This is what philo&s;o|phers call a generation of cold, which became &s;o inten&s;e, that the mercury in a Japone&s;e thermometer con&s;truc|ted on the &s;ame principles which were afterwards adopted by Fahrn|heit, and fixed in the apartment, immediately &s;unk thirty degrees be|low the freezing point.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment of the council was &s;ucceeded by critical re|marks and argumentation. The Dairo con&s;oled him&s;elf by ob&s;erving, that his troops made a very &s;oldierly
<PB N="80" REF="85">
appearance as they lay on the field in their new cloathing, &s;mart caps, and clean bu&s;kins; and that the ene|my allowed they had never &s;een beards and whiskers in better order. He then declared, that &s;hould a war en&s;ue with China, he would go abroad and expo&s;e him&s;elf for the glory of Japan. Fok&s;i-roku expre&s;|&s;ed his &s;urprize, that a general &s;hould march his army through a wood in an unknown country, without hav|ing it fir&s;t reconnoitred: but the Fatzman a&s;&s;ured him, that was a practice never admitted into the di&s;|cipline of Japan. Gotto-mio &s;wore the man was mad to &s;tand with his men, like oxen in a &s;tall, to be knocked on the head without u&s;ing any means of defence. <Q REND="inline">"Why the devil (&s;aid he) did not he either re|treat, or advance to clo&s;e engagement with the handful of Chine&s;e who formed the ambu&s;cade?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"I hope, my dear Quanbuku, (replied the
<PB N="81" REF="86">
Fatzman) that the troops of Japan will always &s;tand without flinching. I &s;hould have been mortified beyond mea&s;ure, had they retreated without &s;eeing the face of the enemy:&mdash;that would have been a di&s;grace which never befel any troops formed under my direction; and as for ad|vancing, the ground would not per|mit any manoeuvre of that nature. They were engaged in a <HI>cul de &s;ac,</HI> where they could not form either in hollow &s;quare, front line, potence, column or platoon.&mdash;It was the for|tune of war, and they bore it like men:&mdash;we &s;hall be more fortunate on another occa&s;ion."</Q> The pre&s;ident Soo-&s;an-&s;in-o, took notice, that if there had been one &s;paniel in the whole Japone&s;e army, this di&s;a&s;ter could not have happened; as the animal would have beat the bu&s;hes and di&s;covered the ambu&s;cade. He therefore propo&s;ed, that if the war was to be pro&s;ecuted in Fat&s;i&s;&s;io,
<PB N="82" REF="87">
which is a country overgrown with wood, a number of blood-hounds might be provided and &s;ent over, to run upon the foot in the front and on the flanks of the army, when it &s;hould be on its march through &s;uch impediments. Quamba-cun-dono declared, that &s;oldiers had much better die in the bed of honour, than be &s;aved and victorious, by &s;uch an unmilitary expedient; that &s;uch a propo&s;al was &s;o contrary to the rules of war and the &s;cheme of enli&s;ting dogs &s;o derogatory from the dignity of the &s;ervice, that if ever it &s;hould be embraced, he would re&s;ign his command, and &s;pend the remainder of his life in retirement. This ca|nine project was equally di&s;liked by the Dairo, who approved of the Fatzman's objection, and &s;ealed his approbation with a pede&s;trian &s;alute of &s;uch momentum, that the Fatz|man could hardly &s;tand under the weight of the compliment. It was
<PB N="83" REF="88">
agreed that new levies &s;hould be made, and a new &s;quadron of Fune equipped with all expedition; and thus the a&s;&s;embly broke up.</P>
<P>Fortune had not yet &s;ufficiently humbled the pride of Japan. That body of Chine&s;e which defeated Koan, made &s;everal conque&s;ts in Fa&s;t|&s;i&s;&s;io, and &s;eemed to be in a fair way of reducing the whole i&s;land. Yet, the court of China, not &s;atisfied with this &s;ucce&s;s, re&s;olved to &s;trike a blow, that &s;hould be equally humiliating to the Japone&s;e, in another part of the world. Having by &s;pecious re|mon&s;trances already prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the neighbouring nations again&s;t the government of Japan, as the patrons of perfidy and piracy; they fitted out an armament, which was in|tended to &s;ubdue the i&s;land of Mo|tao on the coa&s;t of Corea, which the Japone&s;e had taken in a former war, and now occupied at a very great ex|pence, as a place of the utmo&s;t im|portance
<PB N="84" REF="89">
to the commerce of the empire. Repeated advices of the ene|my's de&s;ign were &s;ent from different parts, to the m&mdash;y of Japan: but they &s;eemed all overwhelmed by &s;uch a lethargy of infatuation, that no mea&s;ures of prevention were con|certed.</P>
<P>Such was the opinion of the peo|ple; but the truth is, they were fa&s;t a&s;leep. The Japone&s;e hold with the antient Greeks and modern Americans, that dreams are from heaven; and in any perplexing emer|gency, they, like the Indians, Jews, and natives of Madaga&s;car, have re|cour&s;e to dreaming as to an oracle. The&s;e dreams or divinations are pre|ceded by certain religious rites ana|lagous to the ceremony of the ephod, the urim and the thummim. The rites were religiou&s;ly performed in the council of Twenty-Eight; and a deep &s;leep overpowered the Dairo and all his coun&s;ellors.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="90">
Got-hama-baba the emperor, who repo&s;ed his head upon the pillowy &s;ides of Quamba-cun-dono, dreamed that he was &s;acrificing in the temple of Fakkuba&s;i, and &s;aw the deity of the White Hor&s;e devouring pearls by the bu&s;hel at one end, and void|ing corruption by the ton at the other. The Fatzman dreamed that a great number of Chine&s;e cooks were bu&s;y buttering his brains. Got|to-mio dreamed of lending money and borrowing &s;en&s;e. Sti-phi-rum-poo thought he had procured a new law for clapping padlocks upon the cha&s;tity of all the females in Japan under twenty, of which padlocks he him&s;elf kept the keys. Nin-kom-poo-po dreamed he was metamor|pho&s;ed into a &s;ea-lion, in pur&s;uit of a &s;hoal of golden gudgeons. <HI>One did laugh in's &s;leep, and one cried murder.</HI> The fir&s;t was Soo-&s;an-&s;in-o, who had preci&s;ely the &s;ame vi&s;ion that di&s;turbed the imagination of the Cu|boy.
<PB N="86" REF="91">
He thought he &s;aw the face of a right reverend prelate of the Bon|zas, united with and growing to the po&s;teriors of the mini&s;ter. Fika-kaka underwent the &s;ame di&s;agree|able illu&s;ion, with this aggravating circum&s;tance, that he already felt the teeth of the &s;aid Bonza. The pre&s;ident laughed aloud at the ridi|culous phaenomenon: the Cuboy ex|claimed in the terror of being en|cumbered with &s;uch a mon&s;trous appendage. It was not without &s;ome rea&s;on he cried, <Q REND="inline">"Murder!"</Q> Fok|&s;i-roku, who happened to &s;leep on the next chair, dreamed of mo|ney-bags, places, and rever&s;ions; and in the tran&s;port of his eagerne&s;s, laid fa&s;t hold on the trunk-breeches of the Cuboy, including certain fun|damentals, which he gra&s;ped &s;o vio|lently as to excite pain, and extort the exclamation from Fika-kaka, even in his &s;leep.</P>
<P>The council being at la&s;t waked
<PB N="78" REF="92">
by the clamours of the people, who &s;urrounded the palace, and proclaimed that Motao was in danger of an inva|&s;ion; the &s;ea Sey-&s;eo-gun Nin-kom-poo-po, was ordered to fit out a fleet of Fune for the relief of that i&s;land; and directions were given that the commander of the&s;e Fune &s;hould, in his voyage, touch at the garri&s;on of Foutao, and take on board from thence a certain number of troops, to reinforce the Japone&s;e governor of the place that was in danger. Nin-kom-poo-po for this &s;ervice cho&s;e the commander Bihn-goh, a man who had never &s;ignalized him&s;elf by any act of valour. He &s;ent him out with a &s;quadron of Fune ill manned, wretchedly provided, and inferior in number to the fleet of China, which was by this time known to be a&s;&s;em|bled in order to &s;upport the inva&s;ion of the i&s;land of Motao. He &s;ailed, neverthele&s;s, on this expedition, and touched at the garri&s;on of Foutao to
<PB N="88" REF="93">
take in the reinforcement: but the orders &s;ent for this purpo&s;e from Nob-o-di, mini&s;ter for the depart|ment of war, appeared &s;o contradic|tory and ab&s;urd, that they could not po&s;&s;ibly be obeyed; &s;o that Bihn|goh proceeded without the reinforce|ment towards Motao, the principal fortre&s;s of which was by this time inve&s;ted. He had been accidentally joined by a few crui&s;ers, which ren|dered him equal in &s;trength to the Chine&s;e &s;quadron which he now de|&s;cried. Both commanders &s;eemed afraid of each other. The fleets, however, engaged; but little da|mage was done to either. They parted as if by con&s;ent. Bihn-goh made the be&s;t of his way back to Foutao, without making the lea&s;t attempt to &s;uccour, or open a com|munication with Fi-de-ta-da, the governor of Motao, who, looking upon him&s;elf as abandoned by his country, &s;urrendered his fortre&s;s,

with the whole i&s;land, to the Chi|ne&s;e general. The&s;e di&s;graces hap|pening on the back of the Fat&s;i&s;&s;ian di&s;a&s;ters, rai&s;ed a prodigious ferment in Japan, and the mini&s;try had al|mo&s;t &s;unk under the fir&s;t fury of the people's re&s;entment. They not only exclaimed again&s;t the folly of the ad|mini&s;tration, but they al&s;o accu&s;ed them of treachery; and &s;eemed to think that the glory and advantage of the empire had been betrayed. What increa&s;ed the commotion was the terror of an inva&s;ion, with which the Chine&s;e threatened the i&s;lands of Japan. The terrors of Fika-ka had already co&s;t him two pair of trunk ho&s;e, which were defiled by &s;udden &s;allies or irruptions from the po&s;tern of his microco&s;m; and the&s;e were attended with &s;uch noi&s;ome effluvia, that the Bonzas could not perform the barbal ab&s;ter&s;ion without marks of abhorrence.

<P>Here I intended to in&s;ert a di&s;&s;er|tation on trou&s;ers or trunk breeches, called by the Greeks <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, &amp; <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, by the Latins <HI>braccae laxae,</HI> by the Spaniards <HI>bragas anchas,</HI> by the Ita|lians <HI>calzone largo,</HI> by the French <HI>baut de chau&s;&s;es,</HI> by the Saxons <HI>braecce,</HI> by the Swedes <HI>brackor,</HI> by the Iri&s;h <HI>briechan,</HI> by the Celtae <HI>brag,</HI> and by the Japone&s;e <HI>bra-ak.</HI> I could make &s;ome curious di&s;cove|ries touching the analogy between the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> and <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, and point out the preci&s;e time at which the Grecian women began to wear the breeches.

parallel between the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> of the Greek, and the <HI>&s;him</HI> or middle cloth worn by the black ladies in Guinea. I would have proved that breeches were not fir&s;t u&s;ed to defend the central parts from the injuries of the weather, ina&s;much as they were fir&s;t worn by the Orientals in a warm climate; as you may &s;ee in Per&s;ius, <HI>Braccatis illita medis&mdash;porticus.</HI> I would have &s;hewn that breeches were fir&s;t brought from A&s;ia to the nor|thern parts of Europe, by the Celtae &s;prung from the antient Gomanaus: that trou&s;ers were wore in Scotland long before the time of Pythagoras; and indeed we are told by Jambly|chus, that Abaris, the famous High|land philo&s;opher, cotemporary, and per&s;onally acquainted with the &s;age of Crotona, wore long trou&s;ers. I my&s;elf can atte&s;t the truth of that de&s;cription, as I well remember the per&s;on and habit of that learned mountaineer. I would have explained
<PB N="92" REF="97">
the rea&s;ons that compelled the po&s;te|rity of tho&s;e mountaineers to aban|don the breeches of their forefathers, and expo&s;e their po&s;teriors to the wind. I would have convinced the Engli&s;h antiquaries that the inhabi|tants of York&s;hire came originally from the Highlands of Scotland, be|fore the Scots had laid a&s;ide their breeches, and wore this part of dre&s;s, long after their ance&s;tors, as well as the &s;outhern Britons were un|breeched by the Romans. From this di&s;tinction they acquired the name of <HI>Brigantes, qua&s;i Bragantes;</HI> and hence came the verb to <HI>brag</HI> or boa&s;t contemptuou&s;ly: for the neigh|bours of the Brigantes being at vari|ance with that people, u&s;ed, by way of contumelious defiance, when they &s;aw any of them pa&s;&s;ing or repa&s;&s;ing, to clap their hands on their po&s;teriors, and cry <HI>Brag-Brag.</HI>&mdash;I would have drawn a learned compari&s;on between the &s;hield of Ajax and the &s;even-fold

Fi|nally, I would have promulgated the original u&s;e of trunk breeches, which would have led me into a di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion of the rites of Cloacina, &s;o differently wor&s;hipped by the &s;ou|thern and northern inhabitants of this kingdom. The&s;e di&s;qui&s;itions would have unveiled the my&s;teries that now conceal the orgin, migra|tion, &s;uper&s;tition, language, laws, and connexions of different nations&mdash;<HI>&s;ed nunc non erit his locus.</HI> I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that Lin&s;chot and others are mi&s;taken in deriving the Japone&s;e from their neighbours the Chine&s;e; and that Dr. Kempfer is right in his conjecture, &s;uppo&s;ing them to have come from Media im|mediately after the confu&s;ion of Ba|bel. It is no wonder, therefore, that being <HI>Braccatorum filii,</HI> they &s;hould retain the wide breeches of their progenitors.</P>

<PB N="97" REF="102">
was, by this time, increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, that the Cuboy could utter nothing more <HI>ab anteriori;</HI> and the majority of the members &s;at agha&s;t in &s;ilence. The Dairo declared he would throw his cap out of the win|dow into the mid&s;t of the populace, and challenge any &s;ingle man of them to bring it up: but he was di&s;&s;uaded from hazarding his &s;acred per&s;on in &s;uch a manner. Quamba-cun-dono propo&s;ed to let loo&s;e the guards among the multitude: but Fika-kaka pro|te&s;ted he could never agree to an ex|pedient &s;o big with danger to the per&s;ons of all pre&s;ent. Sti-phi-rum-poo was of opinion, that they &s;hould proceed according to law, and indict the leaders of the mob for a riot. Nin-kom-poo-po exhorted the Dairo and the whole council to take refuge on board the fleet. Gotto-mio &s;weated in &s;ilence: he trembled for his money-bags, and dreaded another encounter with the mob, by whom
<PB N="98" REF="103">
he had &s;uffered &s;everely in the fle&s;h, upon a former occa&s;ion. The pre&s;i|dent &s;hrugged up his &s;houlders, and kept his eye fixed upon a po&s;tern or back-door. In this general con&s;ter|nation, Fok&s;i-roku &s;tood up and of|fered a &s;cheme, which was imme|diately put in execution. <Q REND="inline">"The multitude, my Lords, (&s;aid he) is a many headed mon&s;ter&mdash;it is a Cerbe|rus that mu&s;t have a &s;op:&mdash;it is a wild bea&s;t, &s;o ravenous that nothing but blood will appea&s;e its appetite:&mdash;it is a whale, that mu&s;t have a barrel for its amu&s;ement:&mdash;it is a daemon to which we mu&s;t offer up human &s;acrifice.

<P>The &s;peech was heard with univer|&s;al applau&s;e: Fok&s;i-roku was kicked by the Dairo and ki&s;&s;ed by the Cu|boy, in token of approbation. The populace were di&s;per&s;ed by means of fair promi&s;es. Bihn-goh was put under arre&s;t, and kept as a malefac|tor in clo&s;e pri&s;on. Agents were
<PB N="100" REF="105">
employed through the whole metro|polis to vilify his character, and ac|cu&s;e him of cowardice and treachery. Authors were enli&s;ted to defame him in public writings; and mobs hired to hang and burn him in effigie. By the&s;e means the revenge of the people was artfully transferred, and their attention effectually diverted from the mini&s;try, which was the fir&s;t object of their indignation. At length, matters being duly prepared for the exhibition of &s;uch an extraor|dinary &s;pectacle, Bihn-goh under|went a public trial, was unanimou&s;ly found guilty, and unanimou&s;ly de|clared innocent; by the &s;ame mouths condemned to death and recommen|ded to mercy: but mercy was in|compatible with the de&s;igns of the ad&mdash;n. The unfortunate Bihn-goh was crucified for cowardice, and bore his fate with the mo&s;t heroic courage. His behaviour at his death was &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with the crime
<PB N="101" REF="106">
for which he was doomed to die, that the emi&s;&s;aries of the Cuboy were fain to propagate a report, that Bihn-goh had bribed a per&s;on to repre&s;ent him at his execution, and be cruci|fied in his &s;tead.</P>
<P>This was a &s;tratagem very well calculated for the meridian of the Japone&s;e populace; and it would have &s;atisfied them intirely, had not their fears been concerned. But the Chine&s;e had for &s;ome time been threatening an inva&s;ion, the terror of which kept the people of Japan in perpetual agitation and di&s;quiet. They neglected their bu&s;ine&s;s; and ran about in di&s;traction, inquiring news, li&s;tening to reports, &s;taring, whi&s;pering, whimpering, clamour|ing, neglecting their food and re|nouncing their repo&s;e. The Dairo, who believed the Tartars of Ye&s;&s;o (from whom he him&s;elf was de|&s;cended) had more valour, and &s;kill and hone&s;ty, than was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by
<PB N="102" REF="107">
any other nation on earth, took a large body of them into his pay, and brought them over to the i&s;|land of Niphon, for the defence of his Japone&s;e dominions. The truth is, he had a &s;trong predilecti|on for that people: he had been nur&s;ed among them, and &s;ucked it from the nipple. His father had &s;ucceeded as heir to a paultry farm in that country; and there he fitted up a cabin, which he preferred to all the palaces of Meaco and Jeddo. The &s;on received the fir&s;t rudiments of his education among the&s;e Tar|tars, who&s;e country had given birth to his progenitor Bupo. He there|fore loved their country; he admired their manners, becau&s;e they were conformable to his own; and he was in particular captivated by the ta&s;te they &s;hewed in trimming and curling their muftachios.</P>
<P>In full belief that the Ye&s;&s;ites &s;tood as high in the e&s;timation of his Ja|pone&s;e
<PB N="103" REF="108">
&s;ubjects, as in his own, he imported a body of them into Ni|phon, where, at fir&s;t, they were re|ceived as &s;aviours and protectors; but the apprehen&s;ion of danger no &s;ooner vani&s;hed, than they were ex|po&s;ed to a thou&s;and in&s;ults and mor|tifications ari&s;ing from the natural prejudice to foreigners, which pre|vails among the people of Japan. They were reviled, calumniated, and maltreated in every different form, by every cla&s;s of people; and when the &s;evere &s;ea&s;on &s;et in, the Japone&s;e refu&s;ed &s;helter from the extremities of the weather, to tho&s;e very auxi|liaries they had hired to defend every thing that was dear to them, from the &s;words of an enemy whom they them&s;elves dur&s;t not look in the face. In vain Fika-kaka employed a double band of arti&s;ts to tickle their no&s;es. They &s;hut their eyes, indeed, as u&s;ual: but their eyes no &s;ooner clo|&s;ed, than their mouths opened, and
<PB N="104" REF="109">
out flew the tropes and figures of ob|loquy and execration. They ex|claimed, that they had not bought, but caught the Tartar; that they had hired the wolves to guard the &s;heep; that they were &s;imple bea&s;ts who could not defend them&s;elves from the dog with their own horns; but what could be expected from a flock which was led by &s;uch a pu&s;illanimous bell|weather?&mdash;In a word, the Ye&s;&s;ites were &s;ent home in di&s;grace: but the &s;erment did not &s;ub&s;ide; and the conduct of the admini&s;tration was &s;ummoned before the venerable tri|bunal of the populace.</P>
<P>There was one Taycho, who had rai&s;ed him&s;elf to great con&s;ideration in this &s;elf-con&s;tituted college of the mob. He was di&s;tingui&s;hed by a loud voice, an unaba&s;hed counte|nance, a fluency of abu&s;e, and an intrepidity of oppo&s;ition to the mea|&s;ures of the Cuboy, who was far from being a favourite with the ple|beians.
<PB N="105" REF="110">
Orator Taycho's eloquence was admirably &s;uited to his audience; he roared, and he brayed, and he bellowed again&s;t the m&mdash;r: he threw out per&s;onal &s;arca&s;ms again&s;t the Dai|ro him&s;elf. He inveighed again&s;t his partial attachment to the land of Ye&s;&s;o, which he had more than once manife&s;ted to the detriment of Ja|pan: he inflamed the national pre|judice again&s;t foreigners; and as he profe&s;&s;ed an inviolable zeal for the commons of Japan, he became the fir&s;t demagogue of the empire. The truth is, he generally happened to be on the right &s;ide. The partiality of the Dairo, the errors, ab&s;urdities, and corruption of the mini&s;try, pre&s;ented &s;uch a palpable mark as could not be mi&s;&s;ed by the arrows of his declamation. This Cerberus had been &s;ilenced more than once with a &s;op; but whether his appetite was not &s;atisfied to the full, or he was &s;till &s;timulated by the turbulence of
<PB N="106" REF="111">
his di&s;po&s;ition, which would not al|low him to re&s;t, he began to &s;hake his chains anew, and open in the old cry; which was a &s;pecies of mu&s;ick to the mob, as agreeable as the &s;ound of a bagpipe to a mountaineer of North Britain, or the &s;trum-&s;trum to the &s;warthy natives of Angola. It was a &s;train which had the wonderful effect of effacing from the memory of his hearers, every idea of his for|mer &s;icklene&s;s and apo&s;tacy.</P>
<P>In order to weaken the effect of orator Taycho's harangues, the Cu|boy had found means to intrude up|on the councils of the mob, a native of Ximo called Mura-clami, who had acquired &s;ome reputation for elo|quence, as an advocate in the tribu|nals of Japan. He certainly po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed an uncommon &s;hare of penetra|tion, with a &s;ilver tone of voice, and a great magazines of words and phra&s;es, which flowed from him in a plea&s;ing tide of elocution. He
<PB N="107" REF="112">
had withal the art of &s;oothing, wheed|ling, in&s;inuating, and mi&s;repre&s;enting with &s;uch a degree of plau&s;ibility, that his talents were admired even by the few who had &s;en&s;e enough to detect his &s;ophi&s;try. He had no idea of principle, and no feeling of huma|nity. He had renounced the maxims of his family, after having turned them to the be&s;t account by execrat|ing the rites of Fakkuba&s;i or the White Hor&s;e, in private among mal|contents, while he wor&s;hipped him in public with the appearance of en|thu&s;ia&s;tic devotion. When detected in this double dealing, he fairly owned to the Cuboy, that he cur&s;ed the White Hor&s;e in private for his private intere&s;t, but that he &s;erved him in public from inclination.</P>
<P>The Cuboy had ju&s;t &s;en&s;e enough to perceive that he would always be true to his own intere&s;t; and there|fore he made it his intere&s;t to &s;erve the m&mdash;y to the full extent of his
<PB N="108" REF="113">
faculties. Accordingly Mura-clami fought a good battle with orator Tay|cho, in the occa&s;ional a&s;&s;emblies of the populace. But as it is much more ea&s;y to inflame than to allay, to accu&s;e than to acquit, to a&s;per&s;e than to purify, to unveil truth than to varni&s;h fal&s;hood; in a word, to patronize a good cau&s;e than to &s;up|port a bad one; the maje&s;ty of the mob &s;nuffed up the excrementitious &s;alts of Taycho's invectives, until their jugulars ached, while they re|jected with &s;igns of loathing the flowers of Mura-clami's elocution; ju&s;t as a citizen of Edinburgh &s;tops his no&s;e when he pa&s;&s;es by the &s;hop of a perfumer.</P>
<P>While the con&s;titution of human nature remains unchanged, &s;atire will be always better received than panegyric, in tho&s;e popular ha|rangues. The Athenians and Ro|mans were better plea&s;ed with the Philippics of Demo&s;thenes and Tully,
<PB N="109" REF="114">
than they would have been with all the prai&s;e tho&s;e two orators could have culled from the &s;tores of their elo|quence. A man feels a &s;ecret &s;atis|faction in &s;eeing his neighbour treated as a ra&s;cal. If he be a knave him|&s;elf, (which ten to one is the ca&s;e) he rejoices to &s;ee a character brought down to the level of his own, and a new member added to his &s;ociety; if he be one degree removed from ac|tual roguery, (which is the ca&s;e with nine-tenths of tho&s;e who enjoy the reputation of virtue) he indulges him|&s;elf with the Phari&s;aical con&s;olation, of thanking God he is not like that publican.</P>
<P>But, to return from this di|gre&s;&s;ion, Mura-clami, though he could not with all his talents main|tain any &s;ort of competition with Taycho, in the opinion of the mob; he, neverthele&s;s, took a more effec|tual method to weaken the force of his oppo&s;ition. He pointed out to
<PB N="110" REF="115">
Fika-kaka the proper means for amending the errors of his admini|&s;tration: he propo&s;ed mea&s;ures for pro&s;ecuting the war with vigour: he projected plans of conque&s;t in Fat&s;i&s;|&s;io; recommended active officers; forwarded expeditions; and infu&s;ed &s;uch a &s;pirit into the councils of Ja|pan, as had not before appeared for &s;ome centuries.</P>
<P>But his patron was precluded from the benefit of the&s;e mea&s;ures, by the ob&s;tinate prejudice and precipitation of the Dairo, who valued his Ye&s;&s;ian farm above all the empire of Japan. This precious mor&s;el of inheritance bordered upon the territories of a Tartar chief called Brut-an-tiffi, a famous freebooter, who had inured his Kurd to blood&s;hed, and enriched him&s;elf with rapine. Of all man|kind, he hated mo&s;t the Dairo, tho' his kin&s;man; and &s;ought a pretence for &s;eizing the farm, which in three days he could have made his own.
<PB N="111" REF="116">
The Dairo Gothama-baba was not ignorant of his &s;entiments. He trembled for his cabin when he con|&s;idered its &s;ituation between hawk and buzzard; expo&s;ed on one &s;ide to the talons of Brut-an-tiffi, and open on the other to the incur&s;ions of the Chine&s;e, under who&s;e au&s;pices the &s;aid Brut-an-tiffi had acted formerly as a zealous partizan. He had, in|deed, in a former quarrel exerted him&s;elf with &s;uch activity and ran|cour, to thwart the politics of the Dairo, and accumulate expences on the &s;ubjects of Niphon, that he was univer&s;ally dete&s;ted through the whole empire of Japan as a lawle&s;s robber, deaf to every &s;ugge&s;tion of humanity, re&s;pecting no law, re&s;tricted by no treaty, &s;coffing at all religion, goaded by ambition, in&s;tigated by cruelty, and attended by rapine.</P>
<P>In order to protect the farm from &s;uch a dangerous neighbour, Gotha|ma-baba, by an effort of &s;agacity pe|culiar
<PB N="112" REF="117">
to him&s;elf, granted a large &s;ub&s;idy from the trea&s;ury of Japan, to a remote nation of Mantchoux Tartars, on condition that they &s;hould march to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his farm, whenever it &s;hould be attacked. With the &s;ame &s;anity of fore&s;ight, the Dutch might engage in a defen&s;ive league with the Otto|man Porte, to &s;creen them from the attempts of the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian king, who is already on their frontiers. Brut-an-tiffi knew his advantage, and was re&s;olved to enjoy it. He had formed a plan of u&s;urpation, which could not be executed without con&s;i|derable &s;ums of money. He gave the Dairo to under&s;tand, he was per|fectly &s;en&s;ible how much the farm lay at his mercy: then propo&s;ed, that Got-hama-baba &s;hould renounce his &s;ub&s;idiary treaty with the Mantchoux; pay a yearly tribute to him Brut-an-tiffi, in con&s;ideration of his forbear|ing to &s;eize the farm; and maintain
<PB N="113" REF="118">
an army to protect it on the other &s;ide from the irruptions of the Chi|ne&s;e.</P>
<P>Got-hama-baba, alarmed at this declaration, began by his emi&s;&s;aries to &s;ound the inclinations of his Ja|pone&s;e &s;ubjects touching a continen|tal war, for the pre&s;ervation of the farm; but he found them totally aver&s;e to this wi&s;e &s;y&s;tem of politicks. Taycho, in particular, began to bawl and bellow among the mob, upon the ab&s;urdity of attempting to defend a remote cabin, which was not defen&s;ible; upon the iniquity of ruining a mighty empire, for the &s;ake of pre&s;erving a few barren acres, a naked common, a poor, pitiful, pelt|ing farm, the intere&s;t of which, like Aaron's rod, had already, on many oc|ca&s;ions, &s;wallowed up all regard and con&s;ideration for the advantage of Ja|pan. He inveighed again&s;t the &s;hameful and &s;en&s;ele&s;s partiality of Got-hama-baba: he mingled menaces with his
<PB N="114" REF="119">
repre&s;entations. He expatiated on the folly and pernicious tendency of a continental war: he enlarged upon the independence of Japan, &s;ecure in her in&s;ular &s;ituation. He declared, that not a man &s;hould be &s;ent to the continent, nor a &s;ub&s;idy granted to any greedy, mercenary, freebooting Tartar; and threatened, that if any corrupt mini&s;ter &s;hould dare to form &s;uch a connexion, he would hang it about his neck, like a mill&s;tone, to &s;ink him to perdition. The bellows of Taycho's oratory blew up &s;uch a flame in the nation, that the Cuboy and all his partizans were afraid to whi&s;per one &s;yllable about the farm.</P>
<P>Mean while Brut-an-tiffi, in order to quicken their determinations, withdrew the garri&s;on he had in a town on the frontiers of China, and it was immediately occupied by the Chine&s;e; an army of whom poured in like a deluge through this opening upon the lands adjoining to the farm.
<PB N="115" REF="120">
Got-hama-baba was now &s;eized with a &s;it of temporary di&s;traction. He foamed and raved, and cur&s;ed and &s;wore in the Tartarian language: he declared he would challenge Brut-an-tiffi to &s;ingle combat. He not only kicked, but al&s;o cuffed the whole council of Twenty-Eight, and played at foot-ball with his im|perial tiara. Fika-kaka was dumb-founded: Sti-phi-rum-poo muttered &s;omething about a commi&s;&s;ion of lu|nacy: Nin-kom-poo-po pronounced the words flat-bottomed junks; but his teeth chattered &s;o much, that his meaning could not be under&s;tood. The Fatzman offered to cro&s;s the &s;ea and put him&s;elf at the head of a body of light hor&s;e, to ob&s;erve the motions of the enemy; and Gotto-mio prayed fervently within him&s;elf, that God Almighty would be plea&s;ed to anni|hilate that accur&s;ed farm, which had been productive of &s;uch mi&s;chief to Japan. Nay, he even ventured to
<PB N="116" REF="121">
exclaim, <Q REND="inline">"Would to God, the farm was &s;unk in the middle of the Tar|tarian ocean!"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Heaven forbid! (cried the pre&s;ident Soo-&s;an-&s;in-o) for in that ca&s;e, Japan mu&s;t be at the expence of weighing it up again."</Q></P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this perplexity, they were &s;uddenly &s;urpri&s;ed at the apparition of Taycho's head nodding from a window that overlooked their deliberations. At &s;ight of this hor|rid &s;pectacle the council broke up. The Dairo fled to the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of the palace, and all his coun&s;ellors vani&s;hed, except the unfortunate Fi-ka-kaka, who&s;e fear had rendered him incapable of any &s;ort of motion but one, and that he in&s;tantly had to a very efficacious degree. Tay|cho bolting in at the window, ad|vanced to the Cuboy without cere|mony, and acco&s;ted him in the&s;e words: <Q REND="inline">"It depends upon the Cu|boy, whether Taycho continues to oppo&s;e his mea&s;ures, or becomes his

The fir&s;t &s;tep was made by an old fig-box, the &s;e|cond by a nightman's bucket, the third by a cask of hemp&s;eed, the fourth by a tar-barrel, the fifth by an empty kilderkin, the &s;ixth by a keg, the &s;eventh by a bag of &s;oot, the eighth by a fi&s;hwoman's basket, the ninth by a rotten pack-&s;addle, and the tenth by a block of hard wood from the i&s;land of Fat&s;i&s;&s;io. It was &s;upported on one &s;ide by a varni&s;hed lettered po&s;t, and on the other by a crazy hog&s;head. The artificers who erected this climax, and now exulted over it with hideous clamour, con&s;i&s;ted of grocers, &s;cavengers, hal|ter-makers,
<PB N="118" REF="123">
carpenters, draymen, di&s;tillers, chimney-&s;weepers, oy&s;ter-women, a&s;s-drivers, aldermen, and dealers in wa&s;te paper.&mdash;To make my&s;elf under&s;tood, I am obliged, Pea|cock, to make u&s;e of tho&s;e terms and denominations which are known in this metropolis.</P>
<P>Fika-kaka, having con&s;idered this work with a&s;toni&s;hment, and heard the populace declare upon oath, that they would exalt their orator above all competition, was again addre&s;&s;ed by the invincible Taycho. <Q REND="inline">"Your Quanbuku&s;hip perceives how boot|le&s;s it will be to &s;trive again&s;t the tor|rent.&mdash;What need is there of many words? admit me to a &s;hare of the admini&s;tration&mdash;I will commence your humble &s;lave&mdash;I will protect the farm at the expence of Japan, while there is an Oban left in the i&s;land of Niphon; and I will muz|zle the&s;e bears &s;o effectually, that they &s;hall not &s;hew their teeth, ex|cept

Fi|nally, he undertook to prepare the Dairo for his reception, and it was agreed that the orator &s;hould wait on his new colleague next morning.&mdash;This matter being &s;ettled to their mutual &s;atisfaction, Taycho retreated through the window into the court|yard, and was convoyed home in triumph by that many-headed hydra the mob, which &s;hook its multitudi|nous tail, and brayed through every throat with hideous exultation.</P>
<P>The Cuboy, mean while, had an|other trial to undergo, a trial which he had not fore&s;een. Taycho was no &s;ooner departed, than he hied him to the Dairo's cabinet, in order to communicate the happy &s;ucce&s;s of his negotiation. But at certain pe|riods, Got-hama-baba's re&s;entment was more than a match for any other pa&s;&s;ion that belonged to his di&s;po&s;i|tion, and now it was its turn to
<PB N="121" REF="126">
reign. The Dairo was made of very combu&s;tible materials, and the&s;e had been kindled up by the appearance of orator Taycho, who (he knew) had treated his per&s;on with indecent freedoms, and publickly vilified the wor&s;hip of the White Hor&s;e. When Fika-kaka, therefore, told him he had made peace with the demagogue, the Dairo, in&s;tead of giving him the kick of approbation, turned his own back upon the Cuboy, and &s;ilenced him with a <HI>boh!</HI> Had Fika-kaka a&s;|&s;ailed him with the &s;ame &s;yllogi&s;ti|cal &s;ophi&s;m which was u&s;ed by the Stagyrite to Alexander in a pa&s;&s;ion, perhaps he might have li&s;tened to rea&s;on: <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"An|ger &s;hould be rai&s;ed not by our equals, but by our &s;uperiors; but you have no equal."</Q>&mdash;Certain it is, that Got-hama-baba had no equal; but Fika-kaka was no more like Ari&s;|totle, than his ma&s;ter re&s;embled
<PB N="122" REF="127">
Alexander. The Dairo remained deaf to all his remon&s;trances, tears, and intreaties, until he declared that there was no other way of &s;aving the farm, but that of giving <HI>charte blanche</HI> to Taycho. This argument &s;eemed at once to di&s;pel the clouds which had been compelled by his in|dignation: he con&s;ented to receive the orator in quality of mini&s;ter, and next day was appointed for his intro|duction.</P>
<P>In the morning Taycho the Great repaired to the palace of the Cuboy, where he privately performed the ceremony of o&s;culation <HI>a po&s;teriori,</HI> &s;ung a &s;olemn Palinodia on the &s;ub|ject of political &s;y&s;tem, repeated and &s;igned the Buponian creed, embraced the religion of Fakkuba&s;i, and adored the White Hor&s;e with marks of un|feigned piety and contrition. Then he was conducted to the antichamber of the emperor, who could not, with|out great difficulty, &s;o far ma&s;ter
<PB N="123" REF="128">
his per&s;onal di&s;like, as to appear be|fore him with any degree of compo|&s;ure. He was brought forth by Fi|ka-kaka like a tame bear to the &s;take, if that epithet of <HI>tame</HI> can be given with any propriety to an animal which no body but his keeper dares approach. The orator perceiving him advance, made a low obei&s;ance according to the cu&s;tom of Japan, that is, by bending the body aver&s;e from the Dairo, and laying the right hand upon the left buttock; and pronounced with an audible voice, <Q REND="inline">"Behold, invincible Got-hama-ba|ba, a &s;incere penitent come to make atonement for his virulent oppo&s;ition to your government, for his atroci|ous in&s;olence to your &s;acred per&s;on. I have calumniated your favourite farm, I have que&s;tioned your inte|grity, I have vilified your charac|ter, ridiculed your under&s;tanding, and de&s;pi&s;ed your authority"</Q>&mdash;This recapitulation was &s;o di&s;agreeable to
<PB N="124" REF="129">
the Dairo, that he &s;uddenly flew off at a tangent, and retreated growling to his den; from whence he could by no means be lugged again by the Cuboy, until Taycho, exalting his voice, uttered the&s;e words:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"But I will exalt your authority more than ever it was deba&s;ed&mdash;I will extol your wi&s;dom, and expatiate on your genero&s;ity; I will glorify the White Hor&s;e, and &s;acrifice all the trea&s;ures of Japan, if needful, for the protec|tion of the farm of Ye&s;&s;o."</Q> By the&s;e cabali&s;tical &s;ounds the wrath of Got-hama-baba was intirely ap|pea&s;ed. He now returned with an air of gaiety, &s;trutting, &s;ideling, circling, fluttering, and cobbling like a turkey-cock in his pride, when he di&s;plays his &s;eathers to the &s;un. Taycho hailed the omen; and turning his face from the emperor, received &s;uch a &s;alutation on the <HI>os &s;acrum,</HI> that the parts continued vibrating and &s;ingling for &s;everal days.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="130">
An indenture tripartite was now drawn up and executed. Fika-kaka was continued trea&s;urer, with his levees, his Bonzas, and his places; and orator Taycho undertook, in the character of chief &s;cribe, to protect the farm of Ye&s;&s;o, as well as to bridle and manage the blatant bea&s;t who&s;e name was Legion. That a per&s;on of his kidney &s;hould have the pre|&s;umption to undertake &s;uch an affair, is not at all &s;urpri&s;ing; the wonder is, that his performance &s;hould even exceed his promi&s;e. The truth is, he promi&s;ed more than he could have performed, had not certain unfore|&s;een incidents, in which he had no concern, contributed towards the infatuation of the people.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t trial to which he brought his a&s;cendency over the mob, was his procuring from them a free gift, to enable the Dairo to arm his own private tenants in Ye&s;&s;o, together with &s;ome ragamuffin Tartars in the
<PB N="126" REF="131">
neighbourhood, for the defence of the farm. They winked &s;o hard up|on this fir&s;t over-act of his apo&s;|tacy, that he was fully per&s;uaded they had re&s;igned up all their &s;en&s;es to his direction; and re&s;olved to &s;hew them to all Europe, as a &s;urpri&s;ing in&s;tance of his art in mon&s;ter-tam|ing. This furious bea&s;t not only &s;uffered it&s;elf to be bridled and &s;ad|dled, but fri&s;ked and fawned, and purred and yelped, and crouched be|fore the orator, licking his feet, and pre&s;enting its back to the burthens which he was plea&s;ed to impo&s;e. Immediately after this fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay, Qamba-cun-dono the Fatzman was &s;ent over to a&s;&s;emble and command a body of light hor&s;e in Ye&s;&s;o, in or|der to keep an eye on the motions of the enemy; and indeed this vigilant and &s;agacious commander conducted him&s;elf with &s;uch activity and di&s;|cretion, that he &s;oon brought the war in tho&s;e parts to a point of ter|mination.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="132">
Mean while, Brut-an-tiffi conti|nuing to hover on the skirts of the farm, at the head of his myrmidons, and demanding of the Dairo a cate|gorical an&s;wer to the hints he had given, Got-hama-baba underwent &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive fits of impatience and di&s;traction. The Cuboy, in&s;ti|gated by his own partizans, and in particular by Mura-clami, who hoped to &s;ee Taycho take &s;ome de&s;perate &s;tep that would ruin his popularity; I &s;ay the Cuboy, thus &s;timulated, began to ply the orator with &s;uch pre&s;&s;ing intreaties as he could no lon|ger re&s;i&s;t; and now he exhibited &s;uch a &s;pecimen of his own power and the people's in&s;anity, as tran|&s;cends the flight of ordinary faith. Without taking the trouble to &s;cratch their long ears, tickle their no&s;es, drench them with mandragora or geneva, or make the lea&s;t apology for his own turning tail to the prin|ciples which he had all his life &s;o
<PB N="128" REF="133">
&s;trenuou&s;ly inculcated, he crammed down their throats an obligation to pay a yearly tribute to Brut-an|tiffi, in con&s;ideration of his forbear|ing to &s;eize the Dairo's farm; a tri|bute which amounted to &s;even times the value of the lands, for the de|fence of which it was payed. When I &s;aid <HI>crammed,</HI> I ought to have u&s;ed another phra&s;e. The bea&s;t, far from &s;hewing any &s;igns of loathing, clo&s;ed its eyes, opened its hideous jaws, and as it &s;wallowed the inglorious bond, wagged its tail in token of in|tire &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>No fritter on Shrove Tue&s;day was ever more dexterou&s;ly turned, than were the hydra's brains by this mountebank in patrioti&s;m, this jug|gler in politicks, this cat in pan, or cake in pan, or <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> in principle. Some people gave out that he dealt with a conjurer, and others &s;crupled not to in&s;inuate that he had &s;old him|&s;elf to the evil &s;pirit. But there was
<PB N="129" REF="134">
no occa&s;ion for a conjurer to deceive tho&s;e whom the daemon of folly had previou&s;ly confounded; and as to &s;elling, he &s;old nothing but the in|tere&s;t of his country; and of that he made a very bad bargain. Be that as it may, the Japone&s;e now viewed Brut-an-tiffi either through a new per&s;pective, or el&s;e &s;urveyed him with organs intirely metamorpho&s;ed. Ye&s;|terday they dete&s;ted him as a profli|gate ruffian lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of hone&s;ty and &s;hame, addicted to all manner of vice, a &s;coffer at religion, parti|cularly that of Fakkuba&s;i, the &s;courge of human nature, and the inveterate enemy of Japan. To-day, they glorified him as an unblemi&s;hed he|ro, the protector of good faith, the mirror of hone&s;ty, the pattern of every virtue, a &s;aint in piety, a de|vout votary to the White Hor&s;e, a friend to mankind, the fa&s;t ally and the firme&s;t prop of the Japone&s;e empire.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="135">
The farm of Ye&s;&s;o, which they had &s;o long execrated as a pu|trid and painful excre&s;cence upon the breech of their country, which would never be quiet until this cur&s;ed wart was either exterminated or taken away; they now fondled as a favourite mole, nay, and cheri&s;hed as the apple of their eye. One would have imagined that all the incon&s;i&s;t|encies and ab&s;urdities which charac|teri&s;e the Japone&s;e nation, had taken their turns to reign, ju&s;t as the in|tere&s;t of Taycho's ambition required. When it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to e&s;tabli&s;h new principles, at that very in&s;tant their levity prompted them to renounce their former maxims. Ju&s;t as he had occa&s;ion to fa&s;cinate their &s;en&s;es, the daemon of caprice in&s;tigated them to &s;hut their eyes, and hold out their necks, that they might be led by the no&s;e. At the very nick of time when he adopted the cau&s;e of Brut-an-tiffi, in diame|trical
<PB N="131" REF="136">
oppo&s;ition to all his former profe&s;&s;ions, the &s;pirit of whim and &s;ingularity di&s;po&s;ed them to kick again&s;t the &s;hins of common &s;en&s;e, deny the light of day at noon, and receive in their bo&s;oms as a dove, the man before whom they had &s;hunned as a &s;erpent. Thus every thing con|curred to e&s;tabli&s;h for orator Tay|cho, a de&s;poti&s;m of popularity; and that not planned by rea&s;on, or rai&s;ed by art, but founded on fatality and fini&s;hed by accident. <HI>Quos Jupiter vult perdere pri&ugrave;s dementat.</HI></P>
<P>Brut-an-tiffi being &s;o amply gra|tified by the Japone&s;e for his promi&s;e of forbearance with re&s;pect to the farm of Ye&s;&s;o, and determined, at all events, to make &s;ome new acqui|&s;ition, turned his eyes upon the do|mains of Pol-ha&s;&s;an-akou&s;ti, an|other of his neighbours, who had formed a mo&s;t beautiful colony in this part of Tartary; and ru&s;hed up|on it at a minute's warning. His
<PB N="132" REF="137">
re&s;olution in this re&s;pect was &s;o &s;ud|denly taken and quickly executed, that he had not yet formed any ex|cu&s;e for this outrage, in order to &s;ave appearances. Without giving him&s;elf the trouble to invent a pre|tence, he drove old Pol-ha&s;&s;an-a|kou&s;ti out of his re&s;idence; com|pelled the dome&s;tics of that prince to enter among his own banditti; plundered his hou&s;e, &s;eized the ar|chives of his family, threatened to &s;hoot the antient gentlewoman his wife, exacted heavy contribution from the tenants; then di&s;per&s;ed a manife&s;to in which he declared him|&s;elf the be&s;t friend of the &s;aid Akou&s;ti and his &s;pou&s;e, a&s;&s;uring him he would take care of his e&s;tate as a precious depo&s;it to be re&s;tored to him in due &s;ea&s;on. In the mean time, he thought proper to &s;eque&s;ter the rents, that they might not enable Pol-ha&s;&s;an to take any mea&s;ures that &s;hould con|duce to his own prejudice. As for
<PB N="133" REF="138">
the articles of meat, drink, clothing, and lodging, for him and his wife and a large family of &s;mall children, he had nothing to do but depend upon Providence, until the pre&s;ent troubles &s;hould be appea&s;ed. His behaviour on this occa&s;ion, Peacock, puts me in mind of the Spaniard whom Philip II. employed to a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inate his own &s;on Don Carlos. This compa&s;&s;ionate Ca&s;tilian, when the prince began to deplore his fate, twirled his mu&s;tachio, pronouncing with great gravity the&s;e words of comfort: <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Calla, calla, Senor, todo que &s;e haze es por &s;u bien.</HI>"</Q>  <Q REND="inline">"I beg your highne&s;s won't make any noi&s;e; this is all for your own good:"</Q> or the politene&s;s of Gibbet in the play called the Beaux Stratagem, who &s;ays to Mrs. Sullen, <Q REND="inline">"Your jewels, Ma|dam, if you plea&s;e&mdash;don't be under any unea&s;ine&s;s, Madam&mdash;if you make any noi&s;e, I &s;hall blow your brains out&mdash;I have a particular regard for the ladies, Madam."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="139">
But the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Pol-ha&s;&s;an's deme&s;nes was not the ultimate aim of Brut-an-tiffi. He had an eye to a fair and fertile province belonging to a Tartar prince&s;s of the hou&s;e of O&s;trog. He &s;aw him&s;elf at the head of a numerous banditti trained to war, fle&s;hed in carnage, and eager for rapine; his coffers were filled with the &s;poils he had gathered in his former freebooting expeditions; and the incredible &s;ums payed him as an annual tribute from Japan, added to his other advantages, ren|dered him one of the mo&s;t formi|dable chiefs in all Tartary. Thus elated with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own &s;trength, he re&s;olved to make a &s;udden irruption into the dominions of O&s;trog, at a &s;ea&s;on of the year when that hou&s;e could not avail it&s;elf of the alliances they had formed with other powers; and he did not doubt but that, in a few weeks, he &s;hould be able to &s;ubdue the whole
<PB N="135" REF="140">
country belonging to the Amazonian prince&s;s. But I can tell thee, Pea|cock, his views extended even far|ther than the conque&s;t of the O&s;trog dominions. He even a&s;pired at the empire of Tartary, and had formed the de&s;ign of depo&s;ing the great Cham, who was intimately connected with the prince&s;s of O&s;trog. In&s;pired by the&s;e projects, he, at the beginning of winter, &s;uddenly poured like a deluge into one of the provinces that owned this Amazon's &s;way; but he had hardly gained the pa&s;&s;es of the mountains, when he found him&s;elf oppo&s;ed by a numerous body of forces, a&s;&s;embled under the com|mand of a celebrated general, who gave him battle without he&s;itation, and handled him &s;o roughly, that he was fain to retreat into the de|me&s;nes of Pol-ha&s;&s;an, where he &s;pent the greate&s;t part of the winter in exacting contributions and ex|tending the reign of de&s;olation.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="141">
All the petty princes and &s;tates who hold of the great Cham, began to tremble for their dominions, and the Cham him&s;elf was &s;o much alarmed at the lawle&s;s proceedings of Brut-an-tiffi, that he convoked a general a&s;&s;embly of all the poten|tates who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed fiefs in the em|pire, in order to deliberate upon mea&s;ures for re&s;training the ambition of this ferocious freebooter. Among others, the Dairo of Japan, as lord of the farm of Ye&s;&s;o, &s;ent a deputy to this convention, who, in his ma&s;|ter's name, &s;olemnly di&s;claimed and profe&s;&s;ed his dete&s;tation of Brut-an-tiffi's proceedings, which, indeed, were univer&s;ally condemned. The truth is, he, at this period, dreaded the re&s;entment of all the other co|e&s;tates rather more than he feared the menaces of Brut-an-tiffi; and, in particular, apprehended a &s;entence of outlawry from the Cham, by which at once he would have for|feited
<PB N="137" REF="142">
all legal title to his beloved farm. Brut-an-tiffi, on the other hand, began to rai&s;e a piteous cla|mour, as if he meant to excite com|pa&s;&s;ion. He declared him&s;elf a poor injured prince, who had been a dupe to the hone&s;ty and humanity of his own heart. He affirmed that the Amazon of O&s;trog had entered into a con&s;piracy again&s;t him, with the Mantchoux Tartars, and prince Akou&s;ti: he publi&s;hed particulars of this dreadful conjuration, which ap|peared to be no other than a defen|&s;ive alliance formed in the apprehen|&s;ion that he would fall upon &s;ome of them, without any regard to treaty, as he had done on a former occa&s;ion, when he &s;eized one of the Amazon's be&s;t provinces. He publickly taxed the Dairo of Japan with having prompted him to commence ho&s;ti|lities, and hinted that the &s;aid Dairo was to have &s;hared his conque&s;ts. He openly intreated his co-e&s;tates to
<PB N="138" REF="143">
interpo&s;e their influence towards the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of peace in the em|pire; and gave them privately to under&s;tand, that he would ravage their territories without mercy, &s;hould they concur with the Cham in any &s;entence to his prejudice.</P>
<P>As he had mi&s;carried in his fir&s;t at|tempt, and perceived a terrible cloud gathering around him, in all proba|bility he would have been glad to compound matters at this juncture, on condition of being left in <HI>&s;tatu quo;</HI> but this was a condition not to be obtained. The prince&s;s of O&s;|trog had by this time formed &s;uch a confederacy, as threatened him with utter de&s;truction. She had contracted an offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive alliance with the Chine&s;e, the Mantchoux, and the Serednee Tartars; and each of the&s;e powers engaged to furni&s;h a &s;eparate army to humble the in&s;o|lence of Brut-an-tiffi. The majority of the Tartar fiefs agreed to rai&s;e a
<PB N="139" REF="144">
body of forces to act again&s;t him as a di&s;turber of the publick peace; the great Cham threatened him with a decree of outlawry and rebellion; and the Amazon her&s;elf oppo&s;ed him at the head of a very numerous and warlike tribe, which had always been con&s;idered as the mo&s;t formi|dable in that part of Tartary. Thus powerfully &s;u&s;tained, &s;he re&s;olved to enjoy her revenge; and at any rate retrieve the province which had been ravi&s;hed from her by Brut-an-tiffi, at a time when &s;he was embarra&s;&s;ed with other difficulties. Brut-an-tiffi did not think him&s;elf &s;o reduced as to pur|cha&s;e peace with &s;uch a &s;acrifice. The Mantchoux were at a great di&s;tance, naturally &s;low in their motions, and had a very long march through a de|&s;ert country, which they would not attempt without having fir&s;t provided prodigious magazines. The Sered|nee were a divided people, among whom he had made &s;hift to foment
<PB N="140" REF="145">
inte&s;tine divi&s;ions, that would im|pede the national operations of the war. The Japone&s;e Fatzman formed a &s;trong barrier between him and the Chine&s;e; the army furni&s;hed by the fiefs, he de&s;pi&s;ed as raw, undi&s;ci|plined militia: be&s;ides, their de|claring again&s;t him afforded a &s;pe|cious pretence for laying their re|&s;pective dominions under contribu|tion. But he chiefly depended up|on the coffers of Japan, which he firmly believed would hold out until all his enemies &s;hould be utterly ex|hau&s;ted.</P>
<P>As this freebooter was a principal character in the drama which I in|tend to rehear&s;e, I &s;hall &s;ketch his portrait according to the information I received from a fellow-atom who once re&s;ided at his court, con&s;titu|ting part in one of the organs be|longing to his fir&s;t chamberlain. His &s;tature was under the middle &s;ize; his a&s;pect mean and forbid|ting,
<PB N="141" REF="146">
with a certain expre&s;&s;ion which did not at all prepo&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;pectator in favour of his morals. Had an ac|curate ob&s;erver beheld him without any exterior di&s;tinctions, in the &s;treets of this metropolis, he would have naturally clapped his hands to his pockets. Thou ha&s;t &s;een the cha|racter of Gibbet repre&s;ented on the &s;tage by a late comedian of expre&s;|&s;ive feature. Nature &s;ometimes makes a &s;trange contra&s;t between the interior workman&s;hip and the exte|rior form; but here the one reflected a true image of the other. His heart never felt an impre&s;&s;ion of tender|ne&s;s: his notions of right and wrong did not refer to any idea of benevo|lence, but were founded entirely on the convenience of human commerce; and there was nothing &s;ocial in the turn of his di&s;po&s;ition. By nature he was &s;tern, in&s;olent, and rapacious, uninfluenced by any motive of hu|manity; unawed by any precept of
<PB N="142" REF="147">
religion. With re&s;pect to religion, he took all opportunities of expo&s;ing it to ridicule and contempt. Liberty of con&s;cience he allowed to &s;uch ex|tent, as exceeded the bounds of de|corum and di&s;graced all legi&s;lation. He pardoned a criminal convicted of be&s;tiality, and publickly declared that all modes of religion, and every &s;pe|cies of amour, might be freely prac|ti&s;ed and pro&s;ecuted through all his dominions. His capacity was of the middling mould, and he had taken &s;ome pains to cultivate his under|&s;tanding. He had &s;tudied the Chi|ne&s;e language, which he &s;poke with fluency, and piqued him&s;elf upon his learning, which was but &s;uperficial. His temper was &s;o capricious and in|con&s;tant, that it was impo&s;&s;ible even for tho&s;e who knew him be&s;t, to fore|&s;ee any one particular of his per&s;onal demeanour. The &s;ame individual he would care&s;s and in&s;ult by turns, without the lea&s;t apparent change of
<PB N="143" REF="148">
circum&s;tance. He has been known to di&s;mi&s;s one of his favourites with particular marks of regard, and the mo&s;t flattering profe&s;&s;ions of affec|tion; and before he had time to pull off his bu&s;kins at his own hou&s;e, he has been hurried on hor&s;eback by a detachment of cavalry, and conveyed to the frontiers. Thus harra&s;&s;ed, without refre&s;hment or repo&s;e, he was brought back by another party, and reconveyed to the pre&s;ence of Brut-an-tiffi, who embraced him at meeting, and gently chid him for having been &s;o long ab&s;ent.&mdash;The fixed principles of this Tartar were the&s;e: in&s;atiable rapacity, re&s;tle&s;s ambition, and an in&s;uperable con|tempt for the Japone&s;e nation. His maxims of government were entirely de&s;potic. He con&s;idered his &s;ubjects as &s;laves, to be occa&s;ionally &s;acrificed to the accompli&s;hment of his capital de&s;igns; but, in the mean time, he indulged them with the protection
<PB N="142" REF="149">
of equitable laws, and encouraged them to indu&s;try for his own emolu|ment.</P>
<P>His virtues con&s;i&s;ted of tempe|rance, vigilance, activity, and per|&s;everance. His folly chiefly appeared in childi&s;h vanity and &s;elf-conceit. He amu&s;ed him&s;elf with riding, re|viewing his troops, reading Chine&s;e authors, playing on a mu&s;ical in&s;tru|ment in u&s;e among the Tartars, tri|fling with buffoons, conver&s;ing with &s;uppo&s;ed wits, and rea&s;oning with pretended philo&s;ophers: but he had no communication with the female &s;ex; nor, indeed, was there any ea&s;e, comfort, or enjoyment to be derived from a participation of his pa&s;time. His wits, philo&s;ophers, and buffoons, were compo&s;ed of Chine&s;e refugees, who &s;oon di&s;co|vered his weak &s;ide, and flattered his vanity to an incredible pitch of infa|tuation. They per&s;uaded him that he was an univer&s;al genius, an invin|cible

This they recommended with many hyperbolical encomiums to the peru&s;al of Brut-an-tiffi, who became enamoured of the perfor|mance, and was fired with the ambi|tion of rivalling, if not excelling Ra&s;kalander, not only as a warrior, but likewi&s;e as a patron of ta&s;te and

a protector of the liberal arts. As Alexander depo&s;ited Homer's Iliad in a precious ca&s;ket; &s;o Brut-an-tiffi procured a golden box for pre|&s;erving this &s;ophi&s;tication of Quintus Curtius.

<P>Thus pampered with adulation and intoxicated with dreams of con|que&s;t, he made no doubt of being able to e&s;tabli&s;h a new empire in Tartary, which &s;hould entirely eclip&s;e the kingdom of Tum-ming-qua, and rai&s;e a reputation that &s;hould infi|nitely tran&s;cend the fame of Yan, or any emperor that ever &s;at upon the throne of Thibet. He now took the field again&s;t the Amazon of the hou&s;e of O&s;trog; penetrated into her domi|nions; defeated one of her generals in a pitched battle; and undertook the &s;iege of one of her principal

cities, in full confidence of &s;eeing her kneeling at his gate before the end of the campaign. In the mean time, her &s;cattered troops were rallied and reinforced by another old, experi|enced commander, who being well acquainted with the genius of his adver&s;ary, pitched upon an advan|tageous &s;ituation, where he waited for another attack. Brut-an-tiffi, flu&s;hed with his former victory, and firmly per&s;uaded that no mortal power could with&s;tand his prowe&s;s, gave him battle at a very great di&s;|advantage. The con&s;equence was natural:&mdash;he lo&s;t great part of his ar|my; was obliged to abandon the &s;iege, and retreat with di&s;grace. A &s;eparate body, commanded by one of his able&s;t captains, met with the &s;ame fate in a neighbouring coun|try; and a third detachment at the farthe&s;t extremity of his dominions, having attacked an army of the

Mantchoux, was repul&s;ed with great lo&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e were not all the mortifica|tions to which he was expo&s;ed about this period. The Fatzman of Japan, who had formed an army for the de|fence of the farm of Ye&s;&s;o again&s;t the Chine&s;e, met with a terrible di&s;a&s;ter. Notwith&s;tanding his being outnum|bered by the enemy, he exhibited many proofs of uncommon activity and va|lour. At length they came to blows with him, and handled him &s;o roughly, that he was fain to retreat from po&s;t to pillar, and leave the farm at their mercy. Had he pur|&s;ued his route to the right, he might have found &s;helter in the dominions of Brut-an-tiffi, and this was his in|tention; but, in&s;tead of marching in a &s;traight line, he revolved to the right, like a planet round the &s;un, impelled as it were by a compound impul&s;e, until he had de&s;cribed a re|gular
<PB N="149" REF="154">
&s;emicircle; and then he found him&s;elf with all his followers en|gaged in a &s;heep-pen, from whence there was no egre&s;s; for the enemy, who followed his &s;teps, immediately blocked up the entrance. The un|fortunate Fatzman being thus pound|ed, mu&s;t have fallen a &s;acrifice to his centripetal force, had not he been delivered by the interpo&s;ition of a neighbouring chief, who prevailed upon the Chine&s;e general to let Quamba-cun-dono e&s;cape, provided his followers would lay down their arms, and return peaceably to their own habitations. This was a bitter pill, which the Fatzman was obliged to &s;wallow, and is &s;aid to have co&s;t him five &s;tone of &s;uet. He returned to Japan in ob&s;curity; the Chine&s;e general took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the farm in the name of his emperor; and all the damage which the tenants &s;u&s;|tained, was nothing more than a

<P>To the thinking part of the Japa|ne&s;e, nothing could be more agree|able than this event, by which they were at once delivered from a perni|cious excre&s;cence, which, like an ulcerated tumour, exhau&s;ted the juices of the body by which it was fed. Brut-an-tiffi con&s;idered the tran&s;action in a different point of view. He fore&s;aw that the Chine&s;e forces would now be at liberty to join his enemies, the tribe of O&s;|trog, with whom the Chine&s;e empe|ror was intimately connected; and that it would be next to impo&s;&s;ible to with&s;tand the joint efforts of the confederacy, which he had brought upon his own head. He therefore rai&s;ed a hideous clamour. He ac|cu&s;ed the Fatzman of mi&s;conduct, and in&s;i&s;ted, not without a mixture of menaces, upon the Dairo's rea&s;|&s;embling

<P>The Dairo him&s;elf was incon&s;ol|able. He neglected his food, and re|fu&s;ed to confer with his mini&s;ters. He di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the Fatzman from his &s;ervice.

<P><PB N="162" REF="167">
You mu&s;t know, Peacock, I had by this time changed my &s;ituation. I was di&s;charged in the per&s;piratory vapour from the perinaeum of the Cuboy, and &s;ucked into the lungs of Mura-clami, through which I pervaded into the cour&s;e of the cir|culation, and vi&s;ited every part of his compo&s;ition. I found the brain &s;o full and compact, that there was not room for another particle of matter. But in&s;tead of a heart, he had a membranous &s;ac, or hollow vi&s;cus, cold and callous, the habi|tation of &s;neaking caution, &s;ervile flattery, griping avarice, creeping malice, and treacherous deceit. Among the&s;e tenants it was my fate to dwell; and there I di&s;covered the motives by which the lawyer's con|duct was influenced. He now &s;e|cretly rejoiced at the pre&s;umption of Taycho, which he hoped had already prompted him to undertake

more than he could perform; in which ca&s;e he would infallibly in|cur di&s;grace either with the Dairo or the people. It is not impo&s;&s;ible but this hope might have been re|alized, had not fortune unexpectedly interpo&s;ed, and operated as an aux|illiary to the orator's pre&s;umption. Succe&s;s began to dawn upon the arms of Japan in the i&s;land of Fat&s;i&s;io; and towards the end of the campaign, Brut-an-tiffi obtained two petty advantages in Tartary again&s;t one body of Chine&s;e, and an|other of the O&s;trog. All the&s;e were magnified into a&s;toni&s;hing victories, and a&s;cribed to the wi&s;dom and courage of Taycho, becau&s;e during his mini&s;try they were obtained; though he neither knew why, nor wherefore; and was in this re&s;pect as innocent as his ma&s;ter Got-hama-baba, and his colleague Fika-kaka. He had penetration enough to per|ceive,

however, that the&s;e events had intoxicated the rabble, and began to pervert their ideas. Succe&s;s of any kind is apt to perturb the weak brain of a Japone&s;e; but the ac|qui&s;ition of any military trophy, produces an actual delirium.&mdash;The &s;treets of Meaco were filled with the multitudes who &s;houted, whooped, and hollowed. They made proce&s;|&s;ions with flags and banners; they illuminated their hou&s;es; they extolled Ian-on-i, a provincial captain of Fat&s;i|&s;io, who had by accident repul&s;ed a bo|dy of the enemy, and reduced an old barn which they had fortified. They magnified Brut-an-tiffi; they deified orator Taycho; they drank, they damned, they &s;quabbled, and acted a thou&s;and extravagancies which I &s;hall not pretend to enumerate or particularize.

Such were the propo&s;itions orator Taycho undertook to demon&s;trate; and the &s;ucce&s;s ju&s;tified his under|taking. After a weak mind has been duly prepared, and turned as it were, by opening a &s;luice or torrent of high-&s;ounding words, the greater the contradiction propo&s;ed the &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion it makes, becau&s;e it in|crea&s;es the puzzle, and lays fa&s;t hold on the admiration; depo&s;iting the &s;mall proportion of rea&s;on with which it was before impregnated, like the vitriol acid in the copper-mines of Wicklow, into which if you im|mer&s;e iron, it immediately quits the copper which it had before di&s;&s;olved, and unites with the other metal, to which it has a &s;trongerattraction.&mdash;Orator Taycho was not &s;o well &s;kil|led in logic as to amu&s;e his audience with definitions of concrete and ab|&s;tract terms; or expatiate upon the genus and the difference; or &s;tate

propo&s;itions by the &s;ubject, the pre|dicate, and the copula; or form &s;yl|logi&s;ms by mood and figure: but he was perfectly well acquainted with all the equivocal or &s;ynonimous words in his own language, and could ring the changes on them with great dex|terity. He knew perfectly well how to expre&s;s the &s;ame ideas by words that literally implied oppo&s;ition:&mdash;for example, a valuable conque&s;t or an invaluable conque&s;t; a &s;hameful ra&s;cal or a &s;hameful villain; a hard head or a &s;oft head; a large con|&s;cience or no con&s;cience; immen&s;ely great or immen&s;ely little; damned high or damned low; damned bit|ter, damned &s;weet; damned &s;evere, damned in&s;ipid; and damned ful|&s;ome. He knew how to invert the &s;en&s;e of words by changing the manner of pronunciation; e. g. <Q REND="inline">"You are a very pretty fellow!"</Q> to &s;ignify, <Q REND="inline">"You are a very dirty &s;coundrel."&mdash;</Q>

words infidel, here&s;y, good man, and political orthodoxy, imply very different &s;ignifications, among different cla&s;&s;es of people. A Mu&s;|&s;ulman is an infidel at Rome, and a Chri&s;tian is di&s;tingui&s;hed as an un|believer at Con&s;tantinople.

Political orthodoxy has different, nay oppo&s;ite definitions, at different places in the &s;ame kingdom; at O&mdash;and C&mdash;; at the Cocoa-tree in Pall|mall; and at Garraway's in Ex|change-alley. Our orator was well acquainted with all the legerdemain of his own language, as well as with the nature of the bea&s;t he had to rule. He knew when to di&s;tract its

weak brain with a tumult of incon|gruous and contradictory ideas: he knew when to overwhelm its feeble faculty of thinking, by pouring in a torrent of words without any ideas annexed. The&s;e throng in like city|milliners to a Mile-end a&s;&s;embly, while it happens to be under the di|rection of a conductor without &s;trength and authority. Tho&s;e that have ideas annexed may be compared to the females provided with partners, which, though they may croud the place, do not ab&s;olutely de&s;troy all regulation and decorum. But tho&s;e that are uncoupled, pre&s;s in promi&s;|cuou&s;ly with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity and in &s;uch numbers, that the puny ma&s;ter of the ceremonies is unable to with|&s;tand the irruption; far le&s;s, to di&s;|tingui&s;h their quality, or accommo|date them with partners: thus they fall into the dance without order, and immediately anarchy en&s;ues.

Taycho having kept the mon&s;ter's brain on a &s;immer, until, like the cow-heel in Don Quixote, it &s;eemed to cry, <HI>Comenme, comenme;</HI> Come, eat me, come, eat me; then told them in plain terms, that it was ex|pedient they &s;hould part with their wives and their children, their &s;ouls and their bodies, their &s;ub&s;tance and their &s;en&s;es, their blood and their &s;uet, in order to defend the indefen|&s;ible farm of Ye&s;&s;o, and to &s;upport Brut-an-tiffi, their in&s;upportable ally.&mdash;The hydra, rolling it&s;elf in the du&s;t, turned up its huge unwieldy paunch and wagged its forky tail; then licked the feet of Taycho, and through all its hoar&s;e di&s;cordant throats, began to bray applau&s;e. The Dairo rejoiced in his &s;ucce&s;s, the fir&s;t-fruits of which con&s;i&s;ted in their agreeing to maintain an army of twenty thou&s;and Tartar mercenaries, who were reinforced by the flower of
<PB N="174" REF="179">
the national troops of Japan, &s;ent over to defend the farm of Ye&s;&s;o; and in their con&s;enting to prolong the annual tribute granted to Brut-an-tiffi, who, in return for this con|de&s;cen&s;ion, accommodated the Dairo with one of his free-booting captains to command the Ye&s;&s;ite army. This new general had &s;een &s;ome &s;ervice, and was counted a good officer: but it was not &s;o much on account of his military character that he ob|tained this command, as for his dexterity in prolonging the war; his &s;kill in exerci&s;ing all the diffe|rent arts of peculation; and his at|tachment to Brut-an-tiffi, with whom he had agreed to co-operate in milk|ing the Japone&s;e cow. This plan they executed with &s;uch effect, as could not po&s;&s;ibly re&s;ult from addre&s;s alone, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by the infatuation of tho&s;e whom they pillaged. Every article of contingent expence for
<PB N="175" REF="180">
draught-hor&s;es, waggons, po&s;tage, forage, provi&s;ion, and &s;ecret &s;ervice, was &s;welled to &s;uch a degree as did violence to common &s;en&s;e as well as to common hone&s;ty. The general had a fellow-feeling with all the con|tractors in the army, who were con|nected with him in &s;uch a manner as &s;eemed to preclude all po&s;&s;ibility of detection. In vain &s;ome of the Japone&s;e officers endeavoured to pry into this my&s;terious commerce; in vain in&s;pectors were appointed by the government of Japan. The fir&s;t were removed on different pretences: the la&s;t were encountered by &s;uch di&s;|graces and di&s;couragements, as in a little time compelled them to re&s;ign the office they had undertaken. In a word, there was not a private mer|cenary Tartar &s;oldier in this army who did not co&s;t the empire of Ja|pan as much as any &s;ubaltern officer of its own; and the annual charge of
<PB N="176" REF="181">
this continental war, undertaken for the protection of the farm of Ye&s;&s;o, exceeded the whole expence of any former war which Japan had ever maintained on its own account &s;ince the beginning of the empire: nay, it was attended with one cir|cum&s;tance which rendered it &s;till more in&s;upportable. The money ex|pended in armaments and operations, equipped and pro&s;ecuted on the &s;ide of Japan, was all circulated with|in the empire; &s;o that it &s;till remain|ed u&s;eful to the community in ge|neral; but no in&s;tance could be pro|duced, of a &s;ingle copan that ever returned from the continent of Tar|tary; therefore all the &s;ums &s;ent thither, were clear lo&s;s to the &s;ub|jects of Japan. Orator Taycho acted as a faithful ally to Brut-an-tiffi, by &s;tretching the ba&s;s-&s;trings of the mobile in &s;uch a manner, as to be always in concert with the extrava|gance
<PB N="177" REF="182">
of the Tartar's demands, and the ab&s;urdity of the Dairo's predilection. Fika-kaka was a&s;toni&s;hed at the&s;e phaenomena; while Mura-clami hop|ed in &s;ecret, that the orator's brain was di&s;ordered; and that his in&s;anity would &s;oon &s;tand confe&s;&s;ed, even to the conviction of the people.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"If, (&s;aid he to him&s;elf) they are not altogether de&s;titute of human rea&s;on, they mu&s;t, of their own accord, per|ceive and comprehend this plain pro|po&s;ition: A ca&s;k of water that di&s;|charges <HI>three</HI> by one pipe, and re|ceives no more than <HI>two</HI> by another, mu&s;t infallibly be emptied at the long-run.

He had endea|voured to inve&s;tigate the &s;en&s;e, but he had never fathomed the ab&s;urdi|ties of human nature. All that Tay|cho had done for Ye&s;&s;o, amounted not to one-third of what was required for the annual expence of Japan while it maintained the war again&s;t China in different quar|ters of A&s;ia. A former Cuboy, (re&s;t his &s;oul!) finding it impo&s;&s;ible to rai&s;e within the year the exorbitant &s;up|plies that were required to gratify the avarice and ambition of the Dai|ro, had contrived the method of funding, which hath been lately adopted with &s;uch remarkable &s;uc|ce&s;s in this kingdom. You know, Peacock, this is no more than borrowing a certain &s;um on the credit of the nation, and laying a
<PB N="179" REF="184">
fre&s;h tax upon the public, to defray the intere&s;t of every &s;um thus borrowed; an excellent expedient, when kept within due bounds, for &s;ecuring the e&s;tabli&s;hed government, multiplying the dependants of the m&mdash;ry, and throwing all the money of the empire into the hands of the admini&s;tration. But tho&s;e loans were &s;o often repeated, that the national debt had already &s;welled to an enor|mous burthen; &s;uch a variety of taxes was laid upon the &s;ubject, as grievou&s;ly inhanced all the nece&s;&s;a|ries of life; con&s;equently the poor were di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and the price of la|bour was rai&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, that the Japone&s;e manufactures were every-where under&s;old by the Chi|ne&s;e traders, who employed their workmen at a more moderate ex|pence. Taycho, in this dilemma, was &s;eized with a &s;trange conceit. Alchemy was at that period become a fa|vourite

&s;tudy in Japan. Some bonzas having more learning and avarice than their brethren, applied them|&s;elves to the &s;tudy of certain Chal|dean manu&s;cripts, which their ance&s;|tors had brought from A&s;&s;yria; and in the&s;e they found the &s;ub&s;tance of all that is contained in the works of Hermes Tri&s;megi&s;tus, Geber, Zo&s;ymus, the Panapolite, Olympio|dorus, Heliodorus, Agathodaemon, Morienus, Albertus Magnus, and, above all, your countryman Roger Bacon, who adopted Geber's opinion, that mercury is the common ba&s;is, and &s;ulphur the cement of all me|tals. By the bye, this &s;ame friar Bacon was well acquainted with the compo&s;ition of gun-powder, though the reputation ari&s;ing from the di&s;covery, has been given to Swartz, who lived many years af|ter that monk of We&s;tmin&s;ter.

The whole evaporated in &s;moke, without leaving &s;o much as the &s;crapings of a crucible for a &s;pecific again&s;t the itch.

He compo&s;ed a me&s;s that &s;hould fill their bellies, and, at the &s;ame time, protract the intoxication of their brains, which it was &s;o much his intere&s;t to maintain.&mdash;He put them upon a diet of yea&s;t; where this did not agree with the &s;to|mach, he employed his emi&s;&s;aries to blow up the patients <HI>&agrave; po&s;teriori,</HI> as the dog was blown up by the madman of Seville, recorded by Cer|vantes.
<PB N="183" REF="188">
The individuals thus inflat|ed were &s;een &s;waggering about the &s;treets, &s;mooth and round, and &s;leek and jolly, with leering eyes and flo|rid complexion. Every one &s;eemed to have the <HI>os magna &s;onaturum.</HI> He &s;trutted with an air of impor|tance. He broke wind, and broach|ed new &s;y&s;tems. He declared as if by revelation, that the more debt the public owed, the richer it be|came; that food was not nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of life; nor an in|tercour&s;e of the &s;exes required for the propagation of the &s;pecies. He ex|patiated on yea&s;t, as the nectar of the gods, that would &s;u&s;tain the animal machine, fill the human mind with divine in&s;piration, and confer im|mortality. From the efficacy of this &s;pecific, he began to prophe&s;y con|cerning the White Hor&s;e, and de|clared him&s;elf an apo&s;tle of Bupo.&mdash;Thus they &s;trolled through the
<PB N="184" REF="189">
i&s;land of Niphon, barking and preach|ing the go&s;pel of Fakku-ba&s;i, and pre|&s;enting their barm goblets to all who were in que&s;t of political &s;alvation. The people had been &s;o well prepared for infatuation, by the &s;peeches of Tay|cho, and the tidings of &s;ucce&s;s from Tartary, that every pa&s;&s;enger greedi|ly &s;wallowed the drench, and in a little time the whole nation was con|verted; that is, they were totally freed from tho&s;e trouble&s;ome and im|pertinent faculties of rea&s;on and re|flection, which could have &s;erved no other purpo&s;e but to make them mi|&s;erable under the burthens to which their backs were now &s;ubjected. They offered up all their gold and &s;ilver, their jewels, their furniture and apparel, at the &s;hrine of Fakku|ba&s;i, &s;inging p&s;alms and hymns in prai&s;e of the White Hor&s;e. They put arms into the hands of their chil|dren, and drove them into Tartary,
<PB N="185" REF="190">
in order to fatten the land of Ye&s;&s;o with their blood. They grew fana|tics in that cau&s;e, and wor&s;hipped Brut-an-tiffi, as the favourite pro|phet of the beatified Bupo. All was &s;taggering, &s;taring, incoherence and contortion, exclamation and eruc|tation. Still this was no more than a temporary delirium, which might vani&s;h as the intoxicating effects of the yea&s;t &s;ub&s;ided. Taycho, there|fore, called in two reinforcements to the drench. He re&s;olved to &s;atiate their appetite for blood, and to amu&s;e their infantine vanity with the gew-gaws of triumph. He equipped out one armament at a con&s;iderable expence to make a de&s;cent on the coa&s;t of China, and &s;ent another at a much greater, to fight the enemy in Fat|&s;i&s;io. The commander of the fir&s;t di&s;embarked upon a de&s;olate i&s;land, demoli&s;hed an unfini&s;hed cottage, and brought away a few bunches of
<PB N="186" REF="191">
wild grapes. He afterwards hover|ed on the Chine&s;e coa&s;t; but was de|terred from landing by a very &s;ingu|lar phaenomenon. In &s;urveying the &s;hore, through &s;pying-gla&s;&s;es, he per|ceived the whole beach in&s;tanta|neou&s;ly fortified, as it were, with parapets of &s;and, which had e&s;caped the naked eye; and at one particular part, there appeared a body of gi|ants with very hideous features, peep|ing, as it were, from behind tho&s;e pa|rapets: from which circum&s;tances the Japone&s;e general concluded there was a very formidable ambu&s;cade, which he thought it would be mad|ne&s;s to encounter, and even folly to a&s;certain. One would imagine he had &s;een Homer's account of the Cy|clops, and did not think him&s;elf &s;afe, even at the di&s;tance of &s;ome miles from the &s;hore; for he pre&s;&s;ed the commander of the Fune to weigh anchor immediately, and retire to a
<PB N="187" REF="192">
place of more &s;afety.&mdash;I &s;hall now, Peacock, let you into the whole &s;e|cret. This great officer was deceiv|ed by the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of the com|mi&s;&s;ary, who, in&s;tead of per&s;pectives, had furni&s;hed him with gla&s;&s;es pe|culiar to Japan, that magnified and multiplied objects at the &s;ame time. They are called Pho-beron-tia.&mdash;The large parapets of &s;and were a couple of mole-hills; and the gigan|tic faces of grim a&s;pect, were the po&s;teriors of an old woman &s;acrific|ing <HI>&s;ub dio,</HI> to the powers of dige&s;|tion.&mdash;There was another circum|&s;tance which tended to the mi&s;car|riage of this favourite expedition.&mdash;The principal de&s;ign was again&s;t a trading town, &s;ituated on a navigable river; and at the place where this river di&s;embogued it&s;elf into the &s;ea, there was a Chine&s;e fort called Sa|rouf. The admiral of the Fune &s;ent the &s;econd in command, who&s;e name
<PB N="188" REF="193">
was Sel-uon, to lay this fort in a&s;hes, that the embarkation might pa&s;s without let or mole&s;tation. A Chine&s;e pilot offered to bring his junk within a cable-length of the walls: but he tru&s;ted to the light of his own penetration. He ran his junk aground, and &s;olemnly declar|ed there was not water &s;ufficient to float any ve&s;&s;el of force, within three miles of Sa-rouf. This di&s;covery he had made by &s;ounding, and it proved two very &s;urpri&s;ing paradoxes: fir&s;t, that the Chine&s;e junks drew little or no water, otherwi&s;e they could not have arrived at the town where they were laid up; &s;econdly, that the fort Sa-rouf was rai&s;ed in a &s;pot where it neither could offend, nor be offend|ed. But the Sey-&s;eo-gun Sel-uon was a mighty man for paradoxes. His &s;uperior in command, was a plain man, who did not under&s;tand the&s;e niceties: he therefore grum|bled,
<PB N="189" REF="194">
and began to be trouble&s;ome; upon which, a council of war was held; and he being over-ruled by a majority of voices, the whole em|barkation returned to Niphon <HI>re in|fecta.</HI> You have been told how the bea&s;t called Legion brayed, and bel|lowed, and kicked, when the fate of Byn-goh's expedition was known; it was di&s;po&s;ed to be very unruly at the return of this armament: but Taycho lulled it with a double do&s;e of his Mandragora. It growled at the giants, the &s;and-hills, and the pa|radoxes of Sel-uon: then brayed aloud <HI>Taycho for ever!</HI> rolled it&s;elf up like a lubberly hydra, yawned, and fell fa&s;t a&s;leep.&mdash;The other ar|mament equipped for the operations in Fat&s;i&s;io, did not arrive at the place of de&s;tination till the opportunity for action was lo&s;t. The object was the reduction of a town and i&s;land be|longing to the Chine&s;e: but before
<PB N="190" REF="195">
the Fune with the troops arrived from Niphon, the enemy having re|ceived intimation of their de&s;ign, had reinforced the garri&s;on and harbour with a greater number of forces and Fune than the Japone&s;e commander could bring again&s;t them. He, there|fore, wi&s;ely declined an enterprize which mu&s;t have ended in his own di&s;grace and de&s;truction. The Chi|ne&s;e were &s;ucce&s;sful in other parts of Fat&s;i&s;io. They demoli&s;hed &s;ome forts, they defeated &s;ome parties, and ma&s;&s;acred &s;ome people, belong|ing to the colonies of Japan. Per|haps the tidings of the&s;e di&s;a&s;ters would have rou&s;ed the people of Ni|phon from the lethargy of intoxica|tion in which they were over|whelmed, had not their delirium been keept up by &s;ome fa&s;cinating amulets from Tartary: the&s;e were no other than the bubbles which Brut-an-tiffi &s;welled into mighty
<PB N="191" REF="196">
victories over the Chine&s;e and O&s;trog; though, in fact, he had been &s;evere|ly cudgelled, and more than once in very great danger of crucifixion. Tay|cho pre&s;ented the mon&s;ter with a bowl of blood, which he told it this invinci|ble ally had drawn from its enemies the Chine&s;e, and, at the &s;ame time, blowed the gay bubbles athwart its numerous eyes. The hydra lapped the gore with &s;igns of infinite re|li&s;h; groaned and grunted to &s;ee the bubbles dance; exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"O rare Taycho!"</Q> and relap&s;ed into the arms of &s;lumber. Thus pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t campaign of Taycho's admini&s;|tration.</P>
<P>By this time Fika-kaka was fully convinced that the orator actually dealt with the devil, and had even &s;old him his &s;oul for this power of working miracles on the under&s;tand|ing of the populace. He began to be invaded with fears, that the &s;ame
<PB N="192" REF="197">
con&s;ideration would be demanded of him for the ea&s;e and plea&s;ure he now enjoyed in partner&s;hip with that ma|gician. He no longer heard him|&s;elf &s;coffed, ridiculed, and reviled in the a&s;&s;emblies of the people. He no longer &s;aw his mea&s;ures thwarted, nor his per&s;on treated with di&s;dain. He no longer racked his brains for pre|tences to extort money; nor trem|bled with terror when he u&s;ed the&s;e pretences to the public. The mouth of the oppo&s;ition was now glewed to his own po&s;teriors. Many a time and often, when he heard orator Tycho declaiming again&s;t him from his ro&s;trum, he cur&s;ed him in his heart, and was known to ejaculate <Q REND="inline">"Ki&s;s my a&mdash;&s;e, Taycho;"</Q> but lit|tle did he think the orator would one day &s;toop to this compliance. He now &s;aw that in&s;olent foul|mouthed demagogue mini&s;tring with the utmo&s;t &s;ervility to his plea&s;ure
<PB N="193" REF="198">
and ambition. He filled his bags with the trea&s;ures of Japan, as if by inchantment; &s;o that he could now gratify his own profu&s;e temper with|out &s;tint or controul. He took up|on him&s;elf the whole charge of the admini&s;tration; and left Fika-kaka to the full enjoyment of his own &s;en&s;uality, thus dive&s;ted of all its thorns. It was the contemplation of the&s;e circum&s;tances, which in|&s;pired the Cuboy with a belief that the devil was concerned in produc|ing this a&s;toni&s;hing calm of felicity; and that his infernal highne&s;s would require of him &s;ome extraordinary &s;acrifice for the extraordinary favours he be&s;towed. He could not help &s;u&s;pecting the &s;incerity of Taycho's attachment, becau&s;e it &s;eemed alto|gether unnatural; and if his &s;oul was to be the &s;acrifice, he wi&s;hed to treat with Satan as a principal. Full of this idea, he had recour&s;e to his

Bonzes as the mo&s;t likely per&s;ons to procure him &s;uch an interview with the prince of darkne&s;s, as &s;hould not be attended with immediate dan|ger to his corporeal parts: but, up|on enquiry, he found there was not one conjurer among them all. Some of them made a merit of their igno|rance; pretending they could not in con&s;cience give application to an art which mu&s;t have led them into communication with demons: others in&s;i&s;ted there was no &s;uch thing as the devil; and this opinion &s;eemed to be much reli&s;hed by the Cu|boy: the re&s;t frankly owned they knew nothing at all of the matter. For my part, Peacock, I not only know there is a devil, but I likewi&s;e know that he has marked out nine|teen twentieths of the people of this metropolis for his prey.&mdash;How now!

By the bye, Peacock, you mu&s;t take notice, that the figure of St. George encountering the dragon, which is the &s;ymbol of the order of the Garter, and at this day di&s;tin|gui&s;hes &s;o many inns, taverns, and ale-hou&s;es, in this kingdom, was no other originally than the device of an abraxas or amulet wore by the Ba&s;ilidians, as a charm again&s;t infec|tion: for, by the man on hor&s;eback killing the dragon, was typified the &s;un purifying the air, and di&s;per&s;ing the noxious vapours from the earth. An abraxas marked with this device, is exhibited by Montfaucon out of the Collection of Sig. Capello. This &s;ymbol, improved by the cro&s;s on the top of the &s;pear, was afterwards adopted by the Chri&s;tian cru&s;ards, as a badge of their religious warfare, as well as an amulet to en&s;ure victory; the cro&s;s alluding to Con&s;tantine's

This very George, while he officiated as bi&s;hop of Alexandria, having ordered a temple of the god <HI>Mythras</HI> to be purified, and converted into a Chri&s;tian church, found in the &s;aid temple this em|blem of the &s;un, which the Per&s;ians adored under the name of <HI>Mythras;</HI> and with the addition of the cro&s;s, metamorpho&s;ed it into a &s;ymbol of Chri&s;tian warfare again&s;t idolatry.

empire; to hire tho&s;e pipers who were be&s;t &s;killed in making the mul|titude dance, and find out the able&s;t arti&s;ts to &s;cratch their long ears, and tickle their no&s;es. The&s;e toils were &s;weetened by a variety of enjoyments. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the pomp of often|tation; the vanity of levees, the pride of power, the plea&s;ure of adu|lation, the happine&s;s of being kick|ed by his &s;overeign and ki&s;&s;ed by his Bonzes; and, above all, the delights of the &s;tomach and the clo&s;e-&s;tool, which recurred in perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and which he &s;eemed to enjoy with a par|ticular reli&s;h: for, it mu&s;t be ob&s;er|ved, to the honour of Fika-kaka, that what he eagerly received at one end, he as liberally refunded at the other. But as the faculties of his mind were in&s;ufficient to dige&s;t the great me&s;s of power which had fal|len to his &s;hare, &s;o were the organs of his body unable to concoct the
<PB N="212" REF="217">
enormous ma&s;s of aliments which he &s;o greedily &s;wallowed. He laboured under an indige&s;tion of both; and the vague promi&s;es which went upwards, as well as the murmurs that pa&s;&s;ed the other way, were no other than eruptive crudities ari&s;ing from the defects of his &s;oul and body.</P>
<P>As for Taycho, he confined him&s;elf to the management of the war. He recalled the general in chief from Fat&s;i&s;io, becau&s;e he had not done that which he could not po&s;&s;ibly do: but, in&s;tead of &s;ending another on who&s;e abilities he could depend, he allowed the direction of the armaments to devolve upon the &s;econd in com|mand, who&s;e character he could not po&s;&s;ibly know; becau&s;e, indeed, he was too ob&s;cure to have any charac|ter at all. The fruits of his &s;agacity &s;oon appeared. The new general Abra-moria, having reconnoitred a po&s;t of the enemy, which was found
<PB N="213" REF="218">
too &s;trong to be forced, attacked it without he&s;itation, and his troops were repul&s;ed and routed with con|&s;iderable &s;laughter. It was lucky for Taycho that the tidings of this di&s;a&s;ter were qualified by the news of two other advantages which the arms of Japan had gained.&mdash;A &s;epa|rate corps of troops, under Yaf-frai and Ya-loff, reduced a &s;trong Chine&s;e fortre&s;s in the neighbourhood of Fat&s;i&s;io; and a body of Japone&s;e, headed by a factor called Ka-liff, obtained a con&s;iderable victory at Fla-&s;ao, in the farther extremity of Tartary, where a trading company of Meaco po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a commercial &s;ettlement. The Hydra of Meaco began to &s;hake its numerous heads and growl, when it heard of Abra|moria's defeat. At that in&s;tant, one of its leaders exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Ble&s;s thy long ears! It was not Taycho that recommended Abra-moria to this
<PB N="214" REF="219">
command. He was appointed by the Fatz-man."</Q> This was true. It was likewi&s;e true, that Taycho had allowed him quietly to &s;ucceed to the command, without knowing any thing of his abilities;&mdash;it was equally true, that Taycho was an ut|ter &s;tranger to Yaf-frai and Ya-loff, who took the fortre&s;s, as well as to the factor Ka-liff, who obtained the victory at the farther end of Tar|tary.&mdash;Neverthele&s;s, the bea&s;t cried aloud, "Hang Abra-moria! and a fig for the Fatz-man. But let the prai&s;e of Taycho be magnified! It was Taycho that &s;ubdued the for|tre&s;s in the I&s;le Ka-frit-o. It was Taycho that defeated the enemy at Fla-&s;ao.&mdash;Yaf-frai has &s;lain his thou|&s;ands;&mdash;Ya-loff has &s;lain his five thou&s;ands;&mdash;but Taycho had &s;lain his ten thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>Taycho had credit not only for the &s;ucce&s;s of the Japone&s;e arms, but like|wi&s;e
<PB N="215" REF="220">
for the victories of Brut-an-tiffi, who had lately been much beholden to fortune. I have already ob&s;erved what a noi&s;e that Tartar made when the Fatz-man of Japan found him&s;elf obliged to capitulate with the Chi|ne&s;e general. In con&s;equence of that event, the war was already at an end with re&s;pect to the Japone&s;e, on the continent of Tartary. The emperor of China took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the farm of Ye&s;&s;o; the pea&s;ants quietly &s;ubmit|ted to their new ma&s;ters; and tho&s;e very free-booting Tartar chiefs, who had &s;old their &s;ubjects as &s;oldiers to &s;erve under the Fatz-man, had al|ready agreed to &s;end the very &s;ame mercenaries into the army of China. It was at this juncture that Brut-an-tiffi exalted his throat. In the pre|ceding campaign he had fought with various &s;ucce&s;s. One of his gene|rals had given battle to the Mant|choux Tartars, and each &s;ide claimed
<PB N="216" REF="221">
the victory Another of his leaders had been defeated and taken by the O&s;trog. The Chine&s;e had already advanced to the frontiers of Brut-an|tiffi's dominions. In this dilemma he exerted him&s;elf with equal acti|vity and addre&s;s: he repul&s;ed the Chine&s;e army with con&s;iderable lo&s;s; and in the &s;pace of one month after this action, gained a victory over the general of the O&s;trog. The&s;e ad|vantages rendered him in&s;ufferably arrogant. He exclaimed again&s;t the Fatz-man; he threatened the Dairo; and, as I have taken notice above, a new army was rai&s;ed at the expence of Japan, to defend him from all future inva&s;ions of the Chine&s;e. Already the Tartar general Bron-xi-tic, who was ve&s;ted at his de&s;ire with the command of the mercenary army of Japan, had given a &s;evere check to a &s;trong body of the Chine&s;e, and even threatened to carry the war into the empire of
<PB N="217" REF="222">
China; but his progre&s;s was &s;oon &s;topt, and he was forced to retreat in his turn towards the farm of Ye&s;|&s;o.&mdash;But from nothing did orator Taycho reap a fuller harve&s;t of prai&s;e, than from the conque&s;t of Tzin-khall, a &s;ettlement of the Chi|ne&s;e on the coa&s;t of Terra Au&s;tralis; which conque&s;t was planned by a Banyan merchant of Meaco, who had traded on that coa&s;t, and was particularly known to the king of the country. This royal &s;avage was unea&s;y at the neighbourhood of the Chine&s;e, and conjured the merchant, who&s;e name was Thum-Khumm-qua, to u&s;e his influence at the court of Meaco, that an armament &s;hould be equipped again&s;t the &s;ettlement of Tzin-khall, he him&s;elf &s;olemnly pro|mi&s;ing to co-operate in the reduction of it with all his forces.&mdash;Thum-Khumm-qua, who&s;e zeal for the good of his country got the better of all his
<PB N="218" REF="223">
prudential maxims, did not fail to re|pre&s;ent this object in the mo&s;t inte|re&s;ting points of view. He demon|&s;trated to Taycho the importance of the &s;ettlement; that it abounded with &s;laves, ivory, gold, and a pre|cious gum which was not to be found in any other part of the world; a gum in great reque&s;t all over A&s;ia, and particularly among the Japo|ne&s;e, who were obliged to purcha&s;e it in time of war at &s;econd-hand from their enemies the Chine&s;e, at an exorbitant price. He demon&s;trated that the lo&s;s of this &s;ettlement would be a terrible wound to the emperor of China; and proved that the con|que&s;t of it could be atchieved at a very trifling expence. He did more. Tho' by the maxims of his &s;ect he was re&s;trained from engaging in any military enterprize, he offered to conduct the armament in per&s;on, in order the more effectually to keep
<PB N="219" REF="224">
the king of the country &s;teady to his engagements. Though the &s;cheme was in it&s;elf plau&s;ible and practi|cable, Mr. orator Taycho &s;huffled and equivocated until the &s;ea&s;on for action was pa&s;t. But Thum-Khumm-qua was indefatigable. He exhorted, he pre&s;&s;ed, he remon|&s;trated, he complained; and be&s;ieged the orator's hou&s;e in &s;uch a man|ner, that Taycho at length, in or|der to be rid of his importunity, granted his reque&s;t. A &s;mall arma|ment was fitted out; the Banyan em|barked in it, leaving his own private affairs in confu&s;ion; and the &s;ettle|ment was reduced according to his prediction. When the news of this conque&s;t arrived at Meaco, the multi|farious bea&s;t brayed hoar&s;e applau&s;e, and the mini&s;ter Taycho was magni|fied exceedingly. As for Thum-Khumm-qua, who&s;e private fortune was con&s;umed in the expedition, all
<PB N="220" REF="225">
the recompence he received, was the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having &s;erved his country. In vain he reminded Tay|cho of his promi&s;es; in vain he re|cited the mini&s;ter's own letters, in which he had given his word that the Banyan &s;hould be liberally re|warded, according to the importance of his &s;ervices: Taycho was both deaf and blind to all his remon&s;trances and repre&s;entations; and, at la&s;t, fairly flung the door in his face.</P>
<P>Such was the candour and the gratitude of the incomparable Tay|cho.&mdash;The poor projector Thum-Khumm-qua found him&s;elf in a pi|teous ca&s;e, while the whole nation re&s;ounded with joy for the conque&s;t which his &s;agacity had planned, and his zeal carried into execution. He was not only abandoned by the mini&s;ter Taycho; but al&s;o renounced by the whole &s;ect of the Banyans, who looked upon him as a wicked apo&s;|tate,
<PB N="221" REF="226">
becau&s;e he had been concerned with tho&s;e who fought with the arm of fle&s;h. It was lucky for him that he afterwards found favour with a &s;ub|&s;equent mini&s;ter, who had not adopt|ed all the maxims of his predece&s;&s;or Taycho.&mdash;The only mea&s;ures which this egregious demagogue could hi|therto properly call his own, were the&s;e: His &s;ub&s;idiary treaty with Brut-an-tiffi; his rai&s;ing an im|men&s;e army of mercenaries to act in Tartary for the benefit of that prince; his exacting an incredible &s;um of money from the people of Japan; and finally, two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive armaments which he had &s;ent to annoy the &s;ea-coa&s;t of China. I have already given an account of the fir&s;t, the intent of which was fru&s;|trated by a mi&s;take in the per&s;pec|tives. The other was more fortunate in the beginning. Taycho had by the force of his genius, di&s;covered that

nothing &s;o effectually de&s;troyed the oiled paper which the Chine&s;e u&s;e in their windows in&s;tead of gla&s;s, as the gold coin called Oban, when di&s;charged from a military engine at a proper di&s;tance. He found that gold was more compact, more heavy, more malleable, and more manageable than any other metal or &s;ub&s;tance that he knew: he therefore provid|ed a great quantity of obans, and a good body of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">lingers; and the&s;e be|ing conveyed to the coa&s;t of China, in a &s;quadron of Fune, as none of the Chine&s;e appeared to oppo&s;e the&s;e ho&s;tilities, a &s;elect number of the troops were employed to make ducks and drakes with the obans, on the &s;up|po&s;ition that this diver&s;ion would al|lure the enemy to the &s;ea-&s;ide, where they might be knocked on the head without further trouble: but the care of their own &s;afety got the better of their curio&s;ity on this occa&s;ion; and

fifty thou&s;and obans were expended in this manner, without bringing one Chine&s;e from his lurking-hole. Con&s;iderable damage was done to the windows of the enemy. Then the forces were landed in a village which they found de&s;erted. Here they burned &s;ome fi&s;hing-boats; and from hence they carried off &s;ome military machines, which were brought to Meaco, and conveyed through the &s;treets in proce&s;&s;ion, amid&s;t the acclamations of the Hy|dra, who &s;ung the prai&s;e of Taycho.&mdash;Elevated by this triumph, the mi|ni&s;ter &s;ent forth the &s;ame armament a &s;econd time under a new general of his own choo&s;ing, who&s;e name was Hylib-bib, who had long enter|tained an opinion, that the inhabi|tants of China were not beings of fle&s;h and blood, but mere fanta&s;tic &s;hadows, who could neither offend nor be offended. Full of this opi|nion,

he made a de&s;cent on the coa&s;t of that empire; and to convince his followers that his notion was right, he advanced &s;ome leagues in|to the country, without having taken any precautions to &s;ecure a retreat, leaving the Fune at anchor upon an open beach. Some people alledged, that he depended upon the &s;agacity of an engineer recommended to him by Taycho; which engineer had &s;uch an excellent no&s;e, that he could &s;mell a Chine&s;e at the di&s;tance of ten leagues: but it &s;eems the &s;cent failed him at this juncture. Perhaps the Chine&s;e general had trailed ru&s;ty bacon and other odoriferous &s;ub|&s;tances to confound his &s;en&s;e of &s;melling. Perhaps no dew had fal|len over night, and a &s;trong breeze blew towards the enemy. Certain it is Hylib-bib, in the evening, re|ceived repeated intelligence that he was within half a league of a Chi|ne&s;e

general, at the head of a body of troops greatly &s;uperior in number to the Japone&s;e forces which he him&s;elf commanded. He &s;till be|lieved it was all illu&s;ion; and when he heard their drums beat, declared it was no more than a ridiculous inchantment. He thought proper, however, to retreat towards the &s;ea|&s;ide; but this he did with great de|liberation, after having given the ene|my fair notice by beat of drum. His motions were &s;o &s;low, that he took &s;even hours to march three miles. When he reached the &s;hore where the Fune were at anchor, he &s;aw the whole body of the Chine&s;e drawn up on a ri&s;ing ground ready to be|gin the attack. He ordered his rear|guard to face about on the &s;uppo|&s;ition that the phantoms would di&s;|appear as &s;oon as they &s;hewed their faces; but finding him&s;elf mi&s;taken, and perceiving &s;ome of his own peo|ple

to drop, in con&s;equence of mi&s;|&s;iles that came from the enemy, he very calmly embarked with his van, leaving his rear to amu&s;e the Chi|ne&s;e, by whom they were, in le&s;s than five minutes, either ma&s;&s;acred or taken. From this &s;mall di&s;grace the general deduced two important corollaries; fir&s;t, that the Chine&s;e were actually material beings capa|ble of impul&s;ion; and &s;econdly, that his engineer's no&s;e was not altoge|ther infallible. The people of Meaco did not &s;eem to reli&s;h the experi|ments by which the&s;e ideas were a&s;|certained. The mon&s;ter was heard to grunt in different &s;treets of the me|tropolis; and the&s;e notes of di&s;con|tent produced the u&s;ual effect in the bowels of Fika-kaka: but orator Taycho had his flowers of rhetoric and his bowl of mandragora in rea|dine&s;s. He a&s;&s;ured them that Hy|lib-bib &s;hould be employed for the

Then he tendered his do&s;e, which the Hydra &s;wallowed with &s;igns of plea&s;ure; and la&s;tly, he mounted upon its back, and rode in triumph under the windows of the a&s;toni&s;hed Cuboy, who, while he &s;hifted his trow&s;ers, exclaimed in a rapture of joy, <Q REND="inline">"All hail, Tay|cho, thou prince of mon&s;ter-taming men! the Dairo &s;hall kick thy po&s;|teriors, and I will ki&s;s them in to|ken of approbation and applau&s;e."</Q></P>
