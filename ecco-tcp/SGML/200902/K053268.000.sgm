<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IN di&s;po&s;ing the order of the following work, we have not thought it nece&s;&s;ary to confine our&s;elves &s;trictly within the rules pre&s;cribed by &s;y&s;tematic writers on this part of Natural Hi&s;tory; as it was not &s;o much the object of our plan, to lay down a methodical arrangement of the various tribes of four-footed animals, as to give a clear and conci&s;e account of the nature, habits, and di&s;po&s;ition of each, accompanied with more accurate repre&s;entations than have hitherto appeared in any work of this kind. Our di&s;regard of &s;y&s;tem, however, has not pre|vented us from attending to the great divi&s;ions of Quadrupeds, &s;o obviou&s;ly marked out by the hand of Nature, and &s;o clearly di&s;tingui&s;hed, that the mo&s;t carele&s;s ob&s;erver cannot avoid being forcibly &s;truck with an agreement of parts in the outward ap|pearance of the different individuals of which each con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>The intermediate &s;tations, however, have not been always &s;o clearly defined; the&s;e are frequently occupied by characters &s;o dubious, that naturali&s;ts have not always agreed in a&s;cribing to each its proper place: Of this kind are the Elephant, the Hip|popotamus, the Rhinoceros, the Cameleopard, the Badger, the Beaver, the Hedge-hog, the Sloth, the Jerboa, &amp;c. which bear in them&s;elves characteri&s;tics &s;o peculiar, that they might &s;eem to con&s;titute di&s;tinct genera, and &s;o con&s;picuous, that they cannot ea&s;ily be overlooked nor forgotten in the general group.</P>
<P>We have endeavoured to lay before our readers a particular account of the animals with which our own country is abundantly &s;tored, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e which &s;o materially contribute to the &s;trength, the wealth, and the happine&s;s of this kingdom; of the&s;e the Hor&s;e, the Cow, and the Sheep claim the fir&s;t place; and in treating of the&s;e, we have noticed the improvements which an enlarged &s;y&s;tem of agriculture, &s;upported by a noble &s;pirit of generous emulation, has introduced into all parts of the country.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be thought nece&s;&s;ary to offer &s;ome apology for the evident want of proportion ob&s;ervable in the &s;izes of the dif|ferent animals; a defect to which every work of this kind mu&s;t, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be liable. In adverting to this, we found, that at whatever point, between the Elep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and the Mou&s;e, the &s;cale were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, a great and unavoidable deficiency would be the con&s;equence; we were therefore obliged to relinqui&s;h a plan, which, &s;o far from being practicable, would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the means of throwing the whole into irregularity and confu&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>THE HORSE.</HEAD>
<P>THE various excellencies of this noble animal, the grandeur of his &s;tature, the elegance and propor|tion of his parts, the beautiful &s;moothne&s;s of his &s;kin, the variety and gracefulne&s;s of his motions, and above all, his u&s;efulne&s;s, entitle him to a precedence in the hi&s;tory of the brute creation.</P>
<P>There are few parts of the known world where the Hor&s;e is not produced; but if we would &s;ee him in the enjoyment of his native freedom, (un&s;ubdued by the re|&s;traints man has impo&s;ed upon him) we mu&s;t look for him in the wild and exten&s;ive plains of Africa and Arabia, where he ranges without controul, in a &s;tate of entire in|dependency. In tho&s;e immen&s;e tracts the wild Hor&s;es
<PB N="2" REF="9">
may be &s;een feeding together, in droves of four or five hundred; one of them always acting as centinel, to give notice of approaching danger: This he does by a kind of &s;norting noi&s;e, upon which they all fly off with a&s;toni&s;h|ing rapidity. The wild Hor&s;es of Arabia are e&s;teemed the mo&s;t beautiful in the world: They are of a brown co|lour, their mane and tail of black tufted hair, very &s;hort; they are &s;maller than the tame ones, are very active, and of great &s;wiftne&s;s. The mo&s;t u&s;ual method of taking them is with traps concealed in the &s;and, by which they are entangled and caught.&mdash;It is probable there were once wild Hor&s;es in Europe, which have long &s;ince been brought under &s;ubjection. Tho&s;e found in America were originally of the Spani&s;h breed, &s;ent thither upon its fir&s;t di&s;covery, which have &s;ince become wild, and &s;pread them&s;elves over various parts of that va&s;t continent. They are generally &s;mall, not exceeding fourteen hands high; with thick heads and clum&s;y joints: Their ears and necks are longer than tho&s;e of the Engli&s;h Hor&s;es. They are ea&s;ily tamed; and if by accident they are &s;et at liberty, they &s;eldom become wild again; but know their ma&s;ter, and may be ea&s;ily caught by him.</P>
<P>The Hor&s;e, in his dome&s;tic &s;tate, is generous, docile, &s;pirited, and yet obedient; adapted to the various pur|po&s;es of plea&s;ure and convenience, he is equally &s;ervicea|ble in the draught, the field, or the race.</P>
<P>There is &s;carcely an Arabian, how poor &s;oever in other re&s;pects, but is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his Hor&s;e, which he con&s;iders as an invaluable trea&s;ure. Having no other hou&s;e but a tent to dwell in, the Arabian and his Hor&s;e live upon the mo&s;t equal terms: His wife and family, his mare and her foal, are often &s;een lying indi&s;criminately together; whil&s;t
<PB N="3" REF="10">
the little children frequently climb without fear upon the body of the inoffen&s;ive animal, which permits them to play with and care&s;s it without injury. The Arabs never beat their Hor&s;es; they &s;peak to, and &s;eem to hold friend|ly intercour&s;e with them; they never whip them, and &s;eldom, but in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity, make u&s;e of the &s;pur. Their agility in leaping is very great; and if the rider happen to fall, they are &s;o traceable as to &s;tand &s;till in the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t rapid career. The Arabian Hor&s;es are of a middle &s;ize in general, le&s;s than tho&s;e of this country, ea&s;y and graceful in their motions, and rather inclined to leanne&s;s.&mdash;It is worthy of remark, that there, in&s;tead of cro&s;&s;ing the breed, the Arabs take every precaution to keep it pure and unmixed: They pre&s;erve with the great|e&s;t care, and for an amazing length of time, the races of their hor&s;es&mdash;Tho&s;e of the fir&s;t kind are called Nobles, being "of a pure and ancient race, purer than milk." They have likewi&s;e two other kinds, which have been de|graded by common alliances, and &s;ell at inferior prices.</P>
<P>From Arabia the race of Hor&s;es has probably extended into Barbary and other parts of Africa, tho&s;e being con&s;i|dered as next to the Arabian Hor&s;es in &s;wiftne&s;s and beau|ty, though they are &s;till &s;maller. The Spani&s;h Genette is al&s;o held in great e&s;timation; like the former they are &s;mall, but beautiful, and extremely &s;wift. The Hor&s;es of India and many parts of China are extremely &s;mall and vicious: One of the&s;e was &s;ome years ago brought into this country as a pre&s;ent to the queen, which was very little larger than &s;ome ma&s;tiffs, mea&s;uring only nine hands in height.</P>
<P>In Great-Britain the breed of Hor&s;es &s;eems to be as mixed as that of its inhabitants. By great attention to the

improvement of this noble animal, by a judicious mixture of &s;everal kinds, and by &s;uperior &s;kill in management, the Engli&s;h

<P>DORIMANT, a famous Hor&s;e belonging to Lord O&s;&s;ory, won prizes to the amazing amount of 13,363l.</P>
<P>LITTLE DRIVER (by the famous Childers) won 1,450l. in 50l. plates; and beat, at different times, forty-four running Hor&s;es, which had collectively won two hundred and three prizes.</P>
<P>ECLIPSE was allowed to be the fleete&s;t Hor&s;e that ever ran in England &s;ince the time of Childers. After winning king's plates and other prizes to a great amount, he now covers, by &s;ub&s;cription, forty mares, at thirty guineas each; be&s;ides tho&s;e of his owner.</P>
<P>GIMCRACK won prizes to the amount of above 5,000l. He like|wi&s;e ran a match in France, of twenty-two miles and an half within the hour, for a con&s;iderable &s;um.</P>
<P>HIGHFLYER was accounted the be&s;t Hor&s;e of his time in England. The &s;ums he won and received amounted to near 9,000l. though he never &s;tarted after five years old. He was never beat, nor ever paid a forfeit.</P>
<P>MATCHEM, a Hor&s;e belonging to the late W. Fenwick, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> be|&s;ides being a capital racer, was particularly remarkable as a &s;tallion; and may be truly &s;aid to have earned more money than any other Hor&s;e in the world. He was engaged, for the latter nine years of his life, to cover twenty-five mares, at fifty guineas a mare; and was uncommonly &s;ucce&s;sful in the celebrity of his progeny, having been fire to many of our mo&s;t famous running Hor&s;es. He was re|markable for being the quiete&s;t &s;tallion that ever was known; to which, perhaps, may be attributed his great age, being in the thir|ty-third year of his age when he died.</P>
<P>PYRRHUS won upwards of 12,500l.</P>

<P>No other country has produced a breed of Hor&s;es equal in &s;ize and &s;trength to the larger kind of our draught Hor&s;es. The cavalry of England is in general formed of this cla&s;s of Hor&s;es; but their inutility being experienced in &s;ome &s;ituations, others of a lighter and more active kind have been &s;ub&s;tituted in a few regiments. The fens of Lincoln&s;hire generally produce a larger breed than any other part of the kingdom. In London there have been in&s;tances where a &s;ingle Hor&s;e of that kind has drawn, for a &s;mall &s;pace, the enormous weight of three tons, half of which is known to be their ordinary draught.</P>

&s;ometimes at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. The following in|&s;tance will &s;hew with what ob&s;tinate per&s;everance they have been known to ob&s;erve the line of their order:&mdash; Some years ago one of the&s;e Hor&s;es, which had been long accu&s;tomed to follow his leader, by accident or fa|tigue was thrown into an inferior rank; the poor ani|mal, as if &s;en&s;ible of his di&s;grace, by the mo&s;t &s;trenuous exertions at length recovered his u&s;ual &s;tation, which he maintained during the remainder of the journey; but, on his arrival in the inn-yard, he dropped down dead upon the &s;pot, his life falling a &s;acrifice to his ambition&mdash;A &s;pecies of heroi&s;m we mu&s;t admire even in the brute cre|ation.</P>
<P>Although the Hor&s;e is endowed with va&s;t &s;trength and powers, he &s;eldom exerts either to the prejudice of his ma&s;ter: On the contrary, he &s;eems to participate in his plea&s;ure, and &s;hares with him in his labours; generous and per&s;evering, he gives up his whole powers to the &s;er|vice of his ma&s;ter; though bold and intrepid, he repre&s;&s;es the natural vivacity and fire of his temper, and not only yields to the hand, but &s;eems to con&s;ult the inclination of his rider.</P>
<P>But it mu&s;t continue to be matter of regret to every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ling mind, that the&s;e excellent qualities &s;hould be often &s;hamefully abu&s;ed in the mo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary exertions; and the hone&s;t labours of this noble animal thrown away in the ungrateful ta&s;k of accompli&s;hing the purposes of unfeeling folly, or lavi&s;hed in gratifying the expectations of an in|temperate moment.</P>

</FIGURE> THE MULE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS u&s;eful and hardy animal is the offspring of the Hor&s;e and the A&s;s, and being barren, furni&s;hes us with an indi&s;putable proof that the two &s;pecies are per|fectly di&s;tinct. Nature has providently &s;topped the fur|ther propagation of the&s;e heterogeneous productions, to pre&s;erve, uncontaminated, the form of each animal; with|out which regulation the races would, in a &s;hort time, be mixed with each other, and every creature lo&s;ing its ori|ginal perfection, would rapidly degenerate.</P>
<P>The common Mule is very healthy, and will live above thirty years: It is found very &s;erviceable in carrying bur|thens, particularly in mountainous and &s;tony places where Hor&s;es are not &s;o &s;ure-footed. The &s;ize and &s;trength of our breed has lately been much improved by the importa|tion of Spani&s;h Male-A&s;&s;es; and it were much to be wi&s;h|ed that the u&s;eful qualities of this animal were more at|tended to: For by proper care in its breaking, its natural ob&s;tinacy would be in a great mea&s;ure corrected; and it
<PB N="11" REF="18">
might be formed with &s;ucce&s;s, for the &s;addle, the draught, or the burthen.</P>
<P>People of the fir&s;t quality in Spain are drawn by Mules, where fifty or &s;ixty guineas is no uncommon price for one of them; nor is it &s;urprizing, when we con&s;ider how far they excel the Hor&s;e in travelling in a mountainous coun|try, the Mule being able to tread &s;ecurely where the for|mer can hardly &s;tand. Their manner of going down the precipices of the Alps, the Andes, &amp;c. is very extraordi|nary; and with it we will conclude their hi&s;tory. In the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, on one &s;ide, are &s;teep eminences, and on the other, frightful aby&s;&s;es; and, as they generally follow the direction of the mountain, the road, in&s;tead of lying in a level, forms at every little di&s;tance &s;teep declivities, of &s;e|veral hundred yards downward. The&s;e can only be de|&s;cended by Mules; and the animal it&s;elf &s;eems &s;en&s;ible of the danger, and the caution that is to be u&s;ed in &s;uch de|&s;cents. When they come to the edge of one of the&s;e de|&s;cents, they &s;top without being checked by the rider; and if he inadvertently attempt to &s;pur them on, they continue immoveable. They &s;eem all this time ruminating on the danger that lies before them, and preparing them&s;elves for the encounter. They not only attentively view the road, but tremble and &s;nort at the danger. Having pre|pared for the de&s;cent, they place their fore feet in a po&s;|ture, as if they were &s;topping them&s;elves; they then al&s;o put their hinder feet together, but a little forward, as if they were going to lie down. In this attitude, having taken as it were a &s;urvey of the road, they &s;lide down with the &s;wiftne&s;s of a meteor. In the mean time, all the rider has to do is to keep him&s;elf fa&s;t on the &s;addle without checking the rein, for the lea&s;t motion is &s;ufficient to di&s;|order
<PB N="12" REF="19">
the equilibrium of the Mule; in which ca&s;e they both unavoidably peri&s;h. But their addre&s;s in this rapid de&s;cent is truly wonderful; for in their &s;wifte&s;t motion, when they &s;eem to have lo&s;t all government of them&s;elves, they follow exactly the different windings of the road, as if they had previou&s;ly &s;ettled in their minds the route they were to follow, and taken every precaution for their &s;afe|ty. In this journey the natives place them&s;elves along the &s;ides of the mountains, and holding by the roots of the trees, animate the bea&s;ts with &s;houts, and encourage them to per&s;evere. Some Mules, after being long u&s;ed to the&s;e journies, acquire a kind of reputation for their &s;afety and &s;kill; and their value ri&s;es in proportion to their fame.</P>

<P>THE A&s;s, it is probable, was originally a native of Arabia and other parts of the ea&s;t: The de&s;erts of Lybia and Numidia, and many i&s;lands of the Archipelago, contain va&s;t herds of wild A&s;&s;es, which run with &s;uch amazing &s;wiftne&s;s, that even the cour&s;ers of the country can hardly overtake them. They are chiefly caught by the natives on account of their fle&s;h, which is eaten by them, and con&s;idered as a delicious repa&s;t. The fle&s;h of the common or tame A&s;s is however drier, more tough, and di&s;agreeable than that of the Hor&s;e; Galen &s;ays it is even unwhole&s;ome: Its milk, on the contrary, is an ap|proved remedy for certain di&s;orders. The wild A&s;s is not &s;treaked like the Zebra, (with which it has often been confounded) nor is his form &s;o beautiful: His figure re&s;embles that of the common A&s;s, his colour is brighter, and he has a white &s;treak extending from his head to his tail.</P>
<P>The A&s;s, like the Hor&s;e, was originally imported into
<PB N="14" REF="21">
America by the Spaniards, where it has run wild, and multiplied in a great degree. Ulloa informs us, that, in the kingdom of Quito, they hunt them in the following manner:&mdash;A number of per&s;ons on hor&s;eback, attended by Indians on foot, form a large circle in order to drive them into a narrow compa&s;s, where at full &s;peed they throw a noo&s;e over them, and having &s;ecured them with fetters, leave them till the chace is over, which frequently la&s;ts for &s;everal days. They have all the &s;wiftne&s;s of Hor&s;es; and neither declivities nor precipices can retard them in their flight. When attacked, they defend them|&s;elves with their heels and mouths with &s;uch activity, that, without &s;lackening their pace, they often maim their pur&s;uers.</P>
<P>A warm climate is mo&s;t favourable to the growth of this animal: The A&s;s produced in this country, is much inferior in &s;ize and beauty to tho&s;e of Spain and other warm countries: In Guinea they are larger and more beautiful than even their Hor&s;es: In Per&s;ia they have two kinds, the one &s;low and heavy, which is made u&s;e of for carrying burthens; the other, nimble, &s;mooth, and &s;tate|ly, u&s;ed chiefly for the &s;addle. They are managed as Hor&s;es; and, like them, are taught to amble. They ge|nerally &s;lit their no&s;trils to give them more room for breathing. Many of the&s;e are &s;old as high as forty or fifty pounds.</P>
<P>Holing&s;hed informs us, that in the reign of queen Elizabeth there were no A&s;&s;es in this country: How &s;oon after they might be introduced is uncertain. How|ever they are at pre&s;ent naturalized in this kingdom, where their utility becomes daily more univer&s;ally expe|rienced.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="22">The qualities of this animal are &s;o well known as to need no de&s;cription: His gentlene&s;s, patience, and per|&s;everance, are without example: He is temperate with regard to food; and eats contentedly the coar&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t neglected herbage: If he give the preference to any vegetable, it is to the plantain, for which he will neglect every other herb in the pa&s;ture. In his water he is &s;ingu|larly nice, drinking only from the cleare&s;t brooks. He is &s;o much afraid of wetting his feet, that, even when load|en, he will turn a&s;ide to avoid the dirty parts of the road.</P>
<P>He is &s;tronger, in proportion to his &s;ize, than the Hor&s;e; but more &s;luggi&s;h, &s;tubborn, and untractable. He is healthier than the Hor&s;e; and, of all other quadru|peds, is lea&s;t infe&s;ted with lice or other vermin, which is probably owing to the extreme hardne&s;s and dryne&s;s of his &s;kin. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, perhaps, he is le&s;s &s;en&s;itive of the goads of the whip, or the &s;tinging of flies.</P>
<P>He is three or four years in coming to perfection; and lives to the age of twenty, or &s;ometimes twenty-five years. He &s;leeps much le&s;s than the Hor&s;e; and never lies down for that purpo&s;e but when he is much fatigued. The She-A&s;s goes eleven months with young; and &s;el|dom produces more than one at a time.</P>
<P>The &s;ervices of this u&s;eful creature are too often repaid by hard fare and cruel u&s;age; and being generally the property of the poor, it partakes of their wants and their di&s;tre&s;&s;es: Whereas, by due cultivation and care in its education, the A&s;s might be u&s;efully and profitably em|ployed in a variety of dome&s;tic purpo&s;es, and in many ca&s;es &s;upply the place of the Hor&s;e, to which only it is &s;econd, though generally degraded into the mo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s and neglected of dome&s;tic quadrupeds.</P>

<P>WHICH many authors have mi&s;taken for a wild A&s;s, is the mo&s;t beautiful, as well as the wilde&s;t, mo&s;t timid, and untameable animal in nature. Being larger than the A&s;s, it rather re&s;embles the Mule in &s;hape: Its head is large; its ears longer than tho&s;e of the Hor&s;e; its legs beautifully &s;mall, and well placed; and its body well formed, round, and fle&s;hy: But the beauty of its &s;hape is greatly heightened by the glo&s;&s;y &s;moothne&s;s of its &s;kin, and the amazing regularity and elegance of its colours, which in the male are white and brown, and in the fe|male white and black, ranged in alternate &s;tripes over the whole body, in a &s;tile &s;o beautiful and ornamental, that it would at fir&s;t &s;ight &s;eem rather the effect of art than the genuine production of nature: The head is &s;triped with fine bands of black and white, which form a center in the forehead: The neck is adorned with &s;tripes of the &s;ame colour running round it: The body is beautifully varie|gated
<PB N="17" REF="24">
with bands running acro&s;s the back, and ending in points at the belly: Its thighs, its legs, its ears, and even its tail, are all beautifully &s;treaked in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>The Zebra inhabits the &s;outhern parts of Africa, where whole herds are &s;een feeding in tho&s;e exten&s;ive plains that lie towards the Cape of Good Hope. However their watchfulne&s;s is &s;uch, that they will &s;uffer nothing to come near them; and their &s;wiftne&s;s &s;o great, that they ea&s;ily leave their pur&s;uers far behind.</P>
<P>Such is the beauty of this creature, that it &s;eems by na|ture fitted to gratify the pride, and formed for the &s;ervice of man; and it is mo&s;t probable that time and a&s;&s;iduity alone are wanting to bring it under &s;ubjection. As it re|&s;embles the Hor&s;e in regard to its form as well as man|ner of living, there can be little doubt but it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a &s;i|militude of nature, and only requires the efforts of an in|du&s;trious and &s;kilful nation, to be added to the number of our u&s;eful dependants. Neverthele&s;s its liberty has hi|therto remained uncontrouled, and its natural fiercene&s;s has as yet re&s;i&s;ted every attempt to &s;ubdue it: Tho&s;e that have been brought to this country, have di&s;covered a de|gree of viciou&s;ne&s;s that rendered it un&s;afe to approach them too familiarly; but it is by no means to be con|cluded from hence, that they are untameable.</P>
<P>They have continued to be wild, becau&s;e they are na|tives of a country where the wretched inhabitants have no other idea of advantage from the animal creation than as they are good for food, paying more regard to that which affords the mo&s;t delicious repa&s;t, than to delicacy of co|louring, or beauty of conformation.</P>

</FIGURE> THE COMMON BULL AND COW.</HEAD>
<P>OF all animals, except man, the Cow &s;eems mo&s;t exten&s;ively propagated: It is equally capable of enduring the rigours of heat and cold; and is an inhabi|tant of the frozen as well as the mo&s;t &s;corching climates. Other animals pre&s;erve their nature or their form with inflexible per&s;everance; but the&s;e in every re&s;pect &s;uit
<PB N="20" REF="27">
them&s;elves to the wants and conveniences of mankind. In no animal is there to be met with a greater variety of kinds; and in none a more humble and pliant di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>The climate and pa&s;tures of Great-Britain are well a|dapted to the moderate nature of this animal; and we are indebted to the variety and abundance of our whole&s;ome vegetables for the number and excellence of our cattle, which range over our hills, and enliven our plains; a &s;ource of inexhau&s;tible wealth&mdash;the pride and boa&s;t of this happy country.</P>
<P>Being de&s;titute of the upper fore-teeth, the Cow pre|fers the high and rich gra&s;s in pa&s;tures to the &s;hort and more delicate herbage the Hor&s;e generally &s;elects. For this rea&s;on, in our Engli&s;h pa&s;tures, where the gra&s;s is rather high and flouri&s;hing than &s;ucculent and nutritious, the Cow thrives admirably; and there is no part of Eu|rope in which this animal grows larger<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Two Oxen, bred and fed at Howick, in the county of North|umberland, were killed in March, 1787, at the age of &s;even years: They mea&s;ured from the head to the rump nine feet eight inches, the height at the &s;houlder was five feet ten inches, and weighed one hundred and &s;eventy-eight &s;tone five pounds each.</NOTE>, yields more milk, nor fattens &s;ooner.</P>
<P>It has often been remarked, that the Hor&s;e and Sheep impoveri&s;h the &s;oil on which they graze; whil&s;t the pa&s;|ture where the Cow is fed, acquires a finer &s;urface, and every year becomes more level and beautiful: For the Hor&s;e &s;elects the gra&s;s that is mo&s;t delicate and tender, and being furni&s;hed with fore-teeth on each jaw, nips it clo&s;e, and frequently pulls it up by the roots, thereby preventing its future growth and propagation: The Sheep al&s;o, though formed like the Cow with re&s;pect to its teeth, only bites the mo&s;t &s;ucculent parts of the herbage.
<PB N="21" REF="28">
The&s;e animals therefore cut the fine gra&s;s too clo&s;ely, and &s;uffer the high weeds and ranker gra&s;s to vegetate undi&s;|turbed, and overrun the pa&s;tures.</P>
<P>The age of the Cow is known by its horns: At the age of four years a ring is formed at their roots, and every &s;ucceeding year another ring is added. Thus by allow|ing three years before their appearance, and then reckon|ing the number of rings, the creature's age may be ex|actly known.</P>
<P>The quantity of milk given by the Cow is very diffe|rent: Some will yield only about &s;ix quarts in one day, while others give from ten to fifteen, and &s;ometimes even twenty. The richne&s;s of the pa&s;ture contributes not a little to its encrea&s;e. There have been in&s;tances of Cows giving upwards of thirty quarts of milk in one day. In &s;uch ca&s;es there is a nece&s;&s;ity for milking them thrice. From the milk of &s;ome cows twelve or fourteen pounds of butter are made in a week.</P>
<P>It has been advanced by &s;ome naturali&s;ts as a general principle, that neither animals, nor parts of animals, ap|pear to be primarily intended for the u&s;e of man; but are only capable of a &s;econdary application to his purpo&s;es: Yet it mu&s;t be allowed, that, in many in&s;tances, what they term the &s;econdary u&s;e is &s;o manife&s;t and important, that it cannot, with propriety, be &s;uppo&s;ed to be excluded from the original de&s;igns of the all-wi&s;e Creator: And it mu&s;t be allowed, that the Cow, in its faculty of giving in &s;uch abundance, and with &s;o much ea&s;e, its milk, which forms &s;o rich and nutritive an aliment for the hu|man &s;pecies, is a &s;triking example of this &s;ubordination to the intere&s;ts of mankind: For this animal differs, in &s;ome parts of its organization from mo&s;t others, having
<PB N="22" REF="29">
a larger and more capacious udder, and longer and thicker teats, than the large&s;t animal we know. It has likewi&s;e four teats, while all other animals of the &s;ame nature have but two. It al&s;o yields the milk freely to the hand, while mo&s;t animals, at lea&s;t tho&s;e that do not ruminate in the &s;ame manner, refu&s;e it, except their own young, or &s;ome adopted animal, be allowed to partake.</P>
<P>The Cow, having four teats, is a &s;triking peculiarity: The number in all other animals bearing &s;ome proportion to the number of young ones they bring forth at a time; as in the Bitch, the Cat, the Sow, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Cow will yield her milk as freely, and will conti|nue to give it as long, without the aid of the calf, as if it were permitted to &s;uck her con&s;tantly. This is not the ca&s;e with the A&s;s; which, it is well known, will &s;oon grow dry, if her foal be not permitted to &s;uck part of her milk every day.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it appears, that the property of yield|ing milk, without the young one, is confined to tho&s;e kinds of ruminating horned animals which have cloven hoofs, four &s;tomachs, long inte&s;tines, are furni&s;hed with &s;uet, and have no fore-teeth in the upper jaw; that Cows, Sheep, Goats, and Deer, are of this kind, and no other; and that the Cow has this property in a more emi|nent degree than others, owing to the capaciou&s;ne&s;s of her udder, and the &s;ize and form of her teats.</P>
<P>By great indu&s;try and attention to their breed, and by judicious mixtures with tho&s;e of other countries, our horned cattle are univer&s;ally allowed to be the fine&s;t in Europe; although &s;uch as are purely Briti&s;h are inferior in &s;ize to tho&s;e on many parts of the continent. The large &s;pecies now propagated in mo&s;t parts of England,
<PB N="23" REF="30">
are either entirely foreign, or our own greatly improved by a cro&s;s or mixture with the foreign kind. The Hol|&s;tein or Dutch breed has been introduced with great &s;uc|ce&s;s; and from the&s;e the Lincoln&s;hire kind derive their &s;ize.</P>

<P>The Lanca&s;hire breed forms a variety of a &s;maller &s;ize, with wide &s;preading horns, and &s;traight backs; their hair is finely curled; and the elegance and regularity of their &s;hape render this the mo&s;t beautiful race of cattle this kingdom produces. Farther North they are &s;till &s;maller; and in the Highlands of Scotland they are very diminu|tive, being not larger than an A&s;s. Of the&s;e large droves are yearly brought out of that country to fatten in the &s;outhern parts of the kingdom, where they &s;oon greatly improve.</P>
<P>The Cow &s;eems more liable to changes from its pa&s;ture and climate than any other quadruped: In the different parts of this narrow i&s;land we can trace a wonderful va|riety
<PB N="24" REF="31">
of the&s;e animals produced by the richne&s;s or poverty of the &s;oil. In &s;hort, in every part of the world the Cow is found either large or &s;mall, in proportion to the rich|ne&s;s or poverty of its food. Among the Eluth Tartars, where the pa&s;tures are remarkably rich and nouri&s;hing, the Cow grows to &s;uch an amazing &s;ize that a tall man can &s;carcely reach the tip of its &s;houlder. In France, on the contrary, where this animal is &s;tinted in its food, and driven from the bed pa&s;tures, it greatly degenerates.</P>
<P>In Great-Britain, the Ox is the only horned animal that will apply his &s;trength to the &s;ervice of mankind; and in general, is more profitable than the Hor&s;e for the plough or the draught. There is &s;carcely any part of this animal without its u&s;e: The &s;kin is made into various kinds of leather; the hair is mixed with lime for plai&s;tering; the bones are made u&s;e of as a &s;ub&s;titute for ivory, and being calcined, are u&s;ed by the refiner as an ab&s;orbent to carry off the ba&s;er metals in refining &s;ilver, &amp;c.; combs, and many ether articles, are made of the horns; we are &s;up|plied with candles from the tallow; and from the feet is procured an oil of great u&s;e in preparing and &s;oftening leather; be&s;ides the well-known benefits derived from butter, milk, and chee&s;e; its blood, gall, liver, and urine, have their re&s;pective u&s;es in manufactures and medicine.</P>

<P>There was formerly a very &s;ingular &s;pecies of wild cat|tle in this country, which is now nearly extinct. Nume|rous herds of them were kept in &s;everal parks in England and Scotland, but have been de&s;troyed by various means;
<PB N="26" REF="33">
and the only breed now remaining in the kingdom, is in the park at Chillingham-ca&s;tle, in Northumberland.</P>
<P>The principal external appearances which di&s;tingui&s;h this breed of cattle from all others, are the following:&mdash; Their colour is invariably white; muzzles black; the whole of the in&s;ide of the ear, and about one-third of the out&s;ide, from the tip downwards, red<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">About twenty years &s;ince, there were a few with BLACK FAR<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: but the pre&s;ent park-keeper de&s;troyed them;&mdash;&s;ince which period there has not been one with black ears.</NOTE>; horns whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, with black tips, very fine, and bent upwards: Some of the Bulls have a thin upright mane, about an inch and an half or two inches long.</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t appearance of any per&s;on, they &s;et off in full gallop; and, at the di&s;tance of two or three hundred yards, make a wheel round, and come boldly up again, to&s;&s;ing their heads in a menacing manner; on a &s;udden they make a full &s;top at the di&s;tance of forty or fifty yards, looking wildly at the object of their &s;urprize; but upon the lea&s;t motion being made, they all again turn round, and fly off with equal &s;peed, but not to the &s;ame di&s;tance; forming a &s;horter circle, and again returning with a bolder and more threatening a&s;pect than before, they approach much nearer, probably within thirty yards; when they make another &s;tand, and again fly off: This they do &s;ever|al times, &s;hortening their di&s;tance and advancing nearer, till they come within ten yards, when mo&s;t people think it prudent to leave them, not chu&s;ing to provoke them fur|ther; for there is little doubt but in two or three turns they would make an attack.</P>
<P>The made of killing them was perhaps the only modern remains of the grandeur of ancient hunting:&mdash;On notice
<PB N="27" REF="34">
being given, that a wild Bull would be killed on a certain day, the inhabitants of the neighbourhood came mounted, and armed with guns, &amp;c. &s;ometimes to the amount of an hundred hor&s;e, and four or five hundred foot, who &s;tood upon walls, or got into trees, while the hor&s;emen rode off the Bull from the re&s;t of the herd, until he &s;tood at bay; when a mark&s;man di&s;mounted and &s;hot. At &s;ome of the&s;e huntings twenty or thirty &s;hots have been fired before he was &s;ubdued. On &s;uch occa&s;ions the bleeding victim grew de&s;perately furious, from the &s;mart|ing of his wounds, and the &s;houts of &s;avage joy that were echoing from every &s;ide: But from the number of acci|dents that happened, this dangerous mode has been little practi&s;ed of late years, the park-keeper alone generally &s;hooting them with a rifled gun, at one &s;hot.</P>
<P>When the Cows calve, they hide their calves for a week or ten days in &s;ome &s;eque&s;tered &s;ituation, and go and &s;uckle them two or three times a-day. If any per|&s;on come near the calves, they clap their heads clo&s;e to the ground, and lie like a hare in form, to hide them|&s;elves. This is a proof of their native wildne&s;s; and is corroborated by the following circum&s;tance that happened to the writer of this narrative, who found a hidden calf, two days old, very lean, and very weak:&mdash;On &s;troking its head, it got up, pawed two or three times like an old Bull, bellowed very loud, &s;tepped back a few &s;teps, and bolted at his legs with all its force; it then began to paw again, bellowed, &s;tepped back, and bolted as before; but knowing its intention, and &s;tepping a&s;ide, it mi&s;&s;ed him, fell, and was &s;o very weak that it could not ri&s;e, though it made &s;everal efforts: But it had done enough: The whole herd were alarmed, and coming to its re&s;cue,
<PB N="28" REF="35">
obliged him to retire; for the dams will allow no per&s;on to touch their calves, without attacking them with impe|tuous ferocity.</P>
<P>When any one happens to be wounded, or is grown weak and feeble through age or &s;ickne&s;s, the re&s;t of the herd &s;et upon it, and gore it to death.</P>
<P>The weight of the Oxen is generally from forty to fifty &s;tone the four quarters; the Cows about thirty. The beef is finely marbled, and of excellent flavour.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e at Burton-Con&s;table, in the county of York, were all de&s;troyed by a di&s;temper a few years &s;ince. They varied &s;lightly from tho&s;e at Chillingham, having black ears and muzzles, and the tips of their tails of the &s;ame colour; they were al&s;o much larger, many of them weighing &s;ixty &s;tone, probably owing to the richne&s;s of the pa&s;turage in Holderne&s;s, but generally attributed to the difference of kind between tho&s;e with black and with red ears, the former of which they &s;tudiou&s;ly endeavoured to pre&s;erve.&mdash;The breed which was at Drumlanrig, in Scotland, had al&s;o black ears.</P>

<P>differs from the re&s;t of the Ox kind in having a large lump between its &s;houlders almo&s;t as high as that of a ca|mel: He has a long &s;haggy mane, which forms a kind of beard under his chin; his eyes are fierce, his forehead large, and his horns extremely wide. It is dangerous to pur&s;ue him, except in fore&s;ts abounding with trees large enough to conceal the hunters. He is generally taken in pits covered with branches of trees and gra&s;s, on the op|po&s;ite &s;ide of which the hunters tempt the animal to pur|&s;ue them; and the enraged creature running towards them, falls into the trap prepared for it, and is then over|powered and &s;lain.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;on, or the animal with the hump, is found in all the &s;outhern parts of the world, though greatly differ|ing from each other in &s;ize and form; while the Urus, or the one without the hump, chiefly occupies the tempe|rate and cold climates. The former extend throughout the va&s;t continent of India, and from Mount Atlas to

the Cape of Good Hope. In &s;ome parts they are ex|tremely large; while in others they are very &s;mall, &s;uch as the Zebu or Barbary Cow.</P>

<P>They are all equally docile and gentle, when tamed; and are in general covered with fine glo&s;&s;y hair, &s;ofter and more beautiful than that of the common Cow. Their humps are of different &s;izes, in &s;ome weighing from forty to fifty pounds, but in others le&s;s: That part is in ge|neral con&s;idered as a great delicacy; and when dre&s;&s;ed, has much the appearance and ta&s;te of udder.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;ons of Madaga&s;car and Malabar are of the great kind; tho&s;e of Arabia, Petrea, and mo&s;t parts of Africa, are of the Zebu or &s;mall kind.</P>
<P>In America, e&s;pecially towards the North, the Bi&s;on is well known. They herd together in droves of from one to two hundred, on the banks of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi; where the inhabitants hunt them, their fle&s;h being e&s;teemed good eating. They all breed with the tame cow. The
<PB N="32" REF="39">
hump, which is only an accidental characteri&s;tic, gradu|ally declines; and in a few generations, no ve&s;tiges of it remain. Thus we &s;ee, whether it be the wild or the tame Ox, the Bona&s;us or the Urus, the Bi&s;on or the Ze|bu, by whatever name they are di&s;tingui&s;hed, and though variou&s;ly cla&s;&s;ed by naturali&s;ts, in reality they are the &s;ame; and however diver&s;ified in their appearance and properties, are de&s;cendants of one common &s;tock; of which the mo&s;t unequivocal proof is, that they all mix and breed with each other.</P>
<P>The Oxen of India are of different &s;izes, and are made u&s;e of in travelling, as &s;ub&s;titutes for hor&s;es. Their com|mon pace is &s;oft. In&s;tead of a bit, a &s;mall cord is pa&s;&s;ed through the cartilage of the no&s;trils, which is tied to a larger cord, and &s;erves as a bridle. They are &s;addled like Hor&s;es; and when pu&s;hed, move very bri&s;kly: They are likewi&s;e u&s;ed in drawing chariots and carts. For the for|mer purpo&s;e, white Oxen are in great e&s;teem, and much admired: They will perform journies of &s;ixty days, at the rate of from twelve to fifteen leagues a day; and their travelling pace is generally a trot.</P>
<P>In Per&s;ia there are many Oxen entirely white, with &s;mall blunt horns, and humps on their backs. They are very &s;trong, and carry heavy burthens. When about to be loaded, they drop down on their knees like the camel, and ri&s;e when their burthens are properly fa&s;tened.</P>

to form and nature, their habits and propen&s;ities being nearly &s;imilar, are both equally &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to the yoke, and may be employed in the &s;ame dome&s;tic &s;ervices; yet it is certain from experience, that no two animals can in reality be more di&s;tinct;&mdash;the Cow refu&s;es to breed with the Buffalo, while it is known to propagate with the Bi|&s;on, to which it bears, in point of form, a much more di&s;tant &s;imilitude.</P>
<P>The Buffalo is found wild in many parts of Africa and India, but is mo&s;t common in the countries near the Cape of Good Hope; where he is de&s;cribed by Sparrman, as a fierce, cruel, and treacherous animal: He frequently &s;tands behind trees, waiting the coming of &s;ome pa&s;&s;en|ger; when he ru&s;hes out upon him, and, after having thrown him down, tramples him to death with his feet and knees, tearing him with his horns and teeth, and licking him with his rough tongue till the &s;kin is nearly &s;tripped from the body.&mdash;The following accurate de&s;crip|tion we owe to the &s;ame author:&mdash;The length of the Buf|falo, from head to tail, is eight feet; the height five and a half; and the fore-legs two feet and a half long: From the tip of the muzzle to the horns, twenty-two inches: His limbs, in proportion to his &s;ize, are much &s;touter than tho&s;e of the Ox; his fetlocks likewi&s;e hang nearer the ground: The horns are &s;ingular both in their form and po&s;ition; the ba&s;es of them are thirteen inches broad, and only an inch di&s;tant from each other, having a narrow channel or furrow between them; from this furrow the horns a&s;&s;ume a &s;pherical form, extending over a great part of the head; the &s;urface, from the ba&s;e upwards to nearly a third part of them, is very rough, and full of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts, &s;ometimes an inch deep; the di&s;tance between the
<PB N="35" REF="42">
points is often above five feet: The ears are a foot long, &s;omewhat pendent, and in a great mea&s;ure covered and defended by the lower edges of the horns, which bend down on each &s;ide, forming a curve upwards with the points: Their hair is of a dark-brown colour, about an inch long, har&s;h, and upon tho&s;e males that are ad|vanced in years, &s;traggling and thin, e&s;pecially on each &s;ide of the belly, which gives them the appearance of be|ing girt with a belt: They frequently roll them&s;elves in the mire, of which they are very fond: The tail is &s;hort, and tufted at the end: The eyes are large, and &s;omewhat &s;unk within their prominent orbits, which are almo&s;t co|vered with the ba&s;es of the horns overhanging its dang|ling ears; this, with a peculiar inclination of the head to one &s;ide, which is its u&s;ual manner, produces an a&s;pect at once fierce, cunning, and tremendous: The fle&s;h of the Buffalo is coar&s;e, rather lean, but full of juice of a high, but not unplea&s;ant flavour: The hide is thick and tough, and of great u&s;e in making thongs and harne&s;s; it is &s;o hard, as not to be penetrated by a common mu&s;|ket-ball; tho&s;e made u&s;e of for &s;hooting the Buffalo, are mixed with tin; and even they are frequently flattened by the concu&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>THE Sheep, in its pre&s;ent dome&s;tic &s;tate, &s;eems &s;o far removed from a &s;tate of nature, that it may be deemed a difficult matter to point out its origin. Cli|mate, food, and above all, the unwearied arts of cultiva|tion, contribute to render this animal, in a peculiar man|ner, the creature of man; to whom it is obliged to tru&s;t entirely for its protection, and to who&s;e nece&s;&s;ities it largely contributes. Though &s;ingularly inoffen&s;ive, and harmle&s;s even to a proverb, it does not appear to be that &s;tupid, inanimate creature de&s;cribed by Buffon, "devoid of every nece&s;&s;ary art of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, without cou|rage, and even deprived of every in&s;tinctive faculty, we are led to conclude, that the Sheep, of all other animals, is the mo&s;t contemptible and &s;tupid:" But amid&s;t tho&s;e numerous flocks which range without controul on exten|&s;ive mountains, where they &s;eldom depend upon the aid of the &s;hepherd, it will be found to a&s;&s;ume a very different character: In tho&s;e &s;ituations a Ram or a Wedder will
<PB N="37" REF="44">
boldly attack a &s;ingle Dog, and often come off victorious: But when the danger is more alarming, they have re|cour&s;e to the collected &s;trength of the whole flock. On &s;uch occa&s;ions they draw up into a compact body, placing the young and the females in the center; while the males take the foremo&s;t ranks, keeping clo&s;e by each other. Thus an armed front is pre&s;ented on all quarters, and cannot ea&s;ily be attacked without danger of de&s;truction to the a&s;&s;ailant. In this manner they wait with firmne&s;s the approach of the enemy; nor does their courage fail them in the moment of attack: For when the aggre&s;&s;or advances within a few yards of the line, the Rams dart upon him with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity as lays him dead at their feet, unle&s;s he &s;ave him&s;elf by flight. Again&s;t the attacks of &s;ingle Dogs or Foxes, when in this &s;ituation, they are perfectly &s;ecure.&mdash;A Ram, regardle&s;s of danger, will &s;ome|times engage a Bull; and his forehead being much harder than that of any other animal, he &s;eldom fails to conquer: For the Bull, by lowering his head, receives the &s;troke of the Ram between his eyes, which u&s;ually brings him to the ground.</P>
<P>In the &s;election of their food, few animals di&s;cover greater &s;agacity than the Sheep; nor does any dome&s;tic animal &s;hew more dexterity and cunning in its attempts to elude the vigilance of the &s;hepherd, in order to &s;teal &s;uch delicacies as are agreeable to its palate. Be&s;ides its hardine&s;s in enduring great &s;everities of weather, the na|tural in&s;tinct of the Sheep in fore&s;eeing the approach of a &s;torm is no le&s;s remarkable: In their endeavours to &s;ecure them&s;elves under the &s;helter of &s;ome hill, whole flocks have frequently been buried for many days under a cover|ing of &s;now, and have afterwards been taken out with|out

any material injury. Thus beautifully de&s;cribed by Thomp&s;on:&mdash;
<Q><L>&mdash;Oft the whirlwind's wing</L>
<L>Sweeps up the burthen of whole wintry plains</L>
<L>At one wide wa&s;t; and o'er the haple&s;s flocks,</L>
<L>Hid in the hollow of two neighbouring hills,</L>
<L>The billowy tempe&s;t whelms.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>There have been in&s;tances where Sheep, at the ap|proach of a &s;torm, have fled for &s;helter to a neighbouring cottage, and taken refuge under the &s;ame roof with their &s;hepherd.</P>
<P>The variety in this creature is &s;o great, that &s;carcely any two countries produce Sheep of the &s;ame kind; there is found a manife&s;t difference in all, either in the &s;ize, the covering, the &s;hape, or the horns.</P>
<P>The woolly Sheep is found only in Europe and in the temperate provinces of A&s;ia: When tran&s;ported into warmer climates, it lo&s;es its wool, and becomes hairy and rough; it is likewi&s;e le&s;s fertile, and its fle&s;h no longer retains the &s;ame flavour.</P>
<P>No country produces finer Sheep than Great-Britain: Their fleeces are large, and well adapted to the various purpo&s;es of cloathing. The Spani&s;h fleeces are indeed finer, but &s;tand in no degree of compari&s;on with tho&s;e of Lincoln&s;hire or Warwick&s;hire for weight or utility. In Edward the Third's time, when wool was allowed to be exported, it brought 150,000l. per annum, at 2l. 10s. a pack, which was a great &s;um in tho&s;e days: At this time, when our woollen-manufactory &s;tands unrivalled by any nation in the world, and every method is taken to prevent this valuable commodity from being &s;ent out of the kingdom, the annual value of wool &s;horn in Eng|land,
<PB N="39" REF="46">
is e&s;timated at two millions &s;terling, and when ma|nufactured, at no le&s;s than &s;ix millions.</P>
<P>Like other ruminating animals, the Sheep wants the upper fore-teeth: It has eight in the lower jaw, two of which drop out, and are replaced at two years old; four of them art renewed at three years, and the remainder at the age of four.</P>
<P>The Ewe produces one or two lambs at a time, and &s;ometimes, though rarely, three or four; bears her young five months, and brings forth in the &s;pring. The Ram lives to the age of about fifteen years, and begins to pro|create at one. When ca&s;trated, they are called Wedders. They then grow &s;ooner fat, and the fle&s;h becomes finer and better flavoured.</P>
<P>There is hardly any part of this animal that is not &s;er|viceable to man: Of the fleece we make our cloths; the &s;kin produces leather, of which are made gloves, parch|ment, and covers for books; the entrails are formed into &s;trings for fiddles and other mu&s;ical in&s;truments, like|wi&s;e coverings for whips; its milk affords both butter and chee&s;e; and its fle&s;h is a delicate and whole&s;ome food.</P>
<P>The following remarks, taken from Mr Cully's "Ob|&s;ervations on live &s;tock," will not be unacceptable to ma|ny of our readers, as they convey a ju&s;t idea of &s;ome of the mo&s;t noted kinds of Sheep at this time in the i&s;land. He begins with tho&s;e of Lincoln&s;hire, which are of a large &s;ize, big-boned, and afford a greater quantity of wool than any other kind, owing to the rich, fat mar&s;hes on which they feed; but their fle&s;h is coar&s;e, leaner, and not &s;o finely flavoured as that of &s;maller Sheep: The &s;ame breed extends, with &s;ome variations, through mo&s;t of the
<PB N="40" REF="47">
midland counties of England: But the large&s;t breed of Sheep in this i&s;land, is to be met with on the banks of the Tees, which runs through a rich and fertile country, di|viding the two counties of York&s;hire and Durham: This kind differs from the preceding, in their wool not being &s;o long and heavy; their legs are longer, but finer boned, and &s;upport a thicker, firmer carca&s;e; their fle&s;h is like|wi&s;e much fatter, and finer grained: The&s;e Sheep weigh from twenty-five to forty-five pounds per quarter; &s;ome have been fed to fifty pounds; and one in particular was killed, which weighed &s;ixty-two pounds ten ounces per quarter, avoirdupois&mdash;a circum&s;tance never before heard of in this i&s;land. The Ewes of this breed generally bring forth two lambs each &s;ea&s;on; &s;ometimes three, four, and even five. As an in&s;tance of extraordinary fecundity, it de&s;erves to be mentioned, that one of the&s;e Ewes, at the age of two years, brought forth four lambs at one time, the next &s;ea&s;on five, both within eleven months. The Dor&s;et&s;hire breed is likewi&s;e remarkably prolific, the Ewes being capable of bringing forth twice a-year: It is from the&s;e, that the tables of our nobility and gentry are &s;up|plied with early lamb at Chri&s;tmas, or &s;ooner if required. Great numbers of tho&s;e early victims to luxury are year|ly &s;ent to the London markets, where they are &s;old at the enormous price of 10s. 6d. or perhaps 15s. per quarter.</P>
<P>The manner of rearing the lambs is curious: They are impri&s;oned in little dark cabins; the Ewes are fed with oil-cakes, hay, corn, turnips, cabbages, or any other food which the &s;ea&s;on of the year affords; the&s;e are given them in a field contiguous to the apartments where the lambs are kept; and at proper intervals, the nur&s;es are brought in to give &s;uck to their young ones; while the <PB N="41" REF="48">
attendants, at the &s;ame time, make their lodgings perfect|ly clean, and litter them with fre&s;h draw. Great atten|tion is paid to this, as much of the &s;ucce&s;s of rearing the&s;e un&s;ea&s;onable productions depends upon warmth and cleanline&s;s.</P>
<P>The Dor&s;et&s;hire Sheep are mo&s;tly white-faced; their legs are long and &s;mall, and great numbers of them have no wool upon their bellies, which gives them an uncouth appearance. They produce a &s;mall quantity of wool, but of a good quality, from which our fine Wilt&s;hire cloths are made. The mutton of the&s;e Sheep is very &s;weet and well flavoured. The variations of this breed are &s;pread through mo&s;t of the &s;outhern counties; but the true kind is only to be found in Dor&s;et&s;hire and Wilt&s;hire. There is a breed, not unlike this, in Norfolk and Suffolk; but they are all grey or black-faced.</P>
<P>The north-we&s;t part of York&s;hire, with all that moun|tainous tract of country running towards Lanca&s;hire &s;outhward, and to Fort William northward, is occupied by a hardy, black-faced, wild-looking tribe, generally called &s;hort Sheep, which differ from our other breeds not only in the darkne&s;s of their complexions and horns, but principally in the coar&s;e &s;haggy wool which they produce, not much unlike the hair growing upon a water-&s;paniel. Their eyes have a very &s;harp and wild ca&s;t; they run with a&s;toni&s;hing agility, and &s;eem quite adapted to the heathy mountains they inhabit. Their fle&s;h is pe|culiarly fine and high flavoured. The three great fairs for the&s;e Sheep (where amazing numbers of them are &s;old every year) are, Stag&s;hawbank, in Northumberland; Brough, in We&s;tmorland; and Linton, in Scotland.&mdash; There is likewi&s;e a breed of Sheep inhabiting the &s;ame
<PB N="42" REF="49">
country as the former, but peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;hed from them by long, thin bodies, white legs, white faces, and by having no horns. Their wool is fine, and thickly planted.</P>
<P>The Sheep in the low parts of Northumberland are of a mixed breed, between the long kind, the Tees water, and the Lincoln&s;hire. The mug or muff kind was for|merly common in that county: They were &s;o called from their wool growing round their heads into their very eyes, &s;o as almo&s;t to prevent them from &s;eeing. This breed is now nearly exploded, being con&s;idered, by every breeder of experience, as unprofitable, from their thriving &s;lowly, and being very tender.</P>
<P>In the northern di&s;tricts of Scotland, and in many of the i&s;lands, there is a breed of Sheep which differs from the others in the &s;mallne&s;s of their &s;ize, many of them when fed weighing no more than &s;ix, &s;even, or eight pounds per quarter. They have dun faces, without horns; and their wool, which is very fine, is variou&s;ly mixed, and &s;treaked with black, brown, and red.</P>
<P>To the&s;e various and numerous tribes of this u&s;eful animal, we mu&s;t add, that, by the per&s;evering indu&s;try and attention of Mr Bakewell, of Di&s;hley, in Leice&s;ter|&s;hire, our breed of Sheep has been greatly improved; and he has been followed by many eminent breeders, with nearly equal &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to be generally agreed, that in Sheep, as well as in all other animals, there is a certain &s;ymmetry or proportion of parts, which is be&s;t adapted to the &s;ize of each particular animal: All tho&s;e of each kind that ex|ceed, or fall &s;hort of this pitch, are more or le&s;s di&s;pro|portioned, according to the &s;ize they attain to; and in
<PB N="43" REF="50">
the degree they are advanced beyond this line of per|fection, we find them le&s;s active, weaker, and always le&s;s able to endure hard&s;hip. Thus, by &s;electing the hand&s;ome&s;t and be&s;t proportioned of their kinds, the ju|dicious breeder has gradually arrived at a degree of per|fection in improving this animal, unknown at any former period.</P>

<P>The &s;uperior qualities of the Leice&s;ter&s;hire breed are, that they will feed quickly fat at almo&s;t any age, even on indifferent pa&s;tures, and carry the greate&s;t quantity of mutton upon the &s;malle&s;t bone. Their carca&s;es are round, have remarkably broad backs, and &s;hort legs; and to &s;hew the immen&s;e weight to which they may be fed, we give the mea&s;urement of a Ram of Mr Bake|well's, mentioned by Young in his "Ea&s;tern Tour:"&mdash; At three years old his girt was five feet ten inches; height, two feet five inches; breadth over his &s;houlders,
<PB N="44" REF="51">
one foot eleven inches and an half; breadth over his ribs, one foot ten inches and an half; breadth over his hips, one foot nine inches and an half.</P>
<P>This breed is now become &s;o eminent, and &s;o much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ought after, that Mr Bakewell has this year (1788) let out Rams, for one &s;ea&s;on only, for from fifty to as high as four hundred guineas each; and we hope, in a little time, to &s;ee it become more general, as it is a maxim which every farmer can ea&s;ily comprehend, that what|ever breed the &s;ame quantity of pa&s;ture goes farthe&s;t to|wards feeding fat, is certainly the mo&s;t de&s;irable.</P>
<P>This valuable breed has al&s;o found its way into North|umberland. Me&s;&s;. Donkin and Co. of Hexham brewery, have procured a large &s;tock of both Ewes and Rams, (from one of the latter the preceding cut was drawn). Me&s;&s;. Culley, of Fenton, and Mr Thomp&s;on, of Lilburn, have al&s;o, by a mixture of this with other kinds, improved their breeds of Sheep to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the neigh|bouring farmers and graziers, who are now fully con|vinced of its great &s;uperiority.</P>
<P>We are favoured by Mr Culley with the following ac|count of a Wedder of his breed, fed at Fenton, in North|umberland, and killed at Alnwick in October, 1787, when four years old:&mdash;His dimen&s;ions were as follow,&mdash;girt, four feet eight inches and an half; breadth over his &s;houl|ders, one foot three inches; over his middle, one foot &s;e|ven inches and a quarter; acro&s;s the brea&s;t, from the in|&s;ide of one fore-leg to the in&s;ide of the other, nine inches.</P>
<P>At the dividing of the quarters, through the ribs it mea&s;ured &s;even inches and one-eighth of &s;olid fat, cut &s;traight through without any &s;lope; and his mutton was of the mo&s;t beautiful bright colour: But in nothing was
<PB N="45" REF="52">
he &s;o remarkable, as in the &s;mallne&s;s of his bones. The proprietor of this Sheep laments, that he had not the of|fals exactly weighed (by offals, we would be under&s;tood to mean not only the tallow, but the head, pluck, and pelt, with the blood and entrails); becau&s;e it is now well known, that this breed of Sheep has a greater quantity of mutton, in proportion to their offals, than any other kind we know of, and is con&s;equently cheaper to the con&s;umer.</P>

When the drawing was made, they had ju&s;t been &s;horn; at other times the wool is &s;o long and thick, that their form cannot be well di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>

<P>The Iceland Sheep, as well as tho&s;e of Mu&s;covy and the colde&s;t climates of the Norths re&s;emble our own in the form of the body, but differ in the number of their horns, having generally four, and &s;ometimes eight, grow|ing from the forehead: Their wool is long, &s;mooth, and hairy: They are of a dark-brown colour; and under the outward coat of hair, which drops off at &s;tated periods, there is an internal covering re&s;embling fur, which is fine, &s;hort, and &s;oft;&mdash;the quantity produced by each Sheep, is about four pounds.</P>
<P>The broad-tailed Sheep, common in Per&s;ia, Barbary, Syria, and Egypt, are remarkable chiefly for their large and heavy tails, which grow a foot broad, and &s;o long, that the &s;hepherds are obliged to put boards with &s;mall wheels under them, to keep them from galling. The fle&s;h of these tails is e&s;teemed a great delicacy; it is of a &s;ub&s;tance between fat and marrow, and eaten with the

</FIGURE> THE MOUFLON, OR MUSMON,</HEAD>
<P>WHICH, by &s;ome authors, has been cla&s;&s;ed with the Sheep, and by others has been referred to the Goat kind, may not improperly be con&s;idered as &s;tanding in a middle place, and forming the link between each: For it is curious to ob&s;erve, that Nature, in all her variations, proceeds by &s;low and almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible degrees, &s;carcely drawing a firm and di&s;tingui&s;hing line between any two races of animals that are e&s;&s;entially different, and yet, in many re&s;pects, nearly allied to each other. In all tran&s;itions from one kind to the other, there is to be found a middle race, that &s;eems to partake of the nature of both, and that can preci&s;ely be referred to neither. Thus it is hard to di&s;cover where the Sheep kind ends, or the Goat begins. The Mu&s;mon therefore, which is nei|ther Sheep nor Goat, has many marks of both, and forms the link between the two kinds. Though covered with hair, it bears a &s;trong &s;imilitude to the Ram: Its eyes are placed near the horns, and its ears are &s;horter than tho&s;e of the Goat; its horns re&s;emble tho&s;e of the Ram,
<PB N="51" REF="58">
in being of a yellow colour and a triangular &s;hape; they likewi&s;e bend backward behind the ears: In &s;ome they grow to an amazing &s;ize, mea&s;uring above two yards long. They often maintain furious battles with each other, in which their horns are frequently broken off. The general colour of the hair is reddi&s;h-brown; the in|&s;ide of the thighs and belly is white tinctured with yel|low; the muzzle and in&s;ide of the ears are of a whiti&s;h colour tinctured with yellow; the other parts of the &s;ace are of a browni&s;h-grey.</P>
<P>The Mu&s;mon is found in the wild and uncultivated parts of Greece, Sardinia, Cor&s;ica, and in the de&s;arts of Tartary; where it maintains it&s;elf, by force or &s;wiftne&s;s, again&s;t the attacks of all rapacious animals.</P>
<P>It has been known to breed with the Sheep; and, from that circum&s;tance, is &s;uppo&s;ed, by M. Buffon and others, to be the primitive race. The female of this &s;pecies is rather le&s;s than the male; and her horns never grow to that prodigious &s;ize.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of Kamt&s;chatka are &s;o &s;trong, that ten men can &s;carcely hold one; and the horns are &s;o large, that young foxes often &s;helter them&s;elves in the hollow of &s;uch as fall off by accident.

</FIGURE> THE COMMON GOAT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS lively, playful, and capricious creature occu|pies the next &s;tep in the great &s;cale of Nature; and, though inferior to the Sheep in value, in various in&s;tances bears a &s;trong affinity to that u&s;eful animal. The Goat and the Sheep will propagate together: The He-Goat copulates with the Ewe, and the Ram with the She-Goat; the offspring likewi&s;e is prolific.</P>
<P>The Goat is a much more hardy animal than the Sheep, and is in every re&s;pect more fitted for a life of liberty: It is not ea&s;ily confined to a flock, but chu&s;es its own pa&s;ture, &s;traying wherever its appetite or incli|nation leads: It chiefly delights in wild and mountainous regions, climbing the loftie&s;t rocks, and &s;tanding &s;ecure on the verge of inacce&s;&s;ible and dangerous precipices; al|though, as Ray ob&s;erves, one would hardly &s;uppo&s;e that their feet were adapted to &s;uch perilous achievements; yet, upon a nearer in&s;pection, the wonder cea&s;es, and
<PB N="53" REF="60">
we find that Nature has provided them with hoofs well calculated for the purpo&s;e of climbing, being made hol|low underneath, with &s;harp edges, like the in&s;ide of a &s;poon, which prevents them from &s;liding off the&s;e rocky eminences.</P>
<P>The Goat is an animal ea&s;ily &s;u&s;tained, and is chiefly therefore the property of tho&s;e who inhabit wild and un|cultivated regions, where it finds an ample &s;upply of food from the &s;pontaneous productions of Nature, in &s;i|tuations inacce&s;&s;ible to other creatures. It delights ra|ther on the heathy mountains, or the &s;hrubby rock, than the fields cultivated by human indu&s;try. Its favourite food is the tops of the boughs, or the tender bark of young trees. It bears a warm climate better than the Sheep, and frequently &s;leeps expo&s;ed to the hotte&s;t rays of the &s;un.</P>
<P>The milk of the Goat is &s;weet, nouri&s;hing, and medi|cinal, being found highly beneficial in con&s;umptive ca&s;es: It is not &s;o apt to curdle upon the &s;tomach as that of the Cow. From the &s;hrubs and heath on which it feeds, the milk of the Goat acquires a flavour and wildne&s;s of ta&s;te very different from that of either the Sheep or Cow, and is highly plea&s;ing to &s;uch as have accu&s;tomed them&s;elves to its u&s;e: It is made into whey for tho&s;e who&s;e dige&s;tion is too weak to bear it in its primitive &s;tate. Several places in the North of England and the mountainous parts of Scotland are much re&s;orted to for the purpo&s;e of drinking the milk of the Goat, and its effects have been generally &s;alutary in vitiated and debilitated habits.</P>
<P>In many parts of Ireland, and in the Highlands of Scotland, their Goats make the chief po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the inhabitants; and in mo&s;t of the mountainous parts of
<PB N="54" REF="61">
Europe, &s;upply the natives with many of the nece&s;&s;aries of life: They lie upon beds made of their &s;kins, which are &s;oft, clean, and whole&s;ome; they live upon their milk, and oat bread; they convert part of it into butter, and &s;ome into chee&s;e. The fle&s;h of the kid, which they do not allow them&s;elves to ta&s;te, is con&s;idered by the city epicure as a great rarity; and, when properly prepared, is e&s;teemed by &s;ome as little inferior to veni&s;on.</P>
<P>The Goat produces generally two young at a time, &s;ometimes three, rarely four: In warmer climates, it is more prolific, and produces four or five at once; though the breed is found to degenerate. The male is capable of propagating at one year old, and the female at &s;even months; but the fruits of a generation &s;o premature, are generally weak and defective: Their be&s;t time is at the age of two years, or eighteen months at lea&s;t. The Goat is a &s;hort-lived animal, full of ardour, but &s;oon enervated. His appetite for the female is exce&s;&s;ive, &s;o that one buck is &s;ufficient for one hundred and fifty females.</P>

</FIGURE> THE CHAMOIS GOAT.</HEAD>
<P>The Chamois, though a wild animal, is very ea&s;ily tamed, and docile; and to be found only in rocky and mountainous places. It is about the &s;ize of a dome&s;tic Goat, and re&s;embles one in many re&s;pects. It is mo&s;t agreeably lively, and active beyond expre&s;&s;ion. The
<PB N="57" REF="64">
hair is &s;hort, like that of the Doe; in &s;pring it is of an a&s;h colour, in autumn a dun colour, inclining to black, and in winter of a blacki&s;h brown. This ani|mal is found in great plenty in the mountains of Dau|phiny, of Piedmont, Savoy, Switzerland, and Germany. They are peaceful, gentle creatures, and live in &s;ociety with each other. They are found in flocks of from four to four&s;core, and even an hundred, di&s;per&s;ed upon the crags of the mountains. The large males are &s;een feed|ing detached from the re&s;t, except in rutting time, when they approach the females, and drive away the young. The time of their coupling is from the beginning of No|vember to the end of October; and they bring forth in April and March. The young keep with the dam for about five months, and &s;ometimes longer, if the hunters and the wolves do not &s;eparate them. It is a&s;&s;erted, that they live between twenty and thirty years. Their fle&s;h is good to eat; and they are found to have ten or twelve pounds of &s;uet, which far &s;urpa&s;&s;es that of the Goat in hardne&s;s and goodne&s;s. The Chamois has &s;carce any cry, as mo&s;t animals are known to have; if it has any, it is a kind of feeble bleat, by which the parent calls its young: But in ca&s;es of danger, and when it is to warn the re&s;t of the flock, it u&s;es an hi&s;&s;ing noi&s;e, which is heard at a great di&s;tance: For it is to be ob&s;erved, that this creature is extremely vigilant, and has an eye the quicke&s;t and mo&s;t piercing in nature. Its &s;mell al&s;o is not le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hing. When it &s;ees its enemy di&s;tinct|ly, it &s;tops for a moment; and then, if the per&s;on be near, in an in&s;tant after it flies off. In the &s;ame man|ner, by its &s;mell, it can di&s;cover a man at half a league di&s;tance, and gives the earlie&s;t notice. Upon any alarm,
<PB N="58" REF="65">
therefore, or any apprehen&s;ions of danger, the Chamois begins his hi&s;&s;ing rote with &s;uch force, that the rocks and the fore&s;ts re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cho to the &s;ound. The fir&s;t hi&s;s con|tinues as long as the time of one in&s;piration: In the be|ginning it is very &s;harp, and deeper towards the clo&s;e. The animal having, after this fir&s;t alarm, repo&s;ed a mo|ment, again looks round, and, perceiving the reality of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fears, continues to hi&s;s by intervals, until it has &s;pread the alarm to a very great di&s;tance. During this time it &s;eems in the mo&s;t violent agitation; it &s;trikes the ground with its fore-&s;oo, and &s;ometimes with both; it bounds from rock to rock; it turns and looks round; it runs to the edge of the precipice; and, &s;till perceiving the ene|my, flies with all its &s;peed. The hi&s;&s;ing of the male is much louder and &s;harper than that of the female; it is performed through the no&s;e, and is properly no more than a very &s;trong breath driven violently through a &s;mall aperture.</P>
<P>The Chamois feeds upon the be&s;t herbage, and chu&s;es the mo&s;t delicate parts of the plants, the flowers, and the tender buds. It is not le&s;s delicate with regard to &s;everal aromatic herbs, which grow upon the &s;ides of the mountains. It drinks but very little while it feeds upon the &s;ucculent herbage, and chews the cud in the intervals of feeding.</P>
<P>This animal is greatly admired for the beauty of its eyes, which are round and &s;parkling, and which mark the warmth of its con&s;titution. Its head is furni&s;hed with two &s;mall horns of about half a foot long, of a beautiful black, and ri&s;ing from the forehead almo&s;t be|twixt the eyes: The&s;e, contrary to what is found in other animals, in&s;tead of going backwards or &s;ideways,
<PB N="59" REF="66">
&s;tand forward, and bend a little backward at their ex|tremities, ending in a very &s;harp point. The ears are placed in a very elegant manner, near the horns; and there are two &s;tripes of black on each &s;ide of the face, the re&s;t being of a whiti&s;h yellow, which never changes. The horns of the female are le&s;s, and not &s;o much bent; the natives have been known to bleed cattle with them.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals are &s;o much incommoded by heat, that they are never found in &s;ummer, except in the caverns of rocks, amid&s;t fragments of unmelted ice, under the &s;hade of high and &s;preading trees, or of rough and hang|ing precipices, that face the North, and which keep off entirely the rays of the &s;un. They go to pa&s;ture both morning and evening, and &s;eldom during the heat of the day. They run along the rocks with great ea&s;e and &s;eeming indifference, and leap from one to another, &s;o that no Dogs are able to pur&s;ue them. There is nothing more extraordinary than to &s;ee them climbing and de|&s;ending precipices, that to all other quadrupeds are in|acce&s;&s;ible: They always mount or de&s;cend in an oblique direction; and throw them&s;elves down a rock of thirty feet, and light with great &s;ecurity upon &s;ome excre&s;cence or fragment, on the &s;ide of the precipice, which is ju&s;t large enough to place their feet upon; they &s;trike the rock, however, in their de&s;cent with their feet, three or four times, to &s;top the velocity of their motion; and, when they have got upon the ba&s;e below, they at once &s;eem fixed and &s;ecure. In fact, to &s;ee them jump in this manner, they &s;eem rather to have wings than legs. Cer|tain it is, that their legs are formed for this arduous employment; the hinder being rather longer than the
<PB N="60" REF="67">
former, and bending in &s;uch a manner, that, when they de&s;cend upon them, they break the force of the fall.</P>
<P>During the rigours of winter, the Chamois &s;leeps in the thicker fore&s;ts, and feeds upon the &s;hrubs and the buds of the pine-tree. It &s;ometimes turns up the &s;now with its foot, to look for herbage; and, where it is green, makes a delicious repa&s;t. The more craggy and uneven the fore&s;t, the more this animal is plea&s;ed with the abode, which thus adds to its &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>The hunting the Chamois is very laborious, and ex|tremely difficult. The mo&s;t u&s;ual way is to hide behind the clefts of the rocks, and &s;hoot them. Some al&s;o pur|&s;ue this animal as they do the Stag, by placing proper per&s;ons at all the pa&s;&s;ages of a glade or valley, and then &s;ending in others to rou&s;e the game. Dogs are quite u&s;ele&s;s in this chace, as they rather alarm than overtake: Nor is it without danger even to the men; for it often happens, that when the animal finds it&s;elf overpre&s;&s;ed, it drives at the hunter with its head, and often tumbles him down the neighbouring precipice. This animal cannot go upon ice when &s;mooth; but if there be the lea&s;t inequalities on its &s;urface, it then bounds along in &s;ecurity, and quickly evades all pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>The &s;kin of the Chamois was once famous, when tan|ned, for its &s;oftne&s;s and warmth; at pre&s;ent, however, &s;ince the art of tanning has been brought to greater per|fection, the leather called &s;hammoy is made al&s;o from tho&s;e of the tame Goat, the Sheep, and the Deer.</P>

</FIGURE> THE BOSCH-BOK, OR WOOD GOAT.</HEAD>
<P>We are indebted to the indefatigable labours of Dr Sparrman for an accurate de&s;cription of this rare animal, which is found in the country about the Cape of Good Hope, and is the only one among the African Gazelles, that can be properly &s;aid to live in the woods and groves, from whence it derives its name.</P>
<P>The horns of this animal are black, &s;omewhat more than ten inches long, and have three &s;ides wreathed in a &s;piral direction towards the top; at the bottom they are rough, in con&s;equence of a number of wavy rings, which however are not elevated much above the &s;urface; at the top they are round, &s;harp-pointed, and in that part as &s;mooth as if they had been poli&s;hed; their po&s;ition is al|mo&s;t in the &s;ame line with the forehead, inclining a lit|tle forwards, and, by means of the twi&s;t they make, recede from each other towards the middle; they are
<PB N="68" REF="75">
there three inches and a half di&s;tant; at the ba&s;e they are only one inch.</P>
<P>The Wood Goat is &s;omewhat more than two feet and a half high, of a dark-brown colour, in &s;ome parts bor|dering upon black; on each cheek-bone there are two large round white &s;pots; another, &s;till larger, occupies the fore part of the neck, &s;omewhat below the top of the windpipe; and &s;everal &s;maller white &s;pots are &s;cattered over the haunches; a narrow line of white hair extends from the neck all along the back and tail, but is not ea&s;i|ly di&s;tingui&s;hed, being hid by the length of the dark-brown hairs on the top of the back, which are three or four inches long, &s;o as to form a kind of mane; the hair on the head is very &s;hort and fine, in other parts of the body it is longer, re&s;embling that of Goats; its tail is not more than a finger's breadth in length, covered with long hairs, which extend down the hind part of the thighs and buttocks; the legs and feet are &s;lender; the fetlock joints are likewi&s;e &s;mall; the no&s;e and under lip, which are white, are decorated with black whi&s;kers about an inch long.</P>
<P>As this creature runs but &s;lowly, he is &s;ometimes caught with Dogs: When he finds there is no other re|&s;ource, he boldly puts him&s;elf into a po&s;ture of defence; and, when going to butt, kneels down, and in that po|&s;ition fells his life at a very dear rate, killing and gor|ing &s;ome of the be&s;t and mo&s;t &s;pirited hounds. Its horns, which are its chief defence, &s;ometimes prove its bane, by entangling it in the bu&s;hes; to avoid this, it carries its no&s;e horizontally and &s;traight forward while it runs, &s;o that they lie directly on its neck. The female, which is without horns, on that account runs more freely through
<PB N="69" REF="76">
the fore&s;ts, and does not &s;uffer her&s;elf &s;o ea&s;ily to be hunted out of the woods, having there, as well as on the plains, much greater &s;ecurity again&s;t the Dogs in her &s;wiftne&s;s, than the male has in his horns, e&s;pecially as &s;he is not &s;o bulky and heavy as the male. Her brea&s;t is &s;aid to be very plump; but the fle&s;h of this animal is not very tender.</P>

<P>The <HI>White Antelope,</HI> which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;ame with the <HI>Pygarg,</HI> mentioned in the book of Numbers, is an inhabitant of the Cape of Good Hope, where it is called the <HI>Spring-bok;</HI> and is to be &s;een in herds of &s;e|veral thou&s;ands, covering the plains as far as the eye can reach. Sparrman &s;ays, that, having &s;hot at a large herd
<PB N="70" REF="77">
of them, they formed a line, and immediately made a circular movement, as if to &s;urround him; but after|wards flew off in different directions.</P>
<P>The height of this beautiful creature is two feet and a half; and, from the ears to the tail, &s;omewhat above three feet: The tail is rather le&s;s than a foot long: The length of the ears is &s;ix inches and a half; that of the horns, mea&s;uring them along their curvatures, nine inches; and their di&s;tance at the ba&s;e, where they are nearly three inches thick, is one inch; they gradually widen from thence to the di&s;tance of five inches from each other, when they turn inwards, &s;o that at the tip they are not above three inches and a half a&s;under; they are of a deep black colour, annulated above half way up; toward the top they are quite &s;mooth, and end in a &s;harp point.</P>
<P>The predominant colour of this animal is brown, or a light-ru&s;t colour; the po&s;terior moiety of the ridge of the back is white, which colour is continued over and round the anus, the in&s;ide of the haunches, the belly, and the fore legs, excepting a narrow &s;tripe of brown in the front of each; the head is white, except a dark-brown li&s;t on each &s;ide, of the breadth of an inch, which pa&s;&s;es from the corner of the mouth over the eyes to the horns; a &s;tripe, an inch and a half broad, of the &s;ame deep umber colour, extends from the &s;houlders to the haunches, form|ing thus a boundary between the &s;nowy whitene&s;s of the belly and the ru&s;ty colour of the &s;ides: The tail, at lea&s;t the lower part of it, is not thicker than a goo&s;e-quill; the under &s;ide is quite bare; but towards the tip there are a few dark-brown hairs from one to two inches and a half long: The ears are of an a&s;h colour, tipt on the
<PB N="71" REF="78">
edges with fine light-grey hairs: The eye-brows and whi&s;kers are black: The hair in general is fine and &s;hort; but the dark fine which borders upon the white, con&s;i&s;ts of longer hairs, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;erves to cover the dazzling whitene&s;s of the creature's back, the purity of which &s;eems to be by this means pre&s;erved; for on certain occa&s;ions the animal is able to expand the&s;e hairs to the breadth of eight or nine inches, particularly on taking a high leap, which it never fails to do when it is pur&s;ued; and then it is no le&s;s plea&s;ant than curious to &s;ee the whole herd jumping over each other's heads to the height of two yards, and &s;ometimes higher; &s;ome of them will take three or four high leaps &s;ucce&s;&s;ively: In this &s;itua|tion, they &s;eem to be &s;u&s;pended in the air, and look over their &s;houlders at their pur&s;uers; at the &s;ame time &s;hewing the white part of their backs in a mo&s;t beautiful manner.</P>
<P>When hunted, the&s;e animals &s;uffer them&s;elves &s;oon to be di&s;per&s;ed; and when the whole flock has got to &s;ome di&s;tance, they will all make a &s;tand, and turn round to look at their pur&s;uers, at the &s;ame time expanding the white hairs on their backs.</P>
<P>The Spring-boks are &s;o extremely &s;wift, as to require a good Hor&s;e to overtake them; although they are &s;ome|times bold enough to allow a &s;port&s;man, either on foot or on hor&s;eback, to come within gun&s;hot of them.&mdash; Their fle&s;h is very palatable, and has a more juicy and delicate ta&s;te than that of the other Gazelles.</P>

The general colour of the Hart-bee&s;t is that of cinnamon; the front of the head is marked with black, as is likewi&s;e the fore part of the legs; the hind part of the haunch is covered with a wide black &s;treak, which reaches down to the knee; a narrow &s;tripe of black begins behind each ear,
<PB N="75" REF="82">
and runs all along the ridge of the neck; a dark-brown oval &s;pot extends over the back, terminating ju&s;t above the tail, which is &s;lender, &s;omething like that of an A&s;s, and is covered with &s;trong black hairs about &s;ix inches long. There is a pore about an inch below the eye, from which a matter is di&s;tilled, &s;omewhat like ear-wax, which the Hottentots carefully pre&s;erve as a rare and ex|cellent medicine.</P>
<P>This animal is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the <HI>Bubalus</HI> of the an|cients, is the <HI>Cervine Antelope</HI> of Mr Pennant, and the <HI>Bubale</HI> of M. Buffon.</P>
<P>The hair of the Hart-bee&s;t is very fine, and its long ears are covered with white hair on the in&s;ide; it has only eight teeth in the lower jaw, none in the upper; the legs are rather &s;lender, with &s;mall fetlocks and hoofs.</P>
<P>The large head and high forehead, together with the a&s;&s;inine ears and tail of the Hart-bee&s;t, render it one of the lea&s;t hand&s;ome of the whole tribe of Antelopes: Its pace, when at full &s;peed, appears like a heavy gallop; notwith&s;tanding which, it runs as fa&s;t as any of the large Antelopes: When it has once got a-head of its pur&s;uers, it is very apt to turn round, and &s;tare them full in the face.

<P>The Koedoe, though a tall and &s;lender animal, is not &s;o &s;wift as many of the Gazelle kind, and is ea&s;ily over|taken by the hounds: On the&s;e occa&s;ions the males de|fend them&s;elves with great &s;pirit with their horns, and will come to clo&s;e quarters with the Dogs; but the fe|males having no horns, are obliged to depend on their &s;peed.</P>

</FIGURE> THE NYL-GHAU.</HEAD>
<P>THIS animal is a native of the interior parts of In|dia. &mdash;It &s;eems to be of a middle nature, between the Cow and the Deer, and carries the appearance of both in its form. In &s;ize, it is as much &s;maller than the one, as it is larger than the other: Its body, horns, and tail, are not unlike tho&s;e of a bull; and the head, neck, and legs, are very like tho&s;e of a Deer. The colour, in general, is a&s;h or grey, from a mixture of black hairs and white; all along the ridge or edge of the neck, the hair is blacker, longer, and more erect, making a &s;hort, thin, and upright mane, reaching down to the hump. Its horns are &s;even inches long, &s;ix inches round at the root, tapering by degrees, and terminate in a blunt point.
<PB N="86" REF="93">
The ears are large and beautiful, &s;even inches in length, and &s;pread to a con&s;iderable breadth near their end: They are white on the edge and on the in&s;ide, except where two black bands mark the hollow of the ear with a Zebra-like variety. The height of this animal at the &s;houlder is four feet one inch; behind the loins, it only mea&s;ures four feet.</P>
<P>The female differs con&s;iderably from the male both in height and thickne&s;s, being much &s;maller; in &s;hape and colour very much re&s;embling a Deer; and has no horns. She has four nipples; and is &s;uppo&s;ed to go nine months with young. She commonly has one at a birth, but &s;ometimes two.</P>
<P>Several of this &s;pecies were brought to this country in the year 1767, which continued to breed annually for &s;ome years after.&mdash;Dr Hunter, who had one of them in his cu&s;tody for &s;ome time, de&s;cribes it as a harmle&s;s and gentle animal; that is &s;eemed plea&s;ed with every kind of familiarity, always licked the hand that either &s;troaked or fed it, and never once attempted to u&s;e its horns of|fen&s;ively. It &s;eemed to have much dependence on its or|gans of &s;mell; and &s;nuffed keenly whenever any per&s;on came in &s;ight: It did &s;o likewi&s;e, when food or drink was brought to it; and would not ta&s;te the bread which was offered, if the hand that pre&s;ented it happened to &s;mell of turpentine.</P>
<P>Its manner of fighting is very particular, and is thus de&s;cribed:&mdash;Two of the males at Lord Clive's, being put into an inclo&s;ure, were ob&s;erved, while they were at &s;ome di&s;tance from each other, to prepare for the attack, by falling down upon their knees. They then &s;huffled towards each other, keeping &s;till upon their knees; and
<PB N="87" REF="94">
at the di&s;tance of a few yards, they made a &s;pring, and darted again&s;t each other with great force.</P>
<P>The following anecdote will &s;erve to &s;hew, that, dur|ing the rutting &s;ea&s;on, the&s;e animals are fierce and vi|cious, and not to be depended upon:&mdash;A labouring man, without knowing that the animal was near him, went up to the out&s;ide of the inclo&s;ure; the Nyl-ghau, with the quickne&s;s of lightning, darted again&s;t the wood-work with &s;uch violence, that he broke it to pieces, and broke off one of his horns clo&s;e to the root. The death of the animal, which happened &s;oon after, was &s;uppo&s;ed to be owing to the injury he &s;u&s;tained by the blow.</P>
<P>Bernier &s;ays, that it is the favourite amu&s;ement of the Mogul emperor to hunt the Nyl-ghau; and that he kills them in &s;uch numbers, as to di&s;tribute quarters of them to all his omrahs; which &s;hews that they are e&s;teemed good and delicious food.</P>
<P>The Nyl-ghau is frequently brought from the interior parts of A&s;ia as a rare and valuable pre&s;ent to the nabobs and other great men at our &s;ettlements in India.</P>
<P>It remains to be con&s;idered, whether this rare animal might not be propagated with &s;ucce&s;s in this country. That it will breed here is evident from experience; and if it &s;hould prove docile enough to be ea&s;ily trained to labour, its great &s;wiftne&s;s and con&s;iderable &s;trength might be applied to the mo&s;t valuable purpo&s;es.</P>

<P>THERE have been various accounts given of this animal by naturali&s;ts and travellers; by whom it &s;eems to have been taken notice of more for the perfume which it produces, than for the information of the cu|rious enquirer into its nature and qualities: For we are &s;till at a lo&s;s what rank to a&s;&s;ign it among the various tribes of quadrupeds. It has no horns; and whether it ruminates or not is uncertain: But by its wanting the fore-teeth in the upper jaw, we are led to &s;uppo&s;e that it belongs either to the Goat or the Deer kind; and have therefore given it a place after the Gazelles, relying up|on tho&s;e characteri&s;tic marks which are known, and leav|ing it to future hi&s;torians, who may be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of better means of information, to a&s;certain its genuine character.</P>
<P>The Mu&s;k of Thibet re&s;embles the Roe-buck in form: It is &s;omewhat above two feet in height at the &s;houlder; the hind legs are longer than the fore legs, being two
<PB N="89" REF="96">
feet nine inches high from the top of the haunches; in length, it is three feet &s;ix inches from the head to the tail; the head is above half a foot long. Its upper jaw is much larger than the lower; and on each &s;ide of it there is a &s;lender tu&s;k, near two inches long, which hangs down, bending inwards like a hook, and very &s;harp on the inner edge: Its lower jaw contains eight &s;mall cut|ting teeth; and in each jaw there are &s;ix grinders. Its ears are long, &s;mall, and erect, like tho&s;e of a Rabbit. The hair on the whole body is long and rough, marked with &s;mall waves from top to bottom; the colour is a ru&s;ty-brown; under the belly and tail it is white; on each &s;ide of the lower jaw there is a tuft of thick hair, about an inch long; its hoofs are deeply cloven, &s;lender, and black; the &s;purious hoofs are likewi&s;e very long; its tail is not more than two inches in length, and hid in the hair.&mdash;The u&s;e it makes of its tu&s;ks is not well known: The mo&s;t probable is that of hooking up roots out of the ground, and catching at &s;mall twigs and branches of trees, upon which it feeds.&mdash;The female has no tu&s;ks, is le&s;s than the male, and has two &s;mall teats.</P>
<P>The Mu&s;k is found in the kingdom of Thibet, in &s;e|veral of the Chine&s;e provinces, about the lake Baikal, and near the rivers Jeni&s;an and Argun, from lat. 60 to 45; but &s;eldom &s;o far &s;outh, except driven by great falls of &s;now to &s;eek for food in more temperate climates. It is naturally a timid animal, and endowed with a quick &s;en&s;e of hearing. Its &s;olitary haunts are u&s;ually moun|tains, covered with pines; where it avoids mankind, and, when pur&s;ued, flies to the highe&s;t and mo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible &s;ummits.</P>
<P>The perfume produced by this animal, which is &s;o well
<PB N="90" REF="97">
known in the fa&s;hionable circles, and of late &s;o much u&s;ed in the practice of phy&s;ic, needs little de&s;cription: It is found in a bag or tumor, nearly of the &s;ize of a hen's egg, on the belly of the male only. The&s;e bags the hunters cut off, and tie them up for &s;ale; many thou&s;ands of which are &s;ent over annually to Europe, be|&s;ides what are con&s;umed in different parts of the Ea&s;t. To account for this great con&s;umption, it is &s;uppo&s;ed that the mu&s;k is frequently adulterated and mixed with the blood of the animal. It comes to us from China, Tonquin, Bengal, and Mu&s;covy; but that of Thibet is reckoned the be&s;t, and &s;ells at a much higher price.</P>
<P>The fle&s;h of the males, e&s;pecially in the rutting &s;ea&s;on, is much infected with the flavour of the mu&s;k; but is, neverthele&s;s, eaten by the Ru&s;&s;ians and Tartars.</P>

<P>THIS animal (the exi&s;tence of which has frequent|ly been called in que&s;tion) is a native of the wild and unfrequented de&s;arts of Ethiopia, and other inte|rior parts of Africa; where it leads a &s;olitary life, far from the habitations of men, for who&s;e u&s;e it is rendered unfit by the enormous di&s;proportion of its parts. It has hitherto been regarded chiefly as an object of curio&s;ity; and may lead us to admire the wonderful productions of that creative Power which has filled the earth with life in &s;uch a boundle&s;s variety of forms.</P>
<P>The height of this extraordinary animal, from the crown of the head to the ground, is &s;eventeen feet; while at the rump it only mea&s;ures nine feet; the neck
<PB N="92" REF="99">
alone is &s;even feet long; and the length, from the extre|mity of the tail to the end of the no&s;e, is twenty-two feet; the fore and hind legs are nearly of an equal height; but the &s;houlders are of &s;uch a length, as to make its back incline like the roof of a hou&s;e; its neck is &s;lender and elegant, adorned on the upper &s;ide with a &s;hort mane; its head is nearly &s;imilar to that of a Stag, having two horns, &s;ix inches long, covered with hair, with tufts at the end like bri&s;tles; on the middle of the forehead &s;tands a protuberance, about two inches high, re&s;embling a third horn; its ears are long; and its eyes large and beautiful.</P>
<P>The colour of this animal is a dirty white, inter&s;per&s;ed with large &s;pots of yellow over the whole body; it is a timid and gentle creature, but not &s;wift; from the great length of its fore legs, it is obliged to divide them to a great di&s;tance when it grazes, which it does with great difficulty; it lives chiefly by brow&s;ing on the leaves and tender branches of trees; it lies on its belly, and has hard protuberances on its brea&s;t and thighs, like the Ca|mel; its tail is long, &s;lender, and covered with &s;trong hairs; its feet re&s;emble tho&s;e of an Ox; it has no teeth in the upper jaw, and is a ruminating animal; its pace is a kind of gallop.</P>
<P>This animal was known to the Romans in early times, by whom its hi&s;tory has been handed down to &s;ucceeding ages in &s;ome of their mo&s;t celebrated works of &s;culpture: It was exhibited in their games among other rare and un|common animals; and is finely and ju&s;tly de&s;cribed by Oppian.</P>

</FIGURE> THE ELK.</HEAD>
<P>THIS animal is the large&s;t and mo&s;t formidable of all the Deer kind. It is a native of both the old and the new continent, being known in Europe by the name of the <HI>Elk,</HI> and in America by that of the <HI>Moo&s;e-deer.</HI> It is &s;ometimes taken in the fore&s;ts of Ru&s;&s;ia and Germany, though rarely to be &s;een on account of its ex|treme wildne&s;s. It likewi&s;e inhabits Norway, Sweden, Poland, and Tartary, as far as the North of China. It is common in Canada, and in all the northern parts of America, where it is called by the French the <HI>Original.</HI></P>
<P>The Elk has been variou&s;ly de&s;cribed by naturali&s;ts and travellers: By &s;ome it is &s;aid to be twelve feet high; whil&s;t others, with greater appearance of probability, de|&s;cribe it as being not much higher than a Hor&s;e. It is, however, a matter of doubt to which a greater degree of credibility &s;hould be given.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="101">From a variety of Elks horns pre&s;erved in the cabinets of the curious, &s;ome of which are of a mo&s;t enormous &s;ize, there is every rea&s;on to conclude, that the animal which bore them mu&s;t have been of a proportionable bulk and &s;trength.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who &s;peak of the gigantic Moo&s;e, &s;ay, their horns are &s;ix feet long, and mea&s;ure, from tip to tip, above ten feet: The beams of the horns are &s;hort; from which they &s;pread out into large and broad palms, one &s;ide of which is plain, but on the out&s;ide are &s;everal &s;harp &s;nags or &s;hoots.</P>
<P>The European Elk grows to the height of &s;even or eight feet, and in length, from the end of the muzzle to the in&s;ertion of the tail, mea&s;ures ten feet; the head is two feet long; the neck, on which is a &s;hort, upright mane, of a light-brown colour, is much &s;horter; its eye is &s;mall, and from the lower corner of it there is a deep &s;lit, common to all the Deer kind, as well as mo&s;t of the Gazelles; the ears are upwards of a foot in length, very broad, and &s;omewhat &s;louching; the no&s;trils are wide; and the upper lip, which is &s;quare, and has a deep furrow in the middle, hangs greatly over the lower, from whence it was imagined by the ancients, that this crea|ture could not graze without going backward; the wi|thers are very high, the hind legs much &s;horter than the fore legs, and the hoofs deeply cloven; from a &s;mall ex|cre&s;cence under the throat hangs a long tuft of coar&s;e black hair; the tail is very &s;hort, du&s;ky above, and white beneath; the hair is long and rough, like a bear, and of a hoary brown colour, not much differing from that of the A&s;s.</P>
<P>The pace of the Elk is a high, &s;hambling trot; but it
<PB N="95" REF="102">
goes with great &s;wiftne&s;s.&mdash;Formerly the&s;e animals were made u&s;e of in Sweden to draw &s;ledges; but as they were frequently acce&s;&s;ary to the e&s;cape of &s;uch as had been guilty of murders or other great crimes, this u&s;e of them was prohibited under great penalties.</P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing through thick woods, the&s;e animals carry their heads horizontally, to prevent their horns being en|tangled in the branches.</P>
<P>The Elks are timid, inoffen&s;ive animals, except when wounded, or during the rutting &s;ea&s;on, when the males become very furious, and at that time will &s;wim from i&s;le to i&s;le in pur&s;uit of the females. They &s;trike with both horns and hoofs; and po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch agility and &s;trength of limbs, that with a &s;ingle blow of the fore feet they will kill a Wolf or a Dog, or even break a tree.</P>
<P>Their fle&s;h is extremely &s;weet and nouri&s;hing. The Indians &s;ay they can travel farther after eating heartily of the fle&s;h of the Elk than any other animal food. Their tongues are excellent; but the no&s;e is e&s;teemed the great|e&s;t delicacy in all Canada. The &s;kin makes excellent buff leather; and is &s;trong, &s;oft, and light. The Indians make their &s;now-&s;hoes, and likewi&s;e form their canoes, with it. The hair on the neck, withers, and hams, of a full-grown Elk, from its great length and ela&s;ticity, is well adapted to the purpo&s;e of making matra&s;&s;es and &s;addles.</P>
<P>The methods of hunting the&s;e animals in Canada are curious:&mdash;The fir&s;t, and mo&s;t &s;imple, is, before the lakes or rivers are frozen, multitudes of the natives a&s;&s;emble in their canoes, with which they form a va&s;t cre&s;cent, each horn touching the &s;hore; whil&s;t another party on the &s;hore &s;urround an exten&s;ive tract: They are attended by Dogs, which they let loo&s;e, and pre&s;s towards the water
<PB N="96" REF="103">
with loud cries: The animals, alarmed by the noi&s;e, fly before the hunters, and plunge into the lake, where they are killed by the people in the canoes with lances and clubs.&mdash;Another method requires a greater degree of pre|paration and art:&mdash;The hunters inclo&s;e a large &s;pace with &s;takes and branches of trees, forming two &s;ides of a tri|angle; the bottom opens into a &s;econd inclo&s;ure, which is fa&s;t on all &s;ides: At the opening are hung numbers of &s;nares, made of the &s;lips of raw hides. They a&s;&s;emble, as before, in great troops; and, with all kinds of hideous noi&s;es, drive into the inclo&s;ure not only the Moo&s;e, but various other kinds of Deer with which that country abounds. Some, in forcing their way through the nar|row pa&s;s, are caught in the &s;nares by the neck or horns; whil&s;t tho&s;e which e&s;cape the&s;e, meet their fate from the arrows of the hunters, directed at them from all quar|ters. &mdash;They are likewi&s;e frequently killed with the gun. When they are fir&s;t di&s;covered, they &s;quat with their hind parts, and make water; at which in&s;tant the &s;port&s;|man fires. If he mi&s;s, the Moo&s;e &s;ets off in a mo&s;t rapid trot, making, like the Rein-deer, a prodigious rattling with its hoofs, and running twenty or thirty miles before it &s;tops or takes the water. The u&s;ual time for this di|ver&s;ion is in winter. The animal can run with ea&s;e up|on the firm &s;urface of the &s;now; but the hunters avoid entering on the cha&s;e till the heat of the &s;un is &s;trong enough to melt the frozen cru&s;t with which it is covered, and render it &s;oft enough to impede the flight of the Moo&s;e, which &s;inks up to the &s;houlders, flounders, and gets on with great difficulty. The &s;port&s;man pur&s;ues in his broad-rackets or &s;now-&s;hoes, and makes a ready prey of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed animal.</P>

<P>The female is le&s;s than the male, and has no horns. They are in &s;ea&s;on in the autumn, and bring forth in April, &s;ometimes one, but generally two young ones at a time, which arrive at their full growth in &s;ix years.</P>

</FIGURE> THE REIN-DEER.</HEAD>
<P>This extraordinary animal is a native of the icy re|gions of the North; where, by a wi&s;e and bountiful di&s;|pen&s;ation, which diffu&s;es the common goods of Nature over every part of the habitable globe, it abounds, and is made &s;ub&s;ervient to the wants of a hardy race of men in|habiting the countries near the pole, who would find it
<PB N="98" REF="105">
impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ub&s;i&s;t among their &s;nowy mountains with|out the aid of this mo&s;t u&s;eful creature.</P>
<P>In more temperate regions, men are indebted to the unbounded liberality of Nature for a great variety of va|luable creatures to &s;erve, to nouri&s;h, and to cloath them. To the poor Laplander the Rein-deer alone &s;upplies the place of the Hor&s;e, the Cow, the Sheep, the Goat, &amp;c.; and from it he derives the only comforts that tend to &s;often the &s;everity of his &s;ituation in that mo&s;t inho&s;pita|ble climate.</P>
<P>The Rein-deer of Lapland are of two kinds,&mdash;the wild and the tame: The former are larger, &s;tronger, and more hardy than the latter; for which rea&s;on the tame females, in the proper &s;ea&s;on, are often &s;ent out into the woods, where they meet with wild males, and return home im|pregnated by them. The breed from this mixture is &s;tronger, and better adapted for drawing the &s;ledge, to which the Laplanders accu&s;tom them at an early age.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">

<P>They are yoked to it by a collar; from which a trace is brought under the belly between the legs, and fa&s;tened to the fore part of the &s;ledge. The&s;e carriages are ex|tremely
<PB N="99" REF="106">
light, and covered at the bottom with the &s;kin of the Rein-deer. The per&s;on who &s;its in it guides the animal with a cord fa&s;tened to its horns; he drives it with a goad, and encourages it with his voice. Tho&s;e of the wild breed, though by far the &s;tronge&s;t, often prove refractory; and not only refu&s;e to obey their ma&s;ter, but turn again&s;t him, and &s;trike &s;o furiou&s;ly with their feet, that his only re&s;ource is to cover him&s;elf with his &s;ledge, upon which the enraged animal vents its fury. The tame animal, on the contrary, is patient, active, and willing.&mdash;When hard pu&s;hed, the Rein-deer will trot the di&s;tance of &s;ixty miles without &s;topping; but in &s;uch ex|ertions, the poor obedient creature fatigues it&s;elf &s;o ex|ceedingly, that its ma&s;ter is frequently obliged to kill it immediately, to prevent a lingering death that would en|&s;ue. In general, they can go about thirty miles without &s;topping, and that without any great or dangerous efforts.</P>
<P>This mode of travelling can be performed only in the winter &s;ea&s;on, when the face of the country is covered with &s;now; and, although the conveyance is &s;peedy, it is inconvenient, dangerous, and trouble&s;ome.</P>
<P>As the Rein-deer con&s;titutes the &s;ole riches of the Laplander, it may well be &s;uppo&s;ed that a con&s;tant at|tention to pre&s;erve and &s;ecure it forms the chief employ|ment of his life. It is no uncommon thing for one per|&s;on to po&s;&s;e&s;s above five hundred in a &s;ingle herd.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;ummer appears, which forms but a &s;hort interval from the mo&s;t piercing cold, the Laplander, who had fed his Rein-deer upon the lower grounds during the winter, drives them up to the mountains, leaving the woody country and the low pa&s;tures, which at that &s;ea|&s;on are in a &s;tate truly deplorable: Myriads of in&s;ects,
<PB N="100" REF="107">
bred by the heat of the &s;un in the woods and fens with which this country abounds, are all upon the wing; the whole atmo&s;phere &s;warms with life; every place and eve|ry creature is infe&s;ted; the natives are obliged to cover their faces with a mixture of pitch and milk, to &s;hield them from the&s;e minute invaders, which are drawn in with the breath, and enter the no&s;trils, and even the eyes; but they are chiefly enemies to the Rein-deer: The horns of that animal being then tender, and covered with a &s;kin, which renders them extremely &s;en&s;itive, a cloud of the&s;e in&s;ects &s;ettle upon them, and drive the poor animal almo&s;t to di&s;traction. In this extremity, there is no re&s;ource but flight. The herd&s;men drive their flocks from the plains to the &s;ummits of the mountains, whither the foe cannot follow them. There they will continue the whole day, with little or no food, rather than venture down into the lower parts, where they have no defence again&s;t their uncea&s;ing per&s;ecutors.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the gnat, the gadfly is a common pe&s;t to the&s;e animals. In the autumn, this in&s;ect depo&s;its its eggs in their &s;kin, where the worms burrow, and wound it in &s;e|veral places, and often prove fatal to the poor animal. The moment a &s;ingle fly is &s;een, the whole herd is in motion: They know their enemy, and endeavour to a|void it, by to&s;&s;ing up their heads, and running among each other; but all this too often proves ineffectual.</P>
<P>Every morning and evening during the &s;ummer, the herd&s;man returns to the cottage with his deer to be milk|ed, where a large fire of mo&s;s is prepared, for the pur|po&s;e of filling the place with &s;moke, to drive off the gnats, and keep the Deer quiet whil&s;t milking.&mdash;The quantity of milk given by one female in a day is about a
<PB N="101" REF="108">
pint. It is thinner than that of a Cow, but &s;weeter and more nouri&s;hing.</P>
<P>The female begins to breed at the age of two years, is in &s;ea&s;on the latter end of September, goes with young eight months, and generally brings forth two at a time. &mdash;The fondne&s;s of the dam for her young is very remark|able. They follow her two or three years, but do not acquire their full &s;trength until four. It is at this age that they are trained to labour; and they continue &s;er|viceable four or five years. They never live above fif|teen or &s;ixteen years.&mdash;At eight or nine years old, the Laplanders kill them for their &s;kins and their fle&s;h. Of the former they make garments, which are warm, and cover them from head to foot; they al&s;o &s;erve them for beds: They &s;pread them on each &s;ide of the fire upon the leaves of trees, and in this manner lie both &s;oft and warm. The latter affords a con&s;tant &s;upply of good and whole&s;ome food, which in the winter, when all other kinds of provi&s;ions fail, is their chief &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The tongue of the Rein-deer is con&s;idered as a great delica|cy; and when dried, great numbers of them are &s;old in|to other countries. The &s;inews &s;erve for thread, with which the Laplanders make their cloaths, &s;hoes, and other nece&s;&s;aries; and, when covered with the hair, &s;erve them for ropes.</P>
<P>Innumerable are the u&s;es, the comforts, and advan|tages, which the poor inhabitants of this dreary climate derive from this animal. We cannot &s;um them up bet|ter than in the beautiful language of the poet:&mdash;

<P>The horns of the Rein-deer are large and &s;lender, bending forward; with brow antlers, which are broad and palmated. A pair in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion are in length two feet eight inches, and from tip to tip two feet five inches; they weigh nine pounds: The projecting brow antler is fourteen inches long, one foot broad, and &s;er|rated at the end: It &s;hould &s;eem, both from its &s;ituation and form, an excellent in&s;trument to remove the &s;now, under which its favourite mo&s;s lies. Both &s;exes have horns: Tho&s;e of the female are le&s;s, and have fewer branches.</P>
<P>We are happy in being able to give an accurate repre|&s;entation of this &s;ingular creature. The drawing was taken from one in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sir H. G. Liddell, Bart. which he brought over from Lapland, with four others, in 1786. The height at the &s;houlder was three feet three inches: The hair on the body was of a dark-brown colour; and on the neck, brown mixed with white: A large tuft of hair, of a dirty-white colour, hung down from the throat, near its che&s;t; and it had a large white &s;pot on the in&s;ide of each hind leg, clo&s;e by the joint: Its head was long and fine; and round each eye was a large black &s;pace: Its horns were cover|ed with a fine down like velvet. The hoofs of this ani|mal are large, broad, and deeply cloven: They &s;pread cut to a great breadth on the ground; and, when the animal is in motion, make a crackling noi&s;e, by being drawn up forcibly together.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="110">Not many attempts have been made to draw the Rein-deer from its native mountains, and tran&s;port it to milder climes; and of the&s;e, few have &s;ucceeded. Na|turali&s;ts from thence have concluded, that it cannot exi&s;t but amid&s;t ice and &s;now. M. Buffon regrets the impo&s;&s;i|bility of procuring the animal alive; and &s;ays, that when tran&s;ported to another climate it &s;oon dies. M. Regnard mentions &s;ome that were brought to Dantzick; where, being unable to endure the heat of the climate, they all peri&s;hed. Queen Chri&s;tina of Sweden procured five and twenty, which &s;he purpo&s;ed &s;ending to Oliver Cromwell: They were brought as far as Stockholm; but the Lap|landers who attended them refu&s;ing to come to England, fifteen of the number were killed by the wolves, and the remaining ten did not long &s;urvive, the climate being con&s;idered as too warm.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e brought over by Sir H. G. Liddell, five more were added the year following: They produced young ones, and gave promi&s;ing hopes of thriving in this coun|try; but, by accident or mi&s;management, the &s;tock is now (in 1789) reduced to a &s;ingle female with young. The di&s;order of which mo&s;t of them died was &s;imilar to what is called the <HI>rot</HI> in Sheep, and is generally attri|buted to the too great richne&s;s of the gra&s;s whereon they fed. Nor can we wonder at the failure of this &s;pirited enterprize, when we con&s;ider that it is the &s;ole employ|ment of the Laplander to attend and herd his Rein-deer, to drive them in the &s;ummer time to the &s;ummits of the mountains, to the &s;ides of clear lakes and &s;treams, and to lead them where they can find the mo&s;t proper food: Want of knowledge or attention to minute particulars is &s;ufficient to overturn the be&s;t-laid plans.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="111">There is, however, little doubt but this animal will live without the Lapland <HI>lichen;</HI> to which, perhaps, it only hath recour&s;e, becau&s;e there is in tho&s;e latitudes no other &s;u&s;tenance during the winter. It is al&s;o in Eng|land free from its mortal enemy&mdash;the gadfly. But as the de&s;ire of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing this animal has hitherto been ex|cited only by curio&s;ity, it is not likely that much atten|tion will be paid to it in a country like this, abounding with &s;uch variety of u&s;eful quadrupeds.</P>
<P>The Rein-deer is wild in America, where it is called the <HI>Caribou:</HI> It is found in Spitzbergen and Greenland; and is very common in the mo&s;t northern parts of Eu|rope, and in A&s;ia as far as Kamt&s;chatka, where &s;ome of the riche&s;t of the natives keep herds of ten or twenty thou&s;and in number.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of Hud&s;on's Bay, there are great herds of wild Rein-deer: Columns of eight or ten thou|&s;and are &s;een annually pa&s;&s;ing from North to South in the months of March and April. In that &s;ea&s;on, the mu&s;katoes are very trouble&s;ome, and oblige them to quit the woods, and &s;eek refre&s;hment on the &s;hore and open country.&mdash;Great numbers of bea&s;ts of prey follow the herds: The wolves &s;ingle out the &s;tragglers, detach them from the flock, and hunt them down; the foxes attend at a di&s;tance to pick up the offals left by the for|mer. &mdash;In autumn, the Deer, with the fawns bred during the &s;ummer, remigrate northward.</P>

</FIGURE> THE STAG, OR RED DEER,</HEAD>
<P>is the mo&s;t beautiful animal of the Deer kind. The ele|gance of his form, the lightne&s;s of his motions, the flex|ibility of his limbs, his bold, branching horns, which are annually renewed, his grandeur, &s;trength, and &s;wiftne&s;s, give him a decided pre-eminence over every other inha|bitant of the fore&s;t.</P>
<P>The age of the Stag is known by its horns:&mdash;The fir&s;t year exhibits only a &s;hort protuberance, which is covered with a hairy &s;kin; the next year the horns are &s;traight and &s;ingle; the third year produces two antlers; the
<PB N="106" REF="113">
fourth three; the fifth four; and when arrived at the &s;ixth year, the antlers amount to &s;ix or &s;even on each &s;ide; but the number is not always certain.</P>
<P>The Stag begins to &s;hed his horns the latter end of February, or the beginning of March. Soon after the old horn is fallen off, a &s;oft tumour begins to appear, which is &s;oon covered with a down like velvet: This tu|mour every day buds forth like the graft of a tree; and, ri&s;ing by degrees, &s;hoots out the antlers on each &s;ide. The &s;kin continues to cover it for &s;ome time, and is fur|ni&s;hed with blood-ve&s;&s;els, which &s;upply the growing horns with nouri&s;hment, and occa&s;ion the furrows ob|&s;ervable in them when that covering is &s;tript off: The impre&s;&s;ion is deeper at the bottom, where the ve&s;&s;els are larger; and dimini&s;hes towards the point, where they are as &s;mooth and &s;olid as ivory. When the horns are at their full growth, they acquire &s;trength and &s;olidity; and the velvet covering or &s;kin, with its blood-ve&s;&s;els, dries up, and begins to fall off; which the animal en|deavours to ha&s;ten, by rubbing its antlers again&s;t the trees; and in this manner the whole head gradually ac|quires its compleat hardne&s;s, expan&s;ion, and beauty.</P>
<P>Soon after the Stags have poli&s;hed their horns, which is not compleated till July or Augu&s;t, they quit the thickets, and return to the fore&s;ts: They cry with a loud and tremulous note; and fly from place to place, in &s;earch of the females, with extreme ardour: Their necks &s;well; they &s;trike with their horns again&s;t trees and other ob&s;tacles, and become extremely furious.</P>
<P>At this &s;ea&s;on, when two Stags meet, their conte&s;ts are often de&s;perate, and terminate in the defeat or flight of one of them; while the other remains in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="107" REF="114">
his mi&s;tre&s;s and the field, till another rival approaches, that he is al&s;o obliged to attack and repel.</P>
<P>During this time, which u&s;ually la&s;ts about three weeks, the Stag is frequently &s;een by the &s;ides of rivers and pools of water, where he can quench his thir&s;t, as well as cool his ardour. He &s;wims with great ea&s;e and &s;trength; and, it is &s;aid, will even venture out to &s;ea, al|lured by the Hinds, and &s;wim from one i&s;land to another, though at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The Hinds go with young eight months and a few days; and &s;eldom produce more than one young, called a <HI>fawn.</HI> They bring forth in May, or the beginning of June; and conceal their young with great care in the mo&s;t ob&s;cure retreats. They will even expo&s;e them&s;elves to the fury of the hounds, and &s;uffer all the terrors of the cha&s;e, in order to draw off the Dogs from their hiding place. The Hind is al&s;o very bold in the protec|tion of her offspring, and defends it with great courage again&s;t her numerous and rapacious enemies: The Wild Cat, the Dog, and even the Wolf, are frequently obliged to give way to her upon the&s;e occa&s;ions. But what ap|pears to be &s;trangely unnatural, the Stag him&s;elf is fre|quently one of her mo&s;t dangerous foes, and would de|&s;troy the young fawn, if not prevented by the maternal care of the Hind in concealing from his ob&s;ervation the place of its retreat.</P>
<P>The calf never quits the dam during the whole &s;um|mer; and in winter, the Stags and Hinds of all ages keep together in herds, which are more or le&s;s numerous, according to the mildne&s;s or rigour of the &s;ea&s;on. They &s;eparate in the &s;pring; the Hinds retire to bring forth, while none but the young ones remain together.&mdash;Stags
<PB N="108" REF="115">
are gregarious animals, and fond of grazing in compa|ny: It is danger or nece&s;&s;ity alone that &s;eparates them.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual colour of the Stag in England is red; in other countries, it is generally brown or yellow. His eye is peculiarly beautiful, &s;oft, and &s;parkling; his hear|ing is quick; and his &s;en&s;e of &s;melling acute. When li&s;tening, he rai&s;es his head, erects his ears, and &s;eems attentive to every noi&s;e, which he can hear at a great di&s;tance. When he approaches a thicket, he &s;tops to look round him on all &s;ides, and attentively &s;urveys eve|ry object near him: If the cunning animal perceive no|thing to alarm him, he moves &s;lowly forward; but, on the lea&s;t appearance of danger, he flies off with the ra|pidity of the wind. He appears to li&s;ten with great tran|quillity and delight to the &s;ound of the &s;hepherd's pipe, which the hunters &s;ometimes make u&s;e of to allure the poor animal to his de&s;truction.</P>
<P>The Stag eats &s;lowly, and is nice in the choice of his pa&s;ture. When his &s;tomach is full, he lies down to chew the cud at lei&s;ure. This, however, &s;eems to be attended with greater exertions than in the Ox or the Sheep; for the gra&s;s is not returned from the fir&s;t &s;to|mach without violent &s;training, owing to the great length of his neck, and the narrowne&s;s of the pa&s;&s;age. This ef|fort is made by a kind of hiccup, which continues during the time of his ruminating.</P>
<P>The voice of the Stag is &s;tronger and more quivering as he advances in age; in the rutting &s;ea&s;on, it is even terrible: That of the Hind is not &s;o loud, and is &s;el|dom heard but when excited by apprehen&s;ion for her&s;elf or her young.</P>
<P>The Stag has been &s;aid to be an uncommonly long-lived
<PB N="109" REF="116">
animal; but later ob&s;ervations have fully confuted this unfounded opinion. It is a generally received max|im, that animals live &s;even times the number of years that bring them to perfection: Thus the Stag being five or &s;ix years in arriving at maturity, lives &s;even times that number, or from thirty-five to forty years.</P>
<P>The following fact, recorded in hi&s;tory, will &s;erve to &s;hew that the Stag is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an extraordinary &s;hare of courage when his per&s;onal &s;afety is concerned:&mdash;Some years ago, William, Duke of Cumberland, cau&s;ed a Ti|ger and a Stag to be inclo&s;ed in the &s;ame area; and the Stag made &s;o bold a defence, that the Tiger was at length obliged to give up.</P>
<P>The hunting of the Stag has been held in all ages as a diver&s;ion of the noble&s;t kind; and former times bear wit|ne&s;s of the great exploits performed on the&s;e occa&s;ions. In our i&s;land, large tracts of land were &s;et apart for this purpo&s;e; villages and &s;acred edifices were wantonly thrown down, and converted into one wide wa&s;te, that the tyrant of the day might have room to pur&s;ue his fa|vourite diver&s;ion. In the time of William Rufus and Henry the Fir&s;t, it was le&s;s criminal to de&s;troy one of the human &s;pecies than a bea&s;t of cha&s;e. Happily for us, the&s;e wide-extended &s;cenes of de&s;olation and oppre&s;&s;ion have been gradually contracted; u&s;eful arts, agriculture, and commerce, have exten&s;ively &s;pread them&s;elves over the naked land; and the&s;e &s;uperior bea&s;ts of the cha&s;e have given way to other animals more u&s;eful to the com|munity.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent cultivated &s;tate of this country, there|fore, the Stag is almo&s;t unknown in its wild &s;tate: The few that remain are kept in parks among the Fallow-deer,
<PB N="110" REF="117">
and di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>Red Deer.</HI> Its viciou&s;ne&s;s during the rutting &s;ea&s;on, and the badne&s;s of its fle&s;h, which is poor and ill-flavoured, have occa&s;ioned almo&s;t the extinction of the &s;pecies. Some few are yet to be found in the fore&s;ts that border on Cornwall and Devon&s;hire, on mo&s;t of the large mountains of Ireland, and in the Highlands of Scotland, where Dr John&s;on de|&s;cribes them as not exceeding the Fallow-deer in &s;ize, and their fle&s;h of equal flavour. The Red Deer of this kingdom are nearly of the &s;ame &s;ize and colour, without much variety: In other parts of the world, they differ in form and &s;ize, as well as in their horns and the colour of their bodies.</P>

<P>is an inhabitant of tho&s;e immen&s;e plains of India, water|ed by the river Ganges.&mdash;M. Buffon con&s;iders it as a va|riety or &s;hade between the Stag and the Fallow-deer. It is of the &s;ize of the latter; but its horns are round, like tho&s;e of the Stag; and it has no brow antlers. His whole body is marked with white &s;pots, elegantly di&s;|po&s;ed, and di&s;tinct from each other; the belly, in&s;ide of the thighs, and legs, are white; along the back there are two rows of &s;pots, parallel to each other; tho&s;e on the other parts of the body are irregular; the head and neck are grey; and the tail, which is red above, and white beneath, is as long as that of the Fallow-deer.</P>
<P>The continent of America abounds with Stags, and other animals of the Deer kind, in great variety. In &s;ome parts of that va&s;t country, the inhabitants have do|me&s;ticated
<PB N="112" REF="119">
them, and live chiefly upon the milk and chee&s;e with which they &s;upply them.</P>
<P>Thus we find, that the &s;ame animal which in &s;ome parts contributes only to the amu&s;ement of man, may in others be brought to &s;upply his nece&s;&s;ities. The &s;tores of Nature are various and abundant: It is indu&s;try alone that draws them out to &s;upply our wants, and contribute to our comforts.</P>

<HEAD><FIGURE>
</FIGURE> THE FALLOW-DEER.</HEAD>
<P>The principal difference between the Stag and the Fal|low-deer &s;eems to be in their &s;ize, and in the form of their horns,&mdash;the latter being much &s;maller than the for|mer; and its horns, in&s;tead of being round like tho&s;e of the Stag, are broad and palmated, and better garni&s;hed with antlers; and when the horns are very &s;trong, they
<PB N="113" REF="120">
are &s;ometimes terminated by &s;mall palms: The tail is al|&s;o much longer than that of the Stag, and its hair is brighter: In other re&s;pects, they nearly re&s;emble each other.</P>
<P>The horns of the Fallow-deer are &s;hed annually, like tho&s;e of the Stag; but they fall off later, and are renew|ed nearly at the &s;ame time. Their rutting &s;ea&s;on arrives fifteen days or three weeks after that of the Stag. The males then bellow frequently, but with a low and inter|rupted voice. They are not &s;o furious at this &s;ea&s;on as the Stag, nor exhau&s;t them&s;elves by any uncommon ar|dour. They never leave their pa&s;ture in que&s;t of the fe|males; but generally fight with each other, till one buck becomes ma&s;ter of the field.</P>
<P>They a&s;&s;ociate in herds, which &s;ometimes divide into two parties, and maintain ob&s;tinate battles for the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome favourite part of the park: Each party has its leader, which is always the olde&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t of the flock. In this manner they attack in regular order of battle; they fight with courage, and mutually &s;upport each other; they retire, they rally, and &s;eldom give up after one defeat. The combat is frequently renewed for &s;everal days together, till, after &s;everal defeats, the weak|er party is obliged to give way, and leave the conquerors in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the object of their contention.</P>
<P>The Fallow-deer is ea&s;ily tamed, feeds upon a variety of things which the Stag refu&s;es, and pre&s;erves its condi|tion nearly the &s;ame through the whole year, although its fle&s;h is e&s;teemed much finer at particular &s;ea&s;ons.</P>
<P>They are capable of procreation in their &s;econd year; and, like the Stag, are fond of variety.&mdash;The female goes with young eight months; and produces one, &s;ometimes
<PB N="114" REF="121">
two, and rarely three, at a time. They arrive at per|fection at the age of three years, and live till about twen|ty.</P>
<P>We have in England two varieties of the Fallow-deer, which are &s;aid to be of foreign origin: The beautiful &s;potted kind, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been brought from Ben|gal; and the deep-brown &s;ort, now common in this country. The&s;e la&s;t were introduced by king James the Fir&s;t out of Norway; where having ob&s;erved their hardi|ne&s;s in bearing the cold of that &s;evere climate, he brought &s;ome of them into Scotland, and from thence tran&s;ported them into his cha&s;es of Enfield and Epping. Since that time, they have multiplied exceedingly in many parts of this kingdom, which is now become famous for veni&s;on of &s;uperior fatne&s;s and flavour to that of any other coun|try in the world.</P>
<P>The Fallow-deer, with &s;ome variation, is found in al|mo&s;t every country of Europe. Tho&s;e of Spain are as large as Stags, but darker; their necks are al&s;o more &s;lender; and their tails, which are longer than tho&s;e of ours, are black above, and white beneath.</P>
<P>In Guiana, (a country of South-America) according to Labat, there are Deer without horns, &s;maller than tho&s;e of Europe, but re&s;embling them in every other par|ticular. They are very lively, light, and exce&s;&s;ively ti|mid; of a reddi&s;h colour; with &s;harp, piercing eyes, and &s;hort tails. When pur&s;ued, they fly into places of dif|ficult acce&s;s. The natives frequently &s;tand and watch for them in narrow paths, and as &s;oon as the game ap|pears within reach, &s;hoot them unperceived. Their fle&s;h is con&s;idered as a great delicacy; and the hunter is well rewarded for his trouble.</P>

</FIGURE> THE ROE-BUCK</HEAD>
<P>was formerly common in many parts of England and Wales; but at pre&s;ent is only to be found in the High-lands of Scotland.</P>
<P>The Roe is the &s;malle&s;t of all the Deer kind, being only three feet four inches long, and &s;omewhat more than two feet in height. The horns are from eight to nine inches long, upright, round, and divided into three branches; the body is covered with long hair; the lower part of each hair is a&s;h colour, near the end is a narrow bar of black, and the point is yellow; the hairs on the face are black, tipped with a&s;h colour; the ears are long, their in&s;ides of a pale-yellow, and covered with long hair; the &s;paces bordering on the eyes and mouth are black; the che&s;t, belly, legs, and the in&s;ide of the thighs,
<PB N="116" REF="123">
are of a yellowi&s;h-white; the rump is of a pure white; and the tail very &s;hort.</P>
<P>The form of the Roe-buck is elegant; and its motions light and ea&s;y. It bounds &s;eemingly without effort, and runs with great &s;wiftne&s;s. When hunted, it endeavours to elude its pur&s;uers by the mo&s;t &s;ubtle artifices: It re|peatedly returns upon its former &s;teps, till, by various windings, it has entirely confounded the &s;cent. The cunning animal then, by a &s;udden &s;pring, bounds to one &s;ide, and lying clo&s;e down upon its belly, permits the hounds to pa&s;s by without offering to &s;tir.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals do not keep together in herds like other Deer, but live in &s;eparate families: The fire, the dam, and the young ones, a&s;&s;ociate together, and &s;eldom mix with others.</P>
<P>Their rutting &s;ea&s;on continues but fifteen days&mdash;from the latter end of October till about the middle of No|vember. During this period, they will not &s;uffer the fawns to remain with them: The Buck obliges them to retire, in order that the dam and her &s;ucceeding progeny may remain undi&s;turbed.&mdash;The female goes with young five months and a half, and brings forth about the end of April, or beginning of May. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, &s;he &s;eparates from the male, and conceals her&s;elf in the thicke&s;t and mo&s;t retired part of the woods. She gene|rally produces two fawns at a time, &s;ometimes three. In ten or twelve days, the&s;e are able to follow their dam. When threatened with danger, &s;he hides them in a thicket, and to pre&s;erve them, offers her&s;elf to be cha&s;ed. Notwith&s;tanding her care, &s;he is frequently robbed of her young: Numbers of fawns are found out and taken alive by the pea&s;ants; and many more are worried by Dogs,
<PB N="117" REF="124">
Foxes, and other carnivorous animals. By the&s;e conti|nual depredations, this beautiful creature is daily becom|ing more &s;carce; and in many countries where once it was common, the race is now wholly extinct.</P>
<P>When about eight or nine months old, their horns be|gin to appear in the form of two knobs. The fir&s;t year they are without antlers. They &s;hed their horns the lat|ter end of autumn, and renew them in the winter; in which they differ from the Stag, who&s;e horns fall off in the &s;pring, and are renewed in &s;ummer.&mdash;The life of the Roe-buck &s;eldom exceeds twelve or fifteen years.</P>
<P>They are very delicate in the choice of their food, and require a large tract of country, &s;uited to the wildne&s;s of their nature, which can never be thoroughly &s;ubdued. No arts can teach them to be familiar with their keeper, nor in any degree attached to him. They are ea&s;ily ter|rified; and in their attempts to e&s;cape, will run with &s;uch force again&s;t the walls of their inclo&s;ure, as &s;ome|times to di&s;able them&s;elves. They are likewi&s;e &s;ubject to capricious fits of fiercene&s;s, and on the&s;e occa&s;ions will &s;trike furiou&s;ly with their horns and feet at the object of their di&s;like.</P>
<P>Some years ago, one of the&s;e animals, after being hunted out of Scotland through Cumberland and various parts of the North of England, at la&s;t took refuge in the woody rece&s;&s;es bordering upon the banks of the Tyne, between Prudhoe Ca&s;tle and Wylam. It was frequently &s;een and hunted; but no dogs were equal to its &s;peed: It frequently cro&s;&s;ed the river; and either by &s;wiftne&s;s or artifice, eluded all its pur&s;uers. It happened, during the rigour of a &s;evere winter, that being pur&s;ued, it cro&s;&s;ed the river upon the ice with &s;ome difficulty; and being
<PB N="118" REF="125">
much &s;trained by its violent exertions, was taken alive. It was kept for &s;ome weeks in the hou&s;e; and being again turned out, all its cunning and activity were gone: It &s;eemed to have forgotten the places of its former re|treat; and after running &s;ome time, it lay down in the mid&s;t of a brook, where it was killed by the dogs.</P>
<P>The fle&s;h of the Roe-buck is fine and well ta&s;ted: That of the male, after the age of two years, is hard; the fle&s;h of the females, though farther advanced in years, is more tender: When very young, it is loo&s;e and &s;oft; but at the age of eighteen months, is in its highe&s;t &s;tate of perfection.</P>
<P>In America, this animal is much more common than in Europe.&mdash;In Loui&s;iana, it is very large. The inhabi|tants live chiefly upon its fle&s;h, which is good and well flavoured.</P>

<P>POSSESSES the various qualities of the Hor&s;e, the Cow, and the Sheep; and is to the Arabian, in a great mea&s;ure, what tho&s;e u&s;eful creatures are to us. Its milk is rich and nouri&s;hing; and being mixed with wa|ter, makes a whole&s;ome and refre&s;hing beverage, much u&s;ed by the Arabs in their journies. The fle&s;h of young Camels is al&s;o an excellent and whole&s;ome food. Their hair or &s;leece, which falls off entirely in the &s;pring, is &s;uperior to that of any other dome&s;tic animal, and is made into very fine &s;tuffs for cloaths, coverings, tents, and other furniture.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his Camel, the Arabian has nothing either to want or to fear: In one day, he can perform a jour|ney of fifty leagues into the de&s;ert, where he is &s;afe from every enemy: For, without the aid of this u&s;eful animal, no per&s;on could pur&s;ue him amid&s;t &s;andy de&s;erts, where there is neither verdure to refre&s;h, nor &s;hade to &s;helter&mdash;
<PB N="120" REF="127">
where nothing pre&s;ents it&s;elf to the eye but one uniform void, naked and &s;olitary.</P>
<P>The Arabian regards the Camel as the mo&s;t precious gift of Heaven; by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of which he is enabled to &s;ub&s;i&s;t in tho&s;e frightful intervals of Nature, which &s;erve him for an a&s;ylum, and &s;ecure his independence. But it is not to the plundering Arab alone that the &s;er|vices of this u&s;eful quadruped are confined,&mdash;in Turkey, Per&s;ia, Barbary, and Egypt, every article of merchandi&s;e is carried by Camels. Merchants and travellers unite to|gether, and form them&s;elves into numerous bodies, called caravans, to prevent the in&s;ults of the Arabs. One of the&s;e caravans frequently con&s;i&s;ts of many thou&s;ands, the Camels being always more numerous than the men. Each Camel is loaded in proportion to his &s;trength. At the command of their conductor, they lie down on their belly, with their legs folded under them, and in this po&s;|ture receive their burden: As &s;oon as they are loaded, they ri&s;e of their own accord, and will not &s;uffer any greater weight to be impo&s;ed upon them than they can bear with ea&s;e; when overloaded, they &s;et up the mo&s;t piteous cries till part of the burden be taken off. The large Camels generally carry a thou&s;and or twelve hun|dred pounds weight; and the &s;malle&s;t, from &s;ix to &s;even hundred. As the route is often &s;even or eight hundred leagues, their motions and journies are regulated: They walk only, and in that pace travel ten or twelve leagues each day. Every night they are unloaded, and allowed to pa&s;ture upon &s;uch herbage as they can find. Thi&s;tles, nettles, wormwood, and the other hard and prickly ve|getables which the &s;andy de&s;erts of Arabia produce, the Camel often prefers to more delicate herbage: But the
<PB N="121" REF="128">
peculiar and di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic of the Camel is, its faculty of ab&s;taining from water for a greater length of time than any other animal; for which Nature has made a wonderful provi&s;ion, in giving it, be&s;ides the four &s;tomachs which it has in common with other ruminating animals, a fifth bag, &s;erving as a re&s;ervoir for water, where it remains without corrupting or mixing with the other aliments. When the animal is pre&s;&s;ed with thir&s;t, and has occa&s;ion for water to macerate its food while ruminating, he makes part of it pa&s;s into his &s;tomach by a &s;imple contraction of certain mu&s;cles. By this &s;ingular &s;tructure, the Camel can take a prodigious quantity of water at one draught; and is enabled to pa&s;s &s;everal days without drinking: Leo Africanus &s;ays fifteen. They can di&s;cover water by their &s;mell at half a league's di&s;tance; and after a long ab&s;tinence, will ha&s;ten towards it, long before their drivers perceive where it lies. The feet of the Camel are peculiarly adapted to the &s;andy &s;oil on which he treads: On moi&s;t or &s;lippery ground he cannot well &s;upport him&s;elf, his hind legs being apt to &s;pread out &s;o wide, as to endanger his being di&s;abled.</P>
<P>Many attempts have been made to introduce this &s;er|viceable animal into other countries; but as yet none have &s;ucceeded: The race &s;eems to be confined to cer|tain di&s;tricts, where their utility has been known for ages.</P>
<P>Though a native of warm climates, the Camel dreads tho&s;e which are exce&s;&s;ively hot: It can neither &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the burning heat of the torrid zone, nor in the milder air of the temperate. It &s;eems to be an original native of Arabia; for in that country, they are not only more nu|merous, but thrive better than in any other part of the world.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="129">There are two varieties of this animal, which have been di&s;tingui&s;hed previous to all hi&s;torical record: That which is called the <HI>Bactrian Camel,</HI> has two hunches on its back, and is found chiefly in Turkey and the coun|tries of the Levant; while</P>

<P>with only one hunch on its back, is common in Arabia and all the northern parts of Africa, from the Mediterra|nean Sea to the river Niger, and is infinitely more nu|merous, and more generally diffu&s;ed than the Camel: It is al&s;o much &s;wifter, and is therefore generally employed on bu&s;ine&s;s which requires di&s;patch.</P>
<P>In Arabia, they are trained for running matches; and in many places, for carrying couriers, who can go above a hundred miles a day on them, and that for nine or ten days together, over burning de&s;erts uninhabitable by any living creature. They require neither whip nor &s;pur to quicken their pace: but go freely, if gently treated; and
<PB N="123" REF="130">
are much enlivened by &s;inging or the &s;ound of the pipe, which gives them fre&s;h &s;pirits to pur&s;ue their journey.</P>
<P>They are mild and gentle creatures at all times, except when they are in heat: At that period, they are &s;eized with a &s;ort of madne&s;s; they eat little, and will &s;ome|times attempt to bite their ma&s;ters; &s;o that it is not &s;afe to approach them.</P>
<P>The Camel arrives at its full &s;trength at the age of &s;ix years, and lives forty or fifty.&mdash;The females are not u&s;u|ally put to labour; but are allowed to pa&s;ture and breed at full liberty. Their time of ge&s;tation is near twelve months; and they generally bring forth one at a birth.</P>

<HEAD>THE LAMA</HEAD>
<P>is the Camel of Peru and Chili; and before the conque&s;t of tho&s;e countries by the Spaniards, was the only bea&s;t of burden known to the Indians.&mdash;Its di&s;po&s;ition is mild, gentle, and tractable.</P>
<P>Before the introduction of Mules, the&s;e animals were u&s;ed by the natives to plow the land, and now &s;erve to carry burdens. They march &s;lowly, and &s;eldom accom|pli&s;h journies of more than four or five leagues a day; but what they want in &s;peed is made up by per&s;everance and indu&s;try. They travel long journies in countries im|pa&s;&s;able to mo&s;t other animals. They are very &s;ure-foot|ed, and are much employed in tran&s;porting the rich ores dug out of the mines of Poto&s;i over the rugged hills and narrow paths of the Andes. Bolivar remarks, that in his time three hundred thou&s;and of the&s;e animals were con|&s;tantly employed in this work. They lie down to be loaded; and when weary, no blows can excite them to quicken their pace.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="131">They neither defend them&s;elves with their feet nor their teeth: When angry, they have no other method of revenging injuries but by &s;pitting. They can throw out their &s;aliva to the di&s;tance of ten paces; and if it fall on the &s;kin, it rai&s;es an itching, accompanied with a &s;light inflammation.&mdash;Their fle&s;h is eaten, and &s;aid to be as good as mutton.</P>
<P>Like the Camel, they have the faculty of ab&s;taining long from water (&s;ometimes four or five days); and like that animal's, their food is coar&s;e and trifling. They are neither allowed corn nor hay; green herbage, of which they eat very moderately, being &s;ufficient for their nou|ri&s;hment.</P>
<P>The wild Lamas, called <HI>Guanacos,</HI> are &s;tronger and more active than the dome&s;tic kind. They live in herds, and inhabit the highe&s;t regions of the Cordelieres. They run with great &s;wiftne&s;s in places of difficult acce&s;s, where Dogs cannot ea&s;ily follow them. The mo&s;t u&s;ual way of killing them is with the gun. They are hunted for the &s;ake of their fle&s;h and their hair: Of the latter the Indians make cloth.</P>
<P>The Lamas vary in colour: Some of them are white, others black, and others of a mixed colour&mdash;white, grey, and ru&s;&s;et, di&s;per&s;ed in &s;pots. In &s;hape, they re&s;emble the Camel, without the dor&s;al hunch. This animal has a well-&s;haped head, rather &s;mall, and has &s;ome re&s;em|blance to that of the Goat and Sheep; fine black eyes; and a long neck, bending much, and very protuberant near its junction with the body: Its ears are four inches long: Its feet are cloven like tho&s;e of the Ox; they are armed behind with a &s;pur, by which the animal is ena|bled to &s;upport it&s;elf on rugged and difficult ground.

The height of the Lama is about four feet; and its length, from the neck to the tail, &s;ix feet.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THE PACOS</HEAD>
<P>very much re&s;embles the Lama in figure, but is much &s;maller. Its body is covered with very fine long wool, of the colour of dried ro&s;es, or a dull purple; the belly is white. They live in va&s;t herds, and inhabit the mo&s;t elevated parts of the highe&s;t mountains, where they en|dure the utmo&s;t rigour of fro&s;t and &s;now. They are ex|ceedingly &s;wift; and &s;o timid, that it is very difficult to come near them.</P>
<P>The manner of taking them is &s;ingular: The Indians tie cords, with &s;mall pieces of wool or cloth hanging from them, acro&s;s the narrow pa&s;&s;es of the mountains, about three or four feet from the ground: They then drive a herd of the&s;e animals towards them; and they are &s;o terrified by the flutter of the rags, that they dare not pa&s;s; but huddle together, and &s;uffer them&s;elves to be killed in great numbers.&mdash;Their wool is a valuable article of commerce; and is made into gloves, &s;tockings, bed-cloaths, carpets, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Pacos are dome&s;ticated; and like the Lamas, are employed in carrying burdens; but cannot bear more than from fifty to &s;eventy-five pounds; and are &s;till more &s;ubject to capricious fits of ob&s;tinacy. When once they lie down with their load, no blows can provoke them to ri&s;e.</P>
<P>The great advantages to be derived from the wool of the&s;e creatures, induced the Spaniards to attempt their introduction into Europe: Some of them were brought over to Spain; but by not &s;ufficiently attending to the
<PB N="126" REF="133">

<P>WHICH is the original of all the varieties to be found in this creature, is much &s;maller than tho&s;e of the dome&s;tic kind; and does not, like them, va|ry in colour, but is invariably of a brinded or dark-grey, inclining to black. His &s;nout is longer than that of the tame Hog; and his ears are &s;hort, round, and black. He is armed with formidable tu&s;ks in each jaw, which &s;erve him for the double purpo&s;e of annoying his enemy, or procuring his food, which is chiefly roots and vegeta|bles: Some of their tu&s;ks are almo&s;t a foot long: Tho&s;e in the upper jaw bend upwards in a circular form, and are exceedingly &s;harp at the points; tho&s;e of the un|der jaw are always mo&s;t to be dreaded; for with them the animal defends him&s;elf, and frequently gives mortal wounds.</P>
<P>Wild Boars are not gregarious; but while young, live together in families, and frequently unite their forces

again&s;t the wolves, or other bea&s;ts of prey. When likely to be attacked, they call to each other with a very loud and fierce note: The &s;tronge&s;t face the danger, and form them&s;elves into a ring, the weake&s;t falling into the cen|tre. In this po&s;ition few bea&s;ts dare venture to engage them; but leave them to pur&s;ue a le&s;s dangerous cha&s;e. &mdash;When the Wild Boar is arrived at a &s;tate of maturity, he walks the fore&s;t alone and fearle&s;s. At that time he dreads no &s;ingle foe; nor will he turn out of his way even for man him&s;elf. He offends no animal; at the &s;ame time he is furni&s;hed with arms which render him a terror to the fierce&s;t.</P>
<P>The hunting of the Wild Boar is a dangerous but com|mon amu&s;ement of the great in tho&s;e countries where it is to be found. The Dogs chiefly u&s;ed for this &s;port are of a &s;low and heavy kind. When the Boar is rou&s;ed, he goes &s;lowly forward, not much afraid, nor very far be|fore his pur&s;uers. He frequently turns round, &s;tops till the hounds come up, and offers to attack them: After keeping each other at bay for a while, the Boar again goes &s;lowly forward, and the Dogs renew the pur&s;uit. In this manner the cha&s;e is continued till the Boar is quite tired, and refu&s;es to go any farther: The Dogs then attempt to clo&s;e in upon him from behind; and in this attack the young ones, being generally the mo&s;t for|ward, frequently lo&s;e their lives: The old &s;ea&s;oned Dogs keep the animal at bay until the hunters come up, who kill him with their &s;pears.</P>

</FIGURE> THE COMMON HOG</HEAD>
<P>is, of all other dome&s;tic quadrupeds, the mo&s;t filthy and impure: Its form is clum&s;y and di&s;gu&s;ting, and its appe|tite gluttonous and exce&s;&s;ive. In no in&s;tance has Nature more con&s;picuou&s;ly &s;hewn her oeconomy than in this race of animals, who&s;e &s;tomachs are fitted to receive nutri|ment from a variety of things that would be otherwi&s;e wa&s;ted: The refu&s;e of the field, the garden, the barn, and the kitchen, affords them a luxurious repa&s;t.</P>
<P>U&s;ele&s;s during life, and only valuable when deprived of it, this animal has &s;ometimes been compared to a mi|&s;er, who&s;e hoarded trea&s;ures are of little value till death has deprived them of their rapacious owner.</P>
<P>The parts of this animal are finely adapted to its mode of living: Nature has given it a form more prone than that of other animals: Its neck is &s;trong and brawny; its &s;nout is long and callous, well calculated for the purpo&s;e of turning up the earth for roots of different kinds, on which it principally feeds (e&s;pecially in its wild &s;tate); and it has a quick &s;en&s;e of &s;melling, by which it is ena|bled
<PB N="130" REF="137">
to trace out its food. It is naturally &s;tupid, inac|tive, and drow&s;y; much inclined to increa&s;e in fat, which is di&s;po&s;ed in a different manner from that of other ani|mals, and forms a thick and regular coat between the fle&s;h and the &s;kin. It is re&s;tle&s;s at a change of weather; and during certain high winds, is &s;o agitated, as to run violently, &s;creaming horribly at the &s;ame time. It ap|pears to fore&s;ee the approach of bad weather, as it pre|viou&s;ly carries &s;traw in its mouth to its &s;ty, prepares a bed, and &s;eems endeavouring to hide it&s;elf from the im|pending &s;torm.</P>
<P>Linnaeus ob&s;erves that the fle&s;h of the Hog is a whole|&s;ome food for tho&s;e that u&s;e much exerci&s;e, but bad for &s;uch as lead a &s;edentary life. It is of univer&s;al u&s;e, and makes in various ways a con&s;tant article in the elegancies of the table. It is of great importance to this country, as a commercial nation; for it takes &s;alt better than any other kind, and con&s;equently is capable of being pre&s;erv|ed longer: It is therefore of great u&s;e in &s;hips, and makes a principal part of the provi&s;ions of the Briti&s;h navy.</P>
<P>The dome&s;tic Sow brings forth twice a year, and pro|duces from ten to twenty at a litter: She goes four months with young, and brings forth in the fifth. At that time &s;he mu&s;t be carefully watched to prevent her from devouring her young: Still greater attention is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to keep off the male, as he would de&s;troy the whole litter.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t numerous breed of Hogs in this i&s;land is that generally known by the name of the <HI>Berk&s;hire Pigs,</HI> now &s;pread through almo&s;t every part of England, and &s;ome parts of Scotland. They are in general of a red|di&s;h-brown colour, with black &s;pots upon them; have
<PB N="131" REF="138">
large ears hanging over their eyes; are &s;hort-legged, &s;mall-boned, and are readily made fat. Some of the&s;e have been fed to an almo&s;t incredible &s;ize. Mr Culley, in his treati&s;e on live &s;tock, gives an account of one that was killed at Congleton in Che&s;hire, which mea|&s;ured, from the no&s;e to the end of the tail, three yards eight inches; in height, it was four feet and a half; and weighed, after it was killed, eighty-&s;ix &s;tones eleven pounds, avoirdupoi&s;e.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e or black breed are now very common in England. They are &s;maller, have &s;horter legs, and their fle&s;h is whiter and &s;weeter than the common kind.</P>
<P>The Hog &s;pecies, though very numerous, and diffu&s;ed over Europe, A&s;ia, and Africa, did not exi&s;t in Ame|rica, till tran&s;ported thither by the Spaniards. In ma|ny places they have multiplied exceedingly, and become wild. They re&s;emble the dome&s;tic Hog; but their bo|dies are &s;horter, and their &s;nout and &s;kin thicker.</P>

<P>lives in a wild, uncultivated &s;tate, in the hotte&s;t parts of Africa. It is a very vicious animal, and quick in all its motions. It is as dangerous to attack one of them, as a Lion: For, though much &s;maller, it ru&s;hes upon a man as &s;wift as an arrow; and throwing him down before he has time to &s;trike with his javelin, breaks his legs, and at the &s;ame in&s;tant rips up his belly.</P>
<P>It has four tu&s;ks: Two very large ones proceed from the upper jaw, and turn upwards like a horn,&mdash;in length nine inches, and full five inches round at the ba&s;e; the two other tu&s;ks, which come from the lower jaw, project but three inches from the mouth. The&s;e tu&s;ks the ani|mal makes u&s;e of as the dreadful in&s;truments of his ven|geance. He will attack a man on hor&s;eback, if he &s;hould venture to come too near him; and fir&s;t breaking the Hor&s;e's legs, kills both him and his rider.</P>
<P>Sparrman de&s;cribes it as being of a bright yellow co|lour, like the dome&s;tic kind. Its no&s;e is broad, flat, and
<PB N="133" REF="140">
of a horny hardne&s;s; its head is very large in proportion to the &s;ize of its body; underneath each eye it has a great lobe or wattle, lying almo&s;t horizontally, broad, flat, rounded at the end, and placed &s;o as to intercept the view of any thing immediately beneath the animal; the ears are large and &s;harp-pointed, lined on the in&s;ide with long whiti&s;h hairs; its tail is &s;lender and flat; when the animal is pur&s;ued, it always holds it quite erect.</P>
<P>They live in holes under ground, the avenues to which are exceedingly narrow. The natives &s;eldom dare attack them in their retreats, as there is always danger of their ru&s;hing out unawares. When pur&s;ued with their young ones, it is no uncommon thing to &s;ee them take them up in their mouths, and run with them in that manner at a great rate.</P>
<P>From the &s;hortne&s;s of their necks, they frequently fall on their knees to feed; and change this po&s;ture to that of &s;tanding with the greate&s;t ea&s;e.</P>

<P>inhabits the hotte&s;t parts of South-America, where the &s;pecies is very numerous: Herds, con&s;i&s;ting of two or three hundred, are &s;ometimes to be &s;een together.&mdash;It is a very fierce animal; and will fight &s;toutly with bea&s;ts of prey, when attacked by them. The Jaguar, or Ameri|can Leopard, is its mortal enemy; and frequently lo&s;es its life in engaging a number of the&s;e animals. They a&s;|&s;i&s;t each other, &s;urround their enemies, and often come off victorious.</P>
<P>They live chiefly in mountainous places; and are not fond of wallowing in the mire, like the common Hog. They feed on fruits, roots, and feeds: They likewi&s;e eat &s;erpents, toads, and lizards; and are very dexterous in fir&s;t taking off the &s;kins with their fore feet and teeth.</P>
<P>The Peccary in appearance re&s;embles the Hog, though &s;omewhat &s;maller; its body is covered with &s;trong bri&s;|tles, which, when the creature is irritated, ri&s;e up like the prickles of a Hedgehog, and are nearly as &s;trong; they are of a du&s;ky colour, with alternate rings of white;
<PB N="135" REF="142">
acro&s;s the &s;houlders to the brea&s;t, there is a band of white; its head is &s;hort and thick; it has two tu&s;ks in each jaw; its ears are &s;mall and erect; and in&s;tead of a tail, it has a &s;mall fle&s;hy protuberance, which does not cover its po&s;teriors. It differs mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially from the Hog, as well as every other animal, in having a &s;mall orifice on the lower part of the back, from whence a thin watery humour, of a mo&s;t di&s;agreeable &s;mell, flows very copiou&s;ly. In the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, Dr Ty&s;on has de&s;cribed this orifice very minutely, as well as &s;ome other peculiarities in the conformation of its &s;to|mach and inte&s;tines.</P>
<P>This animal, like the Hog, is very prolific. The young ones follow the mother till they are able to pro|vide for them&s;elves. If taken at fir&s;t, they are ea&s;ily tamed, and &s;oon lo&s;e all their natural ferocity; but can never be brought to di&s;cover any &s;igns of attachment to tho&s;e that feed them. They do no mi&s;chief, and may be allowed to run about at plea&s;ure. They &s;eldom &s;tray far from home, but return of their own accord.&mdash;When an|gry, they grunt like the Hog, but much &s;tronger and har&s;her; and when &s;uddenly alarmed, make a &s;harp noi&s;e with their breath, and erect their bri&s;tles.</P>
<P>The fle&s;h of the Peccary, though drier and leaner than that of our Hog, is by no means di&s;agreeable, and may be greatly improved by ca&s;tration. When killed, the dor&s;el gland mu&s;t be immediately cut off: If this opera|tion be deferred for the &s;pace of half an hour, the fle&s;h becomes utterly unfit to be eaten.</P>
<P>Although the European Hog is common in America, and in many parts has become wild, the Peccary has ne|ver been known to breed with it: They frequently go to|gether,

<PB N="137" REF="144">
Wild Boar, from the under jaw, pointing upwards, and &s;tanding near eight inches out of the &s;ockets; the two others ri&s;e up like horns on the out&s;ide of the upper jaw, ju&s;t above the no&s;e, and extend in a curve above the eyes, almo&s;t touching the forehead, and are twelve inches in length. The&s;e tu&s;ks are of the mo&s;t beautiful ivory, but not &s;o hard as tho&s;e of the Elephant.</P>
<P>This animal abounds in &s;everal of the i&s;lands of the Ea&s;t-Indies; particularly Buero, a &s;mall i&s;le near Am|boyna.</P>
<P>Though formidable in appearance, it is ea&s;ily tamed; and its fle&s;h is well ta&s;ted. It lives on leaves of trees and other vegetables. Its &s;cent is exqui&s;ite; it can di&s;co|ver the approach of Dogs at a di&s;tance. When clo&s;ely pur&s;ued, it plunges into the &s;ea, &s;wims and dives with great facility from one i&s;land to another, and by that means frequently e&s;capes from its pur&s;uers.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals live in herds; and when any number of them are together, their odour is &s;o &s;trong, that the Dogs can &s;cent them at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. When attacked, they growl frightfully, and defend them&s;elves with their under tu&s;ks; the upper ones are only &s;ervicea|ble to them in taking their repo&s;e, which they do like the elephant, by hooking them on the branches of trees.</P>

<P>We are indebted to the labours of many learned and ingenious naturali&s;ts for accurate de&s;criptions of this wonderful creature, which in &s;ize is only exceeded by the Elephant, and in &s;trength and power is inferior to no other animal. Bontius &s;ays, that in the bulk of its body it equals the Elephant, but is lower only on ac|count of the &s;hortne&s;s of its legs.</P>
<P>The length of this animal, from the extremity of the muzzle to the in&s;ertion of the tail, is u&s;ually twelve feet; and the circumference of its body nearly equal to its length: Its no&s;e is armed with a formidable weapon, pe|culiar to this creature, being a very hard and &s;olid horn, with which it defends it&s;elf from every adver&s;ary. The Tiger will rather attack the Elephant, who&s;e trunk it can lay hold of, than the Rhinoceros, which it cannot face, without danger of having its bowels torn out. The body and limbs of the Rhinoceros are covered with a &s;kin &s;o hard and impenetrable, that he fears neither the claws of the Tiger, nor the more formidable probo&s;cis of the
<PB N="142" REF="149">
Elephant; it will turn the edge of a &s;cimitar, and even re&s;i&s;t the force of a mu&s;ket-ball. The &s;kin, which is of a blacki&s;h colour, forms it&s;elf into large folds at the neck, the &s;houlders, and the crupper, by which the motion of the head and limbs is facilitated; round the neck, which is very &s;hort, are two large folds; there is a fold from the &s;houlders, which hangs down upon the fore legs; and another from the hind part of the back to the thighs. The body is every-where covered with &s;mall tubero&s;ities or knots, which are &s;mall on the neck and back, but larger on the &s;ides: The thighs, legs, and even the feet, are full of the&s;e incru&s;tations, which have been mi&s;taken for &s;cales by &s;ome authors: They are, however, only &s;im|ple indurations of the &s;kin, without any uniformity in their figure, or regularity in their po&s;itions. Between the folds, the &s;kin is penetrable and delicate, as &s;oft to the touch as &s;ilk, and of a light-fle&s;h colour; the &s;kin of the belly is nearly of the &s;ame colour and con&s;i&s;tency. The body of the Rhinoceros is long and thick; its belly is large, and hangs near the ground; its legs &s;hort, round, and very &s;trong; and its hoofs are divided into three parts, each pointing forward. The head of this animal is large; its ears long and erect; and its eyes &s;mall, &s;unk, and without vivacity; the upper lip is long, overhangs the lower, and is capable of great exten&s;ion: It is &s;o pliable, that the Rhinoceros can move it from &s;ide to &s;ide, twi&s;t it round a &s;tick, collect its food, or &s;eize with it any thing it would carry to its mouth.</P>
<P>The Rhinoceros, without being ferocious, carnivorous, or even extremely wild, is, however, totally untractable and rude. It &s;eems to be &s;ubject to paroxy&s;ms of fury, which nothing can appea&s;e. That which Emanuel, king
<PB N="143" REF="150">
of Portugal, &s;ent to the pope in the year 1513, de&s;troyed the ve&s;&s;el in which they were tran&s;porting it.</P>
<P>Like the Hog, this animal is fond of wallowing in the mire. It is a &s;olitary animal, loves moi&s;t and mar&s;hy grounds, and &s;eldom quits the banks of rivers.&mdash;It is found in Bengal, Siam, China, and other countries of A&s;ia; in the i&s;les of Java, Sumatra, Ceylon, &amp;c.; in Ethiopia, and the country as low as the Cape of Good Hope: But in general, the &s;pecies is not numerous, and is much le&s;s diffu&s;ed than that of the Elephant.</P>
<P>The female produces but one at a time, and at con&s;i|derable intervals. During the fir&s;t month, the young Rhinoceros exceeds not the &s;ize of a large Dog. At the age of two years, the horn is not more than an inch long; at &s;ix years old, it is nine or ten inches long; and grows to the length of three feet and a half, and &s;ome|times four feet. The horn is much e&s;teemed by the na|tives as an antidote again&s;t poi&s;on, as well as a remedy for particular di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>The Rhinoceros feeds on the gro&s;&s;e&s;t herbs, and pre|fers thi&s;tles and &s;hrubs to &s;oft or delicate pa&s;turage. It is fond of the &s;ugar-cane, and eats all kinds of grain.</P>
<P>Dr Par&s;ons remarks, that this animal has an acute and very attentive ear: It will li&s;ten with a deep and long-continued attention to any kind of noi&s;e; and, though it be eating, lying down, or obeying any pre&s;&s;ing demands of Nature, it will rai&s;e its head, and li&s;ten till the noi&s;e cea&s;e.</P>
<P>From the peculiar con&s;truction of his eyes, the Rhi|noceros can only &s;ee what is immediately before him. When he pur&s;ues any object, he proceeds always in a direct line, overturning every ob&s;truction. With the
<PB N="144" REF="151">
horn on his no&s;e, he tears up trees, rai&s;es &s;tones, and throws them behind him to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance.&mdash;His &s;en&s;e of &s;melling is &s;o exqui&s;ite, that the hunters are obliged to avoid being to windward of him. They fol|low him at a di&s;tance, and watch till he lies down to &s;leep: They then approach with great precaution, and di&s;charge their mu&s;kets all at once into the lower part of the belly.</P>
<P>The Rhinoceros is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the <HI>Unicorn</HI> of holy writ, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the properties a&s;cribed to that ani|mal, &mdash;rage, untameablene&s;s, great &s;wiftne&s;s, and immen&s;e &s;trength.&mdash;It was known to the Romans in very early times, and is handed down to us in &s;ome of the works of that celebrated people.

</FIGURE> THE TWO-HORNED RHINOCEROS.</HEAD>
<P>We have given the figure of this animal from Mr Sparrman, who&s;e authenticity there is every rea&s;on to depend upon, and who has given a mo&s;t exact anatomi|cal de&s;cription of this hitherto unde&s;cribed animal. Of two that were &s;hot, he only mentions the &s;ize of the &s;maller of them, which was eleven feet and a half long, &s;even feet high, and twelve in circumference. It was without any folds on the &s;kin, which was of an a&s;h co|lour; excepting about the groin, where it was of a fle&s;h-colour. The &s;urface of the &s;kin was &s;cabrous and knot|ty, of a clo&s;e texture, and when dry extremely hard. There were no hairs on any part of the body, except the edges of the ears and the tip of the tail, which were furni&s;hed with a few dark bri&s;tly hairs, about an inch long.</P>
<P>The horns of this animal are placed one behind the other, in a line with the no&s;e: The foremo&s;t of them mea&s;ures about eighteen inches in length, and is always
<PB N="146" REF="153">
the larger of the two. It is remarkable, that the Rhino|ceros makes u&s;e of the &s;horter horn only for the purpo&s;e of digging up roots, which compo&s;e great part of its food; it being endued with the power of turning the larger horn on one &s;ide out of the way. The &s;hape of the horns is conical, with the tips inclining a little back|wards; the texture of the lower part is rough, and &s;eems as if it con&s;i&s;ted of horny fibres; the upper part is &s;mooth and plain, like tho&s;e of an Ox. The feet are round, and do not &s;pread much: They have three hoofs on each of them, which project but little; the middle one is the longe&s;t. The eyes of the Rhinoceros are &s;mall, and &s;unk into its head; in con&s;equence of which it &s;ees indi&s;tinct|ly: But its organs of hearing and &s;melling are very acute. At the lea&s;t noi&s;e, the creature takes the alarm, pricks up its ears, and li&s;tens with great attention: If it happen to catch the &s;cent of any per&s;on within a &s;mall di&s;tance, it ru&s;hes out with a&s;toni&s;hing quickne&s;s; and it is diffi|cult to avoid the impetuous attack of this powerful ani|mal.</P>
<P>It has been generally &s;aid of the Rhinoceros, that its tongue is &s;o hard and rough as to take away the &s;kin and fle&s;h wherever it licks any per&s;on that has unfortunately fallen a victim to its fury: Mr Sparrman &s;ays, however, that he thru&s;t his hand into the mouth of one that had ju&s;t been &s;hot, and found the tongue perfectly &s;oft and &s;mooth.&mdash;From the account of its inte&s;tines, given us by the &s;ame ingenious author, we &s;hall ju&s;t mention the fol|lowing, which will enable our readers to form a more perfect idea of its enormous bulk:&mdash;The &s;tomach was four feet in length, and two in diameter; to which was annexed a tube or canal, twenty-eight feet long, and &s;ix
<PB N="147" REF="154">
inches diameter; the kidnies were a foot and a half in breadth; the heart was a foot and a half long, and nearly the &s;ame in breadth; the liver, when mea&s;ured from right to left, was found to be three feet and a half in breadth, and two feet and a half deep, as it hangs in the animal's body when it is in a &s;tanding po&s;ition; it had no gall-bladder, in which it re&s;embles the Hor&s;e. Upon opening the &s;tomach, the contents of it were found to con&s;i&s;t of roots and &s;mall branches of trees ma&s;ticated, &s;ome of which were as big as the end of a man's finger; in the ma&s;s there appeared a great quantity of &s;ucculent plants, as well as &s;ome that were har&s;h and prickly: The effluvium ari&s;ing from this ma&s;s was &s;o far from being of|fen&s;ive, that it diffu&s;ed around a very &s;trong and not di&s;|agreeable aromatic odour. We &s;hall conclude our ac|count of this animal by ob&s;erving, that the cavity which contained the brains was &s;mall, being barely &s;ix inches long, and four high, and of an oval &s;hape: Being filled with pea&s;e, it was found to contain barely one quart; a human &s;kull, mea&s;ured at the &s;ame time, did not require much le&s;s than three pints to fill it.</P>

<P>Though the Hippopotamus has been celebrated from the remote&s;t antiquity; though the &s;acred writings men|tion him under the name of <HI>Behemoth;</HI> and though his fi|gure is to be &s;een engraven on Egyptian obeli&s;ks, and on Roman medals; yet his hi&s;tory was very imperfectly known to the ancients. Ari&s;totle &s;ays, that he has a mane like a Hor&s;e, and hoofs like an Ox; tu&s;ks and tail like a Boar; that he is of the &s;ize of an A&s;s, and has the voice of a Hor&s;e; with other things equally ab&s;urd;&mdash;all which Pliny has copied; and, in&s;tead of correcting, has added to the number of his errors.&mdash;Of the accounts of later writers, it is much to be lamented that &s;uitable deli|neations have not accompanied their accurate de&s;criptions &mdash;A general defect, by which the &s;tudy of nature has
<PB N="149" REF="156">
been much retarded, the laborious re&s;earches of many learned and ingenious naturali&s;ts greatly fru&s;trated, and the errors of former times repeatedly copied and multi|plied without number.</P>
<P>The &s;ize of the Hippopotamus is nearly equal to that of the Elephant. It inhabits all the larger rivers of Afri|ca, from the Niger to the Cape of Good Hope; but is found in none of the African rivers that run into the Me|diterranean, except the Nile, and in that part of it only which is in the Upper Egypt, and in the fens and lakes of Ethiopia, through which that river pa&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The head of this animal is enormou&s;ly large; its mouth va&s;tly wide. Ray &s;ays, that the upper mandible is move|able, like that of a Crocodile: In each jaw there are four cutting teeth; tho&s;e in the lower jaw point &s;traight for|ward: It has four large tu&s;ks; the large&s;t, which are al|ways in the lower jaw, are &s;ometimes above two feet long: It is &s;aid that the canine teeth are &s;o hard, as to emit fire on being &s;truck with &s;teel; they are perfectly white, and preferable to ivory for making artificial teeth: The grinders are &s;quare or oblong, like tho&s;e of a man; and &s;o large, that a &s;ingle tooth weighs above three pounds: The &s;kin is of a du&s;ky colour, bears a re&s;em|blance to that of the Rhinoceros, but is thicker, and is made into whips: The tail is near a foot long, taper, and flatted at the end, which is thinly furni&s;hed with hairs like bri&s;tles: Its legs are &s;o &s;hort, that its belly almo&s;t touches the ground: The hoofs are divided into four parts, unconnected by membranes, although it is an am|phibious animal. When alarmed or pur&s;ued, it takes to the water, plunges in, and &s;inks to the bottom; where it walks at full ea&s;e: It often ri&s;es to the &s;urface, and re|mains
<PB N="150" REF="157">
with its head out of the water, making a bellow|ing noi&s;e, which may be heard at a great di&s;tance. It feeds during night on the banks of the rivers, and &s;ome|times does great damage in the adjacent plantations of rice and other grain. It is &s;aid likewi&s;e, that it feeds upon fi&s;h; but Dr Sparrman, in his account of this ani|mal, denies that it &s;eeks any other food than herbs and gra&s;s.</P>
<P>The Hippopotamus is naturally a mild and gentle ani|mal, very &s;low and heavy in its movements upon land, but in the water bold and active; and when provoked or wounded, will ri&s;e, and attack boats or canoes with great fury. Dampier &s;ays, he has known one of the&s;e animals &s;ink a boat full of people, by biting a hole in the bottom with his great tu&s;ks.&mdash;The method of taking them is by digging pits in the &s;and, in tho&s;e parts through which the animal pa&s;&s;es in his way to the river after he has been feeding.</P>
<P>Sparrman &s;ays, that the fle&s;h of the Hippopotamus is tender and good, that the fat is fine and well ta&s;ted, and much in reque&s;t with the coloni&s;ts at the Cape, who look upon it as the mo&s;t whole&s;ome meat that can be eaten.

</FIGURE> THE ELEPHANT.</HEAD>
<P>Of all the creatures that have hitherto been taken into the &s;ervice of man, the Elephant is pre-eminent in the &s;ize and &s;trength of his body, and inferior to none in &s;a|gacity and obedience. From time immemorial this ani|mal has been employed either for the purpo&s;es of labour, of war, or of o&s;tentatious parade; to increa&s;e the gran|deur of ea&s;tern princes, extend their power, or enlarge their dominions.</P>
<P>The Elephant is a native of A&s;ia and Africa, and is not to be found in its natural &s;tate either in Europe or America. From the river Senegal to the Cape of Good Hope, they are met with in great numbers: In this ex|ten&s;ive region, as they are more numerous than in any other part of the world, &s;o are they le&s;s fearful of man. The &s;avage inhabitants of this dreary country, in&s;tead of attempting to &s;ubdue this powerful animal, and render it
<PB N="152" REF="159">
&s;ub&s;ervient to their nece&s;&s;ities, &s;eem de&s;irous only of avoiding its fury.</P>
<P>Sparrman &s;ays, that in the country near the Cape they are &s;ometimes &s;een in large herds, con&s;i&s;ting of many hundreds; and thinks it probable, that in the more re|mote and unfrequented parts of that va&s;t country, they are &s;till more numerous.</P>
<P>They are frequently hunted by the coloni&s;ts at the Cape, who are very expert in &s;hooting them, and make great advantage of their teeth. The large&s;t teeth weigh a hundred and fifty Dutch pounds, and are &s;old to the governor for as many guilders; &s;o that a man may earn three hundred guilders at one &s;hot. It is not therefore to be wondered, that a traffic &s;o lucrative &s;hould tempt the hunters to run great ri&s;ks. In approaching this ani|mal, great care mu&s;t be taken to &s;teal upon him unper|ceived: If the Elephant di&s;covers his enemy near him, he ru&s;hes out, and endeavours to kill him. One of the&s;e hunters being out upon a plain, under the &s;helter of a few &s;cattered thorn trees, thought he &s;hould be able to advance near enough to &s;hoot an Elephant that was at a little di&s;tance from him: He was di&s;covered, pur&s;ued, and overtaken by the animal, which laid hold of him with his trunk, and beat him in&s;tantly to death.</P>
<P>The height of the Elephant at the Cape is from twelve to fifteen feet. The female is le&s;s than the male, and her tu&s;ks do not grow to &s;uch a &s;ize.&mdash;The ears are pro|digiou&s;ly large, and marked on the edges with deep inci|&s;ions: They are pendulous, except when the animal is irritated; at which time he draws them up almo&s;t in the form of a pur&s;e, and points them forward. The ear of an Elephant &s;hot at the Cape, was &s;aid to reach from the
<PB N="153" REF="160">
&s;houlders of a middle-&s;ized Hottentot to the ground.&mdash; There are four grinders in each jaw, clo&s;ely united toge|ther, forming, with the jaw-bone, one hard and compact body. One of the&s;e grinders &s;ometimes mea&s;ures nine inches broad, and weighs four pounds and a half.&mdash;The texture of the &s;kin is uneven, wrinkled, and knotty; full of deep fi&s;&s;ures, nearly re&s;embling the bark of an old oak tree, which run in all directions over the &s;urface of it: It is of a tawny colour, inclining to citron. In the fi&s;|&s;ures there are &s;ome bri&s;tly hairs, which are al&s;o thinly &s;cattered over the body.&mdash;The legs of this creature re|&s;emble ma&s;&s;y columns, of fifteen or eighteen inches dia|meter, and from five to &s;ix feet high.&mdash;The foot is &s;hort, and divided into five toes, covered with the &s;kin, &s;o as not to be vi&s;ible. To each toe there is affixed a nail or hoof, of a horny &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable feature of the Elephant is his trunk or probo&s;cis, which is compo&s;ed of membranes, nerves, and mu&s;cles. It is both an organ of feeling and of motion. The animal cannot only move and bend it, but can contract, lengthen, and turn it in every direction. The extremity of the trunk terminates in a protuberance, which &s;tretches out on the upper &s;ide in the form of a finger, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in a great degree the nicene&s;s and dexterity of that u&s;eful member. It is equally flexible, and as capable of laying hold of objects as the fingers of a man. He lifts from the ground the &s;malle&s;t piece of money; he &s;elects herbs and flowers, and picks them up one by one; he unties the knots of ropes, opens and &s;huts gates, &amp;c. With his trunk he gra&s;ps any body which it is applied to, &s;o firmly, that no force can tear it from his gripe.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="161">Of all the in&s;truments which Nature has &s;o liberally be&s;towed on her mo&s;t favourite productions, the trunk of the Elephant is perhaps the mo&s;t complete and the mo&s;t admirable. Ray &s;ays, it is divided into three partitions or chambers, two of which run in &s;piral directions, and the other in a right line. It is eight feet long in an Ele|phant of fourteen feet high, and five feet in circumfe|rence at the thicke&s;t part. The no&s;trils are &s;ituated at the extremity, through which it draws in water by a &s;trong &s;uction, either for the purpo&s;e of quenching its thir&s;t, or of wa&s;hing and cooling it&s;elf, which it fre|quently does, by taking up a large quantity, part of which it carries to its mouth, and drinks; and by ele|vating the trunk, allows the remainder to run over every part of its body.</P>
<P>Roots, herbs, leaves, and tender wood, are the ordi|nary food of the Elephant: It likewi&s;e eats grains and fruit, but will not eat fle&s;h nor fi&s;h. When one of them di&s;covers a plentiful pa&s;ture, he calls to the others, and invites them to eat with him. As they require a great quantity of forage, they frequently change their pa&s;ture, and do incredible damage whenever they happen to &s;tray on cultivated ground. From the weight of their bodies and the &s;ize of their feet, they de&s;troy much more than they u&s;e for food. One of them will eat one hundred and fifty pounds of gra&s;s in a day; &s;o that a troop of the&s;e animals lays a whole country wa&s;te in a &s;hort time. The Indians and negroes u&s;e every artifice to prevent the approach of the&s;e unwelcome vi&s;itants, making loud noi&s;es, and kindling fires round their habitations; but in &s;pite of all their precautions, the Elephants often break through their fences, de&s;troy their whole harve&s;t, and
<PB N="155" REF="162">
overturn their huts. It is not ea&s;y to &s;eparate them: They generally act in concert, whether they attack, march, or fly.</P>
<P>The ordinary walk of the Elephant is not quicker than that of a Hor&s;e; but when pu&s;hed, he a&s;&s;umes a kind of ambling pace, which in fleetne&s;s is equal to a gallop. He goes forward with ea&s;e and celerity; but it is with great difficulty that he turns him&s;elf round, and that not without taking a pretty large circuit. It is generally in narrow and hollow places that the negroes attack him, and cut off his tail, which they value above every other part of his body.&mdash;He &s;wims well, and is of great u&s;e in carrying great quantities of baggage over large rivers. When &s;wimming, he rai&s;es his long trunk above the &s;ur|face of the water for the &s;ake of re&s;piration, every other part of his body being below: In this manner &s;everal of the&s;e animals &s;wim together, and &s;teer their cour&s;e with|out danger of running foul of each other.</P>
<P>The Elephant, when tamed, is gentle, obedient, and docile: Patient of labour, it &s;ubmits to the mo&s;t toil&s;ome drudgery; and &s;o attentive to the commands of its go|vernor, that a word or a look is &s;ufficient to &s;timulate it to the mo&s;t violent exertions. Its attachment to its keeper is &s;o great, that it care&s;&s;es him with its trunk, and frequently will obey no other ma&s;ter: It knows his voice, and can di&s;tingui&s;h the tone of command, of anger, or of approbation, and regulates its actions accordingly: It receives his orders with attention, and executes them with eagerne&s;s, but without precipitation. All its mo|tions are orderly, and &s;eem to corre&s;pond with the digni|ty of its appearance, being grave, maje&s;tic, and cautious. It kneels down for the accommodation of tho&s;e who
<PB N="156" REF="163">
would mount upon its back, and with its pliant trunk even a&s;&s;i&s;ts them to a&s;cend. It &s;uffers it&s;elf to be har|ne&s;&s;ed, and &s;eems to have a plea&s;ure in the finery of its trappings. It is u&s;ed in drawing chariots, waggons, and various kinds of machines. One of the&s;e animals will perform with ea&s;e the work of many Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>The conductor of the Elephant is u&s;ually mounted on its neck; and makes u&s;e of a rod of iron, &s;harp at the end, and hooked, with which he urges the animal for|ward, by pricking its head, ears, or muzzle; but in ge|neral, a word from the keeper is &s;ufficient to encourage this intelligent creature to proceed on its way, or perform the ta&s;k a&s;&s;igned to it.&mdash;In India, where they were once employed in launching &s;hips, one of them was directed to force a large ve&s;&s;el into the water; which proving &s;u|perior to its &s;trength, the ma&s;ter, in an angry tone, cried out, 'Take away that lazy bea&s;t, and bring another in its place.' The poor animal in&s;tantly redoubled its efforts, fractured its &s;kull, and died upon the &s;pot.</P>
<P>The Indians, from very early periods, have employed Elephants in their wars: Porus oppo&s;ed the pa&s;&s;age of Alexander over the Hyda&s;pes with eighty-five of the&s;e animals. M. de Buffon imagines that it was &s;ome of the Elephants taken by that monarch, and afterwards tran|&s;ported into Greece, which were employed by Pyrrhus again&s;t the Romans.&mdash;Since the invention of fire-arms, the Elephant has been of little u&s;e in deciding the con|te&s;ts of ho&s;tile nations; for, being terrified with the fla&s;h of the powder and the report that immediately &s;uc|ceeds, they are &s;oon thrown into confu&s;ion, and then become dangerous to their employers.&mdash;They are now chiefly u&s;ed for the purpo&s;es of labour or magnificent pa|rade.
<PB N="157" REF="164">
The Indian princes, in their travels, are attended by hundreds of the&s;e animals: Some are employed to convey the ladies which compo&s;e the &s;eraglio, in latticed cages made for that purpo&s;e, and covered with branches of trees; whil&s;t others tran&s;port immen&s;e quantities of baggage, with which the &s;overeigns of the Ea&s;t are al|ways accompanied in their marches from one place to another. They are likewi&s;e made u&s;e of as the dreadful in&s;truments of executing condemned criminals&mdash;a ta&s;k which they perform with great dexterity. At the word of command, they break the limbs of the criminal with their trunks; they &s;ometimes trample him to death, or impale him on their enormous tu&s;ks, ju&s;t as they are di|rected by their more barbarous keeper.</P>
<P>It is a &s;ingular circum&s;tance in the hi&s;tory of this ex|traordinary animal, that, in a &s;tate of &s;ubjection, it is unalterably barren; and, though it has been reduced un|der the dominion of man for ages, it has never been known to breed,&mdash;as if it had a proper &s;en&s;e of its de|graded condition, and ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed to increa&s;e the pride and power of its conqueror by propagating a race of &s;laves. It therefore follows, that of all the numerous bands of the&s;e creatures that are trained to &s;ervice, there is not one that has not been originally wild, nor one that has not been forced into a &s;tate of &s;ubjection. To recruit, therefore, the numbers that are unavoidably con|&s;umed by di&s;ea&s;e, accident, or age, the ea&s;tern princes are obliged every year to &s;end into the fore&s;ts, and to u&s;e various methods to procure fre&s;h &s;upplies.</P>
<P>The manner of taking, taming, and rendering the&s;e animals &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, is curious, and well de&s;erves a place in the hi&s;tory of the Elephant:&mdash;In the mid&s;t of a fore&s;t
<PB N="158" REF="165">
abounding with Elephants, a large piece of ground is marked out, and &s;urrounded with &s;trong pali&s;ades, inter|woven with branches of trees: One end of the inclo&s;ure is narrow; from which it widens gradually, &s;o as to take in a great extent of country. Several thou&s;and men are employed upon the occa&s;ion, who place them&s;elves in &s;uch a manner as to prevent the wild Elephants from making their e&s;cape: They kindle large fires at certain di&s;tances, and make a dreadful noi&s;e with drums and various kinds of di&s;cordant in&s;truments, calculated for the purpo&s;e of &s;tunning and terrifying the poor animals; whil&s;t another party, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ome thou&s;ands, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tame female Elephants, trained for the purpo&s;e, drive the wild Elephants &s;lowly towards the great opening of the inclo&s;ure, the whole train of hun|ters clo&s;ing in after them, &s;houting, and making a great noi&s;e, till the Elephants are driven by in&s;en&s;ible degrees into the narrow part of the inclo&s;ure, through which there is an opening into a &s;maller &s;pace, &s;trongly fenced in, and guarded on all &s;ides. As &s;oon as one of the Ele|phants enters this &s;trait, a &s;trong bar clo&s;es the pa&s;&s;age from behind, and he finds him&s;elf completely environed. On the top of this narrow pa&s;&s;age &s;ome of the hunt&s;men &s;tand with goads in their hands, urging the creature for|ward to the end of the pa&s;&s;age, where there is an open|ing, ju&s;t wide enough to let him pa&s;s. He is now re|ceived into the cu&s;tody of two female Elephants, who &s;tand on each &s;ide of him, and pre&s;s him into the &s;ervice: If he is likely to prove refractory, they begin to di&s;ci|pline him with their trunks, till he is reduced to obedi|ence, and &s;uffers him&s;elf to be led to a tree, where he is bound by the leg with &s;tout thongs, made of untanned
<PB N="159" REF="166">
elk or buck &s;kin. The tame Elephants are then led back to the inclo&s;ure; and the others are made to &s;ubmit in the &s;ame manner. They are all &s;uffered to remain fa&s;t to the trees for &s;everal days. Attendants are placed by the &s;ide of each animal, who &s;upply him with food by lit|tle and little, till he is brought by degrees to be &s;en&s;ible of kindne&s;s and care&s;&s;es, and allows him&s;elf to be led to the &s;table. In the &s;pace of fourteen days, his ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is completed. During that time he is fed dai|ly with cocoa-nut leaves, and led once a day to the water by the tame ones. He becomes accu&s;tomed to the voice of his keeper, and at la&s;t quietly re&s;igns his prodigious powers to the dominion and &s;ervice of man.</P>
<P>The time of ge&s;tation in this animal is hitherto but im|perfectly known: Ari&s;totle &s;ays, it goes two years with young; which is the more likely, as the &s;ea&s;on of de&s;ire in the male returns but once in three years. The female produces one young at a time. The young Elephants are &s;aid to &s;uck with their trunk. The brea&s;ts of the fe|male are &s;ituated between its fore legs.</P>
<P>This animal is thirty years in arriving at its full growth; and is &s;aid to live, though in a &s;tate of capti|vity, to the age of a hundred and twenty or a hundred and thirty years: In a &s;tate of unre&s;trained freedom, they are &s;uppo&s;ed to live much longer.</P>
<P>The Elephant will drink wine, and is fond of &s;piritous liquors. By &s;hewing him a ve&s;&s;el filled with arrack, he is induced to exert the greate&s;t efforts, and perform the mo&s;t painful ta&s;ks, in hopes of receiving it as the reward of his labour. To di&s;appoint him is dangerous, as he &s;eldom fails to be revenged. The following in&s;tance is given as a fact, and de&s;erves to be recorded:&mdash;An Ele|phant
<PB N="160" REF="167">
di&s;appointed of its reward, out of revenge killed his cornac or governor. The poor man's wife, who be|held the dreadful &s;cene, took her two infants, and threw them at the feet of the enraged animal, &s;aying, 'Since you have &s;lain my hu&s;band, take my life al&s;o, as well as that of my children.' The Elephant in&s;tantly &s;topped, relented, and, as if &s;tung with remor&s;e, took the elde&s;t boy in its trunk, placed him on its neck, adopted him for its cornac, and would never allow any other per&s;on to mount it.</P>
<P>This animal &s;eems to know when it is mocked, and never fails to retaliate accordingly. A painter wi&s;hed to draw the animal in an unu&s;ual attitude, with its trunk elevated, and its mouth open. In order to induce the Elephant to exhibit to more advantage, a per&s;on was em|ployed to throw fruit into its mouth, who &s;ometimes de|ceived it by only making an offer of doing &s;o, and retain|ing at the &s;ame time the fruit in his hand. Enraged at this kind of treatment; and, as it &s;hould &s;eem, gue&s;&s;ing the painter to be the cau&s;e, it threw out &s;uch a quantity of water from its trunk, as &s;poiled his paper, and pre|vented him from proceeding in his work.</P>
<P>We might quote many other facts equally curious and intere&s;ting: Tho&s;e we have already recited are &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that the Elephant is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of in&s;tinctive fa|culties &s;uperior to tho&s;e of any other animal. We mu&s;t at the &s;ame time admire the admirable order of that di&s;pen&s;ation, which, to an animal of &s;uch unequalled powers, has added a di&s;po&s;ition &s;o mild and tractable. What ravages might we not expect from the prodigious &s;trength of the Elephant, combined with the fiercene&s;s and rapacity of the Tiger!</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="168">We cannot clo&s;e our account of the Elephant, with|out taking &s;ome notice of the teeth of that animal, which have been &s;o frequently found in a fo&s;&s;il &s;tate in various parts of the world. Some years ago, two great grinding-teeth, and part of the tu&s;k of an Elephant, were di&s;co|vered, at the depth of forty-two yards, in a lead mine, in Flint&s;hire, lying in a bed of gravel: The grinders were almo&s;t as perfect as if they had been ju&s;t taken from the animal; the tu&s;k was much decayed, and very &s;oft.&mdash; Near the banks of many rivers in Siberia, large tu&s;ks and teeth have been frequently dug up, which have been at|tributed to a creature called the <HI>Mammouth;</HI> but they are now univer&s;ally believed to have belonged to the Ele|phant. The molares or grinders are perfectly the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent race; but both they and the tu&s;ks are much larger: Some of the latter have been known to weigh four hundred pounds; and grinders, of the weight of twenty-four pounds, have not unfrequently been di&s;covered. One of the&s;e was taken from a &s;keleton of the &s;ame head in which the tu&s;ks were found; and as the ivory of the latter was in every re&s;pect the &s;ame as that generally known, and made u&s;e of for the pur|po&s;es of u&s;eful and ornamental works, we cannot deny our a&s;&s;ent to the opinion of tho&s;e who &s;uppo&s;e them to have been once parts of the animals we have ju&s;t de|&s;cribed.&mdash;Tu&s;ks of a prodigious &s;ize, teeth, jaw-bones, thigh-bones, and vertebrae, have likewi&s;e been frequently found on the banks of the rivet Ohio, in America, five or &s;ix feet beneath the &s;urface. Some of the tu&s;ks are near &s;even feet long, one foot nine inches in circumfe|rence at the ba&s;e, and one foot near the point. They differ from tho&s;e of the Elephant in having a larger twi&s;t
<PB N="162" REF="169">
or &s;piral curve towards the &s;mall end. There is a &s;till greater difference in the form of the grinders, which are made like tho&s;e of a carnivorous animal, not flat and ribbed tran&s;ver&s;ely on their &s;urface, like tho&s;e of an Ele|phant, but furni&s;hed with a double row of high and co|nic projections, as if intended to ma&s;ticate, not grind, their food.&mdash;Specimens of the&s;e teeth and bones are de|po&s;ited in the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum, that of the Royal So|ciety, and in the cabinet of the late ingenious Dr Hun|ter.&mdash;The&s;e fo&s;&s;il bones are al&s;o found in Peru, and in the Brazils.&mdash;As yet, the living animal has evaded the &s;earch of the curious naturali&s;t. It is not improbable, that it may exi&s;t in &s;ome of tho&s;e remote parts of that va&s;t continent, yet impenetrated by Europeans.</P>

<P>WE have hitherto been employed in the plea&s;ing ta&s;k of de&s;cribing mo&s;t of tho&s;e numerous tribes of animals that are more nearly connected with the inte|re&s;ts of mankind; that &s;erve as the in&s;truments of man's happine&s;s, or at lea&s;t, that do not openly oppo&s;e him; that depend upon his care for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and in their turn contribute largely to his comfort and &s;upport. We have taken an ample range among the wilder inha|bitants of the fore&s;t, which, though in a more remote degree dependant upon man, are neverthele&s;s objects of his attention and pur&s;uit. We have followed Nature to her mo&s;t retired rece&s;&s;es, and have &s;een and admired her works under a variety of the mo&s;t beautiful living forms, but our progre&s;s has hitherto been un&s;tained with blood.</P>

</FIGURE> THE LION,</HEAD>
<P>WHICH is eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t, as well in &s;ize and &s;trength, as by his large and flowing mane.&mdash;This animal is produced in every part of Africa, and the hotte&s;t parts of A&s;ia. It is found in the greate&s;t numbers in the &s;corched and de&s;olate regions of the torrid zone, in the de&s;erts of Zaara and Biledul|gerid, and in all the interior parts of the va&s;t continent of Africa.&mdash;In the&s;e de&s;ert regions, from whence man|kind are driven by the rigorous heat of the climate, this animal reigns &s;ole ma&s;ter; its di&s;po&s;ition &s;eems to par|take of the ardour of its native &s;oil; inflamed by the in|fluence of a burning &s;un, its rage is mo&s;t tremendous, and its courage undaunted. Happily, indeed, the &s;pecies
<PB N="165" REF="172">
is not numerous, and is &s;aid to be greatly dimini&s;hed; for, if we may credit the te&s;timony of tho&s;e who have traver&s;ed the&s;e va&s;t de&s;erts, the number of Lions is not nearly &s;o great as formerly. Mr Shaw ob&s;erves, that the Romans carried more Lions from Lybia in one year for their public &s;pectacles, than could be found in all that country at this time. It is likewi&s;e remarked, that in Turkey, Per&s;ia, and the Indies, Lions are not now &s;o frequently met with as in former times.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved of this animal, that its courage dimi|ni&s;hes, and its caution and timidity are greater, in pro|portion as it approaches the habitations of the human race. Being acquainted with man, and the power of his arms, it lo&s;es its natural fortitude to &s;uch a degree, as to be terrified at the &s;ound of his voice. It has been known to fly even before women and children, who were found &s;ufficient to drive it away from its lurking places in the neighbourhood of their villages.</P>
<P>This alteration in the Lion's di&s;po&s;ition &s;ufficiently &s;hews, that it will admit of a certain degree of educa|tion: And it is a well-known fact, that the keepers of wild bea&s;ts frequently play with this animal, pull out his tongue, hold him by the teeth, and even cha&s;ti&s;e him without cau&s;e. The animal &s;eems to bear all with a &s;ul|len kind of compo&s;ure, and rarely retaliates this unme|rited treatment. It is dangerous, however, to provoke him too far, or to depend upon his temper with too great &s;ecurity. Labat tells us of a gentleman who kept a Lion in his chamber, and employed a &s;ervant to attend it; who, as is u&s;ual, mixed his blows with care&s;&s;es. This ill-judged a&s;&s;ociation continued for &s;ome time. One morning the gentleman was awakened by an unu&s;ual
<PB N="166" REF="173">
noi&s;e in his room; and, drawing his curtains, he per|ceived it to proceed from the Lion, which was growling over the body of the unhappy man, whom it had ju&s;t killed, and had &s;eparated his head from his body. The terror and confu&s;ion of the gentleman may be ea&s;ily con|ceived: He flew out of the room, and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome people, had the animal &s;ecured from doing fur|ther mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>As the pa&s;&s;ions of this animal are &s;trong, and its appe|tites vehement, we ought not to pre&s;ume that the im|pre&s;&s;ions of education will always be &s;ufficiently power|ful. It mu&s;t be dangerous, therefore, to &s;uffer it to re|main too long without food, or to per&s;i&s;t in irritating or abu&s;ing it.&mdash;However, numberle&s;s accounts a&s;&s;ure us, that the anger of the Lion is noble, its courage magna|nimous, and its temper &s;u&s;ceptible of grateful impre&s;&s;ions. It has been often &s;een to de&s;pi&s;e weak and contemptible enemies, and even to pardon their in&s;ults, when it was in its power to puni&s;h them. It has been known to &s;pare the life of an animal that was thrown to be devoured by it, to live in habits of perfect cordiality with it, to &s;hare its &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and even to give it a preference where its portion of food was &s;canty.</P>
<P>The form of the Lion is &s;trikingly bold and maje&s;tic: His large and &s;haggy mane, which he can erect at plea|&s;ure, &s;urrounding his awful front; his huge eye-brows; his round and fiery eye-balls, which, upon the lea&s;t irri|tation, &s;eem to glow with peculiar lu&s;tre; together with the formidable appearance of his teeth, exhibit a picture of terrific grandeur, which no words can de&s;cribe.&mdash;The length of the large&s;t Lion is between eight and nine feet, the tail about four feet, and its height about four feet
<PB N="167" REF="174">
and a half: The female is about one-fourth part le&s;s, and wants the mane.&mdash;As the Lion advances in years, its mane grows longer and thicker: The hair on the re&s;t of the body is &s;hort and &s;mooth, of a tawny colour, but whiti&s;h on the belly.&mdash;The roaring of the Lion is loud and dreadful; when heard in the night, it re&s;embles di&s;tant thunder; its cry of anger is much louder and &s;horter.</P>
<P>The Lion &s;eldom attacks any animal openly, except when compelled by extreme hunger: In that ca&s;e, no danger deters him: But as mo&s;t animals endeavour to avoid him, he is obliged to have recour&s;e to artifice, and take his prey by &s;urprize. For this purpo&s;e, he crouches on his belly in &s;ome thicket, where he waits till his prey approaches; and then, with one prodigious &s;pring, he leaps upon it at the di&s;tance of fifteen or twenty feet, and generally &s;eizes it at the fir&s;t bound: If he mi&s;s his object, he gives up the pur&s;uit; and, turning back to|wards the place of his ambu&s;h, he mea&s;ures the ground &s;tep by &s;tep; and again lies in wait for another opportu|nity. The lurking-place of the Lion is generally cho&s;en near a &s;pring, or by the &s;ide of a river; where he fre|quently has an opportunity of catching &s;uch animals at come to quench their thir&s;t.</P>
<P>There are, however, in&s;tances where the Lion deviates from his u&s;ual method of taking his prey; of which the following, related by Sparrman, is remarkable:&mdash;A Hot|tentot, perceiving that he was followed by a Lion, and concluding that the animal only waited the approach of night to make him his prey, began to con&s;ider the be&s;t method of providing for his &s;afety, which he at length effected in the following &s;ingular manner:&mdash;Ob&s;erving a
<PB N="168" REF="175">
piece of broken ground, with a precipitate de&s;cent on one &s;ide, he &s;at down by the edge of it; and found, to his great joy, that the Lion al&s;o made a halt, and kept at the &s;ame di&s;tance as before. As &s;oon as it grew dark, the Hottentot &s;liding gently forward, let him&s;elf down a lit|tle below the edge of the hill, and held up his cloak and hat upon his &s;tick, making at the &s;ame time a gentle mo|tion with it: The Lion, in the mean while, came creep|ing &s;oftly towards him, like a Cat; and mi&s;taking the &s;kin cloak for the man him&s;elf, made a &s;pring, and fell headlong down the precipice; by which means the poor Hottentot was &s;afely delivered from his in&s;idious enemy.</P>
<P>That the Lion does not always kill whatever animal happens to be in his power, has already been ob&s;erved; and this peculiarity in the temper of this creature is re|markably obvious, with regard to the human &s;pecies. Of this there have been many in&s;tances. At St Catherine Cree's church, Leadenhall-&s;treet, London, provi&s;ion is made, under the will of Sir John Gager, who was Lord-Mayor in the year 1646, for a &s;ermon to be annually preached on the 16th of November, in commemoration of his happy deliverance from a Lion, which he met in a de&s;ert as he was travelling in the Turki&s;h dominions, and &s;uffered him to pa&s;s unmole&s;ted. The mini&s;ter is to have 20s. for the &s;ermon, the clerk 2s. 6d. and the &s;exton 1s.: The &s;um of 8l. 16s. 6d. is likewi&s;e to be di&s;tributed among the nece&s;&s;itous inhabitants, pur&s;uant to the will of Sir John.&mdash;Sparrman, among &s;everal in|&s;tances of the &s;ame nature, mentions a per&s;on who, though he was thrown down by a Lion, and wounded by it in &s;everal places, was after all generou&s;ly left with his life.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="176">The &s;trength of this animal is great: One of them was ob&s;erved to &s;eize a heifer, which it carried off in its mouth with ea&s;e, and leaped over a ditch with her with|out much apparent difficulty.</P>
<P>At the Cape of Good Hope, the Lion is frequently hunted by the coloni&s;ts. In the day time, and upon an open plain, twelve or &s;ixteen Dogs will ea&s;ily get the bet|ter of a large Lion. As the Lion is not remarkably &s;wift, the Dogs &s;oon come pretty near him; when, with a &s;ullen kind of magnanimity, he turns round, and waits for the attack, &s;haking his mane, and roaring with a &s;hort and &s;harp tone. The hounds &s;urround him; and, ru&s;hing upon him all at once, &s;oon tear him to pieces. It is &s;aid that he has &s;eldom time to make more than two or three &s;trokes with his paws, each of which is attended with the death of one of his a&s;&s;ailants.</P>
<P>The Lione&s;s goes with young five months, and brings forth three or four at a time. The young ones are about the &s;ize of a large pug Dog, harmle&s;s, pretty, and play|ful. They continue at the teat twelve months, and are above five years in coming to perfection.</P>
<P>The Lion is a long-lived animal, although naturali&s;ts have differed greatly as to the preci&s;e period of its exi&s;|tence. Buffon limits it to twenty, or twenty-two years at mo&s;t. It is however certain, that it lives much be|yond that time. The great Lion, called Pompey, which died in the year 1760, was known to have been in the Tower above &s;eventy years; and one, brought from the river Gambia, died there not long ago at the age of &s;ix|ty-three.&mdash;Several of the&s;e animals have been bred in the Tower; &s;o that the time of their ge&s;tation, the number they produce, and the time of their arriving at perfec|tion, are all pretty well known.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="177">The attachment of the Lione&s;s to her young is re|markably &s;trong: For their &s;upport, &s;he is more fero|cious than the Lion him&s;elf, makes her incur&s;ions with greater boldne&s;s, de&s;troys, without di&s;tinction, every ani|mal that falls in her way, and carries it reeking to her cubs. She u&s;ually brings forth in the mo&s;t retired and inacce&s;&s;ible places; and when afraid of her retreat being di&s;covered, endeavours to hide her track, by bru&s;hing the ground with her tail. When much di&s;turbed or alarmed, &s;he will &s;ometimes tran&s;port her young from one place to another in her mouth; and, if ob&s;tructed in her cour&s;e, will defend them to the la&s;t extremity.</P>
<P>The fle&s;h of the Lion is &s;aid to have a &s;trong, di&s;agree|able flavour; yet it is frequently eaten by the negroes. The &s;kin, which was formerly a robe of di&s;tinction for heroes, is now made u&s;e of by tho&s;e people as a mantle or a bed. They al&s;o pre&s;erve the grea&s;e, which is of a penetrating nature, and is u&s;ed in medicine.</P>
<P>The repre&s;entation we have given, was drawn from a remarkably fine one, exhibited at Newca&s;tle in the year 1788. It was then young, exceedingly healthful, active, and in full condition.</P>

</FIGURE> THE TIGER</HEAD>
<P>is the mo&s;t rapacious and de&s;tructive of all carnivorous animals. Fierce without provocation, and cruel without nece&s;&s;ity, its thir&s;t for blood is in&s;atiable: Though glut|ted with &s;laughter, it continues its carnage, nor ever gives up &s;o long as a &s;ingle object remains in its &s;ight. Flocks and herds fall indi&s;criminate victims to its fu|ry: It fears neither the &s;ight nor the oppo&s;ition of man, whom it frequently makes its prey; and it is even &s;aid to prefer human fle&s;h to that of any other animal.</P>
<P>The Tiger is peculiar to A&s;ia; and is found as far North as China and Chine&s;e Tartary: It inhabits Mount Ararat, and Hyrcania of old, famous for its wild bea&s;ts. The greate&s;t numbers are met with in India, and its i&s;lands: They are the &s;courge of the country: They lurk among the bu&s;hes, by the &s;ides of rivers, and almo&s;t de|populate many places.&mdash;They &s;eldom pur&s;ue their prey; but bound upon it from the place of their ambu&s;h, with an ela&s;ticity, and from a di&s;tance, &s;carcely credible.&mdash;It is highly probable, that, from this circum&s;tance, the Ti|ger
<PB N="172" REF="179">
may derive its name, which, in the Armenian lan|guage, &s;ignifies an arrow; to the flight of which this creature may very properly be compared, in the quick|ne&s;s and agility of its bounds.</P>
<P>The &s;trength of this animal is &s;o great, that, when it has killed an animal, whether it be a Hor&s;e, a Buffalo, or a Deer, it carries it off with &s;uch ea&s;e, that it &s;eems no impediment to its flight. If it be undi&s;turbed, it plunges its head into the body of the animal up to its ve|ry eyes, as if to &s;atiate it&s;elf with blood.</P>
<P>The Tiger is perhaps the only animal who&s;e ferocity can never be &s;ubdued: Neither gentlene&s;s nor con&s;traint has any effect in &s;oftening its temper. It does not &s;eem &s;en&s;ible of the attention of its keeper; and would equally tear the hand that feeds, with that by which it is cha&s;|ti&s;ed.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the cruelty of this creature's di&s;po&s;i|tion, a &s;udden check has &s;ometimes had a good effect in preventing its meditated attack. Some ladies and gentle|men being on a party of plea&s;ure, under a &s;hade of trees, on the banks of a river in Bengal, were &s;uddenly &s;ur|prized at &s;eeing a Tiger ready to make its fatal &s;pring: One of the ladies, with amazing pre&s;ence of mind, laid hold of an umbrella, and unfurling it directly in the ani|mal's face, it in&s;tantly retired.&mdash;Another party had not the &s;ame good fortune. A Tiger darted among them whil&s;t they were at dinner, &s;eized on a gentleman, and carried him off in the &s;ight of his di&s;con&s;olate compani|ons.</P>
<P>They attack all kinds of animals, even the Lion; and furious combats have frequently been maintained be|tween them, in which both have peri&s;hed. Father Ta|chard
<PB N="173" REF="180">
gives an account of a battle between a Tiger and two Elephants, at Siam, of which he was an eye-wit|ne&s;s. The heads, and part of the trunks of the Ele|phants, were defended from the claws of the Tiger by a covering made for the purpo&s;e. They were placed in the mid&s;t of a large inclo&s;ure. One of them was &s;uf|fered to approach the Tiger, which was confined by cords, and received two or three heavy blows from the trunk of the Elephant upon its back, which beat it to the ground, where it lay for &s;ome time as if it were dead: But, though this attack had a good deal abated its fury, it was no &s;ooner untied, than, with a horrible roar, it made a &s;pring at the Elephant's trunk, which that animal dexterou&s;ly avoided by drawing it up; and, receiving the Tiger on its tu&s;ks, threw it up into the air. The two Elephants were then allowed to come up; and, after giving it &s;everal heavy blows, would undoubtedly have killed it, if an end had not been put to the combat.&mdash; Under &s;uch re&s;traints and di&s;advantages, we cannot won|der that the i&s;&s;ue was unfavourable to the Tiger. We may, however, judge of its exceedingly great &s;trength and fiercene&s;s,&mdash;that, after being di&s;abled by the fir&s;t attack of the Elephant, whil&s;t it was held by its cords, it would venture to continue &s;uch an unequal engagement.</P>
<P>We are happy in being able to pre&s;ent our curious readers with an engraving of this rare animal, drawn from the life, from a Tiger that was exhibited at New|ca&s;tle, in 1787; and was generally allowed to be one of the fine&s;t creatures of its kind ever &s;een in England. The beautiful bars of black with which every part of its body was &s;treaked, are accurately copied: The colour of the ground was yellow, deeper on the back, and &s;often|ing
<PB N="174" REF="181">
by degrees towards the belly, where it was white; as were al&s;o the throat and in&s;ides of the legs: A white &s;pace, &s;potted with black, &s;urrounded each eye; and on each cheek, a &s;tripe of the &s;ame colour extended from the ears to the throat. It was nearly the &s;ame height as the Lion; and was of the large&s;t &s;pecies of the Tiger, which is called the <HI>Royal Tiger.</HI> The &s;malle&s;t of them is not above two feet high, &s;aid to be extremely cunning, and delights in human fle&s;h. The &s;econd kind is about three feet high, and is fond of Deer, wild Hogs, &amp;c. which it frequently takes by the &s;ides of rivers, as they come down to quench their thir&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;kin of this animal is much e&s;teemed all over the Ea&s;t, particularly in China. The Mandarins cover their &s;eats of ju&s;tice with it; and, during the winter, u&s;e it for cu&s;hions and pillows.</P>
<P>We have now de&s;cribed the two great heads of this mi&s;chievous family, which are eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t in &s;ize, &s;trength, and colour. The three &s;ucceeding &s;pecies have been frequently confounded with each other; and, although there is &s;ome difference in their &s;ize and in the di&s;po&s;ition of their &s;pots, yet the&s;e have been &s;o indi&s;criminately defined, as to make it diffi|cult to form a true criterion, &s;o as accurately to di&s;tin|gui&s;h each &s;pecies. Strikingly &s;imilar in the form of their bodies, in the beauty of their &s;kins, as well as in their di&s;po&s;itions and habits, which &s;eem to be equally formed for rapine and cruelty; there is great room to conjecture, that commixture may be one great cau&s;e of producing the &s;light differences ob&s;ervable in the&s;e crea|tures. If we regard the figure and diver&s;ity of the &s;pots, we &s;hall find many varieties not taken notice of by na|turali&s;ts;
<PB N="175" REF="182">
if we be led to judge by the &s;ize, we &s;hall find an almo&s;t imperceptible gradation from the Cat to the Tiger. It would be vain, therefore, to make as many varieties in the&s;e animals, as we &s;ee differences in &s;pots or &s;tature: It will be &s;ufficient to point out the mo&s;t general di&s;tinctions.</P>

<P>is next in &s;ize to the Tiger; and has, by many natura|li&s;ts, been mi&s;taken for that animal.&mdash;Its hair is &s;hort and &s;mooth; and, in&s;tead of being &s;treaked like the Ti|ger, is beautifully marked on the back, &s;ides, and flanks, with black &s;pots, di&s;po&s;ed in circles, from four to five in each, with a &s;ingle &s;pot in the centre: On the face, brea&s;t, and legs, the &s;pots are &s;ingle: The colour of the body on the back and &s;ides is yellow, deep on the back, and paler towards the belly, which is white; its ears are &s;hort and pointed; its eye is re&s;tle&s;s; and its whole a&s;pect fierce and cruel.&mdash;It is an untameable animal; and inha|bits Africa, from Barbary to the remote&s;t parts of Guinea.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="183">Its manner of taking its prey is the &s;ame with that of the Tiger, always by &s;urprize, either lurking in thickets, or creeping on its belly till it comes within reach. When pre&s;&s;ed with hunger, it attacks every living crea|ture without di&s;tinction, but happily prefers the fle&s;h of brutes to that of mankind: It will even climb up trees in pur&s;uit of monkies and le&s;&s;er animals; &s;o that nothing is &s;ecure from its attacks.</P>
<P>The Panther is about the &s;ize of a large Ma&s;tiff Dog; but its legs are not quite &s;o long. Its voice is &s;trong and hoar&s;e; and it growls continually.</P>
<P>The ancients were well acquainted with the&s;e animals. The Romans drew prodigious numbers from the de&s;erts of Africa for their public &s;hews; &s;ufficient, one might &s;uppo&s;e, to have entirely exhau&s;ted them. Scaurus ex|hibited an hundred and fifty of them at one time; Pom|pey four hundred and ten; and Augu&s;tus four hundred and twenty. They probably thinned the coa&s;ts of Mau|ritania of the&s;e animals; but they &s;till &s;warm in the &s;outhern parts of Guinea.</P>
<P>In China, there is a mo&s;t beautiful animal of this kind, called <HI>Louchu;</HI> the &s;kin of which &s;ells for &s;ix pounds &s;ter|ling.&mdash;An animal of this &s;pecies is likewi&s;e found in A&s;i|atic Tartary, called there the <HI>Babr.</HI> It is &s;even feet long, extremely rapacious, and very de&s;tructive of Hor&s;es and Camels. Its &s;kin is very fine, and valued in Ru&s;&s;ia at one pound &s;terling.</P>

<P>The very trifling difference between this and the la&s;t-mentioned animal gives rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that it con|&s;i&s;ts chiefly in the name. It inhabits the &s;ame countries; and in &s;ome places goes by the &s;ame name, being called the <HI>Panther of Senegal,</HI> where it is chiefly found. It is mentioned by Ray as the female Panther; is rather &s;maller than that animal; its length, from no&s;e to tail, is about four feet; the colour of the body is a more lively yellow; and the &s;pots with which it is diver&s;ified, are &s;maller and clo&s;er than tho&s;e of the Panther.</P>
<P>The interior parts of Africa abound with the&s;e ani|mals; from whence they come down in great numbers, and make dreadful havock among the numerous herds that cover the plains of the Lower Guinea. When bea&s;ts of cha&s;e fail, they &s;pare no living creature.</P>
<P>The negroes take them in pitfalls, &s;lightly covered at the top, and baited with fle&s;h. Their chief inducement for pur&s;uing them is their fle&s;h, which they eat, and is &s;aid to be white as veal, and well ta&s;ted. The negre&s;&s;es
<PB N="178" REF="185">
make collars of their teeth, and wear them as charms, to which they attribute certain virtues.</P>
<P>The &s;kins of the&s;e animals are brought to Europe, where they are greatly e&s;teemed.</P>
<P>In India, there is a &s;pecies of this animal about the &s;ize of a large Greyhound, with a &s;mall head, and &s;hort ears; its face, chin, and throat, of a pale-brown colour, inclining to yellow; the body is of a light tawny-brown, marked with &s;mall round black &s;pots, &s;cattered over the back, &s;ides, head, and legs; the in&s;ide of the legs plain; the hair on the top of the neck is longer than the re&s;t; the belly white; the tail very long, marked on the upper &s;ide with large black &s;pots, and the hair on the under &s;ide is very long.</P>
<P>This is the animal, mentioned in our account of the Antelope, which is made u&s;e of in India for hunting that and other bea&s;ts of the cha&s;e.&mdash;It is carried in a &s;mall kind of waggon, chained and hoodwinked till it approaches the herd; when it is unchained, and &s;uffered to pur&s;ue the game. It begins by creeping along, with its belly clo&s;e to the ground, &s;topping and concealing it|&s;elf till it get an advantageous &s;ituation; it then darts on its prey with great agility, frequently making five or &s;ix amazing bounds. If it &s;hould not &s;ucceed in its fir&s;t effort, it gives up the point for that time, and readily re|turns to its ma&s;ter.</P>

<P>It is found in many parts of North-America, from Ca|nada to Florida: It is al&s;o common in Guiana, Brazil, and Mexico.</P>
<P>This animal is fierce and ravenous in the extreme, and will &s;wim rivers to attack cattle even in their inclo&s;ures.

<P>It is very de&s;tructive to dome&s;tic animals; particularly to Hogs. It preys al&s;o upon the Moo&s;e and other Deer; lies lurking upon the branch of a tree till &s;ome of the&s;e animals pa&s;s underneath, when it drops down upon one of them, and never quits its hold till it has drunk its blood.

<P>The Ocelot is not ea&s;y to be tamed, and retains its original wildne&s;s in a &s;tate of captivity. Nothing can &s;often the natural ferocity of its di&s;po&s;ition, nor calm the re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of its motions: For this rea&s;on, it is always kept in a cage.&mdash;One of the&s;e animals, &s;hewn at New|ca&s;tle in 1788, although extremely old, exhibited great marks of ferocity. It was kept clo&s;ely confined, and would not admit of being care&s;&s;ed by its keeper in the &s;ame manner as the Lion; but growled con&s;tantly, and always appeared in motion.&mdash;A male and female Ocelot were brought to France &s;ome years ago, which had been taken when very young. At the age of three months,
<PB N="186" REF="193">
they became &s;o &s;trong and fierce, as to kill a bitch that was given them for a nur&s;e. When a live Cat was thrown to them, they &s;ucked its blood, but would not ta&s;te its fle&s;h. The male &s;eemed to have a great &s;upe|riority over the female, as he never allowed her to par|take till his own appetite was &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>The female Ocelot, like all the larger animals of the Cat kind, produces a &s;mall number at a time. The two above mentioned were the only young ones found with the mother, which was killed at the time they were taken; and makes it probable, that they bring forth only that number.</P>

<P>It is common in Guiana, Brazil, and various parts of South-America.&mdash;It is called the <HI>Cayenne Cat;</HI> and is not &s;o frequent in temperate as in warm climates.</P>
<P>In taking a &s;urvey of this beautiful race of animals, we are unavoidably led to ob&s;erve, that much remains for the laborious re&s;earches of the natural hi&s;torian, before a complete account can be made out of the various kinds of which it is compo&s;ed. Several &s;pecies are frequently found in the Ea&s;t-Indies, in the woods near the Cape of Good Hope, and in the continent of America; but in general the&s;e have been &s;o negligently, or &s;o injudiciou&s;ly mentioned, as to render it impo&s;&s;ible to form a perfect de&s;cription of them.&mdash;A good hi&s;tory of the&s;e animals is one of the many de&s;iderata of the naturali&s;t; but when we con&s;ider the great di&s;tance which mo&s;t of this fero|cious tribe ob&s;erve in their &s;eparation from mankind, and the dangers that mu&s;t be encountered in approaching their &s;olitary habitations, we are obliged to lament that this de&s;irable object is not likely to be &s;oon accompli&s;hed.</P>

<P>This beautiful animal inhabits the mountainous parts of India; and is called by the natives of Malabar the <HI>Marapute.</HI>&mdash;It is larger than the Wild Cat. Its general colour is a pale-yellow; white on the brea&s;t and belly, variegated with round &s;pots, which are equally di&s;tri|buted over every part of its body: Its eyes are extremely brilliant, and have a wild, piercing look; its whi&s;kers are long and &s;tiff; its tail &s;hort; and its feet are armed with long hooked claws.</P>
<P>This creature is &s;eldom to be &s;een upon the ground; but lives chiefly in trees, where it makes its ne&s;t, and breeds its young. It feeds on young birds, and leaps with great agility from tree to tree. It is extremely fierce; but avoids mankind, unle&s;s provoked; when it darts furiou&s;ly upon the offender, and tears and bites nearly in the &s;ame manner as the Panther.</P>
<P>Sparrman mentions an animal of this kind, found at
<PB N="189" REF="196">
the Cape of Good Hope, which he calls the <HI>Tiger Cat,</HI> and &s;uppo&s;es to be the &s;ame with the Serval. The &s;ame author mentions another animal of this kind, called at the Cape the <HI>Wild Red Cat;</HI> the &s;kin of which is &s;up|po&s;ed by the natives to po&s;&s;e&s;s great medicinal powers, and give ea&s;e to per&s;ons afflicted with the gout, lumba|go, and pains in the joints. The hairy &s;ide mu&s;t be worn next the part affected. The fur of this animal is very fine and &s;oft; and probably, there are many other &s;kins, which, if applied with an equal degree of good faith, might have the &s;ame &s;alutary effects.</P>
<P>The colour of the upper part of this creature is of a very bright-red; towards the &s;ides it is mixed with white and grey; the belly is white; the upper part of the ears, which have tufts of hair on their tips, is dark-brown, &s;prinkled with grey. The body of this animal is long, and about two feet in height.</P>

</FIGURE> THE WILD CAT.</HEAD>
<P>The hi&s;tory of this animal is &s;o intimately connected with that of the common or dome&s;tic kind, that we &s;hall
<PB N="190" REF="197">
include our account of both under one general head, and de&s;cribe them as con&s;tituting the &s;ame &s;pecies.</P>
<P>The dome&s;tic Cat, if &s;uffered to e&s;cape into the woods, becomes wild, and lives on &s;mall birds and &s;uch other game as it can find there. It likewi&s;e breeds with the wild one. It is no uncommon thing for females of the tame &s;pecies to quit their hou&s;es during the time they are in &s;ea&s;on, go in que&s;t of male Wild Cats, and return home to the &s;ame habitations impregnated by them. It is by this means, that &s;ome of our dome&s;tic Cats &s;o per|fectly re&s;emble tho&s;e of the wild breed.</P>
<P>The hair of the Wild Cat is &s;oft and fine, of a pale-yellow colour, mixed with grey; a du&s;ky li&s;t runs along the middle of the back, from head to tail; the &s;ides are &s;treaked with grey, pointing from the back downwards; the tail is thick, and marked with alternate bars of black and white. It is larger and &s;tronger than the tame Cat, and its fur much longer.</P>
<P>This animal inhabits the mo&s;t mountainous and woody parts of this i&s;land, living in trees, and hunting for birds and &s;mall animals, &s;uch as rabbits, hares, rats, mice, moles, &amp;c. It frequently makes great havock among poultry; will even kill young lambs, kids, and fawns; and is the fierce&s;t and mo&s;t de&s;tructive bea&s;t of prey in this kingdom.</P>
<P>It is taken either in traps, or by &s;hooting. There is frequently danger in the latter mode; for if it be only &s;lightly wounded, it will attack the per&s;on who has in|jured it, and in that ca&s;e is not ea&s;ily repelled.</P>
<P>Wild Cats are found, with very little variety, in almo&s;t every climate. They exi&s;ted in America before its di&s;co|very by the Europeans. One of them was brought to
<PB N="191" REF="198">
Columbus, which was of the ordinary &s;ize, of a brown|i&s;h-grey colour, with a long tail.&mdash;They are common in many places of A&s;ia and Africa. Sparrman gives a de|&s;cription of one which he &s;hot at the Cape, which was in every re&s;pect &s;imilar to tho&s;e of this country. It was of a grey colour; and mea&s;ured, from the no&s;e to the tail, nearly twenty-two inches. The tail was thirteen inches long. Its height was about a foot and a half. Its inte&s;|tines were full of moles and rats.</P>
<P>Some Wild Cats have been taken in this kingdom of a mo&s;t enormous &s;ize; we recollect one having been killed in the county of Cumberland, which mea&s;ured, from its no&s;e to the end of its tail, upwards of five feet.</P>
<P>The province of Chorazan, in Per&s;ia, is particularly famous for a mo&s;t beautiful Cat, about the &s;ize of the tame one, of a fine grey colour, without any mixture, and as &s;oft and &s;hining as &s;ilk. It is darker on the back, &s;oftening by degrees towards the brea&s;t and belly, where it is almo&s;t white. The tail is long, and covered with hair, five or &s;ix inches in length. The animal frequent|ly turns it upon its back, like a &s;quirrel; the point of it re&s;embling a plume of feathers.</P>
<P>The Cat of Angora differs greatly from the Wild Cat, in having much longer hair, e&s;pecially about the neck, where it forms a fine ruff, and gives the creature a Lion-like appearance. Some of the&s;e are of a &s;ilvery white|ne&s;s, and &s;ilky texture; others are of a dun colour, mix|ed with yellow.</P>

</FIGURE> THE DOMESTIC CAT</HEAD>
<P>may be &s;aid to be only a variety of the Wild Cat, the principal difference being in its &s;ize, which is le&s;s; and, in&s;tead of being uniformly the &s;ame, is di&s;tingui&s;hed by an infinite variety of &s;hades and colouring.</P>
<P>To de&s;cribe an animal &s;o well known might &s;eem a &s;uperfluous ta&s;k; we &s;hall only, therefore, &s;elect &s;uch of its peculiarities as are lea&s;t obvious, and may have e&s;ca|ped the notice of inattentive ob&s;ervers.</P>
<P>It is generally remarked, that Cats can &s;ee in the dark; but, though this is not ab&s;olutely the ca&s;e, yet it is cer|tain that they can &s;ee with much le&s;s light than mo&s;t other animals, owing to the peculiar &s;tructure of their eyes, the pupils of which are capable of being contracted or dilated in proportion to the degree of light by which they are affected. The pupil of the Cat, during the day, is perpetually contracted; and it is with difficulty that it can &s;ee by a &s;trong light: But in the twilight, the pupil
<PB N="193" REF="200">
re&s;umes its natural roundne&s;s, the animal enjoys perfect vi&s;ion, and takes advantage of this &s;uperiority to di&s;cover and &s;urprize its prey.</P>
<P>The cry of the Cat is loud, piercing, and clamorous; and whether expre&s;&s;ive of anger or of love, is equally vi|olent and hideous. Its call may be heard at a great di&s;|tance; and is &s;o well known to the whole fraternity, that on &s;ome occa&s;ions &s;everal hundred Cats have been brought together from different parts. Invited by the piercing cries of di&s;tre&s;s from a &s;uffering fellow-creature, they a&s;&s;emble in crowds; and, with loud &s;qualls and yells, expre&s;s their horrid &s;ympathies. They frequently tear the mi&s;erable object to pieces; and, with the mo&s;t blind and furious rage, fall upon each other, killing and wounding indi&s;criminately, till there is &s;carcely one left. The&s;e terrible conflicts happen only in the night; and, though very rare, in&s;tances of very furious ones are well authenticated.</P>
<P>The Cat is particularly aver&s;e to water, cold, and bad &s;mells. It is fond of certain perfumes; but is more particularly attracted by the &s;mell of valerian, marum, and cat-mint. It rubs it&s;elf again&s;t them; and, if not prevented from coming at them in a garden where they are planted, would infallibly de&s;troy them.</P>
<P>The Cat brings forth twice, and &s;ometimes thrice, a year. The period of her ge&s;tation is fifty-five or fifty-&s;ix days; and &s;he generally produces five or &s;ix at one litter. She conceals her kittens from the male, le&s;t he &s;hould devour them, as he is &s;ometimes inclined; and, if appre|hen&s;ive of being di&s;turbed, will take them up in her mouth, and remove them one by one to a more &s;ecure retreat. Even the female her&s;elf, contrary to the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
<PB N="194" REF="201">
law of Nature, which binds the parent to its off|&s;pring by an almo&s;t indi&s;&s;oluble tie, is &s;ometimes known to eat her own young the moment after &s;he has produced them.</P>
<P>Though extremely u&s;eful in de&s;troying the vermin that infe&s;t our hou&s;es, the Cat &s;eems little attached to the per&s;ons of tho&s;e that afford it protection. It &s;eems to be under no &s;ubjection, and acts only for it&s;elf: All its news are confined to the place where it has been brought up; if carried el&s;ewhere, it &s;eems lo&s;t and bewildered: Neither care&s;&s;es nor attention can reconcile it to its new &s;ituation; and it frequently takes the fir&s;t opportunity of e&s;caping to its former haunts. Frequent in&s;tances are in our recollection, of Cats having returned to the place from whence they had been carried, though at many miles di&s;tance, and even acro&s;s rivers, when they could not po&s;&s;ibly have any knowledge of the road or &s;ituation that would apparently lead them to it.&mdash;This extraordi|nary faculty is, however, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in a much greater de|gree by Dogs; yet it is in both animals equally wonder|ful and unaccountable.</P>
<P>In the time of Hoel the Good, king of Wales, who died in the year 948, laws were made as well to pre|&s;erve, as to fix the different prices of animals; among which the Cat was included, as being at that period of great importance, on account of its &s;carcity and utility. The price of a kitten before it could &s;ee was fixed at one penny; till proof could be given of its having caught a mou&s;e, two-pence; after which it was rated at four-pence, which was a great &s;um in tho&s;e days, when the value of &s;pecie was extremely high. It was likewi&s;e re|quired, that it &s;hould be perfect in its &s;en&s;es of hearing
<PB N="195" REF="202">
and &s;eeing, &s;hould be a good mou&s;er, have its claws whole, and, if a female, be a careful nur&s;e: If it failed in any of the&s;e good qualities, the &s;eller was to forfeit to the buyer the third part of its value.&mdash;If any one &s;hould &s;teal or kill the Cat that guarded the Prince's granary, he was either to forfeit a milch ewe, her fleece, and lamb, or as much wheat as, when poured on the Cat &s;u&s;pended by its tail, (its head touching the floor) would form a heap high enough to cover the tip of the former.&mdash; From hence we may conclude, that Cats were not ori|ginally natives of the&s;e i&s;lands; and, from the great care taken to improve and pre&s;erve the breed of this prolific creature, we may &s;uppo&s;e were but little known at that period.&mdash;Whatever credit we may allow to the circum|&s;tances of the well-known &s;tory of Whittington and his Cat, it is another proof of the great value &s;et upon this animal in former times.</P>

</FIGURE> THE LYNX</HEAD>
<P>differs greatly from every animal of the Cat kind we have hitherto de&s;cribed. Its ears are long and erect, tufted at the end with long black hairs, by which this &s;pecies of animals is peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;hed: The hair on the body is long and &s;oft, of a red-a&s;h colour, marked with du&s;ky &s;pots, which differ according to the age of the creature; &s;ometimes they are &s;carcely vi&s;ible: Its legs and feet are very thick and &s;trong; its tail &s;hort, and black at the extremity; its eyes are of a pale-yellow colour; and its a&s;pect &s;ofter and le&s;s ferocious than that of the Panther or the Ounce. The &s;kin of the male is more &s;potted than that of the female.</P>
<P>The fur of this creature is valuable for its &s;oftne&s;s and warmth; and is imported in great quantities from Ame|rica and the North of Europe. The farther North they are taken, the whiter they are, and the &s;pots more di&s;|tinct. The mo&s;t elegant of tho&s;e is called the <HI>Irbys;</HI> and is taken near lake Balka&s;h, in U&s;bec Tartary. Its &s;kin
<PB N="197" REF="204">
&s;ells in that country for one pound &s;terling.&mdash;The colour of its hair changes with the climate and the &s;ea&s;on: The winter furs are richer and more beautiful than tho&s;e taken in &s;ummer.</P>
<P>The Lynx is &s;aid to be very long-lived, is a very de|&s;tructive animal, lives by hunting, and pur&s;ues its prey to the tops of the highe&s;t trees. It feeds on Wea&s;els, Ermines, Squirrels, &amp;c. which are unable to e&s;cape it. It watches the approach of the Fallow-deer, Hare, and other animals; and darts upon them from the branches of trees, where it lies concealed; &s;eizes the animals by the throat, and drinks their blood; after which, it aban|dons them, and goes in que&s;t of fre&s;h game.&mdash;Its &s;ight is remarkably quick; and it &s;ees its prey at a great di&s;tance. &mdash;It often eats no more of a Sheep or a Goat than the brain, the liver, and the inte&s;tines. It will &s;ometimes dig under the doors to gain admi&s;&s;ion into the &s;heepfold. &mdash;When attacked by a Dog, it lies down on its back, &s;trikes de&s;perately with its claws, and frequently obliges its a&s;&s;ailant to retreat.</P>
<P>Although the Lynx has nothing in common with the Wolf, it has been di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>Lupus-Cervarius,</HI> or the <HI>Stag-Wolf.</HI> Its manner of howling is &s;imilar to that of the Wolf; and when heard at a di&s;|tance, is not ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from the cry of that ani|mal. The epithet <HI>cervarius</HI> has been added, becau&s;e its &s;kin is variegated with &s;pots like that of a young Stag.</P>
<P>A variety of this animal is found in the inner parts of the province of New York. It is called the <HI>Bay Lynx,</HI> and is about twice the &s;ize of a large Cat. Its hair is &s;hort and &s;mooth; its general colour is a bright-bay, ob|&s;curely marked with du&s;ky &s;pots; on its face there are
<PB N="198" REF="205">
black &s;tripes, pointing downward towards the no&s;e; on each &s;ide of the upper lip it has three rows of &s;mall black &s;pots, with long whi&s;kers i&s;&s;uing from them; each cheek is marked with long black &s;tripes, of a circular form, proceeding from the corners of the eyes; the under part of the body, and in&s;ides of the legs, are white; the in|&s;ide of each fore leg is marked on the upper part with two black bars; its tail, which is &s;hort, is marked with bars of a du&s;ky colour, and at the end with one of a deep-black; the tip and under &s;ide are white.</P>
<P>The Lynxes of our days mu&s;t be very different ani|mals from tho&s;e which have been de&s;cribed by poets as drawing the chariot of Bacchus; for, be&s;ide the imprac|ticability of training the&s;e animals to the yoke, we find, that the Lynx is not an inhabitant of India, or of any of the warmer countries of A&s;ia conquered by that hero. It prefers cold to even temperate climates; and is com|mon in the fore&s;ts of the northern parts of Europe, A&s;ia, and America.</P>
<P>The ancients &s;eem to have given the name of <HI>Lynx</HI> to an animal which exi&s;ted only in imagination, and may be ranked with their other ideal mon&s;ters and prodigies &mdash;the Sphynx, the Pega&s;us, and the Unicorn.&mdash;Its &s;ight was &s;aid to penetrate the mo&s;t opaque bodies, and its urine to be converted into a precious &s;tone.</P>

</FIGURE> THE CARACAL</HEAD>
<P>re&s;embles the Lynx in &s;ize, figure, and a&s;pect, as well as in having its ears tipt with a pencil of black hairs.&mdash;It differs from the la&s;t-mentioned animal in not being &s;pot|ted; its hair is rougher, and of a pale reddi&s;h-brown; its tail is longer, and of an uniform colour; its face is more lengthened, its look more fierce, and its nature and di&s;po&s;ition more &s;avage.</P>
<P>This animal is found only in warm climates; and is common in Per&s;ia, India, Barbary, and in all the coun|tries inhabited by the Lion, the Panther, and the Ounce. &mdash;It is called in Per&s;ia the <HI>Syah-Gu&s;h;</HI> and in the Turk|i&s;h language, the <HI>Karrah-Kulak:</HI> Both the&s;e names &s;ig|nify the <HI>Cat with black Ears.</HI>&mdash;It is &s;aid to follow the Lion, and to feed on the remains which that animal leaves of his prey; for which rea&s;on it is called among the Arabs the <HI>Lion's Guide.</HI></P>
<P>The Caracal is about the &s;ize of a Fox; but much
<PB N="200" REF="207">
&s;tronger, and more ferocious. It has been known to at|tack a Hound, and in&s;tantly tear it to pieces.</P>
<P>This animal is extremely difficult to tame; but when taken young, and reared with great caution, it may be trained to the cha&s;e.</P>
<P>It is u&s;ed in pur&s;uing the &s;maller &s;ort of animals, in which it is very &s;ucce&s;sful; but it is active only in the pur&s;uit of animals that are too feeble for re&s;i&s;tance, or too timid to exert their powers. Whenever it meets with one that is &s;uperior to it in &s;trength, it lo&s;es its courage, and gives up the cha&s;e.&mdash;It is likewi&s;e employ|ed in catching birds; &s;uch as cranes, pelicans, peacocks, &amp;c.; which it &s;urpri&s;es with &s;ingular addre&s;s. When it has &s;eized its prey, it holds it fa&s;t in its mouth, and lies upon it for &s;ome time quite motionle&s;s.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome varieties in this animal. The face of the Nubian Caracal is rounder; the ears black on the out&s;ide, inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;ilver-coloured hairs; on the brea&s;t, belly, and in&s;ides of the thighs, there are &s;mall bright-yellow &s;pots; and it has the mule cro&s;s on the withers, like mo&s;t of the Barbary Caracals.&mdash;In Lybia, there are Caracals with white ears, tufted at the end with thin black hairs; they have white tails, the extre|mities of which are &s;urrounded with four black rings; and on the hind part of each leg, there are four black &s;pots. They are &s;maller than the other Caracals, not exceeding the &s;ize of a dome&s;tic Cat.</P>
<P>We have now gone through all the principal varieties which con&s;titute this numerous race; in all of which, as has been already ob&s;erved, from the Lion to the com|mon Cat, we may perceive a &s;triking &s;imilitude in di&s;po|&s;ition, form, and manners. This agreement is likewi&s;e
<PB N="201" REF="208">
ob&s;ervable in their internal conformation, which is &s;till more exact,&mdash;in the &s;hortne&s;s of their inte&s;tines, the &s;harpne&s;s and number of their teeth, and in the &s;tructure of their feet and claws. They are all equally carnivo|rous; and tear, rather than chew their meat. They eat &s;lowly; and growl whil&s;t they feed, as if afraid of lo&s;ing their prey. They are all cowardly, and &s;eldom make an attack but where conque&s;t is certain.</P>
<P>Animals of this race may be con&s;idered as the mo&s;t formidable enemies of mankind. There are others more powerful; but their di&s;po&s;itions are milder; and they &s;el|dom offend till they find them&s;elves injured: Others are more numerous; but they are weaker, and find their &s;afety not in oppo&s;ing, but in flying from man. The&s;e are the only quadrupeds that in any degree make good their ground again&s;t him, and maintain a kind of divided &s;way over many fair and fertile tracts, that &s;eem, in other re&s;pects, formed for the comfort and convenience of &s;ocial life.</P>

<HEAD>ANIMALS OF THE WEASEL KIND.</HEAD>
<P>THESE little, active, and enterprizing animals are particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed from other carnivorous kinds, by the length and &s;lenderne&s;s of their bodies, which are admirably adapted to their manner of living, and methods of taking their prey. They are &s;o &s;mall and flexible, as to wind like worms into very &s;mall cre|vices and openings; whither they ea&s;ily follow the little animals that &s;erve them for food.</P>
<P>All the animals of this kind are furni&s;hed with &s;mall glands, placed near the anus, from which an unctuous matter continually exudes: The effluvia of it is ex|tremely offen&s;ive in the Polecat, Ferret, Wea&s;el, Badger, &amp;c; but in the Civet Cat, Martin, and Pine Wea&s;el, it is an agreeable perfume. They are all equally marked for rapine and cruelty: They &s;ub&s;i&s;t only by theft; and find their chief protection in their minutene&s;s. They are all, from the &s;hortne&s;s of their legs, &s;low in pur&s;uit; and make up that deficiency by patience, a&s;&s;iduity, and cunning.&mdash;As their prey is precarious, they can live a long time without food. When they fall in with plenty, they immediately kill every thing within their reach be|fore they begin to &s;atisfy their appetite; and always &s;uck the blood of every animal they kill, before they eat any of its fle&s;h.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the principal peculiarities common to this kind; all the &s;pecies of which have &s;o &s;triking a re&s;em|blance to each other, that having &s;een one, we may form a very ju&s;t idea of all the re&s;t.</P>

</FIGURE> THE WEASEL.</HEAD>
<P>THE length of this animal does not exceed &s;even inches, from the no&s;e to the tail; which is only two inches and a half long, and ends in a point: Its height is not above two inches and a half; &s;o that it is nearly five times as long as it is high.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t prevailing colour of the Wea&s;el is a pale reddi&s;h-brown on the back, &s;ides, and legs; the throat and belly are white; beneath the corners of the mouth, on each jaw, is a &s;pot of brown. It has whi&s;kers like a Cat; its ears are large, and have a fold at the lower part, that gives them the appearance of being double; its eyes are &s;mall, round, and black; its teeth are thirty-two in number, and extremely &s;harp.</P>
<P>The Wea&s;el is very common, and well known in mo&s;t parts of this country; is very de&s;tructive to young birds, poultry, rabbits, &amp;c.; and is a keen devourer of eggs, which it &s;ucks with great avidity. It will follow a Hare, which is terrified into a &s;tate of ab&s;olute imbecility at the &s;ight of this little animal, and gives it&s;elf up to it with|out
<PB N="204" REF="211">
re&s;i&s;tance, making at the &s;ame time the mo&s;t piteous outcries.</P>
<P>The bite of the Wea&s;el is generally fatal. It &s;eizes its prey near the head, and fixes its &s;harp teeth into a vital part. A Hare, Rabbit, or any other &s;mall animal, bit in this manner, is never known to recover; but lingers for &s;ome time, and dies. The wound is &s;o &s;mall, that the place where the teeth enter can &s;carcely be perceived. &mdash;It is remarkably active; and will run up the &s;ides of a wall with &s;uch facility, that no place is &s;ecure from it.</P>
<P>This creature is a friend to the farmer, and much en|couraged by him. During winter, it frequents his barns, out-hou&s;es, and granaries; which it effectually clears of Rats and Mice. It is, indeed, a more deadly enemy to them than even the Cat it&s;elf; for, being more active and &s;lender, it pur&s;ues them into their holes, and kills them after a &s;hort re&s;i&s;tance. It creeps al&s;o into pigeon holes, and de&s;troys the young ones; catches &s;parrows, and all kinds of &s;mall birds; and when it has brought forth its young, it hunts with &s;till greater boldne&s;s and avidity.&mdash;In &s;ummer, it ventures at a di&s;tance from its u&s;ual haunts; is frequently found by the &s;ide of waters, near corn-mills; and is almo&s;t &s;ure to follow wherever a &s;warm of Rats has taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any place.</P>
<P>The evening is the time when this animal begins its depredations. Towards the clo&s;e of the day, it may fre|quently be &s;een &s;tealing from its hole, and creeping about the farmer's yard in &s;earch of its prey. If it enter the place where poultry are kept, it &s;eldom attacks the cocks or the old hens, but always aims at the young ones. It does not eat its prey on the &s;pot where it has killed it; but, where it is not too large, carries it away to its re|treat.
<PB N="205" REF="212">
It al&s;o breaks and &s;ucks all the eggs it can meet with; and, not unfrequently, kills the hen that attempts to defend them.</P>
<P>The Wea&s;el is a wild and untractable little animal: When kept in a cage for the purpo&s;e of amu&s;ement or in&s;pection, it &s;eems in a continual &s;tate of agitation, is terrified at the &s;ight of every per&s;on that approaches to look at it, and hides it&s;elf in the wool or hay which is given to it for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>It conveys all its food to its hiding-place; and will not touch it till it begin to putrefy. It pa&s;&s;es the greate&s;t part of the day in &s;leeping; and u&s;ually employs the night in exerci&s;e and eating.</P>
<P>The female brings forth in the &s;pring, and generally produces four or five at one litter. She prepares a bed for them of &s;traw, leaves, and mo&s;s. The young are brought forth blind; but very &s;oon acquire &s;trength enough to follow their dam, and a&s;&s;i&s;t in her excur&s;ions. They will attack &s;erpents, water-rats, moles, field-mice, &amp;c.: They overrun the meadows; and frequently kill the partridges, and &s;uck their eggs.</P>
<P>The motion of the Wea&s;el con&s;i&s;ts of unequal and pre|cipitant leaps; and in climbing a tree, it makes a con&s;i|derable &s;pring of &s;ome feet from the ground. It jumps in the &s;ame manner upon its prey; and being extremely limber, evades the attempts of much &s;tronger animals to &s;eize it.&mdash;We are told, that an eagle having &s;eized a Wea&s;el, mounted into the air with it; and was &s;oon af|ter ob&s;erved to be in great di&s;tre&s;s. Its little enemy had extricated it&s;elf &s;o far, as to be able to bite it &s;everely in the throat; which pre&s;ently brought the eagle to the ground, and gave the Wea&s;el an opportunity of e&s;ca|ping.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="213">Notwith&s;tanding the wildne&s;s of this animal's nature, there are not wanting in&s;tances to prove, that it is capa|ble of being thoroughly tamed. M. Buffon, who a&s;&s;ert|ed the impo&s;&s;ibility of bringing the Wea&s;el into any de|gree of &s;ubjection, is afterwards corrected by a lady; who a&s;&s;ures him, that &s;he had tried the experiment upon a young Wea&s;el taken in her garden; which &s;oon learned to recognize and lick the hand from which it received its food, and became as familiar, care&s;&s;ing, and frolic&s;ome, as a Dog or a Squirrel.&mdash;The &s;ame author mentions ano|ther experiment made by a gentleman, who trained a young Wea&s;el &s;o completely, that the animal followed him wherever he went.&mdash;The method of taming them is to &s;troke them gently over the back; and to threaten, and even to beat them, when they bite.</P>
<P>The&s;e facts may &s;erve to &s;hew the po&s;&s;ibility of ren|dering this animal dome&s;tic; and hold out a u&s;eful hint to us, that its &s;ervices might be very great in clearing &s;hips, granaries, and other places, from the vermin with which they are frequently infe&s;ted: For it is very well known, that one of the&s;e animals will kill more Rats and Mice than any Cat, being better able to pur&s;ue them into their holes and lurking-places.</P>
<P>The odour of the Wea&s;el is very &s;trong, e&s;pecially in the &s;ummer time, or when it is irritated or pur&s;ued; it is then intolerable, and may be &s;melt at &s;ome di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The following circum&s;tance, related by Buffon, will &s;hew, that this animal has a natural attachment to every thing that is corrupt:&mdash;A Wea&s;el was taken in his neigh|bourhood, with three young ones, out of the carca&s;e of a Wolf that had been hung on a tree by the hind feet. The Wolf was almo&s;t entirely putrefied; and the Wea&s;el
<PB N="207" REF="214">
had made a ne&s;t of leaves and herbage for her young in the thorax of the putrid carca&s;e.</P>

<P>The difference in &s;hape between this animal and the Wea&s;el is &s;o &s;mall, that they have frequently been de|&s;cribed under the &s;ame denomination; the &s;mall Stoat being &s;ometimes mi&s;taken for a Wea&s;el.&mdash;The length of the former is about ten inches; the tail five inches and a half, very hairy; and tipt with black at the end; the edges of the ears, and the ends of the toes, are of a yellowi&s;h-white: In other re&s;pects, it perfectly re&s;em|bles the Wea&s;el in colour as well as form.</P>
<P>In the mo&s;t northern parts of Europe, this animal re|gularly changes its colour in winter, and becomes per|fectly white; except the end of the tail, which remains invariably black. It is then called the <HI>Ermine;</HI> and is much &s;ought after for its valuable fur, which makes a
<PB N="208" REF="215">
con&s;iderable article of commerce in Norway, Lapland, Ru&s;&s;ia, and other cold countries; where they are found in prodigious numbers. They are al&s;o very common in Kamt&s;chatka and Siberia, where they are taken in traps baited with fle&s;h. The &s;kins are &s;old in the country for from two to three pounds &s;terling per hundred.&mdash;In Nor|way, they are either &s;hot with blunt arrows, or taken in traps made of two flat &s;tones, one being propped up with a &s;tick, to which is fa&s;tened a baited &s;tring; and as &s;oon as the animal begins to nibble, the &s;tone falls down, and cru&s;hes it to death.&mdash;The Stoat is likewi&s;e found white in the winter time in Great-Britain, and is then erroneou&s;ly called a <HI>White Wea&s;el.</HI> Its fur, however, among us, is of little value, having neither the thickne&s;s, the clo&s;ene&s;s, nor the whitene&s;s, of tho&s;e which come from Siberia.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e animals, that we had in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, had entirely a&s;&s;umed its winter robe; but with a con&s;i|derable mixture of yellow, e&s;pecially on the top of the head and back.&mdash;They begin to change from brown to white in November, and re&s;ume their &s;ummer ve&s;ture in March.</P>
<P>The natural hi&s;tory of this animal is much the &s;ame with that of the Wea&s;el; its food being young birds, rabbits, mice, &amp;c.; its agility the &s;ame; and its &s;cent equally fetid.</P>

</FIGURE> THE FERRET.</HEAD>
<P>This animal is only known to us in a kind of dome&s;tic &s;tate. It is originally a native of Africa; from whence, according to Strabo, it was brought into Spain; and, from its known enmity to the Rabbit, was made u&s;e of to reduce the numbers of them with which that kingdom abounded. It has &s;ince been employed for the &s;ame pur|po&s;e in various parts of Europe; but as it is not able to bear the &s;everity of a cold climate, it cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t with|out great care and &s;helter. It is u&s;ually kept in a box, with wool; of which it makes it&s;elf a warm bed. It &s;leeps a great part of the day, and the moment it a|wakes, &s;eems eager for its food, which is commonly bread and milk.</P>
<P>The Ferret breeds twice a year. The female goes &s;ix weeks with young. Some of them devour their offspring as &s;oon as they are brought forth; when they immediate|ly come in &s;ea&s;on again, and have three litters, which generally con&s;i&s;t of five or &s;ix, but &s;ometimes &s;even or eight, and even nine.&mdash;It is apt to degenerate in this
<PB N="210" REF="217">
country, and lo&s;e in &s;ome degree its ferocity. Warren|ers are therefore obliged to procure an intercour&s;e be|tween the female and the Foumart. The produce is a breed of a much darker colour than the Ferret, partaking more of that of the Foumart.</P>
<P>The length of this animal is about fourteen inches; that of the tail five; its no&s;e is &s;harper than that of the Wea&s;el or the Foumart; its ears are round; and its eyes red and fiery: The colour of the whole body is a very pale-yellow.</P>
<P>The Ferret is naturally &s;uch an enemy to the Rabbit, that if a dead Rabbit be laid before a young Ferret, it in&s;tantly &s;eizes upon it, although it has never &s;een one before. If a living Rabbit be pre&s;ented to it, the Ferret is &s;till more eager, &s;eizes it by the neck, winds it&s;elf round it, and continues to &s;uck its blood till it be &s;a|tiated.&mdash;When employed in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the warren, it mu&s;t be muzzled, that it may not kill the Rabbits in their holes; but only oblige them to come out, that the warrener may catch them in his nets. If the Ferret be &s;uffered to go in without a muzzle, or &s;hould di&s;engage it&s;elf from it whil&s;t in the hole, there is great danger of lo&s;ing it; for after &s;atisfying it&s;elf with blood, it falls a&s;leep, and it is then almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to come at it.&mdash; The mo&s;t u&s;ual methods of recovering the Ferret are, by digging it out, or &s;moking the hole. If the&s;e do not &s;ucceed, it continues during the &s;ummer among the Rab|bit holes, and lives upon the prey it finds there; but being unable to endure the cold of the winter, is &s;ure to peri&s;h.</P>
<P>The Ferret, though ea&s;ily tamed, is &s;oon irritated.&mdash; Its odour is fetid; its nature voracious; it is tame with|out
<PB N="211" REF="218">
attachment; and &s;uch is its appetite for blood, that it has been known to attack and kill children in the cra|dle.&mdash;When angry, it is apt to bite; and the wound is difficult to cure.</P>
<P>The <HI>Madaga&s;car Wea&s;el,</HI> or <HI>Van&s;ire</HI> of M. Buffon, may be referred to this &s;pecies; to which its &s;ize and form are &s;trikingly &s;imilar. It is about fourteen inches in length: The hair is of a dark-brown colour, mixed with black: It differs from the Ferret in the number of its grinding teeth, which amount to twelve; whereas, in the Ferret, there are but eight: The tail is longer than that of the Ferret, and better furni&s;hed with hair.</P>
<P>The &s;ame author mentions another animal of this &s;pe|cies under the name of the <HI>Nems,</HI> which is a native of Arabia. It re&s;embles our Ferret in every thing but the colour, which is that of a dark-brown mixed with white; the belly is of a bright-yellow colour, without any mix|ture; the prevailing colour on the head and round the eyes is a clear yellow; on the no&s;e, cheeks, and other parts of the face where the hair is &s;hort, a tincture of brown more or le&s;s prevails, and terminates gradually above the eyes; the legs are covered with &s;hort hair, of a deep-yellow colour; on each foot there are four toes, and a &s;mall one behind; the claws are &s;mall and black; the tail, which is more than double the length of that of our Ferret, is very thick at its origin, terminates in a point, and is covered with long hair, &s;imilar to that on the body.</P>

<P>&s;o called from its offen&s;ive &s;mell, as well as to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the Martin, to which it bears a &s;trong re&s;em|blance: It is likewi&s;e called the <HI>Polecat</HI> or <HI>Fitchet,</HI> and is the <HI>Putois</HI> of M. Buffon, and the <HI>Putorius</HI> of Ray.</P>
<P>The length of this animal is about &s;eventeen inches, exclu&s;ive of the tail, which is &s;ix inches long; the ears are &s;hort, broad, and tipt with white on their edges; it is white about the mouth; the re&s;t of the body is for the mo&s;t part of a deep-chocolate colour; the &s;ides are co|vered with hairs of two colours, the ends being dark like the re&s;t of the body, and the middle of a full-tawny co|lour.</P>
<P>The &s;hape of this animal, like all others of this genus, is long and &s;lender, the no&s;e &s;harp-pointed, and the legs &s;hort; the toes are long, and the claws &s;harp. It is in every re&s;pect admirably formed for that peculiar mode of life a&s;&s;igned to it by the all-wi&s;e Author of Nature.</P>
<P>It is a very active and nimble little animal, runs very
<PB N="213" REF="220">
fa&s;t, and will creep up the &s;ides of walls with great agi|lity. In running, its belly &s;eems to touch the ground; in preparing to jump, it arches its back, and makes its &s;pring with great force.</P>
<P>It is very de&s;tructive to poultry, pigeons, and young game of all kinds: It makes great havock among&s;t Rab|bits; and its thir&s;t for blood is &s;o great, that it kills ma|ny more than it can eat. One or two of the&s;e animals will almo&s;t de&s;troy a whole warren.&mdash;It generally re&s;ides in woods or thick brakes; where it burrows under ground, forming a &s;hallow retreat about two yards in length, which commonly ends among the roots of trees.</P>
<P>In the winter &s;ea&s;on, this creature frequents hou&s;es, barns, &amp;c. feeding on poultry, eggs, and &s;ometimes milk: But it has another mode of procuring &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, which has hitherto e&s;caped the ob&s;ervation of the naturali&s;t; and which, though &s;ingular, we can vouch for the truth of:&mdash;During a &s;evere &s;torm, one of the&s;e animals was traced in the &s;now from the &s;ide of a rivulet to its hole, at &s;ome di&s;tance from it: As it was ob&s;erved to have made frequent trips, and as other marks were to be &s;een in the &s;now which could not ea&s;ily be accounted for, it was thought a matter worthy of more diligent enquiry: Its hole was accordingly examined, the Foumart taken, and eleven fine eels were di&s;covered to be the fruits of this curious little animal's nocturnal excur&s;ions. The marks in the &s;now were found to have been made by the motion of the eels in the creature's mouth.</P>
<P>From the above curious circum&s;tance, we have given a repre&s;entation of this animal (which was drawn from the life) in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this &s;ingular booty.&mdash;It may be matter of curious inve&s;tigation for &s;ome future naturali&s;t
<PB N="214" REF="221">
to enquire by what arts this wily animal finds a booty &s;o apparently difficult to attain: Whether by plunging in, and dragging it from its rece&s;&s;es at the bottoms of rivers; or in the more &s;ecure method of taking advantage of the labours of others, and robbing the Otter of its &s;tores.</P>
<P>In attending to the in&s;tinctive faculties of animals, there is room for deep and diligent enquiry; and, though our progre&s;s is liable to many interruptions, it is a de|lightful ta&s;k to follow the workings of Nature through all her intricate and curious windings: Every &s;tep we gain is a &s;ufficient reward for our trouble, and leads us to admire the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of that Di&s;pen&s;ation which furni&s;hes every creature with &s;ufficient and ample powers to admini&s;ter to all its wants, nece&s;&s;ities, and comforts.</P>
<P>The female Foumart brings forth in the &s;ummer, ge|nerally five or &s;ix at a time. She &s;uckles them but a &s;hort time, and accu&s;toms them early to live upon blood and eggs.</P>
<P>Though the &s;mell of this animal is rank and di&s;agreea|ble even to a proverb, yet the &s;kin is dre&s;t with the hair on, and u&s;ed as other furs, without retaining its offen|&s;ive odour.</P>
<P>The Foumart is a very fierce and bold little creature: When attacked by a Dog, it will defend it&s;elf with great &s;pirit, attack in its turn, and fa&s;ten upon the no&s;e of its enemy with &s;o keen a bite, as frequently to oblige him to de&s;i&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>THE MARTIN</HEAD>
<P>is much more common in this country than the Pine Wea&s;el.&mdash;It lives wholly in woods, and breeds in the hollows of trees. It produces from four to &s;ix young ones at a time.</P>
<P>This animal is the mo&s;t beautiful of all the Wea&s;el kind. Its head is &s;mall, and elegantly formed; its eyes are lively; and its motions quick and graceful&mdash;When taken young, it is ea&s;ily tamed, extremely playful, and good-humoured. Its attachment, however, is not to be depended upon. It readily takes advantage of the fir&s;t opportunity to regain its liberty, and retire to the woods, its natural haunts.</P>
<P>The food of the Martin is much the &s;ame with other animals of its kind. It makes ince&s;&s;ant war with Rats, Mice, and other vermin: Poultry, game, and &s;mall birds, are its con&s;tant prey: It feeds al&s;o on grain, and is ex|tremely fond of honey.</P>
<P>M. Buffon tells us of one of the&s;e animals that he had tamed, which, he remarks, drank frequently. It &s;ome|times &s;lept two days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and at other times would continue awake as long. In preparing it&s;elf for &s;leep, it folded it&s;elf up in a round form, and covered its head with its tail. When awake, its motions were &s;o vi|olent, &s;o con&s;tant, and &s;o trouble&s;ome, that it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to keep it chained. From the flexibility of its body, it ea&s;ily eluded its fetters; and, after returning once or twice, at la&s;t ab&s;ented it&s;elf entirely.</P>

<P>The &s;kin and excrements of this animal have an agree|able mu&s;ky &s;cent, and are entirely free from that rank|ne&s;s which is &s;o di&s;gu&s;ting in other animals of this kind. Its fur is valuable, and in high e&s;timation.</P>

<P>The darke&s;t furs are the mo&s;t valuable. A &s;ingle &s;kin, though not above four inches broad, is &s;ometimes va|lued as high as fifteen pounds. The &s;able differs from all other furs in this, that the hair turns with equal ea&s;e to either &s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="225">The Sable re&s;embles the Martin in form, and is about the &s;ame &s;ize.&mdash;It lives in holes in the earth, by the banks of rivers, and under the roots of trees.

<P>This animal is very lively and active, and will leap with great agility from tree to tree, in pur&s;uit of &s;mall birds, woodcocks, &s;quirrels, &amp;c. It likewi&s;e lives upon rats, fi&s;hes, pine tops, and wild fruits.</P>
<P>It is affirmed by naturali&s;ts, that the Sable is not a|ver&s;e to the water; and, from the finene&s;s and clo&s;ene&s;s of its fur, there is great rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that it is much accu&s;tomed to that element; from which it al&s;o derives a part of its &s;ub&s;i&s;tence: And as a farther proof that this animal is in &s;ome degree amphibious, we are told by tra|vellers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Avril's Travels, p. 140.</NOTE>, that it is very numerous in &s;mall i&s;lands, where the hunters go in que&s;t of them.&mdash;It is mentioned by Ari&s;totle as a water animal, and is de&s;cribed by him un|der the name of <HI>Satherius.</HI></P>

<PB N="219" REF="226">
the allotted number; and this, in a few years, amounts to a con&s;iderable premium.&mdash;The hunters form them|&s;elves into &s;mall troops, each of which is directed by a leader of their own chu&s;ing.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on of hunting is from November to February; for at that time the Sables are in the highe&s;t perfection: Tho&s;e caught at any other time of the year are full of &s;hort hairs, and are &s;old at inferior prices. The be&s;t &s;kins are &s;uch as have only long hair, which is always black, and of a glo&s;&s;y brightne&s;s. Old furs do not re|tain their glo&s;s.&mdash;Both the Ru&s;&s;ians and Chine&s;e have a method of dying their furs; but the dyed &s;ables are ea&s;i|ly di&s;covered, having neither the &s;moothne&s;s nor the brightne&s;s of the natural hair.</P>
<P>The bellies of Sables, which are &s;old in pairs, are about two fingers in breadth, and are tied together in bundles of forty pieces, which are &s;old at from one to two pounds &s;terling. The tails are &s;old by the hundred, from four to eight pounds.</P>
<P>There are in&s;tances of Sables being found of a &s;nowy whitene&s;s; but they are rare, and bought only as curi|o&s;ities.</P>
<P>The hunters of this animal are frequently obliged to endure the utmo&s;t extremity of cold and hunger in the pur&s;uit of their booty. They penetrate deep into im|men&s;e woods, where they have no other method of find|ing their way back but by marking the trees as they ad|vance: If this &s;hould by any means fail them, they are inevitably lo&s;t. They &s;ometimes trace the Sables on the new-fallen &s;now to their holes, place their nets at the entrance, and wait frequently two or three days before the animal comes out.&mdash;It has happened, by the failure
<PB N="220" REF="227">
of their provi&s;ions, that the&s;e poor wretches have been reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of tying thin boards tight to their &s;tomachs to prevent the cravings of appetite&mdash;Such are the hard&s;hips our fellow-creatures undergo to &s;upply the wants of the vain and luxuriant!</P>
<P>An animal, &s;imilar to the Sable, is mentioned by Mr Pennant under the name of the <HI>Fi&s;her.</HI> It is found in North-America; and, by the number of its &s;kins im|ported, mu&s;t be very numerous there, nearly &s;ix hun|dred of them having been brought in one &s;ea&s;on from New-York and Pen&s;ylvania. The hair on the body is mo&s;tly black; the &s;ides brown; the ears are broad and round, du&s;ky on their out&s;ides, and edged with white; the face and &s;ides of the neck pale-brown, mixed with black; the feet are very broad, and covered with hair, even on their &s;oles; the tail is full and bu&s;hy; the length of the animal, from no&s;e to tail, is twenty-eight inches; the tail &s;eventeen.</P>

<P>This animal, in Egypt, is dome&s;tic, like the Cat; and is retained by the natives for the &s;ame u&s;eful purpo&s;es of clearing their hou&s;es of Rats and Mice.&mdash;With all the
<PB N="221" REF="228">
&s;trength and agility of the Cat, it has a more general appetite for carnage. It attacks, without dread, the mo&s;t deadly &s;erpents, and preys on every noxious rep|tile of the torrid zone, which it &s;eizes and kills with great avidity.&mdash;It is &s;aid, that when this animal is wounded by a &s;erpent, and begins to feel the effect of the poi&s;on, it immediately has recour&s;e to a certain root, which the Indians call after its name, and a&s;&s;ert that it is an antidote for the bite of any venomous reptile.</P>
<P>The Ichneumon is the mo&s;t formidable enemy of the crocodile: It de&s;troys its eggs, which it digs out of the &s;and, where they are laid to hatch by the heat of the &s;un; and kills great numbers of the young crocodiles &s;oon af|ter their production, before they are able to reach the water. It was for this rea&s;on that the ancient Egyptians wor&s;hipped this animal, and ranked the Ichneumon a|mong&s;t tho&s;e deities that were mo&s;t propitious to them.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals, in their dome&s;tic &s;tate, are perfectly tame and gentle. M. d'Ob&s;onville &s;peaks of one which he reared from a young one. It became tamer than a Cat, was obedient to the call of its ma&s;ter, and followed him wherever he went. One day he brought a &s;mall water-&s;erpent alive, being de&s;irous to know how far its in&s;tinct would carry it again&s;t a being with whom it was hitherto entirely unacquainted. Its fir&s;t emotion &s;eemed to be a&s;toni&s;hment mixed with anger: Its hair became erect: In an in&s;tant, it &s;lipped behind the reptile; and, with remarkable &s;wiftne&s;s and agility, leaped upon its head, &s;eized it, and cru&s;hed it with its teeth. This fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay &s;eemed to have awakened in it its natural appetite for blood, which till then had given way to the gentle|ne&s;s of its education: It no longer &s;uffered the poultry,
<PB N="222" REF="229">
among which it was brought up, to pa&s;s unregarded; but took the fir&s;t opportunity, when it was alone, to &s;trangle them. It eat a part of their fle&s;h, and drank only the blood of others.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals are numerous in all the &s;outhern regions of A&s;ia, from Egypt to the i&s;land of Java: They are al&s;o found in Africa, in the country about the Cape of Good Hope. They frequent the banks of rivers, are fond of fi&s;h, are &s;aid to take the water like an Otter, and will continue in it a con&s;iderable time without ri&s;ing to take breath.</P>
<P>The Ichneumon varies in &s;ize. The dome&s;tic kind is generally larger than tho&s;e that are wild, and its colours more variegated. It is in general about the &s;ize of a common Cat; &s;omewhat longer in the body, and &s;horter in the legs. Its fur contains tints of white, brown, fawn-colour, and a dirty &s;ilver-grey, which all together form a mixture very agreeable to the eye.&mdash;Its form is like that of the Polecat. Its eyes are &s;mall, but inflamed, and &s;parkle with a &s;ingular vivacity; its no&s;e is long and &s;len|der; its ears &s;mall, rounded, and almo&s;t naked; its tail is very thick at the ba&s;e, and tapers to a point; under|neath the tail is an orifice, from which a mo&s;t fetid hu|mour is &s;ecreted; its claws are long.&mdash;It darts upon its prey like an arrow, and &s;eizes it with inevitable certain|ty.</P>
<P>This creature has a &s;mall &s;oft voice, &s;omewhat like a murmur; and, unle&s;s &s;truck or irritated, never exerts it. When it &s;leeps, it folds it&s;elf up like a ball, and is not ea&s;ily awaked. It frequently &s;its up like a Squirrel, and feeds it&s;elf with its fore feet; catches any thing that is thrown to it; and will often feign it&s;elf dead till its prey come within its reach.</P>

<P>This animal, which is called the <HI>Chinche</HI> by the na|tives of Brazil, is about the &s;ize of a common Cat. Its no&s;e is long and &s;lender, and extends a con&s;iderable way beyond the lower jaw; its ears are large, &s;hort, and rounded; a white &s;tripe extends from the no&s;e over the forehead and along the back, where it is inter&s;ected with a &s;mall line of black, commencing at the tail, and ex|tending upwards along the middle of the back; its belly and legs are black; its hair is long, e&s;pecially on the tail, which is thick and bu&s;hy.</P>
<P>This creature inhabits Peru and other parts of South-America, and is remarkable above all the Wea&s;el kind for a mo&s;t intolerable, &s;uffocating, fetid vapour, which it emits from behind, when attacked, pur&s;ued, or frighten|ed. The &s;tench of this effluvia is in&s;upportable, and is the creature's be&s;t means of defence.</P>
<P>There are three or four varieties of this animal, men|tioned by M. Buffon under the name of the <HI>Stinking Pole|cats;</HI> all of which po&s;&s;e&s;s this wonderful faculty of an|noying their enemies from the &s;ame quarter.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="232">Some turn their tail to their pur&s;uers, and emit a mo&s;t horrible &s;tench, which keeps both dogs and men at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance: Others eject their urine to the di&s;|tance of about eighteen feet; and it is of &s;o virulent a quality, as almo&s;t to occa&s;ion blindne&s;s, if any of it &s;hould happen to fall into the eyes. Clothes infected with it, retain the &s;mell for many days: No wa&s;hing can make them &s;weet; but they mu&s;t be even buried in fre&s;h &s;oil before they can be thoroughly clean&s;ed. Dogs that are not properly bred, turn back as &s;oon as they perceive the &s;mell: Tho&s;e that have been accu&s;tomed to it, will kill the animal; but are obliged to relieve them&s;elves by thru&s;ting their no&s;es into the ground.</P>
<P>The <HI>Stifling,</HI> or <HI>Squa&s;h,</HI> which is the &s;econd variety of this animal, is nearly of the &s;ame &s;ize with the Skunk. Its hair is long, and of a deep-brown colour. It lives in holes and clefts of rocks, where the female brings forth her young. It is a native of Mexico; and feeds on bee|tles, worms, and &s;mall birds. It de&s;troys poultry, of which it only eats the brains.&mdash;When afraid or irritated, it voids the &s;ame offen&s;ive kind of odour, which no crea|ture dare venture to approach. Profe&s;&s;or Kalm was in danger of being &s;uffocated by one that was pur&s;ued into a hou&s;e where he &s;lept; and it affected the cattle &s;o much, that they bellowed through pain. Another, which was killed by a maid &s;ervant in a cellar, &s;o affected her with its &s;tench, that &s;he lay ill for &s;everal days; all the pro|vi&s;ions that were in the place were &s;o tainted by the &s;mell, as to be utterly unfit for u&s;e.</P>
<P>Another variety of this animal is called the <HI>Conepate;</HI> and is, perhaps, no more than the female of the la&s;t-mentioned animal It is &s;omewhat &s;maller, and differs
<PB N="226" REF="233">
chiefly from the Squa&s;h in being marked with five pa|rallel white lines, which run along its back and &s;ides from head to tail. It is a native of North-America.&mdash; When attacked, it bri&s;tles up its hair, throws it&s;elf into a round form, and emits an odour which no creature can &s;upport.</P>
<P>The la&s;t of this pe&s;tiferous family which we &s;hall men|tion is the <HI>Zorilla.</HI> This animal is a native of New-Spain, where it is called the <HI>Mariputa.</HI> It is found on the banks of the river Oronoque; and is, perhaps, the mo&s;t beautiful, and at the &s;ame time the mo&s;t offen&s;ive, of all creatures. Its body is beautifully marked with white &s;tripes upon a black ground, running from the head to the middle of the back; from whence they are cro&s;&s;ed with other white bands, which cover the lower part of the back and flanks: Its tail is long and bu&s;hy, black as far as the middle, and white to its extremity. It is an active and mi&s;chievous little animal. Its &s;tench is &s;aid to extend to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance; and is &s;o powerful, as to overcome even the Panther of America, which is one of its greate&s;t enemies.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this offen&s;ive quality in the&s;e animals, they are frequently tamed, and will follow their ma&s;ter like dome&s;tic animals. They do not emit their odour, unle&s;s when beaten or irritated. They are frequently killed by the native Indians, who immediately cut away the noxious glands; thereby preventing the fle&s;h, which is good eating, from being infected. Its ta&s;te is &s;aid nearly to re&s;emble the flavour of that of a young pig. The &s;avage Indians make pur&s;es of their &s;kins, which are held in no e&s;timation by the Europeans.</P>

<P>The body of the Genet is longer than that of the Mar|tin; its head is long and &s;lender, with a &s;harp muzzle; its ears are a little pointed; its hair &s;oft, &s;mooth, and &s;hining, of a tawny-red colour, &s;potted with black; a|long the ridge of the back there is a kind of mane of long hair, which forms a black line from head to tail; the &s;pots on the &s;ides are round and di&s;tinct, tho&s;e on the back almo&s;t clo&s;e; its tail is long, and marked with &s;even or eight rings of black. From an orifice beneath its tail, it yields a kind of perfume which &s;mells faintly of mu&s;k.</P>
<P>This creature is found in Turkey, Syria, and Spain. We are told by Belon, that he &s;aw Genets in the hou&s;es at Con&s;tantinople as tame as Cats; and that they were u&s;eful to the inhabitants in de&s;troying rats, mice, and other vermin.</P>
<P>It is a mo&s;t beautiful, cleanly, and indu&s;trious animal, and very active in pur&s;uing its prey. Its nature is mild and gentle; its colours beautifully variegated; and its

</FIGURE> THE CIVET</HEAD>
<P>is larger than the Genet, and yields a perfume in much greater quantities, and of a &s;tronger quality.</P>
<P>Though originally a native of the warm climates of Africa or A&s;ia, this creature can live in temperate, and even in cold countries; but it mu&s;t be fed with nouri&s;h|ing diet, and carefully defended again&s;t the &s;everities of the weather. Numbers of them are kept in Holland for the purpo&s;e of collecting this valuable perfume. The ci|vet procured at Am&s;terdam is more e&s;teemed than that which comes from the Levant or India, being le&s;s adul|terated. To collect this perfume, the animal is put in|to a cage, &s;o narrow that it cannot turn it&s;elf: The cage is opened at one end, and the animal drawn backwards by the tail, and &s;ecurely held by its hind legs: A &s;mall &s;poon is then introduced into the pouch which contains the perfume, with which it is carefully &s;craped, and the matter put into a ve&s;&s;el properly &s;ecured. This operation
<PB N="229" REF="236">
is performed two or three times a week.&mdash;The quantity of odorous humour depends much on the quality of the nouri&s;hment, and the appetite of the animal, which al|ways produces more in proportion to the goodne&s;s of its food. Boiled fle&s;h, eggs, rice, &s;mall animals, birds, and particularly fi&s;h, are the kinds of food the Civet mo&s;tly delights in; and the&s;e ought to be varied, &s;o as to excite its appetite, and pre&s;erve its health.&mdash;It requires very lit|tle water; and, though it drinks &s;eldom, it di&s;charges its urine frequently. It is &s;omewhat remarkable, that in this operation the male is not to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the female.&mdash;From this circum&s;tance, it has been &s;up|po&s;ed that this animal was the <HI>Hyena</HI> of the ancients; and it is certain, that mo&s;t of the fables related concern|ing that mon&s;ter are in a certain way applicable to the Civet.&mdash;The ancients were well acquainted with the po|matum of the Civet, and a&s;cribed to it certain powers of exciting love; for which purpo&s;e it &s;till con&s;titutes one of the luxuries of the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>What has been fabulou&s;ly related concerning the un|certainty of &s;ex in the Hyena, applies much more &s;trong|ly to the Civet; for in the male nothing appears exter|nally but three apertures, &s;o perfectly &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the female, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;ex otherwi&s;e than by di&s;&s;ection.</P>
<P>The perfume of this animal is &s;o &s;trong, that it infects every part of its body: The hair and the &s;kin are &s;o tho|roughly penetrated with it, that they retain it long after being taken from the body of the animal. If a per&s;on be &s;hut up in the &s;ame apartment, it is almo&s;t in&s;upport|able; and when heated with rage, it becomes &s;till more pungent.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="237">The Civet is naturally &s;avage, and &s;omewhat fero|cious; yet it is ea&s;ily tamed, &s;o as to be handled with|out danger.</P>
<P>The teeth of this creature are &s;trong and &s;harp; but its claws are weak. It is an active and nimble animal. It leaps like a Cat, and runs with great &s;wiftne&s;s. It lives by hunting; &s;urprizes &s;mall animals and birds; and, like the Wea&s;el, will &s;ometimes &s;teal into the yard, and carry off poultry.&mdash;Its eyes &s;hine in the dark; and it is probable, that it can &s;ee well enough to pur&s;ue its prey during the night, as it is known to be mo&s;t active at that time.</P>
<P>The Civet is very prolific in its native climate; but, though it lives and produces its perfume in temperate regions, it is never known to breed there.&mdash;Its voice is &s;tronger than that of the Cat, and has &s;ome re&s;em|blance to the cry of an enraged Dog.</P>

It is fre|quently a&s;&s;i&s;ted in di&s;covering its delicious booty by a bird called the Honey Guide, <HI>(cuculus indicator)</HI> which is extremely fond both of honey and the eggs of bees; and in the pur&s;uit of its food, excites the attention of the Ratel by a loud grating cry of <HI>cherr, cherr, cherr;</HI> at

the &s;ame time flying &s;lowly on towards the place where the &s;warm of bees have taken up their abode. The Ra|tel follows the &s;ound with great attention; and having plundered the ne&s;t, leaves &s;ufficient behind it as a reward for the &s;ervices of its faithful guide. The Ratel is well adapted to this purpo&s;e, as the toughne&s;s and thickne&s;s of its &s;kin effectually defends it from the &s;tings of the bees: On this account it is extremely difficult to kill this animal; for its &s;kin is &s;o loo&s;ely attached to its body, that when &s;eized by a hound it gives way, and the ani|mal has an opportunity of turning round, and biting its affailant, which it frequently does &s;o &s;everely, as to oblige him to de&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>The Ratel, according to Mr Pennant, is two feet long from the no&s;e to the tail, which is eight inches; its legs are &s;hort; on each foot it has four toes, armed with long claws; tho&s;e on the fore feet are above an inch long, and very &s;harp; its tongue is rough; it has no ear-laps; the orifice of the ear is wide, and &s;urround|ed by a callous rim; a broad &s;tripe, of an a&s;h colour, ex|tends along the back from the forehead to the tail, which is &s;eparated from the black hair on the &s;ides and belly by a light grey li&s;t running from behind each ear to the tail. &mdash;It burrows in holes under ground, is &s;aid to be ve|ry fetid, and is called the <HI>Stinking Badger</HI> by M. de la Caille.</P>

It de|fended it&s;elf with great force whenever any per&s;on at|tempted to lay hold of it contrary to its inclination; and it &s;tuck fa&s;t to the legs of tho&s;e with whom it was fami|liar, when it wanted to ran&s;ack their pockets, and carry off any thing that it found in them. It had an extreme aver&s;ion to hog's bri&s;tles; and the &s;malle&s;t bru&s;h made it de&s;i&s;t.&mdash;Its mode of living was very &s;ingular: It &s;lept
<PB N="236" REF="243">
from midnight till noon, kept awake the re&s;t of the day, and uniformly walked about from &s;ix in the evening till midnight, without the lea&s;t regard to the weather. This is probably the time a&s;&s;igned by Nature to this &s;pecies of animals for procuring their food, which con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of young birds, eggs, and &s;mall animals.</P>
<P>This creature inhabits Brazil and Guiana, runs up trees very nimbly, eats like a Dog, and holds its food between its fore legs like the Bear. The Coati &s;tands with ea&s;e on its hind feet. It is &s;aid to gnaw its own tail, which it generally carries erect, and &s;weeps it about from &s;ide to &s;ide.</P>

<P>is very common in the warm regions of America: It is found al&s;o in the mountains of Jamaica; from whence great numbers of them frequently de&s;cend into the plan|tations, and make great havock among the &s;ugar-canes, of which they are particularly fond. The planters con|&s;ider the&s;e animals as their greate&s;t enemies, as they frequently do infinite mi&s;chief in one night's excur&s;ion.
<PB N="237" REF="244">
They have contrived various methods of de&s;troying them; yet &s;till they propagate in &s;uch numbers, that neither traps nor fire-arms can repel them.</P>
<P>The Racoon is &s;omewhat le&s;s than the Badger: Its head re&s;embles that of a Fox; but its ears are round, and much &s;horter; and its upper jaw very pointed, and lon|ger than the lower: Its eyes, which are large, are &s;ur|rounded with two broad patches of black; its body is thick and &s;hort, covered with long hair, black at the points, and grey underneath; its tail is long and bu&s;hy, and marked with alternate rings of black and white; its feet and toes are black.</P>
<P>The Racoon is a very active and nimble animal. Its claws, which are extremely &s;harp, enable it to climb trees with great facility. It moves forward chiefly by bounding; and, though it proceeds in an oblique direc|tion, runs with great &s;wiftne&s;s.&mdash;When tamed, it is ve|ry good-natured and &s;portive; but it is almo&s;t con&s;tantly in motion, and as unlucky and inqui&s;itive as a Monkey, examining every thing with its paws, which it makes u&s;e of as hands to lay hold of any thing that is given it, and to carry its meat to its mouth. It &s;its up to eat, is extremely fond of &s;weet things and &s;trong liquors, with which it will get exce&s;&s;ively drunk. It has all the cunning of the Fox, is very de&s;tructive to poultry; but will eat all &s;orts of fruits, grain, and roots. It has a pe|culiar method of dipping every thing in water it intends to eat, and will &s;eldom ta&s;te bread till it be well &s;oaked. It opens oy&s;ters with a&s;toni&s;hing dexterity, &s;eparates the &s;hells, and leaves not a ve&s;tige of the fi&s;h. It does this without looking at the oy&s;ter; but places it under its hind paws, and with its &s;ore feet &s;earches for the weake&s;t
<PB N="238" REF="245">
part, where it fixes its claws, forces it open, and &s;natches out the fi&s;h. It likewi&s;e devours all kinds of in&s;ects; delights in hunting &s;piders; and when at liberty in a garden, will eat gra&s;shoppers, &s;nails, worms, &amp;c. It is a very cleanly animal, and always retires to obey the calls of Nature. It is familiar, and even care&s;&s;ing, leaps upon tho&s;e it is fond of, plays &s;portively, and moves about with great agility.</P>
<P>This animal is hunted for its &s;kin, which is next in value to that of the Beaver for making hats.</P>

</FIGURE> THE BADGER.</HEAD>
<P>Although Nature has furni&s;hed this animal with for|midable weapons of offence, and has be&s;ides given it &s;trength &s;ufficient to u&s;e them with great effect, it is, notwith&s;tanding, a harmle&s;s and inoffen&s;ive creature; and, unle&s;s attacked, employs them only for its &s;upport and comfort.</P>
<P>This animal retires to the mo&s;t &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es; where it digs its hole, and forms its habitation under ground.&mdash; Its food con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of roots, fruits, gra&s;s, in&s;ects, and
<PB N="239" REF="246">
frogs. It is charged with de&s;troying lambs and rabbits; but there &s;eems to be no other rea&s;on to con&s;ider it as a bea&s;t of prey, than the analogy between its teeth and tho&s;e of carnivorous animals.</P>
<P>Few creatures defend them&s;elves better, or bite with greater keenne&s;s, than the Badger. On that account it is frequently baited with Dogs trained for that purpo&s;e. This inhuman diver&s;ion is chiefly confined to the indo|lent and the vicious, who take a cruel plea&s;ure in &s;eeing this harmle&s;s animal &s;urrounded by its enemies, and de|fending it&s;elf from their attacks, which it does with a&s;to|ni&s;hing agility and &s;ucce&s;s. Its motions are &s;o quick, that a Dog is frequently de&s;perately wounded in the fir&s;t moment of a&s;&s;ault, and obliged to fly. The thickne&s;s of the Badger's &s;kin, and the length and coar&s;ene&s;s of its hair, are an excellent defence again&s;t the bites of the Dogs: Its &s;kin is &s;o loo&s;e, as to re&s;i&s;t the impre&s;&s;ions of their teeth; and give the animal an opportunity of turn|ing it&s;elf round, and wounding its adver&s;aries in their tendere&s;t parts. In this manner this &s;ingular creature is able to re&s;i&s;t repeated attacks both of men and dogs, from all quarters, till, being overpowered with numbers, and enfeebled by many de&s;perate wounds, it is at la&s;t obliged to &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>The Badger is an indolent animal, and &s;leeps much; it confines it&s;elf to its hole during the whole day, and feeds only in the night; it is &s;o cleanly, as never to de|file its habitation with its ordure; it breeds only once in a year, and brings forth four or five at a time.</P>
<P>This animal is not known to exi&s;t in warm countries. It is an original native of the temperate climates of Eu|rope; and is found without any variety in Spain, France, Italy, Germany, Britain, Poland, and Sweden.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="247">The u&s;ual length of the Badger is &s;omewhat above two feet, exclu&s;ive of the tail, which is about &s;ix inches long; its eyes are &s;mall, and are placed in a black &s;tripe, which begins behind the ears, and runs tapering toward the no&s;e; the throat and legs are black; the back, &s;ides, and tail, are of a dirty-grey, mixed with black; the legs and feet are very &s;hort, &s;trong, and thick; each foot con|&s;i&s;ts of five toes; tho&s;e on the fore feet are armed with &s;trong claws, well adapted for digging its &s;ubterranean habitations.</P>
<P>In walking, the Badger treads on its whole heel, like the Bear; which brings its belly very near the ground.</P>
<P>Immediately below the tail, between that and the anus, there is a narrow tran&s;ver&s;e orifice, from whence a white &s;ub&s;tance, of a very fetid &s;mell, con&s;tantly ex|udes.</P>
<P>The &s;kin of this creature, when dre&s;&s;ed with the hair on, is u&s;ed for pi&s;tol furniture.&mdash;Its fle&s;h is eaten; the hind quarters are &s;ometimes made into hams, which, when cured, are not inferior in goodne&s;s to the be&s;t ba|con.&mdash;The hairs are made into bru&s;hes, which are u&s;ed by painters to &s;often and harmonize their &s;hades.

<P>The colour of this animal is a yellowi&s;h-white; its eyes are &s;mall; and its head thicker than that of the common Badger: Its legs are &s;hort; and on each foot there are four toes, armed with &s;harp white claws.</P>

</FIGURE> THE WOLVERENE, OR GLUTTON.</HEAD>
<P>This voracious animal is found in all the countries bordering on the Northern Ocean, both in Europe and A&s;ia: It is likewi&s;e common in Canada, the country about Hud&s;on's Bay, and other parts of North-America; where it is known by the name of the <HI>Carcajou.</HI></P>
<P>This creature has been variou&s;ly de&s;cribed by natu|rali&s;ts. We have &s;elected the account given by M. Buf|fon, which was taken from a living animal in his po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion. Its length, from the no&s;e to the in&s;ertion of the tail, was two feet two inches; the tail was eight inches long; the length of the fore legs was eleven inches, and the hind one foot; it had five toes on each foot, armed with long &s;harp claws; the middle claw of the fore foot was one inch and a half long; the muzzle, as far as the eye-brows, was black; its eyes were &s;mall and black, and its ears &s;hort; its brea&s;t and under jaw were &s;potted with white; the back, legs, belly, and tail, were black.&mdash;Dur|ing its confinement, this animal did not di&s;cover any &s;ymptoms of great ferocity. It eat voraciou&s;ly; and af|ter a full meal, covered it&s;elf in its cage with &s;traw. It eat no bread; but would devour more than four pounds
<PB N="243" REF="250">
of fle&s;h every day, which it &s;wallowed greedily, almo&s;t without chewing.</P>
<P>In a &s;tate of liberty, this creature is &s;aid to lead a life of continual rapine. It lurks in the branches of trees, in order to &s;urprize Deer and other animals that pa&s;s under them. It waits with great patience the arrival of its prey, and darts from its hiding-place with unerring cer|tainty. In this manner it indi&s;criminately &s;urprizes the Hor&s;e, the Elk, the Stag, or the Rein-deer; and fixes it&s;elf between their &s;houlders with its teeth and claws.&mdash; The wild Rein-deer, which are numerous both in Lap|land and North-America, frequently fall victims to the Glutton. When &s;eized by this blood-thir&s;ty animal, it is in vain that the wounded Deer endeavours to di&s;en|gage it&s;elf from its enemy by ru&s;tling among the bran|ches of the trees: No force can oblige it to quit its hold: It maintains its po&s;ition, and continues to &s;uck the blood of the flying animal till it falls down exhau&s;ted with pain and fatigue: It then devours the carca&s;e with in&s;atiable voracity, and gorges it&s;elf with the fle&s;h till it is almo&s;t in danger of bur&s;ting.</P>
<P>The motions of the Glutton are &s;low. There are few quadrupeds that cannot e&s;cape from it, except the Bea|ver, which it frequently pur&s;ues and overtakes.&mdash;In America, it is called the <HI>Beaver-eater.</HI>&mdash;It &s;ometimes lies in wait, and &s;urprizes tho&s;e animals coming out of their burrow; or breaks into their habitation, and kills great numbers of them.</P>
<P>The Glutton often defeats the labours of the hunt&s;|men by &s;tealing away the Sables and other animals that have been caught in their traps; and it is &s;ometimes taken in the &s;nares laid for the&s;e animals. When attack|ed,
<PB N="244" REF="251">
it makes a &s;trong re&s;i&s;tance: It will tear the &s;tock from the gun, if it &s;hould catch hold of it with its teeth; or break the trap in pieces in which it is caught. Not|with&s;tanding its fiercene&s;s, it is capable of being tamed, and of learning &s;everal entertaining tricks.&mdash;It is hunt|ed only for its &s;kin, which is very valuable, of a mo&s;t beautiful glo&s;&s;y black, which &s;hines with a peculiar lu&s;|tre, and reflects the light like dama&s;k &s;ilk.&mdash;The &s;kins are &s;old in Siberia at five or &s;ix &s;hillings each, at Jakut&s;k at twelve, and &s;till dearer in Kamt&s;chatka; where the women dre&s;s their hair with its white paws, which they e&s;teem a great ornament.&mdash;The furs of this animal, from the North of Europe and A&s;ia, are infinitely finer, blacker, and more glo&s;&s;y, than tho&s;e of the American kind.</P>

</FIGURE> THE BROWN BEAR.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are two kinds of this animal,&mdash;the <HI>Land</HI> and the <HI>Sea Bear.</HI> The&s;e are very different, as well in the formation of their bodies, as in their habits and di&s;po&s;itions.</P>
<P>There are two varieties of the land Bear,&mdash;the <HI>Brown</HI> and the <HI>Black.</HI> The former is found in almo&s;t every cli|mate, the black Bear chiefly in the fore&s;ts of the nor|thern regions of Europe and America.</P>
<P>The brown Bear is &s;ometimes carnivorous, and will de&s;troy cattle, and eat carrion; but its general food is roots, fruits, and vegetables.&mdash;It is a &s;avage and &s;olitary animal, lives in de&s;ert and unfrequented places, and chu&s;es its den in the mo&s;t gloomy and retired parts of the fore&s;t, or in the mo&s;t dangerous and inacce&s;&s;ible pre|cipices of unfrequented mountains. It retires alone to its den about the end of autumn, (at which time it is exceedingly fat) and lives for &s;everal weeks in a &s;tate of total inactivity and ab&s;tinence from food.&mdash;During this time, the female brings forth her young, and &s;uckles
<PB N="246" REF="253">
them. She chu&s;es her retreat for that purpo&s;e in the mo&s;t retired places, apart from the male, le&s;t he &s;hould devour them. She makes a warm bed for her young, and attends them with unremitting care during four months; and in all that time, &s;he &s;carcely allows her|&s;elf any nouri&s;hment. She brings forth two, and &s;ome|times three young at a time.&mdash;The cubs are round and &s;hapele&s;s, with pointed muzzles; but they are not lick|ed into form by the female, as Pliny and other ancient naturali&s;ts &s;uppo&s;ed. At fir&s;t they do not exceed eight inches in length; they are blind during the fir&s;t four weeks, are of a pale-yellow colour, and have &s;carcely any re&s;emblance of the creature when arrived at matu|rity.&mdash;The time of ge&s;tation in the&s;e animals is about &s;ix months; and they bring forth in the beginning of Janu|ary.</P>
<P>In the &s;pring, the old Bears, attended by their young, come out from their retreats, lean, and almo&s;t fami&s;hed by their long confinement. They then ran&s;ack every quarter in &s;earch of food. They frequently climb trees, and devour the fruit in great quantities; particularly the date-plumb tree, of which they are exceedingly fond. They a&s;cend the&s;e trees with &s;urprizing agility, keep them&s;elves firm on the branches with one paw, and with the other collect the fruit.</P>
<P>The Bear is remarkably fond of honey, which it will encounter great difficulties to obtain, and &s;eeks for with great cunning and avidity.</P>
<P>This animal enjoys, in a &s;uperior degree, the &s;en&s;es of hearing, &s;melling, and touching.&mdash;Its ears are &s;hort and rounded; and its eyes &s;mall, but lively and pene|trating, and defended by a nictating membrane: From
<PB N="247" REF="254">
the peculiar formation of the internal parts of its no&s;e, its &s;en&s;e of &s;melling is exceedingly exqui&s;ite: The legs and thighs are &s;trong and mu&s;cular; it has five toes on each foot, and u&s;es its fore foot as a hand, although the toes are not &s;eparated as in mo&s;t animals that do &s;o; the large&s;t finger is on the out&s;ide.</P>
<P>The voice of the Bear is a deep and &s;urly kind of growl, which it frequently exerts without the lea&s;t cau&s;e. It is very ea&s;ily irritated; and at that time its re&s;entment is furious, and often capriciou&s;ly exerted.&mdash;When tamed, it appears mild and obedient to its ma&s;ter; but it is not to be tru&s;ted without the utmo&s;t caution. It may be taught to walk upright, to dance, to lay hold of a pole with its paws, and perform various tricks to entertain the multitude, who are highly plea&s;ed to &s;ee the auk|ward mea&s;ures of this rugged creature, which it &s;eems to &s;uit to the &s;ound of an in&s;trument, or to the voice of its leader. But to give the Bear this kind of education, it mu&s;t be taken when young, and accu&s;tomed early to re&s;traint and di&s;cipline: An old Bear will &s;uffer neither, without di&s;covering the mo&s;t furious re&s;entment; neither the voice nor the menaces of his keeper have any effect upon him; he equally growls at the hand that is held out to feed, as at that which is rai&s;ed to correct him.</P>
<P>The exce&s;&s;ive cruelties practi&s;ed upon this poor animal in teaching it to walk erect, and regulate its motions to the &s;ound of the flagelet, are &s;uch as make &s;en&s;ibility &s;hudder. Its eyes are put out; and an iron ring being put through the cartilage of the no&s;e to lead it by, it is kept from food, and beaten, till it yield obedience to the will of its &s;avage tutors. Some of them are taught to perform by &s;etting their feet upon hot iron plates, and
<PB N="248" REF="255">
then playing to them whil&s;t in this unea&s;y &s;ituation.&mdash; It is truly &s;hocking to every feeling mind to reflect, that &s;uch cruelties &s;hould be exerci&s;ed upon any part of the brute creation by our fellow men. That they &s;hould be rewarded by numbers of unthinking people, who crowd around them to &s;ee the poor animal's rude attempts to imitate human actions, is not to be wondered at; but it is much to be wi&s;hed, that the timely interference of the magi&s;trate would prevent every exhibition of this kind, that, in England at lea&s;t, we might not be reproached with tolerating practices &s;o di&s;graceful to humanity.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e animals, pre&s;ented to the prince of Wales a few years ago, was kept in the Tower. By the care|le&s;&s;ne&s;s of the &s;ervant, the door of his den was left open; and the keeper's wife happening to go acro&s;s the court at the &s;ame time, the animal flew out, &s;eized the wo|man, threw her down, and fa&s;tened upon her neck, which he bit; and, without offering any further vio|lence, lay upon her, &s;ucking the blood out of the wound. Re&s;i&s;tance was in vain, as it only &s;erved to irritate the creature; and &s;he mu&s;t inevitably have peri&s;hed, had not her hu&s;band luckily di&s;covered her &s;ituation. By a &s;ud|den blow, he obliged the Bear to quit his hold, and re|tire to his den, which he did with great reluctance, and not without making a &s;econd attempt to come at the wo|man, who was almo&s;t dead through fear and lo&s;s of blood. It is &s;omewhat remarkable, that whenever it happened to &s;ee her afterwards, it growled, and made mo&s;t violent &s;truggles to get out to her.&mdash;The prince, upon hearing of the circum&s;tance, ordered the Bear to be killed.</P>
<P>The Bears of America are &s;mall and black, live entire|ly upon vegetable food, and are particularly fond of
<PB N="249" REF="256">
maize, potatoes, honey, and milk. Though pre&s;&s;ed with extreme hunger, they will not eat animal food.&mdash;They lodge in the hollow trunks of large trees, which they a&s;cend and de&s;cend with great ea&s;e and agility.&mdash;The hunters take them by &s;etting fire to their habitations. The old one comes out fir&s;t, and is generally &s;lain before &s;he reaches the ground; the cubs follow her, and are taken alive.&mdash;The fle&s;h of the young Bear is reckoned a great delicacy; and the paws of the old one are e&s;teemed as a mo&s;t exqui&s;ite mor&s;el. The fat is white, and very &s;weet; and the oil is &s;aid to be of great u&s;e in &s;oftening &s;wellings proceeding from &s;prains.&mdash;Great numbers are killed annually in America for the &s;ake of their &s;kins, which form a con&s;iderable article of commerce.</P>
<P>Bears were formerly common in Greece. The Ro|mans brought them from Lybia to be exhibited in their public &s;pectacles. They are likewi&s;e found in China, Japan, and as far as the i&s;land of Java.</P>
<P>The mountains of Great Tartary produce great num|bers of Bears perfectly white, which do not differ in form from tho&s;e ju&s;t mentioned. Some, from the confines of Ru&s;&s;ia, are of a mixed colour, with black and white hairs.</P>
<P>The Bear was once an inhabitant of this i&s;land, and was included in the ancient laws and regulations re&s;pect|ing bea&s;ts of cha&s;e. Long after their extirpation, they were imported for the cruel purpo&s;e of baiting them, which at that time was a favourite amu&s;ement of our an|ce&s;tors.

<P>"The natives generally contrive to reach the ground, frequented by the Bears, about &s;un-&s;et. Their fir&s;t bu|&s;ine&s;s, when they arrive there, is to look out for their tracks, and to attend particularly to the fre&s;he&s;t of them, always paying a regard to the &s;ituation with re&s;pect to concealment, and taking aim at the animal as it pa&s;&s;es by, or as it advances or goes from them. The&s;e tracks are numerous between the woods and the lakes, and are often found among the long &s;edgy gra&s;s and brakes on the margin of the water. Having determined upon a convenient &s;pot for concealment, the hunters fix their crutches in the ground, on which they re&s;t their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ire|locks, pointing them in a proper direction. They after|wards kneel or lie down, as the circum&s;tances of their &s;ituation may require; and, having their bear-&s;pears in readine&s;s by their &s;ide, wait the arrival of their game. &mdash;The&s;e precautions are extremely nece&s;&s;ary on many accounts, that the hunters may make &s;ure of their mark:

For the price of ammunition is &s;o high at Kamt&s;chatka, that the value of a Bear will not purcha&s;e more of it than will load a mu&s;quet four or five times. It is much more material on another con&s;ideration; for, if the fir&s;t &s;hot &s;hould not render the animal incapable of pur&s;uit, fatal con&s;equences too frequently en&s;ue. The enraged bea&s;t makes immediately towards the place from whence the &s;ound and &s;moke i&s;&s;ue, and furiou&s;ly attacks his adver|&s;aries. They have not &s;ufficient time to re-load their pieces, as the Bear is &s;eldom fired at till he comes within the di&s;tance of fifteen yards; therefore, if he &s;hould not happen to fall, they immediately prepare to receive him upon their &s;pears; their &s;afety depending, in a great mea&s;ure, on their giving him a mortal &s;tab as he ad|vances towards them. Should he parry the thru&s;t, (which the&s;e animals are &s;ometimes enabled to do, by the &s;trength and agility of their paws) and break in upon his opponents, the conflict becomes dreadful, and it is &s;eldom that the lo&s;s of a &s;ingle life will &s;atisfy the bea&s;t's revenge.</P>
<P>"The bu&s;ine&s;s or diver&s;ion of Bear-hunting is parti|cularly dangerous at two &s;ea&s;ons of the year: In the &s;pring, when they fir&s;t i&s;&s;ue from their caves, after hav|ing &s;ub&s;i&s;ted the whole winter (as it is here po&s;itively a&s;|&s;erted) &s;olely on &s;ucking their paws; and e&s;pecially if the fro&s;t &s;hould continue to be &s;evere, and the ice in the lakes is not broken up; as they cannot then have recour&s;e to their cu&s;tomary and expected food. Thus becoming exceedingly fami&s;hed, they grow fierce and &s;avage in proportion; pur&s;uing the inhabitants by the &s;cent; and, pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ng about at a di&s;tance from their u&s;ual tracks, dart upon them unawar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, as
<PB N="253" REF="260">
the natives have no idea of &s;hooting flying, or even run|ning, or in any manner without re&s;ting their piece, they often fall a &s;acrifice to their rapacity.&mdash;The time of their copulation, which is in autumn, is the other dangerous &s;ea&s;on to meet with them.</P>
<P>"Many extraordinary and affecting in&s;tances of natu|ral affection in the&s;e animals are related by the Kamt|&s;chadales; who, from this circum&s;tance, derive con&s;ider|able advantage in hunting. They never pre&s;ume to fire at a young Bear, if the dam is upon the &s;pot; for, if the cub &s;hould happen to be killed, &s;he becomes enraged to an immoderate degree; and, if &s;he can only obtain a &s;ight of the offender, &s;he is &s;ure to be revenged of him, or die in the attempt. On the other hand, if the mother &s;hould be &s;hot, the cubs continue by her &s;ide after &s;he has been a long time dead; exhibiting, by the mo&s;t af|fecting ge&s;tures and motions, the mo&s;t poignant afflic|tion. The hunters, in&s;tead of commi&s;erating their di&s;|tre&s;&s;es, embrace the&s;e opportunities of de&s;troying them.</P>
<P>"If the veracity of the Kamt&s;chadales is to be de|pended on, the &s;agacity of the Bears is as extraordinary as their natural affection.&mdash;Innumerable are the &s;tories which they relate to this effect. One remarkable in|&s;tance, however, we cannot avoid mentioning, as it is admitted among the natives as a well-atte&s;ted fact. It is the &s;tratagem they put in practice to catch the bareins, which run too &s;wift for them to expect &s;ucce&s;s in pur&s;u|ing them. The&s;e animals herd together in great num|bers; and their u&s;ual haunts are low grounds, at the foot of rocks and precipices, where they delight in brow&s;ing. The Bear pur&s;ues them by the &s;cent, till he obtains a view of them; and then advances warily, keeping in a
<PB N="254" REF="261">
&s;ituation above them; at the &s;ame time concealing him|&s;elf among the rocks as the approaches, till he is almo&s;t immediately over them, and near enough to carry his purpo&s;e into execution: Then, with his paws, he pu&s;hes down large pieces of the rock among&s;t the herd below. If he perceives that he has &s;ucceeded in maiming any of the flock, he immediately pur&s;ues them; and according to the injury the poor bareins have received, he either proves &s;ucce&s;sful in overtaking them, or they e&s;cape by the rapidity of their flight.</P>
<P>"The Kamt&s;chadales acknowledge infinite obligations to the Bears for all the little progre&s;s they have hitherto made, as well in the &s;ciences as the polite arts. They confe&s;s them&s;elves indebted wholly to tho&s;e animals for all their knowledge in phy&s;ic and &s;urgery; that, by ob|&s;erving what herbs they have applied to the wounds they have received, and what methods they have pur&s;ued when they were languid and out of order, they have ac|quired a knowledge of mo&s;t of tho&s;e &s;imples which they have now recour&s;e to, either as external or internal ap|plications. But the mo&s;t &s;ingular circum&s;tance of all is, that they admit the Bears to be their dancing-ma&s;ters; though the evidence of our own &s;en&s;es places this mat|ter beyond all di&s;pute; for, in the bear-dance of the Kamt&s;chadales, every ge&s;ture and attitude peculiar to that animal was faithfully exhibited. All their other dances are &s;imilar to this in many particulars; and tho&s;e attitudes are thought to come the neare&s;t to perfection which mo&s;t re&s;emble the motions of the Bear."</P>
<P>During &s;ummer, the&s;e animals take up their re&s;idence on large i&s;lands of ice, and frequently pa&s;s from one to another. They &s;wim well, and can go to the di&s;tance of
<PB N="255" REF="262">
&s;ix or &s;even leagues: They likewi&s;e dive, but do not con|tinue long under water.&mdash;When the pieces of ice are de|tached by &s;trong winds or currents, the Bears allow them&s;elves to be carried along with them; and as they cannot regain the land, or abandon the ice on which they are embarked, they often peri&s;h in the open &s;ea. Tho&s;e which arrive with the ice on the coa&s;ts of Iceland or Norway, are almo&s;t fami&s;hed with hunger from the length of their voyage, and are extremely voracious.&mdash; As &s;oon as the natives di&s;cover one of them, they arm them&s;elves, and pre&s;ently di&s;patch him.</P>
<P>The ferocity of the Bear is as remarkable as its at|tachment to its young. A few years &s;ince, the crew of a boat belonging to a &s;hip in the whale-fi&s;hery &s;hot at a Bear at a &s;hort di&s;tance, and wounded it: The animal immediately &s;et up the mo&s;t dreadful yells, and ran along the ice towards the boat. Before it reached it, a &s;econd &s;hot was fired at and hit it. This &s;erved to increa&s;e its fury. It pre&s;ently &s;wam to the boat; and in attempting to get on board, reached its fore foot upon the gunnel; but one of the crew having a hatchet, cut it off. The animal &s;till, however, continued to &s;wim after them till they arrived at the &s;hip; and &s;everal &s;hots were fired at it, which al&s;o took effect: But on reaching the &s;hip, it immediately a&s;cended the deck; and the crew having fled into the &s;hrowds, it was pur&s;uing them thither, when a &s;hot from one of them laid it dead upon the deck.</P>
<P>The fle&s;h of the&s;e animals is white, and &s;aid to ta&s;te like mutton. The fat is melted for train-oil; and that of the feet is u&s;ed in medicine.</P>
<P>The White Bear brings forth two young at a time. Their fondne&s;s for their offspring is &s;o great, that they
<PB N="256" REF="263">
will die rather than de&s;ert them. Wounds &s;erve only to make the attachment more violent. They embrace their cubs to the la&s;t, and bemoan them with the mo&s;t piteous cries.</P>
<P>The&s;e creatures feed on fi&s;h, &s;eals, and the carca&s;es of whales; are fond of human blood; and are &s;o fearle&s;s, as to attack companies of armed men, and even to board &s;mall ve&s;&s;els. Allured by the &s;cent of &s;eals fle&s;h, they often break into the huts of the Greenlanders. They &s;ometimes attack the Mor&s;e; with which they have ter|rible conflicts: But the large teeth of that animal give it a decided &s;uperiority over the Bear, which is generally wor&s;ted.</P>

</FIGURE> THE STRIPED HYENA.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH naturali&s;ts, both ancient and mo|dern, have de&s;cribed the Hyena under different denominations, and have a&s;cribed to it properties which it is now known not to po&s;&s;e&s;s; yet its characters are &s;o &s;ingular, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to mi&s;take them, and &s;o pe|culiar, as to di&s;tingui&s;h it from every other cla&s;s of ani|mals. In many re&s;pects it re&s;embles tho&s;e of the Dog kind, has &s;ome &s;imilitude to the Wolf in form and di&s;po|&s;ition, and is about the &s;ame &s;ize.</P>
<P>The Hyena has only four toes on each foot, in which it differs from almo&s;t every other quadruped; its head is broad and flat, and its muzzle &s;horter than that of the Wolf; its fore legs are longer than the hind ones; its ears are long, pointed, and bare; and its eyes are re|markably wild, &s;ullen, and ferocious.</P>
<P>There are two varieties of this animal,&mdash;the one &s;tri|ped, and the other &s;potted. The hair of the former is of
<PB N="258" REF="265">
an a&s;h colour, marked with long black &s;tripes, di&s;po&s;ed in waves, from the back downward; there are others acro&s;s the legs; the hair, in general, is coar&s;e and rough; its tail is &s;hort and bu&s;hy, with pretty long hair, &s;ome|times plain, and &s;ometimes barred with black; immedi|ately underneath the tail, and above the anus, there is an orifice like that of the Badger, which opens into a kind of pouch, and contains a &s;ub&s;tance of the con&s;i&s;t|ence of civet, but of a rank, di&s;agreeable odour. This opening may probably have given ri&s;e to the error of the ancients, who a&s;&s;erted, that the Hyena was every alter|nate year male and female. Its manner of holding its head is &s;omewhat like a Dog pur&s;uing a &s;cent, with its no&s;e near the ground. This po&s;ition of the head makes the &s;houlders appear more elevated. A bri&s;tly mane runs along the top of the back from head to tail, which gives it an appearance &s;omething like a Hog; from whence, probably, it may have derived its name, the word <HI>huaina</HI> being a Greek word derived from <HI>hus,</HI> which &s;ignifies a Sow.&mdash;Such are the mo&s;t &s;triking di&s;|tinctions of the Hyena, which has been pictured by ig|norance and timidity under every form that can &s;trike terror into the imagination. Wonderful powers were a&s;cribed to it by the ancients; who believed that it changed its &s;ex; that it imitated the human voice, and by that means attracted unwary travellers, and de&s;troyed them; that it had the power of charming the &s;hepherds, and as it were rivetting them to the place where they &s;tood. Many other things, equally ab&s;urd, have been told of this animal; but the&s;e are &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that objects of terror and &s;uper&s;tition are nearly allied; and when once they have taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the human mind,
<PB N="259" REF="266">
the mo&s;t improbable &s;tories are ea&s;ily received and cre|dited.</P>
<P>This &s;avage and &s;olitary animal re&s;ides in the caverns of mountains, in the clefts of rocks, or in holes and dens, which it digs in the earth.&mdash;Its di&s;po&s;ition is ex|tremely ferocious; and, though taken young, it never can be tamed.&mdash;It lives by depredations, like the Wolf; but is &s;tronger, and more daring and rapacious. It will &s;ometimes attack men, and ru&s;hes with fury upon all kinds of cattle: It follows the flocks, ravages the &s;heep|fold, and de&s;troys every thing within its reach with the mo&s;t in&s;atiable voracity.&mdash;Its eyes &s;hine in the dark; and it is a&s;&s;erted, with &s;ome appearance of probability, that it can &s;ee nearly as well by night as by day.&mdash;When de|&s;titute of other provi&s;ions, it ran&s;acks the graves, and de|vours putrid human bodies that have been long buried.</P>
<P>The voice of the Hyena is very peculiar: Its begin|ning &s;eems to be &s;omewhat like the moaning of a human voice, and the ending like one making a violent effort to vomit.</P>
<P>This animal inhabits A&s;iatic Turkey, Syria, Per&s;ia, and Barbary.&mdash;The &s;uper&s;titious Arabs, when they kill one of them, carefully bury the head, le&s;t it &s;hould be applied to magical purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>The courage of the Hyena is equal to its rapacity: It will defend it&s;elf with great ob&s;tinacy again&s;t much larger quadrupeds: It is not afraid of the Lion nor the Panther, will &s;ometimes attack the Ounce, and &s;eldom fails to con|quer.</P>

<P>is called at the Cape of Good Hope the <HI>Tiger-Wolf,</HI> and is very common in that part of the world.&mdash;Sparrman de&s;cribes it as a cruel, mi&s;chievous, and formidable ani|mal. Its horrid yells are to be heard every night, whil&s;t it prowls about for its prey, and lurks near the farm|yards, where cattle are kept: The&s;e are well defended by Dogs, of which the Hyena, though larger and &s;tronger, is much afraid; and will not venture an attack, unle&s;s pre&s;&s;ed by the mo&s;t urgent nece&s;&s;ity: Neither will it dare to &s;eize upon any of the larger animals; &s;uch as Oxen, Cows, Hor&s;es&punc; &amp;c. whil&s;t they make the lea&s;t appear|ance of defending them&s;elves, or even if they do not be|tray any &s;ymptoms of fear. It &s;ometimes endeavours to di&s;per&s;e the cattle by its hideous roaring; after which it &s;elects and pur&s;ues one of them, which it &s;oon di&s;ables by a deadly bite, and then devours.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals were formerly &s;o bold, as to mole&s;t the Hottentots in their huts, and &s;ometimes carry off their
<PB N="261" REF="268">
children; but, &s;ince the introduction of fire-arms, tho&s;e and other wild bea&s;ts keep at a greater di&s;tance from the habitations of mankind. It is a fact, however, that num|bers of the&s;e Wolves are known to attend almo&s;t every dark night about the &s;hambles at the Cape; where they meet with bones, &s;kin, and other offals, which are left there by the inhabitants, who &s;uffer the animals to come unmole&s;ted, and carry off their refu&s;e; and it is &s;ome|what remarkable, that they have &s;eldom been known to do any mi&s;chief there, though fed in the very heart of the town.</P>
<P>The howlings of the Hyena are dreadful beyond all conception, and &s;pread a general alarm. They are al|mo&s;t ince&s;&s;ant, and &s;eem to be the natural con&s;equence of its craving appetite. Perhaps it may not be going too far to &s;ay, that Nature has kindly impre&s;&s;ed this involun|tary di&s;po&s;ition to yelling upon this animal, that every living creature might be upon its guard, and &s;ecure it|&s;elf from the attacks of &s;o cruel an enemy.</P>
<P>The general colour of this animal is a reddi&s;h-brown, marked with di&s;tinct round black &s;pots, the hind legs with tran&s;ver&s;e black bars; its head is large and flat; above each eye, as well as on the lips, it has long whi&s;|kers; a &s;hort black mane runs along the top of the back; its ears are &s;hort and a little pointed; its face and the upper part of its head are black.</P>

<P>WE beg leave to make our acknowledgments to Mr Pennant for the drawing of this animal, which he was &s;o obliging as to favour us with. He a&s;|&s;ures us it was drawn from the living animal; and we doubt not, therefore, its being a faithful repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>The &s;pecies of the Jackal is diffu&s;ed, with &s;ome varie|ty, through almo&s;t every part of A&s;ia; and is found in Barbary, and other parts of Africa as far as the Cape of Good Hope. Although it is one of the mo&s;t numerous of all the wild animals of the Ea&s;t, there is &s;carcely any le&s;s known in Europe, or more confu&s;edly de&s;cribed by natural hi&s;torians.</P>
<P>The&s;e creatures differ in &s;ize; tho&s;e of the warme&s;t climates are &s;aid to be the large&s;t: They are of a reddi&s;h-brown colour. The &s;maller Jackal is about the &s;ize of a Fox; and its colour is a bright-yellow.&mdash;In general, this animal may be &s;aid to partake of a middle nature, be|tween the Wolf and the Dog; and to the &s;avage fierce|ne&s;s of the one, it adds the impudent familiarity of the
<PB N="263" REF="270">
other.&mdash;Its cry is a di&s;mal howl, mixed with barking. It is more noi&s;y in its pur&s;uits than the Dog, and more voracious than the Wolf.</P>
<P>Jackals go in packs of forty or fifty, and hunt like hounds in full cry from evening till morning. They de|&s;troy the poultry, and attack the flocks: They roam through the villages and gardens, and carry off every thing they can eat: They enter &s;tables, yards, and out|hou&s;es; and devour &s;kins, and every thing that is made of leather; &s;uch as harne&s;&s;ing, boots, &s;hoes, &amp;c. No|thing can e&s;cape their rapacity: They will ran&s;ack the repo&s;itories of the dead, and greedily devour the mo&s;t putrid bodies; for which rea&s;on, in tho&s;e countries where they abound, the inhabitants are obliged to make the graves of a great depth, and &s;ecure them with &s;pines to prevent the Jackals from raking up the earth with their feet. They are &s;aid to attend caravans, and follow armies, in hopes of being furni&s;hed with a banquet by di&s;ea&s;e or battle.&mdash;They may be con&s;idered as the vulture among quadrupeds; and, like that de&s;tructive bird, de|vour every thing indi&s;criminately that has once had ani|mal life.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals hide them&s;elves in holes and dens by day, and &s;eldom appear abroad till the evening; when they fill the air with the mo&s;t horrid howlings, and be|gin the cha&s;e. The Lion, the Panther, and other bea&s;ts of prey that do not follow by the &s;cent, take advantage of the general con&s;ternation, and follow in &s;ilence be|hind till the Jackals have hunted down their prey: They then devour the fruits of their labours, and leave them only the remains of the &s;poil; from whence the Jackal has been vulgarly called the <HI>Lion's Provider,</HI> as if tho&s;e
<PB N="264" REF="271">
two animals acted in concert, and had formed a plan for their mutual &s;upport.</P>
<P>The Jackal frequently pur&s;ues the Gazelle; and is &s;o bold, as to follow it even into the mid&s;t of a town or village, whither that timid animal frequently flies for protection, and by that means &s;ometimes e&s;capes: For the ince&s;&s;ant barking of the Jackal alarms the inhabi|tants; who &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly out, and drive off the pur&s;uer, in hopes of being able to &s;ecure the game.</P>
<P>Sparrman's de&s;cription of tho&s;e he &s;aw at the Cape differs materially from the accounts we have been able to collect from other authors. He &s;ays they are about three feet in length, and their tails little more than a foot long: The predominant colour is a reddi&s;h-yellow; the legs are of a pale-gold colour; under the belly, and on the in&s;ide of the legs, the colour inclines to white; the no&s;e and ears are of a brighter red; the head, neck, and back, are grey; the tail is partly grey, and partly of an umber colour, and black at the tip. He &s;ays it re|&s;embles the European Fox in form, manners, and di&s;po&s;i|tion; and is not known to a&s;&s;emble in packs for the pur|po&s;e of hunting; neither is its voracity equal to that a&s;cribed to it by other narurali&s;ts.&mdash;It is probable it may have been confounded with the Wild Dog, which is common at the Cape, and hunts its prey in packs. It i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> very fierce and mi&s;chievous, and very de&s;tructive to the fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cks of Sheep and Goats in tho&s;e parts.

<HEAD>THE FOX.</HEAD>
<P>THIS lively and crafty animal is common to every part of Great-Britain; and is &s;o well known, as not to require a particular de&s;cription.</P>
<P>M. Buffon has taken great pains to prove, that the Dog and the Fox will not breed together. For this purpo&s;e, he kept two males and a female for a con&s;iderable time, and tried to make the males copulate with bitches, which they uniformly refu&s;ed; and from thence he concludes, that no mixture can take place between the two &s;pecies. But it &s;hould be remembered, that the Foxes were in a &s;tate of confinement; and of cour&s;e, many circum&s;tances might concur to di&s;gu&s;t them, and render the experiment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. In confirmation of this, we need only ob&s;erve, that the &s;ame Foxes, which, when at liberty, darted on the poultry with their u&s;ual eagerne&s;s, never attempted to touch a &s;ingle fowl after they were chained: And we are told further, "that a living hen was generally fixed near them for a whole night; and, though food was kept from them for many hours, yet, in &s;pite of hunger and opportunity, they never forgot that they were chained, and di&s;turbed not the hen." Now if any one &s;hould be &s;o h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rdy as to a&s;&s;ert from this, that Foxes have a natural <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to poultry, one may ea&s;ily conceive how little credit would be given to the conclu&s;ion, and how much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ughter it would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.

&s;malle&s;t doubt. It is a common practice in many places to tie up a bitch that is in &s;ea&s;on, where &s;he may be vi|&s;ited by a Fox, and be impregnated by him: The fruits of the connection are &s;ufficiently obvious; mo&s;t, if not all the puppies have a &s;trong re&s;emblance to the Fox: The &s;harp no&s;e, prick ears, long body, and &s;hort legs of the Fox, evidently point out their origin.&mdash;The&s;e Dogs are highly e&s;teemed by farmers and graziers as the mo&s;t u&s;eful kind for driving cattle. They bite keenly; are extremely active and playful; and are very expert at de|&s;troying wea&s;els, rats, and other vermin.</P>
<P>The Fox &s;leeps much during the day; but the night is its &s;ea&s;on of activity, and the time when it roams about in &s;earch of prey.&mdash;It will eat fle&s;h of any kind; but pre|fers that of hares, rabbits, poultry, and all kinds of birds.

<P>In France and Italy, the Fox does great damage a|mong the vineyards by feeding on the grapes, of which it is extremely fond.&mdash;It boldly attacks the wild bees, and frequently robs them of their &s;tores; but not with impunity: The whole &s;warm flies out, and fa&s;tens upon the invader; but he retires only for a few minutes, and rids him&s;elf of the bees by rolling upon the ground; by which means he cru&s;hes &s;uch as &s;tick to him, and then returns to his charge, and devours both wax and honey.</P>
<P>The cunning of the Fox in &s;urprizing and &s;ecuring its prey is equally remarkable: When it has acquired more than it can devour, its fir&s;t care is to &s;ecure what it has killed, which is generally all within its reach. It digs
<PB N="268" REF="275">
holes in different places, where it conceals its booty by carefully covering it with earth to prevent a di&s;covery. If a flock of poultry have unfortunately fallen victims to its &s;tratagems, it will bring them, one by one, to the&s;e hiding-places; where it leaves them till hunger demands fre&s;h &s;upplies.</P>
<P>The cha&s;e of the Fox is a very favourite diver&s;ion in this kingdom, and is no-where pur&s;ued with &s;uch ardour and intrepidity. Both our Dogs and Hor&s;es are con|fe&s;&s;edly &s;uperior to tho&s;e of any other country.&mdash;The in|&s;tant the Fox finds he is pur&s;ued, he flies towards his hole; and finding it &s;topped, which is always carefully done before the cha&s;e begins, he has recour&s;e to his &s;peed and his cunning for &s;afety. He does not double and mea&s;ure his ground back like the Hare; but conti|nues his cour&s;e &s;traight forward before the Hounds with great &s;trength and per&s;everance. Both Dogs and Hor&s;es, particularly the latter, have frequently fallen victims to the ardour of the pur&s;uit; which has &s;ometimes conti|nued for upwards of fifty miles without the &s;malle&s;t in|termi&s;&s;ion, and almo&s;t at full &s;peed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr CHARLES TURNER'S Hounds hunted at Ayreyholm, near Hurworth, in the county of Durham, and found the noted old Fox CESAR, which made an extraordinary cha&s;e: After a round of four miles, he led to Smeaton, through Hornby and Appleton; then back again to Hornby, Wor&s;et-moor, Pier&s;burgh, Limpton, Craythorn, Middleton, Hilton&punc; Seamer, Newby, Marton, Orm&s;|by; then upon Hambleton, through Kirkleatham-park, Uplea|tham, Sk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lton, and K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ton.

hard to &s;ay, whether the &s;pirited eagerne&s;s of the Hounds, the ardour of the Hor&s;es, or the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the hun|ters, is mo&s;t to be admired. The Fox is the only one of the party which has the plea of nece&s;&s;ity on his &s;ide; and it operates &s;o &s;trongly, that he often e&s;capes the utmo&s;t efforts of his pur&s;uers, and returns to his hole in &s;afety. The &s;mell of his urine is &s;o offen&s;ive to the Dogs, that it &s;ometimes proves the means of his e&s;cape from them. When all his &s;hifts have failed him, and he is at la&s;t over|taken, he then defends him&s;elf with great ob&s;tinacy, and fights in &s;ilence till he is torn in pieces by the Dogs.</P>

<P>The eye of the Fox is of a lively hazel colour, very &s;ignificant and expre&s;&s;ive; and di&s;covers very &s;en&s;ibly the differ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt emotions of love, fear, or anger, by which it may be affected.&mdash;It &s;eems greatly to admire its bu&s;hy tail, and frequently amu&s;es it&s;elf by endeavouring to catch it as it runs round.

<P><PB N="271" REF="278">The Fox &s;leeps &s;ound; and, like the Dog, lies in a round form. When he is only repo&s;ing him&s;elf, he &s;tretches out his hind legs, and lies on his belly. In this po&s;ition, he &s;pies the birds as they alight on the hedges or places near him, and is ready to &s;pring upon &s;uch as are within his reach. He rarely lies expo&s;ed; but chu&s;es the cover of &s;ome thick brake, where he is pretty &s;ecure from being &s;urprized.&mdash;Crows, magpies, and other birds which con&s;ider the Fox as a common enemy, will often give notice of his retreat by the mo&s;t clamourous notes; and frequently follow him a con&s;iderable way from tree to tree, repeating their outcries.</P>
<P>Foxes produce but once a year, from three to &s;ix young ones at a time. When the female is pregnant, &s;he re|tires, and &s;eldom goes out of her hole, where &s;he pre|pares a bed for her young. She comes in &s;ea&s;on in the winter; and young Foxes are found in the month of April. If &s;he perceive that her habitation is di&s;covered, &s;he carries them off, one by one, to a more &s;ecure retreat. &mdash;The young are brought forth blind, like puppies. They grow eighteen months or two years, and live thir|teen or fourteen years.</P>
<P>The Fox is frequently taken in traps; but great cau|tion mu&s;t be u&s;ed to deceive this wily animal. The trap mu&s;t be placed in the mid&s;t of a field, where there is nei|ther hedge nor path near it; and &s;o nicely covered with mould, that not the lea&s;t ve&s;tige can be &s;een where it lies: About the trap, and at a &s;mall di&s;tance from it, in different places, a few pieces of chee&s;e, or other &s;trong|ly-&s;cented food, mu&s;t be carele&s;sly &s;cattered: Then with a Sheep's paunch, or &s;ome other animal &s;ub&s;tance, a trail is made, of about a mile in length, to the diffe|rent

places where the bait is laid, and from thence to the trap: The &s;hoes of the per&s;on who carries the trail mu&s;t be likewi&s;e well rubbed with the paunch, that the Fox may not di&s;cover his &s;cent. He then approaches with more confidence; and if the de&s;ign be well conducted, &s;eldom fails of being caught.</P>
<P>There are great varieties of this animal apparently pro|duced by the influence of climate. Tho&s;e of this coun|try are mo&s;tly of a tawny-red, mixed with a&s;h colour; the fore part of the legs is black; and the tail tipt with white.&mdash;In colder countries, Foxes are of various colours.</P>

<P>is mo&s;t valuable for its fur, which is e&s;teemed in Ru&s;&s;ia &s;uperior to that of the fine&s;t Sable: A &s;ingle &s;kin will &s;ell for four hundred rubles.</P>

</FIGURE> THE ARCTIC FOX</HEAD>
<P>inhabits the countries bordering on the Frozen Sea. It is found in Greenland, Iceland, Spitzbergen, Nova-Zem|bla, and Lapland; in Kamt&s;chatka, and the oppo&s;ite parts of America.&mdash;It burrows in the ground, and makes holes &s;everal feet in length, at the end of which it forms a ne&s;t with mo&s;s. In Greenland and Spitzbergen, it lives in the clefts of rocks, being unable to burrow on account of the fro&s;t. Two or three of them inhabit the &s;ame hole.</P>
<P>This animal is endowed with all the cunning of the common Fox; preys on young gee&s;e, ducks, and other water-fowl, before they are able to fly; likewi&s;e, on
<PB N="274" REF="281">
hares, wild birds, and eggs: And in Greenland, for want of other food, it feeds on berries and &s;hell-fi&s;h. In Lap|land and the North of A&s;ia, their principal food is the Leming, or Lapland Marmot; immen&s;e &s;hoals of which &s;ometimes cover the face of the country. The Foxes fol|low them, in their migrations, from one place to ano|ther; and as the return of the Marmot is very uncertain, and frequently after great intervals of time, they are &s;ometimes ab&s;ent three or four years in pur&s;uit of this their favourite prey.</P>
<P>The hair of the Arctic Fox is of an a&s;h colour, but changes to white in the winter, when it is long, &s;oft, and &s;omewhat woolly: Its tail is &s;horter than that of the common Fox, and more bu&s;hy; and its toes are covered with fur on the under part, like tho&s;e of a Hare: It is &s;maller and more &s;lender than the European Fox: Its no&s;e is &s;harp and black; and its ears &s;hort, and almo&s;t hid in the fur.&mdash;It is &s;ometimes taken in traps; but its &s;kin being of little value, it is not hunted with much eagerne&s;s.</P>

</FIGURE> THE WOLF.</HEAD>
<P>ALL naturali&s;ts agree in placing the Wolf and the Dog in the &s;ame cla&s;s; and, from the &s;lighte&s;t in|&s;pection of their outward form only, one would be led to conclude the Wolf was in every re&s;pect a Dog in its &s;tate of natural freedom. The chief difference con&s;i&s;ts in the form of its head; its eyes are fixed in a more ob|lique po&s;ition, and being of a bright-green colour, give it a look of the mo&s;t &s;avage fiercene&s;s; its ears are &s;harp and erect; its tail long, bu&s;hy, and bending inwards be|tween its hind legs; its body is &s;tronger than that of al|mo&s;t any &s;pecies of Dogs, its jaws and teeth larger, and its hair coar&s;er and thicker. The internal &s;tructure of the&s;e animals is, however, very &s;imilar. The Wolf cou|ples in the &s;ame manner as the Dog; and its immediate &s;eparation is prevented from the &s;ame cau&s;e. The time of ge&s;tation is al&s;o nearly the &s;ame; and, from a variety of &s;ucce&s;sful experiments related by the celebrated Dr Hunter, there is no longer any room to doubt, that the
<PB N="276" REF="283">
Wolf and the Dog will copulate together, and produce an intermediate &s;pecies, capable of &s;ub&s;equent propaga|tion.</P>
<P>The appetite of the Wolf, for every kind of animal food, is exce&s;&s;ively voracious; and, although Nature has furni&s;hed it with every requi&s;ite for pur&s;uing and con|quering its prey, it is frequently reduced to the la&s;t ex|tremity, and &s;ometimes peri&s;hes for want of food: So great is the general dete&s;tation of this de&s;tructive crea|ture, that all the wild animals endeavour to avoid it, and mo&s;t commonly e&s;cape by their &s;uperior &s;wiftne&s;s.&mdash; When pre&s;&s;ed with hunger from repeated di&s;appoint|ments, the Wolf becomes ingenious from want, and courageous from nece&s;&s;ity. It then braves every danger, and even attacks tho&s;e animals that are under the pro|tection of man. Sometimes whole droves of them join in the cruel work of general deva&s;tation, roam through the villages, and attack the &s;heepfolds: They dig the earth under the doors, enter with dreadful ferocity, and put every living creature to death before they depart. The Hor&s;e is the only tame animal that can defend it&s;elf again&s;t them: All the weaker animals become their prey; even man him&s;elf, upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, frequently falls a victim to their rapacity; and it is &s;aid, that when once they have ta&s;ted human blood, they always give it the preference.&mdash;From hence, many &s;uper&s;titious &s;tories have been told of the Wolf: The old Saxons believed that it was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by &s;ome evil &s;pirit, and called it the <HI>Were-Wolf;</HI> and the French pea&s;ants, from the &s;ame rea&s;on, call it the <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">up-gar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u.</HI></P>
<P>The language of the poet is beautifully de&s;criptive of this creature's in&s;atiable fury:&mdash;

<L>Of horrid mountains, which the &s;hining Alps,</L>

<P>The Wolf has great &s;trength, e&s;pecially in the mu&s;cles of his neck and jaws. He can carry a Sheep in his mouth, and ea&s;ily run off with it in that manner. His bite is cruel and deadly, and keener as it meets with le&s;s re&s;i&s;tance; but when oppo&s;ed, he is cautious and circum&s;pect, and &s;eldom fights but from nece&s;&s;ity. He is harder and more robu&s;t, but not &s;o &s;en&s;ible as the Dog. He almo&s;t ince&s;&s;antly prowls about for prey, and of all animals is the mo&s;t difficult to conquer in the cha&s;e. His &s;en&s;e of &s;melling is peculiarly &s;trong: He &s;cents the track of animals, and follows it with great per&s;everance: The odour of carrion &s;trikes him at the di&s;tance of near a league.&mdash;Wolves are capable of bearing want of food for a long time: To allay their hunger, they will &s;ometimes fill their &s;tomachs with mud. They have been known to follow armies, and a&s;&s;emble in troops upon the field of battle; tear up &s;uch bodies as have been carele&s;sly interred, and devour them with in&s;atiable avidity.</P>
<P>In all ages, the Wolf has been con&s;idered as the mo&s;t &s;avage enemy of mankind, and rewards given for its head. Various methods have been taken to rid the world of this rapacious invader: Pit-falls, traps, and poi&s;on, have all been employed again&s;t him; and, hap|pily

for the&s;e i&s;lands, the whole race has long been ex|tirpated here. King Edgar attempted to effect it in Eng|land by remitting the puni&s;hment of certain crimes on producing a number of Wolves' tongues; and in Wales, the tax of gold and &s;ilver was commuted for an annual tribute of Wolves' heads.&mdash;Some centuries after that, the&s;e animals increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, as to become an object of royal attention; and great rewards were given for de&s;troying them. Camden informs us, that certain per&s;ons held their lands on condition of hunting and de&s;troying the Wolves that infe&s;ted the country; whence they were called the <HI>Wolve-hunt.</HI> In the reign of Athel&s;tan, Wolves abounded &s;o much in York&s;hire, that a retreat was built at Flixton to defend pa&s;&s;engers from their attacks.&mdash;As the ravages of the&s;e animals were greate&s;t during winter, particularly in January, when the cold was &s;evere&s;t, our Saxon ance&s;tors di&s;tingui&s;hed that month by the title of <HI>Wolf-moneth:</HI> They al&s;o called an outlaw <HI>Wolf&s;hed,</HI> as being out of the protection of the law, and as liable to be killed as that de&s;tructive bea&s;t.&mdash; They infe&s;ted Ireland many centuries after their extinc|tion in England; the la&s;t pre&s;entment for killing Wolves being made in the county of Cork about the year 1710.</P>

An opening is left at the top of the bank; and a Sheep that has been long dead, is the bait, to which he is allured by long trains, made from different places where he is known to haunt. As &s;oon as he arrives at the &s;pot, he examines every part of the inclo&s;ure; and, finding no other way to come at the booty, he precipitates him&s;elf to the bottom; and, having made a plentiful meal, en|deavours in vain to rea&s;cend. His di&s;appointment at not being able to get back is productive of the mo&s;t dreadful howlings, which alarm his enemies; and they either take him alive, or di&s;patch him with bludgeons.&mdash;It is re|markable, that when this animal finds there is no po&s;&s;i|bility of e&s;caping, his courage entirely for&s;akes him; and he is for &s;ome time &s;o &s;tupified with fear, that he may be killed without offering to re&s;i&s;t, or taken alive without much danger.&mdash;Wolves are &s;ometimes taken in &s;trong nets, into which they are driven by the hunters, who &s;urround a large tract of land, and with drums, horns, and other in&s;truments, accompanied with loud cries from a large company a&s;&s;embled upon the occa&s;ion, drive the animals towards the entrance of the nets; where they are entangled, and killed with clubs and hatchets.

<P>This u&s;eful animal, ever faithful to his charge, reigns at the head of the flock; where it is better heard, and more attended to, than even the voice of the &s;hepherd. Safety, order, and di&s;cipline, are the fruits of his vigi|lance and activity.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e large tracts of land which, in many parts of our i&s;land, are &s;olely appropriated to the feeding of Sheep and other cattle, this &s;agacious animal is of the utmo&s;t importance. Immen&s;e flocks may be &s;een conti|nually ranging over tho&s;e exten&s;ive wilds, as far as the eye can reach, &s;eemingly without controul: Their only guide is the &s;hepherd, attended by his faithful Dog, the con&s;tant companion of his toils: It receives his com|mands, and is always prompt to execute them; it is the watchful guardian of the flock, prevents them from &s;trag|gling, keeps them together, and conducts them from one part of their pa&s;ture to another; it will not &s;uffer any &s;trangers to mix with them, but carefully keeps off every intruder. In driving a number of Sheep to any di&s;tant part, a well-trained Dog never fails to confine them to
<PB N="285" REF="292">
the road, watches every avenue that leads from it; where he takes his &s;tand, threatening every delinquent: He pur&s;ues the &s;tragglers, if any &s;hould e&s;cape; and forces them into order, without doing them the lea&s;t injury. If the herd&s;man be obliged to leave them, he depends upon his Dog to keep the flock together; and as &s;oon as he hears the well-known &s;ignal, this faithful creature conducts them to his ma&s;ter, though at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance.</P>
<P>There is a very remarkable &s;ingularity in the feet of the Shepherd's Dog: All of them have one, and &s;ome two toes more than other Dogs, though they &s;eem not to be of much u&s;e. They appear to be de&s;titute of mu&s;|cles, and hang dangling at the hind part of the leg more like an unnatural excre&s;cence than a nece&s;&s;ary part of the animal. But the adage, that 'Nature has made nothing in vain,' ought to correct our deci&s;ion on their utility, which probably may exi&s;t unknown to us.</P>
<P>This breed of Dogs, at pre&s;ent, appears to be pre|&s;erved, in the greate&s;t purity, in the northern parts of Scotland; where its aid is highly nece&s;&s;ary in managing the numerous herds of Sheep bred in tho&s;e exten&s;ive wilds.</P>

<P>is a tru&s;ty and u&s;eful &s;ervant to the farmer and grazier; and, although it is not taken notice of by naturali&s;ts as a di&s;tinct race, yet it is now &s;o generally u&s;ed, e&s;pecially in the North of England, and &s;uch great attention is paid in breeding it, that we cannot help con&s;idering it as a permanent kind. They are chiefly employed in driving cattle; in which way they are extremely u&s;eful. They are larger, &s;tronger, and fiercer than the Shepherd's Dog; and their hair is &s;moother and &s;horter. They are mo&s;tly of a black and white colour. Their ears are half-prick|ed; and many of them are whelped with &s;hort tails, which &s;eem as if they had been cut: The&s;e are called <HI>Self-tailed Dogs.</HI> They bite very keenly; and as they al|ways make their attack at the heels, the cattle have no defence again&s;t them: In this way, they are more than a match for a Bull, which they quickly compel to run. Their &s;agacity is uncommonly great: They know their ma&s;ter's fields, and are &s;ingularly attentive to the cat|tle
<PB N="287" REF="294">
that are in them: A good Dog watches, goes his rounds; and, if any &s;trange cattle &s;hould happen to ap|pear among&s;t the herd, although unbidden, he quickly flies at them, and with keen bites obliges them to depart.</P>
<P>Similar to the Cur, is that which is commonly u&s;ed in driving cattle to the &s;laughter; and as the&s;e Dogs have frequently to go long journies, great &s;trength, as well as &s;wiftne&s;s, is required for that purpo&s;e: They are there|fore generally of a mixed kind; and unite in them the &s;everal qualities of the Shepherd's Dog, the Cur, the Ma&s;tiff, and the Greyhound. Thus, by a judicious mix|ture of different kinds, the &s;ervices of the Dog are ren|dered &s;till more various and exten&s;ive, and the great pur|po&s;es of dome&s;tic utility are more fully an&s;wered.</P>

<P>The Dogs of Kam&s;chatka are commonly black or white.

Captain King relates, that, during his &s;tay there, a courier with di&s;patches, drawn by them, performed a journey of 270 miles in le&s;s than four days.

Great care and attention are con&s;equently u&s;ed in training up tho&s;e for leaders, which are more valuable according to their &s;teadine&s;s and do|cility; the &s;um of forty roubles, or ten pounds, being

When they are inattentive to their duty, he often cha&s;|ti&s;es them by throwing it at them. He di&s;covers great dexterity in regaining his &s;tick, which is the greate&s;t dif|ficulty attending his &s;ituation; for if he &s;hould happen to lo&s;e his &s;tick, the Dogs immediately di&s;cover the circum|&s;tance, and &s;eldom fail to &s;et off at full &s;peed, and con|tinue to run till their &s;trength is exhau&s;ted, or till the carriage is overturned, and da&s;hed to pieces, or hurried down a precipice.</P>
<NOTE N="&dtristar;" PLACE="foot">In December, 1784, one of the&s;e Dogs was left by a &s;mug|gling ve&s;&s;el near Boomer, on the coa&s;t of Northumberland; finding him&s;elf de&s;erted, he began to worry Sheep, and in that way did &s;o much damage, that he became the terror of the country within a circuit of above twenty miles.

The farmers were &s;o much alarmed by his depredations, that various means were u&s;ed for his de&s;truction.

<P>The uncommon ardour of the&s;e Dogs in fighting will be be&s;t illu&s;trated by the following fact, related by an eye-witne&s;s; which at the &s;ame time corroborates, in &s;ome degree, that wonderful account of the Dogs of Epirus, given by Elian, and quoted by Dr Gold&s;mith in his hi&s;tory of the Dog. &mdash; Some years ago, at a bull|baiting in the North of England, when that barbarous cu&s;tom was very common, a young man, confident of the courage of his Dog, laid &s;ome trifling wagers, that

he would, at &s;eparate times, cut off all the four feet of his Dog; and that, after every amputation, it would attack the Bull. The cruel experiment was tried, and the Dog continued to &s;eize the Bull as eagerly as if he had been perfectly whole.</P>

<P>Dr Caius, in his curious treati&s;e on Briti&s;h Dogs, tells us, that three of the&s;e animals were reckoned a match for a Bear, and four for a Lion.</P>
<P>We have a curious account, recorded in Stow's An|nals, of an engagement between three Ma&s;tiffs and a Lion, in the pre&s;ence of James the Fir&s;t. "One of the Dogs being put into the den, was &s;oon di&s;abled by the Lion; which took it by the head and neck, and drag|ged it about: Another Dog was then let loo&s;e, and &s;erved in the &s;ame manner: But the third being put in, immediately &s;eized the Lion by the lip, and held him for a con&s;iderable time; till being &s;everely torn by his claws, the Dog was obliged to quit its hold; and the Lion, greatly exhau&s;ted in the conflict, refu&s;ed to renew the engagement; but taking a &s;udden leap over the Docs, fled into the interior part of his den. Two of the Dogs &s;oon died of their wounds: The la&s;t &s;urvived, and was taken great care of by the king's &s;on; who &s;aid, "he that had fought with the king of bea&s;ts, "hould never after fight with any inferior creature."</P>

<P>The drawing of this Dog was taken from a very fine one at E&s;lington, in the county of Northumberland; its dimen&s;ions were as follow:&mdash;From its no&s;e to the end of its tail, it mea&s;ured &s;ix feet two inches; the length of its tail one foot ten inches; from one fore-foot right over its &s;houlders to the other, five feet &s;even inches; girt behind the &s;houlder, three feet two inches; round its head over its ears, two feet; round the upper part of its fore-leg, nine inches and a half. It is web-footed, can &s;wim extremely fa&s;t, dive with great ea&s;e, and bring up any thing from the bottom of the water. It is natural|ly fond of fi&s;h, and eats raw trouts, or other &s;mall fi&s;h, out of the nets.</P>
<P>This breed of Dogs was originally brought from the country of which they bear the name, where their great
<PB N="307" REF="314">
&s;trength and docility render them extremely u&s;eful to the fi&s;hers on tho&s;e coa&s;ts, who u&s;e them in bringing down wood from the interior parts of the country to the &s;ea|&s;ide; three or four of them yoked to a &s;ledge, will draw two or three hundred weight of wood piled upon it, for &s;everal miles, with great ea&s;e; they are not attended with a driver nor any per&s;on to guide them, but after having delivered their loading, they return immediately to the woods, where they are accu&s;tomed to be fed with dried fi&s;h, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The extraordinary &s;agacity of the&s;e Dogs, and their at|tachment to their ma&s;ters, render them highly valuable in particular &s;ituations. Among the innumerable in&s;tances, wherein they have di&s;played tho&s;e faculties, the following anecdotes appear to be not unworthy of notice:&mdash;</P>
<P>During a &s;evere &s;torm, in the winter of 1789, a &s;hip, belonging to Newca&s;tle, was lo&s;t near Yarmouth, and a Newfoundland Dog alone e&s;caped to the &s;hore, bringing in his mouth the captain's pocket-book; he landed amid&s;t a number of people that were a&s;&s;embled, &s;everal of whom in vain endeavoured to take it from him. The &s;agacious animal, as if &s;en&s;ible of the importance of the charge, which in all probability was delivered to him by his per|i&s;hing ma&s;ter, at length leaped fawningly again&s;t the brea&s;t of a man, who had attracted his notice among the crowd, and delivered the book to him. The Dog im|mediately returned to the place where he had landed, and watched with great attention for every thing that came from the wrecked ve&s;&s;el, &s;eizing them, and endeavouring to bring them to land.</P>
<P>The following is another in&s;tance of their great do|cility, and &s;trength of ob&s;ervation:&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="315">A gentleman walking by the &s;ide of the river Tyne, and ob&s;erving, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, a child fall into the water, gave notice to his Dog, which immediately jump|ed in, &s;wam over, and, catching hold of the child with its mouth, brought it &s;afe to land.</P>

There are few who have not &s;een an unfortunate object of this de&s;cription led by his Dog, through the various pa&s;&s;ages of a populous town, to the accu&s;tomed place where he fits to &s;upplicate the contri|butions of pa&s;&s;engers. It may &s;ometimes be &s;een to &s;top at particular hou&s;es, to receive the mor&s;el from the hand of charity, or pick from the ground the money thrown out to relieve him. When the day is pa&s;&s;ed, it conducts him home again; and gratefully receives, as the reward of its &s;ervices, the &s;canty pittance which poverty and wretchedne&s;s can be&s;tow.</P>
<P>Dogs will &s;ometimes imitate the actions of their ma&s;|ters, will open a door that is fa&s;tened with a latch, or pull a bell, where they are de&s;irous of gaining admit|tance.&mdash;Faber mentions one, belonging to a nobleman of the Medici family, which always attended at its ma&s;ter's table, took from him his plates, and brought him others; and, if he wanted wine, would carry it to him, in a gla&s;s placed upon a &s;ilver plate, which it held in its mouth, without &s;pilling the &s;malle&s;t drop. The &s;ame Dog would al&s;o hold the &s;tirrups in its teeth, whil&s;t its ma&s;ter was mounting his hor&s;e.</P>
<P>That the&s;e animals are capable of mutual attachment, is evident, from the well-known &s;tory of the Dog at St Alban's; which, being left by its ma&s;ter at an inn there till he returned from London, and being ill-treated by a large Dog belonging to the hou&s;e, &s;tole privately off; and returning again with a friend, that was much larger and &s;tronger than it&s;elf, they both fell upon the aggre&s;|&s;or,

and puni&s;hed him &s;everely for his cruelty to a &s;tran|ger.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal peculiarities common to all animals of the Dog kind, briefly mentioned by Linnaeus, with which we &s;hall conclude its hi&s;tory; the principal of which are as follow:&mdash;The Dog is carnivorous; its &s;to|mach dige&s;ts bones; it eats gra&s;s for a vomit; voids its urine &s;ideways, and commonly where other Dogs have done &s;o before; &s;mells at a &s;tranger; &s;carcely ever &s;weats, but lolls out its tongue when hot; remembers injuries done to it; is &s;ubject to the hydrophobia; its &s;en&s;e of hearing very quick; when a&s;leep, is &s;uppo&s;ed to dream; goes with young &s;ixty-three days, and commonly brings forth from four to eight at one time. It barks at &s;trange Dogs, &s;naps at a &s;tone thrown at it, howls at certain mu|&s;ical notes: When about to lie down, frequently goes round the place; fawns at the approach of its ma&s;ter, and will not patiently &s;uffer any one to &s;trike him; runs before him on a journey, often going over the &s;ame ground; on coming to cro&s;s ways, &s;tops, looks back, and waits to ob&s;erve which of them he takes; &s;its up and begs; and, when it has committed a theft, &s;links away with its tail between its legs; is an enemy to beg|gars and ill-looking people, and attacks them without the lea&s;t provocation; is al&s;o &s;aid to be &s;ick at the approach of bad weather.&mdash;We cannot, however, agree with the learned naturali&s;t, when he a&s;&s;erts, that the male pup|pies re&s;emble the Dog, and the female the Bitch; or that it is a character common to the whole &s;pecies, that the tail always bends to the left &s;ide. To the&s;e we may add, as equally void of foundation, a remark of M. Buf|fon, that a female Hound, covered with a Dog of her
<PB N="320" REF="327">
own kind, has been known to produce a mixed race, con&s;i&s;ting of Hounds and Terriers.&mdash;We barely mention the&s;e, to &s;hew, that too much caution cannot be u&s;ed in forming general characters or &s;y&s;tematic arrangements; and we leave it to the experience of the mo&s;t inattentive ob&s;erver to detect &s;uch palpable ab&s;urdities.</P>

</FIGURE> THE HARE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS harmle&s;s and inoffen&s;ive animal, de&s;titute of every means of defence, and &s;urrounded on all &s;ides by its enemies, would &s;oon be utterly extirpated, if Nature, ever kind and provident, had not endowed it with faculties, by which it is frequently enabled to evade their pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>Fearful of every danger, and attentive to every alarm, the Hare is continually upon the watch; and being pro|vided with very long ears, moveable at plea&s;ure, and ea&s;ily directed to every quarter, is warned of the mo&s;t di&s;tant approaches of danger. Its eyes are large and prominent, adapted to receive the rays of light on every &s;ide, and give notice of more immediate alarms. To the&s;e may be added its great &s;wiftne&s;s, by which it &s;oon leaves mo&s;t of its pur&s;uers far behind.&mdash;The hind are much longer than the fore legs, and are furni&s;hed with &s;trong mu&s;cles, which give the Hare a &s;ingular advan|tage in running again&s;t a hill; and, as if &s;en&s;ible of its
<PB N="322" REF="329">
powers in this re&s;pect, it is always ob&s;erved to fly to|wards ri&s;ing ground when fir&s;t &s;tarted.</P>
<P>It is curious to ob&s;erve how admirably every limb and member of this creature is formed for &s;peed.&mdash;Thus made for e&s;cape, the Hare might be &s;uppo&s;ed to enjoy a &s;tate of tolerable &s;ecurity; but as every rapacious crea|ture is its enemy, it is &s;eldom permitted to live out its natural term. Dogs and Foxes pur&s;ue it by in&s;tinct; Wild Cats, and Wea&s;els of all kinds, catch and devour it; birds of prey are &s;till more dangerous enemies; whil&s;t man, far more powerful than all, makes u&s;e of every artifice to obtain an animal which con&s;titutes one of the numerous delicacies of his table.&mdash;If we were to enumerate the various &s;tratagems which ingenuity has &s;ugge&s;ted to circumvent this per&s;ecuted creature, we would willingly omit the notable atchievements and gal|lant exploits of the cha&s;e; which, to a cool and di&s;pa&s;|&s;ionate ob&s;erver, &s;eem to demand a nobler game.</P>
<Q>Poor is the triumph o'er the timid Hare.</Q>
<P>Another remarkable means of &s;afety to the Hare is its colour, which being &s;imilar to the ground where it &s;its, &s;ecures it from the &s;ight of its enemies; and, as a fur|ther in&s;tance of the care of Providence in the pre&s;erva|tion of its creatures, the&s;e, as well as &s;ome other ani|mals in more northern regions, are ob&s;erved to change their colour and become perfectly white during winter, which renders them le&s;s con&s;picuous in the &s;now.&mdash;Some rare in&s;tances occur, of white Hares being met with in Great-Britain.</P>
<P>The Hare is a very prolific animal, and breeds three or four times in the year. The females go with young
<PB N="323" REF="330">
thirty days, and generally bring forth three or four at a litter. The rutting &s;ea&s;on begins in February.</P>
<P>During the day, Hares &s;leep or repo&s;e in their &s;eats, and &s;eldom remove from them: The night is the &s;ea&s;on when they go about in &s;earch of food; and they are &s;ure to return to their forms or &s;eats by the &s;ame paths which they took in leaving them.</P>
<Q><L>'Tis in&s;tinct that directs the jealous Hare</L>
<L>To chu&s;e her &s;oft abode. With &s;tep revers'd,</L>
<L>She forms the doubling maze; then, ere the morn</L>
<L>Peeps through the clouds, leaps to her clo&s;e rece&s;s.</L></Q>
<P>The fur of the Hare is of great u&s;e in making hats; for which purpo&s;e many thou&s;ands of their &s;kins are an|nually imported from Ru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>The Hare was reckoned a great delicacy among the Romans; but was forbidden to the Jews, and held &s;a|cred among the ancient Britons, who religiou&s;ly ab&s;tain|ed from eating it.&mdash;We are told, that Boadicea, immedi|ately before her la&s;t conflict with the Romans, let loo&s;e a Hare &s;he had concealed in her bo&s;om; which, taking what was deemed a fortunate cour&s;e, was looked upon as a good omen.&mdash;It is to this day deemed unclean by the Mahometans.</P>
<P>The Hare is found in mo&s;t parts of the world, with very little variety. Tho&s;e of North-America are rather le&s;s than the European, frequent mar&s;hes and meadows, and when pur&s;ued take refuge in hollow trees.</P>

</FIGURE> THE RABBIT.</HEAD>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the great &s;imilarity be|tween the Hare and the Rabbit, Nature has placed an in&s;eparable bar between them, in not allow|ing them to intermix, to which they mutually di&s;cover the mo&s;t extreme aver&s;ion: Be&s;ides this, there is a wide difference in their habits and propen&s;ities: The Rabbit lives in holes in the earth, where it brings forth its young, and retires from the approach of danger; whil&s;t the Hare prefers the open fields, and tru&s;ts to its &s;peed for &s;afety.</P>
<P>The fecundity of the Rabbit is truly a&s;toni&s;hing: It breeds &s;even times in the year, and generally produces eight young at a time; from which it is calculated, that one pair may increa&s;e, in the cour&s;e of four years, to the amazing number of 1,274,840: So that, if frequent re|ductions were not made in various ways, there is rea&s;on to apprehend they would &s;oon exceed the means of their &s;upport, and over-run the face of the country. But as their increa&s;e is great, &s;o is the number of their enemies; for, be&s;ides tho&s;e that are taken for the u&s;e of man, great
<PB N="326" REF="333">
numbers are devoured by Foxes, Wea&s;els, Foumarts, and other bea&s;ts of prey.&mdash;In Spain, they formerly increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, as to become obnoxious; and the inha|bitants were obliged to procure Ferrets from Africa to de&s;troy them.</P>
<P>The Rabbit is capable of procreating at the age of five or &s;ix months. The female goes with young about thir|ty days. Previous to her bringing forth, &s;he makes a bed with down, that &s;he pulls off her own coat. She ne|ver leaves her young but when pre&s;&s;ed with hunger, and returns as &s;oon as that is allayed, which &s;he does with &s;urprizing quickne&s;s. During the time &s;he tends and &s;uckles her young, &s;he carefully conceals them from the male, le&s;t he &s;hould devour them; and frequently covers up the mouth of the hole, that her retreat may not be di&s;covered.</P>
<P>The Rabbit lives to the age of eight or nine years, and prefers warm and temperate climates.&mdash;Pliny and Ari&s;|totle mention it as being anciently known only in Greece and Spain; it is now, however, common in various parts of Europe.&mdash;In Sweden and other cold countries, it can only be reared in hou&s;es.</P>
<P>This animal abounds in Great-Britain, where its &s;kin forms a very con&s;iderable article in the manufacture of hats. Lincoln&s;hire, Norfolk, and Cambridge&s;hire, are mo&s;t noted for the production of them.</P>

<P>The RABBIT OF ANGORA, like the Goat and Sheep of that country, is covered with long hair, which falls down its &s;ide in wavy curls, and is of a &s;ilky &s;inene&s;s.</P>
<P>In Ru&s;&s;ia, there is a very remarkable variety of the Rabbit, having a double &s;kin over the back, into which it can withdraw its head: It likewi&s;e conceals its fore legs in a part which falls down under the throat. There are &s;mall holes in this loo&s;e &s;kin on the back, which ad|mit light to the eyes.

<P>THIS little animal, though a native of Brazil, lives and propagates in temperate, and even in cold cli|mates, when protected from the inclemency of the &s;ea|&s;ons.&mdash;Great numbers are kept in a dome&s;tic &s;tate; but for what purpo&s;e can hardly be determined. They have neither beauty nor utility to recommend them; their &s;kins are of little value; and their fle&s;h, though eatable, is far from being good. Their habits and di&s;po&s;ition are equally unplea&s;ant and di&s;gu&s;ting: Void of attachment even to their own offspring, they &s;uffer them to be de|voured the moment they are brought forth, without making the &s;malle&s;t attempt to defend them. The males frequently de&s;troy their own young; and are &s;o &s;tupid, as to allow them&s;elves to be killed by Cats, without re|&s;i&s;tance. They pa&s;s their whole lives in &s;leeping, eating, and in the propagation of their &s;pecies. They are by na|ture gentle and tame; they do no mi&s;chief, but &s;eem to be equally incapable of good.&mdash;Rats are &s;aid to avoid the places where they re&s;ide.</P>

<P>THIS beautiful little animal is equally admirable for the neatne&s;s and elegance of its formation, as for its liveline&s;s and activity. Its di&s;po&s;ition is gentle and harmle&s;s; though naturally wild, it is &s;oon familiari&s;ed to confinement and re&s;traint; and though exce&s;&s;ively ti|mid, it is ea&s;ily taught to receive with freedom the mo&s;t familiar care&s;&s;es from the hand that feeds it. It u&s;ually lives in woods, and makes its ne&s;t of mo&s;s or dry leaves in the hollows of trees; it &s;eldom de&s;cends upon the ground, but leaps from tree to tree with great agility. Its food con&s;i&s;ts of fruits, almonds, nuts, acorns, &amp;c. of which it accumulates great &s;tores for winter provi&s;ions, and &s;ecures them carefully near its ne&s;t. In the &s;ummer it feeds on buds and young &s;hoots, and is particularly fond of the cones of the fir and pine trees. The &s;pring is the &s;ea&s;on of love with Squirrels; at that time the males pur&s;ue the females, and exhibit wonderful proofs of agility, whil&s;t the latter, as if to make trial of the con|&s;tancy

of their lovers, &s;eem to avoid them by a variety of entertaining &s;allies, and, like true coquets, feign an e&s;cape, by way of enhancing the value of the conque&s;t. They bring forth four or five young at a time.</P>
<P>The Squirrel is of a bright-brown colour, inclining to red; the brea&s;t and belly are white; the ears are orna|mented with long tufts of hair; the eyes are large, black, and lively; the fore teeth &s;trong and &s;harp; the fore legs are curiou&s;ly furni&s;hed with long &s;tiff hairs, which pro|ject on each &s;ide like whi&s;kers. When it eats it &s;its erect, and u&s;es its fore paws as hands to convey food to its mouth. The tail of the Squirrel is its greate&s;t orna|ment, and &s;erves as a defence from the cold, being large enough to cover the whole body; it likewi&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;ts it in taking leaps from one tree to another; and we may add a third application of it, which would &s;eem altogether improbable, if we were not a&s;&s;ured of it by Linnaeus and other naturali&s;ts:&mdash;In attempting to cro&s;s a lake or river, the Squirrel places it&s;elf upon a piece of bark, and, erecting its tail to catch the wind, boldly commits it&s;elf to the mercy of the waves. The &s;malle&s;t gu&s;t of wind is &s;ufficient to over&s;et a whole navy of the&s;e little adventu|rers, and in &s;uch perilous voyages many hundreds of them are &s;aid to peri&s;h.</P>
<P>Of the Squirrel there are &s;everal varieties, &s;ome of which are to be found in almo&s;t every country; but they chiefly abound in northern and temperate climates. The Hud&s;on's-Bay Squirrel is &s;maller than the European; it is marked along the middle of the back with a du&s;ky line, from head to tail; the belly is of a pale-a&s;h colour, m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ttled with black; and the tail, which is du&s;ky and
<PB N="335" REF="342">
barred with black, is not &s;o long, nor &s;o full of hair, as the common kind.</P>
<P>The GREY SQUIRREL is about the &s;ize of a young Rabbit; its ears are &s;hort, and not tufted at the ends; its hair is grey, mixed with black; on each &s;ide there is a red &s;treak which runs lengthways; its tail is long and bu&s;hy, of a grey colour, variegated with black and white. It is common to both continents; in Sweden and other northern countries it changes its colour in the winter. It is very numerous in North-America, and does incredi|ble damage to the plantations; great flocks of them de|&s;cend from the mountains, and lay wa&s;te the fields of maize, by eating the young ears. A reward of three-pence per head was given for every one that was killed; and &s;uch numbers were de&s;troyed in one year, that Pen|&s;ylvania alone paid in rewards the &s;um of 8000 l. of its currency.</P>
<P>The Grey Squirrel makes its ne&s;t in hollow trees, with mo&s;s, &s;traw, wool, &amp;c. It lays up &s;tores of provi|&s;ions in holes made in the ground, which it vi&s;its occa|&s;ionally when in want of meat: The&s;e are often de&s;troy|ed by Swine; and &s;ometimes &s;o long covered with &s;now, that the Squirrels peri&s;h for want of food.

<P>The fur of the&s;e animals is very valuable, and is im|ported under the name of <HI>petit-gris.</HI></P>
<P>The BLACK SQUIRREL is about the &s;ame &s;ize and form with the la&s;t, but its tail is not &s;o long: It is ge|nerally black, with white on the no&s;e, ears, and end of

the tail. Its di&s;po&s;ition and habits are &s;o &s;imilar to the Grey Squirrel, that it might be taken for a variety of that kind; but it is &s;aid to a&s;&s;ociate in &s;eparate troops, and is equally numerous.</P>
<P>This creature is found in the northern parts of A&s;ia, North-America, and Mexico. In the latter country, there is a variety with plain round ears; the upper part of the body variegated with black, white, and brown.&mdash; It is twice the &s;ize of the common Squirrel, lives under ground, where it brings forth its young, and lays in its &s;tock of provi&s;ions. It feeds on maize; and is extremely lively, gentle, and docile. It is the <HI>Coquallin</HI> of M. Buf|fon.</P>

<P>is very numerous in the fore&s;ts of North-America, as well as the North of A&s;ia.&mdash;It burrows in the ground, and makes two entrances to its habitation; that if one &s;hould be &s;topped up, it may have acce&s;s by the other.

by a &s;tore-hou&s;e, in which its winter food is depo&s;ited: In one is contained acorns, in another nuts, in a third maize, and in another che&s;nuts, which are its favourite food.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals &s;eldom &s;tir out during winter, or &s;o long as their provi&s;ions la&s;t; when tho&s;e fail, they &s;ome|times work their way into places where apples are laid up, or into barns where maize is &s;tored, and make great havock. During harve&s;t, they fill their mouths &s;o full with corn, that their cheeks are quite di&s;tended, and carry it off to their concealed &s;tore. They give great preference to certain kinds of food; and if, after filling their mouths with rye, they chance to meet with wheat, they di&s;charge the former, that they may &s;ecure the lat|ter.</P>
<P>The Ground Squirrel is marked with a &s;tripe of black, which runs along the ridge of the back; and on each &s;ide a yellow &s;tripe, bordered with black; its head, bo|dy, and tail, are of a reddi&s;h-brown; brea&s;t and belly white; its no&s;e and feet of a pale-red colour; its eyes full and lively. It is very wild, bites &s;everely, and is tamed with difficulty. Its &s;kin is of little value.</P>

<P>In the act of leaping, the loo&s;e &s;kin is &s;tretched out by the feet; whereby the &s;urface of the body is aug|mented, the animal becomes lighter in proportion to its bulk, the acceleration of its fall is retarded, and it ap|pears to &s;ail or fly from one place to another. Where a

<P>There are &s;everal kinds, differing much in &s;ize.&mdash;In the i&s;lands of the Ea&s;t-Indies, there is a variety as large as a Hare, called the TAGUAN, or GREAT FLYING SQUIRREL; which perfectly re&s;embles the other in fi|gure, and in the form of its lateral membrane.

</FIGURE> THE MARMOT</HEAD>
<P>HAS been placed by naturali&s;ts in the &s;ame cla&s;s with the Hare and the Rat kind; and on exa|mining its parts, we find a partial agreement with both the&s;e animals. In its no&s;e and lips, as well as in the general form of its head, it re&s;embles the Hare; its ears are like tho&s;e of the Rat, with which it likewi&s;e agrees in the number and form of its teeth and claws. In other re&s;pects, it is no way &s;imilar to either of tho&s;e kinds; and it is &s;till farther &s;eparated from them by ha|bitudes which &s;eem peculiar to it&s;elf, and di&s;tingui&s;h it from almo&s;t every other &s;pecies of quadrupeds.</P>
<P>The Marmot inhabits the highe&s;t regions of the Alps; it is likewi&s;e found in Poland, Ukraine, and Chine&s;e Tartary; is &s;omewhat le&s;s than a Hare; its ears are round, and &s;o &s;hort, that they are almo&s;t hid in the fur; its tail is &s;hort and bu&s;hy; the hair on the back is of a browni&s;h-a&s;h colour; and that on the belly reddi&s;h, &s;oft, and bu&s;hy; its voice re&s;embles the murmuring of a young puppy; when irritated or frightened, it makes a whi&s;tling noi&s;e, very loud and piercing to the ear. It feeds on in&s;ects, roots, and vegetables; but when tamed, is remarkably fond of milk and butter. It lives in holes,
<PB N="344" REF="351">
formed with great art in the &s;ide of a mountain: There are two entrances to each; and the chamber to which they lead is deep and &s;pacious; the bottom is lined with mo&s;s and hay, of which the&s;e provident animals lay in a &s;tore during &s;ummer; and, at the approach of winter, &s;hut them&s;elves up in their holes by &s;topping the en|trances with earth, &s;o effectually, that no di&s;covery can be made of the place of their retreat. The chamber in which they lodge is large enough to contain a family of from five to a dozen Marmots: They roll them&s;elves up; and being well covered with hay, remain in a tor|pid &s;tate, in&s;en&s;ible to the rigours of the &s;ea&s;on, and per|fectly &s;ecure from the &s;torm that rages without; till the chearing influence of the &s;un again calls them out to re|new their exhau&s;ted &s;trength, to propagate their kind, and provide for their future retreat. The torpid &s;tate la&s;ts from about Michaelmas till April. They go in ex|tremely fat, but gradually wa&s;te; and at the end of their long &s;leep, they appear lean and extremely emaciated.</P>
<P>The Marmot produces once a year; and the litter ge|nerally con&s;i&s;ts of three or four.&mdash;When a number of them are feeding together, they place one as a centinel, which makes a whi&s;tling noi&s;e on the lea&s;t appearance of interruption; and the party immediately betake them|&s;elves to their holes, the centinel driving up the rear.</P>
<P>The Marmot is a very playful animal, and is ea&s;ily tamed. It learns to hold a &s;tick, to dance, and to exhi|bit various ge&s;tures: It will obey the voice of its ma&s;ter; and, like the Cat, has an antipathy to Dogs, which it attacks fiercely upon the lea&s;t irritation. It is very apt to gnaw linen or woollen &s;tuffs: It often &s;its upright, or walks with ea&s;e on its hind feet: It eats in the manner

<P>Although the qualities of this animal are &s;ufficiently noxious to render it an object of univer&s;al dete&s;tation, in tho&s;e countries where it abounds; yet, when con&s;idered with regard to tho&s;e in&s;tincts which conduce to its own pre&s;ervation and &s;upport, it well de&s;erves our highe&s;t ad|miration. Its habitation is curious, and con&s;tructed with great art: It con&s;i&s;ts of a variety of apartments, adapted to various purpo&s;es, and extremely well fitted both for the comfort and convenience of the inhabitants. The fir&s;t entrance is formed in an oblique direction, at the end of which the male &s;inks a perpendicular hole, which he re&s;erves for his own u&s;e. The female makes &s;everal, for the accommodation of her&s;elf and family, that her young, during the &s;hort time they are allowed to &s;tay with her, may have a free pa&s;&s;age to the general &s;tores. One of the holes is lined with &s;traw, and &s;erves as a lodg|ing; the others contain provi&s;ions, of which great quan|tities are always accumulated during the time of har|ve&s;t. They begin to lay in their &s;tores in Augu&s;t. To facilitate the tran&s;portation of their food, nature has fur|ni&s;hed them with two pouches in each cheek, into which they cram corn, beans, or pea&s;e, till they &s;eem ready to
<PB N="348" REF="355">
bur&s;t; and, on their return to their holes, empty them, by pre&s;&s;ing their two fore feet again&s;t their cheeks. The quantity of provi&s;ion found in the&s;e magazines, depends on the age or &s;ex of the inhabitants. The old Ham&s;ters often ama&s;s an hundred pounds weight of grain, but the young and the females are &s;atisfied with much le&s;s. At the approach of winter, the Ham&s;ters retire into their &s;ubterraneous abodes, the entry to which they &s;hut up with great care. There they remain in perfect tranquil|lity, and feed on their provi&s;ions till the fro&s;t becomes &s;evere, when they &s;ink into a torpid &s;tate, in which they continue till the return of &s;pring. During this period, if any of the holes be opened, the Ham&s;ter is always found lying upon a bed of &s;oft &s;traw, with its head turn|ed under its belly, between the two fore legs, whil&s;t the hind ones re&s;t upon the muzzle. Its eyes are &s;hut, every member perfectly &s;tiff, and &s;en&s;ation &s;o totally &s;u&s;pended, that neither re&s;piration nor any other &s;ign of life can be perceived. When di&s;&s;ected in this &s;ituation, the heart may be &s;een alternately contracting and dilating very &s;lowly; the fat appears to be coagulated, and the inte&s;|tines are quite cold; during this operation the animal &s;eems to feel very little, it &s;ometimes opens its mouth as if it wanted to re&s;pire, but the lethargy is too &s;trong to admit of its entirely awaking. The Ham&s;ters copulate about the end of April, when the males enter the apart|ments of the females, but remain only a few days. If two males happen to meet in the &s;ame hole, a furious combat en&s;ues, which generally terminates in the death of the weaker. The females bring forth twice or thrice every year, each litter con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix or eight; in about three weeks the young are driven from their holes, and
<PB N="349" REF="356">
left to provide for them&s;elves. Their increa&s;e is &s;o rapid in &s;ome years, as to be almo&s;t &s;ufficient to occa&s;ion a dearth; but the ferocity with which they upon all occa|&s;ions attack and devour each other is &s;o great, as to be the happy means of preventing the ill effects of their fe|cundity. It is not only its own &s;pecies to which the fury of the Ham&s;ter is directed; he attacks and devours every animal without di&s;tinction that he is able to conquer, and frequently oppo&s;es him&s;elf to enemies much &s;uperior to him&s;elf in &s;trength. Rather than fly, he allows him&s;elf to be beaten to death. If he &s;eize a man's hand, he mu&s;t be killed before he can be made to quit his hold. A Hor&s;e or a Dog are equally objects of his rage; and where-ever he &s;eizes, it is with difficulty he can be di&s;|engaged.</P>
<P>The Ham&s;ter is about the &s;ize of a large Water-Rat, has a &s;hort tail almo&s;t naked; its colour on the head and back a reddi&s;h-brown, not unlike that of a Hare; its throat is white, and it has three white &s;pots on each &s;ide; its brea&s;t and belly are black. It is found in various parts of Germany, Poland, and Ukraine. The Pole-Cat is its greate&s;t enemy; it pur&s;ues the Ham&s;ter into its hole, and de&s;troys great numbers. Mr Ray ob&s;erves, that the hair of this animal is &s;o clo&s;ely united to the &s;kin, that it cannot be pulled off without great difficulty; on which account it is held in high e&s;timation.</P>

Myriads of them march in regular lines, about three feet a&s;under, in a South-Ea&s;t direction. Neither fire nor water &s;tops their progre&s;s: They go &s;traight forward with the mo&s;t amazing per&s;everance; they &s;wim acro&s;s lakes and rivers; no oppo&s;ition impedes them: If thou&s;ands are de&s;troyed, thou&s;ands &s;upply their places: The void is quickly filled up; and their number does not appear dimini&s;hed: They per&s;i&s;t in their cour&s;e in &s;pite of every ob&s;tacle; and from the time they &s;et out, never think of retreating; but if prevented from proceeding by any ob&s;tacle, they either by a&s;&s;iduity &s;ur|mount

it, or die in the attempt. Their march is mo&s;tly in the night. They re&s;t during the day, and devour eve|ry root and vegetable they meet with. They infect the very herbage; and cattle are &s;aid to peri&s;h that feed upon the gra&s;s they have touched.</P>
<P>An enemy &s;o numerous and de&s;tructive would &s;oon render the countries they pa&s;s through utterly uninha|bitable, did it not fortunately happen that the &s;ame rapa|city that excites them to lay wa&s;te the productions of the earth, at la&s;t impels them to de&s;troy each other. Having nothing more to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on, they are &s;aid to &s;eparate into two armies, which engage with the mo&s;t deadly hatred, and continue fighting and devouring each other till they are all entirely de&s;troyed. Thou&s;ands of them have been found dead; and the air infected by their putrid carca&s;es, &s;o as to occa&s;ion malignant di&s;tempers.</P>
<P>The Leming runs very &s;wiftly, although its legs are &s;hort and &s;lender. It is &s;omewhat le&s;s than the Rat: Its head is pointed; and in each jaw are two very long cutting teeth, with which it bites keenly; its ears are &s;hort, eyes &s;mall, fore legs &s;horter than the hind; the co|lour of the head and body black and tawny, di&s;po&s;ed in irregular patches; the belly white, tinged with yellow.&mdash; Though perfectly di&s;gu&s;ting to every other people, its fle&s;h is &s;aid to be eaten by the Laplanders.</P>

To the one we can oppo&s;e united powers and &s;uperior arts; with regard to the other, experience has convinced us, that no art can counteract the effects of its amazing fecundity, and that force is ineffectually oppo&s;ed to an enemy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch variety of means to elude it.</P>
<P>There are two kinds known in this country,&mdash;the Black Rat, which was formerly univer&s;al here, but is now very rarely &s;een, having been almo&s;t extirpated by the large brown kind, generally di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the NORWAY RAT. This formidable invader is now univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed through the whole country; from whence every method has been tried in vain to ex|terminate it.&mdash;This &s;pecies is about nine inches long; of a light-brown colour, mixed with tawny and a&s;h; the throat and belly are of a dirty-white, inclining to grey; its feet are naked, and of a pale-fle&s;h colour; the tail is
<PB N="355" REF="362">
as long as the body, covered with minute du&s;ky &s;cales, thinly inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;hort hairs.&mdash;In &s;ummer, it frequents the banks of rivers, ponds, and ditches; where it lives on frogs, fi&s;hes, and &s;mall animals. But its ra|pacity is not confined entirely to the&s;e: It de&s;troys rab|bits, poultry, young pigeons, &amp;c.: It infe&s;ts the grana|ry, the barn, and the &s;torehou&s;e; does infinite mi&s;chief among corn and fruit of all kinds; and, not content with &s;atisfying its hunger, frequently carries off large quanti|ties to its hiding place.&mdash;It is a bold and fierce little animal; and, when clo&s;ely pur&s;ued, will turn and fa&s;ten on its a&s;&s;ailant. Its bite is keen; and the wound it in|flicts is painful and difficult to heal, owing to the form of its teeth, which are long, &s;harp, and of an irregular form.</P>
<P>The Rat is amazingly prolific, u&s;ually producing from twelve to eighteen at one time. Their numbers would &s;oon increa&s;e beyond all power of re&s;traint, were it not for an in&s;atiable appetite, that imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ls them to de&s;troy and devour each other. The weaker always fall a prey to the &s;tronger; and the large male Rat, which u&s;ually lives by it&s;elf, is dreaded by tho&s;e of its own &s;pecies as their mo&s;t formidable enemy.</P>
<P>It is a &s;ingular fact, in the hi&s;tory of the&s;e animals, that the &s;kins of &s;uch of them as have been devoured in their holes have frequently been found, curiou&s;ly turned in&s;ide out; every part being completely inverted, even to the ends of the toes. How the operation is performed, it would be difficult to a&s;certain; but it appears to be ef|fected in &s;ome peculiar mode of eating out the contents.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the numbers that peri&s;h in the&s;e unnatural con|flicts, they have many fierce and inveterate enemies, that
<PB N="356" REF="363">
take every occa&s;ion to de&s;troy them. Several kinds of Dogs pur&s;ue them with great alacrity, and eagerly de|&s;troy them, though they invariably refu&s;e to eat their fle&s;h: The Cat is al&s;o a very formidable enemy, but ge|nerally finds greater difficulty in the conte&s;t: The Rat makes a vigorous re&s;i&s;tance, and &s;ometimes effects its e&s;cape. The Wea&s;el is the mo&s;t dangerous enemy of the Rat kind: It hunts them with uncea&s;ing avidity; pur&s;ues them into their holes, where it &s;oon kills them, and &s;ucks their blood. Mankind have likewi&s;e contrived various methods of de&s;troying the&s;e bold intruders: For that purpo&s;e traps are often found ineffectual; &s;uch be|ing their extreme &s;agacity, that when any are drawn in|to the &s;nare, the others by that means learn to avoid the dangerous allurement, notwith&s;tanding the utmo&s;t cau|tion may have been u&s;ed to conceal the de&s;ign. The &s;ure&s;t method of killing them is by poi&s;on: Nux vomi|ca ground, and mixed with oatmeal, with a &s;mall pro|portion of oil of rhodium and mu&s;k, have been found from experience to be very effectual.</P>

<P>THIS well-known little animal is diffu&s;ed in great numbers over almo&s;t every part of the world. It &s;eems a con&s;tant attendant on man, and is only to be found near his dwelling.

<P>THIS animal, de&s;tined to &s;eek its food and pro|vide for its &s;ub&s;i&s;tence under the &s;urface of the earth, is wonderfully adapted by the all-wi&s;e Author of nature to its peculiar mode of living. It enjoys the &s;en&s;es of hearing and &s;melling in a very eminent degree; the former gives noti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of every approach of danger; whil&s;t the latter enables it to find its prey in the mid&s;t of darkne&s;s, and compen&s;ates in a great mea&s;ure for an al|mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">otal want of &s;ight. To an animal &s;o circum&s;tanced a larger degree of vi&s;ion would be attended with manife&s;t inconveniences, as well as liable to continual injuries. We are told by anatomi&s;ts, that, for their better &s;ecurity, the eyes of the Mole are furni&s;hed with mu&s;cles, by which it has the power of withdrawing or exerting them at plea&s;ure. Its eyes are extremely &s;mall, and perfectly hid in the fur; but it is probable, they are &s;o formed, as to admit di&s;tinct images of the diminutive objects of its pur&s;uit. The form of this creature's body, and parti|cularly
<PB N="366" REF="373">
the con&s;truction of its fore feet, are admirably adapted to the purpo&s;e of making its way in the earth, which it does with wonderful facility: They are quite naked, very broad, with large palms, almo&s;t like a hand; five toes on each, terminated with &s;trong nails, very con|cave on the under &s;ide; and in place of a thumb, a &s;trong bone under the &s;kin; the hind feet very &s;mall, with five &s;lender toes, and a &s;mall thumb on the in&s;ide. Whenever it happens to be &s;urpri&s;ed on the &s;urface of the ground, it di&s;appears in an in&s;tant, and every at|tempt to prevent its &s;ubterraneous retreat would be vain.</P>
<P>The Mole is mo&s;tly found in grounds where the &s;oil is loo&s;e and &s;oft, and affords the greate&s;t quantity of worms and in&s;ects, on which it feeds. The female brings forth in the &s;pring, and generally produces four or five at a time: It makes its ne&s;t a little below the &s;urface of the ground, forming a commodious apartment, where it pre|pares a warm bed of mo&s;s and herbage; from this there are &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages in different directions, to which it can retreat with its young ones in ca&s;e of danger; into the&s;e likewi&s;e the animal makes excur&s;ions in que&s;t of food.&mdash;In the act of forming its tracks or runs, it throws up large heaps of mould, which are extremely trouble&s;ome and injurious in meadows, gra&s;s-lands, and cultivated grounds; its de&s;truction is con&s;equently an ob|ject of importance to farmers, gardeners, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>ANIMALS OF THE MONKEY KIND.</HEAD>
<P>WE come now to the de&s;cription of a numerous race of animals; con&s;i&s;ting of a greater variety of kinds, and making nearer approaches to the human &s;pecies, both in form and action, than any other cla&s;s of quadrupeds.</P>
<P>Monkies are found only in the warme&s;t parts of the world, and chiefly in the torrid zone: They abound in the woods of Africa, from Senegal to the Cape of Good Hope, and from thence to Ethiopia; in all parts of In|dia and its i&s;les; in the South of China; in Japan; and in South-America, from the I&s;thmus of Darien as far as Paraguay: A &s;pecies or two are al&s;o met with in Ara|bia and the province of Barbary.</P>
<P>On account of the numbers and different appearances of the&s;e animals, they have been divided into three cla&s;&s;es, and de&s;cribed under the following denominations, viz.&mdash;APES, or &s;uch as have no tails; BABOONS, or &s;uch as have &s;hort tails; MONKIES, or &s;uch as have long tails.</P>
<P>In the APE kind, we &s;ee the whole external machine &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with the human likene&s;s, and capable of &s;imilar exertions: They walk upright, their po&s;teriors are fle&s;hy, their legs are furni&s;hed with calves, and their hands and feet are nearly like ours.</P>
<P>In the BABOON, we perceive a more di&s;tant re&s;em|blance of the human form: He generally goes upon all four, &s;eldom upright, but when con&s;trained to it in a &s;tate of &s;ervitude. Some of them are as tall as a man. They have &s;hort tails, long faces, &s;unk eyes, are ex|tremely

<P>The MONKEY kind are removed &s;till farther, and are much le&s;s than the former.

<P>is the large&s;t of all the Ape kind, and makes the neare&s;t approach to the human figure. One of this kind, di&s;|&s;ected by Dr Ty&s;on, has been very accurately de&s;cribed by him. The principal external differences pointed out by that learned phy&s;ician, con&s;i&s;ted in the great length of the arms, and &s;hortne&s;s of the thighs; the thumb is al&s;o much &s;maller, and the palm of the hand longer and narrower, than in man; the form of the feet is very di&s;|&s;imilar, the toes being much longer, and the large toe placed at a greater di&s;tance from the others; the fore|head is too high, the no&s;e flat, and the eyes much &s;unk: Be&s;ide the&s;e, the anatomi&s;t has enumerated a variety of e&s;&s;ential differences in the internal conformation of the
<PB N="390" REF="397">
Oran-Outang, all of which &s;ufficiently evince, that, though he has the &s;tronge&s;t affinity to the human form of any other quadruped; yet, as Buffon elegantly ob|&s;erves, "the interval which &s;eparates the two &s;pecies is immen&s;e; the re&s;emblance in figure and organization, and the movements of imitation which &s;eem to re&s;ult from the&s;e &s;imilarities, neither make him approach the nature of man, nor elevate him above that of the brute."</P>
<P>The Oran-Outang is found in the interior parts of Africa, in Madaga&s;car, Borneo, and &s;ome parts of the Ea&s;t-Indies. It is a &s;olitary animal, avoids mankind, and lives only in the mo&s;t de&s;ert places. The large&s;t of the kind are &s;aid to be about &s;ix feet high, very active, &s;trong, and intrepid, capable of overcoming the &s;tronge&s;t man: They are likewi&s;e exceedingly &s;wift, and cannot ea&s;ily be taken alive. They live entirely on fruits and nuts, will &s;ometimes attack and kill the negroes who wander in the woods, and drive away the elephants that happen to approach too near the place of their re&s;idence: They &s;ometimes &s;urprize the female negroes, and carry them off into the woods, where they compel them to &s;tay with them.&mdash;When taken young, however, the Oran-Outang is capable of being tamed, and rendered extremely docile. One of them, &s;hewn in London &s;ome years ago, was taught to &s;it at table, make u&s;e of a &s;poon or fork in eating its victuals, and drink wine or other liquors out of a gla&s;s. It was extremely mild, affection|ate, and good-natured; much attached to its keeper, and obedient to his commands. Its a&s;pect was grave, and its di&s;po&s;ition melancholy. It was young, and only two feet four inches high. Its body was covered with hair of a black colour, which was much thicker and clo&s;er on
<PB N="391" REF="398">
the back than on the fore part of the body; the hands and &s;oles of the feet were naked, and of a du&s;ky colour.</P>
<P>A variety, called the PIGMY, is found in Guinea, Ethiopia, and other parts of Africa, much &s;maller than the la&s;t, being not more than a foot and a half in length. It is very tractable, good-natured, and ea&s;ily tamed; is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the <HI>Pithecos</HI> of the ancients. It lives in woods, and feeds on fruits and in&s;ects.&mdash;Troops of them a&s;&s;emble together, and defend them&s;elves from the attacks of wild bea&s;ts in the de&s;ert by throwing a cloud of &s;and behind them, which blinds their pur&s;uers, and facilitates their e&s;cape.</P>

<P>One of this kind was exhibited about twelve years ago in the North of England. It was five feet high, ex|tremely fierce, libidinous, and &s;trong. At the &s;ight of women, it di&s;covered marks of the mo&s;t violent pa&s;&s;ion; and at one time caught hold of a lady, who was &s;o in|cautious as to approach too near it; and &s;he was with &s;ome difficulty re&s;cued by the interference of the keeper.

companies: Some are employed in cutting down trees of great &s;ize, which is done by gnawing them with their teeth: The&s;e they lay acro&s;s the dam with &s;urprizing la|bour and per&s;everance, or form them into piles, which others roll down to the water, make holes at the bottom for receiving the ends, and placing them upright, &s;ecure them in that po&s;ition; whil&s;t another party is engaged in collecting twigs, interweaving and twi&s;ting them with the piles, and thereby &s;trengthening the work: Some collect large quantities of earth, &s;tones, clay, and other &s;olid materials, which they di&s;po&s;e of on the upper &s;ide of the piles next the &s;tream, forming a mound ten or twelve feet thick at the bottom, tapering gradually up|wards, and capable of &s;u&s;taining a con&s;iderable weight of water: The length of the dam, occa&s;ioned by this means, is &s;ometimes not le&s;s than one hundred feet.&mdash;Having compleated the mole, their next care is to erect their apartments, which are built on piles: They are of a cir|cular form, and generally con&s;i&s;t of three &s;tories, about eight feet high above the water: The fir&s;t lies below the level of the dam, and is generally full of water; the other two are above it. The walls are two feet in thick|ne&s;s, neatly plai&s;tered with clay on the in&s;ide, which is arched like an oven, and at the top re&s;embles a dome. In each hou&s;e there are two openings,&mdash;one toward the water, to which the animal has always acce&s;s in ca&s;e of &s;urprize; the other toward the land, by which it goes out in que&s;t of food.&mdash;The number of hou&s;es in one of the&s;e dams is from ten to twenty-five, &s;ome of them large enough to contain a family of twenty or thirty Bea|vers.

<P>ALTHOUGH the Otter is not con&s;idered by naturali&s;ts as wholly amphibious, it is neverthe|le&s;s enabled to remain a con&s;iderable time under water, and can pur&s;ue and take its prey in that element with great facility.&mdash;The legs are very &s;hort, but remarkably &s;trong, broad, and mu&s;cular; on each foot are five toes, connected by &s;trong membranes, like tho&s;e of water fowl; the head is broad, of an oval form, and flat on the upper part; the body is long and round, and the tail ta|pers to a point; the eyes are brilliant, and placed in &s;uch a manner, that the animal can &s;ee every object that is above it, which gives it a &s;ingular a&s;pect, very much re|&s;embling an eel or an a&s;p; the ears are &s;hort, and their orifice narrow. The fur of the Otter is of a deep-brown colour, with two &s;mall light &s;pots on each &s;ide of the no&s;e, and another under the chin.</P>
<P><PB N="432" REF="439">This animal makes its ne&s;t in &s;ome retired &s;pot by the &s;ide of a lake or river, under a bank, where it has an ea&s;y and &s;ecure acce&s;s to the water, to which it immedi|ately flies upon the lea&s;t alarm; and, as it &s;wims with great rapidity, generally e&s;capes from its pur&s;uers.&mdash;It de&s;troys great quantities of fi&s;h; and, in pur&s;uit of its prey, has been ob&s;erved commonly to &s;wim again&s;t the &s;tream.&mdash;As &s;oon as the Otter has caught a fi&s;h, it im|mediately drags it to the &s;hore; devours a part, as far as the vent; and, unle&s;s pre&s;&s;ed by extreme hunger, always leaves the remainder, and takes to the water in que&s;t of more.</P>
<P>Otters are generally taken in traps placed near their landing places, where they are carefully concealed in the &s;and.&mdash;When hunted with Dogs, the old ones defend them&s;elves with great ob&s;tinacy: They bite &s;everely, and do not readily quit their hold where they have once fa&s;|tened. An old Otter will never give up while it has life; nor make the lea&s;t complaint, though wounded ever &s;o much by the Dogs, or even when transfixed with a &s;pear.</P>
<P>There are many in&s;tances of Otters being tamed; but in tho&s;e which have come to our knowledge, they were taken when young, and accu&s;tomed by degrees to obedi|ence and re&s;traint. They became &s;o far dome&s;ticated, as to follow their ma&s;ters, an&s;wer to a name, and employ their excellent talents at fi&s;hing in their &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Some years ago, James Campbell, near Inverne&s;s, had a young Otter, which he brought up and tamed. It would follow him wherever he cho&s;e; and, if called on by its name, would immediately obey. When apprehen|&s;ive of danger from Dogs, it &s;ought the protection of its
<PB N="433" REF="440">
ma&s;ter, and would endeavour to fly into his arms for greater &s;ecurity.&mdash;It was frequently employed in catching fi&s;h, and would &s;ometimes take eight or ten &s;almon in a day. If not prevented, it always made an attempt to break the fi&s;h behind the fin next the tail; and as &s;oon as one was taken away, it immediately dived in pur&s;uit of more. When tired, it would refu&s;e to fi&s;h any lon|ger; and was then rewarded with as much fi&s;h as it could devour: Being &s;atisfied with eating, it always curled it&s;elf round, and fell a&s;leep; in which &s;tate it was generally carried home.&mdash;The &s;ame Otter fi&s;hed as well in the &s;ea as in a river, and took great numbers of codlings and other fi&s;h.&mdash;Its food was generally fre&s;h fi&s;h, and &s;ometimes milk.</P>
<P>Another per&s;on, who kept a tame Otter, &s;uffered it to follow him with his Dogs. It was very u&s;eful to him in fi&s;hing, by going into the water, and driving trouts and other fi&s;h towards the net.&mdash;It was remarkable, that the Dogs, though accu&s;tomed to the &s;port, were &s;o far from giving it the &s;malle&s;t mole&s;tation, that they would not even hunt an Otter whil&s;t it remained with them; on which account the owner was under the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;po&s;ing of it.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the Otter's avidity for fi&s;h, it will not eat it unle&s;s it be perfectly fre&s;h: When that cannot be procured, it is fed with milk, or pudding made of oat|meal, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Otters are found in mo&s;t parts of the world, with no great variation.&mdash;They are common in Guiana, and fre|quent the rivers and mar&s;hes of that country. They are &s;ometimes &s;een in great numbers together; and are &s;o
<PB N="434" REF="441">
fierce, that it is dangerous to come near them. They live in holes, which they make in the banks of the rivers.</P>
<P>The Otters of Cayenne are very large, weighing from ninety to one hundred pounds. They frequent the large rivers of that country. Their cry is loud, and may be heard to a great di&s;tance. They are of a dark-brown co|lour. Their fur is &s;horter than that of the Beaver, and very &s;oft.</P>
<P>The SMALL OTTER, found in Poland and the North of Europe, is much le&s;s than the common Otter, and of a du&s;ky-brown colour: Its feet are broad, webbed, and covered with hair; its fur is very valuable, being next in beauty to that of the Sable.</P>
<P>This Otter is found al&s;o in North-America, where it is called the MINX; frequents the water, and lives on fi&s;h; is fond of poultry; frequently &s;teals into the hen roo&s;ts, bites off the heads of the fowls, and &s;ucks their blood; is very fetid; and, when irritated, has a mo&s;t loath&s;ome &s;mell.&mdash;Its length, from no&s;e to tail, is twenty inches; tail four. Its fur is of a dark-brown colour, ve|ry glo&s;&s;y and beautiful.</P>

They di&s;|po&s;e of them to the Chine&s;e at the rate of &s;eventy or a hundred rubles each, and receive in return &s;ome of their mo&s;t valuable commodities.</P>
<P>The fur of the Sea-Otter is thick and long, of a beau|tiful &s;hining black colour, but &s;ometimes of a &s;ilvery hue; the legs are thick and &s;hort; toes joined by a web; the hind feet like tho&s;e of a Seal; length, from no&s;e to tail, four feet two inches; tail thirteen, flat, and point|ed at the end.&mdash;The large&s;t of them weigh from &s;eventy to eighty pounds.</P>

away. Before its young can &s;wim, it will carry it in its paws, and &s;upport it in the water, laying upon its back. &mdash;It &s;wims in various po&s;itions,&mdash;on its back, &s;ides, and even in a perpendicular po&s;ture; and in the water is very &s;portive.

<P>THERE are &s;everal animals di&s;tingui&s;hed by the common name of Ant-eaters, which differ great|ly in form.&mdash;They are divided into three cla&s;&s;es, viz. the Great, the Middle, and the Le&s;&s;er Ant-eater.</P>
<P>The GREAT ANT-EATER is nearly four feet in length, exclu&s;ive of its tail, which is two and a half. It is remarkable for the great length of its &s;nout, which is of a cylindrical form, and &s;erves as a &s;heath to its long and &s;lender tongue, which always lies folded double in its mouth, and is the chief in&s;trument by which it finds &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>This creature is a native of Brazil and Guiana, runs &s;lowly, frequently &s;wims over rivers, lives wholly on ants, which it collects by thru&s;ting its tongue into their holes; and, having penetrated every part of the ne&s;t, withdraws it into its mouth loaded with prey.&mdash;Its legs are &s;o &s;trong, that few animals can extricate them&s;elves
<PB N="440" REF="447">
from its gripe. It is &s;aid to be formidable even to the Panthers of America; and &s;ometimes fixes it&s;elf upon them in &s;uch a manner, that both of them fall and pe|ri&s;h together; for its ob&s;tinacy is &s;o great, that it will not extricate it&s;elf from its adver&s;ary even after he is dead.&mdash;The fle&s;h has a &s;trong di&s;agreeable ta&s;te, but is eaten by the Indians.</P>
<P>The MIDDLE ANT-EATER is one foot &s;even inches from no&s;e to tail. It inhabits the &s;ame countries, and procures its food in the &s;ame manner, as the la&s;t. Its tail is ten inches long, with which it &s;ecures its hold in climbing trees by twi&s;ting it round the branches.&mdash;Both the&s;e animals have four &s;trong claws on the fore feet, and five on the hind.</P>
<P>The LESSER ANT-EATER has a &s;harp-pointed no&s;e, inclining a little downward: Its ears are &s;mall, and hid in the fur: It has two &s;trong hooked claws on the fore feet, the outward one being much the large&s;t; and four on the hind feet: Its fur is long, &s;oft, and &s;ilky,&mdash;of a yellowi&s;h-brown colour: Its length, from no&s;e to tail, is &s;even inches and a half; tail above eight, thick at the ba&s;e, and taper to the end.&mdash;It inhabits Guiana, climbs trees in que&s;t of a &s;pecies of ants which build their ne&s;ts among the branches.</P>
<P>Animals of this kind are found in Ceylon and the Cape of Good Hope.&mdash;Kolben de&s;cribes the latter as hav|ing long heads and tongues; that they feed on ants; and are &s;o &s;trong, that, if they fa&s;ten their claws in the ground, they cannot ea&s;ily be pulled away.&mdash;It is cal|led in Ceylon the <HI>Talg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i</HI> or <HI>Ant-Bear.</HI></P>

All the upper parts of its body are clo&s;ely co|vered with &s;cales of different &s;izes, which it can erect at plea&s;ure, oppo&s;ing to its adver&s;ary a formidable row of offen&s;ive weapons, which wound while they re&s;i&s;t, and thus repel the mo&s;t rapacious invader.

the earth, its re&s;i&s;tance is &s;o great, that it will &s;ometimes leave it in the hands of its pur&s;uers: To avoid this, the hunter has recour&s;e to artifice; and, by tickling it with a &s;tick, it gives up its hold, and &s;uffers it&s;elf to be taken alive. If no other means of e&s;cape be left, it rolls it&s;elf up within its covering by drawing in its head and legs, and bringing its tail round them, as a band to connect them more forcibly together: In this &s;ituation it &s;ome|times e&s;capes by rolling it&s;elf over the edge of a preci|pice, and generally falls to the bottom unhurt.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful method of catching Armadillos is by &s;nares laid for them by the &s;ides of rivers and places where they frequent. They all burrow very deep in the ground, and &s;eldom &s;tir out, except during the night, whil&s;t they are in &s;earch of food.</P>
<P>To give a minute de&s;cription of the &s;hells or coverings of the Armadillos would be extremely difficult, as they are all compo&s;ed of a number of parts, differing greatly from each other in the order and di&s;po&s;ition of the fi|gures with which they are di&s;tingui&s;hed: But it may be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that in general there are two large pieces that cover the &s;houlders and the rump, between which lie the bands, which are more or le&s;s in number in different kinds.

<P>Seals are found in great abundance on the coa&s;ts of Great-Britain; particularly in the deep rece&s;&s;es and ca|verns in the northern parts of the i&s;land, where they re|&s;ort in the breeding time, and continue till the young ones are old enough to go to &s;ea.&mdash;The time for taking Seals is in the month of October, or the beginning of November. The hunters, provided with torches and bludgeons, enter the mouths of the caverns about mid|night,
<PB N="450" REF="457">
and row in as far as they can, where they land; and, being properly &s;tationed, begin by making a great noi&s;e, which alarms the Seals, and brings them down from all parts of the cavern in a confu&s;ed body, making frightful &s;hrieks and cries. In this hazardous employ|ment, great care is nece&s;&s;ary on the part of the hunters to avoid the throng, which pre&s;&s;es down with great im|petuo&s;ity, and bears away every thing that oppo&s;es its progre&s;s; but when the fir&s;t crowd is pa&s;t, they kill great numbers of young ones, which generally &s;traggle behind, by &s;triking them on the no&s;e.</P>
<P>A young Seal yields above eight gallons of oil.&mdash;When full grown, their &s;kins are very valuable, and make a beautiful kind of leather, much u&s;ed in making &s;hoes, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The fle&s;h of the Seal is &s;ometimes eaten; and that it was formerly admitted to the tables of the great, may be &s;een in the bill-of-fare of a &s;umptuous entertainment given by Archbi&s;hop Nevil in the reign of Edward the Fourth.</P>
<P>The growth of Seals is &s;o amazingly rapid, that, after nine tides from their birth, they are as active as the old ones.&mdash;The female brings forth her young on the land, &s;its on her hind legs while &s;he &s;uckles them, and as &s;oon as they are able carries them to &s;ea, learns them to &s;wim and &s;earch for food: When they become fatigued, &s;he places them on her back. The young ones know the voice of their mother, and attend to her call.&mdash;The voice of the Seal has been compared to the hoar&s;e barking of a Dog; when young, it is clearer, and re&s;embles the mew|ing of a Cat.</P>
<P>Seals are likewi&s;e found in the Mediterranean and Ca&s;|pian
<PB N="451" REF="458">
&s;eas, in the lake Baikal, and &s;ome of the larger lakes. The&s;e are &s;maller than the &s;alt-water Seals; but &s;o fat, that they &s;eem almo&s;t &s;hapele&s;s.</P>

<P>is much larger than the common Seal, being eight feet in length, and weighing eight hundred pounds.&mdash; The&s;e animals are found among the i&s;lands which lie between Kamt&s;chatka and America; al&s;o on the coa&s;ts of New Zealand, Staten I&s;land, New Georgia, and Falk|land's I&s;lands.&mdash;They lie in thou&s;ands on the &s;hore, in &s;eparate families, each con&s;i&s;ting of above an hundred. One male will &s;ometimes have fifty females, which he guards with extreme jealou&s;y. They are exce&s;&s;ively fat and indolent, &s;ometimes &s;carcely ever moving from the place where they lie, for the &s;pace of three months; during which time the females breed and &s;uckle their
<PB N="452" REF="459">
young. If another approach their &s;tation, they are rou&s;ed from their &s;upinene&s;s: A battle en&s;ues, which fre|quently becomes general, and &s;preads confu&s;ion through the whole &s;hore. The&s;e conflicts are extremely violent, and the wounds they receive very deep, re&s;embling a cut with a &s;abre.</P>
<P>The attachment of the male to the young is very &s;trong: He defends them with great ob&s;tinacy, and fre|quently revenges their lo&s;s upon the female, whom he beats mo&s;t cruelly; whil&s;t &s;he crawls to his feet, and &s;eems to deprecate his wrath with the mo&s;t ob&s;equious g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tures.</P>
<P>The female generally brings forth one, &s;eldom two, at a time.&mdash;They &s;wim with great ea&s;e, at the rate of about &s;even miles in an hour. When wounded, they will &s;eize on a boat, carry it along with them, and &s;ometimes &s;ink it. They can continue a long time under water. In climbing rocks, they fa&s;ten their fore paws, and draw them&s;elves up.</P>
<P>The&s;e, and all the Seal kind, will live a long time after receiving the mo&s;t dreadful wounds; but the mo&s;t trifling blow on the &s;nout or forehead in&s;tantly kills them.</P>
<P>The general colour of the&s;e animals is black. They are covered with a coat of long rough hair, under which is a &s;oft down of a bay colour. On the neck of the old ones, the hair is erect, and a little longer than the re&s;t. &mdash;The fat and fle&s;h of the old males are very nau&s;eous; but tho&s;e of the females and the young, when roa&s;ted, are &s;aid to be as good as the fle&s;h of a &s;ucking pig.</P>

</FIGURE> THE AMERICAN ELK,</HEAD>
<P>OF which we here give a faithful portrait from a living one lately brought from the interior parts of America, &s;eems to be a different animal from that ge|nerally de&s;cribed under the name of the Elk or Moo&s;e-Deer, to which it has very little re&s;emblance. It &s;eems, indeed, to belong to a di&s;tinct &s;pecies; and is probably
<PB N="454" REF="461">
the Elk or Orignal of Canada and the northern parts of America.&mdash;At the age of five years, its length was nine feet from the end of the muzzle to the in&s;ertion of the tail, the head and neck being extended in a line with the body; its height at the &s;houlder four feet &s;ix inches, length of the head one foot &s;ix inches, breadth over the forehead &s;even inches, length of the fore legs two feet five inches, length of the neck two feet &s;ix, its ears nine inches, and tail three. Its horns, which it had ju&s;t &s;hed, are not palmated, like tho&s;e of the Moo&s;e: They are large; and, when full grown, mea&s;ure above &s;ix feet from tip to tip. The antlers are round, and pointed at the ends: The lowermo&s;t antler forms a curve down|ward over each eye, to which it appears a defence. Its hair was long, of a dark dun colour on the back and &s;ides, on the head and legs dark-brown. Its eyes full and lively; and below each there is a deep &s;lit, about two inches in length, the u&s;e of which we are unable to di&s;cover.&mdash;It was a lively, active animal; of great &s;trength of body and limbs. Its hoofs are much &s;maller than tho&s;e of the Rein-Deer, the divi&s;ion between them le&s;s; and, when the animal is in motion, do not make a rattling noi&s;e. It has no mane; but the hair under its neck is longer than that of any other part of the body.</P>
<P>We are told by the owner of this very rare and beau|tiful animal, that it does not attain its full growth till twenty years old, and that it &s;heds its horns every third year.</P>

<HEAD>WILD CATTLE.</HEAD>
<P>WE have been favoured, by Marmaduke Tun&s;tall, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> of Wycliffe, with the following particulars relative to the Wild Cattle of this i&s;land, which, it has been generally &s;uppo&s;ed, were only to be found at Chil|lingham, in the county of Northumberland:&mdash; They are very numerous at Wollaton, in Nottingham&s;hire, the &s;eat of Lord Middleton. The ears and no&s;es of the&s;e are black. When fat, they weigh from &s;ixty to &s;eventy &s;tone. As &s;oon as the calves are dropped, they are al|ways taken away, and put to a tame Cow to be brought up.&mdash;At Gi&s;burne in Craven, York&s;hire, the &s;eat of&mdash; Li&s;ter, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> there are &s;ome perfectly white, except the in&s;ides of their ears, which are brown; without horns, very &s;trong-boned, but not high. They have little or no fat within; but it is finely interlarded with the fle&s;h. They are &s;aid to have been brought originally from Whalley Abbey, in Lanca&s;hire, upon its di&s;&s;olution in the 33d of Henry VIII. Tradition &s;ays, they were drawn to Gi&s;burne by the power of mu&s;ic.&mdash;Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are great numbers of Wild Cattle at Lime-Hall, in Che&s;hire, the &s;eat of &mdash; Leigh, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> They are all white, and have red ears.&mdash;There were formerly great numbers of Wild Cattle at Chartley, in Stafford|&s;hire, the &s;eat of Earl Ferrers; but their numbers are now much reduced, and the breed almo&s;t extinct."</P>
<P>The&s;e are all the accounts we have been able to col|lect
<PB N="456" REF="463">
of this expiring breed, which formerly ranged at large in the wild and exten&s;ive fore&s;ts which over&s;pread this kingdom.</P>
