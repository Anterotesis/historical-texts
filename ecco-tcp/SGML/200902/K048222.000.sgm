<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I con&s;ider the in&s;ignificancy of this trifle, I am &s;urpri&s;ed at my own teme|rity: my rea&s;on would have recoiled, and left nothing but my pre&s;umption to attend it to your Royal feet, had not your graci|ous conde&s;cen&s;ion, in permitting it to ap|proach You, encouraged me in the laudable attempt to celebrate (though by humble means) an aera, au&s;picious, great, and glori|ous.

&s;aw, and &s;elf-approving, &s;miled upon her work; and Victory, when determined to be&s;tow her riche&s;t wreaths of laurel upon Briti&s;h valour, to perpetuate her bounty, wi&s;ely cho&s;e that point of time which &s;he fore&s;aw mu&s;t be the darling theme of fu|ture ages, the period that gave birth to the PRINCE of WALES. Then it was that &s;he crowned Monckton and Rodney with &s;ucce&s;s; and, by the capture of <HI>Marti|nico,</HI> &s;ecured the conque&s;t of Grenada, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and a &s;upreme power over the trade and navigation of the &s;eas, and that immea&s;urable chain of i&s;lands which extend from the Ea&s;tern point of Hi&s;paniola, almo&s;t to the Continent of South America, With this view did &s;he command Albemarle, the Pupil of her fa|vourite Cumberland, and Pocock, who had before triumphed in the Ea&s;t, now to ex|tend our conque&s;ts over the We&s;tern world. The Havannah, from its &s;ituation, a place of the fir&s;t importance to our enemies, the grand rendezvous of the galleons, thought

<P>Among&s;t the brilliant tran&s;actions of a year which makes a golden page in the En|gli&s;h annals, we &s;ee Granby Victorious on the banks of the We&s;er; and our gracious Monarch, on the au&s;picious morning, when his beloved and amiable Con&s;ort gives an Heir to Britain, beholds the trea&s;ures of Spain pa&s;s before his Palace walls. So many illu&s;trious, circum&s;tances attending your Royal Highne&s;s's dawn of life, pro|mi&s;ed a zenith of glory; and the &s;hining qualities of your youth ju&s;tify our hopes, and give an ample &s;atisfaction to our ex|pectations.

<P>Well, Sir, Fortune has arrang'd each circum&s;tance of your adventure here to the full extent of your wi&s;hes. Chance throws into your hands a Lady's picture; the features are, ju&s;t what your fancy imagines to be the mo&s;t beauti|ful

in the world; and for &s;even or eight days, by your orders, I &s;earch'd the Court, the city, the country, for the charming original: my en|deavours proved fruitle&s;s, and you begin to de|&s;pair of ever finding this lovely incognita; when one day, in hunting, led by the ardour of the chace, having &s;tray'd from your &s;uite, you find your&s;elf near the park walls of this ca&s;tle&mdash; hear the cry of di&s;tre&s;s, &s;ee women pur&s;ued by a huge and fierce boar. Fired with a gene|rous alarm at their danger, you fly to their a&s;|&s;i&s;tance; to kill this mon&s;ter, was but the work of a minute; but what a minute of delight, of tran&s;port! A young Lady from wearine&s;s and fright having fallen at the foot of a tree, pre|&s;ents to your eyes the very identical lovely ori|ginal of the picture. Thus, in &s;aving <HI>her</HI> life, your fir&s;t interview was the mo&s;t au&s;picious mo|ment of your's.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own, my dear Frederick, hitherto I have rea&s;on to be content; as yet, 'tis certain, my quality is a &s;ecret to Don Leopold and his.daughter; and as I was fir&s;t introduced to them. by your name, they &s;till imagine me to be Don Frederick. The amiable Seraphina li&s;tens to my vows with the mo&s;t flattering complacency, approves my pa&s;&s;ion, an&s;wer's each gentle &s;igh, each tender look, with the &s;weet &s;ympathy of

<P>Which he readily granted, not know|ing you to be the Prince of Arragon.</P>

<P>Ah! Frederick, this day may be mo&s;t unhappy! Seraphina loves me, but before I wed her I am re&s;olved to put her affection to the proof; if it cannot bear the trial, oh, Frede|rick! what a &s;evere &s;troke to a heart &s;o ten|der, &s;o &s;en&s;ible, &s;o pa&s;&s;ionate as mine!</P>

<P>None of your buts! you are going to be my Son-in-law; take it once for all, I was never made for a courtier; I am a fanta&s;tical, ridiculous old fellow, that thinks noble birth wants no decoration of title; that a &s;tar upon a brea&s;t cannot give honor to a heart that's ba&s;e, nor a ribbon dignity to a neck that per|haps de&s;erves a halter. Tho' I live at a great expence, I keep within my income; I have not u&s;e for more than half the &s;ervants I main|tain, but then the other half I con&s;ider have u&s;e

<SPEAKER>Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would indeed be an extraordi|nary character at court.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, Don Frederick, but I prefer being lodged in this old ca&s;tle of mine here, to the honor of being inconveniently &s;ituated near a Prince; in one word, I'd rather walk about my park, gardens, and my own improvements, than to &s;lide and amble through an antichamber, like a cypher of great importance, in a groupe of idle bu&s;y-bodies, female profligates, reverend athei&s;ts, mock patriots, and right honourable &s;harpers, the whole forming a villainous picture, a curious court calendar.</P>

<P>Then don't attempt; a&s;k a lover to re&s;ign his mi&s;tre&s;s, a lady to prai&s;e her rival, a lawyer to tell truth, and a Doctor to return his fee; but never a&s;k me to go to court; you &s;hall not change my mode of thinking, nor &s;hall I try to alter your's.</P>

No &s;uch thing, I tell you; and yet, you men exclaim, the perfidious woman! the fal&s;e fair one! the cruel creature! Now that's &s;o unrea|&s;onable, ab&s;urd, and ridiculous! ha, ha, ha!</P>
