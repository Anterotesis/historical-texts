<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of the following Scenes, fully &s;en|&s;ible how much he owes to the talents of the <HI>Actor,</HI> the <HI>Mu&s;ician,</HI> and the <HI>Painter,</HI> can derive no con|fidence from the &s;ucce&s;s of the repre&s;entation, when he delivers them over to the judgement of the clo&s;et: But deficient as he may be in the execution of this e&s;&s;ay, he cannot &s;ubmit to be thought ignorant in the principles of Dramatic Writing; and would willingly premi&s;e the origin and progre&s;s of his de&s;ign, as an explanation, if not a ju&s;tification, of &s;ome of its imperfections.</P>
<P>Every one may remember how much the F&ecirc;te Champ&eacute;tre, given by a noble Lord la&s;t &s;ummer, en|gaged the public curio&s;ity: It was thought, that to pre&s;erve for a more general di&s;play, an entertainment of &s;o &s;ingular and elegant a kind, would be not only plea&s;ing to the public, but &s;erviceable to the polite arts. Accordingly, permi&s;&s;ion having been obtained to employ the mu&s;ic, and to copy &s;ome of the deco|rations, a plan was projected for adapting them to the Stage.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">
The Fable, by the means of which they were to be introduced, being only the &s;econdary object, and the intention <HI>then</HI> to confine the repre&s;entation to two acts, a plot of the utmo&s;t &s;implicity was judged the mo&s;t proper; and in that deci&s;ion the Author re&s;ts upon the example of Moliere, and many of the be&s;t criticks, of, perhaps, the be&s;t age in Theatrical Hi&s;tory; who, in pieces of this nature, though they introduced charac|ters of comedy, purpo&s;ely avoided, in &s;everal in&s;tances, tho&s;e intricacies and combinations of incidents, which generally, but perhaps fal&s;ly, are &s;uppo&s;ed e&s;&s;ential to a regular Drama.</P>
<P>It is not the bu&s;ine&s;s of this preface to draw a parallel between the Engli&s;h and French Stages, but it may not be out of place, ju&s;t to touch the characters of each, provided it be permitted to lay Shake&s;pear out of the que&s;tion: He &s;tands &s;ingle and inimitable; his excellencies cannot be weighed, becau&s;e it is im|po&s;&s;ible to counter-ballance the &s;cale. Without ap|peal therefore to his almo&s;t &s;upernatural powers, we may pronounce the properties of our Stage, whether con&s;idered in Tragedy or Comedy, to con&s;i&s;t in energy, &s;pirit, &s;ublimity, force of character, and of ex|pre&s;&s;ion&mdash;like the Hercules of Farne&s;e, all is mu&s;cle and nerve&mdash;with equal truth it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that a few examples excepted, and tho&s;e not much in the cour&s;e of acting at pre&s;ent, we mu&s;t turn to France to find the graces of the Apollo&mdash;art, regularity, elegance, delicacy, touches of &s;entiment, adapted only to the
<PB REF="4">
mo&s;t poli&s;hed manners, di&s;tingui&s;h their Theatres. In literary warfare, we call their compo&s;itions in&s;ipid; they de&s;cribe ours as barbarous&mdash;both are unju&s;t&mdash;all will agree, that to blend &s;trength and refinement would be to attain perfection.</P>
<P>No candid reader will &s;uppo&s;e the Author of this piece means to infer, that he has in any degree accom|pli&s;hed this union, in the part which has fallen to his &s;hare; but, he will be bold to &s;ay, it is the only part which has been wanting to complete a &s;pecies of entertainment new to this country; elegant in its principle, and innocent, if not beneficial, in its ten|dency. He will be amply rewarded, even in the failure of his &s;pecimen, if it excites others, who may be better qualified, to pur&s;ue the &s;ame ideas.</P>
<P>They who &s;uppo&s;e an Engli&s;h audience, becau&s;e u&s;ed to plain entertainment, are incapable of reli&s;h|ing the mo&s;t refined, are greatly mi&s;taken. It is true, there will ever be &s;pectators in the two extremes of the hou&s;e, who are ta&s;tele&s;s and de&s;picable&mdash;to the honour of the town be it &s;aid, they are but few&mdash;and whether they bawl for a hornpipe from the Upper Gallery, or yawn in the wearine&s;s of di&s;&s;ipa|pation in the Boxes, they equally betray &s;tupidity, prejudice, or caprice: But the middle cla&s;s and bulk of the a&s;&s;embly, like that of the kingdom at large, will ever be on the &s;ide of nature, truth, and &s;en&s;e. Let the piece be founded upon tho&s;e principles,
<PB REF="5">
and applau&s;e will follow every circum&s;tance of elegance and decoration that can accompany them.</P>
<P>A &s;incere zeal for the improvement of the &s;tage, has prompted this digre&s;&s;ion. It is requi&s;ite now to return, for a moment, to the hi&s;tory of the un|dertaking.</P>
<P>Mr. Garrick, after peru&s;ing the outlines of the two original acts, thought he di&s;covered in the writer &s;ome talents for the higher &s;pecies of comedy, and encouraged him to extend his plan. The &s;cenery al&s;o, which in the fir&s;t &s;ketches promi&s;ed a brilliant effect; the compo&s;ition of the mu&s;ic, and the names of the dancers who were engaged, all &s;eemed to require more di&s;tinction than could be given to them in an after|piece. But the mo&s;t prevalent incentive to the Au|thor, was the promi&s;e of Mr. Garrick's a&s;&s;i&s;tance; his judgement pervaded the whole, and though it may dimini&s;h the poet, it is the pride of the friend, to make a public acknowledgement to that gentle|man, in the words of Horace to Melpomene,

<P>Who, in the name of curio&s;ity, is &s;he that bears this romantic title? for your letter was a mere eclogue; the devil a thing could I make out, but a rhap&s;ody upon rural innocence, and an in|vitation from a gentleman I did not know, to an entertainment I never &s;aw&mdash;What, are we to have a repre&s;entation of the Pa&s;tor-fido in a Garden?</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>An orphan ward of the worthy old gentleman, at who&s;e &s;eat you now are: His character is &s;in|gular, and as amiable in its way as her's. Inhe|riting a great e&s;tate, and liberally educated, his

di&s;po&s;ition led him early to a country life, where his benevolence and ho&s;pitality are boundle&s;s; and the&s;e qualities, joined with an imagination bor|dering upon the whim&s;ical, have given a peculiar turn to the manners of the neighbourhood, that, in my opinion, degrades the poli&s;h of courts&mdash;but judge of the original.</P>

<P>Sir, by what I already &s;ee of Oldworth's Oaks, and know of the character of the ma&s;ter, I am per&s;uaded the talent mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for the com|pany will be that of giving due prai&s;e.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is not a fellow in England has a more &s;u&s;ceptible heart: You may have learnt in your foreign tour to di&s;gui&s;e it, but if you have lo&s;t it, put all your acqui&s;itions together, and the ballance will be again&s;t you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DUPELEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have learned at lea&s;t, not to have it impo&s;ed upon: Shew me but a woman from an Italian
<PB N="7" REF="17">
Prince&s;s, to a figurante at the French opera; or change the &s;cene, and carry me to the rural nymphs from a vintage in Burgundy, to a dance round a may-pole at Old&s;worth's Oaks&mdash;and at the fir&s;t glance I will di&s;cover the whole extent of their artifice, find their true lure, and bring them to my hand as ea&s;ily as a tame &s;parrow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, my &s;agacious friend, upon what cir|cum&s;tances have you formed your &s;u&s;picions that <HI>I</HI> am more likely to be impos'd upon than your|&s;elf?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DUPELEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon every one I have &s;een and heard; but above all upon that natural propen&s;ity of every true home|bred Engli&s;hman, to think one woman different from another&mdash;Now I hold there is but one woman in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I perfectly agree, and Maria is that charming one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DUPELEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but Maria, and Lady Bab, and Pamela Andrews, and Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe, and the girl that &s;teals a heart in a country church, or &s;he that picks your pocket in Covent-Garden, are one and the &s;ame creature for all that&mdash;I am always too quick for them, and make fools of them fir&s;t&mdash;Oh do but try them by the principle I have laid down; you'll find them as tran&s;parent as gla&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>My own principle will an&s;wer my purpo&s;e ju&s;t as well; with that per&s;pective I have looked through

the woman, and di&s;covered the angel; and you will do the &s;ame when you &s;ee her, or never brag of your eye-&s;ight more.</P>

<P>Oh, he can never di&s;approve a pa&s;&s;ion that &s;oars above the &s;tars!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has all the prejudices of his years, and wordly knowledge; the common old Gentleman's character&mdash;You may &s;ee it in every drama from the days of Terence, to tho&s;e of Congreve; though not perhaps with quite &s;o much good humour, and &s;o little ob&s;tinacy as my Uncle &s;hews. He is ever mo&s;t impetuous, when mo&s;t kind; and I dare tru&s;t his re&s;entment will end with a dramatic forgivene&s;s. Should it not, I may have pride in the &s;acrifice of his e&s;tate, but no regret.&mdash;So much for fortune, Charles&mdash;are there any other means to reconcile me to your approbation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DUPELEY.</SPEAKER>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Charles, I have li&s;tened to your raillery with

more patience than it de&s;erves, and &s;hould at la&s;t be out of humour with &s;uch an importation of con|ceit and affectation, if I was not &s;ure your good &s;en&s;e would &s;oon get the better of it. This is called knowing the world&mdash;to form notions without, per|haps, ever &s;eeing a man in his natural character, or conver&s;ing with a woman of principle: and then, for fear of being impo&s;ed upon, be really dup'd out of the mo&s;t valuable feelings in human nature, confidence in friend&s;hip, and e&s;teem in love.</P>
