<HEAD>PREFACE</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY <HI>Margelina Scribelinda Macularia.</HI></BYLINE>
<P>AS there are &s;o many Impo&s;tors and Imitators Abroad, it is highly requi&s;ite the Public &s;hould be &s;atisfied, that this is the true and genuine <HI>Dunciad</HI> of Mrs. <HI>Mary Midnight;</HI> to which End I have wrote this &s;hort Preface. The Reader, there|fore, is de&s;ir'd to attend to me with a little Patience, before he en|ters upon this great and wonderful Work. The exten&s;ive Fame our Author has gain'd, by her <HI>learned Lucubrations,</HI> in all the <HI>Courts</HI> and <HI>Univer&s;ities</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI> has excited many (who have, by &s;ome Means or other, met with &s;ome of her Fragments) to vend among them their Heaps of Tra&s;h in her Name; but it is hop'd the World will do her the Ju&s;tice, to think &s;he is not the Author of &s;uch poor paul|try, wi&s;hy, wa&s;hy, &s;him-&s;ham Performances.</P>
<P>To reward, among many others, the Authors of &s;uch Proceed|ings in a Manner due to their De&s;erts, Mrs. <HI>Midnight</HI> has de&s;ign'd and executed this Work; but, as an Affair of &s;o much Con&s;equence could not but get Air in the World, &s;everal of the&s;e, who were con&s;|cious of their Guilt, applied to her to <HI>be excus'd a Place;</HI> or, in other Words, <HI>to be left out</HI> of her <HI>Dunciad:</HI> Among which came the celebrated <HI>Pentweazle,</HI> and meanly offer'd her <HI>five Guineas</HI> in part, on Sub&s;cription to her Mi&s;cellany of Poems, to be publi&s;h'd &s;ome Time in <HI>February</HI> next. But Mrs. <HI>Midnight</HI> being above any mercenary View, was deaf to all Overtures, however con&s;iderable, of this kind: Upon which, with their u&s;ual A&s;&s;urance, her Enemies ad|vertis'd even this intended Work, <HI>the Old Woman's Dunciad,</HI> in her's and in my Name, intending to impo&s;e &s;ome Trumpery or other on the World, before this Poem could appear; and, with the mo&s;t con&s;ummate Impudence, put out Adverti&s;ements again&s;t the fictitious
<PB REF="3">
Imitators of Mrs. <HI>Midnight's</HI> Works, to out-face, if po&s;&s;ible, the very Truth it&s;elf. But we have, thro' a &s;urpri&s;ing Quickne&s;s of Ge|nius, peculiar to our Author, anticipated their De&s;igns, to their utter Confu&s;ion: Since the World will, by reading the following Work, be convinc'd of the genuine and elevated Spirit of Mrs. <HI>Midnight,</HI> and will not, for the future, be &s;o ea&s;ily impos'd on. I &s;hall ju&s;t add a Word or two on our Author's Character in general, and on this Work in particular. As to Mrs. <HI>Midnight's</HI> Reputation as an Au|thor, notwith&s;tanding &s;he has made her&s;elf known but lately under that Name, yet it has been very exten&s;ive, under the more general one of <HI>Old Woman;</HI> &s;he having had the principal Hand in mo&s;t of the Performances that have been wrote within the&s;e few Years pa&s;t; all which have been infallibly known by the Critics, who upon Peru||&s;al of them, have immediately laid them down, and crying out, <HI>the Author's</HI> an <HI>Old Woman;</HI> intimating thereby their Knowledge of her Works, and her e&s;tabli&s;h'd Reputation that rais'd them above Criti|ci&s;m. As to this Poem in particular, the Publick can never enough acknowledge the Obligations they owe her, in the&s;e Improvements of our Language; which, however, fall va&s;tly &s;hort of what &s;he pur|po&s;es to do, having &s;elected &s;everal thou&s;ands of the mo&s;t curious and copious in the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Eulogium on the <HI>Welch</HI> Tongue. <HI>Cambria</HI> Book II.
