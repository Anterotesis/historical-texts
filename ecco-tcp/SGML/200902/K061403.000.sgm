<L>At &s;uch a time, &s;uperfluous &s;eems the art,</L>

<L>The &s;orrowing MUSES need them&s;elves relief,</L>

<SPEAKER>Joll.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ecod, wife, I believe &s;o. As I come up &s;treet cou'dn't tell what was the matter with me; met hone&s;t Dick the cobler&mdash;came out with his "good morrow, Ma&s;ter Jollyboy." I felt a &s;ort of a&mdash;thought he might as well have &s;aid nothing. Tom the farrier gave me a friendly &s;mack o' th' &s;houlder; I had a mind to knock him down
<PB N="2" REF="5">for his joke: then, now, coming into my own hou&s;e, forgot to &s;toop, and bump'd my forehead again&s;t the top o' the door-ca&s;e. Oh, ho! then it's the ca&s;h has done all this! I wi&s;h 'twas gone, for while I have it I feel I &s;hall be as impudent as the devil.</P>

<SPEAKER>Joll.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dr. Grig&s;by! I wou'dn't let him cure my cat of a tooth-ach. The fellow has made money out of peo|ple's folly, and now don't know how to behave him&s;elf.</P>

<P>La, Ma'am, I didn't expect you for that!</P>

<SPEAKER>Loui&s;a.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe it. From certain family circum|&s;tances, immaterial to any but my&s;elf, I have been obliged to&mdash;however, you know I came from Ireland&mdash;have been in France, and&mdash;I am unfortunately not on the be&s;t terms with my friends, till a make up can be brought about to my wi&s;h. Not being over &s;trong in pur&s;e, I plann'd a frugal retirement; the variety of calls upon the feelings of my heart have at length exhau&s;ted my little finance; therefore&mdash; but mind, I'm not ca&s;t down&mdash;no, I'm as happy&mdash;</P>

<P>Dear, I'm &s;o &s;orry&mdash;</P>

<P>I affront you!</P>

<P>Lord! I never was more gay or cheerful in my whole life: but I'll tell you&mdash;You know, you and your hu&s;band are very hone&s;t people, and get nothing but what you hardly earn; now, why &s;hould I from my extravagance become a burden to you?</P>
</SP>

<P>Come, perhaps I mayn't leave your village. But yet, better &s;ome &s;trange place&mdash;tho' who here knows me&mdash; <STAGE>(a&s;ide.)</STAGE> Margery, I've conceiv'd a thought to &s;tay among you without inconvenience to any one; I think I cou'd be u&s;eful to your Mi&s;tre&s;s Allbut, here. From her character of a pa&s;&s;ion for literary amu&s;ements, &s;he might, perhaps, afford me a &s;ituation to read, or tran&s;late French; tran&s;cribe her poetry, for I am told &s;he has wrote a number of pretty things; or cou'd, upon occa&s;ion, dre&s;s up a cap for her&mdash;eh, Margery, cou'd you recommend me? You know you told me &s;he &s;ometimes reads her poems to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Eh&mdash;Well, I'll call on her, my lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loui&s;a.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, none of your lady's to me&mdash;I mu&s;t &s;oon unlady my&s;elf. Upon my honour I &s;hall be exceeding angry if you are not even merry. There now, that's a dear good woman, <STAGE>(&s;hakes hands cordially, and goes to a che&s;t of drawers.)</STAGE></P>

<P>Yes, Ma'am, the compliment I put in that mix|ture was two grains, or, as we of the faculty write in our Latin pro&s;criptions, dux graniorum, &s;ix &s;cruples, or cater|&s;crupolibus; and, Madam, I'll venture to a&s;&s;irm, that the whole material medicar does not furni&s;h a cure of more efficacious effica&s;ey, that is, when we talk of a ca&s;e, razor|ca&s;e&mdash;hem! I mean the &s;oul-ca&s;e; the body being the ca&s;e of the &s;oul, as a bottle is of a bottle of old port; the wine being the &s;pirit; and &s;o we doctors wax the cork to pre|vent evaporation or &s;omentation; ju&s;t as if a gentleman, to &s;have his chin, would lather his occiput; that is, what we of the faculty call the whole healing art&mdash;&s;cammony, wild poppy, the &s;ublimate of &s;typtic water, anthelmintic wine, hicra picra, and the nervous &s;y&s;tem.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my Love, he's no more a brother. His late acqui&s;ition of a baronet's title, which he never expected, has rais'd him &s;o much above me, that I'm now out of &s;ight&mdash;every &s;park of fraternal affection; even compa&s;&s;ion for my &s;ufferings has been long extingui&s;hed!</P>

<P>Aye, Madam, on the &s;udden death of your wor|thy hu&s;band, what a pity that you cou'dn't &s;uppre&s;s your own ideas of rank and birth, by being above all concern for the bus'ne&s;s, in tru&s;ting it into the hands of this de&s;igning fool&mdash; this knavi&s;h Mr. Allbut!</P>

Ay, we may &s;ee the world in our village! But a fig for the world&mdash;Let indu&s;try &s;ecure independence; and if wealth or poverty will come, let the rich man be proud only of his power to be the poor man's friend.</P>
