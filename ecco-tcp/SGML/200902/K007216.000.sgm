<P>O! damn it, no; it would not do for me at all. Service with a &s;ingle gentleman, well and good; but married families are hell and the devil.</P>

<SPEAKER>Laz.</SPEAKER>
<P>To tell you the truth, I am afraid to &s;tay with Don <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> left, as valets are apt to ape their ma&s;ters, I &s;hould be tempted to imitate him; and, as he had married your mi&s;tre&s;s, the devil might put it into my head to marry you.</P>

<P>I have been at the Duke of <HI>Medina's;</HI> and I find his wounds are not &s;o bad as I at fir&s;t ap|prehended. The report, however, of Don <HI>Pedro</HI> being the per&s;on who a&s;&s;aulted him, rather gains ground.</P>

<P>I &s;ay then, Sir, I never did; for the thing was fir&s;t mentioned to me: and, isn't it common enough, when a genteel likely girl lives in the hou&s;e with a gentleman, for people to talk?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I &s;han't di&s;pute the matter with you, now. Go, take the coach, and fetch your young lady home, &s;he's at her aunt's. Why don't you go where I bid you?</P>
