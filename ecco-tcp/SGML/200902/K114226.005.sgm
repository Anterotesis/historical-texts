<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Hi&s;tory of Benignus is, in the&s;e volumes, brought to &s;uch a period as &s;ufficiently enforces the <HI>moral</HI> intended to be deduced from it. The laws of romance, novel, and comedy, might require a dif|ferent cata&s;trophe: for in tho&s;e, it is too often the cu&s;tom, (at <HI>all events,</HI> even though many are brought in, as it were, by <HI>the head and &s;houlders</HI>) to croud the <HI>la&s;t</HI> &s;cene with per&s;ons married, or murdered, to the novel|reader's &s;atisfaction. But the laws of <HI>nar|rative</HI>
<PB N="vi" REF="5">ought to be le&s;s rigid, and, I flatter my&s;elf, the reader will forgive my adhering, upon this occa&s;ion, to <HI>human nature,</HI> even though I verge again&s;t the formalities of li|terary cu&s;tom.&mdash;</P>
<P>The former portions of the work con|tain many of tho&s;e dialogues, conver&s;ation|pieces, and characters, which fell, nece&s;&s;arily, in the way of our emigrating author in his romantic ramble after <HI>happine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>But now, as he advances farther into &s;ocie|ty, a greater variety of <HI>events</HI> and <HI>opinions,</HI> (&s;ome &s;erious, &s;ome whim&s;ical, according to the particular temper, mind, and manner of the &s;peaker) pre&s;ent them&s;elves: to which have been generally added, the adventurer's re|flections, upon peculiar &s;cenes, as they fi|gured before him.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="6">In the progre&s;s of the&s;e delineations, the great DESIGN of the Work, hath never been lo&s;t &s;ight of: on the contrary, every volume, as it may be noted by the di&s;cerning reader, carries the intended illu&s;tration nearer to the heart and under&s;tanding; till the re&s;ult of the <HI>whole,</HI> it is hoped, appears to be in full lu&s;tre, <HI>what</HI> the author him&s;elf, feelingly a&s;&s;erts, it <HI>&s;hould</HI> be.</P>
<P>"Unhappy (&s;ays our di&s;appointed adven|turer, in the 110th chapter of the volumes now offered) is he, who, in the days of his youth, traver&s;es this intricate world, without a guide; and of all other prepo&s;ter|ous pa&s;&s;ions, the mo&s;t prepo&s;terous is <HI>that,</HI> which induces an orphan of fortune to tru&s;t him&s;elf to mankind, with neither experience to direct, prudence to advi&s;e, nor oeconomy
<PB N="viii" REF="7">to regulate. Let no man who is new to the active &s;cenes of a city, ever venture again into a metropolis, unattended: let no man indulge his inclinations for <HI>travelling,</HI> with|out fir&s;t con&s;idering that if he is mi&s;erable at home, he mu&s;t tread warily indeed, if he does not <HI>increa&s;e</HI> that mi&s;ery abroad. Let no man ru&s;h into the tumults of life without a virtuous monitor: in a word, let every <HI>Telemachus</HI> tremble at the conduct, which is not fir&s;t &s;anctified by the approbation of a <HI>Mentor!"</HI></P>
<P>This apo&s;trophe hath been <HI>variou&s;ly</HI> exem|plified in the cour&s;e of the Hi&s;tory; in which, it appears to have been, not the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> effort of the author, to analize the real characters of men, to di&s;play the &s;trange and ridiculous incon&s;i&s;tences of human opi|nion
<PB N="ix" REF="8">re&s;pecting HAPPINESS; and, (after all this &s;hew off of folly, delu&s;ion, and ab&s;ur|dity, under their characteri&s;tic di&s;gui&s;es) to fix, by predominant arguments, the <HI>highe&s;t</HI> degree of that happine&s;s, in the practice of Virtue, and in the precepts of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>Both the editor and the author have, al|ready, entered a caveat again&s;t being ac|countable for the vice or depravity of any of the <HI>characters.</HI> Who ever thought of charging Shake&s;peare with immorality, for having drawn an Jago; Fielding, a Blifil; or Richard&s;on, a Lovelace?</P>
<P>It is certain that, in the&s;e clo&s;ing vo|lumes, &s;ome reprehen&s;ible characters, will offer them&s;elves; and, perhaps, &s;ome &s;cenes that certain editors might have rejected. But, I am per&s;uaded, tho&s;e writers, who only em|ploy
<PB N="x" REF="9">them&s;elves in drawing pictures of Vir|tue, do her but <HI>half</HI> ju&s;tice. The real gem is &s;et off by the foil; the charms of beauty are heighened by deformity: in like manner the lu&s;tre of <HI>virtue</HI> derives greater brilliancy from being oppo&s;ed to the &s;quallid appear|ances of <HI>vice.</HI> If the maxim of the poet be indeed true: if,
<Q><L>Vice is a mon&s;ter of &s;o frightful mein</L>
<L>As, to be hated, needs but to be <HI>&s;een:</HI></L></Q>
it follows, that to <HI>pourtray</HI> that mon&s;ter, and to place the portrait, (by way of <HI>contra&s;t</HI>) near the picture of Virtue, is the mo&s;t com|mendable ta&s;k in which a moral painter, either &s;erious or comic, can engage.</P>
<P>Aye, (it may be &s;aid) but if this mon&s;ter is &s;o di&s;gui&s;ed by fal&s;e colouring, and &s;o tricked
<PB N="xi" REF="10">out by the hand of the painter, as to attract us under the form of a cherub, and is thereby able to "make the wor&s;e, appear the better rea&s;on," may not the danger be exce&s;&s;ive? To this I an&s;wer, that in the world,&mdash;in <HI>real</HI> life&mdash;infinite are the dangers produced by this poli&s;hed, and Belial-like hypocri&s;y: but, it has been the con&s;tant care of this Hi&s;tory, to make every contra&s;t <HI>con&s;picuous:</HI> thus the irregular bounty of BENIGNUS is op|po&s;ed to the rational &s;ympathy of <HI>Greaves:</HI> the coar&s;ene&s;s of the <HI>Grocer,</HI> is held in con|tra&s;t to the delicacy of <HI>Blewett:</HI> the openne&s;s of <HI>Benjamin,</HI> to the artifice of his uncle: the poli&s;h of <HI>Draper,</HI> to the queerne&s;s of <HI>Green:</HI> the purity of conjugal love, in <HI>Sud|berry,</HI> to the illicit engagements of <HI>Benignus,</HI> with <HI>Lucy</HI> and <HI>Blake</HI>'s wife; the &s;y&s;tem of
<PB N="xii" REF="11">the Freethinker, with the &s;y&s;tem of the Lady who &s;peaks in the FRAGMENT that will be found in the pre&s;ent volumes.</P>
<P>Thus, even the <HI>carele&s;s</HI> reader, may detect the cloven foot, as he goes along; and di&s;|tingui&s;h the painted devil, which, (arrayed only in the ornaments of native innocence) in de&s;pite of tho&s;e plau&s;ible affectations that are a&s;&s;umed to make him pro&s;per in &s;ociety, come to merited &s;hame at la&s;t.</P>
<P>Here then the editor thinks it nece&s;&s;ary to terminate the Hi&s;tory, and to take leave both of his author and the public.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY of BENIGNUS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="95" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XCV.</HEAD>
<P>AS I was impre&s;&s;ing my &s;eal upon the wax of Mr. Blewitt's letter, a &s;ervant informed me that the taylor was waiting for me below; who, upon being u&s;hered into the &s;tudy, &s;aid he attended my plea&s;ure, by reque&s;t of Mr. Ben. Abrahams, and &s;hould think
<PB N="2" REF="17">him&s;elf honoured by my commands. Yes, &s;ir, &s;aid I, you will make me up a &s;uit of genteel half-mourning, and as expeditiou&s;ly as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Upon this, he took out his in&s;tru|ments of men&s;uration, and began to make &s;ome &s;mall objections to certain particulars in the workman&s;hip and ta&s;te of my pre&s;ent habiliments; ob|&s;erving, with an acute eye of critici&s;m, while he was notching and nipping the parchment, that, he &s;aw the fellow who cut out my cloaths, <HI>would</HI> have disfigured me, if he could: So cobbled a job, &s;ir, cries he, I never yet &s;aw. What do you chiefly di&s;like in the thing, replied I? Oh, &s;ir, an&s;wers the taylor, it is very impertinent in me to di&s;like any thing a gentleman plea&s;es to wear; and moreover, it
<PB N="3" REF="18">looks like <HI>di&s;paraging</HI> another man's labour: but as to the&s;e cloaths, &s;ir, the Skip, begging your pardon, ought to be run through the eyes with his own needle: tho' indeed one would think he had lo&s;t his eye-&s;ight long ago, for look, &s;ir, the &s;leeves are too little, the &s;kirts too &s;hort, the flaps too long, the che&s;t too narrow, and the collar too broad: then, &s;ir, what a <HI>&s;kimping</HI> wai&s;tcoat is here! neither cut, nor turn, nor &s;lope, nor figure: Oh the wretch! And as to the breeches, why they are mere <HI>hop&s;acks.</HI> I do not mean to prejudice you, &s;ir, again&s;t the man, becau&s;e, no doubt, he has done his be&s;t; I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that <HI>I</HI> will do mine.</P>
<P>Here he dropt upon one knee, and took the dimen&s;ions of my wai&s;t
<PB N="4" REF="19">and knees. It &s;eems too, that the <HI>former</HI> work, was not only badly cut out, but wor&s;e put together; for this connoi&s;&s;eur pre&s;ently found out, that the buttons were not equidi&s;tant, the &s;eams were inelegantly fini&s;hed, the plaits were uneven, and the button|holes were <HI>boggled.</HI></P>
<P>Now from the&s;e analytical premi&s;es I drew two po&s;itive inferences; fir&s;t, that I had hitherto employed the wor&s;t, and wickede&s;t taylor that ever threaded a needle; and that I was now going to employ one of the mo&s;t hone&s;t and ingenious of his trade. <HI>This,</HI> indeed, he &s;oon thought proper to confirm with his own mouth, by a&s;&s;uring me, that I &s;hould <HI>now</HI> have a &s;uit fit for a chri&s;tian; that it &s;hould grow to me as <HI>natural</HI> as if I was born
<PB N="5" REF="20">with it; that he had the honour to work for &s;ome of the fir&s;t people in the kingdom, and among&s;t others, for &s;ome of the <HI>blood royal.</HI></P>
<P>At this aweful intelligence he pur&s;ed up his mouth, &s;troaked his chin, and made a pau&s;e; appearing perfectly to under&s;tand the importance of taking leave at the critical time; to &s;tay a moment beyond which, is often to <HI>out&s;tay</HI> the moment of <HI>eclat</HI> and dignity. Having fini&s;hed therefore his climax, clo&s;ing it full upon the &s;acred per&s;ons, yea, upon the very backs of the Blood Royal, he made his bow and <HI>exit</HI> in the &s;ame judicious in&s;tant.</P>
<P>He had &s;carce &s;hut the door, before I ca&s;t my eye upon the lacerated but|ton-hole, which I fully intended he
<PB N="6" REF="21">&s;hould in &s;ome mea&s;ure repair upon the &s;pot; yet &s;uch a &s;tickler was I, at that moment, for the pre&s;ervation of dignity, that I determined to vi&s;it my friend, with a rent in my garment, rather than lower the man's con|&s;equence, by calling him back to the ignominy of threading a needle: and &s;o off walked the taylor, without the lea&s;t diminution of his character or con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>By this time the well-bred bell of Mr. Draper began to tingle, and I took the liberty of a friend to run up to his chamber, and amu&s;e him with the adventure. I wi&s;h, &s;aid he, Benignus, you could wave your ap|pointment with that money-telling fellow, your agent, till to-morrow. Do, my dear Lad, &s;end an apology to
<PB N="7" REF="22">Par&s;ons, &s;ay you will meet <HI>him</HI> to|morrow, and dedicate the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> time to mirth, and to me.</P>
<P>Such was the grace with which this young gentleman always &s;poke, when he wi&s;hed to per&s;uade, and <HI>by</HI> per&s;ua&s;ion to gain his purpo&s;e; the &s;mile upon his cheek looked &s;uch affability, and his air was &s;o attracting, that, whether he invited to plea&s;ure, or to bu&s;ine&s;s, he was &s;ure to conquer. I agreed to attend him, and went down again into the library to &s;cribble an apology to the agent; for which indi&s;cretion I once more beg pardon of the mercantile reader, who, in &s;pite of all I can &s;ay however, hath a&s;&s;uredly given me up, as a thought|le&s;s young fellow, who would never come to any thing.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="23">The tru&s;ty Benjamin now came loaded with my portmanteau, which he had laid over his own &s;houlder; &s;o that I was enabled to dre&s;s my&s;elf with more neatne&s;s. Well, Benjamin, &s;aid I, how are the ladies, and your uncle? Ah &s;ir, an&s;wered the good youth, they are but &s;o, &s;o,&mdash;Mi&s;s Alicia is very indifferent indeed: the hou&s;e looks as if it wanted &s;omething: methoughts too my young Lady, has&mdash;but I a&s;k pardon, &s;ir: mayhap I &s;hall &s;ay more than becomes me. Speak on, Benjamin, rejoined I, I am your friend&mdash;Sir, replies Ben, you are a <HI>goodlike</HI> young gentleman, as a woman &s;hall &s;ee; and as mi&s;s is a little <HI>melancholi&s;h,</HI> I can't help thinking &s;he pines a little bit after <HI>you,</HI> &s;ir: nay, &s;ir, don't be angry, but I I'm partly, al|mo&s;t
<PB N="9" REF="24">&s;ure of it, for&mdash;! For what Ben, &s;aid I, &s;miling? For did not you ob&s;erve, &s;ir, cries Ben, how her colour went and came the other day, when you and &s;he were &s;tanding at the parlour-door, and how &s;he blu&s;hed up, and was <HI>flu&s;tered</HI> becau&s;e I hap|pened to go by, and &s;ee you looking at one another&mdash;well, &s;ir, pray don't be offended, but &s;he's a &s;weet lady, and I am &s;ure&mdash;</P>
<P>Hearing Mr. Draper come down &s;tairs, I interrupted Benjamin, by jo|co&s;ely thanking him for his intelli|gence, and telling him that, as I &s;aw he was a keen ob&s;erver, I mu&s;t mind my looks for the future.</P>
<P>This compliment &s;o perfectly de|lighted him (&s;uch is the omnipotence of flattery, from who&s;e in&s;inuating
<PB N="10" REF="25">qualities even &s;implicity is not guarded) that, with an unaccu&s;tomed air of &s;ufficiency he &s;aid, Yes, yes &s;ir, I gue&s;&s;ed in a moment, where-abouts the wind &s;at, and though I &s;ay it, who &s;hould <HI>not</HI> &s;ay it, I believe I can &s;ee as far intoa mill-&s;tone, as he that pecks it.</P>
<P>This ob&s;ervation lifted up the lad's head; and, like a man who had ju&s;t di&s;covered his &s;agacity, he &s;trutted away with as a&s;&s;ured a &s;tep, as if he had that moment dropt the commoner, and had a royal title, <HI>in futuro,</HI> to wear a &s;tar upon his coat, and a coronet upon his carriage.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XCVI.</HEAD>
<P>I had in my own mind given a week for the putting together my new cloaths, but how rejoiced and &s;urpri&s;ed was I to find a man with a bundle wrapt up in a green cloth at Mr. Draper's door, early enough in the &s;ame evening, for our meditated excur&s;ion: I ran up into my chamber followed by the man, who, as if by in&s;tinct, left his &s;hoes (in which, by the bye, he went &s;lip&s;hod) at the bot|tom of the &s;tairs: And will your honour be kind enough to try them on? demanded the fellow, betraying the broad brogue of his country.
<PB N="12" REF="27">My ma&s;ter will be <HI>after</HI> coming here <HI>with</HI> me in a moment. The Iri&s;hman &s;poke partly truth, for the botcher to the blood royal, ju&s;t as I had &s;trip|ped, came dropping his chin upon his brea&s;t, and &s;liding a re&s;pectful foot along the floor like a well-bred taylor, while the &s;hopman (who&s;e garters were gaping from the knees of his breeches) retreated as became him, &s;tep by &s;tep, in proportion to the ad|vances of his governor.</P>
<P>Your mo&s;t obedient, &s;ir, &s;aid the taylor in chief, permit me to a&s;&s;i&s;t you; helping me at the &s;ame time to put on the coat, and &s;aying I need not trouble my&s;elf about the breeches, as he was certain they <HI>mu&s;t</HI> fit.

<PB N="13" REF="28">certain of it: you have &s;uch a &s;hape, &s;ir, that a man hath credit in working for you. Here, Skip, looke here's a fall in the &s;houlders! Arrah ma&s;ter, an&s;wered Skipp, the <HI>gontlemin</HI> is a neat made <HI>craetur</HI> &s;ure enough.

<P>I complied with his reque&s;t, after which he exclaimed in a tran&s;port&mdash; There then, Skip!&mdash;there's a thigh &s;et off! there's wax for you!&mdash;why, &s;ir begging your pardon, you were really di&s;gui&s;ed before, you were indeed&mdash; for I do declare, you are a man of a million: had you indeed, been as crooked as a bottle-&s;crew, I could
<PB N="14" REF="29">have brought you into &s;hape, but you don't want any lifts from me. No, that's a &s;ure thing, &s;aid Skip. The ma&s;ter then, turned me round, &s;moothed my arms, and fa&s;tened the fir&s;t button of my coat.</P>
<P>Are they not a little tighti&s;h or &s;o, &s;aid I, &s;ir, over the brea&s;t here? Not at all, &s;ir &mdash;ea&s;y as a glove after an hour's wearing.

Upon this, I extended my right arm pretty forci|bly, and lo! the &s;titches flew from the elbow to the &s;houlder. I was pre|paring an ob&s;ervation, when turning about, I &s;aw the undertaker, tugging
<PB N="15" REF="30">vigorou&s;ly at the ears of the fini&s;her, who began to howl mo&s;t characteri&s;ti|cally. Sirrah, if you was not in a gentleman's hou&s;e, I would murder you for this, &s;aid the taylor; and then, coming to me&mdash;Sir, I a&s;k your pardon, I am grieved at the di&s;ap|pointment, but it is not my fault, I only cut out the work&mdash;here he wiped the &s;weat from his face, with his finger, and then, &s;napping that &s;inger again&s;t its next neighbour cried, Sir, I'll run the &s;titches over again <HI>my&s;elf.</HI> He then &s;quatted cro&s;s-legged on the floor, &s;aying, he was not, he thanked God, above his bu&s;ine&s;s, like &s;ome he could mention; and being &s;upplied by Skip with thimble, thread, needle, and &s;ci&s;&s;ars, he &s;oon repaired the damages.

<P>There was a looking-gla&s;s on my dre&s;&s;ing-table, that reflected my per&s;on in all the decorations of my new
<PB N="19" REF="34">dre&s;s; and really the taylor had done me ju&s;tice at la&s;t; for, whether I re|ceived any additions from a flouri&s;hed button-hole, or from the &s;able chain that bound the edges, or whether grey was more becoming to me than a darker colour, I cannot determine, but I certainly looked much more like a man, whom <HI>&s;omebody knew,</HI> and who <HI>knew &s;omebody,</HI> than I did an hour before; and that I might be, all of a piece, I indulged the vanity of em|ploying Mr. Draper's valet, to tor|ture my locks (which were rude and redundant) into ta&s;te. I adjoined to the&s;e advantages, the charms of clean linen, with the benefits of &s;oap and water, and made friends with the footman to make my &s;hoes as black and glo&s;&s;y as my &s;tockings. Thus
<PB N="20" REF="35">equipped, I walked&mdash;if I remember right, rather with more uprightne&s;s than u&s;ual&mdash;into the parlour. Draper had that moment done dre&s;&s;ing (his hair being fini&s;hed before I had left the taylor to the blood-royal) and po&s;&s;ibly, no man at five and twenty ever di&s;played a finer figure than he made at this in&s;tant: he was all elegance, ea&s;e, breeding and ac|compli&s;hment, with le&s;s vanity, and with more excu&s;es to be vain, than mo&s;t young people of the age. Upon my word, Benignus, cried he, as &s;oon as he &s;aw me, you are dre&s;&s;ed for execution; I was thinking of giving mi&s;s Dickens's poor old mother a call in the morning, and you &s;hall accom|pany me, for I am determined that Spangle &s;hall not po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o much
<PB N="21" REF="36">innocence; and, by the by, I have already taken care of that, and have received from the old lady a cordial invitation to breakfa&s;t. I will attend you, &s;aid I, with joy, and am almo&s;t ready to kneel down to you, as the guardian angel of endangered virtue. Very well &s;poken indeed, replied Draper, tying up his garter, and a very pretty &s;entence. Ha! ha! Guardian Angel indeed! I &s;ave the girl becau&s;e I would not have her fall into the hands of a coxcomb, who I believe cannot give her even <HI>carnal</HI> &s;atisfaction, in exchange for her cha&s;tity,&mdash;yet, &s;he will be ever &s;acred from any de&s;igns of mine: I care not how much beauty is thrown into my arms, by that mere jackal Tom Spangle; becau&s;e, if <HI>I</HI> did not receive
<PB N="22" REF="37">it, the fellow would leave it, after the fir&s;t night's lodging, to the bawd, or the &s;tews; and a ruined woman, &s;hall always find refuge either in my pur&s;e, or my bed-chamber, Benignus. But &s;till, ardent as I am, I bring no woman from the &s;hade of honour, to the &s;treets of &s;hame; whom I rai&s;e with one hand, I never de&s;troy with the other; and may this &s;word, which I am now taking from this hook, &s;end my &s;oul to eternal angui&s;h, if I would &s;educe the angelic wife of Sudberry, to be in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Grand Seignor's &s;eraglio. Not <HI>&s;educe</HI> her, I &s;ay Benignus; yet, if &s;he (of her own free will) preferred me to Sudberry, I would ru&s;h to her bo&s;om in all the luxury of throbbing expectation, let the con&s;equence be what it might.
<PB N="23" REF="38">By the by, Benignus, you &s;hould <HI>do</HI> &s;omething for that family: again&s;t their vi&s;it we will think of a method: at pre&s;ent, we have an evening upon our hands, and I de&s;ign to take care it &s;hall not hang heavily upon them.</P>
<P>The chariot was now ordered to the door, and we were driven in it, agreeable to Mr. Draper's directions, to a beautiful villa about two miles and a half from the town, &s;o that I apprehended he was going to pa&s;s the evening, with &s;ome agreeable family. &mdash; The hou&s;e was plea&s;antly &s;ituated at a proper di&s;tance from the public road, amid&s;t the umbrage of trees, the verdure of gra&s;s plats, and the variegation of flowers,&mdash;the air about this time grew extremely &s;erene,
<PB N="24" REF="39">and the door was opened to us by a female &s;ervant.</P>
<P>There is a &s;trange palpitation &s;eizes the young heart (accompanied by a certain degree of awe) whenever the eye is &s;truck with &s;cenes, to which it is unfamiliari&s;ed. I trembled to the very foot, as I entered a hou&s;e, of who&s;e inhabitants I knew nothing; and the conver&s;ation of Mr. Draper, a &s;hort time before, did not &s;erve to le&s;&s;en my confu&s;ion. We were de|&s;ired to repo&s;e a moment in a room&mdash; My mi&s;tre&s;s, gentlemen, &s;aid the maid &s;impering, is walking with <HI>the ladies</HI> in the garden. Very well, Lucy, cried Draper, we'll go to her there: come Sir James (&s;peaking to <HI>me</HI> under that title) let us &s;ee if we can find
<PB N="25" REF="40">them. The &s;ervant now opened a gla&s;s door, and we pa&s;&s;ed into the garden.</P>
<P>It was the middle of May, and the weather, which upon my coming to town was remarkably cold, was now, as remarkably warm; but, at the time of our walking in the garden, the evening breezes, brought with them the ble&s;&s;ing of coolne&s;s. The garden it&s;elf was delicious.
<Q><L>Of thicke&s;t covert was th'inwoven &s;hade</L>
<L>Laurel and myrtle, and what higher grew</L>
<L>Of firm and fragrant leaf; on either &s;ide</L>
<L>Acanthus, and each odorous bu&s;hy &s;hrub,</L>
<L>Fenc'd up the verdant wall; each beauteous flow'r</L>
<L>Iris, all hues, ro&s;es, and je&s;&s;amin,</L>
<L>Rais'd high their florid heads between&mdash;</L>
<L>Underfoot the violet,</L>

<PB N="26" REF="41">After we had rambled for &s;ome time amid&s;t "a wilderne&s;s of &s;weets," the &s;ound of a female voice came &s;oftened through the &s;hade, and on &s;tanding &s;till to li&s;ten, the trills of the tune, were &s;uited to alarm the pul&s;es of youth: when the &s;ong was fini&s;hed, we walked forward till we came within view of a bower, where &s;everal young ladies, with a matron in the mid&s;t, were drinking &s;herbet. My tremor increa&s;ed as I came near them, and yet I by no means wi&s;hed to retire. Draper addre&s;&s;ed the ma|tron with great familiarity, and, with as little ceremony, gave every one of her daughters (for &s;uch I thought them) a ki&s;s; de&s;iring me afterwards to follow his example: to which the young ladies &s;eemed to

<P>We &s;oon entered into &s;prightly conver&s;ation, for the ladies were by no means re&s;erved; and methought they talked a little oddly before &s;trangers, (for &s;uch <HI>I</HI> was certainly) about the delights of love, and the
<PB N="28" REF="43">voluptuou&s;ne&s;s of bathing at &s;un-&s;et. Draper too, was a little more free than I ever &s;aw him, even with the frolick&s;ome Alicia: he &s;aid, to one of the ladies, that a bed of violets, was the bed of Paradi&s;e&mdash;to another, that Eve &s;melt upon lilies when &s;he con|ceived; and to a third, that &s;he was &s;port for Jove. Pre&s;ently, we ro&s;e to ramble round the garden, (which however, in one particular was by no means like that of Eden), <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d it was not long before the company &s;cat|tered. I took advantage of this, and, entering a little thicket of nut-trees, began (as the reader knows it was u&s;ual with me) to whi&s;per forth my meditations. And whether hath thy changeable &s;tars thrown thee <HI>now,</HI> Benignus? Amid&s;t regions of real
<PB N="29" REF="44">&s;pring, or vi&s;ionary verdure? Among&s;t a circle of <HI>living</HI> beauties, made of mere fle&s;h and blood, or imaginary godde&s;&s;es? In one word: is it &s;ub|&s;tance, or is it &s;hadow? If &s;hadow, may'&s;t thou &s;lumber under the &s;weet enchantment for ever! If &s;ub&s;tance, &s;urely it is not more natural than it is <HI>innocent,</HI> to enjoy it!&mdash;What un|common &s;en&s;ations &s;eize me&mdash;I never felt &s;uch feveri&s;h, yet not undelightful attacks before &mdash; Heigho! how my heart &s;prings: how my cheek burns &mdash;what the duce is the matter with me&mdash;? Heigho! &mdash; I walked out of the thicket, and met one of the ladies, gathering &s;ome flowers which bordered the &s;ide of it. I a&s;&s;i&s;ted her, and pil|laged the whole bed, to make her no&s;egay. Don't trouble your&s;elf,
<PB N="30" REF="45">Sir, &s;aid &s;he, di&s;playing a dimple, and the mo&s;t regular ranges of white teeth I ever &s;aw. We walked toge|ther, and deviated from the paths into &s;ome &s;hady mazes&mdash;there, as we were gliding along, &s;omething caught her by the &s;hoe-buckle, and in at|tempting bri&s;kly to recover her&s;elf&mdash; &s;he fell down. Yet, where was all my good-nature? Where even my courte&s;y to a woman? I &s;urely lo&s;t it all, for though &s;he came with &s;ome &s;hew of violence (indeed &s;he fell, upon a paigle bank) I never once en|deavoured to take her up. Some how or another her gown (which was of the pure&s;t white) and her under garments (which were white al&s;o) were &s;o di&s;compo&s;ed by the tumble, that certainly, if I had re|tained

<P>This la&s;t &s;entence it was, which induced me to examine her eyes.

Saying this, &s;he bade me again interpret her look; and her character was now fully explained.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="52">The room into which &s;he con|ducted me, &s;eemed to have been furni&s;hed by Plea&s;ure her&s;elf: the mo&s;t voluptuous magnificence appeared on all hands, and every ornament was emblematic of the purpo&s;e for which it was admitted into the place. A large lu&s;tre was &s;upported in the center by a naked figure, in the act of lighting the tapers, while the cieling repre&s;ented the Graces binding the brows of a groupe of Bacchanals, with garlands of myrtle, intertwi&s;ted with ro&s;es. On one &s;ide &s;tood a crim&s;on canopy, on drawing the curtains of which I di&s;covered a &s;opha of the blacke&s;t &s;attin; at the top, Venus in a flowing rope of Tyrian purple was depicted in the attitude of pre&s;enting a veil, while Adonis, who &s;tood

<P>The &s;un was ju&s;t &s;etting, and threw his farewell beam directly into the room; &s;o that, as the canopy promi&s;ed to &s;hade us, we were obliged, in com|mon prudence, to place our&s;elves under it. About this time, her white hand repo&s;ed upon the couch, and &s;he had taken off her glove!</P>
<P>In contra&s;ted plea&s;ures there is a delicacy not to be re&s;i&s;ted.

<P><PB N="37" REF="54">As &s;oon as the &s;un was <HI>gone down,</HI> I ro&s;e, and felt the force of this truth a &s;econd time; that if <HI>to be good is &s;ometimes to be wretched, to be vicious is always to be &s;o,</HI> after the madne&s;s of the moment.

<P>As &s;oon as the chariot-door was &s;hut, I caught Draper by the hand, and exclaimed, O friend, how could you deceive me? You led me into the fire, and I have burnt my&s;elf to death.

<PB N="42" REF="59">However, not to in&s;ult the reader with the repetition of &s;cenes, that bring blu&s;hes in my face, even as I mark them upon paper, I &s;hall in brief inform him, that the mo&s;t dan|gerous of all pa&s;&s;ions, were now awakened: Draper, rather fanned than extingui&s;hed them&mdash;the path to per&s;onal exce&s;&s;es was now &s;hewn me: I was in the hey-day of blood, and I <HI>now</HI> &s;ought happine&s;s, not in benevolence, but&mdash;in di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
<P>And at this period it was, that the nicer delicacies of my character, and all the delightful &s;implicities of the country cottager began to fly off, and to leave me. For more than three months, I was a dupe to this hand&s;ome courtezan. She &s;ung, talked, looked, and embraced me into fa&s;cination.
<PB N="43" REF="60">Her extravagance however was un|bounded, and yet I was &s;ufficiently enchanted to attempt its gratification; to attempt it at the ri&s;que of fortune, character, and every thing el&s;e. I was &s;oon taught the my&s;tery of <HI>keeping,</HI> and in the fondne&s;s of my fooli&s;h heart, I took lodgings for this Dul|cinea, in the mo&s;t expen&s;ive part of the town. Such, at la&s;t, became my infatuation, that I had a pride in &s;eeing her eclip&s;e women of real fa&s;hion in the elegance of her per&s;on, and in the richne&s;s of her dre&s;s; and I even doated upon her enough to go with her openly into the places of public re&s;ort.</P>
<P>About this time however, I re|ceived a card from my agent, that a
<PB N="44" REF="61">little abated the violence of my career: it was to the following purport.</P>
<LETTER>

I now began to perceive that the con&s;equence of <HI>keeping,</HI> was a pretty &s;mart circum&s;tance; and the plain fact was, that I had &s;quandered away upon this artful woman, in a very few weeks a very tolerable fortune, with|out having done a &s;ingle action that can be recorded to my advantage. So far otherwi&s;e, that I neglected my accu&s;tomed pa&s;&s;ion for adventure, I &s;eldom vi&s;ited my old friends in the &s;quare, forget both Benjamin and Abrahams, and was fairly making large &s;trides from fa&s;hion and folly, to de&s;truction.</P>

<P>It &s;o fell out that we were di&s;ap|pointed of the promi&s;ed company of the Sudberrys on the day they had taught us to expect them; nor had either Draper or my&s;elf the happine&s;s of &s;eeing that amiable family for a con&s;iderable time afterwards. Poor Sudberry's di&s;temper gained upon him too forcibly, either for the love of his wife, or the friend&s;hip of Mr. Draper to remove, and more than &s;ix months elap&s;ed before he was able to leave his chamber: during which tedious interval, Mrs. Sudberry waited by his &s;ide, &s;moothed his pillow, and anticipated every wi&s;h that could
<PB N="47" REF="64">po&s;&s;ibly be performed by attention and tenderne&s;s. Nor would Draper, who in&s;i&s;ted upon it, this was <HI>his</HI> family allow <HI>me</HI> to &s;hew them a &s;ingle civility beyond a me&s;&s;age card, to enquire after the &s;tate of its health
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Let it be &s;ufficient to the kind reader, &s;hould he hear no more of this worthy family, to under|&s;tand that, when Benignus <HI>did</HI> enjoy its company, he found it re&s;tored to its merited tranquillity; not only by the principal's recovering his health, in a greater degree, but al&s;o by an unexpected good &s;troke of fortune in its favour, which placed it in a &s;tate of quietude and competency.</NOTE></P>
<P>Sorry am I to &s;ay, I was le&s;s <HI>anxious</HI> about the&s;e matters than formerly. It was the very period of enchant|ment; and I was pinned to the petti|coat of a Dalilah, without a wi&s;h, either to recover my liberty, or to revive my curio&s;ity. Plays, operas,
<PB N="48" REF="65">ma&s;querades, and tavern &s;uppers now took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of me; and Draper, who was always ready for either the vice or virtue of the moment, kept up the ball, led me by the heart through all the ceremonies of elevated pro&s;titution, and equipped me at all points as a man of gallantry.</P>
<P>It was in one of the&s;e polite rambles that I became acquainted with a per|&s;on through who&s;e means I was again led into the world. As I was one evening treading the tedious round of Ranelagh, with my enchantre&s;s leaning upon my arm, when Draper, who generally attended me, was acco&s;ted by a gentleman who pre&s;&s;ed him much to pa&s;s the night <HI>rationally</HI> at a tavern, whither &s;ome ten or a dozen hone&s;t fellows of the <HI>&s;et,</HI> as he termed it,
<PB N="49" REF="66">were to give him the meeting at eleven o'clock. Draper, who was always able to &s;way <HI>me,</HI> and, indeed, carry any thing he undertook, not only obtained my promi&s;e to accompany him, but al&s;o prevailed upon Lucy, (&s;o was my favourite called) to tru&s;t me from her arms: for be it known, that &s;he always affected to love me beyond mea&s;ure, and would frequently pretend &s;trokes of jealou&s;y on purpo&s;e to bind me the fa&s;ter. As &s;oon then, as I had conveyed Lucy to her lodg|ings, we called an hackney coach and drove to the &s;cene of appointment.</P>
<P><HI>Now,</HI> my dear Benignus (&s;aid Dra|per, in our way thither) you are going to a &s;et of characters utterly new to you. They are all of them men of &s;pirit, and talents; but profe&s;s to de&s;|pi&s;e
<PB N="50" REF="67">all forms and ceremonies, either in church or &s;tate, &s;ave &s;uch as di|rectly favour their own notions, prin|ciples, and modes of thinking. I very &s;eldom join them, though I am a member of their &s;ociety: the rea&s;on is chiefly, becau&s;e, as I told you be|fore, I hate argument, and the con|ver&s;ation to which we are going, though &s;upported with the utmo&s;t free|dom on all &s;ides, is <HI>wholly</HI> argumenta|tive. It is called the Society of Sy&s;tems, where every man vigorou&s;ly &s;upports his own opinion again&s;t every other, and offers either debates to defend, or rea&s;ons to recommend it.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding my attachments to my mi&s;tre&s;s, the pro&s;pect of my approaching entertainment had &s;uffi|cient attraction to awaken my curio|&s;ity,
<PB N="51" REF="68">and as the coach &s;topped at the door of the tavern, I felt my heart pant eagerly with expectation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. CIII.</HEAD>
<P>We were u&s;hered into a very &s;pacious room, wherein (for we were &s;ome minutes pa&s;t our hour) were &s;everal gentlemen, to the number of about twelve, &s;itting in a &s;emi-circle, and <HI>one</HI> mounted above the re&s;t, by two or three &s;teps, whom I di&s;covered to be the per&s;on that had given us the invitation, and who was, indeed, the Pre&s;ident of the Society.</P>
<P>As the debates were not yet begun, the Pre&s;ident, who&s;e name was Blake, de&s;cended from his &s;eat, and (as the
<PB N="52" REF="69">friend of their brother member, Mr. Draper) introduced me to the compa|ny, who were plea&s;ed to receive me very graciou&s;ly. After this he re|mounted, took his chair, gave the u&s;ual &s;ignal of preparation by tingling a bell, and the bu&s;ine&s;s of the night began.</P>
<P>Very fortunately for me, the que&s;|tions then to be agitated, were the very ones I had &s;o long been anxious to know the truth of; namely, whe|ther Providence had acted partially, or otherwi&s;e, in regard to terre&s;trial di&s;pen&s;ations, and <HI>which</HI> &s;y&s;tem, of all the infinite <HI>variety</HI> of &s;y&s;tems, was really mo&s;t conducive to human wi&s;|dom, dignity, and happine&s;s?"</P>
<P>Now then, thought I, now &s;hall I indeed be &s;atisfied; now will the grand &s;ecret, that has &s;o long puzzled
<PB N="53" REF="70">me, be developed: I am among&s;t men of meditation, liberty, and ex|perience; and this is a&s;&s;uredly the very night that &s;hall &s;ettle my opini|ons, and e&s;tabli&s;h my hitherto fluctua|ing ideas, upon the &s;olid ba&s;is of conviction: my <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> notion how|ever is, that the felicity of life can|not be perfect without a <HI>mi&s;tre&s;s.</HI> Heigho!&mdash;I wi&s;h my Lucy could &s;it by my &s;ide, and enjoy with me this "fea&s;t of rea&s;on, and this flow of &s;oul." Heigho&mdash;now for it: now for it.</P>
<P>Scarce had I indulged this &s;oliloquy, before a pale, tall, &s;keleton figure ro&s;e up, and in a voice at once &s;hrill, pier|cing, and complaining, thus addre&s;&s;ed the Pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;hew you, Mr. Pre&s;ident, what true happine&s;s <HI>is,</HI> by telling you
<PB N="54" REF="71">what, of all other things, it is <HI>not.</HI> Is it a que&s;tion, whether Providence has been partial or not? Look at me, I am an in&s;tance of the partiality of Provi|dence. The only poor man of the &s;ociety is now &s;peaking; and I will take upon me to prove, that happine&s;s is every where, but in the garret of an author. When nature makes a poet, gentlemen, &s;he makes a crea|ture as little able to &s;tand alone, and bu&s;tle it thro' the dirty and difficult ways of this world, as if &s;he had given him but one leg; and I will <HI>prove</HI> it. It may be &s;aid indeed, that an author hath the talents of genius, though he he hath not the pur&s;e of fortune. He hath, you will &s;ay, the <HI>poetic</HI> power of building palaces, without either brick, cement, mathematics, or mortar; he
<PB N="55" REF="72">can de&s;cribe with the &s;ame facility he adorns; the gardens bloom at his bid|ding, and the flowers &s;hoot up into beauty, and &s;catter fragrance, as he <HI>waves a feather.</HI> What of that? can the&s;e be a &s;orrier privilege than <HI>his,</HI> who is able to &s;pread a <HI>vi&s;ionary</HI> ban|quet, order &s;ervants to attend in their be&s;t liveries, and a&s;&s;emble together the polite&s;t company, when <HI>he</HI> who feedeth the ravens knoweth, that, in point of &s;ub&s;tantial eating and drink|ing, this identical poet, could as &s;oon command the portals of the trea&s;ury to turn upon their hinges, and open their coffers in obedience to his com|mands, as he could procure, either by ca&s;h or credit, the chicken that is roa&s;t|ing upon the luxurious &s;pit of an illi|terate alderman. What a multitude
<PB N="56" REF="73">are thrown monthly, weekly, hourly, daily into the world, without the in|heritance of a &s;ingle penny; and yet with a &s;et of &s;ollicitous cravings, which demand gratification? you mu&s;t know Mr. Pre&s;ident, that <HI>I</HI> am one of the many, who have real and &s;ound rea&s;ons for thinking there are very unpardonable inequalities in the divi&s;ion of human property. Even as I lay in the cradle I was de&s;erted by fortune; nature gave me a knack at book-making, and I have now for many years earned my bread by the fatigue of my fingers: not a dinner but what I extorted from the &s;tandi&s;h; not a bed, but I literally <HI>made</HI> it, of gee&s;e feathers: in the day I worked with the quills upon the wing, that I might &s;lumber at night upon the down
<PB N="57" REF="74">of the bo&s;om; and yet, after all, in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> years of my apprentice&s;hip, I did little more than pluck the bird, for the table of my book&s;eller. He fea&s;ted upon the body, and I &s;tarved upon the feathers. Now will any man pre&s;ent pretend to &s;ay, there is not a mo&s;t <HI>mon&s;trous</HI> di&s;proportion between the different fates of book&s;ellers and their authors? Surely, Mr. Pre&s;ident, all the Deities, nether and upper, were a&s;leep; &s;urely they had no eye to the operations of <HI>matter</HI> and <HI>motion,</HI> when the&s;e crooked deeds were doing! I will maintain it, &s;ir, that a poet, ought to be in every re&s;pect as happy, ought to have as good a &s;hare of this life's comforts as a book&s;eller&mdash;&s;hall a being, who exi&s;ts by the purcha&s;e of a commodity, of the true value of
<PB N="58" REF="75">which he is as ignorant as the animal|cula at the verge of his no&s;trils; &s;hall a fellow, who lives by the &s;ale of an|other man's brains, fare better, look &s;leeker, and &s;leep &s;ofter than the very poets that furni&s;h them with the com|modity it&s;elf? I &s;ay, therefore, and I will &s;upport it with my dying breath, authors are not &s;ufficiently con&s;idered by Providence; and a poet is the only creature of all creatures created, that is ab&s;olutely neglected.&mdash;I &s;ay likewi&s;e Mr. Pre&s;ident&mdash;I &s;ay that&mdash;that&mdash;I &s;ay&mdash;&s;ir&mdash;</P>
<P>Here the &s;troke of a hammer from the Pre&s;ident, knocked down both the author and his argument, in the &s;ame in&s;tant: for by the laws of this &s;ociety, no man (unle&s;s his eloquence was particularly attracting) was al|lowed
<PB N="59" REF="76">to &s;peak upon any given &s;ub|ject, more than ten minutes; and, from his &s;trange method of utterance, the poet had exhau&s;ted his &s;tipend long before he had half run him&s;elf out.</P>
<P>The poet was no &s;ooner &s;eated, than another member was upon his legs, and waving a white handker|chief in his hand with an air of gen|teel importance, thus began to har|rangue.</P>
<P>The worthy and learned member who &s;poke la&s;t, Mr. Pre&s;ident, hath di&s;played his ingenuity, at the expence of his veracity. It were ea&s;y to prove that the life of a poet is by no means &s;o unhappy as he has coloured it; and that all his local di&s;tre&s;&s;es are richly compen&s;ated by adequate ble&s;&s;ings, and by priviledges peculiar to the poe|tical
<PB N="60" REF="77">character. Hath not the poet all the advantages and all plea&s;ures of li|terary reputation? Hath he not all the delights of fancy? Can he not paint&mdash;can he not de&s;cribe&mdash;can he not <HI>create?</HI> Hath he not the huzza of printed popularity, always &s;nouted be|fore him? Do not all the honours be|long to him, <HI>jure divino,</HI> that re&s;ult from the laurel, the whi&s;per, and the bu&s;y buzz of celebrity? Doth not the pointed &s;inger pur&s;ue him, where|&s;oever he goes? Is not every lip upon the officious echo, telling us that <HI>there he goes, that's he, that's</HI> the famous Mr. Such-a-one? And do not the&s;e, together with a fame handed down by the hi&s;torians from generation to to generation, more than make a|mends for temporal inconveniences?
<PB N="61" REF="78">Mr. Pre&s;ident, it is not to be di&s;puted; the life of a poet is not a bad life, nay &s;ir, I will take upon me to prove that it is a life, to all intents and purpo&s;es, <HI>enviable,</HI> when compared with many others. What think you, &s;ir, of the life of a <HI>patron?</HI> Is there any being among&s;t all orders created, placed in &s;o horrid a &s;ituation as a <HI>patron?</HI> A patron, &s;ir, I have the misfortune to <HI>know,</HI> is fixed by de&s;tiny as it were between two tremendous rocks: on <HI>this</HI> &s;ide of him glooms a Charybdis; on <HI>that</HI> a Scylla. If he <HI>patronizes</HI> he is for ever pe&s;tered with dunces; if he <HI>refu&s;es</HI> to &s;wallow the flummery of de|dication, he is immediately purged with a do&s;e of lampoon. Now I humbly &s;ubmit it to your judgment, if it is not a mo&s;t ungracious bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="62" REF="79">to be for ever upon the harra&s;s&mdash;to have one's doors be&s;et and be&s;ieged by a parcel of harpies, armed again&s;t one's pocket not only with <HI>talons,</HI> but <HI>ta|lents?</HI> Are we not obliged to keep an extra &s;ervant, on purpo&s;e to repeat the lye of the day to every man that hath the look of an author about him? Are we not for ever upon the fret by the ferment of printed contradictions! What temper can po&s;&s;ibly bear the thou&s;and attacks that are made upon our pur&s;es, by dunces in every form? This man pre&s;enting his poem; that his play; <HI>this</HI> plucking you by the &s;leeve with a de&s;cription of your country hou&s;e, which you &s;ee every day in the &s;ummer, as the Lord made it; <HI>that</HI> &s;kulking in a corner, to &s;eize you as you come from a morning's ride,
<PB N="63" REF="80">with a ra&s;cally li&s;t of &s;ub&s;criptions. Is it not pitiable that a man of property, merely becau&s;e he <HI>hath</HI> property, &s;hould be eternally invaded by the tribe of &s;cribblers&mdash;and that he &s;hould be pelted through all the twelve months in the year, both by pro and con, by que&s;tion and re&s;pon&s;e, and &s;tand the &s;hot of &s;impletons and &s;y&s;|tem-mongers, without any thing ei|ther for the lo&s;s of money or labour, except <HI>wa&s;te</HI> paper. Upon the&s;e ac|counts therefore, Mr. Pre&s;ident, and many others to which patronage is heir to, I do not &s;cruple to pronounce <HI>happine&s;s</HI> more out of the reach of a patron than any other character upon the face of the earth: for which rea|&s;on I conceive that <HI>I</HI> (who have at this moment lying on my window-&s;eats

<HEAD>CHAP. CIV.</HEAD>
<P>A third member began, as &s;oon as the &s;econd had fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t heard, Mr. Pre&s;ident, &s;ome very able arguments in regard to the mi&s;ery of poets and patrons; and indeed, for my own part, I am of opinion, that a patron <HI>is</HI> among&s;t the mo&s;t wretched of all God's works: perhaps he has no <HI>equal,</HI> if we except the fate of the man who really has a <HI>pa&s;&s;ion for reading,</HI> and an ability as well as an ambition to purcha&s;e libraries.
<PB N="65" REF="82">To my di&s;tre&s;s be it &s;poken, I ever had a curio&s;ity both to look at and into a great variety of volumes, and, for near thirty years of my life, &s;carce any thing, on any &s;ubject came out, that I had not patience enough to examine it.</P>
<P>The Alps and Pyrenees of literature &s;unk before me. Folios, quartos, octavos, duodecimos, and &s;o on to &s;ingle &s;ermons; poems publi&s;hed by <HI>de&s;ire of friends;</HI> dedications, <HI>by permi&s;&s;ion,</HI> two penny e&s;&s;ays, penny &s;onnets, half|penny elegies, and farthing epigrams, all, all had their &s;hare, of my money and my attention. I was, indeed, what might very well be termed, a univer&s;al reader; and my experience now tells me, that there is no wretch|edne&s;s like <HI>his,</HI> who putteth his tru&s;t
<PB N="66" REF="83">in &s;y&s;tems. In the cour&s;e of my readings, &s;ir, I have found the twenty|four letters of the alphabet, twenty thou&s;and times pro&s;tituted: they have been perverted to innumerable ill pur|po&s;es, and among&s;t others, to draw the deep veil of midnight over the fair form of Truth: to create an ar|tificial chaos, where Nature, and the God of it &s;aid, <HI>Let there be light:</HI> to re-produce anarchy in the age, that ought to be the age of order: to puzzle the palpable, and make the opaque &s;till more ob&s;cure; and all this, under the pretext of opening our eyes, and &s;etting us right. If the patron complains of poets, I loudly execrate &s;y&s;tem-mongers, &s;ir. Fie upon them! they have bent ten times treble that under&s;tanding which was
<PB N="67" REF="84">naturally &s;traight. While I continued in the &s;wathing cloaths I was in a &s;tate of nature, incorrupted. My eyes <HI>really</HI> &s;aw, my hands really felt; and had I been permitted to go on, I &s;hould have been intimate with &s;ub|&s;tance, and rejected &s;hadow: truth would have been my guide, nature my companion, and common &s;en&s;e my friend. In&s;tead of that, I lo&s;t my happine&s;s with my petticoats, and the very day I di&s;tingui&s;hed my &s;ex to the public, by a&s;&s;uming the breeches, was the fir&s;t time I recollect to have &s;een the form of fal&s;hood. The mo|ment, Mr. Pre&s;ident, that I began to &s;ee, feel, touch, ta&s;te, and &s;mell objects as they actually <HI>were,</HI> I was taught to con&s;ider them, as they actually were <HI>not:</HI> but, according to the lights
<PB N="68" REF="85">wherein men (or rather children <HI>like</HI> men) in&s;i&s;ted upon it they <HI>&s;hould</HI> be. The fir&s;t non&s;en&s;e that mi&s;led me, was the nur&s;e's; and from her, I was promoted to the deceits of a &s;chool|ma&s;ter. By the one I was made to do as I was <HI>bid,</HI> at the peril of being given to a bug-bear in a white &s;heet, who, it &s;eems, always eat up naughty boys at a mouthful; or el&s;e, I was to be put into the burial-hole, or thrown to the beggar man: the con|&s;equence of this was, that I began to tremble at every thing white after it was dark, I fancied a bug-bear in every thing I &s;aw; I never beheld a new opened grave, that the fle&s;h did not creep upon my bones; and a ragged coat, or a long beard, always &s;et me on the tremble, lea&s;t the <HI>beggar|man
<PB N="69" REF="86">&s;hould be come for me:</HI> whereas, &s;ir, I am certain, had it not been for the&s;e pernicious documents, I &s;hould have con&s;idered a white &s;heet, as neither more nor le&s;s formidable than any other coloured object, and a tattered garment would rather have intere&s;ted my &s;en&s;ibility than awakened my apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>As to the &s;chool-ma&s;ter, I was compelled (by virtue of that magic &s;ceptre, which whips in at the tail, the wi&s;dom which is to accompli&s;h the head) to adopt all the ab&s;urdities of a pedant: and this prepared me for the &s;till greater ab&s;urdity of colleges.</P>
<P>Though I was by this time, well &s;itted for the &s;y&s;tem of univer&s;ities, yet I longed exceedingly to carry a halbert: but my parents were too
<PB N="70" REF="87">much bigoted to the old method of doing as <HI>others had done,</HI> and &s;o wi&s;ely re&s;olved to thwart <HI>natural inclinations,</HI> in favour of <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;toms.</HI> Thus, after going through the proper cour&s;e (as it is <HI>improperly</HI> called), they de|termined my genius to what&mdash;as they u&s;ually do&mdash;it had the greate&s;t re|pugnance:&mdash;even to the CHURCH. To this end, I in&s;erted my name in the college-books, and I &s;tudied with an intentne&s;s, that impaired the &s;ight of my &s;oul, even more than that of my body. Weak however as I was, my curio&s;ity was vigorous as ever, till at length, accu&s;tomed to delu&s;ion, I forgot the horror with which I viewed her deformity in my child|hood, fancied charms in her per&s;on, admired the force of her intellect, and
<PB N="71" REF="88">adopted her as the friend and guardian of my &s;tudies. By this time, Mr. Pre&s;ident, I had a pa&s;&s;ion for &s;y&s;tems, and purcha&s;ed, agreeable to her point|ing out to me, a &s;y&s;tematical collec|tion of books, among&s;t which were all the pens, <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con.</HI> of church|hi&s;tory, chri&s;tianity, dei&s;m, and athei&s;m. I was taught to believe, that a complete cla&s;&s;ical, critical pa&s;tor, &s;hould look with a nice eye, at the &s;ound and the rotten, the credulous and the incredulous, the Calvini&s;t and the Caviller&mdash;the Ro|man and the Prote&s;tant, the Metho|di&s;t and the Moravian. A very grave per&s;on told me, that it behoved me to examine all creeds, all faiths, and all orders of created beings, whether Chri&s;tian, Jew, Gentile, or Turk: that
<PB N="72" REF="89">it would be working in the way of my profe&s;&s;ion, if, not contented with tho&s;e obvious truths that lay upon the &s;urface of the &s;criptures, I would peep into the by-ways, allies, nooks, and corners of the multitudinous per&s;ua|&s;ions, tenets, and opinions of men, with a &s;ort of virtuo&s;o vigilance.</P>
<P>Undaunted by the appearance of &s;o gigantic a labour, I began the great work, purblind as I was: but, not to trouble you, Mr. Pre&s;ident, with the particulars of a long &s;tory, I &s;hall ac|quaint you, that about the time I had &s;poiled my eyes, and di&s;tracted my head with an attention to thirty com|mentaries in <HI>folio,</HI> upon my Bible in two <HI>pocket</HI> volumes, my vigilance was rewarded by the pre&s;entation of an excellent living. I &s;oon retired to an
<PB N="73" REF="90">admirable par&s;onage, where I was told by my phy&s;icians a plea&s;ant pad, the country air, regular duty, regular diet, the exerci&s;es of my office, and my tithe pigs would bring me about again.</P>
<P>The Sunday after my commencing pa&s;tor, I de&s;igned to introduce my&s;elf to my new pari&s;hioners, in a kind of dedicatory di&s;cour&s;e; and, de&s;iring to adapt a &s;uitable text thereto, I &s;ixt upon a ver&s;e, by no means in|appo&s;ite, though &s;omewhat peculiar. Its &s;ingularity engaged my curio&s;ity, and my curio&s;ity &s;ent me into my library, to make an enquiry among&s;t the <HI>annotators.</HI> Thirteen to the dozen of the&s;e, did I examine upon the ver&s;e, the context, and the whole chapter; and I remember well, I entered the
<PB N="74" REF="91">library with the watch in my hand, about four o'clock on the Thur&s;day eve: I read till bed-time that night: I ro&s;e with the &s;un the next day, and, with &s;hort intermi&s;&s;ions, was upon the &s;earch even to his down-&s;etting. It was the bu&s;ine&s;s of Saturday to ac|count for &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing a variation in the &s;en&s;e of the &s;ame ver&s;e in every commentary. I compared one with another, and endeavoured to reconcile &s;o many learned contradictions: but how was I alarmed, Mr. Pre&s;ident, when in the pur&s;uit of &s;y&s;tematic and orthodox accuracy, I heard the &s;ummons of the &s;abbath duty &s;teal upon me unprepared. Yes, &s;ir, I &s;wear by my ca&s;&s;ock, the &s;ermon-bell was upon the toll when I had not &s;o much as penned a &s;lip of paper upon
<PB N="75" REF="92">the &s;ubject I had &s;o long contemplated. I hurried on my band and gown, caught at the fir&s;t &s;ermon that offered it&s;elf to my hand, and running to the de&s;k without &s;topping to put on the &s;urplice, began in a trembling voice, to read the &s;ervice. But now, &s;ir, mark the up&s;hot of that utter con|fu&s;ion into which I was thrown by tho&s;e mo&s;t villainous commentators.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides that I had wholly lo&s;t the chain of the argument I meant to pur&s;ue, the &s;ermon, which, in the precipitation of my &s;oul, I had brought with me, was no other than <HI>that</HI> (of which the third was Latin) preached before my lord the bi&s;hop, and a learned body at my induction; and, to complete the matter, I had upon my head, in&s;tead of a canonical
<PB N="76" REF="93">full-bottom, the very cap of purple velvet, that I u&s;ually wore in the la|borious hours of delving into the pith of &s;y&s;tems.</P>
<P>And yet, Mr. Pre&s;ident, notwith|&s;tanding the perplexity I was thrown into by the annotators, when I con|&s;ulted them upon a pa&s;&s;age of &s;crip|ture, and ran my fooli&s;h no&s;e again&s;t the &s;tumbling-blocks of tho&s;e di&s;mally dark explicators&mdash;notwith&s;tanding the&s;e misfortunes, &s;ir, I am now&mdash;what you &s;ee me&mdash;of re&s;pon&s;ible corpulence, and of decent bodily dimen&s;ions; and had I not already too much tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed on your indulgence, I would inform you, what <HI>I feel</HI> to be HAPPINESS, and what, being now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, I would not part with, either for the vi&s;ions of poetry, the pride of pa|tronage,
<PB N="77" REF="94">or any thing el&s;e upon the globe. I have found out real felicity, Mr. Pre&s;ident, and I will not &s;uffer her to depart again from me.</P>
<P>The whole company were &s;o en|tertained by this venerable &s;peaker, (who appeared to be &s;tepping into his &s;eventieth year, and yet commanded attention, both by his manner and appearance) it was the unanimous de&s;ire of the &s;ociety, that the Pre&s;ident &s;hould di&s;pen&s;e with ordinary cere|monies, and allow the gentleman to fini&s;h his &s;tory, in which he was to di&s;cover the road to <HI>real</HI> HAPPINESS.</P>

<P>The torrid &s;corchings of mid&s;um|mer (continued the gentleman) are wonderfully inau&s;picious to both man and bea&s;t in certain di&s;tempers which affect the cerebellum: under the&s;e, the dog froths at the mouth, the bull bellows to Boreas for air; and the violent writer, and violent reader, are both ready for the whip and &s;traight wai&s;tcoat. But when the fiercene&s;s of the day is over, and the world is kept from fainting, at the &s;ame time that vegetation is recovered from her &s;woon, by the night breezes, it is as likely a time for an <HI>interval,</HI> as any in the whole year.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="96">It was, as I remember, upon an evening of this kind (when I had pa&s;&s;ed the hours of noon in all the furor of &s;y&s;tematic madne&s;s), that I was walking at the back of my par|&s;onage, in the meadow; when my ear was attracted by the voice of a per&s;on giving thanks. "The God of grace reward your worthine&s;s," &s;aid the voice. I looked over the hedge, and by the help of a gla&s;s, which the com|mentators obliged me to u&s;e, I ca&s;t my eye upon two figures very oppo|&s;itely di&s;po&s;ed. The one, a courteous hale looking man, was binding his handkerchief pretty hard round the knee of the other, which was neither more or le&s;s than a <HI>hor&s;e,</HI> that had, as I afterwards found, ju&s;t before thrown his rider&mdash;the very man, who
<PB N="80" REF="97">was now employed in &s;o humane an office.</P>
<P>He no &s;ooner perceived me, than he begged earne&s;tly that I would &s;tep over the hedge, and hold the bridle, this I did at the co&s;t of fir&s;t tumbling into the ditch, which my dimne&s;s prevented me from &s;eeing on the other &s;ide, and for which fall (as well as a thou&s;and <HI>other</HI> blunders) I may thank &s;y&s;tems, Mr. Pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>The owner of the bea&s;t, now began to &s;trip, and with the &s;ore-flap of his coat, to rub the blood from the no&s;trils, and the dirt from the fore|head of the creature; and la&s;tly, in a voice (where tenderne&s;s &s;oftened re|buke) thus &s;poke to the brute.</P>
<P>And wert <HI>thou</HI> affrighted; did&s;t <HI>thou</HI> &s;tart a&s;ide from thy path, for that
<PB N="81" REF="98">thou &s;awe&s;t rags and wretchedne&s;s in the way of thy on going? See what thou ha&s;t got by it. That fall, and the&s;e &s;marting te&s;timonies of it, are &s;o many judgments upon thy barbarity! So may every wretch fall; &s;o may every wretch meet a fate like thine.&mdash;Oh thou unkindly bea&s;t&mdash;who turneth from that through pride, to which he ought through &s;en&s;ibility to approach. And yet thou wert not wont to be &s;o cruel, and &s;o hard|hearted, neither: from my fir&s;t put|ting the bit into thy mouth, even unto this day, have I found no blame in thee, till this hour. On the con|trary, whenever I have ea&s;ed the traveller, or the beggar upon thy back, <HI>thou,</HI> as if &s;en&s;ible of the gentle ta&s;k in which I had engaged thee,
<PB N="82" REF="99">would &s;tep, as if on a &s;hoe of &s;ilk, and tread (even in the mo&s;t uneven paths) as thou wert treading upon a carpet of velvet.</P>
<P>For this one time I will heal thy brui&s;es, pity, and pardon thee&mdash;but&mdash; I charge thee to con&s;ider my clemency, and &s;in no more; for in the day that thou in&s;ulte&s;t misfortune a <HI>&s;econd</HI> time, thou &s;halt &s;urely die.</P>
<P>It was not till this moment that I di&s;covered a very poor creature of the female &s;ex, &s;itting in a pen&s;ive po&s;ture, with a &s;mall &s;cript by her &s;ide, and a baby ne&s;tled in the &s;oftne&s;s of &s;lumber within her bo&s;om; a bo&s;om, which in defiance of her circum|&s;tances, was white as &s;now. Pray, &s;aid I, to the hor&s;eman, who is that young woman at the border of the
<PB N="83" REF="100">bank? <HI>Who</HI> &s;he is, I really know not, replied the &s;tranger, but <HI>what</HI> &s;he is appeared to me &s;o manife&s;t a little while ago, that I was di&s;mounting to relieve her, when this cruel animal (pointing to his hor&s;e) affected to be frightened, flew out of the road, and as you &s;ee, got a broken knee and a bloody no&s;e for his pains: for which, though I love him tenderly, I am not &s;orry: however, if you will con|tinue to hold his bridle&mdash;as there is no tru&s;ting to man or bea&s;t, when the devil has once got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him &mdash;I will now go and perform my duty.</P>
<P>Saying this, the &s;tranger went to the young woman, gave &s;omething from his pur&s;e, and immediately re|turned.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="101">I reque&s;ted to know what &s;he &s;aid I know not my friend, any thing about her, replied the hor&s;eman, and the only words I ever heard her utter, were de&s;igned to thank me for not &s;uffering my hor&s;e to run over her, as &s;he laid fainting along the road.</P>
<P>But had you, &s;aid I to the &s;tranger, &s;o little curio&s;ity as not to inform your&s;elf of her hi&s;tory? I had &s;o little cruelty, &s;o little impertinence, an&s;wered he; I offered as much as my circum|&s;tances allowed; I gave her the mo|dicum I could &s;pare, and <HI>that</HI> was too little a recompence for what &s;he gave <HI>me</HI> in return. What did &s;he give you? A tear, &s;aid the man: lookee&mdash;'tis &s;till upon the back of my hand, verging to the very finger that brought my tribute-money from the pur&s;e; and
<PB N="85" REF="102"><HI>there</HI> it &s;hall remain: the heart from whence it ro&s;e, con&s;ecrated it, ere it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ell: I will not wipe it away; it will teach me <HI>&s;en&s;ibility.</HI> How came&s;t thou my friend, &s;aid I, by the&s;e peculiar &s;entiments? By whom wert thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aught them?</P>
<P>By nature, replied the man.</P>
<P>Who&s;e &s;y&s;tem ha&s;t thou &s;tudied?</P>
<P>The &s;y&s;tem of <HI>nature,</HI> &s;aid he.</P>
<P>He had now got his foot again within the &s;tirrup, and thanking me for the trouble I had taken, was preparing to go forward. As it was a fine evening, I reque&s;ted him to go &s;lowly, that I might enjoy the company of &s;o &s;ingu|lar a character.</P>
<P>With the mo&s;t ea&s;y and natural complacence imaginable, he di&s;mount|ed, joined by my &s;ide, and led the
<PB N="86" REF="103">hor&s;e in his hand. Within a few paces we &s;aw a boy with a hat in his hand, and in it a bird's ne&s;t, which he had ju&s;t taken, filled with young: ju&s;t as we pa&s;&s;ed him, he took one of the callow creatures from the hat, to&s;&s;ed it into the air, and then let it cru&s;h it&s;elf again&s;t the ground. My companion threw the bridle into my hand, and ran to the boy without &s;peaking; whom, after having held for a con&s;iderable while &s;u&s;pended by the leg, he thra&s;hed hand&s;omely with his whip, threw him upon the gra&s;s, and left him.</P>
<P>Wherefore did you beat the boy &s;o &s;everely, &s;aid I?</P>
<P>For the &s;ake of my <HI>&s;y&s;tem,</HI> rejoined the &s;tranger.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="104">Pre&s;ently we took notice of a per|&s;on, who (though having lo&s;t one of his arms) was extricating a lamb from the brambles, partly with his left hand, and partly with the &s;tump of his right: my companion hurried away to the man with inconceivable eagerne&s;s&mdash;a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash; &s;hook the maimed &s;oldier (for &s;uch he was) very cordially by the hand, and gave him money.</P>
<P>And what is all <HI>this,</HI> &s;aid I?</P>
<P>It is my SYSTEM, an&s;wered the &s;tranger, it is my SYSTEM: the only rational one in the world: the Sy&s;tem of Nature.</P>
<P>It was now almo&s;t twilight, and I was about to bid him adieu, not a little &s;truck with the &s;ketch he had exhibited of his temper. At this in|&s;tant
<PB N="88" REF="105">a hare, pur&s;ued by a neigh|bouring dog, cro&s;&s;ed our path. The &s;tranger threw his whip at the dog, with the utmo&s;t violence, and &s;napt the leg bone; then, rubbing his hands joyou&s;ly together, &s;kipt about, and &s;eemed infinitely delighted.</P>
<P>And pray what taught thee <HI>this</HI> action, I exclaimed?</P>
<P>My &s;y&s;tem, &s;aid the man (in a tone elevated at lea&s;t three full notes above his former articulation)</P>
<P>It began about this time to lighten: the thunder ran along the &s;kies, and the hemi&s;phere was in a blaze. The &s;tranger made a dead pau&s;e&mdash;folded his arms together &mdash; dropt upon his knee &mdash; bowed his head even to the earth, and went on. Rain &s;ucceeded the thunder: I was very thinly habited,
<PB N="89" REF="106">and had be&s;ides a &s;light cold upon me. The man &s;aw my di&s;tre&s;s, complained that the night was in&s;ufferably hot, and begged I would carry his great coat upon my &s;houlders&mdash;There was no re&s;i&s;ting him. The coat was on me in a moment, and the owner took &s;helter under an elm-tree, that offered a luxuriant arbourage by the road &s;ide. The &s;torm was &s;oon over, and the moon aro&s;e in all her &s;oftne&s;s, ele|gance, and maje&s;ty. The &s;udden ap|pearance of any glorious object &s;eizes our attention, and the &s;tranger hailed the ri&s;ing brightne&s;s with an unaf|fected fervor of gratitude.</P>
<P>Pray &s;ir, &s;aid I, have you <HI>read</HI> much? The Bible, &s;ir, he replied, and two <HI>other</HI> books.</P>
<P>What are they?</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="107"><HI>The&s;e,</HI> rejoined the man, the volume of Nature, and the volume of Shake|&s;pear?</P>
<P>Why Shake&s;pear?</P>

<P>I went home, Mr. Pre&s;ident&mdash;made a &s;acrifice of all my Annotators, the next morning, to Nature; bought Shake&s;peare; purcha&s;ed his whole works; &s;tudied my Bible without a Commentary; altered my Sy&s;tem; embraced Nature, obeyed her <HI>real</HI> dictates, and from that very time began to recover apace, till, in the end, I got fle&s;h upon my bones,

<P>This member had no &s;ooner ended, than every one te&s;tified his appro|bation by clapping his hands; and yet, late as it was in the night, or rather early as it was in the morning, a fourth member aro&s;e to addre&s;s the Pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>The per&s;on that now &s;tood up, had a deep gloom upon his face, his brow was pur&s;ed into a &s;ettled frown, and very rigid features (together with a hoar&s;e, querulous voice) rendered him extremely forbidding: yet he had a penetrating eye, and did not want
<PB N="92" REF="109">words. In &s;hort, he was a downright Freethinker, and thus, to my entire amazement, &s;hewed him&s;elf off.</P>
<P>Mr. Pre&s;ident, I have this night heard many plea&s;ant, many learned, and many ingenious ob&s;ervations, upon the &s;ubject of Human Happi|ne&s;s. But, &s;ir, it often happens that plea&s;antry, learning, and ingenuity, have nothing at all to do with <HI>matter of fact.</HI> This, I conceive to be the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent. In <HI>my</HI> notion, we are hunting after a thing that never <HI>was,</HI> never <HI>is,</HI> nor ever <HI>&s;hall</HI> be. If we talk for ever, we &s;hall never talk our&s;elves into Happine&s;s, and my opinion mili|tates again&s;t every man that pretends to have found any re&s;t for the &s;ole of his foot. Sir, I will take upon me to prove, that according to the pre&s;ent
<PB N="93" REF="110">government and e&s;tabli&s;hment of affairs terre&s;trial, it is impo&s;&s;ible a man of found thinking <HI>&s;hould</HI> be happy. The &s;pace of territory on which we tread, is too unequally, not to &s;ay ab&s;urdly divided, to admit of it. I do not &s;peak, &s;ir, but upon deliberation: but after having turned this planet of ours on all &s;ides, I am obliged, upon the plain principles of common &s;en&s;e, to conclude that it is upon the whole, a very moderate planet, and that the contriver of it could be no conjurer.</P>
<P>At this expre&s;&s;ion, &s;ome of the members began to hi&s;s, and to cry, Down, down, down! but the Pre|&s;ident, ob&s;erving that the freedom of debate mu&s;t, on no account, be
<PB N="94" REF="111">checked, called to order, and the Freethinker proceeded.</P>
<P>Yes, Mr. Pre&s;ident, I will avow it, in oppo&s;ition to all the hi&s;&s;es of either bigotry or prejudice:&mdash;the world is a bad world, and all that it inherits, little better than "the ba&s;ele&s;s fabric of a vi&s;ion." It is too late to run into the detail, and therefore I &s;hall con|tent my&s;elf with a very few argu|ments. <HI>Why,</HI> Mr. Pre&s;ident, &s;hould there be di&s;proportions at all, natural, mental, or corporeal? Why &s;uch &s;tupendous hills, and deep &s;unk val|lies? Why &s;hould there be any de|formity? Wherefore &s;hould <HI>this</HI> poor fellow go pointed at by the &s;aucy finger through life, merely becau&s;e he hath a bandied leg, a wry neck, or a
<PB N="95" REF="112">bunch upon his back? Is any being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">reated, or are any of its limbs ludi|crou&s;ly di&s;torted by the &s;ports of nature, on purpo&s;e to be the laughing|&s;tock of another? What right has the raven to <HI>fly</HI> through the pure air, while the rational draggles it on foot upon the polluted earth? My very dog hath greater &s;peed than his ma&s;ter. Why, for the &s;ake of expedition, could not man have had <HI>four</HI> legs in|dead of <HI>two;</HI> and why, in the name of rea&s;on, are tho&s;e two unable (be&s;tir them&s;elves as they will) to keep pace with an a&s;s? Truly, &s;ir, I think mo&s;t matters might be mended. Why &s;hould the ordure of the brute be fra|grant, while that of the <HI>la&s;t be&s;t work</HI> of the mo&s;t &s;apient Creator is intoler|ably offen&s;ive? Tell me, ye who &s;tand
<PB N="96" REF="113">forth to defend the &s;upremacy of man, and the dignity of <HI>human nature,</HI> tell me why the mo&s;t <HI>beautiful</HI> part of it, is &s;o imperfectly framed, as to become a mere thoroughfare for the dirty work of dige&s;tion? Wherefore too, is the &s;eat of joy &s;o indelicately made, at the &s;ame time, the &s;eat of our actual off-&s;courings? And why pray, do we boa&s;t of our erect figure? I &s;ee nothing wherein to plume our&s;elves, as to <HI>that</HI> prerogative: if we carry our no&s;es nearer to the heavens, we thereby are le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of the per|fume of vegetation: if we were nearer to the earth, the more exqui&s;ite would be the &s;cent of the flowers that adorn its &s;urface: we might <HI>then</HI> &s;mell the violet fre&s;h as it grows: after being cropt, it langui&s;hes; and hence it is
<PB N="97" REF="114">manife&s;t, that the &s;allad of the hor&s;e, is more highly reli&s;hed than the lord that rides him.</P>
<P>Then again, Mr. Pre&s;ident, as to our <HI>appetites.</HI> Can any man of common compa&s;&s;ion think upon the&s;e, and the wile means by which their greedine&s;s is pacified, without quarrelling with the very teeth in his head? Why was I tru&s;ted with a periodical pa&s;&s;ion for the blood of innocence? Why mu&s;t the lamb leave its pa&s;ture, the fi&s;h its &s;tream, and the lark her &s;ong, for the voracious cravings of a fellow animal?</P>
<P>In regard to <HI>moral</HI> evils, why is the knave allowed, for many pro&s;perous years, the range of a palace, while the good man, yea, even the man after
<PB N="98" REF="115">God's own heart is limited to the gratings of a dungeon?</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to <HI>natural</HI> mi&s;eries, why am I to be wound up every twelfth hour like a mere clook, the &s;tructure of men's fingers? Wherefore not made to la&s;t longer together? Or rather, why am I &s;o crazily con|&s;tructed as to be in danger of di&s;|&s;olution from ten thou&s;and accidents, and to be actually decaying from the moment I am born? Are not the fir&s;t ten years of a very niggard appoint|ment of time, either whimpered away in the puling weakne&s;&s;es of infancy, or trifled out in the frivolou&s;ne&s;s of childhood? Are not five more groaned away under the &s;martings of the rod? And, by the bye, Mr. Pre&s;ident, what
<PB N="99" REF="116">right hath one being to give pain to another, upon <HI>any pretence whatever?</HI> Are not twenty years more, pa&s;&s;ed under the tyranny, and the &s;lavery of my <HI>pa&s;&s;ions?</HI> Are not love, hate, jealou&s;y, ambition, avarice, prodiga|lity, all in a con&s;piracy again&s;t me: each, by turns predominant, and all fretting my heart, agonizing my bo&s;om, di&s;tracting my head, and tear|ing my poor victim of a body all to pieces? Is not exqui&s;ite joy &s;o con|trived, as to do me as great an injury, and &s;hake my frame as violently, as the extreme of grief? Are not many of my days, in mo&s;t of my years, made often in&s;ufferable, generally in&s;ipid, by either the languors of &s;ickne&s;s, the throbs of anxiety &mdash; the mi&s;eries of &s;ympathy, and the innumerable revo|lutions,

<P>You have given me a good deal of mi&s;ery, Mr. Freethinker; pray, con|de&s;cend to reward me now with a lit|tle plea&s;ure: an&s;wer me but two &s;hort que&s;tions, and I wi&s;h thee a fair journey through the realms of interrogation?

<PB N="103" REF="120">this, and yet it had like to have been attended with &s;erious con&s;equences.</P>
<P>The freethinker drew his hanger, which he wore to defend him&s;elf a|gain&s;t the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of his fellow animals, and &s;wore, he would put me to death for the in&s;ult of calling him freethinker. The poet &s;aid, the li|cence of a &s;tranger to the regulations of the &s;ociety, ought to plead my apo|logy; the patron ob&s;erved, that he &s;aw author&s;hip &s;kulk under the pent|hou&s;e of my eye, and that he &s;hould not <HI>protect</HI> me. The prie&s;t left me to nature and providence, and Draper prote&s;ted, as he threw his body, &s;hield-like before me, that if any man dared but to touch a hair of my head, he would eradicate him from the face of the earth.</P>

The confu&s;ion now become general, and the Pre&s;ident ha&s;tily de&s;cended to di&s;arm the Freethinker, who was the only per&s;on that happended to have cold iron about him: the Pre&s;ident, &s;tealing behind, gave his hanger to the Prie&s;t, who ran off with it to the waiter: The Poet called the Patron a jackanapes for reflecting on author|&s;hip, which produced a &s;neer from the patron, and that &s;neer produced a blow from the Poet, and that blow a battle.</P>
<P>The Freethinker, meantime &s;allied up to Draper, who with a hearty good|will gave him a &s;lap upon the face, telling him at the &s;ame time, that he would do him for once, the honour to foul his fingers upon a Freethinker. The Freethinker upon this, doubled his fi&s;t, and flew upon Draper, while the Pre&s;ident declared I de&s;erved
<PB N="105" REF="124">thra&s;hing, for being the little in&s;igni|ficant in&s;trument of &s;o much confu|&s;ion.

And now, we were drawn up three deep, man to man, in a battle royal, victory remaining for a con&s;i|derable time doubtful. The Poet, hitting the Patron hard upon the right thigh, hurt his knuckles again&s;t the body of a certain &s;olid metal that was there &s;nugly depo&s;ited, in a pur&s;e of &s;ilk: and the patron, in return, &s;truck the man of ink upon the tem|ples, from whence i&s;&s;ued a noi&s;e like

Draper's victory too, was by this time manife&s;ted, for &s;triking the Freethinker upon the bridge of <HI>that</HI> no&s;e, to which he had &s;o much objection, this audacious a&s;ker of que&s;tions came to the earth even near enough to &s;mell the per|fume of the du&s;t thereof; and the triumphant Draper, (who loved up|rightne&s;s), &s;tood erect upon his body. At length however, like generous conquerors, we rai&s;ed our foes: forgivene&s;s was exchanged for the
<PB N="107" REF="126">pardon that was invited: the Patron put five pieces into the hand of the Poet, to prove, that patronage was after all, &s;uperior to poetry: the Pre|&s;ident &s;hook me by the hand, and declared him&s;elf to blame, giving me at the &s;ame time an invitation to vi&s;it his cottage in the country, and the Freethinker prote&s;ted he richly de|&s;erved twenty bloody no&s;es for inter|rupting any man, for the &s;ake of cere|mony, in the progre&s;s of fair argu|ment.

<P>A very beautiful morning was be|ginning to dawn, as we left the &s;ociety of Sy&s;tems; and I was &s;o full of the &s;trange contradictory circum&s;tances I had ju&s;t been a witne&s;s to, that I had no pa&s;&s;ion even for the long ab&s;ent arms of the expecting Lucy, and &s;uf|fered Draper to lead me even where he thought proper. After having walked (for the &s;treets were quite clear from either chairs or coaches) &s;ome minutes without &s;peaking, I pulled Draper by the arm, and de&s;ired his <HI>Sy&s;tem.</HI> To the very bottom of my &s;oul, I hate the very name of &s;y&s;tem, &s;aid he, and yet, as every man mu&s;t
<PB N="109" REF="128">form to him&s;elf <HI>&s;ome</HI> opinion of this world, and its government, this, Be|nignus, is mine. I admire the &s;y&s;tem ju&s;t as it &s;tands: I can &s;ee the hill and dale, bu&s;h and briar, dell and dingle, wood and water, lawn and labyrinth of life, without being of|fended at them, either in the moral or natural world: on the contrary, I think they form a con&s;iderable part of its beauty, and even of its conve|nience: a fig, Benignus, for the &s;mooth path alone; were it not now and then for the ruggedne&s;s of the mountain, we &s;hould be in&s;en&s;ible to the level of the plain: were it not for hurri|canes, we &s;hould cea&s;e to congratulate one another upon &s;un-&s;hine. I love variety, and the pre&s;ent world plea&s;es me &s;ufficiently upon that account. It
<PB N="110" REF="129">is in it&s;elf one general up-and-down: the human &s;oul abhors &s;amene&s;s. When Nature turns &s;o prudi&s;h as to quit her pa&s;&s;ion for variety, when &s;he is &s;o far gone, as to paint one tulip, or form one feature exactly like an|other, it is then time to tremble, Be|nignus; for, after that, the world cannot hold together another click of the pendulum: but there is no rea&s;on to fear: there are too many charms in the pre&s;ent agreeable &s;y&s;tem for me to complain of it: it hits happily my rambling temper: all the objects of it are plea&s;ing from their frequent changings; &s;treams love to meander, the very trees twi&s;t them&s;elves into a hundred &s;hapes, the many-coloured clouds are &s;hifting every minute be|fore us, wilderne&s;&s;es wind, flowers are
<PB N="111" REF="130">whim&s;ically varied: the ri&s;ing light wears at this in&s;tant a different face from what it will pre&s;ently wear: all things gratify my love of vici&s;&s;itude, and in &s;hort, Benignus, I am for a Sy&s;tem of variety.</P>
<P>Mr. Draper had ju&s;t clo&s;ed his un|connected remarks upon the debates of the night, when he told me that if I would &s;leep in Dover-&s;treet, he would &s;hew me a little manu&s;cript that he found &s;everal years ago, as he was &s;trolling in St. James's Park. It is a mere a fragment, &s;aid he, and, by the hand, was evidently the work of a female pen. The &s;ubject of which it treats, is that which we have this night heard &s;o circum&s;tantially di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed; and if you are not &s;ufficiently &s;ick of talking about happine&s;s, I will
<PB N="112" REF="131">give it you directly on my getting home.</P>
<P>I agreed to the conditions, having indeed le&s;s reli&s;h for a mi&s;tre&s;s at that time, than for meditation; and, upon our arrival at Draper's, he very obli|gingly examined his papers, and, after a pretty long &s;earch, found that, which will be offered to the reader in the next chapter.</P>

<P>As &s;oon as I withdrew to my cham|ber, I opened the paper, and read the following &s;entiments of a mind tranquili&s;ed by the angel of content. It was entitled, "The offerings of gratitude," and began thus.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="132">&mdash;Prai&s;e be to the benignity of Heaven! my fortune is not great, but my frugality is in proportion to it, and hence it is that my cup is full and my heart &s;atisfied. And yet are there not &s;ome &s;ad di&s;proportions; do we not &s;ee them, do we not feel them? What is to be done by tho&s;e who are born only to walk about a wide world without a friend? To what re&s;ources &s;hall &s;uch unfortunates retreat? Shall they beg? Let them beware of the beadle. Shall they borrow? Let them dread the pri&s;on. Shall they &s;teal their own nece&s;&s;aries from the &s;uperflux of another? Let them tremble at the halter. Mu&s;t they really, notwith&s;tanding, exi&s;t? Is &s;elf|murder the crime again&s;t which the everla&s;ting hath fixed his cannon?
<PB N="114" REF="133">Alas! what cour&s;e &mdash; what hone&s;t cour&s;e is to be taken? Could nature have contrived no method to have &s;atisfied the de&s;ires and wants of her <HI>poore&s;t</HI> children without their finding a &s;uccedaneum in criminal or illicit expedients? Could &s;he have made no con&s;titutional di&s;tinctions, proportion|ed to the &s;cantine&s;s of circum&s;tances? Was it not po&s;&s;ible to edge the palate of poverty only for the herbs of the field, the flowers of the fore&s;t, and the nectar of the running water? No: It appears not. Not a &s;ingle link in the great chain that binds us to one another&mdash;that chain, which, de&s;cend|ing from heaven to earth, is pro|perly the ce&s;tus of &s;ociety, the girdle which draws the individual to the &s;pecies&mdash;not a &s;ingle link of this
<PB N="115" REF="134">mu&s;t be broken. The mechani&s;m of Providence, intricate yet regular, may not be entangled, or injured, by the fanta&s;tical alterations of innovat|ing man. What then is to be done? Hath nature given being to any thing on purpo&s;e to torment it&mdash;given it eyes, to &s;ee that elegance which it may not &s;hare; wants, which though perceived &s;hall not be gratified; appe|tites, which &s;ollicit in vain; and feelings which are to be di&s;appointed: hath &s;he, like an improvident parent, be&s;towed life, without the ordinary means of contrivance for its conti|nuity? <HI>Then</HI> &s;hould we with ju&s;tice, refu&s;e to offer prai&s;es to the power from whom we have received no be|ne&s;its.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="135">But is this really, at any time, the ca&s;e? Ah no: Truth, with a &s;mile, utters a &s;entiment the farthe&s;t from it po&s;&s;ible. Far be &s;uch propen&s;e bar|barity from the more ho&s;pitable de|&s;igns of our governor?</P>
<P>&mdash;Prai&s;e be to the benignity of nature! where wealth is denied, be|hold how liberally &s;he gives the pro|per equivalents; hands to toil&mdash;head to project&mdash;&s;pirits to per&s;evere, or talents to entertain. Into the arms of the indigent &s;he hath put &s;trength, mu&s;cles more vigorous, form more athletic, or el&s;e &s;he allots an advan|tageous ver&s;atility,&mdash;a brain prolific&mdash; a &s;oul for enterprize, or &s;ome other capacity of providing for the exigen|cies of the day. <HI>All,</HI> or <HI>any</HI> of the&s;e, produce proper &s;upplies. Happy in
<PB N="117" REF="136">my <HI>own</HI> &s;ituation, doth the &s;igh heave, and the tear fall for the diffi|culty in which my fancy repre&s;ents the cottager involved? Hath the God of nature refu&s;ed her benignity to <HI>him?</HI> Here truth again &s;ettles the point agreeable to the benignity of Providence. Congratulate, &s;aith &s;he, the labourer, upon the bread that is to be earned only by the &s;weat of his brow: from his wants ari&s;e at once his virtues and his joys. Con&s;ider well what tho&s;e joys produce.</P>
<P>They produce health, who diets upon the ears of the &s;heaf, that he may &s;nore at night upon the &s;talks, formed without difficulty into a bed of tranquility. The &s;un, it is true, &s;corches; but then the poor man is <HI>&s;ea&s;oned</HI> to it, and while he "&s;weats in
<PB N="118" REF="137">the eye of Phoebus," he &s;toops to the exerci&s;e of the &s;ickle, whi&s;tles cheari|ly in his progre&s;s, and tells blithly to his companion the &s;tory of his la&s;t frolic. It mu&s;t be owned, likewi&s;e, that the rain often invades him at his work; but then it mu&s;t be con&s;ider|ed that the hedges are generally con|tiguous, and when they are not, the pa&s;&s;ing &s;hower is grateful to the heated hu&s;bandman. I will not deny the coar&s;ene&s;s of his raiment; but then it is the warmer upon that account. His food al&s;o is far from being delicate; but yet it is for that very rea&s;on the more whole&s;ome.</P>
<P>The &s;un hath ju&s;t made his "gol|den &s;et" in the we&s;t: the hours of labour are over. Now then look at the cottager. The &s;ickle is laid acro&s;s his &s;houlder: his elde&s;t boy trudges
<PB N="119" REF="138">after him with the gleanings of pa&s;|time in the one hand, and the emp|tied &s;crip in the other: his watch-dog, taught to keep the cloaths from the pilfering fingers of the vagabond, trots, plea&s;ed with his &s;ervitude, be|fore him: the zephyrs of the evening be&s;tow the gradual coolne&s;s; and the &s;ong of the nightingale attends him over the lees. Truth cannot yet be per&s;uaded to leave him: let us attend then, to the fini&s;hings of her picture.</P>
<P>The hu&s;bandman is now within &s;ight of his &s;hed; he is this minute plucking the latch of his &s;traw-built cottage. The hou&s;ewife hath left her wheel, and the children of this prolific matron, are playing the gam|bols of infancy upon the plain, clean, brick floor: the father's ki&s;s echoes
<PB N="120" REF="139">on every lip; the nur&s;e's non&s;en&s;e &s;inks the &s;weet dimple in every face; the little ones, for the &s;ake of com|pany, as well as convenience, lie &s;o|cially together: the parents retire to the nervous embraces of each other: hence another te&s;timony of the father's virility &s;oon appears. What of that? he only piques him&s;elf upon the ad|dition of his family, dandles the &s;uck|ling upon his knee at his return from work, melts even into tears as it re|po&s;es on the bo&s;om of the mother, and only works the harder to maintain it.</P>
<P>&mdash;Prai&s;e be to the benignity of heaven! all I &s;ee is right. For my own part, I do not envy even the cottager. My children are graced with all the elegancies of the human
<PB N="121" REF="140">figure; complexions clear, eyes bril|liant, lips rubied, &s;hapes exact. One is indeed at pre&s;ent indi&s;po&s;ed, but the warm &s;ea&s;on is at hand, and the ro&s;e &s;hall again revi&s;it his cheek. One <HI>is not,</HI> but it died in the mo&s;t innocent part of life: the pang of the parent is hu&s;hed in the bo&s;om of piety, and who knows, but it may now be the guardian cherub of my <HI>other</HI> little ones. My hu&s;band is &s;aid to be de|formed, but the power that permits him to be &s;o, hath &s;uited my eyes to his &s;ituation, and I cannot but think him hand&s;ome. He is now a&s;leep, wearied with providing for his be&s;t beloved, and her dear a&s;&s;ociates! what a ble&s;&s;ing is repo&s;e? I will go &s;it by his &s;ide, guard his &s;lumbers, and watch the hour of his awaking.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="141">Happy infancy! my younge&s;t is &s;porting with its plaything: Happy childhood! my elde&s;t is delighting it|&s;elf with the pictures that illu&s;trate the fable, painted and written to the ten|derne&s;s of the ri&s;ing ideas: Happy maturity! that be&s;tows upon one of either &s;ex, tho&s;e attractions which make them a world to each other. Ah! what &s;weet &s;en&s;ations move the heart of a wife, a parent, and a friend!</P>
<P>But, as the eternal &s;cale is for ever turned by the angel of indulgence, let me end as I began.</P>

<P>After having read the fragment twice over, with an attention that it appeared to merit, I went to bed: but never had I le&s;s inclination to &s;leep, &s;ince I came into this world. Every thing that had pa&s;&s;ed before me in the cour&s;e of the night, kept my eyes open, and my thoughts at work. The debates I had heard at the So|ciety of Sy&s;tems; the battle which put an end to them; the &s;ituation of my own heart in regard to Lucy, whom I had &s;everely di&s;appointed;
<PB N="124" REF="143">the contrariety of &s;entiment, reverber|ated from man to man, where&s;oever! went; and the doctrine of the frag|ment, all united their efforts, not only to prevent me from the enjoyment of repo&s;e, but from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing while awake the &s;malle&s;t degree of &s;erenity. The more knowledge I acquired of the characters of men, and the more re&s;earches I made after happine&s;s, the le&s;s was I plea&s;ed with my &s;urvey, and the le&s;s felicity did I acquire.</P>
<P>Nor was I a little a&s;toni&s;hed to find the &s;y&s;tem-mongers, all &s;upporting an oppo&s;ite opinion, and yet none of them cheri&s;hing that, which I then imagined to be the &s;ummum bonum: the plea&s;ures of a mi&s;tre&s;s, were never &s;o much as glanced at, nor did even Draper him&s;elf profe&s;s to adopt the Sy&s;tem of Love: on the contrary, he
<PB N="125" REF="144">avowed him&s;elf devoted only to the joys of variety.</P>
<P>Unhappy is he, who, in the days of his youth traver&s;es this intricate world, without a guide; and of all other prepo&s;terous pa&s;&s;ions, the mo&s;t prepo&s;terous is <HI>that</HI> which induces an orphan of fortune to tru&s;t him&s;elf to mankind, with neither experience to direct, prudence to advi&s;e, nor oeco|nomy to regulate. Let no man that is new to the active &s;cenes of a city, ever venture again into a metropolis, unattended: let no man indulge his inclinations for <HI>travelling,</HI> without fir&s;t con&s;idering that if he is mi&s;erable at home, he mu&s;t tread warily in|deed, if he does not <HI>increa&s;e</HI> that mi&s;ery abroad.

You put me in mind, &s;aid Draper, of a man I once knew, who, having heard much, and read more, pinn'd his faith upon the &s;leeve of another, and, at la&s;t, indulged him&s;elf in &s;uch habits of credulity, that he had no opinion of his own.</P>
<P>I reque&s;ted a &s;ketch of the per&s;on's &s;tory. This fellow, continued Draper, was an old &s;chool-mate of mine: he was always fond of books, but one of
<PB N="131" REF="150">tho&s;e random readers, who run over volumes, to u&s;e the common phra&s;e, as a cat runs over an harp&s;ichord: this ab&s;urdity grew as <HI>he</HI> grew, till about the time that he came to his for|tune, he was &s;o thoroughly variable, that, read whatever he might, he al|ways adopted the precept of the page in hand. One day he was a &s;ound philo&s;opher, and on the the morrow philo&s;ophy was driven out, as it were by the wedge of politics. He was an arrant literary turncoat, ever chang|ing, and never the better for it. To humour the &s;y&s;tem of one, he com|mitted private violences, for the &s;ake of public benefits; and had thereby brought him&s;elf within an inch of the gallows. To accommodate him&s;elf to two writers upon health, who di&s;&s;ered
<PB N="132" REF="151">materially upon the &s;ubject, he gave each of their &s;y&s;tems a month's practi|cal experiment: thus, in conformity to the one, he eat, drank, and &s;lept, at &s;tated &s;trokes of the pendulum; and, in compliance with the other, whenever he was hungry he eat, when drow&s;y he &s;lept, and when thir&s;ty he drank till he was &s;atisfied. A poem, on the plea&s;ures of melan|choly, written by Milton, made him, I remember, &s;it freezing under a yew tree, in the drear of December; and a &s;econd, on the joys of chearfulne&s;s, by the &s;ame author, induced him to collect all his friends together, and get drunk three nights running, for the &s;ake of conviviality. A little trea|ti&s;e, written many years ago, upon politene&s;s and manners, made him
<PB N="133" REF="152">alter the cut of his coat, the clip of his nails, the &s;queeze of his hat, the bend of his bow, and the &s;lide of his foot. He &s;hifted his religion much oftner than his linen. In his youth he read Virgil, and in order to follow the precepts laid down by that poeti|cal hu&s;bandman, he commenced far|mer and gra&s;ier; turned out his old tenants, and cultivated his own e&s;tate, upon Virgilian principles. Soon after this, the Iliad of Homer falling in his way, he &s;old his land, &s;ent his oxen to Smithfield, and, in&s;pired by the heroi&s;m of Hector, li&s;ted for a &s;oldier, lo&s;t his limb, and came glo|riou&s;ly back to his native land, with the &s;tump of honour. But now, a di&s;cour&s;e that was put into his hand at his return, on the plea&s;ures of re|tirement,
<PB N="134" REF="153">and the great <HI>riches</HI> to be found by a wi&s;e Chri&s;tian, in poverty, over-ruled him&mdash;pliable as ever&mdash;to purcha&s;e a cottage, where, to heighten the &s;cene, he read Cowley, Thom&s;on, and all the de&s;criptive poets. After this, he unluckily dipt into an e&s;&s;ay on ta&s;te, and the decoration of garden grounds, which &s;oon made him for|&s;ake his cottage, to embelli&s;h a curi|ous &s;pot, which, with the la&s;t folly|money remaining out of a competent income, he bought, and was proceed|ing to build, and lay out, exactly ac|cording to the <HI>lucidus ordo</HI> of his au|thor, when, unfortunately, in the very cri&s;is of his putting the fini&s;hing &s;troke to his hou&s;e, he paid a vi&s;it to a friend in Worce&s;ter&s;hire; in his way to which place, he marked out, as he
<PB N="135" REF="154">rode along, a &s;pot &s;till more conve|nient for his purpo&s;e, and command|ing exactly &s;uch a &s;ite as the author recommended. This di&s;covery &s;et him upon the gallop, till he found the owner of the ground, whom he addre&s;&s;ed that very evening upon the &s;ubject of the property. As he previ|ou&s;ly declared money &s;hould not part them, the owner, who de&s;igned to &s;ell, made his valuation accordingly; and now nothing remained, Benig|nus, but a &s;ingle objection. Upon putting his hand into his pur&s;e, he found it contained only forty guineas. Upon recollecting the &s;tate of affairs when he la&s;t drew upon his banker, he di&s;covered&mdash;nothing. Alas, poor Jack Bookwit&mdash;what could he do, Be|nignus? There are, my friend, events
<PB N="136" REF="155">in life, which un&s;ettle us from top to bottom, in&s;ide and out&s;ide, at once. A hard blow given by the hand of for|tune, when we expect a &s;mile, has occa&s;ioned many a whim&s;ical exit out of this world. Such was the ca&s;e with my old &s;chool-fellow, Jack Bookwit: the poor man departed very di&s;con&s;olately out of the &s;ight of the land-owner, unbitted his hor&s;e, which he turned to the clover of a contiguous field, made a melancholy u&s;e of the bridle, and was found dangling by the neck, the next mor|ning, a &s;acrifice to SYSTEMS, and a memento to the children of men, (and, among&s;t others, to thee, Benignus) now and then to follow their own no&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="156">When Mr Draper had concluded his &s;tory, he ob&s;erved, that the hour of his appointment was come, and (&s;haking me cordially by the hand) departed. I was now never more puzzled what to do; my &s;entiments had undergone a &s;urpri&s;ing change within a few hours, and I was at a lo&s;s whether to return to my mi&s;tre&s;s, or endeavour by ab&s;ence, to wean my&s;elf from a connexion, that a lit|tle &s;erious meditation had taught me to believe di&s;honourable. While I was debating betwixt pa&s;&s;ion and con&s;cience upon this &s;ubject, a porter brought the following card, and five minutes afterwards, the po&s;tman pre|&s;ented me with the letters that &s;ucceed it.

</LETTER>
<P>I was variou&s;ly affected by the per|u&s;al of the&s;e epi&s;tles, particularly by the two la&s;t: I was a&s;hamed at having &s;o ill returned my cou&s;in's invitations; and I was very unwilling to cultivate any farther the connexion, that had already &s;educed me into &s;uch num|berle&s;s
<PB N="141" REF="160">omi&s;&s;ions. My heart, I con|fe&s;s, pleaded but too pathetically the cau&s;e of love and Lucy; I felt the ab|&s;tinence I impo&s;ed on my&s;elf in its utmo&s;t &s;everity, yet I was now &s;o convinced of the impropriety, that, co&s;t me what it would, I was deter|mined to break acquaintance with this bewitching Syren, that was charm|ing me every hour more powerfully.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uit of this laudable re&s;olu|tion, I would not even tru&s;t my&s;elf to the temptation of a parting inter|view, but &s;itting down to the writing-de&s;k, while the tears were in my eyes, penned an an&s;wer to my mi&s;tre&s;s, wherein I, like a &s;impleton as I was, entered into long arguments upon the nece&s;&s;ity of leaving her. Among other things, equally cogent, I told her,
<PB N="142" REF="161">that, though I loved her tenderly, my con&s;cience demanded the &s;acrifice of a &s;eparation, which, however agoniz|ing, mu&s;t en&s;ue: that, her company captivated me, even to the de&s;truction of all other attentions, due to friends, relations, and what I owed to my own character: that I found my&s;elf unfit for any plea&s;ure, but the plea|&s;ures of her &s;ociety; and that, as tho&s;e were not &s;anctified by any laws, either divine or human, even the ta&s;te of the times, and the imprimatur of fa&s;hion, could not, upon delibera|tion, reconcile me to their enjoy|ment: that I lamented the impo&s;&s;ibi|lity of entering into a nearer, dearer, and more &s;acred alliance, without in|curring that cen&s;ure, which would inivitably attend &s;uch a mea&s;ure:
<PB N="143" REF="162">but that, neverthele&s;s, I &s;hould al|ways think it my duty, as it would always be my inclination, to contri|bute to her convenience, comfort, and accommodation, as to money-matters; and intreated, that my departure from &s;uch &s;cenes of tran&s;port, might be con&s;idered in the right light; not as the frivolous pa&s;&s;ion of a libertine, tired with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his object, and upon the look-out for another; but the re&s;olutions of a man who dared no longer yield to feelings that are manife&s;tly repugnant to that delicacy of conduct which alone pre&s;erves and &s;u&s;tains the character.</P>
<P>After having fini&s;hed my letter, which, all points con&s;idered, was &s;urely no bad effort of philo&s;ophy, I read it over with a triumph that cer|tainly
<PB N="144" REF="163">aro&s;e from the &s;en&s;e of a part well acted. On reading it over a <HI>&s;e|cond</HI> time, the &s;igh involuntarily broke from me at the name of Lucy: I found tender ideas again ru&s;hing upon me; and, le&s;t I &s;hould relap&s;e, I had the fortitude to inclo&s;e a bank bill, ju&s;t for her pre&s;ent u&s;e, &s;ealed it up with a religious ha&s;te, le&s;t my re|&s;olution &s;hould relax, and di&s;patched it by that &s;ervant of Draper's, who had been conver&s;ant in me&s;&s;ages of gallantry, &s;ince he came into the &s;er|vice of that gentleman.</P>
<P>I had &s;carce delivered it, before I wi&s;hed it again in my hand, and was more than once tempted to run after the me&s;&s;enger, and recover it: but, virtue at la&s;t prevailed over pa&s;&s;ion, and I &s;uffered in &s;ilence: nor dared I
<PB N="145" REF="164">wait the return of the &s;ervant, le&s;t Lucy's an&s;wer &s;hould contain &s;uch &s;oftening arguments, as it would be impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t. To vi&s;it Mrs. Darlington, however, was a bu&s;ine&s;s to which I was at pre&s;ent by no means equal; I was not prepared for the company of an innocent woman, and an amiable family: <HI>That,</HI> therefore, which at another moment would have been an in&s;ipid invitation, now be|came really acceptable; and I con&s;i|dered the &s;ociety at the White Bear, as a critical refuge from the angui&s;h of my reflections.</P>
<P>To this a&s;&s;ignation then I attended, as &s;oon as I could ri&s;e from the in|genious fingers of Mon&s;ieur Crimpa; and after I had left word for Draper, that I &s;hould certainly return in the

<HEAD>CHAP. CXIII.</HEAD>
<P>In my way to the White Bear, I endeavoured, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to command my thoughts from the ac|cu&s;tomed object of their tender con|templation; and particularly adverted them to the various adventures I had met in the metropolis, in my &s;earch after Happine&s;s. Full of the&s;e ideas, and wondering to find opinions &s;o ex|tremely di&s;&s;imilar, in beings who were of the &s;ame &s;pecies, and ultimately in pur&s;uit of the very &s;ame good, I was walking along in a &s;ort of philo&s;o|phical perplexity, when my curio&s;ity
<PB N="147" REF="166">was attracted by a groupe of females, whom I found &s;itting upon the lower &s;tone-&s;tep of the tavern door. As they were employed in a matter that &s;trongly interre&s;ted my feelings, I &s;tood &s;till to ob&s;erve them. There were two women and a child ne&s;tled between them: one of the women untied a dirty looking bundle, from which, &s;he took a mi&s;cellaneous heap of broken victuals, which appeared to be the &s;crapings of twenty tables. Having very cautiou&s;ly divided it into two equal &s;hares, with the &s;tricte&s;t re|gard to ju&s;tice, (in&s;omuch, that I be|lieve &s;he held the &s;cale &s;o evenly, a preponderating crumb prevailed nei|ther way) &s;he offered the parted &s;poil to the choice of her companion. When this point was &s;ettled, both the
<PB N="148" REF="167">women gave &s;omething from their portion to the infant; which, neither <HI>having,</HI> nor &s;eeming to <HI>want</HI> the com|fort of cloathing, looked eagerly upon the bu&s;ine&s;s in hand, as if, at fir&s;t, it thought it&s;elf not quite &s;o fairly treated.</P>
<P>When art &s;preads not her page|antries before us, nature is frugally and expediou&s;ly gratified: Their meal was the meal of a moment.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently, a little &s;tockingle&s;s boy, hearty, and happy in his nakedne&s;s, came running up with a can of water; the women took it, &s;hook hands, pledg'd health, &s;troaked the boy on the head, ki&s;&s;ed the child, and all was over.</P>
<P>I might now go up to the door, which they intercepted without di&s;|turbing
<PB N="149" REF="168">them: I am &s;orry to make you get up, good folks, &s;aid I, but &s;urely you have cho&s;en an unfortu|nate place to dine in? the door of a tavern is liable to a thou&s;and inter|ruptions. They got up. What a pretty &s;poken Gentleman, (&s;aid one to the other); yes, God love your ho|nour, to be &s;ure, we are often inter|rupted, but what little <HI>we</HI> have is &s;oon eaten: our lap is a table, our apron the cloth, and any place &s;erves our turn: boy, du&s;t away the crumbs with your hat, that the gentleman may not &s;oil his &s;hoes.</P>
<P>The humility of this expre&s;&s;ion touched me; what a di&s;tinction is here, (&s;aid I &s;oftly) without any in|trin&s;ic difference? Can the want of a decent dre&s;s occa&s;ion all this? at that
<PB N="150" REF="169">rate, if my cloaths were put upon tht poor man's back, <HI>he</HI> would a&s;&s;ume my con&s;equence, and <HI>I</HI> &s;hould, in|ve&s;ted with his tatters, &s;ink, of cour&s;e, into his ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s?</P>
<P>All this time the mendicants, in|&s;tead of the &s;allies of plea&s;antry, and &s;atisfaction that before ze&s;ted their repa&s;t, were beginning to mumble out their tale: the notes of content were &s;oon changed into the whinings of complaint, and they now &s;eemed to be as wretched, as they were before happy. A &s;trange alteration, thought I! however, I was determined to do &s;crupulous ju&s;tice, and therefore, threw them four &s;ix-pences. A &s;cram|ble en&s;ued: the boy caught up one, the woman with the child the three others, and made off, while the de|frauded
<PB N="151" REF="170">creature that remained, who was lame, in the mo&s;t piercing key of reprobation, &s;ent, upon the wings of the wind, &s;uch a volley of cur&s;es after her comrade, that I heartily de&s;pi&s;ed my&s;elf for having acted &s;o injudici|ou&s;ly, even where I imagined I was dealing &s;o exactly equitable. The cheats, turning into an alley, were &s;oon out of &s;ight, and the lame wo|man renewed her good wi&s;hes for their immediate perdition; and ju&s;t as I had got into the entry of the ta|vern, &s;he prevented my repairing her injury, by fairly telling me, in a language tolerably intelligible, that if I had been inclined to do a good thing, and be cur&s;ed to me, I might have parted the money my&s;elf, and not &s;et poor folks a &s;cuffling for a trifle, that
<PB N="152" REF="171">might break a good-will of &s;o much &s;ervice to both.</P>
<P>I did not like the malice that I &s;aw gathering in her countenance, and I therefore hurried into the hou&s;e: as no &s;ervants were in the long entry that led to the interior parts of the ta|vern, the jade had the &s;aucine&s;s to at|tack me through the key-hole, as I took &s;helter in an apartment that op|pened into the pa&s;&s;age; and in a voice, which I am &s;ure came from the bottom of her &s;oul, &s;he told me, I put her in mind of the brat, who &s;et a whole pari&s;h a little while ago, by the ears, about a &s;habby twenty pound that was left to poor folks, by Par&s;on Placid, his guardian.</P>
<P>The name of Placid, which was really that of my late excellent pro|tector,
<PB N="153" REF="172">immediately arrou&s;ed my at|tention; and, without any appre|hen&s;ion from the offended woman's pre&s;ent &s;tate of mind, I opened the door, and looking &s;teadfa&s;tly in her face, de&s;ired to know if &s;he had ever <HI>&s;een</HI> Mr. Placid? Seen him, (&s;aid &s;he) yes, I have &s;een him, for I lived at the market-town, three mile from the village where he did duty; and I heard my hu&s;band talk a good deal of that young fellow, who fell heir to the par&s;onage on Mini&s;ter Placid's death.</P>
<P>Why, <HI>who</HI> is your hu&s;band then, &s;aid I? Ah, fie upon him (&s;aid the woman) why, Gerrard Brown, the grocer of Gra&s;&s;ington, is my hu&s;band. And where is he now &s;aid I? He's a vile rogue be where he will, replied the beggar, and I will &s;ooner &s;tarve than
<PB N="154" REF="173">&s;ee his face again: a good-for-nothing fellow indeed; to go up to London, and &s;pend his &s;ub&s;tance, among a parcel of pro&s;titutes, and come down to his hone&s;t pains taking lawful wife in the country, by whom he has had lawful children, and give her the <HI>de|fection</HI> of bad di&s;orders. Oh Gerrard Brawn, Gerrard Brawn, what a villain you are. Have not I been from &s;un's ri&s;e to &s;un&s;et, behind the counter, dropping the good &s;ix-pences in the till, and &s;aving my farthing where|&s;oever I could nip it out of my &s;erv|ings, till you was a better man than any in town, and could &s;hew your face with the '&s;quire him&s;elf; and was all my care to be rewarded with a &mdash;, you dirty fellow: Oh Gerrard Brawn, Gerrard Brawn, what a villain you are!</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="174">The poor wretch, here wept bit|terly, and I was re&s;olved to know the particulars of a &s;tory that already be|came &s;o intere&s;ting, for I had heard enough to convince me that I was now in company with the wi&s;e of the very grocer, (of notorious memory,) whom I left brui&s;ed in bed at the inn, when I was coming to London. As Mrs. Brawn's appearance was not likely to gain admi&s;&s;ion into a tavern, I a&s;ked her, if &s;he could accompany me to any place where we might have half an hour's conver&s;ation; for that I believed I had once travelled with her hu&s;band, and was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee the wife, whom I remembered he prai&s;ed for her oeconomy, &s;o &s;oon reduced from a plentiful &s;ituation; and would do every thing in my power, to effect a reconciliation.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="175">Mrs. Brawn appeared &s;en&s;ible of my kindne&s;s, and, with many courte&s;ies, hopped away to a little public hou&s;e, at &s;ome di&s;tance, where &s;he told me her hi&s;tory; the heads of which were, that, "upon her hu&s;band's return into the country, he had communicated to her, a &s;marting in&s;tance of his in&s;i|delity; which, being di&s;covered, pro|duced an altercation that terminated in a dome&s;tic battle; the fruits of which, were a brui&s;ed leg, and a &s;epa|ration: for Mrs. Brawn, declared &s;he would die a thou&s;and deaths rather than have any farther concern with a man, who not only injured her virtuous &s;heets, (as &s;he called them,) but, who had beaten her into the bar|gain, and given her a <HI>defection,</HI> that &s;he believed would carry her to the grave. She farther informed me, that
<PB N="157" REF="176">if there was any excu&s;e to be made for the grocer, it was his having the mi&s;|fortune to find his daughter with child, upon his going to London, by a fellow not worth a groat; and that, &s;he did not know, but upon his per|ceiving this, it might turn his head, as it were, and make him go a&s;tray, to kill care: that, as to his daughter, he told the mantua-maker, to whom &s;he was bound 'prentice, he would have nothing more to &s;ay to her board or lodgings, and &s;o &s;he was turned out of doors; and as for Gerrard him&s;elf, &s;he knew nothing at all about him; and had rather continue to eat the coar&s;e and ca&s;ual bread of beg|gary, than hear, &s;ee, or have any thing more to do with him. She con|fe&s;&s;ed, moreover, that &s;he was in a de|plorable way, having no friends alive,
<PB N="158" REF="177">except her daughter, whom &s;he could by no means hear of; and therefore, &s;he was the more &s;orry I had given the poor woman, I &s;aw with her, a temptation to run away from her; add|ing, that, as they had been accu&s;|tomed to beg together, and divide their gettings very punctually &s;ince &s;he fir&s;t met with this a&s;&s;ociate in po|verty: it would be a lone&s;ome thing, to a&s;k for charity without a friend of any kind, either to tell her luck to, or to &s;ooth her in her many di&s;ap|pointments. However, &s;he a&s;ked my pardon for the ill-language &s;he had given me; and, (though &s;he &s;aid &s;he did not de&s;erve it) yet, if I could be good enough to &s;pare her a &s;mall matter, &s;he would limp about to the places where her companion had been u&s;ed to take her <HI>charity-&s;tands;</HI> and,
<PB N="159" REF="178">if &s;he found her, would endeavour to buy her company back again, with half my bounty.</P>
<P>This was really very affecting, and I gave, at once to her fidelity, and misfortunes, the tear of undi&s;|&s;embled pity.</P>
<P>Here, Mrs. Brawn, &s;aid I, make u&s;e of this &s;ilver, till I can do you a more e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice; and pray let me know, where I can &s;ee you to morrow morning.</P>
<P>She made the appointment at the hou&s;e &s;he then was; and after once more a&s;king forgivene&s;s for the abu&s;e &s;he had be&s;towed on me, limped away in &s;earch of her colleague.</P>

Did&s;t thou come up to the metropolis, in the pride of thy circum&s;tances, to &s;ee an only daughter, of who&s;e &s;obriety thou boa&s;ted, and did&s;t thou find her the victim of a villain? and ha&s;t thou lo&s;t the gainful partner of all thy thrifti|ne&s;s&mdash;&s;he, who &s;o well knew how to
<PB N="161" REF="180">turn the penny, while thou wert &s;moking the pipe of luxury in thy parlour? Perhaps thou art, by this time, <HI>thy&s;elf</HI> in the &s;ad condition of him, whom, on the journey, thou refu&s;ed&s;t to relieve, yea, ever &s;o lit|tle; or, it may be thou, art in a &s;itu|ation, &s;till <HI>more</HI> pitiable;&mdash;lamenting the ruin of a daughter, whom thy ra&s;hne&s;s hath made the more exqui|&s;itely unhappy, and the de&s;ertion of a partner, the old a&s;&s;i&s;tant of thy cares and joys, whom thy inconti|nence hath reduced to beggary. If that is the ca&s;e, thy fate is to be com|pa&s;&s;ionated, and I have a &s;orrow in my &s;ympathizing brea&s;t, even for thee.</P>
<P>This was one of tho&s;e theatrical &s;oliloquies I have already celebrated,
<PB N="162" REF="181">in which a man <HI>thinks</HI> as loud, as well-bred people choo&s;e at <HI>any time</HI> to &s;peak: &s;o that, what <HI>&s;hould</HI> have been <HI>a&s;ide,</HI> was very plainly heard by the landlady of this man&s;ion. On ri&s;ing to pay for the beer I had given to Mrs. Brawn, I beheld our ho&s;te&s;s with a pot in the one hand, and hold|ing up the corner of her apron to her eyes with the other, &s;tanding &s;till as a &s;tatue behind me: then perceiving I had done <HI>thinking,</HI> &s;he exclaimed with an audible voice, "The Lord have mercy upon me! I never heard any thing half &s;o moving, &s;ince I was able to turn the cock: the Lord have mercy upon us! 'tis as good as a <HI>&s;ermon.</HI></P>
<P>Upon laying down the money on the table, &s;he renewed her applau&s;es,
<PB N="163" REF="182">and with great vehemence, "wi&s;hed with all her &s;oul, that I had not two-pence in my pocket, nor a &s;hirt to my back, that &s;he might give me the price of the beer, and one of her hu&s;band Jeffery's &s;hirts (with <HI>frills</HI> to the bo&s;om) as a reward for my <HI>vartue</HI> and <HI>larning:</HI> both which, &s;he prote&s;ted, were dearer to her than the fle&s;h upon her bones." I paid her a compliment upon her love of <HI>vartue,</HI> returned thanks for her good wi&s;hes, and &s;et for|ward once more for the White Bear.</P>

<P>Without meeting any new preven|tative in my way, I at length took by the hand my friend Mr. Green; who, with his u&s;ual rapidity of ut|terance, told me, that by my &s;taying &s;o long, he &s;uppo&s;ed I had been mak|ing &s;ome of my benevolent blunders, and had given me over: but, come my dear boy, added he, &s;it down, and make your&s;elf merry: I am a thou&s;and-pound man: I have turned up trumps: the game's my own, and lookee, lookee, my lad of a thou|&s;and, here here I have the honours in my hand: you mu&s;t under&s;tand, that I have been within four per|pendiculars&mdash;four
<PB N="165" REF="184">bricks walls&mdash;my dear youth, &s;ince our adventure of the eating hou&s;e; but&mdash;whew&mdash;what of that? a &s;nap of a nut for misfor|tune: I <HI>played</HI> out; I got my liberty, by general con&s;ent of all their pa&s;te|board maje&s;ties: a pair-royal of kings fanctified my freedom. You mu&s;t know, a rich ra&s;cal, who made a break of it, came into jail to &s;hew his poverty and hone&s;ty: I know the fellow, when he flouri&s;hed like a fig|tree; marked him down, &s;oon found that the thing was a &s;ure lay, and now my boy, he is (by Heaven's, and <HI>my</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;tance) as pennile&s;s as he ought to have been before he &s;neaked into pri&s;on. Odd&s;bobs that's true, &mdash;he mu&s;t not &s;tarve neither&mdash;here waiter, pray pull the bell.&mdash;Here,
<PB N="166" REF="185">waiter, carry this guinea to Fleet-pri|&s;on, to one Doublecrack, with the compliments of Alexander Green, e&s;q. But I beg a thou&s;and pardons: my joy makes me as bungling as your|&s;elf, Benignus&mdash;give me your hand&mdash; Pray gentlemen, know the prince of &s;implicity, and the pink of liberality&mdash; this is, Benignus, the promi&s;ing lad you heard me mention&mdash;Pray Niggy, know my friends: this is Jack Blake&mdash;this Jerry Smack&mdash;there, there, &mdash;now is it over&mdash;now you are old friends&mdash;Come forth then long pur&s;e, and to a laudable purpo&s;e&mdash;to en|tertain four of the worthie&s;t fel|lows, perhaps that ever de&s;pi&s;ed a guinea.</P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t opportunity either I, or any body el&s;e had, to
<PB N="167" REF="186">open our lips; for Green not only engro&s;&s;ed the conver&s;ation, but gave me &s;o often the &s;queeze of wel|come, and led me &s;o heartily through the ceremonies of introduction, that I could only humour his motions, as fa&s;t as my legs could carry me, and how to the company as frequently as he thought proper to anounce me to them; &s;ometimes under the name of Niggy, &s;ometimes as his Pink of Li|berality; and &s;ometimes as his Lad of a Thou&s;and.</P>
<P>The appearance of dinner (the pro|fu&s;ion of which, be&s;poke the &s;ituation of the gam&s;ter's pocket) put a &s;hort period to the eloquence of this &s;trange mortal, who was &s;o truly elevated by the pre&s;ent flu&s;hings of his pro&s;perity, that he &s;aid, and did, a thou&s;and
<PB N="168" REF="187">things, which in a calmer &s;tate of mind than I then enjoyed, might have in&s;pired merriment; and which, even as it was, protected me from melan|choly. He de&s;ired to know how many my Benevolence had &s;aved from the kennel? how many it had promoted from the kitchen to the parlour? who I had re&s;cued from the ditch; and how many harpies I had permit|ted to put their hands into my breeches pocket?</P>
<P>I venerate the gentleman's &s;pirit and &s;en&s;ibility (&s;aid Blake, whom I now di&s;covered to be the per&s;on that I had thra&s;hed with the hammer, which, as pre&s;ident, he commanded) I have, before to-day, &s;een an evi|dence of the goodne&s;s of his heart; and though we have exchanged a
<PB N="169" REF="188">word or two more than is agreeable, I dare &s;ay we &s;hall henceforward agree perfectly together, upon all good-natured occa&s;ions <HI>nem. con.</HI></P>
<P>We now &s;hook hands, in te&s;ti|mony of total forgivene&s;s, and forget|fulne&s;s, of every thing that happened at the &s;ociety of &s;y&s;tems: and then Green drank a gla&s;s to our better ac|quaintance; declared that he loved us both better than his pur&s;e &s;trings, and that, as far as his thou&s;and pound would go, he was at our &s;er|vice.</P>

<P>Dinner being over, Mr Green &s;aid it was always a rule with him to drink
<PB N="170" REF="189">the founder of the fea&s;t; and there|fore, &s;aid he, (pouring out &s;ome wine into all the gla&s;&s;es) here's Mr. Deve|reux Doublecrack. This ceremony over, Mr. Blake a&s;ked me what I thought of the &s;peakers of the &s;o|ciety? D&mdash;n &s;ocieties, &s;aid Green; it is impo&s;&s;ible for a man to talk of &s;ocieties, till he is a little <HI>elucidated</HI> by the juice of the grape: for my part, I can never argue till I am happy, and I never am happy without the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of this &s;ame ro&s;y-coloured deity Bacchus. Come, about with it, my ca&s;h actually weighs me down: in pity help me to <HI>liquify</HI> &s;ome of it, dear lads.
<Q><L>Bacchus ever fair and young,</L>
<L>Drinking joys did fir&s;t ordain;</L>
<L><PB N="171" REF="190">
Bacchus' ble&s;&s;ings are a trea&s;ure,</L>
<L>Drinking is&mdash;</L></Q> Come, here's John Dryden's health&mdash; here's to the memory of the everla&s;ting John Dryden.</P>
<P>Never &s;aw I any creature &s;o little able to &s;upport good luck, and a happy hand of cards, as this Alexan|der Green: his hilarity became more and more animated every minute: he &s;ung catches; he &s;truck me in the violence of his friendly profe&s;&s;ions, many times upon, fir&s;t the &s;houlder, then the thigh; &s;wore at the &s;ame time, that I was a lad of a thou&s;and; that I &s;hould not leave him till his pur&s;e was as light as eleven pence: he affected to dete&s;t every thing but Champaigne; and at la&s;t grew &s;o out|rageou&s;ly
<PB N="172" REF="191">kind, frolic&s;ome and funny, that he leapt up and mounted the table, in&s;i&s;ted that we &s;hould all do the &s;ame, and drink out of our hats by general con&s;ent.</P>
<P>The&s;e fallies of delirious joy la&s;ted for near two hours, at the end of which, Green had really exhau&s;ted his &s;pirits, till he fairly <Q>yawned at alteration,</Q> and fell a&s;leep in his chair.</P>
<P>And now, Me&s;&s;rs. Blake and Smack began to &s;hew off, particularly the latter; who, under&s;tanding that I had a country-hou&s;e, and a garden now in full bloom, was led into his fa|vourite train of conver&s;ation, which was what he called, "rural felicity;" and, after wi&s;hing that he was <HI>out of trade,</HI> that he could live for ever
<PB N="173" REF="192">among&s;t the "ro&s;es and po&s;es," thus began.</P>
<P>"Oh Heavens, Benignus! and have you left &s;o &s;weet a part of the country, at this time of the year too, for this vile pe&s;tilent congregation of vapours, the city of London? Why, &s;ir, I would give half what I am worth in the world, to live in &s;uch a retreat as yours. I am the mo&s;t mi&s;erable lump of money that ever exi&s;ted; for, as I always &s;ay, and as all other wi&s;e men have &s;aid before me, what are riches without health? When I came fir&s;t from Hull in York&s;hire, to this town, I was quite another &s;ort of a thing to what I am now&mdash;quite a dif|ferent per&s;on, as ma&s;ter Green that's now a&s;leep very well knows: my eyes were black, my forehead was
<PB N="174" REF="193">white, my cheeks were red, my hair was brown; and, in &s;hort, I was within an ace, of what you might call a hand&s;ome man. And yet, Mr. Benignus, pray look at me now&mdash; quite changed you &s;ee:&mdash;an ab&s;olute <HI>metamorpho&s;ie,</HI> as the poet has it&mdash;quite altered my friend. I am even "like Patience near the Monument (for I live in Laurence-lane), &s;miling at Grief." But no matter for that, I &s;hall bring it about yet; for you mu&s;t know, I intend to take a bit of a box in the country towards Kennington, which Mr. Launcelot Squib, my apo|thecary &s;ays, is the very heath of health. Yes Benignus, and there I mean to live among&s;t the <HI>&s;alutiferarious</HI> gales of rural life, as the poet has it: I ha'n't time for &s;uch journeys on
<PB N="175" REF="194">working days, but if you have a mind, I'll take a trip with you there next Sunday, along with my friend Blake, who has a &s;nug little piece of pro|perty there him&s;elf; have you not, Mr. Blake?</P>
<P>Before Mr. Blake had time to reply, Mr Smack proceeded to enquire into the ta&s;te of my "rural felicity;" whether I admired quick-&s;ets or box|hedges, or the humours of the yew|tree? Whether I was for ever-greens, or <HI>monthlys?</HI> and whether I cho&s;e naturals or artificials; the open air, or hot beds?"</P>
<P>When I told Mr. Smack, that I valued my&s;elf chiefly upon an excel|lent fi&s;h-pond, that was in the centre of my garden, he cried out in a tone of envy: "Ah Benignus! what a
<PB N="176" REF="195">happy man you ought to be; and yet you mu&s;t be mi&s;erable too, for otherwi&s;e you never could think of &s;tewing your&s;elf up in this dungeon of darkne&s;s, now
<Q><L>The lark begins to &s;ing,</L>
<L>And linets take the wing;</L></Q> as the poet &s;ays. If I was in your place, I would take the cold bath every morning, till I clean and cleverly brought round my complexion: the cold bath, &s;ir, is <HI>per&s;cribed</HI> by all your <HI>phizycians</HI> here, without exception, un|le&s;s in particular ca&s;es: it is a bracer of the &s;olids; it will wind you up as tight as a drum: why, even at my little hole in Laurence-lane, what do you think I do? why, I make my &s;er|vant pump me four pails-full of water
<PB N="177" REF="196">every morning, and &s;et it in the cellar, into which, as &s;oon as ever I am up, I &s;ou&s;e head over heels, and &s;o brace my &s;olids in a brewing tub.</P>
<P>And pray, do you find any re|lief from this immer&s;ion, &s;aid I, Mr. Smack?</P>
<P>Why, I think I do, (he replied with great gravity) I think I do; I cer|tainly am not &s;o yellow as I was: it is not like a pond, or a river, or a ditch, or a regular bath, to be &s;ure; <HI>Ars not e&s;t natural,</HI> as the poet &s;ays. But its a rea&s;onable good make-&s;hift too. While you &s;tay in town, Benignus, (if you come &s;o far) I beg you will u&s;e me like a friend, and dive in my ve&s;&s;el as often as you like.</P>
<P>Here he looked me full in the face, and &s;haking his head, as if he did not
<PB N="178" REF="197">like the pro&s;pect, a&s;&s;ured me that I was going very fa&s;t. You begin to change, &s;aid he, I can tell you that: your cheek is upon the turn: I &s;ee the claw of the crow, as the poet &s;ays, under your eye: aye, aye, here it is, pre&s;&s;ing upon the pupil, as yel|low as a <HI>colly-flower.</HI> If you have any regard for your complexion, dip im|mediately; dip my dear friend, and keep your&s;elf out of the jaundice; or el&s;e, as the poet &s;ays, you'll be ju&s;t like the lady, who
<Q><L>Never told her love,</L>
<L>But grew <HI>green</HI> and <HI>yellow</HI> with melancholy,</L>
<L>Tho' &s;he was before red as the dama&s;k ro&s;e.</L></Q> All this time, Green was repairing his &s;pirits, and Mr. Blake, who had drank pretty freely, was li&s;tening to
<PB N="179" REF="198">the &s;tory of "rural felicity," with his eyes half-clo&s;ed, and his head leaning in his hand. Mr. Smack now ad|verted to the affair of the fi&s;h-pond; and after particular inquiries as to its <HI>weadth</HI> and <HI>breadth,</HI> a&s;ked me, whe|ther it was a pond merely for u&s;e, or ornament, and in &s;hort, what <HI>it was about?</HI></P>
<P><HI>About?</HI> &s;aid I.</P>
<P>Aye, about, rejoined Smack; I mean, is it like our ponds in and about town; or is it only a downright country puddle, without either ge|nius or entertainment?</P>
<P>I don't under&s;tand you Mr. Smack.</P>
<P>Dont you? cried Smack; to &s;peak plain then, as the poet &s;ays, what conceits and fancies does it exhibit? Is there not a figure playing off a fountain? Is there not a little chubby|cheeked
<PB N="180" REF="199">fellow p&mdash;f&mdash;g pure water? Is there any pipes and plea&s;ure en|gines? Can you &s;prinkle your vi&s;itors all over, and wet them to the &s;kin without warning? Hey?</P>
<P>No, indeed, &s;aid I.</P>
<P>No, he replied, I thought &s;o; I thought you was too far from Lon|don for that: there, it mu&s;t be owned we have the advantage of you! we can make the water play all manner of tricks.</P>
<P>Indeed! &s;aid I.</P>
<P>Oh &s;ir, cried Smack, our improve|ments are amazing and <HI>perdigus,</HI> in this re&s;pect. Some of your <HI>littereaty,</HI> really think we now have got as far as we can go in this particular: why, we can make the water ri&s;e, and roar like a &s;ky-rocket; we can make our images ca&s;cade from every part of the
<PB N="181" REF="200">human body: then, &s;ir, our figures are finely done, admirably executed: the Venu&s;&s;es, the Graces, and the <HI>Maidoners,</HI> as the poet &s;ays, are enough to make a man jump out of his &s;kin: all ju&s;t like nature, &s;ir; all naked:&mdash;there's the face, and the arms, and the &s;houlders, and the&mdash; what not&mdash;for all the world, as if it was the thing it&s;elf&mdash;aye, as if it was the very <HI>moral</HI> of the woman&mdash;there, you &s;ee all for nothing, as the poet &s;ays: they are all fronting the road, with their faces turned to entertain the pa&s;&s;engers, and their b&mdash;k&mdash;d&mdash;s to the family!&mdash;Oh Mr. Benignus, <HI>ta&s;te</HI> is come to a <HI>mon&s;trous</HI> pitch indeed!</P>
<P>By this time, Mr. Green began to open his eyes, after the refre&s;hment of his panacea; and, without mak|ing any &s;ort of apology, for having
<PB N="182" REF="201">been caught napping, pu&s;hed about the bottle with renovated vigour; and &s;aid, that <HI>he</HI> who fir&s;t refu&s;ed his gla&s;s, &s;hould be puni&s;hed with a pair of challengers: even you, Benignus, &s;aid he, mu&s;t for once play the rake; for I am a thou&s;and pound man, and if you don't get elevated beyond all the cares of this world, upon the oc|ca&s;ion, I &s;hall think you envy my good fortune, and have not a &s;pice of benevolence in your nature: try for once, my dear boy, what a &s;toop of good liquor will do. I am afraid, Benignus, you are too &s;ober a man for felicity. Od&s;bobs my friend, one may &s;tarve happine&s;s by bad living; and take my word for it, if a man is in good circum&s;tances, Champaigne will make him &s;till better; and if he is in a poor, di&s;pirited way, a chear|ful
<PB N="183" REF="202">gla&s;s will &s;et his heart a dancing, and his head will be too light for the leaden weight of calamity.</P>
<P>Some how or another, Green chat|ted me into tolerable &s;pirits, and I drank more than enough to make <HI>me</HI> (who was not u&s;ed to &s;uch freedoms) particularly talkative.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e di&s;&s;ipations, Mr. Blake propo&s;ed, as it was a fine evening, that we &s;hould take a hack|ney-coach, and cool our&s;elves with a ride, and a comfortable di&s;h of tea, at his cottage at Kennington. This propo&s;al was no &s;ooner made, than it was agreed to, and we &s;et off imme|diately, after <HI>clearing decks,</HI> as Green termed it. Accur&s;ed is he who &s;pill|eth his liquor, &s;aid this rattle of a character: not the fiftieth part of a drop mu&s;t be left upon the table.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="203">At the co&s;t of &s;ome &s;evere drink|ing, the decks were cleared, and the bill introduced; to which, when I offered to contribute my &s;hare, Green caught hold of my hand, and ex|claimed&mdash;Fie on't, Benignus, what are you going to do? Am not I a thou&s;and pound man; and did not <HI>you</HI> treat la&s;t? not a creature pre&s;ent pays a farthing of <HI>this</HI> but my&s;elf! So &s;aying, he rang lu&s;tily for the waiter, to whom he gave half a crown as a compliment; paid the amount of the bill, without examining the particu|lars, hung upon my arm as he &s;taggered to the coach, and bid the coachman drive to Kennington-com|mon like a devil.</P>
