<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THESE Two Volumes are compo&s;ed from the XIVth and XVth of my OUTLINES OF THE GLOBE. I had many &s;olicitations from private friends, and a few wi&s;hes from per&s;ons unknown delivered in the public prints, to commit to the pre&s;s a part, in the form in which the po&s;t|humous volumes might hereafter make their appearance. I might have pleaded the imprudence of the attempt, at my time of life, of beginning &s;o arduous an undertaking in my 71&s;t year. I happily, till very lately, had &s;carcely any ad|monition of the advanced &s;ea&s;on. I plunged into the &s;ea of troubles, and with my papers in one hand, made my way through the waves with the other, and brought them &s;ecure to land. This, alas! is &s;enile boa&s;ting. I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the judgment of the public, and learn from thence how far I am to be cen&s;ured for &s;o grievous an offence again&s;t the maxim of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> who fixes the decline of human abili|ties to the 49th year. I ought to &s;hudder when I con&s;ider
<PB N="ii" REF="5">the wear and tare of twenty-two years; and I feel &s;hocked at the remark of the elegant <HI>Delaney,</HI> who ob&s;erves,
<Q>that it is generally agreed among wi&s;e men, that few great attempts, at le&s;t in the learned way, have ever been wi&s;ely undertaken and happily executed after that period!</Q> I cannot defend the wi&s;dom: yet, from the good fortune of my life, I will attempt the execution.</P>
<P>It will be formed upon the model of my INTRODUCTION to the ARCTIC ZOOLOGY, imitating, as far as my talents will admit, the great examples left by the di&s;ciples of the LIN|NAEAN &s;chool, and the &s;olid writings of the liberal and com|municative race of the <HI>hyperborean</HI> learned, fitted by cli|mate to a&s;&s;iduous &s;tudy, and to retain the immen&s;ene&s;s of their knowlege, when acquired. The Torrid Zone gene|rally enervates the body and mind. The divine particle melts away, and every idea is too often lo&s;t in irre&s;i&s;tible indolence.</P>
<P>Yet there are two writers, to whom I mu&s;t own the highe&s;t obligations, who felt no degeneracy by the influence of climate. Their thoughts are as firm and collected as if they had been braced by the &s;teady fro&s;t of the north.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is <HI>James Rennel</HI> E&s;quire, late Major of Engi|neers and Surveyor General in <HI>Bengal.</HI> The effects of his
<PB N="iii" REF="6">labors, more immediately applied to the national &s;ervice, have been productive of others, which have proved the brighte&s;t elucidations of a country, till after the year 1757, little more than the object of conque&s;t, and now and then,&mdash; rarely indeed, of &s;ordid adventure. Mr. <HI>Rennel</HI>'s Map of <HI>Hindoo&s;tan,</HI> or the <HI>Mogul</HI> Empire, and the attendant Me|moir, are unparalleled convictions of the accuracy of the author in the &s;tudy of geography, in which no rival dare di&s;pute the palm of merit. I cannot expre&s;s the obligations my pre&s;ent Work is under to his labors. I under&s;tand that there is another of the &s;ame nature, but far more exten&s;ive&mdash; perhaps in the pre&s;s&mdash;every &s;ucce&s;s attend the labors of his pen.</P>
<Q><L>I pede fau&s;to,</L>
<L>Grandia laturus meritorum praemia&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>The other writer I allude to is the celebrated Sir WIL|LIAM JONES. The &s;ubjects of that true genius were fa|vored by APOLLO him&s;elf, being as &s;ublime and elegant as tho&s;e over which that deity peculiarly pre&s;ided. The SUN, who&s;e character might melt away the powers of feeble Genii, &s;erved only to exalt his &s;trength of mind, as its beams are feigned to give additional brilliancy to the diamond in its mine. The reader will not wonder that
<PB N="iv" REF="7">I make him &s;o nearly the <HI>Alpha</HI> and <HI>Omega</HI> of this my labor. The various pen of my illu&s;trious countryman ex|celled in every &s;cience. <HI>Phoebus</HI> &s;miled on all his un|dertakings, and he was &s;aluted by the whole circle at|tendant on the deity, as <HI>Gallus</HI> is &s;aid to have been of old: &mdash;A truer &s;imile cannot be adduced.</P>
<Q>Utque vero PHOEBI Chorus &s;urrexerit omnis!</Q>
<P>I mu&s;t not be &s;ilent in re&s;pect to the labors of an|other gentleman, who, notwith&s;tanding he never vi&s;ited <HI>Hindoo&s;tan,</HI> has written with uncommon &s;ucce&s;s on the wonderful mythology of the <HI>Hindoo</HI> religion, derived mo&s;t happily the &s;ources of many of its my&s;teries, and traced their origins, nearly lo&s;t in the mi&s;ts of fable, from the &s;acred purity of HOLY WRIT. He has done the &s;ame by numbers of the ab&s;tru&s;e&s;t antiquities of the works of art; and that with a depth of learning and per&s;picuity rarely to be met with. But, alas! no CHOIR ri&s;es to &s;alute the Re|verend <HI>Thomas Maurice.</HI> This learned divine bends under the weight of <HI>hone&s;ta pauperies.</HI> That &s;till voice which hurt-merit and con&s;cious mode&s;ty cannot always &s;uppre&s;s, is often drowned in the clamors of the undaunted throng, &s;o as never to emerge into the notice of tho&s;e who&s;e
<PB N="v" REF="8">peculiar duty it is to &s;earch deeply into characters, be they in courts or choirs, and to put to flight the <HI>ignavum pecus,</HI> which are too frequently the pe&s;ts of both,
<Q><L>Who, for their bellies &s;ake,</L>
<L>Creep and intrude, and climb into the fold.</L>
<L>Of other care they little reck'ning make,</L>
<L>Than how to &s;cramble at the &s;hearers fea&s;t,</L>
<L>And &s;hove away the worthy bidden gue&s;t!</L></Q></P>

<P>A YOGEY, or penitential <HI>Faquir.</HI> The&s;e cla&s;&s;es devote them&s;elves to varieties of mo&s;t cruel au&s;terities. <HI>Tavernier,</HI> at p. 166 of his travels in <HI>India,</HI> gives a plate of the various penances they inflict on them|&s;elves.

The dangers which might occur in an unknown &s;ea, and the pre&s;&s;ing in&s;tances made by his friends, induced him to return. He landed his forces, and took the rout towards <HI>Gedro&s;ia,</HI> and at length arrived at the city of <HI>Baby|len,</HI> with the remains of his faithful army, reduced by the toil|&s;ome march, by famine, pe&s;tilence, and every calamity which his phrenetic ambition had involved it in.</P>

<P>I MENTION here the impo&s;thume of the liver,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">LIVER DISEASE.</NOTE> not as a local di&s;ea&s;e, but on account of a peculiar &s;uper&s;tition pre&s;erved in this country, the <HI>Sircar of Tatta,</HI> re&s;pecting the di&s;order. The real cau&s;e, &s;ays <HI>Bontius,</HI> p. 30. <HI>Engl.</HI> edit. ari&s;es from intem|perance; an impo&s;thume is often formed in that part, and on opening it after death it is often found eaten, or honey-combed. The &s;ide is not unfrequently laid open to get at the part infected: The impo&s;tume is cut, and the liver clean&s;ed. I have heard, from the credulous, &s;trange &s;tories on this head. The <HI>Indians</HI> of the <HI>Sircar</HI> firmly believe, that the di&s;ea&s;e is inflicted by a &s;et of &s;orcerers, called <HI>Jiggerkhars,</HI> or liver eaters.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">JIGGERKHARS.</NOTE>
<Q>One of this cla&s;s,</Q> &s;ays the <HI>Ayeen Akberry,</HI> ii. p. 144,
<Q>can &s;teal away the liver of another by looks and incantations. Other accounts &s;ay, that by looking at a per&s;on he deprives him of his &s;en&s;es, and then &s;teals from him &s;omething re&s;embling
<PB N="34" REF="50">the &s;eed of a pomegranate, and which he hides in the calf of his leg.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE <HI>Jiggerkhar</HI> throws on the fire the grain before de&s;cribed, which thereupon &s;preads to the &s;ize of a di&s;h, and he di&s;tributes it among&s;t his fellows to be eaten, which ceremony concludes the life of the fa&s;cinated per&s;on. A <HI>Jig|gerkhar</HI> is able to communicate his art to another, and which he does by learning him the incantations, and by making him eat a bit of the liver cake. If any one cut open the calf of the magician's leg, extract the grain, and give it to the afflicted per&s;on to eat, he immediately recovers. The&s;e <HI>Jiggerkhars</HI> are mo&s;tly women. It is &s;aid, moreover, that they can bring intelligence from a great di&s;tance in a &s;hort &s;pace of time, and if they are thrown into a river with a &s;tone tied to them, they neverthele&s;s will not &s;ink. In order to deprive any one of this wicked power, they brand his temples, and every joint in his body; cram his eyes with &s;alt, &s;u&s;pend him for forty days in a &s;ubterraneous cavern, and repeat over him certain incantations. In this &s;tate he is called <HI>Detcherch.</HI> Although, after having undergone this di&s;cipline, he is not able to de&s;troy the liver of any one, yet he retains the power of being able to di&s;cover another <HI>Jiggerkhar,</HI> and is u&s;ed for detecting tho&s;e di&s;turbers of mankind.

The <HI>Ca&s;hmerians</HI> engro&s;s this article, and have factors in all parts of <HI>Thibet</HI> for buying up the wool, which is &s;ent into <HI>Ca&s;hmere,</HI> and worked into <HI>&s;hawls,</HI> &s;uperior in elegance to tho&s;e woven even from the fleeces of their own country. This ma|nufacture is a con&s;iderable &s;ource of wealth. <HI>Bernier</HI> relates, that in his days, <HI>&s;hawls</HI> made expre&s;sly for the great <HI>Omrahs,</HI> of the <HI>Thibetian</HI> wool, co&s;t a hundred and fifty <HI>roupees,</HI> whereas tho&s;e made of the wool of the country never co&s;t more than fifty.</P>
<P><HI>Akbar</HI> was a mo&s;t particular encourager of the manufacture.

The mo&s;t curious thing I &s;aw in this place, was certain little mice, who, being found orphans without fire or dam to tend them, were put into this ho&s;pi|tal, and a venerable old man with a white beard, keeping them in a box among&s;t cotton, very diligently tended them, with his &s;pectacles on his no&s;e, giving them milk to eat with a bird's feather, becau&s;e they were &s;o little that as yet they could eat nothing el&s;e; and, as he told us, he intended when they were grown up to let them go free whither they plea&s;ed.</Q></P>

In another place, far from hence, we &s;aw another ho&s;pital of cows and calves, &s;ome whereof had broken legs, others, more infirm, very old or lean, and therefore were kept here to be cured. Among the bea&s;ts there was al&s;o a <HI>Mahometan</HI> thief, who, having been taken in theft, had both his hands cut off; but the compa&s;&s;ionate Gentiles, that he might not peri&s;h mi&s;erably, now he was no longer able to get his living, took him into this place, and kept him among the poor bea&s;ts, not &s;uffering him to want any thing. Moreover, without one of the gates of the city, we &s;aw another great troop of cows, calves, and goats, which being cured and brought into better plight, or gathered together from being di&s;per&s;ed, and with|out ma&s;ters, or being redeemed with money from the <HI>Mahome|tans,</HI> who would have killed them to eat, (namely, the goats and other animals, but not the cows and calves) were &s;ent into the field to feed by neat-herds, purpo&s;ely maintained at the public charge; and thus they are kept, till, being re|duced to perfect health, 'tis found fitting to give them to &s;ome citizens or others, who may charitably keep them. I excepted cows and calves from the animals redeemed from &s;laughter; becau&s;e in <HI>Cambaia,</HI> cows, calves, and oxen are not killed by any; and there is a great prohibition again&s;t it, by the in&s;tance of the Gentiles, who upon this account pay a great &s;um of money to the prince; and &s;hould any, either

The words of that very in|telligent writer Mr. <HI>Rennel,</HI> will be&s;t convey the idea of the importance of this invaluable tree.</P>
<P><Q>I CANNOT clo&s;e this account without remarking the unpar|donable negligence we are guilty of, in delaying to build teek &s;hips of war for the u&s;e of the <HI>Indian</HI> &s;eas. They might be freighted home, without the ceremony of regular equipment, as to ma&s;ts, &s;ails, and furniture, which might be calculated ju&s;t to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of the home pa&s;&s;age at the be&s;t &s;ea&s;on; and crews could be provided in <HI>India.</HI> The letter an|nexed, which was written with the be&s;t intentions, nine or ten years ago, will explain the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">VAST DURA|TION.</NOTE> Teek &s;hips of forty years old and upwards, are no uncommon objects in the <HI>Indian</HI> &s;eas; while an <HI>European</HI> built &s;hip is ruined there in five years. The &s;hips built at <HI>Bombay</HI> are the
<PB N="82" REF="100">be&s;t, both in point of work man&s;hip and materials, of any that are con&s;tructed in <HI>India:</HI> and although fourth rates only are mentioned in the letter, there is no doubt but that third rates may be con&s;tructed, as there is a choice of timber. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> build capital &s;hips in their foreign &s;ettlements. The <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company have a teek &s;hip on her fourth voyage at pre&s;ent, which &s;hip has wintered in <HI>England,</HI> therefore any objection founded on the effects of fro&s;t on the teek timber, is done away.</Q></P>
<P><Q>FREQUENT have been the opportunities I have had of ob|&s;erving how very rapid the decay of &s;hips built of <HI>European</HI> timber is in the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies;</HI> and, on the contrary, how du|rable the &s;hips are, that are built of the wood of that country; namely, the teek, which may not improperly be &s;tyled <HI>In|dian</HI> oak. The number of &s;hips of war that were ruined in tho&s;e &s;eas during the late war (1757 to 1762) may be admitted as a proof of the former remark; and the great age of the &s;hips built in <HI>India</HI> may &s;erve to prove the latter. What I mean to infer from this, for your Lord&s;hip's u&s;e is, that &s;hips of war under third rates may be con&s;tructed in <HI>India,</HI> and with mo|derate repairs la&s;t for ages; whereas a &s;hip of <HI>European</HI> con|&s;truction can remain there but a very few years; to which di&s;|advantage may be added, that of lo&s;ing, in the mean time, the &s;ervices of the &s;hips that are &s;ent to relieve the worn out ones.</Q></P>

At each angle it is divided into three &s;mall &s;quare rooms; and at one of the entrances within (for there are three) is another, all, perhaps, chapels. The&s;e are expre&s;&s;ed in Mr. <HI>Pyke</HI>'s plan.</P>
<P>IN every cave, de&s;cribed by the&s;e curious travellers, are mo&s;t amazing numbers of &s;culptures, all cut out of the live rock, of human figures, extravagant deities, mon&s;ters, animals, foliage, and all that can a&s;toni&s;h and bewilder the imagination. Many repre&s;ent idols of the <HI>Indian</HI> mythology, figures half bea&s;t and half man; many faces and many hands to the &s;ame &s;culpture;
<PB N="98" REF="117">and often the <HI>Cobra de Capello,</HI> that dreadful &s;nake, which is attendant on &s;everal of the incarnations of <HI>Vi&s;tchenou.</HI> A fi&s;h is one, which a&s;&s;i&s;ts to explain the object of the &s;culptures and u&s;es of the excavations.</P>
<P>THESE caverns are the haunts of mon&s;trous &s;erpents. <HI>Hamil|ton,</HI> i. 239, tells us, that on firing his fu&s;il, to enjoy the thunder|ing echo of the report, he di&s;turbed a <HI>Boa,</HI> fifteen feet in length, and two feet in girth, from its antient &s;eat, which put the tra|veller to &s;peedy flight, and an end to his curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>MOST of the figures are colo&s;&s;al, from twelve to twenty-three feet high. Some of them, with all their extravagancies, are &s;aid to be finely executed: many are cro&s;s leg'd, in their attitude of prayer; many have ro&s;aries, which prove that the&s;e places were objects of devotion.</P>
<P>THE woman with three faces and four arms is engraven in Mr. <HI>Pyke</HI>'s account. I beg leave to make a few remarks on that figure: round her neck are five necklaces, rich in pearls and gems, with pendent jewels; her hair is long, and hangs in beautiful ringlets; her ears (not her ear-rings as they are called) hang to a va&s;t length, exactly in the <HI>Malabar</HI> mode; and her head|dre&s;s is conic, in the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> fa&s;hion, which might have been in u&s;e in early times. The la&s;t is dropt; the &s;trange deformity of long ears are &s;till retained: &s;o far is certainly of ea&s;tern &s;culpture.</P>
<P>BUT what can be &s;aid to the figures found in another cave, in the neighborhood of <HI>Bombay,</HI> not expre&s;&s;ed by name: they are engraven in volume vii. of the <HI>Archaelogia;</HI> &s;ome have the &s;au&s;age curl, others the cochlear twirl, in the hair, and others
<PB N="99" REF="118">the rich braid of pearl; all re&s;embling, in &s;ome degree, the fanta&s;tic variety in the head-dre&s;&s;es of the <HI>Roman</HI> ladies, with|out the le&s;t trace of <HI>oriental</HI> fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude with &s;aying, that the cave of <HI>Elephanta</HI> takes its name from an elephant, with a le&s;&s;er on its back, cut on the out&s;ide of the cave; and in a pa&s;&s;age is the rude figure of a hor&s;e, called that of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, to whom the <HI>Indians</HI> attribute the&s;e mighty works, as we <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> do every thing &s;tu|pendous to our favorite <HI>Arthur.</HI> I mention this tradition to &s;hew its great antiquity, as well as that of the excavations them|&s;elves. <HI>Arrian,</HI> in his <HI>Periplus maris Erythraei,</HI> ii. 166, &s;ays that there were near <HI>Barygaza,</HI> foundations of camps, antient cha|pels, altars, and <GAP DESC="foreign">, great wells, all attributed to the <HI>Macedonian</HI> hero.</P>
<P>THE idols mentioned here are quite diminutive to &s;ome in the <HI>Soobah&s;hip</HI> of <HI>Ca&s;hmere,</HI> in rece&s;&s;es excavated in the moun|tain, which are called (&s;ays the <HI>Ayeen,</HI> ii. 208) <HI>Surnmii,</HI> and are pre|tended to have been the winter retreat of the antient inhabitants; one of the figures was eighty ells high; there was a woman of fifty, and a child of fifteen. In one of the&s;e <HI>Surnmii</HI> was found a tomb, and in that a coffin; in which was a corp&s;e pre&s;erved by medical preparations: one would &s;uppo&s;e that the cu&s;toms of the <HI>Tartars</HI> had been ob&s;erved in this place, and burning the bodies at that time not in u&s;e.</P>
<P>THE method of travelling which begins at <HI>Surat,</HI>

Whenever they get to the end of the journey, the driver always alights, and puts the near bullock in the other's place; then he puts his hand into both their mouths, and after pulling out the froth, mounts his box again and drives back. It &s;eems this precaution is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, for as they travel at the rate of &s;even or eight miles an hour, they would otherwi&s;e be in danger of &s;uffocation.</P>

<P>SOME few other things, re&s;pecting the natural hi&s;tory of <HI>Bombay</HI> and its neighborhood, may be here taken notice of. The di&s;ea&s;es of <HI>India</HI> begin to &s;hew them&s;elves in this place,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BARBIERS, A DISEASE.</NOTE> but I &s;hall only attend to the <HI>Barbiers,</HI> which is more prevalent on this &s;ide of the penin&s;ula of <HI>India</HI> than the other. It is a pal&s;y, which takes its name from <HI>Beriberii,</HI> or the &s;heep, as the afflicted totter in their gait like that animal when &s;eized with a giddine&s;s. Its &s;ymptoms are both a numbne&s;s, a privation of the u&s;e of the limbs, a tremor, and an attendant titillation u&s;ually not fatal, but extremely difficult of cure. It comes on &s;lowly, and u&s;ually in the rainy &s;ea&s;on; but if a per&s;on drinks ha&s;tily, when heated, a large draught of <HI>Toddy,</HI> or the liquor of the coco nut, the attack of the di&s;ea&s;e is very &s;udden. <HI>Bontius, (Engli&s;h</HI> edition, p. 1), treats largely of the cure.

<PB N="103" REF="122">and they make a common di&s;h at the tables. Many are the modes of accounting for this annual appearance. It has been &s;ugge&s;ted that the &s;pawn may have been brought by the water fowl, or may have been caught up by the <HI>Typhons,</HI> which rage at the commencement of the wet &s;ea&s;on, and be conveyed in the torrents of rain. I can only give an explanation much le&s;s violent: That the&s;e fi&s;hes never had been any where but near the places where they are found. That they have had a pre|exi&s;tent &s;tate, and began life in form of frogs; that it had been the <HI>Rana paradoxa</HI> of <HI>Gm. Lin.</HI> iii. p. 10. 55.

No wonder then that <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;hould notice them in his time as committing depredations on the <HI>Roman Ea&s;t India</HI> trade; and although a temporary check has been given them in the de&s;truction of <HI>Angria</HI>'s fleets, &amp;c. yet we may expect that they will continue the practice while commerce la&s;ts.

<P>THIS coa&s;t was equally infamous in the days of <HI>Pliny,</HI> po&s;&s;ibly long before, even as long as commerce became con&s;iderable in the&s;e &s;eas.

<P>WHEN the great <HI>Albuquerque</HI> entered on his vice-royalty,

<P>Unfortuately a mutinous &s;pirit pervaded his army, and even his principal officers.

<P>FROM that moment the able Vice-roy determined to make <HI>Goa</HI> the capital of his ma&s;ter's new acquired dominion in <HI>India:</HI> he gave it every &s;trength his military &s;kill could &s;ugge&s;t, and every encouragement that his wi&s;dom and commercial know|lege could invent. The &s;ucce&s;s was, for a long &s;eries of years, equal to the greatne&s;s of the de&s;ign, and it flouri&s;hed with un|rivalled &s;plendor. It became the center of the riches of <HI>India,</HI> and one of the greate&s;t marts in the univer&s;e. At length the common con&s;equences of wealth, pride, luxury, effeminacy, and every &s;pecies of fraud, cruelty, and oppre&s;&s;ion po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the minds of the&s;e once brave and gallant people; they degenerated into every vile action; and thought nothing wrong that brought in advantage. They e&s;tabli&s;hed here an inqui&s;ition to en&s;lave the minds of the people. They per&s;ecuted the poor natives in every &s;hape, and in every place.

Let me only &s;ay, that the mea&s;ure of their iniquity being filled, they were beaten, and expelled from the very &s;eats conquered by the intrepidity and chivalry of their ance&s;tors; and that by a &s;mall nation, who, &s;allying from the fens of <HI>Holland,</HI> by temperance, wi&s;dom, and fortitude, drove from almo&s;t every part of <HI>India</HI>
<PB N="113" REF="134">that nation, who&s;e monarchs &s;o long had tyranni&s;ed over them in <HI>Europe. Goa,</HI> and &s;ome few places on the <HI>Malabar</HI> coa&s;t, were left to them.

Here the great <HI>Gama,</HI> on <HI>May</HI> 18, 1698, fir&s;t &s;aw the fertile ri&s;ings and plains of <HI>Malabar,</HI> backed by the lofty <HI>Ghauts,</HI> ri&s;e before him. Mr. <HI>Dalrymple,</HI> in one of his plates, gives a view of what it now
<PB N="154" REF="175">is, and, in re&s;pect to its natural &s;ituation, what it mu&s;t have been at that time. The works of art are too minute to be perceptible, amid&s;t the bold and eternal operations of nature.</P>
<P><HI>Calicut</HI> was at that time the greate&s;t <HI>emporium</HI> of all <HI>India.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">ITS ANTIENT TRADE.</NOTE> The commerce of the <HI>Arabs</HI> with this port was prodigious. Pretious &s;tones, pearls, amber, ivory, <HI>China</HI>-ware, gold and &s;ilver, &s;ilks and cottons, indigo, &s;ugar, &s;pices, valuable woods, perfumes, beautiful varni&s;hes, and whatever adds to the luxu|ries of life, were brought there from all parts of the ea&s;t. Some of the&s;e rich commodities came by &s;ea; but as navigation was neither &s;o &s;afe, nor pur&s;ued with &s;o much &s;pirit as it hath been &s;ince, a great part of them was conveyed by land, on the backs of oxen and elephants.</P>
<P>ALL its &s;plendor and all its opulence was owing to commerce, yet the hou&s;es were mean, but not crowded, detached from each other, and &s;urrounded with delicious gardens; none were built of &s;tone, but the royal palace, which ro&s;e with great magnifi|cence above the other buildings. The town was very exten|&s;ive, and very populous.</P>
<P>AT the arrival of the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> it was governed by a mo|narch, <NOTE PLACE="marg">THE ZAMO|REEN.</NOTE> called the <HI>Zamorin,</HI> who, like a lord paramount, had all the other princes of <HI>Malabar</HI> as tributaries. The account, as related by the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> hi&s;torians, is, that &s;ix hundred years before the arrival of <HI>Gama,</HI> or about the year 898, <HI>Perimal</HI> reigned &s;upreme over the whole country. In his old age he became a convert to <HI>Mahometi&s;m,</HI> and determined to re&s;ign his dominions to his relations, and fini&s;h his days at the holy city of <HI>Medina.</HI> His &s;ucce&s;&s;ors retained the antient religion, and are con&s;idered as chief of the <HI>Nayrs.</HI> I will relate the tale in the

<P><HI>Gama</HI> was at fir&s;t well received at <HI>Calicut,</HI> but the jealou&s;y of the <HI>Arabs,</HI> prevented his friend&s;hip with the <HI>Zamorin</HI> from being of any duration. The <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> never could make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the place; but at length <HI>Albuquerque,</HI> in
<PB N="157" REF="178">1503,

This gave him the command of the commerce, notwith&s;tanding the city remained under the line of its antient rulers, who very frequently were engaged in wars with their <HI>European</HI> neighbors. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had their factories here, but, I believe, have long &s;ince de&s;erted the place. As to the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> they became &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, by the union of the <HI>Dutch</HI> with the <HI>Zamorin,</HI> that they blew up their fortre&s;s, and entirely quitted the neighborhood.

In de&s;iance of all attempts to &s;ave it, it was wholly de&s;troyed, and with it peri&s;hed the prince, his family, and va&s;t trea&s;ures.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">PANIANI.</NOTE> What makes it particularly remarkable is, that the <HI>Ghauts,</HI> oppo&s;ite to the place, have in them a gap, be|tween fourteen and fifteen miles in length, and about &s;ixteen miles in width, occupied chiefly by fore&s;t trees, and is defended by the forts of <HI>Annamally</HI> and <HI>Palicaudcherry,</HI> and others: It being the important pa&s;s to and from the <HI>Malabar</HI> coa&s;t, and of late years has been very frequently the &s;eat of action.

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">O&s;orio, lib. i. p. 134.</NOTE>, whom he &s;hould leave on the coa&s;t. After his departure, a quarrel happened between them and the <HI>Zamorin.</HI> A &s;hip loaden with &s;pices was on its way from <HI>Calicut</HI> to <HI>Cranganore;</HI> &s;uch was the avarice of the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> that they could not re&s;i&s;t making it a prize.

All was in vain; they took the &s;hip, and &s;lew &s;ome of the crew. The nephew demanded &s;atisfaction, but his remon&s;trances were received with con|tempt.</P>
<P><HI>Lopez Soarez,</HI> a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> admiral, came into <HI>India</HI> about this time with thirteen &s;hips. He found that the <HI>Zamorin,</HI> and the citizens of <HI>Cranganore,</HI> were preparing to revenge the injuries done them. He &s;ailed for that port, landed his men, and, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the King of <HI>Cochin,</HI> attacked the <HI>Indian</HI> army, gained a complete victory, and pur&s;ued the fugitives into the city, and &s;et it on fire.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BURNT.</NOTE> It was to no purpo&s;e that the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> inhabitants entreated the conquerors to &s;pare their churches. They did indeed attempt to quench the flames, but to no pur|po&s;e, for very few of the places of wor&s;hip e&s;caped. This hap|pened in 1504. The <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> built a &s;trong fort near the &s;pot, about a league up the river, or channel, which is not above a quarter of a mile broad, but very deep, yet on the bar, at &s;pring-tides, had not above fourteen feet of water. A new city aro&s;e, but the <HI>Indians</HI> rebuilt it at &s;ome di&s;tance from the antient &s;ite, and it became one of the &s;ine&s;t in <HI>India.</HI> A chan|nel divides it from another narrow i&s;le, which is about four leagues long, and runs north and &s;outh, parallel with the main land. Another channel divides it from that of <HI>Cochin.</HI> The <HI>Dutch,</HI> under Commodore <HI>Goens,</HI> made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of <HI>Cranganore</HI> in 1660, without meeting the le&s;t re&s;i&s;tance.

As &s;oon as they were ma&s;ters of the place, they prohibited all boats or ve&s;&s;els from entering at the two channels, determined to pre|vent &s;urpri&s;e, and illicit trade.</P>
<P>THIS city was di&s;tingui&s;hed by two mo&s;t remarkable circum|&s;tances:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">JEWS IN INDIA.</NOTE> the one (to begin with the mo&s;t antient) was its having been the re&s;idence of a republic of <HI>Jews,</HI> part of the tribe of <HI>Mana&s;&s;ch,</HI> who had been carried into captivity by <HI>Nebuchadnez|zar,</HI> who &s;ent numbers of them to this di&s;tant place. Their hi&s;tory &s;ays, that they amounted to twenty thou&s;and, and that they were three years in travelling to this place, from the time of their &s;etting out from <HI>Babylon.</HI> When they arrived they were treated with great humanity by the natives, and allowed every indulgence in both religious and temporal concerns. In proce&s;s of time, they grew &s;o wealthy as to purcha&s;e the little kingdom of <HI>Cranganore. Hamilton,</HI> i, p. p. 321, 322, makes them increa&s;e to eighty thou&s;and families, but in his days they were reduced to four thou&s;and. They e&s;tabli&s;hed a common|wealth, and &s;elected the two &s;ons of one of the fir&s;t families, emi|nent for their wi&s;dom, to govern them jointly. One of them, in|&s;tigated by ambition, murdered his brother: after which the commonwealth became a democracy; and their territory, many centuries ago, returned into the hands of the natives. Power|ful as they were, they are at pre&s;ent very poor, and few. Num|bers of them had removed to <HI>God,</HI> where they were greatly encouraged by the <HI>Zamorin</HI> of the time. They have to this
<PB N="163" REF="185">day a &s;ynagogue, near the king's palace, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from <HI>Cochin,</HI> where are pre&s;erved their records, engraven on copper plates, in <HI>Hebrew</HI> characters, and when any of the characters decay, they are new cut, &s;o that they can &s;hew their hi&s;tory from the reign of <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> to the pre&s;ent time.

There are likewi&s;e convents for the prie&s;ts, and nunneries for their women, who adhere to their vows of cha&s;tity with the utmo&s;t probity. Their prie&s;ts are allowed to marry once, but excluded from taking a &s;econd wife. Marriages among&s;t other people cannot be annulled, but by the death of one of the parties. When a woman becomes a widow, &s;he forfeits her dowry if married within a twelve-month after the death of her hu&s;band.

<P>WHEN <HI>Gama</HI> arrived on this coa&s;t, there were about two hun|dred thou&s;and of them in the &s;outhern parts of <HI>Malabar;</HI> during thirteen hundred years they had been under the Patriarch of <HI>Babylon,</HI> who appointed their <HI>Metarene</HI> or Archbi&s;hop. They were extremely aver&s;e to the doctrine of St. <HI>Francis de Xavier,</HI> when he came among them, and abhorred the wor&s;hip of im|ages, which they con&s;idered as idolatry. They refu&s;ed to ac|knowlege the Pope's &s;upremacy, and at length were per|&s;ecuted as heretics, with all the horrors of the inqui&s;ition, newly e&s;tabli&s;hed at <HI>Goa. Xavier</HI> had never troubled his new converts with any in&s;truction, nor ever in&s;tilled into them any knowlege of the principles of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> religion, any farther than implicit obedience to the head of the church. He gave them crucifixes to wor&s;hip, and told them, they were then &s;ure of heaven. His preaching was &s;ub&s;ervient to the political in|tere&s;ts
<PB N="167" REF="189">of his country; his abilities, and his labors for that end were amazing. In him appeared all the powers which, in after times, gave to his order that va&s;t importance in the affairs of the univer&s;e.

In 1789 <HI>Tippoo Sultan,</HI> the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of <HI>Ayder,</HI> determined to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of it, in right of his father.

Another danger followed this. From the de&s;cription, his &s;hip was nearly foundered by the fall of a water-&s;pout. He arrived, at length, at this port, where he gave up his great &s;oul, on <HI>De|cember</HI> 24, 1525, to be judged according to unerring ju&s;tice; for, amid&s;t all his fine qualities, he was deeply tainted with the character of his nation, cruelty.

This i&s;land was celebrated by <HI>Pliny,</HI> lib. viii. c. 9, for its race of elephants, which were larger, and more adapted for war, than tho&s;e of <HI>India.</HI> He al&s;o gives the methods of capture
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. viii. c. 8.</NOTE>. They are, at pre&s;ent, taken in different manners, and after being tamed, are &s;ent to the great annual fair at <HI>Jaffanapatam.</HI> The merchants of <HI>Malabar</HI> and <HI>Bengal,</HI> have notice of the numbers and qualities of the elephants to be &s;et up to &s;ale; &s;ometimes a hundred are &s;old at one fair. A full grown bea&s;t, twelve or fourteen feet high, will be &s;old at the rate of two thou&s;and dollars.</P>
<P>THE manner of taking the&s;e huge animals is thus de&s;cribed by Doctor <HI>Thunberg,</HI> iv. p. 240, who undertook a journey up the country to &s;ee what the <HI>Dutch</HI> call an <HI>Elephant-toil,</HI> or <HI>&s;nare,</HI> "which &s;erved for capturing and inclo&s;ing a great number of elephants. The toil was con&s;tructed of &s;tout cocoa trees, almo&s;t in the form of a triangle, the &s;ide neare&s;t to the wood being very broad, and augmented with &s;lighter trees and bu&s;hes, which gradually extended them&s;elves into two long and impercepti|ble wings. The narrower end was &s;trongly fortified with &s;takes, planted clo&s;e to each other, and held firmly together by ropes, and became at length &s;o narrow, that only one &s;ingle
<PB N="194" REF="216">elephant could &s;queeze it&s;elf into the opening. When the governor gives orders for an elephant chace on the company's account, which happens at the expiration of a certain number of years, it is performed in the following manner: A great multitude of men, as well <HI>European</HI> as <HI>Cingale&s;e,</HI> are &s;ent out into the woods, in the &s;ame manner in which people go out on a general hunt for wolves and bears in the north of <HI>Europe.</HI> The&s;e diffu&s;e them&s;elves, and encompa&s;s a certain extent of land which has been di&s;covered to be frequented by elephants. After this they gradually draw nearer, and with great noi&s;e, vociferation, and beat of drum, contract the area of the circle; in the mean time the elephants approach nearer and nearer to the &s;ide on which the toil is placed. Finally, torches are lighted up, in order to terrify &s;till more the&s;e huge animals, and force them to enter into the toil prepared for them. As &s;oon as they all have entered, the toil is clo&s;ed up behind them. The la&s;t time that elephants were caught in this manner, their numbers amounted to upwards of a hundred, and on former occa&s;ions has &s;ometimes amounted to one hundred and thirty."</P>
<P>"THE fir&s;t care of the captors, is to bring them out of the toil, and to tame them. For this purpo&s;e one or two tame elephants are placed at the &s;ide where the opening is, through which each elephant is let out &s;ingly, when he is immediately bound fa&s;t, with &s;trong ropes, to the tame ones, who di&s;cipline him with their probo&s;cis, till he likewi&s;e becomes tame, and &s;uffers him&s;elf to be handled and managed at plea&s;ure. This di&s;cipli|nary correction frequently proceeds very bri&s;kly, and is &s;ome|times accompli&s;hed in a few days, e&s;pecially as the wild elephant is at the &s;ame time brought under control by hunger."</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">TAILOR-BIRD.</NOTE> <HI>Ind. Zool.</HI> tab. viii, a warbler; on account of its wonderful ne&s;t; my own account of its oeconomy, taken from the <HI>Indian Zoology,</HI> page 44, de&s;erves attention. It is thus introduced:</P>
<P><Q>HAD Providence left the feathered tribe unendowed with any particular in&s;tinct, the birds of the torrid zone would have built their ne&s;ts in the &s;ame unguarded manner as tho&s;e of <HI>Europe:</HI> but there, the le&s;&s;er &s;pecies, having a certain pre&s;cience of the dangers that &s;urround them, and of their own weakne&s;s, &s;u&s;pend their ne&s;t at the extreme branches of the trees: they are con&s;cious of inhabiting a climate replete with enemies to them and their young; with &s;nakes that twine up the bodies of the trees, and apes that are perpetu|ally in &s;earch of prey; but, heaven-in&s;tructed, they clude the gliding of the one, and the activity of the other.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE brute creation in the torrid zone, are more at enmity with one another, than in other climates; and the birds are obliged to exert unu&s;ual artifice in placing their little broods out of the reach of an invader. Each aims at the &s;ame end, though by different means. Some form their penfile ne&s;t in &s;hape of a pur&s;e, deep, and open at top; others, with a hole in the &s;ide; and others, &s;till more cautious, with an entrance at the very bottom, forming their lodge near the &s;ummit.</Q></P>
<P><Q>BUT the little &s;pecies we de&s;cribe, &s;eems to have greater diffidence than any of the others; it will not tru&s;t its ne&s;t even to the extremity of a &s;lender twig, but makes one more advance to &s;afety, by &s;ixing it to the leaf it&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="229"><Q>IT picks up a dead leaf, and, &s;urpri&s;ing to relate, &s;ews it to the &s;ide of a living one, its &s;lender bill being its needle, and its thread &s;ome fine &s;ibres; the lining, feathers, go&s;&s;amer, and down. Its eggs are white: the color of the bird, light yellow; its length three inches; its weight only three &s;ix|teenths of an ounce; &s;o that the materials of the ne&s;t, and its own &s;ize, are not likely to draw down a habitation that de|pends on &s;o &s;light a tenure.</Q></P>
<P>Two fly-catchers, of uncommon form,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FLY-CATCHER.</NOTE> attract the eyes of all &s;trangers: &s;mall birds, with tails of enormous length, darting through the air like arrows. Both are engraved by Mr. <HI>Ed|wards,</HI> one in tab. 113, of a black and white color, with a cunei|form tail; the other with a rufous back and tail, and two fea|thers exceeding the others in length by near nine inches.</P>
<P>As the&s;e are remarkable for the length of their tails, a pie, engraven by Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> in tab. 324, is di&s;tingui&s;hed for the ridiculous brevity of that part, and al&s;o for the beauty of its colors. <HI>Linnaeus</HI> calls it <HI>Corvus Brachyurus.</HI></P>
<P>SWALLOWS (I do not know the &s;pecies) never quit <HI>Ceylon.</HI></P>
<P>PIGEONS in <HI>India</HI> a&s;&s;ume the mo&s;t beautiful colors.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PIGEON.</NOTE> The pompadour pigeon of this i&s;land, <HI>Brown's Illu&s;tr.</HI> tab. xix. xx. the general color of which is a fine pale green; the male di&s;|tingui&s;hed by having the coverts of the wings of a fine pom|padour color, is one proof. I mention this in particular, on account of its hi&s;tory; but more &s;o for that of the magnificent tree on which it u&s;ually alights to &s;eed.</P>
<P>THIS &s;pecies &s;warms in certain &s;ea&s;ons in the i&s;land of <HI>Cey|lon,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FICUS INDICA.</NOTE> particularly when the fruit of the <HI>Ficus Indica,</HI> or broad
<PB N="208" REF="230">leaved <HI>Waringen,</HI> is ripe. They alight in va&s;t multitudes on that grote&s;que tree, and are caught with bird-lime by the na|tives, who prepare the twigs again&s;t their arrival. Mr. <HI>Loten</HI> in|formed me, that when he was governor in <HI>Ceylon,</HI> one morning at break of day he &s;aw &s;ome hundreds entangled on the boughs of the great <HI>Waringen</HI> tree, before his window, and ordered one of his <HI>Ceylone&s;e</HI> &s;ervants to take them off. They are excellent food, and are often &s;hot by the <HI>Europeans.</HI> They are ob&s;erved never to alight on the ground, but to perch on high trees, and give this the preference, on account of the fruit. It is for the &s;ame rea&s;on the haunt of various other birds; but notwith|&s;tanding the &s;weetne&s;s of the fruit, it is neglected by mankind.</P>
<P>THIS tree immediately attracted the attention of the antients. <HI>One&s;icritus,</HI> the philo&s;opher who followed <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great in his expedition into <HI>India,</HI> commanded his galley, and re|corded his actions, fir&s;t gives us an account of this wonderful tree. For this, at le&s;t, he does not merit the &s;evere remark made on him by <HI>Strabo,</HI> lib. xv. p. 1022, who &s;eems incredulous to all he &s;ays; po&s;&s;ibly there may be other points in which he may be al&s;o defended. This tree ri&s;es high in the air, then drops its boughs, which take root, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ively create new &s;tems, till a va&s;t extent is covered with the arched &s;hade. It is even &s;aid to form of it&s;elf a fore&s;t of arched avenues, and a labyrinth of alleys, impenetrable by the rays of the vertical &s;un; perhaps the extent may be exaggerated. We will con|tent our&s;elves with giving the dimen&s;ions of one near <HI>Manjee,</HI> we&s;t of <HI>Patna;</HI> the diameter of which was from three hundred and &s;ixty three feet, to three hundred and &s;eventy three: the
<PB N="209" REF="231">circumference of the &s;hadow at noon, eleven hundred and &s;ix|teen; that of the &s;everal &s;tems, which were no more than fifty or &s;ixty, nine hundred and twenty-one. Hundreds of people may find a comfortable retreat beneath its foliage. Such is the account given by the veracious Mr. <HI>Mar&s;den,</HI> in page 131 of his excellent hi&s;tory of <HI>Sumatra.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pliny,</HI> lib. xii. c. 5, gives the fulle&s;t de&s;cription; he was be&s;t qualified, for by the time he lived, the <HI>Romans</HI> got tolerably well acquainted with the country.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">PEACOCK.</NOTE> Its legs are much longer, and its tail of far greater length in its native &s;tate, than they are with us.

There can be no doubt but that the birds imported were peacocks, not <HI>Aethiopian</HI> parrots, as has been conjectured, natives of a country nearly bordering on the very &s;ea from which his navies took their departure. Apes, ebony, and &s;pices might have been procured from <HI>Africa,</HI> on one hand, or <HI>Arabia</HI> on the other; but peacocks and pretious &s;tones, &s;eem at all times the mono|poly of <HI>India.</HI></P>

<P>THIS valuable tree grows in greater quantity in the i&s;le of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> than any other place. It grows wild in the woods, with|out any culture: every province does not po&s;&s;e&s;s it, there is none in that of <HI>Jaffanapatam,</HI> nor <HI>Manaar,</HI> but abound in mo&s;t of the internal parts, and about <HI>Negumbo</HI> and <HI>Gale.</HI> A pigeon, I think the Pompadour, <HI>Brown's Illu&s;tr.</HI> tab. 19, is the &s;pecies, which, by carrying the fruit to different places, is a great di&s;|&s;eminator of this valuable tree. I do not believe it to be pecu|liar to this i&s;land; but the bark is infinitely &s;uperior in quality to any other. Botani&s;ts enumerate numbers of kinds, but they only vary being taken from trees of different ages, or growing in different &s;oils, and &s;ituations. It may be found in <HI>Malabar, Sumatra,</HI> &amp;c. but is depretiated by another name, <HI>Ca&s;&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Canella,</HI> to our un&s;peakable lo&s;s;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CINNAMON, OR CASSIA.</NOTE> <HI>Cinnamomum</HI> was a more dig|nified name. The antients &s;peak of it under that title, in &s;uch high terms, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> wi&s;ely retained the name, which gave it greate&s;t re&s;pectability. Our countryman, the late <HI>Taylor White,</HI> E&s;q. in Ph. Tran&s;. vol. l. p. 860, and Mr. <HI>Combes,</HI> re&s;i|dent in <HI>Sumatra,</HI> in page 873, are entirely of opinion, that <HI>Cin|namon</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;&s;ia</HI> do not &s;pecifically differ. Mr. <HI>White</HI>'s account is accompanied with &s;ome very good figures of the leaves of the former.</P>
<P>THE celebrated bark is the inner, and is reckoned the mo&s;t perfect when taken from trees of &s;even or eight years old, if they grow in a wet &s;limy &s;oil; but tho&s;e which grow in the warm white
<PB N="224" REF="246">&s;and of the vallies, come to maturity in five years. <HI>Seba</HI> &s;ays, that the ages of the trees are fourteen, fifteen, or &s;ixteen years. It is the heat which gives the bark that quilled form in which it comes over to us, e&s;pecially the &s;maller and more delicate &s;ort, which is taken from the &s;maller branches. The bark is fir&s;t freed from the external coat, when it is on the trees; is then cut lengthways, &s;tripped off, dried in the &s;and, and &s;o becomes merchantable.</P>
<P>THE barkers of cinnamon are brought up to the trade, and are called <HI>Chialia&s;es.</HI> The account given by Mr. <HI>E&s;chel&s;kroon</HI> of the management, is mo&s;t authentic; from him I &s;hall tran&s;|cribe what will be highly &s;atisfactory to the readers. At page 339 of <HI>Wolfe</HI>'s account of the i&s;le of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> he begins thus:&mdash;
<Q>The time for barking the tree commences in the months of <HI>June</HI> and <HI>July,</HI> and &s;ometimes even in <HI>Augu&s;t:</HI> now as &s;oon as they come out of their villages for that purpo&s;e, every di&s;|trict &s;ends a detachment of <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;oldiers, and another com|po&s;ed of the natives them&s;elves, called <HI>La&s;caryns,</HI> along with them, in order to guard the wood where they are to work, and this partly on account of the roving <HI>Cingale&s;e</HI> moun|taineers, which &s;ometimes fall on the barked cinnamon, and make it their booty; but &s;till more for the purpo&s;e of having an eye upon the <HI>Chialia&s;es</HI> them&s;elves, that they may not be able to conceal any of the cinnamon, and afterwards carry it off.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE bark that is peeled during the day, mu&s;t be carried every evening to the <HI>Dutch</HI> guard, belonging to their re&s;pective di&s;|tricts; there clean&s;ed, well dried, and made up into bundles, and afterwards taken in clo&s;e ca&s;es to the factory, where they
<PB N="225" REF="247">are weighed, and received by the company as payment of the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment or tax impo&s;ed on the&s;e people by government. A man mu&s;t be a very good hand indeed, that can gather thirty pounds of cinnamon in a day; whence it is ea&s;ily calculated, how many per&s;ons it will take to gather ten or twelve million pounds, and that too of the be&s;t; for what is brought in is looked over before it is weighed, and the refu&s;e of it burned.</Q></P>
<P><Q>At the time for gathering this drug, the company are obliged to draw out a <HI>cordon</HI> of &s;eventy-two miles in cir|cumference; and as there are a great many of the&s;e <HI>corps de garde,</HI> it follows that the company mu&s;t pay a great many <HI>Europeans,</HI> as well as <HI>Cingale&s;e.</HI> The&s;e cinnamon barkers are under the command of a captain, called a <HI>Malabadde,</HI> and are di&s;tributed into four different cla&s;&s;es. All the <HI>Chilia&s;es</HI> mu&s;t be ready at all times to work at the Governor's command, for on him it depends how much is to be barked and delivered in; and this again depends on the demand for it from <HI>Europe.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THIS important article of luxury was well known to the an|tients. The <HI>Greeks</HI> called it <GAP DESC="foreign">, and &s;ometimes <GAP DESC="foreign">, or <HI>Ca&s;ia Lignea,</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign">, to the bark, from the pipe|like form it a&s;&s;umed by the rolling up. We have applied the word <HI>Ca&s;&s;ia</HI> to the inferior cinnamons of <HI>Malabar</HI> and <HI>Su|matra.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Romans</HI> called it <HI>Cinnamomum,</HI> but generally with &s;ome addition. The <HI>Xylo-cinnamomum,</HI> or the wood, we are told by <HI>Pliny,</HI> was &s;old for twenty <HI>denarii,</HI> or twelve &s;hillings and eleven pence <HI>per</HI> pound. The juice, or expre&s;&s;ed oil, at one thou&s;and
<PB N="226" REF="248"><HI>denarii,</HI> or &pound;.32. 5. 10. The <HI>Daphnoides,</HI> or <HI>I&s;ocinnamon,</HI> &s;eems not to be thought the genuine kind, yet &s;old at the price of three hundred <HI>denarii,</HI> or &pound;.8. 13. 9, the &s;ame price as the true <HI>cinnamon.</HI> The <HI>Cinnamomum camocans</HI> was the expre&s;&s;ed juice of a nut, and perhaps a different article from the true <HI>cin|namon,</HI> was &s;old for no more than forty a&s;&s;es, or two &s;hillings and &s;even-pence. The antients, according to <HI>Pliny,</HI> e&s;teemed, as we do at pre&s;ent, the cinnamon of the young twigs. It was chiefly made u&s;e of as a perfume, either as an ingredient for their unguents, or to rub their bodies with, in form of oil. They appear to have been ignorant of the tree that produced it, as well as the country; they &s;uppo&s;ed that it came from that part of <HI>Aethiopia</HI> which bordered on the <HI>Troglodytes. Pliny</HI> &s;ays they bought all they could of their neighbors; but even Mr. <HI>Bruce,</HI> who would certainly do all the honor he could to <HI>Aethio|pia,</HI> never mentions it among his botanical enumerations. <HI>Pliny</HI> talks confu&s;edly of a long voyage made with the cargoes of this pretious article, and of the cro&s;&s;ing of va&s;t &s;eas: of the cinna|mon being under the protection of the god <HI>A&s;&s;abinus,</HI> and of its never being cut without his permi&s;&s;ion. I dare &s;ay that the <HI>Cinnamon</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;&s;ia</HI> came then as it does now, from the <HI>Ma|labar</HI> coa&s;t, and <HI>Taprobone</HI> or <HI>Ceylon,</HI> and that the merchants cro&s;&s;ing the <HI>Sinus Aethiopicus</HI> in &s;earch of it, induced the <HI>Roman</HI> Naturali&s;t to make <HI>Aethiopia</HI> its native country
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pliny, in lib. xii. c. xix. and other parts of his Nat. Hi&s;t, treats largely of this tree.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE antients give a mo&s;t romantic account of the&s;e trees, that of their being guarded by a dire &s;pecies of bat, fighting cruelly with their &s;harp claws; and by flying &s;erpents; one was
<PB N="227" REF="249">the enormous bat of the torrid zone; the others, the winged lizard, before de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>ITS modern u&s;e for culinary purpo&s;es is unknown to none. <HI>Cinnamon-water</HI> is al&s;o a fine <HI>liqueur.</HI> From the leaves is ex|tracted a thick and fragrant juice, appropriated for the candles of his imperial Maje&s;ty of <HI>Ceylon;</HI> and from the roots is ex|tracted the oil of camphire, and a &s;ort of camphire &s;uperior to what we have in the &s;hops, which likewi&s;e is re&s;erved for the Emperor, who e&s;teems it an excellent cordial. <HI>Seba,</HI> in Ph. Tran&s;. abr. vi. 326, from whom we have the account, &s;peaks highly of its virtue in <HI>arthritic</HI> ca&s;es. The bark, and e&s;&s;ential oil, is an article in our di&s;pen&s;ary.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">TRINCOMALE.</NOTE> <HI>Trincomale</HI> harbour is in Lat. 8&deg; 30&Prime;, a fine and &s;ecure port, protected by a &s;trong garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of about four hundred men. Such was the number in fort <HI>O&s;tenburgh,</HI> when it was taken by a&s;&s;ault, on <HI>January</HI> 11, 1782, by our brave &s;eaman, Sir <HI>Edward Hughes;</HI> which, on <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 26 of the &s;ame year, was wre&s;ted from us by his active and gallant rival <HI>Suf|frein.</HI></P>
<P>ON <HI>September</HI> 2d, the former came off <HI>Trincomale,</HI> and to his great &s;urpri&s;e found the <HI>French</HI> colors flying on all the forts, <HI>Suffrein,</HI> with a &s;uperior &s;quadron, &s;ailed out of the harbour, &s;ecure, as he thought, of victory. Our brave admiral, and his officers, enraged at the lo&s;s of the place, eagerly accepted the offer of combat. The contending admirals di&s;played every proof of courage and &s;kill. <HI>Suffrein</HI>'s &s;hip was reduced to a wreck, and he obliged to remove his flag to another. By &s;ome neglect of ours we lo&s;t the di&s;abled &s;hip. Night alone terminated the battle. <HI>Suffrein</HI> retired into <HI>Trincomale,</HI> crowding in without order. Thus &s;ecured, <HI>Hughes</HI> left him reluctantly, and &s;ailed for <HI>Madras</HI> with his &s;hattered &s;quadron. Our lo&s;s was incon&s;i|derable, in common men, for it did not exceed fifty-one killed
<PB N="254" REF="277">and three hundred wounded. In officers we &s;uffered &s;everely. The captains <HI>Lumley, Watt,</HI> and <HI>Wood</HI> fell in the action. The lo&s;s of the <HI>French</HI> was enormous. Four hundred and twelve men were killed, and &s;ix hundred and &s;eventy-&s;ix were wound|ed. The carnage on board the gallant <HI>Suffrein</HI>'s &s;hip, the <HI>Hero,</HI> was unheard in any fight of any age, it was an unparalleled car|nage. Many of the <HI>French</HI> captains had behaved ill, &s;ix were broke, and &s;ent pri&s;oners to the i&s;land of <HI>Mauritius;</HI> and thus ended the unavailing &s;laughters in the <HI>Indian</HI> &s;eas.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF SIR WILLIAM JAMES, BARONET;</HEAD>
<BYLINE>COMMUNICATED BY LADY JAMES.</BYLINE>
<P>SIR WILLIAM JAMES embarked in a &s;ea life at twelve years of age. He was more than twenty years at &s;ea before he got the command of a &s;hip. He was with Sir <HI>Edward Hawke</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> in 1738, as a junior officer. Some years after, he commanded a &s;hip in the <HI>Virginia</HI> trade; in her he was taken by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> in the Gulph of <HI>Florida,</HI> and carried a pri|&s;oner to the <HI>Havannah.</HI> His &s;ufferings after his captivity will be related herea&s;ter:&mdash;In the beginning of 1747, he went to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies</HI> as chief officer of one of the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Com|pany's &s;hips, and performed two voyages in that &s;tation. In 1749, the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company appointed him to the command of a new &s;hip called the <HI>Guardian,</HI> equipped as a &s;hip of war; in her he &s;ailed to <HI>Bombay,</HI> to protect the trade on the <HI>Malabar</HI> coa&s;t, which was much annoyed by the depredations of <HI>Angria,</HI> and other pirates, with which tho&s;e &s;eas &s;warmed.</P>
<P>DURING two years he was con&s;tantly employed in convoying the merchant &s;hips from <HI>Bombay</HI> and <HI>Surat,</HI> to the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> the Gulph of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and up and down the <HI>Malabar</HI> coa&s;t, from the Gulph of <HI>Cambay</HI> to Cape <HI>Comorin.</HI> He was frequently attacked on this &s;ervice by the different piratical &s;tates. At one time, when he had near &s;eventy &s;ail of &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els under his charge, he was a&s;&s;ailed by a large fleet of <HI>Angria</HI>'s frigates and
<PB N="258" REF="281">gallivats, full of men. With the <HI>Guardian, Bombay</HI> grab, and <HI>Drake</HI> bomb ketch, he engaged the enemy, and kept them in clo&s;e action, whil&s;t his fleet got &s;afe into <HI>Tellicherry.</HI> In this conflict he &s;unk one of the enemies large&s;t gallivats, and ob|liged the re&s;t to &s;eek for &s;afety in <HI>Gheriah</HI> and <HI>Severndroog.</HI></P>
<P>ABOUT the beginning of the year 1751, Sir <HI>William</HI> was ap|pointed commander in chief of the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company's ma|rine forces, and hoi&s;ted his broad pendant on board the <HI>Pro|tector,</HI> a &s;ine &s;hip of 44 guns. On <HI>April</HI> 2d, 1755, he was &s;ent with the <HI>Protector, Guardian, Bombay</HI> grab, and <HI>Drake</HI> bomb, with &s;ome gallivats, to attempt &s;uch of the ports belonging to <HI>Angria</HI> which lie to the northward of <HI>Gheriah,</HI> his principal fortre&s;s, and capital.</P>
<P>THE chief of the&s;e fortre&s;&s;es was <HI>Severndroog,</HI> where <HI>Angria</HI>'s ve&s;&s;els refitted, and took &s;helter when they could not reach <HI>Ghe|riah.</HI> It was well defended by batteries along the &s;hore, and the entrance of the harbour was &s;ecured by a &s;trong ca&s;tle, on which were mounted &s;eventy pieces of cannon. <HI>Angria</HI>'s people con|&s;idered <HI>Severndroog</HI> as their &s;tronge&s;t hold next to <HI>Gheriah.</HI> Sir <HI>William,</HI> having reconnoitred the place, and informed him&s;elf of its &s;trength, brought his &s;hips with a leading wind clo&s;e to the ca&s;tle-walls, and by a &s;teady well-directed fire (whil&s;t the <HI>Drake</HI> threw in her bombs) &s;oon brought on a parley, and in le&s;s than three hours the governor &s;urrendered the ca&s;tle, and the ve&s;&s;els in the harbour; from hence Sir <HI>William</HI> went to <HI>Fort Victoria,</HI> which quickly followed the fate of <HI>Severndroog;</HI> and the next day four other forts were numbered in his con|que&s;ts: all the&s;e falling, was a &s;evere blow to <HI>Angria,</HI> who
<PB N="259" REF="282">had a &s;hort time before attacked a fleet of <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;hips, under the protection of a 50 gun &s;hip and a frigate: The <HI>Dutch</HI> fleet was di&s;per&s;ed, and the 50 gun &s;hip, and &s;ome of the merchant|men, were brought in great triumph to <HI>Gheriah.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN Sir <HI>William</HI> returned with his victorious fleet to <HI>Bom|bay,</HI> he found Admiral <HI>Wat&s;on</HI> there, with three line-of-battle &s;hips, and &s;ome frigates, &amp;c. The government of <HI>Bombay</HI> con|&s;ulted with the Admiral about means to de&s;troy the powers of <HI>Angria,</HI> and the <HI>Mahratta</HI> &s;tates joined in the confederacy, for they had &s;uffered by his depredations.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>William</HI> was &s;ent with his little &s;quadron to reconnoitre <HI>Gheriah,</HI> a place repre&s;ented to be almo&s;t impregnable from the &s;ea. He judiciou&s;ly &s;tood clo&s;e in to the walls, under the cover of night, and with his boat &s;ounded and examined the channels leading to the harbour, and outer road; in the day-time he &s;tood in within gun-&s;hot of the walls; and having in two days made him&s;elf perfectly ma&s;ter of the enemy's &s;trength, he re|turned to <HI>Bombay.</HI> This piece of &s;ervice he performed with &s;o much promptne&s;s and &s;kill, that he received the thanks of the Governor and Admiral; and they were &s;o well per&s;uaded, from his report, of the practicability of the enterprize, that no time was lo&s;t in equipping the &s;hips, and embarking the troops.</P>
<P>THE &s;quadron formed off <HI>Gheriah</HI> the 10th <HI>February,</HI> 1756. Sir <HI>William,</HI> in the <HI>Protector,</HI> led the &s;quadron to the attack in one divi&s;ion, whil&s;t another divi&s;ion of frigates led the bomb|ketches in another line; a heavy and tremendous &s;ire began on our part from the &s;hips of the line, whil&s;t the &s;hells were thrown with great &s;ucce&s;s from the bombs into the harbour, where all <HI>Angria</HI>'s &s;hips were hawled for &s;afety; the&s;e were &s;oon &s;et on
<PB N="260" REF="283">fire by the bombs; the fire from the ca&s;tle and batteries &s;oon &s;lackened, and before the evening &s;et in, the ca&s;tle &s;urrendered, and <HI>Gheriah,</HI> and all its dependencies, fell into our hands. Thus &s;hortly ended an enterprize, which, for many years, had been in contemplation by the <HI>European</HI> governments in <HI>India,</HI> but which was never before attempted, from an idea that no force &s;ufficient could be brought again&s;t the walls of this ca&s;tle. Lord <HI>Clive,</HI> at this time a lieutenant-colonel, commanded the land forces.</P>
<P>ON the <HI>Malabar</HI> coa&s;t, &s;oon after this, he fell in with a <HI>French</HI> &s;hip from <HI>Mauritius,</HI> very much his &s;uperior in men and guns; &s;he was called <HI>l'Indienne:</HI> after a &s;mart action &s;he &s;truck, and Sir <HI>William</HI> carried her in triumph to <HI>Bombay.</HI></P>
<P>SIR <HI>William James,</HI> in an eminent manner, di&s;played his nautical abilities, by &s;hewing, that in de&s;pight of a contrary mon&s;oon, a communication between <HI>Bombay</HI> and the <HI>Coro|mandel</HI> coa&s;t may be effected in ca&s;es of exigency
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The tracks are laid down in Mr. Arrow&s;inith's map of the world.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS pa&s;&s;age was attempted by Sir <HI>William</HI> in the fir&s;t in|&s;tance, and he accompli&s;hed it in nearly as &s;hort a time as it u&s;ually was done in the favorable mon&s;oon. It was of the ut|mo&s;t moment that he &s;ucceeded at the time he did, for by it, he con&s;irmed to Admiral <HI>Wat&s;on</HI> (then in the <HI>Ganges)</HI> the intelli|gence of the war with <HI>France,</HI> and brought to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance 500 troops, by which the Admiral and Colonel <HI>Clive</HI> were ena|bled, in <HI>March</HI> 1757, to take <HI>Chandenagore,</HI> the chief of the <HI>French</HI> &s;ettlements in <HI>Bengal.</HI></P>
<P>IN effecting this pa&s;&s;age, the commodore cro&s;&s;ed the equator
<PB N="261" REF="284">in the meridian of <HI>Bombay,</HI> and continued his cour&s;e to the &s;outhward as far as the tenth degree, and then was enabled to go as far to the ea&s;tward as the meridian of <HI>Atcheen</HI> head, the N. W. extremity of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> from whence, with the N. E. mon&s;oon, which then prevaled in the bay of <HI>Bengal,</HI> he could with ea&s;e gain the entrance of the <HI>Ganges,</HI> or any port on the <HI>Coromandel</HI> coa&s;t.</P>
<P>IN the beginning of this narrative it was mentioned, Sir <HI>Wil|liam</HI> had &s;uffered &s;hipwreck. The uncommon hard&s;hips he and his people encountered were as follows:&mdash;After they were relea&s;ed from the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> pri&s;on at the <HI>Havannah,</HI> they em|barked in a &s;mall brig for <HI>Carolina.</HI> The crew of the brig, and Sir <HI>William</HI> and his people, amounted to fifteen. The &s;econd day after putting to &s;ea, a very hard gale of wind came on; the ve&s;&s;el &s;trained, and &s;oon became &s;o leaky, that the pumps and the people bailing could not keep her free; and at length, be|ing worn out with labor, &s;even of them, with Sir <HI>William,</HI> got into the only boat they had, with a &s;mall bag of bi&s;cuit and a keg of water; the ve&s;&s;el &s;oon after di&s;appeared, and went down. They were twenty days in this boat without a compa&s;s; their bi&s;cuit &s;oon got wet with the &s;ea, which for two days made a breach over the boat; a &s;nuff-box Sir <HI>William</HI> had with him &s;erved to di&s;tribute their daily allowance of water; and after encountering every difficulty of famine and &s;evere labor, on the twentieth day they found them&s;elves on the i&s;land of <HI>Cuba,</HI> not ten miles from whence they had been embarked out of a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> pri&s;on: but a pri&s;on had no horrors to them. The <HI>Spa|niards</HI> received them once more into captivity; and it is remark|able,
<PB N="262" REF="285">that only one out of the &s;even peri&s;hed, though after they got on &s;hore, but few of them had the u&s;e of their limbs for many days.</P>
<P>IN the year 1759, Sir <HI>William</HI> returned to his native country. The <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company pre&s;ented him with a hand&s;ome ele|gant gold-hilted &s;word, with a complimentary motto, expre&s;&s;ive of their &s;en&s;e of his gallant &s;ervices. Soon afterwards he was cho&s;en a director, and continued a member of that re&s;pectable body more than twenty years; in which time he had filled both the chairs. He was fifteen years deputy ma&s;ter of the corpora|tion of <HI>Trinity Hou&s;e;</HI> a governor of <HI>Greenwich</HI> ho&s;pital; &s;erved two &s;e&s;&s;ions in parliament for <HI>We&s;t Looe;</HI> and on the 25th of <HI>July</HI> 1778, the King was plea&s;ed to create him a baronet.</P>
<P>He planned the reduction of <HI>Pondicherry</HI> during the <HI>Ame|rican</HI> war, and received a rich &s;ervice of plate from the <HI>India</HI> Company, as a te&s;timony of their &s;en&s;e of his &s;kill and judg|ment in that affair.</P>
<P>ON the 16th <HI>December,</HI> 1783, Sir <HI>William</HI> died, aged 62. In the year following, a hand&s;ome building was erected on his e&s;tate in <HI>Kent,</HI> near the top of <HI>Shooter's Hill;</HI> it is built in the &s;tyle of a ca&s;tle, with three &s;ides, and commands a mo&s;t exten&s;ive view. The lowe&s;t room is adorned with weapons peculiar to the dif|ferent countries of the Ea&s;t. The room above has different views of naval actions and enterprizes painted on the ceiling, in which Sir <HI>William</HI> had been a con&s;iderable actor. The top of the build|ing is fini&s;hed with battlements about &s;ixty feet from the ba&s;e. The top of the battlements are four hundred and eighty feet above the level of <HI>Shooter's Hill,</HI> and more than a hundred and
<PB N="263" REF="286">forty feet higher than the top of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s cupola.&mdash;On a tablet over the entrance door is this in&s;cription:
<Q><L>This Building was erected M.DCC.LXXXIV.</L>
<L>by the Repre&s;entative of the late</L>
<L>Sir WILLIAM JAMES, Bart.</L>
<L>to commemorate that gallant Officer's Atchievements in the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI></L>
<L>during his Command of the Company's Marine Forces in tho&s;e Seas;</L>
<L>and in a particular Manner to record the Conque&s;t of</L>
<L>the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Severndroog,</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malabar,</HI></L>
<L>which fell to his &s;uperior Valour and able Conduct</L>
<L>on the 2d Day of <HI>April</HI> M.DCC.LV.</L></Q></P>
<P>OF Sir <HI>William,</HI> it is &s;aid, by a per&s;on who knew him inti|mately near thirty years, and was well acquainted with his pro|fe&s;&s;ional abilities; That as a thorough practical &s;eaman, he was almo&s;t without an equal:&mdash;As an officer, he was brave, vigilant, prompt, and re&s;olute; patient in difficulty, with a pre|&s;ence of mind that &s;eemed to grow from danger.</P>
