<HEAD>LUXURY NO POLITICAL EVIL.</HEAD>
<P>THE influence of Luxury on the pro&s;pe|rity of States, gives ri&s;e to one of tho&s;e que&s;tions, on which mo&s;t men have &s;omething to &s;ay; but wherein they gene|rally di&s;agree.</P>
<P>If to acquire a ju&s;t idea of Luxury, with re&s;pect to bodies politic, were a matter of mere curio&s;ity, one would not dream of treating on a &s;ubject, which &s;o many wri|ters have handled already, and to little pur|po&s;e; but the rea&s;oning which may be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed on this head is of the utmo&s;t import|ance.
<PB N="2" REF="5">
It intere&s;ts the pro&s;perity of States, and, of cour&s;e, it is the duty of a good citizen to throw all the light upon it he can.</P>
<P>There is one &s;triking ob&s;ervation that oc|curs upon this &s;ubject; though in theory the common opinion is again&s;t it; in prac|tice, the world is for it: though morali&s;ts inveigh again&s;t it, wi&s;e &s;tate&s;men have en|couraged it. If Luxury be a vice, and cau&s;e tho&s;e di&s;a&s;ters &s;o often imputed to it, why have not &s;ome mea&s;ures been taken to &s;up|pre&s;s it? But if, on the contrary, it be a nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ource, without which every thing would langui&s;h, we cannot place this truth in too clear a view, le&s;t any unfore|&s;een, any impolitic attack upon it &s;hould de|&s;troy that &s;ource, on which the opulence of the State, and public welfare, depend.</P>
<P>Where there is a certain extent of empire, the genius and labour of a numerous people are able to effect wonders; and it is the chief intere&s;t of &s;uch a State to encourage labour and indu&s;try to the utmo&s;t.</P>
<P>Nature facilitates this object, by that di|ver&s;ity &s;he has &s;cattered in her productions;
<PB N="3" REF="6">
by the wants &s;he has laid man open to; by the faculty &s;he has endowed him with, and by the de&s;ire &s;he has implanted in him, for all kinds of indulgences, con&s;i&s;tent with his being.</P>
<P>The legi&s;lature, then, after the mo&s;t &s;acred a&s;&s;urances to the artificer, that he &s;hall en|joy the whole fruits of his labour, ought to leave <HI>him</HI> to the full &s;cope of his abilities, and the con&s;umer to the luxuriance of his fancy; without any other re&s;triction, than to prohibit the purcha&s;e of foreign produc|tions, and that only in certain ca&s;es, very maturely con&s;idered, and more &s;eldom re|&s;trained than is commonly thought nece&s;|&s;ary.</P>
<P>Certain a&s;&s;urances that every one &s;hall receive the price of his labour is &s;o capital a condition, that, without it, emulation would die away; and the hope of obtain|ing by our labour &s;ufficient to gratify our wi&s;hes, is another condition equally capital, without which there would &s;carce be any emulation at all.</P>
<P>Could we &s;uppo&s;e a &s;tate where luxuries are prohibited, men would be, in a great
<PB N="4" REF="7">
mea&s;ure, idle; for our natural wants con|&s;uming le&s;s than our labour will produce, if other incitements did not actuate the in|du&s;try of the people, the progre&s;s of the State would &s;tand &s;till, when it might other|wi&s;e be carried to a great extent; for, though the lei&s;ure hours of the people might be employed in &s;ecuring their ter|ritory from the encroachments of an ene|my, yet, the&s;e being completed, time would hang heavy upon their hands; and, as ex|ce&s;s of plenty would embarra&s;s, and men are not fond of working without a pro&s;pect of per&s;onal advantage, they would limit their productions to the bounds of con|&s;umption, and, being forbidden the enjoy|ment of indulgences, they wouId work no more.</P>
<P>But if, among a numerous people, the workman be left to the full &s;cope of his indu&s;try, and the con&s;umer to the luxuri|ance of his fancy, the mind will unfold, and arts will multiply; every inclination be animated, and the State, if not checked in its progre&s;s by a defect in its con&s;titu|tion,
<PB N="5" REF="8">
will &s;tretch to the utmo&s;t extent of pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>For the arts, whether u&s;eful or frivolous, create, without intermi&s;&s;ion, a variety of in|dulgences, many indeed of a &s;hort dura|tion, but which leave with us &s;uch a wi&s;h for their continuance, as to become after|wards a kind of want. Hence, a &s;pirit of indu&s;try is kept up; hence, an abundance of every thing we wi&s;h; hence, a nume|rous population. This chain of effects brings wealth, brings &s;trength, brings la&s;t|ing felicity to an empire.</P>
<P>Wealth re&s;ults from this chain of effects, by the quantity of materials produced; and &s;trength, by the number of men the&s;e ma|terials &s;upport.</P>
<P>But, with re&s;pect to a numerous popula|tion, we mu&s;t advert to ob&s;ervation, and rea&s;on from the &s;uperintendence of Provi|dence, which is particularly careful of every &s;pecies of animals, increa&s;ing or dimini&s;h|ing the &s;pecies, in proportion to the quan|tity of provi&s;ions among them, and the u&s;es to which they are appropriated. Bea&s;ts of prey, that proul the de&s;arts for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence,
<PB N="6" REF="9">
and which, being of a carnivorous kind, men u&s;e not for food, are &s;low breeders, and very few in number; &s;uch are, the lion, the tiger, and &s;ome others: but graminivorous animals, that live upon the &s;pontaneous pro|ductions of the earth, &s;uch as the &s;heep, the &s;wine, the hare, and many others, are fa&s;t breeders, and multiply exceedingly; for the&s;e would live even without the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of man. Where there is plenty of food, the animal race will multiply &s;urpri&s;ingly, witne&s;s the great encrea&s;e of vermin in a gra|nary full of corn. And as it is with ani|mals of an inferior cla&s;s, &s;o it is with man. One man and one woman might, in the na|ture of things, have thirty children; but, in general, they might have ten, five males and five females. At every generation, then, was mankind propagated to the ut|mo&s;t, they would increa&s;e in number five times; &s;o that, in a very &s;hort &s;pace of time, a nation might become exceedingly popu|lous. Now, it is the difficulty of procur|ing food, and obtaining the nece&s;&s;aries of life, that checks this propagation. A very wi&s;e interference of Providence!&mdash;Hence it
<PB N="7" REF="10">
is, that, in the brutal creation, the lione&s;s does not breed &s;o fa&s;t as the hare, it requir|ing a large tract of country to &s;upply the former with food; and hence it is, with the human &s;pecies, in tribes of &s;avages, who live by hunting, and require an exten&s;ive di&s;trict to furni&s;h them with provi&s;ions, that propagation does not take place in &s;o great a degree as in civilized &s;ocieties, where, by the genius and indu&s;try of man, a few acres of ground are rendered &s;ufficient to &s;upport a family.</P>
<P>As the wealth, then, and &s;trength of a country depend, in a great mea&s;ure, upon its population; and as population increa&s;es or dimini&s;hes in proportion to the provi&s;ions of life; would it not be wi&s;e to encourage hu&s;bandry, as well as manufactures, and cul|tivate the country to the utmo&s;t?</P>
<P>But to return to my &s;ubject. Though man is formed to live upon the &s;pontaneous productions of the earth, a thir&s;t for Luxu|ries is natural to him; and without &s;uch a thir&s;t, &s;ocieties could neither flouri&s;h nor exi&s;t. Without a de&s;ire for Luxuries, our intellectual faculties would be a di&s;advan|tage
<PB N="8" REF="11">
to us; we &s;hould langui&s;h away our hours in &s;tupidity, occupied only with the momentary want; and that being, de&s;tined by nature to unite it&s;elf with its fellow-crea|tures in embelli&s;hing the earth, would wear away its days in &s;olitude, lo&s;t in the fore&s;ts with the lower cla&s;s of animals. It is the idea alone of improving our &s;ituation, and adding to our happine&s;s, that urges us to the trouble of thinking; and to no other ob|ject could our under&s;tanding be applied.</P>
<P>The views of creation take place with certainty; they produce their effects infal|libly. Though man, in the mid&s;t of unfa|vourable circum&s;tances that weaken or check the exertion of his faculties, be &s;till, through the favour of Providence, in a &s;ituation to pre&s;erve his exi&s;tence, without any other care than that of gathering the provi&s;ions that are &s;cattered round him; and though this may &s;ugge&s;t to him an idea of being in &s;olitude; yet the Author of all that breathes has not left him at liberty to withdraw him|&s;elf from the purpo&s;es for which he was created. That active &s;pirit, that intellectu|all faculty, that power of completion with
<PB N="9" REF="12">
which he is endowed, will not &s;uffer him to &s;hut him&s;elf up in the narrow &s;phere of ab|&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity. It re&s;ts not with him to re|ject his benefits, when he perceives the means of procuring them. His fir&s;t at|tempts make him &s;en&s;ible of a want of union with other men; and this is the origin of all &s;ocieties.</P>
<P>As a thir&s;t then for indulgences or Luxu|ries, or a wi&s;h to render life more comfort|able than nature be&s;tows it, is the fir&s;t cau&s;e of &s;ocieties, &s;o it is the very &s;oul and &s;upport of them. The more raging this thir&s;t is, the more men &s;tudy to reap advantages from one another, and from every thing about them. The mind quickens; the means of every individual increa&s;e, and the&s;e means are the &s;inews of the body po|litic.</P>
<P>What &s;trength would a &s;ociety of naked &s;avages have, repo&s;ing in a thicket, living from day to day by hunting, and on wild fruits; changing their place of abode, as they exhau&s;t the di&s;trict, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing only a bow, a few arrows, and perhaps a toma|hawk,
<PB N="10" REF="13">
and having no time to &s;pare from the &s;earch of their daily food?</P>
<P>Such a &s;ociety cannot derive an advan|tage even from numbers; the mode of each man's living requiring a great extent of ground. Now, independent of that check to population, occa&s;ioned by fatigue and &s;carcity of food, incident to &s;uch a &s;tate of life; it is evident, that if families here en|crea&s;e, they will be obliged to divide and &s;eparate at great di&s;tances from each other, in order to procure provi&s;ions; and pre&s;ent|ly becoming enemies, by contention for an object &s;o e&s;&s;ential as food, they will fall on one another furiou&s;ly. Such is the picture the uncivilized part of the world pre&s;ents us.</P>
<P>The &s;avage, however, who makes u&s;e of a bow, has already &s;tept over the fir&s;t boun|daries of his nature. This in&s;trument is a convenience, by which he extends his pri|mitive power, and facilitates the execution of his de&s;igns. It is a &s;pecies of Luxury. This &s;avage, without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, could &s;upply his wants, before he had a bow. He who makes u&s;e of a carriage, well hung, to convey him&s;elf without fatigue where
<PB N="11" REF="14">
his affairs call him, acts no otherwi&s;e than he who employs a weapon to obtain his prey, without being at the trouble of run|ning after it.</P>
<P>A little reflection will be &s;ufficient to &s;hew the effects which a de&s;ire to render life comfortable has, upon the &s;trength and power of a nation.</P>
<P>Once a &s;ociety of men, weary of wander|ing and living in the open air, begins to erect cabbins for their defence again&s;t the in|juries of time, and of cour&s;e to fix their abode, it is ea&s;y to conceive that this fir&s;t idea of convenience will give birth to a thou|&s;and others. The &s;ame inclination that produces one, leads them to covet more. When they can &s;tore provi&s;ions, they wi&s;h to collect them. They &s;ow grain about their dwellings, rai&s;e vegetables, and breed different kinds of animals, both for food and for labour.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate their &s;ub&s;tance increa&s;es; they have time upon their hands; are more &s;edentary, and communicate a great deal together. By &s;uch comunication they catch ideas from each other, and what they
<PB N="12" REF="15">
already po&s;&s;e&s;s furni&s;hes them with means to carry their ideas into execution. Fami|lies increa&s;e, in con&s;equence of their ea&s;e; and where there is &s;ufficient extent of ter|ritory, the &s;ociety is continually &s;preading. Each individual applies his genius to faci|litate his labour. The di&s;coveries of &s;ome, become a benefit to others; and, with the aid of the&s;e inventions, the labour of a few &s;upplies the wants of many.</P>
<P>Such as are unemployed in hu&s;bandry will not &s;traggle wide in &s;earch of new lands to cultivate. Attached to each other by the ties of friend&s;hip, parentage, and ha|bit, they will continue with their brethren, and &s;eek, by their genius and indu&s;try, to repay tho&s;e who furni&s;h them with &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t then a people, living &s;trangers to Luxury, and confining them&s;elves to the fir&s;t &s;imple gifts which Nature be&s;tows, living naked, without any &s;ettled habita|tion, without agriculture, continues ever, while it &s;o exi&s;ts, in the &s;ame &s;tate of weak|ne&s;s, indigence, and &s;tupidity; a more ac|tive people, &s;tudying to improve their &s;itua|tion,
<PB N="13" REF="16">
becomes daily more and more enlight|ened, and are con&s;tantly gathering &s;trength and wealth, &s;o long as moral cau&s;es do not impede their progre&s;s. Hence then occurs the following plain rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>The idea of building a hou&s;e, and that of rai&s;ing plants for food, are dictated by that natural in&s;tinct, which leads man to profit by his genius, employing it to procure him&s;elf conveniences. From the&s;e fir&s;t ideas flow a thou&s;and others, as a con&s;equence of the &s;ame principle, and altogether produce the formation of great &s;ocieties and their power. Hence ari&s;e arts, manufactures, trades, and all the luxuries of life, that con&s;titute the &s;trength and power of a nation.</P>
<P>To rea&s;on clo&s;ely, gilded cielings, bronzes, porcelain, are, in fact, no more Luxuries than &s;hoes or &s;tockings. In Poland, in Hungary, and in &s;ome parts of Scotland, the pea&s;antry, in common, cover not their feet or legs with any thing; whenever they do, it is by way of dre&s;s, as white gloves are worn by us. Men and women there take long journeys barefooted, even at times when the country is covered with
<PB N="14" REF="17">
&s;now. All is relative. Shoes, to a per&s;on who never wore any, are a very <HI>trouble|&s;ome</HI> &s;uperfluity. A precious va&s;e upon a chimney-piece, is an <HI>agreeable</HI> &s;uperfluity. Ornaments that decorate the hou&s;e, the clothes, or the furniture, of the rich, are per|haps le&s;s &s;uperfluities to them, than the money would be with which they purcha&s;e them, if they had no other u&s;e to convert it to.</P>
<P>It is idle to talk of one thing being more a Luxury than another. All &s;uperfluities are Luxuries; and what is not immediately nece&s;&s;ary, is &s;uperfluous; of cour&s;e, eveyr thing that is not e&s;&s;ential to our exi&s;tence, is a Luxury. He, who, not finding him&s;elf at ea&s;e, when &s;leeping on the ground, con|trived to weave the fir&s;t mat of ru&s;hes for his repo&s;e, con&s;ulted his indulgence as much as he who &s;ince compo&s;ed the bed of down. They each made u&s;e of tho&s;e ma|terials they could get. It was circum&s;tance only that prevented the one, as well as the other, from accompli&s;hing the object of his wi&s;hes.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="18">If I may, without Luxury, cover my&s;elf with a &s;heep-&s;kin, merely cut and made in|to a form to fit me, and enable me to u&s;e my limbs; if I may, al&s;o, without being re|proached with Luxury, carry my ingenuity further, and make me a coat with the wool of this animal, coar&s;ely &s;pun; do I de&s;erve to be called luxurious, if I &s;pin this wool finer, weave it better, and clothe my&s;elf with a better kind of &s;tuff? I make u&s;e only of my abilities and my under&s;tanding to an&s;wer my intentions in the be&s;t man|ner po&s;&s;ible, which is to clothe my&s;elf con|veniently and comfortably. As &s;oon then as I am allowed to make u&s;e of art, be it ever &s;o little, to procure me any one enjoy|ment; upon what principles would they prohibit my employing all the art, of which I am capable? Would they alledge that Luxury con&s;i&s;ts in cleverne&s;s of execution?</P>
<P>And, if I may, without Luxury, make u&s;e of the wool, a part of one animal, I may, equally, without incurring reproach, employ the parts of any other animal, or any thing convertible into clothes, whether it be goats-beard, flax, cotton, or &s;ilk.
<PB N="16" REF="19">
The&s;e materials bear all the &s;ame rank in nature; and when I can obtain them, I may indifferently u&s;e them as I plea&s;e; one is, in it&s;elf, no more a Luxury than another. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of every thing I u&s;e. The materials of which a thing is made, are no more a Luxury than the thing it&s;elf. Gold and lead, diamonds and flints, are productions of the earth intrin&s;ically equal. My choice only is reprehen&s;ible or not, according as the qualities of the materials I u&s;e, an&s;wer or not an&s;wer my intentions. In con&s;idering things ab&s;olutely, there is no other rule to go by.</P>
<P>If, then, u&s;eful inventions, and tho&s;e that are merely plea&s;urable, partake (as is evident they do) of the &s;ame principle; if all things that are not immediately nece&s;|&s;ary, are Luxuries, it is ridiculous to con|demn either this or that; a manufacture of the mo&s;t trifling article is not without its advantage to the &s;tate, as it tends to cre|ate that di&s;bur&s;ement from which the &s;tate draws it re&s;ources, and employs a number of hands.</P>
<P>He that would have the mo&s;t frivolous toy, or the mo&s;t u&s;eful piece of furniture,
<PB N="17" REF="20">
cannot acquire either one or the other, but by his own labour, or by paying for the labour of a workman. If he makes the thing him&s;elf, whether it be u&s;eful or fri|volous, he mu&s;t be precedently provided with &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, or &s;upply, for his other nece&s;&s;ary wants, during the time he is at work. If he borrows the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of ano|ther, he mu&s;t feed, and &s;upply the wants of that other, during the time he employs him, or give him an equivalent for his trouble. In both the&s;e ca&s;es, no time is employed that is &s;ubtracted from nece&s;&s;ary want. The two inhabitants are &s;upported, the taxes are paid, and the produce of this labour, be it of what kind it will, equally augments the &s;tock of national wealth. Unnece&s;&s;ary things bear a price, as well as things of u&s;e.</P>
<P>Further, it generally happens, that, in the fabrication of a frivolous thing, the maker gets a living, which perhaps he could not otherwi&s;e do; and the purcha&s;er an enjoy|ment, which he would not otherwi&s;e have. Be&s;ides, in making this bauble, the arti&s;t, perhaps, exerci&s;es a talent, which, one day or other, may be applied to more u&s;eful
<PB N="18" REF="21">
purpo&s;es. The toyman, for example, who makes dolls of <HI>papier mache&eacute;</HI> to-day, &s;hall, if required, make in&s;trument-ca&s;es, and boxes of the &s;ame materials to-morrow. He knows how to &s;et about it.</P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e, for a moment, that &s;uper|fluities or unnece&s;&s;ary things were prohi|bited or unknown; and let us &s;uppo&s;e, which is by no means the truth, that every man had ground to till. In this ca&s;e, the active man, who, by the fruits of his la|bour, would be in a &s;ituation to procure him&s;elf &s;uperfluities, but having no &s;uch de|&s;ire, and not knowing what to do with the product of his labour, would work no long|er. The man al&s;o who&s;e profe&s;&s;ion it is to make &s;uperfluities, cultivates as much ground as &s;upplies him with food; and <HI>he</HI> works no more. Here now are two inhabitants merely &s;upported in a contrary hypothe&s;is; and how is the &s;tate affected by the change? Cultivation is not &s;o extended, and the va|lue of tho&s;e &s;uperfluities, which would otherwi&s;e have been made, is lo&s;t; for, the natural wants of man con&s;uming le&s;s than his labour will produce, if his &s;pare time
<PB N="19" REF="22">
be not employed in nece&s;&s;ary articles, the benefit of his time mu&s;t be lo&s;t to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>It is the &s;ame in gratifications, from which we draw nothing &s;ub&s;tantial; &s;uch as dancing, mu&s;ic, public exhibitions, and the like. Suppre&s;s the&s;e plea&s;ures, and let the men who are thus employed, bu&s;y them&s;elves in cultivation; what then? Tho&s;e before employed in hu&s;bandry would not have oc|ca&s;ion to work &s;o much; con&s;equently there would be no more hands employed in cul|tivation than before; nor any greater quan|tity of productions; and &s;ociety, at the &s;ame time, would have fewer arts, and le&s;s enjoy|ments.</P>
<P>Government might certainly, in many ca&s;es, employ the time and indu&s;try of the people, in a more advantageous manner to the &s;tate, than by &s;uffering them to labour for the produce of unnece&s;&s;ary things: but, if Government has no employ to &s;et them about, (and the time mu&s;t come when Government cannot employ every indivi|dual unengaged in hu&s;bandry or nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s), or if Government does not employ them, after men have provided for their
<PB N="20" REF="23">
natural wants, if &s;uperfluities are prohibited, they will be idle. On the contrary, if Luxu|ries are encouraged, whatever be the object on which the&s;e men employ their &s;pare time, it cannot but turn to the advantage of the nation, &s;ince the object they covet mu&s;t be acquired by work.</P>
<P>Work, if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, is a &s;econd creator. Without the form which this gives to matter, almo&s;t all that infinity of productions, with which the earth teems, would be lo&s;t to us. Surrounded with a thou&s;and po&s;&s;ible benefits, we &s;hould wear out our days bereft of all.</P>
<P>A nation can no way multiply its po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions, be rich or powerful, nor can it any|way be pro&s;perous, but through the labour of the people. The great object, then, in admini&s;tration, is to encourage and reward indu&s;try. No matter what the object be that incites it. Not even trifles can be produced, but by that u&s;eful labour which adds to the &s;trength of a &s;tate. There would be no mu&s;icians, mountebanks, or makers of toys, unle&s;s men gained a livelihood by &s;uch pro|fe&s;&s;ions. The&s;e men mu&s;t be fed, and they
<PB N="21" REF="24">
are fed by the labour of others, in return for the amu&s;ements they afford. Provi|&s;ions therefore produced by the&s;e objects do not exi&s;t the le&s;s, becau&s;e the objects are frivolous; and as provi&s;ions cannot be pro|duced, but by cultivation of land, it follows, that mu&s;icians, mountebanks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are pro|portionally in&s;trumental to cultivation. Like the min&s;trels of old, who were employ|ed by lords of manors to divert the copy|holders whil&s;t they were at work for them. As mu&s;ic enlivens the &s;pirits, and encrea&s;es activity, where is the impropriety of one man's &s;aying to another, on condition that you will pipe to me whil&s;t I am employed, I will do your work as well as my own. Without &s;uch an incitement, a man would abate in his exertions, and he would work only for him&s;elf. Be&s;ides, the&s;e men &s;o fed, and the&s;e provi&s;ions that feed them, may be otherwi&s;e employed, as circum&s;tances may require; and it is no &s;mall advantage to a &s;tate, to have a number of men in re&s;erve; for, by the doctrine before advanced, plen|ty of provi&s;ions naturally increa&s;es popula|tion; and as occa&s;ional inclination to &s;pend
<PB N="22" REF="25">
money in amu&s;ements, idle as it may ap|pear, encourages work, this work multi|plies provi&s;ions, promotes population, and augments the wealth of individuals; &s;o that &s;ociety not only has a re&s;erve of men to an&s;wer particular purpo&s;es, but the public taxes are more cheerfully paid; for if a man's taxes amount to ten pounds, his con|tribution is le&s;s felt, if he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;ixty pounds, than if he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed only thirty.</P>
<P>We are too apt to annex the idea of Luxu|ry to articles which indulge a &s;en&s;ual grati|fication, to things of ornament and magni|ficence, to the delicacies of the table, and certain peculiar indulgences; but this is begging the que&s;tion. I have already prov|ed, that whatever is not immediately nece&s;|&s;ary to our exi&s;tence, is a Luxury; and if a Luxury is not condemnable in one ca&s;e, it is not in another; I &s;peak now, as to Luxu|ries in general; there may be indeed cer|tain &s;pecies of Luxuries that may injure the morals of a community, and to this the Legi&s;lative power &s;hould advert; but this is no argument for condemning Luxuries in the gro&s;s, &s;ince it is by Luxury alone that any &s;tate can exi&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="26">We do not reflect, that when the fir&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;aries of life are &s;upplied, man is in want of things that give plea&s;ure, as much as any other; and that the&s;e articles which re|fre&s;h him, are, probably, le&s;s &s;uperfluous than a great number of inventions that are merely u&s;eful. The wine a man drinks can, perhaps, le&s;s be di&s;pen&s;ed with, than the watch in his pocket. That which plea&s;es, intere&s;ts as much as that which is u&s;eful. There is no di&s;&s;ipation or corruption in this: both are equally good in their place. A gold enamelled box, which a variety of arts combine to embelli&s;h, is not, indeed, &s;o u&s;e|ful as a clock; it is equally u&s;eful, how|ever, with a ro&s;e or a tulip, who&s;e form and richne&s;s of colouring enrapture the eye. Plea&s;ure is a real good. Nature would make us &s;en&s;ible of it, and with this view, &s;he has taken care to adorn her works. Was the earth without flowers, without verdure, to produce only fruits, would human beings, in its dreary &s;urface, robbed of the odorife|rous per&s;umes and enchanting &s;cenes of &s;pring, lo&s;e nothing? Would they have nothing to regret?</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="27">Tho&s;e who declaim again&s;t Luxury &s;eem wilfully blind. They call nothing Luxuries, that is of any &s;tanding; this cen&s;ure falls only on modern inventions and refine|ments; they cannot be made to &s;ee, that what they permit as u&s;eful and allowable, is of the &s;ame nature with that they con|demn; nor will they reflect, that &s;uch things as e&s;cape their cen&s;ure now, were, at the time they were fir&s;t made, and, according to their principles, ought to be, as much cla&s;&s;|ed among Luxuries, as things they now pro&s;cribe. They will not &s;ee that the mo|dern improvements they condemn, are the natural con&s;equence of perfection in the arts, and the progre&s;s of the mind and ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Men have always carried Luxury to the highe&s;t pitch they could. Want of means, or knowledge, was the only thing that &s;top|ped them. If we build our hou&s;es more magni&s;icently, ornament them more &s;uperb|ly, and make them more convenient than was done five hundred years ago, it is, be|cau&s;e we have found out, that it is better &s;o to do, and becau&s;e the progre&s;s of arts enable us to do it. It is on the &s;ame prin|ciple,
<PB N="25" REF="28">
that we widen our &s;treets, and pave them better.</P>
<P>Say not, that Luxury is injurious to a people: ca&s;t your eyes over the face of the world, and take the nations in review. Tho&s;e people where you find the greate&s;t Luxury, are the mo&s;t powerful. England, France, Italy hold, doubtle&s;s, the fir&s;t rank in Europe, and the&s;e are the countries where Luxury reigns in her greate&s;t glory. What renown for power and grandeur did the ancient people of A&s;ia, &s;o famous for their Luxury, acquire? A&s;ia, even now, in &s;pite of the de&s;tructive effects of tho&s;e govern|ments that are there e&s;tabli&s;hed, pre&s;erves &s;till a degree of Luxury. How much does it eclip&s;e both Africa and the greate&s;t part of America, who&s;e unfortunate inhabitants are acquainted with &s;carce any thing be|yond the fir&s;t nece&s;&s;aries of life!</P>
<P>It may be objected, that a thir&s;t for Luxu|ries, in augmenting the de&s;ires and expences of each individual, nece&s;&s;arily augments the price of labour throughout all cla&s;&s;es of men; that, of cour&s;e, the &s;tate is under a nece&s;&s;ity of paying higher &s;alaries to its of|ficers,
<PB N="26" REF="29">
and encrea&s;ing its pen&s;ions; and that &s;uch a &s;urcharge of expence, undermining it by degrees, mu&s;t end in its ruin. This is ea&s;ily an&s;wered. That a de&s;ire for Luxu|ries increa&s;es the price of labour, is very true; but this increa&s;e of price does not ari&s;e from an augmentation of our de&s;ires and wants, but from an increa&s;e of wealth brought about by the encouragement thus given to indu&s;try, and that &s;pur to work, which is the &s;ource of almo&s;t all our riches. If then, through the exi&s;tence of Luxury, Government is obliged to pay a greater price, it has al&s;o more re&s;ources to pay it from. Its expences and re&s;ources are pro|portioned to each other, and the State gains by Luxury, in becoming more happy and more powerful.</P>
<P>In rea&s;oning from facts, on a principle of politics, we mu&s;t take care not to attribute to Luxury, evils which flow only from a defect in that government, where &s;uch facts are ob&s;erved. The preten&s;ions of officers in any &s;tate, can never force it to pay greater &s;alaries than it is capable of doing, or than its natural means will admit of. An oeco|nomy
<PB N="27" REF="30">
founded on rea&s;on, and modified by circum&s;tances, &s;hould pre&s;ide over the pub|lic expences. It is not nece&s;&s;ary that for a hundred &s;heep there &s;hould be fifty &s;hep|herds; nor that an impolitic financier, prodi|gal of the public money, &s;hould be at liberty to tax the people at his will to &s;upport tho&s;e &s;hepherds. That Luxury favours the pro|&s;perity of States is evident; but this is, pro|vided the con&s;titution of the government there e&s;tabli&s;hed, does not de&s;troy its u&s;eful influence.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that Luxury renders men venal, robs them of their public &s;pirit, and di&s;po&s;es them to become &s;laves. This I de|ny. Men never &s;ell them&s;elves, but when there are proper purcha&s;ers. Suppre&s;s the abilities of the corrupter, and they will con|tinue uncorrupted in the mid&s;t of the great|e&s;t Luxury. On the contrary, whoever has many favours to be&s;tow, and is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of great power, will turn them to his ad|vantage, whether men are luxurious or not. It is not Luxury that corrupts mankind; they are naturally corrupt from di&s;po&s;ition, and when &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, would as &s;oon devote
<PB N="28" REF="31">
them&s;elves to another for a mere livelihood, as for great &s;ums of money. Sp. Maelius in Rome a&s;pired to the throne. He gain|ed one half the people by the corn he di&s;|tributed; and had it not been for the acti|vity of the Senate, who di&s;covered this pro|ject, the Romans, &s;o jealous of their liberty, would have lo&s;t it from that hour.</P>
<P>The &s;ame rea&s;oning will hold good among our&s;elves. If the vices of admini&s;tration did not, by &s;ecret pen&s;ions and other re|wards, enable gentlemen to purcha&s;e their &s;eats in parliament, there would be no &s;eats to be purcha&s;ed. Time was, when we were obliged to court gentlemen to repre&s;ent us, and even pay them for their attendance; but &s;ince a corrupt &s;y&s;tem of politics has in|troduced venality into parliament, the very electors them&s;elves will not give their votes without a reward.</P>
<P>Public &s;pirit &s;eldom gives way in the members of a State, but when men derive no advantage from &s;uch &s;pirit; and we do not renounce liberty, but when we de&s;pair of pre&s;erving it. It is not Luxury that gives birth to the&s;e unfortunate di&s;po&s;itions: they
<PB N="29" REF="32">
ari&s;e from a con&s;titution of government, where the rights of the people and the prince are all combined for the common intere&s;ts of both.</P>
<P>It is an error, therefore, to reproach Luxury with gradually gaining &s;uch an a&s;|cendency over minds, that are more con|&s;trained by obligations, or by nece&s;&s;ity, to be thus corrupt, than from any natural inclina|tions. If men devote them&s;elves to the &s;er|vice of others, it is becau&s;e they are &s;o cir|cum&s;tanced that they cannot avoid it. Should it be urged, that the unnece&s;&s;ary ex|pences we enter into, lead us into &s;uch &s;itua|tions; I do aver, that the&s;e extra expences are ultimately owing to the con&s;titution of a State. Spending of money, through mere o&s;tentation, can never be general, but in a country where the law bends under the powerful, and is &s;trong only again&s;t the weak; where favour decides all; where we cannot hope to obtain any thing, through equity, merit, or rea&s;on &s;olely; and where money chiefly opens the gates to honours, to dignities, and to high offices. We &s;ee, then, that it is not Luxury that rules, even
<PB N="30" REF="33">
when we give the greate&s;t way to it; we are led on by very different motives, by views of vanity, ambition, and fortune, and even, in many ca&s;es, by the &s;imple view of &s;upporting the &s;ituation we are in. Where men are re&s;pected according to the appearance they make, they will endeavour to make the be&s;t appearance they can.</P>
<P>In Switzerland and Holland, we nowhere &s;ee that ridiculous extravagance, re&s;ulting from a &s;umptuous out&s;ide, with poverty and mi&s;ery beneath it. Expences there are more judiciou&s;ly di&s;tributed. And why? Men are not there formed of a different nature. They have not a finer di&s;cernment in that which truly con&s;titutes their happine&s;s; and if we e&s;timate the general expence of the whole inhabitants of the&s;e countries, we &s;hall find that each &s;pends in conveniencies, in &s;uperfluities, in &s;hort in luxuries, a good deal more than do tho&s;e people whom we think we are ju&s;tifiable in re|proaching with being extravagantly luxu|rious. The good conduct of the Swi&s;s and the Dutch in this matter, is cleared up by the political con&s;titution of their countries.
<PB N="31" REF="34">
No degree of de&s;poti&s;m is there known. Offices are not venal. The rigor of the laws, and the determination of appointments, are not in proportion there to credit, and the reputation of being rich. A man may become poor among them, without any dan|ger to his &s;afety or his advancement. In whatever place it be, where other manners reign, with another form of government, it would be idle to attempt a reformation of tho&s;e manners, by the voice of exhortation, until a change took place in its political con&s;titution.</P>
<P>But men, &s;ay the adver&s;aries of Luxury, enter thus into expences they cannot afford. Who can determine this? What is more fluctuating, or more unknown, than the for|tunes of individuals? What is more vari|able than the u&s;e made of the&s;e fortunes? You tax a man with Luxury for running into certain expences, becau&s;e you &s;uppo&s;e his circum&s;tances will not admit of them: they <HI>do</HI> however admit of them, of cour&s;e they mu&s;t be more con&s;iderable than you imagine; or, perhaps, the man &s;aves it in &s;ome articles, to &s;pend it upon others, and thus puts him&s;elf in a &s;ituation to gratify
<PB N="32" REF="35">
him&s;elf in tho&s;e objects you condemn. When a man enters into expences of Luxury, the fact proves, that, for the moment, he is enabled to do it. He is certainly without reproach, if his expences do not tend to injure his fortune. If they do, it is not his de&s;ire for Luxuries that ought to be con|demned, but his mi&s;conduct. He would be equally to blame, if he hurt his fortune by any other expences, or even idlene&s;s. Such &s;teps would equally reduce him to the &s;itua|tion of tho&s;e who ruin them&s;elves by Luxury; becau&s;e, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, a man is more expen&s;ive than he ought to be. His fault is, not &s;pending his money upon any particular object, but &s;pending, in the whole, more than he can afford. But this, though an injury to him&s;elf, is not &s;o to the &s;tate, on which the pre&s;ent que&s;tion only hangs.</P>
<P>As little as we are accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider things in a general way, we know that one individual cannot injure his fortune, nor render him&s;elf reprehen&s;ible for his ex|pences, without enriching, or at lea&s;t giv|ing bread, by this means, to other indivi|duals. We know that the&s;e expences, what|ever
<PB N="33" REF="36">
they are, being entered into in &s;ociety, go, if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf, merely from the left-hand to the right, and do no injury to the body politic.</P>
<P>There is no doubt, but that the gratifi|cations of Luxury, as far as they tend to injure individuals, may, with &s;ome founda|tion, be condemned from the pulpit, and by &s;uch writers as undertake to advi&s;e mankind for their private good <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such is the Author of a tract that has run through many editions, called, <HI>The Way to be Rich and Re&s;pectable;</HI> containing, among other things, a variety of e&s;timates of family expences, adapted to every one's circum|&s;tances, &s;hewing, how comfortably people may live upon a little with oeconomy.</NOTE>. Luxury, di&s;pro|portioned to a man's fortune in life, is cer|tainly blameable; nay, though proportion|ed to his fortune, it is &s;till reprehen&s;ible, when the expences it leads him into, and the indulgences he gives way to, carry him beyond the proper bounds of decency and moderation.</P>
<P>But what is vicious in the&s;e two ca&s;es, does not intere&s;t the body politic, and is not injurious, but to tho&s;e individuals on
<PB N="34" REF="37">
whom &s;uch cen&s;ure ju&s;tly falls. Policy, which &s;ees nothing but in the aggregate, is not affected by any &s;mall number of parti|cular inconveniences. She does not feel the folly of a citizen, who&s;e Luxury has ruined his affairs, and provoked the public cen&s;ure. She finds in a general &s;pirit of Luxury, a principle to encourage labour, and in labour, a fund of riches and enjoy|ments, without end; from whence re&s;ult the power of the State, and the happine&s;s of its &s;ubjects. Luxury, &s;ays Melon <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Political E&s;&s;ays on Commerce, chap. 9.</NOTE>, is an idle term, which would bani&s;h every operation of policy and commerce, it carrying with it fal&s;e, vague, and confu&s;ed ideas, who&s;e abu&s;e tends to check indu&s;try in its &s;ource.</P>
<P>A &s;pirit of Luxury, continually labouring to create new plea&s;ures and furni&s;h new conveniences, begets indeed a great many frivolous things; but how &s;educing &s;oever this de&s;ire for frivolous things may be &s;up|po&s;ed, we have no rea&s;on to fear that it will &s;o invade a whole nation, as to make them madly neglect the u&s;eful and truly conve|nient,
<PB N="35" REF="38">
in order to dedicate their whole time, pains, and indu&s;try, to procure them&s;elves trifles. We &s;hall never &s;ee a per&s;on de|prive him&s;elf of bread to purcha&s;e baubles for his chimney-piece; nor go without &s;hoes, to adorn him&s;elf with lace. Trifles have no attraction, but with people who know no want.</P>
<P>The wretched &s;ituation of numbers abounding in wealth and indulgences, mi|litates again&s;t Luxury, and leads us to con|&s;ider it as debauchery. We become an|gry, to &s;ee whole families langui&s;hing un|der the want of nece&s;&s;aries, whil&s;t others are &s;quandering their &s;ub&s;tance in plea&s;ures, trifles, and o&s;tentation. Why, &s;ay we, &s;hould man, &s;tanding by birth upon a na|tural equality, experience &s;o different a lot? Our &s;en&s;ibility &s;hakes our judgment. We &s;everely reproach the wealthy with their enjoyments, as if the&s;e enjoyments were taken from the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the poor; and as if the poor would not feel equal di&s;tre&s;s, were the rich to bury their trea&s;ures. Whil&s;t we are touched with commi&s;eration for the unfortunate, who groan under the &s;courge
<PB N="36" REF="39">
of poverty, we &s;hould not &s;uffer our feelings to &s;hut our eyes again&s;t the inju&s;tice of tho&s;e who complain.</P>
<P>The pro&s;perity of a State nece&s;&s;arily de|pends upon right of property. If the enjoyment of the fruit of my indu&s;try, if my &s;avings, my acqui&s;itions are not &s;ecured to me in the mo&s;t &s;acred manner, &s;o that they are fully and wholly at my own di&s;|po&s;al, my emulation dies away, and I &s;hould cea&s;e to work, where I reap no profit. What|ever u&s;e the owner may make of his reve|nue or his gains, he does not enjoy it at the expence of another. If he hoards, his pro|perty is of no u&s;e to any one but him&s;elf; if he &s;pends, that is to &s;ay, if he indulges him&s;elf in Luxury, then, every agent he em|ploys for his gratifications, receives part of his fortune, in the &s;ums of money he pays. In di&s;tributing his income thus, he is far more beneficial to the State, than if, forgetting him&s;elf, he &s;hould di&s;po&s;e of it in acts of beneficence. The&s;e men on whom his liberality would fall, would con&s;ume it, without producing any thing; whereas the
<PB N="37" REF="40">
produce of tho&s;e who worked for him, would continue after the con&s;umption of their pay, and be of &s;ome value.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, in the latter ca&s;e, the &s;tate would contain every where men ver&s;ed in the practice of the arts, in&s;tead of u&s;ele&s;s men, who know not how to turn their hands to any thing. Emulation, diffu&s;ed among workmen, animates their indu&s;try; a variety of inventions &s;prings from their efforts; the mind gathers knowledge and powers; progre&s;&s;ion takes place; and &s;o|ciety gains in a thou&s;and ways, by the con|currence of &s;o many effects.</P>
<P>But the utility of Luxury in men of property, is not confined to the emulation &s;pread among workmen, who have only to depend upon their labour. A de&s;ire for Luxuries begets a love of property, makes a man attentive to the pre&s;ervation of his wealth, puts him upon the &s;earch of means to improve his income, excites others to the &s;ame by his example, and will not &s;uf|fer any order of men to vegetate in idle|ne&s;s. Without &s;uch a &s;pur as a de&s;ire for Luxuries occa&s;ions, many, perhaps, &s;en&s;ible
<PB N="38" REF="41">
of no want, would &s;leep over their wealth, and turn it to little or no advantage.</P>
<P>What is it that &s;upports this country but its Luxuries? Were &s;umptuary laws e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, or the &s;uperfluities of life taxed &s;o high, as to render men of &s;mall fortune un|able to procure them, Government would defeat its own views, and the intere&s;t of the national debt would be unpaid. Were we to con&s;ider well the va&s;t &s;ums of money which the Luxuries of life bring into the Public Trea&s;ury, it would &s;oon &s;hew the impolicy of any &s;tep towards their extinc|tion. Half the revenues of this country ari&s;es from duties on articles not imme|diately nece&s;&s;ary to the exi&s;tence, or even the happine&s;s, of the people, &s;uch as wine, &s;pirits, beer, tobacco, tea, &s;ugar, gla&s;s, china, pictures, wheels, po&s;t-chai&s;es, men &s;ervants, new&s;papers, and a thou&s;and others that could be very well di&s;pen&s;ed with. But on the encouragement of Luxuries, the riches of a kingdom depend; it not only enables a &s;tate to provide for its internal defence, to extend its territories, and aug|ment its commerce; but, contrary to a re|ceived
<PB N="39" REF="42">
opinion, it tends to increa&s;e popula|tion, as I have already &s;hewn, and in which the wealth and &s;trength of a nation has long been allowed to con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>But, after all, What is the inconvenience attending Luxury, that it is &s;o much de|cried? I have corn and wine, more than I can con&s;ume. Their quantity puts me to an expence to keep it. It is a &s;uperfluity that encumbers me. I exchange it for a &s;uperfluity I wi&s;h for, the enjoyment of which rewards my labours, and &s;timulates my emulation. How, then, would you have me di&s;po&s;e of this &s;uperfluity? Give it to the indigent, who are in want of &s;u&s;|tenance? I do &s;o; but, in&s;tead of giving it to an idle pauper, one without talents, and whom charity has rendered of little u&s;e to &s;ociety, I give it to per&s;ons who, relying upon trade or indu&s;try for &s;upport, have no occa&s;ion to &s;toop to others for their bread. They eat it without humiliation. They have earned it. It is their own. Be&s;ides, in giving it to &s;uch people, I &s;erve the State, by the taxes their labour produces,
<PB N="40" REF="43">
whil&s;t, at the &s;ame time, I am &s;erving <HI>them.</HI></P>
<P>Luxury is accu&s;ed of decrea&s;ing popula|tion; that Luxury, which &s;upports &s;o many families, which invites &s;o many workmen to marry, by the ea&s;e they ac|quire in exchange for their indu&s;try. Let us turn our thoughts, for a moment, to the negroes, to the &s;avages of Loui&s;iana.&mdash; Luxury does not devour the&s;e people; and yet, are they numerous? On the other hand, how populous was Spain under the dominion of the Moors, and yet what peo|ple were ever more brave, or more luxu|rious?</P>
<P>So far from Luxury's depopulating a State, if there be any thing to fear from it, it is that it will introduce an enormous population. It is the fate of &s;ublunary things to fall away by the very cau&s;es that promoted their progre&s;s. The &s;ources of the pro&s;perity of a State corrupt it in the end, where a prudent admini&s;tration does not direct and conduct its cour&s;e. Emula|tion, produced by Luxury, and by the &s;e|curity of property, gives birth to a prodigi|ous
<PB N="41" REF="44">
abundance, and from this abundance &s;prings a &s;till more prodigious population; the number of the human race in a country being always in proportion, as was before ob&s;erved, to the productions which that country furni&s;hes for the u&s;e of man. Of cour&s;e, if no &s;teps are taken to prevent an exce&s;s of population, it becomes an evil.</P>

Nece&s;&s;ity compels it. Men become crafty, &s;ubtle, and fraudulent. The mind is enervated, as the &s;pirits relax: and a na|tion, which had rai&s;ed it&s;elf to the highe&s;t degree of power and happine&s;s, is no more, by a natural concatenation of cau&s;es and effects, than a nation exceedingly numerous, &s;ordid, wretched, and low.

<P><PB N="42" REF="45">It is in this &s;en&s;e, only, that we can &s;ay with rea&s;on, that Luxury is dreadful: but here Providence &s;teps in again, and fre|quently interpo&s;es. May it not be owing to an interference of the Creator, that wars are kindled between neighbouring powers, as much to thin the number of the human &s;pecies, as for other purpo&s;es? If &s;o, a long war may, in the end, benefit a &s;tate, which exce&s;s of population might otherwi&s;e ruin.

May not their doctrine of prede&s;tination, which forbids them to fly from the pe&s;tilence, tend al&s;o to this end? May not emigrations al&s;o have the &s;ame tendency? But this is diving into cau&s;es beyond our reach to fathom: all that is nece&s;&s;ary to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e is, not to meet misfortunes half way, but to act as con&s;ummate prudence &s;hall direct, and leave the event to Heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="46">There are doubtle&s;s proper remedies to moderate exce&s;s of population, &s;o as to pre|vent any evil ari&s;ing from Luxury. The States of Switzerland lend out their troops to foreign nations, for hire; for that coun|try being improved to the highe&s;t degree of cultivation, after retaining a &s;ufficient num|ber of hands to keep it always in this con|dition, and for the &s;upport of every manu|factory, they deem it political, from the great &s;urplus of inhabitants, to allow their troops to go into foreign &s;ervices, le&s;t an exce&s;s of population &s;hould prove injurious to the nation. The&s;e troops, by &s;tipulation, may be recalled by the States on any emer|gency, which &s;ecures their internal defence. But how far is the re&s;t of Europe from hav|ing any thing to dread on this account! Would to God it was threatened with it!&mdash; Before Luxury can injure a people, it mu&s;t lead them to the very height of pro&s;perity, and it mu&s;t appear that no previous &s;teps have been taken, to render this pro&s;perity la&s;ting. Let us not he&s;itate then, to encou|rage Luxury, in &s;pite of the evil which a cour&s;e of time may draw with it. We think
<PB N="44" REF="47">
our&s;elves ju&s;tifiable in taking little or no ac|count of a future evil, which the actual &s;ituation of things place at an infinite di&s;|tance; which a thou&s;and new cau&s;es may di&s;&s;ipate for ever, and which can only be the re&s;ult of a very long pro&s;perity; for the ble&s;&s;ings of which, it is wi&s;e to run an uncertain chance of a &s;ub&s;equent injury.</P>
<P>The Luxury of a town is an inconte&s;tible proof of the opulence of its inhabitants. Luxury, &s;pread to the &s;malle&s;t hamlets of a kingdom, is a certain &s;ign that &s;uch king|dom enjoys the greate&s;t abundance. Luxury ever takes its level from the public pro&s;pe|rity. It is its thermometer. In vain do our de&s;ires lead us to enjoyments that pre|&s;ent them&s;elves, when our circum&s;tances will not permit us to embrace them. Our ex|pences are always confined to things within our reach. It is either my own property, or the property of others who entru&s;t me, that I con&s;ume.&mdash;In both the&s;e ca&s;es, it is ever &s;ome exi&s;ting property which enables me to purcha&s;e a Luxury. If I exceed my means, my part is &s;oon played. The di&s;&s;i|pation of my fortune is immediately &s;uc|ceeded
<PB N="45" REF="48">
by want and humiliation. Thus where Luxury reigns, there is certainly a degree of opulence proportionable to the extent of it. The aggregate of means may be greater than the con&s;umption, but it can|not be le&s;s. Whatever exce&s;s an individual may run into, he con&s;umes only things that exi&s;t, and things which would be con&s;umed by others, if they were not by him.</P>
<P>Why, then, be alarmed at Luxury, and con&s;ider it as a &s;courge, &s;ince a people can|not give way to it, but in proportion to their means? Is it not con&s;onant to rea&s;on, to in|dulge, where it can lawfully be done? Wealth would be of little or no advantage, were we forbidden to enjoy the comforts it brings. We &s;pend only in Luxuries, that which Government leaves, and, when its nece&s;&s;ary wants are &s;upplied, ought to leave. What inconveniencies, then, can a State feel, by its &s;ubjects expending that in the com|forts and indulgences of life, which it has no right to take from them, and which it could not take, without injuring it&s;elf?</P>
<P>That Luxury has been declaimed again&s;t for many ages, I allow, <HI>&s;oevior armis luxu|ria,</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="49">
is an old reproach. But men, however they may applaud invectives again&s;t it, have ever given into it, and to the utmo&s;t of their power. That good &s;en&s;e, with which na|ture has endowed them, keeps them from fol|lowing, in practice, the errors of &s;peculation. In all ages, men have indulged them&s;elves in Luxuries, fearle&s;s of the dangers they annexed to &s;uch a proclivity. Nay, though &s;ince the time of Juvenal, Luxury has ex|tended it&s;elf from Italy, to France, to Eng|land, and to Germany, the&s;e countries, al|mo&s;t de&s;erted in many places of old, are now very powerful States. Thus it appears, in oppo&s;ition to all opinions, that the happi|ne&s;s and pro&s;perity of men depend upon the indulgences of life, and that Luxury is by no means a political evil. <Q>That which nature loves,</Q> &s;ays Young, <Q>is nece&s;&s;ari|ly good.</Q> We do not con&s;ider, that every fetter with which we &s;hackle either trade or indu&s;try, is a &s;tep towards circum&s;cribing public pro&s;perity.

<P>A &s;pirit of Luxury may corrupt and di&s;|grace individuals.

Will you, like Mahomet, prohibit the u&s;e of wine, becau&s;e this &s;alutary drink intoxicates the intemperate?</P>
<P>The expenditure of Government is the only thing who&s;e exce&s;s can be detrimental to the State; becau&s;e the taxes Admini&s;tra|tion is obliged to levy, and which mu&s;t be paid, exceeding the proportion which the general circum&s;tances of the people can an|&s;wer without affecting them, rob them of
<PB N="48" REF="51">
their nece&s;&s;ary means of &s;upport, or of in|crea&s;ing their income, and is, therefore, a general di&s;couragement. Whereas the ex|pences of individuals, as exce&s;&s;ive as they may be with re&s;pect to them&s;elves, are al|ways confined to a certain circle; &s;o that the populace in general are not affected thereby.</P>
<P>If Luxury had a de&s;tructive effect, what would be the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things? Men, for &s;ome thou&s;ands years, have indulged them&s;elves in it, as far as they could. Their eagerne&s;s to do &s;o, never gives way, but when their means fail them. Though we, at this day, inveigh &s;o bitterly again&s;t the&s;e exce&s;&s;es, we &s;ee not among us &s;uch men as Lucullus and Apicius <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Romans famed for Luxury.</NOTE>. The mo&s;t &s;uperb buildings of the pre&s;ent age, do not reach the magnificence of the palace of Semira|mis, and our mo&s;t &s;tudied entertainments do not equal tho&s;e of Cleopatra. Neither London nor Paris know, either in common life or in public plea&s;ures, &s;uch refinements as were in general u&s;e in Babylon, Athens, and Rome, at the time of their &s;plendour.
<PB N="49" REF="52">
Even our ance&s;tors, as they grew wealthy, tho&s;e ance&s;tors of who&s;e &s;implicity we boa&s;t, were as fond of magnificence and &s;plendor as the Greeks and Romans.</P>
<P>In this country, people of moderate for|tune, in common life, covered their tables with a great variety of di&s;hes. Cloaths were rich to that degree, that, according to an ancient Chronicle, commencing in 1400 and ending in 1477, valets, in imitation of their ma&s;ters, and the lower cla&s;s of people, indifferently wore doublets of &s;ilk and velvet.</P>
<P>The Author of an Engli&s;h Tract, called <HI>a Plan of Trade,</HI> which ran through five editions in a very little time, propo&s;ed, as a means of augmenting the trade of this country, to &s;end mi&s;&s;ionaries to the Negroes and Savages of America, not to propagate the faith, but to induce them to clothe them|&s;elves, and in&s;pire them with a ta&s;te for Luxuries. His idea is, that if we could once bring them to adopt our cu&s;toms, they would apply them&s;elves more to work, in order to gratify their new de&s;ires; that they would unite them&s;elves more together, mul|tiply and become rich; that, of cour&s;e,
<PB N="50" REF="53">
there would be among them, a greater number of people in a &s;ituation to buy, and whom we might furni&s;h with a variety of articles. No one can deny this way of rea&s;oning to be ju&s;t, and that the effects which &s;uch a plan promi&s;es, would take place, could we bring the Savage nations to adopt our manners. Every one al&s;o mu&s;t allow, that Savages could not follow our modes of dre&s;s, build them&s;elves hou&s;es more commodious than their pre&s;ent cabbins, and furni&s;h them with conveniences, with|out &s;uch novelties being to them Luxuries; though, at the &s;ame time, the&s;e additional comforts and conveniences &s;hould not ex|ceed tho&s;e of our common pea&s;antry. In fact, Savages <HI>have</HI> reached the&s;e improve|ments; and as the Luxury into which they have entered, begins to enrich them, by in|ducing them to work, which is the &s;ource of all riches, how &s;hould Luxury have a con|trary effect among us, where the force of this rea&s;oning is much greater; as, with us, work of all kinds is more readily entered into, and meets with more encouragement,
<PB N="51" REF="54">
than among a people ju&s;t emerging from the primitive &s;tate of Nature?</P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e, for a while, that the great|e&s;t part of Luxuries was aboli&s;hed, and let us con&s;ider the effects of &s;uch a change. Men thenceforth would content them&s;elves with cabbins, who&s;e con&s;truction would re|quire no art, and the&s;e would be very &s;can|tily and very clum&s;ily furni&s;hed. They would clothe them&s;elves in &s;kins, and would have no uten&s;ils, but &s;uch as are immediate|ly nece&s;&s;ary.&mdash;From the moment they were re&s;trained in this point, half the inhabitants would be reduced to look out for new re|&s;ources; and tho&s;e who have e&s;tates in land, embarra&s;&s;ed with their incomes, would be at a lo&s;s how to &s;pend them. The arts being abandoned, an infinite quantity of dif|ferent materials would become of no value. Commerce would cea&s;e between country and country, between town and town; &s;hips of trade would be u&s;ele&s;s, and neither bu&s;ine&s;s nor intere&s;t would urge men to travel; of cour&s;e, roads would be neglected, and fall to ruin; communications would be ob&s;tructed; corre&s;pondence would cea&s;e; and, as in for|mer
<PB N="52" REF="55">
times, it would be a great undertaking to go forty miles to &s;ee a friend.</P>
<P>From this failure in the arts, from this failure in communication, ignorance and barbari&s;m would undoubtedly &s;pring. Hence, al&s;o, tho&s;e who are employed in hu&s;bandry, having fewer re&s;ources, and le&s;s knowledge, would attend le&s;s to their bu|&s;ine&s;s, and their harve&s;t, of cour&s;e, would be &s;maller. Each di&s;trict, thus confined, and limited to its own re&s;ources, would de|cline under the intemperature of &s;ea&s;ons, and famine, as in ancient times, would &s;talk abroad.</P>
<P>The nation, almo&s;t reduced for provi&s;ions to the harve&s;t of the year, and having neither money in &s;tore, nor any other wealth, would not be in a &s;ituation to pay for any thing but in kind or in labour. Hence the State would be under a nece&s;&s;ity of de|manding the per&s;onal &s;ervice even of land|holders, and hence would follow, as &s;ub&s;ti|tutes for them, the &s;ervitude or va&s;&s;alage of the lower cla&s;s of men, employed by the landholders, for want of re&s;pon&s;ible men to occupy their lands. This obligation of per|&s;onal
<PB N="53" REF="56">
&s;ervice would deprive the State of a &s;tanding army, and con&s;equently reduce its fate, in time of war, to the hazard of a &s;ingle battle.</P>
<P>In tracing the inevitable con&s;equences of an extinction of Luxury, we &s;hould find our&s;elves in the &s;ituation of our ance&s;tors, during the feudal &s;y&s;tem; when the lord's rents were paid in labour, and military &s;er|vices were performed in per&s;on. Wars were then carried on rather by excur&s;ions than regular campaigns; a &s;ingle defeat decided the fate of the vanqui&s;hed, and ig|norance and barbari&s;m were complete. Now, an extinction of Luxury, whether brought on by wars, by continual di&s;a&s;ters, or by pro|hibitory laws, would equally produce the &s;ame effects. It would de&s;troy emulation, put a &s;top to indu&s;try, annihilate wealth, and bring a country into the &s;ame &s;ituation, as would a poverty, cau&s;ed by the ravages of a continual inte&s;tine war, or the vices of a bad admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of other countries, be&s;ides our own, will &s;hew the &s;uperiority of &s;trength and power, which Luxury, and its
<PB N="54" REF="57">
offspring; the arts, give birth to in a nation, Cae&s;ar, with a &s;mall number of troops, in ten years &s;ubjected the Gauls, a brave and di&s;ciplined people, but who lived in the greate&s;t &s;implicity, and con&s;equently were not wealthy, or acquainted with the value of the arts. The Romans, then ma&s;ters of Gaul, carried Luxury from Italy into this new province. The country became rich and flouri&s;hing. The barbarians from Ger|many and the North, attracted by the opu|lence of the&s;e Gauls, poured in upon them like a deluge. But the&s;e being as &s;imple and as little luxurious as the ancient Gauls, they were repul&s;ed and kept back for three hundred years, without being able to obtain any other e&s;tabli&s;hment than as &s;ubjects of the empire; nor could they find a &s;overeignty there, till after they had taken up the arts and manners of the Romans.</P>
<P>Admini&s;trations are apt to think, that they have only to lay taxes upon the inha|bitants of a country, to oblige them to work. This was the &s;pirit of that device, which the council of finances e&s;tabli&s;hed by the regent of France in 1717, took for a coat of arms,
<PB N="55" REF="58">
<HI>viz.</HI> a plough furrowing a field, with the motto, <HI>&s;ecat et auget.</HI> But in this Governors are mi&s;taken: for, if they only leave cul|tivators in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of means &s;ufficient to carry on their hu&s;bandry and pay their taxes, they di&s;courage them, and in a little time taxes are not paid at all. To enable them to pay a tax, and to add to it from year to year, if occa&s;ion requires, care mu&s;t be taken to put no check to indu&s;try; which cannot be avoided any other way, than by leaving &s;uch per&s;ons a re&s;idue of their gains, at their own di&s;po&s;al, after the tax is paid, in order to &s;weeten their toils, reward their labour, and encourage them to proceed. Not only ju&s;tice and humanity require this, but policy. The productions of the earth are always in proportion to labour and indu&s;try. The hu&s;bandman however takes no pains, but as he hopes to reap a profit by his la|bour. What he con&s;umes him&s;elf of the produce of his lands, is not all that intere&s;ts him. His views are chiefly turned to the profits he &s;hall otherwi&s;e gain. To make a man work his whole life, merely to &s;upport his exi&s;tence, would be as bad as condemn|ing
<PB N="56" REF="59">
him for life to the galleys, or putting him on board the balla&s;t-lighters at Woolwich.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be &s;aid, that we ought to contract the &s;phere of our wants. Dio|genes taught us this. We enrich our&s;elves, according to him, in proportion as we learn to do without a great number of things. When it &s;hall be even true, that ab&s;tinence, with re&s;pect to the happine&s;s of individuals, is equally gratifying with enjoyments, and that we &s;hall gain more, by &s;aving our&s;elves the trouble of acquiring or pre&s;erving, than we &s;hould lo&s;e by renouncing the advan|tages of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, this philo&s;ophy will not be le&s;s irreconcilable with public intere&s;t; which requires that a State &s;hould be able to make it&s;elf re&s;pectable abroad as well as at home.</P>
<P>In a nation accu&s;tomed to live upon a little, the wants of the State are almo&s;t the &s;ame, and co&s;t as much as in a nation where &s;uperfluities are admitted. Among the mo&s;t luxurious people, as well as among tho&s;e who are lea&s;t &s;o, &s;oldiers and &s;ailors, employed by the State, are paid nearly alike; that is to &s;ay, at as low a rate as po&s;&s;ible, &s;o
<PB N="57" REF="60">
as to afford them exi&s;tence. The &s;ame works require the &s;ame quantity of mate|rials; and if the conductors of public un|dertakings are better paid by a luxurious people, the a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;uch a people derive from the arts which flouri&s;h among them, counterbalances the extraordinary &s;ums paid, and, upon a calculation, renders the expence le&s;s to them, than it would be to a le&s;s luxurious, and of cour&s;e a poorer na|tion, though paying &s;maller &s;ums of money. A nation, then, who&s;e individuals contract their expences, and abridge their con&s;ump|tion, advances as much to the public wants, as a nation who&s;e individuals live with le&s;s frugality. Hence it is, that among a people who mortify them&s;elves, by denying them|&s;elves indulgences, the public expences can|not be adequate to the wants of the State, without being exce&s;&s;ive in compari&s;on to the wants of individuals; and that the exce&s;s of the&s;e public charges prevents &s;uch a na|tion providing for the wants of the State, agreeable to the nece&s;&s;ity of circum&s;tances; and con&s;equently the State mu&s;t continue
<PB N="58" REF="61">
weak, contemptible, and &s;ubject to the inva|&s;ion of the fir&s;t aggre&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>It will probably be objected, that the charges of the State, though exce&s;&s;ive in proportion to the wants of individuals, not being in reality heavier than they rea&s;on|ably ought to be, a head of a family con|tributes more ea&s;ily to its &s;upport, when he &s;pends little upon him&s;elf and family, than when he &s;pends a great deal. To give &s;trength to this argument, it mu&s;t fir&s;t be proved, that men, who &s;carce wi&s;h for any indulgence, will exert them&s;elves, and en|crea&s;e their labour, without any other object than a very di&s;tant advantage, derived from the benefits the State acquires, and which is not very &s;en&s;ibly felt by individuals. He who &s;pends but little, comforts him&s;elf with an ea&s;y life, which, in his opinion, compen|&s;ates for the lo&s;s of every other enjoyment. It is not in human nature, to exert it&s;elf, and undergo fatigue, without a pro&s;pect of reward. This is a principle I have already explained, and which &s;hould not be lo&s;t &s;ight of.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="62">Let us admit, for a moment, contrary to all likelihood, that among a people living a rigid life, where Luxury is unknown, pa|triotic zeal, carried by education even to heroi&s;m, encourages them cheerfully to &s;upply the public wants, though exceeding in a great di&s;proportion the per&s;onal wants of the contributors. Even under this &s;up|po&s;ition, a nation, with manners &s;o re&s;pec|table, would &s;till want &s;olid &s;tability. A State cannot always fore&s;ee its nece&s;&s;ities. Accidental, unthought of wants ari&s;e. Sup|po&s;e there is a &s;ufficient &s;tore of arms, am|munition, and artillery. An enemy, in the cour&s;e of an unfortunate war, de&s;troys the magazines. Fire con&s;umes them. A thou|&s;and accidents may exhau&s;t them. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, then, what re&s;ource would a people have, that had reduced them&s;elves to this &s;imple life we have been &s;peaking of? None. They would not repair &s;uch lo&s;&s;es with that convenient expedition which the inhabitants of a country could, who, accu&s;|tomed to enjoy an ample &s;uperfluity, have &s;tores of materials of every kind. As they generally con&s;ume more than is nece&s;&s;ary,
<PB N="60" REF="63">
they can ea&s;ily &s;pare, in a ca&s;e of di&s;tre&s;s, &s;ufficient to &s;upply the nece&s;&s;ities of the State. And that which to each would be little or no deprivation, when collected from a whole community would prove an e&s;&s;en|tial a&s;&s;i&s;tance. On the contrary, in a coun|try who&s;e inhabitants con&s;ume but little, there is but little re&s;erve among individuals; and, as the inhabitants of this country con|fine their con&s;umption almo&s;t to things im|mediately nece&s;&s;ary, they have nothing to &s;pare. Thus, in &s;uch unfortunate and un|expected ca&s;es, which defeat all fore&s;ight, a nation who contracts its expences to the utmo&s;t, would find it&s;elf ill provided, and without means of defence. Whatever zeal, whatever courage we may &s;uppo&s;e it to have, it cannot avoid, in the end, being con|quered and de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Again, Luxury is charged with corrupt|ing the manners, degrading the &s;oul, &s;tifling of virtue, introducing a thou&s;and vices, and, by &s;uch effects, working the ruin of States. It is &s;aid, al&s;o, by the oppo&s;ers of Luxury, that the pre&s;ent race of men are not equal to what their ance&s;tors were, and that the
<PB N="61" REF="64">
human &s;pecies is degenerating. Now it is two thou&s;and years that this language has been held, and yet the experience of twenty centuries, which has given the lie to &s;uch declarations, has not been able to &s;top their mouths.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory, by no means, confirms &s;uch an opinion of Luxury. Let us look back and run through the la&s;t five centuries. From the year 1280 to the pre&s;ent time, Luxury has not cea&s;ed to be prevalent in France (I point to that country, as we &s;eem to draw our manners, as well as our fa&s;hions from thence;) and at certain periods, in this inter|val of time, with more profu&s;ion, than at this day. Since this, however, the French monarchy has certainly not dimini&s;hed its grandeur. No revolution has happened, for five hundred years pa&s;t, in any part of Europe, that we can, with any &s;hadow of truth, attribute to a depravation of manners occa&s;ioned by Luxury. If we except the taking of Con&s;tantinople by the Turks, and the expul&s;ion of the Moors from Spain, events who&s;e real cau&s;e, like tho&s;e of all other public events which we attribute to
<PB N="62" REF="65">
the effect of Luxury upon manners, have no relation to it whatever; if we except, I &s;ay, the&s;e two ca&s;es, the principal &s;tates that have divided Europe for five hundred years pa&s;t, continue &s;till to divide it, with little difference in their boundaries, notwith&s;tand|ing a very great degree of Luxury was in|troduced into &s;ome of the&s;e States before this epoch, and has continued there ever &s;ince. Where then is the deva&s;tation cau&s;ed by Luxury? And &s;ince, in &s;pite of its effects, for &s;o long a &s;pace of time, the&s;e great empires have nearly pre&s;erved the &s;ame ex|tent of territory, how can we maintain that a &s;pirit of Luxury alters the manners, &s;o as to be prejudicial to the pre&s;ervation of States? And it is even ob&s;ervable, that the mo&s;t powerful of tho&s;e empires are tho&s;e where Luxury has reigned the mo&s;t.</P>
<P>It has been often &s;aid that corruption of manners overthrew the Roman power; and it has been very wantonly &s;aid. Rome began to give way to Luxury one hundred and fifty years before the Chri&s;tian aera, yet, in &s;pite of a very corrupt form of government e&s;ta|bli&s;hed among the Romans by Augu&s;tus, the
<PB N="63" REF="66">
empire &s;upported it&s;elf, without any dimi|nution, three hundred years after the birth of Chri&s;t. It continued to exi&s;t in the we&s;t till the end of the year 476, and in the ea&s;t under the name of the Grecian Empire, to the year 1453. This duration, reckoning from the introduction of Luxury into Rome, is a &s;pace of 1600 years. How ab&s;urd is it then to quote empires as &s;eated upon ruin|ous foundations, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for &s;o long a time! The notion that Luxury was de|&s;tructive to the Roman power, took its ri&s;e from con&s;idering the revolution in Rome, under Julius Cae&s;ar, as the termination of the Roman empire. No &s;uch change, however, took place in its form of govern|ment then, as had frequently done before, &s;ince the time of Romulus.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if Luxury could ever be &s;uppo&s;ed to have injured the Roman power, which I cannot any way admit, the example will not hold good at pre&s;ent. The Romans were a warlike people, in&s;atiate for extent of empire, which could only be acquired by the &s;word. Indulgence, therefore, to a warrior, may naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed to enervate his
<PB N="64" REF="67">
arm, and make him le&s;s fit for enterprize, than when inured to danger and fatigue. So great was their thir&s;t for dominion, that no boundary would &s;erve them, but that of the whole world. They were a people bred up to arms, and from a &s;avage &s;tate, labour|ed to overrun the whole globe. Luxury, to &s;uch a people, might counteract their de|&s;igns; for growing le&s;s hardy and re&s;olute from indulgence, the barbarians from the north poured in upon them, and de&s;troyed them. The complexion and &s;y&s;tem of the times is very different now. <HI>Tempora mu|tantur, et nos mutamur in illis.</HI> Future ages may as well &s;ay, that it was the luxury of the Engli&s;h that lo&s;t them America. As the di&s;memberment of the Roman empire was chiefly owing to their va&s;t extent of terri|tory, too remote from its &s;eat, and too popu|lous to be controlled at &s;uch a di&s;tance; &s;o was the &s;eparation of North America from us. It were idle to &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;uch an extent of country, &s;o well peo|pled, and at &s;o great a di&s;tance, would continue long &s;ubject to the control of this i&s;land. Had not the event taken place now,
<PB N="65" REF="68">
it would certainly have done &s;o in le&s;s than half a century. But, to return to my &s;ubject, territory is, at this day, in a greater num|ber of hands; &s;tates are more divided, na|tions more civilized, and that hardy rough|ne&s;s of former ages, is not &s;o nece&s;&s;ary now. If a State has a &s;ufficient &s;oldiery to bear its part in the &s;cale of Europe, in propor|tion to its extent of domain, it requires no more. It is not the &s;y&s;tem of modern States to aim, as did the Romans, at extent of ter|ritory by conque&s;t. Their wi&s;h is only to enrich the country they at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;s, to render them&s;elves as powerful as their nature and &s;ituation will admit of, and to defend them&s;elves from encroachments; and if, at any time, they &s;tand in need of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, neighbouring States are ready to lend their aid, in order to pre&s;erve a balance of power, le&s;t any one State &s;hould become too powerful for the re&s;t. As things, there|fore, now &s;tand, any enervation of &s;avage &s;trength, any &s;oftne&s;s of manners brought on by Luxury, is &s;o far from being injuri|ous to States, that it renders them more civi|lized, more friendly, and more conformable
<PB N="66" REF="69">
to that mildne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, with which Providence hath humanized mankind.</P>
<P>On a &s;uppo&s;ition that the attraction of indulgences opening the bo&s;om to de&s;ire, di&s;po&s;es men to neglect their duty, and deadens the voice of con&s;cience, we &s;hould expect to find le&s;s virtue in a country where Luxury predominates, than where the people live a more &s;imple life; for, under this idea, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that in a nation living in a &s;imple manner, there are fewer objects ca|pable of inflaming de&s;ire, and con&s;equently fewer occa&s;ions where a wi&s;h for gratification carries men beyond the bounds they ought to keep. But the fact is not &s;o.</P>
<P>Let a nation live either &s;plendidly or poorly, it is equally expo&s;ed to tho&s;e di&s;or|ders which de&s;ire draws after it. Pa&s;&s;ions derive their &s;trength more from the di&s;po|&s;ition of the heart, than from the variety or value of tho&s;e things that inflame them. Envy, jealou&s;y, ambition, vanity, all the affections of the &s;oul that give birth to de|&s;ire, are alive to &s;mall objects, when great ones do not pre&s;ent them&s;elves. There was nothing rare, or of any great value in Lace|demon.
<PB N="67" REF="70">
The people there coveted trifles. Tarpeia, in the early time of Rome, that is to &s;ay, at the time when Rome was poor, delivered up the capital to the enemies of her country, for an object that would not here tempt any per&s;on of her rank.</P>
<P>All is comparative. What is nothing in one circum&s;tance, is every thing in another. A Negro Prince &s;ets as great a value on the feathers that encircle his head, as does the Mogul on the diamonds that decorate his throne.</P>
<P>Luxuries do not inflame de&s;ire, nor make us exceed the bounds pre&s;cribed, but when we covet or regret them, from a motive in|dependent of the plea&s;ures attached to the enjoyment. What is the motive that leads us to wi&s;h immediately for the means of living luxuriou&s;ly? The ambition of &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ing or equalling the &s;ituation of our fellow-citizens; of eclip&s;ing them, and thus obtaining a certain degree of credit; it is the fear of falling into contempt, and too often the danger that ari&s;es from not ap|pearing opulent. I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, but it is the misfortune, in the pre&s;ent age, to
<PB N="68" REF="71">
rate men, not &s;o much by their intrin&s;ic merits, as by the appearance they make in life; and as mo&s;t people covet the e&s;teem of the world, they, as I &s;aid before, endea|vour to make the be&s;t appearance they can, though, in order to make &s;uch appearance, they &s;pend more than they can afford. We covet not the favours of fortune, merely for the plea&s;ures of indulgence, but for the gratification of di&s;playing our wealth, and in many ca&s;es, for the pro&s;pect of encrea&s;|ing it. The covetous man, who &s;acrifices his honour, his repo&s;e, his every thing to the encrea&s;e of his riches, and who is then prodigal of the&s;e &s;ame riches in luxurious expences, is &s;carce ever a &s;en&s;ual man. Va|nity is the only thing that animates him, or the greedy hope of adding to his wealth, encrea&s;ing his power, and gaining autho|rity. It is not Luxury, but the &s;emblance of it.</P>
<P>Vanity acts upon the mind, in proportion to the object this pa&s;&s;ion has in view, and not according to the means we employ to gratify it. Thus, wherever vanity &s;prings, it has the &s;ame influence whether its object be
<PB N="69" REF="72">
trifles, or things of greater magnitude. Now, in whatever manner a nation lives, as &s;oon as it admits of property, there will nece&s;&s;arily be differences in fortune, and in the expences of individuals, and, of cour&s;e, on account of the&s;e differences, vanity and de&s;ire will take a certain lead in &s;uch a na|tion, whether it be le&s;s luxurious or more &s;o. Don't we ob&s;erve, in villages, that a very little expence which one inhabitant enters into more than another, in order to &s;upport his family, creates as much jealou&s;y and longing, as the eclat of the greate&s;t Luxury can excite in an opulent capital? Among the pea&s;antry, he who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a little flock of &s;heep, and a cow or two, is thought rich by his companions and town&s;|men, who look upon him with an envious eye, and who covet his happy &s;ituation, as much as others do the wealth and &s;plendor of tho&s;e above them.</P>
<P>The more, dignity, rank, and di&s;tinction take place in poli&s;hed nations, whatever &s;y&s;tem they follow with regard to Luxury, the greater is the degree of de&s;ire common to all. However true it may be, that where
<PB N="70" REF="73">
Luxury is unknown, temptations are fewer; the nation which prohibits indulgences, is not, on that account, free from covetou&s;ne&s;s or venality; for by an effect con&s;tantly proceeding from the nature of man, his de|&s;ires, when he is able only to exerci&s;e them on a &s;mall number of objects, actuate him more eagerly, than when he can exerci&s;e them on a greater number.</P>
<P>It does not appear, then, that our man|ners would improve by a voluntary contrac|tion of our wants; nor that we &s;hould ex|pect more virtue in a country who&s;e inha|bitants live hard, than in one where they lead a more comfortable life. Among both one and the other, pa&s;&s;ions ri&s;e from the &s;ame ba&s;is, and are actuated by the &s;ame, or equal incitements.</P>
<P>If we ca&s;t our eyes over the different na|tions that cover the earth, and look back to what hi&s;tory teaches us of pa&s;t ages, we &s;hall di&s;cover more outrageou&s;ne&s;s, more re|bellious actions, and, in general, manners le&s;s civilized, in times when the conveni|ences and indulgences of life were never coveted, than in tho&s;e where they were
<PB N="71" REF="74">
mo&s;t &s;tudied. Rea&s;on teaches us this. A de&s;ire for indulgences leads to di&s;&s;ipation, and induces men freely to communicate with each other. By this communication, the mind, accu&s;tomed to wandering, is le&s;s &s;u&s;|ceptible of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions; and the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;tudying continually to plea&s;e tho&s;e with whom we communicate, habitually &s;erves to &s;often the temper and poli&s;h the manners. All the&s;e circum&s;tances prove that men, in an opulent nation, enjoying their opulence, are naturally more mild, moderate, and le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to commit crimes of any magni|tude.</P>
<P>Let us examine into the lower cla&s;s of people in our own country. Tho&s;e who compo&s;e it, have no &s;uperfluities, nor have they any wi&s;h to obtain them. They are ab&s;olutely &s;o much out of their reach, that they never think of them. Now, what are the manners of the&s;e people? Let us com|pare them with the manners of tho&s;e who live at their ea&s;e, who have already, in a certain degree, ta&s;ted the &s;weets of Luxury, and who, with a view of encrea&s;ing their enjoyments, are &s;trongly tempted to encrea&s;e
<PB N="72" REF="75">
their fortune. May we not &s;ay, and with truth too, that the manners of the middle cla&s;s of people, exceed in goodne&s;s tho&s;e of the lower cla&s;s?</P>
<P>Our attributing to Luxury &s;uch a change of manners as is injurious to public pro&s;pe|rity, ri&s;es from want of di&s;cernment. We do not properly di&s;tingui&s;h between tho&s;e manners that are &s;ufficient to form the hap|pine&s;s of &s;ociety, and tho&s;e which rigid rec|titude pre&s;cribes. Our ideas of civil mora|lity are far from being preci&s;e, and we are too apt to confound it with that which is &s;peculative. There is, however, in matters of policy, a great deal of difference between the two.</P>
<P>Speculative morality tends to guide us by a pure and di&s;intere&s;ted love of rectitude; or to detach us from temporal things, by directing our views to tho&s;e which are eter|nal. Con&s;idering actions in them&s;elves, independent of all relation to &s;ociety, and connected only with the rules of perfection, it will not admit of any deviation. What I call civil morality, which has no object but to &s;weeten and &s;ecure the commerce of
<PB N="73" REF="76">
men among them&s;elves, and to maintain good public order, requires not a &s;trict ob|&s;ervation of all its precepts, but admits of every relaxation con&s;i&s;tent with the peace and pro&s;perity of Society. In judging, then, of the manners of a people, by the princi|ples of &s;peculative morality, we &s;hall find that a &s;pirit of Luxury in certain per&s;ons, too worldly-minded to be &s;en&s;ible of the value of perfect purity, weakens the prac|tice and authority of &s;ome of its doctrines. But, in judging of manners by the principles of civil morality, we &s;hall &s;ee nothing perni|cious in the&s;e relaxations, &s;ugge&s;ted by a &s;pirit of Luxury, whil&s;t they trouble not the harmony of &s;ociety, or impede the mo|tion of its &s;prings.</P>
<P>In fact, the political machine rolls on, without embarra&s;&s;ment, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e irregularities. Why then &s;hould we be in pain about them? They are attended with no bad con&s;equences; and the cau&s;e which produces them produces al&s;o a thou|&s;and important advantages. But this is &s;aying too little. Without a &s;pirit of Luxury among the people, as I have already ob&s;erv|ed,
<PB N="74" REF="77">
&s;ociety would not only langui&s;h, but even be annihilated. Luxury is the tie that unites men together. Of what u&s;e then are all our invectives again&s;t it? To what pur|po&s;e is it to rail at a thing which cannot be di&s;pen&s;ed with?&mdash;There are great inconve|niences attending the nece&s;&s;ity of eating; and yet the mo&s;t eloquent pen cannot induce us to refrain from this nece&s;&s;ity, but we eat on &s;till, and mu&s;t eat whil&s;t we live.</P>
<P>Vainly will you pretend to make a di&s;|tinction between Ea&s;e and Luxury. Where will you draw the line? How will you de|termine it for every cla&s;s of men, and for every individual in each cla&s;s? You have no principles capable of guiding you in this matter. Scarcely &s;hall you point out the e&s;&s;entials for one or two cla&s;&s;es of people, but you will find your&s;elf obliged to re|nounce the ta&s;k, and confe&s;s, that in things made u&s;e of by men, there are, in fact, but two kinds, <HI>Luxuries</HI> and <HI>Nece&s;&s;aries.</HI></P>
<P>Principles of virtue are, doubtle&s;s, nece&s;|&s;ary in a nation. Vices lead to its ruin. A State cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t, nor have any power, but by an attention to the duties of &s;ociety.
<PB N="75" REF="78">
All the vices, however, and all the virtues do not equally intere&s;t the pre&s;ervation of an empire. All &s;ocial obligations are not &s;o &s;trict, as to admit of no exten&s;ion. There are even violations, and very common ones, that no way attack the public pro&s;perity. A &s;y&s;tem of morality adopted by a numerous people, is not, in all its points, equally e&s;&s;ential to every individual. The well-being of a little nation requires a &s;tricter obedience to &s;ome certain precepts, which, without any bad con&s;equences, may be ne|glected by a great number of people in a nation more con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>The object of men uniting in a <HI>State,</HI> is very different from that of men uniting in a <HI>Cloi&s;ter.</HI> The attention of the fir&s;t is di|rected to the pre&s;ent life; their view is to render their time here ea&s;y, tranquil, and plea&s;ant: the other think only of a future life, and &s;tudy to &s;ecure their happine&s;s hereafter. The&s;e la&s;t cannot impo&s;e too &s;e|vere a di&s;cipline; whereas the fir&s;t pre&s;cribe and obey rules which tend to their temporal intere&s;t, leaving every individual to judge
<PB N="76" REF="79">
for him&s;elf, with re&s;pect to his eternal in|tere&s;t, according to his con&s;cience.</P>
<P>Severity, or re&s;traint of manners, and dome&s;tic regularity, are certainly very prai&s;e-worthy. Far be it from me to depre|ciate the merit of the&s;e virtues! But com|fortable and profitable as they are to tho&s;e who ob&s;erve them, with regard to the pro|&s;perity of a kingdom, they have not that im|portance that is attributed to them. When once the principles of probity and honour are &s;o generally practi&s;ed and re&s;pected in a nation, as to &s;ecure the common good, mo|rality has done all that policy requires. It mu&s;t look to other &s;ources for the happine&s;s and power of a people. Now, what are the&s;e &s;ources? Phy&s;ical means; the unfold|ing and exertion of the faculties both of mind and body; ingenuity in the arts of peace and war; capacity in bu&s;ine&s;s; an enlightened patrioti&s;m, that is to &s;ay, a &s;pirit of policy. From the&s;e it is that public pro&s;perity is principally derived. The&s;e are the objects to which a good citizen &s;hould direct his attention. Their import|ance
<PB N="77" REF="80">
will draw every other nece&s;&s;ary after them.</P>
<P>There have, indeed, exi&s;ted &s;ome &s;mall nations, who, though given up to a volun|tary or con&s;trained poverty, have neverthe|le&s;s performed &s;ome great exploits in war; but we mu&s;t not conclude, that, to be as illu&s;trious as them, we &s;hould live as they did. It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that their &s;ucce&s;s was not owing to their poverty, but to the enthu&s;ia&s;m of their virtues, produced by the education they received; to the attention they gave to their affairs; to their applica|tion to the u&s;e of arms; and that their po|verty was an ob&s;tacle which they had the greate&s;t difficulty to &s;urmount. We mu&s;t ob&s;erve al&s;o, that their rivals were not very powerful; that, for the mo&s;t part, they lived as hard as their enemies, and that where the conquerors and the conquered led the &s;ame kind of life, it is not in the manner of living that we mu&s;t look up for the cau&s;e of victory.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, triumphs in war do not prove the good morals of a people. The Bucca|neers who made the new world tremble,
<PB N="78" REF="81">
and who, in the ra&s;he&s;t enterprizes perform|ed prodigies of valour, were banditti. The Tartars, who conquered China, were rob|bers. What was Pizarro and his a&s;&s;ociates who conquered Peru? They &s;ubdued and ma&s;&s;acred an inoffen&s;ive people, habituated to the practice of &s;ocial virtues. To con|quer, it is &s;ufficient to know the art of war better, and employ it better than the enemy. Nothing is more foreign to the purity of manners. It is not in camps, in the mid&s;t of licentiou&s;ne&s;s and military barbarity, that we learn to regulate them.</P>
<P>We quote often the Romans and the Spartans; as if the Romans were powerful during the time they lived hard; and as if the Spartans, otherwi&s;e &s;urrounded than they were, would have been able, in keep|ing up their poverty, to have rendered them&s;elves formidable to their neighbours, or even to have pre&s;erved them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Every time that the&s;e old examples are brought to prove that a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;pend money, and a de&s;ire for various enjoyments are prejudicial to a State, as tending to the extinction of virtue; how is it that &s;o
<PB N="79" REF="82">
&s;triking an ob&s;ervation is not, in &s;ome de|gree, a check to us? The people of Greece did not cultivate the arts, give into magni|ficence, or &s;tudy plea&s;ure &s;o much as the Athenians, and yet the hi&s;tory of the Athe|nians furni&s;hes more renowned &s;ayings, more glorious actions, and more illu&s;trious achievements, both public and private, than that of the Spartans, of who&s;e &s;everity in living, &s;o much boa&s;t is made.</P>
<P>Among the illu&s;trious men of Plutarch and Cornelius Nepos, there are &s;ix Lacede|monians and fifteen Athenians. To the&s;e may be added Socrates and Plato, of whom Plutarch and Cornelius Nepos are &s;ilent, they having been neither commanders of armies, nor public mini&s;ters; though they are not le&s;s illu&s;trious on that account. Among the &s;ix Lacedemonians are Pau&s;a|nias and Ly&s;ander, who, though able men, and renowned for valiant exploits, were far from being good men.</P>
<P>The manners of the Spartans, though brilliant in certain re&s;pects, were, in general, very bad. Enthu&s;ia&s;m carried them beyond
<PB N="80" REF="83">
all example; but &s;ober rea&s;on condemned them.</P>
<P>Good morals, con&s;idered only as they re&s;pect &s;ociety, and without any view of a life to come, like civil morals, are of greater value, in proportion as they render men happy on this &s;ide the grave. Morals, or manners, in this light, are better or wor&s;e, as they encrea&s;e or dimini&s;h the happine&s;s of the people. This is the touch&s;tone by which we &s;hould judge of them.</P>
<P>The Spartans were brave and valiant, in|flamed with the love of their country and of liberty; but they were perfidious, ungrate|ful, envious, arrogant, eager to rule, unju&s;t, inhuman, and often mean. Their &s;ociety yielded them neither comforts, plea&s;ure, nor &s;ecurity. Such is the idea we are taught to conceive of this people from ancient hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>But let us not revert to former ages. All there is too much enveloped in ob&s;curity. The facts of tho&s;e times, as far as they con|cern us, &s;tand &s;ingle, and are few in num|ber. They cannot be &s;ufficiently known in their detail, nor as they relate to the cau&s;es of the mi&s;ery or pro&s;perity of tho&s;e nations
<PB N="81" REF="84">
to which they belong, &s;o as to give any coun|tenance to political &s;y&s;tems at this day. We ought not to form our ideas on &s;uch uncer|tain grounds, le&s;t fatal errors &s;hould be the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Modern times afford us facts more cer|tain and conclu&s;ive. We inhabit a king|dom, and we have neighbouring States, where Luxury has a long time reigned. We &s;ee not Sparta in Italy, in France, or in England; and yet, are the&s;e countries le&s;s illu&s;trious, in war or in peace? To look back but two hundred years, have they not produced renowned generals, celebrated writers, able mini&s;ters, enlightened magi&s;|trates, and very di&s;tingui&s;hed inventors and arti&s;ts? What bravery, what abilities, what greatne&s;s of &s;oul, what fortitude, what in|genuity, what di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, may we not trace, in this &s;pace of time, among the inhabitants of the&s;e countries; &s;uch as would do honour to ancient Greece, or an|cient Rome! How many noble and bril|liant actions are lo&s;t in the crowd, of which we are &s;till ignorant!</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="85">Since the&s;e powerful nations then exi&s;t, where a &s;pirit of Luxury is limited only by the means, or by the fortune of a people, and among whom we find the&s;e moral qua|lities e&s;&s;ential to the &s;upport of the&s;e States; &s;ince the&s;e nations flouri&s;h (for certainly England, France, and Italy, may be &s;aid to flouri&s;h, in contradi&s;tinction to Spain, where the inhabitants live upon onions; to Swe|den, where there are &s;umptuary laws; and to Poland, where the people go almo&s;t naked); it mu&s;t be allowed, that a de&s;ire for enjoy|ments, in changing the manners, do not render them wor&s;e; or that policy, in not curbing this de&s;ire, rectifies its bad effects, &s;o as not to leave it prejudicial to the State.</P>
<P>Exten&s;ion of enjoyments has nothing in it&s;elf incompatible with innocence and vir|tue. It is more con&s;onant to true wi&s;dom to profit by the ble&s;&s;ings of nature, than to refu&s;e them. U&s;eful virtues are more practicable in opulence than in poverty; and hardne&s;s of living nece&s;&s;arily leads to poverty, as a &s;pirit of Luxury, in exerci&s;ing all the faculties, leads commonly to opu|lence.

<P>Manners take their ri&s;e from the con&s;ti|tution of government, and the tenets &s;pread throughout a nation, re&s;pecting all the ob|jects that intere&s;t it.

<P>The tenets of a nation re&s;pecting the objects that intere&s;t it, and the con&s;titution of its government, depend upon the man|ner in which it has been in&s;tructed. Man|ners, then, primarily depend upon educa|tion.

Inculcate the principles of honour, ju&s;tice, and virtue, by a good education; &s;upport them, not on fal&s;e or confu&s;ed no|tions, but upon &s;ound and clear ideas; let your pupils be well in&s;pired with this great maxim, <HI>N'u&s;urpe point et re&s;pecte-toi,</HI> a maxim more preci&s;e than the ancient pro|verb &s;o well known, <HI>Do not to others what you would not have them do unto you;</HI> take care, by your form of government, to make it the common intere&s;t to keep up to this principle, and you will acknowledge that the enjoyments of Luxury, innocent in them&s;elves, will never corrupt a purity of manners.</P>
<P>The influence of education is all-power|ful. Religions are propagated and &s;upport|ed by in&s;truction. Give a free flight to li|terature; encourage the liberty of the pre&s;s; let no con&s;traint &s;tifle the voice of tho&s;e men, who, devoted to &s;tudy, reflect for man|kind, and enrich the world with the fruits of their genius; and all the reformations nece&s;&s;ary for the public good, will break out, one after another, without confu&s;ion, and without trouble. Should error get hold of
<PB N="85" REF="88">
&s;ome minds, and extend it&s;elf, by means of &s;uch liberty of the pre&s;s, a thou&s;and oppo&s;ers would, by that &s;ame liberty, ri&s;e again&s;t it. The &s;un of critici&s;m and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion will di&s;&s;ipate every cloud, and nothing will gain an e&s;tabli&s;hment, which does not bear the &s;eal of rea&s;on and of truth.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, whatever may be &s;aid of the influence of Luxury on the manners of the people; as men a&s;&s;ociate only to procure them&s;elves enjoyments, and, as the attrac|tion to &s;uch enjoyments is the &s;ole &s;ource of the power and happine&s;s of &s;ociety, it mu&s;t be con&s;ulted, though the morals of the Public were, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to be affected thereby. If temporal utility be merely con|&s;idered, &s;uch morals as are con&s;i&s;tent with a &s;pirit of Luxury are &s;ufficiently good; &s;ince &s;ociety cannot exi&s;t without Luxury, any more than without morality; and as &s;ocieties, the &s;upport of which is the &s;ole end of civil morality, have not only exi&s;ted for many ages, but have been more happy, more numerous, and more powerful, in proportion to the degree of Luxury among them, where the nature of their govern|ment
<PB N="86" REF="89">
has not fru&s;trated the advantages de|rived from this &s;ource.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, in countries where Luxury is predominant, we &s;ee a va&s;t num|ber of towns, an infinite population, good order exi&s;ting, and nature embelli&s;hed to the utmo&s;t; on the contrary, in tho&s;e new climates, where the indu&s;try of man, &s;till enveloped, leaves him but little exertion for &s;uperfluities, the be&s;t &s;oils are but bound|le&s;s de&s;arts. Nature pre&s;ents but a &s;hape|le&s;s &s;cene; her riches are thinly &s;cattered, and lo&s;t in the confu&s;ion, while the human &s;pecies, &s;mall in number, wandering in the fore&s;ts, &s;ubmitting to the inclemency of &s;ea&s;ons, and often pining under the horrors of want, is, in its happie&s;t moments, obliged to contend with every animal for &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>Though a &s;pirit of Luxury has bene commonly accu&s;ed as the &s;courge of States, an examination of its effects has given me a very different idea. An extinction, or even a great diminution of Luxury, would, in my opinion, bring on mi&s;ery, barbari&s;m, and an immen&s;e depopulation; and in a com|mercial
<PB N="87" REF="90">
State, like ours, involved in a va&s;t na|tional debt, the intere&s;t of which can be paid only by its Luxuries, total ruin. On the other hand, free Luxury, under a well-ordered go|vernment, appears to me to be attended with plenty, wealth, and public happine&s;s. The&s;e ideas, too much unknown till now, &s;trike me with their importance. I have ventur|ed to declare them, and if the&s;e be&s;t inten|tions may, in any degree, recommend a work, mine has a claim to the attention of every thinking man.</P>
<P>Careful and diligent as I may have been; like other men, I am not &s;ecure again&s;t illu|&s;ion. I hope, however, I am entitled to indulgence. When a man thinks him&s;elf able to de&s;troy a fatal opinion, he is com|mendable in the attempt; nay, he is not allowed to be &s;ilent.</P>

<P>The FIRST FOUR RULES of ARITHMETIC.</P>
<P>Price 1s. So fully explained, as to be learned without the help of a ma&s;ter, which is not the ca&s;e with any book of Arithmetic extant.</P>

<P>FAMILY TABLES, Price 3s. Being a collection of u&s;eful tables, framed for the various purpo&s;es of life, they will find more than the fir&s;t four rules of arithmetic un|nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Shortly will be publi&s;hed, by R. Baldwin, A New Edition, With improvements and additions, but for the u&s;e of &s;chools printed in one volume in 12mo, The DISTINCTION between WORDS e&s;teemed SYNONYMOUS in the Engli&s;h Language.</P>
