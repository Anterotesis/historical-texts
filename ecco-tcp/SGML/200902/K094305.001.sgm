This church &s;uffered many times by lightning, fire, and other accidents; which was as often repair|ed: and &s;uch parts of it
<PB N="41" REF="39">as fell to decay thro' age, were rebuilt; till at la&s;t it was de&s;troy's in the great fire of London in 1666, and one thou&s;and and fif|ty-&s;ix years from its fir&s;t building.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the foundation, build|ing, and &s;ituation of the pre&s;ent Church.</HEAD>
<P>THE old church of St. Paul's having been de|&s;troy'd,
<PB N="42" REF="40">as mention'd in the fir&s;t chapter, and the ruins and rubbi&s;h of it cleared in about eight or nine years after; the fir&s;t foundation &s;tone of this pre&s;ent church was laid by Mr. Strong, a ma&s;on, and the &s;econd by Mr. Long. land, on the twenty fir&s;t of June, 1675. at the north|ea&s;t corner, facing Cheap|&s;ide: From which time it was not completely fi|ni&s;h'd
<PB N="43" REF="41">till the year 1724. being about forty-nine years in building. It was begun and fini&s;h'd by the &s;ame architect, Sir Chri&s;|topher Wren, and by the &s;ame ma&s;on, Mr. Strong abovementioned: The charge of which is &s;aid to amount to one million of money, or upwards. The whole building is encom|pa&s;&s;ed with &s;trong iron pa|li&s;ades, all curiou&s;ly turn'd,
<PB N="44" REF="42">about five and twenty hundred in number; which co&s;t fifteen thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>This magni&s;icent &s;truc|ture, which &s;tands upon the highe&s;t ground in the city, near to the we&s;t gate, called Ludgate, is the fir&s;t Cathedral in England built according to the rules of architecture. Its walls are of fine Portland &s;tone, ru&s;tic work. Two ranges
<PB N="45" REF="43">of pila&s;ters adorn the out|&s;ide, one above the other; the lower con&s;i&s;ts of about an hundred and twenty, with their entablatues of the Corinthian order, and the upper of as many of the Compo&s;ite, or Roman order: be&s;ides twenty co|lumns at the we&s;t and four at the ea&s;t end, and tho&s;e of the portico's, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;paces between the arches of the windows and
<PB N="46" REF="44">the architrave of the lower order, are filled with great variety of curious enrich|ments, &s;uch as cherubims, fe&s;toons of flowers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and at the ea&s;t end is the cipher of W. R. within a garter, on which are the words HONI SOIT QUI MALY PENSE; in Engli&s;h, <HI>Evil be to him that evil thinks:</HI> and this within a fine com|partment of palm-branch|es, and placed under an

<P>All the parts of this grand church, both within and without, are built with &s;uch proportion and art, that the eye is charmed with the exact order of its pillars, which &s;upport the portico's dome, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the beauty of their capitals; the rich corni&s;h where|with they are embelli&s;hed; the number of &s;pacious

<HEAD>Four INDIAN KINGS.</HEAD>

<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="55" REF="53">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the &s;trange conceptions four Indian Kings had of this great building; and how they imagin'd it at fir&s;t to be one grent rock that grew in that place.</HEAD>
<P><HI>SA Ga Yean Qua Ra&s;h Tow,</HI> one of the four Indian Kings who were in this country about thirty-two years ago, among&s;t
<PB N="56" REF="54">other curious remarks which he made whil&s;t he was in England, left be|hind him the following concerning St. Paul's church.</P>
<P>There &s;tands, &s;ays he, on the mo&s;t ri&s;ing part of the town a huge hou&s;e, big enough to contain the whole nation of which I am king.</P>
<P>Our good brother, <HI>E Tow O Koam,</HI> king of the
<PB N="57" REF="55">Rivers, is of opinion it was made by the hands of the great God to whom it is con&s;ecrated (<HI>meaning</HI> St. Paul.)</P>
<P>The kings of Grana|jah and of the Six Na|tions, believe that it was created with the earth, and produced on the &s;ame day with the &s;un and moon.</P>
<P>But, &s;ays he, for my own part, and from the be&s;t information that I can
<PB N="58" REF="56">get of this matter, I am apt to think that this va&s;t temple was fa&s;hioned into the &s;hape it now bears by &s;everal tools and in&s;tru|ments, of which they have a wonderful variety in this country.</P>
<P>I imagine it was at fir&s;t only an huge mi&s;-&s;hapen rock that grew upon the top of the hill; which the natives of the country, after having cut it into a
<PB N="59" REF="57">kind of regular figure, bor|ed and hollowed with in|credible pains and indu&s;|try; till they had wrought in it all tho&s;e beautiful vaults and caverns into which it is divided at this day.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as this rock was thus curiou&s;ly &s;cooped to their liking, then a prodi|gious number of hands mu&s;t have been employ'd in chipping the out&s;ide of
<PB N="60" REF="58">it, and &s;moothing the &s;ur|face; which is in &s;everal places hewn out into pil|lars, that &s;tand like the trunks of &s;o many trees, bound about the top with garlands of leaves.</P>
<P>It is probable, &s;ays this Indian monarch, that when this great work was begun, which mu&s;t have been many hundred years ago, there was &s;ome reli|gion among this people;
<PB N="61" REF="59">for they give it the name of a Temple, and have a tradition that it was de|&s;igned for men to pay their devotions in.</P>
<P>And indeed, there are &s;everal rea&s;ons which make us think that the natives of this country had formerly among them &s;ome &s;ort of wor&s;hip; for they &s;et apart every &s;e|venth day as &s;acred. But upon my going into one
<PB N="62" REF="60">of tho&s;e holy hou&s;es on that day, I could not ob|&s;erve any circum&s;tance of devotion in their behavi|our: There was indeed a man in black who, mount|ed above the re&s;t, &s;eemed to utter &s;omething with great vehemence; but as for tho&s;e underneath him, in&s;tead of paying their wor&s;hip to the Deity of the place, they were mo&s;t of them bowing and cur|tefying
<PB N="63" REF="61">to one another; and a great number of them fall a&s;leep.</P>
<P>Whether the&s;e were the real thoughts of tho&s;e roy|al &s;trangers, I will not take upon me to an&s;wer. But what wonder is it that &s;uch &s;avage kings, who&s;e dwellings are in huts and thickets, &s;hould form &s;uch wild notions of this prodigious &s;tructure,
<PB N="64" REF="62">when we our&s;elves, who &s;ee it daily, are filled with a&s;toni&s;hment at the magni|tude and grandeur of this glorious building; and how &s;uch a work could be performed by mortal hands!</P>
<P>WE &s;hall now proceed to examine the particular curio&s;ities of this church.</P>

<P><PB N="67" REF="65">She has her crown upon her head; the &s;cepter in her right hand, and the globe in her left: her dre&s;s is very rich, and the work|man&s;hip of it exceeding curious.</P>
<P>On her right hand is Britannia; who appears with a very lovely and chearful countenance: &s;he has a crown of laurel upon her head; a &s;pear in her right hand, and her left
<PB N="68" REF="66">reaching to the royal arms in the front of the pede|&s;tal.</P>
<P>On her left hand is France: &s;he &s;eems much dejected, very thoughtful, and in a langui&s;hing &s;tate. Her right hand re&s;ts upon a truncheon, and her left holds a crown, which lies down in her lap. She is clothed with a very rich robe, adorned with flower de lis; and upon her head
<PB N="69" REF="67">&s;he has a warrior's cap, or helmet.</P>
<P>Behind the queen is Ireland, with her harp in her lap: her looks are amiable and plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>The fourth is America, in the habit of her coun|try; her body being al|mo&s;t naked: &s;he has upon her head a crown of cu|rious feather, a bow in her left hand, and a qui|ver of arrows on her back:
<PB N="70" REF="68">&s;he has the head of an Eu|ropean under her foot, with an arrow &s;ticking in it; &s;uppo&s;ed to have been ju&s;t &s;hot from her bow. There is likewi&s;e an allegator creeping from beneath her feet; being an animal very common in &s;ome parts of America, and which lives both on the land and in the water.</P>
<P>The queen's, and all the other figures, are of
<PB N="71" REF="69">fine Italian, &s;tatuary mar|ble; the pede&s;tal of vein|ed marble.</P>
<P>The former were all cut out of one &s;olid, rough block of marble, which was taken by one of our Engli&s;h &s;hips, during the late war, in its pa&s;&s;age from Leghorn to France; and was de&s;igned for the effigy of Lewis the fourteenth, on hor&s;eback.</P>
<P>The carver was the late
<PB N="72" REF="70">ingenious Mr. Francis Bird.</P>
<P>The foot of the pede&s;tal is encircled with three marble &s;teps; and the whole encompa&s;&s;ed with beautiful, &s;trong, iron pa|li&s;ades.</P>
<P>This royal &s;tatue, on account of its grand &s;up|porters, fines pede&s;tal, and curious workman&s;hip, is e&s;teemed &s;uperior to all others in Europe.</P>

<PB N="76" REF="74">his right hand is St. Peter with a cock; and on his left, St. James.</P>
<P>In the front of the two lo&s;ty and beautiful towers, are the four Evangeli&s;ts: In the north, St. Matthew with an angel, and St. Mark with a lion. In the &s;outh, St. Luke with an ox, and St. John with an eagle.</P>
<P>The&s;e two towers are each adorn'd with circular ranger of columns, of the
<PB N="77" REF="75">Corinthian order, with domes on the upper part, and on the top of each a gilded pine apple.</P>
<P>In the &s;outh tower is the famours large clock, the bell of which weighs four ton and four hundred and four pounds; and its &s;ound may be heard at five or &s;ix miles di&s;tance. The work of this clock is large and curious: it is kept in ex|cellent good order, and ge|nerally
<PB N="78" REF="76">nerally carries the hour of the day very exectly; a skilful per&s;on being ap|pointed to look after it for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve likewife the fine carvings, and other rich embelli&s;hments, over the whole front of this noble &s;tructure.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, you a&s;cend to the great door by twen|ty four &s;pacious &s;tone &s;teps; the fir&s;t ten of which
<PB N="79" REF="77">extend in width above for|ty yards each, and the other fourteen full thirty &s;ix yards.</P>
<P>The door ca&s;e is white marble: and over the en|trance is cut in relievo the hi&s;tory of St. Paul preach|ing to the Bereans. It con&s;i&s;ts of a group of nine &s;igures be&s;ides that of St. Paul, with books, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e Bereans were a &s;ort of people ingenous and

<P>Under the arch on the right hand, in a pannel, is St. Paul's impri&s;onment; and on the left hand in the

<P>My young readers will find the hi&s;tory of St. Paul's impri&s;onment in the &s;ix|teenth chapter of the <HI>Acts,</HI> and his preaching to the Athenians in the &s;even|teenth chapter, both beau|tifully related.</P>

<P>The other two hundred and &s;eventy four &s;teps are pretty &s;teep, and in many places, from the large &s;tone gallery to the upper galle|ry, very dark; &s;o that one per&s;on can &s;carce di&s;cern another.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="90">In this place we have a glimmering &s;ight of &s;uch prodigious works in iron, &s;tone, and timber, which hold together the dome, cupola, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that it is im|po&s;&s;ible to convey an idea of it to my readers: And though the&s;e ama&s;ing works are very curious to &s;ee, yet my young ma&s;ters and mi&s;&s;es mu&s;t not by any means venture them|&s;elves here without a guide.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="91">The iron gallery on the top of the cupola, is the highe&s;t any one is &s;uffer'd to go; above that are the lantern, ball and cro&s;s; to the top of which, from the gallery ju&s;t mention'd, is &s;ixty four feet; and the pa&s;&s;age thither by ladders, very difficult and danger|ous to a&s;cend.</P>
<P>From this gallery, in fine clear weather, we may agreeably ob&s;erve the va&s;t

<P>This gallery is a very great curio&s;ity: 'Tis a

<P>ST. PAUL, before his conver&s;ion, having been principally concern'd in the death of St. Ste|phen, and his bloody mind not &s;atisfied with this cru|elty, threatens nothing le&s;s than pri&s;ons and death to the Chri&s;tians wherever
<PB N="102" REF="100">he found them.

<PB N="103" REF="101">the bloody pro&s;pect, God, in mercy to him, and tho&s;e he went to per&s;ecute, takes him off from his wicked de&s;ign: a bright &s;hining cloud incompa&s;&s;ed him, which &s;truck him with great terror, as at the pre|&s;ence of God, and threw him pro&s;trate on the ground, where as he lay he heard a voice out of it, &s;aying unto him. <HI>Saul, Saul, why per&s;ecute&s;t thou
<PB N="104" REF="102">me?</HI> This increas'd his amazement: and being de&s;irous to know the meaning of this vi&s;ion, he asks, <HI>Who art thou, Lord!</HI> The voice reply'd, <HI>I am</HI> JESUS, <HI>whom thou pre&s;e|cute&s;t:</HI> It is in vain for thee to re&s;i&s;t the decrees of providence, therefore be no longer di&s;obedient, but hearken to the com|mands that &s;hall be given thee.
