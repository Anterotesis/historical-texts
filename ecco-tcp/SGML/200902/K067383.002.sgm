<P><MILESTONE N="1216" UNIT="year"> MOST &s;ciences, in proportion as they encrea&s;e and improve, invent methods by which they facilitate their rea&s;onings; and employing ge|neral theorems, are enabled to comprehend in a few propo&s;itions an in|finite number of inferences and conclu&s;ions. Hi&s;tory al&s;o, being a collection of facts, which are multiplying without end, is obliged to adopt &s;uch arts of abridge|ment, to retain the more material events, and to drop all the minute circum|&s;tances,
<PB N="2" REF="8">
which are only intere&s;ting during the time, or to the per&s;ons engaged in the tran&s;actions. This truth is no where more evident than with regard to the reign, upon which we are going to enter. What mortal could have the patience to write or read a long detail of &s;uch frivolous events as tho&s;e with which it is filled, or attend to a tedious narrative which would follow, thro' a &s;eries of fifty &s;ix years, the caprices and weakne&s;&s;es of &s;o mean a prince as Henry? The chief rea&s;on, why prote&s;tant writers have been &s;o anxious to &s;pread out the inci|dents of this reign, is in order to expo&s;e the rapacity, ambition, and artifices of the court of Rome, and to prove, that the great dignitaries of the catholic church, while they pretended to have nothing in view but the &s;alvation of &s;ouls, had bent all their attention to the acqui&s;ition of riches, and were re&s;trained by no &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice or honour, in the pur&s;uit of that great object<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Paris. p. 623.</NOTE>. But this conclu&s;ion would readily be allowed them, tho' it were not illu&s;trated by &s;uch a detail of unintere&s;ting incidents; and follows indeed, by an evident nece&s;&s;ity, from the ve|ry &s;ituation, in which that church was placed with regard to the re&s;t of Europe. For be&s;ides that all eccle&s;ia&s;tical power, as it can always cover its operations un|der a cloak of &s;anctity, and attacks men on the &s;ide where they dare not employ their rea&s;on, lies le&s;s under controul than civil government; be&s;ides this general cau&s;e, I &s;ay, the Pope and his courtiers were foreigners to mo&s;t of the churches which they governed; they could not po&s;&s;ibly have any other object but to pil|lage the provinces for pre&s;ent gain; and as they lived at a di&s;tance, they would be little awed by &s;hame or remor&s;e, in practi&s;ing every lucrative expedient, which was &s;ugge&s;ted to them. England being one of the mo&s;t remote provinces, at|tached to the Romi&s;h hierarchy, as well as one of the riche&s;t, and the mo&s;t prone to &s;uper&s;tition, felt &s;everely during this reign, while its patience was not yet fully exhau&s;ted, the influence of the&s;e cau&s;es; and we &s;hall often have occa&s;ion to touch cur&s;orily upon &s;uch incidents. But we &s;hall not attempt to comprehend every tran&s;action tran&s;mitted to us; and till the end of the reign, when the e|vents become more memorable, we &s;hall not always ob&s;erve an exact chronolo|gical order in our narration.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Settlement of the govern|ment.</NOTE> THE earl of Pembroke, who, at the time of John's death, was mari&s;chal of England, was by his office at the head of the armies, and con&s;equently, during a &s;tate of civil wars and convul&s;ions, at the head of the &s;tate; and it happened fortunately for the young monarch, and for the nation, that the power could not have been intru&s;ted into more able and more faithful hands. This nobleman, who had maintained his loyalty un&s;haken to John during the lowe&s;t fortune of that monarch, determined to &s;upport the authority of the infant prince; and he
<PB N="3" REF="9">
was not di&s;mayed with the number and violence of his enemies. <NOTE PLACE="marg">28th Oct.</NOTE> Sen&s;ible, that Henry, according to the prejudices of the times, would not be deemed &s;ove|reign, till crown'd and anointed by a churchman; he immediately carried the young prince to Gloce&s;ter where the ceremony of coronation was performed, in the pre&s;ence of Gualo, the legate, and a very few noblemen, by the bi&s;hops of Winche&s;ter and Bath<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Paris. p. 200. Hi&s;t. Croy&s;. Cont. p. 474. W. Heming. p. 562. Trevet. p. 168.</NOTE>. As the concurrence of the papal authority was requi&s;ite to &s;upport the tottering throne, Henry was obliged to &s;wear fealty to the Pope, and renew that homage, to which his father had already &s;ubjected the kingdom<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">M. Paris. p. 200.</NOTE>: <NOTE PLACE="marg">11th Nov.</NOTE> And in order to enlarge the authority of Pembroke, and give him a more regu|lar and legal title to it, a general council of the barons was &s;oon after &s;ummoned at Bri&s;tol, where that nobleman was cho&s;en protector of the kingdom.</P>
<P>PEMBROKE, that he might reconcile all men to the government of his pupil, made him grant anew a charter of liberties, which, tho' mo&s;tly copied from the former conce&s;&s;ions, extorted from John, contains &s;ome alterations, which may be deemed remarkable<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer. Vol. 1. p. 215.</NOTE>. The full privilege of elections in the clergy, granted by John the former King, was not confirm'd nor the liberty of going out of the kingdom, without the royal con&s;ent: Whence we may conjecture, that Pem|broke and the barons, jealous of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical power, were de&s;irous of renew|ing the King's claim to i&s;&s;ue a cong&egrave; d'elire to the monks and chapters, and thought it requi&s;ite to put &s;ome check on the frequent appeals to Rome. But what may chiefly &s;urprize us; the obligation, to which John had &s;ubjected him|&s;elf, of obtaining the con&s;ent of the great council before he levied any aids or &s;cutages from the nation, was omitted; and this article was even declared hard and &s;evere, and was expre&s;sly left to future
deliberation. But we mu&s;t con&s;ider, that, tho' this limitation may perhaps appear to us the mo&s;t momentous in the whole charter of John, it was not regarded in that light by the antient barons, who were more jealous of particular acts of violence in the crown than of &s;uch general impo&s;itions, which, unle&s;s they were evidently rea&s;onable and nece&s;&s;ary, could &s;carce, without a general con&s;ent, be levied upon men, who had arms in their hands, and who could repel any act of oppre&s;&s;ion, by which they were all immediately affected. We accordingly find, that Henry, in the cour&s;e of his reign, while he gave frequent occa&s;ions for complaint, with regard to the viola|tions of the great charter, never once attempted, by his mere will, to levy any aids or &s;cutages; though he was often reduc'd to great nece&s;&s;ities, and was re|fu&s;ed &s;upplies by his people. So much ea&s;ier was it for him to tran&s;gre&s;s the
<PB N="4" REF="10">
law, when individuals alone were affected, than even to exert his acknowledged prerogatives, where the intere&s;t of the whole body was concerned.</P>
<P>This charter was again confirmed by the King in the en&s;uing year, with the addition of &s;ome articles to prevent the oppre&s;&s;ions of &s;heriffs: And al&s;o with an additional charter of fore&s;ts, a circum&s;tance of great moment in tho&s;e ages, when hunting was &s;o much the occupation of the nobility, and when the King comprehended &s;o con&s;iderable a part of the kingdom within his fore&s;ts, which he govern'd by peculiar and arbitrary laws. All the fore&s;ts, which had been enclo&s;|ed &s;ince the reign of Henry the &s;econd, were de&s;afore&s;ted; and new perambula|tions were appointed for that purpo&s;e: Offences in the fore&s;ts were declared to be no longer capital; but puni&s;hable by fines, impri&s;onments, and more gentle penalties: And all the proprietors of land recovered the power of cutting and u&s;ing their own wood at their plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>THUS, the&s;e famous charters were brought very nearly to the &s;hape, in which they have ever &s;ince &s;tood; and they were, during many generations, the darling of the whole Engli&s;h nation, and e&s;teemed the mo&s;t &s;acred rampart to national liberty and independance. As they &s;ecured the rights of all orders of men, they were regarded with a jealous eye by all, and became the ba&s;is, in a manner, of the Engli&s;h monarchy, and a kind of original contract, which both limited the authority of the King, and en&s;ured the conditional allegiance of his &s;ubjects. Tho' often violated, they were &s;till claimed and recalled by the nobility and people; and as no precedents were &s;uppo&s;ed valid, that infringed them, they rather ac|quired, than lo&s;t authority, from the frequent attempts, made again&s;t them in &s;everal ages, by regal and arbitrary power.</P>
<P>WHILE Pembroke, by renewing and confirming the great charter, gave &s;o much &s;atisfaction and &s;ecurity to the nation in general, he al&s;o applied him&s;elf &s;ucce&s;sfully to individuals; and wrote letters, in the King's name, to all the malecontent barons; in which he repre&s;ented to them, that whatever jealou&s;y and animo&s;ity they might have entertained again&s;t the late King, a young prince, the lineal heir of their antient monarchs, had now fucceeded to the throne, without &s;ucceeding either to the re&s;entments or principles of his predece&s;&s;or: That the de&s;perate expedient, which they had employed, of calling in a foreign potentate, had, happily for them as well as for the nation, failed of entire &s;ucce&s;s, and it was &s;till in their power, by a quick return to their duty, to re&s;tore the indepen|dance of the kingdom, and to &s;ecure that liberty, for which they &s;o zealou&s;ly contended: That as all pa&s;t offences of the barons were now buried in oblivion, they ought, on their part, to forget their complaints again&s;t their late &s;overeign, who, if he had been any wi&s;e blameable in his conduct, had left to his &s;on the
<PB N="5" REF="11">
&s;alutary warning, to avoid the paths, which had led to &s;uch fatal extremities: And that having now obtained a charter for their liberties, it was their intere&s;t to &s;how, by their conduct, that that acqui&s;ition was not incompatible with their allegiance, and that the rights of King and people, &s;o far from being ho&s;tile and oppo&s;ite, might mutually &s;upport and &s;u&s;tain each other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer. vol. 1. p. 215. Brady's App. N^o. 143.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE con&s;iderations, enforced by the character of con&s;tancy and fidelity, which Pembroke had ever maintained, had a mighty influence on the barons; and mo&s;t of them began &s;ecretly to negotiate with him, and many of them openly return|ed to their duty. The diffidence, which Lewis di&s;covered of their fidelity, for|warded this general propen&s;ion towards the King; and when the French prince refu&s;ed the government of the ca&s;tle of Hertford to Robert Fitz-Walter, who had been &s;o active again&s;t the late King, and who claimed that fortre&s;s as his right and property, they all plainly &s;aw, that the Engli&s;h were excluded from every tru&s;t, and that foreigners had engro&s;&s;ed all the confidence and affection of their new &s;overeign<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">M. Paris. p. 200, 202.</NOTE>. The excommunication too, denounced by the legate, again&s;t all Lewis's adherents, failed not, in the turn which mens di&s;po&s;itions had taken, to operate a mighty effect upon them; and they were ea&s;ily per&s;uad|ed to con&s;ider a cau&s;e as impious and profane, for which they had already en|tertained an un&s;urmountable aver&s;ion<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">M. Paris. p. 200. M. We&s;t. p. 277.</NOTE>. Tho' Lewis made a journey to France, and brought over fre&s;h &s;uccours from that kingdom<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. 1. p. 79. M. We&s;t. p. 277.</NOTE>, he found, on his return, that his party was &s;till more weakened by the de&s;ertion of his Engli&s;h confede|rates, and that the death of John, had, contrary to his expectation, given an in|curable blow to his cau&s;e. The earls of Sali&s;bury, Arundel, and Warrenne, to|gether with William Mare&s;hal, elde&s;t &s;on of the protector, had embraced Hen|ry's party; and every Engli&s;h nobleman was plainly watching an opportunity of returning to his allegiance. Pembroke was &s;o much &s;trengthened by the&s;e acce&s;&s;ions, that he ventured to inve&s;t Mount-&s;orel; tho', upon the approach of the count de Perche with the French army, he de&s;i&s;ted from his enterprize, and rai&s;ed the &s;iege<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">M. Paris. p. 203.</NOTE>. The count de Perche, elated with this &s;ucce&s;s, marched to Lincoln' and being admitted into the town, he began to attack the ca&s;tle, which he &s;oon reduced to extremity. The protector &s;ummoned all his forces from every quarter in order to relieve a place of &s;uch importance; and he appeared &s;o much &s;uperi|or to the French, that they &s;hut them&s;elves up within the city, and re&s;olved to take &s;helter behind the walls<NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. 1. p. 81.</NOTE>. But the garri&s;on of the ca&s;tle, having re|ceived
<PB N="6" REF="12">
a &s;trong reinforcement, made a vigorous &s;ally upon the be&s;iegers; while the Engli&s;h army, by concert, a&s;&s;aulted them in the &s;ame in&s;tant from without, mounted the walls by &s;calade, and bearing down all re&s;i&s;tance, entered the city &s;word in hand. Lincoln was delivered over to be pillaged; the French army was totally routed; the count de Perche, with only two per&s;ons more, was kil|led, but many of the chief commanders and about 400 knights were made pri|&s;oners by the Engli&s;h<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">M. Paris. p. 204, 205. Chron de Mullr. p. 195.</NOTE>. So little b ood was &s;hed in this important action, which decided the fate of one of the mo&s;t powerful kingdoms of Europe; and &s;uch wretched &s;oldiers were tho&s;e antient barons, who yet were unacquainted with every thing but arms.</P>
<P>Prince Lewis was informed of this fatal event, while employed in the &s;iege of Dover, which was &s;till valiantly defended again&s;t him by Hubert de Burgh. He immediately retreated towards London, which was the center and life of his par|ty; and he there received intelligence of a new di&s;a&s;ter, which put an end to all his hopes. A French fleet bringing over a &s;trong reinforcement, had appeared on the coa&s;t of Kent, when they were attacked by the Engli&s;h under the com|mand of Philip d'Albiney, and were routed and repul&s;ed with con&s;iderable lo&s;s. D' Albiney practi&s;ed a &s;tratagem again&s;t them, which is &s;aid to have contribut|ed to the victory: Having gained the wind of the French, he came down upon them with violence; and throwing in their faces a great quantity of quick-lime, which he purpo&s;ely carried on board, he &s;o blinded them, that they were di&s;a|bled from defending them&s;elves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Paris. p. 206. Ann. Warerl. p. 183. W. Heming. p. 563. Trevet. p. 169. M. We&s;t. p. 277. Knyghton. p. 2428.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER this &s;econd misfortune of the French, the Engli&s;h barons ha&s;ted every where to make terms of peace with the protector, and by an early &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, to prevent tho&s;e forfeitures, to which they were expo&s;ed on account of their re|bellion. Lewis, who&s;e cau&s;e was now totally de&s;perate, began to be anxious for the &s;afety of his per&s;on, and was glad, on any honourable conditions, to make his e&s;cape from a country, where he found, that every thing was now become ho&s;tile to him. He concluded a peace with Pembroke, promi&s;ed to evacuate the kingdom, and only &s;tipulated in return, an indemnity to his adherents, and a re&s;titution of their honours and fortunes, together with the free and equal en|joyment of tho&s;e liberties, which had been granted to the re&s;t of the nation<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer. vol. 1. p. 221.

THE precautions, which the King of France u&s;ed in the conduct of this whole affair, are remarkable. He pretended, that his &s;on had accepted of the offer from the Engli&s;h barons, without his advice, and contrary to his inclination: The armies &s;ent to England were levied in Lewis's name: When that prince came over to France for aid, his father publickly refu&s;ed to grant him any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and would not &s;o much as admit him to his pre&s;ence: Even after Henry's party acquired the a&s;cendant, and Lewis was in danger of falling into the hands of his enemies, it was Blanche of Ca&s;tile his wife, not the King his father, who rai&s;ed armies and equipped fleets for his &s;uccour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M.

All the&s;e arti|fices were employed, not to &s;atisfy the Pope; for he had too much penetration to be &s;o ea&s;ily impo&s;ed on: Nor yet to deceive the people; for they were too gro&s;s even for that purpo&s;e: They only &s;erved for a colouring to Philip's cau&s;e; and in public affairs, men are often better plea&s;ed, that the truth, tho' known to every body, &s;hould be wrapt up under a decent cover, than if it were expo&s;ed in open day-light to the eyes of all the world.</P>
<P>After the expul&s;ion of the French, the prudence and equity of the protector's &s;ub&s;equent conduct, contributed to cure entirely tho&s;e wounds, which had been made by inte&s;tine di&s;cord. He received the rebellious barons into favour; ob|&s;erved &s;trictly the terms of peace, which he had granted them; re&s;tored them to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and endeavoured, by an equal behaviour, to bury all pa&s;t ani|mo&s;ities in perpetual oblivion. The clergy alone, who had adhered to Lewis, were &s;ufferers in this revolution. As they had rebelled again&s;t their &s;overeign, the Pope, by di&s;regarding the interdict and excommunication, it was not in Pem|broke's power to make any &s;tipulations in their favour; and Gualo, the legate, prepared to take vengeance on them for their di&s;obedience<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Brady's App. N^o. 144.

<P>No one was more infamous for the&s;e violent and illegal practices than the earl of Albemarle, who, tho' he had early returned to his duty, and had been very &s;erviceable in expelling the French, augmented to the outmo&s;t of his power the ge eral licence, which prevailed; and committed outrages in all the counties of the north.

Pandulf, who was re&s;tored to his legate&s;hip in the place of Gualo, was active in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing this rebellion; and with the con|currence of eleven bi&s;hops, he denounced the &s;entence of excommunication again&s;t Albemarle and his adherents<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chron.

<P>THIS impolitic lenity, too frequent in tho&s;e times, was probably the re&s;ult of a combination among the barons, who never could endure to &s;ee the total ruin or one of their own order: But it encouraged Fawkes de Breaute, a man whom King John had rai&s;ed from a low origin, to per&s;evere in the cour&s;e of violence, to which he had owed his fortune, and to &s;et at nought all law and ju&s;tice.

<P>THE low &s;tate, into which the crown was now fallen, made it requi&s;ite for a good mini&s;ter to be attentive to the pre&s;ervation of the royal prerogatives, as well as to the &s;ecurity of public liberty. Hubert applied to the Pope, who had always great authority in the kingdom, and was now con&s;idered as its &s;uperior lord; and de&s;ired him to i&s;&s;ue a bull, declaring the King to be of full age, and entitled to

exerci&s;e in per&s;on all the acts of royalty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Paris p. 220.</NOTE>. In con&s;equence of this declaration, the ju&s;ticiary re&s;igned into Henry's hands the two important fortre&s;&s;es of the Tower and Dover ca&s;tle, which had been entru&s;ted to his cu&s;tody; and required the other barons to imitate his example. They refu&s;ed compliance: The earls of Che&s;ter and Albemarle, John Con&s;table of Che&s;ter, John de Lacy, Brian de l'I&s;le, and William de Cantel, with &s;ome others, even formed a con&s;piracy to &s;urprize London, and met in arms at Waltham with that intention: But finding the King prepared for defence, they de&s;i&s;ted from their enterprize. When &s;ummoned to court, in order to an&s;wer for their conduct, they &s;crupled not to appear, and to confe&s;s their de&s;ign: But they told the King, that they had no bad intentions again&s;t his per&s;on, but only again&s;t Hubert de Burgh, whom they were deter|mined to remove from his office<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chron.

The archbi&s;hop and the prelates, finding every thing tend towards a civil war, interpo&s;ed with their authority, and threatened the barons with the &s;entence of excommunication, if they per&s;i&s;ted in detaining the King's ca&s;tles. This menace at la&s;t prevailed: Mo&s;t of the fortre&s;&s;es were &s;urrendered; tho' the barons complained, that Hubert's ca&s;tles were &s;oon after re&s;tored to him, while the King &s;till kept theirs in his own cu&s;tody.

<P>It mu&s;t be acknowledged, that the influence of the prelates and the clergy was often of very great &s;ervice to the public. Tho' the religion of that age can merit no other name than that of &s;uper&s;tition, it &s;erved to unite together a body of men who had great &s;way over the people, and who kept the community from falling to pieces, from the factions and independant power of the nobles. And what was of great con&s;equence; it threw a mighty authority into the hands of men, who by their profe&s;&s;ion were aver&s;e to arms and violence; who tempered by their me|diation the general di&s;po&s;ition towards military enterprizes; and who &s;till main|tained, even amid&s;t the &s;hock of arms, tho&s;e &s;ecret links, without which it is impo&s;&s;ible for human &s;ociety to &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</P>

he employed to that purpo&s;e the fifteenth which had been granted him by par|liament. Lewis the eighth, who had &s;ucceeded to his father, Philip, in&s;tead of attending to Henry's claim, who demanded the re&s;titution of Normandy and the other provinces, wre&s;ted from England, made an irruption into Poictou, took Rochelle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer. vol. 1. p. 269.

Sali&s;bury &s;topt the progre&s;s of Lewis's arms, and retained the Poictevin and Ga&s;con va&s;&s;als in their allegiance: But no military action of any moment was performed on either &s;ide. The earl of Cornwal, after two years &s;tay in Guienne, returned to England.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1227" UNIT="year"> THIS prince was no wi&s;e turbulent or factious in his di&s;po&s;ition: His ruling pa&s;|&s;ion was to ama&s;s money, in which he &s;ucceeded &s;o well as to become the riche&s;t prince in Chri&s;tendom: Yet his attention to gain &s;ometimes threw him into acts of violence, and gave di&s;turbance to the government.

When objections were made to this novelty, he replied, that the Pope exerci&s;ed that authority; and why might he not imitate the example? But the abu&s;e, which the Pope made of his di&s;pen&s;ing power, in violating the Canons of general councils, in invading the privileges and cu&s;toms of all particular churches, and in u&s;urping on the rights of patrons, was more likely to excite the jealou&s;y of the people, than to reconcile them to a &s;imilar prac|tice in their civil government.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;contents of the barons.</NOTE> THE &s;ucce&s;sful revolt of the nobility from King John, and their impo&s;ing on him and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors limitations of the royal power, had made them feel their own weight and importance, had &s;et a dangerous precedent of re&s;i&s;tance, and being followed by a long minority, had impoveri&s;hed, as well as weakened that crown, which they were at la&s;t induced, from the fear of wor&s;e con&s;equences, to re-place on the head of young Henry. In the King's &s;ituation, either great abilities and vigour were requi&s;ite to overawe the barons, or great caution and re&s;erve to give them no pretence for complaints; and it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that this prince was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of neither of the&s;e talents. He had not prudence to choo&s;e right mea|&s;ures; he wanted even that con&s;tancy, which &s;ometimes gives weight to wrong ones; he was entirely abandoned to his favourites, who were always foreigners; he lavi&s;hed on them without di&s;cretion his dimini&s;hed revenue; and finding, that his barons indulged their di&s;po&s;ition towards tyranny, and ob&s;erved not to their own va&s;&s;als the &s;ame rules, which they had impo&s;ed on the crown, he was apt, in his admini&s;tration, to neglect all the &s;alutary articles of the great char|ter; which he remarked to be &s;o little regarded by his nobility. This conduct had extremely le&s;&s;ened his authority in the kingdom; had multiplied complaints again&s;t him; and had frequently expo&s;ed him to affronts, and even to danger|ous attempts upon his prerogative. In the year 1244, when he de&s;ired a &s;up|ply from parliament, the barons, complaining of the frequent breaches of the
<PB N="24" REF="30">
great charter, and of the many fruitle&s;s applications which they had formerly made for the redre&s;s of this and other grievances, demanded in return that he &s;hould give them the nomination of the great ju&s;ticiary and of the chancellor, to who&s;e hands chiefly the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice was committed; and, if we may credit the hi&s;torian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Math.

The King, to &s;atisfy them, would agree to nothing but a renewal of the char|ter, and a general permi&s;&s;ion to excommunicate all the violators of it: And he received no other &s;upply, except their con&s;ent to levy a &s;cutage of twenty &s;hil|lings on each knight's fee for the marriage of his elde&s;t daughter to the King of Scotland; a burthen, which was expre&s;sly annexed to their feudal tenures.</P>
<P>FOUR years after, in a very full parliament, when Henry demanded a new &s;up|ply, he was openly reproached with the breach of his word, and the frequent vi|olations of the charter. He was a&s;ked, whether he did not blu&s;h to de&s;ire any aid from his people, whom he profe&s;&s;edly hated and de&s;pi&s;ed, to whom on all occa|&s;ions he preferred aliens and foreigners, and who groaned under the oppre&s;&s;ions, which he either permitted or exerci&s;ed over them. He was told, that, be&s;ides di&s;paraging his nobility by forcing them to contract unequal and mean marriages with &s;trangers, no rank of men were &s;o low as to e&s;cape vexations from him or his mini&s;ters; that even the victuals con&s;umed in his hou&s;hold, the cloaths which him&s;elf and his &s;ervants wore, e&s;pecially the wine, which they u&s;ed, were all taken by violence from the lawful owners, and no compen&s;ation was ever made them for the injury; that foreign merchants, to the great prejudice and infamy of the kingdom, &s;hunned the Engli&s;h harbours, as if they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by pyrates, and the commerce with all nations was thus cut off by the&s;e violences; that lo&s;s was added to lo&s;s, and injury to injury, while the merchants, who had been de|&s;poiled of their goods, were al&s;o obliged to carry them at their own charges to whatever place the King was plea&s;ed to appoint them; that even the poor fi&s;h|ermen on the coa&s;t could not e&s;cape his oppre&s;&s;ions and tho&s;e of his courtiers, and finding that they had not the full liberty of di&s;po&s;ing of their commodities in the Eng i&s;h market, were frequently con&s;trained to carry them to foreign ports, and to hazard all the perils of the ocean rather than tho&s;e which awaited them from his oppre&s;&s;ive emi&s;&s;aries; and that his very religion was a ground of complaint to his &s;ubjects, while they ob&s;erved, that the waxen tapers and &s;plendid &s;ilks, employed in &s;o many u&s;ele&s;s proce&s;&s;ions, were the &s;poils which he had forcibly

Throughout this remon&s;trance, in which the complaints, derived from an abu&s;e of the antient right of purveyance, may be &s;up|po&s;ed to be &s;omewhat exaggerated, there appears a &s;trange mixture of regal ty|ranny in the practices which gave ri&s;e to it, and of ari&s;tocratical liberty or rather licentiou&s;ne&s;s in the expre&s;&s;ions employed by the parliament.

<P>As the King, in an&s;wer to their remon&s;trance, gave the parliament only good words and fair promi&s;es, attended with the mo&s;t humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, which they had often found deceitful, he obtained at that time no &s;upply; and therefore in the year 1253, when he found him&s;elf again under the nece&s;&s;ity of applying to parliament, he had provided him&s;elf of a new pretence, which he deemed infalli|ble, and taking the vow of a Croi&s;ade to the holy land, he demanded their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance in that pious enterprize<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">M.

<P>A recent quarrel, which broke out between Leice&s;ter and William de Valence, Henry's half brother, a chief favourite, brought matters to extremity<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">M.

He repre&s;ented to this company the nece&s;&s;ity of reforming the &s;tate, and of putting the execution of the laws into other hands than tho&s;e which had hitherto appeared from repeated experience, &s;o unfit for the charge, with which they were entru&s;ted. He exaggerated the oppre&s;&s;ions of the lower orders of the &s;tate, the violations of the barons' privileges, the conti|nued plunder of the clergy; and in order to aggravate the enormity of this con|duct, he appealed to the great charter, which Henry had &s;o often ratified, and which was calculated to prevent for ever the return of the&s;e intolerable grievan|ces. He magnified the genero&s;ity of their ance&s;tors, who, at an infinite expence of blood, had extorted that famous conce&s;&s;ion from the crown; but lamented their own degeneracy, who allowed &s;o great an advantage, once obtained, to be wre&s;ted from them by a weak prince and by in&s;olent &s;trangers.

<P>THE Pope was at that time very much di&s;&s;atisfied with the conduct of the ba|rons; who, in order to gain the favour of the people and clergy of England, had expelled all the Italian eccle&s;ia&s;tics, had confi&s;cated their benefices, and &s;eemed determined to maintain the liberties and privileges of the Engli&s;h church, in which the rights of patronage, belonging to their own families, were al&s;o included.

About the &s;ame time, that the barons at Oxford had an|nihilated the prerogatives of the monarchy, the clergy met in a &s;ynod at Merton, and pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal decrees, which were no le&s;s calculated to promote their own grandeur at the expence of the crown. They decreed, that it was unlawful to try the eccle&s;ia&s;tics by &s;ecular judges; that the clergy were not to regard any prohi|b tions from civil courts; that lay patrons had no right to confer &s;piritual bene|fices; that the magi&s;trate was obliged, without farther enquiry, to impri&s;on all excommunicated per&s;ons; and that antient u&s;age, without any particular grant or charter, was a &s;ufficient authority for any clerical po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions or privileges<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ann Burt. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">.</NOTE>.

they were with difficulty retained in &s;ubordination or even in peace; and almo&s;t throughout every reign &s;ince the conque&s;t, had infe&s;ted the Engli&s;h fron|tiers with &s;uch petty incur&s;ions and &s;udden inroads, as &s;eldom merited to have place in a general hi&s;tory. The Engli&s;h, &s;till contented with repelling their in|va&s;ions, and chacing them back into their barren mountains, had never pur&s;ued the advantages obtained again&s;t them, nor attempted, even under their greate&s;t and mo&s;t active princes, a total, or &s;o much as a feudal &s;ubjection of the coun|try. This advantage was re&s;erved to the pre&s;ent King, the weake&s;t and mo&s;t in|dolent. In the year 1237, Lewellen, prince of Wales, declining in years and broke with infirmities, but &s;till more harra&s;&s;ed with the rebellion and undutiful behaviour of his &s;on, Griffin, had recour&s;e to the protection of Henry; and con&s;enting to &s;ubject his principality, which had &s;o long maintained its indepen|dance, to va&s;&s;alage under the crown of England, purcha&s;ed &s;ecurity and tran|quillity on the&s;e di&s;honourable terms. His elde&s;t &s;on and heir, David, renew|ed the homage to England; and having taken his brother pri&s;oner, delivered him into Henry's hands, who committed him to cu&s;tody in the Tower. That prince, endeavouring to make his e&s;cape from confinement, lo&s;t his life in the attempt; and the prince of Wales, freed from the apprehen&s;ions of &s;o dangerous a rival, paid thenceforth le&s;s regard to the Engli&s;h monarch, and even renewed tho&s;e in|cur&s;ions, by which the Welch, during &s;o many ages, had been accu&s;tomed to in|fe&s;t their borders. Lewellyn, however, the &s;on of Griffin, who &s;ucceeded to his uncle, had been obliged to renew the homage, which was now claimed by Eng|land as an e&s;tabli&s;hed right; but he was well plea&s;ed to inflame tho&s;e civil di&s;|cords, on which he re&s;ted his pre&s;ent &s;ecurity, and founded his hopes of future independance. He entered into a confederacy with the earl of Leice&s;ter, and collecting all the force of his principality, invaded England with an army of 30,000 men. He ravaged the lands of Roger de Mortimer and of all the barons, who adhered to the crown<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chron.

But one of the principal re&s;ources of his faction was the populace of the cities, particularly of London; and as he had, by his hypocritical preten&s;ions to &s;anctity, and his zeal again&s;t Rome, engaged all the monks and lower eccle&s;ia&s;tics in his party, his dominion over the inferior ranks of men became ab&s;olutely uncontrolable.

<P>NO farther mention was made of the reference to the King of France, &s;o e&s;&s;en|tial an article in the agreement of Lewes; and Leice&s;ter &s;ummoned a parliament, compo&s;ed altogether of his own partizans, in order to rivet, by their authority, that power which he had acquired by &s;o much violence, and which he u&s;ed with &s;o much tyranny and inju&s;tice.

<P>BUT it was impo&s;&s;ible that things could long remain in this &s;trange &s;ituation. It behoved Leice&s;ter either to de&s;cend with &s;ome danger into the rank of a &s;ubject, or to mount up with no le&s;s into that of a &s;overeign; and his exorbitant ambition, unre&s;trained by any fear or principle, gave too much rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect him of the latter intention.

The Queen, whom her hu&s;band had left abroad, had collected in foreign parts an army of de&s;perate adventurers, and had a&s;&s;embled a great number of &s;hips, with a view of invading the kingdom, and of bringing relief to her unfortunate family.

<P>LEICESTER found him&s;elf better able to re&s;i&s;t the &s;piritual thunders, which were levelled again&s;t him. The Pope, &s;till adhering to the King's cau&s;e again&s;t the barons, di&s;patched cardinal Guido as his legate into England, with orders to excommunicate the three earls, Leice&s;ter, Gloce&s;ter, and Norfolk, by name, and all others in general, who concurred in the oppre&s;&s;ion and captivity of their &s;o|vereign<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 1. p. 798.

Leice&s;ter menaced the legate with death, if he &s;et his foot within the kingdom; but Guido, meeting in France the bi&s;hops of Winche&s;ter, London, and Worce&s;ter, who had been &s;ent thither on a negociation, commanded them, under the penalty of eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ures, to carry his bull into England, and to pub|li&s;h it again&s;t the barons. When the prelates arrived off the coa&s;t, they were boarded by the pyratical mariners of the cinque ports, to whom probably they gave a hint of the cargo, which they brought along with them: The bull was torn and thrown into the &s;ea; which furni&s;hed the artful prelates with a plau&s;ible excu&s;e for not obeying the orders of the legate<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 671. T. Wykes, p. 65.</NOTE>. Leice&s;ter appealed from Guido to the Pope in per&s;on; but before his amba&s;&s;adors could reach Rome to defend his cau&s;e, the Pope was dead, and they found the legate him&s;elf, from whom they had appealed, &s;eated on the papal throne, under the name of Urban IV. That daring leader was no wi&s;e di&s;mayed with this event; and as he found that a great part of his popularity in England was founded on his oppo&s;ition to Rome, which was now become odious, he per&s;i&s;ted with the more ob&s;tinacy in the pro|&s;ecution of his mea&s;ures.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1265" UNIT="year"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">20th January.</NOTE> THAT he might both encrea&s;e, and turn to advantage his popularity, Leice&s;ter &s;ummoned a new parliament in London, where he knew his power was uncon|trolable; he fixed this a&s;&s;embly on a more democratical ba&s;is, than any which had ever been &s;ummoned &s;ince the foundation of the Engli&s;h monarchy.

But Leice&s;ter's policy, if we mu&s;t a&s;cribe to him &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing, only forwarded by &s;ome years an in&s;titution, for which the general &s;tate of things had already prepared the nation; and it is otherwi&s;e incon|ceivable, that a plant, &s;et by &s;o inau&s;picious a hand, could have attained to &s;o vi|gorous a growth, and have flouri&s;hed in the mid&s;t of &s;uch tempe&s;ts and convul|&s;ions. The feudal &s;y&s;tem, with which the liberty, much more the power of the commons, was totally incompatible, began gradually to decline; and both King and people, who felt its inconveniences, contributed to favour this new power, which was more &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive than the barons to the regular authority of the crown, and at the &s;ame time afforded protection to the inferior orders of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>LEICESTER, having thus a&s;&s;embled a parliament of his own model, and tru&s;t|ing to the attachment of the populace of London, &s;eized the opportunity of cru&s;hing his rivals among the powerful barons.

This known divi&s;ion among the leaders, gave courage to all Leice&s;ter's enemies and to the King's friends; who were now &s;ure of protection from &s;o potent a leader. Tho' Roger Mortimer, Hamon L'e&s;trange, and other powerful marchers of Wales, had been obliged to leave the kingdom, their au|thority &s;till remained over the territories &s;ubjected to their juri&s;diction; and there were many others who were di&s;po&s;ed to give di&s;turbance to the new government.

<P>A total victory of the &s;overeign over &s;o exten&s;ive a rebellion commonly pro|duces a revolution of government, and &s;trengthens, as well as enlarges, for &s;ome time, the prerogatives of the crown: Yet no &s;acrifices of national liberty were made on this occa&s;ion; the great charter remained &s;till inviolate; and the King, &s;en&s;ible that his own barons, by who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance alone he had prevailed, were no le&s;s jealous of their independance than the other party, &s;eems thenceforth to have more carefully ab&s;tained from all tho&s;e exertions of arbitrary power, which had afforded &s;o plau&s;ible a pretence to the rebels.

From this &s;ource, rather than from in&s;in|cerity or treachery, aro&s;e his negligence in ob&s;erving his promi&s;es; and he was
<PB N="54" REF="60">
too ea&s;ily induced, for the &s;ake of pre&s;ent convenience, to &s;acrifice the la&s;ting advan|tages ari&s;ing from the tru&s;t and confidence of his people.

In|&s;tead of reducing the dangerous power of his nobles, by obliging them to ob&s;erve the laws towards their inferiors, and &s;etting them the &s;alutary example in his own government; he was &s;educed to imitate their conduct, and to make his ar|bitrary will, or rather that of his mini&s;ters, the rule of his actions. In&s;tead of accommodating him&s;elf, by a &s;trict frugality, to the embarra&s;&s;ed &s;ituation in which his revenue had been left, by the military expeditions of his uncle, the di&s;&s;ipa|tions of his father, and the u&s;urpations of the barons; he was tempted to le|vy money by irregular exactions, which, without inriching him&s;elf, impoveri&s;h|ed, at lea&s;t di&s;gu&s;ted his people. Of all men, nature &s;eemed lea&s;t to have fitted him for being a tyrant; yet are there in&s;tances of oppre&s;&s;ion in his reign, which, tho' derived from the precedents left him by his predece&s;&s;ors, had been carefully guarded again&s;t by the great charter, and are incon&s;i&s;tent with all rules of good government. And on the whole, we may &s;ay, that greater abilities with his good di&s;po&s;itions, would have prevented him from falling into his faults; or with wor&s;e di&s;po&s;itions, would have enabled him to maintain and defend them.</P>
<P>THIS prince was noted for his piety and devotion, and his regular attendance on public wor&s;hip; and a &s;aying of his on that head is much celebrated by an|tient writers. He was engaged in a di&s;pute with Lewis IX. of France, concern|ing the preference between &s;ermons and ma&s;&s;es: He maintained the &s;uperiority of the latter, and affirmed, that he would rather have one hour's conver&s;ation with a friend, than hear twenty the mo&s;t elaborate di&s;cour&s;es, pronounced in prai&s;e of him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mi&s;cellaneous tran&s;ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ions of this reign.</NOTE> THE following are the mo&s;t remarkable laws enacted during this reign. There had been great di&s;putes between the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts about ba&s;tar|dy. The common law had deemed all tho&s;e ba&s;tards who were born before wedlock: By the canon law they were ligitimate: And when any di&s;pute of in|heritance aro&s;e, it had been formerly u&s;ual for the civil courts to i&s;&s;ue writs to the &s;piritual, directing them to enquire into the legitimacy of the per&s;on. The bi&s;hop always returned an an&s;wer agreeable to the canon law, tho' contrary to
<PB N="55" REF="61">
the municipal law of the kingdom. For this rea&s;on, the civil courts had chang|ed the nature of their writ, and in&s;tead of requiring the &s;piritual courts to en|quire concerning the legitimacy of the per&s;on, they only propo&s;ed the &s;imple que&s;|tion of fact, whether he was born before or after the marriage. The prelates complained of this practice to the parliament a&s;&s;embled at Merton in the twen|tieth of this King, and de&s;ired that the civil law might be rendered conformable to the canon: But received from all the nobility the memorable reply: <HI>Nolumus leges Angliae mutare:</HI> We will not change the laws of England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Statute of Merton, chap. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER the civil wars, the parliament, &s;ummoned at Marlebridge, gave their approbation to mo&s;t of the ordinances, which had been enacted by the reforming barons, and which, tho' advantageous to the &s;ecurity of the people, had not re|ceived the &s;anction of a proper authority. Among other laws, it was there en|acted, that all appeals from the courts of inferior lords &s;hould be carried directly to the King's courts, without pa&s;&s;ing thro' the courts of the lords immediately &s;uperior<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Statute of Marleb. chap 20.</NOTE>. It was ordained that money &s;hould bear no intere&s;t during the mino|rity of the creditor<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Id. Chap. 16.</NOTE>. This law was very rea&s;onable, as the e&s;tates of minors were always in the hands of their lords, and the creditors could not pay intere&s;t where they had no revenue. The charter of King John had granted this indulgence: It was omitted in that of Henry III. for what rea&s;on is unknown; but it was renewed in the &s;tatute of Marlebridge. Mo&s;t of the other articles of this &s;tatute are calculated to re&s;train the oppre&s;&s;ions of &s;heriffs, and the violences and iniqui|ties committed in di&s;training cattle and other goods. Cattle and the in&s;truments of hu&s;bandry compo&s;ed at that time the chief riches of the people.</P>
<P>IN the 35th year of this King an a&s;&s;ize was fixed of bread, the price of which was &s;ettled, according to the different prices of corn, from one &s;hilling a quar|ter to &s;even &s;hillings and &s;ix pence<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Statutes at large, p. 6.</NOTE>. The&s;e great variations alone are a proof of bad tillage: Yet did the prices often ri&s;e much higher, than any taken notice of by the laws. The Chronicle of Dun&s;table tells us, that in this reign, wheat was once &s;old for a mark, nay for a pound a quarter; that is, three pounds of our pre&s;ent money<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">So al&s;o Knyghton, p. 2444.</NOTE>. The &s;ame law affords us a proof of the little communication between the parts of the kingdom, by remarking the very different prices which the &s;ame commodity bore at the &s;ame time. A brewer, &s;ays the &s;tatute, may &s;ell two gallons of ale for a penny in cities, and three or four gallons for the &s;ame price in the country. At pre&s;ent, &s;uch commodities, by the great con&s;umpt of the people, and the great &s;tocks of the brewers, are rather cheape&s;t in cities. The
<PB N="56" REF="62">
Chronicle of Dun&s;table ob&s;erves, that wheat one year was &s;old in many places for eight &s;hillings a quarter, but never ro&s;e in Dun&s;table above a crown.</P>
<P>THO' commerce was &s;till very low, it &s;eems rather to have encrea&s;ed &s;ince the Conque&s;t; at lea&s;t, if we may judge of the encrea&s;e of money by the price of bread. The medium between the highe&s;t and lowe&s;t prices of wheat, a&s;&s;igned by the &s;tatute, is four &s;hillings and three pence a quarter, that is, twelve &s;hillings and nine pence of our pre&s;ent money. This is near the half of the middling price in our time. Yet the middling price of cattle, &s;o late as the reign of King Richard, we found to be above eight times lower than the pre&s;ent. Is not the true inference, from comparing the&s;e facts, that in all uncivilized nations, cattle, which propagate of them&s;elves, bear always a lower price than corn, which re|quires more art and &s;tock to rai&s;e it, than the&s;e nations are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of? It is to be remarked, that Henry's a&s;&s;ize of corn was copied from a preceding a&s;&s;ize e&s;tabli&s;hed by King John; and con&s;equently, the prices which we have here com|pared of corn and cattle may be looked on as contemporary; and they were drawn, not from one particular year, but from an e&s;timation of the middling prices. It is true, the prices, a&s;&s;igned by the a&s;&s;ize of Richard, were meant as a &s;tandard for the accompts of &s;heriffs and e&s;cheators; and as con&s;iderable pro|fits were allowed to them, we may naturally &s;uppo&s;e, that the common value of cattle was &s;omewhat higher: Yet &s;till, &s;o great a difference between the prices of corn and cattle as that of four to one, compared to the pre&s;ent rates, affords im|portant reflections concerning the very different &s;tate of indu&s;try and tillage in the two periods.</P>
<P>INTEREST had in that age mounted to an enormous height, as might be ex|pected from the barbari&s;m of the times and mens ignorance of commerce. There are in&s;tances of fifty per cent. payed for money<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 586.</NOTE>. Such profits tempted the Jews to remain in England, notwith&s;tanding the grievous oppre&s;&s;ions to which they were continually expo&s;ed from the prevalent bigotry and rapine of the age. It is ea&s;y to imagine how precarious their &s;tate mu&s;t be under an indigent prince, &s;omewhat re&s;trained in his tyranny over his native &s;ubjects, but who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an unlimited authority over them, the &s;ole proprietors of money in the kingdom, and hated on account of their riches, their religion, and their u&s;ury: Yet will our ideas &s;carce come up to the extortions which in fact we &s;hall find to have been practiced upon them. In the year 1241, 20,000 marks were exacted from them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">M.

<P>To give a better pretence to extortions, the improbable and ab&s;urd accu&s;ation, which has been at different times advanced again&s;t that nation, was revived in England, that they had crucified a child in deri&s;ion of our Saviour's &s;ufferings.

<P>Commerce mu&s;t be in a wretched condition where intere&s;t was &s;o high, and where the &s;ole proprietors of money were expo&s;ed to &s;uch rapine and inju&s;tice.

In 1249, &s;ome years before the in&s;ur|rection of the barons, two merchants of Brabant came to the King at Winche&s;ter, and told him, that they had been de&s;poiled of all their goods by certain robbers,

whom they knew, becau&s;e they &s;aw their faces every day in his court; that like practices prevailed all over England, and travellers were every day robbed, bound, wounded and murdered; that the&s;e crimes e&s;caped with impunity, becau&s;e the mi|ni&s;ters of ju&s;tice them&s;elves were in a confederacy with the robbers; and that they for their part, in&s;tead of bringing matters to a fruitle&s;s trial by law, were willing, tho' merchants, to try their cau&s;e with the robbers by arms and a duel. The King, provoked at the&s;e abu&s;es, ordered a jury to be inclo&s;ed, and to try the robbers: The jury, tho' con&s;i&s;ting of twelve men of property in Hamp&s;hire, were found to be al&s;o in a confederacy with the robbers, and acquitted them.

<P>ONE can the le&s;s repine, during the prevalence of &s;uch manners, at the frauds and forgeries of the clergy; as it gives much le&s;s di&s;turbance to &s;ociety, to take mens money from them with their own con&s;ent, tho' by deceits and lies, than to ravi&s;h it by open force and violence. During this reign, the papal power was at its &s;ummit, and was even beginning in&s;en&s;ibly to decline, by rea&s;on of the immea|&s;urable avarice and extortions of the court of Rome, which di&s;gu&s;ted the clergy as well as laity in every kingdom of Europe. England it&s;elf, tho' &s;unk in the deepe&s;t aby&s;s of ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition, had &s;eriou&s;ly entertained thoughts of &s;haking off the papal yoke<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">M.

to defend them&s;elves, but &s;ome &s;mall remains of common &s;en&s;e, which pa&s;&s;ed for profanene&s;s and impiety, and the indelible regard to &s;elf-intere&s;t, which, as it was the &s;ole motive in the prie&s;ts for framing the&s;e impo&s;tures, &s;erved al&s;o, in &s;ome degree, to protect the laity again&s;t them.</P>
<P>ANOTHER expedient, devi&s;ed by the church of Rome in this period for &s;ecur|ing its power, was the in&s;titution of new religious orders, and chiefly the Domi|nicans and Franci&s;cans, who proceeded with all the zeal and &s;ucce&s;s that attend novelties; were better qualified to gain the populace than the old orders, now be|come rich and indolent; maintained a perpetual rival&s;hip with each other in promot|ing their gainful &s;uper&s;titions; and acquired a great dominion over the minds, and con&s;equently over the pur&s;es of men, by counterfeiting a de&s;ire of poverty and a contempt for riches. The quarrels, which aro&s;e between the&s;e orders, lying &s;till under the controul of the &s;overeign pontiff, never di&s;turbed the peace of the church, and &s;erved only as a &s;pur to their indu&s;try in promoting the common cau&s;e; and tho' the Dominicans lo&s;t &s;ome popularity by their denial of the immaculate con|ception, a point in which they unwarily engaged too far to be able to recede with honour, they counterballanced this di&s;advantage by acquiring more &s;olid e&s;tab|li&s;hments, by gaining the confidence of kings and princes, and by exerci&s;ing the juri&s;diction a&s;&s;igned them, of ultimate judges and puni&s;hers of here&s;y. Thus, the &s;everal orders of monks became a kind of regular troops or garri&s;ons of the Romi&s;h church; and tho' the temporal intere&s;ts of &s;ociety, &s;till more tho&s;e of true piety, were hurt by their various devices to catch the populace, they proved the chief &s;upports of that mighty fabric of &s;uper&s;tition, and till the revival of true learning, &s;ecured it from any dangerous inva&s;ion.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><MILESTONE N="1272" UNIT="year"> THE Engli&s;h were as yet &s;o little trained to obedience under a regular govern|ment, that the death of almo&s;t every King, &s;ince the Conque&s;t, had been attended with di&s;orders; and the council, reflecting on the recent civil wars, and on the animo&s;ities which naturally remain after the&s;e great convul&s;ions, had rea|&s;on to apprehend very dangerous con&s;equences from the ab&s;ence of the &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Henry. They therefore ha&s;tened to proclaim prince Edward, to &s;wear allegiance to him, and to &s;ummon the &s;tates of the kingdom, in order to provide for the public peace in this important conjuncture<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 2. p. 1. Wal&s;ing. p. 43. Trevet, p. 239.</NOTE>. Walter Giffard, archbi&s;hop of York, the earl of Cornwal, &s;on of Richard, King of the Romans, and the earl of Gloce&s;ter, were appointed guardians of the kingdom, and pro|ceeded peaceably to the exerci&s;e of their authority, without either meeting with oppo&s;ition from any of the people, or being di&s;turbed with emulation and fac|tion among them&s;elves. The high character acquired by Edward during the late commotions, his military genius, his &s;ucce&s;s in &s;ubduing the rebels, his modera|tion in &s;ettling the kingdom, had procured him great e&s;teem, mixt with affec|tion, among all orders of men; and no one could rea&s;onably entertain hopes of making any advantage of his ab&s;ence, or of rai&s;ing di&s;turbance in the nation. The earl of Gloce&s;ter him&s;elf, who&s;e great power, and turbulent &s;pirit, had ex|cited
<PB N="61" REF="67">
mo&s;t jealou&s;y, was forward to give proofs of his allegiance; and any male|contents, who remained, being de&s;titute of a leader, were obliged to remain in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the government.</P>
<P>Prince Edward had reached Sicily in his return from the Holy Land, when he received information of the death of his father; and he di&s;covered a deep con|cern on this occa&s;ion. At the &s;ame time, he learned the death of an infant &s;on, John, whom his prince&s;s, Eleanor of Ca&s;tile, had born him at Acre in Pale&s;|tine; and as he appeared much le&s;s affected with that misfortune, the King of Sicily expre&s;&s;ed a &s;urprize at this difference of &s;entiment: But was told by Ed|ward, that the death of a &s;on was a lo&s;s which he might hope to repair; the death of a father was a lo&s;s irreparable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingh. p. 44. Trevet, p. 240.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>EDWARD proceeded homewards; but as he &s;oon learned the quiet &s;ettlement of the kingdom, he was in no hurry to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne, but &s;pent near a year in France, before he made his appearance in England. <MILESTONE N="1273" UNIT="year"> In his pa&s;|&s;age by Chalons in Burgundy, he was challenged by the prince of that country to a tournament which he was preparing; and as Edward excelled in the&s;e martial and dangerous exerci&s;es, the true image of war, he declined not the oppor|tunity of acquiring honour and renown, in that great a&s;&s;embly of the neighbour|ing nobles. But the image of war was here unfortunately turned into the thing it&s;elf. Edward and his retinue were &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in the jou&s;ts, that the French knights, provoked at their &s;uperiority, made a &s;erious attack upon them, which was repul&s;ed, and a good deal of blood was idly &s;hed in the quarrel<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 44. Trevet, p. 241. M. We&s;t. p. 402.</NOTE>. This ren|counter received the name of the petty battle of Chalons.</P>
<P>EDWARD went from Chalons to Paris, and did homage to Philip for the do|minions which he held in France<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;in. p. 45.</NOTE>. <MILESTONE N="1274" UNIT="year"> He thence returned to Guienne, and gave a &s;ettlement to that province, which was in &s;ome confu&s;ion. He made his journey by land into England; in his pa&s;&s;age he accommodated at Montreuil a difference with Margaret, counte&s;s of Flanders, heire&s;s of that territory<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 2. p. 32, 33.</NOTE>; <NOTE PLACE="marg">19th Augu&s;t.</NOTE> he was receiv|ed with joyful acclamations by his people, and was &s;olemnly crowned at We&s;tmin|&s;ter by Robert, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil admini|&s;tration of the King.</NOTE> THE King immediately applied him&s;elf to the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of his kingdom, and to the correcting of tho&s;e di&s;orders, which the civil commotions and the loo&s;e admini&s;tration of his father had introduced into every part of government. The plan of his policy was equally generous and prudent. He con&s;idered the great barons both as the immediate rivals of the crown, and the oppre&s;&s;ors of the peo|ple;
<PB N="62" REF="68">
and he propo&s;ed by an exact di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice, and a rigid execution of the laws, to give at once protection to the inferior orders of the &s;tate, and to di|mini&s;h the arbitrary power of the great, on which their dangerous authority was chiefly founded. Making it a rule of his own conduct to ob&s;erve, except on ex|traordinary occa&s;ions, the privileges &s;ecured to them by the great charter, he acquired a right to in&s;i&s;t upon their ob&s;ervance of the &s;ame charter towards their va&s;&s;als and inferiors; and he made the crown be regarded by all the gentry and commonalty of the kingdom, as the great fountain of ju&s;tice, and the gene|ral a&s;&s;ylum again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion. <MILESTONE N="1275" UNIT="year"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">16th Feb.</NOTE> Be&s;ides enacting &s;everal excellent &s;tatutes, in a parliament which he &s;ummoned at We&s;tmin&s;ter, he took care to in&s;pect the con|duct of all his magi&s;trates and judges, to di&s;place &s;uch as were either negligent or corrupt, to provide them with &s;ufficient force for the execution of ju&s;tice, to root out all bands and confederacies of robbers, and to repre&s;s tho&s;e more &s;ilent robberies, which were committed either by the power of the nobles, or under the countenance of public authority. By this rigid admini&s;tration, the face of the kingdom was &s;oon changed; and order and ju&s;tice took place of violence and op|pre&s;&s;ion: But amid&s;t the excellent in&s;titutions and public-&s;pirited plans of Ed|ward, there &s;till appears &s;omewhat both of the &s;everity of his per&s;onal character, and of the prejudices of the times.</P>
<P>AS the various kinds of malefactors, the murderers, robbers, incendiaries, ravi&s;h|ers, and plunderers, had become &s;o numerous and powerful, that the ordinary mini|&s;ters of ju&s;tice, e&s;pecially in the we&s;tern counties, were afraid to execute the laws again&s;t them, the King found it nece&s;&s;ary to provide an extraordinary remedy for the evil; and he erected for the puni&s;hment of crimes a new tribunal, which, however u&s;eful, would have been deemed, in times of more regular liberty, a very great &s;tretch of illegal and arbitrary power. It con&s;i&s;ted of commi&s;&s;ioners, who were empowered to enquire into di&s;orders and crimes of all kinds, and to inflict the proper puni&s;hments upon them. The officers, charged with this unu&s;ual commi&s;&s;ion, made their circuits throughout the counties of England mo&s;t infected with this evil, and carried terror into all tho&s;e parts of the king|dom. In their zeal to puni&s;h crimes, they did not &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;h between the innocent and guilty; the &s;malle&s;t &s;u&s;picion became the ground of accu&s;ation and trial; the &s;lighte&s;t evidence was received again&s;t criminals; the pri&s;ons were crowded with malefactors, real or pretended; &s;evere fines were levied for &s;mall offences; and the King, tho' his exhau&s;ted revenue was &s;upplied by this expedient, found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;top the cour&s;e of &s;o great rigour, and after terrifying and
<PB N="63" REF="69">
di&s;&s;ipating by this tribunal the gangs of di&s;orderly people in England, he very prudently annuiled the commi&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spellman's Glo&s;&s;. in verbo Trailba&s;ton. But Spellman was either mi&s;taken in placing this com|mi&s;&s;ion in the fifth year of the King, or it was renewed in 1305. See Rymer, vol. 2. p. 960. Tri|vet. p. 338. M. We&s;t. p. 450.</NOTE>; and never afterwards renewed it.</P>
<P>AMONG the various di&s;orders, to which the kingdom was &s;ubject, no one was more univer&s;ally complained of than the adulteration of the coin; and as this crime required more art than the Engli&s;h of that age, who chiefly employed force and violence in their iniquities, were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, the imputation fell chiefly upon the Jews<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;in, p. 48. Heming, vol. 1. p. 6.</NOTE>. Edward al&s;o &s;eems to have indulged a &s;trong prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again&s;t that nation; and this ill-judged zeal for Chri&s;tianity being naturally augmented by an expedition to the Holy Land, he let loo&s;e the whole rigour of his ju&s;tice again&s;t this unhappy people. Two hundred and eighty of them were hanged at once for this crime in London alone, be&s;ides tho&s;e who &s;uffered in other parts of the king|dom<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">T. Wykes, p. 107.</NOTE>. The hou&s;es and lands, (for the Jews had of late ventured to make purcha&s;es of that kind) as well as the goods of great multitudes, were &s;old and confi&s;cated: And the King, left it &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected, that the riches of the &s;ufferers were the chief part of their guilt, ordered one half of the money, rai&s;ed by the&s;e confi&s;|cations, to be &s;et apart, and be&s;towed upon &s;uch as were willing to be converted to Chri&s;tianity. But the re&s;entment of their injuries was more prevalent over them, than the temptation from their poverty; and very few of them could be induced by intere&s;t to embrace the religion of their per&s;ecutors. The mi&s;eries of this people were not here terminated. Tho' the arbitrary talliages and exac|tions levied upon them, had yielded a con&s;tant and a con&s;iderable revenue to the crown; Edward, prompted by his zeal and rapacity, re&s;olved &s;ome time after<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">In the year 1. 290.</NOTE> to purge the kingdom entirely of that hated race, and to &s;eize to him&s;elf at once their whole property as the reward of his labour<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;in, p. 54. Heming, vol. 1. p. 20. Trivet, p. 266.</NOTE>. He left them only money &s;uf|ficient to bear their charges into foreign countries, where new per&s;ecutions and extortions awaited them: But the inhabitants of the cinque ports, imitating the bigotry and avidity of their &s;overeign, de&s;poiled mo&s;t of them of this &s;mall pit|tance, and even threw many of the Jews into the &s;ea: A crime, for which the King, who was determined to be the &s;ole plunderer in his dominions, inflicted a capital puni&s;hment upon them. No le&s;s than fifteen thou&s;and Jews were at this time robbed of their effects and bani&s;hed the kingdom: Very few of that nation have &s;ince lived in England: And as it is impo&s;&s;ible for a kingdom to &s;ub|&s;i&s;t without lenders of money, and none will lend without a compen&s;ation, the practice of u&s;ury, as it was then called, was thenceforth exerci&s;ed by the Engli&s;h

them&s;elves, upon their fellow-citizens, or by Lombards and other foreigners. It is very much to be que&s;tioned whether the dealings of the&s;e new u&s;urers were equally open and unexceptionable with tho&s;e of the old. By a law of Richard, it was enacted, that three copies &s;hould be made of every bond given to a Jew; one to be put into the hands of a public magi&s;trate, another into tho&s;e of a man of credit, and a third to remain with the Jew him&s;elf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Trivet. p. 128.</NOTE> But as the canon law, &s;econded by the municipal, permitted no Chri&s;tian to receive intere&s;t, all tran&s;ac|tions of this kind mu&s;t, after the bani&s;hment of the Jews, have become more &s;e|cret and clande&s;tine, and the lender, of con&s;equence, be paid both for the u&s;e of his money, and for the infamy and danger which he incurred by lending it.</P>
<P>THE great poverty of the crown, tho' no excu&s;e, was probably the cau&s;e of this egregious tyranny exerci&s;ed again&s;t the Jews; but Edward practi&s;ed al&s;o other more honourable means of remedying that evil. He employed a &s;trict frugality in the management and di&s;tribution of his revenue: He engaged the parliament to vote him a fifteenth of all moveables; the Pope to grant him the tenth of all eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues for three years; and the merchants to con&s;ent to a per|petual impo&s;ition of half a mark on every &s;ack of wool exported, and a mark on three hundred &s;kins. He al&s;o i&s;&s;ued commi&s;&s;ions to enquire into all encroach|ments on the royal deme&s;ne; into the value of e&s;cheats, forfeitures, and ward|&s;hips; and into the means of repairing or improving every branch of the reve|nue<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ann. Waverl p. 235.</NOTE>. The commi&s;&s;ioners, in the execution of their office, began to carry mat|ters too far again&s;t the nobility, and to que&s;tion the titles to e&s;tates, which had been tran&s;mitted from father to &s;on for &s;everal generations. Earl Warrenne, who had done &s;uch eminent &s;ervice in the late reign, being required to &s;how his titles, drew his &s;word; and &s;ubjoined, that William, the Norman, had not conquered the kingdom for him&s;elf alone; his ance&s;tor was a joint adventurer in the cau&s;e; and he him&s;elf was determined to maintain what had from that period remained unque&s;tioned in his family.

In the general accommodation, made with the van|qui&s;hed,
<PB N="65" REF="71">
Lewellyn had al&s;o obtained his pardon; but as he was the mo&s;t power|ful, and therefore the mo&s;t obnoxious va&s;&s;al of the crown, he had rea&s;on to en|tertain anxiety about his &s;ituation, and to dread the future effects of re&s;entment and jealou&s;y in the Engli&s;h monarchs. For this rea&s;on, he had determined to provide for his &s;ecurity by maintaining a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence with his former a&s;&s;ociates; and he even made his addre&s;&s;es to a daughter of the earl of Leice&s;ter, who was &s;ent to him from beyond &s;ea, but being intercepted in her pa&s;&s;age near the i&s;les of Scilly, was detained in the court of England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;in. p. 46, 47.

This incident en|crea&s;ing the mutual jealou&s;y between Edward and Lewellyn, the latter, when required to come to England, and do homage to the new King, &s;crupled to put him&s;elf into the hands of an enemy, de&s;ired a &s;afe conduct from Ed|ward, in&s;i&s;ted upon having the King's &s;on and other noblemen delivered to him as ho&s;tages, and demanded, that his &s;pou&s;e &s;hould be previou&s;ly &s;et at liberty<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 2. p. 68. Wal&s;in. p. 46. Trivet. p. 247.</NOTE>. The King, having now brought the &s;tate to a full &s;ettlement, was not di&s;plea&s;ed with this occa&s;ion of exerci&s;ing his authority, and &s;ubduing entirely the principa|lity of Wales. He refu&s;ed all Lewellyn's demands, except that of a &s;afe conduct; &s;ent him repeated &s;ummons to perform the duty of a va&s;&s;al; levied an army to reduce him to obedience; obtained a new aid of a fifteenth from parliament; and marched out with certain a&s;&s;urance of &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t the enemy. <MILESTONE N="1277" UNIT="year"> Be&s;ides the great di&s;proportion of force between the kingdom and principality, the circum&s;tances of the two &s;lates were now entirely rever&s;ed; and the &s;ame inte&s;tine di&s;&s;entions, which had formerly weakened England, now prevailed in Wales, and had even taken place in the reigning family. David and Roderic, brothers to Lewellyn, had been di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their inheritance by that prince, had been obliged to have recour&s;e to the protection of Edward, and &s;econded with all their intere&s;t, which was exten&s;ive, his attempts to en&s;lave their native country. The Wel&s;h prince had no other re&s;ource but in the inacce&s;&s;ible &s;ituation of his mountains, which had hitherto, thro' many ages, defended his forefathers again&s;t all the attempts of the Saxon and Norman conquerors; and he retired among the hills of Snow|dun, re&s;olute to defend him&s;elf to the la&s;t extremity. But Edward equally vigorous and cautious, entering by the north with a formidable army, pierced into the heart of the country; and having carefully explored every road before him, and &s;ecured every pa&s;s behind him, approached the Wel&s;h army in its la&s;t retreat. He here avoided the putting to trial the valour of a nation, proud of its antient independance, and enflamed with animo&s;ity again&s;t its hereditary enemies; and he tru&s;ted to the &s;low, but &s;ure effects of famine, for reducing that people to

<P>EACH age has its peculiar mode in conducting bu&s;ine&s;s; and men, guided more by cu&s;tom than by rea&s;on, follow, without enquiry, the manners, which are pre|valent in their own time.

It was thus that the Engli&s;h king and barons, in the forgoing reign, had endeavoured to compo&s;e their dome&s;tic di&s;&s;en&s;ions by a re|ference to the King of France; and the celebrated integrity of that monarch had prevented all the bad effects, which might naturally have been dreaded from &s;o perilous an expedient.

He well knew, that, if this preten&s;ion was once &s;ubmitted to, as it &s;eemed difficult in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of Scotland to oppo&s;e it, the ab&s;olute &s;overeignty of that kingdom, (which had been the ca&s;e with Wales) would &s;oon follow; and that one great va&s;&s;al, cooped up in an i&s;land with his liege lord, without re&s;ource from foreign powers, without aid from any fellow va&s;&s;als, could not long main|tain his dominions again&s;t the efforts of a mighty kingdom, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by all the cavils which the feudal law afforded his &s;uperior again&s;t him.

Yet even in this method of proceeding, which mu&s;t have di&s;covered to him&s;elf the inju&s;tice of his claim, he was far from being fortunate.

His authorities from the Norman period were, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till le&s;s conclu|&s;ive: The hi&s;torians indeed make frequent mention of an homage paid by the nor|thern potentate; but no one of them &s;ays that it was done for his kingdom, and &s;everal of them declare, in expre&s;s terms, that it was relative only to the fiefs which he enjoyed &s;outh of the Tweed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 492, 662.

<P>WHEN William, King of Scotland, was taken pri&s;oner in the battle of Aln|wic, he was obliged, for the recovery of his liberty, to &s;wear fealty to the vic|tor for his crown it&s;elf. The deed was performed according to all the rites of the feudal law: The record was pre&s;erved in the Engli&s;h archives, as well as mentioned by all the hi&s;torians: But as it is the only one of the kind, and as hi&s;to|rians &s;peak of this &s;uperiority as a great acqui&s;ition gained by the fortunate arms of Henry II.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Neubr. lib. 2. cap. 4.

Its &s;ubjection continued a very few years: King Richard, de&s;irous, before his departure for the Holy Land, to conciliate the friend&s;hip of William, renounced that homage, which he &s;ays in expre&s;s terms, had been <HI>extorted</HI> by his father; and he only retained the u&s;ual homage, which had been done by the Scotti&s;h princes for the lands, which they held in England.</P>

There cannot be the lea&s;t que&s;tion, that the homage u&s;ually paid by the kings of Scotland was not for their crown, but for &s;ome other territory. The only que&s;tion re|mains, what that territory was? It was not always for the earldom of Huntington, nor the honour of Penryth; becau&s;e we find it &s;ometimes done at a time when the&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were not in the hands of the kings of Scotland. It is probable, that the homage was performed in general terms without any particular &s;pecification of territory; and this inaccuracy had proceeded either from &s;ome di&s;pute be|tween the two kings about the territory and &s;ome oppo&s;ite claims, which were compromi&s;ed by the general homage, or from the fimplicity of the age, which employed few words in every tran&s;action. To prove this we need but look into the letter of King Richard, where he re&s;igns the homage of Scotland, re&s;erving the u&s;ual homage. His words are, <HI>Saepedictus W. Rex ligius homo no&s;ter deveniat de omnibus terris de quibus antece&s;&s;ores &s;ui antece&s;&s;orum no&s;trorum ligii homenes fuerunt, et nobis atque baeredi|bus no&s;tris fideletatem jurarunt.</HI> Rymer, vol: 1. p. 65. The&s;e general terms were probably copied from the u&s;ual form of the homage it&s;elf,</P>
<P>It is no proof that the kings of Scotland po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no lands nor baronies in England, becau&s;e we can|not find them in the imperfect hi&s;tories and records of that age. For in&s;tance, it appears clearly from another pa&s;&s;age of this very letter of Richard, that the Scotti&s;h King had lands both in the county of Huntington and el&s;ewhere in England; tho' the earldom of Huntington it&s;elf was then in the per&s;on of his brother, David; and we know at pre&s;ent of no other baronies, which William held. It cannot be expected that we &s;hould now be able to &s;pecify all his fees which he either po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed or claimed in Eng|land: when it is probable that the two monarchs them&s;elves and their mini&s;ters, would at that very time have differed in the li&s;t: The Scotti&s;h King might po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome to which his right was di&s;puted; he might claim others, which he did not po&s;&s;e&s;s: And neither of the kings was willing to re&s;ign his preten&s;ions by a particular enumeration.</P>
<P>A late author of great indu&s;try and learning, but full of prejudices, and of no penetration, Mr. Carte, has taken advantage of the undefined terms of the Scots homage, and has pretended that it was done for Lothian and Galloway, that is, all the territories of the country now called Scotland, lying &s;outh of the Clyde and Forth. But to refute this preten&s;ion at once, we need only con&s;ider, that if the&s;e territories were held in &s;ee of the Engli&s;h Kings, there would, by the nature of the feudal law us e&s;tabli&s;hed in England, have been continual appeals from them to the courts of the lord Paramont; contrary to all the hi&s;tories and records of that age. We find, that, as &s;oon as Edward really e&s;tabli&s;h|ed his &s;uperiority, appeals immediately commenced from all parts of Scotland: And that King, in his writ to the king's bench, confiders them as a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the feudal tenure. Such large territories al&s;o would have &s;upplied a confiderable part of the Engli&s;h armies, which never could have e&s;caped all the hi&s;torians. Not to mention that there is not any in&s;tance of a Scots pri&s;oner of war being tried as a rebel, in the many ho&s;tilities between the kingdoms, where the Scots armies were chiefly filed from the &s;outhern counties.</P>

Carte's notion with regard to Galloway, which comprehends, in the language of that age, or rather in that of the preceding, mo&s;t of the &s;outh we&s;t counties of Scotland; his notion, I &s;ay, re&s;ts on &s;o &s;light a foundation, that it &s;carce merits being refuted. He will have it (and merely becau&s;e he will have it) that the Cumberland, yielded by King Edmund to Malcolm I. meant not only the coun|ty in England of that name, but all the territory northwards to the Clyde. But the ca&s;e of Lothian de&s;erves &s;ome more con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>IT is certain, that in very antient language, Scotland means only the country north of the firths of Clyde and Forth. I &s;hall not make a parade of literature to prove it; becau&s;e I do not find that this point is di&s;puted by the Scots them&s;elves. The &s;outhern country was divided into Galloway and Lo|thian; and the latter comprehended all the &s;outh ea&s;t counties. This territory was certainly a part of the antient kingdom of Northumberland, and was entirely peopled by Saxons, who afterwards receiv|ed a great mixture of Danes among them. It appears from all the Engli&s;h hi&s;tories, that the whole kingdom of Northumberland paid very little obedience to the Saxon monarchs, who governed after the di&s;&s;olution of the heptarchy; and the northern and remote parts of it &s;eem to have fallen into a kind of anarchy, &s;ometimes pillaged by the Danes, and &s;ometimes concurring with them in their ra|vages upon other parts of England. The kings of Scotland, lying nearer them, took at la&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country, which had &s;carce any government, and we are told by Matthew of We&s;tmin&s;ter, p. 193. that King Edgar made a grant of the territory to Kenneth III. that is, he re&s;igned claims, which he could not make effectual, without be&s;towing on them more trouble and expence than they were worth: For the&s;e are the only grants of provinces made by kings; and &s;o ambitious and active a prince as Edgar would never have given pre&s;ents of any other kind. Tho' Matthew of We&s;tmin&s;ter's autho|rity may appear &s;mall with regard to &s;o remote a tran&s;action; yet we may admit it in this ca&s;e, be|cau&s;e Ordericus Vitalis, a very good authority, tells us, p. 701. that Malcolm acknowledged to Wil|liam Rufus, that the conqueror had confirmed to him the former grant of Lothian. But it follows not, becau&s;e Edgar made this &s;pecies of grant to Kenneth, that therefore he exacted homage for that terri|tory. Homage and the whole rites of the feudal law were very little known to the Saxons; and we may al&s;o &s;uppo&s;e, that the claim of Edgar was &s;o antiquated and weak, that in re&s;igning it, he made no very valuable conce&s;&s;ion, and Kenneth might well refu&s;e to hold by &s;o precarious a tenure a terri|tory, which he at pre&s;ent held by the &s;word. In &s;hort, no author &s;ays, he did homage for it.</P>
<P>THE only colour indeed of authority for Mr. Carte's notion is, that Matthew Paris, who wrote in the reign of Henry III. before Edward's claim of &s;uperiority was heard of, &s;ays that Alexander III. did homage to Henry III. <HI>pro Laudiano et aliis terris.</HI> See page 555. This word &s;eems naturally to be interpreted Lothian. But in the fir&s;t place, Matthew Paris's te&s;timony, tho' con&s;iderable, will not outweigh that of all the other hi&s;torians, who &s;ay that the Scots homage was always done for lands in England. Secondly, if the Scots homage was done in general terms (as has been already proved) it is no wonder that hi&s;torians &s;hould differ in their account of the object of it, &s;ince the parties them|&s;elves were not fully agreed. Thirdly, there is rea&s;on to think that <HI>Laudianum</HI> in Matthew Paris does not mean Lothian in Scotland. There appears to have been a territory, which antiently bore that or a &s;imilar name, in the north of England. For (1) The Saxon Chronicle, p. 197. &s;ays that Malcolm Kenmure met William Rufus in Lodene in England. (2) It is agreed by all the hi&s;torians, that Hen|ry II. only reconquered from Scotland the northern counties of Northumberland, Cumberland, and We&s;tmorland. See Newbriggs, p. 383. Wykes, p. 30. Hemingford, p. 492. Yet the &s;ame coun|try is called by other hi&s;torians Loidis, comitatus Lodonen&s;is, or &s;ome &s;uch name. See M. Paris, p. 68. M. We&s;t. p. 247. Annal. Waverl. p. 159. and Diceto, p. 531. (3) This la&s;t mentioned author, when he &s;peaks of Lothian in Scotland, calls it Loheneis, p. 574. tho' he had called the Engli&s;h ter|ritory Lo dis. (4) King David's charter to the church of Durham, begins with this pa&s;&s;age. <HI>Omni|bus Scotis &amp; Anglis, tam in Scotia, quam in Ledoneis con&s;titutes,</HI> &amp;c. See Spellman Glo&s;s. in verbo Sco|tia. Whence we may learn, that the province of <HI>Ledoneium</HI> was not only &s;ituated &s;outh of the Tweed, but al&s;o extended beyond Durham, and made a part of England.</P>
<P>I thought this long note requi&s;ite in order to correct Mr. Carte's mi&s;take, an author who&s;e dili|gence and indu&s;try has given light to many pa&s;&s;ages of the more antient Engli&s;h hi&s;tory.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>WHEN the Scotti&s;h barons a&s;&s;embled in this place, tho' moved with indignation at the inju&s;tice of this unexpected claim, and at the fraud with which it had been conducted, they found them&s;elves betrayed into a &s;ituation, in which it was im|po&s;&s;ible for them to make any defence for the ancient liberty and independance of their country. The King of England, a martial and politic prince, at the head of a powerful army, lay at a very &s;mall di&s;tance, and was only &s;eparated from them by a river fordable in many places.

THE King, having finally made, as he imagined, this important acqui&s;ition, left the commi&s;&s;ioners to &s;it at Berwick, and examine the titles of the &s;everal candidates, who claimed the precarious crown, which Edward was willing for &s;ome time to allow the lawful heir to enjoy. He went &s;outhwards, both in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the funerals of his mother, Queen Eleanor, who died about this time, and to compo&s;e &s;ome differences which had ari&s;en among his principal nobility. Gilbert earl of Gloce&s;ter, the greate&s;t baron of the kingdom, had e&s;pou&s;ed the King's daughter; and being elated by that alliance, and &s;till more by his own exorbitant power, which, he thought, &s;et him above the laws, he permitted his bailiffs and va&s;&s;als to commit violences on the lands of Humphrey Bohun earl of Hereford, who retaliated the injury by like violences. But this was not a reign in which &s;uch illegal proceedings could pa&s;s with impunity. Edward pro|cured a &s;entence again&s;t the two earls, committed them both to pri&s;on, and would not re&s;tore them to their liberty, till he exacted a fine of 1000 merks from Here|ford, and one of 10,000 from his &s;on-in-law.</P>

Accordingly Baliol, tho' a prince of a &s;oft and gentle &s;pirit, returned into Scotland highly provoked at this u&s;age, and determined at all hazards to vindicate his liberty; and the war, which &s;oon after broke out between France and England, gave him a favourable opportunity for executing his purpo&s;e.</P>

Tho' no|thing could be wor&s;e calculated for cultivating the arts of peace or maintaining peace it&s;elf, than the long &s;ubordination of va&s;&s;alage from the King to the mean|e&s;t gentleman, and the con&s;equent &s;lavery of the lower people, evils in&s;eparable from the feudal &s;y&s;tem; that &s;y&s;tem was never able to fix the &s;tate in a proper warlike po&s;ture, or give it the full exertion of its power for defence, and &s;till le&s;s for offence, again&s;t a public enemy. The military tenants, unacquainted with obedience, unexperienced in war, held a rank in the troops by their birth, not by their merits or &s;ervices; compo&s;ed a very di&s;orderly and con&s;equently a very feeble army; and during the few days, which they were obliged by their tenures to remain in the field, were often more formidable to their own prince than to foreign powers, again&s;t whom they were a&s;&s;embled. The &s;overeigns came gradually to di&s;u&s;e this cumber&s;ome and dangerous machine, &s;o apt to re|coil upon the hand which held it; and exchanging the military &s;ervice for pe|cuniary &s;upplies, inli&s;ted forces by means of a contract with particular officers, (&s;uch as tho&s;e the Italians denominate <HI>Condottieri</HI>) whom they di&s;mi&s;&s;ed at the end of the war.

Mean-while, the old Gothic fabric, being neglected, went gradually to decay; and tho' the conqueror had divided all the lands of England into &s;ixty thou&s;and knight's fees, the number of the&s;e was in&s;en&s;ibly dimini&s;hed by various artifices; and the king at la&s;t found, that, by putting the law in execution, he could a&s;|&s;emble only a very &s;mall part of the antient force of the kingdom. It was an u&s;ual expedient for men, who held of the King or a great baron by military te|nure, to transfer their lands to the church, and receive them back by another te|nure called frankalmoigne, by which they were not bound to perform any &s;er|vice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Madox's Baronia Anglica, p. 114.</NOTE>.

<P>THE exorbitant e&s;tates, conferred by the Norman, on his barons and chief|tains, remained not long entire and unimpaired. The landed property was gra|dualy &s;hared out into more hands; and tho&s;e immen&s;e baronies were divided, ei|ther by provi&s;ions to younger children, by partitions among co heirs, by &s;ale, or by e&s;cheating to the King, who gratified a great number of his courtiers, by dealing them out among them in &s;maller portions. Such moderate e&s;tates, as they required oeconomy, and confined the proprietors to their own hou&s;es, were better calculated for duration; and the order of knights and &s;mall barons grew daily more numerous, and began to form a very re&s;pectable rank or order in the &s;tate. As they were all of them immediate va&s;&s;als of the crown by military te|nure, they were, from the principles of the feudal law, equally intitled with the greate&s;t barons, to a &s;eat in the national or general councils; and this right, tho' regarded as a privilege, which the owners would not entirely relinqui&s;h, was al&s;o con&s;idered as a burthen, which they de&s;ired to be &s;ubjected to only on extraordi|nary occa&s;ions. Hence it was provided in the charter of King John, that, while the great barons were &s;ummoned to the general council by a particular writ, the &s;mall barons, under which appellation the knights were al&s;o comprehended, &s;hould only be called by a general &s;ummons of the &s;heriff. The di&s;tinction be|tween great and &s;mall barons, like that between rich and poor, was not exactly defined; but, agreeable to the inaccurate genius of that age and to the &s;implici|ty of antient government, was left very much to be determined by the di&s;cretion of the King and his mini&s;ters. It was u&s;ual for the prince to require, by a par|ticular &s;ummons, the attendance of a baron in one parliament, and to neglect him in future parliaments<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chancellor We&s;t. enquiry into the manner of creating peers, p. 43, 46, 47, 55.</NOTE>; nor was this uncertainty ever complained of as an injury. He attended when required: He was better plea&s;ed on other occa&s;ions to be exempted from the burthen: And as he was acknowledged to be of the
<PB N="87" REF="93">
&s;ame order with the greate&s;t barons, it gave them no &s;urprize to &s;ee him take his &s;eat in the great councils, whether he appeared of his own accord, or by a particular &s;ummons from the King. The barons from <HI>Writ,</HI> therefore, be|gan gradually to intermix them&s;elves with the antient barons from <HI>Tenure;</HI> and as Cambden tells us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Britann. p. 122.</NOTE>, from an antient manu&s;cript, now lo&s;t, that after the bat|tle of Eve&s;ham, a po&s;itive law was enacted, prohibiting every baron to appear in parliament, who was not invited thither by a particular &s;ummons, the whole baronage of England held thenceforward their &s;eat by writ, and this important privilege of their tenures was in effect aboli&s;hed. Only where writs had been re|gularly continued for &s;ome time in one great family, the omi&s;&s;ion of them would have been regarded as an affront, and even as an injury.</P>
<P>A like alteration gradually took place in the order of earls, who were the high|e&s;t rank of barons. The dignity of an earl, like that of a baron, was antiently territorial and official<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Spellm. Glo&s;&s;. in voce, <HI>Comis.</HI></NOTE>: He exerci&s;ed juri&s;diction within his county: He levied the third of the fines to his own profit: He was at once a civil and a military magi&s;trate: And tho' his authority, from the fir&s;t conque&s;t of the Normans, was hereditary in England, the title was &s;o much connected with the office, that where the King intended to create a new earl, he had no other expedient than to erect a certain territory into a county or earldom, and to be&s;tow it upon the per|&s;on and his family<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ays on Briti&s;h Antiquities. This practice, however, &s;eems to have been more familiar in Scot|land and the kingdoms on the continent, than in England.</NOTE>. But as the &s;heriffs, who were the vice-gerents of the earls, were named by the King, and removeable at plea&s;ure, he found
them more de|pendant upon him; and endeavoured to throw the whole authority and juri&s;dic|tion of the office into their hands. This magi&s;trate was at the head of the fi|nances, and levied all the King's rents within his county: He a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at plea&s;ure the talliages on the inhabitants in royal deme&s;ne: He had u&s;ually committed to him the management of wards and often of e&s;cheats: He pre&s;ided in the lower courts of judicature: And thus, tho' inferior to the earl in dignity, he was &s;oon con&s;idered, by this union of the judicial and fi&s;cal powers, and by the confidence repo&s;ed in him by the King, as much &s;uperior to him in authority, and under|mined his influence within his own juri&s;diction<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">There are in&s;tances of princes of the blood who accepted of the office of &s;heriff. Spellman in voce <HI>Vicecomis.</HI></NOTE>. It became u&s;ual, in creating an earl, to give him a fixt &s;allary, commonly about twenty pounds a year, in lieu of his third of the fines: The diminution of his power kept pace with the
re|trenchment of his profit: And the dignity of earl, in&s;tead of territorial and offi|cial,
<PB N="88" REF="94">
dwindled into per&s;onal and titular. Such were the mighty alterations, which had already fully taken place, or were gradually advancing, in the hou&s;e of peers; that is, in the parliament: For there was antiently no other hou&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the introduction of barons by writ, and of titular earls, had given &s;ome encrea&s;e to the royal authority; there were other cau&s;es, which counterbal|lanced tho&s;e innovations, and tended in a higher degree to dimini&s;h the power of the &s;overeign. The di&s;u&s;e, into which the feudal militia had in a great mea&s;ure fallen, made the barons almo&s;t entirely forget their dependence on the crown: By the diminution of knights fees, the King had no rea&s;onable compen&s;ation when he levied &s;cutages and exchanged their &s;ervices for money: The alienations of the crown lands had reduced him to poverty: And above all, the conce&s;&s;ion of the great charter had &s;et bounds to royal authority, and had rendered it more dif|ficult and dangerous for the prince to exert any extraordinary acts of arbitrary power. In this &s;ituation it was natural for the King to court the friend&s;hip of the le&s;&s;er barons and knights, who&s;e influence was nowi&s;e dangerous to him, and who, being expo&s;ed to oppre&s;&s;ion from their powerful neighbours, &s;ought a le|gal protection under the &s;hadow of the throne. He de&s;ired, therefore, to have their pre&s;ence in parliament, where they &s;erved to controul the turbulent re&s;olu|tions of the great. To exact a regular attendance of the whole body would have produced confu&s;ion, and would have impo&s;ed too heavy a burthen upon them. To &s;ummon only a few by writ, tho' it was practi&s;ed and had a good effect, &s;erved not entirely the King's purpo&s;e; becau&s;e the&s;e members had no farther authority than attended their per&s;onal character, and were eclip&s;ed by the appear|ance of the more powerful nobility. He therefore di&s;pen&s;ed with the attendance of mo&s;t of the le&s;&s;er barons in parliament; and in return for this indulgence, (for &s;uch it was then e&s;teemed) required them to choo&s;e in each county a certain num|ber of their own body, who&s;e charges they bore, and who, having gained the confidence, carried with them, of cour&s;e, the authority of the whole order. This expedient had been practi&s;ed at different times, in the reign of Henry III<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rot. Clau&s;. 38 Hen. III. m. y. and 12 d: As al&s;o Rot. Clau&s;. 42. Hen. III. m. 1. d.

<P>BUT there were other important con&s;equences, which followed the diminution and di&s;u&s;e of the antient feudal militia. The King's expences, in levying and maintaining a military force for every enterprize, was encrea&s;ed beyond what his narrow revenues were able to bear: As the &s;cutages of his military tenants, which were accepted in lieu of their per&s;onal &s;ervice, had fallen to nothing; there were no means of &s;upply but from voluntary aids granted him by the parliament and church: Or from the talliages which he might levy upon the towns and inhabi|tants in royal deme&s;ne. In the former year, Edward had been obliged to exact no le&s;s than the &s;ixth of all moveables from the laity, and the half of all eccle&s;i|a&s;tical benetices<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brady of boroughs, p. 31. from the records.

This period, which is the twenty third of his reign, &s;eems to be the real and true epoch of the hou&s;e of commons; and the fir&s;t faint dawnings of popular government in England. For the repre&s;entatives of the counties were only deputies from the &s;maller barons and le&s;&s;er nobility: And the former precedent of repre&s;entatives from the boroughs, who were &s;um|moned by the earl of Leice&s;ter, was regarded as the act of a violent u&s;urpation, had been di&s;continued in all the &s;ub&s;equent parliaments, and if that mea&s;ure had not become requi&s;ite on other accounts, this example was more likely to bla&s;t than give credit to it.</P>
<P>DURING the cour&s;e of two centuries, the kings of England, in imitation of other European princes, had embraced the &s;alutary policy of encouraging and protecting the lower and more indu&s;trious orders of the &s;tate; whom they &s;ound well di&s;po&s;ed to obey the laws and civil magi&s;trate, and who&s;e ingenuity and la|bour furni&s;hed commodities, requi&s;ite for the ornament of peace and &s;upport of war. Tho' the inhabitants of the country were &s;till left at the di&s;po&s;al of their imperious lords; many attempts were made to give more &s;ecurity and liberty to citizens, and make them enjoy unmole&s;ted the fruits of their indu&s;try.

But when the multiplied nece&s;&s;ities of the crown produced a greater demand for &s;upply, the King, who&s;e prerogative entitled him to exact it, found, that he had not power &s;ufficient to enforce his edicts, and that it was requi&s;ite, before he impo&s;ed taxes, to &s;mooth the way for his demand, and to obtain the previous con&s;ent of the boroughs, by &s;ollicitation, remon&s;trances, and authority. The inconvenience of tran&s;acting this bu&s;ine&s;s with every parti|cular borough was &s;oon felt; and Edward became &s;en&s;ible, that the mo&s;t ex|peditious way of obtaining &s;upply, was to a&s;&s;emble together the deputies of all the boroughs, to lay before them the nece&s;&s;ities of the &s;tate, to di&s;cu&s;s the mat|ter in their pre&s;ence, and to require their con&s;ent to the demands of their &s;ove|reign. For this rea&s;on, he i&s;&s;ued writs to the &s;heriffs, enjoining them to &s;end to parliament, along with two knights of the &s;hire, two deputies from each bo|rough within their county<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Writs were i&s;&s;ued to about 120 cities and boroughs.</NOTE>, and the&s;e provided with &s;ufficient powers from their community, to con&s;ent, in their name, to what he and his council &s;hould require of them. <HI>As it is a mo&s;t equitable rule,</HI> &s;ays he, in his preamble to this writ, <HI>that what concerns all &s;hould be approved of by all; and common dangers be repelled by united efforts</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Brady of boroughs, p. 25, 33, from the records.

<P>THE union, however, of the repre&s;entatives from all the boroughs gave gra|dually more weight to the whole order; and it became cu&s;tomary for them, in return for the &s;upplies, which they granted, to prefer petitions to the crown for the redre&s;s of any particular grievances, of which they found rea&s;on to com|plain.

The age did not refine &s;o much as to perceive the danger of the&s;e irregularities. No man was di&s;plea&s;ed, that the &s;overeign, at the de&s;ire of any cla&s;s of men, &s;hould i&s;&s;ue an order, which only concerned that cla&s;s; and his predece&s;&s;ors were &s;o near po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the whole legi|&s;lative power, that he gave no di&s;gu&s;t by a&s;&s;uming it in this &s;eemingly inof|fen&s;ive manner. But time and farther experience gradually opened mens eyes and corrected &s;uch abu&s;es. It was found, that no laws could be fixed for one order of men without affecting the whole; and that the force and efficacy of laws depended entirely on the terms employed in wording them. The hou&s;e of peers, therefore, the mo&s;t powerful order of the &s;tate, rea&s;onably expected, that their a&s;&s;ent &s;hould be expre&s;sly granted to all public ordinances<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the&s;e in&s;tances found in Cotton's abridgement, where the King appears to an&s;wer of him&s;elf the petitions of the commons, he probably exerted no more than that power, which was long inhe|rent in the crown, of regulating le&s;&s;er matters by his edicts or proclamations.

<P>BUT as the &s;ame cau&s;es, which produced a partition of property, continued &s;till to operate; the number of knights and le&s;&s;er barons, or what the Engli&s;h call the gentry, perpetually encrea&s;ed, and &s;unk into a rank &s;till more inferior to the great nobility. The equality of tenure was lo&s;t in the great inferiority of power and property; and the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives from the counties was gra|dually &s;eparated from that of the peers, and formed a di&s;tinct order in the &s;tate<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cotton's abridgement, p. 13.</NOTE>.

rights and privileges<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was very agreeable to the maxims of all the feudal governments, that every order of the &s;tate &s;hould give their con&s;ent to the acts which more immediately concerned them; and as the notion of a political &s;y&s;tem was not then &s;o well under&s;tood, the other orders of the &s;tate were often not con&s;ulted on the&s;e occa&s;ions. In this reign, even the merchants, tho' no public body, granted the King impo|&s;itions on merchandize, becau&s;e the fir&s;t payments came out of their pockets. They did the &s;ame in the reign of Edward III. but the commons had then ob&s;erved, that the people paid the&s;e duties, tho' the merchants advanced them; and they therefore remon&s;trated again&s;t this practice. Cotton's abridg. p. 39. The taxes impo&s;ed by the knights on the counties were always lighter than tho&s;e which the burge&s;&s;es laid on the boroughs, a pre&s;umption, that in voting the&s;e taxes the knights and burge&s;&s;es did not form the &s;ame hou&s;e. See chancellor We&s;t's enquiry into the manner of creating peers, p. 8. But there are &s;o many proofs, that the&s;e two orders of repre&s;entatives were long &s;eparate, that it is needle&s;s to in&s;i&s;t on them. Mr. Carte, who had carefully con&s;ulted the rolls of parliament, affirms, that they never appear to have been united till the 16th of Edward III. See Hi&s;t. vol. 2. p. 451. But 'tis certain that this union was not even then final: In 1372, the burge&s;&s;es acted by them&s;elves, and vot|ed a tax after the knights were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. See Tyrrel Hi&s;t. vol. 3. p. 734, from Rot. Clau&s;. 46 Edw. III. n. 9. In 1376, they were the knights alone, who pa&s;&s;ed a vote for the removal of Alice Pierce from the King's per&s;on, if we may credit Wal&s;ingham, p. 189. There is an in&s;tance of a like kind in the reign of Richard II. Cotton, p. 193. The different taxes voted by the&s;e two branches of the lower hou&s;e, kept them naturally &s;eparate: But as their petitions had mo&s;tly the &s;ame object, viz. the redre&s;s of grievances, and the &s;upport of law and ju&s;tice both again&s;t the crown and the barons, this cau&s;e as na|turally united them, and was the rea&s;on why they at la&s;t joined in one hou&s;e for the di&s;patch of bu|&s;ine&s;s. The barons had few petitions: There privileges were of more antient date: Grievances &s;el|dom affected them: They were them&s;elves the chief oppre&s;&s;ors. In 1333, the knights by them&s;elves concurred with the bi&s;hops and barons in advi&s;ing the King to &s;tay his journey into Ireland. Here was a petition which regarded a matter of &s;tate, and was &s;uppo&s;ed to be above the capacity of the burge&s;&s;es. The knights, therefore, acted a part in this petition. See Cotton. abridg. p. 13. Chief baron Gilbert thinks, that the rea&s;on why taxes began always with the commons or burge&s;&s;es was, that they were li|mited by the in&s;tructions of their boroughs. See hi&s;t. of the Exchequer, p. 37.</NOTE> Thus the third e&s;tate, that of the commons, reached at la&s;t its pre&s;ent form; and as the country gentlemen made thenceforwards no &s;cruple of appearing as deputies of the boroughs, the di&s;tinction between the members was entirely lo&s;t, and the lower hou&s;e acquired thence a great acce&s;&s;ion of weight and importance in the kingdom. Still, however, the office of this e&s;tate was very different from that which it has &s;ince exerci&s;ed with &s;o much advantage to the public. In&s;tead of checking and controuling the authority of the King, they were naturally induced to adhere to him, as the great fountain of law and ju&s;tice, and to &s;upport him again&s;t the exorbitant power of the ari&s;tocracy, which was at once the &s;ource of oppre&s;&s;ion to them&s;elves, and di&s;turbed him in the exe|cution of the laws. The King, in his turn, gave countenance to an order of men, &s;o u&s;eful and &s;o little dangerous: The peers al&s;o were obliged to pay them &s;ome con&s;ideration: And by this means, the third e&s;tate, formerly &s;o abject in England, as well as in all other European nations, ro&s;e by &s;low degrees to their pre&s;ent im|portance;
<PB N="94" REF="100">
and in their progre&s;s made arts and commerce, the nece&s;&s;ary attendants of liberty and equality, flouri&s;h in the kingdom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The chief argument from antient authority, for the opinion that the repre&s;entatives of boroughs preceded the forty-ninth of Henry III. is the famous petition of the borough of St. Albans, fir&s;t taken notice of by Selden, and then by Petyt, Brady, Tyrrel, and others. In this petition, pre&s;ented to the parliament in the reign of Edward II. the town of St. Albans a&s;&s;erts, that tho' they held <HI>in capite</HI> of the crown, and owed only, for all other &s;ervices, their attendance in parliament, yet the &s;heriff had omitted them in his writs; whereas both in the reign of the King's father, and all his predece&s;&s;ors, they had always &s;ent members. Now, &s;ay the defenders of this opinion, if the commencement of the hou&s;e of commons was in Henry III's reign, this expre&s;&s;ion could not have been u&s;ed. But Madox, in his Hi&s;tory of the Exchequer, p. 522, 523, 524, has endeavoured to de&s;troy the authority of this petition for the purpo&s;e alledged. He a&s;&s;erts, fir&s;t, that there was no &s;uch tenure in England as that of holding by attendance in parliament, in&s;tead of all other &s;ervice. Secondly, That the borough of St. Albans never held of the crown at all, but was always deme&s;ne land of the abbot. It is no wonder, therefore, that a petition which advances two fal&s;hoods, &s;hould contain one hi&s;torical mi&s;take, which indeed amounts only to an inaccurate expre&s;&s;ion. Accordingly St. Albans continued &s;till to belong to the abbot. It never held of the crown, till after the di&s;&s;olution of the mona&s;teries. But the a&s;&s;urance of the&s;e petitioners is remarkable. They wanted to &s;hake off the authority of their abbot, and to hold of the King; but were unwilling to pay any &s;ervices even to the crown: Upon which they framed this petition, which latter writers have made the foundation of &s;o many inferences and con|clu&s;ions. From the tenor of the petition it appears, that there was a clo&s;e connexion between holding of the crown, and being repre&s;ented in parliament: The latter had &s;carce ever place without the for|mer: Yet we learn from Tyrrel's Append. vol. 4. that there were &s;ome in&s;tances to the contrary. It is not improbable, that Edward followed the roll of the earl of Mountfort, who had &s;ummoned, without di&s;tinction, all the con&s;iderable boroughs of the kingdom; among whom there might be &s;ome few who did hold of the crown. Edward al&s;o found it nece&s;&s;ary to impo&s;e taxes on all the boroughs of the kingdom without di&s;tinction. This was a good expedient for augmenting his revenue.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHAT &s;ufficient y proves, that the commencement of the hou&s;e of burge&s;&s;es, who were the true commons, was not an affair of chance, but aro&s;e from the ne|ce&s;&s;ities of the pre&s;ent &s;ituation, is, that Edward, at the very &s;ame time, &s;um|moned deputies from the inferior clergy, the fir&s;t that ever met in England<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Archbp.

Formerly the eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices bore no part of the burthens of the &s;tate: The Pope had indeed of late often levied impo&s;itions upon them: He had &s;ome|times granted this power to the &s;overeign<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ann. Waverl. p. 227, 228. T.

But on this occa&s;ion he met
<PB N="95" REF="101">
with difficulties. Whether that the clergy thought them&s;elves the mo&s;t indepen|dant body of men in the kingdom, or were di&s;gu&s;ted by the former exorbitant impo&s;itions, they ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed their a&s;&s;ent to the King's demand of a fifth of their moveables; and it was not till a &s;econd meeting, that on their per&s;i&s;ting in this refu&s;al, he was willing to accept of a tenth. The barons and knights granted him, without he&s;itation, an eleventh; the burge&s;&s;es, a &s;eventh. But the clergy &s;till &s;crupled to meet on the King's writ; le&s;t by &s;uch obedience they &s;hould &s;eem to acknowledge the authority of the temporal power: And this compromi&s;e was at la&s;t fallen upon, that the King &s;hould i&s;&s;ue his writ to the arch|bi&s;hop; and that the archbi&s;hop &s;hould, in con&s;equence of it, &s;ummon the clergy, who, as they then appeared to obey their &s;piritual &s;uperior, no longer he&s;itated to meet in convocation. This expedient, however, was the cau&s;e, why the eccle&s;ia&s;tics met in two hou&s;es of convocation, under their &s;everal archbi&s;hops, and formed not one e&s;tate, like tho&s;e in other countries of Europe, as was at fir&s;t the King's intention<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gilbert's Hi&s;t. of Excheq. p. 51, 54.</NOTE>.

The primate, not di&s;mayed by the&s;e proofs of Edward's re&s;olution, here plainly told him, that the clergy owed obedience to two &s;overeigns, their &s;piritual and their temporal; but their duty bound them to a much &s;tricter attachment to the former than to the latter: They could not comply with his commands (for &s;uch, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the reque&s;ts of the crown were then deemed) in contradiction to the expre&s;s prohibition of the &s;overeign pontiff<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heming, vol. 1. p. 107.</NOTE>.</P>

The con&s;table and mare&s;chal, informed of the King's compliance, were &s;atisfied; and not only cea&s;ed from di&s;turbing the government, but a&s;&s;i&s;ted the regency with all their power again&s;t the Scots, who had ri&s;en in arms, and had thrown off the yoke of the Engli&s;h<NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. 1. p. 143</NOTE>. But being &s;en&s;ible, that the &s;malle&s;t pre|tence would &s;uffice to make Edward retract the&s;e dete&s;ted laws, which, tho' they
<PB N="104" REF="110">
had often received the &s;anction both of King and parliament, and had been ac|knowledged during three reigns, were never yet deemed to have &s;ufficient vali|d ty; they in&s;i&s;ted, that he &s;hould again confirm them on his return to England, and &s;hould thereby renounce all plea which he might derive from his re&s;iding in a foreign country, when he formerly affixed his &s;eal to them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. 1. p. 159.</NOTE>. It appeared, that they judged aright of Edward's character and intentions: He delayed this con|firmation as long as po&s;&s;ible; and when the fear of wor&s;e con&s;equences obliged him again to comply, he added expre&s;sly a &s;alvo for his royal dignity or prero|gative, which in effect enervated the force of the whole charter<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. 1. p. 167, 168.</NOTE>. The two earls and their adherents left the parliament in di&s;content; and the King was con|&s;trained, in a future &s;e&s;&s;ion, to grant the people, without any &s;ubterfuge, a pure and ab&s;olute confirmation of tho&s;e laws<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. 1. p. 168.</NOTE>, which were &s;o much the object of their pa&s;&s;ionate affection. Even farther &s;ecurities were then provided for the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of national privileges. Three knights were appointed to be cho&s;en in each county, and were inve&s;ted with the power of puni&s;hing by fines and impri&s;on|ment, every tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion or violation of the charters<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Hemingford, vol. 1. p. 170.</NOTE>: A precaution, which, tho' it was &s;oon di&s;u&s;ed, as encroaching too much on royal prerogative, proves the attachment, which the Engli&s;h in that age bore to liberty, and their well founded jealou&s;y of the arbitrary di&s;po&s;ition of Edward.</P>
<P>THE work, however, was not yet entirely fini&s;hed and compleat. In order to execute the le&s;&s;er charter, it was requi&s;ite by new perambulations to &s;et bounds to the royal fore&s;ts, and to de&s;affore&s;t all tho&s;e lands which former encroach|ments had comprehended within their limits. Edward di&s;covered the &s;ame re|luctance to comply with this equitable demand; and it was not till after many delays on his part, and many &s;ollicitations and reque&s;ts, and even menaces of war and violence<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 80. We are told by Tyrrel, vol. 2. p. 145. from the Chronicle of St. Albans, that the barons, not contented with the execution of the charter of fore&s;ts, demanded of Edward as high terms as had been impo&s;ed on his father by the earl of Leice&s;ter: But no other hi&s;torian mentions this particular.</NOTE>, on the part of the barons, that the perambulations were made, and exact boundaries fixt, by a jury in each county, to the extent of his fore&s;ts<NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. 1. p. 171. M. We&s;t. p. 431, 433.</NOTE>. Had not his ambitious and active temper rai&s;ed him &s;o many foreign enemies, and obliged him to have recour&s;e &s;o often to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his &s;ub|jects, it is likely that the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions could never have been extorted from him.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="111">
BUT while the people, after &s;o many &s;ucce&s;sful &s;trugles, deemed them&s;elves happy in the &s;ecure po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their privileges; they were &s;urprized in 1305 to find, that Edward had &s;ecretly applied to Rome, and had procured from that mercenary court, an ab&s;olution from all the oaths and engagements, which he had &s;o often reiterated to ob&s;erve both the charters. There are &s;ome hi&s;torians <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brady, vol. 2. p. 84. Carte, vol. 2. p. 292.</NOTE> &s;o credulous as to imagine, that this perilous &s;tep was taken by him for no other purpo&s;e than to acquire the merit of granting a new confirmation of the charters, as he did &s;oon after; and a confirmation &s;o much the more unque&s;tionable, that it could never after be invalidated by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors from the pretence of any force or violence which had been impo&s;ed on him. But be&s;ides, that this might have been done with a much better grace, if he had never applied for any &s;uch ab&s;olu|tion, the whole tenor of his conduct proves him to be little &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;uch re|finements in patrioti&s;m; and this very deed it&s;elf, in which he confirmed anew the charters, carries in the face of it a very oppo&s;ite pre&s;umption. Tho' he ratified the charters in general, he &s;till laid hold of the papal bull &s;o far as to invalidate the late perambulations of the fore&s;ts, which had been made with &s;uch care and attention, and to re&s;erve to him&s;elf the power, in ca&s;e of favourable incidents, to extend as much as formerly the&s;e arbitrary juri&s;dictions. If the power was not in fact made u&s;e of, we can only conclude, that the favourable incidents did not occur.</P>
<P>THUS, after the conte&s;ts of near a whole century, and tho&s;e ever accompanied with violent jealou&s;ies, often with public convul&s;ions, the great charter was finally e&s;ta|bli&s;hed; and the Engli&s;h nation have the honour of extorting, by their per&s;eve|rance, this conce&s;&s;ion from the able&s;t, the mo&s;t warlike, and the mo&s;t ambitious of all their princes<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It mu&s;t however be remarked, that the King never forgave the chief actors in this tran&s;action, and he found means afterwards to oblige both the con&s;table and mare&s;chal to re&s;ign their offices into his hands. The former received a new grant of it: But the office of mare&s;chal was given to Thomas of Brotherton, the King's &s;econd &s;on.</NOTE>. It is computed, that above thirty confirmations of it were at different times required of &s;everal Kings, and granted by them, in full parlia|ment; a precaution, which, while it di&s;covers &s;ome ignorance of the true na|ture of law and government, proves a very laudable jealou&s;y of national privi|leges in the people, and an extreme anxiety, le&s;t contrary precedents &s;hould ever be pleaded as an authority for infringing them. Accordingly we find, that, tho' arbitrary practices often prevailed, and were even able to e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves in|to &s;ettled cu&s;toms, the validity of the great charter was never afterwards formal|ly di&s;puted; and that grant was &s;till regarded as the ba&s;is of the Engli&s;h govern|ment, and the &s;ure rule by which the authority of every cu&s;tom was to be tried and canva&s;&s;ed. The juri&s;diction of the Star-chamber, martial law, impri&s;on|ment
<PB N="106" REF="112">
by warrants from the privy council, and other practices of a like nature, tho' e&s;tabli&s;hed for &s;everal centuries, were &s;carce ever allowed by the Engli&s;h to be parts of their con&s;titution: The affection of the nation for liberty &s;till prevail|ed over all precedent, and even all political rea&s;oning: The exerci&s;e of the&s;e powers, after being long the &s;ource of &s;ecret murmurs among the people, was, in fullne&s;s of time, &s;olemnly aboli&s;hed, as illegal, at lea&s;t as oppre&s;&s;ive, by the whole legi&s;lative authority.</P>
<P>To return to the period, from which this account of the charters has led us: Tho' the King's impatience to appear at the head of his armies in Flanders made him overlook all con&s;iderations, either of dome&s;tic di&s;contents or of commotions among the Scots; he had been &s;o long retarded by the &s;everal ob&s;tructions thrown in his way, that he lo&s;t the proper &s;ea&s;on for action, and after his arrival made no progre&s;s again&s;t the enemy. The King of France, takiing advantage of his ab&s;ence, had broke into the Low Countries: had defeated the Flemings in the battle of Furnes; had made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Li&s;le, St. Omer, Courtrai, and Ypres; and &s;eemed in a &s;ituation to take full vengeance on the earl of Flanders, his rebellious va&s;&s;al. But Edward, &s;econded by an Engli&s;h army of 50,000 men (for this is the number a&s;&s;igned by hi&s;torians<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. 1. p. 146.</NOTE>) was &s;oon able to &s;top the career or his victories; and Philip, finding all the weak re&s;ources of his kingdom to be already exhau&s;ted, began to dread a rever&s;e of fortune, and to apprehend an in|va&s;ion on France it&s;elf. The King of England, on the other hand, di&s;appoint|ed of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Adolph, King of the Romans, which he had purcha&s;ed at a very high price, and finding many urgent calls for his pre&s;ence in England, was de&s;irous of ending on any honourable terms a war, which &s;erved only to divert his force from the execution of more important projects. This di&s;po&s;iti|on of both monarchs &s;oon produced a ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities for two years; and engaged them to &s;ubmit their differences to the arbitration of Pope Boniface.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="year"> BONIFACE was the la&s;t of the &s;overeign pontiffs who exerci&s;ed an authority over the temporal juri&s;diction of princes; and the&s;e exorbitant preten&s;ions, which he had been tempted to a&s;&s;ume from the &s;ucce&s;sful example of his predece&s;&s;ors, but of which the &s;ea&s;on was now pa&s;t, involved him in &s;o many calamities, and were attended with &s;o unfortunate a cata&s;trophe, that they have been &s;ecretly abandoned, tho' never openly relinqui&s;hed, by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in the apo&s;tolic chair. Edward and Philip, equally jealous of papal claims, took care to in&s;ert in their reference, that Boniface was made judge of the differences by their con&s;ent, as a

private per&s;on, not by any right of his pontificate; and the Pope, without &s;eem|ing to be offended at this mortifying clau&s;e, proceeded to give a &s;entence between them, in which they both acquie&s;ced<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 2. p. 817. Heming. vol. 1. p. 149. Trivet, p. 310.</NOTE>. He brought them to agree, that their union &s;hould be cemented by a double marriage; that of Edward him&s;elf, who was now a widower, with Margaret, Philip's &s;i&s;ter, and that of the prince of Wales with I&s;abella, the daughter of that monarch<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 2. p. 823.</NOTE>. Philip was likewi&s;e will|ing to re&s;tore Guienne to the Engli&s;h, which he had indeed no preten&s;ions to detain; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace with France.</NOTE> but he in&s;i&s;ted, that the Scots and their King, John Baliol, &s;hould, as his allies, be al&s;o comprehended in the treaty, and &s;hould be re&s;tored to their liberty. The difference was, after &s;everal di&s;putes, compromi&s;ed by making mutual &s;acrifices to each other. Edward agreed to abandon his ally the earl of Flanders, on con|dition that Philip &s;hould treat in like manner his ally the King of Scots. The pro&s;pect of conquering the&s;e two countries, who&s;e &s;ituation made them &s;o com|modious an acqui&s;ition to the different kingdoms, prevailed over all other con&s;i|derations; and tho' they were both finally di&s;appointed in their hopes, their con|duct was very reconcilable to the principles of an intere&s;ted policy. This was the fir&s;t &s;pecimen which the Scots had of the French alliance, and which was ex|actly conformable to what a &s;maller power mu&s;t always expect, when it blind|ly attaches it&s;elf to the will and fortunes of a greater. That unhappy people, now engaged in a brave, tho' unequal conte&s;t for their liberties, were totally abandoned by the ally, in whom they repo&s;ed their final confidence, to the will of an imperious conqueror.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Revolt of Scotland.</NOTE> THO' England, as well as other European countries, was, in its antient &s;tate, very ill qualified for making, and &s;till wor&s;e for maintaining conque&s;ts, Scot|land was &s;o much inferior in its internal force, and was &s;o ill &s;ituated for receiving foreign &s;uccours, that it is no wonder an ambitious monarch &s;hould have ca&s;t his eye on &s;o tempting an acqui&s;ition, which brought both &s;ecurity and greatne&s;s to his native kingdom. But the in&s;truments whom Edward employed to maintain his dominion over the northern kingdom, were not happily cho&s;en; and acted not with the requi&s;ite prudence and moderation, in reconciling the Scotti&s;h nation to a yoke, which they bore with &s;uch extreme reluctance. Warrenne retiring into England, on account of his bad &s;tate of health, left the admini&s;tration entirely in the hands of Orme&s;by, who was appointed ju&s;ticiary of Scotland, and Cre&s;|&s;ingham, who bore the office of trea&s;urer; and a very &s;mall military force remain|ed to &s;ecure the precarious authority of the&s;e mini&s;ters.

object but the ama&s;&s;ing money by rapine and inju&s;tice: The former di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by the rigor and &s;everity of his temper: And both of them, treating the Scots as a conquered people, made them &s;en&s;ible, too early, of the grievous &s;er|vitude, into which they had fallen. As Edward required, that all the pro|prietors of land &s;hould &s;wear fealty to him; every one, who refu&s;ed or de|layed the giving this te&s;timony of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, was outlawed, and confined, and puni&s;hed without mercy; and the brave&s;t and mo&s;t generous &s;pirits of the nation were thus exa&s;perated to the highe&s;t degree again&s;t the Engli&s;h govern|ment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 70.

<P>THERE was one William Wallace, of a &s;mall fortune, but de&s;cended of an an|tient family, in the we&s;t of Scotland, who&s;e courage prompted him to undertake, and enabled him finally to execute, the de&s;perate attempt of delivering his na|tive country from the dominion of foreigners. This man, who&s;e valorous ex|ploits are the object of ju&s;t admiration, but have been much exaggerated by the traditions of his countrymen, had been provoked by the in&s;olence of an Engli&s;h officer to put him to death; and finding him&s;elf obnoxious on that account to the &s;everity of the admini&s;tration, he fled into the woods, and offered him&s;elf as a leader to all tho&s;e whom their crimes or bad fortune, or avowed hatred of the Engli&s;h, had reduced to a like nece&s;&s;ity. He was endowed with a gigantic force of body, with heroic courage of mind, with di&s;intere&s;ted magnanimity, with an incredible patience and ability to bear hunger, fatigue, and all the &s;everities of the &s;ea&s;ons; and he &s;oon acquired among tho&s;e de&s;perate fugitives that authority to which his virtues &s;o ju&s;tly intitled him. Beginning with &s;mall attempts, in which he was always &s;ucce&s;sful, he gradually proceeded to more momentuous enterprizes; and he di&s;covered equal caution in &s;ecuring his followers, and valour in annoying the enemy. By his knowledge of the country, he was enabled, when pur&s;ued, to en&s;ure a retreat among the mora&s;&s;es or fore&s;ts or mountains; and again, collecting his di&s;per&s;ed a&s;&s;ociates, appeared unexpectedly in another quarter, and &s;urprized and routed and put to the &s;word the unwary Engli&s;h. Every day brought accounts of his great actions, which were received with no le&s;s favour by his countrymen than terror by the enemy: All tho&s;e, who thir&s;ted after military fame, were de&s;irous to partake of his renown: His &s;ucce&s;sful va|lour &s;eemed to vindicate the nation from the ignominy into which it had fallen, by its tame &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Engli&s;h: And tho' no nobleman of note ventured as yet to join his party, he had gained a general confidence and attachment, which birth and fortune are not alone able to confer.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="115">
WALLACE, having by many fortunate enterprizes, brought the valour of his followers to corre&s;pond to his own, re&s;olved to &s;trike a deci&s;ive blow again&s;t the Engli&s;h government; and he concerted the plan of attacking Orme&s;by at Scone, and of taking vengeance on him, for all the violence and tyranny of which he had been guilty. The ju&s;ticiary apprized of his intention, fled ha&s;tily into England: All the other officers of that nation imitated his example: Their terror added alacrity and courage to the Scots; who betook them&s;elves to arms in every quar|ter: Many of the principal barons, and among the re&s;t &s;ir William Douglas<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;in. p. 70. Heming, vol. 1. p. 118.</NOTE>, openly countenanced Wallace's party: Robert Bruce &s;ecretly favoured and pro|moted the &s;ame cau&s;e: And the Scots, &s;haking off their fetters, prepared them|&s;elves to defend, by an united effort, that liberty which they had &s;o unexpected|ly recovered from the hands of their oppre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>BUT Warrenne, collecting an army of 40,000 men in the north of England, prepared to re-e&s;tabli&s;h his authority; and he endeavoured by the celerity of his armament, and of his march, to compen&s;ate for his pa&s;t negligence, which had enabled the Scots to &s;hake off the Engli&s;h government. He &s;uddenly entered Annandale, and came up with the enemy at Irvine, before their forces were fully collected, and before they had put them&s;elves in a proper po&s;ture of defence. Many of the Scots nobles, alarmed with their dangerous &s;ituation, here &s;ubmitted to the Engli&s;h, renewed their oaths of fealty, promi&s;ed to deliver ho&s;tages for their good behaviour, and received a pardon for all pa&s;t offences<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heming, vol. 1. p. 121, 122.</NOTE>. Others who had not yet declared them&s;elves, &s;uch as the &s;teward of Scotland and the earl of Lennox, joined, tho' with reluctance, the Engli&s;h army; and waited a favour|able opportunity of embracing the cau&s;e of their di&s;tre&s;&s;ed countrymen. But Wallace, who&s;e authority over his retainers was more fully confirmed by the ab|&s;ence of the great nobles, per&s;evered ob&s;tinately in his purpo&s;e; and finding him|&s;elf unable to give battle to the enemy, he marched northwards, with an intention of prolonging the war, and of turning to his advantage the &s;ituation of that moun|tainous and barren country. When Warrenne advanced to Stirling, he found Wal|lace encamped at Cambu&s;kenneth, on the oppo&s;ite banks of the Forth; and be|ing continually urged by the impatient Cre&s;&s;ingham, who was actuated both by per&s;onal and national animo&s;ities again&s;t the Scots<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hem|ing, vol. 1. p. 127.</NOTE>, he prepared to attack them in that po&s;ition, which Wallace, no le&s;s prudent than courageous, had cho&s;en for his army<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">On the 11th of September 1297.</NOTE>. In &s;pite of the remon&s;trances of Sir Richard Lundy, a Scot&s;man of birth and family, who &s;incerely adhered to the Engli&s;h, he ordered his army to pa&s;s a bridge which lay over the Forth; but he was &s;oon convinced, by fatal
<PB N="110" REF="116">
experience, of the error of his conduct. Wallace, allowing &s;uch numbers of the Engli&s;h to pa&s;s as he thought proper, attacked them before they were fully formed, put them to rout, pu&s;hed part of them into the river, where they were drowned, de&s;troyed the re&s;t by the edge of the &s;word, and obtained a complete victory over them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;in. p. 73. Heming. vol. 1. p. 127, 128, 129. Trivet, p. 307.</NOTE>. Among the &s;lain was Cre&s;&s;ingham him&s;elf, who&s;e memory was &s;o ex|tremely odious to the Scots, that they flea'd his dead body, and made &s;addles and girths of his &s;kin<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. 1. p. 130.</NOTE>. Warrenne, finding the remainder of his army extremely di&s;mayed by this misfortune, was obliged again to evacuate the kingdom, and re|tire into England. The ca&s;tles of Roxborough and Berwick, ill fortified and feebly defended, fell &s;oon after into the hands of the Scots.</P>
<P>WALLACE, univer&s;ally revered as the deliverer of his country, now received from the hands of his followers, the dignity of regent or guardian under the cap|tive Baliol; and finding, that the di&s;orders of war, as well as the unfavourable &s;ea&s;ons, had produced a famine in Scotland, he urged his army to march into England, to &s;ub&s;i&s;t at the expence of the enemy, and to revenge all pa&s;t injuries, by committing retaliations on that ho&s;tile nation. The Scots, who deemed every thing po&s;&s;ible under &s;uch a leader, joyfully attended his call; and Wallace, break|ing into the northern counties during the winter &s;ea&s;on, laid every place wa&s;te with fire and &s;word; and after extending on all &s;ides, without oppo&s;ition, the fury of his ravages, as far as the bi&s;hopric of Durham, he returned loaded with &s;poils, and crowned with glory, into his own country<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. 1. p. 131, 132, 133.</NOTE>. The di&s;orders, which at that time prevailed in England, from the refractory behaviour of the con&s;table and mare&s;chal, made it impo&s;&s;ible to collect an army &s;ufficient to re&s;i&s;t the enemy, and ex|po&s;ed the nation to this lo&s;s and di&s;honour.</P>
<P>BUT Edward, who received in Flanders intelligence of the&s;e events, and had already concluded a truce with France, now ha&s;tened over into England, in certain hopes, by his activity and valour, not only of wiping off this di&s;grace, but of recovering that important conque&s;t of Scotland, which he always regarded as the chief glory and advantage of his reign. He appea&s;ed the murmurs of his people by conce&s;&s;ions and promi&s;es: He re&s;tored to the citizens of London the election of their own magi&s;trates, of which they had been bereaved in the latter part of his father's reign. He ordered &s;trict enquiry to be made concerning the quan|tities of corn and other goods, which had been violently &s;eized before his departure, as if he intended to pay the value to the owners<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 2. p. 813.</NOTE>: And making public profe&s;|&s;ions of confirming and ob&s;erving the charters, he regained the confidence of the

<P>NOTHING could have enabled the Scots to re&s;i&s;t, but for one &s;ea&s;on, &s;o mighty a power, except an entire union among them&s;elves; but as they were deprived of their King, who&s;e per&s;onal qualities, even when he was pre&s;ent, appeared &s;o con|temptible, and had left among his &s;ubjects no principle of attachment to him or his family; factions, jealou&s;ies, and animo&s;ities, unavoidably aro&s;e among the great, and di&s;tracted all their councils. The elevation of Wallace, tho' purcha&s;ed by &s;o great merit, and &s;uch eminent &s;ervices, was the object of envy to the no|bility, who repined to &s;ee a private gentleman rai&s;ed above them by his rank, and &s;till more, by his glory and reputation. Wallace him&s;elf, &s;en&s;ible of their jealou&s;y, and dreading the ruin of his country from tho&s;e inte&s;tine di&s;cords, voluntarily re|&s;igned his authority, and retained only the command over that body of his fol|lowers, who, being accu&s;tomed to victory under his &s;tandard, refu&s;ed to follow into the field any other leader. The chief power devolved on the &s;teward of Scotland, and Cummin of Badenoch; men of eminent birth, under whom the great chieftans were more willing to &s;erve in defence of their country. The two Scotti&s;h commanders, collecting their &s;everal forces from every quarter, fixed their &s;tation at Falkirk, and propo&s;ed there to abide the a&s;&s;ault of the Engli&s;h. Wallace was at the head of a third body, which acted under his command. The Scots army placed the pikemen along their front: Interlined the intervals be|tween the three bodies with archers: And dreading the great &s;uperiority of the Engli&s;h in cavalry, endeavoured to &s;ecure their front by pali&s;adoes, tied together with ropes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 75.

<P>IN this general rout of the army, Wallace's military &s;kill and pre&s;ence of mind enabled him to keep his troops together; and retiring behind the Car|ron, which lay in his rear, he marched lei&s;urely along the banks of that &s;mall ri|ver, which protected him from the enemy. Young Bruce, who had already given many proofs of his a&s;piring genius, but who &s;erved hitherto in the Engli&s;h army, appeared on the oppo&s;ite banks; and di&s;tingui&s;hing the Scotti&s;h chieftain, as well by his maje&s;tic port, as by the intrepid activity of his behaviour, called out to him, and de&s;ired a &s;hort conference. He here repre&s;ented to Wallace the fruitle&s;s and ruinous enterprize in which he was engaged; and endeavoured to per&s;wade him to bend at la&s;t his inflexible &s;pirit to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion under &s;uperior pow|er and &s;uperior fortune: He in&s;i&s;ted on the unequal conte&s;t between a weak &s;tate, deprived of its head and agitated by inte&s;tine di&s;cord, and a mighty nation, con|ducted by the able&s;t and mo&s;t martial monarch of the age, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every re&s;ource either for drawing out the war, or for pu&s;hing it with vigor and acti|vity: If the love of his country was his motive for per&s;everance, his ob&s;tinacy tended only to prolong her mi&s;ery; if he carried his views to private grandeur and ambition, he might reflect, that, even if Edward &s;hould withdraw his armies, it appeared from pa&s;t experience, that &s;o many haughty nobles, proud of the pre|eminence of their families, would never &s;ubmit to per&s;onal merit, who&s;e &s;uperi|ority they were le&s;s inclined to regard as an object of admiration, than as a re|proach and injury to them&s;elves. To the&s;e exhortations Wallace replied, that if he had hitherto acted alone, as the champion of his native country, it was &s;olely becau&s;e no &s;econd or competitor, or what he rather wi&s;hed, no leader had as yet appeared to place him&s;elf in that honourable &s;tation: That the blame lay entirely on the nobility, and chiefly on Bruce him&s;elf, who uniting per&s;onal me|rit to d gnity of family, had de&s;erted the po&s;t, which both nature and fortune, by &s;uch powerful calls, invited him to a&s;&s;ume: That the Scots, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch a head, would, by their unanimity and concord, have &s;urmounted the chief dif|ficulty under which they now laboured, and might hope, notwith&s;tanding their pre&s;ent lo&s;&s;es, to oppo&s;e &s;ucce&s;sfully all the abilities and power of Edward: That Heaven it&s;e f could not &s;et a more glorious prize before the eyes either of virtue or ambition, than to conjoin in one object, the acqui&s;ition of royalty with the de|fence of national independance: And that as the intere&s;ts of his country, no

more than tho&s;e of a brave man, could never be &s;incerely cultivated by a &s;acri|fice of liberty, he him&s;elf was determined, as far as po&s;&s;ible, to prolong, not her mi&s;ery, but her freedom, and was de&s;irous, that his own life, as well as the ex|i&s;tence of the nation, might terminate, when they could no longer be pre&s;erved but by receiving the chains of a haughty victor. The gallantry of the&s;e &s;enti|ments, tho' delivered by an armed enemy, &s;truck the generous mind of Bruce: The flame was conveyed from the brea&s;t of one hero to that of another: He re|pented of his engagements with Edward; and opening his eyes to the honourable path, pointed out to him by Wallace, &s;ecretly determined to &s;eize the fir&s;t oppor|tunity of embracing the cau&s;e, however de&s;perate, of his oppre&s;&s;ed country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This &s;tory is told by all the Scots writers; tho' it mu&s;t be owned that Trivet and Hemingford, authors of good credit, both agree that Bruce was not in Edward's army.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>BRUCE, who had long harboured in his brea&s;t the de&s;ign of freeing his en&s;lav|ed country, ventured at la&s;t to open his mind to John Cummin, a powerful nobleman, with whom he lived in &s;trict intimacy. He found in his friend all the appearance of his own &s;entiments; and needed to employ no arts of per&s;ua&s;ion to make him embrace the re&s;olution of throwing off, on the fir&s;t favourable oppor|tunity, the u&s;urped dominion of the Engli&s;h. But on the departure of Bruce, who attended Edward to London, Cummin, who either had di&s;&s;embled all along with him, or began to reflect more coolly in his ab&s;ence on the de&s;perate nature of the undertaking, re&s;olved to attone for his crime of a&s;&s;enting to this rebellion, by the merit of revealing the &s;ecret to the King of England. Edward did not immediately commit Bruce to cu&s;tody; becau&s;e he propo&s;ed, at the &s;ame time, to &s;eize his three brothers, who re&s;ided in Scotland; and he contented him&s;elf with &s;ecretly &s;etting &s;pies upon him, and ordering all his motions to be &s;trictly guarded. A nobleman of Edward's court, Bruce's intimate friend, was appriz|ed of his danger; but not daring, amid&s;t &s;o many watchful eyes, to hold any conver&s;ation with him, he fell on an expedient to give him warning, that it was full time he &s;hould make his e&s;cape. He &s;ent him by a &s;ervant, a pair of gilt &s;purs and a pur&s;e of gold, which he pretended to have borrowed from him; and left it to the &s;agacity of his friend to di&s;cover the meaning of the pre&s;ent. Bruce immediately contrived the means of his e&s;cape; and as the ground was at that time covered with &s;now, he had the precaution, it is &s;aid, to order his hor&s;es to be &s;hod with their &s;hoes turned backwards, that he might deceive tho&s;e, who &s;hould track his path over the open fields or cro&s;s roads, thro' which he purpo&s;|ed to travel. He arrived in a few days at Dumfries in Annandale; the chief &s;eat of his family intere&s;t; and he happily found a great number of the Scotti&s;h nobi|lity there a&s;&s;embled, and among the re&s;t, John Cummin, his former a&s;&s;ociate.</P>

<PB N="119" REF="125">
the way for their en&s;uing &s;lavery; and by re&s;uming them, which was his firm purpo&s;e, he opened to them the joyful pro&s;pect of recovering from the frau|dulent u&s;urper their antient and hereditary independance: That all their pa&s;t misfortunes had proceeded from their di&s;union; and they would &s;oon appear no le&s;s formidable than of old to their enemies, if they now deigned to follow into the field their rightful prince, who knew no medium between death and victory: That their mountains and their valour, which had, during &s;o many ages, pro|tected their liberty from all the efforts of the Roman empire, would &s;till be &s;uf|ficient, were they worthy of their generous ancestors, to defend them again&s;t the utmo&s;t violence of the Engli&s;h tyrant: That it was unbecoming men, born to the mo&s;t antient independance, known in Europe, to &s;ubmit to the will of any ma&s;ters; but fatal to receive tho&s;e, who, being irritated by &s;uch per&s;evering op|po&s;ition, and enflamed with the highe&s;t animo&s;ity, would never deem them&s;elves &s;ecure of their u&s;urped dominion but by exterminating all the antient nobility, and even all the antient inhabitants: And that, being reduced to this de&s;perate extremity, it were better for them at once to peri&s;h, like brave men, with their &s;words in their hands, than to dread long, and at la&s;t undergo, the fate of the unfortunate Wallace, who&s;e merits, in the brave and ob&s;tinate defence of his country, were finally rewarded by the hands of an Engli&s;h executioner.</P>
<P>THE &s;pirit with which this di&s;cour&s;e was delivered, the bold &s;entiments which it conveyed, the novelty of Bruce's declaration, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the graces of his youth and manly deportment, made deep impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of his audience, and rouzed all tho&s;e principles of indignation and revenge, with which they had long been &s;ecretly actuated. The Scotti&s;h nobles declared their unanimous re|&s;olution to u&s;e the utmo&s;t efforts in delivering their country from bondage, and to &s;econd the courage of Bruce, in a&s;&s;erting his and their undoubted rights, again&s;t their common oppre&s;&s;ors. Cummin alone, who had &s;ecretly taken his mea&s;ures with the King, oppo&s;ed this general determination; and by repre&s;enting the great power of England, governed by a prince of &s;uch uncommon vigour and abilities, he endeavoured to &s;et before them the certain de&s;truction, which they mu&s;t ap|prehend, if they again violated their oaths of fealty, and &s;hook off their allegi|ance to the victorious Edward<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M.

Bruce, already apprized of his treachery, and for&s;eeing the certain failure of all his own &s;chemes of ambition and glory from the oppo&s;ition of &s;o potent a leader, took immediately his re&s;olution; and moved partly by re&s;entment, partly by policy, followed Cummin on the di&s;&s;olution of the a&s;&s;embly, attacked him in the cloy&s;ters of the Grey Friars thro' which he pa&s;|&s;ed, and running him thro' the body, left him for dead.

This deed of Bruce and his a&s;&s;ociates, which contains circum&s;tances, ju&s;tly condemned by our pre&s;ent manners, was regarded in that age as an effort of manly vigour and ju&s;t policy.

He re&s;tor|ed authority to the government, di&s;ordered by the weakne&s;s of his father; he maintained the laws again&s;t all the efforts of his turbulent barons; he fully annex|ed to his crown the principality of Wales; he took the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures for reducing Scotland to a like condition; and tho' the equity of this latter enterprize may rea&s;onably be que&s;tioned, the circum&s;tances of the two king|doms promi&s;ed &s;uch certain &s;ucce&s;s, and the advantage was &s;o vi&s;ible of uniting the whole i&s;land under one head, that tho&s;e who give great indulgence to rea&s;ons of &s;tate in the mea&s;ures of princes, will not be apt to regard this part of his con|duct with much &s;everity. But Edward, however exceptionable his character may appear on the head of ju&s;tice, is the model of a politic and warlike King: He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed indu&s;try, penetration, courage, vigour, and enterprize: He was frugal in all expences that were not nece&s;&s;ary; he knew how to open the public trea&s;ures on a proper occa&s;ion; he puni&s;hed criminals with &s;everity; he was gracious and affable to his &s;ervants and courtiers; and being of a maje&s;tic figure, expert at all bodily exerci&s;es, and in the main well proportioned in his limbs, notwith&s;tanding the great length and the &s;mallne&s;s of his legs, he was as well qualified to capti|vate the populace by his exterior appearance, as to gain the approbation of men of &s;en&s;e by his more &s;olid virtues.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mi&s;cellaneous tran&s;actions of this reign.</NOTE> BUT the chief advantage, which the people of England reaped, and &s;till con|tinue to reap, from the reign of this great prince, was the correction, exten&s;ion, amendment, and e&s;tabli&s;hment of the laws, which Edward maintained in great vigour, and left much improved to po&s;terity: For the work of wi&s;e legi&s;lators commonly remain; while the acqui&s;itions of conquerors often peri&s;h with them. This merit has ju&s;tly gained to Edward the appellation of the Engli&s;h Ju&s;tinian.

As law began now to be well e&s;tabli&s;hed, the abu&s;e of that happine&s;s began al&s;o to be remarked. In&s;tead of their former a&s;&s;ociations for robbery and violence, men entered into formal combinations to &s;upport each other in law-&s;uits; and it was found requi&s;ite to check this grievance by act of parliament<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Statute of Con&s;pirators.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE happened in this reign a con&s;iderable alteration in the execution of the laws: The King aboli&s;hed the office of chief ju&s;ticiary, which he thought po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed too much power, and was dangerous to the crown<NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">Spelman.

<P>BUT tho' Edward appeared thus, thro' his whole reign, a friend to law and ju&s;tice, it cannot be &s;aid, that he was an enemy to arbitrary power; and in a government more regular and legal than was that of England in his age, &s;uch practices as tho&s;e which may be remarked in his admini&s;tration, would have given &s;ufficient ground of complaint, and &s;ometimes were even in his age the object of general di&s;plea&s;ure. The violent plunder and bani&s;hment of the Jews; the putting the whole clergy, at once, out of the protection of law; the &s;eizing all the wool and leather of the kingdom; the heightening the impo&s;itions on the former valuable commodity; the new and illegal commi&s;&s;ion of Trail-ba&s;ton; the taking all the money and plate of mona&s;teries and churches, even before he had any quarrel with the clergy; the &s;ubjecting every man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of twenty
<PB N="123" REF="129">
pounds a year to military &s;ervice, tho' not bound to it by his tenure; his vi&s;ible reluctance to confirm the great charter, as if that conce&s;&s;ion had had no validity from the deeds of his predece&s;&s;ors; the captious clau&s;e which he at la&s;t annexed to his confirmation; his procuring, after all, the Pope's di&s;pen&s;ation from the oaths which he had taken to ob&s;erve that charter; and his levying of arbitrary talliages even after the &s;tatute, or rather charter, by which he had renounced that preroga|tive; the&s;e are &s;o many demon&s;trations of his arbitrary di&s;po&s;ition, and prove with what exception and re&s;erve we ought to celebrate his love of ju&s;tice. He took care that his &s;ubjects &s;hould do ju&s;tice to one another; but he de&s;ired always to have his own hands free in all his tran&s;actions, both with them and with his neigh|bours.</P>
<P>THE chief ob&s;truction to the execution of ju&s;tice in tho&s;e times was the power of the great barons; and Edward was perfectly qualified, by his character and abi|lities, to keep the&s;e tyrants in awe, and to re&s;train their illegal practices. This &s;alutary purpo&s;e was accordingly the great object of his attention; yet he was imprudently led into a mea&s;ure which tended very much to encrea&s;e and confirm their exorbitant authority. He pa&s;&s;ed a &s;tatute, which, by allowing them to en|tail their e&s;tates, made it impracticable to dimini&s;h the property of the great fa|milies, and left them all means of encrea&s;e and acqui&s;ition.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brady of burroughs, p. 25, from the records.</NOTE></P>
<P>EDWARD ob&s;erved a contrary policy with regard to the church: He &s;eems to have been the fir&s;t chri&s;tian prince who pa&s;&s;ed a &s;tatute of mortmain; and pre|vented by law the clergy from making new acqui&s;itions of lands, which by the eccle&s;ia&s;tical canons they were for ever prohibited to alienate. The oppo&s;ition between his maxims with regard to the nobility and eccle&s;ia&s;tics, leads us to con|jecture, that it was only by chance he pa&s;&s;ed the beneficial &s;tatute of mortmain, and that his &s;ole object was, to maintain the number of knights fees, and to pre|vent the &s;uperiors from being defrauded of the profits of ward&s;hip, marriage, livery, and other emoluments ari&s;ing from the feudal tenures. This is indeed the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned in the &s;tatute it&s;elf, and appears to have been his real object in enacting it. The author of the annals of Waverly a&s;cribes this act chiefly to the King's anxiety for maintaining the military force of the kingdom; but adds that he was much mi&s;taken in his purpo&s;e; for that the Amalekites were overcome more by the prayers of Mo&s;es than by the &s;word of the I&s;raelites<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 234. So al&s;o M. We&s;t. p. 409.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>EDWARD was very active in re&s;training the u&s;urpations of the church, and ex|cepting his ardour for Croi&s;ades, which adhered to him during his whole life, &s;eems, in other re&s;pects, to have been little infected with &s;uper&s;tition, the vice
<PB N="124" REF="130">
chiefly of weak minds. But the pa&s;&s;ion for Croi&s;ades was really in that age the pa&s;&s;ion for glory. As the Pope now felt him&s;elf &s;omewhat more re&s;trained in his former practice of pillaging the national churches by general impo&s;itions upon them, he permitted the generals of particular orders, who re&s;ided at Rome, to levy taxes on the &s;everal convents &s;ubjected to their juri&s;diction; and Edward was obliged to enact a law again&s;t this new abu&s;e. It was al&s;o become a practice of the court of Rome to provide &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to benefices before they became vacant: Edward found it likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;train by law this new &s;ource of inju&s;tice and impo&s;ition.</P>
<P>THE tribute of 1000 marks a year, to which King John, in doing homage to the Pope, had &s;ubjected the kingdom, had been pretty regularly paid &s;ince his time, tho' the va&s;&s;alage was con&s;tantly denied, and indeed, for fear of giving of|fence, had been but little in&s;i&s;ted on. The payment was called by a new name of <HI>cen&s;us,</HI> not by that of tribute. King Edward &s;eems to have always paid this money with great reluctance, and he &s;uffered it, at one time, to run on for &s;ix years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 2. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">.</NOTE>, at another for eleven<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 862</NOTE>: But as princes in that age &s;tood continually in need of the Pope's good offices, for di&s;pen&s;ations of marriages and other con|ce&s;&s;ions, the court of Rome found always means, &s;ooner or latter, to catch the money. The levying of fir&s;t fruits was al&s;o a new device, begun in this reign, by which his holine&s;s got his fingers very frequently into the pur&s;es of the faith|ful; and the King &s;eems unwarily to have given way to it.</P>
<P>EDWARD had by his fir&s;t wife, Eleanor of Ca&s;tile, four &s;ons, but Edward his heir and &s;ucce&s;&s;or, was the only one that &s;urvived him. She al&s;o bore him eleven daughters, mo&s;t of whom died in their infancy: Joan was married fir&s;t to the earl of Gloce&s;ter, and after his death, to Ralph de Monthermer; Mar|garet e&s;pou&s;ed John duke of Brabant: Elizabeth e&s;pou&s;ed fir&s;t John earl of Hol|land: and afterwards the earl of Hereford: Mary was a nun at Ambre&s;bury. He had by his &s;econd wife, Margaret of France, two &s;ons and a daughter; Tho|mas created earl of Norfolk, and Mare&s;chal of England; and Edmond who was created earl of Kent by his brother when King. The prince&s;s died in her in|fancy.</P>
<P>IN the former reign the taxes had been partly &s;cutages, partly a proportional part of the moveables, granted by parliament: In this, &s;cutages were entirely Crops; and the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment on moveables was the chief method of taxation. Ed|ward in his fourth year had a fifteenth granted him; in his fifth year a twelfth; in his eleventh year a thirtieth from the laity, a twentieth from the clergy; in
<PB N="125" REF="131">
his eighteenth year a fifteenth; in his twenty &s;econd year a tenth from the laity, a &s;ixth from London and other corporate towns, half of their benefices from the clergy; in his twenty third year an eleventh from the barons and others, a tenth from the clergy, a &s;eventh from the burge&s;&s;es; in his twenty fourth year a twelfth from the barons and others, an eighth from the burge&s;&s;es, from the clergy, no|thing, becau&s;e of the Pope's inhibition; in his twenty fifth year an eighth from the laity, a tenth from the clergy of Canterbury, a fifth from tho&s;e of York; in his twenty ninth year a fifteenth from the laity, on account of his confirming the perambulation of the fore&s;ts; the clergy granted nothing; in his thirty third year, fir&s;t a thirtieth from the barons and others, and a twentieth from the bur|ge&s;&s;es, then a fifteenth from all his &s;ubjects; in his thirty fourth year a thirtieth from all his &s;ubjects for knighting his elde&s;t &s;on.</P>
<P>THESE taxes were moderate; but the King had al&s;o duties upon exportation and importation granted him from time to time: The heavie&s;t was commonly upon wool. Poundage, or a &s;hilling a pound, was not regularly granted the Kings for life till the reign of Henry V.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1307" UNIT="year"> THE prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, entertained in favour of young Edward, kept the Eng|li&s;h from being fully &s;en&s;ible of the extreme lo&s;s, which they had &s;u&s;tained by the death of the great monarch, who filled the throne; and all men ha&s;tened with alacrity to take the oath of allegiance to his &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or. This prince was in the twenty-third year of his age, was of an agreeable figure, of a mild and gentle di&s;po&s;ition; and having never di&s;covered a propen&s;ity to any dangerous vice, it was very natural to progno&s;ticate tranquility and happine&s;s from his go|vernment. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Weakne&s;s of the King.</NOTE> But the fir&s;t act of his reign bla&s;ted all the&s;e hopes, and &s;hewed him to be totally unqualified for that perilous &s;ituation, in which every Engli&s;h mo|narch during tho&s;e ages, had, from the un&s;table form of the con&s;titution, and the turbulent di&s;po&s;itions of the people, derived from it, the misfortune to be placed. The indefatigable Robert Bruce, tho' his army had been di&s;&s;ipated and he him&s;elf had been obliged to take &s;helter in the we&s;tern i&s;les, remained not long in tranquility; but before the death of the late King, had &s;allied from his re|treat, had again collected his followers, had appeared in the field, and had obtained by &s;urprize an important advantage over Aymer de Valence, who commanded the Engli&s;h forces<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">.</NOTE>.

This young man &s;oon in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the affections of his ma&s;ter, by his agreeable behaviour, and by &s;up|plying him with all tho&s;e innocent, tho' frivolous amu&s;ements, which &s;uited his capacity and his inclinations. He was endowed with the utmo&s;t elegance of &s;hape and per&s;on, was noted for a fine mien and ea&s;y carriage, di&s;tingui&s;hed him|&s;elf in all warlike and genteel exerci&s;es, and was celebrated for tho&s;e quick &s;allies of wit, by which his country is di&s;tingui&s;hed.

<P><MILESTONE N="1308" UNIT="year"> THOMAS, earl of Lanca&s;ter, cou&s;in-german to the King, and fir&s;t prince of the blood, was by far the mo&s;t opulent and powerful &s;ubject in England, and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed in his own right, and &s;oon after in that of his wife, heire&s;s of the family of Lincoln, no le&s;s than &s;ix earldoms, with a proportional e&s;tate in land, attended with all the juri&s;dictions and power, which commonly in that age were annexed to landed property. He was turbulent and factious in his di&s;po&s;ition; mortally hated the favourite, who&s;e influence with the King exceeded his own; and he &s;oon became the head of that party among the barons, who de&s;ired the depre&s;&s;ion of this in|&s;olent &s;tranger.

<P>MEAN-WHILE, the King, le&s;s &s;hocked with the illegal violence which had been impo&s;ed upon him, than unhappy in the ab&s;ence of his minion, employed every expedient to &s;often the oppo&s;ition of the barons to his return; as if &s;ucce&s;s in that point were the chief object of his government. The high office of hereditary &s;teward was conferred on Lanca&s;ter: His father-in-law, the earl of Lincoln, was bought off by other conce&s;&s;ions: Earl Warrenne was al&s;o mollified by civilities, grants, or promi&s;es: The in&s;olence of Gava&s;ton, being no longer before men's eyes, was le&s;s the object of general indignation: And Edward, deeming matters &s;ufficiently prepared for his purpo&s;e, applied to the court of Rome, and obtained a di&s;pen&s;ation from that oath, which the barons had com|pelled Gava&s;ton to take, that he would abjure for ever the realm<NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 3. p. 167.</NOTE>. He went down to Che&s;ter, to receive him on his fir&s;t landing from Ireland; flew into his arms with tran&s;ports of joy; and having obtained the formal con&s;ent of the ba|rons in parliament to his re-e&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;et no longer any bounds to his extrava|gant fondne&s;s and affection. Gava&s;ton him&s;elf, forgetting his pa&s;t misfortunes, and blind to their cau&s;es, re&s;umed the &s;ame o&s;tentation and in&s;olence; and be|came more than ever the object of general dete&s;tation among the barons.</P>
<P>THE nobility fir&s;t di&s;covered their animo&s;ity by ab&s;enting them&s;elves from par|liament; and finding, that this expedient had not been &s;ucce&s;sful, they began to think of employing &s;harper and more effectual remedies.

<P><MILESTONE UNIT="year"> THE cho&s;en junto of twelve accordingly framed their ordinances, and pre&s;ented them to the King and parliament, for their confirmation in the en&s;uing year. Some of the&s;e ordinances were laudable, and tended to the regular execution of ju&s;tice: &s;uch as tho&s;e, requiring &s;heriffs to be men of property, aboli&s;hing the practices of i&s;&s;uing privy &s;eals for the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of ju&s;tice, re&s;training the prac|tice of purveyance, prohibiting the adulteration or alteration of the coin, exclud|ing foreigners from the farms of the revenue, ordering all payments to be regu|larly made into the exchequer, revoking all late grants of the crown, and giving the parties damages in the ca&s;e of vexatious pro&s;ecutions. But what chiefly grieved the King was the ordinance for the removal of evil coun&s;ellors, by which a great number of per&s;ons were by name excluded from every office of power and profit; and Piers Gava&s;ton him&s;elf was for ever bani&s;hed the King's domi|nions, under the penalty, in ca&s;e of di&s;obedience, of being declared a public enemy. Other per&s;ons, more agreeable to the barons, were &s;ub&s;tituted in all the offices. And it was ordained, that, for the future, all the con&s;iderable digni|ties in the hou&s;hold, as well as in the law, revenue, and military governments, &s;hould be appointed by the <HI>baronage</HI> in parliament; and the power of making

war, or a&s;&s;embling his military tenants, &s;hould no longer be &s;olely ve&s;ted in the King, nor be exerci&s;ed without the con&s;ent of the nobility.</P>
<P>EDWARD, from the &s;ame weakne&s;s both of his temper and &s;ituation, which had engaged him to grant this unlimited commi&s;&s;ion to the barons, was led to give a parliamentary &s;anction to their ordinances: But as a con&s;equence of the &s;ame character, he <HI>&s;ecretly</HI> made a prote&s;t again&s;t them, and declared, that, &s;ince the commi&s;&s;ion was granted only for the making of ordinances to the advantage of the King and kingdom, &s;uch articles, as &s;hould be found prejudicial to both, were to be held as not ratified and confirmed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ryley's Placit. Parl. p. 530, 541.</NOTE>. It is no wonder, indeed, that he re|tained a firm purpo&s;e to revoke ordinances, which had been impo&s;ed on him by violence, which entirely annihilated the royal authority, and above all, which deprived him of the company and &s;ociety of a per&s;on, whom, by an unu&s;ual in|fatuation, he valued above all the world, and above every other con&s;ideration of intere&s;t or tranquility.</P>
<P>SO &s;oon, therefore, as Edward, removing to York, had freed him&s;elf from the immediate terror of the baron's power, he invited back Gava&s;ton from Flan|ders, which that favourite had made the place of his retreat; and declaring his bani&s;hment to be illegal, and contrary to the laws and cu&s;toms of the kingdom<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Brady's App. N^o. 53.

The earl of Lanca&s;ter was a dangerous head of this alliance: Guy, earl of Warwic, entered into it with a furious and precipitate pa&s;&s;ion: Humphrey Bohun, earl of Hereford, the con&s;table, and Aymer de Va|lence, earl of Pembroke, brought to it a great acce&s;&s;ion of power and intere&s;t: Even earl Warrenne de&s;erted the royal cau&s;e, which he had hitherto &s;upported, and was induced to embrace the &s;ide of the confederates<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tri|vet, cont. p. 4.</NOTE>: And as Robert de Winchel&s;ey, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, declared him&s;elf of the &s;ame party, he determined the body of the clergy, and con&s;equently the people, to declare again&s;t the King and his minion. So predominant, at that time, was the power of the great nobility, that the combination of a few of them was always able to &s;hake the throne, and &s;uch an univer&s;al concurrence became irre&s;i&s;tible. The earl of Lanca&s;ter &s;uddenly rai&s;ed an army, and marched to York, where he found the King already removed to Newca&s;tle<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 101.</NOTE>: He flew thither in pur&s;uit of him;

and Edward had ju&s;t time to e&s;cape to Tinmouth, where he embarked, and &s;ailed with Gava&s;ton to Scarborough. He left his favourite in that fortre&s;s, which, had it been properly &s;upplied with provi&s;ions, was deemed impregnable; and he marched forward to York, in hopes of rai&s;ing an army, which might be able to &s;upport him again&s;t his enemies.

<P>THE King was retired northward to Berwic, when he heard of Gava&s;ton's mur|der; and his re&s;entment was proportioned to the affection which he had ever borne him, while living. He threatened vengeance on all the nobility, who had been active in that bloody &s;cene, and he made preparations for war in all parts of England. But being le&s;s con&s;tant in his enmities than in his friend&s;hips, he &s;oon after hearkened to terms of accommodation; granted the barons a pardon for all offences; and as they &s;tipulated to a&s;k him publicly pardon on their knees<NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">Ry|ley, 538. Rymer, vol. 3. p. 366.</NOTE>, he was &s;o plea&s;ed with the&s;e vain appearances of exterior &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, that he &s;eemed to have &s;incerely forgiven them all pa&s;t injuries. But as they &s;till pretended, notwith&s;tanding their lawle&s;s conduct, a great anxiety for the maintenance of law; and required the e&s;tabli&s;hment of their former ordinances as a nece&s;&s;ary &s;ecurity for that purpo&s;e; Edward told them, that he was willing to grant them a free and legal confirmation of &s;uch of the&s;e ordinances as were not entirely deroga|tory
<PB N="133" REF="139">
to the prerogatives of the crown. This an&s;wer was received for the pre&s;ent as &s;atisfactory. The King's per&s;on, after the death of Gava&s;ton, was now become le&s;s obnoxious to the public; and as the ordinances, in&s;i&s;ted on, appeared to be nearly the &s;ame with tho&s;e, who had been formerly extorted from Henry III. by Mountfort, and which had been attended with &s;o many fatal con&s;equences, they were, on that account, demanded with le&s;s vehemence by the nobility and people. The minds of all men &s;eemed to be much appea&s;ed towards each other: The animo&s;ities of faction no longer prevailed: And England, now united under its head, would henceforth be able, it was hoped, to take vengeance on all its ene|mies; particularly on the Scots, who&s;e progre&s;s was the object of general re&s;ent|ment and indignation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">War with Scotland.</NOTE> IMMEDIATELY after Edward's retreat from Scotland, Robert Bruce left his fa&s;tne&s;&s;es, in which he intended to have &s;heltered his feeble force; and &s;upplying his defect of power by &s;uperior vigour and abilities, he made deep impre&s;&s;ions on all his enemies, foreign and dome&s;tic. He chaced the lord Argyle and the chief|tain of the Macdonalds from their hills, and made him&s;elf entirely ma&s;ter of the high country: He thence invaded with &s;ucce&s;s the Cummins in the low countries of the north: He took the ca&s;tles of Inverne&s;s, Forfar, and Brechin: He gained daily &s;ome new acce&s;&s;ion of territory; and what was a more important acqui&s;i|tion, he daily reconciled the minds of the nobility to his dominion, and enli&s;ted under his &s;tandard every bold leader, whom he enriched by the &s;poils of his ene|mies. Sir James Douglas, in whom commenced the greatne&s;s and renown of that warlike family, &s;econded him in all his enterprizes: Edward Bruce, Robert's own brother, di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by actions of valour: And the terror of the Engli&s;h power being now abated by the feeble conduct of the King, even the lea&s;t &s;anguine of the Scots began to entertain hopes of recovering their indepen|dancy; and the whole kingdom, except a few &s;trong fortre&s;&s;es, which he had not the means to attack, had acknowleged the authority of Robert.</P>
<P>IN this &s;ituation, Edward found it nece&s;&s;ary to grant a truce to Scotland; and Robert &s;ucce&s;sfully employed this interval in con&s;olidating his power, and intro|ducing order into the civil government, disjointed by &s;uch a long continuance of war and factions. The interval was very &s;hort: The truce, ill ob&s;erved on both &s;ides, was at la&s;t openly violated; and war recommenced with greater fury than ever. Robert, not contented with defending him&s;elf, made &s;ucce&s;sful inroads into England, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted his needy followers by the plunder of that country, and taught them to de&s;pi&s;e the military genius of a nation, who had long been the ob|ject of their terror. Edward at la&s;t, rouzed from his lethargy, conducted an army into Scotland; and Robert, determined not to ri&s;que too much again&s;t an enemy
<PB N="134" REF="140">
&s;o much &s;uperior, retired again into his mountains. The King advanced beyond Edinburgh; but being de&s;titute of provi&s;ions, and being ill &s;upported by the En|gli&s;h nobility, who were then employed in framing their ordinances, he was &s;oon obliged to return home, without gaining any advantage over the enemy. But the appearing union of all the parties in England, after the death of Gava&s;ton, &s;eemed to re&s;tore that kingdom to its native force, opened again the pro&s;pect of &s;ubjecting Scotland, and promi&s;ed a happy conclu&s;ion to a war, in which both the intere&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions of the nation were &s;o deeply concerned.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="year"> EDWARD a&s;&s;embled forces from all quarters, with a view of fini&s;hing by one blow this important enterprize. He &s;ummoned the mo&s;t warlike of his va&s;&s;als from Ga&s;cony: He inli&s;ted troops from Flanders and other foreign countries: He invited over great numbers of the di&s;orderly Iri&s;h as to a certain prey: He join|ed to them a body of the Wel&s;h, who were actuated by like motives: And a&s;|&s;embling the whole military force of England, he marched to the frontiers with an army which according to the Scots writers amounted to an hundred thou&s;and men, but which was probably much inferior to that number<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We find in Rymer, vol. 3. p. 481. a li&s;t of all the infantry a&s;&s;embled from all parts of England and Wales; and they are only 21540. It is not likely therefore that the whole army could be near &s;o nu|merous as is reported.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE army, collected by Robert, exceeded not thirty thou&s;and combatants; but being compo&s;ed of men, who had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by many acts of va|lour, who were rendered de&s;perate by their &s;ituation, and who were enured to all the varieties of fortune, they might ju&s;tly, under &s;uch a leader, be deemed for|midable to the mo&s;t numerous and be&s;t appointed armies. The ca&s;tle of Stir|ling, which, with Berwic, was the only fortre&s;s of Scotland, that remained in the hands of the Engli&s;h, had been long be&s;ieged by Edward Bruce; and Philip de Mowbray, the governor, after an ob&s;tinate defence, was at la&s;t obliged to ca|pitulate, and to promi&s;e that if, before a certain day, which was now approach|ing, he was not relieved, he &s;hould open his gates to the enemy<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 3. p. 481.</NOTE>. Robert therefore, &s;en&s;ible, that here was the ground on which he mu&s;t expect the En|gli&s;h, cho&s;e the field of battle with all the &s;kill and prudence imaginable, and made the nece&s;&s;ary preparations for their reception. He po&s;ted him&s;elf at Bannock|burn, about two miles from Stirling: where he had a hill on his right flank, and a mora&s;s on his left: And not content with having taken the&s;e precautions to prevent his being &s;urrounded by the more numerous army of the Engli&s;h; he for&s;aw the &s;uperior &s;trength of the enemy in cavalry, and made provi&s;ions again&s;t it. Having a rivulet in front, he commanded deep pits to be dug along its
<PB N="135" REF="141">
banks, and &s;harp &s;takes to be planted in them, and he ordered the whole to be carefully covered over with turf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">T. de la More. p. 594.</NOTE>. The Engli&s;h arrived in &s;ight on the even|ing, and a bloody conflict immediately en&s;ued between two bodies of cavalry; where Robert, who was at the head of the Scots, engaged in &s;ingle combat with Henry de Bohun, a gentleman of the family of Hereford; and at one &s;troke cleft his adver&s;ary to the chin with a battle ax, in &s;ight of the two armies. The En|gli&s;h hor&s;e fled with precipitation to their main body.</P>
<P>THE Scots, encouraged by this favourable event, and glorying in the valour of their prince, progno&s;ticated a happy i&s;&s;ue to the combat on the en&s;uing day: The Engli&s;h, confident in their numbers, and elated with pa&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;es, longed for an opportunity of revenge: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Ban|nockburn.</NOTE> And the night, tho' extremely &s;hort in that &s;ea|&s;on and in that climate, appeared tedious to the impatience of the &s;everal comba|tants. <NOTE PLACE="marg">25th June.</NOTE> Early in the morning, Edward drew out his army, and advanced towards the Scots. The earl of Gloce&s;ter, his nephew, who commanded the left wing of cavalry, impelled by the ardour of youth, ru&s;hed on to the attack without pre|caution, and fell among the covered pits, which had been prepared by Bruce for the reception of the enemy<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">T. de la More. p. 594.</NOTE>. This body of hor&s;e was di&s;ordered: Gloce&s;ter him|&s;elf was overthrown and &s;lain: Sir James Douglas, who commanded the Scotti&s;h cavalry, gave the enemy no lei&s;ure to rally, but pu&s;hed them off the field with con&s;iderable lo&s;s, and pur&s;ued them in &s;ight of their whole line of infantry.

But always to throw, without di&s;tinction, the blame of all di&s;orders upon the prince, would introduce a fatal error in politics, and &s;erve as a perpetual apology for trea&s;on and rebellion: As if the turbulency of the great, and madne&s;s of the people, were not, equally with the tyranny of princes, an evil incident to human &s;ociety, and no le&s;s carefully to be guarded again&s;t in every well regulated con&s;titution.</P>

But tho' the&s;e cau&s;es had weakened the foundations of this order, once &s;o celebrated and revered, the immediate &s;ource of their de|&s;truction proceeded from the cruel and vindictive &s;pirit of Philip the Fair, who having entertained a private di&s;gu&s;t again&s;t &s;ome eminent templars, determined to gratify at once his avidity and revenge, by involving the whole order in one undi&s;tingui&s;hed ruin. On no better information, than that of two knights, con|demned by their superiors to perpetual impri&s;onment for their vices and profligacy; he ordered on one day all the templars of France to be committed to pri&s;on, and imputed to them &s;uch enormous and ab&s;urd crimes, as are &s;uffi|cient of them&s;elves to de&s;troy all the credit of the accu&s;ation.

The barbarous tyrant, enraged at this di&s;appointment, and thinking him&s;elf now engaged in honour to proceed to extremities, ordered fifty four of them, whom he branded as relap&s;ed heretics, to peri&s;h by the puni&s;hment of fire in his capital<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vertot, vol. 3. p. 132.

<P>IN all this barbarous inju&s;tice, Clement V. who was the creature of Philip, and then re&s;ided in France, fully concurred; and without examining a witne&s;s, or making any enquiry into the truth of facts, he &s;ummarily, by the plenitude of his apo&s;tolic power, aboli&s;hed the whole order.

<P>THE kingdom of England was afflicted with a grievous famine during &s;everal years of this reign. Perpetual rains and cold weather, not only de&s;troyed the harve&s;t, but bred a mortality among the cattle, and rai&s;ed every kind of food to an enormous price<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Trevet, cont. p. 17, 18.</NOTE>. The parliament, in 1315, endeavoured to fix more mo|derate rates on commodities; not &s;en&s;ible, that &s;uch an attempt was impracticable, and that, were it po&s;&s;ible to reduce the price of food by any other expedient

than introducing plenty, nothing could be more pernicious and de&s;tructive to the public. Where the produce of a year, for in&s;tance, falls &s;o far &s;hort, as to af|ford full &s;ub&s;i&s;tance only for nine months, the only expedient for making it la&s;t the whole twelve, is to rai&s;e the prices, to put the people by that means on &s;hort allowance, and oblige them to &s;pare their food, till a more plentiful year. But in reality, the encrea&s;e of prices is a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of &s;carcity; and laws, in&s;tead of preventing it, only encrea&s;e the evil, by cramping and re&s;training com|merce. The parliament accordingly, in the en&s;uing year, repealed their ordinance, which they had found u&s;ele&s;s and burden&s;ome<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;. p. 107.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE prices affixed by the parliament are &s;omewhat remarkable: Two pounds eight &s;hillings of our pre&s;ent money for the be&s;t ox, not fed with corn: If fed with corn, three pounds twelve &s;hillings: A fat hog of two years old, ten &s;hillings: A fat weather un&s;horn, a crown: If &s;horn, three &s;hillings and &s;ix pence: A fat goo&s;e, &s;even pence halfpenny: A fat capon, &s;ixpence: A fat hen, three pence: Two chickens, three pence: Four pigeons, three pence: Two dozen of eggs, three pence<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rot. Parl. 7. Edw. II. n. 35, 36. Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 502.</NOTE>. If we con&s;ider the&s;e prices, we &s;hall find, that butcher's meat, in this time of great &s;carcity, mu&s;t &s;till have been &s;old by the parliamentary ordinance, three times cheaper than our middling prices at pre&s;ent: Poultry &s;omewhat lower; becau&s;e, being now con&s;idered as a delicacy, it has ri&s;en beyond its proportion. In the country places of Ireland and Scotland, where delicacies bear no price, poultry is at pre&s;ent as cheap, if not cheaper, than butcher's meat. But the inference I would draw from the compari&s;on of prices is &s;till more con&s;iderable: I &s;uppo&s;e that the rates, affixed by parliament were inferior to the u&s;ual market prices in tho&s;e years of famine and mortality of cattle; and that the&s;e commodities, in&s;tead of a third, had really ri&s;en to a half of the pre&s;ent value. But the famine at that time was &s;o con&s;uming, that wheat was &s;ometimes &s;old for above four pounds ten &s;hillings a quarter<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Murimuth, p. 48. Wal&s;ingham, p. 108, &s;ays it ro&s;e to &s;ix pounds.</NOTE>, u&s;ually for three pounds<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 502. Trivet, cont. p. 18.</NOTE>; that is, con&s;iderably above twice our middling prices. A certain proof of the wretched &s;tate of tillage in tho&s;e ages. We formerly found, that the middling price of corn in that period was a half of the pre&s;ent value; while the middling price of cattle was only an eighth part: We here find the &s;ame immen&s;e di&s;proportion in years of &s;carcity. It may thence be inferred with certainty, that the rai&s;ing of corn was a &s;pecies of manufactory, which few in that age could practi&s;e with advantage: And there is rea&s;on to think, that other manufactures more refined, were &s;old even beyond their pre&s;ent prices: At lea&s;t there is a demon&s;tration for it in the reign of Hen|ry

During all tho&s;e times, it was u&s;ual for the princes and great nobili|ty to make &s;ettlements of their velvet beds and &s;ilken robes, in the &s;ame man|ner as of their e&s;tates and manors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, pa m.</NOTE>. In the li&s;t of jewels and plate, which had belonged to the o&s;tentatious Gava&s;ton, and which the King recovered from the earl of Lanca&s;ter after the murder of that favourite, we find &s;ome embroidered girdles, flowered &s;hirts, and &s;ilk wai&s;tcoats<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 3. p. 388.</NOTE>. It was afterwards one article of accu&s;ation again&s;t that potent and opulent earl, when tried for his life, that he had purloined &s;ome of the&s;e effects of Gava&s;ton. The ignorance of tho&s;e ages in manufactures, and e&s;pecially in tillage, is a clear proof that they were far from being populous.</P>
<P>ALL trade and manufactures indeed were then at a very low ebb. The only country in the northern parts of Europe, where they &s;eem to have ri&s;en to any tolerable degree of improvement, was Flanders. When Robert, earl of that coun|try, was applied to by Edward, and was de&s;ired to break off commerce with the Scots, whom Edward called his rebels, and repre&s;ented as excommunicated on that account by the church, the earl replied, that Flanders was always con&s;idered as common and free and open to all nations<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 3. p. 770.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE petition of the elder Spen&s;er to parliament, complaining of the deva&s;ta|tion committed on his lands by the barons, contains &s;everal particulars, which are curious, and di&s;cover the manners of the age<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Brady's hi&s;t. vol. 2. p. 143, from Clau&s;. 15. Edw. II. M. 14. Dors. in cedula:</NOTE>. He affirms, that they had ravaged &s;ixty three manors belonging to him, and he makes his lo&s;&s;es amount to 46,000 pounds; that is, to 138,000 of our pre&s;ent money. Among other par|ticulars, he enumerates 28,000 &s;heep, 1000 oxen and heifers, 1200 cows with their breed for two years, 560 cart hor&s;es, 2000 hogs, together with 600 ba|cons, 80 carca&s;&s;es of beef, and 600 muttons in the larder; ten tuns of cyder, arms for 200 men and other warlike engines and provi&s;ions. The plain inference is, that the greate&s;t part of Spen&s;er's va&s;t e&s;tate, as well as that of the other no|bility, was farmed by the landlord him&s;elf, managed by his &s;tewards or bailiffs, and cultivated by his villains. Little or none of it was let on lea&s;e to hu&s;band|men: Its produce was con&s;umed in ru&s;tic ho&s;pitality by the baron or his offi|cers: A great number of idle retainers, ready for any di&s;order or mi&s;chief, were maintained by him: All who lived upon his e&s;tate were ab&s;olutely at his di&s;po|&s;al: In&s;tead of applying to courts of ju&s;tice, he u&s;ually &s;ought redre&s;s by open force and violence: The great nobility were a kind of independant potentates, who, if they &s;ubmitted to any regulations at all, were le&s;s governed by the mu|nicipal
<PB N="154" REF="160">
law, than by a rude &s;pecies of the laws of nations. The method in which we find they treated the King's favourites, and mini&s;ters, is a proof of their u&s;ual way of dealing with each other. A party, which complains of the arbitrary con|duct of mini&s;ters, ought naturally to affect a great regard for the laws and con|&s;titution, and maintain at lea&s;t the appearance of ju&s;tice in their proceedings: Yet the&s;e barons, when di&s;contented, came to parliament with an armed force, con&s;trained the King to a&s;&s;ent to their mea&s;ures, and without any trial or wit|ne&s;s or conviction, pa&s;&s;ed, from the pretended notoriety of facts, an act of ba|ni&s;hment or attainder again&s;t the mini&s;ter, which, on the fir&s;t revolution of for|tune, was rever&s;ed by like expedients. The parliament, during factious times, was nothing but the organ of pre&s;ent power. Tho' the per&s;ons of whom it was chiefly compo&s;ed, &s;eemed to enjoy great independance, they really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no true liberty; and the &s;ecurity of each individual among them, was not &s;o much derived from the general protection of law, as from his own private power and that of his confederates. The authority of the monarch, tho' far from ab&s;olute, was very irregular, and might often reach him: The current of a faction might ea&s;ily overwhelm him: A hundred con&s;iderations, of benefits and injuries, friend|&s;hips and animo&s;ities, hopes and fears, were able to influence his conduct; and amid&s;t the&s;e motives a regard to equity and law and ju&s;tice was commonly, in tho&s;e rude ages, of little moment. Nor did any man entertain thoughts of op|po&s;ing pre&s;ent power, who did not deem him&s;elf &s;trong enough to di&s;pute the field with it by force, and was not prepared to give battle to the &s;overeign or the ruling party.</P>
<P>BEFORE I conclude this reign, I cannot forbear making another remark drawn from the detail of lo&s;&s;es given in by the elder Spen&s;er; particularly the great quantity of &s;alt meat which he had in his larder, 600 bacons, 80 carca&s;&s;es of beef, 600 muttons. We may ob&s;erve that the outrage, of which he complains, began after the third of May, as we learn from the &s;ame paper. It is ea&s;y there|fore to conjecture what a va&s;t &s;tore of the &s;ame kind he mu&s;t have laid up at the beginning of winter; and we may draw a new conclu&s;ion with regard to the wretched &s;tate of the antient hu&s;bandry, which could not provide any &s;ub&s;i&s;tance for the cattle during winter, even in &s;uch a temperate climate as the &s;outh of England: For Spen&s;er had but one manor &s;o far north as York&s;hire. There being few or no enclo&s;ures, except perhaps for deer, no &s;own gra&s;s, little hay, and no other re&s;ources for feeding cattle; the barons, as well as the people, were obliged to kill and &s;alt their oxen and &s;heep at the beginning of winter, before they became lean upon the common pa&s;ture: A precaution &s;till practi&s;ed with re|gard to oxen in the lea&s;t cultivated parts of this i&s;land. The &s;alting of mutton
<PB N="155" REF="161">
is a mi&s;erable expedient which has every where been long di&s;u&s;ed. From this cir|cum&s;tance, however trivial in appearance, may be drawn very important inferences, with regard to the dome&s;tic oeconomy and manner of life in tho&s;e ages.</P>
<P>THE di&s;orders of the times, from foreign wars and inte&s;tine di&s;&s;entions, but above all, the cruel famine, which obliged the nobility to di&s;mi&s;s many of their retainers, encrea&s;ed the number of robbers in the kingdom; and no place was &s;e|cure from their incur&s;ions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ypod.

All the attainders al&s;o, which had pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t the earl of Lanca&s;ter and his adherents, when the chance of war turned again&s;t them, were ea&s;ily rever&s;ed during the triumph of their par|ty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 4. p. 245, 257, 258, &amp;c.</NOTE>; and the Spen&s;ers, who&s;e former attainder had been rever&s;ed by parliament, were now again, in this change of fortune, condemned by the votes of their ene|mies. A council of regency was likewi&s;e appointed by parliament, con&s;i&s;ting of twelve per&s;ons; five prelates, the archbi&s;hops of Canterbury and York, the bi|&s;hops of Winche&s;ter, Worce&s;ter, and Hereford; and &s;even lay peers, the earls of Norfolk, Kent and Surrey, and the lords Wake, Ingham, Piercy, and Ro&s;s.

the pre&s;ent opportunity favourable for infe&s;ting England: He fir&s;t made an at|tempt on the ca&s;tle of Norham, in which he was di&s;appointed; he then collected an army of 25,000 men on the frontiers, and having appointed the earl of Mur|ray and lord Douglas generals, threatened an incur&s;ion into the northern coun|ties. The Engli&s;h regency, after trying in vain every expedient to re&s;tore peace with Scotland, made vigorous preparations for war; and be&s;ides a&s;&s;embling an Engli&s;h army of near &s;ixty thou&s;and men, they invited back John de Hainault, and &s;ome foreign cavalry, whom they had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and who&s;e di&s;cipline and arms had appeared &s;uperior to tho&s;e of their own country. Young Edward him&s;elf, burning with a pa&s;&s;ion for military fame, appeared at the head of the&s;e numerous forces; and marched from Durham, the appointed place of rende|vous, in que&s;t of the enemy, who had already broke into the frontiers, and were laying every thing wa&s;te around him with fire and &s;word.</P>
<P>MURRAY and Douglas were the two mo&s;t celebrated warriors, bred in the long ho&s;tilities between the Scots and Engli&s;h; and their forces, trained in the &s;ame &s;chool, and enured to hard&s;hips, fatigues, and dangers, were perfectly qua|lified, by their habits and manner of life, for that de&s;ultory and de&s;tructive war, which they carried on again&s;t the Engli&s;h. Except a body of about 4000 ca|valry, well armed, and fit to make a &s;teddy impre&s;&s;ion in battle, the re&s;t of the army were mounted on &s;mall hor&s;es, which found &s;ub&s;i&s;tance every where, and carried them with rapid and unexpected marches, whether they meant to commit depredations on the peaceable inhabitants, or to attack an armed enemy, or to retreat into their own country. The whole equipage of the troops con&s;i&s;ted of a bag of oat meal, which, as a &s;upply in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, each &s;oldier carried be|hind him; together with a light plate of iron, on which he in&s;tantly baked the oat meal into a cake, in the open fields. But his chief &s;ub&s;i&s;tance was the cattle which he &s;eized; and his cookery was as expeditious as all his other operations. After fleaing the animal, he placed the &s;kin, loo&s;e and hanging in the form of a bag, upon &s;ome &s;takes; he poured water into it, kindled a fire below, and thus made it &s;erve as a cauldron for the boiling of his victuals<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;ard, liv. 4. chap. 18.</NOTE>.</P>

Tho' the flame and &s;moke of burning villages directed him &s;ufficiently to the place of their encampment, he found upon hurrying thither, that they were already departed, and he &s;oon di&s;covered, by new marks of deva&s;tation, that they had removed to &s;ome di&s;tant quarter. After harra&s;&s;ing his army during

&s;ome time in this fruitle&s;s chace, he advanced northwards, and cro&s;&s;ed the Tyne, with a re&s;olution of awaiting them on their return homewards, and taking ven|geance on them for all their depredations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 4. chap. 19.</NOTE>. But that whole country was already &s;o much wa&s;ted by their frequent incur&s;ions, that it could not afford &s;ub&s;i&s;tance to his army; and he was obliged again to return &s;outhwards, and change his plan of operations. He had now lo&s;t all tract of the enemy; and tho' he pro|mi&s;ed the reward of a hundred pounds a year to any one who &s;hould bring him an account of their motions, he remained unactive &s;ome days, before he received any intelligence of them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 4. p. 312. Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 4. chap. 19.</NOTE>. He found at la&s;t, that they had fixed their camp on the &s;outhern banks of the Were, as if they intended to await a battle; but their prudent leaders had cho&s;en the ground with &s;uch judgment, that the Engli&s;h, on their approach, found it impracticable, without temerity, to cro&s;s the river in their face, and attack them in their pre&s;ent &s;ituation. Edward, impatient for revenge and glory, here &s;ent them a defiance, and challenged them, if they dared, to meet him in an equal field, and try the fortune of arms. The bold &s;pirit of Douglas could ill brook this bravado, and he advi&s;ed the acceptance of the chal|lenge; but he was over-ruled by Murray, who replied to Edward, that he never took the council of an enemy in any of his operations. The King, therefore, kept &s;till his po&s;ition oppo&s;ite to them; and expected daily, that nece&s;&s;ity would oblige them to change their quarters, and give him an opportunity of over|whelming them with his &s;uperior forces. After a few days, they &s;uddenly de|camped, and marched farther up the river; but &s;till po&s;ted them&s;elves in &s;uch a manner, as to pre&s;erve the advantage of the ground, if the enemy &s;hould ven|ture to attack them<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;|&s;art, liv. 4 chap. 19.</NOTE>.

<P>THE King was highly incen&s;ed at the di&s;appointment, which he had met with, in his fir&s;t enterprize, and at the head of &s;o gallant an army. The &s;ymptoms, which he had di&s;covered of bravery and &s;pirit, gave extreme &s;atisfaction, and were regarded as &s;ure progno&s;tics of an illu&s;trious reign: But the general di&s;plea|&s;ure fell violently on Mortimer, who was already the object of public odium: And every mea&s;ure which he pur&s;ued, tended to aggravate, beyond all bounds, the hatred of the nation both again&s;t him and Queen I&s;abella.</P>
<P>WHEN the council of regency was formed, Mortimer, tho' in the plenitude of his power, had taken no care to en&s;ure a place in it; but this &s;emblance of moderation was only a cover to the mo&s;t exorbitant and mo&s;t ambitious projects. He rendered that council entirely u&s;ele&s;s by u&s;urping to him&s;elf the whole &s;ove|reign power; he &s;ettled on the Queen-dowager the greater part of the royal re|venues; he never con&s;ulted either the princes of the blood or the other noblemen in any public mea&s;ure; the King him&s;elf was &s;o be&s;ieged by his creatures, that no acce&s;s could be procured to him; and all the envy, which had attended Gava|&s;ton and Spen&s;er, fell much more de&s;ervedly on this new favourite.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1328" UNIT="year"> MORTIMER, &s;en&s;ible of the growing hatred of the people, thought it requi&s;ite, on any terms, to &s;ecure peace abroad; and he entered into a negociation with Robert Bruce for that purpo&s;e.

<P><MILESTONE N="1332" UNIT="year"> EDWARD BALIOL, the &s;on of that John, who was crowned King of Scot|land, had been detained &s;ome time a pri&s;oner in England after his father was relea&s;ed; but having al&s;o obtained his liberty, he went over to France, and lived in Normandy, on his patrimonial e&s;tate in that country, without any thoughts of reviving the claims of his family upon the crown of Scotland. His preten&s;ions, however plau&s;ible, had been &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly abjured by the Scots, and rejected by the Engli&s;h, that he was entirely regarded as a private per&s;on; and he had been thrown into pri&s;on on account of &s;ome private offence again&s;t the laws, of which he was accu&s;ed.

<P>THE injured nobles, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch a head, began now to think of vindi|cating their rights by force of arms; and they applied to Edward for his concur|rence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But there were &s;everal rea&s;ons, which deterred the King from openly avowing their enterprize. In his treaty with Scotland, he had en|tered into a bond of 20,000 pounds, payable to the Pope, if within four years he violated the peace; and as the term was not yet elap&s;ed, he dreaded the exact|ing of that penalty, by the &s;overeign pontiff, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;o many means of forcing him to make payment. He was al&s;o afraid, that violence and inju&s;tice would every where be imputed to him, if he attacked with &s;uch &s;uperior force a minor King, and a brother-in-law, who&s;e independant title had &s;o lately been acknow|ledged by a &s;olemn treaty. And as the regent of Scotland, on every demand which had been made, of re&s;titution to the Engli&s;h barons, had always confe&s;&s;ed

the justice of their claim, and had only given an eva&s;ive an&s;wer, grounded on plau&s;ible pretences, Edward re&s;olved not to proceed to open violence, but to em|ply like artifices again&s;t him. He &s;ecretly encouraged Baliol in his enterprize; connived at his a&s;&s;embling forces in the north; and gave countenance to the no|bles, who were di&s;po&s;ed to join in the attempt. A force of near 2500 men was inli&s;ted under Baliol, by Um&s;reville earl of Angus, the lords Beaumont, Ferrars, Fitz-warin, Wake, Stafford, Talbot, and Moubray. And as the&s;e adventurers apprehended that the frontiers would be &s;trongly armed and guarded, they re|&s;olved to make their attack by &s;ea; and having embarked at Raven&s;pur, they reached in a few days the coa&s;t of Fife.</P>

Baliol &s;eized the favourable opportunity, advanced his troops upon them, prevented them from rallying, and chaced them anew off the field with redoubled &s;laughter. There fell above 12,000 Scots in this action; and among the&s;e the flower of their nobility; the regent him&s;elf, the earl of Carric, a natural &s;on of their late King, the earls of Athole and Monteith, the lord Hay of Errol, con&s;table, and the lords Keith and Lind&s;ey.

<P>AS the Scots expected, that the chief brunt of the war would fall upon Ber|wic, Douglas, the regent, threw a &s;trong garri&s;on into that place under the com|mand of Sir William Keith, and he him&s;elf a&s;&s;embled a great army on the fron|tiers, ready to penetrate into England, &s;o &s;oon as Edward &s;hould have inve&s;ted that fortre&s;s.

<P>AFTER this fatal blow, the Scotti&s;h nobles had no other re&s;ource but in&s;tant &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and Edward, leaving a con&s;iderable body with Baliol to compleat the conque&s;t of the kingdom, returned with the remainder of his army into Eng|land.

<P><MILESTONE N="1334" UNIT="year"> IF Baliol, on his fir&s;t appearance, was dreaded by the Scots, as an in&s;trument employed by England for the &s;ubjection of the kingdom, this deed confirmed all their &s;u&s;picions, and rendered him the object of univer&s;al hatred. Whatever &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ions they might be obliged to make, they con&s;idered him, not as their prince, but as the delegate and confederate of their determined enemy; and neither the manners of the age, nor the &s;tate of Edward's revenue permitting him to main|tain a con&s;tant &s;tanding army in Scotland, the Engli&s;h forces were no &s;ooner withdrawn, than the Scots revolted again&s;t Baliol, and returned to their former allegiance under Bruce.

<P><MILESTONE UNIT="year"> WE now come to a tran&s;action, on which depended the mo&s;t memorable events,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">.</NOTE> not only of this long and active reign, but of the whole Engli&s;h and French hi&s;to|ry, during more than a century; and it will therefore be nece&s;&s;ary to give a par|ticular account of the &s;prings and cau&s;es of it. It had long been a prevailing opinion, that the crown of France could never de&s;cend to females; and as na|tions, in accounting for principles, whish they regard as fundamental and as pe|culiar to them&s;elves, are fond of grounding them rather on primary laws, than on blind cu&s;tom, it had been u&s;ual to derive this maxim from a clau&s;e in the Sa|lian Code, the law of an antient tribe among the Franks; tho' that clau&s;e, when &s;trictly examined, carries only the appearance of favouring this principle, and does not rea ly, by the confe&s;&s;ion of the be&s;t critics, bear the &s;en&s;e commonly impo&s;ed upon it. But tho' po&s;itive law &s;eems wanting among the French for the exclu&s;ion of females, the practice had prevailed; and the rule was e&s;tabli&s;hed beyond controver&s;y on &s;ome antient as well as &s;ome modern precedents. During the fir&s;t race of the monarchy, the Franks were &s;o rude and barbarous a people, that they were incapable of &s;ubmitting to a female reign; and in that period of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">&s;tory, there were frequent in&s;tances of kings advanced to royalty in prejudice of females, who were related to the crown by nearer degrees of con&s;anguinity. The&s;e precedents, joined to like cau&s;es, had al&s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed the male &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is the &s;econd race; and tho' the in&s;tances were neither &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> frequent nor &s;o certain during that period, the principle of excluding the female line &s;eems &s;till to have prevai ed, and to have directed the conduct of the nation. During the third race, the crown had de&s;cended from father to &s;on for eleven generations, from Hugh Capet to Lewis Hutin; and thus, in fact, during the cour&s;e of nine hundred years, the French monarchy had always been governed by males, and
<PB N="169" REF="175">
no female and none de&s;cended of females had ever mounted the throne. Philip the Fair, father of Lewis Hutin, left three &s;ons, this Lewis, Philip the Long, and Charles the Fair, and one daughter, I&s;abella, queen of England. Lewis Hutin, the elde&s;t, left at his death one daughter, by Margaret &s;i&s;ter to Eudes, duke of Burgundy; and as his queen was then pregnant, Philip, his younger brother, was appointed regent, till it &s;hould appear whether &s;he was delivered of a &s;on or daughter. Her i&s;&s;ue proved male, but lived only a few days: Philip was pro|claimed King: And as the duke of Burgundy made &s;ome oppo&s;ition, and a&s;&s;erted the right of his niece, the &s;tates of the kingdom, by a &s;olemn and deliberate de|cree, gave her the exclu&s;ion, and declared all females for ever incapable of &s;uc|ceeding to the crown of France. Philip died after a &s;hort reign, leaving three daughters; and his brother, Charles, without di&s;pute or controver&s;y, then &s;uc|ceeded to the crown. The reign of Charles was al&s;o &s;hort: He le&s;t one daugh|ter; but as his queen was pregnant, the next male heir was appointed regent, with a declared right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, if the i&s;&s;ue &s;hould prove female. This prince was Philip de Valois, cou&s;in german to the decea&s;ed King; being the &s;on of Charles de Valois, brother of Philip the Fair. The queen of France was deliver|ed of a daughter: The regency ended; and Philip de Valois was unanimou&s;ly placed on the throne of France.</P>
<P>THE King of England, who was at that time a youth of fifteen years of age, embraced a notion, that he was intitled, in right of his mother, to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the kingdom, and that the claim of the nephew was preferable to that of the cou&s;in german. There could not well be conceived a notion weaker or wor&s;e grounded. The principle of excluding females was of old an e&s;tabli&s;hed opinion in France, and had acquired equal authority with the mo&s;t expre&s;s and po&s;itive law: It was &s;upported by antient precedents: It was confirmed by recent in&s;tan|ces, &s;olemnly and deliberately decided: And what placed it &s;till farther beyond controver&s;y; if Edward was di&s;po&s;ed to que&s;tion its validity, he thereby cut off his own preten&s;ions; &s;ince the three la&s;t Kings had all left daughters, who were &s;till alive, and who &s;tood before him in the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. He was there|fore reduced to a&s;&s;ert, that, tho' his mother, I&s;abella, was, on account of her &s;ex, incapable of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, he him&s;elf, who inherited thro' her, was liable to no &s;uch objection, and might claim by the right of propinquity. But, be&s;ides that this preten&s;ion was more favourable to Charles, King of Navarre, de&s;cended from the daughter of Lewis Hutin, it was &s;o contrary to the e&s;tabli&s;hed principles of &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion in every country of Europe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, lib. 1. chap. 4.</NOTE>, was &s;o repugnant to the practice both in private and public inheritances, that no body in France thought of Edward's right: Phi|lip's
<PB N="170" REF="176">
title was univer&s;ally recognized and acknowledged<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, lib 1. chap. 22.</NOTE>: And he never imagined, that he had a competitor; much le&s;s, &s;o formidable a one as the King of England.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the youthful and ambitious mind of Edward had ra&s;hly entertained this notion, he dit not think proper to in&s;i&s;t on his preten&s;ions, which mu&s;t have immediately involved him, on very unequal terms, in a dangerous and impla|cable war with &s;o powerful a monarch. Philip was a prince of mature years, of great experience, and at that time of an e&s;tabli&s;hed character both for prudence and valour; and by the&s;e circum&s;tances, as well as by the union of his people, and their acquie&s;cence in his undoubted right, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every advantage over a raw youth, newly rai&s;ed, by inju&s;tice and violence, to the government of the mo&s;t intractable and mo&s;t turbulent &s;ubjects in Europe. But there immediately occurred an incident, which required, that Edward &s;hould either openly declare his preten&s;ions, or for ever renounce and abjure them. He was &s;ummoned to do homage for Guienne: Philip was preparing to compel him by force of arms: That country was in a very bad &s;tate of defence: And the forfeiture of &s;o rich an inheritance was, by the feudal law, the immediate con&s;equence of his re&s;u&s;ing or declining to perform the duty of a va&s;&s;al. Edward therefore thought it pru|dent to &s;ubmit to pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity: He went over to Amiens: Did homage to Philip: And as there had ari&s;en &s;ome controver&s;y concerning the terms of this &s;ubm &s;&s;ion, he afterwards &s;ent over a formal deed, in which he acknowledged that he owed liege homage to the crown of France<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol 2. p. 477, 481.

His own claim indeed was &s;o unrea&s;onable, and &s;o thoroughly di&s;avowed by the whole French nation, that to in&s;i&s;t on it was no better than to pretend to the en|tire conque&s;t of the kingdom; and it is probable that he would never have far|ther thought of it, had it not been for &s;ome incidents, which excited an animo|&s;ity between the two monarchs.</P>
<P>ROBERT D'ARTOIS was de&s;cended of the royal blood of France, was a man of great character and authority, had e&s;pou&s;ed Philip's &s;i&s;ter, and by his birth, talents, and credit was entitled to make the highe&s;t figure, and to fill the mo&s;t important offices, in the monarchy. This prince had lo&s;t the county of Artois, which he claimed as his birthright, by a &s;entence, commonly deemed iniquitous, of Philip the Fair; and he was &s;educed to attempt the recovering po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by an action, &s;o unworthy of his rank and character as a forgery<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 29.</NOTE>. The detection of this crime covered him with &s;hame and confu&s;ion: His brother in law not

only abandoned him, but pro&s;ecuted him with violence: Robert, incapable of bearing di&s;grace, left the kingdom, and hid him&s;elf in the Low Countries: Being chaced from that retreat, by the authority and menaces of Philip, he came over to England, was favourably received by Edward<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 4. p. 747. Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 27.</NOTE>, and was &s;oon admitted into the councils and &s;hared the confidence of that monarch. Abandoning him&s;elf to all the movements of rage and de&s;pair, he endeavoured to revive the prepo&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions entertained by Edward in favour of his title to the crown of France, and even flattered him, that it was not impo&s;&s;ible for a prince of his valour and abili|ties, to render his claim effectual. The King was the more di&s;po&s;ed to hearken to &s;ugge&s;tions of this nature, becau&s;e he had, in &s;everal particulars, complaints again&s;t Philip's conduct with regard to Guienne, and becau&s;e that prince had both given protection to the exiled David Bruce, and &s;upported, or at lea&s;t encouraged the Scots in their &s;truggles for independancy. Thus re&s;entment gradually filled the brea&s;ts of the two monarchs, and made them incapable of hearkening to any terms of accommodation, propo&s;ed by the Pope, who never cea&s;ed interpo&s;ing his good offices between them. Philip thought, that he would be wanting to the fir&s;t principles of policy, if he abandoned Scotland: Edward pretended, that he mu&s;t relinqui&s;h all preten&s;ions to genero&s;ity, if he withdrew his protection from Robert d'Artois. The former, informed of &s;ome preparations for ho&s;tilities, which had been made by his rival, i&s;&s;ued a &s;entence of felony and forfeiture again&s;t Robert d'Artois, and declared, that every va&s;&s;al of the crown, whether <HI>within</HI> or <HI>without</HI> the kingdom, who gave countenance to that traitor was involved in the &s;ame &s;entence; a menace ea&s;y to be under&s;tood: The latter, re&s;olute not to yield, endeavoured to form alliances in the Low Countries and on the frontiers of Ger|many, the only places from which he either could make an effectual attack upon France, or produce &s;uch a diver&s;ion as might &s;ave the province of Guienne, which lay &s;o much expo&s;ed to the power of Philip.</P>

It was probably difficult for them to bring their &s;overeign and their nobility to conform them&s;elves to the principles of law and civil government, &s;o much neglected in every other country: It was im|po&s;&s;ible for them to confine them&s;elves within the proper bounds in their oppo|&s;ition and re&s;entment: They had ri&s;en in tumults: Had in&s;ulted the nobles: Had chaced their earl into France: And delivering them&s;elves over to the guidance of a &s;editious leader, had practiced all tho&s;e in&s;olences and di&s;orders, which the thoughtle&s;s and enraged populace are &s;o much inclined to commit, wherever they are &s;o unfortunate as to be their own ma&s;ters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 30.

<P>THEIR pre&s;ent leader was James d'Arteville, a brewer in Ghent, who govern|ed them with a more ab&s;olute &s;way than ever had been a&s;&s;umed by any of their lawful &s;overeigns: He placed and di&s;placed the magi&s;trates at his plea&s;ure: He was accompanied with a guard, who on the lea&s;t &s;ignal from him, in&s;tantly a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated any man who happened to fall under his di&s;plea&s;ure: All the cities of Flanders were full of his &s;pies; and it was immediate death to give him the &s;malle&s;t umbrage: The few nobles, who remained in the country, lived in continual terror of his violence: He &s;eized the e&s;tates of all tho&s;e whom he had either bani&s;hed or murdered; and be&s;towing a part on their wives and chil|dren, converted the remainder to his own u&s;e<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 30.</NOTE>.

&s;ource of their opulence, readily embraced the intere&s;ts of Edward, and invited him over into the Low Countries.

And the more to &s;trengthen his hands, he obtained from them a grant of 20,000 &s;acks of wool; which might amount to above a hundred thou&s;and pounds: This wool was a good in&s;trument to employ with the Flemings; and the price of it with his German allies. He compleated the other nece&s;&s;ary &s;ums by loans, by pawning the crown jewels, by confi&s;cating or rather robbing at once all the Lom|bards, who now exerci&s;ed the invidious trade, formerly monopolized by the Jews, of lending on intere&s;t<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dugd.

This &s;tep, which, he feared, would de&s;troy all fu|ture amity between the kingdoms, and beget endle&s;s and implacable jealou&s;ies in France, was not taken by him without much reluctance and he&s;itation: And as it was not in it&s;elf very ju&s;tifiable, it was in the i&s;&s;ue attended with many mi&s;e|ries to both nations. From this period we may date the commencement of that great animo&s;ity, which the Engli&s;h have ever &s;ince borne to the French, which has &s;o vi&s;ible an influence on all future tran&s;actions, and which has been, and continues to be the &s;pring of many ra&s;h and precipitate re&s;olutions among them. In all the preceding reigns &s;ince the conque&s;t, the ho&s;tilities between the two crowns had been only ca&s;ual and temporary; and never being attended with any bloody or dangerous events, the traces of them were ea&s;ily obli|terated by the fir&s;t treaty of pacification. The Engli&s;h nobility and gentry va|lued them&s;elves on their French or Norman extraction: They affected to employ the language of that country in all public tran&s;actions, and even in familiar con|ver&s;ation: And as both the Engli&s;h court and camp were always full of nobility, who came from &s;ome province or other of France, the two people were during

&s;everal centuries more intermingled together than any two di&s;tinct nations, whom we meet with in hi&s;tory. But the fatal preten&s;ions of Edward III. di&s;&s;olved all the&s;e connexions, and left the &s;eeds of great animo&s;ity in both countries, e&s;pecial|ly among the Engli&s;h. For it is remarkable, that this latter nation, tho' they were commonly the aggre&s;&s;ors, and by their &s;ucce&s;s and &s;ituation were enabled to commit the mo&s;t cruel injuries on the other, have always retained a &s;tronger tincture of national antipathy; nor is their hatred retaliated on them to an equal degree by the French. That country lies in the middle of Europe, has been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively engaged in ho&s;tilities with all its neighbours, the popular prejudices have been diverted into many channels, and, among a people of &s;ofter manners, they never ro&s;e to a great height again&s;t any particular nation.</P>
<P>PHILIP made great preparations again&s;t the attack of the Engli&s;h, and &s;uch as &s;eemed more than &s;ufficient to &s;ecure him from the danger. Be&s;ides the con|currence of all the nobility in his own populous and warlike kingdom, his foreign alliances were both more cordial and powerful than tho&s;e which were formed by his antagoni&s;t. The Pope, who, at this time, lived in Avignon, was dependant on France, and being di&s;gu&s;ted at the connexions between Edward and Lewis of Bavaria, whom he had excommunicated, he embraced with zeal and &s;incerity the cau&s;e of the French monarch. The King of Navarre, the duke of Britanny, the count de Bar were in the &s;ame intere&s;ts; and on the &s;ide of Germany, the King of Bohemia, the palatine, the dukes of Lorraine and Au&s;tria, the bi&s;hop of Liege, the counts de Deuxpont, Vaudemont, and Geneva. The allies of Edward were in them&s;elves weaker; and having no other object, but his money, which began to be exhau&s;ted, they were very &s;low in their motions and very irre&s;olute in their mea&s;ures. <MILESTONE N="1339" UNIT="year"> The duke of Brabant, the mo&s;t powerful among them, &s;eemed even inclined to withdraw him&s;elf wholly from the alliance; and the King was nece&s;|&s;itated, both to give the Brabanters new privileges in trade, and to contract his &s;on Edward with the daughter of that prince, ere he could bring him to fulfill his engagements. The &s;ummer was wa&s;ted in conferences and negotiations be|fore Edward could lead his armies into the field; and he was obliged, in order to a&s;&s;ure his German allies into his mea&s;ures, to pretend that the fir&s;t attack &s;hould be made upon Cambray, a city of the empire which had been garri&s;oned by Phi|lip<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 39.

But finding by a nearer in&s;pection the difficulty of the enterprize upon this place, he conducted them towards the frontiers of France; and he there found, by a &s;en&s;ible proof, the vanity of his expectations: The count de Namur, and even the count de Hainault, his brother-in-law (for the old count was dead) re|fu&s;ed

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">War with France.</NOTE> THE King however entered the enemy's country, and encamped on the fields of Vironfo&s;&s;e near Capelle, with an army of near 50,000 men, compo&s;ed almo&s;t entirely of foreigners.

But the Engli&s;h monarch was aver&s;e to engage again&s;t &s;o great an inequality: The French thought it &s;ufficient if he eluded the attacks of his enemy, without running any unnece&s;&s;ary hazard. The two armies faced one another for &s;ome days: Mutual defiances were &s;ent: And Edward, at la&s;t, retired backwards into Flanders, and di&s;per&s;ed his army<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 41, 42, 43.

<P>SUCH was the fruitle&s;s and almo&s;t ridiculous conclu&s;ion of all Edward's mighty preparations; and as his mea&s;ures were the mo&s;t prudent, that could be embraced in his &s;ituation, he might learn from experience in what a hopele&s;s enterprize he was engaged. His expences, tho' they had led to no end, had been con&s;uming and de&s;tructive: He had contracted near 300,000 pounds of debt<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Abridg. p. 17.</NOTE>; he had an|ticipated all his revenue; he had pawned every thing of value, which belonged either to him&s;elf or his queen; he was obliged in &s;ome measure even to pawn him&s;elf to his creditors, by de&s;iring their permi&s;&s;ion to go over to England, in order to procure &s;upply, and by promi&s;ing on his word of honour to return in per&s;on, if he did not remit them their money.</P>
<P>BUT he was a prince of too much &s;pirit to be di&s;couraged by the fir&s;t difficul|ties of an undertaking; and he was anxious to retrieve his honour by more &s;uc|ce&s;sful and more gallant enterprizes. For this purpo&s;e, he had, during the cour&s;e of the campaign, &s;ent orders to &s;ummon a parliament by his &s;on Edward, whom he had left with the title of guardian, and to demand of them &s;ome &s;upply in his urgent nece&s;&s;ities. The barons &s;eemed inclined to grant his reque&s;t; but the knights, who often, at this time, acted as a &s;eparate body from the burge&s;&s;es, made &s;ome &s;cruple of taxing their con&s;tituents, without a&s;king their con&s;ent; and they de&s;ired the guardian to &s;ummon a new parliament, who might be properly empowered for that purpo&s;e. The &s;ituation of the King and parliament was, for the time, nearly &s;imilar to that which they con&s;tantly fell into about the begin|ning of the la&s;t century; and &s;imilar con&s;equences began vi&s;ibly to appear. The King, &s;en&s;ible of the frequent demands which he would be obliged to make on his people, had been anxious to en&s;ure to his friends a &s;eat in the hou&s;e of commons,
<PB N="176" REF="182">
and at his in&s;tigation, the &s;heriffs and other placemen had made intere&s;t to be elected into that a&s;&s;embly; an abu&s;e which the knights de&s;ired the King to correct by the tenor of his writ of &s;ummons, and which was accordingly remedied. On the other hand, the knights profe&s;&s;edly annexed conditions to their intended grant, and required a con&s;iderable retrenchment of the royal prerogatives, particular|ly with regard to purveyance, and the levying the antient feudal aids for knighting the King's elde&s;t &s;on, and marrying his elde&s;t daughter. The new parliament, called by the Guardian, retained the &s;ame free &s;pirit; and tho' they offered a large &s;upply of 30,000 &s;acks of wool, no bu&s;ine&s;s was concluded; becau&s;e the conditions, which they annexed appeared too high to be compen&s;ated by a temporary conce&s;&s;ion. But when Edward him&s;elf came over to England, he &s;ummoned another parliament, and he had the intere&s;t to procure a &s;upply on more moderate terms. A confirmation of the two charters and of the privileges of boroughs, a pardon for old debts and tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, and a remedy for &s;ome abu&s;es in the execution of common law, were the chief conditions in&s;i&s;ted on; and the King in return for his conce&s;&s;ions on the&s;e heads, obtained from the barons and knights an unu&s;ual grant for two years of the ninth &s;heaf, lamb, and fieece on their e&s;tates, and from the burge&s;&s;es, a ninth of their moveables at their true value. The whole parliament al&s;o granted a duty of forty &s;hillings on each &s;ack of wool exported, on each three hundred wool-fells, and on each la&s;t of leather for the &s;ame term of years; but dreading the arbitrary &s;pirit of the crown, they expre&s;sly declared, that this grant was to continue no longer, and was not to be drawn into precedent. Being &s;oon after &s;en&s;ible, that this &s;upply, tho' con&s;iderable and very unu&s;ual in that age, would come in &s;lowly, and would not an&s;wer the King's urgent nece&s;&s;ities, both from his pa&s;t debts, and his preparations for war; they agreed, that 20,000 &s;acks of wool &s;hould immediately be granted him, and their value be deducted from the ninths, which were afterwards to be levied.</P>
<P>BUT there appeared, at this time, another jealou&s;y in the parliament, which was very rea&s;onable, and was founded on a &s;entiment that ought to have engaged them rather to check than &s;upport the King in all tho&s;e ambitious projects, &s;o little likely to prove &s;ucce&s;sful, and &s;o dangerous to the nation, if they did. Ed|ward, who, before the commencement of the former campaign, had, in &s;everal commi&s;&s;ions, a&s;&s;umed the title of King of France, now more openly, in all pub|lic deeds, gave him&s;elf that appellation, and always quartered the arms of France with tho&s;e of England in all his &s;eals and en&s;igns. The parliament thought pro|per to obviate the con&s;equences of this mea&s;ure, and to declare, that they owed him no obedience as King of France, and that the two kingdoms mu&s;t forever

remain di&s;tinct and independant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">14 Edward III.</NOTE>. They undoubtedly fore&s;aw, that France, if &s;ubdued, would in the end prove the &s;eat of government; and they deemed this previous prote&s;tation nece&s;&s;ary, in order to prevent their becoming a pro|vince under that monarchy. A very frail &s;ecurity, if the event had really taken place!</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1340" UNIT="year"> As Philip was apprized, from the preparations, which were making both in England and the low countries, that he mu&s;t expect another inva&s;ion from Ed|ward, he fitted out a great fleet of 400 ve&s;&s;els, manned with 40,000 men; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Naval victory 13th June.</NOTE> and he &s;tationed them off Slui&s;e, with a view of intercepting the King in his pa&s;&s;age. The Engli&s;h navy was much inferior in number, con&s;i&s;ting only of 240 &s;hips; but whether it was by the &s;uperior abilities of Edward, or the greater dexterity of his &s;eamen, they gained the wind of the enemy, and had the &s;un in their backs; and with the&s;e advantages began the action. The battle was fierce and bloody: The Engli&s;h archers, who&s;e force and addre&s;s, were now much cele|brated, galled the French on their approach: And when the &s;hips grappled to|gether, and the conte&s;t became more &s;teady and furious, the example of the King, and of &s;o many gallant nobles, who accompanied him, animated to &s;uch a degree the &s;eamen and &s;oldiery, that they maintained every where a &s;uperiority over the enemy. The French al&s;o had been guilty of &s;ome imprudence in &s;ta|tioning them&s;elves &s;o near the coa&s;t of Flanders, and choo&s;ing that place for the &s;cene of action. The Flemings, de&s;crying the battle, hurried out of their ports, and brought a re-inforcement to the Engli&s;h; which, coming unexpectedly, had a greater effect than in proportion to its power and numbers. Two hundred and thirty French &s;hips were taken: Thirty thou&s;and Frenchmen were killed, with two of their admirals: The lo&s;s of the Engli&s;h was incon&s;iderable, compared to the greatne&s;s and importance of the victory<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art. liv. 1. chap. 51.

<P>THE lu&s;tre of this great &s;ucce&s;s added to the King's authority among his allies, who a&s;&s;embled their forces with expedition, and joined the Engli&s;h army. Ed|ward marched to the frontiers of France at the head of 100,000 men, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of foreigners, a more numerous army than, either before or &s;ince, has ever been commanded by any King of England<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 5. p. 197.</NOTE>. At the &s;ame time, the Flem|ings, to the amount of 50,000 men, marched out under the command of Robert d'Artois, and laid &s;iege to St. Omer; but this tumultuous force, compo&s;ed en|tirely
<PB N="178" REF="184">
of trade&s;men, unexperienced in war, was routed by a &s;ally of the gar|ri&s;on, and notwith&s;tanding the abilities of their leader, was thrown into &s;uch a panic, that they were in&s;tantly di&s;per&s;ed, and never after appeared in the field. The e terprizes of Edward, tho' not attended with &s;o inglorious an i&s;&s;ue, proved equally vain and fruitle&s;s. The King of France had a&s;&s;embled an army more numerous than the Engli&s;h; was accompanied with all the chief nobility of his kingdom; was attended by many foreign princes, and even by three monarchs, the Kings of Bohemia, Scotland and Navarre<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap 57.</NOTE>: Yet he &s;till adhered to the pru|dent re&s;olution of putting nothing to hazard, and after throwing &s;trong garri&s;ons into all the frontier towns, he retired backwards, per&s;uaded, that the enemy, hav|ing wa&s;ted their force in &s;ome tedious and un&s;ucce&s;sful enterprize, would afford him an ea&s;y victory.</P>
<P>TOURNAY was at that time one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable cities of Flanders, containing above 60,000 inhabitants of all ages, who were affectionate to the French government; and as the &s;ecret of Edward's de&s;igns had not been &s;trictly kept, Philip learned, that the Engli&s;h, in order to gratify their Flemi&s;h allies, had intended to open the campaign with the &s;iege of this place: He took care therefore to &s;upply it with a garri&s;on of 14,000 men, commanded by the brave&s;t nobility of France; and he rea&s;onably expected, that the&s;e forces, joined to the inhabitants, would be able to defend the city again&s;t all the efforts of the enemy. Accordingly, Edward, when he commenced the &s;iege, about the end of July, found every where an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance: The valour of the one &s;ide was en|countered with equal valour by the other: Every a&s;&s;ault was repul&s;ed and proved un&s;ucce&s;sful: And the King was at la&s;t obliged to turn the &s;iege into a blockade, in hopes, that the great numbers of the garri&s;on and inhabitants, which had enabled them to defend them&s;elves again&s;t his attacks, would but expo&s;e them to be the more ea&s;ily reduced by famine<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap 54.</NOTE>. The count d'Eu, the governor, as &s;oon as he perceived that the Engli&s;h had formed this plan of operations, endea|voured to &s;pare his provi&s;ions, by expelling all the u&s;ele&s;s mouths; and the duke of Brabant, who wi&s;hed no &s;ucce&s;s to Edward's enterprize, gave every one a free pa&s;&s;age thro' his quarters.</P>
<P>AFTER the &s;iege had continued ten weeks, the city was reduced to di&s;tre&s;s; and Philip, recalling al his &s;cattered garri&s;ons, advanced at the head of a mighty army, within three leagues of the Engli&s;h camp, with in intention of &s;till avoid|ing any deci&s;ive action, but of &s;eeking &s;ome opportunity to throw relief into the place. Here, Edward, irritated with the &s;mall progre&s;s which he had hitherto made,
<PB N="179" REF="185">
and with the di&s;agreeable pro&s;pect that lay before him, &s;ent Philip a defiance by a herald; and challenged him to decide their claims for the crown of France, either by &s;ingle combat, or by an action of a hundred again&s;t a hundred, or by a general engage|ment. But Philip replied, that Edward having done homage to him for his dutchy of Guienne, and having &s;olemnly acknowledged his &s;uperiority, it by no means became him to &s;end a defiance to his liege lord and &s;overeign: That he was confident, notwith&s;tanding all his preparations, and his conjunction with the rebellious Flemings, to be able &s;oon to chace him from the frontiers of France: That as Ed|ward's ho&s;tilities had prevented him from executing his purpo&s;ed croi&s;ade again&s;t the infidels, he tru&s;ted in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Almighty, who would reward his pious intentions, and puni&s;h the aggre&s;&s;or, who&s;e ill grounded claims had rendered them ineffectual: That Edward propo&s;ed a duel on very unequal terms, and offered to hazard only his own per&s;on, again&s;t both the kingdom of France, and the per&s;on of the King: But that if he would encrea&s;e the &s;take, and put al&s;o the kingdom of England on the i&s;&s;ue of the duel, he would, notwith&s;tanding that the terms would &s;till be unequal, very willingly accept of his challenge<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Du Tillet, Recueil de Traitez, &amp;c. Heming. p. 325, 326. Wal&s;ing. p. 149.</NOTE>. It was ea&s;y to &s;ee that tho&s;e mutual bravadoes were intended only to dazle the popu|lace, and that the two kings were too wi&s;e to think of executing their pretended purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>WHILE the French and Engli&s;h armies lay in this &s;ituation, and a general ac|tion was every day expected, Jane counte&s;s dowager of Hainault interpo&s;ed with her good offices, and endeavoured to conciliate peace between the contending mo|narchs, and to prevent any farther effu&s;ion of blood. This prince&s;s was mother in-law to Edward, and &s;i&s;ter to Philip; and tho' &s;he had taken the vows in a con|vent, and had abandoned the world, &s;he left her retreat on this occa&s;ion, and employed all her pious efforts to allay tho&s;e animo&s;ities, which had taken place between per&s;ons &s;o nearly related to her, and to each other. As Philip had no ma|terial claims upon his antagoni&s;t, &s;he found him to hearken very willingly to the propo&s;als; and even the haughty and ambitious mind of Edward, convinced of his fruitle&s;s attempt, was not aver&s;e to her negociation. He was &s;en&s;ible from experience, that he had engaged in an enterprize which far exceeded his force; and that the power of England was never likely to prevail over that of a &s;uperior kingdom, firmly united under an able and prudent monarch. He di&s;covered, that all the allies, whom he could gain by negotiation, were at bottom aver&s;e to his enter|prize; and tho' they might &s;econd it to a certain length, would immediately detach them&s;elves, and oppo&s;e its final accompli&s;hment, if ever they could be brought to

think that there was &s;eriou&s;ly any danger of it. He even &s;aw, that their chief purpo&s;e was to obtain money from him; and as his &s;upplies from England came in very &s;lowly, and had much di&s;appointed his expectations, he was convinced of their growing indifference in his cau&s;e, and of their zeal to embrace all plau&s;ible terms of accommodation. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> Convinced at la&s;t, that an undertaking mu&s;t be im|prudent, which could only be &s;upported by means &s;o unequal to the end, he con|cluded a truce, which left both parties in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their pre&s;ent acqui&s;itions, and &s;topped all farther ho&s;tilities on the &s;ide of the low countries, Guienne and Scotland, till Mid&s;ummer next<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, iv. 1. chap. 64. Ave&s;bury, p. 65.</NOTE>. A negotiation was &s;oon after opened at Arras, under the mediation of the Pope's legates, and the truce was attempted to be converted into a &s;olid peace. Edward here required that Philip &s;hould free Gui|enne from all claims of &s;uperiority, and entirely abandon the protection of Scot|land: But as he &s;eemed not any wi&s;e entitled to make &s;uch exorbitant demands, from either his pa&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;es, or future pro&s;pects, they were totally rejected by Phi|lip, who agreed only to a prolongation of the truce.</P>
<P>THE King of France &s;oon after detached the emperor Lewis from the alliance of England, and engaged him to revoke the title of imperial vicar, which he had conferred on Edward<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heming p. 352. Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 514. Knygton, p. 2580.</NOTE>. The King's other allies on the frontiers of France, di&s;appointed in their hopes, gradually withdrew from the confederacy. And Ed|ward him&s;elf, harra&s;&s;ed by his numerous and impatient creditors, was obliged to make his e&s;cape by &s;tealth into England.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> THE unu&s;ual impo&s;ition of a ninth &s;heaf, lamb and fleece, laid on by the par|liament, together with the great want of money, and &s;till more, of credit in Eng|land, had rendered the remittances to Flanders &s;o backward; nor could it be ex|pected, that any expeditious methods of collecting a tax, which was &s;o new in it&s;elf, and which yielded only a gradual produce, could po&s;&s;ibly be contrived by the King or his mini&s;ters. And tho' the parliament, fore&s;eeing the inconvenience, had granted, as a pre&s;ent re&s;ource, 20,000 &s;acks of wool, the only Engli&s;h goods which bore a certain price in foreign markets, and were the next to ready money; it was impo&s;&s;ible, but the &s;eizing of &s;uch a bulky commodity, the gathering of it from different parts of the kingdom, and the di&s;po&s;ing of it abroad, mu&s;t take up much more time than the urgency of the King's aff irs would permit, and occa&s;ion all the di&s;appointments complained of, during the cour&s;e of the campaign. But tho' nothing had happened, which Edward might not rea&s;onably have fore&s;een, he was &s;o irritated with the unfortunate i&s;&s;ue of his military operations, and &s;o much

vexed and affronted by his foreign creditors, that he was determined to throw the blame &s;omewhere off him&s;elf, and he came in very bad humour into Eng|land. He di&s;covered his pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition by the fir&s;t act which he performed after his arrival: As he landed unexpectedly, he found the Tower &s;omewhat un|guarded; and he immediately committed to pri&s;on the con&s;table and all others who had the charge of that fortre&s;s; and he treated them with unu&s;ual rigour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ypod, Neu&s;t. p. 513.</NOTE>. His vengeance fell next on the officers of the revenue, the &s;heriffs, the collectors of taxes, the undertakers of all kinds; and be&s;ides turning all of them out of their offices, he appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to enquire into their conduct; and the&s;e men, in order to gratify the King's humour, were &s;ure not to find any per&s;on in|nocent, who came before them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ave&s;bury, p. 70.

<P>THERE were &s;trong rea&s;ons, which might di&s;courage the Kings of England, in tho&s;e ages, from be&s;towing the chief offices of the crown on prelates and other eccle&s;ia&s;tical per&s;ons. The&s;e men had &s;o entrenched them&s;elves in privileges and immunities, and pretended &s;o openly to be exempt from all &s;ecular juri&s;diction, that no civil penalty could be inflicted on them for any malver&s;ation in office; and as even trea&s;on it&s;elf was declared to be no canonical offence, nor was allow|ed to be a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for deprivation or other &s;piritual cen&s;ures, that order of men had en&s;ured to them&s;elves almo&s;t a total impunity, and were not bound by any political laws or &s;tatutes. But, on the other hand, there were many pecu|liar cau&s;es which favoured their promotion. De&s;ides that they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed almo&s;t all the learning of the age, and were be&s;t qualified for civil employments; the prelates enjoyed equal dignity with the greate&s;t barons, and gave weight, by their per&s;onal authority, to the powers entru&s;ted with them: While, at the &s;ame time, they endangered not the crown by accumulating wealth or influence in their fa|milies, and were re&s;trained, by the decency of their character, from that open rapine and violence, &s;o often practi&s;ed by the nobles. The&s;e motives had induc|ed Edward, as well as many of his predece&s;&s;ors, to entru&s;t the chief parts of his government in the hands of eccle&s;ia&s;tics; at the hazard of &s;eeing them di&s;own his authority &s;o &s;oon as it was turned again&s;t them.</P>

The clergy, with the primate at their head, were now formed into a regular combination again&s;t the King; and many calumnies were &s;pread again&s;t him, in order to deprive him of the confidence and affections of his pe ple; that he intended to recal the ge|neral pardon, and the remi&s;&s;ion of old debts which he had granted, and to im|po&s;e new and arbitrary taxes without con&s;ent of parliament. The archbi&s;hop went &s;o far, in a letter to the King him&s;elf, as to tell him, that there were two powers, by which the world was governed, the holy pontifical apo&s;tolic digni|ty, and the royal &s;ubordinate authority: That of the&s;e two powers, the clerical was evidently the &s;upreme, &s;ince the prie&s;ts were to an&s;wer, at the tribunal of the divine judgment, for the conduct of kings them&s;elves: That the clergy were the &s;piritual fathers of all the faithful, and among&s;t others of kings and princes; and were intitled, by a heavenly charter, to direct their wills and actions, and to cen&s;ure their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions: And that prelates had heretofore cited emperors be|fore their tribunal, had tried their life and behaviour, and had anathematized them for their ob&s;tinate offences<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Anglia Sacra, vol. 1. p. 27.</NOTE>. The&s;e topics were not well calculated to ap|pea&s;e Edward's indignation; and when he called a parliament, he &s;ent not to the primate, as to the other peers, a &s;ummons to appear in it. Stratford was not di&s;|couraged with this mark of neglect or anger: He appeared before the gates, ar|rayed in his pontifical robes, holding the cro&s;ier in his hand, and attended with a pompous train of prie&s;ts and prelates; and he required admittance to his &s;eat as the fir&s;t and highe&s;t peer of the realm. For two days, the King denied him entrance: But either &s;en&s;ible, that this affair might be attended with dangerous con&s;equences, or that in his impatience he had groundle&s;sly accu&s;ed the primate

<P>EDWARD now found him&s;elf in a very bad &s;ituation both with his own people and with foreign &s;tates; and it required all his genius and capacity to extricate him&s;elf from &s;uch multiplied difficulties and embarra&s;&s;ments. His unju&s;t and ex|orbitant claims on France and Scotland had engaged him in an implacable war with the&s;e two kingdoms, his neare&s;t neighbours: He had lo&s;t almo&s;t all his fo|reign alliances by his irregular payments: He was deeply involved in debts, for which he owed a con&s;uming intere&s;t: His military operations had vani&s;hed into &s;moke; and except his naval victory, none of them had been attended even with glory or renown, either to him&s;elf or to the nation: The animo&s;ity between him and the clergy was open and declared: The people were di&s;contented on account of many arbitrary mea&s;ures, in which he had been engaged: And what was more dangerous, the nobility, taking advantage of his pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ities, were deter|mined to retrench his power, and by encroaching on the antient prerogatives of the crown, to require to them&s;elves independance and authority. But the a&s;pir|ing g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> of Edward, which had &s;o far tran&s;ported him beyond the bounds of di&s;cretion, proved at la&s;t &s;ufficient to re-in&s;tate him in his former authority, and finally to render his reign the mo&s;t triumphant which is to be met with in En|gli&s;h &s;tory: Tho' for the pre&s;ent he was obliged, with &s;ome lo&s;s of honour, to yield to the current, which bore &s;o &s;trongly again&s;t him.</P>
<P>THE parliament framed an act, which was likely to produce con&s;iderable inno|vations in the government. They premi&s;ed, that, whereas the great charter had, to the manife&s;t peril and &s;lander of the King and damage of his people, been violated in many points, particularly by the impri&s;onment of free men and the &s;eizure of their goods, without &s;uit, indictment or trial, it was nece&s;&s;ary to con|firm it anew, and to oblige all the chief officers of the law, together with the &s;teward and chamberlain of the hou&s;hold, the keeper of the privy &s;eal, the con|troller and trea&s;urer of the wardrobe, and tho&s;e who were entru&s;ted with the education of the young prince, to &s;wear to the regular ob&s;ervance of it. They al&s;o remarked, that the peers of the realm had formerly been arre&s;ted and impri&s;oned, and di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their temporalities and lands, and even &s;ome of them put to death, without judgment of their peers; and they therefore enacted that &s;uch violences &s;hould henceforth cea&s;e, and no peer be puni&s;hed but by the award of his peers <HI>in parliament.</HI> They required, that, whenever any of the great offices abovementioned &s;hould become vacant, the King &s;hould fill it by the advice of
<PB N="184" REF="190">
his council, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> the con&s;ent of other great men, who &s;hould at that time be found to re&s;ide in the neighbourhood of the court. And they enacted, that on the third day of every &s;e&s;&s;ion, the King &s;hould re&s;ume into his own hands all the&s;e offices, except tho&s;e of ju&s;tices of the two benches and the barons of exchequer; that the&s;e mini&s;ters &s;hould for the time be reduced to private per&s;ons; that they &s;hould in that condition an&s;wer before the parliament to any accu&s;ations brought again&s;t them; and that, if they were found any wi&s;e guilty, they &s;hould finally be di&s;po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of their offices, and more &s;ufficient per&s;ons be &s;ub&s;tituted in their place<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">15 Edw III.</NOTE>. By the&s;e la&s;t regulations, the barons approached as near as they dared to tho&s;e re|&s;trictions, which had formerly been impo&s;ed on Henry III. and Edward II. and which, from the dangerous con&s;equences attending them, had become &s;o gene|rally odious, that they neither expected to have the concurrence of the people in demanding them, nor the a&s;&s;ent of the pre&s;ent King in granting them.</P>
<P>IN return for the&s;e important conce&s;&s;ions, the parliament profered the King a grant of 20,000 &s;acks of wool; and his wants were &s;o urgent from the clamours of his creditors, and the demands of his foreign allies, that he was obliged to accept of the &s;upply on the&s;e hard conditions. He ratified this &s;tatute in full parliament; but he <HI>&s;ecretly</HI> entered a prote&s;t of &s;uch a nature as was &s;ufficient, one &s;hould imagine, to de&s;troy for the future all tru&s;t and confidence with his people: He declared, that, &s;o &s;oon as his convenience permitted, he would, from his own authority, revoke what had been extorted from him<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Statutes at large: 15 Edw.

That this prote&s;t of the King's was <HI>&s;e|c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">et</HI> appears evidently, &s;ince otherwi&s;e it would have been ridiculous in the parliament to have accept|ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> Be&s;ides the King owns that he <HI>di&s;&s;embled,</HI> which would not have been the ca&s;e, had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">.</NOTE>. Accordingly, he was no &s;ooner po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the parliamentary &s;upply, than he i&s;&s;ued an edict, which contains many extraordinary po&s;itions and preten&s;ions. He fir&s;t a&s;&s;erts, that that &s;tatute had been enacted contrary to the law; as if a free legi&s;lative body could ever do any thing illegal. He next affirms, that, as it was hurtful to the prerogatives of the crown which he was &s;worn to defend, he had only di&s;&s;embled, when he &s;eemed to ratify it, but that he had never in his own brea&s;t given his a&s;&s;ent to it. He does not pretend, that either he or the parliament lay under any force; but only that &s;ome inconvenience would have en&s;ued had he not &s;eeming|ly given his a&s;&s;ent to that pretended &s;tatute. He therefore, with the advice of his council and of &s;ome earls and barons, abrogates and annulls it; and tho' he profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf willing and determined to ob&s;erve &s;uch articles of it as were formerly law, he declares it to have thenceforth no force or authority<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Statutes at large, 15 Edw.

of royal power, which by a parity of rea&s;on left all their laws at the mercy of the King; and during the cour&s;e of two years, Edward had &s;o far re-e&s;tab|li&s;hed his influence, and freed him&s;elf from his pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ities, that he then obtained from his parliament a legal repeal of the obnoxious &s;tatute<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Abridgm. p. 38, 39.</NOTE>.

<P>BUT tho' Edward had happily recovered his authority at home, which had been impaired by the events of the French war, he had undergone &s;o many mor|tifications from that attempt, and &s;aw &s;o little pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, that he would probably have dropt his claim, had not a revolution in Brittany opened to him more promi&s;ing views, and given his enterprizing genius a full opportunity of di&s;playing it&s;elf.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Brittany.</NOTE> JOHN III. duke of Brittany, had &s;ome years before his death, found him&s;elf declining thro' age and infirmities; and having no i&s;&s;ue, he was &s;olicitous to pre|vent tho&s;e di&s;orders, to which, on the event of his decea&s;e, a di&s;puted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion might expo&s;e his &s;ubjects. His younger brother, the count de Penthievre, had left only one daughter, whom the duke deemed his heir; and as his family had inherited the dutchy by a female &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, he thought her title preferable to that of the count de Mountfort, who, being his brother by a &s;econd marriage, was the male heir of that principality<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 64.</NOTE>. He accordingly propo&s;ed to be&s;tow her in marriage on &s;ome per&s;on, who might be able to defend her rights; and he ca&s;t his eye on Charles de Blois, nephew of the King of France, by his mother, Margaret de Valois, &s;i&s;ter to that monarch. But as he both loved his &s;ubjects and was belov|ed by them, he determined not to take this important &s;tep without their appro|bation; and having a&s;&s;embled the &s;tates of Brittany, he repre&s;ented to them the advantages of that alliance, and the pro&s;pect, which it gave, of an entire &s;ettle|ment of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The Bretons willingly concurred in his choice: The mar|riage was concluded: All his va&s;&s;als, and among the re&s;t, the count de Mount|fort, &s;wore fealty to Charles and to his &s;pou&s;e as to their future &s;overeigns: And every danger of civil commotions &s;eemed to be obviated, as far as human pru|dence could provide a remedy again&s;t them.</P>
<P>BUT on the death of this good prince, the ambition of the count de Mountfort broke thro' all the&s;e regulations, and kindled a war, not only dangerous to Brit|tany, but to a great part of Europe. While Charles de Blois was &s;olliciting at
<PB N="186" REF="192">
the court of France the inve&s;titure of the dutchy, Mountfort was active in ac|quiring immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and by force or intrigue he made him&s;elf ma&s;|ter of Rennes, Nantz, Bre&s;t, Hennebonne, and all the mo&s;t important for|tre&s;&s;es, and engaged many con&s;iderable barons to acknowledge his authority<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, 66, 67, 68.</NOTE>. Sen&s;ible, that he could expect no favour from Philip, he made a voyage to Eng|land, on pretence of &s;olliciting his claim to the earldom of Richmond, which had devolved to him by his brother's death; and offering to do homage to Edward, as King of France, for the dutchy of Brittany, he propo&s;ed a &s;trict alliance for the &s;upport of each other's preten&s;ions. Edward &s;aw immediately the advantages at|tending this treaty: Mountfort, an active and valiant prince, clo&s;ely united to him by intere&s;t, opened at once an entrance into the heart of France, and afford|ed him much more flattering views, than his allies on the &s;ide of Germany and the Low Countries, who had no &s;incere attachment to his cau&s;e, and who&s;e pro|gre&s;s was al&s;o ob&s;tructed by tho&s;e numerous fortifications, which had been rai&s;ed on that frontier.

<P>AS this treaty was &s;till a &s;ecret, Mountfort, on his return, ventured to appear at Paris, in order to defend his cau&s;e before the court of peers; but ob&s;erving Philip and his judges to be prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed again&s;t his title, and dreading their intentions of arre&s;ting him, till he &s;hould re&s;tore what he had &s;eized by violence, he &s;uddenly made his e&s;cape; and war immediately broke out between him and Charles de Blois<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE>.

<P><MILESTONE UNIT="year"> THIS event &s;eemed to put an end to the preten&s;ions of the count de Mountfort; but his affairs were immediately retrieved by an unexpected incident, which in&s;pired new life and vigour into his party. Jane of Flanders, counte&s;s of Mountfort, the

No &s;ooner did &s;he receive the fatal intelligence, than &s;he a&s;&s;embled the inhabitants of Rennes, where &s;he then re&s;ided; and carrying her infant &s;on in her arms, de|plored to them the calamity of their &s;overeign, and recommended to their care the illu&s;trious orphan, the &s;ole male remaining of their antient princes, who had governed them with &s;uch indulgence and lenity, and to whom they had ever pro|fe&s;&s;ed &s;uch a zealous attachment: She declared her&s;elf willing to run all hazards with them in &s;o ju&s;t a cau&s;e; di&s;covered the re&s;ources which &s;till remained in the alliance of England; and entreated them to make one effort again&s;t an u&s;urper, who, being impo&s;ed on them by the arms of France, would in return make a &s;acrifice to his protector of the antient liberties
of Brittany. The audience, mov|ed by the affecting appearance, and in&s;pirited by the noble conduct of the prin|ce&s;s, vowed to live and die with her in defending the rights of her family: All the other fortre&s;&s;es of Brittany embraced the &s;ame re&s;olution: The counte&s;s went from place to place, encouraging the garri&s;ons, providing them with every nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, concerting their plans of defence; and after &s;he had put the whole province in a proper po&s;ture, &s;he &s;hut her&s;elf up in Hennebonne, where &s;he waited with impatience the arrival of tho&s;e &s;uccours, which Edward had promi&s;ed her.

The defence was no le&s;s vigorous: The be&s;iegers were repul&s;ed in every a&s;&s;ault: Frequent &s;allies were made with &s;ucce&s;s by the garri&s;on: And the counte&s;s her&s;elf being the mo&s;t forward in all military operations, every one was a&s;hamed not to do his duty to the utmo&s;t in this de&s;perate &s;ituation. One day &s;he perceived, that the be&s;iegers, entirely employed in an attack, had neglected a di&s;tant quarter of their camp; and &s;he immediately &s;allied forth at the head of a body of 200 cavalry, threw them into confu&s;ion, committed great &s;laughter upon them, and &s;et fire to their tents, baggage and magazines: But when &s;he was about to return, &s;he found that &s;he was intercepted, and that a great body of the

She met them at the appointed place of rendezvous, collect|ed another body of 500 hor&s;e, returned to Hennebonne, broke unexpectedly thro' the enemies camp, and was received with &s;houts and acclamations by the gar|ri&s;on, who, encouraged by this reinforcement, and by &s;o rare an example of fe|male valour, determined to defend them&s;elves to the la&s;t extremity.</P>
<P>THE reiterated attacks, however, of the be&s;iegers, had at length made &s;everal breache, in the walls; and it was apprehended, that a general a&s;&s;ault, which was every hour expected, would overpower the garri&s;on, dimini&s;hed in their numbers, and extremely weakened with watching and fatigue. It became nece&s;&s;ary to treat of a capitulation; and the bi&s;hop of Leon was already engaged, for that purpo&s;e, in a conference with Charles de Blois, when the counte&s;s, who had mounted on a high tower, and was looking towards the &s;ea with great impati|ence, de&s;cried &s;ome &s;ails at a di&s;tance.

This fleet carried a body of Engli&s;h gen&s;darmes, and &s;ix thou&s;and archers, whom Edward had prepared for the relief of Hennebonne, but who had been long detained by contrary winds.

<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding this &s;ucce&s;s, the counte&s;s of Mountfort found that her party, overpowered by &s;uperior numbers, were declining in every quarter; and &s;he went over to &s;ollicit more effectual &s;uccours from the King of England. Ed|ward granted her a con&s;iderable reinforcement under Robert d'Artois; who em|barked his troops on board a fleet of forty five &s;hips and &s;ailed to Brittany.

AFTER the death of this unfortunate prince, the chief author of all the ca|lamities, with which his country was overwhelmed for above a century, Ed|ward undertook in per&s;on the defence of the counte&s;s of Mountfort; and as the la&s;t truce with France was now expired, the war, which the Engli&s;h and French had hitherto carried on as allies to the competitors for Brittany, is thenceforth conducted in the name and under the &s;tandard of the two monarchs. The King landed at Morbian near Vannes, with an army of 12,000 men; and being ma&s;|ter of the field, where no enemy dared to appear again&s;t him, he endeavoured to give a lu&s;tre to his arms, by commencing at once three important &s;ieges, that of Vannes, of Rennes, and of Nantz. But by undertaking too much, he failed of &s;ucce&s;s in all his enterprizes. Even the &s;iege of Vannes, which Edward in per&s;on conducted with vigour, advanced but &s;lowly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 95.</NOTE>; and the French had all the lei&s;ure requi&s;ite for making preparations again&s;t him. The duke of Nor|mandy, elde&s;t &s;on of Philip, appeared in Brittany at the head of an army of 30,000 infantry and 4000 cavalry; and Edward was now obliged to draw together all his forces, and to entrench him&s;elf &s;trongly before Vannes, where the duke of Normandy &s;oon after arrived, and in a manner inve&s;ted the be&s;iegers. The garri&s;on and the French camp were plentifully &s;upplied with provi&s;ions; while the Engli&s;h, who dared to make no attempt upon the place in the pre&s;ence of a &s;uperior army, drew all their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance from England, expo&s;ed to the hazards of the &s;ea, and &s;ometimes to tho&s;e ari&s;ing from the fleet of the enemy. <MILESTONE N="1343" UNIT="year"> In this dangerous &s;ituation, Edward very willingly hearkened to the mediation of the Pope's legates, the cardinals of Pale&s;trine and Fre&s;cati, who endeavoured to ne|gotiate, if not a peace, at lea&s;t a truce between the two kingdoms.

It was agreed, that Vannes &s;hould be &s;eque&s;tered, during the truce, in the hands of the legates, to be di&s;po&s;ed of afterwards as they plea&s;ed; and tho' Edward knew the partiality of the court of Rome to|wards his antagoni&s;t, he &s;aved him&s;elf by this devi&s;e from the di&s;honour of hav|ing undertaken a fruitle&s;s enterprize.

THE truce, tho' calculated for a long time, was of very &s;hort duration; and each monarch endeavoured to throw on the other the blame of its infraction. Of cour&s;e, the hi&s;torians of the two countries differ in their account of the matter. It &s;eems probable, however, as is affirmed by the French writers, that Edward, in con&s;enting to the truce, had no other purpo&s;e than to extricate him&s;elf from a perilous &s;ituation, into which he had fallen, and was afterwards very carele&s;s of its ob&s;ervance. In all the memorials which remain on this &s;ubject, he complains chiefly of the puni&s;hment inflicted on Oliver de Cli&s;&s;on, Henry de Leon, and other Breton noblemen, who, he &s;ays, were partizans of the family of Mountfort, and con&s;e|quently under the protection of England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 5. p. 453, 454, 459, 466, 496. Heming. p. 376.</NOTE>. But it appears from the hi&s;tory, that at the conclu&s;ion of the truce, tho&s;e noblemen had openly, by their declarations and actions, embraced the cau&s;e of Charles de Blois<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 96. p. 100.</NOTE>; and if they had entered into any &s;ecret corre&s;pondence and engagements with Edward, they were traitors to their party, and were ju&s;tly puni&s;hable by Philip and Charles, for their breach of faith; nor had Edward any ju&s;t ground of complaint again&s;t France for &s;uch &s;everities. <MILESTONE N="1344" UNIT="year"> But when he laid the&s;e pretended injuries before the parliament, whom he affected to con&s;ult on all occa&s;ions, that a&s;&s;embly entered into the quarrel, ad|vi&s;ed the King not to be amu&s;ed by a fraudulent truce, and granted him &s;upplies for the renewal of the war: The counties were charged with a fifteenth for two years, and the boroughs with a tenth. The clergy con&s;ented to give a tenth for three years.</P>
<P>THESE &s;upplies enabled the King to complete his military preparations; and he &s;ent his cou&s;in, Henry earl of Derby, &s;on of the earl of Lanca&s;ter, into Gui|enne, for the defence of that province<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 103.

<P><MILESTONE N="1346" UNIT="year"> THE rea&s;on why Derby was permitted without oppo&s;ition to make &s;uch pro|gre&s;s on the &s;ide of Guienne, was the difficulties under which the French finances then laboured, and which had obliged Philip to lay on new impo&s;itions, particu|larly the duty on &s;alt, to the great di&s;content, and almo&s;t mutiny of his &s;ubjects. But after the court of France was &s;upplied with money, great preparations were made; and the duke of Normandy, attended by the duke of Burgundy, and other great nobility, led towards Guienne a powerful army, which the Engli&s;h could not think of re&s;i&s;ting in the open field. The earl of Derby &s;tood on the defen&s;ive, and allowed the French to carry on at lei&s;ure the &s;iege of Angouleme, which was their fir&s;t enterprize. John lord Norwich, the governor, after a brave and vigorous defence, found him&s;elf reduced to extremities; and he was obliged to employ a &s;tratagem, in order to &s;ave his garri&s;on, and to prevent his being re|duced to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion. He appeared on the walls, and de&s;ired to &s;peak with the duke of Normandy. The prince, when he came, told Norwich, that he &s;uppo&s;ed he intended to capitulate. <Q REND="inline">"Not at all,"</Q> replied the governor: <Q REND="inline">"But as to-morrow is the fea&s;t of the Virgin, to whom, I know, that you, &s;ir, as well as my&s;elf, bear a great devotion, I de&s;ire a ce&s;&s;ation of arms for that day."</Q> The propo&s;als were agreed to; and Norwich, having ordered his forces to prepare all their baggage, marched out, and advanced towards the French camp. The be&s;iegers, imagining they were to be attacked, ran to their arms; but Norwich &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to the duke, reminding him of his engagement.

<P>EDWARD, informed by the earl of Derby of the great danger, to which Gui|enne was expo&s;ed, had prepared a fleet and army, with which he intended in per|&s;on to bring it relief. He embarked at Southampton on board a fleet of near a thou&s;and &s;ail of all dimen&s;ions; and carried with him, be&s;ides all the chief no|bility of England, his elde&s;t &s;on the prince of Wales, now fifteen years of age. The winds proved long contrary<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ave&s;bury, p. 123.</NOTE>; and the King, in de&s;pair of arriving in time at Guienne, was at la&s;t per&s;uaded by Geoffrey d'Harcourt, to change the de&s;ti|nation of his enterprize. This nobleman was a Norman by birth, had long made a con&s;iderable figure in the court of France, and was generally e&s;teemed for his per&s;onal merit and valour; but being di&s;obliged and per&s;ecuted by Philip, he had fled over to England; had recommended him&s;elf to Edward, who was an excellent judge of men; and had &s;ucceeded to Robert d'Artois in the invi|dious office of exciting and a&s;&s;i&s;ting the King in every enterprize again&s;t his na|tive country. He had long in&s;i&s;ted, that an expedition to Normandy promi&s;ed, in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, much more favourable &s;ucce&s;s, than one to Guienne; that Edward would find the northern provinces much unfurni&s;hed of military force, which had been drawn to the &s;outh; that they were full of flouri&s;hing ci|ties, who&s;e plunder would enrich the Engli&s;h; that their cultivated fields, as yet un&s;poiled by war, would &s;upply them with plenty of provi&s;ions; and that the neighbourhood of the capital rendered every event of importance in tho&s;e quar|ters<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 121.</NOTE>. The&s;e rea&s;ons, which had not before been duly weighed by Edward, be|gan to make more impre&s;&s;ion after the di&s;appointments, which he had met with in his voyage to Guienne: <NOTE PLACE="marg">12th July. Inva&s;ion of France.</NOTE> He ordered his fleet to &s;ail to Normandy, and &s;afely di&s;|embarked his army at la Hogue.</P>
<P>THIS army, which was, during the cour&s;e of the en&s;uing campaign, crowned with the mo&s;t &s;plendid &s;ucce&s;s, that ever attended the enterprize of any Engli&s;h monarch, con&s;i&s;ted of four thou&s;and men at arms, ten thou&s;and archers, ten thou&s;and Wel&s;h infantry, and &s;ix thou&s;and Iri&s;h. The Wel&s;h and the Iri&s;h were light, di&s;orderly troops, fitter for doing execution in a pur&s;uit, or &s;couring the country, than for any &s;table action. The bow was always e&s;teemed a frivolous wea|pon,
<PB N="193" REF="199">
where true military di&s;cipline was known, and regular bodies of well armed foot maintained. The only &s;olid force in this army were the men at arms, and even the&s;e, being cavalry, were, on that account, much inferior, in the &s;hock of battle, to good infantry: And as the whole were new levied troops, we are led to entertain a very mean idea of the military force of tho&s;e ages, which, be|ing ignorant in every other art, had not properly cultivated the art of war it&s;elf, the &s;ole object of their attention.</P>
<P>THE King created the earl of Arundel con&s;table of his army and the earls of Warwic and Harcourt, mare&s;chals: He be&s;towed the honour of knighthood on the prince of Wales, and &s;everal of the young nobility, immediately upon his landing. After de&s;troying all the &s;hips in la Hogue, Barfleur, and Cherbourg, he &s;pread his army over the whole country, and gave them an unbounded licence of burning, &s;poiling, and plundering every place, of which they became ma&s;ters. The loo&s;e di&s;cipline then practi&s;ed, could not be much hurt by the&s;e di&s;orderly practices; and Edward took care to prevent any &s;urprize, by giving orders to his troops, however they might di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves in the day time, always to quarter them&s;elves at night near the main body. In this manner, Montebourg, Carentan, St. Lo, Valognes, and other places in the Cotentin were pillaged without re&s;i&s;t|ance; and an univer&s;al con&s;ternation was &s;pread over the whole province<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE intelligence of this unexpected inva&s;ion &s;oon reached Paris; and threw Philip into great perplexity. He i&s;&s;ued orders, however, for levying forces in all quarters, and di&s;patched the count d'Eu, con&s;table of France, and the count de Tancarville, with a body of troops, to the defence of Caen, a populous and commercial but open city, which lay in the neighbourhood of the Engli&s;h army. The temptation of &s;o rich a prize, &s;oon allured Edward to approach it; and the inhabitants, encouraged by their numbers, and by the re-inforcements which they daily received from the country, ventured, again&s;t the advice of the con&s;table, to meet him in the field. But their courage failed them on the fir&s;t &s;hock: They fled with precipitation: The counts d'Eu and Tancarville were taken pri&s;oners: The victors entered the city along with the vanqui&s;hed, and a furious ma&s;&s;acre commenced, without di&s;tinction of age, &s;ex, or condition. The citizens, in de|&s;pair, barricaded their hou&s;es, and a&s;&s;aulted the Engli&s;h with &s;tones, bricks, and every mi&s;&s;ile weapon: The Engli&s;h made way by fire to the de&s;truction of the citizens: Till Edward, anxious to &s;ave both his &s;poil and his &s;oldiers, &s;topped the ma&s;&s;acre; and having obliged the inhabitants to lay down their arms, gave his troops licence to begin a more regular and le&s;s hazardous plunder of the city. The pillage continued for three days: The King re&s;erved for his own &s;hare the

jewels, plate, &s;ilks, fine cloth, and fine linen; and he be&s;towed all the remain|der of the &s;poil on his army. The whole was embarked on board the &s;hips, and &s;ent over to England; together with three hundred of the riche&s;t citizens of Caen, who&s;e ran&s;om was an additional profit, which he expected afterwards to levy'<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE>. This di&s;mal &s;cene pa&s;&s;ed in the pre&s;ence of two cardinal legates, who had come to negociate a peace between the kingdoms.</P>
<P>THE King moved next to Rouen in hopes of treating that city in the &s;ame man|ner; but found, that the bridge was already broken down, and that the King of France him&s;elf was arrived there with his army. He marched along the banks of the Seine towards Paris, de&s;troying the whole country, and every town and village, which he met with on his road<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 125.</NOTE>. Some of his light troops carried their ravages even to the gates of Paris; and the royal palace of St. Germans, together with Nan|terre, Ruelle, and other villages, was reduced to a&s;hes within &s;ight of that capi|tal. The Engli&s;h propo&s;ed to pa&s;s the river at Poi&s;&s;y, but found the French army encamped on the oppo&s;ite banks, and the bridge at that place, as well as all others upon the Seine, broken down by orders from Philip. Edward now &s;aw, that the French intended to enclo&s;e him in their country, in hopes of attacking him with advantage on all &s;ides: But he &s;aved him&s;elf by a &s;tratagem from this perilous &s;ituation. He gave his army orders to di&s;lodge, and to advance farther up the seine; but immediately returning by the &s;ame route, arrived at Poi&s;&s;y, which the enemy had already quitted, in order to attend his motions. He re|paired the bridge with incredible celerity, pa&s;&s;ed over his army, and having thus di&s;engaged him&s;elf from the enemy, advanced by quick marches towards Flanders. His vanguard, commanded by Harcourt, met with the town&s;men of Amiens, who were ha&s;tening to reinforce their King, and defeated them with great &s;laughter<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 125.</NOTE>. He pa&s;&s;ed by Beauvais, and burned the &s;uburbs of that city: But as he approached the Somme, he found him&s;elf in the &s;ame difficulty as before: All the bridges on that river were either broken down, or &s;trongly guarded: An army, under the command of Godemar de Faye, was &s;tationed on the oppo&s;ite banks: Philip was advanc|ing on him from the other quarter, with an army of an hundred thou&s;and men: And he was thus expo&s;ed to the danger of being enclo&s;ed, and of &s;tarving in an enemy's country. In this extremity, he publi&s;hed a reward to any one, that could bring him intelligence of a pa&s;&s;age over the Somme. A pea&s;ant, called Gobin Agace, who&s;e rame has been pre&s;erved by the &s;hare which he had in the&s;e impor|tant tran&s;actions, was tempted on this occa&s;ion to betray the intere&s;ts of his country; and he informed Edward of a ford below Abbeville, which had a
<PB N="195" REF="201">
&s;ound bottom, and might be pa&s;&s;ed without difficulty at low water<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 126, 127.</NOTE>. The King ha&s;tened thither, but found Godemar de Faye on the oppo&s;ite banks. Being urged by nece&s;&s;ity, he deliberated not a moment; but threw him&s;elf into the river, &s;word in hand, at the head of his troops; drove the enemy from their &s;tation; and pur&s;ued them to a di&s;tance on the plain<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 127.</NOTE>. The French army under Philip, arrived at the ford, when the rear guard of the Engli&s;h were pa&s;&s;ing. So narrow was the e&s;cape, which Edward, by his prudence and celerity, made from this danger! The ri&s;ing of the tide prevented the French King from following him over the ford, and obliged that prince to take his road over the bridge at Abbe|ville; by which &s;ome time was lo&s;t.</P>
<P>IT is natural to think, that Philip, at the head of &s;o va&s;t an army, was impa|tient to take revenge of the Engli&s;h, and to prevent the di&s;grace to which he mu&s;t be expo&s;ed, if an inferior enemy &s;hould be allowed, after ravaging &s;o great a part of his kingdom, to e&s;cape with impunity. Edward al&s;o was &s;en&s;ible, that &s;uch mu&s;t be the object of the French monarch; and as he had advanced but a little way before his enemy, he &s;aw the danger of precipitating his march over the plains of Picardy, and of expo&s;ing his rear to the in&s;ults of the numerous cavalry, in which the French camp abounded. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Crecy. 26th Augu&s;t</NOTE> He took therefore a very prudent re|&s;olution: He cho&s;e his ground with advantage near the village of Crecy; he di&s;|po&s;ed his army in excellent order; he determined to await in tranquility the ar|rival of the enemy; and he hoped, that their eagerne&s;s to engage, and to pre|vent his retreat, after all their pa&s;t di&s;appointments, would hurry them on to &s;ome ra&s;h and ill-concerted action. He drew up his army on a gentle a&s;cent, and di|vided them into three lines: The fir&s;t was commanded by the prince of Wales, and under him, by the earls of Warwic and Oxford, by Harcourt, and by the lords Chandos, Holland, and other noblemen: The earls of Arundel and Nor|thampton, with the lords Willoughby, Ba&s;&s;et, Roos, and &s;ir Lewis Tufton, were at the head of the &s;econd line: He took on him&s;elf the command of the third divi&s;ion, by which he propo&s;ed either to bring &s;uccour to the two fir&s;t lines, or to &s;ecure a retreat in ca&s;e of any misfortunes, or to pu&s;h his advantages again&s;t his enemy. He had likewi&s;e the precaution to throw up trenches on his flank, in or|der to &s;ecure him&s;elf from the numerous bodies of the French, who might a&s;&s;ail him from that quarter; and he placed all his baggage behind him in a wood, which he al&s;o &s;ecured by an intrenchment<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 128.</NOTE>.</P>

He pointed out to them the nece&s;&s;ity, to which they were at pre&s;ent reduced, and the certain and inevitable de&s;truction which awaited them, if, in their p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;ent &s;ituation, enclo&s;ed on all hands in an enemy's country, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">cted to any thing but their own valour, or gave that enemy an opportunity of raking revenge for the many in&s;ults and indignities, which they had of late put upon him. He reminded them of the apparent &s;uperiority which they had hither|to maintained over all the bodies of French troops who had fallen in their way; and a&s;&s;ured them, that the greater numbers of the army, which at pre&s;ent hovered over them, gave them not greater force, but was an advantage ea&s;ily compen&s;ated by the order, in which he had placed his own army, and the re&s;olution which he expected from them. He demanded nothing, he &s;aid, but that they would imitate his own example, and that of the prince of Wales; and as the honour, the lives, the libert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">es of all, were now expo&s;ed to the &s;ame danger, he was confident, that they would make one common effort to extricate them&s;elves from the pre&s;ent dif|ficulties, and that their united courage would give them the victory over all their enemies.</P>
<P>IT is related by &s;ome hi&s;torians<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jean Villani, lib 12. cap. 66.</NOTE>, that Edward, be&s;ides the re&s;ources, which he found in his own genius and pre&s;ence of mind, employed al&s;o a new inven|tion again&s;t the enemy, and placed in his front &s;ome pieces of artillery, the fir&s;t which had yet been made u&s;e of on any remarkable occa&s;ion in Europe. This is the epoch of one of the mo&s;t &s;ingular di&s;coveries, which has been made among men; and which changed by degrees the whole art of war, and by con&s;equence many circum&s;tances in the political government of Europe. But the ignorance of that age, in the mechanical arts, rendered the progre&s;s very &s;ow of this new inven|tion. The artillery fir&s;t framed, were &s;o clum&s;y and of &s;uch difficult manage|ment, that men were not immediately &s;en&s;ible of their u&s;e and efficacy: And even to the pre&s;ent times, improvements have been continually making on this furious engine, which, tho' it &s;eemed contrived for the de&s;truction of mankind, and the overthrow of empires, has in the i&s;&s;ue rendered war much le&s;s bloody, and has given greater &s;tability to civil &s;ocieties. Nations, by its means, have been brought more to a level: Conque&s;ts have become le&s;s frequent and rapid: Succe&s;s in war has been reduced nearly to be a matter of calculation: And any nation, over|marched by its enemy, either yields to their demands, or &s;ecures it&s;elf by alliances again&s;t their violence and inva&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="203">
THE invention of artillery was at this time known in France as well as in Eng|land<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Du Cange Glo&s;&s;, in verb. Bombarda.</NOTE>; but Philip, in his hurry to overtake the enemy, had probably left his cannon behind him, which he regarded as an u&s;ele&s;s incumbrance. All his other movements di&s;covered the &s;ame imprudence and precipitation. Impelled by an|ger, a dangerous coun&s;ellor, and tru&s;ting to the great &s;uperiority of his numbers, he thought that all depended on forcing an engagement with the Engli&s;h, and that, if he could once reach the enemy in their retreat, the victory on his &s;ide was cer|tain and inevitable. He made a ha&s;ty march in great di&s;order from Abbeville; but after he had advanced above two leagues, &s;ome gentlemen, whom he had &s;ent before to take a view of the enemy, returned to him, and brought him in|telligence, that they had &s;een the Engli&s;h drawn up in excellent order, and await|ing his arrival. They therefore advi&s;ed him to defer the combat till the en&s;uing day, when his army would have recovered from their fatigue, and might be di&s;|po&s;ed into better order, than their pre&s;ent hurry had permitted them to ob&s;erve. Philip a&s;&s;ented to this council; but the former precipitation of his march, and the impatience of the French nobility, made it impracticable for him to put it in execution. One divi&s;ion pre&s;&s;ed upon another: Orders to &s;top were not &s;ea|&s;onably conveyed to all of them: This immen&s;e body was not governed by &s;uffi|cient di&s;cipline to be manageable: And the French army, very imperfectly formed into three lines, arrived, already fatigued and di&s;ordered, in pre&s;ence of the ene|my. The fir&s;t line, con&s;i&s;ting of 15,000 Genoe&s;e cro&s;s-bow men, were com|manded by Anthony Doria, and Charles Grimaldi: The &s;econd was led by the count d'Alen&ccedil;on, brother to the King: The King him&s;elf was at the head of the third. Be&s;ides the French monarch, there were no le&s;s than three crowned heads in this engagement: The King of Bohemia, the King of the Romans, his &s;on, and the King of Majorca; with all the nobility and great va&s;&s;als of the crown of France. The army now con&s;i&s;ted of above 120,000 men, near four times the number of the enemy. But the prudence of one man was &s;uperior to the advan|tage of all this force and &s;plendor.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h, on the approach of the enemy, kept their ranks firm and im|moveable; and the Genoe&s;e fir&s;t began the attack. There had happened, a little before the engagement, a thunder &s;hower, which had moi&s;tened and re|laxed the &s;trings of the Genoe&s;e cro&s;s-bows; and their arrows for this rea&s;on fell &s;hort of the enemy. The Engli&s;h archers, taking their bows out of their ca&s;es, poured in a &s;hower of arrows upon this multitude who were oppo&s;ed to them; and &s;oon threw them into di&s;order.

<P>THE King of France advanced in vain with the rear to &s;u&s;tain the line com|manded by his brother: He found them already di&s;comfited; and the example or their rout encrea&s;ed the confu&s;ion, which was before but too prevalent in his own body.

<P>THIS battle, which is known by the name of the battle of Crecy, began after three o'clock in the afternoon, and continued till evening. The &s;ub&s;equent morning was foggy; and as the Engli&s;h ob&s;erved, that many of the enemy had lo&s;t their way in the night and in the mi&s;t, they employed a &s;tratagem to bring them into their power: They erected on the eminences &s;ome French &s;tandards which they had taken in battle; and all, who were allured by this fal&s;e &s;ignal, were put to the &s;word, and no quarter given them. In excu&s;e for this inhumanity, it was alledged that the French King had given out like orders to his troops; but the real rea&s;on probably was, that the Engli&s;h, in their pre&s;ent &s;ituation, did not care to be encumbered with pri&s;oners. On the day of battle and on the en&s;uing, there fell, by a moderate computation, 1200 knights, 1400 gentlemen, 4000 men at arms, be&s;ides about 30,000 men of inferior rank<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art liv. 1. chap. 131.

<P>THE great prudence of Edward appeared not only in obtaining this memor|able victory, but in the mea&s;ures, which he pur&s;ued after it.

<P>JOHN DE VIENNE, a valiant knight of Burgundy, was governor of Calais, and being &s;upplied with every nece&s;&s;ary for defence, he encouraged the town&s;men to per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">rm to the utmo&s;t their duty to their King and country. Edward therefore, &s;en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ble from the beginning, that it was in vain to attempt the place by force, propo&s;ed only to reduce it by famine: He cho&s;e a &s;ecure &s;tation for his camp; drew entrenchments around the whole city; rai&s;ed huts for his &s;oldiers, which he covered with &s;traw or broom; and provided his army with all conveniencies, to make them endure the winter &s;ea&s;on, which was approaching. As the gover|nor &s;oon perceived his intention, he put out all the u&s;ele&s;s mouths, which might consume his provisions; and the King had the genero&s;ity to allow the&s;e unhappy people to pa&s;s thro' his camp, and he even &s;upplied them with money for their journey<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 133.</NOTE>.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">War with Scotland</NOTE> THE Scotti&s;h nation, after &s;upporting with incredible per&s;everance, their liber|ties again&s;t the &s;uperior force of the Engli&s;h, recalled their King, David Bruce, in 1342. Tho' that prince, neither by his age nor capacity, could bring them great a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he gave them the countenance of &s;overeign authority; and as Edward's wars with France proved a great diver&s;ion to his forces, they rendered the ballance more equal between the two kingdoms. In all the truces, which Edward concluded with Philip, the King of Scotland was comprehended; and when Edward made his la&s;t inva&s;ion upon France, David was &s;trongly &s;ollicited by his ally to break al&s;o the truce, and to invade the northern counties of Eng|land.

This man agreed to deliver up Calais for the &s;um of 20,000 crowns; and Geoffrey de Charni, who commanded the French forces in tho&s;e quarters, and who knew, that, if he &s;ucceeded in this &s;ervice, he &s;hould not be di&s;avowed, ventured, without con&s;ulting his ma&s;ter, to conclude the bargain with him.

He then took a &s;tring of pearl, which he wore about his own head, and throwing it over the head of Ribaumont, he &s;aid to him, <Q REND="inline">"Sir Eu&s;tace, I be&s;tow this pre&s;ent upon you, as a te&s;timony of my e&s;teem for your bravery: And I de&s;ire you to wear it a year for my &s;ake: I know you to be gay and amorous; and to take delight in the company of laides and dam&s;els: Let them all know from what hand you had the pre&s;ent: You are no longer a pri&s;oner; I acquit you of your ran&s;om; and you are at liberty to-morrow to di&s;po&s;e of your&s;elf as you think proper."</Q></P>
<P>NOTHING can more evidently prove the va&s;t &s;uperiority of the nobility and gentry above all the other orders of men during tho&s;e ages, than the extreme dif|ference which Edward made in his treatment of the&s;e French knights, and that of the &s;ix citizens of Calais, who had exerted much more &s;ignal bravery in a cau&s;e much more ju&s;tifiable and more honourable.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE prudent conduct and great &s;ucce&s;s of Edward in his foreign wars had excited a &s;trong emulation and a military genius among the Engli&s;h nobi|lity; and the&s;e turbuient barons, over-awed by the crown, gave now a more u&s;e|ful direction to their ambition, and attached them&s;elves to a prince, who led them to the acqui&s;ition of glory and of riches. <MILESTONE N="1349" UNIT="year"> That he might further promote the &s;pi|rit of emulation and obedience, the King in&s;tituted the order of the garter, in imitation of &s;ome orders of a like nature, religious as well as military, which had been e&s;tabli&s;hed in different countries of Europe. <NOTE PLACE="marg">In&s;titution of the garter.</NOTE> The number received into this order con&s;i&s;ted of twenty-four per&s;ons, be&s;ides the &s;overeign; and as it has never been enlarged, this badge of di&s;tinction continues as honourable as at its fir&s;t in&s;titution, and is &s;till a valuable, tho' a cheap, pre&s;ent, which the prince can confer on his greate&s;t &s;ubjects. A vulgar &s;tory prevails, but is not &s;upported by any antient authority, that, at a court-ball, Edward's mi&s;tre&s;s, commonly &s;up|po&s;ed to be the counte&s;s of Sali&s;bury, dropt her garter; and the King, taking it up, ob&s;erved &s;ome of the courtiers to &s;mile, as if he had not obtained this favour merely by accident: Upon which he called out, <HI>Honi &s;oit qui mal y pen&s;e,</HI> Evil to him that evil thinks; and as every incident of gallantry among the&s;e antient warriors was magnified into a matter of great importance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There was a &s;ingular in&s;tance about this time of the prevalence of chivalry and gallantry in the nations of Europe. A &s;olemn duel of thirty knights again&s;t thirty was fought between Bembrough, an Engli&s;h men, and Beaumanoir, a Breton, of the party of Charles de Blois. The knights of the two na|tions came into the field: and before the combat began, Beaumanoir called out, that it would be &s;een that day <HI>who had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">.</HI> After a bloody combat the Bretons prevailed; and gained for their prize, full liberty to boa&s;t their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es beauty. It is remarkable, that two &s;uch famous generals as &s;ir Robert Knolle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">, and &s;ir Hugh Calverley, drew their &s;words in this ridiculous conte&s;t. See Pere Daniel, vol 2. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">. &amp;c The women not only in&s;tigated the champions to the&s;e rough, if not bloody frays of tournament; but al&s;o frequented the tournaments during all the reign of Edward, who&s;e &s;pirit of gallantry encouraged this practice. See Knyghton, p 2597.</NOTE>, he in&s;tituted the
<PB N="207" REF="213">
order of the garter in memorial of this event, and gave the&s;e words as the motto of the order. This origin, tho' frivolous, is not un&s;uitable to the manners of the times; and it is indeed difficult by any other means to account either for the &s;eemingly unmeaning terms of the motto, or for the peculiar badge of the gar|ter, which &s;eems to have no reference to any purpo&s;e either of military u&s;e or or|nament.</P>
<P>BUT a &s;udden damp was thrown over this fe&s;tivity and triumph of the court of England, by a de&s;tructive pe&s;tilence, which invaded that kingdom as well as the re&s;t of Europe; and is computed to have &s;wept away above a fourth of the in|habitants in every country, which it attacked. It was probably more fatal in great cities than in the country; and above fifty thou&s;and &s;ouls are &s;aid to have peri&s;hed by it in London alone<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stow's Survey, p. 478. There were buried 50,000 bodies in one church yard, which &s;ir Walter Manny had bought for the u&s;e of the poor. The &s;ame author &s;ays, that there died above 50,000 per|&s;ons of the plague in Norwich, which is quite incredible.</NOTE>. This malady di&s;covered it&s;elf fir&s;t in the north of A&s;ia, was &s;pread over all that country, made a progre&s;s from one end of Europe to ano|ther, and &s;en&s;ibly depopulated every &s;tate thro' which it pa&s;&s;ed. So grievous a calamity, more than any cordiality among the princes, &s;erved to maintain and prolong the truce between France and England.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1350" UNIT="year"> DURING this truce, Philip de Valois died, without being able to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the affairs of France, which his bad &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t England had thrown into the mo&s;t extreme di&s;order. This monarch, during the fir&s;t years of his reign, had obtained the appellation of <HI>Fortunate,</HI> and acquired the character of prudent; but he ill maintained either the one or the other; le&s;s from his own fault, than becau&s;e he was over-matched by the &s;uperior fortune and &s;uperior genius of Ed|ward. But the incidents in the reign of his &s;on, John, gave the French nation rea&s;on to regret even the calamitous times of his predece&s;&s;or. John was di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by many virtues, particularly a &s;crupulous honour and fidelity: He was not deficient in per&s;onal courage: But as he wanted that ma&s;terly prudence and fore&s;ight, which his difficult &s;ituation required, his kingdom was at the &s;ame time torn in pieces by inte&s;tine commotions, and oppre&s;&s;ed with foreign wars. <MILESTONE N="1354" UNIT="year"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">State of France.</NOTE> The chief &s;ource of all its calamities, was Charles King of Navarre, who received the epithet of the <HI>bad</HI> or <HI>wicked,</HI> and who&s;e actions fully entitled him to that appella|tion. This prince was de&s;cended of the blood royal of France; his mother was a daughter of Lewis Hutin; he had him&s;elf e&s;pou&s;ed a daughter of King John: But all the&s;e ties, which ought to have connected him with the throne, gave him only greater ability to &s;hake and over throw it. In his per&s;onal qualities, he was
<PB N="208" REF="214">
courteous, affable, engaging, eloquent; full of in&s;inuation and addre&s;s; inex|hau&s;tible in his re&s;ources; active and enterprizing. But the&s;e &s;plendid accom|pli&s;hments were at the &s;ame time attended with &s;uch defects, as rendered them per|nicious to his country, and even ruinous to him&s;elf: He was fickle, incon&s;tant, faithle&s;s, revengeful, malicious: Re&s;trained by no principle or duty: In&s;atiable in his preten&s;ions: And whether &s;ucce&s;sful or unfortunate in one enterprize, he im|mediately undertook another, in which he was never deterred from employing the mo&s;t criminal and mo&s;t di&s;honourable expedients.</P>
<P>THE con&s;table, d'Eu, who had been taken pri&s;oner by Edward at Caen, reco|vered his liberty, on the promi&s;e of delivering to that prince, as his ran&s;om, the town of Ghi&s;nes, near Calais, of which he was &s;uperior lord: But as John was offended at this &s;tipulation, which, if fulfilled, opened &s;till farther that frontier to the enemy, and as he &s;u&s;pected the con&s;table of more dangerous connexions with the King of England, he ordered him to be &s;eized, and without any legal or for|mal trial, put him to death in p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">&s;on. Charles de la Cerda was appointed con|&s;table in his place; and had a like fatal end: The King of Navarre ordered him to be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated; and &s;uch was the weakne&s;s of the crown, that this prince, in|&s;tead of dreading puni&s;hment, would not &s;o much as agree to a&s;k pardon for his offence, but on condition, that he received an acce&s;&s;ion of territory, and had John's &s;econd &s;on put into his hands, as a &s;ecurity for his per&s;on, when he came to court, and performed this act of mock penitence and humiliation before King John<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;&s;art, liv. 1 chap. 144.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="year"> THE two French princes &s;eemed entirely reconciled; but this di&s;&s;imulation, to which John &s;ubmitted from nece&s;&s;ity, and Charles from habit, did not long conti|nue; and the King of Navarre knew, that he had rea&s;on to apprehend the mo&s;t &s;e|vere vengeance for the many crimes and trea&s;ons which he had already committed, and the &s;till greater, which he intended to commit. To en&s;ure him&s;elf of protec|tion, he entered into a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence with England, by means of Henry earl of Derby, now earl of Lanca&s;ter, who at that time was employed in fruitle&s;s nego|tiations for peace in Avignon, under the mediation of the Pope. John di&s;covered this corre&s;pondence; and to prevent the fatal effects of it, he &s;ent down forces into Normandy, the chief &s;eat of the King f Navarre's power, an attacked his ca&s;tles and fortre&s;&s;es But hearing that Edward had prepared an army to &s;upport his allly, he had the weakne&s;s to propo&s;e an accommodation with Charles, and even to give this traiterous &s;ubject the &s;um of an hundred thou&s;and crowns, as the pur|cha&s;e of a reigned reconcilement, which rendered him &s;till more dangerous. The
<PB N="209" REF="215">
King of Navarre, in&s;olent from pa&s;t impunity, and de&s;perate from the dangers, which he apprehended, continued &s;till his intrigues; and a&s;&s;ociating him&s;elf with Geoffrey de Harcourt, who had received his pardon from Philip de Valois, but per&s;evered &s;till in his factious di&s;po&s;itions, he encrea&s;ed the number of his parti|zans in every part of the kingdom. He even &s;educed by his addre&s;s, Charles, the King of France's elde&s;t &s;on, a youth of &s;eventeen years of age, who was the fir&s;t that bore the appellation of Dauphin, by the re-union of the province of Dauphiny to the crown. But this prince, being made &s;en&s;ible of the danger and folly of the&s;e connexions, promi&s;ed to make atonement for the offence by the &s;a|crifice of his a&s;&s;ociates; and in concert with his father, he invited the King of Navarre, and other noblemen of the party, to a fea&s;t at Ro&uuml;en, where they were betrayed into the hands of John. Some of the mo&s;t obnoxious were immediately led to execution; the King of Navarre was thrown into pri&s;on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 146. Ave&s;bury, p. 243.</NOTE>: But this &s;troke of &s;everity in the King, and of treachery in the Dauphin, was far from proving deci&s;ive in maintaining the royal authority. Philip of Navarre, brother to Charles, and Geoffrey d'Harcourt, put all the towns and ca&s;tles belonging to that prince in a po&s;ture of defence; and had immediate recour&s;e to the protection of England in this de&s;perate extremity.</P>
<P>THE truce between the two kingdoms, which had always been very ill ob&s;erved on both &s;ides, was now expired; and Edward was entirely free to &s;upport the French malecontents. Well plea&s;ed, that the factions in France had at la&s;t gained him &s;ome partizans in that kingdom, which his preten&s;ions to the crown had never been able to procure him, he propo&s;ed to attack his enemy both on the &s;ide of Guienne, under the command of the prince of Wales, and on that of Calais, in his own per&s;on.</P>
<P>YOUNG Edward arrived in the Garonne with his army, on board a fleet of three hundred &s;ail, attended by the earls of Warwic, Sali&s;bury, Oxford, Suffolk, and other Engli&s;h noblemen. Being joined by the va&s;&s;als of Ga&s;cony, he took the field; and as the pre&s;ent di&s;orders in John's affairs prevented every proper plan of defence, he carried on with impunity his ravages and deva&s;tations, according to the mode of war in that age. He reduced all the villages and &s;everal towns in Languedoc to a&s;hes: He pre&s;ented him&s;elf before Tholou&s;e; pa&s;&s;ed the Garronne, and burned the &s;uburbs of Carca&s;&s;onne; advanced even to Narbonne, laying every thing wa&s;te around him: And after an incur&s;ion of &s;ix weeks, returned with a va&s;t booty and many pri&s;oners to Guienne, where he took up his winter quarters<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv 1. chap. 144, 146.</NOTE>.

<P>THE King of England's incur&s;ion from Calais was of the &s;ame nature, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ed with the &s;ame i&s;&s;ue. He broke into France at the head of a numerous army; to whom he gave a full licence of plundering and ravaging the open coun|try. He advanced to St. Omer, where the King of France was po&s;ted; and on the retreat of that prince, followed him to He&s;din<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> 1 chap. 144. Ave&s;bury, p. 206. Wal&s;ing. p. 171.</NOTE>. John &s;till kept at a di&s;|tance, and declined an engagement: But in order to &s;ave his reputation, he &s;ent Edward a challenge to fight a pitched battle with him; an u&s;ual bravado in that age, derived from the practice of &s;ingle combat, and ridiculous in the art of war. The King, finding no &s;incerity in this defiance, retired to Calais, and thence went over to England, in order to defend that kingdom again&s;t a threatened inva|&s;ion of the Scots.</P>
<P>THE Scots, taking advantage of the King's ab&s;ence, and that of the military power of England, had &s;urprized Berwic; and had collected an army with a view of entering and committing ravages upon the northern provinces: But on the approach of Edward, they abandoned that place, which was not tenable, while the ca&s;tle was in the hands of the Engli&s;h; and retiring to their mountains, gave the enemy a full liberty of burning and de&s;troying the whole country from Ber|wic to Edinburgh<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 171.</NOTE>. Baliol attended Edward on this expedition; but finding, that his con&s;tant adherence to the Engli&s;h had given his countrymen an uncon|querable aver&s;ion to his title, and that he him&s;elf was declining through age and infirmities, he finally re&s;igned into the King's hands his preten&s;ions to the crown of Scotland<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol 5. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">. Ypod Neu&s;t p. 521.</NOTE>, and received in lieu of them, an annual pen&s;ion of 2000 pounds, with which he pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of his life in privacy and retirement.</P>
<P>DURING the&s;e military operations, Edward received information of the encrea&s;|ing di&s;orders in France, ari&s;ing from the &s;eizure of the King of Navarre: and he &s;ent Lanca&s;ter at the head of a &s;mall army, to &s;upport his partizans in Normandy. The war was conducted with various &s;ucce&s;s; but chiefly to the di&s;advantage of the French malecontents; till an important event happened in the other quarter of the kingdom, which had well nigh proved fatal to the monarchy of France, and threw every thing into the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="year"> THE prince of Wales, encouraged by the &s;ucce&s;s of the preceding campaign, took the field with an army, which no hi&s;torian makes amount to above 12,000

men, and of which not a third were Engli&s;h; and with this &s;mall body, he ven|tured to penetrate into the heart of France. After ravaging the Agenois, Quercy, and the Limou&s;in, he entered the province of Berry; and made &s;ome attacks, tho' without &s;ucce&s;s, on the towns of Bourges and I&s;&s;oudun. It appeared, that his intentions were to march into Normandy, and join his forces to tho&s;e of the duke of Lanca&s;ter, and the partizans of the King of Navarre; but finding all the bridges on the Loire broke down, and every pa&s;s carefully guarded, he was obliged to think of making his retreat into Guienne<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 171.</NOTE>. He found this re&s;olution the more nece&s;&s;ary, from the intelligence which he received of the King of France's motions. That monarch, provoked at the in&s;ult offered him by this incur&s;ion, and entertaining hopes of &s;ucce&s;s from the young prince's temerity, collected a great army of above 60,000 men, and advanced with ha&s;ty marches to intercept his enemy. The prince, not aware of John's near approach, lo&s;t &s;ome days, on his retreat, before the ca&s;tle of Remorantin<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 158. Wal&s;ing. p. 171.</NOTE>; and thereby gave the French an opportunity of overtaking him. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Poic|tiers.</NOTE> They came within &s;ight at Mau|pertuis near Poictiers; and Edward, &s;en&s;ible that his retreat was now become im|practicable, prepared for battle with all the courage of a young hero, and with all the prudence of the olde&s;t and mo&s;t experienced commander.</P>
<P>BUT the utmo&s;t prudence and courage would have proved in&s;ufficient to &s;ave him in this extremity, had the King of France known how to make u&s;e of his pre|&s;ent advantages. His va&s;t &s;uperiority in numbers enabled him to &s;urround the enemy; and by intercepting all their provi&s;ions, which were already become &s;carce in the Engli&s;h camp, to reduce this &s;mall army, without a blow, to the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;urrendering at di&s;cretion. But &s;uch was the impatient ardour of the French nobility, and &s;o much had their thoughts been bent on overtaking the Engli&s;h as their &s;ole object, that this idea never &s;truck any of the commanders; and they immediately prepared them&s;elves for the a&s;&s;ault, as for a certain victory. While the French army was drawn up in order of battle, they were &s;topped by the ap|pearance of the cardinal of Perigord; who, having learned the approach of the two armies to each other, had ha&s;tened, by interpo&s;ing his good offices, to prevent any farther effu&s;ion of Chri&s;tian blood. By John's permi&s;&s;ion, he carried pro|po&s;als to the prince of Wales; and found him &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the bad po&s;ture of his affairs, that an accommodation &s;eemed not impracticable. Edward told him, that he would agree to any terms con&s;i&s;tent with his own honour and that of England; and he offered to purcha&s;e a retreat by re&s;igning all the conque&s;ts, which he had made during this and the former campaign, and by &s;tipulating not to &s;erve again&s;t France during the cour&s;e of &s;even years. But John, imagining that he had
<PB N="212" REF="218">
now got into his hands a &s;ufficient pledge for the re&s;titution of Calais, required that Edward &s;hould &s;urrender him&s;elf pri&s;oner with an hundred of his attendants; and offered on the&s;e terms a &s;afe retreat to the Engli&s;h army. The prince rejected the propo&s;al with di&s;dain; and declared, that whatever fortune &s;hould attend him, England &s;hould never be obliged to pay the price of his ran&s;om. This re&s;olute an&s;wer cut off all hopes of accommodation; but as the day was already &s;pent in negociating, the battle was delayed till the next morning<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 161.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE cardinal of Perigord, as all the prelates of the court of Rome, was ex|tremely attached to the French cau&s;e; but the mo&s;t determined enemy could not have contrived a greater prejudice to John's affairs, than he did them by this delay. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">th Sept.</NOTE> The prince of Wales had lei&s;ure, during the night, to &s;trengthen, by new entrenchments, the po&s;t which he had before &s;o judiciou&s;ly cho&s;en; and he con|trived an ambu&s;h of 300 men at arms, and as many archers, whom he put under the command of the Captal de Buche, and ordered to make a circuit, that they might fall on the flank or rear of the French army during the engagement. The van of his army was commanded by the earl of Warwic, the rear by the earls of Sali&s;bury and Suffolk, the main body by the prince him&s;elf. The lords Chandos, Audeley, and many other brave and experienced commanders, were at the head of different corps of his army.</P>
<P>JOHN al&s;o arranged his forces in three divi&s;ions, nearly equal: The fir&s;t was commanded by the duke of Orleans, the King's brother; the &s;econd by the Dau|phin attended with his two younger brothers; the third by the King him&s;elf, who had by his &s;ide Philip his fourth &s;on and favourite, then about fourteen years of age. There was no reaching the Engli&s;h army but thro' a narrow lane, covered on each &s;ide by hedges; and in order to open this pa&s;&s;age, the mare&s;chals, Andrehen and Clermont, were ordered to advance with a &s;eparate de|tachment of men at arms. While they marched along the lane, a body of En|gli&s;h archers, who lined the hedges, plyed them on each &s;ide with their arrows; and being very near them, yet placed in perfect &s;afety, they coolly took their aim again&s;t the enemy, and ma&s;&s;acred them with impunity. The French detach|ment, much di&s;couraged with the unequal fight, and dimini&s;hed in their num|ber, arrived at the end of the lane, where they met on the open grounds the prince of Wales him&s;elf, at the head of a cho&s;en body, ready for their reception. They were di&s;comfited and overthrown: One of the mare&s;chals was &s;lain; ano|ther taken pri&s;oner: And the remainder of the detachment, who were &s;till in the lane, and expo&s;ed to the &s;hot of the enemy, without being able to make re&s;i&s;t|ance,

recoiled upon their own army, and put every thing into di&s;order<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 162.</NOTE>. In that critical moment, the Captal de Buche unexpectedly appeared, and attacked in flank the Dauphin's line, which fell into &s;ome confu&s;ion. Landas, Bodenai and St. Venant, to whom the care of that young prince and his brothers had been committed, too anxious for their charge or for their own &s;afety, carried them off the field to Chauvigny, and &s;et the example of flight, which was followed, by that whole divi&s;ion. The duke of Orleans, &s;eized with a like panic, and ima|gining all was lo&s;t, thought no longer of fighting, but carried off his divi&s;ion by a retreat, which &s;oon turned al&s;o into a &s;light. The lord Chandos called out to the prince, that the day was won; and encouraged him to attack the divi&s;ion, under King John, which, tho' more numerous than the whole Engli&s;h army, were &s;omewhat di&s;mayed with the precipitate flight of their companions. John here made the utmo&s;t efforts to retrieve by his valour, what his imprudence had betrayed; and the only re&s;i&s;tance made that day was by his line of battle.

He came forth to meet the captive King with all the &s;igns of regard and &s;ympathy; admini&s;tered comfort to him amid&s;t his mi&s;|fortunes; paid him the tribute of prai&s;e due to his valour; and a&s;cribed his own victory merely to the blind chance of war or to a &s;uperior providence, which con|trouls all the efforts of human force and prudence<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Paull.

The behaviour of John &s;howed him not unworthy of this courteous treatment: His pre&s;ent abject for|tune never made him forget a moment that he was a King: More &s;en&s;ible to Edward's genero&s;ity than to his own calamities, he confe&s;&s;ed, that, notwith|&s;tanding his defeat and captivity, his honour was &s;till unimpaired; and that, if he yielded the victory, it was at lea&s;t gained by a prince of &s;uch con&s;ummate va|lour and humanity.</P>
<P>EDWARD ordered a magnificent repa&s;t to be prepared in his tent for the pri&s;o|ners; and he him&s;elf &s;erved the royal captive's table, as if he had been one of his retinue: He &s;tood at the King's back during the meal; con&s;tantly refu&s;ed to take a place at table; and declared, that, being a &s;ubject, he was too well acquainted with the di&s;tance between his own rank, and that of royal maje&s;ty, to a&s;&s;ume &s;uch freedom. All his father's preten&s;ions to the crown of France were now buried in oblivion: John in captivity received the honours of a King, which were re|fu&s;ed him, when &s;eated on the throne: His misfortunes, not his title, were re|&s;pected: And the French pri&s;oners, conquered by this elevation of mind, more than by their late di&s;comfiture, bur&s;t out into tears of joy and admiration; which were only checked by the reflection, that &s;uch genuine and unaltered heroi&s;m in an enemy mu&s;t certainly in the i&s;&s;ue prove but the more dangerous to their native country<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 168.</NOTE>.</P>

<MILESTONE UNIT="year"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">State of France.</NOTE> MEANWHILE, the captivity of John, joined to the preceding di&s;orders of the French government, had produced in that country a di&s;&s;olution, almo&s;t total, of civil authority, and had occa&s;ioned confu&s;ions, the mo&s;t horrible and de&s;tructive, which had ever been experienced in any age or in any nation. The Dauphin, now about eighteen years of age, naturally a&s;&s;umed the royal power during his father's captivity; but tho' endowed with excellent abilities, even in &s;uch early years, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed neither the experience nor authority requi&s;ite to defend a &s;tate, a&s;&s;ailed at once by foreign power and &s;haken by internal factions. In order to obtain &s;upply, he a&s;&s;embled the &s;tates of the kingdom: That a&s;&s;embly, in&s;tead of &s;upporting his admini&s;tration, were them&s;elves &s;eized with the &s;pirit of confu|&s;ion, and laid hold of the pre&s;ent opportunity to demand limitations of the prince's power, the puni&s;hment of pa&s;t malver&s;ations, and the liberty of the King of Navarre. Marcel, provo&s;t of the merchants and fir&s;t magi&s;trate of Paris, put him&s;elf at the head of the unruly populace; and from the violence and temerity of his character, pu&s;hed them to commit the mo&s;t criminal outrages again&s;t the roy|al authority. They detained the Dauphin in a &s;ort of captivity; they mur|dered in his pre&s;ence Robert de Clermont and John de Conflans, mare&s;chals of France; they threatened all the other mini&s;ters with a like fate; and when Charles, who was obliged to temporize and di&s;&s;emble, made his e&s;cape from their hands, they levied war again&s;t him, and openly erected the &s;tandard of rebellion. The other cities of the kingdom, in imitation of the capital, &s;hook off the Dauphin's authority; took the government into their own hands; and &s;pread the di&s;or|der into every province. The nobles, who&s;e inclinations led them to adhere to the crown, and were naturally di&s;po&s;ed to check the&s;e tumults, had lo&s;t all their influence; and being reproached with cowardice on account of the ba&s;e de&s;ertion of their &s;overeign in the battle of Poictiers, were treated with univer&s;al contempt by the inferior orders. The troops, who, from the deficiency of pay, were no longer retained in di&s;cipline, threw off all regard to their officers, &s;ought the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ance by pillage and robbery, and a&s;&s;ociating to them all the di&s;orderly people, with which that age abounded, formed numerous bands, which infe&s;ted all quarters of the kingdom. They laid the open country de&s;olate; burned and plundered the villages; and by cutting off all means of communication or &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, reduced even the inhabitants of the walled towns to the mo&s;t extreme nece&s;&s;ity. The pea|&s;ants, formerly oppre&s;&s;ed, and now left unprotected, by their ma&s;ters, became de&s;|perate from their pre&s;ent mi&s;ery; and ri&s;ing every where in arms, carried to the la&s;t extremity tho&s;e di&s;orders, which were derived from the &s;edition of the citizens and di&s;banded &s;oldiers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 182, 183, 184.</NOTE>.

expo&s;ed to the violence of popular rage; and in&s;tead of meeting with regard for their pa&s;t dignity, became only, on that account, the object of more wanton in&s;ult to the mutinous pea&s;ants.

In other civil wars, the oppo&s;ite factions, falling under the government of their &s;everal leaders, commonly pre&s;erve &s;till the ve&s;tige of &s;ome rule and order: But here the wild &s;tate of nature &s;eemed to be renewed: Every man was thrown loo&s;e and independant from his fellows: And the great multitude of people, which had ari&s;en from the preceding police of civil &s;ociety, &s;erved only to encrea&s;e the horrour and confu&s;ion of the &s;cene.</P>

But while he advanced this claim, he relied entirely on his alliance with the Engli&s;h, who were concerned in intere&s;t to di&s;appoint his preten&s;ions, and who, being public and inveterate enemies to the &s;tate, &s;erved only, by the friend&s;hip which they &s;eem|ingly bore him, to render his cau&s;e the more odious: And in all his operations, he acted more like a leader of banditti, than one who a&s;pired to be the head of a regu|lar government, and who was engaged by his &s;tation to endeavour the re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of order in the community.</P>

<P>DURING the confu&s;ion in the Dauphin's affairs, Edward &s;eemed to have a fa|vourable opportunity of pu&s;hing his conque&s;ts: But be&s;ides that his hands were tied by the truce, and he could only a&s;&s;i&s;t underhand the faction of Navarre; the &s;tate of the Engli&s;h finances and military power during tho&s;e ages rendered the kingdom incapable of making any regular or &s;teddy effort, and obliged it to ex|ert its force at very di&s;tant intervals, by which all the projected ends were com|monly di&s;appointed. Edward employed him&s;elf, during a conjuncture &s;o in|viting, chiefly in negotiations with his pri&s;oner; and John had the weakne&s;s to &s;ign terms of peace, which, had they taken effect, mu&s;t have totally ruined and di&s;membered his kingdom. He agreed to re&s;tore all the provinces, which had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Henry II. and his two &s;ons, and to annex them for ever to England without any obligation of homage or fealty on the part of the En|gli&s;h monarch. But the Dauphin and the &s;tates of France rejected this treaty, &s;o di&s;honourable and pernicious to the kingdom<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 201.</NOTE>; and Edward, on the expira|tion of the truce, having now, by &s;ub&s;idies and frugality, collected &s;ome trea|&s;ure, prepared him&s;elf for a new inva&s;ion of France.</P>
<P>THE great authority and renown of the King and the prince of Wales, the &s;plendid &s;ucce&s;s of their former enterprizes, and the certain pro&s;pect of plunder from the defencele&s;s provinces of France, &s;oon brought together all the military power of England; and the &s;ame motives invited to Edward's &s;tandard all the hardy adventurers of the different countries of Europe<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 205.</NOTE>.

The earl, now duke of Lanca&s;ter (for this title was introduced into England during the pre&s;ent reign) endeavoured to &s;often the rigor of the&s;e terms, and to terminate the war on more equal and rea&s;onable conditions. He in&s;i&s;ted with Edward, that, notwith&s;tanding his great and &s;urprizing &s;ucce&s;&s;es, the ob|ject of the war, if &s;uch was to be e&s;teemed the acqui&s;ition of the crown of France, was not become any nearer than at the commencement of it; or rather, was &s;et at a greater di&s;tance by tho&s;e very victories and advantages, which &s;eemed to lead to it.

The events of his reign, compared with tho&s;e of the preceding, are a proof, how little rea&s;on kingdoms have to va|lue them&s;elves on their victories, or to be humbled by their defeats, which in reality ought to be a&s;cribed entirely to the good or bad conduct of their rulers, and go a very little way towards determining national characters and manners.</P>

<P>PETER, King of Ca&s;tile, &s;tigmatized by his contemporaries and by po&s;terity, with the epithet of <HI>Cruel,</HI> had filled with blood and murder his kingdom and his own family; and having incurred the univer&s;al hatred of his &s;ubjects, he kept only from pre&s;ent terror an anxious and precarious po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne.

The a&s;cendant which they then began to acquire over France, their rival and national enemy, makes them ca&s;t their eyes on this period with great complacency, and &s;anctifies every mea&s;ure, which Edward embraced for that end. But the dome&s;tic government of this prince is really more admirable than his foreign victories; and England enjoyed, by the prudence and vigor of his admini&s;tration, a longer interval of dome&s;tic peace and tranquillity than &s;he had been ble&s;t with in any former period, or than &s;he experienced for many ages after. He gained the affections of the great, yet curbed their licentiou&s;ne&s;s: He made them feel his power, without their daring, or even being inclined, to murmur at it: His affable and obliging behaviour, his munificence and genero&s;ity, made them &s;ubmit with plea&s;ure to his dominion; his valor and conduct made them &s;ucce&s;sful in mo&s;t of their en|terprizes; and their unquiet &s;pirits, directed again&s;t a public enemy, had no lei&s;ure to breed tho&s;e di&s;turbances, to which they were naturally &s;o much in|clined, and which the frame of the government &s;eemed &s;o much to authorize. This was the chief benefit, which re&s;ulted from Edward's victories and conque&s;ts. His foreign wars were, in other re&s;pects, neither founded in ju&s;tice, nor directed to any very &s;alutary purpo&s;e. His attempt again&s;t the King of Scotland, a minor and a brother-in-law, and the revival of his grandfather's claim of &s;uperiority over that kingdom, were both unrea&s;onable and ungenerous; and he allowed him&s;elf to be too &s;oon &s;educed, by the glaring pro&s;pect of French conque&s;ts, from the acqui&s;ition of a point, which was practicable, and which might really, if attain|ed, have been of la&s;ting utility to his country and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. The &s;ucce&s;s, which he met with in France, tho' chiefly owing to his eminent talents, was unexpected; and yet, from the very nature of things, not from any unfore&s;een accident, was found, even during his own life-time, to have procured him no &s;olid advantages.

This remark is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, tho' imperfectly, ju&s;tified by the conduct of Edward III. He took no &s;teps of moment without con&s;ulting his parliament, and obtaining their approbation, which he afterwards pleaded as a rea&s;on for their &s;upporting his mea&s;ures<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Abridg. p. 108, 120.</NOTE>. The parliament therefore ro&s;e into greater con&s;ideration during his reign, and acquired a more regular authority than in any former times; and even the hou&s;e of commons, which, during tur|bulent and factious periods, was naturally oppre&s;&s;ed by the greater power of the crown, and barons, began to appear of &s;ome weight in the con&s;titution. In the latter years of Edward, the King's mini&s;ters were impeached in parliament, par|ticularly lord Latimer, who fell a &s;acrifice to their authority<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Abridg. p. 122.</NOTE>; and they even obliged him to bani&s;h his mi&s;tre&s;s by their remon&s;trances.

<P>ONE of the mo&s;t popular laws, enacted by any prince, was the &s;tatute, which pa&s;&s;ed in the twenty-fifth of this reign<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Chap. 2.</NOTE>, and which limited the ca&s;es of high trea&s;on, before vague and uncertain, to three principal heads, the con&s;piring the death of the King, the levying war again&s;t him, and the adhering to his ene|mies; and the judges were prohibited, if any other ca&s;es &s;hould occur, from in|flicting the penalty of trea&s;on, without an application to parliament. The bounds of trea&s;on were indeed &s;o much limited by this &s;tatute, which &s;till remains in force without any alteration, that the lawyers were obliged to enlarge them, and to explain a con&s;piracy for levying war again&s;t the King to be equivalent to a con&s;piracy again&s;t his life; and this interpretation, &s;eemingly forced, has, from the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e, been tacitly acquie&s;ced in. It was al&s;o ordained, that a parliament &s;hould be held once a year or oftner, if need be: A law which, like many others, was never ob&s;erved, and lo&s;t its authority by di&s;u&s;e<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">4 Edw.

If the maxims of Edward's reign had not been in general &s;omewhat arbitrary, and if the great charter had not been fre|quently violated, the parliament would never have applied for the&s;e frequent

confirmations, which could add no force to a deed regularly ob&s;erved, and which could &s;erve to no other purpo&s;e, than to prevent the contrary precedents from turning into a rule, and acquiring authority. It was indeed the effect of the irregular go|vernment during tho&s;e ages, that a &s;tatute, which had been enacted &s;ome years, in&s;tead of acquiring, was imagined to lo&s;e force by time, and needed to be often renewed by recent &s;tatutes of the &s;ame &s;en&s;e and tenor. Hence likewi&s;e that ge|neral clau&s;e, &s;o frequent in old acts of parliament, that the &s;tatutes, enacted by the King's progenitors, &s;hall be ob&s;erved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">36 Edw III. cap. 1. 37 Edw.

The frequent confirmations in general terms of the church's privileges proceeded from the &s;ame cau&s;e.</P>
<P>IT is a clau&s;e in one of Edward's &s;tatutes, <HI>that no man, of what e&s;tate or con|dit on &s;oever, &s;hall be put out of land or tenement, nor taken nor impri&s;oned, nor di&s;herited, nor put to death, without being brought in an&s;wer by due proce&s;s of the law</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">28 Edw.

<P>BUT there is no article, in which the laws are more frequently repeated during this reign, almo&s;t in the &s;ame terms, than that of purveyance, which the parlia|ment always calls an <HI>outrageous</HI> and <HI>intolerable</HI> grievance, and the &s;ource of <HI>infinite</HI> damage to the people<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">36 Edw.

The prince frequently wanted ready money; yet his family mu&s;t be provided for: And he was obliged to employ force and violence for that pur|po&s;e, and to give tallies, at what rate he plea&s;ed, to the owners of the goods which he laid hold of.

any price from the King; e&s;pecially in his frequent progre&s;&s;es, when he came to di&s;tant and poor places, where the court did not u&s;ually re&s;ide, and where a regular plan for &s;upplying it could not ea&s;ily be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>THE magnificent ca&s;tle of Wind&s;or was built by Edward III. and his method of conducting that work may &s;erve as a &s;pecimen of the condition of the people in that age. In&s;tead of alluring workmen by contracts and wages, he a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every county in England to &s;end him &s;o many ma&s;ons, tilers, and carpenters, as if he had been levying an army<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A&s;hmole's hi&s;t. of the garter, p. 129.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THEY mi&s;take, indeed, very much the genius of this reign, who imagine that it was not very arbitrary.

<P>BUT there was no act of arbitrary power more frequently repeated in this reign, than that of the impo&s;ition of taxes without con&s;ent of parliament.

THE King openly avowed and maintained this power of levying taxes at plea|&s;ure.

This incident pa&s;&s;ed a very few days before his death; and the&s;e were, in a manner, his la&s;t words to his people.

In &s;o much a better condition were the privileges of the people even during the arbitrary reign of Edward III. than during &s;ome &s;ub&s;equent ones, particularly tho&s;e of the Tu|dors, where no tyranny or abu&s;e of power ever met with any check or oppo&s;ition, or &s;o much as a remon&s;trance, from parliament.</P>
<P>IT is ea&s;y to imagine, that a prince of &s;o much &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit as Edward, would be no &s;lave to the court of Rome.

<P>COMMERCE and indu&s;try were certainly at a very low ebb during this period. The bad police of the country alone affords a &s;ufficient rea&s;on. The only ex|ports were wool, &s;kins, hydes, leather, butter, tin, lead, and &s;uch unmanufac|tured goods, of which wool was by far the mo&s;t con&s;iderable. Knyghton has a&s;&s;erted, that 100,000 &s;acks of wool were annually exported, and &s;old at twen|ty pounds a &s;ack, money of that age.

In 1349, the parliamennt remon&s;trate, that the King, by an illegal impo&s;ition of forty &s;hillings on each &s;ack exported, had levied 60,000 pounds a year<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 48, 69.</NOTE>: Which reduces the annual exports to 30,000 &s;acks.

Knyghton's computation rai&s;es it to &s;ixty pounds, which is near four times the pre&s;ent price of wool in England.

It is remarkable, that in the &s;ame reign, the pay of a common &s;oldier, an archer, was &s;ix pence a day; which, by the change, both in denomination and value, would be equivalent to four or five &s;hillings of our pre&s;ent money<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Dugdale's baronage, vol. 1. p. 784.

<P>THERE is not a reign among tho&s;e of the antient Engli&s;h monarchs, which de&s;erves more to be &s;tudied than that of Edward III. nor one where the dome&s;tic tran&s;actions will better di&s;cover the true genius of that kind of mixed govern|ment, which was then e&s;tabli&s;hed in England. The &s;truggles, with regard to the validity and authority of the great charter, were now over: The King was acknowledged to lie under &s;ome limitations: Edward him&s;elf was a prince of great capacity, not governed by favourites, not led a&s;tray by any unruly pa&s;&s;ion; &s;en&s;ible that nothing could be more e&s;&s;ential to his intere&s;ts than to keep on good terms with his people: Yet on the whole it appears, that the government, at be&s;t, was only a barbarous monarchy, not regulated by any fixed maxims, nor bounded by any certain undi&s;puted rights, which were in practice regularly ob&s;erved. The King conducted him&s;elf by one &s;et of principles; the barons by another; the commons by a third; the clergy by a fourth. All the&s;e &s;y&s;tems of government were contrary and incompatible: Each of them prevailed according as incidents were favourable to it: A great prince rendered the monarchical power predomi|nant: The weakne&s;s of a King gave reins to the ari&s;tocracy: A &s;uper&s;titious age &s;aw the clergy triumphant: The people, for whom alone government was in&s;ti|tuted, and who alone de&s;erve con&s;ideration, were commonly the weake&s;t of the

whole. But the commons, little obnoxious to any other order; tho' they &s;unk under the violence of tempe&s;ts, &s;ilently reared their head in more peaceable times; and while the &s;torm was brewing, were courted by all &s;ides, and thus received &s;till &s;ome acce&s;&s;ion to their privileges, or, at wor&s;t, &s;ome confirmation of them.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1377" UNIT="year"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Government durin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the mi|nority.</NOTE> THE parliament, which was &s;ummoned &s;oon after the King's acce&s;&s;ion, was both elected and a&s;&s;embled in tranquility; and the great change, from a &s;overeign of con&s;ummate wi&s;dom and experience, to a boy of eleven years of age, was not immediately perceived by the people. The habits of order and obedience, which the barons had been taught during the long reign of Edward, &s;till influ|enced them; and the authority of the King's three uncles, the dukes of Lanca&s;ter, York, and Gloce&s;ter, &s;ufficed to repre&s;s, for a time, the turbulent &s;pirit, to which that order, in a weak reign, was &s;o often &s;ubject. The dangerous ambition too of the&s;e princes them&s;elves was checked, by the plain and undeniable title of Richard, by the declaration of it made by his grandfather in parliament, and by the affectionate regard, which the people bore to the memory of his father, and which was naturally transferred to the young prince upon the throne. The differ|ent characters of the&s;e three dukes, rendered them al&s;o a counterpoize to each other; and it was natural to expect, that any dangerous de&s;igns, which might be formed by one brother, would meet with oppo&s;ition from the others. Lan|ca&s;ter, who&s;e age and experience and authority under the late King, gave him the a&s;cendant among them; tho' his integrity &s;eemed not proof again&s;t great

temptations, was neither of an enterprizing &s;pirit, nor of a popular and engaging temper. York was indolent, unactive, and of a &s;lender capacity. Gloce&s;ter was turbulent, bold, and popular; but being the younge&s;t of the family, was re|&s;trained by the power and authority of his elder brothers. There appeared, there|fore, no circum&s;tance in the dome&s;tic &s;ituation of England, which might endan|ger the public peace, or give any immediate apprehen&s;ions to the lovers of their country.</P>
<P>BUT as Edward, tho' he had fixed the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown, had taken no care to e&s;tabli&s;h a plan of government during the minority of his grand&s;on; it behoved the parliament to &s;upply this defect: And the hou&s;e of commons di&s;|tingui&s;hed them&s;elves, by taking the lead on that occa&s;ion. This hou&s;e, which had been ri&s;ing to con&s;ideration during the whole cour&s;e of the late reign, natu|rally received an acce&s;&s;ion of power during the minority; and as it was now becoming a &s;cene of bufine&s;s, the commons cho&s;e for the fir&s;t time a &s;peaker, who might pre&s;erve order in their debates, and maintain tho&s;e forms, which are requi&s;ite in all numerous a&s;&s;emblies. Peter de la Mare was the man pitched on; the &s;ame per&s;on who had been impri&s;oned and detained in cu&s;tody by the late King for his freedom of &s;peech in attacking the mi&s;tre&s;s and the mini&s;ters of that prince. But tho' this election di&s;covered a &s;pirit of liberty in the com|mons, and was followed by farther attacks both on the&s;e mini&s;ters, and on Alice Pierce<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 150.</NOTE>, they were &s;till too much &s;en&s;ible of their great inferiority, to a&s;&s;ume at fir&s;t any immediate &s;hare in the admini&s;tration of government, or the care of the King's per&s;on. They were contented to apply by petition to the lords for that purpo&s;e, and de&s;ire them both to appoint a council of nine, who might direct the public bu&s;ine&s;s, and to choo&s;e men of a virtuous life and conver&s;ation, who might in&s;pect the conduct and education of the young prince. The lords com|plied with the fir&s;t part of this reque&s;t, and elected the bi&s;hops of London, Car|li&s;le, and Sali&s;bury, the earls of Marche and Stafford, &s;ir Richard de Stafford, &s;ir Henry le Scrope, &s;ir John Devereux, and &s;ir Hugh Segrave, to whom they gave authority for a year to conduct the ordinary cour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 7. p. 161.</NOTE>. But as to the regulation of the King's hou&s;ehold, they declined interpo&s;ing in an office, which, they &s;aid, was both &s;o invidious in it&s;elf, and might prove &s;o di&s;agreeable to his maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>THE commons, as they acquired more courage, ventured to proceed a &s;tep further in their applications. They pre&s;ented a petition, in which they prayed the King to check the prevailing cu&s;tom among the barons, of forming illegal confe|deracies
<PB N="243" REF="251">
together, and &s;upporting each other, as well as men of inferior rank, in the violations of law and ju&s;tice. They received from the throne a general and an obliging an&s;wer to this petition: But another part of their application, that all the great officers &s;hould, during the King's minority, be appointed by parlia|ment, which &s;eemed to require the concurrence of the commons, as well as that of the upper hou&s;e, in the nomination, was not complied with: The lords alone a&s;|&s;umed the power of appointing the&s;e officers: The commons tacitly acquie&s;ced in their choice; and thought, that, for the pre&s;ent, they had proceeded a &s;uffici|ent length, if they but advanced their preten&s;ions, tho' rejected, of interpo&s;ing in the&s;e more important matters of &s;tate.</P>
<P>ON this footing then the government &s;tood.

The danger was now deemed by the King's uncles &s;omewhat &s;erious; and a great army of 60,000 men was levied and conducted again&s;t Scotland, with Richard him&s;elf at the head of it. The Scots pretended not to make re&s;i&s;tance to &s;o great a force: They abandoned without &s;cruple their country to be pillaged and de&s;troyed by the enemy: And when de Vienne expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urprize at this plan of operations, they told him, that all their cattle was driven into the fore&s;ts and fa&s;tne&s;&s;es; that their hou&s;es and other goods were of no value; and that they well knew how to compen&s;ate them&s;elves for any lo&s;&s;es, which they might &s;u&s;tain in that re&s;pect, by making an inva&s;ion on the Engli&s;h.

A few days after, they appeared in his pre&s;ence, armed and attended with armed followers; and they accu&s;ed by name the archbi&s;hop of York, the duke of Ireland, the earl of Suffolk, &s;ir Robert Tre|&s;ilian, and &s;ir Nicholas Brembre, as publick and dangerous enemies to the &s;tate.

<P>THE duke of Ireland fled to Che&s;hire, and levied &s;ome forces, with which he advanced to relieve the King from the violence of the nobles.

<P>BUT the&s;e were not the only acts of violence committed during the triumph of the party.

<P>THE parliament concluded this violent &s;cene by a declaration, that none of the articles, decided on the&s;e trials to be trea&s;on, &s;hould ever afterwards be drawn into precedent by the judges, who were &s;till to con&s;ider the &s;tatute of the twenty-fifth of Edward as the rule of their conduct.

The hi&s;tory of this reign is very imperfect, and very little to be depended on; except where it is &s;upported by the public records: And it is not ea&s;y for us to a&s;&s;ign the rea&s;on of this unexpected event.

Perhaps, the violence of their former proceedings had lo&s;t them the affections of the people, who &s;oon repent of any cruel extremities, to which they are carried by their leaders. However this may be, Richard exer|ci&s;ed with moderation the authority which he had re&s;umed.

The members were either country gentlemen, or mer|chants, who were a&s;&s;embled for a few days, and were entirely unacquainted with bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;o that it was ea&s;y to lead them a&s;tray, and draw them into votes and re&s;olutions very different from their &s;ettled purpo&s;e. A member had propo&s;ed &s;ome petitions concerning the &s;tate of the nation; in which, among other things, the hou&s;e recommended frugality to the King, and for that purpo&s;e, de&s;ired, that the court &s;hould not be &s;o much frequented as formerly with <HI>bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>ladies.</HI> The King was di&s;plea&s;ed with this freedom: The commons very humbly craved pardon: He was not &s;atisfied unle&s;s they would name the mover of that petition. It happened to be one Haxey, whom the parliament, in order to make attonement, condemned for this offence to die the death of a traitor. But the King, at the de|&s;ire of the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and the prelates, pardoned him. When a parliament in tho&s;e times, not agitated by any faction, and being at entire freedom, could be guilty of &s;uch mon&s;trous ex|travagance, it is ea&s;y to judge what might be expected from them in more trying &s;ituations.

<P>AFTER the de&s;truction of the duke of Gloce&s;ter and the heads of that party, a mi&s;under&s;tanding broke out among tho&s;e noblemen, who had joined in the pro|&s;ecution; and the King wanted either authority &s;ufficient to appea&s;e it, or fore|&s;ight to prevent it.

See Cotton, p. 564.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE duke of Hereford was certainly very little delicate in point of honour, to betray a private conver&s;ation to the ruin of the per&s;on who entru&s;ted him; and we may thence be more inclined to believe the duke of Norfolk's denial, than the other's a&s;&s;everation. But Norfolk had in the&s;e tran&s;actions betrayed an equal ne|glect of honour, which brings him entirely to a level with his antagoni&s;t.

Such were the principles and practices of tho&s;e antient knights and barons during the prevalence of the feudal government, and the reign of chivalry.</P>
<P>THE li&s;ts for this deci&s;ion of truth and right were appointed at Coventry be|fore the King: All the nobility of England bandied into parties, and adhered either to the one duke or the other: The whole nation was held in &s;u&s;pence with regard to the event: But when the two champions appeared in the field, accou|tered for the combat, the King interpo&s;ed to prevent, both the pre&s;ent effu&s;ion of &s;uch noble blood, and the future con&s;equences of the quarrel. By the advice and authority of the parliamentary commi&s;&s;ioners, he &s;topped the duel; and to &s;how his impartiality, he ordered, by the &s;ame authority, both the combatants to leave the kingdom<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 380.

Every place was in commotion: The malecontents in all quarters flew to arms: London di&s;covered the &s;tronge&s;t &s;ymptoms of its di&s;po|&s;ition to mutiny and rebellion: And Henry's army, encrea&s;ing on every day's march, &s;oon amounted to the number of 60,000 men.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">General in|&s;urrection.</NOTE> THE duke of York was left guardian of the realm; a place to which his birth intitled him, but which both his &s;lender abilities, and his natural connexions with the duke of Lanca&s;ter, rendered him utterly incapable of filling in &s;uch a dan|gerous emergency. All the chief nobility, who were attached to the crown, and who could either have &s;econded the guardian's good intentions, or have over|awed his infidelity, had attended the King into Ireland; and the efforts of Rich|ard's friends were every where more feeble than tho&s;e of his enemies. The duke of York, however, appointed the rendezvous of his forces at St. Albans, and &s;oon a&s;&s;embled an army of 40,000 men; but found them entirely de&s;titute of zeal and attachment to the royal cau&s;e, and more inclined to join the party of the rebels. He hearkened therefore very readily to a me&s;&s;age from Henry, who entreated him not to oppo&s;e a loyal and humble &s;upplicant in the recovery of his legal patrimony; and the Guardian even declared publicity that he would &s;econd his nephew in &s;o rea&s;onable a reque&s;t. His army, embraced with acclamations the &s;ame party; and the duke of Lanca&s;ter, re-inforced by their numbers, was now intirely ma&s;ter of the kingdom.

<P>THE King, receiving intelligence of this inva&s;ion and in&s;urrection, ha&s;tened over from Ireland, and landed in Milford Haven with a body of 20,000 men: But even this army, &s;o much inferior to the enemy, were either overawed by the general combination of the kingdom, or &s;eized with the &s;ame &s;pirit of rebellion; and they gradually de&s;erted him, till he found that he had not above 6000 men, who followed his &s;tandard. It appeared, therefore, nece&s;&s;ary to retire &s;ecretly from this &s;mall body, which &s;erved only to expo&s;e him to danger; and he fled to the i&s;le of Angle&s;ea, where he purpo&s;ed to embark either for Ireland or France, and there await the favourable opportunities, which the re|turn of his &s;ubjects to a &s;en&s;e of duty, or their future di&s;contents again&s;t the duke of Lanca&s;ter, would probably afford him. Henry, &s;en&s;ible of this danger, &s;ent to him the earl of Northumberland with the &s;tronge&s;t profe&s;&s;ions of loyalty and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and that nobleman, by treachery and fal&s;e oaths, made him&s;elf ma&s;|ter of the King's per&s;on, and carried him to his enemy at Flint ca&s;tle. <NOTE PLACE="marg">1&s;t Septr.</NOTE> Richard was conducted to London, by the duke of Lanca&s;ter, who was there received with the acclamations of the mutinous populace.

<P>IF we examine the&s;e articles, which are expre&s;&s;ed with extreme acrimony again&s;t Richard, we &s;hall find, that, except &s;ome ra&s;h &s;peeches, which are imputed to him<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Art. 16, 26.</NOTE>, and of who&s;e reality, as they are &s;aid to have pa&s;&s;ed in private conver&s;ation, we may very rea&s;onably entertain &s;ome doubt; the chief amount of the charge is contained in his violent conduct during the la&s;t years of his reign, and naturally divides it&s;elf into two principal heads. The fir&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;iderable is the revenge, which he took on the princes and great barons, who had formerly u&s;urped, and &s;till per&s;evered in controuling and threatning his authority; the &s;econd is the violation of the laws and general privileges of his people. But the former, however irregular in many of its circum&s;tances, was fully &s;upported by authority of parliament, and was but a copy of the violence, which the princes and barons them&s;elves, during their former triumph, had exerci&s;ed again&s;t him and his party. The detention of Lanca&s;ter's e&s;tate was, properly &s;peaking, a revocation, by the appearance at lea&s;t of parliamentary authority, of a grace, which the King him&s;elf had formerly granted him. The murder of Gloce&s;ter (for the &s;ecret execution, however merited, of that prince, certainly de&s;erves this appellation) was a private deed, formed not any precedent, and implied not any a&s;&s;umed or arbitrary power of the crown, which could ju&s;tly give umbrage to the people. It was really the effect of the King's weakne&s;s, rather than ambition; and proves, that, in&s;tead of being dangerous to the con&s;titution, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not even the authority requi&s;ite for the execution of the laws.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd head of accu&s;ation, as it con&s;i&s;ts mo&s;tly of general facts, and was framed by Richard's inveterate enemies, and was never allowed to be an&s;wered by him or his friends; it is more difficult to form a judgment of. The greate&s;t part of the&s;e grievances, objected to Richard, &s;eems to be the exertion of arbitrary preroga|tives; &s;uch as the di&s;pen&s;ing power<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Art. 13, 17, 18.</NOTE>, levying purveyance<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Art. 22.</NOTE>, employing the mar|&s;hal's court<NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">Art. 27.</NOTE>, extorting loans<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Art. 14.</NOTE>, granting protections from law-&s;uits<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Art. 16.</NOTE>; pre|rogatives, which, tho' often complained of, had often been exerci&s;ed by his predece&s;&s;ors, and &s;till continued to be &s;o by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. But whether his ir|regular

acts of this kind were more frequent and injudicious and violent than u&s;ual, or were only laid hold of and more exaggerated, by the factions, to which the weakne&s;s of his reign had given birth, we are not able at this di&s;tance to de|termine with certainty. There is however one circum&s;tance, in which his conduct is vi&s;ibly different from that of his grandfather: He is not accu&s;ed of having impo&s;ed one arbitrary tax, without con&s;ent of parliament, during his whole reign<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We learn from Cotton, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">. that the King, by his chancellor, told the commons, <HI>that they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, and namely in forbearing to charge them with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ines and fifteens, the which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"></HI> no more <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">.</HI> The&s;e words, <HI>no more,</HI> allude to the practice of his predecessors: He had not him&s;elf impo&s;ed any arbitrary taxes: Even the parliament, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> of his depo&s;ition, tho' they complain of heavy taxes, affirm not, that they were impo&s;ed il|legally or by arbitrary will.</NOTE>: Scarce a year pa&s;&s;ed during the reign of Edward, which was free from complaints with regard to this grievous and dangerous exertion of authority. But, perhaps, the great a&s;cendant, which Edward had acquired over his people, to|gether with his great prudence, enabled him to make a u&s;e very advantageous to his &s;ubjects of this and other arbitrary prerogatives, and rendered them a &s;maller grievance in his hands, than a le&s;s ab&s;olute authority in tho&s;e of his grand&s;on. This is a point, which it would be ra&s;h for us to decide po&s;itively on either &s;ide; but it is certain, that a charge drawn up by the duke of Lanca&s;ter, and a&s;&s;ented to by a parliament, &s;ituated in the&s;e circum&s;tances, forms no manner of pre&s;ump|tion with regard to the unu&s;ual irregularity or violence of the King's conduct in this particular<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">To show how little credit is to be given to this charge again&s;t Richard, we may ob&s;erve, that a law in the 13 Edw.

this univer&s;al di&s;loyalty and violence, to appear in defence of his unhappy ma&s;ter, and to plead his cau&s;e again&s;t all the power of the prevailing party. Tho' &s;ome topics, employed by that virtuous prelate, may &s;eem to favour too much the doctrine of pa&s;&s;ive obedience, and to make too large a &s;acrifice of the rights of mankind; he was naturally pu&s;hed into that extreme by his abhorrence of the pre&s;ent licentious factions; and &s;uch intrepidity, as well as di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of behaviour, proves, that, whatever his &s;peculative principles were, his heart was elevated far above the meanne&s;s and abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of a &s;lave. He repre&s;ented to the parliament, that all the abu&s;es of government, which could ju&s;tly be im|puted to Richard, far from amounting to tyranny, were merely the re&s;ult of error, youth, or mi&s;guided council, and admitted of a remedy, more ea&s;y and &s;alutary, than a total &s;ubver&s;ion of the con&s;titution. That even had they been much more violent and dangerous than they really were, they had chiefly pro|ceeded from former examples of re&s;i&s;tance, which, making the prince &s;en|&s;ible of his precarious &s;ituation, had obliged him to e&s;tabli&s;h his throne by ir|regular and arbitrary expedients. That a rebellious di&s;po&s;ition in &s;ubjects was the principal cau&s;e of tyranny in Kings: Laws could never &s;ecure the &s;ubject, which did not give &s;ecurity to the &s;overeign: And if the maxim of inviolable loyalty, which formed the ba&s;is of the Engli&s;h government, were once rejected, the pri|vileges, belonging to the &s;everal orders of the &s;tate, in&s;tead of being fortified by that licentiou&s;ne&s;s, would thereby lo&s;e the &s;ure&s;t foundation of their force and &s;tability. That the parliamentary depo&s;ition of Edward II. far from making a precedent, which could controul this maxim, was only the example of &s;ucce&s;sful violence; and it was &s;ufficiently to be lamented, that crimes were &s;o often committed in the world, without e&s;tabli&s;hing principles which might ju&s;tify and authorize them. That even that precedent, fal&s;e and dangerous as it was, could never warrant the pre&s;ent exce&s;&s;es, which were &s;o much greater, and which would entail di&s;traction and mi&s;ery on the nation, to their late&s;t po&s;terity. That the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, at lea&s;t, of the crown, was then pre&s;erved inviolate: The lineal heir was placed on the throne: And the people had an opportunity, by their legal obedience to him, of making atonement for the violences which they had committed again&s;t his prede|ce&s;&s;or.

That the new government, intended to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, would &s;tand on no principles; and would &s;carce retain any pretence, by which it could challenge the obedience of men of &s;en&s;e or virtue.

And that the duke of Lanca&s;ter would give them but a bad &s;pecimen of the legal moderation, which might be expected from his future government, if he added, to the crime of his past rebellion, the guilt of excluding the family, which, both by right of blood, and by declaration of parliament, would, in ca&s;e of Richard's decea&s;e, or volun|tary re&s;ignation, have been received as the undoubted heirs of the monarchy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir John Heywarde, p. 101.</NOTE>.</P>

The ca&s;e is the &s;ame with regard to his right of conque&s;t: He was a &s;ubject who rebelled again&s;t his &s;overeign: He entered the kingdom with a reti|nue of no more than &s;ixty per&s;ons: He could not therefore be the conqueror of England; and this right is accordingly in&s;inuated, not avowed. Still there is a third claim, derived from his merits in &s;aving the nation from tyranny and oppre&s;|&s;ion; and this claim is al&s;o in&s;inuated: But as it &s;eemed, by its nature, better calculated as a rea&s;on for his being <HI>elected</HI> King by a free choice, which he was determined never to avow, than for giving him an immediate right of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he dur&s;t not &s;peak openly even on this head; and to obviate any notion of election, he challenges the crown as his due, either by acqui&s;ition or inheritance. The whole forms &s;uch a piece of jargon and non&s;en&s;e, as is almo&s;t without ex|ample: No objection however was made to it in the parliament: The unanimous voice of lords and commons placed Henry on the throne: He became King, no|body could tell how or wherefore: The title of the hou&s;e of Marche, formerly recognized by parliament, was neither invalidated nor repealed; but pa&s;&s;ed over in total &s;ilence: And as a concern for the liberties of the people &s;eems to have had no hand in this revolution, their right to di&s;po&s;e of the government, as well as all their other privileges, was left preci&s;ely on the &s;ame footing as before. But Henry, having, when he claimed the crown, dropped &s;ome ob&s;cure hint concern|ing conque&s;t, which, it was thought, might endanger the&s;e privileges, he &s;oon after made a public declaration, that he did not thereby intend to deprive any one of his franchi&s;es or liberties<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Knyghton, p. 2759.

But when the grandees were tempted, by his want of pru|dence and of vigour, to re&s;i&s;t his authority, and execute the mo&s;t violent enterprizes upon him, he was naturally led to &s;eek for an opportunity of retaliation; ju&s;tice was neglected; the lives of the chief nobility &s;acrificed; and all the&s;e evils &s;eem to have proceeded le&s;s from a &s;ettled de&s;ign of e&s;tabli&s;hing arbitrary power, than from the in&s;olence of victory, and the nece&s;&s;ities of the King's &s;ituation. The manners indeed of the age were the chief &s;ource of &s;uch violences: Laws, which were &s;eebly ob&s;erved in peaceable times, lo&s;t all their authority during public convul|&s;ions: Both parties were alike guilty: Or if any difference may be remarked be|tween them, we &s;hall find, that the authority of the crown, being more legal, was commonly carried, when it prevailed, to le&s;s de&s;perate extremities, than tho&s;e of the ari&s;tocracy.</P>
<P>ON comparing the conduct and events of this reign, with tho&s;e of the preced|ing, we &s;hall find equal rea&s;on to admire Edward, and to blame Richard; but the circum&s;tance of oppo&s;ition, &s;urely, will not lie in the &s;trict regard paid by the former to national privileges, and the neglect of them by the latter. On the contrary, the prince of &s;mall abilities, as he felt his want of power, &s;eems to have been always more moderate in this re&s;pect than the other. Every parliament, a&s;|&s;embled during the reign of Edward, remon&s;trate again&s;t the exertion of &s;ome arbitrary prerogative or other: We hear not any complaints of that kind during the reign of Richard, till the a&s;&s;embling of his la&s;t parliament, which was &s;um|moned by his inveterate enemies, which dethroned him, which framed their com|plaints during the time of the mo&s;t furious convul&s;ions, and who&s;e te&s;timony can therefore have, on that account, much le&s;s authority with every equitable judge<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Compare, in this view, the abridgement of the records, by &s;ir Robert Cotton, during the&s;e two reigns.</NOTE>. Both the&s;e princes experienced the encroachments of the Great upon their autho|rity. Edward, reduced to nece&s;&s;ities, was obliged to make an expre&s;s bargain with his parliament, and to &s;ell &s;ome of his prerogatives for pre&s;ent &s;upply; but as they were acquainted with his genius and capacity, they ventured not to de|mand any exorbitant conce&s;&s;ions, or &s;uch as were incompatible with regal and &s;overeign power: The weakne&s;s of Richard tempted the parliament to extort a commi&s;&s;ion, which in a manner dethroned the prince, and transferred the &s;ceptre into the hands of the nobility. The events were al&s;o &s;uitable to the character of each. Edward had no &s;ooner got the &s;upply, than he departed from the engagements, which had induced the parliament to grant it; he openly

told his people, that he had but <HI>di&s;&s;embled</HI> with them when he &s;eemed to make them the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions; and he re&s;umed and retained all his prerogatives. But Richard, becau&s;e he was detected in con&s;ulting and deliberating with the judges on the lawfulne&s;s of re&s;toring the con&s;titution, found his barons immediately in arms again&s;t him; was deprived of his liberty; &s;aw his favourites, his mini&s;ters, his tutor, butchered before his face, or bani&s;hed and attainted; and was obliged to give way to all this violence. There cannot be a more remarkable oppo&s;ition between the fortunes of two princes: It were happy for &s;ociety, that this oppo&s;i|tion depended always on the ju&s;tice or inju&s;tice of the mea&s;ures which men em|brace; and not rather on the different degrees of prudence and vigour, with which the&s;e mea&s;ures are &s;upported.</P>

<P>THE aver&s;ion entertained again&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;hed church &s;oon found principles and tenets, and rea&s;onings, by which it could ju&s;tify and &s;upport it&s;elf. John Wickliffe, a &s;ecular prie&s;t, educated at Oxford, began, in the latter end of Ed|ward III. to &s;pread the doctrines of reformation by his di&s;cour&s;es, &s;ermons, and writings; and he made many di&s;ciples among men of all ranks and &s;tations. He &s;eems to have been a man of parts and learning; and has the honour of being the fir&s;t per&s;on in Europe, who publickly called in que&s;tion tho&s;e doctrines, which had univer&s;ally pa&s;&s;ed for certain and undi&s;puted during &s;o many ages.
<PB N="277" REF="285">
Wickliffe him&s;elf, as well as his di&s;ciples, who received the name of Wicklif|fites or Lollards, was di&s;tingui&s;hed by a remarkable au&s;terity of life and man|ners; a circum&s;tance common to almo&s;t all tho&s;e who dogmatize in any new way, both becau&s;e men, who draw to them the attention of the public, and expo&s;e them|&s;elves to the odium of great multitudes, are obliged to be very guarded in their conduct, and becau&s;e few, who have a &s;trong propen&s;ity to plea&s;ure or bu&s;ine&s;s, will enter upon &s;o difficult and laborious an undertaking. The doctrines of Wickliffe, being derived from his &s;earch into the &s;criptures and into eccle&s;ia&s;tical antiquity, were nearly the &s;ame with tho&s;e propagated by the reformers in the &s;ixteenth century: He only carried &s;ome of them farther than was done by the more &s;ober part of the&s;e reformers. He denied the doctrine of the real pre&s;ence, the &s;upremacy of the church of Rome, the merit of mona&s;tic vows: He main|tained, that the &s;cripture was the &s;ole rule of faith; that the church was depen|dant on the &s;tate, and ought to be reformed by it; that the clergy ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s no e&s;tates; that the begging friars were a general nui&s;ance, and ought not to be &s;upported<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p. 191, 208, 283, 284. Spelman concil. vol. 2. p. 630.

From the whole of his doctrines, Wickliffe appears to have been &s;trongly tinctured with enthu&s;ia&s;m, and to have been thereby the better qualified to oppo&s;e a church, who&s;e di&s;tingui&s;h|ing character was &s;uper&s;tition.</P>
<P>THE propagation of the&s;e principles gave great alarm to the clergy; and a bull was i&s;&s;ued by Pope Gregory XI. for taking Wickliffe into cu&s;tody, and examining into the &s;cope of his opinions<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Spelm. conc. vol. 2. p. 621. Wal&s;ingham, p. 201, 202, 203.</NOTE>. Courteney, bi&s;hop of London, cited him before his tribunal; but the reformer had now got very powerful protec|tors, who &s;creened him from the eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction. The duke of Lan|ca&s;ter, who then governed the kingdom, encouraged the principles of Wickliffe; and he made no &s;cruple, as well as lord Piercy, the mare&s;chal, to appear openly in court with him, in order to give him countenance upon his trial: He even in|&s;i&s;ted, that Wickliffe &s;hould &s;it in the bi&s;hop's pre&s;ence, while his principles were examined: Courtney exclaimed again&s;t this in&s;ult: The mob of London, thinking their prelate affronted, attacked the duke and mare&s;chal, who e&s;caped from their hands with &s;ome difficulty<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Harpsfield in Hi&s;t.

<P>THE duke of Lanca&s;ter, however, &s;till continued his protection to Wickliffe, during the minority of Richard; and the principles of that reformer had &s;o far propagated them&s;elves, that when the Pope &s;ent to Oxford a new bull again&s;t the&s;e doctrines, the univer&s;ity deliberated for &s;ome time, whether they &s;hould receive the bull; and they never took any vigorous mea&s;ures in con&s;equence of the papal orders<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wood's Ant.

Even the populace of London were at length brought to entertain favourable &s;entiments of this reformer: When he was cited before a &s;ynod at Lambeth, the mob broke into the a&s;&s;embly, and &s;o overawed the prelates, who found both the people and the court again&s;t them, that they di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him with|out any farther cen&s;ures.</P>

But there was hitherto no law in England, by which the &s;ecular arm was empower|ed to &s;upport orthodoxy; and the eccle&s;ia&s;tics endeavoured to &s;upply the defect by a very extraordinary and very unwarrantable artifice. In the year 1381, there was an act pa&s;&s;ed, enjoining &s;heriffs to apprehend the preachers of here&s;y and their abettors; but this &s;tatute had been &s;urreptitiou&s;ly obtained by the cler|gy, and had the formality of an enrolment without the con&s;ent of the commons.

The court of Rome had fallen upon a new device, which encrea&s;ed their authority over the prelates: The Pope, who found that the expedient of arbitrarily depriving them was violent and liable to oppo&s;ition, attained the &s;ame end by transferring &s;uch of them, as were obnoxious, to poorer &s;ees, and even to nominal &s;ees, <HI>in partibus infidelium.</HI> It was thus that the archbi&s;hop of York, and the bi&s;hops of Durham and Chiche&s;|ter, the King's mini&s;ters, had been treated after the prevalence of Gloce&s;ter's faction: The good bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le met with the &s;ame fate after the acce&s;&s;ion of Henry IV.

But this circum&s;tance, tho' it weakened the papal authority, had not &s;o great an effect as might naturally be imagined. Tho' any King could ea&s;ily, at fir&s;t, make his kingdom embrace the party of one Pope or the other, or even keep it &s;ome time in &s;u&s;pence between them, he could not &s;o ea&s;ily transfer his obedience at plea&s;ure: The people attached them&s;elves to their own party as to a religious opinion; and conceived an extreme abhorrence to the oppo&s;ite party, whom they regarded at little better than Saracens or infidels. Croi&s;ades were even undertaken in this quarrel; and the zealous bi&s;hop of Norwich, in parti|cular, led over, in 1382, near 60,000 bigots into Flanders again&s;t the Clementines; but after lo&s;ing a great part of his followers, he returned with di&s;grace into Eng|land<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, lib. 2. chap. 133, 134.

Each Pope, &s;en&s;ible, from this prevailing &s;pirit of the people, that the kingdom, which once embraced his cau&s;e, would always adhere to him, boldly maintained all the preten&s;ions of his &s;ee, and &s;tood not much more in awe of the &s;overeigns, than if his authority had not been endangered by a rival.</P>

<PB N="281" REF="289">
and vigilant reign of Edward III. that no &s;ubject could tru&s;t to their protection. Men openly a&s;&s;ociated them&s;elves, under the patronage of &s;ome great man, for their mutual defence. They had public badges by which their confederacy was di&s;tingui&s;hed. They &s;upported each other in all quarrels, iniquities, extortions, murders, robberies, and other crimes. Their chieftain was more their &s;overeign than the King him&s;elf; and their own band was more connected with them than their country. Hence the perpetual turbulence, di&s;orders, factions, and civil wars of tho&s;e times: Hence the &s;mall regard paid to a character or the opinion of the public: Hence the large di&s;cretionary prerogatives of the crown, and the danger which might have en&s;ued from the too great limitation of them. If the King had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no arbitrary powers, while all the nobles a&s;&s;umed and exerci&s;ed them, there mu&s;t have en&s;ued an ab&s;olute anarchy in the &s;tate.</P>
<P>ONE great mi&s;chief, attending the&s;e confederacies, was the extorting from the King pardons for the mo&s;t enormous crimes. The parliament often endeavoured, in the la&s;t reign, to deprive the prince of this prerogative; but in the pre&s;ent, they were contented with an abridgement of it. They enacted, that no pardon for rapes or murder from malice prepen&s;e &s;hould be valid, unle&s;s the crime was particularly &s;pecified in it<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">13 Rich. II. Chap. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>. There were al&s;o &s;ome other circum&s;tances required for the pa&s;&s;ing any pardons of this kind: An excellent law; but ill ob&s;erved, like mo&s;t laws, which thwart the manners of the people, and the prevailing cu&s;toms of the times.</P>
<P>IT is ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, from the&s;e voluntary a&s;&s;ociations among the people, that the whole force of the feudal &s;y&s;tem was in a manner di&s;&s;olved, and that the Engli&s;h had nearly returned in that particular to the &s;ame &s;ituation in which they &s;tood before the Norman conque&s;t. It was indeed impo&s;&s;ible, that that &s;y&s;tem could long &s;ub&s;i&s;t, under the con&s;tant revolutions, to which landed property is every where &s;ubject. When the great feudal baronies were fir&s;t erected, the lord lived in opulence in the mid&s;t of his va&s;&s;als: He was in a &s;ituation to protect and cheri&s;h and defend them: The quality of patron naturally united it&s;elf to that of &s;uperior: And the&s;e two principles of authority mutually &s;upported each other. But when, by the various divi&s;ions and mixtures of property, a man's &s;uperior came to live at a di&s;tance from him, and could no longer give him &s;helter or countenance; the tie gradually became more fictitious than real: New connexions from neighbourhood or other cau&s;es were formed: Protection was &s;ought by vo|luntary &s;ervices and attachment: The appearance of valor, &s;pirit, ability in any great man extended his intere&s;t very far: And if the &s;overeign was deficient in the&s;e
<PB N="282" REF="290">
qualities, he was equally, if not more expo&s;ed to the u&s;urpations of the ari&s;to|cracy than even during the vigor of the feudal &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>THE greate&s;t novelty introduced into the civil government during this reign was the creation of peers by patent. The lord Beauchamp of Holt was the fir&s;t peer, who was advanced to the hou&s;e of lords in this manner. The practice of levying benevolences is al&s;o fir&s;t mentioned in this reign.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1399" UNIT="year"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">tle of the King.</NOTE> THE Engli&s;h had &s;o long been familiarized to the hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of their monarchy, the in&s;tances of departure from it had always born &s;uch &s;trong &s;ymptoms of inju&s;tice and violence, and &s;o little of a national choice or elec|tion, and the returns to the true line had ever been deemed &s;uch fortunate in|cidents in their hi&s;tory, that Henry was afraid, le&s;t, in re&s;ting his title on the con&s;ent of the people, he &s;hould build on a foundation, to which the people them&s;elves were not accu&s;tomed, and who&s;e &s;olidity they would with difficulty be brought to recognize. The idea too of choice &s;eemed always to imply that of conditions, and a liberty of recalling the con&s;ent upon any &s;uppo&s;ed violation of them; an idea which was not naturally agreeable to a &s;overeign, and might be dangerous to the people them&s;elves, who, lying &s;o much under the influence of turbulent nobles, had ever paid but a very imperfect obedience even to their he|reditary princes. For the&s;e rea&s;ons Henry was determined never to have recour&s;e to this claim; the only one, on which his authority could con&s;i&s;tently &s;tand: He cho&s;e rather to patch up his title in the be&s;t manner he could from other preten&s;ions: And in the end, he left him&s;elf, in the eyes of men of &s;en&s;e, no foundation of right, but his pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; a very precarious claim, which,
<PB N="283" REF="291">
by its very nature, was liable to be overthrown by every faction of the great, or prejudice of the people. He had indeed a pre&s;ent advantage over his compe|titor: The heir of the hou&s;e of Mortimer, who had been declared in parliament the true heir of the crown, was a boy of &s;even years of age<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, vol. i. p. 151.</NOTE>: His friends con|&s;ulted his &s;afety by keeping &s;ilence with regard to his title: Henry detained him and his younger brother in an honourable cu&s;tody at Wind&s;or ca&s;tle: But he had rea&s;on to dread, that, in proportion as that nobleman grew to man's e&s;tate, he would draw to him the attachment of the people, and make them reflect on the fraud, violence, and inju&s;tice, by which he had been excluded from the throne. Many favourable topics would occur in his behalf: He was born in the country; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an exten&s;ive intere&s;t from the greatne&s;s and alliances of his family; how|ever criminal the depo&s;ed monarch might be, this youth was entirely innocent; he was of the &s;ame religion, and educated in the &s;ame manners with the people, and could not be governed by any &s;eparate intere&s;t: The&s;e views would all con|cur to favour his claim; and tho' the abilities of the pre&s;ent prince might ward off any dangerous revolution, it was ju&s;tly to be apprehended, that his authority could with difficulty be brought to equal that of his predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>HENRY in his very fir&s;t parliament had rea&s;on to &s;ee the danger attending that &s;tation, which he had a&s;&s;umed, and the ob&s;tacles, which he would meet with, in governing an unruly ari&s;tocracy, always divided by faction, and &s;till more inflamed with the re&s;entments, con&s;equent on &s;uch recent convul&s;ions. The peers on their a&s;&s;embling broke out into violent animo&s;ities; forty gauntlets, the gages of furious battle, were thrown on the floor of the hou&s;e of lords by noble|men who gave mutual challenges to each other; and <HI>liar</HI> and <HI>traitor</HI> re&s;ounded from all quarters. The King had &s;o much authority with the&s;e doughty cham|pions, as to prevent all the combats, which they threatened; but he was not able to bring them to a proper compo&s;ure, or to an amicable di&s;po&s;ition towards each other.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="year"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">An in&s;ur|rection.</NOTE> IT was not long before the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions broke out in action.

appeared, next day, at King&s;ton upon Thames, at the head of 20,000 men, mo&s;tly drawn from the city; and his enemies, unable to re&s;i&s;t his power, di&s;per&s;ed them|&s;elves, with a view of rai&s;ing their followers in the &s;everal counties, which were the &s;eat of their intere&s;t. But the adherents of the King were hot in the pur&s;uit, and every where oppo&s;ed them&s;elves to their progre&s;s. The earls of Kent and Sali&s;bury were &s;eized at Cirence&s;ter by the citizens; and were next day beheaded without farther ceremony, according to the cu&s;tom of the times<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p. 363.

The earl of Huntington, &s;ir Thomas Blount, Sir Benedict Sely, who were al&s;o taken pri&s;oners, &s;uffered death, with many others of the con&s;pirators, by orders from Henry. And when the quarters of the&s;e un|happy men were brought to London, no le&s;s than eighteen bi&s;hops and thirty|four mitred abbots, joined the populace, and met them with the mo&s;t indecent marks of joy and exultation.</P>
<P>BUT the &s;pectacle the mo&s;t &s;hocking to every one, who retained any &s;enti|ment either of honour or humanity, &s;till remained. The earl of Rutland appeared, carrying on a pole the head of lord Spencer, his brother-in-law, which he pre|&s;ented in triumph to Henry, as a te&s;timony of his loyalty. This infamous man, who was &s;oon after duke of York by the death of his father, and fir&s;t prince of the blood, had been in&s;trumental in the murder of his uncle, the duke of Glo|ce&s;ter<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, vol. ii. p. 171.</NOTE>; had then de&s;erted Richard, by whom he was tru&s;ted; had con&s;pired again&s;t the life of Henry to whom he had &s;worn allegiance; had betrayed his a&s;|&s;ociates, whom he had &s;educed into this enterprize; and now di&s;played, in the face of the world, the&s;e badges of his multiplied di&s;honour.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1401" UNIT="year"> HENRY was &s;en&s;ible, that, tho' the execution of the&s;e con&s;pirators might &s;eem to give &s;ecurity to his throne, the animo&s;ities, which remain after &s;uch bloody &s;cenes, are always dangerous to royal authority; and he therefore determined not to encrea&s;e, by any hazardous enterprize, tho&s;e numerous enemies, with whom he was every where &s;urrounded. While he was only a &s;ubject, he was believed to have &s;trongly imbibed all the principles of his father, the duke of Lanca&s;ter, and to have adopted the prejudices which the Lollards in&s;pired again&s;t the abu&s;es of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church: But finding him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the throne by &s;o precarious a title, he thought &s;uperstition a very nece&s;&s;ary implement of public authority; and he re&s;olved, by every expedient, to pay court to the clergy. There were hitherto no penal laws enacted again&s;t here&s;y; an indulgence which had nowi&s;e proceeded from a &s;pirit of toleration in the Romi&s;h church, but from the ignorance and
<PB N="285" REF="293">
&s;implicity of the people, which had rendered them unfit either for &s;tarting or re|ceiving any new or curious doctrines, and which needed not to be re&s;trained by any rigorous puni&s;hments. But when the learning and genius of Wickliffe had once broke the fetters of prejudice, the eccle&s;ia&s;tics called aloud for the puni&s;hment of his di&s;ciples; and the King, who was very little &s;crupulous in his conduct, was ea&s;ily induced to &s;acrifice his principles to his intere&s;t, and to acquire the favour of the church by that mo&s;t effectual method, the gratifying their vengeance again&s;t all opponents. He engaged the parliament to pa&s;s a law for this purpo&s;e, and it was enacted, that when any heretic, who relap&s;ed or refu&s;ed to abjure his opinions, was delivered over to the &s;ecular arm by the bi&s;hop or his commi&s;|&s;aries, he &s;hould be committed to the flames by the civil magi&s;trate before the whole people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Hen. IV. chap. 7.</NOTE>. This weapon did not remain long unemployed in the hands of the clergy: William Sautre, rector of St. O&s;ithes in London, had been con|demned by the convocation of Canterbury; his &s;entence was ratified by the hou&s;e of peers; the King i&s;&s;ued his writ for the execution<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 8. p. 178.</NOTE>; and the unhappy man attoned for his erroneous opinions by the penalty of fire. This is the fir&s;t in|&s;tance of that kind in England; and thus one horror more was added to tho&s;e di&s;mal &s;cenes, which at that time were already but too familiar to the people.</P>
<P>BUT the utmo&s;t precaution and prudence of Henry could not &s;hield him from tho&s;e numerous inquietudes, which a&s;&s;ailed him from every quarter. The con|nexions of Richard with the royal family of France, made that court exert its activity to recover his authority, or revenge his death<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 8. p. 123.</NOTE>; but tho' the confu&s;ions of England, tempted the French to undertake &s;ome enterprize, by which they might di&s;tre&s;s their antient enemy, the greater confu&s;ions, which they experienced at home, obliged them quickly to accommodate matters; and Charles, content with recovering his daughter from Henry's hands, laid a&s;ide his preparations, and renewed the truce between the two kingdoms<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 8. p. 142, 152, 219.</NOTE>. The attack of Guienne was al&s;o an inviting attempt, which the pre&s;ent factions, that prevailed among the French, obliged them to neglect. The Ga&s;cons, affectionate to the memory of Richard, who had been born among them, refu&s;ed to &s;wear allegiance to a prince that had u&s;urped his throne, and murdered his per&s;on; and the appearance of a French army on their frontiers, would probably have tempted them to change ma&s;ters<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 8. 110, 111.</NOTE>. But the earl of Worce&s;ter, arriving with &s;ome Engli&s;h troops, gave countenance to the partizans of England, and over-awed their opponents. Religion too was here found a cement of their union with that kingdom. The Ga&s;|cons had been engaged by Richard's authority to acknowledge the Pope of Rome;
<PB N="286" REF="294">
and they were &s;en&s;ible, that if they &s;ubmitted to France, it would be nece&s;&s;ary for them to pay obedience to the Pope of Avignon, whom they had been taught to dete&s;t as a &s;chi&s;matic.

<P>THE uncertainty in which Henry's affairs &s;tood for a long time with France, as well as the confu&s;ion, incident to all great changes in government, tempted the Scots to make incur&s;ions into England; and Henry, de&s;irous of taking re|venge upon them, but afraid of rendering his new government unpopular by requiring great &s;upplies from his &s;ubjects, &s;ummoned at We&s;tmin&s;ter a council of the peers, without the commons, and laid before them the &s;tate of his affairs<NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 8. p. 125, 126.</NOTE>.

He complained of the cruel policy, in allowing the young earl of Marche, whom he ought to regard as his &s;overeign, to remain a captive in the hands of his enemies, and in even refu&s;ing to all his friends permi&s;&s;ion to treat of his ran&s;om. He charged him again with perjury in loading the nation with heavy taxes, after having &s;worn that, without the utmo&s;t nece&s;&s;ity, he would neverlevy any impo&s;itions upon them.

The earl of Nottingham, &s;on to the duke of Norfolk, and the archbi&s;hop of York, brother to the earl of Wilt&s;hire, whom Henry, then duke of Lanca&s;ter, had beheaded at Bri&s;tol, tho' they had remained quiet, while Piercy was in the field, &s;till harboured in their brea&s;t a violent hatred again&s;t the enemy of their families; and they determined, in conjunction with the earl of North|umberland, to &s;eek revenge again&s;t him. They betook them&s;elves to arms before that powerful nobleman was prepared to join them; and publi&s;hing a manife&s;to, in which they reproached Henry with his u&s;urpation of the crown and the murder of the late King, they required, that the right line &s;hould be re&s;tored, and all public grievances be redre&s;&s;ed. The earl of We&s;tmoreland, who&s;e power lay in the neighbourhood, approached them with an inferior force at Shipton near York; and being afraid to hazard a battle, he attempted to &s;ubdue them by an artifice, which nothing but the greate&s;t &s;olly and &s;implicity on their part could have rendered &s;ucce&s;sful. He de&s;ired a conference with the archbi&s;hop and earl between the two armies: He heard their grievances with great patience: He begged them to propo&s;e the remedies: He approved of every thing which they &s;ugge&s;ted: He granted them all their demands: He al&s;o engaged that Henry &s;hould give them entire &s;atisfaction: And when he &s;aw them plea&s;ed with the facility of his conce&s;&s;ions, he ob&s;erved to them, that, &s;ince amity was now in ef|fect re&s;tored between them, it were better on both &s;ides to di&s;mi&s;s their forces, which otherwi&s;e would prove an in&s;upportable burthen to the country. The archbi&s;hop and the earl of Nottingham immediately i&s;&s;ued orders to that purpo&s;e: Their troops di&s;banded upon the field: But We&s;tmoreland, who had &s;ecretly i&s;|&s;ued contrary orders to <HI>his</HI> army, &s;eized the two rebels without re&s;i&s;tance, and carried them to the King, who was advancing with ha&s;ty marches to &s;uppre&s;s the rebellion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p. 373.

The trial and puni&s;hment of an archbi&s;hop might have proved a very trouble&s;ome and dangerous undertaking, had Henry proceeded regularly, and allowed time for an oppo&s;ition to form it&s;elf again&s;t that unu&s;ual mea&s;ure. The celerity of the execution alone could here render it &s;afe and prudent. Finding that Sir William Ga&s;coigne, the chief ju&s;tice, made &s;ome &s;cruple of acting on this occa&s;ion, he appointed Sir William Fulthorpe a judge for that purpo&s;e; who, without any indictment, trial or defence, pronounced &s;entence of death upon the prelate, which was in&s;tantly executed. This was the fir&s;t in&s;tance in England of a capital puni&s;hment inflicted on a bi&s;hop; whence the clergy of that rank might learn, that their crimes, as well as tho&s;e of Laics, were not to pa&s;s with impuni|ty.

The earl of Nottingham was condemned and executed in the &s;ame &s;um|mary manner: But tho' many other per&s;ons of condition, &s;uch as the lord Fal|conberge, Sir Ralph Ha&s;tings, Sir John Colville, were engaged in this rebellion, no more &s;eem to have fallen victims to Henry's &s;everity.</P>
<P>THE earl of Northumberland, on receiving this intelligence, fled into Scot|land, together with lord Bardolf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p. 374.</NOTE>; and the King, without oppo&s;ition, reduced all the ca&s;tles and fortre&s;&s;es, belonging to the&s;e noblemen.

Chron. Otterb. p. 261.</NOTE>. This pro&s;perous event, joined to the death of Glendour, which happened &s;oon after, freed Henry from all his dome&s;|tic enemies; and this prince, who had mounted the throne by &s;uch unju&s;tifi|able methods, and held it by &s;uch an exceptionable title, had yet, by his valour, prudence, and addre&s;s, accu&s;tomed his people to the yoke, and had obtained a greater a&s;cendant over his haughty barons, than the law alone, not &s;upported by the&s;e active qualities, was ever able to confer.</P>
<P>ABOUT the &s;ame time, fortune gave Henry an advantage over that neighbour, who, by his &s;ituation, was be&s;t enabled to di&s;turb his government. Robert the third King of Scots, was a prince, tho' of &s;lender capacity, extremely innocent and inoffen&s;ive in his conduct: But Scotland, &s;till le&s;s than England, was at that time fitted for cheri&s;hing, or even enduring, &s;overeigns of that character. The duke of Albany, Robert's brother, a prince of more abilities, at lea&s;t of a more boi&s;terous and violent di&s;po&s;ition, had a&s;&s;umed the government of the &s;tate; and not &s;atisfied with pre&s;ent authority, he entertained the criminal purpo&s;e of ex|tirpating his brother's children, and of acquiring the crown to his own family. He threw in pri&s;on David, his elde&s;t nephew; who there peri&s;hed with hunger: James alone, the younger brother of David, &s;tood between that tyrant and the throne; and King Robert, &s;en&s;ible of his &s;on's danger, embarked him on board a &s;hip, with a view of &s;ending him into France, and entru&s;ting him to the pro|tection of that friendly power. Unfortunately, the ve&s;&s;el was taken by the En|gli&s;h; prince James, a boy about nine years of age, was carried to London;
<PB N="292" REF="300">
and tho' there &s;ub&s;i&s;ted a truce at that time between the two kingdoms, Henry con+&s;tantly refu&s;ed to re&s;tore the young prince to his liberty. Robert, worn out with cites and infirmities, was unable to bear the &s;hock of this la&s;t misfortune; and he &s;oon after died, leaving the government in the hands of the duke of Albany<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE>. Henry was now more &s;en&s;ible than ever of the importance of the acqui&s;ition, which he had made: While he retained &s;uch a pledge in his hands, he was &s;ure of keep|ing the duke of Albany in dependance; or if offended, he could ea&s;ily, by re&s;tor|ing the true heir, take ample revenge upon the u&s;urper. But tho' the King, by detaining James in the Engli&s;h court, had &s;hown him&s;elf &s;omewhat deficient in genero&s;ity, he made ample amends by giving that prince an excellent educa|tion, which afterwards qualified him, when he mounted the throne, to reform, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the rude and barbarous manners of his native country.</P>
<P>THE ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;itions, which always prevailed between France and Eng|land, were re&s;trained, during the greate&s;t part of this reign, from appearing in action. The jealou&s;ies and civil commotions, with which both nations was di&s;|turbed, kept each of them from taking advantage of the unhappy &s;ituation of its neighbour. But as the abilities and good fortune of Henry had been able &s;ooner to compo&s;e the Engli&s;h factions, this prince began, in the latter part of his reign, to look abroad, and to foment the animo&s;ities between the families of Burgundy and Orleans, by which the government of France was, during that period, &s;o much di&s;tracted. He knew, that one great &s;ource of the national di&s;content again&s;t his predece&s;&s;or was the inactivity of his reign; and he hoped, by giving a new di|rection to the re&s;tle&s;s and unquiet &s;pirits of his people, to prevent their breaking out in dome&s;tic wars and di&s;orders. <MILESTONE N="1411" UNIT="year"> That he might join policy to force, he fir&s;t entered into treaty with the duke of Burgundy, and &s;ent that prince a &s;mall body of troops, which &s;upported him again&s;t his enemies<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p. 380.</NOTE>.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> SUCH were the military and foreign tran&s;actions of this reign: The civil and parliamentary are &s;omewhat more memorable; and more worthy of our attention.

unwarrantable methods for procuring to his partizans a &s;eat in that hou&s;e. This practice formed one con&s;iderable article of charge again&s;t him in his depo|&s;ition; yet Henry &s;crupled not to tread in his foot&s;teps, and to encourage the &s;ame abu&s;es in elections. Laws were enacted again&s;t &s;uch undue influence, and even a &s;heriff was puni&s;hed for an iniquitous return, which he had made<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">.</NOTE>: But laws commonly were, at that time, very ill executed; and the liberties of the people, &s;uch as they were, &s;tood on a &s;urer ba&s;is than on laws and parliamentary elections. Tho' the hou&s;e of commons was little able to with&s;tand the violent currents, which perpetually ran between the monarchy and the ari&s;tocracy, and that hou&s;e might ea&s;ily be brought, at a particular time, to make the mo&s;t unwarran|table conce&s;&s;ions to either; the general in&s;titutions of the &s;tate &s;till remained invariable; the intere&s;ts of the &s;everal members continued on the &s;ame footing; the &s;word was in the hands of the &s;ubject; and the government, tho' thrown into temporary di&s;orders, &s;oon &s;ettled it&s;elf on its antient foundations.</P>
<P>DURING the greate&s;t part of this reign, the King was obliged to court popu|larity; and the hou&s;e of commons, &s;en&s;ible of their own importance, began to a&s;&s;ume powers, which had not u&s;ually been exerci&s;ed by their predece&s;&s;ors.

But the great authority of the commons was but a temporary advantage ari&s;ing from the pre&s;ent &s;ituation. In a &s;ub&s;equent parliament, when the &s;peaker made

his cu&s;tomary applications to the throne for liberty of &s;peech, the King, hav|ing now overcome all his dome&s;tic difficulties, plainly told him, that he would have no novelties introduced, and would enjoy his prerogatives. But on the whole, the limitations of the government &s;eem to have been more &s;en&s;ibly felt, and more carefully maintained by Henry than by any of his predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>DURING this reign, when the hou&s;e of commons were, at any time, brought to make unwary conce&s;&s;ions to the crown, they al&s;o &s;howed their freedom by a very &s;peedy retractation of them. Henry, tho' he entertained a perpetual and well-grounded jealou&s;y of the family of Mortimer, allowed not their name to be once mentioned in parliament; and as none of the rebels had ventured to declare the earl of Marche King, he never attempted to procure, what would not have been refu&s;ed him, an expre&s;s declaration again&s;t the claim of that nobleman; becau&s;e he knew that &s;uch a declaration, in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, would have no authority, and would only &s;erve to revive the memory of Mortimer's title in the minds of the people He proceeded in his purpo&s;e after a more artful and covert manner. He procured a &s;ettlement of the crown on him&s;elf and his heirs|ma e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 454.</NOTE>, thereby tacitely excluding the females, and transferring the Salic law to the Engli&s;h government. He thought, that, tho' the hou&s;e of Plantagenet had at fir&s;t derived their title from females, this was a remote event, unknown to the genera ity of the people; and if he could once accu&s;tom the nation to the practice of excluding women, the title of the earl of Marche would gradually be forgot and neglected by them. But he was very unfortunate in this attempt. During the long conte&s;ts with France, the inju&s;tice of the Salic law had been &s;o much ex|claimed again&s;t by the nation, that a contrary principle had taken deep root in the minds of men, and it was now become impo&s;&s;ible to eradicate it. The &s;ame hou&s;e of commons, therefore, in a &s;ub&s;equent &s;e&s;&s;ion, apprehen&s;ive that they had overturned the foundations of the Engli&s;h government, and that they had opened the door to more civil wars than might en&s;ue even from the irregular advancement of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, applied with &s;uch earne&s;tne&s;s for a new &s;ettlement of the crown, that Henry yielded to their reque&s;t, and agreed to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the prince&s;&s;es of his family<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 8. p. 462.</NOTE>. A certain proof, that no-body was, in his heart, &s;atisfied with the King's title to the crown, or knew on what principle to re&s;t it.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the commons, during this reign, &s;howed a very laudable zeal for liberty in their tran&s;actions with the crown; their efforts again&s;t the church were &s;till more extraordinary, and &s;eemed to anticipate very much on the &s;pirit which be|came &s;o general in little more than a century afterwards. I know, that the credit

of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages re&s;ts entirely on one antient hi&s;torian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham.</NOTE>; but that hi&s;torian was contemporary, was a churchman, and it was contrary to the intere&s;ts of his order to pre&s;erve the memory of &s;uch tran&s;actions, much more to forge precedents, which po&s;terity might, &s;ome time, be tempted to imitate. This is a truth &s;o evident, that the mo&s;t likely way of accounting for the &s;ilence of the records on this head, is by &s;uppo&s;ing, that the authority of &s;ome churchmen was &s;o great as to procure a razure, with regard to the&s;e circum&s;tances, which the indi&s;cretion of one of that order has happily pre&s;erved to us.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ixth of Henry, the commons, who had been required to grant &s;upplies, propo&s;ed in plain terms to the King, that he &s;hould &s;eize all the temporalities of the church, and employ them as a perpetual fund to &s;erve the exigencies of the &s;tate. They in&s;i&s;ted, that the clergy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a third of the lands of the kingdom; that they contributed nothing to the &s;upport of the public burdens; and that their exorbi|tant riches tended only to di&s;qualify them for performing their mini&s;terial func|tions with proper zeal and attention. When this addre&s;s was pre&s;ented, the arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury, who then attended the King, objected, that the clergy, tho' they went not in per&s;on to the wars, &s;ent their va&s;&s;als and tenants in all ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity; while at the &s;ame time, they them&s;elves, who &s;taid at home, were employed, night and day, in offering up their prayers for the happine&s;s and pro&s;perity of the &s;tate. The &s;peaker &s;miled, and replied without re&s;erve, that he thought the prayers of the church but a very &s;lender &s;upply. The archbi&s;hop, however, prevailed in the di&s;pute: The Ki g di&s;couraged the application of the commons: And the lords rejected the bill which the lower hou&s;e had framed for de&s;poiling the church of her revenues<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p. 371. Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 563.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE commons were not di&s;couraged by this repul&s;e: In the eleventh of the King they returned to the charge with more zeal than before: They made a calculation of all the eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues, which, by their account, amounted to 485 000 marks a year, and included 18,400 ploughs of land. They pro|po&s;ed to divide this riches among fifteen new earls, 1500 knights, 6000 e&s;quires, and a hundred ho&s;pitals; be&s;ides 20,000 pounds a-year which the King might take for his own u&s;e: And they in&s;i&s;ted, that the clerical functions would be better performed than at pre&s;ent, by 15,000 pari&s;h prie&s;ts, at the rate of &s;even marks a piece of yearly &s;tipend<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p 379.

His health declined vi&s;ibly &s;ome months before his death: He was &s;ubject to fits, which bereaved him, for the time, of his &s;en&s;es: And tho' he was yet in the flower of his age, his end was vi|&s;ibly approaching. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">th March.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and character of the King.</NOTE> THE great popularity, which Henry enjoyed before he attained the crown, and which had &s;o much aided him in the acqui&s;ition of it, was entirely lo&s;t many years be|fore the end of his reign; and he governed his people more by terror than by affection, more by his own policy than by their &s;en&s;e of duty or allegiance. When men came to reflect in cool blood on the crimes which had led him to the throne; the rebellion again&s;t his prince; the depo&s;ition of a lawful King guilty &s;ometimes perhaps of oppre&s;&s;ion, but more frequently of imprudences; the exclu|&s;ion of the true heir; the murder of his &s;overeign and near relation; the&s;e were &s;uch enormities as drew on him the hatred of his &s;ubjects, &s;anctified all the rebel|lions again&s;t him, and made the executions, tho' not remarkably &s;evere, which he found nece&s;&s;ary for the maintenance of his authority, appear cruel as well as iniqui|tous to the people. Yet without pretending to apologize for the&s;e crimes, which mu&s;t ever be held in dete&s;tation, it may be remarked, that he was in&s;en&s;ibly led into this blameable conduct by a train of incidents, which few men po&s;&s;e&s;s virtue enough to with&s;tand. The inju&s;tice with which his predece&s;&s;or had treated him, in fir&s;t condemning him to bani&s;hment, and then de&s;poiling him of his patrimony, made him naturally think of revenge, and of recovering his lo&s;t rights; the headlong zeal of the people hurried him into the throne; the care of his own &s;ecurity, as well as his ambition, made him an u&s;urper; and the &s;teps have always been &s;o few between the pri&s;ons of princes and their graves, that we need not wonder if Richard's fate was no exception to the general rule. All the&s;e con&s;iderations make Henry's &s;ituation, if he retained any &s;en&s;e of virtue, very much to be lamented; and the inquietude with which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his envied great|ne&s;s, and the remor&s;es, by which it is &s;aid he was continually haunted, render him

an object of our pity, even when &s;eated upon the throne. But it mu&s;t be owned, that his prudence and vigilance and fore&s;ight, in maintaining his power, were ad|mirable: His command of temper remarkable: His courage, both military and political, without b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">mi&s;h: And he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many qualities, which fitted him for his high &s;lation, and which rendered his u&s;urpation of it, tho' pernicious in after times, rather &s;alutary, during his own reign, to the Engli&s;h nation.</P>
<P>HENRY was twice married: By his fir&s;t wife, Mary de Bohun, daughter and heir of the earl of Hereford, he had four &s;ons, Henry, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the throne, Thomas duke of Clarence, John duke of Bedford, and Humphrey duke of Glo|ce&s;ter; and two daughters, Blanche and Philippa, the former married to the duke of Bavaria, the latter to the King of Denmark.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><MILESTONE N="1413" UNIT="year"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's former di&s;or|ders.</NOTE> THE many jealou&s;ies, to which Henry IV's &s;ituation naturally expo&s;ed him, had &s;o infected his temper, that he had been per&s;uaded to entertain unrea|&s;onable &s;u&s;picions with regard to the fidelity of his elde&s;t &s;on; and during the latter years of his life, he had excluded that prince from all &s;hare in public bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and was even di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;ee him at the head of armies, where his martial talents, tho' u&s;eful to the &s;upport of government, acquired him a renown, which, he thought, might prove dangerous to his own authority. The active &s;pirit of young Henry, re&s;trained from its proper exerci&s;e, broke out in extravagancies of every kind; and the riot of plea&s;ure, the frolics of debauchery, the outrage of wine, filled the vacancies of a mind, better adapted to the pur&s;uits of ambition, and the cares of government. This cour&s;e of life threw him among companions, who&s;e di&s;orders, if accompanied with &s;pirit and humour, he &s;econded and in|dulged; and he was detected in many &s;allies, which, to &s;everer eyes, appeared totally unworthy of his rank and &s;tation. There even remains a tradition, that, when heated with liquor and jollity, he &s;crupled not to accompany them in at|tacking the pa&s;&s;engers on the &s;treets and highways, and de&s;poiling them of their goods; and he found an amu&s;ement in the incidents, which the terror and regret of the&s;e defencele&s;s people produced on &s;uch occa&s;ions. This extreme of di&s;&s;o|lutene&s;s proved equally di&s; greeable to his father, as that eager application to bu|&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s, which had at fir&s;t given him occa&s;ion of jealou&s;y; and he &s;aw in his &s;on's behaviour the &s;ame nr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">lect of decency, the &s;ame attachm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nt to low company, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">royed the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">er&s;onal character of Richard, and which, more than all his errors in government, had tended to overturn his throne.

general con&s;idered the young prince with more indulgence; and ob&s;erv d &s;o many gleams of genero&s;ity, &s;pirit, and magnanimity, breaking continually thro' the cloud, which a wild conduct threw over his character, that they never cea&s;ed hoping for his amendment, and a&s;cribed all the weeds, which &s;hot up in that rich &s;oil, to the want of proper culture and attention in the King and his mini&s;ters. There pa&s;&s;ed an event which encouraged the&s;e agreeable views, and gave much occa&s;ion for favourable reflexions to all men of &s;en&s;e and candor. A riotous companion of the prince's had been indicted before Ga&s;coigne, the chief ju&s;tice, for &s;ome di&s;orders; and Henry was not a&s;hamed to appear at the bar with the criminal, in order to give him countenance and protection. Finding, that his pre|&s;ence had not over-awed the chief ju&s;tice, he proceeded to in&s;ult that magi|&s;trate on his tribunal; but Ga&s;coigne, mindful of the character which he then bore, and the maje&s;ty of the &s;overeign and of the laws, which he &s;u&s;tained, or|dered the prince to be carried to pri&s;on for his rude behaviour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 33.</NOTE>. The &s;pectators were agreeably di&s;appointed, when they &s;aw the heir of the crown &s;ubmit peace|ably to this &s;entence, make reparation for his error by acknowledging it, and check his impetuous nature in the mid&s;t of its extravagant career.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His reforma|tion.</NOTE> THE memory of this incident, and of many others of a like nature, rendered the pro&s;pect of the future reign no w &s;e di&s;agreeable to the nation, and encrea&s;ed the joy, which the death of &s;o unpopular a prince as his father, naturally occa|&s;ioned.

He called together his former companions, ac|quainted them with his intended information, exhorted them to imitate his ex|ample, but &s;trictly inhibited them till they had given proofs of their &s;incerity in this particular, to appear any more in his pre&s;ence; and he thus di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with liberal pre&s;ents<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 33.

The wi&s;e mini&s;ters of his father, who had checked his riots, found that they had unknowingly been paying the highe&s;t court to him; and were received with all the marks of favour and confidence. The chief ju&s;|tice him&s;elf, who trembled to approach the royal pre&s;ence, met with prai&s;es, in|&s;tead of reproaches, for his pa&s;t conduct, and was exhorted to per&s;evere in the &s;ame rigorous and imp rtial execution of the laws.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lollards.</NOTE> THERE remained among the people only one party di&s;tinction, which was de|rived from religious differences, and which, as it is of a peculiar and commonly a very ob&s;tinate nature, the popularity of Henry was not able to overcome. The Lollards were every day encrea&s;ing in the kingdom, and were become a formed party, which appeared extremely dangerous to the church, and even formidable to the civil authority<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p. 382.</NOTE>. The enthu&s;ia&s;m by which the&s;e &s;ectaries were generally actuated, the great alterations which they pretended to introduce, the hatred which they expre&s;&s;ed again&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;hed hierarchy, gave an alarm to Henry, who, either from a &s;incere attachment to the antient religion, or from the dread of the unknown con&s;equences, which attend all important changes, was determined to execute the laws again&s;t &s;uch bold innovators. The head of this &s;ect was Sir John Oldca&s;tle, lord Cobham, a nobleman, who had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his valour and his military talents, and had, on many occa&s;ions, acquired the e&s;teem both of the late and of the pre&s;ent King<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p. 382.</NOTE>.

He applied to Henry for a permi&s;&s;ion to indict lord Cob|ham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fox's Acts and Monuments, p. 513.</NOTE>; <PB N="301" REF="309">
but the generous nature of that prince was aver&s;e to &s;uch &s;anguinary me|thods of conver&s;ion. He repre&s;ented to the primate, that rea&s;on and conviction were the be&s;t expedients for &s;upporting truth; that every gentle means ought fir&s;t to be tried, in order to reclaim men from error; and that he him&s;elf would endeavour, by a conver&s;ation with Cobham, to reconcile him to the Catholic faith. But he found that nobleman ob&s;tinate in his opinions, and determined not to &s;acrifice truths of &s;uch infinite moment to his complai&s;ance for &s;overeigns<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 9. p. 61. Wal&s;ingham, p. 385.</NOTE>. Henry's principles of toleration, or rather his love of the practice, could carry him no farther; and he then gave full reins to eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;everity again&s;t this inflexible here&s;iarch. The primate indicted Cobham; and with the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of his three &s;uffragans, the bi&s;hops of London, Winche&s;ter, and St. Da|vid's, condemned him to the flames for his erroneous opinions. Cobham, who was confined to the Tower, made his e&s;cape before the day of his execution. The bold &s;pirit of this man, provoked by per&s;ecution and &s;timulated by zeal, was urged to attempt the mo&s;t criminal enterprizes; and his unlimited authority over the &s;ect proved, that he well merited the attention of the civil magi&s;trate. He formed in his retreat very violent de&s;igns again&s;t his enemies; and di&s;patching his emi&s;&s;aries to all quarters, appointed a general rendezvous of the party, in order to &s;eize the per&s;on of the King at Eltham, and put their per&s;ecutors to the &s;word<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p. 385.</NOTE>.

THESE two points were the great objects of the Lollards; but the generality of the nation was not affected in the &s;ame degree by both of them. Common &s;en&s;e and ob|viousreflection had di&s;covered to the people the advantages of a reformation in di&s;ci|pline; but the age was not yet &s;o far advanted as to be &s;eized with the &s;pirit of controver&s;y, or to enter into tho&s;e ab&s;tru&s;e do &s;trines, which the Lollards endea|voured to propagate throughout the kingdom. The very notion of here&s;y alarm|ed the genera ity of the people: Innovation in fundamental principles was &s;u&s;pi|cious: Curio&s;ity was not as yet, a proper counter-ballance to authority: And even many, who were the greate&s;t friends to the reformation of abu&s;es, were anxi|ous to ex re&s;s their dete&s;tation of the &s;peculative tenets of the Wicliffites, which, they feared, threw di&s;grace on &s;o good a cau&s;e. This turn of thought appears evidently in the proceedings of the parliament, which was &s;ummoned immedi|ately after the detection of Cobham's con&s;piracy. That a&s;&s;embly pa&s;&s;ed &s;evere laws again&s;t the new heretics: They enacted, that whoever was convicted of Lol|lardy bef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">re the Ordinary, be&s;ides &s;uffering capital pnni&s;hment according to the laws formerly e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;hould al&s;o forfeit his lands and goods to the King; and that the chancellor, trea&s;urer, ju&s;tices of the two benches, &s;heriffs, ju&s;tices of peace, and all the chief magi&s;trates in every city and borough &s;hould take an oath to u&s;e their utmo&s;t endeav urs for the extirpation of here&s;y<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Hen.

Yet this ve|ry parliament, when the King demanded &s;upply, renewed the offer formerly pre&s;&s;ed upon h s father, and entreated him to &s;eize all the eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues, and convert them to the u&s;e of the crown<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hall. fol 35.</NOTE>. The clergy were alarmed: They could offer the King no bribe which was equivalent: They only agreed to con|fer on him all the priories alien, which depended on capital abbies in Normandy, and had been bequeathed them when that province remained united to England: And Chicheley, now archbi&s;h p of Canterbury, endeavoured to divert the blow, by giving occupation to the King, and by per&s;uading him to undertake a war again&s;t France, in order to recover his lo&s;t rights to that kingdom<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 35. 36.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT was the dying injunction of the late King to his &s;on, not to allow the En|gli&s;h to remain long in peace, which was apt to breed inte&s;tine commotions; but to employ them in foreign expeditions, by which the prince might acquire ho|nour; the nobil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ty, in &s;haring his dangers, might attach them&s;elves to his per&s;on; and all the re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirits find occupation for their inquietude.

<MILESTONE N="1415" UNIT="year"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">State of France.</NOTE> THE death of Charles V. which followed &s;o &s;oon after that of Edward III. and the youth of his &s;on, Charles VI. put the two kingdoms for &s;ome time in a &s;imilar &s;ituation; and it was not to be apprehended, that either of them, during a minority, would be able to make much advantage of the weakne&s;s of the other. The jealou&s;ies al&s;o between Charles's three uncles, the dukes of Anjou, Berri, and Burgundy, had di&s;tracted the affairs of France rather more than tho&s;e between the dukes of Lanca&s;ter, York, and Gloce&s;ter, Richard's three uncles, di&s;order|ed tho&s;e of England; and had carried off the attention of the French nation from any vigorous enterprize again&s;t foreigners. But in proportion as Charles ad|vanced in years, the factions were compo&s;ed; his two uncles, the dukes of An|jou and Burgundy, died; and the King him&s;elf, a&s;&s;uming the government, gave &s;ymptoms of genius and &s;pirit, which revived the drooping hopes of his coun|try. This promi&s;ing &s;tate of affairs was not of long continuance: The unhappy prince fell &s;uddenly into a fit of frenzy, which rendered him incapable of exer|ci&s;ing his authority; and tho' he recovered from this di&s;order, he was &s;o &s;ubject to relap&s;es, that his judgment was gradually, but &s;en&s;ibly impaired, and no &s;teddy plan of government could be pur&s;ued by him. The admini&s;tration of affairs was di&s;puted between his brother, Lewis, duke of Orleans, and his cou&s;in german, John duke of Burgundy: The propinquity to the crown pleaded in favour of the former: The latter, who, in right of his mother, had inherited the county of Flan|ders, which he annexed to his father's exten&s;ive dominions, derived a lu&s;tre from his &s;uperior power: The people were divided between the&s;e contending princes: And the King, now re&s;uming and now dropping his authority, kept the victory undecided, and prevented any regular &s;ettlement of the &s;tate, by the final preva|lence of either party.</P>
<P>AT length, the dukes of Orleans and Burgundy, &s;eeming to be moved by the cries of the nation and by the interpo&s;ition of common friends, agreed to bury all pa&s;t quarrels in oblivion, and to enter into &s;trict amity together: They &s;wore before the altar to the &s;incerity of this friend&s;hip; the prie&s;t admini&s;tered the &s;a|crament to both of them; they gave to each other every pledge, which could be deemed &s;acred among men: But all this &s;olemn preparation was only a cover for the ba&s;e&s;t treachery, which was deliberately meditated by the duke of Bur|gundy. He made his rival be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated in the &s;treets of Paris: He endeavour|ed for &s;ome time to conceal the part which he took in the crime: But being detected, he embraced a re&s;olution &s;till more criminal and more dangerous to &s;o|ciety, by openly avowing and ju&s;tifying it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">La Laboureur, liv. 27. chap. 23, 24.</NOTE>.

But the mi&s;chievous effects of that tenet, had they been before any wi&s;e doubtful, appeared &s;ufficiently from the pre&s;ent incidents. The commi&s;&s;ion of this crime, which de&s;troyed all tru&s;t and &s;ecurity, rendered the war implacable between the French parties, and cut off every means of peace and accommodation. The princes of the blood, con|&s;piring with the young duke of Orleans and his brothers, made violent war on the duke of Burgundy; and the unhappy King, &s;eized &s;ometimes by one party, &s;ometimes by another, transferred alternately to each of them the appearance of legal authority. The provinces were laid wa&s;te by mutual depredations: A&s;|&s;a&s;&s;inations were every where committed from the animo&s;ity of the &s;everal leaders; or what was equally terrible, executions were ordered without any legal or free trial, by pretended courts of judicature. The whole kingdom was di&s;tingui&s;hed into two parties, the Burgundians, and the Armagnacs; &s;o the adherents of the young duke of Orleans were called, from the count of Armagnac, father-in law to that prince. The city of Paris, di&s;tracted between them, but inclining more to the Burgundians, was a perpetual &s;cene of blood and violence; the King and royal family were often detained captives in the hands of the populace; their faithful mini&s;ters were butchered or impri&s;oned before their face; and it was dan|gerous for any man, amid&s;t the&s;e enraged factions, to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by a &s;trict adherence to the principles of probity and honour.</P>

<P>THE advantage, which might be made of the&s;e confu&s;ions, was ea&s;ily per|ceived in England; and according to the maxims, which u&s;ually prevail among nations, it was determined to lay hold of the favourable opportunity. The late King, who was courted by both the French parties, fomented the quarrel, by alternately &s;ending a&s;&s;i&s;tance to both; but the pre&s;ent &s;overeign, impelled by the vigor of youth and the ardor of ambition, determined to pu&s;h his advantages to a greater length, and to carry a violent war into that di&s;tracted kingdom. But while he was making preparations for that purpo&s;e, he tried to effectuate his purpo&s;e by negotiation; and he &s;ent over amba&s;&s;adors to Paris, offering a per|petual peace and alliance; but demanding Catharine, the French King's daughter, in marriage, two millions of crowns as her portion, the payment of one million &s;ix hundred thou&s;and as the arrears of King John's ran&s;om, and the immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and full &s;overeignty of Normandy and of all the other provinces, which had been ravi&s;hed from England by the arms of Philip Augu&s;tus; together with the &s;uperiority of Brittany and Flanders<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 9. p. 208.</NOTE>.

They were willing to give him the prince&s;s in marriage, to pay him eight hundred thou&s;and crowns, to re&s;ign the entire &s;ove|reignty of Guienne, and to annex to that province the country of Perigord, Rovergue, Xaintonge, the Angoumois, and other territories<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 9. p. 211.

<P>THE three great battles of Cre&s;&s;y, Poictiers, and Azincour bore a &s;ingular re|&s;emblance to each other, in their mo&s;t con&s;iderable circum&s;tances. In all of them, there appears the &s;ame temerity in the Engli&s;h princes, who, without any object of moment, merely for the &s;ake of plunder had ventured &s;o far into the enemies country as to leave them&s;elves no re&s;ource; and unle&s;s &s;aved by the utmo&s;t imprudence in the French commanders, were, from their very &s;ituation, expo&s;ed to inevitable de&s;truction. But allowance being made for this temerity, which, according to the irregular plans of war, followed in tho&s;e ages, &s;eems to have been, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, unavoidable; there appears, in the day of action, the &s;ame pre&s;ence of mind, dexterity, courage, firmne&s;s and precaution on the part of the Engli&s;h: The &s;ame precipitation, confu&s;ion, and vain confidence on the part of the French: And the events were &s;uch as might have been ex|pected from &s;uch oppo&s;ite conduct. The immediate con&s;equences too of the&s;e three great victories were &s;imilar: In&s;tead of pu&s;hing the French with vigour, and taking advantage of their con&s;ternation, the Engli&s;h princes, after their vic|tory, &s;eem rather to have relaxed their efforts, and to have allowed the enemy leizure to recover from his lo&s;&s;es. Henry interrupted not his march a moment after the battle of Azincour; he carried his pri&s;oners to Calais, and from thence to England; he even concluded a truce with the enemy; and it was not till after an interval of two years that any body of Engli&s;h troops appeared in France.</P>
<P>THE poverty of all the European princes, and the &s;mall re&s;ources of their kingdoms, were the cau&s;es of the&s;e continual interruptions in their ho&s;tilities; and tho' the maxims of war were in general very de&s;tructive, their military opera|tions were mere incur&s;ions, which, without any &s;ettled plan, they carried on again&s;t each other. The lu&s;tre, however, attending the victory of Azincour, procured &s;ome &s;upplies from the Engli&s;h parliament; tho' &s;till unequal to the ex|pences of a campaign. They granted Henry an entire fifteenth of moveables; and they conferred on him <HI>for life</HI> the duties of tonnage and poundage, and the &s;ub&s;idies on the exportation of wool and leather. This conce&s;&s;ion is more con&s;i|derable than that which had been granted to Richard II. by his la&s;t parliament,

<P>THIS alliance, which &s;eemed to cut off from Henry all hopes of farther &s;uc|ce&s;s, proved in the i&s;&s;ue the mo&s;t favourable event which could have happened for his preten&s;ions. Whether the Dauphin and duke of Burgundy were ever &s;in|cere in their mutual engagements is uncertain; but very fatal effects re&s;ulted from their momentary and &s;eeming union. The two princes agreed to an interview, in order to concert the means of rendering effectual their common attack of the Engli&s;h; but how both or either of them could with &s;afety venture upon this conference, it &s;eemed &s;omewhat difficult to contrive. The a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination perpe|trated by the duke of Burgundy, and &s;till more, his open avowal of the deed, and defence of the doctrine, tended to di&s;&s;olve all the bands of civil &s;ociety; and even men of honour, who dete&s;ted the example, might deem it ju&s;t, on a favourable opportunity, to retaliate upon the author. The duke, therefore, who neither dared to give, nor could pretend to require any tru&s;t, agreed to all the contrivances for mutual &s;ecurity, which were propo&s;ed by the mini&s;ters of the Dauphin. The two princes came to Montereau: The duke lodged in the ca&s;tle; the Dauphin in the town, which was divided from the ca&s;tle by the river Yonne: The bridge between them was cho&s;en for the place of interview: Two high rails were drawn acro&s;s the bridge: The gates on each &s;ide were guarded, the one by the officers of the Dauphin, the other by tho&s;e of the duke: The princes were to enter into the intermediate &s;pace by the oppo&s;ite gates, accompanied each by ten per&s;ons; and with all the&s;e marks of diffidence, to conciliate their mutual friend&s;hip. But it appeared, that no precautions are &s;ufficient, where laws have no place, and where all principles of honour are utterly abandoned. Tan|negui de Chatel, and others of the Dauphin's retainers, were zealous partizans of the hou&s;e of Orleans, and they determined to &s;eize the opportunity of revenging on the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in the murder of that prince: <NOTE PLACE="marg">A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of the duke of Burgundy</NOTE> They no &s;ooner entered the rails, than

they drew their &s;words and attacked the duke of Burgundy: His friends were a&s;t ni&s;hed, and thought not of making any defence; and all of them either &s;hared his fate, or were taken pri&s;oners by the retinue of the Dauphin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St Remi, chap. 97. Mon&s;trelet, chap. 211.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE extreme youth of this prince, made it doubtful whether he was admitted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;ecret of the con&s;piracy: But as the deed was committed under his eye, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> mo&s;t intimate friends, who &s;till retained their connexions with him, the blame of the action, which was certainly more imprudent than criminal, fell en|tirely upon him. The whole &s;tate of affairs was every where changed by that unexpected incident. The city of Paris, which was pa&s;&s;ionately devoted to the fa|mily of Burgundy, broke out into the highe&s;t fury again&s;t the Dauphin. The court of King Charles entered from intere&s;t into the &s;ame views; and as all the mini&s;ters about that monarch had owed their preferment to the late duke, and fore&s;aw their downfall if the Dauphin recovered po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his father's per&s;on, they were concerned to prevent by any means, the &s;ucce&s;s of his enterprize. The Queen, per&s;evering in her unnatural animo&s;ity again&s;t her &s;on, encrea&s;ed the general flame, and in&s;pired into the King, as far as he was &s;u&s;ceptible of any &s;entiment, the &s;ame prejudices by which &s;he her&s;elf had long been actuated. But above all, Phi|lip count de Charlois, now duke of Burgundy, thought him&s;elf bound by every tye of honour and of duty, to revenge the murder of his father, and to pro&s;ecute the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in to the utmo&s;t extremity. And in this general tran&s;port of rage, every con&s;ideration of national and family intere&s;t was buried in oblivion by all parties: The &s;ubjection to a foreign enemy, the expul&s;ion of the lawful heir, the &s;lavery of the kingdom, appeared but &s;mall evils, if they led to the grati|fication of the pre&s;ent pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE King of England had, before the death of the duke of Burgundy, pro|fited extremely by the di&s;tractions of France, and was daily making a con&s;ider|able progre&s;s in Normandy. He had taken Ro&uuml;en after an ob&s;tinate &s;iege<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">T. Livii, p. 69. Mon&s;trelet, chap. 201.</NOTE>: He had made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Pontoi&s;e and Gi&s;ors: He even threatened Paris, and by the terror of his power, had obliged the court to remove to Troye: And in the mid&s;t of his &s;ucce&s;&s;es, he was agreeably &s;urprized, to find his enemies, in|&s;tead of c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">mbining again&s;t him for their mutual defence, di&s;po&s;ed to ru&s;h into his arms, and to make him the in&s;trument of their vengeance upon each other. A league was immediately concluded at Arras between him and the duke of Bur|gundy. That prince, without &s;tipulating any thing for him&s;elf, except the pro|&s;ecution of his father's murder, and the marriage of the duke of Bedford with his &s;i&s;ter was willing to &s;acrifice the kingdom to Henry's ambition, and he agreed to every demand, which was made by that monarch. In order to fini&s;h
<PB N="315" REF="323">
that a&s;toni&s;hing treaty, which was to transfer the crown of France to a &s;tranger, Henry went to Troye, accompanied by his brother, the dukes of Clarence and Gloce&s;ter; <MILESTONE N="1420" UNIT="year"> and was there met by the duke of Burgundy.

<P>SUCH was the tenor of this famous treaty; a treaty, which as nothing but the mo&s;t violent animo&s;ity could dictate, &s;o nothing but the power of the &s;word could carry it into execution. It is hard to &s;ay, whether its con&s;equences, had it taken place, would have proved more pernicious to England or to France. It mu&s;t have reduced the former kingdom to the rank of a province: It would have en|tirely disjointed the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the latter monarchy, and have brought on the de&s;truction of every de&s;cendant of the royal family: As the hou&s;es of Orleans, Anjou, Alencon, Brittany, Bourbon, and of Burgundy it&s;elf, who&s;e titles were preferable to that of the Engli&s;h princes, would on that account have been ex|po&s;ed to perpetual jealou&s;y and per&s;ecution from the &s;overeign. There was even a palpable deficiency in Henry's claim, which no art could palliate. For be&s;ides the in&s;uperable objections, to which Edward IIId's preten&s;ions were expo&s;ed, <HI>he</HI> was not heir to that monarch: If female &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was admitted, the right had devolved to the hou&s;e of Mortimer: Allowing, that Richard II. was a tyrant, and that Henry IVth's merits, in depo&s;ing him, were &s;o great towards the Engli&s;h,
<PB N="316" REF="324">
as to ju&s;tify that nation for placing him on the throne; Richard had nowi&s;e offended France, and his rival had merited nothing of that kingdom: It could not po&s;&s;ibly be pretended, that the crown of France was become an appendage to that of England; and that a prince, who, by any means, got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the latter, was, without farther que&s;tion, entitled to the former. So that on the whole, it mu&s;t be allowed, that Henry's claim to France was, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till more unintelligible, than the title, by which his father had mounted the throne of England.</P>
<P>BUT tho' all the&s;e con&s;iderations were overlooked, amid&s;t the hurry of pa&s;&s;ions, by which the courts of France and Burgundy were actuated, they would nece&s;|&s;arily revive during times of more leizure and tranquillity; and it behoved Hen|ry to pu&s;h his pre&s;ent advantages, and allow men no leizure for rea&s;on or reflec|tion. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage of the King.</NOTE> In a few days after, he e&s;pou&s;ed the prince&s;s, Catherine: He carried his fa|ther in law to Paris, and put him&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that capital: He obtained from the parliament and the three e&s;tates a ratification of the treaty of Troye: He &s;upported the duke of Burgundy in procuring a &s;entence again&s;t the murder|ers of his father: And he immediately turned his arms with &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t the adherents of the Dauphin, who, &s;o &s;oon as he heard of the treaty of Troye, took on him the &s;tyle and authority of regent, and appealed to God and his &s;word for the maintenance of his title.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t place which Henry &s;ubdued, was Sens, which opened its gates after a &s;light re&s;i&s;tance. With the &s;ame facility, he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Monte|reau. The defence of Melun was more ob&s;tinate; Barba&s;an, the governor, held out for the &s;pace of four months again&s;t the be&s;iegers; and it was famine alone which obliged him to capitulate. Henry promi&s;ed to &s;pare the lives of all the garri&s;on, except &s;uch as were accomplices in the murder of the duke of Bur|gundy; and as Barba&s;an him&s;elf was &s;u&s;pected to be of the number, his puni&s;h|ment was demanded by Philip: But the King had the genero&s;ity to intercede for him, and to prevent his execution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Holing&s;hed, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1421" UNIT="year"> THE nece&s;&s;ity of providing &s;upplies both of men and money obliged Henry to go over to England; and he left the duke of Exeter, his uncle, governor of Pa|ris during his ab&s;ence. The authority, which naturally attends &s;ucce&s;s, procured him from the Engli&s;h parliament a &s;ub&s;idy of a fifteenth; but if we may judge by the &s;mallne&s;s of this &s;upply, the nation was no wi&s;e &s;anguine on their King's victo|ries; and in proportion as the pro&s;pect of their union with France came nearer, they began to open their eyes, and to &s;ee the dangerous con&s;equences with which it
<PB N="317" REF="325">
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be attended. It was fortunate for Henry, that he had other re&s;ources, be&s;ides pecuniary &s;upplies from his native &s;ubjects. The provinces, which he had already conquered, maintained his troops; and the hopes of farther advantages al|lured to his &s;tandard all men of ambitious &s;pirits in England, who de&s;ired to &s;ig|nalize them&s;elves by arms. He a&s;&s;embled a new army of twenty four thou&s;and archers, and four thou&s;and hor&s;emen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, chap. 242.</NOTE>, and marched them to Dover, the place of embarkation. Every thing had remained in tranquillity at Paris under the duke of Exeter; but there had happened in another quarter of the kingdom a mi&s;fortune, which ha&s;tened his departure.</P>
<P>THE detention of the King of Scots in England had hitherto proved very ad|vantageous to Henry; and by keeping the regent in awe, had pre&s;erved, during the whole cour&s;e of the French war, the northern frontier in tranquillity. But when intelligence arrived in Scotland, of the progre&s;s made by Henry, and the near pro&s;pect of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown of France, the nation was alarmed, and fore&s;aw their own inevitable ruin, if the &s;ubjection of their ally left them to combat alone an enemy, who was already &s;o much &s;uperior to them in power and riches. The regent entered into the &s;ame views; and tho' he declined an open war with England, he permitted a body of &s;even thou&s;and Scots, under the command of the earl of Buchan, his &s;econd &s;on, to be tran&s;ported into France for the &s;ervice of the Dauphin. To render this aid ineffectual, Henry had carri|ed over the young King of Scots, whom he obliged to &s;end orders to his coun|trymen to leave the French &s;ervice; but the Scots general replied, that he would obey no commands which came from a King in captivity, and that a prince, while in the hands of his enemy, was no wi&s;e entitled to authority. The&s;e troops therefore, continued &s;till to act under the earl of Buchan; and were employed by the Dauphin to oppo&s;e the progre&s;s of the duke of Clarence in Anjou. The two armies encountered at Baug&eacute;: The Engli&s;h were defeated: The duke him|&s;elf was &s;lain by Sir Allan Swinton, a Scots knight, who commanded a compa|ny of men at arms: And the earls of Somer&s;et<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">His name was John, and he was afterwards created duke of Somer|&s;et. He was grand&s;on of John of Gaunt duke of Lanca&s;ter.

This was the fir&s;t action, which turned the tide of &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t the Engli&s;h; and the Dauphin, that he might both attach the Scots to his &s;ervice, and reward the valour and conduct of the earl of Buchan, honoured that nobleman with the office of con&s;table.</P>
<P>BUT the arrival of the King of England, with &s;o con&s;iderable an army, was more than &s;ufficient to repair this lo&s;s. Henry was received at Paris with great expre&s;|&s;ions
<PB N="318" REF="326">
of joy; &s;o ob&s;tinate were the prejudices of the people: And he immediately conducted his army to Chartres, which had long been be&s;ieged by the Dauphin. That prince decamped on the approach of the Engli&s;h; and being re&s;olved to decline a battle, he retired with his army<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St Remi, chap. 3.</NOTE>. Henry made him&s;elf ma&s;|ter of Dreux without a blow: He laid &s;iege to Meaux at the &s;ollicitation of the Pari&s;ians, who were much incommoded by the garri&s;on of that place. This enterprize employed the Engli&s;h arms during the &s;pace of eight months: The ba&s;tard of Vaurus, the governor of Meaux, di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by an ob|&s;tinate defence; but was at la&s;t obliged to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion. The cruelty of this officer was equal to his bravery: He was accu&s;tomed to hang without di&s;tinction all the Engli&s;h and Burgundians who fell into his hands: And Henry, in revenge of his barbarity, ordered him immediately to be hanged on the &s;ame tree, which he had made the in&s;trument of his inhuman executions<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 10. p. 212.

<P>THIS &s;ucce&s;s was followed by the &s;urrender of many other places in the neigh|bourhood of Paris, which held for the Dauphin: That prince was chaced beyond the Loire, and almo&s;t totally abandoned all the northern provinces: He was even pur&s;ued into the &s;outh by the united arms of the Engli&s;h and Burgundians, and threatened with total de&s;truction: Notwith&s;tanding the bravery and fidelity of his captains, he &s;aw him&s;elf unequal to his enemies in the open field; and found it nece&s;&s;ary to temporize, and to avoid all hazardous actions with a rival, who had gained &s;o much the a&s;cendant over him. And to crown all the other pro&s;perities of Henry, his queen was delivered of a &s;on, who was called by his father's name, and who&s;e birth was celebrated by rejoicings no le&s;s pompous and no le&s;s &s;incere at Paris than at London.

<P>THE exterior figure of this great prince, as well as his deportment, was en|gaging. His &s;tature was &s;omewhat above the middle &s;ize; his countenance beautiful; his limbs genteel and &s;lender, but full of vigour; and he excel|led in all warlike and manly exerci&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">T. Livii, p. 4.</NOTE>. He left by his queen, Catherine of France, only one &s;on, not full nine months old; who&s;e misfortunes in the cour&s;e of his life, &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all the glories and &s;ucce&s;&s;es of his father.</P>
<P>IN le&s;s than two months after Henry's death, Charles VI. of France, his fa|ther in law, terminated his unhappy life. He had, for &s;everal years, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed only the appearance of royal authority: Yet was this circum&s;tance of con&s;ider|able moment to the Engli&s;h; and divided the duty and affections of the French between them and the Dauphin. This prince was proclaimed and crowned King of France at Poictiers, under the name of Charles VII. Rheims, the place where that ceremony was u&s;ually performed, was at that time in the hands of his ene|mies.</P>
<P>CATHERINE of France, Henry's Widow, married &s;oon after his death, a Welch gentleman, Sir Owen Tudor, &s;aid to be de&s;cended from the antient prin|ces of that country: She bore him two &s;ons, Edmund and Ja&s;per, of whom, the elde&s;t was created earl of Richmond; the &s;econd earl of Pembroke. The family of Tudor, fir&s;t rai&s;ed to di&s;tinction by this alliance, mounted afterwards the throne of England.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mi&s;cellaneous tran&s;actions.</NOTE> THE long &s;chi&s;m, which had divided the Latin church for near forty years, was finally terminated in this reign by the council of Con&s;tance; which depo&s;ed the Pope, John XXIII. for his crimes, and elected Martin V. in his place, who was acknowledged by almo&s;t all the kingdoms of Europe. This great and unu&s;ual act of authority in the council gave the Roman Pontiffs ever after a mortal antipathy to the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies. The &s;ame jealou&s;y, which had long prevailed in mo&s;t European countries, between the civil ari&s;tocracy and monar|chy, now al&s;o took place between the&s;e powers in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical body. But the great &s;eparation of the bi&s;hops in the &s;everal &s;tates, and the difficulty of a&s;&s;emb|ling them, gave the Pope a mighty advantage, and made it more ea&s;y for him to collect all the power of the Hierarchy in his own per&s;on. The cruelty and treachery which attended the puni&s;hments of John Hu&s;s and Jerome of Prague, the unhappy di&s;ciples of Wickliffe, who were burned alive for their errors by

this council, prove this melancholy truth, that toleration is none of the virtues of prie&s;ts in any form of eccle&s;ia&s;tical government. But as the Engli&s;h prince had little or no concern in the&s;e great tran&s;actions, we are here the more conci&s;e in relating them.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ion of array, which I we meet with, was i&s;&s;ued in this reign<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 9. p. 254, 255.</NOTE>. The military part of the feudal &s;y&s;tem, which was the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential circum&s;tance of it, was entirely di&s;&s;olved; and could no longer &s;erve for the de|fence of the kingdom. Henry, therefore, when he went to France in 1415, empowered certain commi&s;&s;ioners to take a review of all the freemen in each county able to bear arms, to divide them into companies, and to keep them in readine&s;s for re&s;i&s;ting the enemy. This was the aera, when the feudal militia gave place to one which was perhaps &s;till le&s;s orderly and regular.</P>
<P>WE have an authentic and exact account of the ordinary revenues of the crown during this reign; and they amount only to 55,714 pounds 10 &s;hillings and 10 pence a-year<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 10. p. 113.</NOTE>. This is nearly the &s;ame with the revenues of Henry III. and the Kings of England had neither become much richer nor poorer in the cour&s;e of &s;o many years. The ordinary expences of the government amounted to 52,507 pounds 16 &s;hillings and 10 pence: So that the King had of &s;urplus only 3206 pounds 14 &s;hillings for the &s;upport of his hou&s;ehold; for his wardrobe; for the expence of emba&s;&s;ies; and other articles. This &s;um was nowi&s;e &s;ufficient; he was therefore obliged to have frequent recour&s;e to parliamentary &s;upplies, and was thus, even in time of peace, not altogether independant of his people. But wars were a mon&s;trous expence, which neither the prince's ordinary revenue, nor the extraordinary &s;upplies, were able to bear; and he was always reduced to many mi&s;erable &s;hifts, in order to make any tolerable figure in them. He commonly borrowed money from all quarters; he pawned his jewels, and &s;ometimes the crown it&s;elf<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 10. p. 190.</NOTE>; he ran in arrears to his army; and he was often obliged, not|with&s;tanding all the&s;e expedients, to &s;top in the mid&s;t of his career of victory, and to grant truces to the enemy. The high pay which was given to &s;oldiers agreed very ill with this low revenue. All the extraordinary &s;upplies granted by parliament to Henry during the cour&s;e of his reign were only &s;even tenths and fifteenths, about 203,000 pounds<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Parliamentary Hi&s;tory, vol. 2. p. 168.</NOTE>. It is ea&s;y to compute how &s;oon this money mu&s;t be exhau&s;ted by armies of 24,000 archers, and 6000 hor&s;e; when each archer had a &s;ixpence a-day<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">It appears from many pa&s;&s;ages of Rymer, particularly vol. 9. p. 258, that the King paid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> marks a-year for an archer, which is a good deal above &s;ixpence a-day.

&s;plendid &s;ucce&s;&s;es proved commonly very fruitle&s;s when &s;upported by &s;o poor a re|venue; and the debts and difficulties, which he thereby incurred, made the King pay dear for his victories. The civil admini&s;tration, likewi&s;e even in time of peace, could never be very regular, where the government was &s;o ill enabled to &s;upport it&s;elf. Henry a year before his death owed debts, which had been contracted when he was prince of Wales<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 10. p. 114.</NOTE>. It was in vain that the parliament pretended to re&s;train him from arbitrary practices, when he was reduced to &s;uch nece&s;&s;ities. Tho' the right of levying purveyance, for in&s;tance, had been expre&s;sly guarded again&s;t by the great charter it&s;elf, and was frequently complained of by the commons, it was found ab&s;olutely impracticable to aboli&s;h it; and the par|liament at length, &s;ubmitting to it as a legal prerogative, contented them&s;elves with enacting laws to limit and confine it. The duke of Gloce&s;ter, in the reign of Richard II. po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a revenue of 60,000 crowns, (about 30,000 pounds a-year of our pre&s;ent money) as we learn from Froi&s;&s;art<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Liv. 4. chap. 86.</NOTE>, and was con&s;equently richer than the King him&s;elf, if all circum&s;tances be duely con&s;idered.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that the city of Calais alone was an annual expence on the crown of 19,119 pounds<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 10. p. 113.</NOTE>; that is, above a third of the common charge of the government in time of peace. This fortre&s;s was of no u&s;e to the defence of England, and only gave that kingdom an inlet to annoy France. Ireland co&s;t two thou&s;and pounds a-year, over and above its own revenue; which was cer|tainly very low. Every thing contributes to give us a very mean idea of the &s;tate of Europe in tho&s;e ages.</P>
<P>FROM the mo&s;t early times, till the reign of Edward III. the denomination of money had never been altered: A pound &s;terling was &s;till a pound troy; that is, about three pounds of our pre&s;ent money. That conqueror was fir&s;t obliged to innovate in this important article. In the twentieth year of his reign, he coined twenty-two &s;hillings out of a pound troy; in his twenty-&s;eventh year he coined twenty-five &s;hillings. But Henry V. who was al&s;o a conqueror, rai&s;ed &s;till farther the denomination, and coined thirty &s;hillings from a pound troy<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Fleetwood's Chronicon Precio&s;um, p. 52.</NOTE>: His revenue therefore would be about 110,000 pounds of our pre&s;ent money; and by the cheapne&s;s of provi&s;ions, would be equivalent to above 330,000 pounds.</P>
<P>NONE of the princes of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter ventured to impo&s;e taxes without con&s;ent of parliament: Their doubtful or bad title became &s;o far of ad|vantage to the con&s;titution. The rule was then fixed, and could not &s;afely be broke afterwards even by more ab&s;olute princes.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1422" UNIT="year"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Government during the minority.</NOTE> DURING the reigns of the Lanca&s;trian princes, the authority of parliament &s;eems to have been more confirmed, and the privileges of the people more regarded, than during any former period; and the two preceding Kings, tho' men of great &s;pirit and abilities, ab&s;tained from &s;uch exertions of prerogative, as even weak princes, who&s;e title was undi&s;puted, were tempted to think that they might venture upon with impunity. The long minority, of which there was now the pro&s;pect, encouraged &s;till farther the lords and commons to extend their authority; and without paying much regard to the verbal de&s;tination of Henry V. they a&s;&s;umed the power of giving a new arrangement to the whole admini&s;tration. They declined altogether the name of <HI>Regent</HI> with regard to England: They appointed the duke of Bedford to be <HI>protector</HI> or <HI>guardian</HI> of that kingdom, a title which they &s;uppo&s;ed to imply le&s;s authority: They inve&s;ted the duke of Gloce&s;ter with the &s;ame dignity during the ab&s;ence of his elder brother<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 10. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">.

The per&s;on and education of the infant prince was committed to Henry Beaufort, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, his great uncle, and the legitimated &s;on of John of Gaunt, duke of Lanca&s;ter; who, as his family could never have

The two princes, the dukes of Bedford and Gloce&s;ter, who might deem them&s;elves injured by this plan of government, yet, being per&s;ons of great integrity and honour, acquie&s;ced willingly in any appointment, which &s;eemed to give &s;ecurity to the public; and as the wars in France appeared to be the object of greate&s;t moment, they avoided every di&s;pute, which might throw an ob&s;tacle in the way of the&s;e conque&s;ts.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">State of France.</NOTE> WHEN the &s;tate of affairs between the Engli&s;h and French Kings was con|&s;idered with a &s;uperficial eye, every advantage &s;eemed to be on the &s;ide of the former; and the total expul&s;ion of Charles appeared to be an event, which might naturally be expected from the &s;uperior power of his rival. Tho' Henry was yet in his infancy, the admini&s;tration was devolved on the duke of Bedford, the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed prince of his age; who&s;e experience, prudence, valor, and genero&s;ity perfectly qualified him for this high office, and enabled him both to maintain union among his friends, and to gain the confidence of his enemies. The whole power of England was at his command: He was at the head of armies enured to victory: He was &s;econded by the mo&s;t renowned generals of the age, the earls of Somer&s;et, Warwic, Sali&s;bury, Suffolk, and Arundel, Sir John Talbot and Sir John Fa&s;tolfe: And be&s;ides Guienne, the antient inheritance of England, he was ma&s;ter of the capital, and of all the northern provinces, which were be&s;t enabled to furni&s;h him with &s;upplies both of men and money, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t and &s;upport his Engli&s;h forces.</P>
<P>BUT Charles, notwith&s;tanding the pre&s;ent inferiority of his power, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome advantages, derived partly from his &s;ituation, partly from his per&s;onal character, which promi&s;ed him &s;ucce&s;s, and &s;erved, fir&s;t to controul, then to overballance, the &s;uperior force and opulence of his enemies. He was the true and undoubted heir of the monarchy: Every Frenchman, who knew the intere&s;ts or de&s;ired the independance of his country, turned his eyes towards him as its &s;ole refuge: The exclu&s;ion given him, by the imbecillity of his father, and the forced or precipitate con&s;ent of the &s;tates, had plainly no validity: That &s;pirit of faction, which had blinded the people, could not long hold them in &s;o gro&s;s a delu&s;ion: Their national and inveterate hatred again&s;t the Engli&s;h, the authors of all their mi&s;eries, mu&s;t &s;oon revive, and give them an indignation at bending their necks under the yoke of that ho&s;tile people: Great nobles and princes, ac|cu&s;tomed to maintain an independance again&s;t their native &s;overeigns, would ne|ver endure a &s;ubjection to &s;trangers: And tho' mo&s;t of the princes of the blood
<PB N="325" REF="333">
were, &s;ince the Fatal battle of Azincour, detained pri&s;oners in England, the in|habitants of their deme&s;nes, their friends, their va&s;&s;als, all declared a zealous at|tachment to the King, and exerted them&s;elves in re&s;i&s;ting the violence of foreign invaders.</P>
<P>CHARLES him&s;elf, tho' only in his twentieth year, was of a character well cal|culated to become the object of the&s;e benevolent &s;entiments; and perhaps from the favour, which naturally attends youth, was the more likely, on account of his tender age, to acquire the good-will of his native &s;ubjects. He was a prince of the mo&s;t friendly and benign di&s;po&s;ition, of ea&s;y and familiar manners, and of a ju&s;t and &s;ound, tho' not a very vigorous, under&s;tanding. Sincere, generous, affable, he engaged from affection the &s;ervices of his followers, even while his low fortunes might make it their intere&s;t to de&s;ert him; and the lenity of his temper could pardon in them tho&s;e &s;allies of di&s;content, to which princes in his &s;ituation are &s;o frequently expo&s;ed. The love of plea&s;ure often &s;educed him into indolence; but amid&s;t all his irregularities the goodne&s;s of his heart &s;till &s;hone forth; and by exerting at intervals his courage and activity, he proved, that his general remi&s;&s;ne&s;s proceeded not from the want, either of a ju&s;t &s;pirit of am|bition, or of per&s;onal valor.</P>
<P>THO' the virtues of this amiable prince lay &s;ome time in ob&s;curity, the duke of Bedford knew, that his title alone made him formidable, and that every fo|reign a&s;&s;i&s;tance would be requi&s;ite, ere a regent of England could hope to com|plete the conque&s;t of France; an enterprize, which, however it might &s;eem to be much advanced, was &s;till expo&s;ed to many and great difficulties. The chief circum&s;tance, which had procured to the Engli&s;h all their pre&s;ent advantages, was the re&s;entment of the duke of Burgundy again&s;t Charles; and as that prince &s;eemed intent rather on gratifying his pa&s;&s;ion than cou&s;ulting his intere&s;ts, it was the more ea&s;y for the regent, by demon&s;trations of re&s;pect and confidence, to retain him in the alliance of England. He bent therefore all his endeavours to that purpo&s;e: He gave the duke every proof of friend&s;hip and regard: He even proffered him the regency of France, which Philip declined: And that he might corroborate national connexions by private ties, he concluded his own marriage with the prince&s;s of Burgundy, which had been &s;tipulated by the treaty of Arras.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="year"> BEING &s;en&s;ible, that next to the alliance of Burgundy, the friend&s;hip of the duke of Brittany was of the greate&s;t importance towards forwarding the Engli&s;h conque&s;ts; and that, as the provinces of France, already &s;ubdued, lay between the dominions of the&s;e two princes, he could never hope for any &s;ecurity without
<PB N="326" REF="334">
pre&s;erving his connexions with them; he was very intent on &s;trengthening him|&s;elf al&s;o from that quarter. The duke of Brittany, having received many ju&s;t rea&s;ons of di&s;plea&s;ure from the mini&s;ters of Charles, had already acceded to the treaty of Troye, and had, with other va&s;&s;als of the crown, done homage to Henry V. in quality of heir to the kingdom: But as the regent knew, that the duke was much governed by his brother, the count de Richemont, he endeavoured to fix his friend&s;hip, by paying his court and doing &s;ervices, to this haughty and am|bitious prince.</P>
<P>ARTHUR, count de Richemont, had been taken pri&s;oner at the battle of Azin|cour, had been treated with great indulgence by the late King, and had even been permitted on his parole to take a journey into Brittany, where the &s;tate of affairs required his pre&s;ence. The death of that victorious monarch happened be|fore Riehemont's return; and this prince pretended, that, as his word was given per&s;onally to Henry V. he was not bound to fulfil it towards his &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or: <NOTE PLACE="marg">April.</NOTE> A chicane, which the regent, as he could not force him to compliance, deemed it prudent to overlook. An interview was &s;ettled at Amiens between the dukes of Bedford, Burgundy, and Brittany, at which the count de Richemont was al&s;o pre&s;ent<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 84. Mon&s;trelet, vol. 1. p. 4. Stowe, p. 364.</NOTE>: The alliance was renewed between the&s;e princes: And the regent per&s;uaded Philip to give in marriage to Richemont his elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, widow of the decea&s;ed Dauphin, Lewis, the elder brother of Charles. Thus Arthur was connected both with the regent and the duke of Burgundy, and &s;eemed engaged by intere&s;t to pro&s;ecute the &s;ame object, in forwarding the progre&s;s of the Engli&s;h arms.</P>
<P>WHILE the vigilance of the duke of Bedford was employed in gaining or con|firming the&s;e allies, who&s;e neighbourhood rendered them &s;o important, he did not overlook the &s;tate of more remote countries. The duke of Albany, regent of Scotland, had died; and his power had devolved to Murdac, his &s;on, a prince of a weak under&s;tanding and of indolent di&s;po&s;itions; who, far from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the talents requi&s;ite for the government of that fierce people, was not even able to maintain authority in his own family, or re&s;train the petulance and in&s;olence of his &s;ons. The ardor of the Scots to &s;erve in France, where Charles treated them with great honour and di&s;tinction, and where the regent's brother enjoyed the dignity of con&s;table, broke out a fre&s;h under this feeble admini&s;tration: New &s;uccours daily came over, and filled the armies of the French King: The earl of Douglas c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nducted a reinforcement of 5000 men to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. And it was ju&s;tly to be dreaded, that the Scots, by commencing open ho&s;tilities in the north,

would occa&s;ion a diver&s;ion &s;till more con&s;iderable of the Engli&s;h power, and would ea&s;e Charles, in part, of that load, by which he was at pre&s;ent &s;o griev|ou&s;ly oppre&s;&s;ed. The duke of Bedford, therefore, per&s;uaded the Engli&s;h coun|cil to form an alliance with James their pri&s;oner; to free that prince from his long captivity; and to connect him with England, by marrying him to a daughter of the earl of Somer&s;et and cou&s;in of the young King<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 86. Stowe, p. 364. Grafton, p. 501.</NOTE>. As the Scots regent, tired of his pre&s;ent dignity, which he was not able to &s;upport, was now become en|tirely &s;incere in his applications for James's liberty, the treaty was &s;oon con|cluded; forty thou&s;and pounds of ran&s;om were &s;tipulated<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 10. p. 299, 300, 326.</NOTE>; and the King of Scots was re&s;tored to the throne of his ance&s;tors, and proved, in his &s;hort reign, one of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious princes, who had ever governed that kingdom. He was murdered in 1437 by his traiterous kin&s;man the earl of Athole. His affections inclined him to the party of France; but the Engli&s;h had never rea&s;on, during his life-time, to complain of any breach of the neutrality by Scotland.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Military ope|rations.</NOTE> BUT the regent was not &s;o employed in the&s;e political negotiations as to miltary operations neglect the operations of war, from which alone he could hope to &s;ucceed in expelling the French monarch. Tho' the chief &s;eat of Charles's power lay in the &s;outhern provinces, on the other &s;ide of the Loire; his partizans were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome fortre&s;&s;es in the northern, and even in the neighbourhood of Paris; and it behoved the duke of Bedford fir&s;t to clear the&s;e countries of the enemy, before he could think of attempting more di&s;tant conque&s;ts. The ca&s;tle of Dor&s;oy was taken after a &s;iege of &s;ix weeks: That of Noyelle and the town of R&uuml;e in Pic|cardy underwent the &s;ame fate: Pont &s;ur Seine, Vertus, Montaigu were &s;ubjected by the Engli&s;h arms: And a more con&s;iderable advantage was &s;oon after gained by the united forces of England and Burgundy. John Stuart, con&s;table of Scot|land, and the lord d'E&s;ti&s;&s;ac had formed the &s;iege of Crevant in Burgundy: The earls of Sali&s;bury and Suffolk, with the count de Toulongeon, were &s;ent to its relief: A fierce and well di&s;puted action en&s;ued: The Scots and French were defeated: The con&s;table of Scotland and the count de Ventadour were taken pri&s;oners: And above a thou&s;and men, among whom was Sir William Hamilton, were left on the field of battle<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 85.

The taking of Gaillon upon the Seine, and of la Charit&eacute; upon the Loire was the fruit of this victory: And as this latter place opened an entrance into the &s;outhern provinces, the acqui&s;ition of it appeared on that account of the greater importance to the duke of Bedford, and &s;eemed to promi&s;e a &s;ucce&s;sful i&s;&s;ue to the war.</P>

<MILESTONE UNIT="year"> THE more King Charles was threatened with an inva&s;ion in tho&s;e provinces which adhered to him, the more nece&s;&s;ary it became, that he &s;hould retain po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of every fortre&s;s, which he &s;till held within the quarters of the enemy.

<P>THE condition of the King of France appeared now very terrible, and almo&s;t de&s;perate. He had lo&s;t the flower of his army and the brave&s;t of his nobles in this fatal action: He had no re&s;ources for recruiting or &s;ub&s;i&s;ting his troops: He wanted money even for his per&s;onal &s;ub&s;i&s;tance; and tho' all parade of a court was bani&s;hed, it was with difficulty he could keep a table, &s;upplied with the plaine&s;t nece&s;&s;aries, for him&s;elf and his few followers: Every day brought him intelligence of &s;ome lo&s;s or misfortune: Towns, which were bravely defended, were obliged at la&s;t to &s;urrender for want of relief or &s;upply: He &s;aw his parti|zans entirely chaced from all the provinces which lay north of the Loire: And he expected &s;oon to lo&s;e, by the united efforts of his enemies, all the territories, of which he had hitherto continued ma&s;ter; when an accident happened, which &s;aved him on the brink of ruin, and lo&s;t the Engli&s;h &s;uch an opportunity for com|pleating their conque&s;ts, as they never afterwards were able to recall.</P>
<P>JAQUELINE, counte&s;s of Hainault and Holland, and heir of the&s;e provinces, had e&s;pou&s;ed John duke of Brabant, cou&s;in german to the duke of Burgundy; but having unhappily made this choice, from the u&s;ual motives of princes, &s;he &s;oon found rea&s;on to repent her of the unequal alliance. She was a prince&s;s of a ma&s;|culine &s;pirit and uncommon under&s;tanding; the duke of Brabant was of a &s;ickly com|plexion and weak mind: She was in the vigour of her age; he had only reached his fifteenth year: The&s;e cau&s;es had in&s;pired her with &s;uch contempt of her hu&s;|band, which &s;oon proceeded to antipathy, that &s;he determined to break a mar|riage, where, it is probable, nothing but the ceremony had as yet intervened.
<PB N="330" REF="338">
The court of Rome was commonly very open to applications of this nature, when &s;econded by power and money; but as the prince&s;s fore&s;aw great oppo&s;ition from her hu&s;band's relations, and was impatient to effect her purpo&s;e, &s;he made her e&s;cape into England, and threw her&s;elf under the protection of the duke of Glo|ce&s;ter. That prince, with many noble qualities, had the defect of being govern|ed by an impetuous temper and vehement pa&s;&s;ions; and he was ra&s;hly induced, as well by the charms of the counte&s;s her&s;elf, as by the pro&s;pect of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing her r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ch inheritance, to offer him&s;elf to her as a hu&s;band. Without waiting for a papal di&s;pen&s;ation; without endeavouring to reconcile the duke of Burgundy to this mea&s;ure; he entered into a contract of marriage with Jaqueline, and imme|diately attempted to put him&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her dominions. Philip was di&s;|gu&s;ted with &s;o precipitant a conduct: He re&s;ented the injury done to the duke of Brabant his near relation: He dreaded to have the Engli&s;h e&s;tabli&s;hed on all &s;ides of him: And he fore&s;aw the con&s;equences, which mu&s;t attend the exten&s;ive and uncontrouled dominion of that nation, if, before the full &s;ettlement of their power, they in&s;ulted and injured an ally, to whom they had already been &s;o much in|debted, and who was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for &s;upporting them in their farther progre&s;s. He encouraged, therefore, the duke of Brabant to make re&s;i&s;tance: He engaged many of Jaqueline's &s;ubjects to adhere to that prince: He him&s;elf marched troops to his &s;upport: And as the duke of Gloce&s;ter &s;till per&s;evered in his purpo&s;e, a &s;harp war was &s;uddenly kindled in the Low-Countries. The quarrel &s;oon be|came per&s;onal as well as political. The Engli&s;h prince wrote to the duke of Burgundy, complaining of the oppo&s;ition made to his preten&s;ions; and tho' in the main, he employed amicable terms in his letter, he took notice of &s;ome fal&s;e|hoods, into which Philip had been betrayed during the cour&s;e of the&s;e tran&s;ac|tions. This unguarded expre&s;&s;ion was highly re&s;ented: The duke of Burgundy in&s;i&s;ted, that he &s;hould retract it: And mutual challenges and defiances pa&s;&s;ed between them on this occa&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, vol. 2. p. 19, 20, 21.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE duke of Bedford could ea&s;ily for&s;ee the bad effects of &s;o ill-timed and im|prudent a quarrel. All the &s;uccurs, which he expected from England, and which were &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in this critical emergence, were intercepted by his bro|ther, and employed in Holland and Hainault: The forces of the duke of Bur|gundy, which he al&s;o depended on, were diverted by the &s;ame wars: And be&s;ides this double le&s;s, he was in imminent danger of alienating for ever that confede|rate, who&s;e friend&s;hip was of the utmo&s;t importance to his intere&s;ts, and whom the late King had injoined him, with his dying breath, to gratify by every mark of regard and attachment.

to mitigate the re&s;entment of the duke of Burgundy: He interpo&s;ed with his good offices between the&s;e princes: But he was not &s;ucce&s;sful in any of his endeavours; and he found, that the impetuo&s;ity of his brother's temper was &s;till the chief ob&s;tacle to all accommodation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, p. 18.</NOTE>. For this rea&s;on, in&s;tead of pu&s;h|ing the victory gained at Verne&uuml;il, he found him&s;elf obliged to take a journey into England, and to try, by his councils and authority, to moderate the mea|&s;ures of the duke of Gloce&s;ter.</P>

Time al&s;o &s;eemed to open expedi|ents for compo&s;ing the difference with the duke of Burgundy.

But tho' the affair was thus terminated to the advantage of Philip, it left a di&s;agreeable impre&s;&s;ion on his mind: It excited an extreme jealou&s;y of the En|gli&s;h, and opened his eyes to his true intere&s;ts: And as nothing but his animo&s;i|ty again&s;t Charles had engaged him in alliance with them, it counterballanced that pa&s;&s;ion by another of the &s;ame kind, which in the end became prevalent, and brought him back, by degrees, to his natural connexions with his family and his native country.</P>
<P>ABOUT the &s;ame time, the duke of Brittany began to withdraw him&s;elf from the Engli&s;h alliance. His brother, the count de Richemont, tho' connected by
<PB N="332" REF="340">
marriage with the dukes of Burgundy and Bedford, was extremely attached by inclination to the French intere&s;t; and he willingly hearkened to all the advances which Charles made him for obtaining his friend&s;hip. The high office of con|&s;table, vacant by the earl of Buchan's death, was offered him; and as his mar|tial and ambitious temper a&s;pired to the command of armies, which he had in vain attempted to obtain from the duke of Bedford, he not only accepted that tru&s;t, but brought over his brother to an alliance with the French monarch. The new con&s;tab e, having made this one change in his mea&s;ures, firmly adhered ever after to his engagements with France. Tho' his pride and violence, which would admit of no rival in his ma&s;ter's confidence, and even prompted him to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the other favourites, had &s;o much di&s;gu&s;ted Charles, that he once bani&s;hed him the court, and refu&s;ed to admit him to his pre&s;ence, he &s;till acted with vigour for the &s;ervice of that monarch, and obtained at la&s;t, by his per&s;everance, the pardon of all his pa&s;t offences.</P>

The duke of Burgundy was much di&s;|gu&s;ted. The duke of Brittany had entered into engagements with Charles, and had done homage to that prince for his dutchy. The French had been allowed to recover from the a&s;toni&s;hment, into which their frequent di&s;a&s;ters had thrown them. An incident even happened, which &s;erved extremely to rai&s;e their cou|rage. The earl of Warwic had be&s;ieged Montargis with a &s;mall army of 3000 men; and the place was reduced to extremity, when the ba&s;tard of Orleans un|dertook to throw relief into it. This general, who was natural &s;on to the prince a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by the duke of Burgundy, and who was afterwards created count de Dunois, conducted a body of 1600 men to Montargis; and made an attack on the enemy's trenches with &s;o much valour, prudence, and good fortune, that he not only penetrated into the place, but gave a &s;evere blow to the Engli&s;h, and obliged Warwic to rai&s;e the &s;iege<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, vol. 2. p. 32, 33.

<P>BUT the regent, &s;oon after his arrival, revived the credit of the Engli&s;h arms, by an important enterprize, which he happily atchieved.

The lord of Gaucour, a brave and experienced captain, was appointed governor: Many officers of di&s;tinction threw them&s;elves into the place: The troops, which they conducted, were enured to war, and were determined to make the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance: And even the inhabitants, di&s;ciplined by the long continuance of ho&s;tilities, were well qua|lified, in their own defence, to &s;econd the efforts of the mo&s;t veteran &s;orces.

It is ea&s;y to imagine, that the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of France was an intere&s;ting object even to per&s;ons of the lowe&s;t rank, and would become the frequent &s;ubject of their conver&s;ation: A young prince, expelled his native throne, by the &s;edition of &s;ubjects and by the arms of &s;trangers, could not fail to move the compa&s;&s;ion of all his people, who&s;e hearts were uncorrupted by faction; and the peculiar cha|racter of Charles, &s;o &s;trongly inclined to friend&s;hip and the tender pa&s;&s;ions, na|turally rendered him the hero of that &s;ex, who&s;e generous minds know no bounds in their affections. The &s;iege of Orleans, the progre&s;s of the Engli&s;h before that place, the great di&s;tre&s;s of the garri&s;on and inhabitants, the importance of &s;aving the city and ts brave defenders, had turned thither the eyes of all the world; and Joan, inflamed by the general &s;entiment, was &s;eized with a wild de&s;ire of bringing relief to her &s;overeign in his pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;es. Her unexperienced mind, working day and night on this favourite object, mi&s;took the impul&s;es of her pa&s;&s;ion for heavenly in&s;pirations; and &s;he fancied, that &s;he &s;aw vi&s;ions and heard voices, exhorting her to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the throne of France, and to expel the foreign invaders. An uncommon intrepidity of temper made her overlook all the dangers, which might attend her in &s;uch a path; and thinking her&s;elf de&s;|tined by heaven to this office, &s;he threw a&s;ide that ba&s;hfulne&s;s and timidity, which would naturally adhore to her &s;ex, her years, and her low &s;tation. She went to Baudricourt, governor of Vaucouleurs; procured adm &s;&s;ion to him; informed him of her in&s;pirations and intentions; and conjured him not to neglect the voice of God, who &s;poke thro' her, but to &s;econd tho&s;e heavenly revelations, which impelled her to this glorious enterprize. Baudricourt treated her at fir&s;t with &s;ome neglect; but on her frequent returns to him, and importunate &s;ollicitations, he began to remark &s;omething extraordinary in the maid, and was inclined, at a l hazards, to make &s;o ea&s;y an experiment. It is uncertain, whether this gentle|man had di&s;cernment enough to perceive, that great u&s;e might be made with the vulgar of &s;o uncommon an engine; or, what is more likely in that credulous age, was him&s;elf a convert to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">is vi&s;ionary: But he adopt d at la&s;t the &s;cheme of Joan; and he gave her &s;om<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> attendants, who conducted her to the French court, which at that time re&s;ided at Chinon.</P>

with the known facts and circum&s;tances. It is pretended, that Joan, im|mediately on her admi&s;&s;ion, knew the King, tho' &s;he had never &s;een his face be|fore, and tho' he purpo&s;ely kept him&s;elf in the crowd of courtiers, and had laid a&s;ide every thing in his dre&s;s and apparel, which might di&s;tingui&s;h him: That &s;he offered him, in the name of the &s;upreme Creator, to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Orleans, and conduct him to Rheims to be there crowned and anointed; and on his expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome doubts of her mi&s;&s;ion, revealed to him, before &s;ome &s;worn confidents, a &s;ecret, which was unknown to all the world but him&s;elf, and which nothing but a heavenly in&s;piration could di&s;cover to her: And that &s;he demanded, as the in&s;trument of her future victories, a particular &s;word, which was kept in the church of St. Catharine de Fierbois, and which, tho' &s;he had never &s;een it, &s;he de&s;cribed by all its marks, and by the place in which it had long been laid and neglected<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 107. Holing&s;hed, p. 600.</NOTE>. This is certain, that all the&s;e miraculous &s;tories were &s;pread abroad, in order to catch the vulgar. The more the King and his mini&s;ters were determined to give into the illu&s;ion, the more &s;cruples they pre|tended. An a&s;&s;embly of grave doctors and theologians cautiou&s;ly examined Joan's mi&s;&s;ion, and pronounced it undoubted and &s;upernatural. She was &s;ent to the parliament, then re&s;iding at Poictiers; and was interrogated before that a&s;|&s;embly: The pre&s;idents, the coun&s;ellors, who came per&s;uaded of her impo&s;ture, went away convinced of her in&s;piration. A ray of hope began to break thro' that de&s;pair, in which the minds of all men were before enveloped. Heaven had now declared it&s;elf in favour of France, and had laid bare its out-&s;tretched arm to take vengeance on her invaders. Few could di&s;tingui&s;h between the impul&s;e of inclination and the force of conviction; and none would &s;ubmit to the trouble of &s;o di&s;agreeable a &s;crutiny.</P>
<P>AFTER the&s;e artificial precautions and preparations had been for &s;ome time employed, Joan's reque&s;ts were at la&s;t complied with: She was armed cap-apee, mounted on hor&s;eback, and &s;hown in that martial habiliment before the whole people. Her dexterity in managing her &s;teed, tho' acquired in her former occu|pation, was regarded as a new proof of her mi&s;&s;ion; and &s;he was received with the loude&s;t acclamations by the &s;pectators. Her former occupation was even denied: She was no longer the &s;ervant of an inn: She was converted into a &s;hepherde&s;s, an employment much more agreeable to the imagination. To ren|der her &s;till more intere&s;ting, near ten years were &s;ub&s;tracted from her age; and all the &s;entiments of love and of chivalry, were thus united to tho&s;e of en|thu&s;ia&s;m, in order to inflame the fond fancy of the people with prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in her favour.</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="346">
WHEN the engine was thus dre&s;&s;ed up in full &s;plendor, it was time to e&s;&s;ay its force again&s;t the enemy. Joan was &s;ent to Blois, where a large convoy was prepared for the &s;upply of Orleans, and an army of ten thou&s;and men, under the command of St. Severe, a&s;&s;embled to e&s;cort it. She ordered all the &s;oldiers to confe&s;s them&s;elves before they &s;et out on the enterprize: She bani&s;hed from the camp all women of bad fame: She di&s;played in her hands a con&s;ecrated ban|ner; where the Supreme Being was repre&s;ented, gra&s;ping the globe of earth, and &s;urrounded with Flower de Luces. And &s;he in&s;i&s;ted, in right of her prophetic mi&s;&s;ion, that the convoy &s;hould enter Orleans, by the direct road from the &s;ide of Beau&s;&s;e; but the count de Dunois, unwilling to &s;ubmit the rules of the mili|tary art to her in&s;pirations, ordered it to approach by the other &s;ide of the river, where, he knew, the weake&s;t part of the Engli&s;h army was &s;tationed.</P>
<P>PREVIOUS to this attempt, the maid had wrote to the regent and to the Eng|li&s;h generals before Orleans, commanding them, in the name of the omnipotent Creator, by whom &s;he was commi&s;&s;ioned, immediately to rai&s;e the &s;iege and to evacuate France; and menacing them with divine vengeance in ca&s;e of their di&s;|obedience. All the Engli&s;h affected to &s;peak with deri&s;ion of the Maid and of her heavenly commi&s;&s;ion; and &s;aid, that the French King was now indeed re|duced to a &s;orry pa&s;s, when he had recour&s;e to &s;uch ridiculous expedients: But they felt their imagination &s;ecretly &s;truck with the vehement per&s;ua&s;ion, which prevailed in all around them; and they waited with an anxious expectation, not unmixed with horror, for the i&s;&s;ue of the&s;e extraordinary preparations.</P>
<P>AS the convoy approached the river, a &s;ally was made by the garri&s;on on the &s;ide of Beau&s;&s;e, to prevent the Engli&s;h general from &s;ending any detachment to the other &s;ide: <NOTE PLACE="marg">29th April.</NOTE> The provi&s;ions were peaceably embarked in boats, which the inhabitants of Orleans had &s;ent to receive them: The maid covered with her troops the embarkation: Suffolk ventured not to attack her: And the French general carried back the army in &s;afety to Blois; an alteration of affairs, which was already vi&s;ible to all the world, and which had a proportional effect on the minds of both parties.</P>
<P>THE Maid entered the town of Orleans, arrayed in her military garb, and di&s;playing her con&s;ecrated &s;tandard; and was received, as a cele&s;tial deliverer, by all the inhabitants. They now believed them&s;elves invincible under her &s;acred influence; and Dunois him&s;elf, perceiving &s;uch a mighty alteration both in friends and foes, con&s;ented, that the next convoy, which was expected in a few days, &s;hould enter by the &s;ide of Beau&s;&s;e. <NOTE PLACE="marg">4th May.</NOTE> The convoy approached: No&s;ign of re&s;i&s;tance appeared in the be&s;iegers: The waggons and troops pa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="339" REF="347">
without interruption between the redoubts of the Engli&s;h: A dead &s;ilence and a&s;toni&s;hment reigned among tho&s;e troops, formerly &s;o elated with victory, and &s;o fierce for the combat.</P>
<P>THE earl of Suffolk was in a &s;ituation very unu&s;ual and extraordinary; and which might well confound the man of the greate&s;t capacity and firme&s;t temper. He &s;aw his troops overawed, and &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with the idea of a divine in|fluence, accompanying the Maid. In&s;tead of bani&s;hing the&s;e vain terrors by hurry and action and war, he waited till the &s;oldiers &s;hould recover from the pa|nic; and he thereby gave leizure for the&s;e prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to &s;ink &s;till deeper into their minds. The military maxims, which are prudent in common ca&s;es, deceived him in the&s;e unaccountable events. The Engli&s;h felt their courage daunted and overwhelmed; and thence inferred a divine vengeance hanging over them. The French drew the &s;ame inference from an inactivity &s;o new and unexpected. Every circum&s;tance was now rever&s;ed in the opinions of men, on which all de|pends: The &s;pirit, re&s;ulting from a long cour&s;e of uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;s, was on a &s;udden transferred from the victors to the vanqui&s;hed.</P>
<P>THE Maid called aloud, that the garri&s;on &s;hould remain no longer on the de|fen&s;ive; and &s;he promi&s;ed her followers the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of heaven in attacking tho&s;e redoubts of the enemy, which had &s;o long kept them in awe, and which they had never hitherto dared to in&s;ult. The generals &s;econded her ardor: An attack was made on one redoubt, and it proved &s;ucce&s;sful<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, vol. 2. p. 45.</NOTE>: All the Engli&s;h, who de|fended the entrenchments, were put to the &s;word or taken pri&s;oners: And Sir John Talbot him&s;elf, who had drawn together, from the other redoubts, &s;ome troops to bring them relief, dared not to appear in the open field again&s;t &s;o for|midable an enemy.</P>
<P>NOTHING &s;eemed impo&s;&s;ible after this &s;ucce&s;s to the Maid and her enthu&s;ia&s;tic votaries. She urged the generals to attack the main body of the Engli&s;h in their entrenchments: But Dunois, &s;till unwilling to hazard the fate of France by too great temerity, and &s;en&s;ible that the lea&s;t rever&s;e of fortune would make all the pre&s;ent vi&s;ions evaporate, and re&s;tore every thing to its former condition, checked her vehemence, and propo&s;ed to her, fir&s;t to expel the enemy from their forts on the other &s;ide of the river, and thus lay the communication with the country entirely open, before &s;he attempted any more hazardous enterprize. Joan was per&s;uaded, and the&s;e forts were vigorou&s;ly a&s;&s;ailed. In one attack the French were repul&s;ed; the Maid was left almo&s;t alone; &s;he was obliged to retreat, and join the runaways; but di&s;playing her &s;acred &s;tandard, and animating them
<PB N="340" REF="348">
with her countenance, her ge&s;tures, her exhortations, &s;he led them back to the charge, and overpowered the Engli&s;h in their entrenchments. In the attack of another fort, &s;he was wounded in the neck with an arrow; &s;he retreated a mo|ment behind the a&s;&s;ailants; &s;he pulled out the arrow with her own hands; &s;he had the wound quickly dre&s;&s;ed; and &s;he ha&s;tened back to head the troops, and to plant her victorious banner on the ramparts of the enemy.</P>
<P>BY all the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es, the Engli&s;h were entirely chaced from their forti|fications on that &s;ide: They had lo&s;t above &s;ix thou&s;and men in the&s;e different actions; and what was &s;till more important, their wonted courage and confi|dence was wholly gone, and had given place to amazement and de&s;pair. The Maid returned triumphant over the bridge, and was again received as the guar|dian angel of the city. After performing &s;uch miracles, &s;he convinced the mo&s;t obdurate incredulity of her divine mi&s;&s;ion: Men felt them&s;elves animated as by a &s;uperior energy, and thought nothing impo&s;&s;ible to that divine hand, which &s;o vi&s;ibly conducted them. It was in vain even for the Engli&s;h generals to oppo&s;e with their &s;oldiers the prevailing opinion of &s;upernatural influence: They them|&s;elves were probably moved by the &s;ame belief: The utmo&s;t they dared to ad|vance, was, that Joan was not an in&s;trument of God; &s;he was only the imple|ment of the Devil: But as the Engli&s;h had felt, to their &s;ad experience, that the Devil might be allowed &s;ometimes to prevail, they derived not much con&s;o|lation from the enforcing of this opinion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;iege of Orleans ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">d.</NOTE> IT might prove extremely dangerous for Suffolk, with &s;uch intimidated troops, to remain any longer in the pre&s;ence of &s;uch a courageous and victorious enemy; and he therefore rai&s;ed the &s;iege, and retreated with all the precautions ima|ginable. <NOTE PLACE="marg">8th May.</NOTE> The French re&s;olved to pu&s;h their conque&s;ts, and to allow the Eng|li&s;h no leizure to recover from their con&s;ternation. Charles formed a body of &s;ix thou&s;and men, and &s;ent them to attack Jergeau, whither Suffolk had retired with a detachment of his army. The &s;iege la&s;ted ten days; and the place was ob&s;tinately defended. Joan di&s;played her wonted intrepidity on this occa&s;ion. She de&s;cended into the fo&s;&s;ee, in leading the attack; and &s;he there received a blow on the head with a &s;tone, by which &s;he was confounded and beat to the ground: But &s;he &s;oon recovered her&s;elf; and in the end rendered the a&s;&s;ault &s;ucce&s;sful: Suffolk was obliged to yield him&s;elf pri&s;oner to a Frenchman called Renaud; but before the &s;ubmitted, he a&s;ked his adver&s;ary, whether he was a gen|tleman. On receiving a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer, he demanded, whether he was a knight. Renaud replied, that he had not yet attained that honour. <HI>Then I make you one,</HI> replied Suffolk: Upon which, he gave him the blow with his
<PB N="341" REF="349">
&s;word, which dubbed him into that fraternity; and he immediately &s;urrendered him&s;elf his pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>THE remainder of the Engli&s;h army was commanded by Fa&s;tolfe, Scales and Talbot, who thought of nothing but of making their retreat, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, into a place of &s;afety; while the French e&s;teemed the overtaking them equivalent to a victory. So much had the events, which pa&s;&s;ed before Orleans, altered every thing between the two nations! The vanguard of the French under Xain|trailles attacked the rear of the enemy at the village of Patay. <NOTE PLACE="marg">18th June.</NOTE> The battle la&s;ted not a moment: The Engli&s;h were di&s;comfited and fled: The brave Fa&s;tolfe him|&s;elf &s;howed the example of flight to his troops; and the order of the garter was taken from him, as a puni&s;hment for this in&s;tance of cowardice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, vol. 2. p. 46.</NOTE>. Two thou|&s;and men were killed in this action; and both Talbot and Scales taken pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>IN the account of all the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es, the French writers, to magnify the won|der, repre&s;ent the Maid (who was now known by the appellation of <HI>the maid of Orleans</HI>) as not only active in the combats, but as performing the office of gene|ral; directing the troops, conducting the military operations, and &s;waying the deliberations in all councils of war. It is certain, that the policy of the French court endeavoured to maintain this appearance with the public: But it is much more probable, that Dunois and the wi&s;er commanders prompted her in all her mea&s;ures, than that a country girl, without experience or education, could, on a &s;udden, become expert in a profe&s;&s;ion, which requires more genius and capa|city, than any other active &s;cene of life. It is &s;ufficient prai&s;e, that &s;he could di&s;tingui&s;h the per&s;ons on who&s;e judgment &s;he might rely; that &s;he could &s;eize their hints and &s;ugge&s;tions, and, on a &s;udden, deliver their opinion as her own; and that &s;he could curb, on occa&s;ion, that vi&s;ionary and enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;pirit, with which &s;he was undoubtedly actuated, and could temper it with prudence and di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>THE rai&s;ing of the &s;iege of Orleans was one part of the Maid's promi&s;e to Charles: The crowning him at Rheims was the other: And &s;he now in&s;i&s;ted vehemently, that he &s;hould forthwith &s;et out on that enterprize. A few weeks before, &s;uch a propo&s;al would have appeared the mo&s;t extravagant in the world. Rheims lay in a di&s;tant quarter of the kingdom; was then in the hands of a victorious enemy; the whole road, which led to it, was occupied by their gar|ri&s;ons; and no imagination could be &s;o &s;anguine as to think, that &s;uch an at|tempt could &s;o &s;oon come within the bounds of po&s;&s;ibility. But as it was ex|tremely
<PB N="342" REF="350">
the intere&s;t of Charles to maintain the belief of &s;omething extraordinary and divine in the&s;e events, and to avail him&s;elf of the pre&s;ent con&s;ternation of the Engli&s;h; he re&s;olved to follow the exhortations of his warlike prophete&s;s, and to lead his army upon this promi&s;ing adventure. Hitherto, he had kept remote from the &s;cene of war: As the &s;afety of the &s;tate depended entirely upon his per&s;on, he had been per&s;uaded to re&s;train his military ardour: But ob&s;erv|ing this pro&s;perous turn of affairs, he now determined to appear at the head of his armies, and to &s;et the example of valour to all his &s;oldiers. And the French nobility &s;aw at once their young &s;overeign a&s;&s;uming a new and more brilliant character, &s;econded by fortune, and conducted by the hand of heaven; and they caught fre&s;h zeal to exert them&s;elves in replacing him on the throne of his an|ce&s;tors.</P>

All the va&s;&s;als of the crown, who lived with|in the provinces po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Engli&s;h, &s;wore anew allegiance and did ho|mage to him. But this ceremony was cold and in&s;ipid in compari&s;on of the eclat which had attended the coronation of Charles at Rheims; and the duke of Bed|ford expected more effect from an accident, which put into his hands the per&s;on, who had been the author of all his calamities.</P>
<P>THE maid of Orleans, after the coronation of Charles, declared to the count de Dunois, that her wi&s;hes were now &s;atisfied, and that &s;he had no farther de|&s;ire than to return to her former condition, and to the occupations and cour&s;e of life, which became her &s;ex: But that nobleman, &s;en&s;ible of the mighty advan|tages, which might &s;till be reaped from her pre&s;ence in the army, exhorted her to per&s;evere, till, by the final expul&s;ion of the Engli&s;h, &s;he had brought all her pro|phecies to their full completion. In pur&s;uance of this advice, &s;he threw her&s;elf into the town of Compiegne, which was at that time be&s;ieged by the duke of Burgundy, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the earls of Arundel and Suffolk; and the garri&s;on on her appearance believed them&s;elves thenceforth invincible. But their joy was of &s;hort duration. <NOTE PLACE="marg">25th May</NOTE> The Maid, next day after her arrival, headed a &s;ally upon the quar|ters of John de Luxembourg; &s;he twice drove the enemy from their entrench|ments; finding their numbers to encrea&s;e every moment, &s;he ordered a retreat; when hard pre&s;&s;ed by the pur&s;uers, &s;he turned upon them, and made them again recoll; but being here de&s;erted by her friends, and &s;urrounded by the enemy, &s;he was at la&s;t, after exerting the utmo&s;t valour, taken pri&s;oner by the Burgun|dians<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 371.</NOTE>. The common opinion was, that the French officers, finding the merit of every victory a&s;cribed to her, had, in envy to her renown, by which they them&s;elves were &s;o much eclip&s;ed, willingly expo&s;ed her to this fatal accident.</P>
<P>THE envy of her friends on this occa&s;ion was not a greater proof of her merit than the triumph of her enem es. A complete victory would not have given more joy to the Engli&s;h and their partizans. The &s;ervice of <HI>te deum,</HI> which has &s;o often been prophaned by princes, was publickly celebrated on this fortunate event at Paris. The duke of Bedford fancied, that, by the captivity of that ex|traordinary

woman, who had bla&s;ted all his &s;ucce&s;&s;es, he would again recover his former a&s;cendant over France; and to pu&s;h farther the pre&s;ent advantage, he pur|cha&s;ed the captive from John de Luxembourg, and formed a pro&s;ecution again&s;t her, which, whether it proceeded from vengeance or policy, was equally barba|rious, and di&s;honourable.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1431" UNIT="year"> THERE was no po&s;&s;ible rea&s;on, why Joan &s;hould not be regarded as a pri&s;o|ner of war, and be entitled to all the courte&s;y and good u&s;age, which civilized nations practi&s;e towards enemies on the&s;e occa&s;ions. She had never, in her mili|tary capacity, forfeited, by any act of treachery or cruelty, her claim to that treatment: She was un&s;tained with any civil crime: Even the virtues and the very decorums of her &s;ex had ever been rigidly ob&s;erved by her<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We learn from her trial in Pa&s;quier, that when accu&s;ed of having put to death Franquet d'Arras her pri&s;oner, &s;he ju&s;tified her&s;elf by &s;aying, that he was a known robber, and lay under &s;entence of death by a civil magi&s;trte. She was &s;o careful of ob&s;erving decorums, that, when &s;he was in any town or garri&s;on, &s;he always went to bed with &s;ome women of character in the place: When in the camp, &s;he lay in armour, and always had one of her brothers on each &s;ide of her.

It was nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, for the duke of Bedford to intere&s;t religion &s;ome way in the pro&s;ecution; and to cover under that cloak his flagrant violation of ju&s;tice and humanity.</P>
<P>THE bi&s;hop of Beauvais, a man wholly devoted to the Engli&s;h intere&s;t, pre|&s;ented a petition again&s;t Joan, on pretence that &s;he was taken within the bounds of his dioce&s;e, and he de&s;ired to have her tried by an eccle&s;ia&s;tical court for for|cery, impiety, idolatry and magic: The univer&s;ity of Paris was &s;o mean as to join in the &s;ame reque&s;t: Several prelates, among whom the cardinal of Winche|&s;ter was the only Engli&s;hman, were appointed her judges: They held their court in Ro&uuml;en, where the young King of England then re&s;ided: And the maid, cloath|ed in her former military apparel, but loaded with irons, was produced before this tribunal.</P>
<P>SHE fir&s;t de&s;ired to be ea&s;ed of her chains: Her judges an&s;wered that &s;he had once already attempted an e&s;cape by throwing her&s;elf from a tower: She confe&s;|&s;ed the fact, maintained the ju&s;tice of her intention, and owned, that, if &s;he could, &s;he could &s;till execute that purpo&s;e.

cour&s;e of four months, &s;he never betrayed any weakne&s;s or womani&s;h &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and no advantage was gained over her. The point, which her judges pu&s;hed mo&s;t vehemently, was her vi&s;ions and revelations and intercour&s;e with departed &s;aints; and they a&s;ked her, whether &s;he would &s;ubmit to the church the truth of the&s;e in&s;pirations: She replied, that &s;he would &s;ubmit them to God, the fountain of truth. They then exclaimed, that &s;he was a heretic, and denied the authori|ty of the church. She appealed to the Pope: They rejected her appeal.</P>
<P>THEY a&s;ked her, why &s;he put tru&s;t in her &s;tandard, which had been con&s;e|crated by magical incantations: She replied, that &s;he put tru&s;t in the Supreme Being alone, who&s;e image was impre&s;&s;ed upon it. They demanded, why &s;he carried in her hand that &s;tandard at the anointment and coronation of Charles at Rheims: She an&s;wered, that the per&s;on, who had &s;hared the danger, was enti|tied to &s;hare the glory. When accu&s;ed of going to war contrary to the decorums of her &s;ex, and of a&s;&s;uming government and command over men; &s;he &s;crupled not to reply, that her &s;ole purpo&s;e was to defeat the Engli&s;h, and to expel them from the kingdom of France. In the i&s;&s;ue, &s;he was condemned for all the crimes of which &s;he had been accu&s;ed, aggravated by here&s;y; her revelations were de|clared to be inventions of the devil to delude the people; and &s;he was &s;entenced to be delivered over to the &s;ecular arm.</P>
<P>JOAN, &s;o long &s;urrounded by inveterate enemies, who treated her with every mark of contumely; brow-beaten and overawed by men of &s;uperior rank, and men inve&s;ted with the en&s;igns of a &s;acred character, which &s;he had been accu&s;|tomed to revere; felt her &s;pirit at la&s;t &s;ubdued, and tho&s;e vi&s;ionary dreams of in&s;piration, in which &s;he had been buoyed up by the triumphs of &s;ucce&s;s and the applau&s;es of her own party, gave way to the terrors of that puni&s;hment to which &s;he was &s;entenced. She publickly declared her&s;elf willing to recant; &s;he acknow|ledged the illu&s;ion of tho&s;e revelations which the church had rejected; and &s;he promi&s;ed never more to maintain them. Her &s;entence was then mitigated: She was condemned to perpetual impri&s;onment, and to be fed during life on bread and water.</P>
<P>ENOUGH was now done to fulfill all political views, and to convince both the French and the Engli&s;h, that the opinion of divine influence, which had &s;o much encouraged the one and daunted the other, was entirely without foundation. But the barbarous vengeance of Joan's enemies was not &s;atisfied with this victo|ry. Su&s;pecting, that the female dre&s;s, which &s;he had now con&s;ented to wear, was di&s;agreeable to her, they purpo&s;ely placed in her apartment a &s;uit of man's apparel; and watched for the effect of that temptation upon her. On the &s;ight of a dre&s;s, in which &s;he had acquired &s;o much renown, and which, &s;he once

believed, &s;he wore by the particular appointment of heaven, all her former ideas and pa&s;&s;ions revived; and &s;he ventured in her &s;olitude to cloath her&s;elf again in the &s;orbidden garment. Her in&s;idious enemies caught her in that &s;ituation: Her fault was interpreted to be no le&s;s than a relap&s;e into here&s;y: No recantation would now &s;uffice, and no pardon could be granted her. She was condemned to be burned in the market place of Ro&uuml;en; and the infamous &s;entence was ac|cordingly <NOTE PLACE="marg">Execution of the maid of Orleans. 14th June.</NOTE> executed. This admirable heroine, to whom the more generous &s;u|per&s;tition of the antients would have erected altars, was, on pretence of he|re&s;y and magic, delivered over alive to the flames, and expiated by that dread|ful puni&s;hment the &s;ignal &s;ervices, which &s;he had rendered to her prince and to her native country.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1432" UNIT="year"> THE affairs of the Engli&s;h, far from being advanced by this execution, went every day more and more to decay: The great abilities of the regent were un|able to re&s;i&s;t the &s;trong inclination, which had &s;eized the French to return under the obedience of their rightful &s;overeign, and which that act of cruelty was ill fitted to remove. Chartres was &s;urprized by a &s;tratagem of the count de Du|nois: A body of the Engli&s;h, under lord Willoughby, was defeated at St. Ce|lerin upon the Sarte<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, vol. 2. p. 100.</NOTE>: The fair in the &s;uburbs of Caen, &s;eated in the mid&s;t of the Engli&s;h territories, was pillaged by de Lore, a French captain of reputation: The duke of Bedford him&s;elf was obliged by Dunois to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Lagni with &s;ome di&s;honour: And all the&s;e misfortunes, tho' light, yet being continued and uninterrupted, brought di&s;credit to the Engli&s;h, and menaced them with an approaching lo&s;s of all their conque&s;ts. But the chief detriment, which the re|gent &s;u&s;tained, was by the death of his dutche&s;s, who had hitherto pre&s;erved &s;ome appearance of friend&s;hip between him and her brother, the duke of Bur|gundy<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, vol. 2. p. 87.</NOTE>: And his marriage &s;oon afterwards, with Jaqueline of Luxembourg, was the beginning of a breach between them<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 373.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Defection of the duke of Burgundy.</NOTE> NOTHING could be more repugnant to the intere&s;ts of the hou&s;e of Burgundy, than to unite the crowns of France and England on the &s;ame head; an event, which, had it taken place, would have reduced the duke to the rank of a petty prince, and have rendered his &s;ituation entirely dependant and precarious. The title al&s;o to the crown of France, which, after the failure of the elder branches, might accrue to the duke or his po&s;terity, had been &s;acrificed by the treaty of Troye; and &s;trangers and enemies were thereby irrevocably fixed upon the throne. Revenge alone had carried Philip into the&s;e impolitic mea&s;ures; and a point of honour had hitherto induced him to maintain them. But as it is the nature of pa&s;&s;ion gradually to decay; while the &s;en&s;e of intere&s;t maintains an eternal influence and authority; the duke had, for &s;ome years, appeared &s;en&s;ibly to re|lent in his animo&s;ity again&s;t Charles, and to hearken willingly to the apologies made by that prince for the murder of the late duke of Burgundy. His extreme youth was pleaded in his favour; his incapacity to judge for him&s;elf; the a&s;cen|dant gained over him by his mini&s;ters; and his inability to re&s;ent a deed, which, without his knowledge, had been perpetrated by tho&s;e under who&s;e guidance he was then placed. The more to gratify the pride of Philip, the King of France had bani&s;hed from his court and pre&s;ence Tanegui de Chatel, and all tho&s;e concern|ed in that a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination; and had offered to make any other atonement, which could be required of him. The ills, which Charles had already &s;uffered, had tended to gratify the duke's revenge; the mi&s;eries to which France had been &s;o long expo&s;ed, had begun to move his compa&s;&s;ion; and the cries of all Europe admoni&s;hed him, that his re&s;entment, which might hitherto be deemed pious, would, if carried farther, be univer&s;ally condemned as barbarous and unrelenting. While the duke was in this di&s;po&s;ition, every di&s;gu&s;t, which he received from England, made a double impre&s;&s;ion upon him; the entreaties of the count de Richement and the duke of Bourbon, who had married his two &s;i&s;ters, had weight; and he determined finally to unite him&s;elf to the royal family of France, from which his own was de&s;cended. <MILESTONE N="1435" UNIT="year"> For this purpo&s;e, a congre&s;s was appoint|ed at Arras under the mediation of deputies from the Pope and the council of Ba&s;le: The duke of Burgundy came thither in per&s;on: The duke of Bourbon, the count de Richemont and other per&s;ons of high rank, appeared as amba&s;&s;adors from France: And the Engli&s;h having al&s;o been invited to attend, the cardinal of Winche&s;ter, the archbi&s;hop of York, and others, received from the protector and council a commi&s;&s;ion for that purpo&s;e<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, vol. 2. p. 110.</NOTE>.</P>

England offered, that each party &s;hould remain in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what they had at pre&s;ent, after making &s;ome equal ex|changes for mutual convenience: France offered to cede Normandy with Guienne, but both of them loaded with the u&s;ual homage and va&s;&s;alage to the crown. As the claims of England upon France were univer&s;ally unpopular in Europe; the mediators declared the offers of Charles very rea&s;onable; and the cardinal of Winche&s;ter, with the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;adors, immediately left the congre&s;s. There remained nothing but to di&s;cu&s;s the mutual preten&s;ions of Charles and Philip.

Be&s;ides making repeated atonements and acknow|ledgements for the murder of the duke of Burgundy, Charles was obliged to cede all the towns of Picardy which lay between the Somme and the Low Countries; he yielded &s;everal other territories; he agreed, that the&s;e and all the other do|minions of Philip &s;hould be held by him, during his life-time, without doing any homage or &s;wearing fealty to the pre&s;ent King; and he freed his &s;ubjects from all obligations to allegiance, if ever he infringed this treaty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, vol. 2. p. 112.

<P>THE Engli&s;h were &s;till ma&s;ters of many fine provinces in France; but retained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, more by the extreme weakne&s;s of Charles, than by the &s;trength of their own garri&s;ons or the force of their armies. Nothing indeed can be more &s;urprizing than the feeble efforts made, during the cour&s;e of &s;everal years, by the&s;e two potent nations again&s;t each other; while the one &s;truggled for independancy, and the other a&s;pired to a total conque&s;t of its rival. The general want of in|du&s;try, commerce, and police, in that age, had rendered all the European nations, and France and England no le&s;s than the others, unfit for bearing the burthens of war, when it was prolonged beyond one &s;ea&s;on; and the continuance of ho&s;ti|lities had, long ere this time, exhau&s;ted the force and patience of both the&s;e kingdoms. Scarce could the appearance of an army be brought into the field on either &s;ide; and all the operations con&s;i&s;ted in the &s;urprize of places, in the ren|counter of detached parties, and in incur&s;ions upon the open country; which were performed by &s;mall bodies a&s;&s;embled on a &s;udden from the neighbouring garri&s;ons. In this method of conducting the war, the French King had much the advantage: The affections of the people were entirely on his &s;ide: Intelligence was early brought him of the &s;tate and motions of the enemy: The inhabitants were ready to join in any attempts again&s;t the garri&s;ons: And thus ground was continually, tho' &s;lowly, gained again&s;t the Engli&s;h.

It would have been well, had this feeble war, in &s;paring the blood of

this propo&s;al was laid before the council of England, as every que&s;tion was there an object of faction, the party of the duke of Gloce&s;ter, and that of the cardi|nal of Winche&s;ter, were divided in their &s;entiments with regard to it. The duke reminded the council of the dying advice of the late King, that none of the&s;e pri&s;oners &s;hould on any account be relea&s;ed, till his &s;on was of &s;ufficient age to hold, him&s;elf, the reins of government.

And he added, that the relea&s;e of this prince was more likely to be advantageous than prejudicial to the Engli&s;h intere&s;ts; by fill|ing the court of France with faction, and giving a head to tho&s;e numerous male|contents, whom Charles was at pre&s;ent able with great difficulty to re&s;train.

<P><MILESTONE N="1443" UNIT="year"> THE &s;entiments of the cardinal, &s;ome time after, prevailed in another point of &s;till greater moment. That prelate had always encouraged every propo&s;al of ac|commodation with France; and had repre&s;ented the utter impo&s;&s;ibility, in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, of pu&s;hing father the conque&s;ts in that kingdom, and the great difficulty of even maintaining tho&s;e which were already made. He in|&s;i&s;ted on the extreme reluctance of the parliament to grant &s;upplies; the di&s;orders in which the Engli&s;h affairs in Normandy were involved; the daily progre&s;s made by the French King; and the advantage of &s;topping his hand by a tem|porary accommodation, which might leave room for time and accidents to ope|rate in favour of the Engli&s;h. The duke of Gloce&s;ter, high &s;pirited and haughty, and educated in the lo&s;ty preten&s;ions, which the fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;es of his two brothers had rendered familiar to him, could not yet be induced to relinqui&s;h all hopes of prevailing over France; much le&s;s, could he &s;ee with patience, his own opinion thwarted and rejected by the influence of his rival in the Engli&s;h council.

<P>IN proportion as Henry advanced in years, his character became fully known in the court, and was no longer ambiguous to either faction. Of the mo&s;t harm|le&s;s, inoffen&s;ive, &s;imple manners; but of the mo&s;t &s;lender capacity; he was fit|ted, both by the &s;oftne&s;s of his temper, and the weakne&s;s of his under&s;tanding, to be perpetually governed by tho&s;e who &s;urrounded him; and it was ea&s;y to fore|&s;ee, that h s reign would prove a perpetual minority. As he had now reached the twenty-third year of his age, it was natural to think of choo&s;ing him a queen; and each party was ambitious of having him receive one from their hand; as it was probable, that this circum&s;tance would decide forever the victory between them. The duke of Gloce&s;ter propo&s;ed a daughter of the count d'Armagnac; but had not credit to effectuate his purpo&s;e. The cardinal and his friends had ca&s;t their eye on Margaret of Anjou, daughter of Regnier, titular King of Sicily, Naples, and Jeru&s;alem, de&s;cended from the count of Anjou, brother of Charles V. who had left the&s;e magnificent titles, but without any real power or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, to his po&s;terity. This prince&s;s her&s;elf was the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed of her age both in body and mind; and &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e qualities, which would equally qualify her to acquire the a&s;cendant over Henry, and to &s;upply all his defects and weakne&s;&s;es. Of a ma&s;culine, courageous &s;pirit, of an enterprizing temper, en|dowed with &s;olidity as well as vivacity of under&s;tanding, &s;he had not been able to conceal the&s;e great talents even in the privacy of her father's family; and it was rea&s;onable to expect, that, when &s;he &s;hould mount the throne, they would break out with &s;till &s;uperior lu&s;tre. The earl of Suffolk, therefore, in concert with his a&s;&s;ociates of the Engli&s;h council, made propo&s;als of marriage to Margaret, which were accepted. But this nobleman, be&s;ides pre-occupying Margaret's favour by being the chief means of her advancement, endeavoured to ingratiate him&s;elf with her and her family, by very extraordinary conce&s;&s;ions: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage of the King with Margaret of Anjou.</NOTE> Tho' the prince&s;s brought no dowry with her, he ventured of him&s;elf, without any direct authority from the council, but probably with the allowance of the cardinal, and the ruling mem|bers, to engage by a &s;ecret article, that the province of Maine, which was at that

His dutche&s;s, the daughter of Reginald, lord Cob|ham, had been accu&s;ed of the crime of witchcraft, and it was pretended, that a waxen figure of the King was found in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which &s;he and her a&s;&s;oci|ates, &s;ir Roger Bolingbroke a prie&s;t, and one Margery Jordan of Eye, melted in a magical manner before a &s;low fire, with an intention of making Henry's force and vigour wa&s;te away, by like in&s;en&s;ible degrees. The accu&s;ation was well cal|culated to affect the weak and credulous mind of the King, and to gain belief in an ignorant age; and the dutche&s;s was brought to trial with her confederates. The nature of this crime, &s;o oppo&s;ite to all common &s;en&s;e, &s;eems always to ex|empt the accu&s;ers from ob&s;erving the rules of common &s;en&s;e in their evidence: The pri&s;oners were pronounced guilty; the dutche&s;s was condemned to do pub|lic penance, and to &s;uffer perpetual impri&s;onment, and the others were executed<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 381.

But as the&s;e violent proceedings were a&s;cribed &s;olely to the malice of the duke's enemies, the people, contrary to their u&s;ual practice on &s;uch occa&s;ions, acquitted the unhappy &s;ufferers; and encrea&s;ed their e&s;teem and affection towards a prince, who was thus expo&s;ed, without protection, to &s;uch mortal injuries.</P>

Some gentlemen of his retinue were afterwards tried for aiding him in his trea|&s;ons, and were condemned to be hanged, drawn and quartered.

<P>THIS prince is &s;aid to have received a more learned education than was u&s;ual in his age, to have founded one of the fir&s;t public libraries in England, and to have been a great patron of learned men. Among other advantages, which he reaped from this turn of mind, it tended much to cure him of credulity; of which the following in&s;tance is given by Sir Thomas More. There was a man, who pretended, that, tho' he was born blind, he had recovered his &s;ight by touching the &s;hrine of St. Albans.

<P><PB N="357" REF="365">
THAT article of the marriage treaty, by which the province of Maine was to be yielded to Charles of Anjou, the Queen's uncle, had probably been hitherto kept a &s;ecret; and during the life-time of the duke of Gloce&s;ter, it would have been dangerous to venture on the execution of it. But as the court of France in&s;i&s;ted &s;trenuou&s;ly on performance, orders were now di&s;patched, under Henry's hand, to Sir Francis Surienne, governor of Mans, commanding him to &s;urrender that place to Charles of Anjou. Surienne, either que&s;tioning the authenticity of the order, or regarding his government as his only fortune, refu&s;ed compliance; and it became nece&s;&s;ary for a French army under the count de Dunois, to lay &s;iege to the city. The governor made as good a defence as his &s;ituation could permit; but receiving no relief from Edmund duke of Somer&s;et, who was at that time governor of Normandy, he was at la&s;t obliged to capitulate, and to &s;urrender not only Mans, but all the other fortre&s;&s;es of that province, which was thus entirely alienated from the crown of England.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1448" UNIT="year"> THE bad effects of this mea&s;ure &s;topped not here.

But So|mer&s;et, who had no means of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting &s;uch a multitude, and who was proba|bly incen&s;ed at Surienne's di&s;obedience, refu&s;ed to admit him; and this adventurer, not daring to commit depredations on the territories either of the King of France or of England, marched into Brittany, &s;eized the town of Fougeres, repaired the fortifications of Pontor&s;on and St. James de Beuvron, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ted his troops by the ravages, which he committed on all that province<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, vol. 3. p. 6.</NOTE>.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="year"> A WEAK prince, &s;eated on the throne of England, had never failed, how|ever gentle and innocent, to be infe&s;ted with faction, di&s;content, rebellion, and civil commotions; and as the incapacity of Henry appeared every day in a fuller light, the&s;e dangerous con&s;equences began, from pa&s;t experience, to be univer&s;ally and ju&s;tly apprehended. Men al&s;o of unquiet &s;pirits, no longer em|ployed in foreign wars, whence they were now excluded by the &s;ituation of the neighbouring &s;tates, were the more likely to excite inte&s;tine di&s;orders, and by their emulation, rival&s;hip, and animo&s;ities, to tear the bowels of their native country. But tho' the&s;e cau&s;es alone were &s;ufficient to breed confu&s;ion, there concurred ano|ther circum&s;tance of the mo&s;t dangerous nature: A pretender to the crown ap|peared. The title it&s;elf of the weak prince, who enjoyed the name of &s;overeignty, was di&s;puted: And the Engli&s;h were now to pay the &s;evere, tho' late penalty, of their turbulence again&s;t Richard II. and of their levity in violating, without any nece&s;&s;ity or ju&s;t rea&s;on, the lineal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of their monarchs.</P>
<P><PB N="361" REF="369">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Claim of the duke of York to the crown.</NOTE> ALL the males of the hou&s;e of Mortimer were extinct; but Anne, the &s;i&s;ter of the la&s;t earl of Marche, having e&s;pou&s;ed the earl of Cambridge, beheaded in the reign of Henry V. had tran&s;mitted her latent, but not yet forgotten claim to her &s;on, Richard, duke of York. This prince, thus de&s;cended by his mother from Philippa, only daughter of the duke of Clarence, &s;econd &s;on of Edward III. &s;tood plainly in the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion before the King, who derived his de|&s;cent from the duke of Lanca&s;ter, third &s;on of that monarch; and that claim could not, in many re&s;pects, have fallen into more dangerous hands than tho&s;e of the duke of York. Richard was a man of valour and abilities, of a prudent conduct and mild di&s;po&s;itions: He had enjoyed an opportunity of di&s;playing the&s;e virtues in his government of France: And tho' recalled from that com|mand by the intrigues and &s;uperior intere&s;t of the duke of Somer&s;et, he had been &s;ent to &s;uppre&s;s a rebellion in Ireland; had &s;ucceeded much better in that enter|prize than his rival in the defence of Normandy; and had even been able to at|tach to his per&s;on and family, the whole Iri&s;h nation, whom he was &s;ent to &s;ub|due<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 387.</NOTE>. In the right of his father, he bore the rank of fir&s;t prince of the blood; and by this &s;tation, he gave a lu&s;tre to his title derived from the family of Mor|timer, which, tho' of great nobility, was equaled by other families in the king|dom, and had been eclip&s;ed by the royal de&s;cent of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an immen&s;e fortune from the union of &s;o many &s;ucce&s;&s;ions, tho&s;e of Cam|bridge and York on the one hand, with tho&s;e of Mortimer on the other: Which la&s;t inheritance had before been augmented by an union of the e&s;tates of Clarence and Ul&s;ter, with the patrimonial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the family of Marche. The al|liances too of Richard, in marrying the daughter of Ralph Nevil, earl of We&s;t|moreland, had very widely extended his intere&s;t among the nobility, and had procured him many connexions in that formidable order.</P>
<P>THE family of Nevil was perhaps at this time the mo&s;t potent, both from their opulent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and from the characters of the men, that has ever appeared in England. For be&s;ides the earl of We&s;tmoreland, the lords Latimer, Fau|conbridge, and Abergavenny; the earls of Sali&s;bury and Warwic were of that family, and were of them&s;elves, on many accounts, the greate&s;t noblemen of the kingdom. The earl of Sali&s;bury, brother in law to the duke of York, was the elde&s;t &s;on by a &s;econd marriage of the earl of We&s;tmoreland; and inherited by his wife, daughter and heir of Montacute, earl of Sali&s;bury, killed before Or|leans, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and title of that great family. His elde&s;t &s;on, Richard, had married Anne, the daughter and heir of Beauchamp, earl of Warwic, who died governor of France; and by that alliance he enjoyed the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and had
<PB N="362" REF="370">
acquired the title of that other family, one of the mo&s;t opulent, mo&s;t antient, and mo&s;t illu&s;trious of the kingdom. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The earl of Warwic.</NOTE> The per&s;onal qualities al&s;o of the&s;e two earls, e&s;pecially of Warwic, enhanced the &s;plendor of their nobility, and en|crea&s;ed their influence over the people. This latter nobleman, commonly known, from the &s;ub&s;equent events, by the appellation of the <HI>King-maker,</HI> had di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf, by his gallantry in the field, by the ho&s;pitality of his table, by the magnificence, and &s;till more by the genero&s;ity of his expence, and by the &s;pi|rited and bold manner, which attended him in all his actions. The unde&s;igning frankne&s;s and openne&s;s of his character rendered his conque&s;t over mens affections the more certain and infallible: His pre&s;ents were regarded as &s;ure te&s;timonies of e&s;teem and friend&s;hip; and his profe&s;&s;ions as the overflowings of his genuine &s;entiments. No le&s;s than 30,000 people are &s;aid to have daily lived at his board in the different manors and ca&s;tles which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in England: The military men, allured by his munificence and ho&s;pitality, as well as by his bravery, were zealou&s;ly attached to his intere&s;ts: The people in general bore him an unlimited affection: His numerous retainers were more devoted to his will, than to the prince or to the laws: And he was the greate&s;t, as well as the la&s;t, of tho&s;e migh|ty barons, who formerly over-awed the Crown, and rendered the people incapa|ble of any regular &s;y&s;tem of civil government.</P>
<P>BUT the duke of York, be&s;ides the family of Nevil, had many other parti|zans among the great nobility. Courtney, earl of Devon&s;hire, de&s;cended from the royal blood of France, was attached to his intere&s;ts: Moubray, duke of Norfolk, from his hereditary hatred to the family of Lanca&s;ter, had embraced the &s;ame party: And the di&s;contents, which univer&s;ally prevailed among the peo|ple, rendered every combination of the great the more dangerous to the e&s;tabli&s;hed government.</P>
<P>THO' the people were never willing to grant the &s;upplies nece&s;&s;ary for keeping po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the conquered provinces in France, they repined extremely at the lo&s;s of the&s;e boa&s;ted acqui&s;itions; and fancied, becau&s;e a &s;udden irruption could make conque&s;ts, that, without &s;teddy coun&s;els and an uniform expence, it was po&s;&s;ible to maintain them. The voluntary ce&s;&s;ion of Maine to the queen's uncle, had made them &s;u&s;pect treachery in the lo&s;s of Normandy and Guienne. They &s;till con&s;idered Margaret as a French woman and a latent enemy of the king|dom. And when they &s;aw her father and all her relations active in promoting the &s;ucce&s;s of the French, they could not be per&s;uaded, that &s;he, who was all powerful in the Engli&s;h council, would very zealou&s;ly oppo&s;e them in their en|terprizes.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="371">
BUT the mo&s;t fatal blow, which was given to the popularity of the crown and to the intere&s;ts of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, was by the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of the virtu|ous duke of Gloce&s;ter, who&s;e character, had he been alive, would have kept in awe the partizans of York, but who&s;e memory, being extremely cheri&s;hed by the people, &s;erved to throw an infinite odium on all his murderers. By this event, the reigning family &s;uffered a double prejudice: It was deprived of its firme&s;t &s;upport; and it was loaded with all the infamy of that imprudent and barbarous execution.</P>
<P>As the duke of Suffolk was known to have had an active hand in this crime, he partook deeply of the hatred, which attended it; and the clamours, which nece&s;&s;arily ro&s;e again&s;t him, as prime mini&s;ter and declared favourite of the queen, were thereby augmented to a ten-fold pitch, and became ab&s;olutely uncontroleable. The great nobility could ill brook to &s;ee a &s;ubject exalted above them; much more one who was only great grand&s;on to a merchant, and who was of a birth &s;o much inferior to theirs. The people complained of his arbitrary mea&s;ures; which were, in &s;ome degree, a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the irregular power then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the prince, but which the lea&s;t di&s;affection ea&s;i|ly magnified into tyranny. The immen&s;e acqui&s;itions, which he daily made, were the object of envy; and as they were made at the expence of the crown, which was it&s;elf reduced to the mo&s;t &s;candalous poverty, they appeared on that account, to all indifferent per&s;ons, the more exceptionable and invidious.</P>
<P>THE revenues of the crown, which had long been di&s;proportioned to its power and dignity, had been extremely dilapidated during the minority of Henry<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 609.</NOTE>; both by the rapacity of the courtiers, which the King's uncles could not controul, and by the nece&s;&s;ary expences of the French war, which had always been &s;o ill &s;upplied by the grants of parliament. The royal deme&s;nes were di&s;&s;ipated, and at the &s;ame time the King was loaded with a debt of 372,000 pounds, a &s;um &s;o immen&s;e, that the parliament could never think of di&s;charging it. This unhap|py &s;ituation forced the mini&s;ters upon many arbitrary mea&s;ures: The hou&s;ehold it&s;elf could not be &s;upported without &s;tretching to the utmo&s;t the right of pur|veyance, and rendering it a kind of univer&s;al robbery upon the people: The pub|lic clamour ro&s;e high upon this occa&s;ion, and no one had the equity to make al|lowance for the nece&s;&s;ity of the King's &s;ituation. Suffolk, once become odious, bore the blame of the whole; and every grievance in every part of the admini|&s;tration was univer&s;ally imputed to his tyranny and inju&s;tice.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Impeachment of the duke of Suffolk.</NOTE> THIS nobleman, &s;en&s;ible of the public hatred under which he laboured, and for&s;eeing an attack from the commons, endeavoured to overawe his enemies, by boldly pre&s;enting him&s;elf to the charge, and by in&s;i&s;ting upon his own innocence, and even upon his merits and tho&s;e of his family in the public &s;ervice. He ro&s;e up in the hou&s;e of peers; took notice of the clamours propagated again&s;t him; and complained, that, after &s;erving the crown in thirty four campaigns, after &s;taying abroad &s;eventeen years without once returning to his own country; after lo&s;ing a father and three brothers in the wars with France; after being him&s;elf a pri&s;o|ner, and purcha&s;ing his liberty by a large ran&s;om; it &s;hould yet be &s;u&s;pected, that he had been debauched from his allegiance by that enemy whom he had ever op|po&s;ed with &s;uch zeal and fortitude, and that he had betrayed his prince, who had rewarded his &s;ervices by the highe&s;t honours and greate&s;t offices, which it was in his power to confer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 641.</NOTE>. This &s;peech did not an&s;wer the purpo&s;e intended. The commons, rather the more provoked at his challenge, opened their charge again&s;t Suffolk, and &s;ent up to the hou&s;e of peers an accu&s;ation of high trea&s;on, divided into &s;everal articles. They in&s;i&s;ted, that he had per&s;uaded the French King to invade England with an armed force, in order to depo&s;e the King, to place on the throne his own &s;on, John de la Pole, whom he intended to marry to Margaret, the only daughter of the late John, duke of Somer&s;et, and to whom, he imagined, he would by that means acquire a title to the crown: That he had contributed to the relea&s;e of the duke of Orleans, in hopes, that that prince would aid and a&s;&s;i&s;t King Charles in expelling the Engli&s;h from France, and recovering full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his kingdom: That he had afterwards encouraged that King to make open war on Normandy and Guienne, and had pro|moted his conque&s;ts by betraying the &s;ecrets of England, and ob&s;tructing the &s;uccours propo&s;ed to be &s;ent over to tho&s;e provinces: And that he had, without any powers or commi&s;&s;ion, promi&s;ed by treaty to deliver up the provinces of Maine to Charles of Anjou, and had accordingly delivered it up; a conce&s;&s;ion, which proved in the i&s;&s;ue the chief cau&s;e of the lo&s;s of Normandy<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 642. Hall, fol. 157. Holing&s;hed, p. 631. Graf|ton, p. 607.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is evident, from a review of the&s;e articles, that the commons adopted without enquiry all the popular clamours again&s;t the duke of Suffolk, and charg|ed him with crimes, of which none but the vulgar could &s;eriou&s;ly believe him guilty. Nothing can be more incredible, than that a nobleman of his rank and character could think of acquiring the crown to his family, and of depo&s;ing Hen|ry by foreign force, and together with him, Margaret, his patron, a prince&s;s of &s;o much &s;pirit and penetration. Suffolk appealed to many noblemen in the hou&s;e,
<PB N="365" REF="373">
who knew, that he had intended to marry his &s;on to one of the co-heirs of the earl of Warwic, and was di&s;appointed in his de&s;ign only by the death of that lady: And he ob&s;erved, that Margaret of Somer&s;et could bring to her hu&s;band no title to the crown; becau&s;e &s;he her&s;elf was not &s;o much as comprehended in the entail, &s;ettled by act of parliament. It is ea&s;y to account for the lo&s;s of Nor|mandy and Guienne from the &s;ituation of affairs in the two kingdoms, without &s;uppo&s;ing any treachery in the Engli&s;h mini&s;ters; and it may &s;afely be affirmed, that greater vigour of council was requi&s;ite to defend them from the arms of Charles VII. than to conquer them at fir&s;t from his predece&s;&s;or. It could never be the intere&s;t of any Engli&s;h mini&s;ter to betray and abandon the&s;e provinces; much le&s;s of one, who was &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed in his ma&s;ter's favour, who enjoyed &s;uch high honours and ample po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in his own country, who had nothing to dread but the effects of popular hatred, and who could never think, without the mo&s;t extreme reluctance, of becoming a fugitive and exile in a foreign land. The only article, which carries any face of probability, is his engagement for the delivery of Maine to Charles of Anjou; but Suffolk maintained, with great appearance of truth, that this mea&s;ure was known and con&s;ented to by &s;everal at the council board<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 643.</NOTE>; and it &s;eems hard to a&s;cribe to it, as is done by the parliament, the &s;ub&s;equent lo&s;s of Normandy and expul&s;ion of the Engli&s;h. Normandy lay open on every &s;ide to the inva&s;ion of the French: Maine, an inland province, mu&s;t &s;oon after have fallen without any attack: And as the Engli&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in other parts more fortre&s;&s;es than they could garri&s;on or provide for, it &s;eemed no bad policy to contract their force, and to render the defence practicable, by re|ducing it into &s;maller compa&s;s.</P>
<P>THE commons were probably &s;en&s;ible, that this charge of trea&s;on again&s;t Suf|folk would not bear a &s;trict &s;crutiny; and they therefore &s;ent up, &s;oon after, a new charge of mi&s;demeanours, which they al&s;o divided into &s;everal articles. They affirmed, among other imputations, that he had procured exorbitant grants from the crown, had embezzled the public money, had conferred offices on improper per&s;ons, had perverted ju&s;tice by maintaining iniquitous cau&s;es, and had procur|ed pardons to notorious offenders<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 643.</NOTE>. The articles are mo&s;tly general; but are not improbable: And as Suffolk &s;eems to have been a bad man and a bad mini&s;ter, it will not be ra&s;h in us to think, that he was guilty, and that many of the&s;e ar|ticles could have been proved again&s;t him. The court was alarmed at the pro|&s;ecution of a favourite mini&s;ter, who lay under &s;uch a load of popular prejudi|ces; and an expedient was fallen upon to &s;ave him from pre&s;ent ruin. The King &s;ent for all the lords, &s;piritual and temporal, to his apartment: The pri&s;o|ner
<PB N="366" REF="374">
was produced before them, and a&s;ked what he could &s;ay in his own defence: He denied the charge; but &s;ubmitted to the King's mercy: Henry expre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf not to be &s;atisfied with regard to the fir&s;t bill of trea&s;ons; <NOTE PLACE="marg">H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> ban<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">h|ment</NOTE> b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t in con&s;ideration of the &s;econd of mi&s;demeanors, he declared, that, by virtue of Suffolk's own &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion, not by any judicial authority, he bani&s;hed him the kingdom during five years. The lords remained &s;ilent, but &s;o &s;oon as they returned to their own hou&s;e, they entered a prote&s;t, that this &s;entence &s;hould no wi&s;e infringe their pri|vileges, and that if Suffolk had in&s;i&s;ted upon his right, and had not &s;ubmitted voluntarily to the King's orders, he was intitled to a trial by his peers in parli|ment.</P>
<P>IT was ea&s;y to &s;ee, that the&s;e irregular proceedings were meant to favour Suf|folk, and that, as he &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Queen's confidence, he would, on the fir&s;t favourable opportunity, be re&s;tored to his country, and be re-in&s;tated in his former power and credit. A captain of a ve&s;&s;el was therefore employed by his enemies to intercept him in his pa&s;&s;age to France: <NOTE PLACE="marg">and death</NOTE> He was &s;eized near Dover; his head &s;truck off on the &s;ide of a long boat, and his body thrown into the &s;ea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 158. Hi&s;t. Croyland. contin. p. 525. Stowe, p. 388. Grafton, p. 610.</NOTE>. No enquiry was made after the authors and accomplices of this atrocious act of violence.</P>
<P>THE duke of Somer&s;et &s;ucceeded to Suffolk's power in the mini&s;try, and cre|dit with the Queen; and as he was the per&s;on, in who&s;e hands the French pro|vinces were lo&s;t, the public, who judge always by the event, &s;oon made him equally the object of their animo&s;ity and hatred. The duke of York was ab&s;ent in Ire|land during all the&s;e tran&s;actions; and however it might be &s;u&s;pected, that his partizans had excited and &s;upported the pro&s;ecution of Suffolk, no immediate ground of complaint could, on that account, he again&s;t him. But there happen|ed &s;oon after an incident, which rouzed the jealou&s;y of the court, and di&s;covered to them the extreme danger, to which they were expo&s;ed from the preten&s;ions of that wi&s;e and popular prince.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> THE humours of the people, &s;et afloat by the parliamentary impeachment, and by the fall of &s;o great a favourite as Suffolk, broke out in various commotions, which were &s;oon &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; but there aro&s;e one in Kent, which was likely to have been attended with more dangerous con&s;equences. A man of low condition, one John Cade, a native of Ireland, who had been obliged to fly into France for his crimes, ob&s;erved on his return the di&s;contents of the people; and he laid on them the foundation of projects, which were at fir&s;t attended with &s;urprizing &s;uc|ce&s;s. He took the name of John Mortimer, intending, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, to pa&s;s him&s;elf for a &s;on of that &s;ir John Mortimer, who had been &s;entenced to death by

Cotton, p. 564. This author admires, that &s;uch a piece of inju&s;tice &s;hould have been committed in peaceable times: He might have added, and by &s;uch virtuous princes as Bedford and Gloce&s;ter. But it is to be pre&s;umed, that Mortimer was guilty: tho' his condemnation was highly irregular and illegal. The people had at this time a very &s;eeble &s;en&s;e of law and a con&s;titution; and power was very imperfectly re&s;trained by the&s;e limits. When the proceedings of a parliament were &s;o irregular, it is ea&s;y to imagine, that tho&s;e of a king would be more &s;o.</NOTE>. On the fir&s;t mention of that popular name, the common people of Kent, to the num|ber of 20,000, flocked to Cade's &s;tandard; and he excited their zeal, by pub|li&s;hing complaints again&s;t the numerous abu&s;es of government, and demanding redre&s;s of their grievances. The court, not yet fully &s;en&s;ible of the danger, &s;ent a &s;mall force again&s;t the rioters, under the command of &s;ir Humphrey Stafford, who was defeated and &s;lain in an action near Sevenoke<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hall. fol. 159.

Tho' elated by his victory, he &s;till maintained the appearance of moderation; and &s;ending the court a very plau&s;ible li&s;t of grievances<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p 388, 389. Holing&s;hed, p 633.</NOTE>, he promi&s;ed, that, when the&s;e were redre&s;&s;ed, and when lord Say, the trea&s;urer, and Cromer, high &s;heriff of Kent, were puni&s;hed for their malver&s;ations, he would immediately lay down his arms. The council, who ob&s;erved, that nobody was willing to fight again&s;t men &s;o rea|&s;onable in their preten&s;ions, carried the King, for pre&s;ent &s;afety, to Kenilworth; and the city immediately opened their gates to Cade, who maintained, during &s;ome time, great order and di&s;cipline among his followers. He always led them out into the fields during the night-time; and publi&s;hed &s;evere edicts again&s;t plun|der and violence of every kind: But being obliged, in order to gratify their malevolence again&s;t Say and Cromer, to put the&s;e mini&s;ters to death without a legal trial<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 610.</NOTE>, he found, that, after the commi&s;&s;ion of this crime, he was no longer ma&s;ter of their riotous di&s;po&s;ition, and that all his orders were neglected<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 160.</NOTE>. They broke into a rich hou&s;e, which they plundered; and the citizens, alarmed with this act of violence, &s;hut their gates again&s;t them, and being &s;econded by a de|tachment of &s;oldiers, &s;ent them by lord Scales, governor of the tower, they re|pul&s;ed the in&s;urgents with great &s;laughter<NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Croyl contin. p. 526.</NOTE>. The Kenti&s;hmen were &s;o di&s;cou|raged with this blow, that, upon receiving a general pardon from the primate then chancellor, they retreated towards Roche&s;ter, and then di&s;per&s;ed. The par|don was &s;oon after annulled, as being extorted by violence: A price was &s;et on Cade's head<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 11. p. 275.</NOTE>, who was killed by one Iden, a gentleman of Su&s;&s;ex; and many of his followers were capitally puni&s;hed for their rebellion.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The parties of Lanca&s;ter and York.</NOTE> THE partizans of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter maintained, that tho' the exaltation of Henry IV. might at fir&s;t be deemed &s;omewhat irregular, and could not be ju&s;tified by any of tho&s;e principles, on which that prince cho&s;e to re&s;t his title, it was yet founded on general con&s;ent, was a national act, and was derived from the voluntary approbation of a free people, who, being loo&s;ened from their alle|giance by the tyranny of the preceding government, were moved by gratitude, as well as by a &s;en&s;e of public intere&s;t, to commit the &s;ceptre into the hands of their deliverer: That even if that e&s;tabli&s;hment were allowed to be at fir&s;t invalid, it had acquired &s;olidity by time, the only principle which ultimately gives autho|rity to government, and removes tho&s;e &s;cruples, which the irregular &s;teps, attend|ing all revolutions, naturally excite in the minds of the people: That the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was a rule admitted only for general good, and for the maintenance of public order; and could never be pleaded to the overthrow of national tran|quility, and the &s;ubver&s;ion of regular e&s;tabli&s;hments: That the principles of li|berty, no le&s;s than the maxims of internal peace, were injured by the&s;e preten&s;ions of the hou&s;e of York; and if &s;o many re-iterated acts of the legi&s;lature, by which the crown was entailed on the pre&s;ent family, were now invalidated, the Engli&s;h nation mu&s;t be con&s;idered, not as a free people who could di&s;po&s;e of their own

government, but as a troop of &s;laves, who were implicitly tran&s;mitted by &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion from one hand to another: That the nation was bound to allegiance un|der the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter by moral, no le&s;s than by political duty; and were they to infringe tho&s;e numerous oaths of fealty, which they had &s;worn to Henry and his numerous predece&s;&s;ors, they would thenceforth be &s;o thrown loo&s;e from all principles, that it would be found difficult ever after to &s;ix and re&s;train them: That the duke of York him&s;elf had frequently done homage to the King as his lawful &s;overeign, and had thereby, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, made an indirect renunciation of tho&s;e claims, with which he now dared to di&s;turb the tranquility of the public: That even tho' the violation of the rights of blood, made on the depo&s;ition of Richard, was perhaps ra&s;h and imprudent, it was now too late to remedy the mi&s;chief; the danger of a di&s;puted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion could no longer be ob|viated; the people, accu&s;tomed to a government, which, in the hands of the late King, had been &s;o glorious, and in that of his predece&s;&s;or, &s;o prudent and &s;alu|tary, would &s;till a&s;cribe a right to it; by cau&s;ing multiplied di&s;orders, and by &s;hed|ding an inundation of blood, the advantage would only be obtained, of exchang|ing one pretender for another; and the hou&s;e of York it&s;elf, if e&s;tabli&s;hed on the throne, would, on the fir&s;t opportunity, be expo&s;ed to tho&s;e revolutions, which the giddy &s;pirit, excited in the people, gave &s;o much rea&s;on to apprehend: And that tho' the pre&s;ent King enjoyed not the &s;hining talents, which had appeared in his father and grandfather, he might &s;till have a &s;on, who &s;hould be endowed with them; he was him&s;elf eminent for the mo&s;t harmle&s;s and inoffen&s;ive manners; and if active princes were dethroned on pretence of tyranny, and indolent ones on the plea of incapacity, there would thenceforth remain in the con&s;titution no &s;ettled and e&s;tabli&s;hed rule of obedience to any &s;overeign.</P>
<P>THESE &s;trong topics in favour of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, were oppo&s;ed by ar|guments no le&s;s convincing on the &s;ide of the hou&s;e of York. The partizans of this latter family a&s;&s;erted, that the maintenance of order in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of prin|ces, &s;o far from incroaching on the rights of the people, or invalidating their fun|damental title to good government, was e&s;tabli&s;hed only for the purpo&s;es of go|vernment, and &s;erved to prevent tho&s;e numberle&s;s confu&s;ions, which mu&s;t en&s;ue, if no rule was followed but the uncertain and di&s;puted views of pre&s;ent conveni|ence and advantage: That the &s;ame maxims, which en&s;ured the public peace, were al&s;o &s;alutary to national liberty; the privileges of the people could only be maintained by the ob&s;ervance of laws; and if no account was made of the rights of the &s;overeign, it could le&s;s be expected, that any regard would be paid to the property and freedom of the &s;ubject: That it was never too late to correct any pernicious precedent; an unju&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment, the longer it &s;tood, acquired the

greater &s;anction and validity; it could, with more appearance of rea&s;on, be pleaded as an authority for a like inju&s;tice; and the maintenance of it, in&s;tead of favouring public tranquility, tended to disjoint every principle, by which human &s;ociety was &s;upported: That u&s;urpers would be happy, if their pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power, or their continuance for a few years, could convert them into legal princes; but nothing would be more mi&s;erable than the people, if all re&s;traints on violence and ambition were thus removed, and a full &s;cope given to the at|tempts of every turbulent innovator: That time indeed be&s;towed a &s;olidity on go|vernment, who&s;e fir&s;t foundation was the mo&s;t infirm; but it acquired a long cour&s;e of time to operate this effect, and the total extinction of tho&s;e claimants, who&s;e title was built on the original principles of the con&s;titution: That the depo&s;ition of Richard, and the advancement of Henry IV. were not deliberate national acts; but the re&s;ult of the levity and violence of the people, and proceeded from tho&s;e very defects in human nature, which the e&s;tabli&s;hment of political &s;ociety, and of an order in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, was calculated to prevent: That the &s;ub&s;equent entails of the crown were a continuance of the &s;ame violence and u&s;urpation; they were not ratified by the legi&s;lature, &s;ince the con&s;ent of the rightful King was &s;till wanting; and the acquie&s;cence, fir&s;t of the family of Mortimer, then of that of the family of York, proceeded from pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity, and implied no renunciation of their preten&s;ions: That the re&s;toration of that order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, could not be con&s;i|dered as a change, which familiarized the people to revolutions; but as a cor|rection of former changes, which had it&s;elf encouraged the giddy &s;pirit of inno|vation, rebellion, and di&s;obedience: And that as the original title of Lanca&s;ter &s;tood only, in the per&s;on of Henry IV. on pre&s;ent convenience, even this principle, unju&s;tifiable as it was, when not &s;upported by laws, and warranted by the con&s;titution, had now entirely gone over to the other &s;ide; nor was there any com|pari&s;on between a prince utterly unable to &s;way the &s;cepter, and governed entirely by corrupt mini&s;ters, or by an imperious Queen, engaged in foreign and ho&s;tile intere&s;ts; and a prince of mature years, of approved wi&s;dom and experience, a native of England, the lineal heir of the crown, who by his re&s;toration would replace every thing on their antient foundations.</P>
<P>So many plau&s;ible arguments could be urged on both &s;ides of this intere&s;ting que&s;tion, that the people were extremely divided in their &s;entiments; and tho' the noblemen of greate&s;t power and influence &s;eem to have embraced the party of York, the oppo&s;ite cau&s;e had the advantage of being &s;upported by the pre&s;ent laws, and by the immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of royal authority. There were al&s;o many great noblemen of the Lanca&s;trian party, who ballanced the power of their anta|goni&s;ts; and kept the nation in &s;u&s;pence between them. The earl of Northum|berland
<PB N="371" REF="379">
adhered to the pre&s;ent government: The earl of We&s;tmoreland, in &s;pite of his connections with the duke of York, and with the family of Nevil, of which he was the head, was brought over to the &s;ame party; and the whole north of England, the mo&s;t warlike part of the kingdom, was, by means of the&s;e two potent noblemen, engaged warmly in the intere&s;ts of Lanca&s;ter, Edmund Beaufort, duke of Somer&s;et, and his brother Henry, were great &s;upports of that cau&s;e; as were al&s;o Henry Holland, duke of Exeter, Stafford, duke of Buckingham, the earl of Shrew&s;bury, the lord Clifford, lord Dudley, lord Scales, lord Audley, and other noblemen.</P>
<P>WHILE the kingdom was in this &s;ituation, it might naturally be expected, that &s;o many turbulent barons, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o much independant authority, would immediately have flown to arms, and have decided the quarrel, after their u&s;ual manner, by war and battle, under the &s;tandard of the contending princes. But there were &s;till many cau&s;es, which retarded the&s;e de&s;perate ex|tremities, and made a long train of faction, intrigue and cabal, precede the mi|litary operations. By the gradual progre&s;s of arts in England, as well as in other parts of Europe, the people were now become of &s;ome con&s;equence; laws were beginning to be re&s;pected by them; and it was requi&s;ite, by various pretences, previou&s;ly to reconcile their minds to the overthrow of &s;uch an antient e&s;tabli&s;h|ment as that of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, ere their concurrence could rea&s;onably be expected. The duke of York him&s;elf, the new claimant, was of a very mo|derate and cautious character, an enemy to violence, and inclined to tru&s;t rather to time and policy, than to &s;anguinary mea&s;ures, for the &s;ucce&s;s of his preten&s;ions. The very imbecillity it&s;elf of Henry tended to keep the factions in &s;u&s;pence, and made them &s;tand long in awe of each other: It rendered the Lanca&s;trian party unable to &s;trike any violent blow again&s;t their enemies; it encouraged the York|i&s;ts to hope, that, after bani&s;hing the King's mini&s;ters, and getting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his per&s;on, they might gradually undermine his authority, and be able, with|out the perilous experiment of a civil war, to change the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, by parlia|mentary and legal authority.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1456" UNIT="year"> IT was not found difficult to wre&s;t power from hands &s;o little tenacious as tho&s;e of the duke of York.

The duke of York acquie&s;ced in this deci&s;ion: Henry him&s;elf, being a pri&s;oner, could not oppo&s;e it: Even if he had enjoyed his liberty, he would not probably have felt any violent reluctance again&s;t it: And the act thus pa&s;&s;ed with the unanimous con&s;ent of the whole legi&s;lative body. Tho' the mildne&s;s of this compromi&s;e is chiefly to be a&s;cribed to the moderation of the duke of York, it is impo&s;&s;ible not to ob&s;erve in tho&s;e tran&s;actions vi&s;ible marks of a higher regard to law, and a more fixed authority, enjoyed by parliament, than has appeared in any former period of Engli&s;h hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>IT is probable, that the duke of York, without employing either menaces or violence, could have obtained from the commons a &s;ettlement more con&s;i&s;tent and uniform: But as many, if not all the members of the upper hou&s;e, had re|ceived grants, conce&s;&s;ions, or dignities, during the la&s;t &s;ixty years, when the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the government, they were afraid of inva|lidating their own titles by too &s;udden and violent an overthrow of that family; and in thus temporizing between the parties, they fixed the throne on a ba&s;is, up|on which it could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;tand. The duke, apprehending his chief dan|ger to ari&s;e from the genius and &s;pirit of Queen Margaret, &s;ought a pretence for bani&s;hing her entirely the kingdom; and for that purpo&s;e, he &s;ent her, in the King's name, a &s;ummons to come immediately to London; intending, in ca&s;e of her di&s;obedience, to proceed to extremities again&s;t her. But the queen needed not this menace to excite her activity in behalf of the rights of her family. After the defeat at Northampton, &s;he had fled with her infant &s;on to Durham, and from thence to Scotland; but &s;oon returning, &s;he applied to the northern barons, and employed every motive to procure their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Her affability, in&s;inuation, and addre&s;s, qualities in which &s;he excelled; her care&s;&s;es, her promi&s;es wrought a powerful effect on every one who approached her: The admiration of her great qualities was &s;ucceeded by compa&s;&s;ion towards her helple&s;s condition: The nobility of that quarter, who regarded them&s;elves as the mo&s;t warlike of the kingdom, were moved by indignation to find the &s;outhern barons di&s;po&s;e of the crown and &s;ettle the government: And that they might allure the people to their &s;tandard, they promi&s;ed them the &s;poils of all the provinces on the other &s;ide the Trent. By the&s;e means, the Queen had collected an army twenty thou&s;and &s;trong, with a celerity which was neither expected by her friends, nor apprehended by her enemies.</P>

But the duke, tho' deficient in political courage, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed per&s;onal bravery to an eminent degree; and notwith&s;tanding all his wi&s;dom and experience, he thought, that he &s;hould be forever di&s;graced, if, by taking &s;helter behind walls, he &s;hould for a moment re&s;ign the victory to a woman. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> He de&s;cended into the plain, and offered battle to the enemy, which was in&s;tantly accepted.

While the armies were warmly engaged, Lovelace, who commanded a con&s;iderable body of the Yorki&s;ts, treacherou&s;ly withdrew from the combat; and this di&s;honourable action, of which there are many in&s;tances in the&s;e civil wars, decided the victory in favour of the Queen. About 2300 of the Yorki&s;ts peri&s;hed in the battle and flight; and the per&s;on of the King fell again into the hands of his own party. This weak prince was &s;ure to be almo&s;t equally a pri&s;oner whichever party had the keeping of him; and &s;carce any more decorum was ob&s;erved by the one than by the other in their method of treating him.

<P>THE Queen made no great advantage of this victory: Young Edward ad|vanced upon her from the other &s;ide; and collecting the remains of Warwic's army, was &s;oon in a condition of giving her battle with &s;uperior forces.

Edward en|tered London amid&s;t the acclamations of the citizens, and immediately opened a new &s;cene to his party. This prince, in the bloom of youth, remarkable for the beauty of his per&s;on, for his bravery, his activity, his affability, and every popu|lar quality, found him&s;elf &s;o much po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of public favour, that, elated with the &s;pirit, natural to his age, he re&s;olved no longer to confine him&s;elf within tho&s;e narrow limits, which his father had pre&s;cribed to him&s;elf, and which had been found by experience &s;o prejudicial to his cau&s;e. He determined to a&s;&s;ume the name and dignity of King; to in&s;i&s;t openly on his claim; and thenceforth, to treat the oppo&s;ite party as traitors and rebels to his lawful authority.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><MILESTONE N="1461" UNIT="year"> YOUNG Edward, now in his twentieth year, was of a temper well fitted to make his way thro' &s;uch a &s;cene of war, havoc, and deva&s;tation, as mu&s;t conduct him to the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that crown, which he claimed from heredi|tary right, but which he had a&s;&s;umed from the tumultuary election alone of his own party. He was bold, active, enterprizing; and his hardne&s;s of heart and &s;everity of character rendered him impregnable to all tho&s;e movements of com|pa&s;&s;ion, which might relax his vigour in the pro&s;ecution of the mo&s;t bloody re|venges again&s;t his enemies. The very commencement of his reign gave &s;ymp|toms of his &s;anguinary di&s;po&s;ition. A trade&s;man of London, who kept &s;hop at the &s;ign of the crown, having &s;aid, that he would make his &s;on heir to the crown; this harmle&s;s plea&s;antry was interpreted to be &s;poke in deri&s;ion of Edward's a&s;|&s;umed title; and he was condemned and executed for the offence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Habington in Kennet, p. 431.

implacable. The people, divided in their affections, took al&s;o oppo&s;ite &s;ymbols of party: The partizans of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter cho&s;e the red ro&s;e as their mark of di&s;tinction; tho&s;e of York were denominated from the white; and the&s;e civil wars were thus known, all over Europe, by the name of the quarrel between the two ro&s;es.</P>
<P>THE licence, in which queen Margaret had been obliged to indulge her troops, &s;truck a great terror into the city of London and all the &s;outhern parts of the kingdom; and as &s;he there expected a very ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, &s;he prudently retired northwards among her own partizans. The &s;ame licence, joined to the zeal of faction, &s;oon brought great multitudes to her &s;tandard; and &s;he was able, in a few days, to a&s;&s;emble an army &s;ixty thou&s;and &s;trong in York&s;hire. The King and the earl of Warwic made ha&s;te, with an army of forty thou&s;and, to check her progre&s;s; and when they reached Pomfret, they di&s;patched a body of troops, under the command of the lord Fitzwalter, to &s;ecure the pa&s;&s;age of Ferrybridge over the river Are, which lay between them and the enemy. Fitz|walter took po&s;t at the place a&s;&s;igned him; but was not able to defend it again&s;t lord Clifford, who attacked him with &s;uperior numbers. The Yorki&s;ts were chaced over the river with great &s;laughter; and lord Fitzwalter him&s;elf was &s;lain in the action<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">W. Wyrce&s;ter, p. 489. Hall, fol. 186.

The earl of Warwic, dreading the con&s;equences of this misfor|tune, at a time when a deci&s;ive action was every hour expected, immediately or|dered his hor&s;e to be brought him, which he &s;tabbed before the whole army; and ki&s;&s;ing the hilt of his &s;word, &s;wore, that he was determined to &s;hare the fate of the meane&s;t &s;oldier<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Habington, p. 432.</NOTE>.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Touton. 29th of Mar.</NOTE> THE two ho&s;tile armies met at Touton; and a fierce and bloody battle en&s;ued. While the Yorki&s;ts were advancing to the charge, there happened a great fall of &s;now, which, driving full on the faces of their enemies, blinded them; and this advantage was improved by a &s;tratagem of lord Falconbridge. That nobleman ordered &s;ome infantry to advance before the line, and after having &s;ent a volley of flight-arrows, as they were called, amid&s;t the enemy, immediately to retire.

Habington, p. 433.</NOTE>. The earl of Devon|&s;hire, who was now engaged in Henry's party, was brought a pri&s;oner to Ed|ward; and was &s;oon after beheaded by martial law at York. His head was fix|ed on a pole erected over the gates of that city; and the head of duke Richard and that of the earl of Sali&s;bury were taken down, and buried with their bodies. Henry and Margaret had remained at York during the action; but learning the defeat of their army, and being &s;en&s;ible, that no place in England could now afford them &s;helter, they fled with great precipitation into Scotland. They were accompanied by the duke of Exeter, who, tho' he had married Edward's &s;i&s;ter, had taken part with the Lanca&s;trians, and by Henry duke of Somer&s;et, who had commanded in the unfortunate battle of Touton, and who was the &s;on of that nobleman killed in the fir&s;t battle of St. Albans.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Henry e&s;capes into Scotland.</NOTE> NOTWITHSTANDING the great animo&s;ity, which prevailed between the two kingdoms, Scotland had never exerted it&s;elf with vigour, to take advantage either of the wars which England carried on with France, or of the civil wars which broke out between the contending families. James I. more laudably employed, in civilizing his &s;ubjects and taming them to the &s;alutary yoke of law and ju&s;tice, avoided all ho&s;tilities with foreign nations; and tho' he &s;eemed intere&s;ted to main|tain a ballance between France and England, he gave no farther a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the former kingdom in its greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;es, than permitting, and perhaps encouraging, his &s;ubjects to inli&s;t in the French &s;ervice. After the murder of that excellent prince, the minority of his &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or, James II. and the di&s;tractions incident to it, retained the Scots in the &s;ame &s;tate of neutrality; and the &s;uperiority, vi&s;ibly acquired by France, rendered it then unnece&s;&s;ary for her ally to interpo&s;e in her defence. But when the quarrel commenced between the hou&s;es of York and Lanca&s;ter, and became ab&s;olutely incurable but by the total extinction of one party; James, who had now ri&s;en to man's e&s;tate, was tempted
<PB N="388" REF="396">
to &s;eize this advantage, and he endeavoured to recover tho&s;e places, which the Engli&s;h had formerly conquered from his ance&s;tors. He laid &s;iege to the ca&s;tle of Roxborough in 1460, and had provided him&s;elf of a &s;mall train of artillery for that enterprize: But his cannon were &s;o ill framed, that one of them bur&s;t as he was firing it, and put an end to his life in the flower of his age. His &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or, James III. was al&s;o a minor: The u&s;ual di&s;tractions en&s;ued in the go|vernment: The queen dowager, Anne of Gueldres, a&s;pired to the regency: The family of Douglas oppo&s;ed her preten&s;ions: And queen Margaret, when &s;he fled into Scotland, found there a people little le&s;s divided by faction than tho&s;e by whom &s;he had been expelled. Tho' &s;he pleaded the connexions between the roy|al family of Scotland and the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, by the young King's grand|mother, who was a daughter of the earl of Somer&s;et; &s;he could engage the Scots council to go no farther than to expre&s;s their good wi&s;hes in her favour: But on her offer to deliver to them immediately the important fortre&s;s of Berwic, and to contract her &s;on in marriage with a &s;i&s;ter of King James's, &s;he found a better re|ception; and the Scots promi&s;ed the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their arms to re-in&s;tate her fa|mily upon the throne<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 137. Habington, p. 434.</NOTE>. But as the danger from that quarter &s;eemed not very urgent to Edward, he did not pur&s;ue the fugitive King and Queen into their re|treat; but returned to London, where a parliament was &s;ummoned for &s;ettling the government.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">4th of Novr.

They recognized the title of Edward to the crown, by hereditary de&s;cent, thro' the family of Mortimer; and declared that he was King in right, from the death of his father, who had al&s;o the &s;ame lawful title; and that he was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne from the day that he a&s;&s;umed the government, tendered to him by the acclamations of the people<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 670.</NOTE>. They expre&s;&s;ed their abhorrence of the u&s;urpation and intru&s;ion of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, particularly that of the earl of Derby, otherwi&s;e called Henry IV. which, they &s;aid, had been attended with every kind of di&s;order, the murder of the &s;overeign and the oppre&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubjects. They annulled every grant which had pa&s;&s;ed in tho&s;e reigns; they rein&s;tated the King in all the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions, which had belonged to the crown at the pretended depo&s;ition of Rich|ard II. and tho' they confirmed judicial deeds and the decrees of inferior courts,
<PB N="389" REF="397">
they rever&s;ed all attainders pa&s;&s;ed in any pretended parliament; particularly the attainder of the earl of Cambridge, the King's grandfather; as well as that of the earls of Sali&s;bury and Gloce&s;ter and of lord Lumley, who were forfeited for adhering to Richard II.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p, 672.

<P>MANY of the&s;e votes were the re&s;ult of the u&s;ual violence of party: The com|mon &s;en&s;e of mankind, in more peaceable times, repealed them: And the &s;tatutes of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, being the deeds of an e&s;tabli&s;hed government, and en|acted by princes long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of authority, have always been held as valid and obligatory. The parliament, however, in &s;ubverting &s;uch deep foundations, had &s;till the pretence of replacing the government on its antient and natural ba|&s;is: But in their &s;ub&s;equent mea&s;ures, they were more guided by revenge, or at lea&s;t the views of convenience, than by the maxims of equity and ju&s;tice. They pa&s;&s;ed an act of forfeiture and attainder again&s;t Henry VI. and queen Margaret, and their infant &s;on, prince Edward: The &s;ame act was extended to the dukes of Somer&s;et and Exeter; to the earls of Northumberland, Devon&s;hire, Pembroke, Wilts; to the vi&s;count Beaumont, the lords Roos, Nevil, Clifford, Wells, Dacre, Gray of Rugemont, Hungerford; to Alexander Hedie, Nicholas Latimer, Ed|mond Mountfort, John Heron, and many other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 670. W. Wyr|ce&s;ter, p. 490.</NOTE>. The parliament ve&s;ted the e&s;tates of all the&s;e attainted per&s;ons in the crown; tho' their &s;ole crime was the adhering to a prince, whom every individual of the parlia|ment had &s;o long recognized, and whom that very King him&s;elf, who was now &s;eated on the throne, had acknowledged and obeyed as his lawful &s;overeign.</P>
<P>THE nece&s;&s;ity of &s;upporting the government e&s;tabli&s;hed, will ju&s;tify more ful|ly &s;ome other acts of violence; tho' the method of conducting them may &s;till appear exceptionable.

Sir William Tyrrel, Sir Tho|mas Tudenham, and John Montgomery were convicted in the &s;ame arbitrary court; were executed, and their e&s;tates forfeited. This introduction of martial law into civil government was a high &s;train of prerogative; which, were it not for the violence of the times, would probably have appeared exceptionable to a nation &s;o jealous of their liberties as the Engli&s;h were now become<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">That we may judge how arbitrary a court, that of the con&s;table of England was, we may peru&s;e the patent granted to the earl of Rivers in this reign, as it is to be found in Spellman's Glo&s;&s;ary in verb. <HI>Con&s;tabalarius;</HI> as al&s;o, more fully in Rymer, vol. 11. p. 581.

It involved a full dic|tatorial power, continually &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in the &s;tate. The only check on the crown, be&s;ides the want of force to &s;upport all its prerogatives, was, that the office of con&s;table was commonly either hereditary or during life; and the per&s;on inve&s;ted with it, was, for that rea&s;on, not &s;o proper an in&s;trument of ar|bitrary power in the King. Accordingly, the office was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by Henry VIII. the mo&s;t arbitrary of all the Engli&s;h princes. The practice, however, of exerci&s;ing martial law, &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; and was not aboli&s;hed till the Petition of Right under Charles I. This was the epoch of true liberty, confirmed by the Re&s;toration, and enlarged and &s;ecured by the Revolution.</NOTE>. It was

<P>BUT the new e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;eemed precarious and uncertain, not only from the dome&s;tic di&s;contents of the people, but from the efforts of foreign powers. Lewis, the eleventh of the name, had &s;ucceeded to his father, Charles, in 1460; and was led, from the obvious motives of national intere&s;t, to feed the flames of civil di&s;|cord among &s;uch dangerous neighbours, by giving &s;upport to the weaker party. But the intriguing and politic genius of this prince was here checked by it&s;elf: Having attempted to &s;ubdue the independant &s;pirit of his own va&s;&s;als, he had excited &s;uch an oppo&s;ition at home, as prevented him from making all the ad|vantage, which the opportunity afforded, of the di&s;&s;en&s;ions among the Engli&s;h. <MILESTONE N="1462" UNIT="year"> He &s;ent however a &s;mall body to Henry's a&s;&s;i&s;tance under Varenne, Sene&s;chal of Normandy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, vol. 3. p. 95.</NOTE>, who landed in Northumberland, and got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ca&s;tle of Alnewic; but as the indefatigable Margaret, went in per&s;on to France, where &s;he &s;ollicited larger &s;upplies<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">W.

<P>THE fate of the unfortunate royal family, after this defeat, was very &s;ingular.

This ea&s;y and plea|&s;urable life augmented every day his popularity among all ranks of men: He was the peculiar favourite of the young and gay of both &s;exes: The di&s;po&s;ition of the Engli&s;h, little addicted to jealou&s;y, kept them from taking umbrage at the&s;e liberties: And his indulgence in amu&s;ements, while it gratified his inclination, was thus become, without de&s;ign, a means of &s;upporting and &s;ecuring his govern|ment: But as it is difficult to reduce the ruling pa&s;&s;ion within &s;trict rules of pru|dence, the amorous temper of Edward led him into a &s;nare which proved very fatal to his future repo&s;e, and to the &s;tability of his throne.</P>

fighting on the &s;ide of Lanca&s;ter, and his e&s;tate being for that rea&s;on confi&s;cated, his widow retired to live with her father, at his &s;eat of Grafton in Northampton|&s;hire. The King came accidentally to the hou&s;e, after a hunting party, in order to pay a vi&s;it to the duche&s;s of Bedford; and as the occa&s;ion &s;eemed favourable for obtaining &s;ome grace from this gallante monarch, the young widow flung her&s;elf at his feet, and with many tears, entreated him to take pity on her impoveri&s;hed and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed children.

<P>THE King, de&s;irous to &s;ecure his throne, as well by the pro&s;pect of i&s;&s;ue, as by foreign alliances, had, a little before, determined to make application to &s;ome neighbouring prince&s;s; and he had ca&s;t his eye on Bona of Savoy, &s;i&s;ter to the Queen of France, who, he hoped, would, by his marrying her, en&s;ure him the friend&s;hip of that power, which was alone both able and inclined to give &s;upport and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to his rival. To render the negotiation more &s;ucce&s;sful, the earl of Warwic had been di&s;patched to Paris, where the prince&s;s then re&s;ided; he had demanded Bona in marriage for the King; his propo&s;als had been accepted; the treaty was fully concluded; and nothing remained but the ratification of the terms agreed on, and the bringing over the prince&s;s into England<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 193.

the &s;ecret of Edward's marriage broke out, the haughty earl, deeming him&s;elf affronted, both by being employed in this deceitful negotiation, and by being kept a &s;tranger to the King's intentions, who had owed every thing to his friend&s;hip, immediately returned to England, inflamed with rage and indignation. The in|fluence of pa&s;&s;ion, over &s;o young a man as Edward, might have &s;erved as an ex|cu&s;e for his imprudent conduct, had he deigned to acknowledge his error, or had pleaded his weakne&s;s as an apology: But his faulty &s;hame or pride prevented him from &s;o much as mentioning the affair to Warwic: <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> and that nobleman was allowed to depart the court, full of the &s;ame ill humour and di&s;content, which he brought to it.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="year"> EVERY incident now tended to widen the breach between the King and this powerful &s;ubject.

<P>THE earl of Warwic could not endure the lea&s;t diminution of that credit, which he had long enjoyed, and which he thought, he had merited by &s;uch im|portant &s;ervices.

and which he him&s;elf had contributed &s;till higher to exalt, was well-plea&s;ed to rai&s;e up rivals in credit to the earl of Warwic; and he ju&s;tified by this political view, his extreme partiality to the Queen's kindred. But the other nobility of England, envying the &s;udden growth of the Widevilles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t Croyl. cont. p. 539.</NOTE>, were more inclined to take part with Warwic's di&s;content, to who&s;e grandeur they were already ac|cu&s;tomed, and who had reconciled them to his &s;uperiority by his gracious and popular manners.

<P>BUT the mo&s;t con&s;iderable a&s;&s;ociate, whom Warwic acquired to his party, was George, duke of Clarence, the King's &s;econd brother.

The favourable opportunity of gaining him was e&s;pied by the earl of Warwic, who offered him in marriage his elde&s;t daughter, and co-heir of his immen&s;e fortunes; a &s;ettlement, which, as it was &s;uperior to any that the King him&s;elf could confer upon him, immediately attached him to the earl's party<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">W.

Thus an exten&s;ive and dangerous combination was in&s;en&s;ibly formed again&s;t Edward and his mini|&s;try: Tho' the object of the malecontents was not at pre&s;ent to overturn the throne, it was difficult to fore&s;ee the extremities, to which they might be carried; and as oppo&s;ition to an admini&s;tration was always in tho&s;e ages pro&s;ecuted by force of arms, civil convul&s;ions and di&s;orders were likely to be &s;oon the re&s;ult of the&s;e intrigues and confederacies.</P>

The oppo&s;ition of intere&s;ts, and &s;till more, a natural antipathy of character, produced a declared animo&s;ity be|tween the&s;e two bad princes; and Edward was thus &s;ecure of the &s;incere attach|ment of either of them, for whom he &s;hould choo&s;e to declare him&s;elf.

The alliance of Bur|gundy was more popular with the Engli&s;h, than that of France; the commer|cial intere&s;ts of the two nations invited the princes to a clo&s;e union; their com|mon jealou&s;y of Lewis was a natural cement between them; <MILESTONE N="1468" UNIT="year"> and Edward, plea&s;|ed with &s;trengthening him&s;elf by &s;o potent a confederate, &s;oon concluded the al|liance, and be&s;towed his &s;i&s;ter upon Charles<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 169, 197.</NOTE>.

But that all the &s;tory is fal&s;e appears from Rymer, where we find, that the King, throughout all this period, continually exerci&s;ed his authority, and never was interrupted in his government. On the 7th of March 1470, he gives a commi&s;&s;ion of array to Clarence, whom he then imagined a good &s;ubject; and on the 23d of the &s;ame month, we find him i&s;&s;uing an order for appre|hending him. Be&s;ides, in the King's manife&s;to again&s;t the duke and earl (Clau&s;. 10 Edw.

The chief certainty in this and the preceding reign ari&s;es either from public records, or from the notice taken of certain pa&s;&s;ages by the French hi&s;torians. On the contrary, for &s;ome centuries after the Conque&s;t, the French hi&s;tory is not compleat without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Engli&s;h authors.</NOTE>; and it is remarkable, that this profound darkne&s;s falls upon us ju&s;t on

All we can di&s;tingui&s;h with certainty thro' the deep cloud, which covers that period, is a &s;cene of horror and blood&s;hed, &s;avage manners, arbitrary executions, and treacherous di&s;honourable conduct in all parties. There is no po&s;&s;ibility, for in&s;tance, of accounting for the views and intentions of the earl of Warwic at this time. It is agreed, that he re&s;ided, with his &s;on in law, the duke of Clarence, in his government of Calais during the commencement of this rebellion; and that his brother, Montague, acted with vigour again&s;t the northern rebels. We may thence pre&s;ume, that the in&s;urrection had not pro|ceeded from the &s;ecret councils and in&s;tigation of Warwic; tho' the murder, com|mitted by the rebels, on the earl of Rivers, his capital enemy, forms, on the other hand, a violent pre&s;umption again&s;t him. He and Clarence came over to Eng|land, offered their &s;ervice to Edward, were received without any &s;u&s;picion, were entru&s;ted by him in the highe&s;t commands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 11. p. 647, 649, 650.</NOTE>, and &s;till per&s;evered in their fideli|ty. Soon after, we find the rebels quieted and di&s;per&s;ed by a general pardon granted by Edward from the advice of the earl of Warwic: But why &s;o coura|geous a prince, if &s;ecure of Warwic's fidelity, &s;hould have granted a general par|don to men, who had been guilty of &s;uch violent and per&s;onal outrages again&s;t him, is not intelligible; nor why that nobleman, if unfaithful, &s;hould have en|deavoured to appea&s;e a rebellion, of which he was able to make &s;uch advantages. But it appears, that, after this in&s;urrection, there was an interval of peace, dur|ing which the King loaded the family of Nevil with honours and favours of the highe&s;t nature: He made the lord Montague a marque&s;s, by the &s;ame name: He created his &s;on, George, duke of Bedford<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 702.</NOTE>: He declared publicly his inten|tion

<P>THE King of France, unea&s;y at the clo&s;e conjunction between Edward and the duke of Burgundy, received with the greate&s;t demon&s;trations of regard and friend&s;hip the unfortunate Warwic<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Polyd.

No animo&s;ity was ever greater than that which had long prevailed between that hou&s;e and the earl of Warwic. His father had been executed by orders from Margaret: He him&s;elf had twice reduced Henry to captivity, had bani&s;hed the queen, had put to death all their mo&s;t zealous partizans either in the field or on the &s;caffold, and had occa&s;ioned innumerable ills to that unhappy family. For this rea&s;on, believing that &s;uch inveterate rancour would never admit of any cor|dial reconciliation, he had not mentioned Henry's name, when he took arms a|gain&s;t Edward; and he rather endeavoured to prevail by means of his own ad|herents, than revive a party, which he &s;incerely hated. But his pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;es and the entreaties of Lewis, made him hearken to terms of accommo|dation; and Margaret being &s;ent for from Angers, where &s;he then re&s;ided, an agreement was from common intere&s;t &s;oon formed between them. It was &s;tipu|lated, that Warwic &s;hould adopt the cau&s;e of Henry, and endeavour to re&s;tore him to liberty and to re-e&s;tabli&s;h him on the throne; that the admini&s;tration of the government, during the minority of young Edward, Henry's &s;on, &s;hould re|&s;ide

conjointly in the earl of Warwic and duke of Clarence; that prince Ed|ward &s;hould marry the lady Anne, &s;econd daughter of that nobleman; and that the crown, in ca&s;e of the failure of male-i&s;&s;ue in that prince, &s;hould de&s;cend to the duke of Clarence, to the entire exclu&s;ion of King Edward and his po&s;terity. Never was confederacy on all &s;ides, le&s;s natural or more evidently the work of nece&s;&s;ity: But Warwic hoped, that all former pa&s;&s;ions of the Lanca&s;trians might be lo&s;t in pre&s;ent political views; and that at wor&s;t, the independant power of his family, and the affections of the people, would be able to give him &s;ecurity, and enable him to exact the full performance of all the conditions agreed on. The marriage of prince Edward with the lady Anne was immediately celebrated in France.</P>
<P>EDWARD rea&s;onably fore&s;aw, that it would be ea&s;y to di&s;&s;olve an alliance, com|po&s;ed of &s;uch di&s;cordant parts. For this purpo&s;e, he &s;ent over a lady of great &s;agacity and addre&s;s, who belonged to the train of the dutche&s;s of Clarence, and who, under colour of attending her mi&s;tre&s;s, was empowered to negotiate with the duke, and renew the connexions of that prince with his own family<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 5. Hall, fol. 207. Holing&s;hed, p. 675.</NOTE>. She repre&s;ented to Clarence, that he had unwarily, to his own ruin, become the in&s;tru|ment of Warwic's vengeance, and had thrown him&s;elf entirely in the power of his mo&s;t inveterate enemies; that the mortal injuries, which the one royal family had &s;uffered from the other, were now pa&s;t all forgivene&s;s, and no idea of an imaginary union in intere&s;ts could ever &s;uffice to obliterate them; that even if the leaders were willing to forget pa&s;t offences, the animo&s;ity of their adherents would prevent a &s;incere coalition of parties, and would, in &s;pite
of all temporary and verbal agreements, pre&s;erve an eternal oppo&s;ition of mea&s;ures between them; and that a prince, who de&s;erted his own kindred, and joined the murderers of his father, left him&s;elf &s;ingle, without friends, without protection, and would not, when misfortunes inevitably fell upon him, be &s;o much as entitled to any pity or regard from the re&s;t of mankind. Clarence was only one and twenty years of age, and &s;eems to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed but a &s;lender capacity; yet he could ea&s;ily &s;ee the force of the&s;e rea&s;ons; and on the promi&s;e of forgivene&s;s and favour from his brother, he &s;ecretly engaged, on a favourable opportunity, to de&s;ert the earl of Warwic, and abandon the Lanca&s;trian party.</P>
<P>DURING this negotiation, Warwic was &s;ecretly carrying on a corre&s;pondence of the &s;ame nature with his brother, the marque&s;s of Montague, who was entire|ly tru&s;ted by Edward; and like motives produced a like re&s;olution in that noble|man.

<P>AFTER the&s;e mutual &s;nares were thus carefully laid, the deci&s;ion of the quar|rel advanced apace.

The duke of Burgundy, on the other hand, enraged at that nobleman for his &s;eizure of the Flemi&s;h &s;hips before Calais; and anxious to &s;upport the reigning family in England, with whom his own in|tere&s;ts were now collected, fitted out a larger fleet, with which he guarded the Channel; and he ince&s;&s;antly warned his brother in law of the imminent perils, to which he was expo&s;ed.

The &s;cene, which en&s;ues, &s;eems more like the fiction of a poem or romance than an event in true hi&s;tory. The prodigious popularity of Warwic<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 205.</NOTE>, the zeal of the Lan|ca&s;trian party, the &s;pirit of di&s;content with which many were infected, and the general in&s;tability of the Engli&s;h nation, occa&s;ioned by the late frequent revolu|tions, drew &s;uch multitudes to his &s;tandard, that in a very few days his army amounted to &s;ixty thou&s;and men, and was continually encrea&s;ing.

He had ju&s;t time to get on hor&s;eback, and to hurry with a &s;mall retinue to Lynne, in Norfolk, where he luckily found &s;ome &s;hips ready, on board which he pre&s;ently embarked<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 5.

<P>BUT Edward's danger did not end with his embarkation. The Ea&s;terlings or Han&s;e-Towns were then at war both with France and England; and &s;ome &s;hips of the&s;e people, hovering on the Engli&s;h coa&s;t, e&s;pied the King's ve&s;&s;els, and gave chace to them; nor was it without extreme difficulty, that he made his e&s;cape into the port of Alcmaer in Holland. He had fled from England with &s;uch precipitation, that he had carried nothing of value along with him; and the only reward, which he could be&s;tow on the captain of the ve&s;&s;el, that brought him over, was a robe, lined with &s;ables; promi&s;ing him an ample recompence, if fortune &s;hould ever become more propitious to him<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is not likely, that Edward could be very fond of pre&s;enting him&s;elf in this lamentable condition before the duke of Burgundy; and that having &s;o &s;udden|ly, after his mighty vaunts, lo&s;t all footing in his own kingdom, he could be in|&s;en&s;ible to the ridicule, which mu&s;t attend him in the eyes of that prince. The duke, on his part, was no le&s;s embarra&s;&s;ed how he &s;hould receive the dethroned monarch. As he had ever borne a greater affection to the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter than to that of York, nothing but political views had engaged him to contract an alliance with the latter family; and he fore&s;aw, that probably the revolution in England would now turn this alliance again&s;t him, and render the reigning family in that kingdom his implacable and jealous enemy. For this rea&s;on, when the fir&s;t rumor of that event reached him, attended with the circum&s;tance of Edward's death, he &s;eemed rather plea&s;ed with the cata&s;trophe; and it was no agreeable di&s;appointment to find, that he mu&s;t either undergo the burthen of &s;upporting an exiled prince, or the di&s;honour of abandoning &s;o near a relation<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 5.

The treaty with Margaret was here fully executed: Henry was recognized for lawful King; but his incapacity for government being avowed, the regency was entru&s;ted to Warwic and Clarence till the majority of prince Edward; and in de|fault of that prince's i&s;&s;ue, Clarence was declared &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the crown. The u&s;ual bu&s;ine&s;s al&s;o of rever&s;als went on without oppo&s;ition: Every &s;tatute, made, during the reign of Edward, was repealed; that prince was declared to be an u&s;urper; he and his adherents were attainted; and in particular, Richard, duke of Gloce&s;ter, his younger brother: All the attainders of the Lanca&s;trians, the dukes of Somer&s;et and Exeter, the earls of Richmond, Pembroke, Oxford and Ormond, were rever&s;ed; and every one was re&s;tored, who had lo&s;t either ho|nours or fortune, by his former adherence to the cau&s;e of Henry.</P>
<P>THE ruling party were more &s;paring in their executions, than was u&s;ual after any revolution during tho&s;e violent times.

However this may be, Edward's entrance into London, made him ma&s;ter not only of that rich and powerful city, but al&s;o of the per&s;on of Henry, who, de&s;tined to be the perpetual &s;port of fortune, thus fell again into the hands of his enemies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 702.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT appears not, that Warwic, during his &s;hort admini&s;tration, which had con|tinued only &s;ix months, had been guilty of any unpopular acts, or had any wi&s;e de&s;erved to forfeit that general favour, with which he had &s;o lately overwhelmed Edward. But this prince, who was formerly the defendant, was now the ag|gre&s;&s;or; and having overcome the difficulties, which always attend the beginnings of an in&s;urrection, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many advantages above his enemy: His partizans were actuated by that zeal and courage, which the notion of an attack in&s;pires; his opponents were intimidated for a like rea&s;on; every one, who had been di&s;|appointed in the hopes, which he had entertained from Warwic's elevation, either became a cool friend, or an open enemy to that nobleman; and each malecontent, from whatever cau&s;e, proved an acce&s;&s;ion to Edward's army. The King, there|fore, found him&s;elf in a condition to face the earl of Warwic, who, being re|inforced by his &s;on in-law, the duke of Clarence, and his brother the marquis of Montague, took po&s;t at Barnet, in the neighbourhood of London. The ar|rival of Queen Margaret was every day expected, who would have drawn toge|ther all the true Lanca&s;trians, and have brought a mighty acce&s;&s;ion to Warwic's forces: But this very con&s;ideration proved a motive to the earl rather to hurry on a deci&s;ive action, than to &s;hare the victory with rivals and antient enemies, who, he fore&s;aw, would, in ca&s;e of &s;ucce&s;s, claim the chief merit in the enterprize<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3 chap. 7.</NOTE>.

LEWIS's de&s;ire of confirming a mutual amity with England, engaged him even to make imprudent advances, which co&s;t him afterwards &s;ome pains to evade. In the conference at Pecquigni, he had &s;aid to Edward, that he wi&s;hed to have a vi&s;it from him at Paris; that he would there endeavour to amu&s;e him with the ladies; and that, in ca&s;e any offences were then committed, he would a&s;&s;ign him the car|dinal of Bourbon for confe&s;&s;or, who, from fellow-feeling, would not be over and above &s;evere in the penances, which he would injoin.

<P>THIS treaty did very little honour to either of the&s;e monarchs: It di&s;covered the imprudence of Edward, who had taken his mea&s;ures &s;o ill with his allies, as to be obliged, after &s;uch expen&s;ive preparations, to return without making any ac|qui&s;itions, equivalent to them: It &s;howed the want of dignity in Lewis, who, rather than run the hazard of a battle, agreed to &s;ubject his kingdom to a tribute, and thus acknowledge the &s;uperiority of a neighbouring prince, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of much le&s;s power and territory than him&s;elf. But as Lewis made intere&s;t the &s;ole te&s;t of honour, he thought, that all the advantages of the treaty were on his &s;ide, and that he had over-reached Edward by &s;ending him out of France on &s;uch ea&s;y terms.

&s;on, &s;he could no longer be formidable to the government, was &s;till detained in cu&s;tody by Edward. Lewis paid fifty thou&s;and crowns for her ran&s;on; and that prince&s;s, who had been &s;o active in the &s;tage of the world, and who had expe|rienced &s;uch a variety of fortune, pa&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of her days in tranquillity and privacy, till the year 1482, when &s;he died: An admirable prince&s;s, but more il|lu&s;trious by her undaunted &s;pirit in adver&s;ity, than by her moderation in pro&s;pe|rity. She &s;eems neither to have enjoyed the virtues, nor been &s;ubject to the weakne&s;&s;es of her &s;ex; and was as much tainted with the ferocity, as endowed with the courage, of that barbarous age, in which &s;he lived.</P>
<P>THO' Edward had &s;o little rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with the conduct of the duke of Burgundy, he re&s;erved to that prince a power of acceding to the treaty of Amiens: But Charles, when the offer was made him, haughtily replied, that he was able to &s;upport him&s;elf without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of England, and that he would make no peace with Lewis, till three months after Edward's return into his own country. This prince po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the ambition and courage of a conqueror; but being defective in policy and prudence, qualities no le&s;s e&s;&s;ential, he was un|fortunate in all his enterprizes; and peri&s;hed at la&s;t in battle again&s;t the Swi&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 5. chap. 8.</NOTE>; a people, whom he de&s;pi&s;ed, and who, tho' brave and free, had hitherto been in a manner overlooked in the general &s;y&s;tem of Europe. <MILESTONE N="1477" UNIT="year"> This event, which hap|pened in the year 1477, produced a great alteration in the views of all the prin|ces, and was attended with con&s;equences which were felt for many generations. Charles left only one daughter, Mary, by his fir&s;t wife; and this prince&s;s being heir of his opulent and exten&s;ive dominions, was courted by all the potentates of Chri&s;tendom, who contended with each other for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o rich a prize. Lewis, the head of her family, might, by a proper application, have obtained this match for the Dauphin, and have thereby united to the crown of France all the provinces of the Low Countries, together with Burgundy, Artois, and Pic|cardy; which would at once have rendered his kingdom an overmatch for all his neighbours. But a man wholly intere&s;ted is as rare as one entirely endowed with the oppo&s;ite virtue; and Lewis, tho' impregnable to all the &s;entiments of genero&s;ity and friend&s;hip, was, on this occa&s;ion, carried from the road of true po|licy by the pa&s;&s;ions of animo&s;ity and revenge. He had imbibed &s;o deep a ha|tred of the hou&s;e of Burgundy, that he cho&s;e rather to &s;ubdue the prince&s;s by force of arms, than unite her to his family by marriage: He conquered the dut|chy of Burgundy and that part of Picardy, which had been ceded to Philip the Good by the treaty of Arras: But he forced the &s;tates of the Netherlands to be|&s;tow their &s;overeign in marriage on Maximilian of Au&s;tria, &s;on to the emperor,

Frederic, from whom they looked for protection in their pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;es: And by the&s;e means, France lo&s;t the opportunity, which &s;he never could recover, of making that important acqui&s;ition of power and territory.</P>
<P>DURING this intere&s;ting cri&s;is, Edward was no le&s;s defective in policy, and was no le&s;s actuated by private pa&s;&s;ions, unworthy of a &s;overeign and a &s;tate&s;|man. Jealou&s;y of his brother, Clarence, had cau&s;ed him to neglect the advan|ces which were made of marrying that prince, now a widower, to the heire&s;s of Burgundy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polyd. Virg. Hall, fol. 240. Holing&s;hed, p. 703. Habington, p. 474. Grafton, p. 742.</NOTE>; and he &s;ent her propo&s;als of e&s;pou&s;ing Anthony earl of Rivers, bro|ther to his queen, who &s;till retained an entire a&s;cendant over him. But the match was rejected with di&s;dain<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 240.</NOTE>; and Edward re&s;enting this treatment of his brother in law, permitted Lewis to proceed without interruption in his conque&s;ts over that defencele&s;s ally. Any pretence &s;ufficed him for giving him&s;elf up entirely to indolence and plea&s;ure, which were now become his ruling pa&s;&s;ions. The on|ly object, which divided his attention, was the improving the revenues of the crown, which had been extremely dilapidated by the nece&s;&s;ities or negligence of his predece&s;&s;ors; and &s;ome of his expedients for that purpo&s;e, tho' unknown to us, were deemed, during the time, oppre&s;&s;ive to the people<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 241. Hi&s;t. Croyl. cont. p. 559.</NOTE>. The detail of private wrongs naturally e&s;capes the notice of hi&s;tory; but an act of tyranny, of which Edward was guilty in his own family, has been taken notice of by all hi&s;|torians, and has met with very general and de&s;erved cen&s;ure.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial and ex|ecution of the duke of Cla|rence.</NOTE> THE duke of Clarence, by all his &s;ervices in de&s;erting Warwic, had never been able to recover the King's friend&s;hip, which he had forfeited by his former con|federacy with that nobleman. He was &s;till regarded at court as a man of a dan|gerous and a fickle character; and the imprudent openne&s;s and violence of his tem|per, tho' it rendered him much le&s;s dangerous, tended extremely to multiply his enemies, and to enrage them again&s;t him. Among the&s;e, he had had the misfortune to give di&s;plea&s;ure to the queen her&s;elf, as well as to his brother, the duke of Gloce&s;ter, a prince of the deepe&s;t policy, of the mo&s;t unrelenting ambi|tion, and the lea&s;t &s;crupulous in the means which he employed for the attain|ment of his pernicious purpo&s;es. A combination between the&s;e potent adver&s;a|ries being &s;ecretly formed again&s;t Clarence, it was determined to begin with at|tacking his friends; in hopes, that, if he patiently &s;uffered this injury, his pu|&s;illanimity would di&s;honour him in the eyes of the public; if he made re&s;i&s;tance and expre&s;&s;ed re&s;entment, his pa&s;&s;ion would betray him into mea&s;ures, which might give them advantages again&s;t him. The King, hunting one day in the park of Thomas Burdet of Arrow, in Warwick&s;hire, had killed a white buck,
<PB N="416" REF="424">
which was a great favourite of the owner; and Burdet, vext at the lo&s;s, broke into a pa&s;&s;ion, and wi&s;hed the horns of the deer in the belly of the per&s;on who had advi&s;ed the King to commit that in&s;ult upon him. This natural expre&s;&s;ion of re&s;entment, which would have been overlooked or forgotten, had it come from any other per&s;on, was rendered criminal and capital in that gentleman, by the friend&s;hip in which he had the misfortune to live with the duke of Clarence: He was tried for his life; the judges and jury were found &s;ervile enough to con|demn him; and he was publickly beheaded at Tyburn for this pretended of|&s;ence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Habington, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">.

<P>THE duke of Clarence was alarmed, when he found the&s;e acts of tyranny ex|erci&s;ed on all around him: He reflected on the fate of the good duke of Gloce|&s;ter in the la&s;t reign, who, after &s;eeing the mo&s;t infamous pretences employed for the de&s;truction of his neare&s;t connections, at la&s;t fell him&s;elf a victim to the ven|geance of his enemies. <MILESTONE N="1478" UNIT="year"> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">th Jan.</NOTE> But Clarence, in&s;tead of &s;ecuring his own life again&s;t the pre&s;ent danger, by &s;ilence and re&s;erve, was open and loud in ju&s;tifying the inno|cence of his friends, and in exclaiming again&s;t the iniquity of their per&s;ecutors. The King, highly offended with his liberty, or u&s;ing that pretence again&s;t him, committed him to the Tower<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t.

The&s;e maxims, &s;o ungener|ous, &s;o oppo&s;ite to all the principles of good government, &s;o contrary to the practice of pre&s;ent parliaments, are very remarkable in all the tran&s;actions of the Eng|li&s;h hi&s;tory for more than a century after the period, in which we are now engaged.</P>
<P>THE only favour, which the King granted his brother after his condemnation, was to leave him the choice of his death; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">th Feb</NOTE> and he was privately drowned in a But of Malme&s;ey in the Tower: A whim&s;ical choice, which implies that he had an extraordinary pa&s;&s;ion for that liquor.

Lewis, who paid no regard to treaties or engagements, found his ad|vantage in contracting the Dauphin to the prince&s;s Margaret, the daughter of Maximilian; and the King, notwith&s;tanding his indolence, prepared him&s;elf to revenge this indignity. <MILESTONE N="1482" UNIT="year"> The French monarch, eminent for prudence, as well as fal&s;ehood, endeavoured to guard again&s;t the blow; and by a proper di&s;tribution of pre&s;ents in the court of Scotland, he excited James to make war upon Eng|land.

<P><MILESTONE N="1483" UNIT="year"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">State of the court.</NOTE> DURING the latter years of Edward IV. the nation, having, in a great mea&s;ure, forgot the bloody feuds between the two Ro&s;es, and acquie&s;cing peaceably in the e&s;tabli&s;hed government, was only agitated by &s;ome court|intrigues, which, being re&s;trained by the authority of the King, &s;eemed no wi&s;e to endanger the public tranquillity. The&s;e intrigues aro&s;e from the perpetual rival&s;hip between two parties; the one con&s;i&s;ting of the Queen and her relations, particularly the earl of Rivers, her brother, and the marqui&s;s of Dor&s;et, her &s;on; the other compo&s;ed of the antient nobility, who envied the &s;udden growth and unlimited credit of that a&s;piring family<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir T. More, p. 481.</NOTE>. At the head of this latter party was the duke of Buckingham, a man of very noble birth, of ample po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, of great alliances, of &s;hining parts; who, tho' he had married the Queen's &s;i&s;ter, was too haughty to act in &s;ub&s;erviency to her inclinations, and aimed rather at maintaining an independant influence and authority. Lord Ha&s;tings, the cham|berlain, was another leader of the &s;ame party; and as this nobleman had, by his bravery and enterprize, as well as by his approved fidelity, acquired the confi|dence and favour of his ma&s;ter, he had been able, tho' with &s;ome difficulty, to &s;upport him&s;elf again&s;t the credit of the Queen. The lords Howard and Stanley maintained a connexion with the&s;e two noblemen, and brought a con&s;iderable ac|ce&s;&s;ion of influence and credit to their party. All the other barons, who had no
<PB N="420" REF="428">
particular dependance on the Queen, adhered to the &s;ame intere&s;t; and the peo|ple in general, from their natural envy again&s;t the prevailing power, bore great favour to the cau&s;e of the&s;e noblemen.</P>
<P>BUT Edward knew, that, tho' he him&s;elf had been able to overawe tho&s;e rival factions, many di&s;orders might re&s;ult from their conte&s;ts during the minority of his &s;on; and he therefore took care, in his la&s;t illne&s;s, to &s;ummon together &s;everal of the leaders on both &s;ides, and, by compo&s;ing their antient quarrels, to pro|vide, as far as po&s;&s;ible, for the future tranquillity of the government. After ex|pre&s;&s;ing his intentions, that his brother, the duke of Gloce&s;ter, then ab&s;ent in the north, &s;hould be entru&s;ted with the regency, he recommended to them peace and unanimity during the tender years of his &s;on; repre&s;ented to them the dangers which mu&s;t attend the continuance of their animo&s;ities; and engaged them to embrace each other with all the &s;ymptoms of the mo&s;t cordial reconcili|ation. But this temporary or feigned agreement la&s;ted no longer than the King's life: He had no &s;ooner expired, than the jealou&s;ies of the parties broke out afre&s;h: And each of them applied, by &s;eparate me&s;&s;ages, to the duke of Gloce&s;|ter, and endeavoured to acquire his favour and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>THIS prince, during his brother's lifetime, had endeavoured to live on good terms with both parties; and his high birth, his exten&s;ive abilities, and his great &s;ervices, had enabled him to &s;upport him&s;elf without falling into a dependance on either. But the new &s;ituation of affairs, when the &s;upreme power was devol|ved upon him, immediately changed all his mea&s;ures; and he &s;ecretly deter|mined to pre&s;erve no longer that neutrality which he had hitherto maintained. His exorbitant ambition, unre&s;trained by any principle either of ju&s;tice or humanity, made him carry his views to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown it&s;elf; and as this object could not be attained without the ruin of the Queen and her family, he fell, without he&s;itation, into concert with the oppo&s;ite party. But being &s;en&s;ible, that the mo&s;t profound di&s;&s;imulation was requi&s;ite to the effecting his criminal purpo&s;es, he redoubled his profe&s;&s;ions of zeal and attachment to that prince&s;s; and he gained &s;uch credit with her, as to influence her conduct in a point, which, as it was of the utmo&s;t importance, was violently di&s;puted between the oppo&s;ite factions.</P>
<P>THE King, at the time of his father's death, re&s;ided in the ca&s;tle of Ludlow, on the borders of Wales; whither he had been &s;ent, that the influence of his pre|&s;ence might overawe the Wel&s;h, and re&s;tore the tranquillity of that country, which had been di&s;turbed by &s;ome late commotions.

<P>THE people, however, were extremely rejoiced at this revolution; <NOTE PLACE="marg">4th of May.</NOTE> and the duke was received in London with the loude&s;t acclamations: But the Queen no &s;ooner received intelligence of her brother's impri&s;onment, than &s;he fore&s;aw, that Gloce&s;ter's violence would not &s;top there, and that her own ruin, if not that of all her children, was finally determined. She therefore fled into the &s;anctuary of We&s;tmin&s;ter, attended by the marqui&s;s of Dor&s;et; and &s;he carried thither the five prince&s;&s;es, together with the duke of York<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t.

She tru&s;ted, that the eccle&s;i|a&s;tical privileges, which had formerly, during the total ruin of her hu&s;band and family, given her protection again&s;t the fury of the Lanca&s;trian faction, would not now be violated by her brother-in-law, while her &s;on was &s;eated on the throne; and &s;he re&s;olved to await there the return of better fortune. But Glo|ce&s;ter, anxious to have the duke of York in his power, propo&s;ed to take him by force from the &s;anctuary; and he repre&s;ented to the privy council, both the in|dignity put upon the government by the Queen's ill-grounded apprehen&s;ions, and the nece&s;&s;ity of the young prince's appearance at the en&s;uing coronation of his brother. It was farther alledged, that eccle&s;ia&s;tical privileges were originally calculated only to give protection to unhappy men, per&s;ecuted for their debts or crimes; and were entirely u&s;ele&s;s to a per&s;on, who, by rea&s;on of his tender age, could lie under the burden of neither, and who, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, was utterly incapable of claiming &s;ecurity from any &s;anctuary. But the two archbi&s;hops, cardinal Bourchier, the primate, and Rotheram archbi&s;hop of York, prote&s;ting again&s;t the &s;acrilege of this mea&s;ure; it was agreed, that they &s;hould fir&s;t endea|vour to bring the Queen to compliance by per&s;ua&s;ion, before any violence &s;hould be employed again&s;t her.

Croyl. cont. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">.</NOTE>. The general pre|judice entertained by the nobility again&s;t the Queen and her kindred, occa&s;ioned this precipitation and irregularity; and no one fore&s;aw any danger to the &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion, much le&s;s to the life of the infant princes, from a mea&s;ure &s;o obvious and &s;o natural. Be&s;ides that the duke had hitherto been able to cover, by the mo&s;t profound di&s;&s;imulation, his fierce and &s;avage nature; the numerous i&s;&s;ue of Ed|ward, together with the two children of Clarence, &s;eemed to be an eternal ob|&s;tacle to his ambition; and it appeared equally impracticable for him to di&s;patch &s;o many per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a preferable title, and imprudent to exclude them. But a man, who had abandoned all principles of honour and humanity, was &s;oon carried by his predominant pa&s;&s;ion beyond the reach of fear or precaution; and Gloce&s;ter, having &s;o far &s;ucceeded in his views, no longer he&s;itated in removing the farther ob&s;tructions which lay between him and the crown. The death of the earl of Rivers, and of the other pri&s;oners detained in Pomfret, was fir&s;t deter|mined; and he ea&s;ily obtained the con&s;ent of the duke of Buckingham, as well as of lord Ha&s;tings, to this violent and &s;anguinary mea&s;ure. However ea&s;y it was, in tho&s;e illegal and barbarous times, to obtain a &s;entence again&s;t the mo&s;t innocent per&s;on, it appeared &s;till more ea&s;y to di&s;patch an enemy, without any trial or form of proce&s;s; and orders were accordingly i&s;&s;ued to Sir Richard Rat|cliffe, a proper in&s;trument in the hands of this tyrant, to cut off the heads of the noble pri&s;oners. The protector then a&s;&s;ailed the fidelity of Buckingham by all the arguments capable of &s;waying a vicious mind, which knew no motive of ac|tion but intere&s;t and ambition. He repre&s;ented, that the murder of per&s;ons &s;o nearly related to the King, whom that prince profe&s;&s;ed &s;o openly to love, and who&s;e injuries he &s;o much re&s;ented, would never pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed; and all the actors in that &s;cene were bound in prudence to prevent the effects of his future vengeance: That it would be impo&s;&s;ible to keep the Queen for ever at a di&s;tance from her &s;on, and equally impo&s;&s;ible to prevent her from in&s;tilling into his tender

mind the thoughts of retaliating, by like executions, the &s;anguinary in&s;ults com|mitted on her family: That the only method of obviating the&s;e mi&s;chiefs was by putting the &s;ceptre into the hands of a man, of who&s;e friend&s;hip the duke might be a&s;&s;ured, and who&s;e years and experience taught him to pay re&s;pect to merit and to the rights of antient nobility: And that the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity which had carried them &s;o far in re&s;i&s;ting the u&s;urpation of the&s;e intruders, mu&s;t ju&s;tify them in at|tempting farther innovations, and in making, by national con&s;ent, a new &s;ettle|ment of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. To the&s;e rea&s;ons, he added the offers of great private advantages to the duke of Buckingham, and he ea&s;ily obtained from him a pro|mi&s;e of &s;upporting him in all his enterprizes.</P>
<P>THE duke of Gloce&s;ter, knowing the importance of gaining lord Ha&s;tings, founded at a di&s;tance his &s;entiments, by the means of one Cate&s;by, a lawyer, who was a great confident of that nobleman; but found him impregnable in his al|legiance and fidelity to the children of Edward, who had ever honoured him with his friend&s;hip<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir T.

He &s;aw, therefore, that there was no longer any mea&s;ures to be kept with him; and he determined to ruin utterly the man, whom he de&s;paired of engaging to concur in his u&s;urpation. <NOTE PLACE="marg">13th of June.</NOTE> On the very day when Rivers, Gray, and Vaughan, were executed, or rather murdered, at Pomfret, by Ha&s;tings's advice, the protector &s;ummoned a council in the Tower; whither that nobleman, &s;u&s;pecting no de&s;ign again&s;t him, repaired without he&s;itation. The duke of Glo|ce&s;ter was capable of committing the mo&s;t bloody and treacherous murders with the utmo&s;t coolne&s;s and indifference. On taking his place at the council-board, he appeared in the ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t jovial humour in the world. He &s;eemed to indulge him&s;elf in familiar conver&s;ation with the coun&s;ellors, before they &s;hould enter upon bu&s;ine&s;s; and having paid &s;ome compliments to Morton, bi&s;hop of Ely, on the good and early &s;trawberries which he rai&s;ed in his garden at Hol|born, he begged the favour of having a di&s;h of them, which that prelate imme|diately di&s;patched a &s;ervant to bring him. The protector then left the council, as if called away by &s;ome other bu&s;ine&s;s; but &s;oon after returning with an angry and enflamed countenance, he a&s;ked them, what puni&s;hment tho&s;e de&s;erved that had plotted again&s;t <HI>his</HI> life, who was &s;o nearly related to the King, and was en|tru&s;ted with the admini&s;tration of the government? Ha&s;tings replied, that they merited the puni&s;hment of traitors. <HI>The&s;e traitors,</HI> cried the protector, <HI>are the &s;orcere&s;s, my brother's wife, and Jane Shore, his mi&s;tre&s;s, with others, their a&s;&s;o|ciates: See to what a condition they have reduced me by their incantations and witch|craft:</HI> Upon which he laid bare his arm, all &s;hrivelled and decayed.

<P>LORD Stanley, the archbi&s;hop of York, the bi&s;hop of Ely, and other coun&s;el|lors, were committed pri&s;oners to different chambers of the Tower: And the protector, in order to carry on the farce of his accu&s;ations, ordered the goods of Jane Shore to be &s;eized; and he &s;ummoned her to an&s;wer before the council for &s;or|cery and inchantment. But as no proofs, which could be received even in that ignorant age, were produced again&s;t her, he ordered her to be tried in the &s;piritu|al court, for her adulteries and lewdne&s;s; and &s;he did penance in a white &s;heet at St. Paul's before the whole people. This lady was born of reputable parents in London, was well educated, and married to a &s;ub&s;tantial citizen; but unhap|pily, views of intere&s;t, more than the maid's inclinations, had been con&s;ulted in this match, and her mind, tho' framed for virtue, had proved unable to re&s;i&s;t the

allurements of Edward, who &s;ollicited her favours. But while &s;educed from her duty by this gay and amorous monarch, &s;he &s;till made her&s;elf re&s;pectable by her other virtues; and the a&s;cendant, which her charms and vivacity long maintained over him, was all employed in acts of beneficence and humanity. She was &s;till forward to oppo&s;e calumny, to protect the oppre&s;&s;ed, to relieve the indigent; and her good offices, the genuine re&s;ult of her heart, never waited the &s;olicitation of pretents, or the hopes of reciprocal favours. But &s;he lived not only to feel the butterne&s;s of &s;hame impo&s;ed on her by this barbarous tyrant, but to experience in old age and poverty, the ingratitude of tho&s;e courtiers, who had long &s;olicited her friend&s;hip, and been protected by her credit. No one, among the great multi|tudes whom &s;he had obliged, appeared to bring her con&s;olation or relief: She langui&s;hed out her life in &s;olitude and indigence: And amid&s;t a court, enured to the mo&s;t atrocious crimes, the frailties of this woman ju&s;tified all violations of friend&s;hip towards her, and all oblivion of former favours.</P>

The licentious life of Edward, who was not re&s;trained in his plea&s;ures by any principle either of honour or prudence, afforded a pretence for declaring his marriage with the Queen invalid, and all his po&s;terity illegiti|mate.

But as it would be difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to prove the preceding marriage of the late King; and as the principle which excluded the heirs of an attainted blood, from private &s;ucce&s;&s;ions was never ex|tended to the crown; the Protector re&s;olved to make u&s;e of another plea &s;till more &s;hameful and &s;candalous. His partizans were taught to maintain, that both Edward IV. and the duke of Clarence, were illegitimate; that the dutche&s;s of York had received different lovers into her bed, who were the fathers of the&s;e children; that their re&s;emblance to tho&s;e gallants was a &s;ufficient proof of their &s;purious birth; and that the duke of Gloce&s;ter alone, of all her &s;ons, appeared,
<PB N="427" REF="435">
by his features and countenance, to be the lawful offspring of the duke of York. Nothing can be imagined more impudent than this a&s;&s;ertion, which threw &s;o foul an imputation on his own mother, a prince&s;s of irreproachable virtue, and then alive; yet the place cho&s;en for fir&s;t promulgating it was the pulpit, before the whole people, and in the Protector's pre&s;ence. Dr. Shaw was appointed to preach in St. Paul's; <NOTE PLACE="marg">22d June.</NOTE> and having cho&s;en this pa&s;&s;age for his text, <HI>Ba&s;tard &s;lips &s;hall not thrive,</HI> he enlarged on all the topics, which could di&s;credit the birth of Ed|ward IV. the duke of Clarence, and of all their children. He then broke out in a panygeric on the duke of Gloce&s;ter; and exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Behold this excellent prince, the expre&s;s image of his noble father, the genuine de&s;cendant of the hou&s;e of York, bearing, no le&s;s in the virtues of his mind, than in the features of his countenance, the character of the gallant Richard, once your hero and favourite: He alone is entitled to your allegiance: He mu&s;t deliver you from the dominion of all intruders: He alone can re&s;tore the lo&s;t glory and honour of the nation."</Q> It was previou&s;ly contrived, that, as the doctor &s;hould pro|nounce the&s;e words, the duke of Gloce&s;ter &s;hould enter the church; and it was expected that the audience &s;hould cry out, <HI>God &s;ave King Richard;</HI> which would immediately have been laid hold of as a popular con&s;ent, and interpreted to be the voice of the nation: But by a ridiculous mi&s;take, worthy of the whole &s;cene, the duke did not appear, till after this exclamation was already recited by the preacher. The doctor was therefore obliged to repeat his rhetorical figure out of its proper place: The audience, le&s;s from the ab&s;urd conduct of the di&s;cour&s;e, than from their dete&s;tation of the&s;e proceedings, kept a profound &s;ilence; and the Protector and his preacher, were equally aba&s;hed at the ill &s;ucce&s;s of their &s;trata|gem.</P>
<P>BUT the duke was too far advanced to recede from his criminal and ambitious projects. A new expedient was tried to work on the people. The mayor, who was brother to doctor Shaw, and entirely in the Protector's intere&s;ts, called an a&s;&s;embly of the citizens; where the duke of Buckingham, a man who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome talents for eloquence, harangued them on the Protector's title to the throne, and di&s;played tho&s;e numerous virtues, of which, he pretended, that prince was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. He then a&s;ked them, whether they would not have the duke for King? and then &s;topt, in expectation of hearing the cry, <HI>God &s;ave King Richard.</HI> He was &s;urprized to ob&s;erve them &s;ilent; and turning about to the mayor, he a&s;ked him the rea&s;on. The mayor replied, that perhaps they did not under&s;tand him. Buckingham then repeated his di&s;cour&s;e with &s;ome variation; inforced the &s;ame topics, a&s;ked the &s;ame que&s;tion, and was received with the &s;ame &s;ilence. <Q REND="inline">"I now &s;ee the cau&s;e,"</Q> &s;aid the mayor, <Q REND="inline">"the citizens are not accu&s;tomed to be harangued by any but

their recorder; and know not how to an&s;wer a per&s;on of your grace's quality."</Q> The recorder, Fitz-Williams, was then commanded to repeat the &s;ub&s;tance of the duke's &s;peech; but the man, who was very aver&s;e to the office, took care, throughout his whole di&s;cour&s;e, to have it under&s;tood, that he &s;poke nothing of him&s;elf, and that he only conveyed to them the &s;en&s;e of the duke of Buckingham. Still the audience kept a profound &s;ilence: <Q REND="inline">"This is wonderful ob&s;tinacy,"</Q> cried the duke: <Q REND="inline">"Expre&s;s your meaning, my friends, one way or other: When we app y to you on this occa&s;ion, it is merely from the regard which we bear to you. The lords and commons have &s;ufficient authority, without your con&s;ent, to appoint a King: But I require you here to declare in plain terms, whether or not you will have the duke of Gloce&s;ter for your &s;overeign."</Q> After all the&s;e efforts, &s;ome of the meane&s;t apprentices, incited by the Protector's and Bucking|ham's &s;ervants, rai&s;ed a feeble cry, <HI>God &s;ave King Richard</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Thomas More, p. 496.</NOTE>: The &s;entiments of the nation were now &s;ufficiently declared: The voice of the people was the voice of God: <NOTE PLACE="marg">25th June.</NOTE> And Buckingham with the mayor, ha&s;tened to Baynard's ca&s;tle, where the Protector then re&s;ided, that they might engage him to a&s;&s;ume the govern|ment.</P>
<P>WHEN Richard was told, that a great multitude was in the court, he refu&s;ed to appear to them, and pretended to be apprehen&s;ive for his per&s;onal &s;afety: A circum&s;tance much taken notice of by Buckingham, who ob&s;erved to the citizens, that the prince was ignorant of the whole de&s;ign. At la&s;t, he was per&s;uaded to come forth, but he &s;till kept at &s;ome di&s;tance; and he a&s;ked the meaning of their intru&s;ion and importunity. Buckingham told him, that the nation were re&s;olved to have him for King: The Protector declared his purpo&s;e to maintain his loyalty to the pre&s;ent &s;overeign, and exhorted them to adhere to the &s;ame re&s;olution.

Yet in the reign of Charles II. when there was occa&s;ion to remove &s;ome &s;tones and to dig into the very &s;pot, which was mentioned as the place of their fir&s;t interment, the bones of two per&s;ons were there found, which by their &s;ize corre&s;ponded exactly to the age of Edward and his brother: They were concluded with certainty to be the remains of tho&s;e princes, and were interred under a marble monument by orders of King Charles<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 551.</NOTE>. Perhaps, Richard's chaplain had died before he found an opportunity of execut|ing his ma&s;ter's commands; and the bodies being &s;uppo&s;ed to be already re|moved, a diligent &s;earch was not made for them by Henry in the place where they had been interred.</P>

<P><MILESTONE UNIT="year"> THE fir&s;t acts of Richard's admini&s;tration were to be&s;tow rewards on tho&s;e who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in u&s;urping the crown, and to gain by favours tho&s;e, who, he thought, were be&s;t able to &s;upport his future government. Thomas, lord Howard, was created duke of Norfolk; Sir Thomas Howard, his &s;on, earl of S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">; lord Lovel, a vi&s;count by the &s;ame name; even lord Stanley was &s;et at liberty and made lord Steward of the hou&s;ehold. This nobleman had become obnoxious by his fir&s;t oppo&s;ition to Richard's views, and al&s;o by his marrying the counters dowager of Richmond, the heire&s;s of the Somer&s;et family; but &s;en&s;ible of the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the pre&s;ent government, he counterfeited &s;uch zeal for Richard's cau&s;e, that he was received into favour, and even found means to be entru&s;ted with the mo&s;t important commands by that politic and jealous tyrant.</P>
<P>BUT the per&s;on, who, both from the greatne&s;s of his &s;ervices and the power and &s;plendor of his family, was be&s;t intitled to favours under the new government, was the duke of Buckingham; and Richard &s;eemed determined to &s;pare no pains nor bounty in &s;ecuring him to his intere&s;ts. Buckingham was de&s;cended from a daughter of Thomas of Wood&s;tock, duke of Gloce&s;ter, uncle to Richard II. and by this pedigree, he was both allied to the royal family, and had claims for dignities as well as e&s;tates, of a very exten&s;ive nature. The duke of Gloce&s;ter and Henry, earl of Derby, afterwards Henry IV. had married the two daugh|ters and co-heirs of Bohun, earl of Hereford, one of the greate&s;t of the antient barons, who&s;e immen&s;e property came thus to be divided into two &s;hares. The one was inherited by the family of Buckingham; the other was united to the crown by the family of Lanca&s;ter, and after the forfeiture of that royal line, was &s;eized as legally devolved to them, by the &s;overeigns of the hou&s;e of York. The duke of Buckingham laid hold of the pre&s;ent opportunity, and claimed the re|&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">tution of that portion of the Hereford e&s;tate, which had e&s;cheated to the crown, as well as of the great office of con&s;table, which had long continued by inheri|tance in his ance&s;tots of that family. Richard readily complied with the&s;e de|mands, which were probably the price &s;tipulated to Buckingham for his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance in promoting the u&s;urpation. That nobleman was in&s;talled in the office of con&s;table; he received a grant of the e&s;urpation of Hereford<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dugdale Baron. vol. 1. p. 168, 169.</NOTE>; many other dignities
<PB N="431" REF="439">
and honours were conferred upon him; and the King thought him&s;elf &s;ecure of pre&s;erving the fidelity of a man, who&s;e intere&s;ts &s;eemed to be &s;o clo&s;ely connect|ed with tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent government.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Duke of Buckingham di&s;contented.</NOTE> BUT it was impo&s;&s;ible, that friend&s;hip could long remain inviolate between two men of &s;uch corrupt morals as Richard and the duke of Buckingham. Hi&s;|torians a&s;cribe their fir&s;t quarrel to the King's refu&s;al of making re&s;titution of the Hereford e&s;tate; but it is certain from records, that he pa&s;&s;ed a grant for that purpo&s;e, and that the full demands of Buckingham were &s;atisfied in this particu|lar. Perhaps, Richard was &s;oon &s;en&s;ible of the danger which might en&s;ue from conferring &s;uch an immen&s;e property on a man of &s;o turbulent a character, and afterwards rai&s;ed difficulties about the execution of his own grant: Perhaps he refu&s;ed &s;ome other demands of Buckingham, whom he found it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;a|tisfy for his pa&s;t &s;ervices: Perhaps, he re&s;olved, according to the u&s;ual maxim of politicians, to &s;eize the fir&s;t opportunity of ruining this powerful &s;ubject, who had been the principal in&s;trument of his own elevation; and the di&s;covery of this intention begot the fir&s;t &s;u&s;picions in the duke of Buckingham. However this may be, it is certain, that the duke, &s;oon after Richard's acce&s;&s;ion, began to form a con&s;piracy again&s;t the government, and attempted to overthrow that u&s;ur|pation, which he him&s;elf had &s;o zealou&s;ly contributed to e&s;tabli&s;h.</P>
<P>NEVER was there an u&s;urpation in any country more flagrant than that of Richard, nor more repugnant to every principle of ju&s;tice and public intere&s;t. His claim was entirely founded on impudent allegations, never attempted to be proved, &s;ome of them incapable of proof, and all of them, implying &s;canda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ous reflections on his own family, and on the per&s;ons with whom he was the mo&s;t nearly connected. His title was never acknowledged by any rational a&s;&s;embly, &s;carce even by the lowe&s;t populace to whom he appealed; and had become preva|lent merely for want of &s;ome per&s;on of di&s;tinction, who might &s;tand forth again&s;t him, and give a voice to tho&s;e &s;entiments of general dete&s;tation, which aro&s;e in every bo&s;om.

To endure &s;uch a bloody u&s;urper &s;eemed to draw di&s;grace upon the nation, and to be at|tended with immediate danger to every individual, who was di&s;tingui&s;hed by his birth, merit, or &s;ervices. Such was become the general v ice of the people; all parties were united in the &s;ame &s;entiments; and the Lanca&s;trians, &s;o long oppre&s;|&s;ed, and, of late, &s;o much di&s;credited, felt their bla&s;ted hopes again revive, and

anxiou&s;ly attended to the con&s;equences of the&s;e extraordinary events. The duke of Buckingham, who&s;e family had been devoted to that intere&s;t, and who, by his mother, a daughter of Edmund, duke of Somer&s;et, was allied to the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, was ea&s;ily inclined to e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of this party, and to endea|vour the re&s;toring it to its antient &s;uperiority.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> HENRY, earl of Richmond, was at this time detained in a kind of honourable cu&s;tody by the duke of Brittany; and his de&s;cent, which &s;eemed to give him &s;ome preten&s;ions to the crown, had been a great object of jealou&s;y both in the late and in the pre&s;ent reign. John, the fir&s;t duke of Somer&s;et, who was grand&s;on of John of Gaunt, by a &s;purious branch, but legitimated by act of parliament, had left only one daughter, Margaret; and his younger brother, Edmund, had &s;uc|ceeded him in his titles, and in a con&s;iderable part of his fortune. Margaret had e&s;pou&s;ed Edmund, earl of Richmond, half brother of Henry VI. and &s;on of Sir Owen Tudor and Catherine of France, relict of Henry V. and &s;he bore him on|ly one &s;on, who received the name of Henry, and who after his father's death, inherited the honours and fortune of Richmond. His mother, being a widow, had e&s;pou&s;ed in &s;econd marriage Sir Henry Stafford, uncle to Buckingham, and after the death of that gentleman, had married the pre&s;ent lord Stanley; but had no children by either of the&s;e hu&s;bands; and her &s;on, Henry, was thus, in the event of her death, the only lawful heir of all her fortunes. But this was not the mo&s;t con&s;iderable advantage, which he had rea&s;on to expect from her &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: He would repre&s;ent the elde&s;t branch of the hou&s;e of Somer&s;et; he would inhe|rit all the title of that family to the crown; and tho' its claim, while any legiti|mate branch &s;ub&s;i&s;ted of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, had always been much di&s;regard|ed, the zeal of faction, after the death of Henry VI. and the murder of prince Edward, immediately conferred a weight and con&s;ideration upon it.</P>
<P>KING Edward IV. finding, that all the Lanca&s;trians had ca&s;t their eyes to|wards the young earl of Richmond, as the object of their hopes, thought him al&s;o worthy of his attention; and pur&s;ued him into his retreat in Brittany, whi|ther his uncle, the earl of Pembroke, had carried him, after the battle of Teuke&s;|bury, &s;o fatal to his party. He applied to Francis II. duke of Brittany, who was his ally, a weak but a good prince; and de&s;ired him to deliver up this &s;ugi|tive,
<PB N="433" REF="441">
who might be the &s;ource of future di&s;turbances in England: But the duke, aver&s;e to &s;o di&s;honourable a propo&s;al, would only con&s;ent, that, for the &s;ecurity of Edward, the young nobleman &s;hould be detained in cu&s;tody; and he received an annual pen&s;ion from England for the &s;afe keeping or &s;ub&s;i&s;tance of his pri&s;o|ner. But towards the end of Edward's reign, when the kingdom was menaced with a war both from France and Scotland, the anxieties of the Engli&s;h court with regard to Henry were very much encrea&s;ed; and Edward made a new pro|po&s;al to the duke, which covered, under the faire&s;t appearances, the mo&s;t bloody and treacherous intentions. He pretended, that he was de&s;irous of gaining his enemy, and of uniting him to his own family by a marriage with his daughter, Elizabeth; and he &s;ollicited to have him &s;ent over to England, for the executing a &s;cheme, which would redound &s;o much to his advantage. The&s;e pretences, &s;econded by bribes to Peter Landais, a corrupt mini&s;ter, by whom the duke was entirely governed, gained credit with the court of Brittany: Henry was deliver|ed into the hands of the Engli&s;h agents: He was ready to embark: When a &s;u&s;|picion of Edward's real de&s;ign was &s;ugge&s;ted to the duke, who recalled his orders, and thus &s;aved the unhappy youth from the imminent danger, which hang over him.</P>
<P>THESE &s;ymptoms of continued jealou&s;y in the reigning family of England, both &s;eemed to give &s;ome authority to Henry's preten&s;ions, and made him the object of general favour and compa&s;&s;ion, on account of the dangers and per&s;ecu|tions to which he was expo&s;ed. The univer&s;al dete&s;tation of Richard's conduct turned &s;till more the attention of the nation towards him; and as all the de&s;cen|dants of the hou&s;e of York were either women or minors, he &s;eemed to be the only per&s;on from whom the nation could expect the expul&s;ion of the odious and bloody tyrant. But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e circum&s;tances, which were &s;o favour|able to Henry, Buckingham and the bi&s;hop of Ely well knew, that there would &s;till lie many ob&s;tructions in his way to the throne; and that tho' the nation had been extremely divided between Henry VI. and the duke of York, when pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and hereditary right &s;tood in oppo&s;ition to each other; yet, &s;o &s;oon as the&s;e titles were conjoined by Edward IV. the bulk of the people had come over to the reigning family; and the Lanca&s;trians had extremely decayed, both in numbers and authority. It was therefore &s;ugge&s;ted by Morton, and readily a&s;|&s;ented to by the duke, that the only means of overturning the pre&s;ent u&s;urpation, was to unite the oppo&s;ite factions, by contracting a marriage between the earl of Richmond and the prince&s;s Elizabeth, elde&s;t daughter of King Edward, and thereby blending together the oppo&s;ite preten&s;ions of their families, which had &s;o long been the &s;ource of public di&s;orders and convul&s;ions. They were &s;en&s;ible,
<PB N="434" REF="442">
that the people were extremely de&s;irous of repo&s;e after &s;o many bloody and de&s;tructive commotions; that both Yorki&s;ts and Lanca&s;trians, who now lay equally under oppre&s;&s;ion, would embrace this &s;cheme with ardour; and that the pro&s;pect of reconciling the two parties, which was in it&s;elf &s;o de&s;irable an end, would, when added to the general hatred of the pre&s;ent government, render their cau&s;e ab&s;o|lutely invincible. In con&s;equence of the&s;e views, the prelate, by means of Re|ginald Bray, &s;teward to the counte&s;s of Richmond, opened the fir&s;t propo&s;als of both an union to that lady; and the &s;cheme appeared &s;o advantageous for her &s;on, and, at the &s;ame time, &s;o likely to &s;ucceed, that it admitted not of the lea&s;t he|&s;itation. Dr. Lewis, a Wei&s;h phy&s;ician, who had acce&s;s to the Queen-dowager in her &s;anctuary, carried the propo&s;als to her; and found, that revenge for the murder of her brother and of her three &s;ons, apprehen&s;ions for her remaining family, re&s;entment of her confinement and oppre&s;&s;ions, ea&s;ily overcame all her prejudices again&s;t the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, and procured her approbation of a mar|riage, to which the age and birth, as well as the pre&s;ent &s;ituation, of the two parties, &s;eemed &s;o naturally to invite them. She &s;ecretly borrowed a &s;um of money in the city, &s;ent it over to the earl of Richmond, required his oath to fulfil the marriage as &s;oon as he &s;hould arrive in England, advi&s;ed him to levy as many foreign forces as po&s;&s;ible, and promi&s;ed to join him, on his fir&s;t ap|pearance, with all the friends and partizans of her family.</P>
<P>THE plan being thus laid upon the &s;olid foundations of good &s;en&s;e and &s;ound policy, it was &s;ecretly communicated to the principal per&s;ons of both parties in all the counties of England; and a wonderful alacrity appeared in every order of men, to forward its &s;ucce&s;s and completion. But it was impo&s;&s;ible, that &s;o ex|ten&s;ive a con&s;piracy could be conducted &s;o &s;ecretly as entirely to e&s;cape the jealous and vigilant eye of Richard; and he &s;oon received intelligence, that his enemies, headed by the duke of Buckingham, were forming &s;ome de&s;ign again&s;t his au|thority. He immediately put him&s;elf in a po&s;ture of defence by levying &s;ome troops in the North; and he &s;ummoned the duke to appear at court, in &s;uch terms as &s;eemed to promi&s;e him a renewal of their former friend&s;hip. <NOTE PLACE="marg">October.</NOTE> But that nobleman, well acquainted with the barbarity and treachery of Richard, replied only by taking arms in Wales, and giving the &s;ignal to his accomplices for a general in&s;urrection in all parts of England.

But being detected in his retreat, he was brought to the King at Sali&s;bury; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Buckingham executed.</NOTE> and was in&s;tantly tried, condemned, and executed, according to the &s;ummary method practi&s;ed in tho&s;e ages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t.

<P><MILESTONE N="1484" UNIT="year"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">23d of Jan.</NOTE> THE King, thus triumphant in all places, and &s;trengthened by this un&s;uc|ce&s;sful attempt to dethrone him, ventured at la&s;t to &s;ummon a parliament; a mea&s;ure which his crimes and flagrant u&s;urpation had made him hitherto de|cline. Tho' it was natural that the parliament, in a conte&s;t of national parties, &s;hould always adhere to the victor, he &s;eems to have apprehended, le&s;t his title, founded on no principle, and &s;upported by no party, might be rejected by that a&s;&s;embly. But his enemies being now at his feet, the parliament had no choice but to recognize his authority, and acknowledge his right to the crown. His only &s;on Edward, then a youth of twelve years of age, was created prince of Wales: The duties of tonnage and poundage were granted him for life: And Richard, in order to reconcile the nation to his government, pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome popu|lar laws, particularly one again&s;t the late practice of extorting money on pretence of benevolences.</P>
<P><PB N="436" REF="444">
ALL the other mea&s;ures of the King tended to the &s;ame object. Sen&s;ible, that the only circum&s;tance which could give him &s;ecurity was to gain the confidence of the Yorki&s;ts, he paid court to the Queen-dowager with &s;uch art and addre&s;s, made &s;uch earne&s;t prote&s;tations of his &s;incere good-will and friend&s;hip, that this prince&s;s, tired of confinement, and de&s;pairing of any &s;ucce&s;s from her former projects, ventured to leave her &s;anctuary, and to put her&s;elf and her daughters into the hands of the tyrant. But he &s;oon carried farther his views for the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of his throne. He had married Anne, the &s;econd daughter of the earl of Warwic, and widow of Edward prince of Wales, whom Richard him&s;elf had murdered; but this prince&s;s having born him but one &s;on, who died about this time, he con&s;idered her as an invincible ob&s;tacle to the &s;ettlement of his fortune, and he was believed to have carried her off by poi&s;on; a crime for which the public could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to have any very &s;olid proof, but which the u&s;ual tenor of his conduct made it rea&s;onable to &s;u&s;pect. He now thought it in his power to remove the chief perils which threatened his government. The earl of Richmond, he knew, could never be dangerous but from his projected marriage with the prince&s;s Elizabeth, the true heir of the crown; and he there|fore intended, by means of a papal di&s;pen&s;ation, to e&s;pou&s;e him&s;elf this prince&s;s, and thus to unite in his own family their contending titles. The Queen-dowager, eager to recover her lo&s;t authority, neither &s;crupled this alliance, which was very unu&s;ual in England, and was regarded as ince&s;tuous; nor felt any horror at mar|rying her daughter to the murderer of her three &s;ons and of her brother: She even conjoined &s;o far her intere&s;ts with tho&s;e of the u&s;urper, that &s;he wrote to all her partizans, and among the re&s;t, to her &s;on the marqui&s;s of Dor&s;et, de&s;iring them to withdraw from the earl of Richmond; an injury which the earl could never afterwards forgive: The court of Rome was applied to for a di&s;pen&s;ation: Richard thought, that he could ea&s;ily defend him&s;elf during the interval, till it arrived; and he had afterwards the agreeable pro&s;pect of a full and &s;ecure &s;ettle|ment. He flattered him&s;elf, that the Engli&s;h nation, &s;eeing all danger removed of a di&s;puted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, would then acquie&s;ce under the dominion of a prince, who was of mature years, of great abilities, and of a genius qualified for govern|ment; and that they would forgive him all the crimes which he had committed in paving his way to the throne.</P>
<P>BUT the crimes of Richard were &s;o horrid and &s;o &s;hocking to humanity, that the natural &s;entiments of men, without any political or public views, were &s;uffi|cient to render his government un&s;table; and every per&s;on of probity and honour was earne&s;t to prevent the &s;ceptre from being farther polluted by that bloody and treacherous hand which held it. All the exiles flocked to the earl of Richmond

in Brittany, and exhorted him to ha&s;ten his attempt of a new inva&s;ion, and to prevent the marriage of the prince&s;s Elizabeth, which mu&s;t prove &s;o fatal to all his hopes. The earl, &s;en&s;ible of the urgent nece&s;&s;ity, but dreading the treachery of Peter Landais, who had entered into a negotiation with Richard for delivering him up, was obliged to attend only to his pre&s;ent &s;afety; and he made his e&s;cape to the court of France. The mini&s;ters of Charles VIII. who had now &s;ucceeded to the throne after the death of his father Lewis, gave him countenance and pro|tection; and being de&s;irous of rai&s;ing di&s;turbances to Richard, they &s;ecretly en|couraged the earl in the levies which he made for the &s;upport of his enterprize again&s;t England. The earl of Oxford, whom Richard's &s;u&s;picions had thrown into confinement, having made his e&s;cape, here joined Henry; and enflamed his ardour for the attempt, by the favourable accounts which he brought of the di&s;|po&s;itions of the Engli&s;h nation, and their univer&s;al hatred of Richard's crimes and u&s;urpation.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1485" UNIT="year"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Inva&s;ion by the earl of Richmond. 7th of Aug</NOTE> THE earl of Richmond &s;et out from Har&s;leur in Normandy with a retinue of about 2000 per&s;ons; and after a navigation of &s;ix days, he arrived at Milford-Haven in Wales, where he landed without oppo&s;ition. He directed his cour&s;e to that part of the kingdom, in hopes that the Wel&s;h, who regarded him as their countryman, and who had been already prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in &s;avour of his cau&s;e by means of the duke of Buckingham, would join his &s;tandard, and enable him to make head again&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;hed government. Richard, who knew not in what quarter he might expect the invader, had taken po&s;t at Nottingham, in the centre of the kingdom; and having given commi&s;&s;ions to different per&s;ons in the &s;everal counties, whom he empowered to oppo&s;e his enemy, he propo&s;ed in per|&s;on to fly, on the fir&s;t alarm, to the place which was expo&s;ed to danger. Sir Rice ap Thomas and Sir Walter Herbert were entru&s;ted with this authority in Wales; but the former immediately de&s;erted to Henry; the &s;econd made but &s;eeble oppo&s;ition to him: And the earl, advancing towards Shrew&s;bury, received every day &s;ome reinforcement from his partizans. Sir Gilbert Talbot joined him with all the va&s;&s;als and retainers of the family of Shrew&s;bury: Sir Thomas Bour|chier, Sir Walter Hungerford, brought their friends to &s;hare his fortune; and the appearance of men of di&s;tinction in his camp made already the cau&s;e wear a favourable a&s;pect.</P>
<P>BUT the danger to which Richard was chiefly expo&s;ed, proceeded not &s;o much from the zeal of his open enemies, as from the infidelity of his pretended friends. Scarce any nobleman of di&s;tinction was &s;incerely attached to his cau&s;e, except the duke of Norfolk; and all tho&s;e who feigned the mo&s;t loyalty were only watching
<PB N="438" REF="446">
an opportunity to betray and de&s;ert him. But the per&s;ons of whom he enter|tained the greate&s;t &s;u&s;picion, were the lord Stanley and his brother Sir William; who&s;e connexions with the earl of Richmond, notwith&s;tanding their profe&s;&s;ions of attachment to his per&s;on, were never entirely forgot or overlooked by him. When he empowered lord Stanley to levy forces, he &s;till retained his elde&s;t &s;on, lord Strange, as a pledge of his fidelity; and that nobleman was, on this ac|count, obliged to employ great precaution and re&s;erve in his proceedings. He rai&s;ed a powerful body of his friends and retainers in Che&s;hire and Lanca&s;hire, but without openly declaring him&s;elf: And tho' Henry had received &s;ecret a&s;|&s;urances of his friendly intention, the armies on both &s;ides knew not what to in|fer from his equivocal behaviour. <NOTE PLACE="marg">of A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">g Battle of Bo&s;|worth.</NOTE> The two rivals, at la&s;t, approached each other, at Bo&s;worth near Leice&s;ter; Henry at the head of &s;ix thou&s;and men, Richard with an army of above double the number; and a deci&s;ive action was every hour looked for between them. Stanley, who commanded about &s;even thou&s;and men, took care to po&s;t him&s;elf at Ather&s;tone, not far from the expected field of battle; and he made &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition as enabled him on occa&s;ion to join either party. Richard had too much &s;agacity not to di&s;cover his intentions from the&s;e movements; but he kept the &s;ecret from his own men for fear of di&s;cou|raging them: He took not immediate revenge on Stanley's &s;on, as &s;ome of his courtiers advi&s;ed him; becau&s;e he hoped that &s;o valuable a pledge would induce the father to prolong &s;till farther his ambiguous conduct: And he ha&s;tened to decide by arms the quarrel with his competitor; being certain, that a victory over the earl of Richmond would enable him to take ample revenge of all his ene|mies, open and concealed.</P>
<P>THE van of Richmond's army, con&s;i&s;ting of archers, was commanded by John earl of Oxford: Sir Gilbert Talbot led the right wing; Sir John Savage the left: The earl him&s;elf, accompanied by his uncle, the earl of Pembroke, placed him&s;elf in the main body. Richard al&s;o took po&s;t in <HI>his</HI> main body, and en|tru&s;ted the command of his van to the duke of Norfolk: As his wings were never engaged, we have not learned the names of the &s;everal commanders. Soon after the battle began, lord Stanley, who&s;e conduct in this whole affair di&s;covers great precaution and abilities, appeared in the field, and declared for the earl of Richmond. This mea&s;ure, which was &s;o unexpected to the men, tho' not to their leaders, had a proportional effect on both armies: It in&s;pired unu&s;ual cou|rage into Henry's &s;oldiers; it threw Richard's into di&s;may and confu&s;ion.

His men every where &s;ought for &s;afety by flight.</P>
<P>THERE fell in this battle about 4000 men on the &s;ide of the vanqui&s;hed; and among the&s;e the duke of Norfolk, the lord Ferrars of Chartley, Sir Richard Ratcliffe, Sir Robert Piercy, and Sir Robert Brakenbury. The lo&s;s was very incon&s;iderable on the &s;ide of the victors. Sir William Cate&s;by, a great in&s;tru|ment of Richard's crimes, was taken, and &s;oon after beheaded, with &s;ome others, at Leice&s;ter. The body of Richard was found in the field, covered with dead enemies, and all be&s;meared with blood: It was thrown carele&s;sly acro&s;s a hor&s;e; was carried to Leice&s;ter amid the &s;houts of the in&s;ulting &s;pectators; and was in|terred in the Gray-Friars church of that place.</P>

Nor is the &s;pectacle altogether unenter|taining and unin&s;tructive, which the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e times pre&s;ents to us. The view of human manners and actions, in all their variety of appearances, is both profitable and agreeable; and if the a&s;pect in &s;ome periods &s;eems horrid and de|formed, we may thence learn to cheri&s;h with the greater anxiety that &s;cience and civility which has &s;o clo&s;e a connexion with virtue and humanity, and which, as it is a &s;overeign antidote again&s;t &s;uper&s;tition, is al&s;o the mo&s;t effectual remedy again&s;t vice and di&s;orders of every kind.</P>
<P>THE ri&s;e, progre&s;s, perfection, and decline of art and &s;cience, are curious ob|jects of contemplation, and intimately confected with a narration of civil tran&s;|actions. The events of no particular period can be fully accounted for, but by con&s;idering the degrees of advancement, which men have reached in tho&s;e parti|culars.</P>
<P>THOSE who ca&s;t their eye on the general revolutions of &s;ociety, will find, that, as all the improvements of the human mind had reached nearly to their &s;tate of perfection about the age of Augu&s;tus, there was a &s;en&s;ible decline from that point or period; and men thenceforth relap&s;ed gradually into ignorance and barbari&s;m. The unlimited extent of the Roman empire, and the con&s;equent de&s;poti&s;m of the monarchs, extingui&s;hed all emulation, deba&s;ed the generous &s;pirits of men,
<PB N="441" REF="449">
and depre&s;&s;ed that noble flame, by which all the refined arts mu&s;t be cheri&s;hed and enlivened. The military government, which &s;oon &s;ucceeded, rendered even the lives and properties of men in&s;ecure and precarious; and proved de&s;tructive to tho&s;e vulgar and more nece&s;&s;ary arts of agriculture, manufactures, and com|merce; and in the end, to the military art, and genius it&s;elf, by which alone the immen&s;e fabric of the empire could be &s;upported. The irruption of the barba|rous nations, which &s;oon followed, overwhelmed all human knowledge, which was already far in its decline; and men &s;unk every age deeper into ignorance, &s;tu|pidity, and &s;uper&s;tition; till the light of antient &s;cience and hi&s;tory, had very nearly &s;uffered a total extinction in all the European nations.</P>
<P>BUT there is an ultimate point of depre&s;&s;ion, as well as of exaltation, from which human affairs naturally return in a contrary progre&s;s, and beyond which they &s;eldom pa&s;s either in their advancement or decline. The period, in which the people of Chri&s;tendom were the lowe&s;t &s;unk in ignorance, and con&s;equently in di&s;orders of every kind, may ju&s;tly be fixed at the eleventh century, about the age of William the Conqueror; and from that Aera, the &s;un of &s;cience, begin|ning to re-a&s;cend, threw out many gleams of light, which preceded the full morn|ing, when letters were revived in the fifteenth century. The Danes and other northern people, who had &s;o long infe&s;ted all the coa&s;ts, and even the inland parts of Eu|rope, by their depredations, having now learned the arts of tillage and agriculture, found a &s;ettled &s;ub&s;i&s;tance at home, and were no longer tempted to de&s;ert their indu&s;try, in order to &s;eek a precarious livelihood by rapine and by the plunder of their neighbours. The feudal governments al&s;o, among the more &s;outhern na|tions, were reduced to a kind of &s;y&s;tem; and tho' that &s;trange &s;pecies of civil polity was ill fitted to en&s;ure either liberty or tranquility, it was preferable to the univer&s;al licence and di&s;order, which had every where preceded it. But perhaps there was no event, which tended farther to the improvement of the age, than one, which has not been much remarked, the accidental finding a copy of Ju&s;ti|nian's Pandects, about the year 1130, in the town of Amal&s;i in Italy.</P>
<P>THE eccle&s;ia&s;tics, who had leizure, and &s;ome inclination to &s;tudy, immediately adopted with zeal this excellent &s;y&s;tem of jurifprudence, and &s;pread the knowledge of it in every part of Europe. Be&s;ides the intrin&s;ic merit of the performance, it was recommended to them by its original connexion with the imperial city of Rome, which, being the &s;eat of their religion, &s;eemed to acquire a new lu&s;tre and authority, by the diffu&s;ion of its laws over the we&s;tern world. In le&s;s than ten years after the di&s;covery of the Pandects, Vacarius, under the protection of Theo|bald, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, read public lectures of civil law in the univer&s;ity of Oxford; and the clergy every where, by their example as well as exhortation,
<PB N="442" REF="450">
were the means of &s;preading the highe&s;t e&s;teem for this new &s;cience. That order of men, having large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to defend, were in a manner nece&s;&s;itated to turn their &s;tudies towards the law; and their properties being often endangered by the violence of the princes and barons, it became their intere&s;t to enforce the ob&s;erv|ance of general and equitable rules, from which alone they could receive protec|tion. As they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the knowledge of the age, and were alone acquainted with the habits of thinking, the practice as well as &s;cience of the law, fell mo&s;tly into their hands: And tho' the clo&s;e connexion, which without any nece&s;&s;ity they formed between the canon and civil law, begot a jealou&s;y in the laity of England, and prevented the Roman juri&s;prudence from becoming the municipal law of the country, as was the ca&s;e in many &s;tates of Europe, a great part of it was &s;ecretly transferred into the practice of the courts of ju&s;tice, and the imitation of their neighbours, made the Engli&s;h gradually endeavour to rai&s;e their own law from its orig nal &s;tate of rudene&s;s and imperfection.</P>
<P>IT is ea&s;y to &s;ee what advantages Europe mu&s;t have reaped by its inheriting at once from the antients, &s;o complete an art, which was of it&s;elf &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for giving &s;ecurity to all other arts, and which, by refining, and &s;till more, by be|&s;towing &s;olidity on the judgment, &s;erved as a model to farther improvements. The &s;en&s;ible utility of the Roman law both to public and private intere&s;t recom|mended the &s;tudy of it, at a time when the more exalted and &s;peculative &s;ciences carried no charms with them; and thus the la&s;t branch of antient literature, which remained uncorrupted, was happily the fir&s;t tran&s;mitted to the modern world. For it is remarkable, that in the decline of Roman learning, when the philo&s;o|phers were univer&s;ally infected with &s;uper&s;tition and &s;ophi&s;try, and the poets and hi&s;torians with barbari&s;m, the lawyers, who in other countries are &s;eldom models of &s;cience or politene&s;s, were yet able, by the con&s;tant &s;tudy and clo&s;e imitation of their predece&s;&s;ors, to maintain the fame good &s;en&s;e in their deci&s;ions and rea|&s;onings, and the &s;ame purity in their language and expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>WHAT be&s;towed an additional merit on the civil law, was the extreme igno|rance and imperfection of that juri&s;prudence, which preceded it among all the European nations, e&s;pecially among the Saxons or antient Engli&s;h. What ab&s;ur|d ties prevailed at that time in the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, may be conceived from the authentic monuments which remain of the antient Saxon laws; where a pecuniary commutation was received for every crime, where &s;tated prices were fixed for men's lives and members, where private revenges were authorized for all injuries, where the u&s;e of the ordeal, corfnet, and afterwards of the duel, was the received method of proof, and where the judges were ru&s;tic freeholders, a&s;|embled of a &s;udden, and deciding a cau&s;e from one debate or altercation of the
<PB N="443" REF="451">
parties. Such a &s;tate of &s;ociety was very little advanced beyond the rude &s;tate of nature: Violence univer&s;ally prevailed, in&s;tead of general and equitable maxims: The pretended liberty of the times, was only an incapacity of &s;ubmitting to go|vernment: And men, not protected by law in their lives and properties, &s;ought &s;helter, by their per&s;onal &s;ervility and attachments, under &s;ome powerful chie&s;tain, or by voluntary combinations.</P>
<P>THE gradual progre&s;s of improvement, rai&s;ed the Europeans &s;omewhat from this uncultivated &s;tate; and affairs, in this i&s;land particularly, took very early a turn, which was more favourable to ju&s;tice and to liberty. Civil employments and occupations &s;oon became honourable among the Engli&s;h: The &s;ituation of that people rendered not the perpetual attention to wars &s;o nece&s;&s;ary as among their neighbours, and all regard was not confined to the military profe&s;&s;ion: The gen|try, and even the nobility, began to deem an acquaintance with the law, a requi|&s;ite part of education: They were le&s;s diverted than afterwards from &s;tudies of this kind by other &s;ciences; and in the age of Henry VI. we are told by Forte&s;|cue, there were in the Inns of Court about two thou&s;and &s;tudents, mo&s;t of them men of honourable birth, who gave application to this branch of civil know|ledge. A circum&s;tance which proves, that a con&s;iderable advance was already made in the &s;cience of government, and which progno&s;ticated &s;till a greater.</P>
<P>ONE chief advantage, which re&s;ulted from the introduction and progre&s;s of the arts, was the introduction and progre&s;s of freedom; and this con&s;equence af|fected men both in their <HI>per&s;onal</HI> and <HI>civil</HI> capacities.</P>
<P>IF we con&s;ider the antient &s;tate of Europe, we &s;hall find, that the far greater part of the &s;ociety were every where bereaved of their <HI>per&s;onal</HI> liberty, and lived entirely at the will of their ma&s;ters. Every one, that was not noble, was a &s;lave: The pea&s;ants were &s;old along with the land: The few inhabitants of cities were not in a better condition: Even the gentry them&s;elves were &s;ubjected to a long train of &s;ubordination under the greater barons or chief va&s;&s;als of the crown; who, tho' &s;eemingly placed in a high &s;tate of &s;plendor, yet, having but a &s;lender pro|tection from the law, were expo&s;ed to every tempe&s;t of &s;tate, and by the preca|rious condition, in which they lived, paid dearly for the power of oppre&s;&s;ing and tyrannizing over their inferiors. The fir&s;t incident, which broke in upon this violent &s;y&s;tem of government, was the practice, begun in France, of erecting communities and corporations, endowed with privileges and a &s;eparate municipal government, which gave them protection again&s;t the tyranny of the barons, and

The relaxation of the feudal tenures, and an execution, &s;omewhat &s;tricter, of the public law, be&s;tow|ed an independance on va&s;&s;als, which was unknown to their forefathers. And even the pea&s;ants them&s;elves, tho' later than other orders of the &s;tate, made their e&s;cape from tho&s;e bonds of villenage or &s;lavery, in which they had formerly been retained.</P>
<P>IT may appear &s;trange, that the progre&s;s of the arts, which &s;eems, among the Greeks and Romans, to have dai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">y encrea&s;ed the number of &s;laves, &s;hould, in later times, have proved &s;o general a &s;ource of liberty; but this difference of the events proceeded from a great difference in the circum&s;tances, which attended tho&s;e in&s;titutions. The antient barons, being obliged to maintain them&s;elves con|tinually in a military po&s;ture, and little emulous of elegance or &s;plendor, employ|ed not their villains as dome&s;tic &s;ervants, much le&s;s as manufacturers, but com|po&s;ed their retinue of free men, who&s;e military &s;pirit rendered the chieftain for|midable to his neighbours, and who were ready to attend him in every warlike enterprize. The villains were occupied entirely in the cultivation of their ma&s;|ter's land, and paid their rents either in corn and cattle and other produce of the farm, or in &s;ervile offices, which they performed about the baron's family, and upon the farms which he retained in his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. In proportion as agri|culture improved, and money encrea&s;ed, it was found, that the&s;e &s;ervices, tho' extremely burthen&s;ome to the villain, were of little advantage to the ma&s;ter; and that the produce of a large e&s;tate could be much more conveniently di&s;po&s;ed of by the pea&s;ant him&s;elf, who rai&s;ed it, than by the landlord or his bailiff, who were formerly accu&s;tomed to receive it. A commutation was therefore made of rents for &s;ervices, and of money rents for tho&s;e in kind; and as men, in a &s;ub|&s;equent age, di&s;covered, that farms were better cultivated where the farmer en|joyed a &s;ecurity of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the practice of granting lea&s;es to the pea&s;ant began to prevail, which entirely broke the bonds of &s;ervitude, already much relaxed from the former practices. Thus villenage went gradually into di&s;u&s;e through|out the more civilized parts of Europe: The intere&s;t of the ma&s;ter, as well as that of the &s;lave, concurred in this alteration. The late&s;t laws which we find in
<PB N="445" REF="453">
England for the enforcing or regulating this &s;pecies of &s;ervitude, were enacted in the reign of Henry VII. And tho' the antient &s;tatutes on this &s;ubject remain &s;till unrepealed by parliament, it appears, that, before the reign of Elizabeth, the di&s;tinction of villain and freeman was totally, tho' in&s;en&s;ibly aboli&s;hed, and that no per&s;on remained in the &s;tate, to whom the former laws could be applied.</P>
<P>THUS <HI>per&s;onal</HI> freedom became almo&s;t general in Europe; an advantage which paved the way for the encrea&s;e of <HI>political</HI> or <HI>civil</HI> liberty, and which, even where it was not attended with this &s;alutary effect, &s;erved to give the members of the community &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable advantages of it.</P>
<P>THE con&s;titution of the Engli&s;h government, ever &s;ince the inva&s;ion of this i&s;land by the Saxons, may boa&s;t of this pre-eminence, that in no age the will of the monarch was ever entirely ab&s;olute and uncontrouled: But in other re&s;pects the ballance of power has extremely &s;hifted among the &s;everal orders of the &s;tate; and this fabric has experienced the &s;ame mutability, which has attended all hu|man in&s;titutions.</P>
<P>THE antient Saxons, like the other German nations, where each individual was enured to arms, and where the independance of men was &s;ecured by a great equality of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, &s;eem to have admitted a con&s;iderable mixture of democracy into their form of government, and to have been one of the free&s;t nations, of which there remains any account in the records of hi&s;tory. After this tribe was &s;ettled in England, e&s;pecially after the di&s;&s;olution of the Heptarchy, the great extent of the kingdom produced a great inequality in property; and the ballance &s;eems to have inclined to the &s;ide of the Ari&s;tocracy. The Norman conque&s;t threw more authority into the hands of the &s;overeign, which, however, admitted of great controul; tho' derived le&s;s from the general forms of the con&s;titution, which were inaccurate and irregular, than from the independant power enjoyed by each baron in his particular di&s;trict or province. The e&s;tabli&s;hment of the great char|ter exalted &s;till higher the Ari&s;tocracy, impo&s;ed regular limits on royal power, and gradually introduced &s;ome mixture of Democracy into the con&s;titution. But even during this period, from the acce&s;&s;ion of Edward I. to the death of Richard III. the condition of the commons was no-wi&s;e de&s;irable; a kind of Poli&s;h Ari|&s;tocracy prevailed; and tho' the Kings were limited, the people were as yet far from being free. It required the authority almo&s;t ab&s;olute of the &s;overeigns, which took place in the &s;ub&s;equent period, to pull down the&s;e di&s;orderly and li|centious tyrants, who were equal enemies to peace and to freedom, and to e&s;tab|li&s;h that regular execution of the laws, which, in a following age, enabled the people to erect a regular and equitable plan of liberty.</P>

IN each of the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ive alterations, the only rule of government, which is intelligible or carries any authority with it, is the e&s;tabli&s;hed practice of the age, and the maxims of admini&s;tration, which are at that time prevalent, and uni|ver&s;ally a&s;&s;ented to. Tho&s;e who, from a pretended re&s;pect to antiquity, appeal at every turn to an original plan of the con&s;titution, only cover their turbulent &s;pirit and their private ambition under the appearance of venerable forms; and whatever period they pitch on for their model, they may &s;till be carried back to a more antient period, where they will find the mea&s;ures of power entirely dif|ferent, and where every circum&s;tance, by rea&s;on of the greater barbarity of the times, will appear &s;till le&s;s worthy of imitation. Above all, a civilized nation, like the Engli&s;h, who have happily e&s;tabli&s;hed the mo&s;t perfect and mo&s;t accurate &s;y&s;tem of liberty, that ever was found compatible with government, ought to be cautions of appealing to the practice of their ance&s;tors, or regarding the max|ims of uncultivated ages as certain rules for their pre&s;ent conduct. An acquain|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nce with the hi&s;tory of the remote periods of their government is chiefly <HI>u&s;eful</HI> by in&s;tructing them to cheri&s;h their pre&s;ent con&s;titution from a compari&s;on or contra&s;t with the condition of tho&s;e di&s;tant times. And it is al&s;o <HI>curious,</HI> by &s;howing them the remote, and commonly faint and disfigured originals of the mo&s;t fini&s;h|ed and mo&s;t noble in&s;titutions, and by in&s;tructing them in the great mixture of accident which commonly concurs with a &s;mall ingredient of wi&s;dom and fore|&s;ight, in erecting the complicated fabric of the mo&s;t perfect government.</P>
