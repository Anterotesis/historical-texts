<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT would be very flattering to me, if I might hope that the little Tale, which I now take the liberty of pre&s;enting to you, could amu&s;e a few moments of your tedious indi&s;po&s;ition. It is, I confe&s;s, but a paltry return for the many hours of agreeable information, and elegant amu&s;ement, which I have received from your &s;pirited and very entertaining writings: yet
<PB REF="3">
I am per&s;uaded, that you will receive it with favour, as a &s;mall offering of e&s;teem and gra|titude, of which the intention alone makes all the little value.</P>
<P>The &s;light ver&s;es, Sir, which I place under your protection, will not, I fear, impre&s;s the world with a very favourable idea of my poetical powers: But I &s;hall, at lea&s;t, be &s;u&s;pected of having &s;ome ta&s;te, and of keeping good com|pany, when I confe&s; s that &s;ome of the plea&s;ant|e&s;t hours of my life have been pa&s;&s;ed in your conver&s;ation. I &s;hould be unju&s;t to your very engaging and well-bred turn of wit, if I did not declare that, among all the lively and brilliant things I have heard from you, I do not remember ever to have heard an unkind, or an ungenerous one: Let me be allowed to bear my feeble te&s;timony to your temperate u&s;e of this charming faculty, &s;o delightful in
<PB REF="4">
it&s;elf, but which can only be &s;afely tru&s;ted in &s;uch hands as yours, where it is guarded by politene&s;s, and directed by humanity.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I have the honour to be, SIR, Your much obliged, And mo&s;t obedient Humble Servant,

<L>Prede&s;tin'd to a large e&s;tate!</L>
<L>Hence all the hopes he gave were foil'd;</L>
<L>His mind by prai&s;e and plea&s;ure &s;poil'd.</L>

<L>Poor FLORIO, at the ardent age <MILESTONE N="45"></L>

<L>When Life &s;hou'd open fre&s;h and fair,</L>

<L>Of youthful gaiety bereft,</L>

<L>He found already to his co&s;t,</L>
<L>The &s;hining glo&s;s of life was lo&s;t;</L>

<L>Tho' high renown the youth had gain'd,</L>
<L>No flagrant crimes his life had &s;tain'd;</L>
<L>No tool of fal&s;ehood, &s;lave of pa&s;&s;ion,</L>
<L>But &s;poilt by CUSTOM, and the FASHION.</L>
<L>Tho' known among <HI>a certain &s;et,</HI><MILESTONE N="65"></L>

<L><PB N="6" REF="11">His utmo&s;t credit, as a &s;inner,</L>

<L>Yet 'twas a hopeful indication,<MILESTONE N="75"></L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>His mornings were not &s;pent in vice,</L>

<L>Walk up and down St. James's Street,</L>
<L>Full fifty times the youth you'd meet:</L>

<L>A friend he had, BELLARIO hight,</L>
<L>A rea&s;oning, reading, learned wight;</L>
<L>At lea&s;t, with men of FLORIO'S breeding,</L>
<L>He was a prodigy of reading.</L>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Trifle owes its birth and name to the mi&s;take of a Foreigner of Di&s;tinction, who gave the literal appellation of the <HI>Bas-bleu,</HI> to a &s;mall party of friends, who had been &s;ometimes called, by way of plea&s;antry, the Blue Stockings. The &s;light per|formance, occa&s;ioned by this little circum&s;tance, was never intended to appear in print: It is, in general, too local, and too per&s;onal for publication; and was only written with a wi&s;h to amu&s;e the amiable Lady to whom it is addre&s;&s;ed, and a few partial friends. But copies having been multiplied, far beyond the intention of the Author, &s;he has been advi&s;ed to publi&s;h it, le&s;t it &s;hould &s;teal into the world in a &s;tate of &s;till greater imperfec|tion; though &s;he is almo&s;t a&s;hamed to take refuge in &s;o hackneyed an apology, however true.</P>
