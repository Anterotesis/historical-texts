<P>Oh, my dear, what's the matter, it is all along this wicked Mayor, he wants to make a widow of me&mdash;it would be for the public good if he was hanged, in&s;tead of my hu&s;band&mdash;</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I have a dull chance, my lord; but my lord, tho'I am but a poor fellow, the riche&s;t jewel in your lord&s;hip's coronet could not make me betray a per&s;on, after once giving him the protection of my roof.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Earl</SPEAKER>
<P>See him to execution&mdash;I will try him further.</P>

<P>My choice&mdash;my pride.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Earl</SPEAKER>
<P>I would &s;ooner have be&s;towed you on that pea&s;ant, that re&s;cued you from the Danes, for his valour at loa&s;t has a claim up|on my gratitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emma</SPEAKER>
<P>Then let Harold have that claim; he was that pea&s;ant, the protector of my life and honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Earl</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;ee now that my prejudice to Earl Goodwin, has blinded me to his &s;on's pecu|liar virtues, and what you have &s;aved&mdash;take for your reward.</P>
