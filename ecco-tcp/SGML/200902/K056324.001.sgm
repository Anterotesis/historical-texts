<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Papers of the Family of BRUNS|WICK-LUNENBURGH, and tho&s;e of the Hou&s;e of STUART, having been placed in the hands of the Author of the following volumes, he was encouraged to write the HISTORY OF GREAT BRITAIN, during a very important period. The new light thrown upon public tran&s;actions, the di&s;coveries made in the &s;ecret views of parties, the certainty e&s;tabli&s;hed with re|gard to the real characters of particular per&s;ons, and the undeviating ju&s;tice ren|dered to all, will, he hopes, atone for his defects as a writer, and recommend his work to the public. Unwilling to advance any matter of fact, without proof, he has printed his materials; and for their au|thenticity, he refers the reader to the pa|pers them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In the dates of great events, in facts which fell under public di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, in de|ci&s;ions of importance, in the &s;tate of debts, taxes, grants, and &s;upplies, he has availed him&s;elf of the records and journals of the two hou&s;es of parliament. In the detail of battles he has followed the be&s;t mili|tary writers; in well-known events, the authors who wrote in the times. In de|&s;cribing
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
the &s;ecret &s;prings of action, the private negociations of parties, the in|trigues of mini&s;ters and the motives of &s;o|vereigns, he has followed unerring guides, original papers. In relating the affairs of Great Britain, he has frequently introduc|ed a &s;ummary of the affairs of Europe. He has con&s;ulted, with the utmo&s;t attention, the be&s;t writers of foreign nations; and endeavoured to give a comprehen&s;ive view of the &s;tate of other countries, in order to throw a more complete light on our own.</P>
<P>Where the facts are important and but little known, the authorities have been carefully quoted. Where their truth is uni|ver&s;ally admitted, the author has been le&s;s anxious about the preci&s;ion of his citations. To crowd a margin with the names of dif|ferent writers, is an ea&s;y, and, perhaps, a harmle&s;s impo&s;ture. In the minds of the &s;uperficial, the expedient might e&s;tabli&s;h an opinion of an Author's indu&s;try and knowledge; but it would have little effect on the judicious, from who&s;e deci&s;ion he has mo&s;t to hope and to fear. To the latter, it may be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that he has con&s;ulted, on every point, a greater number of printed works, than he would chu&s;e to cite at the bottom of any page. He has taken no fact, in all its circum&s;tan|ces, from any one writer. His narrative is the general re&s;ult of an inten&s;e inquiry into what has been advanced on all &s;ides.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4">
In recording events, every po&s;&s;ible at|tention has been paid to the order of time. The dates have been carefully inve&s;tigated; and, where they are not interwoven with the work, are placed at the bottom of the page. In matters already known and ad|mitted, a comprehen&s;ive brevity has been &s;tudied. No circum&s;tance, however, has been neglected, no fact overlooked, that was thought either material in it&s;elf, or condu|cive to throw light on events of real im|portance. The intrigues of the cabinet have been more minutely recorded than the operations of the field. In the de&s;crip|tion of battles, &s;ieges, and naval engage|ments, the Author has endeavoured to be conci&s;e. But he has marked the outlines of military operations with a preci&s;ion that brings forward the whole figure di&s;tinctly to the view.</P>
<P>Where the tran&s;actions are mo&s;t impor|tant, and lea&s;t known, the greate&s;t labour and time have been be&s;towed. The in|trigues which preceded the Revolution, and were partly the cau&s;e of that event, are in|ve&s;tigated at an early period, and traced through their whole progre&s;s. The circum|&s;tances of the Revolution it&s;elf have been examined with the utmo&s;t care, and the mo&s;t undeviating attention to truth. The events that immediately followed the ac|ce&s;&s;ion of William and Mary, particularly the affairs of Ireland, have employed a
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
great deal of time, as they have hitherto been very imperfectly known. The nego|tiations of King James in France, his &s;e|cret intrigues with his former &s;ubjects, have been carefully connected with the great line of hi&s;tory; and their effects on public affairs, as well as on the conduct of particular per&s;ons, have been pointed out, as the circum&s;tances them&s;elves aro&s;e.</P>
<P>Upon the death of James, and the &s;ub|&s;equent demi&s;e of King William, the whole &s;y&s;tem of &s;ecret intrigues for the throne &s;uffered a material change. In the fir&s;t years of Queen Anne, the adherents of the Pretender abroad, fixed their hopes on the &s;uppo&s;ed affection of that Prince&s;s for her brother and family. Tho&s;e in Eng|land who were mo&s;t attached to the heredi|tary de&s;cent of the crown, entertained the &s;ame views. The di&s;turbances in Scotland, which terminated in the union of the two kingdoms, were &s;ucceeded by events, which are related with brevity, as they are in &s;ome mea&s;ure already known. But the change of men and mea&s;ures, which hap|pened in the year 1710, introduced a pe|riod of hi&s;tory that has been hitherto ve|ry little under&s;tood. The four la&s;t years of Queen Anne, therefore, co&s;t the Author much time and labour; and if he has not &s;ucceeded, his want of abilities mu&s;t be blamed, and not his want of information.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="6">
The reign of Charles the Second has been much inve&s;tigated by other writers. The cau&s;es of many of the mo&s;t important events are already &s;ufficiently known. But the ample extracts from the life of King James the Second, which were placed here in the Author's hands, the acce&s;s he had, in per&s;on, at Paris, to the papers of that Prince, together with &s;ome materials, equal|ly unknown, procured from other &s;ources, have enabled him to throw a new, and, he hopes, a complete light on that period. He was advi&s;ed to prefix only a review of that reign to his work. But he neither lik|ed that imperfect mode of writing hi&s;tory, nor could he be per&s;uaded, after he had ex|amined the &s;ubject, that any of his prede|ce&s;&s;ors had occupied the whole ground.</P>
<P>To decide on the execution of the work, is the province of the Public. To form &s;ome judgement of his own &s;entiments, may be fairly left to the Author. In his progre&s;s through his &s;ubject, he is not con|&s;cious of having once departed from the obvious line of evidence. He felt no pre|dilection for any party. He has, &s;urely, been bia&s;&s;ed by none. In his ob&s;ervations on the wor&s;t men, he has made allowan|ces for human pa&s;&s;ions. In commending the be&s;t, he was forced to remember their frailties. He con&s;idered him&s;elf through|out in the light of a judge upon mankind
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
and their actions; and, as he had no object but truth, he tru&s;ts he has attained his end.</P>
<P>To &s;peak with more warmth of the work, would be incompatible with the mo|de&s;ty, which writers ought to ob&s;erve when they treat of them&s;elves. To &s;ay le&s;s in its favour, the Author hopes, would be deemed incon&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice. With|out vanity, he may affirm, that the hi&s;tory of the period he has cho&s;en, has been hi|therto very IMPERFECTLY KNOWN. He is far from &s;uppo&s;ing, that the following vo|lumes are wholly free from errors. He hopes, however, that they are neither great nor many, with regard to matters of fact.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1660" UNIT="year"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Re&s;to|ration.</NOTE> CHARLES the Second was proclaimed, at London, on the eighth of May, in the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;ixty. He en|tered that city, on the twenty-ninth of the month, amid the acclamations of an infinite concour&s;e of &s;pectators. The two hou&s;es of parliament attend|ed the King, at Whitehall; and, by their &s;peakers, congratulated him, in terms full of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and loy|alty. The populace, with their u&s;ual extravagance,
<PB N="2" REF="16">
expre&s;&s;ed their &s;atisfaction in riot and intemperance. The terrors of anarchy and confu&s;ion yielded to the hopes of a regular &s;teadine&s;s in government. The pomp of royalty plea&s;ed the bulk of mankind; its novelty all. The change was great, but not &s;urpri&s;|ing, among a people, who had fallen, under an ab|ject &s;pecies of tyranny, after all their efforts to be free.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">State of the nation.</NOTE> The joy, which the re&s;toration of monarchy diffu&s;ed over the kingdom, &s;eemed to level all parties into a voluntary obedience to the King. The nation, how|ever, was not to be &s;ettled, at once, from the con|vul&s;ions which had overturned the throne. Jealou&s;ies, animo&s;ities, and high expectations, prevailed, among the adherents of monarchy. The independents were afraid of a retaliation of &s;everities. The Pre&s;byte|rians, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, de&s;paired of e&s;tabli&s;hing their favourite &s;y&s;tem of church-government. Silence and melancholy &s;eized the republican party, at the di&s;ap|pearance of all their hopes. The army, though, at different times, purged by Monk, were rather pa&s;&s;ive to his mea&s;ures, than fond of kingly government. Mo&s;t of the old &s;oldiers were fanatics. Even tho&s;e, who had attended the General from Scotland, obeyed him more from an affection to his per&s;on, than any regard to his political views. The eagerne&s;s of the body of the people, to return to the ancient con&s;titu|tion, had formed the firme&s;t foundation for its &s;upport. They regarded, in their elections, the political cha|racter of their repre&s;entatives. A great majority of tho&s;e, who were cho&s;en to &s;erve in the hou&s;e of com|mons, were men known for their attachment to mo|narchy, or remarkable for their moderate principles. The declaration from Breda had left the &s;ettlement of the nation in the parliament; and though the forms of their proceedings were productive of an inconve|nient delay, that important bu&s;ine&s;s could not be plac|ed in &s;afer or more able hands.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of the King.</NOTE> The di&s;po&s;ition and character of Charles, as far as they were THEN known, were well &s;uited to the times. Attached to no &s;y&s;tem of religion, he &s;eemed favourable to all. In appearance de&s;titute of political ambition, his &s;udden elevation was more an object of
<PB N="3" REF="17">
admiration, than of jealou&s;y. Accommodating in his profe&s;&s;ions and ea&s;y in his manner, he plea&s;ed even tho&s;e whom he could not gratify. Men, from prin|ciple, enemies to monarchy, were prejudiced in fa|vour of the per&s;on of the Prince. Tho&s;e in whom fear might excite aver&s;ion, lo&s;t their hatred, in his apparent forgetfulne&s;s of pa&s;t injuries. Though a lover of di&s;&s;ipation and plea&s;ure, he could bear con|finement, and had a talent for bu&s;ine&s;s. Though na|turally un&s;teady, he could a&s;&s;ume the appearance of firmne&s;s; and his quickne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion was mi&s;|taken, by the &s;uperficial, for uncommon abilities of mind. Adhering &s;trictly to no principle him&s;elf, he was not much offended at the want of it in others. He gained the profligate by indulgence; by his good-nature and attention, he flattered the pride of the virtuous. In&s;inuating, di&s;&s;embling, but frequently judicious, he came upon mankind, through the chan|nel of their ruling pa&s;&s;ions; and till his profe&s;&s;ions of regard to men of oppo&s;ite principles became too com|mon to be thought &s;incere, he gained the affection, if not the e&s;teem, of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>His accommodating character was the chief &s;upport of Charles throughout his reign. The carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of his mea&s;ures rai&s;ed him many opponents; but the ea&s;ine&s;s of his temper prevented him from having per&s;onal enemies. His defects, however, were not perceived when he mounted the throne. A penetrat|ing judge of the character of others, he was no &s;tranger to his own; and he re&s;olved to turn its faire&s;t &s;ide to the world. With too much good &s;en&s;e, to throw away, by wantonne&s;s and folly, what fortune had unexpectedly be&s;towed, he was cautious in his fir&s;t mea&s;ures; and, by the appearance of a &s;trict im|partiality in the di&s;tribution of his &s;avours, he di&s;|armed the mo&s;t inveterate among the parties which &s;till divided the nation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The mini|&s;try,</NOTE> A prudent choice of his principal &s;ervants promi&s;ed better mea&s;ures, than tho&s;e which Charles afterwards produced through his reign. He filled his council, in|deteriminately, from all parties. Ability was more re|garded, than political principle, or previous conduct.

Many, who had oppo&s;ed his father, were admitted into &s;tations near his own per&s;on. Several, who had &s;up|ported the late republic, were now employed in the &s;ervice of monarchy. The principal departments of the &s;tate were tru&s;ted to friends. Sir Edward Hyde, di&s;tingui&s;hed for his fidelity, as well as for his talents in bu&s;ine&s;s, was made chancellor. The Marquis of Ormonde, more remarkable for his honour and inte|grity, than for great abilities, was con&s;tituted &s;teward of the hou&s;ehold. The trea&s;ury, after having been for near nine months in commi&s;&s;ion, was delivered over to the &s;ole management of the Earl of South|ampton<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Feb. 1661.</NOTE> a man of un&s;haken firmne&s;s and unble|mi&s;hed reputation. The Duke of York was inve&s;ted with the office of lord high admiral of England. Monk, created ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e to the King, was continued captain-general of all the forces in the three kingdoms. Nicholas, a man of unbia&s;&s;ed integrity and experience in the &s;ervice of the crown, and Mor|rice, who owed his elevation to the patronage of Monk, were &s;ecretaries of &s;tate.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">their cha|racter.</NOTE> To re&s;tore ju&s;tice to its ancient cour&s;e, employed the fir&s;t care of the King and his &s;ervants. The courts in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall were filled with judges of known abilities in their profe&s;&s;ion; of profe&s;&s;ed af|fection to monarchy, and the re-e&s;tabli&s;hed laws. The &s;ervants of the crown opened a free and friendly intercour&s;e with the leading members of both hou|&s;es<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">James II. 1660.</NOTE>. They concerted the be&s;t mea&s;ures for carry|ing on the bu&s;ine&s;s with expedition and &s;ucce&s;s. The King him&s;elf &s;eemed inclined to manage the great af|fairs of the nation, through the medium of an a&s;&s;em|bly to whom he owed his throne. An enemy to trou|ble, and fond of plea&s;ure, he threw early the weight of the &s;tate on his mini&s;ters. Hyde po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t credit and the greate&s;t power. Indefatigable in his nature, and placing even his amu&s;ement in bu&s;ine&s;s, he was the mo&s;t experienced, and, perhaps, the mo&s;t able of the &s;ervants of the crown. Southampton, though a man of abilities, was indolent; Monk,
<PB N="5" REF="19">
more ver&s;ant in the labours of the field, than the in|trigues of the cabinet. Nicholas, unambitious in his character, &s;acrificed the importance of his office to his high opinion of the chancellor's talents; Morrice, though a man of integrity, lo&s;t his con&s;equence, in his ignorance of foreign affairs. Ormonde, in the warmth of a &s;incere friend&s;hip, adhered in every thing to Hyde. The Duke of York, by the expre&s;s orders of the King, lived on the be&s;t terms with the mini&s;try<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">James II. 1660.</NOTE>. Every thing fell, &s;ooner than could have been expected, into regularity and form. A general &s;ettlement in the civil ju&s;tice of the kingdom prevailed. No injury was without its remedy; and complaints, more frequent even in the wor&s;t govern|ments than inju&s;tice, were &s;carce ever heard<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Clarendon's life.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings in parlia|ment.</NOTE> The two hou&s;es of parliament proceeded to the &s;et|tlement of the nation. The lords, lately re&s;tored to their function in the &s;tate, &s;eemed &s;en&s;ible of the in|juries, which had deprived them &s;o long of their right. They, however, had not arrived at their for|mer weight and con&s;equence. The Commons, who had given &s;uch recent proofs of their importance, &s;till retained their &s;uperiority. In terms of the King's declaration from Breda, they brought into their hou&s;e a bill of general indemnity, before he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne. They re&s;olved, on the fourteenth of May, to except &s;even of tho&s;e, who &s;at in judgment on the late King, out of the act of oblivion. In their zeal to animadvert upon pa&s;t offences, they even ex|tended puni&s;hment beyond the grave. Serjeant Brad|&s;haw, pre&s;ident of the high court of ju&s;tice, though dead, was attainted for trea&s;on. On the eighth of June they re&s;olved, that the number of twenty, and no more, be&s;ides the King's judges, &s;hould be except|ed, not extending to life. Hutchin&s;on, for his &s;ignal repentance, was left out of the clau&s;e of excep|tion<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">Journals of the hou&s;e of commons.</NOTE>. Colonel Ingold&s;by, for his late &s;ervices, was forgiven and rewarded. The debates, which aro&s;e upon naming the per&s;ons, rendered tedious the

progre&s;s of the bill; and, though the King, in &s;e|veral me&s;&s;ages, expre&s;&s;ed his impatience, the act took &s;ome months in pa&s;&s;ing through both hou&s;es<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">Journals.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act of in|demnity.</NOTE> The debates in the hou&s;e of commons were not the only cau&s;e of the delay which attended the act of in|demnity. The lords, in their zeal for monarchy, and exa&s;perated by former injuries, &s;eemed re&s;olved to ex|cept every per&s;on who had &s;at in judgment on the royal party. The Earl of Bri&s;tol, who had declared him&s;elf a Catholic, &s;ome months before the Re&s;tora|tion<NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">James II. 1660.</NOTE>, was the mo&s;t violent. Though excluded, on account of his religion, from holding a place in the privy-council, he was &s;till tru&s;ted with the &s;ecret of affairs<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">James II. 1663.</NOTE>. Haughty and arrogant, impetuous in his manner, and ambitious in his di&s;po&s;ition, he was determined to direct councils, of which he was not permitted to partake<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">James II. 1660.</NOTE>. To &s;ecure his intere&s;t with the King, he pretended zeal in the royal cau&s;e. He moved in the hou&s;e, that no pardon &s;hould be granted to tho&s;e who had any way contributed to the death of the late King. Bri&s;tol's influence at court was no &s;e|cret. The nation was alarmed at &s;o wide an excep|tion. They began to think that the king, by an artifice, intended to elude his declaration. Charles came to the hou&s;e, and put an end to their fears. He reque&s;ted the lords to extingui&s;h the terrors of the people, to remove their apprehen&s;ions of &s;afety. He de&s;ired them to con&s;ider his promi&s;e, and to exclude none but the re|gicides from the benefit of the act of oblivion. He pre&s;&s;ed them to forget their animo&s;ities, to lay a&s;ide revenge, to drop even the memory of the pa&s;t. He plainly told them, that the peace of the kingdom, if not the very exi&s;tence of monarchy, depended upon expedition in pa&s;&s;ing the bill<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Journals of the lords.</NOTE>.</P>

&s;ince the beginning of the late di&s;turbances, was an object nearly as important as the act of oblivion. All &s;entences in law and equity, &s;ince the fir&s;t of May, 1642, were confirmed by an act of the legi&s;la|ture. Some few re&s;trictions were made, with regard to crown and church lands. The two hou&s;es filled their debates with declarations again&s;t the legality of the procedings of the long parliament, after it had been mutilated by the army. Their zeal might even have led them to re&s;cind all acts of the parliament, which met in the November of the year 1640; but the chancellor &s;hewed no inclination to look back &s;o far. James the Second, in his Memoirs, blames this negligence in Hyde, in terms expre&s;&s;ive of his re&s;ent|ment again&s;t a body of men who had &s;o much injured his family<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">James II. 1660.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Settlement of the reve|nue.</NOTE> In the &s;ettlement of the revenue, the hou&s;e of commons &s;hewed as much regard for the liberties of the &s;ubject, as they had done in their other re&s;olutions for the royal prerogative. It was re&s;olved, before the King's arrival, to aboli&s;h the courts of wards and li|veries<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">Journals, May 25.</NOTE>, as a public grievance; and to make, for that revenue, a compen&s;ation to the crown<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">Journals, Aug. 4.</NOTE>. One hundred thou&s;and pounds was propo&s;ed by the parlia|ment. Double the &s;um had been offered, and, in the reign of James, refu&s;ed for tho&s;e branches of the pre|rogative, together with that of purveyance. This compo&s;ition was charged upon the exci&s;e; one half of which was &s;ettled, in perpetuity, on the crown. The other half of the exci&s;e, and the revenue ari&s;ing from tonnage and poundage, were granted to the King during his life. A committee reported to the hou&s;e, on the fourth of September, that, by an e&s;ti|mate, the King's revenue might be computed at little more than eight hundred thou&s;and pounds. The commons came to re&s;olution to increa&s;e it to twelve hundred thou&s;and pounds. The charging of this re|venue upon adequate funds was a matter of difficulty, and was therefore adjourned to the next meeting of

parliament<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">Speaker's &s;peech, Sept. 4.</NOTE>. An act was, however, pa&s;&s;ed for rai&s;ing one hundred thou&s;and pounds for the King's pre&s;ent &s;upply; which &s;um was to be levied, by way of land-rate, within the &s;pace of one month, to be|gin on the twenty-ninth of September<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Journals, Sept. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Provi&s;ion for di&s;band|ing the ar|my.</NOTE> To di&s;band an army accu&s;tomed to revolution and change, was nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;afety of the nation, and employed the principal attention of parliament. An a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment of &s;eventy thou&s;and pounds, to conti|nue for three months, at fir&s;t voted, was unequal to the purpo&s;e of paying their arrears<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">Journals.</NOTE>. Another act was pa&s;&s;ed, a few days before the adjournment, for an additional a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, to begin on the fir&s;t of November, and to continue for two months. The par|&s;imony of the commons, notwith&s;tanding their profe&s;|&s;ions of unlimited loyalty, was evidently intended to keep the King in a &s;tate of dependence on his parlia|ment. The next hou&s;e of commons, according to James the Second<NOTE N="R" PLACE="foot">James II. 1660.</NOTE>, were le&s;s attentive to the liber|ties of their con&s;tituents. He a&s;cribes their frugality more to, what he calls, the prejudices of Sir Edward Hyde, than to their own patrioti&s;m. In the warmth of their zeal for re&s;tored monarchy, they could deny nothing to their prince. It was propo&s;ed by &s;ome leading members to &s;ettle a very large revenue on the crown<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">2,000,000 l.</NOTE>. The chancellor prevented the motion from being made in the hou&s;e. He was afraid that the King would &s;tand no longer in need of parliament; or, what was &s;till more contrary to his principles, that the Popi&s;h religion might be introduced, as fa|vourable to the authority of the crown. <Q REND="inline">"This over&s;ight, or rather terror in Hyde,"</Q> continues James, <Q REND="inline">"was the &s;ource of the dangers which monarchy has &s;ince undergone.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Honours conferred.</NOTE> Whil&s;t parliament was preparing puni&s;hments for the late King's enemies, Charles was bu&s;y in reward|ing his own friends. Tho&s;e who had adhered the be&s;t to his family, contributed, from that circum&s;tance, the lea&s;t to his re&s;toration; and, therefore, their fidelity was forgot, in their want of power to be of &s;ervice. Be&s;ides, their number was a kind of excu&s;e for an appearance of ingratitude. Though the King was not de&s;titute of genero&s;ity, he was not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the means of exerci&s;ing it, in an exten&s;ive degree. The hereditary property of the crown had been di&s;|&s;ipated in the late troubles; and had even the reve|nue promi&s;ed by parliament been &s;ettled, it was une|qual, without the mo&s;t rigid oeconomy, to carry on the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ervice of the &s;tate. Hereditary honours were the only rewards which Charles could be&s;tow with ea&s;e. Monk, by the title of Duke of Albemarle, took his &s;eat in the hou&s;e of lords<NOTE N="X" PLACE="foot">Journals of the Lords.</NOTE>, on the thir|teenth of July. Admiral Montague was introduced, on the twenty-&s;ixth of the &s;ame month, by the name of Earl of Sandwich.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage of the Duke of York.</NOTE> The joy, which the natural gaiety of Charles derived from his unexpected re&s;toration to the throne of his ance&s;tors, was con&s;iderably checked by acci|dents and misfortunes in his own family. During a vi&s;it, which the Prince&s;s of Orange paid to the Queen mother at Paris, in the year 1657, the Duke of York fell in love with Mrs. Anne Hyde, one of her maids of honour, and daughter to Sir Edward Hyde. The Duke's affection for the daughter began when he was on bad terms with the father; and the latter remained in ab&s;olute ignorance of a circum&s;tance which was &s;carce a &s;ecret in his family<NOTE N="Z" PLACE="foot">James II. 1662.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections on</NOTE> The Iri&s;h nation came down from antiquity, marked with an uncommon &s;ingularity of political misfortunes. Di&s;tracted by dome&s;tic feuds, and labouring under all the mi&s;eries of anarchy, they became, in part, &s;ub|jected to England, before either time or accident had poli&s;hed her own government into preci&s;ion and form. The natural aver&s;ion entertained by natives again&s;t all foreign intruders, combining with the violence and in|ju&s;tice in&s;eparable from conquerors, e&s;tabli&s;hed an en|mity between them, which was augmented by various unfortunate incidents, in the progre&s;s of time. The opinions of the two nations were as different as their manners and intere&s;ts; and they invariably affected, in every thing, to run into the oppo&s;ite extremes. The conver&s;ion of the Engli&s;h to the Reformed reli|gion was &s;ufficient to induce the Iri&s;h to adhere to the old &s;uper&s;ition. A &s;piritual enmity added its rage to temporal animo&s;ity; and if at any time an appearance of tranquility prevailed, it proceeded from the prepa|rations made to en&s;ure revenge. As long as the go|vernment in England retained its force, a kind of a cold and unwilling obedience was paid by Ireland to its
<PB N="23" REF="37">
laws. But when the reins became relaxed, in the hands of Charles the Fir&s;t, the Iri&s;h Catholics carried their aver&s;ion to the Engli&s;h race into acts of unpre|cedented barbarity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">the &s;tate of Ireland.</NOTE> In the cour&s;e of the troubles which followed the ma&s;&s;acre of the Prote&s;tants in Ireland, the inhuma|nity of the Catholics was &s;everely retaliated upon them&s;elves. Under the &s;pecious pretence of revenging the cruelties committed on the Engli&s;h, Cromwell made large &s;trides toward the extirpation of the na|tives. The difficulty of de&s;troying a whole nation, more than motives of pity, induced the conqueror to confine to the half of the province of Connaught and the county of Clare the remnant that had e&s;caped his &s;word. All the Iri&s;h, under pain of death, were ordered to retire within the allotted pale, on a cer|tain day. Di&s;ea&s;e and famine accompanied them to their wretched retreat. But the enemy hovered on their frontier, and prevented their e&s;cape from mi&s;ery. The re&s;t of the i&s;land was left to the Engli&s;h. Some of the old lords and ju&s;t proprietors, being Pro|te&s;tants, were permitted to retain their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. The lands of the Catholics, now bani&s;hed into Con|naught and Clare, were parcelled out among the adventurers and &s;oldiers. The &s;pirits of the Iri&s;h were &s;o entirely broken, that this &s;ummary divi&s;ion of their property was made without exciting a mur|mur. Mi&s;ery had arrived at a pitch beyond complaint, and the &s;en&s;e of injuries &s;eemed to have vani&s;hed with the power of revenge. Ireland remained quiet under the dominion of Cromwell. The enemies of his authority lay &s;ubdued by his violence; and tho&s;e whom he had gratified with the &s;poils of the van|qui&s;hed, being from principle, as well as fear, aver&s;e from monarchy, were determined to adhere to any &s;y&s;tem that might prevent the re&s;toration of the royal family to the throne.</P>

whom both had treated with a coldne&s;s that border|ed on di&s;dain. France, jealous of an ancient enemy, envied to Spain the pro&s;pect of reconquering Portu|gal. Lewis, unwilling to recommence ho&s;tilities again&s;t Philip, hoped to &s;top the progre&s;s of his arms, by rendering Charles a party for the hou&s;e of Bra|ganza. The Portugue&s;e them&s;elves perceived no means of &s;afety, but in the power of the Engli&s;h nation. Swayed by her perilous &s;ituation, and, per|haps, in&s;tigated by France, the Queen-regent of Por|tugal ordered her amba&s;&s;ador at London to propo&s;e a marriage between her daughter and Charles. She offered terms that were likely to gain a prince, in whom his nece&s;&s;ities, and a de&s;ire of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the means of pro&s;ecuting his plea&s;ures, had created a love of money that approached to avarice. The proffered portion was five hundred thou&s;and pounds in money, the ce&s;&s;ion of Tangier and Bombay, with a free trade to the Brazils, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of Portugal in the Ea&s;t-Indies<NOTE N="Z" PLACE="foot">Clarendon's life.</NOTE>.</P>

The nation, though returned to its ancient political principles, was not yet become &s;ufficiently cool from the fervour of religious zeal. Without philo&s;ophy to &s;eparate &s;piri|tual opinions from their temporal concerns, men car|ried re&s;entment and animo&s;ity into debates, which, by a &s;trange perver&s;ion of their &s;ubject, have &s;eldom been managed with common decency. The friends of epi&s;copal hierarchy, though very warm in promoting the bill, were not its only &s;upporters in its progre&s;s through both hou&s;es. The Pre&s;byterians, de&s;tined to di&s;appointments in their views, were oppo&s;ed, by the joint concurrence of other &s;ectaries. The Inde|pendents were their ancient enemies. They had of|fended the republicans, by contributing to the re&s;to|ration of monarchy. The high-flying Royali&s;ts, in whom a zeal for the crown was a kind of religion, forgot not former demerits in their recent &s;ervices. The fir&s;t they con&s;idered as flowing from principle; the latter they attributed more to a change occa&s;ioned by the temper of the times, than to an alteration in their political &s;entiments. The Roman-Catholics to a dread of an union between the Prote&s;tants, added their abhorrence of a &s;y&s;tem of church-government &s;o oppo&s;ite to their own. All parties &s;eemed to concur in ruining the Pre&s;byterians, by a law which the di&s;|pa&s;&s;ionate mu&s;t have deemed &s;evere. The King, in his indifference for religious forms, looked upon the debates in both hou&s;es with &s;eeming unconcern. But
<PB N="39" REF="53">
his attention and ea&s;y acce&s;s to the Pre&s;byterians had rai&s;ed their hopes of an indulgence to a pitch, which a man of more &s;crupulous morals than Charles could &s;carce reconcile to his tacit acquie&s;cence in &s;uch har&s;h mea&s;ures in his parliament.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its &s;everity.</NOTE> Though the &s;cheme of a comprehen&s;ion, adopted by the King in the preceding year, promi&s;ed no &s;uc|ce&s;s, it ought, perhaps, to have &s;ugge&s;ted to the church-party a greater latitude in the terms of their communion. In&s;tead of &s;hewing any inclination to comprehend the Pre&s;byterians, they turned the whole force of the act again&s;t the favourite tenets of that &s;ect. The intere&s;t of individuals &s;eemed, in this in|&s;tance, to combine with a zeal for the ancient rites of the church. Several of the followers of the Pre&s;by|terian &s;y&s;tem were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of livings con&s;iderable in their value; whil&s;t many of the epi&s;copal clergy re|mained in want, for their adherence to their religious principles. The bill of uniformity left no room for eva&s;ion, to the lea&s;t tender con&s;ciences, without the danger of &s;acrificing the character of con&s;i&s;tency to motives of intere&s;t. The act required, that every clergyman, to render him capable of holding a be|nefice, &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s epi&s;copal ordination; &s;hould a&s;&s;ent to every thing contained in the book of Com|mon-prayer; &s;hould take the oath of canonical obe|dience, abjure the covenant, and renounce the taking arms, on any pretence what&s;oever, again&s;t the King. The&s;e conditions were more apt to confirm men in their former opinions, than to bring them within the pale of the church. The political prejudices enter|tained by Clarendon again&s;t the Pre&s;byterians added force, upon this occa&s;ion, to his attachment to the church. Though Charles had been treated with in|dignity in Scotland by the followers of pre&s;bytery, he was as forgetful of injuries as he was of favours; and he &s;eems to have been &s;wayed entirely by his mi|ni&s;ter, in agreeing to an act which infringed his de|claration from Breda. The &s;ubterfuge of regulating the promi&s;ed indulgence by the advice and authority of parliament, &s;uited more with the nice di&s;tinctions of a lawyer, than the comprehen&s;ive ideas of a great &s;tate&s;man.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial of Vane</NOTE> Sir Henry Vane and Colonel Lambert, in pur&s;uance of an addre&s;s of the hou&s;e of commons, were, on the fourth of June, arraigned for high trea&s;on at the bar of the King's Bench<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">Kennet's Regi&s;ter.</NOTE>. The carriage of the pri|&s;oners differed not more from each other, than it was oppo&s;ite to their own known characters. Vane, tho' naturally timid, behaved with a confidence and bold|ne&s;s which bordered on in&s;olence. Lambert, formerly renowned for his courage, was full of a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, which might have been con&s;trued into fear. Vane, though an enthu&s;ia&s;t in religion, was a man of abili|ties in civil affairs. He offered &s;everal matters in arre&s;t of judgment. He defended him&s;elf with arguments more deci&s;ive in theory, than &s;uitable to the ideas of the prevailing powers. The indictment again&s;t him com|prehended none of his actions during the life of the late King; and he ought not, in &s;trict ju&s;tice, he affirmed, to be arraigned for want of fidelity to a Prince, who, tho' <HI>de jure,</HI> was not <HI>de facto</HI> King. A &s;overeign, he urged, who cannot defend from injuries, has no right to puni&s;h his &s;ubjects for di&s;obedience; allegiance and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion being the price of protection, and not the inherent property of the chief magi&s;trate. If com|pliance with the government of a commonwealth was a crime, it was, he added, only common to him with the nation; and he knew not, in that latitude of guilt, who was innocent enough to condemn him for trea&s;on. He denied his being acce&s;&s;ary to the death the late King. He mentioned as a merit, that he op|po&s;ed the violence and tyranny of Cromwell<NOTE N="R" PLACE="foot">Trial printed by his friends</NOTE>. He in&s;i&s;ted, that as the two hou&s;es of parliament had joined in a petition for his life, to which the King agreed, this concurrence of the legi&s;lative power had the &s;orce of an act of parliament.

The fir&s;t, however, was re|prieved at the bar, and confined for life to the i&s;land of Guern&s;ey, where he continued in ob&s;cure tranqui|lity above thirty years. A principle of ambition, more than any aver&s;ion to monarchy, was the &s;ource of Lambert's activity in the late troubles. He had intended, when he e&s;caped from the tower, in the be|ginning of April 1660, to have declared for the King, and to have precluded Monk from the rewards which he derived from the re&s;toration of monarchy<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">Kennet.</NOTE>. He lived a concealed Papi&s;t<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>, and he died in the Ro|mi&s;h communion. Vane's pre&s;umptuous behaviour at his trial was the cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned for his execution. The blood of the Earl of Strafford &s;eems, however, to have been required at his hands. The virulence and activity with which he per&s;ecuted that unfortunate nobleman, rendered his own fate le&s;s regretted. His enthu&s;ia&s;m &s;upplied, in his latter moments, his want of natural courage, and he &s;uffered with a firmne&s;s which argued that he acted from principle. When he at|tempted to &s;peak to the people, his voice was drowned with the noi&s;e of trumpets and drums<NOTE N="Y" PLACE="foot">Trial.</NOTE>; a mean piece of policy, which did more harm than ought to have been dreaded from the &s;peech of Vane.</P>

The abettors of the act affirmed, that it was unju&s;t that men, who believed not the doctrines of the church, &s;hould enjoy its revenues. The oppo&s;ers of the law in&s;i&s;ted, that orthodoxy of faith depended not upon forms. The fir&s;t &s;aid, that the conference at the Savoy had &s;hewn the di&s;po&s;ition of the Di&s;&s;enters to quarrel. The latter replied, that the violence of the churchmen promoted &s;chi&s;ms, by forcing men of tender con&s;ciences to &s;et up &s;eparate congregations. The one &s;ide &s;hewed the nece&s;&s;ity of an union of opinions. The other declared an union of charity to be &s;ufficient. The church &s;poke of the covenant, as the &s;eed of rebellions. The Pre&s;byte|rians urged, that it &s;ecured the ju&s;t rights of the &s;o|vereign, as well as the religious privileges of the &s;ub|ject. The fir&s;t in&s;i&s;ted, that the Di&s;&s;enters were in|truders upon the livings of the church. The latter derived an argument, favourable to them&s;elves, from their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing tho&s;e livings for many years. Both had their rea&s;ons, but neither party was free from prejudice. Ancient injuries contributed more to their di&s;union, than pre&s;ent differences in doctrine.

The charge of maintaining it was very con&s;iderable, and the profit ari&s;ing from it extremely &s;mall. It had no port to re|ceive ve&s;&s;els of burden; no harbour where &s;hips of war could ride with &s;afety. Weak to the land, and ea&s;ily blocked up by &s;ea, it would be difficult to main|tain it, but it might be commanded with ea&s;e.

The two hundred thou&s;and crowns received, in the beginning of the year, from France to &s;upport Portugal, were already expended upon the forces &s;ent, in the month of June, to the latter kingdom. His &s;i&s;ter had been married near eighteen months to the Duke of Orleans, and her portion was not hitherto paid. The&s;e were the urgent rea&s;ons which weighed with Charles. The relief was trifling, and the lo&s;s of reputation, which aro&s;e from the mea&s;ure, great. But he was a &s;pend|thrift in politics, as well as in money.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Quarrels at court</NOTE> During tran&s;actions in which the public were con|cerned, the private happine&s;s of Charles was di&s;turbed by dome&s;tic di&s;tractions, which proceeded from his own vices and weakne&s;&s;es. Given to women and ad|dicted to debauchery, he was either the dupe of de|&s;igning mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, or converted into a tool by profli|gate men. Through a kind of vicious gratitude, he could refu&s;e no favour to the fir&s;t. He was governed by the latter through the ea&s;ine&s;s of a lively temper, that &s;acrificed every thing to mirth. Though a man of abilities, he hated bu&s;ine&s;s, becau&s;e it interfered with his amu&s;ements. He followed &s;en&s;uality with an avidity which is apt to de&s;troy plea&s;ure, by enjoying it beyond mea&s;ure. De&s;titute of religion, he dropt its appearance; and by a&s;&s;ociating with the di&s;&s;olute, he became an example and encourager of debauchery and vice. His good &s;en&s;e and under&s;tanding yielded the reins to a thoughtle&s;s extravagance. His virtues, for he had &s;ome, came &s;eldom in view, as he bani&s;hed morality from trifles. The Queen, in&s;tead of re|claiming him from his immoderate love of women, fixed him for ever in his infidelity, by her peevi&s;hne&s;s. His mini&s;ter, though a man of abilities and virtue, was har&s;h and &s;evere in his di&s;po&s;ition, and more apt to irritate than per&s;uade a prince, who&s;e happine&s;s chiefly con&s;i&s;ted in good-humour and indolence.

When the Queen refu&s;ed this reque&s;t, with the indignation natural to a woman who&s;e per&s;on is de&s;pi&s;ed, Clarendon was employed to &s;oothe her into con&s;ent; an office more agreeable to his love of his ma&s;ter's repo&s;e, than &s;uitable to the dignity of his &s;tation and character.

Though Clarendon, per|haps, regretted that his old friend Nicholas &s;hould retire, there is rea&s;on to believe he was not very aver&s;e to Bennet's promotion. Jealous of the influ|ence of Sir Charles Berkley with the King, he &s;up|ported Bennet again&s;t him, upon his return from Spain; and, after Bennet had accepted the &s;eals, he paid an attention to the chancellor which bore the appearance of gratitude.

The coldne&s;s which aro&s;e between them, from Bennet's attention to the favourite mi&s;tre&s;s, was gradually improved into a mu|tual aver&s;ion.

Lewis, to whom ambition was the be&s;t rea&s;on for violence, alledged the Duke's negligence in adhering to the treaty of Montmartre, as the ground of his inva&s;ion. Mar&s;al was inve&s;ted by the armies of France. The Duke, unable to combat with &s;uch odds, &s;igned a treaty at Nomeni, on the fir&s;t of September 1663, by which he yielded Mar&s;al to the King, in return for the re&s;t of his dominions, which were, on that condition, re&s;tored. The inju&s;tice of Lewis to his more feeble neighbours had not yet rai&s;ed the jea|lou&s;y of tho&s;e &s;tates who alone could put bounds to his ambition. The negotiations of the two preceding years di&s;covered to him, that a well-timed &s;upply to Charles would prevent all ob&s;tacles to his de&s;igns from England; and the Dutch, &s;plit even then into two great factions at home, &s;uffered them&s;elves to be &s;wayed from the apparent intere&s;ts of their nation abroad, by their dome&s;tic feuds. The German branch of the fa|mily of Au&s;tria &s;uffered in their importance from the fall of the power of Spain, as well as from internal cau&s;es, co-operating with the undeci&s;ive councils of the Emperor Leopold. The idea of a balance of pow|er, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted during the greatne&s;s of Spain, and which afterwards ro&s;e upon the ambition of Lewis, was &s;carce at this time, an object of policy; and the experience of almo&s;t an age ought to convince Europe, that &s;he honoured France too much, in being afraid of her arms. Lewis him&s;elf had hitherto given no great cau&s;e of jealou&s;y. In deference to the peaceable policy of Mazarin, he had, till the death of that mini&s;ter, carefully concealed the love of glory, to which he after|wards &s;acrificed prudence as well as ju&s;tice.</P>

The earl of Middleton, through the intrigues of Lauderdale, gave place as commi&s;&s;ioner to the Earl of Rothes. On the eighteenth of June, the parliament met at Edinburgh. They condemned to death Arch. John&s;ton, commonly called Laird of Wari&s;ton, who had been very active during the late times, and was the only Scot&s;man who was a member of the famous committee of &s;afety. He was executed at the cro&s;s of Edinburgh on the twenty-&s;econd of July; behaving with more &s;pirit than was expected, from the known timidity of his mind. A national &s;ynod of a peculiar kind was con&s;tituted for the regulation of eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs. It formed a medium between the Pre&s;byterian a&s;&s;embly of the church and the Engli&s;h convocation.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Duke of York com|mands the fleet.</NOTE> The King, encouraged by an ample &s;upply, re&s;olv|ed to pro&s;ecute the war with vigour. The Duke of York, on the fifteenth of March, repaired to Gun|fleet, the general rendezvous of the &s;hips, to ha&s;ten the equipment of the fleet; but it was not in five weeks ready to put to &s;ea. The Duke, to whom &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s was amu&s;ement, employed the time in &s;ettling the order of battle and rank of the commanders. Though the Engli&s;h had been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful at &s;ea under Cromwell, they fought without order, and owed their victories more to their valour than to their &s;kill. The Duke was the fir&s;t who drew up the fleet in a line. In the fir&s;t week of May, he &s;ailed in the Royal Charles, at the head of ninety-eight &s;hips of war, the greate&s;t fleet ever &s;ent by England to &s;ea. He de|termined to vi&s;it the Dutch on their coa&s;t, and an|chored at the mouth of the Texel. The enemy, afraid of a landing, erected beacons along the coa&s;t; but the Duke was forced, by &s;tre&s;s of weather, to re|turn to Gunfleet to refit. On the thirtieth of May, as the wind, being ea&s;terly, might bring the Dutch on the Engli&s;h coa&s;t, he &s;ailed, making all the u&s;e he could of the tide; yet it was the fir&s;t of June before he could anchor in Southwold Bay. About one o'clock, the Dutch fleet, under Opdam, appeared to windward, con&s;i&s;ting of one hundred and thirteen men of war, eleven fire-&s;hips, and &s;even yachts. The wind, which continued ea&s;terly, fell towards evening; &s;o that, though both fleets u&s;ed all their &s;ails, little way could be made<NOTE N="R" PLACE="foot">James II. 1665.</NOTE>.</P>

He ordered the &s;ignal to be given for the whole fleet to tack; but the &s;ailor &s;ent up the ma&s;t was &s;o long in unfurling the flag, that, before he could let it fly, Opdam with his van had bore up round, &s;hip after &s;hip, and brought his &s;tarboard tacks on board.

The Earl of Falmouth, the Lord Mu&s;kerry, and Mr. Boyle, as they &s;tood on the quarter-deck, were all &s;lain by one &s;hot; and the Duke, who &s;tood by their &s;ide, was covered with their blood.

When it began to grow dark, the Duke ordered the Norwich, a fifth-rate, to keep ju&s;t a-head of him all night, to hang out lights, and to keep clo&s;e to the Dutch. He ordered Captain Wetwang, who commanded her, to fire guns, to make fal&s;e fires, to put out more lights, &s;hould the enemy clear their cour&s;e; and by no means to lo&s;e them in the night. Having given &s;trict charge to his own &s;hip to keep clo&s;e to the enemy, that he might engage them by break of day, he retired to his cabin about eleven o'clock, and lay down on a quilt, in his clothes, to take &s;ome re&s;t, after the fatigues of the day.

He thought that the Royal Charles had, by being a good &s;ailer ad|vanced a-head of the other &s;hips. This accident &s;aved the Dutch. They endeavoured to enter the Texel, but the tide had failed.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affair of Bergen.</NOTE> Frederick the Third, who then &s;at with &s;ome repu|tation on the throne of Denmark, acted, upon this occa&s;ion, a part unworthy of a King.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Third day.</NOTE> Albemarle found his fleet &s;o much weakened in this action, that he re&s;olved to take the benefit of the night and retire.

Albemarle prepared to renew the action, and re&s;olved to peri&s;h rather than yield.

They crowded toward them with all their &s;ails.&mdash;The Dutch lay with their &s;ails to the ma&s;t. The fight began about eight of the clock, with the ut|mo&s;t fury on both &s;ides. The Dutch were eager to retain their advantage, the Engli&s;h to retrieve their fame. The victory remained doubtful throughout the day. De Ruyter exerted all his &s;kill, but the two admirals were invincible. They kept their fir&s;t ad|vantage of the wind. They burnt &s;ix &s;hips, they &s;unk others, and lo&s;t only three. The fate of the battle was not, however, decided at &s;ix at night; when both, as if weary of carnage, gradually &s;epa|rated, and ha&s;tened to their re&s;pective coa&s;ts. Both &s;ides claimed the victory; both de&s;erved it, had it depended on valour. Albemarle, by his invincible courage, made amends for his eagerne&s;s; and Rupert, by the timely relief which he brought to his di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed friends, added their love to his former renown. The behaviour of the Dutch admirals upon this oc|ca&s;ion was manly, and full of heroi&s;m. De Ruyter and Van Tromp, though mortal enemies a&s;hore, contended at &s;ea only for fame.

of July before they came in &s;ight of the enemy. De Ruyter, reinforced by &s;ome &s;hips that were ready to &s;ail for the Baltic, was before them at the mouth of the Thames. When the Engli&s;h appeared, he retreated toward the coa&s;t of Holland; but he was clo&s;ely pur&s;ued. Night prevented an ac|tion. About &s;ix the next morning, the Engli&s;h found them&s;elves within two leagues of the enemy. The Dutch formed them&s;elves into a half moon, to avoid the fire-&s;hips, the Engli&s;h having the wind. They hoped, in that way, that either their van or rear, by tacking, might weather a part of the Engli&s;h fleet. At ten the white &s;quadron fell along-&s;ide of the Dutch, and the fire began. The enemy, at eleven, gave way a little, but they renewed the action; yet, at one, their whole van gave way, and bore up be|fore the wind. De Ruyter's &s;hip &s;till maintained the fight again&s;t the Engli&s;h admirals. The Royal Charles, on board of which were the Prince and Duke, was forced to quit the line at three to refit, and the Sovereign fell in her place, along-&s;ide of De Ruyter. His fire-&s;hip being at length &s;unk, and his main-top-ma&s;t &s;hot down, he bore, at four, into his fleet, right before the wind. He di&s;abled his ad|ver&s;ary in &s;uch a manner as prevented pur&s;uit. Van Tromp having, at the beginning of the action, broke in between the red and the blue, maintained, with his wonted ob&s;tinacy, the battle with the latter &s;qua|dron. He al&s;o was at length forced to give way. Though the lo&s;s of the Dutch was not con&s;iderable, an indi&s;puted victory remained to the Engli&s;h. They rode in triumph along the coa&s;t. They attacked the i&s;le of Ulie. They burnt two men of war, and one hundred and &s;ixty merchant-men, that lay in the harbour<NOTE N="X" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pepys's MSS. &s;ol. 58. Oxon.</NOTE>.</P>

On the &s;econd of Sep|tember a fire broke out, at one in the morning, in a baker's &s;hop in Pudding-lane, near New Fi&s;h-&s;treet, with &s;uch violence, that the family e&s;caped with the greate&s;t difficulty. The wind was high, the lane nar|row, the hou&s;es were old and of wood. The flakes, carried forward by the tempe&s;t, kindled new fires beyond the cour&s;e of the fir&s;t flame, and &s;pread the deva&s;tation far and wide. The terror of the peo|ple was at la&s;t equal to their danger, though great. Uproar, confu&s;ion, and flight, prevailed. Few thought of &s;aving any thing, except their lives; none to &s;top the progre&s;s of the conflagration. The morning came, and the fire increa&s;ed. The alarm had &s;pread to the farthe&s;t corners of the city; a&s;&s;i&s;tance came from all parts. The pipes under the &s;treets were broken up; but, to add to the mi&s;chief, the water &s;uddenly fail|ed. That part of the city where the flames raged was &s;upplied with water by the engine at the north|end of the bridge; but the engine it&s;elf was burnt down.

The King, the Duke, the of|ficers of &s;tate, the members of the privy-council, took different po&s;ts in the city, to keep order, by their authority, among the terrified populace; and to con|tribute, by their directions, to furni&s;h them with re|lief.

Rouzed from his lethargy of plea&s;ure and indolence, he was pre&s;ent every where, directing, encouraging, a&s;&s;i&s;ting tho&s;e who laboured to extingui&s;h the fire. The Duke of York, who was afterwards accu&s;ed as the author of the calamity, was active in &s;topping its progre&s;s. The wind falling in the night of Tue&s;day, the flames began to decline. The fire, by the blowing up of hou&s;es, cea&s;ed in many parts; in others it became extingui&s;hed, with|out any apparent cau&s;e. On the evening of Wed|ne&s;day it broke out a fre&s;h in the Inner-Temple; but, by the care of the Duke of York, who held the watch there for that night, it was extingui&s;hed before day.

The minds of men were not yet &s;ettled, from the late diver&s;ity of political opinions. The negligence of a di&s;&s;olute court, the carele&s;s and even profligate character of the King, were more apt to kindle ancient jealou&s;ies, than to lull the people into pre&s;ent &s;ecurity. The novelty of the re&s;toration of monarchy, the &s;pecious qualities of the Prince, had lo&s;t a great deal of their influence in the progre&s;s of time; and mankind, as if awakened from a dream, began to wonder how they had been plea&s;ed.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">in parlia|ment.</NOTE> The ill-humour in parliament proceeded le&s;s from a regard for the public good, than from the private views of &s;ome leading members.

Men &s;aw that the road to preferment lay through that place; and they began to oppo&s;e the crown, to render them&s;elves nece&s;&s;ary to its &s;ervice. This &s;cience, brought &s;ince to great perfection, was far from being unknown under Charles. The be&s;t &s;peakers among the commons thought them&s;elves the mo&s;t able to govern the nation. They formed into a party, and, to carry forward their operations with more force they cho&s;e a head. This was the Duke of Buckingham, who joined lively parts to unequal|led profligacy. The plea&s;antne&s;s of his humour and conver&s;ation, the extravagance and poignancy of his wit, rendered per&s;ons of all opinions fond of his com|pany.

The&s;e precau|tions were, however, unnece&s;&s;ary. The difficult na|vigation of the Thames, prevented De Ruyter from endeavouring to advance, more than any force pre|pared by the Engli&s;h. He &s;ailed we&s;tward along the coa&s;t. He attempted Port&s;mouth, Torbay and Ply|mouth in vain. He returned again to the Thames. The &s;ame con&s;ternation was renewed. An encoun|ter happened between Sir Edward Spragge and the enemy, in the mouth of the river. Little damage was done on either &s;ide. Spragge retired to Grave&s;|end, De Ruyter &s;ailed again to the we&s;t. The Dutch, during the whole month of June and the greate&s;t part of July, rode triumphant in the channel. The treaty of peace being at length &s;igned, on the twenty-fir&s;t of the latter month, De Ruyter put an end to ho&s;tilities and returned to Holland. Charles was ex|tremely mortified at the di&s;grace, which either his own avarice, or the un&s;kilfulne&s;s of his councils brought upon the nation.

Thus ended the fir&s;t war of Charles, begun through jealou&s;y more than injury; and which, though carried on with &s;ome glory, terminated in di&s;grace. Though the Dutch were nominally joined by two crowned heads, they derived little a&s;&s;i&s;tance from either. They were &s;upported merely by their own re&s;ources, and the en|terprizing genius of their mini&s;ter, De Wit. A &s;ub&s;idy procured for them the friend&s;hip of Denmark; they owed the name of France, in the war, to the influence of the pen&s;ionary with Lewis the Fourteenth. Neither of the two kings had any quarrel with England; and they had no differences to &s;ettle by treaty. To forget the pa&s;t was to be reconciled with Denmark; and France, by putting a part of the i&s;land of St. Chri&s;to|pher's again in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h, removed every pretence of future conte&s;t. The ambition of Lewis being turned to another quarter, he found it convenient to &s;ecure the acquie&s;cence, if not the friend&s;hip of Charles.

To the&s;e, Charles had only to oppo&s;e &s;ome amiable qualities; and that irre&s;i&s;tible popularity in his manner, which &s;up|ported him with the vulgar, in his wor&s;t mea&s;ures. Men of &s;en&s;e and virtue, who knew his abilities, were offended at his not exerting them with vigour.

The calamities of fire, pe&s;tilence, and, in the end, an inglorious war, were not capable to alienate the affec|tions of the people from a prince, who&s;e very vices were popular.

He perceived, that to regain the confidence of the nation, he mu&s;t a&s;&s;ume an appear|ance of changing his mea&s;ures. He knew that a &s;acri|fice mu&s;t be made, and that a mini&s;ter is the mo&s;t grateful offering to an offended people. The Earl of Clarendon, though he had lo&s;t a part of the confidence of the Sovereign, was con&s;idered by the nation, as the leader in all his councils; and he was now become as di&s;agreeable to Charles, as he was hated by his &s;ubjects. This noble per&s;on, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of merit, was &s;ub|ject to weakne&s;&s;es, which by their magnitude bordered upon vices. To the &s;everity of his manners he added a pa&s;&s;ionate di&s;po&s;ition, which frequently converted his be&s;t friends into his wor&s;t enemies. In bu&s;ine&s;s he was &s;ometimes trifling, always dilatory<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">North's Examen, p. 455.</NOTE>; and he often forgot to act, in the plea&s;ure which he derived from di&s;qui&s;ition and argument.

His good &s;en&s;e yielded too often to the vehemence of his temper; and, as he was &s;eldom wrong in his judgment, he could not bear contradiction with any degree of pa|tience.

The whole weight of the &s;tate lay chiefly on his &s;houlders; and an old &s;ervant derived a kind of right to be familiar, from his fidelity.

The power of being u&s;eful being ended with the chancellor, the King cea&s;ed to be grateful. In falling down with the &s;tream of public opinion, he found that he could in|dulge his own private re&s;entment. The enemies of Clarendon, and envy as well as his manner had rai&s;ed many again&s;t him, urged the King to remove him, with all their addre&s;s. The Duke of Buckingham, who had, &s;ome months before, fallen under the di&s;plea&s;ure of Charles, was now permitted to appear at court; and he a&s;cribed his late misfortunes to the chancellor. With all the force of his poignant wit, he had long endeavoured to render the mini&s;ter ridiculous in the eyes of his Sovereign; and what contributed &s;till more to the &s;ucce&s;s of his purpo&s;e, he promi&s;ed for the fu|ture good humour of the commons, &s;hould his enemy be dive&s;ted of his employment.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Death and character.</NOTE> On the third of January 1670, after a lingering illne&s;s, George Monk, Duke of Albemarle, died, in the &s;ixty-fir&s;t year of his age<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Skinner's Monk.</NOTE>. This extraordi|nary per&s;on has been variou&s;ly repre&s;ented by writ|ers; a circum&s;tance not &s;urprizing, in a country where character is too often mea&s;ured by the &s;tand|ard of political prejudice. His claim to per&s;onal courage, to military &s;kill, to prudence in his mea|&s;ures and moderation in his views, is by no party denied; though it &s;hall always be que&s;tioned, whe|ther he owed &s;o much to his abilities as to fortune.

The machine of government, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, becomes &s;o &s;imple, that it may be conducted by any hand. The &s;ituation of Monk was, however, more delicate than that of many others, who&s;e fortune it was to command na|tions by the terrors of the &s;word. When he march|ed from Scotland with &s;ix thou&s;and men, more than forty thou&s;and veterans were in the hands of his ene|mies in England. But his coolne&s;s and deliberation, were more than a match for the undeci&s;ive enthu|&s;ia&s;m of Fleetwood; and he derived from his ju&s;tice and influence with the &s;oldiers, what the more &s;plen|did abilities of Lambert could never command.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">of the Duke of Albe|marle.</NOTE> The high &s;ituation which enabled Monk to re-e&s;tabli&s;h monarchy, was a di&s;advantage to his cha|racter, after the Re&s;toration.

to put the wor&s;t con&s;tructions upon a deportment &s;o different from their own. His taciturnity was no longer a&s;cribed to prudence, his frugality was di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the name of avarice, his di&s;regard to ce|remony denominated clowni&s;hne&s;s. The King, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, never deviated from tho&s;e marks of re&s;pect, which he owed to him for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his throne. The Duke was admitted always to his mo&s;t &s;ecret councils. Recour&s;e was had to his prudence in dome&s;tic tumults, to his valour in fo|reign war.

The &s;ecret negotiation employed the attention of the Popi&s;h junto throughout the year 1669. The eagerne&s;s of Charles to receive two hundred thou|&s;and pounds, as the price of his conver&s;ion was coun|teracted by that of Lewis to begin with the Dutch war. Notwith&s;tanding the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the latter, he &s;ubmitted it, upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, to his policy. He believed Charles to be &s;incere, at the time that he him&s;elf was the dupe of his avarice. He thought that a precipitate declaration of his re|ligion would fill his hands with too much bu&s;ine&s;s at home, to be in a condition to aid his ally abroad. But Charles was ob&s;tinate. The money for his con|ver&s;ion was to be received before his declaration for Popery, and he endeavoured to conceal the impa|tience of his nece&s;&s;ities under a zeal for the Romi&s;h faith. To put an end to the procra&s;tinations of Lewis, Charles played off another engine on his weakne&s;s. He in&s;tructed his re&s;ident at the Hague to ha&s;ten the acce&s;&s;ion of the Emperor and Spain to the triple alliance. De Pomponne, the amba&s;&s;ador of France to the States, informed his ma&s;ter of the conclu&s;ion of this formidable alliance. Lewis was alarmed.

In the mean time, Charles, to keep &s;ecret his agreement with France, &s;uffered Buckingham, and his own &s;i&s;ter the Duche&s;s of Orleans, who were ab&s;olute &s;trangers to the agree|ment already &s;igned, to carry on a mock treaty; while, at the &s;ame time, he kept this mock treaty a &s;ecret from the Duke of York and the Earl of Arlington<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">James II. 1669.</NOTE>.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Treaty con|cluded.</NOTE> On the fir&s;t of June, the mock treaty, the &s;ame in &s;ub&s;tance with that already concluded, except in the article of the King's religion, was &s;igned at Dover. It had been &s;tipulated in the fir&s;t treaty, that Charles, to &s;upport him&s;elf in his declaration for Popery, &s;hould receive two hundred thou&s;and pounds from the King of France: one half to be paid three months from the ratification of the treaty, and the other three months after the expiration of that time. In the pre&s;ent treaty, the triple alliance, in &s;o far as it concerned the in|forcement of the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, was to remain inviolable. But, in ca&s;e the King of Spain &s;hould die without i&s;&s;ue, his dominions were to be divided between the contracting powers. Minorca, O&s;tend, and all Spani&s;h America, were to fall to the lot of Charles. All the territories of Spain in Europe were to be a&s;&s;igned to Lewis. To facilitate the com|pletion of this grand object of the treaty, war was to be declared again&s;t the Dutch; and their dominions, after a provi&s;ion made for the Prince of Orange, were to be ceded to France; except the i&s;lands Walkeron, L'Eclu&s;e, and Ca&s;&s;ante, together with all the ports to Mae&s;land-Sluys, re&s;erved for the King of England<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">James II. 1670.</NOTE>. To enable Charles to exert his force with vigour, a &s;ub&s;idy of eight hundred thou&s;and pounds was to be annually paid by France, during this eventual war. In the ca&s;e of the decea&s;e of the King of Spain, both the contracting powers were to join, at their own proper expence, to &s;ubject his American dominions to Eng|land; but Charles was to receive three pounds twelve &s;hillings a-month for each man to be employed by &s;ea in reducing the Spani&s;h territories in Europe under the dominion of the French King.<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">Vid.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections.</NOTE> Such was the treaty with France. The conditions, though known to many individuals, remained long a &s;ecret from the public.

the government of England been as de&s;potic in its con+&s;titution as that of France, it would be difficult to ac+cu&s;e the King of having neglected the intere&s;ts of his &s;ubjects. By annihilating the trade of Holland with its independence, England, from its peculiar advantages, might be &s;uppo&s;ed to command the commerce of Eu|rope; whil&s;t the wealth of America would provide it with re&s;ources, which might for ever defeat the de&s;igns of France again&s;t its power. But commerce is neither to be acquired by violence, nor kept by force; and the danger of American trea&s;ures had been even then a&s;certained, by their effect on Spain. In the mo&s;t flat|tering light, the object of this treaty would prove, in the end, of no real advantage to the Engli&s;h nation; and it would, in the mean time, mo&s;t certainly deprive them of their political freedom. The independence on parliament, which the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of trea&s;ure might have given to the King, mu&s;t have rendered the mo|narchy ab&s;olute; an abject &s;y&s;tem of government un|der any &s;overeign, but in&s;upportable under a carele&s;s and di&s;&s;olute prince. The King, however, extended not his principal views &s;o far. Too indolent in his character, and unper&s;evering in his di&s;po&s;ition, pre&s;ent relief from his di&s;tre&s;&s;es was with him a greater object than future advantage. Though the King of Spain was &s;ickly, he might live many years; and Charles, by recent experience, had been convinced, that to re|duce the Dutch would at lea&s;t be a ta&s;k of difficulty.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><MILESTONE N="1670" UNIT="year"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections.</NOTE> IN England, the mea&s;ures of the crown are &s;o uni|formly a&s;cribed to its &s;ervants, that the monarch frequently remains, without either cen&s;ure or applau&s;e, at the head of the &s;tate. The mini&s;ter is thought to ad|vi&s;e what he executes, and he only is the object of pu|ni&s;hment, or the &s;ubject of prai&s;e. Charles, though he can derive little reputation from that circum&s;tance, was now the author of his own mea&s;ures; and he cho&s;e his &s;ervants, from their boldne&s;s to act, more than from their wi&s;dom to plan. In the cour&s;e of a &s;ecret
<PB N="123" REF="141">
negotiation of three years, he di&s;covered abilities wor|thy of a more noble object; yet he, at the &s;ame time, betrayed a want of principle, which would di&s;grace the mo&s;t &s;plendid de&s;igns. To deceive his allies, to dupe foreign powers, to &s;hew a contempt for the faith of treaties, may derive &s;ome defence from great examples; but to adopt &s;chemes too pernicious to be wholly laid open to &s;uch bold and profligate &s;ervants as he had cho&s;en, was peculiar to this King. This prince &s;eems to have carried the vein of humour, which di&s;tingui&s;h|ed his private conver&s;ation, into his public tran&s;actions. In a contempt for the abilities of others, he delighted to u&s;e mankind as tools; and derive amu&s;ement, as well as advantage, from follies occa&s;ioned by his own want of &s;incerity. His de&s;ire of money was not, per|haps, more gratified with the &s;ums which he received from Lewis the Fourteenth, than his ta&s;te for humour was &s;atisfied at &s;eeing that monarch becoming a kind of pander to his plea&s;ures.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of the cabal.</NOTE> To carry into execution the &s;ecret treaty with France, Charles &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of employing more tools than tho&s;e by whom it had been &s;igned. Clifford and Arlington, though men of con&s;iderable parts, were not of them&s;elves &s;ufficient to carry forward &s;uch un|popular mea&s;ures. Three others, of more boldne&s;s and &s;uperior profligacy, were admitted with them into the management of the great line of affairs. The&s;e were Buckingham, A&s;hley, and Lauderdale. This commit|tee of five were, by a puerile conceit, denominated the cabal, from the initials of their names; an appellation rendered odious to po&s;terity by their mea&s;ures. Hone&s;t in an uncommon way, they &s;carce, except Arlington, made any preten&s;ions to principle; and this &s;ingularity in him proceeded le&s;s from virtue, than an inherent timidity of mind. The mo&s;t of them had lo&s;t their regard to reputation, in their in&s;atiable de&s;ires and an high opinion of their own abilities; being per&s;uaded, that parts alone are &s;ufficient to &s;upport the character of a mini&s;try with the world.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Clifford.</NOTE> Clifford, whom his name has placed at the head of the cabal, de&s;erved that pre-eminence from another cau&s;e. To a boldne&s;s, which &s;hrunk from no political
<PB N="124" REF="142">
danger, he added an openne&s;s which approached to hone&s;ty. He was a violent enemy, yet a &s;incere friend<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">James II. 1667.</NOTE>; and though his prejudices led him into errors, he atoned for them, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, by avow|ing his conduct to the world. His eloquence in the hou&s;e of commons brought him into notice; his in|timacy with Arlington rai&s;ed him fir&s;t into office<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Ibid, 1668.</NOTE>. Ardent and impetuous in his councils, he de&s;erved to be tru&s;ted from his &s;pirit. His per&s;everance in any plan acquired to him a firmne&s;s in all. The only &s;ymptom of weakne&s;s which he exhibited, was his avowed adherence to a &s;y&s;tem of faith which the laws of his country did not recognize. But few men had then arrived at a degree of philo&s;ophy &s;ufficient to re|move religion from the channel of their temporal con|cerns.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arlington.</NOTE> Arlington &s;upplied the place of exten&s;ive talents by an artful management of &s;uch as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Accom|modating in his principles, and ea&s;y in his addre&s;s, he plea&s;ed when he was known to deceive; and his man|ner acquired to him a kind of influence, where he com|manded no re&s;pect. He was little calculated for bold mea&s;ures, on account of his natural timidity; and that defect created an opinion of his moderation, that was a&s;cribed to virtue. His facility to adopt new mea&s;ures was forgotten in his readine&s;s to acknowledge the er|rors of the old. The deficiency in his integrity was forgiven in the decency of his di&s;hone&s;ty. Too weak not to be &s;uper&s;titious, yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing too much &s;en&s;e to own his adherence to the church of Rome, he lived a Prote&s;tant, in his outward profe&s;&s;ion; but he died a Ca|tholic. Timidity was the chief characteri&s;tic of his mind; and that being known, he was even commanded by cowards<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">James II. 1668.</NOTE>. He was the man of the lea&s;t genius of the whole party; but he had mo&s;t experience in that &s;low and con&s;tant current of bu&s;ine&s;s, which, perhaps, &s;uits affairs of &s;tate better than the violent exertions of men of great parts.</P>

Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an ample e&s;tate, yet always in di&s;tre&s;s. A &s;pendthrift without magnificence, extravagant with|out the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of genero&s;ity. A man of un|common talents, yet &s;ubject to unaccountable weak|ne&s;&s;es. Super&s;titious in his di&s;po&s;ition, yet believing in no religion. Lively in his wit without elegance, open and free without &s;incerity; de&s;titute of principle, and a &s;tranger to prudence. He was vain, but not proud; eager for reputation, but carele&s;s of honour; fond of debauchery, more than a lover of plea&s;ure. He was ver&s;atile and various, &s;ubject to caprice and the &s;lave of whim. In any other age or reign he might offend with the irregularity of his private life; but he never could have an opportunity of giving di&s;gu&s;t by his in|fluence in public affairs. The King, with whom he had been brought up, had a kind of natural affection for him, till he abu&s;ed it by frequent repetitions of acts of in&s;olence and folly. At the re&s;toration, he was the only per&s;on who had enjoyed that honour abroad, excluded from the council<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Ibid 1669.</NOTE>; and he owed afterwards the countenance of Charles to the irre&s;i&s;tible vivacity of his conver&s;ation, and not to any opinion he enter|tained of his merit<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The influence which he ac|quired, immediately after his di&s;grace in 1667, was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">oon lo&s;t.

intrepid in his councils, yet full of addre&s;s in his man|ner, he could execute with confidence, whatever he had planned with art. Naturally re&s;tle&s;s in his temper, he loved trouble, from its amu&s;ement; and though ambi|tious, he was fond of confu&s;ion, more as a field for action, than as the means of acquiring power. His knowledge of human nature was exten&s;ive. He was acquainted with the tempers of men, and commanded them through the channel of their ruling pa&s;&s;ions. Without the reputation of con&s;tancy, he gained the confidence of parties, through their opinion of his ta|lents; and though he de&s;erted mea&s;ures frequently, he never betrayed his friends. He was an eloquent &s;peak|er<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">Ibid, 1681.</NOTE>; but more &s;ubtle in his argument, than &s;olid in his judgment; indefatigable in bu&s;ine&s;s, but ver&s;atile and changeable in his &s;chemes. Mea&s;uring the rules of policy, by his own variable pa&s;&s;ions, he was attached to no political principle, to no particular &s;y&s;tem of go|vernment. Now a republican, now all for monarchy; to-day a &s;upporter of liberty, to-morrow the &s;lave of ab&s;olute power: and thus, though regularly under the dominion of his in&s;atiable de&s;ires, he &s;eemed always incon&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf. During the fir&s;t years of Charles, the attachment of the nation to their Sovereign deprived him of a field for exerting his abilities; which were only calculated to &s;hine in times of tumult and confu&s;ion. He continued in office, more through the influence of the Earl of Southampton, who&s;e niece he had married, than from any opinion of his political con&s;equence. When Buckingham acquired influence, he attached him&s;elf to his councils<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">James II. 1668.</NOTE>; and this near approach to Charles, was the means of di&s;covering to him talents, which he deemed &s;uitable for executing his &s;chemes.</P>

Charles, who knew the character of Buckingham, propo&s;ed to &s;end him in return to France; in&s;inuating, at the &s;ame time, to Lewis, the propriety of gaining him to their &s;e|cret &s;chemes. The acce&s;s to Buckingham was ea&s;y, through the channels of his vanity and avarice. The King of France a&s;&s;ailed him through both. The Duche&s;s of Orleans was &s;oon forgot. He ran with eagerne&s;s into the views of the Kings; and A&s;hley, who &s;till adhered to his councils, adopted, with lit|tle difficulty, the mea&s;ure. A ridiculous farce was now begun. The treaty concluded at Dover, ex|cept in the article concerning the Popi&s;h religion, was brought again into negotiation, as originating from Buckingham. Charles employed the &s;ecret councils of the re&s;t of the year, in impo&s;ing upon a &s;ervant &s;carce worthy of being deceived.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">French in|va&s;ion of Lorrain.</NOTE> While this pretended treaty was in agitation, Lewis formed his mea&s;ures upon the faith of that already concluded. The inva&s;ion of Holland was the chief object of the alliance; and he took the fir&s;t &s;tep toward the execution of the projected &s;cheme. To the United Provinces from France, there were two ways for conducting an army. The one lay through the Spani&s;h Netherlands, the other through the territories of the German Princes upon the Rhine. A voluntary pa&s;&s;age through the fir&s;t was not to be expected; and to force it would be both dangerous and tedious. The latter appeared to be attended with the lea&s;t difficulty and mo&s;t advantage. The petty princes of Germany might be in&s;ulted with &s;afe|ty, or corrupted with ea&s;e. The Duke of Lorrain, as being the neare&s;t, was the fir&s;t attacked. To gain his concurrence was impo&s;&s;ible, on account of the memory of former injuries.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Imperious conduct of Charles.</NOTE> Though Charles and Lewis were re&s;olved to adhere to their engagements, &s;ome alterations were now made in the conditions of the &s;ecret alliance. The vanity of commanding &s;ix thou&s;and men, as an aid from England to France in the Dutch war, was one of the chief motives to the eagerne&s;s with which Bucking|ham entered into that &s;cheme. Mountague, the Eng|li&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, had induced Lewis to depart from that demand. Buckingham a&s;cribed to private pique again&s;t him&s;elf a mea&s;ure which Charles con&s;idered as a public benefit. Haughty, from an opinion of his being the fir&s;t promoter of the alliance, he could not brook this di&s;appointment to his ambition. He ab|&s;ented him&s;elf from the court. He affected to be of|fended with the King. Charles, con&s;cious of the &s;i|ni&s;trous tendency of the &s;ecret treaty, carried his be|haviour to tho&s;e who &s;igned it into a kind of in&s;ult.

To widen the breach with the States, Sir George Downing &s;et out in the beginning of De|cember, with the title of amba&s;&s;ador, to the Hague. The rude pertinacity of Downing, and the aver&s;ion which aro&s;e, from a perfect knowledge of his charac|ter, among the Dutch, rendered him fit for a journey, the object of which was to find a &s;pecious pretence for war. His bu&s;ine&s;s was to complain, and not to nego|tiate; to denounce vengeance, more than to demand &s;atisfaction. It was remarkable, that during the four years &s;ince the treaty of Breda, the Dutch had fur|ni&s;hed no ground of complaint, except the re&s;u&s;al of their admiral, in the month of Augu&s;t, to &s;trike to the Engli&s;h flag. Their fears of France had reduced them into a temper that wi&s;hed to retain the friend&s;hip of England by their own moderation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nece&s;&s;ities of the King.</NOTE> Though the &s;um granted in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of par|liament was ample, it was not equal to the nece&s;&s;ities of the crown. The great remittances received from France were al&s;o lo&s;t, in the unaccountable vortex of old demands. The &s;tanding revenue, if even manag|ed with oeconomy, was inadequate to the common purpo&s;es of government; and now it was anticipated, by mortgages to money-brokers, bankers, and u&s;urers. To remove the&s;e re&s;traints was the fir&s;t object of every &s;upply. But one debt was &s;carce paid, when another was incurred. Di&s;tre&s;s was followed by diffi|culty; and Charles felt all the inconveniences incident to private extravagance, in his public profu&s;ion. The expence of the navy, as it could never be a&s;certained with preci&s;ion, was peculiarly di&s;tre&s;sful to a govern|ment negligent of checks upon its &s;ervants. The amount of outlays on a land-force may be previou&s;ly calculated, with &s;ome degree of certainty. No com|putation can be made of the accidents of tides and winds. The King was particularly &s;ond of maritime affairs; but want of money forced him to neglect, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the navy, after the peace of Breda. Though near a million of the late &s;upply was expend|ed on the fleet, fifty capital &s;hips were not ready to put to &s;ea. The inactivity of Charles through the

<MILESTONE N="1672" UNIT="year"> &s;ummer 1671 proceeded from his want of re&s;ources and the mea&s;ures which he projected were too unpo|pular to hope for an aid from a parliament, who&s;e meeting might now be attended with danger.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The exche|quer &s;hut.</NOTE> To &s;upply his immediate wants, the King adopted a &s;cheme, as ruinous to his future convenience as it was contrary to the public faith. The &s;hutting up the exchequer, attributed to the &s;ugge&s;tions of A&s;hley<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Arlington's Letters.</NOTE>, and adopted by Clifford, is ju&s;tly deemed, if not the wor&s;t, the mo&s;t imprudent mea&s;ure of the pre&s;ent reign. On the &s;econd of January, Charles i&s;&s;ued a proclama|tion, &s;u&s;pending all payments upon a&s;&s;ignations in the exchequer for one whole year. An explanation of the &s;ubject may throw light on the hard&s;hips attending a mea&s;ure, which filled London with a general di&s;tru&s;t and con&s;ternation. The gold&s;miths, who then were the bankers, were accu&s;tomed to advance their money in the exchequer upon the &s;ecurity of the funds upon which parliament had charged their &s;upplies. They derived, from the nece&s;&s;ities of the crown, an ample intere&s;t for their loans; and they were repaid gradu|ally, as the money levied upon the public came into the exchequer. One million four hundred thou&s;and pounds had been, at eight <HI>per cent.</HI> lodged in the trea|&s;ury, upon the faith of the money-bills pa&s;&s;ed in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">R.

To apply the funds, as they came in, to the &s;ame pur|po&s;es, was the object of a mea&s;ure that was adopted with &s;uch &s;ecre&s;y, that the &s;uddenne&s;s of the evil pre|vented its being preceded by fear.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections.</NOTE> The murmurs of the people, the con&s;ternation of the citizens, the &s;tagnation which di&s;tru&s;t created in commerce, were lo&s;t on the King and his &s;ervants.

the aid of parliament, that he thought him&s;elf &s;o &s;ure of &s;ucce&s;s, that he became carele&s;s of the com|plaints of his &s;ubjects. The conque&s;t of the Dutch Republic, he &s;uppo&s;ed, would &s;carce furni&s;h employ|ment for one campaign; and he could &s;trike off, from that moment, the fetters that rendered him &s;o unea&s;y at home. He, however, endeavoured to ju&s;tify his conduct to the world. He &s;ignified the nece&s;&s;ity of making preparations, &s;uitable to tho&s;e of his neigh|bours, as the only excu&s;e for a mea&s;ure, of which he pretended not to approve. He promi&s;ed repayment, with &s;ix <HI>per cent.</HI> intere&s;t, at the expiration of the year. He probably intended what he &s;aid; for Charles was not, by nature, unju&s;t. But he abhorred pecu|niary di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;acrificed principle to procure ea&s;e. Through the de&s;pair of a &s;pendthrift, he became pro|fligate; and ju&s;tified to his own mind, his wor&s;t &s;chemes, by the nece&s;&s;ities impo&s;ed by the par&s;imony of parliament.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prepara|tions.</NOTE> Charles, provided with money, by &s;hutting the ex|chequer, now &s;eriou&s;ly applied him&s;elf to preparations for a war. To man the fleet, it was propo&s;ed in the cabinet, to lay an embargo on all ve&s;&s;els outward bound. The Duke of York oppo&s;ed this mea&s;ure, as a &s;top to trade and a detriment to the revenue.<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">James II. 1672.</NOTE>. To &s;upport his opinion, he undertook to man the fleet without any violence; provided the Newfoundland trade might be &s;u&s;pended for the &s;ea&s;on. Being de&s;tin|ed to command the fleet in per&s;on, he required only &s;ixty Engli&s;h &s;hips of the line, twenty frigates, and thirty French men of war to compo&s;e the main fleet. He urged that, in that ca&s;e, a &s;ufficient number of men and &s;hips would be left for convoys; &s;o that the war would create no interruption to commerce<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Tho' the mini&s;try &s;eemed to yield in &s;ome degree to his rea|&s;ons, they afterwards i&s;&s;ued a rigorous proclamation for pre&s;&s;ing men.

the merchants, Charles &s;oon after exerted his prero|gative. He &s;u&s;pended the act of navigation, by his royal will and plea&s;ure: a mea&s;ure of apparent u&s;e to commerce, though as a precedent, dangerous. The King now acted in every thing as if he were ab&s;olute. He looked upon the &s;ucce&s;s of the war as certain; and he hoped to become independent of a parliament, who&s;e par&s;imony was the &s;ole check on his power.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Attack on the Smyrna fleet.</NOTE> His fir&s;t mea&s;ure in the war met with little &s;ucce&s;s; and it de&s;erved no applau&s;e. The attempt upon the Smyrna fleet, was called piracy by the Dutch; and few Engli&s;h writers gave it a &s;ofter name. To attack an enemy, without a formal declaration of war, was not then ju&s;tified by example; though it has fre|quently &s;ince been a&s;cribed to &s;pirit, or con&s;idered as the re&s;ult of political prudence. Sir Robert Holmes, with &s;even frigates, was ordered to intercept the Smyrna fleet, as it pa&s;&s;ed through the channel. On the thirteenth of March, he de&s;cried them off Port&s;|mouth. They con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ixty merchant-men, under the convoy of &s;even &s;hips of war<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">James II. 1672.</NOTE>. They were prepared for defence. The Dutch, &s;u&s;pecting the de|&s;igns of the court of England, had armed their mer|chant-men, to prevent a &s;urprize.

He entertained al&s;o a private pique again&s;t Spragge, and he envied him a &s;hare in the glory which he hoped to acquire. The event was an&s;werable to his folly. He engaged with courage, but he failed in conduct. The Dutch, in a running fight, defended them&s;elves with &s;pirit. Their admiral was at length killed, and his &s;hip &s;unk.

He had been forced to come to an|chor a league to the ea&s;tward of the outermo&s;t &s;hips, for fear of being driven to the leeward of the fleet, the wind being north-ea&s;t, and a leeward tide. This circum&s;tance furni&s;hed him with an opportunity of having the fir&s;t knowledge of the enemy. As he was getting under &s;ail, two Dutch &s;couts fell in with him; and though each was of equal force, they forbore to fire, brought to, and then &s;tood away. He rightly judged that their fleet was not far a&s;tern. To give notice of the enemy's approach, he fired all the way as he &s;tood in toward the Engli&s;h. At break of day, the Dutch were &s;een to the windward, bearing down on the Duke. Their fir&s;t line and their fire-&s;hips were nearer in with the &s;hore. Their flag-&s;hips were farther to &s;ea. The Duke of York, on the fir&s;t alarm, got his whole fleet under &s;ail. He endeavour|ed to place them in their &s;everal &s;tations in order of battle; but by rea&s;on of the leeward tide and ea&s;t|wind, few could get in when the engagement began. Not above twenty of the red and blue bore the whole brunt of De Ruyter and Van Ghent's &s;quadrons. The French were &s;carce charged at all by the Zealand &s;quadron<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>

The Dutch, u&s;ing their chain-&s;hot, and directing their fire to the rigging, di&s;|abled the Prince; and his Royal Highne&s;s was obliged to &s;hift his flag on board the St. Michael, commanded by Sir Robert Holmes<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Public Intell.</NOTE>. Two &s;hips &s;ent to burn the Prince were &s;unk by the Duke. But the Earl of Sandwich, after performing prodigies of valour, was burnt in the Royal James. In a clo&s;e engagement with Van Ghent, he blew that admiral, and beat off his &s;hip<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">James II. 1672.</NOTE>. He &s;unk another &s;hip which laid him on board. He &s;ent to the bottom two fire-&s;hips as they advanced. Of one thou&s;and men on board, one half were &s;aid to be dead on the deck, before his &s;hip was burnt by a third fire-&s;hip. The Earl him&s;elf was drowned in endeavouring to &s;wim to &s;ome other &s;hip. There is no rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that he &s;acrificed his life to a reflection on his courage, uttered by the Duke of York. A difference of opinion could not have happened between them about putting to &s;ea.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Progre&s;s of France.</NOTE> During the&s;e operations at &s;ea, a &s;trom more dread|ful was fa&s;t advancing on Holland by land. The King of France, dividing into three bodies an army con|&s;i&s;ting of 120,000 men, put them all in motion in the beginning of May. The fir&s;t he led in per&s;on, with the famous Turenne. The Prince of Cond&eacute; com|manded the &s;econd; the Count de Chamilli the third. The latter took Ma&s;eic on the fifteenth of May. Or|&s;oi fell into the hands of the King on the third of June. Burich yielded to the arms of Turenne. Rhim|berg opened its gates on the &s;ixth of the month to Lewis. Beauvir&eacute; &s;eized Do&euml;tkum on the eighth. Grool was taken on the ninth, by the troops of the Bi&s;hop of Mun&s;ter. The twelfth of June was &s;igna|lized by the pa&s;&s;age of the Rhine. Turenne became, three days after, ma&s;ter of Arnheim.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reduction of three provinces.</NOTE> The progre&s;s of Lewis, like the cour&s;e of an inun|dation, levelled every thing, then covered all. March|ing forth to conque&s;t rather than to war, he carried the magnificence and gaiety of a court to the field. With all the triumphs of a victor he entered Utrecht; though he owed more to the unprepared &s;tate of the enemy than to his own conduct. Surrounded with flatterers and attended by poets, to celebrate his ex|ploits, he gave &s;cope to that vanity, which in him was a kind of virtue. To men who mea&s;ure merit by &s;uc|ce&s;s, there certainly appeared a foundation for fame. In the cour&s;e of a few weeks, the three provinces of Gueldres, Utrecht, and Overy&s;&s;el had &s;ubmitted to the arms of France. Frie&s;eland and Gronighen were invaded by her ally, the Bi&s;hop of Mun&s;ter. The ma|ritime provinces, Holland and Zealand, only remained free. Forty fortified cities either opened their gates through terror, or, after a faint re&s;i&s;tance, &s;urrendered without terms. Europe was &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment rather than with admiration. The Dutch, unmanned by their fears, left almo&s;t a bloodle&s;s victory to Lewis. The enemy, by their cowardice, deprived the con|queror of glory; and &s;eemed, by their &s;piritle&s;s con|duct, to be even unworthy of their independence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Unprepared &s;tate of the Dutch.</NOTE> Though the Dutch had fore&s;een a tempe&s;t, which now broke on them with &s;uch violence, their prepara|tions were dilatory and feeble. Divided into factions, every &s;cheme for defence was either oppo&s;ed, or ren|dered ineffectual, by being retarded. Terror it&s;elf could not e&s;tabli&s;h unanimity among parties embittered again&s;t each other by a long oppo&s;ition. The Louve&s;|tein faction, who carried in their very appellation the memory of an injury, were the mo&s;t numerous, and headed by the pen&s;ionary De Wit. The adherents of the Prince of Orange, weakened by a long minority, began to acquire &s;trength and con&s;equence, from their leader's character and years. The&s;e two parties, to|gether with a third, who affected a kind of neutrality, comprehended the whole body of the States. The moderate faction, impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of danger, or in hopes to regain the favour of the King of Eng|land, joined the friends of the Prince of Orange; and on the twenty-fourth of February he was rai&s;ed
<PB N="153" REF="171">
to the dignity of Captain-general and Admiral of the United Provinces. The perpetual edict by which he was excluded from the Stadholder&s;hip, however, re|mained unrepealed. The oppo&s;ition of parties con|tinued; and the intere&s;t of the public was neglected in their animo&s;ities.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of the Prince of Orange.</NOTE> The Prince of Orange began now, for the fir&s;t time, to di&s;play a character as &s;ingular in it&s;elf as the fortune of his life was extraordinary. To a gravity and &s;ilence which di&s;tingui&s;hed his early youth with the prudence thought peculiar to years, he joined a firmne&s;s in all his mea&s;ures that bordered on ob&s;tinacy. Without a con&s;titution for plea&s;ure, his chief object was an am|bition for power and a great name. De&s;titute of tho&s;e brilliant parts which dazzle the world, he acquired weight with mankind by the &s;olidity of his under&s;tand|ing. His per&s;onal courage was tempered with circum|&s;pection and coolne&s;s; his &s;lowne&s;s in action corrected by his per&s;everance. In his carriage and manner he was rather re&s;pectable than dignified, more decent than amiable in private life. Phlegmatic in his di&s;po|&s;ition, he was &s;ubject to no pa&s;&s;ion in the extreme; and the &s;ame cau&s;e that exempted him from vice, ob|&s;cured the lu&s;tre of his virtues. Born with abilities for the cabinet, but with no great talents for the field, his policy, perpetually at war with his fortune, at length prevailed; and though he &s;carce ever won a battle, he frequently reaped all the advantages of victory from defeat. Though he cannot be accu&s;ed of wanton ty|ranny, he was extremely fond of power; he &s;acrific|ed his virtue to his ambition; and, without any gla|ring inju&s;tice, frequently de&s;cended to meanne&s;&s;es to accompli&s;h his favourite de&s;igns. He was happy throughout his life in his opponent. The mad bigotry of James the Second might have furni&s;hed a field of triumph for abilities more circum&s;cribed than tho&s;e of the Prince, as the former had at once to contend with the favourite pa&s;&s;ions of his own people, and the art of his rival. Upon the whole, though great things re&s;ulted from the conduct of the Prince of Orange, he was not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e brilliant qualities which are generally deemed nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute a great man.</P>

Orange. Unprovided with an army, and adding con|&s;ternation to their weakne&s;s, they were actually what they &s;eemed, an ea&s;y prey. De Wit, who had govern|ed their councils for many years, carried his private prejudices into his public conduct. In oppo&s;ition to the power of the hou&s;e of Orange, he di&s;couraged a land force, and threw the whole &s;trength of the mari|time provinces into the navy. Tru&s;ting to the weak|ne&s;s of Spain, and fortified by their ancient alliance with France, the States them&s;elves had, ever &s;ince the peace of We&s;tphalia, been extremely negligent of their troops. A &s;hew of an army was kept up, but it was altogether de&s;titute of di&s;cipline, and ignorant of every military duty. Though the troops were encrea&s;ed be|fore the arrival of the French, to &s;eventy thou&s;and men, they were &s;o raw and timid, that the Prince, not daring to &s;hew them to the enemy, retired to the province of Holland, whil&s;t Lewis took at his lei&s;ure almo&s;t all the fortified towns of the upper Provinces.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince of Orange de|clared Stadt|holder.</NOTE> In proportion as the danger advanced toward the province of Holland, the vulgar became outrageous through their fears. The States them&s;elves lo&s;t their pre&s;ence of mind. De Wit, declining in his credit, could no longer animate his countrymen to their own defence: on the contrary, they now attributed their misfortunes to his neglect of the army. All per&s;ons ran with violence into the party of the Prince of Orange, and &s;eemed to think that the very being of the States depended upon his abilities. Am&s;terdam alone retained &s;ome appearance of &s;pirit. They open|ed their &s;luices, and laid their whole country under water. But the &s;afety derived from that barrier again&s;t the enemy could not infu&s;e courage into the dejected States. The body of the nobles and eleven towns voted to &s;end amba&s;&s;adors to implore the pity of the two Kings. They offered to &s;urrender all the frontier towns which lay beyond the limits of the &s;even pro|vinces, and to pay a con&s;iderable &s;um toward the charges of the war. Lewis, left by Turenne, who had marched into Germany, was led in his councils by de Louvois and de Pomponne. The violence of
<PB N="155" REF="173">
the former &s;aved the States<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Henault, 1672.</NOTE>. His unrea&s;onable de|mands threw them into a de&s;pair, which overcame their fears. The people ro&s;e at Dort, and forced their magi&s;trates to &s;ign the repeal of the perpetual edict. The other cities followed their example, and on the fifth of July the Prince of Orange was rai&s;ed to the Stadtholder&s;hip of the unconquered provinces.</P>

The arbi|trary mea&s;ure of &s;hutting the exchequer created private murmurs, but produced no public remon&s;trances. The jealou&s;y of trade rendered the city of London cold with regard to the fate of the Dutch. The prior conduct of that people claimed no love from the Eng|li&s;h in general. Haughty in their pro&s;perity, and un|principled, as a &s;tate, through the love of gain, they had formerly extended their injuries through every channel of commerce. Their moderation of late years was a&s;cribed to fear, and not to ju&s;tice; and the me|mory of the in&s;ult with which they clo&s;ed the la&s;t, recommended the pre&s;ent war from a motive of revenge. The inequality in force vi&s;ible between the contending parties, the manife&s;t inju&s;tice on the &s;ide of their ene|mies, entitled the Dutch to pity; but even that pa&s;&s;ion, notwith&s;tanding the ancient animo&s;ity again&s;t France, excited no &s;ymptom of dangerous di&s;content.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Parliament meets.</NOTE> Charles, when he hoped to put an end to his dif|ficulties by the Dutch war, found him&s;elf involved in accumulated nece&s;&s;ities by that mea&s;ure.

Sir Edward Turner having been made chief baron of the exchequer, the commons proceeded to the election of a new &s;peaker.

His Maje&s;ty's &s;peech partook of the firmne&s;s which had hitherto di&s;tingui&s;hed the councils of the mini&s;try.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><MILESTONE N="1674" UNIT="year"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Parliament prorogued.</NOTE> THOUGH the peace with Holland relieved the King from many of his difficulties, it &s;ooth|ed not his parliament into any compliance. His me|&s;ures, for &s;everal years, were thought &s;o contrary to the intere&s;ts of his &s;ubjects, at lea&s;t, &s;o oppo&s;ite to their opinions, that in pur&s;uing them, he lo&s;t almo&s;t all his former popularity and influence. Di&s;tru&s;t pre|vailed among the people, and jealou&s;y joined all its force to faction in the hou&s;e of commons. The endeavours of the King to ingratiate him&s;elf by com|pliance, were de&s;eated by the &s;olly of his brother, who with an enthu&s;ia&s;m &s;carce con&s;i&s;tent with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of rea&s;on, &s;eemed to glory in a &s;y&s;tem of faith which his country abhorred. The ferment was too high to be &s;ettled by any thing but time. The King came &s;uddenly to the hou&s;e of peers on the
<PB N="184" REF="202">
twenty-fourth of February<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">Journals, Feb. 24.</NOTE>, and prorogued his par|liament to the tenth of November. No &s;upply was granted, no bill what&s;oever pa&s;&s;ed both hou&s;es<NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">James II. 1674.</NOTE>.&mdash;During debates of &s;uch violence and long continuance, there was but one private bill and two of a public concern &s;ent up by the commons to the lords; and the latter &s;ent down to the lower hou&s;e but one of each kind<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Though the King's party could not prevent &s;pirited re&s;olutions, they were &s;ufficiently nu|merous to clog the progre&s;s of bills that were di&s;|agreeable to the crown.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Charles meditates a peace.</NOTE> The &s;ummer of the year 1674 produced no events of importance in England. Shafte&s;bury, with his u&s;ual activity, endeavoured to keep up the jealou&s;ies of the people till the meeting of parliament. Pretending a fear of being a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by the Papi&s;ts, he lay in the city, in the hou&s;e of one Cook, a fanatic; and exerted all his abilities to promote petitions to the King, for calling a parliament for the redre&s;s of grievances. His &s;ucce&s;s ro&s;e not in proportion to his zeal. He was about to take a hou&s;e in the city, but Charles &s;ent him a peremptory me&s;&s;age; and he retired to the country<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. An unexpected tran|quillity prevailed; and men &s;eemed to have forgot their terrors for popery and arbitrary power. The war on the continent remained in an undeci&s;ive &s;tate. The Dutch, joined by Spain and the Empire, were now upon an equal footing with France, though provided with the be&s;t generals of the age, and well-appointed armies. The King, to gratify his people, a&s;&s;umed the character of a mediator between the contending powers; but either his &s;incerity was &s;u&s;|pected by the allies, or their hopes of victory render|ed them dead to terms. The court of Spain, with its u&s;ual violence, had engaged the Dutch to con|tinue the war till things &s;hould be re&s;tored to the &s;ame &s;ituation as at the treaty of the Pyrenees.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Campaign in Germany</NOTE> The French had three great armies in the field; the fir&s;t in Germany, the &s;econd in Flanders, and

On the &s;ide of Germany, the Mare&s;chal de Turenne, having pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine at Philip&s;burgh, defeated the Count Caprara, at Sint|zeim, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the whole Palatinate, by driving the allies beyond the Neckar and the Maine. With twenty thou&s;and men, he fell upon an army of &s;eventy, under the Duke of Lorrain, near Stra&s;bourg, and drove them from the field with great lo&s;s. He again defeated the allies at Malhau&s;en, be|fore the end of the campaign. The&s;e repeated victo|ries drove the war from the confines of France. Franche Comt&eacute; was in the mean time reduced by her arms. The King in per&s;on commanded his troops on that &s;ide. There was no enemy in the field; and town fell after town into his hands. The whole pro|vince was conquered with little blood&s;hed; and Lewis, re&s;olving to retain it for ever, transferred the &s;eat of public ju&s;tice from Dole to Be&s;an&ccedil;on.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and Flan|ders.</NOTE> On the eleventh of Augu&s;t<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> was fought in Flan|ders, the famous battle of Senef, a village between Marimont and Nivelle. The Prince of Orange, at the head of the army of the allies, con&s;i&s;ting of eighty thou&s;and men, was oppo&s;ed by an inferior force, under the Prince of Cond&eacute;. The French at|tacked the rear of the confederates, in a narrow de|file, as they marched toward Binch; and throwing them into confu&s;ion, &s;eized a great part of their can|non and baggage. The Prince of Orange, le&s;s re|markable for preventing misfortune than &s;topping its progre&s;s, acquired &s;ome glory, though he obtained no victory. He rallied his troops. He fell upon the enemy. He expo&s;ed his own per&s;on. In the action, which was not fini&s;hed with the day, he joined the valour of a young &s;oldier to the conduct of an expe|rienced general. When night came on, both armies, as if by mutual con&s;ent, put an end to the fight, and left the victory undecided. The lo&s;s was almo&s;t equal. Six thou&s;and of each &s;ide lay dead on the field. The allies kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place of battle, but the French had mo&s;t trophies. The Prince of Orange

But the good fortune which had attended the allies in the preceding &s;ummer, began now to for&s;ake their arms. The year began with an advantage at &s;ea in favour of the French. De Ruyter, who had &s;ailed from Holland in Augu&s;t with an intention to join the Spani&s;h fleet, fell in with Du Que&s;ne, on the eighth of January, on his way to throw &s;uccours into Me&s;|&s;ina.

Go|vernment went forward in its beaten track. The country was torn to pieces by the quarrels and ani|mo&s;ities of factions. But the&s;e were private di&s;tractions. In public, a &s;hew of implicit obedience was ob&s;erved by all parties towards the crown.

Strictly adhering to the con&s;titution, he refu&s;ed obedience to the royal or|ders, when he thought them contrary to law. Charles

The misfortunes of the con|federates, the natural con&s;equence of their own long negligence, &s;eemed to favour the impatience of the Dutch for peace. The feeble councils of Spain, the want of re&s;ources in the Empire, the backwardne&s;s of the German princes, together with the hopes which all derived from the eagerne&s;s of the Engli&s;h nation again&s;t their ancient enemies and rivals the French, concurred to render their efforts languid and unde|ci&s;ive.

Though this panic was in parliament an engine of ambition to the facti|ous, it was a matter of &s;erious importance among the people in general. Murmurs were heard from every &s;ide; and Charles, hating trouble, was willing to put an end to clamours that di&s;turbed his repo&s;e. His unfortunate connections with France, the ob&s;ti|nate bigotry of his brother, the pecuniary nece&s;&s;ities which had betrayed him into violent mea&s;ures, had lo&s;t to him his popularity, and filled the minds of his people with apprehen&s;ions of Popery and arbitra|ry power. To gain their affections, one mea&s;ure only remained: to give the pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne to a Prote&s;tant Prince, and to put an end to the fears of the nation, by procuring a gene|ral peace. The marriage of the Prince of Orange to his brother's elde&s;t daughter &s;eemed to promi&s;e both the&s;e de&s;irable ends; and he, therefore, embrac|ed with eagerne&s;s a renewal of tho&s;e propo&s;als which had formerly been made by the Prince.</P>

Charles informed them, that the French King had propo&s;ed a ce&s;&s;ation of arms, which he be|lieved would end in a general peace. The commons immediately voted, that all forces levied &s;ince the twenty-ninth of the preceding September &s;hould be paid off and di&s;banded. Six hundred thou&s;and pounds were granted for that purpo&s;e. The King a&s;ked in vain for a fund of three hundred thou&s;and pounds to &s;upply the deficiency in his &s;tanding revenue.

But the confederates, long divided in their councils, had at length begun to &s;eparate their re&s;pective in|tere&s;ts. The re&s;ources of the Dutch had failed, through the great expence of the war, and the ruin which it had brought on their commerce.

This change in their opinions proceeded from other cau&s;es as well as from the exhau&s;ted &s;tate of their finances. The eagerne&s;s of the Prince of Orange for continu|ing the war, his late connection with the royal line of England, the former influence of his family, and their frequent attempts on the liberties of a peo|ple whom they were cho&s;en to defend, were placed in the mo&s;t &s;u&s;picious light by the agents of France.

The country-party, if that appellation may be u&s;ed with regard to Hol|land, were the makers of a peace, which was to de|prive the Prince of Orange of a part of his dangerous power. His eagerne&s;s for continuing the war was THEIR chief inducement to bring it to a &s;peedy con|clu&s;ion. His friends ob&s;tructed the treaty with all their influence.

He promi&s;ed, if the Dutch would join him, to declare an immediate war; and to &s;upport it with the utmo&s;t vigour, till France &s;hould be reduced to terms of more advantage to Eu|rope.

Having arranged, to their own &s;atisfaction, the particulars of the intended impo&s;ture, Tong prevailed on his friend Kirby to carry in&s;inuations of a plot to the King, to whom he was per&s;onally known. On the twelfth of Augu&s;t, as Charles, according to his daily cu&s;tom, was walking in the Park, Kirby addre&s;&s;ed him ab|ruptly, de&s;ired him to keep within the company, a&s;|&s;uring him that his enemies had an immediate de&s;ign upon his life.

Grove and Pickering, the one an ordained Je&s;uit, the other a lay-brother of the &s;ame order, were fir&s;t appointed to &s;hoot the King; but after|wards it was re&s;olved to di&s;patch him with poi&s;on, by the means of Sir George Wakeman, the Queen's phy&s;ician, and a papi&s;t.

Every per&s;on was now em|ployed either in hearing or telling &s;trange reports. The truth was magnified by the fears of the people. The mo&s;t gro&s;s inventions, the mo&s;t improbable fic|tions were received as certain fact.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Coleman's letters.</NOTE> In the mid&s;t of this terror and &s;u&s;pen&s;e, &s;ome col|lateral incidents &s;eemed to place the truth of a plot beyond di&s;pute, in the eyes of a credulous people. Coleman, before his hou&s;e was &s;earched, found means to convey away his letters for the two la&s;t years, to|gether with his book of entries. In his confu&s;ion he left in a drawer &s;ome copies of letters, which he had written to Father la Chai&s;e, the French King's con|fe&s;&s;or, to the Pope's nuncio at Bru&s;&s;els, to other Ca|tholics abroad.

Sanguine beyond mea&s;ure, thro' the &s;ury of his zeal, he in&s;inuated, in a kind of inco|herent jargon, the great expectations which he enter|tained of the conver&s;ion of the three Briti&s;h kingdoms, and the total ruin of the Prote&s;tant religion, which this fooli&s;h zealot called a pe&s;ti&s;ent here&s;y. He built his hopes on the zeal of the Duke of York, and

&s;poke in indefinite and ob&s;cure terms of aid from abroad, to accompli&s;h what he denominated a glorious work. He in&s;inuated in other letters, that the inte|re&s;ts of the French and Engli&s;h royal families, and tho&s;e of the Romi&s;h faith, were in&s;eparable. He propo&s;ed to la Chai&s;e to procure a remittance of three hundred thou&s;and pounds from France for the di&s;&s;olu|tion of the parliament; which mea&s;ure would greatly forward their views.

They &s;uppo&s;ed that the &s;ub&s;equent letters contained a full information of a plot, as yet very imperfectly known. This incident was followed by another, which put an end to every doubt. On the &s;ixth of September<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">L'E&s;trange's Ca&s;e, &amp;c.</NOTE>, Sir Edmondbury God|frey, a man of a good character, but of a melan|choly di&s;po&s;ition, who had acted many years as a ju&s;|tice of the peace in We&s;tmin&s;ter, was prevailed upon by &s;ome of the popular party to &s;wear Otes to the fir&s;t narrative delivered to the King by Doctor Tong.

The&s;e depo&s;itions were pre&s;ented on the &s;ame day to the King and council by Tong. Godfrey, on Satur|day the twelfth of October, &s;uddenly di&s;appeared. No tidings were heard of him till Thur&s;day the &s;even|teenth, when he was found dead in a ditch near Prim|ro&s;e-hill, on the way to Hamp&s;tead, with his &s;word run through his body. No blood appeared on his clothes. His money was in his pocket, his rings on his fingers, his &s;hoes were clean. His gloves and his

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;terna|tion of the people.</NOTE> The whole city poured round the body, which lay expo&s;ed to public view for two whole days. Every one concluded that Godfrey was murdered by the Pa|pi&s;ts, for taking the oath of Otes concerning a plot in which they were deemed to be all concerned. The pa&s;&s;ions of the populace were rai&s;ed to a degree of madne&s;s, by the moving &s;ight of the body. The &s;pi|rits of the better &s;ort were inflamed by terror, &s;urmi&s;es, and &s;u&s;picions. The evidence of Otes, with all its con|tradictions and ab&s;urdities, was implicitly &s;wallowed by all degrees of people. Men, who pre&s;umed to rea|&s;on the &s;ubject, were hated like accomplices in the plot. The whole ran down in one torrent on the &s;ide of a popi&s;h con&s;piracy. Charles, perceiving that it was dangerous, if not impo&s;&s;ible to oppo&s;e the &s;tream, added his own force to its violence. He no longer &s;eemed to form a doubt on a &s;ubject which his pene|trating judgment could never permit him to believe. He i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, offering a reward of five hun|dred pounds to any per&s;on who &s;hould di&s;cover the murder; and, as it had been in&s;inuated that many might be kept from giving their evidence through fear, he promi&s;ed all &s;ecurity to the per&s;ons of the di&s;cover|ers. The alarm &s;pread from London through the whole kingdom. The bu&s;ine&s;s of life was interrupted by confu&s;ion, panic, clamour, dreadful rumours; and the unfortunate Catholics began to be afraid of the ma&s;&s;acre, of the de&s;ign of which they them&s;elves were accu&s;ed<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Vid.

Men thought that all along he had acted in concert with the French King. They deem|ed his profe&s;&s;ions in favour of the allies a mere decep|tion. They looked upon his preparations for war as means for procuring money from his &s;ubjects, or for e&s;tabli&s;hing over them an arbitrary power. Many who

They con&s;i&s;ted, be&s;ides the let|ters, of various mi&s;managements in his office. Some were frivolous, others ill founded. The charge of ca|pacity, though un&s;upported with glaring in&s;tances, &s;eemed to be the lea&s;t unju&s;t. Danby was poor, and he loved money; but his ma&s;ter was neither full of genero&s;ity, nor abounding in wealth.

He &s;hewed that Mountague, the informer again&s;t him, had him&s;elf promoted with ardour the money-negotiations with France. He dwelt, with a degree of ju&s;tice, on his diligence in tracing the Popi&s;h plot. He cleared him|&s;elf of the a&s;per&s;ion of alienating the King's revenue to improper purpo&s;es. He obviated the charge of ra|pacity, by a&s;&s;uring the hou&s;e, that his acqui&s;itions were more moderate than tho&s;e obtained by others in his office.

The friends of the trea&s;urer affirmed, that the utmo&s;t that could be &s;aid in favour of the charge, was to &s;uppo&s;e it ture; and had it even been true, the crimes alledged fell not within the &s;tatute of Edward III. To this argu|ment the popular party replied, that the commons who had exhibited the charge, were to be heard on two points; fir&s;t on the proof, and then on the nature of the crime. They propo&s;ed, therefore, that the charge &s;hould be received; and that the hou&s;e, according to the rules of parliament, ought to commit the accu&s;ed per&s;on, and to appoint a &s;hort day for his trial. The majority of the Peers, upon a divi&s;ion, were again&s;t the commitment of Danby. The King found him|&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;upporting the mini&s;ter, and he u&s;ed all his influence. The commons however in|&s;i&s;ted, that Danby &s;hould be &s;eque&s;tered from parlia|ment and committed.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections on Mounta|gue's con|duct.</NOTE> The impeachment of the lord-trea&s;urer diverted, in &s;ome degree, the attention of the people from the Popi&s;h plot.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Difference concerning a &s;peaker.</NOTE> The expected effect of this &s;oothing &s;peech was bla&s;ted by a &s;udden difference between Charles and the lower hou&s;e. Seymour, who had been &s;peaker in the la&s;t parliament, was cho&s;en again to that office; but he was rejected by the King, when he was pre&s;ented in the u&s;ual form. A prior quarrel with Danby was the &s;ource of this affront on Seymour. He had been privately in the pay of the crown, and he carried his gratitude to the court to a degree which merited and received cen&s;ure. But the payment of the pen&s;ion cea&s;ed with his &s;ervices, and he, therefore, had herd|ed of late with the popular party. The commons, returning to their hou&s;e, fell into warm debates. Meres, propo&s;ed by the court-party, was rejected with di&s;dain. They agreed that the choice of their own &s;peaker was a right inherent in the commons; that the pre&s;enting him to the King for approbation was a matter of mere form. They pre&s;ented an ad|dre&s;s on that &s;ubject; but it was an&s;wered by a pro|rogation. The affair was, at length compromi&s;ed. Seymour was, for the time, &s;et a&s;ide. The right of the hou&s;e was, however, a&s;certained.

They were alarmed at a circum&s;tance which &s;eemed calculated to throw the weight of the Scoti&s;h nation in the &s;cale of their greate&s;t foe. The Duke took leave of his brother on the twenty-fifth of September, and, by the way of Holland, joined his family at Bru&s;|&s;els. He wrote, according to a prior concert, from that place, on his arrival, to a&s;k the King's leave to retire to Scotland; and to carry the Ladies Anne and I&s;abella, who had been lately permitted to vi&s;it the Duche&s;s, to &s;ee their &s;i&s;ter the Prince&s;s of Orange.&mdash;The yachts were &s;ent to bring him from Holland. Some frigates were ordered to carry him&s;elf and his family to Scotland. Upon his arrival in the Downs, he returned to London. The &s;ea&s;on of the year was improper for a voyage by &s;ea. The Duche&s;s was &s;o ill that &s;he vomited blood. His two daughters were indi&s;po&s;ed. A week after his arrival at London, he began his journey northward.

When he made a me|rit of yielding to the King's plea&s;ure in quitting the kingdom, he continued his corre&s;pondence with the country-party. He held a private meeting with Montague, and other di&s;affected per&s;ons, on the evening of his departure. His very words were car|ried to the King. He informed his friends, that the cau&s;e of his di&s;grace was his advi&s;ing Charles to make up matters with parliament; and, above all, his be|ing firm to the Prote&s;tant religion, the doctrines of which, he affirmed, were by no means favoured by the King. Many of his friends, &s;everal of the nobi|lity, even the Duche&s;s of Monmouth, &s;olicited the King in his favour in vain. He peremptorily ordered him to be gone.

He a&s;&s;ured him, that he never had &s;et up any preten&s;ions to the crown; and that his only object was the &s;afety of his own per&s;on, and the intere&s;ts of the Prote&s;tant religion.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's firmne&s;s.</NOTE> Though the Duke of York laid it down as a maxim in his politics, never to gain an avowed enemy, there is no rea&s;on to a&s;cribe to his councils the new and more &s;pirited conduct of Charles. Pliant in his character, and immoderately fond of ea&s;e, he had, during near twenty years of his reign, changed his mea&s;ures and his &s;ervants, when the opinions of the nation &s;eemed to change. He had hitherto derived nothing but mis|fortune from this accommodating principle. He marked his councils with an appearance of un&s;teadi|ne&s;s, in the eyes of the people. He encouraged &s;ome of his enemies, by his &s;uppo&s;ed timidity of mind. The Earl of Shafte&s;bury had, at two different times, when in the highe&s;t offices of the &s;tate, herded with tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed the mea&s;ures which he him&s;elf ought to guide.

from parliament. He, therefore, a&s;&s;umed at once that firmne&s;s of conduct which he followed during the re&s;t of his reign. He told his council, on the fifteenth of October, that he was re&s;olved to prorogue his parlia|ment for a whole year; and, that very evening, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Shafte&s;bury from the office of pre&s;ident.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dangerfield.</NOTE> The encouragement given by parliament, and the public credulity, had rendered the office of informer profitable, and in &s;ome degree, honourable, in the eyes of profligate men. One Dangerfield, who&s;e wicked|ne&s;s had ju&s;t reached the border of every capital fe|lony, now a&s;pired to the prize which Otes and Bedloe had obtained. This infamous per&s;on had been tran&s;|ported for larceny, pilloried for perjury, fined for frauds, and outlawed for flying from ju&s;tice. To &s;um up his character, he had been the bo&s;om-friend of Bedloe, and his companion upon the high-way. When he could not obtain the money of others, he pa&s;&s;ed fictitious coin of his own. He was, in &s;hort, guilty of every ba&s;e enormity; and as hardened by habit again&s;t puni&s;hment, as he was in&s;en&s;ible of &s;hame. His total want of veracity was his mo&s;t harmle&s;s vice; for his exce&s;&s;ive impudence and folly deprived of all credit his lies. Being hand&s;ome in his per&s;on, he was harboured by one Mrs. Cellier, a Roman-Catholic midwife; a woman of vivacity, and of an ungovern|able pa&s;&s;ion for men. Having formed the outlines of a pretended plot by the Pre&s;byterians again&s;t the go|vernment, he was introduced by Cellier to the coun|te&s;s of Powis, who, by the means of the Earl of Peterborrow, procured for him acce&s;s to the Duke of York, and then to the King<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">Ralph, Burnet.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Meal-tub plot.</NOTE> The improbability of Dangerfield's tale, his clum&s;y artifice of concealing ill-forged papers, in order to be found, his profligate character, and his being &s;eiz|ed by an officer of ju&s;tice for counterfeiting the cur|rent coin, threw a total di&s;credit on his information.
<PB N="284" REF="306">
No warrant could legally be i&s;&s;ued on his evidence. He was left to the law, and confined to Newgate. To extricate him&s;elf from his perilous &s;ituation, he became the author of a new Popi&s;h plot, as &s;uiting be&s;t with the prejudices and credulity of the people. He wrote a circum&s;tantial narrative of his being tempted by the Earl of Ca&s;tlemaine, the Lady Powis, and &s;ome other Catholics, to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the King, and to murder the Earl of Shafte&s;bury. He even accu&s;ed Mrs. Cellier, his patrone&s;s and bo&s;om-friend; and, from the place where &s;ome papers were found in her lodgings, this fictitious con&s;piracy was denominated Meal-tub Plot. This change in Dangerfield's evi|dence was abetted by Shafte&s;bury, and it alarmed, in &s;ome degree, the timid and credulous part of the na|tion. Charles, however, taught by the bad con&s;e|quences of the former plot, re&s;olved to nip this in the bud.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarkable burning of a pope.</NOTE> The popular party, during the interval of parlia|ment, endeavoured to continue the ferment among the people till the next &s;e&s;&s;ion. Shafte&s;bury, with all his fertile invention, laboured to accompli&s;h a point &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to his de&s;igns. At the head of a &s;ociety of de&s;perate and profligate per&s;ons, called the Green-ribbon Club, he projected a public &s;hew, to impre&s;s the minds of the populace with horror and fear for the Popi&s;h plot. On the &s;eventeenth of November, the anniver&s;ary of Queen Elizabeth's coronation-day, it had been u&s;ual in the city of London to burn a pope, with his in&s;eparable companion the devil. This ceremony was performed in the pre&s;ent year with un|common &s;olemnity and expence. In the front of a long proce&s;&s;ion, the principal figure was a dead body car|ried on hor&s;e-back before a Je&s;uit, repre&s;enting that of Godfrey, as he was &s;uppo&s;ed to be conveyed by the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins to Primro&s;e-hill.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Intrigues of the Prince of Orange.</NOTE> But the impre&s;&s;ion made upon an ignorant populace by this &s;ight, was not worth its expence to Shafte&s;bury and the Green-ribbon Club. Sober men, who loved their country, were per&s;uaded that it could not be &s;erved by &s;uch paltry means. Though they enter|tained &s;ome apprehen&s;ions of the pre&s;ent government, they were aver&s;e from exchanging it for the anarchy of a mob. They perceived that re&s;entment, more than the love of public liberty, actuated the mo&s;t ve|hement of the public leaders. Their violence threw a total di&s;credit on their profe&s;&s;ions. Indignation again&s;t their conduct attached many to the crown; and, fortunately for Charles, &s;everal per&s;ons, who liked not his mea&s;ures, thought it their own intere&s;t to &s;upport his authority. Shafte&s;bury, however, was not di&s;couraged. He held a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence with the Prince of Orange, whom he flattered with the hopes of an almo&s;t immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne. In concert with that able, intriguing, and ambitious Prince, he formed a project, in conjunction with nine other peers, to petition<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">D'Avaux, 1679.</NOTE> the King to permit the parliament, which had been prorogued to the twenty-&s;ixth of January, to &s;it at the time appointed. The &s;cheme was to throw Charles into the hands of par|liament; and eventually to deprive him of his throne. Thus far the views of the Prince and of Shafte&s;bury were one. But while the fir&s;t wi&s;hed to transfer the crown to his own head, the latter looked forward to a republic, in which he him&s;elf might exerci&s;e an un|limited authority, under the &s;pecious name of public freedom. Petitions of the &s;ame import with that of Shafte&s;bury and his a&s;&s;ociates were encouraged throughout the kingdom. Some were prepared, and others pre&s;ented. Charles affected to receive them with a mixture of indignation and contempt. He publi&s;hed a proclamation again&s;t the&s;e tumultuous,

and, as he called them, unlawful proceedings. He commanded the lord-mayor of London to &s;uppre&s;s &s;uch petitions as were formed in that city, and to pu|ni&s;h as vagrants the per&s;ons who went about to &s;olicit &s;ub&s;criptions<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">James II.

The Earl of Halifax, feigning indi&s;|po&s;ition, retired from the council; and Sir William Temple, though he had entered into the views of the Prince of Orange<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>, had long preferred the quiet plea&s;ures of the country to the tumult and hurry of public affairs. The new council, from whom the na|tion had expected &s;o much, had been for &s;ome time virtually di&s;&s;olved. Charles took his mo&s;t important re&s;olutions without a&s;king their advice, or he confined his communications to two or three of their number. The factions which prevailed in the nation had &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ed in the council. Shafte&s;bury, followed by Mon|mouth, avowedly abetted the popular cau&s;e.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Petitioners, Abhorrers, Whigs, and Tories.</NOTE> During the&s;e &s;ecret intrigues for his crown, the King of England turned him&s;elf with &s;ome vigour to his more public opponents. The &s;ame arts which were u&s;ed by its enemies again&s;t the court, were adopted by Charles to counteract their de&s;igns. THEY a&s;&s;idu|ou&s;ly procured &s;ub&s;criptions to petitions for the &s;itting of parliament; HE encouraged addre&s;&s;es, expre&s;&s;ive of an entire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the prerogative of the crown. The eagerne&s;s of the two parties, into which the na|tion was divided, carried their virulence again&s;t each other into names of reproach. The adherents of the King, in their addre&s;&s;es, expre&s;&s;ed their abhorrence of the &s;editious manner in which the petitions were pro|cured; and their opponents gave them, from this circum&s;tance, the name of ABHORRERS. The latter thought the appellation of PETITIONERS a &s;ufficient retaliation on their enemies. Though the&s;e epithets &s;unk &s;oon after into oblivion, this year began the names of WHIG and TORY, which have invariably di&s;tingui&s;hed the two political parties that have ever &s;ince divided between them the nation. It is remark|able, that the&s;e ridiculous appellations derived their origin from Scotland and Ireland. The fanatical con|venticlers of the fir&s;t kingdom had been di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Whigs, and the Popi&s;h rabble of the latter country were called Tories. The court-party found a &s;imilitude between the Petitioners and the Scoti&s;h Covenanters; and the oppo&s;ers of the crown compared the principles of the Abhorrers to tho&s;e of the wild Iri&s;h.</P>

He told them, as they had lately &s;een, and were likely to &s;ee again, que&s;tions &s;tarted of &s;o high a nature, and to him particularly of &s;o great concern, it was agreeable both to rea&s;on and ju&s;tice that he &s;hould be pre&s;ent at the next &s;e&s;|&s;ion of parliament.

He behaved him&s;elf with dignity, without any portion of that &s;tateline&s;s, which was, in his pro&s;perity, one of the defects in his character.

The Earls of Sali&s;bury and E&s;&s;ex, together with the Lord Howard of E&s;cric, &s;econded this motion. Halifax and others oppo&s;ed it; and the whole fell, without ef|fect, to the ground.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Halifax's expedient.</NOTE> The bill propo&s;ed by Halifax, though it pre&s;erved the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, annihilated the power of the crown. The Duke of York was to have been bani&s;hed, during the King's life, five hundred miles from England. He was to forfeit his revenue, if he came nearer; and his life, if he returned to any part of his Maje&s;ty's do|minions. In this clau&s;e, the independence of Scotland, which kingdom had certainly a right, if &s;he cho&s;e, to entertain the heir of her crown, was either neglected or forgotten, through the vivacity of Halifax. Who|ever &s;hould receive the Duke, either in England or Ireland, was to be declared guilty of trea&s;on, even after his acce&s;&s;ion to the nominal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne. The whole government was to have been ve&s;ted in a council of forty-one members. All foreign treaties and negotiations were to be concluded or tran&s;acted by commi&s;&s;ioners cho&s;en out of their own number by the

This part of their power was &s;ubjected to the control and di&s;allowance of parliament, which, when &s;itting, was to exerci&s;e all the authority ve&s;ted in the council, during the interval of &s;e&s;&s;ions. It is difficult to &s;ay why Shafte&s;bury rejected an expedient which &s;eemed to an&s;wer all his own views. Sidney, and other men of republican principles, ju&s;tly termed the propo&s;ed bill <Q REND="inline">"a gentle way of dropping the go|vernment into a commonwealth<NOTE N="U" PLACE="foot">James II. 1680.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Re&s;entment of the com|mons.</NOTE> The rejecting the bill of exclu&s;ion threw the com|mons into the utmo&s;t fury.

This mea&s;ure was deemed imprudent in the hou&s;e, and uncon&s;titu|tional in it&s;elf. It was animadverting upon the free|dom of debate, without which public a&s;&s;embles meet in vain. They &s;eemed them&s;elves to be &s;en&s;ible of their error, though their pa&s;&s;ions overcame, in this in|&s;tance, their rea&s;on. The cau&s;e which they a&s;&s;igned for their addre&s;s was Halifax's advi&s;ing the late frequent prorogations of parliament. Though no friend of the Duke, he had certainly taken an active part again&s;t the bill, before it was &s;ent up to the lords. He pro|cured a me&s;&s;age to the commons, to de&s;troy a report propagated by the popular party, that the King had con&s;ented to the bill. To this circum&s;tance the fa|vourers of the exclu&s;ion were no &s;trangers. Be&s;ides Halifax had always affected to adopt their principles; and they per&s;ecuted him with virulence, as a betrayer of his political friends. Charles, in an&s;wer to their addre&s;s, acquainted the hou&s;e, that he found no &s;uf|ficient ground to induce him to remove Halifax either from his councils or pre&s;ence; but he promi&s;ed to protect none of his &s;ervants in the commi&s;&s;ion of any real crime<NOTE N="Y" PLACE="foot">Nov. 26.</NOTE>.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ob&s;erva|tions.</NOTE> The fury of the commons, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, was in &s;ome re&s;pects unju&s;tifiable. But, however, they voted &s;everal re&s;olutions and pa&s;&s;ed a few laws ex|tremely favourable to public freedom. Their &s;elf-de|nying vote, though perhaps impracticable, was high|ly &s;uitable to the independence of parliament. The bill for rendering the judges independent tended to keep pure the current of public ju&s;tice. The act for repealing the &s;tatute of the thirty fifth of Elizabeth, for giving ea&s;e to Prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters, bore the ap|pearance of a liberality in matters of religion that &s;eldom di&s;tingui&s;hes popular a&s;&s;emblies. But this bill owed its exi&s;tence more to the aver&s;ion of the po|pular party to the Papi&s;ts, than their lenity to Pro|te&s;tant non-conformi&s;ts. Shafte&s;bury freely owned, in the hou&s;e of lords, that he wi&s;hed all di&s;&s;enters who &s;hould &s;ub&s;cribe the te&s;t might be exempted from taking the oath of allegiance. A great debate aro&s;e on the &s;ubject. All the bi&s;hops oppo&s;ed the bill. It was carried in a committee of the whole hou&s;e, that the oath of allegiance &s;hould remain on the fa|natics as well as on the Roman catholics. The op|po&s;ition, after this amendment, became indifferent about the bill. The King, however, thought it too favourable to &s;ectaries. Though he had endeavour|ed, by his prerogative, to grant to them an irregu|lar indulgence, &s;ome years before, he was unwilling to &s;ecure them by an act of the legi&s;lature. The violence with which the pre&s;byterians joined the prin|ciples of the exclu&s;ioni&s;ts, had given him much of|fence. Be&s;ides, the e&s;tabli&s;hed church had exhibited, in &s;ome late in&s;tances, proofs of attachment which de&s;erved to be cheri&s;hed. He re&s;olved to defeat the act. But the means which he u&s;ed were neither &s;pi|rited nor prudent.

In the la&s;t parliament, after the bill of exclu&s;ion had pa&s;&s;ed the commons, little oppo&s;ition was made to the mo&s;t extravagant propo&s;itions of the country party.

The more profligate part of the oppo&s;ition in parlia|ment were in her pay; and her amba&s;&s;ador at Lon|don employed her money in procuring malicious libels, to alienate the affections of his people from the King<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. He received, for this purpo&s;e, into his &s;ervice one Fitz-Harris, an Iri&s;hman and a Roman catholic<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. This man, being the &s;on of Sir Edward Fitz-Harris, a con|&s;picuous royali&s;t; had found means, &s;ome time before, to be admitted to the King, who gave him two hun|dred and fifty pounds to extricate him from his ne|ce&s;&s;ities. This being only a temporary relief, he hearkened with eagerne&s;s to the propo&s;als of the am|ba&s;&s;ador of France. Being him&s;elf unable to write for the public, he applied to one Everard, a Scot&s;man, who had been an informer, and a partizan to the po|pular party, to frame the libel. Everard, afraid of a de&s;ign to trepan him&s;elf, placed &s;ecretly the witne&s;&s;es, Sir William Waller, a noted ju&s;tice of the peace, and two other per&s;ons, behind the hangings, to hear what pa&s;&s;ed between him and Fitz-Harris.

he al&s;o became a di&s;coverer of the great Popi&s;h plot. Corni&s;h having informed Charles of this cir|cum&s;tance, the two &s;ecretaries were &s;ent to examine Fitz-Harris. He &s;aid, that Montecuculli, who had been envoy in England from the court of Modena, had offered him ten thou&s;and pounds for murdering the King. He refu&s;ed the offer; but he told him, that the King's death might be procured by poi&s;on, at the Duche&s;s of Mazarine's hou&s;e. He accu&s;ed the Duke of York of being privy to the whole de&s;ign. He affirmed, that an army from France and Flanders was to &s;upport that prince; and that many parliament men, who had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves for the bill of exclu&s;ion, were to be boiled to death, to make a kind of oil<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">St. Ampoule.

The King &s;aw the de|&s;ign of this incoherent non&s;en&s;e; and, being appre|hen&s;ive that parliament would apply for a pardon for Fitz-Harris, he i&s;&s;ued a &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion of oyer and terminer for his trial; but the parliament met be|fore it was carried into execution.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its effect on the Duke of York.</NOTE> Incredible, however, as the tale of Fitz-Harris ap|peared, it intimidated tho&s;e who wi&s;hed to favour the Duke of York.

An informality in the mode of proceeding furni&s;hed the Duke with a pretence to appear after proclama|tion; but that was neither &s;afe nor practicable.

Another body of his guards were ordered to patrole along the way. The oppo&s;ition of his family rendered colonel Ru&s;&s;el &s;u&s;|pected. His regiment was offered to the Earl of Thanet. The Duke of York recommended Mulgrave to the &s;ame command. The fir&s;t declined to pay for his commi&s;&s;ion to Ru&s;&s;el. The King him&s;elf refu&s;ed the latter, from a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again&s;t his manner. The Earl of Craven, though then &s;uperannuated, was left in the chief command<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Having made the&s;e arrangements, Charles left Wind&s;or on the fourteenth of March. He was received on the confines of the county by the high &s;heriff; and at Wheatley by Lord Norris, the lord-lieutenant, and conducted with great pomp to Oxford. The univer&s;ity expre&s;&s;ed their loyalty in addre&s;&s;es and fe&s;tivity; and the King was &s;o well plea&s;ed with his reception, that he ordered the particulars to be publi&s;hed, as an example of fidelity to the re&s;t of the kingdom. The popular party came with equal pomp, and &s;carce with le&s;s ho&s;tile prepara|tions, to Oxford. Numerous bands of retainers in arms attended their leaders to parliament. Great multitudes, in particular, followed the four members for the city of London<NOTE N="R" PLACE="foot">Kennet, et Auct. citat.</NOTE>.

The commons knew, that the court was bent upon the conviction of the criminal.

He drew the cur|tains as he went, to conceal the crown, which he car|ried on his knee. The lords &s;u&s;pected nothing, as he was wont to come daily to hear their debates. When he arrived, he &s;uddenly mounted the throne; and placing the crown on his head, ordered the u&s;her of the black-rod to &s;ummon the commons. Silence and a&s;toni&s;hment prevailed around. His very &s;ervants &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed at a conduct which they might have fore&s;een. The commons, in the mean time, arrived. The King told them, <Q REND="inline">"that divi&s;ions, which began

They found that they had built too much on the ea&s;ine&s;s of Charles; and that they had mi&s;taken his forbearing policy for timidity. The fabric of oppo&s;ition, which they had been rearing for &s;everal years, melted at once into air. A melancholy &s;ilence followed their vehement eloquence; and all their &s;pirit took its flight with their good fortune. Fears for them&s;elves &s;ucceeded to their violence again&s;t the crown. They had lo&s;t the field to a prince whom they, with every art, had offended and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and they dreaded that he would u&s;e his victory with rigour; and they were not deceived. They ha&s;tened each to his own home, as if terrified at the place where they had lo&s;t their political con&s;equence. All the roads were in an in&s;tant covered with carriages and hor&s;es. The King him&s;elf, as afraid of &s;ome attempt of their de&s;pair, ha&s;tened in his coach to Wind&s;or, attended by his guards, and the next day he came to Whitehall.</P>

Some able an&s;wers, however, appeared again&s;t the King's declaration; but they made little impre&s;&s;ion on a people who&s;e opi|nions had changed. The adherents of the court car|ried their arguments to the pre&s;s. Men of genius, though little encouraged by the monarch, aided his councils with their talents. Sir William Jones, a man of abilities, who had re&s;igned the office of attor|ney-general to join the country party, defended the late parliaments, as much as their conduct would ad|mit of defence. He expo&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s the mea&s;ures of Charles; but no &s;ufficient excu&s;e could be made for the imprudent vehemence of his own friends. To complete the victory of the crown, the people were en|couraged to approve publicly of the di&s;&s;olution of par|liament. Addre&s;&s;es poured from every quarter of the kingdom. This &s;pecies of flattery was begun by the ju&s;tices of the peace for the county of Middle&s;ex<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">April 18.</NOTE>; and from them it &s;pread to almo&s;t all the legal &s;ocieties in the nation. Even apprentices, watermen, and ma|riners, joined in the univer&s;al cry in favour of the crown. Men in general &s;eemed to congratulate the King on his e&s;cape from parliaments, and to be impa|tient to throw the burden of public freedom at the foot of the throne.</P>

When application was made by &s;ome citizens for an addre&s;s, others carried, by a majority in the common-hall, a vote for a peti|tion. Charles commanded the Earl of Nottingham, as chancellor, to return an an&s;wer, at once contemp|tuous and &s;evere. He reprimanded them for interfer|ing in affairs of &s;tate, being things totally beyond their &s;phere. He averred, that the meane&s;t village in England had an equal right with them to meddle in matters of government. He de&s;ired them to con&s;ider, that the common-council of London was by no means the common-council of the nation. He, however, informed them, that his Maje&s;ty looked not upon their petition as proceeding from the unanimous con&s;ent of the city of London; that it was carried only by four|teen votes in the whole; and that it was again&s;t the &s;en&s;e of the greater part of the court of aldermen.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Intrigues of the Prince of Orange. June.</NOTE> While the King was preparing, with a degree of &s;pirit, to di&s;comfit the popular &s;action, the Prince of Orange was bu&s;y in forming projects of ambition upon their expected &s;ucce&s;s. Notwith&s;tanding the re|pul&s;e given to the Dutch memorial, he adopted other &s;chemes to favour his views on the throne. He came to a re&s;olution with his party to propo&s;e a new expe|dient to the King of England. The projected mar|riage between the Bi&s;hop of O&s;naburgh and the Prin|ce&s;s Anne had not hitherto been laid a&s;ide in the &s;ecret councils of the Prince. He, therefore, intended to demand, in conjunction with the oppo&s;ition in parlia|ment, that in ca&s;e Charles &s;hould did before the Duke

of York, the latter &s;hould be only titular King, and re&s;ide in the dominions of the Duke of Hanover; and that his &s;ons-in-law, the Prince him&s;elf, and the Bi|&s;hop of O&s;naburgh, &s;hould be declared regents of the kingdom. This project, however, was dropt, as ab&s;urd, upon mature con&s;ideration; and the Prince turned his attention to another &s;cheme, which ulti|mately crowned his de&s;igns with &s;ucce&s;s. He concert|ed with the Earl of Sunderland to make a &s;hew of de|&s;erting his intere&s;t, to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into the inti|macy of the Duche&s;s of Port&s;mouth, and, by her means, into the good graces of his ma&s;ter, that he might have an opportunity of betraying the councils of that Prince, and defeat the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Duke of York to the throne of England<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">D'Avaux, April 1681.</NOTE>.</P>

His conviction being deemed a mat|ter of the la&s;t importance to the crown, &s;ome extra|ordinary preparations were made. The lord chief ju&s;tice Scroggs lay him&s;elf under an impeachment in parliament; and it was thought improper that one delinquent &s;hould &s;it in judgment upon another of the &s;ame kind. He was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his office with a pen&s;ion. Pemberton, a man of boldne&s;s, and better abilities than character, &s;ucceeded Scroggs. The&s;e precautions were, however, unnece&s;&s;ary. Though the principal witne&s;s, Sir William Waller, was him|&s;elf a violent party-man; though John&s;on, the fore|man of the jury, had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf as a parti|zan of Shafte&s;bury, and an adherent of Monmouth; though the &s;heriffs had cho&s;en the re&s;t of the jury, on account of their popular principles; the fact was too clear to admit of his e&s;cape. The only plea was his being employed by the King in &s;ecret &s;ervices. The Duche&s;s of Port&s;mouth, being examined, &s;wore that the begged &s;ome charity for him from the King, but that &s;he was privy to none of his concerns. Her woman, Mrs. Wall, was al&s;o called. She declared

that Fitz-Harris received one hundred and fifty or two hundred pounds for per&s;uading &s;ome eminent per|&s;ons in oppo&s;ition to &s;upport the intere&s;t of the King<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">James II. 1681.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and execut|ed.</NOTE> Fitz-Harris, being condemned for trea&s;on, endea|voured to &s;ave his life by &s;oothing the King. He &s;ent a me&s;&s;age, that &s;hould his &s;entence be changed to per|petual impri&s;onment, he would openly name tho&s;e who induced him to accu&s;e the Queen, the Duke of York, and the Earl of Danby<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. He was examined before the council. He affirmed, that the two &s;he|riffs, Bethel and Corni&s;h, together with Treby the recorder, had prevailed with him to invent the fictions concerning the Popi&s;h plot. He was, however, too profligate to gain any credit to his evidence. He ac|cu&s;ed the Lord Howard of E&s;cric of being concerned in the libel for which he was condemned. His wife and maid confirmed this part of the te&s;timony; and Howard was immediately &s;ent to the Tower. But, notwith&s;tanding di&s;coveries which could not but plea&s;e the King, Fitz-Harris was too obnoxious to be par|doned. He, however, continued to the la&s;t to adhere to the fal&s;ehood of his accu&s;ation; and he declared at the place of execution, <Q REND="inline">"that he renounced the mer|cy of Almighty God, if his confe&s;&s;ion was not true<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">Vid. his Confe&s;&s;ion.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plunket condemned.</NOTE> Though Fitz-Harris died unpitied, the fate of ano|ther &s;uppo&s;ed criminal of the &s;ame faith, was lamented by the unprejudiced few. Shafte&s;bury, to enlarge the &s;cale of the popular plot, had encouraged and &s;upported informers, who endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h a belief of an Iri&s;h con&s;piracy of the &s;ame kind. Some profligate prie&s;ts, who wi&s;hed to gain the reward of|fered in England for perjury, had &s;ome time before accu&s;ed Oliver Plunket, the Popi&s;h titular bi&s;hop of Armagh, who called him&s;elf primate of all Ireland. Plunket was a man remarkable for the &s;implicity of his manners, quiet in his di&s;po&s;ition, and altogether an enemy to turbulence and intrigue. He was, how|ever, brought to England to take his trial. The wit|ne&s;&s;es, as u&s;ual, were incredible in their evidence.
<PB N="328" REF="350">
They &s;wore, that he had engaged to the Pope to rai&s;e &s;ixty thou&s;and Iri&s;h to join an army of French in|vaders, to de&s;troy the Prote&s;tant religion. The Iri&s;h clergy, they affirmed, were to &s;upport with their con|tributions this de&s;ign. Plunket, in defence, could only urge the improbability of this tale. He &s;hewed that the Iri&s;h clergy were &s;o poor, that he him&s;elf, who was called their primate, lived in a thatched hut upon &s;ixty pounds a year. He in&s;i&s;ted upon the ob|vious &s;al&s;ehood, that a body of men labouring under &s;uch poverty, could furni&s;h money for the &s;upport of a great army. The evidence, however, was po&s;itive. Plunket was condemned; and the King, though in|formed of his innocence, dur&s;t not pardon &s;o &s;ignal a Papi&s;t<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">Contin. of Baker.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tran&s;ac|tions in the city.</NOTE> While the re&s;t of the nation &s;ignified their appro|bation of the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures in addre&s;&s;es, the cor|poration of London &s;eemed to adhere to their former principles. On the twenty-fourth of June, the two &s;heriffs were cho&s;en from the popular party; and the common-hall voted their a&s;&s;ent to the matter of the petition, for which the city had been reprimanded by the King. The addre&s;s of Shafte&s;bury was the chief cau&s;e of this ob&s;tinacy. Having employed agents of the inferior &s;ort of people to keep up the flame, he contrived to carry the election of &s;heriffs; a nece&s;&s;ary precaution, when his enemies &s;eemed determined to execute their vengeance through the channel of the law. Too artful him&s;elf to commit obvious trea&s;on, the court re&s;olved to puni&s;h his adherents. Two of his mo&s;t active managers, College and Rou&s;e, were apprehended by a warrant from the council. The fir&s;t was a trade&s;man of &s;ome character, but a fana|tic; and the latter had been employed in conducting and &s;upporting the evidence for an Iri&s;h plot; the mo&s;t fooli&s;h, and to his party the mo&s;t fatal, of all that nobleman's political &s;chemes<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Kennet, Ralph, et Auct. citat.</NOTE>.</P>

On the eighth of July, a bill was preferred again&s;t him; but the jury returned it indor&s;ed with an ignoramus.
<PB N="329" REF="351">
The intemperate joy of the party upon this occa&s;ion increa&s;ed the re&s;entment of the adherents of the crown. Though the bill in Middle&s;ex was fru&s;trated, College was &s;till liable to another in the county of Oxford. A part of the trea&s;on of which he was ac|cu&s;ed lay in the latter county; and the King might le|gally pro&s;ecute in either, as &s;uited his plea&s;ure. The a&s;&s;izes at Oxford were at hand. The pri&s;oner was &s;ent to that place. The indictment was preferred to the ordinary grand jury, and a bill was found. But it was thought neither ju&s;t nor politic to try him dur|ing the &s;ame a&s;&s;izes. On the &s;eventeenth of Augu&s;t, a &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion of oyer and terminer was i&s;&s;ued to the Lord Norris, as lord lieutenant of the county of Oxford, the lord chief ju&s;tice North, and the pui&s;ne judges, Jones, Raymond, and Levinz, for the trial of College. The activity of the pri&s;oner in the &s;ervice of his party had rai&s;ed him to a degree of importance, to which his &s;ituation in life had other|wi&s;e no claim<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">Publications of the year.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and con|demned.</NOTE> Dugdale, Turberville, and Smith, who had di&s;tin|gui&s;hed them&s;elves in their evidence for the Popi&s;h plot, were now the principal witne&s;&s;es again&s;t Col|lege. Having left the popular party when their power declined, they offered their &s;ervice to the court, and they were readily received. A &s;pirit of retaliation, which overcame all the principles of ju&s;tice, had, to the di&s;grace of the age, &s;eized the adherents of the crown. Though they &s;aw with indignation the per|juries of tho&s;e villains, when employed by their ene|mies, they now availed them&s;elves of their te&s;timony to favour their revenge. The chief charge again&s;t College was, that, in his zeal for the exclu&s;ioni&s;ts, he had appeared at Oxford, during the &s;itting of par|liament, armed with &s;word and pi&s;tol; and that he had expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to &s;ome of the witne&s;&s;es as being engaged in a con&s;piracy to &s;eize the per&s;on of the King<NOTE N="R" PLACE="foot">Grey's Hi&s;tory of the Rye-hou&s;e plot.</NOTE>.

in the city of London, he &s;eems never to have extended his thoughts to actual trea&s;on. It is remarkable, that College, in the ca&s;e of the Vi&s;count Stafford, had much in&s;i&s;ted on the hone&s;ty of Dugdale; yet the apparent perjury of that evidence bore now the harde&s;t on him|&s;elf. Notwith&s;tanding his defence, he was found guilty; and his &s;entence was heard with &s;houts of applau&s;e by a great concourfe of &s;pectators.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Scotland.</NOTE> Notwith&s;tanding the great and &s;udden change in favour of the crown in England, Charles thought it prudent to command the Duke of York to remain in Scotland. The politic conduct of that Prince, during his former re&s;idence in the latter kingdom, had gained the good opinion of the Scots, and &s;ecured their attach|ment. The violence of his enemies, and that pity which follows misfortune in the higher &s;pheres of life, were, however, more favourable to his intere&s;t than his own conduct. The attention paid to him in Scot|land prevented not his impatience to return to court, when he heard of the di&s;&s;olution of parliament. He applied by letter to Charles. He &s;ent Churchill, his favourite, to London. He employed all the influence of his friends. The latter contented them&s;elves with reque&s;ting that he him&s;elf might be permitted to re&s;ide at Audley, or any other hou&s;e belonging to the King; and that the Duche&s;s, who was in a bad &s;tate of health, might retire either to Bath or Tunbridge. Hyde and Jenkins, of all the mini&s;try, wi&s;hed only for his return. The re&s;t, with the Duche&s;s of Port&s;mouth, oppo&s;ed it, and prevailed<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">James II. 1681.</NOTE>.</P>

This was a de&s;ire to call a parliament in Scotland, where, from the complexion of opinions, the Duke flattered him&s;elf with the hopes of a &s;olemn act to recognize the rights of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which had been invaded in England. Charles readily

agreed; and, thinking it unfit that any other &s;hould repre&s;ent his per&s;on when his brother was pre&s;ent, ap|pointed the Duke his commi&s;&s;ioner to the new parlia|ment. The proclamation and letter to the privy-coun|cil of Scotland were not, however, di&s;patched from London till the end of July. When the parliament met at Edinburgh, the Duke found that he had formed a ju&s;t judgment of their attachment to the indefea&s;ible rights of monarchy. An act was immediately pa&s;&s;ed, <Q REND="inline">"that no difference of religion, no act of the legi&s;lature made or to be made, could alter or divert the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, or lineal de&s;cent of the crown."</Q> It was declared high trea&s;on in any one of the &s;ubjects of Scotland, by writing or acting, by word or deed, to endeavour the alteration or &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Foreign af|fairs.</NOTE> The ambition of Lewis the Fourteenth, encouraged by the di&s;&s;en&s;ions in England, began again to threaten Europe with a war. To give the colour of ju&s;tice to his conduct, he formed at Metz a court, which he called the Sovereign Chamber, to e&s;tabli&s;h a kind of claim to the territories which he meant to &s;eize. This iniquitous tribunal declared<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">April 12, 1680</NOTE>, that the greate&s;t part of the duchy of Luxembourg was a dependence on the bi&s;hoprick of Metz, which had been ceded by treaty to the crown of France.

The ambition of the Prince of Orange added its own force to the terror and re&s;entment of Spain and Holland. While he was in appearance on the be&s;t terms with his uncle, he concerted with the Spaniards, that a declaration &s;hould be pre&s;ented by their own amba&s;&s;ador at London, &s;ignifying that his nation would break all commerce with England, till the King &s;hould reconcile him&s;elf to his parliament<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">D'Avaux, December 1681.</NOTE>.

They knew that his ambition had been vio|lently inflamed by the near pro&s;pect of the Engli&s;h throne, furni&s;hed to him by the exclu&s;ion of the Duke of York.

The &s;upply promi&s;ed by Lewis enabled the King of England to di&s;mi&s;s his violent commons, and to reject what HE deemed the in&s;olent demands of his allies.

Charles being highly offended at this mark of di&s;re&s;pect, the Prince referred at length Sidney's affair to his plea|&s;ure.

The taking of Stra&s;bourg in the month of September, the continuation of the blockade of Luxembourg, the other claims and expected en|croachments of France, continued the fears of Europe. The Spaniards made many fruitle&s;s applications to the King of England; they applied in vain to the Dutch. The Emperor, over-awed and threatened by the Ot|tomans, harra&s;&s;ed by a rebellion in Hungary, de&s;ert|ed by &s;ome of the German princes, de&s;titute of re|&s;ources, and feeble in his own councils, could neither a&s;&s;i&s;t his allies, nor protect him&s;elf. The States, urged by the Prince of Orange and the Spaniards, forced by their nece&s;&s;ities, made repeated applications to Charles for the calling of a parliament. Even &s;ome of his own mini&s;ters joined in the &s;olicitations of foreign amba&s;&s;adors. He, however, was neither to be convinced by argument, nor gained by entreaty. He fore&s;aw that he could expect nothing from the com|mons but a reiteration of their former demands; and he was extremely unwilling to give fre&s;h force to a par|ty upon the point of being totally &s;ubdued. Be&s;ides, he &s;ound that the Dutch, attached to their own com|merce and partly gained by the intrigues of France, wi&s;hed to make England a principal in the war.&mdash;They had in&s;i&s;ted upon his taking the fir&s;t &s;tep; which he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed; though he gave in&s;tructions to his amba&s;&s;ador at Paris to join in all the remon&s;trances of the States.</P>

The Duke, though he knew that the tran&s;action could not be rendered valid without an act of parliament, gra&s;p|ed at the propo&s;al, as the only means of his return.

He pre&s;&s;ed for his immediate return to Scotland; but Charles, to &s;atisfy the Duche&s;s of Port&s;mouth, furni&s;hed him with a pretence of coming to London. The attor|ney-general was ordered to prepare a deed, to be &s;ign|ed by the Duke of York; but, at the end of two days, he informed the King, that no &s;ettlement could be made without an act of parliament. It is re|markable, that the noted Jefferys was the lawyer who &s;ugge&s;ted the expedient to the King. The Duke excu&s;es his own want of &s;incerity, in not undeceiving his brother, by his having lo&s;t all other hopes of be|ing ever permitted to return from what he calls an honourable exile. He remained two months with the King. During that time he fortified his intere&s;t &s;o well, that he was permitted to go to Scotland for the Duche&s;s and his family; and, after his return, to fix his re&s;idence in London. He even gained the con&s;ent of Halifax, by promi&s;ing not to interfere openly in public affairs, till the opinions of mankind &s;hould be more &s;ettled, after the late change. His reception from the people convinced the Duke, that their prejudices again&s;t him had vani&s;hed.

Ju&s;t as the Glouce&s;ter was ready to di&s;appear, the Duke of York was received into the yacht. The per&s;ons left, in all about one hundred in number, gave a loud &s;hout when they &s;aw him &s;afe: a mark that they had an affection for his per&s;on; and that he had not preferred, as &s;ome writers affirm<NOTE N="Y" PLACE="foot">Burnet.</NOTE>, the &s;afety of his prie&s;ts and dogs to the lives of the &s;eamen.

Hyde, the Duke's brother-in-law, was the only Engli&s;hman of rank and quality among the number.

The progre&s;s of the crown, in &s;upporting its power and puni&s;hing its enemies, through the channel of the law, was greatly checked by juries cho&s;en by adver&s;e &s;heriffs. In recent ca&s;es, they had acquitted per&s;ons whom the court-party had con&s;idered as guilty of crimes of the deepe&s;t dye; and the populace, with their u&s;ual intem|perance, followed their victory with in&s;ult. To di&s;|lodge the faction from their &s;trong hold in the city, was an object of importance; but the means by which it was pur&s;ued were irregular, if not criminal. Sir John Moore, the lord-mayor, from principle an ene|my to popular confu&s;ions, accommodated him&s;elf, upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, to the views of the crown. On the twenty-fourth of June the new &s;heriffs were to be cho&s;en, according to annual cu&s;tom.

When, therefore, the common-hall met on that day, North was put up only for confir|mation, as being already duly elected by the lord-mayor. The majority of the common-hall &s;till in&s;i&s;t|ed upon their right of electing two &s;heriffs. Two books for two different polls were opened; one by Pilkington and Shute, another by the lord mayor. The latter came upon the hu&s;tings, and declared the election to have fallen on Box. The affair, however, was not fini&s;hed. Box declined the office, and paid his fine. The lord-mayor opened a &s;econd time the books.

Wild and impracticable as this plan &s;eemed, that ambitious woman had turned her views that way. The Earl of Sunderland had, in concert with the Prince of Orange, re&s;olved to pay his court to her vanity and avarice.

Some, who entered with eagerne&s;s into the pro&s;ecution again&s;t the city of London, on account of the delinquency of the members of the corporation, began, when too late, to perceive their error. In puni&s;hing the noi&s;y in&s;olence of a few citizens, they opened a door to other evils of a more permanent and dangerous kind. But the flame kindled between parties had a&s;|cended to &s;uch a height, that men became carele&s;s of their own &s;afety, could they but humble and ruin their opponents.<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">Publications of the times.</NOTE>.</P>

their principal adherents were at the &s;ame time pro&s;e|cuted. Con&s;iderable fines were impo&s;ed upon them all, after a long trial before Sanders, lord chief-ju&s;tice of the King's-Bench. In the mean time, Dubois and Pa|pillon, who claimed a right of being the legal &s;heriffs, arre&s;ted Sir William Pritchard, lord mayor, the two &s;heriffs, and &s;everal aldermen. Though the common council publicly di&s;approved of this mea&s;ure<NOTE N="U" PLACE="foot">May 28.</NOTE>, its vio|lence ha&s;tened the judgment upon the writ of <HI>quo war|ranto</HI> again&s;t the city of London. The arre&s;t was deem|ed by the adherents of the crown &s;uch an outrageous deed, that many citizens of that party urged the court to ha&s;ten the &s;eizure of franchi&s;es, already rendered in|effectual by the violence of a factious party. This con|&s;ideration, more than any fears from the judgment, prevailed with the majority of the common-council to &s;urrender their charter, by a voluntary deed, on the eighteenth of June.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ri&s;e</NOTE> While the adherents of the court made &s;uch progre&s;s in e&s;tabli&s;hing the authority of the crown, the whole fabric of government was undermined by a &s;ecret con|&s;piracy, which had been long forming by the oppo&s;ite party. The facility with which Charles had given up every capital point to the commons, during almo&s;t twenty years of his reign, had created an opinion, that there was no mea&s;ure, however hard, to which he would not yield. When the bill of exclu&s;ion was rejected by the lords in November, 1680, men perceived that the King was re&s;olved to adhere to the eventual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of his brother to the throne. Tho&s;e who promoted the bill with mo&s;t vehemence began now to fear for them&s;elves. They knew the character of the Duke of York, and they dreaded his vengeance &s;hould he come to the crown. This opinion induced &s;ome of the leaders to li&s;ten to the violent councils of Shafte&s;bury, who &s;eemed re&s;olved to obtain by force from the King what he de&s;paired to gain in a legal way. In a conference with Monmouth and the Lords Ru&s;&s;el and Grey, he endeavoured to per&s;uade them to his purpo&s;e, &s;oon after the bill of exclu&s;ion was rejected, through the per&s;onal influence of the King with the lords. Terrified with the danger of his pro|ject, or &s;urprized at its magnitude, they li&s;tened for
<PB N="354" REF="378">
&s;ome time to Shafte&s;bury's propo&s;als without giving their a&s;&s;ent: but an unexpected event induced them at once to embark in his de&s;perate de&s;igns.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and pro|gre&s;s</NOTE> In the month of February, 1681, the King was &s;eiz|ed at Wind&s;or with a &s;udden illne&s;s. The news was immediately carried to the Duke of Monmouth, at Lon|don. He communicated the intelligence to Shafte&s;bury and Ru&s;&s;el. In a conference, at which Sir Thomas Arm&s;trong, Monmouth's bo&s;om friend, was pre&s;ent, it was agreed, that an in&s;urrection &s;hould be procured among the malecontents in the city, in ca&s;e of the King's death. The project of the con&s;pirators was to ri&s;e with their friends, to call a parliament, to &s;ettle the kingdom, to declare the de&s;cent of the crown; and to continue in arms, for their own &s;ecurity, till the&s;e points &s;hould be obtained and their enemies &s;ubdued. The King's recovery broke for the pre&s;ent their mea&s;ures. The new parliament &s;oon after met at Oxford; and the party changed the mode of their con&s;piracy, and tran&s;|ferred it to that place. They formed a &s;cheme not to &s;uffer the parliament to be di&s;&s;olved; and determined to adjourn to the Guild-hall at London, when they &s;hould find that a di&s;&s;olution was nigh. The precaution of Charles, in placing his guards on the road to Oxford, induced them to change a re&s;olution which might be at|tended with peril; and they at la&s;t agreed to encourage as many as po&s;&s;ible of the lords and members of the lower hou&s;e to continue to &s;it after the King &s;hould di&s;|&s;olve the parliament.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">of a con|&s;piracy.</NOTE> The addre&s;s of the King prevented al&s;o this violent &s;cheme. He concealed with &s;uch art his re&s;olution to di&s;&s;olve the parliament, that the &s;uddenne&s;s of the mea|&s;ure di&s;concerted all their de&s;igns. Shafte&s;bury, with &s;ome other lords, remained an hour in the hou&s;e after the King's departure, under a pretence of &s;igning a pro|te&s;t. But when they &s;ent to the hou&s;e of commons, all the members were gone. Time was only wanting to accompli&s;h their wild and dangerous plan. To unite the popular party in one de&s;ign, the principal con&s;pirators convened them frequently to entertainments. The Duke of Monmouth, the Earls of Bedford, Maccle&s;|field, and E&s;&s;ex, kept open table. Grey only, of the whole junto, thought the de&s;ign impracticable. The King was provided with a military force. But it was
<PB N="355" REF="379">
an&s;wered, that the inhabitants of Oxford were well af|fected to the party. The &s;tudents of the univer&s;ity were, Grey affirmed, well affected to the King. Shafte&s;bury replied, that they had left their chambers to accommo|date the members. He added, that among the foot|guards there were many friends; and he ob&s;erved, that many of their party were attended with armed retainers. He con&s;idered not that the judgement of the nation would turn in&s;tantly again&s;t an illegal parliament; and that terror, which generally accompanies a con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of being in the wrong, would inevitably &s;ubdue the party in their own minds.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">former</NOTE> The di&s;appointment at Oxford di&s;concerted, for &s;ome time, the mea&s;ures of the party. Shafte&s;bury the life and &s;oul of the con&s;piracy, &s;pent the mo&s;t of the &s;um|mer of 1681 in fortifying his influence in the city of London. On the &s;econd of July, he was, upon the oaths of his own Iri&s;h evidence, committed to the Tower, where he continued to the la&s;t day of November. The Earl of Argyle applied to him, in his impri&s;onment, for thirty thou&s;and, and afterwards only for fifteen thou&s;and pounds, to be collected by the party for &s;upporting an in&s;urrec|tion in Scotland. Argyle was &s;u&s;pected, and nothing done. When the King determined, by irregular means, to po&s;|&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of the elections of London at Mid&s;ummer 1682, the zeal of the party, which had langui&s;hed, be|gan to be rouzed again by their fears. Meetings were held by the leaders. Ru&s;&s;el, in particular, re&s;olved &s;e|riou&s;ly to apply to an in&s;urrection. He founded Sir William Courtney, Sir Francis Rolls, and Sir Francis Drake, all men of weight and influence in their re&s;pec|tive counties. Monmouth, under the pretence of plea|&s;ure, made a progre&s;s to Che&s;hire, to confirm the Earl of Macclesfield and the Lord Delemere. Shafte&s;bury re|mained in town, to inflame to action the citizens of Lon|don. When Monmouth returned, he rai&s;ed the hopes of his party, by a relation of his &s;ucce&s;s in the we&s;t; and he engaged Trenchard, and obtained his promi&s;e, at an appointed time to rai&s;e fifteen hundred men in Taunton and the adjacent country.</P>

dangerous. Their difference in opinion produced a de|claration of their re&s;pective de&s;igns. Shafte&s;bury was for a republic; Ru&s;&s;el only for a limited monarchy. The lat|ter having communicated the &s;chemes of the former to Monmouth, who a&s;pired to the throne, the con&s;piracy was near being ruined with jealou&s;y. In the mean time, the adherents of the party in the country were cold and undeci&s;ive. Sir William Courtney &s;ent a doubtful an&s;wer. Trenchard demanded delay. At a meeting of the lead|ers with &s;ome inferior con&s;pirators, they determined to join with Shafte&s;bury, and to ri&s;e in London. A day at length was appointed. Trenchard was to be di&s;patch|ed to the country, to an&s;wer the time. A me&s;&s;age was &s;ent to Courtney. Arms were provided in different places. Three field-pieces were bought by Shafte&s;bury. Monmouth &s;urveyed the guards, and found them remi&s;s. Their &s;tations were appointed to each. When every thing was &s;ettled, Monmouth communicated the whole to Trenchard, who &s;eemed terrified, and demanded three weeks to prepare for the in&s;urrection at Taunton. A declaration was in the mean time prepared. The con|&s;pirators &s;eemed only to re&s;t on their arms in London, and to wait for the ri&s;ing of their friends in the country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">of the</NOTE> During this awful &s;u&s;pen&s;e, the timid Trenchard de|manded further delay. Shafte&s;bury, by nature impati|ent, and, be&s;ides, rendered re&s;tle&s;s by his fears, could bear no longer the anxiety of his &s;ituation, and retired abroad. Walcot, an Iri&s;h officer, and Fergu&s;on, a Scoti&s;h clergyman, both members of the con&s;piracy, attended him in his flight. They however, left him when he landed in Holland, and returned to their friends. He died of the gout in the &s;tomach, &s;ix weeks after his ar|rival at Am&s;terdam. The vehemence of his temper &s;eemed to have increa&s;ed with his years. Soured by di&s;appointments in his political views, he had become peevi&s;h in his language and imprudent in his mea&s;ures. His very friends at la&s;t had rea&s;on to dread his vio|lence, more than his enemies. The addre&s;s which had attended him in &s;ucce&s;s de&s;erted him in his political mis|fortunes; and his party thought his flight, and even his death, an acce&s;&s;ion of &s;trength to their cau&s;e. The ini|quity of his conduct &s;ince the commencement of the Popi&s;h plot had offended men of principle of his own faction; no wonder that it rai&s;ed the re&s;entment of his

enemies. His timely retreat &s;aved his family from ruin; and his death was fortunate to him&s;elf, as it prevented di&s;grace.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">popular par|ty.</NOTE> His departure di&s;concerted, for the time, the mea|&s;ures of the party. The communication with the heads of the intended in&s;urrection in the city was interrupted by the ab&s;ence of Fergu&s;on, who had chiefly managed the corre&s;pondence between them and the Earl of Shafte&s;|bury. This re&s;tle&s;s plotter, however, &s;oon returned, and opened the former intercour&s;e. Some per&s;ons of emi|nence were now added to the number of the con&s;pira|tors. Algernon Sidney, who, from an aver&s;ion to Shafte&s;|bury, had hitherto declined to join in their con&s;ults, at|tended their meetings and animated their zeal. Hamp|den was al&s;o received more intimately than before into their de&s;igns. The Lord Howard of E&s;cric, a man of profligate manners, was admitted into their mo&s;t &s;ecret councils. To manage their &s;chemes with regularity and preci&s;ion, a council of &s;ix was formed. The&s;e were Monmouth, E&s;&s;ex, Ru&s;&s;el, Howard, Sidney, and Hamp|den. Though all were equally bent upon an in&s;urrec|tion, they were divided in their views. Monmouth, Ru&s;&s;el, and Hampden, aimed at no more than the ef|fectual exclu&s;ion of the Duke of York; E&s;&s;ex, Howard, and Sidney, intended to erect a commonwealth. Not|with&s;tanding this difference in opinion, they all deter|mined to proceed. Trenchard and Courtney were again engaged to ri&s;e in the we&s;t. An in&s;urrection in Scot|land was concerted with the Earl of Argyle. Some of his friends, the Lord Melvin, Sir James Cochran, and others, were de&s;ired to come to London; and the par|ty agreed to furni&s;h them with ten thou&s;and pounds to purcha&s;e ammunition and arms.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An inferior con&s;piracy.</NOTE> The Scots arriving in April, it was &s;oon &s;ettled that Argyle &s;hould ri&s;e, with his adherents, by the end of June. Other arrangements were in the mean time made, and his department a&s;&s;igned to each of the leaders. But, after the whole train was laid, an accident di&s;concert|ed their &s;chemes, and ruined the mo&s;t of them&s;elves. Men of inferior rank, who were nece&s;&s;arily in the &s;e|cret of the intended in&s;urrections, had met often toge|ther and carried on an under-plot to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the King and the Duke of York. This de&s;ign, though not adopt|ed by the council of &s;ix, out of delicacy to Monmouth,
<PB N="358" REF="382">
was approved by &s;ome of the members. Among the le&s;&s;er order of con&s;pirators were We&s;t, a lawyer, at who&s;e chambers they chiefly met; Norton, Ayliffe, and Tyley, men of the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion; Colonel Rum&s;ey, who had &s;erved under Cromwell; Walcot, a republican officer; Goodenough, who had been under-&s;heriff when the city was in the hands of the popular party. Of this num|ber was Fergu&s;on, the Earl of Shafte&s;bury's retainer and agent; Rous, who had e&s;caped two years before by the favour of a jury; Kieling, a &s;alter in London; and one Rumbold, who had &s;erved in the capacity of a &s;ubaltern in Cromwell's army, and now followed the bu&s;ine&s;s of a malt&s;ter at a farm near Hodde&s;don, on the road to Newmarket. To the&s;e were joined the Lord Howard of E&s;cric, a man of a mean di&s;po&s;ition and abandoned cha|racter, nece&s;&s;itous in his circum&s;tances, and hated for his profligacy where he was not de&s;pi&s;ed for his cow|ardice<NOTE N="X" PLACE="foot">Vid.

Zealous for his party, and bold and intrepid in his di&s;po&s;ition, he was the man who arre&s;ted the lord-mayor, at the &s;uit of Papillon and Dubois, the outed &s;heriffs, when no other per&s;on could be found to undertake that dangerous &s;ervice. Repent|ing of this folly, or, as he him&s;elf affirmed, &s;truck with remor&s;e of con&s;cience for his intended crime, he came to Secretary Jenkins on the twelfth of June and di&s;co|vered all he knew. Jenkins took his depo&s;ition; but he told him at the &s;ame time, that without another evidence he could not i&s;&s;ue warrants again&s;t the per&s;ons accu&s;ed. Kieling, by an artifice, engaged his brother in di&s;cour&s;e, upon the &s;chemes of the party, with Goodenough; who, being a man of violent pa&s;&s;ions, ran out in extravagant expre&s;&s;ions of trea&s;on in his detail of their de&s;igns. Jen|kins, fortified by two evidences, laid the affiar before the re&s;t of the mini&s;try, the King being then at Wind|&s;or.

The defence made by the pri&s;oner him&s;elf was feeble and un&s;atisfactory. He prote&s;ted with truth, that he had never entertained even a thought again&s;t the King's life; but his being con|cerned in preparations for an in&s;urrection, he neither af|firmed nor denied. The jury, all men of re&s;pectable characters, brought him in guilty, with little he&s;itation. His former character, his popularity, and the amiable virtues of his private life, created a general regret for his fate. But it does not appear that unfair means were u&s;ed at his trial, or that any part of the proceedings again&s;t him were contrary to the common u&s;age of the law in ca&s;es of trea&s;on.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">behaviour,</NOTE> Though &s;everity was by no means one of the vices of Charles, he re&s;olved to li&s;ten to no reque&s;ts for a pardon. The entreaties of friends, the &s;upplications of a father, the tears of a wife, and even the petition of the unfortunate Lord him&s;elf, were productive of no ef|fect. When his feelings were attempted in vain, ap|plication was made to his nece&s;&s;ities. One hundred thou&s;and pounds were &s;aid to have been offered for Ru&s;|&s;el's life. But money it&s;elf could not purcha&s;e forgive|ne&s;s for a per&s;on who&s;e conduct had &s;o much offend|ed his pride. The very virtues of the criminal had ren|dered his vehement mea&s;ures le&s;s pardonable, as they might have been attended with danger. Ru&s;&s;el, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, had carried his oppo&s;ition into acts of vio|lence, more calculated to irritate the King than to &s;erve the nation. The part which he took in parliament was regular and manly. His warmth in the affair of the exclu&s;ion might be excu&s;ed by the utility of the mea|&s;ure. But when he appeared in the company of Otes, to pre&s;ent the Duke of York for recu&s;ancy, he &s;unk be|neath the dignity of his principles, and gave offence without &s;erving his own cau&s;e. No part of his public conduct &s;eemed to be either forgot or forgiven.

country, he had few equals. But his talents were li|mited; his temper &s;anguine; his patrioti&s;m frequently degenerated into pa&s;&s;ion. He was credulous, through vehemence; and, through his credulity, the dupe of de&s;igning men. His popularity, however, was neither acquired by art, nor retained by meanne&s;s. He was a &s;tranger to duplicity; and as he had few vices to hide, he concealed none of his virtues. Tho&s;e amiable quali|ties, which &s;eldom accompany an exten&s;ive capacity, rendered him regretted by all. Though he had no claim on the favour of Charles, his pardon would have been a popular act. His fate, however, has been more la|mented by late writers than by his own cotemporaries. Many could not &s;eparate the idea of rebellion from an in&s;urrection. Few could di&s;tingui&s;h a meditated ri&s;ing again&s;t the King's authority, from a de&s;ign again&s;t his life. The evils of a civil war were deemed, by the mo&s;t of mankind, more dangerous than the grievances which the popular party meant to prevent, by &s;uch vio|lent mea&s;ures. They could &s;carce reconcile to their minds, that the lo&s;s of a city election was a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for involving the nation in blood. Upon the whole, if the mea&s;ures of the crown ju&s;tified the de|&s;igns of Ru&s;&s;el, Charles was &s;carce to be blamed for abandoning that Lord to the animadver&s;ion of the law.</P>

This was Algernon Sidney, who had remained pri&s;oner in the tower ever &s;ince the beginning of July, when he was fir&s;t accu&s;ed by the Lord Howard of E&s;cric. An accidental change in the higher departments of the law &s;eemed to pave the way for the trial of Sidney. Sanders, lord-chief-ju&s;tice of the King's-Bench, a man of ob&s;cure birth and limited talents, had been found unfit for his place, from debilities which aro&s;e from an intemperate and vi|cious life. Upon his death, in the month of September, he was &s;ucceeded in his office by Sir George Jefferys<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">Kennet, vol. iii.</NOTE>, chief-ju&s;tice of Che&s;ter, a man of outrageous abilities and violent principles.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Algernon Sidney.</NOTE> Jefferys, from the fiercene&s;s of his character, was deemed the only fit match for the abilities and firmne&s;s of Sidney. On the 7th of November, the pri&s;oner was brought from the tower to the bar of the King's-Bench, where he was arraigned upon an indictment of high trea|&s;on, for con&s;piring the death of the King, and levying war again&s;t his Maje&s;ty. He de&s;ired a fortnight to prepare for his trial, which was granted; and he was brought again to the bar on the 21&s;t of November. The chief articles again&s;t him were his &s;ending a me&s;&s;enger into Scotland, to invite the malecontents of that king|dom to rebellion; and his writing a trea&s;onable libel, found in his clo&s;et, upon the original and forms of go|vernment.

But as one fact only, and that &s;worn by one witne&s;s, was not &s;uffi|cient to condemn the pri&s;oner, aid for that purpo&s;e was derived from the pretended libel found in his clo&s;et.

He argued again&s;t the credibility of the Lord Howard's evidence; and in that point only he &s;eems not to have been &s;incere. The profligacy of Howard, his ingrati|tude to Sidney him&s;elf, the point of view in which he &s;tood, as an evidence again&s;t his friends, were all favour|able to the pri&s;oner. But his adhering, without any ma|terial deviations, to the great line of facts already proved, left little room to doubt of the truth of his te&s;timony.

Though it was connected by the Attor|ney-general, and &s;u&s;tained by the judges, as a part of the late con&s;piracy, it appeared, by undoubted proofs, to have been written many years before.

The informality in the proceedings and the defects in the evidence were dangerous precedents, and generally con|demned. But the&s;e in&s;tances of inju&s;tice regard only the judges and the jury. Sidney a&s;ked a pardon in a manner calculated to have it refu&s;ed. Charles may be excu&s;ed for not granting it to one who was an avowed enemy to monarchy, and who was undoubtedly guilty of de&s;igns again&s;t his government, if not ultimately again&s;t his life. A fortnight after his receiving his &s;entence, Sidney was beheaded on Tower-hill; the King having remitted the ignominious part of his &s;entence, on ac|count of the high quality of his family. His behaviour at his execution, though firm and undaunted, was more enthu&s;ia&s;tic than dignified and &s;edate. In a &s;peech from the &s;caffold he repeated the &s;ub&s;tance of his defence at his trial in a manly, conci&s;e, but pa&s;&s;ionate manner; and when he was ready to lay his head on the block, he gloried to die for the good old cau&s;e in which he had been engaged from his youth<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">Kennet.

The bending of the laws to the purpo&s;es of vengeance was, in the pre&s;ent juncture, more dangerous as a precedent, than the puni&s;hments them&s;elves were unju&s;t. The crown, however, ought not to e&s;cape from cen&s;ure for the &s;everities of the courts of law.

In the motions of his per&s;on he was ea&s;y, graceful, and firm. His con&s;titution was &s;trong, and communicated an active vigour to all his limbs. Though a lover of ea&s;e of mind, he was fond of bodily exerci&s;e.

the &s;ixteenth of February, the white &s;taff from the hands of the King<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Kennet, vol. iii. James II. 1685.</NOTE>. The Marquis of Halifax, tho' known to have formerly been no friend to the King when Duke of York, was declared lord pre&s;ident, in the room of the Earl of Roche&s;ter. The impre&s;&s;ion which the able conduct of that nobleman, again&s;t the bill of exclu&s;ion, had made on the mind of James, was not obliterated by his oppo&s;ition in the cabinet again&s;t his views in the latter years of his brother's reign. When Halifax attempted to make an apology for his conduct, the King is reported to have &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"that he forgot all the pa&s;t, except his behaviour with regard to the bill of exclu&s;ion."</Q> This forgiving temper in James was, however, much circum&s;cribed. When the prin|cipal exclu&s;ioni&s;ts came to pay their re&s;pects, they are &s;aid to have been received with indifference, or treated with coldne&s;s. This might be &s;uitable to the &s;incerity which he affected to po&s;&s;e&s;s, but it &s;carce &s;eemed con|&s;i&s;tent with prudence.

The late King had formed a re&s;olution to &s;end the Earl of Clarendon, as lord-lieutenant, to Ireland, and to give the trea&s;urer's &s;taff to his brother, the Earl of Roche&s;|ter. Sunderland, having obtained &s;ecret intelligence that the pre&s;ent King was determined to pur&s;ue the &s;ame mea&s;ures, waited upon Roche&s;ter, who had been his po|litical enemy, and made the mo&s;t artful advances to gain his friend&s;hip. He told him, that though it had been his misfortune to differ with him formerly, it was the effect of the times, and not his inclination.

He endeavoured to expel vice from the court, and to re&s;tore decency and morality. He was him&s;elf at the head of all his affairs. He pre|&s;ided daily at the council, at the boards of admiralty and trea&s;ury. He even entered into the whole detail of the concerns of all the great departments of the &s;tate. But his bigotry for the Romi&s;h faith, &s;ullied all his good qualities, and rendered him feared for his violence where he was not de&s;pi&s;ed for his weakne&s;s.

Though he was from principle no friend to the aggrandizement of Lewis the Fourteenth, he was afraid to offend that mo|narch in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of his affairs. In the Prince of Orange he already dreaded a formidable rival. He was no &s;tranger to the views of his ambition. He was offended at the protection which he afforded to Mon|mouth. As the intere&s;t of the Prince and the Duke could never be the &s;ame, the former was &s;u&s;pected of encouraging troubles to his uncle, to derive advantage to him&s;elf from the confu&s;ion. But as it was dangerous to break with the Prince, for fear of giving a formidable head to the malecontents in England, James, notwith|&s;tanding his boa&s;ted &s;incerity, was forced to di&s;&s;emble his fears. He &s;poke publicly of his re&s;olution of living in confidence with his nephew, and to form a political connection with the States of Holland. He affected to treat the King of France with a punctilious &s;tateline&s;s. When he &s;ent Lord Churchill to announce his brother's death to Lewis, he commanded him to ob&s;erve with attention the ceremonies with which he was received.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dome&s;tic affairs.</NOTE> The oeconomy of James was certainly laudable; but it threw an appearance of meanne&s;s on &s;ome of his mea&s;ures. The late King, to who&s;e firmne&s;s he owed his throne, was buried with little pomp; and his own coronation, on the twenty-third of April, was a cere|mony neither expen&s;ive nor magnificent.

The inferior detail of the public bu&s;ine&s;s was thought too exten&s;ive to be minutely known by a Prince who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed talents to guide the great concerns of the kingdom. But had James <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> only his attention to the executive part of government,

his conduct, in&s;tead of meeting cen&s;ure, might have merited applau&s;e. But it was not to that department alone that the King is &s;aid to have confined him&s;elf. He is even &s;uppo&s;ed to have extended his influence to the admini&s;tration of public ju&s;tice. The &s;evere pro&s;ecu|tion of two noted criminals was at this time a&s;cribed, with &s;ome ju&s;tice, to his memory of former injuries. Otes, who had been virtually condemned to perpetual impri&s;onment in the preceding &s;ummer, by the enor|mous fine of one hundred thou&s;and pounds, was tried on two indictments for perjury on the eighth of May. Though few entertained any doubt of his guilt, his pu|ni&s;hment was deemed &s;evere. He was adjudged to &s;tand thrice in the pillory, to be twice whipped, to be impri|&s;oned for life, and to &s;tand five times in the pillory every year. Dangerfield, the author of the meal-tub-plot, received &s;entence to &s;tand twice in the pillory, to be whipped twice, and to pay a fine of five hundred pounds. The &s;entence of each was executed with the utmo&s;t &s;everity. But though nothing could be deemed too hard for &s;uch profligate men, the di&s;tance of the pu|ni&s;hment from the crime rendered them objects of pity in the eyes of the world<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">Publications of the times.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A parlia|ment.</NOTE> The nece&s;&s;ity of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a &s;tanding revenue had in|duced James to call a parliament &s;oon after his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne. The di&s;u&s;e of that a&s;&s;embly for more than four years rendered the mea&s;ure extremely agree|able to the nation. The &s;urrender of the charters of the boroughs threw a great weight with regard to elec|tions in the &s;cale of the crown. But though James and his &s;ervants may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have u&s;ed all the influence of government, the mo&s;t of tho&s;e members who had &s;ignalized them&s;elves in favour of the bill of exclu&s;ion were returned to the new parliament. No oppo&s;ition, however, was either expected by the enemies of the King, or feared by his friends. The &s;pirit of the op|po&s;ing party was &s;ubdued. The opinions of the people had de&s;erted them with their good fortune. Be&s;ides the character of the pre&s;ent King was extremely di&s;&s;i|milar to that of his brother. Charles was ever willing to purcha&s;e ca&s;e by conce&s;&s;ions. But the ob&s;tinate tem|per

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings of the com|mons.</NOTE> The parliament having met on the nineteenth of May at We&s;tmin&s;ter, the King made a &s;peech from the throne.

He reque&s;ted the commons to grant him for life the &s;ame revenue which his brother enjoyed.

Without one di&s;&s;enting voice, they re&s;olved that the revenue enjoyed by the late King &s;hould be &s;ettled for life on his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty. Their ready compliance, however, mu&s;t not be a&s;cribed altogether to timidity. Two rebellions threatened the kingdom; and the refu&s;al of a reque&s;t, deemed by the nation rea&s;onable, might in &s;ome mea&s;ure ju&s;tify the King for &s;eeking in the prerogative the relief which parliament &s;hould deny. But the complai&s;ance with which the &s;e&s;&s;ion began, continued to its end. The commons, upon receiving information of the de&s;cent of the Earl of Argyle in the we&s;t of Scotland, voted to &s;upport the King, again&s;t all rebels and traitors, with their lives and fortunes. This pliant di&s;po&s;ition &s;oothed the au&s;terity of James into mildne&s;s.

The committee were unanimous in their opinion, that an ad|dre&s;s &s;hould be pre&s;ented to the King, to put the laws in execution again&s;t di&s;&s;enters of all denominations.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Inva&s;ion.</NOTE> James, appri&s;ed of an intended inva&s;ion from Holland under Argyle, had given orders to the privy-council in Scotland to put the kingdom in a po&s;ture of defence. A proclamation was i&s;&s;ued, on the fir&s;t day of the meet|int of parliament, commanding all the militia of the ea&s;tern counties, and all able to bear arms in the north, to keep them&s;elves in readine&s;s to take the field. The Marquis of Athol was con&s;tituted lord-lieutenant of the county of Argyle; being deemed, from an hereditary feud, the mo&s;t proper per&s;on to oppo&s;e the Earl in the territories of his retainers and friends. Argyle, having &s;ailed from the Vly on the &s;econd of May, was &s;oon carried to the coa&s;t of Scotland by favourable winds. Having landed in the i&s;land of Mull with his friends, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed from thence to Kintyre and his other e&s;tates. Some of his former va&s;&s;als by inclination, and &s;everal, through terror, joined his &s;tandard; and he found him|&s;elf, in a few days, at the head of two thou&s;and men. He publi&s;hed two declarations; one in the name of his adherents, and another in his own. The grievances of the nation were enumerated in the fir&s;t with &s;ome ju&s;tice, though exaggerated. In the &s;econd, the Earl explained his own pre&s;ent views, and the inju&s;tice of his pa&s;t &s;uf|ferings. He declared again&s;t the right of the Duke of York to the throne, as being excluded from the &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion by the commons of England. He avowedly di&s;|claimed

all bonds of &s;ubjection to his authority. He de|clared ho&s;tilities again&s;t him and his adherents. He pro|mi&s;ed never to enter into any treaty or capitulation with the pre&s;ent government. He affirmed, that the unalter|able de&s;ign of him&s;elf and his party was to re&s;tore and &s;ettle the Prote&s;tant religion, to &s;uppre&s;s and perpetually exclude Popery, and its bitter root and &s;pring, prelacy; to indemnify all tho&s;e who had &s;uffered for their adherence to their liberties and religion<NOTE N="X" PLACE="foot">Journals of the commons.</NOTE>.</P>

He was fir&s;t carried to Gla&s;cow, then conveyed to Edinburgh, with every mark of ignominy and di&s;grace. His hands were bound behind; his head was bare. The executioner walked before him with an ax. Having been urged in vain to confe&s;s, he was beheaded, after a few days, upon his former &s;entence. He &s;uffered with that calmne&s;s and &s;erenity which attend men of courage in the la&s;t extreme.

The fir&s;t, after a &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance, was taken and hanged. The latter endeavoured to di&s;appoint his enemies, by &s;tabbing him&s;elf. He, how|ever, recovered of his wounds. He was carried to London, in hopes of making di&s;coveries; but being of a &s;ullen and ob&s;tinate temper, he treated ill the King him&s;elf, and &s;uf|fered with his friends. The in&s;urrection in Scotland was quelled with little blood&s;hed. Very few fell in the field. The mo&s;t of the followers of Argyle, by di&s;per&s;ing them|&s;elves, e&s;caped.

He refu&s;ed to the bi&s;hops who attended him at his death to own the legality of his marriage with the Duche&s;s; a&s;&s;erting, that Mrs. Wentworth was his only wife, in the &s;ight of God. When he came to the &s;caffold, he behaved with decency, and even with dignity. He &s;poke little. He made no confe&s;&s;ion. He accu&s;ed none of his friends. Circum|&s;tances are &s;aid to have attended his death that created a horror among the &s;pectators. The executioner, unmanned by terror, or touched with pity, mi&s;&s;ed his blow, and &s;truck him &s;lightly on the &s;houlder. Monmouth rai&s;ed his head from the block, and looked him full in the face, as if reproaching him for his mi&s;take. He &s;truck him twice again, but with feeble &s;trokes; and then threw the ax from his hands. The &s;heriff forced him to renew his attempt; and the head of the Duke, who &s;eemed already dead, was &s;evered at la&s;t from his body<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">Tenni&s;on in Kennet.</NOTE>.</P>

to a height too great for his limited capacity and under&s;tanding. His good-nature, the gentlene&s;s, and even the humanity of his di&s;po&s;ition, &s;eemed to render him worthy of a better fate. But the&s;e feeble virtues, which might have adorned a private life, were the &s;ource of all the misfortunes of Monmouth. The ea&s;ine&s;s which ren|dered him popular &s;ubjected him to the &s;chemes of de&s;ign|ing men, and at la&s;t involved him in difficulties, which con&s;ummate abilities could only &s;urmount. Though, among tho&s;e who knew him be&s;t, there remained little regret for his death, the affection of the vulgar followed him beyond the grave. They fondly believed, that their beloved Monmouth was &s;till to head them in the field; and that a per&s;on, warmed with the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion with them&s;elves, &s;ubmitted his neck to the ax in his &s;tead. Few of tho&s;e who accompanied him from Holland &s;uffered death with their unfortunate leader. The Lord Grey, by a full confe&s;&s;ion of the Rye-hou&s;e plot, obtained his par|don, as to life. Even the noted Fergu&s;on, though taken among the re&s;t, by an in&s;tance of clemency &s;trange for the times, was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed without puni&s;hment<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Publications of the times.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Severity of the Roy|ali&s;te,</NOTE> The royali&s;ts pur&s;ued their victory over the adherents of Monmouth with that violent &s;everity which too often attends &s;ucce&s;s in a civil war. When independent &s;tates contend with one another in arms, men only encounter enemies in the field; but when in&s;urgents fail in their attempts again&s;t a government, they are con&s;idered traitors, as well as foes. Ju&s;tice then becomes an engine of pa&s;|&s;ion. The laws are wre&s;ted for the purpo&s;e of revenge; and even the body of the people look upon cruelty and puni&s;hment with an indifference proportioned to their former fears.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">of Kirk</NOTE> The military executions of Kirk were attended with circum&s;tances of wanton cruelty and barbarity. The horror rai&s;ed by his conduct induced mankind to exagge|rate his &s;everities, and to apply to him &s;ome frightful ty|rannies related of former times. Though the barbarity of his own di&s;po&s;ition<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">James II. 1685.</NOTE>, and the &s;avage thir&s;t of blood which too frequently follows victory, ought, perhaps, to be only blamed on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, James certainly &s;hould have afterwards puni&s;hed a conduct of which he greatly di&s;approved<NOTE N="R" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. But the inhumanities of Kirk were &s;oon after eclip&s;ed by the rigour of Jefferys, who came to glean up with the law the wretched remains of the &s;word. A &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion of oyer and terminer was i&s;&s;ued to Jefferys, together with the lord chief baron of the exche|quer and three pui&s;ne judges, to try the rebels already con&s;ined in the we&s;t.

No proof was given that &s;he was privy to the circum&s;tance that either of the&s;e men had &s;erved the unfortunate Duke at Sedgemoor<NOTE N="U" PLACE="foot">James II. 1685.</NOTE>. Hicks &s;he received as a non-conformi&s;t mini&s;ter; and it did not appear that &s;hew knew either the name or crime of Nelthorp. Her &s;ex, her age, the ap|parent &s;incerity, and even the &s;implicity of her conduct and defence, wrought much on the jury in her favour.

The utmo&s;t that could be obtained from Jefferys, who was armed with all the powers of life and death, on this occa&s;ion, was the chang|ing of her &s;entence from hanging to beheading: A &s;trange favour from &s;uch a violent royali&s;t, as it, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, annexed the privilege of nobility to the lords created by Cromwell<NOTE N="Y" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. of the times</NOTE>.</P>

The terror of others for Jefferys's power prevented any impartial account to come to the ears of the King. In one in&s;tance, he added an in&s;ult to James him&s;elf to his own inju&s;tice. The King, &s;truck with the years, manner, and apparent hone&s;ty of a Major Holmes, who had been concerned in the Rye-hou&s;e plot, and privy to the late in&s;urrection, promi&s;ed him a free pardon.

He told the two hou&s;es, that the progre&s;s made by an incon&s;iderable number of men in the late rebellion, proved that the militia, in which the nation tru&s;ted, were not &s;ufficient for &s;uch occa&s;ions.

He repre&s;ented, as the con&s;equence of their unanimity at home, the great change wrought on the face of affairs abroad, &s;o much to the honour of the kingdom, and the figure it ought to make in the world. He apprehended not, he &s;aid, for his own part, &s;uch a misfortune as a divi&s;ion, or even a coldne&s;s, be|tween him and his parliament.

The danger of di&s;pen&s;ing with the te&s;t was painted in lively colours. The hou&s;e was impre&s;|&s;ed with terrors of Popery; and more were willing to e&s;tabli&s;h new defences again&s;t that religion, than to per|mit any encroachments upon the old. Halifax, lately di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the councils of James, oppo&s;ed with abi|lity the mea&s;ures of the court. Jefferys endeavoured to &s;upport them in vain. His &s;peech was received with contempt where it was not heard with indignation.&mdash;The motion for con&s;idering the &s;peech was carried; and the twenty-third of November was appointed for that purpo&s;e. This point was more important than it &s;eemed at the fir&s;t view. Had the lords remained as pa&s;&s;ive as the commons, a &s;tanding army would have been virtually e&s;tabli&s;hed by the authority of the legi&s;|lature; and the di&s;pen&s;ing power would have remained in fact with the crown, by the connivance of the two hou&s;es. James being determined to yield in nothing, was re&s;olved to avoid the mortification of hearing more cen&s;ures upon his conduct. He &s;acrificed the &s;upply in a manner to his pride; and, on the twentieth of No|vember, &s;uddenly prorogued the parliament.</P>

They petitioned the peers, when the parliament met, to be relea&s;ed from their confinement.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">King's kind|ne&s;s to re|fugees.</NOTE> The lenity of James to tho&s;e criminals of di&s;tinction was accompanied with another act of &s;ignal humanity. The enthu&s;ia&s;m of Lewis the Fourteenth had induced him to revoke the edict of Nantz, which had &s;ecured, ever &s;ince the time of Henry the Fourth the Prote&s;tants of France in the exerci&s;e of their religion. The mea|&s;ure was at once very arbitrary and extremely impoli|tic.

Five hundred thou&s;and &s;ouls preferred their liberty of con&s;cience to their country. They quitted France with a great part of its wealth; and carried the arts and manufactures, which had enriched that kingdom, to all the corners of Europe. More than fifty thou&s;and of the fugitives came to England. James openly blamed Lewis. He aided with money the refugees.

His plan for executing this purpo&s;e was the more dangerous, as it was to be carried forward through the line of a general toleration, which, one would think, the common &s;en&s;e of mankind ought to have e&s;tabli&s;hed in every country. But a Prince of his bigotry neither received

nor de&s;erved credit for an affected moderation in &s;piri|tual affairs. By precipitating his de&s;igns, they became too &s;oon obvious to the world; and they were dreaded, oppo&s;ed, and defeated. Though he profe&s;&s;ed that he only carried his views to a freedom of con&s;cience to all his &s;ubjects, it was manife&s;t, that by virtually di&s;pen&s;ing with the te&s;t, he meant to fill gradually every department with per&s;ons of his own favourite &s;y&s;tem of faith.&mdash;The propen&s;ity of mankind to intere&s;t, he knew, would gain pro&s;elytes, a race of men of whom this deluded prince was extremely fond; and thus, he deemed, that without any violence, the Romi&s;h faith would, by degrees, become fir&s;t the religion of the court, and then &s;pread it&s;elf to the nation.</P>

He was le&s;s re&s;erved in Ireland, where the majority of the people were already attached to the Romi&s;h faith. In the autumn of 1684, the late King, either &s;wayed by the coun&s;els of the Duke of York, or having adopted of him&s;elf &s;ome new &s;y&s;tem of policy, not perfectly known, had re&s;olved to remove the Duke of Ormonde, and to place the government of Ire|land in other hands. In the month of December, the Earl of Roche&s;ter was nominated to that high office; but, before he made any preparations for his journey, the death of the King altered his views. James, upon his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, adopted his brother's &s;cheme for the removal of Ormonde; and that Duke, having re|&s;igned the &s;word of &s;tate to the Archbi&s;hop of Armagh and the Earl of Granard, as lords-ju&s;tices, arrived in London on the thirty-fir&s;t of March. The tranquillity of Ireland continued when a double rebellion di&s;turbed the repo&s;e of the two Briti&s;h kingdoms. Though the acce&s;&s;ion of a popi&s;h King had rai&s;ed the hopes of the catholics, and excited the fears of the prote&s;tants, their animo&s;ities extended no further than futile informations again&s;t the loyalty of each other; complaints, which the lords-ju&s;tices had the prudence to di&s;regard<NOTE N="U" PLACE="foot">Carte's Ormonde, Leland, Memoirs of Ireland.</NOTE>.</P>

to recal the arms of the militia, and to depo&s;it them in different &s;tores.

A general ferment prevailed. But it aro&s;e more from the fluctuating pa&s;&s;ions of the two &s;ects than from any actual di&s;turbance. In this &s;ituation of affairs, a new lord-lieutenant, the Earl of Clarendon, arrived in Ireland.

illegal, as the con&s;titution was then defined. The di&s;|pen&s;ing power, though under&s;tood as confined in its ope|rations, had been of great antiquity in the Engli&s;h go|vernment. Penal &s;tatutes, e&s;pecially as they were gene|rally intended to arm the King with authority, were deemed, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to be the property of his pre|rogative, and &s;ubject to his controul. The parliament it&s;elf had often recognized this power in the crown. The commons, who had forced from Charles the Fir&s;t the petition of right, owned the di&s;pen&s;ing power in all its plenitude. Coke him&s;elf, who&s;e authority is &s;o high, believed the power of &s;u&s;pending laws &s;o much inherent in the crown, that it even cannot be aboli&s;hed by an act of parliament. Neither was the practice of taking the judgment of the courts of law upon the di&s;pen&s;ing power any novelty in the con&s;titution of England. The judges declared, in the reign of Henry the Seventh, that the King could di&s;pen&s;e with a &s;tatute containing a clau&s;e expre&s;sly precluding him from that prerogative. In the reign of James the Fir&s;t, the judges confirmed the &s;ame doctrine; and the opinion had been, ever &s;ince that period, received as undoubted law<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Herbert's Vindication.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">recognized by the judges.</NOTE> But neither the&s;e high authorities nor the precedents of ages were &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify a practice &s;ubver&s;ive of that confidence in their permanency which &s;eems nece&s;|&s;ary to the very being of laws. Men could &s;carce di&s;tin|gui&s;h the di&s;pen&s;ing prerogative from a repealing power in the crown. They ju&s;tly deemed it unrea&s;onable that a le&s;s authority &s;hould de&s;troy than that which was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to make laws. Be&s;ides, though the power of di&s;pen&s;ing with the penal &s;tatutes might have been, for prudent ends, lodged in the crown, it was at fir&s;t under|&s;tood to be limited to ca&s;es where the King alone was concerned.

In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the matter was extremely different.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Encamp|ment at Houn&s;low.</NOTE> The&s;e attempts to intimidate the church produced the u&s;ual effect of religious per&s;ecution.

The clergy continued their polemical di&s;cour&s;es again&s;t Popery; and James, though perhaps offended, had for &s;ome time the prudence to ab&s;tain from further animadver&s;ions on their conduct. The pu|ni&s;hment of one John&s;on, a clergyman, for writing a libel, was productive of &s;ome noi&s;e, in the pre&s;ent jea|lou&s;y which prevailed in the kingdom. The King, having determined to &s;upport his authority, formed, during the &s;ummer, a camp on Houn&s;low-heath, con|&s;i&s;ting of fifteen thou&s;and men. He &s;pent a great part of his time in training and di&s;ciplining the&s;e troops; and this force was deemed by the people, and, perhaps, in|tended by James, as an o&s;tentation of his own ability to overcome all oppo&s;ition to his authority. Though the whole army con&s;i&s;ted almo&s;t entirely of Prote&s;tants, the nation, new to a &s;tanding force, &s;eemed to dread, that, through the unlimited obedience of military di&s;cipline, they might be induced to &s;upport mea&s;ures contrary to their own religious principles. Under this impre&s;&s;ion, John&s;on, who had formerly been chaplain to the Lord Ru&s;&s;el, wrote an addre&s;s to the army. The paper was manife&s;tly &s;editious.

But the pro&s;pect of obtaining, through the folly of James, the Engli&s;h throne, was not the &s;ole de&s;ign which employed the thoughts of the Prince of Orange. The jealou&s;y which he had ever entertained of the too great power of France, had been lately inflamed by per&s;onal injuries, on the part of Lewis the Fourteenth. The territory from which his family derived their title had been &s;eized by that monarch unju&s;tly; and it was &s;till retained by force. He was re&s;olved to be revenged, if he could not obtain ju&s;tice. The famous league of Aug&s;bourg, which took place in the year 1687, was projected by his abilities, and carried to a conclu&s;ion by his influence. This alliance united again&s;t France all her enemies in the preceding war. But &s;till the league was deemed imperfect, as long as England ob&s;erved a neutrality; and though James was not in&s;en&s;ible of the honour of his kingdom, it could &s;carce be expected that he would offend France, by abetting the views of the known rival of his power. Nor was the backwardne&s;s of his uncle the only ob&s;tacle which the Prince had to &s;urmount. Some members of the States of Holland, gained by France, or offended at his own arbitrary pro|ceedings<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">D'Avaux, vol. iv.</NOTE> as Stadtholder, ob&s;tructed his preparations for war. He was even &s;o &s;en&s;ible of their jealou&s;y, that he endeavoured to remove it by an ingenious artifice.

This &s;erved the double purpo&s;e of his ambition.

His piety was prai&s;|ed, his moderation exalted, his magnanimity rai&s;ed to the &s;kies. The adulation of civil &s;ocieties yielded not to the vehement profe&s;&s;ions of religious &s;ects.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Intrigues of the Prince of Orange</NOTE> While James amu&s;ed him&s;elf with the unmeaning ad|dre&s;&s;es of an incon&s;iderable part of the nation, the body of the people, though &s;ilent, were offended. The Prince of Orange, who had long fixed his eye on the Engli&s;h throne, watched his motions, and made every advantage of his errors. When the Earl of Roche&s;ter was re|moved, and Tyrconnel &s;ent to Ireland, he re&s;olved to di&s;patch a tru&s;ty per&s;on to England, to foment the jea|lou&s;y of the Prote&s;tants<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">D'Avaux, vol. iv.</NOTE>. Dykvelt, a man of intrigue, and well known to the leaders of the party, was ap|pointed for that delicate &s;ervice. The Prince formed, by an artifice, a &s;pecious pretence for Dykvelt's em|ba&s;&s;y. The encroachments of the Dutch on the Eng|li&s;h Ea&s;t-India company, with regard to their commerce in A&s;ia, were reported to have rai&s;ed the re&s;entment of James to a pitch that threatened the States with a war. Some naval preparations in England gave an appearance of ju&s;tice to this tale; and the Province of Holland, by the recommendation of Pen&s;ionary Fagel, employed Dyk|velt as their mini&s;ter extraordinary, to &s;ooth the King of England. Dykvelt, under a public character, re&s;ided in England from February to the end of May. He held during that time a clo&s;e corre&s;pondence with the Prote&s;tant leaders, and formed the outlines of that ge|neral revolt, which &s;oon after precipitated the unfortu|nate James from his throne<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">in England. May.</NOTE> James was no &s;tranger to the intrigues of Dykvelt.

His chief object was to obtain for his favoured &s;ect a total abolition of the te&s;t and penal laws. He had u&s;ed in vain all his influence with the leading members of the two hou&s;es of parliament for this purpo&s;e; and he found, that tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed him the mo&s;t, were the greate&s;t friends of the Prince of Orange. The King therefore re&s;olved to apply to the Prince for his con&s;ent.

<P><MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Unpopula|rity of the King.</NOTE> THE conte&s;t with the bi&s;hops completed the unpo|pularity of the King. But he derived the &s;udden|ne&s;s of his ruin from the birth of a Prince of Wales. That circum&s;tance increa&s;ed the fears of his &s;ubjects, in proportion as it rai&s;ed his &s;ecurity and hopes. In the reign of a Prince to be educated under the prejudices of &s;uch a father, nothing but a continuance of the &s;ame uncon&s;titutional mea&s;ures could be expected. James, convinced in his mind of the indefea&s;ible right of Kings,
<PB N="456" REF="480">
transferred his own weakne&s;s to his people; and vainly hoped to retain them by their principles of loyalty, after he had, through repeated injuries, lo&s;t their confidence and love. Guided in all his actions by a &s;peculative &s;y&s;tem of policy, he &s;eemed to &s;uppo&s;e that monarchy mu&s;t end where the fir&s;t breach upon the hereditary &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion began. Neither mortification nor misfortune it&s;elf could convince this infatuated Prince of his error. While he dreamed of &s;ecurity from the birth of a &s;on, he might perceive that his own fall was near. So low was his credit &s;unk among his people, &s;uch pre&s;cience they all had of his fate, that the child had like to have died before a wet-nur&s;e to &s;uckle him could be pro|cured^R.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His political views.</NOTE> In this &s;tate of public indifference, James might have langui&s;hed through an unimportant reign, were there any pro&s;pect that his &s;y&s;tem of unpopular policy would have terminated with his own life. But the nation dreaded from the &s;on tho&s;e grievances which they had experienced from the father. Though the deci&s;ion of a court of law, though the concurring opinions of al|mo&s;t the whole nation had exploded the di&s;pen&s;ing power, there &s;carce could remain a doubt, that James would embrace every favourable opportunity to exert it with zeal. He derived his attachment to this high pre|rogative from principle as well as enthu&s;ia&s;m. He be|lieved that &s;upremacy in matters of religion was an in|herent right in the crown, which no regulation could alter, no act of the legi&s;lature extingui&s;h. He con&s;i|dered the laws again&s;t toleration as obtained through faction, and carried into execution through envy. Be|&s;ides, he weakly deemed that the right of the crown to the &s;ervice of every &s;ubject ought to &s;uper&s;ede all re|&s;trictions to the contrary; and that the King, as guar|dian of the peace of his people, might at plea&s;ure remi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> or execute laws calculated only for the &s;afety of his ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> government.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Intrigues</NOTE> While James was bu&s;y in lo&s;ing the affections of his people, the Prince of Orange continued his &s;chemes for mounting the throne. The church of England, by re|cent injuries, were thrown into his &s;cale; and he him|&s;elf, by declaring his wi&s;hes for a general toleration of wor&s;hip, had gained the Di&s;&s;enters. Some men of high rank, who loved their country, afraid of the arbitrary &s;chemes of James, favoured the Prince's ambition from patriot motives. Many through the love of novelty, &s;everal from di&s;appointment, &s;ome from hopes of rai&s;ing them&s;elves, entered with eagerne&s;s into his de&s;igns. He, in the mean time, was employed with &s;ucce&s;s in putting him&s;elf in a condition to accompli&s;h his own views, as well as tho&s;e of his friends. He retained the fleet, which the States had placed in his hands in the preceding year. He provided him&s;elf with trea&s;ure, by laying an embargo on the money produced by the levy on the two hundredth penny impo&s;ed by the States. He received the &s;um of four millions of florins, by way of advance upon that tax, from the French refugees. Having the principal &s;ervants of James in his pay, he was minutely informed of the mo&s;t &s;ecret tran&s;actions and even de&s;igns of that Prince. His intelligence came, through Sidney, from Sunderland, who betrayed the very mea&s;ures which he him&s;elf had advi&s;ed<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">D'Avaux, vol. iv.</NOTE>.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and prepa|rations</NOTE> The news of the birth of a &s;on to James, coming to the Hague on the fourteenth of June, the Prince was &s;uddenly di&s;concerted in all his mea&s;ures. Deceived by his informations from London, he deemed that the Queen could not be brought to bed till the middle of the &s;ucceeding month. In the fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e of the news, he di&s;patched Zuyli&s;tein to congratulate James on the birth of an heir to the throne; and, by that means, gave publicly his countenance to a fact which he found &s;oon after convenient to deny. Upon the arrival of Admiral Herbert, who had quitted the &s;ervice of James, the Prince of Orange repented of his complai&s;ance in felicitating his father-in-law. He took the &s;udden re&s;o|lution to deny the birth of the Prince, and even to con|vince

The envoys of the allies denied their pre&s;ence. Not one invited to the fea&s;t &s;ent even an excu&s;e for ab&s;ence. Advices from England induced the Prince to take this deci&s;ive part.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">of the Prince</NOTE> But though the Prince was no &s;tranger to the &s;trength of his party in England, he had hitherto received no formal invitation to pa&s;s into that kingdom, to &s;ettle its affairs.

Many, who expected with impatience his pre&s;ence, were unwilling to commit them&s;elves to writing on a matter &s;o full of danger. The Earls of Shrew&s;bury, Devon&s;hire, and Danby, the Lord Lumley, the Bi&s;hop of London, and Ru&s;&s;el and Sidney, &s;igned at length an invitation, on the thirtieth of June<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">Dalrymple's App.</NOTE>. The in&s;trument was rather a matter of form than an object of encouragement.

He repre&s;ented to them the danger which threatened the Prote&s;tant reli|gion &s;hould the impo&s;ture of a Prince of Wales be lon|ger tolerated. The deputies giving no credit to this tale, Van Citters was brought to convince them from England. The Prince him&s;elf ordered a book to be written to prove the &s;puriou&s;ne&s;s of the birth. He re|&s;olved to enter his own prote&s;t. He promi&s;ed protection to all tho&s;e who &s;hould declare again&s;t the impo&s;ture. To carry forward the political farce with &s;ome &s;olem|nity, he ordered into his pre&s;ence the preaching mini|&s;ters at the Hague. They recommended to his care the perilous &s;tate of the Prote&s;tant faith. He an&s;wered them with a grave formality. He reque&s;ted them to re|double their prayers to Heaven, for that religion was never in &s;uch danger before. But, if the mini&s;ters ad|dre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to God, they al&s;o u&s;ed their influence with men. They inflamed the vulgar to a degree of madne&s;s by their di&s;cour&s;es; and the deputies of Am|&s;terdam, who, from patriot views, had long oppo&s;ed them&s;elves to the aggrandizement of the Prince of Orange, dur&s;t not ob&s;truct his pre&s;ent de&s;igns, for fear of being torn to pieces by the rabble<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">D'Avaux, vol. iv. pa&s;&s;im.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">for invading</NOTE> A coincidence of fortunate events favoured, at the &s;ame time, the de&s;igns of the Prince of Orange. The death of the Elector of Cologn, by intere&s;ting France and the allies in a new election, gave a colour to in|trigues and preparations. Lewis the Fourteenth &s;up|ported the preten&s;ions of the Cardinal de Fur&s;temberg. Prince Clement of Bavaria was abetted by the Emperor, the Dutch, and the court of Rome. The latter at length prevailed, through the partiality of the Pope<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;toire d'Allemagne, tom. iii.</NOTE>; and France threatened to recover by force what &s;he had lo&s;t by intrigue. Under the pretence of danger from that &s;ide, the Prince of Orange formed a camp of twenty thou&s;and men, between Grave and Nimeguen, in the month of Augu&s;t. To make up this body of troops, he &s;tript Dutch Flanders of all her garri&s;ons. He left Bergen-op-zoom it&s;elf expo&s;ed. He continued, in the mean time, his preparations by &s;ea. He equip|ped

Yet, amid all the&s;e extraordinary preparations, five only of the States were privy to his real de&s;igns. He had the addre&s;s to lull James into &s;e|curity; and though Lewis the Fourteenth long &s;u&s;pect|ed, and even was at length a&s;&s;ured of the intended inva|&s;ion, he adopted no effectual means to ob&s;truct mea&s;ures which, in the i&s;&s;ue, proved highly detrimental to his own power<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">D'Avaux, vol. iv</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">England.</NOTE> But though the States were not formally admitted into the &s;ecret de&s;igns of the Prince of Orange, they could not have been &s;trangers to his real views. The body of the people, being highly inflamed again&s;t France upon various grounds, exhibited an irre&s;i&s;tible eagerne&s;s for every preparation for war. Their com|merce had been dimini&s;hed one fourth<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>, by re&s;trictions on their u&s;ual trade with France. Their religious zeal was kindled by the hard&s;hips impo&s;ed by Lewis on the Prote&s;tants, by the impolitic revocation of the edict of Nantz. The terrors rai&s;ed by the conduct of James in England had &s;pread to Holland. His zeal for the Roman Catholic faith was exaggerated into the certain ruin of Prote&s;tanti&s;m. They &s;aw them&s;elves &s;urrounded with perils on every &s;ide; and they lo&s;t the animo&s;ities rai&s;ed by the jealou&s;y of commerce again&s;t the Engli&s;h, in their pity for a people expo&s;ed to the inroads of Popery and arbitrary power. One half of Europe had even entered into a con&s;piracy again&s;t James, through the ad|dre&s;s of his &s;on-in-law. The power, and, above all, the in&s;olence of Lewis, had con&s;pired with the memory of former injuries to inflame the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria again&s;t France. The princes of Germany were united again&s;t her by their fears; and nothing but the gaining the aid of England, by the removal of James, &s;eemed wanting to complete their revenge<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Security</NOTE> While the half of Europe combined again&s;t the King of England, while many of his &s;ubjects were bent to oppo&s;e, and &s;ome to dive&s;t him of his power, he repo&s;ed him&s;elf in an unaccountable &s;ecurity. Lewis the Four|teenth,

who had long received the mo&s;t certain intelli|gence of the de&s;igns of the Prince of Orange, rou&s;ed James in vain to attention, and offered to no purpo&s;e his aid. Having refu&s;ed to accede to the league of Aug&s;bourg, the King was publickly accu&s;ed by his &s;on-in-law with a private treaty with France. To convince his &s;ubjects of the fal&s;ehood of this charge, he declined to accept the offer of a French &s;quadron to join his fleet. This offer, which was made in June, e&s;caped not the vigilance of Van Citters. He complained to the King, who an&s;wered, that he would make no u&s;e of a foreign force, unle&s;s obliged by his ma&s;ters<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">James II. 1688.</NOTE>. Deceived by his &s;ervants, and betrayed throughout by the Earl of Sunderland, he had the weakne&s;s to believe that the re|ports of an inva&s;ion were rai&s;ed to frighten him into a &s;trict connection with France. Be&s;ides, he gave credit to the repeated a&s;&s;urances of the States, that the arma|ment prepared in their ports was not de&s;igned again&s;t England.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His decla|ration.</NOTE> Six days before the Prince took this formal leave of the States, he publi&s;hed a declaration, penned by Fagel, to be di&s;per&s;ed upon his landing in England. This ela|borate, but heavy performance, enumerated, in fifteen articles, the more notorious attacks made by James on the religion and laws of the Briti&s;h kingdoms. He con|cluded his charge again&s;t the Engli&s;h government, for he laid no blame on the King, with expre&s;&s;ing the great and violent pre&s;umptions, that the Prince of Wales was

not born of the Queen. He a&s;&s;ured the world, that his expedition was intended for no other de&s;ign but to procure a free parliament, to heal the breaches between the King and his &s;ubjects. This declaration was tran&s;|lated by Burnet from the French of Fagel; and even printed, when intelligence arrived from England that the King had retracted almo&s;t all the mea&s;ures of which the Prince complained. A &s;upplement was immediatly added. The change in the coun&s;els of James was perhaps ju&s;tly a&s;cribed to fear. The Prince expre&s;&s;ed his re&s;olution to procure a confirmation of the conce&s;&s;ions already made, in a free parliament, which &s;hould a&s;&s;emble under the &s;helter of his arms. This &s;elf-denial of the Prince was too common to be deemed &s;incere.

The city of York was &s;eized by the Earl of Danby. In Derby, the Earl of Devon&s;hire declared for the Prince of Orange. The Bi&s;hop of London, under pretence of a guard, formed a kind of an army round the Prince&s;s Anne, in Northamp|ton. The Earl of Bath, the governor of Plymouth, held that place for the Prince.

He ju&s;tly judged, when once a breach was made on the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, that it mattered little how far the &s;ettlement of the crown &s;hould deviate from the genuine line. The Prince&s;s of Orange had no better title than her hu&s;band to the throne, while her father and brother were alive. Be&s;ides, he perceived that he could add to the number of his own party, with the &s;ame mea&s;ure which &s;hould gratify the Prince. Men of republican principles highly favoured an alteration in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as the means of weakening or perhaps aboli&s;hing monarchy. They were the chief in&s;truments in guiding, and even terrify|ing the people to the mode of &s;ettlement promoted by Halifax, who &s;eemed him&s;elf to act only under the di|rection of the Prince's Dutch &s;ervants and friends. Their eagerne&s;s upon this head had led them into an error de&s;tructive of their romantic views. They had even inve&s;ted already the Prince with the fir&s;t preroga|tive of the crown, the privilege of calling a parliament. In&s;tead of i&s;&s;uing directions, when they met in conven|tion, for the choice of a free parliament, they, with pe|culiar ab&s;urdity, employed the Prince of Orange in ac|compli&s;hing that work; as if they could transfer to a foreigner, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no office that the con&s;titution recogni&s;ed, a right, which they were afraid to exert them&s;elves.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Danby fa|vours the Prince&s;s.</NOTE> The Earl of Danby, though &s;eemingly more mode|rate, was more ab&s;urd than Halifax. He wi&s;hed to pre&s;erve inviolable the claims of monarchy, yet re&s;olved to break the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. He endeavoured to gain the Prince, by transferring the crown to his wife, as the next heir. The folly which induced him to believe be|fore, that the Prince of Orange invaded England for a le&s;s prize than the throne, gave him hopes that he would now re&s;t &s;atisfied with the honour of having a queen for his con&s;ort. Danby was not, however, de|&s;titute of &s;upport in his opinion. The warm abettors of monarchy were half reconciled to an expedient, which overturned not quite their principles.

prove, that the King's de&s;erting the kingdom, without appointing any per&s;on to admini&s;ter the government during his ab&s;ence, amounted, in rea&s;on as well as in law, to a demi&s;e. There was no novelty in this argument. It had been frequently urged without doors, ever &s;ince it was fir&s;t mentioned in the a&s;&s;embly of the peers in December. Men more violent than Dolben objected to his motion of a demi&s;e, as too narrow a foundation for a firm and permanent &s;ettlement. They affirmed, that this political demi&s;e inferred, that the crown ought im|mediately to fall on the next heir. But as this would be attended with the &s;ame inconvenience which they wi&s;hed to remove, they in&s;i&s;ted, that there could be no de&s;cent in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e; and that the throne being vacated by the de&s;ertion of the Prince, the royal autho|rity had fallen to the di&s;po&s;al of the people, from whom it originally aro&s;e.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates in the</NOTE> The lords who oppo&s;ed the motion urged arguments &s;till more &s;pecious. They affirmed, that a regency ap|pointed without the con&s;ent of the King, was a greater breach upon monarchy than the filling of the throne by election. They could find no difference, they &s;aid, between dethroning the King and depriving him of all authority. They urged the manife&s;t ab&s;urdity of having two kings at the &s;ame time; the one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the power, and the other of the title; e&s;pecially when, in the very nature of the thing, they mu&s;t be in perpetual oppo&s;ition. A regency in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, they &s;aid, would be more illegal, as well as more un&s;afe, than a King with even a di&s;putable title. The law of England, they continued, had provided for the &s;ecurity of the &s;ubject, in &s;ubmitting to the King in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but no &s;tatute had made any provi&s;ion for the &s;afety of tho&s;e who &s;hould adhere to a regent again&s;t the lawful Prince. Should the government, they &s;aid, be carried on in the name of James, the nation would con&s;ider him &s;till as their real King; and &s;hould any per&s;on endeavour, either by plot or in&s;urrection, to re&s;tore him to his au|thority, &s;uch per&s;on could not be pro&s;ecuted, as for high|trea&s;on, for an act which the laws con&s;trued into a duty. In the weakne&s;s or infancy of a Prince, for in&s;tance, they &s;aid the ca&s;e was extremely different. The will of the regent was then con&s;idered as the will of the King. But, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, a perpetual conte&s;t mu&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;t between them; the one endeavouring to recover his power, the other to pre&s;erve his authority.</P>

A que&s;tion more &s;peculative and le&s;s important could &s;carce engage the attention of a deliberative a&s;&s;embly. When men are forced to return to fir&s;t principles, there is a kind of ridicule in &s;earching for precedents. Argu|ments from rea&s;on might be produced, that a kind of compact was under&s;tood to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the &s;ubject and the &s;overeign. But the actual exi&s;tence of &s;uch a compact was as unnece&s;&s;ary as the fact it&s;elf was untrue.

But when the chain was once broken, the monarch could po&s;&s;e&s;s no more power than what the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws be&s;towed. The crown was re&s;pected more than the Prince. It was no longer con&s;idered as private property, &s;ince the hands which gave might re&s;ume it again.

His ungracious addre&s;s, his for|bidding manner, the phlegm of his di&s;po&s;ition, and even the ungracefulne&s;s of a &s;ickly and emaciated form, were by no means qualities either to gain or retain the affec|tions of the vulgar. He however derived &s;ecurity from the &s;tate of the times, as well as from his own parts. Men could le&s;s forgive James for the injuries they had done to that deluded Prince, than for tho&s;e which he him&s;elf was &s;uppo&s;ed to have done to the laws.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections</NOTE> Such was the end of the reign of James the Second, a Prince, who&s;e impolitic conduct deprived, in a great mea&s;ure, his very misfortunes of regret. He met with the common fate of the unfortunate: he was more blamed than he de&s;erved. His enthu&s;ia&s;m in favour of a religion which his &s;ubjects abhorred, was a &s;pecies of madne&s;s rather than a crime. There is, however, &s;carce any rea|&s;on to believe that he him&s;elf, with all his bigotry, ever entertained hopes of e&s;tabli&s;hing the Romi&s;h faith in England<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">James II.</NOTE>. He was evidently hurried into &s;ome of his wor&s;t mea&s;ures by &s;ervants, who were bribed by his ene|mies to betray him to his ruin. The Popi&s;h cabinet, who fir&s;t advi&s;ed the di&s;pen&s;ing power<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>, was formed by Sunderland, then in the pay, as well as privy to the views, of the Prince of Orange; and the violence of Jefferys kindled a difference with the bi&s;hops, which ha&s;tened his ma&s;ter's ruin<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. His attack upon Magdalene-college,
<PB N="513" REF="541">
in Oxford, though &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ive of his dangerous principles, was carried to extremity more through the arts of Sunderland, than by his own violence. Though he avowedly de&s;igned that college as a &s;eminary for his favou|rite &s;ect<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">James II.</NOTE>, there is &s;carce any rea&s;on to doubt, had he heard of the fir&s;t petition of the fellows, but he would have dropt his per&s;ecution of Oxford, as he had relinqui&s;hed his attempt on Cambridge.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">on the reign,</NOTE> He is, however, by no means to be excu&s;ed in many other parts of his conduct. His haughtine&s;s to his par|liament when they &s;at, his tampering with them after|wards, to favour his views, his keeping on foot a great army, without the excu&s;e of dome&s;tic di&s;turbances or fo|reign war, were irrefragable proofs of his arbitrary prin|ciples, and ultimately of his de&s;igns. His interference with the common cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, by di&s;placing judges who interpreted not the laws according to his inclination, was a dangerous grievance, and rai&s;ed, with ju&s;tice, the jealou&s;y, and even the indignation of his people. His partiality to Papi&s;ts, to the exclu&s;ion of his other &s;ubjects, was full of inju&s;tice and weakne&s;s. His own open pro|fe&s;&s;ion of the Romi&s;h faith, his encouraging the prie&s;ts of that religion to appear at his court in the habits of their re&s;pective orders, his licen&s;ing places of wor&s;hip for his favourite &s;ect, his erecting popi&s;h &s;chools, to &s;educe the children of his &s;ubjects from Prote&s;tani&s;m, were in&s;tances of in&s;ult to his people, as well as of folly in him&s;elf. His whole reign, in &s;hort, was full of imprudencies in his own conduct, and with attacks on the favourite prin|ciples of his people.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and cha|racter,</NOTE> In many re&s;pects, it mu&s;t be owned that he was a vir|tuous man, as well as a good monarch. He was frugal of the public money. He encouraged commerce with great attention. He applied him&s;elf to naval affairs with &s;ucce&s;s. He &s;upported the fleet, as the glory and protec|tion of England<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">Ibid. pa&s;&s;im.</NOTE>. He was al&s;o zealous for the honour of his country. He was capable of &s;upporting its intere&s;ts with a degree of dignity in the &s;cale of Europe. In his private life he was almo&s;t irreproachable. He was an in|dulgent parent, a tender hu&s;band, a generous and &s;teady friend. In his deportment he was affable, though &s;lately. He be&s;towed favours with peculiar grace. He prevented
<PB N="514" REF="542">
&s;olicitation by the &s;uddenne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;al of places. Though &s;carce any prince was ever &s;o generally de&s;erted, few ever had &s;o many private friends. Tho&s;e who injured him the mo&s;t were the fir&s;t to implore his forgivene&s;s; and even after they had rai&s;ed another Prince to his throne, they re&s;pected his per&s;on, and were anxious for his &s;afety. To the&s;e virtues he added a &s;teadine&s;s of coun&s;els, a per|&s;everance in his plans, and courage in his enterpri&s;es. He was honourable and fair in all his dealings. He was unju&s;t to men in their principles, but never with regard to their property. Though few monarchs ever offended a people more, he yielded to none in his love of his &s;ub|jects. He even affirmed, that he quitted England to pre|vent the horrors of a civil war, as much as from fear of a re&s;traint upon his per&s;on from the Prince of Orange. His great virtue was a &s;trict adherence to facts and truth in all he wrote and &s;aid, though &s;ome parts of his conduct had rendered his &s;incerity in his political profe&s;&s;ions &s;u&s;|pected by his enemies.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">views,</NOTE> There is, however, nothing more certain than that the people found them&s;elves aggrieved; and that, con&s;equently they had a right to do ju&s;tice to them&s;elves. Though, in England, apprehen&s;ions for the future were much greater than pre&s;ent grievances, yet that conduct in the Prince, which rai&s;ed tho&s;e apprehen&s;ions, ought to be oppo&s;ed. There is rea&s;on to believe, that the preference given to a &s;ect, whom the people in general abhorred, rai&s;ed more indignation than actual fears of the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Popi&s;h religion. The thing it&s;elf was, even at the time, deemed, by men of &s;en&s;e, impo&s;&s;ible<NOTE N="R" PLACE="foot">Marquis of Hali&s;ax to the Prince of Orange.</NOTE>. The Papi&s;ts &s;carce bore the proportion of one to two hundred Pro|te&s;tants in the nation. Scarce one in fifty of the army, which created &s;o much terror and jealou&s;y, was of the Po|pi&s;h per&s;ua&s;ion. Though &s;everal of that &s;ect were in of|fice, they were men of mean abilities; and they even &s;eemed afraid of violence. The enthu&s;ia&s;m of the King was the great object of di&s;gu&s;t to the nation. The ap|propriation of all confidence to per&s;ons whom their re|ligious opinions only recommended, di&s;appointed men who, from a former po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power, were &s;till fond of office. The abilities of tho&s;e, working upon the fears of others, had actually di&s;armed James at home, before
<PB N="515" REF="543">
he was invaded from abroad. His wild projects were effectually defeated by a jury at London, before he was di&s;comfited by the terrors of a Dutch army. He had made the mo&s;t ample conce&s;&s;ions for the injuries done to the laws. He left the con&s;titution much better than he re|ceived it from his brother's hands. Nothing remained to confirm the liberties of the nation but the &s;anction of a parliament, who&s;e elections were now entirely independent of the will of the King.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and &s;itua|ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n of James.</NOTE> But his neglecting to call a parliament, however &s;pe|cious his excu&s;es might be to the contrary, ju&s;tly alarmed a people, who wi&s;hed to render them&s;elves &s;ecure again&s;t his future views, and, perhaps, again&s;t his re&s;entment. Men fore&s;aw, that, &s;hould James defeat the Prince of Orange in the field, he might either refu&s;e or adhere at plea&s;ure to his conce&s;&s;ions. Though they placed &s;ome confidence in his natural &s;incerity, they could never tru&s;t his enthu&s;ia&s;m. Their very prejudices again&s;t his religion &s;ugge&s;ted terrors, which proved fatal to his authority. They believed him capable of making a &s;how of yielding, to recover the power of doing more harm. Upon this principle was founded that general de&s;ertion which, with|out a&s;&s;igning this rea&s;on, might be deemed unaccountable, if not di&s;graceful. A more honourable conduct might certainly have e&s;tabli&s;hed liberty on a &s;olid foundation. Had the officers declared for a free parliament, in&s;tead of quitting their colours, when a foreign enemy was in the kingdom, a doubt can &s;carce be formed that the hands of James might be &s;ufficiently tied from effecting further mi&s;chief. An era of liberty might have commenced with|out the expence, or even danger of a change. The power of the crown might have been more circum&s;cribed than when the &s;ceptre was placed in the hands of the Prince of Orange. James had lo&s;t all influence among his &s;ub|jects, except that which he derived from the adherence of &s;ome to the line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Even the&s;e would have yielded to any regulation that &s;hould not deprive him of the name of King.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arguments for the Revolution.</NOTE> His flight to France, however, mu&s;t change the whole &s;tate of the argument. He was in the hands of a power|ful monarch, who&s;e ambition would take advantage of what chance had thrown in his way.

of England. To render James u&s;eful to his views, he might find it nece&s;&s;ary to aid him in the recovery of his former power. An army might be ea&s;ily tran&s;ported into the kingdom of a Prince already in his intere&s;t. The Prince of Orange, di&s;appointed in his ambition, would either leave the nation to their fate, or place the crown upon his own head by conque&s;t. Dangers threatened from every &s;ide. The nece&s;&s;ity of an immediate &s;ettlement was obvious. A foreign force was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the capi|tal. The national army was either di&s;per&s;ed, without a leader, or under the orders of the candidate for the crown. No re&s;ource remained, but to grant with a good grace what he otherwi&s;e might command for him&s;elf, or throw in di&s;gu&s;t, and without any terms, at the feet of his rival.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><MILESTONE N="1689" UNIT="year"> THOUGH Mary was comprehended in the royal title, &s;he neither po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the authority of a Queen, nor the influence of a wife. Her unambitious and ea&s;y temper had been long &s;ubdued by the &s;tern &s;everity of a hu&s;band, whom few of her &s;ex would admire. Habit had reconciled her mind to implicit obedience; and her pa&s;&s;ions, which were never &s;trong, had yielded to an opinion of duty. Removed from her native country and from her father when very young, her affections for both had greatly declined. Brought up in a manner under the tuition of her &s;pou&s;e, in &s;ome degree confined by his orders<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">D'Avaux, vol. iii.</NOTE>, accu&s;tomed to adopt his political maxims, and
<PB N="518" REF="546">
even his very thoughts, &s;urrounded by his creatures and per&s;ons of an inferior degree<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">D'Avaux, vol. iii.</NOTE>, he guided, with no diffi|culty, a mind which he him&s;elf had formed. In her want of importance with HIM, &s;he cea&s;ed to be an ob|ject of con&s;equence in the eyes of the nation. The whole authority of the crown was now ve&s;ted in Wil|liam, by the opinion of the people, as well as by the declaration of the convention. The conceit of &s;ubjoin|ing the name of Mary to her hu&s;band's title was a pu|erile &s;ubterfuge; and the circum&s;tance therefore de&s;erves no further attention in the hi&s;tory of the pre&s;ent reign.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Promotions.</NOTE> William began his reign with i&s;&s;uing a proclamation<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Feb. 14.</NOTE>, continuing in office all Prote&s;tants who had been in place on the fir&s;t of the preceding December. The eagerne&s;s with which the nation looked up to the new King's mea|&s;ures induced them to perceive a &s;ingularity in a paper of mere form. They ob&s;erved that a Prince, who had ju&s;t received the crown by the election of the people, ex|pre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, in the fir&s;t &s;entence of his fir&s;t public deed, as deriving his right from God. On the &s;eventeenth of the month he formed his privy-council. The li&s;t chiefly con&s;i&s;ted of &s;uch per&s;ons as had been mo&s;t active in rai&s;ing him to the throne<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Feb. 17.</NOTE>. To gratify as many as po&s;&s;ible of his friends, the &s;everal boards, and even the chancery, were put into commi&s;&s;ion. The benches of the Exchequer and common law were filled with per&s;ons who had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves again&s;t the mea&s;ures of the late King. The Earl of Nottingham, who had &s;o violently oppo&s;ed the elevation of William, and the Earl of Shrew&s;bury, who had adhered to his views, were made &s;ecretaries of &s;tate. The Marquis of Halifax and the Earl of Danby, though rivals in policy, were admitted into the cabinet. The fir&s;t as lord privy &s;eal, the latter as pre&s;ident of the council. His Dutch friends were not in the mean time forgot by the King. Bentinck, his fa|vourite, was made a privy-coun&s;ellor, groom of the &s;tole, and privy pur&s;e. Auverquerque was appointed ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e. Zuyli&s;tein received the office of ma&s;ter of the robes. Schomberg was placed at the head of the ord|nance<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">Kennet, Ralph, Gazette.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">William's fir&s;t &s;peech as King.</NOTE> Though the&s;e in&s;tances of gratitude were perhaps ne|ce&s;&s;ary to William, they were far from plea&s;ing the ge|nerality

of the nation. The prejudices of the people were &s;trong again&s;t foreigners. The Tories, who had departed from their principles to &s;erve the King, were offended at their being excluded from his favour. The&s;e di&s;contents ro&s;e only gradually, as the new appointments were made. While places remained vacant, the hopes of &s;ome kept in &s;ilence the whole. The fir&s;t advice de|manded by William of his privy-council was, Whether the convention might be legally converted into a parlia|ment? A majority having expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves in the affirmative, the King, for the fir&s;t time, went in &s;tate to the hou&s;e of lords on the eighteenth of February.&mdash;He told the two hou&s;es, in a &s;peech from the throne, that he was very &s;en&s;ible of their kindne&s;s. He a&s;&s;ured them, that he highly valued the confidence which they had repo&s;ed in his conduct; and that he was re&s;olved never to do any thing that might ju&s;tly le&s;&s;en their good opinion. He recommended to their care the perilous condition of Holland. He &s;hewed the nece&s;&s;ity of a good &s;ettlement at home. He repre&s;ented the dangers which threatened Ireland. He left it, he &s;aid, to them to con|&s;ider of the mo&s;t effectual means of preventing the in|conveniencies ari&s;ing from delays, and to judge of the forms mo&s;t proper to attain the good of the nation, which, on his part, he &s;hould be always ready to promote<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">Journals, Feb. 18.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The con|vention converted into a parlia|ment.</NOTE> William had &s;carce left the hou&s;e of lords, when a bill was brought in to prevent and remove all que&s;tions and di&s;putes concerning the a&s;&s;embling and &s;itting of the pre&s;ent parliament. The bill was read twice immediate|ly, and the next day<NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">Feb. 19.</NOTE> pa&s;&s;ed. The commons, in a committee of their whole hou&s;e, fell into a violent de|bate, <Q REND="inline">"Whether a King elected, by coming to and con&s;ulting with the lords and commons, did not con&s;ti|tute as complete a parliament as if &s;uch King had or|dered new elections to be made by writs."</Q> Several mem|bers in&s;i&s;ted, that the King's writs were as nece&s;&s;ary to form the legality of a parliament as his pre&s;ence. Some urged, from precedents, again&s;t this po&s;ition. Others, with more rea&s;on, affirmed, that the pre&s;ent &s;tate of af|fairs required expedition: and that after all the lo&s;s of time which &s;hould be incurred by the new election, the parliament would remain upon the &s;ame footing of lega|lity
<PB N="520" REF="548">
as before. The majority of the hou&s;e, afraid of the trouble of re-elections, &s;eemed to incline to the latter argument. The re&s;olve already mentioned was in the mean time brought down from the lords. The bill was read immediately for the fir&s;t time. Great oppo&s;ition was made. But the bill pa&s;&s;ed the hou&s;e on the twenty-&s;econd of February, and received the next day the royal a&s;&s;ent. The malecontents among the commons were &s;o much exa&s;perated, that they declared, in the cour&s;e of the debate, they would give no countenance, by &s;itting in it, to &s;uch an illegal parliament. They accordingly retired to the country, in appearance to adhere to their profe&s;&s;ions. But their enemies affirmed, that they only retired to avoid taking the oaths to the new King<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">Publications of the times.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Frugality of the com|mons.</NOTE> The &s;ame day that William gave his a&s;&s;ent to the act for converting the convention into a parliament, a motion was made in the hou&s;e of commons, for en|tering prior to the King's &s;peech, upon a con&s;ideration of grievances. A bill was brought in, for taking away the court holden before the council and pre&s;ident of Wales<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">Feb. 23.</NOTE>. But before the hou&s;e proceeded further in a line which circum&s;cribed the power of the crown, the adherents of the court prevailed, upon the ground of ne|ce&s;&s;ity, that the &s;peech &s;hould be fir&s;t con&s;idered. A que&s;tion was accordingly propo&s;ed, Whether the revenue was expired, or whether it devolved on the pre&s;ent King? The eagerne&s;s with which the commons rai&s;ed William to the throne &s;eemed to have already abated. The mi|ni&s;try urged with vehemence, that the revenue together with the crown devolved on their pre&s;ent Maje&s;ties. But the hou&s;e re&s;olved, notwith&s;tanding, that the revenue of the late King expired with his power. When this que&s;|tion was carried, the committee broke up abruptly. A motion was made when the hou&s;e was re&s;umed, that a revenue &s;hould be &s;ettled upon the King. Day after day the commons, under various pretences, avoided to come to a deci&s;ion. The crown, now de&s;titute of re|&s;ources, was in their power. They &s;eemed inclined to obtain tho&s;e &s;ecurities which they had neglected when they elected a new King. The nece&s;&s;ity of the times broke in part through this procra&s;tination of the com|mons. William acquainted the hou&s;e, by me&s;&s;age, that
<PB N="521" REF="549">
Ireland was threatened with a French inva&s;ion, under the late King. Four hundred and twenty thou&s;and pounds were voted to be levied by a monthly a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment; a &s;um as inadequate for the &s;ervice of the kingdom, as it was beneath the expectations of the King<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Feb. 28.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Habeas corpus</HI> act &s;u&s;pended.</NOTE> Notwith&s;tanding the frugality of the commons, they exhibited an in&s;tance of extraordinary complai&s;ance to William. They wanted upon him in a body, with an offer of their lives and fortunes in &s;upport of his alliances, in reducing Ireland, and in defending their religion and laws. Upon a me&s;&s;age from the King, they even con|de&s;cended to &s;u&s;pend, by a temporary bill, the <HI>habeas corpus</HI> act, the chief bulwark of the liberties of the &s;ub|ject. James him&s;elf never pre&s;umed to &s;top the opera|tions of this &s;alutary law, nor even demanded a &s;u&s;pen|&s;ion of it, by means of an ob&s;equious parliament, when a double rebellion &s;hook his kingdoms. The lords were &s;till more complai&s;ant than the commons. They ad|dre&s;&s;ed the King, to take an extraordinary care of go|vernment in the pre&s;ent conjuncture. They de&s;ired him to &s;ecure all di&s;affected per&s;ons; and they declared, not|with&s;tanding an expre&s;s law to the contrary, that he might retain per&s;ons &s;o committed to the fir&s;t day of the en&s;uing term. The commons, with &s;ome &s;pirit, refu&s;ed their concurrence to an addre&s;s that e&s;tabli&s;hed in the crown the di&s;pen&s;ing power, which they had recently con|demned. They &s;ent a bill to the upper hou&s;e, in an|&s;wer to their demand of a concurrence in their addre&s;s. The act of <HI>habeas corpus</HI> was &s;u&s;pended, by an expre&s;s law, till the &s;eventeenth of April, arming thus, in a con|&s;titutional way, the government with powers to protect it&s;elf.</P>

He urged that the latter could not be reduced without an immediate provi|&s;ion of an army of twenty thou&s;and men. In&s;tead of granting immediately the demanded aid, the commons re|&s;olved, the next day, to bring in a bill for appropriating, for little more than three months, the revenue paid to James to the &s;ervice of the crown. The expence of the Dutch expedition was &s;oon<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">March 14.</NOTE> after laid before the hou&s;e. The &s;um amounted to near &s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds.

The&s;e, by their emi&s;&s;aries, inflamed the prejudices of the people, and kept alive their fears. The Prince of Orange di&s;per&s;ed by their means his de|claration in Scotland. The zeal of the majority of the nation for the religious tenets of Calvin, had long pre|vailed over their attachment to the ancient line of their Kings. The Prince was of their own per&s;ua&s;ion, a cir|cum&s;tance which rendered him extremely popular. He had undertaken to deliver Scotland as well as England. He had di&s;avowed all &s;elfi&s;h de&s;igns in his expedition. The news of his landing in England was proclaimed in the we&s;tern counties with the greate&s;t demon&s;trations of joy. The army having marched by order to England, no power remained to repre&s;s the fury of the populace, or to protect the government.

The Marquis of Athol formed a party again&s;t the Earl of Perth, and forced him to re&s;ign his office. To facilitate the views of the Prince of Orange, they reduced, by their own authority, the few troops that remained in Scotland.

The vio|lence of the Duke for the Prince of Orange ro&s;e in proportion to his opinion, that James was never to re|turn.

This mea&s;ure was at fir&s;t di&s;appointed by the wavering di&s;po&s;ition of the Marquis of Athol, and afterwards, by the delay and folly of the party. The Marquis had re&s;umed his loyalty to James, on account of di&s;appointments from William. He was, however, irre&s;olute and fluctuating in his conduct. The time of the departure of the roy|ali&s;ts was deferred. An accident effectuated it at la&s;t with an abruptne&s;s which di&s;concerted all their views. The Vi&s;count Dundee, terrified with an information of a de&s;ign formed by the covenanters to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him, left Edinburgh, at the head of fifty hor&s;e. When he pa&s;&s;ed under the walls of the ca&s;tle, the Duke of Gor|don made a &s;ignal to call him to a conference. He &s;cramoled up again&s;t a precipice, and informed the Duke of all his de&s;igns. He conjured him to hold out the ca&s;tle, under a certainty of being relieved. The novelty of the &s;ight collected multitudes of &s;pectators. The convention were alarmed. The pre&s;ident ordered the doors to be locked, the keys to be laid on the table.

The Earl of Tyrconnel, having, by corrupt means, obtained the intere&s;t of Sunderland<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">James II. Mem. of Ireland.</NOTE>, was rai&s;ed, in the year 1687, to the government of that kingdom. Tyr|connel was a man of profligate abilities, violent in his temper, and, through &s;action more than religion, a bi|gotted Roman-catholic. His arrival in Ireland was at|tended with a general con&s;ternation among the Prote|&s;tants, and an intemperate joy among the Popi&s;h party. The fir&s;t dreaded a renewal of all the violence of former times. The latter, who formed a great majority of the nation, hoped to regain the importance of which they deemed them&s;elves unju&s;tly deprived. The new lord-deputy &s;eemed, by his conduct, to ju&s;tify, in a great mea&s;ure, the prior opinions of the people concern|ing his principles. Having received, on the twelfth of February, 1687, the &s;word of &s;tate from the Earl of Clarendon, he entered upon the exerci&s;e of his govern|ment. The army had already, in a great degree, been purged of the more obnoxious Prote&s;tants. The next mea&s;ure was to place the civil power in the hands of Papi&s;ts.

The Earl of Ca&s;tlemain had fixed his views on the government of Ireland; and both he and his party found means to convey the mi&s;managements of the lord-deputy to the King. Tyrconnel was again alarmed. To gain the favour of James through the channel of in|tere&s;t, he offered to his con&s;ideration a &s;cheme, which, though wild, unju&s;t, and dangerous, &s;eemed calculated to e&s;tabli&s;h his views.

To gain his protection and a&s;&s;ent to the bill, he complimented the King with the di&s;|po&s;al of almo&s;t all the lands in Ireland.

The Iri&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with contempt by the council.

The prudent remained quiet, though they en|tertained little hopes of being &s;oon relieved from their fears. In this &s;ituation affairs continued during the greate&s;t part of the memorable year 1688. A reitera|tion of an intention of altering the acts of &s;ettlement, mentioned by &s;ome writers, is neither well authenticated nor probable. When the Prince of Orange landed in England, the terrors of the Prote&s;tants were transferred to the Papi&s;ts. Though they fir&s;t affected to de&s;pi&s;e both the Prince and his inva&s;ion, the accounts of his &s;ucce&s;s and the misfortunes of James induced them to change their tone.

He boa&s;ted of the impartiality of his own government. The truth is, though he has been accu&s;ed of tyranny, few authentic facts have been pro|duced to ju&s;tify the charge. His manner was more blameable than his mea&s;ures.

The lords of the articles had been long deemed de&s;truc|tive to the fir&s;t principles of a free parliament; yet the abolition of that in&s;titution could not be obtained from the King. The ill humours of the parliament were, how|ever, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed for &s;ome time, on account of the dangers which threatened the new government.

He repre&s;&s;ed the jarring intere&s;ts and jealou&s;ies of the better &s;ort, by the authority of his character, and their high opinion of his courage and &s;kill in war.

One half of the &s;oldiers were armed with pikes. The other half had mu&s;kets, but utterly unfit for &s;ervice.

Two Engli&s;h regiments, under the command of the Colonels Cuningham and Richards, had arrived, a few days before, in Lake Foyle, upon which the town is &s;ituated. Lundy, who commanded in the place, was either &s;wayed by treachery or fear. Without permit|ting the men to land, he ordered the officers to come to a council of war. They &s;oon agreed, that the town was not tenable. Their re&s;olutions were communicated to the magi&s;trates, and they re&s;olved to offer terms to the King. The Engli&s;h regiments prepared to return. The populace were alarmed. Tumult, clamour, and confu&s;ion aro&s;e. The governor and magi&s;trates lo&s;t all authority. Some de&s;perate per&s;ons flew to the walls. They turned their cannon again&s;t the enemy, and fired. The garri&s;on cho&s;e two governors; Walker, a clergy|man, and one Major Baker.

equalled the &s;uppo&s;ed greatne&s;s of their aid. D'Avaux, as amba&s;&s;ador of France, exerted a kind of tyranny over a Prince whom he pretended to &s;upport. He was the declared enemy of the Prote&s;tants. His object was le&s;s to re&s;tore James, than to protract the war. The violence of the Roman Catholics ro&s;e in proportion to their &s;ucce&s;s. In their zeal for their own intere&s;ts, they paid little regard to tho&s;e of their unfortunate King. James had recommended &s;ome means of relief to the &s;ufferers by the acts of &s;ettlement; but the commons received a bill for the total repeal of the&s;e acts with a kind of barbarous joy. To a law which &s;ubverted the whole property of Ireland, James was forced, by the in&s;tances of D'Avaux and the violence of his parlia|ment, much again&s;t his own inclination<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">James II. 1689.</NOTE>, to a&s;&s;ent. This impolitic and precipitate mea&s;ure was followed by others equally unju&s;t and violent. The parliament pa&s;|&s;ed a general bill of attainder, which contained more than two thou&s;and per&s;ons of all orders and degrees. The Iri&s;h in the &s;ervice of King William, the Prote|&s;tants who left the kingdom, tho&s;e who returned not on the proclamation of King James, many who&s;e ordinary re&s;idence was in Britain, were attainted of high trea&s;on, and &s;ubjected to the pains of death and forfeiture, un|le&s;s they &s;urrendered them&s;elves to trial by a certain day. This act encroached upon the prerogative of the King. He was precluded from the power of pardoning, after the fir&s;t day of the &s;ucceeding November. Neither James nor the per&s;ons affected knew the whole extent of this rigorous bill. The act was kept concealed in the cu&s;tody of the chancellor. The King, four months after, learned by an accident the force of a law which &s;o much intrenched on his own prerogative<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Ibid.

To render Ireland totally independent of England, was an object which occupied the next care of this violent parliament. They declared, by an expre&s;s bill, that the Engli&s;h parliament had no power to bind Ireland; and
<PB N="564" REF="594">
that writs of error or appeal &s;hould be no longer pro&s;e|cuted in England. They pa&s;&s;ed a bill for a general li|berty of con&s;cience. They recalled the provi&s;ions &s;et|tled on mini&s;ters in towns corporate. They appropri|ated to the Popi&s;h clergy the eccle&s;ia&s;tical dues and tythes payable by per&s;ons of their own per&s;ua&s;ion. Notwith&s;tanding the bigotry of James, he was far from being plea&s;ed with the violent proceedings of the Roman Catholic party. Oppre&s;&s;ed by the importunities of his &s;ubjects, intimidated by D'Avaux, who threatened to retire to France, in ca&s;e of the King's refu&s;al to gratify the Papi&s;ts, he yielded, in a degree incon&s;i&s;tent with his declarations. He, however, &s;hewed at length &s;ome at|tention to the Engli&s;h intere&s;t. He refu&s;ed to con&s;ent to the repeal of Poyning's law. He would not permit inns of court, for the education of law-&s;tudents, to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in Ireland. This ob&s;tinacy, as it was called by his enemies, e&s;tranged from him the minds of the more violent Papi&s;ts. Be&s;ides, a faction, headed by the Duke of Tyrconnel, were in clo&s;e corre&s;pondence with the court of France. They knew that James de&s;igned only to pa&s;s through their country to his other domi|nions. They were afraid that the aver&s;ion which he had already di&s;covered to the independence of Ireland, might induce him, &s;hould he happen to be re&s;tored, to &s;ubvert the violent regulations which they had already made. Some even formed a project of re&s;igning the &s;overeignty of their country to Lewis the Fourteenth. Their com|plaints of the conduct of their &s;overeign at the court of France, e&s;tabli&s;hes &s;ome kind of proof of this fact. James was peculiarly unfortunate. He was charged by the Prote&s;tants of violence in favour of the Papi&s;ts: he was accu&s;ed by the Papi&s;ts of too much lenity to the Prote&s;tants<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">MS. 1689.</NOTE>.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1689" UNIT="year"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">State of the nation.</NOTE> THE &s;ucce&s;s of William in the fir&s;t compaign of his reign was neither an&s;werable to the expectations of the nation, nor adequate to the &s;upplies granted by parliament. His fleet had been wor&s;ted at &s;ea by an enemy, who&s;e power on that element had been hitherto de&s;pi&s;ed. His army at land had been defeated by a few half-armed irregulars, who carried nothing fit for war, except courage, to the field. While the Engli&s;h and Dutch navies lay, with di&s;ea&s;ed crews, in a &s;tate of in|activity on the coa&s;t of France, the narrow &s;eas &s;warm|ed with the privateers of the enemy, who interrupted the trade of the kingdom, and enriched them&s;elves with im|punity. The efforts again&s;t James in Ireland were ob|&s;tructed fir&s;t by unaccountable delays; and they were
<PB N="576" REF="606">
afterwards rendered ineffectual, either through the ava|rice or negligence of the &s;ervants of the crown. The&s;e misfortunes, however, ought not wholly to be laid to the account of William. The un&s;ettled &s;tate of parties at home prevented him from giving &s;ufficient attention to affairs abroad. He was a &s;tranger in the country in which he reigned. His mini&s;ters were either ignorant, or employed in dome&s;tic faction. His army was new to action. His navy was ill-provided; and his own moro&s;e and &s;ullen temper had cooled in many their late zeal for his &s;ervice<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">Burnet.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Several bi|&s;hops refu&s;e the oaths.</NOTE> Want of &s;ucce&s;s in his military operations was not the only circum&s;tances that rendered William unea&s;y on his throne. During the interval of parliament, the oaths of allegiance to the new government were to be taken. Many of the clergy cho&s;e rather to incur &s;u&s;pen&s;ion than to comply. Several le&s;s &s;crupulous took the oaths with a kind of temporizing re&s;erve. Five of the &s;even bi&s;hops, whom James had committed to the Tower, were of the number of nonjurors. This powerful &s;chi&s;m in the church di&s;turbed the King and di&s;tracted his government. The opinions of many of the people followed the &s;cruples of the clergy. Surmi&s;es again&s;t William's attachment to the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion were propagated and received with ardour. The abolition of epi&s;copacy in Scotland was produced as a proof even of his enmity to the church of England. He was accu&s;ed of favouring mo&s;t tho&s;e who were known to have the greate&s;t aver&s;ion to the mode of wor&s;hip appointed by law. The&s;e in&s;inuations had great weight with the church in general. In the two univer&s;ities, e&s;pecially in Oxford, they were receiv|ed for matter of fact, without any di&s;pute.

The violence of a Popi&s;h parliament was a&s;cribed to the enthu&s;ia&s;m of a Popi&s;h King. The breach upon the acts of &s;ettlement, the cruelties of De Ro&s;en, the vehemence of D'Avaux, the complaints and real grievances of the Prote&s;tants, the mi&s;eries of a civil war, in a country, where the contending parties were in|flamed with religious zeal, were laid all to the account of James. Men could not di&s;tingui&s;h between the name of authority and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power. They were ig|norant that the unfortunate King had been &s;ubdued by his nominal friends, when he made a &s;hew of re&s;i&s;tance to his enemies. In their certain knowledge of his at|tachment to the Romi&s;h faith, they di&s;tru&s;ted all his mea|&s;ures. The breaches made by others upon his declara|tions in favour of the Prote&s;tants, were attributed to his own enthu&s;ia&s;m.

The Whigs, to whom William owed his throne, were &s;evere upon his prerogative. Di&s;appointed in their views of an exclu&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power, they founded an oppo&s;ition to the crown upon &s;pecious grounds. In re&s;toring the corporations to their former rights, they endeavoured to animadvert upon tho&s;e who had been in&s;trumental in &s;urrendering the charters in the two la&s;t reigns. They incorporated together the bills of indemnity, and pains and penalties. They carried upon every occa&s;ion their re&s;entment into pa&s;t times; and, in wounding the influence of the Tories, attacked the power of the crown. William, with a pa&s;&s;ion not un|natural to Kings, deemed every encroachment upon the royal prerogative an inju&s;tice to him&s;elf.

He came to the hou&s;e of lords on the twenty-&s;eventh of January, and prorogued the parliament to the &s;econd of April. The prorogation, by putting an end to &s;ome favourite bills, di&s;concerted and di&s;plea&s;ed the Whigs.

A treaty was reported to have been &s;ettled with the late King, by the whole cabal. But this &s;eems to have been one of the many fictions of party. The wrath of the Whigs was, however, equal to their di&s;appointment. They carried their complaints to the pre&s;s. In animadverting upon the Tories, they taxed the King with ingratitude, as well as imprudence. Their arguments were as un&s;uc|ce&s;sful as their plan of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an exclu&s;ive power. Having failed in pa&s;&s;ing the corporation-act, with the projected amendments, the court retained its influence in the new elections.

To this victory over their political opponents the Tories added a con&s;iderable advantage of another kind. The lieutenancy of London was placed in the hands of tho&s;e who had held it in the reign of James. Compton, Bi&s;hop of London, who had been a Whig again&s;t James, became a Tory to William.

Tories, a violent majority appeared again&s;t his mea&s;ures in the parliament of Scotland. The ill-humour which had produced the remon&s;trance in the preceding year, had been augmented by the re&s;entment with which William received that paper. The meeting of an in|flamed a&s;&s;embly was dangerous; to prorogue them for any length of time, inconvenient; and to di&s;&s;olve them in the pre&s;ent di&s;tractions, imprudent. The King en|deavoured, in the mean time, to gain over the heads of the adver&s;e party, by putting into commi&s;&s;ion the prin|cipal offices in the &s;tate. Few were &s;atisfied with what they received. The di&s;appointed were rendered out|rageous. The Lord Melvil, a man un&s;uitable to trou|ble&s;ome times, was appointed commi&s;&s;ioner to the par|liament, which was appointed to meet on the fir&s;t of March. Terrified at the &s;tate of opinions, he prevailed with William to adjourn them from time to time.

The adherents of James derived hopes from the expected confu&s;ion; and many took the oaths to the new government, to furni&s;h them&s;elves with an opportu|nity of breaking their &s;olemn engagements with advan|tage to their favoured cau&s;e<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">Balcarras.</NOTE>. The mo&s;t violent of the Pre&s;byterians, offended at the re&s;ervation of patro|nage made by the King, in the propo&s;ed e&s;tabli&s;hment of the church, joined them&s;elves to the Jacobites; and this coalition, though formed of &s;uch heterogeneous ma|terials as could promi&s;e no permanency, filled the new government with apprehen&s;ions.</P>

His de|&s;ign, however, was to deceive both parties. To the Pre&s;byterians, he averred, that the adherents of the late King would join with them in all their views to ruin Melvil and Stair.

To the encroachments of his own &s;ect he had nothing but the feeble aid of proclamations to oppo&s;e. The Ca|tholics denied utterly his &s;upremacy in eccle&s;ia&s;tical af|fairs; and thus he found his prerogative dimini&s;hed by a faith to which he had imprudently &s;acrificed his crown. The Engli&s;h army, in the mean time lay in their winter quarters, expo&s;ed to &s;ickne&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">William in Ireland.</NOTE> William left London on the fourth of June. He ar|rived at Carrickfergus on the fourteenth. He pa&s;&s;ed from thence to Li&s;burn, the head quarters of the Duke of Schomberg. He reviewed at Loughbrickland his army, which con&s;i&s;ted of thirty-&s;ix thou&s;and men. This great force was formed of various nations, Engli&s;h, Dutch, Germans, Danes, and French. Supplied with every ne|ce&s;&s;ary, healthy, vigorous, and fit for the field, their zeal and courage &s;eemed equal to the ab&s;olute certainty of victory which they entertained in their own minds. The Iri&s;h army having abandoned Ardee at the approach of William, fell back to the &s;outh of the Boyne. On the banks of that river they were joined by James, who had marched from Dublin at the head of his French auxiliaries. The banks of the Boyne were &s;teep. The &s;outh &s;ide was hilly, and &s;trengthened by ditches. The river it&s;elf was deep, and it ro&s;e very high with the tide. The&s;e advan|tages induced James to re&s;olve, again&s;t the advice of his officers, to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that po&s;t. His army was inferior in numbers, in di&s;cipline, in every thing to the enemy. Flight would di&s;pirit his troops and tarni&s;h his own reputation. He therefore determined to throw at once on the i&s;&s;ue of a battle the fate of the Iri&s;h.

his troops in two lines, oppo&s;ed to the deep and dangerous fords of the Boyne. A mora&s;s defended him on the left. In his rear lay the village of Dunore. Three miles behind was the narrow pa&s;s of Duleek, calculated equally to retard, and to cover his retreat. William, having in per&s;on examined from the oppo&s;ite &s;hore the po&s;ition of the enemy, re&s;olved, contrary to the advice of Schomberg, to attack them the next day. He formed his army in three columns. The right, under the Count de Schomberg and Douglas, was ordered to pa&s;s near the bridge of Slane. The center, commanded by the Duke of Schomberg, was directed to force the fords in the front of the enemy. The King him&s;elf led the left to a fordable part in the Boyne, between his camp and the town of Drogheda. Young Schomberg was the fir&s;t in motion. He pa&s;&s;ed the river. He attempted the mora&s;s. The left wing of the Iri&s;h were in a manner &s;urpri&s;ed, and they retreated. The center, commanded by the Duke, pa&s;&s;ed the fords with little interruption. The Dutch guards formed gradually on the bank, and then advanced. The Iri&s;h infantry de&s;cended from the ri&s;ing grounds on the enemy. But they in&s;tantly de&s;erted their officers. The cavalry behaved with more &s;pirit. They broke a body of Danes, and drove them into the river. They threw into confu&s;ion the French Prote&s;tants. They were however repul&s;ed with &s;laughter by the Dutch. But they had the fortune of killing Schomberg when they retreated along the line<NOTE N="U" PLACE="foot">Ralph, Leland, Life of James II.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">James de|feated.</NOTE> When the right of the enemy, under young Schomberg, forced the pa&s;&s;age of the river, they &s;tretched their line to the right.

King James, be|lieving the main body of the Engli&s;h were following their right, had weakened his own right wing and center, by reinforcing Lau&s;un.

In the mean time the whole line of the Engli&s;h began to move towards their right. King James, afraid of their getting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pa&s;s of Duleek, and cutting off his retreat from Dublin, marched al&s;o towards his left. The defeat of his right was no longer a &s;ecret. Several of the &s;cattered and wounded hor&s;emen mixed them&s;elves in their flight with his line. When they arrived at the pa&s;s of Duleek, the Count de Lau&s;un earne&s;tly entreated James to make the be&s;t of his way to Dublin. He affirmed that the enemy, who were &s;o &s;trong in hor&s;e, might make detachments, and po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of the capital.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections.</NOTE> The French auxiliaries, forming them&s;elves in the rear of the Iri&s;h army, pre&s;ented &s;o good a countenance to the enemy, that they were &s;uffered to pa&s;s quietly through the pa&s;s of Duleek. They even carried away five of the &s;ix field-pieces that attended the left wing. But when night came, the panic of the Iri&s;h increa&s;ed. The greate&s;t part of the troops di&s;per&s;ed. The French only adhered to their colours. Such was the pa&s;&s;age, rather than the battle, of the Boyne. No action promi&s;ed to be more important in its con&s;equences. None &s;eems le&s;s remark|able for either the conduct of the leaders or the valour of the troops. In the &s;pirit of the undertaking lies Wil|liam's greate&s;t prai&s;e. The improvidence of James was equal to the cowardice of his army. The fir&s;t &s;eemed wantonly to ri&s;k every thing without any apparent nece&s;|&s;ity. The latter was prepo&s;terou&s;ly cautious, while he &s;carce had any thing further to lo&s;e. William may be blamed for knowing &s;o little of the ground through which his attacks were to be led. James was unpardonable for not availing him&s;elf of what fortune had thrown in his hands. But one King de&s;pi&s;ed too much his enemies. The other was perplexed with a di&s;tru&s;t of his friends. Had the authority of James prevailed over the pride of the Iri&s;h, he might perhaps have involved his rival in tho&s;e difficulties which fell afterwards with &s;o much weight on him&s;elf. By oppo&s;ing the French auxiliaries, in&s;tead of the Iri&s;h, to the center of the enemy, he might have cut to pieces the main body, incumbered as they were in a deep river, with difficult banks, before they could de|rive any aid from either of their wings.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">King James flies to France.</NOTE> When James arrived at Dublin, he found letters from his Queen, and an account of the victory obtained by the French at Fleurus over the Prince of Waldec. Encou|raged by this intelligence, he began to li&s;ten to the advice of his friends, who unanimou&s;ly concurred in reque&s;ting him to retire to France. When he was mounting his hor&s;e, the French general officers arrived, and ha&s;tened his flight, by informing him that even the French troops them&s;elves were di&s;per&s;ed in &s;earch of provi&s;ions.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Projects of that king|dom in his favour.</NOTE> The precipitate flight of James from Ireland ruined his reputation as well as his affairs. When he landed in France, he &s;oon perceived the pernicious effects of that mea&s;ure, and repented &s;incerely of his own conduct. The French King had formed the mo&s;t effectual plans for his &s;ervice. That Prince was ma&s;ter at &s;ea ever &s;ince the battle of Bantry-bay. By the victory at Fleurus he was confe&s;&s;edly &s;uperior to his enemies at land. He had ordered a fleet to &s;ail, not only capable to engage, but, as it afterwards proved, to defeat the combined force of the maritime powers. He de&s;igned at the &s;ame time to &s;end a &s;quadron of twenty-five frigates to St. George's channel, to burn all the &s;hips on both &s;ides but &s;uch as &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary to tran&s;port King James and &s;ome troops to England.

Limerick could be only approached on one &s;ide, through a pa&s;s &s;carce one hundred and fifty yards in breadth, flanked on either &s;ide with impa&s;&s;able bogs. Be&s;ides, a &s;mall fort from a ri&s;ing ground com|manded the pa&s;s, which was it&s;elf incumbered with hedges and old walls.</P>

Two guns happened to re|ceive no damage. The&s;e were brought to the camp. Other pieces of artillery were tran&s;ported from Waterford. A breach was made in the wall. William ordered the town to be &s;tormed, on the twenty-&s;eventh of Augu&s;t. He was, however, repul&s;ed with great lo&s;s. The very women defended the breach. Five hundred Engli&s;h, be|&s;ides the foreigners, who&s;e lo&s;s was con&s;iderable, lay dead on the &s;pot. More than double the number of the &s;lain were wounded. William was di&s;concerted beyond mea|&s;ure at this unexpected check. He &s;ent a drummer to demand a truce for the burial of the dead. The Iri&s;h refu&s;ed, in a haughty manner, his reque&s;t.

When the &s;ituation of that Prince&s;s brought her forward to public view, her good qualities appeared with con&s;iderable advantage. The prejudices which the peculiarity of her &s;ituation had rai&s;ed again&s;t her humanity, were much le&s;&s;ened by an ea&s;y acce&s;s to her per&s;on, and the &s;oftne&s;s of her manners. In political addre&s;s &s;he &s;eemed not to be defi|cient; and the fame of her prudence ro&s;e among the people in proportion to their prior want of information concerning her real character. The part which &s;he had to act was difficult. The times were critical and dange|rous. Her council was formed, almo&s;t in equal num|bers, of the two irreconcileable parties, the Whigs and the Tories. A powerful enemy pre&s;&s;ed the nation from abroad. Di&s;contents, factions, and even con&s;piracies, prevailed at home. Though the &s;upplies for the navy had been ample, the preparations for equipping the fleet were languid; and the kingdom, through the ne|gligence of government, or the de&s;ign of &s;ome of its &s;ervants, &s;eemed to lie expo&s;ed to inva&s;ion, and even to conque&s;t.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The fleets at &s;ea.</NOTE> Certain intelligence of the equipment of a powerful fleet in the ports of France had arrived in England, be|fore William's departure for Ireland. The Earl of Torrington had hoi&s;ted his flag in the Downs, as com|mander of the fleet, on the thirtieth of May. He ar|rived at St. Helen's on the fourteenth of June. The Dutch fleet, under Evertzen, having joined the Engli&s;h, the admiral weighed anchor on the twenty-third; and propo&s;ed to wait at Duno&s;e, at the back of the I&s;le of Wight, for the French fleet, which had appeared, on the twentieth, before Plymouth. The French, in point of numbers and in the &s;ize of the &s;hips, were &s;uperior

to the combined fleet of the allies; and therefore Tor|rington had re&s;olved not to engage the enemy in the open &s;eas. He was, however forced to depart from his purpo&s;e, by the expre&s;s orders of the Queen. The enemy had been in &s;ight for five days: but the Engli&s;h admiral made &s;uch u&s;e of the winds and tides, that he eluded all the efforts of the French to bring him to bat|tle. The two fleets lay off Beachy-head. The morn|ning after Torrington had received orders to fight, he gave the &s;ignal, as &s;oon as day appeared, for forming the line. The wind was ea&s;terly. He bore down upon the enemy. The Dutch formed the van, and were engag|ed with the van of the French about eight of the clock in the morning.

The Dutch behaved with the utmo&s;t courage. The mo&s;t of their &s;hips were di&s;|abled. Three of their line of battle were &s;unk in the engagement. Three more were burnt in the flight. They lo&s;t many men. Two of their admirals, and &s;e|veral captains, were &s;lain. The Engli&s;h who were en|gaged &s;uffered extremely from the enemy. The French &s;hips were well manned.

Their want of experience, and ig|norance of the cour&s;e of the tides, deprived them of a great part of the advantage which their arms had gain|ed.

They returned on the twenty-fir&s;t of July, and anchored in Torbay. The panic, which had been &s;u&s;pended by their departure, was renewed upon their return. The militia was ordered to the coa&s;t. A camp was formed near Torbay. Terror, confu&s;ion, and cla|mour, prevailed every where. The fears of the nation were, however, found to be &s;uperfluous in the event.

Elated with this trivial exploit, they &s;ailed toward Bre&s;t, on the fourth of Au|gu&s;t. Torrington retired after the battle to the mouth of the Thames. Having left the command to Sir John A&s;by, he him&s;elf returned to London. The whole city was in the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation. The panic of the people was trans&s;erred to the government.

When the fears of the nation were di&s;&s;ipated by the final retreat of the French fleet to their own coa&s;t, the Earl of Marlborough prevailed with the Queen and her council to permit him to lead five thou&s;and men from England, on an expedition again&s;t Cork and Kin&s;ale.&mdash;On the twenty-fir&s;t of September, 1690, he arrived be|fore

the former place; and two days after landed all his troops. Ginckle, who had &s;ucceeded Solmes in the command of the army in Ireland, detached near a thou|&s;and hor&s;e to the aid of Marlborough; and &s;oon after he had opened his trenches before Cork, he was rein|forced with four thou&s;and Danes, under the Duke of Wirtemberg. The &s;iege, already carried on with &s;uc|ce&s;s, was in &s;ome degree retarded by a di&s;pute about the command, between the Duke and the Earl. A breach was however made in the wall. The be&s;iegers prepar|ed for a general a&s;&s;ault. The ammunition of the gar|ri&s;on being exhau&s;ted, they &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri|&s;oners of war. Though the &s;ea&s;on was far advanced, Kin&s;ale was &s;ummoned. The Iri&s;h governor re&s;olved to defend the fort to the la&s;t extremity. He burnt the town, as untenable. He retired to the old and new fort. The fir&s;t was taken after a gallant defence. The &s;iege of the &s;econd was pre&s;&s;ed with vigour. In ten days the place capitulated. The garri&s;on were permitted to re|tire to Limerick, with all the honours of war; and Marlborough, having accompli&s;hed the object of his ex|pedition, &s;ent his troops to winter-quarters, and return|ed to England<NOTE N="X" PLACE="foot">Lediord. vol. i.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Unparalleled</NOTE> Though the winter &s;u&s;pended the regular operations of war, the mi&s;eries of Ireland increa&s;ed during that &s;ea|&s;on. Ginckle having neglected to form a regular line of troops along the Shannon, the enemy cro&s;&s;ed that ri|ver in parties, and frequently beat up his quarters with &s;ucce&s;s. The French having retired to Galway, to wait for a pa&s;&s;age home, the whole weight of their own de|fence devolved on the native Iri&s;h. De&s;pair and animo|&s;ity had at the beginning &s;eized their minds. Their &s;uc|ce&s;s again&s;t William at Limerick had lately added to their confidence and courage. In their excur&s;ions again&s;t the enemy, they &s;pread mi&s;ery, ruin, and de&s;olation over the whole country. The inhabitants were plundered. Their hou&s;es and cabins were burnt to the ground. The Engli&s;h and their auxiliaries and mercenaries yielded not to their enemies in this de&s;tructive and mercile&s;s mode of war.</P>

An improve|ment on the barbari&s;m of their predece&s;&s;ors impo&s;ed upon them a new name. They were called Rapparees, from the Iri&s;h name of a pike, with which they ma&s;&s;acred in|di&s;criminately the unfortunate per&s;ons who fell into their hands. They hovered on the &s;kirts of the Engli&s;h ar|my. They hara&s;&s;ed them with pur&s;uits. They cut off their &s;tragglers. They &s;urrounded their quarters with murder and de&s;olation. To repel the fury of the&s;e a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;ins, the Engli&s;h e&s;tabli&s;hed marauders of a &s;imilar kind. In inju&s;tice and cruelty they yielded not to their infamous opponents.

A privy council was formed of men at|tached to the reigning King. They, however, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed little authority. Their power was contemned by the army. The &s;oldiers owned no &s;uperiors but the milita|ry officers. They di&s;regarded even the&s;e, when their or|ders interfered with their own rapacity. The winter was throughout di&s;graced with acts of barbarity on both &s;ides. The year 1691, in its fir&s;t months, produced no memorable event. Tyrconnel, though &s;tript of his cha|racter of chief governor by James, had returned from France with a pitiful &s;um of money, to maintain the Iri&s;h war. Yielding to de&s;pondence, or &s;wayed by his di&s;grace, he endeavoured to induce the Iri&s;h to &s;ubmit to the new government, upon terms. This mea&s;ure was oppo&s;ed by Sarsfield, who had acquired &s;o much re|putation for his exploits in the former campaign. Quar|rels and animo&s;ities prevailed. To put an end to di&s;|putes which threatened his intere&s;t in Ireland with ruin,

James conferred the chief command on St. Ruth, a French general of experience and reputation. That of|ficer arrived in Ireland; but he was furni&s;hed with none of the nece&s;&s;aries of war. De&s;titute of pay, in want of provi&s;ions, without &s;tores, and ill provided with am|munition, a great part of the army had been forced to di&s;per&s;e. St. Ruth found him&s;elf obliged, by the bad &s;tate of his troops, to act upon the defen&s;ive; and, hav|ing placed a &s;trong garri&s;on in Athlone, he re&s;olved to wait for the enemy on the further &s;ide of the Shannon<NOTE N="Z" PLACE="foot">Auct. citat. pa&s;&s;im.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Athlone be|&s;ieged.</NOTE> Ginckle, &s;upplied with every thing nece&s;&s;ary to open the campaign with vigour, ordered his troops to rendez|vous at Mullingar. He decamped from that place on the &s;ixth of June; and having, with little difficulty, oblig|ed the garri&s;on of Ballymore to &s;urrender, he advanced toward Athlone. His army con&s;i&s;ted of twenty thou&s;and men. Having pa&s;&s;ed through dangerous and narrow de|files without any oppo&s;ition, he arrived, on the nine|teenth of June, before the place. Athlone, as well as Limerick, is divided by the Shannon. It was &s;trongly garri&s;oned and tolerably fortified. The Iri&s;h army lay behind the town, on the &s;ide of Connaught. Ginckle, having fini&s;hed his batteries, con&s;i&s;ting of ten eighteen pounders, began to play on the ba&s;tion next the river toward Lane&s;borough, in the night of the twentieth of June. A practicable breach was made in a few hours.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Athlone taken.</NOTE> Ginckle played ince&s;&s;antly upon the Iri&s;h town. He expended twelve thou&s;and bullets and &s;ix hundred bombs in the &s;pace of ten days. The place was reduced to a heap of rubbi&s;h. The Iri&s;h continued ob&s;tinate. Hav|ing had &s;ome advantage over the enemy, by burning their bridge of boats, they were lulled into a fatal &s;e|curity. On the thirtieth of June, Ginckle &s;uddenly en|tering the river in columns, &s;urpri&s;ed the town. Little re&s;i&s;tance was made by the Iri&s;h; and all that fell in the way of the a&s;&s;ailants were put to the &s;word. The boldne&s;s and vigilance of Ginckle could be only equall|ed by the negligence of the Iri&s;h. Hi&s;tory can &s;carce furni&s;h a parallel to the &s;ucce&s;s of an undertaking which

&s;eemed in it&s;elf impracticable. A fortified town attacked acro&s;s a river, &s;u&s;tained behind by a con&s;iderable army, was taken in le&s;s than a quarter of an hour by an army of three thou&s;and men, who were brea&s;t-high in water when they advanced to the breach<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">MS. Journal 1691.</NOTE>. St. Ruth, when informed of the a&s;&s;ault, could &s;carce give any credit to the intelligence. He however, ordered &s;ome battalions to &s;u&s;tain the be&s;ieged; but the &s;uccours came too late. The works of the town toward his camp were entire. The enemy had already lined the walls, and repul&s;ed the Iri&s;h from their own works<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Aghrim.</NOTE> St. Ruth, covered with &s;hame at his own negligence, decamped without beat of drum in the night. Having marched ten miles from Athlone, he po&s;ted him&s;elf at Agh|rim, determined to recover his own reputation or to lo&s;e the kingdom, in one deci&s;ive battle. To augment his army, he had withdrawn the garri&s;ons from Sligo, Lane&s;|borough, and James-town. Ginckle followed his example in reinforcing his army with all his detached parties. Having remained ten days at Athlone, he marched into Ro&s;common, and encamped along the river Suc. The Iri&s;h army extended their line more than two miles on the ri&s;ing grounds of Kilcommeden. The &s;lope before them was lined with hedges and ditches. A bog defended their front. Mora&s;&s;es &s;kirted their right and left. On the twelfth of July, Ginckle determined to attack the enemy. St. Ruth marked his motions from the eminence, and form|ed his own line. He exhibited in his di&s;po&s;itions all the conduct of an experienced officer. He rode along the line. He directed every thing, he animated his troops with words calculated to confirm their courage and to rou&s;e their minds. The &s;trength of the ground, the ardour of his men, his excellent di&s;po&s;itions, the ra&s;hne&s;s of the enemy, who &s;eemed determined to advance, filled him him with every hope of victory<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Ralph, Burnet, Leland. Mem. of Ireland.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iri&s;h defeat|ed.</NOTE> Ginckle, having cro&s;&s;ed the Suc without oppo&s;ition, advanced to the mora&s;s in the front of the enemy. One pa&s;s led to their camp on the right; another, by the ca&s;tle of Aghrim, to the left. The fir&s;t was ordered to be at|tacked. It was gained, after much re&s;i&s;tance. The &s;pirit of the enemy, and the difficulties of the ground, induced
<PB N="620" REF="653">
Ginckle to &s;u&s;pend his de&s;ign to engage. But, to prevent the retreat of the enemy, he again changed his mind. The pa&s;s on the left was attacked, at five in the evening. General Mackay, in the mean time, plunged into the bog with the center, and advanced again&s;t the enemy. He was received, however, with &s;uch warmth, that his men were forced to retreat. St. Ruth, beholding this advan|tage, was elevated with the hopes of victory. The Eng|li&s;h cavalry, having forced the pa&s;s on the left, advanced in full &s;peed on the flank of the pur&s;uing Iri&s;h. The fu|gitives rallied, formed, and advanced. The battle &s;eemed to hang in equal &s;cales, when it was &s;uddenly decided by fortune. St. Ruth, de&s;cending from the hill, advanced with a &s;quadron of hor&s;e to &s;u&s;tain his foot, and attack the Engli&s;h cavalry. When he was on the point of coming to blows with the enemy, he was killed by a cannon-ball. The &s;pirit of the Iri&s;h fell with their leader. Sarsfield, the next in command, was not &s;tationed where his pre|&s;ence was mo&s;t required. Confu&s;ion, di&s;order, and terror, &s;pread from wing to wing. The Iri&s;h, on the point of being victors, re&s;igned them&s;elves to panic and flight. Many were &s;lain in the battle, but more in bloody pur|&s;uit of three miles. Several thou&s;ands of the vanqui&s;hed were killed. The victors lo&s;t &s;even hundred men. The crown of Ireland depended on the opportune fall of St. Ruth. His death &s;natched victory from his hands; and, by breaking the power of the Catholics, le&s;&s;ened their mi&s;eries, by deciding &s;ooner their fate. Ginckle gained reputation by the action; but his army lo&s;t every claim to humanity, by giving no quarter<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">Mem. of Ireland, Leland, Ralph.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Galway &s;ur|renders.</NOTE> The bulk of the Iri&s;h fugitives retired to Limerick, after the battle of Aghrim. Ginckle, having refre&s;hed his army a few days, advanced to Galway. He &s;at down before that place on the nineteenth of July. Galway, though garri&s;oned with &s;even regiments, was not provided with the means of defence. Ginckle, wi&s;hing to end the war, permitted the Iri&s;h to retire to Limerick. He him|&s;elf advanced toward that place. He &s;at down before it on the twenty-fifth of Augu&s;t. Contention, di&s;cord, con|fu&s;ion prevailed within the walls. Some were for &s;ur|rendering upon terms for them&s;elves; others, upon con|ditions, in favour of their whole party. The majority,
<PB N="621" REF="654">
headed by the French officers, re&s;olved to hold Limerick to the la&s;t extremity. The &s;ucce&s;sful defence of the place in the preceding year animated them with hopes of the &s;ame good fortune. Succours were expected from France. A fleet of twenty &s;ail was already on the way, with men, provi&s;ions, ammunition, and money. The de&s;pair of the pro&s;cribed Catholics inflamed their minds again&s;t an enemy who had &s;hewn &s;o little humanity in the late battle. Tyrconnel, who had uniformly propo&s;ed &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, had died a few days before, in Limerick. Sarsfield, his po|litical opponent, loved war, on account of its dangers; and the generals d'O&s;&s;one and de Te&s;&s;e were re&s;olved, for the benefit of their country, to continue, as long as po&s;|&s;ible, the di&s;traction among her enemies<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">Auct citat. pa&s;&s;im.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Siege of Li|merick.</NOTE> The particulars of the &s;econd &s;iege of Limerick are neither important nor di&s;tinctly known. Six weeks were &s;pent before the place, without any deci&s;ive effect. The gar|ri&s;on was well &s;upplied with provi&s;ions. They were provided with all means of defence. The &s;ea&s;on was now far advan|ced. The rains had &s;et in. The winter it&s;elf was near. Ginckle had received orders to fini&s;h the war upon any terms. The di&s;&s;entions between the French and Iri&s;h were renewed with redoubled fury. The Engli&s;h general offered conditions, which the Iri&s;h, had they even been victors, could &s;carce refu&s;e with prudence. He agreed, that all in arms &s;hould receive their pardon; That their e&s;tates &s;hould be re&s;tored, their attainders annulled, their outlawries rever&s;ed: That none &s;hould be liable for debts incurred through deeds done in the cour&s;e of ho&s;tilities: That all Roman Catholics &s;hould enjoy the &s;ame tolera|tion, with regard to their religion, as in the reign of Charles the Second: That the gentry &s;hould be permitted to make u&s;e of arms: That the inferior &s;ort &s;hould be allowed to exerci&s;e their callings and profe&s;&s;ions: That no oaths, but that of allegiance, &s;hould be required of high or low: That &s;hould the troops, or any number of them, chu&s;e to retire into any foreign &s;ervice, they &s;hould be conveyed to the continent, at the expence of the King. Sarsfield, who had obtained the title of Earl of Lucan from James after his abdication, was permitted to retain a dignity which the laws could not recognize<NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">Articles of capitulation.</NOTE>. The lords ju&s;tices had arrived from Dublin on the fir&s;t of
<PB N="622" REF="655">
October. They ligned the articles, together with Ginckle; and thus the Iri&s;h Papi&s;ts put a happy period to a war which threatened their party with ab&s;olute ruin.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ob&s;ervations on the</NOTE> Though the terms granted at the capitulation of Lime|rick were, perhaps, nece&s;&s;ary in them&s;elves, and highly &s;uitable to humanity, they were, &s;oon after, equally di&s;|liked by both parties. The Engli&s;h Prote&s;tants looked with unbounded re&s;entment upon articles, which rendered, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, independent a &s;ect, whom, on account of ancient prejudices and recent injuries, they abhorred. The Iri&s;h, having obtained with &s;o much facility &s;uch good terms, imbibed an opinion, that they might have ex|torted conditions &s;till more favourable from an exhau&s;ted enemy. The arrival of the French fleet, two days after the capitulation, with arms, &s;tores, provi&s;ions, and am|munition, confirmed them in their &s;entiments on this &s;ub|ject. But that circum&s;tance, in conjunction with many other obvious rea&s;ons, ju&s;tified William for putting an end to the war, upon moderate terms. Many millions had already been expended in the reduction of Ireland. Near one hundred thou&s;and men had been lo&s;t by &s;ickne&s;s and the &s;word. The army, though victorious in the field, were exhau&s;ted with fatigue. Winter was approaching. The &s;iege of Limerick mu&s;t, in all probability, have been rai&s;ed. A &s;econd di&s;appointment before that place would have been equal to a defeat. The &s;pirits of the Iri&s;h would ri&s;e. The French, encouraged by their &s;ucce&s;s, would aid their allies with more effect.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iri&s;h.</NOTE> The pacification with the Iri&s;h furni&s;hed matter for much di&s;pute. The peculiar &s;ituation of that nation &s;eems to have been overlooked in the conte&s;t. The de&s;ertion, upon which the deprivation of James had been founded in England, had not exi&s;ted in Ireland. The lord-lieute|nant had retained his allegiance. The government was uniformly continued under the name of the Prince from whom the &s;ervants of the crown had derived their com|mi&s;&s;ions. James him&s;elf had, for more than &s;eventeen months, exerci&s;ed the royal function in Ireland. He was certainly <HI>de facto,</HI> if not <HI>de jure,</HI> King. The rebellion of the Iri&s;h mu&s;t therefore be founded on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that their allegiance is transferable by the parliament of England. A &s;peculative opinion can &s;carce ju&s;tify the puni&s;hment of a great majority of a people. The Iri&s;h ought to have been con&s;idered as enemies, rather than
<PB N="623" REF="656">
rebels. If, therefore, the pacification was expedient, it was certainly ju&s;t.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">pacification.</NOTE> But the opponents of William give him no credit, either for his ju&s;tice or his humanity, upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. They a&s;cribe his eagerne&s;s to fini&s;h the troubles of Ireland, to his earne&s;t de&s;ire of pro&s;ecuting with more vigour the war on the continent. They allege, that had not an Engli&s;h parliament deprived his creatures of the hopes of Iri&s;h forfeitures, he would have been le&s;s liberal in the conce&s;&s;ions which he made. Though there may have been more malice than truth in the&s;e allegations, &s;ome of the terms were neither &s;uitable to his dignity, nor con&s;i&s;tent with his u&s;ual prudence.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">William meets his parliament.</NOTE> William, having left the army on the twelfth of Augu&s;t, &s;pent near two months in hunting in the neighbourhood of Loo.

On the twenty-&s;econd of the month, the parliament met at We&s;tmin&s;ter. The King told them in his &s;peech, that he had appointed their meeting, to con&s;ider of the be&s;t and mo&s;t effectual means of pro&s;ecuting the war again&s;t France in the next campaign. He hoped, he &s;aid, that the late &s;ucce&s;s in Ireland would encourage them to &s;trengthen his hands. He doubted not but they would take care to pay the ar|rears of the army in Ireland; and he promi&s;ed, that no attention on his part &s;hould be &s;pared to keep that king|dom from being burden&s;ome to England for the future. He mentioned the expediency of &s;ending a &s;trong fleet to

The fir&s;t were irri|tated at their want of influence with a Prince who had a&s;cended, upon their principles, the throne.

The King, however, ought not to be alto|gether blamed for a conduct which &s;eemed impolitic.

In examining into the abu&s;es of civil offices, they came to a re&s;olution agreeable to the people, but di&s;tre&s;sful to government.

The way to Inverary lay acro&s;s almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able mountains. The &s;ea&s;on was extremely rigorous, and the whole country covered with a deep &s;now.

But macdonald prevailed over his &s;cruples with importunities, and even with tears<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Inquiry into the Ma&s;&s;acre at Genco. State Tracts, vol. iii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ma&s;&s;acre</NOTE> Sir John Dalrymple, afterwards Earl of Stair, a man of profligate principles, attended King William, as &s;ecretary of &s;tate for Scotland. He took advantage of Macdonald's neglecting to take the oaths within the time pre&s;cribed. He procured from the King a warrant of military execution again&s;t him and his whole tribe. As a mark of his own eagerne&s;s, or to &s;ave Dalrymple, William &s;igned the warrant, both above and below, with his own hand. The &s;ecretary, in let|ters expre&s;&s;ive of a brutal ferocity of mind, urged the military officers who commanded in the Highlands to execute their orders with the utmo&s;t rigour. Campbell of Glenlyon, a captain in the Earl of Argyle's regi|ment, and two &s;ubalterns, were ordered, with one hun|dred and twenty men, to repair to Glenco on the fir&s;t of February. Campbell, being uncle to young Macdonald's wife, was received by the father with friend&s;hip and ho&s;|pitality. The men were treated in the hou&s;es of his tenants with free quarters and kind entertainment. Till the thirteenth of February, the troops lived in good-humour and familiarity with the people. The officers, on the very night of the ma&s;&s;acre, pa&s;&s;ed the evenign and played at cards in Macdonald's hou&s;e. In the night, Lieutenant Lind&s;ay, with a party of &s;oldiers, called in a friendly manner at his door. He was in|&s;tantly admitted. Macdonald, as he was ri&s;ing from his bed to receive his gue&s;t, was &s;hot dead behind his back

with two bullets. His wife had already put on her clothes; but &s;he was &s;tript naked by the &s;oldiers, who tore the rings off her fingers with their teeth<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">State Tracts, vol. iii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">of Glenco.</NOTE> The &s;laughter now became general. To prevent the pity of the &s;oldiers to their ho&s;ts, their quarters had been changed the night before. Neither age nor infir|mity was &s;pared. Some women, in defending their children, were killed. Boys, imploring mercy, were &s;hot by officers, on who&s;e knees they hung. In one place, nine per&s;ons, as they &s;at enjoying them&s;elves at table, were &s;hot dead by the &s;oldiers. The a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins are even &s;aid to have made a &s;port of death. At Inveriggen, in Campbell's own quarters, nine men were fir&s;t bound by the &s;oldiers, then &s;hot at intervals, one by one. Se|veral, who fled to the mountains, peri&s;hed by famine and the inclemency of the &s;ea&s;on. Tho&s;e who e&s;caped owed their lives to a tempe&s;tuous night. Lieutenant-colonel Hamilton, who had the charge of the execution from Dalrymple, was on his march with four hundred men, to occupy all the pa&s;&s;es which led from the valley of Glenco. He was obliged to &s;top by the &s;everity of the weather, which proved the &s;afety of the unfortunate tribe. He entered the valley the next day. He laid all the hou&s;es in a&s;hes, and carried away all the cattle and &s;poil, which were divided among the officers and &s;ol|diers<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ob&s;erva|tions.</NOTE> All Europe, as well as Britain, was &s;hocked at the particulars of a ma&s;&s;acre, at once barbarous, impolitic, and inhuman. The rigour of the warrant, the circum|&s;tances of its execution, the ma&s;k of friend&s;hip under which an un&s;u&s;pecting and unarmed people were butcher|ed by &s;oldiers, could &s;carce be exaggerated by the ene|mies of William, or defended by his friends. The blame was laid by the latter on the mini&s;ter. They af|firmed, that the King, ever &s;low in tran&s;acting bu&s;i|ne&s;s<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. iii.</NOTE>, had &s;igned the warrant, among other papers, without inquiry. Some, with a mixture of ab&s;urdity and inju&s;tice, defended the mea&s;ure it&s;elf as con&s;i&s;tent with the laws of Scotland. Others averred, that the officers extended their rigour beyond the letter of their orders. Though the opponents of William owned,
<PB N="630" REF="665">
that he was in&s;tigated to the mea&s;ure by Dalrymple, they would not allow that he could be ignorant of the contents of a paper, which, apparently to &s;creen his &s;ecretary, he had &s;igned both above and below. War|rants of fire and &s;word, they acknowledged, had been often granted in Scotland; but they were &s;eldom exe|cuted with any degree of rigour, and never again&s;t men who were not at the time actually in arms. If the troops exceeded their orders, a point by no means clear, the King, they &s;aid, in approving afterwards of their con|duct, made their cau&s;e his own. He would not permit the actors in this tragedy to be puni&s;hed.
