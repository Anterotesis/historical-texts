<P>YOU are ab&s;olutely too ef|feminately &s;crupulous, CARLISLE&mdash;what I propo&s;ed was well meant. However, as your virtue is of a mo&s;t ob&s;tinate, anchoretical nature, which neither love nor friend&s;hip can make a voluptuous

<HEAD>LETTER LIV. From the Same to Sir ANDREW FLIGHT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear ANDREW,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE &s;tratagem takes: I have written the letter we projected, and it an&s;wers our expectation. He could not bear the idea&mdash;he was hurt&mdash;he could not believe his eyes&mdash;he would not do her &s;uch a violence for the world&mdash; But you knew his virtue. I judge it is owing in a great degree to my caution in directing to you in a <HI>counterfeit</HI> hand, that has kept our corre&s;pondence &s;o long as private as we wi&s;hed it; for, had I written in my u&s;ual character, a &s;ingle letter would have betrayed me
<PB N="4" REF="5">to CARLISLE, with whom I have lived on terms of ab&s;olute intimacy for ten years, without his ever &s;u&s;pecting me to be a <HI>jolly</HI> fellow. So ea&s;y is it for men of &s;pirit, to impo&s;e upon the&s;e mighty good kind of men. Never, &s;urely, was any thing half &s;o a-propos, as his putting the Marchione&s;s under my care&mdash;or rather my &s;i&s;ter's, who really thinks me as great a &s;aint as CARLISLE him&s;elf. But to come to the point, it may certainly be contrived for you to take unto your bo&s;om this Italian trea|&s;ure&mdash;CARLISLE refu&s;es her, that's one plea&mdash;you are a fine fellow, that's ano|ther&mdash;you have money, that's greater than even the former: her pa&s;&s;ions are awake, that's number 4 in your fa|vour: &s;he is married, and therefore above the folly of &s;ollicitation&mdash;num|ber 5&mdash;her con&s;titution glows like the torrid zone&mdash;number 6&mdash;She abhors
<PB N="5" REF="6">the Marquis&mdash;count <HI>nine</HI> for that. In &s;hort, &s;he will, &s;he mu&s;t, &s;he <HI>&s;hall</HI> be your's&mdash;As to the arrival of the Mar|quis, do not apprehend any danger from that quarter: I have counteracted the contents of the letter from CAR|LISLE, you may depend on it. It is, by your LASCELLES, &s;o ordered, that, if he goes at all in &s;earch of his <HI>Perdita,</HI> he will not direct his cour&s;e to England, but to a very different quarter of the globe. I will prepare every other grand e&s;&s;ential, even till your bed is dre&s;&s;ed with ro&s;es. In the mean time keep HEATHCOATE ignorant of the bu|&s;ine&s;s, and continue to u&s;e, or rather to amu&s;e <HI>him,</HI> with the <HI>ridiculous</HI> that re|&s;ults from your play upon the HODSONS, DREWSONS, HEWSONS&mdash;what the plague is their vulgar name? He is a worthy fellow, but not fit for <HI>&s;uch</HI> a plot as the
<PB N="6" REF="7">pre&s;ent&mdash;therefore till the deed be done, keep him out of it.</P>
<P>As to the Lady's beauty, depend on your old caterer for that. I have a hawk's eye at a pretty wench. To &s;ay the truth, the Marchione&s;s is more to your ta&s;te than any I have had the ho|nour and friend&s;hip to recommend. Her eyes have ju&s;t that fluid floating in them, and are exactly of that brilliant black you like: her no&s;e is turned to the perfection of <HI>your</HI> beauty&mdash;a little on the aquiline, and &s;et off by a pair of brows &s;o markingly expre&s;&s;ive of plea|&s;ure, that you may depend upon them. Then her lips is fir&s;t of that &s;uperior order, without corpulence, and &s;o full of maje&s;ty, without haughtine&s;s, that mo&s;t attaches you. Her bo&s;om is finely filled, and ri&s;es, as the poet emphatically
<PB REF="8">terms it, "&s;uing to be pre&s;&s;ed." Her arms, hands, fingers, are, likewi&s;e, all &s;uited to you. But enough. She is to be the &s;ubject of a much clo&s;er criti|ci&s;m than it is even po&s;&s;ible for me to give.</P>
<P>Once more, however, let me charge you, by an old and &s;erviceable friend|&s;hip, never to breathe the name of LASCELLES in any way not con&s;i&s;tent with every thing &s;acred. You know my lo&s;s of a damned fortune at one &s;troke of the die, fir&s;t reduced me to this. As it was impo&s;&s;ible to hold <HI>&s;till the elbow,</HI> &s;omething was nece&s;&s;ary to repair my mi&s;chance, and, literally &s;peaking, keep me <HI>in play:</HI> be&s;ides which, I was to live as I had ever been u&s;ed to do; I was to be the &s;ame cha|racter. Two paths pre&s;ented them|&s;elves,
<PB N="8" REF="9">the one led to the gallows by the way of pur&s;e-gathering, the other to the accommodation of a friend, by the way of <HI>woman.</HI> I &s;aw <HI>you,</HI> loved you, valued your <HI>health,</HI> and cho&s;e the latter path. You know how I have &s;uc|ceeded: let the ample catalogue of your pa&s;&s;ions, gratified in every form, con|vince you of it. You <HI>only</HI> I &s;erved: you only know me to be not ab&s;olutely&mdash; a CARLISLE. I once more repeat to you the nece&s;&s;ity of burning every letter, and every &s;lip of paper you get from me, the moment it comes to hand: if a &s;yllable at any time tran&s;pires, I am de&s;troyed for ever: the con&s;equence of which irreparable injury is, that I mu&s;t cut your throat. But keep our coun&s;el and you &s;hall be the very Jupiter of a &s;eraglio.</P>

<P>THOUGH BLESSINGBOURNE has not yet honoured my la&s;t draughts, and I have but ju&s;t an hundred pieces about me, I, neverthele&s;s, divide chear|fully with you&mdash;My pur&s;e is your's&mdash; How can&s;t talk &s;o childi&s;hly about di&s;|clo&s;ure of &s;ecrets?

I adore woman to <HI>plea&s;e</HI> me, and men to <HI>laugh</HI> at. <HI>You</HI> very liberally &s;upply
<PB N="11" REF="12">me with the one kind of gratification, HEATHCOATE with the other. Neither jars with the other's province, and I have money enough to &s;upport you both. As to character, I like it as well as you, and except laughing at men, and lying with women, I &s;olemnly declare I would not do a wrong thing for the world. But every man to his pa&s;|&s;ions&mdash;tho&s;e are mine. You rejoice my heart with repeating to me in every letter the per&s;onal charms of CARLISLE's fair follower. 'Tis a confounded thing though, to con&s;ider &s;he is &s;o taken with CARLISLE; and yet to do him ju&s;tice, he is an elegant, glorious fellow. Every day marks the goodne&s;s of his heart, and you would be an ingrateful dog to &s;ay a &s;yllable again&s;t him. If you can <HI>prevent all ri&s;que</HI> (for though you fight for me, I hate quarrels) I will be &s;ati&s;|fied with your &s;ucce&s;s by the middle of
<PB N="12" REF="13">next month. In the mean time I have a game of my own to play. Ju&s;t &s;uch a one as I can manage without a&s;&s;i&s;tance.

But, HEATHCOATE is my corre&s;pondent in this adventure; it is not of <HI>importance</HI> enough for the ambitious GEORGE LASCELLES, whom even a Marchione&s;s cannot deter from his attempts: the ob|ject of my pre&s;ent humble a&s;piring is only the wife of the mo&s;t grazier-looking HAL. HEWSON. But mum, not a word more on a &s;ubject that does not belong to you. HEATHCOATE is the man for trifles and laugh. MEDWAY is, as u&s;ual, the mo&s;t &s;ullen ra&s;cal in Europe; he was going to run me through the body the other day for to&s;&s;ing down a tumbler of fair water, which (though I &s;wear it was an accident) he in&s;i&s;ted was done with an ill-natured de&s;ign to &s;pot

<P>Another &s;trange circum&s;tance has happened in this family. Two days after I had returned &s;uch a reply to Mr. DE GREY's letter as appeared to me proper and con&s;i&s;tent, he put into my hands a letter from BLESSINGBOURNE, who had made formal overtures of marriage betwixt Mi&s;s DE GREY and Sir ANDREW FLIGHT.

<PB N="17" REF="18">excited more real a&s;toni&s;hment, for I had never once dreamt of a treaty coming from that quarter, knowing, &s;o per|fectly as I do, LUCIA's <HI>opinion</HI> of Sir ANDREW. The epi&s;tle was penned with all the title-&s;welled vanity connected with the BLESSINGBOURNE character; and coronets, cre&s;ts, and &s;upporters, lions rampant, &s;pread eagles, and fields azure, danced through every line. Having commented upon the &s;tyle, with a good humour, which is above turning the re|&s;ult of a man's infirmity into a cau&s;e of affront, Mr. DE GREY a&s;ked me my opinion of the match&mdash;</P>

<P>THE importance of the con|&s;ideration to both the young parties concerned, and the regard that is due to the natural inclinations, as to the acquired affections, are the apologies I have to offer for <HI>appearing</HI> to neglect a &s;uitable return of acknowledgment for the honour of your Lord&s;hip's letter, and for the ample propo&s;als it contained.</P>
<P><HI>Prior</HI> to the receipt of your Lord|&s;hip's favour, I made &s;ome attempt to

Not, my Lord, that it is po&s;&s;ible for me to prefer any gentleman to the nephew of the Earl of BLESSINGBOURNE, but be|cau&s;e I &s;u&s;pected an affection &s;ub&s;i&s;ting el&s;ewhere: I think, my Lord, I have di&s;covered a pa&s;&s;ion in my daughter, and a <HI>return</HI> of it in a certain young friend of mine, that may, po&s;&s;ibly, grow, in a little time, into a circum&s;tance of e&s;&s;ential con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Within a few days I &s;hall be more a&s;&s;ured of this, and if my child proves to have a heart not pre-engaged, there can be no doubt of her &s;oon becoming &s;en&s;ible of the great honour of an al|liance with &s;o near a branch of the BLESSINGBOURNE family. On the con|trary, if it &s;hould turn out that her af|fections
<PB N="28" REF="29">are already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, it will appear obvious to your Lord&s;hip, that, as, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, &s;he cannot reward the tenderne&s;s of Sir ANDREW, &s;he can have no ju&s;t title to the many dignities, and the immen&s;e fortunes which would follow &s;uch a union.</P>
<P>What I would invite then from your Lord&s;hip, is, a &s;hort <HI>&s;u&s;pen&s;ion,</HI> that the matter may lie open. I again re|peat, that a few days will naturally determine every thing. In the mean time, Sir ANDREW had better, I con|ceive, remain unacquainted with our treaty, left it &s;hould any way terminate to his di&s;&s;atisfaction. On <HI>my</HI> part, I will ha&s;ten the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;covery as much as in my power, although your Lord|&s;hip will ea&s;ily imagine, a father's power, in a point of &s;o much importance, is not very exten&s;ive, when the father
<PB N="29" REF="30">is convinced of his child's integrity and di&s;cretion.</P>

Our vi&s;it to Prudence Place was, principally, (out of an old friend|&s;hip, and becau&s;e we thought your daughter a very decent, prudent per|&s;on) to <HI>promote a match</HI> between her and our nephew. We offered the mo&s;t peculiar &s;plendours, we offered lineal
<PB N="31" REF="32">honours&mdash;but we are de&s;ired to wait the i&s;&s;ue of <HI>another treaty.</HI> And pray, Sir, may we a&s;k, which or who it is among&s;t your friends that ought to have the fir&s;t offer in preference to the nephew and heir of the Earl of BLES|SINGBOURNE? I &s;hall not mention the clear annual rent-roll of near fifty thou&s;and guineas a year, that will de|volve to him, nor will I re&s;t my con&s;e|quence upon the &s;uperbe&s;t equipage; nor on the mo&s;t magnificent &s;eats in Europe; I confine my&s;elf to that illu&s;trious line, into which the arms of your young Lady would be, if I may &s;o &s;ay,&mdash;<HI>encoated.</HI> Every body can tell, Mr. DE GREY, I am not a boa&s;ter; but, indeed, your tardy conduct borders &s;omewhat upon incivility and di&s;re&s;pect. The Counte&s;s thinks &s;o too. Neverthe|le&s;s, we &s;till think your LUCIA would adorn a coronet; &s;he is her favourite.
<PB N="32" REF="33">A little intercour&s;e with my Lady, after marriage, would make her&mdash;would&mdash; properly &s;peaking&mdash;<HI>prepare</HI> her for her new honours. Once more therefore we offer our &s;ervices to you again, and upon the full a&s;&s;urance of your imme|diate con&s;ent, the Counte&s;s and I are proceeding to mea&s;ures that may bring the point to a cri&s;is.</P>

<PB N="54" REF="55">a woman over a cartret, and as to laughing where one don't &s;ee the joke, and where the thing is one almo&s;t nothing at all, I never could do it &s;ince I was born.

<PB N="84" REF="85">MEDWAY, the mon&s;ter, had ju&s;t with|drawn with his angle. He was &s;tanding with his eyes fixed intently upon the line, greedily devouring the dancing cork upon the &s;tream, when I pa&s;&s;ed by on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, as not &s;eeing him. The Earl's letter was in my hand&mdash;I appeared to be tickled to the &s;oul. I affected to hold my &s;ides with the pain of laughing. I mentioned the name of <HI>Lady</HI> LUCIA thrice with rapture. My hero threw down his fi&s;hing-rod, and coming round to me with inconceivable violence, and the mo&s;t &s;carlet vi&s;age you ever beheld, even more <HI>a flame</HI> than a &s;etting &s;un, he cries out&mdash;Puppy, jackanapes &mdash; what did you frighten away my fi&s;h for? the large&s;t carp that ever was &s;een nibbled that moment at my bait.

Are there then more heavens than one heaven? &mdash; more LUCIA DE GREY's than one LUCIA DE GREY? &s;aid I, with great intrepidity, taking &s;nuff.</P>

<P>Nay, I am all upon honourable terms. There are no &s;ecrets&mdash;'Tis to be a public affair, OLLY. There is the letter for thy in&s;pection.</P>

<P>So then you are a fellow who make preten&s;ions to Mi&s;s DE GREY, are you?</P>
<P>I did, by no means, like a certain ill-look about his eyes, and therefore replied mildly&mdash;As to that, my dear OLLY, you may ea&s;ily &s;ee it was all my uncle's doing&mdash;My uncle, you &s;ee&mdash;</P>
<P>Your uncle be damned, replied he. Have you written to the Lady your|&s;elf?</P>

<P>PITY me, my dear LAS|CELLES, pity me! Never&mdash;no, never was man &s;o be&s;et by temptations! MEDWAY drew me, a little while &s;ince, in his fly way, to the very farthermo&s;t end of the room, and in the &s;ofte&s;t whi&s;per told me, that&mdash;O mi&s;ery, Mr. LASCELLES!&mdash;he &s;hould have the ring upon LUCIA's finger in le&s;s than three days. "Hu&s;h&mdash;hu&s;h&mdash;&s;aid he, 'tis the greate&s;t in the world&mdash;the poor girl is quite &s;ick upon my delay&mdash;She chides me with her looks, every time I &s;ee her.

<P>Had not water been at hand, I &s;hould certainly have dropt.</P>
<P>To &s;well the circum&s;tance, both the HEWSONS and Sir ANDREW FLIGHT were in the room.</P>
<P>This was not all. Mr. DE GREY &s;eemed to receive the packet with plea|&s;ure, and retired rather abrupter than he was wont to do, when he leaves a com|pany.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="141">
MEDWAY hummed a love &s;onnet, and capered about the room; pa&s;&s;ing by me every now and then with a wink.</P>
<P>The trial was too hard to be &s;up|ported. I withdrew. What was to be done? It was plain that Sir ANDREW's affair was out of the que&s;tion; <HI>Med|way&mdash;Medway only,</HI> was the man. For <HI>Medway</HI>&mdash;the cruel&mdash;(ah! why do I call her cruel?)&mdash;the <HI>charming</HI> LUCIA DE GREY was now langui&s;hing in her chamber: for <HI>him,</HI> &s;he had been long indi&s;po&s;ed&mdash;<HI>his</HI> image it was that filled her thoughts&mdash;<HI>his</HI> per&s;on it was that charmed her eyes&mdash;<HI>he</HI> only was&mdash;to&mdash; to&mdash;</P>

LUCIA DE GREY her&s;elf appeared. She came tottering from her apartment, with a countenance, which, although ever lovely, denoted infinite emotion.</P>

You &s;hall hear.</P>
<P>Unable, any longer, to bear the in|crea&s;ing perplexities of my &s;ituation, I wrote a letter of excu&s;e to Mr. DE GREY for a week's ab&s;ence, and went to pay my farewell re&s;pects to LUCIA.</P>
<P>Sugge&s;ting what might be the &s;tate of my feelings at the clo&s;e of &s;uch an interview, I took care to have my car|riage waiting for me at the door the moment I left her apartment&mdash;nor did I even <HI>allow</HI> my&s;elf this plea&s;ure of entering her apartment at all, till I had pre-invited <HI>Mr. De Grey</HI> to be pre&s;ent, and even till I had <HI>apprized Mr. Med|way</HI> of the &s;ole purpo&s;e of my vi&s;it.</P>
<P>I meant only to make&mdash;my <HI>heart ach</HI>&mdash;and withdraw.&mdash;Oh human na|ture!&mdash;</P>

Mr. DE GREY opened the door to me; he had &s;carce entered him&s;elf&mdash; Behind him &s;tood&mdash;MEDWAY, making his &s;alutations to LUCIA, who, upon &s;eeing me advance, put on, as of late had been u&s;ual, a &s;ort of <HI>anxiou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> which I have been but too apt to con|&s;true in my <HI>disfavour.</HI></P>
<P>LUCIA DE GREY looked, as if &s;he thought it a <HI>&s;trange meeting.</HI></P>
<P>"Pray &s;it down, gentlemen," &s;aid &s;he, in a fluttering manner&mdash;"Pray &s;it down."</P>
<P>Her father took her by the hand. I was preparing to &s;peak on the &s;ubject of my departure&mdash;but could, for the &s;oul of me, get no farther than&mdash;"I am come, Madam&mdash;I am come, Mi&s;s DE GREY&mdash;I am&mdash;I am come"&mdash;</P>

<P>Oh! LASCELLES, my perverting fancy caught at the only wrong con|&s;truction of the &s;entiment, and I inter|rupted him by exclaiming,</P>
<P>"Excu&s;e me, my dear Mr. DE GREY&mdash;pray excu&s;e me&mdash;I would de|dicate not only my lei&s;ure, but my life to the wi&s;hes of your family&mdash;but to be a <HI>witne&s;s</HI>&mdash;to be a <HI>witne&s;s,</HI> my good Sir, upon &s;o intere&s;ting an occa&s;ion&mdash; is&mdash;is&mdash;is&mdash;indeed, I could not be of any &s;ervice."</P>

<P>"<HI>Yes,</HI> Madam, <HI>I,</HI>"&mdash;&s;aid MEDWAY?</P>

<P>Here LUCIA lifted up her hands again.</P>
<P>"I grant all this, my dear MEDWAY," &s;aid Mr. DE GREY, "but &s;urely, this is no foundation for a pa&s;&s;ion. LUCIA &s;miles whenever &s;he meets any of her friends.

<P>"Lookee, Mr. DE GREY," replied MEDWAY&mdash;"hu&s;h &mdash; hu&s;h &mdash; no noi&s;e about this bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;I am no talker. I have been intending to make your

"Give me your hand," cried MED|WAY; "you &s;peak fairly&mdash;I love honour better than life&mdash;life&mdash;it <HI>is</HI> MY heaven&mdash; Well, Mi&s;s LUCIA, now is the time. Every thing re&s;ts with you?"</P>
<P>Gue&s;s, if you can, LASCELLES, what I underwent at this moment! My heart was at my lips.</P>
<P>"Since it is incumbent on me to &s;peak," &s;aid the beautiful trembler, "I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that, though there is no man I more e&s;teem than Mr. MEDWAY, as a <HI>friend;</HI> yet, yet, in the light of&mdash; of&mdash;a <HI>lover,</HI> I&mdash;I&mdash;cannot &s;ay that&mdash; that&mdash;Pray be not di&s;plea&s;ed with me, if I &s;ay that&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Enough &s;aid, enough &s;aid&mdash;hu&s;h&mdash; hu&s;h&mdash;I'm only angry," &s;aid MEDWAY,

<P>"Another moment, if you plea&s;e," &s;aid Mr. DE GREY, (ri&s;ing and ad|vancing to LUCIA, whom in the cour&s;e of the conver&s;ation he had left)&mdash;"Since matters have gone thus far, and we are all friends together; tell me, LUCIA,

<P>My God, LASCELLES, what a que&s;tion!</P>
<P>"No, indeed, Sir," an&s;wered LUCIA, with a &s;igh.</P>
<P>"Oh! yes," rejoined MEDWAY, "that bit of a Baronet, Sir ANDREW FLIGHT."</P>

"Madam," returned MEDWAY, "I was about to have jerked him into a fi&s;h pond upon that account. If you have ever any thing to &s;ay to &s;uch a fellow as that, I'll never forgive you."</P>
<P>"Perhaps it may be in <HI>your</HI> power, Mr. CARLISLE," &s;aid Mr. DE GREY, (coming round to me) "to help us to another upon the lover's li&s;t."</P>
<P>Think of my confu&s;ion, LASCELLES! after great he&s;itation I &s;poke as follows, while LUCIA went fir&s;t to one window then to the other, as if taking different views of the garden.</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t own, Sir, it does not &s;eem difficult for me to mention another of Mi&s;s DE GREY's admirers. The dif|ficulty would be in finding a per&s;on of

<PB N="194" REF="195">which any woman might have taken for real, to his lips. He even talked, with blooming cheeks, upon the day of marriage: he pretended that he &s;uffered unutterable things by delay. He &s;aid, he &s;hould never be happy till I was his. He ab&s;olutely carried the cruel joke &s;o far as to a&s;&s;ert, he had commi&s;&s;ioned your brother to purcha&s;e decorations for the joyful day!</P>
<P>This &s;eemed a proper opportunity to draw up the curtain, and di&s;cover the fir&s;t &s;cene of his farce. Oh what a dialogue!</P>
<P>"I think, Mr. CARLISLE, you wrote &s;ome letters to my father from the hou&s;e of a Marquis of N. during your re&s;idence at Rome?"</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="196">
"I did, Madam&mdash;I did, my dear LUCIA."</P>
<P>"You &s;poke, I think, occa&s;ionally, of the Marchione&s;s his Lady?"</P>
<P>"I did. She is a charming woman. Except LUCIA DE GREY, I never &s;aw a lovelier."</P>
<P>"'P&s;haw, your exception is a flat|tery. Is &s;he &s;en&s;ible?"</P>
<P>"She is, beyond imagination."</P>
<P>"You were upon very good terms, no doubt?"</P>

<P>"Rather <HI>accompli&s;hed</HI> than learned: &s;he wants, however, that gentlene&s;s which di&s;tingui&s;hes the lovely LUCIA DE GREY."</P>
<P>"You left her, certainly, with regret?"</P>
<P>"Had it not been for LUCIA DE GREY, whom I fondly expected to &s;ee, it might have been &s;o."</P>

"No, &s;he was ill at that time with a cold, and did not go with the Marquis."</P>

<P>"Like a woman of &s;pirit, that is all. I dare &s;ay now, CLEMENT, if you would but confe&s;s, this <HI>has</HI> been the ca&s;e."</P>

<P>"'Tis from a quite new corre&s;pon|dent; and, by-the-by, there is a &s;mall inclo&s;ure for you. Here are both."</P>
<P>I gave him, Mi&s;s LASCELLES, the Marquis's letter.</P>
<P>"It is very true, Mi&s;s DE GREY," &s;aid he, without any emotion, after reading them, "that the Marchione&s;s is at pre&s;ent under my protection; and

<P>"Is it? then the Marquis is not angry without cau&s;e?"</P>
<P>"It is a painful circum&s;tance to re|late, my dear LUCIA, though there is no guilt on either &s;ide. You will ex|cu&s;e me on the &s;ubject.

<P>NEVER &s;urely, Mi&s;s LAS|CELLES, was any &s;cene &s;o complicated with horrors and &s;urpri&s;es, as that to which I have ju&s;t been a witne&s;s. I write now in the deepe&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, and write now in the deepe&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, and in a hou&s;e of general mourning. In the fir&s;t place, Mi&s;s LASCELLES, your brother is no more&mdash;the fair but un|happy occa&s;ion of his death is al&s;o near her end, and the hu&s;band is almo&s;t di&s;tracted. Ah, my CAROLINE, how I tremble!</P>
<P>But it is nece&s;&s;ary for me, however painful, to proceed to the minute&s;t of this horrid bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="231">
I traced Mr. CARLISLE, unob&s;erved, till he came within view of the &s;pot. I heard &s;omebody advance from behind a tree. It was the Marquis of N ***. It was too late to di&s;cover my&s;elf, or to hope any thing from entreaties. They joined, and walked together. I went tremblingly behind. CARLISLE told the whole hi&s;tory of the unfortu|nate AUGUSTA. He attributed the whole to frolic: he prote&s;ted that &s;he was &s;till under the mo&s;t &s;acred pro|tection at the hou&s;e of Mr. LASCELLES in London. He pleaded a thou&s;and apologies &mdash; Pledged him&s;elf for her fidelity. The Marquis would &s;carce &s;uffer him to fini&s;h a &s;ingle &s;entence without interruption: he is the mo&s;t head&s;trong man in the world; he exe|crated CARLISLE as a <HI>&s;educer;</HI> he even reprobated him as a <HI>coward.</HI> He in|fi&s;ted upon taking his life, if it was not
<PB N="231" REF="232">immediately defended. He &s;trode on|ward to mea&s;ure the ground.</P>
<P>"A little farther <HI>on</HI> then, Sir," &s;aid he to the Marquis, "this is not a pro|per place for our, in my opinion, very unnece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s. &mdash; Behind yonder hou&s;e is a heath, the cla&s;h of our weapons will not there be heard."</P>
<P>I was ready to expire, my deare&s;t Mi&s;s LASCELLES, at every &s;tep, and with very great difficulty e&s;caped ob|&s;ervation.</P>
<P>"If it <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be &s;o, Sir," continued CARLISLE, "this is the &s;pot."</P>
<P>At this moment, Mi&s;s LASCELLES, we heard a confu&s;ed murmur of voices. The &s;ounds came from the other &s;ide of a &s;mall plantation of firs.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="233">
"Stop, Sir," cried the Marquis&mdash; "no witne&s;&s;es&mdash;all fair play, if you plea&s;e; I do not mean to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate <HI>you, Carli&s;le;</HI> nor &s;hall you a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate me."</P>
<P>They both went on the other &s;ide of the plantation&mdash;The moon &s;hot forth her ray at the very in&s;tant of entering; and as if Providence de&s;igned it &s;o, her beams were beyond compari&s;on bright&mdash; Oh earth and heaven, what a &s;cene was opened upon us from removing this curtain of darkne&s;s!</P>
<P>In one part we beheld the per&s;ons of Mr. MEDWAY and Mr. LASCELLES, as it proved to be, &s;tanding upon the de|fen&s;ive. In another &s;tood the figure of a <HI>&s;tripling</HI> leaning pen&s;ively again&s;t a fir, as if he were unengaged in the combat, yet cho&s;e to be a &s;pectator. At a &s;mall
<PB N="233" REF="234">di&s;tance (yet not &s;ufficiently near to be di&s;tingui&s;hed for the per&s;ons they <HI>really</HI> were) clu&s;tered another groupe, as if they wi&s;hed rather to &s;ee, than to be &s;een.</P>
<P>"Confu&s;ion," &s;aid MEDWAY, "we are di&s;covered. If I knew by <HI>whom,</HI> I would annihilate him&mdash;Ha!" continued he, looking in the face of his antago|ni&s;t, "by Heaven, this is not Sir ANDREW FLIGHT."</P>
<P>"I am his <HI>friend,</HI> Sir," &s;aid the other, "and I choo&s;e to fight for him&mdash; Cur&s;e on the moon-beams!"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Good God," cried CARLISLE, by this time come near enough to recog|nize him: "Is it my friend LASCELLES, whom I behold?"</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="235">
"<HI>Carli&s;le!</HI>" exclaimed Mr. LAS|CELLES&mdash;"Is it you?"</P>
<P>"Come, Sir," &s;aid the Marquis eagerly, "no trifling &mdash; my time is precious."</P>
<P>CARLISLE drew his &s;word.</P>
<P>"Oh, oh; hu&s;h &mdash; hu&s;h" &mdash; &s;aid MEDWAY, "&s;oftly&mdash;if that's the ca&s;e&mdash; no noi&s;e: we are all come upon the &s;ame errand, I find. Advance then, every man his bird, and there's an end of it. As to Sir ANDREW, I will cha&s;ti&s;e him for <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> and in the mean time, as you think fit to repre&s;ent him, I will cha&s;ti&s;e you for meddling in the quarrels of a fool&mdash;Come on, Sir."</P>
<P>He fired his pi&s;tol in a moment: Mr. LASCELLES exchanged the &s;alu|tation&mdash;They
<PB N="235" REF="236">were preparing again&mdash; The Marquis and CARLISLE began to parry.</P>
<P>Mr. LASCELLES &s;eeing this, eagerly threw down his pi&s;tol:</P>
<P>"Stop, &s;top, for Heaven's &s;ake &s;top," &s;aid he to the Marquis&mdash;"touch not&mdash;lift not your arm again&s;t CAR|LISLE, I charge you&mdash;Here, Sir&mdash;here into this bo&s;om direct your vengeance&mdash; 'Tis I, Marquis, I have been the cau&s;e of all your misfortune."</P>
<P>There was no time for expo&s;tulation: Mr. LASCELLES caught the &s;word from the hand of CARLISLE, and in&s;i&s;ted upon <HI>fir&s;t</HI> engaging with the Marquis.</P>
<P>CARLISLE was without arms. MED|WAY ha&s;tened to arm him. The Mar|quis
<PB N="236" REF="237">ru&s;hed upon him, without regard|ing LASCELLES.</P>
<P>LASCELLES again threw him&s;elf be|fore CARLISLE, and even pu&s;hed vi|gorou&s;ly at the Marquis. He was at length provoked to begin with your brother, my dear Mi&s;s LASCELLES The very fir&s;t thru&s;t of the Marquis was fatal, for the weapon pa&s;&s;ed thro' the &s;ide of Mr. LASCELLES into his heart. The Marquis received a wound al&s;o in exchange&mdash;</P>
<P>Your brother had &s;carce fallen, be|fore the &s;tripling, whom the other ob|jects had prevented from more notice (and who had, indeed, retired farther off upon &s;eeing us) now came forward in a feeble manner, and fell upon the ground almo&s;t at the feet of the Mar|quis.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="238">
"De&s;i&s;t, de&s;i&s;t," &s;aid the poor thing, in the mo&s;t piercing tone in the world&mdash; "de&s;i&s;t from farther altercation&mdash;Here lies, at the point of all her wi&s;hes, the unhappy cau&s;e of&mdash;"</P>
<P>The &s;entence was left unfini&s;hed, for the &s;peaker of it fainted away.</P>
<P>Oh, Mi&s;s LASCELLES, it was the Marchione&s;s of N *** in di&s;gui&s;e&mdash; She had rai&s;ed her own beautiful arm again&s;t her own charming bo&s;om. The point of a &s;mall &s;word was &s;till &s;ticking there.</P>
<P>I ran to her relief.</P>
<P>The Marquis &s;tood fixed in horror, but &s;till looked &s;ullen.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="239">
MEDWAY was gone.</P>
<P>CARLISLE was agonized by the mo&s;t divided attention.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s appeared to be ex|piring&mdash;She reque&s;ted to be carried to LASCELLES, who was in the &s;ame &s;ituation&mdash;</P>
<P>It is too hard a ta&s;k for me, Mi&s;s LASCELLES, to recount to you the dreadful particulars of this pathetic &s;cene. It is incumbent upon me, how|ever, to ob&s;erve, that &s;uch circum|&s;tances appeared on the part of your brother by his own dying confe&s;&s;ion, that, as it is impo&s;&s;ible for his life to have been happy, you will the le&s;s la|ment him. <HI>You,</HI> however, my dear Mi&s;s LASCELLES, he cleared from every im|putation that might, in con&s;equence of

He received her forgivene&s;s&mdash;As for the Marchione&s;s her&s;elf&mdash;Oh, Mi&s;s LASCELLES&mdash;words can give you no idea of her &s;ituation.</P>
<P>She was tremblingly &s;en&s;ible to every thing&mdash;She looked tenderly at me, and gave my hand to CARLISLE.</P>
<P>She gave it as &s;he lay bleeding be|fore us&mdash;We conveyed her to Prudence Place. Her hu&s;band is not even yet convinced of his cruelties, yet &s;he ki&s;&s;ed his hand&mdash;She wondered not, &s;he &s;aid, at CARLISLE's preference.</P>
<P>"Superior beauty added to &s;uperior virtue," &s;aid &s;he, taking my hand, "might well conquer."</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="241">

<P>WHAT a peculiarity of di&s;|po&s;ition marks the Marquis of N***! Though his wound, which he received from your brother, is become more alarming, he in&s;i&s;ted upon being per|mitted to go into the apartment of the poor langui&s;hing AUGUSTA at a very un&s;ea&s;onable hour of the la&s;t night. CARLISLE di&s;&s;uaded him from this; but &s;oon after he again renewed the &s;ubject, and was admitted.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="249">
He &s;hut to the door, and &s;poke to his Lady in a very ungentle manner. We were going to expo&s;tulate with him upon the impropriety of this conduct, when he came out of the room, and told us, the Marchione&s;s would be well enough to depart &s;oon&mdash;He did not &s;tay for any reply to this &s;trange intelli|gence, but ran down &s;tairs into the &s;aloon, and from thence into the &s;table. He in&s;i&s;ted upon his hor&s;e, on which, under pretence of taking the air, tho' he was &s;carce able to &s;it, he rode away at full &s;peed. He di&s;turbed us, to enjoy this frolic, in the middle of the night; and he has not been heard of &s;ince. Surely there never lived &s;o &s;ingular a character.</P>
<P>Alas! the Marchione&s;s is by no means in the recovering way the Marquis re|pre&s;ented her. Though her wound was
<PB N="249" REF="250">more promi&s;ing at the la&s;t dre&s;&s;ing, her fever is rather increa&s;ed than abated. Yet &s;he has never &s;poken di&s;re&s;pectfully of this &s;trange hu&s;band &s;ince her illne&s;s. She &s;eemed much relieved, however, at the news of his being gone. "Then," &s;ays &s;he, "I &s;hall die in peace: he will not come again to abu&s;e me."</P>
<P>How pathetically, my dear Mi&s;s LAS|CELLES, am I concerned for the life of this lovely woman!&mdash;Do not believe I counterfeit: I &s;peak &s;incerely. Her conduct has a larger apology in the treatment of &s;o barbarous a hu&s;band. &mdash;Pray Heaven! &s;he may recover.</P>

<P>They de&s;ired a few minutes conver&s;a|tion with me and Mr. DE GREY, in the library. They came hand-in-hand. They opened the de&s;ign of their vi&s;it immediately.</P>

"Ma&s;ter DE GREY," &s;aid the hu&s;|band, "I am obliged to you for all favours, but I have had enough of your high life: &s;o has HETT: we have &s;een men killed, women wounded, friends fighting, hone&s;t men's wives attempted to be '<HI>bauched,</HI> and Lords taking pet without '<HI>ca&s;ion.</HI> So in a few words, HETT and I have '<HI>&s;olved</HI> to go back, and live again at Skelter.

<P>No intreaties can prevail upon the Marchione&s;s to &s;tay. She declares &s;he is well. Her fever is indeed gone, but the Doctor &s;ays, &s;he ri&s;ques a relap&s;e.
