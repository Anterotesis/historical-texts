<P>THE idea of the Character of <HI>DRUGGET,</HI> in the following piece, was taken from a paper written by Mr. <HI>POPE,</HI> and publi&s;hed in the <HI>Guardian, No.</HI> 173. The reader will perceive &s;ome &s;trictures of true humour from thence in&s;erted in this little Comedy. The vio|lent differences between <HI>Sir Charles</HI> and <HI>Lady Rackett</HI> about a trifle, and the renewal of tho&s;e differences by venturing, after they had &s;ub&s;ided, to re&s;ume the object in thorough good humour, are, it is conceived, founded in Na|ture, becau&s;e &s;imilar incidents often occur in real life. To &s;hew the pa&s;&s;ions thus frivol|ou&s;ly agitated, and to point out the ridicule &s;pringing from their various turns and &s;hift|ings, was the main drift of the en&s;uing &s;cenes. But &s;ome people were determined not to hear, and the Author could not be induced by any pri|vate motives to &s;end the Performers a &s;econd time into &s;o painful a &s;ervice as that of the Stage always is, when a few are unwilling to be entertained.</P>

<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but li&s;ten to rea&s;on. Mrs. Dimity&mdash;has not your ma&s;ter, Mr. Drugget, invited me down to his country-hou&s;e, in order to give me his daughter Nancy in marriage; and with what pre|tence can he now break off?</P>

"Upon my word, he's a pretty young gentleman."&mdash;Then wheel about to the mother: "Your daughter, Ma'am, is the very model of you, and I &s;hall adore her for your &s;ake." "Here, come hither, Nancy, take this gentleman for better for wor&s;e." "La, Mama, I can never con&s;ent."&mdash;"I &s;hould not have thought of your con&s;ent&mdash;the con&s;ent of your relations is enough: why how now, Hu&s;&s;ey!&mdash;So away you go to church, the knot is tied, and you quarrel like contrary elements all the re&s;t of your lives&mdash;that's the way of the world now."</P>

But you mu&s;t be too frank!&mdash;"Tho&s;e walks and alleys are too regular&mdash;tho&s;e evergreens &s;hould not be cut into &s;uch fanta&s;tic &s;hapes."&mdash;And thus you ad|vi&s;e a poor old mechanic, who delights in every thing that's mon&s;trous, to follow nature&mdash;Oh, you're likely to be a &s;ucce&s;s|ful lover!</P>
