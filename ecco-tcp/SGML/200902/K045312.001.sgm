<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a &s;ingular inju&s;tice which is often exerci&s;ed towards women, fir&s;t to give them a mo&s;t defective Education, and then to expect from them the mo&s;t unde|viating purity of conduct;&mdash;to train them in &s;uch a manner as &s;hall lay them open to the mo&s;t dangerous faults, and then to cen&s;ure them for not proving faultle&s;s. Is it not unrea&s;onable and unju&s;t, to ex|pre&s;s di&s;appointment if our daughters &s;hould, in their &s;ub&s;equent lives, turn out preci&s;ely that very kind of character for which it would be evident to an un|prejudiced by-&s;tander that the whole &s;cope and tenor of their in&s;truction had been &s;y&s;tematically preparing them?</P>
<P>Some reflections on the pre&s;ent erroneous &s;y&s;tem are here with great deference &s;ub|mitted to public con&s;ideration. The
<PB N="x" REF="10">Author is apprehen&s;ive that &s;he &s;hall be accu&s;ed of betraying the intere&s;ts of her &s;ex by laying open their defects: but &s;urely, an earne&s;t wi&s;h to turn their atten|tion to objects calculated to promote their true dignity, is not the office of an enemy: &s;o to expo&s;e the weakne&s;s of the land as to &s;ugge&s;t the nece&s;&s;ity of internal improvement, and to point out the means of effectual defence, is not treachery, but patrioti&s;m.</P>
<P>Again, it may be objected to this little work, that many errors are here a&s;cribed to women which by no means belong to them <HI>exclu&s;ively,</HI> and that it has &s;eemed to confine to the &s;ex tho&s;e faults which are common to the &s;pecies: but this is in &s;ome mea&s;ure unavoidable. In &s;peak|ing on the qualities of one &s;ex the morali&s;t is &s;omewhat in the &s;ituation of the Geo|grapher, who is treating on the nature of one country:&mdash;the air, &s;oil, and produce of the land which he is de&s;cribing, cannot fail in many e&s;&s;ential points to re&s;emble
<PB N="xi" REF="11">tho&s;e of other countries under the &s;ame parallel; yet it is his bu&s;ine&s;s to de&s;cant on the one without adverting to the other: and though in drawing his map he may happen to introduce &s;ome of the neigh|bouring coa&s;t, yet his principal attention mu&s;t be confined to that country he has undertaken to de&s;cribe, without taking into account the re&s;embling circum&s;tances of the adjacent &s;hores.</P>
<P>It may be objected al&s;o that the opinion here &s;ugge&s;ted on the &s;tate of manners among the higher cla&s;&s;es of our country|women, may &s;eem to controvert the ju&s;t encomiums of modern travellers, who unanimou&s;ly concur in a&s;cribing a decided &s;uperiority to the ladies of this country over tho&s;e of every other. But &s;uch is the &s;tate of manners in mo&s;t of tho&s;e countries with which the compari&s;on has been made, that the comparative prai&s;e is almo&s;t an injury to <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> women. To be flattered for excelling tho&s;e who&s;e &s;tandard of excellence is very low, is but
<PB N="xii" REF="12">a degrading kind of commendation; for the value of all prai&s;e derived from &s;uperi|ority depends on the worth of the compe|titor. The character of Briti&s;h ladies, with all the unparalled advantages they po&s;&s;e&s;s, mu&s;t never be determined by a compari&s;on with the women of other na|tions, but by what they them&s;elves might be if all their talents and unrivalled oppor|tunities were turned to the be&s;t account.</P>
<P>Again, it may be &s;aid, that the Author is le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to expatiate on excellence than error: but the office of the hi&s;torian of human manners is not panegyric, but delineation. Were the end in view eulo|gium and not improvement, eulogium would have been far more gratifying, nor would ju&s;t objects for prai&s;e have been difficult to find. Even in her own limited &s;phere of ob&s;ervation, the Author is her|&s;elf acquainted with much excellence in the cla&s;s of which &s;he treats;&mdash;with wo|men who, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing learning which would be thought exten&s;ive in the other &s;ex, &s;et
<PB N="xiii" REF="13">an example of deep humility to their own;&mdash; women who, di&s;tingui&s;hed for wit and genius, are eminent for dome&s;tic qualities;&mdash;who, excelling in the fine arts, have carefully enriched their under&s;tandings;&mdash;who, en|joying great affluence, devote it to the glory of God;&mdash;who, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing elevated rank, think their noble&s;t &s;tyle and title is that of a Chri&s;tian.&mdash;</P>
<P>That there is al&s;o much worth which is little known, &s;he is per&s;uaded; for it is the mode&s;t nature of goodne&s;s to exert it&s;elf quietly, while a few characters of the oppo&s;ite ca&s;t &s;eem, by the rumour of their exploits, to fill the world; and by their noi&s;e to multiply their numbers. For it will generally be found in almo&s;t any bu&s;tle for notice, that the minority, by occupying the fore-ground, &s;o &s;eize the public attention and monopolize the public talk, that <HI>they</HI> appear to be the great body: and a few active &s;pirits, pro|vided their activity take the wrong turn and &s;upport the wrong cau&s;e, &s;eem to fill
<PB N="xiv" REF="14">the &s;cene; and a few di&s;turbers of order, who have the talent of thus exciting a fal&s;e idea of their multitudes by their mi&s;chiefs, actually gain &s;trength and &s;well their num|bers by this fallacious arithmetic.</P>
<P>But the pre&s;ent work is no more in|tended for a panegyric on tho&s;e purer characters who, acting from higher motives, &s;eek not human prai&s;e, than for a &s;atire on the avowedly licentious, who, acting from no motives but the impul&s;e of the moment or the predominance of fa&s;hion, di&s;like not cen&s;ure, &s;o it may &s;erve to re&s;cue them from neglect or oblivion.</P>
<P>But there are multitudes of the young and the well-di&s;po&s;ed, who have as yet taken no decided part, who are ju&s;t launching on the ocean of life, ju&s;t about to lo&s;e their own right convictions, and to counteract their better propen&s;ities, unre|luctantly yielding them&s;elves to be carried down the tide of popular practices, &s;an|guine and confident of &s;afety.&mdash;To
<PB N="xv" REF="15">the&s;e the Author would gently hint, that, when once embarked, it will be no longer ea&s;y to &s;ay to their pa&s;&s;ions, or even to their principles, "Thus far &s;hall ye go, and no "further."</P>
<P>Should any reader revolt at what he conceives to be unwarranted &s;trictne&s;s in this little book, let it not be thrown by in di&s;gu&s;t before the following &s;hort con&s;ider|ation be weighed.&mdash;If in this Chri&s;tian country we are actually beginning to re|gard the &s;olemn office of Bapti&s;m as merely furni&s;hing an article to the pari&s;h regi&s;ter;&mdash;if we are learning from our in|defatigable Teachers, to con&s;ider this Chri&s;tian rite as purely a legal ceremony retained for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of recording the <HI>age</HI> of our children:&mdash;then, indeed, the prevailing Sy&s;tem of Education and Manners on which the&s;e volumes pre&s;ume to animadvert, may be adopted with pro|priety and per&s;i&s;ted in with &s;afety, with|out entailing on our children, or on our
<PB N="xvi" REF="16">our&s;elves the peril of broken promi&s;es or the guilt of violated vows.&mdash;But, if the obligation which Chri&s;tian Bapti&s;m im|po&s;es be really binding;&mdash;if the ordinance have, indeed, a meaning beyond a mere &s;ecular tran&s;action, beyond a record of names and dates;&mdash;if it be an in&s;titution by which the child is &s;olemnly devoted to God as his Father, to Je&s;us Chri&s;t as his Saviour, and to the Holy Spirit as his Sanctifier; if there be no definite period a&s;&s;igned when the obligation of fulfilling the duties it enjoins &s;hall be &s;uper&s;eded; &mdash;if, having once dedicated our offspring to their Creator, we no longer dare to mock Him by bringing them up in igno|rance of His Will and neglect of His Laws;&mdash;if, after having enli&s;ted them under the banners of Chri&s;t, to fight manfully again&s;t the three great enemies of mankind, we are no longer at liberty to let them lay down their arms; much le&s;s to lead them to act as if in alliance
<PB N="xvii" REF="17">in&s;tead of ho&s;tility with the&s;e enemies; if after having promi&s;ed that they &s;hall re|nounce the vanities of the world, we are not allowed to invalidate the engagement; &mdash;if after &s;uch a covenant we &s;hould tremble to make the&s;e renounced vanities the &s;upreme object of our own pur&s;uit or of <HI>their</HI> in&s;truction;&mdash;if all this be really &s;o, then the Strictures on Modern Educa|tion in the fir&s;t of the&s;e Volumes, and on the Habits of poli&s;hed Life in the &s;econd, will not be found &s;o repugnant to truth, and rea&s;on, and common &s;en&s;e, as may on a fir&s;t view be &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>But if on candidly &s;umming up the evidence, the de&s;ign and &s;cope of the Author be fairly judged, not by the cu&s;toms or opinions of the worldly, (for every Engli&s;h &s;ubject has a right to object to a &s;u&s;pected or prejudiced jury,) but by an appeal to that divine law which is the only infallible rule of judgment; if on &s;uch an appeal her views and principles &s;hall be found cen&s;urable for their rigour, ab&s;urd
<PB N="xviii" REF="18">in their requi&s;itions, or prepo&s;terous in their re&s;trictions, &s;he will have no right to complain of &s;uch a verdict, becau&s;e &s;he will then &s;tand condemned by that court to who&s;e deci&s;ion &s;he implicitly &s;ubmits.</P>
<P>Let it not be &s;u&s;pected that the Author arrogantly conceives her&s;elf to be exempt from that natural corruption of the heart which it is one chief object of this &s;light work to exhibit; that &s;he &s;uperciliou&s;ly erects her&s;elf into the impeccable cen&s;or of her &s;ex and of the world; as if from the critic's chair &s;he were coldly pointing out the faults and errors of another order of beings, in who&s;e welfare &s;he had not that lively intere&s;t which can only flow from the tender and intimate participation of fellow-feeling.</P>
<P>With a deep &s;elf-aba&s;ement ari&s;ing from a &s;trong conviction of being indeed a partaker in the &s;ame corrupt nature; together with a full per&s;ua&s;ion of the many and great defects of the&s;e Volumes, and a &s;incere con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her inability
<PB N="xix" REF="19">to do ju&s;tice to a &s;ubject which, however, a &s;en&s;e of duty impelled her to undertake, &s;he commits her&s;elf to the candour of that Public which has &s;o frequently, in her in&s;tance, accepted a right intention as a &s;ub&s;titute for a powerful performance.</P>

<HEAD>ON THE <HI>PREVAILING SYSTEM</HI> OF EDUCATION, MANNERS, AND HABITS OF WOMEN OF RANK AND FORTUNE.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Addre&s;s to women of rank and fortune, on the effects of their influence on &s;ociety.&mdash; Sugge&s;tions for the exertion of it in various in&s;tances.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AMONG the talents for the application of which women of the higher cla&s;s will be peculiarly accountable, there is one, the importance of which they can &s;carcely rate too highly. This talent is influence. We read of the greate&s;t orator of antiquity, that the wi&s;e&s;t plans which it had co&s;t him years to frame, a woman could overturn in a &s;ingle day; and when one con&s;iders the variety of mi&s;chiefs which an ill-directed
<PB N="2" REF="21">influence has been known to pro|duce, one is led to reflect with the mo&s;t &s;anguine hope on the beneficial effects to be expected from the &s;ame powerful force when exerted in its true direction.</P>
<P>The general &s;tate of civilized &s;ociety depends more than tho&s;e are aware, who are not accu&s;tomed to &s;crutinize into the &s;prings of human action, on the prevailing &s;entiments and habits of women, and on the nature degree of the e&s;timation in which they are held. Even tho&s;e who admit the power of female elegance on the manners of men, do not always attend to the influence of female principles on their character. In the former ca&s;e, in|deed, women are apt to be &s;ufficiently con&s;cious of their power, and not back|ward in turning it to account. But there are nobler objects to be effected by the exertion of their powers; and unfortu|nately, ladies, who are often unrea&s;onably confident where they ought to be diffident, are &s;ometimes capriciou&s;ly diffident ju&s;t when they ought to feel where their
<PB N="3" REF="22">true importance lies; and, feeling, to exert it. To u&s;e their boa&s;ted power over man|kind to no higher purpo&s;e than the gratifi|cation of vanity or the indulgence of plea&s;ure, is the degrading triumph of tho&s;e fair victims to luxury, caprice, and de&s;poti&s;m, whom the laws and the re|ligion of the voluptuous prophet of Arabia exclude from light, and liberty, and know|ledge; and it is humbling to reflect, that in tho&s;e countries in which fondne&s;s for the mere per&s;ons of women is carried to the highe&s;t exce&s;s, <HI>they are &s;laves;</HI> and that their moral and intellectual degradation increa&s;es in direct proportion to the adora|tion which is paid to mere external charms.</P>
<P>But I turn to the bright rever&s;e of this mortifying &s;cene; to a country where our &s;ex enjoys the ble&s;&s;ings of liberal in|&s;truction, of rea&s;onable laws, of a pure religion, and all the endearing plea&s;ures of an equal, &s;ocial, virtuous, and delightful intercour&s;e: I turn to them with a con|fident hope, that women, thus richly en|dowed with the bounties of Providence,
<PB N="4" REF="23">will not content them&s;elves with poli&s;hing, when they are able to reform; with enter|taining, when they may awaken; and with captivating for a day, when they may bring into action powers of which the effects may be commen&s;urate with eternity.</P>
<P>In this moment of alarm and peril, I would call on them with a "warning "voice," which &s;hould &s;tir up every latent principle in their minds, and kindle every &s;lumbering energy in their hearts; I would call on them to come forward, and contribute their full and fair pro|portion towards the &s;aving of their country. But I would call on them to come forward, without departing from the refinement of their character, without derogating from the dignity of their rank, without blemi&s;h|ing the delicacy of their &s;ex: I would call them to the be&s;t and mo&s;t appropriate exertion of their power, to rai&s;e the de|pre&s;&s;ed tone of public morals, to awaken the drow&s;y &s;pirit of religious principle, and to re-animate the dormant powers of active piety. They know too well how
<PB N="5" REF="24">imperiou&s;ly they give the law to manners, and with how de&s;potic a &s;way they fix the &s;tandard of fa&s;hion. But this is not enough; this is a low mark, a prize not worthy of their high and holy calling. For, on the u&s;e which women of the &s;uperior cla&s;s may be di&s;po&s;ed to make of that power delegated to them by the courte&s;y of cu&s;tom, by the hone&s;t gallantry of the heart, by the imperious controul of virtuous affections, by the habits of civi|lized &s;tates, by the u&s;ages of poli&s;hed &s;ociety; on the u&s;e, I &s;ay, which they &s;hall hereafter make of this influence, will depend, in no low degree, the well-being of tho&s;e &s;tates, and the virtue and happine&s;s, nay perhaps the very exi&s;tence of that &s;ociety.</P>
<P>At this period, when our country can only hope to &s;tand by oppo&s;ing a bold and noble <HI>unanimity</HI> to the mo&s;t tremendous con|federacies again&s;t religion and order, and go|vernments, which the world ever &s;aw; what an acce&s;&s;ion would it bring to the public
<PB N="6" REF="25">&s;trength, could we prevail on beauty, and rank, and talents, and virtue, confederating their &s;everal powers, to come forward with a patrioti&s;m at once firm and feminine for the general good! I am not &s;ounding an alarm to female warriors, or exciting female politicians: I hardly know which of the two is the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting and unnatural character. Propriety is to a woman what the great Roman critic &s;ays action is to an orator; it is the fir&s;t, the &s;econd, the third requi&s;ite. A woman may be knowing, active, witty, and amu|&s;ing; but without propriety &s;he cannot be amiable. Propriety is the centre in which all the lines of duty and of agreeablene&s;s meet. It is to character what proportion is to figure, and grace to attitude. It does not depend on any one per&s;ection; but it is the re&s;ult of general excellence. It &s;hows it&s;elf by a regular, orderly, undeviating cour&s;e; and never &s;tarts from its fober orbit into any &s;plendid eccentricities; for it would be a&s;hamed of &s;uch prai&s;e as
<PB N="7" REF="26">it might extort by any aberrations from its proper path. It renounces all com|mendation but what is characteri&s;tic; and I would make it the criterion of true ta&s;te, right principle, and genuine feeling, in a woman, whether &s;he would be le&s;s touched with all the flattery of romantic and exaggerated panegyric, than with that beautiful picture of correct and elegant propriety, which Milton draws of our fir&s;t mother, when he delineates</P>
<Q><L>Tho&s;e thou&s;and <HI>decencies</HI> which daily flow</L>
<L>From all her words and actions.</L></Q>
<P>Even the influence of religion is to be exerci&s;ed with di&s;cretion. A female Po|lemic wanders almo&s;t as far from the limits pre&s;cribed to her &s;ex, as a female Machiavel or warlike Thale&s;tris. Fierce|ne&s;s and bigotry have made almo&s;t as few converts as the &s;word, and both are pe|culiarly ungraceful in a female. Even <HI>religious</HI> violence has human tempers of its own to indulge, and is gratifying it&s;elf
<PB N="8" REF="27">when it would be thought to be "work|ing "the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God." But the character of a con&s;i&s;tent Chri&s;tian is as carefully to be maintained, as that of a fiery di&s;putant is to be avoided; and &s;he who is afraid to avow her principles, or a&s;hamed to defend them, has little claim to that honourable title. A pro|fligate, who laughs at the mo&s;t &s;acred in|&s;titutions, and keeps out of the way of every thing which comes under the ap|pearance of formal in&s;truction, may be di&s;|concerted by the mode&s;t, but &s;pirited re|buke of a delicate woman, who&s;e life adorns the doctrines which her conver|&s;ation defends: but &s;he who admini&s;ters reproof with ill-breeding, defeats the effect of her remedy. On the other hand, there is a di&s;hone&s;t way of labouring to con|ciliate the favour of a whole company, though of characters and principles irre|concilably oppo&s;ite. The words may be &s;o guarded as not to &s;hock the believer, while the eye and voice may be &s;o accom|modated,

Nor is ridicule more dangerous to true piety than to true ta&s;te.

Nothing chills the ardours of devo|tion like a frigid &s;arca&s;m; and, in the &s;ea&s;on of youth, the mind &s;hould be kept particularly clear of all light a&s;&s;ociations. This is of &s;o much importance, that I have known per&s;ons who, having been early accu&s;tomed to certain ludicrous com|binations, were never able to get their minds clean&s;ed from the impurities contracted by this habitual levity, even after a thorough reformation in their hearts and lives had taken place: their principles became reformed, but their ima|ginations were indelibly &s;oiled. They could de&s;i&s;t from &s;ins which the &s;trictne&s;s
<PB N="17" REF="36">of Chri&s;tianity forbade them to commit, but they could not di&s;mi&s;s from their minds images, which her purity would not allow them to entertain.</P>
<P>There was a time when a variety of epithets were thought nece&s;&s;ary to expre&s;s various kinds of excellence, and when the different qualities of the mind were di&s;|tingui&s;hed by appropriate and di&s;crimi|nating terms; when the words venerable, learned, &s;agacious, profound, acute, pious, ingenious, elegant, agreeable, wi&s;e or witty, were u&s;ed as &s;pecific marks of di&s;tinct characters. But the legi&s;lators of fa&s;hion have of late years thought proper to compri&s;e all merit in one e&s;tabli&s;hed epithet, and it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed to be a very de&s;irable one as far as it goes. This epithet is exclu&s;ively and indi&s;cri|minately applied wherever commendation is intended. The word <HI>plea&s;ant</HI> now &s;erves to combine and expre&s;s all moral and intellectual excellence. Every individual, from the grave&s;t profe&s;&s;ors of the grave&s;t
<PB N="18" REF="37">profe&s;&s;ion, down to the trifler who is of no profe&s;&s;ion at all, mu&s;t earn the epithet of <HI>plea&s;ant,</HI> or mu&s;t be contented to be nothing; but mu&s;t be con&s;igned over to ridicule, under the vulgar and in|expre&s;&s;ive cant word of a <HI>bore.</HI> This is the mortifying de&s;ignation of many a re&s;pectable man, who, though of much worth and much ability, cannot perhaps clearly make out his letters patent to the title of <HI>plea&s;ant.</HI> But, according to this modem cla&s;&s;i&s;ication, there is no inter|mediate &s;tate, but all are compri&s;ed within the ample bounds of one or other of the&s;e two terms.</P>
<P>We ought to be more on our guard again&s;t this &s;pirit of ridicule, becau&s;e, whatever may be the character of the pre&s;ent day, its faults do not &s;pring from the redundancies of great qualities, or the overflowings of extravagant virtues. It is well if more correct views of life, a more regular admini&s;tration of laws, and a more &s;ettled &s;tate of &s;ociety, have
<PB N="19" REF="38">helped to re&s;train the exce&s;&s;es of the heroic ages; when love and war were con&s;idered as the great and &s;ole bu&s;ine&s;s of human life. Yet, if that period was marked by a romantic extravagance, and the pre&s;ent by an indolent &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, our &s;uperiority is not &s;o triumphantly deci&s;ive, as, in the vanity of our hearts, we may be ready to imagine.</P>
<P>I do not wi&s;h to bring back the frantic reign of chivalry, nor to rein&s;tate women in that fanta&s;tic empire in which they then &s;at enthroned in the hearts, or rather in the imaginations of men. Common &s;en&s;e is an excellent material of univer&s;al application, which the &s;agacity of latter ages has &s;eized upon, and rationally applied to the bu&s;ine&s;s of common life. But let us not forget, in the in&s;olence of acknowledged &s;uperiority, that it was religion and cha&s;tity, operating on the romantic &s;pirit of tho&s;e times, which e&s;tab|li&s;hed the de&s;potic &s;way of woman; and though &s;he now no longer looks down
<PB N="20" REF="39">on her adoring votaries, from the pede&s;tal to which an ab&s;urd idolatry had li&s;ted her, yet let her remember that it is the &s;ame religion and cha&s;tity which once rai&s;ed her to &s;uch an elevation, that mu&s;t &s;till furni&s;h the noble&s;t energies of her character.</P>
<P>While we lawfully ridicule the ab&s;urd|ities which we have abandoned, let us not plume our&s;elves on that &s;pirit of novelty which glories in the oppo&s;ite ex|treme. If the manners of the period in que&s;tion were affected, and if the gal|lantry was unnatural, yet the tone of virtue was high; and let us remember that con&s;tancy, purity, and honour, are not ridiculous in them&s;elves, though they may unluckily be a&s;&s;ociated with qualities which are &s;o: and women of delicacy would do well to reflect, when de&s;canting on tho&s;e exploded manners, how far it be decorous to deride with too broad a laugh, attachments which could &s;ub&s;i&s;t on remote gratifications; or gro&s;sly to ridicule the
<PB N="21" REF="40">ta&s;te which led the admirer to &s;acrifice plea&s;ure to re&s;pect, and inclination to honour; to &s;neer at that purity which made &s;elf-denial a proof of affection, and to call in que&s;tion the found under&s;tanding of him who preferred the fame of his mi&s;tre&s;s to his own indulgence.</P>
<P>One cannot but be &s;truck with the wonderful contra&s;t exhibited to our view, when we contemplate the manners of the two periods in que&s;tion. In the former, all the flower of Europe &s;mit with a delirious gallantry; all that was young and noble, and brave and great, with a fanatic frenzy and prepo&s;terous con|tempt of danger, traver&s;ed &s;eas, and &s;caled mountains, and compa&s;&s;ed a large portion of the globe, at the expence of ea&s;e, and for|tune, and life, for the unprofitable project of re&s;cuing, by force of arms, from the hands of infidels, the &s;epulchre of that Saviour, whom, <HI>in the other period,</HI> their po&s;terity would think it the height of fanatici&s;m &s;o much as to name in good company:
<PB N="22" REF="41">who&s;e altars they de&s;ert, who&s;e temples they neglect; and though in more than one country at lea&s;t they &s;till call them|&s;elves by his name, yet too many con&s;ider it rather as a political than a religious di&s;tinction; too many, it is to be feared, contemn his precepts; &s;till more are a&s;hamed of his doctrines, and not a few reject his &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>But in an age when inver&s;ion is the order of the day, the modern idea of improvement does not con&s;i&s;t in altering, but extirpating. We do not reform, but &s;ubvert. We do not correct old &s;y&s;tems, but demoli&s;h them, fancying that when every thing &s;hall be new it will be perfect. Not to have been wrong, but to have been at all is the crime. Excellence is no longer con&s;idered as an experimental thing which is to grow gradually out of ob&s;ervation and practice, and to be improved by the accumulating additions brought by the wi&s;dom of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ages. <HI>Our</HI> wi&s;dom is not a child perfected by
<PB N="23" REF="42">gradual growth, but a godde&s;s which &s;tarts at once, full grown, mature, armed cap|a-pee, from the heads of our modern thun|derers. Or rather, if I may change the allu&s;ion, a perfect &s;y&s;tem is <HI>now</HI> expected inevitably to &s;pring at once, like the fabled bird of Arabia, from the a&s;hes of its pa|rent, and can receive its birth no other way but by the de&s;truction of its predece&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of clearing away what is re|dundant, pruning what is cumber&s;ome, &s;upplying what is defective, and amending what is wrong, we adopt the indefinite rage for radical reform of Jack, who, in altering Lord Peter's <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Swift's "Tale of a Tub."</NOTE> coat, &s;hewed his zeal by crying out, <Q>Tear away, brother Martin, for the love of heaven; never mind, &s;o you do but tear away.</Q></P>
<P>This tearing &s;y&s;tem has unque&s;tionably rent away &s;ome valuable parts of that &s;trong, rich, native &s;tuff which formed the antient texture of Briti&s;h manners. That we have gained much I am per&s;uaded;
<PB N="24" REF="43">that we have lo&s;t nothing I dare not there|fore affirm. And though it fairly ex|hibits a mark of our improved judgment to ridicule the fanta&s;tic notions of love and honour in the heroic ages; let us not rejoice that that &s;pirit of genero&s;ity in &s;en|timent, and of ardour in piety, the exuberancies of which were then &s;o incon|venient, are now &s;unk as unrea&s;onably low. That revolution of manners which the unparalleled wit and genius of Don Quixote &s;o happily effected, by aboli&s;hing extravagancies the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and perni|cious, was &s;o far imperfect, that the virtues which he never meant to expo&s;e, fell into di&s;repute with the ab&s;urdities which he did: and it is become the turn of the pre&s;ent ta&s;te to attach in no &s;mall degree that which is ridiculous to that which is heroic. Some modern works of wit have a&s;&s;i&s;ted in bringing piety and &s;ome of the noble&s;t virtues into contempt, by &s;tudiou&s;ly a&s;&s;ociating them with oddity, childi&s;h &s;im|plicity, and ignorance of the world: and unnece&s;&s;ary pains have been taken to
<PB N="25" REF="44">extingui&s;h that zeal and ardour, which, however liable to exce&s;s and error, are yet the &s;pring of whatever is great and excellent in the human character. The novel of Cervantes is incomparable; the Tartuffe of Moliere is unequalled; but true genero&s;ity and true religion will never lo&s;e any thing of their intrin&s;ic value, becau&s;e knight-errantry and hypocri&s;y are legitimate objects for &s;atire.</P>
<P>But to return from this too long di|gre&s;&s;ion, to the &s;ubject of female influence. Tho&s;e who have not watched the united operation of vanity and feeling on a youth|ful mind, will not conceive how much le&s;s formidable the ridicule of all his own &s;ex will be to a very young man, than that of tho&s;e women to whom he has been taught to look up as the arbitre&s;&s;es of elegance. Such an one, I doubt not, might be able to work him&s;elf up, by the force of genuine chri&s;tian principle, to &s;uch a pitch of true heroi&s;m, as to refu&s;e a challenge, (and it requires more real courage to refu&s;e a challenge than to
<PB N="26" REF="45">accept one,) who would yet be in danger of relap&s;ing into the dreadful pu&s;illanimity of the world, when he is told that no woman of fa&s;hion will hereafter look on him but with contempt. While we have cleared away the rubbi&s;h of the Gothic ages, it were to be wi&s;hed we had not retained the mo&s;t criminal of all their in&s;titutions. Why chivalry &s;hould indicate a madman, while its leading object, the <HI>&s;ingle combat,</HI> &s;hould de&s;ignate a gentleman, has not yet been explained. Nay the original motive is lo&s;t, while the &s;inful practice is con|tinued; for the fighter of the duel no longer <HI>pretends</HI> to be a glorious redre&s;&s;er of the wrongs of &s;trangers; no longer con|&s;iders him&s;elf as piou&s;ly appealing to hea|ven for the ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e; but from the &s;lavi&s;h fear of unmerited re|proach, often &s;elfi&s;hly hazards the happi|ne&s;s of his neare&s;t connections, and always comes forth in direct defiance of an acknowledged command of the Almighty. Perhaps there are few occa&s;ions in which female influence might be exerted to a
<PB N="27" REF="46">higher purpo&s;e than in this, in which laws and con&s;cience have hitherto effected &s;o little; but while the duelli&s;t (who per|haps becomes a duelli&s;t only becau&s;e he was fir&s;t a &s;educer) is welcomed with &s;miles; the more hardy youth, who, not becau&s;e he fears man but God, declines a challenge; who is re&s;olved to brave di&s;grace rather than commit &s;in, would be treated with cool contempt by tho&s;e very per&s;ons to who&s;e e&s;teem he might rea&s;onably look, as one of the rewards of his true and &s;ub&s;tantial fortitude.</P>
<P>But how &s;hall it be reconciled with the deci&s;ions of principle, that delicate women &s;hould receive with complacency the &s;uc|ce&s;sful libertine, who has been detected by the wretched father or the injured hu&s;band in a criminal commerce, the di&s;covery of which has too ju&s;tly bani&s;hed the unhappy partner of his crime from virtuous &s;ociety? Nay, if he happen to be very hand&s;ome, or very brave, or very fa&s;hionable, is there not &s;ometimes a kind of di&s;honourable
<PB N="28" REF="47">competition for his favour? But, whether his popularity be derived from birth, or parts, or per&s;on, or (what is often a &s;ub|&s;titute for all) from his having made his way into <HI>good company,</HI> women of di&s;tinction &s;ully the &s;anctity of virtue by the too vi&s;ible plea&s;ure they &s;ometimes expre&s;s at the attentions of a popular liber|tine, who&s;e voluble &s;mall talk they admire, and who&s;e &s;prightly nothings they quote, and whom perhaps their very favour tends to prevent from becoming a better cha|racter, becau&s;e he finds him&s;elf more acceptable as he is.</P>
<P>May I be allowed to introduce a new part of my &s;ubject, by remarking that it is a matter of inconceivable importance, though not perhaps &s;ufficiently con&s;idered, when any popular work, not on a religious topic, but on any common &s;ubject, &s;uch as politics, hi&s;tory, or &s;cience, has happened to be written by an author of &s;ound Chri&s;tian prineiples? It may not have been nece&s;&s;ary, nor prudently practicable, to have a &s;ingle
<PB N="29" REF="48">page in the whole work profe&s;&s;edly religious: but &s;till, when the living principle informs the mind of the writer, it is almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible but that &s;omething of its &s;pirit will diffu&s;e it&s;elf even into &s;ubjects with which it &s;hould &s;eem but remotely connected. It is at lea&s;t a comfort to the reader, to feel that hone&s;t confidence which re&s;ults from knowing that he has put him&s;elf into &s;afe hands; that he has committed him&s;elf to an author, who&s;e known principles are a pledge that his reader need not be driven to watch him&s;elf at every &s;tep with anxious circum&s;pection; that he need not be looking on the right hand and on the left, as if he knew there were pitfalls under the flowers which are delighting him. And it is no &s;mall point gained, that on &s;ubjects in which you do not look to <HI>improve</HI> your religion, it is at lea&s;t &s;ecured from deterioration. If the Athenian laws were &s;o delicate that they di&s;graced any one who &s;hewed an inquiring traveller the wrong road, what di&s;grace, among Chri&s;t|ians,
<PB N="30" REF="49">ians, &s;hould attach to that author who, when a youth is inquiring the road to hi&s;tory or philo&s;ophy, directs him to bla&s;phemy and unbelief?</P>
<P>In animadverting farther on the reign|ing evils which the times more particularly demand that women of rank and influence &s;hould repre&s;s, Chri&s;tianity calls upon them to bear their decided te&s;timony again&s;t every thing which is notoriou&s;ly contri|buting to the public corruption. It calls upon them to bani&s;h from their dre&s;&s;ing rooms, (and oh, that their influence could bani&s;h from the libraries of their &s;ons and hu&s;bands!) that &s;ober and un&s;u&s;pected ma&s;s of mi&s;chief, which, by a&s;&s;uming the plau&s;ible names of Science, of Philo&s;ophy, of Arts, of Belles Lettres, is gradually ad|mini&s;tering death to the principles of tho&s;e who would be on their guard, had the poi&s;on been labelled with its own pernicious title.

He exhibits a virtuous woman, the victim not of tempta|tion but of rea&s;on, not of vice but of &s;entiment, not of pa&s;&s;ion but of con|viction; and &s;trikes at the very root of honour by elevating a crime into a principle. With a metaphy&s;ical &s;ophi&s;try the mo&s;t plau&s;ible, he debauches the heart of woman, by cheri&s;hing her vanity in the erection of a &s;y&s;tem of male virtues, to which, with a lofty dereliction of tho&s;e that are her more peculiar and cha|racteri&s;tic prai&s;e, he tempts her to a&s;pire; powerfully in&s;inuating, that to this &s;plendid &s;y&s;tem cha&s;tity does not nece&s;&s;arily belong:
<PB N="33" REF="54">thus corrupting the judgment and be|wildering the under&s;tanding, as the mo&s;t effectual way to inflame the imagination and deprave the heart.</P>
<P>The rare mi&s;chief of this author con&s;i&s;ts in his power of &s;educing by fal&s;ehood tho&s;e who love truth, but who&s;e minds are &s;till wavering, and who&s;e principles are not yet formed. He allures the warm|hearted to embrace vice, not becau&s;e they prefer vice, but becau&s;e he gives to vice &s;o natural an air of virtue: and ardent and enthu&s;ia&s;tic youth, too confidently tru&s;ting in their integrity and in their teacher, will be undone, while they fancy they are in|dulging in the noble&s;t feelings of their nature. Many authors will more infallibly complete the ruin of the loo&s;e and ill-di&s;po&s;ed; but perhaps (if I may change the figure) there never was a net of &s;uch exqui&s;ite art and inextricable workman|&s;hip, &s;pread to entangle innocence and en&s;nare inexperience, as the writings of Rou&s;&s;eau: and, unhappily, the victim does
<PB N="34" REF="55">not even &s;truggle in the toils, becau&s;e part of the delu&s;ion con&s;i&s;ts in imagining that he is &s;et at liberty.</P>
<P>Some of our recent popular publica|tions have adopted all the mi&s;chiefs of this &s;chool, and the principal evil ari&s;ing from them is, that the virtues they exhibit are almo&s;t more dangerous than the vices. The chief materials out of which the&s;e delu&s;ive &s;y&s;tems are framed, are characters who practi&s;e &s;uperfluous acts of gene|ro&s;ity, while they are trampling on obvious and commanded duties; who combine &s;entiments of honour with actions the mo&s;t flagitious: a high-tone of &s;elf-confidence, with a perpetual breach of &s;elf-denial: pathetic apo&s;trophes to the pa&s;&s;ions, but no attempt to re&s;i&s;t them. They teach that no duty exi&s;ts which is not prompted by feeling: that impul&s;e is the main &s;pring of virtuous actions, while laws and principles are only unju&s;t re&s;traints; the former impo&s;ed by arbitrary men, the latter by the ab&s;urd prejudices of timorous
<PB N="35" REF="56">and unenlightened con&s;cience. In &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;plendid of the&s;e characters, compa&s;&s;ion is erected into the throne of ju&s;tice, and ju&s;tice is degraded into the rank of plebeian virtues. Creditors are defrauded, while the money due to them is lavi&s;hed in dazzling acts of charity to &s;ome object that affected their &s;en&s;es; which fits of charity are made the &s;ponge of every &s;in; and the &s;ub&s;titute of every virtue: the whole indirectly tending to intimate how very <HI>benevolent people are who are not Chri&s;tians.</HI> From many of the&s;e compo&s;itions, indeed, Chri&s;tianity is &s;y&s;tem|atically, and always virtually excluded; for the law and the prophets and the go&s;pel <HI>can</HI> make no part of a &s;cheme in which this world is looked upon as all in all; in which poverty and mi&s;ery are con|&s;idered as evils ari&s;ing &s;olely from human governments, and not from the di&s;pen&s;a|tions of God: this poverty is repre&s;ented as the greate&s;t of evils, and the re&s;traints which tend to keep the poor hone&s;t, as
<PB N="36" REF="57">the mo&s;t flagrant inju&s;tice. The go&s;pel can have nothing to do with a &s;y&s;tem in which &s;in is reduced to a little human imperfection, and Old Bailey crimes are &s;oftened down into a few engaging weak|ne&s;&s;es; and in which the turpitude of all the vices a man him&s;elf commits, is done away by his <HI>candour</HI> in tolerating all the vices committed by others.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t fatal part of the &s;y&s;tem to that cla&s;s whom I am addre&s;&s;ing is, that even in tho&s;e works which do not go all the lengths of treating marriage as an unju&s;t infringement on liberty, and a tyrannical deduction from general happi|ne&s;s; yet it commonly happens that the hero or heroine, who has practically violated the letter of the &s;eventh com|mandment, and continues to live in the allowed violation of its &s;pirit, is painted as &s;o amiable and &s;o benevolent, &s;o tender or &s;o brave; and the temptation is re|pre&s;ented as &s;o <HI>irre&s;i&s;tible,</HI> (for all the&s;e philo&s;ophers are fatali&s;ts,) the predominant
<PB N="37" REF="58">and cheri&s;hed &s;in is &s;o filtered and purged of its pollutions, and is &s;o &s;heltered and &s;urrounded, and relieved with &s;hining qualities, that the innocent and impre&s;&s;ible young reader is brought to lo&s;e all horror of the awful crime in que&s;tion, in the complacency &s;he feels for the engaging virtues of the criminal.</P>
<P>But there is a new and &s;trong demand for the exertion of that power I am humbly endeavouring to direct to its true end. Tho&s;e ladies who take the lead in &s;ociety are loudly called upon to act as the guardians of public ta&s;te as well as public virtue, in an important in&s;tance. They are called upon to oppo&s;e with the whole weight of their influence, the irruption of tho&s;e &s;warms of publications that are daily i&s;&s;uing from the banks of the Danube; which, like their ravaging pre|dece&s;&s;ors of the darker ages, though with far other arms, are overrunning civilized &s;ociety. Tho&s;e readers, who&s;e purer ta&s;te has been formed on the correct models
<PB N="38" REF="59">of the old cla&s;&s;ic &s;chool, &s;ee with indigna|tion and a&s;toni&s;hment the Vandals once more overpowering the Greeks and Ro|mans. They behold our minds, with a retrograde but rapid motion, hurried back to the reign of "chaos and old night," by wild and mis-&s;hapen &s;uper&s;titions; in which, with that <HI>con&s;i&s;tency</HI> which forms &s;o &s;triking a feature of the new philo&s;ophy, tho&s;e who deny the immortality of the &s;oul are mo&s;t eager to introduce the machinery of gho&s;ts; and by terri&s;ic and unprin|cipled compo&s;itions, which unite the ta&s;te of the Goths with the morals of Bag&s;hot <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The new&s;papers announce that Schiller's 'Tragedy of the Robbers, which inflamed the young nobility of Germany to inli&s;t them&s;elves into a band of highwaymen to rob in the fore&s;ts of Bohemia, is <HI>now acting in England by per&s;ons of quality!</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Gorgons, and Hydras, and Chimeras dire!</P>
<P>The writings of the French infidels were &s;ome years ago circulated in England with uncommon indu&s;try, and with &s;ome effect: but the good &s;en&s;e and good principles
<PB N="39" REF="60">of the far greater part of our countrymen re&s;i&s;ted the attack, and ro&s;e &s;uperior to the trial. Of the doctrines and principles here alluded to, the dreadful con&s;equences, not only in the unhappy country where they originated and were almo&s;t univer&s;ally adopted, but in every part of Europe where they have been received, have been &s;uch as to &s;erve as a beacon to &s;urrounding nations, if any warning can pre&s;erve them from de&s;truction. In this country the &s;ubject is now &s;o well under&s;tood, that every thing which i&s;&s;ues from the <HI>French</HI> pre&s;s is received with jealou&s;y; and a work, on the fir&s;t appearance of its exhibiting the doctrines of Voltaire and his a&s;&s;ociates, is rejected with indignation.</P>
<P>But let us not on account of this victory repo&s;e in confident &s;ecurity. The modern apo&s;tles of infidelity and im|morality, little le&s;s indefatigable in di&s;|per&s;ing their pernicious doctrines than the fir&s;t apo&s;tles were in propagating go&s;pel truths, have only changed their weapons,
<PB N="40" REF="61">but they have by no means de&s;i&s;ted from the attack. To de&s;troy the principles of Chri&s;tianity in this i&s;land, appears at the pre&s;ent moment to be their grand aim. Deprived of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the French pre&s;s, they are now attempting to attain their object under the clo&s;e and more artificial veil of German literature. Con|&s;cious that religion and morals will &s;tand or fall together, their attacks are &s;ome|times levelled again&s;t the one and &s;ome|times again&s;t the other. With occa&s;ional &s;trong profe&s;&s;ions of attachment to both of them, the feelings and the pa&s;&s;ions of the reader are engaged on the &s;ide of &s;ome one particular vice, or &s;ome one objection to revealed religion. Poetry as well as pro&s;e, romance as well as hi&s;tory; writings on philo&s;ophical as well as political &s;ubjects, have thus been employed to in&s;til the principles of <HI>Illuminati&s;m,</HI> while incredible pains have been taken to obtain able tran&s;la|tions of every book which it was &s;up|po&s;ed could be of u&s;e in corrupting the
<PB N="41" REF="62">heart, or mi&s;leading the under&s;tanding. In many of the&s;e tran&s;lations, the &s;tronge&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, which, though well received in Germany, would have excited di&s;gu&s;t in England, are wholly omitted, in order that the mind may be more certainly, though more &s;lowly prepared for the full effect of the poi&s;on at another period.</P>
<P>Let not tho&s;e to whom the&s;e pages are addre&s;&s;ed deceive them&s;elves, by &s;up|po&s;ing this to be a fable; but let them inquire mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly whether I &s;peak the truth, when I a&s;&s;ert that the attacks of infidelity in Great Britain are at this moment principally directed again&s;t the female brea&s;t. Con&s;cious of the influence of women in civil &s;ociety, con&s;cious of the effect which female infidelity produced in France, they attribute the ill &s;ucce&s;s of their attempts in this country to their having been hitherto chiefly addre&s;&s;ed to the male &s;ex. They are now &s;edulou&s;ly labouring to de&s;troy the religious prin|ciples
<PB N="42" REF="63">of women, and in too many in&s;tances they have fatally &s;ucceeded. For this purpo&s;e not only novels and romances have been made the vehicles of vice and infidelity, but the &s;ame allurement has been held out to the women of our country, which was employed by the original tempter to our fir&s;t parent&mdash;Knowledge. Li&s;ten to the precepts of the new German enlight|eners, and you need no longer remain in that &s;ituation in which Providence has placed you! Follow their examples, and you &s;hall be permitted to indulge in all tho&s;e gratifications which cu&s;tom, not reli|gion, has too far overlooked in the male &s;ex!</P>
<P>We have hitherto &s;poken only of the German <HI>writings;</HI> but as there are multi|tudes who never read, equal pains have been taken to promote the &s;ame object through the medium of the &s;tage: and this weapon is, of all others, that again&s;t which it is at the pre&s;ent moment the mo&s;t important to warn my countrywomen.
<PB N="43" REF="64">As a &s;pecimen of the German drama, it may not be un&s;ea&s;onable to offer a few remarks on the admired play of the <HI>Stranger.</HI> In this piece the character of an <HI>adultre&s;s,</HI> which, in all periods of the world, ancient as well modern, in all countries heathen as well as chri&s;tian, has hitherto been held in dete&s;tation, and has never been introduced but to be repro|bated, is for the fir&s;t time pre&s;ented to our view in the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and fa&s;cinat|ing colours. The heroine is a woman who for&s;ook a hu&s;band, the mo&s;t affection|ate and the mo&s;t amiable, and lived for &s;ome time in the mo&s;t criminal commerce with her &s;educer. Repenting at length of her crime, &s;he buries her&s;elf in retirement. The talents of the poet during the whole piece are exerted in attempting to render this woman the object, not only of the compa&s;&s;ion and forgivene&s;s, but of the e&s;teem and affection, of the audience. The injured hu&s;band, convinced of his wife's repentance, forms a re&s;olution, which
<PB N="44" REF="65">every man of true feeling and chri&s;tian piety will probably approve. He forgives her offence, and promi&s;es her through life his advice, protection, and fortune, together with every thing which can alle|viate the mi&s;ery of her &s;ituation, but refu&s;es to replace her in the &s;ituation of his wife. But this is not &s;ufficient for the <HI>German</HI> author. His efforts are employed, and it is to be feared but too &s;ucce&s;sfully, in making the audience con&s;ider the hu&s;band as an unrelenting &s;avage, while they are led by the art of the poet anxiou&s;ly to wi&s;h to &s;ee an adultre&s;s re&s;tored to that rank of women who have not violated the mo&s;t &s;olemn covenant that can be made with man, nor di&s;obeyed one of the mo&s;t po&s;itive laws which has been enjoined by God.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time that this fir&s;t attempt at repre&s;enting an adultre&s;s in an exemplary light was made by a German dramati&s;t, which forms an aera in man|ners; a direct vindication of adultery was
<PB N="45" REF="66">for the fir&s;t time attempted by a <HI>woman,</HI> a profe&s;&s;ed admirer and imitator of the German &s;uicide Werter. The Female Werter, as &s;he is &s;tyled by her biographer, a&s;&s;erts in a work, intitled <Q>The Wrongs of Woman,</Q> that adultery is ju&s;tifiable, and that the re&s;trictions placed on it by the laws of England con&s;titute part of the <HI>wrongs of woman.</HI></P>
<P>But let us take comfort. The&s;e fervid pictures are not yet generally reali&s;ed. The&s;e atrocious principles are not yet adopted into common practice. Though corruptions &s;eem to be pouring in upon us from every quarter, yet there is &s;till left among us a di&s;criminating judgment. Clear and &s;trongly marked di&s;tinctions between right and wrong &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t. While we continue to cheri&s;h this &s;anity of mind, the ca&s;e is not de&s;perate. Though the crime above alluded to, the growth of which always exhibits the mo&s;t irrefragable proof of the di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of public man|ners; though this crime, which cuts up
<PB N="46" REF="67">order and virtue by the roots, and violates the &s;anctity of vows, is awfully increa&s;ing,
<Q><L>'Till &s;enates &s;eem,</L>
<L>For purpo&s;es of empire le&s;s conven'd</L>
<L>Than to relea&s;e the adult're&s;s from her bonds;</L></Q>
yet, thanks to the &s;urviving efficacy of a holy religion, to the operations of virtuous laws, and the energy and un&s;haken integrity with which the&s;e laws are <HI>now</HI> admini&s;tered; and &s;till more perhaps to a &s;tandard of morals which continues in force, when the principles which fanctioned it are no more; this crime, in the female &s;ex at lea&s;t, is &s;till held in ju&s;t abhorrence; if it be practi&s;ed, it is not honourable; if it be committed, it is not ju&s;tified; we do not yet affect to palliate its turpitude; as yet it hides its abhorred head in lurking privacy; and reprobation hitherto follows its publicity.</P>
<P>But on YOUR exerting your influence, with ju&s;t application and increa&s;ing energy, it may in no &s;mall degree depend whether this corruption &s;hall &s;till continue to be
<PB N="47" REF="68">re&s;i&s;ted. For, from admiring to adopt|ing, the &s;tep is &s;hort, and the progre&s;s rapid; and it is in the moral as in the na|tural world, the motion, in the ca&s;e of minds as well as of bodies, is accelerated on a nearer approach to the centre to which they are tending.</P>
<P>O ye to whom this addre&s;s is par|ticularly directed! an awful charge is, in this in&s;tance, committed to your hands; as you &s;hrink from it or di&s;charge it, you promote or injure the honour of your daughters and the happine&s;s of your &s;ons, of both which you are the depo&s;itaries. And, while you re&s;olutely per&s;evere in making a &s;tand again&s;t the encroachments of this crime, &s;uffer not your firmne&s;s to be &s;haken by that affect|ation of charity, which is growing into a general &s;ub&s;titute for principle. Abu&s;e not &s;o noble a quality as Chri&s;tian can|dour, by mi&s;employing it in in&s;tances to which it does not apply. Pity the wretched woman you dare not coun|tenance;
<PB N="48" REF="69">and ble&s;s HIM who has <Q>made you to differ.</Q> If unhappily &s;he be your relation or friend, anxiou&s;ly watch for the period when &s;he &s;hall be de&s;erted by her betrayer; and &s;ee if, by your Chri&s;tian offices, &s;he can be &s;natched from a perpetuity of vice. But if, through the Divine ble&s;&s;ing on your patient endeavours, &s;he &s;hould ever be awakened to remor&s;e, be not anxious to re&s;tore the forlorn penitent to that &s;ociety again&s;t who&s;e laws &s;he has &s;o grievou&s;ly offended; and re|member, that her &s;oliciting &s;uch a re&s;tora|tion, furni&s;hes but too plain a proof that &s;he is not the penitent your partiality would believe; &s;ince penitence is more anxious to make its peace with heaven, than with the world. Joyfully would a truly contrite &s;pirit commute an earthly for an everla&s;t|ing reprobation! To re&s;tore a criminal to public &s;ociety, is perhaps to tempt her to repeat her crime, or to deaden her repent|ance for having committed it; while to re&s;tore a &s;trayed &s;oul to God will add
<PB N="49" REF="70">lu&s;tre to your Chri&s;tian character, and brighten your eternal crown.</P>
<P>In the mean time, there are other evils, ultimately perhaps tending to this, into which we are falling, through that &s;ort of fa&s;hionable candour which, as was hinted above, is among the mi&s;chievous cha|racteri&s;tics of the pre&s;ent day. Of which period perhaps it is not the &s;malle&s;t evil, that vices are made to look &s;o like virtues, and are &s;o a&s;&s;imilated with them, that it re|quires watchfulne&s;s and judgment to analyze them and to di&s;criminate between them. There are certain women of good fa&s;hion who practi&s;e irregularities not con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;trictne&s;s of virtue; while their good &s;en&s;e and knowledge of the world make them at the &s;ame time keenly alive to the value of reputation. They want to retain their indulgences, without quite forfeiting their credit; but finding their fame fa&s;t declining, they artfully cling, by flattery and marked attentions, to a few
<PB N="50" REF="71">per&s;ons of more than ordinary character; and thus, till they are driven to let go their hold, continue to prop a falling fame.</P>
<P>On the other hand, there are not want|ing women of di&s;tinction, of very correct general conduct, and of no ordinary &s;en&s;e and virtue, who, confiding with a high mind on what they too confidently call <HI>the integrity of their own hearts;</HI> anxious of de&s;erving a good fame on the one hand, by a life free from reproach, yet &s;ecretly too de&s;irous on the other of &s;ecuring a worldly and fa&s;hionable reputation; while their general a&s;&s;ociates are per&s;ons of honour, and their general re&s;ort places of &s;afety; yet allow them&s;elves to be occa|&s;ionally pre&s;ent at the midnight orgies of revelry and gaming, in hou&s;es of no honourable e&s;timation; and thus help to keep up characters, which, without their &s;u&s;taining hand, would &s;ink to their ju&s;t level of reprobation and contempt. While
<PB N="51" REF="72">they are holding out this plank to a drowning reputation, rather, it is to be feared, to &s;how their own &s;trength than to a&s;&s;i&s;t another's weakne&s;s, they value them&s;elves, perhaps, on not partaking of the wor&s;t parts of the amu&s;ements which may be carrying on; but they &s;anction them by their pre&s;ence; they lend their countenance to corruptions they &s;hould abhor, and their example to the young and inexperienced, who are looking about for &s;ome &s;uch &s;anction to ju&s;tify them in what they were before inclined to do, but were too timid to have done without the protection of &s;uch un&s;ullied names. Thus the&s;e re&s;pectable characters, without looking to the general con&s;equences of their indi&s;cretion, are thoughtle&s;sly em|ployed in breaking down, as it were, the broad fence, which &s;hould ever &s;eparate two very different &s;orts of &s;ociety, and are becoming a kind of unnatural link between vice and virtue.</P>

<PB N="57" REF="78">life be a &s;chool to fit us for eternity; if &s;uch, I repeat it, be the chief work and grand ends of education, it may then be worth inquiring how far the&s;e ends are likely to be effected by the prevailing &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Is it not a fundamental error to con&s;ider children as innocent beings, who&s;e little weakne&s;&s;es may perhaps want &s;ome cor|rection, rather than as beings who bring into the world a corrupt nature and evil di&s;po&s;itions, which it &s;hould be the great end of education to rectify? This appears to be &s;uch a foundation-truth, that if I were a&s;ked what quality is mo&s;t im|portant in an in&s;tructor of youth, I &s;hould not he&s;itate to reply, <HI>&s;uch a &s;trong im|pre&s;&s;ion of the corruption of our nature, as &s;hould in&s;ure a di&s;po&s;ition to counteract it; together with &s;uch a deep view and thorough knowledge of the human heart, as &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary for developing and controlling its mo&s;t &s;ecret and complicated workings.</HI> And let us remember that to <HI>know the world,</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="79">as it is called, that is, to know its local manners, temporary u&s;ages, and evane&s;cent fa&s;hions, is not to <HI>know human nature:</HI> and where this la&s;t mentioned know|ledge is wanting, tho&s;e natural evils which ought to be counteracted will be fo&s;tered.</P>
<P>Vanity, for in&s;tance, is reckoned among the light and venial errors of youth; nay, &s;o far from being treated as a dangerous enemy, it is often called in as an auxiliary. At wor&s;t, it is con&s;idered as a harmle&s;s weakne&s;s, which &s;ubtracts little from the value of a character; as a natural effer|ve&s;cence, which will &s;ub&s;ide of it&s;elf, when the fir&s;t ferment of the youthful pa&s;&s;ions &s;hall have done working. But tho&s;e know little of the conformation of the human, and e&s;pecially of the female heart, who fancy that vanity is ever exhau&s;ted, by the mere operation of time and events. Let tho&s;e who maintain this opinion look into our places of public re&s;ort, and there be|hold if the gho&s;t of departed beauty is not to its la&s;t flitting fond of haunting the
<PB N="59" REF="80">&s;cenes of its pa&s;t plea&s;ures; the &s;oul, un|willing (if I may borrow an allu&s;ion from the Platonic mythology) to quit the &s;pot in which the body enjoyed its former delights, &s;till continues to hover about the &s;ame place, though the &s;ame plea&s;ures are no longer to be found there. Di&s;appoint|ments indeed may divert vanity into a new direction; prudence may prevent it from breaking out into exce&s;&s;es, and age may prove that it is "vexation of "&s;pirit;" but neither di&s;appointment, prudence, nor age can <HI>cure</HI> it; for they do not correct the principle. Nay, the very di&s;appointment it&s;elf &s;erves as a painful evidence of its exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Since then there is a &s;ea&s;on when the youthful mu&s;t cea&s;e to be young, and the beautiful to excite admiration; to grow old gracefully is perhaps one of the rare&s;t and mo&s;t valuable arts which can be taught to woman. It is for this &s;ober &s;ea&s;on of life that education &s;hould lay up its rich re&s;ources. However di&s;regarded they may
<PB N="60" REF="81">hitherto have been, they will be wanted now. When admirers fall away, and flatterers become mute, the mind will be driven to retire into it&s;elf, and if it find no entertainment at home, it will be driven back again upon the world with increa&s;ed force. Yet forgetting this, do we not &s;eem to educate our daughters, exclu&s;ively, for the tran&s;ient period of youth, when it is to maturer life we ought to advert? Do we not educate them for a crowd, forgetting that they are to live at home? for the world, and not for them&s;elves? for &s;how, and not for u&s;e? for time, and not for eternity?</P>
<P>Vanity (and the &s;ame may be &s;aid of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s) is not to be re&s;i&s;ted like any other vice, which is &s;ometimes bu&s;y and &s;ometimes quiet; it is not to be attacked as a &s;ingle fault, which is indulged in oppo&s;ition to a &s;ingle virtue; but it is uniformly to be controlled, as an active, a re&s;tle&s;s, a growing principle, at con&s;tant war with all the Chri&s;tian graces; which
<PB N="61" REF="82">not only mixes it&s;elf with all our faults, but in&s;inuates it&s;elf into all our virtues too; and will, if not checked effectually, rob our be&s;t actions of their reward. Vanity, if I may u&s;e the analogy, is, with re&s;pect to the other vices, what feeling is in regard to the other &s;en&s;es; it is not confined in its operation to the eye, or the ear, or any &s;ingle organ, but diffu&s;ed through the whole being, alive in every part, awakened and communicated by the &s;lighte&s;t touch.</P>
<P>Not a few of the evils of the pre&s;ent day ari&s;e from a new and perverted application of terms; among the&s;e perhaps, there is not one more abu&s;ed, mi&s;under&s;tood, or mi&s;applied, than the term <HI>accompli&s;hments.</HI> This word in its original meaning, &s;ignifies <HI>completene&s;s, perfection.</HI> But I may &s;afely appeal to the ob&s;ervation of mankind, whether they do not meet with &s;warms of youthful females, i&s;&s;uing from our board|ing &s;chools, as well as emerging from the more private &s;cenes of dome&s;tic education,
<PB N="62" REF="83">who are introduced into the world, under the broad and univer&s;al title of <HI>accom|pli&s;hed young ladies,</HI> of <HI>all</HI> of whom it cannot very truly and correctly be pro|nounced, that they illu&s;trate the definition by a completene&s;s which leaves nothing to be added, and a perfection which leaves nothing to be de&s;ired.</P>
<P>This phrenzy of accompli&s;hments, un|happily, is no longer re&s;tricted within the u&s;ual limits of rank and fortune; the middle orders have caught the contagion, and it rages with increa&s;ing violence, from the elegantly dre&s;&s;ed but &s;lenderly por|tioned curate's daughter, to the equally fa&s;hionable daughter of the little trade&s;man, and of the more opulent, but not more judicious farmer. And is it not obvious, that as far as this epidemical mania has &s;pread, this very valuable part of fociety declines in u&s;efulne&s;s, as it ri&s;es in its unlucky preten&s;ions to elegance? And this revolution of the manners of the middle cla&s;s has &s;o far altered the cha|racter
<PB N="63" REF="84">of the age, as to be in danger of rendering ob&s;olete the heretofore common &s;aying, <Q>that mo&s;t worth and virtue are to be found in the middle &s;tation.</Q> For I do not &s;cruple to a&s;&s;ert, that in general, as far as my little ob&s;ervation has extended, this cla&s;s of females, in what relates both to religious knowledge and to practical indu&s;try, falls &s;hort both of the very high and the very low. Their new cour&s;e of education, and the habits of life, and elegance of dre&s;s connected with it, peculiarly unfits them for the active duties of their own very important condition; while, with frivolous eagerne&s;s and &s;econd|hand opportunities, they run to &s;natch a few of tho&s;e &s;howy acquirements which decorate the great. This is done appa|rently with one or other of the&s;e views; either to make their fortune by marriage, or if that fail, to qualify them to become teachers of others: hence the abundant multiplication of &s;uper&s;icial wives, and of incompetent and illiterate governe&s;&s;es.
<PB N="64" REF="85">The u&s;e of the pencil, the performance of exqui&s;ite but unnece&s;&s;ary works, the &s;tudy of foreign languages and of mu&s;ic, require (with &s;ome exceptions, which &s;hould always be made in favour of great natural genius) a degree of lei&s;ure which belongs exclu&s;ively to affluence <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e among the cla&s;s in que&s;tion, who&s;e own good &s;en&s;e leads them to avoid the&s;e mi&s;taken pur|&s;uits, cannot be offended at a reproof which does not belong to them.</NOTE> One u&s;e of learning languages is, not that we may know what the terms which expre&s;s the articles of our dre&s;s and our table are called in French or Italian; not that we may think over a few ordinary phra&s;es in Engli&s;h, and then tran&s;late them, with|out one foreign idiom; for he who cannot <HI>think</HI> in a language cannot be &s;aid to un|der&s;tand it: but the great u&s;e of acquiring any foreign language is, either that it enables us occa&s;ionally to conver&s;e with foreigners unacquainted with any other,
<PB N="65" REF="86">or that it is a key to the literature of the country to which it belongs; and tho&s;e humbler females, the chief part of who&s;e time is required for dome&s;tic offices, are little likely to fall in the way of foreigners; and &s;o far from enjoying opportunities for the acqui&s;ition of foreign literature, have &s;eldom time to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of all that valuable knowledge, which the books of their own country &s;o abundantly fur|ni&s;h; and the acqui&s;ition of which would be &s;o much more u&s;eful and honourable than the paltry acce&s;&s;ions they make, by hammering out the meaning of a few pa&s;&s;ages in a tongue they but imperfectly under&s;tand, and of which they are likely to make no u&s;e.</P>
<P>It would be well if the reflection how eagerly this redundancy of accompli&s;h|ments is &s;eized on by their inferiors, were to operate as in the ca&s;e of other ab&s;urd fa&s;hions, which the great can feldom be brought to renounce from any
<PB N="66" REF="87">other con&s;ideration than that they are adopted by the vulgar.</P>
<P>But, to return to that more elevated, and, on account of their more extended influence only, that more important cla&s;s of females, to who&s;e u&s;e this little work is more immediately dedicated. Some popular authors, on the &s;ubject of female in&s;truction, had for a time e&s;tabli&s;hed a fanta&s;tic code of artificial manners. They had refined elegance into in&s;ipidity, frittered down delicacy into frivolou&s;ne&s;s, and reduced manner into <HI>minauderie.</HI> But <Q>to li&s;p and to amble and to nick-name God's creatures,</Q> has nothing to do with true gentlene&s;s of mind; and to be &s;illy makes no nece&s;&s;ary part of &s;oftne&s;s. Another cla&s;s of cotemporary authors turned all the force of their talents to excite <HI>emotions,</HI> to in&s;pire <HI>&s;entiment,</HI> and to reduce all moral excellence into <HI>&s;ympathy</HI> and <HI>feeling.</HI> The&s;e &s;ofter qualities were elevated at the expence of principle; and young women were ince&s;&s;antly hearing
<PB N="67" REF="88">unqualified &s;en&s;ibility extolled as the per|fection of their nature; till tho&s;e who really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this amiable quality, in&s;tead of directing, and cha&s;ti&s;ing, and re&s;training it, were in danger of fo&s;tering it to their hurt, and began to con&s;ider them&s;elves as deriving their excellence from its exce&s;s; while tho&s;e le&s;s intere&s;ting dam&s;els, who happened not to find any of this amiable &s;en&s;ibility in their <HI>hearts,</HI> but thought it creditable to have it &s;omewhere, fancied its &s;eat was in the <HI>nerves;</HI> and here indeed it was ea&s;ily found or feigned; till a fal&s;e and exce&s;&s;ive di&s;play of feeling became &s;o predominant, as to bring in que&s;tion the actual exi&s;tence of that true tenderne&s;s, without which, though a woman may be worthy, &s;he can never be amiable.</P>
<P>Fa&s;hion then, by one of her &s;udden and rapid turns, in&s;tantaneou&s;ly &s;truck out &s;en&s;ibility and affectation from the &s;tanding li&s;t of female perfections; and, by a quick touch of her magic wand,
<PB N="68" REF="89">&s;hifted the &s;cene, and at once produced the bold and independent beauty, the intrepid female, the hoyden, the huntre&s;s, and the archer; the &s;winging arms, the confident addre&s;s, the regimental, and the four-in-hand. The&s;e &s;elf-complacent heroines made us ready to regret their &s;ofter predece&s;&s;ors, who had aimed only at plea&s;ing the other &s;ex, while the&s;e a&s;piring fair ones &s;truggled for the bolder renown of rivalling them. The project failed; for, whereas the former had &s;ued for admiration, the latter challenged, &s;eized, compelled it; but the men, as was natural, continued to prefer the more mode&s;t claimant to the &s;turdy competitor.</P>
<P>It were well if we, who have the advan|tage of contemplating the errors of the two extremes, were to look for truth where &s;he is commonly to be found, in the plain and obvious middle path, equally remote from each exce&s;s; and, while we bear in mind that helple&s;&s;ne&s;s is not delicacy, let us al&s;o remember that ma&s;culine manners
<PB N="69" REF="90">do not nece&s;&s;arily include &s;trength of character nor vigour of intellect. Should we not reflect al&s;o, that we are neither to train up Amazons nor Circa&s;&s;ians, but to form Chri&s;tians? that we have to educate not only rational but accountable beings? and, remembering this, &s;hould we not be &s;olicitous to let our daughters learn of the well-taught, and a&s;&s;ociate with the well-bred? In training them, &s;hould we not carefully cultivate intellect, implant religion, and cheri&s;h mode&s;ty? then, whatever is delicate in manners, would be the natural re&s;ult of whatever is ju&s;t in &s;entiment, and correct in principle: then, the decorums, the proprieties, theele|gancies, and even the graces, as far as they are &s;imple, pure, and hone&s;t, would follow as an almo&s;t inevitable con&s;equence; for to follow in the train of the Chri&s;tian virtues, and not to take the lead of them, is the proper place which religion a&s;&s;igns to the graces.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="91">
Whether we have made the be&s;t u&s;e of the errors of our predece&s;&s;ors, and of our own numberle&s;s advantages, and whether the prevailing &s;y&s;tem be really con&s;i&s;tent with &s;ound policy or with Chri&s;tian prin|ciple, it may be worth our while to inquire.</P>
<P>Would not a &s;tranger be led to imagine by a view of the reigning mode of female education, that human life con&s;i&s;ted of one univer&s;al holiday, and that the grand con|te&s;t between the &s;everal competitors was, who &s;hould be mo&s;t eminently qualified to excel, and carry off the prize, in the various &s;hows and games which were intended to be exhibited in it? And to the exhibitors them&s;elves, would he not be ready to apply Sir Francis Bacon's ob&s;ervation on the Olympian victors, that they were &s;o excellent in the&s;e unnece&s;&s;ary things, that their perfection mu&s;t needs have been acquired by the neglect of whatever was nece&s;&s;ary?</P>

What would the poli&s;hed Addi&s;on, who thought that one great end of a lady's learning to dance was, that &s;he might know how to &s;it &s;till gracefully; what would even the Pagan hi&s;torian <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sallu&s;t.</NOTE> of the great Roman con&s;pirator, who could commemorate it among the defects of his hero's <HI>accompli&s;hed</HI> mi&s;tre&s;s, <Q>that &s;he was too good a &s;inger and dancer for a virtuous woman;</Q> what would the&s;e refined critics have &s;aid, had they lived as we have done, to &s;ee the art of dancing lifted into &s;uch importance, that it cannot with any degree of &s;afety be confided to one in&s;tructor, but a whole train of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ma&s;ters are con&s;idered as ab&s;o|lutely e&s;&s;ential to its perfection? What would the&s;e accurate judges of female manners have &s;aid, to &s;ee a mode&s;t young lady fir&s;t delivered into the hands of a military &s;ergeant to in&s;truct her in the feminine art of marching? and when this

<P>The &s;cience of mu&s;ic, which u&s;ed to be communicated in &s;o competent a de|gree by one able in&s;tructor, is now di&s;tributed among a whole band. A young lady now requires, not a ma&s;ter, but an orche&s;tra. And my country readers would accu&s;e me of exaggeration were I to hazard enumerating the variety of mu&s;ical teachers who attend in the &s;ame family; the daugh|ters of which are &s;ummoned, by at lea&s;t as many in&s;truments as the &s;ubjects of Nebu|chadnezzar, to wor&s;hip the idol which

<P>Before the evil is pa&s;t redre&s;s, it will be prudent to reflect that in all poli&s;hed countries an entire devotedne&s;s to the fine arts has been one grand &s;ource of the cor|ruption of the women; and &s;o ju&s;tly were the&s;e pernicious con&s;equences appreciated by the Greeks, among whom the&s;e arts were carried to the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible per|fection, that they &s;eldom allowed them to
<PB N="74" REF="95">be cultivated to a very exqui&s;ite degree by women of great purity of character. And if the ambition of an elegant Briti&s;h lady &s;hould be fired by the idea that the accom|pli&s;hed females of tho&s;e poli&s;hed &s;tates were the admired companions of the philo|&s;ophers, the poets, the wits, and the arti&s;ts of Athens; and their beauty or talents the favourite &s;ubjects of the mu&s;e, the lyre, the pencil, and the chi&s;&s;el; &s;o that their pictures and &s;tatues furni&s;hed the mo&s;t con&s;ummate models of Grecian art: if, I &s;ay, the accompli&s;hed females of our days are panting for &s;imilar renown, let their mode&s;ty cha&s;ti&s;e their ambition, by re|collecting that the&s;e celebrated women are not to be found among the cha&s;te wives and the virtuous daughters of the Ari&s;tides's, the Agis's, and the Phocions; but that they are to be looked for among the Phrynes, the Lais's, the A&s;pa&s;ias, and the Glyceras. I am per&s;uaded the Chri&s;t|ian female, whatever be her talents, will renounce the de&s;ire of any celebrity when
<PB N="75" REF="96">attached to impurity of character, with the &s;ame noble indignation with which the virtuous biographer of the above-named heroes renounced all di&s;hone&s;t fame, by exclaiming, <Q>I had rather it &s;hould be &s;aid there never was a Plutarch, than that they &s;hould &s;ay Plutarch was ma|lignant, unju&s;t, or envious <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No cen&s;ure is levelled at the exertions of real genius, which is as valuable as it is rare; but at the ab&s;urdity of that &s;y&s;tem which is erecting <HI>the whole &s;ex</HI> into arti&s;ts.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>And while this corruption, brought on by an exce&s;&s;ive cultivation of the arts, has contributed its full &s;hare to the decline of &s;tates, it has always furni&s;hed an in|fallible &s;ymptom of their impending fall. The &s;atires of the mo&s;t penetrating and judicious of the Roman poets, corroborat|ing the te&s;timonies of the mo&s;t accurate of their hi&s;torians, abound with invectives again&s;t the depravity of manners intro|duced by the corrupt habits of female education. The bitterne&s;s and gro&s;s in|delicacy
<PB N="76" REF="97">of &s;ome of the&s;e &s;atiri&s;ts (too gro&s;s to be either quoted or referred to) make little again&s;t their authority in the&s;e points; for how &s;hocking mu&s;t tho&s;e cor|ruptions have been, and how obviou&s;ly offen&s;ive their cau&s;es, which could have appeared &s;o highly di&s;gu&s;ting to minds not likely to be &s;candalized by &s;light de|viations from decency!

It may however be ob&s;erved, that the mode&s;ty of the Roman matron, and the cha&s;te demeanor of her virgin daughters, which amid&s;t the &s;tern virtues of the &s;tate were as immaculate and pure as the honour of the Roman citizen, fell a &s;acri|fice to the luxurious di&s;&s;ipation brought in

The outward accompli&s;h|ments have the dangerous advantage of addre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves more immediately to the &s;en&s;es, and of cour&s;e, meet every where with tho&s;e who can in &s;ome mea|&s;ure appreciate as well as admire them; for all can &s;ee and hear, but all cannot &s;crutinize and di&s;criminate.

<P>Hired teachers are al&s;o under a di&s;ad|vantage re&s;embling tenants at rack-rent; it is their intere&s;t to bring in an immediate revenue of prai&s;e and profit, and, for the &s;ake of pre&s;ent rich crop, tho&s;e who are not &s;trictly con&s;cientious, do not care
<PB N="83" REF="104">how much the ground is impoveri&s;hed for future produce. But parents, who are the lords of the &s;oil, mu&s;t look to permanent value, and to continued fruitfulne&s;s. The be&s;t effects of a careful education are often very remote; they are to be di&s;covered in future &s;cenes, and exhibited in as yet untried connections. Every event of life will be putting the heart into fre&s;h &s;itu|ations, and making new demands on its prudence, its firmne&s;s, its integrity, or its forbearance. Tho&s;e who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to form and model it, cannot fore&s;ee tho&s;e contingent &s;ituations &s;pecifically and di&s;tinctly; yet, as far as human wi&s;dom will allow, they mu&s;t enable it to prepare for them all by general principles, correct habits, and an unremitted &s;en&s;e of depend|ence on the Great Di&s;po&s;er of events. The young Chri&s;tian militant mu&s;t learn and practi&s;e all his evolutions; though he does not know on what &s;ervice his leader may command him, by what particular

<P>But the contrary of all this is the ca&s;e with external acqui&s;itions. The ma&s;|ter, it is his intere&s;t, will indu&s;triou&s;ly in&s;truct his young pupil, to &s;et all her improvements in the mo&s;t immediate and con&s;picuous point of view. To allure and to &s;hine is the great principle &s;edulou&s;ly inculcated into her young heart; and is con&s;idered as the fundamental maxim; and, perhaps, if we were required to conden&s;e the reigning &s;y&s;tem of the brilliant education of a lady into an aphori&s;m, it might be com|pri&s;ed in this &s;hort &s;entence, <HI>To make the mo&s;t of her&s;elf.</HI> This &s;y&s;tem however is the fruit|ful germ, from which a thou&s;and yet unborn vanities, with all their multiplied ramifications will &s;pring. A tender mother cannot but feel an hone&s;t triumph in com|pleting tho&s;e talents in her daughter which will nece&s;&s;arily excite admiration; but &s;he will al&s;o &s;hudder at the vanity
<PB N="85" REF="106">that admiration may excite," and at the new ideas it will awaken; and, &s;tartling as it may &s;ound, the labours of a wi&s;e mother anxious for her daughter's be&s;t intere&s;ts, will &s;eem to be at variance with tho&s;e of all her teachers. She will indeed re|joice at her progre&s;s, but &s;he will rejoice with trembling; for &s;he is fully aware that if all po&s;&s;ible accompli&s;hments could be bought at the price of a &s;ingle virtue, of a &s;ingle principle, the purcha&s;e would be infinitely dear, and &s;he would reject the dazzling but de&s;tructive acqui&s;ition. She knows that the &s;uper&s;tructure of the ac|compli&s;hments can be alone &s;afely erected on the broad and &s;olid ba&s;is of Chri&s;tian humility: nay more, that as the materials of which that &s;uper&s;tructure is to be com|po&s;ed, are in them&s;elves of &s;o un&s;table and tottering a nature, the foundation mu&s;t be deepened, and enlarged with more abund|ant care, otherwi&s;e the fabric will be overloaded with its own ornaments, and

<P><Q>To every thing there is a &s;ea&s;on, and a time for every purpo&s;e under heaven,</Q> &s;aid the wi&s;e man; but he &s;aid it before the invention of baby-balls. This modern device is a &s;ort of triple con&s;piracy again&s;t the innocence, the health, and the happi|ne&s;s of children; thus, by factitious amu&s;e|ments, to rob them of a reli&s;h for the &s;imple joys, the unbought delights, which naturally belong to their blooming &s;ea&s;on, is like blotting out &s;pring from the year. To &s;acrifice the true and proper enjoy|ments of &s;prightly and happy children, is to make them pay a dear and di&s;pro|portionate price for their artificial plea&s;ures. They &s;tep at once from the nur&s;ery to the ball-room; and, by a prepo&s;terous change of habits, are thinking of dre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves, at an age when they u&s;ed to be dre&s;&s;ing their dolls. In&s;tead of bounding with the unre&s;trained freedom of little
<PB N="87" REF="108">wood-nymphs over hill and dale, their cheeks flu&s;hed with health, and their hearts overflowing with happine&s;s, the&s;e <HI>gay</HI> little creatures are &s;hut up all the morning, de|murely practi&s;ing the <HI>pas grave,</HI> and tran&s;|acting the &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s of acquiring a new &s;tep for the evening, with more co&s;t of time and pains than it would have taken them to acquire twenty new ideas.</P>
<P>Thus they lo&s;e the amu&s;ements which naturally belong to their &s;miling period, and unnaturally anticipate tho&s;e plea&s;ures (&s;uch as they are) which would come in, too much of cour&s;e, on their introduction into fa&s;hionable life. The true plea&s;ures of childhood are cheap and natural; for every object teems with delight to eyes and hearts new to the enjoyment of life; nay, the hearts of healthy children abound with a general di&s;po&s;ition to mirth and joy|fulne&s;s, even without a &s;pecific object to excite it; like our fir&s;t parent, in the

<Q><L>they live and move,</L>
<L>And feel that they are happier than they know.</L></Q>
Only furni&s;h them with a few &s;imple and harmle&s;s materials, and a little, but not too much, lei&s;ure, and they will manu|facture their own plea&s;ures with more &s;kill, and &s;ucce&s;s, and &s;atisfaction, than they will receive from all that your money can purcha&s;e. Their bodily recreations &s;hould be &s;uch as will promote their health, quicken their activity, enliven their &s;pirits, whet their ingenuity, and qualify them for their mental work. But, if you begin thus early to create wants, to invent grati|fications, to multiply de&s;ires, to waken dormant &s;en&s;ibilities, to &s;tir up hidden fires, you are &s;tudiou&s;ly laying up for your children a &s;tore of premature caprice and irritability, and di&s;content.</P>
<P>While childhood pre&s;erves its native &s;implicity, every little change is intere&s;ting,

Alas! that we &s;hould throw away this fir&s;t grand opportunity of working into a practical habit the moral of this important truth, that the chief &s;ource of human di&s;content is to be looked for, not in our real but in our factitious wants; not in the demands of nature, but in the artificial cravings of de&s;ire!</P>
<P>When one &s;ees the growing zeal to crowd the midnight ball with the&s;e pretty fairies, one would be almo&s;t tempted to fancy it was a kind of pious emulation among the mothers to cure their infants of a fondne&s;s for vain and fooli&s;h plea&s;ures, by tiring them out by this premature familiarity with them; and that they were actuated by &s;omething of the &s;ame prin|ciple, which led the Spartans to introduce their &s;ons to &s;cenes of riot, that they might
<PB N="90" REF="111">conceive an early di&s;gu&s;t at vice! or po&s;&s;ibly, that they imitated tho&s;e Scythian mothers who u&s;ed to plunge their new born infants into the flood, thinking none to be worth &s;aving who could not &s;tand this early &s;truggle for their lives: the greater part indeed, as it might have been expected, peri&s;hed; but the parents took comfort, that if many were lo&s;t, the few who e&s;caped would be the &s;tronger for having been thus expo&s;ed.</P>

<P>Under a ju&s;t impre&s;&s;ion of the evils which we are &s;u&s;taining from the prin|ciples and the practices of <HI>modern</HI> France, we are apt to lo&s;e &s;ight of tho&s;e deep and la&s;ting mi&s;chiefs which &s;o long, &s;o regularly, and &s;o &s;y&s;tematically, we have been importing from the &s;ame country, though in another form and under another government. In one re&s;pect, in|deed, the fir&s;t were the more formidable, becau&s;e we embraced the ruin without &s;u&s;|pecting it; while we defeat the malignity of the latter, by detecting the turpitude and defending our&s;elves again&s;t it. This is not the place to de&s;cant on that levity of manners, that contempt of the Sabbath, that fatal familiarity with loo&s;e principles, and tho&s;e relaxed notions of conjugal fidelity, which have often been tran&s;planted into this country by women of fa&s;hion,
<PB N="92" REF="113">as a too common effect of a long re&s;idence in that: but it is peculiarly &s;uitable to my &s;ubject to advert to another dome&s;tic mi&s;chief derived from the &s;ame foreign extraction: I mean, the ri&s;ks that have been run, and the &s;acrifices which have been made, in order to furni&s;h our young ladies with the means of acquiring the French language in the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible purity. Perfection in this accompli&s;hment has been &s;o long e&s;tabli&s;hed as the &s;upreme object; &s;o long con&s;idered as the pre|dominant excellence to which all other excellencies mu&s;t bow down, that it would be hopele&s;s to attack a law which fa&s;hion has immutably decreed, and which has received the &s;tamp of long pre&s;cription. We mu&s;t therefore be contented with ex|pre&s;&s;ing a wi&s;h, that this indi&s;pen&s;able per|fection could have been attained at the expence of &s;acrifices le&s;s important. It is with the greater regret I animadvert on this and &s;ome other prevailing practices, as they are errors into which the wi&s;e
<PB N="93" REF="114">and re&s;pectable have, through want of con&s;ideration, or rather through want of firmne&s;s to re&s;i&s;t the tyranny of fa&s;hion, &s;ometimes fallen. It has not been unu&s;ual when mothers of rank and reputation have been a&s;ked how they ventured to intru&s;t their daughters to foreigners, of who&s;e principles they know nothing, except that they were Roman Catholics, to an&s;wer, <Q>That they had taken care to be &s;ecure on that &s;ubject, for that it had been &s;tipulated that the que&s;tion of religion &s;hould never be agitated between the teacher and the pupil.</Q> This, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, is a mo&s;t de&s;perate remedy; it is like &s;tarving to death to avoid being poi&s;oned. And one cannot help trembling for the event of that education, from which religion, as far as the governe&s;s is concerned, is thus formally and &s;y&s;tem|atically excluded. Surely it would not be exacting too much to &s;ugge&s;t at lea&s;t that an attention no le&s;s &s;crupulous &s;hould be exerted to in&s;ure the character of our
<PB N="94" REF="115">children's in&s;tructor for piety and know|ledge, than is thought nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;certain that &s;he has nothing <HI>patois</HI> in her dialect.</P>
<P>I would rate a correct pronunciation and an elegant phra&s;eology at their ju&s;t price, and I would not rate them low; but I would not offer up principle as a victim to &s;ounds and accents. And the matter is now made more ea&s;y; for what|ever di&s;grace it might once have brought on an Engli&s;h lady to have had it &s;u&s;pected from her accent that &s;he had the misfor|tune, not to be born in a neighbouring country; &s;ome recent events may &s;erve to reconcile her to the &s;u&s;picion of having been bred in her own: a country, to which, (with all its faults, which are many!) the whole world is looking up with envy and admiration, as the &s;eat of true glory and of comparative happine&s;s: a country, in which the exile, driven out by the crimes of his own, finds a home! a country, to obtain the protection of which it was claim enough to be unfortunate; and no im|pediment
<PB N="95" REF="116">to have been the &s;ubject of her dire&s;t foe! a country, which in this re&s;pect, humbly imitating the Father of compa&s;&s;ion, when it offered mercy to a &s;uppliant enemy, never conditioned for merit, nor in&s;i&s;ted on the virtues of the mi&s;erable as a preliminary to its own bounty!</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>Compari&s;on of the mode of female education in the la&s;t age with the pre&s;ent.</HI></HEAD>
<P>To return, however, to the &s;ubject of general education. A young lady may excel in &s;peaking French and Italian, may repeat a few pa&s;&s;ages from a volume of extracts; play like a profe&s;&s;or, and &s;ing like a &s;yren; have her dre&s;&s;ing-room de|corated with her own drawings, tables, &s;tands, &s;creens, and cabinets; nay, &s;he may dance like Sempronia <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Cataline's Con&s;piracy.</NOTE> her&s;elf, and yet may have been very badly educated. I am far from meaning to &s;et no value whatever on any or all of the&s;e qualifi|cations; they are all of them elegant, and many of them properly tend to the per|fecting of a polite education. The&s;e things,
<PB N="97" REF="118">in their mea&s;ure and degree, may be done, but there are others which &s;hould not be left undone. Many things are becoming, but "one thing is needful." Be&s;ides, as the world &s;eems to be fully apprized of the value of whatever tends to embelli&s;h life, there is le&s;s occa&s;ion here to in&s;i&s;t on its importance.</P>
<P>But, though a well bred young lady may lawfully learn mo&s;t of the fa&s;hionable arts, yet it does not &s;eem to be the true end of education to make women of fa&s;hion <HI>dancers, &s;ingers, players, painters, actre&s;&s;es, &s;culptors, gilders, varni&s;hers, en|gravers,</HI> and <HI>embroiderers.</HI> Mo&s;t <HI>men</HI> are commonly de&s;tined to &s;ome profe&s;&s;ion, and their minds are con&s;equently turned each to its re&s;pective object. Would it not be &s;trange if they were called out to exerci&s;e their profe&s;&s;ion, or to &s;et up their trade, with only a little general knowledge of the trades of all other men, and with|out any previous definite application to their own peculiar calling? The pro|fe&s;&s;ion
<PB N="98" REF="119">of ladies, to which the bent of <HI>their</HI> in&s;truction &s;hould be turned, is that of daughters, wives, mothers, and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of families. They &s;hould be therefore trained with a view to the&s;e &s;everal condi|tions, and be furni&s;hed with a &s;tock of ideas and principles, and qualifications ready to be applied and appropriated, as occa&s;ion may demand, to each of the&s;e re&s;pective &s;ituations: for though the arts which merely embelli&s;h life mu&s;t claim ad|miration; yet when a man of &s;en&s;e comes to marry, it is a companion whom he wants, and not an arti&s;t. It is not merely a creature who can paint, and play, and dre&s;s, and dance; it is a being who can comfort and coun&s;el him; one who can rea&s;on and reflect, and feel, and judge, and di&s;cour&s;e, and di&s;criminate; one who can a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his affairs, lighten his cares, &s;ooth his &s;orrows, &s;trengthen his principles, and educate his children.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="120">
Almo&s;t any ornamental talent is a good thing, when it is not the be&s;t thing a woman has. And the writer of this page is intimately acquainted with &s;everal ladies who, excelling mo&s;t of their &s;ex in the art of mu&s;ic, but excelling them al&s;o in pru|dence and piety, find little lei&s;ure or temptation, amid&s;t the delights and duties of a large and lovely family, for the exerci&s;e of this talent, and regret that &s;o much of their own youth was wa&s;ted in acquiring an art which can be turned to &s;o little account in married life; and are now con&s;cientiou&s;ly re&s;tricting their daughters in the portion of time allotted to its acqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>Far be it from me to di&s;courage the cultivation of any exi&s;ting talent; but may it not be &s;ugge&s;ted to the fond believing mother, that talents, like the &s;pirit of Owen Glendower, though conjured with ever &s;o loud a voice,</P>
<P>Yet will not come when you do call for them.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="121">
That injudicious practice, therefore, cannot be too much di&s;couraged, of en|deavouring to create talents which do not exi&s;t in nature. <HI>That their daughters &s;hall learn every thing,</HI> is &s;o general a maternal maxim, that even unborn daugh|ters, of who&s;e expected abilities and con|jectured faculties, it is pre&s;umed, no very accurate judgment can previou&s;ly be formed, are yet prede&s;tined to this uni|ver&s;ality of accompli&s;hments. This com|prehen&s;ive maxim, thus almo&s;t univer&s;ally brought into practice, at once weakens the general powers of the mind, by draw|ing off its &s;trength into too great a variety of directions; and cuts up time into too many portions, by &s;plitting it into &s;uch an endle&s;s multiplicity of employments. I know that I am treading on tender ground; but I cannot help thinking that the re&s;tle&s;s pains we take to cram up every little vacuity of life, by crowding one new thing upon another, rather creates a thir&s;t for novelty than know|ledge;
<PB N="101" REF="122">and is but a well-di&s;gui&s;ed con|trivance to keep us in after-life more effectually from conver&s;ing with our&s;elves. The care taken to prevent <HI>ennui</HI> is but a creditable plan for promoting &s;elf-igno|rance. We run from one occupation to another (I &s;peak of tho&s;e arts to which little intellect is applied) with a view to lighten the pre&s;&s;ure of time; above all to &s;ave us from our own thoughts; whereas, were we thrown a little more on our own hands, we might at la&s;t be driven, by way of &s;omething to do, to try to get acquainted with our own hearts; and though our being le&s;s ab&s;orbed by this bu&s;y trifling and frivolous hurry, might render us &s;omewhat more &s;en&s;ible of the taedium of life, might not this very &s;en&s;ation tend to quicken our pur&s;uit of a better? For an awful thought here &s;ugge&s;ts it&s;elf. If life be &s;o long that we are driven to &s;et at work every engine to pa&s;s away the tediou&s;ne&s;s of time; how &s;hall we do to get rid of the tediou&s;|ne&s;s
<PB N="102" REF="123">of eternity? an eternity in which not one of the&s;e acqui&s;itions will be of the lea&s;t u&s;e. Let not then the &s;oul be &s;tarved by feeding it on the&s;e hu&s;ks, for it can be no more nouri&s;hed by them than the body can be fed with ideas and prin|ciples.</P>
<P>Among the boa&s;ted improvements of the pre&s;ent age, none affords more frequent matter of peculiar exultation, than the manife&s;t &s;uperiority in the employments of the young ladies of our time over tho&s;e of the good hou&s;ewives of the la&s;t century. The pre&s;ent are employed in learning the polite arts, or in acquiring liberal accom|pli&s;hments; while the others wore out their days in adorning the man&s;ion-hou&s;e with hangings of hideous tape&s;try and disfiguring tent-&s;titch. Mo&s;t chearfully do I allow to the reigning modes their boa&s;ted &s;uperiority; for certainly there is no piety in bad ta&s;te. Still, granting all the deformity of the exploded ornaments, one advantage attended them; the walls and
<PB N="103" REF="124">floors were not vain of their decorations; and it is to be feared, that the little per&s;on &s;ometimes is. The flattery be&s;towed on the old employments, for probably even <HI>they</HI> had their flatterers, furni&s;hed le&s;s aliment and le&s;s gratification to vanity, and was le&s;s likely to impair the delicacy of mode&s;ty, than the exqui&s;ite cultivation of <HI>per&s;onal</HI> accompli&s;hments or per&s;onal de|corations; and every mode which keeps down vanity and keeps back <HI>&s;elf,</HI> has at lea&s;t a moral u&s;e: and while one admires the elegant fingers of a young lady, bu&s;ied in working or painting her ball dre&s;s, one cannot help &s;u&s;pecting that her alacrity may be a little &s;timulated by the animating idea <HI>how very well &s;he &s;hall look in it.</HI> Might not this propen&s;ity be a little checked, and an intere&s;ting feeling com|bined with her indu&s;try, were the fair arti&s;t habituated to exerci&s;e her &s;kill in adorning &s;ome one el&s;e rather than her&s;elf? For it will add no lightne&s;s to the lighte&s;t head, nor vanity to the vaine&s;t heart, to take
<PB N="104" REF="125">plea&s;ure in reflecting how exceedingly the gown &s;he is working will become her mother. This &s;ugge&s;tion, trifling as it may &s;eem, of habituating young ladies to exerci&s;e their ta&s;te and devote their lei&s;ure, not to the decoration of their own per&s;ons, but to the &s;ervice of tho&s;e to whom they are bound by every tender tie, would not only help to repre&s;s vanity, but by thus a&s;&s;ociating the idea of indu&s;try with that of filial affection, would promote, while it gratified, &s;ome of the be&s;t affections of the heart. The Romans (and it is morti|fying, on the &s;ubject of Chri&s;tian edu|cation to be driven &s;o often to refer to the &s;uperiority of Pagans) were &s;o well aware of the importance of keeping up a &s;en&s;e of family fondne&s;s and attachment by the &s;ame means which promoted &s;imple and dome&s;tic employment, that no citizen of note ever appeared in public in any garb but what was &s;pun by his wife and daugh|ter; and this virtuous fa&s;hion was not confined to the days of republican &s;everity,
<PB N="105" REF="126">but even in all the pomp and luxury of imperial power, Augu&s;tus pre&s;erved this &s;implicity of manners.</P>
<P>Let me be allowed to repeat, that I mean not with prepo&s;terous prai&s;e to de&s;cant on the ignorance or the prejudices of pa&s;t times, nor ab&s;urdly to regret that vulgar &s;y&s;tem of education which rounded the little circle of female acquirements within the limits of the &s;ampler and the receipt book. Yet if a preference almo&s;t exclu&s;ive was then given to what was merely u&s;eful, a preference almo&s;t exclu&s;ive al&s;o is now a&s;&s;igned to what is merely ornamental. And it mu&s;t be owned, that if the life of a young lady, formerly, too much re&s;embled the life of a confectioner, it now too much re&s;embles that of an actre&s;s; the morning is all rehear&s;al, and the evening is all performance: and tho&s;e who are trained in this regular routine, who are in&s;tructed in order to be ex|hibited, &s;oon learn to feel a &s;ort of im|patience in tho&s;e &s;ocieties in which their
<PB N="106" REF="127">kind of talents are not likely to be brought into play: the ta&s;k of an auditor becomes dull to her, who has been u&s;ed to be a performer. And the exce&s;&s;ive com|mendation which the vi&s;itor is expected to pay for his entertainment, not only keeps alive the flame of vanity in the arti&s;t by con&s;tant fuel, but is not &s;eldom exacted at a price which a veracity at all &s;trict would grudge; but when a whole circle are obliged to be competitors who &s;hall flatter mo&s;t, it is not ea&s;y to be at once very &s;incere and very civil. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That accurate judge of the human heart, Madame de Maintenon, was &s;o well aware of the danger re&s;ulting from &s;ome kinds of excellence, that, after the young ladies of the Court of Louis Quatorze had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by the per|formance of &s;ome dramatic pieces of Racine, when her friends told her how admirably they had played their parts; "Yes," an&s;wered this wi&s;e woman, "&s;o admirably that they &s;hall never play again."</NOTE> And unluckily, while the age is become &s;o knowing and &s;o fa&s;tidious, that if a young lady does not
<PB N="107" REF="128">play like a public performer, no one thinks her worth attending to, yet if &s;he does &s;o excel, &s;ome of the &s;obere&s;t of the admiring circle feel a &s;trong alloy to their plea&s;ure, on reflecting at what a va&s;t expence of time this perfection mu&s;t pro|bably have been acquired.</P>
<P>May I venture, without being accu&s;ed of pedantry, to conclude this chapter with another reference to Pagan examples? The Hebrews, Egyptians, and Greeks, believed that they could more effectually teach their youth maxims of virtue, by calling in the aid of mu&s;ic and poetry; the&s;e maxims, therefore, they put into ver&s;es, and the&s;e again were &s;et to the mo&s;t popular and &s;imple tunes, which the children &s;ang; thus was their love of goodne&s;s excited by the very in&s;truments of their plea&s;ure; and the &s;en&s;es, the ta&s;te, and the imagination, as it were, pre&s;&s;ed into the &s;ervice of religion and morals. Dare I appeal to Chri&s;tian parents, if the&s;e arts are commonly u&s;ed by <HI>them,</HI> as &s;ub&s;i|diary
<PB N="108" REF="129">to religion and to a &s;y&s;tem of morals much more worthy of every ingenious aid and a&s;&s;ociation, which might tend to re|commend them to the youthful mind? Dare I appeal to Chri&s;tian parents, whether mu&s;ic, which fills up no trifling portion of their daughters' time, does not fill it without any moral end, or even &s;pecific object? whether &s;ome of the favourite &s;ongs of poli&s;hed &s;ocieties are not amatory, are not Anacreontic, more than quite become the mode&s;t lips of innocent youth and delicate beauty?</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> On the religious employment of time.&mdash;On the manner in which holidays are pa&s;&s;ed.&mdash; Selfi&s;hne&s;s and incon&s;ideration con&s;idered. &mdash;Dangers ari&s;ing from the world.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are many well di&s;po&s;ed parents who, while they attend to the&s;e fa&s;hionable acquirements, do not neglect to infu&s;e religious knowledge into the minds of their daughters; and having done this are but too apt to conclude that they have fully acquitted them&s;elves of the important duties of education. For having, as they think, &s;ufficiently grounded them in reli|gion, they do not &s;cruple to allow their daughters to &s;pend almo&s;t the whole of their time exactly like the daughters of worldly people. Now, though it be one great point gained, to have imbued
<PB N="110" REF="131">their young minds with the be&s;t know|ledge, the work is not therefore accom|pli&s;hed. "What do ye more than others?" is a que&s;tion, which in a more extended &s;en&s;e, religious parents mu&s;t be prepared to an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Such parents &s;hould go on to teach children the religious u&s;e of time, the duty of con&s;ecrating to God every talent, every faculty, every po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and of devoting their whole lives to his glory.</P>
<P>They &s;hould be more peculiarly on their guard again&s;t a &s;pirit of idlene&s;s, and a &s;lovenly habitual wa&s;ting of time, becau&s;e this practice, by not a&s;&s;uming a palpable &s;hape of guilt, carries little alarm to the con&s;cience. Even religious characters are in danger on this &s;ide; for not allow|ing them&s;elves to follow the world in its exce&s;&s;es and diver&s;ions, they have con|&s;equently more time upon their hands; and in&s;tead of dedicating the time &s;o re&s;cued to its true purpo&s;es, they &s;ometimes make as it were compen&s;ation to them&s;elves for
<PB N="111" REF="132">their ab&s;tinence from dangerous places of public re&s;ort, by an habitual frivolou&s;ne&s;s at home; by a &s;uperabundance of unprofitable &s;mall-talk, idle reading, and a quiet and dull frittering away of time. Their day perhaps has been more free from actual evil; but it will often be found to have been as un|productive as that of more worldly cha|racters; and they will be found to have traded to as little purpo&s;e with their ma&s;ter's talents. But a Chri&s;tian mu&s;t take care to keep his con&s;cience peculiarly alive to the unapparent, though formidable, perils of unprofitablene&s;s.</P>
<P>To the&s;e, and to all, the author would earne&s;tly recommend to accu&s;tom their children to pa&s;s at once from &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s to active and animated recreation; they &s;hould carefully pre&s;erve them from tho&s;e long and torpid intervals between both, that languid indolence and &s;piritle&s;s trifling, which wears out &s;uch large portions of life in both young and old. It has indeed pa&s;&s;ed into an aphori&s;m,
<PB N="112" REF="133">that activity is nece&s;&s;ary to virtue, even among tho&s;e who are not apprized that it is al&s;o indi&s;pen&s;able to happine&s;s. So far are many parents from being &s;en&s;ible of this truth, that vacations from &s;chool are not merely allowed, but appointed to pa&s;s away in weari&s;ome &s;auntering and inde|terminate idlene&s;s; and this by way of converting the holidays into plea&s;ure! Nay, the idlene&s;s is &s;pecifically made over to the child's mind, as the &s;tronge&s;t ex|pre&s;&s;ion of the fondne&s;s of the parent! A di&s;like to learning is thus &s;y&s;tematically excited by prepo&s;terou&s;ly erecting indo|lence into a reward for application!</P>
<P>The&s;e and &s;uch like errors of conduct ari&s;e from the latent but very operative principle of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s. This principle is obviou&s;ly promoted by many habits and practices &s;eemingly of little importance; and indeed &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s is &s;o commonly interwoven with vanity and incon&s;ideration, that I have not always though it nece&s;&s;ary to mark the di&s;tinction. They are alter|nately
<PB N="113" REF="134">cau&s;e and effect; and are produced and re-produced by reciprocal operation. Ill-judging tenderne&s;s is in fact only a concealed &s;elf-love, which cannot bear to be witne&s;s to the unea&s;ine&s;s which a pre&s;ent di&s;appointment, or difficulty, or vexation would cau&s;e to a darling child, yet does not &s;cruple by improper gratification to &s;tore up for it future mi&s;eries, which the child will infallibly &s;uffer, though it may be at a di&s;tant period which the mother will not perhaps behold.</P>
<P>Another principle &s;omething different from this, though it may properly fall under the head of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, &s;eems to actuate &s;ome parents in their conduct towards their children: I mean, a certain &s;lothfulne&s;s of mind, a love of ea&s;e, which impo&s;es a voluntary blindne&s;s, and makes them not choo&s;e to &s;ee what will give them trouble to combat. From &s;uch per&s;ons we frequently hear &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions as the&s;e: "Children will be children:" <Q>My children I &s;uppo&s;e are much like
<PB N="114" REF="135">tho&s;e of other people,</Q> &amp;c. Thus we may ob&s;erve this dangerous and delu&s;ive principle frequently turning off with a &s;mile from the fir&s;t indications of tho&s;e tempers, which from their fatal tendency ought to be very &s;eriou&s;ly taken up. I would be under&s;tood now as &s;peaking to con&s;cientious parents, who con&s;ider it as a duty to correct the faults of their children, but who from this indolence of mind, are extremely backward in <HI>di&s;covering</HI> &s;uch faults, and not very well plea&s;ed when they are pointed out by others. Such parents will do well to take notice that whatever they con&s;ider it as a duty to <HI>correct,</HI> mu&s;t be equally a duty to en|deavour to <HI>find out.</HI> And this love of ca&s;e is the more to be guarded again&s;t, as it not only leads parents into erroneous conduct towards their children, but is peculiarly dangerous to them&s;elves. It is a fault frequently cheri&s;hed from igno|rance of its real character; for, not bearing on it the &s;trong features of de|formity
<PB N="115" REF="136">which mark many other vices, but on the contrary bearing &s;ome re|&s;emblance to virtue, it is frequently mi&s;taken for the Chri&s;tian graces of patience, meekne&s;s, and forbearance, than which nothing can be more oppo&s;ite; the&s;e proceeding from the Chri&s;tian prin|ciple of &s;elf-denial, the other from &s;elf-indulgence.</P>
<P>In this connection may I be permitted to remark on the practice at the tables of many families, when the children are at home for the holidays; every delicacy is forced upon them, with the tempting remark, "that they cannot have this "or that dainty at &s;chool;" and they are indulged in irregular hours from the &s;ame motive, "becau&s;e they cannot have that "indulgence at &s;chool." Thus the na|tural &s;eeds of idlene&s;s, &s;en&s;uality, and &s;loth, are at once cheri&s;hed, by converting the periodical vi&s;it at home into a &s;ea&s;on of intemperance, late hours, and exemption from &s;tudy; &s;o that children are ha|bituated,
<PB N="116" REF="137">at an age when la&s;ting a&s;&s;ociations are formed in the mind, to connect the idea of &s;tudy with that of hard&s;hip, of happine&s;s with gluttony, and of plea&s;ure with loitering, fea&s;ting, or &s;leeping. Would it not be better to make them combine the delightful idea of home, with the gratification of the &s;ocial affections, the fondne&s;s of maternal love, the kindne&s;s and confidence of the &s;weet dome&s;tic at|tachments,</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;And all the charities</L>
<L>Of father, &s;on, and brother?</L></Q>
<P>I will venture to &s;ay, that tho&s;e li&s;tle&s;s and vacant days, when the thoughts have no preci&s;e object; when indu&s;try has no definite pur&s;uit; when the mind and the body have no exerci&s;e, and the ingenuity no acqui&s;ition either to anticipate or to enjoy, are the longe&s;t, the dulle&s;t, and the lea&s;t happy, which children of &s;pirit and genius ever pa&s;s. Yes! it is a few &s;hort but lively intervals of animated plea&s;ure,
<PB N="117" REF="138">&s;natched from between the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive labours and duties of a bu&s;y day, looked forward to with hope, enjoyed with ta&s;te, and recollected without remor&s;e, which, both to men and to children, yield the true&s;t to men and to children, yield the true&s;t portions of enjoyment. O &s;natch your offspring from adding to the number of tho&s;e objects of &s;upreme commi&s;eration, who &s;eek their happine&s;s in doing nothing! Life is but a &s;hort day; but it is a work|ing day. Activity <HI>may</HI> lead to evil; but inactivity <HI>cannot</HI> be led to good.</P>
<P>Young ladies &s;hould al&s;o be accu&s;tomed to &s;et apart a fixed portion of their time as &s;acred to the poor <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It would be a noble employment and well becoming the tenderne&s;s of their &s;ex, if ladies were to con&s;ider the &s;uperintendance of the poor as their immediate office. They are peculiarly fitted for it; for from their own habits of life they are more intimately acquainted with dome&s;tic wants than the other &s;ex; and, in certain in&s;tances of &s;ickne&s;s and &s;uffering peculiar to them&s;elves, they &s;hould be expected to have more &s;ympathy; and they have obviou&s;ly more lei&s;ure. There is a certain religious &s;ociety, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the &s;implicity of their dre&s;s, manners, and language, who&s;e poor are perhaps better taken care of than any other; and one rea&s;on may be, that they are immediately under the in|&s;pection of the women.</NOTE>, whether in re|lieving,
<PB N="118" REF="139">in&s;tructing, or working for them; and the performance of this duty mu&s;t not be left to the event of contingent circum&s;tances, or the operation of acci|dental impre&s;&s;ions; but it mu&s;t be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed into a principle, and wrought into a habit. A &s;pecific portion of time mu&s;t be allotted to it, on which no common engagement mu&s;t be allowed to intrench. This will help to furni&s;h a powerful remedy for that &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s who&s;e &s;trong holds, the truth cannot be too often repeated, it is the grand bu&s;ine&s;s of Chri&s;tian education perpetually to attack. If we were but aware how much better it makes our&s;elves to wi&s;h to &s;ee others better, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t in making them &s;o,
<PB N="119" REF="140">we &s;hould find that the good done would be of as much importance by the habit it would induce in our own minds, as by its beneficial effects on others <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In addition to the in&s;truction of the individual poor, and the &s;uperintendance of charity &s;chools, ladies might be highly u&s;eful in a&s;&s;i&s;ting the pa|rochial clergy in the adoption of that excellent plan for the in&s;truction of the ignorant, &s;ugge&s;ted by the Bi&s;hop of Durham in his la&s;t admirable charge to his clergy. It is with plea&s;ure the author is enabled to add that the &s;cheme has actually been adopted with good effect in that exten&s;ive dioce&s;e.</NOTE></P>
<P>It will be requiring of children a very &s;mall &s;acrifice, if you teach them merely to give that money to the poor which belongs to the parent; this &s;ort of charity commonly &s;ubtracts little from their own plea&s;ures, e&s;pecially when what they have be&s;towed is immediately made up to them, as a reward for their little fit of gene|ro&s;ity. They will on this plan, &s;oon learn to give not only for prai&s;e but for profit. The &s;acrifice of an orange to a little
<PB N="120" REF="141">girl, or a feather to a great one, given at the expence of their own gratification, would be a better le&s;&s;on of charity on its right ground, than a con&s;iderable &s;um of money, to be pre&s;ently replaced by the parent. And it would be habituating them early to combine two ideas which ought never to be &s;eparated, charity and &s;elf-denial.</P>
<P>As an antidote to &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s as well as pride and indolence, they &s;hould al&s;o very early be taught to perform all the little offices in their power for them&s;elves; not to be in&s;olently calling for &s;ervants where there is no real occa&s;ion; above all, they &s;hould be accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider the dome&s;tics' hours of meals as almo&s;t &s;acred, and the golden rule &s;hould be practically and uniformly inforced, even on &s;o trifling an occa&s;ion as ringing a bell, through mere wantonne&s;s, or &s;elf-love, or pride.</P>
<P>To check the growth of incon&s;iderate|ne&s;s, young ladies &s;hould early be taught
<PB N="121" REF="142">to di&s;charge their little debts with punc|tuality. They &s;hould be made &s;en&s;ible of the cruelty of obliging trades-people to call often for the money due to them; and of hindering and detaining tho&s;e who&s;e time is the &s;ource of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, under pretence of &s;ome frivolous engage|ment, which ought to be made to bend to the comfort and advantage of others. They &s;hould con&s;cientiou&s;ly allow &s;ufficient time for the execution of their orders; and with a Chri&s;tian circum&s;pection, be careful not to drive work-people by need|le&s;s hurry, into lo&s;ing their re&s;t, or break|ing the Sabbath. I have known a lady give her gown to a mantua-maker on the Saturday night, to whom &s;he would not for the world &s;ay in &s;o many words, "You mu&s;t work through the whole "of Sunday," while &s;he was virtually compelling her to do &s;o, by an injunction to bring the gown home fini&s;hed on the Monday morning, on pain of her di&s;|plea&s;ure. To the&s;e hard&s;hips numbers
<PB N="122" REF="143">are continually driven by good-natured but incon&s;iderate employers. As the&s;e petty exactions of incon&s;ideration furni&s;h al&s;o a con&s;tant aliment to &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, let not a de&s;ire to counteract them be con|&s;idered as leading to too minute details; nothing is too frivolous for animadver&s;ion, which tends to fix a bad habit in the &s;uperior, or to wound the feelings of the dependant.</P>
<P>Would it not be turning tho&s;e political doctrines, which are now &s;o warmly agitating, to a truly moral account, and give the be&s;t practical an&s;wer to the popular declamations on the inequality of human conditions; were the rich care|fully to in&s;truct their children to &s;often that inevitable inequality by the mildne&s;s and tenderne&s;s of their behaviour to their inferiors? This di&s;pen&s;ation of God, which excites &s;o many murmurs, would, were it thus practically improved, tend to e&s;tabli&s;h the glory of that Being who is now &s;o often reviled for his inju&s;tice; for God
<PB N="123" REF="144">him&s;elf is covertly attacked in many of the invectives again&s;t laws and governments.</P>
<P>This di&s;pen&s;ation thus properly im|proved, would at once call into exerci&s;e the genero&s;ity, kindne&s;s, and forbearance of the &s;uperior; and the patience, re&s;ign|ation, and gratitude of the inferior; and thus, while we were vindicating the <HI>ways</HI> of Providence, we &s;hould be accompli&s;hing his <HI>plan,</HI> by bringing into action tho&s;e virtues of both cla&s;&s;es which would have had little exerci&s;e had there been no di&s;proportion in ranks. Tho&s;e who are &s;o zealou&s;ly contending for the privileges of rank and power, &s;hould never lo&s;e &s;ight of the religious duties and con&s;iderate virtues which the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e impo&s;es on them&s;elves; duties and virtues which &s;hould ever be in&s;eparable from tho&s;e privileges. As the inferior cla&s;&s;es have little real right to complain of <HI>laws,</HI> in this re&s;pect let the great be watchful to give them as little cau&s;e to complain of <HI>manners;</HI> by carefully training up their
<PB N="124" REF="145">children to &s;upply by individual kindne&s;s tho&s;e ca&s;es which laws cannot reach: by &s;uch means every le&s;&s;on of politics may be converted into a le&s;&s;on of piety; and a &s;pirit of love might win over &s;ome whom a &s;pirit of invective will only in|flame.</P>
<P>It can never be too often repeated, that one of the great objects of education is the forming of habits. Among the in&s;tances of negligence into which even religiou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed parents and teachers are apt to fall, one is, that they are not &s;ufficiently attentive in finding intere&s;ting employment for the Sunday. They do not make a &s;cruple of &s;ometimes allowing their children to fill up the intervals of public wor&s;hip with their ordinary em|ployments and common &s;chool exerci&s;es. They are not aware that they are thus training their offspring to an early and a &s;y&s;tematic profanation of the Sabbath by this habit; for to children their ta&s;ks are their bu&s;ine&s;s: to them a French
<PB N="125" REF="146">or Latin exerci&s;e is as &s;erious an occu|pation as the exerci&s;e of a trade or profe&s;&s;ion is to a man; and if they are allowed to think the one right <HI>now,</HI> they will not be brought hereafter to think that the other is wrong; for the opinions and habits fixed at this early &s;ea&s;on are not ea&s;ily altered. By this over&s;ight even the friends of religion may be contributing eventually to that abolition of the Sabbath, &s;o devoutly wi&s;hed by its enemies, as the de&s;ired preliminary to the de&s;truction of whatever is mo&s;t dear to Chri&s;tians. What ob&s;truction would it offer to the general progre&s;s of youth, if all their Sunday exerci&s;es (which, with reading, compo&s;ing, tran&s;cribing, and getting by heart, might be extended to an entertaining variety) were adapted to the peculiar nature of the day. It is not meant to impo&s;e on them &s;uch rigorous &s;tudy as &s;hall convert the day they &s;hould be taught to love, into a day of burdens and hard&s;hips, or to abridge their innocent enjoyments; but
<PB N="126" REF="147">it is intended merely to &s;ugge&s;t that there &s;hould be a marked di&s;tinction in the nature of their employments and &s;tudies; for on the ob&s;ervance or neglect of this, as was before ob&s;erved, their future notions and principles will in a good degree be formed. The go&s;pel in re&s;cuing the Lord's day from the rigorous bondage of the Jewi&s;h Sabbath, never le&s;&s;ened the obligation to keep it holy, nor meant to &s;anction any &s;ecular occupation.</P>
<P>Though the author, chiefly writing with a view to dome&s;tic in&s;truction, has pur|po&s;ely avoided entering on the di&s;puted que&s;tion, whether a &s;chool or home educa|tion be be&s;t; a que&s;tion which perhaps mu&s;t generally be decided by the &s;tate of the individual home, and the &s;tate of the indivdual &s;chool; yet &s;he begs leave to &s;ugge&s;t one remark, which peculiarly belongs to a &s;chool education; namely, the general habit of converting the Sunday into a vi&s;iting day by way of gaining time; as if the appropriate in&s;tructions of the
<PB N="127" REF="148">Sunday were the cheape&s;t &s;acrifice which could be made to plea&s;ure. Even in tho&s;e &s;chools, in which religion is con&s;idered as an indi&s;pen&s;able part of in&s;truction, this kind of in&s;truction is almo&s;t exclu&s;ively limited to Sundays: how then are girls ever to make any progre&s;s in this mo&s;t important article, if they are habituated to lo&s;e the religious advantages of the &s;chool, for the &s;ake of having more dainties for dinner abroad? This remark cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to apply to the vi&s;its which children make to religious parents, and indeed it only applies to tho&s;e ca&s;es where the &s;chool is a con&s;cientious &s;chool, and the vi&s;it a trifling vi&s;it.</P>
<P>Among other &s;ubjects which engro&s;s a good &s;hare of worldly conver&s;ation, one of the mo&s;t attracting is beauty. Many ladies have often a random way of talking rapturou&s;ly on the general importance of beauty, who are yet prudent enough to be very unwilling to let their own daughters find out they are hand&s;ome.
<PB N="128" REF="149">Perhaps the contrary cour&s;e might be &s;afer. If the little li&s;tener were not con&s;tantly hearing that beauty is the be&s;t gift, &s;he would not be &s;o vain from fancying her&s;elf to be the be&s;t gifted. Be le&s;s &s;olicitous therefore to conceal from her a &s;ecret which with all your watchfulne&s;s &s;he will be &s;ure to find out, without your telling; but rather &s;eek to lower the general value of beauty in her e&s;timation. U&s;e your daughter in all things to a different &s;tandard from that of the world. It is not by vulgar people and &s;ervants only that &s;he will be told of her being pretty. She will be hearing it not only from gay ladies, but from grave men; &s;he will be hearing it from the world around her. The antidote to the pre&s;ent danger is not now to be &s;earched for; it mu&s;t be already operating. It mu&s;t have been provided for in the foundation laid in the general principle &s;he had been imbib|ing, before this particular temptation of beauty came in que&s;tion. And this general

<P>AMONG the real improvements of modern times, and they are not a few, it is to be feared that the growth of filial obedience cannot be included. Who can forbear ob&s;erving and regretting in a variety of in&s;tances, that not only &s;ons but daughters have adopted &s;omething of that &s;pirit of in|dependence, and di&s;dain of control, which characteri&s;e the times? And is it not obvious that dome&s;tic manners are not
<PB N="135" REF="156">&s;lightly tinctured with the hue of public principles? The <HI>rights of man</HI> have been di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, till we are &s;omewhat wearied with the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. To the&s;e have been oppo&s;ed with more pre&s;umption than prudence <HI>the rights of woman.</HI> It follows according to the natural progre&s;&s;ion of human things, that the next &s;tage of that irradiation which our enlighteners are pouring in upon us as will produce grave de&s;cants on the <HI>rights of children.</HI></P>
<P>This revolutionary &s;pirit in families &s;ugge&s;ts the remark that among the faults with which it has been too much the fa&s;hion of recent times to load the memory of the incomparable Milton, one of the charges brought again&s;t his private cha|racter (for with his political character we have here nothing to do) has been, that he was &s;o &s;evere a father as to have compelled his daughters, after he was blind, to read aloud to him for his &s;ole plea&s;ure Greek and Latin authors of which they did not under&s;tand a word. But this is in fact
<PB N="136" REF="157">nothing more than an in&s;tance of the &s;trict dome&s;tic regulations of the age in which Milton lived; and &s;hould not be brought forward as a proof of the &s;everity of his individual temper. Nor indeed in any ca&s;e &s;hould it ever be con&s;idered as an hard&s;hip for an affectionate child to amu&s;e an afflicted parent, though it &s;hould be attended with a heavier &s;acrifice of her own plea&s;ure than in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In &s;pite of this too prevailing &s;pirit, numberle&s;s in&s;tances might be adduced of filial affection truly honourable to the pre&s;ent period. And the author records with plea&s;ure, that &s;he has &s;een amiable young ladies of high rank conducting the &s;teps of a blind but illu&s;trious parent, with true filial fondne&s;s; and has often contemplated in another family, the intere&s;t|ing attentions of daughters who were both hands and eyes to an infirm and nearly blind father. It is but ju&s;tice to add, that the&s;e examples are not taken from that middle rank of life which Milton filled, but from the daughters of the highe&s;t officers in the &s;tate.</NOTE></P>
<P>Is the author then inculcating the har&s;h doctrine of parental au&s;terity? By no
<PB N="137" REF="158">means. It drives the gentle &s;pirit to artifice, and the rugged to de&s;pair. It generates deceit and cunning, the mo&s;t hopele&s;s and hateful in the whole cata|logue of female failings. Ungoverned anger in the teacher, and inability to di&s;criminate between venial errors and premeditated offence, though they may lead a timid creature to hide wrong tem|pers, or to conceal bad actions, will not help her to &s;ubdue the one or correct the other. Severity will drive terrified children to &s;eek, not for reformation, but for impunity. A readine&s;s to forgive them promotes frankne&s;s. And we &s;hould, above all things, encourage them to be frank in order to come at their faults. They have not more faults for being open, they only <HI>di&s;cover</HI> more.</P>
<P>Di&s;cipline, however, is not cruelty, and re&s;traint is not &s;everity. We mu&s;t &s;trengthen the feeble while we repel the bold. The cultivator of the human mind mu&s;t, like the gardener, &s;tudy diver&s;ities
<PB N="138" REF="159">of &s;oil. The &s;kilful labourer knows that even where the &s;urface is not particularly promi&s;ing, there is often a rough &s;trong ground which will amply repay the trouble of breaking it up; and we are often mo&s;t taken with a &s;oft &s;urface, though it conceal a &s;hallow depth, becau&s;e it promi&s;es pre&s;ent reward and little trouble. But &s;trong and pertinacious tempers, of which perhaps ob&s;tinacy is the leading vice, under &s;kilful management often turn out &s;teady and &s;terling characters; while from &s;ofter clay a firm and vigorous virtue is but &s;eldom produced.</P>
<P>But the&s;e revolutions in character can|not be effected by mere education. Plutarch has ob&s;erved that the medical &s;cience would never be brought to per|fection till poi&s;ons &s;hould be converted into phy&s;ic. What our late improvers in natural &s;cience have done in the medical world, by converting the mo&s;t deadly ingredients into in&s;truments of life and health, Chri&s;tianity with a &s;ort of divine
<PB N="139" REF="160">Alchymy has effected in the moral world, by that tran&s;mutation which makes tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which have been working for &s;in become active in the cau&s;e of religion. The violent temper of Saul of Tar&s;us which was "exceedingly mad" again&s;t the &s;aints of God, did God &s;ee fit to convert into that burning zeal which enabled Paul the Apo&s;tle to labour &s;o unremittingly for the conver&s;ion of the Gentile world. Chri&s;tianity indeed does not &s;o much give us new affections or faculties, as give a new direction to tho&s;e we already have. She changes that &s;orrow of the world which worketh death, into <Q>godly &s;orrow which worketh repentance.</Q> She changes our anger again&s;t the per&s;ons we di&s;like, into hatred of their &s;ins. <Q>The fear of man which worketh a &s;nare,</Q> &s;he tran&s;mutes into "that fear of God "which worketh &s;alvation. That religion does not extingui&s;h the pa&s;&s;ions but correct them, the animated expre&s;&s;ions of the fervid Apo&s;tle confirms&mdash; <Q>Yea, what
<PB N="140" REF="161"><HI>fearfulne&s;s;</HI> yea, what <HI>clearing of your|&s;elves;</HI> yea, what <HI>indignation;</HI> yea, what <HI>fear;</HI> yea, what <HI>vehement de&s;ire;</HI> yea, what <HI>zeal;</HI> yea, what <HI>revenge</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Corinthians, vii, II.</NOTE><HI>!</HI></Q></P>
<P>Thus, by &s;ome of the mo&s;t trouble&s;ome pa&s;&s;ions of our nature being converted by the ble&s;&s;ing of God on a religious education to the &s;ide of virtue, a double purpo&s;e is effected. Becau&s;e, if I may be allowed to change the metaphor, it is the character of the pa&s;&s;ions never to ob&s;erve a neutrality. If they are no longer rebels, they become auxiliaries; and a foe &s;ub|dued is an ally obtained. And it is the effect of religion on the pa&s;&s;ions, that when &s;he &s;eizes the enemy's garri&s;on, &s;he does not de&s;troy the works, &s;he does not burn the ar&s;enal and &s;pike the cannon; but the artillery &s;he &s;eizes, &s;he turns to her own u&s;e, and plants its whole force again&s;t the enemy from whom &s;he has taken it.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="162">
But while I would deprecate har&s;hne&s;s, I would inforce di&s;cipline; and that not merely on the ground of religion, but of happine&s;s al&s;o. One rea&s;on not &s;eldom brought forward by tender but mi&s;taken mothers, as an apology for their un|bounded indulgence, e&s;pecially to weakly children, is, that they probably will not live to enjoy the world when grown up, and that therefore they will not abridge the little plea&s;ure they may enjoy at pre|&s;ent. But a &s;light degree of ob&s;ervation would prove that this is an error in judg|ment as well as in principle. For, omit|ting any con&s;iderations re&s;pecting their future welfare, and entering only into their immediate intere&s;ts; it is an indi&s;putable fact that children who know no control, who&s;e faults encounter no contradiction, and who&s;e humours experience con&s;tant indulgence, grow more irritable and ca|pricious, invent wants, create de&s;ires, lo&s;e all reli&s;h for the plea&s;ures which they know they may reckon upon; and become
<PB N="142" REF="163">perhaps more mi&s;erable than even tho&s;e children who labour under the more obvious and more commi&s;erated misfor|tune of &s;uffering under the tyranny of unkind parents.</P>
<P>An early habitual re&s;traint is peculiarly important to the future character and happine&s;s of women. They &s;hould when very young be inured to contradiction. In&s;tead of hearing their bon-mots trea&s;ured up and repeated to the gue&s;ts till they begin to think it dull, when they them|&s;elves are not the little heroine of the theme, they &s;hould be accu&s;tomed to receive but little prai&s;e for their vivacity or their wit, though they &s;hould receive ju&s;t commendation for their patience, their indu&s;try, their humility, and other qualities which have more worth than &s;plendour. They &s;hould be led to di&s;tru&s;t their own judgment; they &s;hould learn not to mur|mur at expo&s;tulation; but &s;hould be accu&s;tomed to expect and to endure oppo|&s;ition. It is a le&s;&s;on with which the world
<PB N="143" REF="164">will not fail to furni&s;h them; and they will not practi&s;e it the wor&s;e for having learnt it the &s;ooner. It is of the la&s;t importance to their happine&s;s in life that they &s;hould early acquire a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive temper and a forbearing &s;pirit. They mu&s;t even endure to be thought wrong &s;ometimes, when they cannot but feel they are right. And while they &s;hould be anxiou&s;ly a&s;piring to do well, they mu&s;t not expect always to obtain the prai&s;e of having done &s;o. But while a gentle demeanor is inculcated, let them not be in&s;tructed to practi&s;e gentlene&s;s merely on the low ground of its being decorous and feminine, and plea&s;ing, and calculated to attract human favour; but let them be carefully taught to cultivate it on the high principle of obedience to Chri&s;t; on the practical ground of labouring after con|formity to HIM, who, when he propo&s;ed him&s;elf as a perfect pattern of imitation, did not &s;ay, learn of me for I am great, or wi&s;e, or mighty, but <Q>learn of me for I
<PB N="144" REF="165">am meek and lowly,</Q> and graciou&s;ly promi&s;ed that the reward &s;hould accom|pany the practice, by encouragingly adding, "and ye &s;hall find re&s;t to your &s;ouls." Do not teach them humility on the ordi|nary ground that vanity is <HI>unamiable,</HI> and that no one will <HI>love</HI> them if they are proud; for that will only go to correct the exterior and make them &s;oft and &s;miling hypocrites. But inform them that <Q>God re&s;i&s;teth the proud,</Q> while <Q>them that are meek he &s;hall guide in judg|ment, and &s;uch as are gentle them &s;hall he teach his way.</Q> In the&s;e, as in all other ca&s;es, an habitual attention to the <HI>motives</HI> &s;hould be carefully &s;ub&s;tituted in their young hearts, in the place of too much anxiety about the <HI>event</HI> of actions, and too much &s;olicitude for that human prai&s;e which attaches to appearances as much as to realities; to &s;ucce&s;s more than to de&s;ert.</P>
<P>There is a cu&s;tom among teachers, which is not the more right for being
<PB N="145" REF="166">common; they are apt to be&s;tow an undue proportion of pains on children of the be&s;t capacity, as if only geniu&s;es were worthy of attention. They &s;hould reflect that in moderate talents carefully cultivated, we are perhaps to look for the chief happine&s;s and virtue of &s;ociety. If &s;uperlative genius had been generally nece&s;&s;ary, its exi&s;tence would not have been &s;o rare; for Omnipotence could have made tho&s;e talents common which we now con&s;ider as extraordinary. Be&s;ides, while we are con&s;cientiou&s;ly in&s;tructing children of moderate capacity, it is a comfort to reflect that if no labour will rai&s;e them to a high degree in the &s;cale of intellectual excellence, yet they may be led on to perfection in that road in which <Q>a way-faring man though &s;imple &s;hall not err.</Q> And when a mother feels di&s;po&s;ed to repine that her family is not likely to exhibit a groupe of future wits and growing beauties, let her con&s;ole her|&s;elf by looking abroad into the world,
<PB N="146" REF="167">where &s;he will quickly perceive that the monopoly of happine&s;s is not engro&s;&s;ed by beauty, nor that of virtue by genius.</P>
<P>A girl who has docility will &s;eldom be found to want under&s;tanding &s;ufficient for all the purpo&s;es of a u&s;eful, a happy, and a pious life. And it is as wrong for parents to &s;et out with too &s;anguine a dependance on the figure their children are to make in life, as it is unrea&s;onable to be di&s;couraged at every di&s;appointment. Want of &s;ucce&s;s is &s;o far from furni&s;hing a motive for relaxing their energy, that it is a rea&s;on for redoubling it. Let them &s;u&s;pect their own plans, and reform them; let them di&s;tru&s;t their own principles, and correct them. The generality of parents do too little; &s;ome do much and mi&s;s their reward, becau&s;e they look not to any &s;trength beyond their own: after much is done, much will remain undone; for the entire regulation of the heart and affections is not the work of education alone, but the operation of divine grace. Will it be
<PB N="147" REF="168">accounted enthu&s;ia&s;m to &s;ugge&s;t <Q>that the fervent effectual prayer of a righteous <HI>parent</HI> availeth much?</Q> and perhaps the rea&s;on why &s;o many anxious mothers fail of &s;ucce&s;s is, becau&s;e they repo&s;e with confidence in their own &s;kill and labour, without looking to HIM with|out who&s;e ble&s;&s;ing they do but labour in vain.</P>
<P>On the other hand, is it not to be feared that &s;ome pious parents have fallen into an error of an oppo&s;ite kind? From a full conviction that human endeavours are vain, and that it is God alone who can change the heart, they are earne&s;t in their prayers, but not &s;o earne&s;t in their endeavours. Such parents &s;hould be re|minded, that if they do not add their exertions to their prayers, their children are not likely to be more benefited than the children of tho&s;e who do not add their prayers to their exertions. What God has joined let not man pre&s;ume to &s;eparate. It <HI>is</HI> the work of God, we readily acknow|ledge,
<PB N="148" REF="169">to implant religion in the heart, and to maintain it there as a ruling prin|ciple of conduct. And is it not the &s;ame God which cau&s;es the corn to grow? Are not our natural lives con&s;tantly pre|&s;erved by his power? Who will deny that in Him we live and move and have our being? But how are the&s;e works of God carried on? By <HI>means</HI> which he has appointed. By the labour of the hu&s;bandman the corn is made to grow. By food the body is &s;u&s;tained: and by religious in&s;truction God is plea&s;ed to work upon the human heart. As far as <HI>we</HI> &s;ee of the ways of God, all his works are carried on by <HI>means.</HI> It becomes there|fore our duty to u&s;e the means and tru&s;t in God; to remember that God will not work without the means; and that the means can effect nothing without his ble&s;&s;ing. <Q>Paul may plant and Apollos water, but it is God mu&s;t give the increa&s;e</Q>. But to what does he give the increa&s;e? To the <HI>exertions</HI> of Paul
<PB N="149" REF="170">and Apollos. It is never &s;aid that becau&s;e God only can give the increa&s;e, that Paul and Apollos may &s;pare their labour.</P>
<P>It is one grand object to give the young probationer ju&s;t and &s;ober views of the world on which &s;he is about to enter.

Teach her that this world is not
<PB N="150" REF="171">a &s;tage for the di&s;play of &s;uperficial talents, but for the &s;trict and &s;ober exercife of for|titude, temperance, meekne&s;s, faith, dili|gence, and &s;elf-denial; of her due per|formance of which Chri&s;tian graces, Angels will be &s;pectators, and God the judge. Teach her that human life is not a &s;plendid romance, &s;pangled over with brilliant adventures, and enriched with extraordinary occurrences, and diver&s;ified with wonderful incidents; lead her not to expect that life will abound with &s;cenes which will call &s;hining qualities and great powers into perpetual action; and for which if &s;he acquit her&s;elf well &s;he will be rewarded with proportionate fame and certain commendation. But apprize her that human life is a true hi&s;tory, many pa&s;&s;ages of which will be dull, ob&s;cure, and unintere&s;ting; &s;ome perhaps tragical; but that whatever gay incidents and plea&s;|ing &s;cenes may be inter&s;per&s;ed in the progre&s;s of the piece, yet finally <Q>one event happeneth to all;</Q> to all there is
<PB N="151" REF="172">one awful and infallible cata&s;trophe. Ap|prize her that the e&s;timation which man|kind forms of merit is not always ju&s;t, nor its prai&s;e exactly proportioned to de&s;ert; that the world weighs actions in far different &s;cales from <Q>the balance of the &s;anctuary,</Q> and e&s;timates worth by a far different &s;tandard from that of the go&s;pel; apprize her that while her be&s;t intentions may be &s;ometimes calumniated, and her be&s;t actions mi&s;repre&s;ented, &s;he will be liable to receive commendation on occa|&s;ions wherein her con&s;cience will tell her &s;he has not de&s;erved it.</P>
<P>Do not however give her a gloomy and di&s;couraging picture of the world, but rather &s;eek to give her a ju&s;t and &s;ober view of the part &s;he will have to act in it. And humble the impetuo&s;ity of hope, and cool the ardour of expectation, by explaining to her that this part, even in her be&s;t e&s;tate, will probably con&s;i&s;t in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of petty trials, and a round of quiet duties which, however well per|formed,

<P>Say not that the&s;e ju&s;t and &s;ober views will cruelly wither her young hopes, and deaden the innocent &s;atisfactions of life. It is not true.

It is not meant that you &s;hould darken her pro&s;pect, &s;o much as that you &s;hould enlighten her under&s;tanding to contemplate it. And though her feel|ings, ta&s;tes, and pa&s;&s;ions, will all be again&s;t you, if you &s;et before her a faithful de|lineation of life, yet it will be &s;omething to get her judgment on your &s;ide.

Of cour&s;e &s;he has been &s;o far from thinking it nece&s;&s;ary to enter into the enumeration of tho&s;e books which are u&s;eful in general in&s;truction, that &s;he has forborne to mention any. With &s;uch books the ri&s;ing generation is far more copiou&s;ly and ably furni&s;hed than any preceding period has
<PB N="155" REF="176">been; and out of an excellent variety the judicious in&s;tructor can hardly fail to make &s;uch a &s;election as &s;hall be beneficial to the pupil.</P>
<P>But while due prai&s;e ought not to be withheld from the improved methods of communicating the elements of general knowledge; yet is there not &s;ome danger that our very advantages may lead us into error, by cau&s;ing us to repo&s;e &s;o con|fidently on the multiplied helps which facilitate the entrance into learning, as to render our pupils &s;uperficial through the very facility of acquirement? Where &s;o much is done for them, may they not be led to do too little for them&s;elves? May there not be a moral di&s;advantage in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them with the notion that learn|ing may be acquired without diligence and labour? Sound education never <HI>can</HI> be made a "primro&s;e path of dalliance." Do what we will we cannot <HI>cheat</HI> children into learning or <HI>play</HI> them into knowledge, according to the &s;moothne&s;s of the modern
<PB N="156" REF="177">creed. There is no idle way to any acqui&s;i|tions which really de&s;erve the name. And as Euclid, in order to repre&s;s the im|petuous vanity of greatne&s;s, told his Sove|reign that there was no royal way to geometry, &s;o the fond mother may be a&s;&s;ured that there is no &s;hort cut to any other kind of learning. The tree of knowledge, as a puni&s;hment perhaps, for its having been at fir&s;t unfairly ta&s;ted, cannot now be climbed without difficulty; and this very circum&s;tance &s;erves afterwards to furni&s;h not only literary plea&s;ures, but moral advantages: for the knowledge which is acquired by unwearied a&s;&s;iduity is la&s;t|ing in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and &s;weet to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; both perhaps in proportion to the co&s;t and labour of the acqui&s;ition. And though an able teacher ought to endeavour, by improving the communicat|ing faculty in him&s;elf, (for many know what they cannot teach,) to &s;often every difficulty; yet in &s;pite of the kindne&s;s and ability with which he will &s;mooth every
<PB N="157" REF="178">ob&s;truction, it is probably, among the wi&s;e in&s;titutions of Providence, that great diffi|culties &s;hould &s;till remain. For education is but an initiation into that life of trial to which we are introduced on our entrance into this world. It is the fir&s;t breaking-in to that &s;tate of toil and labour to which we are born; and in this view of the &s;ubject the acqui&s;ition of learning may be converted to higher u&s;es than &s;uch as are purely literary.</P>
<P>Will it not be a&s;cribed to a captious &s;ingularity if I venture to remark that real knowledge and real piety, though they have gained in many in&s;tances, have &s;uffered in others from that profu&s;ion of little, amu&s;ing, &s;entimental books with which the youthful library overflows? Abundance has its dangers as well as &s;carcity. In the fir&s;t place may not the multiplicity of the&s;e alluring little works increa&s;e the natural reluctance to tho&s;e more dry and unintere&s;ting &s;tudies, of which after all, the rudiments of every
<PB N="158" REF="179">part of learning <HI>mu&s;t</HI> con&s;i&s;t? And, &s;econdly, is there not &s;ome danger (though there are many honourable exceptions) that &s;ome of tho&s;e engaging narratives may &s;erve to infu&s;e into the youthful heart a &s;ort of &s;purious goodne&s;s, a confi|dence of virtue? And that the benevolent actions with the recital of which they abound, when they are not made to flow from any &s;ource but feeling, may tend to in&s;pire &s;elf-complacency, a &s;elf-gratu|lation, a "&s;tand by, for I am holier than "thou?" May they not help to infu&s;e a love of popularity and an anxiety for prai&s;e, in the place of that &s;imple and uno&s;tentatious rule of doing whatever good we do, <HI>becau&s;e it is the will of God?</HI> The univer&s;al &s;ub&s;titution of this principle would tend to purify the worldly morality of many a popular little &s;tory. And there are few dangers which good parents will more carefully guard again&s;t than that of giving their children a mere political piety; that &s;ort of religion which ju&s;t goes to make
<PB N="159" REF="180">people more re&s;pectable, and to &s;tand well with the world <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An ingenious (and in many re&s;pects u&s;eful) French Treati&s;e on Education, has too much en|couraged this political piety; by &s;ometimes con|&s;idering religion as a thing of human convention; as a thing creditable rather than commanded; by erecting the doctrine of expediency in the place of Chri&s;tian &s;implicity; and wearing away the &s;pirit of truth, by the &s;ub&s;titution of occa&s;ional deceit, equivocation, &s;ubterfuge, and mental re&s;ervation.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There is a certain precocity of mind which is much helped on by the&s;e &s;uper|ficial modes of in&s;truction; for frivolous reading will produce its corre&s;pondent effect, in much le&s;s time than books of &s;olid in&s;truction; the imagination being liable to be worked upon, and the feelings to be &s;et a going, much fa&s;ter than the under&s;tanding can be opened and the judgment enlightened. A talent for con|ver&s;ation &s;hould be the re&s;ult of educa|tion, not its precur&s;or; it is a golden fruit when &s;uffered to ripen gradually on the tree of knowledge; but if forced in the
<PB N="160" REF="181">hot-bed of a circulating library, it will turn out worthle&s;s and vapid in proportion as it was artificial and premature. Girls who have been accu&s;tomed to devour frivolous books, will conver&s;e and write with a far greater appearance of &s;kill as to &s;tyle and &s;entiment at twelve or four|teen years old, than tho&s;e of a more advanced age who are under the di&s;cipline of &s;everer &s;tudies; but the former having early attained to that low &s;tandard which had been held out to them, became &s;tationary; while the latter, quietly pro|gre&s;&s;ive, are pa&s;&s;ing through ju&s;t gradations to a higher &s;train of mind; and tho&s;e who early begin with talking and writing like women, commonly end with thinking and acting like children.</P>
<P>The &s;warms of <HI>Abridgments, Beauties,</HI> aud <HI>Compendiums,</HI> which form too con|fiderable a part of a young lady's library, may be confidered in many in&s;tances as an infallible receipt for making a &s;uperficial mind. The <HI>names</HI> of the renowned cha|racters
<PB N="161" REF="182">in hi&s;tory thus become familiar in the mouths of tho&s;e who can neither attach to the idea of the per&s;on, the &s;eries of his actions, nor the peculiarities of his character. A few fine pa&s;&s;ages from the poets (pa&s;&s;ages perhaps which derived their chief beauty from their po&s;ition and connection) are huddled together by &s;ome extract-maker, who&s;e brief and di&s;|connected patches of broken and di&s;|cordant materials, while they inflame young readers with the vanity of reciting, neither fill the mind nor form the ta&s;te: and it is not difficult to trace back to their &s;hallow &s;ources the hackney'd quotations of cer|tain <HI>accompli&s;hed</HI> young ladies, who will be frequently found not to have come legiti|mately by any thing they know: I mean, not to have drawn it from its true &s;pring, the original works of the author from which &s;ome <HI>beauty-monger</HI> has &s;evered it. Human incon&s;i&s;tency in this, as in other ca&s;es, wants to combine two irreconcile|able things; it &s;trives to unite the reputa|tion
<PB N="162" REF="183">of knowledge with the plea&s;ures of idlene&s;s, forgetting that nothing that is valuable can be obtained without &s;acrifices, and that if we would purcha&s;e knowledge we mu&s;t pay for it the fair and lawful price of time and indu&s;try.</P>
<P>This remark is by no means of general application; there are many valuable works which from their bulk would be almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible to a great number of readers, and a con&s;iderable part of which may not be generally u&s;eful. Even in the be&s;t written books there is often &s;uper|fluous matter; authors are apt to get enamoured of their &s;ubject, and to dwell too long on it: every per&s;on cannot find time to read a longer work on any &s;ubject, and yet it may be well for them to know &s;omething on almo&s;t every &s;ubject; tho&s;e therefore, who abridge voluminous works judiciou&s;ly, render &s;ervice to the commu|nity. But there &s;eems, if I may venture the remark, to be a mi&s;take in the <HI>u&s;e</HI> of abridgments. They are put &s;y&s;tematically
<PB N="163" REF="184">into the hands of youth, who have, or ought to have lei&s;ure for the works at large; while abridgments &s;eem more im|mediately calculated for per&s;ons in more advanced life, who wi&s;h to recal &s;omething they had forgotten; who want to re&s;tore old ideas rather than acquire new ones; or they are u&s;eful for per&s;ons immer&s;ed in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the world who have little lei&s;ure for voluminous reading. They are excellent to refre&s;h the mind, but not competent to form it.</P>
<P>Perhaps there is &s;ome analogy between the mental and bodily conformation of women. The in&s;tructor therefore &s;hould imitate the phy&s;ician. If the latter pre|&s;cribe bracing medicines for a body of which delicacy is the di&s;ea&s;e, the former would do well to prohibit relaxing reading for a mind which is already of too &s;oft a texture, and &s;hould &s;trengthen its feeble tone by invigorating reading.</P>
<P>By &s;oftne&s;s, I cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to mean imbecility of under&s;tanding, but
<PB N="164" REF="185">natural &s;oftne&s;s of heart, with that indo|lence of &s;pirit which is fo&s;tered by indulg|ing in &s;educing books and in the general habits of fa&s;hionable life.</P>
<P>I mean not here to recommend books which are immediately religious, but &s;uch as exerci&s;e the rea&s;oning faculties, teach the mind to get acquainted with its own nature, and to &s;tir up its own powers. Let not a timid young lady &s;tart if I &s;hould venture to recommend to her, after a proper cour&s;e of preparation, to &s;wallow and dige&s;t &s;uch &s;trong meat, as Watts's or Duncan's little book of Logic, &s;ome parts of Mr. Locke's E&s;&s;ay on the Human Un|der&s;tanding, and Bi&s;hop Butler's Analogy. Where there is lei&s;ure, and capacity, and an able coun&s;ellor, works of this nature might be profitably &s;ub&s;tituted in the place of &s;o much Engli&s;h Sentiment, French Philo|&s;ophy, Italian Poetry, and fanta&s;tic German imagery and magic wonders. While &s;uch enervating or ab&s;urd books &s;adly di&s;qualify the reader for &s;olid pur&s;uit or vigorous
<PB N="165" REF="186">thinking, the &s;tudies here recommended would act upon the con&s;titution of the mind as a kind of alterative, and, if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion, would help to brace the intellectual &s;tamina.</P>
<P>This is however by no means intended to exclude works of ta&s;te and imagination, which mu&s;t always make the ornamental part, and of cour&s;e a very con&s;iderable part of female &s;tudies. It is only &s;ug|ge&s;ted that they &s;hould not form them entirely. For what is called dry tough reading, independent of the knowledge it conveys, is u&s;eful as an habit and whole|&s;ome as an exerci&s;e. Serious &s;tudy &s;erves to harden the mind for more trying con|flicts; it lifts the reader from &s;en&s;ation to intellect; it ab&s;tracts her from the world and its vanities; it fixes a wandering &s;pirit, and fortifies a weak one; it divorces her from matter; it corrects that &s;pirit of trifling which &s;he naturally contracts from the frivolous turn of female conver&s;ation,
<PB N="166" REF="187">and the petty nature of female employ|ments; it concentrates her attention, a&s;&s;i&s;ts her in a habit of excluding tri|vial thoughts, and thus even helps to qualify her for religious pur&s;uits. Yes; I repeat it, there is to woman a Chri&s;tian u&s;e to be made of &s;ober &s;tudies; while books of an oppo&s;ite ca&s;t, however unex|ceptionable they may be &s;ometimes found in point of expre&s;&s;ion; however free from evil in its more gro&s;s and palpable &s;hapes, yet by their very nature and con&s;titution they excite a &s;pirit of relaxation, by exhibiting &s;cenes and ideas which &s;often the mind; they impair its general powers of re&s;i&s;tance, and at be&s;t feed habits of improper indulgence, and nonri&s;h a vain and vi&s;ionary indolence, which lays the mind open to error and the heart to &s;eduction.</P>
<P>Women are little accu&s;tomed to clo&s;e rea&s;oning on any &s;ubject; &s;till le&s;s do they inure their minds to con&s;ider particular
<PB N="167" REF="188">parts of a &s;ubject; they are not habituated to turn a truth round and view it in all its varied a&s;pects and po&s;itions; and this per|haps is one cau&s;e (as will be ob&s;erved in another <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chapter on Conver&s;ation.</NOTE> place) of the too great confi|dence they are di&s;po&s;ed to place in their opinions. Though their imagination is already too lively, and their judgment naturally incorrect; in educating them we go on to &s;timulate the imagination, while we neglect the regulation of the judgment. They already want balla&s;t, and we make their education con&s;i&s;t in continually crowding more &s;ail than they can carry. Their intellectual powers being &s;o little &s;trengthened by exerci&s;e, makes every little bu&s;ine&s;s appear a hard&s;hip to them: whereas ferious &s;tudy would be u&s;eful, were it only that it leads the mind to the habit of conquering difficulties. But it is peculiarly hard to turn at once from
<PB N="168" REF="189">the indolent repo&s;e of light reading, from the concerns of mere animal life, the objects of &s;en&s;e, or the frivolou&s;ne&s;s of chit chat; it is peculiarly hard, I &s;ay, to a mind &s;o &s;oftened, to re&s;cue it&s;elf from the dominion of &s;elf-indulgence, to re&s;ume its powers, to call home its &s;cat|tered &s;trength, to &s;hut out every foreign intru&s;ion, to force back a &s;pring &s;o un|naturally bent, and to devote it&s;elf to religious reading, reflection, or &s;elf-examination: whereas to an intellect accu&s;tomed to think at all the difficulty of thinking &s;eriou&s;ly is obviou&s;ly le&s;&s;ened.</P>
<P>Far be it from me to de&s;ire to make &s;chola&s;tic ladies or female dialecticians; but there is little fear that the kind of books here recommended, if thoroughly &s;tudied, and not &s;uperficially &s;kimmed, will make them pedants or induce conceit; for by &s;hewing them the po&s;&s;ible powers of the human mind, you will bring them to &s;ee the littlene&s;s of their own, and to
<PB N="169" REF="190">get acquainted with the mind and to regu|late it, does not &s;eem the way to puff it up. But let her who is di&s;po&s;ed to be elated with her literary acqui&s;itions, check her vanity by calling to mind the ju&s;t remark of Swift, <Q>that after all her boa&s;ted acquirements, a woman will, ge|nerally &s;peaking, be found to po&s;&s;e&s;s le&s;s of what is called learning than a common &s;chool-boy.</Q></P>
<P>Neither is there any fear that this &s;ort of reading will convert ladies into authors. The direct contrary effect will be likely to be produced by the peru&s;al of writers who throw the generality of readers at &s;uch an unapproachable di&s;tance. Who are tho&s;e ever multiplying authors, that with un|paralleled fecundity are over&s;tocking the world with their quick &s;ucceeding progeny? They are novel writers; the ea&s;ine&s;s of who&s;e productions is at once the cau&s;e of their own fruitfulne&s;s, and of the almo&s;t infinitely numerous race of imitators to
<PB N="170" REF="191">whom they give birth. Such is the fright|ful facility of this &s;pecies of compo&s;ition, that every raw girl while &s;he reads, is tempted to fancy that &s;he can al&s;o write. And as Alexander, on peru&s;ing the Iliad, found by congenial &s;ympathy the image of Achilles in his own ardent &s;oul, and felt him&s;elf the hero he was &s;tudying; and as Corregio, on fir&s;t beholding a picture which exhibited the perfection of the Graphic art, prophetically felt all his own future greatne&s;s, and cried out in rapture, "And I too am a painter!" &s;o a thorough paced novel reading Mi&s;s, at the clo&s;e of every ti&s;&s;ue of hackney'd adven|tures, feels within her&s;elf the &s;tirring impul&s;e of corre&s;ponding genius, and triumphantly exclaims, <Q>And I too am an author!&mdash;</Q> The glutted imagination &s;oon overflows with the redundance of cheap &s;entiment and plentiful incident, and by a &s;ort of arithmetical proportion, is enabled by the peru&s;al of any three
<PB N="171" REF="192">novels to produce a fourth; till every fre&s;h production, like the progeny of Banquo, is followed by <Q>Another, and another, and another <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is &s;urely not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate, that no di&s;re&s;pect can be here intended to tho&s;e females of real genius and correct character, &s;ome of who&s;e ju&s;tly admired writings in this kind, are accurate hi&s;tories of life and manners, and &s;triking delineations of character. It is not <HI>their</HI> fault if their works have been attended with the con&s;equences which u&s;ually attend good originals, that of giving birth to a mul|titude of mi&s;erable imitations.</NOTE></Q> Is a lady, however de&s;titute of talents, education, or knowledge of the world, who&s;e &s;tudies have been completed by a circulating library, in any di&s;tre&s;s of mind? the writing a novel &s;ugge&s;ts it&s;elf as the be&s;t &s;oother of her &s;orrows! Does &s;he labour under any depre&s;&s;ion of circum|&s;tances? writing a novel occurs as the readie&s;t receipt for mending them! And &s;he &s;olaces her&s;elf with the conviction that
<PB N="172" REF="193">the &s;ub&s;cription which has been given to her importunity or her nece&s;&s;ities, has been given to her genius. And this confi|dence in&s;tantly levies a fre&s;h contribution for a &s;ucceeding work. Capacity and cultivation are &s;o little taken into the account, that writing a book &s;eems to be now con&s;idered as the only &s;ure re&s;ource which the idle and the illiterate have always in their power.</P>
<P>May I be indulged in a &s;hort digre&s;&s;ion to remark, though rather out of its place, that the corruption occa&s;ioned by the&s;e books has &s;pread &s;o wide, and de|&s;cended &s;o low, that not only among milleners, mantua-makers, and other trades where numbers work together, the labour of one girl is frequently &s;acrificed that &s;he may be &s;pared to read tho&s;e mi&s;chievous books to the others; but the Author has been a&s;&s;ured by clergymen, who have witne&s;&s;ed the fact, that they are procured and greedily read in the wards of our Ho&s;pitals! an awful hint, that tho&s;e who
<PB N="173" REF="194">teach the poor to read, &s;hould not only take care to furni&s;h them with principles which will lead them to abhor corrupt books, but &s;hould al&s;o furni&s;h them with &s;uch books as &s;hall &s;trengthen and confirm their principles <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The above facts furni&s;h no argument on the &s;ide of tho&s;e who would keep the poor in ignorance. Tho&s;e who cannot <HI>read</HI> can <HI>hear,</HI> and are likely to hear to wor&s;e purpo&s;e than tho&s;e who have been better taught. And that ignorance furni&s;hes no &s;ecurity for integrity either in morals or politics, the late revolts in more than one country, remarkable for the ignorance of the poor, fully illu&s;trates. It is earne&s;tly hoped that the above facts may tend to impre&s;s ladies with the importance of &s;uperintend|ing the in&s;truction of the poor, and of making it an indi&s;pen&s;able part of their charity to give them moral and religious books.</NOTE>. And let every Chri&s;t|ian remember, that there is no other way of entering truly into the &s;pirit of that divine prayer, which petitions that the name of God may be "hallowed," that <Q>his kingdom (of grace) may come,</Q> and that <Q>his will may be done on earth as it
<PB N="174" REF="195">is in heaven,</Q> than by each individual contributing according to his mea&s;ure to accompli&s;h the work for which he prays; for to pray that the&s;e great objects may be promoted, without contributing to their promotion, is a palpable incon&s;i&s;tency.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. <HI>On the religious and moral u&s;e of hi&s;tory and geography.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BUT while every &s;ort of u&s;eful know|ledge &s;hould be carefully imparted to young per&s;ons, it &s;hould be imparted not merely for its own &s;ake, but al&s;o for the &s;ake of its &s;ub&s;erviency to higher things. All human learning &s;hould be taught not as an end but a means; and in this view even a le&s;&s;on of hi&s;tory or geography may be converted into a le&s;&s;on of religion. In the &s;tudy of hi&s;tory, the in&s;tructor will accu&s;tom the pupil not merely to &s;tore her memory with facts and anecdotes, and to a&s;certain dates and epochas; but &s;he will accu&s;tom her al&s;o to trace effects to their cau&s;es, to examine the &s;ecret &s;prings of action, and to ob&s;erve
<PB N="176" REF="197">the operation of the pa&s;&s;ions. It is only meant to notice here &s;ome few of the moral benefits which may be derived from a judicious peru&s;al of hi&s;tory; and from among other points of in&s;truction, I &s;elect the following:
<LIST>
<ITEM>The &s;tudy of hi&s;tory may &s;erve to give a clearer in&s;ight into the corruption of human nature:</ITEM>
<ITEM>It may &s;how the <HI>plan</HI> of Providence in the direction of events, and in the u&s;e of unworthy in&s;truments:</ITEM>
<ITEM>It may a&s;&s;i&s;t in the <HI>vindication</HI> of Provi|dence, in the common failure of virtue and the &s;ucce&s;s of vice:</ITEM>
<ITEM>It may lead to a di&s;tru&s;t of our own judgment:</ITEM>
<ITEM>It may contribute to our improvement in &s;elf-knowledge.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>But to prove to the pupil the important doctrine of human corruption from the &s;tudy of hi&s;tory, will require a truly Chri&s;tian commentator; for, from the low &s;tandard of right e&s;tabli&s;hed by the gene|rality
<PB N="177" REF="198">of hi&s;torians, who erect &s;o many per&s;ons into good characters who fall &s;hort of the true idea of Chri&s;tian virtue, the una&s;&s;i&s;ted reader will be liable to form very imperfect views of what is real goodne&s;s; and will conclude, as his author &s;ometimes does, that the true idea of human nature is to be taken from the medium between his be&s;t and his wor&s;t characters; without acquiring a ju&s;t notion of that prevalence of evil, which, in &s;pite of tho&s;e few brighter luminaries that here and there ju&s;t &s;erve to gild the gloom of hi&s;tory, tends abundantly to e&s;tabli&s;h the doctrine. It will indeed be continually e&s;tabli&s;hing it&s;elf by tho&s;e who, in peru&s;ing the hi&s;tory of mankind, carefully mark the progre&s;s of &s;in, from the fir&s;t timid irruption of an evil thought, to the fearle&s;s accompli&s;hment of the abhorred crime in which that thought has ended: from the indignant que&s;tion <Q>Is thy &s;ervant a dog that he &s;hould do this great thing <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Kings, viii. 13.</NOTE>?</Q>
<PB N="178" REF="199">to the perpetration of that very enormity of which he could not endure the &s;lighte&s;t &s;ugge&s;tion.</P>
<P>The religious reader of general hi&s;tory will ob&s;erve the controlling hand of Provi|dence in the direction of events, and in turning the mo&s;t unworthy actions and in&s;truments to the accompli&s;hment of his own purpo&s;es. She will mark infinite Wi&s;dom directing what appears to be ca&s;ual occurrences, to the completion of his own plan. She will point out how cau&s;es &s;eemingly the mo&s;t unconnected, events &s;eemingly the mo&s;t unpromi&s;ing, circum|&s;tances &s;eemingly the mo&s;t incongruous, are all working together for &s;ome final good. She will mark how national as well as individual crimes are often over|ruled to &s;ome hidden purpo&s;e far different from the intention of the actors: how Omnipotence can and often does, bring about the be&s;t purpo&s;es by the wor&s;t in|&s;truments: how the bloody and unju&s;t conqueror is but "the rod of HIS wrath,"

<P>To explain my meaning by a few in|&s;tances. When the &s;pirit of the youthful reader ri&s;es in hone&s;t indignation at that hypocritical piety which divorced an un|offending Queen to make way for the lawful crime of our eighth Henry's mar|riage with Ann Boleyn; and when that indignation is increa&s;ed by the more open profligacy which brought about the execu|tion of the latter; the in&s;tructor will not lo&s;e &s;o fair an occa&s;ion for unfolding how in the councils of the Mo&s;t High the crimes of the king were overruled to the happine&s;s of the country; and how, to this inau&s;picious marriage, from which the
<PB N="181" REF="202">heroic Elizabeth &s;prung, the Prote&s;tant religion owed its firm &s;tability.</P>
<P>She will explain to her, how even the conque&s;ts of ambition, after having deluged a land with blood, and involved the perpe|trator in guilt, and the innocent victim in ruin, may yet be made the in&s;truments of opening to future generations the way to commerce, to civilization, to Chri&s;tianity. She may remind her, as they are following Cae&s;ar in his inva&s;ion of Britain, that whereas the conqueror fancied he was only gratifying his own inordinate ambition, ex|tending the flight of the Roman Eagle, immortalizing his own name, and proving that "this world was made for Cae&s;ar;" he was in reality becoming the effectual though uncon&s;cious in&s;trument of leading a land of barbarians to civilization and to &s;cience; and was in fact preparing an i&s;land of Pagans to embrace the religion of Chri&s;t. She will inform her, that when the above-named victorious nation had made Judea a Roman province, and the
<PB N="182" REF="203">Jews had become their tributaries, the Romans did not know, nor did the indig|nant Jews &s;u&s;pect, that this circum&s;tance was confirming an event the mo&s;t import|ant the world ever &s;aw.</P>
<P>For when <Q>Augu&s;tus &s;ent forth a decree that all the world &s;hould be taxed;</Q> he thought he was only enlarg|ing his own imperial power, whereas he was acting in uncon&s;cious &s;ub&s;ervience to the decree of a higher Sovereign, and was helping to a&s;certain by a public act the exact period of Chri&s;t's birth, and fur|ni&s;hing a record of his extraction from that family from which it was predicted he &s;hould &s;pring. Herod's atrocious murder of the innocents has added an additional circum&s;tance for the confirma|tion of <HI>our</HI> faith; nay, the treachery of Judas, and the inju&s;tice of Pilate, were the human in&s;truments employed for the &s;alvation of the world.</P>
<P>The youth that is not armed with Chri&s;tian principles, will be tempted to
<PB N="183" REF="204">mutiny not only again&s;t the ju&s;tice, but the very exi&s;tence of a &s;uperintending Provi|dence, in contemplating tho&s;e frequent in&s;tances which occur in hi&s;tory of the ill &s;ucce&s;s of the more virtuous cau&s;e, and the pro&s;perity of the wicked. He will &s;ee with a&s;toni&s;hment that it is Rome which triumphs, while Carthage, which had clearly the better cau&s;e, falls. Now and then indeed a Cicero prevails, and a Cataline is &s;ubdued: but often, it is Cae&s;ar &s;ucce&s;sful again&s;t the &s;omewhat ju&s;ter preten&s;ions of Pompey, and again&s;t the &s;till clearer cau&s;e of Cato. It is Octavius who triumphs, and it is over Brutus that he triumphs! It is Tiberius that is enthroned, while Germanicus falls!</P>
<P>Thus his faith in a righteous Providence at fir&s;t view is &s;taggered, and he is ready to &s;ay, Surely it is not God that governs the earth! But on a fuller confideration (and here the &s;ugge&s;tions of a Chri&s;tian in&s;tructor are peculiarly wanted,) there
<PB N="184" REF="205">will appear great wi&s;dom in this very confu&s;ion of vice and virtue; for it is calculated to &s;end one's thoughts forward to a world of retribution, the principle of retribution being &s;o imperfectly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in this. It is indeed &s;o far com|mon for virtue to have the advantage here, in point of happine&s;s at lea&s;t, though not of glory, that the cour&s;e of Providence is &s;till calculated to prove that God is on the &s;ide of virtue; but &s;till, virtue is &s;o often un&s;ucce&s;sful, that clearly the God of virtue, in order that his work may be perfect, mu&s;t have in re&s;erve a world of retribution. This confu&s;ed &s;tate of things therefore is ju&s;t that &s;tate which is mo&s;t of all calculated to confirm the deeply con&s;i|derate mind in the belief of a future &s;tate: for if all were even here, or very nearly &s;o, &s;hould we not &s;ay <Q>Ju&s;tice is already &s;arisfied, and there <HI>needs</HI> no other world?</Q> On the other hand, if vice always triumphed, &s;hould we not then

<P>It &s;eems &s;o very important to ground young per&s;ons in the belief that they will not inevitably meet in this world with reward and &s;ucce&s;s according to their merit, but to habituate them to expect even the mo&s;t virtuous attempts to be often, though not always di&s;appointed, that I am in danger of tautology on this point. This fact is preci&s;ely what hi&s;tory teaches. The truth &s;hould be plainly told to the young reader; and the antidote to that evil, which mi&s;taken and worldly people would expect to ari&s;e from divulging this di&s;couraging doctrine, is <HI>faith.</HI> The importance of faith there|fore, and the nece&s;&s;ity of it to real, un|bending, and per&s;evering virtue, is &s;urely made plain by profane hi&s;tory it&s;elf. For the &s;ame thing which happens to &s;tates and kings, happens to private life and to individuals.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="207">
Di&s;tru&s;t and diffidence in our own judg|ment &s;eems to be al&s;o an important in|&s;truction to be learnt from hi&s;tory. How contrary to all expectation do the events therein recorded commonly turn out? and yet we proceed to fortell this and that event from the appearances of things under our own ob&s;ervation, with the &s;ame arro|gant certainty as if we had never been warned by the monitory annals of man|kind.</P>
<P>There is &s;carcely one great event in hi&s;tory which does not, in the i&s;&s;ue, pro|duce effects upon which human fore&s;ight could never have calculated. The &s;ucce&s;s of Augu&s;tus again&s;t his country produced peace in many di&s;tant provinces, who thus cea&s;ed to be hara&s;&s;ed and tormented by this oppre&s;&s;ive republic. Could this effect have been fore&s;een, it might have &s;obered the de&s;pair of Cato, and checked the vehe|mence of Brutus. In politics, in &s;hort in every thing, except in morals and religion, all is, to a con&s;iderable degree, uncertain.
<PB N="187" REF="208">This rea&s;oning is not meant to &s;hew that Cato ought not to have <HI>fought,</HI> but that he ought not to have <HI>de&s;ponded</HI> even after the la&s;t battle; and certainly, even upon his own principles, ought not to have killed him&s;elf. It would be departing too much from my object to apply this argument again&s;t tho&s;e who were driven to unrea&s;on|able di&s;tru&s;t and de&s;pair by the late &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es of a neighbouring nation.</P>
<P>But all knowledge will be compara|tively of little value, if we neglect &s;elf|knowledge; and of &s;elf-knowledge hi&s;to|ry and biography may be made &s;ucce&s;sful vehicles.

<P>May I be permitted to &s;ugge&s;t a few in|&s;tances, by way of &s;pecimen, how both &s;a|cred and common hi&s;tory may tend to promote &s;elf-knowledge? And let me again remind the warm admirer of &s;uffer|ing piety under extraordinay trials, that if

<P>While &s;he reads with horror that Bel|&s;hazzar was rioting with his thou&s;and no|bles at the very moment when the Per&s;ian army was bur&s;ting through the brazen gates of Babylon; is &s;he very &s;ure that &s;he her&s;elf, in an almo&s;t equally imminent moment of public danger, has not been nightly indulging in every &s;pecies of di&s;&s;i|pation?</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="211">
When &s;he is deploring the incon&s;i&s;tency of the human heart while &s;he contra&s;ts Mark Anthony's bravery and contempt of ea&s;e at one period, with his licentious in|dulgences at another; or while &s;he la|ments over the intrepid &s;oul of Cae&s;ar, whom &s;he had been following in his pain|ful marches, or admiring in his contempt of death, di&s;&s;olved in di&s;&s;olute plea&s;ures with the en&s;naring Queen of Egypt; let her examine whether &s;he her&s;elf has never, though in a much lower degree, evinced &s;omething of the &s;ame incon&s;i&s;tency? whe|ther &s;he who lives perhaps an orderly, &s;ober, and rea&s;onable life, during her &s;um|mer re&s;idence in the country, does not plunge with little &s;cruple in the winter into all the mo&s;t extravagant plea&s;ures of the capital? whether &s;he never carries about with her an accommodating kind of reli|gion, which can be made to bend to places and &s;ea&s;ons, to climates and cu&s;toms; which takes its tincture from the fa&s;hion

For though in

<P><PB N="193" REF="214">
In like manner, in the &s;tudy of geo|graphy and natural hi&s;tory, the attention &s;hould be habitually turned to the goodne&s;s of Providence, who commonly adapts the various productions of climates to the peculiar wants of the re&s;pective inhabitants. To illu&s;trate my meaning by one or two in&s;tances out of a thou&s;and. The reader may be led to admire the con&s;iderate good|ne&s;s of Providence in having cau&s;ed the &s;piry fir, who&s;e &s;lender foliage does not ob&s;truct the beams of the &s;un, to grow in the dreary regions of the North, who&s;e &s;hivering inhabitants could &s;pare none of its &s;canty rays; while in the torrid zone, the palm tree, the plantane, and the banana, &s;pread their umbrella leaves to break the almo&s;t intolerable fervors of a vertical &s;un. How the camel, who is the &s;ole carrier of all the merchandi&s;e of Turkey, Per&s;ia, Egypt, Arabia, and Bar|bary,
<PB N="194" REF="215">who is obliged to tran&s;port his in|credible burthens through countries in which pa&s;ture is &s;o rare, can &s;ub&s;i&s;t twenty-four hours without food, and can travel, loaded, many days without water, through dry and du&s;ty de&s;erts, which &s;upply none; and all this, not from the habit, but from the conformation of the animal: for Na|turali&s;ts make this conformity of powers to climates a rule of judgment in a&s;cer|taining the native countries of animals, and always determine it to be that to which their powers and properties are mo&s;t appro|priate.</P>
<P>Thus the writers of natural hi&s;tory are perhaps unintentionally magnifying the operations of Providence, when they in&s;i&s;t that animals do not modify and give way to the influence of other climates; but here they too commonly &s;top; and here the pious in&s;tructor will come in, in aid of their deficiency: for Philo&s;ophers too &s;eldom trace up cau&s;es, and wonders, and ble&s;&s;ings to their Author. And it is
<PB N="195" REF="216">peculiarly to be regretted that &s;uch a writer as Buffon, who, though not famous for his accuracy, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch diver&s;ified powers of de&s;cription, that he had the talent of making the drye&s;t &s;ubjects in|tere&s;ting; together with &s;uch a liveline&s;s of delineation, that his characters of ani|mals are drawn with a &s;pirit and variety rather to be looked for in an hi&s;torian of men than of bea&s;ts: it is to be regretted that this writer is ab&s;olutely inadmi&s;&s;ible into the library of a young lady, both on account of his immode&s;ty and his impiety; and if, in wi&s;hing to exclude him, it may be thought wrong to have given him &s;o much commendation, it is only meant to &s;how that the author is not led to re|probate his principles from in&s;en&s;ibility to his talents <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gold&s;mith's Hi&s;tory of animated Nature has many references to a divine Author.

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. <HI>On the u&s;e of definitions, and the moral benefits of accuracy in language.</HI></HEAD>
<Q>PERSONS having been accu&s;tomed from their cradles to learn words before they knew the ideas for which they &s;tand, u&s;ually continue to do &s;o all their lives, never taking the pains to &s;ettle in their minds the determined ideas which be|long to them. This want of a preci&s;e &s;ignification in their words, when they come to rea&s;on, <HI>e&s;pecially in moral matters,</HI> is the cau&s;e of very ob&s;cure and uncertain notions. They u&s;e the&s;e un|determined words confidently, without much troubling their heads about a certain fixed meaning, whereby, be&s;ides the ea&s;e of it, they obtain this advantage, that as in &s;uch di&s;cour&s;e they are &s;eldom
<PB N="197" REF="218">in the right, &s;o they are as &s;eldom to be convinced that they are in the wrong, it being ju&s;t the &s;ame to go about to draw tho&s;e per&s;ons out of their mi&s;takes, who have no &s;ettled notions, as to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s a vagrant of his habitation who has no &s;ettled abode.&mdash;The chief end of lan|guage being to be under&s;tood, words &s;erve not for that end when they do not excite in the hearer the &s;ame idea which they &s;tand for in the mind of the &s;peaker <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Locke.</NOTE></Q>
<P>I have cho&s;en to &s;helter my&s;elf under the broad &s;anction of the great Author here quoted, with a view to apply this rule in philology to a moral purpo&s;e; for it applies to the veracity of conver&s;ation as much as to its correctne&s;s; and as &s;trongly recommends unequivocal and &s;imple truth, as accurate and ju&s;t expre&s;&s;ion. Scarcely any one perhaps has an adequate con|ception how much clear and correct ex|pre&s;&s;ions
<PB N="198" REF="219">pre&s;&s;ions favour the elucidation of truth; and the &s;ide of truth is obviou&s;ly the &s;ide of morals; it is in fact one and the &s;ame cau&s;e; and it is of cour&s;e the &s;ame cau&s;e with that of true religion al&s;o.</P>
<P>It is therefore no worthle&s;s part of edu|cation to &s;tudy the preci&s;e meaning of words, and the appropriate &s;ignification of language. To this end I know no better method than to accu&s;tom young per&s;ons very early to define common words and things; for, as definition &s;eems to lie at the root of correctne&s;s, to be accu&s;tomed to define Engli&s;h words in Engli&s;h, would improve the under&s;tanding more than barely to know what tho&s;e words are called in French or Italian. Or rather one u&s;e of learning other languages is, becau&s;e definition is often involved in etymology; that is, &s;ince many Engli&s;h words take their derivation from foreign languages, they cannot be &s;o accurately under&s;tood without &s;ome knowledge of tho&s;e languages: but preci&s;ion of any
<PB N="199" REF="220">kind too &s;eldom finds its way into the education of women.</P>
<P>It is perhaps going out of my province to ob&s;erve, that it might be well if young <HI>men</HI> al&s;o, before they entered on the world, were to be furni&s;hed with correct definitions of certain words, the u&s;e of which is rather ambiguous. For in&s;tance; they &s;hould be provided with a good defi|nition of the word <HI>honour</HI> in the fa&s;hionable &s;en&s;e, &s;hewing what vices it includes and what virtues it does not include: the term <HI>good company,</HI> which even the courtly Petronius of our days has defined as &s;ome|times including not a few immoral and di&s;reputable characters: <HI>religion,</HI> which in the various &s;en&s;es a&s;&s;igned it by the world, &s;ometimes means &s;uper&s;tition, &s;ome|times fanatici&s;m, and &s;ometimes a mere di&s;po&s;ition to attend on any kind of form of wor&s;hip: the word <HI>goodne&s;s,</HI> which is made to mean every thing that is not notoriou&s;ly bad; and &s;ometimes even that too, if what is notoriou&s;ly bad be accom|panied
<PB N="200" REF="221">panied by good humour, plea&s;ing man|ners, and a little alms-giving. By the&s;e means they would go forth armed again&s;t many of the fal&s;e opinions which through the abu&s;e or ambiguous meaning of words pa&s;s &s;o current in the world.</P>
<P>But to return to the youthful part of that &s;ex which is the more immediate object of this little work. With correct definition they &s;hould al&s;o be taught to &s;tudy the &s;hades of words, and this not merely with a view to accuracy of expre&s;|&s;ion, but to moral truth.</P>
<P>It may be thought ridiculous to a&s;&s;ert, that morals have any connection with the purity of language, or that the preci&s;ion of truth may be violated through defect of critical exactne&s;s in the three degrees of compari&s;on: yet how frequently do we hear from the dealers in &s;uperlatives, of "mo&s;t admirable," &s;uper-excellent, and "quite perfect" people, who, to plain per&s;ons, not bred in the &s;chool of ex|aggeration, would appear mere common
<PB N="201" REF="222">characters, not ri&s;ing above the level of mediocrity! By this negligence in the ju&s;t application of words, we &s;hall be as much mi&s;led by the&s;e trope and figure ladies, when they degrade as when they panegyrize; for to a plain and &s;ober judgment, a trade&s;man may not be <Q>the mo&s;t good-for-nothing fellow that ever exi&s;ted,</Q> merely becau&s;e it was impo&s;|&s;ible for him to execute in an hour an order which required a week; a lady may not be <Q>the mo&s;t hideous fright the world ever &s;aw,</Q> though the make of her gown may have been ob&s;olete for a month; nor may one's young friend's father be <Q>a mon|&s;ter of cruelty,</Q> though he may be a quiet gentleman who does not choo&s;e to live at watering places, but likes to have his daughter &s;tay at home with him in the country.</P>
<P>But of all the parts of &s;peech the inter|jection is the mo&s;t abundantly in u&s;e with the hyperbolical fair ones. Would it could be added that the&s;e emphatical
<PB N="202" REF="223">expletives (if I may make u&s;e of a con|tradictory term) were not &s;ometimes tinctured with profanen&s;s! Though I am per&s;uaded that idle habit is more at the bottom of this deep offence than intended impiety, yet there is &s;carcely any error of youthful talk which wants &s;everer ca&s;tiga|tion. And an habit of exclamation &s;hould be rejected by poli&s;hed people as vulgar, even if it were not abhorred as profane.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation of young females is al&s;o in danger of being overloaded with epithers. As in the warm &s;ea&s;on of youth hardly any thing is &s;een in the true point of vi&s;ion, &s;o hardly any thing is named in naked &s;implicity; and the very &s;en&s;ibility of the feelings is partly a cau&s;e of the extravagance of the expre&s;&s;ion. But here as in other points the &s;acred writers, par|ticularly of the New Te&s;tament, pre&s;ent us with the pure&s;t models; and its natural and unlaboured &s;tyle of expre&s;&s;ion is perhaps not the meane&s;t evidence of the truth of the go&s;pel. There is throughout the
<PB N="203" REF="224">whole narratives, no overcharged cha|racter, no elaborate de&s;cription, nothing &s;tudiou&s;ly emphatical, as if truth of it&s;elf were weak, and wanted to be helped out. There is little panegyric, and le&s;s invective; none but on great, and awful, and ju&s;ti|fiable occa&s;ions. The authors record their own faults with the &s;ame hone&s;ty as if they were the faults of other men, and the faults of other men with as little amplifica|tion as if they were their own. There is perhaps no book in which adjectives are &s;o &s;paringly u&s;ed. A mode&s;t &s;tatement of the fact, with no colouring and little com|ment, is the example held out to us for correcting the exuberances of pa&s;&s;ion and of language, by that divine volume which furni&s;hes us with the &s;till more important rule of faith and &s;tandard of practice. Nor is the truth lowered by feeblene&s;s; for with all this plainne&s;s there is &s;o much force that a few &s;imple touches and artle&s;s &s;trokes of &s;cripture characters convey a &s;tronger outline of the per&s;on
<PB N="204" REF="225">delineated, than is &s;ometimes given by the mo&s;t elaborate portrait of more artificial hi&s;torians.</P>
<P>If it be objected to this remark that many parts of the &s;acred writings abound in a lofty, figurative, and even hyperbolical &s;tyle; this objection applies chiefly to the writings of the Old Te&s;tament, and to the prophetical and poetical parts of that. But this metaphorical and florid &s;tyle is di&s;tinct from the inaccurate and over|&s;trained expre&s;&s;ion we have been cen&s;uring; for that only is inaccuracy which leads to a fal&s;e and inadequate conception in the reader or hearer. The lofty &s;tyle of the Ea&s;tern, and of other heroic poetry does not &s;o mi&s;lead; for the metaphor is under|&s;tood to be a metaphor, and the imagery is under&s;tood to be ornamental. The &s;tyle of the &s;criptures of the Old Te&s;tament, are not it is true plain in oppofition to figurative, nor &s;imple in oppo&s;ition to florid; but it is plain and &s;imple in the be&s;t &s;en&s;e; it rai&s;es no fal&s;e idea; it gives
<PB N="205" REF="226">an exact impre&s;&s;ion of the thing it means to convey; and its very tropes and figures, though bold, are never unnatural or af|fected. Even when it exaggerates, it does not mi&s;repre&s;ent; if it be hyperbolical, it is &s;o either in compliance with the genius of oriental language, or in com|pliance with contemporary cu&s;toms, or be|cau&s;e the &s;ubject is one which will be mo&s;t forcibly impre&s;&s;ed by a bold figure. The loftine&s;s of the expre&s;&s;ion deducts nothing from the truth of the circum&s;tance, and animates the reader without mi&s;leading him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. <HI>On religion.&mdash;The nece&s;&s;ity and duty of early in&s;truction &s;hown by analogy with human learning.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT has been the fa&s;hion of our late inno|vators in philo&s;ophy, who have written &s;ome of the mo&s;t brilliant and popular treati&s;es on education, to decry the prac|tice of early in&s;tilling religious knowledge into the minds of children: it has been alleged that it is of the utmo&s;t importance to the cau&s;e of truth that the mind of man &s;hould be kept free from prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and in particular, that every one &s;hould be left to form &s;uch judgment on religious &s;ubjects as may &s;eem be&s;t to his own rea&s;on in maturer years.</P>
<P>This &s;entiment has received &s;ome coun|tenance from tho&s;e, who have wi&s;hed on
<PB N="207" REF="228">the faire&s;t principle, to encourage free inquiry in religion; but it has been pu&s;hed to the blameable exce&s;s here cen&s;ured, chiefly by the new philo&s;ophers; who, while they profe&s;s only an ingenuous zeal for truth, are in fact &s;lily endeavouring to de&s;troy Chri&s;tianity it&s;elf, by di&s;counte|nancing, under the plau&s;ible pretence of free inquiry, all attention whatever to the religious education of our youth.</P>
<P>It is undoubtedly our duty, while we are in&s;tilling principles into the tender mind, to take peculiar care that tho&s;e principles be &s;ound and ju&s;t; that the religion we teach be the religion of the Bible, and not the inventions of human error or &s;uper&s;ti|tion: that the principles we infu&s;e into others, be &s;uch as we our&s;elves have well &s;crutinized, and not the re&s;ult of our credulity or bigotry; nor the mere here|ditary, unexamined prejudices of our own undi&s;cerning childhood. It may al&s;o be granted that it is the duty of every parent to inform the youth, that when his facul|ties
<PB N="208" REF="229">&s;hall have &s;o unfolded them&s;elves as to enable him to examine for him&s;elf tho&s;e principles which the parent is now in&s;tilling, it will be his duty &s;o to examine them.</P>
<P>But after making the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions, I would mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly in&s;i&s;t that there are certain leading and fundamental truths; that there are certain &s;entiments on the fide of Chri&s;tianity, as well as of virtue and benevolence, in favour of which every child <HI>ought</HI> to be prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and may it not be al&s;o added, that to expect to keep the mind void of all prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, even upon any &s;ubject, appears to be altogether a vain and impracticable attempt?</P>
<P>Let it be ob&s;erved here that we are not combating the infidel; that we are not producing evidences and arguments in <HI>favour</HI> of Chri&s;tianity, or trying to win over the a&s;&s;ent of the reader to that which he di&s;putes; but that we are taking it for granted, not only that Chri&s;tianity is true, but that we are addre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e who
<PB N="209" REF="230">believe it to be true. A&s;&s;uming therefore that there are religious principles which are true, and which ought to be communicated in the mo&s;t effectual manner, the next que&s;tion which ari&s;es &s;eems to be, at what age and in what manner the&s;e ought to be inculcated? That it ought to be an early period we have both the example and the command of Chri&s;t; for he him&s;elf at|tended his parents in their annual public devotions at Jeru&s;alem during his own infancy; and afterwards in his public mini&s;tration encouragingly &s;aid, <Q>Suffer <HI>little</HI> children to come unto me.</Q></P>
<P>But here conceding for the &s;ake of argu|ment what yet cannot be conceded, that &s;ome good rea&s;ons <HI>may</HI> be brought in favour of delay; allowing that &s;uch im|pre&s;&s;ions as are communicated early, may not be very deep; allowing them even to become totally effaced by the &s;ub&s;equent corruptions of the heart and of the world; &s;till I would illu&s;trate the importance of early infu&s;ing religious knowledge, by an
<PB N="210" REF="231">allu&s;ion drawn from the power of early habit in human learning. Put the ca&s;e, for in&s;tance, of a per&s;on who was early initiated in the rudiments of cla&s;&s;ical &s;tudies. Suppo&s;e him after quitting &s;chool to have fallen, either by a cour&s;e of idlene&s;s or of vulgar pur&s;uits, into a total neglect of &s;tudy. Should this per&s;on at any future period happen to be called to &s;ome pro|fe&s;&s;ion, which &s;hould oblige him, as we &s;ay, to rub up his Greek and Latin; his memory &s;till retaining the unobliterated, though faint traces of his early pur&s;uits, he will be able to recover his neglected learn|ing with le&s;s difficulty than he could now begin to learn; for he is not again obliged to fet out with &s;tudying the &s;imple ele|ments; they come back on being pur|&s;ued; they are found on being fearched for; the decayed images a&s;&s;ume &s;hape and &s;trength; he has in his mind fir&s;t prin|ciples to which to recur; the rules of grammar which he has allowed him&s;elf to violate, he has not however forgotten;
<PB N="211" REF="232">he will recal neglected ideas, he will re&s;ume &s;lighted habits far more ea&s;ily than he could now begin to acquire new ones. I appeal to Clergymen who are called to attend the dying beds of &s;uch as have been bred in gro&s;s and &s;tupid ignorance of religion, for the ju&s;tne&s;s of this compari&s;on. Do they not find that the&s;e unhappy people have no ideas in common with them? that they po&s;&s;e&s;s no intelligible medium by which to make them&s;elves under&s;tood? that the per&s;ons to whom they are addre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves have no fir&s;t principles to which they can be referred? that they are ignorant not only of the &s;cience, but the language of Chri&s;tianity?</P>
<P>But at wor&s;t, whatever be the event to the child, though in general we are en|couraged, from the tenor of Scripture and the cour&s;e of experience, to hope that that event would be favourable, is it no|thing for the parent to have acquitted him|&s;elf of this prime duty? And will not the
<PB N="212" REF="233">parent who &s;o acquits him&s;elf, with better rea&s;on and more lively hope; &s;upplicate the Father of mercies for the reclaiming of a prodigal, who has wandered out of that right path in which he had &s;et him forward, than for the conver&s;ion of a neglected creature to who&s;e feet the Go&s;pel had never been offered as a light? And how different will be the dying reflections of that parent who&s;e earne&s;t endeavours have been defeated by the &s;ub&s;equent and voluntary perver&s;ion of his child, from his who will rea&s;onably aggravate his pangs by transferring the fins of his neglected child to the number of his own tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>And to &s;uch well-intentioned but ill-judging parents, as really wi&s;h their chil|dren to be hereafter pious, but erroneou&s;ly withhold in&s;truction till the more advanced period pre&s;cribed by the great ma&s;ter of &s;plendid paradoxes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rou&s;&s;ean.</NOTE> &s;hall arrive; who
<PB N="213" REF="234">can a&s;&s;ure them that while they are with|holding the good &s;eed, the great and ever vigilant enemy, who a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly &s;eizes hold on every opportunity which <HI>we</HI> neglect, may not be &s;tocking the fallow ground with tares? Nay, who in this fluctuating &s;cene of things can be a&s;&s;ured, even if this were not certainly to be the ca&s;e, that to them the promi&s;ed period ever &s;hall arrive at all? Who &s;hall a&s;certain to them that their now neglected child &s;hall certainly live to receive the delayed in&s;truction? Who can a&s;&s;ure them that they them&s;elves will live to communicate it?</P>
<P>It is almo&s;t needle&s;s to ob&s;erve that parents who are indifferent about religion, much more tho&s;e who treat it with &s;corn, are not likely to be anxious on this &s;ub|ject; it is therefore the attention of <HI>religious</HI> parents which is here chie&s;ly called upon; and the more &s;o as there &s;eems, on this point, an unaccountable negligence in many of the&s;e, whether it ari&s;e from
<PB N="214" REF="235">indolence, fal&s;e principles, or whatever other motive.</P>
<P>But independent of knowledge, it is &s;omething, nay, let philo&s;ophers &s;ay what they will, it is much, to give youth <HI>pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions</HI> in favour of religion, to &s;ecure their <HI>prejudices</HI> on its &s;ide before you turn them adrift into the world; a world in which, before they can be completely armed with arguments and rea&s;ons, they will be a&s;&s;ailed by numbers who&s;e pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and prejudices, far more than <HI>their</HI> arguments and rea&s;ons, attach them to the other &s;ide. Why &s;hould not the Chri&s;t|ian youth furni&s;h him&s;elf in a good cau&s;e with the &s;ame natural armour which the enemies of religion wear in a bad one? Surely to &s;et out with &s;entiments in favour of the religion of our country, is no more an error or a weakne&s;s, than to grow up with a fondne&s;s for our country it&s;elf. Nay, if the love of our country be judged a fair principle, &s;urely a Chri&s;tian, who is
<PB N="215" REF="236">"a citizen of no mean city," may law|fully have <HI>his</HI> attachments too. If pa|trioti&s;m be an hone&s;t prejudice, Chri&s;tianity is not a &s;ervile one. Nay, let us teach the youth to hug his prejudices rather than to acquire that ver&s;atile and accommodat|ing citizen&s;hip of the world, by which he may be an Infidel in Paris, a Papi&s;t at Rome, and a Mu&s;&s;ulman at Cairo.</P>
<P>Let me not be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;o to elevate politics, or &s;o to depre&s;s religion, as to make any compari&s;on of the value of the one with the other, when I ob&s;erve, that between the true Briti&s;h patriot and the true Chri&s;tian, there will be this common re&s;emblance: the more deeply each of them inquires, the more will he be con|firmed in his re&s;pective attachment, the one to his country, the other to his reli|gion. I &s;peak with reverence of the im|mea&s;urable di&s;tance; but the more the one pre&s;&s;es on the firm arch of our con&s;titution, and the other on that of Chri&s;tianity, the &s;tronger he will find them both. Each
<PB N="216" REF="237">challenges &s;crutiny; each has nothing to dread but from &s;hallow politicians and &s;hallow philo&s;ophers; in each intimate knowledge ju&s;tifies prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; in each inve&s;tigation confirms attachment.</P>
<P>If we divide the human being into three component parts, the bodily, the intel|lectual, and the &s;piritual, is it not rea&s;onable that a portion of care and attention be a&s;&s;igned to each in &s;ome degree adequate to its importance. Should I venture to &s;ay a <HI>due</HI> portion, a portion adapted to the real comparative value of each, would not that condemn in one word the whole &s;y&s;tem of modern education? Yet the rational and intellectual part is avowedly more valuable than the bodily, while the &s;piritual and immortal part exceeds even the intellectual &s;till more than that &s;ur|pa&s;&s;es what is corporeal. Is it then acting according to the common rules of propor|tion? Is it acting on the principles of di&s;tributive ju&s;tice? Is it acting with that good &s;en&s;e and right judgment with which
<PB N="217" REF="238">the ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s of this world is u&s;ually tran&s;acted, to give the larger pro|portion of time and care to that which is worth the lea&s;t? Is it fair that what relates to the body and the organs of the body, I mean tho&s;e accompli&s;hments which addre&s;s them&s;elves to the eye and the ear, &s;hould occupy almo&s;t the whole thoughts; that the intellectual part &s;hould be robbed of its due proportion, and that the &s;piritual part &s;hould have almo&s;t no proportion at all? Is not this preparing your children for an awful di&s;appointment in the tremendous day when they &s;hall be &s;tripped of that body which has been made almo&s;t the &s;ole object of their at|tention, and &s;hall feel them&s;elves left in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of nothing but that &s;piritual part, which in education was &s;carcely taken into the account of their exi&s;tence?</P>
<P>Surely it &s;hould be thought a rea&s;onable compromi&s;e (and I am in fact under|valuing the object for the importance of which I plead) to &s;ugge&s;t, that at lea&s;t
<PB N="218" REF="239">two thirds of that time which is now u&s;urped by externals, &s;hould be re&s;tored to the rightful owners, the under&s;tanding and the heart; and that the acqui&s;ition of religious knowledge in early youth, &s;hould at lea&s;t be <HI>no le&s;s</HI> an object of &s;edulous attention than the cultivation of human learning or of outward embelli&s;hments. It is al&s;o rea&s;onable to &s;ugge&s;t, that we &s;hould in Chri&s;tianity, as in arts, &s;ciences, or languages, begin with the beginning, &s;et out with the &s;imple elements, and thus "go on unto perfection."</P>
<P>Why in teaching to draw do you begin with &s;trait lines and curves, till by gentle &s;teps the knowledge of outline and propor|tion be attained, and your picture be com|pleted; never lo&s;ing &s;ight however of lines and curves? Why in mu&s;ic do you &s;et out with the &s;imple notes, and pur&s;ue the acqui&s;ition through all its progre&s;s, &s;till in every &s;tage recurring to the notes? Why in the &s;cience of numbers do you invent the &s;imple&s;t methods of conveying
<PB N="219" REF="240">ju&s;t ideas of computation, &s;till recurring to the tables which involve the funda|mental rules? Why in the &s;cience of quantity do men introduce the pupil at fir&s;t to the plaine&s;t diagrams, and clear up one difficulty before they allow another to appear? Why in teaching languages to the youth, do you &s;edulou&s;ly infu&s;e into his mind the rudiments of &s;yntax? Why in par&s;ing is he led to refer every word to its part of &s;peech, to re&s;olve every &s;entence into its elements, to reduce every term to its original, and from the fir&s;t ca&s;e of nouns, and the fir&s;t ten&s;e of verbs, to explain their formations, changes, and de|pendencies, till the principles of language become &s;o grounded, that by continually recurring to the rules, the &s;peaking and writing correctly are fixed into a habit? Why all this, but becau&s;e you uniformly wi&s;h him to be grounded in each of his acquirements? Why, but becau&s;e you are per&s;uaded that a &s;light and &s;lovenly, and &s;uperficial, and irregular way of in|&s;truction
<PB N="220" REF="241">will never train him to excellence in any thing?</P>
<P>Do young per&s;ons then become mu|&s;icians, and painters, and lingui&s;ts, and mathematicians, by early &s;tudy and regular labour; and &s;hall they become Chri&s;tians by accident? or rather, is not this acting on that very principle of Dogberry, at which you probably have often laughed? Is it not &s;uppo&s;ing, that religion, like "reading and writing, comes by Nature?" Shall all tho&s;e accompli&s;hments <Q>which peri&s;h in the u&s;ing,</Q> be &s;o a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly, &s;o &s;y&s;tematically taught? Shall all the&s;e habits be &s;o carefully formed, &s;o per&s;i&s;ted in, as to be interwoven with our very make, &s;o as to become as it were a part of our&s;elves, and &s;hall that knowledge which is to make us "wi&s;e unto &s;alvation," be picked up at random, cur&s;orily, or perhaps not picked up at all? Shall that difficult divine &s;cience which requires <Q>line upon line, and precept upon precept,</Q> here a little and there a little; which parents
<PB N="221" REF="242">even under a darker di&s;pen&s;ation, were required <Q>to teach their children <HI>diligently,</HI> and to talk of it when they &s;at down in their hou&s;e, and when they walked by the way, and when they lay down, and when they ro&s;e up;</Q> &s;hall this knowledge be by Chri&s;tian parents deferred, or taught &s;lightly; or be &s;uper&s;eded by things of little comparative worth?</P>
<P>Shall the lively period of youth, the &s;oft and impre&s;&s;ible &s;ea&s;on when la&s;ting habits are formed, when the &s;eal cuts deep into the yielding wax, and the im|pre&s;&s;ion is more likely to be clear and &s;trong? Shall this warm and favourable &s;ea&s;on be &s;uffered to &s;lide by, without being turned to the great purpo&s;e for which not only youth, but life, and breath, and being were be&s;towed? Shall not that <Q>faith without which it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God;</Q> &s;hall not that <Q>holine&s;s without which no man can &s;ee the Lord;</Q> &s;hall not that knowledge which is the founda|tion of faith and practice; &s;hall not that
<PB N="222" REF="243">charity without which all knowledge is vain, be impre&s;&s;ed, be inculcated, be in|forced, as early, as con&s;tantly, as funda|mentally, with the &s;ame earne&s;t pu&s;hing on to continual progre&s;s, with the &s;ame con|&s;tant reference to fir&s;t principles, as are u&s;ed in the ca&s;e of tho&s;e arts which merely adorn human life? Shall we not &s;eize the happy period when the memory is &s;trong, the mind and all its powers vigor|ous and active, the imaginat&s;on bu&s;y and all alive, the heart flexible, the temper ductile, the con&s;cience tender, curio&s;ity awake, fear powerful, hope eager, love ardent; for inculcating that knowledge, and impre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e principles which are to form the character, and fix the de&s;tina|tion for eternity?</P>
<P>Or, if I may be allowed to addre&s;s another and a &s;till more dilatory cla&s;s, who are for procra&s;tinating all concern about religion till we are driven to it by actual di&s;tre&s;s, like the &s;ailor who &s;aid <Q>he thought it was always time enough
<PB N="223" REF="244">to begin to pray when the &s;torm began.</Q> Of the&s;e I would a&s;k, &s;hall we, with an un|accountable deliberation, defer our anxiety about religion till the man and woman are become &s;o immer&s;ed in the cares of life, or &s;o entangled in its plea&s;ures, that they will have little heart or &s;pirit to embrace a new principle? a principle who&s;e pre|ci&s;e object it will be to condemn that very life into which they have already embarked; nay, to condemn almo&s;t all that they have been doing and thinking ever &s;ince they began to act or think? Shall we, I &s;ay, begin now? or &s;hall we &s;uffer tho&s;e in|&s;tructions, to receive which, requires all the concentrated powers of a &s;trong and healthy mind, to be put off till the day of excruciating pain, till the period of de|bility and &s;tupefaction? Shall we wait for that &s;ea&s;on, as if it were the mo&s;t favourable for religious acqui&s;itions, when the &s;en&s;es &s;hall have been palled by exce&s;&s;ive gratification, when the eye &s;hall be tired with &s;eeing, and the ear with
<PB N="224" REF="245">hearing? Shall we, when the whole man is breaking up by di&s;ea&s;e or decay, expect that the dim apprehen&s;ion will di&s;cern a new &s;cience, or the obtu&s;e feelings delight them&s;elves with a new plea&s;ure? a plea&s;ure too, not only incompatible with many of the hitherto indulged plea|&s;ures, but one which carries with it a &s;trong intimation that tho&s;e plea&s;ures ter|minate in the death of the &s;oul.</P>
<P>But, not to lo&s;e &s;ight of the important analogy on which we have already dwelt &s;o much; how prepo&s;terous would it &s;eem to you to hear any one propo&s;e to an illiterate dying man, to &s;et about learning even the plaine&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t rudiments of any new art; to &s;tudy the mu&s;ical notes; to con|jugate an auxiliary verb; to learn, not the fir&s;t problem in Euclid, but even the numeration table; and yet you do not think it ab&s;urd to po&s;tpone religious in|&s;truction, on principles, which, if admitted at all, mu&s;t terminate either in ignorance or in your propo&s;ing too late to a dying
<PB N="225" REF="246">man to begin to learn the totally unknown &s;cheme of Chri&s;tianity. You do not think it impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould be brought to li&s;ten to the <Q>voice of this charmer,</Q> when he can no longer li&s;ten to <Q>the voice of &s;inging men and &s;inging women.</Q> You do not think it unrea&s;onable that immortal beings &s;hould delay to devote their days to Heaven, till they have "no plea&s;ure in them" them|&s;elves. You will not bring them to offer up the fir&s;t fruits of their lips, and hearts, and lives, to their Maker, becau&s;e you per|&s;uade your&s;elves that he, who has called him&s;elf a "jealous God," may however be contented hereafter with the wretched &s;acrifice of decayed appetites, and the leav|ings of almo&s;t extingui&s;hed affections.</P>
<P>For one cannot believe that there is &s;carcely any one, except he be a decided infidel, who does not con&s;ider religion as at lea&s;t a good rever&s;ionary thing; as an object which ought always to occupy a little remote corner of his map of life;
<PB N="226" REF="247">the &s;tudy of which, though it is always to be po&s;tponed, is however not to be finally rejected; which though it cannot con|veniently come in to his pre&s;ent &s;cheme of life, it is intended &s;ome how or other to take up before death. This awful de|ception ari&s;es, partly from the bulk which the objects of time and &s;en&s;e acquire in our eyes by their nearne&s;s; while the invi&s;ible realities of eternity are but faintly di&s;cerned by a feeble faith, through a dim and di&s;tant medium; and partly from a totally fal&s;e idea of the nature of Chri&s;tianity, from a fatal fancy that we can repent at any future period, and that as amendment will always be in our own power, it will be time enough to think of reforming our life, when we &s;hould only think of clo&s;ing it.</P>
<P>But depend upon it that a heart long hardened, I do not mean by gro&s;s vices merely, but by a fondne&s;s for the world, by an habitual and exce&s;&s;ive indulgence in the plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e, is by no means in a favourable &s;tate to admit the light of divine
<PB N="227" REF="248">truth, or to receive the impre&s;&s;ions of divine grace. God indeed &s;ometimes &s;hows us by an act of his &s;overeignty, that this won|derful change, the conver&s;ion of a &s;inner's heart, may be produced without the in|tervention of human means, to &s;how that the work is HIS. But as this is not the way in which the Almighty u&s;ually deals with his creatures, it would be nearly as prepo&s;terous for men to act on this pre|&s;umption, as it would be to take no means for the pre&s;ervation of our lives, becau&s;e Je&s;us Chri&s;t rai&s;ed Lazarus from the dead.</P>

<P>Begin then with con&s;idering that re|ligion is a part, and the mo&s;t prominent part, in your &s;y&s;tem of in&s;truction. Do not communicate its principles in a random de&s;ultory way; nor &s;cantily &s;tint this bu&s;i|ne&s;s to only &s;uch &s;craps and remnants of time as may be ca&s;ually picked up from
<PB N="229" REF="250">the gleanings of other acquirements. <Q>Will you bring to God for a &s;acrifice that which co&s;ts you nothing?</Q> Let the be&s;t part of the day, which with mo&s;t people is the earlie&s;t part, be &s;teadily and invariably dedicated to this work by your children, before they are tired with their other &s;tudies, while the intellect is clear, the &s;pirits light, and the attention un|fatigued.</P>
<P>Confine not your in&s;tructions to mere verbal rituals and dry &s;y&s;tems; but in&s;truct them in a way which &s;hall intere&s;t their feelings; by lively images, and by a warm practical application of what they read to their own hearts and circum&s;tances. There &s;eems to be no good rea&s;on that while every other thing is to be made amu&s;ing, religion alone mu&s;t be dry and uninviting. Do not fancy that a thing is good merely becau&s;e it is dull. Why &s;hould not the mo&s;t entertaining powers of the mind be &s;upremely con&s;ecrated to that
<PB N="230" REF="251">&s;ubject which is mo&s;t worthy of their full exerci&s;e? The misfortune is, that religious learning is too often rather con&s;idered as an act of the memory than of the heart and feelings; and that children are turned over to the dry work of getting by rote as a ta&s;k that which they &s;hould get from example and animated conver&s;ation. Teach them rather, as their Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour taught, by intere&s;ting parables, which while they corrected the heart, left &s;ome exerci&s;e for the ingenuity in their &s;olu|tion, and for the feelings in their applica|tion. Teach, as HE taught, by &s;eizing on &s;urrounding objects, pa&s;&s;ing events, local circum&s;tances, peculiar characters, apt allu&s;ions, ju&s;t analogy, appropriate il|lu&s;tration. Call in all creation, animate and inanimate, to your aid, and accu&s;tom your young audience to
<Q><L>Find tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,</L>
<L>Sermons in &s;tones, and good in every thing.</L></Q>
<PB N="231" REF="252">Do, according to your mea&s;ure of ability, what the Holy Spirit which indited the Scriptures has done, always take the &s;en&s;i|bility of the learner into your account of the faculties which are to be worked upon. "For the doctrines of the Bible," as the profound and enlightened Bacon ob&s;erves, <Q>are not propo&s;ed to us in a naked logical form, but arrayed in the mo&s;t beautiful and &s;triking colours which creation affords.</Q> By tho&s;e illu&s;trations u&s;ed by Him <Q>who knew what was in man,</Q> and therefore be&s;t knew how to addre&s;s him, it was, that the unlettered audiences of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles were enabled both to comprehend and to reli&s;h doctrines, which would not readily have made their way to their under&s;tandings, had they not fir&s;t touched their hearts; and which would have found acce&s;s to neither the one nor the other, had they been delivered in dry, &s;chola&s;tic di&s;|qui&s;itions. Now tho&s;e audiences not being learned, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have
<PB N="232" REF="253">been nearly in the &s;tate of children, as to their receptive faculties, and to have required nearly the &s;ame &s;ort of in|&s;truction; that is, they were more capable of being affected with what was &s;imple, and touching, and lively, than what was elaborate, ab&s;tru&s;e, and unaffecting. Heaven and earth were made to furni&s;h their con|tributions when man was to make him wi&s;e unto &s;alvation. If that be the pure&s;t elo|quence which mo&s;t per&s;uades, then no eloquence is &s;o power&s;ul as that of Scrip|ture: and an intelligent Chri&s;tian teacher will be admoni&s;hed by the mode of Scrip|ture it&s;elf, how to communicate its truths with life and &s;pirit; <Q>while he is mu&s;ing the fire burns:</Q> that fire which will pre&s;erve him from an in&s;ipid and freezing mode of in&s;truction. He will moreover, like his great ma&s;ter, always carefully keep up a quick &s;en&s;e of the per&s;onal intere&s;t the pupil has in every religious in|&s;truction which is impre&s;&s;ed upon him.
<PB N="233" REF="254">He will teach as Paul prayed, <Q>with the &s;pirit and with the under&s;tanding al&s;o;</Q> and in imitating this great model he will nece&s;&s;arily avoid the oppo&s;ite faults of two different &s;orts of in&s;tructors; for while &s;ome of our divines of the higher cla&s;s have been too apt to preach as if mankind had only intellect, and the lower and more popular &s;ort as if they had only pa&s;&s;ions, do you borrow what is good from both, and addre&s;s your pupils as beings com|pounded of both under&s;tanding and af|fections <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The zeal and diligence with which the Bi&s;hop of London's weekly lectures have been attended by per|&s;ons of all ranks and de&s;criptions, but more e&s;pecially by that cla&s;s to whom this little work is addre&s;&s;ed, is a very promi&s;ing circum&s;tance for the age. And while one con&s;iders with plea&s;ure the advantages pe|culiarly to be derived by the young from &s;o intere&s;t|ing and animated an expo&s;ition of the go&s;pels, one is further led to rejoice at the countenance given by &s;uch high authority to the revival of that excellent, but too much neglected practice of lectures.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="255">
Fancy not that the Bible is too difficult and intricate to be pre&s;ented in its own naked form, and that it puzzles and be|wilders the youthful under&s;tanding. In all needful and indi&s;penb&s;ale points of knowledge the darkne&s;s of Scripture, as a great Chri&s;tian philo&s;opher <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Boyle.</NOTE> has ob&s;erved, <Q>is but a partial darkne&s;s, like that of Egypt, which benighted only the enemies of God while it left his children in clear day.</Q> And if it be really the appro|priate character of Scripture, as it tells us it&s;elf that it is, <Q>to enlighten the eyes of the blind,</Q> and <Q>to make wi&s;e the &s;imple,</Q> then is it as well calculated for the youthful and uninformed as for any other cla&s;s; and as it was never expected that the greater part of Chri&s;tians &s;hould be learned, &s;o is learning no <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> quali|fication for a common Chri&s;tian; for which rea&s;on Scripture truths are ex|pre&s;&s;ed with that clear and &s;imple evidence
<PB N="235" REF="256">adapted to the kind of a&s;&s;ent which they require. He who could bring an un|prejudiced heart and an unperverted will would bring to the Scriptures the be&s;t qualification for under&s;tanding and receiv|ing them. And though they contain things which the pupil cannot comprehend, (as what ancient poet, hi&s;torian, or orator does not,) the teacher may addre&s;s to him the words which Chri&s;t addre&s;&s;ed to Peter, <Q>What I do, thou knowe&s;t not now, but thou &s;halt know hereafter.</Q></P>
<P>Young people who have been taught religion in a dry and &s;uperficial way, who have had all its drudgeries and none of its plea&s;ures, will probably have acquired &s;o little reli&s;h for it, as to con&s;ider the con|tinued pro&s;ecution of their religious &s;tudies as a badge of their tutelage, as a mark that they are &s;till under &s;ubjection; and will look forward with impatience to the hour of their emancipation from the lec|tures on Chri&s;tianity. They will long for
<PB N="236" REF="257">the period when its le&s;&s;ons &s;hall cea&s;e to be delivered; will conclude that, having once attained &s;uch an age, and arrived at the required proficiency, the object will be accompli&s;hed and the labour at an end. But let not <HI>your</HI> children <Q>&s;o learn Chri&s;t.</Q> Apprize them that no &s;pecific day will ever arrive on which they &s;hall &s;ay, I <HI>have</HI> attained; but inform them, that every acqui&s;ition mu&s;t be followed up; knowledge mu&s;t be increa&s;ed; prejudices &s;ubdued; good habits rooted; evil ones eradicated; di&s;po&s;itions &s;trengthened; principles confirmed; till, going on from &s;trength to &s;trength, they come <Q>to the mea&s;ure of the &s;tature of the fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>But though &s;erious in&s;truction will not only be unintere&s;ting but irk&s;ome if con|veyed to youth in a mere didactic way, yet if their affections are &s;uitably engaged, their hearts, &s;o far from nece&s;&s;arily revolt|ing, as &s;ome in&s;i&s;t they will, often receive
<PB N="237" REF="258">the mo&s;t &s;olemn truths with alacrity. It is the manner which revolts them, and not the thing.</P>
<P>As it is notorious that men of wit and imagination have been the mo&s;t formidable enemies to Chri&s;tianity; while men, in whom tho&s;e talents have been con&s;ecrated to God, have been &s;ome of her mo&s;t u&s;eful champions, take particular care to pre&s;s that ardent and ever active power, the <HI>imagination,</HI> into the &s;ervice of religion; this bright and bu&s;y faculty will be lead|ing its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or into perpetual peril, and is an enemy of peculiar potency till it come to be employed in the cau&s;e of God. It is a lion, which though worldly prudence indeed may <HI>chain</HI> &s;o as to prevent outward mi&s;chief, yet the malignity remains within; but when &s;anctified by Chri&s;tianity, the imagination is a lion <HI>tamed;</HI> you have all the benefit of its &s;trength and its activity, dive&s;ted of its mi&s;chief. God never be|&s;towed that noble but re&s;tle&s;s faculty,
<PB N="238" REF="259">without intending it to be an in&s;trument of his own glory; though it has been too often &s;et up in rebellion again&s;t him; becau&s;e, in its youthful &s;tirrings, while all alive to evil it has not been &s;eized upon to fight for its rightful Sovereign, but was early enli&s;ted with little oppo&s;ition under the banners of the world, the fle&s;h, and the devil. Religion is the only &s;ubject in which, under the guidance of an holy and &s;ober-minded prudence, this di&s;cur&s;ive faculty can &s;afely &s;tretch its powers and expand its energies. But let it be remem|bered that it mu&s;t be a &s;ound and genuine Chri&s;tianity which can alone &s;o cha&s;ti&s;e and regulate the imagination, as to re&s;train it from tho&s;e errors and exce&s;&s;es into which a fal&s;e, a mi&s;taken, an irregular religion, has too often plunged its inju|dicious and ill-in&s;tructed profe&s;&s;or. To &s;ecure the imagination therefore on the &s;afe &s;ide, and, if I may change the meta|phor, to put it under the direction of
<PB N="239" REF="260">its true pilot in the &s;tormy voyage of life, is like engaging tho&s;e potent elements, the wind and tide, in your favour.</P>
<P>In your communications with young people, take care to convince them that as religion is not a bu&s;ine&s;s to be laid a&s;ide with the le&s;&s;on, &s;o neither is it a &s;ingle branch of duty; &s;ome detached thing, which like an art or a language is to be practi&s;ed &s;eparately, and to have its di&s;tinct periods and modes of operation. But let them under&s;tand, that common acts, by the &s;pirit in which they are to be performed, are to be made acts of religion: that Chri&s;tianity may be con&s;idered as having &s;omething of that influence over the conduct which external grace has over the manners; for as it is not the performance of &s;ome particular act which denominates any one to be graceful, grace being a &s;pirit diffu&s;ed through the whole &s;y&s;tem which animates every &s;entiment, and informs every action; as &s;he who has true per&s;onal grace has it uniformly, and
<PB N="240" REF="261">is not &s;ometimes awkward and &s;ometimes elegant; does not &s;ometimes lay it down and &s;ometimes take it up; &s;o religion is not an occa&s;ional act, but an indwelling principle, an inwrought habit, a pervading and informing &s;pirit, from which indeed every act derives all its life, and energy, and beauty.</P>
<P>Give them clear views of the broad di&s;crimination between practical religion and worldly morality. Show them that no good qualities are genuine but &s;uch as flow from the religion of Chri&s;t. Let them learn that the virtues which the better &s;ort of people, who yet are de&s;titute of true Chri&s;tianity, inculcate and practi&s;e, re&s;emble tho&s;e virtues which have the love of God for their motive, ju&s;t as counterfeit coin re&s;embles &s;terling gold; they may have, it is true, certain points of re&s;em|blance with the others; they may be bright and &s;hining; they have perhaps the image and the &s;uper&s;cription, but they ever want the true di&s;tingui&s;hing properties;
<PB N="241" REF="262">they want &s;terling value, purity, and weight. They may indeed pa&s;s current in the traffic of this world, but when brought to the touch&s;tone they will be found full of alloy; when weighed in the balance of the &s;anctuary, "they will be found wanting;" they will not &s;tand that final trial which is to &s;eparate the precious from the vile; they will not <Q>abide the day of <HI>his</HI> coming who is like a refiner's fire.</Q></P>
<P>One error into which even &s;ome good people are apt to fall, is that of endeavour|ing to deceive young minds by tempori&s;ing expedients. In order to allure them to become religious they exhibit fal&s;e, or faint, or inadequate views of Chri&s;t|ianity; and while they repre&s;ent it as it really is, as a life of &s;uperior happine&s;s and advantage, they conceal its difficulties, and like the Je&s;uitical Chine&s;e mi&s;&s;ionaries, extenuate, or &s;ink, or deny, &s;uch parts of it as are lea&s;t alluring. But be&s;ides that, the project fails with them as it did with the Je&s;uits, all fraud is bad; and a pious
<PB N="242" REF="263">fraud is a contradiction in terms which ought to be buried in the rubbi&s;h of papal de&s;olation.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of repre&s;enting to the young Chri&s;tian that it may be po&s;&s;ible by a prudent ingenuity at once to pur&s;ue, with equal ardour and &s;ucce&s;s, worldly fame and eternal glory, would it not be more hone&s;t to tell him fairly and unambiguou&s;ly that there are two di&s;tinct roads, between which there is a broad boundary line? that there are two irreconcileable intere&s;ts; that he mu&s;t for&s;ake the one if he would cleave to the other? that there are two &s;orts of characters at eternal variance? that nothing &s;hort of ab&s;olute deci&s;ion can make a confirmed Chri&s;tian? Point out the different &s;ort of promi&s;es annexed to the&s;e different &s;orts of characters. Con|fe&s;s in the language of Chri&s;t how the man of the world often obtains (and it is the natural cour&s;e of human things) the recompence he &s;edulou&s;ly &s;eeks. <Q>Verily I &s;ay unto you they have their reward.</Q>
<PB N="243" REF="264">Explain the beatitudes on the other hand, and unfold what kind of &s;pecific reward is there individually promi&s;ed to its concomi|tant virtue. Show your pupil that to that "poverty of &s;pirit" to which the kingdom of heaven is promi&s;ed, it would be in|con&s;i&s;tent to expect that the recompence of human commendation &s;hould be al&s;o attached: that to that "purity of heart" to which the beatific vi&s;ion is promi&s;ed, it would be unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e you can unite the prai&s;e of licentious wits, or the admiration of a catch club. The&s;e will be be&s;towed on their appropriate and cor|re&s;ponding merits. Do not inli&s;t them under fal&s;e colours. Different &s;orts of rewards are attached to different &s;orts of &s;ervices; and while you truly a&s;&s;ert that religious ways are <Q>ways of plea&s;antne&s;s, and all her paths are peace,</Q> take care that you do not lead them to depend too exclu&s;ively on worldly happine&s;s and earthly peace, for the&s;e make no part of the covenant; they may be &s;uperadded,
<PB N="244" REF="265">but they were never &s;tipulated in the contract.</P>
<P>But if, in order to attract the young to a religious cour&s;e, you di&s;ingenuou&s;ly conceal its difficulties, while you are enlarging upon its plea&s;ures, you will tempt them to di&s;tru&s;t the truth of Scripture it&s;elf. For what will they think, not only of a few detached texts, but of the general ca&s;t and colour of the Go&s;pel when contra&s;ted with your repre&s;entation of it? What notion will they conceive of "the &s;trait gate" and "narrow way?" of the amputation of a "right hand?" of the exci&s;ion of a "right eye?" of the other &s;trong meta|phors by which the Chri&s;tian warfare is &s;hadowed out? of "crucifying the "fle&s;h?" of "mortifying the old man?" of "dying unto &s;in?" of "overcoming "the world?" Do you not think their meek and compa&s;&s;ionate Saviour who died for your children loved them as well as you love them? And if this were his language, ought it not to be yours? It is the
<PB N="245" REF="266">language of true love; of that love with which a merciful God loved the world, when he &s;pared not his own Son. Do not then try to conceal from them, that the life of a Chri&s;tian is nece&s;&s;arily oppo&s;ite to the life of the world; and do not &s;eek, by a vain attempt at accommodation, to re|concile that difference which Chri&s;t him|&s;elf has pronounced to be irreconcileable.</P>
<P>May it not be partly owing to the want of a due introduction to the knowledge of the real nature and &s;pirit of religion, that &s;o many young Chri&s;tians, who &s;et out in a fair and flouri&s;hing way, decline and wither when they come to perceive the requi&s;itions of experimental Chri&s;tianity? requi&s;itions which they had not &s;u&s;pected of making any part of the plan.</P>
<P>People are no more to be cheated into religion than into learning. The &s;ame &s;pirit which influences your oath in a court of ju&s;tice &s;hould influence your di&s;cour&s;e in that court of equity&mdash;your family. Your children &s;hould be told the truth, the children &s;hould be told the truth, the
<PB N="246" REF="267">whole truth, and nothing but the truth. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to add, that it mu&s;t be done gradually and di&s;creetly. Ac|cu&s;tom them to rea&s;on by analogy. Explain to them that great <HI>worldly</HI> attainments are never made without great &s;acrifices; that the merchant cannot become rich without indu&s;try; the &s;tate&s;man eminent without labour; the &s;cholar learned without &s;tudy; the hero renowned without danger: would it not then, on human principles, be un|rea&s;onable to think that the Chri&s;tian alone &s;hould obtain a triumph without a warfare? the highe&s;t prize with the lowe&s;t exertions? an eternal crown without a pre&s;ent cro&s;s? and that heaven is the only reward which the idle may reckon upon? No: though &s;alvation "be the <HI>gift</HI> of God," yet it mu&s;t be <HI>"worked out."</HI> Convince your young friends, however, that in this ca&s;e the diffi|culty bears no proportion to the prize; though in one re&s;pect the point of re|&s;emblance fail, and that mo&s;t advantage|ou&s;ly for the Chri&s;tian; for while, even
<PB N="247" REF="268">by the mo&s;t probable means, which are the union of talents with diligence, no human pro&s;perity can be in&s;ured to the worldly candidate; while the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s|ful adventurer may fail by the fault of another; while the be&s;t concerted project of the &s;tate&s;man may be cru&s;hed; the brave&s;t hero lo&s;e the battle; the brighte&s;t genius fail of getting bread; and while, moreover, the plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from &s;ucce&s;s in the&s;e may be no &s;ooner ta&s;ted than it is poi&s;oned by a more pro&s;perous rival; the per&s;evering Chri&s;tian is &s;afe and certain of attaining <HI>his</HI> object; no misfortunes can defeat <HI>his</HI> hope; no competition can endanger <HI>his</HI> &s;ucce&s;s; for though another gain he will not lo&s;e. Nay, the &s;ucce&s;s of another, &s;o far from dimini&s;hing his gain, is an addition to it; the more he diffu&s;es, the richer he grows; and that mortal hour which cuts off for ever the hopes of worldly men, crowns and con&s;ummates his.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="269">
Beware at the &s;ame time of &s;etting up any act of &s;elf-denial or mortification as the <HI>procuring</HI> cau&s;e of &s;alvation. This would be a pre&s;umptuous project to <HI>pur|cha&s;e</HI> that eternal life which is declared to be the "free <HI>gift</HI> of God." This would be to &s;end your children not to the go&s;pel to learn their Chri&s;tianity, but to the Monks and A&s;cetics of the middle ages; it would be &s;ending them to Peter the Hermit, and the holy fathers of the De&s;ert, and not to Peter the Apo&s;tle and his Divine Ma&s;ter. Mortification is not the price; it is nothing more than the di&s;|cipline of a foul of which &s;in is the di&s;ea&s;e, the diet pre&s;cribed by the great phy&s;ician. Without this guard the young devout Chri&s;tian would be led to fancy that ab&s;tinence, pilgrimage, and penance might be adopted as the cheap &s;ub&s;titute for the &s;ubdued de&s;ire and the obedient will; and would be almo&s;t in as much danger on the one hand of &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s ari&s;ing
<PB N="249" REF="270">from au&s;terities and mortification, as &s;he would be on the other from &s;elf-gratifica|tion in the indulgences of the world. And while you carefully impre&s;s on her the nece&s;&s;ity of living a life of &s;trict obe|dience if &s;he would plea&s;e God, do not neglect to remind her al&s;o that a complete renunciation of her own performances as a ground of merit, <HI>purcha&s;ing</HI> the favour of God by their own intrin&s;ic worth, is included in that obedience.</P>
<P>Though it be impo&s;&s;ible here to enume|rate all tho&s;e Chri&s;tian virtues which &s;hould be impre&s;&s;ed in the progre&s;s of a Chri&s;tian education, yet in this connection I cannot forbear mentioning one which more immediately grows out of the &s;ub|ject; and to remark that the principle which &s;hould be the invariable concomitant of all in&s;truction, and e&s;pecially of religious in&s;truction, is humility. As this temper is inculcated in every page of the Go&s;pel; as it is deducible from every precept and every action of Chri&s;t; that is a
<PB N="250" REF="271">&s;ufficient intimation that it &s;hould be made to grow out of every &s;tudy, that it &s;hould be grafted on every acqui&s;ition. It is the turning point, the leading principle indi|cative of the very genius of Chri&s;tianity. This cha&s;ti&s;ing quality &s;hould therefore be con&s;tantly made in education to operate as the only counteraction of that <Q>know|ledge which puffeth up.</Q> Youth &s;hould be taught that as humility is the di&s;cri|minating characteri&s;tic of our religion, that therefore a proud Chri&s;tian, a haughty di&s;ciple of a crucified Ma&s;ter, furni&s;hes per|haps a &s;tronger oppo&s;ition in terms than the whole compa&s;s of language can exhibit. Humility being the appropriate grace of Chri&s;tianity, is what makes Chri&s;tian and Pagan virtues <HI>e&s;&s;entially</HI> different. The virtues of the Romans, for in&s;tance, were obviou&s;ly founded in pride; as a proof of this, they had not even a word in their copions language to expre&s;s humility, but what was u&s;ed in a bad &s;en&s;e, and conveyed the idea of meanne&s;s or vilene&s;s. Chri&s;t|ianity
<PB N="251" REF="272">&s;o &s;tands on its own &s;ingle ground, is &s;o far from a&s;&s;imilating it&s;elf to the &s;pirit of other religions, that, unlike the Roman Emperor, who though he would not become a Chri&s;tian, yet ordered that the image of Chri&s;t &s;hould be &s;et up in the Pantheon with tho&s;e of the heathen gods, and be wor&s;hipped in common with them, Chri&s;tianity not only rejects all &s;uch partner&s;hips with other religions, but it pulls down their images, defaces their temples, founds its own exi&s;tence on the ruins of &s;purious religions and &s;purious virtues, and will be every thing when it is admitted to be any thing.</P>
<P>Will it be going too much out of the way to ob&s;erve, that Chri&s;tian Britain retaliates upon Pagan Rome? For if the former u&s;ed humility in a bad &s;en&s;e, has not the latter learnt to u&s;e pride in a good one? May we without impertinence ven|ture to remark, that, in the deliberations of as honourable and upright political a&s;&s;emblies as ever adorned, or, under Provi|dence,

The pane|gyri&s;t of the battle of Marathon, of Plataea, or of Zama, might with propriety &s;peak of a "proud day," or a "proud event," or a "proud &s;ucce&s;s." But &s;urely the Chri&s;tian encomia&s;ts of the battle of the Nile may, from their abundance, &s;elect an epithet better appropriated to &s;uch a victory&mdash;a victory which, by pre&s;erving Europe, has perhaps pre&s;erved that religion which &s;ets its foot on the very neck of pride, and in which the conqueror him&s;elf, even in the fir&s;t ardors of triumph, forgot not to a&s;cirbe the victory to ALMIGHTY GOD. Let us leave to the enemy both the term and the thing; arrogant words being the only weapons in which we mu&s;t ever veil to their decided &s;uperiority.</P>

Above all things then you &s;hould beware that your pupils do not take up with a vague, general, and undefined religion; but look to it that their Chri&s;tianity be really the religion of Chri&s;t. In&s;tead of &s;lurring over the doctrines of the cro&s;s, as di&s;reputable appendages to our religion, which are to be got over as well as we can, but which are never to be dwelt upon, take care to make the&s;e your fundamental articles. Do not explain away the&s;e doctrines, and by &s;ome elegant periphra&s;is <HI>hint</HI> at a Saviour, in&s;tead of making him the foundation &s;tone of your religion. Do not convey primary, and plain, and awful, and indi&s;pen&s;able truths elliptically, I mean as &s;omething that is to be under|&s;tood without being expre&s;&s;ed; nor &s;tudy fa&s;hionable circumlocutions to avoid names and things on which our &s;alvation hangs, in order to prevent your di&s;cour&s;e from being offen&s;ive.

<PB N="254" REF="275">imbibe a di&s;ta&s;te for plain &s;criptural lan|guage; and the Scriptures them&s;elves are &s;o little in u&s;e with a certain fa&s;hionable cla&s;s of readers, that when the doctrines and language of the Bible occa&s;ionally occur in other authors, they pre&s;ent a &s;ort of novelty and peculiarity which offend; and &s;uch readers as di&s;u&s;e the Bible are apt to call that preci&s;e and puritanical, which is in fact &s;ound and &s;criptural. Nay, it has &s;everal times happened to the author to hear per&s;ons of &s;en&s;e and learning ridicule in&s;ulated &s;entiments and expre&s;|&s;ions that have fallen in their way, which they would have treated with decent re&s;pect had they known them to be, as they really were, texts of Scripture. This ob|&s;ervation is made with a view to enforce the importance of early communicating re|ligious knowledge, and of infu&s;ing an early ta&s;te for Scripture phra&s;eology.</P>
<P>The per&s;ons in que&s;tion are apt to acquire a kind of Pagan Chri&s;tianity, which ju&s;t enables them to hear with complacency
<PB N="255" REF="276">of the "Deity," of a "fir&s;t cau&s;e," and of "con&s;cience." Nay, &s;ome may even go &s;o far as to talk of <Q>the Founder of our religion,</Q> of the "Author of Chri&s;t|ianity," in general terms, as they would talk of the prophet of Arabia, or the law|giver of China, of Athens, or of the Jews. But their refined ears revolt not a little at the unadorned name of Chri&s;t; and even the naked and unqualified term of our Saviour, or Redeemer, carries with it a queeri&s;h, inelegant, not to &s;ay a &s;u&s;picious &s;ound. They will expre&s;s a &s;erious di&s;|approbation of what is wrong under the moral term of <HI>vice,</HI> or the foren&s;ic term of <HI>crime;</HI> but they are apt to think that the Scripture term of <HI>&s;in</HI> has &s;omething fana|tical in it: and, while they di&s;cover a great re&s;pect for morality, they do not much reli&s;h holine&s;s which is indeed the &s;pecific morality of a Chri&s;tian.

<PB N="256" REF="277">more correct in &s;ome individual practice; but the expre&s;&s;ion of a total change of heart, they would &s;tigmatize as the very &s;hibboleth of a &s;ect, though it is the lan|guage of a Liturgy they affect to admire, and of a go&s;pel which they profe&s;s to receive.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XII.</HI> Hints &s;ugge&s;ted for furni&s;hing young per&s;ons with a &s;cheme of prayer.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE who are aware of the ine&s;timable value of prayer them&s;elves, will naturally be anxious not only that this duty &s;hould be earne&s;tly inculcated on their children, but that they &s;hould be taught it in the be&s;t manner; and <HI>&s;uch</HI> parents need little per&s;ua&s;ion or council on the &s;ubject. Yet children of decent and orderly (I will not &s;ay of &s;trictly religious) families are often &s;o &s;uperficially in&s;tructed in this important bu&s;ine&s;s, that it is not unu&s;ual when they are a&s;ked what prayers they u&s;e, to an&s;wer, <Q>the Lord's Prayer and the <HI>Creed.</HI></Q> And even &s;ome who are better taught, are not always made to under&s;tand with &s;ufficient clearne&s;s the
<PB N="258" REF="279">&s;pecific di&s;tinction between the two; that the one is the confe&s;&s;ion of their <HI>faith,</HI> and the other the model for their <HI>&s;up|plications.</HI> By this confu&s;ed and indi&s;tinct beginning, they &s;et out with a perplexity in their ideas, which is not always com|pletely di&s;entangled in more advanced life.</P>
<P>An intelligent mother will &s;eize the fir&s;t occa&s;ion which the child's opening under|&s;tanding &s;hall allow, for making a little cour&s;e of lectures on the Lord's Prayer, taking every divi&s;ion or &s;hort &s;entence &s;eparately; for each furni&s;hes valuable ma|terials for a di&s;tinct lecture. The child &s;hould be led gradually through every part of this divine compo&s;ition; &s;he &s;hould be taught to break it into all the regular divi&s;ions, into which indeed it &s;o naturally re&s;olves it&s;elf. She &s;hould be made to comprehend one by one each of its &s;hort but weighty &s;entences, to amplify and &s;pread them out for the purpo&s;e of better under&s;tanding them, not in their mo&s;t
<PB N="259" REF="280">exten&s;ive, but in their mo&s;t &s;imple and obvious meaning. For in tho&s;e con|den&s;ed and &s;ub&s;tantial expre&s;&s;ions, every word is an ingot and will bear beating out; &s;o that the teacher's difficulty will not &s;o much be what &s;he &s;hall &s;ay as what &s;he &s;hall &s;uppre&s;s; &s;o abundant is the expo&s;itory matter which this &s;uccinct pattern &s;ugge&s;ts.</P>
<P>When the child has a pretty good con|ception of the meaning of each divi&s;ion, &s;he &s;hould then be made to ob&s;erve the connection, relation, and dependence of the &s;everal parts of this prayer one upon another; for there is great method and connection in it. We pray that the "kingdom of God may come," as the be&s;t means to "hallow his name;" and that by us, the obedient &s;ubjects of this kingdom, "his will may be done." A judicious interpreter will ob&s;erve how logically and con&s;equently one clau&s;e grows out of another, though &s;he will u&s;e neither
<PB N="260" REF="281">the word logical nor con&s;equence: for all explanations &s;hould be made in the mo&s;t plain and familiar terms, it being words, and not things, which commonly perplex children, if, as it &s;ometimes happens, the teacher, though not wanting &s;en&s;e, want per&s;picuity and &s;implicity.</P>
<P>The young per&s;on, from being made a complete mi&s;tre&s;s of this &s;hort compo|&s;ition, (which as it is to be her guide and model through life, too much pains cannot be be&s;towed on it,) will have a clearer conception, not only of its individual con|tents, but of prayer in general, than many ever attain though their memory has been perhaps loaded with long and unexplained forms, which they have been accu&s;tomed to &s;wallow in the lump without &s;crutiny. Prayer &s;hould not be &s;o &s;wallowed. It is a regular pre&s;cription, which &s;hould &s;tand analy&s;is and examination: it is not a charm, the &s;ucce&s;sful operation of which depends on your blindly taking it, without
<PB N="261" REF="282">knowing what is in it, and in which the good you receive is promoted by your ignorance.</P>
<P>I would have it under&s;tood that by the&s;e little comments, I do not mean that the child &s;hould be put to learn dry, and to her unintelligible expo&s;itions; and here I mu&s;t remark in general, that the teacher is &s;ometimes apt to relieve her&s;elf at the child's expence, by loading the <HI>memory</HI> of a little creature on occa&s;ions in which far other faculties &s;hould be put in exerci&s;e. The child her&s;elf &s;hould be made to furni&s;h a good part of the commentary by her an&s;wers; in which an&s;wers &s;he will be much a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the judgment the teacher u&s;es in her manner of que&s;tioning. And the youthful under&s;tanding, when its powers are properly &s;et at work, will &s;oon &s;trengthen by exerci&s;e &s;o as to furni&s;h rea&s;onable if not very correct an&s;wers.</P>
<P>Written forms of prayer are not only u&s;eful and proper, but indi&s;pen&s;ably ne|ce&s;&s;ary. But I will hazard the remark,
<PB N="262" REF="283">that if children are thrown <HI>exclu&s;ively</HI> on the be&s;t forms, if they are made to commit them to memory like a copy of ver&s;es, and to repeat them in a dry, cu&s;tomary way, they will produce little effect on their minds. They will not under&s;tand what they repeat, if we do not early open to them the important <HI>&s;cheme</HI> of prayer. Without &s;uch an elementary introduction to this duty, they will afterwards be either ignorant or enthu&s;ia&s;ts, or both. We &s;hould give them <HI>knowledge</HI> before we can expect them to make much progre&s;s in <HI>piety,</HI> and as a due preparative to it: Chri&s;tian in&s;truction in this re&s;embling the &s;un, who, in the cour&s;e of his communica|tions, gives light before he gives heat. And to excite a &s;pirit of devotion without infu&s;ing that knowledge out of which it is to grow, is practically reviving the popi&s;h maxim, that Ignorance is the mother of Devotion, and virtually adopting the popi&s;h rule, of praying in an unknown tongue.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="284">
Children, let me again ob&s;erve, will not attend to their prayers if they do not under&s;tand them; and they will not un|der&s;tand them, if they are not taught to analy&s;e, to di&s;&s;ect them, to know their component parts, and to methodi&s;e them.</P>
<P>It is not enough to teach them to con|&s;ider prayer under the general idea that it is an application to God for what they want, and an acknowledgment for what they have. This, though true in the gro&s;s, is not &s;ufficiently preci&s;e and correct. They &s;hould learn to define and to arrange all the different parts of prayer. And as a preparative to prayer it&s;elf, they &s;hould be impre&s;&s;ed with as clear an idea as the nature of the &s;ubject admits, of <Q>HIM with whom they have to do.</Q> His omnipre&s;ence is perhaps of all his attri|butes, that of which we may make the fir&s;t practical u&s;e. Every head of prayer is founded on &s;ome great &s;criptural truths, which truths the little analy&s;is here &s;ug|ge&s;ted
<PB N="264" REF="285">will materially a&s;&s;i&s;t to fix in their minds.</P>
<P>On the knowledge that "God is," that he is an infinitely holy Being, and that <Q>he is the rewarder of all them that diligently &s;eek him,</Q> will be grounded the fir&s;t part of prayer, which is <HI>adoration.</HI> The creature devoting it&s;elf to the Creator, or <HI>&s;elf-dedication,</HI> next pre&s;ents it&s;elf. And if they are fir&s;t taught that important truth, that as needy creatures they want help, which may be done by &s;ome ea&s;y analogy, they will ea&s;ily be led to under&s;tand how naturally <HI>petition</HI> forms a mo&s;t con&s;iderable branch of prayer: and divine grace being among the things for which they are to petition, this naturally &s;ugge&s;ts to the mind the doctrine of the influences of the &s;pirit. And when to this is added the conviction, which will be readily worked into an ingenuous mind, that as offending creatures they want pardon, the nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>confe&s;&s;ion</HI> will ea&s;ily be made intelligible
<PB N="265" REF="286">to them. But they &s;hould be brought to under&s;tand that it mu&s;t not be &s;uch a general and vague confe&s;&s;ion as awakens no &s;en&s;e of per&s;onal humiliation, as excites no recollection of their own more peculiar and individual faults. But it mu&s;t be a confe&s;&s;ion founded on &s;elf-knowledge, which is it&s;elf to ari&s;e out of the practice of &s;elf-examination; for want of this &s;ort of di&s;criminating habit, a well-meaning but ill-in&s;tructed girl may catch her&s;elf con|fe&s;&s;ing the &s;ins of &s;ome other per&s;on, and omitting tho&s;e which are more e&s;pecially her own. On the gladne&s;s of heart natural to youth, it will be le&s;s difficult to impre&s;s the delightful duty of <HI>thank&s;|giving,</HI> which forms &s;o con&s;iderable a branch of prayer. In this they &s;hould be habituated to recapitulate not only their general, but to enumerate their peculiar, daily, and incidental mercies, in the &s;ame &s;pecific manner as they &s;hould have been taught to detail their <HI>wants</HI> in the petition|ary, and their <HI>faults</HI> in the confe&s;&s;ional
<PB N="266" REF="287">part. The &s;ame warmth of feeling which will more readily di&s;po&s;e them to expre&s;s their gratitude to God in thank&s;giving, will al&s;o lead them more gladly to expre&s;s their love to their parents and friends, by adopting another indi&s;pen&s;able, and to an affectionate heart, plea&s;ing part of prayer, which is <HI>interce&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>When they have been made, by a plain and per&s;picuous mode of in&s;truction, fully to under&s;tand the different nature of all the&s;e; and when they clearly comprehend that <HI>adoration, &s;elf-dedication, confe&s;&s;ion, petition, thank&s;giving,</HI> and <HI>interce&s;&s;ion,</HI> are di&s;tinct heads, which mu&s;t not be involved in each other, you may exemplify the rules by pointing out to them the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ive branches in any well written form. And they will ea&s;ily di&s;cern, that a&s;cription of glory to that God to whom we owe &s;o much, and on whom we &s;o entirely de|pend, is the conclu&s;ion into which a Chri&s;tian's prayer will re&s;olve it&s;elf. It is hardly needful to remind the teacher that
<PB N="267" REF="288">our truly Scriptural Liturgy invariably furni&s;hes the example of pre&s;enting <HI>every</HI> reque&s;t in the name of the great Mediator. In the Liturgy too they will meet with the be&s;t exemplifications of prayers, exhibit|ing &s;eparate &s;pecimens of each of the di&s;tinct heads we have been &s;ugge&s;ting.</P>
<P>But in order that the minds of young per&s;ons may, without labour or difficulty, be gradually brought into &s;uch a &s;tate of preparation as to be benefited by &s;uch a little cour&s;e of lectures as we have re|commended; they &s;hould, from the time when they were fir&s;t able to read, have been employing them&s;elves at their lei&s;ure hours, in laying in a &s;tore of provi&s;ion for their pre&s;ent demands. And here the memory may be employed to good purpo&s;e; for being the fir&s;t faculty which is ripened, and which is indeed perfected when the others are only begin|ning to unfold them&s;elves, this is an intimation of Providence that it &s;hould be the fir&s;t &s;eized on for the be&s;t u&s;es. It
<PB N="268" REF="289">&s;hould therefore be devoted to lay in a &s;tock of the more ea&s;y and devotional parts of Scripture. The P&s;alms alone are an inexhau&s;tible &s;tore-hou&s;e of rich materials. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This will be &s;o far from &s;poiling the cheer|fulne&s;s, or impeding the plea&s;ures of childhood, that the author knows a little girl who, before &s;he was &s;even years old, had learnt the whole P&s;alter through a &s;econd time; and that without any diminution of uncommon gaiety of &s;pirits, or any interference with the elegant acquirements &s;uited to her &s;tation.</NOTE> Children who&s;e minds have been early well furni&s;hed from the&s;e, will be com|petent at nine or ten years old to produce from them, and to &s;elect with no con|temptible judgment, &s;uitable examples of all the parts of prayer; and will be able to extract and appropriate texts under each re&s;pective head, &s;o as to exhibit, without help, complete &s;pecimens of every part of prayer. By confining them entirely to the &s;en&s;e, and nearly to the words of Scripture, they will be pre&s;erved from
<PB N="269" REF="290">enthu&s;ia&s;m, from irregularity and conceit. By being obliged continually to apply for them&s;elves, they will get a habit in all their difficulties, of <Q>&s;earching the Scrip|tures,</Q> which may be u&s;eful to them on future and more trying occa&s;ions. But I would <HI>confine</HI> them to the Bible; for were they allowed with equal freedom to ran&s;ack other books with a view to get helps to embelli&s;h their little com|po&s;itions, or rather compilations, they might be tempted to pa&s;s off for their own what they pick up from others, which might tend at once to make them both vain and deceitful. This is a tempta|tion to which they are too much laid open when they get commended for any pilfered pa&s;&s;age with which they adorn their little themes and letters. But in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance there is no danger of any &s;imilar deception, for there is &s;uch a &s;acred &s;ignature &s;tamped on every Scripture phra&s;e, that the owner's name can never
<PB N="270" REF="291">be defaced or torn off from the goods, either by fraud or violence.</P>
<P>It would be well, if in tho&s;e P&s;alms which children were fir&s;t directed to get by heart, an eye were had to this their future application; and that they were employed, but without any intimation of your &s;ub&s;equent de&s;ign, in learning &s;uch as may be be&s;t turned to this account. In the 139th the fir&s;t great truth to be imprinted on the young heart, as was before ob&s;erved, is unfolded with &s;uch a mixture of maje&s;tic grandeur, and &s;uch an intere&s;ting variety of intimate and local circum&s;tances, as is likely to &s;eize on the quick and lively feelings of youth. The awful idea that that Being whom &s;he is taught to reverence, is not only <HI>in general</HI> "acquainted with all her ways," but that <Q>he is about her path, and about her bed,</Q> be&s;tows &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of real and pre&s;ent exi&s;tence on <HI>him</HI> of whom &s;he is apt to conceive as having his di&s;tant
<PB N="271" REF="292">habitation only in Heaven, as will help her to realize the &s;en&s;e of his actual pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>The 103d P&s;alm will open to the mind rich and abundant &s;ources of expre&s;&s;ion for gratitude and thank&s;giving, and it includes &s;piritual as well as temporal favours. It illu&s;trates the mercies of God by familiar and dome&s;tic images, of &s;uch peculiar tenderne&s;s and endearment, as are calculated to &s;trike upon every chord of filial fondne&s;s in the heart of an af|fectionate child. The 51&s;t &s;upplies an infinite variety of matter in whatever relates to confe&s;&s;ion of &s;in, or to &s;uppli|cation for the aids of the &s;pirit. The 23d abounds with captivating expre&s;&s;ions of the protecting goodne&s;s of their heavenly Father, conveyed by pa&s;toral imagery of uncommon &s;weetne&s;s: in &s;hort the greater part of the&s;e beautiful compo&s;itions over|flow with materials for every head of prayer.</P>
<P>The child who, while &s;he was engaged in learning the&s;e Scriptures, was not aware
<PB N="272" REF="293">that there was any &s;pecific object to be an&s;wered by it, will afterwards feel an unexpected plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from the appli|cation of her petty labours, when &s;he is called to draw out from her little trea|&s;ury of knowledge the &s;tores &s;he has been collecting; and will be plea&s;ed to find that without any fre&s;h application to &s;tudy, for &s;he is now obliged to exerci&s;e a higher faculty than memory, &s;he has lying ready in her mind, the materials with which &s;he is now called upon to work. Her judg|ment mu&s;t be &s;et about &s;electing one or two, or more texts which &s;hall con|tain the &s;ub&s;tance of every &s;pecific head of prayer before noticed; and it will be a farther exerci&s;e to her under&s;tand|ing to concatenate the detached parts into one regular whole, occa&s;ionally vary|ing the arrangement as &s;he likes; that is, changing the order, &s;ometimes begin|ning with invocation, &s;ometimes with con|fe&s;&s;ion; &s;ometimes dwelling longer on one part, &s;ometimes on another. As the
<PB N="273" REF="294">hard&s;hips of a religious Sunday are often &s;o pathetically pleaded, as making one of the heavy burdens of religion; and as the friends of religion are &s;o often called upon to mitigate its rigours, might not &s;uch an exerci&s;e as has been here &s;ugge&s;ted help to vary its occupations?</P>
<P>The habits of the pupil being thus early formed, her memory, attention, and intellect being bent in a right direction, and the exerci&s;e invariably maintained, may one not rea&s;onably hope that her <HI>affections</HI> al&s;o, through divine grace, may become intere&s;ted in the work, till &s;he will be enabled <Q>to pray with the &s;pirit and with the under&s;tanding al&s;o?</Q> She will now be qualified to u&s;e a well-compo&s;ed form with &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and ad|vantage; for &s;he will now u&s;e it not mechanically, but rationally. That which before appeared to her a mere ma&s;s of good words, will now appear a &s;ignificant compo&s;ition, exhibiting variety, and order,
<PB N="274" REF="295">and beauty; and &s;he will have the farther advantage of being enabled by her im|proved judgment to di&s;tingui&s;h and &s;elect for her own purpo&s;e &s;uch as are more judicious and more &s;criptural.</P>
