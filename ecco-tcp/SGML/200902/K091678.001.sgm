<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Work was begun a great number of years pa&s;t, when the empire of <HI>Great Britain</HI> was entire, and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed the northern part of the New World with envied &s;plen|dor. At that period I formed a de&s;ign of collecting materials for a partial Hi&s;tory of its Animals; and with true pains, by various corre&s;pondencies, made far greater progre&s;s in my plan than my mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations had framed. Above a century ago, an illu&s;trious predece&s;&s;or in the line of Natural Hi&s;tory, who as greatly exceeded me in abilities as he did in zeal, meditated a voyage to the New World, in pur&s;uance of a &s;imilar de&s;ign. The gentleman alluded to was FRANCIS WILLUGHBY, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who died in 1672, on the point of put|ting his de&s;ign in execution. Emulous of &s;o illu&s;trious an example, I took up the object of his pur&s;uit; but my many relative duties forbade me from carrying it to the length con|ceived by that great and good man. What he would have per|formed, from an actual in&s;pection in the native country of the &s;everal &s;ubjects under con&s;ideration, I mu&s;t content my&s;elf to do, in a le&s;s perfect manner, from pre&s;erved &s;pecimens tran&s;mit|ted to me; and offer to the world their Natural Hi&s;tory, taken from gentlemen or writers who have paid no &s;mall attention to their manners.</P>
<P>Let me repeat, that this Work was de&s;igned as a &s;ketch of the Zoology of <HI>North America.</HI> I thought I had a right to
<PB REF="4">
the attempt, at a time I had the honor of calling my&s;elf a fel|low-&s;ubject with that re&s;pectable part of our former great em|pire; but when the fatal and humiliating hour arrived, which deprived <HI>Britain</HI> of power, &s;trength, and glory, I felt the morti|fication which mu&s;t &s;trike every feeling individual at lo&s;ing his little &s;hare in the boa&s;t of ruling over half of the New World. I could no longer &s;upport my clame of entitling my&s;elf its humble Zoologi&s;t: yet, unwilling to fling away all my labors, do now deliver them to the Public under the title of the ARCTIC ZOOLOGY. I added to them a de&s;cription of the Quadrupeds and Birds of the north of <HI>Europe</HI> and of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> from latitude 60 to the farthe&s;t known parts of the <HI>Arctic</HI> World, together with tho&s;e of <HI>Kamt&s;chatka,</HI> and the parts of <HI>America</HI> vi&s;ited in the la&s;t voyage of the illu&s;trious COOK. The&s;e additional parts I have flung into the form of an Appendix to each ge|nus, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by a <HI>fleur de lis;</HI> and the &s;pecies by literal in&s;tead of numeral marks, which di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e of <HI>North America.</HI> The&s;e will, in a great mea&s;ure, &s;hew the dilatation of Quadrupeds and Birds, and the migrations of the feathered tribe, within part of the northern hemi&s;phere.</P>
<P>I have, whenever I could get information, given their re&s;pec|tive re&s;idences, as well as migrations to far more northern parts, to &s;hew to what very remote places the Author of Na|ture hath impelled them to retire, to breed in &s;ecurity. This wi&s;e provi&s;ion pre&s;erves the &s;pecies entire, and enables them to return by myriads, to contribute to the food or luxuries of &s;outhern climates. Whatever is wanting in the <HI>American</HI> part, I may fore&s;ee, will in time be amply &s;upplied. The powers of literature will &s;oon ari&s;e, with the other &s;trengths of the new empire, and &s;ome native Naturali&s;t give perfection to that
<PB REF="5">
part of the undertaking, by ob&s;ervations formed on the &s;pot, in the u&s;es, manners, and migrations. Should, at pre&s;ent, no one be inclined to take the pen out of my hand, remarks from the other &s;ide of the <HI>Atlantic,</HI> from any gentlemen of conge|nial &s;tudies, will add peculiar plea&s;ure to a favorite pur&s;uit, and be gratefully received.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t reckon among my mo&s;t valued corre&s;pondents on the New Continent, Doctor ALEXANDER GARDEN<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Now re&s;ident in <HI>London.</HI></NOTE>, who, by his long re&s;idence in <HI>South Carolina,</HI> was enabled to commu|nicate to me variety of curious remarks and &s;ubjects, as will appear in the following pages.</P>
<P>To the rich mu&s;eum of <HI>American</HI> Birds, pre&s;erved by Mrs. ANNA BLACKBURN, of <HI>Orford,</HI> near <HI>Warrington,</HI> I am indebted for the opportunity of de&s;cribing almo&s;t every one known in the provinces of <HI>Jer&s;ey, New York,</HI> and <HI>Connecticut.</HI> They were &s;ent over to that Lady by her brother, the late Mr. <HI>A&s;hton Blackburn;</HI> who added to the &s;kill and zeal of a &s;port&s;|man, the mo&s;t pertinent remarks on the &s;pecimens he col|lected for his worthy and philo&s;ophical &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>In the foremo&s;t rank of the philo&s;ophers of the Old Conti|nent, from who&s;e corre&s;pondence I have benefited, I mu&s;t place Doctor PETER SIM. PALLAS, at pre&s;ent Profe&s;&s;or of Natural Hi&s;tory in the &s;ervice of the illu&s;trious EMPRESS of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia:</HI> he not only favored me with the fulle&s;t remarks on the Zoological part of that va&s;t empire, mo&s;t of which he formed from actual travel and ob&s;ervation, but collected for my u&s;e various other remarks from the manu&s;cripts of his predece&s;&s;ors; e&s;pecially what related to <HI>Kamt&s;chatka</HI> from tho&s;e
<PB REF="6">
of STELLER; which have a&s;&s;i&s;ted me in the hi&s;tory of parts hitherto but very &s;lightly under&s;tood.</P>
<P>From the corre&s;pondency and labors of Mr. EBERH. AUG. WILLIAM ZIMMERMAN, Profe&s;&s;or of Mathematics at <HI>Brun&s;|wic,</HI> I have collected mo&s;t uncommon in&s;truction. His <HI>Specimen Zoologiae Geographicae Quadrupedum</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A quarto in <HI>Latin,</HI> containing 685 pages, printed at <HI>Leyden,</HI> 1777; &s;old in <HI>London</HI> by Mr. <HI>Faden,</HI> Geographer, <HI>St. Martin's Lane.</HI></NOTE> is a work which gives a full view of the cla&s;s of Quadrupeds, and the progre&s;s they have made in &s;preading over the face of the earth, according to cli|mates and latitudes. Their limits are de&s;cribed, in general, with uncommon accuracy. Much is &s;aid of the climates them&s;elves; of the varieties of mankind; of the effects of heat and cold on them and other animals. A mo&s;t curious map is joined to the work, in which is given the name of every animal in its proper cli|mate; &s;o that a view of the whole Quadruped creation is placed before one's eyes, in a manner perfectly new and in&s;tructive<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A new edition of the map has been lately publi&s;hed by the learned Author; the geographical part is corrected according to the late voyages of Captain COOK, and great additions made to the zoological part. An explanation is given, in the third volume of the <HI>Zoologia Geographica,</HI> lately publi&s;hed in <HI>German</HI> by the Author.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To the following foreigners, di&s;tingui&s;hed for their literary knowlege, I mu&s;t pay my be&s;t acknowlegement for variety of mo&s;t u&s;eful communications: Doctor ANDERS SPARMAN, of <HI>Stockholm;</HI> Doctor CHARLES P. THUNBERG, of <HI>Up&s;al;</HI> Mr. AND. J. RETZIUS, Profe&s;&s;or of Natural Hi&s;tory at <HI>Lund;</HI> Mr. MARTIN THRANE BRUNNICH, Profe&s;&s;or of Natural Hi&s;tory, and Mr. OTHO MULLER, Author of the <HI>Zoologia Danica,</HI> both of <HI>Copenhagen:</HI> and let me add my great obligations to the la|bors of the Reverend Mr. OTTO FABRICIUS, for his mo&s;t fini&s;hed <HI>Fauna</HI> of <HI>Greenland.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="7">To many of my countrymen my be&s;t thanks are due for literary a&s;&s;i&s;tances. Sir JOSEPH BANKS, Baronet, will, I hope, accept my thanks for the free admittance to tho&s;e parts of his cabinet which more immediately related to the &s;ubject of the following &s;heets.</P>
<P>To Sir ASHTON LEVER, Knight, I am highly indebted, for the more intimate and clo&s;er examination of his trea&s;ures than was allowed to the common vi&s;itors of his mo&s;t magnificent mu&s;eum.</P>
<P>To Mr. SAMUEL HEARN, the great explorer by land of the <HI>Icy Sea,</HI> I cannot but &s;end my mo&s;t particular thanks, for his liberal communication of many zoological remarks, made by him on the bold and fatiguing adventure he undertook from <HI>Hud&s;on's Bay</HI> to the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of the north on that &s;ide.</P>
<P>Mr. ANDREW GRAHAM, long a re&s;ident in <HI>Hud&s;on's Bay,</HI> obliged me with numbers of ob&s;ervations on the country, and the u&s;e of multitudes of &s;pecimens of animals tran&s;mitted by him to the late mu&s;eum of the Royal Society, at the in&s;tance of that liberal patron of &s;cience, my re&s;pected friend the Ho|norable DAINES BARRINGTON.</P>
<P>Let me clo&s;e the li&s;t with acknowleging the great a&s;&s;i&s;tance I have found in the Synop&s;is of Birds by Mr. JOHN LATHAM; a work now brought almo&s;t to a conclu&s;ion, and which contains a far greater number of de&s;criptions than any which has gone before. This is owing not only to the a&s;&s;iduity of the Au|thor, but al&s;o to the peculiar &s;pirit of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> nation, which has, in its voyages to the mo&s;t remote and mo&s;t oppo&s;ite parts of the globe, payed attention to every branch of &s;cience. The advantages are pointed out by the able pen of the Reverend Doctor DOUGLAS, in his Introduction to the la&s;t Voyage of
<PB REF="8">
our great navigator, publi&s;hed (under the au&s;pices of the Lords of the Admiralty) in a manner which reflects honor on our country in general, and will prove a mo&s;t la&s;ting monument to the memory of the great Officer who &s;o unfortunately pe|ri&s;hed by &s;avage hands, and his two able con&s;orts, who at length &s;unk beneath the pre&s;&s;ure of fatigue, in carrying the glory of di&s;covery far beyond the attempts of every preceding adventurer.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION. OF THE ARCTIC WORLD.</HEAD>
<P>AKNOWLEGE of the geography, climate, and &s;oil, and a general view of the productions of the countries, who&s;e Zoologic Hi&s;tory is to be treated of, are points &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that no apology need be made for introducing them into a prefatory di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>It is worthy human curio&s;ity to trace the gradual increa&s;e of the animal world, from the &s;canty pittance given to the rocks of <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> to the &s;warms of beings which enliven the vegetating plains of <HI>Senegal:</HI> to point out the cau&s;es of the local niggardne&s;s of certain places, and the prodigious plenty in others. The Botani&s;t &s;hould attend the fancied voyage I am about to take, to explain the &s;canty herbage of the <HI>Arctic</HI> regions; or, &s;hould I at any time hereafter de&s;cend into the lower latitudes, to inve&s;tigate the luxuriancy of plants in the warmer climates.</P>
<P>The Fo&s;&s;ili&s;t &s;hould join company, and point the variations of primaeval crea|tion, from the &s;olid rock of <HI>Spitzbergen</HI> through all the degrees of terre&s;trial matter: the &s;teps it makes to perfection, from the vile&s;t earth to the precious diamond of <HI>Golconda.</HI> The changes in the face of the globe &s;hould be attended to; the de|&s;tructions by vulcanoes; the ravages of the &s;ea on &s;ome coa&s;ts, and the recom|pence it may have made to others, by the retreat of its waters.</P>
<P>The pur&s;uit of the&s;e enquiries will al&s;o have a farther and more important object. Hi&s;tory &s;hould be called in, and a brief account given of the population of the more remote countries&mdash;the motives which induced mankind to &s;eek re|treats in climates &s;eemingly de&s;titute of incitements to migration. Particular attention &s;hould be paid to the means of peopling the new world, and of &s;tocking it with animals, to contribute to the &s;upport of mankind, after the fir&s;t coloniza|tion&mdash;the increa&s;e of tho&s;e animals, and their ce&s;&s;ation, and giving place in a certain latitude to genera entirely different.</P>
<P><PB N="II" REF="12">Here the fine &s;tudy of Geography &s;hould &s;tep in to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The outline of the terre&s;trial globe &s;hould be traced; the &s;everal approximations between part and part &s;hould be attended to; the nature of the oceans ob&s;erved; the various i&s;lands pointed out, as the &s;teps, the baiting-places where mankind might have re&s;ted in its pa&s;&s;age from an overcharged continent.</P>
<P>The manners of the people ought not le&s;s to be attended to; and their changes, both mental and corporeal, by compari&s;on of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of remote people with nations with whom they had common ance&s;tors, and who may have been di&s;covered &s;till to retain their primaeval &s;eats. Some leading cu&s;toms may &s;till have been pre|&s;erved in both; or &s;ome monuments of antiquity, proofs of congenial habitudes, po&s;&s;ibly no longer extant in the &s;avage than in the cultivated branches of the common &s;tock.</P>
<P>Let me take my departure northward, from the narrow &s;treights of <HI>Dover,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">STREIGHTS OF DOVES.</NOTE> the &s;ite of the i&s;thmus of the once penin&s;ulated <HI>Britain.</HI> No certain cau&s;e can be given for the mighty convul&s;ion which tore us from the continent: whether it was rent by an earthquake, or whether it was worn through by the continual da&s;hing of the waters, no <HI>Pythagoras</HI> is left to &s;olve the <HI>Fortuna locorum:</HI>
<Q><L>Vidi ego, quod &s;uerat quondam &s;olidi&s;&s;ima tellus</L>
<L>E&s;&s;e fretum</L></Q>
But it is mo&s;t probable, that the great philo&s;opher alluded to the partial de&s;truction of the <HI>Atlantica in&s;ula,</HI> mentioned by <HI>Plato</HI> as a di&s;tant tradition in his days<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plato</HI> died about the year 347 before CHRIST, aged 81. <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> about 497, aged 90.</NOTE>. It was effected by an earthquake and a deluge, which might have rent a&s;under the narrow i&s;thmus in que&s;tion, and left <HI>Britain,</HI> large as it &s;eems at pre&s;ent, the mere wreck of its original &s;ize<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See this opinion farther di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by Mr. <HI>Somner, Ph. Tran&s;. Abridg.</HI> iv. 230.</NOTE>. The <HI>Scilly</HI> i&s;les, the <HI>Hebrides, Orknies, Schet|lands,</HI> and perhaps the <HI>Feroe</HI> i&s;lands, may po&s;&s;ibly be no more than fragments of the once far-extended region. I have no quarrel about the word <HI>i&s;land.</HI> The little i&s;thmus, compared to the whole, might have been a junction never attend|ed to in the limited navigations of very early times. The penin&s;ula had never been wholly explored, and it pa&s;&s;ed with the antients for a genuine i&s;land. The corre&s;pondency of &s;trata on part of the oppo&s;ite &s;hores of <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> leaves no room to doubt but that they were once united.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHALKY STRATA.</NOTE> The chalky cliffs of <HI>Blanc-nez,</HI> between <HI>Calais</HI> and <HI>Bologne,</HI> and tho&s;e to the we&s;tward of <HI>Dover,</HI> ex|actly tally: the la&s;t are va&s;t and continued; the former &s;hort, and the termina|tion of the immen&s;e bed. Between <HI>Bologne</HI> and <HI>Folk&s;tone</HI> (about &s;ix miles from
<PB N="III" REF="13">
the latter) is another memorial of the junction of the two countries; a narrow &s;ubmarine hill, called the <HI>Rip-raps,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">RIP-RAPS.</NOTE> about a quarter of a mile broad, and ten miles long, extending ea&s;twards towards the <HI>Goodwin</HI> Sands. Its materials are boulder-&s;tones, adventitious to many &s;trata. The depth of water on it, in very low &s;pring-tides, is only fourteen feet. The fi&s;hermen from <HI>Folk&s;tone</HI> have often touched it with a fifteen feet oar; &s;o that it is ju&s;tly the dread of navigators. Many a tall &s;hip has peri&s;hed on it, and &s;unk in&s;tantly into twenty-one fathoms water. In <HI>July</HI> 1782, the <HI>Bellei&s;le</HI> of &s;ixty-four guns &s;truck, and lay on it during three hours; but, by &s;tarting her beer and water, got clear off.</P>
<P>The&s;e celebrated &s;treights are only twenty-one miles wide in the narrowe&s;t part.<NOTE PLACE="marg">WIDTH OF THE STREIGHTS.</NOTE> From the pier at <HI>Dover</HI> to that at <HI>Calais</HI> is twenty-four. It is conjectured, that their breadth le&s;&s;ens, and that they are two miles narrower than they were in antient times. An accurate ob&s;erver of fifty years, remarks to me, that the encrea&s;ed height of water, from a decrea&s;e of breadth, has been apparent even in that &s;pace. The depth of the channel, at a medium, in highe&s;t &s;pring-tides, is about twenty-five fathoms.

He may be rowed in this &s;olemn &s;cene till he finds him&s;elf &s;uddenly re&s;tored to the &s;ight of the heavens: he finds him&s;elf in a circular cha&s;m, open to the day, with a narrow bottom and exten&s;ive top, widening at the margin to the diameter of two hundred feet. On attaining the &s;ummit, he finds him&s;elf at a di&s;tance from the &s;ea, amid&s;t corn|fields or verdant pa&s;tures, with a fine view of the country, and a gentleman's &s;eat near to the place from which he had emerged. Such may be the amu&s;ement of the curious in &s;ummer calms! but when the &s;torms are directed from the ea&s;t, the view from the edge of this hollow is tremendous; for, from the height of above three hundred feet, they may look down on the furious waves, whitened with foam, and &s;welling from their confined pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>Penin&s;ulated rocks often jut from the face of the cliff's, precipitous on their &s;ides, and wa&s;hed by a great depth of water. The i&s;thmus which joins them to the land, is often &s;o extremely narrow as to render it impa&s;&s;able for more than two or three per&s;ons a-brea&s;t; but the tops &s;pread into verdant areas, containing ve&s;tiges of rude fortifications, in antient and barbarous times the retreat of the neighboring inhabitants from the rage of a potent invader<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e de&s;criptions borrowed from my own <HI>Tours.</HI></NOTE>.</P>

The plates, with explanatory accounts, &s;hall &s;upply what farther can elucidate the&s;e curious antiquities.</P>
<P>After the expul&s;ion of the <HI>Norwegians,</HI> the coa&s;ts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, were &s;till protected by ca&s;tles; many of which, &s;uch as <HI>Oldwick,</HI> ex|hibit very &s;mall improvements on the model left by the antient <HI>Scandinavian</HI> architects: a few deviated from the original manner, were &s;quare, had great thick|ne&s;s of wall, furni&s;hed with cells like tho&s;e in the round towers or <HI>burghs. Borve</HI> ca&s;tle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BORVE CASTLE.</NOTE> in <HI>Cathne&s;s,</HI> is a little more advanced. This was the re&s;idence of <HI>Thorkel,</HI> a famous freebooter in the tenth century. It is a &s;mall &s;quare building, on a rock projecting into the &s;ea, adjoined to the main land by an i&s;thmus not ten feet wide; and beneath the ca&s;tle is a magnificent pa&s;&s;age for boats, which pierces the rock from &s;ide to &s;ide, and is covered by a matchle&s;s natural arch.</P>
<P>I cannot but revert to the former &s;ubject, to mention the <HI>Snaburgh</HI> in <HI>Tet|lor,</HI> one of the mo&s;t remote of the <HI>Schetland</HI> i&s;les. It is in the form of a <HI>Roman</HI> camp;<NOTE PLACE="marg">ROMAN CAMP:</NOTE> and when entire, had in the middle a rectangular area &s;urrounded by a wall, and that by an earthen rampart of the &s;ame figure, at &s;ome di&s;tance from it. Two &s;ides of the walled area have the additional defence of another rampart of earth; which commences on the in&s;ide of one of the narrower &s;ides, and, pre&s;erving the &s;ame di&s;tance from the le&s;&s;er area as the two other &s;ides of the outward fence do, terminates at the latter, near an artificial well. That this was <HI>Roman,</HI> I greatly &s;u&s;pect. The care for water was a peculiar object with that wi&s;e nation; but neglected by barbarians. This is inclo&s;ed within the rampart, and at a &s;mall di&s;tance on the out&s;ide, had the protection of a mount, which once probably had its ca&s;tellet, garri&s;oned for the further &s;ecurity<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vegetius de re Milit. <HI>lib. iv. c. 10.</HI></NOTE>. The regular <HI>portae</HI> are wanting; in other re&s;pects it re&s;embles a <HI>Roman</HI> camp. The &s;ea, over which it impends, has de&s;troyed one half: the entire part is given in the plate, and the re&s;t &s;upplied with dotted lines.</P>
<P>I know but of two periods in which the <HI>Romans</HI> vi&s;ited the&s;e i&s;lands: one at the time when the fleet of <HI>Agricola</HI> &s;ubdued them; the other, when the fleet of <HI>Honorius</HI> defeated the <HI>Saxons</HI> in the &s;eas of <HI>Orkney.</HI> A copper medal of <HI>Ve&s;|pa&s;ian,</HI> with <HI>Judaea devicta</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr.</HI> Low.</NOTE> on the rever&s;e, was found on the &s;outh &s;ide of <HI>Main-land,</HI> probably lo&s;t there by the fir&s;t invaders, who might venerate <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian,</HI> under whom many of them had &s;erved, and who might naturally carry with them &s;uch honorable memorials of his reign.

If there never was a num|ber of &s;tones to complete a circle, this antiquity was one of the kind which the learned Doctor <HI>Borla&s;e</HI> calls a theatre, and &s;uppo&s;es was de&s;igned for the exhi|bition of dramatical performances<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Antiq.

I &s;u&s;pect them to have been either for the purpo&s;es of religion, or judicial tran&s;actions; for the age was probably not &s;uf|ficiently refined for the former amu&s;ements. Upright &s;tones, either memorials of the dead,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PLAIN COLUMNS.</NOTE> or victories obtained on the &s;pot, are very numerous. The mo&s;t re|markable is the &s;tone of <HI>Sator,</HI> in the i&s;le of <HI>Eda.</HI> It is a flag, fifteen feet high, five and a half broad, and only nine inches thick.

The a&s;hes, depo&s;ited in an urn which was covered on the top with a flat &s;tone, have been found in the cell of one of the barrows. This coffin or cell was placed on the ground, then covered with a heap of &s;tones, and that again ca&s;ed with earth and &s;ods.

<P>Circles, for the purpo&s;e of religious rites, were not wanting here.

There are &s;eventeen which are habitable, each of which is a lofty mountain ari&s;ing out of the waves, divided from the others by deep and rapid currents. Some of them are deeply indented with &s;ecure harbours; providence &s;eeming to have favored mankind with the &s;afe&s;t retreats in the mo&s;t boi&s;terous &s;eas. All are very &s;teep, and mo&s;t of

them faced with mo&s;t tremendous precipices. The &s;urface of the mountains con|&s;i&s;ts of a &s;hallow &s;oil of remarkable fertility; for barley, the only corn &s;own here, yields above twenty for one; and the gra&s;s affords abundant pa&s;turage for &s;heep. The exports are &s;alted mutton and tallow, goo&s;e quils, feathers, and Eider down; and, by the indu&s;try of the inhabitants, knit woollen wai&s;tcoats, caps, and &s;tock|ings. No trees beyond the &s;ize of juniper, or &s;tunted willows, will grow here: nor are any wild quadrupeds to be met with, except rats and mice, originally e&s;caped from the &s;hipping.</P>
<P>The li&s;t of land birds is very &s;mall:<NOTE PLACE="marg">LAND BIRDS.</NOTE>&mdash;The Cinereous Eagle, p. 214. B; the Lanner, p. 225. K; the Sparrow Hawk, p. 226.

The remaining land fowl are Wild Pigeons and Stares, White Wagtails, Wrens, and &s;ometimes the Swallow. The Snow Bunting only re&s;ts here in &s;pring, on its pa&s;&s;age northward. The Heron is &s;ometimes met with. The Spoon-Bill is Common<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Brunnich, <HI>p. 46.</HI></NOTE>. The Sea Pie, Water Rail, and Lapwing, are &s;een here. The birds of the rocks, &s;uch as Puffins, Razor Bills, and Little Auks, Fooli&s;h and Black Guillemots, &s;warm here; and the <HI>Geyir-fugl,</HI> or Great Auk, at certain periods vi&s;its the&s;e i&s;lands. The la&s;t, by rea&s;on of its &s;hort wing incapable of flight, ne&s;tles at the foot of the cliffs. The Skua, Arctic, Black-backed, and Herring Gulls, Fulmars, Manks, Stormy Petrels, Imber and Northern Divers, Wild Swans and Gee&s;e, (the Swans only vernal pa&s;&s;engers towards the north) Eider Ducks, Havelda or Long-tailed Ducks, Corvorants, and the Sula Gannet, form the &s;um of the palmated fowl of the&s;e inho&s;pitable &s;pots.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">FOWLING.</NOTE>The manner of fowling is &s;o very &s;trange and hazardous that the de&s;cription &s;hould by no means be omitted. Nece&s;&s;ity compels mankind to wonderful attempts. The cliffs which contain the objects of their &s;earch are often two hundred fathoms in height,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FROM ABOVE.</NOTE> and are attempted from above and below. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, the fowlers provide them&s;elves with a rope eighty or a hundred fathoms in length. The fowler fa&s;tens one end about his wai&s;t and between his legs, recommends him&s;elf to the protection of the Almighty, and is lowered down by &s;ix others, who place a piece of timber on the margin of the rock, to pre&s;erve the rope from wearing again&s;t the &s;harp edge. They have be&s;ides a &s;mall line fa&s;tened to the body of the ad|venturer, by which he gives &s;ignals that they may lower or rai&s;e him, or &s;hift him
<PB N="XLI" REF="56">
from place to place. The la&s;t operation is attended with great danger, by the loo&s;ening of the &s;tones, which often fall on his head, and would infallibly de&s;troy him, was it not protected by a &s;trong thick cap; but even that is found unequal to &s;ave him again&s;t the weight of the larger fragments of rock. The dexterity of the fowlers is amazing; they will place their feet again&s;t the front of the preci|pice, and dart them&s;elves &s;ome fathoms from it, with a cool eye &s;urvey the places where the birds ne&s;tle, and again &s;hoot into their haunts. In &s;ome places the birds lodge in deep rece&s;&s;es. The fowler will alight there, di&s;engage him&s;elf from the rope, fix it to a &s;tone, and at his lei&s;ure collect the booty, fa&s;ten it to his girdle, and re&s;ume his pendulous &s;eat. At times he will again &s;pring from the rock, and in that attitude, with a fowling net placed at the end of a &s;taff, catch the old birds which are flying to and from their retreats. When he hath fini&s;hed his dreadful employ, he gives a &s;ignal to his friends above, who pull him up, and &s;hare the hard-earned profit. The feathers are pre&s;erved for exportation: the fle&s;h is partly eaten fre&s;h: but the greater portion dried for winter's provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>The fowling from below has its &s;hare of danger.<NOTE PLACE="marg">FROM BELOW.</NOTE> The party goes on the expe|dition in a boat; and when it has attained the ba&s;e of the precipice, one of the mo&s;t daring, having fa&s;tened a rope about his wai&s;t, and furni&s;hed him&s;elf with a long pole with an iron hook at one end, either climbs, or is thru&s;t up by his companions, who place a pole under his breech, to the next footing &s;pot he can reach<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In <HI>Pontoppidan's Hi&s;t. Norway,</HI> ii. 61. is a plate expre&s;&s;ive of this manner of fowling.</NOTE>. He, by means of the rope, brings up one of the boats crew; the re&s;t are drawn up in the &s;ame manner, and each is furni&s;hed with his rope and fowling-&s;taff. They then continue their progre&s;s upwards in the &s;ame manner, till they arrive at the region of birds; and wander about the face of the cliff in &s;earch of them. They then act in pairs; one fa&s;tens him&s;elf to the end of his a&s;&s;ociate's rope, and, in places where birds have ne&s;tled beneath his footing, he permits him&s;elf to be lowered down, depending for his &s;ecurity to the &s;trength of his companion, who is to haul him up again; but it &s;ometimes happens that the per&s;on above is overpowered by the weight, and both inevitably peri&s;h. They fling the fowl down to the boat, which attends their motions, and receives the booty. They often pa&s;s &s;even or eight days in this tremendous employ, and lodge in the crannies which they find in the face of the precipice.</P>
<P>The &s;ea which &s;urrounds the&s;e i&s;lands is extremely turbulent. The tides vary greatly on the we&s;tern and ea&s;tern &s;ides. On the fir&s;t, where is received the un|interrupted flood of the ocean from the remote <HI>Greenland,</HI> the tide ri&s;es &s;even fa|thoms: on the ea&s;tern &s;ide it ri&s;es only three. Dreadful whirlwinds, called by the <HI>Danes, oes,</HI> agitate the &s;ea to a &s;trange degree; catch up a va&s;t quantity of water,
<PB N="XLII" REF="57">
&s;o as to leave a great temporary cha&s;m in the &s;pot on which it falls, and carries away with it, to an amazing di&s;tance, any fi&s;hes which may happen to be within reach of its fury. Thus great &s;hoals of Herrings have been found on the highe&s;t moun|tains of <HI>Feroe.</HI> It is equally re&s;i&s;tle&s;s on land, tearing up trees, &s;tones, and animals, and carrying them to very di&s;tant places. We mu&s;t no longer laugh at the good archbi&s;hop<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Olaus Magnus, <HI>Archb. of</HI> Up&s;al.</NOTE>, who gravely tells us, that at times, the Rats called <HI>Lemming</HI> are poured down from the clouds in great &s;howers on the <HI>Alps</HI> of <HI>Norway.</HI> We a&s;&s;ent to the fact; but mu&s;t &s;olve the phoenomenon by a&s;cribing it to a whirlwind, as he does in one place; yet immediately &s;uppo&s;es they may be bred in the upper regions <HI>out of feculent</HI> matter.</P>
<P>Among the numerous whirlpools of the&s;e &s;eas, that of <HI>Suderoe,</HI> near the i&s;land of the &s;ame name, is the mo&s;t noted. It is occa&s;ioned by a crater, &s;ixty-one fathoms in depth in the centre, and from fifty to fifty-five on the &s;ides. The water forms four fierce circumgirations. The point they begin at is on the &s;ide of a large ba&s;on, where commences a range of rocks running &s;pirally, and terminating at the verge of the crater. This range is extremely rugged, and covered with water from the depth of twelve to eight fathoms only. It forms four equidi&s;tant wreaths, with a channel from thirty-five to twenty fathoms in depth between each. On the out&s;ide, beyond that depth, the &s;ea &s;uddenly &s;inks to eighty and ninety. On the &s;outh border of the ba&s;on is a lofty rock, called <HI>Sumboe Munk,</HI> noted for the multitude of birds which frequent it. On one &s;ide, the water is only three or four fathoms deep; on the other fifteen. The danger at mo&s;t times, e&s;pecially in &s;torms, is very great. Ships are irre&s;i&s;tibly drawn in: the rudder lo&s;es its power, and the waves beat as high as the ma&s;ts; &s;o that an e&s;cape is almo&s;t miraculous: yet at the reflux, and in very &s;till weather, the inhabitants will venture in boats, for the &s;ake of fi&s;hing. Mr. <HI>Debes</HI> omits the times of greate&s;t danger. It is to be hoped that attention will be paid to the various periodical appearances of a phoenomenon, the cau&s;e of which is very &s;atisfactorily explained by the worthy pa&s;tor<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See his plan, p. 52.</NOTE>.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">BEARS.</NOTE>The Polar Bear, N^o 18, is often tran&s;ported from <HI>Greenland,</HI> on the i&s;lands of ice; but no &s;ooner is its landing di&s;covered, than a general alarm is &s;pread, and pur&s;uit made till it is de&s;troyed.

<P>The amphibious quadrupeds, or Seals, are very numerous. <HI>Iceland,</HI> being ble&s;&s;ed with dome&s;tic animals, has le&s;s u&s;e of this race than other <HI>Arctic</HI> coun|tries; yet they are of con&s;iderable advantage. The &s;kins are u&s;ed for cloathing; a good one is equal in value to the &s;kin of a &s;heep, or the hide of a cow; and the fat &s;upplies the lamps in the long nights with oil. The Common, during winter, is exce&s;&s;ively fat, and will yield &s;ixty pounds.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SEALS.</NOTE> The <HI>Icelanders</HI> have two &s;pecies of native Seals: the Common, N^o 72, called by them <HI>Land Saelur,</HI> becau&s;e it keeps near the coa&s;t; the other, the Great, N^o 73, or <HI>Ut-Saelur.</HI> They are taken in nets placed in the creeks and narrow bays, which they pa&s;s through to get on &s;hore. When it begins to grow dark the hunters make a fire, and fling into it the &s;havings of horns, or any thing that &s;mells &s;trong; this allures the Seals, who &s;trike into the nets, and are taken.
<PB N="LI" REF="66">
At other times, a <HI>koder</HI> or lure is tied to a rope, and placed before the nets; to which the Seals, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be &s;ome &s;trange animal, will eagerly &s;wim, and &s;trike into the nets, paying with their lives for their curio&s;ity. This carries them &s;ometimes &s;o far, that they will &s;tray to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance inland, attracted by a candle, or the fire in a &s;mith's forge. If they are taken young, they are capable of being tamed: they will follow their ma&s;ter, and come to him like a dog, when called by the name which is given them. The <HI>Icelanders</HI> have a &s;trange &s;uper&s;tition about the&s;e animals: they believe they re&s;emble the human &s;pecies more than any other, and that they are the offspring of <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and his ho&s;t, who were converted into Seals when they were overwhelmed in the <HI>Red Sea.</HI></P>
<P>Other &s;pecies of Seals are migratory. Among them is the Harp, N^o 77, or <HI>Vade-Selur.</HI> The&s;e quit the &s;eas of <HI>Iceland</HI> in <HI>March,</HI> and &s;wim through the &s;treights of <HI>Davies,</HI> by &s;ome unknown opening, to the farthe&s;t north; bring forth their young, and return, by the north of <HI>Greenland,</HI> in <HI>May,</HI> extremely lean, to the north of <HI>Iceland;</HI> continue their route, and return to that i&s;land about <HI>Chri&s;t|mas,</HI> chiefly upon the drift-ice, on which they are either &s;hot, or harpooned. The Hooded Seal, N^o 76, or <HI>Bladru</HI> Seal, is rarely taken here. The Walrus, N^o 71, or <HI>Ro&s;t-unger,</HI> is &s;ometimes wafted here from <HI>Greenland</HI> on the ice.</P>
<P>It cannot be expected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BIRDS.</NOTE> that many of the feathered tribe &s;hould inhabit an i&s;land &s;o very &s;evere in its climate, and &s;o remote from the more &s;outhern continent and i&s;lands.

is &s;aid to begin where &s;oundings end, yet its influence extends &s;everal leagues within the &s;oundings; and ve&s;&s;els often find a con&s;iderable current &s;etting to the northward all along the coa&s;t, till they get into eight or ten fathom water, even where the &s;oundings &s;tretch to twenty leagues from the &s;hore; but their current is generally augmented or le&s;&s;ened by the prevaling winds, the force of which, however, can but little affect the grand unfathomable &s;tream. From Cape <HI>Cannaveral</HI> to Cape <HI>Hatteras</HI> the &s;oundings begin to widen in the extent of their run from the &s;hore to the inner edge of the &s;tream, the di&s;tance being generally near twenty leagues, and the &s;oundings very regular to about &s;eventy fathoms near the edge of the &s;tream, where no bottom can be afterwards found. Abrea&s;t of <HI>Savannah</HI> river, the current &s;ets nearly north; after which, as if from a bay, it &s;tretches north-ea&s;t to Cape <HI>Hatteras;</HI> and from thence it &s;ets ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t, till it has lo&s;t its force. As Cape <HI>Hatteras</HI> runs a great way into the &s;ea, the edge of the &s;tream is only from five to &s;even leagues di&s;tant from the cape; and the force and rapidity of the main &s;tream has &s;uch influence, within that di&s;tance, over &s;hips bound to the &s;outhward, that in very high foul winds, or in calms, they have frequently been hurried back to the northward, which has often occa&s;ioned great di&s;appointment both to merchant &s;hips and to men of war, as was often experienced in the late war. In <HI>December</HI> 1754, an exceeding good &s;ailing &s;hip, bound from <HI>Philadelphia</HI> to <HI>Charle&s;town,</HI> got abrea&s;t of Cape <HI>Hatteras</HI> every day during thirteen days, &s;ometimes even with the tide, and in a middle di&s;tance be|tween the cape and the inner edge of the &s;tream; yet the &s;hip was forced back regularly, and could only recover its lo&s;t way with the morning breeze, till the fourteenth day, when a bri&s;k gale helped it to &s;tem the current, and get to the &s;outhward of the Cape. This &s;hews the impo&s;&s;ibility of any thing which has fallen into the &s;tream returning, or &s;topping in its cour&s;e.</P>
<P>On the out&s;ide of the &s;tream is a &s;trong eddy or contrary current towards the ocean; and on the in&s;ide, next to <HI>America,</HI> a &s;trong tide &s;ets again&s;t it. When it &s;ets off from Cape <HI>Hatteras,</HI> it takes a current nearly north-ea&s;t; but in its cour&s;e meets a great current that &s;ets from the north, and probably comes from <HI>Hud&s;on's Bay,</HI> along the coa&s;t of <HI>Labrador,</HI> till the i&s;land of <HI>Newfoundland</HI> divides it; part &s;etting along the coa&s;t through the &s;treights of <HI>Bellei&s;le,</HI> and &s;weep|ing pa&s;t Cape <HI>Breton,</HI> runs obliquely again&s;t the gulph-&s;tream, and gives it a more ea&s;tern direction: the other part of the northern current is thought to join it on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of <HI>Newfoundland.</HI> The influence of the&s;e joint cur|rents mu&s;t be far felt; yet po&s;&s;ibly its force is not &s;o great, nor contracted in &s;uch a pointed and circum&s;cribed direction as before they encountered.

<P>It was the hard fortune of Lord <HI>Mulgrave,</HI> at this &s;ea&s;on, to meet with one of tho&s;e amazing &s;hoals of ice which cover, at times, the&s;e &s;eas, for multitudes of leagues. He made the fulle&s;t trial, from long. 2 to 21 ea&s;t, and from about lat. 80. 40, as low as about 78. 30, oppo&s;ed by a face of ice without the lea&s;t opening, and with all the appearance of a &s;olid wall. It is well known, that the coa&s;ts of <HI>Sibiria</HI> are, after a northern tempe&s;t, rendered inacce&s;&s;ible for a va&s;t extent, by the polar ice being &s;et in motion. It is as well known, that a &s;trong &s;outhern wind will again drive them to their former &s;eats, and make the &s;hores of the Frozen ocean as clear as the equatorial &s;eas. A farther di&s;covery on this &s;ide was denied to the noble navigator. His misfortune will for ever redound to his honor, as it proved his &s;pirit, his per&s;everance, and a &s;oul fertile in expedients among the greate&s;t dif|ficulties!</P>
<P>That navigators have gone into higher latitudes I cannot deny: the authenticated in&s;tances only &s;hew their accidental good fortune, in having the ice driven towards the pole, and in making a retreat before they were enveloped in the returning ice. The <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians,</HI> under vice-admiral <HI>T&s;hit&s;haghef,</HI> within the&s;e very few years, made an attempt to &s;ail to the pole by the ea&s;tern &s;ide of <HI>Spitzbergen;</HI> but after &s;uffering great hard&s;hips, returned without effecting any di&s;covery.

but e&s;caped to enjoy the honor of his di&s;covery. Many other attempts were made, but the mo&s;t which the adventurers have done was to get from the mouth of one great river to another in the cour&s;e of a &s;ummer. I find very few names, ex|cept of rivers, in a tract &s;o va&s;t as it is, on account of its being &s;o little frequented. To the ea&s;t of the promontory <HI>Taimura,</HI> that of <HI>St. Transfigurationis</HI> bounds the ea&s;t &s;ide of the bay of <HI>Chatanga,</HI> in lat. 74. 40, long. from <HI>Ferro</HI> 125. <HI>Swaitoi-no&s;s,</HI> or the <HI>Holy Cape,</HI> in lat. 73. 15, is a far-projecting headland, and, with the i&s;les of the <HI>Lena,</HI> and another intervening headland, forms two va&s;t bays. Out of the mo&s;t ea&s;tern, into which the river <HI>Yana</HI> di&s;charges it&s;elf, one <HI>Schalourof,</HI> a broken <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> merchant, took his departure for an ea&s;tern di&s;covery. He began his voyage in <HI>July</HI> 1760 from the <HI>Lena,</HI> but was &s;o ob&s;tructed with ice that he was forced into the <HI>Yana,</HI> where he was detained the whole winter, by the &s;ame cau&s;e, till <HI>July</HI> 29th, 1761. He doubled the <HI>Swaitoi-no&s;s September</HI> the 6th; according to &s;ome, &s;aw to the north a montanous land, po&s;&s;ibly an i&s;land. He was eight days in getting through the pa&s;&s;age between the continent and the i&s;le of <HI>St. Diomede,</HI> which lies a little to the &s;outh-ea&s;t of the <HI>No&s;s.</HI> He pa&s;&s;ed with a favorable wind the mouths of the <HI>Indigirka</HI> and <HI>Alazeia,</HI> and getting entangled among the ice between the <HI>Medviedkie O&s;trova,</HI> or <HI>Bear I&s;lands,</HI> was obliged to lay up his ve&s;&s;el in one of the mouths of the <HI>Kolyma</HI> during winter, where he &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on rein-deer, which frequented tho&s;e parts in great herds during the &s;evere &s;ea&s;on; and on various &s;pecies of &s;almon and trout, which were pu&s;hing their way up the river before it was frozen. After this he made two other attempts. In the year 1763 he pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Pe&s;zcanoi-no&s;s,</HI> and got into a deep bay, called <HI>T&s;chao&ucirc;n Skaja Go&ucirc;ba,</HI> with the i&s;le of <HI>Sabedei</HI> at its mouth; the great <HI>Schalat&s;koi-no&s;s</HI> to the ea&s;t; and at its bottom the little river <HI>T&s;chao&ucirc;n,</HI> which di&s;charges it&s;elf here out of the land of the <HI>T&s;chut&s;ki,</HI> &s;ome of whom he &s;aw on the &s;hore, but they fled on his appearance. He found no means of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in this bay, therefore was obliged to return to the <HI>Lena,</HI> and was greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted in his pa&s;&s;age by the &s;trength of the current, which uni|formly &s;et from the ea&s;t. In 1764 he made his la&s;t attempt, and was, as is conjectured, &s;lain by the <HI>T&s;chut&s;ki;</HI> but whether he doubled the famous cape of that name, is left uncertain.

A little beyond is a large bay, either bounded by low land at the bottom, or &s;o exten&s;ive as to have the end invi&s;ible. To the &s;outh of this are two other bays; and in lat. 64. 13, long. 186. 36, is the extreme &s;outhern point of the land of the <HI>T&s;chut&s;ki.</HI> This formerly was called the <HI>Anadir&s;koi No&s;s.</HI> Near it BERING had conver&s;ation with eight men, who came off to him in a <HI>baidar,</HI> or boat covered with the &s;kins of &s;eals; from which BERING and others have named it the <HI>T&s;chut&s;ki No&s;s.</HI> A few leagues to the &s;outh-ea&s;t of this point lies <HI>Clerke</HI>'s i&s;land, in lat 63. 15, di&s;covered by Capt.

<P>The land from BERING'S <HI>T&s;chut&s;ki No&s;s</HI> trends va&s;tly to the we&s;t, and bounds on that &s;ide the va&s;t gulph of <HI>Anadir,</HI> into the bottom of which the river of the &s;ame name empties it&s;elf; and limits the territory of the <HI>T&s;chut&s;ki.</HI></P>
<P>From thence is a large extent of coa&s;t trending &s;outh-we&s;t from Cape St. <HI>Thad|deus,</HI> in lat. 62. 50, long. 180, the &s;outhern boundary of the gulph of <HI>Anadir,</HI> to <HI>Oljutor&s;koi No&s;s,</HI> beyond which the land retires full we&s;t, and forms in its bo&s;om a gulph of the &s;ame name. Off <HI>Thaddeus No&s;s</HI> appeared, on <HI>June</HI> 29th, abundance of walru&s;es and great &s;eals; and even the wandering <HI>albatro&s;s</HI> was &s;een in this high latitude<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Voyage</HI> iii. 241.</NOTE>. Between this and the <HI>Pengin&s;k</HI> gulph, at the end of the &s;ea of <HI>Ochot&s;k,</HI> is the <HI>i&s;thmus</HI> which unites the famous penin&s;ula of <HI>Kamt&s;chatka</HI> to the main land, and is here about a hundred and twenty miles broad, and extends in length from 52 to 61, north lat. The coa&s;ts are often low: often faced with cliffs, in many parts of an extraordinary height; and out at &s;ea are rude and &s;piring rocks, the haunts of leonine &s;eals, who&s;e dreadful roarings are frequently the pre&s;ervation of mariners, warning them of the danger, in the thick fogs of this climate<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">De&s;cr. Kamt&s;ch. <HI>429.</HI></NOTE>. The coa&s;t has but few harbours, notwith&s;tanding it juts frequently into great headlands. The mo&s;t remarkable are, the <HI>North Head,</HI> with its needle rocks, at the entrance of the bay of <HI>Awatcha (Voyage,</HI> vol. iii. tab. 58); <HI>Cheepoon&s;koi No&s;s,</HI> &s;till further north, engraven in vol. ii. tab. 84; and <HI>Kronot&s;koi No&s;s,</HI> with its lofty cliffs. The penin&s;ula widens greatly in the middle, and le&s;&s;ens almo&s;t to a point at Cape <HI>Lopatka,</HI> which &s;lopes into a low flat, and forms the &s;outhern ex|tremity of the country. The whole is divided lengthways by a chain of lofty rocky mountains, frequently covered with &s;now, and &s;hooting into conic &s;ummits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">VULCANOS.</NOTE> often &s;moking with vulcanic eruptions. They have broken out in numbers of places: the extinct are marked by the craters, or their broken tops.

Earthquakes, thunder, and lightning, join to fill the horror of the &s;cenery at land; while at &s;ea the waves ri&s;e to an uncommon height, and often divide &s;o as to &s;hew the very bottom of the great deep<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De&s;cr.

They dare not &s;tir out for fear of being fro&s;t-bitten. Snow lies on the ground from &s;ix to eight feet thick as late as <HI>May;</HI> and the &s;torms rage with uncommon impetuo&s;ity, owing to the &s;ubterraneous fires, the &s;ulphureous exhalations, and general vulcanic di&s;po|&s;ition of the country. The prevaling winds are from the we&s;t, which pa&s;&s;ing over the frozen wilds of <HI>Sibiria</HI> and <HI>Tartary,</HI> add keenne&s;s and rigour to the winters of <HI>Kamt&s;chatka.</HI> Winter continues till the middle of <HI>June:</HI> from that month to the middle of <HI>September</HI> may be called &s;ummer, if a &s;ea&s;on filled with rain, and mi&s;ts, and ungenial &s;kies, merits that name. Rye, barley, and oats, are committed to the earth, but &s;eldom come to perfection. The &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> depends therefore on importation from <HI>Sibiria.</HI> In &s;ome parts gra&s;s grows to a great height, and hay of uncommon nutriment is harve&s;ted for the fattening of cattle<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Voy.</HI> iii. 327.</NOTE>. Grain is a luxury for the coloni&s;ts only: the natives have other re&s;ources, the effects of nece&s;&s;ity. Excepting in few places, this is a land of in|corrigible barrenne&s;s. As &s;oon as the &s;ea otters and other pretious furs are ex|hau&s;ted, <HI>Kamt&s;chatka</HI> will be de&s;erted by the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians,</HI> unle&s;s they &s;hould think fit to colonize the continent of <HI>America,</HI> which the furs of that country, or the pro&s;pect of mineral wealth, may induce them to attempt.</P>
<P>Few ores have as yet been di&s;covered in this penin&s;ula:<NOTE PLACE="marg">ORES.</NOTE> not that it wants either copper or iron; but every nece&s;&s;ary in tho&s;e metals is imported at &s;o cheap a rate, that it is not worth while for a people ignorant in mining and &s;melting to &s;earch for them in the almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible mountains.</P>
<P>From the climate and the barren nature of <HI>Kamt&s;chatka,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PLANTS.</NOTE> the reader need not be

&s;urprized at the poverty of its <HI>Flora.</HI> It mu&s;t not be &s;uppo&s;ed that the &s;canty enu|meration of its plants ari&s;es from a neglect of &s;earch, or the want of a botani&s;t to explore its vegetable kingdom. STELLER, a fir&s;t-rate naturali&s;t of <HI>Germany,</HI> who attended BERING in his la&s;t voyage, re&s;ided here a con&s;iderable time after his e&s;cape from that unfortunate expedition, expre&s;sly to complete his remarks in natural hi&s;tory. The re&s;ult of his botanical re&s;earches was communicated to Doctor <HI>Gmelin,</HI> another gentleman &s;ent by the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> government to examine into the natural hi&s;tory of its dominions. <HI>Europe</HI> has from time to time been ran&s;acked for men of abilities to perform this meritorious mi&s;&s;ion, and the fruits of their labors have been liberally communicated to a public thir&s;ting for knowlege. The names of MULLER, GMELIN, STELLER, DE L'ISLE, KRASHANINICOFF, GUILDENSTAEDT, LEPECHIN, and PALLAS, will ever be held in re&s;pect, for adding to the &s;tock of natural knowlege. But how much is it to be lamented that <HI>England</HI> wants a patron to encourage the tran&s;lation of their works, locked up at pre&s;ent in <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> or <HI>German,</HI> concealed from the generality of readers, to the great &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion of knowlege!</P>
<P>I here give a li&s;t of the plants of <HI>Kamt&s;chatka</HI> in &s;y&s;tematic order; and from it annex an account of the u&s;es made of them by the natives of the penin&s;ula.

<P>From Cape <HI>Darby</HI> the land trends to the we&s;t, and ends in <HI>Point Rodney;</HI> low land, with high land far beyond, taking a northerly direction inland.

Whe|ther it was to be drawn with dogs or rein-deer, does not appear; for the i&s;land was de&s;erted, and only the remains of a few <HI>jourts</HI> to be &s;een. In lat. 64. 55, long. 192, is KING'S i&s;land, named in honor of the able and worthy continuator of the voyage. The continent oppo&s;ite to it bends towards the ea&s;t, and forms a &s;hallow bay; then &s;uddenly runs far into the &s;ea, and makes the mo&s;t we&s;tern extremity yet known, and probably the mo&s;t we&s;tern of all.

The traver&s;ing it was a work of infinite difficulty and danger.<NOTE PLACE="marg">DEPTH.</NOTE> The &s;ea &s;hallow; and the change from the greate&s;t depth, which did not exceed thirty fathoms, to the le&s;t, which was only eight, was &s;udden: the bottom muddy, cau&s;ed by the quantity of earth brought down from the va&s;t ri|vers which pour into it from the <HI>A&s;iatic</HI> &s;ide. We &s;u&s;pect that it receives but few from the <HI>American,</HI> their general tendency being ea&s;t and we&s;t. The <HI>Icy Sea</HI> is &s;hallow, not only becau&s;e its tides and currents are very incon&s;iderable; but its outlet through the &s;treights of <HI>Bering</HI> very narrow, and even ob&s;tructed in the middle by the i&s;lands of <HI>St. Diomedes:</HI> both which circum&s;tances impede the carrying away of the mud. The current, &s;mall as it is, comes chiefly from the &s;outh-we&s;t, and is another impediment. The land of each continent is very low near the &s;hores, and high at a &s;mall di&s;tance from them: the former is one in&s;tance of a corre&s;pondent &s;hallowne&s;s of water. The &s;oundings off each continent, at the &s;ame di&s;tances from the &s;hore, were exactly the &s;ame.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">ICE.</NOTE>The ice of this &s;ea differs greatly from that of <HI>Spitzbergen.</HI> It probably is en|tirely generated from the &s;ea-water. The <HI>Icy Sea</HI> &s;eems to be in no part bounded by lofty land, in the valleys of which might have been formed the &s;tupendous <HI>icebergs,</HI> which, tumbling down, form tho&s;e lofty i&s;lands we had before occa&s;ion to mention. The ice here is moveable, except about the great headlands, which are be&s;et with a rugged mountanous ice. It is notorious, that a &s;trong gale from the north in twenty-four hours covers the whole coa&s;t, for numbers of miles in breadth; will fill the &s;treights of BERING, and even the <HI>Kamt&s;chatkan</HI> &s;eas; and in &s;maller pieces extend to its i&s;lands. In the <HI>Icy Sea</HI> it con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of field ice. Some fields, very large, and &s;urrounded with le&s;&s;er, from forty
<PB N="CLIX" REF="175">
to fifty yards in extent, to four or five; the thickne&s;s of the larger pieces was about thirty feet under water; and the greate&s;t height of others above, about &s;ixteen or eighteen. It was tran&s;parent, except on the &s;urface, which was a little porous, and often very rugged: the re&s;t compact as a wall. At times it mu&s;t pack; for the mountanous ice which the <HI>Co&s;&s;ack Morkoff</HI> a&s;cended (&s;ee p. c.) mu&s;t have been of that nature. The de&s;truction of the ice is not effected by the &s;un, in a climate where fogs reign in far greater proportion than the &s;olar beams; neither will the &s;treights of BERING permit the e&s;cape of quantity &s;ufficient to clear the &s;ea of its va&s;t load. It mu&s;t, in a little time, become wholly filled with it, was it not for the rage of the winds, which da&s;hes the pieces together, breaks and grinds them into minute parts, which &s;oon melt, and re&s;olve into their ori|ginal element.</P>
<P>The animals of this &s;ea are very few, and may be reduced to the <HI>Polar Bear,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ANIMALS.</NOTE> N^o 18; the <HI>Walrus,</HI> N^o 71; and Seals.

LII. is given the only accurate figure of the <HI>Walrus</HI> I have ever &s;een. I cannot but &s;u&s;pect it to be a variety of the &s;pecies found in the <HI>Spitzbergen</HI> &s;eas. The tu&s;ks are more &s;lender, and have a &s;light di&s;|tingui&s;hing flexure: the whole animal is al&s;o much le&s;s. The length of one (not indeed the large&s;t) was only nine feet four inches; its greate&s;t circumference &s;even feet ten; weight, exclu&s;ive of the entrails, about eleven hundred pounds. They lay on the ice by thou&s;ands; and in the foggy weather cautioned our navi|gators, by their roaring, from running foul of it. They are u&s;ually &s;een &s;leeping, but never without &s;ome centinels to give notice of approaching danger: the&s;e awa|kened the next to them, they their neighbors, till the whole herd was rou&s;ed. The&s;e animals are the objects of chace with the <HI>T&s;chut&s;ki,</HI> who eat the fle&s;h, and cover their boats and hovels with the &s;kins. Whales abound in this &s;ea. Fi&s;h,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FISH.</NOTE> the food of Seals, and partly of the polar Bears, mu&s;t be found here, notwith|&s;tanding they e&s;caped the notice of the navigators. Shells and &s;ea-plants, the food of the <HI>Walrus,</HI> cannot be wanting.</P>
<P>Many &s;pecies of birds (which will occur in their place) were &s;een traver&s;ing this &s;ea. Gee&s;e and Ducks were ob&s;erved migrating &s;outhward in <HI>Augu&s;t;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BIRDS.</NOTE> whether from their breeding-place in a circum-polar land, or whether from the probably far-extending land of <HI>America,</HI> is not to be determined. Drift-wood was very &s;eldom &s;een here. Two trees, about three feet in girth, with their roots, were once ob&s;erved, but without bark or branches; a proof that they had been brought from afar, and left naked by their conte&s;t with the ice and elements.</P>
<P>The &s;ea, from the &s;outh of BERING'S &s;treights to the cre&s;cent of i&s;les between
<PB N="CLX" REF="176">
<HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> is very &s;hallow. It deepens from the&s;e &s;treights (as the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;eas do from tho&s;e of <HI>Dover)</HI> till &s;oundings are lo&s;t in the Pacific Ocean; but that does not take place but to the &s;outh of the i&s;les. Between them and the &s;treights is an increa&s;e from twelve to fifty-four fathom, except only off St. <HI>Thaddeus No&s;s,</HI> where there is a channel of greater depth. From the vulcanic di&s;po&s;ition I am led to believe not only that there was a &s;eparation of the continents at the &s;treights of BERING, but that the whole &s;pace, from the i&s;les to that &s;mall opening, had once been occupied by land; and that the fury of the watery element, actuated by that of fire, had, in mo&s;t remote times, &s;ubverted and overwhelmed the tract, and left the i&s;lands monumental fragments.</P>
<P>Whether that great event took place before or after the population of <HI>America,</HI> is as impo&s;&s;ible, as it is of little moment, for us to know. We are indebted to our navigators for &s;ettling the long di&s;pute about the point from which it was effected. They, by their di&s;coveries, prove, that in one place the di&s;|tance between continent and continent is only thirty-nine miles, not (as a celebrated cavili&s;t <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The author of</HI> Recherches Philo&s;ophiques &s;ur les Americains, <HI>i. 136.</HI></NOTE> would have it) eight hundred leagues. This narrow &s;treight has al&s;o in the middle two i&s;lands, which would greatly facilitate the migration of the <HI>A&s;iatics</HI> into the New World, &s;uppo&s;ing that it took place in canoes, after the convul&s;ion which rent the two continents a&s;under. Be&s;ides, it may be added, that the&s;e &s;treights are, even in the &s;ummer, often filled with ice; in winter, often frozen: in either ca&s;e mankind might find an ea&s;y pa&s;&s;age; in the la&s;t, the way was extremely ready for quadrupeds to cro&s;s, and &s;tock the continent of <HI>America.</HI> I may fairly call in the machinery of vulcanoes to tear away the other means of tran&s;it farther to the &s;outh, and bring in to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance the former &s;uppo&s;ition of &s;olid land between <HI>Kamt&s;chatka</HI> and <HI>Oonala&s;cha,</HI> in&s;tead of the cre&s;cent of i&s;lands, and which, prior to the great cata&s;trophe, would have greatly enlarged the means of migration; but the ca&s;e is not of that difficulty to require the &s;olution. One means of pa&s;&s;age is indi&s;putably e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>But where, from the va&s;t expan&s;e of the north-ea&s;tern world, to fix on the fir&s;t tribes who contributed to people the new continent, now inhabited almo&s;t from end to end, is a matter that baffles human rea&s;on. The learned may make bold and ingenious conjectures, but plain good &s;en&s;e cannot always accede to them. As mankind encrea&s;ed in numbers, they naturally protruded one another forward. Wars might be another cau&s;e of migrations. I know no rea&s;on why the <HI>A&s;iatic</HI> north might not be an <HI>officina virorum,</HI> as well as the <HI>European.</HI> The overteeming country, to the ea&s;t of the <HI>Riphaean</HI> mountains, mu&s;t find it nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;charge its inhabitants: the fir&s;t great wave of people was forced forward by the next to

<P>I cannot think the accounts well &s;upported,<NOTE PLACE="marg">WELSH.</NOTE> that <HI>America</HI> received any part of its fir&s;t inhabitants from <HI>Europe,</HI> prior to the fifteenth century.

All that is advanced in proof is, a quo|tation from one of our poets, which proves no more than that he had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by &s;ea and land. It is pretended that he made two voyages: that &s;ailing we&s;t, he left <HI>Ireland</HI> &s;o far to the north, that he came to a land unknown, where

he &s;aw many &s;trange things: that he returned home, and, making a report of the fruitfulne&s;s of the new-di&s;covered country, prevaled on numbers of the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> of each &s;ex to accompany him on a &s;econd voyage, from which he never returned.

<P>The continent which &s;tocked <HI>America</HI> with the human race, poured in the brute creation through the &s;ame pa&s;&s;age. Very few quadrupeds continued in the penin&s;ula of <HI>Kamt&s;chatka.</HI> I can enumerate only twenty-five which are inhabitants of land; for I mu&s;t omit the marine animals, which had at all times power of changing their &s;ituation: all the re&s;t per&s;i&s;ted in their migration, and fixed their re&s;i|dence in the New World. Seventeen of the <HI>Kamt&s;chatkan</HI> quadrupeds are found in <HI>America:</HI> others are common only to <HI>Sibiria</HI> or <HI>Tartary,</HI> having, for unknown cau&s;es, entirely evacuated <HI>Kamt&s;chatka,</HI> and divided them&s;elves between <HI>America</HI> and the parts of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> above cited. Multitudes again have de&s;erted the Old World, even to an individual, and fixed their &s;eats at di&s;tances mo&s;t remote from the &s;pot from which they took their departure; from mount <HI>Ararat,</HI> the re&s;ting-place of the ark, in a central part of the Old World, and excellently adapted for the di&s;per&s;ion of the animal creation to all its parts. We need not be &s;tartled at the va&s;t journies many of the quadrupeds took to arrive at their pre&s;ent &s;eats: Might not numbers of &s;pecies have found a convenient abode in the va&s;t <HI>Alps</HI> of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> in&s;tead of wandering to the <HI>Cordilleras</HI> of <HI>Chili?</HI> or might not others have been contented with the boundle&s;s plains of <HI>Tartary,</HI> in&s;tead of tra|velling thou&s;ands of miles, to the exten&s;ive flats of <HI>Pampas?</HI>&mdash;To endeavour to elucidate common difficulties is certainly a trouble worthy of the philo&s;opher and of the divine; not to attempt it would be a criminal indolence, a neglect to
<Q>Vindicate the ways of God to man.</Q>
But there are multitudes of points beyond the human ability to explain, and yet are truths undeniable: the facts are indi&s;putable, notwith&s;tanding the cau&s;es are concealed. In &s;uch ca&s;es, faith mu&s;t be called in to our relief. It would certainly be the height of folly to deny to that Being who broke open the great fountains of the deep to effect the deluge&mdash;and afterwards, to compel the di&s;per&s;ion of mankind to people the globe, directed the confu&s;ion of languages&mdash;powers in|ferior in their nature to the&s;e. After the&s;e wondrous proofs of Omnipotency,
<PB N="CLXVI" REF="182">
it will be ab&s;urd to deny the po&s;&s;ibility of infu&s;ing in&s;tinct into the brute creation. DEUS <HI>e&s;t anima brutorum;</HI> GOD him&s;elf is the &s;oul of brutes: His plea&s;ure mu&s;t have determined their will, and directed &s;everal &s;pecies, and even whole genera, by impul&s;e irre&s;i&s;tible, to move by &s;low progre&s;&s;ion to their de&s;tined re|gions. But for that, the <HI>Llama</HI> and the <HI>Pacos</HI> might &s;till have inhabited the heights of <HI>Armenia</HI> and &s;ome more neighboring <HI>Alps,</HI> in&s;tead of laboring to gain the di&s;tant <HI>Peruvian Andes;</HI> the whole genus of <HI>Armadillos,</HI> &s;low of foot, would never have ab&s;olutely quitted the torrid zone of the Old World for that of the New; and the whole tribe of Monkies would have gambolled together in the fore&s;ts of <HI>India,</HI> in&s;tead of dividing their re&s;idence between the &s;hades of <HI>Indo&s;tan</HI> and the deep fore&s;ts of the <HI>Bra&s;ils.</HI> Lions and Tigers might have infe&s;ted the hot parts of the New World, as the fir&s;t do the de&s;erts of <HI>Africa,</HI> and the la&s;t the provinces of <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> or the Pantherine animals of <HI>South America</HI> might have re|mained additional &s;courges with the &s;avage bea&s;ts of tho&s;e antient continents. The Old World would have been over&s;tocked with animals; the New remained an unanimated wa&s;te! or both have contained an equal portion of every bea&s;t of the earth. Let it not be objected, that animals bred in a &s;outhern climate, af|ter the de&s;cent of their parents from the ark, would be unable to bear the fro&s;t and &s;now of the rigorous north, before they reached <HI>South America,</HI> the place of their final de&s;tination. It mu&s;t be con&s;idered, that the migration mu&s;t have been the work of ages; that in the cour&s;e of their progre&s;s each generation grew hardened to the climate it had reached; and that after their arrival in <HI>America,</HI> they would again be gradually accu&s;tomed to warmer and warmer climates, in their removal from north to &s;outh, as they had in the rever&s;e, or from &s;outh to north. Part of the Tigers &s;till inhabit the eternal &s;nows of <HI>Ararat,</HI> and mul|titudes of the very &s;ame &s;pecies live, but with exalted rage, beneath the Line, in the burning &s;oil of <HI>Borneo</HI> or <HI>Sumatra;</HI> but neither Lions or Tigers ever mi|grated into the New World. A few of the fir&s;t are found in <HI>India</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> but they are found in numbers only in <HI>Africa.</HI> The Tiger extends as far north as we&s;tern <HI>Tartary,</HI> in lat. 40. 50, but never has reached <HI>Africa.</HI> I &s;hall clo&s;e this account with ob&s;erving, that it could be from no other part of the globe except <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> from whence the New World could receive the animal creation.</P>
<P>The late voyage of the illu&s;trious COOK has reduced the probable conjectures of philo&s;ophers into certainty. He has proved that the limits of the Old and New World approach within thirteen leagues of each other. We know that the intervening &s;treights are frequently frozen up; and we have great rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that the two continents might have been once united, even as low as the <HI>Aleutian</HI> i&s;lands, or lat. 52. 30.

in a climate not more rigorous than that which &s;everal animals might very well endure, and yet afterwards proceed gradually to the extreme of heat.</P>
<P>In fact, every other &s;y&s;tem of the population of the New World is now over|thrown. The conjectures of the learned, re&s;pecting the vicinity of the Old and New, are now, by the di&s;coveries of our great navigator, lo&s;t in conviction. The &s;trained &s;y&s;tems of divines, laudably indeed exerted in elucidating SACRED WRIT, appear to have been ill-founded; but, in the place of imaginary hypothe|&s;es, the real place of migration is uncontrovertibly pointed out.

He for a long &s;pace took a north-we&s;tern cour&s;e, cro&s;&s;ed <HI>Meni&s;chtic</HI> lake, in lat. 61, a water thirty-five miles in breadth, full of fine i&s;lands, and joining with the river <HI>Nama&s;&s;y.</HI> He pa&s;&s;ed over <HI>Wiethen</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;&s;ed</HI> lakes, and from the la&s;t kept due we&s;t. In <HI>April</HI> he reached <HI>Thleweyaza Yeth,</HI> a &s;mall lake in long. 19, we&s;t from <HI>Churchil</HI> fort, lat. 61. 30, near which he made &s;ome &s;tay to build canoes, now requi&s;ite again&s;t the breaking up of the fro&s;t. From that lake he began a cour&s;e due north, and cro&s;&s;ed a chain of lakes, of which <HI>Titumeg</HI> is one. In lat. 64. he went over <HI>Pe&s;hew</HI> lake; after that, the great lake <HI>Cogeed,</HI> out of which i&s;&s;ues a river pointing north-ea&s;t, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to fall into <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffin</HI>'s bay. About the middle of <HI>June</HI> he cro&s;&s;ed the great river <HI>Conge-catha|wha-chaga,</HI> in lat. 68. 46; and from <HI>Churchil</HI> river we&s;t long. 24. 2. About tho&s;e parts are the <HI>Stoney Mountains,</HI> extending in longitude from 116 to 122 from <HI>London:</HI> craggy, and of a tremendous a&s;pect. On <HI>July</HI> 7th he arrived at <HI>Buffalo</HI> lake, in lat. 69. 30: here he fir&s;t &s;aw the <HI>Mu&s;k Buffalo,</HI> N^o 2. Near the north end is <HI>Grizzle Bear-hill,</HI> in about lat. 70, &s;o called from its being the haunt of numbers of tho&s;e animals. On <HI>July</HI> 13th he reached the banks of <HI>Copper River,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">COPPER RIVER.</NOTE> which runs due north into the <HI>Icy Sea.</HI> About the &s;outh end is much wood, and very high hills. Its current is very rapid, and its channel choaked with &s;hoals, and cro&s;&s;ed with &s;toney ridges, which form three great cataracts. Its banks are high, the breadth about a hundred and eighty yards; but in &s;ome places it expands into the form of a lake. In an i&s;land of the river unfortunately happened to be a &s;ummer encampment of five tents of <HI>E&s;kimaux.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ESKIMAUX.</NOTE> The <HI>Indians</HI> attendant on Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI> grew furious at the &s;ight of them. It is their firm opinion, that the&s;e &s;avages are magicians, and that all the evils they experience re&s;ult from their incantations. Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI> in vain &s;olicited his <HI>Indians</HI> to forbear injuring the&s;e poor people. They, with their u&s;ual cowardice, deferred the attack till night, when they &s;urpri&s;ed and murdered every one, to the number of between twenty and thirty. A young woman made her e&s;cape, and embraced Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI>'s feet; but &s;he was pur&s;ued by a barbarian, and transfixed to the ground. He ob&s;erved in their tents (which were made of deer-&s;kins with the hair on) copper ve&s;&s;els, and whale-bone, and the &s;kins of Seals, wooden troughs, and kettles made of a &s;oft &s;tone (by his de&s;cription a <HI>lapis ollaris),</HI> and di&s;hes and &s;poons formed from

In their dre&s;s they much re&s;emble the <HI>E&s;kimaux</HI> of <HI>Hud&s;on's Bay,</HI> but the tails of their jackets are &s;horter; neither do the women, like them, &s;tiffen out the tops of their boots. Their canoes differ in not having long projecting prows, but in other re&s;pects are of the &s;ame con&s;truction. In mo&s;t circum&s;tances the&s;e people re&s;emble tho&s;e of the <HI>Bay;</HI> and differ materially only in one, for the men in the&s;e pull out by the roots all the hair of their heads.&mdash;Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI> fir&s;t &s;aw the &s;ea on <HI>July</HI> 16, at the di&s;tance of eight miles. He went to the mouth of the river (in lat. 72; we&s;t long, from <HI>London</HI> 121) which he found full of &s;hoals and falls, and inacce&s;&s;ible to the tide, which &s;eemed to flow twelve or fourteen feet. The &s;ea was at this time full of ice, and on many pieces he &s;aw Seals. The land trended both to the ea&s;t and to the we&s;t, and the &s;ea was full of i&s;lands. The land about <HI>Copper</HI> river, for the &s;pace of nine or ten miles to the &s;ea, con|&s;i&s;ted of fine mar&s;hes, filled in many places with tall Willow, but no &s;ort of berry-bearing &s;hrubs. There are no woods within thirty miles of the mouth of <HI>Copper</HI> river; and tho&s;e which then appear, con&s;i&s;t of ill-&s;haped and &s;tunted Pines.</P>
<P>The people who live neare&s;t to this river, are the <HI>Copper-mine Indians,</HI> and the <HI>Plat-cotes de Chiens,</HI> or <HI>Dog-ribbed Indians;</HI> the&s;e have no direct commerce with <HI>Hud&s;on's Bay,</HI> but &s;ell their furs to the more &s;outhern <HI>Indians,</HI> who come for them, and bring them down to the &s;ettlements.

<P>Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI> &s;et out on his return the 22d of <HI>July.</HI> He took, in &s;ome places, a route different from what he did in going, and got to the &s;ettlements in <HI>June</HI> 1772. I have peru&s;ed the journal, and had frequent conver&s;ation with Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI> the la&s;t year. I took the liberty to que&s;tion him about the waters he had cro&s;&s;ed during winter upon the ice; and whether they might not have been at that time ob&s;tructed &s;treights, a pa&s;&s;age to the <HI>Pacific Ocean?</HI> He a&s;&s;ured me, that he could make no mi&s;take: that he pa&s;&s;ed over many of them in canoes during the &s;um|mer,

and that the others had large rivers running out of them, almo&s;t every one to the we&s;t: that the <HI>Indians,</HI> who cro&s;&s;ed them annually, in their way to the north to trade for furs, were exceedingly well acquainted with them, and knew them to be fre&s;h-water lakes; and in particular u&s;ed to fi&s;h in them for Pikes, fi&s;h notoriou&s;ly known never to frequent &s;alt-water.</P>

<P><HI>Greenland</HI> has been mo&s;t happy in its Zoologi&s;t. The Reverend Mr. <HI>Otto Fa|bricius,</HI> whom a laudable zeal for enlightening the minds of the gro&s;s inhabitants,
<PB N="CLXXXII" REF="198">
led to the&s;e parts, hath given a mo&s;t ample and cla&s;&s;ical account of the animals. His <HI>Fauna Groenlandica</HI> is among the fir&s;t works of the kind. I eagerly ex|pect the performance of the promi&s;ed remainder of the work.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">QUADRUPEDS.</NOTE>The Quadrupeds of this country are, the <HI>Rein-deer,</HI> N^o 4, which are here merely con&s;idered as objects of the chace. Their number is le&s;&s;ened greatly, and they are now only found in the mo&s;t remote parts. The <HI>Ukalcrajek</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Faun. Groenl. <HI>p. 26.</HI></NOTE> is, I &s;u&s;pect, an animal of imagination. It is &s;aid, by the <HI>Greenlanders,</HI> to be long|eared, hare-lipped, and to re&s;emble that animal; to have a &s;hort tail; to be of a white color, with a dark li&s;t down the back, and of the &s;ize of a Rein-deer. The DOGS, p. 41, re&s;emble Wolves in figure, &s;ize, and nature. Left to them|&s;elves, they hunt in packs the few animals of the country, for the &s;ake of prey. They exactly re&s;emble the Dogs of the <HI>E&s;kimaux</HI> of <HI>Labrador.</HI> It is probable, that they might have been originally brought here by their ma&s;ters, who fir&s;t fled that country, and populated <HI>Greenland.</HI> ARCTIC FOXES, N^o 10, abound here; and, with POLAR BEARS, N^o 18, infe&s;t the country. Had I not &s;uch excellent authority, I &s;hould have doubted whether the <HI>Wolverene,</HI> N^o 21, u&s;ually an inhabitant of wooded countries, was found in <HI>Greenland;</HI> but it is certainly met with, yet rarely, in the &s;outhern parts, where it preys on the Rein-deer and White Hares. It mu&s;t have been originally wafted hither on the ice from <HI>Terra de Labrador,</HI> the neare&s;t place to this, of which it is an inhabitant. The VARYING HARE, N^o 37, is very common. The WALRUS, and five &s;pecies of Seals, inhabit the&s;e &s;eas: the Common, N^o 72; the Great, N^o 73; the Rough, N^o 74; the Hooded, N^o 76; the Harp, N^o 77; and an ob&s;cure &s;pecies, called by the <HI>Laplanders, Fatne Vindac,</HI> with a round head and long &s;nout, bending like the probo&s;cis of an elephant<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Same, p. 17.&mdash;<HI>Leems Lapm.</HI> 214, 215.</NOTE>.

<P>The Polar Bears, Seals, and Manati, were originally natives of the&s;e coun|tries. The other Quadrupeds found their way here from either <HI>Hud&s;on's Bay</HI> or <HI>Labrador,</HI> on the i&s;lands of ice. The <HI>Arctic</HI> Fox found the &s;ame kind of conveyance from <HI>Greenland</HI> to <HI>Iceland</HI> as it did with the Rein-deer to <HI>Spitzbergen.</HI> To the la&s;t was wafted, probably from <HI>Labrador,</HI> the Common Wee&s;el, the Red or Com|mon Fox; and the Mou&s;e, mentioned p. XLIX, mi&s;&s;ed <HI>Greenland,</HI> but arrived at and &s;tocked <HI>Iceland;</HI> and the Common Bat was originally tempe&s;t-driven to the latter from <HI>Norway:</HI> the Wolverene and Varying Hare never reached farther than <HI>Greenland.</HI>&mdash;This &s;eems the progre&s;s of Quadrupeds in the frigid zone, as high as land is found.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">BAFFIN'S BAY.</NOTE>At lat. 72. 30, I mu&s;t take as my pilot that great &s;eaman <HI>William Baffin,</HI> who gave name to the great bay I now enter on. His fir&s;t voyage was in 1613; his &s;econd, in which he made the mo&s;t effectual trial for the north-we&s;t pa&s;&s;age, was in 1616. He pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>Davis's Streights.</HI> In lat. 70. 20, on the <HI>London Coa&s;t,</HI> he found the tides ri&s;e only eight or nine feet.

In the &s;ummer they live chiefly on fowls, or their eggs; but in general they forbear fle&s;h, as the fa&s;ts pre&s;cribed by their religion are &s;o nu|merous. They are dre&s;&s;ed in the &s;kins of the animals they kill, which they u&s;e with the fur &s;ide next to their bodies: their bedding is likewi&s;e compo&s;ed of &s;kins, chiefly of tho&s;e of the Bear or Rein Deer. The &s;kin of the Fox is the mo&s;t va|luable; but the&s;e are pre&s;erved as articles of commerce in their own country. They catch the Beluga, or white Whale, in nets, being conver&s;ant in this &s;pecies of fi&s;hery; but are ignorant of that of the great Whale. They were very &s;olicitous to get information on that &s;ubject; which I endeavoured to in&s;truct them in, in return for the information they &s;o readily gave me. They are mo&s;t excellent mark&s;men; but, what is peculiar, in pre&s;enting their piece, they do not rai&s;e it to their &s;houlder, but place the butt-end between their arm and their &s;ide, fixing their eye on the object toward which they direct the barrel.

At the di&s;tance of a hundred and twenty-eight miles from the mouth was &s;carcely any tide; thirty miles fur|ther it quite died away. The land here grew contracted into a very narrow pa&s;&s;age. Here the adventurers entered with the cutter, and di&s;covered that the end was in a magnificent fre&s;h-water lake, to which was given the name of <HI>Baker</HI>'s. The land was quite level, rich in gra&s;s, and abounding with Deer. They found the end quite innavigable, and to terminate in a &s;mall &s;tream, with many &s;hoals at its mouth, and three falls acro&s;s it.

<P><HI>Hud&s;on's Bay</HI> has been &s;o frequently de&s;cribed, that I &s;hall only give a general view of it and its adjacent parts. Its entrance from the ocean, after leaving to the north <HI>Cape Farewell</HI> and <HI>Davis's Streights,</HI> is between <HI>Re&s;olution</HI> i&s;les on the north, and <HI>Button's</HI> i&s;les, on the <HI>Labrador</HI> coa&s;t, to the &s;outh, forming the ea&s;tern extre|mity of the &s;treights di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of its great di&s;coverer. The coa&s;ts very high, rocky, and rugged at top; in places precipitous; but &s;ome|times exhibit large beaches. The i&s;les of <HI>Sali&s;bury, Nottingham,</HI> and <HI>Digges,</HI> are al&s;o very lofty, and naked. The depth of water in the middle of the bay is a hundred and forty fathoms. From <HI>Cape Churchill</HI> to the &s;outh end of the bay are regular &s;oundings; near the &s;hore &s;hallow, with muddy or &s;andy bottom. To the north of <HI>Churchill,</HI> the &s;oundings are irregular, the bottom rocky, and in &s;ome parts the rocks appear above the &s;urface at low water. From <HI>Moo&s;e</HI> river, or the bottom of the bay, to <HI>Cape Churchill,</HI> the land is flat, mar&s;hy, and wooded with Pines, Birch, Larch, and Willows. From <HI>Cape Churchill</HI> to <HI>Wager's Water</HI> the coa&s;ts are all high and rocky to the very &s;ea, and woodle&s;s, except the mouths of <HI>Pockereke&s;ko,</HI> and <HI>Seal</HI> rivers. The hills on their back are naked, nor are there any trees for a great di&s;tance inland.</P>
<P>The mouths of all the rivers are filled with &s;hoals, except that of <HI>Churchill,</HI> in which the large&s;t &s;hips may lie; but ten miles higher, the channel is ob&s;tructed with &s;and-banks; and all the rivers, as far as has been navigated, are full of rapids

and cataracts, from ten to &s;ixty feet perpendicular. Down the&s;e rivers the <HI>Indian</HI> traders find a quick pa&s;&s;age; but their return is a labor of many months.</P>
<P>As far inland as the Company have &s;ettlements, which is &s;ix hundred miles to the we&s;t, at a place called <HI>Hud&s;on Hou&s;e,</HI> lat. 53. long. 106. 27, from <HI>London,</HI> is flat country: nor is it known how far to the ea&s;tward the great chain, &s;een by our navigators from the <HI>Pacific Ocean,</HI> branches off.</P>
<P>The climate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CLIMATE.</NOTE> even about <HI>Haye</HI>'s river, in only lat. 57, is, during winter, ex|ce&s;&s;ively cold. The &s;nows begin to fall in <HI>October,</HI> and continue falling by in|tervals the whole winter; and, when the fro&s;t is mo&s;t rigorous, in form of the fine&s;t &s;and. The ice on the rivers is eight feet thick. Port wine freezes into a &s;olid ma&s;s; brandy coagulates. The very breath fell on the blankets of the beds in form of a hoar fro&s;t, and the bed-cloaths often were found frozen to the wall<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Voy. to Hud&s;on's Bay,</HI> 1746, written by the Clerk of the <HI>California,</HI> i. 159.

<P>The boa&s;ted mine of this i&s;land lies on the &s;outhern and we&s;tern &s;ides, on the great bank, which &s;tretches from north-ea&s;t to &s;outh-we&s;t, about two hundred leagues.

A great &s;well and thick fog generally mark the place of the greater. The &s;ubject of the fi&s;hery has been often treated of; but the following &s;hort though clear account of &s;o intere&s;ting a &s;ubject cannot fail being acceptable to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> reader.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">NEWFOUNDLAND FISHERY.</NOTE>"The boats or &s;hallops are forty feet in the keel, rigged with a mainma&s;t and forema&s;t, and lug&s;ails; furni&s;hed with four oars, three of which row on one &s;ide, and the other (which is twice as large) <HI>belays</HI> the other three, by being rowed &s;ideways over the &s;tern, by a man who &s;tands up for that purpo&s;e, with his face towards the rowers, counteracting them, and &s;teering at the &s;ame time as he gives way to the boat.</P>
<P>"Each of the men in this boat is furni&s;hed with two lines, one at each &s;ide of the boat, each furni&s;hed with two hooks; &s;o here are &s;ixteen hooks con&s;tantly em|ployed; which are thought to make a tolerable good day's work of it, if they bring in from five to ten quintals of fi&s;h, though they have &s;towage for, and &s;ometimes bring in thirty. Two hundred quintals is called a &s;aving voyage; but not under. The bait is &s;mall fi&s;h of all kinds; Herring, Capelin, Lance, Tom Cod, or young Cod; the fir&s;t of which they &s;alt, and keep for &s;ome time, in ca&s;e of &s;carcity of the re&s;t; but the&s;e are not near &s;o eagerly taken by the fi&s;h when &s;alted. In ca&s;e &s;mall fi&s;h cannot be got, they u&s;e &s;ea-fowl, which are ea&s;ily taken in va&s;t numbers, by laying nets over the holes in the rocks where they come to roo&s;t in the night. If neither &s;mall fi&s;h nor birds are to be got, they are forced to u&s;e the maws of fi&s;h they catch, which is the wor&s;t bait of any.</P>
<P>"When the fi&s;h are taken, they are carried to the &s;tage, which is built with one end over the water for the conveniency of throwing the offals into the &s;ea, and
<PB N="CXCVII" REF="213">
for their boats being able to come clo&s;e to di&s;charge their fi&s;h. As &s;oon as they come on the &s;tage a boy hands them to the header, who &s;tands at the &s;ide of a table next the water end; who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to gut the fi&s;h and cut off the head, which he does by pre&s;&s;ing the back of the head again&s;t the &s;ide of the table, which is made &s;harp for that purpo&s;e; when both head and guts fall through a hole in the floor into the water. He then &s;hoves the fi&s;h to the &s;plitter, who &s;tands oppo&s;ite to him; his bu&s;ine&s;s is to &s;plit the fi&s;h, beginning at the head, and open|ing it down to the tail; at the next cut he takes out the larger part of the back-bone, which falls through the floor into the water. He then &s;hoves the fi&s;h off the table, which drops into a kind of hand-barrow, which, as &s;oon as filled, is car|ried off to the &s;alt-pile. The header al&s;o flings the liver into a &s;eparate ba&s;ket, for the making of train-oil, u&s;ed by the curriers, which bears a higher price than Whale-oil.</P>
<P>"In the &s;alt pile, the fi&s;h are &s;pread upon one another, with a layer of &s;alt between. Thus they remain till they have taken &s;alt; and then are carried, and the &s;alt is wa&s;hed from them by throwing them off from &s;hore in a kind of float called a <HI>Pound.</HI> As &s;oon as this is completed, they are carried to the la&s;t operation, of drying them; which is done on &s;tanding flakes made by a &s;light wattle, ju&s;t &s;trong enough to &s;upport the men who lay on the fi&s;h, &s;upported by poles, in &s;ome places as high as twenty feet from the ground: here they are expo&s;ed, with the open &s;ide to the &s;un; and every night, when it is bad weather, piled up five or &s;ix on a heap, with a large one, his back or &s;kinny part uppermo&s;t, to be a &s;hel|ter to the re&s;t from rain, which hardly damages him through his &s;kin, as he re&s;ts &s;lanting each way to &s;hoot it off. When they are tolerably dry, which in good weather is in a week's time, they are put in round piles of eight or ten quin|tals each, covering them on the top with bark. In the&s;e piles they remain three or four days to &s;weat; after which they are again &s;pread, and when dry put into larger heaps, covered with canvas, and left till they are put on board.</P>
<P>"Thus prepared, they are &s;ent to the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> where they fetch a good price; but are not e&s;teemed in <HI>England:</HI> for which place another kind of fi&s;h is prepared, called by them Mud Fi&s;h; which, in&s;tead of being &s;plit quite open, like their dry fi&s;h, are only opened down to the navel. They are &s;alted, and lie in &s;alt, which is wa&s;hed out of them in the &s;ame manner with the others; but in&s;tead of being laid out to dry, are barrelled up in a pickle of &s;alt boiled in water.</P>
<P>"The train-oil is made from the livers: it is called &s;o to di&s;tingui&s;h it from Whale or Seal oil, which they call fat oil, and is &s;old at a lower price (being only
<PB N="CXCVIII" REF="214">
u&s;ed for lighting of lamps) than the train-oil, which is u&s;ed by the curriers. It is thus made:&mdash;They take a half tub, and, boring a hole through the bottom, pre&s;s hard down into it a layer of &s;pruce boughs; upon which they place the livers; and expo&s;e the whole apparatus to as &s;unny a place as po&s;&s;ible. As the livers cor|rupt the oil runs from them, and, &s;training it&s;elf clear through the &s;pruce boughs, is caught in a ve&s;&s;el &s;et under the hole in the tub's bottom."</P>

<P><PB N="6" REF="227"><NOTE PLACE="marg">HARD TO BE TAMED.</NOTE>Attempts have been made to tame and dome&s;ticate the wild, by catching the calves and bringing them up with the common kind, in hopes of improving the breed. It has not yet been found to an|&s;wer: notwith&s;tanding they had the appearance for a time of having lo&s;t their &s;avage nature, yet they always grew impatient of re&s;traint, and, by rea&s;on of their great &s;trength, would break down the &s;tronge&s;t inclo&s;ure, and entice the tame cattle into the corn-fields. They have been known to engender together, and to breed; but I cannot learn whether the &s;pecies was meliorated <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Kalm,</HI> i. 207.</NOTE> by the intercour&s;e: probably per&s;everance in continuing the cro&s;&s;es is only wanted to effect their thorough dome&s;tication; as it is notorious that the <HI>Bi&s;ons</HI> of the old world were the original &s;tock of all our tame cattle.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the only animals which had any affinity to the <HI>Euro|pean</HI> cattle on the fir&s;t di&s;covery of the new world: before that pe|riod, it was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of neither Hor&s;e nor A&s;s, Cow nor Sheep, Hog, Goat, nor yet that faithful animal the Dog. Mankind were here in a &s;tate of nature; their own pa&s;&s;ions un&s;ubdued, they never thought of conquering tho&s;e of the brute creation, and rendering them &s;ub&s;ervient to their will. The few animals which they had congenerous to tho&s;e mentioned, might po&s;&s;ibly by indu&s;try have been reclamed. This animal might have been brought to all the u&s;es of the <HI>European</HI> Cow; the <HI>Pecari</HI> might have been &s;ub&s;tituted for the Hog; the Fox or Wolf for the Dog: but the natives, living wholly by cha&s;e, were at war with the animal creation, and neglected the cultivation of any part, except the la&s;t, which was imperfectly tamed.</P>
<P>Such is the ca&s;e even to the pre&s;ent hour; for neither the example of the <HI>Europeans,</HI> nor the vi&s;ible advantages which re&s;ult from an at|tention to that u&s;eful animal the Cow, can induce the <HI>Indian</HI> to pay any re&s;pect to it.

<P>When a large party meditates a hunting-match, which is u&s;ually at the beginning of winter, they agree on a place of rendezvous, often five hundred miles di&s;tant from their homes, and a place, perhaps, that many of them had never been at. They have no other me|thod of fixing on the &s;pot than by pointing with their finger. The preference is given to the elde&s;t, as the mo&s;t experienced<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cate&s;by,</HI> App. xii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="254">When this matter is &s;ettled, they &s;eparate into &s;mall parties, travel and hunt for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence all the day, and re&s;t at night; but the wo|men have no certain re&s;ting-places.

<P>The cha&s;e is carried on in different ways. Some &s;urpri&s;e the Deer by u&s;ing the &s;tale of the head, horns, and hide, in the manner be|fore mentioned: but the general method is performed by the whole body. Several hundreds di&s;per&s;e in a line, encompa&s;&s;ing a va&s;t &s;pace of country, fire the woods, and drive the animals into &s;ome &s;trait or penin&s;ula, where they become an ea&s;y prey. The Deer alone are not the object; Foxes, Raccoons, Bears, and all bea&s;ts of fur, are thought worthy of attention, and articles of commerce with the <HI>Europeans.</HI></P>
<P>The number of Deer de&s;troyed in &s;ome parts of <HI>America</HI> is incre|dible; as is pretended, from an ab&s;urd idea which the Savages have, that the more they de&s;troy, the more they &s;hall find in &s;ucceeding years. Certain it is that multitudes are de&s;troyed; the tongues only pre&s;erved, and the carca&s;es left a prey to wild bea&s;ts. But the motive is much more political. The Savages well di&s;cern, that &s;hould they over&s;tock the market, they would certainly be over-reached by the <HI>European</HI> dealers, who take care never to produce more goods than are barely &s;ufficient for the demand of the &s;ea&s;on, e&s;tabli&s;hing their prices according to the quantity of furs brought by the natives. The hunters live in their quarters with the utmo&s;t fe&s;tivity, and indulgence

in all the luxuries of the country. The cha&s;e rouzes their appetites; they are perpetually eating, and will even ri&s;e to obey, at midnight, the calls of hunger. Their viands are exqui&s;ite. Veni&s;on boiled with red pea&s;e; turkies barbecued and eaten with bears fat; fawns cut out of the does belly, and boiled in the native bag; fi&s;h, and crayfi&s;h, taken in the next &s;tream; dried peaches, and other fruits, form the chief of their good living<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Law&s;on, <HI>207.</HI></NOTE>.

<P>Nece&s;&s;ity alone &s;ometimes compels them to attack and feed on the &s;wine they meet in the woods: but fle&s;h is to them an un|natural diet. They live on berries, fruits, and pul&s;e of all kinds; are remarkably fond of potatoes, which they very readily dig up with their great paws; make great havock in the fields of maize; and are great lovers of milk and honey. They feed much on herrings, which they catch in the &s;ea&s;on when tho&s;e fi&s;h come in &s;hoals up the creeks, which gives their fle&s;h a di&s;agreeable ta&s;te; and the &s;ame effect is ob&s;erved when they eat the bitter berries of the <HI>Tupelo.</HI></P>
<P>They are equally inoffen&s;ive to mankind, provided they are not irritated; but if wounded, they will turn on their a&s;&s;ailant with great fury, and, in ca&s;e they can lay hold, never fail of hugging him to death; for it has been ob&s;erved they never make u&s;e, in their rage, of either their teeth or claws.

<P>The naturali&s;t's poet, with great truth and beauty, de&s;cribes the retreat of this animal in the frozen climate of the north:
<Q><L>There through the piny fore&s;t half ab&s;orpt,</L>
<L>Rough tenant of tho&s;e &s;hades, the &s;hapele&s;s BEAR,</L>
<L>With dangling ice all horrid, &s;talks forlorn;</L>
<L>Slow pac'd, and &s;ourer as the &s;torms increa&s;e.</L>
<L>He makes his bed beneath th' inclement drift,</L>
<L>And with &s;tern patience, &s;corning weak complaint,</L>
<L>Hardens his heart again&s;t a&s;&s;ailing want.</L></Q>
Tho&s;e of the &s;outhern parts dwell in the hollows of antient trees. The hunter di&s;covers them by &s;triking with an ax the tree he &s;u&s;pects they are lodged in, then &s;uddenly conceals him&s;elf. The Bear is immediately rouzed, looks out of the hollow to learn the cau&s;e of the alarm; &s;eeing none, &s;inks again into repo&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Du Pratz, <HI>ii. 61.</HI></NOTE>. The hunter then forces him out, by flinging in fired reeds; and &s;hoots him while he de&s;cends the body of the tree, which, notwith&s;tanding his aukward appearance, he does with great agility; nor is he le&s;s nimble in a&s;cending the tops of the highe&s;t trees in &s;earch of berries and fruits.</P>
<P>The long time which the&s;e animals &s;ub&s;i&s;t without food is amaz|ing. They will continue in their retreat for &s;ix weeks without the le&s;t provi&s;ion, remaining either a&s;leep or totally inactive. It is pretend|ed that they live by &s;ucking their paws; but that is a vulgar error. The fact is, they retire immediately after autumn, when they have fattened them&s;elves to an exce&s;&s;ive degree by the abundance of the fruits which they find at that &s;ea&s;on. This enables ani|mals, which per&s;pire very little in a &s;tate of re&s;t, to endure an ab&s;ti|nence of uncommon length. But when this internal &s;upport is ex|hau&s;ted, and they begin to feel the call of hunger, on the approach of the &s;evere &s;ea&s;on, they quit their dens in &s;earch of food. Multitudes

<P>All who have ta&s;ted the fle&s;h of this animal &s;ay, that it is mo&s;t de|licious eating: a young Bear, fattened with the autumnal fruits, is a di&s;h fit for the nice&s;t epicure.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHASE.</NOTE>The cha&s;e of the&s;e animals is a matter of the fir&s;t importance, and never undertaken without abundance of ceremony. A principal warrior fir&s;t gives a general invitation to all the hunters. This is followed by a mo&s;t &s;erious fa&s;t of eight days, a total ab&s;tinence from all kinds of food; notwith&s;tanding which, they pa&s;s the day in continual &s;ong. This they do to invoke the &s;pirits of the woods to direct them to the place where there are abundance of bears. They even cut the fle&s;h in divers parts of their bodies, to render the &s;pirits more propitious. They al&s;o addre&s;s them&s;elves to the <HI>manes</HI> of the bea&s;ts &s;lain in preceding cha&s;es, as if it were to direct them in their dreams to plenty of game. One dreamer alone cannot determine
<PB N="63" REF="285">
the place of cha&s;e, numbers mu&s;t concur; but, as they tell each other their dreams, they never fail to agree: whether that may ari&s;e from complai&s;ance, or by a real agreement in the dreams from their thoughts being perpetually turned on the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P>The chief of the hunt now gives a great fea&s;t, at which no one dares to appear without fir&s;t bathing. At this entertainment they eat with great moderation, contrary to their u&s;ual cu&s;tom. The ma&s;ter of the fea&s;t alone touches nothing; but is employed in relating to the gue&s;ts antient tales of the wonderful feats in former cha&s;es: and fre&s;h invocations to the manes of the decea&s;ed bears conclude the whole. They then &s;ally forth amid&s;t the acclamations of the village, equipped as if for war, and painted black. Every able hunter is on a level with a great warrior; but he mu&s;t have killed his dozen great bea&s;ts before his character is e&s;tabli&s;hed: after which his alliance is as much courted as that of the mo&s;t valiant captain.</P>
<P>They now proceed on their way in a direct line: neither rivers, mar&s;hes, or any other impediments, &s;top their cour&s;e; driving before them all the bea&s;ts which they find in their way. When they arrive in the hunting-ground, they &s;urround as large a &s;pace as their com|pany will admit, and then contract their circle; &s;earching, as they contract, every hollow tree, and every place fit for the retreat of the bear, and continue the &s;ame practice till the time of the cha&s;e is ex|pired.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as a bear is killed, a hunter puts into its mouth a lighted pipe of tobacco, and, blowing into it, fills the throat with the &s;moke, conjuring the &s;pirit of the animal not to re&s;ent what they are going to do to its body; nor to render their future cha&s;es un&s;ucce&s;sful. As the bea&s;t makes no reply, they cut out the &s;tring of the tongue, and throw it into the fire: if it crackles and runs in (which it is al|mo&s;t &s;ure to do) they accept it as a good omen; if not, they con&s;ider that the &s;pirit of the bea&s;t is not appea&s;ed, and that the cha&s;e of the next year will be unfortunate.</P>
<P>The hunters live well during the cha&s;e, on provi&s;ions which they bring with them. They return, home with great pride and &s;elf-&s;ufficiency;
<PB N="64" REF="286">
for to kill a bear forms the character of a complete man. They again give a great entertainment, and now make a point to leave nothing. The fea&s;t is dedicated to a certain genius, perhaps that of Gluttony, who&s;e re&s;entment they dread, if they do not eat every mor&s;el, and even &s;up up the very melted grea&s;e in which the meat was dre&s;&s;ed. They &s;ometimes eat till they bur&s;t, or bring on them&s;elves &s;ome violent di&s;orders. The fir&s;t cour&s;e is the greate&s;t bear they have killed, without even taking out the entrails, or taking off the &s;kin, contenting them&s;elves with &s;ingeing the &s;kin, as is prac|ti&s;ed with hogs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Charlevoix,</HI> v. 169 to 174.</NOTE>.</P>

They never call the two former by their proper name, but by that of <HI>Si|pang,</HI> or <HI>ill-luck.</HI></P>
<P>At pre&s;ent the <HI>Kamt&s;chatkans</HI> kill the bear and other wild bea&s;ts with guns: formerly they had variety of inventions; &s;uch as filling the entrance of its den with logs, and then digging down upon the ani|mal and de&s;troying it with &s;pears<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Hi&s;t.

<P>The killing of a Bear was reckoned as great an exploit in <HI>Lapland</HI> as it was in <HI>America,</HI> and the hero was held in the highe&s;t e&s;teem by both &s;exes; and, by a &s;ingular cu&s;tom, was forbid all commerce with his wife for three days. The <HI>Laplanders</HI> bring home the &s;lain bea&s;ts in great triumph. They erect a new tent near their former dwelling, but never enter it till they have flung off the dre&s;s of the cha&s;e.

<P>The hairs on the head, back, and belly, are of the &s;ame colors, but much finer and &s;ofter. Before they are examined, the animal ap|pears wholly black. The throat whiti&s;h, marked with black.

<P>It preys indifferently on all animals which it can ma&s;ter. It feeds by night, and, being &s;low of foot, follows the track of wolves and foxes in the &s;now, in order to come in for &s;hare of their prey. It will dig up the carca&s;es of animals, and the provi&s;ions concealed by the
<PB N="68" REF="290">
hunt&s;men deep in the &s;now, which it will carry away to other places to devour. About the <HI>Lena</HI> it will attack hor&s;es, on who&s;e backs are often &s;een the marks of its teeth and claws. By a wonderful &s;a|gacity it will a&s;cend a tree, and fling from the boughs a &s;pecies of mo&s;s which Elks and Reins are very fond of; and when tho&s;e ani|mals come beneath to feed on it, will fall on them and de&s;troy them: or, like the Lynx, it a&s;cends to the boughs of trees, and falls on the Deer which ca&s;ually pa&s;s beneath, and adheres till they fall down with fatigue. It is a great enemy to the Beaver<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dobbs, <HI>40.</HI></NOTE>, and is on that ac|count &s;ometimes called the <HI>Beaver-eater.</HI> It watches at the mouth of their holes, and catches them as they come out.

<P>It is &s;uppo&s;ed that they bring but one at a time. They go be|tween eight and nine months with young, and &s;uckle it almo&s;t the whole year. The young never quits its dam till it takes a mate. They are monogamous, and very con&s;tant.</P>
<P>They bring forth on land: often carry the young between their teeth, fondle them, and frequently fling them up and catch them again in their paws. Before the young can &s;wim, the old ones will take them in their fore feet, and &s;wim about upon their backs.</P>

But the&s;e methods are u&s;ed only in &s;ummer, and not much practi&s;ed; for the &s;kins in that &s;ea&s;on are far le&s;s valuable than in the winter. At that time they are taken in nets placed above and below their hou&s;es, acro&s;s the creeks, on &s;takes. If the water is frozen, the ice is cut from &s;hore to &s;hore, in order to put down the &s;takes. When the net is &s;et, the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;end their women to the Beaver-hou&s;es to di&s;turb the animals; who dart into the water, and are u&s;ually taken in the net, which is in&s;tantly hauled up; and put down again with all expedition. If the Beaver mi&s;&s;es the net, it &s;ometimes returns to its hou&s;e, but oftener into the vaults on the &s;ides of the banks; but the poor creature &s;eldom e&s;capes, be|ing pur&s;ued into all his retreats, the hou&s;es being broke open, and the vaults &s;earched by digging along the &s;hores.</P>
<P>The value of the fur of the&s;e animals, in the manufacture of hats, is well known. It began to be in u&s;e in <HI>England</HI> in the reign of <HI>Charles</HI> I.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer's Faedera, <HI>xx. 230.</HI></NOTE>, when the manufacture was regulated, in 1638, by procla|mation; in which is an expre&s;s prohibition of u&s;ing any materials ex|cept <HI>Beaver &s;tuff,</HI> or <HI>Beaver wool;</HI> and the hats called demi-ca&s;tors were forbidden to be made, unle&s;s for exportation.</P>
<P>This cau&s;ed a va&s;t encrea&s;e of demand for the &s;kins of the Beavers. The <HI>Indians,</HI> on the di&s;covery of <HI>America,</HI> &s;eem to have paid very

little attention to them, amid&s;t the va&s;t variety of bea&s;ts they at that time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, both for food and cloathing. But about the period of the fa&s;hion of hats, they became an article of commerce, and object of cha&s;e. The &s;outhern colonies &s;oon became exhau&s;ted of their Beavers; and of later years the traffic has been much confined to <HI>Ca|nada</HI> and <HI>Hud&s;on's Bay.</HI> The importance of this trade, and the ra|vages made among the animal creation in tho&s;e parts, will appear by the following &s;tate of the imports into the ports of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Rochelle</HI> in 1743.

<P>This great balance in favor of the <HI>French</HI> ari&s;es not only from their &s;uperior hone&s;ty in their dealings with the ignorant <HI>Indians,</HI> but the advantageous &s;ituation of <HI>Canada</HI> for the fur trade.

<P>The traffic carried on in <HI>Hud&s;on's Bay</HI> is chiefly brought from the chain of lakes and rivers that empty them&s;elves into the bay at <HI>Nel&s;on</HI>'s river, running &s;outherly from lat. 56 to lat. 45.

Like the Beaver, it forms its hou&s;e of a round &s;hape, covered with a dome, and con&s;tructed with herbs and reeds cemented with clay. At the bottom and &s;ides are &s;everal pipes, through which they pa&s;s in &s;earch of food; for they do not lay in a &s;tock of provi&s;ion, like the former. They al&s;o form &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages, into which they retreat whenever their hou&s;es are attacked.</P>
<P>The&s;e hou&s;es are only intended for winter habitations; are de&s;erted, and rebuilt annually. During &s;ummer, they live in pairs, and bring forth their young from three to &s;ix at a time. At approach of win|ter, they con&s;truct their hou&s;es, and retire into them, in order to be protected from the inclemency of the &s;ea&s;on. Several families occupy the &s;ame dwelling, which is oft-times covered many feet with &s;now and ice; but they creep out and feed on the roots which lie beneath. They are very fond of the <HI>Acorus Verus,</HI> or <HI>Calamus Aromaticus</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Law&s;on, <HI>120.</HI></NOTE>. This perhaps gives them that &s;trong mu&s;ky &s;mell the&s;e animals are &s;o remarkable for; which they lo&s;e during winter, probably when this &s;pecies of plant is not to be got. They al&s;o feed on the fre&s;h-water Mu&s;&s;els. They feed too on fruit; for <HI>Kalm</HI> &s;ays, that apples are the baits u&s;ed for them in traps.

The&s;e, and the other &s;pecies of Squirrels, are the greate&s;t pe&s;ts to the farmers of <HI>North America.</HI> They &s;warm in &s;e|veral of the provinces, and often de&s;cend in troops from the back &s;ettlements, and join the re&s;t in their ravages on the plantations of mayz, and the various nuts and ma&s;t which that fertile country produces.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e which migrate from the mountains generally arrive in au|tumn; in&s;tantly clear the ground of the fallen acorns, nuts, and ma&s;t, and form with them magazines for their winter provi&s;ions, in holes which they dig under ground for that purpo&s;e. They are often robbed of their hoards; for the coloni&s;ts take great pains to find them out; and oft-times the hogs, which rove about the woods, root up and devour their magazines. It is from the&s;e that they &s;upply them&s;elves, from time to time, with provi&s;ions, quitting their ne&s;ts, and returning with a &s;ufficient &s;tock to la&s;t them for &s;ome &s;pace; it being ob&s;erved, that during winter they do not care to quit their warm retreat, unle&s;s on a vi&s;it to their &s;torehou&s;es; therefore, when|ever they are ob&s;erved to run about the woods in greater numbers than u&s;ual, it is a certain &s;ign of the near approach of &s;evere cold; for in&s;tinct directs them to lay in a greater &s;tock than u&s;ual, lea&s;t the inclemency of the weather &s;hould deprive them of acce&s;s to their &s;ubterraneous magazines.</P>
<P>The damage which they do to the poor planters, by de&s;troying the mayz, is incredible. They come by hundreds into the fields, climb up the &s;talks, and eat the &s;weet corn wrapt up in the heads, and will de&s;troy a whole plantation in a night. For this rea&s;on they were pro&s;cribed. In &s;ome places the inhabitants were, each, obliged an|nually to bring in four Squirrels heads. In others, a &s;um was given,
<PB N="118" REF="339">
about three pence, for every one that was killed. This proved &s;uch an encouragement, as to &s;et all the idle people in the province in pur&s;uit of them. <HI>Pen&s;ylvania</HI> paid, from <HI>January</HI> 1749 to <HI>January</HI> 1750, 8000l. currency: but on complaint being made by the depu|ties, that their trea&s;uries were exhau&s;ted by the&s;e rewards, they were reduced to one half. How improved mu&s;t the &s;tate of the <HI>Americans</HI> then be, in thirty-five years, to wage an expen&s;ive and &s;ucce&s;sful war again&s;t its parent country, which before could not bear the charges of clearing the provinces from the ravages of the&s;e in&s;ignificant ani|mals!</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved, that the Squirrels are greatly multiplied within the&s;e few years, and that in proportion to the encrea&s;e of the fields of mayz, which attract them from all parts; I mean not only the grey &s;pecies, but all the others.</P>
<P>They are eaten by &s;ome people, and are e&s;teemed very delicate. Their &s;kins, in <HI>America,</HI> are u&s;ed for ladies &s;hoes; and are often im|ported into <HI>England,</HI> for lining or facing for cloaks.</P>
<P>They make their ne&s;ts in hollow trees, with mo&s;s, &s;traw, wool, and other warm materials. They chiefly inhabit trees of the deciduous kind; but &s;ometimes in pines, who&s;e cones are an article of their provi&s;ion. They keep their ne&s;ts for &s;everal days together, &s;eldom &s;tirring out, except for a fre&s;h &s;upply of food. Should a deep &s;now prevent them from getting to their &s;torehou&s;es, multitudes peri&s;h with hunger.</P>
<P>When they are &s;itting on a bough, and perceive a man, they in|&s;tantly move their tails backward and forward, and gna&s;h their teeth with a very con&s;iderable noi&s;e. This makes them dete&s;ted by the &s;port&s;men, who lo&s;e their game by the alarm they give. The GREY Squirrel is a difficult animal to kill: it &s;its on the highe&s;t trees, and often between the boughs, and changes its place with &s;uch expedi|tion that the quicke&s;t mark&s;man can &s;carcely find time to level his piece; and if it can once get into a hole, or into any old ne&s;t, nothing
<PB N="119" REF="340">
can provoke it to get out of its a&s;ylum. They run up and down the bodies of trees, but very rarely leap from one to the other.</P>
<P>They are ea&s;ily made tame; will even be brought to play with cats and dogs, which in a &s;tate of dome&s;ticity will not hurt them. They will al&s;o attach them&s;elves &s;o far as to follow children to and from the woods.</P>

Near the chamber they often form other caverns, in which they lodge their winter &s;tores: the&s;e con&s;i&s;t of various kinds of plants, even &s;ome of &s;pecies poi&s;onous to mankind. They gather them in &s;um|mer, harve&s;t them, and even at times bring them out of the cells to give them a more thorough drying in the &s;un. The chief labor re&s;ts on the females. The males, during &s;ummer, go about &s;olitary, and inhabit &s;ome old ne&s;ts; and in that &s;ea&s;on never touch their hoards, but live on berries. They are monogamous, and the male and female at other times found in the &s;ame ne&s;t. The female brings two or three young at a time, and breeds often in the year.</P>

They gather together in the &s;pring in amazing numbers, except the few that are conver&s;ant about villages, where they can pick up &s;ome &s;ub&s;i&s;tance. This makes it probable that the country is over-&s;tocked, and they quit it for want of food. The mighty ho&s;t proceeds in a direct cour&s;e we&s;t|ward, and with the utmo&s;t intrepidity &s;wims over rivers, lakes, and even arms of the &s;ea: many are drowned, many de&s;troyed by water|fowl, or rapacious fi&s;h; tho&s;e which e&s;cape re&s;t awhile, to ba&s;k, dry their fur, and refre&s;h them&s;elves.

As &s;oon as they have cro&s;&s;ed the river <HI>Pen&s;chim,</HI> at the head of the gulph of the &s;ame name, they turn &s;outhward, and reach the rivers <HI>Judoma</HI> and <HI>Ochot</HI> by the middle of <HI>July.</HI> The &s;pace is mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing, on con&s;ulting the map of the country.

<P><Q>In a few weeks they a&s;&s;emble in great multitudes: formerly, when undi&s;turbed by the <HI>Americans,</HI> to the amount of &s;even or eight thou&s;and. The form of the <HI>Echouerie</HI> not allowing them to re|main contiguous to the water, the foremo&s;t are in&s;en&s;ibly pu&s;hed above the &s;lope. When they are arrived at a convenient di&s;tance, the hunters, being provided with a &s;pear &s;harp on one &s;ide, like a knife, with which they cut their throats, take advantage of a &s;ide wind, or a breeze blowing obliquely upon the &s;hore, to prevent the animals from &s;melling them, becau&s;e they have that &s;en&s;e in great perfection. Having landed, the hunters, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of good dogs, trained for that purpo&s;e, in the night-time endea|vour to &s;eparate tho&s;e which are mo&s;t advanced from the others, driving them different ways.

<P>The&s;e animals may be called the flocks of the <HI>Greenlanders,</HI> and many other of the Arctic people. I cannot de&s;cribe the u&s;es of them to the former more expre&s;&s;ively than in the very words of Mr. <HI>Crantz,</HI> a gentleman very long re&s;ident in their chilly country.</P>
<Q><P>Seals are more needful to them than Sheep are to us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THEIR GREAT USE TO THE GREENLANDERS.</NOTE> though they furni&s;h us with food and raiment; or than the cocoa-tree is to the <HI>Indians,</HI> although that pre&s;ents them not only with meat to eat, and covering for their bodies, but al&s;o hou&s;es to dwell in, and boats to fail in, &s;o that in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity they could live &s;olely from it. The Seals fle&s;h (together with the Rein-deer, which is already grown pretty &s;carce) &s;upplies the natives with their mo&s;t palatable and &s;ub|&s;tantial food. Their fat furni&s;hes them with oil for lamp-light, cham|ber and kitchen fire; and whoever &s;ees their habitations, pre&s;ently
<PB N="152" REF="373">
finds, that if they even had a &s;uperfluity of wood, it would not do, they can u&s;e nothing but train in them. They al&s;o mollify their dry food, mo&s;tly fi&s;h, in the train; and finally, they barter it for all kinds of nece&s;&s;aries with the factor. They can few better with fibres of the Seals &s;inews than with thread or &s;ilk. Of the &s;kins of the entrails they make their windows, curtains for their tents, &s;hirts, and part of the bladders they u&s;e at their harpoons; and they make train bottles of the maw. Formerly, for want of iron, they made all manner of in&s;truments and working-tools of their bones. Neither is the blood wa&s;ted, but boiled with other ingre|dients, and eaten as &s;oup. Of the &s;kin of the Seal they &s;tand in the greate&s;t need; for, &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;kins of Rein-deer and birds would furni&s;h them with competent cloathing for their bodies, and coverings for their beds; and their fle&s;h, together with fi&s;h, with &s;ufficient food; and provided they could dre&s;s their meat with wood, and al&s;o new model their hou&s;e-keeping, &s;o as to have light, and keep them&s;elves warm with it too; yet without the Seals &s;kins they would not be in a capacity of acquiring the&s;e &s;ame Rein-deer, fowls, fi&s;hes, and wood; becau&s;e they mu&s;t cover over with Seal-&s;kin both their large and &s;mall boats, in which they travel and &s;eek their provi&s;ion. They mu&s;t al&s;o cut their thongs or &s;traps out of them, make the bladders for their harpoons, and cover their tents with them; without which they could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t in &s;ummer.</P>
<P>Therefore no man can pa&s;s for a right <HI>Greenlander</HI> who cannot catch Seals. This is the ultimate end they a&s;pire at, in all their device and labor from their childhood up. It is the only art (and in truth a difficult and dangerous one it is) to which they are trained from their infancy; by which they maintain them&s;elves, make them&s;elves agreeable to others, and become beneficial mem|bers of the community<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Greenl. <HI>i. 130.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="374">The <HI>Greenlanders</HI> have three ways of catching Seals:<NOTE PLACE="marg">MANNER OF TAKING.</NOTE> either &s;ing|ly, with the bladder; or in company, by the <HI>clapper-hunt;</HI> or in the winter on the ice: whereto may be added the &s;hooting them with a gun.</P>
<P>The principal and mo&s;t common way is the taking them with the bladder. When the <HI>Greenlander</HI> &s;ets out equipped according to the 7th Section, and &s;pies a Seal, he tries to &s;urpri&s;e it una|wares, with the wind and &s;un in his back, that he may not be heard or &s;een by it. He tries to conceal him&s;elf behind a wave, and makes ha&s;tily, but &s;oftly, up to it, till he comes within four, five, or &s;ix fathom of it; mean while he takes the utmo&s;t care that the harpoon, line, and bladder, lie in proper order. Then he takes hold of the oar with his left hand, and the harpoon with his right by the hand-board, and &s;o away he throws it at the Seal, in &s;uch a manner that the whole dart flies from the hand-board and leaves that in his hand. If the harpoon hits the mark, and buries it&s;elf deeper than the barbs, it will directly di&s;engage it&s;elf from the bone-joint, and that from the &s;haft; and al&s;o un|wind the &s;tring from its lodge on the <HI>kajak.</HI> The moment the Seal is pierced, the <HI>Greenlander</HI> mu&s;t throw the bladder, tied to the end of the &s;tring, into the water, on the &s;ame &s;ide as the Seal runs and dives; for that he does in&s;tantly, like a dart. Then the <HI>Greenlander</HI> goes and takes up the &s;haft &s;wimming on the water, and lays it in its place. The Seal often drags the bladder with it under water, though 'tis a con&s;iderable impediment, on account of its great bigne&s;s; but it &s;o wearies it&s;elf out with it, that it mu&s;t come up again in about a quarter of an hour to take breath. The <HI>Greenlander</HI> ha&s;tens to the &s;pot where he &s;ees the bladder ri&s;e up, and &s;mites the Seal, as &s;oon as it appears, with the great lance de&s;cribed in the 6th Section<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Sections referred to, and tab. v.</NOTE>. This lance always comes out of its body again; but he throws it at the creature afre&s;h every time it comes up, till 'tis quite &s;pent. Then he runs the
<PB N="154" REF="375">
little lance into it, and kills it outright, but &s;tops up the wound directly to pre&s;erve the blood; and la&s;tly, he blows it up, like a bladder, betwixt &s;kin and fle&s;h, to put it into a better capacity of &s;wimming after him; for which purpo&s;e he fa&s;tens it to the left-&s;ide of his <HI>kajak,</HI> or boat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See vol. i. 150. tab. viii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In this exerci&s;e the <HI>Greenlander</HI> is expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t and greate&s;t danger of his life; which is probably the rea&s;on that they call this hunt, or fi&s;hery, <HI>kamavock,</HI> i. e. the Extinction, <HI>viz.</HI> of life. For if the line &s;hould entangle it&s;elf, as it ea&s;ily may, in its &s;ud|den and violent motion; or if it &s;hould catch hold of the <HI>kajak,</HI> or &s;hould wind it&s;elf round the oar, or the hand, or even the neck, as it &s;ometimes does in windy weather; or if the Seal &s;hould turn &s;uddenly to the other &s;ide of the boat; it cannot be otherwi&s;e than that the <HI>kajak</HI> mu&s;t be overturned by the &s;tring, and drawn down under water. On &s;uch de&s;perate occa&s;ions the poor <HI>Greenlander</HI> &s;tands in need of all the arts de&s;cribed in the former Section, to di&s;entangle him&s;elf from the &s;tring, and to rai&s;e him&s;elf up from under the water &s;everal times &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; for he will continually be overturning till he has quite di&s;engaged him&s;elf from the line. Nay, when he imagines him&s;elf to be out of all danger, and comes too near the dying Seal, it may &s;till bite him in the face or hand; and a female Seal that has young, in&s;tead of flying the field, will &s;ometimes fly at the <HI>Greenlander</HI> in the mo&s;t vehement rage, and do him a mi&s;chief, or bite a hole in his <HI>kajak</HI> that he mu&s;t &s;ink.</P>
<P>In this way, &s;ingly, they can kill none but the carele&s;s &s;tupid Seal, called <HI>Attar&s;oak</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See N^o 77. of this work.</NOTE>. Several in company mu&s;t pur&s;ue the cautious <HI>Ka&s;&s;igiak</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ditto, N^o 72.</NOTE> by the <HI>clapper-hunt.</HI> In the &s;ame manner they al&s;o &s;urround and kill the <HI>Attar&s;oit</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ditto, a variety of N^o 77.</NOTE> in great numbers at certain &s;ea&s;ons of the year; for in autumn they retire into the creeks or inlets in &s;tormy weather, as in the <HI>Nepi&s;et</HI> &s;ound in <HI>Ball</HI>'s river, between the main land and the i&s;land <HI>Kangek,</HI> which is full two
<PB N="155" REF="376">
leagues long, but very narrow. There the <HI>Greenlanders</HI> cut off their retreat, and frighten them under water by &s;houting, clapping, and throwing &s;tones; but, as they mu&s;t come up again continually to draw breath, then they per&s;ecute them again till they are tired, and at la&s;t are obliged to &s;tay &s;o long above water, that they &s;ur|round them, and kill them with the fourth kind of dart, de&s;cribed in the 6th Section. During this hunt we have a fine opportunity to &s;ee the agility of the <HI>Greenlanders,</HI> or, if I may call it &s;o, their hu&s;&s;ar-like manoeuvres. When the Seal ri&s;es out of the water, they all fly upon it, as if they had wings, with a de&s;perate noi&s;e; the poor creature is forced to dive again directly, and the moment he does, they di&s;per&s;e again as fa&s;t as they came, and every one gives heed to his po&s;t, to &s;ee where it will &s;tart up again; which is an uncertain thing, and is commonly three quarters of a mile from the former &s;pot. If a Seal has a good broad water, three or four leagues each way, it can keep the &s;port&s;men in play for a couple of hours, before 'tis &s;o &s;pent that they can &s;urround and kill it. If the Seal, in its fright, betakes it&s;elf to the land for a retreat, 'tis welcomed with &s;ticks and &s;tones by the women and children, and pre&s;ently pierced by the men in the rear. This is a very lively and a very profitable diver&s;ion for the <HI>Greenlanders,</HI> for many times one man will have eight or ten Seals for his &s;hare.</P>
<P>The third method of killing Seals upon the ice, is mo&s;tly prac|ti&s;ed in <HI>Di&s;ko,</HI> where the bays are frozen over in the winter. There are &s;everal ways of proceeding. The Seals them&s;elves make &s;ometimes holes in the ice, where they come and draw breath; near &s;uch a hole a <HI>Greenlander</HI> &s;eats him&s;elf on a &s;tool, putting his feet on a lower one to keep them from the cold. Now when the Seal comes and puts its no&s;e to the hole, he pierces it in|&s;tantly with his harpoon; then breaks the hole larger, and draws it out and kills it quite. Or a <HI>Greenlander</HI> lays him&s;elf upon his belly, on a kind of a &s;ledge, near other holes, where the Seal
<PB N="156" REF="377">
come out upon the ice to ba&s;k them&s;elves in the &s;un. Near this great hole they make a little one, and another <HI>Greenlander</HI> puts a harpoon into it with a very long &s;haft or pole. He that lies upon the ice looks into the great hole, till he &s;ees a Seal com|ing under the harpoon; then he gives the other the &s;ignal, who runs the Seal through with all his might.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Greenlander</HI> &s;ees a Seal lying near its hole upon the ice, he &s;lides along upon his belly towards it, wags his head, and grunts like a Seal; and the poor Seal, thinking 'tis one of its in|nocent companions, lets him come near enough to pierce it with his long dart.</P>
<P>When the current wears a great hole in the ice in the &s;pring, the <HI>Greenlanders</HI> plant them&s;elves all round it, till the Seals come in droves to the brim to fetch breath, and then they kill them with their harpoons. Many al&s;o are killed on the ice while they lie &s;leeping and &s;noring in the &s;un<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">pp. 153, 4, 5, 6, 7.</NOTE>.</P></Q>
<P>Nature has been &s;o niggardly in providing variety of provi&s;ion for the <HI>Greenlanders,</HI> that they are nece&s;&s;itated to have recour&s;e to &s;uch which is offered to them with a liberal hand.<NOTE PLACE="marg">USES IN KAMT|SCHATKA.</NOTE> The <HI>Kamt&s;chatkan</HI> na|tions, which enjoy &s;everal animals, as well as a great and abundant choice of fi&s;h, are &s;o enamoured with the ta&s;te of the fat of Seals, that they can make no fea&s;t without making it one of the di&s;hes. Of that both <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Kamt&s;chatkans</HI> make their candles. The latter eat the fle&s;h boiled, or el&s;e dried in the &s;un. If they have a great quantity, they pre&s;erve it in the following manner:</P>
<P>They dig a pit of a requi&s;ite depth, and pave it with &s;tones; then fill it with wood, and &s;et it on fire &s;o as to heat the pit to the warmth of a &s;tove. They then collect all the cinders into a heap. They &s;trew the bottom with the green wood of alder, on which they place &s;eparately the fle&s;h and the fat, and put between every layer branches of the &s;ame tree; when the pit is filled they cover it with &s;ods, &s;o that the vapour cannot e&s;cape. After &s;ome hours they take out both
<PB N="157" REF="378">
fat and fle&s;h, and keep it for winter's provi&s;ions, and they may be pre&s;erved a whole year without &s;poiling.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kamt&s;chatkans</HI> have a mo&s;t &s;ingular ceremony.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SUPERSTITIOUS CUSTOM.</NOTE> After they take the fle&s;h from the heads of the Seals, they bring a ve&s;&s;el in form of a canoe, and fling into it all the &s;culls, crowned with certain herbs, and place them on the ground. A certain per&s;on enters the habita|tion with a &s;ack filled with <HI>Tonchitche,</HI> &s;weet herbs, and a little of the bark of willow. Two of the natives then roll a great &s;tone towards the door, and cover it with pebbles; two others take the &s;weet herbs and di&s;po&s;e them, tied in little packets. The great &s;tone is to &s;ignify the &s;ea-&s;hore, the pebbles the waves, and the packets Seals. They then bring three di&s;hes of a ha&s;h, called <HI>Tolkoucha;</HI> of this they make little balls, in the middle of which they &s;tick the packets of herbs: of the willow-bark they make a little canoe, and fill it with <HI>Tolkoucha,</HI> and cover it with the &s;ack. After &s;ome time, the two <HI>Kamt&s;chatkans</HI> who had put the mimic Seals into the <HI>Tolkoucha,</HI> take the balls, and a ve&s;&s;el re&s;embling a canoe, and draw it along the &s;and, as if it was on the &s;ea, to convince the real Seals how agreeable it would be to them to come among the <HI>Kamt&s;chatkans,</HI> who have a &s;ea in their very <HI>jurts,</HI> or dwellings. And this they imagine will in|duce the Seals to &s;uffer them&s;elves to be taken in great numbers.

To &s;upport my other opinion, I can call in the faithful <HI>Dampier;</HI> who de&s;cribes the body as perfectly &s;mooth<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Voy.</HI> i. 33.</NOTE>: had it that &s;triking inte|gument which the &s;pecies in que&s;tion has, it could not have e&s;caped his notice. Let me al&s;o add, that the &s;ize of tho&s;e which that able &s;eaman ob&s;erved, did not exceed ten or twelve feet; nor the weight of the large&s;t reach that of twelve hundred pounds<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I &s;u&s;pect that this &s;pecies extends to <HI>Mindanao,</HI> for one kind is cer|tainly found there<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Dampier, <HI>i. 321.</HI></NOTE>. It is met with much farther &s;outh; for I di&s;|cover, in the collection of Sir JOSEPH BANKS, a &s;ketch of one taken near <HI>Diego Rodriguez,</HI> vulgarly called <HI>Diego Rais,</HI> an i&s;le to the ea&s;t of <HI>Mauritius;</HI> and it may po&s;&s;ibly have found its way through &s;ome northern inlet to the &s;eas of <HI>Greenland;</HI> for Mr. <HI>Fabricius</HI> once di&s;|covered in that country the head of one, half con&s;umed, with teeth, exactly agreeing with tho&s;e of this &s;pecies<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Foun. Greenl.</HI> p. 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals frequent the &s;hallow and &s;andy parts of the &s;hores,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MANNERS.</NOTE> and near the mouths of the &s;mall rivers of the i&s;land of <HI>Bering,</HI> &s;eem|ingly plea&s;ed with the &s;weet water. They go in herds: the old keep behind and drive their young before them: and &s;ome keep on their &s;ides, by way of protection. On the ri&s;ing of the tide they
<PB N="180" REF="401">
approach the &s;hores, and are &s;o tame as to &s;uffer them&s;elves to be &s;troked: if they are roughly treated, they move towards the &s;ea; but &s;oon forget the injury, and return.</P>
<P>They live in families near one another: each con&s;i&s;ts of a male and female, a half-grown young, and a new-born one. The families often unite, &s;o as to form va&s;t droves. They are monogamous. They bring forth a &s;ingle young, but have no particular time of par|turition; but chiefly, as <HI>Steller</HI> imagines, about <HI>autumn.</HI></P>
<P>They are mo&s;t innocent and harmle&s;s in their manners, and mo&s;t &s;trongly attached to one another. When one is hooked, the whole herd will attempt its re&s;cue: &s;ome will &s;trive to over&s;et the boat, by going beneath it; others will fling them&s;elves on the rope of the hook and pre&s;s it down, in order to break it; and others again will make the utmo&s;t efforts to force the in&s;trument out of its wounded companion.</P>
<P>Their conjugal affection is mo&s;t exemplary: a male, after u&s;ing all its endeavours to relea&s;e its mate which had been &s;truck, pur&s;ued it to the very edge of the water; no blows could force it away. As long as the decea&s;ed female continued in the water, he per&s;i&s;ted in his attendance; and even for three days after &s;he was drawn on &s;hore, and even cut up and carried away, was ob&s;erved to remain, as if in expectation of her return.</P>
<P>They are mo&s;t voracious creatures, and feed with their head under water, quite inattentive of the boats, or any thing that pa&s;&s;es about them; moving and &s;wimming gently after one another, with much of their back above water. A &s;pecies of lou&s;e harbours in the roughne&s;s of their coats, which the Gulls pick out, &s;itting on them as Crows do on Hogs and Sheep. Every now and then they lift their no&s;e out of the water to take breath, and make a noi&s;e like the &s;nort|ing of Hor&s;es. When the tide retires, they &s;wim away along with it; but &s;ometimes the young are left a&s;hore till the return of the water: otherwi&s;e they never quit that element: &s;o that in nature, as well as form, they approach the cetaceous animals, and are the link between Seals and them.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="402">They were taken on <HI>Bering</HI>'s i&s;le by a great hook fa&s;tened to a long rope. Four or five people took it with them in a boat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CAPTURE.</NOTE> and rowed amid&s;t a herd. The &s;tronge&s;t man took the in&s;trument, &s;truck it into the neare&s;t animal; which done, thirty people on &s;hore &s;eized the rope, and with great difficulty drew it on &s;hore. The poor crea|ture makes the &s;tronge&s;t re&s;i&s;tance, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by its faithful companions. It will cling with its feet to the rocks till it leaves the &s;kin behind; and often great fragments of the cru&s;ty integument fly off before it can be landed. It is an animal full of blood; &s;o that it &s;pouts in amazing quantities from the orifice of the wound.</P>
<P>They have no voice; only, when wounded, emit a deep &s;igh.</P>
<P>They have the &s;en&s;es of &s;ight and hearing very imperfect; or at le&s;t neglect the u&s;e of them.</P>
<P>They are not migratory; for they were &s;een about <HI>Bering</HI>'s i&s;land the whole of the &s;ad ten months which Mr. <HI>Steller</HI> pa&s;&s;ed there after his &s;hipwreck.</P>

<P>It being a &s;pecies very little known, and never well engraven, I &s;hall give a brief de&s;cription, and adjoin an engraving taken from an excellent drawing communicated to me by Dr. <HI>Pallas.</HI></P>
<P>The head is &s;hort: no&s;e blunt: &s;piracle &s;mall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">DESCRIPTION.</NOTE> of the form of a cre&s;cent: eyes very minute: mouth &s;mall: in each &s;ide of each jaw are nine teeth, &s;hort, and rather blunt; tho&s;e of the upper jaw are bent, and hollowed, fitted to receive the teeth of the lower jaw when the mouth is clo&s;ed: pectoral fins nearly of an oval form: beneath the &s;kin may be felt the bones of five fingers, which terminate at the edge of the fin in five very &s;en&s;ible projections. This brings it into the next of rank in the order of beings with the <HI>Manati.</HI> The tail is divided into two lobes, which lie horizontally, but do not fork, except a little at their ba&s;e. The body is oblong, and rather &s;lender, tapering from the back (which is a little elevated) to the tail. It is quite de&s;titute of the dor&s;al fin.</P>
<P>Its length is from twelve to eighteen feet.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">IZE.</NOTE> It makes great u&s;e of its tail in &s;wimming; for it bends that part under it, as a Lob&s;ter does its tail, and works it with &s;uch force as to dart along with the rapidity of an arrow.</P>
