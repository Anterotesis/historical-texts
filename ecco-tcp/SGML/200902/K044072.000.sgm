<HEAD>A Prefatory Addre&s;s TO THE LADIES, &amp;c. of GREAT BRITAIN, IN BEHALF OF THE FRENCH EMIGRANT CLERGY.</HEAD>
<P>IF it be allowed that there may ari&s;e oc|ca&s;ions &s;o extraordinary, that all the le&s;&s;er motives of delicacy ought to vani&s;h before them; it is pre&s;umed that the pre&s;ent emer|gency will in &s;ome mea&s;ure ju&s;tify the har|dine&s;s of an Addre&s;s from a private indivi|dual, who, &s;timulated by the urgency of the ca&s;e, &s;acrifices inferior con&s;iderations
<PB N="iv" REF="4">to the ardent de&s;ire of rai&s;ing further &s;up|plies towards relieving a di&s;tre&s;s as pre&s;&s;ing as it is unexampled.</P>
<P>We are informed by public adverti&s;e|ment, that the large &s;ums already &s;o libe|rally &s;ub&s;cribed for the Emigrant Clergy are almo&s;t exhau&s;ted. Authentic information adds, that multitudes of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Exiles in the i&s;land of Jer&s;ey, are on the point of wanting bread.</P>
<P>Very many to whom this Addre&s;s is made have already contributed. O let them not be weary in well-doing! Many are making generous exertions for the ju&s;t and natural claims of the widows and children of our brave &s;eamen and &s;oldiers. Let it not be &s;aid, that the pre&s;ent is an <HI>interfering</HI> claim. Tho&s;e to whom I write, have bread enough, and to &s;pare. You, who fare &s;ump|tuou&s;ly every day, and yet complain you have little to be&s;tow, let not this bounty be
<PB N="v" REF="5">&s;ubracted from another bounty, but rather from &s;ome &s;uperfluous expence.</P>
<P>The beneficent and right-minded want no arguments to be pre&s;&s;ed upon them; but I write to tho&s;e of every de&s;cription. Luxu|rious habits of living, which really furni&s;h the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with the faire&s;t grounds for application, are too often urged as a motive for withholding a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and produced as a plea for having little to &s;pare. Let her who indulges &s;uch habits, and pleads &s;uch excu&s;es in con&s;equence, reflect, that by retrenching <HI>one</HI> co&s;tly di&s;h from her abundant table, the &s;uperfluities of <HI>one</HI> ex|pen&s;ive de&s;ert, <HI>one</HI> evening's public amu&s;e|ment, &s;he may furni&s;h at lea&s;t a week's &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to more than one per&s;on <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Bowdler's letter &s;tates, that about Six Shillings a week includes the expences of each Prie&s;t at Winche&s;ter.</NOTE>, as liberally bred perhaps as her&s;elf, and who,
<PB N="vi" REF="6">in his own country, may have often ta&s;ted how much more ble&s;&s;ed it is to give than to receive &mdash; to a mini&s;ter of God, who has been long accu&s;tomed to be&s;tow the ncce&s;&s;aries he is now reduced to &s;olicit.</P>
<P>Even your young daughters, whom ma|ternal prudence has not yet furni&s;hed with the means of be&s;towing, may be cheaply taught the fir&s;t rudiments of charity, together with an important le&s;&s;on of oeconomy: they may be taught to &s;acrifice a feather, a &s;et of ribbons, an expen&s;ive ornament, an idle diver&s;ion. And if they are thus in&s;tructed, that there is no true charity without &s;elf|denial, they will <HI>gain</HI> more than they are called upon to <HI>give:</HI> for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of one luxury for a charitable purpo&s;e, is the exerci&s;e of two virtues, and this without any pecuniary expence.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="7">Let the &s;ick and afflicted remember how dreadful it mu&s;t be, to be expo&s;ed to &s;uf|ferings, without one of the alleviations which mitigate <HI>their</HI> affliction. How dreadful it is to be without comforts, without nece&s;&s;aries, without a home,&mdash;<HI>without a country!</HI> While the gay and pro&s;perous would do well to recollect, how &s;uddenly and terribly tho&s;e for whom we plead, were, by the &s;urpri&s;|ing vici&s;&s;itudes of life, thrown from equal heights of gaiety and pro&s;perity. And let tho&s;e who have hu&s;bands, fathers, &s;ons, brothers, or friends, reflect on the uncertain|ties of war, and the revolution of human affairs. It is only by imagining the po&s;&s;i|bility of tho&s;e who are dear to us being placed in the &s;ame calamitous circum&s;tances, that we can obtain an adequate feeling of the woes we are called upon to com|mi&s;erate.</P>
<P>In a di&s;tre&s;s &s;o wide and comprehen&s;ive, many are prevented from giving by that
<PB N="viii" REF="8">common excu&s;e&mdash; "That it is but a drop of water in the ocean." But let them re|flect, that if all the individual drops were withheld, there would be no ocean at all; and the inability to give much ought not, on any occa&s;ion, to be converted into, an excu&s;e for giving nothing. Even moderate circum&s;tances need not plead an exemption. The indu&s;trious trade&s;man will not, even in a political view, be eventually a lo&s;er by his &s;mall contribution. The money rai&s;ed is neither carried out of our country, nor di&s;&s;ipated in luxuries, but returns again to the community; to our &s;hops and to our markets, to procure the bare nece&s;&s;aries of, life.</P>
<P>Some have objected to the difference of <HI>religion</HI> of tho&s;e for whom we &s;olicit. Such an objection hardly de&s;erves a &s;erious an|&s;wer. Surely if the &s;uper&s;titious Tartar hopes to become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the courage and talents of the enemy he &s;lays, the
<PB N="ix" REF="9">Chri&s;tian is not afraid of catching, or of propagating the error of the &s;ufferer he re|lieves.&mdash;Chri&s;tian charity is of no party. We plead not for their faith, but for their wants. And let the more &s;crupulous, who look for de&s;ert as well as di&s;tre&s;s in the ob|jects of their bounty, bear in mind, that if the&s;e men could have &s;acrificed their con&s;ci|ence to their convenience, they had not now been in this country. Let us &s;hew them the purity of <HI>our</HI> religion, by the bene&s;icence of our actions.</P>
<P>If you will permit me to pre&s;s upon you &s;uch high motives, (and it were to be wi&s;hed that in every action we were to be influenced by the highe&s;t,) perhaps no act of bounty to which you may be called out, can ever come &s;o immediately under that &s;olemn and affecting de&s;cription, which will be re|corded in the great day of account,&mdash;<HI>I was a &s;tranger, and ye took me in.&mdash;</HI></P>

<HEAD>The following is an exact Tran&s;lation from a <HI>SPEECH</HI> made in the National Conven|tion at Paris, on Friday the 14th of De|cember 1792, in a Debate on the Subject of e&s;tabli&s;hing Public Schools for the Edu|cation of Youth, by Citizen <HI>DUPONT,</HI> a Member of con&s;iderable Weight; and as the Doctrines contained in it were received with unanimous Applau&s;e, except from two or three of the Clergy, it may be fairly con&s;idered as an Expo&s;ition of the Creed of that Enlightened A&s;&s;embly. Tran&s;lated from <HI>Le Moniteur</HI> of Sunday the 16th of De|cember 1792.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT! Thrones are overturned! Sceptres broken! Kings expire! And yet the Altars of GOD remain! (Here there is a murmur from &s;ome Members; and the Abb&eacute; ICHON demands that the per&s;on &s;peaking may be called to order.)
<PB N="xii" REF="12">Tyrants, in outrage to nature, continue to burn an impious incen&s;e on tho&s;e Altars! (Some murmurs ari&s;e, but they are lo&s;t in the applau&s;es from the majority of the A&s;|&s;embly.) The Thrones that have been re|ver&s;ed, have left the&s;e Altars naked, un&s;up|ported, and tottering. A &s;ingle breath of enlightened rea&s;on will now be &s;ufficient to make them di&s;appear; and if humanity is under obligations to the French nation for the fir&s;t of the&s;e benefits, the fall of Kings, can it be doubted but that the French peo|ple, now &s;overeign, will be wi&s;e enough, in like manner, to overthrow tho&s;e Altars and <HI>tho&s;e Idols</HI> to which tho&s;e Kings have hitherto made them &s;ubject? <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> the&s;e ought to be the gods of men! The&s;e are my gods! (Here the Abb&eacute; AU|DREIN cried out, "There is no bearing this;" and ru&s;hed out of the A&s;&s;embly.&mdash;A great laugh.) Admire <HI>nature</HI>&mdash;cultivate <HI>rea&s;on.</HI>&mdash;And you, Legi&s;lators, if you de|&s;ire that the French people &s;hould be hap|py,
<PB N="xiii" REF="13">make ha&s;te to propagate the&s;e princi|ples, and to teach them in your primary &s;chools, in&s;tead of tho&s;e fanatical principles which have hitherto been taught. The ty|ranny of Kings was confined to make their people mi&s;erable in this life&mdash;but tho&s;e other tyrants, the Prie&s;ts, extend their dominion into another, of which they have no other idea than of eternal puni&s;hments; a doc|trine which &s;ome men have hitherto had the good nature to believe. But the mo|ment of the cata&s;trophe is come&mdash;all the&s;e prejudices mu&s;t fall at the &s;ame time. <HI>We mu&s;t de&s;troy them, or they will de&s;troy us.</HI>&mdash; For my&s;elf, I hone&s;tly avow to the Con|vention, <HI>I am an athei&s;t!</HI> (Here there is &s;ome noi&s;e and tumult. But a great num|ber of members cry out, <Q>What is that to us&mdash;you are an hone&s;t man!</Q>) But I defy a &s;ingle individual, among&s;t the twenty-four millions of Frenchmen, to make again&s;t me any well-grounded re|proach. I doubt whether the Chri&s;tians,
<PB N="xiv" REF="14">or the Catholics, of which the la&s;t &s;peaker, and tho&s;e of his opinion, have been talk|ing to us, can make the &s;ame challenge.&mdash; (Great applau&s;es.) There is another con|&s;ideration&mdash;Paris has had great lo&s;&s;es. It has been deprived of the commerce of lux|ury; of that factitious &s;plendour which was found at courts, and invited &s;trangers hi|ther. Well! We mu&s;t repair the&s;e lo&s;&s;es. &mdash;Let me then repre&s;ent to you the times, that are fa&s;t approaching, when our phi|lo&s;ophers, who&s;e names are celebrated throughout Europe, PETION, SYEYES, CONDORCET, and others&mdash;&s;urrounded in our Pantheon, as the Greek philo&s;ophers were at Athens, with a crowd of di&s;ciples coming from all parts of Europe, walking like the Peripatetics, and teaching&mdash;this man, the &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e, and de|veloping the progre&s;s of all human know|ledge; that, perfectioning the &s;ocial &s;y&s;|tem, and &s;hewing in our decree of the I7th of June 1789, the &s;eeds of the in&s;urrec|tions
<PB N="xv" REF="15">of the 14th of July, and the 10th of Augu&s;t, and of all tho&s;e in&s;urrections which are &s;preading with &s;uch rapidity through|out Europe&mdash;&s;o that the&s;e young &s;trangers, on their return to their re&s;pective countries, may &s;pread the &s;ame lights, and may ope|rate, <HI>for the happine&s;s of mankind,</HI> &s;imilar revolutions throughout the world.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS ON THE SPEECH of Mr. DUPONT, ON THE SUBJECTS OF Religion and Public Education.</HEAD>
<P>IT is pre&s;umed that it may not be thought un&s;ea&s;onable at this critical time to offer to the Public, and e&s;pecially to the more religious part of it, a few &s;light ob&s;erva|tions, occa&s;ioned by the late famous Speech of Mr. Dupont, which exhibits the Con|fe&s;&s;ion of Faith of a con&s;iderable Member of the French National Convention. Though
<PB N="2" REF="17">the Speech it&s;elf has been pretty generally read, yet it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to prefix it to the&s;e Remarks, le&s;t &s;uch as have not already peru&s;ed it, might, from an hone&s;t reluctance to credit the exi&s;tence of &s;uch principles, di&s;pute its authenticity, and ac|cu&s;e the Remarks, if unaccompanied by the Speech, of a &s;pirit of invective and unfair exaggeration. At the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that its impiety is &s;o mon&s;trous, that many good men were of opinion it ought not to be made fami|liar to the minds of Engli&s;hmen; for there are crimes with which even the imagina|tion &s;hould never come in contact.</P>
<P>But as an ancient nation intoxicated their &s;laves, and then expo&s;ed them before their children, in order to increa&s;e their horror of intemperance; &s;o it is hoped that this piece of impiety may be placed in &s;uch a light before the eyes of the Chri&s;tian reader, that, in proportion as his dete&s;tation is
<PB N="3" REF="18">rai&s;ed, his faith, in&s;tead of being &s;haken, will be only &s;o much the more &s;trength|ened.</P>
<P>This celebrated Speech, though delivered in an a&s;&s;embly of Politicians, is not on a que&s;tion of politics, but on one as &s;uperior as the &s;oul is to the body, and eternity to time. The object here, is not to dethrone kings, but HIM by whom kings reign. It does not here excite the cry of indignation that <HI>Louis</HI> reigns, but that <HI>the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is this the declaration of &s;ome ob|&s;cure and anonymous per&s;on, but an expo|&s;ition of the Creed of a public Leader. It is not a &s;entiment hinted in a journal, ha|zarded in a pamphlet, or thrown out at a di&s;puting club; but it is the implied faith of the rulers of a great nation.</P>
<P>Little notice would have been due to this famous Speech, if it had conveyed the &s;en|timents
<PB N="4" REF="19">of only <HI>one</HI> vain orator; but it &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that it was heard, re|ceived, <HI>applauded</HI> with two or three ex|ceptions only&mdash;a fact, which you, who have &s;carcely believed in the exi&s;tence of athei&s;m, will hardly credit, and which, for the honour of the eighteenth century, it is hoped that our po&s;terity, being &s;till more unacquainted with &s;uch corrupt opinions, will reject as totally incredible.</P>
<P>A love of liberty, generous in its prin|ciple, inclines &s;ome good men &s;till to fa|vour the proceedings of the National Con|vention of France. They do not yet per|ceive that the licentious wildne&s;s which has been excited in that country, is de&s;tructive of all true happine&s;s, and no more re&s;em|bles liberty, than the tumultuous joys of the drunkard re&s;emble the cheerfulne&s;s of a &s;ober and well-regulated mind.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e who do not know of what &s;trange incon&s;i&s;tencies man is made up;
<PB N="5" REF="20">who have not con&s;idered how &s;ome per|&s;ons, having at fir&s;t been ha&s;tily and heed|le&s;sly drawn in as approvers, by a &s;ort of natural progre&s;&s;ion, &s;oon become principals: &mdash;to tho&s;e who have never ob&s;erved by what a variety of &s;trange a&s;&s;ociations in the mind, opinions that &s;eem the mo&s;t irrecon|cilable meet at &s;ome un&s;u&s;pected turning, and come to be united in the &s;ame man;&mdash; to all &s;uch it may appear quite incredible, that well-meaning and even pious people &s;hould continue to applaud the principles of a &s;et of men who have publicly made known their intention of aboli&s;hing Chri&s;ti|anity, as far as the demolition of altars, prie&s;ts, temples, and in&s;titutions, <HI>can</HI> aboli&s;h it; and as to the religion it&s;elf, this al&s;o they may traduce, and for their own part reject, but we know, from the comfort|able promi&s;e of an authority &s;till &s;acred in this country at lea&s;t, that <HI>the gates of hell &s;hall not prevail again&s;t it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="21">Let me not be mi&s;under&s;tood by tho&s;e to whom the&s;e &s;light remarks are principally addre&s;&s;ed; that cla&s;s of well-intentioned people, who favour at lea&s;t, if they do not adopt, the prevailing &s;entiments of the new Republic. You are not here accu&s;ed of being the wilful abettors of infidelity. God forbid! <Q>we are per&s;uaded better things of you, and things which accompany &s;al|vation.</Q> But this <HI>ignis fatuus</HI> of li|berty and univer&s;al brotherhood, which the French are madly pur&s;uing, with the in|&s;ignia of freedom in one hand, and the bloody bayonet in the other, has bewitched your &s;en&s;es, and is in danger of mi&s;lead|ing your &s;teps. You are gazing at a me|teor rai&s;ed by the vapours of vanity, which the&s;e wild and infatuated wanderers are pur&s;uing to their de&s;truction; and though for a moment you mi&s;take it for a heaven|born light, which leads to the perfection of human freedom, you will, &s;hould you join in the mad pur&s;uit, &s;oon di&s;cover that
<PB N="7" REF="22">it will conduct you over dreary wilds and &s;inking bogs, only to plunge you in deep and inevitable ruin.</P>
<P>Much, very much is to be &s;aid in vindi|cation of your favouring in the fir&s;t in&s;tance their political projects. The cau&s;e they took in hand &s;eemed to be the great cau&s;e of human kind. Its very name in&s;ured its popularity. What Engli&s;h heart did not exult at the demolition of the Ba&s;tile? What lover of his &s;pecies did not triumph in the warm hope, that one of the fine&s;t countries in the world would &s;oon be one of the mo&s;t free? Popery and de&s;poti&s;m, though chain|ed by the gentle influence of Louis the &s;ixteenth, had actually &s;lain their thou|&s;ands. Little was it then imagined, that anarchy and athei&s;m, the mon&s;ters who were about to &s;ucceed them, would &s;oon &s;lay their ten thou&s;ands. If we cannot re|gret the defeat of the two former tyrants, what mu&s;t they be who can triumph in the mi&s;chiefs of the two latter? Who, I &s;ay, that had a head to rea&s;on, or a heart to
<PB N="8" REF="23">feel, did not glow with the hope, that from the ruins of tyranny, and the rubbi&s;h of popery, a beautiful and finely-framed edi|fice would in time have been con&s;tructed, and that ours would not have been the only country in which the patriots' fair idea of well-under&s;tood liberty, and of the mo&s;t pure and rea&s;onable, as well as the mo&s;t &s;ublime and exalted Chri&s;tianity, might be realized?</P>
<P>But, alas! it frequently happens that the wi&s;e and good are not the mo&s;t adventu|rous in attacking the mi&s;chiefs which they perceive and lament. With a timidity in &s;ome re&s;pects virtuous, they fear attempt|ing any thing which may po&s;&s;ibly aggra|vate the evils they deplore, or put to ha|zard the ble&s;&s;ings they already enjoy. They dread plucking up the wheat with the tares, and are rather apt, with a &s;pirit of hope|le&s;s re&s;ignation,</P>
<Q><L>To bear the ills they have,</L>
<L>Than fly to others that they know not of.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="9" REF="24">While &s;ober-minded and con&s;iderate men, therefore, &s;at mourning over this complicated ma&s;s of error, and waited till God, in his own good time, &s;hould open the blind eyes; the va&s;t &s;cheme of reform|ation was left to that &s;et of ra&s;h and pre|&s;umptuous adventurers, who are generally watching how they may convert public grievances to their own per&s;onal account. It was undertaken, not upon the broad ba&s;is of a wi&s;e and well-dige&s;ted &s;cheme, of which all the parts &s;hould contribute to the perfection of one con&s;i&s;tent whole: it was carried on, not by tho&s;e &s;teady mea|&s;ures, founded on rational deliberation, which are calculated to accompli&s;h &s;o im|portant an end; not with a temperance which indicated a &s;ober love of law, or a &s;acred regard for religion; but with the mo&s;t extravagant lu&s;t of power, and the mo&s;t inordinate vanity which perhaps ever in&s;tigated human mea&s;ures&mdash; a lu&s;t of power which threatens to extend its de|folating
<PB N="10" REF="25">&s;olating influence over the whole globe;&mdash;a vanity of the &s;ame de&s;tructive &s;pecies with that which &s;timulated the celebrated incendiary of Ephe&s;us, who being weary of his native ob&s;curity and in&s;ignificance, and preferring infamy to oblivion, could contrive no other road to fame and immor|tality, than that of &s;etting fire to the exqui|&s;ite Temple of Diana. He <HI>was</HI> remem|bered indeed, as he de&s;ired to be, but only to be execrated; while the &s;eventh wonder of the world lay pro&s;trate through his crime.</P>
<P>It is the &s;ame over-ruling vanity which operates in their politics, and in their re|ligion, which makes Ker&s;aint<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Speech, enumerating their intended projects.</NOTE> boa&s;t of carrying his de&s;tructive projects from the Tagus to the Brazils, and from Mexico to the &s;hores of the Ganges; which makes him menace to out&s;trip the enterprizes of the mo&s;t extravagant hero of romance,
<PB N="11" REF="26">and almo&s;t undertake with the marvel|lous celerity of the nimble-footed Puck,
<Q><L>To put a girdle round about the earth</L>
<L>In forty minutes.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>It is the &s;ame vanity, &s;till the ma&s;ter|pa&s;&s;ion in the bo&s;om of a Frenchman, which leads Dupont and Manuel to un|dertake in their orations to aboli&s;h the Sabbath, exterminate the Prie&s;thood, erect a Pantheon for the World, re&s;tore the Peri|patetic Philo&s;ophy, and in &s;hort revive every thing of ancient Greece, except the pure ta&s;te, the wi&s;dom, the love of virtue, the veneration of the laws, and that degree of reverence which even virtuous Pagans profe&s;&s;ed for the Deity.</P>
<P>It is &s;urely to be charged to the inade|quate and wretched hands into which the work of reformation fell, and not to the impo&s;&s;ibility of amending the civil and re|ligious
<PB N="12" REF="27">in&s;titutions of France, that all has &s;ucceeded &s;o ill. It cannot be denied per|haps, that a reforming &s;pirit was wanted in that country; their government was not more de&s;potic, than their church was &s;uper|&s;titious and corrupt.</P>
<P>But though this is readily granted, and though it may be unfair to blame tho&s;e who in the <HI>fir&s;t out&s;et</HI> of the French Revolution, rejoiced even on religious motives; yet it is a&s;toni&s;hing, how any pious per&s;on, even with all the blinding power of prejudice, can think without horror of the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> &s;tate of France. It is no le&s;s wonderful how any rational man could, even in the be|ginning of the Revolution, transfer that rea&s;oning, however ju&s;t it might be, when applied to France, to the ca&s;e of England. For what can be more unrea&s;onable, than to draw from different, and even oppo&s;ite premi&s;es, the &s;ame conclu&s;ion? Mu&s;t a re|volution
<PB N="13" REF="28">be equally nece&s;&s;ary in the ca&s;e of two &s;orts of Government, and two &s;orts of Religion, which are the very rever&s;e of each other?&mdash;oppo&s;ite in their genius, un|like in their fundamental principles, and widely different in each of their component parts.</P>
<P>That de&s;poti&s;m, prie&s;tcraft, intolerance, and &s;uper&s;tition, are terrible evils, no can|did Chri&s;tian it is pre&s;umed will deny; but, ble&s;&s;ed be God, though the&s;e mi&s;chiefs are not yet entirely bani&s;hed from the face of the earth, they have &s;carcely any exi&s;tence in this country.</P>
<P>To guard again&s;t a real danger, and to cure actual abu&s;es, of which the exi&s;tence has been fir&s;t plainly proved, by the ap|plication of a &s;uitable remedy, requires di|ligence as well as courage; ob&s;ervation as well as genius; patience and temperance as well as zeal and &s;pirit. It requires the union
<PB N="14" REF="29">of that clear head and &s;ound heart which con&s;titute the true patriot. But to conjure up fancied evils, or even greatly to aggravate real ones, and then to exhau&s;t our labour in combating them, is the characteri&s;tic of a di&s;tempered imagination and an ungo|verned &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Romantic cru&s;ades, the ordeal trial, drowning of witches, the torture, and the Inqui&s;ition, have been ju&s;tly repro|bated as the foule&s;t &s;tain of the re&s;pective periods in which, to the di&s;grace of human rea&s;on, they exi&s;ted; but would any man be rationally employed, who &s;hould now &s;tand up gravely to declaim again&s;t the&s;e as the predominating mi&s;chiefs of the pre&s;ent cen|tury? Even the whim&s;ical Knight of La Mancha him&s;elf, would not fight windmills that were pulled down; yet I will venture to &s;ay, that the above-named evils are at pre&s;ent little more chimerical than &s;ome of tho&s;e now &s;o bitterly complained of among
<PB N="15" REF="30">us. It is not as Dryden &s;aid, when one of his works was unmercifully abu&s;ed, that the piece has not faults enough in it, but the critics have not had the wit to fix upon the right ones.</P>
<P>It is allowed that, as a Nation, we have faults enough, but our political critics err in the objects of their cen&s;ure. They &s;ay little of tho&s;e real and pre&s;&s;ing evils re&s;ulting from our own corruption, which con&s;titute the actual mi&s;eries of life; while they gloomily &s;peculate upon a thou&s;and ima|ginary political grievances, and fancy that the reformation of our rulers and our le|gi&s;lators is all that is wanting to make us a happy people.</P>
<P>The principles of ju&s;t and equitable go|vernment were, perhaps, never more fully e&s;tabli&s;hed, nor public ju&s;tice more ex|actly admini&s;tered. Pure and undefiled religion was never laid more open to all,
<PB N="16" REF="31">than at this day. I wi&s;h I could &s;ay we were a religious people; but this at lea&s;t may be &s;afely a&s;&s;erted, that the great truths of religion were never better under&s;tood; that Chri&s;tianity was never more complete|ly &s;tripped from all its incumbrances and di&s;gui&s;es, or more thoroughly purged from human infu&s;ions, and whatever is deba&s;ing in human in&s;titutions.</P>
<P>In vain we look around us to di&s;cover the ravages of religious tyranny, or the triumphs of prie&s;tcraft or &s;uper&s;tition. Who at|tempts to impo&s;e any yoke upon our rea|&s;on? Who &s;eeks to put any blind on the eyes of the mo&s;t illiterate? Who fetters the judgment or en&s;laves the con&s;cience of the meane&s;t of our Prote&s;tant brethren? Nay, &s;uch is the power of pure Chri&s;tianity to enlighten the under&s;tanding, as well as to re|form the heart, and &s;uch are the advantages which the mo&s;t abject in this country po&s;&s;e&s;s for enjoying its privileges, that the poore&s;t
<PB N="17" REF="32">pea&s;ant among us, if he be as religious as multitudes of his &s;tation really are, has clearer ideas of God and his own &s;oul, purer notions of that true liberty wherewith Chri&s;t has made him free, than the mere di&s;puter of this world, though he po&s;&s;e&s;s every &s;plendid advantage which education, wi&s;dom, and genius can be&s;tow. I am not &s;peaking either of a perfect form of Government, or a perfect Church E&s;tabli&s;h|ment, becau&s;e I am &s;peaking of In&s;titutions which are human; and the very idea of their being human, involves al&s;o the idea of imperfection. But I am &s;peaking of the be&s;t con&s;tituted Government, and the be&s;t con&s;tituted National Church with which we are yet acquainted. Time, that &s;ilent in&s;tructor, and Experience, that great rec|tifier of the judgment, will more and more di&s;cover to us what is wanting to the per|fection of both. And if we may tru&s;t to the active genius of Chri&s;tian Liberty, and
<PB N="18" REF="33">to that liberal and candid &s;pirit which is the characteri&s;tic of the age we live in, there is little doubt but that a tem|perate and well-regulated zeal will, at a convenient &s;ea&s;on, correct what&s;oever &s;ound policy &s;hall &s;ugge&s;t as wi&s;e and expedient.</P>
<P>If there are errors in the Church, and it does not perhaps require the &s;harp-&s;ighted|ne&s;s of a keen oppo&s;er to di&s;cover that there are, there is at lea&s;t nothing like fierce in|tolerance, or &s;piritual u&s;urpation. A fiery zeal and an uncharitable bigotry might have furni&s;hied matter for a well-de&s;erved eccle&s;i|a&s;tical philippic in other times; but thanks to the temper of the pre&s;ent day, unle&s;s we conjure up a &s;pirit of religious chivalry, and &s;ally forth in que&s;t of imaginary evils, we &s;hall not apprehend any danger from per&s;e|cution or enthu&s;ia&s;m. If grievances there are, they do not appear to be tho&s;e which
<PB N="19" REF="34">re&s;ult from polemic pride and rigid bigotry, but are of a kind far different.</P>
<P>If the warm &s;un of pro&s;perity has un|happily produced its too common effect, in relaxing the vigour of religious ex|ertion; if, in too many in&s;tances, &s;ecu|rity has engendered &s;loth, and affluence produced di&s;&s;ipation; let us implore the Divine grace, that the pre&s;ent alarming cri|&s;is may rou&s;e the carele&s;s, and quicken the &s;upine; that our pa&s;tors may be convinced that the Church has le&s;s to fear from external violence, than from internal de|cay; nay, that even the violence of attack is often really beneficial, by exciting that activity which enables us to repel danger, &s;ince increa&s;e of diligence is the true&s;t ac|ce&s;&s;ion of &s;trength: that the love of power, with which their enemies perhaps unju&s;tly accu&s;e them, is not more fatal than the love of plea&s;ure: that no degree of orthodoxy, in opinion can atone for a too clo&s;e a&s;&s;imi|lation
<PB N="20" REF="35">with the manners of the world; that here&s;y without, is le&s;s to be dreaded than indifference from within: that the mo&s;t regular clerical education, the mo&s;t &s;crupu|lous attention to forms, and even the &s;tricte&s;t conformity to the e&s;tabli&s;hed opinions of the Church, will avail but little to the en|largement of Chri&s;t's kingdom, without a &s;trict &s;pirit of per&s;onal watchfulne&s;s, ha|bitual &s;elf-denial, and laborious exertion.</P>
<P>Though it is not here intended to animad|vert on any political complaint which is not in &s;ome &s;ort connected with religion; yet it is pre&s;umed it may not be thought quite foreign to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to remark, that among the reigning complaints again&s;t our civil admini&s;tration, the mo&s;t plau&s;ible &s;eems to be that excited by the &s;uppo&s;ed danger of an inva&s;ion on the Liberty of the Pre&s;s. Were this apprehen&s;ion well-found|ed, we &s;hould indeed be threatened by one of the mo&s;t grievous misfortunes that can
<PB N="21" REF="36">befal a free country. It is not only a mo&s;t noble privilege it&s;elf, but the guardian of all our other liberties; and, notwith&s;tand|ing the abu&s;e which has lately been made of this valuable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, yet every man of a &s;ound unprejudiced mind is well aware that true liberty of every kind is &s;carcely inferior in importance to any object for which human activity can con|tend. Nay, the very abu&s;e of a good, often makes us more &s;en&s;ible of its value. Fair and well-proportioned Freedom will ever retain all her native beauty to a judi|cious eye, nor will her genuine form be the le&s;s prized for our having lately con|templated the di&s;torted features and fal&s;e colouring of her caricature, as pre&s;ented to us by the daubing hand of Gallic patriots.</P>
<P>But highly as the Freedom of the Pre&s;s ought to be valued, would it really be &s;o very heavy a misfortune, if corrupt and inflaming publications, calculated to de&s;troy
<PB N="22" REF="37">that peace which every good man is anxious to pre&s;erve, &s;hould, ju&s;t at this alarming period, be &s;omewhat difficult to be ob|tained? Would it be &s;o very grievous a national calamity, if the crooked progeny of trea&s;on and bla&s;phemy &s;hould find it a little inconvenient to venture forth from their lurking-holes, and range abroad in open day? Is the cheapne&s;s of poi&s;on, or the facility with which it may be obtained, to be reckoned among the real advantages of medicinal repo&s;itories? And can the ea&s;ine&s;s of acce&s;s to &s;editious or athei&s;tical writings, be numbered among the &s;ub&s;tan|tial ble&s;&s;ings of any country?

It is tearing up the very foundation of human hope, and extirpating every true principle of human excellence. It is annihilating the very exi&s;tence of virtue, by annihilating its motives, its &s;anctions, its obligations, and its end.</P>
<P>That athei&s;m will be the favoured and the popular tenet in France &s;eems highly probable;
<PB N="27" REF="42">whil&s;t in that wild contempt of all religion, which has lately had the arro|gance to call it&s;elf toleration, it is not im|probable that Chri&s;tianity it&s;elf may be to|lerated in that country, as a &s;ect not per&s;e|cuted indeed, but derided. It is, however, far from clear, that this will be the ca&s;e, if the new doctrines &s;hould become generally prevalent; although the great apo&s;tles of infidelity, Voltaire and his di&s;ciples, have employed all the acutene&s;s of their wit to convince us that irreligion never per&s;e|cutes. To prove this, every art of fal&s;e citation, partial extract, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed evi|dence, and gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;entation has been put in practice. But if this un&s;up|ported a&s;&s;ertion were true, then Polycarp, Ignatius, Ju&s;tin, Cyprian, and Ba&s;il, did not &s;uffer for the faith once delivered to the Saints. Then the famous Chri&s;tian apo|logi&s;ts, mo&s;t of them learned converts from the pagan philo&s;ophy, idly employed their zeal to abate a clamour which did not exi&s;t, and

To this it may be an&s;wered, that modern infidels not only deny the ten pagan per&s;ecutions, but accu&s;e Chri&s;tianity of being the only per&s;ecuting religion; and affirm, that only tho&s;e who refu&s;e to embrace it, di&s;cover a &s;pirit of tole|ration</NOTE>.</P>

Analogy from hi&s;tory, a &s;tudy of pa&s;t events, and an inve&s;tigation of pre&s;ent principles and pa&s;&s;ions; judgment, memory, and deduc|tion, afford human &s;agacity but very &s;lender a&s;&s;i&s;tance in its endeavours to develope their future plans.

The arts of &s;ocial life may give a &s;weetne&s;s
<PB N="34" REF="49">to the manners and language, and induce, in &s;ome degree, a love of ju&s;tice, truth, and humanity; but attainments derived from &s;uch inferior cau&s;es are no more than the &s;emblance and the &s;hadow of the qualities derived from pure Chri&s;tianity. Varni&s;h is an extraneous ornament, but true poli&s;h is a proof of the &s;olidity of the body; it de|pends greatly on the nature of the &s;ub|&s;tance, is not &s;uperinduced by accidental cau&s;es, but in a good mea&s;ure proceeding from internal &s;oundne&s;s.</P>
<P>The poets of that country, who&s;e &s;tyle, &s;entiments, manners, and religion the French &s;o affectedly labour to imitate, have left keen and biting &s;atires on the Roman vices.

Far be it from me to wound, unnece&s;&s;arily, the feelings of people whom I &s;o &s;incerely e&s;teem; but it is much to be &s;u&s;pected, that certain opinions in politics have a tendency to lead to certain opinions in religion. Where &s;o much is at &s;take, they will do well to keep their con&s;ciences tender, in order to which they &s;hould try to keep their di&s;cernment acute. They will do well to ob&s;erve, that the &s;ame re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit of innovation is bu&s;ily operating un|der various, though &s;eemingly unconnected forms. To ob&s;erve, that the &s;ame impatience of re&s;traint, the &s;ame contempt of order, peace, and &s;ubordination, which makes
<PB N="37" REF="52">makes men bad citizens, makes them bad Chri&s;tians; and that to this &s;ecret, but al|mo&s;t infallible connexion between reli|gious and political &s;entiment, does France owe her pre&s;ent unparalleled anarchy and impiety.</P>
<P>There are doubtle&s;s in that unhappy country multitudes of virtuous and rea&s;on|able men, who rather &s;ilently acquie&s;ce in the authority of their pre&s;ent turbulent go|vernment, than embrace its principles or promote its projects from the &s;ober con|viction of their own judgment. The&s;e, together with tho&s;e con&s;cientious exiles whom this nation &s;o honourably protects, may yet live to rejoice in the re&s;toration of true liberty and &s;olid peace to their native country, when light and order &s;hall &s;pring from the pre&s;ent darkne&s;s and confu&s;ion, and the reign of chaos &s;hall be no more.</P>
<P>May I be permitted a &s;hort digre&s;&s;ion on the &s;ubject of the&s;e exiles? It &s;hall only be
<PB N="38" REF="53">to remark, that all the boa&s;ted conque&s;ts of our Edwards and our Henrys over the French nation, do not confer &s;uch &s;ub&s;tan|tial glory on our own country, as &s;he de|rives from having received, protected, and &s;upported, among multitudes of other &s;uf|ferers, at a time and under circum&s;tances &s;o peculiarly di&s;advantageous to her&s;elf, <HI>three thou&s;and prie&s;ts,</HI> of a nation habitually her enemy, and of a religion intolerant and ho&s;tile to her own. This is the &s;olid tri|umph of true Chri&s;tianity; and it is worth remarking, that the deeds which poets and hi&s;torians celebrate as rare and &s;plendid ac|tions, and &s;ublime in&s;tances of greatne&s;s of &s;oul, in the heroes of the Pagan world, are but the ordinary and habitual virtues which occur in the common cour&s;e of action among Chri&s;tians; quietly performed with|out effort or exertion, and with no view to renown; but re&s;ulting naturally and ne|ce&s;&s;arily from the religion they profe&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="54">So predominating is the power of an ex|ample we have once admired, and &s;et up as a &s;tandard of imitation, and &s;o fa&s;ci|nating has been the a&s;cendancy of the Con|vention over the minds of tho&s;e who&s;e ap|probation of French politics commenced in the earlier periods of the Revolution, that it extends to the mo&s;t trivial circum&s;tances. I cannot forbear to notice this in an in|&s;tance which, though incon&s;iderable in it|&s;elf, yet cea&s;es to be &s;o when we view it in the light of a &s;ymptom of the reigning di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>While the fanta&s;tic phra&s;eology of the new Republic is &s;uch, as to be almo&s;t as di&s;gu&s;ting to &s;ound ta&s;te, as their doctrines are to &s;ound morals, it is curious to ob&s;erve how deeply the addre&s;&s;es, which have been &s;ent to it from the Clubs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Collection of Addre&s;&s;es from England.</NOTE> in this country,
<PB N="40" REF="55">have been infected with it, as far at lea&s;t as phra&s;es and terms are objects of imitation. In other re&s;pects, it is but ju&s;tice to the French Convention to confe&s;s, that they are hitherto without rivals and without imita|tors; for who can a&s;pire to emulate that compound of anarchy and athei&s;m which in their debates is mixed up with the pedantry of &s;chool-boys, the jargon of a cabal, and the vulgarity and ill-breed|ing of a mob? One in&s;tance of the pre|vailing cant may &s;uffice, where an hundred might be adduced; and it is not the mo&s;t exceptionable.&mdash;To demoli&s;h every exi&s;t|ing law and e&s;tabli&s;hment; to de&s;troy the fortunes and ruin the principles of every country into which they are carrying their de&s;tructive arms and their frantic doc|trines; to untie or cut a&s;under every bond which holds &s;ociety together; to impo&s;e their own arbitrary &s;hackles where they &s;ucceed, and to demoli&s;h every thing where they fail.&mdash;This de&s;olating &s;y&s;tem,

by a mo&s;t unaccountable perver&s;ion of lan|guage, they are plea&s;ed to call by the en|dearing name of <HI>fraternization;</HI> and fra|ternization is one of the favourite terms which their admirers have adopted. Lit|tle would a &s;imple &s;tranger, uninitiated in this new and &s;urpri&s;ing dialect, imagine that the peaceful terms of fellow-citizen and of brother, the winning offer of freedom and happine&s;s, and the warm embrace of fraternity, were only watch-words by which they, in effect,</P>

<L>And let &s;lip the dogs of war.</L></Q>
<P>In numberle&s;s other in&s;tances, the fa&s;hion|able language of France at this day would be as unintelligible to the correct writers of the age of Louis the XIVth, as their fa&s;hion|able notions of liberty would be irreconcile|able with tho&s;e of the true Revolution Pa|triots
<PB N="42" REF="57">of his great contemporary and vic|torious rival, William the Third.</P>
<P>Such is indeed their puerile rage for novelty in the invention of new words, and the perver&s;ion of their ta&s;te in the u&s;e of old ones, that the celebrated Vo&s;|&s;ius, whom Chri&s;tine of Sweden oddly complimented by &s;aying, that he was &s;o learned as not only to know whence all words came, but whither they were going, would, <HI>were be admitted to the honours of a &s;itting</HI> be obliged to confe&s;s, that he was equally puzzled to tell the one, or to foretel the other.</P>
<P>If it &s;hall plea&s;e the Almighty in his anger to let loo&s;e this infatuated people, as a &s;courge for the iniquities of the human race; if they are delegated by infinite ju&s;tice to act, as &s;torm and tempe&s;t fulfilling his
<PB N="43" REF="58">word; if they are commi&s;&s;ioned to per|form the errand of the de&s;troying lightning or the avenging thunder-bolt, let us try at lea&s;t to extract per&s;onal benefit from national calamity; let every one of us, high and low, rich and poor, enter upon this &s;erious and humbling inquiry, how much his own individual offences have contributed to that awful aggregate of public guilt, which has required &s;uch a vi&s;itation. Let us carefully examine in what proportion we have &s;e|parately added to that common &s;tock of abounding iniquity, the de&s;cription of which formed the character of an ancient nation, and is &s;o peculiarly applicable to our own&mdash;<HI>Pride, fulne&s;s of bread, and abundance of idlene&s;s.</HI> Let every one of us humbly in|quire, in the &s;elf-&s;u&s;pecting language of the di&s;ciples to their Divine Ma&s;ter&mdash;<HI>Lord, is it I?</HI> Let us learn to fear the fleets and
<PB N="44" REF="59">
armies of the enemy, much le&s;s than tho&s;e iniquities at home which this alarming di&s;pen&s;ation may be intended to cha&s;tize.</P>
<P>The war which the French have declared again&s;t us, is of a kind altogether unexam|pled in every re&s;pect; in&s;omuch that human wi&s;dom is baffled when it would pretend to conjecture what may be the event. But this at lea&s;t we may &s;afely &s;ay, that it is not &s;o much the force of French bayonets, as the contamination of French principles, that ought to excite our apprehen&s;ions. We tru&s;t, that through the ble&s;&s;ing of GOD we &s;hall be defended from their open ho&s;tilities, by the temperate wi&s;dom of our Rulers, and the bravery of our fleets and armies; but the dome&s;tic danger ari&s;ing from licentious and irreligious principles among our&s;elves, can only be guarded again&s;t by the per&s;onal care and vigilance of every one of us who
<PB N="45" REF="60">who values religion and the good order of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>GOD grant that tho&s;e who go forth to fight our battles, in&s;tead of being intimi|dated by the number of their enemies, may hear in mind, that "there is no re&s;traint with GOD to &s;ave by many or by few." And let the meane&s;t of us who remains at home remember al&s;o, that even he may contri|bute to the internal &s;afety of his country, by the integrity of his private life, and to the &s;ucce&s;s of her defenders, by following them with his fervent prayers. And in what war can the &s;incere Chri&s;tian ever have &s;tronger inducements to pray for the &s;ucce&s;s of his country, than in this? Without en|tering far into any political principles, the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of which would be in a great mea&s;ure foreign to the de&s;ign of this little tract, it may be remarked, that the un|chri&s;tian principle of revenge is not our motive to this war; conque&s;t is not our object;
<PB N="46" REF="61">nor have we had recour&s;e to ho&s;|tility, in order to effect a change in the in|ternal government of France<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Report of Mr. Pitt's Speech in the Hou&s;e of Commons on Feb. 12, 1793, publi&s;hed by Woodfall.</NOTE>. The pre|&s;ent war is undoubtedly undertaken entirely on defen&s;ive principles. It is in defence of our King, our Con&s;titution, our Religion, our Laws, and con&s;equently our <HI>Liberty,</HI> in the &s;ound and rational &s;en&s;e of that term. It is to defend our&s;elves from the &s;avage violence of a cru&s;ade, made again&s;t all Religion, as well as all Government. If ever therefore a war was undertaken on the ground of &s;elf-defence and nece&s;&s;ity&mdash;if ever men might be literally &s;aid to fight <HI>pro</HI> ARIS <HI>et focis,</HI> this &s;eems to be the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The ambition of conquerors has been the &s;ource of great and exten&s;ive evils: reli|gious fanatici&s;m, of &s;till greater. But little as I am di&s;po&s;ed to become the apologi&s;t of either
<PB N="47" REF="62">the one principle or the other, there is no extravagance in a&s;&s;erting, that they have &s;eemed incapable of producing, even in ages, that extent of mi&s;chief, that com|prehen&s;ive de&s;olation, which <HI>philo&s;ophy, fal&s;ely &s;o called,</HI> has produced in three years.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tians! it is not a &s;mall thing&mdash;<HI>it is your life.</HI> The pe&s;tilence of irreligion which you dete&s;t, will in&s;inuate it&s;elf im|perceptibly with tho&s;e manners, phra&s;es, and principles which you admire and adopt. It is the humble wi&s;dom of a Chri&s;tian, to &s;hrink from the mo&s;t di&s;tant approaches to &s;in, to ab&s;tain from the very appearance of evil. If we would fly from the deadly contagion of Athei&s;m, let us fly from tho&s;e &s;eemingly remote, but not very indirect paths which lead to it. Let France chu&s;e this day whom &s;he will &s;erve; <HI>but, as for us and our hou&s;es, we will &s;erve the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>And, O gracious and long &s;uffering God! before that awful period arrives, which
<PB N="48" REF="63" MS="y">&s;hall exhibit the dreadful effects of &s;uch an education as the French nation are in&s;tituting; before a race of men can be trained up, not only without the knowledge of THEE, but in the contempt of THY mo&s;t holy law, do THOU, in great mercy, change the heart of this people as the heart of one man. Give them not finally over to their own corrupt imaginations, to their own heart's lu&s;ts. But after having made them a fearful example to all the nations of the earth, what a people <HI>can</HI> do, who have ca&s;t off the fear of THEE, do THOU graciou&s;ly bring them back to a &s;en&s;e of that law which they have violated, and to a participation of that mercy which they have abu&s;ed; &s;o that they may happily find, while the di&s;covery can be attended with con&s;olation, that <HI>doubtle&s;s there is a re|ward for the righteous; verily, there is a GOD who judgeth the earth.</HI></P>
