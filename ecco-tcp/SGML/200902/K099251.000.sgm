<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>SO my dear Charles, you are at length, after a pa&s;&s;age of five weeks, three days, and odd hours, arrived in our little &s;un-burnt i&s;land?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing, I'll a&s;&s;ure you Whitmore, would have brought me on this &s;ide the Atlantic, but my unconquerable pa&s;&s;ion for the adorable Loui&s;a Win&s;tone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="5">
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mi&s;s Win&s;tone, Sir, has been long the belle of this i&s;land, and has been the occa&s;ion, I al|ready hear, of much envy among the ladies, and as much pa&s;&s;ion among the gentlemen. But could you obtain nothing more de&s;irable at home, that you mu&s;t needs neglect an Albion flower for a poor drooping Antigua blo&s;&s;om?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't di&s;honour my Loui&s;a by any odious compari&s;on. Before &s;he left England &s;he car|ried the ro&s;e in her cheeks, the rainbow in her forehead, lightning in her eyes, with grace, innocence and elegance in her whole frame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hu&s;h, hu&s;h, man; don't be over extrava|gant; I grant Mi&s;s Win&s;tone might have po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed all you &s;ay upon her fir&s;t arrival here, but you do not know how &s;oon every thing fades in this climate. For my own part, I cannot &s;ay much for her complexion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her complexion Sir, I grant you, may be a little tanned, but I am &s;ure her features ever mu&s;t remain beautiful. My dear Whitmore I am impatient to &s;ee her; conduct me therefore to her father's wherever it is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="6">
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is ju&s;t by; but I am &s;o engaged with plan|tation bu&s;ine&s;s that I am afraid I &s;hall hardly be able to &s;pare a minute from the toils of the crop. However Sir, not to baulk &s;o pa&s;&s;ionate a lover, I'll mount you on the be&s;t &s;teed I have, and follow you like a true 'Squire on the be&s;t mule or jack a&s;s on the whole e&s;tate. But pray, Sir, would you not chu&s;e a draught of punch after your hot ride from town? it is the cu&s;tom here always to have the bowl in readine&s;s. Here, Ce&s;ar, Ce&s;ar.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CESAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Coming, Ma&s;&s;ah.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But pray, Sir, what impre&s;&s;ion do you re|ceive from the &s;cenes about you in this part of the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly I am at a lo&s;s to explain them; but they are upon the whole very &s;trange. As I journeyed through the different e&s;tates I heard as I thought nothing but the cracking and bouncing of fire works; but was very &s;oon convinced that the noi&s;e proceeded from the &s;macks of the whips, and the correction which is daily and hourly inflicted on the &s;laves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="7">
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, but we are obliged to put the whip to a &s;lave as we do a match to powder, in order to get it to act at all. Ce&s;ar, I &s;ay Ce&s;ar!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CESAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Coming, Ma&s;&s;ah! coming.
<STAGE>yawning.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>How &s;low the fellow is.
<STAGE>yawning.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every thing, Sir, is &s;low in this climate, the hor&s;es are &s;low, the cattle &s;low, mules &s;low, in &s;hort a general &s;loth hangs upon every thing. Ce&s;ar! Ce&s;ar! Ce&s;ar!
<STAGE>bawling ha&s;tily.</STAGE></P>
<STAGE>[Ce&s;ar yawns, rubs his eyes, and produces the bowl of punch.]</STAGE>
<P>What, Sir, were you a&s;leep? &s;tupor hangs as naturally upon the dog, as mi&s;t upon the mountains. My &s;ervice to you, Sir.
<STAGE>Drinks, and hands it to Lovemore.</STAGE></P>

<P>Plea&s;ant liquor in troth.
<STAGE>Drinks again.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="8">
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye don't drink too much of it though; for it may play the devil with you till you are better u&s;ed to the climate. Here, Mr. Ce&s;ar, take it away, and &s;addle the young Engli&s;h hor&s;e for this gentleman, and my manager's mule for me. Do you hear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CESAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Ma&s;&s;ah, me bring um up directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>If po&s;&s;ible do &s;o, but I am afraid you will re|quire another nap fir&s;t.
<STAGE>Exit Ce&s;ar.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould conceive it, Sir, a very laborious and painful employment to have the in&s;pection of a gang of &s;laves; have there been no ef|forts made to rai&s;e them above their brutal &s;tate, and to in&s;pire them with the &s;entiments of man?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, there was one man mad enough to make the attempt; but it was very &s;peedily found that as the &s;laves of his own e&s;tate im|proved in intellectual di&s;cernment, their corpo|real faculties relaxed, &s;o that the other gentle|men of the i&s;land by woeful experience very &s;oon dropped their liberal &s;entiments, and hung the dead weight of ignorance again about them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="9">
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ignorance undoubtedly is the true cau&s;e of &s;lavery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a truth, Sir, which we find verified every day; but pray, as you are &s;o pa&s;&s;ionate an admirer of Mi&s;s Win&s;tone, why did you not pre|vent her voyage to this part of the world?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I was then Sir, but a minor, and though Mi&s;s Win&s;tone favored my addre&s;&s;es, her father thought Jack Rattoon a better match for her, &s;o brought her over to marry him again&s;t her con&s;ent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, Sir, I recollect the whole affair; &s;he became on her arrival the adoration of the men in general, and very &s;oon grew out of humour with Jack, who&s;e face &s;he compared to a large four-&s;op; and who&s;e head &s;he declared was as &s;oft as a rotten quaver.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir, what are the di&s;tingui&s;hing good qualities of the ladies of this part of the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fidelity to their hu&s;bands, and tenderne&s;s to their children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>The inhabitants too are in general remarked
<PB N="9" REF="10">
for their ho&s;pitality to &s;trangers, as well as their candour and openne&s;s to each other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are &s;o, Sir, but the&s;e take their ri&s;e from the &s;ocial principle of man's nature, and which the want of &s;ociety creates. But here, I &s;ee Ce&s;ar has already prepared and &s;addled our cattle, therefore like a true Knight-Errant equip your&s;elf at all points, to meet your beauteous Dulcinia?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I am already; what more would you have?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will play this romantic youth a trick
<STAGE>a&s;ide. [aloud]</STAGE>
Why, Sir, though it may &s;urprize you, it is a cu&s;tom here, whenever any gentleman pays his fir&s;t vi&s;it to the lady he loves, to go armed and defended with all the weapons and implements of chivalry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly you je&s;t?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No in faith it is an old cu&s;tom, derived from the Spaniards, to whom you know the&s;e i&s;lands fir&s;t belonged.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impo&s;&s;ible!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="11">
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay but it is actually &s;o, and unle&s;s you permit me to arm you like a Knight-Errant, you will not &s;ee Mi&s;s Win&s;tone to-day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why my dear Mr. Whitmore you'll make a fool of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>A fool of you indeed; I'll put Minerva's own helmet on your head, and you &s;hall then &s;ee if you don't look as wi&s;e as a judge. Here, Ce&s;ar, fetch my old helmet, with the &s;hield and &s;word.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CESAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Ma&s;&s;ah.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>a&s;ide</STAGE>
<P>Certainly this man does not mean to expo&s;e me; what he &s;ays is very true; this i&s;land be|longed to Spain, and it is probable that a tincture of chivalry might have been derived from that &s;ource; be&s;ides, he is a We&s;t Indian, and tells the truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fir&s;t, Sir, let me gird on the &s;word; there,
<PB N="11" REF="12">
there it is; now put the &s;hield thus; and now la&s;t of all, Ce&s;ar fetch me the &s;pear.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, Mr. Whitmore, if I had known this was nece&s;&s;ary, I would have brought a compleat &s;uit of armour with me from Eng|land.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>That would not have done &s;o well perhaps; now Sir look at your&s;elf in the fir&s;t gla&s;s you come to, and &s;ee if you are not as warlike as Jack the Giant-killer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am obliged to you though, for making me &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have nothing to do Sir, but to pu&s;h your &s;pear again&s;t the fir&s;t rival you meet on the road.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rivals Sir! I hope to God I &s;hall not meet any.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will certainly meet a great many. Only con&s;ider the beauty and accompli&s;hments of the lady. She is always &s;urrounded by rivals Sir.
<PB N="12" REF="13">
Pray by what name do you chu&s;e to be an|nounced to her?</P>

<P>Aye any thing. Let us be off as fa&s;t as we can.</P>

<P>But harkee Mr. Knight, can you ride well? for if you cannot the hor&s;e will certainly throw you, as you mu&s;t expect he'll &s;tart at the &s;ight of a man in armour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where then is the u&s;e of armour, if it expo&s;es a man to new dangers; and as for my riding Sir, I am by no means &s;ecure in my &s;addle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then there will be an end to your knight hood if you once come to the ground: but come Sir, our cattle are braying, and I long for &s;ome new atchievement.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you &s;ee the &s;en&s;ation of pain, ari&s;ing from hunger, is produced by the action of the two coats of the &s;tomach acting upon each other; now the bandage confining the &s;tomach, and preventing this action, of cour&s;e takes away the pain. This therefore is one argument among many others to prove that dige&s;tion is performed by the action of the ma&s;tication of the &s;tomach, and not by putre|faction as &s;ome phy&s;icians erroneou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
