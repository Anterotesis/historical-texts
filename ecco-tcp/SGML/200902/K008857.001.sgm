<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>A Work which is in the world, under the title of the PUPIL OF PLEASURE, exemplified that part of a <HI>late celebrated &s;y&s;tem,</HI> which led im|mediately to voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, hypo|cri&s;y, and &s;eduction. It was, there|fore, a faint mark for literary ridi|cule. The peculiar &s;ucce&s;s of my
<PB N="ii" REF="5">undertaking, and the general e&s;teem it &s;till maintains, (notwith&s;tanding the wilful, or the ignorant, perver|&s;ions of a few individuals, who af|fected to have their &s;cruples concern|ing the character of <HI>Sedley)</HI> con|vince me, that I did not write in vain.</P>
<P>But, methinks, &s;omething very e&s;&s;ential yet remains to be done. There is a much <HI>better,</HI> as well as a much more <HI>brilliant, &s;y&s;tem</HI> &s;till to be illu&s;trated; the &s;y&s;tem of inte|grity and TRUTH.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="6">
This is attempted in the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> performance, where the reader will &s;ee, in contra&s;t to the <HI>Pupil of Plea|&s;ure,</HI> a character of a very different colouring figure before him. One, who, though even more accompli&s;hed than SEDLEY, with all his fire, &s;pirit and opportunity, as well as every per|&s;onal advantage, employs each in the cau&s;e, not of ruin, but <HI>&s;ince|rity.</HI></P>
<P>It has been endeavoured al&s;o, that the &s;cenes, in which this new per|&s;onage is engaged, &s;hould be &s;o di&s;|po&s;ed, as to give full &s;cope for all that is ju&s;t, affecting and ennobled,
<PB N="iv" REF="7">without departing from human na|ture. The Hero of <HI>this</HI> production, like that of the <HI>other,</HI> hath many &s;truggles, and many anxieties; for virtue (with re&s;pect to <HI>ordinary</HI> &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es and rewards) is not always for|tunate: but between the two heroes there is, throughout their adventures, this di&s;tingui&s;hing difference; the one hath the pangs of <HI>remor&s;e</HI> &s;uperadded to tho&s;e of &s;hame and de&s;pair; and the &s;ufferings of the other, like the agonies of a Me&s;&s;iah, are always for the truth, and for the happine&s;s of others. All that the be&s;t men in the world can &s;ay to them&s;elves
<PB N="v" REF="8">is comprized in this couplet of the poet.</P>
<Q><L>'Tis not in mortals to <HI>command</HI> &s;ucce&s;s,</L>
<L>But we'll do <HI>more,</HI> Sempronius, we'll <HI>de&s;erve</HI> it.</L></Q>
<P>There have been tho&s;e (whether in the &s;pirit of critici&s;m, or from prin|ciple, I cannot tell) who have warned the young and &s;ober again&s;t the <HI>warmth of character</HI> in the <HI>Pupil of Plea&s;ure:</HI> &s;urely, a little thinking might reconcile to <HI>them,</HI> (as to the re&s;t of the world) the propriety of painting vice in &s;trong colours, in order to bring it into contempt. That very SEDLEY, who &s;ets out, with all the graces of <HI>Che&s;terfield</HI> in
<PB N="iv" REF="9">his train, &s;oon lo&s;es his credit with the reader; he fades, towards the con|clu&s;ion, more and more in every page; and at la&s;t, he becomes a de&s;perate, dete&s;ted man, on who&s;e grave even Pity her&s;elf can &s;carce be prevailed on to &s;hed a tear.</P>
<P>If, however, this objection, in the brea&s;t of any one, &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts again&s;t me, it would be a piece of ju&s;tice not unworthy the <HI>true</HI> critic, if he would take upon him to recom|mend the character of <HI>Captain Carli&s;le</HI> in this work, as officiou&s;ly as he has di&s;commended that of Mr. SEDLEY,
<PB N="vii" REF="10">in the other. In real fact, SEDLEY is the <HI>&s;hade</HI> which will &s;et CARLISLE in the proper <HI>light;</HI> and, although the <HI>&s;tories</HI> through which I have conveyed the moral, are utterly dif|ferent, yet tho&s;e, who are candid enough to conceive a book of this kind may be made <HI>&s;y&s;tematic,</HI> and who may read the two performances <HI>together,</HI> will, I flatter my&s;elf, per|ceive a connexion (with regard to &s;y&s;tem) not wholly inappo&s;ite.</P>
<P>In fine, <HI>Sedley</HI> is a mon&s;ter, and <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> is a man. Let them be ac|curately compared, and read only
<PB N="viii" REF="11">with this view, whenever they are in the hands of the young. As SEDLEY is the object of e&s;cape and abhorrence; CARLISLE is that of intimacy and imitation. He is much embarra&s;&s;ed, but he has ho|nour to bear him up: he is purpo&s;ely plunged in difficulty, that his <HI>truth</HI> might be the more tried; and that, <HI>being</HI> tried, it might, like fine gold from the fire, come forth the purer. He is <HI>Sedley</HI>'s oppo&s;ite in every parti|cular, except the attractions of form (which were given to SEDLEY al&s;o only to render <HI>Che&s;terfieldi&s;m</HI> more exact). CARLISLE protects the inno|cence
<PB N="ix" REF="12">that he might have de&s;troyed; he &s;pares the cha&s;tity that he might have violated; he endeavours to pre|&s;erve the wife, whom he might have ruined: he has all the policy of prudence, without deviating from <HI>truth:</HI> he is graced with every poli&s;h|ing ornament of character: in&s;tead of <HI>corrupting,</HI> he <HI>enriches</HI> &s;ociety.</P>
<P>That the hero of the pre&s;ent work might have every <HI>ultimate</HI> ad|vantage, &s;o as to bring the <HI>moral</HI> which his adventures convey, more forcibly home to the bu&s;ine&s;s and bo&s;om of the reader, he appears, at
<PB N="x" REF="13">different times, in all the amiable <HI>lights</HI> of which his picture is &s;u&s;cep|tible. Among&s;t the&s;e, the honour of his friend&s;hips, the tenderne&s;&s;es of his love, the delicacy of his &s;uffer|ings, his di&s;cretion under embarra&s;&s;|ments, and his courage in exigencies, will not e&s;cape the attentive reader. It &s;hould be noted, al&s;o, that the contra&s;t of the pre&s;ent, with the former performance, receives &s;till greater force, by the introduction of other &s;ketches which will be found here; particularly the &s;hort &s;cenes that belong to Mr. <HI>Henry Hew&s;on,</HI> and his brother. The&s;e
<PB N="xi" REF="14">characters are interwoven, not &s;o much to enliven, and relieve the deepne&s;s of the pathetic in the other parts, as to give greater elucidation to the <HI>&s;y&s;tem.</HI> With the like view, the characters of the fighting <HI>Med|way,</HI> and the fearful, frolick&s;ome Sir <HI>Andrew Flight,</HI> have been ad|mitted, as have tho&s;e of Mr. <HI>La&s;|celles,</HI> the <HI>Marchione&s;s of N</HI>***, and <HI>Lucia De Grey.</HI> It is hoped, the&s;e all promote the moral as much as they contribute to the intere&s;ts of the fable: for example, <HI>Sedley,</HI> the Pupil of Plea&s;ure, was uniformly vicious, deceitful, and reprobate,
<PB N="xii" REF="15">and therefore <HI>died.</HI> Captain <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> the Tutor of Truth, is invariably ju&s;t, ingenuous, and good, and therefore <HI>lives. Sedley</HI> often felt the &s;troke of ill &s;ucce&s;s, but con&s;oled him&s;elf in the wor&s;t of times with the hope of accompli&s;hing his wicked wi&s;hes at la&s;t. <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> is &s;en&s;ible of di&s;appoint|ment too, but is kept from paroxi&s;ms of de&s;pair by a &s;ilent appeal to his con|&s;cience. <HI>La&s;celles</HI> is at once raki&s;h, fal&s;e, di&s;&s;olute, and therefore meets with puni&s;hment. The <HI>Marchione&s;s of N</HI>***, though pitiable, is al&s;o an object of terror to be held up to the female world, &s;ince the &s;ame imprudence will naturally lead to the
<PB N="xiii" REF="16">&s;ame mi-fortunes. The Earl and Counte&s;s of <HI>Ble&s;&s;ingbourne</HI> are brought into this work, to &s;hew, that, <HI>true politene&s;s</HI> and <HI>the Graces,</HI> are charms independent of mere rank, titles, or e&s;tate: the family of the <HI>Hew&s;ons</HI> are here, to prove, that, <HI>true politene&s;s</HI> and the <HI>Graces</HI> are not to be bought, as mere marketable commodities, whenever a man happens to have money to &s;pare; and to prove like|wi&s;e, that neither ru&s;tic manners on the one hand, nor booki&s;h pedan|try on the other, will enable men to leave the farm-hou&s;e and the cloy&s;ter to figure, more re&s;pectably, in a &s;tate
<PB N="xiv" REF="17">of refinement. In full oppo&s;ition to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll</HI> the&s;e, therefore, the Hero of this work is produced. He is as truly polite as he is truly generous, and, agreeable to the title given to him at &s;etting out&mdash;He is A TUTOR OF TRUTH.</P>

<P>ACCORDING to cu&s;tom, I am to &s;end you joy upon the <HI>ca&s;&s;ion</HI> of grandfather's <HI>&s;tealing</HI> off. As you and I were <HI>in at the death,</HI> and got &s;uch a &s;winging <HI>edition</HI> to our fortune, it would

<HEAD>LETTER VII. Mrs. HENRIETTA HEWSON to Mi&s;s DE GREY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE plea&s;ure I expected in your company this &s;ea&s;on at Helter Skelter Hall mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity, be po&s;tponed till the &s;ummer following. Every thing is at &s;ixes and &s;evens; be|&s;ides which, the large addition to my fortune makes it very improper I &s;hould &s;ee my friends in the <HI>hugger-mugger</HI> man|ner I did, while I was as poor as my neighbours. I have po&s;itively found out, my dear DE GREY, that there is not a &s;ingle room in this up and down old man&s;ion fit to &s;it in, much le&s;s to receive
<PB N="21" REF="38">the mo&s;t delicate of her &s;ex. But &s;ince I am deprived of the plea&s;ure I expected in having you with me, as u&s;ual, I pro|po&s;e to commence a corre&s;pondence with you, that I may tell you from time to time how we go on in tho&s;e alterations that I am re&s;olved immediately to make. I de&s;ign to fit up the &s;weete&s;t retreat in the univer&s;e, your father's not excepted &mdash;I &s;ay <HI>retreat,</HI> becau&s;e I &s;hall occa&s;ion|ally retreat to it: for, I certainly &s;hall not pa&s;s my winters for the future out of Pall-Mall (<HI>that</HI> is, I think I have heard you &s;ay, the be&s;t quarter of the town) be&s;ides its having the double re|commendation of being the winter re&s;i|dence of Mi&s;s DE GREY.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as I writ your name, I happened to look at the chimney-piece, and I ab|&s;olutely thought it had undergone a per|fect change within this week; as, in|deed,
<PB N="22" REF="39">in my opinion, hath every thing about the hou&s;e. I cannot look at an object in the hall or the great garden that does not di&s;gu&s;t me. Heaven have mercy on me! how they wanted ta&s;te in building formerly! Such huge, horrid, outward doors, &s;tudded with &s;uch mon|&s;trous nobs of non; &s;uch dreadful arches to every entrance, like the porches of ugly &s;tone-work before a church; &s;uch corners, lanes, entries, and alleys, run|ning like laby rinths through every room: the fire-places &s;o large, the windows &s;o little, the gla&s;s of them &s;o diminutive, the wain&s;cotings &s;o figured, the beams &s;o bulky, and the pa&s;&s;ages &s;o dark and dirty, that they &s;eem built rather to be the dens for bea&s;ts of prey, than for &s;uch harm|le&s;s little creatures as men and women. Then the gardens are as hideous as the habitations: only to think, LUCIA, of a <HI>con-&s;umed</HI> great mote, divided only by
<PB N="23" REF="40">a na&s;ty drawbridge, running quite round the man&s;ion, mo&s;t gloriou&s;ly cropped with duck-weed, and inviting all the fowls of the air to flap their wings and feed about us, to the great annoyance of &s;leep and every other comfort. Add to this, the gardens <HI>them&s;elves</HI>&mdash;I am now lifting up my head from the vulgar old table on which I am writing, and I am taking&mdash;I declare to you, almo&s;t with tears in my eyes&mdash;a view of our precious platform. I behold in pro|&s;pect about three acres of ground, as completely murdered in the di&s;po&s;ition, as a modern gardener could wi&s;h: eight-and-twenty yew-trees, inter&s;per&s;ed with an equal number of boxes and hollies, ri&s;e before me, to who&s;e flouri&s;hing &s;hades I am to attribute half the vermin that &s;warm like a pe&s;tilence about us. Let not the abominable walls that &s;ur|round our dwelling and its environs, be
<PB N="24" REF="41">forgotten; high above all height; brown above every thing embrowned.&mdash;But I have not patience to proceed. And &s;hall I invite the lovely LUCIA to this Gothic &s;cene? No, LUCIA, no; now that kind Fortune hath put it into my power, I will level with the du&s;t this ruinous pile of building, and rai&s;e up in its &s;tead &s;o different a &s;tructure, that the very ground &s;hall thank me for <HI>dre&s;&s;ing it out</HI> &s;o charmingly. The moment I have compleated my de&s;ign you &s;hall come and confe&s;s I have a reli&s;h for improve|ments. I have, this moment, the exact image of my intentions. Where there are now mountains, will I make vallies; where there are at pre&s;ent crops of nettles, or vulgar flowers that are to me wor&s;e than nettles, will I &s;et rows of lillies and beds of ro&s;es; ro&s;es I mean of <HI>mo&s;s,</HI> that &s;carce bur&s;t forth from the bearded bud, elegant, &s;mall, odorife|rous,
<PB N="25" REF="42">and not &s;uch flaring, fla&s;hing, old-fa&s;hioned things, as figure away in our garden, that look as if the &s;eeds were &s;own and the trees planted imme|diately after the fall; ju&s;t when all the beautiful in Nature fir&s;t felt the cur&s;e upon it. As to the yew-trees, I will not leave one of them alive, no not even that which is cut into the form of a &s;ugar-loaf; and, &s;o inveterate is my vengeance in regard to the&s;e, that I will, yea even after they are fell'd&mdash; make the infected wretches perform quarantine at a mile's di&s;tance, in open air, before I will allow them the honour of being <HI>burned</HI> in my pre&s;ence: as to my old friend the <HI>mote,</HI> with whom I have exchanged watry looks, ever &s;ince I &s;aw him, I will cau&s;e all his channels to be dried up, and <HI>terra firma,</HI> as brother GAB calls it, to flouri&s;h about him. The drawbridge will I al&s;o remove; and, to
<PB N="26" REF="43">&s;hew my di&s;like and ridicule of &s;uch an antique, I will &s;ub&s;titute, by way of mockery and the mode, an ha! ha! in his &s;tead. Neither &s;hall any part of our <HI>hou&s;e furniture</HI> fare better, for there &s;hall be a general <HI>clearance.</HI> Stags heads &s;hall give place to Hogarth's prints: family pictures, notwith&s;tanding the large ruffs on my grandmother's neck, the whi&s;kers on my great uncle's upper lip, and the profu&s;ion of chitterlin on my god-papa's bo&s;om, mu&s;t all yield to politer decorations.&mdash;In &s;hort, I will create a paradi&s;e about me, and that without delay. In the mean time, I will <HI>commence</HI> the woman of fa&s;hion, by giving orders never to be &s;een by any body but trade&s;men, till I am all <HI>to|rights</HI>&mdash;not even by LUCIA DE GREY. How I &s;hall bring Mr. HEWSON over to this genteel way of thinking, I don't know; particularly as he is not, you
<PB N="27" REF="44">know, the be&s;t bred man in the world. However, done it mu&s;t be&mdash;that's flat; for I cannot breathe any longer in &s;uch a place! Oh Heavens, how have I breath'd &s;o long! It is equally an affront to my per&s;on, my under&s;tanding, and my fortune! If any little ornaments &s;trike <HI>you,</HI> that may a&s;&s;i&s;t my &s;cheme of embelli&s;hing, pray think of them in your next. I de&s;ign to call one of my new rooms <HI>Lucia</HI>'s <HI>Saloon.</HI> Pray, there|fore, let LUCIA's fancy a&s;&s;i&s;t me in fitting it up.</P>

<P>YES, brother, yes: thou be|loved branch of the &s;ame family; thou dear &s;cyon of the &s;ame &s;tock; I again confe&s;s, I am not, in any degree, the man I was. This &s;udden <HI>gale of gay Pro&s;perity,</HI> who&s;e beams are &s;o burni&s;hed to the eyes of fragile mortals, hath, I confe&s;s, a good deal interrupted the oeconomy of my former affairs; which were too &s;canty to di&s;tract attention, and too ab&s;tract <HI>from all circumvolutions</HI> to re|quire much <HI>mathematical diligence.</HI> Two days before the &s;udden exit of <HI>him,</HI> to
<PB N="29" REF="46">whom I am indebted for this weight of wealth, I was as &s;till and &s;tudious a man, as bachelor&s;hip and neat 64<HI>l.</HI> 11<HI>s. per annum</HI> could make me. I had a decent collection of cla&s;&s;ics; I had Homer, in hone&s;t &s;heep&s;kin binding; Horace, with a little edging of gold; and Ci|cero, my dear Cicero, with his name upon the back of every volume. I had, be&s;ides, ju&s;t &s;uch a hou&s;hold, as &s;uited well the <HI>propen&s;ities of my &s;eque&s;tered no|tions.</HI> I had an old creature, who pre|pared my beverage, and was &s;o u&s;ed to my humour, that &s;he always went out to cough, when I was at my &s;tudies: I had a toothle&s;s dog, that &s;lept away his lei&s;ure, and was too feeble to di&s;turb me by barking; and my cat was the quiete&s;t animal that ever purred at the elbow of a &s;cholar in a cloi&s;ter: Sombre Hedges were exactly to my pa&s;&s;ion. The two prodigious trees, who&s;e <HI>over|&s;hadowing
<PB N="30" REF="47">ramifications</HI> &s;pread, the <HI>&s;ublime of darkne&s;s vi&s;ible</HI> over my cottage, gave &s;uch a <HI>&s;et-off</HI> to my &s;tudy, that I was ab&s;olutely the hero of an hermitage. I &s;at and read, till I fancied my&s;elf, in <HI>the fervor of the intellectual feelings,</HI> a philo|&s;opher in the &s;hades. In the dim hour of evening I u&s;ed to be the companion of the &s;ooty-pinioned bat, and walked forth to meditate on the readings I had made in the day. I rejoiced in the name that the people of the village gave me, and I had a &s;ecret pride in &s;eeing them in the twilight, &s;tealing a look at the learned gentleman in the dark hou&s;e i'th' mid&s;t of Sombre Hedges. I was ju&s;t lighting up my lamp, and &s;etting down to a chapter of Cicero, with Gri|malkin by my &s;ide, when news of my new honours, broke like too mighty a flood of light, upon the &s;erenity of my darkne&s;s. I was dazzled, and knew
<PB N="31" REF="48">not what to do. For want of habitude, wealth, like a robe fir&s;t put on, and made <HI>not con&s;onant to our u&s;ual fa&s;hion,</HI> &s;at unea&s;y upon me. As my &s;oul was not fitted to my fortune, neither was my fortune fitted to my &s;oul. I hit upon a pa&s;&s;age, where Tully, the prince of La|tian eloquence, recommended an equal mind in all revolutions; an hour <HI>before,</HI> I &s;hould have given to the very printed page an holy ki&s;s of approbation, but, at pre&s;ent, it was no &s;uch matter:&mdash;I was now to con&s;ider my&s;elf as ma&s;ter of ten thou&s;and pounds, and I was taken &s;o unawares that I trimmed my lamp in order to &s;ee the <HI>will</HI> clearer; and when I had the misfortune to find the thing was <HI>certain,</HI> I was much agitated, and crept at length into the clo&s;et, which contained the whole&s;ome bed of a &s;cho|lar, upon the &s;urface of which I laid
<PB N="32" REF="49">down, with a heart that throbbed, and a head that ach'd till the morning.</P>
<P>I ro&s;e early, brother, but not to my accu&s;tomed &s;atisfaction, for I found my feelings were altered. Tho&s;e &s;mall, but dear attentions, which the day before belonged to an e&s;tate of 60<HI>l. per</HI> year, were over. I could not any longer think I was the proprietor of a &s;nug box, when the load of ten thou&s;and pounds &s;ell abruptly upon my &s;houlders in the lump. I never looked into a book that whole day, and to &s;ay truth, I hardly thought there was a <HI>cover</HI> in my &s;tudy fit to come into the hand of a man of fortune. Was it not &s;ome Demon, think you, that put it into my head to take down, three days after, the only <HI>coxcomb</HI> volume in my whole library? and the &s;cope of this was to recommend ta&s;te, elegance, fa&s;hion, and commerce
<PB N="33" REF="50">with men, on purpo&s;e to give a fini&s;hing to the man of &s;peculation. With an avidity for which I de&s;pi&s;e my&s;elf, did I peru&s;e this work quite through, and from that moment I became a prophane, excentric, di&s;&s;ipated fellow. I &s;aid unto the woodman, Fell me tho&s;e horrid trees that hide me from <HI>the blooming face of Phoebus;</HI> down in&s;tantly with the&s;e chil|dren of darkne&s;s, that there may be light. I am a&s;hamed to tell you, that I di|rected my windows to be cleaned; yea, even the little lattice that emitted &s;carce half a &s;un-beam into my library, and which was almo&s;t vegetable with the over-growth of ivy, did I order to be laid bare to all the &s;plendors of day&mdash; Why &s;hould I conceal the mo&s;t <HI>egregious</HI> of my follies? I have at this minute two artificers in my hou&s;e, and perhaps the pa&s;&s;ion may gain &s;uch &s;way in a few hours, that, by to-morrow, the corner|&s;tone
<PB N="34" REF="51">of the building may not be &s;uffered to &s;tand. I am already <HI>not</HI> the dark gentleman of Sombre Hedges, but the poor fellow who hath, like a &s;wal|low in the winter, emerged un&s;ea&s;on|ably from his corner, to blind him&s;elf with light. Upon the whole, my heart, like my hou&s;e, is totally di&s;arranged.

<HEAD>In an&s;wer.</HEAD>
<P>I LIKE you ten times better than ever; for I finds <HI>you</HI> are as much altered as <HI>I</HI> am. There never was a more mi&s;erable dog than either of us. I dare not &s;ay this <HI>before,</HI> for fear you &s;hould laugh at me; but now, that I find you are as &s;trange a fellow as my|&s;elf, I tell you, without farther <HI>permable,</HI> that I hant &s;hot a partridge <HI>this</HI> three weeks, and my dogs are yelping in the kennel for fre&s;h air and their &s;port. People now give me &s;o much <HI>joy</HI> when I go about, that I am quite
<PB N="36" REF="53">mi&s;erable. My wife HETTY, too, has been <HI>at</HI> me about <HI>plitene&s;s,</HI> and bids me look in the gla&s;s to &s;ee if it is not a &s;in and a &s;hame, for &s;uch a <HI>par|&s;onable</HI> man as I to go &s;uch a figure, and &s;hut my&s;elf up in an old timber hou&s;e among hounds and hor&s;es, guns and game traps. She &s;ays I &s;hould be a very <HI>&s;ightly</HI> man, if beard was &s;moothed oft|ner, and ruffles put on wri&s;t-bands, after the fa&s;hion of young Captain CARLISLE. She &s;ays, too, we might now alter our cour&s;e of life, and live upon our wealth like Mr. and Mrs. Somebody, in a dif|ferent gue&s;s place than Helter Skelter Hall. Upon this I clapt me on a clean &s;hirt, and a pair of &s;ilken &s;tockings, after I had doft leathern hunting breeches; and, without <HI>&s;hamming,</HI> I ve|rily thought, what with the powder in my hair, and ribbon behind in beau|knot, not forgetting black crevat,
<PB N="37" REF="54">which the jade tied &s;o as to make me look&mdash;I don't know how&mdash;I was one of your <HI>bettermo&s;t</HI> per&s;ons. As I was walk|ing along the large hall thus <HI>quipp'd,</HI> old Da&s;hgrove, the &s;etting bitch, barked at me, as if &s;he did not known Ma&s;ter HENRY thro' his finery, upon which I lent her a <HI>douze,</HI> to teach her how to behave to man of <HI>plitene&s;s:</HI> after this, Tippler the &s;paniel came and fawn'd on me, leaving the track of her paws on my &s;ilken &s;tockings, upon which I fa|voured her al&s;o with &s;uch a <HI>flick</HI> that the poor thing howled for a quarter of an hour. In &s;hort, I can't help &s;peaking <HI>ha&s;h,</HI> and taking a little upon me, more than u&s;ual: and this was partly the <HI>ca&s;ion</HI> of my writing you &s;uch a rough letter; for, I finds I am grown devili&s;h <HI>touchey,</HI> &s;ince I <HI>came</HI> to be a great man; and SUSAN, the maid, &s;ays, I am not like to be much the <HI>better</HI> for my riches;
<PB N="38" REF="55">&s;eeing, that I have got <HI>them,</HI> and lo&s;t my good-nature. I am mo&s;t con&s;um|edly troubled to know <HI>what to do;</HI> and, mayhap, <HI>that</HI> makes me growl more than I otherwi&s;e &s;hould. Sometimes I think of giving up my farm at Skelter, &s;ometimes of buying racing hor&s;es; &s;ometimes of making my&s;elf <HI>cu&s;&s;ed</HI> gay in the <HI>pareil</HI> way; &s;ometimes I have a mind to <HI>crackle</HI> it away in a coach; &s;ometimes to put wor&s;ted of different colours on JOE JOBSON's coat, and clap a <HI>cue</HI> to his head&mdash;But then again I can't help telling HETTY, this would be damn'd non&s;en&s;e for a <HI>feller</HI> like I, who have as good a pair of legs as ever worked under a man, and who has gone rough as he run <HI>this</HI> many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> day. I wi&s;h grandfather had thought fit to let us know what he meant to do for us about four or five years <HI>agone,</HI> that we might have prepared our&s;elves to be gentlemen
<PB N="39" REF="56">again&s;t he died. With &s;uch warning I don't doubt but I &s;hould have been &s;cho|lar enough to deck my&s;elf off, to &s;trut forth with a little black bag at the end o'me, and to have popp'd in and out of a carriage, very decently: for, damn it, I know how the thing &s;hould <HI>goe,</HI> tho' I can't &s;o neatly <HI>do</HI> it. As to Cap|tain CARLISLE, neither you nor I can ever expect to cut the <HI>da&s;h, he</HI> cuts; 'ca&s;e why? he was papp'd in <HI>plitene&s;s,</HI> and &s;uck'd civility in his cradle: be&s;ides which, he has travelled for it, far and near; &s;o that all the difference in that there matter lies only in the alteration you know. But for all that, if we could, when he comes from <HI>broad</HI> (which is to be &s;oon) get <HI>into's</HI> company now and then, and take notice how he carries him&s;elf, how he talks, opens his lips, and the like, I don't doubt but we could make our&s;elves no &s;mall fools, in the
<PB N="40" REF="57">way of <HI>haviour,</HI> when he is not <HI>by.</HI> At pre&s;ent, as I can't think of doing as I did, becau&s;e HETTY &s;ays, that would be very unnatural; I am horridly <HI>out of &s;orts,</HI> and know not what will be the end <HI>on't.</HI> I think, as you are the be&s;t &s;cholard, you ought to write to Mr. DE GREY <HI>bout</HI> it, cau&s;e he had once the care of us, and, as the world &s;ays, made Captain CARLISLE what he is.</P>
<P>To live thus, is out of the que&s;tion, &s;o pray think of mending the matter. HETTY is airing me another ruffled &s;hirt, and &s;ays, I mu&s;t &s;hift every day now I am a man of property. The linen is rare and hot, &s;o I mu&s;t ene put it on; have only time, therefore, to &s;ay, that</P>

<P>I WRITE this to my dear LASCELLES, with a hand that trembles for the &s;ituation of your fair charge. She di&s;covered, methought, as I deli|vered her to you, an impatience of temper that may be fatal. She talks of her hu&s;band with an ardour of re&s;ent|ment that I believe it is impo&s;&s;ible &s;o ac|compli&s;hed a man &s;hould have de&s;erved. I feel a compunction, not very unlike reproach, at being obliged to refu&s;e her my addre&s;s. Do you not agree with me, that &s;trong marks of di&s;approbation
<PB N="48" REF="65">were painted in her countenance, when I ob&s;erved, that all her &s;entiments would reach me by inclo&s;ing them, either &s;ealed or un&s;ealed, to you? I did propo&s;e to have &s;et out this day for Mr. DE GREY's, but I mu&s;t apologize for a little delay, becau&s;e I judge it be&s;t to &s;ee how &s;he &s;ettles with your family, and to write to the Marquis before I ven|ture into the country, where I had flat|tered my imagination with enjoying the mo&s;t uninterrupted happine&s;s. As &s;he is a native of England, you know, it is po&s;&s;ible you may, by &s;ome means, trace out her relations, &s;ome of whom are, as I have been informed, in Lon|don; and yet, till we have the Mar|quis's an&s;wer, it may perhaps be a more <HI>de|licate</HI> piece of integrity to keep the matter out of every body's mouth, but the worthy family to whom it was nece&s;&s;ary to entru&s;t it. On &s;econd thoughts, therefore, I beg
<PB N="49" REF="66">matter may re&s;t where it is, in your faithful bo&s;om, and in that of Mi&s;s LASCELLES. In the mean time, if AUGUSTA remains prudent and com|po&s;ed, the whole indi&s;cretion may be done away: every thing may be hu&s;hed, and the Marquis be again made happy, without the confu&s;ion of being con|gratulated by people, who turn acci|dents into table-talk. For my <HI>own</HI> part, I dare &s;ay, it will be ea&s;y for me to convince the hu&s;band that I dealt ho|nourably. At be&s;t, the dilemma is very di&s;plea&s;ing, and the only way le&s;t, is to act in it, and to &s;truggle through it, as becomes a man of prudence and principle.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WERE it not that your &s;itu|ation called rather for condolence than mirth, I could acquaint you, in very jocular language, of a circum&s;tance that carries with it the air of an adventure in the days of chivalry.</P>
<P>The heroine, or rather the lady-errant of this enterprize, is your AUGUSTA, who, taking advantage of your journey
<PB N="60" REF="77">about the time of my departure, was re&s;olved to be even with you for the anxieties of &s;eparation, and &s;o paid you <HI>in kind</HI> by taking a trip to England. I dare &s;ay &s;he intended, at fir&s;t, only to amu&s;e her&s;elf with a &s;hort excur&s;ion to deceive the time till your return: but the &s;pirited creature, with all that ardor which, you know, belongs to her cha|racter, laid her plan of operation in &s;uch a manner, that, when &s;he was once em|barked, it was ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to retreat. She contrived the matter &s;o as to pa&s;s upon every body for an Italian &s;tripling travelling to Eng|land, properly equipped for the opera hou&s;e: the better to &s;upport which, &s;he was provided with &s;uitable habi|liments, and above all, a di&s;tingui&s;h|ing kind of head-dre&s;s, that ma&s;ked her from every thing but the mo&s;t critical in&s;pection. It will demand all your
<PB N="61" REF="78">be&s;t opinion of my veracity, to credit me when I prote&s;t to you, that &s;he e&s;caped <HI>my</HI> notice through the whole journey, nor was I acquainted with any part of the circum&s;tance till, in compleating the project, &s;he di&s;covered her&s;elf to me in my own apartments in London. It was not for <HI>me</HI> to upbraid her upon the principle of the pain you was &s;uffering; nor was it proper &s;he &s;hould remain with one, who has not the honour to be in the married &s;tate. I therefore ad|vi&s;ed her to be as ea&s;y as her reflec|tions would allow, at the hou&s;e of a particular friend of mine, who has a &s;i&s;ter that will pre&s;erve her &s;afe, till &s;he is once more in the arms of her Mar|quis. The &s;tep &s;he has taken was cer|tainly carrying the joke too far, and, no doubt, &s;he her&s;elf thinks &s;o; but when you con&s;ider her youth, her high &s;pirits, her well-known fidelity to you, and
<PB N="62" REF="79">above all, the perils &s;he has &s;afely pa&s;&s;ed, without a &s;ingle &s;oul to protect her, you have, I think, on the whole, rather more rea&s;on to laugh it off as a frolic, than to chide her for it as an im|propriety.</P>
<P>Whatever mode of receiving her you propo&s;e &s;hall be attended to, and if you cannot come all the way your&s;elf, I will &s;ee that &s;he is re-conducted to the bor|ders of Italy, or even to your very hou&s;e in Rome, or to that in Paris, if you judge it nece&s;&s;ary.

<P>WHAT is to be done now, my dear LASCELLES?&mdash;a circum&s;tance hath fallen out, even wor&s;e than the affair of AUGUSTA. Mr. DE GREY forgot to inform me, that the only per|&s;on whom I &s;hould not meet at Pru|dence Green would make a di&s;tingui&s;h|ed member of his &s;ummer &s;ociety!

<P>OH, my beloved CAROLINE! Mr. CARLISLE is at our hou&s;e, and yet I am more wretched than I was before his arrival. He certainly dete&s;ts me.

<P>BETTER and better &s;till! the gudgeons bite this warm weather at Prudence Place mo&s;t gloriou&s;ly. Every minute teems with ridicule.

In my opinion, my Lady, &s;aid I, it bears &s;trong marks of the Duche&s;s of Letterblot; that copious command of capitals in the L.O.R.D. looks a&s;toni&s;hingly like the finger and thumb of her Grace.&mdash;Whew, &s;ays my uncle, there's no po&s;t-marks: I can't po&s;&s;ibly account for this, my Lady.

<P>That's very true, aunt, &s;aid I, and it's perfectly unpardonable in that little, low-minded mono&s;yllable <HI>Mr.</HI> to behave thus rudely to names of a nobler &s;ound, and a different con&s;truction. <HI>Mr.</HI> in|deed! I &s;hould not have thought of it!</P>

<P>Sen&s;ible of that, my Lord, &s;aid I, her Lady&s;hip's fine blood &s;hines be&s;ide her fair complexion, like the violet that groweth among the lillies of the valley.</P>

<P>Hang it, rejoined my uncle, forget|ting for a moment his dignity, this poor H. HEWSON means no harm after all; he is a poor &s;imple thing.</P>

<P>Do you think &s;o, nephew? cried my uncle and aunt (tickled by the flat|tery); well, then, let us not be offend|ed: let the affair drop.</P>
<P>I do really think, my Lord, rejoined I, if you were to write him an <HI>an&s;wer,</HI>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVII. Captain CARLISLE to GEORGE LASCELLES, E&s;q.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE had a very fooli&s;h ac|cident happen to aggravate the unea&s;ine&s;s of the Marchione&s;s's la&s;t letter. It is in it&s;elf a trifle, yet the con&s;equence to my <HI>peace</HI> will make it important to you. Sir ANDREW FLIGHT was playing off his wittici&s;ms and waggeries upon the igno|rance of &s;ome country &s;impletons that are now at the <HI>Place,</HI> when I became &s;o weary of his vociferous amu&s;ement; for where is the plea&s;ure of &s;porting with inexperience &mdash;that I withdrew to Mr. DE GREY'S garden, unob&s;erved, or at lea&s;t uninter|rupted, by the company. MEDWAY
<PB N="136" REF="153">was watching his fi&s;hing-rod: Lord BLESSINGBOURNE was withdrawn to his chamber for his afternoon's nap. Mr. DE GREY'S garden is exceedingly large, and part of it is di&s;po&s;ed into a wilder|ne&s;s, who&s;e zig-zag is &s;o intricate that you may &s;ometimes have your whole pro&s;pect terminated by a yard's di&s;tance. The &s;urrounding foliage, too, is of the thicke&s;t growth, being &s;uffered to ex|pand for &s;everal years, receiving from the gardener, from time to time, only &s;uch cares and loppings as to render the beautiful confu&s;ion more agreeable. Seats and bowers, apparently artificial, with here and there a dripping grotto, are di&s;tributed irregularly, and the &s;hades are every where &s;o abundant, that the &s;un-beams rather cheer you by <HI>&s;tealth,</HI> than by permi&s;&s;ion. I have, for my own part, an attachment&mdash;a &s;ort of &s;en|timental friend&s;hip, and good-will, for
<PB N="137" REF="154">every bench, and for every tree: they were all favourites of my infancy: I &s;at upon the benches, and I caught in&s;truc|tion from the lips of Mr. DE GREY, under the trees. This, therefore, was the fir&s;t time of my hailing them &s;ince my return. Believe me, I felt &s;en&s;a|tions that thrilled me, as I re-vi&s;ited the places of my accu&s;tomed contemplation; I bade them welcome with as much ar|dour as if they were animate. I walked along the green meander, recognizing my old acquaintances; I li&s;tened to birds who&s;e notes I affected to be <HI>intimate</HI> with my ear, as if they i&s;&s;ued from the &s;ame warblers I had heard formerly. I com|plimented the ca&s;cades upon an <HI>improved</HI> melody in their cadence: every breeze that played upon every leaf, revived the balmy plea&s;ures of infancy. Even in|tercour&s;e with other countries (not odo|rous Italy her&s;elf) had not been able to
<PB N="138" REF="155">&s;upplant the <HI>tenderne&s;s</HI> I bore to the ver|nal beauties of Prudence Place.</P>
<P>Ah, LASCELLES! what could be the rea&s;on of this? Pre&s;ently I came to an alcove, which was originally the archi|tecture of two children, who grew up together. It was a whole week's labour, divided betwixt Mi&s;s DE GREY and your CARLISLE: our little hands twi&s;ted the twigs, formed the archings, and &s;ub|dued the ob&s;tinate &s;hrubs with inconceiv|able indu&s;try. Many a time we re&s;ted from the toil, and, as often being de|lighted with our progre&s;s, we renewed it. When it was compleated, we gave &mdash;oh, I &s;hall never forget it&mdash;a ki&s;s of tendere&s;t congratulation, as at having fini&s;hed a work of <HI>infinite importance.</HI> Big with this innocent flattery, we ran, hand in hand, to our guardian, and with elated hearts bade him &s;urvey well
<PB N="139" REF="156">our workman&s;hip. The gravity with which he commended, and his affected a&s;toni&s;hment at our <HI>ingenuity,</HI> gave the la&s;t and fulle&s;t &s;troke of our pride and vanity. Over the entrance, our guardian cau&s;ed to be imprinted upon a label, in golden letters, this &s;oothing intelligence to the &s;tranger:</P>
<P>This Bower was rai&s;ed by Clement and Lucia.</P>
<P>The robin-redbrea&s;t built in it the next, the <HI>very</HI> next year, and we had then, you know, the be&s;t rea&s;on in the world to think that Heaven it&s;elf was plea&s;ed with our amu&s;ement. The ne&s;t, you may be &s;ure, was pre&s;erved, for both piety and pity were concerned in its protection. We trod with caution while the <HI>&s;acred</HI> bird was hatching: the whole feathered family pre&s;ently took wing; and I do verily believe I hear one of them now whi&s;tling near my window.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="157">
Oh, LASCELLES! how &s;oon is the heart that wi&s;hes to be inoffen&s;ive, lulled by little circum&s;tances! Smile not, then, if I tell you, that I &s;aw with tran&s;port the names of LUCIA and CLEMENT &s;till legible on their bower&mdash;the branches of &s;weetbriar, on either &s;ide, were eagerly extending as if to embrace&mdash;and I beheld the initials of my name very <HI>recently</HI> cut in the rind of a hawthorn, that formed one of the &s;upports of our alcove.</P>
<P>What &s;weet circum&s;tances &mdash; how they melt the heart! cried I.</P>
<P>At that moment the &s;ofte&s;t-tuned voice in the world repeated di&s;tinctly the following ver&s;es, from her favourite poet:</P>
<Q><PB N="141" REF="158">
<LG>
<L>In the&s;e deep &s;olitudes, and aweful cells,</L>
<L>Where heav'nly pen&s;ive Contemplation dwells,</L>
<L>And ever-mu&s;ing Melancholy reigns;</L>
<L>What means this tumult in a Ve&s;tal's veins?</L>
<L>Why rove my thoughts beyon! this la&s;t retreat?</L>
<L>Why feels my heart it's long-forgotten heat?</L>
<L>Yet, yet I <HI>love,</HI> from ABELARD it came,</L>
<L>And ELOISA yet mu&s;t ki&s;s the name.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>You are not to be told it was LUCIA DE GREY. In the next in&s;tant &s;he pa&s;&s;ed within &s;ight of me, the book &s;till in her hand. Unprepared on both &s;ides for the &s;urprize, we were inexpre&s;&s;ibly confu&s;ed. Beautiful lines, Mi&s;s DE GREY, &s;aid I. Yes, indeed, replied &s;he. I think, Mi&s;s DE GREY, in a former part of our life we u&s;ed fre|quently to read the charming Mr. POPE <HI>together</HI>&mdash;In this very garden, Mr. CAR|LISLE; do you recollect your old bower, &s;aid &s;he? If I mi&s;take not, Madam, &s;aid I&mdash;Madam, CLEMENT? Madam,
<PB N="142" REF="159">Mr. CARLISLE? replied &s;he, as if a little offended. I &s;ay, continued I, Mi&s;s DE GREY, if I remember right, <HI>this</HI> is that bower. You had almo&s;t forgot it, then, Mr. CARLISLE, had you? I &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Italy</HI> (the garden of the univer&s;e) hath put all our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ro&s;es quite out of countenance: Prudence Place is, to be &s;ure, a mere nettle-bed.&mdash;Ah, no, Ma|dam! (&s;aid I, upon the edge of an ex|planation, but happily checking my&s;elf in time) though certainly Italy hath its charms. Oh, no doubt of it, replied LUCIA; but I believe, Sir, the com|pany will have lo&s;t their chief felicity by your ab&s;ence. I hear Mr. <HI>Medway</HI> coming; I know his rapid, random &s;tep; and I dare &s;ay his errand is from the de&s;erted &s;ociety to the runaway Cap|tain CARLISLE. If you plea&s;e, Mi&s;s DE GREY, we will retire, then. I will ju&s;t fini&s;h my poem and follow you, Sir.
<PB N="143" REF="160">We parted. 'Tis evident &s;he loves MEDWAY to di&s;traction, LASCELLES &mdash; She <HI>knows his &s;tep.</HI>&mdash;He was then in &s;earch of her, <HI>doubtle&s;s, by her appoint|ment.</HI>&mdash;I wi&s;h them happy&mdash;very, very happy.

I'd give almo&s;t more than I'm worth, if I could but wriggle out the hinder part o'me, ju&s;t like Lord BLESSINGBOURNE: when <HI>he</HI> fir&s;t comes into room, I warrant me, he does no|thing but <HI>treat</HI> and <HI>vance,</HI> &s;huffle and cut, and go backwards and forwards, &s;ticking out his rump, and <HI>craning</HI> his fine, thin, long, meagre, nine-haired head, which I find is the <HI>plite&s;t</HI> head a man can have. Yet he knows who's to have a wriggle of the bum, and who not, too: I warrant you he is a cute one: he don't gig and drop his fine <HI>plite</HI> head to every body alike: no, be|lieve me; he has the mea&s;ure of what's
<PB N="164" REF="181">every man's due, from the Duke to the &s;table-boy.

For at any rate, I ha' gotten fle&s;h on my feace, and a little jot of colour i'my cheeks to &s;et it off, as well as a &s;tout pair of &s;houlders; whereas GAB has werretted all the fle&s;h off's bones by larning. Without a word of a joke, E&s;quire, I don't be|lieve GAB has a pound of &s;ub&s;tance on's whole <HI>carki&s;s;</HI> and as <HI>to's jaws,</HI> has no more meat upon them than upon the bill of chicken: his back is quite a <HI>&s;kelitum;</HI> and though his hair is no bad raven-colour, yet it grows &s;o cu&s;s'd <HI>odd on's head,</HI> and is &s;o <HI>lankum rat-eaten'um,</HI> as a body might
<PB N="166" REF="183">&s;ay, if they were mind to talk larned, that I would not gee frap of a finger <HI>for's whole growth.</HI> But now I'm upon good breeding, E&s;quire, I de&s;ire to know whether a trick I &s;aw Lord BLES|SINGBOURNE (who is ever <HI>acold) do</HI> to|day 'fore men, women, and children, is the <HI>common practi&s;e</HI> of your bettermo&s;t &s;pecie: that is, &s;tanding with bumfiddle to fire with coat up, and now and then popping hand <HI>below</HI> wai&s;tband.

<HEAD>LETTER XLV. Mr. DE GREY to Mr. CARLISLE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Prudence Place.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY be&s;t and deare&s;t CAR|LISLE mu&s;t pardon the formality of re|ceiving an old friend's letter, dated, written, and directed from the &s;ame hou&s;e that contains both the writer and reader of it. The rea&s;on is, Prudence Place is at this time &s;o crouded with different &s;orts of people, and one has &s;o little opportunity to &s;teal lei&s;ure for con|ver&s;ation of the <HI>higher kind,</HI> that I do not imagine a &s;ubject which is at this cri&s;is &s;o very warm at my heart, can be &s;o well or &s;o explicitly handled as upon
<PB N="169" REF="186">paper. So much for the apology: I come now to the <HI>matter.</HI>&mdash;The days, the months, the years of <HI>tuition</HI> are now pa&s;t&mdash;tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons, my CLEMENT, in which I had the honour and the happi|ne&s;s (for it was both) to point out to you the paths of propriety and of virtue, are over; for the <HI>Pupil</HI> is even already, at the mo&s;t early age of twenty-one, be|come the <HI>Preceptor:</HI> he is the <HI>Tutor of Truth:</HI> he hath already got orphans and widows under his guardian&s;hip &mdash; the noble&s;t of all guardian&s;hip, my CLE|MENT&mdash;the guardian&s;hip of <HI>Sen&s;ibility.</HI> I <HI>thank</HI> you, Sir, for doing me &s;o much honour. When you left this country for ITALY, I did not imagine there was room for improvements; you were ami|able, polite, and prudent; as free from pedantry, on the one hand, as from di&s;|&s;ipation and the di&s;tracted joys of an overgrown boy, on the other. Yet, on
<PB N="170" REF="187">my fir&s;t beholding you, the other day, I was &s;truck with an <HI>additional</HI> fini&s;hing, an elegant <HI>compleatne&s;s,</HI> which, though not before &s;eeming to be wanted, was, as it <HI>now</HI> appears, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. Forgive the garrulous vanity of an old man, Sir; forgive me, if I lodge, with all the narrative tediou&s;ne&s;s of age, a little longer on this part of the &s;ubject. There are circum&s;tances, which <HI>allow</HI> us to &s;well out the heart, without making it ridiculous. You, Sir, occa&s;ion in me a pride of this nature. Some men's ambition, in the la&s;t &s;tate of life, is gratified by walking, or rather hobbling, into their fields and gardens, to recognize tho&s;e flouri&s;hing &s;hades which are the produce of their own cul|tivation. I have heard a veteran neigh|bour of mine, a thou&s;and times ex|claim,&mdash;See, Mr. DE GREY, how in|du&s;trious I have been! that long and
<PB N="171" REF="188">lu&s;ty range of oaks, extending from this pa&s;ture even to the farthermo&s;t avenue in the next, did I plant with my own hand.&mdash;I remember the day when the whole row (containing, perhaps, two hundred &s;ticks of timber) were &s;o many petty acorns not &s;o big as a walnut; and &s;ee, only &s;ee how they have &s;ped. I could rai&s;e a little navy&mdash;verily, neigh|bour, I could fit out a fleet, with a wood of my own rai&s;ing.</P>
<P>Such ideas, I own, are not di&s;plea&s;|ing, CLEMENT: but they are far from being expanded enough, for <HI>my</HI> emula|tion; my emulation choo&s;es a nobler object, and takes a wider cour&s;e. My object, Sir, is not circum&s;cribed by any thing within the &s;cope of <HI>inanimate na|ture;</HI> and though I could be able to look out upon whole fore&s;ts of my own cultivation, it would not &s;atisfy me.
<PB N="172" REF="189">No, Mr. CARLISLE, I have a far <HI>finer</HI> plea&s;ure. I have it to &s;ay, that the polite&s;t gentleman, and the be&s;t man of his age, was once the child of my in|&s;truction. He was left by that Hea|ven, which took to it&s;elf his natural parents, at an age when gentle treat|ment makes a parent of any one. I received this dear and delicate tru&s;t from the trembling arm of a dying man, and I value it, as a legacy given me in the moment that the &s;oul of a friend was departing. Yes, at &s;uch a tender period, was you bequeathed to me, Mr. CAR|LISLE: my child, LUCIA, was exactly of the &s;ame age; and you grew together. The beauty of your forms, like the power of your minds, was &s;imilar. I can only &s;ay farther, that nature points out to me none of her nice di&s;tinctions or partia|lities. In the hour of your childhood I care&s;&s;ed you both with the &s;ame &s;en&s;i|bility,
<PB N="173" REF="190">and now that you are mature I divide my heart <HI>evenly</HI> between you. But this touch of tran&s;port hath &s;educ|ed me into a digre&s;&s;ion. Old folks are, I perceive, on their favourite &s;ubject, as tire&s;ome in their writing as in their talking; and therefore they have as few corre&s;pondents as hearers. It is time, however, to return to my &s;ubject.</P>
<P>On looking back at my account|book, my dear Mr. CARLISLE, I find that your birth-day hath gone by almo&s;t a month. You &s;eem to have forgot that it entitles you to the command and &s;ole di&s;po&s;ition of an immen&s;e fortune. Mo|ney was, I am proud to &s;ay, never a di&s;putable point with us, except when coercive mea&s;ures were obliged to be taken in order to force upon you a re|mittance. This, however, by no means exculpates me for detaining what ought
<PB N="174" REF="191">to be in more amiable, as well as more able hands. I reproach my&s;elf, when I con&s;ider how many cruelties my delay may have been guilty of, Mr. CARLISLE, to tho&s;e who&s;e fortunes <HI>you</HI> have in tru&s;t: methinks, I hear the cur&s;e of the wi|dow, the langui&s;hing &s;igh of &s;ickne&s;s, and the murmur of merit in the dark|&s;ome vale: I &s;ee, too, the tears &s;tream from the eyes of the fatherle&s;s&mdash;Oh! for Heaven's &s;ake, my friend, relieve me&mdash;re&s;cue me, in&s;tantly, from conti|nuing the injury to that part of your family which Providence hath put un|der your care.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, mo&s;t readily, be prepared to render up an ample account of my agency, whenever (and the &s;ooner the better) you will honour me with your appointment.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="192">
Thus much for <HI>fortune.</HI> I had it in my mind, CLEMENT, to venture a few &s;entiments upon <HI>happine&s;s,</HI> which are, by no means, things incompatible, al|though they are not often in&s;eparable. But any thing I could advance on this head is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;uch a <HI>mind</HI> as your's. With re&s;pect to your <HI>heart,</HI> I own, I meditated a few words upon <HI>that</HI> &s;ubject al&s;o: but I am in great doubt, whether this is the proper point of time to &s;peak to it; yet my propen&s;ity is &s;o warm, and the prattling, or rather, at pre&s;ent, &s;cribbling, old man, is &s;o &s;trong, or, to &s;peak more truly, &s;o <HI>feeble</HI> in me, that I can &s;carce re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>The intere&s;t of your heart mu&s;t naturally, my dear CLEMENT, be of more concern to me than any other that belongs to you. You are exactly at the age when tenderne&s;s falls with the
<PB N="176" REF="193">fulle&s;t force upon our nature; as you have a form to command love, &s;o have you feeling to return it. That &s;en&s;ibi|lity, which makes you a parent to the poor, and tho&s;e accompli&s;hments which endear you to &s;ociety, in general, will a&s;&s;i&s;t and even lead to connexions of a &s;ofter kind. I am afraid, it would border a little upon that impertinence which I would avoid, el&s;e I &s;hould a&s;k you, in the cordiality of my good wi&s;hes, whether it is <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> for &s;o amia|ble a man, to have pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>Italy,</HI> and to have re&s;ided in the capital of England, (the very court of female beauty) with an inclination unattached, and pa&s;&s;ions unalarmed. This is too great a paradox for me to credit, even in imagination; and yet, I am <HI>mightily intere&s;ted</HI> in the que&s;tion and its an|&s;wer. Perhaps you will humour an old friend's <HI>caprices,</HI> and, for once, tru&s;t
<PB N="177" REF="194">him (who can be no rival) with a love|&s;ecret. Suppo&s;e you were to &s;teal an hour from the &s;trange mixture of our pre&s;ent family, and &s;cribble a line or two on this matter. I di&s;patch this by your tru&s;ty grey-headed GEOFFREY, who, you know, may be the confident of eve|ry me&s;&s;age that can come from &s;uch a ma&s;ter.</P>

<P>YOU confe&s;s then that you have written to the dete&s;ted Marquis: you even avow the &s;entiments of your letter to him; you own, that they are to <HI>ha&s;ten him to England.</HI> But do you think, Sir, I am to be thus treated like a child, and threatened with being chid by that bugbear, <HI>my hu&s;band?</HI> or do you imagine, I will ever allow my&s;elf to be re-united to him. Prepo&s;terous ex|pectation! No, Mr. CARLISLE, tho' I am a &s;lave to my own pa&s;&s;ions, I will
<PB N="180" REF="197">never more be a &s;lave to tho&s;e of ano|ther! You argue in vain about rights and laws and duties&mdash;in vain you urge the maxims of the world, and the cu&s;|tom of nations. I have lived &s;o long under the Italian heavens, that I have forgot&mdash;utterly forgot&mdash;the colder atmo|phere of cloudy England. I have learn|ed to follow my feelings, and to abhor chains that were forced upon me by pa|ternal authority. You direct me to the &s;acred circle of gold upon my fingers; you call it the cae&s;tus of fidelity. I grew enraged to con&s;ider a man, &s;carce more than twenty, thus coldly argue upon a tender offer of no contemptible pa&s;&s;ion. My <HI>pride</HI> took the alarm, and I tore your epi&s;tle, and threw the ring from my finger at the &s;ame time. I &s;tampt upon it with indignation. Mi&s;s LASCELLES appeared, and, as if you had pre-in&s;tructed her, &s;he acted upon
<PB N="181" REF="198">the occa&s;ion as the very prie&s;te&s;s of pie|ty. "Fie, my dear Marchione&s;s, (&s;aid &s;he, folding her palms together in the true conventicle manner) the&s;e outrages are ever dreadful, but when they ari&s;e from &s;o bad a <HI>cau&s;e,</HI> what &s;trength of terms can &s;ufficiently reprobate them!

<P>Ah! what have I &s;aid? To what violation of the truth hath my pa&s;&s;ion led me? No, my CARLISLE, no; I would not wi&s;h to hate you&mdash;wretched as I am, I would not even wi&s;h to love you le&s;s. Though the agony is extreme, there are moments of tran&s;port, known only to bo&s;oms like mine, that repay me for it.

<HEAD>LETTER XLVII. Captain CARLISLE to Mr. LASCELLES.</HEAD>
<P>MY dilemma is even greater than before. The inclo&s;ed, from Mr. DE GREY, is even more perplexing than that which you tran&s;mitted from the Marchione&s;s. Both perplex my ima|gination, in what manner to an&s;wer them. Mr. DE GREY'S rea&s;on for in|quiring into the &s;tate of my affections, is, evidently, for fear my return to Prudence Place, (now that his daugh|ter is in the full bloom of her &s;en&s;e and beauty there) &s;hould in&s;pire me with a pa&s;&s;ion that, he knows, would terminate in de&s;pair; appri&s;ed too as he is of her engagement to Mr. MEDWAY.
<PB N="187" REF="204">It is very natural for him to imagine I &s;hould fall into this charming tempta|tion; &s;o that this is a little generous &s;tratagem (under the gui&s;e of ordinary curio&s;ity) to prevent the mortification, and the mi&s;ery in time. Mr. MEDWAY is &s;o &s;ingular a man, that, if he did not con&s;tantly a&s;&s;ure me almo&s;t every time he &s;ees me, that his pa&s;&s;ion runs before the wind, I &s;hould &s;carce credit, that a per&s;on whom I hardly ever &s;aw &s;peak to Mi&s;s DE GREY, &s;hould have made &s;uch a progre&s;s in her affections. It is plain, however, now from her <HI>own</HI> conduct, that &s;he is fervently at|tached; for her addre&s;s, air, manner, and whole deportment to me, are utter|ly changed. I am no longer delighted by that lovely affability, which, though playful, was ever corrected by mode&s;ty. She no longer con&s;ults my ta&s;te, which &s;he was wont to flatter, about her
<PB N="188" REF="205">dre&s;s, her ornaments, and ten thou&s;and innocent trifles, that, neverthele&s;s, (tri|fles as they are) make up the chief en|dearment of dome&s;tic &s;ociety. She &s;peaks in form; her eye is averted; her &s;entiments &s;ound <HI>&s;tudied.</HI> We are no longer like CLEMENT and LUCIA, who employed their infant cares in rearing the <HI>&s;ame bower.</HI> Mr. DE GREY'S letter therefore, joined to Mr. MEDWAY'S a&s;&s;urances, and Mi&s;s DE GREY'S beha|viour point out to me, pretty plainly, what kind of an an&s;wer it is proper for me to make to the former. I am &s;ome|what con&s;oled to reflect, that, even in my mo&s;t familiar moments, I never en|tered flatly into overtures with LUCIA, &s;o that I cannot create any unea&s;ine&s;s in her bo&s;om upon my account; for, had that been the ca&s;e, her &s;en&s;ibility is &s;o uncommon, LASCELLES, &s;he would have felt for <HI>my</HI> di&s;appointment, amid&s;t
<PB N="189" REF="206">all the gaity of her own &s;ucce&s;&s;es. Since <HI>her</HI> heart is happily engaged (if &s;he <HI>thinks</HI> it &s;o, it certainly <HI>is</HI> &s;o) it now becomes a duty, more than ever, in me, to <HI>conceal</HI> the feelings of <HI>mine.</HI> Whatever be the violence of my pa&s;|&s;ion, it has no right to be trouble&s;ome to any other bo&s;om: and I was never able to account for that cowardly con|duct, which induces us to embitter the joy of a rival and a mi&s;tre&s;s becau&s;e they were more fortunate or happy than our&s;elves. Be&s;ide, that &s;uch complaints never awaken more than compa&s;&s;ion which is not de&s;irable, they aggravate di&s;appointment till it ru&s;hes upon di&s;|grace. But, methinks I hear you re|tort upon me: "Why trouble <HI>me</HI> with your mi&s;ery then, CLEMENT?" Ah LASCELLES, we are not &s;uch ab&s;tracted beings as to lock up our &s;entiments, either of joy or &s;orrow, in ab&s;olute &s;o|litude. The very thoughts would &s;tag|nate,
<PB N="190" REF="207">by &s;uch means.

<P>With re&s;pect to the Marchione&s;s, I am every way &s;o circum&s;tanced that I am puzzled even to reply to her. It would be too much like affectation, and a kind of male prudery in me to &s;ay, that, if matters were in another channel, I &s;hould not be flattered by this over|bearing tide of tenderne&s;s in &s;o beauti|ful an object. Heaven knows I am not <HI>in&s;en&s;ible</HI> to the charms of beauty. Some|thing that at this moment pre&s;&s;es hard upon my heart, convinces me I am not. But &s;ituated as I am, how is it po&s;&s;ible to receive &s;uch a letter as her la&s;t with|out
<PB N="192" REF="209">di&s;tre&s;s? Believe me, LASCELLES, I feel no elation at the compliment of &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a preference, although I acknowledge the Marchione&s;s to be as you &s;ay, with your favourite Yorick, "among&s;t the fir&s;t order of fine forms." I acknowledge too her command over the pa&s;&s;ions: her fire; her eloquence; the delicacy of her &s;hape; the dignity of her deportment: yet, I feel nothing but anxiety at her pre&s;ent conduct. The rea&s;on you will &s;ay, is, my &s;ecret attachment to <HI>another.</HI> Be it &s;o. Yet, were even that barrier removed, I &s;hould, I am po&s;itive, &s;till be unhappy, and not flattered, by the attentions of the charm|ing Marchione&s;s. You are an animated man, and no doubt call me a cold|blooded creature! By no means. My pa&s;&s;ions are as lively as they generally are in <HI>any</HI> bo&s;om at my age, but, per|haps, my <HI>ta&s;te of voluptuou&s;ne&s;s</HI> differs a
<PB N="193" REF="210">little from the general juvenile idea. I have a great plea&s;ure in plea&s;ing <HI>my own mind:</HI> nay, I have a great <HI>intere&s;t</HI> in &s;o doing; whenever I have done wrong, I have always found that the pain re&s;ult|ing from it, is too heavy to be counter|balanced by the plea&s;ure which pro|duced it. I have my wayward propen|&s;ities as well as another: a whim hath often &s;eized me by the heart, and I have at all events indulged it. For <HI>the time,</HI> it was exta&s;y, and, for ought I can tell, the exta&s;y was heightened by a &s;en&s;e of the <HI>venture</HI> at which the deed was done. Pre&s;ently (and indeed clo&s;e upon the heel of it) comes the <HI>per con|tra</HI> of the action, if you will &s;uffer me to borrow a term from trade.

<PB N="194" REF="211">wrong, or uneven, again&s;t the cau&s;e of that integrity which I profe&s;s to love, the thorns are from that moment in my bo&s;om, and for &s;o much mirth, I am rewarded &s;even-fold in mi&s;ery. I am &s;o con&s;tructed that I can no more &s;tand again&s;t the rebuff of a blu&s;h on my own cheek than again&s;t the thunder of a cannon: the &s;igh which my weak|ne&s;s may at any time have extorted from another bo&s;om, agonizes my own; and a tear, which I once, very unde|&s;ignedly, drew from an innocent crea|ture, haunts me from place to place, and the precious drop, for it was wrung from the eyes of <HI>Lucia,</HI> is &s;till trembling in my imagination.</P>
<P>I have enlarged upon this &s;ubject, becau&s;e my behaviour might want (to your fancy) an apology. That people do not all act on the &s;ame principle, is,
<PB N="195" REF="212">becau&s;e they do not all analyze the real cau&s;e of that angui&s;h which &s;o often treads upon plea&s;ure. There is, me|thinks, one &s;imple law, that comprizes all the wi&s;dom of the prophets, and all the &s;agacity of philo&s;ophers: I feel it better than I can de&s;cribe it; but to give you &s;ome idea of it, I &s;hall ju&s;t lay it down as a note, that, whenever a man is upon the edge of an enjoyment, (let it relate to whatever part of indulgence it may) he has only to con&s;ider, whe|ther it will not, &s;ooner or latter, be re|turned by <HI>more</HI> than an equal mi&s;ery: if, however, even the pro&s;pect of <HI>greater pain</HI> does not deter, let him hazard the joy: then while the <HI>actual agony</HI> is full upon him, let him again compare the <HI>actual plea&s;ure:</HI> after this, his heart mu&s;t be very perver&s;e, and his head very much intoxicated, if for the future his plea&s;ures are not &s;uch as will not
<PB N="196" REF="213"><HI>burt</HI> him after they are over. Innocent plea&s;ures are, indeed, <HI>never</HI> over: they &s;pring directly from the &s;oul; and like that, they are immortal. Like mercy too, they are "twice ble&s;t:" they de|light us while they are acting, and con|&s;cience makes them &s;acred in reflec|tion.</P>
<P>It is upon this principle I am pro|ceeding with regard to AUGUSTA. She is the wife of a man to whom I had the honour to tender what he reckoned an obligation. This makes his property more e&s;pecially &s;acred to me. She is, al&s;o, the wife of a man whom, not|with&s;tanding the roughne&s;s of his man|ners, I believe to be valuable. She is <HI>in tru&s;t</HI>&mdash;In &s;hort &s;he is every thing that &s;he &s;hould <HI>not be</HI> to make a mi|&s;tre&s;s of; and as I told you before, my <HI>ta&s;te of voluptuou&s;ne&s;s</HI> mu&s;t have the pre|&s;ent
<PB N="197" REF="214">circum&s;tances wholly inverted &mdash; that is to &s;ay&mdash;&s;he mu&s;t be unmarried, and <HI>aver&s;e</HI> to marriage; unconnected, and unclaimed in the way of connexion, and I, unattached too&mdash;before I could congratulate my&s;elf upon the conque&s;t of this flower of Italy.</P>
<P>Yet, till the Marquis comes, for Heaven's &s;ake u&s;e every method to &s;oothe, and quiet her: do not advi&s;e your &s;i&s;ter to oppo&s;e her in the heat of her &s;entiments. She is too furious for admonition. Her imagination is too much in its hey dey. Her pa&s;&s;ions will die of them&s;elves; and &s;he will con&s;o|lidate perhaps, after all, into a regular character. Her &s;ituation with you is &s;o very delicate, that I know your &s;i&s;ter is in a dilemma; but &s;till, AU|GUSTA has many virtues. I have &s;een a thou&s;and in&s;tances of her benevolence:
<PB N="198" REF="215">the Italian pea&s;ants ble&s;s her door, and ki&s;s the very thre&s;hold of it, becau&s;e imprinted by her foot&s;teps. She is at this time under the influence of <HI>Fancy;</HI> it is a &s;ort of feveri&s;h fit that attacks &s;martly at fir&s;t, and will away again. The hand&s;ome creature is but ju&s;t touching nineteen. She is a child, my dear LASCELLES, and this truant di&s;po|&s;ition is a trick of the leading &s;tring: without parents and of a vigorous ima|gination, &s;he is yet, as to human life, in the nur&s;ery. No more, my friend&mdash; think not of her as of one abandoned: that is not the ca&s;e. As to her glowing language, let not that di&s;plea&s;e your &s;i&s;ter, though unaccu&s;tomed to her ear. The Italian women know nothing of that re&s;erve and pathetic ba&s;hfulne&s;s, which guards the expre&s;&s;ions of the Bri|ti&s;h fair. They &s;peak freely and flow|ingly&mdash;the Marchione&s;s adds to the

Her pride was hurt. She thought it beneath the dignity of the man who had figured at the front of an army&mdash;&s;he never forgave it&mdash;'twas wrong. But who hath not a fault to be forgiven? Fare|well. I have written my&s;elf into &s;ome compo&s;ure, and that will plead my ex|cu&s;e for having &s;o long intruded.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLVIII. Mi&s;s DE GREY to Mi&s;s LASCELLES.</HEAD>
<P>SURELY every day is com|mi&s;&s;ioned to pre&s;ent &s;ome new my&s;tery, and no hour decreed to unfold or ex|plain it! My father whi&s;pered, as I &s;at at dinner ye&s;terday, that he had a little private conver&s;ation for me, and would contrive an opportunity very &s;oon to chat with me. You know his me|thod of treating his children, CARO|LINE. Towards the clo&s;e of the even|ing (when Lord and Lady BLESSING|BOURNE were airing, Mrs. HEWSON at her looking-gla&s;s, where &s;he is prac|ti&s;ing breeding, Mr. MEDWAY at the
<PB N="201" REF="218">river with his fi&s;hing-rod, and Mr. CAR|LISLE at his writing-de&s;k) we found the lei&s;ure we wanted, and walked into the garden together. We will &s;ettle a little while in this very bower, my dear, &s;ays my father: 'tis as pretty and cooling as any in the garden.</P>
<P>Oh, CAROLINE, it was the bower of CLEMENT and LUCIA!</P>
<P>Yes, Sir, replied I; it is very pretty and cooling, indeed.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, LUCIA, your fellow-la|bourer who helped to make it has not paid it a vi&s;it &s;ince his return. Such humble &s;hades mu&s;t yield to the &s;pices of Italy. He has, to be &s;ure, forgot an arbour of mere Engli&s;h hawthorns and woodbines.</P>
<P>I &mdash; I &mdash; believe he has, Sir.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="219">
A-propos, LUCIA, do you hold in the &s;ame mind &s;till? Do you &s;till think him the <HI>incomparable</HI> CARLISLE? Pru|dence Place can boa&s;t ju&s;t at pre|&s;ent, <HI>&s;everal</HI> brilliant men. We have the laughter-loving Sir ANDREW, of a ve|ry agreeable per&s;on. We have the man|ly Mr. MEDWAY, odd, but amiable. Putting the&s;e both again&s;t Mr. CAR|LISLE, is he &s;till the <HI>&s;uperlative</HI> degree? There are two to one LUCIA. What &s;ay you?</P>
<P>I believe they have all their merit, Sir.</P>
<P>But is their merit perfectly equal in <HI>your</HI> opinion, my dear?</P>
<P>As to that, Sir, I&mdash;&s;hould &s;uppo&s;e&mdash; no doubt&mdash;that is&mdash;in &s;hort, Sir, as I have not known them all the &s;ame time&mdash;
<PB N="203" REF="220">as one can judge more of intimates than ca&s;ual acquaintances&mdash;</P>
<P>You prefer CLEMENT, I &s;uppo&s;e?</P>
<P>I have known him the longe&s;t, Sir.</P>
<P>MEDWAY, my dear, has great con|nexions.</P>
<P>Sir?</P>
<P>Sir ANDREW has good humour, and will be heir to Lord BLESSINGBOURNE.</P>
<P>Sir &mdash;?</P>
<P>But CARLISLE is the more accom|pli&s;hed gentleman.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t certainly he is, Sir, <HI>beyond compari&s;on.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="221">
Do you think <HI>beyond compari&s;on,</HI> LU|CIA?</P>
<P>Sir&mdash;?</P>
<P>I &s;ay, my dear LUCIA, do you real|ly think&mdash;that&mdash;that?</P>
<P>Ble&s;s me, Sir, how faint the air gets when the breeze falls, at this &s;ea&s;on of the year&mdash;</P>
<P>Yonder comes GEOFFRY.</P>
<P>From Mr. CARLISLE; perhaps upon private bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;I will, if you plea&s;e, withdraw, Sir.</P>
<P>If the heat is trouble&s;ome, pray do, my dear.</P>
<P>Very trouble&s;ome, indeed, Sir&mdash;Lord ble&s;s me! there is not a breath of wind.
<PB N="205" REF="222">As &s;ure as can be, there is a tempe&s;t in the &s;kies.</P>
<P>Thus ended our dialogue&mdash;What does it mean, CAROLINE? I never was more confu&s;ed in my life. What could old GEOFFRY be coming for? The old fellow, who only wi&s;hes him&s;elf young again to di&s;patch with more ha&s;te the commands of his ma&s;ter, quite ran on the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>On my return into the hou&s;e, I met Mr. MEDWAY with an handkerchief full of fi&s;h, and in the highe&s;t degree plea&s;|ed with his &s;ucce&s;s. By way of courte&s;y <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant,</HI> I told him, he mu&s;t certainly carry a <HI>charm</HI> about him to attract &s;o many fi&s;h out of the water in &s;o little a time. Upon which he caught hold of my wri&s;t, and, after looking round the

<P>From this, and &s;ome other &s;trange things, I have &s;een in this man, I am convinced his head is not exactly as it &s;hould be.</P>
<P>Not a view of CARLISLE all this morning &s;ince breakfa&s;t. No &s;ollicita|tion to &s;ing, to touch the guittar, to walk in the garden, to count the fruit, to read Pope, to&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;</P>
<P>It is very barbarous he &s;hould all at once take &s;uch a di&s;like to me!</P>
<P>I wi&s;h Italy had been far enough be|fore he had &s;een it. Pray, my dear,
<PB N="207" REF="224">are the ladies &s;o <HI>very</HI> beautiful in that country? Towards <HI>Rome</HI> for in&s;tance!

<P>HOW pitiable it is, my dear CARLISLE, that you &s;hould be &s;o cir|cum&s;tanced as to find it utterly impo&s;|&s;ible to return the extatic fondne&s;s of this bewitching woman! She is ab&s;o|lutely an angel.

Make a pro&s;titute of the poor girl, Mr. LASCELLES?

This, my dear LASCELLES, is a&s;|&s;uredly the ca&s;e. Be&s;ides which, de|pend upon it, you have <HI>mi&s;taken</HI> the Marchione&s;s.

If it were not for the appearance of an implied compliment to <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> I &s;hould not at all &s;cruple to &s;ay, I be|lieve, any partiality, AUGUSTA may have, unluckily, conceived in my fa|vour, proceeds, wholly, from &s;ome imaginary <HI>virtues</HI> which &s;he is plea&s;ed to think I po&s;&s;e&s;s.
