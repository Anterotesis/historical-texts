<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS work is compo&s;ed from the ob|&s;ervations of perhaps half my life, made without the le&s;t original view of publication, from the numberle&s;s walks taken in and about our capital, with a mind occupied with more ideas than the frivolous vi&s;it, or the mere object of the hour.</P>
<P>SOME were made in company of different friends, &s;tricken, like my&s;elf, with the love of the &s;cience of antiquities; and with the de&s;ire of tracing the progre&s;s of perhaps the fir&s;t city (comparing all its advantages) in the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>THE remarks made in the&s;e latter walks
<PB N="iv" REF="4">
were committed to my tablets till they became rather con&s;iderable. In that &s;tate I determined to lay them before the public, not urged by <HI>de&s;ire</HI> of friends, nor the <HI>wi&s;h</HI> of the people, or any &s;imilar motives, but by my own continued propen&s;ity to writing.</P>
<P>I HAVE two things to apologize for in this performance. Fir&s;t, its irregularity: but I do a&s;&s;ure my friends it is given nearly in the &s;ame manner in which the materials were collected, and quite according to the cour&s;e of the walk of the day.</P>
<P>Secondly, Let me reque&s;t the good inhabi|tants of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> not to be offended at my having &s;tuffed their <HI>Iliad</HI> into a nut-&s;hell: the account of the city of <HI>London,</HI> and liberties of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> into a <HI>quarto</HI> volume. I have conden&s;ed into it all I could; omitted nothing that &s;ugge&s;ted it&s;elf, nor am|plified
<PB N="v" REF="5">
any thing <HI>to make it a guinea book.</HI> In a word, it is done in my own manner, from which I am grown too old to depart.</P>
<P>I FEEL within my&s;elf a certain monitor that warns me to hang up my pen in time, before its powers are weakened, and rendered vi&s;ibly impaired. I wait not for the admonition of friends. I have the archbi&s;hop of <HI>Grenada</HI> in my eye: and fear the imbecility of human nature might produce, in long-worn age, the &s;ame treatment of my kind advi&s;ers, as poor <HI>Gil Blas</HI> had from his mo&s;t reverend patron. My literary beque&s;ts to future times, and more &s;erious concerns, mu&s;t occupy the remnant of my days. This clo&s;es my public labors.</P>
<P>To every particular friend and corre&s;pondent I &s;end my mo&s;t cordial thanks, for their candid and unremitted attention to my various enqui|ries: and for their bearing &s;o long with my
<PB N="vi" REF="6">
yearning after information; and with my un|common curio&s;ity, without which no writer can proceed with the confidence of accuracy, or ought to lay any thing before the public un&s;anctioned by local information. So much for acknowlegement of private favors.&mdash;I take leave of a partial public, with the true&s;t grati|tude for its long endurance of my very volumi|nous writings: for its kind fo&s;tering my few merits: for its affected blindne&s;s to my nume|rous defects. The la&s;t act concluded!</P>

But they preferred &s;pots fortified by nature; and made artificial works only where
<PB N="2" REF="10">
nature &s;hewed her&s;elf deficient. Within &s;uch precincts they formed their towns; their buildings were mo&s;t mean and &s;imple, covered with reeds or &s;ticks like <HI>American</HI> wigwams, or like modern hovels of the pea&s;ants of <HI>Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">haber,</HI> or the cabins of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> commonalty, to this moment as rude as the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> abori|gines. To the&s;e precincts the <HI>Britons</HI> re&s;orted with their cattle, their wives and children <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dioderus Siculus,</HI> lib. v. c. 11.</NOTE>, whom they left thus protected, while they &s;allied out to war, or to the employments of the chace: for their cloathing was the &s;kins of bea&s;ts, and their food the fle&s;h, with the addition of milk, and farinaceous diet. The <HI>Britons</HI> &s;oon became acquainted with one great u&s;e of the cow, notwith|&s;tanding they remained ignorant of the making of chee&s;e till the arrival of the <HI>Romans.</HI> Agriculture was &s;oon introduced among tho&s;e who earlie&s;t formed towns or communities: po&s;&s;ibly by &s;trangers who vi&s;ited them from the continent. They cleared the land in the neighborhood of their dwellings, they &s;owed corn, they reaped and depo&s;ited it in granaries under ground, as the <HI>Sicilians</HI> practi&s;e to this very day; but the latter lodged it in the grain, our predece&s;&s;ors in the ear, out of which they picked the grains as they wanted them, and, ignorant of mills, at fir&s;t brui&s;ed, and then made them into a coar&s;e bread<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Conjuges et liberos in loca tuta transferrent. <HI>Tacitus in vit.

From the <HI>Gauls</HI> of the continent, they received the fir&s;t cloth; the dre&s;s called the <HI>Bracha,</HI> a coar&s;e woollen manu|facture. But probably it was long before they learned the u&s;e of the loom, or became their own manufacturers. This intercour&s;e
<PB N="3" REF="11">
layed the foundation of commerce, which in early times extended no farther than to our maritime places. <HI>They</HI> fir&s;t received the rudiments of civilization, while the more remote remained, in proportion to their di&s;tance, more and more &s;avage, or in a &s;tate of nature. In the &s;ame degree as the neighboring <HI>Gauls</HI> be|came acquainted with the arts, they communicated them to the neare&s;t <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> coloni&s;ts; who, derived from the &s;ame &s;tock, and retaining the &s;ame language and manners, were more capable and willing to receive any in&s;tructions offered by a congenerous peo|ple. For this rea&s;on <HI>Cantium,</HI> the modern <HI>Kent,</HI> and probably the country for &s;ome way up the <HI>Thames,</HI> was, as <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> informs us, far the mo&s;t civilized of any part of <HI>Britain:</HI> and that the inha|bitants differed very little in their manner of life from the <HI>Gauls.</HI> It was from the merchants who frequented our ports, he received the fir&s;t intelligence of the nature of our country, which induced him to undertake the inva&s;ion of <HI>Britain,</HI> and which in after|times layed the foundation of its conque&s;t by the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is not the le&s;t rea&s;on to doubt but that <HI>London</HI> exi&s;ted at that period, and was a place of much re&s;ort.<NOTE PLACE="marg">LONDON.</NOTE> It &s;tood in &s;uch a &s;ituation as the <HI>Britons</HI> would &s;elect, according to the rule they e&s;tabli&s;hed. An immen&s;e fore&s;t originally extended to the river &s;ide, and even as late as the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> II. covered the north|ern neighborhood of the city, and was filled with various &s;pecies of bea&s;ts of chace <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fitz&s;tephen's De&s;cr.

It was defended naturally by fo&s;&s;es; one formed by the creek which ran along <HI>Fleet-ditch,</HI> the other, afterwards known by that of <HI>Walbrook.</HI> The &s;outh &s;ide was

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">LONDON STONE.</NOTE>NEAR <HI>St. Swithin's</HI> church is a remnant of antiquity, which &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed to have been <HI>Briti&s;h;</HI> a &s;tone, which might have formed a part of a <HI>Druidical</HI> circle, or &s;ome other object of the antient religion, as it is placed near the center of the <HI>Ro|man</HI> precincts. Others have conjectured it to have been a milli|ary &s;tone, and to have &s;erved as a &s;tandard, from which they began to compute their miles. This &s;eems very rea&s;onable, as the di&s;|tances from the neighboring places coincide very exactly. At all times it has been pre&s;erved with great care, was placed deep in the ground, and &s;trongly fa&s;tened with bars of iron. It &s;eems pre&s;erved like the <HI>Palladium</HI> of the city. It is at pre&s;ent ca&s;ed like a relique, within free-&s;tone, with a hole left in the middle, which di&s;covers the original. Certainly &s;uper&s;titious re&s;pect had been payed to it; for when the notorious rebel <HI>Jack Cade</HI> pa&s;&s;ed by it, after he had forced his way into the city, he &s;truck his &s;word on <HI>London &s;tone,</HI> &s;aying, "Now is <HI>Mortimer</HI> lord of this citie <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Holin&s;hed,</HI> 634.</NOTE>;" as if that had been a cu&s;tomary ceremony of taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">WHEN FOUNDED.</NOTE>THERE is every rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that the <HI>Romans</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of <HI>London</HI> in the reign of <HI>Claudius;</HI> under whom <HI>Au|lus Plautius</HI> took <HI>Camalcdunum,</HI> the pre&s;ent <HI>Maldon,</HI> in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and planted there a colony, con&s;i&s;ting of veterans of the four|teenth legion, about a hundred and five years after the fir&s;t inva|&s;ion of our i&s;land by <HI>Cae&s;ar.</HI> This was the fir&s;t footing the <HI>Ro|mans</HI> had in <HI>Britain.</HI> It &s;eems certain that <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Verulam</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="13">
were taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of about the &s;ame time; but the la&s;t clames the honor of being of a far earlier date, more opulent, populous, and a royal &s;eat before the conque&s;t of <HI>Britain. Camalodunum</HI> was made a <HI>Colonia,</HI> or a place governed entirely by <HI>Roman</HI> laws and cu&s;toms; <HI>Verulamium,</HI> a <HI>Municipium,</HI> in which the natives were honored with the privileges of <HI>Roman</HI> citizens, and enjoyed their own laws and con&s;titutions; and <HI>Londinium,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ONLY A PRAEFECTURA.</NOTE> only a <HI>Praefec|tura,</HI> the inhabitants, a mixture of <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Britons,</HI> being &s;uffered to enjoy no more than the name of citizens of <HI>Rome,</HI> being governed by <HI>Praefects</HI> &s;ent annually from thence, without having either their own laws or magi&s;trates. It was even then of &s;uch concour&s;e, and &s;uch va&s;t trade, that the wi&s;e conquerors did not think fit to tru&s;t the inhabitants with the &s;ame privileges as other places, of which they had le&s;s rea&s;on to be jealous.</P>
<P>THERE is no mention of this important place, till the reign of <HI>Tiberius;</HI> when <HI>Tacitus</HI> &s;peaks of it as not having been di&s;tin|gui&s;hed as a colony, but famous for its great concour&s;e of mer|chants, and its va&s;t commerce: this indicates, at le&s;t, that <HI>London</HI> had been at that time of &s;ome antiquity as a trading town. The exports from hence were cattle, hides, and corn; dogs made a &s;mall article; and, let me add, that &s;laves were a con&s;iderable object. Our internal parts were on a level with the <HI>African</HI> &s;lave coa&s;ts; and wars among the petty monarchs were promoted for the &s;ake of a traffic now &s;o &s;trongly controverted <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Strabo,</HI> lib. iv. p. 265.</NOTE>. The imports were at fir&s;t &s;alt, earthen ware, and works in bra&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">IMPORTS.</NOTE> poli&s;hed bits of bones emulating ivory, hor&s;e-collars, toys of am|ber, and gla&s;&s;es, and other articles of the &s;ame material <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The &s;ame, p. 307.</NOTE>.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">WHEN FIRST MENTIONED.</NOTE>THE fir&s;t mention of <HI>London</HI> was occa&s;ioned by a calamity, in the year 61, in the reign of <HI>Nero,</HI> which nearly occa&s;ioned the extinction of the <HI>Roman</HI> power in <HI>Britain.</HI> The heroine <HI>Bo|adicia,</HI> indignant at the per&s;onal in&s;ult offered to her and her family, and the cruelties of the conquerors to the unhappy <HI>Bri|tons,</HI> made a &s;udden revolt, and de&s;troyed <HI>Camolodunum,</HI> after putting all the coloni&s;ts to the &s;word. <HI>Tacitus</HI> gives us the pre|diction of the ruin of that city, with all the maje&s;ty of hi&s;torical &s;uper&s;tition.

<P>LONDON certainly could not have been in the very low con|dition which &s;ome writers repre&s;ent it to have been, at the time of the Conque&s;t.

I rather concur with them who think that the mu&s;ter mu&s;t have been of the militia of the neighboring counties, and <HI>London</HI> the place of rendezvous. A writer <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Peter de Blois,</HI> archdeacon of <HI>London.</HI> See <HI>Fitz&s;tephen,</HI> p. 28, in the note.</NOTE> of that period, and at the very time re&s;ident in the capital, with

<P>IN the next reign was added the office of mayor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHANGED TO A MAYOR.</NOTE> a title bor|rowed from the <HI>Norman Maire,</HI> as well as the office. <HI>Henry Fitz-alwyn</HI> was the fir&s;t elected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o that tru&s;t. He had been be|fore mayor, but only by the nomination of his prince.</P>
<P>IN the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> III. after the citizens had &s;uffered many oppre&s;&s;ions, he re&s;tored a form of government, and appointed twenty-four citizens to &s;hare the power. In his &s;on's reign, we find the city divided into twenty-four wards; the &s;upreme ma|gi&s;trate of which was named <HI>Alderman,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ALDERMEN.</NOTE> an exceeding antient <HI>Saxon</HI> title. <HI>Aelder-man,</HI> a man advanced in years, and accordingly &s;uppo&s;ed to be of &s;uperior wi&s;dom and gravity.

<P>THE choice of the &s;ituation of this great city was mo&s;t judi|cious. It is on a gravelly &s;oil; and on a declivity down to the borders of a magnificent river. The &s;lope is evident in every part of the antient city, and the va&s;t modern buildings. The antient city was defended in front by the river; on the we&s;t &s;ide by the deep ravine, &s;ince known by the name of <HI>Fleet-ditch;</HI> on the north by mora&s;&s;es; on the ea&s;t, as I &s;u&s;pect, by another ra|vine. All the land round <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey</HI> was a flat &s;en, which continued beyond <HI>Fulham:</HI> but a ri&s;e commences oppo&s;ite to it, and forms a magnificent bend above the curvature of the <HI>Thames,</HI> even to the <HI>Tower.</HI> The <HI>Surry</HI> &s;ide was in all probability a great expan&s;e of water, a lake, a <HI>Llyn,</HI> as the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> call it; which an ingenious countryman of mine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>William Owen,</HI> of <HI>Barmouth,</HI> now re&s;ident in <HI>London.</HI></NOTE>, not without rea&s;on, thinks might have given a name to our capital; <HI>Llyn Din,</HI> or the city on the lake. This mo&s;t probably was the original name: and that de|rived from <HI>Llong</HI> a &s;hip, and <HI>Din</HI> a town, might have been be|&s;towed when the place became a &s;eat of trade, and famous for the concour&s;e of &s;hipping. The expan&s;e of water might have filled the &s;pace between the ri&s;ing grounds at <HI>Deptfor</HI> and tho&s;e at <HI>Clapham;</HI> and been bounded to the &s;outh by the beautiful <HI>Surry Hills. Lambeth Mar&s;h,</HI> and the <HI>Bank Side,</HI> evidently were reco|vered from the water. Along <HI>Lambeth</HI> are the names of <HI>Narrow

Walls,</HI> or the mounds which &s;erved for that purpo&s;e; and in <HI>South-wark, Bank&s;ide</HI> again &s;hews the means of converting the antient lake into u&s;eful land: even to this day the tract beyond <HI>South-wark,</HI> and in particular that beyond <HI>Bermond&s;ey &s;treet,</HI> is &s;o very low, and beneath the level of common tides, that the proprietors are obliged to &s;ecure it by embankments.</P>
<P>I BEGIN my account by cro&s;&s;ing over the <HI>Thames</HI> into <HI>Surry,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SURRY.</NOTE> which, with <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> formed the country of the antient <HI>Regni,</HI> being part of this i&s;land to which the <HI>Romans</HI> permitted a kingly govern|ment, merely to enjoy the in&s;olent boa&s;t of having kings as their &s;laves. The <HI>Saxons</HI> be&s;towed on this part their own names of <HI>Suthry</HI> or <HI>Suthrea,</HI> from its &s;ituation on the &s;outhern part of the river. I proceed to my accu&s;tomed walk of LAMBETH.<NOTE PLACE="marg">LAMBETH.</NOTE> In the earlier times it was a manor, po&s;&s;ibly a royal one, for the great <HI>Hardiknut</HI> died here in 1042, in the mid&s;t of the jollity of a wed|ding dinner: and here, without any formality, the u&s;urper <HI>Harold</HI> is &s;aid to have &s;natched the crown, and placed it on his own head.

No pious zeal re&s;tored the place, but the madne&s;s of prie&s;tly pride. <HI>Boniface,</HI> a wrathful and turbulent primate, elected in 1244, took it into his head to become a vi&s;itor of the priory of <HI>St. Bartholomew,</HI> to which he had no right. The monks met him with reverential re&s;pect, but a&s;&s;ured him the office did not belong to the bi&s;hop. The meek prelate ru&s;hed on the &s;ub-prior, knocked him down,
<PB N="19" REF="31">
kicked, beat, and buffeted him, tore the cope off his back, and &s;tamped on it like one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, while his attendants payed the &s;ame compliments to all the poor monks. The people, enraged at his unprie&s;tly conduct, would have torn him to pieces; when he retired to <HI>Lambeth,</HI> and, by way of expiation, rebuilt it with great magnificence.</P>
<P>THIS palace was very highly improved by the munificent <HI>Henry Chichely,</HI> who enjoyed the primacy from 1414 to 1443. I lament to find &s;o worthy a man to have been the founder of a building &s;o reproachful to his memory as the <HI>Lollards</HI> tower, at the expence of near two hundred and eighty pounds. Neither prote&s;tants or catholics &s;hould omit vi&s;iting this tower, the cruel pri&s;on of the unhappy followers of <HI>Wickliffe.</HI> The va&s;t &s;taples and rings, to which they were chained before they were brought to the &s;take, ought to make prote&s;tants ble&s;s the hour which freed them from &s;o bloody a religion. Catholics may glory, that time has &s;oftened their zeal into charity for all &s;ects, and made them blu&s;h at the&s;e memorials of the mi&s;guided zeal of our an|ce&s;tors.</P>
<P>THIS palace &s;uffered greatly in the civil wars. After tho&s;e of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> it was re&s;tored by archbi&s;hop <HI>Morton.</HI> He al&s;o built the gateway; in the lower room of which are &s;till to be &s;een the rings to which the overflowings of the <HI>Lollards</HI> tower were chained.</P>
<P>AFTER the civil wars of the la&s;t century,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FANATICAL FURY.</NOTE> when fanatical was united with political fury, it was found that every building de|voted to piety, had &s;uffered more than they had done in all the rage of family conte&s;t. The fine works of art, and the &s;acred memorials of the dead, were, except in a few ca&s;es, &s;acrificed to
<PB N="20" REF="32">
puritanical barbari&s;m, or to &s;acrilegious plunder. <HI>Lambeth</HI> tell to the &s;hare of the mi&s;creant regicide <HI>Scot.</HI> He turned the chapel into a hall, and levelled, for that purpo&s;e, the fine monument of archbi&s;hop <HI>Parker:</HI> he pulled down the noble hall, the work of <HI>Chichely,</HI> and &s;old the materials for his own profit. <HI>Juxon,</HI> on the Re&s;toration, found the palace of his predece&s;&s;ors a heap of ruins. His piety rebuilt a greater part than could have been expected from the &s;hort time he enjoyed the primacy. He rebuilt the great hall on the antient model, when the archbi&s;hop with his particu|lar friends &s;at at the high table: the &s;teward with the &s;ervants, who were gentry of the better rank, &s;at at the table on the right hand &s;ide: the almoner, the clergy, and others, occupied the table on the left. None but nobility or privy coun&s;ellors were admitted to the table of the archbi&s;hop. The bi&s;hops them&s;elves &s;at at the almoner's; the other gue&s;ts at the &s;teward's. All the meat which was not con&s;umed, was regularly given to the idle poor, who waited in crowds at the gate. It is not the defect of charity in modern prelates that this cu&s;tom is difu&s;ed; but the happy change in the times. Every one mu&s;t now eat the bread of his own indu&s;try; a much more certain &s;upport than the ca&s;ual bounty of the great; which misfortunes often prevented, and left the object a prey to mi&s;ery and famine. What is &s;tyled the luxury of the times, has by no means &s;uper&s;eded deeds of alms. Wealth is more equally diffu&s;ed; but charity is equally great: it pa&s;&s;es now through many channels, and makes le&s;s noi&s;e than when it was poured through fewer &s;treams.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">LIBRARY.</NOTE>THE fine library in this palace was founded by archbi&s;hop <HI>Bancroft;</HI> who died in 1610, and left all his books to his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, for ever. The &s;ucceeding archbi&s;hop, <HI>Abbot,</HI> bequeathed all his

<P>ON the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of epi&s;copacy, this valuable library was pre&s;erved by the addre&s;s of the celebrated Mr. <HI>Selden.</HI> It &s;eems that archbi&s;hop <HI>Bancroft</HI> had left his books to his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, on condition that the immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;or was to give bond that they &s;hould not be embezzled; but delivered entire from one to the other for ever. On failure of this article, they were to go to <HI>Chel&s;ea College,</HI> in ca&s;e it was built in &s;ix years after his decea&s;e. The college never was fini&s;hed: but whether any of <HI>Bancroft</HI>'s &s;ucce&s;&s;ors gave the &s;ecurity does not appear. The books were remaining at <HI>Lambeth</HI> in 1646, two years after the execution of archbi&s;hop <HI>Laud;</HI> when probably fearing for their &s;afety in times &s;o inimical to learning, Mr. <HI>Selden</HI> &s;ugge&s;ted to the univer|&s;ity of <HI>Cambridge</HI> their right to the books; and the whole were delivered into their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. On the Re&s;toration, archbi&s;hop <HI>Juxon</HI> demanded the return of the library; which was repeated by his &s;ucce&s;&s;or <HI>Sheldon,</HI> as founded on the will of the pious foun|der: and they were re&s;tored accordingly. Archbi&s;hop <HI>Sheldon</HI> added a con&s;iderable number: and archbi&s;hop <HI>Teni&s;on</HI> augmented it with part of his books.</P>
<P>THAT very worthy prelate archbi&s;hop <HI>Secker,</HI> be&s;ides a con&s;i|derable &s;um expended on making catalogues to the old regi&s;ters of the &s;ee, left to the library all &s;uch books from his own, as were not in the former, which comprehended much the large&s;t and mo&s;t valuable part of his own collection.</P>
<P>ARCHBISHOP <HI>Cornwallis</HI> be&s;towed many valuable books in his life-time. And the pre&s;ent archbi&s;hop has given a con&s;iderable &s;um for fitting up a proper repo&s;itory for the valuable collec|tion

<Q>He brought from thence certain workmen, and rich por|phery &s;tones, whereof hee made that curious, &s;ingular, rare pavement before the high altar; and with the&s;e &s;tones and workmen he did al&s;o frame the &s;hrine of <HI>Edward</HI> the Con|fe&s;&s;or <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Funeral Monuments, 485.</NOTE>.</Q>
This beautiful memorial con&s;i&s;ts of three rows of arches; the lower pointed: the upper round. And on each &s;ide of the lower is a mo&s;t elegant twi&s;ted pillar, an ornament the arti&s;t &s;eems peculiarly fond of.

<P>ON the di&s;&s;olution, this great mona&s;tery, the &s;econd mitred abby in the kingdom, underwent the common lot of the religious hou&s;es. In 1534, the abbot, <HI>William Ben&s;on,</HI> &s;ub&s;cribed to the king's &s;upremacy, and in 1539 &s;urrendered his mona&s;tery into the royal hands, and received as a reward the office of fir&s;t dean to the new foundation, con&s;i&s;ting of a dean and twelve preben|daries. He al&s;o erected it into a bi&s;hoprick, but its only bi|&s;hop was <HI>Thomas Thirleby;</HI> it being &s;uppre&s;&s;ed in 1550, on his tran&s;lation to <HI>Norwich.</HI> When the protector <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> ruled in the fulne&s;s of power, this magnificent, this &s;acred pile narrowly e&s;caped a total demolition. It was his de&s;ign to have pulled it down to the ground, and to have applied the materials towards the palace he was then erecting in the <HI>Strand,</HI> known by the name of <HI>Somer&s;et</HI>-hou&s;e. He was diverted from his de&s;ign by a bribe of not fewer than fourteen manors.&mdash; Mortals &s;hould be very de|licate in pronouncing the vengeance of Heaven on their fellow-creatures: yet, in this in&s;tance, without pre&s;umption, without &s;u|per&s;tition, one may &s;uppo&s;e his fall to have been marked out by the Almighty, as a warning to impious men. He fell on the &s;caffold on <HI>Tower-hill,</HI> lamented only becau&s;e his overthrow was effected by a man more wicked, more ambitious, and more dete&s;ted than him&s;elf. In their ends there was a con&s;ent of ju&s;tice: both died by the ax: and both of their headle&s;s bodies were flung, within a very &s;hort &s;pace, into the &s;ame place, among the attainted herd.</P>
<P>IN the reign of queen <HI>Mary,</HI> the former religion of the place experienced a brief re&s;toration. She with great zeal re&s;tored it
<PB N="78" REF="90">
to the antient conventual &s;tate; collected many of the rich habits and in&s;ignia of that &s;plendid wor&s;hip; e&s;tabli&s;hed fourteen monks, and appointed for their abbot <HI>John Feckenham,</HI> a man of great piety and learning, who, on his expul&s;ion in the &s;ucceeding reign, fini&s;hed his days in ea&s;y cu&s;tody in <HI>Wi&s;bech</HI> ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>IN 1560 it was changed into a collegiate church, con&s;i&s;ting of a dean and twelve &s;ecular canons, and thirty petty canons, and other members, two &s;chool-ma&s;ters, and forty king's or queen's &s;cholars, twelve alm&s;men, and many officers and &s;ervants <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tanner.</NOTE>. But there &s;eems to have been a &s;chool there from the fir&s;t foundation of the abby. <HI>Ingulphus,</HI> abbot of <HI>Crowland,</HI> &s;peaks of his having been educated at it; and of the di&s;putations he had with the queen of the <HI>Confe&s;&s;or,</HI> and of the pre&s;ents &s;he made him in money in his boyi&s;h days <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Quoted by <HI>Stow,</HI> book 1. vol. i. 123.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CLOISTERS, AND CHAPTER-HOUSE.</NOTE>BESIDES the church, many of the antient parts remain. The cloi&s;ters are entire, and filled with monuments. The north and we&s;t cloi&s;ters were built by abbot <HI>Littlington,</HI> who died in 1386: he al&s;o built the granary, which was afterwards the dormitory of the king's &s;cholars; of later years rebuilt.</P>
<P>THE entrance into the chapter-hou&s;e (built in 1250) is on one &s;ide of the cloi&s;ter, through a mo&s;t rich and magnificent gothic portal, the mouldings mo&s;t exqui&s;itely carved: this is divided into two gothic doors. After a de&s;cent of &s;everal &s;teps, is the chap|ter-hou&s;e, an octagon, each &s;ide of which had mo&s;t &s;uperb and lofty windows, now filled up, and lighted by le&s;&s;er. The opening into this room is as noble as that from the cloi&s;ter. The &s;tone

roof is de&s;troyed, and one of plank is &s;ub&s;tituted. The central pillar remains, light, &s;lender, and elegant, &s;urrounded by eight others; bound by two equidi&s;tant <HI>fa&s;ciae,</HI> and terminated in capi|tals of beautiful &s;implicity. By con&s;ent of the abbot, in 1377, the commons of <HI>Great Britain</HI> fir&s;t held their parlements in his place; the crown undertaking the repairs. Here they &s;at till the year 1547, when <HI>Edward</HI> VI. granted the chapel of <HI>St. Stephen</HI> for that purpo&s;e. It is at pre&s;ent filled with the public records, among which is the original <HI>Dome&s;day</HI> book, now above &s;even hundred years old: it is in as fine pre&s;ervation as if it was the work of ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>BENEATH the chapter-hou&s;e is a very &s;ingular crypt. The roof, which forms the floor of the former, is &s;upported by a &s;hort round pillar, quite hollow. The top &s;preads into ma&s;&s;y plain ribs, the &s;upports of the roof. The walls are not le&s;s than eighteen feet thick, and form a mo&s;t firm ba&s;e to the &s;uper&s;tructure. They had been pierced with &s;everal &s;mall windows, which are now lo&s;t by the va&s;t increa&s;e of earth on the out&s;ide <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This crypt is only acce&s;&s;ible through the hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Barrow.</HI></NOTE>; one is ju&s;t vi&s;ible in the garden belonging to Mr. <HI>Barrow.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> chamber was part of the abbot's lodgings; and built by <HI>Littlington.</HI> It is noted for having been the place where <HI>Henry</HI> IV. breathed his la&s;t: he had been &s;eized with a &s;woon while he was paying before the &s;hrine of <HI>St. Edward;</HI> and, being carried into this room, a&s;ked, on recovering, where he was? being informed, he an&s;wered, (I will &s;peak his reply in the words of <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> borrowed from hi&s;tory)

Silly enough! but the other beauties of the piece might &s;urely have moved the reverend zealot to mercy. The figures are numerous, and finely done.

In antient times it was cu&s;tomary to pre&s;ent to malefactors, on their way to the gallows (which, about the year 1413, was removed from <HI>Smithfield,</HI> and placed between <HI>St. Giles</HI>'s <HI>High-&s;treet,</HI> and <HI>Hog-lane</HI>) a great bowl of ale, as the la&s;t refre&s;hment they were to receive in this life <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Newcourt,</HI> i. 611.</NOTE>.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE>THIS church was rebuilt in 1625.

The fir&s;t &s;tone was laid in 1730; it was fini&s;hed in 1734, at the expence of ten thou&s;and pounds, in a manner which does great credit to its architect, Mr. <HI>Henry Flitcraft.</HI></P>
<P>IN the church-yard I have ob&s;erved with horror a great &s;quare pit, with many rows of coffins piled one upon the other, all ex|po&s;ed to &s;ight and &s;mell.

<P>NO one ought to be ignorant that this un&s;peakable benefit is owing to a WELSHMAN! Sir HUGH MIDDELTON, of <HI>Denbigh;</HI> who, on <HI>September</HI> 20th, 1608, began, and on <HI>September</HI> 29th, 1613, completed the great work. He brought the water from <HI>Amwell,</HI> in <HI>Hertford&s;hire,</HI> a di&s;tance of twenty, but, from the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of making a <HI>detour</HI> to avoid hills and vallies, it was increa&s;|ed to thirty-eight miles three-quarters and &s;ixteen poles. Yet it was impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;cape difficulties. His daring &s;pirit penetrated the hills in &s;everal places: and carried the river over two vallies. Over one it extended &s;ix hundred and &s;ixty feet in length, and thirty in height; and over another, four hundred and &s;ixty-two feet in length. The original &s;ource of this river was, by the va&s;t increa&s;e of <HI>London,</HI> found inadequate to its wants. The New River company found it nece&s;&s;ary to have recour&s;e to another &s;upply. They applied to parlement for powers to obtain it from the river <HI>Lee,</HI> the property of the city. <HI>London</HI> oppo&s;ed the bene|fit intended its inhabitants; but in vain, parlement wi&s;ely deter|mined again&s;t their objections: &s;o the ble&s;&s;ing was forced upon them! and the river <HI>Lee</HI> &s;upplies the greater part of the wants of the city. Sir HUGH MIDDELTON was ruined by the execution of his project. So little was the benefit under&s;tood, that, for above thirty years, the &s;eventy-two &s;hares, it was divided into, &s;hared only five pounds apiece. Each of the&s;e &s;hares was &s;old originally for a hundred pounds. Within this twelvemonth they were &s;old at nine thou&s;and pounds a &s;hare; and lately at ten thou|&s;and: and are increa&s;ing, becau&s;e their profits increa&s;e, on which their dividends are grounded.

<P>BY this charter, barbers were not to practi&s;e &s;urgery, farther than drawing of teeth: and &s;urgeons were &s;trictly prohibited from

the feat or craft of barbery, or &s;having. U&s;e was to make both perfect. But by the year 1745, it having been di&s;covered, that the above arts were foreign to, and independent of each other, the barbers and the &s;urgeons were, by act of parlement, &s;epa|rated, and made di&s;tinct corporations. It was very fit that an a&s;&s;o|ciation, which was now become ludicrous, &s;hould be di&s;&s;olved: our &s;urgeons began at that period to ri&s;e into great fame. True it is, that pupils then went to <HI>Paris</HI> to improve in the art: at pre|&s;ent, <HI>Europe</HI> looks up to our &s;urgeons as on the &s;ummit of the profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>IT will be curious to turn back from the&s;e times to tho&s;e of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. to compare the &s;tate of &s;urgery: when at one time there were very few, as <HI>Gale</HI> tells us, worthy to be called &s;urgeons. His account of tho&s;e employed in the army is very humorous. "I remember," &s;ays he,
<Q>when I was in the wars at <HI>Muttrel (Montreuil)</HI> in the time of that mo&s;t famous prince king <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. there was a great rabblement, that took on them to be &s;urgeons: &s;ome were &s;ow-gelders, and &s;ome hor&s;e-gelders, with tinkers, and coblers. This noble &s;ect did &s;uch great cures, that they got them&s;elves a perpetual name; for, like as <HI>The&s;&s;alus</HI>'s &s;ect were called <HI>The&s;&s;alions,</HI> &s;o was this noble rabblement, for their notorious cures, called <HI>Dog-leaches;</HI> for in two dre&s;&s;ings they did commonly make their cures whole and found for ever; &s;o that they neither felt heat nor cold, nor no manner of pain after. But when the duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> who was then general, under&s;tood how the people did die, and that of &s;mall wounds, he &s;ent for me, and certain other &s;urgeons, commanding us to make &s;earch how the&s;e men came to their death; whether it were by the grievou&s;ne&s;s of their wounds, or by the lack of knowledge of the &s;urgeons; and we, according
<PB N="230" REF="255">
to our commandment, made &s;earch through all the camp; and found many of the &s;ame good fellows, which took upon them the names of &s;urgeons; not only the names, but the wages al&s;o. We a&s;king of them whether they were &s;urgeons or no, they &s;aid they were; we demanded with whom they were brought up, and they, with &s;hamele&s;s faces, would an&s;wer, either with one cunning man, or another, which was dead. Then we de|manded of them what chirurgery &s;tuff they had to cure men withal; and they would &s;hew us a pot, or a box, which they had in a budget; wherein was &s;uch trumpery as they did u&s;e to grea&s;e hor&s;es heels withal, and laid upon &s;cabbed hor&s;es backs, with rewal, and &s;uch like. And others, that were cob|lers and tinkers, they u&s;ed &s;hoe-maker's wax, with the ru&s;t of old pans, and made therewithal a noble &s;alve, as they did term it. But in the end, this worthy rabblement was committed to the <HI>Mar&s;hal&s;ea,</HI> and threatened, by the duke's grace, to be hanged for their worthy deeds, except they would declare the truth what they were, and of what occupations; and in the end they did confe&s;s, as I have declared to you before <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Atkin</HI>'s Memoirs of Medicine, p. 99.</NOTE>.</Q>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">TALBOT EDWARDS, KEEPER OF THE KING'S REGALIA.</NOTE>I PASS over le&s;s intere&s;ting monuments, to the little &s;tone on the floor, which records, that
<Q><HI>Talbot Edwards,</HI> late keeper of his maje&s;ty's <HI>regalia,</HI> 30th <HI>September,</HI> 1674, aged 80,</Q>
was de|po&s;ited here. Was it not a &s;hamele&s;s reign, no remembrance of this good and faithful &s;ervant would have been &s;uffered to remain. This venerable man was keeper of the <HI>regalia,</HI> when the ru&s;&s;ian <HI>Blood</HI> made the notorious attempt on the crown, and other orna|ments of maje&s;ty. Never was a more determined villain:
<Q>with a head to contrive, and heart to execute any wickedne&s;s.</Q>
<HI>Blood</HI> contrived, under the gui&s;e of a clergyman, to make acquaint|ance with Mr. <HI>Edwards;</HI> in&s;inuated him&s;elf into his favor and confidence. After various vi&s;its, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;everal other a&s;&s;ociates, he &s;eized on the old man, whom he had reque&s;ted to &s;hew the jewels to his friends, gagged him, and on his re&s;i&s;ting, &s;truck him on the head with a mallet, and gave him &s;everal &s;tabs. <HI>Edwards</HI> thought it prudent to counterfeit death. <HI>Blood</HI> put the crown under his par&s;on's gown: another put the globe in his breeches: a third, not being able to conceal the &s;ceptre by rea&s;on of its length, broke off the rich ruby and put it in his pocket. As &s;oon as they were gone, <HI>Edwards</HI> forced out the gag, and gave the alarm; they were in&s;tantly pur&s;ued, and three of them
<PB N="267" REF="292">
&s;oon taken. <HI>Blood</HI> &s;truggled hard for his prize, &s;aying, when it was wre&s;ted from him, <HI>It was a gallant attempt, though un&s;ucce&s;&s;|ful; it was for a</HI> CROWN.</P>
<P>THE curio&s;ity of the king was excited to &s;ee a man engaged in &s;o many important villanies: under pretence of obtaining di&s;cove|ries, his maje&s;ty made the wretch a vi&s;it; from that moment the artful <HI>Blood</HI> dated his &s;ecurity: he told the king &s;o many plau&s;ible tales; &s;uch indifference he &s;hewed for his own life, &s;uch anxiety for that of his maje&s;ty (for he in&s;inuated that his comrades would certainly revenge his death, even on his &s;acred maje&s;ty) that in a &s;hort time he obtained his pardon. It was nece&s;&s;ary to apply to the duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> for permi&s;&s;ion, the ruffian having made the attempt on his grace's life not long before. The duke nobly an|&s;wered,
<Q>If his maje&s;ty could forgive him &s;tealing the crown, he might ea&s;ily forgive the attempt upon his life; and if &s;uch was his maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure, that was a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for him, and his lord&s;hip (the earl of <HI>Arlington,</HI> who brought the me&s;&s;age) might &s;pare the re&s;t.</Q>
<HI>Blood</HI> was not only pardoned, but re|ceived into favor, had a pen&s;ion of five hundred a year, and was perpetually &s;een at court, enjoying the &s;miles of maje&s;ty, and even &s;ucce&s;sfully employing his intere&s;t, as a mo&s;t re&s;pectable patron. But all good men looked on him with horror, and con|&s;idered him as a <HI>Sicarius</HI> to a profligate &s;et of men, to overawe any who had integrity enough to re&s;i&s;t the mea&s;ures of a mo&s;t profligate court. This mi&s;creant died peacefully in his bed, <HI>Au|gu&s;t</HI> 29th, 1680, fearle&s;sly, and without any &s;igns of penitence; totally hardened and for&s;aken by Heaven.</P>

Even the exi&s;tence of a religious hou&s;e before the Conque&s;t has been &s;u&s;pected: but the <HI>Dome&s;day</HI> book puts that out of doubt, by informing us, <HI>Ip&s;e epi&s;copus habet unum mona&s;terium in Sudwerche.</HI> Numbers of u&s;eful, as well as pious works, in early days, originated from the in&s;tigation of the church|men, who often had the honor of being called the founders, when the work it&s;elf was performed by their devotees. Neither is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed that they could keep it in repair: the &s;ame zeal which impelled people to contribute to the building, operated in the ve&s;titure of land for its future &s;upport; and this appears to have been done by &s;everal in&s;tances; yet the endowments were &s;o &s;mall, that a &s;upplementary tax was often rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>IN 1136, the bridge was burnt down. By the year 1163 it grew &s;o ruinous as to occa&s;ion its being rebuilt, under the care of one <HI>Peter,</HI> curate of <HI>St. Mary Colechurch,</HI> a celebrated architect of tho&s;e times.

It proved a work of thirty-three years: the architect died four years before it was completed; and another clergyman, <HI>I&s;en|bert,</HI> ma&s;ter of the &s;chools of <HI>Xainctes,</HI> was recommended to the citizens, by king <HI>John,</HI> for the honor of fini&s;hing it; but they
<PB N="296" REF="321">
rejected their prince's choice, and committed the work to three merchants of <HI>London,</HI> who completed it in 1209. <HI>Peter</HI> was buried in a beautiful chapel, probably of his own con&s;truction, dedicated to <HI>St. Thomas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> IN ONE OF THE PIERE.</NOTE> which &s;tood on the ea&s;t &s;ide, in the ninth pier from the north end, and had an entrance from the river, as well as the &s;treet, by a winding &s;tairca&s;e. It was beautifully paved with black and white marble, and in the middle was a tomb, &s;up|po&s;ed to contain the remains of <HI>Peter</HI> the architect.</P>
<P>THIS great work was founded on enormous piles, driven as clo&s;ely as po&s;&s;ible together: on their tops were laid long planks ten inches thick, &s;trongly bolted; and on them were placed the ba&s;e of the pier, the lowermo&s;t &s;tones of which were bedded in pitch, to prevent the water from damaging the work: round all were the piles which are called the <HI>Sterlings,</HI> de&s;igned for the pre|&s;ervation of the foundation piles. The&s;e contracted the &s;pace between the piers &s;o greatly, as to occa&s;ion, at the retreat of every tide, a fall of five feet, or a number of temporary cataracts, which, &s;ince the foundation of the bridge, have occa&s;ioned the lo&s;s of many thou&s;and lives. The water, at &s;pring-tides, ri&s;es to the height of about eighteen feet. The length of this va&s;t work is nine hun|dred and fifteen feet, the exact breadth of the river. The num|ber of arches was nineteen, of unequal dimen&s;ions, and greatly deformed by the &s;terlings, and the hou&s;es on each &s;ide, which overhung and leaned in a mo&s;t terrific manner. In mo&s;t places they hid the arches, and nothing appeared but the rude piers. I well remember the &s;treet on <HI>London-bridge,</HI> narrow, dark&s;ome, and dangerous to pa&s;&s;engers from the multitude of carriages: frequent arches of &s;trong timber cro&s;&s;ed the &s;treet, from the tops of the hou&s;es, to keep them together, and from falling into the
<PB N="297" REF="322">
river. Nothing but u&s;e could pre&s;erve the re&s;t of the inmates, who &s;oon grew deaf to the noi&s;e of the falling waters, the clamors of watermen, or the frequent &s;hrieks of drowning wretches. Mo&s;t of the hou&s;es were tenanted by pin or needle makers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PIN-MAKERS.</NOTE> and oeco|nomical ladies were wont to drive from the <HI>St. James</HI>'s end of the town, to make cheap purcha&s;es. <HI>Fuller</HI> tells us, that <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> needles were made here fir&s;t in <HI>Cheap&s;ide,</HI> by a negro, who died without communicating the art. <HI>Elias Crow&s;e,</HI> a <HI>German,</HI> in the reign of <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> was more liberal, and fir&s;t taught the method to the <HI>Engli&s;h. Fuller</HI>'s definition of a needle is excellent, <HI>qua&s;i</HI> NE IDLE.</P>
<P>IN the bridge were three openings on each &s;ide, with ballu|&s;trades, to give pa&s;&s;engers a &s;ight of the water and &s;hipping. In one part had been a draw-bridge, u&s;eful either by way of defence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">DRAW-BRIDGE.</NOTE> or for the admi&s;&s;ion of &s;hips into the upper part of the river. This was protected by a &s;trong tower.

it was re&s;olved to borrow money of Sir <HI>John Cutler,</HI> to di&s;charge the college debt, but the &s;um is not &s;pecified.

<P>THE origin of the cu&s;tom of preaching at cro&s;&s;es, was proba|bly accidental.

<P>IT certainly at fir&s;t was a common cro&s;s, and coeval with the church. When it was fir&s;t covered, and converted into a pulpit-cro&s;s, we are not informed.

<P>WE hear of this being in u&s;e as early as the year 1259. It was u&s;ed not only for the in&s;truction of mankind, by the doctrine of the preacher, but for every purpo&s;e political or eccle&s;ia&s;tical: for

<P>IN digging the foundation for the rebuilding of this cathedral, it was di&s;covered, beneath the graves mentioned at p. 9, that the foundation of the old church re&s;ted on a layer of hard and clo&s;e pot earth. Curio&s;ity led Sir <HI>Chri&s;topher Wren</HI> to &s;earch farther.

&s;carcely four. On advancing farther, he met with nothing but loo&s;e &s;and; at length he came to water and &s;and mixed with periwinkles, and other &s;ea-&s;hells; and, by boring, came at la&s;t to the beach, and under that the natural hard clay: which evinced that the &s;ea had once occupied the &s;pace on which St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s now &s;tands.

Its <HI>gothic</HI> front terminates the end of <HI>King-&s;treet.</HI> Its length is a hundred and fifty-three feet; its breadth forty-eight; its height fifty-five; &s;o that it is capable of holding thou&s;ands of people.

<P><PB N="373" REF="399">WITHIN are portraits of numbers of our judges, who frequently try cau&s;es under this roof. I mu&s;t direct the reader's attention to twelve of that order of peculiar merit: the&s;e are the portraits of the able and virtuous Sir MATTHEW HALE, and his eleven cotemporary judges; who, after the dreadful calamity of 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">66, regulated the rebuilding of the city of <HI>London</HI> by &s;uch wi&s;e rules, as to prevent the endle&s;s train of vexatious law-&s;uits which might en&s;ue; and been little le&s;s chargeable than the fire it&s;elf had been. This was principally owing to Sir <HI>Matthew Hale,</HI> who con|ducted the bu&s;ine&s;s; and &s;at with his brethren in <HI>Clifford</HI>'s <HI>Inn,</HI> to compo&s;e all differences between landlord and tenant. The&s;e portraits were painted by <HI>Michael Wright,</HI> a good painter in the time of <HI>Charles</HI> II. and <HI>James</HI> II. and who died in the year 1700. It was de&s;igned that Sir <HI>Peter Lely</HI> &s;hould draw the&s;e pictures, but he fa&s;tidiou&s;ly refu&s;ed to wait on the judges at their cham|bers. <HI>Wright</HI> received &s;ixty pounds apiece for his work <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Anecdotes of Painting, iii. 40.</NOTE>. In the year 1779, they were found to be in &s;o bad a condition, as to make it an even que&s;tion with the committee of city lands, whe|ther they &s;hould be continued in their places, or committed to the flames. To the eternal honor of alderman <HI>Town&s;end,</HI> his vote decided in favor of their pre&s;ervation <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>London's Gratitude,</HI> &amp;c. 19.</NOTE>. He recommended Mr. <HI>Roma,</HI> (now unhappily &s;natched from us by death), who, by his great &s;kill in repairing pictures, re&s;cued them from the rage of time: &s;o that they may remain another century, a proof of the gratitude of our capital. The&s;e <HI>were</HI> proofs of a &s;en&s;e of real

merit: but in how many places do we meet in&s;tances of a tem|porary idolatry, the phrenzy of the day! Statues and portraits appear, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of po&s;terity, purged from the preju|dices of the time.</P>
<Q><L>The things them&s;elves are neither &s;carce nor rare;</L>
<L>The wonder's, how the devil they got there!</L></Q>
<P>FACING the entrance are two tremendous figures, by &s;ome named <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog;</HI> by <HI>Stow,</HI> an antient <HI>Briton</HI> and <HI>Saxon.</HI> I leave to others the important deci&s;ion. At the bottom of the room is a marble group, of good workman&s;hip, (with <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Commerce</HI> whimpering like two marred children), executed &s;oon after the year 1770, by Mr. BACON. The principal figure was al&s;o a giant, in his day, the raw-head and bloody-bones to the good folks at St. <HI>James</HI>'s; which, while remon|&s;trances were in fa&s;hion, annually haunted the court in terrific forms. The eloquence da&s;hed in the face of maje&s;ty, alas! proved in vain. The &s;pectre was there condemned to &s;ilence; but his patrioti&s;m may be read by his admiring fellow-citizens, as long as the melancholy marble can retain the tale of the affrighted times.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">GREAT FEASTS.</NOTE>THE fir&s;t time that this hall was u&s;ed on fe&s;tive occa&s;ions, was by Sir <HI>John Shaw,</HI> gold&s;mith, knighted in the field of <HI>Bo&s;worth.</HI> After building the e&s;&s;entials of good kitchens and other offices, in the year 1500 he gave here the mayor's fea&s;t, which before had u&s;ually been done in <HI>Grocers-hall.</HI> None of their bills of fare have reached me, but doubtle&s;sly they were very magnifi|cent. They at length grew to &s;uch exce&s;s, that, in the time of <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> a &s;umptuary law was made to re&s;train the ex|pence

both of provi&s;ions and liveries: but I &s;u&s;pect, as it le&s;&s;ened the honor of the city, it was not long ob&s;erved; for in 1554, the city thought proper to renew the order of council, by way of reminding their fellow-citizens of their relap&s;e into luxury. Among the great fea&s;ts given here on public occa&s;ions, may be reckoned that given in 1612, on occa&s;ion of the unhappy marriage of the prince <HI>Palatine</HI> with <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> daughter of <HI>James</HI> I; who, in defiance of the remon&s;trances of his better-judging father-in-law, ru&s;hed on the u&s;urpation of the domi|nion of another monarch, and brought great mi&s;ery on him&s;elf and his amiable &s;pou&s;e. The next was in 1641, when <HI>Charles</HI> I. returned from his imprudent, inefficacious journey into <HI>Scotland.</HI> In the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t factious and turbulent times, when every engine was &s;et to work to annihilate the regal power, the city, un|der its lord mayor, Sir <HI>William Acton,</HI> made a fea&s;t unparalleled in hi&s;tory for its magnificence. All external re&s;pect was payed to his maje&s;ty; the la&s;t he ever experienced in the inflamed city. Of the entertainment we know no more, than that it con&s;i&s;ted of five hundred di&s;hes. But of that which was given in our happier days, to his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty, in the mayoralty of Sir <HI>Samuel Flud|yer,</HI> the bill of fare is given us. This I print; and, as a parallel to it, that of another royal fea&s;t, given in 1487 at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> on oc|ca&s;ion of the coronation of <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> queen of <HI>Henry</HI> VII, whom he treats with characteri&s;tical oeconomy, notwith&s;tanding a king|dom was her dower <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The whole account is given in <HI>Maitland,</HI> i. 341 to 344.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THESE <HI>Sotelties,</HI> or Subtilities as they were called, were the ornamental part of the de&s;ert, and were extremely different from tho&s;e in pre&s;ent u&s;e. In the inthronization fea&s;t of archbi&s;hop <HI>Wareham,</HI> on <HI>March</HI> 9th, 1504, the fir&s;t cour&s;e was preceded by

<P>BEDFORD-ROW, in this neighborhood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BEDFORD-ROW.</NOTE> took its name from the u&s;es to which tho&s;e lands, and others adjacent, were be|queathed by Sir <HI>William Harpur,</HI> &s;on of <HI>William Harpur,</HI> of <HI>Bed|ford;</HI> viz. to found a free and perpetual &s;chool, in that his native place; for portioning poor maidens; for &s;upporting poor children; and for maintaining the poor with the &s;urplus; all of them inhabi|tants of the &s;aid town. Part of the lands were of his own inheri|tance; part belonging to the <HI>Chartreux,</HI> at that time lately di&s;&s;olved. Some of the lands were lo&s;t, others granted to Sir <HI>Thomas Fi&s;her,</HI> baronet, for other lands belonging to him; the remainder granted, in the year 1668, upon lea&s;e, by the corporation of <HI>Bedford,</HI> tru&s;tees to the charity, for the purpo&s;es of building, for the term of forty-one years, at the yearly rent of ninety-nine years: and in 1684, the rever&s;ion to <HI>Nicholas Barbon,</HI> D. D. for the further term of fifty-one years, at the rent of a hundred and fifty, on the expira|tion of the fir&s;t lea&s;e. <HI>Bedford-&s;treet, Bedford-row</HI> and <HI>court, Prin|ces-&s;treet, Theobald's-row, North-&s;treet, Ea&s;t-&s;treet, Lamb's-con|duit-&s;treet, Queen-&s;treet, Eagle-&s;treet, Bo&s;wel-court,</HI> and &s;everal other &s;treets, ro&s;e in con&s;equence, by which the rents were mo&s;t con&s;i|derably increa&s;ed. A &s;uit aro&s;e, about the year 1725, between the warden and fellows of <HI>New College,</HI> and the corporation of <HI>Bed|ford,</HI> concerning the right of appointing the ma&s;ters to the &s;chool, and their &s;alaries. The &s;ame was decided, in 1725, in favor of the college; and that the corporation was to pay the head ma&s;ter
<PB N="430" REF="458">
thirty pounds a year, and the u&s;her twenty; and the other chari|ties to be paid proportionably to the revenues of the e&s;tate.</P>
<P>ON the expiration of the two lea&s;es, in 1760, the annual reve|nues ari&s;ing from the rents were found to amount to &pound;. 2,336. 17 <HI>s.</HI> and the hou&s;es at will to &pound;. 273. And it was found that improve|ments might be made which would increa&s;e the revenue &s;o far as to make the whole amount to &pound;. 3,000 a year. In fact, in 1788, they did amount to &pound;. 2,917. 17 <HI>s.</HI></P>
<P>AMONG other regulations, in con&s;equence of the increa&s;ed revenue, by an act made about the year 1762, new hou&s;es were directed to be built for the &s;choolma&s;ter, u&s;her, and writing-ma&s;|ter. The head-ma&s;ter's &s;alary to be augmented to &pound;. 200 per ann.; the u&s;her's to &pound;. 100; the writing-ma&s;ter's to &pound;. 60. To|wards the portioning of the poor maidens &pound;. 800 was to be annu|ally given; &pound;. 600 to be annually given towards apprenticing poor children. And I might add &s;everal other particulars, which I omit, as not relative to the city, the &s;ubject of the&s;e &s;heets.</P>
