<LG>
<L>IN days, my Lord, when mother Time,</L>
<L>Tho' now grown old, was in her prime,</L>
<L>When SATURN fir&s;t began to rule,</L>
<L>And JOVE was hardly come from &s;chool,</L>
<L>How happy was a country life!</L>
<L>How free from wickedne&s;s and &s;trife!</L>
<L>Then each man liv'd upon his farm,</L>
<L>And thought and did no mortal harm;</L>
<L>On mo&s;&s;y banks fair virgins &s;lept,</L>
<L>As harmle&s;s as the flocks they kept;</L>
<L>Then love was all they had to do,</L>
<L>And nymphs were cha&s;te, and &s;wains were true.</L>

Virtue no more in rural plains,</L>
<L>Or innocence, or peace remains;</L>

<HEAD>MARRIAGE A-LA-MODE: OR, The TWO SPARROWS. A Fable.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From Mon&s;. DE LA MOTTE, Book IV. Fable 21.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>A Grove there was, by nature made,</L>
<L>Of trees that form'd a plea&s;ing &s;hade;</L>
<L>Where warbled, ever free from care,</L>
<L>The wing'd mu&s;icians of the air.</L>

<L>Two amorous Sparrows cho&s;e this place;</L>
<L>The &s;ofte&s;t of the feather'd race:</L>

<L>Le&s;s fam'd for &s;inging, than for love.</L>
<L>The &s;ong&s;ters warbled &s;weet; while they</L>

<L>So clo&s;ely &s;eated were the two,</L>

<L>The twig was &s;lender where they &s;ate,</L>
<L>And bent beneath their little weight;</L>

But &s;carcely in their lives was known</L>

<P>Ver&s;e 1, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The various and ridiculous preten&s;ions of mankind to Honour and Fame enumerated.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 21. Tho' they are thus incon&s;tant and contradic|tory, yet true Honour is a thing fixed and determinate.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 29. If we would form an impartial judgment of what is truly honourable, we mu&s;t ab&s;tract all con&s;ide|rations which regard our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 32. Not only &s;o, but we mu&s;t remove our&s;elves to a proper di&s;tance from the object we examine, le&s;t &s;ome part &s;hould predominate in our eye, and occa&s;ion a fal&s;e judgment of the whole.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 48. Therefore the &s;ure&s;t method is, to prove by pa&s;t examples what commands our love and e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 50, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Expence and grandeur cannot give true Honour: Their mo&s;t &s;plendid monuments vani&s;h; and even &s;hould they la&s;t for ever, could not be&s;tow real glory, if only the records of Pride, Tyranny and Vice.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 72, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Much le&s;s if purchas'd by Oppre&s;&s;ion and Guilt.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 86, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> True Honour is not to be reaped from un|ju&s;t Conque&s;t: It is not Victory, but a ju&s;t Cau&s;e that can engage our E&s;teem.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 116. Neither is true glory to be obtained by wit or &s;cience: They are chimerical: Sometimes attended with folly, and weakne&s;s; often &s;tained with vice, and &s;o render their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors mi&s;chievous and infamous.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 138. The foundation o&s; true Honour is Virtue only.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 153. It is Virtue only that gives the poet la&s;ting glory: this proved by in&s;tances.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 164. The Philo&s;opher can only hope for true glory from the &s;ame &s;ource; becau&s;e Truth is his object, and nothing can be Truth that tends to de&s;troy Virtue and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 174. Hence appears the madne&s;s, infamy, and fal&s;ehood of tho&s;e de&s;tructive &s;chemes &s;et on foot by the &s;ect called Free Thinkers.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 180. Fal&s;ehood &s;hort-lived: Truth eternal.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 184, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Examples of the two mo&s;t illu&s;trious phi|lo&s;ophers that ever adorned the world; the one excellent in moral, the other in natural knowledge.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 198, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Kings, &s;tate&s;men, and patriots mu&s;t build, their fame on virtue.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 204. Flattery cannot rai&s;e folly or vice into true glory.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 222. Thus it appears that every one has the power of obtaining true honour, by promoting the happine&s;s of mankind in his proper &s;tation.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 226. And thus the love of fame, tho' often per|verted to bad ends, is naturally conducive to virtue and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 230, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> True honour characteriz'd and exem|plify'd.</P>

<L>Before who&s;e altar virtue oft' hath bled,</L>
<L>And oft' a fated victim &s;hall be led:</L>
<L>Lo! <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><P>It were to be wi&s;hed that lord Shaft&s;bury had expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with greater preci&s;ion on this &s;ubject: however, thus much may be affirmed with truth.</P>
<P>1&s;t, By the general tenour of his e&s;&s;ays on Enthu&s;ia&s;m, and the Freedom of Wit and Humour, it appears that his principal de&s;ign was to recommend the way of Ridicule (as he calls it) for the inve&s;tigation of truth, and detec|tion of fal&s;hood, not only in moral but religious &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>2dly, It appears no le&s;s evident, that in the cour&s;e of his rea&s;onings on this que&s;tion, he confounds two things which are in their nature and con&s;equences entirely dif|ferent. They are, Ridicule and Good-humour: the latter acknowledged by all to be the be&s;t mediator in every debate; the former no le&s;s regarded by mo&s;t, as an Embroiler and Incendiary. Tho' he &s;ets out with a formal profe&s;&s;ion of proving the efficacy of wit, humour, and ridicule in the inve&s;tigation of truth, yet by &s;hifting and mixing his terms, he generally &s;lides in&s;en&s;ibly into mere encomiums on good|breeding, cheerfulne&s;s, urbanity, and free enquiry. This indeed keeps &s;omething like an argument on foot, and amu&s;es the &s;uperficial reader; but to a more ob&s;ervant eye di&s;co|vers a very contemptible defect either of &s;incerity or pene|tration.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion concerning Ridicule may be thus not impro|perly &s;tated: Whether doubtful propo&s;itions of any kind can be a&s;certained by the application of ridicule? Much might be &s;aid on this que&s;tion; but a few words will make the mat|ter clear to an unprejudic'd mind.</P>
<P>The di&s;approbation or contempt which certain objects rai&s;e in the mind of man, is a particular mode of pa&s;&s;ion: the objects of this pa&s;&s;ion are apparent fal&s;hood, incon|gruity, or impropriety of &s;ome particular kinds. Thus, the object of fear is apparent danger, or probable approach|ing ill. But who has ever dreamt of exalting the pa&s;&s;ion of fear into a &s;tandard or te&s;t of real danger? The de|&s;ign mu&s;t have been rejected as ab&s;urd, becau&s;e it is the work of rea&s;on only, to correct and fix the pa&s;&s;ion on its proper objects. The ca&s;e is parallel: apparent or &s;eem|ing fal&s;hoods, &amp;c. are the objects of contempt, but it is the work of rea&s;on only, to determine whether the &s;uppo&s;ed fal&s;hoods be real or fictitious. But it is &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"The &s;en&s;e of ridicule can never be mi&s;taken."</Q>&mdash;Why, no more can the &s;en&s;e of Danger.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"What, do men never fear without rea&s;on?"</Q>&mdash;Yes, very commonly; but they as often de&s;pi&s;e and laugh without rea&s;on. And thus, before any thing can be determined in either ca&s;e, rea&s;on, and rea&s;on only, mu&s;t examine circum&s;tances, &s;eperate ideas, decide upon, re&s;train, and correct the pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Hence it follows, that the way of ridicule is in fact no more than a &s;pecies of eloquence: It applies to a pa&s;&s;ion, and therefore can go no farther in the inve&s;tigation of truth, than any of tho&s;e arts which tend to rai&s;e love, pity, terror, rage or hatred in the heart of man. Con&s;equent|ly, his lord&s;hip might have tran&s;planted the whole &s;y&s;tem of rhetorick into his new &s;cheme, with the &s;ame propriety as he hath introduced the way of ridicule it&s;elf. A hope|ful project this, for the propagation of truth!</P>
<P>As this &s;eems to be the real nature and tendency of ridicule, it hath been generally di&s;couraged by philo&s;o|phers and divines, together with every other mode of elo|quence, when apply'd to controverted opinions. This di&s;|couragement, from what is &s;aid above, appears to have been rational and ju&s;t; therefore the charge laid again&s;t divines with regard to this affair by a zealous admirer of lord Shaft&s;bury (See a note on the Plea&s;ures of Imagination, Book III.) &s;eems entirely groundle&s;s. The di&s;tinction which the &s;ame author hath attempted with re&s;pect to the influence of ridicule, between &s;peculative and moral truths, &s;eems no better founded. It is certain that opinions are no le&s;s liable to ridicule than actions. And it is no le&s;s certain that the way of ridicule, cannot determine the pro|priety or impropriety of the one, more than the truth of the other; becau&s;e the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion of contempt is equally engaged in both ca&s;es, and therefore (as above) rea&s;on only can examine the circum&s;tances of the action or opinion, and thus fix the pa&s;&s;ion on its proper objects.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, this new de&s;ign of di&s;covering truth by the vague and un&s;teady light of ridicule, puts one in mind of the hone&s;t Iri&s;hman, who apply'd his candle to he &s;un-dial in order to &s;ee how the night went.</P></NOTE> Shaft&s;b'ry rears her high on rea&s;on's throne,</L>
