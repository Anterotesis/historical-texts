<HEAD>THE ADVENTURES OF WILL. RAMBLE, ESQ.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="15" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XV.</HEAD>
<P>RATTLE called on his friend Ramble, and took him with him to the Shake&s;peare; the mem|bers had a&s;&s;embled &s;ome time; they con&s;i&s;ted of a motley group of all cla&s;&s;es, all complexions, and all na|tions. The chair was filled with old Noi&s;y, a man of &s;ome con&s;e|quence
<PB N="4" REF="3">in the opinion of the &s;ociety, and more &s;o in his own; he was one, who had long been the bell-weather of the flock. A man, with a &s;ullen countenance, and hanging eye-brows, that prevented his eyes declaring the mi&s;chief brooding in his heart. He hated Kings and King's-men, but it was only becau&s;e he was not on the li&s;t him&s;elf. This man had been ha|ranguing the company for near an hour and an half, and had not done yet. He was, when Ramble entered, on the &s;ubject of republicani&s;m. <Q> Monarchy, (&s;aid he) could only be the invention of tyrants, who wi&s;hed to en&s;lave the people, and make them
<PB N="5" REF="4">&s;ub&s;ervient to their own purpo&s;es. If kings had no &s;uch wi&s;h, what were they? Idols, puppets, to who&s;e office was annexed a trouble&s;ome, and ridiculous&mdash;nay, I may call it, a <HI>bla&s;phemous</HI> ceremony, a&s;&s;uming that homage, that &s;hould be paid only to the Deity; an office to which the good &s;en&s;e of the people is &s;acrificed, and a million of their money yearly. Why are we, gentlemen, to work hard?&mdash;Why is the hone&s;t &s;hoe-ma|ker, the taylor, the button-maker, the turner, and a thou&s;and other re|&s;pectable trade&s;men, to deprive their wives and children of comfort and nece&s;&s;aries, to cloath, amu&s;e, and
<PB N="6" REF="5">pamper a gilded puppet? 'Tis true, I have no wife nor child, at lea&s;t &s;uch as I would call &s;o, but never|thele&s;s I feel for you all.&mdash;God knows my heart&mdash;I &s;peak not from private intere&s;t. Whether we have a king or no king, it is all the &s;ame to me. I have no money, that I care a fig for. What I win to day, I lo&s;e to-mor|row, and what I may lo&s;e to-morrow, I may win the day after. To a &s;ingle man, life's a lottery. He is the child of fortune. The world contributes to &s;upport me. One feeds me, another cloathes me, and if I cannot pay them, in ca&s;h, I will in breath. No man &s;hall &s;top may mouth. Words are the only things I have to give, and I will
<PB N="7" REF="6">never &s;pare them. If they choak my utterance above, I will pour them forth below. A f&mdash;t for them all. I care not who leaves me, or who keeps with me. I can <HI>&s;tand</HI> without &s;upport, a&s;k mother A&mdash;, &s;he'll vouch for me. I have no wife or children but you; it is for you, and you only, that I have &s;truggled through life, and for you I will &s;truggle, whil&s;t I have lungs and &s;pirits.&mdash;In &s;hort, gentlemen, you are always &s;ure of <HI>me.</HI> I am a republican all over; <HI>will oppo&s;e depoti&s;m,</HI> vi et armis, <HI>and fight for your intere&s;t,</HI> pe|dibu&s;que manibu&s;que.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Till I am in place;</HI> Mr. Pre&s;ident, I &s;hall nae
<PB N="8" REF="7">think that admini&s;tration con&s;ults its own intere&s;t; they ought to ha their freends aboot them,</Q> (&s;ays Saunders Macpher&s;on a brawny Scotch-man, who &s;at impatiently waiting for an opportunity of vent|ing his &s;arca&s;ms <Q>It would be happy for his maaje&s;ty, if au his freends were as muckle in his in|tere&s;t, as Saunders Macpher&s;on, who has travelled in his kirtle far o'er the Highlands, in defence of pre|rogative. An ye had any di&s;cern|ment, you would ken the ble&s;&s;ings of the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment. Be|fore our good Jamie &s;at on the throne of this country, ye were aw a parcel of raggamuffins, like the
<PB N="9" REF="8"><HI>Sans Culottes</HI> at Paris, running your heeds again&s;t each other, in &s;earch of a &s;curvey la&s;&s;ie, ye call leeberty, who has played you mo|nie a &s;hrewd trick. She &s;hewed you a bonny vi&s;age, to mack you in loov wi her, and then turned her ragged breech upon you. It was oor Jamie that taught you to be wee&s;e; he took the dirk out of your hands, that you might not cut your fingers, and let you ken that happine&s;s was in aw your reach. Has not he and his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors given &s;ic encouragement to trade and commerce, that you may, if you plea&s;e, indulge your luxuries, nay your very veeces?
<PB N="10" REF="9">Ha they not put you in the way to get &s;ic penty of pouns, that you may throw them awa and be nae the poorer? for what you lack in ca&s;h, you find in credit. There's yon bonny chield, Johnny Latitat, that will tell you the &s;ame; he will tell you that he has mair pouns, than he kens what to do wi. Where then, in the name of St. Andrew, is there cau&s;e of grum|bling? Why winna you be content? Money appears of &s;o little value, in the pre&s;ent, happy times, that each man &s;eems to ha mair of it than he wi&s;hes, or he winna part wi it &s;o reedily. We are aw &s;en&s;ible of the conde&s;cen&s;ion of oor
<PB N="11" REF="10">government&mdash;Are not the king's meeni&s;ters ready for a little of this &s;tuff, which is of nae value, and which we &s;eem to &s;et nae &s;tore by, to gee us permee&s;&s;ion to u&s;e oor aine jades, to employ our aine &s;er|vants, to breathe the fre&s;h air, and enjoy the leeght of the day? And that we may nae want a quantity of money to pay for &s;ic indulgencies, what can be maer con&s;iderate than to leemit our amu&s;ements, and keep us frae &s;pending our time idly? That gued hearted man Ja|mie, departed frae his aine fertile country to take up his re&s;idence in South Britain, where your fine&s;t pro|&s;pects, without a mountain, are nae
<PB N="12" REF="11">mair to be compared with the pro&s;pects of the North, than a la&s;&s;ie, with fine eyne and good complexion, but without and no&s;e in her face, is to ane who has every &s;triking feature. You may tell us that he was glad to get into the South, that he might ta&s;te your peaches and your nectarines, and your other fine fruits; but in gued troth, where would ha been &s;ic fruits, but for the gardeners of North Britain, who are as far prefera|ble to the fruits, as the creator is to the created. Every country has its boa&s;t, England may have a good cleemet for peaches and nectarines, it may excel in arts, as France
<PB N="13" REF="12">does in wine, Arabia in hor&s;es, and Spain in wool. But I declare by St. Andrew, no country can produce better men and women than Scot|land; they are oor &s;taple commodity; they are au men of learning, and we export a great number to en|rich other countries. Even Lon|don is the better for them, and you ought to be thankful, that our Jamie led the way. Had he been wee&s;e and &s;teed in his aine country, you would now ha been as &s;avage as your ance&s;tors, but he removed; him&s;el here, made London the capital of Scotland, and held his court at St. James's, which is lit|tle better than an ho&s;pital; when
<PB N="14" REF="13">he might have figured away with more &s;plendor and comfort in Holy|rood hou&s;e, in Edinburgh; &s;o that do ye ken mae&s;ter pre&s;ident, Jamie coming to London, brought au our nobeelity and gentry here too; and here they are &s;pending their e&s;tates among an ungrate|ful rabble. What would England ha been, but for the union?&mdash;She has grown wealthy; &s;he has acquired a million and a half of freends, that would otherwi&s;e ha been her enemies. She has ac|quired &s;ecurity. There is no door open now, by which the French can penetrate your country. They dare as &s;oon be d&mdash;n'd as attempt
<PB N="15" REF="14">to invade Scotland; &s;o that if you can but defend your own coa&s;ts, you may bid the de'el ki&s;s your weem. Yet, ye are au grumbling; ye are nae grateful nor contented, but ye want to pull down your monarch, and be|come as &s;avage as your forefathers. In guede troth, Mr. Pre&s;ident, we are under great obligation to gevern|ment, and ought <HI>to be very proud o&s; our king.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>That dunderhead,</HI> Mr. Chairman, that rails at all mea&s;ures, that do not accord with his inclina|tions,</Q> (&s;ays Neddy Turncoat, a &s;tout, tall man, who had once been of another way of thinking than when he ro&s;e up to &s;peak, and
<PB N="16" REF="15">who then took the part of oppo|&s;ition, becau&s;e he thought oppo&s;ition was on the eve of getting into place) <Q>That dunderhead, (&s;ays he) di&s;co|vers very little &s;agacity, and can have no retro&s;pect to the excellence of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution. He is a mere creature of his own fancy, and illumined only by the glare of a de|ceitful meteor, the <HI>ignis fatuus</HI> of a &s;hallow mind, that leads him into bottomle&s;s bogs, and over dreadful precipices. The man who lifts his hand again&s;t the pre&s;ent government, reminds me of the giant in Mother Goo&s;e's Tales, who, in the intem|perence of his wrath, tore up a va&s;t oak by the roots, and brandi&s;hed it
<PB N="17" REF="16">in his hand, crying, Fee, fau, fum, I &s;mell the blood of an Engli&s;hman! I am a plain man, Mr. Chairman, and love to u&s;e plain word; and; when I &s;peak of the con&s;titution of this country, I &s;peak the language of a plain citizen, not ver&s;ed in oratory, or bred in the &s;chool of rhetorick. When I &s;peak of the three e&s;tates of the realm, the King, the Lords, and the Common, I approach the Com|mons, with re&s;pect, the Lords with deference, and the King with awe. I con&s;ider each as a check upon the other, and each incapable of doing any harm; but, collectively, it is like the <HI>tria in uno,</HI> where the whole com|bined, is perfect; and where one
<PB N="18" REF="17">power cannot act, but in union with the other two. All mu&s;t be wrong, or each mu&s;t be right. Whoever, then, &s;hall gain&s;ay this trinity, is a bla&s;phemer of the &s;tate, an incendi|ary, a &s;editious fellow, running about with a torch in his hand, to &s;et fire to the con&s;titution. He is a &s;econd Guy Faux, attempting to blow up both hou&s;es of Parliament; a wretch, that covets only, as do that de&s;pe|rate a&s;&s;embly on the other &s;ide the water, to embrue his hands in his country's blood. And, after all, was the Genius of this i&s;le to withdraw its patronage, and exclude it from the orb of its influence; was a revolu|tion to take place, a &s;ubver&s;ion of
<PB N="19" REF="18">things to en&s;ue, and the reverend Bi&s;hops degraded, and made to &s;tarve, as do the French Prelates, in a fo|reign garret, upon &s;ix-pence a day; was the dignity of the peerage to be trampled on, and their augu&s;t hou&s;e laid in ruins; in &s;hort, was our wi&s;e and keen-&s;ighted monarch tumbled from his throne; the&s;e mi&s;creants, that bellow forth equality, the&s;e fire-and-faggot men, the&s;e incendiaries of the &s;tate, the&s;e murderers of the peace and happine&s;s of mankind, might have their wi&s;h; they might huzza, and trample over the deva&s;ta|tation they occa&s;ion; <HI>but what would it all tend to?</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Order, Order, Order!</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="19">was vociferou&s;ly called for, by the op|po&s;ition part of the room, and Patrick O'Conner, an Iri&s;hman, was louder than the re&s;t.&mdash; <Q>I beg lave, Mr. Pre&s;ident, (&s;aid he) to call the jontleman, that &s;poke la&s;t, to order; and to tell him a little bit of a &s;ecret; that tho&s;e who contend for leeberty, are neither torch-carriers, incendiaries, nor mur|derers; that Patrick O'Conner, that is to &s;ay, my own &s;elf, is one of the leeberty-boys in Dublin; but, though I was born in that city, I am, never|thele&s;s, d'ye &s;ee, an Engli&s;hman. It matters not at all where a man is born; he is not a hor&s;e, beca&s;e he was born in a &s;table. Our principles, Mr. Pre&s;ident, are to overtrow arbitrary
<PB N="21" REF="20">power, tyranny, and in&s;olence; and little Patrick O'Conner will never be wanting in his part, whil&s;t he is able to wield a &s;hilelah. Let me tell you, that our con&s;titution is no con&s;titution at all, at all; that the law was given, as Tommy Paine &s;ays, by a rogue of a conqueror, who&s;e name I have forgot; and it would be well for this country, if the Dukes and the Lords of Manors, d'ye &s;ee, forgot it too; we &s;hould have no &s;uch &s;quabbling about a &s;illy hare, or an in&s;ignificant partridge. The feudal &s;y&s;tem, Mr. Pre&s;ident, which, by the bye, is a &s;y&s;tem of oppre&s;&s;ion, was introduced by this &s;ame con|queror; and the government, in that
<PB N="22" REF="21">man's hands, was a government of de&s;poti&s;m. When he parcelled out the lands, which he took from their right owners, among his banditti, he gave the &s;taff out of his own hands; for, in a &s;hort &s;pace of time, in&s;tead of one tyrant in this country, there were many&mdash;fait, and you may &s;ay that too, there were two or three hundred. The&s;e men governed in|&s;tead of the King, and gave one of the Henry's, I am told, (the De'el burn him) lei&s;ure to play the &s;ame game in Ireland, and en&s;lave our dear, &s;weet country, as well as his own. The con&s;equence of this, Mr. Pre&s;ident, was, that in&s;tead of Kings ruling the Barons, the Barons ruled
<PB N="23" REF="22">the kings, and were far greater tyrants than he who created them. Upon this, d'ye &s;ee, the Kings of England took the alarm, and called an a&s;&s;embly of the people, that the na|tion might not be over-run with ari&s;|tocrates; but the&s;e over-bearing fel|lows, I under&s;tand, did not part with all their power, but &s;aid to the Com|mons, If you &s;it in one hou&s;e, to take care of your&s;elves, we will &s;it in another, to take care of <HI>our&s;elves,</HI> and the King, God ble&s;s him, &s;hall &s;it in a hou&s;e alone, be his own Pre&s;ident, and take care of <HI>him&s;elf.</HI> So that you &s;ee, Mr. Pre&s;ident, here are your tree e&s;tates of the empire, as that jontle|man &s;ays, who &s;poke la&s;t, and was
<PB N="24" REF="23">called to order. So that we are all now to take care of our&s;elves; and by my fait and con&s;cience, Patrick O'Connor will be the fir&s;t to do this. In &s;hort, it appears to me, that the&s;e tree e&s;tates, with the privilege of interrupting each other, have the great power of doing noting at all. What, then, is this mighty con&s;titu|tion we boa&s;t &s;o much of? A mere bubble. The people, it is true, have, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, acquired the a&s;|&s;cendency, have mollified and filed down, d'you &s;ee, the knots and rug|ged points of the cudgel held over them; but the cudgel, like my &s;hila|lah, is &s;trong, and tough enough to make them &s;mart. We have
<PB N="25" REF="24">We have heard gentlemen a great deal.&mdash;You may talk of your pri|vileges till you are tired. I &s;ee none equal to that of being at leeberty, to &s;top a fools mouth. By St. Patrick, I wi&s;h I had the &s;topping of all your mouths, you would then talk a little more to the purpo&s;e. &mdash;If you are for levelling, why do it by halves?&mdash;If you level one ting and not another, d'ye &s;ee, it will be like hill and dale&mdash;there will be be no equality. I'm for overtrow|ing the whole together. Down with the lawyers; let us tru&s;t to our&s;elves. Down with the churches; we can pray in our clo&s;ets. Down with the army; we can fight our own battles. Down with the whigs, and down with
<PB N="26" REF="25">the tories, and we &s;hall be all of one party. This will be &s;omething like an equality, and then, <HI>he who has the &s;tronge&s;t arm, will claim the bigge&s;t &s;hare.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>It has always been the &s;tudy of admini&s;tration,</HI> Mr. Chairman, &s;ince I have known what admini&s;tration is, (&s;ays Jack Latitat) who was one of the company, to do good to &s;o|ciety, and con&s;ult their ea&s;e, their happine&s;s, and intere&s;t. I defy any man, within his own memory, to de|ny the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion. Poli|ticians may differ in opinion, and op|po&s;e; but that oppo&s;ition, if they would &s;peak their hone&s;t &s;entiments, ri&s;es only from jealou&s;y, at their not be|ing employed in the affairs of go|vernment,
<PB N="27" REF="26">and from envy of tho&s;e who <HI>are</HI> employed. Look to all the acts of the &s;tate, and tell me, if they have not a good tendency; and that if any mea&s;ure has not an&s;wered the ex|pectation of parliament, it has not been immediately altered. There is nothing I &s;ee to complain of, but an in|judicious expenditure &s;ometimes of the public money; and why may not this be the ca&s;e as well under a repub|lican government, as in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things? I admit that the in|fluence of the Mini&s;ter in the Hou&s;e of Commons, is an evil that requires to be remedied, but the remedy lies with the people. If the electors of this kingdom would be &s;teady and
<PB N="28" REF="27">firm; lay down certain rules for their repre&s;entatives to follow, and deter|mine to elect no man, who &s;hould de|viate from the in&s;tructions he receives; one who has any apparent connec|tion with the Upper Hou&s;e, or, who holds any place under government; the evil by &s;uch per&s;everance would in time cea&s;e: but the electors are &s;uch blockheads as to &s;ell them&s;elves, and then wonder at being &s;old. This brings me, Mr. Chairman, to the &s;ubject, I was called on to explain, by the Scotch gentleman in the corner. He &s;ays, money &s;eems to have little value, and that I can tell you the &s;ame. There is a kind paradox in
<PB N="29" REF="28">this. Seldom do we meet with any thing of intrin&s;ic value, but it carries that value in its face or appearance; not &s;o in money: that it is a thing of ine&s;timable value is evident, for to what lengths will not men go, to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it? They will run into every exce&s;s, into every ab&s;urdity, and into every vice. They will &s;wear, flatter, vilify, abu&s;e, cheat, play the fool, &s;peak the truth, lie &s;quander, &s;crape together, plunder, nay even murder, to acquire it. Get money, if you can, hone&s;tly (&s;aid a writer of an|tiquity) but, however, get money; and when they have with great pains got it, what do they with it, but
<PB N="30" REF="29">throw it away on things of little or no value? The origin of all this ab|&s;urdity is, that the age is vicious and unprincipled, that men are looked up to, not for their abilities, their &s;er|vices, or good works, but for their property and wealth. See a man pa&s;|&s;ing by meanly clad; tell your friend that man is worth 100,000l, and he &s;tares at him again and again; but tell him there goes a good man, or there goes a man of great abilities, and he pa&s;&s;es unnoticed. Now, as the eyes of all men are turned upon riches, and that man is, <HI>coeteris paribus</HI> mo&s;t re&s;pected, who has mo&s;t money; every man tries to outvie his neigh|bour
<PB N="31" REF="30">and to make the be&s;t appear|ance he can.</Q></P>
<Q><L>Keep up appearances: there lies the text,</L>
<L>The would will give thee credit for the re&s;t.</L>
<BIBL><HI>Churchill.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P><Q>Under this notion he lives beyond his income, and thus lives a great deal upon the credit his trade&s;men give him; he &s;pends that money for them, which they have not the &s;pirit to &s;pend for them&s;elves. Trade&s;men in this ca&s;e are not to be pitied; it is only the biter bit. What leads men in trade to give uncommon credit, but to induce fools and &s;pendthrifts to deal with them, and to enable them to demand an inequitable and enor|mous profit? All ending in the love of that pelf, which, when they have
<PB N="32" REF="31">got, they rather throw away than make a proper u&s;e of. Extortion thus robs it&s;elf, and verifys the old pro|verb, Gra&s;p all, lo&s;e all. I am one who is up to all this; I &s;tudy to pu|ni&s;h the extortioner; in doing this, I enjoy many of the good things in life, which would otherwi&s;e e&s;cape me. There is an old law &s;ub&s;i&s;ting by pre&s;cription, that puts a rod in the hand of the extortioner to puni&s;h tho&s;e who attempt to puni&s;h him. I mean the law of arre&s;t. This is doubtle&s;s a law of oppre&s;&s;ion; and, owing to the great chicanery of this law, might overcomes right, thou|&s;ands of villains get their bread, and one man can trample upon another.
<PB N="33" REF="32">But government profits by this vil|lainy, and &s;uffers it to go on. This, like the venality of parliament, is an evil that calls loudly for redre&s;s; but, it does not follow, that a new &s;y&s;tem of government is nece&s;&s;ary on this. account or any other. Indeed, the la&s;t evil I complain of (I mean the Law of Attachment,) is no evil to me. I make a virtue of nece&s;&s;ity, have the myrmidons out of the pur&s;es of tho&s;e who employ them. Upon the whole, Mr. Chairman, the go|vernment is no great eye-&s;ore to me; the evils of life I reconcile to my|&s;elf, pa&s;s by the indifferent, get out of the way of the wor&s;t, and &s;cram|ble
<PB N="34" REF="33">through them as well as I can.</Q></P>
<P>Latitat, ca&s;ting his eyes on his friend Ramble, pu&s;hed his way up to him, &s;aid, he pre&s;umed he had heard non|&s;en&s;e enought for one night, and took him away.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI.</HEAD>
<P>THE Colonel had been in town &s;ome weeks, and had heard nothing of Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe, but &s;till had little to ap|prehend; having, when he left Scot|land,

Flint had a deal of &s;ly cunning about him, and was very adequate to the ta&s;k, nor had the Colonel rea&s;on to fear he would throw him&s;elf in Mr. Ra&s;pe's way, &s;o as to alarm his &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P>Bridget, Lady Da&s;hit's waiting-wo|man, never lo&s;t &s;ight of the &s;cheme &s;he had planned, of impo&s;ing Dangle's va|let on her mi&s;tre&s;s, in the character of
<PB N="36" REF="35">a gen|tleman in order to get at her fortune, and divide it between them; for this purpo&s;e &s;he was frequently with him at Dangle's lodgings, when his ma&s;ter was out. I will, therefore, lay before my readers a further dialogue of this hero and heroine, as taken down upon Tom's examination. You mu&s;t mind now (&s;ays Bridget when they next met), how you act, and take care not to be|tray your&s;elf. I have prepared my Lady to receive you &s;ome morning, of which I will let you know the day be|fore.

<P><PB N="38" REF="37"><HI>Tom.</HI> Let Tom alone for that; I be|lieve he has as much to &s;ay to the wo|men, and knows as well how to plea&s;e them, as any gentleman in town.</P>

<P>TO give my reader a farther in&s;ight into Spatter's character, who&s;e ly|ing di&s;po&s;ition often brought him into hot water; I will lay before him a dia|logue that pa&s;&s;ed between him, Rattle,
<PB N="41" REF="40">Dangle, and Saunter, one morning in a retired part of St. Jame's park, as it was related to my friend Will the next morn|ing. Rattle, Dangle, and Saunter were fir&s;t together walking; Rattle a&s;ked Dangle, among other things, concern|ing the &s;trange tale that was all the town over,&mdash;"Yes," (adds Saun|ter, with his u&s;ual &s;pleen, yawn|ing, as if he had been up all night, and &s;carce able to keep up with his compa|ny,) <Q>that you was turned out of &s;ome girl's hou&s;e for daring to make a pro|po&s;al to her.</Q>&mdash;<Q>No, no, (&s;ays Rat|tle) that's not the &s;tory, how was it Dangle?</Q>&mdash;<Q>You are plea&s;ed, Gen|tlemen, (returned he) to be very merry at my expence&mdash;there was no
<PB N="42" REF="41">turning out in he ca&s;e, nor any <HI>pro|po&s;al</HI> thought of.</Q>&mdash;<Q>That I'll be &s;worn, (&s;ays Rattle, addre&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf to Saunter) for he never had re&s;o|lution to propo&s;e to any woman.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Nor, if he had, (returned Saunter) would any woman li&s;ten to him. He has not addre&s;s &s;ufficient to draw at|tention.</Q> This nettled Dangle, and he retorted upon Saunter, <Q>Was I ble&s;|&s;ed with your vivacity (yawning and dragging his legs after him, in imita|tion of Saunter) and rhetoric, I might perhaps &s;tand a little chance.</Q> <Q>I had rather be a&s;leep all my life (re|plyed Saunter) than be treated with the contempt the girls treat you with.</Q> Dangle now grew warm,
<PB N="43" REF="42">&s;aid, <Q>the whole was a trumped up af|fair, and not a &s;yllable of truth in any part of it.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Nay, (&s;aid Rattle) Saunter's my author,</Q>&mdash;(and Saun|ter) <Q>Spatter's mine.</Q> Spatter at this in&s;tant joined them. <Q>Did not you tell me Spatter, (&s;ays Saun|ter, laughing) that Dangle was <HI>turn|ed out</HI> of &s;ome girl's hou&s;e, for <HI>daring</HI> to make a propo&s;al of marriage to her?</Q> Spatter now was gravelled. He fir&s;t eyed Dangle, then Saunter; con&s;cious of having &s;aid &s;o, and knowing it was fal&s;e, he knew not how well to bring him&s;elf off. But as tho&s;e who are continually telling lies, are al|ways on the look out for re&s;ources to excu&s;e them&s;elves; Spatter cries out,
<PB N="44" REF="43">&s;tarting, and lifting up his eyes, <Q><HI>Me!</HI>&mdash; Lord, Lord, how &s;tories are pervert|ed by carrying!&mdash;What I &s;aid was with a view of rai&s;ing Dangle in the opi|nion of his friends;&mdash;he,&mdash;you know is &s;aid to want re&s;olution,&mdash;and I...</Q> <Q>Sir?</Q> (replies Dangle, angrily, and interrupting him) Spatter &s;till at a lo&s;s how to proceed, continued, <Q>Re&s;olu|tion, I mean with re&s;pect to the <HI>wo|men.</HI> &mdash;How you take me up!&mdash;That is to &s;ay, you wait upon them for years, and trifle with them. Now, I wi&s;hed to have it known, that is by no mean the ca&s;e.&mdash;On Saunter's &s;ay|ing, Dangle will never get a wife, for the women de&s;pi&s;e him,&mdash;I beg your pardom, &s;ays I,&mdash;I beg your pardon,
<PB N="45" REF="44">many a girl would be glad to have him, but he is a man of di&s;cernment, and will not tie him&s;elf where he is not likely to be happy.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Did not you (returned Saunter, &s;taring in Spatter's face, with a look of re&s;ent|ment) Did not you &s;ay that he was <HI>turned out of doors?</HI></Q> Spatter, who now began to wi&s;h him&s;elf any where but where he was, replied, <Q>You &s;hall hear what I &s;aid, if you have but pa|tience.</Q> (Rattle continuing Saunters method of addre&s;s) <Q>Ay, and that they &s;lapped the door in his face?</Q> And Saunter again, without &s;uffering Spatter to reply, <Q>and that he was forbidden to come there any more?</Q> Spatter, now lo&s;ing all temper, cried <Q>No,&mdash;no,&mdash;
<PB N="46" REF="45"><HI>no!</HI></Q>&mdash;(uttering each <HI>no</HI> with a degree of increa&s;ed vociferation). <Q>It is im|po&s;&s;ible gentlemen to go on, if I am to be &s;o interrupted!&mdash;(then lowering his tone), Let me &s;ee,</Q>&mdash;recollecting him&s;elf,) <Q>Where was I?&mdash;Oh! that Dangle was a man of di&s;cernment, and would not fix where there was not a pro&s;pect of happine&s;s&mdash;where there was not a pro&s;pect of happi|ne&s;s:</Q> <Q>&s;o far (&s;ays I) from his trifling with the women; to my certain know|ledge he made a propo&s;al of marriage the other day to a very re&s;pectable lady, whom I could name, if I thought proper, but with whom he could not &s;ucceed, from an unconquerable aver|&s;ion &s;he had to him</Q> Here Rattle
<PB N="47" REF="46">laughed heartily at Dangle, and cried <Q>Go on Spatter,&mdash;let's have it,&mdash;all the women hate him.</Q> Saunter, who was half a&s;leep at this part of the &s;to|ry, but who was rou&s;ed by Rattle's noi&s;e, &s;tarts, and cries, <Q>How, how? I lo&s;t that&mdash;</Q>&mdash;<Q>Where's the won|der? (&s;ays Rattle to him)&mdash;Why, was not you awake?</Q>&mdash;Dangle now addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Spatter, &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;king him, <Q>what he meant by repre|&s;enting things &s;o falely; told him he was a mongrel, between ill nature, and fal&s;e art, and might be well cla&s;&s;ed with the&s;e creatures, whom God never made. What aver&s;ion, (conti|nued he) could &s;he have to <HI>me?</HI></Q> Spatter now grew warm, and declared,
<PB N="48" REF="47">he never &s;aid any &s;uch thing; <Q>how can I go on (&s;aid he) with the rela|tion, if you break in upon me &s;o often? &mdash;I &s;aid unconquerable aver&s;ion to, <HI>it</HI>&mdash;that is to <HI>matrimony;</HI> winking at Rattle and Saunter) I could never &s;up|po&s;e any woman could have an aver|&s;ion to <HI>you;</HI> No, that would be unna|tural (&s;neering and &s;aying to him&s;elf) I mu&s;t get out of this d&mdash;m'd diffi|culty &s;ome way) <HI>aver&s;ion to it</HI> were the words, that is, to <HI>marriage,</HI> for unac|countable as it is, &s;ome women are aver&s;e to it. There's Lady Bab Squeami&s;h, and many more I could mention of the &s;ame turn:&mdash;and that this lady to whom you propo&s;ed, re|que&s;ted time to con&s;ider of it;&mdash;that
<PB N="49" REF="48">was all. Upon my &s;oul, gentlemen, if your ears are &s;o treacherous as to mi&s;lead your under&s;tandings, I mu&s;t lock up my mouth in future. Saun|ter, are you for the billiard table?</Q> <Q>I am, (&s;ays he, yawning,) agreeable to any thing.</Q>&mdash;<Q>For, (continues Rattle, imitating Saunter,) he has nothing to do. Saunter is a man of great bu&s;ine&s;s, and is jaded to death every day with doing nothing. Eating, drinking, &s;leeping,&mdash;every thing fatigues him. He is too lazy even to put his own cloaths on.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Don't call it <HI>lazine&s;s,</HI> (&s;aid Spatter) you do him wrong; it is a philo&s;ophic indolence, the work of a mind, wean|ed from all the pur&s;uits of life.</Q>&mdash;
<Q><PB N="50" REF="49">No, no. (returned Rattle) it is a con|&s;titutional idlene&s;s. So idle is he, that I believe, if he was under the nece&s;&s;ity of working for his living, he would &s;uffer him&s;elf to peri&s;h with hunger.&mdash; &mdash;You are a lazy fellow, Spatter, but you love to talk; but even talking tires Saunter.</Q>&mdash;<Q>I wi&s;h, (returned Saunter to Rattle) talking tired <HI>you.</HI> I will own to you that there is not any thing &s;o tire&s;ome to one&s;elf as an idle life; but the le&s;s a man &s;ays, the le&s;s non&s;en&s;e he broaches, and the le&s;s tire&s;ome he is to others. <HI>Verbum &s;apienti;</HI> if the cap fits you, Rattle, wear it.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Come, Gentlemen,(&s;ays, Dangle,) don't let us be &s;parring here; let us adjourn to the table, and
<PB N="51" REF="50">try if we can get into better humour.</Q> Saunter dropping his hat, begged of Rattle to pick it up for him. <Q>Not I, (&s;ays Rattle) you have nothing to do, you know, and therefore may &s;toop for it your&s;elf.</Q> He then applyed to Dangle for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. <Q>Rot me if I do,</Q> (&s;aid Dangle). He a&s;ked Spatter, but Spatter al&s;o re|fu&s;ing, was obliged to &s;toop for it him&s;elf; but did it with that difficulty attendant upon indolence: and picking up his hat, he dropped his &s;tick, which he thus addre&s;&s;ed, <Q>I won't be at the trouble of &s;tooping again for <HI>you,</HI> however; you may lie there till the next per&s;on comes by; and if he picks you up, he'll de&s;erve you.</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>MY friend Will, who, in the goodne&s;s of his heart, having been &s;ecurity, for one of his acquaintances, for the &s;um of 500l. &s;igned a bond in judg|ment for the &s;ame, was now called on, in a ho&s;tile manner, for the money; and not being ma&s;ter of that &s;um, was arre&s;ted, and his goods taken in execution. With a degree of im|prudence, on a pre&s;umption that he &s;hould marry Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe, and in order that he might have a place to bring her to, he took a hou&s;e in London, and furni&s;hed it elegantly, and thus &s;tripped him&s;elf of the be&s;t part of his ready
<PB N="53" REF="52">ea&s;h. He had &s;ome &s;ecurities, as I have mentioned, which his father left him; and he meant to rai&s;e money on the &s;ame, not only for him&s;elf, but for his friend Charles Simple. That young gentleman, however, having &s;ettled his matters with his wife's father, &s;tood not in need of it; of cour&s;e, Ramble, having, as he thought, &s;ufficient for his pre&s;ent exigencies, deferred making any application for more; and not be|ing provided for this unexpected call, was hurried away to the hou&s;e of a &s;he|riff's officer. Spatter &s;oon heard of it, ha&s;ted to Lady Da&s;hit's with the news, and meeting with her lady|&s;hip, and Mi&s;s Trevor together, <Q>Ble&s;s me, Ladies,</Q> (&s;aid he, almo&s;t out of
<PB N="54" REF="53">breath) <Q>I have the mo&s;t unfortunate piece of news to tell you&mdash;the mo&s;t unlucky circum&s;tance</Q>... The ladies were alarmed, and Lady Da&s;hit inter|rupted him with <Q>not very bad I hope?</Q>&mdash;<Q>Bad? (returned he)&mdash; Poor Colonel Ramble!&mdash;I am &s;o di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed, I hardly know how to ralate it.</Q> Mi&s;s Trevor was ready to faint, and &s;aying, in a low voice, <Q>&s;he hoped nothing had happened to the Colo|nel.</Q> Lady Da&s;hit, wi&s;hing to &s;mo|ther it, &s;aid, <Q>No, <HI>not</HI> to Colonel Ram|ble,</Q> and &s;aid to Spatter, <Q>For God's &s;ake don't mention the Colo|nel here.&mdash;(and winking at him) You have nothing to tell us about Colonel Ramble?</Q> But he, not taking the
<PB N="55" REF="54">hint, went on, <Q>It is <HI>all</HI> about Ram|able &mdash;had it happened to any other per&s;on, it would not have affected me.</Q> Mi&s;s Trevor, rather recovered, enquired if he had met with any acci|dent, any fall, or wound. <Q>No, Ma'am, (&s;aid Spatter) he has not fallen into a bog, nor into a mill-pond; that would be nothing; there would be &s;ome hopes of getting him out from thence;&mdash;but he has fallen....</Q> At the&s;e words Mi&s;s Trevor had near|ly fainted a &s;econd time, and Lady Da&s;hit could not help &s;aying to Spatter, <Q>See what your fooli&s;h tongue does.&mdash; I'll lay my life, after all, it is nothing of any con&s;equence. (adding angrily) Where has he fallen?</Q>&mdash;<Q>Into the
<PB N="56" REF="55">hands of the <HI>lawyers!</HI>&mdash;(&s;aid Spatter) Is <HI>that</HI> of no con&s;equence? Rot me if I would not as &s;oon have fallen from a hou&s;e-top.</Q>&mdash;<Q>That, (return|ed Lady Da&s;hit) I long expected. You fee, my dear Emily, (ad|dre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to Mi&s;s Trevor who was now in little better &s;pirits) how this mighty accident turns out, at which you were &s;o much alarmed.</Q> <Q>I am, an&s;wered Mi&s;s Trevor, of Mr. Spatter's opinion, that a man cannot have a wor&s;e thing hap|pen to him, than to fall into the hands of the lawyers.</Q> <Q>So, &s;ay I, Mi&s;s Trevor (returned Spatter) &s;o &s;ay I.</Q> <Q>Be kind enough (&s;ays Mi&s;s Trevor) to tell us the par|ticulars,
<PB N="57" REF="56">I am anxious to know them!</Q>&mdash;<Q>I thought you would (re|turned Spatter)&mdash;that made me hurry &s;o fa&s;t here; I have not &s;top|ped at any one place, &s;ince I heard it; but to drop a hint of it, at Lady Bab's, and at another hou&s;e or two in my way.</Q>&mdash;<Q>That is to &s;ay (ob&s;erved Lady Da&s;hit, a&s;ide) totrum|pet it all the town over.</Q> Mi&s;s Trevor (with a well di&s;po&s;ed heart remarked) that if he was in any difficulty, it mu&s;t have been good-nature, that brought him into it; but Spatter with that rancour, that led him to mi&s;con&s;true the be&s;t actions, replied: <Q>What you are plea&s;ed to call <HI>good-nature,</HI> I
<PB N="58" REF="57">call <HI>folly. His</HI> good natured ac|tions ari&s;e from o&s;tentation. I would take care of my&s;elf, before I thought of others. Self-pre&s;ervation, is the fir&s;t law of nature, and he that does not attend to it, de&s;erves no pity.</Q>&mdash;<Q>If I have not been mi&s;|informed, (&s;aid Mi&s;s Trevor) you, Mr. Spatter, have experienced the good effects of his attention.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Aye (added Lady Da&s;hit) and a grateful man, will never forget pa&s;t &s;ervices.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Don't apprehend Lady Da&s;hit (retorted Spatter &s;nearingly) that I am under any obligations to Colonel Ramble. What he has done for me, were mere acts of civility. No, Madam, I have always taken
<PB N="59" REF="58">care to avoid being under obliga|tions to a man of <HI>his</HI> &s;tamp.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Well (returns Mi&s;s Trevor) we will not enter into that. I wi&s;h only to know his pre&s;ent &s;ituation.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Un|willing as I am (an&s;wered Spatter) to enter into this unhappy affair of Ramble's; for, with all his faults, I have a regard for him; (and I hate go&s;&s;iping mortally) I cannot <HI>but</HI> obey your commands. 'You mu&s;t know then, ladies, that the Colonel was imprudent enough to be &s;ecu|rity for Sam Carele&s;s, to extricate him from a difficulty. He entered into a bond of 500<HI>l,</HI> Sam has left him in the lurch, Ramble is ar|re&s;ted on the bond, and an execu|tion
<PB N="60" REF="59">is &s;ent into his hou&s;e!&mdash;that's all.</Q> Mi&s;s Trevor ob&s;erved, it was but a trifling &s;um to a man of his for|tune.&mdash; <Q>Trifling as it is (returns Spat|ter) it has lodged him in a &s;pung|ing-hou&s;e.</Q> Lady Da&s;hit a&s;ked him, if he meant to call on him there; ob&s;erving, it would be humane in his friends to do it now. Spatter ter &s;aid, he would not &s;ee him for the world. He had to great a regard for him, and it would affect him too much. Be&s;ides, his time was too much taken up.&mdash; <Q>I have more than twenty places to call at, this day; could ill &s;pare the time to &s;lip in here, only I was eager to acquaint you with the news;</Q>&mdash;
<PB N="61" REF="60">(and, as Lady Da&s;hit ob&s;erved to Emily, a&s;ide) <Q>le&s;t any other &s;hould do it before him.</Q></P>
<P>Mi&s;s Trevor was quite unhappy at this account, and was deter|mined, if &s;he could contrive it, &s;o as that the Colonel &s;hould not know from what quarter his relea&s;e came, to &s;end the money for his di&s;charge.</P>
<P>When a man falls into the hands of the Lawyers he cannot, generally &s;peaking, &s;urely fall into wor&s;e hands. Putting the attornies out of the que&s;tion, I have often con&s;idered, with my&s;elf, and endeavoured to
<PB N="62" REF="61">reconcile with ju&s;tice, the profe&s;&s;on of a barri&s;ter. Does he not plead the cau&s;e of equity, and does he not help tho&s;e out, who cannot or could not plead for them&s;elves? Some, I will admit, do, but &s;ome do not. If a barri&s;ter would act con&s;cientiou&s;ly, take up no cau&s;e till he has well examined it, and not argue in its defence, unle&s;s there is legal, hone&s;t ground for &s;o doing, he would be a prai&s;e-worthy cha|racter; but, when a barri&s;ter will take up any cau&s;e that is propo&s;ed to him, right or wrong, it rever&s;es the ca&s;e. It is the misfortune that, barri&s;ters never &s;ee their briefs till they are retained; and, when
<PB N="63" REF="62">once retained, if they do not ex|ert them&s;elves in defence of their clients, whether this client be an hone&s;t man or a villain, they are cen|&s;ured in their profe&s;&s;ion, and are &s;ure to lo&s;e the favour of the attornies that employ them. Now, he that has the mo&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s at the bar, is, all things con&s;idered, a wor&s;e man, and a wor&s;e member of &s;ociety, than if he had le&s;s eminence; for the more cau&s;es a barri&s;ter is engaged in, the more inju&s;tice he does. The man, who has the happy facility of converting truth into fal&s;ehood, of explaining away right, and making the be&s;t &s;tand again&s;t ju&s;tice and equity; is &s;ure to have
<PB N="64" REF="63">the mo&s;t briefs. If he knows how to brow-beat an evidence, perplex and puzzle him, &s;o as to make him &s;eemingly contradict him&s;elf, and is ma&s;ter of &s;uch fallacious ar|guments as will mi&s;lead an unin|formed, ignorant jury; he is deemed clever, and reckoned a good orator; (for &s;uch, I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, is too much the oratory of the bar,) and bu&s;ine&s;s will flow in upon him fa&s;t. His di&s;tingui&s;hed abilities make the attornies in a bad cau&s;e, fly to him in preference; and thus, of twenty cau&s;es, he is likely to have eighteen bad ones to de|fend. Now, if he, who father's a lie, and promulgates it, as we have
<PB N="65" REF="64">&s;een Spatter do, is equally criminal with the fabricator or inventor; he, &s;urely, who takes up a bad cau&s;e, is equally criminal with the party who employs him. There may be &s;ome plea in favour of a man who e&s;pou&s;es &s;uch a cau&s;e from error of judgment, from fal&s;e conception, or from ignorance; but there can be none for him who takes pay to plead in behalf of the oppre&s;&s;or, and to the injury of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. Such a one is a mercenary hireling, an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, and robber of the un|fortunate; and &s;o far from being commendable, like the &s;landerer we have &s;een, he de&s;erves execra|tion by all good men; and the
<PB N="66" REF="65">&s;o, in proportion, to the abilities he has of perverting judgment, and the power he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es of doing it. His eminence at the bar is a colla|teral proof of the ba&s;ene&s;s of his mind.</P>
<P>It is, under this idea, that in Sweden, and &s;ome other countries, a man is obliged to plead his own cau&s;e; the profe&s;&s;ion of a barri&s;ter being there held in &s;o odious and contemptible a light, that no gen|tleman, will take it up; the execu|tioner in Sweden is a far more re|&s;pectable character. Putting the im|morality of the profe&s;&s;ion out of the que&s;tion, its civil turpitude, is
<PB N="67" REF="66">there held too great to be any way countenanced. If a barri&s;ter, though retained, would dare to throw down his brief, when he finds his cau&s;e a bad one, it would render him an exalted character; and &s;hould he, by this mode of conduct, be at the the receipt of le&s;s money, he would have more reputation, would de|&s;erve what he earns, and enjoy it with credit and an unappalling con&s;cience.</P>

<P>THOUGH Spatter thought proper to de&s;ert his friend in di&s;tre&s;s, it was not &s;o with Rattle, Dangle, and Latitat. Rattle and Dangle, not know|ing where to find Ramble, flew to his hou&s;e, then taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of by a &s;heriff's officer; who; when they enter|ed, was &s;moaking a pipe with a tan|kard in his hand, comforting him&s;elf with the good birth he had, and &s;ay|ing there was plenty of &s;tout in the cel|lar, and he hoped the gentleman would not be able to make up his affairs while that la&s;ted. Rattle and Dangle came together, and, on enquiring if
<PB N="69" REF="68">any of Colonel Ramble's people were in the way, was an&s;wered by this &s;urly fellow, "No." Attempting to go into &s;ome of the inward rooms, the officer &s;topped them with <Q>Hey, hey! Where are you going? I am ma&s;ter of this hou&s;e, and there's no admittance for <HI>you.</HI> I am placed here to &s;ee that nothing's carried off, and there|fore, &s;han't tru&s;t either of you out of my &s;ight.</Q> On their &s;aying they wi&s;hed to &s;ee the Colonel, and a&s;king, where he was; this fellow replied, <Q>At the lock-up-hou&s;e in Chancery Lane, where, I believe, you'll find him any day this week. After this if you want him, you mu&s;t look for him in the Bench.</Q> <Q>The
<PB N="70" REF="69">King's Bench you mean,</Q> &s;ays Rat|tle. <Q>Aye, (returned the officer) the King's Bench, I &s;uppo&s;e you know the place; it won't be the fir&s;t time you have been there, I dare &s;ay.</Q> <Q>Cea&s;e your impertinence, friend, (&s;aid Dangle) we &s;ay nothing to give you offence.</Q> <Q>Marry (retorts the fellow) there's no cau&s;e to be angry; many an hone&s;t gentleman has lodged in that place, and many a noe <HI>will</HI> again. When they're overwhelmed with debts, they go there to pay them.</Q> <Q>You mean (&s;ays Rattle) to retrench their expences?</Q>&mdash;<Q>I mean no &s;uch thing, (&s;aid the of|ficer.) I have known a man live as well there, as in any part of the
<PB N="71" REF="70">kingdom, keep as good a table, and as genteel an equipage; and, in term|time, at liberty to go as far any day as he plea&s;es: and, what's the be&s;t of it, all this at the expence of other people.</Q>&mdash;<Q>True, (replied Dangle) there is &s;ome plea&s;ure in that con|&s;ideration; and, (a&s;ide to Rattle) What a dry dog it is?</Q> <Q>You &s;ay in Chancery Lane?</Q> (&s;ays Rattle.) <Q>Yes, (replied the fellow) in Chan|cery Lane, hard by the pump, where the lawyers drink in non-term.</Q> Dangle, ob&s;erving to Rattle, that things wore a &s;trange face to what they did a few hours ago; Rattle cried, <Q>Pugh! he'll be out again to|morrow; and nothing adds more to
<PB N="72" REF="71">a man's credit, in the police world, than to have an execution or two in his hou&s;e. There's my Lord Squan|der has had eleven at one time; he puts the fellows into livery; they line the pa&s;&s;age as his company pa&s;s, and cut a very re&s;pectable figure. A friend of his of&s;erving to him one day, that the had an uncommon &s;uite of &s;ervants; his an&s;wer was, that he was never without them." It re|quires contrivance only to make di&s;|grace fa&s;hionable. You know how Latitat glories in writs and arre&s;ts.</Q> Scarce had he &s;aid the&s;e words, but Latitat bolts into the room; his coat frogged with writs, and a bunch of them in his hat, by way of a cockade. He
<PB N="73" REF="72">pa&s;&s;ed by Rattle and Dangle, run up to the officer, and &s;hook him by the had, with <Q>Hah, my friend Spunge, how goes it?</Q> The officer here was all humility and re&s;pect, enquired how his Honour did; a&s;ked him to drink, and al&s;o to walk into any apartment he plea&s;ed. And, why all this? be|cau&s;e Jack was in fee with all the &s;he|riff's officers in London. Having paid his re&s;pects to this man, he turned to his friends, &s;aying, <Q>You &s;eem to &s;tare at all this; that's becau&s;e you are not up to it. I have &s;uch a re&s;pect for &s;heriffs officers, arre&s;ts, and writs, that you &s;ee I am cloathed in them.</Q> <Q>I make it a rule never to pay a
<PB N="74" REF="73">bill till I am arre&s;ted. So you &s;ee what a patriot I am, and how much I &s;tudy the good of my coun|try. Shew me the man, among all your acquaintance, except my&s;elf, who will pay two guineas in&s;tead of one, in order to increa&s;e the reve|nue of the &s;tamps. The ea&s;y credit-giving world, don't like much trouble. Was I to pay a bill on being a&s;ked to do it, it would not an&s;wer my plan. I never di&s;charge an account without being &s;ued. I endeavour to deal with tho&s;e only who dread the law; but when I am arre&s;ted, I pay, and then only; and if, upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, I pay a little more than I otherwi&s;e
<PB N="75" REF="74">&s;hould, a &s;econd &s;atisfaction hangs to it. With all my &s;mattering for trade, you know I hate keeping accounts, and filing receipts; and when I pay the accommodation-fee, I con&s;ider my&s;elf &s;afe from being obliged, as many are, to pay the &s;ame bill a &s;econd time; for a writ and its di&s;charge, is a receipt in court.</Q>&mdash;<Q>You are, (replied Rattle) my dear Jack, one of the happie&s;t fellows of the age. You extract virtue from nece&s;&s;ity, enjoy what would be the di&s;a&s;ter of thou&s;ands, and &s;cramble on through life, as you call it, without a &s;cratch or a pain.</Q>&mdash;<Q>It would do your heart good, Rattle, (continued he) to come and
<PB N="76" REF="75">&s;ee my ve&s;tibule; I am now fitting it up, and, though you will &s;carce believe it, I buy the hangings of the lawyers.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Hanging it, (&s;aid Dangle) with old parchments I &s;up|po&s;e?</Q>&mdash;<Q>Not quite &s;o bas as that, (retorts he) my hangings are &s;uit|able to the expenditure and figure of a man of 2000<HI>l.</HI> a year. There's not a &s;quare inch that co&s;ts me le&s;s than a guinea; and by the time I have hung the whole room, it will co&s;t me &s;ome thou&s;ands. I &s;hall do it, however, at la&s;t, my boy, (exult|ing) and then I &s;hall immortalize my name. Every writ I am &s;erved with, I tack up again&s;t the wall, leaving one end loo&s;e, and it gives

A de&s;cendant of the olde&s;t Briti&s;h family, could not be prouder, in an ancient hall of audience, of the trophies of his pro|genitors.&mdash; <HI>Haec &s;unt in&s;ignia mea!&mdash;</HI> The&s;e are my banners&mdash;the glorious atchievements of my ance&s;try.

<P>You had better get into Parliament, <Q>(&s;aid Rattle) it would be cheaper in the end, though you paid a few thou&s;ands for your &s;eat.</Q>&mdash;<Q>P&s;ha, man, (returns he) that would fru&s;|trate my whole plan, there's not a fool that would tru&s;t a member of parliament, now, with five pounds. That time's over&mdash;the Hou&s;e of Commons is not what it was; there are &s;o many mercenary and poverty|&s;truck fellows, now get them&s;elves elected, that this honourable hou&s;e is lo&s;ing credit daily.</Q></P>
<P>The reader will indulge me here
<PB N="79" REF="78">with a few remarks on the law of ar|re&s;ts. To what do they tend, but to the injury of &s;ociety? The de&s;ign of attachment, was merely to prevent the defendant from e&s;caping, whil&s;t the matter again&s;t him was under litigation: if he can give &s;ecurity for his appearance, it is all the law re|quires; if not, he is held in cu&s;tody, to wait the event. So far it is poli|tical; but the cau&s;e being ended, an execution following, if the defendant has no property to pay the debt, why con&s;ine his per&s;on, take him out of &s;ociety, throw his family upon the pari&s;h, and deprive the &s;tate of his la|bours? Does it pay his debts?&mdash;No! &mdash;The execution might &s;eize his pro|perty,
<PB N="80" REF="79">and if there be not &s;ufficient to di&s;charge the debt and co&s;ts, he &s;hould be obliged to pay the remainder at &s;ome future time, which, by giving him his liberty, he might be able to do. As things are now, the debtor is confined, his credit ruined, his fami|mily beggared, he waits for an in|&s;olvent act, and his creditor lo&s;es his money. The manner in which the law can harra&s;s a debtor, may frighten &s;ome men from running into debt, but it hardens others, and puts them on their invention, as it has done Jack Latitat. But the greate&s;t evil ari&s;ing from arre&s;ts, is the abu&s;e of this law, and the many villains it creates. Many a hundred pettifoggers there are,
<PB N="81" REF="80">who have no re&s;ource for a mainte|nance but this. They retain a number of runners, (to whom they give half their fees) to find out litigious men, and ra&s;cals, that have fraudulent and ficti|tious claims upon the property of others, accompanied, perhaps, with a &s;pecious claim of forty &s;hillings, but which, under fair di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, might be di&s;|proved. Whether the&s;e claimants have any &s;ub&s;tance or not, provided the de|fendant has, it is all they want. They undertake to carry on the cau&s;e for them, prevail on them to &s;wear to debts not exi&s;ting; arre&s;t the defend|ant; not &s;uffer the plaintiff to be met with; run the cau&s;e to i&s;&s;ue, and the defendant either then proceeds to trial,
<PB N="82" REF="81">or, not knowing what &s;uch villains may there &s;wear to, is induced to pay a certain part of it into court, which is accepted, and the cau&s;e ends: but with the expence of 20<HI>l.</HI> or more to the defendant; be&s;ides all the di&s;|grace and trouble of the arre&s;t. Nay, there are men that will go farther. Such attornies, in hopes of having the mat|ters compromi&s;ed, and getting their co&s;ts paid, will &s;erve writs and run the ri&s;k, if the defendant is a man of &s;pirit, and determined to go on with it, they will drop the cau&s;e at i&s;&s;ue; and &s;hould the attorney get nothing from the defend|ant, he will, if po&s;&s;ible, from his client, and the defendant has his own attor|ney to pay, perhaps, 15 or 20<HI>l.</HI> This:
<PB N="83" REF="82">might be recovered of the plaintiff, if he could be found, or was worth pow|der and &s;hot, but he is a pauper and not to be met with. Both the attornies however have profited, and the defend|ant has been the chief &s;uffere.&mdash;To &s;hew how dangerous &s;uch men are in &s;ociety, take the following anecdote.</P>
<P>An attorney &s;eated him&s;elf in a country-town, where he thought there was a good opening; no attorney having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place. He had a &s;mall independenoe of his own, but the people there being of a peaceful di&s;po&s;ition, he had little or no bu&s;ine&s;s, and his own money not being &s;ufficient to &s;upport him, he
<PB N="84" REF="83">told a friend, one day, that he &s;hould be under the nece&s;&s;ity of removing his &s;ituatiions, for the inhabitants of that town were &s;o d&mdash;m&mdash;d peaceable, that he could not live among&s;t them. Be|ing a plea&s;ant fellow, and his friend, unwilling to lo&s;e him, he gave him this advice; "Bring &s;ome other attorney to &s;ettle in the town be&s;ides your&s;elf, and my life for it, you'll find your ac|count int it." He took the hint, ano|ther of the fraternity was invited there to re&s;idence; di&s;&s;entions were thus rai&s;ed among the people, and the two attornies go a very good living.</P>
<P>Was there a law enacted, that every attorney &s;hould give &s;ome thou&s;and
<PB N="85" REF="84">pounds &s;ecurity to the public, on his admi&s;&s;ion, and if he was non&s;uited in any cau&s;e, be obliged to pay the co&s;ts him&s;elf; he would take care never to engage but in a good cau&s;e, or oblige his client to give him &s;ecu|rity for tho&s;e co&s;ts, in ca&s;e he failed in the action. This would prevent a a great number of vexatious and liti|gious &s;uits; and if there were fewer ra&s;cally attornies, there would be more peace and happine&s;s in &s;ociety,</P>

<P>MISS Trevor found means to free Ramble from his confinement. She found out the officer, and got a friend to carry him the 500<HI>l.</HI> and the expences, without &s;aying where it came from; and my friend was at full liberty, without the &s;atisfaction of knowing who was his liberator. He was exceedingly de&s;irous of finding it out, and took uncommon pains &s;o to do.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was he at home, than he received the congratulations of his friends, and tho&s;e of Spatter in parti|cular
<PB N="87" REF="86">who flew to him with feeming rap|ture, crying out, <Q>My dear Colonel, I have been all the town over in &s;earch of a friend to extricate you from the difficulty your good heart threw you into; and with that view I have told your &s;tory to all my acquaintance; but I am happy to find the bu&s;ine&s;s is done without me. It was d&mdash;m'd &s;habby of Carele&s;s to draw you in to.</Q>...<Q>I don't &s;ee it in that light, (replied Ramble) poor fellow, he would have paid the money if he could, and as he could not, it was, and is, my wi&s;h to do it for him.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Yes, (returned Spatter), but the di&s;grace of it! </Q>&mdash;<Q>Di&s;grace it can|not be; (&s;aid Ramble) A man
<PB N="88" REF="87">ought never to be a&s;hamed of &s;uf|fering in a good cau&s;e. He who fears to encounter a di&s;&s;iculty for a friend, ill de&s;erves to have one.</Q></P>
<P>If I may be allowed to &s;ay any thing in addition to tho&s;e of my friend Will, upon the occurrences he met with, I will here take the liberty of laying before my reader a character I have met with, too common in life, but being mixed with the world at large, is often lo&s;t in the crowd, and not noticed. This is that of a man who purcha&s;es a good name from the two lower cla&s;&s;es of people, which, indeed, is the ma&s;s of men, able to &s;tamp a character with re&s;pect or di&s;|re&s;pect,
<PB N="89" REF="88">for they are the greater part of the people, and it is too univer&s;ally believed that what the world &s;ays mu&s;t be true. If a man but pays his debts when called on, is free with his money, and puts up with no indignity, he is, in the eye of the pre&s;ent age, a man of honour, and a gentleman. His moral character is &s;eldom enquired into: he may get drunk, keep as many whores as he will, and be the greate&s;t libertine uncen&s;ured. Such a man will have much longer credit than others, and treade&s;men will be more obedient to his call; for it is &s;elf-inte|re&s;t that leads mankind, and even warps their way of thinking. I knew a gen|tleman of &s;mall fortune, but who had
<PB N="90" REF="89">a fuffielent income to pay all his tradef|men; he was an economi&s;t, and not void of principle. I heard this gentleman, once chide his wife, &s;oon after mar|riage, for paying a bill una&s;ked. It is time enough (&s;aid he) to pay when two or three bills have been &s;ent in. He did not act on the principle of <HI>Latitat,</HI> who, by witholding a debt due, made intere&s;t of the money, but acted on the idea that it is right to do as the world does. Nothing, (con|tinued he) is &s;o unfa&s;hionable as to call for a trade&s;man's account. If you make it a rule to do this, you may be called a good pay-ma&s;ter, but you will be vulgar in the extreme. This gen|tleman did not plead want of ca&s;h, but
<PB N="91" REF="90">was never at home to his trade&s;men; he kept a lying fellow at his door, who, after many years importuning gained them acce&s;s to his ma&s;ter, only by the pre&s;entment of a fee. But yet this gentleman when he <HI>did</HI> pay, never exa|mined the particulars of a bill, let it be of ever &s;o long &s;tanding, but refer|red only to the &s;um total, and paid like a gentleman. <Q>Your honour will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve (&s;ays the ob&s;e|quious trade&s;man) that I have charg|ed every artiele at the lowe&s;t price, and I hope your goods plea&s;ed.</Q>&mdash;<Q>I am perfectly &s;atisfied, (&s;aid the gentleman) and think my&s;elf much obliged to you.</Q> The money paid, they part, one with &s;eeming gratitude,
<PB N="92" REF="91">the other with profe&s;&s;ions of future employ. I was once with him when he paid his taylor a long bill of &s;ix years &s;tanding, the amount of which was 370<HI>l.</HI> he looked only at the &s;um total, and on my enquiring when the taylor was gone, whether he never ex|amined into the article of a bibl. <Q>Articles? (retorted he) Z&mdash;nds, if I looked at <HI>them,</HI> I &s;hould go mad; for my taylor is as great a ra&s;cal as ever lived. I would not deal with him, but he gives me long credit.</Q> This credit, if he managed his little fortune well, he would not want, and if he paid his taylor yearly, whil&s;t the artickes were in remembrance, he would &s;ave 30 per cent; but to be thought fa&s;hion|ble,
<PB N="93" REF="92">he cho&s;e to have fa&s;hionable credit, and be thought a man of ho|nour. He had lived long enought in the world to know, that a good name is ea&s;ily acquired by purcha&s;e, and there|fore he bought that good name. He was liberal to the poor in his neight|bourhood, not from a principle of charity, for he gave away indi&s;crimi|nately. I went with him once to a public hou&s;e in his village, to a&s;k &s;ome que&s;tions of the landlord. It was winter, and three or four impudent country fellows were &s;itting round the &s;ire with their hats on. One of them &s;aid to the re&s;t, loud enough to be heard, leering with his. eye, and put|ting out his tongue, <Q>Twig the
<PB N="94" REF="93">Squire.</Q> This did not di&s;concert him; he &s;topped any further di&s;re&s;pect by &s;aying to the landlord it was cold weather, pitied tho&s;e who were obliged to work abroad for their living, order|ed him to make tho&s;e lads at the fire, a three &s;hilling bowl of good warm punch, and begged they would drink his health. No &s;ooner was the pur|cha&s;e made, than the article re&s;pect was immediately delivered. The fel|lows no &s;ooner heard him give this di|rection to the landlord, than they jump|ed from their &s;eats, with <Q>Won't your honour plea&s;e to come to the fire?</Q> and, on quitting the hou&s;e he ob&s;erved to me, <Q>You &s;ee how readily a few &s;hilling &s;often down roughne&s;s of
<PB N="95" REF="94">man|ners, and in&s;olence of behaviour, into complai&s;ance and re&s;pect.</Q> Pa&s;&s;ing a turnpike with me one day, in his own pari&s;h, he gave the toll|gatherer a &s;hilling, with <Q>I don't re|collect having given you any thing to drink a long time.</Q>&mdash;<Q>This man, (&s;aid I) is one of your tenants, I pre&s;ume?</Q>&mdash;<Q>I &s;carce know his name, (replied my friend) but I ne|ver forgot to fee him. It is no bad thing to have a good name at a turnpike, and e&s;pecially when a loo&s;e &s;hilling will get it. A traveller, who has heard of your, and who perhaps, has not exerci&s;ed his tongue for &s;ome time on the road, will take an op|portuity of doing it where he can,
<PB N="96" REF="95">and &s;ond of enquiries in &s;trange places, may, on pa&s;&s;ing this gate, a&s;k if Squire &s;uch a one does not live &s;omewhere about here. Oh, yes, (returns the man) his honour lives not far off. He is a worthy genetle|man. And this character is pur|cha&s;ed.&mdash; It is a pity things &s;hould be &s;o, but &s;o they are, and the old agage is too often verified. No longer pipe, no longer dance.</Q></P>

<P>FLINT had been in town a fort|night, night, and had brought an account that Mr. Ra&s;pe and his daughter had left Liverpool the day before him; but, as the Colonel had received no letter from Mi&s;s, he concluded they mu&s;t either have &s;topped at the hou&s;e of &s;ome friend in the road, or that Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe had not found an opportu|nity of giving him notice of it. He had been writing a note to Mi&s;s Trevor, to introduce him&s;elf on Dan|gle's bu&s;ine&s;s, and he di&s;patched Flint with it.&mdash;The letter was to this effect:</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="97"><Q>Colonel Ramble's be&s;t compli|ments to Mi&s;s Trevor, and having &s;omething for her private ear, &s;olicits the indulgence of half an hour's con|ver&s;ation. If agreeable, and &s;he is di&s;engaged, he will do him&s;elf the honour of paying his re&s;pects to her to-morrow at two.</Q></P>
<P>Flint, though he had travelled twenty miles this morning, was not fatigued, or our of &s;pirits; but &s;et off with his ma&s;ter's letter with alacrity, and brought him word that he had deli|vered the letter; but that Mi&s;s Trevor was not at home.</P>
<P>I can't pa&s;s, unnoticed, and accident
<PB N="99" REF="98">that happened to Flint, to &s;hew the danger and villainy of a London mob; I can &s;carce &s;uppo&s;e it the &s;ame in any metropolis but in this. Every little, unu&s;ual occurrence draws together a crowd of people to enquire into the cau&s;e, and the pickpockets take the opportunity to rob the bye-&s;tander of his pur&s;e, his watch, his handkerchief, &amp;c. Proce&s;&s;ions, a fire, a battle be|tween two men or boys, a woman faint|ing, a drunken man, an accident of any kind is &s;ufficient to call the atten|tion of a London mob, and draw the people together; and the vagabond-thieves are &s;o numerous and de&s;ti|tute as indu&s;triou&s;ly to fight pretended battles, and create incitements to
<PB N="100" REF="99">a mob, that they may have their wi&s;hed-for opportunities. Careful and cautious people are aware of this, and take pains to avoid a crowd; but the thoughtle&s;s and incon&s;iderate will ru&s;h eagerly into one, and become the ob|jects of plunder.&mdash;Flint, in his way from Lady Da&s;hit's, got into a hob|ble, that had nearly ended with much wor&s;e con&s;equences than it did. Though he had a good deal of fore&s;ight, not being well acquainted with London, he was not up to all the tricks of &s;harpers and pickpockets. He loved a bu&s;tle, and was fond of running into every crowd he met. At Charing-Cro&s;s, a drunken fellow with a pipe and tabor, had called together the
<PB N="101" REF="100">idle and the vagabonds, and a pretty &s;mart mob was collected: the&s;e are the times when thieves and pickpockets watch their opportunity to di&s;burthen tho&s;e who are encumbered with any little matters about them.&mdash;Flint was the foremo&s;t in this mob, and a fic|titious battle taking place, he took &s;ome pains to in&s;pirit the com|batants.&mdash; <Q>Well done Scarlet Jacket, &mdash;Mind your eye, Bandylegs&mdash;throw your blows in &s;treight and thick&mdash;hit him in the bread-ba&s;ket&mdash;keep him at arm's length.</Q> Such were the terms of the pugili&s;tic art in which Flint, in intimating to the combatants, was very vociferous. Whil&s;t the corporal was thus engaged,
<PB N="102" REF="101">a baker's boy ran up again&s;t his coat; Flint's, attention being thus called off, a ra&s;cal &s;tepping forward, indu&s;triou&s;ly wiped off the flour from his coast, and whi&s;pered in his car to take care of an ill-looking fellow near him, or he would lo&s;e his handker|chief. Endeavouring to &s;ave this, the fellow picked his pocket of his tobacco box; another behind him, &s;tole his cap, whil&s;t a third tread|ing down the heel of his &s;hoe, kicked it off, and thus robbed him of his filver buckle. Endeavouring to reco|ver his &s;hoe, he lo&s;t his watch, got his head broke, and narrowly e&s;caped being charged with being a pick|pocked him&s;elf, being dragged to a
<PB N="103" REF="102">hor&s;e pond and ducke. He &s;cram|bled and fought his way through the mob, as well as he could, and com|forted him&s;elf, when out of danger, with having delivered his ma&s;ter's let|ter. <Q>Arrah, by my con&s;cience, (&s;aid he) if the&s;e be your London tricks, Flint will be match for you an|other time; he will carry nothing about him, and then you may &s;teal it and welcome.</Q> There was &s;el|dom a circum&s;tance that happened to him, but he communicated it to his ma&s;ter, but this &s;tory he was afraid to tell, le&s;t he &s;hould be laughed at, and called a fool for his pains.</P>

<P>BUT, we mu&s;t not omit to relate what pa&s;&s;ed at Lady Da&s;hit's, when Flint delivered his ma&s;ter's letter.</P>
<P>Bridget had prepared her Lady to receive Tom's fir&s;t vi&s;it, who had pro|cured a &s;uit of cloaths that fitted him well; but, being unu&s;ed to a &s;word, it was frequently between his legs, and nearly throwing him down. Tom was &s;hewn up by a &s;ervant, who had received Bridget's orders to admit no one into the room, till Sir Thomas Flam was gone. This was a nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="105" REF="104">precaution, le&s;t he &s;hould be acciden|tally di&s;covered.</P>
<P>Tom was brought in a chair, and, being u&s;hered up into a room, Bridget fir&s;t gave him the meeting, with <Q>Who'll &s;ay, Tom, you do not look like a gentleman now?</Q> turning him round, and admiring him; <Q>your are Sir Thomas Flam all over!</Q>&mdash;<Q>Yes, (replies Tom) I think I know how to put cloaths on, when I have any to put on. I have been practi&s;ing that the&s;es &s;even years. Is the coa&s;t clear?</Q>&mdash;<Q>Mi&s;s Trevor (&s;he &s;aid) was ju&s;t gone out in the chariot, and her Lady was ready to receive him.</Q> Tom &s;aid his heart failed him in the
<PB N="106" REF="105">bu&s;ine&s;s; but Bridget eneouraged him with, <Q>P&s;ha! Non&s;en&s;e!&mdash;You have impudence enough upon &s;ome occa|&s;ions, and when a good fortune's at &s;take, it is worth an attempt; &s;he is tired of a &s;ingle life, and will be ea&s;ily won. Indeed, the women are <HI>all</HI> ea&s;ily won. I know the &s;ex well. The only want pre&s;&s;ing.</Q>&mdash;<Q>If that will do, (returned Tom) faith &s;he &s;hall have enough of it.</Q> Bridget then left him, to acquaint her Lady of his being there; and Tom, in the mean while, examining him&s;elf in the gla&s;s, ob&s;erved that the coat fitted him to a tee.</P>
<P>Lady Da&s;hit &s;oon entered the room,
<PB N="107" REF="106">and affected to appear confu&s;ed. Bridget was peeping behind, and Tom bowing affectedly, Lady Da&s;hit fir&s;t broke the &s;ilence, with, <Q>Your name, Sir, I under&s;tand, is Sir Thomas Flam?</Q>&mdash;<Q>Sir Thomas Flam, at your Lady&s;hip's &s;ervice;</Q> replied Tom. Lady Da&s;hit could not help noticing to her&s;elf, that he was a very gentleman-like man, and begged him to be &s;eated. Tom began: <Q>Though, Madam, I may be a &s;tranger to your Lady&s;hip, you are not &s;o to me. I have admired you frequently, and ardently wi&s;hed for an opportunity of telling you &s;o.</Q> To which Lady Da&s;hit replied, with a good deal of confu&s;ion, <Q>I &s;carce know how, Sir Thomas, to
<PB N="108" REF="107">con&s;ider this, otherwi&s;e than as a compliment, when there mu&s;t be, no doubt, a number of young ladies, in the circle of your acquaintance, that mu&s;t be noticed by you.</Q>&mdash;<Q>True, Madam, (&s;aid Tom) there are; but I hate your young ladies, boarding|&s;chool mi&s;&s;es, and novel-reading girls! When a man looks for a wife, he wi&s;hes to meet with a wo|man of &s;en&s;e and di&s;cretion; a lady, like your&s;elf, who, to elegance of per&s;on, and a &s;ufficient &s;hare of beauty, is ble&s;t with an under&s;tand|ing, to make any man happy.</Q> Dur|ing this &s;tudied &s;peech, he threw his legs and arms about, in an affected way, as if in raptures with his own
<PB N="109" REF="108">cloquence; and Bridget behind, &s;eem|ed not a little plea&s;ed with his words and manner, wondering where he learnt them. Lady Da&s;hit was cap|tivated, and affecting a ba&s;hful con|fu&s;ion, replied, <Q>Your compliments, Sir, quite confu&s;e me. Pray, Sir Thomas, are you acquainted with the Vava&s;ors of York&s;hire? I hear your e&s;tate lies in that county.</Q> During all this time, Bridget indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly came backwards and forwards, under a pretence of adju&s;ting the room. Tom, rather he&s;itating, cried, <Q>Oh! yes, Madam.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Has the old gen|tlemen (&s;aid Lady Da&s;hit) got rid of his lamene&s;s?</Q> Tom, not being prepared for this, and at a lo&s;s, could
<PB N="110" REF="109">only &s;ay, "Madam?" Lady Da&s;hit went on: <Q>His &s;ciatica has been a trouble&s;ome companion to him.</Q> Tom, not knowing the meaning of the word, and, &s;uppo&s;ing it be his wife, replied, <Q>I have not the honour of knowing the lady.</Q>&mdash;"What lady?" retorts Lady Da&s;hit. Tom an&s;wered, "Mrs. Sciatica."&mdash;"Mrs. Sciatica!" explains Lady Da&s;hit, with &s;urprize; <Q>&mdash;Sciatica, Sir, is the hip-gout, with which Sir Walter has been long af|flicted.</Q> Tom, recovering him&s;elf, with an affected &s;mile, replies, <Q>I thoroughly under&s;tand what your Lady&s;hip means by &s;ciatica: it is, I &s;ay, an attendant, which, ble&s;s my &s;tars, I never had the honor of being ac|quainted
<PB N="111" REF="110">with;</Q> rejoicing that he had brought him&s;elf off &s;o well. Lady Da&s;hit did not rightly enter into this, and &s;aid, with a kind of &s;arca&s;tic &s;neer, <Q>I don't apprehend, Sir Thomas, you are acquainted with any of the family.</Q> Tom &s;aid, <Q>Not I, in|deed.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Then, why, (returned Lady Da&s;hit) did you &s;ay you was?</Q>&mdash;<Q>Pardon me, Madam, (an&s;wered Tom) I under&s;tood your Lady&s;hip a&s;ked me whether my e&s;tate lay in York&s;hire; it was to this I an&s;wered Yes.</Q>&mdash;<Q>I mu&s;t entreat your excu&s;e then, Sir Thomas, (&s;ays Lady Da&s;hit); in what part of York&s;hire does it lie?</Q> Tom, no le&s;s confu&s;ed, and at a greater lo&s;s, than before, cries again,
<PB N="112" REF="111"><Q>Ma'am?</Q>&mdash;<Q>Near what town, (con|tinued Lady Da&s;hit) for I am well acquainted with all the ridings!</Q> <Q>The devil ride her,</Q> &s;aid Tom, to him&s;elf, turning his head, and whi&s;|pering to Bridget, unob&s;erved by her mi&s;tre&s;s, <Q>Where does this e&s;tate of mine lie?</Q>&mdash;<Q>Any where near <HI>Thir&s;k?</HI></Q> continues Lady Da&s;hit. Bridget, at a lo&s;s, whi&s;pers to Tom, <Q>Say, not a great way from York.</Q>&mdash;<Q>A little off one &s;ide York,</Q> (&s;ays Tom to Lady Da&s;hit.) <Q>Thir&s;k, (replied &s;he) is not many miles from the city.</Q> Tom, &s;till embarra&s;&s;ed, &s;tammers out, <Q>True, Ma'am; true, Ma'am; but my lands are on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the city, where I
<PB N="113" REF="112">&s;hall be proud of conducting Lady Da&s;hit, and putting her in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them. Do, my dear Madam, let me hope I may, ere long, have the happine&s;s to call you mine.</Q> Bridget, fidgeting about the room, and not lik|ing this dull conver&s;ation, contrived to draw near, and whi&s;per him in his ear. <Q>Why don't you kneel at her feet, and ki&s;s her hand?</Q> It may appear a little extraordinary, that, upon &s;uch an interview, Lady Da&s;hit &s;hould not be more particular, with re&s;pect to her maid's being pre&s;ent; but, when it is con&s;idered, that her maid was her con&s;idante, of cour&s;e in the &s;ecret, and had been the means of introducing Sir Thomas there, and when we con&s;ider
<PB N="114" REF="113">that Lady Da&s;hit had a blind &s;ide, and wore a gla&s;s eye, and Bridget kept on that &s;ide of her, it is not to be won|dered at. Lady Da&s;hit did not notice Bridget, being attentive only to her own intere&s;t. <Q>I pre&s;ume, (&s;aid &s;he) Sir Thomas, you know what fortune I am po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of?</Q> (<HI>That</HI> I do, &s;aid he to him&s;elf; but, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to her Lady&s;hip) <Q>Fortune, Madam, is not the question. He, would ill de&s;erve your Lady&s;hip, who thought of your fortune. I have a very ample one, which I &s;hall be proud to &s;hare with you. Your dear &s;elf is the object of my adora|tion. Suffer me to throw my&s;elf at your feet; and &s;ay, could I once
<PB N="115" REF="114">have the honour of calling you Lady Flam, I &s;hould be the happie&s;t of men.</Q> Upon this he threw him&s;elf upon his knee, &s;eized her hand with ardour, pre&s;&s;ed it to his lips, and ki&s;&s;ed it with fervour. Lady Da&s;hit now af|fected a girli&s;h confu&s;ion, ro&s;e from her &s;eat, begged him to ri&s;e, uttering with difficulty. <Q>To &s;ay, Sir, I am not flattered with your liberality of &s;entiment, would be telling an un|truth. I am, and &s;hall be, glad to &s;ee you again at your lei&s;ure; at which time I may be more explicit." Give me leave, (&s;aid Tom, in rap|tures) to ki&s;s your hand;</Q> and whil&s;t &s;o doing, Flint hurried into the room, and di&s;covering Tom, though
<PB N="116" REF="115">in a new character, was &s;truck mo|tionle&s;s with &s;urpri&s;e. Let us dwell a little on the mortification of this &s;cene. In the very moment that Bridget and Tom were conceiving them&s;elves in their coaches, that this fellow &s;hould blunder in, and break down all their chimeras. He in&s;tantly &s;aw through the &s;cheme laid for Lady Da&s;hit; &s;poke not a word, but, with a look of hone&s;t indignation, told Tom '<HI>twas at an end.</HI></P>

<P>RAMBLE had directed Flint, if po&s;&s;ible, to deliver his letter into Mi&s;s Trevor's hands; which he might do, by a&s;king for her maid. For he was apprehen&s;ive, from what he had heard of Lady Da&s;hit, if it fell in her way, Mi&s;s Trevor might not receive it. To this end, Flint having knocked at the door, a&s;ked for Mrs. Bridget; "What do you want with her?" &s;aid the porter, who opened it, <Q>What do I want with her? (return|ed Flint) to be &s;ure I don't want her.&mdash;I have a little bit of a letter
<PB N="118" REF="117">here for here lady.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Some peti|tion, I &s;uppo&s;e, or begging letter;</Q> &s;aid the porter; (for the ladies were very charitably di&s;po&s;ed) <Q>we have been pe&s;tered with too may of <HI>them</HI> to-day already.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Peteetion! (cries Flint, rai&s;ing his voice) What, does the ra&s;cal take me for a pauper?&mdash; Look in my cap, you teef, (point|ing to his cockade) and you'll &s;ee I carry the badge of a jontleman.</Q> <Q>Jontleman!</Q> returns the &s;ervant, imitating Flint's brogue, <Q>a pretty &s;ort a gentleman-like badge truly. Now the war's over, we &s;hall be over-run with &s;uch &s;orry kind of gentlemen. Every idle vagabond, who has neither hou&s;e nor habita|tion,
<PB N="119" REF="118">trade nor profe&s;&s;ion, calls him|&s;elf a gentleman. Go, &s;et off,&mdash;you'll get nothing here.</Q> Flint's pride was now rou&s;ed, and he roared out, <Q>Hear me, fellow;&mdash;a cockade now is the highe&s;t badge of di&s;tenction. What would my little country have been but for tho&s;e who wore cock|ades? I am a &s;oldier, and a &s;oldier is a gentleman all the world over. And what is more, you poltroon, I bear about me the honourable marks of war; and am therefore not to be talked to by &s;uch a &s;naking in&s;ig|nificant ting as you. I wi&s;h I had you at Trincomalee.</Q> And at his he &s;hook his cudgel over the fellow's head. <Q>Shew me to your Lady im|madiately,

<P>The in&s;tant Bridget &s;aw Flint, &s;he ran up to him, and took him out of the room; and Tom took that oppor|tunity of taking his leave; but with a further invitation to wait on Lady Da&s;hit again. Bridget no &s;ooner got him out of the room, than &s;he &s;colded
<PB N="121" REF="120">him for coming up &s;tairs, and a&s;ked what he wanted? <Q>What do I want, Mai&s;tre&s;s?

(replied Flint) Why, I might have done that, and &s;aved my&s;elf the trouble of bringing it.&mdash; I can carry it back again, and &s;end it now, if that be all.</Q>&mdash;<Q>No, no. fool, (&s;ays Bridget) now you <HI>have</HI> brought it, you may give it to me. Mi&s;s Trevor is not at home, when &s;he returns, I will give it her. So you may go,</Q> taking him by the &s;houlder, and putting him out. <Q>Well, (returns Flint) don't &s;hove
<PB N="122" REF="121">me. I think I know that jontleman in the next room: give me leave to &s;peak to him. Though he's as fine as a jay, and looks like a flag&s;taff on the king's birth-day, I have &s;een him in a coar&s;er garb.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Hold your &s;illy tongue. (replied Bridget) You know him? How &s;hould <HI>you</HI> know him? That's Sir Thomas Flam, a gentleman that's going to be married to my old Lady;&mdash;but this is a &s;ecret.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Sir Thomas Flam!</Q> exclaims Flint, &s;neering; and in going out, but not &s;o loud as to be heard, <Q>A pretty Flam, upon my con|&s;ience!

<PB N="123" REF="122">from my Mai&s;ter, Colonel Ramble, and that little Flint brought it.</Q></P>
<P>When Tom had taken his leave, and Flint was gone, Lady Da&s;hit rung for her maid, enquired who Flint was, and how he came to be admitted; for which the Porter got a good &s;colding, not only from his Lady, but from Bridget. <Q>Well, my Lady, (&s;ays the latter) how does your Lady&s;hip like Sir Thomas? Is he not a very ele|gant, &s;ine &s;poken gentleman? He told me, on going out, that he was all in raptures with your Lady&s;hip.</Q> Lady Da&s;hit ob&s;erving to her that he was a good deal at a lo&s;s about the &s;ituation of his country &s;eat, <Q>I &s;hould

<P>MISS Trevor having &s;ent Ramble an an&s;wer, upon her return home, that &s;he &s;hould be happy to &s;ee him; he waited on her the next morning, and was no &s;ooner announed, than Mi&s;s Trevor told her maid, that Co|lonel Ramble waited on her, at his own reque&s;t, begging her private ear for
<PB N="126" REF="125">half an hour, on bu&s;ine&s;s of moment. <Q>Mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly, Mi&s;s, (&s;aid Bridget) will my words come to pa&s;s.

<PB N="133" REF="132">to an i&s;&s;ue, he told her, he would not tre&s;pa&s;s longer upon her patience, but take the liberty at once to &s;olicit her hand and heart in favour of one who adored her, and could not live without her. <Q>My heart, (replied &s;he) is too poor an object to make much parade of; it is a trifling, &s;illy thing, that &s;carce knows its own in|tere&s;ts; and, I fear, of too little con&s;equence to be worth any one's notice.</Q> <Q>It is, I am convinced, (an&s;wered Ramble) a heart that every &s;en&s;ible man would be am|bitious of obtaining; and, I hone&s;tly declare to you, that I never thought my friend Dangle a man of under|&s;tanding till now</Q> Mi&s;s Trevor,
<PB N="134" REF="133">till this in&s;tant, was not undeceived in her hopes but that the Colonel was addre&s;&s;ing her for him&s;elf; and, of cour&s;e, te&s;tified her &s;urpri&s;e at the name of Dangle. Ramble proceeded: <Q>My dear Mi&s;s Trevor, Dangle has long loved you, and often wi&s;hed to declare it, but a cur&s;ed <HI>mauvai&s;e honte,</HI> which he cannot get the bet|ter of, has prevented his &s;aying what he has reque&s;ted me to &s;ay for him. Will you give me leave to tell him that you will receive his addre&s;|&s;es? Believe me, you cannot coun|tenance a more hone&s;t fellow, nor one that will make a better hu&s;|band.</Q> Mi&s;s Trevor, now betray|ing more &s;urpri&s;e, and &s;ome marks of
<PB N="135" REF="134">di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;aid, <Q>So, Sir, it is Mr. <HI>Dangle</HI>'s cau&s;e that you have been pleading all this time?</Q> <Q>Even &s;o, Madam, (an&s;wered he) the cau&s;e of friend&s;hip and of love.</Q> <Q>Then, (&s;aid &s;he) I mu&s;t be under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of telling you, that you have been fruitle&s;sly employed. I am not in&s;en&s;ible of the honour Mr. Dangle does me; but my heart has <HI>unfortu|nately</HI> been long engaged to another. (here &s;he &s;ighed) Mr. Dangle is a gentleman I &s;hall ever re&s;pect as a <HI>friend,</HI> but the la&s;t man in the world I could bring my&s;elf to think of as a <HI>hu&s;band.</HI></Q> <Q>But are you &s;erious in this?</Q> returned Ramble.&mdash;<Q>Quite &s;erious,</Q> &s;aid &s;he.&mdash;Ramble added,
<PB N="136" REF="135">he hoped he had not di&s;plea&s;ed her by the part he had taken. <Q>I &s;hould have been much better plea&s;ed, (re|plied Mi&s;s Trevor) had you taken up le&s;s of my time upon the occa|&s;ion.</Q> With this &s;he got up, and rung the bell. Ramble, &s;eeing he had given offence, and, unhappy at the circum&s;tance, &s;aid, taking her by the hand, <Q>Come, Mi&s;s Trevor, it was an act of friend&s;hip;&mdash;you mu&s;t for|give me, and if ever I undertake &s;uch another jobb, the devil fetch me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It might, (&s;aid &s;he) be an act of friend&s;hip to <HI>him,</HI> but it &s;urely could be none to <HI>me;</HI> however, Sir, on

Ramble felt him&s;elf much hurt at this;&mdash;his good-nature, and readi|ne&s;s to oblige his friend, had cau&s;ed him to offend a lady he really re|&s;pected; and various were the &s;ugge&s;|tions that immediately &s;truck him. He could not but dwell on the charms

<P>RAMBLE, as I have ob&s;erved, found him&s;elf much embarra&s;&s;ed in the affair with Mi&s;s Trevor. Indeed his &s;entiments differed &s;o widely from the generality of young men, as to be &s;u&s;|ceptible of many inquietudes they ne|ver know. He &s;pent &s;ome hours, one morning, in his &s;tudy, contemplating
<PB N="139" REF="138">this bu&s;ine&s;s; and thus it was he rea|&s;oned with him&s;elf: "What is it, (&s;aid he) that &s;o di&s;turbs me? I undertook to plead for my friend, in behalf of his affection for Mi&s;s Trevor.&mdash;When I found my own heart intere&s;ted, did I betray my friend?&mdash;No,&mdash;but as warm|ly urged his &s;uit, as if it had been my own.&mdash;Would &s;he hear me?&mdash;No,&mdash;but took offence; and would only forgive it on condition that the &s;ubject never was renewed; with a po&s;itive declara|tion, that &s;he never would admit Dangle's &s;uit.&mdash;Was I not then at li|berty to have pleaded for my&s;elf?&mdash;Yes; and thou&s;ands would have done it, had they felt, like me, the powerful influence of her charms.&mdash;How unfor|tunate,
<PB N="140" REF="139">that he &s;hould have applied to me, who am now, perhaps, much more her &s;lave than ever he was!&mdash;Her manner, I think, was &s;ingular:&mdash;She appeared &s;en&s;ibly touched with my di&s;cour&s;e.&mdash;What did &s;he mean by <HI>unfortunately</HI> engaged? &mdash; To whom could that be?&mdash;But, what am I about? (throwing him&s;elf upon his &s;ofa) Do I already forget the promi&s;es I made Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe?&mdash;Unlucky, cruel hour, that linked me to this chain of trouble!&mdash;In which am I mo&s;t ju&s;ti|fiable?&mdash;Is that man a man of honour, who &s;hall rob a parent of his child?&mdash;Will my faith to Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe compen|&s;ate for the injury done to her father, who builds all his hopes on marrying
<PB N="141" REF="140">her to a nobleman?&mdash;Will not this in|ju&s;tice to <HI>him,</HI> ca&s;t a &s;hade upon <HI>my</HI> honour?&mdash;Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe may have, and may yet meet, many a better offer; avoid offending her parent, and pre|vent my doing him an inju&s;tice.&mdash;Mi&s;s Trevor is independant; and, with a good fortune, enjoys the di&s;po&s;al, not only of that, but of her per&s;on;&mdash;and, was I to marry her, I &s;hould have no feelings to wound,&mdash;no remor&s;e to &s;ting me.&mdash;What, not the reproaches of a friend?&mdash;Have <HI>the&s;e</HI> no poignancy?&mdash;They have.&mdash;Mi&s;s Trevor will not hear him; of cour&s;e, treachery it cannot be.&mdash;But, have I once dwelt on that, which reflects di&s;honour, more than all the re&s;t?&mdash;Have I con&s;idered the pains
<PB N="142" REF="141">I took to win a heart, I now &s;eem &s;o willing to re&s;ign?&mdash;Was I happy till I had made Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe confe&s;s her at|tachment to me?&mdash;What a mon&s;ter, an ingrate, mu&s;t I then be to forget my&s;elf, and the vows I made her?"&mdash;</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant Spatter &s;tole into the room, with <Q>What, a&s;leep, Ramble, in the middle of the day, or mu|&s;ing?</Q>&mdash;Ramble, too ab&s;orbed. in thought to ob&s;erve him, ro&s;e from the &s;ofa, and went on: &mdash; "How the&s;e reflections wound me! &mdash; What pity is due to tho&s;e who feel as I do!&mdash;Many a man there is, who would glory in &s;uch difficulties.&mdash;Such men may &s;uffer le&s;s; but &s;uch men I de&s;pi&s;e.&mdash;Shall
<PB N="143" REF="142">I, then, act in &s;uch a manner, as..." He was proceeding in this &s;train as Spatter approached him, but &s;till lo&s;t in thought, and turning, as he uttered the la&s;t word, unthinkingly, round, his face met Spatters; who, crying "No," aloud, as an&s;wering to his que&s;|tion, &s;tartled him, and put an end to his reveries. <Q>Where did you hide your&s;elf?</Q> &s;aid he to Spatter. <Q>I have been here this half hour, (re|plied he) and have heard your whole &s;oliloquy.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I am &s;orry for it, (&s;aid Ramble).&mdash;You then can, perhaps, advi&s;e me?</Q> <Q>Not I, believe me. (&s;aid he) I have heard a great deal, but could make
<PB N="144" REF="143">little out.</Q> <Q>Know then, (conti|nued Ramble) I have been pleading Dangle's cau&s;e with a fine girl, and an fallen de&s;perately in love with her my&s;elf. Though &s;he has ab&s;o|lutely rejected his &s;uit, my refined notions of honour forbid me to make any advances for my&s;elf.</Q> Spatter a&s;ked who the girl was; and on Ram|ble's &s;aying he was not at liberty to name her, added, <Q>Let her be who &s;he will, you may be very ea&s;y on that &s;core; for Dangle's too fa|&s;hionable a lover to think of a wife. Had you obtained the girl's con&s;ent, he would have been much more em|barra&s;&s;ed and chagrined than he will now, on being made acquainted with
<PB N="145" REF="144">her refu&s;al.</Q> This &s;urpri&s;ed Ramble, and he begged Spatter would be more explicit. <Q>His vanity (he continued) is in&s;upportable. In the cour&s;e of his life he has not courted le&s;s than fifty women; whom, as &s;oon as he di&s;covered that he was likely to &s;uc|ceed with, he has ab&s;olutely jilted. Was you to tell him that his appli|cation has been unattended to, he would be eager to renew it; but, tell him he may have her, and &s;he may be mine, or your's or any man's.</Q> <Q>You certainly cannot be &s;erious;</Q> replied Ramble. <Q>Only try the ex|periment,</Q> &s;aid Spatter. Ramble &s;aid it would be telling an untruth, which he never could do.&mdash; <Q>Not to
<PB N="146" REF="145">your&s;elf?</Q> replied Spatter. <Q>No, not to &s;erve a <HI>friend,</HI> (returned Ram|ble) whom I would &s;erve <HI>before</HI> my|&s;elf.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Tell me (&s;aid Spatter) the girl's name, and I'll undertake it for you:&mdash;Mi&s;s Seabright? Lady Bab Squeami&s;h? Mi&s;s Gadabout? Mi&s;s Trevor? Mi&s;s&mdash;</Q> <Q>It is in vain (&s;aid Ramble) to per&s;i&s;t; was you to name the whole town, it would not do.</Q>&mdash;<Q>What will you &s;ay now (adds Spatter) if I tell the untruth for you, and bring Dangle to relinqui&s;h her?</Q>&mdash;<Q>Say? (re|turns Ramble, laughing) &s;ay you can gulp down a lie better than I can.</Q> <Q>You don't de&s;erve my good offices, (replied Spatter) but, as I &s;hall have
<PB N="147" REF="146">laugh at Dangle's expence, I'll &s;et about it.</Q> No &s;ooner were the words uttered, than Dangle entered the room: Spatter runs up to him, with <Q>I was flying to you, Dangle with joy|ful tidings. Some girl, Ramble &s;ays, to whom he has been &s;peaking in your favour, con&s;ents to make you happy; you have only to buy a licen&s;e and fix the day.</Q>&mdash;<Q>I hope (&s;ays Dangle to Ramble) you have not betrayed me?</Q>&mdash;<Q>Not I, upon my honour, (returned he) Spatter has tried all he could, to learn her name, but he is &s;till in the dark.</Q>&mdash;<Q>That's true enough, (cried Spatter) ban|tering him, for I would give all the world to know; that I might have
<PB N="148" REF="147">the happine&s;s of paying my re&s;pects to Mrs. Dangle, that is to be.</Q> Dangle already repented matters had gone &s;o far, and began con&s;idering how he &s;hould get off with Ramble; for after all, <Q>he'd be curs'd (he &s;aid) if he could tune his mind to matri|mony. And a&s;ked Ramble, whe|ther Spatter was not je&s;ting?</Q>&mdash;<Q>You mu&s;t have a bad opinion of my oratory, (replied he) if you doubt its &s;ucce&s;s.</Q>&mdash;<Q>To be plain with you, Ramble, (returned Dangle, &s;omewhat embarra&s;&s;ed) I could not conceive you would have been &s;o expeditious, and the de&s;ign of this vi&s;it was to reque&s;t you to defer the matter till I had recon&s;idered it.</Q>
<PB N="149" REF="148">Spatter, with a kind of triumph, whi&s;pered Ramble, <Q>Am I right now or not?</Q> Ramble addre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf to Dangle with &s;ome warmth, and exclaimed, <Q>recon&s;idered it!&mdash; Hearkee, Dangle;&mdash;when you wi&s;h to trifle with a lady again, I beg you will not make me your in&s;trument. I hope I &s;hall never meet you at that hou&s;e any more.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Nay, (retorted Dangle) if you are &s;o warm upon the occa&s;ion, I mu&s;t tell you, that until you are ma&s;ter of that hou&s;e, or till the ladies refu&s;e to &s;ee me, I &s;hall go there when I plea&s;e;&mdash;I &s;ee no rea&s;on, Colonel Ramble, for this anger.</Q>&mdash;<Q>I don't wi&s;h to prevent your going there, (&s;aid Ramble) all
<PB N="150" REF="149">I hope is, that I may never meet you there; as I &s;hould not only blu&s;h for my&s;elf, but for <HI>you.</HI> I am not unacquainted, Dangle, with your ridiculous vanity, and that this circum&s;tance may not add to your trophies, be a&s;&s;ured, Sir, that the lady, peremptorily refu&s;ed to li&s;ten to any thing I had to &s;ay re&s;pecting you. You once upon a time told me, you would not &s;uffer her cha|racter to be trified with, this is trifling with it with a vengeance.</Q> Dangle a&s;ked him warmly, whether he meant to in&s;inuate any thing to his di&s;advantage? <Q>Mo&s;t certainly, (re|turned Ramble) I do, and mu&s;t ac|quaint you, before your friend Spat|ter,
<PB N="151" REF="150">that your behaviour in this mat|ter, has been what I did not expect; it was ungenerous in you to employ me before you knew your own mind.</Q> Nay, Gentlemen (inter|rupted Spatter, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf fir&s;t to one and then to the other,? <Q>Co|lonel Ramble, Mr. Dangle,&mdash;this is making a laughable matter too &s;e|rious.</Q>&mdash;<Q>It is no laughable matter, (re&s;umed the Colonel;) I mean to take it up very &s;eriou&s;ly.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Then, if it offends you, (&s;aid Dangle) you know your remedy; I &s;hall be at home the whole of the day, and wait your commands,</Q> And upon this left them. <Q>Upon my &s;oul, Ramble, (&s;aid Spatter) I am &s;orry
<PB N="152" REF="151">for this, you have carried this affair &s;o far, that I fear you cannot refrain from calling him out.</Q>&mdash;<Q>He may than <HI>you</HI> for it, (returned he) for had you not laid open his folly to me, all would have been well. I &s;hould have acquainted him with the re&s;ult of my emba&s;&s;y, and things would have re&s;ted there.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Nay, (&s;aid Spatter) I did it to put you at ea&s;e; I hope, however, matters may yet be honourably adju&s;ted, without com|ing to extremities.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Your ideas of honour, and mine, Spatter, (&s;aid he) &s;eem to be widely different; I have had the &s;atisfaction of telling him openly my &s;entiments of his conduct, and if they anger him, he

<PB N="154" REF="153">be a&s;hamed of his behaviour, and I'll take care to let his friends know that his propo&s;al has been rejected; don't I merit now your confidence for this? Come, tell me her name, it &s;hall go no further, upon my &s;oul it &s;han't.</Q>&mdash;<Q>No, (&s;aid Ramble) that would be &s;o like taking revenge; be|&s;ides, as I know you hate to be bur|thened with &s;ecrets, I will not trou|ble you with this.</Q></P>

<P>RAMBLE finding a want of money, and learning that he was in|debted to Mi&s;s Trevor for his relea&s;e, thought it nece&s;&s;ary to apply to &s;ome per&s;on capable of accommodating him with the loan of 1000l. He was re|commended to Grumble, the attorney, as a man in the habit of accommo|dating gentlement with money. He went to this man's hou&s;e, and found him &s;eated in an ea&s;y chair, with his leg wrapped up, and re&s;ted on a &s;tool as having the gout. Ramble ac|quainted him with this bu&s;ine&s;s, and produced a mortgage-deed of an e&s;tate
<PB N="156" REF="155">of 500l. a year, on which his father had lent a neighbour 2000l. Grumble looking on the parchment, &s;aid, <Q>he deemed it &s;ufficient, and was happy in an opportunity of letting <HI>him</HI> have the money immediately; as a friend of his, a merchant of Liverpool, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s he did in the money-way, was ju&s;t arrived with a parcel, and had been with him to enquire whe|ther he could di&s;po&s;e of any of it to advantage, and on his telling him he could, was gone to fetch it. He is a man (continued Grumble) that I do a great deal of bu&s;ine&s;s for, and loving his money as his life, would not em|ploy me, if he did not think him&s;elf &s;afe in my hands; I have, in my time
<PB N="157" REF="156">done many a &s;core thou&s;and for him; he is one of the riche&s;t men in Li|verpool. Indeed I wonder he pro&s;|pers &s;o well, con&s;idering the traffic he is engaged in, that of bartering for human &s;le&s;h.</Q>&mdash;<Q>I think (&s;aid Ramble) I know the man.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Not unlikely (returned Grumble) his name is Ra&s;pe.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Has not he an only child, and daughter?</Q>&mdash;<Q>He has, and &s;he is in town with him. As I find you know &s;omething of him, I can bring you together. I expect his return every minute.</Q> Ramble begged to be excu&s;ed from this, &s;aying, <Q>Though he knows my family, I think it would be better not to mention my name, le&s;t he &s;hould
<PB N="158" REF="157">&s;tart &s;ome objections; for he is a very whin &s;ical man.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Well, well, (&s;aid Grumble) there is no occa&s;ion to mention names, for he always re&s;ts &s;atisfied with me.</Q> Scarce were the&s;e words uttered, when Grumble's clerk entered the room and &s;aid, Mr. Ra&s;pe was without and a young lady with him. Ramble begged leave to retire into the next room. He no &s;ooner had retired, than Mr. Ra&s;pe and his daughter entered. <Q>Nothing but gout here, (&s;aid Ra&s;pe) perhaps it is catching. I am afraid to come in. I &s;uppo&s;e your clerk's got the gout too; he was &s;o long delivering the me&s;&s;age;&mdash;he kept me half an hour waiting, and was at la&s;t forced
<PB N="159" REF="158">to come in without introduction.</Q>&mdash;<Q>I can't get up, (&s;aid Grumble) you mu&s;t excu&s;e me.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Old &s;ins, Ma&s;ter Grumble (returned Ra&s;pe) old &s;ins,&mdash;(gout follows clo&s;e.)&mdash;I have brought the money, di&s;patch me as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible: I have but little time to &s;pare.</Q>&mdash;<Q>I pre&s;ume (&s;aid Grumble) that young lady is your daughter.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Yes, (an&s;wered Ra&s;pe) &s;he is my daughter; I al|ways take her with me; good for|tunes are &s;oon run away with; I therefore never lo&s;e &s;ight of her.</Q> Grumble begged them to be &s;eated, but no chairs being in the room, ex|cept the one he &s;at in, nothing but two high de&s;k-&s;tools, Ra&s;pe, who was a &s;hort
<PB N="160" REF="159">man &s;aid, <Q>he could not reach the &s;tool.</Q> Grumble reque&s;ted Mi&s;s to ring the bell, &s;aying, <Q>his clerk &s;hould fetch one out of the next room.</Q>&mdash;<Q>No, no, (returned Ra&s;pe)  he'll be a long time about it,</Q> and turning to his daughter, bad her fetch one. Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe going into the next room to fetch a chair, di&s;covered Ram|ble. She flew into his arms with joy and &s;urpri&s;e, and meeting him where &s;he &s;o little expected it, almo&s;t overcome her. She had not time then to &s;peak to him, but took a chair and faid &s;he would contrive to return. Upon her entering the room where her father was, &s;he found him and his attorney engaged in bu&s;ine&s;s. Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe interrupted
<PB N="161" REF="160">them, by ob&s;erving to Mr. Grumble, what a fine collection of pictures he had, and with his leave, whil&s;t they were adju&s;ting their bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;he would go and look and them. <Q>Aye, aye, (&s;aid Ra&s;pe) Charlotte loves paintings; her father hates them.</Q> Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe went into the next room again, fa&s;tening the door after her. She now told the Colonel, <Q>that they had been in London more than a week, that &s;he had unfortunately lo&s;t the directions he had given her, and was quite unhappy on the account of it; and con&s;idered this accidental meet|ing  as an act of Providence.</Q> She acquainted Ramble, that it would be &s;till &s;ome weeks before they &s;hould &s;et
<PB N="162" REF="161">off for Paris; that they were at her un|cle's, Sir Raby Ra&s;pe's, and &s;hould there continue whil&s;t in London; got a direc|tion where to convey a letter to the Colonel, and a&s;&s;ured him &s;he would contrive &s;ome method of &s;eeing him in a day or two, and would let him know it by a line, and was &s;orry the time &s;uppo&s;ed for looking over a few pictures would not admit of her &s;aying more to him at pre&s;ent. Her father, in the next room, upon Grumble's a&s;&s;uring him his daughter was a fine girl, and that he could not be too careful of her, told him he had &s;ent her to Scotland to be out of the way of the men; that he went a month &s;ince to fetch her, and found a damned red-coated fellow
<PB N="163" REF="162">under the &s;ame roof, a man whom they called Coloned Ramble, that he brought her away ju&s;t in the nick of time, that a day longer would have lo&s;t her, that he left her fellow behind, that, thank Heaven, he had nothing to fear now; as the was going to take her abroad, and would not &s;ee her again in a hurry. Grumble, who was convinced now that the red-coated fellow alluded to, could only be Colonel Ramble in the next room, &s;eemed to enjoy the thought of the young couple meeting &s;o opportunely. He had, in his days been of an intriguing di&s;po&s;ition him|&s;elf, was mortified to find that age and infirmity put a &s;top to his career. He therefore prolonged the conver&s;ation
<PB N="164" REF="163">as much as he could, to give the Colo|nel more time to &s;pend with Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe.

The Colonel now re-entered to Grumble, got from him the ca&s;h, and an account of what pa&s;&s;ed between him and Ra&s;pe; was not a little plea&s;ed with the acci|dent

Lady Di, who took a pride in
<PB N="172" REF="171">mortifying tho&s;e &s;he had under her command, and happy in laughing, at the expence of her dependents, ap|plauded her de&s;ign, and promi&s;ed to lend her one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful books in her library. It was a French and Engli&s;h Dictionary. Some days after, her lady&s;hip a&s;ked Mi&s;s Sneak how &s;he liked the book.

<P>Flint could not have been &s;ent on a

<P>RAMBLE now received a letter from Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe, &s;aying, that her father was determined to &s;et out as the next day for Paris. That he had kept her in the dark till about two hours ago; that &s;he had tried various means to prevail on him to &s;tay a few days longer, but nothing would do; till at la&s;t &s;he could only gain one day, in order to have her teeth &s;et to rights
<PB N="186" REF="185">by a denti&s;t, which &s;he thought a very nece&s;&s;ary &s;tep, as they might not have &s;o good an opportunity again, between London and Florence; that this had effected the bu&s;ine&s;s, that he had con|&s;ented to her &s;ending for a denti&s;t the next morning, and would &s;tay a day longer on that account. She wi&s;hed the Colonel would therefore di&s;gui&s;e him&s;elf as a denti&s;t, per&s;onate an old Frenchman, &s;peaking broken En|gli&s;h, introduce him&s;elf as Dr. Snag, and be with her at eleven in the morn|ing; and, &s;he flattered her&s;elf &s;he &s;hould then have an opportunity of adju&s;ting what was nece&s;&s;ary before they left London</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="186">Ramble did not very well like this &s;cheme, but the time being &s;hort, he had no alternative; he procured a &s;car|let roquelaure, a bag of in&s;truments, and type-wig, painted his face and &s;et off the next morning on this awkward piece of enterprize. When he arrived at the hou&s;e, he was introduced into the room where Mr. Ra&s;pe &s;eemed en|gaged. Ra&s;pe hearing he was a Frenchman, and concluding he could enter into no conver&s;ation, and, in|deed he was &s;o di&s;gui&s;ed as to have all the appearance of a Frenchman; rang the bell for a &s;ervant, &s;ent him for his daughter, made a motion with his hand as de&s;iring him to be &s;eated, and then proceeded on what he was about,
<PB N="188" REF="187">which &s;eemed to be reading letters, and calculating re&s;pecting the Slave-Trade; for he was talking to him&s;elf and reckoning on his fingers.

<PB N="189" REF="188">his in&s;truments down, gave her a thou|&s;and thank for this well-contrived in|terview, but feared there would be no|means of getting her away, till they reached Paris. Mi&s;s Ra&s;pe was of the &s;ame opinion, particularly as their &s;tay in London would would be &s;o &s;hort.

Had an oppor|tunity even offered, I could not have embraced it a few days ago, being in want ca&s;h; but now I am provided.
<PB N="190" REF="189">Nothing, even in love, is to be done without money; the wheels will not turn, the hor&s;es will not gallop, nor will the driver &s;tart.

Ra&s;pe's foot being heard upon the &s;tairs, &s;he unbolted the door, and Ramble put on his cloak. Ra&s;pe coming into the room, and finding he had fini&s;hed with his daughter, &s;at down, bad him look into his mouth, and &s;ee what was wanting.

Gums enflamme&eacute;s. and vil be more vour&s;e,&mdash;dey &s;hou'd be lanced.</Q> Ra&s;pe bawls out, <Q>Won't you hurt me? I can't bear pain, I am &s;ubject

<PB N="197" REF="196">were you, my lady. I wonder he has not been here, he generally keeps his time.</Q> Scarce had &s;he &s;aid the word, but a great knocking was heard, <Q>Per|haps, this is Sir Thomas, &s;hall I go and &s;ee, my lady?</Q> Con&s;ent being given, &s;he went, and Lady Da&s;hit, in the in|terim, determined to clo&s;e the bu&s;ine&s;s at once. Her words were, 'I &s;han't &s;tand &s;hilly-&s;hally upon the occa&s;ion, as girl's do.' Tom was u&s;hered in by Bridget, and, addre&s;&s;ed Lady Da&s;hit, thus.&mdash; <Q>My dear Lady Da&s;hit, I ki&s;s your hand. It &s;eems and age &s;ince I &s;aw you.</Q> Bridget was ordered by her lady to leave the room, ob&s;erving <Q>that wench would gladly have &s;taid and heard what we had to &s;ay. Cham|bermaids
<PB N="198" REF="197">the mo&s;t curious and inqui|&s;itive animals alive.</Q> <Q>They are like gentlemens valets, (cried Tom) who&s;e ma&s;ters too apt to put confidence in them, make them forward and im|pertinent; mine is too much &s;o. Well now, my dear Madam, permit me to a&s;k you, whether you have taken the matter we were talking about into con&s;ideration. I am impatient for the happy day.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Perhaps too impatient, Sir Thomas, (replied her lady&s;hip.) He that weds in ha&s;te, &s;ay, the repents at lei&s;ure.</Q>&mdash;<Q>No, man, (returns Tom) can po&s;&s;ibly re|repent giving his hand to one of Lady Da&s;hit's amiable qualifications, and....he was going on,</Q> when unfor|tunately
<PB N="199" REF="198">for him, Spatter, who had found his way into the hou&s;e, and almo&s;t into the room, was &s;topped by Bridget on the landing-place, who was heard to &s;ay, without, <Q>Indeed Mr. Spatter, you can't &s;ee my Lady now; &s;he is particularly engaged.</Q>&mdash; Spatter was al&s;o heard to &s;ay, <Q>I mu&s;t &s;ee her; for I have news of the utmo&s;t importance to acquaint her with. I &s;hall not detain her Lady&s;hip a mi|nute.</Q> He was not to be put back, and Bridget thinking if &s;he opened the door, and he &s;aw a gentleman with her, that he would naturally retire, opened it; but, on &s;o doing, &s;o far from withdrawing, he pu&s;hed right into the room; Tom &s;eeing him, drew back.
<PB N="200" REF="199"><Q>My dear Lady Da&s;hit, I beg your par|don for this intru&s;ion, but I have a matter for your private ear, that I am per&s;uaded you would wi&s;h to know.&mdash;Mi&s;s Blo&s;&s;om is</Q>...he was going on at a fine rate, but &s;eeing Tom, &s;topped &s;hort, &s;aying, <Q>I thought we had been alone; pray who is that gentleman?</Q>&mdash;<Q>A particular friend of your's, (&s;aid Lady Da&s;hit) who has done me the honour of a vi&s;it.</Q> Spatter going up to Tom, &s;aid, <Q>Sir, I am your mo&s;t obedient humble &s;ervant;</Q>&mdash;then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Lady Da&s;hit, <Q>I have not the honour to know the gentleman; but not mat|ter, what I am going to relate is no &s;ecret; 'tis only that Lord Random
<PB N="201" REF="200">has returned Mi&s;s Blo&s;&s;om, and will have nothing more to do with her.</Q> How (&s;aid Lady Da&s;hit to her&s;elf) not know him&mdash;There mu&s;t be &s;omething treacherous in this piece of bu&s;ine&s;s, or Spatter mu&s;t have told a lie; then addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to Tom, &s;aid, <Q>Mr. Spatter is an old acquaintance of your's, Sir Thomas,?</Q>&mdash;<Q>I prote&s;t, (replied Tom) I never &s;aw the gen|tleman before.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Mr. Spatter, (&s;aid Lady Da&s;hit) didn't you tell me that you was per&s;onally acquainted with Sir Thomas Flam?&mdash;That's Sir Thomas Flam.</Q> Bridget, who was all this time in the room, drew up to Tom, and took an opportunity, unno|ticed, to whi&s;per in his ear, <Q>Brazen
<PB N="202" REF="201">it out, you may be Sir Thomas Flam, or Lord Flam, for any thing he knows to the contrary.</Q> Spatter kept eying Tom all this time, and as unwilling as either of them to be found in a lie, determined to per&s;i&s;t in it, let what would be the con&s;equence, or he never &s;hould be believed again. <Q>Yes Madam, (&s;aid he to Lady Da&s;hit), I have the plea&s;ure to be per&s;onally known to him, but your lady&s;hip is joking with me now; this gentleman is no more Sir Thomas Flam, than I am Sir Thomas Flam.</Q> Tom then drew up to Spatter, angrily, &s;aying, <Q>how dare you pre&s;ume to fal&s;ify my per&s;on? You are di&s;co|vered in a barefaced lie, and now
<PB N="203" REF="202">want to bully it out; (then addre&s;|&s;ing Lady Da&s;hit,) this man's cha|racter is too well-known. He is not acquainted with one man of fa&s;hion in ten, that he boa&s;ts of being known to.</Q>&mdash;<Q>That <HI>I</HI> can take upon me to &s;ay, (whi&s;pers Bridget to her lady,) it was but the other day, he met with Lord Spangle, with whom he profe&s;|&s;ed an acquaintance for years, and yet didn't know him:</Q> (then whi&s;|pering to Tom,) <Q>threaten him, and you'll &s;oon get rid of him,</Q> and went out.</P>
<P>Spatter then addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Tom, <Q>Such language as you have u&s;ed to me, Sir, is not to be put up with.
<PB N="204" REF="203">Had I a &s;word by my &s;ide, as you have, I'd let you &s;ee the length of it.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Nothing, (replied Tom, loudly) but this lady's pre&s;ence prevents me from treating you as you de&s;erve.</Q> During the&s;e high words, who &s;hould come in but Tom's ma&s;ter, leading in Mi&s;s Trevor. Tom, thun|der&s;truck, &s;aid, <Q>My ma&s;ter here too! Now 'tis all over. They're again&s;t the door, or I'd be off.</Q> (He draws back, &s;eeking for an opportunity to e&s;cape). <Q>What's the matter, Ma'am? (&s;aid Mi&s;s Trevor) I thought I heard high words, or I would not have intruded.</Q>&mdash;<Q>It is very unpo|lite, gentlemen, (&s;aid Dangle,) to be quarrelling in the company of a
<PB N="205" REF="204">lady.</Q> Spatter ob&s;erved, it was no quarrel, only a warm debate about a matter of little con&s;equence. <Q>It may be of little con&s;equence to you, gentlemen, (&s;aid Lady Da&s;hit) but to me it is of the greate&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>Flint, having been &s;ent by his ma&s;ter, with Rattle and Saunter, to Saunter's hou&s;e, in order to bring &s;omething back; and pa&s;&s;ing by Lady Da&s;hit's where he &s;aw the chair that had brought Sir Thomas Flam before, gave the gentlemen a &s;hort account of what he knew, and wi&s;hed them to &s;tep in; they, as de&s;irous as he could be of enjoying the confu&s;ion that mu&s;t ari&s;e on the di&s;covery; knocked, and enquired if he was not there; and being
<PB N="206" REF="205">an&s;wered in the a&s;&s;irmative, &s;aid, they had bu&s;ine&s;s of con&s;equence with Lady Da&s;hit, and mu&s;t &s;ee her: accordingly they were admitted; and, the door being open, they entered the room during this &s;cene. Tom finding him&s;elf furrounded by his enemies, endeavoured to &s;lipaway, but Flint &s;topped him with, <Q> Hold fa&s;t there, honey, I mu&s;t have a little bit of talk with you, before I go.</Q> (Tom walks about as angry, hanging his head, le&s;t he &s;hould be known to his ma&s;t&egrave;r.) You are come, gentle|men, <Q>at a fortunate moment, (&s;aid Dangle) Mr. Spatter has contrived to get him&s;elf into a quarrel with a gentleman here upon a vi&s;it to Lady Da&s;hit. Swords were talked of, and,
<PB N="207" REF="206">(laughing,) had it not been for our coming in, as we did, there might have been bloody work.</Q> Mi&s;s Trevor and Lady Da&s;hit now retired to the other part of the room, conver&s;i with each other, and Saunter, who was of a &s;atyrical turn, ob&s;erved to Dangle, laughing, <Q>that if blood had been &s;hed, it would have been &s;laying the enemy without quarter, which, in my opimon, (&s;aid he) is murder; for Spatter, I'll be &s;worn, would have made no re|&s;i&s;tance but with his tongue; and as a coward cannot be an hone&s;t man, there mu&s;t have been &s;ome foul play in Spatter.</Q> Dangle going up to Tom, addre&s;&s;es him with, <Q>As a &s;tranger, Sir,&mdash;(Here he &s;topped
<PB N="208" REF="207">for he did not di&s;cover him till this mo|ment) How's this? (cried he) my varlet of a &s;ervant dre&s;&s;ed up in the habit of a gentleman?</Q> This was heard by the whole company. Flint an&s;wered him, <Q>Yes your honour. He was retreating, but little Flint &s;topped him.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Detain him, (&s;aid Dangle) a little longer.</Q> Flint accordingly put him back, takes his &s;word from him, and mounts guard, as it were, over him. <Q>Mr. Dangle's &s;ervant! (exclaims Lady Da&s;hit, then have I been duped indeed. He pa&s;&s;ed him&s;elf on me, (&s;aid &s;he to Dangle) for a York&s;hire baronet.</Q>&mdash;<Q>So I find, (retunred Rattle) We learned the greate&s;t part of what pa&s;&s;ed before we came in;
<PB N="209" REF="208">for Flint di&s;covered him the la&s;t vi&s;it he made to your lady&s;hip, and came now with us to acquaint you with it.</Q> <Q>Spatter's right for once, (&s;aid Rattle) in not knowing him to be Sir Tho|mas Flam.</Q> At this Spatter began to triumph, &s;aying, <Q>and yet I could not obtain credit!</Q>&mdash;<Q>Nay, returns Saunter) don't boa&s;t of your veracity; I'll appeal to Rattle, did not you tell me this morning, Rattle, of a conver|&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed between you and Spatter, re&s;pecting an embarra&s;&s;ment he was under here, in inadvertently, as he was plea&s;ed to term it, a&s;&s;ert|ing to Lady Da&s;hit, that he was per|&s;onally acquainted with Sir Thomas Flam, when he was con&s;cious there
<PB N="210" REF="209">was con&s;cious there was no &s;uch man exi&s;ting?</Q>&mdash;<Q>I did, (an&s;wered Rattle) and am happy in being here to confront him.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Per&s;idious man! (exclaimed Lady Da&s;hit) but I de&s;erve it.</Q>&mdash;<Q>With what pro|priety, (&s;aid Dangle to Spatter) can you expect to gain credit, when your whole life is made up of lies and de|ceit? My incautious di&s;po&s;ition led me, as it has done others, to entertain a favourable opinion of you. But you have always repre&s;ented me as a man without re&s;olution. True enought, I wanted re&s;olution to drop <HI>you.</HI> I have at la&s;t found you out, and pronounce you to be a hypocri|tical,
<PB N="211" REF="210">go&s;&s;iping liar; a mi&s;chief|maker in families; the bane of &s;ociety; and, of cour&s;e, ought to be &s;hunned as a pe&s;tilence. You la|boured to lower me in the opinion of my friends, but your arti&s;ices have been &s;een through, and we have to|tally done with you.</Q> Spatter now &s;truck down with con&s;cious guilt, ap|plied to Saunter to make his peace with Lady Da&s;hit, and with Dangle, but could not &s;ucceed; he then tried Rattle, but all to no purpo&s;e. He applied fir&s;t to one and then to another, and finding them all again&s;t him, and reproaching him, he thought the be&s;t thing he could do, was to decamp, and accordingly
<PB N="212" REF="211">left the room. <Q>Next (&s;aid Rattle) to the &s;atisfaction I receive in the pro&s;perity of an <HI>hone&s;t</HI> man, I am be&s;t plea&s;ed in the confu&s;ion of a <HI>ra&s;cal.</HI></Q> <Q>Having now got rid (&s;aid Dangle) of one ra&s;cal, let's &s;ee what's to be done with the other. Flint bring forward your pri&s;oner.</Q> Flint cries, <Q>I will your honour,</Q> and marches him up. <Q>The ra&s;cal's very looks betray him, (&s;aid Dangle). What, villain, was your view in all this?</Q>&mdash;<Q>He want|ed, your honour, (an&s;wers Flint for him,) to marry Lady Da&s;hit under fal&s;e colours.</Q>&mdash;<Q>It is a pity, (re|turned Dangle) there is no law to pu|ni&s;h &s;uch a mi&s;creant as he de&s;erves.
<PB N="213" REF="212">The war is over, (&s;ays, Rattle) or we might &s;end him for a &s;oldier.</Q>&mdash;<Q>No, your honour, (replied Flint) that would be di&s;gracing the profe&s;&s;ion.</Q> <Q>You're, right, Flint, (returned Rattle) I did not think of that.</Q>&mdash;<Q>The be&s;t way, (&s;aid Saunter) is, I believe, to put him into Flint's charge, and let him &s;trip him, and turn him into the &s;treet.</Q>&mdash;<Q>No, not &s;trip him, (replies Dangle to Saunter) the cloathers are not mine, (and then to Tom,) let me ne|ver &s;ee your face again.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Take him away, Flint, (&s;aid Rattle).</Q>&mdash;<Q>I will your honour (replied Flint) and, when I quit him, &s;hall I give him a part|ing kick?</Q>&mdash;<Q>Do what you will
<PB N="214" REF="213">with him, (&s;aid Dangle) there's no|thing too bad for him.</Q> At this, Flint collared Tom, and dragged him, out, with <Q>Come along, honey&mdash;come along, Sir Thomas Flam; come along;</Q> and the parties retired to talk the matter a little further over.</P>
<P>The reader will pardon a refletion naturally occurring on this &s;ubject, that it is the folly and weakne&s;s of &s;ome women that lays them open to &s;uch ar|tifices, and if they are entrapped, it is in a &s;nare of their own contriving: and, with re&s;pect to Spatter, however u&s;eful, or entertaining a man may render him|&s;elf to his aequaintance, and have his
<PB N="215" REF="214">faluts thus overlooked for a time; there is no &s;en&s;ible man but &s;ees throught the deceptions of a knave, and will, in the end, &s;et his face again&s;t him.</P>
