<P>A LETTER TO A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, ON MAIL-COACHES.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM much obliged to you for your favour of the 5th in&s;tant. I pay &s;uch de|ference to your opinion, that I entirely lay a&s;ide all thoughts of troubling your honourable Hou&s;e with the affair of repealing the act of exemp|tion of Mail Coaches from the payment of tolls. I would avoid every adventure which does not promi&s;e &s;ucce&s;s, and &s;hould be much mortified to be unhor&s;ed and laid &s;prawling on the <HI>arena</HI> of St. <HI>Stephen's.</HI></P>
<P>Yet I &s;hall be extremely &s;orry that any mem|ber of your Hou&s;e &s;hould, through any quick|ne&s;s of mi&s;apprehen&s;ion, wilful or natural, ima|gine me to be &s;o wild as to think of an attempt that was not founded on rea&s;onable and hone&s;t principles.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3">I am &s;en&s;ible that the exemption of the Mails from the payment of tolls commenced very early: I think, fir&s;t by an act of <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> which was afterwards repeated in &s;everal others, till it was oppre&s;&s;ively confirmed by that of the 25th Geo. III.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;econd-&s;ighted of your Hou&s;e could never have fore&s;een that the u&s;age of the &s;ingle hor&s;e and po&s;t-boy, afterwards in many parts converted into the light mail-cart drawn by one hor&s;e, would be &s;uper&s;eded by a <HI>royal</HI> car|riage drawn by four hor&s;es, and filled by pa&s;|&s;engers, who before rode in the common &s;tages, and contributed to &s;upport the roads which they pa&s;&s;ed over. This unfortunate change proceeded from an extent of prerogative, repined at only, when perverted to the injury of the &s;ubject; as this mo&s;t inconte&s;tably mu&s;t be allowed to have done.</P>
<P>Under the &s;anction of the fir&s;t act, turnpike gates were erected, and immen&s;e &s;ums of money lent on the national faith. For a long time the &s;ecurity was e&s;teemed good; and in <HI>Wales,</HI> where
<PB N="3" REF="4">five per cent. was given, people at fir&s;t were happy to place their money on mortgages they imagined &s;o &s;afe. The transfer was then ea&s;y, and the public re&s;ted perfectly content. The commi&s;&s;ioners did their duty fully: they laid out the money to the be&s;t advantage; nor did they de&s;i&s;t till the lowering of the tolls, by the fatal change of the mode of conveyance, had taken place.</P>
<P>I will exemplify the hard&s;hips only in the country I live. Other places equally remote from the capital mu&s;t come in for their &s;hare of the grievance: but they will fall under the com|mon de&s;cription.</P>
<P>Before the in&s;titution of mail-coaches, two &s;tage-coaches ran through the county of <HI>Flint.</HI> And, were it not for an eva&s;ion, the change of hor&s;es between gate and gate in the <HI>Mo&s;tyn</HI> di&s;trict, one of the di&s;tricts principally aggrieved, each would have paid forty pounds a year. This unhappily was left unguarded in the act. By the help of that eva&s;ion both together only paid that &s;um: and even that &s;um, had we not been
<PB N="4" REF="5">deprived of it, would have enabled us to take up 800l. more; and given us the power of re|pairing every part of the road which was not unexceptionably good.</P>
<P>Many parts may have been allowed to have been indifferent; but they were adequate to the u&s;es of the country, not only for the u&s;e of the farmers and the carriers, but al&s;o for the luxury of carriages.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate they were found at the introduc|tion of mail-coaches. The&s;e &s;oon occa&s;ioned the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the common &s;tages, and deprived us at once of forty pounds of annual income. In the year 1789, a per&s;on was &s;ent from the General Po&s;t Office to &s;urvey the roads. From his report, and by the orders of the Po&s;t-Office, indictments were preferred at the great &s;e&s;&s;ions at <HI>Mold,</HI> again&s;t the whole extent of road in the narrow but long county of <HI>Flint.</HI> In &s;ome in|&s;tances, I fear the grand jury made a &s;train of their con&s;ciences in finding the bills; for &s;ome
<PB N="5" REF="6">of the indicted places were in mo&s;t admirable re|pair. But we were unwilling to ob&s;truct any thing that tended to promote the public good.</P>
<P>Fines to the amount of 1200l. were impo&s;ed on the &s;everal town&s;hips, many of which were very &s;mall, and the inhabitants compo&s;ed of &s;mall farmers, and labourers, poor and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed to the highe&s;t degree.</P>
<P>Two of the&s;e town&s;hips had a great extent of road, and only a few labourers, and a few mi&s;er|able teams, to perform their &s;tatute duty. One of the&s;e town&s;hips, terrified with the pro&s;pect of ruin, by the execution of the <HI>&s;ummum jus,</HI> per|formed twenty-two days duty upon the road. The other town&s;hip had only a &s;ingle farmer living in it, who performed a duty of twenty-eight days.</P>
<P>The va&s;t expences which the commi&s;&s;ioners had been at in the repairs of the roads, had almo&s;t exhau&s;ted the credit, in &s;ome totally; &s;o that at pre&s;ent 50l. cannot be obtained for 400l. worth of our parchment &s;ecurities.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7">At this period I was moved with compa&s;&s;ion at the complaint and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the poor. This induced me to write my Circular Letter to the &s;everal grand juries of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI> in order to induce them to unite in a common cau&s;e. I blu&s;h at my want of &s;ucce&s;s, re&s;ulting from either ignorance of, or indifference to, the fir&s;t principles of &s;ecurity of property. I was &s;imple enough to think that the ju&s;tice of the cau&s;e would have in&s;ured an approbation of my plan. In&s;tead of that, I am told, that in &s;ome places it was even treated with rudene&s;s and contempt. I ventured even to write to two gentlemen with whom I was not per&s;onally ac|quainted: they never paid the le&s;t attention to my letter: they forgot my character, and they forgot their own.</P>
<P>I took the liberty of getting my Circular Letter conveyed to a third gentleman high in office, with whom I was acquainted. It was returned with (writ|ten on a corner of it) "Mr. <HI>Pennant</HI> is in the wrong, and I will have no concern in the affair."
<PB N="7" REF="8">The gentleman may be politically right; but I am confident that Mr. <HI>Pennant</HI> is not morally wrong.</P>
<P>There has certainly been a &s;trong mi&s;appre|hen&s;ion of my meaning. I did not intend the abolition of mail-coaches: they have their ob|jections; whether we con&s;ider the barbarity with which the poor hor&s;es are treated, or the very frequent de&s;truction of the pa&s;&s;engers&mdash;our old <HI>Jehus</HI> may have &s;lain their thou&s;ands; our mo|dern, their tens of thou&s;ands. I only wi&s;hed that they might not prove oppre&s;&s;ive to many of our counties, by cau&s;es I have before mentioned. True it is, that, in my fir&s;t Circular Letter, I did mo&s;t ra&s;hly and unadvi&s;edly hint, that they might, without injury, be converted into the mail-cart. The gentlemen of <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> who, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, did admit that &s;omething &s;hould be done for us, very ju&s;tly fired on the idea of &s;ending their <HI>The&s;pis</HI> again into his cart. A worthy friend of mine of that county warmly but kindly expo&s;tulated with me on the &s;ubject: but I hope this my declaration of repentance will be admitted, and atone for my error.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="9">The grand juries of <HI>Che&s;hire, Berk&s;hire, Mon|mouth&s;hire,</HI> and tho&s;e of <HI>North Wales,</HI> united in the &s;upport of my de&s;ign. The re&s;t of the counties proved to me the truth of the remark of Swift, <Q>That he never knew any per&s;on who did not bear the misfortunes of another per|fectly like a Chri&s;tian!</Q></P>
<P>Far the majority of the roads in <HI>England</HI> have great revenues, ari&s;ing from the multitude of &s;tage-coaches that keep their ground in defiance of mails. Our &s;tages are obliged to de&s;i&s;t from travelling and give the former a mo&s;t unju&s;t, and oppre&s;&s;ive monopoly. The counties intere&s;ted in them feel not our unhappine&s;s, and want ge|nero&s;ity to contribute to the alleviation of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es we &s;uffer.</P>
<P>We &s;hould have made a claim on the ju&s;tice of the Hou&s;e, had we had the mo&s;t di&s;tant pro|&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. We are now in the ca&s;e of creditors defrauded by the &s;uperior cunning of an artful debtor. Had an individual re|ceived an adequate mortgage on his e&s;tate, and
<PB N="9" REF="10">had afterwards the dexterity to le&s;&s;en the income, what name would he have de&s;erved? The highe&s;t term of reproach; but &s;uch a one that could never be applied the mo&s;t remotely to any mem|ber of your honourable Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This affair has never yet been &s;eriou&s;ly con|&s;idered. Good men, I tru&s;t, will now awake as from a &s;leep; and &s;tand amazed and confu&s;ed at the &s;ad delu&s;ion they di&s;covered that they had laboured under. Favourite &s;y&s;tems run away with mankind, and totally annihilate all attention to the inconveniences they occa&s;ion. The act was obtained late in the &s;e&s;&s;ions, hurried through a very thin hou&s;e, and with the &s;lighte&s;t oppo&s;i|tion. The legi&s;lature obliges a certain time of notice to be given before the introduction of a common turnpike bill. Let me a&s;k, &s;hould not at le&s;t the interval of a &s;e&s;&s;ion have been given for the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of &s;o &s;trange and unequal a taxa|tion?</P>
<P>What, may I a&s;k, could make the individual liable to cen&s;ure; and the actions of the collec|tive body be pa&s;&s;ed over without blame? Either the numbers defend, or &s;ome daemon, like the
<PB N="10" REF="11">gho&s;tly father of <HI>Charles</HI> I. has whi&s;pered in your ears, Have a double con&s;cience! one that is to make you con&s;ult the plain dictates of hone&s;ty: the other telling you to &s;upport &s;ome fancied public good, at the expence of a certain number of per&s;ons, who, in times not very remote, had tru&s;ted their money to the &s;ecurity of the public faith.</P>
<P>Or may you not hold the &s;ame doctrine as the nuns in <HI>Tri&s;tram Shandy;</HI> that the divi&s;ibility of &s;in may enable you to fritter it away into almo&s;t nothing?&mdash;You certainly have the advan|tage. The nuns were but two, you are five hundred and fifty-two to bear the feather-weight of the wrong deci&s;ion, you had mo&s;t unwarily been induced to make.</P>
<P>Let me now a&s;k, are there no in&s;tances of re|peal of acts on far le&s;s important occa&s;ions? I well recollect two. The fir&s;t is the <HI>Jew Act,</HI> which had in fact no con&s;equences to be feared, religious or political. The other was the cyder tax, e&s;teemed like ours a partial grievance; and
<PB N="11" REF="12">yet its overthrow was ea&s;ily effected. I reflect on the&s;e two acts repealed without cau&s;e, and on our oppre&s;&s;ions continued in defiance of every principle of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Since your honourable Hou&s;e was determined to weaken our &s;ecurities, ought it not to have fir&s;t paid off every turnpike mortgage? and then you might have had full liberty of doing what you plea&s;ed with the income of the gates.</P>
<P>I beg leave to lay before you a ca&s;e in which your Hou&s;e once &s;hewed a mo&s;t &s;crupulous atten|tion to the rights of creditors. That was by the repeal of a clau&s;e in the <HI>King&s;land</HI> turnpike act. Part of it leads from <HI>Shoreditch</HI> to <HI>Ware,</HI> and this part was cro&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Newmarket</HI> Road, and tolls were taken by the commi&s;&s;ioners of the <HI>Ware</HI> Road, from all travellers to and from that &s;eminary of virtue, merely for cro&s;&s;ing the road. On the renewing of the <HI>King&s;land</HI> turnpike act, the <HI>Newmarket</HI> people in&s;i&s;ted that they &s;hould pa&s;s free of tolls. A clau&s;e was in&s;erted in the new act for that purpo&s;e, and the cro&s;s-gates
<PB N="12" REF="13">were pulled down. The creditors of the <HI>King&s;|land</HI> turnpike petitioned to the Hou&s;e of Com|mons for redre&s;s; they &s;ucceeded, and the cro&s;s|gates were again erected, and the tolls taken till the whole of the creditors were paid.</P>

<P>I imagine that there is not a member of the Hou&s;e who has not acted as a commi&s;&s;ioner of the turnpikes. Let me reque&s;t him to call to mind, whether he has not in that character, or in the character of a magi&s;trate, treated with a har&s;h &s;everity the delinquent who through poverty has defrauded the gate of nine-pence. What
<PB N="13" REF="14">plea of con&s;cience has the commi&s;&s;ioner urged for maintaining the intere&s;ts of the gates, and di&s;charging his tru&s;t like a man of honour? Is there not a <HI>Lethean</HI> atmo&s;phere in the chapel of St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> &s;o &s;uddenly to efface all memory of tran&s;actions in the common air of the world? I tru&s;t that there is: otherwi&s;e the individual who in one place and in one character had been &s;o &s;trenuous to &s;ave a poor nine-pence, &s;hould in another place and in another character vote as a perqui&s;ite to the Comptroller General of the Po&s;t-Office, an exemption of the mails from toll, a &s;um amounting to not le&s;s than 90,000l. a year, on which he has a mo&s;t con&s;iderable poundage, be&s;ides &s;ome very good pickings from other ar|ticles. This I am a&s;&s;ured of by a worthy member of your Hou&s;e. I think his &s;alary is but 1500l. per ann. What a mon&s;trous quan|tity of &s;ack is allowed to his halfpennyworth of bread!</P>
<P>So liberally &s;upplied as the Comptroller has
<PB N="14" REF="15">been with the means, cannot &s;omething be de|ducted to relieve our complaint? If the honour|able Hou&s;e does not choo&s;e this mode, a &s;mall, a very &s;mall tax on the pa&s;&s;engers, and on the im|men&s;e &s;ums got by the carriage of parcels, would compen&s;ate for the lo&s;s of exemption of tolls. The rich <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> di&s;tricts would be above taking ad|vantage of this diminution of revenue to the Comptroller General. It is only for the poor <HI>Welch</HI> di&s;tricts, and a few others like circum|&s;tanced, for which it is humbly a&s;ked.</P>
<P>I have a re&s;pect for the plan of the mail|coaches, and for the inventor; but I never could think of applying to him as the <HI>nizam al muluc,</HI> the regulator of the po&s;ting-empire. There ought not to be in our con&s;titution &s;uch a mon&s;ter as a comptroller uncontrollable by his legi&s;lature, or his &s;uperiors in office: legi&s;lature mu&s;t now &s;ee its imprudence in permitting a la|titude of &s;o dangerous a nature. I, an indivi|dual, never could bear the thought: I looked
<PB N="15" REF="16">for redre&s;s to the Po&s;t-ma&s;ter General, or to the three e&s;tates of the kingdom.</P>
<P>I fear too great a veneration has been paid to this new-created office, and mode of conveying the mail. I always wi&s;h to pay every individual and every office a due re&s;pect; but in this ca&s;e I mu&s;t pre&s;erve the independent and u&s;eful man, and endeavour to correct every abu&s;e that falls within my &s;phere as a provincial magi&s;trate. What I am going to &s;ay may be deemed foreign to a legi&s;lative friend; yet as it may prove u&s;e|ful to many who behold the&s;e new vehicles with a kind of veneration, I &s;hall mention an affair which happened in our county in the la&s;t au|tumn. Let me premi&s;e, that tho&s;e protectors of the mail, the guards, relying on the name of royalty, had in the cour&s;e of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> road through <HI>North Wales,</HI> committed great exce&s;&s;es. One, on a trifling quarrel, &s;hot dead a poor old gate-keeper: a coroner's jury was huddled up; and, in defiance of the tears of the widow, no judicial notice has been taken of the affair to
<PB N="16" REF="17">this very day. In <HI>Angle&s;ey,</HI> another of the&s;e guards di&s;charged his pi&s;tol wantonly in the face of a chai&s;e hor&s;e, drawing his ma&s;ter, the Rev. <HI>John Bulkely,</HI> who was flung out, and died either on the &s;pot or &s;oon after. I think that his wife, who was with him, &s;urvived but a very &s;hort time. The&s;e guards &s;hoot at dogs, hogs, &s;heep and poultry, as they pa&s;s the road, and even in towns, to the great terror and danger of the inhabitants. I determined to put a &s;top to the&s;e exce&s;&s;es, and &s;oon had an opportunity.</P>
<P>A neighbouring gate-keeper laid before me a complaint, that one of the guards had threat|ened to blow his brains out; and had actually &s;hot a dog that had offended him by his bark|ing. I i&s;&s;ued out my warrant, had the guard &s;eized, and brought before me. He was a man who, for his great beauty and elegant per&s;on, was called the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Wales.</HI> I did not he&s;itate to play the Judge <HI>Ga&s;coigne;</HI> but from the goodne&s;s of his appearace, and the propriety of his beha|vour, I did not go quite the length that famous magi&s;trate did. I took bail for his appearance
<PB N="17" REF="18">at our quarter &s;e&s;&s;ions. He appeared before us, when, by the permi&s;&s;ion of the chairman, I took the lead in &s;peaking. I repre&s;ented to the audi|ence, that the guards were intru&s;ted with arms merely for the protection of the mail and the pa&s;&s;engers, not for the terror of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects; that a mail-coach was no &s;anctuary; that the bailiff might drag the debtor out of it. The con&s;table, the felon, the exci&s;eman might rummage it for contraband goods, and that with as little ceremony as if it had been a hig|gler's cart. I farther added, had the driver been the offender, as the guard was, he &s;hould have been taken into cu&s;tody, and the po&s;t-ma&s;ter of the di&s;trict left to provide another to convey the mail to the next &s;tage. The behaviour of the delinquent was &s;o becoming his &s;ituation, that by the leave of the court I di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the offend|er with &s;uch a reprimand as became the high &s;tation of a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> ju&s;tice of the peace: an of|fice in dignity and con&s;titutional utility inferior to none in the land. Young men of the age, early initiate your&s;elves into that great character!</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="19">I beg pardon for detaining you &s;o long, but &s;o much I thought was due to my&s;elf and to the public. A few papers I have &s;ubjoined will fling &s;ome farther light on the &s;ubject, as well as on my proceedings from the beginning. I re|main, with much regard,</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM much indebted to you for your late fa|vour, with an official letter inclo&s;ed. I have no kind of doubt but that the Comptroller Ge|neral will, on cool re-con&s;ideration of his de&s;ign of altering the cour&s;e of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> mail, be in|duced to lay it totally a&s;ide. He will admit the importance of the county of <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> in its an|cient &s;taple of the chee&s;e, on which our fleets and armies &s;o greatly depend. The city it&s;elf (if I may judge by the frequent adverti&s;ements) is about to enter deeply on the fu&s;tian manufac|ture. We have the comfort of &s;eeing <HI>Manche&s;|ter</HI> burning it&s;elf to a&s;hes: &s;o that we &s;hall have all the manufacture to our&s;elves. The great re|mittances
<PB N="20" REF="21">of taxes from the county, and from great part of <HI>North Wales,</HI> and the remittances to and from <HI>Ireland,</HI> and tho&s;e occa&s;ioned by the great biennial linen fairs, mu&s;t be flung into the &s;cale.</P>
<P>The port of <HI>Park-Gate</HI> has of late years ri&s;en into much con&s;equence. It at pre&s;ent maintains four &s;tout pacquets, which uninterruptedly ply between that port and <HI>Dublin.</HI> The corre&s;pon|dencies of the numbers of pa&s;&s;engers embarking or di&s;embarking, and the great remittances through this channel, are of no &s;mall moment, and of great general concern.</P>
<P>The county of <HI>Flint</HI> (little as it is of it&s;elf), thanks to you and other companies, &s;ettling among us, is now ri&s;ing into an amazing &s;tate of opulence: few perhaps can rival it. Our ancient lead trade was always con&s;iderable; but by the introduction of the copper and cotton bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>Holywell,</HI> its environs, and their depen|dancies,
<PB N="21" REF="22">may boa&s;t of commercial property, pro|bably to the amount of a million &s;terling.</P>
<P>I have always con&s;idered Mr. <HI>Palmer</HI>'s plan as u&s;eful to his country, and an honour to him|&s;elf, except in one article. I can never &s;uppo&s;e that he will per&s;i&s;t in deviating from the utility of his &s;cheme, by diverting the mail from &s;uch a country as I have de&s;cribed. <HI>Shrew&s;bury</HI> has already its mail; after <HI>O&s;we&s;try</HI> is pa&s;t, the greate&s;t part of the road to <HI>Conwy</HI> is mountain|ous, poor, and half depopulated.</P>
<P>It gives me concern to find our intere&s;ts cla&s;h with tho&s;e of the county of <HI>Salop.</HI> I mu&s;t allow the excellency of the great &s;taples of its capital, brawn and rich cakes; but &s;till we have the balance in our favour; for on the mo&s;t exact and impartial calculation, I do not find that at pre&s;ent the annual con&s;umption (of both together) can po&s;&s;ibly exceed the &s;um of 152341l. 163. 9&frac34;d.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="23">The exceptionable article I allude to is the exemption of the mail-coaches from tolls. This falls heavy on the le&s;&s;er di&s;tricts: po&s;&s;ibly we might have endured even that, had we not been in&s;ulted with indictments, and compelled to re|pairs beyond the real wants of the country. That is now over; we only wi&s;h the re&s;toration of our lo&s;t tolls, to enable us to &s;upport the roads in the pre&s;ent &s;tate, and to take away all future grounds of complaint from every quarter. This will induce me to per&s;i&s;t in my de&s;ign of apply|ing to Parliament for redre&s;s of the grievance that affects the gates from <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> to <HI>Conwy,</HI> let the rich <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> di&s;tricts take what &s;hare they plea&s;e in their own concerns. There is one diffi|culty in <HI>Flint&s;hire</HI> in re&s;pect to the road it&s;elf&mdash; I mean <HI>Rhiallt Hill;</HI> the alteration is beyond the power of the poor pari&s;h it lies in, and beyond the power of the poor <HI>Mo&s;tyn</HI> di&s;trict to effect. Po&s;&s;ibly the improvement may co&s;t from 300l. to 400l. I wi&s;h a &s;mall &s;um might begot from Parliament, for that and the relief of a few other poor town&s;hips. I cannot bear to drive over
<PB N="23" REF="24">roads &s;moothed by the bread of the poor pea|&s;antry. If the mail will be permanent, I will cheerfully &s;ub&s;cribe fifty guineas towards that improvement <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;ub&s;cription is now begun: by advice of my friends I &s;ub&s;cribed only 25l. for fear of di&s;couraging others from joining in this &s;alutary de&s;ign. Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> meditates an embankment acro&s;s part of the <HI>Conwy,</HI> to &s;ecure pa&s;&s;engers from the terrors of the quick&s;ands at low water; and to le&s;&s;en the length of the ferry pa&s;&s;age at high.</NOTE>.

<HEAD>A Letter to the wor&s;hipful <HI>Peter Bro&s;ton,</HI> E&s;q. Mayor of <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Downing,</HI> <DATE><HI>January</HI> 23, 1792,</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> two letters were laid by Mr. <HI>Smalley</HI> before the commi&s;&s;ioners of the <HI>Flint, Holywell,</HI> and <HI>Mo&s;tyn</HI> di&s;tricts, &s;igned D. <HI>Smith,</HI> and G. <HI>Boulton;</HI> in which our atten|tion was reque&s;ted to the repair of the roads which lay in our county in the cour&s;e of the mail. It falls to my lot to de&s;ire you to com|municate to your re&s;pectable corporation, what the commi&s;&s;ioners have done, and what they in|tend to do of their own proper motions, not from the fear of any of the very unbecoming menaces &s;ent forth.</P>
<P>On the road from <HI>Holywell</HI> to the extremity of the di&s;trict (which is called the <HI>Flint</HI>), has been
<PB N="25" REF="26">laid out, within two years, 9531. in the &s;pace of five miles: great part of which, long before the indictments, was in mo&s;t admirable repair.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mo&s;tyn</HI> di&s;trict begins at the we&s;tern end of the <HI>Flint:</HI> much of it is in very good order: part is very indifferent, owing to the impo|veri&s;hed &s;tate of the <HI>Mo&s;tyn</HI> di&s;trict, and to the inability of the poor inhabitants of the town&s;hip in which <HI>Rhiallt-hill</HI> lies, to repair that part which is bad by nature. I propo&s;e a &s;ub&s;crip|tion: you &s;ee my offer in the inclo&s;ed. We look up to the city of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> as both are en|gaged in a common cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>Holywell</HI> di&s;trict is, excepting near <HI>Halkin,</HI> in excellent repair. The part complained of will be attended to at the next meeting at <HI>Holywell,</HI> at eleven o'clock on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the 8th of <HI>Fe|bruary.</HI> We &s;hall be happy to &s;ee any gentle|men on the part of your city.</P>
<P>Excu&s;e me if I remind the city of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> the county, and al&s;o the county of <HI>Flint,</HI> that our
<PB N="26" REF="27">importance is &s;uch, that our demand of a mail is a matter of right; not a petition for favour. How &s;uperior is the ju&s;tice of our claim to that of <HI>Salop,</HI> which had long &s;ince its independent mail!</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to my particular actings, I never will per&s;i&s;t in any thing that is wrong; nor de&s;i&s;t from any thing that is right. Our claim for aboli&s;hing the exemption from tolls is founded on common hone&s;ty. My &s;eizing on the guard was the act of an attentive magi&s;trate, to prevent future murders. Two, if not three, had been committed: one near <HI>Conwy;</HI> another in <HI>Angle&s;ey:</HI> be&s;ides the terror &s;pread along the whole road by the wanton conduct of the profligate guards. I brought the affair before our quarter-&s;e&s;&s;ion; more to &s;et it in the true light than to puni&s;h the offender. I was a&s;per&s;ed in your city; but the examination wiped away the dirty paragraph.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE><HI>Downing,</HI> <DATE><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 6, 1791.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I REQUEST you to lay before the public the following adverti&s;ement, addre&s;&s;ed by the com|mi&s;&s;ioners of the <HI>Mo&s;tyn</HI> turnpike di&s;trict, in order to avert in future the hard&s;hips &s;everal of the town&s;hips of the county of <HI>Flint</HI> labour un|der in the repairs of the roads. The adverti&s;e|ment it&s;elf relates to the greater part of the griev|ances. It was &s;ent to the paper too late to in|form the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> circuits, but has been approved by the grand juries of <HI>Che&s;hire, Denbigh&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Flint&s;hire,</HI> at the Spring a&s;&s;izes, and by that of <HI>Berk&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Monmouth&s;hire,</HI> being the fir&s;t of the Autumn a&s;&s;izes. Let me here inform you, that, by indictments from the General Po&s;t-Office, fines to the amount of 1200l. have been laid on the &s;everal town&s;hips lying in the cour&s;e of the po&s;t-roads in the little county of <HI>Flint,</HI> many of which are very
<PB N="28" REF="29">&s;mall, and labour under the greate&s;t poverty. One in particular has a va&s;t extent of road to repair, and only a few labourers, and four mi&s;er|able teams to perform their &s;tatute labour. Un|der tho&s;e circum&s;tances, terrified with the pro|&s;pect of ruin, they performed twenty-two days &s;tatute duty. The French <HI>corv&eacute;es,</HI> now &s;o rea|&s;onably aboli&s;hed, were introduced on Briti&s;h ground, yet in vain; for a fine of 82l.10s. was impo&s;ed on the poor people. So little intere&s;ted were they, and numbers of others of the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> town&s;hips, in the pa&s;&s;age of the mail-coach, that po&s;&s;ibly they do not receive a letter in a year; yet the&s;e town&s;hips mu&s;t &s;uffer equally with the mo&s;t opulent and commercial towns. Many of the roads were unexceptionably repaired; the re&s;t were in &s;ufficient repair for the u&s;es of the farmer, for the u&s;es of the gentlemen's carriages, and for the u&s;es of the mail, before the late un|guarded innovations. We are like the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> required to make brick without &s;traw. The means of repair are taken from us, and we are fined for not performing impo&s;&s;ibilities. A po&s;t-road is a
<PB N="29" REF="30">national concern; that to a neighbouring king|dom doubly &s;o: and certainly that con&s;ideration &s;hould induce legi&s;lature to afford an aid in &s;uch ca&s;es in which it is found nece&s;&s;ary; and if a road mu&s;t be fini&s;hed with finical perfection, the ex|pence ought never to fall on tho&s;e who are to|tally unintere&s;ted in it. Ju&s;tice can never require that the poor &s;hould keep pace with the innova|tions made for the benefit of commerce or luxury. Much of the road-laws calls loudly for a reform: in all laws there &s;hould be a point of limitation. The attention of the grand juries is reque&s;ted at the en&s;uing a&s;&s;izes. It is hoped that they will direct their repre&s;entatives to make the mail|coaches liable to tolls. We mean no injury to Mr. <HI>Palmer:</HI> let him, before the meeting of parliament, &s;ugge&s;t any remedy for the evil, and we &s;hall re&s;t content. They will certainly do away the great parliamentary opprobrium of the act pa&s;&s;ed by their predece&s;&s;ors; which le&s;&s;ens a &s;ecurity granted on the faith of parliament. And much more may be &s;aid on this &s;ubject; but the detail is re&s;erved for another occa&s;ion; you may
<PB N="30" REF="31">be again troubled with my complaints, as well as &s;ome account of a town&s;hip grievance, brought on it by tho&s;e who&s;e peculiar office it was to have guarded again&s;t the deceptions which impo&s;ed on their judgment, and brought on a mo&s;t erroneous and di&s;graceful adjudication.</P>

<HEAD>"GENERAL TURNPIKE CONCERN.</HEAD>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>1. AT a meeting of the tru&s;tees of the <HI>Mo&s;tyn</HI> turnpike, held at the hou&s;e of <HI>Jo&s;eph Roberts,</HI> at the <HI>Blue Bell,</HI> on <HI>Saturday, July</HI> 30, 1791, the &s;tate of the roads was taken into con|&s;ideration:</P>
<P>2. When it appeared, that parts of the coal-road were greatly out of repair; the trade in which was the original foundation of this turnpike.</P>
<P>3. That the pre&s;ent annual tolls are very inadequate to remedy the evil.</P>
<P>4. That the failure of the tolls does not ari&s;e from any decay of trade in the country, but from the exemption granted by parliament, by the 25th Geo. III. c. 57, to the mail-coaches from the payment of any tolls.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="33">5. That, by &s;uch exemption, the common &s;tage-coaches have been obliged to de&s;i&s;t from travelling, by rea&s;on of the burthen they are &s;ingly to &s;u&s;tain, and which the mail-coaches are freed from, and now in many places monopolize the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>6. That the <HI>Mo&s;tyn</HI> di&s;trict alone &s;uffers a lo&s;s of 40l. a year, which is the intere&s;t of 800l. the lo&s;s of which prevents the tru&s;tees from the repairing of road equal to the expenditure of &s;uch a &s;um.</P>
<P>7. That the clau&s;e of exemption in favour ot the mail-coaches is highly detrimental to the credit of the tolls, and the &s;ecurity of the lenders, who had lent their money under the pledge of parliamentary faith.</P>
<P>8. Ordered, That the expediency of peti|tioning parliament on this &s;ubject be farther taken into con&s;ideration, and that the&s;e re&s;o|lutions be publi&s;hed in the next <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> paper,
<PB N="33" REF="34">as they are public concerns; every po&s;t-road, and its &s;everal creditors, being intere&s;ted therein.</P>
<P>9. That the &s;um of ten guineas be paid into the hands of the &s;olicitor, towards the ex|pences of the propo&s;ed bill, for repealing the exemption of tolls of the mail-coaches, and for &s;ubjecting them to tolls, in ca&s;e &s;uch bill be brought into parliament: and that the commi&s;|&s;ioners of the &s;everal turnpike di&s;tricts in <HI>Great Britain</HI> be invited to corre&s;pond, by their trea|&s;urers, on the &s;ubject, with <HI>Samuel Small,</HI> trea&s;urer of the <HI>Flint</HI> and <HI>Holywell</HI> di&s;tricts, and <HI>John Lloyd,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;tant trea&s;urer of that of <HI>Mo&s;tyn.</HI></P>
<P>10. That the thanks of the commi&s;&s;ioners be given to the foremen and grand juries of the counties of <HI>Che&s;hire, Denbigh&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Flint&s;hire,</HI> for their liberal concurrence with the re&s;olutions of the commi&s;&s;ioners of the <HI>Mo&s;tyn</HI> di&s;trict.</P>
<P>11. That it is reque&s;ted of the gentlemen of this county to attend at <HI>Mold,</HI> on <HI>Saturday</HI> the 9th of <HI>April,</HI> to give a &s;anction to this propo&s;al,
<PB N="34" REF="35" MS="y">and to prepare one or more petitions, or to give nece&s;&s;ary in&s;truction to the repre&s;entatives of the county and borough, &amp;c. as may then be thought proper.</P>
<P>12. And in order to give force to this rea|&s;onable claim on parliament, it is recommended to the gentlemen of neighbouring counties, who may attend the duty of their country on the en&s;uing grand juries, to take the above into con&s;ideration, and add their weight to the common cau&s;e.
