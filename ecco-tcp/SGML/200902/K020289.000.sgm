<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following play was written above three years ago, and was &s;oon after &s;hewn to &s;ome of the principal performers of both hou&s;es. It took its ri&s;e from Mi&s;s EL|LIOT'S being advi&s;ed to revive <HI>The Country Wife</HI> for her benefit the fir&s;t &s;ea&s;on of her engagement at Covent-Garden theatre. That play, upon a review of it, appeared inad|mi&s;&s;ible on account of the ob&s;cenity which di&s;colours the whole. The author, or rather the compiler of the en|&s;uing &s;cenes, undertook to alter WYCHERLEY's play for Mi&s;s ELLIOT again&s;t the following winter; but hearing, in the mean time, that Mr. BICKERSTAFF had employed him&s;elf upon one of WYCHERLEY's pieces, he made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ee that gentleman, le&s;t this writer &s;hould inter|fere with a plan already pre-occupied. He found that the PLAIN DEALER had been Mr. BICKERSTAFF's object, and that there was no danger of cla&s;hing with the &s;cheme of any other author. Upon a clo&s;er examination, therefore, of <HI>The Country Wife,</HI> it was thought proper to de&s;ert it in|tirely, and to re&s;ort to MOLIERE, the original ma&s;ter whom WYCHERLEY copied. The celebrated comedy of <HI>L'Ecole de Femmes</HI> appeared too thin of bu&s;ine&s;s, con&s;i&s;ting mo&s;tly in narrative. To &s;upply that deficiency the de&s;ign occurred of making MOLIERE him&s;elf &s;upply the requi&s;ite materials; and for this purpo&s;e L'ETOURDIE and L'Ecole DE MARIS were called in as auxiliaries. Upon this idea the play was &s;oon fini&s;hed, and it con&s;i&s;ts of characters, &s;ituations, and bu&s;ine&s;s, from tho&s;e three plays, interwoven into one fable, with as much &s;kill as a little lei&s;ure in the &s;ummer time would permit. With the profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign of conden&s;ing what appeared to be the be&s;t of three performances into one play, it was deemed unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;uppre&s;s any one &s;cene of true nature, merely becau&s;e the author of <HI>High Life below Stairs,</HI> and &s;ome other Engli&s;h writers, might occa&s;ionally be <HI>tracked in the &s;now of Moliere.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="3">The play, when fini&s;hed, was given to Mi&s;s ELLIOT, and it &s;o happened, that &s;he had no opportunity of producing it till this &s;ea&s;on. When in September la&s;t, her bargain both for her&s;elf and the play was in agitation with Mr. BEARD, the author of the&s;e &s;heets was a&s;toni&s;hed to hear that <HI>The Country Girl</HI> was actually in rehear&s;al at Drury Lane, and that the parts had been given out in the &s;ummer, nay, <HI>as fa&s;t as they were written.</HI> This, it mu&s;t not be di&s;&s;embled, looked like a <HI>de&s;ign of fore&s;talling the market;</HI> e&s;pecially as it was under&s;tood, that Mi&s;s ELLIOT and the SCHOOL FOR GUARDIANS, had been offered the &s;pring before to the ma|nager of Drury Lane, <HI>upon his own terms.</HI> A remon&s;trance was immediately made to Mr. GARRICK, purporting that he, who had long been a manager of a &s;ucce&s;sful theatre, was going to enter into a competition with a young actre&s;s for the pro|fits of a play. A meeting en&s;ued, where a gentleman of the fir&s;t character for probity and genius, was &s;o obliging as to be the arbitrator. Mr. GARRICK there prote&s;ting, that he never heard of Mi&s;s ELLIOT's play till within a few days; it was thereupon determined, that it was, in that ca&s;e, an accidental cla&s;hing, but that a de&s;ign of <HI>fore&s;talling</HI> would have been illiberal and unhand&s;ome. This la&s;t point of ho|nour Mr. GARRICK &s;eemed to learn upon this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Both parties were, in con&s;equence, left to pur&s;ue their own intere&s;ts. And now the pre&s;ent writer will di&s;mi&s;s THE SCHOOL FOR GUARDIANS, after &s;aying, that he com|po&s;ed it with the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted principle; and that, if it prove in any degree conducive to the &s;ervice of a young actre&s;s, or the public entertainment, he has all the reward he ever propo&s;ed to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>N. B. <HI>An entire &s;cene in the &s;econd act, page 30. has been omitted &s;ince the fir&s;t repre&s;entation, and would have been di&s;carded from this edition, but that the greate&s;t part of the play was printed, before it was acted.</HI></P>

<SP>
<L>MAY I intrude upon your patience for a minute?</L>
<L>Ladies and gentlemen, before the opening of the play,</L>
<L>Ju&s;t to excu&s;e an accident, which, I hope has no mi&s;chief in it,</L>
<L>I fain, if you'll permit, a word or two would &s;ay.</L>
<L>I hope you'll not be angry; but we've got no prologue for to night;</L>
<L>And &s;o I thought it was be&s;t to come and tell ye all the truth downright.</L>
<L>I went to Mr. Poet, and I &s;poke to him all I could,</L>
<L>But he &s;aid he had not lei&s;ure, tho' I know it's in his power if he would.</L>
<L>"A prologue, ma'am," &s;ays he!&mdash;"Yes, Sir, a prologue if you plea&s;e."</L>
<L>And then I did &s;o entreat the man, and beg, and pray, and teaze.</L>
<L>I told him, "You know, Sir, what a mi&s;erable plight we all are in,</L>
<L>To frown upon the performers, when pit, box, and gallery begin;</L>
<L>Whu&mdash;go the catcalls&mdash;dub&mdash;dub&mdash;dub&mdash;each dreadful critick's &s;tick</L>

<L>All this and more I &s;aid, but he, determin'd &s;till,</L>
<L>In formal fu&s;tian thus declar'd his will.</L>
<L>"Oft have I tried"<STAGE>[&s;eems puzzled]</STAGE>&mdash;&s;omething about his &s;tile,</L>
<L>And how he felt the Town's indulgent &s;mile.</L>
<L>"Were I again to try my &s;canty vein,</L>
<L>I'd beg protection for the feeble &s;train.</L>
<L>But then to &s;ue&mdash;he paus'd and rubb'd his head&mdash;</L>
<L>To &s;ue&mdash;when fam'd MOLIERE the &s;tage doth tread,</L>
<L>Were to prophane the manes of the dead.</L>
<L>MOLIERE, of old, and &s;till with rapture &s;een,</L>
<L>Was legi&s;lator of the comic &s;cene.</L>
<L>To bid his SIMPLE GIRL a&s;&s;ert the &s;tage,</L>
<L>And if &s;he plea&s;es, &s;trive to mend the age,</L>
<L>This was my motive;&mdash;this my only aim;</L>
<L>Heedle&s;s of gain!&mdash;no candidate for fame!</L>
<L><PB REF="5">An audience will weigh all in equal &s;cales,</L>
<L>For ju&s;tice, and not party, there prevails."</L>
<L>Thus &s;poke Mr.Poet, and then with long &s;teps march'd away;</L>
<L>And now I am left alone to apologize for offering you this night's play.</L>
<L>We'll &s;trive to make you laugh, if our aim be not perverted;</L>
<L>Pray, how d'ye find your&s;elves?&mdash;Are ye in good humour, and willing to be diverted?</L>
<L>If you approve,</L>
<L>The <HI>Ro&s;tiad Scribbler</HI> then no more I'll dread,</L>
<L>Who points his malice at a woman's head!</L>
<L>Who drop by drop his venom doth di&s;til,</L>
<L>While MOTHER-DULLNESS guides the hireling's quill.</L>
<L>Lull'd in her lap, &s;trange wonders he de&s;cries,</L>
<L>And TERENCE &s;eems&mdash;a Frenchman to his eyes!</L>
<L>From thence he i&s;&s;ues &s;oul decrees on plays,</L>
<L>Adorns with &s;candal, and lampoons with prai&s;e.</L>
<L>One &s;mile from you defeats the &s;land'rer's aim;</L>
<L>His calumny, like your APPLAUSE, is fame.</L>
<L>From your applau&s;e our mimic glories ri&s;e;</L>
<L>In plea&s;ing you my whole ambition lies.</L>

<P>My dear Belford, nothing depre&s;&s;es my &s;pirits&mdash;though you thought they were too high la&s;t night, and were for letting me a little blood. Death!
<PB N="5" REF="14">
man, you make nothing of di&s;playing an ell of &s;word|blade in defence of your mi&s;tre&s;s's top-knot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you know I love too tenderly to bear the te&s;t of raillery&mdash;it is the infirmity of my temper; why would you put me to it?&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you that know my turn of mind, why would you be angry with me?&mdash;I am happily a follower of the laughing philo&s;opher&mdash;</P>

<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Po! prithee, man, don't be &s;uch a cox|comb.&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee, don't you be &s;o moro&s;e, &s;o &s;our, &s;o di&s;contented a &s;pirit&mdash;But if in your phra&s;e I am a coxcomb, with all my heart, i'faith: but take this along with you&mdash;what you mean as a term of reproach, I receive as a compliment to the materials nature has been plea&s;ed to compound in this happy frame of mine&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Po! Po! running on at the old rate&mdash;If &s;elf-applau&s;e be philo&s;ophy, you have a comfortable &s;hare.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have, Sir, and while my happine&s;s is pre&s;erved by it, keep you the gravity and good &s;en&s;e, that make you too refined to be plea&s;ed, too wi&s;e to be merry, and too knowing to be contented.&mdash;I am in a fair way to be &s;ucce&s;sful, without any trouble at all;&mdash;you are likely to be mo&s;t &s;curvily di&s;appointed after a world of pains&mdash;An humble bow, which my dancing-ma&s;ter taught me, while I laughed at him, a fa&s;hionable coat, for which, if my taylor is ever paid he will laugh at me,&mdash;an intriguing &s;nuff-box,&mdash; and an apt valet de chambre, all the&s;e make love for me, and&mdash;.</P>

<P>Oh! yes, when the trouble is over, I take the reward.&mdash;Did you ever know a general officer, who, when the hor&s;e and the foot, and the right and left wing have carried the day for him, did not claim to him&s;elf both the honour and the booty?
<PB N="6" REF="15">
But you make a toil of a plea&s;ure&mdash;love, which to me is a &s;cene of delight, to you is a drudgery; your temper grows as &s;our, as a prude's when the &s;ermon is long; and as hot as a Wel&s;hman's, if you laugh at his pedigree; or a profe&s;&s;ed &s;harper's, if you doubt his honour, after he has cogged the dice, and picked your pocket of your money.</P>

<P>Why I own I am piqued and naturally. If any friend of mine, out of mere &s;pleen, &s;peak de|tractingly of the per&s;on I admire: it were ba&s;e infi|delity in love not to defend her, when &s;he is di&s;pa|raged&mdash;my every thought is dedicated to her.&mdash;Ab&s;ent I &s;ee her, hear her, and my imagination gloats for ever on her charms.</P>
