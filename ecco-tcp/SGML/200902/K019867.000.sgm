<L>WHEN famed Columbus nobly dared to brave,</L>
<L>The untry'd perils of the We&s;tern wave;</L>
<L>Ten thou&s;and dangers in his pa&s;&s;age lay,</L>
<L>Dark was his night, and dreary was his day!</L>
<L>The rude companions of his bold de&s;ign,</L>
<L>Fatigued with toil, again&s;t their chief combine:</L>
<L>When &s;udden&mdash;bur&s;ting on th' a&s;toni&s;h'd view!</L>
<L>A world di&s;covered, proved his judgment true.&mdash;</L>
<L>"Yet black ingratitude, the Great Man's fate!</L>
<L>"Pur&s;ued Columbus with envenomed hate;</L>
<L>"But minds like his a ba&s;e degenerate race,</L>
<L>"Might meanly per&s;ecute&mdash;but not di&s;grace:</L>
<L>"The noble &s;oul its energy maintains,</L>
<L>"In &s;pite of dungeons, tyranny, and chains."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The &s;ons of Europe found a guilele&s;s race,</L>
<L>No fraud was veiled beneath the &s;miling face;</L>
<L>Their manners, mild, benevolent, and kind,</L>
<L>Pourtrayed the cloudle&s;s &s;un&s;hine of the mind:</L>
<L>Ble&s;s'd in their Prince's patriarchal reign,</L>
<L>Who&s;e power relieved, but ne'er inflicted pain,</L>
<L>Their placid lives no fancy'd evils knew;</L>
<L>Their joys were many, and their wants were few.</L>
<L>One cu&s;tom with their virtues ill agreed,</L>
<L>Which made Humanity with angui&s;h bleed;</L>
<L>Compelled at Super&s;tition's &s;hrine to bow,</L>
<L>The haple&s;s victims of a cruel vow!</L>
<L><PB REF="5">Their &s;weete&s;t maids were often doomed to prove,</L>
<L>No joy in friend&s;hip, nor no bli&s;s in love!</L>
<L>Yet love and nature cannot be &s;uppre&s;t,</L>
<L>The &s;igh will heave, and palpitate the brea&s;t;</L>
<L>For &s;pite of vows, which Heaven's wi&s;e laws di&s;own,</L>
<L>Love &s;its triumphant on the heart&mdash;his throne!</L>

<L>To aggravate the &s;en&s;e of human woes!</L>

<L>Stands without rival on the rolls of Fame;</L>
<L><HI>Him</HI> whom the pa&s;&s;ions own with one accord,</L>
<L>Their Great Dictator, and de&s;potic Lord!</L>
<L>Who placed aloft on In&s;piration's throne,</L>
<L>Made Fancy's magic kingdom all his own,</L>
<L>Bur&s;t from the trammels which his mu&s;e confined,</L>
<L>And poured the wealth of his exhau&s;tle&s;s mind!</L>

<L>OLD &s;tories done&mdash;old times long &s;ince forgotten,</L>
<L>Like mu&s;ty records, little read, and rotten,</L>
<L>Return we now, to periods &s;ounder grown,</L>
<L>To happier days, and readings of our own;</L>
<L>Where'er we ope the book, the &s;tile is clear,</L>
<L>The int're&s;t charming, the conclu&s;ions, dear;</L>
<L>Our means are flouri&s;hing, our joys not &s;cant,</L>
<L>Po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of every good, the heart can want,</L>
<L>Old tales of conque&s;ts, thrown on di&s;tant &s;helves,</L>

<L>Already having routed <HI>&s;age</HI> Papa;</L>
<L>"I'm not a chit&mdash;I <HI>will</HI> turn up my locks, &mdash;</L>
<L>"I <HI>will</HI> wear powder, and I <HI>won't</HI> wear frocks;&mdash;</L>

<L>To brave the i&s;&s;ue of your high award;</L>
