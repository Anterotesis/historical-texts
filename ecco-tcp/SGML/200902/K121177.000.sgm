<HEAD>To the Right Honourable <HI>CHARLES MONTAG&V;E,</HI> One of the Lords of the <HI>TREASURY.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Heartily wi&s;h this Play <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> as perfect as I intended it, that it might be more worthy your Acceptance; and that my Dedication of it to you, might be more becoming that Ho|nour and E&s;teem which I, with every Body, who are &s;o fortunate as to know you, have for you. It had your Countenance when yet unknown; and now it is made publick, it wants your Pro|tection.</P>
<P>I would not have any Body imagine, that I think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> with|out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Faults, for I am Con&s;cious of &s;everal. I confe&s;s I de&s;ign'd (whatever Vanity or Ambition occa&s;ion'd that De&s;ign) to have written a true and regular Comedy, but I found it an Undertaking which put me in mind of&mdash;<HI>Sudet multum, fru&s;traque laboret au|&s;us idem.</HI> And now to make Amends for the Vanity of &s;uch a De|&s;ign, I do confe&s;s both the Attempt, and the imperfect Perfor|mance. Yet I mu&s;t take the Boldne&s;s to &s;ay, I have not mi&s;car|ried in the whole; for the Mechanical part of it is perfect. That I may &s;ay with as little Vanity, as a Builder may &s;ay he has built a Hou&s;e according to the Model laid down before him; or a Gar|diner that he has &s;et his Flowers in a Knot of &s;uch or &s;uch a Fi|gure. I de&s;ign'd the Moral fir&s;t, and to that Moral I invented the Fable, and do not know that I have borrow'd one Hint of it any where. I made the Plot as &s;trong as I could, becau&s;e it was &s;ingle, and I made it &s;ingle, becau&s;e I would avoid Confu&s;ion, and was re&s;olved to pre&s;erve the three Unities of the Drama, which I have vi&s;ibly done to the utmo&s;t Severity. This is what I ought not to ob&s;erve upon my &s;elf; but the Ignorance and Malice of the greater Part of the Audience is &s;uch, that they would make a Man turn Herald to his own Play, and Blazon every Character. However, Sir, this Di&s;cour&s;e is very impertinent to you, who&s;e
<PB REF="3">
Judgement much better can di&s;cern the Faults, than I can ex|cu&s;e them; and who&s;e good Nature, like that of a Lover, will find out tho&s;e hidden Beauties (if there are any &s;uch) which it wou'd be great Immode&s;ty for me to di&s;cover. I think I don't &s;peak im|properly when I call you a <HI>Lover</HI> of Poetry; for it is very well known &s;he has been a very kind Mi&s;tre&s;s to you; &s;he has not de|ny'd you the la&s;t Favour; you have enjoy'd her, and &s;he has been fruitful in a mo&s;t Beautiful I&s;&s;ue&mdash;If I break off abruptly here, I hope every Body will under&s;tand that it is to avoid a Commenda|tion, which, as it is your Due, would be mo&s;t ea&s;ie for me to pay, and too trouble&s;ome for you to receive.</P>
<P>I have, &s;ince the Acting of this Play, harken'd after the Objecti|ons which have been made to it; for I was Con&s;cious where a true Critick might have put me upon my Defence. I was prepa|red for their Attack; and am pretty confident I could have vindi|cated &s;ome Parts, and excu&s;ed others; and where there were any plain Mi&s;carriages, I would mo&s;t ingenuou&s;ly have confe&s;s'd 'em. But I have not heard any thing &s;aid &s;ufficient to provoke an An|&s;wer. That which looks mo&s;t like an Objection, does not relate in particular to this Play, but to all or mo&s;t that ever have been written; and that is Soliloquy. Therefore I will an&s;wer it, not only for my own &s;ake, but to &s;ave others the Trouble, to whom it may hereafter be Objected.</P>
<P>I grant, that for a Man to Talk to him&s;elf, appears ab&s;urd and unnatural; and indeed it is &s;o in mo&s;t Ca&s;es; but the Circum&s;tan|ces which may attend the Occa&s;ion, make great Alteration. It of|tentimes happens to a Man, to have De&s;igns which require him to him&s;elf, and in their Nature cannot admit of a Confident. Such, for certain, is all Villany; and other le&s;s mi&s;chievous Intentions may be very improper to be Communicated to a &s;econd Per&s;on. In &s;uch a Ca&s;e therefore the Audience mu&s;t ob&s;erve, whether the Per&s;on upon the Stage takes any notice of them at all, or no. For if he &s;uppo&s;es any one to be by, when he talks to him&s;elf, it is mon&s;trous and ridiculous to the la&s;t degree. Nay, not only in this ca&s;e, but in any Part of a Play, if there is expre&s;&s;ed any know|ledge of an Audience, it is in&s;ufferable. But otherwi&s;e, when a Man in Soliloquy rea&s;ons with him&s;elf, and <HI>Pro</HI>'s and <HI>Con</HI>'s, and weighs all his De&s;igns: We ought not to imagine that this Man either talks to us, or to him&s;elf; he is only thinking, and thinking &s;uch Matter as were inexcu&s;able Folly in him to &s;peak. But be|cau&s;e we are conceal'd Spectators of the Plot in agitation, and the Poet finds it nece&s;&s;ary to let us know the whole My&s;tery of his
<PB REF="4">
Contrivance, he is willing to inform us of this Per&s;on's Thoughts; and to that end is forc'd to make u&s;e of the expedient of Speech, no other better way being yet invented for the Communication of Thought.</P>
<P>Another very wrong Objection has been made by &s;ome who have not taken Lei&s;ure to di&s;tingui&s;h the Characters. The Hero of the Play, as they are pleas'd to call him, (meaning <HI>Mellefont</HI>) is a Gull, and made a Fool, and cheated. Is every Man a Gull and a Fool that is deceiv'd? At that rate I'm afraid the two Cla&s;&s;es of Men, will be reduc'd to one, and the Knaves them&s;elves be at a lo&s;s to ju&s;tifie their Title: But if an Open-hearted hone&s;t Man, who has an entire Confidence in one whom he takes to be his Friend, and whom he has oblig'd to be &s;o; and who (to confirm him in his Opinion) in all Appearance, and upon &s;everal Trials has been &s;o: If this Man be deceiv'd by the Treachery of the other; mu&s;t he of nece&s;&s;ity commence Fool immediately, only becau&s;e the other has prov'd a Villam? Ay, but there was Caution given to <HI>Mellefont</HI> in the Fir&s;t Act by his Friend <HI>Carele&s;s.</HI> Of what Nature was that Caution? Only to give the Audience &s;ome Light into the Character of <HI>Maskwell,</HI> before his Appearance; and not to convince <HI>Mellefont</HI> of his Treachery; for that was more than <HI>Carele&s;s</HI> was then able to do: He never knew <HI>Maskwell</HI> guilty of any Villany; he was only a &s;ort of Man which he did not like. As for his &s;u|&s;pecting his Familiarity with my Lady <HI>Touchwood:</HI> Let 'em exa|mine the An&s;wer that <HI>Mellefont</HI> makes him, and compare it with the Conduct of <HI>Maskwell</HI>'s Character through the Play.</P>
<P>I would beg'em again to look into the Character of <HI>Maskwell</HI> be|fore they accu&s;e <HI>Mellefont</HI> of Weakne&s;s for being deceiv'd by him. For upon &s;umming up the Enquiry into this Objection, it may be found they have mi&s;taken Cunning in one Character, for Folly in another.</P>
<P>But there is one thing, at which I am more concerned than all the fal&s;e Critici&s;ms that are made upon me; and that is, &s;ome of the Ladies are offended. I am heartily &s;orry for it, for I declare I would ra|ther di&s;oblige all the Criticks in the World than one of the Fair Sex. They are concerned that I have repre&s;ented &s;ome Women Vicious and Affected: How can I help it? It is the Bu&s;ine&s;s of a Comick Poet to paint the Vices and Follies of Human-kind; and there are but two Sexes, Male, and Female, <HI>Men,</HI> and <HI>Women,</HI> which have a Title to Humanity: And if I leave one half of them out, the Work will be imperfect. I &s;hould be very glad of an opportunity to make my Compliment to tho&s;e Ladies who are of|fended: But they can no more expect it in a Comedy, than to be
<PB REF="5">
Tickled by a Surgeon, when he's letting 'em Blood. They who are Virtuous or Di&s;creet, can hardly be offended, for &s;uch Cha|racters as the&s;e di&s;tingui&s;h <HI>them,</HI> and make their Beauties more &s;hining and ob&s;erv'd: And they who are of the other kind, may neverthele&s;s pa&s;s for &s;uch, by &s;eeming not to be di&s;pleas'd, or touch'd with the Satire of this <HI>Comedy.</HI> Thus have they al&s;o wrongfully accus'd me of doing them a Prejudice, when I have in reality done them a Service.</P>
<P>I have heard there are &s;ome who intend to accu&s;e this Play of Smuttine&s;s and Bawdy: But I can hardly believe it, becau&s;e I took a particular Care to avoid it, and if they find any in it, it is of their own making, for I did not de&s;ign it to be &s;o under&s;tood. But to avoid my &s;aying any Thing upon a Subject, which has been &s;o admirably handled before, and for their better In&s;truction, I earne&s;tly recommend to their Peru&s;al, the Epi&s;tle Dedicatory before the <HI>Plain-Dealer.</HI></P>
<P>You will pardon me, Sir, for the Freedom I take of making An&s;wers to other People, in an Epi&s;tle which ought wholly to be &s;acred to you: But &s;ince I intend the Play to be &s;o too, I hope I may take the more Liberty of Ju&s;tifying it, where it is in the Right.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now, Sir, declare to the World, how kind you have been to my Endeavours; for in regard of what was well meant, you have excus'd what was ill perform'd. I beg you would con|tinue the &s;ame Method in your Acceptance of this Dedication. I know no other way of making a Return to that Humanity you &s;hew'd, in protecting an Infant, but by Enrolling it in your Service, now that it is of Age and come into the World. Therefore be pleas'd to accept of this as an Acknowledgement of the Favour you have &s;hewn me, and an Earne&s;t of the real Service and Gratitude of,</P>

<HEAD>To my Dear Friend Mr, <HI>CONGREVE,</HI> On His COMEDY, call'd, The Double-Dealer.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WELL then; the promis'd Hour is come at la&s;t;</L>
<L>The pre&s;ent Age of Wit ob&s;cures the pa&s;t:</L>
<L>Strong were our Syres; and as they Fought they Writ,</L>
<L>Conqu'ring with Force of Arms, and Dint of Wit;</L>
<L>Theirs was the Giant Race, before the Flood;</L>
<L>And thus, when <HI>Charles</HI> Return'd, our Empire &s;tood.</L>
<L>Like <HI>Janus</HI> he the &s;tubborn Soil manur'd,</L>
<L>With Rules of Husbandry the Rankne&s;s cur'd:</L>
<L>Tam'd us to Manners, when the Stage was rude;</L>
<L>And boi&s;trous <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Wit, with Art indu'd.</L>
<L>Our Age was cultivated thus at length;</L>
<L>But what we gain'd in Skill, we lo&s;t in Strength.</L>
<L>Our Builders were, with Want of Genius, cur&s;t;</L>
<L>The Second Temple was not like the Fir&s;t:</L>
<L>'Till You, the be&s;t <HI>Vitruvius,</HI> come at length;</L>
<L>Our Beauties equal; but excel our Strength.</L>
<L>Firm <HI>Dorique</HI> Pillars found Your &s;olid Ba&s;e:</L>
<L>The fair <HI>Corinthian</HI> crowns the higher Space;</L>
<L>Thus all below is Strength, and all above is Grace.</L>
<L>In ea&s;ie Dialogue is <HI>Fletcher</HI>'s Prai&s;e:</L>
<L>He mov'd the Mind, but had no Pow'r to rai&s;e.</L>
<L>Great <HI>John&s;on</HI> did by Strength of Judgment plea&s;e:</L>
<L>Yet doubling <HI>Fletcher</HI>'s Force, he wants his Ea&s;e.</L>
<L>In diff'ring Tallents both adorn'd their Age;</L>
<L>One for the Study, t' other for the Stage.</L>
<L>But both to <HI>Congreve</HI> ju&s;tly &s;hall &s;ubmit,</L>
<L>One match'd in Judgment, both o'er-match'd in Wit.</L>
<L>In Him all Beauties of this Age we &s;ee;</L>
<L><HI>Etherege</HI> his Court&s;hip, <HI>Southern</HI>'s Purity;</L>
<L>The Satire, Wit, and Strength of Manly <HI>Witcherly.</HI></L>
<L>All this in blooming Youth you have Atchiev'd;</L>
<L>Now are vour &s;oil'd Contemporaries griev'd;</L>
<L>So much the Sweetne&s;s of your Manners move,</L>
<L>We cannot Envy you, becau&s;e we Love.</L>

<L>And Scholar to the Youth he taught, became.</L>
</LG>

<L>Oh that your Brows my Lawrel had &s;u&s;tain'd,</L>
<L>Well had I been Depos'd if You had Reign'd!</L>
<L>The Father had de&s;cended for the Son;</L>

<L>Thus when the State one <HI>Edward</HI> did depo&s;e;</L>
<L>A Greater <HI>Edward</HI> in his Room aro&s;e.</L>
<L>But now, not I, but Poetry is curs'd;</L>
<L>For <HI>Tom</HI> the Second reigns like <HI>Tom</HI> the Fir&s;t.</L>
<L>But let'em not mi&s;take my Patron's Part;</L>
<L>Nor call his Charity their own De&s;ert.</L>
<L>Yet this I Prophe&s;ie; Thou &s;halt be &s;een,</L>
<L>(Tho' with &s;ome &s;hort Parenthe&s;is between:)</L>
<L>High on the Throne of Wit; and &s;eated there,</L>
<L>Not mine (that's little) but thy Lawrel wear.</L>
<L>Thy fir&s;t Attempt an early Promi&s;e made;</L>
<L>That early Promi&s;e this has more than paid.</L>
<L>So bold, yet &s;o judiciou&s;ly you dare,</L>
<L>That your lea&s;t Prai&s;e, is to be Regular.</L>
<L>Time, Place, and Action, may with Pains be wrought,</L>
<L>But Genius mu&s;t be born; and never can be taught.</L>
<L>This is Your Portion; this Your Native Store;</L>
<L>Heav'n, that but once was Prodigal before,</L>
<L>To <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> gave as much; &s;he cou'd not give him more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Maintain your Po&s;t: That's all the Fame you need;</L>
<L>For 'tis impo&s;&s;ible you &s;hou'd proceed.</L>
<L>Already I am worn with Cares and Age;</L>
<L>And ju&s;t abandoning th' Ungrateful Stage:</L>
<L>Unprofitably kept at Heav'ns Expence,</L>
<L>I live a Rent-charge on his Providence:</L>
<L>But You, whom ev'ry Mu&s;e and Grace adorn,</L>
<L>Whom I fore&s;ee to better Fortune born,</L>
<L>Be kind to my Remains; and oh defend,</L>
<L>Again&s;t your Judgment, your departed Friend!</L>
<L>Let not th' in&s;ulting Foe my Fame pur&s;ue;</L>
<L>But &s;hade tho&s;e Lawrels which de&s;cend to You:</L>
<L>And take for Tribute what the&s;e Lines expre&s;s:</L>

<L>MOors have this Way (as Story tells) to know</L>

<L>For Life will &s;truggle long, 'ere it &s;ink down:</L>

<P>'Tis a Mi&s;take, for Women may mo&s;t properly be &s;aid to be unmask'd when they wear Vizors; for that &s;ecures them from Blu&s;hing, and being out of Countenance, and next to being in the Dark, or alone, they are mo&s;t truly them&s;elves in a Vizor Mask.

<HEAD>EPILOGUE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mrs. <HI>Mountford.</HI></BYLINE>
<L>COuld Poets but fore&s;ee how Plays would take,</L>
<L>Then they could tell what Epilogues to make;</L>
<L>Whether to thank or blame their Audience mo&s;t:</L>
<L>But that late Knowledge does much Hazard co&s;t,</L>
<L>'Till Dice are thrown, there's nothing won, nor lo&s;t.</L>
<L>So 'till the Thief has &s;toll'n, he cannot know</L>
<L>Whether he &s;hall e&s;cape the Law, or no.</L>
<L>But Poets run much greater Hazards far,</L>
<L>Than they who &s;tand their Trials at the Barr;</L>
<L>The Law provides a Curb for its own Fury,</L>
<L>And &s;uffers Judges to direct the Jury.</L>
<L>But in this Court, what Diff'rence does appear!</L>
<L>For every one's both Judge and Jury here;</L>
<L>Nay, and what's wor&s;e, an Executioner.</L>
<L>All have a Right and Title to &s;ome Part,</L>
<L>Each chu&s;ing that in which he has mo&s;t Art.</L>
<L>The dreadful Men of Learning all Confound,</L>
<L>Unle&s;s the Fable's good, and Moral &s;ound.</L>
<L>The Vizor-Masks, that are in Pit and Gallery,</L>
<L>Approve, or Damn, the Repartee and Rallery.</L>
<L>The Lady Criticks, who are better read,</L>
<L>Enquire if Characters are nicely bred;</L>
<L>If the &s;oft things are penn'd and &s;poke with Grace:</L>
<L>They Judge of Action too, and Time, and Place;</L>
<L>In which we do not doubt but they're di&s;cerning,</L>
<L>For that's a kind of <HI>A&s;&s;ignation Learning.</HI></L>
<L>Beaus judge of Dre&s;s; the Witlings judge of Songs;</L>
<L>The Cuckoldom, of Ancient Right, to Cits belongs.</L>
<L>Thus poor Poets, the Favour are deny'd,</L>
<L>Even to make Exceptions, when they're Try'd.</L>
<L>'Tis hard that they mu&s;t ev'ry one admit;</L>
<L>Methinks I &s;ee &s;ome Faces in the Pit,</L>
<L>Which mu&s;t of Con&s;equence be Foes to Wit.</L>
<L>You who can Judge, to Sentence may proceed;</L>
<L>But tho' he cannot Write, let him be freed</L>
<L>At lea&s;t from their Contempt, who cannot Read.</L>
