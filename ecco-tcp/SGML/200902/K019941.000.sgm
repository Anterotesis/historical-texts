<P>AS in Parts of the following Poem there is an Allu&s;ion to a late <HI>delicate</HI> Production, it may not be improper to let the Reader into &s;ome Secrets concerning its Origin, that He may know the Progre&s;s of Wit, and how dangerous it is for young Adven|turers to attack <HI>Veterans</HI> in the Service, and teach them to pay a due Deference to all <HI>di&s;tingui&s;h'd Writers.</HI> An Author po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e happy Qua|lities which appear &s;o <HI>notoriou&s;ly</HI> in that Publication, <HI>viz.</HI> MODESTY, DECENCY, and GOOD NATURE, has an indi&s;putable Right to be believed upon his <HI>own</HI> A&s;|&s;ertion; and therefore it would be illiberal to doubt, but that he is, as he ought to be, DISTINGUISHED. This Ode then was <HI>perform'd</HI> by the <HI>Maker,</HI> as a Coffin to hold the dead Bodies of tho&s;e unfortunate Heroes &s;lain by his redoubtable Pen. A Gentleman it &s;eems
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
unhappily differ'd in Opinion with our Champion, and expre&s;s'd his Sentiments in a Paper call'd the <HI>Craft&s;man.</HI> Out-&s;allies the vindictive Knight (I &s;hould &s;ay Squire) to u&s;e his own Language, <HI>does him,</HI> &s;laps him into the Coffin, where he laid quietly for &s;ome Months, till a &s;econd <HI>Paroxy&s;m</HI> of Indignation, produced a &s;econd Murder, and the former Body was obliged to give Place to the latter. The Coffin is nailed down, the Plate alter'd, and the brazen In&s;cription informs us C. CHURCHILL died the 12^t^h of <HI>June</HI> 1761.</P>
<P>HAPPY is the Man that is always prepared for his Enemy, and has "his NAIADS by him <HI>ready made."</HI> It mu&s;t be allowed that this Gentleman has made huge Strides towards Parna&s;&s;us, and hath &s;trangely walk'd over all our Heads. I wi&s;h him Joy of hav|ing exalted him&s;elf to the Pinnacle of this aery Moun|tain, but beg Leave to remind him, that People &s;ome|times
