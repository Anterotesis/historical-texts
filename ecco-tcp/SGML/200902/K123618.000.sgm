<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN writing a Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Union,</HI> it could not be rea&s;onably ex|pected, that I &s;hould go any farther than the Fini&s;hing, Ratify|ing and Exchanging the Treaty in the Re&s;pective Parliaments of the two Nations to be United&mdash;and this I think I have Fini&s;hed in the following Sheets.</P>
<P>However, &s;ince the Work has lyen longer in the Pre&s;s than I at fir&s;t Expected; and &s;ome Remarkable things have in Con&s;equence of, and very much Depending upon the <HI>UNION</HI> happened &s;ince, I could not Satisfy my &s;elf, without giving a &s;hort Abridgement of the State of Things, between the Time of Fini&s;hing the Treaty, and the Publica|tion of this Work, which tho it be rather a Kind of Summary Reca|pitulation of things, than a Historical Narration, may yet be Equally Profitable to him that &s;hall Enquire into the Affairs of the United Kingdoms at that Time.</P>
<P>The Union took Place, as has been Noted the 1&s;t of <HI>May</HI> 1707, The Management of the Revenue, the Trials in the <HI>Exchequer</HI> and <HI>Admirality,</HI> were all Settled on a New Foot, Commi&s;&s;ioners of the <HI>Cu&s;toms, Exci&s;e</HI> and <HI>Equivalent,</HI> were appointed; Judges of the Court of <HI>Exchequer;</HI> a New <HI>Admirality,</HI> and their re&s;pective Offices were all fix'd; the Coin was Reformed, and entirely Reduc'd to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Standard <HI>(the &s;mall Copper Money only Excepted)</HI> Weights and Mea&s;ures were Regulated in part, and the re&s;pective Alterations and Models, whether in Government, or Commerce, Enacted by the <HI>Union,</HI> began every where to be put in Practice.</P>
<P>The <HI>Briti&s;h Parliament</HI> had been A&s;&s;embled at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> ac|cording to the Treaty, and had been Concluded with a General Sati&s;|faction; And Her Maje&s;ty began to &s;ee the Compleat End of Her Wi&s;hes, in the <HI>Union</HI> being actually Con&s;ummated; The <HI>Northern Peers</HI> and <HI>Commons Sitting,</HI> and that too with a General Satisfaction and Applau&s;e in that <HI>Fir&s;t Parliament</HI> of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>In this <HI>Parliament,</HI> &s;everal Things were done for the <HI>better Improv|ing,</HI> and as it was Called then, <HI>Rendring more Effectual,</HI> the <HI>UNION,</HI> particularly that of Di&s;&s;olving the <HI>Privy Council,</HI> Re-establi&s;hing the 
<PB N="ii" REF="3">
<HI>Se&s;&s;ions</HI> of the <HI>Peace</HI> by <HI>Ju&s;tices,</HI> &amp;c. Settling the <HI>Militia,</HI> and mak|ing <HI>Lord Lieutenants, Deputy Lieutenants,</HI> &amp;c. in every County <HI>as in England;</HI> of all which particular Mention is made in the fol|lowing Sheets&mdash;, &s;everal Regulations al&s;o in <HI>Trade</HI> were made here, for the Ea&s;e of <HI>North Britain;</HI> particularly the Removing the Difficul|ties of bringing Foreign Imported <HI>Goods</HI> from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> and the great Debate about the <HI>Wine, Brandy,</HI> &amp;c. brought into <HI>Scot|land,</HI> in the Interval between the Fini&s;hing, and Effectual taking Place of the <HI>Union,</HI> was put to an End, entirely in the Favour of <HI>Scotland,</HI> every thing being Cleared at once, and all Interruptions of <HI>Commerce</HI> thereby Removed.</P>
<P>But in the Middle of all this <HI>Harmony,</HI> an Accident interveen'd, which if it had not been Mercifully prevented by the immediate Inter|po&s;ition of a <HI>Divine Power,</HI> had at once Unravelled all this happily fini&s;hed <HI>Con&s;titution,</HI> and that in a manner that the mo&s;t Violent <HI>Op|po&s;er</HI> of the <HI>Union,</HI> could not in his warme&s;t Thoughts have hone&s;tly wi&s;hed to have &s;een.</P>
<P>This was the <HI>French Inva&s;ion;</HI> which Endangered not the <HI>Union</HI> only, but bid fair for Overturning the whole Frame of the pre&s;ent <HI>E&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> in <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State,</HI> tearing up the very Foundation of our <HI>Con&s;titution,</HI> I mean the <HI>Revolution;</HI> and Restoring, not only <HI>Tyranny</HI> and <HI>Arbitrary Government,</HI> but even <HI>Popery</HI> it &s;elf, that had &s;o many Years &s;ince, and at &s;uch Expence of Blood and Trea&s;ure been Dethroned in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall need to bring very few Arguments to prove this, to have been the immediate Con&s;equence of the Succe&s;s of this Expedition, after I have given a Summary Account of the Matter of Fact, which is briefly as follows.</P>
<P>About <HI>January</HI> 1707, frequent Advices from <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> gave the <HI>Government</HI> Notice, That the <HI>French</HI> were making great Preparations at <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> for &s;ome &s;ecret Expedition; upon far|ther Search into the Matter of Fact, it appeared that &s;everal Men of War were fitting out there with the utmost Expedition, and unu&s;ual Quantities of Arms and Ammunition providing, with a large Train of Artillery; which were all to be Shipped forthwith on Board the Ships fitting up as above.</P>
<P>The&s;e Advices were &s;till Seconded with others, till at last the <HI>French</HI> them&s;elves making it no longer a Secret, and &s;ome of the Men of War being ready, they Ordered the Stores, Arms and Ammunition to be actually Shipped on Board, drew their Troops down to the Shore, and Openly Declared that this Expedition was De&s;igned for <HI>Scotland,</HI> to Re-in&s;tate the King of <HI>Great Britain, So they Stiled the Pretender,</HI> in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Lawful <HI>Dominions,</HI> as <HI>they Called them,</HI> and this they &s;aid was done at the Earnest Request of his Subjects in that Kingdom.</P>
<P>It is true, and <HI>mo&s;t People thought it rea&s;onable to judge,</HI> that it was not probable, the King of <HI>France</HI> would Embark in a De&s;ign of &s;o Great Con&s;equence, had he not received Invitations from <HI>Scotland:</HI> Howe|ver, the De&s;ign not Succeeding, tho&s;e Corre&s;pondences never came to
<PB N="iii" REF="4"> be effectually di&s;cover'd; And therefore the <HI>Hou&s;e of Lords</HI> in their Addre&s;s to <HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI> take Notice, That the King of <HI>France</HI> making an Attempt to invade <HI>Her Maje&s;ties</HI> Dominions with &s;uch a contemptible Force, was a &s;ufficient Evidence that he must have Encouragment from &s;ome Per&s;on in <HI>Scotland</HI> di&s;affected to <HI>Her Maje&s;ties Government.</HI></P>
<P>However, The strictest Inqui&s;ition after the&s;e Corre&s;pondencies could never make any con&s;iderable Di&s;covery, tho many Per&s;ons were taken up, which &s;eemed to be owing rather to the Mi&s;carriage of the De&s;ign, the <HI>French</HI> never coming on Shore with any <HI>Forces,</HI> and their Friends on Shore being too politick to &s;how them&s;elves till they &s;aw their Troops on Shore, and in &s;ome Po&s;ture and Condition to protect them;&mdash;There were &s;everal Gentlemen taken up upon general Su&s;picions, which however it gave &s;ome Offence to the People, yet was thought nece&s;&s;ary at that time, <HI>of which by and by.</HI></P>
<P>About the End of <HI>February,</HI> the&s;e Preparations of the <HI>French</HI> were come to &s;uch a Height, and the De&s;ign of invading <HI>Scotland &s;o out of doubt,</HI> that the <HI>Government</HI> here thought it high Time to prepare for the Defence of <HI>Scotland:</HI> And to that Purpo&s;e, <HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI> wrote a Letter to the <HI>Privy Council</HI> in <HI>Scotland (which, tho determined to expire by an Act of Parliament, yet was in Being, and had Power to act, till the fir&s;t Day of</HI> May <HI>following.)</HI> In this Letter, <HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI> gave them Notice that &s;he had received Information of an <HI>Intended Inva&s;ion</HI> back'd with a <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Popi&s;h Power,</HI> de&s;ign'd again&s;t <HI>Scotland</HI> in Favour of the <HI>Pretender;</HI>&mdash;And therefore recommended to them the Security of the Kingdom, the Pre&s;ervation of the publick Peace, and that they would u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible Means to that Effect.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, Vigorous Preparations were made in <HI>England</HI> for preventing the De&s;igns of the <HI>French,</HI> as well by equipping a Fleet to inter|cept them at Sea, and &s;o prevent their Landing; as by providing Forces to give them a warm Reception, in ca&s;e they &s;hould land in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>I know there were Complaints made, and Endeavours u&s;ed to expo&s;e the Conduct of the <HI>Government</HI> in their Preparations; &s;ugge&s;ting, That due Care was not taken to put <HI>Scotland</HI> in a Po&s;ture of Defence in ca&s;e the <HI>French</HI> had landed: and a certain <HI>Noble Per&s;on</HI> cau&s;ed the Letters of the <HI>E.</HI> of <HI>Leven</HI> the <HI>General</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which were written in the mid&s;t of that <HI>Hurry,</HI> and in which his <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI> wrote in pre&s;&s;ing Terms for A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to be Printed;&mdash;But when the&s;e Things came to be Examin'd in <HI>Parliament,</HI> it appeared otherwi&s;e than tho&s;e Gentlemen repre&s;ented, and the <HI>Parliament</HI> receiv'd full Satisfaction, that all the Diligence was u&s;ed which the Nature of the Thing would admit,&mdash;<HI>But be that as it will,</HI> by the Event we found that <HI>Providence</HI> ble&s;&s;ed the Mea&s;ures taken, &s;o as that they not only prevented the Execution of the De&s;ign at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> but di&s;pirited the Party in &s;uch a Manner, that they durst not make the Attempt any where el&s;e, which they might have done with too much Effect, and might but too well have made them&s;elves Amends for the Di&s;appointment, by ruining the Country, and keeping the Affairs of <HI>Britain</HI> in longer Su&s;pence.</P>
<P>I &s;hall however, without meddling with the&s;e Di&s;putes which are dead with the Thing, &s;how by the meer Relation of Fact, That <HI>England</HI> was in no
<PB N="iv" REF="5">
Condition to have made any Preparation that could have been effectual to prevent the Landing of the French;&mdash;And thus all they had done, as to Stores, Magazines, or Arms, as the Thing then &s;tood, had been only leaving the greater Booty to the Enemy, and furni&s;hing them with Weapons to u&s;e against our &s;elves,&mdash;Since the Number of Troops, or the Condi|tion of the Fortifications of <HI>Scotland</HI> were &s;uch as could make no tolerable Re&s;i&s;tance, nor &s;o much as protect the Magazines, if any had been E|rected.</P>
<P>But to return to the Preparations made in <HI>England:</HI>&mdash;<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> with <HI>Incredible Celerity,</HI> all the Men of War that could be found in any Con|dition were fitted out, mann'd, and victualled in Order to put to Sea, and wait for the Enemies Fleet;&mdash;And the Expedition in this Ca&s;e was &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing, That the <HI>French</HI> who had been inform'd that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Navy was in no Condition to offer them any Di&s;turbance in their De&s;ign, and upon which Pre&s;umption, they own'd afterward they made their De&s;ign publick; found to their Di&s;appointment &s;ixteen <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men of War crui&s;ing before <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> before they (the <HI>French</HI>) were in any Condition to put to Sea&mdash;This however did not put a Stop to their De&s;ign,&mdash;but they went on with their Equipment; And their Fleet being ready, they embark'd their Troops about the fifth of <HI>March,</HI> their whole Force con&s;i&s;ting of <HI>Twenty eight Sail</HI> of <HI>Ships,</HI> whereof &s;ixteen were <HI>Men of War,</HI> and twelve were large <HI>Friggots</HI> or <HI>Privateers;</HI>&mdash;Their <HI>Land-Forces</HI> con&s;i&s;ted of 15<HI> French Battalions,</HI> and about 300<HI> Volunteers,</HI> the most part <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> being to &s;erve as <HI>Officers</HI> for the rai&s;ing <HI>New Regiments</HI> in <HI>Scotland;</HI>&mdash;The&s;e Forces being on Board with the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and &s;ome few <HI>Scots</HI> Gentlemen, particularly, the two Sons of the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Middletoun,</HI> with the Old Lord <HI>Griffin, &amp;c.</HI> They came out of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> about the &s;ixth of <HI>March,</HI> commanded by the <HI>French</HI> Admiral <HI>Mon&s;ieur Fourbin.</HI></P>
<P>In this Time the Diligence of our <HI>Admiralty</HI> was &s;uch, tho <HI>England</HI> was at that Time very bare of Ships, that the <HI>Engli&s;h Squadron</HI> before <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was made up to 36 Sail, including &s;ome <HI>Dutch Men of War,</HI> that had al&s;o joined them; And as the <HI>French</HI> Fleet lay in <HI>Newport Pits,</HI> watching an Opportunity to &s;ail, &s;o the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> lay off of <HI>Graveline,</HI> ready to &s;tart with them, and re&s;olv'd, <HI>if po&s;&s;ible,</HI> to engage them in their <HI>Pa&s;&s;age.</HI></P>
<P>However, The <HI>French</HI> tru&s;ting to their <HI>Canvas;</HI> the Cleanne&s;s of their <HI>Bottoms,</HI> and their <HI>Nimble Sailing,</HI> re&s;olved to put to Sea; tho, <HI>as it were,</HI> in &V;iew of a &s;uperior Force: And accordingly, the Wind blowing fre&s;h at <HI>North-we&s;t,</HI> they weighed and &s;et Sail;&mdash;The various Cour&s;e of the Fleets, and the Succe&s;s, as to the &s;ailing part, was the Sub|ject of much Di&s;cour&s;e: I &s;hall therefore be the Exacter in it, &s;ince it was wondred very much, how the <HI>French</HI> who lay in View of the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Fleet could &s;o get the Start of them, as to be at the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Edin|burgh</HI> about two Days before them; By which, had they not over&s;hot their Port, they might have fairly put their De&s;ign in Execution, not|with&s;tanding all the Power of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet at their Heels.</P>
<P>The Wind, as I noted before, blew at <HI>North-we&s;t,</HI> a fre&s;h Gale, and the <HI>French</HI> weighing upon the Top of High Water, went away with the
<PB N="v" REF="6">
Tide of Ebb to the <HI>North-</HI> ward, keeping the <HI>Dutch</HI> Coa&s;t on Board, which was then the Weather-Shore.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> lying in <HI>Gravling-Pits,</HI> had the following Di&s;advantages in the Pur&s;uit; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That it was about <HI>Eight Hours</HI> after the <HI>French</HI> were &s;ailed, before they could get Notice of it, and be under Sail.</P>
<P>It was indeed wondred at by &s;ome, why the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet knowing very well that the <HI>French</HI> were de&s;igned for <HI>Scotland,</HI> which was <HI>North:</HI> and that they lay in <HI>Newport</HI> Road, &s;hould <HI>them&s;elves</HI> ly in <HI>Graveling,</HI> which was at lea&s;t 25 Miles to the <HI>South;</HI>&mdash;By which Means, when ever the French &s;hould &s;ail, they would nece&s;&s;arily be-behind them a con&s;iderable Way.</P>
<P>But this is An&s;wered by the Sailers, and which I &s;hall not un|dertake to confute, <HI>viz.</HI> that it blew very hard, the Wind at <HI>North,</HI> and <HI>North</HI>-we&s;t: And there was no other Place where the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet could ride with Safety:</P>
<P>I &s;hall leave this Di&s;pute as I find it, and content my &s;elf with only naming it, as I &s;hall others that came after it.&mdash;</P>
<P>Be it as it will, the Matter of Fact was &s;o;&mdash;The <HI>French</HI> Fleet being &s;ailed about Eight Hours before,&mdash;Advice was brought to Sir <HI>George Bing,</HI> who weigh'd with all Expedition, and followed with all the Sail he could make.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George</HI> had al&s;o another Di&s;advantage, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>French</HI> &s;ailing with the first of the Ebb, he lo&s;t a Tide of them&mdash;So that in their fir&s;t Starting, the <HI>French</HI> had the Advantage of the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Fleet, as follows.&mdash;<LIST>
<ITEM>Eight Hours in Time,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Twenty five Miles in Space,</ITEM>
<ITEM>And the Ebb of the Tide.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>With the&s;e Helps, and having first left out the lower Tire of their Guns to make them Light for &s;ailing, their Ships being clean, and new fitted, the <HI>French</HI> Ships al&s;o being really better Sailers, generally &s;peaking, than ours: with the&s;e Helps, I &s;ay, they got a very great Start of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in their fir&s;t &s;etting out.</P>
<P>When they came to Sea, another Thing happened, which gave them ae yet farther Advantage of the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI>&mdash;The <HI>French</HI> Fleet kept a large <HI>Offing,</HI> as they call it, keeping to <HI>Windward</HI> all the Way rather nearer the <HI>German</HI> Coa&s;t than the <HI>Briti&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet bore away for their own Coast, and were &s;een off of <HI>Loe&s;tof</HI> and <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> and from the Shore of <HI>Norfolk.</HI></P>
<P>The Rea&s;ons for this different &s;haping their Cour&s;e &s;eem the&s;e;&mdash;The <HI>French</HI> were by all means po&s;&s;ible to avoid the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Shore, le&s;t they &s;hould be taken &s;hort by the Wind, and might be Embay'd, and con|&s;equently Overtaken, having a Superior Force behind them. Al&s;o it was not fit for them to be &s;een before they came to the <HI>Firth,</HI> that they might not give the <HI>Alarm</HI> to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to be ready for them.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> made their own Coast, le&s;t the <HI>French</HI> &s;hould fallin there with their <HI>Merchants,</HI> and &s;weep the Coa&s;t of their Ships: Which had they done, they might indeed have made great <HI>Havock.</HI></P>
<P>However it was, the&s;e Di&s;advantages gave the <HI>French</HI> &s;uch a Start of
<PB N="vi" REF="7">
the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that they were on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Scotland</HI> two Days before the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet, and had not <HI>Heaven</HI> blinded their <HI>Pilots,</HI> &s;o as to mi&s;s their Port, they might have put their De&s;ign in Execution in Spight of all our Forces.</P>
<P>On <HI>Friday March</HI> the 12<HI>th,</HI> they made the Coast of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but found them&s;elves the Hight of <HI>Montro&s;s,</HI> about fifteen Leagues to the North of the <HI>Mouth</HI> of the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI>&mdash;Here they made Signals, and &s;ome Boats going off to them, they were Informed where they were,&mdash;then they &s;tood away Southward, and &s;pent all that Day before they got to the <HI>Mouth</HI> of the <HI>Firth.</HI></P>
<P>Now they &s;ent one Ship, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Sali&s;bury,</HI> up the <HI>Firth,</HI> whether it was to make any Signal to their Party, to give Notice of their Coming, Or to get any Intelligence, remains yet Undetermined;&mdash;they made the <HI>Firth</HI> ju&s;t as the Tide was &s;pent, and were therefore Obliged to &s;pend &s;ix Hours more at Anchor, under the I&s;le of <HI>Maii</HI> in the <HI>Mouth</HI> of the <HI>Firth,</HI> and here, on the fourteenth early in the Morning, they find them&s;elves Overtaken, their <HI>Scouts</HI> Di&s;covering the <HI>Engli&s;h Fleet</HI> &s;tanding in for the <HI>Mouth</HI> of the <HI>Firth.</HI></P>
<P>Here then, they find their <HI>Enterpri&s;e</HI> at an End, their Moments are gone, in which they might have put their Errand in Execution,&mdash;and now they have no more to do, but to make the be&s;t of their Way to Sea.</P>
<P>Upon this, therefore they Weigh, and &s;tand away for the <HI>North,</HI> with all the Sail they can make, and the <HI>Engli&s;h Fleet</HI> after them.</P>
<P>The Foremost of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships came often within Gun&s;hot of them, but not &s;o many as could stop their <HI>Fleet,</HI> or bring them to Engage,&mdash;but they maintained a Kind of a Runing <HI>Fight</HI> with tho&s;e of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> that Pur&s;ued, in which little Harm was done on either Side, &s;ave that in the Night, one of their Ships being the <HI>Sali&s;bury,</HI> formerly taken from the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> fell in among the <HI>Engli&s;h Fleet,</HI> and being Surrounded was Taken.</P>
<P>With this Booty, and the <HI>French</HI> Out-&s;ailing the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> Sir <HI>George Bing</HI> having Pur&s;ued them to the North-east Point of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> Called <HI>Buchan-ne&s;s,</HI> &s;een them &s;everal Leagues to the North of that, and at last lo&s;t Sight of them, he returned to the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Edin|burgh;</HI> And keeping his <HI>Fleet</HI> in a Sailing Posture, with his <HI>Scouts</HI> continually Abroad to gain Intelligence of the <HI>Enemy,</HI> he continued in the <HI>Firth</HI> till the Begining of <HI>April;</HI> When the Government having Intelligence that the <HI>French</HI> were Returned into <HI>Dunkirk</HI> with their <HI>Fleet,</HI> Sir <HI>George Bing</HI> was al&s;o Ordered Southward with the <HI>Engli&s;h Fleet,</HI> and &s;o the whole War on that Side ended.</P>
<P>I come now to &s;peak a little of the <HI>Preparations</HI> made by the <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> by Land, in Order to Meet this New Eruption; &s;uppo&s;ing the <HI>French</HI> had Landed,&mdash;which indeed was not without Hazard.</P>
<P>In Order to this, &s;uch Troops as were at Hand, were immediately Ordered to March Northward, particularly they &s;ent away two Troops of the Queens Hor&s;e Guards, the Duke of <HI>Northumberland's</HI> Regi|ment of Hor&s;e, with the three Regiments of Dragoons of <HI>E&s;&s;ex, Raby</HI> and <HI>Carpenter;</HI> be&s;ides which, two Regiments of Dragoons, and one
<PB N="vii" REF="8">
Regiment of Hor&s;e were Ordered to March to the North of <HI>Ireland,</HI> to ly ready there, to be Embark'd on the first Orders.</P>
<P>Of Foot there were Thirteen Battalions then in <HI>England</HI> &s;ent for|wards, including the Queens Guards, and &s;ome new Rai&s;ed not quite Compleat, and Ten Battalions from <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be Noted, That as &s;oon as ever the Certainty of the De&s;ign|ed <HI>Inva&s;ion</HI> came to the Knowledge of the <HI>States,</HI> they Ordered Tran&s;ports immediately to Carry Ten Battalions of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Troops to <HI>England,</HI> to A&s;&s;ist the Queens Troops there; and when Sir <HI>George Bing</HI> Pur&s;ued the <HI>French Fleet,</HI> as above, he &s;ent <HI>Admiral Baker,</HI> with Twelve Men of War into <HI>Holland,</HI> to bring tho&s;e Troops away to <HI>New Ca&s;tle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne,</HI> that &s;o being Landed there, they might be ready to joyn the Land Army, and the Ships to joyn the Fleet.</P>
<P>The Forces being thus Appointed, Marched all Northward, but the Rendezvous was Appointed at <HI>York;</HI> For the Generals knowing the Troops in <HI>Scotland</HI> to be Weak, and not a&s;&s;ured how the People there would behave them&s;elves in general, had Re&s;olved not to March any Troops into <HI>Scotland,</HI> till the whole Army was A&s;&s;embled, that they might March in a Body&mdash;and to this Purpo&s;e the Earl of <HI>Leven,</HI> with the&s;e few Forces he had in <HI>Scotland,</HI> was Ordered, if he could not Prevent their Landing, to make his Retreat to <HI>Berwick.</HI></P>

<P>Be&s;ide which, the <HI>Dutch</HI> had prepared a Second Convoy to &s;end Over Twelve Battalions more, if there had been any Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>A Train of <HI>Artillery</HI> was preparing at the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and was in a Good Forwardne&s;s, &s;o as it might probably have been at the Rendezvous as &s;oon as the Troops could have well been Drawn toge|ther.</P>
<P>I have been the more Particular in this, becau&s;e I am Drawing every thing to the <HI>Reader's</HI> View, that he may judge of &s;ome Con|jectures, I &s;hall make concerning the Probabilities of the Succe&s;s of this <HI>Enterpri&s;e,</HI> and what might rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the I&s;&s;ue of it, &s;ince &s;ome People have been &s;o Weak, as to &s;ay, It had been Better for us to have let them come on <HI>Shore,</HI> and that we &s;hould immediately have Cru&s;ht and Defeated them.</P>
<P>It remains now, to Enquire how the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> behaved them&s;elves in this Critical Juncture, and what Condition they were in there, to have Received the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Condition of <HI>Scotland</HI> at that Time; it is to be Confe&s;t, the French had all the Encouragement imaginable, to make &s;uch an Attempt from the Circum&s;tances of the Place, and the Temper of the People: As to the Circumstances of the Place, 'tis Evident that the Country was intirely Naked, and in a manner Defencele&s;s.</P>

<ITEM>The &s;tanding Forces were few.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The <HI>Militia</HI> ju&s;t in the Middle, between Di&s;&s;olving the Old Model, and Erecting a New, &s;o as they were ab&s;olutely Di&s;|banded without Commi&s;&s;ions, without Officers, and without any Form.</ITEM>

It must be Confe&s;t, <HI>Never was Nation in &s;uch a Condition to be Invaded;</HI> And there is no Doubt, but had the <HI>French</HI> Landed their <HI>Forces,</HI> and got their Stores of <HI>Arms</HI> and <HI>Ammunition</HI> on <HI>Shore,</HI> as <HI>they might ea&s;ily have done, if they had not Over&s;hot their Port</HI>&mdash;They would with very little Oppo&s;ition have been <HI>Ma&s;ters</HI> of the whole <HI>Country.</HI></P>
<P>It may be thought by &s;ome remote to my Purpo&s;e to Demon|&s;trate this; But when I con&s;ider, what Differing Notions the People in <HI>England</HI> have of the Attempt of the <HI>French,</HI> and of their Succe&s;s in it; I can not think it an U&s;ele&s;s La|bour to give you a Brief E&s;&s;ay, at what the Event of that Enterprize might probably have been,&mdash;that &s;o we may &s;ee what we have to be thankful for.</P>
<P>I am now to &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>French</HI> Safe on Shore, their Magazine and Train of Artillery Landed, and the Earl of <HI>Leven</HI> the <HI>General for Her Maje&s;ty,</HI> Retreating towards <HI>Berwick,</HI> as he must undoubt|edly have done,&mdash;and <HI>as his Orders directed him to do</HI>&mdash;, without which his Retreat being Cut off, he must have been Surrounded and Taken, or have been Cut in Pieces, having no Place of Strength to Retreat to.</P>
<P>Had they been thus on <HI>Shore,</HI> there is no Doubt, but in two Hours they had been Ma&s;ters of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> an open City, and without De|fence; the <HI>Ca&s;tle</HI> indeed might have Held Out &s;ome Time, but the <HI>City</HI> could have made no Re&s;istance.&mdash;But that which was wor&s;e, the Circum&s;tances of the Time was &s;uch, and the People were &s;o Di|vided, that the <HI>City</HI> must have &s;ent down to <HI>Leith</HI> to have &s;ought Protection from the <HI>French</HI> against their own Rabbles, and they mu&s;t have De&s;ired the <HI>French</HI> to have Come and Taken them into their Protection, to have Pre&s;erved them from Plunder and Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>I think <HI>whatever the Rea&s;ons of this were,</HI> which I de&s;ire to bury in Silence, the Fact will be readily granted; and indeed all Men owned at that Time, that if the <HI>French</HI> Landed their Forces, they mu&s;t be Master of the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> without any Oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>It is true that I am now but upon Suggestion and meer Suppo&s;ition, and I do not Affirm po&s;itively; But I leave it to any Man to judge of Probabilities, and whether what I Sugge&s;t is Rational or no;&mdash;When the <HI>French</HI> were thus Po&s;&s;e&s;t of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> it is very rea&s;onable to Imagine that the fir&s;t Thing they would have done, was to <HI>Proclaim</HI> their <HI>King:</HI> If the Magi&s;trates of the <HI>City</HI> would not have Agreed to have Performed the <HI>Ceremony,</HI> the <HI>Tolbooth</HI> was near at Hand, and the <HI>Citizens</HI> being A&s;&s;embled, could &s;oon have Cho&s;en New <HI>Magi&s;trates,</HI> who would Chearfully have done it&mdash;.</P>
<P>Their King being Proclaimed, it &s;eems Rational to Suppo&s;e, they &s;hould next Summon the <HI>Inhabitants</HI> to take an <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Fidelity</HI> to him; Such as Refu&s;ed would have their <HI>E&s;tates Confi&s;cated,</HI> and perhaps be Impri&s;oned; and if they got Room to Flee, would have their Hou&s;es Plundred.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="11">
Being thus Ma&s;ters of the <HI>Capital,</HI> and the <HI>Queens</HI> Troops having Fled or Retreated towards <HI>Berwick,</HI> the Country expo&s;ed to their Power; I think I make no Tre&s;pa&s;s on good Manners or Ju&s;tice, if I &s;ay, The Northern <HI>High-landers</HI> would have been &s;oon Rai&s;ed by the Influence of their <HI>Superiors,</HI> who are for the mo&s;t part <HI>Jacobites,</HI>&mdash;The&s;e being in Arms, the <HI>Low-Lands</HI> are at their Mercy, and they had &s;oon Po&s;&s;e&s;t them&s;elves of the whole <HI>Country,</HI> the <HI>Militia</HI> being entirely without a <HI>Head,</HI> and without Order, Unlockt from the former Settlement; and Unfixt in a New.</P>
<P>Being thus Po&s;&s;e&s;t of the <HI>Low-Lands,</HI> they &s;oon would have been <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> of the whole <HI>Country;</HI> and indeed there was very Few that Dur&s;t &s;how their Faces again&s;t them, the Forwardne&s;s of One Party, and the Divi&s;ions and Di&s;orders of the Other making Way for it,&mdash;when they had thus Reduc'd the <HI>Low-Lands,</HI> they had no more to do, than to call a <HI>Convention</HI> of <HI>E&s;tates,</HI> as at the <HI>Revolution;</HI> and finding the&s;e Fa&s;t to their <HI>Intere&s;t;</HI> The fir&s;t <HI>Laws</HI> &s;hould be to Re|&s;cind the <HI>Revolution,</HI> Declare the <HI>Limited Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> a <HI>Vi&s;ible Re|bellion,</HI> and an <HI>Inva&s;ion</HI> of the <HI>Right</HI> of another&mdash;, and thus a compleat National Turn &s;hould have pa&s;s'd upon us&mdash;, and the <HI>Revo|lution</HI> &s;hould &s;uffer a <HI>Re-revolution</HI> in a few Weeks, <HI>for the&s;e things would require but little Time:</HI> Neither is it Pre&s;umption to Sup|po&s;e, they &s;hould have gotten a <HI>Repre&s;entative</HI> returned, that would have come into &s;uch Mea&s;ures, &s;ince they having the Ab&s;olute Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the <HI>Country,</HI> the Influencing them under &s;uch Circumstances, to the Choo&s;ing &s;uch Per&s;ons as they &s;hould think fit to put upon them was ea&s;ie enough,&mdash;In&s;tances of which have been but too Common in this <HI>I&s;land,</HI> under a le&s;s Tyrannical Power than a <HI>French</HI> Army.</P>
<P>While they were thus Settling their <HI>Civil Government</HI>&mdash;, Their <HI>Military Affairs</HI> could not have failed; the Inclination of the Common People about <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and the Influence of the <HI>Chiefs</HI> and <HI>Heads</HI> of <HI>Clans</HI> in the <HI>High-Lands,</HI> would have &s;oon furni&s;hed Men for New <HI>Revolutions,</HI>&mdash;The <HI>&s;ixteen</HI> Regiments which they brought with them, (&s;o it &s;eems they had determined) &s;hould have had <HI>two hundred</HI> Men added to every Regiment, by way of filling up&mdash;five Regi|ments of <HI>Dragoons,</HI> and <HI>fourty</HI> Battalions of <HI>Foot</HI> was to have been Rai&s;ed immediately&mdash;; The Command of the&s;e Troops was to be gi|ven to <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Officers, and of &s;uch, they brought great Numbers with them; &s;ave only that the <HI>Colonels</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Captains,</HI> were to be Cho|&s;en of the <HI>Superiors</HI> or <HI>Chiefs</HI> where they were Rai&s;ed, to Encourage the Rai&s;ing them.</P>
<P>Thus in le&s;s than &s;ix Weeks, they &s;hould have had 30000 Men added to the Troops they brought with them&mdash;; The Money they would have given the <HI>High-Land Gentlemen,</HI> would Effectual|ly have brought the&s;e <HI>Gentlemen</HI> to For&s;ake their Party, and Joyn with them, and then the De&s;ign would have gone on beyond Expectation.</P>
<P>We are next to Enquire what was to become of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prepa|ration all this while? You have heard what <HI>Strength</HI> they were of when come together; But it could not be po&s;&s;ible that they could be all brought together, their <HI>Magazines</HI> furni&s;hed, <HI>For the</HI> French <HI>would have taken Care, they &s;hould have Sub&s;i&s;ted ill enough in</HI> Scotland, <HI>Their</HI> <PB N="xi" REF="12"> Train of <HI>Artillery</HI> have been come up, and they in Condition to have Marched into <HI>Scotland</HI> in Battalia, as they mu&s;t have done, under &s;ix Weeks or two Months&mdash;; the Difficulties of the Roads, <HI>the Country being at that Time very Deep,</HI> and the Carriages Heavy, would have made it very bad, Marching an <HI>Army</HI>&mdash;; and the Want of <HI>For|rage</HI> would have made it Impracticable to have done it &s;ooner.</P>
<P>All this Time the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Jacobites</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> would have had, to have Strengthned their <HI>New Settlement,</HI> form'd their <HI>Army,</HI> Fortified <HI>Leith,</HI> and other Places, and have prepared for War.</P>
<P>I &s;hall readily Grant as any Body can de&s;ire, That when the <HI>Eng|li&s;h Army</HI> came to be ready, and to enter <HI>Scotland,</HI> they &s;hould Beat the&s;e <HI>New Invaders</HI> out of all; and that they &s;hould in Time pay Dear for the Attempt; But it mu&s;t be granted, this would have the&s;e Con&s;equences withal, 1<HI>.</HI> That it would have Ruin'd <HI>Scotland.</HI> 2. Brought the <HI>Seat</HI> of <HI>War</HI> home to our own Doors. 3<HI>.</HI> Cau&s;e a Di|ver&s;ion of our <HI>Forces,</HI> and be an Occa&s;ion of withdrawing our <HI>Troops</HI> from <HI>Flanders,</HI> where the <HI>Enemy</HI> felt the greatest Weight of the <HI>War</HI>&mdash;.

<P>I can not but take Notice here, of the <HI>Temper</HI> of the <HI>People</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> at this Time; none will Doubt, but the Minds of Men were variou&s;ly agitated as their &s;everal <HI>Tempers, Intere&s;t</HI> and <HI>Party</HI> guid|ed them&mdash;, <HI>Hope</HI> on one Side, and <HI>Fear</HI> on the other Di&s;covered it &s;elf in a manner which both Sides would fain have Concealed, nor was there wanting a <HI>Party</HI> who openly and avowedly, profest their De&s;ires to have the <HI>French</HI> Land, and their <HI>Re&s;olution</HI> to joyn with them, and this in &s;o Open, &s;o Rude, and &s;o Threatning a Manner, as gave ju&s;t Cau&s;e of <HI>Terror</HI> to the Honest Loyal <HI>Party</HI> on the other Hand, who &s;aw them&s;elves inevitably Ruin'd, <HI>if the</HI> French <HI>Landed,</HI> by their own Rabbles&mdash;, The other <HI>Party</HI> having openly Threatned and Mark'd out the <HI>Hou&s;es</HI> of &s;uch <HI>Families</HI> as were most Eminent for their <HI>Zeal</HI> to the E&s;tabli&s;h't <HI>Government.</HI></P>
<P>It was Expected, and indeed Apprehended very much in <HI>England,</HI> that tho&s;e of the <HI>Pre&s;byterians,</HI> who had before Vigorou&s;ly Appeared against the <HI>Union,</HI> and profe&s;t their Di&s;like of it upon all Occa&s;ions, would have Appeared against the <HI>Government,</HI> at this Juncture, and either have joyn'd with the <HI>Invaders,</HI> or have formed a Third <HI>Party,</HI> and &s;o have made a Divi&s;ion, which had in its Kind been equal|ly Fatal.</P>
<P>But in this al&s;o they were di&s;appointed, for the People who were most warm again&s;t the <HI>Union,</HI> nay even the <HI>We&s;tern Men</HI> who do not own or join with the <HI>Church,</HI> yet all as one Man declared again&s;t joining with <HI>French Invaders, Papi&s;ts,</HI> and a <HI>Returning Tyranny,</HI> which they ea&s;i|ly fore&s;aw mu&s;t be the Con&s;equence of an <HI>Inva&s;ion;</HI> And therefore lay|ing a&s;ide all their Old Animo&s;ities, private Grudges, and Cavils at the <HI>Union, &amp;c.</HI> They unanimou&s;ly declared their Re&s;olution to &s;tand toge|ther,
<PB N="xii" REF="13">
and with their Lives and E&s;tates to defend the <HI>Government</HI> and their <HI>Country</HI> again&s;t all the <HI>Powers</HI> of <HI>France</HI> and the <HI>Pretender;</HI> And to this End, they began to form A&s;&s;ociations, the Burghers of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> listed Men, and &s;ub&s;cribed, for their Maintenance, &s;ome 10, &s;ome 20, &s;ome more, and in other Places they were apreparing to do the like;&mdash;the <HI>We&s;tern Men</HI> &s;ent them Word they would come and join with them, <HI>if there was Occa&s;ion;</HI> And in the mean time &s;ome of the People called <HI>Cameronians</HI> made their open Prote&s;tation again&s;t it.</P>
<P>This was a very great Encouragment to the <HI>Government</HI> at that Time, when the Vaunts of the other Party run high, and their Hopes were great; But <HI>GOD</HI> in his <HI>Providence</HI> prevented the evil Con&s;equences of this Affair, as you have heard: and the good People who had made great Ap|pearances of <HI>Unanimity,</HI> found them&s;elves delivered another and an ea&s;ier Way.</P>

<P>The greate&s;t Part of all the <HI>Pre&s;byteries</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Synods,</HI> Addre&s;&s;ed the <HI>Queen</HI> al&s;o on the Subject of the <HI>Inva&s;ion;</HI> and the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly</HI> declared their Sentiments thereof, 1<HI>&s;t.</HI> In their <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to the <HI>Queens Letter.</HI> 2<HI>ly.</HI> In their <HI>Addre&s;s</HI> to <HI>Her Maje|&s;ty.</HI> And 3<HI>ly.</HI> In their <HI>National Thank&s;giving</HI> in&s;erted in their Printed <HI>Acts,</HI> pages 6, 8, 10, 12, 13.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all this, many <HI>Pari&s;hes</HI> drew up <HI>Addre&s;&s;es</HI> to the <HI>Privy Council,</HI> &s;hewing their <HI>Re&s;olution</HI> to venture their <HI>Lives</HI> and <HI>For|tunes</HI> in Defence of <HI>Her Maje&s;ties Per&s;on</HI> and <HI>Government;</HI> and Craving Leave to put them&s;elves in a <HI>Po&s;ture</HI> of <HI>Defence;</HI> and in many Places the <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> did Sub&s;cribe for con&s;iderable <HI>Sums,</HI> to be payed when called for, in order to buy <HI>Arms,</HI> and to maintain <HI>Men</HI> for the Ends fore&s;aid: Some Burgers in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> Sub&s;crib|ed to Maintain 50<HI> Men,</HI> &s;ome 40<HI>,</HI> &s;ome 30<HI>,</HI> &s;ome 20<HI>,</HI> and &s;ome who were Poorer Sub&s;cribed for Fewer, and all this was done by the Advice, and with the Allowance of Per&s;ons Intru&s;ted in the <HI>Govern|ment</HI> by <HI>Her Maje&s;ty.</HI></P>
<P>But this is not all, the Sea&s;onablene&s;s of this <HI>Solemn Fa&s;t</HI> was
<PB N="xiv" REF="15">
&s;uch, and &s;o Serviceable to the <HI>Government,</HI> being brought out at the very Juncture of Time, when the <HI>Eyes</HI> both of <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Enemies</HI> were upon them, that it mu&s;t be acknowledged, it &s;hewed not only the <HI>Zeal</HI> of the <HI>Pre&s;byterian Mini&s;ters</HI> for the <HI>Queen,</HI> the <HI>Government</HI> and their Establi&s;ht Intere&s;t; but it &s;hewed their <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Pru|dence</HI> in &s;o happily timing an Action of that Determining Con&s;e|quence, and taking the very Moment of its being mo&s;t Effectual, as well to Convince the <HI>Enemy,</HI> that they had nothing to expect that Way, but the whole United Force of the <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> again&s;t them&mdash;To &s;atisfy the <HI>Government</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, <HI>among whom Jealou&s;ies of the Contrary had been Indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread</HI>&mdash;, that the <HI>Pre&s;byterains,</HI> one and all would Declare again&s;t the <HI>Invaders;</HI>&mdash;<HI>as al&s;o,</HI> to Settle and Determin &s;uch among them&s;elves, <HI>if any &s;uch were,</HI> who might be otherwi&s;e unfix'd in their <HI>Re&s;olutions,</HI> and doubtful what <HI>Cour&s;e</HI> to take.</P>
<P>Nor was this all, but the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> in their re&s;pective <HI>Pari&s;hes,</HI> upon the Occa&s;ion of the &s;aid <HI>Fa&s;t,</HI> applyed them&s;elves to the Informing their <HI>People,</HI> what the real Views, and probable Con|&s;equences of this <HI>Attempt</HI> were, what was Threatned to their <HI>Church,</HI> to their <HI>E&s;tabli&s;ht Religion,</HI> to their <HI>Liberties,</HI> to their <HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> and to the <HI>Revolution;</HI> How, whatever the &s;pecious Pre|tences of Pre&s;erving the <HI>E&s;tabli&s;ht Church</HI> might be, <HI>Popery</HI> in Prin|ciple, and <HI>Tyranny</HI> in Practice were certainly Incompatible with the <HI>Prote&s;tant E&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which was Founded in <HI>Liberty,</HI> Depended upon <HI>Law,</HI> and could not Sub&s;ist, humanely &s;peaking, but upon the &s;upported Ba&s;is of <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Liberty</HI> together; That the <HI>In|va&s;ion</HI> was a Vi&s;ible Appearance of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Popi&s;h Tyranny,</HI> the &s;ame that for <HI>twenty eight</HI> Years, bad Influenced the <HI>Councils</HI> and <HI>Governments</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> while they Trampled on the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Silenc'd their preaching <HI>Mini&s;try,</HI> Per&s;ecuted and barba|rou&s;ly Murthered their <HI>Innocent Brethren,</HI> and bid Defiance to the <HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>GOD,</HI> and the <HI>Liberties</HI> of <HI>Scotland;</HI> that the&s;e <HI>Days</HI> would inevitably return upon them, and that all the <HI>Mi&s;eries</HI> they had for|merly felt, were Effectually contain'd in the Womb of an <HI>Inva&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>By this Method the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> opened-the <HI>Eyes</HI> of the whole <HI>Nation,</HI> and the <HI>People,</HI> Rous'd by this happy Vigour in their <HI>Clergy,</HI> began to Hir every where; Immediately a new Face appear'd upon the <HI>Publick Affairs,</HI> the General Dejection and He&s;itation, which &s;eemed before to make the <HI>People</HI> look Dark and Unre&s;olved, was quite Removed, and nothing was to be &s;een among the <HI>Pre&s;byterian Party</HI> of the <HI>People,</HI>&mdash;but <HI>A&s;&s;ociations, Addre&s;&s;es, Preparations</HI> for Fighting, fitting up their <HI>Arms,</HI> and a Chearful re&s;olved <HI>Temper</HI> of <HI>Fighting</HI> the <HI>French</HI> where-ever they were to be found.</P>
<P>Some of the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> them&s;elves were &s;o Vigorous in this, that they Cau&s;ed their whole <HI>Pari&s;hes</HI> to A&s;&s;ociate and Bind them&s;elves, One to another, and all together to the <HI>Government,</HI> to &s;tand as one Man against the <HI>Invaders.</HI></P>
<P>The Service this did the <HI>Government,</HI> the Encouragement it gave
<PB N="xv" REF="16">
in <HI>England,</HI> and the Di&s;couragement it gave to the <HI>Jacobite Party</HI> at that Juncture, was &s;uch, as the last e&s;pecially will not ea&s;ily forget;&mdash;and I thought it very U&s;eful to Tran&s;mit the <HI>Memory</HI> of it thus to <HI>Po&s;terity,</HI> that they may know how their <HI>Ance&s;tors</HI> Acted in this <HI>Great Affair;</HI> and how they ought to Act on the like Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>In this Po&s;ture the Affairs of this <HI>I&s;land</HI> &s;tood, when the <HI>French baf|fled by the immediate Hand of GOD's Providence, in mi&s;&s;ing their Port,</HI> were pur&s;ued by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet, and made their E&s;cape <HI>by the Goodne&s;s of their Sails</HI> to <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> where their <HI>Troops</HI> were put on Shore, <HI>and &s;o the Expedition ended.</HI></P>
<P>The ten <HI>Battalions</HI> which came from <HI>Holland</HI> to <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI> were not at all landed, but went immediately back, and were in the Field again Time enough to &s;how them&s;elves in the <HI>Fir&s;t of the Campaign</HI>&mdash;The <HI>Engli&s;h Troops</HI> march'd back without entring into <HI>Scotland;</HI> The Pri&s;oners taken on Board the <HI>Salisbury</HI> were brought to <HI>Hull,</HI> and treated as <HI>Pri&s;oners of War,</HI> in Order to be &s;ent over to <HI>Holland</HI> for Exchange.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Griffin,</HI> with the two Sons of the Earl of <HI>Middletoun,</HI> and 15<HI> Iri&s;h reform'd Officers</HI> were carry'd to <HI>London;</HI> The three fir&s;t were committed to the <HI>Tower,</HI> and the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> to <HI>Newgate,</HI> being to be Tryed, <HI>as Traitors,</HI> again&s;t the <HI>QUEEN,</HI> who&s;e natural born Subjects they appeared to be.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Griffin</HI> having been formerly attainted and outlaw'd, it need|ed not that he &s;hould be brought to any Tryal: but, <HI>being carryed up to the QUEEN's Bench Bar</HI> he received <HI>Sentence of Death</HI> on the Foot of the &s;aid Outlawry, <HI>without any Tryal;</HI>&mdash;However, the <HI>Dauphin of France</HI> having wrot a particular Letter in his Behalf, <HI>to the Duke of Marlborcugh</HI> to intreat the <HI>QUEEN's Mercy to him,</HI> and that he <HI>(the Dauphin)</HI> made it his Request to the <HI>Queen, the Lord</HI> Griffin <HI>being his Servant;</HI>&mdash;The &s;aid Lord <HI>Griffin</HI> was reprived from Time to Time, and is yet living <HI>in the Tower,</HI> at the publi&s;hing the&s;e Sheets.</P>
<P>The <HI>Iri&s;h Officers</HI> al&s;o, and the Lord <HI>Middletoun's</HI> Sons remain yet <HI>Pri&s;oners.</HI></P>
<P>On the other Hand, Great Heats and Di&s;putes happened about the Gentlemen who were taken up upon Su&s;pition.&mdash;</P>
<P>The Parliament, <HI>in the Heat of the Alarm,</HI> had pa&s;&s;ed a Bill &s;u&s;pen|ding the <HI>Habeas Corpus Act</HI> for a Time, &s;o far as &s;hould concern the Per&s;ons apprehended on this Account, and empowering the <HI>Queen</HI> to take up, and keep in Pri&s;on, &s;uch Per&s;ons as there &s;hould be Ground to &s;u&s;pect, were guilty of Confederating with, or Encouraging the <HI>In|vaders.</HI></P>
<P>Had the Gentlemen concerned, been apprehended in anyother Juncture, they would perhaps have had no other Trouble than to have lyen &s;till, and when the Thing had been over, have been relea&s;ed again, as was done at that Time in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>But the Fury of our Divi&s;ions on either Hand run &s;o high, that this could not be: Some thought the Per&s;ons taken up had more Hand in the <HI>Inva&s;ion</HI> than appeared, and that they ought not too lightly to be let go,
<PB N="xvi" REF="17">
left it might encourage both them and others to make the like Attempt a|gain.</P>
<P>And the&s;e were very warm for Pro&s;ecutions, and for propo&s;ing Rewards to encourage Per&s;ons to come in to charge the <HI>Pri&s;oners:</HI>&mdash;And would have all Manner of Methods tryed to fa&s;ten &s;omething upon them.</P>
<P>Others again <HI>Inveighed again&s;t the Mini&s;try</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as having partial and Party-Regards in the picking out <HI>&s;uch or &s;uch Per&s;ons</HI> to put in Pri&s;on, <HI>on Pretence of this Su&s;picion,</HI> as might gratifie the private De&s;igns of particular Per&s;ons, either as to <HI>Private Picks</HI> and <HI>Per&s;onal Revenge,</HI> or to prejudice their Interests in Elections, <HI>there being a new Parliament then to be cho&s;en.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Contentions, <HI>however grounded on either Side,</HI> had certainly this Effect, that they gave a great deal of Trouble to the <HI>Pri&s;oners,</HI> which otherwi&s;e might have been avoided; For the <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> &s;eeing &s;uch pointing at probable Guilt on one Hand, and &s;uch Complaints of Injustice on the other, found it nece&s;&s;ary to make the <HI>Proceedings more formal,</HI> and to have all the Gentlemen up to <HI>London,</HI>&mdash;That they might either be pro&s;ecuted, or let out upon <HI>Bail: as the Council &s;hould di|rect.</HI></P>
<P>&V;pon their coming up to <HI>London,</HI> they were all admitted to Bail, ex|cept <HI>Four</HI> who were committed to Pri&s;on, and were after &s;ent to <HI>Scot|land</HI> to be Tryed; but the&s;e however were acquitted, <HI>the Lords of the Ju&s;ticiary</HI> and <HI>Her Maje&s;ties Advocate</HI> differing upon &s;ome Forms; par|ticularly, the Lords refu&s;ing to admit the <HI>Lord Advocate</HI> to produce more Witne&s;&s;es&mdash;after the first Day of <HI>Tryal.</HI></P>
<P>It is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s to enter into this Di&s;pute, <HI>otherwi&s;e I could be more large on this Head:</HI>&mdash;But the <HI>Government was &s;o &s;en|&s;ible</HI> of the Inconveniencies of the old Method of pro&s;ecuting upon <HI>Trea|&s;on, from this Nicety,</HI> that pre&s;ently upon this the <HI>Parliament</HI> re&s;ol|ved to bring in a Bill to make the Laws for <HI>Tryals, in Ca&s;es of Trea&s;on,</HI> the &s;ame in <HI>Scotland</HI> as in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>From this Period is al&s;o to be dated the Di&s;tractions which followed in the Affair of Religion, <HI>and of which I think it is very material to &s;peak,</HI> becau&s;e they have made a great Noi&s;e in the World, <HI>and every one is not rightly appri&s;ed of the Thing</HI>&mdash;particularly many have enter|tained Prejudices again&s;t the good People in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as if they had been acted by a <HI>Spirit of Pa&s;&s;ion and Per&s;ecution,</HI> when indeed, upon a full and clear Examination of the Matter of Fact, the contrary will evident|ly appear; And therefore I could not &s;atisfie my &s;elf without do|ing this Piece of Ju&s;tice to the Church and People of <HI>Scotland,</HI>&mdash;as to give an impartial Relation of the Fact, as it is atte&s;ted out of the pub|lick Regi&s;ters, by the proper Officers: and being my&s;elf an Eye and Ear-Witne&s;s to every part of the <HI>Proceeding.</HI></P>
<P>About the End of <HI>February</HI> 1707/8, Her Maje&s;ty by Her Letter to the Privy Council in <HI>Scotland,</HI> gave Notice of the intended In|va&s;ion, back'd with a <HI>French</HI> Power, de&s;ign'd again&s;t <HI>Scotland;</HI> recom|mending to them the Security of the Kingdom, the Pre&s;ervation of the Publick Peace, and that they would u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible Means to that Effect.</P>
<P><PB N="xvii" REF="18">
The Privy Council taking this Affair into their Con&s;ideration, it natu|rally occur'd; That to di&s;courage the Enemies of the Government at Home, was <HI>among others,</HI> one of the be&s;t Steps to prevent the mi&s;chiev|ous Con&s;equences of an <HI>Inva&s;ion</HI> from Abroad; and in order to this, that it was rea&s;onable to &s;uppre&s;s the publick Meetings of tho&s;e, who under pretence of Divine Wor&s;hip, admitted &s;uch Ministers to officiate, as the Law in that Ca&s;e had prohibited, having not qualifyed them&s;elves by tak|ing the Oaths, praying for the Q&V;EEN, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by which the Publick Di&s;affection was upheld and encourag'd.</P>
<P>It was then agreed to <HI>Nemine Contradicente,</HI> in the Privy-Council; <HI>and for the Truth of which we refer our Reader to the Minutes of the Council for Proof;</HI> That Orders &s;hould be I&s;&s;ued out to all inferiour Magi&s;trates, to put this Re&s;olve in Execution; and Orders were accord|ingly I&s;&s;ued out to the Magistrates of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> for that Purpo&s;e, who thereupon Legally called before them &s;everal Ministers or Preachers, who were known to keep Publick Meeting-Hou&s;es within their Bounds&mdash;Asking them plainly in Terms of Law, If they prayed for Her Maje&s;ty <HI>NOMINATIM,</HI> in their Publick Meeting-Hou&s;es; and if they had qua|lifyed them&s;elves by taking the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Allegiance,</HI> and &s;ub&s;cribing the &s;ame with the <HI>A&s;&s;urance,</HI> as the Law requir'd?</P>
<P>Some of them an&s;wer'd directly, but others avoiding the Que&s;tion, re|quir'd a Legal Tryal, by way of Libel and Proof; which was accordingly Appointed, and whereof the preci&s;e Points were, their not taking the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Allegiance,</HI> and &s;ub&s;cribing the &s;ame with the <HI>A&s;&s;urance;</HI> their not praying for Her Haje&s;ty <HI>NOMINATIM,</HI> as the Law requires; and their not ob&s;erving <HI>Publick Fa&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Thank&s;givings;</HI> all which were Notour, and being <HI>Negatives</HI> proved them&s;elves.</P>
<P>To this Libel the fore&s;aid Preachers made An&s;wers, and al&s;o took a Protest, That they were not legally cited, not being call'd either on fifteen Days as the old Law requires, or on ten Days, as the late Act of Parlia|ment again&s;t <HI>Intruders</HI> pre&s;cribes.</P>
<P>To which it was An&s;wered, That as to the fifteen Days, the known and perpetual Custom within Burgh had over-ruled it to <HI>twenty four</HI> Hours; and as to the ten Days, they were only appointed in the Tryal of <HI>Intruders.</HI> But the Preachers call'd, being conveen'd for notour Di&s;affection by not Praying, and by not taking the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Allegiance,</HI> nor keeping <HI>Fa&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Thank&s;givings,</HI> the <HI>Citations</HI> were good, and the <HI>Procedure</HI> un|que&s;tionable; and yet the <HI>Magi&s;trates</HI> thought fit to give them a farther <HI>Indulgence,</HI> and to allow them to give in all their <HI>Defences.</HI></P>
<P>The Sum of which <HI>Defences,</HI> as contain'd in a <HI>Repre&s;entation</HI> exhibit by the &s;aid <HI>Preachers,</HI> being first the fore&s;aid <HI>Dilators</HI> to this, they added, That by the <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> 1693, Requiring all <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> and <HI>Preachers</HI> to take the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Allegiance,</HI> It is provided, that the <HI>Contraveener</HI> &s;hall be Puni&s;h'd by Bani&s;hment, or otherways as the <HI>Privy-Council</HI> &s;hould think fit, and therefore the <HI>Libel</HI> was improperly tabled before the <HI>Magi&s;trates.</HI></P>
<P>It was An&s;wer'd, To the <HI>fir&s;t Dilators,</HI> that the former <HI>An&s;wers</HI> were repeated; And to the <HI>&s;econd,</HI> That the <HI>Privy-Council</HI> having
<PB N="xviii" REF="19">
refer'd the Execution to the <HI>Magi&s;trates,</HI> there could be no more <HI>De|bate</HI> about their <HI>Competency</HI> on that <HI>Head.</HI></P>
<P>But then they went on to Object again&s;t the Relevancy. And as to the <HI>Act</HI> of the <HI>Convenion,</HI> Ordaining all <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> to Pray for the KING and QUEEN <HI>Nominatim,</HI> They An&s;wer'd, That that <HI>Act</HI> did die and expire with King <HI>WILLIAM</HI> and Queen <HI>MARY.</HI> And as to the <HI>Act</HI> 1693, Ordaining all <HI>Preachers</HI> to take the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Allegiance,</HI> and Sign the &s;ame with the <HI>A&s;&s;urance;</HI> They An&s;wer'd, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That that <HI>Act</HI> did only concern <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> provided to Benefices and Stipends; and could not be extended to &s;uch <HI>Preachers,</HI> as enjoy no Benefice under the <HI>Government;</HI> And <HI>Secondly,</HI> The <HI>Act</HI> Recog|nizing Her Maje&s;ty Queen <HI>ANNE,</HI> enjoyns the Taking of the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Allegiance,</HI> &amp;c. to &s;uch as are in publick Tru&s;t, and <HI>Preachers</HI> not benefic'd cannot be &s;aid to be in any publick Trust; And <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> 1693, limited to the Per&s;ons of King <HI>WILLI|AM</HI> and Queen <HI>MARY,</HI> is out of Doors with them.</P>
<P>To which it was Reply'd, That the <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Convention,</HI> Ordaining all <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> and <HI>Preachers</HI> to Pray for the KING and QUEEN <HI>No|minatim,</HI> is certainly to be understood likeways, of all their Royal Suc|ce&s;&s;ors, &s;pecially &s;ince it is &s;o plainly founded upon the Command of the <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> and the Duties of all <HI>Subjects. Secondly,</HI> The <HI>Act</HI> 1693, expre&s;ly relates to all <HI>Preachers,</HI> whether Benefic'd or not, and withal defines all <HI>Preachers</HI> to be Per&s;ons in publick Tru&s;t; &s;o that the <HI>Act</HI> recognizing Her Majesty did exactly fall within it, and affords no Relief to the <HI>Defenders.</HI> And <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The <HI>Act</HI> 1693, tho' it men|tion King <HI>WILLIAM</HI> and Queen <HI>MARY,</HI> yet is not limited to them, but being a perpetual Law, extends to all their Royal <HI>Succe&s;&s;ors;</HI> Likeas by the &s;aid <HI>Act</HI> recognizing Her Maje&s;ty, it is <HI>de facto</HI> &s;o ex|tended.</P>
<P>Which <HI>Defences</HI> and <HI>Replies</HI> being Read and Con&s;idered by the <HI>Magi&s;trates,</HI> they repell'd the <HI>Dilators,</HI> as al&s;o all the other <HI>Defences</HI> proponed for the <HI>Defenders,</HI> and found, that &s;ince they had not Pray'd for Her Majesty Queen <HI>ANNE, Nominatim,</HI> and taken the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Allegiance, &amp;c.</HI> they had incur'd the Pains of Law, and therefore Ordain'd them, and every one of them, to de&s;ist from keeping of any Meeting-Hou&s;es within the City of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and Liberties thereof, and from Preaching or Exerci&s;ing any Part of the <HI>Mini&s;terial Functi|on</HI> within the &s;ame in Time coming, under the Pain of Impri&s;onment, and to find Caution for that Effect betwixt and the 30<HI>th</HI> Day of <HI>March</HI> then in&s;tant, and in the mean Time that their <HI>Meeting-Hou&s;es,</HI> be forthwith &s;hut up. But tho' this <HI>Sentence</HI> was then pa&s;t, yet nothing follow'd upon it, until that the <HI>Privy-Council</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> being de|termin'd by an <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> after the 1st of <HI>May,</HI> the&s;e Di&s;|affected <HI>People</HI> judging, that the <HI>Councils</HI> Orders were al&s;o ex|pir'd with the <HI>Council</HI> that gave them, did about the 20<HI>th</HI> of <HI>June</HI> fall again to their <HI>Preaching,</HI> and enter'd their <HI>Meeting-Hou&s;es.</HI> And further they re&s;olv'd among them&s;elves, that they would continue to Preach and not De&s;ist; which mov'd the <HI>Magi&s;trates</HI> to renew the former <HI>Prohibition</HI> about the &s;aid 20<HI>th</HI> of <HI>June</HI> last, which they &s;till
<PB N="xix" REF="20">
Neglecting and De&s;pi&s;ing, they were again call'd before the <HI>Magi&s;trates</HI> about the 16<HI>th</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> and requir'd to find <HI>Caution</HI> or <HI>Bail</HI> to <HI>De&s;i&s;t,</HI> as being the known legal Execution upon &s;uch prohibitory Sentences, or otherways to go to <HI>Pri&s;on.</HI> But they still refu&s;ing to obey, the <HI>Magi&s;trates</HI> thought fit on the 13<HI>th</HI> to &s;end Five only to <HI>Pri&s;on,</HI> which Five were al&s;o at length reliev'd; &s;o indulgent were the <HI>Magi&s;trates</HI> in this Matter.</P>
<P>This whole <HI>Trial,</HI> and all the Steps thereof, being tran&s;mitted to <HI>Her Maje&s;ty,</HI> it plea&s;ed <HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI> by Her Royal Letters under Her Hand and Seal of the 18<HI>th</HI> of <HI>September</HI> la&s;t, to approve what was done by the <HI>Magi&s;trates</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> in the &s;aid Matter, as ac|ceptable Service; and further to judge it nece&s;&s;ary for the Safety of Her <HI>Royal Per&s;on</HI> and <HI>Government,</HI> that all &s;uch <HI>Meeting-Hou&s;es</HI> in every other Place &s;hould be &s;hut up.</P>
<P><HI>Thus far the Matter of Fact.</HI></P>
<P>It is most true, that in this first <HI>Pro&s;ecution,</HI> there was no other or further <HI>De&s;ign,</HI> than the giving a <HI>Check</HI> to the <HI>Inva&s;ion,</HI> and to the <HI>In&s;olence</HI> of &s;ome of the <HI>non jurant Party,</HI> who at that Time began to be more formidable in <HI>Scotland</HI> than in <HI>England;</HI> and this is apparent in the Lenity and Forbearance of the <HI>Magi&s;trates</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tices</HI> of the <HI>Peace</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who as &s;oon as the <HI>Inva&s;ion</HI> was over, and the <HI>Danger</HI> from abroad &s;eem'd at an <HI>End,</HI> were very ea&s;y with them again, the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> who had been Confined were &s;ilently let go, and their former <HI>Liberty</HI> conniv'd at again; &s;o that their <HI>Meetings</HI> became as frequent as they were before, notwithstanding they still re|fu&s;ed to take the <HI>Oaths,</HI> or Pray for the <HI>QUEEN.</HI></P>
<P>But here it began to appear, that there were &s;ome among tho&s;e <HI>People,</HI> who had other <HI>Aims</HI> in the&s;e things, than meerly the <HI>Liberty</HI> of their <HI>Con&s;ciences,</HI> and the <HI>Wor&s;hiping GOD</HI>&mdash;; and that &s;ome|thing ought to be attempted to make the <HI>People Unea&s;y,</HI> and to bring them by <HI>Force</HI> to Pro&s;ecute and Attack them.</P>
<P>And to this End, &s;ince refu&s;ing the <HI>Oaths,</HI> &s;ince refu&s;ing to Pray for the <HI>QUEEN,</HI> nay actually praying for the <HI>PRETENDER,</HI> would not provoke the <HI>Government,</HI> and <HI>Magi&s;trates</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>Per&s;ecute</HI>&mdash;; They find out another <HI>Expedient,</HI> which they are a&s;&s;ured will not fail, being what they know the <HI>Scots</HI> will not bear, what ever it Co&s;t them; and this was Erecting the <HI>Common Prayer</HI> or <HI>Engli&s;h Liturgy</HI> in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>People</HI> that made this <HI>Attempt,</HI> behoved to get &s;ome Body to do it; that however <HI>Jacobite</HI> he might be in <HI>Principle,</HI> was yet La|titudinarian enough in <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> that he could &s;wallow all the <HI>Oaths</HI> which &s;hould be offered to him&mdash;; Indeed &s;ome of the <HI>Jacobite Clergy</HI> were &s;o hone&s;t, that as they would not take the <HI>Oaths,</HI> &s;o they did not approve of this <HI>Attempt,</HI> but openly Di&s;avowed it&mdash;; Nor had the <HI>Epi&s;copal People</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> ever &s;et up the <HI>Engli&s;h Li|turgy,</HI> altho they had Reign'd in <HI>Scotland</HI> for <HI>twenty eight</HI> Years to|gether, before the <HI>Revolution.</HI></P>
<P>But the De&s;ign being concerted, they found a Tool; a <HI>poor Curate</HI> of 15 <HI>lib.</HI> a Year in <HI>Ireland,</HI> but born in <HI>Scotland,</HI> comes over to 
<PB N="xx" REF="21">
<HI>Edinburgh</HI> to mend his <HI>Commons;</HI> and having taken the <HI>Oaths,</HI> he falls in with this <HI>Party,</HI> who finding him a Per&s;on of pro&s;tituted <HI>Morals,</HI> a large Stock in the Face, and ready, if well paid, to do their Work, they promi&s;e him <HI>Four&s;core Pound</HI> a Year, and accordingly begin a <HI>Sub&s;cription</HI> for it.</P>
<P>Some <HI>Engli&s;h Gentlemen</HI> had, it &s;eems, promi&s;ed him &s;ome <HI>En|couragement</HI> towards that <HI>Sum</HI> to be rai&s;ed&mdash;, and this they make a Handle of pre&s;ently, and Reported that this was &s;et up to Accom|modate the <HI>Engli&s;h Strangers</HI> who could not Conform to the <HI>Pre&s;by|terian Church.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Engli&s;h Gentlemen</HI> &s;eeing into the De&s;ign, and that they were to be made a Property to Embroil the <HI>Government,</HI> and foment a <HI>Divi&s;ion</HI> between the Two lately <HI>United Nations;</HI> They &s;oon aban|doned him and his <HI>De&s;ign</HI>&mdash;; However, he re&s;olved to put his <HI>Project</HI> in Execution, and accordingly takes a <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> ju&s;t at the <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> fits it put for a <HI>Chapel,</HI> and begins to Read the <HI>Engli&s;h Service.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>People,</HI> as every Body knew they would, immediately took Fire at the thing&mdash;; But not doing him the Honour to Rabble him, <HI>which &s;eem'd to be what his Party expected;</HI> they Complain to the <HI>Magi|&s;trates</HI>&mdash;; The Per&s;on that had let him the <HI>Hou&s;e,</HI> finding what U&s;e he was putting it to, began with him, and <HI>on Pretence of his having made &s;ome Spoil in pulling down Partitions,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>not Autho|rized by his Contract</HI>&mdash;, Gets him Turn'd out of the <HI>Hou&s;e,</HI> and &s;o he betakes him&s;elf to a Place le&s;s publick, but &s;till goes on with his <HI>Service-Book Wor&s;hip;</HI> However it gave le&s;s Offence here, the other &s;eeming to be a Defyance of the <HI>Laws;</HI> It happened at this Time, or in a few Days after, that the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> of the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly</HI> was to meet&mdash;, as &s;oon as they &s;at down, a <HI>Repre&s;entation</HI> or <HI>Addre&s;s</HI> is made to them by the <HI>Inhabitants</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> and other Places again&s;t this thing; The <HI>Paper</HI> mentions other <HI>Complaints</HI> indeed, but this was the Main Thing aim'd at&mdash;; The <HI>Addre&s;s</HI> is as follows.</P>

<P>He Declined their <HI>Authority,</HI> Treated them with <HI>Contempt,</HI> Re|fu&s;ed to <HI>Appear</HI> at their <HI>Sub&s;equent Citation</HI>&mdash;, they took no far|ther Notice of him, but &s;ent a <HI>Copy</HI> of their <HI>Sentence</HI> to the <HI>Magi&s;trates</HI>

<P>I think, while I am in this <HI>Argument,</HI> Addre&s;&s;ing my &s;elf prin|cipally to the People of <HI>England,</HI> and among them to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI>&mdash;, I can do nothing better, than bring their own Practice to a Parallel with the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as a strong and convincing Way of arguing, <HI>to them e&s;pecially,</HI> in the Ca&s;e I am upon; <HI>And Fir&s;t,</HI> I take the Authority of the <HI>Parliament</HI> of <HI>England</HI> again&s;t <HI>Per&s;e|cution,</HI> in the great <HI>Act</HI> for Settlement of the <HI>Toleration,</HI> where it is &s;aid, <HI>Whereas it is rea&s;onable, that all ju&s;t Tenderne&s;s &s;hould be &s;hown to Tender</HI> Con&s;ciences, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Then in the <HI>Preamble</HI> of the late famous <HI>Occa&s;ional Bill,</HI> are the&s;e words, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Whereas</HI> Per&s;ecution <HI>for</HI> Con|&s;cience <HI>&s;ake, is contrary to the Principles of the</HI> Christian Religion, <HI>and the</HI> Doctrine <HI>of the</HI> Church <HI>of</HI> England.</Q>Take the&s;e two, and compare them with the <HI>Act 1. WILLIAM</HI> and <HI>MARY Cap.</HI>&mdash;. <HI>By</HI> which all tho&s;e <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks</HI> who would not take the Oaths, are Depo&s;ed and Deprived <HI>ab Officio &amp; Beneficio;</HI> and it will nece&s;&s;arily follow, at lea&s;t in my Opinion, that either the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> in Depo&s;ing the <HI>Non Jurant Clergy</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> acts <HI>contrary to her own</HI> Doctrine <HI>and the Principles of the</HI> Chri&s;tian Religion, <HI>ut &s;upra: OR,</HI> That Depo&s;ing and Depriving the <HI>Non Jurant Bi&s;hops,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Is not</HI> Per|&s;ecution <HI>for</HI> Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>I humbly refer this to the <HI>Determination</HI> of all that &s;hall Read im|partially if it be not clear and fairly &s;tated.</P>
<P>If then Depo&s;ing and Depriving the <HI>Clergy</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> who refufe to take the <HI>Oaths</HI> to the <HI>Government,</HI> be not <HI>Per&s;ecution;</HI> it remains for the other Party to prove, that the &s;ame thing in <HI>Scotland</HI> can be called <HI>Per&s;ecution,</HI> and in <HI>England</HI> no <HI>Per&s;ecution.</HI></P>
<P>The Depo&s;ing <HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI> it &s;elf in <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;eems to come in Que|stion here, and would require a long Di&s;cour&s;e&mdash;; But as I am &s;peaking chiefly to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> in this Ca&s;e, I am very wil|ling to make her a Judge&mdash;, and I pre&s;ume it will be arguing <HI>ad ho|minem,</HI> to &s;ay, tho' I do not lay the Stre&s;s here neither.</P>
<P>That Depo&s;ing <HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and Depo&s;ing <HI>Popery</HI> in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> stand in many Ca&s;es upon the &s;ame Foot&mdash;, and the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> has offered little or no <HI>Violence</HI> to the <HI>Epi&s;copal Church</HI> in <HI>Scotland;</HI> But what the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> has offered to the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> in <HI>England</HI>&mdash;: Now tho' in General this would be no Argument, yet 'tis a Rea&s;on in this Ca&s;e, why the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> above all other, ought not to charge the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> with <HI>Per&s;ecution</HI> in that particular&mdash;. But to go further, the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> did not immediately pull down <HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI>&mdash;,
<PB N="xxv" REF="26"> I mean, the <HI>Church</HI> ab&s;tractly con&s;idered in her <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> Circum|stances&mdash;; But it was done by the <HI>Government</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Body of the People, I mean the <HI>Parliament</HI> before the <HI>Presbyterian Church</HI> was Establi&s;hed&mdash;. And it is evident <HI>by the Claim of Right,</HI> that <HI>Epi&s;co|pacy</HI> was turn'd out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> not as a thing E&s;tabli&s;ht, but as an <HI>Intrud|er</HI> upon the E&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>Religion,</HI> which <HI>Scotland</HI> had from the very <HI>Re|formation</HI> Embrac't, which they had Sworn in their <HI>National Cove|nant</HI> to maintain, and which by <HI>Law</HI> it was their Right to restore; in &s;hort <HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI> was turn'd out as a Man who has had his Estate ta|ken from him by <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion,</HI> recovers his <HI>Right</HI> by <HI>Law,</HI> and then Di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the wrongful <HI>Incroacher</HI> or <HI>Invader,</HI> and enters upon his own.</P>
<P>&V;niver&s;al <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> will allow, That the <HI>Scots</HI> Reform'd first into the <HI>Geneva</HI> Model, by the Agency of the famous <HI>John Knox</HI> and others, and that they had no <HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI> in their fir&s;t <HI>E&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> at all; nor can all the Labour that has been &s;pent to make the <HI>Superintendents,</HI> who were &s;ent into the &s;everal Parts of the Kingdom, to &s;ettle <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tick</HI> Affairs, <HI>look like Bi&s;hops</HI>&mdash;, for this will for ever &s;upercede that Sugge&s;tion, <HI>viz.</HI> That the&s;e <HI>Superintendents,</HI> tho' Ve&s;ted with <HI>Power</HI> over the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> they went to Vi&s;it&mdash;, yet received that <HI>Power</HI> from, and exerci&s;ed it in Subordination to the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly</HI> of the <HI>Presbyterian Church</HI>&mdash;, and were often called to an Account, Cen&s;ured, and Removed by the <HI>Synods,</HI> nay and &s;ome &s;ay, even by pri|vate <HI>Presbyteries,</HI> See <HI>Calderwood's Hi&s;tory of the Church of</HI> Scotland <HI>Fol.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> being thus &s;uppo&s;ed an <HI>Invader</HI> and <HI>Spoiler,</HI> the <HI>Revolution</HI> did no more than take from them their u&s;urped <HI>Authority,</HI> cau&s;e them to Di&s;gorge what they had mo&s;t unjustly devoured, and the <HI>In|vader</HI> having thus been turned out, the right <HI>Owners</HI> of the <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> came again, and took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their own; <HI>And this can by no means be called</HI> Per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>My &s;econd <HI>Enquiry</HI> is upon <HI>a new Di&s;pute,</HI> and I think admits of no Difficulties in Matters of <HI>Law,</HI> whatever it may in Matters of <HI>Con|&s;cience</HI>&mdash;viz. <HI>Whether the Depo&s;ed Exauctorate</HI> Bi&s;hops <HI>have</HI> Power <HI>left to Ordain</HI> Mini&s;ters&mdash;? Indeed the Que&s;tion &s;eems rather to ly here, Whether &s;uch <HI>Preachers</HI> as &s;hall be Licen&s;ed or Ordain|ed by the Exauctorate <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> ought to be e&s;teem'd as <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> e&s;pe|cially in that <HI>Church</HI> which has &s;o Depo&s;ed them&mdash;? This being the pre&s;ent Debate, it rather re&s;pects the <HI>Civil</HI> than <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tick</HI> Part of the Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to me highly ab&s;urd, that the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> &s;hould receive as a <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> among them, a Man Ordain'd <HI>BY HIM WHOM</HI> they will not owne or receive as a <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> of their <HI>Church;</HI> for if the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> after Deprivation &s;hall Ordain <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> how then is that <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> Deprived <HI>AB OFFICIO</HI>&mdash;? Nor indeed do I know that the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> has at all admitted this Ab&s;urdity among them&mdash;; The thing is only &s;tarted in <HI>Scotland</HI> to beget new Broils on that Head, and it &s;eems &s;till more ab&s;urd, that the <HI>Non Jurant Bi&s;hops</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould have <HI>Power</HI> to Ordain a <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But to &s;upport this Ab&s;urdity, a wor&s;e is &s;tarted among us, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Epi&s;copal Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> is Incorporated into the <HI>Church</HI> of 
<PB N="xxvi" REF="27">
<HI>England</HI> by the <HI>UNION,</HI> and this is the <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> of my Third <HI>En|quiry.</HI> 
<LIST>
<ITEM>3. <HI>Whether the</HI> Epi&s;copal Church <HI>of</HI> Scotland, <HI>and the pre&s;ent</HI> Establi&s;ht Church <HI>of</HI> England, <HI>are at all of</HI> Kin, <HI>or no?</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>This <HI>Enquiry,</HI> if it be directly Trac'd, will lead to a New <HI>Que&s;ti|on, viz.</HI> What is to be Meant by the <HI>Church of</HI> England? <HI>I mean in this Que&s;tion onely</HI>&mdash;, and therefore I &s;hall <HI>An&s;wer</HI> it both Ways very briefly.</P>
<P>If by the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> we mean, The <HI>Church</HI> as now Esta|bli&s;h'd, or rather Recognized by the <HI>Revolution</HI>&mdash;, and now <HI>Re|ceiv'd</HI> and <HI>Acknowledged</HI> by the <HI>QUEEN</HI> and <HI>Parliament;</HI> Then indeed this pretended <HI>Incorporation,</HI> is an <HI>Ab&s;urdity</HI>&mdash;, and there is no more any &s;uch thing, than there is an <HI>Incorporation</HI> between <HI>GOD</HI> and <HI>Baal;</HI> for the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> &s;o <HI>Under&s;tood</HI> has &s;pued the other out as <HI>Illegal,</HI> has Rejected Her as <HI>Jacobite,</HI> and has Joyn'd in and Con&s;ented to <HI>by the UNION,</HI> the <HI>E&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> of the <HI>Pre&s;|byterian Church</HI> in her Stead, and upon her Ruines, as the <HI>True Pro|te&s;tant Religion,</HI> and <HI>E&s;tabli&s;ht National Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland, vide</HI> the <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>UNION,</HI> and from this Stipulation, &s;he (the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI>) her &s;elf, can not go back&mdash;; But if on the other Hand, by the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> is to be under&s;tood the <HI>Dodwellian-Jaco|bite-Faction</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> who refu&s;e to own either the <HI>Religous</HI> or <HI>Civil E&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> now Reigning in <HI>Britain,</HI> e&s;teeming the QUEEN an <HI>U&s;urper,</HI> the <HI>Revolution</HI> a <HI>Rebellion,</HI> and the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England Schi&s;matical</HI>&mdash;, if <HI>thus they Under&s;tand</HI> the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> then they and the <HI>Epi&s;copal Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> may for ought I know, be <HI>Incorporated</HI> into each other, and may be esteemed <HI>One Body</HI>&mdash;; and <HI>they are welcome to be &s;o accounted:</HI> But how this is done by the <HI>Union,</HI> remains for tho&s;e <HI>Gentlemen</HI> who pretend to it to make <HI>Out.</HI></P>
<P>I think, I need not De&s;cend to many <HI>Arguments</HI> in this <HI>Ca&s;e,</HI> the <HI>Ca&s;e</HI> is evident, the <HI>Epi&s;copal Church</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> being entirely <HI>Ja|cobite</HI> at this Time, can not be &s;aid to <HI>Incorporate</HI> with the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> who Acknowledge <HI>Queen ANNE,</HI> becau&s;e they <HI>Reject</HI> Her as <HI>Schi&s;matical</HI> and <HI>Apo&s;tate</HI>&mdash;, and that they can <HI>Reject</HI> Her, and be <HI>Incorporated</HI> into Her at the &s;ame Time, &s;eems <HI>Impracticable</HI> and <HI>Ab&s;urd.</HI></P>
<P>It remains to Enquire, <HI>whether</HI> Epi&s;copacy <HI>and the</HI> Engli&s;h Liturgy <HI>may not be Tolerated in</HI> Scotland&mdash;; and here I &s;hall wave the various <HI>Arguments</HI> about the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> and <HI>Obligation</HI> which lyes on all <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> to pay <HI>Reverence</HI> to <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> and in Order to give all po&s;&s;ible <HI>Liberty</HI> to <HI>Religious Opinions</HI>&mdash;; but I &s;hall lay the <HI>Stre&s;s</HI> of my pre&s;ent <HI>Arguing</HI> another way.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Speaking of <HI>Scotland,</HI> we are to Distingui&s;h between Tolerat|ing of <HI>Epi&s;copacy,</HI> and Tolerating of <HI>Jacobiti&s;m</HI>&mdash;, and if this be Distingui&s;ht right here, we &s;hall have little need of the <HI>Que&s;tion</HI> at all&mdash;; And in the Name of the <HI>Scots,</HI> I may very well &s;ay to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI>&mdash;, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> when you plea&s;e to Tolerate <HI>Jacobiti&s;m</HI> by <HI>Law</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> we will Con&s;ider of Tolerating <HI>E|pi&s;cpacy</HI>
<PB N="xxvii" REF="28"> in <HI>Scotland</HI>&mdash;, and this way of <HI>Arguing</HI> &s;eems very ju&s;t, becau&s;e if you plea&s;e to Ab&s;tract <HI>Jacobiti&s;m</HI> from <HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI> in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> you will leave no <HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI> there, but what is already To|lerated by <HI>Law</HI>&mdash;, <HI>viz.</HI> by the <HI>Act</HI> the fir&s;t <HI>Perliament</HI> WIL|LIAM <HI>and</HI> MARY, which Ordained that all tho&s;e <HI>Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters</HI> who would take the <HI>Oaths</HI> &s;hould Continue in their <HI>Churches</HI>&mdash;, <HI>and there they remain to this Day,</HI> a kind of <HI>Toleration</HI> much Superior to that in <HI>England,</HI> for the&s;e Enjoy the <HI>Pre&s;byterian Stipends</HI> and <HI>Man&s;es</HI>&mdash;, and in &s;ome of their <HI>Pari&s;hes</HI> the <HI>E&s;tabli&s;ht Church Mi|ni&s;ters</HI> Preach by them in <HI>Meeting Hou&s;es</HI> to this Hour, as Mr. <HI>Ponton</HI> in <HI>Kinghorn,</HI> and others, if the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> will not call this <HI>Toleration,</HI> they will find it hard to tell us what is <HI>Toleration.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Champions</HI> of this <HI>Toleration Project,</HI> finding this <HI>Argument</HI> turned too Hard upon them&mdash;, have &s;et up a New One&mdash;, and which therefore I have added in the <HI>Que&s;tion,</HI> and this is about Tolerat|ing the <HI>Common-Prayer Book</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI>&mdash;, and this brings a New <HI>Di&s;pute</HI> upon the <HI>Stage</HI>&mdash;, a <HI>Di&s;pute</HI> that &s;eems to have more <HI>Policy</HI> than <HI>Religion</HI> in it, and I doubt not but it will &s;oon be Detected.</P>
<P>That this is not a <HI>Ca&s;e</HI> of <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> but a <HI>Party Trick</HI> to Em|broil, will appear, if we Con&s;ider two or three Things.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That for <HI>twenty eight</HI> Years preceeding the <HI>Revolution,</HI> when the <HI>Epi&s;copal Church</HI> was (humanely &s;peaking) Tri|umphant in <HI>Scotland,</HI> they never admitted of the <HI>Engli&s;h Liturgy</HI> among them; nor was it ever Attempted for 100 Years before, but once by Arch-bi&s;hop <HI>Laud</HI> and his <HI>Party,</HI> which <HI>Attempt</HI> was the <HI>Overthrow</HI> of all the <HI>Contrivers,</HI> and it is more than Probable may be &s;o again, if they go on with it; This proves it is not any part of the <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion</HI> of the <HI>Epi&s;copal Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI>&mdash;, and therefore can not be &s;aid to be Demanded in behalf of <HI>Con&s;cience.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. From the <HI>Revolution</HI> to the Time of the <HI>Union,</HI> during which Time the <HI>Epi&s;copal non-jurant Clergy</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> have Erected &s;everal <HI>Meetings</HI> or <HI>Conventicles</HI> of their Party for <HI>Re|ligious Wor&s;hip</HI>&mdash;, they have had very little Thought of the <HI>Engli&s;h Liturgy,</HI>&mdash;but what of it is come among them, is a meer <HI>Innovation</HI> thru&s;t in upon them by the Artifice of a <HI>Party,</HI> in part to claim <HI>Kindred</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and partly to Inflame and Enrage the <HI>People</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who they know are <HI>Aver&s;e</HI> to it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. At this Time, while the <HI>Leaders</HI> of the <HI>Party</HI> are Impo|&s;ing this upon the <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>People</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI>&mdash;; They have &s;ome Difficulty to make their own <HI>People</HI> Agree to, and E&s;pou&s;e it&mdash;, the thing is &s;o far from being De&s;ired by the <HI>People</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that even the&s;e who frequent their <HI>Meetings,</HI> that are <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> in <HI>Religious Principles,</HI> and <HI>Jacobite</HI> in <HI>Politick Principles,</HI> yet Shun the <HI>Liturgy,</HI> Di&s;like it&mdash;, and are with <HI>Difficulty</HI> and <HI>Reluctance</HI> brought to bear it; nay in mo&s;t Parts they will not <HI>Comply</HI> with it, but <HI>Abandon</HI> tho&s;e that Read it, and Throng after tho&s;e <HI>Epi&s;copal Ministers</HI> that Decline it.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="xviii" REF="29">
The&s;e are Sufficient to make it appear, that the <HI>Attempt</HI> of Erecting the <HI>Common Prayer-Book</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> is not founded in the <HI>Con&s;ci|ences</HI> of the <HI>People</HI>&mdash;, That it is a <HI>Politck De&s;ign</HI> to carry on a <HI>Par|ty Intere&s;t</HI> among us in <HI>England,</HI> and Embroil, if po&s;&s;ible, the <HI>People</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> with the <HI>Government,</HI> is evident from the last <HI>Head,</HI> that they are at Pains to bring their own <HI>People</HI> to E&s;pou&s;e it, which if it were not to Serve their <HI>Civil Intere&s;t,</HI> it will be hard to Sugge&s;t on what <HI>Foundation</HI> they make the <HI>Attempt.</HI></P>
<P>But I come next to <HI>Enquire</HI> into the <HI>Civil Rights</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> as they stand, either <HI>Supported</HI> or <HI>Invaded</HI> by this <HI>Attempt</HI>&mdash;; if then the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> has a <HI>Civil Right</HI> to the <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Immunity</HI> &s;he Enjoys, and that the <HI>Union</HI> had Confirmed the&s;e <HI>Rights,</HI> then nothing can be Impo&s;ed upon her, again&s;t her pre&s;ent <HI>Settlement,</HI> without Breach of the <HI>Union:</HI> And this I pre&s;ume to &s;ay, No <HI>Hu|mane Authority</HI> now E&s;tabli&s;ht in <HI>Britain,</HI> can &s;o much as Attempt without <HI>Di&s;&s;olving</HI> the very <HI>Con&s;titution.</HI></P>
<P>By the <HI>UNION</HI> then, and the &s;everal <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> for the <HI>Security</HI> of the <HI>Pre&s;byterian Church,</HI> which are Confirmed by, and made <HI>Part</HI> of that <HI>Union</HI>&mdash;; The <HI>Purity</HI> and <HI>Uniformity</HI> of the <HI>Wor&s;hip, Di&s;cipline</HI> and <HI>Government</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> is to be Pre&s;erved <HI>to the People of</HI> Scotland WITHOUT ANT AL|TERATION, Mark the&s;e <HI>Words,</HI> I Repeat them again, WITHOUT ANT ALTERATION to all <HI>Succeeding Generations.</HI></P>
<P>If any Man will &s;ay, That Tolerating the <HI>Common Prayer</HI> can Con&s;ist with <HI>Pre&s;erving</HI> the <HI>Uniformity</HI> of the <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI>&mdash;, or the Tolerating <HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI> can Con&s;ist with the pre&s;erving the <HI>Government</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> or either of them with Pre&s;erving the <HI>Di&s;cipline;</HI> then I may be ready to Enquire further.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, if they are not, then they cannot be offered to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland;</HI> nor can even the <HI>Parliament</HI> of <HI>Britain</HI> Erect &s;uch a <HI>Toleration</HI> without <HI>Invading</HI> the <HI>UNION,</HI> which I hum|bly conceive they have not <HI>Power</HI> to do.</P>
<P>Nor can the <HI>Church</HI> or <HI>People</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> legally give their <HI>Con&s;ent</HI> to any &s;uch <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Toleration;</HI> becau&s;e this <HI>Purity</HI> and <HI>Uniformity</HI> is to be <HI>Pre&s;erved</HI> to all <HI>Succeeding Generations;</HI> and the pre&s;ent <HI>Ge|neration</HI> has no more <HI>Power</HI> to give up what by the <HI>Union</HI> is thus En|tailed on their <HI>Po&s;terity,</HI> than the <HI>Parliament</HI> can give up what is Conceded to the &s;aid Pre&s;ent Generation.</P>
<P>By this it &s;eems, the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> is &s;o Establi&s;hed, that neither can her <HI>Enemies</HI> Impo&s;e <HI>Toleration</HI> upon her; neither can her Treacherous or Negligent <HI>Friends,</HI> too many of whom &s;he may have <HI>in Power,</HI> give up her <HI>Claim</HI> to her <HI>E&s;tabli&s;hment;</HI> neither can &s;he her &s;elf Abandon her <HI>Right</HI> to, or her <HI>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion</HI> of her <HI>E&s;ta|bli&s;hment,</HI> Exclu&s;ive of all manner of <HI>Innovations</HI> or <HI>Inva&s;ious</HI> on the <HI>Purity</HI> and <HI>Uniformity</HI> of her <HI>Wor&s;hip, Di&s;cipline</HI> or <HI>Government.</HI></P>
<P>This I think is the pre&s;ent State of the <HI>Que&s;tion</HI> about <HI>Toleration</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> what Glo&s;s the Artifice of <HI>Enemies,</HI> and the Craft of <HI>Parties</HI> may put upon the <HI>Attempts</HI> now making, of Invading the <HI>Pri|vileges</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> I have nothing to do with in

<P>Two Things I find fall naturally in our Way as <HI>Objections</HI> (in <HI>England e&s;pecially,</HI>) when we <HI>argue</HI> again&s;t Tolerating the <HI>Engli&s;h Liturgy</HI> in <HI>Scotland; Fir&s;t,</HI> That this is falling upon the <HI>Common Prayer Book,</HI> and In&s;ulting the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI>&mdash;; And <HI>Secondly,</HI> That this will be Injurious to the <HI>Toleration</HI> which the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> Enjoy in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>It is mo&s;t certain in strict Ju&s;tice, That tho' both the&s;e were true, it makes nothing to the <HI>Argument.</HI> The <HI>Que&s;tion</HI> is not of Civility to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> or of Prudentials to the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> but of <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI>&mdash;, We are here in a <HI>Right</HI> of <HI>Property</HI> Capitulated for by the <HI>UNION,</HI> Sti|pulated for, and Agreed to by the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> that <HI>no Alte|ration</HI> &s;hall be made; that the <HI>Purity</HI> and <HI>Uniformity</HI> &s;hall be Pre|&s;erved: Either it is Pre&s;erved, or it is not&mdash;; If the <HI>Common Prayer</HI> be Impo&s;ed on them; If <HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI> be Tolerated, their <HI>Wor|&s;hip</HI> and <HI>Government</HI> is Altered, or it is not&mdash;; if it be, then the <HI>Union</HI> is Invaded, or it is not; the <HI>Que&s;tions</HI> are &s;hort, and need no Cavilling&mdash;, tho' &s;peaking of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> The <HI>Scots</HI> may be Civil to one, and Careful of the other; yet they must not give up their <HI>E&s;tabli&s;ht Rights</HI> on that Score, this were to Complement them at too great an <HI>Expence</HI>&mdash;: Would the <HI>Con&s;cientious Epi&s;copal People</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> be Ea&s;y, no <HI>Body</HI> Molested them, they Enjoyed their <HI>Liberty</HI> Unmole&s;ted enough, and in a manner which the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in <HI>England</HI> for many Years would have Rejoyc'd at&mdash;; but when nothing will Satisfy, but <HI>Encroach|ing</HI> upon <HI>Declared</HI> and <HI>E&s;tabli&s;ht Rights,</HI> the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> is then bound to A&s;&s;ert her own <HI>Property,</HI> and neither the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> or the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> ought to take it ill from them.</P>
<P>But after all, the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> have no Rea&s;on to <HI>take it ill,</HI> that the <HI>Scots</HI> do not make U&s;e of the <HI>Common Prayer,</HI> any more than the <HI>Scots</HI> have to <HI>take it ill,</HI> that the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> do not make U&s;e of the <HI>Pre&s;byterian Di&s;cipline;</HI> They are two <HI>National Churches;</HI> Either of them have their re&s;pective <HI>Kingdom</HI> to which they belong, <HI>Con&s;titution</HI> on which they are built, and <HI>Laws</HI> by which they are Establi&s;ht; They are perfectly <HI>Independent</HI> one of another, and have no <HI>Superiority</HI> over, or <HI>Subjection</HI> to one another&mdash;, They are <HI>Confederated</HI> by the <HI>UNION,</HI> and the <HI>Butts</HI> and <HI>Bounds</HI> of their re&s;pective <HI>Influence,</HI> are <HI>Stated</HI> and Irrever&s;ibly <HI>Determined,</HI> I &s;ay, they are but Confederated, <HI>for it is no more,</HI> the <HI>Kingdoms</HI> are <HI>In|corporated,</HI> but the <HI>Churches</HI> are but <HI>Confederated;</HI> but the <HI>Links</HI> of this <HI>Chain</HI> are &s;o nicely Twisted together, that the <HI>Confederacy</HI> can not be <HI>Broken</HI> withouthout <HI>De&s;troying</HI> the <HI>Incorporation,</HI> and the One is the <HI>Bond</HI> of the Other&mdash;; It can then be no <HI>Affront</HI> to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> to have the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;ay, We will have nothing to

do with your <HI>Common Prayer</HI>&mdash;, Nor to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to have the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> &s;ay, We will have nothing to do with your <HI>Pre&s;byterian Di&s;cipline</HI>&mdash;: It was the Great <HI>Preliminary</HI> of the <HI>Treaty,</HI> That the <HI>Churches</HI> of either <HI>Kingdom,</HI> &s;hould have nothing to do with One Another&mdash;; And therefore the <HI>Treaters</HI> on both Hands, were expre&s;ly Forbid to Meddle with the <HI>Affair</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI>&mdash;, who&s;e <HI>E&s;tabli&s;hments,</HI> it was found ab&s;olutely Nece&s;&s;ary &s;hould not in the least Interfere with One Another&mdash;, nor their re&s;pective <HI>Juri&s;diction</HI> be Suffered to <HI>Incroach</HI> upon, or <HI>Invade</HI> One the Other. If any have Rea&s;on therefore, to <HI>take ill</HI> any thing from the Other, the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> has the fir&s;t <HI>Offence</HI> given her, by this <HI>Attempt</HI> of <HI>In|vading</HI> her <HI>Uniformity;</HI> Only this is to be &s;aid for it, That it is the <HI>Act</HI> and <HI>Deed</HI> of a <HI>Party,</HI> not of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> Con&s;i|dered as a <HI>Church.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>Danger</HI> to the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> with Re&s;pect to the <HI>Tolerati|on</HI> they now Enjoy in <HI>England</HI>&mdash;; The <HI>Fears</HI> of that &s;eem to be altogether Groundle&s;s, to any Man that Rightly <HI>Under&s;tands,</HI> either the Nature of the <HI>Toleration</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> or the <HI>State</HI> of the <HI>Que&s;tion</HI> concerning <HI>Toleration</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI>&mdash;, in which it is Mani|fe&s;t, that the <HI>Difference</HI> is &s;o Wide, that no <HI>Argument</HI> can be drawn from the One to the Other, either to <HI>Strengthen</HI> or <HI>De&s;troy.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> Oppo&s;e a <HI>Toleration</HI> by a <HI>Claim</HI> of <HI>Right,</HI> &s;tipulated be|tween the Two <HI>Nations,</HI> and it is evident&mdash;, when the <HI>Act</HI> for <HI>Se|curity</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> was pa&s;t in <HI>Scotland</HI>&mdash;, this very Matter of <HI>Toleration</HI> was not a little Debated, and the <HI>Pre&s;byterian Oppo&s;ers</HI> of the <HI>UNION</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> were not Backward to expre&s;s their Apprehen&s;ions of a <HI>Toleration</HI> being Brought upon them by the <HI>UNION</HI>&mdash;, They were <HI>An&s;wered</HI> by the <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Security,</HI> which was &s;uppo&s;ed, believed, and intended to be Effectual again&s;t <HI>&s;uch a Thing</HI>&mdash;, and had they not thought it Sufficient, but in&s;i&s;ted in <HI>Words</HI> at length, That <HI>the</HI> Engli&s;h Liturgy <HI>&s;hould not have been Tolerated,</HI> or at all U&s;ed in <HI>Scotland</HI> in Publick. I may Appeal to all the <HI>Gentle|men</HI> Concern'd, either in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or here in <HI>England,</HI> That it would not have been Denyed&mdash;; And the <HI>Author</HI> of this is Witne&s;s to <HI>Large A&s;&s;urances</HI> given to this Purpo&s;e; but it was thought Mode&s;ter to &s;et it down in le&s;s pointed Terms&mdash;, no Man Doubting but that an <HI>Article</HI> to Pre&s;erve the <HI>Uniformity</HI> of <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI> in the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> WITHOUT ANY ALTERATION in all <HI>Succeeding Genera|tions,</HI> mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to contain a Sufficient <HI>Security</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h Liturgy.</HI></P>
<P>Now it would &s;eem a very Gro&s;s <HI>Sugge&s;tion,</HI> and Reproach the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> with &s;trange <HI>Inju&s;tice,</HI> to allege that they &s;hould Di&s;continue their <HI>Toleration</HI> to <HI>Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> be|cau&s;e they them&s;elves, having Con&s;ented to the <HI>Exclu&s;ion</HI> of <HI>Epi&s;co|pacy</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> hold them to their <HI>Bargain.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the <HI>Toleration</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> would <HI>the</HI> Di&s;&s;enters <HI>&s;ee their own Right to it,</HI> has a Legal <HI>Claim,</HI> and a <HI>Capitulation</HI> al&s;o on which it is Founded, and can not without Manife&s;t <HI>Inju&s;tice</HI> be Invaded by the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> but to Invade it, becau&s;e the <HI>Scots</HI> will not Tolerate <HI>Epi&s;copacy,</HI> which they (the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>) Con&s;ented &s;hould
<PB N="xxxi" REF="32">
not be Tolerated, would be a double <HI>Inju&s;tice,</HI> and is a <HI>Reproach</HI> to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> &s;o much as to imagine.</P>
<P>I think this Argument needs no further Di&s;cour&s;e&mdash;; The <HI>Scots</HI> do in&s;ist upon it, that by the <HI>UNION</HI> they ought not, and by tha <HI>Con&s;titution</HI> of their <HI>Church</HI> they can not admit the <HI>Common-Prayer Book</HI> to be publickly u&s;ed in <HI>Scotland</HI>&mdash;; and tho&s;e that offer it to them, know the People there will by no means bear it&mdash;, I am loath to &s;ay that's the chief <HI>Motive</HI> of the <HI>Attempt.</HI></P>
<P>Several other <HI>Di&s;putes</HI> happned in <HI>Scotland</HI> after the <HI>UNION,</HI> which can not be brought into the Compa&s;s of a <HI>Preface,</HI> and mu&s;t be refer'd to the fur|ther <HI>Hi&s;tories</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>Times</HI>&mdash;; As the <HI>Act</HI> for making the <HI>Trials</HI> in Ca&s;es of <HI>High Trea&s;on,</HI> the &s;ame in both <HI>Countries</HI>&mdash;; Occa|&s;ioned, as is Noted before, by the <HI>Di&s;putes</HI> which happened at the <HI>Trials</HI> of the four <HI>Gentlemen</HI> brought from <HI>England</HI> on the <HI>Inva&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>The Ca&s;e of the <HI>Drawbacks</HI> on <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> Cured with <HI>Foreign Salt Im|ported</HI> between the making the <HI>UNION,</HI> and the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> which being a <HI>Debate</HI> that can never happen again, is not Material; only to Note, that tho' the <HI>Intent</HI> and <HI>Meaning</HI> of the <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>UNION,</HI> was not for them, nor indeed the <HI>Equity</HI> of the Ca&s;e&mdash;; For they could not be &s;up|po&s;ed to <HI>Drawback</HI> what they never paid, yet the Letter of the <HI>UNION</HI> being for them, the <HI>Parliament</HI> Voted them their <HI>Money,</HI> which was a <HI>Te&s;timony</HI> of the Regard the <HI>Briti&s;h Parliament</HI> always have, and mu&s;t always have to the <HI>UNION;</HI> The Ca&s;e in &s;hort was this,</P>
<P>By the Eighth <HI>Article</HI> of the <HI>UNION,</HI> &s;everal <HI>Allowances</HI> are made, as <HI>Drawbacks</HI> upon <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> Cured in <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Exported</HI> again&mdash;; The rea&s;on of this <HI>Allowance,</HI> was, becau&s;e the Salt with which they are Cured paying a great <HI>Duty</HI>&mdash;, that <HI>Duty</HI> ought to be drawn back upon <HI>Exportation</HI>&mdash;; Now between the Ratifying the <HI>Treaty</HI> and the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> when it was to take Place, a very great Quantity of Foreign Salt <HI>(French)</HI> was <HI>Imported,</HI> which by the pa&s;&s;ing all the <HI>Goods</HI> &s;o <HI>Imported</HI> as before, paid none of the <HI>Engli&s;h Duties</HI>&mdash;. Now it was alledged, that as the <HI>Duty</HI> did not <HI>Commence</HI> upon the <HI>Salt,</HI> &s;o the <HI>Drawback</HI> ought not to <HI>Commence,</HI> which was the <HI>Effect</HI> of that <HI>Duty</HI>&mdash;; But the Letter of the <HI>Act</HI> being expre&s;s <HI>Article</HI> the <HI>VIII. That all</HI> Fi&s;h <HI>Cured with Foreign</HI> Salt <HI>&s;hall Drawback,</HI> &amp;c. The <HI>Parliament</HI> Voted it, and <HI>Scotland</HI> got about Twenty Seven Thou&s;and Pound <HI>Sterling Drawback,</HI> where they paid little or nothing of <HI>Duty.</HI></P>
<P>I do not remember any thing Material that happened in this <HI>Inter|val,</HI> more than what has been hinted at here&mdash;; The <HI>Parliament</HI> of <HI>BRITAIN</HI> went on to Ea&s;e the <HI>Scots</HI> in every Thing that came be|fore them, and except the <HI>Act</HI> above-mentioned about <HI>Trea&s;on,</HI> I know nothing that past again&s;t the <HI>Joynt Opinion</HI> of the <HI>Scots Mem|bers</HI> in Two <HI>Se&s;&s;ions</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> which have &s;at before the writing the&s;e <HI>Sheets.</HI></P>
<P>I have now, only a few things to take notice of here, relating to the <HI>Performance</HI> of the <HI>Work</HI>&mdash;, which I mu&s;t make &s;ome <HI>Apology</HI> for, and which &s;hall clo&s;e this <HI>Preface.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A GENERAL HISTORY OF UNIONS IN BRITAIN.</HEAD>
<P>IN order to come to a clear Under&s;tanding in the whole Frame of this wonderful Tran&s;action, THE UNION, 'tis ne|ce&s;&s;ary to let the Reader into the very Original of it, and Enquire where the fir&s;t Springs are to be found, from whence this mighty Tran&s;action has been Form'd.</P>
<P>And tho' this will of cour&s;e lead us back a great way into Hi&s;tory, yet it will carry this Advantage along with it, that we &s;hall &s;ee all the &s;everal Steps which have been taken, how Providence has led the Nations, as it were, by the Hand, and brought them by the Hints of their mutual Di&s;a&s;ters, to &s;eek this Treaty, as the only Harbour the Ship of the State could &s;afely come to an Anchor in.</P>
<P>Nor is it unworthy Ob&s;ervation, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e who love to remark the Connection of Providences in the Affairs of this World, and the various Turns the I&s;land of <HI>Britain</HI> has had in the Compa&s;s of a few pa&s;t Years; All which have had their direct Tendency to this great Event, tho' perfectly Unfore&s;een, either by the Actors or the Lookers on in tho&s;e Ages.</P>
<P>The Animo&s;ities between the&s;e two Nations, would require a great deal of Time and Art to De&s;cribe, they are not &s;o remarkable for their Antiquity and Original, as for their Nature and Circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>Never two Nations that had &s;o much Affinity in Circum&s;tances, have had &s;uch Inveteracy and Aver&s;ion to one another in their Blood.</P>
<P>They have been both the Inhabitants of the Riche&s;t, the Beauti|fulle&s;t, &amp; mo&s;t populous I&s;land in the World. And by frequent mutual
<PB N="2" REF="35">
Inva&s;ions made upon them, by the &s;ame Foreign Nations, who have left their Race behind them, it is not at all an Excur&s;ion to &s;ay, They are the &s;ame in Blood, of the &s;ame Off-&s;pring, and became Inhabitants the &s;ame way.</P>
<P>If it be Objected, That the North and North-We&s;t Parts of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> are <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> and retain both the Sirnames, Manners, and Language of the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> or the Ancient <HI>Scoti,</HI> from whence the whole Kingdom had its Name; It is al&s;o An&s;wered, &s;o has <HI>England</HI> in <HI>Wales, Cornwal,</HI> &amp; <HI>We&s;tmorland</HI> the Ancient <HI>Britains,</HI> who retain their Sirnames, Manners and Languages, as di&s;tinctly as the Highlanders in the North, or the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> in the I&s;lands of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>But take the South Part of <HI>Scotland,</HI> on this fide the <HI>Tay,</HI> the In|habitants, <HI>tho' very Ancient,</HI> mu&s;t be allowed to be the Remains of the <HI>Roman</HI> Colonies, afterwards of the <HI>Danes,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Saxons;</HI> and among all the&s;e, the <HI>Picts,</HI> who we &s;uppo&s;e, to have been the An|cient Inhabitants.</P>
<P>'Tis true, <HI>England</HI> is much more mixt in Blood, and the Rea&s;on of this is plain, in that, being a Nation powerful in Wealth, Fruit|ful in Soil, and above all, increa&s;ing in Commerce, more Nations have &s;ought to &s;ettle among them, numbers of People have flowed in upon them, from all Parts of the World, and blending their Blood with the mo&s;t ancient Families, have de&s;troyed all that can be called National, as to Antiquity among them, and they do not pretend to it.</P>
<P>Whereas in <HI>Scotland,</HI> under all the Mixtures they have &s;uffered, their ancient Families &s;eem to have been pre&s;erved, and Foreign Nations have only &s;eemed to increa&s;e their Number.</P>
<P>However this be, there is Nearne&s;s of Blood enough, I mean as to Originals, to have occa&s;ioned &s;ome Propen&s;ity to Coalition, and mutual Neighbourhood between the Nations; &amp; one would have thought, &s;ome happy Accident might have fallen out, &s;ome Lucid Interval, &s;ome convenient Cri&s;is of Circum&s;tances, or Juncture of Inclination, to have brought them together, made them fa&s;t Friends, and &s;o have joyn'd their victorious Arms, to the Terrour of their Neighbours.</P>
<P>But the Rancor has run in the Blood, the Hatred between the Nations, has lookt like a meer Original, a &s;ort of Antipathy, Here|detary from Generation, Born with the very Nations, and has long Threatned us with being too fa&s;t rooted there, ever to be remov'd, but <HI>like a malignant rank Lepro&s;ie,</HI> by pulling up Foundations.</P>
<P>Nor will all the Hi&s;tory which I &s;hall Trace in the pur&s;uit of this Affair, Illu&s;trate it more than the very Story of <HI>the &V;nion it &s;elf;</HI> The &s;trange Oppo&s;ition made to the Treaty, and to the Parliament in <HI>Scotland,</HI> again&s;t all manner of Rea&s;oning, again&s;t Nature, again&s;t Intere&s;t, the Aver&s;ion to it among tho&s;e very People that are now made Happy by it, with what Convul&s;ions this evil Spirit was ca&s;t out, what Struggles it made at parting, how the poor En&s;laved People fought again&s;t their approaching Freedom, In&s;ulted the Pa|triots of their Liberty, and with inexpre&s;&s;ible Unea&s;ine&s;s, received
<PB N="3" REF="36">
the Ble&s;&s;ing of Univer&s;al Peace. The&s;e things, I &s;ay, will be la&s;ting Te&s;timonies to that Original Aver&s;ion that was planted in the Minds of the People, notwith&s;tanding the Nearne&s;s of their Cir|cum&s;tances in other Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not go back to the Wars here, between the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Picts,</HI> and the <HI>Britains,</HI> in the Time of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and how afterwards in the declining of their Empire, the <HI>Britains fatally to them,</HI> called in the <HI>Saxons</HI> to &s;upport them again&s;t the Fury of the <HI>Scots;</HI> The Famous <HI>Picts</HI> Wall built in the Time of the <HI>Romans,</HI> the Remains whereof are vi&s;ible to this day, are &s;ad Tokens of the Ancient Quarrels, Wars, and Deva&s;tations that were carried on between the two Kingdoms, even beyond our Accounts of Time.</P>
<P>Nor does it appear to me, That there was in all tho&s;e Times, any Propen&s;ity between the Nations to &s;uch a thing as Peace, no not for many Ages after tho&s;e Times, but if either Side found it convenient to Treat, even tho&s;e Treaties were carried on with a kind of a profe&s;&s;ed Re&s;olution of renew'd War on the fir&s;t occa&s;ion; and I think Hi&s;tory gives us no Account of any firm re&s;olv'd Peace ever made among them, but only &s;hort Truces of Peace for a Term of Years, very often for One year, Two or Three, at the end of which, the War was &s;uppo&s;ed to break out again of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Nor were the&s;e Wars carried on like the Wars between other Nations, with Policy, Temper, and Points of Honour, but all that could be expected, when two Terrible and War-like Nations, pro|voked to all po&s;&s;ible Extreams, &s;hall meet, have been to be found here&mdash;; The&s;e unhappy Wars have therefore been all Deva&s;ta|tion and Blood, the Inva&s;ions on either Side have always been Fire and Death, the Land laid wa&s;te with Burnings and Plunder, and then the Armies Fighting with Fury and De&s;peration, no Nations that ever Fought, <HI>&s;ince what we are told of in the old Ea&s;tern and</HI> Roman <HI>Empires,</HI> have killed &s;o many in Fight; And if I &s;hould enter into proportions of Land &amp; People, I need not make Exceptions for them either, Sixty Thou&s;and, Thirty Thou&s;and, Twenty and Fifteen Thou&s;and &s;lain of a Side, have been the frequent Numbers, of which Hi&s;tory gives Account in the Wars between the&s;e two mi&s;erable Nations, and that not &s;eldom, but very often, and &s;ome very lately.</P>
<P>I forbear to enter into a further De&s;cription of the ancient Feuds of the&s;e Nations, as what is but a Melancholly Retro&s;pect, to any that have but common Compa&s;&s;ion for their Countrey; this may &s;erve to Illu&s;trate the pre&s;ent Subject, and make the Peace we now enjoy, the more valuable to Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Entrance I &s;hall make on the Matter of Coalition &s;eems to begin with <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t King of <HI>England,</HI> and this as it was on a wrong Foot, &s;o its Continuance was accordingly&mdash;; That Victorious Monarch po&s;&s;e&s;t the whole I&s;land of <HI>Britain,</HI> for he pierced <HI>Scotland</HI> to the <HI>Orcades,</HI> and Traver&s;ed all the Mountains of <HI>Wales,</HI> &s;ubdued all the petty Princes of the <HI>Britains,</HI> and had projected to call him&s;elf King of <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="37">
But Providence had better Things in Store for this I&s;land, his projected Empire, Founded on Conque&s;t, Ended ere it began, all his Victories were Unravelled in his Effeminate Luxuriant Son, and he that had Torn the Crown from his Neighbours, had in his Po&s;terity his own Crown laid at the Foot of Ju&s;tice, and taken from the Heads of a Thoughtle&s;s young Tyrant his Son, who&s;e Life was made to pay for the Oppre&s;&s;ions of his own Subjects.</P>
<P>It was in this Kings Reign, the fir&s;t Project of Uniting the two Kingdoms was laid, and tho' it proved Abortive in its mo&s;t Early Execution, yet it is very u&s;eful to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, and to the Readers Information, to give the World a Scheme of this de&s;igned Union, and to let tho&s;e Gentlemen who have Oppo&s;ed it now as a Novelty, know, that it was the Opinion of both the Nations in all Ages, for this was in 1386, that a Union would be for the ge|neral Good of the whole&mdash;; See Engli&s;h <HI>Buchan.

<P>But the Rea&s;ons given for it, will not at all be brought in pre|judice of a Union, or Incorporation of the two Nations, for as to long Rece&s;&s;es which that Prince argued, to prove, that the <HI>Scots</HI> by Di&s;u&s;e would be rendred unfit for Arms, and &s;o be the more ea&s;ily wor&s;ted by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who by Foreign Wars were always kept Active and Vigorous, and by that means were likely to have Ad|vantages of them; that can be no Argument, the Nations now ha|ving no more occa&s;ion for that Emulation.</P>
<P>Nor does it &s;eem to me but the &s;ame principle of Care for his Na|tive Countrey, which led King <HI>Robert</HI> to be &s;o Thoughtful for Time to come, <HI>Could he have &s;een what the&s;e Ages have been brought to know,</HI> would by the &s;ame Rea&s;oning, have led him vigorou&s;ly to have pur&s;ued a Conjunction of the two Kingdoms, into one Incor|porated Body; If he had &s;een the lea&s;t Pro&s;pect of &s;uch an Attempt, being Fea&s;ible: and I believe this not from the Nature of the Thing only, and its Corre&s;pondence with his General Intere&s;t&mdash;; But from this Note, That in his Succe&s;&s;ors Times&mdash;, when the fir&s;t proper Sea&s;on &s;eemed to offer, it was not Thought of on|ly, but pur&s;ued with all po&s;&s;ible Diligence, as &s;hall appear in its proper place.</P>
<P>But to go back to the State of the Wars in his Reign, and a little before.</P>
<P>Who ever will give him&s;elf leave to Read the Hi&s;tory of the Wars at that Time, will wonder how <HI>Scotland</HI> was able to Struggle with &s;uch Terrible Lo&s;&s;es, and may reckon up above 200000 <HI>Scot&s;|men</HI> &s;lain in Fight, only again&s;t King <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, be&s;ides all the other Havock, five &s;everal Inva&s;ions of a Conquering Enemy, mu&s;t be attended with.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="38">
And yet with what Vigour they &s;hook off the Yoke, how they were to his Death, I mean King <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, preparing new Armies, and in the &s;pace of but two years after it, ventured a Battle with his Son <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;econd, at the Head of 100000 <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> at <HI>Bannockburn,</HI> and beat him out of the Field with the greate&s;t Slaughter that was ever made in <HI>Britain,</HI> &s;ince the Fight between <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror and King <HI>Harold,</HI> there being, as &s;ome Hi&s;tories &s;ay, 60000 Men &s;lain on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Side.</P>
<P>Thus ended the Union of Conque&s;t between the Nations, <HI>Scot|land</HI> recovered her Liberty, and <HI>England</HI> paid very dear for the Experiment.</P>
<P>But this is not the Rea&s;on why I begin at this Period, but as the fir&s;t Sen&s;e of the Ble&s;&s;ings of Union began to touch the People of this Age, it can not but be acknowledged the great, and in|deed the only Point of Time, to take the Ri&s;e of this Voluminous Story from.</P>
<P><HI>Alexander</HI> the Third King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> was one of the greate&s;t In&s;tances of the Vici&s;&s;itudes and precarious Condition of a Royal State in the World, in the &s;pace of about three Years, he had two Wives, and a flouri&s;hing Off-&s;pring, was left fir&s;t a Widower, then Childle&s;s, and at la&s;t Lifele&s;s, and the Crown of <HI>Scotland</HI> in a man|ner Hopele&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> the Second King of <HI>England</HI> Dying, King <HI>Alexander</HI> and his Queen takes a Journey to <HI>England,</HI> in Complement to King <HI>Edward</HI> the Fir&s;t, and to be pre&s;ent at his Coronation; I &s;hall avoid Di&s;|puting here any thing of the &s;o much controverted Article of Homage, let it be how it will, 'tis not to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, to me it &s;eems not at all the Bu&s;ine&s;s of that Journey, if it had, there had been no need of the Queens going too, nor do I Read of any Thing but a Vi&s;it of Complement, or a Journey of Curio&s;ity, to &s;ee the Pomp and Grandeur of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court, which was then very great.</P>
<P>In this Journey, Fatal to the Family as well as to <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Queen Sickned, and &s;oon after Dyed; She was followed in a few Months by both her Sons, <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Alexander,</HI> the latter being but ju&s;t Married to the Daughter of <HI>Baldwin</HI> Earl of <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>Nor was this all, Di&s;a&s;ters &s;eldom come alone, <HI>Margaret</HI> the Kings only Daughter Married to the King of <HI>Norway,</HI> Dyed the &s;ame year, leaving one Daughter only, Named al&s;o <HI>Margaret;</HI> Of whom pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>The King &s;urprized with this general Shock of Mortality upon his Family, finding him&s;elf Childle&s;s, and Unmarried, <HI>but being in his Prime of Age and Strength,</HI> Re&s;olves upon Marriage to Re&s;tore his Family, and accordingly he Marries <HI>Joletta</HI> Daughter of the Earl of <HI>Dreux</HI> in <HI>Normandy.</HI></P>
<P>But Heaven had yet further Judgments for <HI>Scotland,</HI> for before any Children were born of this Marriage, the King him&s;elf fell from his Hor&s;e, and his Kingdom, both at once, for he Broke his

<P>And here is the fir&s;t Demon&s;tration of what I &s;hall all along in|&s;i&s;t on in this Hi&s;tory, <HI>viz.</HI> That never any rational Pro&s;pect of Uniting the&s;e Kingdoms appeared in the World, but both the Na|tions unanimou&s;ly agreed, that Union was for the mutual Advan|tage of both, and that it never was Oppo&s;ed by either Nation, <HI>as a Nation,</HI> but only as Private Intere&s;t, Strength of Parties, Court Intrigues, and the Enemies of both the Nations have prevailed, to prevent their Happine&s;s.</P>

De Rerum</HI> Scoticarum <HI>Lib.</HI> 7. <HI>Fol.</HI> 71. <HI>Edward</HI> the Fir&s;t King of <HI>England,</HI> a Powerful and Politick Prince, &s;aw him&s;elf in a Con|dition to Manage <HI>Scotland</HI> by Force, as afterwards too &s;adly ap|peared, but a better Pro&s;pect at that Time being in View, he falls immediately upon a Scheme, which, if Providence had permitted it to have taken Effect, would have &s;ecured the Peace of the&s;e Kingdoms from that Time, and prevented the terrible Effu&s;ion of Blood, which happened that very &s;ame Age, as well as for many Ages &s;ince between both Kingdoms.</P>
<P>And this Project was UNION, the King had one Son <HI>Edward,</HI> Heir to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> who afterwards proved the mo&s;t Unfortunate Prince that ever Reigned in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Crown of <HI>Scotland</HI> had but one Heir, <HI>viz. Margaret</HI> of <HI>Nor|way,</HI> Grandchild to <HI>Alexander</HI> the Third, by <HI>Margaret</HI> his Daugh|ter Married to the King of <HI>Norway.</HI> It pre&s;ently Occurs to the King and his Council, That a Marriage between <HI>Edward</HI> his Son and this young Lady <HI>Margaret,</HI> then commonly called, <HI>The Maid of Nor|way,</HI> would nece&s;&s;arily Devolve both the Crowns upon his Po&s;teri|ty, and immediately E&s;tabli&s;h the Peace of both Kingdoms.</P>
<P>Nor was the Relation very Remote, for <HI>Margaret</HI> was, as above &s;aid, the Daughter of <HI>Margaret,</HI> only Daughter of King <HI>Alexander,</HI> by King <HI>Edwards</HI> own Si&s;ter; and therefore the Di&s;pen&s;ations from the Pope, were then thought nece&s;&s;ary to be obtained, as will ap|pear pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>Upon the Death of King <HI>Alexander,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Buchanan</HI> in the 8<HI>th.</HI> Book of his Hi&s;tory, <HI>a Convention of the E&s;tates was held at</HI> Scoon, <HI>to Treat about Creating a new King.</HI> The&s;e are <HI>Buchanans</HI> Words; <HI>Alexandro cum tota &s;tirpe (praeter unam ex filia Neptem) Extincto, Conventus Ordinum</HI> Sconam <HI>indicitur, in quo de novo Rege Creando &amp; &s;tatu Regni interim Componendo ageretur.</HI> Buch.

<P>I confe&s;s, con&s;idering the Character and Authority of <HI>Buchanan,</HI> I much wonder how he could &s;ay, They Met about <HI>Creating a new King,</HI> when in the &s;ame Paragraph, he &s;ays, <HI>The whole Linage of</HI> Alexander, <HI>except one Grandchild by his Daughter,</HI> being Extinct&mdash;; Now if one Grandchild was in Being, the Convention of E&s;tates could not be Met to Create a new King.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="40">
Nor does it appear that their Bu&s;ine&s;s was to Create a new King, but to Settle the Government of the Kingdom in &s;uch Hands, as might &s;ecure the publick Peace, during the Ab&s;ence of their young Queen, and till &s;he could Arrive from <HI>Norway</HI>&mdash;; And that this was their Bu&s;ine&s;s, is al&s;o evident from <HI>Buchanans</HI> own Relation, in the &s;ame Chapter Quoted above, where he &s;ays, That when mo&s;t of the Nobility were come to the &s;aid Convention, in the Fir&s;t place, they appointed Vicegerents to Govern Matters, <HI>Eo cum Fre|quens Nobilitas Veni&s;&s;et, primum Omnium Sex Creant, qui &s;ummae Re|ram praee&s;&s;ent,</HI> Buch.

<ITEM>2. That it was the be&s;t Juncture that ever had happened, or could happen for &s;uch a Coalition, and nothing but the imme|diate Hand of Providence, who re&s;erv'd it for a more happy Time, and for more happy In&s;truments to Fini&s;h, could have prevented.</ITEM>

ancient Hatred &s;eemed no way more likely to be Aboli&s;hed, than if both Nations on ju&s;t and equal Terms might be United into one.</Q></P>
<P>Here is the very &s;ub&s;tance of the Queens late Letter to the Par|liament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> about the Union now made; only here, the People unhappily &s;eem'd Blind to their own Happine&s;s, and &s;o long ago they were able to &s;ee it their mutual Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The Amba&s;&s;adors Di&s;cour&s;ed with the Nobility in the Conven|tion, about the publick Utility like to accrue to both Kingdoms.</P>
<P>What is this but mutual Stipulations, Regulations, and in &s;hort, a Treaty between them how to make a Union between the Nations, &s;uch as might be for the publick Advantage of both King|doms.</P>
<P>And this was done with General Endearments between the Kingdoms, mutual Civilities pa&s;&s;ed between the Gentlemen con|cerned on both Sides, for the Good of both; we read of no Jea|lou&s;ies, no Prejudices, no radicated Antipathies, but the publick Good convinced both Sides, that nothing could Contribute more to the Rooting out and Aboli&s;hing the ancient Hatred, than to have both Nations on ju&s;t and equal Terms be UNITED INTO ONE.</P>
<P>Nor is it remote to this purpo&s;e, to enter a little into the Ar|ticles of this Union, for tho' Hi&s;tory is very &s;ilent in this Matter, yet, as I have promi&s;ed to &s;earch every Thing in this Hi&s;tory to the Bottom, I find among the Records in the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> an Ancient In&s;trument or Form of this Union or Confederacy, which in the <HI>Appendix</HI> to this Work, you will have Printed at large, and is Numbred 1.</P>
<P>And <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> to let the World be &s;atisfied, that even in &s;o remote a Time, things of this nature were Tran&s;acted with the &s;ame due Caution and Regard to the Liberties and Good of the People, as they are now, and that it was a National not a private Act, not an Act of a few, Over-awed by the Power of King <HI>Edward,</HI> tho' &s;eve|ral Steps taken in it, will be very nece&s;&s;ary to be Noted, for I take this to be the mo&s;t exact Pattern of the pre&s;ent Treaty, of any that has ever gone before it, as it was a Treaty &s;eriou&s;ly &s;et about by both Nations, with a real De&s;ign for the general Utility, and with a De&s;ign on both Sides to bring it to pa&s;s, which is more than can be &s;aid of all the Treaties which have been &s;et on Foot &s;ince.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Step the King took after his &s;ending Amba&s;&s;adors to Treat with the Convention, &s;eems to me to be the obtaining a Di&s;pen&s;ation from the Pope; the Queen and the young Prince being nearly Allyed; and &s;uch was the &s;ubjection of the Princes of the World to the <HI>Roman</HI> Tyranny, that nothing could go on of this Nature, without the Sanction of the Church, where, by the way may be ob&s;erved;</P>
<P>That the Pope, as in all Ages Popes have done, made his Ad|vantage of the Occa&s;ion, and takes this Opportunity, to Demand of the King an old Arrear of an annual Pen&s;ion of 1000 Merks,
<PB N="9" REF="42">
Granted by King <HI>John</HI> to the Holy See, and which King <HI>Edward</HI> had le&s;t five years unpaid.</P>
<P>The King, who knew well enough the Influence ready Money had in &s;uch Ca&s;es, readily an&s;wers the Popes Demands, and I&s;&s;ued his Writ for payment of the Money.</P>
<P>The true Copy of the Original Warrant to the Trea&s;urer, is added in the <HI>Appendix</HI> to this Work, which being very &s;hort, I thought not Improper to in&s;ert there, as a Thing the Curious may be very well plea&s;ed to Read, and is marked N^o^. (8.)</P>
<P>It is to be Noted the End of King <HI>Edward</HI> in payment of this Money, was plainly to get the Di&s;pen&s;ation Expedited, for he never paid any more that I read of, nor his Succe&s;&s;ors either, I mean, on account of that old Pen&s;ion or Grant of King <HI>John's.</HI></P>
<P>His Holine&s;s was &s;o exceedingly obliged by this payment of 5000 Merks, that he immediately di&s;patched the Di&s;pen&s;ation for the Marriage of Prince <HI>Edward,</HI> with the Heire&s;s of the Crown of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> tho' within the prohibited Degrees of Con&s;anguinity; which Di&s;pen&s;ation is Enrolled in the patent Roll of 17. <HI>Ed.</HI> 1&s;t. and may be found in the <HI>Appendix</HI> to this Work, N^o 2.</P>
<P>The next Step the King takes is, to &s;end Amba&s;&s;adors and Letters to the King of <HI>Norway,</HI> giving his Proxie to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Durham,</HI> one of the &s;aid Amba&s;&s;adors, to E&s;pou&s;e the Lady in the Name of his Son <HI>Edward,</HI> wherein the Di&s;pen&s;ation obtained from the Pope, is Repeated; This Letter and Proxie is added in the <HI>Appendix,</HI> N^o^. 3.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame Time he &s;ends Letters to the Keepers or Guardians of the Realm of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to the King of <HI>Norway</HI> in An&s;wer to Letters received from them, containing all the Articles and Agree|ments on which it was that he propo&s;ed this Marriage, which were Publi&s;hed by the King, for the Satisfaction of the Subjects of both Nations, in which you will find all po&s;&s;ible Care taken of the Ge|neral Good, and &s;incere Prote&s;tations, that the End of this Mar|riage, was, as is expre&s;&s;ed in one of the Letters, <HI>Ad Honorem Dei &amp; Tranquilitatem Totius Communitatis eju&s;dem Regni.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Te&s;timonials are too &s;ignificant not to de&s;erve a Place in this Hi&s;tory, and therefore are placed in their Order in the Col|lection, and Numbred 4, 5, 6, 7.</P>
<P>Nor was this all, but I find a large Charter or Grant made by the Agreement of &s;pecial Commi&s;&s;ioners on both Sides, and Rati|fied by the King him&s;elf, to the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;hort, it is a meer Treaty of Union between the Kingdoms, tho' not much Collateral, but rather particularly to <HI>Scotland,</HI> this has the Great Seal affixed to it, and the King took an Oath to ob|&s;erve it, under the Penalty of One Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds <HI>Sterling, an immen&s;e Sum in tho&s;e days,</HI> to be paid to the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> towards carrying on the Wars in the Holy Land, and on the farther Penalty of Excommunication, and &s;ubjecting his whole Kingdom to an Interdict; Things very Terrible in tho&s;e Days.</P>

<P>I cannot omit to Re-mind the Reader of the&s;e Sheets, what were the Di&s;mal Con&s;equences of this Di&s;appointment to both the&s;e Kingdoms, and as it was nothing but the immediate Hand of Pro|vidence that brought it to pa&s;s, &s;o it may, without any Charge of <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> or Over-&s;training the Ca&s;e, be allowed, to be one of the &s;evere&s;t Judgments that ever Heaven Inflicted on this I&s;land.</P>
<P>And I in&s;i&s;t on this, not &s;o much as it relates to the pre&s;ent Hi&s;tory, but as it may be needful for &s;uch People to Reflect upon, who have, <HI>at the &s;ame Time that they pretended to be Lovers of their Coun|trey,</HI> yet vigorou&s;ly Oppo&s;ed the Uniting the&s;e Nations in this la&s;t Treaty.</P>
<P>The breaking of the happy Pro&s;pect of Union between the two Kingdoms, was attended with &s;trange Confu&s;ions, all which &s;erve to Enhance the Value of their pre&s;ent United State, the hopes of a pro&s;perous Peace were not greater on one Hand, than the pro&s;pect of Di&s;mal Confu&s;ions was Horrid on the other; And tho' it be a Digre&s;&s;ion, I &s;hall venture the Tre&s;pa&s;s to give a &s;hort Abridgement of the Hi&s;tory of tho&s;e Times, as in the Cour&s;e of the&s;e Sheets it &s;hall be needful to Form a due Connexion, and I promi&s;e my &s;elf, the Diver&s;ion will be as plea&s;ant as profitable, and that no body will think it lo&s;t Labour to Read over, what in tho&s;e Ages was Tran&s;acted on the Stage of their Native Countrey.</P>
<P>With the Death of this Prince&s;s, all the Thoughts of Union be|tween the Kingdoms Dyed al&s;o, each Party began to Examine their &s;eparate Intere&s;ts, not Con&s;ulting what was fit to be done for the carrying on their National and General Advantages.</P>
<P>The Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Scotland</HI> was, how to Settle the Crown, and who to Declare King, the Con&s;ervators or Keepers of the Kingdom, ap|pointed
<PB N="11" REF="44">
by the Convention of the E&s;tates A&s;&s;embled at <HI>Scoon,</HI> were according to <HI>Buchanan, Duncan Macduff</HI> Earl of <HI>Fife, John Cumin</HI> Earl of <HI>Buchan, William Frazer</HI> Arch-bi&s;hop of St. <HI>Andrews, Robert</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> another <HI>John Cumin,</HI> and one <HI>John Steuart.</HI></P>
<P>The principal Pretenders to the Crown, were, <HI>John Baliol</HI> and <HI>Robert Bruce,</HI> their De&s;cent, and the Foundation of their Claim, is at large to be found in <HI>Buchanans</HI> Hi&s;tory <HI>Lib.</HI> 8. their Titles were remote, and not only pretty equally founded, but their Intere&s;t among the Nobility was &s;o equal, and either way &s;o powerful, that nothing but an immediate and Bloody War was apprehended, as the Con&s;equence of their Preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>England</HI> di&s;appointed in his Hopes of bringing the Kingdoms to a la&s;ting Peace, by Uniting them into one, as before, applyed him&s;elf no more to Con&s;ult their General Good.</P>
<P>But con&s;idering them in their &s;eparate Capacity, as two Nations that could not long Agree, made it his whole Study, either fir&s;t to &s;ubject <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> &s;o as that making her Dependent on <HI>England,</HI> &s;he &s;hould not be able to Break with him; or &s;o to di|vide the <HI>Scots</HI> among them&s;elves, as that they &s;hould be in no Con|dition to Hurt him.</P>
<P>Both his Ends &s;eemed ea&s;ie to An&s;wer in the Occa&s;ion that now offered it &s;elf; for the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility being, <HI>as I have Noted,</HI> &s;o equally divided in the Intere&s;ts of <HI>Baliol</HI> and <HI>Bruce,</HI> that they knew not what Cour&s;e to take, they re&s;olved, in order to avoid the Confu&s;ions of a War, and con&s;equently the Ruin of their Countrey, to refer it to the Arbitriment of the King of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>This was a full Te&s;timony of the Harmony and good Under|&s;tanding which was then between the Nations, and what a happy Juncture it had been for a Union, if Heaven had thought fit to ble&s;s the De&s;ign with Succe&s;s, any body may ob&s;erve; for the King of <HI>England</HI> was looked upon as &s;uch a Di&s;intere&s;ted Friend to <HI>Scot|land,</HI> and one that would willingly concern him&s;elf for their Good, that they leave the Determination of the weightie&s;t Thing in the World, <HI>to their Nation,</HI> wholly to his Sentence.</P>
<P>But I can not &s;ay the King Acted with equal Candor to the <HI>Scots,</HI> if what the Hi&s;tories of tho&s;e Times &s;ay, may be depended upon; For being a politick Prince, and having a long View of the Effects of Things before him, he re&s;olved to keep his Eye upon the two Particulars Noted above, in his Determining this Affair, and rather to regard his own Intere&s;t than the Good of <HI>Scotland,</HI> or than the Ju&s;tice of the Claim; he re&s;olved to Sound the Inclinations of the two Canditates for the Crown, and &s;o to give the Kingdom to him, that would conform him&s;elf mo&s;t to his Mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Upon this he Treats fir&s;t with the Nobility, and appoints a Meet|ing at <HI>Berwick,</HI> then he Exacts an Oath of the Competitors, to &s;tand intirely to and be Determined by his Award; Then he orders a Select Number out of the Nobility of each Nation, as a Council in this Ca&s;e, Twelve of a Side, Mr. <HI>Tyrrel</HI> &s;ays, Fourty of a Side, and
<PB N="12" REF="45">
Exacts an Oath of them, to Advi&s;e, Judge, and Determine Rightly and Truly according to their Con&s;ciences.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the Politick Appearances of his Management, the better to cover his true De&s;ign; for all this while he cau&s;es the two Competitors to be Sounded Under-hand, to find out which was mo&s;t likely to Comply with his Demands.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, the publick Debates beginning to draw near a Period, it was ea&s;ie to &s;ee, That <HI>Baliols</HI> Title was like to be Approved by the Twenty Four, as the be&s;t Claim, and that <HI>Bruce</HI> would lo&s;e it, this the King thought, was the Juncture to put it home in, and there|fore cau&s;es it to be propo&s;ed to <HI>Bruce,</HI> That tho' it was plain he would lo&s;e the Crown, yet if he would &s;ubject him&s;elf and the Crown, to the Authority of the King of <HI>England,</HI> he &s;hould be im|mediately Declared.</P>
<P>All Men mu&s;t Allow it was Politickly Managed, <HI>but all the Craft of Hell is lo&s;t upon an hone&s;t Man, Bruce</HI> like a Man of Honour, Re|jects the Propo&s;al with Contempt, and told them that propo&s;ed it, That <HI>he &s;corned to enjoy the Crown at the Price of his Countries Bondage.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Baliol,</HI> who&s;e Principle was wor&s;e, tho' his Title was better, Ac|cepts the ba&s;e Conditions, and obtains the Crown, Swears Fealty to the King of <HI>Kngland,</HI> and makes all the Nobility that were in his Intere&s;t, do the &s;ame.</P>
<P>All our Hi&s;torians do not agree in this Account, and Mr. <HI>Tyrrel,</HI> who is very particular in relating the Proceedings, <HI>Vol.</HI> 3. <HI>Lib.</HI> 9. <HI>Fol.</HI> 70, 71, 72. takes no Notice of this, but others, and parti|cularly <HI>Buchanan</HI> being very po&s;itive, <HI>Lib.</HI> 8. <HI>Fol.</HI> 24. I put it down as Fact, giving my Authors Authority for it, and leave the Reader to believe as much as he thinks fit of the Fact, the Subject I am upon, not depending upon it at all.</P>
<P>But he that ba&s;ely yields to a Di&s;hone&s;t Yoke, in order to Gratifie his Ambition, is much more likely to break the Conditions he makes, than he that adheres to Honourable Articles, and in&s;i&s;ts on what Ju&s;tice gives him a Claim to, and thus it was here, for on the fir&s;t Affront offered to <HI>Baliol</HI> by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> in con&s;equence of his Subjection, he threw off the Yoke, and Renounced that Subjection; The Ca&s;e in &s;hort was as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Macduff</HI> Earl of <HI>Fife</HI> being Injured, as he conceives, in a Suit Depending between him and the <HI>Abernethians,</HI> for the Murder of his elder Brother, <HI>The King having Determined in Favour of the Murde|rers,</HI> Appeals to the King of <HI>England</HI> again&s;t <HI>Baliol</HI>&mdash;; When the Cau&s;e came to be heard, <HI>John Baliol</HI> was then at the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court, and being pre&s;ent when he was Called to An&s;wer, offers to Plead by a Proxy, <HI>or as we &s;ay,</HI> to be heard by his Council, but was refu&s;ed, and obliged to come down, and &s;tand at the Bar like a Criminal, and plead for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>This broke off all his Subjection, fills him with Indignation; and from this Time, he Studies nothing but Revenge; an Opportunity &s;oon offered to his Mind, for a War breaking out between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="46">
and the <HI>French,</HI> and both Soliciting <HI>Scotland</HI> for Aid, the E&s;tates of <HI>Scotland</HI> Determine, <HI>Tho' in an ill Hour for Scotland,</HI> to A&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>Thus all the good Temper of both Nations one towards another Vani&s;hed at once, and the mo&s;t Bloody Wars that ever this I&s;land felt, happened between them.</P>
<P><HI>Baliol</HI> by a &s;olemn Emba&s;&s;y, Renounces his Submi&s;&s;ion to <HI>Eng|land,</HI> as Extorted by unju&s;t Methods, and his Friend&s;hip al&s;o&mdash;; And <HI>Edward</HI> in Return, furiou&s;ly Invades <HI>Scotland</HI> both by Sea and Land.</P>
<P>'Tis not at all my De&s;ign, nor to my Purpo&s;e, to enter here in|to the Hi&s;tory of the&s;e Wars, or the Battels, Ravages, Fire and Blood, which the two Nations felt during the whole Reign of the three <HI>Edwards</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> with but &s;mall Intermi&s;&s;ions; the par|ticulars whereof would of them&s;elves make a large Volume&mdash;; The true Rea&s;on of my mentioning the&s;e Things, will appear in my further pro&s;ecuting this Story: The &s;hort U&s;e of it is this, That the&s;e two unhappy Nations were always in Extremes with one another; Nothing but the <HI>clo&s;est &V;nion,</HI> or the mo&s;t de&s;tructive <HI>War,</HI> can be the State they mu&s;t live in together; And this I &s;hall but too often make evident in the&s;e Sheets.</P>
<P>From this Breach, the War between the Nations came to a &s;trange height, <HI>Edward</HI> proved Victorious over the <HI>Scots,</HI> and the Con&s;e|quences of that are ea&s;ie to Gue&s;s, <HI>Baliol</HI> was Cru&s;ht, his Armies Overthrown, the Countrey Pierc't, even to the Extreme&s;t part by the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Edward</HI> calls <HI>Bruce</HI> to his Side, <HI>Baliol</HI> is taken Pri&s;oner and Sur|renders the Kingdom, then the Famous <HI>Wallace</HI> gets up, and carries on the War on the Subject of meer National Liberty, Overthrows the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in &s;everal Encounters, and is made Regent: But is again Overthrown by <HI>Edward</HI> and <HI>Bruce</HI> at the great Battel of <HI>Falkirk,</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> then intirely &s;ubmits to <HI>Edward,</HI> who&s;e Tyrannical Government makes the very <HI>Scots</HI> who had taken part with him again&s;t <HI>Baliol,</HI> Con&s;pire together to Recover their Liberty, and one <HI>Cuming</HI> Leaguing with <HI>Robert Bruce,</HI> Son to that <HI>Bruce</HI> who was to have been King; The&s;e, tho' Enemies before, joyn together to free their Countrey. But <HI>Cuming</HI> de&s;igning to Betray <HI>Bruce,</HI> is Killed by him with his own Hands in the very Church at <HI>Drum|fries.</HI></P>
<P>How <HI>Bruce</HI> after this Recovered the Kingdom from that Subjecti|on to the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> How he was often Overthrown by <HI>Edward,</HI> and &s;everal times reduced to hide him&s;elf in the Mountains, and mo&s;t &s;ecret Places of the Kingdom, and &s;ometimes &s;o long, that he was &s;uppo&s;ed to be Dead;&mdash;How yet at la&s;t by innumerable Attempts, Unwearied Pains, and Invincible Courage he retrived his Fortune, Drove the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> out of his Countrey, Overthrew them with a terrible Slaughter at <HI>Bannockburn</HI> near <HI>Stirling,</HI> and after a Reign of Twenty Four Years full of continual War, again&s;t the mo&s;t power|ful Princes <HI>England</HI> had in the&s;e Ages of the World; he Died in
<PB N="14" REF="47">
Peace, his Countrey being Recovered out of their Hands; The&s;e Things would be too long a Story here to relate.</P>
<P>In this War, by the be&s;t Calculations I can make, of Armies Rai&s;ed, and Battels Fought, no le&s;s than Six Hundered Thou&s;and People of both Nations peri&s;hed, and all for want of that happy UNION, &s;o near perfected, and &s;o di&s;a&s;truou&s;ly lo&s;t. A good Looking-gla&s;s for tho&s;e Gentlemen <HI>(who have openly wi&s;hed the&s;e Nations might make a Breach either on one Side or another)</HI> to look into, and for them to &s;ee, <HI>if their De&s;igns had</HI> &s;ucceeded, what their Po&s;terity might have had cau&s;e to Thank them for.</P>
<P><HI>If it be Objected,</HI> that it does not follow, That on a Breach of this la&s;t Treaty <HI>of &V;nion,</HI> a War mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have happened, I &s;hall take the Liberty to enter upon that Head by it &s;elf, and believe the&s;e Sheets will prove, That a War mu&s;t have been the inevitable Con&s;equence of breaking up this la&s;t Treaty, e&s;pecially if broken up according to the Project of tho&s;e People that appeared to Op|po&s;e it, who, we all know, acted on Principles, both as to Trade, Civil Government, and Succe&s;&s;ion, Incompatible with the Intere&s;t of both the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hments, and as much as can be &s;aid perfectly impracticable, as the Kingdoms were thus Con&s;tituted; But of this more hereafter.</P>
<P>From this Time, we meet with no Overtures of &s;ettled Tran|quillity between the Kingdoms, till the Days of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. of <HI>England,</HI> who&s;e Daughter <HI>Margaret</HI> was Married to <HI>James</HI> IV. King of <HI>Scotland</HI>&mdash;; And tho' this Marriage was the Mother of Uni|on (as I may Term it) and laid the Foundation of almo&s;t all the Projects that have happened &s;ince, and from whence at la&s;t the Crown of <HI>England</HI> Devolved upon the Royal Line of <HI>Scotland,</HI> yet in his Time there were no immediate Steps taken towards it. The outmo&s;t Effect of this Marriage, was an immediate Peace between the Nations, which, however, did not la&s;t long, but King <HI>James</HI> falling in with the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t, fell out with his Father-in-law King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. and after with his Brother King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and lo&s;t his Life in that War.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Attempt &s;ub&s;equent to this, was a Propo&s;al of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. who, after this great Quarrel was ended, tho' he was Victor, offered <HI>to Match his Daughter</HI> Mary <HI>(Prince</HI> Edward, <HI>afterwards King</HI> Edward VI. <HI>being then not Born)</HI> to <HI>James</HI> the 5<HI>th.</HI> King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to &s;ecure the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Crown after him&s;elf to them Joyntly; And the de&s;ign of this Match, <HI>it was evident,</HI> could be nothing el&s;e, but a firm, la&s;ting, and e&s;tabli&s;hed Peace between the two Nations; For having him&s;elf no Sons, and expecting none, <HI>(For the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Divorce of his Wife Queen</HI> Katharine <HI>was not then come into his Head)</HI> He fore&s;aw this was the only Step to Unite the Nations, and put an End to the&s;e Bloody Contentions, that for &s;o many Ages had been between them, for that the Heirs of that Match would by con&s;equence be po&s;&s;e&s;t of both, and &s;o the whole I&s;land would become one Happy and mo&s;t powerful People, United in Intere&s;t, in Government, and in every Thing that would make them Great.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="48">
This Propo&s;al was &s;o Rational, and &s;o vi&s;ibly tending to the general Advantage of both Kingdoms, That it could not be &s;up|po&s;ed to meet with any Oppo&s;ition from &s;uch, as were in the lea&s;t concerned for the Good of their Native Country on either Hand.</P>
<P><HI>On the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Side</HI> it met with an immediate good Reception, for King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII, contrary to the general Conduct of that Prince, who&s;e Temper was (generally &s;peaking) Bloody, Fierce, Haugh|ty, and too apt to In&s;ult &s;uch as fell into his Hands; Yet here, changing his Temper, he cau&s;ed the <HI>Scots</HI> Pri&s;oners, taken at the late Battel, to be very well Treated, and Committed to the &s;everal Keepings of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nobility, who u&s;ed them Honourably, and according to their Quality.</P>
<P>I know it is &s;aid, That the King, who had this Project fir&s;t in his Head, di&s;tributed the <HI>Scots</HI> Noblemen in the Hou&s;es of the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Lords, That the&s;e might, according to his private In&s;tructions, deal with them apart, and &s;trive, by Promi&s;es, and &s;uch like Ar|guments, to bring them to hearken to &s;uch a Propo&s;al, and to be|gin the Treaty&mdash;; And that the &s;aid <HI>Scots</HI> Noblemen were, by this Artifice, prompted, and brought to make the fir&s;t Offer of this Marriage, as from <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>But let this be as it will, let the Honour of the Propo&s;al ly where it will, it is manife&s;t, both Parties were well plea&s;ed with it, and look'd upon it as the be&s;t Method, to bring both Nations to a State of Pro&s;perous and Durable Peace. But <HI>Satan hindered.</HI></P>
<P>It was evident, That both Kingdoms had a fixed Inclination, at this time, for the Union: <HI>Henry</HI> &s;hewed his Good Will, in that he offered to heap up unu&s;ual Honours upon the King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> upon the fir&s;t Project of the Match, as upon his undoubted Succe&s;&s;or to the Crown, &s;uch as making him a Peer of <HI>Britain,</HI> by the Royal Title of Duke of <HI>York,</HI> a Title Ve&s;ted in the Crown, and &s;ince the Father of <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth, reckoned the next Step to the Throne; But this was not all, he offered to declare him Lord Lieutenant, or Deputy Governour of <HI>England,</HI> immediately upon the Match; This was to put the Government, as it were, in his actual Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and make him King by the Con&s;equence of the Thing&mdash;; There is no doubt, but, had this Match &s;ucceeded, there would have been mutual Stipulations of a compleat Coalition entred into by the re&s;pective Parliaments of both Kingdoms.</P>
<P>But <HI>French</HI> and Popi&s;h Coun&s;els prevented this Happy Conjuncti|on, as they have &s;everal others &s;ince, <HI>and would have done the la&s;t;</HI> For the Clergy of <HI>Scotland</HI> finding <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. of <HI>England</HI> had cru&s;ht the Power of the Clergy in <HI>England,</HI> and was &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the Abbeys and Mona&s;teries, curbing the extended Authority of the Pope, and as they apprehended de&s;troying their Church, they &s;et them&s;elves by all po&s;&s;ible Artifice, to prevent this Propo&s;als taking Effect; And getting the <HI>French</HI> King to joyn his Intere&s;t with theirs, they wrought the King of <HI>Scotland</HI> to &s;uch a Di&s;like of the Match, That he rejected King <HI>Henry</HI>'s Propo&s;al with &s;ome Indecencies, re|fu&s;ed him an Interview at <HI>York,</HI> tho' he had given his Word to
<PB N="16" REF="49">
meet him there&mdash;; This King <HI>Henry</HI> &s;o re&s;ented, That a War immediately followed, (as upon a Defeat of an Union has gene|rally happened) in which War, the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility were &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the wrong Mea&s;ures of their Prince, and the Advantages to their Country, which he had ra&s;hly rejected, That they followed him very unwillingly, and at la&s;t wholly abandoned him at <HI>Solan-Mo&s;s,</HI> Declaring, They thought it was not their Duty to ruine their Country, to gratifie the Pa&s;&s;ion of their Deluded Monarch, and the Blinded Fury of the Clergy: This co&s;t King <HI>James</HI> his Life, who died of Grief, as <HI>Buchanan</HI> relates, <HI>Rerum Scoticarum, Lib.</HI> 7. <HI>Fol.</HI> 76.</P>
<P>Its true, had this Match gone forward, it had not had the de|&s;igned Effect, at lea&s;t not immediately, becau&s;e King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII. afterwards had a Son born, who &s;ucceeded to the Crown <HI>(viz.) Edward</HI> the VI&mdash;; But this is not to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, the De&s;ign was the &s;ame, nor did it die with the re&s;pective Kings&mdash;; Nay, after the Birth of the Young Prince, King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII. made a &s;econd Propo&s;al of an Union, <HI>viz.</HI> Of a Match between his Son <HI>Edward,</HI> and the Daughter of the late King of <HI>Scots;</HI> And this went &s;o far, as to be Approved in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as may be &s;een in the Regi&s;ters of that Time; But this was again interrupted, as the former had been, by the Death of King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII. who left the Crown to his Son <HI>Edward</HI> the VI.</P>
<P>In this Reign, the Project of Uniting the Kingdoms revived im|mediately, for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Council &s;aw clearly the Advantages ac|cruing to both Nations by an Union, and could not &s;lip that Happy Juncture: Their King was a Child not above Nine Years of Age, the Queen of <HI>Scotland</HI> was the like, left by her Father at Five Days old, and Crowned in her Cradle: The Regency of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Council of Governours of the Young King, revive the Treaty, and propo&s;e a Match between the King of <HI>England</HI> and the Queen of <HI>Scotland</HI>&mdash;, and built it upon the late Agreement made be|tween King <HI>Henry</HI> and the Parliament of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>French</HI> and Popi&s;h Party, who, as I have noted already, oppo&s;ed Uniting the Kingdoms before, on the pretence of the Dan|ger of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, had now much more Rea&s;on to do &s;o; Since King <HI>Edward</HI> had declared him&s;elf, <HI>as they e&s;teemed it,</HI> an Heretick, had di&s;owned the Pope, and had erected a Prote&s;tant Church on the Ruine of the <HI>Romi&s;h;</HI> And on the&s;e Arguments they rejected the Propo&s;al, and broke their former Agreement.</P>
<P>And here happened, <HI>what I have all along ob&s;erved to be the Con&s;e|quence of breaking up a Treaty between the Two Nations, viz.</HI> A Bloody War, like as certainly mu&s;t have happened again, had not this la&s;t Happy Treaty interveened, of which I am to Di&s;cour&s;e, in the&s;e Sheets.</P>
<P>It is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s to enter upon the Particulars of the War on this Occa&s;ion, but two Things it will be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> That this War i&s;&s;ued in the Defeat of the <HI>Scots</HI> Popi&s;h Army at the Battel at <HI>Pinkie,</HI> after which it was expected the Young Queen &s;hould have been delivered to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and Marryed to their King:
<PB N="17" REF="50">
And truly, if the Frank and Generous Offer of the Conquerors had been in the lea&s;t regarded, it had been &s;o, who, after the Victory made no Spoil or Havock in <HI>Scotland,</HI> but, as Friends, made a Fair De|mand of their <HI>(the Scots)</HI> Queen to be Married to their <HI>(the Engli&s;h)</HI> King, That &s;o the Nations being United, might for ever remain One&mdash;; And this is to be &s;een in that Famous Declaration of the Duke of <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> General, which, as it is in a Stile peculiar, and not u&s;ual in the World among Conquerors, I could not omit, and is in the <HI>Appendix, N^o.</HI> 11.</P>

It was in Vain to Talk Rea&s;on to a People re&s;olved; The Popi&s;h Party, who &s;aw evidently the Ruine of their Church, and the <HI>French,</HI> who &s;aw the De&s;truction of their Ancient League wrapt up in the projected Union of the Kingdoms, fru&s;trated all the De&s;ign, by Conveying the Young Prince&s;s into <HI>France;</HI> And &s;o this Scheme came al&s;o to nothing.</P>
<P>This had &s;everal bad Effects, which <HI>Scotland</HI> afterwards Regret|ed, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That it delayed the Reformation in <HI>Scotland</HI> for near Thirty Years after that in <HI>England,</HI> and made it both Difficult, Bloody, Tedious, and for a long Time Imperfect, of which I have Treated el&s;ewhere. <HI>Secondly,</HI> It brought her under a <HI>French</HI> Yoke, and for a long Time &s;he Groaned under the Tyranny of <HI>French</HI> In|fluence, till the Nation threw off Tyranny and Popery together, and Reformation came on Hand in Hand with Liberty.</P>
<P>And now the Notion of Union between the Two Kingdoms be|gan to wear out, as a Thing, That, <HI>tho' both Nations had Inclinati|on enough to engage in,</HI> yet there was no Juncture to make it Fea&s;ible, till the Death of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who dying without I&s;&s;ue, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Crown devolved upon the <HI>Scots</HI> Line; And this produced <HI>a kind of &V;nion,</HI> I mean an Union of the Crowns, but not an Uni|on of the Kingdoms; Of the Imperfection, Deficiency and Incon|veniency of which to both Kingdoms, I &s;hall make &s;ome brief Ob&s;ervations, as they have been the Motives to the frequent At|tempts for a more near Conjunction in the &s;ucceeding Times.</P>
<P>The Inconveniencies to <HI>Scotland</HI> in this partial Union were, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Their removing their Court to <HI>England,</HI> their King, accord|ing to the Prophetick Saying of <HI>Henry</HI> the VII, removing his Seat of Government from the le&s;s to the greater&mdash;; This was natu|rally attended with the Decay of Trade in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by removing the Concour&s;e of Strangers from <HI>Scotland,</HI> who&s;e Con&s;umption of Provi&s;ions and Manufactures, which are the Foundation of Com|merce, was a great Lo&s;s to Trade&mdash;; With the Exporting their ready Money out of the Kingdom, by the con&s;tant Attendance of their Gentry and Nobility at the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court, where they &s;pent their E&s;tates, and &s;uck'd out the Blood of their Country, to &s;upport their Luxury and Magnificence&mdash;; With the continued empty|ing their Nation of their People, who all flocked to <HI>England,</HI> ei|ther for publick or private Employment, and Depopulated, as well as Impoveri&s;hed, their Native Country; <HI>But above all,</HI> the bringing <HI>Scotland</HI> under <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Influence, both as to Civil and Religious
<PB N="18" REF="51">
Government, was a manife&s;t Token of the Deficiency of this partial Union; For <HI>Scotland</HI> was after this, in a Political Sen&s;e, tho' not in a Legal Sen&s;e, always under the Management of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court: It had the Subjection without the Advantages&mdash;; Her Sea|men were pre&s;s'd into the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Service as Subjects, yet, at the &s;ame time, excluded the Merchants Service as Foreigners, an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship Sailed with above one Third <HI>Scots</HI> Men would be &s;eized, as not being Sailed by <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, and the Colonies of <HI>England</HI> were at la&s;t all barred from them, as much as from the <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Dutch;</HI> It would be too long a Digre&s;&s;ion, to recite here the various Incon|veniencies <HI>Scotland</HI> laboured under, from the Deficiency of this partial, or meerly Regal Union, and which made all the Well-Wi&s;hers to <HI>Scotland</HI> de&s;ire, either that there were a more intire Union, or that there were no Union at all&mdash;</P>
<P>Nor was this unfore&s;een by either Nation, and therefore, no &s;ooner was King <HI>James</HI> the VI. of <HI>Scotland</HI> come to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> but he began (before he had learn'd quite to forget his own Country) to project a more near Union of the Nations, as the only way to make them both compleatly Happy; This was in the Year 1604&mdash;, when, <HI>after &s;everal Projects of &V;niting by his own Ab&s;olute Authority, a Thing then newly taken up in the World,</HI> finding all other Methods fail, he propo&s;ed it to the Parliament of <HI>England, That,</HI> to u&s;e his own Words, <HI>as they were made One in the Head, they might be in&s;eparably Conjoined, and all Memory of pa&s;t Di|vi&s;ions be Extingui&s;hed;</HI> At the &s;ame time he propo&s;ed it in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> and both Nations were &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the mutual Advantages of Union, That they readily agreed to it, and Commi&s;&s;ioners were appointed on both Sides to Treat.

<P>We do not find among our Authors any particular of the Debates of the&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners: <HI>Spot&s;wood</HI> in his Hi&s;tory <HI>Fol.</HI> 481. gives in a Draught of the Articles they agreed on, which for want of Room I only refer the Reader to, but having obtained from good hands, a Manu&s;cript of Sir <HI>George Mackenzies,</HI> being a little like a Journal of their Proceedings, I could not but think it very much to the purpo&s;e, to in&s;ert it in the Appendix to this Work, where may be &s;een the true Ground Plat of the pre&s;ent Union, and the Intere&s;t of both Kingdoms, clearly &s;tated&mdash;as it &s;tood then, and &s;aving in matters of Religion remains &s;till, &s;ee Appendix <HI>N</HI> 12.</P>
<P>The&s;e Articles thus mutually agreed, were Engro&s;&s;ed and Signed by the Commi&s;&s;ioners on both Sides, and pre&s;ented to the King the 6<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>December</HI> 1604&mdash;; But it was ob&s;erved. That the Earl of <HI>Sali&s;burry</HI> at the pre&s;enting the Draught to the King, expre&s;&s;ed it to be the meaning of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, That the&s;e Articles were but an imperfect Agreement, and that they were willing to fini&s;h and go through the &s;ame when ever he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>However, the King offered it to the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> and as <HI>Spot&s;wood</HI> &s;ays, Recommended it Earne&s;tly to them; But the more &s;ecret Hi&s;tory of that Affair, was, That the King him&s;elf fal|ling in at that Time with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Clergy, and Oppo&s;ing the Pro&s;|perity of his own Countrey, upon the Score of Religion and ab&s;o|lute Will, found Ways and Means to puzzle this Cau&s;e in Parliament; and <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The difficulty of the <HI>Po&s;t-Nati, a Thing, which had the</HI> Eng|li&s;h <HI>at that Time purpo&s;ed a Hearty &V;nion,</HI> would never have &s;tuck with them, occa&s;ioned long Struggle, and at la&s;t the Parliament referr'd it to the Common Law; While this was doing, the National Aver&s;ion, particularly in <HI>England,</HI> &s;eemed to revive, and the pub|lick
<PB N="20" REF="53">
Appearances in <HI>England</HI> of a Spirit of Divi&s;ion, were &s;uch, <HI>as one ob&s;erves,</HI> That very well di&s;cover'd the King was become <HI>on Engli&s;h Man,</HI> otherwi&s;e he would never have born with tho&s;e In|vectives and Railings at <HI>Scotland,</HI> which Sir <HI>Thomas Craig</HI> in his Book <HI>De &V;nione Regnorum,</HI> &s;ays, were then publickly u&s;ed in the Pulpits and in Printed Books, while their King was a <HI>Scot&s;man.</HI></P>
<P>Nor was this all, but the King in &s;tead of forwarding the Union of the two Kingdoms, or promoting the particular Advantage of <HI>Scotland,</HI> fell in with the arbitrary Projects of that Time, to make him&s;elf Ab&s;olute in <HI>Scotland</HI>&mdash;, as he was al&s;o doing in <HI>England.</HI> This would lead me into a va&s;t Ocean of National Confu&s;ions, which received their Ri&s;e and Conception in the Tyrannical Tem|per of this Prince, in which he laid the Foundation of the Ruine of his Po&s;terity, which as remote to my pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s, purpo&s;ely I Omit.</P>
<P>Asto Union, nothing further was done till the year 1660&mdash;, and till that Time, which was about 56 years, the Subjects of <HI>Scot|land</HI> enjoyed a Freedom of Commerce in Common with the <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> to all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies; But then &s;ome Acts in <HI>England</HI> pa&s;&s;ing in prejudice of that Freedom of Commerce, the <HI>Scots</HI> re|newed their Complaints, and a Commi&s;&s;ion &s;ays, Sir <HI>George Mac|kenzie</HI> was granted in the 3<HI>d.</HI> Se&s;&s;ion of the fir&s;t Parliament of <HI>Charles</HI> 2<HI>d.</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and by an Act at the &s;ame time in <HI>England,</HI> Nominating Commi&s;&s;ioners to Adju&s;t the&s;e Differences; This was in 1666.</P>
<P>The&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners met the 21<HI>&s;t. January</HI> 1667, and the <HI>Scots</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners gave in a Propo&s;al to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> for &s;ettling the Differences about Trade, which Paper I have al&s;o given you from an Original Manu&s;cript of the &s;aid Sir <HI>George Mackenzie,</HI> and which you will find in the Appendix N^o^. 13.</P>
<P>The Debates which followed this Paper, &s;ays <HI>Sir George,</HI> &s;erved only to &s;hew the King the Nece&s;&s;ity of Commencing a further Treaty, <HI>viz.</HI> Of a Union, and how Ineffectual all other Treaties would be to bring about the publick Peace of the two Nations.</P>
<P>To this End, a Parliament being called in <HI>Scotland</HI> the 19<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>October</HI> 1667, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament meeting the &s;ame Day, he cau&s;ed the great Affair of an Union to be propo&s;ed to both at the &s;ame time; The Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> by their Letter to the King, expre&s;&s;ed their Readine&s;s to concur with the Popo&s;al; And that they would grant Commi&s;&s;ion to &s;uch, as His Maje&s;ty &s;hould Nominate for that Purpo&s;e, to Treat as their Repre&s;entatives; And left it to the King to Name the Time, Place, and <HI>Quorum</HI> of their Meetings&mdash;; This being the Sub&s;tance of the Letter, I have omitted the Letter it &s;elf, which is to be &s;een in the Regi&s;ters in <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>The Parliament of <HI>England, by what Affairs ob&s;tructed I &s;hall not determine,</HI> did nothing in it that Se&s;&s;ion, but rea&s;&s;umed it in 1670, and Impowered the King by an Act 22. <HI>Carol.</HI> 2. almo&s;t in the Terms the <HI>Scots</HI> had done before.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="54">

<P>Any one that peru&s;es this &s;hort Treaty, or rather Conference, may &s;ee, That the&s;e Times were not Tempered for an Effectual Union; And tho&s;e that know any Thing of the Secret Hi&s;tory of that Day, will al&s;o know, there were private De&s;igns then on Foot, which made a nearer Union, incon&s;i&s;tent with the Views of the Court.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> in&s;i&s;ted on a Conjunction of Parliaments, not an In|corporation of Foundations, <HI>as has now been propo&s;ed; England</HI> dur&s;t never hear of &s;uch a Conjunction of Parliaments, on Account of Church Matters; Knowing, That, tho' Epi&s;copacy was then E&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> yet, that the Secret Bent of that Nation was Presbyterian; and they dur&s;t not think of a Conjunction of Hou&s;es on that Score.</P>
<P>And here I would ask leave of the Gentlemen in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who have Oppo&s;ed the pre&s;ent Union, in regard of its Hazard to the Presbyterian Church, <HI>to Re-mind them,</HI> what rea&s;on they have to look back to the Days of this Treaty, <HI>and be Thankful,</HI> That the Union was not Compa&s;&s;ed at this Time; and to con&s;ider why they &s;hould have ventured putting it off to a further Time, &s;ince, had it happned in that Time, when Epi&s;copacy had the Face of a legal E&s;tabli&s;hment in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Presbyterian Church had for ever &s;unk under its Weight, and been Exploded by the Laws of both Kingdoms; both Kingdoms had been obliged to keep it down, and it could never, <HI>Miracles excepted,</HI> have recovered it &s;elf in that Nation.</P>
<P>And thus I have Traced the &s;everal Endeavours to Unite the&s;e Kingdoms in former Times, in which I have been as Brief as I can: I &s;hall conclude this with only one Remark, which I believe will appear to be ju&s;t; Thro' the whole Cour&s;e of the &s;everal Treaties hitherto named, the fir&s;t excepted, which was di&s;appointed by a meer Judgment from Heaven, <HI>I mean the Death of the Maid of</HI> Norway; All the re&s;t of the Propo&s;als for Union between the&s;e Kingdoms, met with their particular Ob&s;tructions from Popery, <HI>French-</HI>Intere&s;t, Home-Tyranny or Court-Intrigues; The&s;e were
<PB N="31" REF="64">
the only Enemies of Union, and I believe it may, without Partia|lity be added, <HI>AND SO IT IS NOW:</HI></P>
<P>We are now come to the pre&s;ent Times, King <HI>James</HI> the II: in <HI>England,</HI> or VII. in <HI>Scotland,</HI> had no other Union in View, but that of Uniting all his Kingdoms, to the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and this put him upon Mea&s;ures perfectly di&s;tinct from all that had gone before him, from whence we have had Two Famous <HI>Revolutions</HI> in <HI>Britain,</HI> one in the Regal State of both Kingdoms, the other in the Eccle&s;ia&s;tick State of <HI>Scotland,</HI> from Epi&s;copal to Presbyterian:&mdash;This was no &s;ooner brought to pa&s;s, but <HI>Scotland</HI> put the King in mind of their De&s;ires to Unite, in their Letter to King <HI>Wil|liam;</HI> Of which pre&s;ently&mdash;. But all that Prince's Reign, this good De&s;ign met with Ob&s;tructions, of which I &s;hall be &s;ome|thing particular in its place. And thus we are brought down to Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> in who&s;e Reign this great Work was once Attempted, but proved Abortive, and at the &s;econd E&s;&s;ay was brought to Perfection, as will be &s;een in the Sequel of this Story.</P>

<P>BEFORE I enter upon the Proceedings in the Reign of Queen <HI>ANNE,</HI> towards a General Union of the&s;e Kingdoms, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the right Under&s;tanding of Things, to take a &s;hort View of the Po&s;ture of Publick Affairs in the re&s;pective Kingdoms, and what it was that rendred the Union &s;o ab&s;olutely Nece&s;&s;ary at this Time, that to all Con&s;idering People, who made any tolerable Judgment of Things, it was plain, there was no other way left, to prevent the mo&s;t Bloody War that ever had been between the two Nations.</P>
<P>At the Revolution, as has been already Noted, and &s;everal times during the Reign of the late King <HI>William,</HI> Motions had been made frequently both on the King's Side and on the Peoples al&s;o, to come to a Treaty; But that Prince had always one Thing or other ca&s;t in his Way, to prevent his good De&s;ign.</P>
<P>The King was often heard to &s;ay, That this I&s;land could never be Ea&s;ie without a Union, and if either of them under&s;tood their own Happine&s;s, they would never re&s;t till it was brought to pa&s;s. And, as I had the Honour to mention it once among other Things, in a Scheme of General Peace among the Prote&s;tant In|tere&s;ts in <HI>Europe, I can not forget,</HI> That His Maje&s;ty Expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome Concern at it, Returned, <HI>I have done all I can in that Affair, but I do not &s;ee a Temper in either Nation that looks like it</HI>&mdash;; And added, after &s;ome other Di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>It may be done, but not yet.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="66">
During the whole Reign of this Prince, the Breaches between the two Kingdoms rather Widened and Increa&s;ed, than tended to a Clo&s;e, and &s;everal National Unkindne&s;&s;es pa&s;t between them, which prepared both Sides as it were to Reflect upon, and Re|proach the other; There wanted not al&s;o a Set of wicked In&s;tru|ments always to blow the Coals of Di&s;cord between the Kingdoms into a Flame, and if po&s;&s;ible, to bring the Nations to a Rupture.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages which, I &s;ay, tended to E&s;trange the Na|tions, and as it were prepare them for a Breach, rather than for an Union, were the&s;e,<LIST>
<ITEM>The &s;ettling an <HI>African</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Company in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the &s;everal Cla&s;hings of Intere&s;t between the two Nations on that Head.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Affairs of <HI>Glenco.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The Difficulties about the Succe&s;&s;ion and Limitations.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Act of Security there.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Act in <HI>England</HI> Intituled, <HI>An Act for preventing Dangers ari&s;ing from the Act of Security in</HI> Scotland.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Seizing the Ship the <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> and Execution of Cap|tain <HI>Green,</HI> and &s;everal others&mdash;.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>All the&s;e Things concurred, to convince tho&s;e that had the lea&s;t Knowledge of Affairs in both Kingdoms, that nothing but an Uni|on could prevent the Nations falling all to pieces, as &s;oon as ever the Queen &s;hould Die, if not &s;ooner; and that therefore it was immediately and heartily to be &s;et about, as the only way to pre|&s;erve the publick Tranquillity, and prevent the certain Mi&s;chiefs that threatned the whole Body.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not enter into a particular Hi&s;tory of the&s;e &s;everal Ca&s;es, as being too tedious for this Tract, but as 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay &s;ome|thing of them, to convey the right Under&s;tanding of the&s;e Matters to Po&s;terity, and that more regularly to introduce the General Thing I am upon, <HI>viz.</HI> The Union, I cannot wholly Omit them.</P>
<P>And <HI>Fir&s;t, For the African Company,</HI> the large Commi&s;&s;ion that Company obtained, by which they &s;eem'd to Rival the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> both in their <HI>Guinea, Ea&s;t-India,</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Trade, was ill reli&s;h'd by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who at that Time were in an Odd and Un&s;ettled Po&s;ture, as to tho&s;e Trades at Home. And as this is not rightly un|der&s;tood by a great many, that run round about for Rea&s;ons of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament's falling upon that Affair, it may not be a mi&s;s to &s;et it in a clearer Light.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h East India</HI> Trade, being for a long time Pre&s;crib'd in the narrow Limits of an exclu&s;ive Company, who Tyrannized not a little in their ab&s;olute Management of that Trade, and be|came Grievous to the re&s;t of the Merchants, many Attempts were made to lay open their Stock, and Increa&s;e &s;o great, and &s;o Bene|ficial a Trade; But the Company with&s;tood all the Attempts that way, and kept all Invaders off; till at la&s;t by the mighty Advance of Two Millions to the Government, the New <HI>Ea&s;t-Indian</HI> Company got a Charter, and &s;et up again&s;t them&mdash;; How they Rival'd
<PB N="34" REF="67">
one another, and with mighty Struggles, too much Embarra&s;&s;ed the whole Nation; till the King him&s;elf was obliged to concern him&s;elf in Uniting them, and how he brought that great Work to pa&s;s, are Things not &s;o much to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e; But at this time, <HI>viz.</HI> 26 <HI>June</HI> 1695, the <HI>Scots</HI> Company obtained their Settle|ment.</P>
<P>What ever Pro&s;pects the Projectors of that Company had in their View, &s;ome of which will, <HI>I doubt,</HI> hardly bear a Hi&s;tory, I never heard one of them pretend, That either the Stock to carry it on, or the Market for their Trade, could be found in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and from hence, with other particular Objections, which I believe they never Debated, I pretend to &s;ay, They could never really pro|po&s;e any rational probability of Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>If they imagined to obtain Help from Abroad, they indeed were in the right, for they could not but know, That the Merchants in <HI>England</HI> would leap at a Propo&s;al to get into the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade, free from the Bondage of the Company mentioned before&mdash;; But if they imagined al&s;o, That this could do le&s;s than Embark the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government again&s;t them, and bring the Publick to concern them&s;elves about it, they were exceeding Short-&s;ighted, or mu&s;t at the &s;ame Time believe, the other very Ignorant in the Affairs before them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Step the Company took, was to open Books for Sub|&s;criptions at <HI>London,</HI> and afterwards at <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> and this was no &s;ooner done, but the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Company took the Alarm at both; and obtained by their Intere&s;t with the Government, In&s;tructions to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Re&s;ident at <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> to Oppo&s;e it there, which was done mo&s;t effectually. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Re&s;ident, as it was &s;aid, ta|citely Threatning the <HI>Hamburghers,</HI> That the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hould remove their Staple of Cloth to the City of <HI>Bremen,</HI> and ruine the Trade of <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> whether he did actually Threaten them &s;o or no, I do not Affirm, but 'tis certain, he &s;o managed Affairs, that the Sub&s;criptions begun there, were &s;topt, and the De&s;ign on that Side effectually ruined; Then they, <HI>I mean the</HI> Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India <HI>Com|pany,</HI> Applyed them&s;elves to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament, and by offer|ing plau&s;ible Rea&s;ons there, &s;oon obtained their Votes again&s;t it al&s;o, and again&s;t any of the Subjects of <HI>England</HI> Sub&s;cribing to it, and the <HI>Scots</HI> Merchants who had &s;ub&s;cribed in <HI>England,</HI> were or|dered to be Impeacht of a Mi&s;demeanour, tho' the Parliament being near a Clo&s;e, tho&s;e Impeachments dropt of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e things had the de&s;ired Effect, for they cru&s;hed the Attempt of rai&s;ing a <HI>New</HI> Ea&s;t-India <HI>Company</HI> in the&s;e Parts of the World, and the Projectors then played their other Game of <HI>Darien,</HI> in which they had the &s;ame Unhappine&s;s, <HI>viz.</HI> To put the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Na|tion under a Nece&s;&s;ity of Oppo&s;ing them.</P>
<P>I do readily allow, the fir&s;t Scheme of a Trade to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> had a Probability of Succe&s;s in it, a Thing I can not grant to the Affair of <HI>Darien;</HI> which, I think, had not one Branch belonging to its Contrivance, but what was Big with nece&s;&s;ary Abortions,
<PB N="35" REF="68">
&s;uch as remote Mines of Gold to be gained and maintained by Force again&s;t the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> in which <HI>England</HI> could not without Breach of Faith a&s;&s;i&s;t, &s;uch as a Trade for <HI>European</HI> Goods with the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Colonies, which mu&s;t always have been by Force or by Stealth, and neither of the&s;e had any Rational Probability.</P>
<P>As to their Trade over Land to the South Seas, and thence to the <HI>Indies,</HI> tho' much boa&s;ted of, it an&s;wers for it &s;elf, and &s;eems a too Impracticable Whim&s;y to merit any Reply, much like that other Dream of making a Navigation, or Communication between the South Seas and the Gulph of <HI>Mexico,</HI> by the River of <HI>Darien</HI>&mdash;; Which, if all were done, and the Di&s;tance mea&s;ured to that Part of <HI>India,</HI> to which we chiefly Trade, <HI>viz.</HI> The Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromondel, Surrat,</HI> Bay of <HI>Bengal, &amp;c.</HI> I think any Body will de|termine the Voyage by the <HI>Cape de Bon E&s;perance,</HI> the better Pa&s;&s;age by much, and very little if any thing longer.</P>
<P>But to come to the Ca&s;e, the Company, or rather the Projectors, who had now embark'd the Gentlemen in a Sub&s;cription of 400000 Pounds <HI>Sterling,</HI> carried on their De&s;ign, and with Two Ships.</P>
<P>Men and a Cargo perfectly unqualified for any kind of Trade, ei|ther with <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> or <HI>Spaniards,</HI> &s;et Sail, and landing at <HI>Darien,</HI> made a Settlement there, fortified them&s;elves, and prepared to maintain it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who claim a Right there, and whether that Right be di&s;puteable or no, is not the Que&s;tion here, immediately pro|ceed by a double Method, fir&s;t, To prepare to di&s;lodge them by Force, and &s;econdly, Apply them&s;elves to the King of <HI>England,</HI> claiming, <HI>by virtue of the Treaty made with</HI> England, <HI>Ratified and Exchanged,</HI> That no Succour &s;hould be given to the <HI>Scots</HI> from any of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>This, as an expre&s;s Stipulation, could not be denyed by the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Court, and accordingly a Proclamation was exhibited by the King of <HI>England,</HI> and &s;ent to all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations, forbidding Trade or Corre&s;pondence with them.</P>
<P>I cannot help &s;aying, had the Managers of the Companies Af|fairs had the lea&s;t Foreca&s;t of Things, they could not but have expected all that happened here; And al&s;o might have known, That, had they Acted right, tho&s;e Proclamations could have done them no manner of Damage.</P>
<P>Whover has the lea&s;t Knowledge of the Affairs of that Country, and of the Trade of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies, mu&s;t needs know, That, had the <HI>Scots</HI> Company, who had plac'd them&s;elves at <HI>Darien,</HI> been furni&s;h'd either with Money, or Letters of Credit, they had never wanted Provi&s;ions, or come to any other Di&s;a&s;ter, notwith&s;tand|ing the Proclamations of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> again&s;t Corre&s;pon|dence.</P>
<P>Nor will any Man be &s;o vain to &s;ay, That they ought to have ventured on &s;uch a Settlement, depending on Supplies from the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> e&s;pecially when, in their Affairs of <HI>Hamburgh</HI> and <HI>London,</HI> which were before all this, they had &s;een the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> concerning
<PB N="35" REF="69">
them&s;elves again&s;t their Company; Much le&s;s &s;hould they have gone to Plant them&s;elves in a Climate unfit for Product it &s;elf, with neither Ca&s;h, nor Credit, to Buy in other Places.</P>
<P>At la&s;t 'tis apparent, That, notwith&s;tanding the Proclamations, and after all the Officious Care of the Governours of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies, yet &s;everal Sloops of Provi&s;ions came to them, but found them on the other Hand unfurni&s;h'd to purcha&s;e, except with &s;uch Goods as were fit for no Market, nor could they give Bills any where to make Good the Value.</P>
<P>The Trade to the <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies</HI> is forbidden in tho&s;e Parts, under the &s;evere&s;t Penalties of Lo&s;s of Goods, Confi&s;cation of the Ship, and Death of the People; And yet we &s;ee, That, at <HI>Ja|maica</HI> for the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Cura&s;oe</HI> for the <HI>Dutch,</HI> they carry on a prodigious Trade encouraged by the Gain of it.</P>
<P>Had the <HI>Scots</HI> at <HI>Darien</HI> had any thing &s;ufficient to encoutage the Traders thither, they had never wanted Provi&s;ions; And as they were unprovided that way, they mu&s;t have &s;tarved, had there been no Prohibitions at all, for they would have found few of the Planters, or Merchants of the Colonies, inclined to have furni&s;h'd them without Money.</P>
<P>This I think clears up the Ca&s;e &s;ufficiently, and therefore I &s;hall &s;ay no more to it here; 'Tis thus far to the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, <HI>That,</HI> This Di&s;a&s;ter of the <HI>Scots, be the Fault where it will,</HI> was one of the great Occa&s;ions of Ill Blood between the Nations, while tho&s;e that took all Opportunities to widen our Breaches on both Sides, con|tinually cryed out in <HI>England,</HI> That the <HI>Scots</HI> were encroaching upon our Trade, and &s;etting up a New <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade&mdash;; And, on the other Hand, in <HI>Scotland,</HI> they complained of the Un|natural and Barbarous Treatment of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>&mdash;; Both which took with the Common People of either Nations, to the Un|&s;peakable Di&s;quieting of their Minds, and rai&s;ing continual Re|proaches again&s;t one another, without giving them&s;elves leave to enquire into the Grounds and Rea&s;ons of Things.</P>
<P>I have been the larger on this Head, becau&s;e I think this to be the fir&s;t Handle that our Quarrel&s;ome People took Hold of to Ob|ject again&s;t one another, and on which the future Jealou&s;ies between the Nations were pretended to be built.</P>
<P>The Affair of <HI>Glenco</HI> was another Step to National Breaches; And tho' every Body tells me, I mu&s;t handle this very gently, perhaps they may &s;ee, there is not &s;o much Cau&s;e for it, as they imagine.</P>
<P>And having the Honour to have had &s;omething of this from Per&s;ons very near the King, and perhaps from His Maje&s;ties own Mouth; I &s;hall only &s;tate the General &s;o far as it has been report|ed to the Injury of that Glorious Prince, and to the exciting Natio|nal Animo&s;ities between us.</P>
<P>In doing this, I &s;hall only avoid Naming of Per&s;ons, let the Guilt dye in their Graves, we are not now calling up the Per&s;ons to Judgment, but &s;etting the Matter in a clear Light.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="70">
That the <HI>Glenco-men</HI> among &s;everal other <HI>Clans</HI> of the <HI>High|landers,</HI> were Enemies to the Government at that time, had been in Arms under <HI>Dundee,</HI> and had on all occa&s;ions &s;hown their impla|cable Aver&s;ion to King <HI>William,</HI> and all the Intere&s;t of the Revolu|tion, needs no Proof, and is own'd even by the greate&s;t Friends to the Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>That the&s;e People were not only very trouble&s;ome, bu tdange|rous, and had committed &s;everal Ho&s;tilities, Murders, Robberies and Depredations, on both the Innocent Country People their Neigh|bours, as well as on the Garri&s;ons of Souldiers plac'd on that &s;ide to &s;uppre&s;s them, is al&s;o out of di&s;pute.</P>
<P>The Defence made for this is &s;hort, That they were fair Enemies and had profe&s;&s;'t open War.</P>
<P>It is An&s;wered thus, That <LIST>
<ITEM>1. They cannot be own'd as open Enemies, becau&s;e they really had no Commi&s;&s;ions from King <HI>James.</HI> And 2<HI>ly,</HI> The War was as it were &s;uppre&s;t; the Generality had laid down their Arms, and &s;ubmitted; and the&s;e as a few De&s;perado's kept up the Quarrel rather as an advantage of Rapine and Plunder, than a Service to their pretended Ma&s;ter, or his Cau&s;e.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Suppo&s;e them at open War, It has been the known Prac|tice in War, when a Governour of a Garri&s;on holds out with|out Expectation of Relief, without any pro&s;pect but meer De&s;|peration and Mi&s;chief, to give &s;uch no Quarter; no Conditions at all, but even after taking the Place to hang them up in cold Blood, as wild Bea&s;ts, that make no fair War, and de&s;erve no fair Treatment.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>As His Maje&s;ty had this Account given him of the&s;e People, and I do not find but it was a true Account too, it was the Advice of the General and Officers imployed at that time, that it was a Mi&s;|chief which as Times then went might be very dangerous to the Pub|lick; &amp; that therefore it behoved them to take &s;ome immediate Cour&s;e with them; And &s;ince de&s;perate Mi&s;chiefs require Remedies of the &s;ame kind, they thought the fir&s;t Force the be&s;t, and propo&s;ed to march immediately with a Body of Troops into the Place, and in|tirely root them out as a Den of Thieves and De&s;troyers, without which the peaceable Subjects could never be &s;afe, nor the Govern|ment be ea&s;ie; That the Charge of maintaining Troops there, was an in|tolerable Burden to the Countrey, and as there was no other way could prevail to pre&s;erve the Peace, it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to come to Extremity.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty, who by his Experience in Military Affairs, was &s;oon convinc'd both of the Ju&s;tice in Point of War, &amp; Nece&s;&s;ity in Point of Government of this Advice; yet out of His meer Goodne&s;s of Di&s;po&s;ition &amp; general Clemency, an&s;wered, <HI>He agreed to their Rea&s;ons,</HI> but requi|red that before any &s;uch Extremities &s;hould be u&s;ed with them, a Proclamation &s;hould be publi&s;hed, offering Pardon, or Remi&s;&s;ion for all Violences, and Villanies pa&s;t, to all the&s;e People without Excep|tion, who within a certain time &s;hould come in, lay down their
<PB N="38" REF="71">
Arms, and &s;ubmit to the Government, and take the Oaths as peace|able Subjects.</P>
<P>'Tis here vi&s;ible that His Maje&s;ties Intentions were not only Ju&s;t and Honourable to the&s;e People, <HI>tho his implacable Enemies,</HI> but that he re&s;olved like a merciful Prince, to try all rea&s;onable Me|thods of Tenderne&s;s, and Goodne&s;s, if po&s;&s;ible, to keep the Peace, and &s;ave the Offenders too.</P>
<P>With this Proclamation, Commi&s;&s;ion was given to the Military Power, if this merciful Method could not prevail, they &s;hould proceed to Extremities; and by Force of Arms de&s;troy all tho&s;e that &s;hould &s;tand out, and not comply with the Proclamation. And His Maje&s;ties Orders were, as far as relates to this part, as follows.</P>
<P>The In&s;tructions were to Sir <HI>Thomas Livingstoun,</HI> dated <HI>Jan.</HI> 11. 1692. the fir&s;t Clau&s;e is thus,</P>
<P><HI>You are hereby Ordered and Authorized to march our Troops which are now posted at</HI> Innerlochie <HI>and</HI> Innerne&s;s <HI>to act again&s;t tho&s;e Highland Rebels who have not taken the benefite of Our Indem|nity, by Fire and Sword, and all manner of Hostilities, to burn their Hou&s;es, &s;eize or de&s;troy their Goods, Cattel, Pleni&s;hing or Clothes, and to cut off the Men.</HI></P>
<P>The Fourth Article runs thus,</P>
<P><HI>That the Rebels may not think them&s;elves ab&s;olutely de&s;perate, we allow you to give Terms and Quarters, but we are &s;o convinc'd of the Nece&s;&s;ity of Severity, and that they cannot be reclaim'd, that we will not allow you to give any other Terms to Chiftains, Heretors, or Leaders, but to be Pri&s;oners of War, whereby their Lives are &s;aved; but for all other things they mu&s;t &s;urrender on Mercy, and take the Oath of Alledgeance.</HI></P>
<P>In Additional In&s;tructions, one Clau&s;e is thus dated 16 <HI>Jan.</HI> 1692.</P>
<P><HI>If that</HI> Mackean <HI>of</HI> Glenco <HI>and his Tribe can be well &s;eparated from the rest, it will be a proper Vindication of the publick justice to ex|tirpate that Sect of Thieves.</HI></P>
<P>Thus far I think I may undertake to &s;ay His Maje&s;ty proceeded, by the known Cu&s;tom of all the mo&s;t ju&s;t Governments in the World, and it would be needle&s;s to Examine Hi&s;tories to bring Precedents here to ju&s;tifie the Method.</P>
<P>It is certain, and all Men allow that the <HI>Glenco-men</HI> had not com|plyed with the Proclamation; Nay they had rejected two Indemni|ties.</P>
<P>I know 'tis objected, that <HI>Glenco</HI> came and took the Oath &s;ix days after the time, made a legal and ju&s;t Excu&s;e, and &s;ent word of his willingne&s;s to comply with it, and that it was only a Tre&s;pa&s;s of Time, which they &s;uppo&s;ed he had repaired, that the end of the Proclamation was an&s;wered, and that the King who was mercifully inclin'd, would never have taken the Lives of People re&s;olved to &s;ubmit for a Tre&s;pa&s;s of days.</P>
<P>To this I an&s;wer, as His Maje&s;ty him&s;elf did in that Ca&s;e, that indeed had he been in the Field, and on the Spot, and that Excu&s;e had been &s;ent to him, he might have accepted it&mdash;, But that as
<PB N="39" REF="72">
Commi&s;&s;ions in Ca&s;es of War, are to be punctually Executed, he could not require it of the Officers to accept it, as an Excu&s;e again&s;t a po&s;itive Proclamation, and an expre&s;s Order; Be&s;ides, I do not find any, but the Chief had gone thus far, the re&s;t not having come in at all.</P>
<P>It is alledged, That the Execution was from private Malice&mdash;; but none could ever yet have the Face to charge His Maje&s;ty with that, and I could never hear of any Rea&s;on given why the Com|manders of the Forces &s;hould have any, much le&s;s tho&s;e at whom the Scandal of it was pointed, upon pretence of giving Unwar|rantable Orders.</P>
<P>But the Ca&s;e chiefly lyes here, the Men fell under the Misfortune of a Cri&s;is in War, they brought them&s;elves into it by an Omi&s;&s;ion of Time, to &s;ay, They could not avoid it, does not reach the Ca&s;e, if the Officers can be charged with any private Revenge in this Ca&s;e, I have only this to &s;ay.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. I never yet &s;aw any Rea&s;on to think &s;o, no Per&s;onal Grudge or Quarrel ever appeared, that I ever met with, or was &s;o much as&mdash;, alledged in it, or Gain pretended to be made by it, if the E. of <HI>B.</HI>&mdash;had any private Game, it nei|ther affected the King, nor the other Per&s;ons Charged with the Thing.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. If it were &s;o, it no way affects the King, again&s;t whom the Reproach of this Affair is &s;ince pointed, who acted no|thing but what was agreeable to the Laws of War, and mixt it with that General Ble&s;&s;ing of his Temper, an unu&s;ual Cle|mency.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>If the Commi&s;&s;ion given was Executed with Barbarity, and Blood, Killing People in what we call cold Blood, &s;urprizing them in Peace, and Dependence on Safety, all this will turn upon the Merits of the fir&s;t Cau&s;e; For if they were by the Laws of War to be De&s;troyed, all manner of Surprizes become Ju&s;tified by the &s;ame Law: As to the Cruelties and Exce&s;&s;es of the Furious Soldiers, no Man can have the Face to Reproach His Maje&s;ty with that.</P>
<P>The Grand Que&s;tion remains yet behind, Why did not the King cau&s;e the Offenders to be made Examples, and &s;everely puni&s;h the Murderers.</P>
<P>I &s;hall An&s;wer,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. If His Maje&s;ties Peculiar was too much Clemency, I think &s;ome of tho&s;e that make loude&s;t Exclamations on this Article ought to be &s;ilent, &s;ince, had Exemplar Ju&s;tice been His Ma|je&s;ties Employment from his fir&s;t Landing, we &s;hould have no Rea&s;on to have &s;aid, It was a Bloodle&s;s Revolution, nor they perhaps have been alive to Complain.</ITEM>

For the Rea&s;ons afore&s;aid, His Maje&s;ty often &s;aid, it was <HI>a Moot-point</HI> in War, whether they had broke Orders or no, and tho' I have the Honour to know, that His Maje&s;ty ex|ceedingly re&s;ented the Manner, yet it did not appear at all, that they had laid them&s;elves open to Military Ju&s;tice in it,
<PB N="40" REF="73">
or &s;o much as given ground to call them to account before a Council of War.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>As to National or Civil Ju&s;tice, the Memory of the King can never be Reflected upon in that, unle&s;s &s;ome Per&s;ons had pur&s;ued them at Law, obtained Sentence again&s;t them, and His Maje&s;ty had Protected them from the Pro&s;ecution or Execution of &s;uch Sen|tences.</P>
<P>Thus far, I think, the King him&s;elf is intirely clear of this Mat|ter, who el&s;e may have been Guilty, and how, either of breaking Orders, going beyond them on Niceties, and Executing them with Barbarities, I have no Occa&s;ion to enter upon here; I &s;hall be far from Defending &s;uch Things, and I am &s;ure His Maje&s;ty was far from Approving it.</P>
<P>But this is more compleatly An&s;wered, by putting the World in mind, That His Maje&s;ty did refer the Pro&s;ecution of that Affair wholly to the Parliament, as more particularly appears by the Par|liaments Addre&s;s of Thanks to His Maje&s;ty for &s;o doing.</P>
<P>And that in their Pro&s;ecution, they found no room for legal Pro|ce&s;s, except again&s;t the Officer who Executed the Orders in a man|ner &s;o Barbarous, which Officer fled from Ju&s;tice, and was Pro|&s;cribed for not Compearing.</P>
<P>So that here was no legal Proce&s;s interrupted, but all was Frank|ly remitted by His Maje&s;ty to the &s;evere&s;t Methods of Ju&s;tice, which if it would not reach the Per&s;ons concerned, 'tis very hard the Slander &s;hould reach the King.</P>
<P>It might be &s;aid here, You have no Occa&s;ion to Defend the King's Memory in this Ca&s;e, &s;ince the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> clear'd His Maje&s;ty, by their Unanimous Vote of 14<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>June, viz.</HI> That His Maje&s;ties In&s;tructions contained no Warrant for the Execution of the <HI>Glenco</HI> Men.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only Note, That it is true the Parliament pa&s;t &s;uch a Vote, and 'tis as true, the King re&s;ented very ill their U&s;age of him, as he had great Rea&s;on to do, frequently repeating, That he Thank|ed the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> they had u&s;ed him better than <HI>Eng|land</HI> had done his Grandfather, for they had Tryed him for his Life, and brought him in <HI>NOT G&V;ILTY.</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s, it was very Unaccountable the Hou&s;e &s;hould pa&s;s &s;uch a Vote upon their Sovereign, whom no Man had had the Impudence to owne a Re|flection upon in the Ca&s;e, tho' they did it Clande&s;tinely; and it had much better have become them, to have Searched after, and Puni&s;hed tho&s;e that Slandered the King on that Account.</P>
<P>But the Reproaching the King, and tho&s;e imployed by him, and who under him gave Orders in it, had its Party U&s;es; what End it an&s;wered at that Time, is very well known, and would make a very good Hi&s;tory, to the Reproach of &s;ome Pretenders to Revolu|tion Principles; But I choo&s;e to bury the&s;e Things in Silence, nei|ther are they any part of this De&s;ign.</P>
<P>I have A&s;&s;ign'd this as a &s;econd Ground of National Animo&s;ity, not that it was Acted by any of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, but as the
<PB N="41" REF="74">
Gentlemen who improved it, turned it all again&s;t the King, it was &s;till furni&s;hing matter of Railry again&s;t the Revolution, and Suc|ce&s;&s;ion, which both turned upon one Point, and was now &s;up|ported and pu&s;ht on in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by the Intere&s;t and Influence of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court.</P>
<P>I have Digre&s;t upon the Subject on no other Ground, than to clear up the Reproaches which Envy would fain fix on the King and his Memory, which, I think, not at all accountable for it.</P>
<P N="3">3. The next General Head, on which our National Di&s;contents have been Revived, and indeed which has been &s;trangely I&s;&s;ued, has been the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Crown.</P>
<P>This has a long Chain of Derivations to fetch it from, but I'll Contract them into as &s;mall a Compa&s;s as I can.</P>
<P>The Original of the whole Debate is to be placed, if we will do Ju&s;tice, in His late Maje&s;ties &s;incere and con&s;tant Care for the Peace and Security of the&s;e Kingdoms.</P>
<P>The King had &s;een the Pro&s;pects of an <HI>&V;nion</HI> fly like a remote Shadow, as it were out of Ken, and finding rea&s;on to lay a&s;ide the Thoughts of that ble&s;&s;ed Conjunction, he found the next Step needful was, to pre&s;erve the Publick Peace, and hand down our Liberties to Po&s;terity, under the &s;ame Security he had &s;o happily Fixt them in; in order to this, His Maje&s;ty began to &s;et him&s;elf &s;eriou&s;ly to Work, to &s;ettle the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Crown in the Prote&s;tant Line.</P>
<P>Before I enter into this large Field, I mu&s;t take one Opportunity more to Exalt the Memory of the King, and put the&s;e Nations in mind of the Care that Prince took, ab&s;tracted from his own In|tere&s;t, to &s;ettle both the Liberties and Religion of this I&s;land, in &s;pight of all the ill Treatment he met with here.</P>
<P>Upon the Revolution, a great deal of Clamour and Reproach had been Level'd at the King, as if he pur&s;ued his own Intere&s;t in the taking the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> tho' I mu&s;t acknowledge I am at a Lo&s;s, to find out what he Gain'd by it, tho' I have had Opportunities to know &s;omething of His Maje&s;ties Affairs; But &s;ure, no Body could Charge His Maje&s;ty with having an Eye to his Intere&s;t, in what &s;hould happen after his Death; He could have nothing to propo&s;e to him&s;elf beyond the Grave; It could be of no Moment to him, who &s;hould Enjoy the Crown after him, &s;ince he had no Children of his own, nor could he expect the Succe&s;&s;ion &s;hould come to any Branch of his Family.</P>
<P>Covetou&s;ne&s;s and Ambition may guide Princes in their Pur&s;uit of Honours and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, to them&s;elves and their Families, but when a Prince has no Family, no Relations that can Enjoy after him, it can not be Rational to talk of Ambition or Intere&s;t in that Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ties Memory is therefore Untainted, and even the Ene|mies of his Fame are Defeated <HI>here;</HI> for <HI>the very pretence fails them,</HI> his Anxiety for the Settlement of the Succe&s;&s;ion, could &s;avour of nothing but a meer Concern and Re&s;pect for the Intere&s;t, Safety,
<PB N="42" REF="75">
and Liberty of the Countrey, and let any Man give any other ra|tional Account of it, if he can; <HI>But this is by the way.</HI></P>
<P>In pur&s;uit of this Original De&s;ign, His Maje&s;ty laid the Ground-Plot of the Succe&s;&s;ion to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hannover,</HI> went him&s;elf to <HI>Hannover,</HI> and thence to <HI>Zell,</HI> to Concert the Mea&s;ures of it on that Side, Ma&s;ter'd &s;ome Difficulties there too, and then propo&s;ed it to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament.</P>
<P>How it pa&s;&s;ed in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, what Oppo&s;ition was made to it <HI>there, and by whom,</HI> what &s;ub&s;equent Laws were made to &s;trengthen and &s;upport it, is not much to the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e to Examine, Hi&s;tories are full of the particular Circum&s;tances, and no Body that knows any thing of what pa&s;t in tho&s;e Times, can be ignorant of it.</P>
<P>It remained only to make the &s;ame Provi&s;ion for <HI>Scotland;</HI> and the King began to turn his Eyes thither, when he was taken off by Death; And Queen <HI>ANNE</HI> Succeeded not to his Crown only, but to the &s;ame Care and Concern for the Publick Peace, and for the Settlement of the Nations, by &s;ecuring the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Crown.</P>
<P>But to look into <HI>Scotland</HI> a little, the <HI>Scots</HI> receiv'd the Propo&s;al of the Succe&s;&s;ion, with more Coldne&s;s &amp; Diffidence than was expected; and the Heats occa&s;ioned by the Debates on both Sides, were Ex|traordinary; The Oppo&s;ition made to the Continuation of their United State in a Succe&s;&s;or, had a &s;pecious and mo&s;t unan&s;werable Pretence to be made for it, tho' it was made U&s;e of by two &s;orts of People, with a quite different Pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> had been very &s;en&s;ible of the vi&s;ible Decay of Trade, Wealth, and Inhabitants in their Country, even from the fir&s;t giving away their Kings to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion, and as the Sinking Condition of their Nation, was plainly owing to the Lo&s;s of their Court, Concour&s;e of People, the Di&s;advantages of Trade, and the Influence the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had over their Kings; So it was as plain, there was no way to Recover them&s;elves, but either better Terms of Union and Alliance, or a Returning back to their &s;eparate Self-Exi&s;ting State.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t Confidering and Di&s;intere&s;ted People, Reflected back upon their Ea&s;ie Complying with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and Joyning with the Revolution, without any Conditions made for them&s;elves with <HI>England</HI> as a Nation; <HI>And plainy &s;aid,</HI> If they had demanded bet|ter Terms, they might have had them, &s;ince their Joyning at that Time was a Thing of &s;uch Con&s;equence, and upon which &s;o much did Depend, that <HI>England</HI> could not have denied them, and what they had to ask was &s;o rea&s;onable, that nothing in rea&s;on could have been objected.</P>
<P>The People who were of this Opinion, being &s;ome of them at the &s;ame Time, as far from Embarking in the wrong Intere&s;t, Mov'd Strenuou&s;ly for a Treaty with <HI>England,</HI> to a&s;certain the Con|ditions, <HI>Chiefly re&s;pecting Commerce,</HI> on which they were willing to
<PB N="43" REF="76">
&s;ettle the Crown; but were Unanimou&s;ly for refu&s;ing to &s;ettle it at all, <HI>but with &s;uch a Treaty.</HI></P>
<P>As the&s;e Gentlemen in&s;i&s;ted upon a Treaty with <HI>England,</HI> in ca&s;e they &s;ettled the Succe&s;&s;ion with them, &s;o they con&s;idered in the next place of Limitations, both in ca&s;e of failing of &s;uch Treaty, or in ca&s;e of its being Concluded, in order to pre&s;erve the Liberties of the People, and to A&s;&s;ert the Right and Power of Parliaments; And one of the&s;e Limitations was, That in ca&s;e the Treaty did not &s;ucceed then in the &s;ettling the Crown, it was Provided, the Suc|ce&s;&s;or &s;hould not be King or Queen of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And yet I confe&s;s it &s;eems plain to me, the De&s;ign of the&s;e Peo|ple was not again&s;t having the Succe&s;&s;ion &s;ettled even in Conjuncti|on with <HI>England,</HI> as it now is, and their General Behaviour &s;ince, Confirms this Opinion, be&s;ides the General Character of the Men them&s;elves, but their De&s;ign appeared plainly to bring <HI>England</HI> over to &s;uch Terms in Matters of Commerce, as really it appeared <HI>Scot|land</HI> wanted, and as <HI>England</HI> ought to Grant.</P>
<P>'Tis true, a Party Joyn'd in this, that were again&s;t any Conjuncti|on at all, that were again&s;t any Succe&s;&s;ion but that of King <HI>James,</HI> and who&s;e real De&s;ign was again&s;t the General Corre&s;pondence of the Nations, and both Sides had People among them who made u&s;e of the&s;e Things, further and further to Divide the Nation.</P>
<P>Nor did they fail of Succe&s;s, for this was taken very Hainou&s;ly in <HI>England,</HI> e&s;pecially by the ignorant kind of People, and they began in <HI>England</HI> to Treat the <HI>Scots</HI> very Cour&s;ely; The Writers of the Age began to Di&s;cu&s;s the &s;eparate Sovereignties, and Exalt the Titles of either Side.</P>
<P>In <HI>England,</HI> one Doctor <HI>Drake</HI> Writes a Preface to an Abridge|ment of the <HI>Scots</HI> Hi&s;tory, wherein &s;peaking &s;omething Reflecting upon the Freedom and Independency of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> Parlia|ment cau&s;ed it to be Burnt by the Hangman at <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> Another <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Author Writes of the Ab&s;olute Dominion of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Crown over the Crown of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but he received the ju&s;t Pu|ni&s;hment of being little regarded; Another Writes of the Ea&s;ine&s;s of Reducing <HI>Scotland</HI> by Arms&mdash;. Again&s;t the&s;e Mr. <HI>Ander&s;on, Hodges,</HI> and others, Write of the Antiquity, Freedom, and Inde|pendency of <HI>Scotland,</HI> A&s;&s;erting it in the Face of the World, for which Books the Parliament Rewarded them publickly.</P>
<P>Thus, on both Sides, the Ca&s;e &s;tood between the Nations, a Pen and Ink War made a daily Noi&s;e in either Kingdom, and this &s;er|ved to Exa&s;perate the People in &s;uch a manner, one again&s;t ano|ther, that never have two Nations Run upon one another in &s;uch a manner, and come off without Blows.</P>
<P>The Heats on both Sides being thus &s;trangely blown up, and the People of either Kingdom beginning to run into Exce&s;&s;es&mdash;, ju&s;t in this Juncture, as if the Nature and Nece&s;&s;ity of the Thing had driven both Nations to it, the Queen propo&s;es to the re&s;pective Parliaments, a Treaty of Union to be begun between the two King|doms; This was in the year 1702, the Well-Wi&s;hers to the Na|tions
<PB N="44" REF="77">
Peace earne&s;tly longed for this Union on both Sides; But I cannot &s;ay that they had equal Expectations of it, as Times then went.</P>
<P>It was the fir&s;t year of Her Maje&s;ty's Reign, and the Admini&s;trati|on of things being then <HI>in hands</HI> in both Kingdoms, which Her Maje&s;ty afterward thought fit to change, there is not &s;o much won|der why this Treaty came to nothing.</P>
<P>There had been Ob&s;tructions to the De&s;ign in <HI>Scotland,</HI> where Things were yet carried with more Jealou&s;ie of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court than afterwards they &s;aw Rea&s;on to do; This occa&s;ioned a Prote&s;t from one &s;ort of Gentlemen again&s;t the Queens Naming the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners to Treat&mdash;; But even the very Gentlemen who prote&s;t|ed, thought fit afterwards to come in to the Union as it was pro|po&s;ed, and had no &s;mall Influence in the Succe&s;s of it.</P>
<P>The Succe&s;s of the Union no doubt depended upon the Choice of the Per&s;ons appointed to Treat, and this depended very much on the Repre&s;entation of the Mini&s;try in either Nation to the Queen. As to the Mini&s;try in <HI>Scotland</HI> I &s;hall &s;ay nothing, the Gentlemen nominated there might perhaps have come into Mea&s;ures for a Trea|ty well enough, mo&s;t of the former Treaters being the &s;ame as af|terwards fini&s;hed it&mdash;; But the De&s;ign of the Mini&s;try in <HI>England</HI> &s;eemed to act upon Mea&s;ures not &s;o con&s;i&s;tent with the true Intent and Meaning of the Treaty as could have been wi&s;ht.</P>
<P>Again the Jealou&s;ne&s;s on both &s;ides about Church Affairs, in re|&s;pect to the Union, were the ground of &s;uch Difficulties as no Body could &s;urmount, and lay as a Secret Mine, with which that Party who de&s;igned to keep the Nation divided, were &s;ure to blow it up at la&s;t, and therefore knew that all they did till that Point was di&s;|cu&s;t &s;ignified nothing, and that when ever they plea&s;ed to put an end to it, they had an immediate Opportunity.</P>
<P>Without therefore entring upon &s;uch ju&s;t Reflections as I might very well be allowed to make upon the &s;everal Per&s;ons, and Parts acting and acted in that, <HI>I had almost &s;aid &s;ham Treaty,</HI> I may place the whole Mi&s;carriages of it very ju&s;tly upon <HI>this one Parti|cular, viz,</HI> That the Affairs of Religion were left to the ab&s;olute Determination and Appointment of the Treaters, and this might have in&s;tructed any Body that this Treaty would come to nothing, &s;ince it was morally impracticable that the Nice Article of Religion, as it particularly then &s;tood between the two Churches, could have been &s;ettled to the mutual Satisfaction of both Kingdoms by a Com|mi&s;&s;ion, in which there was not one Per&s;on deputed or named by the Church, or in&s;tructed by them to enter upon the &s;everal Articles of a Treaty on either Hand.</P>
<P>I know it has been &s;aid, <HI>and perhaps there may have been &s;ome Truth in it,</HI> That the Article of Religion was to have lien pa&s;&s;ive and dormant, and neither Side was to have concerned them&s;elves a|bout it, by which &s;ome would have had it under&s;tood, that either Side was to remain in the Condition they were then in&mdash;, and that this was the Meaning of the words of a certain Per&s;on, who when
<PB N="45" REF="78">
he was ask't, what Care was taken of the Church in that Treaty, Replyed, <HI>For GOD's Sake, let Us have no more of that Jargon.</HI></P>
<P>I confe&s;s, It's a charitable Con&s;truction of the Words, to &s;ay, The Author only meant that Things &s;hould be left to &s;tand as they were, and the Treaters &s;hould have no other Concern about it,&mdash;but I pre&s;ume tho&s;e People hardly con&s;idered that then the E&s;tabli&s;hment of either Church had been left intirely to the future Di&s;po&s;ition of a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, who, whenever they were governed by a Majority on this or that Side might have Over-whelmed intirely the <HI>Scots</HI> Set|tlement, and erected Epi&s;copacy upon them, or <HI>Vice ver&s;a</HI> with the Church of <HI>England:</HI> And I pre&s;ume neither Church would have thought them&s;elves &s;afe upon &s;uch a Foundation, I am &s;ure, they would not have had Rea&s;on to have thought &s;o.</P>
<P>Such a Precarious Union mu&s;t needs have begot future Convul&s;i|ons in both Kingdoms; And <HI>if We may judge by what has happned &s;ince,</HI> the Treaters would have met with but very Ordinary Recep|tion in <HI>Scotland</HI> when they came Home, and the abandoning the Church to the Mercy of the Parliament, which was in Effect, giving Her up to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> would certainly have Inflamed the whole Countrey.</P>
<P>It is therefore the much kinder Reflection to &s;ay the&s;e Gentlemen never de&s;igned any Union at all, &s;ince to &s;uppo&s;e the other, would be to &s;ugge&s;t that they de&s;igned to give up their Native Countrey to a Bondage in Matters Religious, which they knew was Intolerable to their Countrey, and to lead them by the Hand to an Inevitable Breach between the Nations.</P>
<P>For this Rea&s;on I &s;ay, that Treaty was never &s;incerely de&s;ign'd; if it was, it mu&s;t reflect either upon the Under&s;tandings, or upon the Integrity of the Per&s;ons concern'd.</P>
<P>However, as I am here upon Matters of Hi&s;tory, and collecting together all that has been done with relation to uniting the King|doms, as well what was Abortive as what came to Perfection; I think this Work cannot be compleat without giving you the Minutes of this Treaty al&s;o, as far as it proceeded&mdash;; But becau&s;e I would not interrupt the Threed of Hi&s;tory, I have adjourned it to the <HI>Appendix,</HI> where you have it at large, as I received it from the hand of a Per&s;on of Honour and undoubted Integrity, who was one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners to that Treaty, and wrote it down with his own Hand. The Minutes are marked in the <HI>Appendix</HI> (N 14.)</P>
<P>Upon the breaking up of this Treaty, three things happned to the further widening the unhappy Breaches between the Nations, which however they di&s;covered the furious Temper of a Party of Men in both Kingdoms, ready and forward to inflame us and in|volve both Nations in Blood, yet their evil De&s;ign had this happy I&s;&s;ue, that it brought the Nations to the <HI>Gri&s;is</HI> which inevitably brought on the great Treaty; it put us all into &s;uch a Condition, that nothing but a Treaty for a nearer Union, or a Bloody and Ir|reconcilable Rupture could be the Con&s;equence&mdash;. And this I
<PB N="46" REF="79">
take to be a moving Argument, which in the Judgment of the Mi|ni&s;try made the Treaty of Union ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and thus the greate&s;t Good came out of the greate&s;t de&s;igned Evil.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e was the Affair of Captain <HI>Green</HI> and the Ship <HI>Worce&s;ter.</HI> About the &leftblank; an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship called the <HI>Worcester</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> Captain <HI>Thomas Green</HI> Commander, Home|ward-bound from the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> put into <HI>Scotland,</HI> whether by contrary Winds, or for Convoy, or on what other occa&s;ion is not to the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>African</HI> Company there having a Ship formerly &s;eized by the <HI>East-India</HI> Company in <HI>London,</HI> as &s;he was fitting out in the River of <HI>Thames;</HI> And for which they had in vain &s;olicited Re&s;ti|tution, they obtain of the Government a Power to Seize and Stop this Ship by way of Repri&s;al.</P>
<P>Accordingly the Ship was &s;eized on, and brought into <HI>Brunt-i&s;land,</HI> and &s;ome time pa&s;&s;ed while the Ship lay under &s;uch Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>During this Time, &s;ome of the Ships Crew, whether in their Drink, or otherwi&s;e, let fall &s;ome Words, implying that they had been Pirating, and particularly &s;ome very &s;u&s;picious Di&s;cour&s;es, in|timating that there had been Blood in the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>This prompted further Enquiries, and at la&s;t a plain and particu|lar Information was procured, that this Captain <HI>Green</HI> with this Ship <HI>Worcester</HI> had met with a <HI>Scots</HI> Ship commanded by one <HI>&leftblank; Drummond</HI> in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> had made Prize of the Ship, and Murthered <HI>Drummond</HI> and all his Crew.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;u&s;picious and dark Speeches were &s;o taken hold of, and trac't, that at la&s;t it came upon the Stage, and brought <HI>Green</HI> and his Ships Crew into the Cour&s;e of publick Ju&s;tice, and after a very long Tryal, they were found guilty of <HI>Piracy, Robbe|ry</HI> and <HI>Murder;</HI> And particularly the Captain and five more were condemned to Dye for it, and the Captain with two more were ac|cordingly executed.</P>
<P>It is not the work of this Book to relate that Story at its full length, but I can not pa&s;s it here without a &s;hort Abridgement of the Proceedings; Becau&s;e as <HI>Scotland</HI> lyes under much Scandal on this Account, which, as to the Methods of publick Ju&s;tice, I think &s;he does not de&s;erve, &s;o the clearing up that Point, and the Relation it has to the pre&s;ent Subject I am upon, I think will come out Hand in Hand; and for that Rea&s;on I ingage in it.</P>
<P>Some of <HI>Green</HI>'s Men, either in their Anger, or their Cups, or both, having let fall Words that rendred him very much &s;u&s;pected of having been guilty of great Villanies, they were further watch|ed in their Di&s;cour&s;e by &s;ome that had taken hold of their Words, particularly two Negroes, one <HI>Haines,</HI> and another, who, it &s;eems, being di&s;gu&s;ted at the Captain, frequently let fall &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions as gave the Hearers Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect there had been great Villanies among them. The&s;e Speeches are all to be &s;een in the Depo&s;itions of the Witne&s;&s;es, too long to repeat here, and particularly in the Printed Tryal, to which I refer.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="80">
I &s;hall not take upon me here, either to Condemn or Acquit either Side, I know the World is divided on the Subject, &s;ome will have <HI>Green</HI> and his Crew, to be Guilty of all that is Charged on them; others &s;ay, The Company carried all again&s;t them, that they might have a good Pretence for Confi&s;cating the Ship. But be that as it will, it is mo&s;t certain, the Folly and Imprudence of the Men Hang|ed them, <HI>to &s;ay no more.</HI></P>
<P>From a little to more, from dark Expre&s;&s;ions, they fell to down|right Quarrelling, and calling one another Names, which there &s;eems to be good rea&s;on to believe, might in part be true on both Sides, <HI>For &s;ome of them, however innocent of this Matter, had been, it &s;eems, Guilty of Wickedne&s;&s;es of other &s;orts, black enough.</HI></P>
<P>This Folly of theirs, came at la&s;t to &s;uch a Hight, that it could be no longer Concealed, for it became the publick Di&s;cour&s;e, That they had been Guilty not of Murder and Piracy only, but of Un|common Barbarities, and not that only, but that it was particular|ly on a <HI>Scots</HI> Ship, and <HI>Scots</HI> Men, <HI>viz.</HI> Captain <HI>Drummond,</HI> as afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>At length it was brought to the Ears of the Government, and as the publick Ju&s;tice of all Nations is obliged to take Cogni&s;ance of &s;uch Horrid Things as were here &s;ugge&s;ted, the Fellows were Exa|mined, and they frankly Confe&s;&s;ing, <HI>Green</HI> and five of his Men were taken up; The po&s;itive Evidence were only two <HI>Negroes,</HI> but others &s;o Corroborated what they &s;aid, and Circum&s;tances con|curring, to make almo&s;t every Body believe the Fact, at lea&s;t in that Hurry, they were upon a long Hearing &s;everally found Guilty of Piracy and Murder.</P>
<P>There are &s;ometimes &s;uch Cri&s;is, &s;uch Junctures in Matters, when all Things &s;hall concur to po&s;&s;e&s;s, not a Man, but even a Nation with a Belief, of what at another Time they would not believe, even upon the &s;ame Evidence; And, <HI>in this,</HI> Man &s;eems acted by a kind of &s;upernatural Influence, as if invi&s;ibly directed, to bring to pa&s;s &s;ome particular Thing pointed out by Providence to be done, for Rea&s;ons of his own, and known only to his In&s;crutable Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t &s;uch a Ca&s;e this &s;eemed to be; the Circum&s;tances of <HI>Green</HI> and his Crew, were very Unhappy for them; Their being put into <HI>Scotland,</HI> where they had no manner of Bu&s;ine&s;s, no Di&s;tre&s;s to Force them in; Their being Seized by the Company, the Mens fal|ling out among them&s;elves, and being the open In&s;truments of De|tecting, what no one ever could ha' Charged them with, their &s;tay|ing there when they might have gone, and had no more Bu&s;ine&s;s there, from whence &s;ome alledge, they had no power to depart; The&s;e, and more concurring Circum&s;tances which were ob&s;erved by the mo&s;t curious, and &s;ome of which were Noted upon the Trial, &s;eem'd to Jump together &s;o vi&s;ibly, that all People &s;eem'd to acknowledge a wonderful and invi&s;ible Hand in it, directing and pointing out the Detecting &s;ome Horrible Crime, which Ven|geance &s;uffered not to go Unpuni&s;hed.</P>

Nor was this the &s;en&s;e of a few, but Generally &s;peaking of the whole Nation, I mean of con&s;idering People, and &s;uch as u&s;ually notice &s;uch Things, and particularly of many of tho&s;e who cried out loude&s;t of the matter, when it was too late to apply any Re|medy, in which, I cannot but think, they act Unkindly to their Country, and indeed very Unju&s;tly, &s;ince, when the Conviction of &s;uch Circum&s;tances was on the minds of the People, It is no wonder the Men were found Guilty by the Jury; and I per&s;wade my &s;elf, they them&s;elves would have done the &s;ame.</P>
<P>On their being found Guilty, they were not immediately Executed, but &s;everal Applications were made to <HI>England</HI> for their Reprive; the Council of <HI>Scotland</HI> Reprived them for &s;ome Days; And as &s;ome People began then to object, That the Evidence was but too &s;light, and that there was but one Witne&s;s to matter of Fact, and that the one Witne&s;s was but a <HI>Negroe,</HI> That he was not capable of the Impre&s;&s;ions of the Solemnity of an Oath, That there was Malice in it, and the like; On the&s;e, and other Con&s;iderations, the Govern|ment was &s;o Tender of the Blood of the Men, that &s;ome have thought they had not Died, but for the Rage of the Common People, who hearing that they were further to be Reprived, got together in an unu&s;ual Multitude, on the Day appointed for their Execution, crying out for Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>And this part of the Story, is the Occa&s;ion of my relating &s;o much of it, &s;ince the Tendency it had to Inflame the Nations one again&s;t another, began here.</P>
<P>On the Day appointed for Execution, the Privy Council was Set, and the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> were called to A&s;&s;i&s;t&mdash;, where the Point was Debated, Whether the Condemned Per&s;ons &s;hould be Executed, or no; I will not &s;ay the Rabble Influenc'd the Council in their Determinations that way&mdash;; But this is certain, That the Di&s;content of the Common People was very well known, and that they were Furiou&s;ly bent upon &s;ome Violent Methods, was very much feared&mdash;; That a va&s;t Concour&s;e of People was ga|thered at that In&s;tant in the Parliament Clo&s;s, at the Cro&s;s, at the Pri&s;on, and throughout the whole City, that they publickly Threat|ned the Magi&s;trates, and even the Council it &s;elf, in ca&s;e they were not brought out that Day, and &s;ome talked of pulling down the Tolbooth, which if they had Attempted, they would have Sa|crificed them in a way more like that of <HI>De Wit,</HI> than an Executi|on of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>However, it was the Council Determined the matter, that Three of them, <HI>viz.</HI> The Captain <HI>Thomas Green, John Mather,</HI> and <HI>James Simp&s;on,</HI> who were thought to be Principals in the Murder, &s;hould be put to Death that Day.</P>
<P>When the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> came out, they a&s;&s;ured the People, That they were Ordered to be Executed, and that if they would have a little patience, they would &s;ee them brought out; and this pacified them for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="82">
Soon after the Council breaking up, My Lord Chancellor came out, and driving down the Street in his Coach, as he pa&s;t by the Cro&s;s, &s;ome Body &s;aid aloud, <HI>The Magistrates had but cheated them, and that the Council had repriv'd the Criminals</HI>&mdash;; This run|ning like Wild-fire was &s;pread in a Moment among the People; immediately they ran in a Fury down the Street after the Chancellor, &s;topt his Coach ju&s;t at the <HI>Trone-Church,</HI> broke the Gla&s;&s;es, abu&s;ed his Servants, and forc't him out of the Coach; &s;ome Friends that were concerned for the Hazard he was in, got him into a Hou&s;e, &s;o that he had no per&s;onal Hurt: 'twas in Vain for his Lord&s;hip to prote&s;t to them that the Men were ordered to be executed, they were then pa&s;t Hearing of any Thing, the whole Town was in an Up|roar, and not the Mob of the City, but even from all the Adjacent Countrey was come together, Nothing, but the Blood of the Pri&s;on|ers could appea&s;e them: and had not the Execution followed imme|diately, it cannot be expre&s;s'd, what Mi&s;chief might have hap|pened.</P>
<P>At la&s;t the Pri&s;oners were brought out, and led through the Streets down to <HI>Leith,</HI> the Place of Execution, being by the Laws appointed there for Crimes committed upon the Sea&mdash;; The Fury and Rage of the People was &s;uch, that it is not to be expre&s;t, and hardly did they &s;uffer them to pa&s;s, or keep their Hands off from them as they went, but throw a thou&s;and In&s;ults, Taunts and Revilings; they were at la&s;t brought to the Gibbet erected at the Sea-Mark, and there hang'd.</P>
<P>Nor can I forget to Note, that no &s;ooner was the Sacrifice made, and the Men dead, but even the &s;ame Rabble, &s;o fickle is the Multi|tude, exclaim'd at their own Madne&s;s, and openly regrated what they had done, and were ready to tear one another to pieces for the Exce&s;s.</P>
<P>This was not acted there with more Fury, than it was with the outmo&s;t Indignation re&s;ented in <HI>England</HI>&mdash;, &s;till I am to be un|der&s;tood of the common People; For the Government of neither Side had any Re&s;entment or Di&s;pute, all things having been carried on by legal Methods, Proce&s;s and Tryal, according to the Form of Law and U&s;age of the Country.</P>
<P>But here was new Matter for the Enemies of both Nations to work upon, and too much Fewel was thrown into the Fire of National Contention on both Sides.</P>
<P>In <HI>Scotland</HI> it was &s;aid the Court of <HI>England</HI> would protect them, and they would be pardon'd, <HI>only becau&s;e they were</HI> Scots-<HI>Men that were murdered;</HI> And the like.</P>
<P>In <HI>England</HI> it was &s;aid, the Rabble had cry'd out to hang them, be|cau&s;e they were <HI>Engli&s;h-men,</HI> that they had &s;aid they wi&s;ht they could hang the whole Nation &s;o, and that they in&s;ulted them as they went to Execution with the Name of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Dogs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Never was &s;uch an unfortunate Circum&s;tance to exa&s;perate the common People on both Sides, and to fill them with irreconcile|able <PB N="48" REF="83"><GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"><PB N="49" REF="84"><GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"><PB N="50" REF="85">
Aver&s;ions that might prepare them for Blood, and if in <HI>England</HI> it had gone a little higher, it would not have been &s;afe for a <HI>Scots</HI> Man to have walk't the Street.</P>
<P>Certain it is, that tho the Men had been innocent, <HI>for that was now alledged,</HI> yet as they were condemned by a due Cour&s;e of Law, Tryed and Executed by the common Form of Ju&s;tice in that Coun|try, and in the &s;ame manner by which their own Subjects were tryed and executed, the Fault mu&s;t ly in the Witne&s;&s;es and the Jury that believ'd them; But there could be no pretence to make it a National Quarrel at all.</P>
<P>That in <HI>England</HI> it had been but too frequent to Try and Con|demn innocent Men, and that if Evidences &s;wore the Fact, it might be the Misfortune of any innocent Man to fall under &s;uch a Di&s;a&s;t|er, the Crime lay in the Villany and Perjury of Witne&s;&s;es, but the Nation could not be quarrelled on that Account.</P>
<P>But &s;till the&s;e Things left a Corroded Ma&s;s of ill Blood in the Minds of the People on either Side, &amp; as Improved by the Malitious Fomenters of our Divi&s;ions, they were very Unhappy at that Time.</P>
<P>To Exa&s;perate the People yet more, it was reported, That Cap|tain <HI>Drummond</HI> was yet Living, that neither he, nor any of his Men was ever Touch't by <HI>Green</HI> or his Crew, and &s;ome Seamen who Landed in <HI>England,</HI> made <HI>Affidavit</HI> directly contrary to the Evidence that Hang'd them.</P>
<P>I &s;hall no further enter into the Merits of the Ca&s;e, than &s;erves to the matter of National Heats&mdash;; The Thing was Generally, thought to be a ha&s;ty Execution, but the Argument, That it ought to be no Ground of a National Quarrel, prevailed in <HI>England,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Pri&s;oners in <HI>Scotland</HI> were Reprived from Time to Time, and at la&s;t let go.</P>
<P>In both the&s;e Ca&s;es, the Mi&s;chiefs of Tumult and Rabbles is to be ob&s;erved, and how ea&s;ie it is to &s;et Nations on a flame, by the Violent Fomenting the Pa&s;&s;ions and Humours of the People, and how much tho&s;e &s;ort of Men are to be Dete&s;ted, who blow the Coals of Strife and Di&s;&s;ention in a Nation, prompt the Fury of an Enraged Multitude to Fly in one anothers Faces, and In&s;ult the Laws and Governments of both Countrys at once.</P>
<P>The End of this Account, is to make out what I at fir&s;t Noted, concerning the Cau&s;es which wrought the&s;e two Nations up to &s;uch a Nece&s;&s;ity of a Union, that either it mu&s;t have been a Union or a War, the Animo&s;ities on both Sides being rai&s;ed to &s;uch a pitch, that they could no longer have remained in the u&s;ual <HI>Me|dium</HI> of Peace&mdash;; Nor was this Unhappy Story, the lea&s;t cau&s;e of the growing Aver&s;ion between us, which was now come to a very great Hight.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Head, to which I a&s;cribe the growing Alienation be|tween the&s;e two Kingdoms, was the Act of Security in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>This Act made a great Noi&s;e in the World, and was magnified in <HI>England,</HI> to &s;uch a Hight, that it was look'd upon as in effect a Declaration of War, to Commence at the Queen's Demi&s;e, and
<PB N="51" REF="86">
however de&s;igned, was effectually made &s;o, by what after hap|pened.</P>
<P>The Marqui&s;s of <HI>Tweeddale</HI> was High Commi&s;&s;ioner to this Par|liament, a Per&s;on of Extraordinary Temper, Candor and Mo|de&s;ty&mdash;; The matter of the Succe&s;&s;ion had in the preceeding Parliament been rejected, on this Suppo&s;ition, That it was not Pru|dent for <HI>Scotland</HI> to Joyn with <HI>England,</HI> except &s;uch Conditions of Commerce and Navigation were fir&s;t obtained by Treaty with <HI>England,</HI> as were Ju&s;t and Honourable for <HI>Scotland,</HI> and abundance of Hone&s;t Gentlemen, who were far enough from &s;o much as being &s;u&s;pected of Favouring the Jacobite Intere&s;t, joyned together in this Demand; They were willing to come into the Succe&s;&s;ion, pro|vided they had &s;uch and &s;uch Conditions, as they thought were rea&s;onable to be in&s;i&s;ted on in behalf of <HI>Scotland,</HI> among which the Liberty and Freedom of Trade to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations was one&mdash;.</P>
<P>There were many very Learned Debates in the preceeding Par|liament upon this Head; Great and Popular Speeches made on the Subject&mdash;, and the Act of Security was offered, and Voted, but could not then be pa&s;t, for Things began to run high in the Parliament, which occa&s;ioned a Rece&s;s.</P>
<P>This was taken in <HI>England</HI> in a mo&s;t Hainous manner, and no|thing was now talked of there, but the <HI>Scots</HI> Buying Arms and Am|munition, Training and Exerci&s;ing their Men, and Mighty Things were &s;ugge&s;ted in <HI>England,</HI> which the <HI>Scots might do,</HI> and &s;ome|times which they <HI>would do;</HI> The Printed News Papers gave a mo&s;t Formidable Journal of the Duke of <HI>Athole</HI> drawing out his High|landers, Encamping three Days with Seven Thou&s;and Men, how Armed, how well Officer'd, and the like; Another Paper told the World of Sixty Thou&s;and Men in <HI>Scotland,</HI> Arm'd and Train'd, and ready to take the Field.</P>
<P>However ab&s;urd the&s;e Things were, and that Wi&s;er Men who knew the State of <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;aw there was nothing in it, but what every Nation in the World would have done in the like ca&s;e, that it was neither more nor le&s;s than Arming their Militia, and put|ting them into &s;ome Order, which, for &s;everal years pa&s;t had been intirely neglected, yet I &s;ay, However ab&s;urd the Sugge&s;tions were, they were Improved in <HI>England</HI> to all manner of Extremes, and &s;ome mo&s;t ridiculous Exce&s;&s;es were run into, both publick and private.</P>
<P>It is, no doubt, but as <HI>Scotland</HI> was acknowledged to be Inde|pendent, whatever the forward Pens of our Politicians would have pretended, yet I &s;ay, being acknowledged Independent even by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament, it was a very material Thing to have Her Concur in E&s;tabli&s;hing the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Crown, on the &s;ame Per&s;on, as <HI>England</HI> had done.</P>
<P>Two Things mov'd in this Affair on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Side.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Some would not have it done at all, and therefore were for Irritating the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Scots,</HI> that it might come to a Rupture in &s;tead of a Settlement, and this by putting it
<PB N="52" REF="87">
upon <HI>Scotland</HI> to Declare, without a previous Treaty, which they knew would never be accepted.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Others would gladly have had the <HI>Scots</HI> come into the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion, but were willing to have them do it without any Con|ditions, thinking that <HI>Scotland</HI> ought &s;till be kept Low, for fear of their Principles, which lead them to be no Friends to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Church E&s;tabli&s;hment.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Both the&s;e cried out, and Exclaim'd at this Act of Security, and repre&s;ented it to the World, as if the <HI>Scots</HI> were going actually to &s;eparate from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>There was one Clau&s;e in the Act of Security, which intirely Ex|cluded the Succe&s;&s;or to the Crown from Governing both Kingdoms together.</P>
<P>This the Enemies of <HI>Scotland</HI> pre&s;ently Repre&s;ented in <HI>England,</HI> as a De&s;ign to Re&s;tore King <HI>James,</HI> and a great many Hone&s;t People were brought in to believe, that the <HI>Scots</HI> even the Presbyterians them&s;elves, were &s;o alienated from <HI>England,</HI> and &s;o ob&s;tinately bent again&s;t joyning with her on any account, that they would ne|ver again be under the &s;ame Head, nay that they would rather League them&s;elves with <HI>France,</HI> and re&s;tore King <HI>James,</HI> than come to any Terms with her. And this was as it were confirmed when the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;ub&s;equent to the&s;e things pa&s;&s;ed an Act for Trading with <HI>France,</HI> tho' as their Circum&s;tances then &s;tood, it was very nece&s;&s;ary to them.</P>
<P>Nor was this run to any thing le&s;s in <HI>England,</HI> and they began to talk loudly there of <HI>forcing the</HI> Scots <HI>to the Succe&s;&s;ion;</HI> But this was by &s;uch as either coveted a Breach between the two Nations u|pon any Terms, or really did not under&s;tand what they &s;aid. The latter appeared by their printing &s;ome Pieces to prove the Right of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hannover</HI> to the Crown by Succe&s;&s;ion, a Thing all People that kno' any thing of the Affairs of <HI>Europe,</HI> kno' it was the Foun|dation upon which the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment pretends to be built&mdash;, But on that much &s;afer, and much more Divine Right of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution, and <HI>Scots</HI> al&s;o, I mean Parliamentary Limita|tion.</P>
<P>Things ran very high now in both Nations, the Mea&s;ures ta|ken in <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;eem'd to be very well grounded, and their Aim well taken, for either <HI>England</HI> mu&s;t comply with <HI>Scotland,</HI> as to &s;uch Treaties as were rea&s;onable, or el&s;e &s;he might have the Sati&s;|faction to &s;ee clearly <HI>Scotland</HI> by this Act was plac't in an intire &s;eparate State from her, who &s;he wou'd joyn with, what Prince &s;he wou'd bring in, where &s;he would be&s;tow her Crown, was not to the purpo&s;e; Two Things &s;he had made plain.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That &s;he was re&s;olved to have it wholly in her own Hands, to be&s;tow as &s;he thought fit.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That wherever the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Crown was be&s;towed, the <HI>Scots</HI> Crown &s;hould not without Conditions be obtain'd.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>This effectually Settled and Declar'd the Independency of <HI>Scot|land,</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="88">
and put her into a Po&s;ture fit to be treated with, either by <HI>England,</HI> or by any other Nation.</P>
<P>Nor did the Apprehen&s;ions which this gave the World of the <HI>Scots</HI> de&s;igning to re&s;tore King <HI>James</HI> do her any Di&s;&s;ervice, for tho' nothing is more certain than that the <HI>Jacobites as they are called,</HI> conceived great Hopes from the&s;e Things, and flattered them&s;elves exceedingly, that the Return of their King, <HI>as they called him,</HI> would be the Effect of all the&s;e Breaches; And therefore fell in heartily with all the&s;e Things, and as far as po&s;&s;ible carried on the A|ver&s;ion to a Settlement with <HI>England;</HI> Yet it is as certain, that the Gentlemen who mainly carried on this Project, had no more Eye that way than to the Great <HI>Turk,</HI> but were &s;incerely bent to the Pro&s;perity of their Country, and the E&s;tabli&s;hment both Religious and Civil, as fully appeared afterwards by their heartily pur&s;uing the Treaty that followed.</P>
<P>The Drift of the whole Matter was, the bringing <HI>England</HI> to Terms, bringing the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation to a Treaty, and tho' it is con|fe&s;t that the Pro&s;pect was Remote and Melancholly, <HI>England</HI> at the time being aver&s;e to any &s;uch thing; yet as the&s;e Gentlemen &s;aw there was no other way to redeem <HI>Scotland</HI> from the Di&s;courage|ment &s;he then lay under, with re&s;pect to the Ab&s;ence of her Court, the Dependance of her Gentry and Nobility, the Limitations and Re&s;trictions of Trade, which by the Act of Navigation &s;he was fet|tered with, and &s;everal Di&s;advantages her pre&s;ent Conjunction, <HI>which was made without any Treaty</HI> laid her under&mdash;, and therefore they &s;tood &s;trictly and re&s;olutely to their Mea&s;ures, and the more the Court in <HI>England</HI> pu&s;ht at her joyning in the Settlement, and u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible means to bring it to pa&s;s, the more aver&s;e they appeared, and the farther they went off from it.</P>
<P>Thus I &s;ay this Act of Security being only attempted in the fir&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, was perfected in the next, and every day fur|ther and further Advances were made &s;eemingly to an entire and la&s;ting Separation of the Kingdoms from one another.</P>
<P>There were other Steps made to this on both Sides as to Matters of Trade, as &s;hall appear immediately.</P>
<P><HI>England</HI> who was all this while under a very unhappy Conduct, and acted upon quite different Foundations, from what we have &s;een her happily brought over to &s;ince, took the wor&s;t Mea&s;ures upon the <HI>Scots</HI> Proceedings then, that ever a wi&s;e People could have taken; For the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament &s;itting &s;oon after, <HI>viz.</HI> 1704. the <HI>Scots</HI> Act of Security came to be con&s;idered, and however influenc't by a pre|cipitant Party, <HI>God only knows,</HI> they pa&s;t an Act in my Opinion the mo&s;t Impolitick, I had almo&s;t &s;aid unju&s;t, that ever pa&s;t that great A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>This was that Act of Parliament, Intituled, <HI>An Act to prevent the Mi&s;chiefs ari&s;ing to</HI> England <HI>from the Act of Security in</HI> Scotland. In which they in a manner declar'd open War with <HI>Scotland,</HI> unle&s;s by the 24th of <HI>Decemb.</HI> the next year they &s;hould &s;ettle the Crown in the
<PB N="54" REF="89">
&s;ame Per&s;on as now &s;ettled in <HI>England</HI>&mdash;; For they appointed 24 Men of War to be fitted out, to prevent the <HI>Scots</HI> Trading with <HI>France,</HI> declared the <HI>Scots</HI> in <HI>England</HI> Aliens, and &s;everal other Ar|ticles, as in the Act it &s;elf may more at large appear.</P>
<P>This was done in that famous Parliament, called, <HI>The Tacking Parliament,</HI> and it was the le&s;s to be wondred at, Becau&s;e, <HI>which is the Subject I am at pre&s;ent upon,</HI> the Heats between the Nations, which were at this time improv'd by the Parties on both Sides, were ri&s;en to a very great Hight, all things tended to Exa&s;perations and Provocations, no Man of Temper &s;eemed to &s;how him&s;elf on either Hand, and tho&s;e who bore the lea&s;t Regard to the general Good of both Kingdoms, fore&s;aw nothing but an unavoidable War between us; And indeed had Matters &s;tood thus but a very little longer, it had been impo&s;&s;ible to have avoided it, and that in a mo&s;t un&s;ea&s;on|able time for <HI>Europe,</HI> which was then engaged in the mo&s;t furious and mo&s;t critical Juncture of the War with <HI>France,</HI> being the year before the Battle at <HI>Blenheim.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the Party in <HI>Scotland</HI> who had laid their Scheme, in hopes that <HI>England</HI> would have come into Mea&s;ures for the general Good, &s;aw them&s;elves di&s;appointed; and tho' its true, that had <HI>England</HI> then &s;een with the Eyes of her National Under&s;tanding, and had &s;he not been ridden by a Party who openly pur&s;ued the Ruine of her ve|ry Con&s;titution, I mean as e&s;tabli&s;h't on the Revolution Principle, I &s;ay, had &s;he not been under that unhappy Influence, &s;he had taken other Mea&s;ures, yet as it was, nothing was to be expected.</P>
<P>However, the Gentlemen in <HI>Scotland</HI> happily re&s;olved to wait for the I&s;&s;ue of Things, and firmly adhered to their new Scheme; <HI>Scotland</HI> began to be talk'd up in the World a little, and the&s;e very Enemies who, <HI>as they thought,</HI> wounded her by talking up the mighty formidable Things this Act of Security might produce, really rai&s;|ed her Reputation; nothing was more ab&s;urd, than their allarming <HI>England</HI> at the <HI>Chimeras</HI> of their own Heads, &s;uch as <HI>Scotlands</HI> buying 30000 &s;tand of Arms in <HI>Holland,</HI> laying in 10000 Barrels of Pow|der, arming 60000 Men, and the like, all which in Reality was no|thing at all but mu&s;tering their Train'd-bands, <HI>as they call them in</HI> England, and buying about 500 Barrels of Powder for the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> In their allarming <HI>England</HI> I &s;ay, at the&s;e mighty things, they really rai&s;ed the Reputation of <HI>Scotland</HI> in the World, and made her begin to make a different Figure in the Eyes of other Nati|ons, and there is no doubt had things gone on to a Rupture, as wic|ked Men on both Sides wi&s;hed, and good Men began to fear, <HI>Scot|land</HI> might have found &s;ome powerful Princes willing to have accep|ted her Crown, and to have in the mean time Supported, Supplyed and Encourag'd her to &s;tand upon her own Feet.</P>
<P>But I'll do the Gentlemen who Managed this Affair, this Ju&s;tice, that I believe they had it not at all in their De&s;ign, to fly to the Protection of any Foreign Power, no not to any Prote&s;tant Power
<PB N="55" REF="90">
in <HI>Europe,</HI> unle&s;s Forc'd to it by the precipitant Mea&s;ures <HI>England</HI> was then in all probability going into; and if they had done it then, I can not &s;ee how they could have been blam'd&mdash;. But as to the pre&s;ent State of Things, the Gentlemen who Managed this Part, &s;eem'd to me, always to aim at obliging <HI>England</HI> to give them good Terms, and to put them&s;elves in &s;uch a Po&s;ture in the World, as &s;hould make <HI>England</HI> &s;ee, it was worth their while to do &s;o, as well as that they ought to do &s;o; And this was &s;o ju&s;t a Step, and the Aim &s;o well taken, as by the Con&s;equence appeared, that I think, 'tis the greate&s;t Panegyrick that can be made on tho&s;e Gentlemen, to &s;ay, They brought to pa&s;s by it, all the great Things which GOD in his Providence has thought fit to do towards our Peace and Happine&s;s in this I&s;land.</P>
<P>If they did not de&s;ign this, or had not this Hone&s;t Aim in View, they le&s;s de&s;erve the Prai&s;e; but it is evident, Providence made their Mea&s;ures In&s;trumental to bring it to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus &s;tood the Affairs of this I&s;land, at the End of the Year 1705, when the Aver&s;ions between the two Kingdoms, by the &s;everal Steps I have noticed, was come to a great Hight, the People &s;eem'd Ex|a&s;perated again&s;t one another to the highe&s;t Degree, the Governments &s;eem'd bent to act Counter to one another in all their Councils; Trade Cla&s;h't between them in all its Circum&s;tances, and every Par|liament run further and further into the mo&s;t di&s;obliging Things that could be: <HI>England</HI> laid a new Impo&s;t upon <HI>Scots</HI> Cloth; <HI>Scotland</HI> Prohibited all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Woollen Manufacture in General, and Erected Manufacturies among them&s;elves, which, had they been prudently Managed too, might have been very Advantageous to them; But, <HI>of that by the way. Scotland</HI> freely and openly Ex|ported their Wool to <HI>France, Germany</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> to the irre|parable Lo&s;s of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufactures, having great Quantities of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Wool brought into <HI>Scotland</HI> over the Borders, which, it was impo&s;&s;ible for <HI>England</HI> to prevent; So that the Famous Trade for Wool to <HI>France</HI> by <HI>Rumney Mar&s;h, commonly called Owling,</HI> was intirely Dropt, and <HI>France</HI> not Supplyed only, but Glutted with Wool.</P>
<P>On the other hand, <HI>England</HI> was proceeding to Prohibite the Importation of <HI>Scots</HI> Cattel, and to interrupt by Force their Trade with <HI>France,</HI> and had this la&s;t proceeded to Practice, all the World could not have prevented a War between both Nations.</P>
<P>But more prudent Coun&s;els prevailed, and GOD's Providence Unravelled all the&s;e Schemes of De&s;truction, which mad Men had drawn for the Ruine of their Native Country; And as many times Things evil in their De&s;ign, are Over-ruled by an Invi&s;ible Hand, and bring to pa&s;s that very Good, which they were prepar'd to De|&s;troy; Even &s;o it was here, for the&s;e Confu&s;ions were the very Things that brought both the Nations to their Sen&s;es, I mean, brought them both to better Temper&mdash;; The con&s;equences of a Bloody War ju&s;t breaking out in the Bowels of their Native Coun|trey, in the Ruine and certain De&s;olation of which they mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily

have a great Share, opened the Eyes of the mo&s;t thinking People on both Sides, even of tho&s;e who in them&s;elves had no real inclination to the Conjunction of the Kingdoms, and thus the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of taking new Mea&s;ures began to appear both ways.</P>
<P>In <HI>England,</HI> the Weight of the pre&s;ent War which every Day rather Increa&s;ed than Decrea&s;ed; In <HI>Scotland,</HI> their declining Con|dition and Di&s;united Circum&s;tances; in <HI>England,</HI> the matter of Se|curity in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the pro&s;pect of Advantage, all concurred to &s;way the Inclinations of Wi&s;e-men to heal the&s;e Breaches.</P>
<P>I have now &s;hown by what Steps the&s;e two Nations were brought to the very Brink of mutual De&s;truction, and the Sequel of the Story will tell any body, who were the Parties that prompted both Nations to the&s;e Unhappy Extremes: I &s;hall in the next place a little Examine how all this Tide of Mi&s;chief and Folly turned, and how they began to come to them&s;elves in both Kingdoms, and this will &s;o naturally lead us to the Hi&s;tory of the Union, that I can not think of a more proper Introduction.</P>
<P>The Party in <HI>England</HI> who had the Reins of the Admini&s;tration in their Hands, had given other Te&s;timonies than this of their precipitant Mea&s;ures, and as they had made not this Nation only Unea&s;ie, but their own too, &s;o as Things Generally take new Turns, when they come to Extremes, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation began to be Allarm'd at the Proceedings, as tending to the Subver&s;ion of all the Fabrick of Government erected by the Revolution.</P>
<P>The occa&s;ion of all this, is too long to relate here, and the Hi&s;tory of the Tacking the Occa&s;ional-Bill to the Money-Bill in that Par|liament in <HI>England,</HI> is too well known, to need any Recital. It is enough to &s;ay here, That pu&s;hing at &s;uch Hot Mea&s;ures in <HI>England,</HI> as is u&s;ual in all Precipitations, like an Ax &s;truck upon a hard Stone, the Blow rebounded, and the Weapon flew out of the Hand of the Unskilful Workman&mdash;; the Project fail'd, the Party Overthrew them&s;elves, and never Recover'd.</P>
<P>The Queen, far from approving the Extravagancies they were running Things to, and awakned by the Danger of her Peoples Li|berties, which were as dear to her &s;elf as to them, finding to what Mi&s;chiefs the&s;e Warm Gentlemen were leading her, and being by the goodne&s;s of her Di&s;po&s;ition, as well as Experience in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Affairs, particularly Aver&s;e to Things Hard or Severe upon her People, much more &s;o to all manner of illegal Severities&mdash;, put a full &s;top to this Career of Mi&s;chief&mdash;. And tho' indeed they had brought Things to the very Edge of De&s;truction both in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> on their own Bu&s;ine&s;s, as well as in the Affairs of the two Kingdoms, yet the Queen immediately &s;hifting Hands, and Ap|plying with her u&s;ual Wi&s;dom, to the E&s;tabli&s;hing the Minds of her People, Retriv'd this whole Affair, re&s;tor'd <HI>England</HI> to the Tranquillity &s;o much de&s;ired, filled up her Mini&s;try, and all Offices of Tru&s;t, with Men of the &s;ame Candor and Moderation with her &s;elf, openly Abandoned and Di&s;couraged the Mea&s;ures of tho&s;e People, who had run Things to &s;uch Exce&s;&s;es, and Re-&s;ettled the
<PB N="57" REF="92">
Minds of her People, Di&s;tracted with Apprehen&s;ions of Ruine and Party-Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Thus the Mini&s;try in <HI>England</HI> was intirely Changed, the Lord Keeper, Sir <HI>Nathan Wright</HI> Depo&s;ed, Sir <HI>Edward Seymour</HI> Compt|roller of the Hou&s;hold put out of Her Family, the Earl of <HI>Not|tinghame</HI> Secretary of State, and &s;everal others laid a&s;ide; the Props of the High-flying Party, <HI>as they were called,</HI> were left out of the Council, and removed from their Places in the Government.</P>
<P>In the &s;everal Countries, the Peoples Approbation of Her Maje&s;ties Proceedings, and their Joy at this Change of In&s;truments, was te&s;ti|fied by the Univer&s;al Contempt put upon the Affair of the Tacking; and of the Occa&s;ional-Bill, as well as of all Hot Men and Hot-Mea&s;ures; and this te&s;tified by the Change in their Elections of Parliament-men, a new Parliament being then to be Cho&s;en, in which &s;o General an Aver&s;ion to the Occa&s;ional-Bill, or any thing Invading the Toleration, and particularly to the Affair of the Tack appeared, that in &s;pight of all Oppo&s;itions a great number of the Tacking Members were thrown out, and &s;uch a Change of Men appeared in the next Parliament, that whereas in the other Parlia|ment, the High-Party had a Majority of Sixty Two or there about, for every Thing they joyn'd in; On the fir&s;t Tryal of the Strength of the Hou&s;e, which was perhaps the Greate&s;t that has been known of late Years, it appear'd the Whig-Party had the Majority by above Seventy Voices, and the&s;e by the turning out &s;everals on the Trials of Elections, and other Circum&s;tances, ro&s;e up to be above a Hundred, tho' after they &s;eem'd to lo&s;e &s;ome Ground again, but it did not la&s;t.</P>
<P>Things being thus happily turned in <HI>England,</HI> and the fir&s;t Step for the E&s;tabli&s;hing and Settling this new Party in their Seats of Management taken, it was wonderful to &s;ee the Change it made in all the Affairs of the Nation, how every Thing &s;ucceeded, unheard of Victories Abroad, unu&s;ual Chearfulne&s;s at Home, and a new Face of Pro&s;perity &s;eem'd to Guild the Affairs of the Nation, the Feuds of Parties died in every place; Peace, Union, and Temper began to be the Companion of every Society, and the Ancient Animo&s;ities between Neighbour and Neighbour, between Friend and Friend, which formerly crept, <HI>not into Society only,</HI> but even into our Families, and our very Beds, declined a pace; The Queen Encouraged Peace and Love, and Unity among her People, and pre&s;&s;ed the Nation to it upon all Occa&s;ions, and all Good Men began to Encourage it by their Examples.</P>
<P>In this General Felicity of Affairs in <HI>England, Scotland</HI> came into Remembrance; Her Maje&s;ty as having an equal Regard to the Good of all Her Subjects, and as being ju&s;tly Concerned, not for the Change of the Temper and Condition of Her People only, but for the Continuance of it to them in Ages to come, could not but be Solicitous for the removing the Ob&s;tructions which lay in the way on either Side.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="93">
When the Wi&s;e&s;t Heads in both Nations had been Con&s;ulted with on this Article, tho' Opinions differ'd, yet no <HI>Medium</HI> could ever be found &s;o Effectual to &s;ecure this Peace, and remove all po&s;&s;ibility of a Fracture, like renewing the Treaty of Union.</P>
<P>And thus I am brought down to the General Article of the Trea|ty, by the meer Threed of the Story, the Feuds of Parties, the Folly of State&s;men, the Fury of Rabbles, and the General Revi|ving of the old Animo&s;ities between the People, had been Screwed up to a dangerous Hight, as is Noted already, by that very Party, who had on all Occa&s;ions, &s;hown them&s;elves Enemies to the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment, and future Peace even of both Nations, and by this Method, they thought they had rendred the Succe&s;&s;ion to both Crowns Impracticable for the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hannover,</HI> and &s;ecured an inevitable Rupture between the Nations, when ever it &s;hould plea&s;e GOD to Remove Her Maje&s;ty out of this World.</P>
<P>But great are the Wonders of In&s;crutable Providence, the&s;e very Schemes contrived in the Deeps of Infernal Malice, Brooded on by that Party who ever Envied the Liberty of Prote&s;tants, and the Tranquility as well as Privileges Enjoy'd by the People of this whole I&s;land, and Hatch'd by the warm Influence of a reigning Party, by which they Flattered them&s;elves, They had effectually Overthrown the Project of a Union of the Kingdoms, made their Coalition Impo&s;&s;ible, and all Schemes projected for it Impracti|cable; I &s;ay, the&s;e very Things made way for that &s;ame Union, they were Calculated to De&s;troy.</P>
<P>The Hight tho&s;e Mea&s;ures I have been &s;peaking of, was brought to, made, as it were, a Force upon both Nations to come to this Treaty.</P>
<P>It was now but a few Months to come, when the Nations mu&s;t di|rectly fall out, <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men of War mu&s;t be fitted out to crui&s;e upon the <HI>Scots,</HI> and we that con&s;ented, or at lea&s;t did not &s;cruple to have the <HI>Dutch</HI> carry on a free Trade with <HI>France,</HI> mu&s;t go &amp; fight with our own Brethren for it&mdash;; Whereas, had we been in our Trading Sen|&s;es, we would have done it our &s;elves.</P>
<P>The Cri&s;is things were come to now, was &s;uch, that they could no longer &s;tand at a Stay, but we mu&s;t fall out with the <HI>Scots,</HI> or unite with them, all Methods to bring them to &s;ettle the Succe&s;&s;ion without a Treaty had been in vain u&s;ed by the Party before, who would gladly have Tricked them into it, but the <HI>Scots</HI> were too wi&s;e to fall into that Snare.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Mini&s;try were for fairer Dealings with them at the &s;ame time, wi&s;ely concluding, that to gain of the <HI>Scots</HI> what they ought to grant, it was rea&s;onable to grant to the <HI>Scots</HI> what they ought to have&mdash;, and that a Treaty with them might be made ef|fectual, the only way was to &s;et about it, upon an hone&s;t Foot, and then pur&s;ue it &s;incerely, and not upon Sharping and Tricking on either Side as before.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="94">
But there yet &s;eemed to ly one invincible Ob&s;truction in the way of this Treaty, and that was the Act of Parliament pa&s;&s;ed in <HI>England</HI> the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion, which, as before noted, had declared a kind of War again&s;t the <HI>Scots,</HI> in ca&s;e they did not come into the Succe&s;&s;ion by &s;uch a Day; And upon the fir&s;t Motion to a Treaty, the <HI>Scots</HI> de|clared they could not enter into any Treaty with <HI>England,</HI> till that Act was Repealed.</P>
<P>This had indeed a great deal of Rea&s;on in it, and &s;uch as could not be with&s;tood, for the Honour of the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;eemed very much impaired in that Act, and that they could not come to a Treaty u|pon equal Terms while &s;uch a Law &s;tood in force upon them, which &s;eem'd as if it had been a Sword over their Heads drawn to awe them into a Treaty.</P>
<P>The Queen, who was re&s;olved if po&s;&s;ible to bring this great Event to pa&s;s, and who &s;trove to do it &s;o, as might give all Her Subjects Satisfaction, undertook to clear up this Difficulty, and at the next Parliament which met in <HI>England, Octob.</HI> 23. 1706, in Her Speech to both Hou&s;es, Recommended the taking away of this Ob&s;truction, by Repealing that Act, in order to introduce a Treaty of Union, which Her Maje&s;ty &s;aw now more clearly in view than ever be|fore.</P>
<P>I know there were &s;trong Struggles in <HI>England</HI> again&s;t Repealing this Act, and that chiefly without Doors, the Party fore&s;eeing, that if this Step was taken in Parliament, the Union which they really dreaded would of cour&s;e come upon the Stage, to this end it was re|pre&s;ented as Di&s;honourable to make &s;uch an Advance to the <HI>Scots:</HI> That it was an In&s;ulting of <HI>England</HI> to have the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;ay, they would not Treat with her till &s;uch and &s;uch Conditions were per|formed&mdash;; That this was letting the <HI>Scots</HI> pre&s;cribe Prelimi|naries upon <HI>England,</HI> and if <HI>England</HI> complyed, it would make them more Encroaching.</P>
<P>But the Temper in the Parliament was quite different from this, it was plain there that the <HI>Scots</HI> were in the Right to a&s;k this as a Preliminary, that the Treaty would for ever be &s;ubject to this Ob|jection, that it was not free, but done under the Terror or Force of that Act of Parliament, that as it was not Honourable for the <HI>Scots</HI> to have a Treaty forced upon them under &s;uch Circum&s;tances; So neither was it Honourable for <HI>England</HI> to force a Treaty upon them, that the Act was unrea&s;onable in its own Nature, that <HI>En|gland</HI> could have no pretence but meer Violence to intermeddle with the <HI>Scots</HI> Commerce, who were a free Nation, and ought to be at Liberty to Trade with any Nation that they thought fit to Trade with, that their Trade with <HI>France</HI> was done by their own Act of Parliament pa&s;&s;ed by the Queen, and was not incon&s;i&s;tent with, or contraveening any Treaty or Contract with <HI>England,</HI> that <HI>Scotland</HI> was under no Treaty of Commerce, or under no Ob|ligation to Trade, or not to Trade as <HI>England</HI> did; That as to the Confederacy, and the War in which they were embark't with <HI>Eng|gland,</HI>
<PB N="60" REF="95">
that laid them under no Obligation, &s;ince the <HI>Dutch</HI> were in the &s;ame Confederacy, and yet openly proclaimed a free Trade with <HI>France;</HI> Nor did the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> pretend to ob&s;truct them in it; That <HI>Scotland</HI> was as Independent of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government as the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and ought to be at liberty to Trade unmole&s;ted as well as they.</P>
<P>The&s;e Arguments back't with an Admini&s;tration of Government now quite recovered from the Tyrannical Principles of tho&s;e former|ly in Power, &s;oon influenc't the Parliament to Repeal the Act, and take this Step by way of advance to the Scots, by which they let the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;ee they were in the hands of their Friends, that now they might expect fair Dealings, and had Room to Treat with Freedom and Honour.</P>
<P>This was a great Mortification to tho&s;e Gentlemen who had pro|moted that Act, who now together with their whole Party, &s;et them|&s;elves with all their Artifice to oppo&s;e the Treaty in all its Parts in both Kingdoms; to rai&s;e Scruples, imprint Jealou&s;ies, Mi&s;repre&s;ent Per&s;ons and Things, embroil Councils, rai&s;e Scandals, and in &s;hort to do every manner of thing they could to embarra&s;s and ob&s;truct the Treaty: And in the fir&s;t place to prejudice the Minds of the com|mon People again&s;t the Union as &s;uch.

<P>I have already related the I&s;&s;ue of the Treaty begun the fir&s;t Year of the Queen, and made my Ob&s;ervations of the Rea&s;on of its Mi&s;|carriage: It may be ob&s;erved, That Her Maje&s;ty under&s;tanding the true Rea&s;ons of the Di&s;appointment, which 'twas thought lay in the Per&s;ons Treating, particularly on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Side, who&s;e Di&s;po&s;ition to fini&s;h it for the Publick Good, it was &s;uppo&s;ed, did not appear at all to Her Satisfaction, <HI>in which I have further already Explain'd my &s;elf,</HI> Obtain'd a New Act of Parliament in <HI>England,</HI> and the like in <HI>Scotland,</HI> Impowering the Queen to Appoint Commi&s;&s;ioners on ei|ther Hand, to Treat of an Union between the Two Nations.&mdash;</P>

<P>There was a Party in both Kingdoms, but mo&s;t Powerful in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who&s;e De&s;ign was principally and directly again&s;t the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion as &s;uch; The&s;e we mu&s;t allow to be &s;etting every Wheel at Work, and Acting with all their Power and Policy again&s;t every thing which look'd that way.</P></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>When they &s;aw it convenient, they acted again&s;t an Union in its general Term, and frequently &s;ome of the le&s;s Politick of that Par|ty let fall the Excre&s;cence of their Principles in direct Terms, and Pamphlets were wrote upon that Scheme, &s;uch as one &s;hewing the Nece&s;&s;ities of a War with <HI>England, &amp;c,</HI> another &s;howing the Ad|vantages of an Union with other Nations, and <HI>France</HI> in particu|lar; others argued continually the mighty Terms, and the Advan|tages of Commerce <HI>Scotland</HI> might obtain from <HI>France,</HI> and not only propo&s;ed them as Equivalent to the Trade with <HI>England,</HI> but run on to &s;uch weak Extremes, as to &s;ay, that <HI>Scotland</HI> made no Advantage of her Commerce with <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But the&s;e may well be &s;aid to be the le&s;s Politick Part of the&s;e Gentlemen who were in the De&s;ign above, for they lo&s;t Ground even again&s;t the Union it &s;elf by it; and when the Committee of Parliament, Appointed to Examine the Exports and Imports, Re|ported, That <HI>Scotland</HI> Exported to <HI>England</HI> above 200000 Pounds
<PB N="3" REF="98">
<HI>Sterling per Annum</HI> in Linen, Cattel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Imports from thence appear'd &s;o &s;mall, that the Objectors dropp'd their Arguments upon that Head, and learn'd to talk with more Caution.</P>
<P>But the more Subtile Managers of this De&s;ign again&s;t the Succe&s;&s;i|on, went on by different Mea&s;ures, and with great Policy they acted every Party, as far as they thought they could be brought in to be &s;ub&s;ervient to their De&s;ign.</P>
<P>Thus fir&s;t &s;eeming to quit their direct Oppo&s;ition to the Succe&s;&s;i|on, as a Thing too open, and too much Cla&s;hing with the Temper of the Time, they fall in with that Party, who were for the Succe&s;|&s;ion with Limitations; Not that they wou'd have concurr'd with the Event, had the&s;e Limitations been never &s;o great, but that, in their Debating the Limitations, they might find Room to Clog the Succe&s;&s;ion it &s;elf, in &s;uch manner as the other Party could by no Means accept of it.</P>
<P>From the &s;ame Principle proceeded that Famous Re&s;olve in their Act of Security, by which the Succe&s;&s;ion met with two Invincible Ob&s;tacles, from whence they knew, &s;ome time or other, new Di&s;|putes mu&s;t ari&s;e, 1. That no Succe&s;&s;or at all &s;hould be Named, till after the Queen. 2. That when it was Named, it &s;hould be with this Limitation, that it &s;hould not be the &s;ame that &s;hould Succeed to the Kingdom of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>This was a Ma&s;ter-Piece of Policy, and had the mo&s;t Specious Pretence in the World, <HI>viz.</HI> The Hard&s;hips which <HI>Scotland</HI> had &s;uffered under the Influence of <HI>England</HI> in Matters of Commerce and Sovereignty; and therefore it was added immediately upon the &s;aid Clau&s;e, <HI>&V;nle&s;s that in this Pre&s;ent Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, or any other Se&s;&s;ion of this, or any en&s;uing Parliament, there be &s;uch Conditions of Government Settled and Enacted, as may Secure the Honour and So|vereignty of this Crown and Kingdom, the Freedom, Frequency and Power of Parliament, the Religion, Liberty and Trade of the Nation from</HI> Engli&s;h, <HI>or any Forreign Influence.</HI> See the Act of Security Print|ed in the <HI>Appendix</HI> to this Work, <HI>N^o.</HI> (1)</P>
<P>The running things to this Height in <HI>Scotland,</HI> put every Parties Mea&s;ures to a full Stop; The Gentlemen who were again&s;t the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion in general, and of whom I am now Treating, had mo&s;t ef|fectually carryed their Point; for as they pre&s;umed <HI>England</HI> could never come in to &s;uch a Treaty as they demanded, &s;o they had effec|tually foreclo&s;ed the Succe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Hannover,</HI> by Determining, that the Succe&s;&s;or of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould not be the &s;ame.</P>
<P>And 'tis remarkable to note here, how univer&s;ally all tho&s;e Gentle|men, who&s;e Aim was, <HI>Again&s;t</HI> the Succe&s;&s;ion, fell in with tho&s;e who&s;e De&s;ign was only to have Advantageous Terms from <HI>England</HI> for it.</P>
<P>But this very Point gain'd, brought about the main Work, and the Contraries that concurr'd in this Act, tho' from Cla&s;hing In|tere&s;ts, by the &s;trange Circulation of Cau&s;es, work'd all together into another Extreme, which none of them de&s;ign'd, and that was the Union.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="99">
Upon the pa&s;&s;ing the Act of Security, <HI>England</HI> grew very unea&s;y, and not to mention the common Apprehen&s;ions of the People, nor how, and by whom they were encrea&s;ed and fomented, the Act of Parliament pa&s;t, Intituled, <HI>An Act to prevent the Dangers ari&s;ing from the Act of Security in</HI> Scotland, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is a Demon&s;tration of what the Tendency of the&s;e Things would be; For this Act, which I have al&s;o, for the better under&s;tanding of the Story, Abridg'd and Printed in the <HI>Appendix, N^o.</HI> (2.) brought both Nations under the Nece&s;&s;ity of a War by the <HI>Chri&s;tma&s;s</HI> following; the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> being then obliged to fit out a Fleet, to interrupt the <HI>Scots</HI> Commerce, if their Act of Security was not Repealed.</P>
<P>Things being brought to this Extremity, the only Remedy that tho&s;e who wi&s;hed well to both Nations could contrive, was to re|vive a Treaty of Union, and &s;et heartily about it,&mdash;and the fir&s;t Step the Queen took towards it, was to propo&s;e it to the <HI>Scots</HI> Parliament, who Voted,&mdash;<HI>That they could enter into no Treaty of &V;nion, till that Act of Parliament mentioned above was Repealed in</HI> England.</P>
<P>Tho' this was a very bold Re&s;olve, yet the Queen, who &s;aw &s;ome Rea&s;onablene&s;s in it, managed Things with &s;o much Wi&s;dom and Moderation; and the Parliament, who &s;aw with differing Eyes from the other, and was of a quite differing Temper, found &s;ome|thing &s;o &s;evere and &s;o hard upon <HI>Scotland</HI> in that Act of Parlia|ment, that they made no Difficulty to make that Step in Advance to <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this Foot turn'd the fir&s;t Appearance of the Union; Now let us &s;ee how the Parties managed them&s;elves on all &s;ides.</P>
<P>The Inclination on both &s;ides to an Union, <HI>however afterwards manag'd,</HI> &s;eem'd &s;o univer&s;al, That the Party I am &s;peaking of, thought it was not proper to appear again&s;t it directly; but acting &s;till under Di&s;gui&s;e, they puzzle the Cau&s;e, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> With the wild Debate of a Federal Union, or an Union Partial and Imperfect;&mdash;and thus they fell in with the Party who were for the Union, not that they had the Union in their De&s;ign; but becau&s;e they thought the Thing Impracticable in it &s;elf; That it would make the People Sceptick in Government; and that &s;o it would certainly mi&s;carry, and the Succe&s;&s;ion would be lo&s;t that way.</P>
<P>Accordingly the Limitations were by &s;ecret Influence oppo&s;ed, and the Scheme of Succe&s;&s;ion laid a&s;ide to go upon the <HI>Chimera</HI> of an Union, <HI>as they thought it to be;</HI> and I could be very Merry with &s;ome Gentlemen here, upon the Banters and Je&s;ts they always Treated the Scheme of an Union with, as a Thing they little thought would ever be licked into any Shape, or ever obtain up|on the Nations to pa&s;s into a Law.</P>
<P>Thus I have brought the remote&s;t Party, who were downright Enemies of the Union, to fall into it;&mdash;From whence, let their De&s;ign be what it will, I mu&s;t tell them, they did it this Service, that it made the Union <HI>very Popular,</HI> however it came to be otherways afterward.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="100">
I come next to the Difficulty about Nobility, and this work'd in to an Union, by, as it were a Natural Con&s;equence; For the Antient Nobility finding their Sway with the People le&s;&s;en'd, and their Power, as well as their Honour, eclips'd, by the Crown day|ly Creating Numbers of what <HI>they</HI> called Up&s;tart Lords, were ea|&s;ily engaged in Limitations, to prevent their Future Monarch's en|crea&s;ing the Numbers of their Rank, to the Diminution, as they took it, of the Antient Families.</P>
<P>But when they came to con&s;ider the Scheme of Di&s;tinction made for the Repre&s;enting the Nobility in a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, they were the more ea&s;ily brought into the Union, as an effectual Step to prevent the Reducing their Honour, by Multiplying their Num|bers, and as a thing which would &s;eem to di&s;tingui&s;h them from &s;uch of the Modern Nobility, which they reckon'd already a Burthen to them.</P>
<P>Next, among the <HI>Whig</HI> Intere&s;t, and who were really Hone&s;t in their De&s;igns for the General Good, were yet two Parties.</P>
<P>One Party, without Reflection on any, had taken a ju&s;t Umbrage at the Growing Power of a certain Great Man; and as they had Rea&s;on to Ward off Per&s;onal Re&s;entments, in ca&s;e their Figure was dimini&s;hed; and having their true Intere&s;t in View, together with the Publick Good, e&s;teem'd it their Good Fortune, to have them both &s;tand upon one Bottom;&mdash;And the&s;e Gentlemen came hear|tily and hone&s;tly into the Mea&s;ures of the Union.</P>
<P>Another Party were for the Succe&s;&s;ion <HI>Limited, &amp;c.</HI> but not for the Union; The&s;e brought the former fir&s;t to them, thinking they would rather be for the Succe&s;&s;ion, and lay by the Thoughts of the Union; but finding them intirely for the Union, they fell in together.</P>
<P>The View of the Court in <HI>England</HI> was plain, <HI>viz. For the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion at any Rate;</HI> and therefore, till this Juncture, they had E&s;pou&s;ed that Party in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who were for the Succe&s;&s;ion, tho' with Limitations; and this the more ea&s;ily brought tho&s;e Gentle|men into the Union, &s;ince there they &s;ecured the Succe&s;&s;ion, and had the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Limitations Confirm'd, which they knew and ac|knowledg'd were better than their own.</P>
<P>Thus the two <HI>Whig</HI> Parties joyn'd, and the Duke of <HI>Queensberry,</HI> who had, in Concert with Her Maje&s;ty and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court, re|moved all the &s;eeming Difficulties on the part of <HI>Scotland,</HI> appearing publickly for it, the Union, as I have already noted, grew very Popular, the Court and the <HI>Whig</HI> Lords concurr'd in the General Good, the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Intere&s;t were abandon'd, and the Union grew up between all the Extremes as a Con&s;equence; and it was meer|ly Formed by the Nature of Things, rather than by the De&s;igns of the Parties.</P>
<P>Things being brought to this Pa&s;s, the Acts of Parliament pa&s;&s;ed, and the Queen Impowered to Name Commi&s;&s;ioners; I &s;hall pur|&s;ue the Proceedings in Order as they ly before me, and make the needful Ob&s;ervations as I go.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="101">
The re&s;pective Acts of Parliament for this Nomination, as ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to the better under&s;tanding of the Ca&s;e, and laying a Regular Scheme of the whole Matter before the Eye of the Read|er, I have annexed in the Collection herewith marked.</P>
<P>They that had &s;o wi&s;ely contrived the Beginning of this Work, could not be at a Lo&s;s to find out proper Per&s;ons for the Managing the Treaty in both Kingdoms; And therefore it was not long be|fore Her Maje&s;ty Named the Commi&s;&s;ioners for both Kingdoms, who&s;e Names we &s;hall pre&s;ently come to.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not de&s;cend to Encomiums on the Per&s;ons of the Treaters; For I am not about to write Panegyricks here, but an Impartial and Unbya&s;t Hi&s;tory of Fact. But &s;ince the Gentlemen have been ill treated, e&s;pecially in <HI>Scotland,</HI> upon this very Head, Charg'd with &s;trange Things, and Expo&s;ed in Print by &s;ome, who had no|thing but their Aver&s;ion to the Treaty to move them to Maletreat them: I mu&s;t be allowed, on all Occa&s;ions, to do them Ju&s;tice in the Proce&s;s of this Story.&mdash;And as I mu&s;t owne, That, generally &s;peaking, they were Per&s;ons of the greate&s;t Probity, the be&s;t Cha|racters, and the &s;teadie&s;t Adherence to the true Intere&s;t of their Countrey; &s;o, their Abilities will appear in every Step taken in &s;o great a Work, the bringing it to &s;o &s;hort a Con|clu&s;ion, and that, in &s;o little Time, the Reducing it to &s;o Conci&s;e a Form, and &s;o Fixing it, That, when all the Ob&s;truction imagi|nable was made to it afterward in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Mountains of Objection, which at fir&s;t Amu&s;ed the World proved &s;uch Mole-hills, were &s;o ea&s;ily Removed, Rai&s;ed &s;o much Noi&s;e, and Amounted to &s;o little in Sub&s;tance, That, after all was granted, that in Rea&s;on could be Demanded, the Amendments were &s;o few, and of &s;o little Weight, that there was not one Thing Material e|nough, to obtain a Negative in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament.</P>
<P>I cannot but note here, That even tho&s;e Amendments were not made, by Rea&s;on of any Omi&s;&s;ion in the Treaters; But the Parliament found the Oppo&s;ing Party to the Succe&s;&s;ion had two Handles to lay hold on in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and therefore in Prudence gave way to &s;uch Amendments, as they had the lea&s;t Rea&s;on to Ju&s;tify; The&s;e two Heads, which I call Handles again&s;t the Succe&s;&s;ion, were,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Strength of Party, by which they hop'd to Carry it at once, and Throw out the Treaty <HI>Brevi Manu;</HI> and this they endeavour'd to Form upon a General Di&s;like, they having Blacken'd it with the Mark of a Thing Di&s;honourable to the Sovereignty and the Inde|pendence of the Nation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. If they found that would not do, then to load it with &s;uch Ridiculous Amendments, as they knew would cau&s;e it to mi&s;carry in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament; which they al&s;o thought would give <HI>Scotland</HI> great Advantage, and Encrea&s;e the Animo&s;ities in <HI>Scotland</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> when the Rupture &s;hould appear to be from <HI>England,</HI> and the mo&s;t Rea&s;onable Conce&s;&s;ions of <HI>Scotland</HI> be Re|jected by them.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="102">
But both the&s;e Projects failed them; The fir&s;t was effectually An&s;wer'd by the Nature of the Thing; and their Strength fail|ing them, they found they had ca&s;t up their Account fal&s;e, their Motion being thrown out by a great Majority in Voting the fir&s;t Article, as will appear pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>The &s;econd, when they came to Examine Particulars, had not &s;ufficient Strength of Rea&s;on to &s;upport it; all the Amend|ments they could pretend to, were &s;o &s;mall, That, <HI>as above,</HI> the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> never thought it worth their while to Di&s;|pute them; and the Treaters them&s;elves, for the mo&s;t part, went into tho&s;e Amendments, as they were offered.</P>
<P>Indeed this was a Di&s;appointment to &s;ome People, who made no Que&s;tion, at lea&s;t, to puzzle the Cau&s;e, and rai&s;e &s;uch Difficul|ties, as &s;hould Require a Remitting the Treaty back to <HI>Scotland;</HI> and &s;o &s;pin it out in Length, that the Nations might have Lei&s;ure to Form the &s;eparate Parties into &s;ome Order; and rai&s;ing their Friends on both Sides, if po&s;&s;ible, bring it to a Breach&mdash;; And that I do not pa&s;s an unju&s;t Cen&s;ure, I refer the Reader, among Infinite Pamphlets publi&s;h'd again&s;t this Affair, to one very plain and bare-fac'd Author mentioned before, Entituled, <HI>The Nece&s;&s;ity of a War with</HI> England, <HI>in Order to Cure the pre&s;ent Di&s;tempers of the Times.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hould do the Fomenters of the Nations Divi&s;ions too much Credit, to Trouble the Reader of this with any of their Print|ed Oratory again&s;t this Union, much le&s;s enter into any Di&s;qui&s;iti|ons upon the Subject of their Clamours;&mdash;But I may, perhaps, touch upon the principal Heads of their Objections, and let the World know al&s;o, who were &s;ome of the Objectors.</P>
<P>When the Acts were thus pa&s;s'd, and Her Maje&s;ty had Nam'd Commi&s;&s;ioners on both Sides, and the Work &s;eemed to be going about in Earne&s;t; The Learned Scriblers of the Age began to Harra&s;s the World with their Schemes, and all the Mountebank State&s;men of the Times &s;et to Work, to propo&s;e their Wondrous Methods for Curing this Antient Di&s;temper of the Nations, and &s;triving to have it &s;aid of them&s;elves, who was Forwarde&s;t in the Great Work.</P>
<P>The Indu&s;try they di&s;cover'd had, in nothing, a greater Concur|rence, than in this, That the whole Croud of Writers, with an Univer&s;al Agreement, had the Honour to be intirely mi&s;taken; and not one of them had Eyes to &s;ee to the true Intere&s;t of the Nations; every Man, as, in &s;uch Ca&s;es is u&s;ual, Eyed the re&s;pective Intere&s;ts or Advantages, as he thought, of the Nation to which he belong'd, and &s;et him&s;elf to Work to An&s;wer the Objections of the other, Defending, Arguing, and Fatiguing their own Heads, and their Readers, with the Confu&s;ed Labyrinths of their own Projects; but not once touching the true String, which, with a National Uni&s;on, would have immediately Sounded out the Harmony of General Peace.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="103">
Nor am I at all Arrogant, in &s;aying, they were all &s;o generally mi&s;taken in their Notions of what this Union &s;hould be; Since, as I have &s;aid, every one fell to Arguing the &s;ingle and &s;eparate Ad|vantages of the Nation they belong'd to; In&s;i&s;ting on their Politick Notions, and Wi&s;e Schemes for their re&s;pective Advantages: But, not one, that I met with, ever Entered into the True and Only Notion E&s;&s;ential to the Union; I mean the Principle of Self-Denial, how far either Nation was to Conde&s;cend and Advance to one ano|ther, How the pre&s;ent Union Con&s;i&s;ted not, in Gaining Advantages on either Hand of one and other; but in Abatements, in giving each other Advantages, in yielding up Privileges, opening the Trea&s;ures and Strength of either Nation, to the Good and Benefit of the whole.</P>
<P>They never dream'd, That, to Unite, was, in it &s;elf, a full and a general Retribution for every Step taken from one Side to the other; That a New National Intere&s;t was to be Erected; and that giving or Conceding Rights, Advantages and Intere&s;ts, whe|ther in Commerce or in Privileges, was lo&s;ing nothing at all; but was like a Man giving Pre&s;ents to a Lady, whom he de&s;igns to make his Wife; which is but taking his Money out of one Pocket, and putting it into another; or like a Man &s;ettling his E&s;tate in Joynture on his Wife, which is &s;till his own, and is effectually &s;e|cured for his Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen mu&s;t pardon me, if I tell them, That, for want of this True and Original Notion of Union, they took but too much Pains to Inform us all, they had neither the Spirit of Union in their Minds, nor the Knowledge of it in their Heads&mdash;; And this run them upon Wild <HI>Dilemmas</HI> and Dark Schemes of Federati|ons and Confederations; This &s;ent them to <HI>Belgia, Helvetia, Po|lonia,</HI> and I know not whither, for Examples for Schemes, Prece|dents, and I know not what &s;trange Sy&s;tems of National Unions; all which, I mu&s;t take the Liberty to &s;ay, were as Wide from the only Step, that could make the&s;e Nations happy, as the Ea&s;t is from the We&s;t, tended to nothing, but Confu&s;ion of Intere&s;ts, National Jealou&s;ies, and in the end War and De&s;truction.</P>
<P>The&s;e Gentlemen were for making Bargains between the Nations, not for bringing two Great and Mighty Kingdoms into one Va&s;t United Body, the &s;ame in Intere&s;t, the &s;ame in Pro&s;pect, the &s;ame in every Sub&s;tantial Con&s;tituting Part; The Advocates of either People talk'd like Coun&s;ellors Pleading for their Clients, not like two Friends, that were Striving, who &s;hould part with mo&s;t, for the Intere&s;t and Engagement of the Love of each other.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the Union has been brought to pa&s;s, not by gaining from, but by yielding to one another; Not by making Conditions and Advantages of one another, but by Conceding to one another; One part opens the Trea&s;ures of their Trade, the other &s;truggles to bear their Share of the Weight and Burden of Expen&s;ive and Bloody Wars; This part yields up one thing, that abates another, and Mutual Conde&s;cen&s;ions, not Mutual Encroachments, have brought this Work to pa&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="104">
And here lyes the great My&s;tery of the Union; They that think &s;trange of the Circumlocutions the Wi&s;e&s;t Heads have taken, may find them here; They that Enquire into the Rea&s;ons of former Mi&s;carriages, may find them all here; If there was any want of Temper, any mutual Di&s;tru&s;ts, any &s;ecret Murmurs of Parties, any Jealou&s;ies of Con&s;equences, it was all to be found here; That the People, who Debated the&s;e Points, never Look'd beyond the pre|&s;ent State, never Con&s;idered the Conjunct Capacity of the Nations, never drew the Ballance of Intere&s;ts, or &s;tated the Affairs of both Nations into one Account Current.</P>
<P>Had they ever done this, they would have &s;een that Mon&s;ter, as they call'd the Union, a mo&s;t Beautiful Creature, Admirable in its Contexture, Agreeable in its Figure, Squar'd like a mo&s;t Exqui&s;ite Piece of Architect, both for Ornament, Strength, and U&s;efulne&s;s; They would have &s;een it a Compleat Circle, all the Lines of which were drawn from, and depended upon one General Centre, the Pub|lick Good, a Mighty Arch, every Stone of which mutually contribut|ed, not to its Private Support only, but to the Strength of the whole: Here is the True Original of the Union, and the Wi&s;dom of the Treaters on both &s;ides, was in nothing more Con&s;picuous, than that they came to this Treaty furni&s;hed with the true Notions of what they were to do, and con&s;equently the propere&s;t and only Method for the doing it could not be Concealed from them; and we cannot but ob&s;erve, That, thro' all the Cour&s;e of the Treaty, the Gentlemen kept them&s;elves clo&s;s to this Principle, to yield to one another in every thing, which the Nature of the Union they aim'd at requir'd, and the Nature of the Thing before them would po&s;&s;ibly permit.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, to me, all the Notions of Federal Unions, Gua|rantees, and Everla&s;ting Peace, which our &s;everal Writers fill'd our Heads with, while the Treaty was appointed, but not yet begun; appear'd to me as imperfect <HI>Embrios,</HI> fal&s;e Conceptions, and Births that mu&s;t end in Abortions and Di&s;appointments; I will not &s;ay, I had Fore&s;ight of Events enough to pre&s;cribe what Methods &s;hould be taken, or what I&s;&s;ue would be produced from the Treaty then in View; but this I took the Freedom always to tell the World, That it mu&s;t be a general, compleat, intire and indi&s;&s;olvable Union of In|tere&s;ts and Parties, depending upon Equalities of Privileges, and Equalities of Burdens, Equalities of Pro&s;pects, and Equalities, if po&s;&s;ible, in De&s;ires, or that it would be Imperfect in its Parts, and Confu&s;ed in its Whole.</P>
<P>I know one Rea&s;on why this &s;ort of Union was le&s;s thought on, than perhaps it would have been, was, becau&s;e the Gentlemen, when they come to Examine what had ever been Attempted this way, found nothing of a full and intire Union, but that under the Conque&s;t of the Parliament Times&mdash;; And, <HI>Alas! SAYS ONE,</HI> This mu&s;t be rendered &s;o Odious, becau&s;e 'twas the Work of a Tyrant, an U&s;urper, and what not, that no Body could bear to Recommend it; and if at any time a Man was driven by the Nece&s;&s;ity of his

<P>And why will you go by <HI>Whitehall</HI> Gentlemen, where &s;o many wicked Rebels Triumph'd over their Monarch? Why will you u&s;e the Navy, nay &s;ome of the very Ships, with which the &s;ame <HI>Oliver Cromwel</HI> Beat your Neighbours?</P>
<P>If <HI>Oliver</HI> had not been a Ma&s;ter of Politicks, he had never been <HI>Oliver Cromwel</HI> in the Terms we are now Talking of him; and becau&s;e he hit upon the only Step that could be taken to Fix the Union of the two Nations, mu&s;t we Reject it, and rather De&s;troy the Kingdoms, than clo&s;e with his Unhallowed Method?</P>
<P>Rea&s;on and the Nature of Things guides all Men, who&s;e Eyes are open, to the &s;ame Methods, when they are pur&s;uing the &s;ame De&s;igns, let <HI>Oliver Cromwel</HI> be what he will, and who he will, 'tis no part of my Bu&s;ine&s;s here, take him in all the Blacke&s;t Figures he can be Repre&s;ented&mdash;; What was the End he pur&s;ued in his Uniting <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England</HI>&mdash;? It was &s;o to joyn them, that both Parties being made intirely ea&s;y, might, without He&s;itation, &s;ub|mit them&s;elves to his otherwi&s;e precarious Authority; and was he right in this, That, to give the two Nations a free and full Communication, both of Trade, Privileges and Advantages, was the true and only way to make all People ea&s;ie&mdash;? So far his Project may be good for us, without &s;o much as touching upon the Parallel.</P>
<P>The Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Union was, to make the Nations ea&s;ie, to put them in a State of Mutual Advantage; If fourty Tyrants have pur&s;ued the Method for it, tho' with Wicked De&s;igns, it was for us to take the Method, and mend the De&s;ign, as much as we could.</P>
<P><HI>Oliver Cromwel</HI> made a Conque&s;t of <HI>Scotland</HI>&mdash;, well, and what then&mdash;? Let tho&s;e People, who have Talk'd &s;o much of an Union of Subjection, and Conquering <HI>Scotland,</HI> go back hither for a Precedent; <HI>Oliver Cromwel</HI> knew as well what belong'd to Conque&s;t, as any Body in this Age will pretend to; Nor was he le&s;s Politick in Keeping, than Terrible in Obtaining; and what did he re&s;olve all his Northern Conque&s;t into&mdash;? Nothing but Union, the be&s;t Concerted, the be&s;t Executed, the be&s;t Approved, that ever this I&s;land &s;aw till now; Nor could all the Heads in Chri&s;tendom have Formed the pre&s;ent Happy Union, but from the Schemes of tho&s;e Times.</P>
<P>If ever Nation gain'd by being Conquer'd, it was here; They were Subdued fir&s;t, and then made Happy; and <HI>Scotland</HI> Flouri&s;hed, Ju&s;tice had its Uninterrupted Cour&s;e, Trade Increas'd, Money plentifully Flowed in, and all under what they call'd Tyranny and U&s;urpation, all under a Standing Army, Government, and with all the Di&s;advantages that can be imagined from &s;uch a Con&s;titution, as tended to Subjection, not Liberty, Poverty and Mi&s;ery, not Peace and Plenty.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="106">
And what was the Foundation of all this? Nothing but the Na|tural Product of Common Rea&s;oning, he found, that the only way to pre&s;erve the Conque&s;t he had made on the Powers of the Nations, was to make a Conque&s;t of their Affections; That the only way to do this, was to let them &s;ee their Intere&s;t and Happine&s;s in his Government; and that this could only be brought to pa&s;s, by Uniting and intirely Incorporating the Nations into one; Commu|nicating Peace, Privileges, and all po&s;&s;ible Advantages to them&mdash;; And thereby letting them &s;ee the true way to their pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>No Man will &s;ay, this was not the mo&s;t Politick Step he could take; and mu&s;t we Contemn the Method, becau&s;e we cannot be Reconcil'd to the Man&mdash;? Certainly if Union and Incorporati|on of Intere&s;ts was able to make the Nation Happy under a &s;tand|ing Army, and an Ab&s;olute Government, as that was; Things in their Nature, Incon&s;i&s;tent with Liberty and National Pro&s;perity; it mu&s;t be much more Capable under a Ju&s;t and Limited Government, where Law Governs the very Actions of the Sovereign, and all the Branches of Power are &s;quar'd by, and &s;incerely Imploy'd for the Publick Good: And it can be no Le&s;&s;ening the Value of any True Scheme of National Management, that a Per&s;on U&s;ed or Contriv'd it, that we call a Tyrant or an U&s;urper; Let him be never &s;o much a Tyrant, he &s;how'd he had the True Spirit of Government in him by this, that he knew the only way to make his Government &s;afe, was to make it ea&s;y; and to have the People quiet, was to make them Happy&mdash;; And this he did by <HI>&V;nion,</HI> an intire In|corporated Union&mdash;; And the Event proved, his Mea&s;ures were rightly taken.</P>
<P>Our End is now the &s;ame, tho' our Views are differing, to make the People Happy is the End&mdash;; If <HI>&V;nion</HI> be the way, why is it to be liked the wor&s;e, becau&s;e <HI>Oliver Cromwel</HI> drew the Scheme?</P>
<P>I have made this Digre&s;&s;ion, not purely to &s;how, how our Writ|ers came to be mi&s;taken in their Schemes, and why they never hit upon this Draught in all their Propo&s;als, tho' that introduc'd it; but al&s;o to prove, that this Intire Incoporating Union has in it &s;elf the Seed of National Felicity, in that it wrought then that Wonder which the World can rarely produce, <HI>viz.</HI> Liberty in Tyranny, Pro&s;perity in Conque&s;t, and a Nation Saved even in being Sub|dued.</P>
<P>Could it produce this Wonderful Effect, much more mu&s;t it be &s;uppo&s;ed Capable now? And I am per&s;waded, no Man in his Sen&s;es will like the Effect of the pre&s;ent Union the wor&s;e, for its receiving any of its parts from the Politicks of the&s;e Times, if the Happine&s;s of the pre&s;ent Time may be &s;een in it.</P>
<P>And here I mu&s;t own, That the pre&s;ent Union has &s;ome Ad|vantage, <HI>tho' the Nations have paid dear for the Experiment,</HI> in that it has been Formed upon the Foot of all the mo&s;t Politick Schemes of former Times; and all the Mi&s;carriages of former Treaties have been as Warnings to Furni&s;h the Experience of the&s;e Times
<PB N="12" REF="107">
to make them wary, and in&s;truct them how to avoid the Rocks that others Split on.</P>
<P>I have now brought the Treaters to <HI>London;</HI> Their Names, and the Commi&s;&s;ion for them re&s;pectively to Treat, I have In&s;erted in the Minutes of the Treaty, as it was laid before the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and immediately following this Part.</P>
<P>When they fir&s;t met, they hardly knew what Mea&s;ures they &s;hould take; They knew what Bu&s;ine&s;s they came to do, but I dare &s;ay, the Gentlemen will bear with me, in &s;aying, they could not fore|&s;ee the Manner and Management that follow'd; and it was a plea&s;|ing Surprize, to find all Sides and Parties to agree, in leaving all Politick Methods formerly &s;tudied, rather to Delay and Defeat the De&s;ign of an Union, than to Compleat it; and to fall in heartily to Con&s;ider, as the General <HI>The&s;is,</HI> what could Conduce mo&s;t to the Main De&s;ign of their Meeting, <HI>THE &V;NION;</HI> And in Or|der to this, they Re&s;olved not to Study Advantages again&s;t one another; nor to Demand on either Side any Thing, but what was agreeable to both Kingdoms, in their United Capacity; This was a Happy Indication, That both Sides came together with a True Spi|rit of the Union among them; That they &s;incerely intended to apply them&s;elves to it with the utmo&s;t Diligence, and to pur&s;ue it by all the mo&s;t proper Methods to bring it to pa&s;s&mdash;; The very contrary Extreme of which, is what, as I have already noted, has been the principal Occa&s;ion of the Mi&s;carriage of all the former Treaties, and which Good Men were very much afraid of now&mdash;.</P>
<P>Before they met in Publick, &s;ome of the Commi&s;&s;ioners on both Sides had a Meeting among them&s;elves, privately to Con&s;ider of the Method of Proceeding.</P>
<P>And here it was fir&s;t Debated, in what Manner Propo&s;als &s;hould be Delivered and Receiv'd; Some were for having Conferences of every Thing that &s;hould be propo&s;ed, for the Convenience of Free Rea&s;oning; Others Objected again&s;t that as Tedious, and Offered as the mo&s;t Expeditious Method, That every Thing &s;hould be De|livered in Writing, and then the Commi&s;&s;ioners re&s;pectively Meeting apart, might Rea&s;on among them&s;elves, and give in their Re&s;olutions the more perfect&mdash;; And this was agreed on by both parties.</P>
<P>This is the Cau&s;e, That, in the Minutes of this Treaty, we have little of their private Rea&s;onings Recorded; &s;ince, their having been thus by them&s;elves, they have not been noticed &s;o, as to come to Light in any Regular Manner.</P>
<P>There was but one Publick Conference, which was De&s;ir'd by the Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>Scotland;</HI> and this was about the Number of the <HI>Scots</HI> Repre&s;entatives in Parliament; and in this 'tis impo&s;|&s;ible to get the particular Arguments u&s;ed on both Sides. The par|ticular Per&s;ons on either Side were as follows,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t</HI> the Lord Trea&s;urer of <HI>England,</HI> who Opened the Thing, and De&s;ir'd the Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> to propo&s;e their Rea&s;ons, why the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hould give a greater Number than was mentioned.</P>
<P>Lord Chancellor of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;poke next, and gave Rea&s;ons why they In&s;i&s;ted upon a greater Number.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="108">
Mr. Secretary <HI>Harley</HI> Replyed to Lord Chancellor of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>The Lord Chancellor Spoke a Second Time, in An&s;wer to Mr. Secretary <HI>Harley.</HI></P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> Spoke after, to what the Lord Chancellor had offered.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Stair</HI> Replyed to the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI>'s Speech.</P>

<P>Sir <HI>David Dalrymple</HI> Follow'd the Lord Keeper.</P>
<P>Duke of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> to Sir <HI>David.</HI></P>
<P>And Mr. <HI>Seton</HI> of <HI>Pitmedden</HI> Concluded.</P>
<P>The great De&s;ign of the Arguments on the part of the <HI>Scots</HI> Com|mi&s;&s;ioners, were &s;umm'd up in this;</P>
<P>That they could have no Precedent, as to Number of Repre&s;en|tatives, Argued from <HI>Oliver Cromwel</HI>'s Divi&s;ion; becau&s;e he was Ar|bitrary, and neither gave a ju&s;t Repre&s;entation to <HI>England,</HI> or to <HI>Ireland;</HI></P>
<P>That the pre&s;ent Scheme of Taxes could not be the Rule; but, if the Repre&s;entative was to be Mea&s;ur'd by the Proportion of Taxes, it was on their Side; &s;ince, immediately upon the Union, tho&s;e Taxes would be greater;</P>
<P>That, if any Rule could be laid down, it ought to be an Arith|metical Proportion, between the Number of People and the Taxes paid, Con&s;idered on both Sides re&s;pectively; In which Ca&s;e, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were brought as an Example, where, if you take the People, without their Circum&s;tances of Wealth, they Bear no Pro|portion, becau&s;e their Riches are va&s;tly greater than their Num|bers; If their Riches are taken without their People, the Di&s;pro|portion would be as great the other way.</P>
<P>Upon the whole it was Concluded, there could be no certain Rule, to Direct their Lord&s;hips the Commi&s;&s;ioners, but the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances of the Nations &s;hould be Judg'd of by both Sides, and &s;uch a Repre&s;entative to be Allow'd, as &s;hould be Agree|able to Ju&s;tice in both.</P>
<P>Upon this Debate, their Lord&s;hips Retired on either Hand; and the next Day, the Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>England</HI> brought in a Propo&s;al for a Repre&s;entative for <HI>Scotland,</HI> Augmented to Fourty Five Com|moners, and Sixteen Lords, which the <HI>Scots</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners acqui|e&s;c'd in, as will more particularly appear by the Minutes of the Treaty, which are in&s;erted at large, as they were Extracted out of the Books of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, and beginning with the Com|mi&s;&s;ions re&s;pectively given to the Per&s;ons Appointed to Treat, as follows.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS on the <HI>MINUTS</HI> of the three fir&s;t Days.</HEAD>
<P>The Ceremonies on either Hand being over, <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> was the fir&s;t Day in which it may be &s;aid, any thing of Bu&s;ine&s;s was entred upon.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ide pre&s;ented a Summary, as it may be call'd, of an Union in General, by which it is plain, a compleat Incorporation of the two Kingdoms was propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> Propo&s;al was le&s;s General, and yet readily agreeing to the Succe&s;&s;ion, to a Communication of Privileges, and an Inter|cour&s;e of Trade.</P>
<P>I mention this here, becau&s;e it was afterwards objected to the Treaters on the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;ide in the following Parliament, That
<PB N="25" REF="120">
they had given up their Countrey to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> in coming into an Incorporating Union immediately, without propo&s;ing any Terms which might have been more Advantageous to <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>It is manife&s;t the <HI>Scots</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners did make Propo&s;als of Uniting, which were not Incorporating; or at lea&s;t, which being re&s;tricted to their own Countrey only, were &s;ignificant of a Concern for <HI>Scotland,</HI> leaving the Propo&s;al on the behalf of <HI>England,</HI> to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners.</P>
<P>But, as will appear in the &s;ub&s;equent Minuts, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Comm&s;&s;ioners were come to a Re&s;olution previous to this Treaty, <HI>viz.</HI> That nothing could compleat the Felicity of either King|dom, and for ever remove all po&s;&s;ible Difficulties, Breaches, and Separation of Intere&s;ts from among them for the future, but an entire and Incorporating Union, by which the two Nations &s;hould be formed into one Government, be under one Sove|reign Head, in one Repre&s;ented Body, &s;tanding upon one Foun|dation, enjoying equal Privileges, and in common bearing one ge|neral proportion of Burdens, the &s;ame in End and Mean, having but one Common Intere&s;t, one Name, and being for ever here|after but one People.</P>
<P>This therefore they laid down as the <HI>The&s;is</HI> of their future Conferences, and pur&s;uant to this, the fir&s;t General they delive|red in, contain'd the Three and mo&s;t E&s;&s;ential Articles of the following Treaty, <HI>viz.</HI> The Uniting the Two Kingdoms into One, the &s;ettling the Repre&s;entation in one A&s;&s;embly of Par|liament, and the &s;ettling the Succe&s;&s;ion in the &s;ame Line.</P>
<P>And the <HI>Scots</HI> Propo&s;als being &s;hort in the General Incorpo|rating Part, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners in&s;i&s;ted upon it, as above, de|clining to Treat upon Particulars till that was fir&s;t Determin'd, all Debate of Particulars being not &s;o directly tending to a Con|clu&s;ion, till the great and main Que&s;tion was Agreed to, Whe|ther the Union &s;hould be Entire or no, in the &s;en&s;e as above.</P>
<P>The pro&s;ecuting this Que&s;tion will effectually Defend the <HI>Scots</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners, who tho they were afterward convinc'd of the main Point in Debate, <HI>viz.</HI> That nothing but an Entire Union would be effectual to &s;ettle a la&s;ting Friend&s;hip between the two Nations, yet did not &s;o ea&s;ily give up their other Pro|po&s;als, as was &s;ugge&s;ted; nor did they give them up at all meerly upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners refu&s;ing to Treat on any other Foot&mdash;. For the directe&s;t An&s;wer to a Re&s;olution &s;o po&s;i|tive as that might have been thought to have been an equal Stiffne&s;s, and refu&s;ing to re&s;olve upon &s;o general a Clau&s;e, till other Heads had been Adju&s;ted.</P>
<P>But the Commi&s;&s;ioners on the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;ide found them&s;elves convinc'd, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Of the Sincerity and candid Intentions of the Commi&s;&s;ioners on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Part, to pur&s;ue &s;uch a Treaty, and in &s;uch a manner, as might mo&s;t conduce to the mutual Hap|pine&s;s
<PB N="26" REF="121">
of both Kingdoms, and to make the Union both La&s;ting and Effectual.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> They found them&s;elves convinc'd upon &s;erious De|bate and further Enquiry into Particulars, that nothing but this Incorporation of Intere&s;ts, Privileges, and Circum&s;tances, could make an Effectual, La&s;ting, Indi&s;&s;olvable Union, and &s;o they came unto it with the &s;ame Sincerity, and from the &s;ame candid De&s;ign of &s;ettling the whole, and of Acting to the advantage of Either Party&mdash;. Not being at all Over-ruled, Awed, or Drawn in, as was objected afterwards again&s;t them&mdash;. And this would appear at large, if the long Debates, Speeches, and Arguments on both Sides could have been recover'd.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION III.</HEAD>
<P>The main Points of Union being thus &s;ettled, as above, and all the Federal Provincial and Confederating Schemes, which the World without Doors had filled their Heads with, being va|ni&s;h'd, the Commi&s;&s;ioners fell clo&s;s to their Work; and the fir&s;t Article propo&s;ed by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners laid the Scheme of the whole Affair, <HI>viz.</HI> Cu&s;toms, Exci&s;es, and Temporary Taxes, Prohibitions, Re&s;trictions, and Regulations of Trade.</P>
<P>The great Que&s;tion now before them was, how to fix a Center in all the&s;e, or a great Standart of Equalities, &s;o as every part might bear its equal Share of the Burdens of the War, in Proportion to its Capacity, and every part enjoy its equal Share of the Advan|tages of Commerce, each bear an equal part of the Weight of the Government, and reap an equal part of its Protection. This Scale of Equalities had a great Variety of Di&s;cording Parts in it; To bring together the Difficulties of which was the Bu&s;ine&s;s now before them, and the Method of Reconciling them, will appear in the further Ob&s;ervations on the&s;e Proceedings.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing requi&s;it to bring this Matter into a way of De|bate, was for either &s;ide to give in a True State of the ordinary Revenue, the Debts and the Extraordinary Taxes of either King|dom, that a Scale of Proportions might be formed.</P>
<P>I mention it here, to note how naturally every thing occurr'd, in order to the main End; and how, after the fir&s;t Conce&s;&s;ion of an entire Incorporation, every thing, that might tend to Compleating that De&s;ign, came in of Cour&s;e; For, without doubt, Equalities and Proportion of Taxes, Privileges and Ad|vantages, was, and mu&s;t be the only Method, to bring about a compleat entire Union of Intere&s;ts, and it was impo&s;&s;ible to be done without it.</P>
<P>The Undertaking indeed Amazed the World, and when People began to look into it with but a Tran&s;ient View, it appeared a
<PB N="30" REF="125">
perfect <HI>Chaos,</HI> a Ma&s;s of Ab&s;urdities, which it would be impo&s;|&s;ible to Reconcile; The People, who had propo&s;ed their Fede|ral Schemes, laugh'd at this Project, and talk'd of it as impracti|cable, called it a <HI>Chimera</HI> of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mini&s;tery, and pretended to Prophe&s;y its Dwindling into Nothing, and bringing the Treaty to the &s;ame I&s;&s;ue, as was done in the la&s;t Commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But, when Abler Heads began to look into it, and take it to Pieces, the Parts all appear'd capable of Reduction into Form, and the Pre&s;ages of the Gentlemen who had &s;o Banter'd it, ap|pear'd groundle&s;s, the Ma&s;s began to move, and every thing re|tiring to its proper place, guided by the Temper, Moderation, and Application of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, the Beautiful Thing, cal|led Union, began to &s;hew it &s;elf, and the Nation began to con|ceive Hopes of its being perfected, in &s;pight of all the &s;eeming Difficulties, with which the Enemies to the De&s;ign had clog'd Mens Expectation&mdash;, as will appear hereafter.</P>
<P>To bring the Ballance of Circum&s;tances upon the Stage, it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to enter into the &s;everal Inequalities, in which the two Kingdoms then &s;tood; The&s;e Inequalities, as they lay particularly before the Treaters, con&s;i&s;ted in Matters of Taxes, Cu&s;toms, Exci&s;es and Commerce.</P>
<P>In order to &s;tate the&s;e, the &s;everal Debts and Revenue of the re&s;pective Nations were &s;tated; Ab&s;tracts of which are annexed to the&s;e Ob&s;ervations, as they were given in to the Commi&s;&s;io|ners of both Kingdoms.</P>

<P>But, on the other Hand, <HI>England</HI> had va&s;t Debts lay upon them to di&s;charge; and for the Di&s;charge of which, the&s;e Re|venues, and almo&s;t all their other Taxes, the Land Tax and Malt Tax excepted, were Appropriated.

<P>But then the Revenue of <HI>Scotland</HI> was entirely free from Anti|cipations, or Appropriations on any Account of Debt; Not, but that there were Publick Debts too, but the Revenue was not Charged with them.</P>
<P>Now, upon the Uniting the Revenues of both Kingdoms, under the&s;e differing Circum&s;tances, there were but two po&s;&s;ible Me|thods that could be propo&s;ed;
<LIST>
<PB N="32" REF="127">
<ITEM>Either, 1. That each Kingdom coming to a full Point in Matters of Revenue, &s;hould, like two Trade&s;men coming into Partner&s;hip, pay off their own re&s;pective Debts, and bring in their &s;everal Proportions of Stock clear of all In|cumberances.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Or, 2. That, putting the General Accounts of Debts and Stock together, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hould make good the Inequa|lities to the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;ome other way.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners wi&s;ely propo&s;ed, for the Ea&s;e of their own Country, That the Revenues of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould not be at all Chargeable with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Debts&mdash;; And this was thought to be a very good Argument, to Excu&s;e <HI>Scotland</HI> from &s;ome Duties, which, notwith&s;tanding the General Article of pay|ing Equal Taxes, <HI>Scotland</HI> could by no means bear; Of the&s;e, as they re&s;pect Cu&s;toms or Exci&s;es, Foreign or Home Trade, I &s;hall &s;peak as they come in Order.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners adhering to the fir&s;t Principle of the Treaty, <HI>viz.</HI> Of its being an intire Incorporating Union, were on that Account obliged to in&s;i&s;t upon this al&s;o, which formed afterward, the Sixth Article, <HI>viz.</HI> That there be an E|quality of <HI>Cu&s;toms, Exci&s;es,</HI> and all other Taxes thro'out the United Kingdom, as that without which the Union could not be entire.</P>
<P>This being laid down as a general <HI>The&s;is</HI> in the whole Debate, two things came in Cour&s;e to be Examined as <HI>Mediums.</HI><LIST>
<ITEM>1. A Scale of Proportions to form the Equalities.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. An Equivalent to be given for &s;upplying unavoidable In|equalities.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>And this will be found to run thro' the whole Series of the Trea|ty, as the Foundation of the whole; and however after Ridi|cul'd and Reflected on by the Oppo&s;ers of the Treaty, it ap|pears to be the only Foundation they could have gone upon, and which was the only <HI>Medium</HI> to bring the Treaty into a po&s;&s;ibi|lity of coming to a happy Conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>No Man could deny but all Equalities con&s;i&s;ted in Proporti|ons, and to have extended the thing called Equality of Taxes, to a Numerical Equality, as &s;ome pretend in <HI>England,</HI> was &s;aying nothing, the Cu&s;toms, manner of Valuation of Land, and innu|merable Circum&s;tances of <HI>Scotland,</HI> rendering it Impracticable.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commi&s;sioners therefore when they in&s;i&s;ted upon an Equality of Taxes, readily agreed to the giving <HI>Scotland</HI> an Equivalent for the payment of their own Debts, &s;o far as their Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;es &s;hould come into the Appropriations of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Revenue.</P>
<P>What Alterations, Exceptions, and Abatements were made as to Equalities of Taxes, will be &s;poken to in the Minutes of the <HI>Scots</HI> Parliament, where the Exceptions were made, and tho&s;e Calculations Adju&s;ted.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION V.</HEAD>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners were now entered upon the great Enqui|ry about Equalities, and the fir&s;t Matter relating to Taxes was that of the Land Tax; The Land Tax in <HI>England</HI> was a For|midable Thing, being called a Tax of Four Shillings in the Pound of the Rent of Lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And the People who were Fond of Throwing a Tangled Skein in the Hands of the Treat|ers, that might Shock them at the beginning, would have gone upon that Foot, alledging, That tho' the Rents in <HI>Scotland</HI> were differing from tho&s;e in <HI>England;</HI> yet that 20 <HI>&s;h. &s;terl.</HI> Re|venue being the &s;ame thing any where, it could as well afford to pay 4 <HI>&s;h.</HI> out of it in <HI>Scotland</HI> as any where el&s;e; and upon this Foot, it &s;eems, were for bringing the Rents of Land in <HI>Scot|land</HI> to a true E&s;timate, and &s;o they would call this way of Taxing an Equality.</P>
<P>But to this it was An&s;wer'd, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That the <HI>Scots</HI> way of Collecting their Taxes, being rigorous and exact, if 4 <HI>s. per l.</HI> were laid by Parliament upon the whole I&s;land, their A&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ments would <HI>bona fide</HI> be 4 <HI>s. per l.</HI> upon the Rack Rent of all their Lands.</P>
<P>Whereas 4 <HI>s. per l.</HI> in <HI>England</HI> never puts the A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors out of their old Road, but every County being Rated in the very Bo|dy of the Act, the Title is <HI>Ip&s;o Facto</HI> Repeal'd, &s;ince if the Lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of that Country will rai&s;e the Money by an A&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ment of 1 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d. per</HI> Pound, <HI>and 'tis known &s;ome do for le&s;s,</HI> the Law is &s;atisfied, and the End an&s;wered.</P>
<P>Now to Tax <HI>Scotland</HI> at 4 <HI>s. per l.</HI> upon her Nett Rent, and Tax the Northern and We&s;tern Counties of <HI>England</HI> but at &s;o much Money, which they can rai&s;e by a Proportion of 16 <HI>d.</HI> to 20 <HI>d.</HI> at mo&s;t <HI>per l.</HI> would be unrea&s;onable.</P>
<P>So that it was plain, <HI>Scotland</HI> could not be Taxed at a Pound Rate, but at a Proportioned Summ, leaving them to the Divi&s;ion of it, to rai&s;e it as they &s;ee fit.</P>
<P N="2">II. The Sum charg'd upon Lands in <HI>England,</HI> after it is le|vied and rai&s;ed from the Tenant, &s;tands charg'd with large De|ductions
<PB N="38" REF="133">
and Charges, upon the Levying, Collecting, and Re|ceiving; and tho&s;e Charges, if &s;ome Calculations are right, amount to little le&s;s than 9 <HI>d. per l.</HI> upon the Money receiv'd, be&s;ides publick Lo&s;&s;es by the In&s;olvency of Receivers and their Securities, which oftentimes runs deep into the Money; and which tho' they cannot be brought into an exact Account, yet put all together, 12 <HI>d. per</HI> Pound may at lea&s;t very well be Charg'd upon the whole, as an Off-Reckoning or Di&s;count up|on the Money, between the Collection and Exchequer.</P>
<P>This 12 <HI>d. per</HI> Pound upon the Money Collected is 2 <HI>d.</HI> 8/20 <HI>per</HI> Pound upon all the Rents in <HI>England,</HI> and amounts in every Land Tax to near a Hundred Thou&s;and Pound <HI>Sterling.</HI></P>
<P>Now as on the other hand, the <HI>Scots</HI> Collect all their Tax at their own Charges, clear of all Lo&s;&s;es, Deficiencies or Defalca|tions, and pay it in Nett to the Exchequer or Publick Trea|&s;ure, to Charge them by the &s;ame Numerical Equality with <HI>Eng|land,</HI> would be to make them pay their Taxes clear of Charge, and bear part of the Expence and Lo&s;s in Collecting ours.</P>
<P N="3">III. Differing Cu&s;toms and Manners of paying Rent, and letting out Lands in the two Kingdoms, make a Numerical Equality Impracticable.</P>
<P>In <HI>England</HI> the Rents are paid in Mony, in <HI>Scotland</HI> they are, generally &s;peaking, paid in Kind, or Victual, as they call it: Now tho' 'tis true this may, and is, in &s;ome re&s;pect, brought to a Head by a General Valuation, yet, with this Difference, again&s;t a <HI>Scots</HI> Landlord to an <HI>Engli&s;h, viz.</HI> That the <HI>Scots</HI> Land|lord &s;tays two Terms, and runs two Ri&s;ques in his receiving the Rent of his Land.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t he &s;tays the Term agreed to receive of his Tenant, and &s;econdly he tru&s;ts the Merchant a &s;econd Term, to whom he &s;ells the Produce he receives of his Tenant; in the &s;ame Sen&s;e he runs two Hazards; one in the Solvency of the Tenant, and the other of the Merchant; which makes a con&s;iderable Difference in the E&s;&s;ential Value of the Rent, and con&s;equently of the Pur|cha&s;e of &s;uch an E&s;tate; and tho' the Purcha&s;e or Real Va|lue of Lands in <HI>Scotland</HI> may not come into this Di&s;pute; yet were an E&s;tate let in <HI>England</HI> to pay the Rent in Kind, it would &s;ell for much le&s;s than an E&s;tate of the &s;ame Value paid in Spe|cie: Nor would it be Tax'd at near &s;o much in our Common A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The Difference in letting Lands in <HI>England,</HI> which are in many Places fin'd down, and the &s;tated Rents reduc'd, makes another Variation: Whereas in <HI>Scotland</HI> Lands are let without Lea&s;es, or but on &s;hort Terms, and at a Rack-Rent; any Man that knows what belongs to Letting or Taking Lands in <HI>Eng|land</HI> cannot be ignorant&mdash;, That the Landlord, letting a long Lea&s;e to the Tenant, confining him to &s;uch and &s;uch Im|provement, makes frequent Con&s;iderations in the Rent, and &s;o the Land being Taxed by the Rent, is Taxed under the Value.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="134">
On the other hand, &s;hould this Article of 4 <HI>s. per l.</HI> be in&s;i&s;t|ed on in the literal Sence, and the <HI>Scots</HI> come to con&s;ider how to avoid it, by Fining down Rents and other Advantageous Methods, which they may ea&s;ily find out, they might &s;oon e|vade the Act, and pay little or nothing; and this would be an Evil hard to di&s;cover; and if found out, almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to cure.</P>
<P>From the&s;e Rea&s;ons it was plain, a Numerical or Arithmetical Equality could not be the Foundation of tho&s;e Debates&mdash;; But as it was very well Stiled, it behoved to be a Geometrical Equality, founded on a Scale of Proportions, and that Scale for|med upon due Con&s;iderations, not of real Value only, but of Circum&s;tances and Pro&s;pects of either Kingdom.</P>
<P>A &s;econd Calculate was then propo&s;ed from the Proportion which <HI>Scotland</HI> was oblig'd to pay under <HI>Oliver Cromwel,</HI> who having reduc'd <HI>Scotland</HI> by Arms, Incorporated them into one Body with this Nation; and by this Incorporation they were Rated at 6000 <HI>l. per</HI> Month in their Land Tax, when <HI>England</HI> was Rated at 70000 <HI>l. per</HI> Month.</P>
<P>It al&s;o appears by the &s;ame Calculation, that <HI>Scotland</HI> paid this 6000 <HI>l. per</HI> Month, when <HI>England</HI> paid but 35000 <HI>l. per</HI> Month.</P>
<P>Now to apply this Calculation to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the Land Tax in <HI>England</HI> in time of War, at 4 <HI>s. per l.</HI> is &s;uppos'd to rai&s;e two Millions <HI>&s;terling.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> paying 6000 to <HI>Englands</HI> 35000 <HI>per</HI> Month, which is &s;omething le&s;s than a &s;ixth part; By the &s;ame Rule in two Mil|lions <HI>per Annum,</HI> which the &s;aid Land Tax rai&s;es, they mu&s;t be chargeable with 333333. 6. 8. <HI>per Annum,</HI> Land Tax.</P>
<P>But this Arbitray difference which <HI>Oliver Cromwel</HI> and his Parliament made; as is ob&s;erv'd, was, <HI>In con&s;ideration that</HI> Eng|land <HI>had, for Divers years pa&s;t, been at almo&s;t all the Expence of War;</HI> Yet &s;till, at the former Calculation, <HI>Scotland</HI> would in a four Shilling Aid, pay half that Sum, <HI>viz.</HI> 166666. 13. 4. <HI>per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>Now to examine the Rents of each Kingdom, the Annual Rents of Lands in <HI>Scotland,</HI> mu&s;t by the fir&s;t Calculation, amount to One Million, Six Hundred, Sixty Six Thou&s;and, Six Hundred, Sixty Six Pound, Thirteen and Four Pence Sterling, <HI>per Annum,</HI> and by the la&s;t Calculation ju&s;t half the Money.</P>
<P>Both which Sums it was alleaged are far wide of an Equality, and far beyond what <HI>Scotland</HI> is able to rai&s;e.</P>
<P>I am the larger on this Head, that Po&s;terity may &s;ee the Rea|&s;ons why the&s;e Calculations were made, and have the Arguments pre&s;erved for their u&s;e, if it be Di&s;puted hereafter, why <HI>Scot|land</HI> &s;hould pay &s;o &s;mall a Proportion in the Land Taxes or four Shilling Aid, and which may help others to Defend <HI>Scotland</HI> again&s;t future Attempts, to enlarge their Expences.</P>
<P>The next thing was to Examine what was, or what might be counted a due Equality; and here it will be nece&s;&s;ary to enter
<PB N="40" REF="135">
a little into the &s;hort Hi&s;tory of Taxes in <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;ince the Re|&s;toration; which, bringing it down to the pre&s;ent Time, may &s;erve as a Rule to this Matter.</P>
<P>Anciently the levying Money upon Land in <HI>Scotland,</HI> was called in General <HI>the Taxation;</HI> and the manner of levying it was by Rules altogether ob&s;olete and now grown out of U&s;e, as the Cu&s;tom of Tenths, Fifteenths, Sub&s;idies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The now Method of Taxing Land has its beginning, as to Practice, in the A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment of 6000 <HI>l. per</HI> Month, &s;ettle in <HI>Scot|land</HI> in <HI>Cromwel</HI>'s time, when an Union was actually form'd and &s;ettled between the Nations; of which, however deficient in it &s;elf, without doubt this may be &s;aid, that it had in it the E&s;&s;en|tial Parts, and might be modell'd into a compleat Coalition.</P>
<P>This is the Tax they now go by in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and is called there THE CESS, by which is under&s;tood <HI>a Month's A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment;</HI> 'tis rai&s;ed upon Land by a Method peculiarly exact, and I have never heard any one complain of the Inequality.</P>
<P>'Tis rai&s;ed, as is before noted, without any Charge, Deducti|on, or Defalcation, and is paid <HI>Nett</HI> into the Trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>According as the Occa&s;ions of the Government require, this Tax is encrea&s;ed; but then not the Sum <HI>per</HI> Month is encrea&s;ed, but the number of Months are encrea&s;ed, which by the help of time encrea&s;es the Sum.</P>
<P>The Original of the Demand was as before, and of the Me|thod, but the Continuance of it was thus introduced;</P>
<P>In former times, the Kings of <HI>Scotland</HI> contented them&s;elves with the ancient Deme&s;nes, Crown-Lands, Cu&s;toms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and on extraordinary Ca&s;es <HI>the Taxation, as above,</HI> was their Supply, Exci&s;es of any &s;ort were altogether unknown, till the Days of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second.</P>
<P>King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second in the Year 1661, obtained of the <HI>Scots</HI> to give him a &s;ettled Sum of 40000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling during his Life, in con&s;ideration whereof, he promi&s;ed never to demand any Ce&s;s or <HI>Taxation,</HI> except in time of War, as by the Words of the Act as follows&mdash;.</P>

<P>In this Taxation or Ce&s;s the &s;everal Court Parties &s;truggled, who &s;hould give their Country away fa&s;te&s;t, the Bi&s;hops got in|to every part of the Civil Juri&s;diction; the Severities again&s;t the People fir&s;t drove them into De&s;parations and Rebellions, and then &s;uch Advantages were taken, and &s;uch u&s;e made of the &s;aid In&s;urrections to ruine others, that the poor People were brought to the Brink of general Ruine: the Nation being brought to that pa&s;s, that a Man might be fin'd or <HI>for faulted;</HI> that is, his E&s;tate taken from him, for his Wives giving a Half-penny at his Door to a common Beggar, on pretence it was relieving a Rebel.</P>
<P>Thus poor <HI>Scotland</HI> was bought and &s;old, and the Example is u&s;eful for our Ob&s;ervation a great many ways; for thus &s;hall every Nation be u&s;ed, that is divided into contending Parties, and expos'd to an encroaching Government.</P>
<P>But that I may not have &s;aid all this foreign to the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, it is very ob&s;ervable, <HI>and this is the Rea&s;on of the Quo|tation,</HI> that this will make one PERIOD for Taxation, <HI>viz.</HI> the
<PB N="43" REF="138">
highe&s;t that an Arbitrary Prince back'd with a Mercenary Nobi|lity, and a Governing Clergy, even in the greate&s;t Extream of Ab&s;olute Tyranny, ever impos'd upon this Nation, which at that time 'tis evident they de&s;ir'd to &s;queeze, and car'd not if they entirely ruin'd.</P>
<P>Come we now to the Revolution, which the&s;e Exorbitances had no little Influence upon; the fir&s;t thing Tran&s;acted upon the Meeting of the E&s;tates or Convention of <HI>Scotland,</HI> was to break the&s;e Chains; re-a&s;&s;ume the Power of rai&s;ing Taxes by Parliament, and make them&s;elves Judges both of the Occa&s;ion, and of the Sum.</P>
<P>However as in <HI>England</HI> &s;ince the Revolution, greater Occa&s;i|ons have call'd for immen&s;e Sums to carry on the War; and &s;uch Taxes have been rais'd as were never heard of before; &s;o in <HI>Scotland</HI> the Parliament have agreed to &s;uch Taxes, as, the afore&s;aid Time of Tyranny excepted, were never known in <HI>Scotland</HI> before.</P>
<P>Yet, in the carrying on this War, &s;ix or &s;even Months Ce&s;s, has, one time with another, been thought <HI>Scotland</HI>'s full Pro|portion, and the late KING, excepting one or two Years on ex|traordinary Occa&s;ions, always contented him&s;elf with it, and this at the &s;ame time that <HI>England</HI> rais'd 4 <HI>s. per l.</HI> upon their Land; Nor did Queen <HI>Anne</HI> ever demand more of her Subjects in <HI>Scotland,</HI> tho' the Weight of the War was as great as ever, and this was called another PERIOD of Taxation.</P>
<P>Now, what was mean't by a Geometrical Scale, or Equali|ty in Taxes, is drawn from the&s;e Proportions.</P>
<P>That, &s;ince exact Valuation of Rents cannot be made on both &s;ides, and lea&s;t of all in <HI>England,</HI> it &s;eems as good a way to come at this Equality, as any could be propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>That the highe&s;t Period of Taxes that ever <HI>Scotland</HI> bore &s;ince the Re&s;toration, may be taken on one hand, and &s;et a|gain&s;t the highe&s;t Period of Taxes that ever <HI>England</HI> bore, <HI>that is,</HI> of a Land Tax on both &s;ides; and put the&s;e together as the Scale of Equality.</P>
<P>Thus &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Scots</HI> 8 Months Ce&s;s, tho' that was the heighth of Tyrannick Impo&s;ition, and tho' 'tis allowed the <HI>Scots</HI> are manife&s;tly impoveri&s;h'd, and le&s;s able to bear it than they were; yet &s;ay, it be full 8 Months Ce&s;s, and &s;et this again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> 4 <HI>s. per l.</HI> it could not be found, that any more ju&s;t Calculation could be made; And the Proportion &s;eem'd &s;o clear, that every &s;ide appeared content with it.</P>
<P>Thus when ever a Tax upon Land for 4 <HI>s. per</HI> Pound is grant|ed, the <HI>Scots</HI> pay 8 Months Ce&s;s, if of 2 <HI>s. per</HI> Pound in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> 4 Months Ce&s;s; and &s;o in Proportion.</P>
<P>There were other Calculations offered about that time, but none &s;eemed &s;o rationally and &s;o exactly &s;tated to the Circum|&s;tances of the Nations, or built on &s;o ju&s;t a Foundation; and therefore it met with le&s;s Difficulty than was expected, as will appear hereafter.</P>

As to Duties on Stampt Paper, Vellom and Parchment, &s;eing the Exemption from that Impo&s;ition can have no Influence on Trade or Manufacturies, and that the &s;aid Duty does affect the Securities of the Subjects E&s;tates, adding likewi&s;e a new Condition, which being omitted may make their Rights and Titles void: And further con&s;idering, that the &s;aid Duty will be unea&s;ie to the People, chargeable in collecting, and of &s;mall value; The Lords Commi&s;|&s;ioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do propo&s;e, That the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> be wholly exempted from the &s;ame, or at lea&s;t that the Exemption from the &s;aid Duties, agreed to by the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>England</HI> in the &s;aid Paper of the 15th In&s;tant, be prolong'd beyond the Year 1710, to a certain Period, as to that Moiety which is impo&s;ed for Perpetuity.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION VI.</HEAD>
<P>And thus after all the Difficulties which were thought Un|&s;urmountable by &s;ome, and endeavoured to be made &s;o by others, the Affair of the Land Tax was &s;ettled; The next Article was the
<PB N="48" REF="143">
Equality of Exci&s;es, Cu&s;toms and other appropriated Funds, and the&s;e had &s;undry Difficulties.</P>
<P>Some were grievous to <HI>Scotland</HI> with re&s;pect to their Magni|tude only, in which ca&s;e tho' <HI>Scotland</HI> was to be &s;uppo&s;ed to pay Duties under the &s;ame Denominations, yet the <HI>Scots</HI> Com|mi&s;&s;ioners pretended to in&s;i&s;t upon it, that they were not able to pay the &s;ame Sums with <HI>England,</HI> but that it mu&s;t be reduced to a proportioned Equality as in the Land Tax, and this re&s;pected the Exci&s;e and &s;everal Branches of the Cu&s;toms.</P>
<P>Others were grievous to <HI>Scotland</HI> in the kind, and were thought Impracticable, at lea&s;t for a time, the Trade, Poverty, and other Circum&s;tances of <HI>Scotland</HI> not admitting them, the&s;e were the Tax upon Malt, and the Exci&s;e, or Duty on Salt.</P>
<P>Others again were &s;uch as were altogether Impracticable, as having none of the Materials to work on in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or &s;uch as could not rationally be expected from them, &s;uch as the Taxes upon Coals, Culm, Hawkers and Pedlars, Hakney-Coach-Men, Births, Burials, and Marriages, Gla&s;s-Windows, Stampt-Paper, and the like.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the Debate on the&s;e Heads, the Equality of Cu&s;toms, Export and Import, with the &s;ame Re&s;trictions and Regulations of Trade was Agreed to by the <HI>Scots</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners; for the nece&s;&s;ity of Commerce made it plain, there could be no adju&s;ting Trade without that. An open free uninterrupted Com|merce by Land being the Con&s;equence of an Union, they would otherwi&s;e ruine the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade, by &s;upplying the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Markets with all &s;orts of Imported Goods, cheaper than the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mer|chants could do; and this would be a mo&s;t de&s;tructive Article in Trade, e&s;pecially in fine Goods. For Example, in Linens from <HI>Ham|borough</HI> or <HI>Holland,</HI> or in Tobacco, Coffee, Tea, Chacolate, and &s;uch other things as were then under large Duty and &s;mall Car|riage; the&s;e would all be &s;pread over <HI>England</HI> by the <HI>Scots,</HI> and make un&s;peakable Confu&s;ions in Trade.</P>
<P>It was the &s;ooner concluded therefore, that the Cu&s;toms, Pro|hibitions, and Charges of all foreign Importations, mu&s;t be nu|merically and literally the &s;ame in both Nations. But as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cu&s;toms were already Impropriated to pay the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Debts, and the <HI>Scots</HI> had before propo&s;ed, that neither Kingdom be burthened with the Debts of the other Contracted before the Union; this Equality was found very difficult; and next to Impracticable, and this brought on the affair of an Equivalent; of which hereafter.</P>
<P>This now run thro' all the Heads of Taxes, for there remained no Que&s;tion, but that an Equivalent was a full Compen&s;ation for any Difficulty propo&s;ed; and yet the &s;ettling an Equivalent here &s;eem'd no Satisfaction. It was alleged an Equivalent was a Na|tional Satisfaction indeed, but not a per&s;onal, that it could not relieve the particular People it Oppre&s;&s;ed, no, nor make good the Damage of the particular Trade it would injure; and
<PB N="49" REF="144">
therefore the <HI>Scots</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;trove hard to avoid the Taxes wholly, rather than to come into them tho' with an Equiva|lent&mdash;, but it was not to be done; there could be no other Method that could make both &s;ides equally Ea&s;y.</P>
<P>After this had therefore been long Di&s;cours'd, the <HI>Scots</HI> Commi&s;&s;io|ners came in to the Article of Equality of Exci&s;es on Liquors, &amp; the Cu&s;toms on Exported and Imported Goods, the Debate of what that Equality was did not ly before them, but &s;eem'd referr'd on both &s;ides to the re&s;pective Parliaments, and there we &s;hall meet with it again at large.</P>
<P>The Cu&s;toms &amp; Exci&s;es on Liquors being thus &s;ettled, the <HI>Scots</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners Excepted again&s;t all other Exci&s;es &amp; Burthens, and in&s;i&s;ted upon it as a Thing <HI>Scotland</HI> was not then in a Condition to come into, at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent, as you &s;ee it expre&s;&s;ed in the Minuts of <HI>May</HI> 13. And it is ob&s;ervable the <HI>Scots</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners made this Propo&s;al with a great deal of Candor and Regard to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as appears by their obviating the Objection which they knew would be made of the Carrying Salt and Malt into <HI>Eng|land;</HI> for it was the particular Duties on Salt and Malt which they had an Eye to in this Propo&s;al, in which they de&s;ired Ex|emption for &s;o much only as &s;hould be con&s;umed in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this occa&s;ion the Committee was appointed to Examine and State the Nature of the Equivalent, and on which particu|lar Articles it was to be allowed; And as this was doing, the Commi&s;&s;ioners in their Meeetings went upon the particular Points of Exci&s;es, or Taxes which were to be objected again&s;t.</P>
<P>The Stampt Paper, the Births, Burials, Windows, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were without much Difficulty conceded to the <HI>Scots;</HI> for as the Cir|cum&s;tances of tho&s;e Duties made them improper, &s;o the Stampt Duties could not have been extended to <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Methods and Cu&s;toms of which would have made it Impracticable in &s;ome Ca&s;es, and Intolerable in others.</P>
<P>The Duties on Coals, Culm, and Cinders, al&s;o occa&s;ioned very &s;mall Debates, the <HI>Scots</HI> being no otherwi&s;e Exempted from tho&s;e Duties, than a great part of <HI>England</HI> is, who pay no Duty for all their River-born Coals; and the Quantity of Coals carried by Sea in <HI>Scotland,</HI> is &s;o very &s;mall as not to de&s;erve any notice; Howbeit all the Coal Exported from <HI>Scotland,</HI> or <HI>Scots</HI> Coal Ex|pended in <HI>England,</HI> pays as in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Births and Burial Act expired, and having been grievous in <HI>England,</HI> it was not probable it &s;hould be Renewed.</P>
<P>The Hakney-Coach-Mens Act could not concern <HI>Scotland,</HI> there being &s;o few Hakney-Coaches in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> as not to make it worth notice.</P>
<P>The Malt and Salt Tax occa&s;ioned the greate&s;t Debate, the Circum&s;tances of <HI>Scotland</HI> were argued, tho' with great Mode&s;ty and Decency, on either &s;ide; and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners were &s;oon made &s;en&s;ible, That, in the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances of <HI>Scotland,</HI> tho&s;e Duties could not be born there.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="145">
And indeed they would have been intolerable to the Poor, and not only as to the Magnitude, but as the manner of Taxing them had been particularly Oppre&s;&s;ive to the <HI>Scots</HI> in their Trade.</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e they are Exorbitant in their Rate, being Charg'd not upon the Value, but upon the Bulk of the Commodity; and the Goods bearing &s;o different a Value in <HI>Scotland</HI> and in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> to put the Duty equal, would be to Tax the <HI>Scots</HI> in three times the Sum they are Tax'd at in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>For Example, the Duty upon Salt is charg'd by Weight in general, and this being Calculated in <HI>Scotland,</HI> would amount to 16 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> Sterling, upon 3 <HI>s.</HI> value, and in <HI>England</HI> to but 16 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> Sterling, upon 10 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> Value, or thereabout; let any Man &s;tate the Proportion, here they will ea&s;ily allow the Tax to be intolerable to the <HI>Scots;</HI> &s;ince by the &s;ame Proporti|on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ought to pay 2 <HI>l.</HI> 17 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> for the &s;ame quantity of Salt, or the <HI>Scots</HI> ought to pay but 4 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d.</HI> for that which by this Tax is rated at 16 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> and the like, tho not in &s;o great a Difference, for the Malt.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Weight of the Salt Tax lyes e&s;pecially on the Poor, who in <HI>Scotland</HI> live very much on Salt Meats, and who&s;e dif|fering Condition from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> does not permit, nor cannot bear being Tax'd at all, much le&s;s equal to the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Arguments brought the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners to agree to an Exemption for a time, the <HI>Scots</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners in&s;i&s;ted upon an Exemption to perpetuity, but the An&s;wer of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;tated in the Minuts of the 13<HI>th May</HI> is very clear, and obliged the <HI>Scots</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners to Acquie&s;ce.</P>
<P>For it could not be thought rea&s;onable to tye up the Hands of the United Kingdom for ever, not to lay on &s;uch Duties or Taxes as the Circum&s;tances of Trade and of the Nation, might make rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>The Treaters on both &s;ides therefore Acquie&s;ced in the Ex|emption from the other &s;everal Duties during the re&s;pective Terms they were given for; leaving the Con&s;ideration of further Exemptions to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, what Alteration this part received, and upon what Con&s;ideration in the Parliament en&s;u|ing in <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;hall appear in its place&mdash;.</P>
<P>There was an Objection offered here about what Duties might be laid on by the very next Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> which being to &s;it almo&s;t at the &s;ame time with the Parliament in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and con&s;equently before the Union could Commence, might alter the &s;tate of the pre&s;ent Duties; And &s;o the Conclu&s;ions might be all to be made over again.</P>
<P>But this was after &s;ome Debate Regulated as <HI>per</HI> the Minuts, by obliging <HI>Scotland</HI> to rai&s;e her part of the Charge of the Year 1707, as u&s;ual, and <HI>England</HI> her part, each &s;eparately and a part, and the &s;everal Duties and Funds mentioned, were to remain ju&s;t as they &s;tood at the time of the Treaty.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="146">
This, and the <HI>Quota</HI> of Land-Tax being brought in together, was readily Agreed to on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>And thus this great Difficulty, which was thought the mo&s;t dangerous in the whole Treaty, was brought into a very narrow Compa&s;s; For the Bu&s;ine&s;s was now, only to &s;tate the matter of the Equivalent, what it &s;hould be, and how to be di&s;po&s;ed.</P>
<P>What it &s;hould be, admitted no long Debate; For, as it was a payment of Money, nothing but Money could be an E|quivalent to it.</P>
<P>How much it was to be, depended upon Matter of Fact, and was re&s;erv'd to exact Calculation from the Foot of the Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;e.</P>
<P>As to the manner how it &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed, the Commi&s;|&s;ioners did not adju&s;t it at all, &s;ave in Generals, of which here|after in its Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>It has been objected indeed, as an Omi&s;&s;ion in the Commi&s;|&s;ioners, That they did not adju&s;t the Application of the Equi|valent in <HI>Scotland;</HI> But their Rea&s;ons were, 1. Becau&s;e they had a Re&s;pect to the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> who were to come after them, and who perhaps might enter farther into that part, and indeed might claim a Right exclu&s;ive of all others to di&s;|po&s;e of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. They were not willing to enter upon a thing, in which the Determination of Properties might be entangled, conceiv|ing it did not ly before them to conclude private Intere&s;ts, or exclude any, <HI>as they might have done,</HI> who had Rea&s;on to claim upon old Debts, &s;ome in King <HI>James</HI>'s Time, and &s;ome in King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Time, and the like.</P>
<P N="3">3. It was thought, this might rai&s;e Objections again&s;t the Union in People, who, being bya&s;s'd by their Intere&s;t, would oppo&s;e the General Intere&s;t on their own particular Accounts.</P>
<P>It was now that the Union appear'd hopeful, and People be|gan to be &s;urprized at the Succe&s;s; The Queen Her &s;elf, plea&s;|ed with the Pro&s;pect, came to the Meeting, and hearing the Minuts Read, Expre&s;&s;ed an Extraordinary Satisfaction in the Steps taken by the Commi&s;&s;ioners, and the Hopes conceived of bringing this Great Matter to a Happy Conclu&s;ion.</P>

<P>And as to the Duty which may be laid on by the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> before the Meeting of the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> for the Service of the Year 1707: The Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>Eng|land</HI> do agree, that the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hall not be charged with tho&s;e Duties, upon this Con&s;ideration, that the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> do make the nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ion for the publick Charge and Service of the Year 1707 in that Kingdom, provided, that if the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> &s;hall think fit to lay a further Charge on the Cu&s;toms, or tho&s;e Exci&s;es, of which the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> have agreed to bear equal Burthens in &s;uch ca&s;es; The Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>England</HI> propo&s;e the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> be ly|able to the &s;ame Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;es, having an Equivalent to be &s;ettled by the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain:</HI> And as to the <HI>Quota</HI> of a Land Tax for the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> propos'd by the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>England</HI> do agree, that whenever the Summe of 1997763 <HI>lib.</HI> 8 <HI>&s;h.</HI> 4&frac12;<HI>d.</HI> &s;hall be enacted by the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> to be rais'd in <HI>Eng|land</HI> on Land, and other things u&s;ually charg'd in Acts of Parlia|ment, for granting an Aid to the Crown by Land-Tax, the King|dom of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hall be charged by the &s;ame Act with the further Summe of <HI>lib.</HI> 48000 as the <HI>Quota</HI> of that Kingdom to &s;uch Tax, and &s;o proportionably for any greater or le&s;&s;er Summe rais'd on the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> by any Tax upon Land, and other things u&s;u|ally charg'd together with the Land.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION VII.</HEAD>
<P>It is very remarkable here, That, in the Exemptions from &s;everal Duties in this Treaty, there is a certain Limitation only to the Act then in Force, and to the Time for which the&s;e Duties were then laid on; From whence &s;ome afterward took Occa&s;ion again&s;t the Treaters on the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;ide, as if they had thereby tacitly con|&s;ented, that tho&s;e Duties &s;hould be charged upon <HI>Scotland</HI> after the Expiration of the Time Limited.</P>
<P>But they that plea&s;e to Examine more Nicely into this Mat|ter, will find it quite otherwi&s;e: The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners con|&s;enting to an Exemption from Taxes to the <HI>Scots,</HI> For, as far as the &s;everal Duties debated were laid, &s;eem'd as much as could rea&s;onably be expected they &s;hould agree to; &s;ince, to have gone farther, had been to abridge the United Parliament that was to follow, and tacitly to acknowledge what was but too frequently &s;ugge&s;ted, that they would be Partial to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and con&s;equently might oppre&s;s the <HI>Scots;</HI> This was the true Mean|ing of that part of the An&s;wer the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners gave to the <HI>Scots</HI> Paper, <HI>May</HI> 18, <HI>viz. But if the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners for</HI> Scotland <HI>would extend their Propo&s;al of the</HI> 13th <HI>to an Exempti|on from all Burthens and Exci&s;es, which the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>may hereafter find nece&s;&s;ary to Impo&s;e on the &V;nited King|dom; The Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners for</HI> England <HI>are of Opinion, That it cannot be &s;uppos'd, the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>will ever lay any &s;ort of Burthens upon the &V;nited Kingdom, but what they &s;hall find of nece&s;&s;ity at that time, for the Pre&s;ervation and Good of the whole, and with due Regard to the Circum&s;tances and Abilities of every part of the &V;nited Kingdom, and to allow of any Suppo&s;i|tion to the contrary, would be to form and &s;et up an unan&s;werable Argument again&s;t the &V;nion it &s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>This was very happily fore&s;een, and by this Method pre|vented; For nothing was more certain, than that this very Argument would be rai&s;ed, and in the debating this Treaty in <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the Parliament there, it was one of the great Pleas, and thought to be an Unan&s;werable Argument again&s;t the Union, <HI>viz. That the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>might and would,</HI> be|ing bya&s;s'd by the Majority of Votes on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ide, <HI>lay Burthens on</HI> Scotland, <HI>without Regard to the Circum&s;tances and A|bility of that part of the &V;nited Kingdom;</HI> And it would indeed have been an Unan&s;werable Argument, if the Lords Commi&s;&s;io|ners had extended their Limitations of Taxes beyond the Ex|piration of the Acts which were then in being.</P>
<P>Therefore they re&s;olved to leave it indefinite, only with their Conce&s;&s;ions, as Rea&s;ons for, and Precedents of future Abate|ments to <HI>Scotland;</HI> And this the Commi&s;&s;ioners of <HI>Scotland</HI> found &s;o rea&s;onable, as that they could not indeed object again&s;t it,
<PB N="54" REF="149">
as to any Duties which the Parliament then in being in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and which were at hand to fit, <HI>viz.</HI> in <HI>October</HI> next follow|ing, it was but ju&s;t to ty them up, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners came readily into that; and thus they went on hand in hand, yielding to one another in every thing which might without Injury be granted, and which might in the lea&s;t contribute to the great and main End of the Treaty <HI>THE &V;NION.</HI></P>
<P>And now they having Clerks appointed to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in the Calculations of the Equivalent, which took up a great deal of Time, they were obliged to adjourn the Affair of Funds, Taxes, Proportion of Debts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and go upon other Articles in the mean time.</P>

<P>The Lords Commi&s;sioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> having already agreed to an Equality of Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;e upon all Exci&s;eable Liquors, and to the &s;ame Regulations of Trade thro-out the whole United King|dom, as a con&s;equence thereof; Their Lord&s;hips do now agree, That the Laws concerning Regulation of Trade, Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;e upon all Exci&s;eable Liquors be the &s;ame in <HI>Scotland</HI> after the Union, as in <HI>England.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION VIII.</HEAD>
<P>The Re&s;erve of Judicatories in <HI>Scotland</HI> being now the De|bate, it is needful only to Explain a few things for the Informa|tion of the Reader, as to the Nature of tho&s;e Judicatories and Re&s;erves.</P>
<P>It was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;erve the Laws, Courts of Ju&s;tice, and Civil or Criminal Judicatories, becau&s;e the re|&s;pective Kingdoms being Govern'd by differing Cu&s;toms, Rites, Laws, and Methods of Ju&s;tice, it would have infinitely Embar|ra&s;t the Treaty now, and the Kingdoms afterward to have made any Alteration: It would have perfectly put a &s;top to all publick Ju&s;tice for a time, and all the Per&s;ons bred to the Law in that Kingdom who had changed their Laws, would have been rendred Unable to Practi&s;e or Di&s;charge their Duty to their Clients, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and have been by con&s;equence dive&s;ted of their Livelyhoods; The&s;e Difficulties appearing &s;o great, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners came readily into it, only with a few Re&s;tricti|ons: As
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That all Laws for the Regulating Trade, Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;es, be the &s;ame in <HI>Scotland</HI> after the Union as in <HI>Eng|land;</HI> This was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be done, <HI>tho' if they &s;hould extend the word,</HI> to all Laws for Regulation of Trade it might be run out to difficult Extremes, &amp; occa&s;ion an unan&s;werable Di&s;pute; but moderately &s;peaking, it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to prevent the confu&s;ion among Officers in Collecting the Revenue, &s;tating and &s;ettling
<PB N="58" REF="153">
the Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;es, which were now to be extend|ed to both Countries.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Again, it was mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary that their other Laws &s;hould <HI>be alterable by the Parliament of Great Britain,</HI> otherwi&s;e this had been to tye up the Hands of the fu|ture Con&s;titution from making nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ion again&s;t whatever Inconveniencies might happen in the Govern|ment; And I mention this here, becau&s;e in the tumultu|ary Clamours rai&s;ed afterwards again&s;t the Treaty, and again&s;t the Treaters, this was one of the great Quarrels, That they had given up the Laws and Con&s;titution of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had &s;ubjected them to the arbitrary Votes of a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, in which it was alledged, the Majority being &s;o much <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> could expect nothing but Di&s;advantage. But it is apparent, and was at the time of the Treaty con&s;idered, that the leaving the Laws of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;ubject to Alteration by the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, &s;ignified no more than leaving room for the Parliament in Ca&s;es of Nece&s;&s;ity, or indeed on all oc|ca&s;ions, to make Laws for <HI>Scotland,</HI> as &s;hould appear need|ful for the publick Advantage, always re&s;erving their general Form of Law and Proceedings of Ju&s;tice, as be|fore; And without this, <HI>Scotland</HI> mu&s;t have been mi&s;e|rably left without a <HI>Legi&s;lature,</HI> and have had no oppor|tunity to have helped her &s;elf in Ca&s;es contingent, or have obtained any more or other Laws for the Rectifica|tion of any of the common Abu&s;es of her Government, which it &s;eems the&s;e Objectors did not think it worth their while to con&s;ider.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>And that this alone was the meaning of this word, <HI>Alterable by the Parliament of Great Britain,</HI> and that it was under&s;tood &s;o on both Hands, is evident from the very words of the Propo&s;al of the <HI>Scots</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners, when they propo&s;e the Alternative between publick and private Right&mdash;, <HI>With this difference be|twixt the Laws concerning publick Right, Policy and Government, and tho&s;e which concern privat Right; That the Laws which con|cern publick Right, Policy and Government may be made the &s;ame thro-out the whole &V;nited Kingdom; But that no Alteration be made in the Laws which conern privat Right, except for evident utility of the Subjects within that part of the &V;nited Kingdom now called</HI> Scotland.</P>
<P>The three next Articles do al&s;o &s;till more evidently Con|firm this, <HI>viz. That the Court of Se&s;&s;ion, or College of Ju&s;tice, do, af|ter the &V;nion, and notwith&s;tanding thereof, remain in all time com|ing within</HI> Scotland, <HI>as 'tis now Con&s;tituted by the Laws of that Kingdom, and with the &s;ame Authority and Priviledges as before the &V;nion; Subject neverthele&s;s, to &s;uch Regulations for the better Ad|mini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice, as &s;hall be made by the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="154">
<HI>That the Court of Ju&s;ticiary do al&s;o, after the &V;nion, and not|with&s;tanding thereof, remain in all time coming within</HI> Scotland, <HI>as 'tis now Con&s;tituted by the Laws of that Kingdom, and with the &s;ame Authority and Priviledges as before the &V;nion; Subject never|thele&s;s, to &s;uch Regulations as &s;hall be made by the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain, <HI>and without prejudice of other Rights of Ju&s;ticiary.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That all other Courts pre&s;ently in Being within the Kingdom of</HI> Scotland <HI>do remain, but &s;ubject to Alterations by the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain; <HI>And that all Inferior Courts within the &s;aid Limits do remain Subordinat, as they now are, to the Supreme Courts of Ju&s;tice within the &s;ame, in all time coming.</HI></P>
<P>Now it was thought mo&s;t Irrational to argue, That the Laws and Con&s;titution of Ju&s;tice in <HI>Scotland</HI> was in this Treaty, gi|ven up to the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> When as, by the&s;e Articles, the Courts of Ju&s;tice, and the General Form of Admini&s;tration, &s;uch as the Se&s;&s;ion, Ju&s;ticiary, and all other Courts, were to remain in Force for ever, or in all time coming:</P>
<P>And yet, as if this had not been enough to &s;ecure the <HI>Scots</HI> from this Fear, the Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> Form the Ne|gative, and in it enter on the Particulars, <HI>viz. That no Cau&s;es in the Kingdom of</HI> Scotland <HI>be Cogno&s;cible by the Courts of Chancery, Queens Bench, Common Pleas, or any other Courts in</HI> We&s;tmin&s;ter <HI>Hall, and that the &s;aid Courts, or any other of the like Nature, af|ter the &V;nion, &s;hall have no Power to Cogno&s;ce, Review, or Alter the Acts or Sentences of the Judicatures within</HI> Scotland, <HI>or &s;top the Execution of the &s;ame.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION IX.</HEAD>
<P>There were &s;ome Debates and a little time &s;pent about the Matter of the Admiralty, but it was &s;oon adju&s;ted, and needs no Remark on it; only as to the Matter of Appeals to <HI>England,</HI> which however were found nece&s;&s;ary, and agreed to with &s;ome little Trouble.</P>
<P>But here had like to have happened a Difficulty about Ap|peals in Cau&s;es of private Right in <HI>Scotland</HI>&mdash;; Before the Union, Appeals in Law lay from the Lords of the Se&s;&s;ion to the Parliament; and the Hou&s;e of Peers of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> being now to be the Sovereign Judicature of <HI>Britain,</HI> there could be no Ap|peals but to them in Parliament: This it was thought would be a Grievance, by Rea&s;on of the Di&s;tance of Place, the Expence of Travelling, and the Charge of Pro&s;ecuting tho&s;e Tryals at the Bar of the Hou&s;e of Peers.</P>
<P>It was Objected, That the <HI>Scots</HI> Peers could not be allow'd to Vote in Matters of Judicature, either in Civil or Criminal Ca&s;es in <HI>England;</HI> and they gave a &s;eeming &s;ub&s;tantial Rea&s;on for it, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Scots</HI> re&s;erving their Judicature, Se&s;&s;ion and Ju&s;ticiary to them&s;elves, in which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have no Voice, it would be unrea&s;onable to de&s;ire the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;hould be let into that in <HI>England,</HI> which is re&s;erv'd from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in <HI>Scot|land.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="162">
But to this it was An&s;wered,<Q>The Lords in <HI>England,</HI> as Peers A&s;&s;embled in Parliament, as they were before the Sovereign Judicature of <HI>England,</HI> would after the Union be together with the &s;ixteen <HI>Scots</HI> Peers, the only Sovereign Judicature of <HI>Britain,</HI> and have their Voices in the Judicature of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as well as of <HI>England</HI>&mdash;; If this be made out, then the Objection again&s;t the <HI>Scots</HI> Noblemen Voting in Judicial Matters in <HI>England,</HI> would by Con&s;equence fall to the Ground.</Q></P>
<P>The Judicature of the Lords con&s;i&s;ts in their trying their own Members for Life, and in Determining the Proceedings of all the other Courts of Ju&s;tice in the Nation; an Appeal going to them from all other Judicatures what&s;oever, whether before or after Judgment.</P>
<P>In Tryals of Peers, 'tis plain by this Union, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lords will have a Vote in the <HI>Scots</HI> Judicature, &s;ince they will have the Power to try all the <HI>Scots</HI> Peers for their Lives or other|wi&s;e, in any Ca&s;e wherein they &s;hall become Obnoxious to the Law.</P>
<P>And as to Appeals, it was therefore ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould ly before the Hou&s;e of Lords, they being the only Supreme Judicature; and to have had Appeals before any other, had been to have two Supremes, unle&s;s Commi&s;&s;ioned by them; And if Commi&s;&s;ioned by them and made certain, they had been too Infe|riour, and al&s;o not to be depended upon in Matters of &s;uch Mo|ment. To &s;olve this Difficulty, a &s;hort Scheme was handed about for the Regulating that Point, &s;o as to Ve&s;t the whole Authority of the Law judicially in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Peers in Parliament, and &s;ettle the E&s;&s;ential Part in them, without neverthele&s;s impo&s;ing the Trouble upon the <HI>Scots</HI> of coming up with their Cau&s;es to the Lords Bar, which would be intolerable.</P>
<P><HI>The Scheme was as follows.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> have now an Appeal from the Lords of Se&s;&s;ion, which are their Judges of A&s;&s;ize, or whatever el&s;e they may call them.</P>
<P>This Right of Appeal mu&s;t not dy tho' the Parliament be|fore whom it lyes is Di&s;&s;olved, but mu&s;t Devolve upon that Power to which as the Center of the whole their Parliament De|volves, <HI>viz. The Parliament of Britain;</HI> Otherwi&s;e &s;hould the Right of Appeal dy, which is one Article of the <HI>Scots</HI> Claim of Right, they endanger their Property, and may upon a Thou|&s;and not unlikely Circum&s;tances Revert to Tyrrannick Power, and even a Parliament may not help them.</P>
<P>The Right of Appeal being not Di&s;&s;olv'd, but Transfer'd to the general Center of Power, where, or on which Branch of that Power mu&s;t it re&s;ide? Not in the Commons, that would be to make them a Court of Judicature, which they to not pretend to, and can not by their Con&s;titution accept.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="163">
Not to the &s;elect Number of <HI>Scots</HI> Repre&s;entatives, that would be to give them more power than the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Repre&s;entatives; one having a judicial Authority, the other not.</P>
<P>Not to a Number cho&s;en by the <HI>Scots,</HI> that would be a new Creation, and be a Re&s;erve of &s;ome Power &s;uperior even to the general &s;upreme power of Parliament, and many ways give Umbrage of a po&s;&s;ibility of Return to a &s;eparate Con&s;titution, which would be really incon&s;i&s;tent with a National Incorporated Union, and capable of keeping on foot continual Jealou&s;ies, Complaints, and Di&s;contents among us, and might &s;ometime or other break out into a Rupture again, and Unravel the very Union it &s;elf.</P>
<P>To regulate this, we mu&s;t fly to one general Maxime, which we mu&s;t adhere clo&s;sly to in all Matters of this Di&s;pute, <HI>viz.</HI> That the great Center of Power whether Civil or Criminal is, and is to be lodg'd in the Parliament then to be called, <HI>The Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain.</P>
<P>The Judicial Power in <HI>Scotland</HI> is immediately in the Se&s;&s;ion, as it is in <HI>England</HI> in the Judges; the Lords of the Se&s;&s;ion in <HI>Scotland</HI> as the Judges in <HI>England,</HI> receive their Commi&s;&s;ions from the Sovereign, and in Her Name, and by Her Authority, tho' by &s;pecial Law obtained in both Kingdoms, they are &s;o fixed as that they can not be turn'd out but upon Misbehaviour.</P>
<P>From the Se&s;&s;ion in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and all Acts, Sentences or Decreets there, lyes an Appeal to the Parliament, who &s;itting in one Hou&s;e are the &s;overeign Judicature of the Nation, as well Commons as Lords; From the Judges in <HI>England</HI> Appeals ly to the Chancery, and from thence to the Hou&s;e of Lords as the &s;upreme Judicature of this Nation.</P>
<P>But both Parliaments being to be Incorporated into one as both Nations by con&s;equence will be one, &s;o the publick Ju&s;tice mu&s;t run in the &s;ame Channel, and the Appeals of both Kingdoms ly before the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Peers only, as that &s;overeign Ocean of Ju&s;tice into which all the Streams mu&s;t flow.</P>
<P>But to the end that <HI>Scotland</HI> may, as far as may be, Eas'd in that Inconveniency, which her di&s;tance from the Capital may bring upon Her, &amp; in which &s;he &s;uffers otherways deeply enough, Appeals from the Courts of Ju&s;tice in <HI>Scotland,</HI> may be tryed in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>A Court of Appeals may be Erected in <HI>Scotland,</HI> delegated from the Peers of <HI>Britain</HI> a&s;&s;embled in Parliament, to be named Annually or Triennially, or every Se&s;&s;ion, or otherwi&s;e, as in the Treaty of Union &s;hall be agreed.</P>
<P>The&s;e Delegates to be Nam'd out of the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility and Gentry, to be cho&s;en by Ballot, or by the u&s;ual way of Voting in the Hou&s;e of Peers.</P>
<P>That they &s;hould be <HI>Scots</HI> is but equal, as they are only to Judge of Cau&s;es in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and is agreeable to the Con&s;titu|tion of <HI>England,</HI> which cau&s;es all Tryals at Law to be tryed in
<PB N="69" REF="164">
the County where the Party dwells, and to be Determined by a Jury of the Freeholders or Inhabitants of that particular County, and of no other.</P>
<P>And yet this does no way le&s;&s;en the Authority of the Parlia|ment, but pre&s;erves the Title of the Lords here to a Voice even in the Supreme Judicature of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>This Scheme as it Entitules the Parliament of United <HI>Britain</HI> to its full and compleat Juri&s;diction; &s;o it pre&s;erves the Right of Appeal to the <HI>Scots,</HI> prevents the Expen&s;ive proceeding of carrying their Appeals to <HI>England,</HI> and takes away all the Force of the Objection again&s;t the <HI>Scots</HI> Noblemen having a Voice in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Judicature.</P>
<P>Thus the Union in point of Judicature may &s;till be compleat, and the general Incorporation not at all Ob&s;tructed, the Cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice left free and open, and both Nations equally concern'd in it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Peers are let into the Sovereignty of the <HI>Scots</HI> Judicature as well as of their own; and the <HI>Scots</HI> let into all the nece&s;&s;ary Privileges which the Right of their Peerage, and the nature of an Incorporated Equality requires.</P>
<P>There were Rea&s;ons to be given why this Propo&s;al was not further entred upon, tho' both &s;ides approved of the Method, &s;ome of which were perhaps &s;uch as the&s;e.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That one &s;ide were willing enough to have all Appeals come to <HI>England.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Others willing to have as few as po&s;&s;ible made at all, and &s;uppo&s;ing that the Inconveniencies of pur&s;uing an Appeal to <HI>England,</HI> would incline People rather to acqui|e&s;ce, and make the Judgment of the Se&s;&s;ion more De|finitive&mdash;. But the&s;e things by the way.</ITEM>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION X.</HEAD>
<P>There was now the only remaining Difficulty of the Union before them, and this was the Con&s;equence of the Third Article, <HI>viz.</HI> The Uniting the Parliament, and how to &s;tate the Propor|tion of the Repre&s;entative was the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The Difficulty was double, not only how to draw the Proportion &s;o, as might con&s;i&s;t with the Equalities &s;poken of before, which were the Foot or Rule of the Treaty, but how to draw it &s;o, as that either Parliament, who were to Confirm this Work, &s;hould be rationally &s;uppo&s;ed to come into it.</P>
<P>Abundance of Schemes were propo&s;ed for this, as Mens Fan|cies guided them, and the Debates without Doors were much warmer, than tho&s;e within; However, as it was a Thing re|quired particular Application, &s;o it was the be&s;t Step that could have been taken, by way of preliminary, to propo&s;e a Confe|rence, wherein both &s;ides had full Scope to deliver their Argu|ments and Rea&s;ons in the Ca&s;e; &s;ince, to have gone on by Propo&s;als and An&s;wers in Writing, would have taken up more time than was needful to be &s;pent in &s;uch an Affair, and have kept it depending; whereas both &s;ides were plea&s;ed with the Hopes, and both the Kingdoms big with Expectation of the Succe&s;s of this Treaty, and the Conclu&s;ion of the long expected Union.</P>
<P>There was no Occa&s;ion to look far back into former Years for Help in this Calculation; There was but one Precedent in the whole World, from which any Scheme could be drawn, and that was in the tran&s;ient Union made by <HI>Oliver Cromwel;</HI> in which, as I have noted before, he brought every thing by a Scale of Proportions to a Point, as things then &s;tood.</P>
<P>This Model of a Repre&s;entative was taken from the Scheme of Proportions, upon which he had formed his Taxation, in which <HI>Scotland</HI> being Rated at about a 13<HI>th</HI> part of the Land Tax, had al&s;o allowed her about a 13<HI>th</HI> part of the Repre&s;enta|tive, as follows;<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>England</HI> was Taxed at 70000 <HI>l. per Men&s;em,</HI> and was Re|pre&s;ented in Parliament by 400 Members.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Scotland</HI> was Tax'd at 6000 <HI>l. per Men&s;em,</HI> and was Re|pre&s;ented in Parliament by 30 Members.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Now abating a few Fractions, which, in dividing Per&s;ons, cannot be exactly ob&s;erved, it is plain, 30 to 400 is very near what 6000 <HI>l.</HI> is to 70000 <HI>l.</HI> as follows;</P>
<P>13 times 30 is 390 Members, and 13 times 6000 <HI>l.</HI> is 78000 <HI>l.</HI> whereas one is 8000 <HI>l.</HI> over in the Money, &s;o the other is 10 under in the Repre&s;entative.</P>
<P>I will not &s;ay, this was the mo&s;t equal Judgment that ever was made of this kind as to <HI>Scotland,</HI> but I may be allowed to &s;ay, that, with Re&s;pect to <HI>England,</HI> it was certainly the mo&s;t
<PB N="73" REF="168">
equal Di&s;tribution of Elections that ever was, and much beyond our pre&s;ent Method; For, in this Scheme, the Di&s;proportion of Numbers was taken away, and the Election of Members to Repre&s;ent Ruin'd Heaps, Decayed Ca&s;tles and Depopulated Towns, was let fall: But of this by the way.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Calculation was not very remote from this in Effect, tho' not built upon the &s;ame Foot; and it was very rational|ly argued here, That the Proportion could not be taken barely from the Share of Taxes paid, which was the Scheme which mo&s;t of the Politicians of that time pretended to go upon; but that the Proportion mu&s;t be doubly calculated, which if it be Exa|min'd, and were to be Applyed in <HI>Holland,</HI> and other parts of the World, mu&s;t have been done.</P>
<P>For In&s;tance the Share in Taxes.</P>
<P>And the Number of the People.</P>
<P>If, on one Hand, the Share of Taxes may be low, yet the Number of People great; or, on the other Hand, the Share of Taxes high, and the People few, the Extremes are to bear their Weight in the Proportion.</P>
<P><LIST>
<ITEM>Thus, tho' the <HI>Scots,</HI> by this Union, paid but 48000 <HI>l.</HI> for <HI>Scotland</HI> to 1997000 <HI>l. Engli&s;h,</HI> which was about 1/40 part, forty times 48000 <HI>l.</HI> being 1920000 <HI>l.</HI> to have argued from thence, That they &s;hould have but 13 Members, which, to the Hou&s;e of Commons, is 1/39 6/13 part of 513: This would appear ridiculous.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Again, if you take an E&s;timate of the People of both Na|tions, we &s;hall find <HI>Scotland</HI> E&s;teemed to contain Two Millions, and <HI>England,</HI> at the highe&s;t Calculation, under Six; and this brings <HI>Scotland</HI> to a Third Part of the Members, which would be Extravagant the other way, and oblige them to &s;end 171 Members to the Hou&s;e.</ITEM>
<ITEM>But, if you &s;et the&s;e Extremes again&s;t one another, it will appear, That a Tenth of the Repre&s;entative An&s;wer'd as nigh to an Equality, as &s;uch a Thing could well be reduced to; and on this Foot, the <HI>Scots</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners were &s;up|po&s;ed to be near the Matter, when they de&s;ired 50 Members might be the Repre&s;entative for <HI>Scotland.</HI></ITEM>

<P>However this was, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners having propo&s;|ed 38, <HI>as by the Minutes,</HI> a Conference was agreed to.</P>
<P>And here the Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;incerely and candidly applyed them&s;elves to one another, debating not only the Rea&s;ons and Proportions on either Hand, but the Temper and Circum&s;tances of either Nation; &s;o, if po&s;&s;ible, to Accommodate them&s;elves to both, and to con&s;ider not only what was equal, but al&s;o what was likely to take place in the Minds of the re&s;pective Parlia|ments, which were to debate it after them; of which none knew the Difficulties better than them&s;elves, neither were the&s;e things fit to have been the Subject of Minutes, which, in time, were to be &s;uppo&s;ed, would be made publick, and be canva&s;s'd

on either &s;ide by the mo&s;t Critical Heads of Two Nations, and particularly by tho&s;e in both the Nations, who&s;e Study it would be to oppo&s;e and ob&s;truct the Union.</P>
<P>And indeed, in this Prudence of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, con&s;i&s;t|ed the be&s;t Pro&s;pect of bringing this Treaty to a Happy Con|clu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Conference was Happy in its Succe&s;s, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Com|mi&s;&s;ioners were convinc'd by the Rea&s;ons given on the other &s;ide, they &s;aw the Difficulties which the <HI>Scots</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners Re|pre&s;ented lay before them; and regarding the End of their Meeting, which was to contribute, as much as in them lay, to Unite the Two Kingdoms, they advanced their Number to 45, and gave their Rea&s;ons and Difficulties on the other Hand, po|&s;itively determining the Point, that they could go no further; Upon which the <HI>Scots</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners, from the &s;ame Zeal for bringing the Treaty, which was now in &s;o Happy a Forward|ne&s;s, to a Conclu&s;ion, acquie&s;ced.</P>
<P>As for the Number of the Peers, there was no Room to de|bate, &s;ince the Number propo&s;ed, which was 16, was a full Pro|portion to the other, &amp; had more of an Equality in it a great deal, than any other part of the Treaty; E&s;pecially con&s;idering, That &s;e|veral of the <HI>Scots</HI> Peers then were Peers of <HI>England,</HI> and hereaf|ter might become Peers of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> by Creation.</P>
<P>And thus this great Difficulty was al&s;o happily got over, and now the Union began to &s;hew it &s;elf, and People on every Hand began to Expect, it &s;hould be Compleated in a few Days.</P>

<P>The Debates about the 16 Peers are &s;o clear, and the Que|&s;tions and An&s;wers in them&s;elves &s;o direct, That they require no Explanation; Nor was there any thing con&s;iderable pa&s;s'd upon tho&s;e Heads, which is not expre&s;s'd in the Minute.</P>
<P>The &s;ettling the different Privileges between the Sitting Peers for the Time being, and the other Peers, &s;eem'd to be the main Difficulty, and was quickly Regulated.</P>
<P>I know it was alledged in <HI>Scotland,</HI> That the Privilege of Peerage being, by this Treaty, extended to the Nobility of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> I mean, as to Protection of their Per&s;ons and E&s;tates, was both a Di&s;honour and a Di&s;advantage to them; A Di&s;honour, as if they were &s;tooping to accept of an Exemption from an Ho|ne&s;t Di&s;charge of their Debts, and a Di&s;advantage, &s;ince now, they being not lyable to Pro&s;ecutions for Debt, would obtain no Per&s;onal Credit, whatever their Occa&s;ions might be&mdash;; And that a private Gentlemans Bond would now be more Valuable than a Noblemans, &s;ince it could be Sued and made Heretable, whereby his E&s;tate &s;hould become lyable, as well after his Death, as in his Lifetime, whereas a Noblemans Bond could no way be put in Suit.</P>
<P>However this was, there was no making a Di&s;tinction, at a time when a Treaty was Tran&s;acting, to bring all, if po&s;&s;ible, to an Equality of Circum&s;tances, unle&s;s the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nobility, &s;hould have laid them&s;elves and their E&s;tates open, to the com|mon Proce&s;s of the Law, which had been Incon&s;i&s;tent with their Con&s;titution, and much more with their Convenience.</P>
<P>I have not meddled with the frequent Propo&s;als, An&s;wers and Replyes about the Salt Tax, as a Thing I &s;hall &s;peak more at large to, when I &s;hall ob&s;erve upon the Minutes of Parlia|ment, where that Matter received a New Turn, and all the&s;e Scruples were effectually &s;ettled under one Head of Limitation, and &s;o are needle&s;s to be Repeated here.</P>
<P>It may be needful to Explain &s;omething here, of the Debate and Re&s;triction about Shipping; The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners had in their View the Act of Navigation, which, in <HI>England,</HI> obliges all the Ships Employed to and from <HI>England,</HI> except only &s;uch Ships as Import any Thing of the Growth or Manu|facture of their own Country, to which tho&s;e Ships belong, to be <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> built Ships, and the Mariners, or Sailers Navigating the &s;ame, to be Two Thirds, at lea&s;t, Natural Born Subjects of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Now as <HI>Scotland</HI> of late Years wanting Timber, or other Ma|terials for Building, had but very few Ships of their own Build|ing, they carryed on the greate&s;t part of their Forreign Trade in Ships built in <HI>Holland, Hamburgh,</HI> the <HI>Baltick,</HI> or other For|reign Parts; Wherefore the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners, in order
<PB N="82" REF="177">
to &s;et Bounds to the Introducing of Forreign Bottoms into our Trade as Free Ships, offered the Clau&s;e as in the Minute.</P>
<P>It was moved in the <HI>Scots</HI> Behalf, to give a certain time for the clearing up this Point, and that a Ship &s;hould be deemed Free at the time of the Union, if part of her was owned by <HI>Scots</HI> Men at the time of the Union, becau&s;e as the <HI>Scots</HI> Traded much to <HI>Holland,</HI> &s;o the Merchants of <HI>Am&s;terdam, Camphere, &amp;c.</HI> were in part Owners, in Company with the <HI>Scots</HI> Mer|chants, of many of their Ships; And therefore it was thought hard, That if the Major Part of the Owners were <HI>Scots</HI> Men, yet the Ship &s;hould be deemed Forreign, which would either oblige the <HI>Scots</HI> Merchant to buy the Remainder, at what Price the Forreign Owner plea&s;ed to Exact, or oblige him to &s;ell and ca&s;t off the Ship, which he could not carry on his Trade with|out.</P>
<P>But as this would have cla&s;hed directly with the Act of Navi|gation, and created innumerable Inconveniencies in Trade, it was left out; For then Forreigners had had no more to do, but to Intere&s;t <HI>Scots</HI> Men in a Moiety of their Ships, and &s;o have made great Numbers of Forreign built Bottoms have pa&s;s'd for Free Ships in <HI>Britain,</HI> to an Inexpre&s;&s;ible Damage of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade.</P>
<P>This Point therefore being given up, it remained only to di&s;pute the time, at which any Ve&s;&s;el belonging entirely to <HI>Scots</HI> Owners &s;hould be deemed Free; The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners put it, to be at the time of Signing the Treaty, the <HI>Scots</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners in&s;i&s;ted on the time of the Commencement of the Union; But the Rea&s;ons given again&s;t that Latitude were &s;o Convincing, that the <HI>Scots</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners Complyed with it.</P>
<P>The principal Rea&s;on was, That, in that Interval of time, the Merchants of either Kingdom might furni&s;h them&s;elves with great Numbers of Forreign Ships, which being built cheaper than the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and becoming Free by this Clau&s;e, would be a great Prejudice to Trade; And &s;eing it was the known Inte|re&s;t of both Kingdoms, to Encourage the Building of Merchants Ships among them&s;elves, it could not but be the Intere&s;t of both, to prevent the Crowding in of Forreign Ships among them.</P>
<P>This was Debated again in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and, after long Di&s;cour&s;es, obtain'd to pa&s;s with this &s;mall Alterati|on, the Time <HI>of Ratifying,</HI> in&s;tead of the Time <HI>of Signing</HI> the Union, as &s;hall appear in its place.</P>
<P>The Affairs of the Standards, Weights and Mea&s;ures, were Things admitted no Debate in either Kingdom, &s;o need no Ob|&s;ervation; I &s;hall give a Scale of the Differences hereafter, be|cau&s;e it may be u&s;eful in Matters of Trade.</P>
<P>The Affair of the Coin made &s;ome Noi&s;e Abroad among the People, but the An&s;wering the Lo&s;s of private Per&s;ons out of the Equivalent put a Stop to it, and it was al&s;o Adju&s;ted with|out any He&s;itation.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="178">
Neither was there any Difficultie before them about the Affair of the Great-Seal of <HI>Britain,</HI> or of any Regulations with re&s;pect to a Seal in <HI>Scotland,</HI> for the pa&s;&s;ing &s;uch Acts, either relating to private Rights or publick Ju&s;tice; but it appeared &s;o equal, that it made no Difficulties, even at the time of the Parliament in <HI>Scotland,</HI> when mo&s;t of the other Heads admitted &s;uch &s;trong Debates.</P>
<P>But the next thing proceeded upon, was the Calculation of the Equivalent, which a Committee had been bu&s;y in &s;ettling, with Clerks appointed to Examine the Calculations, and State them for the Commi&s;&s;ioners, the Re&s;ult of which was now be|fore them.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XII.</HEAD>
<P>In making Ob&s;ervations on the Affair of the <HI>African</HI> Compa|ny, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate that part of the <HI>African</HI> Affair, as belongs to this immediate Debate.</P>
<P>The <HI>African</HI> Company having, as has been related in the beginning of this Work, met with &s;everal Di&s;a&s;ters and Mi&s;|fortunes, in &s;ome of which, the National Intere&s;ts of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> had but too much cla&s;hed, and which had been the Occa&s;ion of a great deal of ill Blood between them, it was
<PB N="86" REF="181">
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, in the bringing to pa&s;s an Union between the Kingdoms, to remove every Occa&s;ion of Di&s;content; and particularly every Interfereing Intere&s;t, being Incon&s;i&s;tent with a compleat entire Union, the Thing now aim'd at, there was therefore an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity to Remove or Reconcile every Thing of that Nature, as far as po&s;&s;ible, before &s;uch an Union could be made.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners were in the right to propo&s;e, That their <HI>African</HI> Company &s;hould be &s;upported and defended as a private Right, all Rights and Privileges of Corporations and Companies being to be Re&s;erved; And this having been a National Concern, in which they had but made an E&s;&s;ay, and mi&s;carrying in their fir&s;t Attempt, had let it re&s;t for a while, but had Various Pro&s;pects of Future Projects and Attempts; It could not be equal, to oblige them to quit the&s;e Pro&s;pects, and their Legal Right to a Trade to the <HI>Indies,</HI> which was &s;o Valuable in other Countries, and which might in Time Re&s;tore their Lo&s;&s;es; and therefore they propo&s;ed the Re&s;erving to them&s;elves the Charters, Rights and Privileges of their <HI>African</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Company.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, the Ca&s;e of <HI>England</HI> made this Impracti|cable; For, whereas there was already a Company E&s;tabli&s;h|ed in <HI>England,</HI> Formed, and, with great Difficulty United in|to One, from two Contending and Powerful Companies; And that the&s;e were entirely &s;upported, and depended upon their Exclu&s;ive Charters, by which no other Per&s;ons could Trade to the <HI>Indies</HI> but them&s;elves, or, by their Permi&s;&s;ion: If this Company E&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>Scotland</HI> had continued after the Union, the Article for a Free Intercour&s;e of Trade between the Nations, had immediately open'd to them all the Ports of <HI>England,</HI> for their Ships and Goods; And it had been, in Event, a perfect laying open the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade, or at lea&s;t Erecting a New <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company in <HI>Britain,</HI> which, whoever knows the Diffi|culty of Uniting the la&s;t Contending Companies, and the Injury they did both their Trade in particular, and the whole Nation of <HI>England</HI> in general, before they could be brought together, will acknowledge, is not to be born within <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>This the <HI>Scots</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners fore&s;aw, and therefore very frankly propo&s;ed the Alternative, <HI>viz. That if the Priviledges of that Company &s;hall be judg'd Inconvenient for the Trade of the Re&s;t of the &V;nited Kingdom, that the private Rights of the &s;aid Com|pany in</HI> Scotland <HI>be purchas'd from the Proprietors.</HI></P>
<P>This was the lea&s;t that could be demanded; For, if <HI>Eng|land</HI> found it Impracticable to &s;uffer, or Intolerable to their Two Companies to bear, it was but rea&s;onable, that the Company, who was to quit its Right, &s;hould have Satisfaction for parting with that Right: And the next Que&s;tion was there|fore, what mu&s;t this Purcha&s;e be, and who mu&s;t pay it, and this was no &s;mall Point.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="182">
<HI>England</HI> was &s;o clear and fair in all their Offers as to the Equivalent, That the <HI>Scots</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners were, in a manner, pre|vented in every thing they had to ask; The Offers of a full Recom|pence in Money, advanc'd for all the Money which <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould be charg'd to pay towards the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Debts, and of applying the whole remaining Revenue of <HI>Scotland</HI> for the Encouraging Trade, and Employing the Poor, had in it &s;o much Evidence of the hearty De&s;ign of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners, to con&s;ider every Thing for the Good of the Community after the Union, That it could bear but little Objection: It &s;eem'd therefore but rea&s;onable, That the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;hould, at their own Charge, put them&s;elves in Condition of Uniting, <HI>That is,</HI> That, if they had any National Ob&s;truction, which was Incon&s;i&s;tent with the de&s;ign'd Union, and without Removing which it could not be made, that then the Removing that Difficulty &s;hould ly at their Door.</P>
<P>It was this kind of Rea&s;oning, which directed the Purcha&s;e of the private Rights of the <HI>African</HI> Company in <HI>Scotland</HI> to be made out of the Equivalent Money; And to which, after very little Debate, as you may &s;ee, both Parties agreed.</P>
<P>Then the Que&s;tion was, What Price &s;hould the&s;e private Rights be purcha&s;ed at; And this would have met with great Difficulties, &s;ome magnifying the Pro&s;pects of their Company in Trade, as a Thing not to be Valued, and which alone was able to Enrich their Nation; Others le&s;&s;ening it in the mo&s;t contemptible manner, as a Thing that not only had now, but never had any Pro&s;pect or Po&s;&s;ibility of Succe&s;s, as it had been managed. Of which by it &s;elf&mdash;.</P>
<P>But the Method propo&s;ed appeared &s;o fair, That it left no Room for Objection, it being a Valuation from the True Origi|nal, <HI>viz.</HI> That every private Adventurer &s;hould be put in the &s;ame Condition as he was in at fir&s;t, &s;uppo&s;ing his Money put out to Intere&s;t&mdash;; So that every Man was to receive his full Original Capital Stock which he had at fir&s;t advanced, and 5 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Intere&s;t to the Time of Payment.</P>
<P>Nor can I forbear &s;aying, That the Surprize of this Offer had Various Effects upon the People; for this Stock was a dead Weight upon a great many Families, who wanted very much the Return of &s;o much Money: It had not only been long di&s;|burs'd, but it was, generally &s;peaking, abandoned to De&s;pair, and the Money given over for lo&s;t; Nay, &s;o entirely had People given up all Hopes, That a Man might even, after this Con|clu&s;ion of the Treaty, have bought the Stock at 10 Pound for an Hundred; And after all this, to find the whole Money &s;hould come in again with Intere&s;t for the Time, was a Happy Surprize to a great many Families, and took off the Edge of the Oppo|&s;ition, which &s;ome People would otherwi&s;e have made to the Union in general.</P>

<P>The main Difficulty, as I have hinted already, was the Propo&s;al it &s;elf of an Equivalent, and indeed without this it had been impo&s;&s;ible to bring this Union to a Conclu&s;ion; Nor was the way ever &s;een clear towards a Union till the project of an Equi|valent was thought of; The Manner of it therefore might con|&s;equently be &s;uppo&s;ed to introduce equal Difficulty, &s;ome pro|po&s;ed it in an Annual payment of Intere&s;t to <HI>Scotland</HI> of <HI>lib.</HI> 30000 <HI>per Annum,</HI> or 600000 <HI>lib.</HI> in Money, to be &s;tated at 5 <HI>lib. per Cent.</HI></P>
<P>But the People that made the&s;e Propo&s;als, built upon the Suppo&s;ition, of the <HI>Scots</HI> Revenues paying a far greater &s;hare of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Debt, than upon a further &s;earch into the &s;everal Articles, appeared probable; and at be&s;t built upon imaginary Encrea&s;es on one &s;ide, and imaginary Expences on the other, as will appear by the following Schemes of the improved Taxes of <HI>Scotland</HI> after the Union.</P>

<P>I &s;hould not Record this Imaginary and Erroneous Scheme, but to illu&s;trate and &s;hew the Nece&s;&s;ity and Original of the True; perhaps the Author of this Scheme had as near a View as any body at that time of Day could come at.</P>
<P>But when the Commi&s;&s;ioners on both &s;ides came to Form them&s;elves into a Committee to &s;tate this &s;o, as that neither Kingdom might object, they found them&s;elves under a Nece&s;&s;ity of keeping a <HI>Medium</HI> between two dangerous Extremes, That the <HI>Scots</HI> on one Hand might not plead a Di&s;parity of Allow|ance, and con&s;equently deny its being an Equivalent, which would overthro' the Foundation; And the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> might not complain they were wrong'd in the Calculation, and paid more for the Proportion than it was worth.</P>
<P>To bring this therefore to a Head, they went back to the Principles, which was an infallible Rule to Judge by, and taking the Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;es of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which were the only Taxes which Could be appropriated to the payment of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Debts, and &s;tating them at the pre&s;ent produce as they were then Farmed out, they advance to the <HI>Scots</HI> as much Money as the annual Produce of tho&s;e Sums appropriated as above comes to&mdash;. This was capable of a mo&s;t exact Calculation to the lea&s;t Fraction, and was exactly ca&s;t up as in the Tables an|nexed to the Minutes, which I have al&s;o Printed, that Po&s;terity may &s;ee how exactly this Matter was carry'd between both, and may for ever be &s;atisfied with the Ju&s;tice which was done them in either Nation.</P>
<P>The Calculation being made exactly for the pre&s;ent Revenue of <HI>Scotland;</HI> It was not for the Commi&s;&s;ioners to attempt a real Advance upon imaginary Encrea&s;es, which might or might not come to pa&s;s, as Trade might or might not be Enlarged by <HI>the &V;nion.</HI> But to remove all po&s;&s;ible Objections, they fir&s;t State how much &s;hall be appropriate to the payment of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Debts, upon every Thou&s;and Pound that any of the Revenues of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hall thereafter advance, and then appointing an exact Account to be kept of &s;uch Advance; Agree, that <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hall be Re-imbur&s;ed by way of Equivalent, as much as &s;hall be paid out of &s;uch advanced Revenues, and that Commi&s;sioners be
<PB N="97" REF="192">
appointed both to &s;ee the Calculations made and Accompts kept, and al&s;o to pay the &s;aid Equivalent as it becomes due.</P>
<P>This was &s;o clear, &s;o ju&s;t, and &s;o unexception'd a Method, that it could admit of no Di&s;pute, and brought the mo&s;t in|tricate part of the whole Treaty to a happy conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Que&s;tion about the manner of payment was now all that remained, and the Propo&s;al for an <HI>Annual</HI> Intere&s;t found no room; for this had been but the &s;ame thing with letting the Revenues of <HI>Scotland</HI> pay them&s;elves as it came in; Nor could it enable <HI>Scotland</HI> to an&s;wer the Incumbrances which were then upon her, and which it behoved her to clear her &s;elf of to make way for the Union, &s;uch as the paying of, or purcha&s;ing the Capital Stock of the <HI>African</HI> Company, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> making good the deficien|cy of the Coin, paying the publick Debts <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>To &s;olve this, the Calculation being made, they propo&s;ed to E&s;timate the Value of the Proportions which <HI>Scotland</HI> would &s;o pay of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Debts, and reduce them to a Rate in pre|&s;ent Money, according to the common E&s;timates then current for advanced payment to the Government; and that then <HI>Eng|land</HI> &s;hould pay the full Sum down in ready Money, the payment to become due upon the &s;igning the Union.</P>
<P>This was thought not only Ju&s;t, but Advantageous to <HI>Scot|land,</HI> and indeed Nece&s;&s;ary to her, to &s;upply the Stagnation which might be upon the current Ca&s;h of that Kingdom on the Alteration of the Coyn, and to cau&s;e Money to circulate among them, which was then much wanted.</P>
<P>This part of the Calculation I have therefore cau&s;ed to be Printed here as it &s;tands in the Books of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, to clear up the Particulars, and to convince the nice&s;t Objectors with what Exactne&s;s and equal proportion every part of this Tran&s;action was carried on.</P>

<P>The Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners for both Kingdoms went from the <HI>Cock|pit</HI> to Attend the Queen at St. <HI>James</HI>'s, where the Lord Keeper, in Name of the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>England,</HI> made the following Speech, and pre&s;ented to Her Maje&s;ty one of the Sign'd and Seal'd In&s;truments or Writings, containing the Articles of Union on the part of <HI>England.</HI><Q><P><HI>May it plea&s;e Your Maje&s;ty,</HI></P><P>WE the Commi&s;&s;ioners Appointed by Your Maje&s;ty, in pur&s;u|ance of the Act of Parliament pa&s;s'd in Your Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> to Treat concerning an Union of the Two Kingdoms, with the Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> do (according to our Duty) Hum|bly beg Leave to pre&s;ent to Your Maje&s;ty the&s;e the Effects of our Continued and Faithful Endeavours towards that End.</P>
<P>They are the Articles agreed upon between Your Commi&s;&s;ioners of both Kingdoms, as the Terms or Conditions, upon which the intended Union is to take place, if Your Maje&s;ty, and the Parlia|ments of both Kingdoms &s;hall think fit to Approve and Confirm the &s;ame.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="198">
In the&s;e we have come to an Agreement on every point, we Judg'd Nece&s;&s;ary to Effect a compleat and la&s;ting Union, and we have En|deavoured not to &s;tir into any Matter we had Rea&s;on to think was not &s;o.</P>
<P>And altho' we have Unanimou&s;ly carried this Treaty thus far, purely from a Conviction, that we have done therein to GOD, Your Maje&s;ty, and our Countries Good Service; Yet we are far from thinking, that what we have done will or ought to be of any Weight or Authority el&s;ewhere; but do mo&s;t entirely &s;ubmit the&s;e our Labours to the High Wi&s;dom of Your Maje&s;ty, and both Your Parliaments, to &s;tand or fall by the Rea&s;on, Ju&s;tice, and publick Utility on which they are founded.</P>
<P>Your MAJESTIES Royal Pre&s;ence and Sea&s;onable Admoni|tions to us at the fitte&s;t Junctures were (we mo&s;t Thankfully Acknowledge) a very great Encouragement and A&s;&s;i&s;tance to us in the Difficulties we met with.</P>
<P>Your Maje&s;ties Glory is already perfect, and the fini&s;hing this Work is all that is wanting to compleat as well as &s;ecure the Happine&s;s of &s;o great a People, as Your Subjects may now without any arrogance pretend to be.</P>
<P>May Your Maje&s;ty Live not only to give a Sanction of this Uni|ver&s;al Ble&s;&s;ing to all Your People, but al&s;o to &s;ee in a long and pro&s;perous Reign over us the many Immediat (or near) Good Effects of it; But as for that great and main Con&s;equence of it, for which Your Maje&s;ty is making by a mo&s;t Gracious and Charitable Fore&s;ight, this only Effectual Provi&s;ion, I mean the continuance of Peace and Tranquility in this I&s;land, upon a de&s;cent of the Crown in&s;tead of that Blood &s;hed and Di&s;traction which would probably follow upon the fatal Divi&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>May we be &s;o happy, as never in our days, to Experiment the fitne&s;s of the&s;e Mea&s;ures your Maje&s;ty is now taking for that end? But may late, very late Po&s;terity only in that re&s;pect reap the Ad|vantage of them.</P></Q></P>
<P>The Lord Chancellor of <HI>Scotland</HI> in Name of the Lords Commi&s;|&s;ioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> made the following Speech, and pre&s;ented to Her Maje&s;ty one of the Sign'd and Seal'd In&s;truments or Writings, containing the Articles of Union on the part of <HI>Scotland.</HI><Q><P><HI>May it plea&s;e Your Maje&s;ty;</HI></P><P>THE Commi&s;&s;ioners appointed by Your Maje&s;ty for the King|dom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to Treat of an Union of Your two King|doms of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> have Commanded me to re|turn Your Maje&s;ty their mo&s;t humble and dutyful Acknowledgments, for the Honour Your Maje&s;ty has Conferr'd on them, in Employing them to Negotiat this mo&s;t important Affair, which is of the greate&s;t Con&s;equence to all Your Maje&s;ties Subjects.</P>
<P>We have endeavoured to di&s;charge this Tru&s;t with all Fidelity, and are now come humbly to lay before Your Maje&s;ty, the Articles and Conditions of Union which we have Treated of, and agreed
<PB N="104" REF="199">
upon, and do &s;ubmit them to Your Maje&s;ties Royal Con&s;iderati|on.</P>
<P>It is a great &s;atisfaction to us, that what we have concluded in this Matter, has been done with Unanimity; and we mu&s;t own, that the knowledge we had of Your Maje&s;ties great Concern for Uniting Your two Kingdoms, and the Earne&s;tne&s;s with which Your Maje&s;ty has been mo&s;t Graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to Recomend it, hath en|abled us to bring this Treaty to a happy and &s;peedy Conclu&s;ion, to the mutual Satisfaction of the Commi&s;&s;ioners on both &s;ides; and we &s;hall e&s;teem it our greate&s;t Happine&s;s, if what we have prepared be acceptable to Your Maje&s;ty, and Ratified by the Parliaments of both Kingdoms, without which, what we have done can be of no Au|thority.</P>
<P>An Union of the two Kingdoms has been long wi&s;h'd for, it be|ing &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for E&s;tabli&s;hing the la&s;ting Peace, Happine&s;s and Pro&s;perity of both Nations; And tho it has been frequently Endea|voured by Your Maje&s;ties Royal Predece&s;&s;ors without the de&s;ir'd Suc|ce&s;s; Yet the Glorious Succe&s;&s;es, with which GOD has Ble&s;&s;'d Your Maje&s;ties Endeavours for the Happine&s;s of Your People, make us Hope that this Great Work is Re&s;erv'd to be accompli&s;hed in Your Maje&s;ties Reign.</P></Q></P>
<P>After which, Her Maje&s;ty was Graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to make the following Speech.<Q><P><HI>My Lords,</HI></P>
<P>I Give you many Thanks for the great Pains you have taken in this Treaty, and am very well pleas'd to find your Endeavours and Applications have brought it to &s;o Good a Conclu&s;ion. The Par|ticulars of it &s;eem &s;o Rea&s;onable, That I hope they will meet with Approbation in the Parliaments of both Kingdoms. I wi&s;h there|fore, That my Servants of <HI>Scotland</HI> may lo&s;e no time in going down to propo&s;e it to my Subjects of that Kingdom; And I &s;hall always look upon it as a particular Happine&s;s, if this Union (which will be &s;o great a Security, and Advantage to both Kingdoms) can be Accompli&s;h'd in my Reign.</P></Q></P>

<HEAD>OF THE Carrying of the TREATY in SCOTLAND.</HEAD>
<P>AND thus the Treaty at <HI>London</HI> ended, which, tho' it &s;eemed very perfect in all its parts, and as abundance of People thought, could not want any Corrections, yet as by the &s;equel appeared, the mo&s;t difficult Work was yet to do.</P>
<P>I know &s;ome were of the Opinion, that this Treaty could admit of no Additions, Amendments or Alterations, and that the Words in the re&s;pective Acts of Parliament previous to it, (which &s;aid, <HI>Provided that nothing in this Treaty &s;hould be binding to either Nation, unle&s;s it &s;hall be Ratified in the re&s;pective Parliament of both Kingdoms</HI>) Implyed that the re&s;pective Parliaments had no Power to enter into the Articles &s;eparately and apart, but only debating on the whole, to Approve or Di&s;approve, Ratifie or Reject it as a Treaty.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not Trouble the Reader with any of the Rea&s;ons given for this Notion, nor make any other Remark upon it than this,&mdash;That the People who were for this Opinion were of two &s;orts, and both &s;uch as the Nations on either &s;ide, were very little behol|ding to.</P>
<P N="1">1. They were &s;uch, who having no great Concern for the e&s;&s;ential part of the Treaty, <HI>viz. The Good of their Country,</HI> were for taking all upon Tru&s;t, and concerned not them&s;elves either with the Event, or with the Circum&s;tances, and therefore without any Dif|ficulty were willing to put all upon a meer plurality of Voices, not much regarding whether it went this way or that. I &s;hall be Kinder to the&s;e Gentlemen than to Record their Names, or leave them (&s;o eminent in Folly) to be known by Po&s;terity, le&s;t their Children &s;hould be told hereafter how little their Country was obliged to them.</P>
<P N="2">2. The other &s;ort, who&s;e Follies ought equally to be concealed, I mean as to Naming them, were &s;uch who were willing to have them put to the Que&s;tion in Gro&s;s; Pre&s;uming,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That either their being &s;o Voted, would hand them down Clogg'd with &s;o many Inconveniencies as would in Time force the Nations to break the Articles, or bringing them to the nece&s;&s;ity of falling to pieces, the Treaty &s;hould Di&s;&s;olve of Cour&s;e. Or,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That being Voted in general, with &s;o many apparent Dif|ficulties as they pretended to &s;ee in them, they would infallibly be lo&s;t in this Parliament, and &s;o as formerly, the whole Treaty come to nothing.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="213">
That the&s;e People aim'd not at &s;hortning the Labour, but at cutting off the Union it &s;elf, is manife&s;t, and it was but too appa|rent afterwards; &s;ince Debates, and that in every Article; by which they plainly made it appear, that they did not argue &s;o much to Rectify and Amend as to De&s;troy, not &s;o much to make the Articles more Perfect, or more Explicit, more Advantagious, or more Satisfying, but to annihilate them as Articles, and di&s;&s;olve the very Life and Being of the Treaty: And this appeared in that, thro' all the Debates that happened afterwards, they &s;hew'd them&s;elves equal|ly again&s;t every Article, and at the &s;ame time that they Objected again&s;t things, very &s;eldome concern'd them&s;elves, to propo&s;e the Alternatives, but rather pu&s;ht at overthrowing the &s;ub&s;tance of the thing; and if po&s;&s;ible, to Urge the mo&s;t Nece&s;&s;ary Articles as Im|practicable and Incon&s;i&s;tent.</P>
<P>As on the one Hand, this di&s;covered the De&s;ign of the Per&s;ons to be <HI>not Amending,</HI> but De&s;troying the Articles: So it manife&s;tly expo&s;ed their Ignorance, either of their own Strength in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or of the Strength of their Friends in the South, in both which parts, (had their weak Politicks prevailed to have put the Treaty in general to a Vote) they would have lo&s;t it by a Majority of Voices, the generality of both Nations being fully Convinc'd of the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of a Union, and would rather have Voted it without the Amendments than have lo&s;t it.</P>
<P>If I am ask'd how I prove this, I think I have a very good Foundation for it.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. In the Motions fir&s;t made in the Parliament Hou&s;e in <HI>Scot|land, November</HI> 1. 1706, when the strength of the Hou&s;e, as they call it, was effectually Tryed.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. It was Moved that the Parliament now proceed to the farther and more particular Con&s;ideration of the Articles of the Union, in order to Approve them or not.
<P>&rindx; Nota, <HI>The Articles had been Read and Di&s;cour&s;ed on &s;everally in the Hou&s;e, and had taken up &s;ixteen Days, barely Reading them one by one, to hear what one another could &s;ay, and to give the Members Light into the particulars,</HI> viz. <HI>from the fifteenth of</HI> October, <HI>to the fir&s;t of</HI> November.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Upon this fir&s;t Motion another followed, <HI>viz.</HI> That the farther Con&s;ideration of the Union be yet delayed for &s;ome con&s;iderable Time, that the Sentiments of the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> thereanent be known, and that the Members of Parliament may Con&s;ult tho&s;e they Repre&s;ent.&mdash;<HI>Vide</HI> the Minuts of Parliament, <HI>Numb.</HI> 13. But neither of the&s;e Attempts could be Carried in the Hou&s;e, nor could they bring the Moti|on to a Vote in the Terms the Propo&s;al was made, <HI>viz.</HI> Of Con&s;ulting Con&s;tituents, or waiting till the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament &s;hould Sit.&mdash;To both which I &s;hall &s;peak in their Turn.&mdash;I only mention it here, to &s;how that it was apparent the&s;e Motions proceeded only from a de&s;ire to gain Time, which they
<PB N="3" REF="214">
thought might furni&s;h a variety of Accidents to di&s;appoint the whole.&mdash;And the many weak Attempts and low Steps &s;ome Gentlemen took, if po&s;&s;ible, to delay the proceedings, plainly &s;hew'd the very juncture of Time when this was doing, was one of the greate&s;t Unhappine&s;&s;es, <HI>as they thought it,</HI> which befell the Party.</ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. But I prove this further by the Unanimity of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Par|liament in pa&s;&s;ing the Treaty, and Ratifying without any Amend|ment, what they thought they had Clogg'd with &s;o many Inequa|lities, on the other &s;ide, that it could never go down with them.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I &s;hall further convince the Reader of the manife&s;t De&s;ign of the Party again&s;t the Union, <HI>as &s;uch,</HI>&mdash;from their frequent Attempts to Clog the Articles with &s;uch Things as they knew it was impo&s;&s;ible the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> could grant&mdash;as a Liberty to Export Wool, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> different Draw-backs, and different Prohibitions in Trade, differing and di&s;proportioned Exci&s;es, Cu&s;toms and Taxes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of which I &s;hall take the Freedom to &s;peak in their Turn.</P>
<P>But being di&s;appointed in the&s;e, they found the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> &s;o Unanimous that they pa&s;t all their Amendments, &s;ome of which were &s;uch, as the Party having meerly Clamour'd the Hou&s;e into, were really pa&s;t, not &s;o much for any Re&s;pect to their true Signification, as for the &s;ake of giving &s;ome Satisfaction to Unea&s;ie People.</P>
<P>How much more then the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> would have pa&s;t the whole Treaty Unaltered, is very evident, and con&s;equently 'tis as plain that the&s;e People had taken no aim in their offering to Vote the Articles in the gro&s;s, upon a Pre&s;umption that it would be a mean to make the whole mi&s;carry.</P>
<P>The Treaty being concluded in <HI>England,</HI> and the Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;eparated; The next thing was the Meeting of the re&s;pective Par|liaments of the two Kingdoms for Ratification of the Articles.</P>
<P>The Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> was fir&s;t, being to meet the third of <HI>October</HI> 1706.&mdash;The Queen was Repre&s;ented in this Parliament by the Duke of <HI>Queensberry.</HI>&mdash;I know 'tis not the part of a Hi&s;torian to make Panegericks, and I think I have given Demon&s;trations to the World, as to my &s;elf, that I will flatter no Man&mdash;But I cannot but give this Te&s;timony here, that the Prudence, Calmne&s;s, Temper and Moderation of this Noble Per&s;on had the&s;e two vi&s;ible Effects.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. It gave a wonderful Te&s;timony to the Queens Judgment, and the right Notions &s;he had entertained of the true &s;tate, not of Her Affairs only, but of Her People; that Her Maje&s;ty knew this Work mu&s;t be carried on, not by too much Fire or too much Water, neither by want of Zeal or too much Zeal, That here was an in&s;olent Party to deal with, who mu&s;t be born with, not Exa&s;perated, Calm'd not Enraged; That here would be as much Difficulty required to deal with Friends as with Enemies, to Reconcile Jarring Intere&s;ts, Cla&s;hing Parties, and keep all in Temper.&mdash;Here was a &s;trong Party for the Union,
<PB N="4" REF="215">
but they were made up of &s;everal Parties, ju&s;t come together as for the Occa&s;ion; They were like <HI>Epicurus</HI>'s Attoms by a &s;trange fortuitous Chance of concurring Circum&s;tances brought to joyn in this, who were perfect Antipodes in all their former mea&s;ures, and could never agree to act together before; It was not a Matter of the lea&s;t Con&s;equence to bring together and keep to|gether, &s;trong and differing Parties, who acted even in this very Thing, from different Views, and &s;ome with directly contrary De&s;igns,&mdash;and it was all the way as Fatiguing to keep &s;ome Gentlemen in &s;uited Temper, for this great Work, as to oppo&s;e the Fire and Fury of tho&s;e that &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t it.&mdash;Under the &s;olid Con&s;ideration of all this, and with a full view of the Difficulties, at lea&s;t in general, Her Maje&s;ty pitches upon the Duke of <HI>Queensberry,</HI> as a Per&s;on of Temper, Prudence and Moderation, unexceptionable in Knowledge of what was before him, re&s;olute in pur&s;uing it thro' all Difficulties, and of a calm Courage in all the pa&s;&s;ive part of it, of which I &s;hall &s;peak more at large hereafter.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. It had this particular Advantage, that it was in a great Mea&s;ure the only thing that carried this difficult Work on, That the Duke in all the Heats and Animo&s;ities of the Party, in all the Convul&s;ions of the Kingdom, carried on the Treaty with Ea&s;ine&s;s, Temper and extraordinary Conduct, not taking Advantages of the Ra&s;hne&s;s and Rudene&s;s of the People, Pity|ing rather than apprehending Danger from their Folly, he kept his hand upon the Work, his Eye upon the principals of the Oppo&s;ite Party, he di&s;appointed all their Mea&s;ures, he let him&s;elf into the Darke&s;t of their Coun&s;els,&mdash;he pur&s;ued the main and great Work in hand,&mdash;and with a Contempt, above my power to expre&s;s, received all their In&s;ults, laught at their Threatnings, Treated them Courteou&s;ly and Calmly, under the mo&s;t intollerable Carriage,&mdash;and this under the &s;upream Conduct, was the only Step by which this great Work could have been brought to pa&s;s.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Had warmer Heads been li&s;tned to, had Re&s;entment been pre|vailing, had Provocations, almo&s;t beyond the power of Fle&s;h and Blood to bear, been prevailing,&mdash;<HI>and I mu&s;t own, who was an Eye Witne&s;s to it all, that I often wondred how it was po&s;&s;ible to bear &s;uch things;</HI> I &s;ay, had the Gentlemen of Warmer Heads been li&s;tned to, nay even with &s;trong Rea&s;onings, and from Men of &s;ound Judgments too,&mdash;all had been undone, and the Nation had been in a Flame, we had been de&s;troyed not delivered, the Government had been di&s;&s;olved, not United, and <HI>Britain</HI> had by this time been the Seat of Blood, not an United and pro&s;pering Nation.</P>
<P>But this by the way, the Parliament being to meet, Her Maje&s;ties high Commi&s;&s;ioner ha&s;tned down to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Queen on all Occa&s;ions, expre&s;&s;ing Her Hopes that this Treaty would come to a happy I&s;&s;ue.&mdash;It was generally expected it would be received with the &s;ame Chearfulne&s;s and Alacrity in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and all our Eyes were bent upon the Meeting of the Approaching Parliament.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="216">
In this general Expectation, I cannot forbear hinting here, that my Curio&s;ity pre&s;t me to take a Journey thither, and being by all my Friends, to whom I communicated my De&s;ign, encouraged, to think I might be u&s;eful there to prompt a Work that I was fully convinced was for the general Good of the whole I&s;land; and particularly nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;trengthning the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t, I was moved purely on the&s;e Accounts to undertake a long Winter, a Chargeable, and as it proved, a Hazardous Journey.&mdash;</P>
<P>I contemn, as not worth mentioning, the Sugge&s;tions of &s;ome People, of my being imployed thither, to carry on the In|tere&s;t of a Party.&mdash;I have never loved any Parties, but, with my utmo&s;t Zeal have &s;incerely E&s;pou&s;ed the Great and Original Intere&s;t of this Nation, and of all Nations, I mean Truth and Liberty,&mdash;and who ever are of that Party, I de&s;ire to be with them.</P>
<P>However, by this Journey, I had the Opportunity of Seeing and Hearing all the Particulars of the following Tran&s;actions, and of u&s;ing my be&s;t Endeavours to An&s;wer the many, many, and I mu&s;t &s;ay of &s;ome of them, the mo&s;t frivolous and ridiculous Objections, formed and improved there with great Indu&s;try, again&s;t every Article of the Union; and this is my Rea&s;on for mentioning it here, that I may acquaint Po&s;terity how I came to the Knowledge of what I Write, and for no O&s;tentation at all: And as I had the Honour to be frequently &s;ent for into the &s;everal Committees of Parliament, which were appointed to &s;tate &s;ome difficult Points relating to Equalities, Taxes, Prohibitions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 'Tis for tho&s;e Gentlemen to &s;ay, whether I was u&s;eful or not, that's none of my Bu&s;ine&s;s here; but by this means I have the greater A&s;&s;urance to relate the Circum|&s;tances and Fact as it &s;tood before them, and can not be afraid of being detected in any material Mi&s;take.</P>
<P>And as this is the Rea&s;on of my making any mention of my &s;elf, &s;o the Reader cannot but be content to know, from what Foundation this Relation is handed down to Po&s;terity, and what a&s;&s;urance he has that the Author he Reads was Capable of giving him a right &s;tate of the Matter.</P>
<P>I have hinted already with what Freedom the Scriblers of the Age, if I may give them that Title, took upon them in the begin|ing of this Affair, to Determine what &s;ort of Union was proper to be Treated of, and every one having vented his Politicks this way and that way, as his Intere&s;t or Party, or particular Imployer Dictated, we thought that Storm had been over; when the Parliament fir&s;t Sat down in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the generality of People &s;eem'd very ea&s;y and forward for a Union in general, as what had long indeed been the de&s;ire of the whole Nation; and therefore the &s;trange Alienation of the Humours of the People, on the general part of it, was the more Wonderful, and the more Unexpected: Of which, and its Cau&s;es, I am now to &s;peak; of the Effects I &s;hall be more particular hereafter.</P>
<P>On the third of <HI>October</HI> the Parliament met, his Grace Her Maje&s;ties High Commi&s;&s;ioner opened the Se&s;&s;ion according to the u&s;ual Forms.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords and Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE your la&s;t Meeting, We did Nominat Commi&s;&s;ioners to Treat of an Union betwixt Our two Kingdoms of <HI>Scot|land</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> and by their great Care and Diligence, a Treaty, is happily concluded and laid before Us.</P>
<P>We have called You together as &s;oon as Our Affairs could Per|mit, That the Treaty may be under Your Con&s;ideration, in Pur|&s;uance of the Act made in the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of Our Parliament there; and We hope the Terms will be acceptable to You.</P>
<P>The Union has been long De&s;ired by both Nations, and We &s;hall E&s;teem it as the greate&s;t Glory of Our Reign to have it now Perfected, being fully per&s;waded, That it mu&s;t prove the greate&s;t Happine&s;s of Our People.</P>
<P>An intire and perfect Union will be the &s;olid Foundation of la&s;ting Peace; It will &s;ecure Your Religion, Liberty and Proper|ty, remove the Animo&s;ities among&s;t Your Selves, and the Jea|lou&s;ies and Differences betwixt Our two Kingdoms: It mu&s;t in|crea&s;e Your Strength, Riches and Trade, and by this Union the whole I&s;land being joyned in Affection, and free from all Ap|prehen&s;ion of different Intere&s;ts, will be enabled to Re&s;i&s;t all its Enemies, &s;upport the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t every where, and main|tain the Liberties of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>We do upon this Occa&s;ion Renew the A&s;&s;urances We have formerly given You, of Our Re&s;olution to maintain the Govern|ment of the Church, as by Law E&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Acts of both Parliaments, upon which this Treaty proceeded, having re&s;erved their re&s;pective Governments of the Church in each Kingdom; the Commi&s;&s;ioners have left that Matter Entire; and you have now an Opportunity for doing what may be nece&s;&s;ary for Security of Your pre&s;ent Church Government after the Union within the Limits of SCOTLAND.</P>
<P>The &s;upport of our Government, and your Own Safety does Re|quire, That You do make nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ion for Maintaining the Forces, Ships and Gari&s;ons, until the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> &s;hall provide for the&s;e Ends in the United King|dom.</P>
<P>We have made choice of our Right Tru&s;tie, and Right Entirely Beloved Cou&s;in and Coun&s;ellor, <HI>James</HI> Duke of <HI>Queensberry,</HI> to be Our Commi&s;&s;ioner, and Repre&s;ent Our Royal Per&s;on, being well &s;atisfyed with his Fitne&s;s for that Tru&s;t, from the Experience We have of his Capacity, Zeal and Fidelity to Our Service, and
<PB N="7" REF="218">
the Good of his Countrey; which, as it has determined Us in the Choice, We doubt not but will make him acceptable to You.</P>
<P>We have fully In&s;tructed him in all things We think may fall under Your Con&s;ideration, and &s;eems to be nece&s;&s;ary at pre|&s;ent: Therefore We de&s;ire that you may give entire Tru&s;t and Credit to him.</P>
<P><HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>It cannot but be an Encouragement to You to Fini&s;h the Union at this Time, That GOD Almighty has ble&s;&s;ed Our Arms, and tho&s;e of Our Allies with &s;o great Succe&s;s, which gives Us the nearer Pro&s;pect of a happy Peace, and with it You will have the full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the Advantages of this Union; and You have no Rea&s;on to doubt but the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> will do what is nece&s;&s;ary on their part, after the Readine&s;s they have &s;hown to remove what might ob&s;truct the entering on the Treaty. We mo&s;t earne&s;tly Recommend to You Calmne&s;s and Unanimity in this Great and Weighty Affair, That the Union may be brought to a happy Conclu&s;ion, being the only effectual Way to &s;ecure your pre&s;ent and future Happine&s;s, and to Di&s;appoint the De&s;igns of Our and Your Enemies, who will doubtle&s;s on this Occa&s;ion, u&s;e their outmo&s;t Endeavours to Prevent or Delay this Union, which mu&s;t &s;o much Contribute to our Glory, and the Happine&s;s of Our People; And &s;o We bid You heartily Fare|well. <HI>Given at Our Court at</HI> Wind&s;or Ca&s;tle <HI>the thirty fir&s;t Day of</HI> July 1706, <HI>and of Our Reign the Fifth Year.</HI></P>

The Treaty has, with all Humility, been pre&s;ented to the Queen, and was mo&s;t Graciou&s;ly received; and tho' no Reign was ever &s;o truly Great, for Wi&s;e and Steady Councils, and &s;o many Important Succe&s;&s;es, as that of Her Maje&s;ty; yet, you &s;ee, She is plea&s;ed to E&s;teem the Perfecting of this Union, as the greate&s;t Glory of Her Reign, being the mo&s;t &s;olid Founda|tion of a la&s;ting Security to the Prote&s;tant Religion, and the Liberties of <HI>Europe,</HI> and of Peace and Happine&s;s to Her People.</P>
<P>The&s;e Rea&s;ons, I doubt not, will make the Treaty acceptable to You; And I per&s;wade my &s;elf that you will proceed with &s;uch Calmne&s;s and Impartiality, as the Weight of the Subject Requires, and as becomes &s;o great an A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>The Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners for both Kingdoms were Limited in the Matter of Church Government; For the Security of Pre&s;|byterian Government in this Church, you have the Laws already made for its E&s;tabli&s;hment, the Queens Repeated A&s;&s;urances to pre&s;erve it, and I am Impowered to Con&s;ent to what may be further nece&s;&s;ary after the Union.</P>
<P>Her Maje&s;ty has been plea&s;ed to Recommend to You to make Provi&s;ion for the Forces, Ships and Gari&s;ons, which is very nece&s;&s;ary, the Sub&s;idies granted at Your la&s;t Meeting being run out; &s;o, I doubt not, You will &s;peedily Renew them.</P>
<P><HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>I am not in&s;en&s;ible of the Difficulties that attend the Weighty Character, it has plea&s;ed Her Maje&s;ty to Honour me with, but with your favourable A&s;&s;i&s;tance, (upon which I very much Rely) I hope, by my Zeal and Fidelity for Her Maje&s;ties Service, and the Good of my Countrey, which are in&s;eparable, to Di&s;charge my Duty on this extraordinary Occa&s;ion.</P></Q></P>
<P>And this was followed with another Speech by the Earl of <HI>Sea|field</HI> Lord Chancellor of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which I have al&s;o in&s;erted here, as follows<Q><P><HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>IT hath been, and is the great Happine&s;s of this Nation, That the Queen Our Sovereign, hath always made it the chief De&s;ign of Her Reign, to protect Her Subjects, in the Enjoy|ment of all their Rights and Privileges, to Promove their Good, and to E&s;tabli&s;h their Peace and Pro&s;perity, upon &s;ure and la&s;ting Foundations.</P>
<P>For the&s;e Ends, Her Maje&s;ty, in Her mo&s;t Gracious Letter, doth, with great Earne&s;tne&s;s, Recommend to You the Conclu|ding of the Union of the Two Kingdoms, and has plainly and
<PB N="9" REF="220">
fully laid before You the great Advantages that this Union mu&s;t bring with it to all <HI>BRITAIN,</HI> and in particular to this King|dom.</P>
<P>The Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners Named by Her Maje&s;ty for this Kingdom to Treat of this Union, have endeavoured to Di&s;|charge this great Tru&s;t, with all Fidelity, and have Agreed to &s;uch Terms and Conditions, as, I hope, &s;hall be found Ju&s;t, Honourable and Advantageous: The Treaty has been already received very Graciou&s;ly by Her Maje&s;ty, and is now ready to be Reported to you for your Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>I do not think it proper at this time to de&s;cend into the particular Articles of the Treaty; I &s;hall only beg leave to &s;ay in general, That it mu&s;t be of great Advantage to have this whole I&s;land Unite under one Government, and Conjoyned Intirely in Intere&s;t and Affection, having Equality of all Rights and Privileges, with a free Communication and Intercour&s;e of Trade, which mu&s;t certainly E&s;tabli&s;h Our Security, Augment Our Strength, and Increa&s;e Our Trade and Riches.</P>
<P>We can never expect a more favourable Juncture for Com|pleating this Union, than at pre&s;ent, when Her Maje&s;ty has not only Recommended it, but Declared, That She will E&s;teem it the greate&s;t Glory of Her Reign, to have it perfected; And when the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> has &s;hown their Inclinations for it, by Removing all the&s;e Ob&s;tacles that did ly in the way of the Treaty: And it mu&s;t al&s;o be acknowledged, that the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>England</HI> did Te&s;tify their good Di&s;po&s;ition all along in this Affair: And the Great and Glorious Succe&s;&s;es wherewith GOD has Ble&s;&s;ed Her Maje&s;ties Arms, and tho&s;e of Her Allies, give us the Hope of a Near and Advantageous Peace, whereby we will be put in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and attain to the full Enjoyment of all the Liberties and Privileges of Trade, now offered by the Treaty.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners of both Sides, have only Treated of &s;uch Things as concern the Civil Government, Liberties, Privileges, Trade, and Taxes; but found them&s;elves Limited as to the Church-Government, that being Re&s;erved to each Kingdom by the re&s;pective Acts of Parliament, upon which the Treaty pro|ceeded: And you have now not only the Laws already made, with Her Maje&s;ties mo&s;t Gracious Repeated A&s;&s;urances, for maintaining and continuing Presbyterian Church-Government within this Kingdom; But this further Opportunity of making &s;uch Conditions and Provi&s;ions, as &s;hall be found Nece&s;&s;ary for its Security, after the Conclu&s;ion of this Union, within the Li|mits of <HI>SCOTLAND.</HI></P>
<P>Her Maje&s;ty Recommends to You to provide the nece&s;&s;ary Sup|plies for the Troops, Gari&s;ons and Ships; The Funds formerly given are expired: And therefore I doubt not, but you will ea&s;ily comply with what is &s;o plainly Nece&s;&s;ary for the Pre&s;erva|tion of the publick Safety, and preventing the De&s;igns of Ene|mies now in time of War.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="221">
<HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>Since We have now the Opportunity of E&s;tabli&s;hing for Our Selves and Our Po&s;terity, by this Union with <HI>England,</HI> all that concerns Our Religion and Liberties, together with the mo&s;t valuable Privileges of Trade; I am hopeful, that You will proceed to the Con&s;ideration of the Articles of the Treaty, in &s;uch manner as &s;hall bring it to the de&s;ired Conclu&s;ion, and it cannot but tend to the la&s;ting Honour of this Se&s;&s;ion of Parlia|ment, to have &s;o happily fini&s;hed this mo&s;t Important and Weigh|ty Matter.</P></Q></P>
<P>I choo&s;e to place the&s;e Speeches here, rather than in the <HI>Appen|dix,</HI> becau&s;e they &s;o immediatly relate to the Story, and to the Con|tinuance of the Thread of the Story, which now comes to be Di&s;|cour&s;ed of, that I thought they could not be &s;o properly Tran&s;po&s;ed.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not enter here into the particular Vote of every Day, hav|ing Ab&s;tracted tho&s;e things by way of Journal, in another part of the Work, with Notes upon them, drawn from my own Ob&s;ervation, and from the generous A&s;&s;i&s;tance of many Honourable Gentlemen pre&s;ent in the very Occurrences of every Day, and of Impartial Un|bya&s;&s;ed Judgment in the Affair it &s;elf;&mdash;But one thing I mu&s;t remark here, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing the Hou&s;e did, after the Speeches above, was to call for the Treaty of the Union, as it was drawn up and &s;igned by the Commi&s;&s;ioners,&mdash;and having cau&s;ed it to be Read in the Hou&s;e.&mdash;Upon &s;ome general Debate, which la&s;ted not long, it was Ordered to be Printed, and Copies to be Delivered to the Members of Parliament, which was accordingly done.</P>
<P>Till this very Day all things had gone on well, and the Peo|ple in general were very well plea&s;ed with the Thoughts of the Union&mdash;They had not yet had Subject for the Turbulent Spirits to work upon, and having in general only Di&s;cour&s;ed upon the Advantages of both &s;ides, which were indeed in them&s;elves vi&s;ible enough,&mdash;the Clamorous Party which followed had not Concerted their Mea&s;ures, from what Topicks to work upon the Humours of the People.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner then were the Articles Printed, and put into the Hands of the People,&mdash;but the Gentlemen, who &s;et them&s;elves up again&s;t them, began to Preach upon the general Heads, as their Humour and Talent in&s;tructed them, in order to po&s;&s;e&s;s the People again&s;t the Particulars.</P>
<P>I cannot but di&s;tingui&s;h here between the &s;everal parties that now oppo&s;ed the Union: In my Ob&s;ervation there were Four &s;everal &s;orts of People, who were again&s;t this Treaty, and who, either within Doors, or without, either in Parliament, in Commi&s;&s;ion, or in Conver|&s;ation, joyned to Oppo&s;e, Clamour at, or Object again&s;t the Union;
<PB N="11" REF="222">
and 'tis really nece&s;&s;ary here to di&s;tingui&s;h of them, that when I talk, <HI>as I &s;hall have frequent Occa&s;ion in the Proce&s;s of this Story,</HI> of the Oppo&s;ers, and the Parties Oppo&s;ing, it may, by the man|ner of their Oppo&s;ing, be di&s;tingui&s;ht who is mean't; For I &s;hall not name Per&s;ons in my Di&s;cour&s;e of tho&s;e things, not think|ing it nece&s;&s;ary to make this Hi&s;tory a Satyr upon any one Family, or Record to Po&s;terity the Steps they took in particular, or their Rea&s;ons for it in this Affair.</P>
<P>Where particular Actions, more than ordinary publick, have di|&s;tingui&s;hed Per&s;ons, that is their own Act and Deed, and lyes not at my Door; But to come to the Heads of Parties.</P>
<P N="1">1. There was the profe&s;t <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party who Oppo&s;ed the Treaty, purely on the Account of the Succe&s;&s;ion, which they &s;aw evidently was &s;truck at, and would be effectually fixt, contrary to their Prin|ciples, and Eternally Exclu&s;ive of the Family they Adhered to; And the&s;e Declared their Aver&s;ion to the Union, upon all Occa&s;i|ons, publickly and fairly, and, for ought I know, were &s;ome of the hone&s;te&s;t of the Enemies to the Treaty.</P>
<P N="2">2. There was the Diffenters from the Church, or the Epi&s;copal Party, the&s;e Oppo&s;ed the Union al&s;o publickly, as it tended in its Con&s;equences, entirely to &s;ettle the Presbyterian E&s;tabli&s;hment, for ever to fore-clo&s;e them, and bar the Door again&s;t all po&s;&s;ibility of their Recovering the Government of the Church in the manner they de&s;ired; Since they &s;aw but too plainly, however blind others were to it, that this Treaty would &s;o &s;ettle the Presbyterian E&s;ta|bli&s;hment in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and &s;o fortify it by Law, that if ever they &s;hould attempt to Recover the Hierarchy of Epi&s;copacy here, even the very Epi&s;copal Church, their own Brethren in <HI>England,</HI> would be obliged to Oppo&s;e and Suppre&s;s them.&mdash;And the&s;e, &s;o far as they acted fairly, were hone&s;t and open Enemies al&s;o to the Union.</P>
<P N="3">3. There was a mi&s;taken People, <HI>I hope I may &s;ay &s;o much of my own Opinion without Offence, for truly I think them mi&s;taken,</HI> who, tho this Union was calculated entirely for their Safety, and tended to their indi&s;&s;oluble E&s;tabli&s;hment, as by the Alarm of their Enemies was very vi&s;ibly demon&s;trated, yet were drawn in by their Fears, and, I doubt, tho&s;e Fears too much inflam'd by the Policy and wick|ed Artifice of Whi&s;perers and di&s;gui&s;ed Enemies, to Oppo&s;e the U|nion, as dangerous to the Church, and as interfereing with the &s;e|veral publick Engagements the Nation had entered into.&mdash;The&s;e, or mo&s;t of them, were Hone&s;t, Well-meaning, and &s;ome of them mo&s;t pious and valuable People; However &s;ome of them might &s;in a|gain&s;t Moderation in the manner of their Di&s;&s;enting, and a little too warmly pu&s;h on their private Opinions.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e People I &s;hall be far from &s;aying any thing &s;evere, for indeed I cannot think any thing ill of them, I mean as to Inten|tional Evil. The Weakne&s;s any of them might di&s;cover in for|warding, countenancing, or giving a Name to the Di&s;orders of the Times, was rather the Artifice of a Party, who eneavoured to En|flame the Nation, and put the Appearance of it upon them, Writ|ing
<PB N="12" REF="223">
their Names upon every Action, and Intituling every Tumult to their Protection.</P>
<P>But de&s;cending to particulars, we &s;hall find; that however forward, and if their Enemies de&s;ire it, I'll venture to &s;ay, Indi&s;creet &s;ome of them might be, in di&s;covering their Sentiments with Warmth in Conver&s;ation, yet upon all publick Occa&s;ions their whole Oppo&s;iti|on of the Treaty was confin'd to legal Applications and peaceable Endeavours, the Tumult at <HI>Dumfries</HI> only excepted; For as to that of <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> it was wholly <HI>Jacobite,</HI> meer Rabble and Tumult of that Party, and the poor Blinded Commonality Deluded and Impo&s;ed upon by them, contrary to the Opinions, and without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the People I am &s;peaking of, as will appear hereaf|ter.</P>
<P N="4">4. But la&s;tly, There was a Party, who Vigorou&s;ly and Violently, by all manner of Artifice, Trick, and Underhand Dealing, Oppo&s;ed this Union, meerly upon Politick <HI>Enigmas,</HI> Rea&s;ons of Party, found|ed upon State Principles, Ambition, Emulation, Party-Pick, Pre|judices, and a va&s;t variety of unhappy Conjunctions, as &s;erv'd to Enflame and Agitate their Spirits again&s;t it.&mdash;And as the&s;e were many of them Gentlemen of the fir&s;t Rank, and &s;ome of them other|wi&s;e even well enough Affected to both the Succe&s;&s;ion, and to the Church; So I &s;hall &s;how more Re&s;pect to their Per&s;ons, than to Record them in a Ca&s;e which I promi&s;e my &s;elf, they will &s;ome time or other reckon it their Misfortune to have Oppo&s;ed, and per|haps be as Zealous now its fini&s;hed to pre&s;erve, as they were before it was fini&s;hed, to prevent.</P>
<P>Yet I mu&s;t Confe&s;s, it was to the&s;e Gentlemen we owe the Amu|&s;ing the Nation with &s;o many unhappy Prejudices, the Alarming them with &s;uch ungrounded Apprehen&s;ions, and the Embarking the Common People again&s;t it, meerly on the appearing of &s;uch Men in it, on who&s;e Judgments, and on who&s;e Quality they had &s;o much Dependence.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the Fatal People again&s;t this Treaty, the&s;e &s;truggled within Doors and without, the&s;e brought to pa&s;s that mon&s;trous Conjunction of Oppo&s;ite and Di&s;cording Parties, and brought the <HI>Jacobites</HI> to cry out for the Succe&s;&s;ion, the Epi&s;copal People to want Security for the Presbyterian Church, the Tory to cry out, Breach of Covenant, and the well Minded Presbyterian ignorantly excite the People to a Rabble.</P>
<P>The&s;e went about Preaching Oppo&s;ition in every Shape, ju&s;t as it &s;uited the People they had to do with, they undertook to join <HI>Came|ronian</HI> and Per&s;ecutor; Presbyterian and Papi&s;t; Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion and <HI>Jacobiti&s;m;</HI> Parties as Oppo&s;ite as the Elements, as Di&s;tant as the <HI>Poles;</HI> And the&s;e are the People I de&s;ire to be under&s;tood of, when in this Book I talk in general of the Oppo&s;ers of this Uni|on, I Name no Body, whoever the Coat fits, they are Welcome to wear it.</P>
<P>Having thus de&s;cribed the Parties, it would be endle&s;s to enter into their &s;everal Methods, by which they Concurr'd together, <HI>I do</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="224">
<HI>not &s;ay Confederated,</HI> for that was Impracticable, their &s;everal Aims con&s;ider'd; But all concurr'd neverthele&s;s, to put the Manage|ment of this Affair into the following Confu&s;ions.</P>
<P>Till the Printing of the&s;e Articles, as I have already noted, the People were generally very de&s;irous of the Union, as a thing which tended to the putting an end to all former Animo&s;ities, bury|ing the ancient Feuds between the Nations, and removing the Ap|prehen&s;ions good People on both &s;ides had ju&s;tly entertain'd of a new Rupture, in ca&s;e of the Queens Demi&s;e.</P>
<P>But no &s;ooner were the&s;e Articles printed and di&s;pers'd, but as if every Body had &s;et them&s;elves to rai&s;e Objections, form Scruples, and find Faults in them, the whole Nation fell into a general kind of Labour, in Canva&s;&s;ing, Banding, and Cavilling at the Conditions.</P>
<P N="1">1. The poor People were terrifyed with the Apprehen&s;ions of in&s;upportable Taxes, Lo&s;s of Imployment, Want of all Things, and large Payments upon their Salt and Malt.</P>
<P>They were again filled with &s;trange Stories of being &s;old to the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> their Parliament, Crown, Scepter, and even their Name as a Nation to be lo&s;t, and all carryed to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Merchants were frighted with printed Schemes of Exce&s;|&s;ive Cu&s;toms and Impo&s;itions, and the &s;trange&s;t Projects of Trade were &s;pread about the Kingdom that ever were &s;een, which being gotten into the Heads of tho&s;e People, who yet, by their Concern in Trade, one would have thought, in common Charity, &s;hould have known better, were &s;o managed, that it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to believe, &s;uch prepo&s;terous Notions could prevail upon People, o|therwi&s;e Knowing enough; Such as, 1. The Profitablene&s;s of a Trade to <HI>France,</HI> tho all the Returns from thence was in peri&s;hable Goods, &s;uch as Wines, Brandy, and Trifles for Con&s;umption at Home.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Unprofitablene&s;s of a Trade to <HI>England,</HI> whither their Export of Cattle and Linen, amounting to above Two Hundred Thou&s;and Pound <HI>Sterling per Annum,</HI> brought back very little but ready Money.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e were &s;trange things, but &s;o popularly pu&s;h'd on, that they amu&s;ed the whole Nation, and the poor People were told, the Uni|on would beggar the Country, and &s;tarve the Nation; And this talk'd up to an Extravagant Height, made the poor perfectly di|&s;tracted.&mdash;Taxes were calculated, without allowing for the Ad|vantages of the Cu&s;toms, in other Ca&s;es taken off, without con&s;ide|ring the Taxes on Malt and Salt were remote, and probable never to be laid, without con&s;idering Proportions, Equalities, and the Rea&s;ons, Nature, or Nece&s;&s;ity of things, that the poor People were Exa&s;perated to the highe&s;t Degree, and fill'd with Apprehen&s;ions, that they &s;hould have neither Food to eat, nor Beer to drink, that they were ju&s;t to be &s;acrificed to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> be &s;ubdued, ruin'd and de&s;troy'd.</P>
<P N="3">3. Tho&s;e Articles, which left &s;ome things Contingent to the Par|liamentary Juri&s;diction, were improved to per&s;wade the People, that
<PB N="14" REF="225">
all their Laws, Liberties, E&s;tates, and whatever was near and dear to them, was left intirely to the Determination and ab&s;olute Di&s;|po&s;al of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament; In which, they being to have but a &s;mall Repre&s;entation, &s;uppo&s;ing their own Members to be always Unbya&s;s'd and Impartial, they &s;hould always be Over-ruled, Out|voted, Oppre&s;s'd and Subjected: To talk to them, in this Ca&s;e, of the Words <HI>&V;nalterable</HI> and <HI>Perpetual,</HI> was to &s;ay nothing; To &s;ay, the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament could make no Alterations, was to &s;ay nothing. The&s;e things had &s;o filled the Heads of the People, that nothing could pacify them.</P>
<P N="4">4. But above all this, and which was yet mo&s;t unhappy, as it tended to an univer&s;al Alarm, and to Embark a great many Sober and well Affected People again&s;t it, it was carefully repre&s;ented to be Dangerous to the Church Government, That all the E&s;tabli&s;h|ment would be &s;ubjected to a Vote of Parliament, and a Parliament, where the Prelates had a Voice again&s;t them; that if the Bi&s;hops &s;hould plea&s;e to Vote Epi&s;copacy into <HI>Scotland,</HI> they getting a Majo|rity in the Parliament, it would be done; that the Church would be ruin'd; that if &s;he obtain'd a Tolleration, it was the mo&s;t that could be expected in this Ca&s;e, and that was precarious and uncer|tain, and what they mu&s;t come a begging to the Bi&s;hops for. This made an un&s;peakable Di&s;order in the Minds of the People, and all the Methods taken to convince them, that the Parliament could not encroach upon the Church, or any ways concern them&s;elves about it, were to no purpo&s;e; they declared the Act of Security to be in&s;ufficient, railed at the <HI>Scots</HI> Parliaments con&s;enting in blank to the E&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and inveighed again&s;t a Tolleration of Epi&s;copacy here, which they &s;aid would be the Con&s;equence.</P>
<P N="5">5. And la&s;t of all came an Univer&s;al Cry, that this was a plain Breach of the National Covenant and Solemn League, by which the Nation had bound them&s;elves by Oath to GOD Almighty, among other things, to endeavour the pulling down the Epi&s;copal Hierar|chy, and to Reform, to the utmo&s;t of their Power, the Church of <HI>England</HI> al&s;o.&mdash;All the&s;e things were not only brought as Argu|ments, but pu&s;h'd with &s;o much Heat, &s;o much want of Charity and Courte&s;y, that really it began to break all good Neighbourhood, it &s;owred all Societies, and the National Quarrel broke into Families, who were ever jangling, divided, and oppo&s;ite one among another.&mdash;Nor was there any offering the Expo&s;itions, no not of their own Di|vines, who had declared, that the Obligations of the Covenant intitul|ed them to no other Endeavour of Reforming the Church of <HI>England,</HI> but &s;uch as con&s;i&s;ted in Prayers, Exhortations, Chri&s;tian Arguments and Examples, <HI>Vide</HI> Doctor <HI>Rule</HI>'s <HI>Vindication of the Church of</HI> Scot|land, <HI>P.</HI> 16. However there was no talking to the People at this Time, nothing but Patience and Time could be expected to remedy it.</P>
<P>In this Juncture, and if po&s;&s;ible to compleat the Di&s;tracti|ons of the People, one Gentleman, by Name Mr. <HI>Hodges,</HI> and who had formerly been &s;uppo&s;ed to write for the Common Good of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> and was rewarded for it by Parliament, by what Fate, Party,
<PB N="15" REF="226">
Pa&s;&s;ion or Prejudice, remains to this day a Doubt,&mdash;writes a large Book again&s;t an Incorporate Union; In which he abu&s;es and reproaches <HI>England,</HI> as a Faithle&s;s, Wicked, Treacherous and Abo|minable Nation, and that to Unite with her, was to Entail GODs Judgment on <HI>Scotland</HI> for her National Sins. A &s;ad In&s;tance of the Temper of the&s;e Times.</P>
<P>In this Book he &s;ets down Two and Thirty Interfereing Intere&s;ts between the Nations, which he pretends 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to re|concile: 'Tis writ with Infinite Scandal and Fal&s;ity; and among the re&s;t, and as a Te&s;t of the Sincerity of the Party, he affirms the&s;e palpable Untruths.<LIST>
<ITEM>1<HI>&s;t,</HI> That in Commerce, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> is carryed on in Exclu&s;ive Companies, by which, the letting the <HI>Scots</HI> into that Trade, was an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cheat.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That all the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical State of the Church was left at the Mercy of a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That the Members of Parliament in <HI>England</HI> were obliged to take the Sacrament of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> before they were admitted to &s;it in the Hou&s;e.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>This is not a place to confute the&s;e things, they did not want their An&s;wer in their Sea&s;on, and the People in time did be|gin to &s;ee their Error, and how this Author had, by manife&s;t For|gery, impo&s;ed upon them.&mdash;But &s;till this did the Mi&s;chief it was calculated for, before any An&s;wer could take place; for this Book was eagerly e&s;pou&s;ed by the Party, and there was no room to que|&s;tion it was writ at their private Appointment: It was indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread over all the Kingdom in a few days, and no Body of any Con|&s;ideration but had a &s;ight of it; nay, it was handed about among the poor People, to &s;tir them up and enflame them, and it had all the Suc|ce&s;s the wickede&s;t Creature could wi&s;h for; It confounded and amaz|ed the People, the dark Side of every thing was &s;hown them, and the true Sen&s;e of things concealed, and who can but think the People thus abu&s;ed &s;hould run out into Extravagancies.</P>
<P>It is not &s;o much, that a Book fraught with Ab&s;urdities, Fal&s;i|ties and Contradictions, merits a Note in this Work: But I think 'tis ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to &s;hew where the general Di&s;affection at the Union began, &s;ince it was manife&s;t, that, till this time, the People were, in general, very well &s;atisfyed, and the Pro&s;pect of an Union was very grateful to them.</P>
<P>It cannot but be &s;ome Satisfaction to all tho&s;e who have heartily e&s;pou&s;ed this Union, that the Oppo&s;ition had &s;uch a beginning; that its Foundation was laid in the Party-Prejudices of a few, who&s;e Refuge and Support was the meer A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Fal&s;ities and unpa|rallel'd Forgeries, by which the poor ignorant People were amu&s;ed, impo&s;ed upon, and led blindly on, even to the Brink of their own De&s;truction; from whence, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> the good Providence of GOD re&s;|cued them, yet they were &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, that they flew in the Face of every Body that attempted to open their Eyes, and in&s;ulted their Deliverers.</P>

It was at lea&s;t a Fortnight, that the Heats of the People, on Ac|count of the&s;e Articles, continued, before they produced any extra|vagant Effects, and this time was generally &s;pent in the Parliament, in reading over, di&s;cour&s;ing upon, and preparing to Debate the Articles.</P>
<P>For it may be noted, as will appear by the Minuts, that the Ar|ticles were read over one by one in the Hou&s;e, before the main read|ing of them, and the Members were admitted to &s;peak freely their Opinions on every Head, but to put nothing to the Vote.</P>
<P>During this Work, which was from the third of <HI>October</HI> to the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> the Ferment increa&s;ed, and the whole Kingdom &s;eemed to be in a Di&s;order, &s;ome Accounts of which may be very proper here.</P>
<P>There had always been a &s;trong Oppoition in this Country to the pre&s;ent Settlement, both Eccle&s;ia&s;tical and Civil, and the Revo|lution was not e&s;tabli&s;h'd without a Civil War, which, tho it was but &s;hort, came to a Deci&s;ive Battel, which had this particular &s;eeming Contradiction in it, that the Kings Army lo&s;t the Battel, and got the Victory.</P>
<P>The Vi&s;count of <HI>Dundee,</HI> formerly <HI>Graham</HI> of <HI>Claverhou&s;e,</HI> headed the Malecontent Party, the Kings Forces were routed, but <HI>Dundee,</HI> unhappily for his Party, was found among the Slain: His Victo|rious Party, by his Death, not only lo&s;t the Advantage of their Victory, but having lo&s;t the Chief of their Army, they &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed for want of a Head, and the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment prevailed.</P>
<P>But &s;till they left the North Highlands full of Di&s;affection to the pre&s;ent Government, never &s;ubmitting, but, as it were, by meer Force, even to this Day.</P>
<P>All the Remains of this Party, called particularly the <HI>Jacobite,</HI> were unanimou&s;ly again&s;t the Union, as they were again&s;t the Suc|ce&s;&s;on.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Epi&s;copal Party were again&s;t it as before, becau&s;e they fore|&s;aw, that the Presbyterian Church would &s;trengthen their Settlement, by the Addition of <HI>England,</HI> who by this Treaty, would on all Occa&s;ions, be obliged to &s;upport and defeud them, and &s;o the Party would of Cour&s;e be finally excluded.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Parties &s;aw them&s;elves abandoned by tho&s;e who for|merly oppo&s;ed the Succe&s;&s;ion on different Rea&s;ons, and that tho&s;e Gentlemen had fallen into the Union, as is before hinted; And tho I will not &s;ay, that they and the Papi&s;ts and <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party were all in an Intere&s;t before, yet it was manife&s;t they fell in together now, unanimou&s;ly to oppo&s;e the Union.</P>
<P>What Oppo&s;ition they had formerly made was under Hand, partly by Solicitation of Friends, and Cla&s;hing of Parties; they al|ways look'd on it as a thing remote and impracticable, and a thing which the con&s;tant Jarrs, they indu&s;triou&s;ly promoted among the People, and particularly the National Antipathy would always prevent.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="228">
But when, contrary to their Expectation, they found, That the Union was brought to a Head in <HI>England;</HI> That the Court pu&s;h'd heartily to bring it to a Conclu&s;ion; and to their great Surpri&s;e found the &s;everal Oppo&s;ing Parties joyn'd together; and that every one, from what different Pro&s;pects &s;oever, concurr'd in the Union, and &s;eem'd to make their Court to the Times on the Foot of the Zeal they &s;hould &s;how for this new Pro&s;pect of Settlement.</P>
<P>This exceedingly alarm'd them; and they found, That now or never was the time to oppo&s;e it; That if it obtain'd now upon the Humour of the People, it was certain to be fini&s;hed, and they and their Cau&s;e effectually fore-clo&s;ed, from all Hopes of ever retrieving their Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner therefore was the Parliament met, and the Eyes of al the Nation fix'd upon the Event of this great Affair, but all the Engines of the &s;everal Parties were &s;et to Work: Some to Expo&s;e, &s;ome to Defend both the Proceedings that were already perfected in <HI>England,</HI> and tho&s;e that were now entring upon.</P>
<P>Innumerable Pamphlets were printed and di&s;pers'd over the whole Kingdom; and indu&s;triou&s;ly Harrangu'd upon by the Engines of the re&s;pective Parties, as their Intere&s;ts led them.</P>
<P>The next Step was to find out popular Arguments to gratify the Humours of the &s;everal Orders or Divi&s;ions of the People; and to alarm them with tho&s;e things in particular, which their &s;everal Tempers, Parties, or De&s;igns led them mo&s;t to apprehend.</P>
<P>Thus they &s;pread all po&s;&s;ible Scandals and Satyrs again&s;t the Trea|ty in general, as well in Print as in Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>As that it was Di&s;honourable to <HI>Scotland;</HI> Surrendering her Sove|reignity and Con&s;titution, Subjecting her to her Ancient and Im|placable Enemies.&mdash;That it was Depre&s;&s;ing the Honour and Dig|nity of a Kingdom, that had Defended her Liberty again&s;t <HI>England</HI> with &s;uch Gallantry and Bravery, for &s;o many Hundred Years, as if &s;he was le&s;s able to Fight now than ever, her Sons le&s;s Bold, her Gentry le&s;s Daring, or le&s;s willing to Die for their Country; That now they were to be Slaves, and mu&s;t run to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> to Vote with a Handful of Members, who would never be able to carry a Que&s;tion, or to make any Weight there, but ju&s;t for Forms &s;ake &s;it in the Hou&s;e, and be laugh'd at.</P>
<P>That the Figure <HI>Scotland</HI> would make in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, would not be like a Kingdom, but like a Province; That one County in <HI>England. viz.</HI> of <HI>Cornwall</HI> &s;ent up as many Members, one ex|cepted, as the whole Kingdom; and that this was an Eternal Badge of their Subjection, and the like.</P>
<P>This was a general Cry, and began to be very popular: The Peo|ple cryed out they were <HI>Scots</HI> Men, and they would be <HI>Scots</HI> Men &s;till; They contemn'd the Name of <HI>Britains,</HI> fit for the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> Men, who were made the Scoff of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> after they had reduc'd them.&mdash;<HI>Scotland</HI> had always had a Name and a Fame in Forreign Courts; They were Naturalized in <HI>France,</HI> Enjoy'd for many Years great Pri|vileges there, and Honours bought with the Blood of their Ance&s;tors;
<PB N="18" REF="229">
and they would never give away their Birthright, tho &s;ome of their Nation had been driving a Bargain for them&s;elves, at the Price of Selling their Country.&mdash;Thus they fill'd the Mouths of the common People, who would go about the Street crying, No Union, and call the Treaters Traitors, and &s;oon after began to threaten them openly to their Faces.</P>
<P>The Succe&s;s the Party obtain'd here to incen&s;e the common People was too much, not to encourage them to proceed; And the next Step was, to infu&s;e like Prejudices into the Heads of the &s;everal Par|ties and Per&s;wa&s;ions of People. And this was divided into two.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To per&s;wade the Hone&s;t Presbyterian, that the Church would be &s;ubjected to the Votes, the Power and the Oppre&s;&s;ion of the Epi&s;copal Hierarchy in <HI>England.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I will not po&s;itively a&s;&s;ert, that this was a meer <HI>Jacobite</HI> Chime|ra, or had its pure Original in Plot and De&s;ign; The Fears and Ap|prehen&s;ions of Hone&s;t People might at fir&s;t lead them a great way in that Ca&s;e: But I believe no Body will take Offence if I &s;ay tho&s;e Fears and Apprehen&s;ions were &s;oon made a Handle by this Party, who &s;at ready to take all Occa&s;ions, and they immediatly rai&s;ed a Cry; That the Church was betray'd; That Epi&s;copacy was coming in upon them; That in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament they &s;hould be &s;ubjected to the Plurality of Voices, in which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bi&s;hops, be&s;ide their Influence on the Nobility and Gentry, had al&s;o their own Voices: And that, if the Union ever went forward, they &s;hould be certainly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the Prelates, and reduced to a Tolleration at be&s;t, if perhaps that &s;hould be obtained.</P>
<P>I cannot be cen&s;ur'd by any Body, in this Conclu&s;ion of mine, if it be remembred, what &s;trange Advocats the Church had at this Time,&mdash;when tho&s;e that never came to the Church, never owned the Juri&s;diction of the Church; but on the contrary, were always known to maltreat her, reject her E&s;tabli&s;hment, and never joyned with her, either in Doctrine or Di&s;cipline, Wor&s;hip or Government, went up and down, Exclaiming at the De&s;igns of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bi&s;hops, to overthrow the E&s;tabli&s;hed Church.</P>
<P>Nor will it be remote to the purpo&s;e to ob&s;erve, that when the Act for the Security of the Church came to be Debated in Parliament, tho&s;e very Gentlemen appear'd Zealous to obtain larger Condi|tions, and Voted the Overture in&s;ufficient for the Churches Safety, who were never &s;uppo&s;ed to owe the Church &s;o much good Will or ever before were ob&s;erved to make her Security any part of their Con|cern: Nay, nor were ever known &s;o much as to joyn with the Church, owne her Di&s;cipline, or call them&s;elves Members.&mdash;But this cea&s;ed to be a My&s;tery, when &s;ome of tho&s;e Gentlemen hone&s;tly de|clared, this was only done to &s;trengthen their Intere&s;t again&s;t the U|nion, and openly began to draw their Arguments into a Chain of Succe&s;&s;ive Nece&s;&s;ities; That, from the very <HI>Papi&s;t</HI> to the <HI>Jacobite,</HI> the <HI>Prelati&s;t,</HI> the <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> the <HI>Cameronian,</HI> every one might find Rea&s;ons to Act together again&s;t the Union, as a Common and a National Evil. But of this I &s;hall find Occa&s;ion to &s;peak again pre&s;ently.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="230">
The early &s;preading the&s;e Prejudices had but too much Succe&s;s; the Party applyed them&s;elves, as they found it &s;uit the <HI>Genius</HI> and Tempers of the People.</P>
<P>To &s;ome it was Fatal to the Church, and they would be &s;ubject|ed to Prelacy, and the Plurality of Votes in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament.</P>
<P>To others it was Dangerous to the State, and the Independency, Honour and Sovereignity of the Kingdom was betray'd and given up.</P>
<P>Nay to the very Children and mo&s;t ignorant People, they had their Arguments; &s;uch as, That the Honours, as they call them, the Crown of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Sword and Scepter, &s;hould be carryed away to <HI>England;</HI> And the Boys and Mob were invited by a great Per&s;on, in a Melancholly Tone, to go in and &s;ee the Ancient Crown of <HI>Scotland,</HI> for that it would &s;oon be carryed away, and they might never &s;ee it any more.</P>
<P>To others they had a more &s;ubtil Argument; which tho it was perhaps begun among tho&s;e that had no ill in their De&s;ign, <HI>as is &s;aid of the fir&s;t,</HI> yet they carefully improved this, as they did all other things, to the general Confu&s;ion of the Times: And this was a Notion, that it was ab&s;olutely again&s;t the National Cove|nant, in which the People had Sworn to two Things, which this Treaty directly would contraveen and render impo&s;&s;ible.<LIST>
<ITEM>1<HI>&s;t,</HI>&mdash;That <HI>Scotland</HI> had Sworn in the National Covenant, to &s;upport the Sovereignity of the Kingdom, which they &s;aid was now to be given up.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That <HI>Scotland</HI> had engaged to pull down Epi&s;copacy in <HI>England,</HI> to the utmo&s;t of their Power.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The &s;tarting the&s;e two things had two fatal Pro&s;pects; which indeed, had they not been both over-ruled by that Secret Hand, which had &s;ingularly appeared in the carrying this Treaty on thro' &s;o many &s;eemingly in&s;uperable Difficulties, might have involved both Nations in Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>From the fir&s;t of the&s;e, they pretended to be bound to pre&s;erve the State in its immediate &s;eparate Condition; as if Confederating with, and Joyning to a more powerful Nation, on Terms Honourable, and tending to &s;upport the Sovereignity and Power of the whole, was not con&s;i&s;ting with that part of the Covenant; which could no otherwi&s;e be under&s;tood there, than to &s;ignify the Supporting and Defending the Con&s;titution of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as it was or &s;hould be legal|ly E&s;tabli&s;h'd.</P>
<P>As to the other Sugge&s;tion, it was effectually An&s;wer'd by one of the mo&s;t Learned Divines of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Doctor <HI>Rule;</HI> where he Explains the Meaning of the Covenant to be in that Ca&s;e, no Attempt by Force to reduce the Church of <HI>England, &amp;c.</HI> but <HI>what we are bound to by</HI> the Covenant, <HI>is not to Reform them, but to Concur with them, when lawfully called, to Advance Reformation either there, or any where el&s;e: And it is far from our Thoughts to go beyond that Boundary,</HI> Vindication of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Pag. 16.</P>
<P>But this Clamour had another Effect, which might have been as Fatal in its Con&s;equence, had not the Scene of Affairs been very
<PB N="20" REF="231">
much changed in <HI>England:</HI> For this very Pretence, which the E|pi&s;copal Party prompted as much as in them lay here, and drew a|bundance of Good and Well meaning People into, in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as an Objection again&s;t the Union, they immediately turned upon them in <HI>England,</HI> and &s;et &s;ome of the Church of <HI>England</HI> Clergy, e&s;pe|cially tho&s;e warm Gentlemen who were again&s;t the Union; They &s;et them, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> upon rai&s;ing of the old Alarm again, of the Danger of the Church, ari&s;ing from the Union; even from this very Argument, that the Presbyterians in <HI>Scotland</HI> were Sworn by the Covenant, to do their utmo&s;t to pull down Epi&s;copacy in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall, as little as po&s;&s;ible, concern this Hi&s;tory with Debates of any of our Party Quarrels; but the Contradiction which the&s;e Peo|ple fell into, was remarkable; and could it have been con&s;idered, might have very much Expo&s;ed them.</P>
<P>For if it was true, that the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> had Sworn to De|throne Epi&s;copacy; and that the Presbyterians were again&s;t the Uni|on, becau&s;e it would deprive them of that Power, and for ever ty their Hands from that Work,&mdash;Then they were but ill Friends to the Church of <HI>England</HI> among her own Clergy, who were for that Rea&s;on again&s;t the Union.&mdash;And it was an Argument of the &s;tronge&s;t Nature to prove, that the Church of <HI>England</HI> &s;hould have been with all her Heart for the Union, if &s;he had the lea&s;t Know|ledge of her own Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>It is plain from Doctor <HI>Rule,</HI> that the Obligation of the Cove|nant extended no further, than to oblige them to concur with <HI>Eng|land,</HI> when lawfully called to a General Reformation.</P>
<P>But the Party in <HI>England</HI> run the&s;e things a great deal higher, and plyed the warm Addre&s;&s;es of the People; and e&s;pecially one of the <HI>Cameronians,</HI> and of their Leader Mr. <HI>John Hepburn,</HI> again&s;t the Uni|on; calling what tho&s;e weak People put into their Addre&s;&s;es, the Act and Deed of the whole Presbyterian Church of <HI>Scotland:</HI> When 'tis known, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That Mr. <HI>Hepburn</HI>'s Addre&s;s had but &s;even Hands to it. 2. Tho&s;e People, tho in other things many of them are good People, yet do neither owne the Church nor the State; neither the Civil Government nor the Eccle&s;ia&s;tick. Of which I &s;hall be larger hereafter.</P>
<P>By the&s;e Artifices 'tis hardly credible, what Aver&s;ions they rai&s;ed in the People again&s;t the Union in general, even before the Articles were made publick, or at all Debated in the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>But when the Articles were printed, and every one began to read Lectures upon them, according as their &s;everal Fancies guided them, or their Intere&s;t &s;eem'd to cla&s;h with them, I want Words to expre&s;s what a Clamour was rai&s;ed on all Hands, and what Feuds began to appear in every Corner of the Nation.</P>
<P>Parties and People, who&s;e Intere&s;ts and Principles differed as much as Light and Darkne&s;s; who were as contrary in Opinion, and as far a&s;under in every thing, as the <HI>Poles,</HI> &s;eemed to draw together here.&mdash;'Twas the mo&s;t mon&s;trous Sight in the World, to &s;ee the <HI>Jacobite</HI> and the <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> the per&s;ecuting Prelatic <HI>Non-juror</HI> and
<PB N="21" REF="232">
the <HI>Cameronian,</HI> the <HI>Papi&s;t</HI> and the Reformed <HI>Prote&s;tant,</HI> Parle toge|ther, Joyn Intere&s;t, and Concert Mea&s;ures together.</P>
<P>To &s;ee the <HI>Jacobites</HI> at <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> Huzzaing the Mob, and Encou|raging them to have a Care of the Church; The High-flying Epi&s;|copal Di&s;&s;enter crying out, the Overture was not a &s;ufficient Securi|ty for the Church.</P>
<P>Such Convul&s;ions as the&s;e Agitated the whole Kingdom; And it was the Unaccountable&s;t Thing that ever was known, to find a Nation, That, but a few Months before, were earne&s;tly crying out for an Union, and the nearer the better; and that were fully con|vinc'd of the Nece&s;&s;ity they had of this Union, now fly in the Face of their Ma&s;ters, and upbraid the Gentlemen, who managed it, with Selling and Betraying their Country, and Surrendering their Con&s;titution, Sovereignity and Independency to the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>And &s;uch was the Clamour again&s;t the Treaters, that I verily be|lieve, and I a&s;&s;ure you, I do not give my private Opinion in it,&mdash;had the Articles of the Treaty been publi&s;hed before the Treaters came home; and the Feuds been the &s;ame again&s;t them as were af|terwards, there was not many of them would dared to have gone home, without a Guard to protect them.</P>
<P>The Merchants, the Burghs, the Country People, all cryed out of Oppre&s;&s;ion, and of Ruine and De&s;truction in Trade.&mdash;And yet, the Amendments that were offered by that Party to the Articles, in the Time of their Debate, were &s;o &s;mall and &s;o trifling, tho they had a free Debate on every Head, that their own Friends cry|ed out upon them, for demanding &s;o little; and u&s;ed this as an Ar|gument again&s;t them afterwards, that they might have had more, if they had asked it.</P>
<P>Nor is it to be forgotten, that tho&s;e very Gentlemen, who rai&s;ed mo&s;t Noi&s;e at the General of the Treaty, had lea&s;t to &s;ay to the Particulars; had fewe&s;t Objections to make, and lea&s;t of all con|cern'd them&s;elves in the Amendments.&mdash;The Rea&s;on was plain, the De&s;ign was not to Amend the Treaty, but to De&s;troy it; They were not Sollicitous to have a good Treaty, but to have no Treaty; The Drift was to Confound it with Infinite Objections, and to Cla|mour the People out of their Wits, that they might, if po&s;&s;ible, Clamour the Parliament out of the Hou&s;e: And of this, &s;uch evi|dent Proofs will appear in the Proce&s;s of this Story, as no Body, I believe, will make any Doubt, but that there is Rea&s;on for &s;uch an Objection.</P>
<P>The Parliament was now met, and the Party who oppo&s;ed the Treaty diligently, made up their greate&s;t Strength within Doors in order to it.&mdash;I will not &s;ay, that &s;everal took the Oath of Par|liament, on purpo&s;e to be able to do Service again&s;t it, who never took the &s;aid Oath before,&mdash;but I know it was &s;o under&s;tood of &s;everal Gentlemen,&mdash;and they were reported to be advi&s;ed by their Friends to do &s;o.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Step they took without Doors, <HI>for the Matters within Door, I refer to the Ab&s;tract I &s;hall make of the Minuts in the end of</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="233">
<HI>this Work:</HI> But the fir&s;t Step they took without Doors, as to Par|ticulars, was to &s;et on Foot a Notion, that the Members of Parlia|ment had <HI>no Right to</HI> alter the Con&s;titution, without the particular Con&s;ent of their <HI>Con&s;tituents;</HI> And that therefore the Parliament ought to have an Adjournment for &s;ome time, that the Members might go down into the &s;everal and re&s;pective Countries, which they Repre&s;ented, and know the Mind of their Con&s;tituents.</P>
<P>And tho, this &s;eem'd to be many ways confuted by Strength of Ar|gument; wherein it was alledged, that this was not an Altering or Giving up the Con&s;titution; And therefore, &s;uppo&s;e it were true, that the Members were not impowered to Act, without the Con&s;ent of their Con&s;tituents, in Giving up the Con&s;titution, yet this did not reach here.</P>
<P N="2">2. It was alledged, that this Parliament was Summoned by Her Maje&s;ty, with an expre&s;s Signification in the Proclamation, that it was to Treat of, Con&s;ult about, and Conclude an Union with <HI>Eng|land;</HI> And being &s;ent up, for that declared purpo&s;e, by their Con|&s;tituents, there remain'd no Occa&s;ion to demand any further, or other In&s;tructions from them; but they became Plenipotentiaries from that particular Circum&s;tance.</P>
<P N="3">3. That, by the Con&s;titution, it was not required, that the Con|&s;tituents &s;hould be con&s;ulted on any &s;uch Occa&s;ion; That the Con|vention of E&s;tates Tran&s;po&s;ed the Crown, Altered the Succe&s;&s;ion, and Settled the Revolution; which, in all Circum&s;tances, was as E&s;&s;ential to the Con&s;titution as this; and that they never Con&s;ult|ed their Con&s;tituents in that Ca&s;e at all; nor did the Oppo&s;ers of the Revolution demand it; but Prote&s;ted, and went out of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>And, in this Ca&s;e, their Champion Mr. <HI>Hodges</HI> al&s;o was again&s;t them, who owned, that their Commi&s;&s;ioners to the Parliament had full Power to Act for them in this Ca&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>However,</HI> As things began to run very high, and the People, prompted by the&s;e Popular Arguments, A&s;&s;um'd every thing they thought fit to call their Right; &s;everal Burghs wrote Letters to their Repre&s;entatives, in their own Names, and by their own Authori|ties, Requiring them not to give their Votes, or A&s;&s;ents to an In|corporating Union;&mdash;<HI>Or, in &s;hort,</HI> not to the Union as now coming on, in the Terms of the Treaty.</P>
<P><HI>But this was not all;</HI> For, finding that this was not much regard|ded by the Members; and that Precedents in like Ca&s;es, would not &s;upport the Practice; They turn'd their private Letters into Pub|lick Addre&s;&s;es, and tho&s;e introduc'd Mobs, Tumults, In&s;ultings of Magi&s;trates, Flight of Gentlemen from their Hou&s;es, and all man|ner of Popular Di&s;orders; Till, at la&s;t, it came to downright In|&s;urrection and Rebellion: Which, had not Circum&s;tances, and the Sea&s;on particularly prevented, had ri&s;en up to Blood, Civil War, and all the Terrible Con&s;equences of an Inrag'd and Divided Nati|on, as &s;hall more at large be related in its Cour&s;e.</P>

But to return to the Party who oppo&s;ed the Treaty; at fir&s;t they &s;trove to carry on their Oppo&s;ition by wi&s;er Methods; and, by their Force of Arguments, to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Peoples Minds with &s;uch Aver|&s;ions, as might convince the Parliament, they were Acting again&s;t the general Current of the Nation.</P>
<P>And having not at <HI>fir&s;t</HI> appear'd again&s;t the thing in general, it behoved them to de&s;cend to particular Objections; For, to &s;ay, they would have no Union at all, would have been Impolitick, and have formed too great a Party again&s;t them: It was nece&s;&s;ary therefore, to form them&s;elves into a Body of Objectors, that had &s;ome Rea&s;on on their Side, and could de&s;cend to Particulars to en|force their Opinion.</P>
<P>Nor could they, in good Manners to the Queen, object again&s;t an Union in general, who, in Her Letters to the Parliament, had &s;o earne&s;tly recommended, upon all Occa&s;ions, the Union of Her People, as what Her Maje&s;ty e&s;teem'd &s;o much for their mutual Good; That &s;he would count it Her &s;ingular Happine&s;s, to have it compleated in Her Reign: On this Score, I &s;ay, &s;hould they have rejected all manner of Union, or Treaty of Union, it would have been &s;o directly flying in the Face of the Queens Recommendation, that it would have not only appeared rude, but have lo&s;t them a con&s;iderable Party, who&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tance they found very great Occa&s;ion for.</P>
<P>This brought all the &s;everal Parties, who were again&s;t the Treaty, as well tho&s;e that were again&s;t it, on the Account of the Succe&s;&s;ion, as tho&s;e that were again&s;t it in general, to fall in with tho&s;e, who on|ly objected again&s;t the Circum&s;tances of it; <HI>I mean,</HI> the Conditions, and Stipulations publi&s;hed in the Articles.</P>
<P>Thus the great Variety of Objectors, to make them&s;elves perfect|ly Formidable, however different in Notion or De&s;ign, made up one Body; and turn'd their Arguments from being pointed again&s;t the Union in general, to be pointed again&s;t the Terms of it, <HI>An Incorporating &V;nion.</HI></P>
<P>This brought them back to the &s;everal Schemes of Forreign Uni|ons of Nations, &s;uch as <HI>Switzerland,</HI> the <HI>&V;nited Provinces,</HI> and the like: And &s;ome propo&s;ed one thing, &s;ome another, not fore&s;eeing, that, had even any of their Propo&s;als come to have been the real Treaty; yet this Party, who were again&s;t the Union <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> would have been as much again&s;t that, as they were again&s;t this; and &s;o at la&s;t they mu&s;t have divided, broke their Intere&s;t, and lo&s;t the whole, which was the main thing aim'd at.</P>
<P>And thus now &s;tood the Debate.&mdash;<HI>No Incorporating &V;nion</HI> was the Word,<HI>&mdash;Let us have an &V;nion with</HI> England <HI>with all our Hearts,&mdash;but no Incorporation; Let us keep our Parliament, keep our Sovereignity,</HI> keep <HI>our Independency,</HI> keep <HI>our Con&s;titution,</HI> and for all the re&s;t, <HI>we are ready to &V;nite with you, as firmly as you can De|vi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>This was thought, by mo&s;t, to be ju&s;t reviving the former Notions of a Federal Union,&mdash;with &s;o many incon&s;i&s;tent Noun-Sub&s;tan|tives

in their Government, that had upon all Occa&s;ions been found Impracticable; and which would &s;o intirely have left both Na|tions Expo&s;ed to the Po&s;&s;ibility of a Relap&s;ing into a divided Con|dition, that it could not be expected, <HI>England, who&s;e Con&s;iderations for &V;niting, were Peace, Strength, and &s;hutting a back Door of conti|nual War, and Confu&s;ion from the North,</HI> &s;hould communicate Trade, Freedom of Cu&s;toms in all her Ports, and Plantations, with the Egre&s;s and Regre&s;s of Manufactures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and leave the main things yet precarious and uncertain.</P>
<P>It would be endle&s;s to trouble the Reader here with the Argu|ments on both &s;ides,&mdash;which came re&s;olved at la&s;t to this &s;hort Head.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the Treaty at <HI>London,</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commi&s;|&s;ioners had refu&s;ed to Treat, but upon an intire and Incorporating Union,&mdash;and had given &s;uch Rea&s;ons, why all other Propo|&s;als, would not only be in&s;ufficient, but impracticable; That the <HI>Scots</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners were convinc'd of it, and &s;atisfyed to enter up|on a Treaty of an intire Union, as the only way to e&s;tabli&s;h the la&s;ting Peace and Pro&s;perity of both Nations.</P>
<P>To talk then of a Federal Union at this time, &s;eem'd only to put the Que&s;tion, whether the Parliament &s;hould take the Articles into Con&s;ideration, or no.&mdash;And this run all the Oppo&s;ers back to the Schemes of tho&s;e, that were again&s;t the Union in general, and by this they lo&s;t Ground; For tho they made a &s;trong Oppo&s;ition again&s;t the very Reading the Articles at all, and would gladly have rejected them in the Gro&s;s; yet <HI>there</HI> &s;everal of their Friends left them, and &s;o they lo&s;t the fir&s;t Que&s;tion, <HI>Whether the Articles &s;hould be read,</HI> which was carryed in the Affirmative <HI>October</HI> 3<HI>d,</HI> the fir&s;t Day of the Meeting of the Parliament, as will appear by the Mi|nutes.</P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t Strait they were brought to; And therefore, to back the&s;e two Principles, they &s;et to Work to procure a Throng of Addre&s;&s;es from the &s;everal Towns,&mdash;and which 'tis vi&s;ible they attempted to back with Force, to awe the Parliament into a Com|plyance, as will hereafter appear.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the&s;e Addre&s;&s;es were worded to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, and in Sub&s;tance contain'd a Claim of the Con&s;tituents Right, to limit and in&s;truct their Commi&s;&s;ioners,&mdash;and a Direction to avoid an Incorporating Union; Some of them were decently prefac'd with Expre&s;&s;ions of Courte&s;y to <HI>England,</HI> and Willingne&s;s to Confede|rate, or Unite with them on other Terms; but Prote&s;ted again&s;t an Incorporation of Government, as contrary to their Liberties, and de&s;tructive to their Sovereignity and Independency, the Glory of their Ance&s;tors, the Honour of the Ancient Kingdom, and a great many &s;uch plau&s;ible Allegations, in order to make the Ground of their Addre&s;&s;ing &s;eem the more Specious, and to plea&s;e the People: Others le&s;s Courteous, &s;poke higher Words and rougher Language, talk'd of their Defending their Con&s;titution again&s;t the Inva&s;ion of Strangers, reflected on their Treaters, and their being wheedled and

drawn in to give up their Country, their Liberties, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> We &s;hall come to them pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>As the Parliament was now &s;itting, &s;o was the Commi&s;&s;ion,&mdash;this is a Deputation from the General A&s;&s;embly, being a certain Number of Mini&s;ters, Impowered by an Act of the A&s;&s;embly, to meet in the Intervals of their Se&s;&s;ion, to take Care of the Affairs of the Church.</P>
<P>The Tran&s;actions within the Parliament, I refer to the Ab&s;tract of the Minutes, with Ob&s;ervations immediately following this Ac|count. <HI>Folio</HI> &leftblank; But that this Account, which contains things done without Doors, may run Hand in Hand with the &s;aid Ab&s;tract, it is nece&s;&s;ary to give an Account what was Tran&s;acting in the Commi&s;&s;ion at the &s;ame time, at lea&s;t &s;o far as it relates to the pre&s;ent Affair.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erv'd in the Minutes of the 12<HI>th</HI> of <HI>October,</HI> that a Moti|on was made in Parliament for a Publick Fa&s;t; which, however, was oppo&s;ed by tho&s;e, that &s;ome thought, had more Inclination to the Work of a Publick Fa&s;t, than tho&s;e that propo&s;ed it; How|ever, as the Commi&s;&s;ion had been &s;everal days met, the Gentlemen in Parliament, who were again&s;t the having a Publick Fa&s;t appoint|ed by Parliament, &s;eemed to refer it to the Commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It was indeed oppo&s;ed in the Commi&s;&s;ion of the A&s;&s;embly, for the &s;ame Rea&s;ons that it was in Parliament, <HI>viz.</HI> Not for any Di&s;like of Fa&s;ting and Praying, but to prevent the Alarming and Amu&s;ing the People, which was the principal Work on Foot at that Time; However, not to neglect the Work, or be found op|po&s;ing &s;uch a thing, as Praying to GOD, on what&s;oever Account; It was moved in the Commi&s;&s;ion, That they &s;hould &s;et apart a Time for them&s;elves to Fa&s;t and Pray, as Mini&s;ters a&s;&s;embled on &s;o great an Occa&s;ion;) and that a Circular Letter &s;hould be &s;ent to the &s;everal Presbyteries, to do the &s;ame in their &s;everal Di&s;tricts.</P>
<P>The Act of the Commi&s;&s;ion, for this Day of Prayer, neither Con|fin'd them to a Day, or pre&s;crib'd the Manner;) The Act it &s;elf is to be found in the <HI>Appendix, N A x,</HI> as Copied from the Original in the Regi&s;ter.</P>
<P>There had been &s;trong Rumours &s;pread abroad, That the Com|mi&s;&s;ion would not Act, <HI>in this Ca&s;e,</HI> without the General A&s;&s;embly; but that they &s;hould Prote&s;t again&s;t the Union's being Concluded, till a General A&s;&s;embly was Called; and Addre&s;s the Parliament to Adjourn the Debate of it, till the A&s;&s;embly &s;hould meet, which was not to be till <HI>April.</HI>&mdash;Or, that the Lords of Her Maje&s;ties Council &s;hould procure from Her Maje&s;ty, that the A&s;&s;embly might be Cal|led &s;ooner.</P>
<P>But, as this was the Contrivance of a Party, only to gain Time; and of a piece with the Delays offered at in the Hou&s;e, at the &s;ame time; &s;o it met with no Incouragement in the Commi&s;&s;ion: Not, but that there was too &s;trong a Party willing to have Befriended it, at that time, even in the Commi&s;&s;ion it &s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="237">
<HI>However,</HI> a very Moderate and well Temper'd Addre&s;s was drawn up in the Commi&s;&s;ion; it was Agreed to in the Commi&s;&s;ion the 11<HI>th,</HI> but not pre&s;ented till the 17<HI>th:</HI> In which, they recommend to the Parliament, the Security of the Presbyterian Church of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> and its Doctrine, Di&s;cipline, Wor&s;hip and Government, to be &s;ecured by the Treaty, as you may &s;ee by the Addre&s;s it &s;elf, which is printed in the <HI>Appendix, N B x.</HI></P>
<P>After this, the Commi&s;&s;ion was again pre&s;&s;ed about the Fa&s;t; and more Mini&s;ters being come to Town, than were at the fir&s;t; and coming with the Sen&s;e of the Country People fre&s;h in their Minds, who were, by this time, every where rendered very unea&s;y, the Motion of a Fa&s;t was renewed; And tho &s;ome were again&s;t a Fa&s;t as National, yet, as no Body was again&s;t Praying to GOD, on &s;o Solemn Occa&s;ion, &s;o the Commi&s;&s;ion began with them&s;elves as follows.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 17<HI>th,</HI> It was Agreed, That the Members of the Com|mi&s;&s;ion, with &s;uch as plea&s;ed to joyn with them, &s;hould Con|veen in the High Church of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> for <HI>Prayer</HI> the Day fol|lowing; That the Moderator &s;hould begin with a &s;hort Di&s;cour&s;e from the Pulpit, concerning the Occa&s;ion and Rea&s;on of that Meeting, and the Mini&s;ters to Pray, and the Orders of the Ex|erci&s;e were &s;ettled by the Commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Accordingly, on the 18<HI>th,</HI> there was a very great Congrega|tion, where was pre&s;ent many Members of Parliament, and the Work continued till two of the Clock, very Publick and Solemn; but without any of the Exce&s;&s;es, which &s;ome People flattered them&s;elves to find there.</P>
<P><HI>However,</HI> after this, the Motion for a Fa&s;t was brought on a|gain, and carryed in the Commi&s;&s;ion on the 21<HI>&s;t</HI> of <HI>October,</HI> as from the Regi&s;ter follows.</P>
<P>There having formerly been a Motion made, for Application to the Parliament for a Publick National Fa&s;t; The Matter was this Day re&s;umed, and much Debate about it; The Commi&s;|&s;ion being pretty full, it took longer time; Some were for Ap|plying to the Parliament, for their Civil Sanction to it; Others, that Presbyteries &s;hould be wrote to, to Appoint a Fa&s;t, without Applying to the Parliament; becau&s;e it was feared, the Parlia|ment might not be Unanimous in that Matter; and the men|tioning of a Fa&s;t there, might, perhaps, in the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, be Occa&s;ion of Strife: And after long Deliberation, it was Unani|mou&s;ly Agreed unto, that Application &s;hould not be made to the Parliament; and a Committee was Named to bring in a Draught of the Paper about that Fa&s;t; which Committee brought in the &s;ame, in Form of an Act, upon the 22<HI>d</HI> of <HI>October;</HI> and af|ter &s;ome few Amendments, the &s;ame was Unanimou&s;ly Approven.</P>
<P>This Fa&s;t was ob&s;erved in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> very Solemnly, His Grace Her Maje&s;ties Commi&s;&s;ioner, the Lord Chancellor, the Great Officers of State, and many Members of Parliament appear'd at Church, and joyn'd in it, tho the Appointment had not the Sancti|on
<PB N="27" REF="238">
of the Civil Authority to &s;upport it.&mdash;A clear Proof, by the way, of the Parliaments owning the Power of Appointing Fa&s;ts, to be in the Church.</P>
<P>Yet was not this &s;uch a General National Fa&s;t, as &s;ome people de|&s;ired; hoping to obtain upon the People, by the Solemnity of the Thing; and by the Warmth of the Mini&s;ters, who, they vain|ly expected, would, in the Pulpit, run out again&s;t the Treaty; Bring the People to a general Aver&s;ion again&s;t it; and, by Con&s;equence, to &s;ome violent Mea&s;ures for preventing it.</P>
<P>But the Prudence of the Mini&s;ters prevented all this de&s;igned Mi&s;|chief;&mdash;and tho the Day was, as I have &s;aid, ob&s;erv'd with great Solemnity, and Affection; yet it was to their great Di&s;appoint|ment, that the Mini&s;ters generally, <HI>as well tho&s;e who were again&s;t the &V;nion,</HI> as tho&s;e <HI>who were for it,</HI> in their re&s;pective Pari&s;hes, applyed them&s;elves only &s;ummarily to the Sub&s;tance, nay, to the very Words of the A&s;&s;emblies Act, <HI>viz. That all the Determinations of the E|&s;tates of Parliament, with re&s;pect to an &V;nion with</HI> England, <HI>might be Influenced and Directed by Divine Wi&s;dom, to the Glory of GOD, the Good of Religion, and particularly of the Church of</HI> Scotland.</P>
<P>Thus the Thing was carryed thro', except as hereafter, without the Mi&s;chievous Effect, which &s;ome expected from it; who now begun to turn their Expectations another way, <HI>viz.</HI> To <HI>THE PEOPLE,</HI> who, they had, by various Arts, &s;crew'd up to an Un|expected Fermentation; as, in the en&s;uing Tumults, appear'd.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry, that, in the Proce&s;s of this Story, e&s;pecially in this, which I count the fowle&s;t and blacke&s;t part of it that could have been Acted, I &s;hall be obliged to mention &s;ome Per&s;ons of great Ho|nour, and Ancient Families; who were plea&s;ed, for Rea&s;ons of their own, to Act again&s;t the Union, and to appear &s;o publickly in the Oppo&s;ition of it, that <HI>the People,</HI> I do not &s;ay, by their own Appro|bation, <HI>I hope not,</HI> &s;ingled them out as the Patriots of their Country again&s;t this Tran&s;action; and, by their Shouts and Huzzas after them, as they went and came to and from the Parliament, made them, as it were, the Heads of the Party, who oppo&s;ed the Union.</P>
<P>The Dukes of <HI>Hamilton</HI> and <HI>Athole</HI> were the Chief of the&s;e, and were almo&s;t every day in Parliament, &s;trenuou&s;ly Arguing again&s;t the Articles, and pre&s;&s;ing for other Mea&s;ures, as by the Ob&s;ervations on the Minutes will appear.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Hamilton</HI> being Indi&s;po&s;ed by &s;ome Lamene&s;s, I cannot de&s;cribe the Occa&s;ion, was generally carryed to and from the Hou&s;e in his Chair.</P>
<P>The common People now &s;crew'd up to a Pitch, and Ripe for the Mi&s;chief de&s;igned, and prompted by the particular Agents of a wick|ed Party, began to be very In&s;olent: It had been whi&s;pered about &s;everal Days, that the Rabble would ri&s;e, and come up to the Parliament Hou&s;e, and cry out, <HI>No &V;nion;</HI> That they would take a|way the Honours, <HI>as they call them, viz.</HI> The Crown, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and carry them to the Ca&s;tle, and a long Variety of Fooli&s;h Reports of this kind.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="239">
But the fir&s;t Appearance of any thing Mobi&s;h was, that every day, when the Duke went up, but principally as he came down in his Chair from the Hou&s;e, the Mob follow'd him, &s;houting and crying out, GOD ble&s;s his Grace, for &s;tanding up again&s;t the Uni|on, and appearing for his Country, and the like.</P>
<P>And as Extremes are generally accompanyed with their Contra|ries; &s;o, while his Grace the Duke of <HI>Hamilton</HI> had the&s;e fancied Honours paid him, the Queens Repre&s;entative, the High Commi&s;|&s;ioner, had all the In&s;ults, Reproaches and Indignities offered him, that they dur&s;t, for fear of publick Ju&s;tice, &s;hew him. As will by and by appear.</P>
<P>Far be it from me to &s;ay, the Duke of <HI>Hamilton</HI> de&s;ired or encou|raged this Tumultuary kind of Congratulation; That &s;ort of Popula|rity mu&s;t be too much below a Per&s;on of his Character; and his Grace knows the World too well, and is too Wi&s;e a Man, not to know, that &s;uch things always tend to Confu&s;ion, and to the De|&s;truction of Civil Peace in the World.</P>
<P>Nor do I doubt, but his Grace did what he could, to prevent their &s;ingling him out, to &s;how their Mob Courte&s;ie to; but there was no Cru&s;hing a Rabble, that had &s;o many Wheels to &s;et it in Motion; and the &s;eeming Cau&s;es of which encrea&s;ed every day, <HI>as the &V;nion began to draw forward,</HI> and as the Members appeared re&s;olved to go forward with it &s;eriou&s;ly, in order to a Conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>On the 22<HI>d</HI> of <HI>October,</HI> they follow'd the Dukes Chair quite thro' the City down to the Abbey Gate; The Guards prevented their go|ing further; But all the way as they came back, they were heard to threaten what they would do the next day; That then they would be a thou&s;and times as many; That they would pull the Traitors, <HI>&s;o they call'd the Treaters of the &V;nion at</HI> London, out of their Hou|&s;es, and they would &s;oon put an end to the Union.</P>
<P>On the 23<HI>d,</HI> they made part of their Words good indeed; For, as the Parliament &s;at &s;omething late, the People gather'd in the Streets, and about the Doors of the Parliament Hou&s;e, and particularly the Par|liament Clo&s;s was almo&s;t full, that the Members could not go in or out without Difficulty; when Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> coming out of the Hou&s;e, the Mob Huzza'd as formerly, and follow'd his Chair in a very great Number; The Duke, in&s;tead of going down to <HI>the Abbey</HI> as u&s;ual, went up the High-Street to the <HI>Land-Market,</HI> as they call it, and &s;o to the Lodgings of the Duke of <HI>Athole;</HI> Some &s;aid, he went to avoid the Mob; Others maliciou&s;ly &s;aid, he went to point them to their Work.</P>
<P>While he went in to the Duke of <HI>Athole</HI>'s Lodgings, the Rabble at|tended at the Door; and, by Shouting and Noi&s;e, having increa&s;|ed their Numbers to &s;everal thou&s;ands, they began with Sir <HI>Patrick John&s;ton,</HI> who was one of the Treaters, and the Year before had been Lord Provo&s;t; Fir&s;t they a&s;&s;aulted his Lodgings with Stones and Sticks, <HI>and Cur&s;es not a few;</HI> but his Windows being too high, they came up the Stairs to his Door, and fell to Work at it with Sledges, or great Hammers; And, had they broke it open in their fir&s;t Fury,
<PB N="29" REF="240">
he had, without doubt, been Torn in Pieces without Mercy; and thus only, becau&s;e he was a Treater in the Commi&s;&s;ion to <HI>England;</HI> For, before that, no Man was &s;o well Belov'd, as he, over the whole City.</P>
<P>His Lady, in the utmo&s;t De&s;pair with this Fright, comes to the Window, with two Candles in her Hand, that &s;he might be known; and cryed out, <HI>for GODs Sake,</HI> to call the Guards: An Hone&s;t Apothecary in the Town, who knew her Voice, and &s;aw the Di|&s;tre&s;s &s;he was in, and to whom the Family, under GOD, is obliged, for their Deliverance, ran immediately down to the Town Guard; but they would not &s;tir, without the Lord Provo&s;ts Order;&mdash;but that being &s;oon obtain'd, one Captain <HI>Richard&s;on,</HI> who Command|ed, taking about thirty Men with him, March'd bravely up to them; and making his way with great Re&s;olution thro' the Croud, they Flying, but Throwing Stones, and Hallowing at him, and his Men, he Seized the Foot of the Stair Ca&s;e; and then boldly went up, clear'd the Stair, and took &s;ix of the Rabble in the very Act; and &s;o delivered the Gentleman and his Family.&mdash;</P>
<P>But this did not put a Stop to the general Tumult, tho it deliver|ed this particular Family; For the Rabble, by this time, were prodigiou&s;ly increa&s;ed, and went Roving up and down the Town, Breaking the Windows of the Members of Parliament, and In&s;ult|ing them in their Coaches, in the Streets; They put out all the Lights, that they might not be di&s;covered; and the Author of this had one great Stone thrown at him, for but looking out of a Window; for they &s;uffered no Body to look out, e&s;pecially with any Lights, le&s;t they &s;hould know Faces, and Inform again&s;t them afterwards.</P>
<P>By this time, it was about eight or nine a Clock at Night, and now they were ab&s;olute Ma&s;ters of the City; and it was Reported, they were going to &s;hut up all the Ports;&mdash;The Lord Commi&s;&s;ioner being Inform'd of that, &s;ent a Party of the Foot Guards, and took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Nether-Bow,</HI> which is a Gate in the Middle of the High-Street, as <HI>Temple-Bar</HI> between the City of <HI>London</HI> and the Court.</P>
<P>The City was now in a Terrible Fright, and every Body was under Concern for their Friends; The Rabble went Raving about the Streets till Midnight, frequently Beating Drums, and rai|&s;ing more People; when my Lord Commi&s;&s;ioner being Inform'd, there were a Thou&s;and of the Seamen and Rabble come up from <HI>Leith;</HI> and Apprehending, if it were &s;uffered to go on, it might come to a Dangerous Head, and be out of his Power to &s;uppre&s;s,&mdash;he &s;ent for the Lord Provo&s;t, and Demanded, that the Guards &s;hould March into the City.</P>
<P>The Lord Provo&s;t, after &s;ome Difficulty, yielded; tho it was alledg|ed, that it was what was never known in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> before&mdash;About one a Clock in the Morning, a Battallion of the Guards entred the Town, Marched up to the Parliament Clo&s;s, and took Po&s;t in all
<PB N="30" REF="241">
the Avenues of the City, which prevented the Re&s;olutions taken to In&s;ult the Hou&s;es of the re&s;t of the Treaters.</P>
<P>The Rabble were intirely reduc'd by this, and gradually di&s;pers'd, and &s;o the Tumult ended.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to de&s;cribe here, the Con&s;ternation all Good Peo|ple were in, at the Ri&s;ing of this Tumult; and had not &s;uch Re|&s;olutions been at la&s;t taken, as is above-mentioned, <HI>which the other Party did not expect,</HI> it had been the fatale&s;t Rabble the Nation had ever &s;een.</P>
<P>In this Ca&s;e my Lord Commi&s;&s;ioner greatly di&s;appointed the Par|ty, who, having In&s;ulted his Graces Lenity before, as a Faintne&s;s of Re&s;olution, had &s;pread about Scandalous Reports, That the Government dur&s;t not look the Rabble in the Face; That the High Commi&s;&s;ioner was afraid of being Rabbled in his Palace; and that, if they once ro&s;e in a Mob, all would fly before them; That the Parliament would run away, and di&s;&s;olve them&s;elves, or fly to the Ca&s;tle; and another wor&s;e thing than all, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Souldiers were on their &s;ide, and would not fight again&s;t their Country, as they called it.</P>
<P>But the Re&s;olution of the Lord Commi&s;&s;ioner di&s;appointed them all, who now &s;hew'd them, he had as much cheerful Bravery in the Action, as he had Calmne&s;s and Temper in the Parliament; This broke all their Mea&s;ures; and when they &s;aw the Guards, led by Brave and Faithful Officers, &s;tand firm to their Duty, and &s;hew them&s;elves re&s;olutely forward to defend the Government, they lo&s;t all their Courage; it defeated all their Expectations, and they began to lay a&s;ide that &s;ort of violent Proceedings, and apply them&s;elves to the Artifice of Words, and the Managry of Parties in the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved al&s;o, That this Rabble was a Mine &s;prung before its Time, which blew backwards, and de&s;troyed the Engi|neers, rather than the Enemies; <HI>The Plot</HI> being otherwi&s;e laid, <HI>viz.</HI> That it &s;hould not have broken out, till &s;ome Days following; when, as was &s;aid, all would have been in readine&s;s, to have fini|&s;hed the Work at one Blow, <HI>viz.</HI> To have blown up the Govern|ment at once.</P>
<P>They had been Tampering with the Souldiery, in order to De|bauch them from their Duty; and &s;ome People talk'd of retiring from the Parliament, and of &s;ome Great Men Heading the People; which, had their Patience been more, and their Conduct a little more &s;ecret, they had, without Doubt, effectually brought it to pa&s;s; But they blew their own Project up by their Precipitation, and &s;o &s;aved their Country by their very Attempt to de&s;troy it.</P>
<P>The Author of this had his Share of the Danger in this Tumult, and tho unknown to him, was watch'd and &s;et by the Mob, in or|der to know where to find him, had his Chamber Windows In|&s;ulted, and the Windows below him broken by Mi&s;take.&mdash;But, by the Prudence of his Friends, the Shortne&s;s of its Continuance, and GODs Providence, he e&s;caped.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="242">
Several of the Rabble were &s;eized upon, and apprehended; and there was a Di&s;cour&s;e of making Examples of &s;ome of them; but the Mercy of the High Commi&s;&s;ioner, <HI>however provoked and abu&s;ed,</HI> prevail'd to Compa&s;&s;ionate, rather than Puni&s;h their Follies; They were only kept &s;ome time in Pri&s;on, and afterwards let go, without any other Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>And thus ended the mo&s;t dangerous Juncture of the whole Trea|ty, and a Tumult, which ended to the Advantage of the Govern|ment, and the Di&s;heartning the Party, who, before that, carryed it with &s;uch an unheard of In&s;olence; That, had they not been, as they thought, &s;ure of their Cau&s;e, they would never have An|&s;wer'd it to their own Di&s;cretion, to have Acted in &s;o Open and In&s;ulting a Manner.</P>
<P>The Foot Guards, and two other Regiments of Foot, did now con&s;tant Duty in the City, <HI>viz.</HI> The Regiments of <HI>Strathnaver</HI> and <HI>Grant;</HI> The Hor&s;e Guards attended the Commi&s;&s;ioner, the other Battallion of Guards at the Palace, and the Gari&s;on at the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>And all was little enough; For the Regiments were thin, and few; and all the Forces then in the Kingdom, <HI>&s;ome Independent Companies in the Highlands excepted,</HI> did not exceed three thou&s;and Men; and great Endeavours were u&s;ed, as I have &s;aid, to De|bauch the Souldiers, tho in vain; they appearing Faithful and Forward, to do their Duty on all Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The next day the Parliament did not &s;it; but a great Council was a&s;&s;embled, where the Mea&s;ures the Lord Commi&s;&s;ioner had taken, as to bringing the Guards into the City, was Ratified and Approv|ed; and a Proclamation publi&s;hed for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the Rabble; which being &s;omething particular, is in&s;erted in the <HI>Appendix, N^o. C x.</HI></P>
<P>I have printed this Proclamation, tho this Work could very ill &s;pare Room for it; both becau&s;e it recites the Acts of Parliament in <HI>Scotland</HI> in Force again&s;t Rabbles; as al&s;o, for that the Method is particular to that place, and very good to prevent Tumults, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. Of obliging the Deacons of Crafts, <HI>that is, as in</HI> London, <HI>the Ma&s;ters of Companies,</HI> to Summon the Inhabitants, and make them give Security for the Behaviour of their Servants, Apprentices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 2. Giving an Indemnity to the Souldiers, either of the Regiments, or Town-Guards, in ca&s;e they &s;hould wound or kill any Per&s;on, af|ter a Command given for all to retire from the Streets.&mdash;</P>
<P>Indeed there was Occa&s;ion enough for &s;uch a Proclamation; and, had not the Party been broken, <HI>as before,</HI> all would have been little enough, to have &s;uppre&s;s'd the Fury of this Enraged Multitude.</P>
<P>No Body would undertake to ju&s;tify the Rabble, <HI>e&s;pecially after they had been defeated in the De&s;ign.</HI>&mdash;Every Body cryed out, it was a Dangerous Thing; and the whole City might have been ex|po&s;ed to Plunder, Riot, and all manner of Di&s;order.</P>
<P>But, as the Party could not ju&s;tify the Rabble, &s;o they began a new Clamour; and now they exclaim'd, That the Privileges of
<PB N="32" REF="243">
the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> were invaded, and Souldiers brought in, to awe and oppre&s;s the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>That this had not been done in &s;ixty Years before, nor ever, but in the Time of War and Tyrannick Government; and that it was a Fore-runner of the Slavery of the Nation.</P>
<P>Then they cryed out, this was an Inva&s;ion of the Freedoms of Parliament, and an Awe upon the Members, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> See the Minuts of the 25<HI>th</HI> of <HI>October,</HI> where that Matter was urged very warmly.</P>
<P>'Tis true, it had been to be wi&s;hed, the Affair could have been carryed on, without any Jealou&s;ies and In&s;ults; But, on the other &s;ide, it was alledged, That the Force put on the Government by the Rabble, was an Inva&s;ion of the Publick Peace; and that the Mob were the Aggre&s;&s;ors, and the Parliament was much more likely to be Awed by the Ungovern'd Rabbles of the Streets, if they had gotten a Head, than by the Forces brought in for their Security; who being at their Command, did nothing but &s;ecure them from the In&s;ults of the Mob, and keep that Peace which the Civil Authority had not Power to pre&s;erve.</P>
<P>That the Military Power is always &s;uppo&s;ed to be a&s;&s;i&s;ting to the Civil, when oppre&s;t by Rabbles and Tumults; and while in Sub|&s;ervience to the Civil Peace, and Subordinate to the Civil Powers, the proper Safe-Guard of a State;&mdash;and as the Force of the&s;e Ar|guments carryed all things before them in the Hou&s;e, all the legal Pretences were overthrown, by the Rea&s;on and Nature of the Thing, and the Parliament approved of all that had been done.</P>
<P>Nor did they Approve it only; but Ordered the Guards to be Continued, or recommended it to the Lord High Commi&s;&s;ioner, and the Privy Council, to continue their Care for the Safety and Security of the Parliament. <HI>Vide the Minuts of October</HI> 25<HI>th.</HI></P>
<P>However, by this Method, the Appearance of the Rabbles, and the Fury of the Streets, were, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, Abated; yet the People appeared Exa&s;perated to the la&s;t Degree; The Huzzaing and Crouding about Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> continued, notwith&s;tanding all his Endeavours to prevent it; and unu&s;ual Threatnings and dark Speeches were heard among the People.</P>
<P>The Lords, and others, who oppo&s;ed the placing Guards in the Streets, made Prote&s;ts again&s;t it, as Infringing the Liberties of the Parliament; tho it was very plain, that there was nothing Impo&s;ed in Parliament, nothing offered to be Carryed, but by Rea&s;oning and fair Voting.</P>
<P>From this Time, they began to talk of Country Tumults; and that, &s;ince the Commi&s;&s;ioner had &s;uppre&s;s'd the Mob in the Town, the whole Country &s;hould ri&s;e, and come up to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and remove the Guards by Force from Impri&s;oning the Parliament.</P>
<P>The Pretence was Specious; They pretended, the Guards were a Force upon the Members of Parliament; That this was Craming the Union down their Throats; That the Country was Unanimou&s;|ly again&s;t it, and would not bear, that a few People in the Hou&s;e, becau&s;e they had the Majority within Doors, and a Band of Souldi|ers
<PB N="33" REF="244">
to back them, &s;hould Impo&s;e a Conjunction with <HI>England</HI> upon them, whether they would or no:&mdash;(Any Body may judge what a Time this was, when every day the Town was alarm'd; To Day the North was up in Arms, to Morrow the We&s;t; To Day &s;uch a Shire, to Morrow another, the next Day a Third; <HI>Gla&s;gow, Dumfries, Hamilton, Perth,</HI> all the places which the Imagination of the People dictated, and the Fears of others apprehended.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the Con&s;ternation of the People: Tho&s;e that wi&s;hed well to the Publick Peace, and who &s;aw, that a Commotion at this Time, mu&s;t immediatly involve the Nation in War, and Blood, not with <HI>England</HI> only, but with one another; the&s;e Trembled for Fear of the De&s;olation of their Country, the Blood and Ruine that always attends a Civil War, and the Danger of the Lives of them&s;elves and their Relations.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who look'd &s;eriou&s;ly into the Drift of &s;ome of that Party, who mo&s;t eagerly pu&s;h'd on the&s;e Divi&s;ions, who &s;aw how the Intere&s;t of a Popi&s;h, a <HI>Jacobite,</HI> and a Per&s;ecuting Bloody Ge|neration <HI>lately extingui&s;h'd, and now full of Hopes,</HI> was Twi&s;ted, and all joyn'd in Anti-Union Principles, could not but be heartily con|cern'd for the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Religion, and Prote&s;tant Church; which they mu&s;t have been wilfully blind, who could not &s;ee was plainly &s;truck at, by the Oppo&s;ers of this Treaty.</P>
<P>To &s;ee others, who&s;e De&s;igns could not be &s;u&s;pected of any thing, to the Detriment of either Religion, or their Native Country, yet joyning blindly with a Wicked and Degenerate Race, and &s;eeming to approve the Steps which were taken, to the Ruine and De&s;tructi|on of both; To &s;ee the&s;e &s;hut their Eyes again&s;t the plain Di&s;co|veries of a &s;tated Re&s;olution again&s;t both Liberty and Religion, and encourage, <HI>nay, in too much</HI> joyn with them, who were known Enemies both to the National Church, and Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion; The&s;e, I &s;ay, were very Melancholly Things, when the Pro&s;pect of them was &s;o near to tho&s;e, who were &s;incerely concerned for the Peace of the Country, and the Safety of the Reformed Religion;&mdash;And People went up and down wandering and amazed, expecting every day &s;trange Events; afraid of Peace, and afraid of War; Many knew not which way to fix their Re&s;olutions; They could not be clear for the Union; yet they &s;aw Death at the Door, in its breaking off; Death to their Liberty, to their Religion, and to their Country.</P>
<P>Here were good People of all Opinions, as well as others; Some were again&s;t the Union, on a Principle of Ju&s;tice and Hone&s;ty, as earne&s;tly as others were again&s;t it, on a Principle of Treachery to their Country; Some were firmly po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, that they were under National Engagements, which, in the Nature of them, cla&s;h'd with the Union; and that therefore, however it might be nece&s;&s;ary for the Safety, and Peace of either Church, or Nation, they could not get over tho&s;e Obligations, or con&s;ent to this Evil, that the other Good might come;&mdash;And however the&s;e might, in the Con&s;e|quence of the Thing, Countenance the wicked Foundation, on which
<PB N="34" REF="245">
the other acted; yet I cannot but do them that Ju&s;tice, that I be|lieve, they were far from the lea&s;t Intention, to encourage the &s;trengthening a Party, who&s;e Principle was <HI>French</HI> Government, and a Popi&s;h Sovereign. I will not an&s;wer for Indi&s;cretion, or Errors in Temper in &s;ome; neither will I be &s;o unju&s;t, as to call every wrong Step an Error of Principle, and every mi&s;taken Man a Plotter again&s;t his Country.</P>
<P>This was the unhappy divided Condition of this People, at the beginning of the Treaty. The Divi&s;ion was &s;o general, that it &s;pread thro' every part; The Gentry were divided, the Common People divided, nay, the very Mini&s;ters were divided; Parliament, A&s;&s;embly, Court, City, Counties, Towns, nay, almo&s;t every Fa|mily were divided; and as the Event began to be feared on every &s;ide, People &s;tood &s;trangely doubtful of one another.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ion of the A&s;&s;embly hitherto carryed, <HI>as before noted,</HI> with a great deal of Prudence and Moderation; and tho there were &s;ome unhappy Struggles there, which perhaps were pointed, by the &s;ame Party, at making a Breach; yet as they came to no Head, and were &s;oon cru&s;h'd by the Wi&s;dom and Conduct of the re&s;t, I &s;hall not pre&s;erve the Memory of them to Po&s;terity; The general Proceed|ings of that Reverend Body being always Tempered with Mode&s;ty, Calmne&s;s, and Di&s;cretion, at the &s;ame time that they were anxi|ou&s;ly concerned for the Security of the Foundation on which they &s;tood, and had the whole Weight of the Church of <HI>Scotlands</HI> Safety upon their Hands.</P>
<P>They had Addre&s;s'd the Parliament, That Care might be taken of the Church in the Treaty; and had been a&s;&s;ured, they &s;hould have their Expectation fully An&s;wer'd.</P>
<P>And I cannot but remark here, That the Foundation of this Trea|ty herein appeared to have been wi&s;ely laid; The Under&s;tandings and well poi&s;ed Judgments of its fir&s;t Contrivers was very Con&s;picu|ous, in leaving the re&s;pective Parliaments a full Liberty, &s;o to E&s;ta|bli&s;h the &s;everal Churches, as that all the Security they could de|mand, one again&s;t the other, &s;hould be granted them; That every Root of Jealou&s;y might be pull'd up, and there might be no Room for the Sowers of Di&s;cord to begin here, where they always u&s;ed to begin; and from whence all the Mi&s;chiefs of former Di&s;&s;ention u&s;ed to flow.</P>
<P>The Parliament had al&s;o been Encouraged by the Queen, in Her Maje&s;ties Letter, <HI>Vide Folio</HI> 3<HI>d. of this Part,</HI> at the Opening this Se&s;&s;ion, to Form &s;uch Security for the Church Government, as might fully E&s;tabli&s;h the National Church of <HI>Scotland;</HI>&mdash;For the Queen having, by long Experience, and the former Contention on both &s;ides, &s;een, that an Union of Principles was no more to be expected,&mdash;but plainly &s;eeing al&s;o, that, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mutual Charity, that Difference in Principle might be Con&s;i&s;ting with an Union of Intere&s;ts, and Affection, among Her People, &s;aw, at the &s;ame time, that the only way to E&s;tabli&s;h this Peace, was, to Form &s;uch Securities to both Churches, as might, for ever, re|remove
<PB N="35" REF="246">
all ju&s;t Ground of Jealou&s;ies, from among them, take away the Su&s;picions, and &s;hut all the Doors again&s;t the Fears, which ei|ther had entertain'd of each other; and which wicked Men daily took hold of, as Handles of Contention, to keep open an Eternal Breach, and keep us always divided, <HI>Ephraim</HI> again&s;t <HI>Judah,</HI> and <HI>Judah</HI> again&s;t <HI>Ephraim;</HI> ever vexing and envying one another.</P>
<P>In this Po&s;ture, I &s;ay, &s;tood the Affairs of the Church; when, in the Interval of Time, between the fir&s;t Addre&s;s to the Parliament, and the &s;econd Reading of the Articles, <HI>Vide Minuts, Folio</HI> An Overture, or Draught of an Act for the Church, was conceived, and on the &leftblank; of &leftblank; was pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not enter into a long Debate which aro&s;e here, both with|out Doors and within. 1. As to the Sufficiency and In&s;ufficiency of the Overture, which, in &s;ome part, may be An&s;wer'd, by &s;ay|ing, it received &s;ome Amendments or Additions afterwards, at the pa&s;&s;ing into an Act. Or, 2. As to any Act of Parliament being a &s;ufficient Security for the Church; That Objection being rai&s;ed at fir&s;t, not by &s;uch as de&s;igned a better Security, but by &s;uch as real|ly de&s;igned no Security at all, for the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical E&s;tabli&s;hment in this Nation: It is hard, That we mu&s;t be forced to di&s;tingui&s;h the Di&s;putes in this Ca&s;e, by di&s;tingui&s;hing the Per&s;ons; for there be|ing &s;everal Parties here, and of &s;everal Principles, who all &s;eem'd to make but one Party again&s;t the Union, it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to Examine who was for this, or that Argument; and, by the Man, the Rea&s;on of his Argument, was to be di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>This Untiddled the My&s;tery, which appear'd in the Debates of this Time; when tho&s;e that had really lea&s;t Kindne&s;s for the Church, were the loude&s;t, and appear'd the mo&s;t Zealous for her Se|curity: Nay, tho&s;e that never owned, or acknowledged either her Di&s;cipline, or Government, never &s;ubmitted to her Judicatories, or joyn'd with her Wor&s;hip, were now every day crying out of want of Security, Expo&s;ing the Church to the Votes of the Bi&s;hops in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, and giving the Epi&s;copal Church of <HI>England</HI> the A&s;cendant over the Presbyterian Church of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>This Language could be no otherwi&s;e under&s;tood, but by di&s;tin|gui&s;hing the People that &s;poke it; The very Party were Hierogly|phicks to the Dialect; and he mu&s;t be blinder than mo&s;t People are, in this Intelligent Age, that could imagine, the&s;e People &s;poke this from a true De&s;ign to obtain for the Church a farther or bet|ter Security, &s;o much as to embarras the Church and the State, em|broil the Parliament with the Commi&s;&s;ion; and either prevent its being fini&s;hed at all, or obtain what they generally drove at, in all their Managements now in the Affair; and, which was the only thing they could hope in, <HI>I mean, A DELAY.</HI></P>
<P>But to leave this Matter a while, the Parliament was all this time Reading over the Articles, and Di&s;cour&s;ing or Rea&s;oning upon them, but had not yet come to any Vote; The Tumult at <HI>Edin|burgh,</HI> was blown over, without the expected Event; we &s;hall now &s;ee, that it was not in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> alone, that a Tumult was de&s;ign|ed,
<PB N="36" REF="247">
but Steps were taken, <HI>and indeed Politickly enough,</HI> to have the general Sen&s;e of the Kingdom to run in the &s;ame Channel.</P>
<P>To this End, Addre&s;&s;es were &s;et on Foot, in &s;everal parts of the Kingdom again&s;t the Union: I &s;hall not pretend to croud this Book with the particular Addre&s;&s;es, tho &s;ome of them are remarkable enough; However, I &s;hall give <HI>Specimens</HI> of &s;ome of them to judge from, and to make the Matter, as I go along, the plainer.</P>
<P>And, among them, I cannot omit one from the Convention of the Royal Burghs; becau&s;e &s;ome Gentlemen, e&s;pecially in <HI>England,</HI> having valued their Opinion from thence, as if it were the Sen&s;e of the whole Nation: It is a little nece&s;&s;ary, towards clearing up this Point, That, tho the People were &s;crew'd up to a mo&s;t Un|expected, and indeed Unaccountable Aver&s;ion; yet that, in the whole, the main Body of the Nation did not run the length which &s;ome of their Leaders de&s;ir'd of them, and which they would have had pa&s;s'd as their Act and Deed.</P>
<P>The Royal Burghs have a Cu&s;tom in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that they act in a Body, and have a Convention, or Repre&s;entative of their own, which meets upon Occa&s;ion at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and are conveened by the Lord Provo&s;t of <HI>Edinburgh:</HI> To this Convention, every Burgh &s;ends one Member, and the Burgh of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> two; Their whole Repre&s;entative is &s;ixty &s;ix in Number.&mdash;Now the Calcu|lation which was ob&s;ervable here, was in the Number and Quality of the Burghs, which Voted in the Convention; The Addre&s;s was carryed by four Voices indeed, but the State of the Ca&s;e is thus; Of &s;ixty &s;ix Burghs, twenty Voted again&s;t Addre&s;&s;ing, and twenty four for it, the re&s;t were ab&s;ent. But take the Quality of the Burghs, to make the Calculation by, and there the thing will di&s;cover it &s;elf as follows;</P>
<P>Take the Burghs that refu&s;ed to Addre&s;s, and the&s;e that did not think it worth while to appear; and the Majority again&s;t the Ad|dre&s;&s;ers, is, by the Proportion of <HI>their Ce&s;s,</HI> as eighty &s;ix to four|teen. Nay, &s;uppo&s;e all tho&s;e that did not appear to be Affirmatives, tho that be altogether improbable, and that they would have been for the Addre&s;s, yet the Proportion had been, as thirty one to &s;ix|ty nine.&mdash;</P>
<P>But if <HI>the Rate of the Ce&s;s</HI> be not a ju&s;t E&s;timate of the Value of the Burghs, <HI>tho I can prove it was the Original of their Right of being Burghs;</HI> then I refer to any Man to calculate the Inhabitants and Number of Free-men in each Burgh, and he will find the twenty Burghs that refu&s;ed to Addre&s;s, have more Inhabitants in them, than both the twenty four that Addre&s;s'd, and the twenty two that were ab&s;ent, the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> excepted.</P>
<P>So that, upon the Foot of this Calcul, tho the Addre&s;s may legal|ly be called the Addre&s;s of the Burrows; yet it did not follow, that the Trading Part of the Nation had Addre&s;&s;ed, or were again&s;t the Union; for that, in an Arithmetical Calculation, or a Calculation upon Value and Payment of Taxes, the far greater Number oppo&s;ed the very Addre&s;&s;ing at all.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="248">
This is ob&s;erved here, in order to clear up a Point hereafter; which will require a like kind of Calculating, on the Foot of the whole Nation.</P>
<P>The Burghs however, by this &s;eeming Majority, did Addre&s;s; and becau&s;e the &s;aid Addre&s;s is very particular, and contains in it all the Popular Arguments, which the Enemies of the Treaty had blinded the People with, <HI>as before;</HI> particularly of the Surrender|ing the Sovereignity, and Independency of the Nation, and Sub|jecting their Religion, Church Government, Claim of Right, Laws, Liberties, and Trade, to be Altered or Subverted by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament; For this Rea&s;on, I have given you the Addre&s;s it &s;elf at large in the <HI>Appendix, N^o. D x.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot, <HI>I confe&s;s,</HI> but wonder, how it was po&s;&s;ible to impo&s;e things &s;o ab&s;urd upon a whole Nation! And how &s;o Great a People, &s;o clear Sighted, and Wary in all other Ca&s;es, came, at this time, to run &s;o apparently upon a plain Mi&s;take! Since, as nothing is more plain, than that the Articles of the Treaty, and con&s;equently the Great Heads mentioned in the above Addre&s;s, can|not be touch'd by the Parliament of <HI>Britain;</HI> and that the Moment they Attempt it, they Di&s;&s;olve their own Con&s;titution; &s;o it is an Union upon no other Terms, and is expre&s;ly Stipulate, what &s;hall, and what &s;hall not be Alterable by the &s;ub&s;equent Parliaments;&mdash;And as the Parliaments of <HI>Britain</HI> are founded, not upon the Ori|ginal Right of the People, as the &s;eparate Parliaments of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> were before, but upon the Treaty, which is prior to the &s;aid Parliament, and con&s;equently &s;uperior;&mdash;So, for that Rea&s;on, it cannot have Power to Alter its own Foundation, or Act again&s;t the Power which formed it; &s;ince all Con&s;tituted Power is Subordinate, and Inferior to the Power Con&s;tituting.</P>
<P>This is &s;o clear, and has been &s;o often Inculcated in this very Ca&s;e, and is &s;o Unan&s;werably Stated in the very Acts of Par|liament them&s;elves, <HI>Ratifying the Treaty,</HI> that I need &s;ay no more to it here.</P>
<P>But it was a &s;trange Time now, and there was no making the lea&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion upon the Minds of the People, <HI>already prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd;</HI>&mdash;Nothing was to be heard now, but of Slavery to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> running away with the Crown, taking away their Nation, and the like:&mdash;And it was impo&s;&s;ible to Stem this Tide of Di&s;traction for a Time;&mdash;It is true, that the Generality of the People came off from this Delu&s;ion at la&s;t; and the Unalterablene&s;s of the Uni|on, if fini&s;h'd, began to obtain a little upon the Sen&s;es of the Peo|ple;&mdash;The Truth is, the Demon&s;tration of the Thing was &s;o vi&s;ible, that it could not but prevail; and the Be&s;t, and mo&s;t Ju|dicious, beginning to &s;ee into it, the re&s;t of the People began, to &s;ink under the Power of the Conviction, and &s;o by Degrees the Scruple began to wear off.</P>
<P>Nay, the &s;ame People, who fir&s;t argued again&s;t this Truth, <HI>viz. Of the Parliament of</HI> Britains <HI>not being able to Invade the Treaty,</HI> took it up them&s;elves afterward, when it &s;erved their Turn, and &s;trongly
<PB N="38" REF="249">
urged it again&s;t Con&s;enting to the Church E&s;tabli&s;hment on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Side; &s;ince it was a Confirming the Epi&s;copal Power, and &s;etting it up above the Power of a Parliament to pull down; <HI>So freely will Men accept of an Argument, when it &s;erves their Occa&s;ion, which they will reject, while it &s;eems to oppo&s;e their Intere&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>In the Ruines of this Sugge&s;tion, another &s;tarted up; which, as it was capable of being Embara&s;s'd with greater Doubts, and with &s;ome, had In&s;uperable Difficulties; &s;o, had not the Mode|ration of the Mini&s;ters Interpo&s;ed, it might have been of far wor&s;e Con&s;equence in this Ca&s;e; and this was a Scruple again&s;t the Uni|on in Gro&s;s, as being directly again&s;t, and incon&s;i&s;tent with the Covenant; and that therefore it could not be entred into, with|out incurring the Guilt of National Perjury.</P>
<P>This brought the Church into the General Appearance again&s;t the Treaty;&mdash;Nor will I &s;ay, but that great Means were u&s;ed, if po&s;&s;ible, to bring the Commi&s;&s;ion then &s;itting, to declare again&s;t the Union. upon this Account.</P>
<P>This was a great Tryal of Skill; and I &s;ay, this ro&s;e out of the Ruines of the other Scruple, becau&s;e it was forcibly enough alledg|ed, That, if the Con&s;titution of this Treaty was &s;uch, that no Al|teration could be &s;uffered; and that not the Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI> could infringe one Article of it; Then this for ever &s;hut the Door again&s;t the Po&s;&s;ibility of their A&s;&s;i&s;ting, to Reform the Church of <HI>England,</HI> which they alledged, by their Covenant, they were bound to u&s;e all lawful Endeavours to perform.</P>
<P>This, and &s;ubmitting to the Juri&s;diction of the Bi&s;hops in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and who were to &s;it &s;till in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, and there|by owning the Agency of Spiritual Men in Civil Imployments, they al&s;o alledged was again&s;t the Covenant: And con&s;equently, if the Nation went into this Union, they incurred directly the Guilt of National Perjury; and I allow, that a great many Good and Va|luable People were very Melancholly upon this Head, and &s;ome are not ea&s;y in it to this Hour.</P>
<P>I cannot pa&s;s this thing here, without &s;peaking to it; becau&s;e I fore&s;ee dayly Di&s;putes do &s;till ari&s;e upon this Head, and are like to do &s;o every day, and I &s;hall not interrupt the Thread of the Story by it at all; rather it will &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary to be con&s;idered, in or|der to carry on the Cour&s;e of the Story, &s;ome of which, particular|ly <HI>at this very Juncture,</HI> very much depends upon it.</P>
<P>I am not at all entring here, upon the Obligation of the &s;everal Convenants, engaged in by the People of <HI>Scotland;</HI> 'Tis nece&s;&s;ary here, for Argument &s;ake, to allow them to be Obligatory, in as large a Sen&s;e as can be de&s;ired.</P>
<P>As to the being Obliged to Reform the Church of CHRIST in the whole I&s;land;&mdash;It is granted here, by the mo&s;t &s;evere A&s;&s;ertors of the Covenants Obligation.</P>
<P N="1">1. That, <HI>as is expre&s;s'd,</HI> they are to u&s;e all lawful Means only; and that they are not to u&s;e any &s;uch thing as Force.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="250">
And the Reverend Doctor <HI>Rule,</HI> a Divine of great Candor and Learning, and Principal of the College of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> has &s;tated this Obligation very di&s;tiuctly, as follows,<Q>What we are bound to by the Covenant, is not to Reform them, but to concur with them, when lawfully called, to advance Reformation; And it is far from our Thought, to go beyond that Boundary, in being con|cern'd in their Affairs, we wi&s;h their Reformation, but leave the mana|ging of it to them&s;elves. <BIBL>Doctor <HI>Rule's &s;econd Vindication of the Church of</HI> Scotland, <HI>P.</HI> 16.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Now I think nothing is more clear, than that there is all the Room in the World for the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> to concur in a Na|tional Reformation, notwith&s;tanding the Union; Nay, they will be better Qualifyed for it, now than ever; in &s;o far as they will, I hope, always have the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of all Good Men in the South, both Di&s;&s;enters, and Church Men, to Encourage them.</P>
<P>As to the Civil Power of Church Men, or in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> the Bi&s;hops Voting in the Parliament, and its being declared again&s;t in the Co|venant; I will not Di&s;pute the Sugge&s;tion, whether it be again&s;t the Covenant or no, the Di&s;cord lyes here.</P>
<P>One Party &s;ays, it is expre&s;ly again&s;t the Covenant; and that the yielding to it, and yielding to have the Church of <HI>England</HI> e|&s;tabli&s;hed by the Treaty, is &s;etting up that very Power they were &s;worn to Reform, to the utmo&s;t of their Power, in all lawful Means; and the&s;e are the particulars, in which, they &s;ay, the Union is a Breach upon the Covenant, and has brought the Nation into the dreadful Sin of publick Perjury.</P>
<P>The other &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. They are not guilty of National Perjury; For that they con|ceive, the Union does no way oblige them further, than as before, in the Sen&s;e of Doctor <HI>Rule,</HI> to concur with all lawful Methods for Reformation, and to clo&s;e with all Opportunities, which &s;hall be put into their Hands for the Purpo&s;e; and this they are yet as free to do as before.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to their Con&s;enting to the Act for the Security, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> it is not again&s;t the Covenant, &s;ince it is not an Erecting a Church; Nay, it is not, in the lea&s;t, a Recog|nizing or Acknowledging them that are Erected;&mdash;but 'tis a letting <HI>that be,</HI> which <HI>was before,</HI> and which they had no lawful Call, <HI>the Thing expre&s;ly mentioned in the Covenant,</HI> to concern them&s;elves in Altering; They were not legally called to it, for they were legal|ly, at this time, excluded on either &s;ide, from meddling in the re&s;pective Settlements of the Church, by the Queens Power.</P>
<P>And, at la&s;t, they alledge, that, in &s;o far as the Covenant en|gages them again&s;t the Civil Power of Church Men, they did ex|onerate them&s;elves fairly, in their publick Prote&s;t again&s;t the Votes of the Bi&s;hops, <HI>viz.</HI> The Repre&s;entation and Petition, Rejecting, as far as in them lyes, all Submi&s;&s;ion to their &s;aid Power; and that they conceive, being not called to any other oppo&s;ition, they
<PB N="40" REF="251">
have fully di&s;charged their Duty as a Nation, and have, to the ut|mo&s;t of their Power, oppo&s;ed it.</P>
<P>I think, this is a clear, tho' a &s;hort State of the Que&s;tion; And &s;ome of the mo&s;t Con&s;cientious and Pious, of both Mini&s;ters and People, on one &s;ide, thought the Ca&s;e of the Covenant clear in this Point.</P>
<P>I know, there are others dis&s;atisfied &s;till, of whom I have only this to &s;ay, If they are certain it is a National Crime, I wi&s;h they would apply them&s;elves to National Humiliation, and be found of them that &s;tand in the Gap, to prevent GOD's Judgments, rather than forgetting that part, fill the Days with their Complaint of the Sin,&mdash;and only apply it, to make the People unea&s;y at the Occa|&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Union is fini&s;ht: Even breaking it again, if that were in their Power, would not undo the Crime, if it be one; and would, at the &s;ame time, involve their Country in a Thou&s;and Calamities, Blood and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>I cannot be &s;o Uncharitable, as to think, any Man that rai&s;es the Scruple we are now upon, would be willing to be thought to be moving the Nation, to break this New, and mo&s;t Solemn Conjunc|tion, and fall all to pieces again: I would then ask, To what end are publick Exclamations, and Excur&s;ions of the Tongue about it? They can tend to nothing, but to keep the People in a continual Alarm, keep their Minds in a con&s;tant Perturbation and Unea&s;i|ne&s;s; and 'tis a &s;ad Work for any Man to be employed in, meerly to di&s;turb and di&s;tract his Country.</P>
<P>While the&s;e things were debating at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> the Affair grew &s;till darker and darker all over the Kingdom; and they were far from carrying it with equal Temper and Moderation in other Places.</P>
<P>In the We&s;t, the People, called <HI>Cameronians,</HI> began to be appre|hended as Dangerous, and that Cloud was diligently repre&s;ented as very Black; That, according to the Ra&s;h Wi&s;hes of &s;ome People, <HI>who&s;e Endeavours too had not been wanting,</HI> they would fall into &s;ome De&s;perate Action or other on this Account;&mdash;The Prejudices a|gain&s;t the Union had reach'd them very early: Nor was it to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that tho&s;e People, who were &s;o diligent to Alarm the Country every where again&s;t the Union, and po&s;&s;e&s;s'd them with Fears and Jealou&s;ies of their Liberties, Trade, Crown, and Religi|on, would fail to fall to Work in the&s;e Parts, where they mu&s;t needs know, the general Character of the People, was to be Tenacious of their Opinions; and far from being always pre&s;cribed by the mo&s;t Prudent and Moderate Councils;&mdash;As to other Places, the Arguments were &s;uited to the People, as to &s;ome, the Lo&s;s of Trade, to others Taxes, to the&s;e the Liberty, to tho&s;e the Sovereign|ty of the Nation, &s;o to the&s;e the great Pretence u&s;ed, was Religion, the Danger of, not the Church, <HI>for that many of them did not &s;ub|mit to or acknowledge;</HI>&mdash;But Religion in general, and the&s;e two Heads in particular, the Return of Prelacy, and the Breach of the
<PB N="41" REF="252">
Covenant; However, they had all the very &s;ame things in their Allegations.</P>
<P>In carrying on the De&s;ign of En&s;laving the&s;e poor People, great Artifice was u&s;ed;&mdash;And, as if they had been prepared for the De&s;ign before hand,&mdash;they waited till the Articles were printed, which were formed by the Treaters in <HI>England,</HI> and the &s;everal Mi|nuts of the Treaty.</P>
<P>When the&s;e were &s;een, a Number of the&s;e People got together; And tho they were not the Number by far, as was diligently re|ported, in order to make them Formidable; yet the Beginning might have been Dangerous enough, if it had been pu&s;h'd on far|ther; what Number they might really be in other places, I could ne|ver learn &s;o particularly, as to venture a&s;&s;erting it: But about Two Hundred Men, in a Tumultuous Manner, came to the Town of <HI>Dumfreis,</HI> a Sea-port on the We&s;t-&s;ide of <HI>Scotland,</HI> about Twen|ty Eight Miles from <HI>Carli&s;le;</HI>&mdash;They came into the Town in the Middle of the Day, on the Twentieth of <HI>November,</HI> made a Fire in the Market Place, burnt the Articles of the Union, and burnt a Paper with the Names of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Treaty, and fix|ed another Paper of their own upon the Cro&s;s; and having done thus, they march'd off, and di&s;pers'd them&s;elves peaceably.</P>
<P>This Paper indeed was no le&s;s Seditious in its Nature, than the Attempt was In&s;olent and Daring.</P>
<P>When the Report came to <HI>Edinburgh</HI> of this Tumult, the Concern of tho&s;e, who wi&s;h'd well to their Country, was very great, and Wi&s;e Men began to give the De&s;ign of the Treaty for lo&s;t; They knew the unhappy Temper of tho&s;e Hone&s;t People; for &s;uch, how|ever, I mu&s;t call them, becau&s;e I believe their Intention is Religious and Hone&s;t, tho they may be mi&s;taken, and, no doubt, are mi&s;ta|ken, in their Principles, about Government and Obedience; But, as they knew, I &s;ay, the Temper of the&s;e People, how Tenacious of their own Sentiments, and how Precipitant in their Pro&s;ecution, it bred no &s;mall Concern in the Minds of all People, who were in|clin'd to Peace; Concluding, That the Party, who oppo&s;ed the Union from wor&s;e Principles, had gain'd their Point, <HI>viz.</HI> To im|ploy the Hands of Prote&s;tants, one again&s;t another, in this Di&s;pute, and make the Hone&s;t Meaning, but Warm People, the Tools to Ruine both them&s;elves, and their Country.</P>
<P>There were not wanting, at the &s;ame time, People, who dili|gently &s;pread Extravagant Rumours of the Numbers of the&s;e People; Some &s;aid, that there were Six Thou&s;and Men in Arms at the Place; others, that Two Thou&s;and Hor&s;e only came into the Town; and that Five Thou&s;and Foot-&s;tood ready, in the Hill Country, to March with them, as Occa&s;ion &s;hould require: Others, that the whole Bo|dy of them were up; and that the whole We&s;t was in Arms, and at lea&s;t Twelve Thou&s;and of them were to March for <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> to rai&s;e the Parliament; and that they had publickly declared, they would Sacrifice the Treaters, as Betrayers of their Country, and Sel|lers of her Liberty and Sovereignty.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="253">
To back the&s;e Reports, the Paper they fix'd up at <HI>Dumfreis</HI> was officiou&s;ly printed; and at the End of it, a Po&s;t&s;cript, &s;ignifying, <HI>That this Paper was publickly read from the Market Cro&s;s at</HI> Dumfreis, <HI>about one of the Clock Afternoon, on the Twentieth of</HI> November <HI>One Thou&s;and Seven Hundred and Six, with great Solemnity, in the Audi|ence of many Thou&s;ands; the Fire being &s;urrounded with double Squa|drons of Hor&s;e and Foot in Martial Order.</HI></P>
<P>The printing of this Paper was re&s;ented by the Government, and the Printer fled from their Hands for the pre&s;ent; but this, as all other In&s;ults of this Nature, were no farther pro&s;ecuted, the Govern|ment choo&s;ing rather to pity and overlook the Follies of the People, on this Occa&s;ion, as what they &s;aw was politickly Enflamed by a Party, who only &s;ought to Embroil the Nation, and bring the be&s;t of the People to fall out with one another, that the Game might be made up out of the De&s;truction of both.</P>
<P>By this Po&s;t&s;cript above, may appear to any Unbya&s;s'd Per&s;on, the Artifice made u&s;e of, to magnify every Story, to encrea&s;e the Terror of the People, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to encourage the like Confu|&s;ions in other Places; For, as to the Fact, 'tis true, there were a Rabble of Country People, to the Number, as above, of about Two Hundred; I could never find, that they de&s;erved to be called more;&mdash;That there was any &s;uch thing, as Squadrons or Com|panies, either of Hor&s;e or Foot, or any Martial Order, &s;uch as Offi|cers or Commanders, or any thing like Troops, was a manife&s;t For|gery, on purpo&s;e to Amu&s;e the Nation, and make the People Be|lieve, what they really had &s;ome Ground to Fear.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t al&s;o do tho&s;e People in the We&s;t this Ju&s;tice, that, tho great Endeavours had been u&s;ed to Exa&s;perate them, and they were heartily again&s;t the Union, as appear'd, upon all Occa&s;ions;&mdash;But when they came to &s;ee a little into the Hands that were at Work again&s;t it, and with whom they were like to joyn, even the Hotte&s;t among them came to them&s;elves, and to give them their Due, they behaved with great Calmne&s;s and Di&s;cretion; nor could they be brought into any Precipitations or Extravagancies, as was dayly threatned;&mdash;Mr. <HI>John Hepburn,</HI> their chief Leader and Mini&s;ter, had been Reflected on, as one that had Inflamed and Animated them to ri&s;e and take Arms, and that had been &s;aid to threaten the Parliament;&mdash;when he was Di&s;cour&s;ed with by &s;ome, who were under Concern for the publick Peace, it di&s;covered the Frauds and Fal&s;ities of tho&s;e Sugge&s;tions, and how they were &s;pread about to &s;erve the great end of the publick Di&s;orders, and only amu&s;e the World; for he declared him&s;elf readily, that indeed they had Ap|prehen&s;ions, that the Union would be prejudicial to them; that they did not like the Articles, and thought the Treaters had not done their Duty, and the like; but that, as to their having any De&s;ign to di&s;turb the Government, or to appear in Arms, it was an Abu&s;e upon them; They had no &s;uch Thought, nor &s;hould they do any thing, but in a National Way; much le&s;s would they adhere to,
<PB N="43" REF="254">
or encourage the De&s;igns of a <HI>Jacobite French</HI> Party, whom, he de|clared, they abhorred, and would never joyn with.</P>
<P>I think this is a plain Demon&s;tration of the Truth of what I have alledged all along this Story, <HI>viz.</HI> That there was a bu&s;y Party, who run thro' the whole Country, by all po&s;&s;ible Artifice, to Agi|tate and Di&s;turb the Minds of the peaceable People; and, if po&s;|&s;ible, to bring them fir&s;t to mi&s;taken Notions about, and Aver&s;ions to the Union in general; and then, to pur&s;ue tho&s;e Aver&s;ions, by all po&s;&s;ible Methods of Di&s;traction and Confu&s;ion; and that this might bring the Hone&s;t and Well-meaning People of the Nation, either by their Numbers and Intere&s;t, to overthrow the Treaty; or, by their Folly and Mi&s;carriage, to overthrow them&s;elves, and &s;o to weaken both.</P>
<P>But GOD's Goodne&s;s to this Innocent People di&s;appointed them here, and we never found the lea&s;t Tumult or Di&s;order on this &s;ide afterward, to the particular Mortification of the Party that hoped for wor&s;e things from them.</P>
<P>The Declaration therefore, or Prote&s;t, which they po&s;ted up at <HI>Dumfries,</HI> and which the Party handed about at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> as a great In&s;tance of what they hoped for from them, is rather publi&s;hed here, as an Example of the Notions they had poi&s;oned the Minds of the People with, than as the Sen&s;e of the Nation, in the Ca&s;e of the Union, and a Sketch of what they endeavoured to obtain from all the re&s;t, <HI>Appendix, N. E. x.</HI></P>
<P>We are now, in the Proce&s;s of this Affair, come on to the middle of <HI>November;</HI>&mdash;I mu&s;t de&s;ire the Reader, to go back a little to the Parliament; They had begun to read the Articles the &s;econd time, in order to Vote on them; The beginning was a remarkable Debate, and held for &s;everal days, as will appear in the Minuts.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Article was like putting the previous Que&s;tion, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether there &s;hould be an Union with <HI>England,</HI> in the Sen&s;e of the pre&s;ent Articles, or no: That is, whether there &s;hould be an Incorporate Union of the Nation into one Kingdom, to have but one Name, Head, Signature, Con&s;titution and Parliament, Yea or No.</P>
<P>The Manner of this Que&s;tion, and the Difficulty with which it was carried in the Hou&s;e, I refer to the Minuts, <HI>Folio</HI> But I cannot but ob&s;erve one &s;ignificant <HI>Omen</HI> of the future good Succe&s;s of this Treaty, and which, I mu&s;t owne, very much encouraged me to think it would go on, notwith&s;tanding all the vigorous Oppo&s;ition it met with, was, That it was Voted on the mo&s;t remarkable Day for Publick Deliverance, that ever happened to this I&s;land. I am as far from laying any Stre&s;s on &s;uch in&s;ignificant Circum&s;tances, as any Man; and I know, they can have no Efficiency in the bring|ing to pa&s;s the mighty Events, which may be u&s;her'd &s;o into the World; and therefore I be&s;peak the Reader to note this, not as a thing I lay any real Weight upon.</P>
<P>And yet it was impo&s;&s;ible to ob&s;erve, without &s;ome Emotion of the Mind, and without &s;ome Pre&s;age of the good I&s;&s;ue of this Matter;
<PB N="44" REF="255">
That the fir&s;t Article, being the Great and E&s;&s;ential Part of the U|nion, was Voted and Approved on that remarkable 4<HI>th</HI> Day of <HI>No|vember,</HI> which was made happy to <HI>Britain; Fir&s;t,</HI> By the Birth of the Great and Immortal King <HI>William,</HI> to whom the&s;e Nations owe &s;o much, that they cannot look on their Church Re&s;tored, the Bloody Per&s;ecuting Race of Tyrants Abdicated and Fled, Cruelty and Prelacy Dethroned, and all the Mi&s;chiefs of a Ruin'd Nation Vani&s;hed, and not Ble&s;s the Memory of that Great Agent of GOD's Goodne&s;s to them, without remarkable Ingratitude both to GOD Him&s;elf the Original, and to that Glorious In&s;trument of our Feli|city the King;&mdash;Nor was it this alone, which rendered this Day remarkable to us, but al&s;o, that the great and remarkable Revolu|tion of <HI>Britain</HI> formed in, and founded upon the Expedition of the &s;ame King <HI>William,</HI> bears Date from this Time, being the Day which he fir&s;t Landed on at <HI>Torbay</HI> in the We&s;t of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>It could not but be a plea&s;ant Reflection to tho&s;e, who remem|bred the particulars of the&s;e things, to find, that, without any pre|vious Calculation, or Direction of Men, the Concurrence of Cau&s;es &s;hould &s;o effectually jump, for the bringing to pa&s;s the mo&s;t remar|kable Tran&s;actions of <HI>Britain's</HI> E&s;tabli&s;hment on the &s;ame Day; That her Deliverance from Tyranny, and the many many Oppre&s;&s;i|ons of a mo&s;t Cruel and Barbarous Generation, that Aim'd at Sup|pre&s;&s;ing the Foundations of Liberty, and Overthrowing the Con&s;ti|tution of both Kingdoms;&mdash;And her Deliverance from private Antipathies, the Peace of her Inhabitants, and the great Conjuncti|on, <HI>WE HOPE,</HI> of the Hearts and Affections of Two Nations, which, for many Years, had been filled with the mo&s;t Fatal and Inveterat Aver&s;ions, &s;hould take their Ri&s;e together, and Date their Beginning both on the &s;ame Fourth of <HI>November;</HI> and both on that very Day, when the Great In&s;trument of her Deliverance, by whom &s;he was put in a Condition to bring all the re&s;t to pa&s;s, was born into the World.

<P>It was, on this Happy Day, that the fir&s;t Article of the Union was pa&s;s'd in the Parliament, after Infinite Struggles, Clamour, Railing, and Tumult of a Party; who, however they endeavour|ed to Engage the Hone&s;t Scrupulous Part of the People with them, yet gave this Eminent Di&s;covery of the Principles of their own Actings, in that there was an Entire Conjunction of the <HI>Jacobite,</HI> the <HI>Prelatick,</HI> and the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t, in this particular; and the very Di&s;covery of this, opened the Eyes of a great many People, who, in the Simplicity of their Hearts, had joyned in the general Oppo&s;ition to the Union; but, when they &s;aw the Tendency of Things, and whither it all led, when they &s;aw the Society they

were going to Embark with; when they &s;aw the Enemies of the Prote&s;tant Settlement all Engag'd, and the&s;e very People, who had filled the Land with the Groans of Oppre&s;&s;ion, and the Cries of Blood,&mdash;coming to Joyn Hands with them, again&s;t an Union with <HI>England;</HI> when they &s;aw, that, to &s;hun an Union with Chri|&s;tians, they were, of Nece&s;&s;ity, to come into an Union with De|vils; Men that had Transformed them&s;elves into the very In|fernal Nature, and vi&s;ibly Acted from Principles, in this particular Diabolical, in that they Tended to Erect the Ab&s;olute Subjection of Nations to the Lu&s;t, and Unbounded Appetites of Lawle&s;s Ty|rants; when they &s;aw the&s;e things &s;o plainly, we then found an Alte|ration, and the be&s;t, the mo&s;t thinking, and mo&s;t Judicious People, began fir&s;t to &s;top, and con&s;ider, and afterward wholly to withdraw from the Party; and the Clamour of the People, as if come to a <HI>Cri&s;is,</HI> began not to be &s;o univer&s;al, but to abate; and the more it did &s;o, the more the &s;ecret Party, who lay at the Bottom of all the re&s;t, began to appear, and di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Article being pa&s;t, the Hopes of the Party depended upon Debating the Matters of Taxes, Exci&s;es, Cu&s;toms; and, as far as po&s;&s;ible, &s;etting up the Popular Arguments of Care for the Poor,&mdash;the Impo&s;&s;ibility of paying Duties, the Incapacity of the Trade to &s;upport Exci&s;es and Cu&s;toms, and the like; and here they had Recour&s;e from one Shift to another, and, like True Souldiers, tho in a Bad Cau&s;e, they fought their Ground by Inches.</P>
<P>From Article to Article, they Di&s;puted every Word, every Clau&s;e, Ca&s;ting Difficulties and Doubts in the way of every Argument, Twi&s;ting and Turning every Que&s;tion, and continually Starting Objections to gain Time; and, if po&s;&s;ible, to throw &s;ome Un|&s;urmountable Ob&s;tacle in the way.</P>
<P>The Con&s;equence of this was, making Amendments to the Ar|ticles; Nor was it a &s;mall Di&s;appointment to them, when they &s;aw the Parliament willing to come into Amendments; and when, by the Prudence of the Committee, Appointed to make Calculati|ons, and Examine tho&s;e already made, it appeared, that their Ob|jections were either An&s;wer'd and Confuted, or the Clau&s;es &s;o Recti|fied and Amended, as that they had no more Room to fa&s;ten any of their Cavils; They were intirely Defeated, and the Di&s;a&s;ter was particular in this, that it &s;hew'd &s;till the more plainly to the World, that their De&s;ign was not to be &s;atisfied in the Amendment, and Alteration of what they Objected again&s;t; but, in having &s;omething to demand, that would not, or could not have been reconciled.</P>
<P>This cau&s;ed a great many Trifling Emendations to pa&s;s, which, in them&s;elves, had not Signification enough, either to de&s;erve the Name of Objections, or to need any Di&s;puting.</P>
<P>'Tis evident, the De&s;ign was to load the Treaty with a Multitude of Amendments; Among which, it was to be hoped, &s;ome-might be found, which the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> would Scruple; or, at lea&s;t, that it would be a Precedent for the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> to Con&s;ider the Treaty, and make more Amendments; which being
<PB N="46" REF="257">
to come down to <HI>Scotland</HI> again, to be con&s;idered here, would bring another Sitting on of Cour&s;e; when, by Delays, the Time fix'd to the Fir&s;t of <HI>May</HI> might be elap&s;ed, the Sea&s;on of the Year ad|vance, which hitherto had not favour'd them for the Riots and Tumults of the Country; and, in this Delay, they might find fur|ther Advantages.</P>
<P>How their future Actions conformed to this Sugge&s;tion, and how they were, in every Step, di&s;appointed, is the next thing to be di&s;|cours'd on;&mdash;But I mu&s;t Adjourn it a little, and Return to the Af|fairs of the Church, which were, at this time, in equal Agitation, proportionably con&s;idered; and the Party who oppo&s;ed the Union, u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible Artifice to bring things into Confu&s;ion there, in which they di&s;covered a double Mi&s;chief in their De&s;ign, 1. To bring to pa&s;s the grand De&s;ign of Ob&s;tructing the Treaty. And, 2. if po&s;&s;ible, to make the Di&s;orders they aim'd at, take their Ri&s;e in the Churches Di&s;&s;atisfactions; by which la&s;t Thing, two other Ends would have been obtain'd.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. They would have fix'd the Scandal of all the Con&s;equences, even of their own ra&s;he&s;t Actions, upon the Church.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. They would have drawn in Multitudes of Zealous, but In|nocent People, to have pu&s;h'd on their De&s;igns blindly, imagi|ning they had been Acting for the Church.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>But, as before, &s;o even now, the Prudence and Steadine&s;s of the Mini&s;ters, in the Commi&s;&s;ion of the A&s;&s;embly, defeated all the wicked De&s;igns of this Party;&mdash;For tho there were, in the Com|mi&s;&s;ion, a great many Mini&s;ters, who were &s;incerely and heartily a|gain&s;t the Union,&mdash;yet they were not to be drawn in to Act with &s;o much Imprudence, as the Projects of that Party de&s;igned; and therefore, what ever of Heat, or unhappy Warmth, at &s;everal times, happen'd there; and which, at one time, was feared, would have gone higher, yet the Temper and Sincerity of the main Body, both Mini&s;ters and Elders, always over-ruled, and, in good time, &s;uppre&s;s'd it.</P>
<P>I have already given you the Addre&s;s, which the Commi&s;&s;ion of the A&s;&s;embly gave in to the Parliament, in order to obtain a Securi|ty for the Church.&mdash;This Addre&s;s effectually An&s;wer'd the End of the Mini&s;ters, in that it obtain'd a Vote in Parliament, <HI>Novem|ber</HI> 2<HI>d, viz. That, immediatly after the fir&s;t Article of the &V;nion was Voted, the Parliament will proceed to an Act for the Security of the Do|ctrine, Di&s;cipline, Wor&s;hip and Government of the Church, as now by Law E&s;tabli&s;hed within this Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>All this Time an Overture, or a Draught of an Act, Intituled, <HI>An Act for Security of the True Prote&s;tant Religion, and the Government of the Church, as by Law E&s;tabli&s;hed within this Kingdom,</HI> was Read, and Ordered to be Printed.</P>
<P>While this Overture was preparing in the Parliament; and after it was printed, there was no &s;mall Endeavours u&s;ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Minds of the People, that it was not a &s;ufficient Security for the Church.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="258">
There had been &s;ome Sugge&s;tions &s;pread, that the Parliament would put them off, without effectually &s;ecuring the Church; and all po&s;&s;ible Care was taken to improve this Notion, and the People were agitated on that Head, as much as po&s;&s;ible: Some &s;aid, the Overture ought to have been drawn up by the Commi&s;&s;ion, not by the Parliament; and that it was leading them on in the Dark, with a general Vote, that an Act &s;hould be pa&s;s'd, without letting the Church judge, what was &s;ufficient for her Security, and what not.</P>
<P>It was urg'd again&s;t this, That the Commi&s;&s;ion had mentioned in their Addre&s;s, the Heads in which they ought to be &s;ecured; and there was no doubt, but the Parliament would make that Ad|dre&s;s the Foundation of the Act of Security; That, if there was any thing wanting, they would have time enough to renew their Addre&s;s, for the adding &s;uch things, as they judged rea&s;onable; and that therefore they ought to &s;tay, and not Interfere with the Proceedings of the Parliament, who&s;e proper Work it was, to pre|pare their own Acts.</P>
<P>But this did not &s;atisfy &s;ome People, who in&s;i&s;ting on the Com|mi&s;&s;ions concerning them&s;elves in it; The Committee for Publick Affairs moved, <HI>October</HI> 25. in the Commi&s;&s;ion, that &s;ome Members might be appointed, to &s;ee what the Parliament Men had prepar'd for the Security of the Church.</P>
<P>This was the Time, in which the Debates in the Commi&s;&s;ion run highe&s;t, and when &s;ome of the Elders, taking Offence at the Warmth of &s;ome of the Mini&s;ters, withdrew them&s;elves from the Commi&s;&s;ion;&mdash;But wi&s;er and more moderate Heads interpo&s;ed, and prevented the ill Con&s;equences of the&s;e things, as will after|wards appear.</P>
<P>Upon In&s;pecting the Overture for Security of the Church, and Viewing the Provi&s;ion made there for &s;uch Security, the Members of the Commi&s;&s;ion, who were appointed as above, Reported, That there were &s;ome Difficulties remaining, which they de&s;ired might be Con&s;idered.</P>
<P>The&s;e Difficulties began a warm Debate in the Committee of the Commi&s;&s;ion, which were Reported as Con&s;idered by the Commit|tee; and are as follows,</P>
<P>1<HI>&s;t,</HI> That it would &s;eem, That the Sovereign of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> in the Coronation Oath, is to be Sworn to Maintain the Rights and Pri|vileges of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as by Law E&s;tabli&s;hed, without any Re&s;pect to the Church of <HI>Scotland.</HI> 2<HI>ly,</HI> That, by the Oath of Abjuration taken in <HI>England,</HI> obliging to Maintain the Limitations of the Succe&s;&s;ion, and Qualification of the Succe&s;&s;or to the Crown, the Taker &s;eems to be obliged to endeavour, to the outmo&s;t, the Seclu&s;ion even of &s;uch Prote&s;tants from the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> who are not of the Communion of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as now by Law E&s;tabli&s;hed there. 3<HI>ly,</HI> Several Difficulties being propo&s;ed, with relation to Oaths, it was di&s;cours'd, how a Bar may be put to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliaments Impo&s;ing Oaths upon the Mini&s;try and Peo|ple
<PB N="48" REF="259">
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Incon&s;i&s;tent with the Principles of this Church. 4<HI>ly,</HI> That the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> may be exempted from the Sacra|mental Te&s;t, in U&s;e in <HI>England,</HI> which &s;ecludes all from any Office in <HI>Britain,</HI> or Benefit from the Crown thereof, who are of the Com|munion of the Church of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and &s;ome other things, which was thought, might be unea&s;y, and of Dangerous Con&s;equence to this Church, if not provided again&s;t in the Conclu&s;ion of the Uni|on: And the&s;e things being Di&s;cours'd upon at great length, were again Referred to the Committee for the Publick Affairs of the Church, to be further Con&s;idered, and they to Report.</P>
<P>The Committee, to whom this Affair was Referred, Reported, That they have had &s;everal Meetings, and Di&s;cours'd at great length upon the Four Particulars relating to the Union, and heard &s;everal Mini&s;ters and others upon their Scruples thereanent; and likeways upon a Fifth Particular, That the Con&s;titution of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parlia|ment, where Twenty Six Bi&s;hops do Sit as Members, &s;eems to be Incon&s;i&s;tent both with the Principles of Presbyterians, and the Co|venants and Engagements of this Church and Nation.</P>
<P>It would be too long to &s;et down here, how the Commi&s;&s;ion was dayly Be&s;ieg'd with Clamours and Cryes, rai&s;ed upon the Jealou&s;ics of the People;&mdash;And how they were urged to all manner of im|proper Re&s;entment, upon the Allegation now rai&s;ed again&s;t the Security of the Church, as it was offered in the Overture: This De|bate ri&s;ing &s;o high, I think it not improper to print the Overture it &s;elf, as it was fir&s;t drawn up, as well as when it was with Amend|ments Engro&s;&s;ed; The fir&s;t Draught therefore you will find in the <HI>Appendix, N^o. F x.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall forbear entring here into any of the Heats and Indecencies which pa&s;&s;ed upon this Debate, &s;ince they came to no Extraordinary Height; and the Wi&s;dom and Forbearance on both &s;ides, prevent|ed the Evil Con&s;equences which &s;ome hoped for from them.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Addre&s;s of the Commi&s;&s;ion had its Birth in the&s;e Di&s;|putes; and tho the Enemies of the Union expected great Things from it, yet, as it came out quite another Thing than they de&s;igned, having been reduc'd to Shape, and &s;trip'd of all its Mon&s;trous Figure, in which it was expected to come into the World, it had two Con|&s;equences, which &s;erv'd to a&s;&s;i&s;t even again&s;t the Party, that pro|mi&s;ed them&s;elves &s;o much Good from it.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t,</HI> It convinced the World, That however it was &s;pread abroad, that the Commi&s;&s;ion would violently oppo&s;e the pa&s;&s;ing the Act of Security, as a Thing of no Con&s;equence, and &s;o put a full Stop to the Work; it was evident, the Commi&s;&s;ion was not to be Blinded by Out-&s;ides, nor Screwed up by Parties; but that, Calm and clear Sighted, they would go on, in all Ca&s;es, with the &s;ame Gravi|ty, Con&s;ideration and Temper, which they had &s;hown from the Beginning.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>ly,</HI> It obviated the great Debate about the Church here &s;ubmit|ting to the Epi&s;copal Juri&s;diction of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> or to the Votes and Suffrages of the Bi&s;hops in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, in
<PB N="49" REF="260">
that, tho they did not Interfere, or Pre&s;cribe to the Parliament, yet they Exonerated their Con&s;ciences, and the whole Church of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> by making, as it were, a Prote&s;t again&s;t it, as what they would not be under&s;tood to Comply with, either now, or by any Action in time coming, which &s;hould be the Con&s;equence of the Union.</P>
<P>Thus the Difficulties, tho re&s;olv'd to be pre&s;ented to the Parlia|ment, yet came out in a Mode&s;t and Humble Dre&s;s, &s;uitable to the Dignity, as well as Di&s;tance, of the A&s;&s;embly, to which, and from which, it was pre&s;ented; and yet it came out in a Dre&s;s, which &s;ome Gentlemen of the Commi&s;&s;ion, particularly of the Ruling El|ders, did not Approve of.</P>
<P>Some would have had this Addre&s;s been called a Prote&s;t, but the Moderation of that Reverend A&s;&s;embly cru&s;h'd that Motion; and after &s;ome Debate, it obtain'd the Title of the Repre&s;entation and Petition,&mdash;and was Re&s;olved on in the Commi&s;&s;ion the 8<HI>th</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> and the &s;ame Day pre&s;ented to the Parliament. The exact Copy of this Paper, you will find in the <HI>Appendix, N^o. G x.</HI></P>
<P>When this Paper was Agreed on in the Commi&s;&s;ion, the Earls of <HI>Rothes</HI> and <HI>Marchmont,</HI> Lords <HI>Polwarth</HI> and <HI>Forglen,</HI> Sir <HI>James Camp|bell,</HI> the Lairds of <HI>Jervi&s;wood</HI> and <HI>Ardkinla&s;s</HI> younger, and &s;everal other of the Gentlemen, who Sat there as Ruling Elders, Declared their Di&s;&s;ent, and Entered their Prote&s;t again&s;t it, taking In&s;tru|ments in the Hands of the Clerk of the Commi&s;&s;ion; and promi&s;ed to give in the Rea&s;ons of their Di&s;&s;enting, which accordingly they gave in on the 15<HI>th</HI> of <HI>November.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the giving in the&s;e Rea&s;ons by the Elders, the Commi&s;&s;ion appointed a Committee to wait upon the Elders; and to know, if they in&s;i&s;ted upon having their Rea&s;ons for Prote&s;ting Recorded; and to &s;ignify to them, That, if they did, the Commi&s;&s;ion would be obliged to draw up their An&s;wer to tho&s;e Rea&s;ons, and to Re|cord the &s;ame likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>The Committee never obtain'd an An&s;wer from the Gentlemen; in a Body; but as many as they met with, gave for An&s;wer, That they did not in&s;i&s;t po&s;itively on it, but left it to the Commi&s;&s;ion; either to Record it, and Form An&s;wers to it, or not, as they &s;aw mo&s;t proper.</P>
<P>The Committee having Reported this, the Commi&s;&s;ion did, at la&s;t, think fit to Record the Prote&s;ts, and the Rea&s;ons annexed, and drew up their An&s;wers to them, tho they waited two Months be|fore they entered it; which, becau&s;e they are very material to a right Under&s;tanding of the pre&s;ent Debate, I have annexed to this Work, in the <HI>Appendix, N^o. H x I x.</HI></P>
<P>I think the Rea&s;ons and An&s;wer are a &s;ufficient Comment upon this Text; and whoever plea&s;es to peru&s;e them, will &s;ee, that tho the De&s;igns of wicked Men pointed much farther, yet the Commi&s;|&s;ion, both Mini&s;ters and Elders, were wholly influenc'd by Prin|ciples of Peace, Honour, Con&s;cience, and the Good of the Church.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="261">
I know, &s;ome thought the Church went too far in this Affair, and e&s;pecially in the Matter of the Sacramental Te&s;t, which &s;eem'd a Thing perfectly remote to them, and what they could have no Concern at all in; And the Gentlemen, in particular, were yet more willing than the Mini&s;ters, to have let both that, and the Mat|ter of the Civil Power of the Bi&s;hops quite alone.</P>
<P>But if we &s;hall con&s;ider, how the Mini&s;ters were dayly be&s;ieg'd, <HI>as before,</HI> with the Importunate Violences of the People; How many among them really, thought this part in particular directly again&s;t the Covenant; and how, by fal&s;e Reports, many had been &s;o Impo&s;ed upon, as to Believe the Sacramental Te&s;t in <HI>England,</HI> extended even to the Members of Parliament, which &s;hould be &s;ent from <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>When, I &s;ay, they con&s;ider the Fears and Jealou&s;ies, which over|&s;pread all &s;orts of People; and how far the Artifices of a wicked Party were, at this time, in their Meridian, and had inexpre&s;&s;ible Influences on all &s;orts of People, they will, with me, admire, that the Commi&s;&s;ion was able to maintain their &s;teady Re&s;olution; How they Work't thro' tho&s;e Flouds, and kept the middle way with Temper and Moderation, to pre&s;erve them&s;elves from the Snares laid for them.</P>
<P>All the&s;e things con&s;idered, it was, in mo&s;t Peoples Opinion, a Victory gain'd, and the Party received a manife&s;t Di&s;appointment, even in this Repre&s;entation, in that the Commi&s;&s;ion could be brought to no Precipitations, as &s;ome People flattered them&s;elves they &s;hould.</P>
<P>However this may be the general Opinion, I know &s;ome People took ill the Length they went in this Affair, and thought they ex|ceeded their proper Sphere;&mdash;But, I believe, tho&s;e Gentlemen are very well &s;atisfied with the Unan&s;werable Arguments drawn from hence again&s;t tho&s;e, <HI>who, not content with this Length,</HI> thought to Upbraid them with Forgetting the National Obligation of the Co|venant, which they fairly quitted them&s;elves of by that Article, in which they declare Civil Places of Church Men to be not &s;ubmitted to by them, but again&s;t both their Covenant and Con&s;ciences, and &s;o have fairly Exonerated the Church from that Affair, which &s;tuck &s;o near her.</P>
<P>The Repre&s;entation was pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e, ju&s;t when the Overture for the Security of the Church was under their Con&s;iderati|on; and however it did not, at pre&s;ent, meet with a very favou|rable Reception, even by tho&s;e who were the Churches very Good Friends, who thought, <HI>as before,</HI> they run it too high, and al&s;o ill tim'd it; yet neither did the Gentlemen wholly omit the things reque&s;ted therein, tho they &s;eem'd to &s;leep for &s;ome time; but par|ticularly the Clau&s;e about the Valuation of Teinds and Plantation of Kirks, which they pa&s;s'd an Act for by it &s;elf: The Matter of Oaths &s;eems al&s;o &s;ettled in the Amendments to the Overture: The other, as the Matter of the Sacramental Te&s;t, and the Suffrages of
<PB N="51" REF="262">
Bi&s;hops in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, was &s;ilently let fall, as things they could, by no means, meddle with in the Treaty.</P>
<P>Here the Oppo&s;ers of the Union met with another Di&s;appoint|ment; For, had the&s;e Two Articles been in&s;i&s;ted on, they knew the Event would have been a Rupture of the Treaty, and their great End had been An&s;wer'd, <HI>viz.</HI> To obtain the Parliament to demand &s;omething, which they knew <HI>England</HI> could never grant.</P>
<P>Thus this Storm blew over, the Act of Security for the Church was Voted, and laid by to be annexed to the Articles, and made part of the Union, as &s;hall afterwards appear.</P>
<P>As this had made a great Noi&s;e in the A&s;&s;embly, &s;o it had been no le&s;s canva&s;&s;ed all over the Nation: Some condemned the A&s;|&s;embly in the main, and pretended to cen&s;ure them publickly, for engaging them&s;elves in Matters, that had &s;o plain a Tendency to breaking up the Union, and de&s;iring the Parliament to concern them|&s;elves in tho&s;e Affairs in <HI>England,</HI> which could really admit of no Debate in this Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>But, as if the Commi&s;&s;ion wanted the Authority of their Con&s;ti|tuents to back them in their Proceedings, and to ju&s;tify their Con|duct, the re&s;pective Presbyteries in the Country began to come in with Letters, or a &s;ort of Addre&s;&s;es, te&s;tifying their Approbation of what the Commi&s;&s;ion had done, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But the Commi&s;&s;ion diligent|ly avoiding every thing that was Tumultuary or Popular, gave a cold An&s;wer to them; as particularly, to that of <HI>Dumfermling,</HI> who &s;ubjoyning to their Approbation of the Petition their De&s;ire a|bout Fa&s;ts Publick and Private, as in a Time of Impending Dan|gers; The Commi&s;&s;ion Re&s;olved, That <HI>their Act about Fa&s;ts pa&s;t be|fore, did &s;ufficiently An&s;wer the Presbyteries De&s;ire,</HI> and &s;o took no notice of the re&s;t; which prudent way of Proceeding &s;topt that De&s;ign, which &s;eem'd to be only to make the Repre&s;entation as Po|pular as they could, that it might, on the one Hand, encourage further Petitions, and &s;econdly oblige the Parliament to come into their Mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>While this was thus carrying on in the Commi&s;&s;ion, the Country began to be very Unea&s;y, and Threatnings came in every day, of coming up in Armies and Rabbles, to rai&s;e the Parliament, and to de&s;ire, that the Church might be &s;ecured.</P>
<P>The Presbyteries of <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> and of <HI>Stirling</HI> &s;ent Letters to the Commi&s;&s;ion, containing Heads of Grievances, and repre&s;enting &s;e|veral things, which they de&s;ired the Commi&s;&s;ion to demand of the Parliament, for the Churches Security.</P>
<P>To this the Commi&s;&s;ion of the A&s;&s;embly an&s;wer'd, That they had done, or were now doing, all that was de&s;ir'd in their Letters.</P>
<P>An ill natur'd Motion was made in the Commi&s;&s;ion al&s;o, to &s;end Circular Letters to all the Presbyteries, to &s;end up their Members to the Commi&s;&s;ion, and a Committee was appointed to con&s;ider of it;&mdash;But this occa&s;ioned &s;uch Variety of Debates, That the Com|mittee could come to no Re&s;olution, but referred it back to the Commi&s;&s;ion, and there it dropped.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="263">
This was a plain De&s;ign to renew the Debates; and, if po&s;&s;ible, to bring the Commi&s;&s;ion to prote&s;t, or declare them&s;elves again&s;t the Union.</P>
<P>The Repre&s;entation was now before the Parliament, but, as yet, they took no notice of it; and it was apparent, That they pur&s;u|ed their Treaty, for &s;ome time, without any re&s;pect to the &s;aid Repre&s;entation; and indeed it was fore&s;een they would do &s;o, the Gentlemen ea&s;ily &s;eeing, that, if the&s;e things were in&s;i&s;ted, it was ju&s;t a Re&s;olution to break off the Union.</P>
<P>The other Party eagerly Reported about Town, That it was a Di&s;re&s;pect to the Church, not to regard her Solemn Repre&s;entation; and then the Con&s;equences of the Bi&s;hops Voting in Parliament were laid forth, and the Danger of the Church was now their general Di&s;cour&s;e: Some were alarm'd with this <HI>Chimera,</HI> That the Par|liament had not a &s;incere Re&s;pect for the Churches Safety; That the Gentlemen had no great Concern about the Matter, and &s;o the Church would be Expo&s;ed to her Enemies, by the Negligence of her Friends.</P>
<P>But the Commi&s;&s;ion &s;aw thro' all this; and having done what they thought their Duty, both for the Churches Security, and for the Exonerating their Con&s;ciences in the Ca&s;es they could not com|ply with, they re&s;olved to &s;tand &s;till, and leave the Con&s;equences of Things to-Divine Providence, without pu&s;hing at Things Im|practicable, or &s;uch Things as tended only to Divi&s;ion.</P>
<P>This Steadine&s;s of the Mini&s;ters broke all the Mea&s;ures of the Par|ty; Their Hopes to Embroil the Mini&s;ters with the Parliament va|ni&s;hed;&mdash;And the Di&s;cour&s;e of the Repre&s;entation or Petition began to grow old and die.</P>
<P>The Commis&s;ion had their Hands full of their Repre&s;entations of another &s;ort, about the Growth of Popery, the ill Practices of &s;ome of the Depo&s;ed Mini&s;ters, and the like, and &s;o it wore off by Degrees.</P>
<P>I mention, in this Account, the Prudence and Moderation of the Mini&s;ters &s;o often, not that I de&s;ign to write Panegyricks here, much le&s;s to flatter the Per&s;ons of the Mini&s;ters; but who ever knew the Management of that Time, and reflects back on the Particulars, will ea&s;ily joyn with me in this,&mdash;That there were &s;everal parts of Management practi&s;ed upon the Mini&s;ters, in order to ruine their Coun&s;els, be&s;ides what the Open Debates of the Commis&s;ion di&s;covered, and particularly &s;uch as follows,</P>
<P N="1">1. There was a De&s;ign, if pos&s;ible, to bring the Mini&s;ters into a general Declaration again&s;t the Union, as dangerous to their Li|berties, incon&s;i&s;tent with their Principles, and contrary to the Obli|gation of the National Covenant; <HI>Of this I have &s;poken in the Cour&s;e of the Story.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. There was a manife&s;t De&s;ign to bring them to a Rupture a|mong them&s;elves; and that, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;uppo&s;ing the Union &s;hould proceed, or not proceed, the di&s;agreeing Party might be brought to a breaking off, or dividing from the re&s;t, and &s;o form a &s;ettled &s;tated Di&s;&s;ent, or Breach in the Church;&mdash;Nor was this
<PB N="53" REF="264">
a thing of &s;mall Con&s;equence; For it was really big with a large Variety of Mi&s;chiefs, and very cunningly contriv'd; Snares were laid for the whole Body, not of the A&s;&s;embled Mini&s;ters only, but the Con&s;titution of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who&s;e De&s;truction was almo&s;t vi&s;ible in the Project, had it met with Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>Had the Union been compleated without the Concurrence of the Mini&s;ters in Commi&s;&s;ion,&mdash;either the Church Affair mu&s;t have been left out, or the Enemies of it would have always &s;aid, it had been &s;ettled without her Approbation, and con&s;equently the Settle|ment been both Imperfect and Illegal.</P>
<P>Had one Party declared for the Union, and another again&s;t it, and, had both tho&s;e Parties adhered to their re&s;pective Declarati|on, by any publick Separation as a Party, the Hou&s;e had been di|vided again&s;t it &s;elf, and the Con&s;equence would have been hoped for with but too much probability.</P>
<P>In this very Ca&s;e, the Prudence of the Mini&s;ters, I &s;ay, was re|markable, and next to the Wi&s;dom of Providence directing, was the only means of preventing the Mi&s;chief contrived: It is not to be doubted, but, in the Commi&s;&s;ion of the A&s;&s;embly, and among the Mini&s;ters without, there were men of various Sentiments, &s;ome a|gain&s;t, and &s;ome for the Union; But their Wi&s;dom was particu|larly &s;een in this, that however they differed in the debating things, they always concurr'd in every publick Act of the Commi&s;&s;ion, and made no Divi&s;ion for nor again&s;t it.</P>
<P>We find but one Prote&s;t in the whole Affair, which was in the Ca&s;e of the Repre&s;entation and Petition; and this began among the Ruling Elders, and continued there; for none of the Mi|ni&s;ters ever adhered to that Prote&s;t, but even tho&s;e that were again&s;t &s;ome parts of the Repre&s;entation, yet, &s;eeing them&s;elves out-voted, acquie&s;c'd; Nor was all the Repre&s;entation objected again&s;t by any Body;&mdash;It was a Paper, I doubt nor, &s;ome hoped to draw Mi&s;chief from, yet that Mi&s;chief had its Di&s;appointment effectual|ly, tho the Paper had its Succe&s;s, in being carryed on; for it ap|pea&s;ed the Minds of many, who, being &s;atisfied of having Exone|rated their Con&s;cience, acquie&s;e'd in other Ca&s;es with the more Free|dom; Nor was the Repre&s;entation in general without its Particular Rea&s;ons to be a&s;&s;igned for it, as is further expre&s;s'd in the Sequel of the Story: As to the Mini&s;ters in all other Ca&s;es, how warmly &s;oever they debated, and with what&s;oever Firmne&s;s the &s;everal Mini&s;ters adhered to their Opinions, yet they &s;ubmitted their Votes to the Plurality, and all things were carryed in a regu|lar and orderly way, to the great Di&s;appointment of their Enemies, and to the great Ea&s;e and Satisfaction of all good Men of every Opinion.</P>
<P>Nor &s;hould I do Ju&s;tice here to particular Per&s;ons, if I did not acknowledge, and record it to his Honour, That much of this is ju&s;tly due to the Prudence, Patience and Temper of the Reverend Moderator Mr. <HI>William Wi&s;hart,</HI> then Mini&s;ter of <HI>Leith,</HI> who was Moderator of the A&s;&s;mbly, and al&s;o of the Commi&s;&s;ion, and who
<PB N="54" REF="265">
acted the true Moderator in all the&s;e Di&s;putes wi&s;ely, Calming, Tempering, and with Difficulty enough, Reducing the warme&s;t Debates to a Method of Conclu&s;ion;&mdash;And I mu&s;t owne, he had a Task of no &s;mall Difficulty, tho he had, no doubt, the Con|currence and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Men of mo&s;t Candor, Temper and Judgment on either &s;ide, &s;ince it could not but be vi&s;ible to every Thinking Man, who had any Concern for the Good of the Church, that, to run any Differences up to a Head, could i&s;&s;ue in nothing but the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion, gratifie the Enemy, grieve all Good Chri|&s;tians, and in the end ruine the Peace of the Church.</P>
<P>And this Remark of mine is the more ju&s;t, in that I could not but ob&s;erve, that the Debates on the&s;e Affairs had &s;ometimes that unhappy Warmth, that they &s;eem'd to tend nece&s;&s;arily to a Breach; and to come to the very point, and Lookers on, of whom I was one <HI>with a &s;ad Heart,</HI> expected &s;omething Fatal, not to the Union only, but to the whole Church, mu&s;t unavoidably have follow'd every Debate;&mdash;and yet we always found cooler Thoughts pre|vailed, and wi&s;e Men yielding this way and that, continually main|tained a Harmony, in concluding what ever there was in debating.</P>
<P>Another piece of Conduct was very In&s;trumental to pre&s;erving the publick Tranquillity, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Mini&s;ters generally &s;peak|ing, kept the&s;e Debates out of the Pulpit; For tho all manner of Society was taken up with Di&s;putes of the grand Affair, the Pulpit was very free of it; I &s;ay, generally &s;peaking, what Indi&s;cretions there were, had not Influence enough on the re&s;t, to recommend the Example;&mdash;Particularly, I think it was a very great Wi&s;dom in tho&s;e Mini&s;ters, who were for the Union, and who had many Prompters to it, had the Government to countenance them in it, and Enemies enough to catch at it, if they had; I &s;ay, it was their Wi&s;dom that they forbore it;&mdash;And I think the&s;e happy Con&s;e|quences followed to prove it &s;o.</P>
<P N="1">1. It took away all pretence from tho&s;e People, who de&s;igned, in this unhappy Game, to play one part of the Church again&s;t the other, and &s;et up one &s;ide again&s;t the other more effectually.</P>
<P N="2">2. It took away the Ground of Pulpit Clamour, and kept tho&s;e People &s;ilent, who, had it once begun there, would have been loude&s;t by far in the Exclamation;&mdash;For, had one Party fir&s;t preached for it, the other would, of Cour&s;e, have preached again&s;t it, and &s;o the Pulpit been made a meer Stage of Contention.</P>
<P>But, on both &s;ides, the Mini&s;ters, as well on private as publick Days, let it generally alone; They prayed for Direction and Ble&s;|&s;ing on the Parliament, and on the Meeting of the Mini&s;ters, as tran&s;acting difficult and doubtful Ca&s;es, but avoided entring into Debates.</P>
<P>I think I do them nothing but Ju&s;tice therefore, in hinting, that the Temper and Calmne&s;s, with which the Generality of the Mini|&s;ters behaved in this nice Occa&s;ion, was very great, and contribut|ed very much to the quiet carrying on the great Work.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="266">
Soon after this, the Country Tumults came upon the Stage; and, as it was <HI>a Peculiar</HI> to this Treaty, that the very Methods taken to ruine it, concurred to pre&s;s it forward; &s;o the&s;e Tumults &s;erved to open the Eyes, and calm the Spirits of abundance of tho&s;e hone&s;t People, who were prejudiced before; who, tho they were willing to oppo&s;e the Union, as what did not corre&s;pond with their Opi|nions, and as they thought with the publick Good; yet, when they &s;aw it going to Arms, Rebellion, and Blood; and when they &s;aw <HI>this farther,</HI> that, in order to oppo&s;e this National Conjuncti|on, they were to joyn in a Civil War again&s;t their Governours, with their and the Nations known Enemies; Their Eyes began to open, and they &s;lackned very much, from that time, their Appearance again&s;t the Treaty.</P>
<P>This manife&s;tly &s;hewed the difference between the Men, who, in the Singlene&s;s of their Hearts, oppo&s;ed it, as apprehending it un|&s;afe for the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, and incon&s;i&s;tent with their National Engagements; and tho&s;e, on the other Hand, who oppo&s;ed it, as contrary and fatal to the Popi&s;h Succe&s;&s;ion of <HI>James</HI> VIII, as they called him, and the Epi&s;copal Hierarchy:&mdash;And the&s;e differed ju&s;t as the <HI>Two Harlots</HI> in <HI>Solomons</HI> time;&mdash;The true Mother of the Child cho&s;e to lo&s;e her Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him, rather than that the Child &s;hould be murthered; &s;o the&s;e faithful Friends to their Coun|try, however po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed again&s;t the Union by the publick Clamour; yet they would choo&s;e to &s;uffer the Inconveniencies they feared, ra|ther than &s;ee their Country involved in Blood, a Civil War break|ing out in the Bowels of the Kingdom, and Forreign Popi&s;h, or Ty|rannical Powers invading their Privileges, and pulling down all before them.</P>
<P>This will appear to be the Ca&s;e, in the farther pur&s;uit of the Sto|ry; and the &s;ight of this affected the Hearts of a great many of tho&s;e, who had any Compa&s;&s;ion for their Country; and from this time forward, the Commi&s;&s;ion met with le&s;s Di&s;turbance from the hot People on the&s;e Heads, but went on calmly, and with all the Temper and Moderation that could be expected.</P>
<P>The Letter from the Presbytery of <HI>Hamilton</HI> gave them &s;ome little Di&s;turbance, but it was &s;oon over; and their Circular Letter to Presbyteries, to endeavour to pre&s;erve the publick Peace, not only &s;hewed their own Re&s;olution to keep all quiet and peaceable, but di&s;couraged all Endeavours afterward to di&s;order them: Of which by it &s;elf.&mdash;</P>
<P>But things were now grown to a &s;trange Height; and the &s;ame Engines, who &s;o boa&s;ted of the Effects of the Repre&s;entation and Petition above &s;aid, &s;hewed them&s;elves not idle in their Manage|ment of Affairs abroad; for they carryed on the Di&s;contents of the People to all po&s;&s;ible Height.</P>
<P>And indeed the Ca&s;e of the poor common People of <HI>Scotland</HI> was very hard, in re&s;pect to their Share in the&s;e Matters; They are not the only common People in the World, who take Things by whole Sale; and who being inflamed with the Clamours and Ar|guments
<PB N="56" REF="267">
of the more knowing &s;ort, their Land-Lords, Leaders, Heads of Families, and, <HI>as they too properly call them, MASTERS,</HI> and alarmed with Out-cries of Dangers, and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es; which were to come upon them by the Union; Things which they could not An&s;wer, nor had any Rea&s;on to que&s;tion the Truth of, &s;eeing their great Men po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the Belief of them: 'Tis no wonder they were exa&s;perated to the highe&s;t Degree, and ready to attempt any thing, to &s;ave them&s;elves from the De&s;truction at Hand.</P>
<P>Again, they were not altogether the People, that were di&s;agree|able to them neither, from whom the&s;e Di&s;contents began; Had they been only the Epi&s;copal, or <HI>Jacobite,</HI> or Popi&s;h Party, that had &s;tarted the&s;e Things, a &s;hort An&s;wer would have opened the Eyes of the common People; and it had &s;ufficed to tell them, from whom their Objections came.</P>
<P>But when, by the Subtilty and Artifice of the&s;e Men, they had drawn in a great many of the Hone&s;t Well-meaning People of the Country, who were known to be well affected to the pre&s;ent Civil E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Nation, and zealous for its Religious E&s;tabli&s;h|ment; when the&s;e were &s;een among the Number of the Warm Op|po&s;ers of the Union, &s;haking their Heads at the Articles, and fright|ed at the terrible Con&s;equences, which were talk'd of;&mdash;Who can wonder, that the re&s;t of the People began to be unea&s;y, and that tho&s;e Unea&s;ine&s;&s;es, at la&s;t, broke out into Exce&s;&s;es, Madne&s;s, and Di&s;traction.</P>
<P>The People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> I &s;ay, are not the fir&s;t In&s;tance; How ea&s;ily it is to be impo&s;ed upon; and how readily a Mob is rai&s;ed by a Rumour. How &s;oon did the <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> put all <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> in an Uproar, when they made them believe their Wor&s;hip was in Danger by <HI>Paul</HI>'s Preaching; and that he not only invaded their Wor&s;hip, but had actually defiled the Temple. How readily did they lay hold of the Ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle, and had certainly Murdered him, if the Civil Authority had not, <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Military,</HI> re&s;cu|ed him out of the Hands of the Mob, and put the Ca&s;e in the way of a fair Hearing.</P>
<P>It was not for the poor People, to di&s;tingui&s;h the Original of Cau&s;es and Things, nor who was at the Bottom of the&s;e Rumours; it was not for them to di&s;tingui&s;h the Hand of <HI>Joab</HI> in all this; whether <HI>Jacobite</HI> or Papi&s;t was the Original of this Matter, was not for them to examine; They &s;aw their Superiors joyning in the &s;ame Complaint, and every Party &s;aw &s;ome of their re&s;pective Chiefs embark'd.</P>
<P>The common People could look no further; The Epi&s;copal Poor &s;aw their Curates Tooth and Nail again&s;t it; The Ignorant and Indifferent Poor, &s;aw their <HI>Jacobite</HI> Land-Lords and Ma&s;ters Railing at it; and which was wor&s;e &s;till, the Hone&s;t Presbyterian poor People &s;aw &s;ome of their Gentlemen, and &s;uch as they had remarked and noticed <HI>to be Hearty Presbyterians,</HI> yet appearing a|gain&s;t it;&mdash;Who then can cen&s;ure the poor depending, uninfor|med and abu&s;ed People?</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="268">
And how, but by the&s;e concurring Accidents, was it po&s;&s;ible, the poor deluded People of <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> and the We&s;t, could be drawn in|to Mobs and Tumults, in Gratification of that very Party, to whom they have been the very Antipodes, the Rever&s;e, even in all the Ages of the Reformation: By whom they had been Plundered, Rifled, Butchered, and Per&s;ecuted, in the mo&s;t Barbarous Manner, with Cruelties and Extravagancies innumerable; Will any Man &s;ay, the Men of <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> Famous for their Zeal in Religion, and the Liberties of their Country, even from the very Infancy of the Reformation, were now turned Enemies to the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and ready to Fight again&s;t her, in the Quarrel of their Bloody and Inveterate Enemies, the Papi&s;ts and <HI>Jacobites?</HI> It could not be.</P>
<P>Will any Man &s;ugge&s;t, That <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> had forgotten her &s;elf &s;o much, that the Blood of her Citizens and Inhabitants, &s;hed in the old Articles of <HI>Pentland,</HI> and <HI>Bothwell,</HI> and the Ravages made up|on her, and the Countries round her, after tho&s;e Unhappy Times, even to the Confines of the Revolution, were forgotten?&mdash;Will any Body think, the <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> Men had &s;o far forgot the Hi&s;tory of Twenty Years ago only, that they could now joyn with the Mur|derers of their Brethren and Fathers, and take up Arms in favour of their Mortal Enemies? No, No, Nothing le&s;s, It was all Delu|&s;ion and meer Artifice, the Party played the Presbyterian again&s;t the Presbyterian, the <HI>Williamite</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Williamite;</HI> and hav|ing &s;ubtilly po&s;&s;e&s;s'd a few Hone&s;t, but Deluded People, with the Frenzy of the Time, made them the Tools of their Projects, if po&s;|&s;ible, to bring them to pull down one another, that they might af|terwards, with the more Ea&s;e, devour them both.&mdash;</P>
<P>And this leads me of Cour&s;e into the Story of the <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> Rabble, which now came upon the Stage; and which, in its Turn, tho rai&s;ed with a differing De&s;ign, was one of the Proofs of GODs Providence, working every thing, <HI>how&s;oever pointed at the &V;nion,</HI> to Act for it, and further its Conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>They had had in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> continual Alarms of the Ri&s;ing of the People in the We&s;t and North parts, in order, by Force, to put an end to the Treaty, tho the People them&s;elves knew nothing of it, nor had any &s;uch De&s;ign: To day it was in <HI>Angus,</HI> to mor|row in <HI>Galloway,</HI> now at <HI>Stirling,</HI> then at <HI>Lanerk,</HI> then at <HI>Hamil|ton,</HI> then at <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> but nothing yet appeared; and &s;ome began to mock the&s;e Fears as groundle&s;s:&mdash;The Party made their different U&s;es of the Reports, to day enlarge them to terrify and amu&s;e, to morrow le&s;&s;en them again as meer Rumours, to le&s;&s;en the Watchfulne&s;s of the Government, and make them &s;ecure; but the De&s;ign was manife&s;tly to procure the Tumults they expected, by reporting they were begun.</P>
<P>That the&s;e Fears were not groundle&s;s, or tho&s;e Alarms meer <HI>Chi|mera's,</HI> may be &s;een by the Commi&s;&s;ion of the Kirks Circular Letters to the &s;everal Presbyteries, to de&s;ire them to keep the Peace, and to be earne&s;t to prevent &s;uch Tumults; To which the Presbytery of <HI>Ha|milton</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="269">
gave an An&s;wer, which &s;eemed to object again&s;t tho&s;e Fears as unju&s;t, tho it did not afterwards appear &s;o. <HI>Vide</HI> the <HI>Appendix, N. M.</HI></P>
<P>And now, tho in the Story of the <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> Rabble, I &s;hall be obliged to mention the unhappy Slip in tho&s;e Prudentials, which, as I have ob&s;erved, the Mini&s;ters, <HI>generally &s;peaking,</HI> behaved with;&mdash;I &s;hall not, however, offend any Per&s;on of common Charity, &s;ince I &s;hall be far from &s;aying, the Gentleman here did this with a De&s;ign to rai&s;e the Tumult that followed; much le&s;s would I &s;o much as &s;u&s;pect, that he could, in the lea&s;t, have it in his Thoughts, to gratify the Folly and projected De&s;truction of the Kirk of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> which, in all the&s;e things, was apparent enough in the &s;e|cret Party that pu&s;hed on the&s;e things.</P>
<P>As to the Ra&s;hne&s;s and Intemperate Zeal, or <HI>whatever other mi&s;ta|ken Foundation it had,</HI> producing the Heat and Warmth of the Ex|pre&s;&s;ion, I have the Charity to believe, he is convinced of the Er|ror of that; and &s;o, while I am obliged to repeat the Circum&s;tance, I &s;hall, as little as po&s;&s;ible, reflect upon the Per&s;on, being de&s;irous, in all Ca&s;es, rather to Cover than Expo&s;e the Unde&s;igning Failures of all Hone&s;t Men, as what they may be led into by Mi&s;take, but never pro&s;ecute, when their Judgments are better Informed.</P>
<P>But to come to the particulars of this Unhappy Story at <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> which I &s;hall relate with all the Impartiality po&s;&s;ible, and without Re&s;pect of Per&s;ons, both for the &s;ake of the Hi&s;tory, which 'tis ne|ce&s;&s;ary to Tran&s;mit faithfully to Po&s;terity; as al&s;o, for &s;etting things in a true Light, and placing the Guilt where it is ju&s;tly due, which, at pre&s;ent, is under&s;tood to the prejudice of that City in general; and of tho&s;e Hone&s;t Gentlemen among the Inhabitants, who had no Concern in it, unle&s;s it were to be In&s;ulted and made Unea&s;y by it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Unea&s;ine&s;s that I meet with among the People here, I mean that was particular, <HI>for the general &V;nea&s;ine&s;&s;es about the Treaty were vi&s;ible every where, as I have hinted already,</HI> was about Addre&s;|&s;ing.</P>
<P>Great had been the Endeavours of a Party of Men, all over the Kingdom, to bring in numerous Addre&s;&s;es to the Parliament again&s;t the Treaty, in order to fortify that Argument, which was now brought in, as a &s;trong Bar again&s;t the immediat Proceeding, <HI>viz.</HI> That it was again&s;t the general Inclination of the People; which you will find Moved in the Hou&s;e, upon the &s;econd Reading of the fir&s;t Article, as <HI>per</HI> the Minuts.</P>
<P>The Party at <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> had been very bu&s;y to per&s;wade the Magi|&s;trates to Addre&s;s, as the other Royal Burghs had <HI>many of them</HI> done; but the Magi&s;trates &s;hewing no Inclination to it, they found there was no way to bring it about, but by the common People.</P>
<P>Nor could all their Credit with the common People bring it to pa&s;s; the In&s;truments being chiefly <HI>Jacobites,</HI> Papi&s;ts, and Epi&s;copal Peo|ple, who&s;e Reputation and Intere&s;t in the City of <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> and parts adjacent, had always been but very low, and now lower than
<PB N="59" REF="270" MS="y">
ever; &s;o that, to effect their De&s;ign, they had Recour&s;e to the Po|licy of the Times, <HI>viz.</HI> Deluding and Impo&s;ing upon others, and this did their Work; for, had they not made u&s;e of &s;ome weaker Brethren, who had more Influence upon the People, they had never brought it to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>To bring in &s;ome of the&s;e, all the Popular Arguments mention|ed before were Improved; among others, the Danger of the Kirk of <HI>Scotland,</HI> I believe I may &s;ay <HI>in their favour,</HI> was not the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>Drawn in by the&s;e &s;pecious Pretences, the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party had the Plea&s;ure to ly by, and &s;ee their Work done to their Hand; and the People being &s;ufficiently Enflamed, they waited the I&s;&s;ue, when one Unhappy Indi&s;cretion, <HI>to &s;ay no wor&s;e of it,</HI> fini&s;hed all their Hopes, and brought to pa&s;s the Mi&s;chief they de&s;igned, in the be&s;t manner for them they could have wi&s;hed for.</P>
<P>Some of the Elders of the Church had privatly waited on the Provo&s;t, whether moved by their Mini&s;ter, or by the common People, or of their own Heads, I &s;hall not determine, tho 'tis not very diffi|cult to Trace it to its beginning; but 'tis apparent, the Mini&s;ter we are to mention, as well as &s;ome others in the Town, were very ear|ne&s;t for the thing; Their Bu&s;ine&s;s was, it &s;eems, to move the Pro|vo&s;t, that an Addre&s;s might be pretented to the Parliament again&s;t the Union; They might have commanded a Popular Addre&s;s among them&s;elves, but that was not what they de&s;ired, but an Addre&s;s in the Name of the City by the Provo&s;t, Baillies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Provo&s;t an&s;wered <HI>to this purpo&s;e,</HI> That he did not think it would be prudent for them to Addre&s;s at this time, that he had been at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and had con&s;ulted the Lord Advocat, and &s;ome of the City of <HI>Gla&s;gows</HI> be&s;t Friends, and all unanimou&s;ly advi&s;ed them a|gain&s;t it, and gave it as their Opinion, it was not their Intere&s;t to do it: Particularly he reminded them, the Parliament had but, the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion, granted them the Tax of Two Pennies the Pint; and if they &s;hould now appear as a Town in this Addre&s;s, it might urge them to Repeal their Grant, and the City might be a great Sufferer.</P>
<P>This was a very good Rea&s;on, why he &s;hould decline the Addre&s;s, if the Gentlemen had been in a Condition to hearken to Rea&s;on; for if the Magi&s;trates had Addre&s;&s;ed, they mu&s;t al&s;o have followed it with Rea&s;ons and Arguments openly as a Body, which, in &s;uch Ca&s;e, would have been, in all Probability, ill taken by the Parliament, if, <HI>as is very likely,</HI> tho&s;e Rea&s;ons had been &s;uch, as came in from other places, peremptorily Inhibiting their Proceedings, and Im|peaching <HI>their Power to Act,</HI> without Leave from their Con&s;tituents, which indeed was the thing now in&s;i&s;ted upon, and generally aimed at in the Project of Addre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>The Provo&s;t having thus, tho very calmly and re&s;pectfully, de|clined the Matter, the People appeared very unea&s;y, and &s;ome hot Expre&s;&s;ions had been let fall in Di&s;cour&s;e about the Town, That they would have an Addre&s;s one way or other; But one Unhap|py Accident &s;oon di&s;covered the Meaning of the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="271">
On <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the &leftblank; day of &leftblank; the Fa&s;t appointed by the Commi&s;&s;ion of the A&s;&s;embly was kept in <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> Mr. <HI>C&mdash;k</HI> Mini&s;ter of the Trone Kirk Preached from the Words in <HI>Ezra</HI> 8. 21. <HI>And I proclaimed a Fa&s;t at the River of</HI> AHAVA, <HI>that we might afflict our &s;elves before our GOD, to &s;eek of Him a right Way for us, and for our little Ones, and for all our Sub&s;tance.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall convince the Gentleman concerned, that this Account is not made for a Satyr upon him, 'tis too &s;erious a Subject; and when both he, and tho&s;e who heard him, reflects on, how much more his Unhappy Temper, at that time, forc'd from him, than I &s;et down here, all which I have by me <HI>verbatim,</HI> as he &s;poke it, he will, I &s;ay, be convinced, that I talk no more, than, in the Obligation of a Hi&s;torian to Truth of Fact, I am bound to do.</P>
<P>In the Conclu&s;ion of his Sermon, after telling his Hearers the &s;ad Condition they were brought to, and how forward <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> u&s;ed to be in the Hone&s;t Cau&s;e, he added to this purpo&s;e, <Q>Addre&s;&s;es would not do, and Prayers would not do, there mu&s;t be other Methods; 'Tis true Prayer was a Duty, but we mu&s;t not re&s;t there,&mdash;</Q> and clo&s;ed it with the&s;e Words, <Q>Wherefore up, and be Valiant for the City of our GOD.</Q></P>
<P>I am not at all apprehen&s;ive of having the Truth of the&s;e Words que&s;tioned, having received them from the Mouths of more than two or three of the principal Inhabitants of <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> who heard them &s;poken; and if the mi&s;placing a Word &s;hould be &s;natcht at, <HI>I venture to &s;ay,</HI> that this was the full Purport of the Expre&s;&s;ion, without the lea&s;t Variation; as to the Weak Good Man that &s;poke them, I will not &s;ugge&s;t, that he fore&s;aw the Con&s;equence of them, or had any &s;uch thing in his De&s;ign, tho it calls for &s;ome Charity to gue&s;s his Meaning; The kinde&s;t thing I can &s;ay of them, is, that he did not mean at all what followed, but &s;poke in his Ha&s;te; for GOD forbid I &s;hould &s;ugge&s;t he mean'd to rai&s;e a Rebellion, and to bring his Country into all that Blood and Confu&s;ion, which, if GODs Goodne&s;s had not prevented it, had certainly followed.</P>
<P>The Sermon ended about eleven a Clock, and the People were &s;o Enflamed before, that, by one of the Clock, the Mob were gotten together, their Drum was Beat in the Back-&s;treets, and all the Con|fu&s;ions we are now to &s;peak of followed.</P>
<P>The next day, the Deacons of the Trades, <HI>which is the &s;ame as in</HI> London, <HI>the Ma&s;ters of the Companies,</HI> followed with a meddling Number of <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">By Trade&s;men in <HI>Scotland</HI> is under&s;tood none but the meaner &s;ort of People, &s;uch as Shoemakers, Smiths, Butchers, Weavers, and the like, as in <HI>England</HI> are called Handycrafts, the Shop-Keepers, &s;uch as Mercers, Drapers, Grocers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are all called Merchants.</NOTE> Trade&s;men, came to <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">A Chamber in the Tolbooth, where the Magi&s;trates &s;it, and where the City Council a&s;&s;embles, and where the Provo&s;t generally is eve|ry Morning.</NOTE> the Council-Hou&s;e, and
<PB N="61" REF="272">
leaving the People below, the Deacons of Trades and &s;ome few went up to the Provo&s;t, and demanded of him very rudely, if he would Addre&s;s.</P>
<P>The Provo&s;t, tho &s;urprized with their manner, compo&s;ed him&s;elf, and, according to his known Calmne&s;s and Steadine&s;s of Temper, told them, that he was not &s;atisfied to Addre&s;s; and an Eminent Inhabitant of the Town, <HI>viz.</HI> The Laird of <HI>Blackhou&s;e,</HI> u&s;ed a great many Arguments with them, civilly to per&s;wade them to be ea&s;y and &s;atisfied, and not to promote any Di&s;orders in the City.</P>
<P>While they were thus Di&s;cour&s;ing in the Town-Hou&s;e, the Num|ber of the People encrea&s;ed without, and began to be Tumultuous; but as &s;oon as the Deacons came out, and Reported to them in &s;hort, that the Provo&s;t had refu&s;ed to Addre&s;s, the People fell a Shouting, and Raging, and Throwing Stones, and Rai&s;ed a very great Uproar.</P>
<P>And here the Deacons de&s;ervedly obtain the Title of the Rai&s;ers of this Rabble; for, had they related the Calmne&s;s, the Rea&s;on|ings, and the Manner, with which the Provo&s;t very di&s;creetly An|&s;wered them, the People might very ea&s;ily have been quietly di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed; but now it was too late, the An&s;wer, as it was given to them, was only in gro&s;s, that the Provo&s;t was Re&s;olute, and would not Addre&s;s.</P>
<P>Enraged thus, they &s;lung Stones at the Windows, and, as much as they could, In&s;ulted the Provo&s;t; but he found Means to with|draw, &s;o that they could not hurt him for that time.</P>
<P>In this Rage, they went directly to the Provo&s;ts Hou&s;e, got into it, took away all his Arms, which were about twenty five Mu&s;quets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Some few things were &s;tollen in the Throng, but that was not much: From thence they went to the Laird of <HI>Blackhou&s;e</HI>'s Dwelling, broke his Windows, and &s;hewed their Teeth, and thus the fir&s;t Tumult ended.</P>
<P>The Provo&s;t retired for a while out of Town, and the Laird of <HI>Blackhou&s;e</HI> al&s;o, not knowing what the I&s;&s;ue of the&s;e things might be.</P>
<P>I pay no Complement at all here, but a Debt to Truth, in not|ing, that the Provo&s;t of <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> for that time, <HI>&leftblank; Aird</HI> E&s;quire, was an Hone&s;t, Sober, Di&s;creet Gentleman, one that had always been exceedingly Beloved, even by the common People, particular|ly for his Care of, and Charity to the Poor of the Town; and, at another time, would have been the la&s;t Man in the Town they would have In&s;ulted.</P>
<P>I mention this to obviate the Suppo&s;ition, that the Rabble took this Occa&s;ion to In&s;ult him, upon former Re&s;entments, as has been u&s;ual in like Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>The Provo&s;t being withdrawn, and the Addre&s;s they de&s;igned thus baulk'd.</P>
<P>They &s;et it on Foot without him, and indeed they effectually An|&s;wered the Magi&s;trates De&s;ire, who re&s;olved, if there was an Ad|dre&s;s, it &s;hould be a meer Mob Addre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="273">
Many a mean Step they took to get Hands, by Threatning, Af|frighting, and Hurrying People into it, Taking Youths and meer Childrens Hands to it.</P>
<P>Every Man that refu&s;ed to &s;ign it, was Threatned to be Rabbled, and have his Hou&s;e Plundered, which made a great many Timorous People &s;ign it, that did not approve of it.</P>
<P>This being the Method, it may ea&s;ily be imagined, the Addre&s;s was not many days a fini&s;hing; and &s;uch as it was, they &s;ent it away by four of the Town&s;men, whereof the fir&s;t two <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Robert Scot Deacon of the Taylors, <HI>&leftblank; Steven&s;on</HI> Dea|con of the Shoemakers, <HI>John Bowman</HI> Dean of Guild, and <HI>John Ha|milton</HI> Gentleman, were the Four that went up to the Parliament with the Addre&s;s.</NOTE> were the Deacon of the Taylors, and the Deacon of the Shoemakers; The other two that went with it were Gentlemen, too well known to be &s;u&s;pected of de&s;iring any &s;uch kind of Tumultuous Proceed|ings, but complyed with their De&s;ire, in order to prevent wor&s;e Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>If the Multitude of Addre&s;&s;es, which have been boa&s;ted of, as a Declaration of the Aver&s;ion of the People to the Union, may be gue&s;s'd at by this, tho&s;e Gentlemen, who bring this as an Argu|ment, have &s;mall Rea&s;on to Boa&s;t, and need not be very Forward, to have the Particulars Examined into.</P>
<P>The Addre&s;s having thus been &s;igned, and &s;ent away, the Peo|ple begun to be quiet again, and the Tumults &s;eemed to have an end; The Provo&s;t, who had fled to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> came home again, and every one went quietly about their Bu&s;ine&s;s, till, a little while after, a new Occa&s;ion &s;et all in a Flame again, wor&s;e than it was before, and made it appear, who was at the Bottom of it all.</P>
<P>And here the Warm Gentleman, who, from the Pulpit put the Match to this Gun Powder, may &s;ee who laid the Train;&mdash;The Triffle of Addre&s;&s;ing was the lea&s;t thing they &s;ought for, tho that &s;erved a purpo&s;e al&s;o;&mdash;And the&s;e good People, who were drawn in to begin it, &s;aw no farther; but now it appeared to be all <HI>Jacobite</HI> and Papi&s;t at the Bottom; That Blood and Confu&s;ion was the thing they drove at, and King <HI>James,</HI> Prelacy, Tyranny, Popery, and all the Mi&s;chiefs this Nation has to fear from them, lay hid in the De&s;ign, as will pre&s;ently appear, and the poor Thought|le&s;s Multitude were only Hurryed into it, by a Conjunction of Mi|&s;takes.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Rabble had a Beginning as &s;mall as the fir&s;t, tho not &s;o &s;oon laid, becau&s;e the fir&s;t had only the Addre&s;s in View, and was managed by a few, that the Contrivers of tho&s;e Di&s;orders had Impo&s;ed upon, and Deluded; but this part was under the more immediat Conduct of the very Party them&s;elves, and was intro|duced as follows.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="274">
One of the Magi&s;trates <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">It was Baillie <HI>Hamilton.</HI></NOTE> of the City, had committed a <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The Fellows Name was <HI>Parker,</HI> a Loo&s;e, Vagabond, Profligate Fellow, of a very ill Character, a Spinner of Tobacco by Imployment, but a very Scandalous Per&s;on.</NOTE> Fellow to the Tolbooth for Theft;&mdash;He had, it &s;eems, been taken offering to Sale a Mu&s;quet, or &s;ome other things, which, it was made appear, belonged to the Provo&s;t of the City, and which was taken out of his Hou&s;e in the time of the Rabble above-men|tioned.</P>
<P>This Fellow lay in the Tolbooth for &s;ome time; but it was ob|&s;erved, that, in an Evening, there would be &s;everal of the common People at the Window, talking to him thro' the Grates of the Pri|&s;on;&mdash;The Provo&s;t apprehending, that the Impri&s;onment of this Fellow, might be a Pretence for a new Di&s;turbance, re&s;olved to di&s;charge him; but, that it might not &s;eem to be done for Fear, took a <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">This is called there a Bond of Pre&s;entation, and is all one with a &s;imple Recognizance without Bail.</NOTE> Bond of him, to appear again, when called for, and, among the re&s;t of the People, who came to talk with him at the Grate, was one <HI>Finlay,</HI> a loo&s;e &s;ort of a Fellow, who had formerly been a Sergeant in <HI>Dumbartons</HI> Regiment in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and who openly profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a <HI>Jacobite,</HI> a Fellow that followed no Em|ploy, but his Mother kept a little <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">The common Name for an Ale Hou&s;e, or Inn, in that Country.</NOTE> Change Hou&s;e at the re|mote&s;t part of the Town on the <HI>Edinburgh</HI> &s;ide.</P>
<P>The Fellow had given his Comrades an Account, that the Magi|&s;trates had taken a Bond of him; and the next Morning, this <HI>Fin|lay,</HI> and a Rabble with him, comes up to the Clerks Chamber, another Office in the <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">The Town Hou&s;e, in which is their Offices, and al&s;o the Pri&s;on for the City; It is generally like the Guild Hall of a City, or the Town Hou&s;e in <HI>England,</HI> &s;aving that the Pri&s;on is generally in the &s;ame Hou&s;e in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Tolbooth,</HI> where the Magi&s;trates meet, and there they demand this Bond of the Clerk, it being put into his Hands.</P>
<P>The Magi&s;trates willing to take away all Occa&s;ions of Tumult, and to leave them no Excu&s;e, ordered the Bond to be delivered up, for the Gentlemen Rabble had now the full Command of the Town.</P>
<P>But to let it be &s;een, that the&s;e were but &s;eeking Occa&s;ions, not|with&s;tanding the Provo&s;t had told them, they &s;hould have the Bond delivered up; and they had now no Rea&s;on but to be &s;atisfied, the Clerk having Orders to deliver it; They continued together, re|&s;olving to In&s;ult the Provo&s;t, at his coming out.</P>
<P>The Provo&s;t not imagining any Danger, having granted their Reque&s;t, comes innocently out of the Tolbooth, and went toward his own Hou&s;e; The Rabble immediatly gathered about him,
<PB N="64" REF="275">
Thru&s;ting and Abu&s;ing him, and not with Villainous Language only, but with Stones and Dirt, and &s;uch like thrown at him.</P>
<P>He would have made to his own Hou&s;e, but the Multitude increa&s;|ing, and growing Furious, he took Sanctuary in a Hou&s;e, and run|ning up a Stair Ca&s;e, lo&s;t the Rabble for &s;ome time, they pur&s;uing him into a wrong Hou&s;e; However, they &s;earched every Apart|ment to the Top of the Stair, and came into the very Room where he was; But the &s;ame Hand that &s;mote the Men of <HI>Sodom</HI> with Blindne&s;s, when they would have Rabbled the Angels, protected him from this many Headed Mon&s;ter, and &s;o Blinded them, that they could not find him: It is the Opinion of many of the Sober|e&s;t and mo&s;t Judicious of the Citizens, that, if they had found him, their Fury was, at that time, &s;o pa&s;t all Government, that they would have Murdered him, and that in a manner Barbarous enough; and if they had, as we &s;ay of a Bull Dog, once but Ta&s;ted Blood, who knows where they would have ended?</P>
<P>The Provo&s;t was hid in a Bed, which folded up again&s;t the Wall, and which they never thought of taking down;&mdash;Having e&s;cap|ed this eminent Danger, he was conveyed out of Town the next day by his Friends, and went for the &s;econd time to <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>The Rabble was now fully Ma&s;ter of the Town, they ranged the Streets, and did what they plea&s;ed; No Magi&s;trate dur&s;t &s;how his Face to them, they challenged People as they walk'd the Streets with this Que&s;tion, <HI>Are you for the &V;nion?</HI> And no Man dur&s;t owne it, but at their extreme&s;t Hazard.</P>
<P>The next thing they did, was to &s;earch for Arms in all the Hou|&s;es of tho&s;e, that had appeared for the Union; And fir&s;t they went to the Dean of Guild, and, upon his refu&s;ing to give them his Arms, they took them away by Force; They &s;topt here a little, but having given out, that they would &s;earch the Hou&s;es of all that were for the Union, the Magi&s;trates A&s;&s;embled, and Con&s;ider|ing, that, if the Citizens were Di&s;armed, and the Rabble po&s;&s;e&s;t of their Weapons, they might, in the next place, po&s;&s;e&s;s their Hou&s;es, Wives and Wealth, at their Command; and that it was better to Defend them&s;elves now, than be Murdered and Plunder|ed in cold Blood; They re&s;olved therefore to rai&s;e &s;ome Strength, to oppo&s;e this Violence, and accordingly ordered the Town Guards to be doubled that Night, and removed the place of Arms from the u&s;ual Guard Hou&s;e to the Tolbooth;&mdash;And that this Guard &s;hould be of Select Per&s;ons, &s;uch as they knew.</P>
<P>Accordingly Orders were &s;ent to all the Captains of the City Militia, that each of them &s;hould bring twelve Men with them, &s;uch as, they could depend upon, would &s;tand by them, to &s;ecure the Peace of the City; and this was be&s;ides the ordinary Guard.</P>
<P>This was done readily, and with great Secrecy and Celerity, the Captains of the Militia being Faithful Hone&s;t Gentlemen, brought their Men without any Noi&s;e, Beat of Drum, or the like, and leav|ing

<P>The Rabble, who had re&s;olved to be as good as their Words, were now gotten together; and whether they thought the Magi|&s;trates were met in the Council-Chamber, and &s;o they re&s;olved to begin with them; or whether they had Intelligence, that they were upon their Guard, is not certain; but about nine a Clock at Night they gathered about the Tolbooth, and &s;eeing a Centinel plac'd at the Top of the <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">The Stone Steps on the Out &s;ide where the Iron Rails are, and where the Officers &s;tand to read Proclamations or any Publick Acts.</NOTE> Stair, <HI>Finlay,</HI> of whom before, is or|dered to go up, and &s;ee what they were a doing, as he called it.</P>
<P>When he came to the Top of the Stair, the Centinel challeng'd him, and thru&s;t him back; but he comes on again, and thru&s;ts in with the Centinel, and gets by him.</P>
<P>At this Juncture, one of the Citizens, who was privately appoint|ed to meet as above, was ju&s;t coming up; and having pa&s;s'd as privately as he could thro' the Mob, who were at the Stair Foot to the Number of about 100, being a Select Party only, for the re&s;t were not then got together, was going up the Stairs; This Gentle|man &s;eeing a Fellow a&s;&s;ault the Centinel, boldly &s;tept up to him, and knockt him down on the Stair Head with the Butt End of his Mu&s;quet, and immediately calls the Guard.</P>
<P>The Guard immediately took to their Arms, and headed by one Lieutenant <HI>Lind&s;ay</HI> an old Soldier of King <HI>William</HI>'s, but now a Burge&s;s and Inhabitant of the City, they came down and drew up at the Foot of the Stair.</P>
<P>Some Pieces were Fired in the Street, but whether at the Guard or no, was not known; The Multitude was great by this Time, and being late at Night, it could not well be di&s;cern'd: But as they had all the Rea&s;on in the World to expect it, they fell re&s;o|lutely to Work with them, and Sallying upon the Rabble, they im|mediately fled and di&s;pers'd.</P>
<P>Having thus broke the fir&s;t Body of them, it was ob&s;erv'd, that they only fled from the immediate Shock, but &s;tood in Throngs under the <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">The new Buildings at the Cro&s;s have &s;mall Piazzas of Stone on both Sides, under which the Shops are, and the People may walk in wet Weather.</NOTE> Piazzas, and in the Heads of Clo&s;&s;es <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Clo&s;&s;es are the &s;ame with By-Lanes or Alleys.</NOTE>, to &s;ee what the Guard would do; and that, with one Hallow, they could all be together again in a Moment, whereupon a Party was ordered down <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">There are but four principal Streets which all meet at the Cro&s;s, and lead to the four Gates of the City.</NOTE> every Street to clear the Piazzas and Clo&s;&s;es, and &s;ee

<P>Had they been able to have renew'd this Guard, the Publick Peace had been maintain'd, and the whole De&s;ign of this Rabble di&s;ap|pointed: But it is to be noted, the&s;e Gentlemen were all Citizens, Heads of Families, and of the principal Inhabitants; The Com|monalty was univer&s;ally debauch'd, and not to be tru&s;ted, and the Gentlemen could not do Duty every Night, neither had all that were Zealous enough again&s;t the Tumults, either Bodies to bear the Fatigue of Soldiers, or Hearts to adventure; and tho&s;e that were Forwarde&s;t, could not be always in Arms:&mdash;This fir&s;t Piece of Work was on <HI>Saturday</HI> Night, the next Night they re|liev'd the Guard by the like Select Number, and all was quiet; for, while the&s;e Men appear'd, the Rabble dur&s;t not &s;tir.</P>
<P>On <HI>Monday,</HI> the Magi&s;trates Summoned the Town Council, and, &s;ending for the Deacons of the Trade&s;men, the thing propo&s;ed was, What Cour&s;e &s;hould be taken to &s;ecure the Peace of the City, and keep the Magi&s;trates and Inhabitants from Plunder and In&s;ult.</P>
<P>The Deacons of Trades, &s;ubtilly, and as appear'd, de&s;ignedly, at lea&s;t &s;uch of them as were in the De&s;ign, propo&s;ed, That this Select Guard &s;hould be omitted, and pretended to promi&s;e, That, if any Tumult happened, they would come to the Town Guard with their Men to defend the City; which, whoever ob&s;erves how well they performed, will think it no Breach of Charity, to &s;ay they never de|&s;igned it:&mdash;However, for this Week, there was no more Tumult, but the Mob reign'd Ma&s;ters, and <HI>Finlay,</HI> who now had made him&s;elf one of their Leaders, &s;et up a Guard at the Upper End of the Town near the Cathedral, as it were in Oppo&s;ition to the Town Guard.</P>
<P>This whole Week was &s;pent in Amu&s;ements, and rai&s;ing Reports of the Ri&s;ing of the People at <HI>Stirling,</HI> at <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and in <HI>Angus;</HI> and that a great Army of them was to Rendezvous at <HI>Hamilton,</HI> from whence they were to March to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> to rai&s;e the Parlia|ment: <HI>Finlay</HI> gives out, That he will March with all the Men of <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> to meet their Brethren at <HI>Hamilton</HI> on the &s;ame De&s;ign;&mdash;by who&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tance all this was done, the Government was too Merciful to make a narrow Enquiry, and &s;o I mu&s;t leave it as they did in the dark: Having brought the Folly and Madne&s;s of the poor People to &s;uch a Height, <HI>Finlay</HI> actually gets together about 45 Men, or that was the mo&s;t of the great Army he rai&s;ed; and on the <HI>Friday</HI> following, this Contemptible Wretch having made him&s;elf their Gene|ral, Marches out of the City with them for <HI>Hamilton;</HI> they were Armed with Mu&s;quets and Swords, &s;uch as they had taken out of the Ma|gi&s;trates Hou&s;es; and (wherever he procur'd it, for every one knows he had it not of his own) he Di&s;tributed to every Man a Dollar;&mdash;And thus in Arms again&s;t their Native Country, and the Pro|te&s;tant Religion, the&s;e poor Deluded People March'd away, under the Command of an Abject Scondrel Wretch, that openly profe&s;s'd
<PB N="67" REF="278">
him&s;elf a <HI>Jacobite,</HI> and that, with his Good Will, would have &s;een all the Presbyterians in <HI>Scotland</HI> ruin'd.</P>
<P>But to &s;uch a Pa&s;s were Things now come, and who can Account for &s;ome Critical Junctures, in which Men may be brought to ruine them&s;elves with their own Hands, and never &s;uffer them&s;elves to li&s;ten to the Cautions of their Friends.</P>
<P>The Town, tho' rid of <HI>Finlay</HI> and his Vanguard, enjoy'd not the more Peace, or were in le&s;s Danger, for the Mob that remain'd kept up their Guard, threaten'd yet wor&s;e things than had been done, and were afterward as good as their Words to a Title.</P>
<P>The Government, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, were con&s;tantly acquaint|ed with tho&s;e things, and their Forbearance had not a little hearten|ed up the Party that pu&s;h'd the&s;e Mi&s;chiefs on; However, being loth to come to Extremities, they tryed Gentler Methods fir&s;t, and the Lord High Commi&s;&s;ioner having laid it before the Parliament, they immediately pa&s;s'd an Act, Di&s;charging the Mu&s;tering of Troops in the Country during this Se&s;&s;ion, and a Proclamation was publi&s;hed again&s;t Tumults, and both the&s;e were &s;ent to <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> to be publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be noted here, That, by the Act of Security, any of the Nobility, Gentry, or Towns, might meet in Arms, Mu&s;ter and Ex|erci&s;e their Fencible Men, and the like, upon any Occa&s;ion of which they were Judges; which was done in order to make the Militia of <HI>Scotland</HI> more Serviceable, or as &s;ome think <HI>in Terrorem</HI> to Serve a Cau&s;e; but be that as it will, it may remain undetermined; but, at this Juncture, the Parliament fore&s;aw, it might be a Handle for the drawing together any Number of Men at &s;uch a Time as this, and might be dangerous to the Peace, wherefore they cau&s;ed an Act to be brought in to Repeal that part of the Act of Security, for &s;o long only as the pre&s;ent Parliament was &s;itting.</P>
<P>When this Act of Parliament and Proclamation came to Town, which was on the <HI>Monday</HI> after <HI>Finlay</HI>'s March, the Magi&s;trates a&s;|&s;embled about ten in the Morning, and cau&s;ed the Me&s;&s;enger that brought it to read it at the Cro&s;s; Accordingly the Me&s;&s;enger goes up to the <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The Head of the Stone Stair on the Out-&s;ide of the Tolbooth ju&s;t fronting the Cro&s;s, the &s;ame mentioned before where the Centinel &s;tood.</NOTE> u&s;ual place, and read fir&s;t the Act of Parliament, the Magi&s;trates were below, and the Officers attending as u&s;ual, and a va&s;t Multitude of People were got together to hear what it was, be|fore the Officer had done, the People began to make a Noi&s;e, and throw Stones at him; but however, the Man went on, and read out the Act, and began the Proclamation again&s;t Tumults; but he had hardly read the Title of the Proclamation, when the Stones came &s;o thick, there was no &s;tanding it, and the poor Fellow not a little Brui&s;ed was driven off the Stair.</P>
<P>Upon this the Magi&s;trates ordered one of the Town Officers to go up and Read, which he did as far as he could, but was in like manner
<PB N="68" REF="279">
driven off by the Fury of the Stoning: In the <HI>Interim</HI> of this, the Magi&s;trates had &s;ent for the Town Guard to protect the &s;econd Officer in Reading; The Officer of the Guard &s;eeing the other Officer abu&s;ed thus before their Faces, commands his Men to fall upon the Rabble with the Clubs of their Mu&s;quets, which they did, and knockt down &s;ome of them; but the Trade&s;men that were upon the Guard, in the very Action de&s;erted, and refu&s;ed to obey the Command of their Officers, which &s;o encouraged the Rabble, that they came on again with Shouts and Huzza's, and with Volleys of Stones they fell upon the few of the Guard that were Faithful, and drove them off from the Street.</P>
<P>The Officer that commanded them Retreated them into the Guard Hou&s;e, but this was not a place to be defended again&s;t &s;uch a Mul|titude, &s;o in &s;hort they broke in upon them and di&s;arm'd them, and well it was they came off without Blood,&mdash;&s;ome of them were very much Brui&s;ed with Stones.</P>
<P>The Rabble now flu&s;ht with Victory, were in a terrible Fury, and this was the mo&s;t Outragious Part of the whole Tran|&s;action; having di&s;arm'd the Guard, the next thing was to Storm the Tolbooth, immediately they get Ladders to the Windows, and breaking in, they &s;eize upon 250 Halberts which are the Towns Arms; with the&s;e upon their Shoulders in Rank and File they Rov'd about the Streets, and made their Rendezvous at the Old Ca&s;tle where their Guard was kept; Here they gave out, That, in the Afternoon, they would come down and Plunder the Mer|chants Hou&s;es, nay, and threatened their Lives too, which put the whole City in an Un&s;peakable Con&s;ternation.</P>
<P>Nor were they wanting in &s;ome part of their Threatened Execu|tion, for about three in the Afternoon they Detach'd a Party of about twenty Men Arm'd, &s;ome with Mu&s;quets, &s;ome with Halberts, the&s;e, with a Drum before them, came to the Cro&s;s, and from thence took their March down the High Streets, breaking open the Doors and Hou&s;es of who ever they plea&s;ed, pretending to &s;earch for Arms, but Stole and Plundered whatever came in their way, and thus they continued till ten a Clock at Night.</P>
<P>They got not above thirty Mu&s;quets, with &s;ome Pi&s;tols and Swords, but the Terror of the Inhabitants is not to be expre&s;s'd, who were oblig'd to bear this Violence without Complaint; This &s;mall Party was follow'd by a va&s;t Throng of Boys and Idle Fellows like them&s;elves, which encrea&s;ed the Fright of the Citizens.&mdash;</P>
<P>Having thus Ranged the City at Plea&s;ure till about ten a Clock at Night, they March'd away with the Spoil of their Ma&s;ters up to their Main Guard, from thence they Beat their Tatoo round the Town like a Gari&s;on; and indeed they were no le&s;s, for they had the City in their full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and every Bodies Life and Goods at their Mercy.</P>
<P>Their Rudene&s;s in this pretended Search for Arms is not to be de|&s;cribed, and had they met with any Oppo&s;ition, no doubt it would have been wor&s;e; They came into the Rooms where Per&s;ons that lay Sick were ju&s;t Dying, and put all things into inexpre&s;&s;ible Con|fu&s;ion;
<PB N="69" REF="280">
They came into Chambers, where Women were Lying in, and Barbarou&s;ly made them Ri&s;e, pretending to Search under their Beds for Arms: In &s;hort, except that there was no Blood &s;hed, they acted the exact part of an Enraged Ungoverned Multitude.</P>
<P>But, to return to their Army of Fourty Five, which was all this while on its March; And were advanc'd as far as <HI>Kil&s;yth,</HI> on their Way to <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>The Government, who had an exact Account of all the&s;e things, and who had tryed all the Gentle Methods of Proclamations, Acts of Parliament, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Finding to what Height Things were brought, and that nothing but Force could Remedy Them, prepar'd to be before-hand with the&s;e Forward Gentlemen; And having an Account both of their March and Number, The Lord Commi&s;&s;io|ner ordered a Detachment of Dragoons, joyn'd with &s;ome Hor&s;e Granadeers of the Guard, under the Command of Colonel <HI>Campbell,</HI> Uncle to the Duke of <HI>Argyll,</HI> to March with all Expedition for <HI>Gla&s;gow.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Finlay,</HI> in the mean time being at <HI>Kil&s;yth,</HI> has Notice of the March of the&s;e Dragoons, within a few Hours after his Arrival there; And hearing no News of the great Parties of 5 and 6000, which he had per&s;waded his Men would meet him there; And being alarm'd at the News of the Dragoons he &s;ends back&mdash;<HI>Campbell,</HI> another of the Ring-Leaders of his Rabble, to bring up the &s;econd Body which was to be ready to fol|low, and which were Reported to be 400, <HI>but they Thank'd him, and Stay'd at Home;</HI> And with the re&s;t he March'd to <HI>Hamilton,</HI> where he Arriv'd on <HI>Sunday</HI> about Noon, the third day after his March from <HI>Gla&s;gow.</HI></P>
<P>Here he Quartered his Army that Night, and finding, as before, none of the Friends that were to A&s;&s;emble from all Parts, nor no News of them, he be&s;tow'd a Volley of Cur&s;es upon them, and Marches directly back to <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> where he Arriv'd, to the no &s;mall Mortification of his Fellows, on <HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> the next day but one after the Plunderings I have related before; They had Halted at <HI>Rugland,</HI> a Burgh about two Miles from <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> where, as I &s;up|po&s;e, they called a Council of War among them&s;elves; but, be|ing all Voters, they Agreed upon nothing, but to March Home, which accordingly they did; and, in Order of Battel, enter'd the City, and March'd directly up to their Main Guard afore&s;aid: Here they made, <HI>&s;ays my Author,</HI> their Rendezvous, having not thought fit to keep the Field any longer.</P>
<P>And now they began to think a little, for I cannot allow my &s;elf to &s;ay they had done it before; Their Danger began now to &s;how it &s;elf, and to &s;tare in their Faces a little; They began to con&s;ider what they had been doing with others, and what was now like to be do|ing with them; They had no more Protection from the Act about Mu&s;tering, and the proclamation began to work with them; And now they did the only Rational Act of their whole Management, and which indeed &s;aved all their Lives.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="281">
On <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> Morning, having maturely weighed their Affairs, they re&s;olved to &s;eparate, and lay down their Arms, which accordingly they did very quietly and calmly, and carryed their Arms, not to the Magi&s;trates, where they had them, but to the Deacons of their Trades, who they knew were their Friends.</P>
<P>How it came to pa&s;s, That Providence, whom they had &s;o far provoked, In&s;pir'd them with this Prudence, &s;o &s;ea&s;onably for their own Safety, none, but that Infinite Goodne&s;s, that puni&s;hes le&s;s than Crimes de&s;erve, can &s;ay; 'Tis mo&s;t certain, they had no par|ticular Intelligence of the March of the Queens Troops, for the City it &s;elf knew nothing of them more than in general; But it was not full two Hours after they had &s;eparated, delivered their Arms, and all was quiet, but the Dragoons enter'd the Town, not a Magi|&s;trate, nor an Inhabitant knew of them, till they &s;aw them upon the Street, to their no &s;mall Satisfaction.</P>
<P>The whole Party was about 220 Men; They had march'd with great Secrecy all Night, and &s;uffered no Body to pa&s;s by them, to carry Notice before of their Coming&mdash;; When they came near the City, Colonel <HI>Campbell</HI> detach'd an Advanc'd Party of twenty five Dragoons, under the Command of Lieutenant <HI>Pollock</HI> who knew the Town, and knew where <HI>Finlay</HI> liv'd, the whole Body following at a &s;mall Di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant entering the Town, &s;topt, and Allighted ju&s;t at <HI>Finlay</HI>'s Door, and ru&s;hing immediately in with two or three Dra|goons, they find <HI>Finlay</HI> and one <HI>Montgomery,</HI> another of the Knot, but Famous for nothing that ever I heard of, but his being taken with him, &s;itting by the Fire; They &s;eiz'd them immediately, and by this time the whole Body was entered the City, March'd down to the Cro&s;s, and Drew up there on the Street, where they &s;ate &s;till upon their Hor&s;es, it Raining very hard all the time, which was about three Hours.</P>
<P>The Mob of the City were in no &s;mall Con&s;ternation, as may well be &s;uppo&s;ed, at this Appearance; And &s;everal, who&s;e Guilt gave them Ground to think of the Gallows, made the be&s;t of their way out of the Town; There was no Appearance of any Re&s;cue, and the Dragoons Commanded the People off of the Street, and to keep their Hou&s;es&mdash;; Two Fellows had the Boldne&s;s to Beat a Drum in two &s;everal parts of the City, but the Gentlemen they call'd for, had more Wit than to come, and the Drummers, with very much Difficulty, narrowly e&s;cap'd being killed.</P>
<P>The Dragoons having &s;ecur'd their Pri&s;oners, and mounted them on Hor&s;e-back, with their Legs tyed under the Hor&s;es Bellys; Never &s;o much as Allighted or Baited their Hor&s;es, but Marched away the &s;ame Afternoon to <HI>Kil&s;yth.</HI></P>
<P>As they were going away, they had &s;ome Stones Thrown at them from the Tops of Hou&s;es, and &s;ome that were &s;tragling be|hind had like to have been Knock'd off of their Hor&s;es, but Six or Seven Dragoons coming back, they were &s;etched off without Hurt.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="282">
No &s;ooner were they gone out of the Town, but the Drums beat again in all the Streets, and the Rable got together with all the Rage and Venome imaginable, and coming to the Magi&s;trates, they told them in &s;o many words, that they &s;hould &s;end &s;ome of their Number to <HI>Edinburgh</HI> immediately, for that if they had not their two Men delivered to them, they would pull their Hou&s;es down about their Ears. Some have blam'd the Magi&s;trates for &s;ending to <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> But if &s;uch would con&s;ider Circum&s;tances, how the Dragoons were gone, they had an Enrag'd Mob to deal with, and no &s;trength to Defend them&s;elves, it can not but be thought the Gentlemen were in the right to comply with the Juncture of the Time, and Gratifie rather than Exa&s;perate them, when they were ab&s;o|lutely in their Power.</P>
<P>The Magi&s;trates, however, according to the Command of their Ma&s;ters the Mobb, (for &s;uch at this time they were,) &s;ent away two of the Baillies of the Town, and &s;ome of the Deacons of Trades went with them, but they &s;oon came back again as wi&s;e as they went, having received a &s;evere Check from the Council by the Mouth of the Lord Chancellor; and it was once within a little of their being committed to Pri&s;on with the other.</P>
<P>Thus ended, this petty War, being the only Violence we meet with in the whole Tran&s;action. I had not been &s;o large in the Re|lation of &s;o triffling an Affair, but that it &s;erves to clear up &s;everal other Ca&s;es to the World, which otherwi&s;e there are &s;everal Mi&s;takes about.</P>
<P N="1">1. And principally indeed for the &s;ake of the City of <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> a City which in all Ages &s;ince the Reformation, and in the very Re|formation it &s;elf, has been particularly Famous for Hone&s;ty, Zeal, and Bravery in a con&s;tant Oppo&s;ition to the Enemies either of the Religion or Liberties of their Countrey&mdash;, a City Eminent for the True and Sincere Profe&s;&s;ion of the Reformed Religion, and forward upon all Occa&s;ions to &s;pend their Blood and Trea&s;ure in Defence of it: And as nothing can be more Untrue than to &s;ugge&s;t, this Tu|mult was the Act and Deed of the City of <HI>Gla&s;gow:</HI> So to clear her of that Scandal, I thought my &s;elf oblig'd to do her Ju&s;tice, by &s;et|ting the Ca&s;e in its true Light; nothing clears up the Innocence of a Per&s;on or Party like bare matter of Fact, and therefore I have Im|partially related this Story ju&s;t as I receiv'd it upon the Spot from &s;e|veral of the principal Inhabitants of the City, who&s;e Integrity in the Relation I have no Rea&s;on to que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Nothing is more certain, than that the Tumult at <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> had its Ri&s;e and Beginning among the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party: In all the Rabble and Riots, they were &s;ecured as they pa&s;t the Streets, they were Carre&s;t by the Mob, they Huzza'd them to the Work, their Hou&s;es were never &s;earch'd for Arms, nor the lea&s;t In&s;ult offered to their Per&s;ons; The very Leaders of the Rabble were of their Party, and indeed their Friends mixt them&s;elves with the Rabbles on all Occa&s;ions, to prompt them to In&s;ult the Citizens.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="283">
The Rabblers them&s;elves on the other hand were a &s;ort of Peo|ple ignorantly Inflam'd by this Party, and unhappily &s;et on Fire by an Accident which had its beginning rather in an Ignorance of the Plot of that Party, than De&s;ign to &s;erve them in it.</P>
<P>But for the City of <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> it is clear, not a Citizen of any Note, not a Magi&s;trate, not a Merchant, not any thing that can be cal|led Denominating to a Place, but what Abhorr'd it, and as far as they dur&s;t Oppo&s;ed it; and I think 'tis hard they &s;hould fir&s;t fall under the Misfortune, and then under the Scandal of it too; And for that Rea&s;on I have been thus particular in the Story.</P>
<P>Again, here may be &s;een a &s;mall Scetch of the Petitioners and Addre&s;&s;ers again&s;t the Union, &amp; of their Original, who they are that were moved, and who moved them; not a Papi&s;t, not a Jacobite, not a Prelati&s;t in <HI>Scotland</HI> but what Declar'd them&s;elves again&s;t the Union; and tho&s;e hone&s;t Men that unhappily Approve them in that, may &s;ee what Ble&s;&s;ed Company they were yoked with, which is a Hint I cannot avoid leaving upon Record for their In&s;truction.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have told you that the <HI>Sunday</HI> after being the 15<HI>th</HI> of <HI>De|cember,</HI> the Dragoons returned to <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> and in &s;tead of return|ing the two Pri&s;oners they had taken, carried away three more, and had Directions for others, but it &s;eems they were fled.</P>
<P>They went to <HI>Hamilton</HI> al&s;o, and &s;eiz'd two Gentlemen &amp; a Lady, who belong'd to the Dutche&s;s&mdash;, and who, they &s;aid, <HI>Finlay</HI> Accu&s;ed, but both the&s;e, and all the re&s;t, were, after the Union was fini&s;hed, Di&s;charged without Puni&s;hment; the Merciful Go|vernment of Her Maje&s;ty rather delighting to Pity, than to Puni&s;h the Follies of the poor deluded people; &s;hewing them the Difference between the legally E&s;tabli&s;h'd Power, which they blindly Oppo&s;ed, and the pa&s;t Implacable and Mercile&s;s Tyrrany, which they as blindly E&s;pou&s;ed.</P>
<P>And thus happily Ended the Tumult at <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> which put the Hone&s;t People of both Nations in no &s;mall Apprehen&s;ions; and which, if the Party had obtain'd their De&s;ign, in getting the poor People into Arms in other Places, might have been Fatal enough.</P>
<P>Mean time, the Queen was not Unconcerned at the&s;e Di&s;orders, and Troops were &s;ent from <HI>England</HI> to the Borders, to be ready to A&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>Scots</HI> Forces, and to &s;upport the Government, if there had been Occa&s;ion; having Orders given them to Quarter in the mo&s;t Northerly Towns of <HI>England,</HI> and to take their farther Orders from the Lord High Commi&s;&s;ioner of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as there &s;hould be Oc|ca&s;ion. But the Succe&s;s of Things beginning to change a little after the&s;e Hurreys, there was no Occa&s;ion for them.</P>
<P>The Parliament was now entered upon the clo&s;s Debate of the Articles, and the fir&s;t and chief Points being pa&s;t in the Hou&s;e, it was plain to every body, that the Hou&s;e was re&s;olved to go thorow the Work; And it is no wonder if the la&s;t Struggles of all the Parties Oppo&s;ing it, were now &s;een.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="284" MS="y">
All the Attempts to rai&s;e Tumults, and to Rabble the Parliament out of it, had proved Abortive; And it was found impo&s;&s;ible to bring the Common People into any thing Extraordinary, while few or none of the Gentry thought fit to appear with them; All that had hitherto been done, was, by an underhand kind of Management of the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party, <HI>as they called them,</HI> to &s;ee, if po&s;&s;ible, they could pu&s;h the Presbyterians, or the meer Rabble of the Common People upon making &s;ome Di&s;turbance, that &s;o they might pull down their Enemies, by the Hands of one another, and &s;ee their Work done for them; This was apparent from the manner of Proceedings, which was by dropping Papers, and &s;ending about private Me&s;|&s;ages from no particular Per&s;on, but as from their Brethren in this or that Shire, Inviting, Directing, and Encouraging the People to Meet and A&s;&s;emble, to furni&s;h them&s;elves with Arms and Amu|nition, and Nameing Place and Day where to Meet and A&s;&s;emble, in order to March to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and to Rai&s;e the Parliament, and prevent the Ruine, <HI>&s;uch they then called the &V;nion,</HI> of their Coun|trey, and their being given up to the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>They took all the&s;e Cour&s;es to Rai&s;e and Excite the People, but &s;till they found it Ineffectual as to Meetings and Rendezvouzes, ex|cept as you have &s;een; however, the Parliament took &s;ome notice of it, the Lord Commi&s;&s;ioner laid it before them on the 29 <HI>No|vember,</HI> and they immediately cau&s;ed a Proclamation to be publi&s;h|ed, to prevent Tumultary and Irregular Convocations of the Liedges; This was the &s;ame which was Read in <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> at the Time of the Tumult, as afore&s;aid, when the People Stoned the Me&s;&s;enger that Read it, off from the Head of the Stairs of the Town Hall or Tol|booth.</P>
<P>It had been con&s;idered, that there was a Clau&s;e in the Act of Se|curity, which Impowered the People to Meet, or Conveen in Arms, under pretence of Exerci&s;ing the Fencible Men&mdash;; The Clau&s;e was as follows.<Q>And for a further Security to this Realm, Her Majesty with Advice and Con&s;ent afore&s;aid, Statutes and Enacts, That the whole Prote&s;tant Heretors, and all the Burghs within the &s;ame, &s;hall forthwith provide them&s;elves with Fire Arms for all the fencible Men who are Prote&s;tants within their re&s;pective Bounds, and tho&s;e of the Bore proportioned to a Bullet of 14 Drop weight running; And the &s;aid Heretors and Burghs are hereby Im|powered and Ordained to Di&s;cipline and Exerci&s;e their fencible Men, once in the Month at lea&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>Now the fir&s;t Rumours of Country Tumults had been pretended to be founded upon this Clau&s;e, and that under pretence of this Exerci&s;ing and Di&s;ciplining the Fencible Men, any number of Men might appear together in Arms without Breach of the Law&mdash;. This was indeed a wide Gap in the publick Peace, at which there was Room for a whole Army to enter. For any of the Gentry, No|bility,

<P>It was time now to &s;top this Breach, and therefore an Act was pa&s;t in the Hou&s;e, to Repeal the above-&s;aid Clau&s;e, &s;o far forth as it extended to the Meeting, Mu&s;tering, and Conveening together of the People during the &s;itting of the Parliament; which Act being a very plain Evidence to the Truth of what I am upon, I have Added here, as being not long enough to interrupt the Thread of this Di&s;cour&s;e.<Q>OUR SOVEREIGN LADY Con&s;idering, That, by the 3<HI>d</HI> Act of the 2<HI>d</HI> Se&s;&s;ion of this Parliament, Intituled, <HI>Act for Se|curity of the Kingdom,</HI> It is Statute and Enacted, That the whole Prote&s;tant Heretors, and all the Burghs within the &s;ame, &s;hall furthwith provide them&s;elves with Fire Arms for all the Fencible Men, who are Prote&s;tants, within their re&s;pective Bounds, and the &s;aid Heretors and Burghs are thereby Impowered and Or|dained to Di&s;cipline and Exerci&s;e their Fencible Men once in the Month at lea&s;t; And al&s;o Con&s;idering, That the Di&s;orderly and Seditious Meetings and Tumults in &s;ome Places in the Coun|trey, do make it nece&s;&s;ary, at this Occa&s;ion, to Su&s;pend the Effect of the fore&s;aid Clau&s;e, during this Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament allen|narly. <HI>Therefore</HI> Her Maje&s;ty, with Advice and Con&s;ent of the E&s;tates of Parliament, doth hereby Su&s;pend the Effect of the fore&s;aid Clau&s;e, and that during this Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament al|lennarly. <HI>And further,</HI> Her Maje&s;ty, with Advice and Con&s;ent fore&s;aid, Di&s;charges and &s;trictly Prohibites the Subjects of this Kingdom, to Meet and A&s;&s;emble together in Arms, after the Publication hereof, upon any Pretence what&s;oever, during the Space fore&s;aid, without Her Maje&s;ties &s;pecial Command, or expre&s;s Licence had or obtained thereto.

<P>This was a mo&s;t Effectual Step to Check the Riots and Tumults of the People, for after this, no Man of any Con&s;ideration dur&s;t &s;how him&s;elf; And finding the Government Re&s;olved to puni&s;h whoever &s;hould make any Attempt of that Nature, they began to give over the Thought of taking Arms.</P>
<P>Thus the Affair without Doors &s;eem'd to attend the Debates of the Parliament, and all we meet from Abroad, amounted to no

more than Addre&s;&s;es without Number from the Towns and Coun|treys and &s;ome from the Presbyteries, again&s;t the Union in the Terms of the Articles, with Di&s;putes about Amendments to the &s;e|veral Articles, as they came before them: The particular Ca&s;es of which will come of Cour&s;e, in the Ob&s;ervations on the Minutes of Parliament.&mdash;</P>
<P>Mean time it may be noted, the Parliament enter'd upon the De|bate of the Articles, Stating the Duties, Settling the Equivalent that was to be paid to <HI>Scotland,</HI> in Con&s;ideration of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Debts, Proportioning the Exci&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This Affair of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Debts has been &s;uch an Occa&s;ion of Clamour in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that I cannot but think it very nece&s;&s;ary to give a State of it in &s;hort, as it lay before the Parliament.</P>
<P>The Treaters in <HI>England,</HI> as has been noted in the Ob&s;ervations on the Minutes of the Treaty in <HI>London,</HI> had been convinced of the Nece&s;&s;ity of having the Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;es of <HI>Scotland,</HI> when they came to an Union, run in the &s;ame Channel with the Exci&s;es and Cu&s;toms in <HI>England;</HI> and this, by Con&s;equence, engaged them in the &s;ame Appropriations and Incumberances, that the &s;ame Du|ties in <HI>England</HI> were lyable to.</P>
<P>This created an Objection, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>Scotland</HI> was under no Incumberance of Debt, at lea&s;t none that tho&s;e Duties were appro|priated to; and therefore, to bring her into Taxes <HI>of any &s;ort,</HI> other than &s;uch as were to bear the Burthen of the War, was not con&s;i&s;tent with the Equalities of Burthens, which were allowed to be the only Foundation of an Union.</P>
<P>The Equity of this was not to be with&s;tood, and therefore the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners readily agreed, there was no Rea&s;on the Re|venue of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould be applyed to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Debt without Conditions&mdash;; But as the Circum&s;tances of the Nations requir|ed an Equality of Taxes, and tho&s;e Taxes in <HI>Scotland</HI> mu&s;t run in the Channel of the Taxes of the &s;ame Kinds in <HI>England,</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> mu&s;t pay to <HI>Scotland</HI> an Equivalent in Money: This was &s;ettled by the Treaty, as in the Minutes appears at large.</P>
<P>Now the Equivalent being determin'd, the Parliament was for a long while imployed in debating what Taxes, what Cu&s;toms, and what Exci&s;es &s;hould be paid by <HI>Scotland</HI>&mdash;; It is needle&s;s to enter up|on the particular Rea&s;onings on the &s;everal Heads as they were de|bated in the Parliament, &s;ince the Minutes of the Parliament will particularly di&s;cu&s;s tho&s;e Points, but it may be needful to note a little the Rea&s;ons of all tho&s;e Di&s;putes.</P>
<P>I have often noted, That there was a Party who were bu&s;y, not &s;o much in Arguing for Regulating, as De&s;troying the Articles; that Argued again&s;t the Union in general, not again&s;t the Articles in particular; The&s;e having in vain &s;truggled again&s;t the main Ar|ticles of the Treaty, &s;uch as Union in general, Succe&s;&s;ion, Com|munication of Trade, and the like, began now to Labour at the par|ticular Heads; and fir&s;t they would have it, that <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould not pay any of the Cu&s;toms or Exci&s;es in U&s;e in <HI>England,</HI> but when
<PB N="76" REF="287">
convinc'd of the Inju&s;tice of tho&s;e Pretences, they could no longer object again&s;t an Equality of Taxes; Then they began new De|bates upon the Circum&s;tances of the &s;aid Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;es, and pu&s;h'd at all &s;orts of Exemptions, Inequalities of Payments, Re|&s;trictions and Latitudes they could imagine, if po&s;&s;ible to bring on &s;ome Amendments upon the Articles, which they knew would per|plex the Union in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament, &s;uch were the Liberty of Exporting Wooll, the Exemption from the Duties on Salt for ever, the Reducing their Ale to the Exci&s;e of Small Beer in <HI>England,</HI> and the like; And this makes it appear, that I have not wronged them, in &s;aying, that their De&s;ign was at the Union in gene|ral.</P>
<P>It would be too much to enter upon the Di&s;cour&s;e here of the &s;everal Objections again&s;t the Equivalent, the Taxes, the Exci&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and innumerable Cavils at the &s;everal Duties on Export or Im|port&mdash;. The&s;e things occupied the whole Town, and all the People, as their &s;everal Fancies and Informers led them, &s;pent the time in Canva&s;&s;ing and Di&s;puting the Articles of Commerce, Im|po&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> what could be paid, and what not.</P>
<P>Nor is it to be wondred, that the&s;e Debates were Warm, for as the pro&s;pect of Tumult began to abate, the People took the more liberty in Speech, and the Government being very backward to Puni&s;h the Exorbitances of the Tongue, at a Time when they were Inviting all the People to Unite, all the Gall and ill Humour of the Party vented it &s;elf at the Mouth. This filled the Countrey with innumerable Railry and Reproach, all Companies were divided; nay, even Families, Relations, and the neare&s;t in Affection, divided upon this Subject.</P>
<P>The Scruples of Religion al&s;o revived now, and a great many finding the Treaty was like to go on, began to &s;et up their Foun|dations for Oppo&s;ition, and revive the Scruples of the Union in|terfeiring with the National Covenant, the Danger of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> from the Suffrages of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bi&s;hops, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>All the&s;e things helped to rai&s;e Heats among the People, and &s;ome went up to a &s;trange height of Jealou&s;ie and Di&s;content, and what <HI>they could do,</HI> they did; As for Tumults and Rebellions, that time began to be over with them, but Parties and Feuds encrea&s;ed every Day: And &s;o they went on till the Parliament went thro' the whole Treaty, and how they behaved then, will follow to be &s;po|ken to in its Cour&s;e.</P>

The Party again&s;t the Union finding the Articles, as they were concluded at <HI>London,</HI> were concealed, or at lea&s;t not made publick, gave out in <HI>Scotland,</HI> That the <HI>Scots</HI> Commi&s;&s;io|ners having had it in their Power to obtain mo&s;t Advantage|ous Conditions from <HI>England,</HI> but having been brought ba&s;ely to &s;ubmit to the Arbitrary De&s;igns of &s;ome Leading Men im|ployed in the Treaty in <HI>England,</HI> they had been very &s;uper|ficial in their Demands, and therefore dur&s;t not publi&s;h their Proceedings, till the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> met, and then the whole Treaty would be rejected, which would be agreeable to others of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of both Nations: This groundle&s;s Opinion being diffu&s;ed, and believed by many of their Party of be&s;t Sen&s;e, made them ea&s;ie and unactive, till too late they perceived the Queen, Her Mini&s;ters, and all Per&s;ons concerned in Adju&s;ting that Treaty, to be in earne&s;t, and then they turn'd the &s;ame Notion to another U&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> To Calumniate and Reproach the Commi&s;&s;ioners.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION III.</HEAD>
<P>Great Oppo&s;ition was made in Parliament this Day a|gain&s;t Reading the Articles&mdash;, and &s;everal Arguments brought by the Gentlemen on that &s;ide for Delays&mdash;, a|mong which this was one, and this the fir&s;t time it was &s;tart|ed in the Hou&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> The Con&s;ulting Principals or Con&s;ti|tuents, and &s;ome Gentlemen went &s;o far, as to acknowlege the Power of a Member of Parliament was Limited by their Con&s;tituents; and that the Parliament could not lawfully De|bate, much le&s;s Determine an Affair of &s;uch a Nature as this, <HI>viz.</HI> Of De&s;troying the Con&s;titution without, as afore|&s;aid, Con&s;ulting and Obtaining the Con&s;ent of their Con|&s;tituents.</P>
<P>It was Replyed that,
<LIST>
<ITEM> 1. This was not a de&s;troying the Con&s;titution.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Parliament was particularly Called by Her Maje&s;ty for this End; and the Work expre&s;&s;ed in the Proclamation for their Election, and that therefore they were particularly Elected by their Con&s;tituents for this Work, and thereby Im|powered to Debate and Conclude it, without farther Powers.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Others Argued the Po&s;itive, and Affirmed the Parlia|ment had full Power to Act on this Matter, tho' there had been no &s;uch Expre&s;sion in the Proclamation.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Debate was long, and warm enough, and began to Inform us what was to be expected; but on the whole it was carried to Read the Articles, by a great Majority: The other being taken as an Attempt to gain Time.</P>
<P>A Propo&s;al was made this Day for a General Fa&s;t&mdash;, which occa&s;ioned &s;ome Debates, but was Adjourned.</P>
<P>And here it was very publickly ob&s;erved, from what Hands the Motion of a Fa&s;t came: Some maliciou&s;ly enough, tho' merrily, Noted, That the Motion of a Fa&s;t came fir&s;t from tho&s;e, who were very rarely ob&s;erv'd either to Fa&s;t or Pray, and that now began to Talk &s;o Religiou&s;ly, that it was taken for a meer Banter.</P>
<P>On the other Hand it was ob&s;erved, That the mo&s;t Sober and Religious Members, both of the Nobility and Gentry, oppo&s;ed this Motion in the Hou&s;e; But the Rea&s;on was evident.</P>
<P>The great Project ju&s;t then carrying on in the Kingdom, was to Amu&s;e the People, Po&s;&s;e&s;s them with Fears of &s;ome Strange Thing then Tran&s;acting, and of Impending Dangers dreadful to the Kingdom, and which they had no Remedy
<PB N="6" REF="293">
to prevent, but as in great Di&s;tre&s;s, to fly to their Prayers as Mariners in a Storm&mdash;: This they thought would, of Cour&s;e, be made the more Terrible by the Mini&s;ters in gene|ral, exciting the People to extraordinary Humiliations, which, <HI>whether ill de&s;ign'd or no,</HI> might be ill enough Impro|ved, and the People thereby made the more Unea&s;y.</P>
<P>Perhaps al&s;o they might hope for &s;ome Indi&s;cretion and undue Warmth in the Pulpit, e&s;pecially from &s;ome Men, which they were willing to think they could influence to &s;o much Weakne&s;s, but in this al&s;o they were di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame Rea&s;ons, tho&s;e Gentlemen who were of the mo&s;t Religious Conver&s;ation, and known to be well Affected to the Church, and to any thing that had but an A&s;pect of &s;incere Piety, were neverthele&s;s again&s;t this Fa&s;t, as Un&s;ea|&s;onable and Dangerous, and as a thing they fore&s;aw was de|&s;ign'd particularly to make the People Unea&s;y with the&s;e Pro&s;|pects; The Debate was urged warmly enough on both &s;ides, but at la&s;t was Adjourn'd; and &s;o the de&s;igned Fa&s;t was put off for the pre&s;ent, tho' it was afterwards introduced piece meal, and all the u&s;e made of it that could be to rai&s;e the Spirits of the People, if po&s;&s;ible, to the Di&s;orders aimed at, as we &s;hall &s;ee in the Sequel of this Hi&s;tory.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION IV.</HEAD>
<P>Here, the Gentlemen who appeared again&s;t the Union, finding they could not carry the Point, as Debated the la&s;t Day, Moved for a Delay of but Eight Days; and &s;everal Ar|guments were offered, to obtain &s;o &s;hort a Delay.</P>
<P>But in this, they lo&s;t &s;everal of tho&s;e who Voted with them before, and who &s;eeing the Vote of Con&s;ulting Con&s;ti|tuents Rejected, could not be convinced of the Advantage of eight days Delay; and this made it &s;eem more particularly a De&s;ign only to Delay.</P>
<P>Whereupon the Que&s;tion being put, it was carried by a great Majority; And this was the fir&s;t Tryal of the Strength of the Parties, and the fir&s;t encouraging Proof that the Union would go on: The Majority on this Vote was &s;ixty four, but the Names having not yet been Ordered to be made pub|lick, it was not known who were on one &s;ide or the other.</P>
<P>Before this Vote was put, it was al&s;o Debated, whether this Reading of the Articles, &s;hould be in order to proceed upon them to a Vote. And here again the Gentlemen had their Turn of Advantage, nor was there any great Oppo&s;iti|on; for tho&s;e who were for the Union; were yet willing to have it fully Debated, and all things for its better Explana|tion under&s;tood; and were content to have it as thorowly Ex|amined as they plea&s;ed, and therefore gave their Votes freely for a general Reading.</P>
<P>The other Gentlemen who were only pu&s;hing at Delays, and &s;triving to gain Time, thought they gain'd a great Point in this, and therefore with all their Intere&s;t they pu&s;h'd at a general Reading only, which was pre&s;ently agreed to, <HI>viz. That the Articles &s;hould be Read and</HI> Di&s;cour&s;ed <HI>of in this Parliament; but that none of them &s;hould be Voted, till all was Read over and Con&s;idered.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the above Debate, and concluding only to Read and Di&s;cour&s;e, the fir&s;t Article of the Treaty was Read publickly, but the Reading of the Commi&s;&s;ions and Minutes, taking up a great deal of Time, there was not much Di&s;cour&s;e in the Hou&s;e at that time, for the great Affair now in Agitation, was to &s;tir up the People without Doors, and bring them ei|ther by Clamour, Tumult, or Tumultuous Addre&s;&s;es, to de|clare a general Di&s;like both of the Union in General, and of the Articles in Particular; And at this time they began to Threaten from without Doors.</P>
<P>The Streets and Doors were exceedingly Throug'd this Day in expectation of the Event, the People expecting igno|rantly to hear whether the fir&s;t Article was Voted and Ap|proved, or Rejected; and when &s;ome Body came out and
<PB N="8" REF="295">
&s;aid Unwarrily the fir&s;t Article was not Voted, it run thro' the Town, that it was Rejected; And the Mob, who ap|peared now to be Managed by &s;ome Gentlemen, began to Shout, and People apprehended the Union had been Voted again&s;t in the General, but they were Di&s;covered too &s;oon by this, and it was pre&s;ently under&s;tood, that the Article was only Di&s;cour&s;ed of and the Di&s;cour&s;e Adjourned too.</P>
<P>The next day the Minutes being Printed, the Minds of the People were a little Cool'd, when they &s;aw the Hou&s;e went on &s;o deliberately, and that nothing was to be Voted, while all the Articles were Read over and Con&s;idered.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION V.</HEAD>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ion of the General A&s;&s;embly having &s;ate from the 9<HI>th</HI> In&s;tant, had been in &s;everal warm Debates about the Matter, in what manner they &s;hould behave them&s;elves in this Juncture: Some Hot Gentlemen had given them Di|&s;turbance
<PB N="9" REF="296">
enough about the Matter of the Fa&s;t, and with|out Doors it was Reported, they would Prote&s;t again&s;t the Union.</P>
<P>But the Generality being Governed by more Temper and Moderation than &s;ome People hoped for, all things went on there peaceably, <HI>I mean,</HI> as to their publick Re&s;olutions; And the Addre&s;s to the Parliament was conceived in as Mo|derate Terms as could be expected, and is at large Printed in the <HI>Appendix, N. B*.</HI></P>
<P>The An&s;wer to it was al&s;o &s;atisfactory enough&mdash;, in that they declared, they would go upon the Addre&s;s, before any thing was concluded; It was however warmly pre&s;&s;ed in the Parliament, That the &s;aid Addre&s;s &s;hould be immediately entered upon, before they went on upon the Union&mdash;; But this, as another Advantage de&s;ign'd for Delay, was check'd, and the An&s;wer in the Minute agreed upon.</P>
<P>Great Pains was taken al&s;o at this time, to make the Commi&s;&s;ion of the A&s;&s;embly unea&s;y at this An&s;wer, as not &s;atisfactory; Jealou&s;ies were fomented, and Sugge&s;tions whi&s;|pered about from one to another, as if the Parliament de|&s;ign'd to po&s;tpone the Affairs of the Church to the la&s;t, and &s;o perhaps drop them at once: This obtained but too much, and being put forward by warm and unea&s;y People, grew higher and higher, and help'd on the Inflammations which unhappily follow'd.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject of the Fir&s;t Article, tho' not Named in the Minutes was al&s;o re-a&s;&s;umed in the Di&s;cour&s;es of this Day, and &s;everal Arguments again&s;t the Union it &s;elf, as an Incorporating Uni|on, were brought, in order to prove it Impracticable, Incon|venient, and Di&s;advantageous to <HI>Scotland;</HI> And therefore, that they ought rather to proceed upon the Con&s;ideration of the general, before they went on to the particular Articles.</P>
<P>This however was only Di&s;cour&s;ed, and the Reading the &s;everal Articles having been already Approven, they pro|ceeded to the Reading the re&s;t of the Articles, as in the Minutes.</P>
<P>In the Reading the Second Article, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Act of Parliament for Limiting the Succe&s;&s;ion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> was Di&s;cour&s;ed on, and much was &s;aid about the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Limitations; and &s;ome People that had been of another Mind formerly, &s;eem|ed to di&s;cover an Inclination of coming into the Succe&s;&s;ion with Limitations, and began to enter into the Matter of Li|mitations; But this being remote to the Work was dropt for the pre&s;ent, and we &s;hall meet with it again in its place.</P>
<P>The Third Article al&s;o relating to Uniting the Parlia|ments of both Kingdoms was Read, and &s;ome took the Li|berty to Je&s;t with it as a Chytherical Calculation, and that they had no Power to Alter the Repre&s;entative of the Nati|on, that <HI>Scotland</HI> could not Con&s;ent to be Govern'd by any
<PB N="10" REF="297">
other Repre&s;entative, than they were now; And that, if the Parliaments were to be made one, <HI>Scotlands</HI> whole Par|liament ought to be joyned to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament, and that <HI>Scotland</HI> ought no more to Abridge her Repre&s;entative than <HI>England,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>But the Unrea&s;onablene&s;s of this was urged from the Di&s;|parity, in Extent of the Country, Number of People, and Proportion of Taxes, of which hereafter.</P>
<P>The Five En&s;uing Articles being all upon Privileges of Trade, Exci&s;es and Cu&s;toms, the Di&s;cour&s;es were very gene|ral on both &s;ides, and tho&s;e things &s;eem'd referr'd to more Debates afterwards: All that was &s;aid of tho&s;e things now, &s;eem'd rather to tend, if po&s;&s;ible, to per&s;wade the People in general, that the Union was Impracticable, that <HI>Scotland</HI> could not come into the Taxes, and that the Equalities talk'd of, would ruine their Trade and &s;tarve their Poor.</P>
<P>Without Doors, &s;trange U&s;e was made of the&s;e Articles of Taxes, and the People were made to believe, their Salt, their Malt, their Beer, their Fi&s;h, would all be Loaded with In&s;upportable Taxes, and their whole Trade &s;hould be ruin'd, their Hou&s;es plunder'd for Taxes, and their People &s;tarv'd; And no Man that &s;hall &s;ee, with what Frightful Apprehen&s;i|ons the poor People were po&s;&s;e&s;t, will any more wonder, they were &s;o ea&s;ily brought into Tumults and Di&s;orders&mdash;.</P>
<P>Nota, <HI>This Day there were &s;trong Rumours about the Town, of the Mob coming up to the Parliament, to demand, That the Crown and Scepter of</HI> Scotland <HI>&s;hould not be given up, and carryed away to</HI> England.</P>
<P>This was the Effect of &s;ome Popular Speeches let fall by tho&s;e Gentlemen who oppo&s;ed the Treaty, and indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread about the Town a Report, That the Sovereignty of <HI>Scotland</HI> was to be Subjected to the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> And the poor|er Sort that under&s;tood le&s;s, had the &s;ame Thing in other Words, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Crown of <HI>Scotland</HI> was Betray'd; That it was to be carryed to <HI>England,</HI> and never to be &s;een here more. Of which &s;ee at large in its place.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e, however, took no Notice of this yet, as being a Rumour only, tho' the Members were not without Apprehen|&s;ions, That it might ri&s;e to a greater Height; And that they might come to be In&s;ulted, even in the Hou&s;e, as indeed was afterwards very probable.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION VI.</HEAD>
<P>The Calculations of the Ninth Article were a little Exa|mined, but appeared &s;o ju&s;t, and the Equalities &s;o well Stat|ed, That there was no Room to object; For the Ce&s;s being but the &s;ame upon <HI>Scotland</HI> as before, there could nothing be &s;aid, why they &s;hould not go into Mea&s;ures for carrying on any joynt Expence, which, in Time to come, the United Body &s;hould &s;ee Cau&s;e to put the Whole to.</P>
<P>And this was the fir&s;t Vi&s;ible Explication of the Doctrine of Equalities, and a Proof that Equalities con&s;i&s;ted in Pro|portions, <HI>of which more hereafter:</HI> Some People, to &s;erve the De&s;igns now on Foot, had made the Ignorant People be|lieve, That, by Equalities, would be under&s;tood a Numerical Equality, and that <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould pay in every Thing ju&s;t as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> did&mdash;; This did therefore a little &s;erve to open the Eyes of Con&s;idering People and let them &s;ee, that the Treaty had been founded upon &s;omething of Ju&s;tice; For, by this time, it had been Repre&s;ented as a Strange many-Headed Mon&s;ter, that had nothing but Mouths and Teeth, and Unfathomable Gulphs to Devour and De&s;troy the People.</P>
<P>The Five Articles between the Ninth and Fifteenth re|quir'd little Debate, &s;ince they con&s;i&s;ted only of Negatives, and Provi&s;ion made for <HI>Scotland</HI> again&s;t payment of any of the Duties then Levyed in <HI>England</HI> by the Stamp-Office Tax, Gla&s;s-Window Tax, and the &s;everal Duties on Coals and Malt, together with Exemption from any of the Proportions of Ce&s;s as above for the fir&s;t Year&mdash;; Only, from the&s;e Ar|ticles,
<PB N="12" REF="299">
&s;ome Gentlemen took Occa&s;ion to remind them of the Nece&s;&s;ary Care taken by the Treaters, to Exempt <HI>Scotland</HI> in all Ca&s;es from &s;uch Burdens, as they found them unable to bear, and which ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity did not oblige them to &s;ubject her to, and in &s;uch Ca&s;es to receive Equivalents, for what ever they were oblig'd to come into by the Nece&s;&s;ity of Trade.</P>
<P>But the Ferment was now grown high, and the&s;e Di&s;|cour&s;es had little Signification, the People being Unhappily Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;'&s;t beyond the power of Convictions.</P>
<P>The 14<HI>th</HI> Article occa&s;ioned long Di&s;cour&s;es, both within Doors and without, and a great many ill natur'd Things were &s;aid on both &s;ides, the Matter of an Equivalent had not yet been Examined much into, and the Rea&s;on, Nature, and Nece&s;&s;ity of it, had gone but a very little way into the Un|der&s;tandings, even of the Gentlemen them&s;elves. The Trea|ters al&s;o here met with &s;ome Indecencies, and the Reflections made on them, had &s;uch an Effect in publick, as had they not met with &s;ome Check, might have been per&s;onally Mi&s;chie|vous to them, as to the partacted Abroad; &s;ee Fol. 28 <HI>of the next precedent part.</HI> Within Doors they met with &s;ome very unkind Reproaches, as if they had not made due Provi&s;ions for their Countries Nece&s;&s;ities, had con&s;ented to Intolerable and Un|ju&s;t Burthens, and had Mock'd them with the Notion of an Equivalent, which did not le&s;&s;en the Burthens upon the Na|tion their payment being to be Levied where it could not be paid; and then repaid again where it was not Levied.</P>
<P>To make good the&s;e Charges, they pretended to make Calculations upon the Proportions of the &s;aid Equivalent and &s;ome indeed brought in their own rough Draughts of Di&s;|proportions, whereupon it was Moved, That the Hou&s;e &s;hould enter upon more exact Calculations, and Examine the matters of Fact.

<HEAD>OBSERVATION VII.</HEAD>
<P>The Debate of the Equivalent grew higher this day than before, and the Fifteenth Article was the Subject of a great Deal of ill natur'd Di&s;cour&s;e in the Hou&s;e; From without there was a very Terrible Clamour, and the Humours of the People being brought as it were to a pitch, but too much appeared to Corre&s;pond with &s;ome thing vi&s;ible within Doors. Several very unkind Reflections were made upon the Treaters, not upon their Judgments only, but upon their Integrity, as if they had been le&s;s ju&s;t to their Countrey, than con&s;i&s;ted with the Tru&s;t Repo&s;ed in them.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen on the other hand defended them|&s;elves as calmly as they could, and endeavour'd to clear up the Objections made to the Ju&s;tice of their Proceedings, offered to Examine the Calculations, and An&s;wer any thing that could be objected: But the Hou&s;e grew too much out of Temper to talk much of it then, and the Prudence of the High Commi&s;&s;ioner; in order to Calm Things; and keep them as Ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible, prevented its running Higher at that time&mdash;. The former Propo&s;al was Rea&s;&s;umed, <HI>viz.</HI> To refer it to the Examination of a Committee; And the Hou&s;e was Moved to Name the Committee.</P>
<P>Upon this Motion; it was again Moved; That none of the Treaters &s;hould be capable of being Named to the &s;aid Committee&mdash;. This, tho' it look'd, as if the Committee were to be a Jury upon the Treaters, to Examine their Con|duct, yet the Gentlemen unanimou&s;ly agreed to; And the Choo&s;ing a Committee was Approven, who went thorow the Calculations, and gave in &s;uch exact Accounts of Things, as abundantly cleared up the Reputation of the Commi&s;&s;ioners.</P>
<P>It was al&s;o Moved, that to A&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;aid Committee, Two very able Accomptants; or Arithmeticians &s;hould be found, to Examine the Calculations; one of which was Dr. <HI>James Gregory;</HI> Profe&s;&s;or of the Mathematicks in the College of <HI>Edin|burgh;</HI> The other was Dr. <HI>Thomas Bowar,</HI> Profe&s;&s;or of the Ma|thematicks in the College of <HI>Aberdeen.</HI></P>
<P>The Sixteenth and Seventeenth Articles about the Coin, and about Weights and Mea&s;ures, occa&s;ioned little or no De|bate.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="301">
The Eighteenth Article had indeed &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e upon it, as what &s;hould, or &s;hould not be Alterable by the Parlia|ment of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and &s;ome Gentlemen were for E&s;tabli&s;h|ing all the pre&s;ent Laws, without Alteration; A thing no Nation in the World practi&s;es, &s;ince Circum&s;tances of Nations Altering, may always make it Nece&s;&s;ary to Alter, Amend, Re|new, or Repeal the Laws and U&s;ages of a Nation:</P>
<P>And the Di&s;tinction in the Article it &s;elf, was &s;uch, as few could object, viz. <HI>That no Alteration &s;hould be made in the Laws, re&s;pecting private Rights, except for the evident &V;tility of the Subject within</HI> Scotland. This therefore, &s;eemed to Ex|plain the true Meaning of the Article in that Point; yet the other part of the Article about the Laws of Publick Right, Policy, and Civil Government, being made the &s;ame thro' out the whole United Kingdom; this occa&s;ioned long Di&s;|cour&s;es, and held the Hou&s;e &s;o late, that they thought fit to Adjourn it till the next <HI>Sederunt.</HI></P>

<P>This was the Fatal Day of the Tumult in the Streets, and the Hou&s;e was no le&s;s warm within, proportionably &s;peak|ing, than the Gentlemen were without, all which had its Share in Agitating the publick Confu&s;ions: I am far from &s;aying, That the Arguments u&s;ed within Doors, occa&s;ioned the Rabbles, but the Improvement a Party without Doors made of them, and the manner in which things now &s;aid in the Parliament were Repre&s;ented without, concurr'd to encrea&s;e the Ferment of the Nation.</P>
<P>The Di&s;cour&s;es on the Eighteenth Article were now car|ryed on with great Warmth; Many long Speeches were made this Day, too long to be &s;et down here, but tending all to this, That <HI>Scotland</HI> ought not to &s;ubject them&s;elves to Duties of any &s;ort, before it &s;hould be known what &s;uch Duties were; That no Laws of Cu&s;toms or Exci&s;es &s;hould take place, and that it could not be proper to allow the &s;everal Laws of Exci&s;e or Cu&s;toms in <HI>England,</HI> till it was fir&s;t calculated and agreed, what Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;es <HI>Scot|land</HI> was to pay&mdash;; Then the Di&s;cour&s;es on the paying Equalities of Taxes being re-a&s;&s;umed, &s;ome took Occa&s;ion to make Reflections again on the Treaters, for &s;ubjecting their Country to Taxes, which fir&s;t they alledged they did not under&s;tand, and &s;econdly they were not able to pay.</P>
<P>The Reproaches ca&s;t upon the Treaters, the ill Behaviour of &s;ome Members, and the Indecencies &s;hown in the&s;e Ca&s;es, were &s;o Univer&s;al, that even Her Maje&s;ties High Commi&s;&s;io|ner did not e&s;cape, but was very ill u&s;ed, which neverthe|le&s;s His Grace with a great deal of Temper &s;uffered, without any Di&s;order, preferring the publick Peace to all his private Re&s;entments; And by this Prudence pre|vented tho&s;e who de&s;ired to have things Exa&s;perated, and hoped to &s;ee the Re&s;entment of the Government run up fir&s;t, that they might have &s;omething to pretend for the Irregula|rities which follow'd.</P>
<P>It may al&s;o be ob&s;erved here, That the Printing the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Laws, Books of Rates, Exci&s;es and Cu&s;toms, which it was very certain would not be under&s;tood here, and from which a thou&s;and fal&s;e Sugge&s;tions would every day be rai&s;ed, whence few People could An&s;wer, was a De&s;ign calculated for a great many Ends, which were to be An&s;wer'd in the future Proceedings, and of which we &s;hall hear more hereafter.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="303">
A Committee was Nominated al&s;o for this Work, and thou&s;ands of Difficulties were continually rai&s;ed in the Mouths of the People, to Expo&s;e the Treaty, and Exa&s;perate the People, &s;uch as, That the Tax upon Salt was Intolerable, and that it would De&s;troy the Fi&s;hery, and the Poor were Repre&s;ented to Sub&s;i&s;t &s;o much upon Salt, as if it had been one of the greate&s;t parts of their Food.</P>
<P>The Exci&s;e on Beer, Ale, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> was Repre&s;ented as In&s;up|portable, and great Pains were taken to prove, that the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> paid 4 <HI>&s;h.</HI> 9 <HI>d. per</HI> Barrel upon their Table Beer; and that the <HI>Scots</HI> Small Ale mu&s;t pay equal Exci&s;e to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Strong Beer; And this was publickly Printed in the Streets, on purpo&s;e to Enrage the People.</P>
<P>It was in vain to offer Calculations on the&s;e Heads&mdash;; And tho' it was, by the Author of this Work, proved by di|rect and po&s;itive Demon&s;tration, that the Exci&s;e of their Ale could, in Proportion, pay no more than it did now, even by the Calculation of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Exci&s;es; And that the Expence of Salt, in any Hou&s;e in the Kingdom, could not ri&s;e to above 20 <HI>d. per</HI> Head <HI>per Annum,</HI> yet it was in vain; all Calculations of this &s;ort were ridiculed and expo&s;ed as fal&s;e and partial, and the Author maltreated in Print for his E&s;&s;ays on tho&s;e things, as an Enemy to the Country, and in order to expo&s;e him to the Fury of the Rabble, which had particu|larly mark'd him out for De&s;truction, in the general Commo|tions which follow'd.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e Calculations appeared afterward to be right, as in their place will more particularly appear.</P>
<P>However, the whole Debate of this Day could not bring them over the Eighteenth Article, the farther Di&s;cour&s;e of which was, as <HI>per</HI> the Minute, adjourned, and what inter|rupted it further, you will &s;ee in the next Days Work.</P>
<P>The Salt was an Argument People &s;tuck very clo&s;s to, and &s;trove to make it Popular; For the Poor &s;eemed to be con|cerned in it, and tho&s;e that e&s;pou&s;ed it, whatever their Ends were in e&s;pou&s;ing it, they always made the Relief and Ea&s;e of the Poor the main Argument: This was Taking and En|gaging with the Common People, and as much U&s;e was made of it, as if the Salt had been a principal part of their Food, and the Duty &s;o great, that the Poor mu&s;t have been &s;tarved, if they had payed it&mdash;; The Debate, however, had this Effect, that it brought the Parliament to enter into the Con&s;ideration of Amendments and Exemptions, which they particularly &s;ettled in this Affair, and which the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> ea&s;ily came into, as will appear in its place.</P>

<P>The Lord high Chancellor Repre&s;ented to the Parliament, That he was directed by the Lords of Her Maje&s;ties Privy Council, to Acquaint the Parliament, That upon occa&s;ion of a Rabble and Tu|mult that happened in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> upon <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> Night la&s;t, by which &s;everal Members of Parliament were Threatned and In&s;ulted; The Privy Council had, for the Security of the Members of Parlia|ment and Peace of the Town, brought in a part of the Foot Guards to the Town of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and had i&s;&s;ued forth a Proclamation again&s;t &s;uch Tumultary Meetings, in the Terms of &s;everal Acts of Parliament.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION IX.</HEAD>
<P>This whole day was a meer Interruption to the Reading of the Articles, and the Hou&s;e was employed wholly on the Affair of the Rabbles.</P>
<P>The Lord Commi&s;&s;ioner having found the encrea&s;e of the Mob come to &s;uch a Degree, as that the whole City was in Danger, and indeed the whole Con&s;titution would otherwi&s;e have been Expo&s;ed; His Grace ordered the Guards to enter the City about One of the Clock in the Morning, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Magi&s;trates, by which means the Tumult was Appea&s;ed, and the Rabble di&s;per&s;'d; &s;ome of the Rioters had been &s;eized and &s;ecured, and the Souldiers kept Po&s;t in the City all that Night, the en&s;uing Day and the Night, and part of this Day, without being Relieved, tho the Weather was exceeding Cold.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="306">
The Council had the Day before, Ratified what the Lord Commi&s;&s;ioner had done, and it was not doubted but the Par|liament would do the &s;ame; the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a proceeding, being, as was thought, enough to &s;atisfie any Body who was not for having the Civil Authority &s;ubjected to the In&s;olencies of the Rabble.</P>
<P>But People were &s;trangely &s;urprized, when they &s;aw this &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed in the Parliament; and had it not been carryed by a Majority in the Hou&s;e, the Con&s;equences mu&s;t have terminated in a &s;econd Rabble, more Fatal and Furi|ous than the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The Marque&s;s of <HI>A&mdash;le</HI> was the fir&s;t Man who made Objection again&s;t it, and pleaded, That it was an Encroach|ment upon the Liberty of Parliament, and taking away their Freedom of Speech; That it was Awing the Hou&s;e with Souldiers, and bringing upon them Arbitrary Government; and &s;everal Speeches were made to this purpo&s;e, in which one Noble Per&s;on &s;aid, He could perceive the Difference al|ready in the Votes of the Hou&s;e, and that the Influence of the Souldiers had Altered the Matter.</P>
<P>The&s;e were hard Sayings indeed, and it was thought a hard Point, that People &s;hould call the being &s;ubjected to an Un|govern'd Rabble, Liberty of Parliament, and the Clamours of the Mob, Freedom of Speech; It was plain, if the Guards were not brought up, the Members of Parliament would be Aw'd, and the Treaters Ma&s;&s;acred by the Mob; and to place Guards to Suppre&s;s Tumults, and Re&s;train the Head-&s;trong Multitude, was very far from Awing the Parlia|ment; it being al&s;o apparent, that this Guard was intirely Subordinate to the Commands of the Parliament, and were placed to Maintain, not Infringe the Liberty of Speech they &s;poke of; That no Man could be Influenc'd by Men &s;et on|ly to keep the Peace, and di&s;per&s;e Rabbles, and in a Ca&s;e when it was apparent to all the World, the Nece&s;&s;ity was &s;uch, That, unle&s;s tho&s;e Rabbles were &s;uppre&s;s'd, the Par|liament could not &s;it at all, nor the Bu&s;ine&s;s they were A&s;&s;embled for be Debated.</P>
<P>The Oppo&s;ers, however, maintain'd the Di&s;pute a long time; but when they came to the Que&s;tion, it was appa|rent, a great many of their Friends, in other Ca&s;es yet, were &s;o convinc'd of the Nece&s;&s;ity of this, That they Voted again&s;t them, and &s;o the Actings of the Lord Com|mi&s;&s;ioner, and al&s;o of the Council, were Approved, and the Thanks of the Hou&s;e Ordered, as in the Vote.</P>
<P>The Prote&s;ters are Named in the Minute, as above; And this, I think, was the fir&s;t Prote&s;t made in Parliament, upon the Affair of the Union.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="307">
This Debate, of Cour&s;e, put off the further Con&s;ideration of the Eighteenth Article of the Union, which was the Work of the Day.</P>
<P>There was great Struggling in the Hou&s;e, on Pretence of the Infringing the Privileges of the City of <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> But the Magi&s;trates having declared them&s;elves &s;atisfied in the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Ca&s;e, and the Impo&s;&s;ibility of Keeping the Peace without this Method, that Debate was al&s;o couch'd in the Prote&s;t as above, and every Body acquie&s;c'd; The Guards continued in their Po&s;ts, and the re&s;pective Regi|ments Reliev'd one another with Beat of Drum, as is u&s;ual, but the Effect was only Keeping the Peace; No Violence was offered to the Parliament, neither were any Souldiers plac'd at the Door to Awe the Members, much le&s;s was any denyed Enterance, or any other Per&s;on Acce&s;s to them, as on other Occa&s;ions&mdash;; But the Parliament was perfectly Free, Open and Uninterrupted, the Souldiers were a Guard to them, but not a Guard again&s;t them, and it was not in the Power of any Per&s;on to &s;ay, he received the lea&s;t Affront from them: Indeed the Souldiers appeared wholly Uncon|cerned in any part of the Affair, they only Executed the Office of a Guard to pre&s;erve the Peace, and keep the Government from being In&s;ulted.</P>
<P>And in this peaceable Behaviour of the Souldiery, con&s;i&s;ted a great deal of the Succe&s;s of the Treaty, for this took away all pretence from a party of Men, who aim'd at, and &s;ought for &s;ome &s;uch Irregularity to complain of, in or|der to have Prote&s;ted again&s;t the Parliament, as under Re|&s;traint, and &s;o having a legal Objection again&s;t the Proceed|ings as not Acted in a Free Parliament.</P>
<P>This was a Di&s;appointment to a certain great Per&s;on, who propo&s;ed a Prote&s;t again&s;t this very Thing, as an Act of Vio|lence, and &s;o leaving the Hou&s;e as a Body, pretending they were under the power of the Army; But the Souldiers being &s;o Ordered, as to behave them&s;elves quietly, and only taking Po&s;t as a Guard to the City, to pre&s;erve the publick Peace; the Doors of Parliament being always free and Uninterrupted, tho&s;e People were Defeated; and even their own Friends, whom they propo&s;ed it to, refu&s;ed them, acknowledging they could not &s;u&s;tain the Allegation.</P>
<P>I think it is very nece&s;&s;ary to be particular in this ca&s;e, be|cau&s;e I know great Clamours were made, as well in <HI>England</HI> as in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as if the Souldiers, who upon this extraordinary Occa&s;ion, were brought into the City, and who did indeed keep Guard in the Parliament Clo&s;s, were an Awe and a Ter|ror to the Parliament, and that con&s;equently it was not a free Parliament.</P>

<P>Tho&s;e that oppo&s;ed it, would not directly Argue again&s;t Reading the Articles at all, &amp; &s;o at once Reject the Treaty; But they began to &s;tart a new Scruple, <HI>viz.</HI> Why &s;hould it be put upon the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to Determine fir&s;t upon the Treaty? Why &s;hould not <HI>England,</HI> where the Treaty had been Form|ed, and where their Parliament was now to Sit in a few Days; Why &s;hould not they fir&s;t Signify their Con&s;ent to the Treaty, and then the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> might Con&s;ider, whether they could joyn with them upon the Terms, YEA or NO?</P>
<P>This occa&s;ioned great Di&s;putes, and many Speeches were made, endeavouring to &s;hew the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of having this Matter fir&s;t Determin'd in <HI>England.</HI></P>

<P>That the Priority was a Di&s;pute of no Con&s;equence at all, and that they had all the Liberty in the World to Pa&s;s or not Pa&s;s, Approve or not Approve of the Treaty now, as they &s;hould have then; That, if there was any Difference, the Honour was done to <HI>Scotland,</HI> in putting the Treaty fir&s;t into their Hands, as the Principal Per&s;ons, who were &s;uppo&s;ed to have Objections to make, and that they might

<P>Notwith&s;tanding all this, they renewed the Debate, and brought it to a Motion in the Parliament, as appears by the Vote, in which they al&s;o added the former Sugge&s;tion of Con&s;ulting their Con&s;tituents; And &s;ome Members alledg|ed, they had expre&s;s Directions from their Principals, and the Countries they Repre&s;ented, Re&s;training, and po&s;itively Obliging them, not to Enter upon the Treaty.</P>
<P>This brought Things to a great Height, and &s;ome Mem|bers, <HI>as was &s;aid,</HI> began to Talk of Prote&s;ting, and Leaving the Parliament, but they had more Wi&s;dom than that came to&mdash;; They indeed very earne&s;tly pre&s;s'd this Motion, which was in &s;hort to Obtain a Delay, and that made them fly from one Argument to another.</P>
<P>Together with their Arguments, and to Second their Pro|po&s;al of Con&s;ulting Principals, they brought in Addre&s;&s;es from the &s;everal Places mentioned above, and vehemently urged, That it appeared by them, that it was the Sen&s;e of the People, that the whole Nation was again&s;t it, and that they ought not to Poceed without their A&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>Here it was Noted, That the Addre&s;s from <HI>Mid-Lothian</HI> was Signed by not above Twelve of the Gentlemen, or there|about, tho' there were above Two Hundred Gentlemen in that County; And that therefore it &s;eemed the Argument, of its being the Sen&s;e of the Nation, mu&s;t be very ill Grounded.</P>
<P>At length they dropt the Debate, and obtained the pre|vious Que&s;tion, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Parliament &s;hould immediately proceed to Reading the Articles.</P>
<P>But then a new Project was &s;et on Foot; and it was an odd thing to &s;ee, that after a long Debate whether the Articles &s;hould be Read <HI>at all</HI> or no, it occa&s;ioned another Que&s;tion, and no &s;mall Debate upon it, which End of them they &s;hould begin at.</P>
<P>When they had gotten over the Que&s;tion as before, for Reading, they fell out which Article they &s;hould Read fir&s;t; the Party which had at fir&s;t oppo&s;ed Reading them all, now &s;truggled to begin in the middle of the Treaty, the Rea|&s;on was, as they alledged, they were for Examining the Particulars before they Voted the General. The fir&s;t Article con|tain'd, That from and after the fir&s;t Day of <HI>May,</HI> the two Kingdoms &s;hould be United, <HI>&amp;c. This they would have de|layed;</HI> and then followed the Conditions which they would have be agreed fir&s;t of all.</P>
<P>Others alledged, that it would be needle&s;s to enter in|to the Particulars till it was agreed, whether they &s;hould be UNITED or No; and therefore it was nece&s;&s;ary to Examine the fir&s;t Article in its order, not only becau&s;e it was the fir&s;t, but becau&s;e it was mo&s;t rational to Determine, whether there
<PB N="25" REF="312">
&s;hould be an Union or no, before they de&s;cended to the Par|ticulars, becau&s;e, if all the Articles were agreed to, yet if it &s;hould be &s;o precarious as to &s;tate the Que&s;tion afterwards, whether there &s;hould be a Union or no, it might at once ren|der all their Labour Fruitle&s;s.</P>
<P>Upon this Debate, they re&s;olved, it was fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to get over the main Article, Whether there &s;hould be a Union or not, before they entred into the Merits of the Particulars, or Examined the Conditions; and they only Read the Ar|ticle to fini&s;h the Debate, and prevent any more Difficulty.</P>

<P>The fir&s;t Article of Union was again Read, and thereupon a Motion was offered in thir Terms, That it be agreed to, in the fir&s;t place, To proceed to take the fir&s;t Article of the Union to Con&s;ide|ration, with this Provi&s;ion, That if the other Articles of Union be not adju&s;ted by the Parliament, then the Agreeing to, and Appro|ving of the Fir&s;t, &s;hall be of no Effect; And that immediately after the &s;aid fir&s;t Article, the Parliament will proceed to an <HI>Act For &s;ecurity of the Doctrine, Di&s;cipline, Wor&s;hip and Government of the Church, as now by Law E&s;tabli&s;hed within this Kingdom:</HI> And after &s;ome Debate thereon, there was a &s;tate of a Vote offered, Approve of the Motion, <HI>Yea</HI> or <HI>No.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XIV.</HEAD>
<P>The fir&s;t Article was now Read, and all the Oppo&s;ition hitherto made, had been over. But two plau&s;ible Things re|main'd; one was, To Debate whether it &s;hould be &s;o &s;ettled that if all the Articles were not Concluded, none of them which were Con&s;idered, &s;hould be of any Force; this was &s;o plau&s;ible, no Body could with&s;tand it.</P>
<P>Then they Objected in the Name of the Church, on the Occa&s;ion brought before them formerly, <HI>viz.</HI> The Act of Se|curity. Unhappy was the Condition at this time of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> if what &s;eem'd to appear, had been her real Ca&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> To have her greate&s;t Enemies be her be&s;t Solicitors, as if &s;he had been &s;o de&s;perate, that even tho&s;e that formerly A&s;&s;i&s;t|ed to pull her down, were the only &s;eeming Advocates for her pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>Or el&s;e &s;urely Her Ca&s;e was very happy, on the other hand, that Her E&s;tabli&s;hment was &s;o vi&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary at this time, that even Her apparent Enemies were careful to &s;upport Her.</P>
<P>I &s;hall enter no further into the My&s;tery of it here, the Parlia|ment had Voted to con&s;ider the Addre&s;s of the Commi&s;&s;ion, before any thing was Concluded, and whether that word, <HI>Concluded,</HI> was to &s;ignifie before they Voted any Article, or before the whole Union was Concluded, was now Immateri|al; and tho' it was expre&s;ly &s;aid in the Vote of <HI>October</HI> 17, That it &s;hould be before the Union was Concluded, yet it was Moved now, and the Parliament was &s;o willing to do every thing for the Satisfaction of the Nation, that they Re&s;olved to go upon it immediately after the pa&s;&s;ing the fir&s;t Article.</P>
<P>The Party that &s;till Oppo&s;ed, were for going on the Affair of the Church, before any of the Articles were Concluded on, alledging, That if the Security of the Church could not be agreed on, the Union could not be entered upon; but it was returned to that, That ju&s;t on the contrary, it was nece&s;&s;ary fir&s;t to Vote the General, Whether there &s;hould be a Union or no in the Terms of the Treaty, which General was included in the fir&s;t Article, and it was ea&s;ie to be &s;een, that if that Ar|ticle was Voted again&s;t, the Union was Rejected; and if the Union was Rejected, there was then no need for Di&s;cour&s;ing on the Act of Security for the Church.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="314">
This was too &s;trong a way of Rea&s;oning to be Re&s;i&s;ted, and therefore when it came to the Que&s;tion, it pa&s;t, as <HI>per</HI> the Minute.<Q>That it be agreed to, in the fir&s;t place, To proceed to take the fir&s;t Article of &V;nion to Con&s;ideration, with this Provi&s;ion, That if the other Articles of &V;nion be not ad|ju&s;ted by the Parliament, then the Agreeing to, and Appro|ving of the Fir&s;t, &s;hall be of no Effect; And that imme|diately after the &s;aid fir&s;t Article, the Parliament will pro|ceed to an Act for Security of the Doctrine, Di&s;cipline, Wor|&s;hip and Government of the Church, as now by Law E&s;ta|bli&s;hed within this Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>And now the fir&s;t Article came upon the Stage, and the fir&s;t Bru&s;h it met with was, That it was again&s;t the Claim of Right, as <HI>per</HI> the Minute.</P>
<P>This was a Surprizing Blow indeed, and made the Hou&s;e immediately Call for the Claim of Right, but that which was Remarkable upon Reading the Claim of Right was, it became nece&s;&s;ary to Read the Letter of the Convention at that time &s;ent to King <HI>William,</HI> in which, the E&s;tates then met, humbly de&s;ired His Maje&s;ty, to &s;et on Foot an Union in the very Sen&s;e and Meaning of this Incorporation of the Kingdoms, as the only Happine&s;s the Kingdom de&s;ired.<Q>We are mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of Your Maje&s;ties Kindne&s;s, and Fatherly Care to both Your Kingdoms, in promoving their &V;nion, which we hope hath been Re&s;erved to be Accompli&s;h|ed by You; That as both Kingdoms are &V;nited in one Head and Soveraign, &s;o they may become one Body Politick, one Nation, to be Repre&s;ented in one Parliament. And to te|&s;tifie our Readine&s;s to Comply with Your Maje&s;ty in that Mat|ter; We have Nominated Commi&s;&s;ioners to Treat the Terms of an Entire and Perpetual &V;nion betwixt the Two King|doms, with Re&s;ervation to us of our Church Government, as it &s;hall be E&s;tabli&s;hed at the Time of the &V;nion. The&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners do wait Your Maje&s;ties Approbation and Call, That they may Meet and Treat with the Commi&s;&s;ioners to be Appointed for <HI>England,</HI> at what Time and Place Your Maje&s;ty &s;hall Appoint. And if any Difficulty &s;hall ari&s;e in the Treaty, We do, upon our Part, Refer the Determination thereof to Your Maje&s;ty. And we do A&s;&s;ure our &s;elves, from Your Maje&s;ties Prudence and Goodne&s;s, of a Happy Conclu|&s;ion to that Important Affair, &s;o as the &s;ame may be Agreed to, and Ratified by Your Maje&s;ty in Your fir&s;t Parliament.</Q></P>
<P>This indeed occa&s;ioned a long Debate and much Warmth on both &s;ides, which held the Hou&s;e very late; And after Reading all the Papers, the Incon&s;i&s;tency of the Union with the Claim of Right was thorowly Examin'd, where it could not but be very remarkable to ob&s;erve &s;ome Gentlemen giv|ing a Sanction to the Claim of Right, who never before ac|knowleg'd

it, owning it now as a Sacred Foundation, in or|der to oppo&s;e it to the Scheme of Union now drawn; which being of more Fatal Con&s;equence to their Real De&s;ign, as well as Party, they were brought to the Nece&s;&s;ity of Clo&s;ing with the fir&s;t to Confront the la&s;t; &s;o Playing one again&s;t another, Recognizing the Revolution as the le&s;&s;er Evil to Repul&s;e the Union, which they &s;aw plainly Aim'd at the Foundation, Struck at the Root, and mu&s;t for ever Foreclo&s;e <HI>Jacobiti&s;m</HI> and <HI>Prelacy,</HI> the two Columes which &s;upported their Cau&s;e&mdash;. The Rea&s;onings here in the Hou&s;e began with much Calmne&s;s; Immediately after Reading the Ar|ticle, Mr. <HI>Seton</HI> of <HI>Pitmedden</HI> took the Opportunity to &s;ay, That, having had the Honour to be one of the Commi&s;&s;io|ners for the Treaty, he thought it his Duty to give &s;ome Rea|&s;ons, which mov'd him to Approve that Article at <HI>London;</HI> That he was per&s;waded, there were &s;everal Members &s;o Pre|judiced again&s;t all the Articles, that he could not hope from them a Favourable Audience. And that what he had to &s;ay to the pre&s;ent Subject of Debate, had been thought upon, when he Signed the Treaty; therefore he would pre&s;ume to make U&s;e of his Papers, hoping, tho' his Rea&s;ons could not convince any Member, yet they might &s;erve to Vindicate his Conduct to Po&s;terity. Then he proceeded, and the Second of <HI>November</HI> 1706, made the following Speech.<Q><P><HI>My Lord Chancellor,</HI></P>
<P>THis Honourable Hou&s;e has heard the &s;everal <HI>Articles of the Treaty of &V;nion</HI> twice Read, has &s;pent a con&s;iderable time in Di&s;cour&s;ing to each of them, and after much Debate is come to Examine and Determine upon the Fir&s;t: Notwith&s;tand|ing all the Arguments offered again&s;t it, I cannot find the lea&s;t Mo|tive for Altering the Opinion I had at Signing this Article, having had the Honour to be one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners Appointed by Her Maje&s;ty for that End; but that I may give all Satisfaction to every Member, I &s;hall humbly offer in a plain manner my Thoughts in relation to it.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> This Article is the Foundation of the whole Treaty, and the Approving or Rejecting of it mu&s;t Determine Union or no Union betwixt both Kingdoms.</P>
<P>How far the Approving this Article conduces to our Happine&s;s, appears evidently, by con&s;idering the three different Ways propo|&s;ed for Retriving the Langui&s;hing Condition of this Nation; which are, That we continue under the &s;ame Sovereign with <HI>England,</HI> with Limitations on his Prerogative as King of <HI>Scot|land;</HI> That the two Kingdoms be Incorporated into one, or that they be entirely &s;eparated.</P>
<P>That the Union of Crowns with Limitations on the Succe&s;&s;or is not &s;ufficient to Rectifie the bad State of this Nation, appears from the&s;e Po&s;itions founded on Rea&s;on and Experience.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="316">
Two Kingdoms &s;ubject to one Sovereign, having different Inte|re&s;ts, the nearer the&s;e are one to another, the greater Jealou&s;ie and Emulation will be betwixt 'em.</P>
<P>Every Monarch, having two or more Kingdoms, will be obliged to prefer the Coun&s;el and Intere&s;t of the Stronger to that of the Weaker: And the greater Di&s;parity of Power and Riches there is betwixt the&s;e Kingdoms, the greater influence the more powerful Nation will have on the Sovereign. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e Po&s;iti|ons, I &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> is Ve&s;ted with the Power of making Peace and War, of Rewarding and Puni&s;hing Per&s;ons of all Ranks, of Levying Troops, and of the <HI>Negative</HI> it &s;elf.</P>
<P>I cou'd &s;how the Inconveniencies that mu&s;t attend &s;uch a State of Government, in Di&s;po&s;al of Places and Managing Publick Affairs; I cou'd likewi&s;e &s;how the Improbability of Attaining &s;uch Conditions, or keeping 'em if attained; but laying a&s;ide &s;uch Con&s;iderations, my humble Opinion is, That we cannot reap any Benefit from the&s;e Conditions of Government, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>England:</HI> And the People thereof will never be convinced to promote the Intere&s;t of <HI>Scotland,</HI> 'till both King|doms are Incorporated into One: So that I conceive &s;uch a State of Limitations to be no better for <HI>Scotland,</HI> than if it were intire|ly &s;eparated from <HI>England,</HI> in which State there's little Appearance of procuring any Remedy to our pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, which appears from the&s;e uncontraverted Po&s;itions.</P>
<P>The People and Government of <HI>Scotland</HI> mu&s;t be Richer or Poorer, as they have Plenty or Scarcity of Money, the common Mea&s;ure of Trade.</P>
<P>No Money or Things of Value can be purcha&s;ed in the Cour&s;e of Commerce: but where there's a Force to protect it.</P>
<P>This Nation is behind all other Nations of <HI>Europe</HI> for many years, with re&s;pect to the Effects of an extended Trade.</P>
<P>This Nation being Poor, and without Force to protect it's Commerce, cannot reap great Advantages by it, till it partake of the Trade and Protection of &s;ome powerful Neighbour Nation, that can Communicate both the&s;e.</P>
<P>To Illu&s;trate this la&s;t Po&s;ition, I &s;hall give a &s;hort View of the State of Commerce we mu&s;t needs be in, with re&s;pect to our Neighbour Nations, &s;uppo&s;ing an entire Separation from <HI>Eng|land.</HI></P>
<P>The ordinary Mean, whereby we can flouri&s;h in Wealth, is, That Ballance which ari&s;es from the Exchange of our Natural or Artificial Product with other Places: But we have no Valuable Branch of Export, which does not Interfere with the like Com|modity, in &s;ome more powerful Neighbour Nation, who's Inte|re&s;t it is to Suppre&s;s or Di&s;courage our Commodity, for Rai&s;ing the Value of its own; &s;o that there's no Demon&s;trable Security for the Vent and Encouragement of any Branch of our Export.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="317">
Can it be expected, That <HI>Holland</HI> will &s;uffer us to Improve our Fi&s;hery, which is to them a Nur&s;ery for Seamen, a Livelyhood to many Families, and an immen&s;e Trea&s;ure to the Publick?</P>
<P>If we Traffick with <HI>England;</HI> our Linnen-Cloth, Cattle, and Coals will be Di&s;couraged, at lea&s;t, after the &s;ame manner that we di&s;courage Export from thence. If we Traffick with <HI>Mu&s;covy, Sweden, Denmark, Poland, Germany, France, Spain, Portugal</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> the Sale of our Commodities will be of &s;mall Value in the&s;e Places; &s;eing the <HI>Dutch</HI> or <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> by their Increa&s;e of Trade, are capable to &s;erve them with mo&s;t of the like Goods, cheaper and better than we.</P>
<P>Let us look to any other Part of the World, for Vent to our Product, and we'll find other Nations have prevented us.</P>
<P>If we attempt the <HI>Ea&s;t-India-</HI>Trade, that is already Enhan&s;ed by the <HI>Dutch, Engli&s;h, French, Spaniards</HI> or <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> from whom we mu&s;t expect Oppo&s;ition, they them&s;elves Oppo&s;ing one another daily; and we of no Force to Debate the &s;ame, with the mo&s;t Incon&s;iderable of them.</P>
<P>The Trade of <HI>Africae</HI> is, for the mo&s;t part, of &s;mall Value; and every Province of <HI>America</HI> is claimed as Property, by &s;ome powerful <HI>European</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid, That <HI>Scotland</HI> may make Alliance with one of its Neighbour Nations for Protection; that Alliance mu&s;t be with <HI>Holland, England</HI> or <HI>France:</HI> Other Countries being &s;o Remote or Poor, that their Friend&s;hips can be of little U&s;e to us.</P>
<P>With <HI>Holland</HI> we can have no Advantageous Alliance, becau&s;e its chief Branch of Trade is the &s;ame with ours; with the <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> we can expect no profitable Friend&s;hip, for they being our near Neighbours, will be Jealous of our Increa&s;e in Power; and from <HI>France,</HI> few Advantages can be reap'd, till the old Offen&s;ive and Defen&s;ive <HI>League</HI> be revived betwixt <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> which wou'd give Umbrage to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and occa&s;ion a War betwixt them and us. And allowing the <HI>Scots,</HI> in &s;uch a Juncture, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>France,</HI> to Conquer <HI>England; Scotland,</HI> by that Conque&s;t, cou'd not hope to better its pre&s;ent State; for 'tis more than probable, the Conquerour wou'd make his Re&s;idence in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> as formerly the Northern People u&s;ed to do in their Southern Expeditions.</P>
<P>From the&s;e Con&s;iderations I conceive, That this Nation, by an entire Separation from <HI>England,</HI> cannot extend it's Trade, &s;o as to rai&s;e its Power in Proportion to other Trafficking Nations in <HI>Eu|rope;</HI> but that hereby we may be in Danger of returning to that <HI>Gothick</HI> Con&s;titution of Government, wherein our Forefathers were, which was frequently attended with Feuds, Murders, De|predations and Rebellions.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> I'm &s;orry, That, in place of Things, we Amu&s;e our &s;elves with Words; for my part, I comprehend no durable Uni|on betwixt <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> but that expre&s;&s;ed in this Ar|ticle
<PB N="31" REF="318">
by <HI>One Kingdom,</HI> that is to &s;ay, One People, One Civil Go|vernment and One Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the Words, <HI>Federal &V;nion,</HI> are become very Fa&s;hion|able, and may be hand&s;omely fitted to delude unthinking People; But if any Member of this Hou&s;e will give him&s;elf the Trouble to examine what Conditions or Articles are under&s;tood by the&s;e words, and reduce them into any kind of Federal Compacts, whereby di&s;tinct Nations have been United: I'll pre&s;ume to &s;ay, The&s;e will be found Impracticable, or of very little U&s;e to us.</P>
<P>But to put that Matter in a clear Light, the&s;e <HI>Queries</HI> ought to be duly Examined, Whether a Federal Union be Practicable be|twixt two Nations accu&s;tomed to a Monarchical Government? Whe|ther there can be any &s;ure Guaranty projected for the Ob&s;ervance of the Articles of a Federal Compact, &s;tipulated betwixt two Nations; whereof the one is much Superior to the other in Riches, Numbers of People, and an extended Commerce? Whether the Ad|vantages of a Federal Union do Ballance its Di&s;advantages? Whe|ther the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> will accept a Federal Union, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be for the true Intere&s;t of both Nations? Whether any Federal Compact betwixt <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> is &s;ufficient to &s;ecure the Peace of this I&s;land, or Fortify it again&s;t the Intrigues and Inva&s;ions of its Foreign Enemies? And whether <HI>England</HI> in Prudence, ought to Communicate its Trade and Protection to this Nation, till both Kingdoms are Incorporated in one?</P>
<P> To clear this la&s;t <HI>Querie,</HI> I &s;hall offer a Remark from Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Of two Independent and di&s;tinct Kingdoms United by a Federal Compact under one Sovereign, the Weaker to pre&s;erve its Intere&s;t, has &s;ome times &s;eparated from the Stronger, unle&s;s prevented by open Force, or &s;ecret Influence on its Government.</P>
<P><HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal</HI> were &s;ubject to the &s;ame Sovereign, <HI>Philip</HI> II. And notwith&s;tanding the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> got mo&s;t Advantagious Conditi|ons from <HI>Spain,</HI> they no &s;ooner found a favourable Opportunity in the Reign of <HI>Philip</HI> IV. than they revolted from their Allegiance, and Elected the Duke of <HI>Braganza</HI> for their King.</P>
<P><HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Denmark</HI> were United by a Federal Compact under one Monarch, but the <HI>Swedes</HI> judging a Separation more for their Intere&s;t, broke off, and cho&s;e <HI>Gu&s;tavus</HI> the 1. for their King.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> I &s;hould now con&s;ider an Incorporating Union, as it is expre&s;&s;ed in this Article by <HI>One Kingdom;</HI> but that I may not take up the time of the Hou&s;e, I &s;hall only give one Hi&s;torical Re|mark with Relation to it.</P>
<P>Two or more di&s;tinct Kingdoms or States, by incorporating in|to one Kingdom, have continued under the &s;ame Sovereign, en|joying equally the Protection of his Government, and every part of the Body Politick, tho never &s;o far remov'd from the Seat of Government, has Flouri&s;hed in Wealth in proportion to the Value of it's Natural Product, or the Indu&s;try of its Inhabitants. To prove this Remark there are many Examples.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="319">
<HI>Spain</HI> was formerly divided into &s;everal Kingdoms, ten where|of are Incorporated into the one Kingdom of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>France</HI> was formerly divided into 12 States, which are Incorpo|rated into the one Kingdom of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><HI>England</HI> was formerly divided into &s;even Kingdoms, which are Incorporated into the one Kingdom of <HI>England; Scotland</HI> it &s;elf was formerly divided into two Kingdoms, which at pre&s;ent are Incorporated into the one Kingdom of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>I cou'd give &s;ome Account of the particular Advantages we'll obtain by an Incorporating Union with <HI>England,</HI> but there will be occa&s;ions to Di&s;cour&s;e of the&s;e, as the other Articles fall under the Con&s;ideration of this Parliament. In general, I may a&s;&s;ert, That by this Union, we'll have Acce&s;s to all the Advantages in Commerce, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> enjoy; we'll be capable, by a good Go|vernment, to improve our National Product, for the benefit of the whole I&s;land; and we'll have our Liberty, Property and Religion, &s;ecured under the Protection of one Sovereign, and one Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>Now, <HI>My Lord,</HI> If Limitations on the Succe&s;&s;or can be of little or no U&s;e to us; if an entire Separation from <HI>England</HI> brings no Advantage to this Nation: and if all Federal Compacts, as we are &s;tated, have in&s;uperable Difficulties, which in &s;ome mea&s;ure I have cleared, there is but one of two left to our Choi&s;e, <HI>to wit,</HI> That both Kingdoms be United into one, or that we continue un|der the &s;ame Sovereign with <HI>England</HI> as we have done the&s;e 100 years pa&s;t. This la&s;t I conceive to be a very ill State, for by it (if Experience be convincing) we cannot expect any of the Advantages of an Incorporating Union; but on the contrair, Our Sovereignty and Independency will be eclip&s;ed, the number of our Nobility will Encrea&s;e, Our Commons will be Oppre&s;&s;ed, Our Parliaments will be influenced by <HI>England,</HI> the Execution of our Laws will be neglected; Our Peace will be interrupted by Factions for Places and Pen&s;ions; Luxury together with Poverty (tho' &s;trange) will invade us; Numbers of <HI>Scots</HI> will withdraw them&s;elves to Foreign Countries; and all the other Effects of Bad Government mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily attend us.</P>
<P>Let us therefore, <HI>My Lord,</HI> after all the&s;e Con&s;iderations ap|prove this Article: and when the whole Treaty &s;hall be duly Exa|mined and Ratified, I'm hopeful, this Parliament will return their mo&s;t Dutiful Acknowledgments to Her Maje&s;ty, for Her Royal En|deavours in promoting a La&s;ting Union betwixt both Nations.</P></Q></P>
<P>Next &s;poke the Lord <HI>Beilhaven,</HI> but without an&s;wering what had been &s;aid by M. <HI>Seton,</HI> he made a long premeditate Speech, the Nature of which will be be&s;t under&s;tood by Reading it at length, which being &s;o much talk'd of in the World, I have al&s;o in&s;erted here, tho' I &s;hall not trouble the Reader with many more Speeches in this whole Hi&s;tory.<Q><PB N="33" REF="320">
<P><HI>My Lord Chancellor,</HI></P>
<P>WHEN I con&s;ider this Affair of an UNION betwixt the Two Nations, as it is expre&s;s'd in the &s;everal <HI>Articles</HI> thereof, and now the Subject of our Deliberation at this time; I find my Mind crowded with variety of very Melancholy Thoughts, and <HI>I</HI> think it my Duty to disburden my &s;elf of &s;ome of them, by lay|ing them before, and expo&s;ing them to the &s;erious Con&s;ideration of this Honourable Hou&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> think, <HI>I</HI> &s;ee <HI>a Free and Independent Kingdom</HI> delivering up That, which all the World hath been fighting for, &s;ince the days of <HI>Nimrod;</HI> yea, that for which mo&s;t of all the Empires, King|doms, States, Principalities and Dukedoms of <HI>Europe,</HI> are at this very time engaged in the mo&s;t Bloody and Cruel Wars that ever were, <HI>to wit,</HI> A Power to Manage their own Affairs by them&s;elves, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Coun&s;el of any other.</P>
<P>I think, I &s;ee <HI>a National Church,</HI> founded upon a Rock, &s;ecured by a <HI>Claim of Right,</HI> hedged and fenced about by the &s;tricte&s;t and pointede&s;t Legal Sanction that Sovereignty could contrive, volun|tarily de&s;cending into a Plain, upon an equal level with <HI>Jews, Papi&s;ts, Socinians, Arminians, Anabapti&s;ts,</HI> and other Sectaries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I think I &s;ee <HI>the Noble and Honourable Peerage of Scotland,</HI> who&s;e Valiant Predece&s;&s;ors led Armies again&s;t their Enemies upon their own proper Charges and Expen&s;es, now dive&s;ted of their Followers and Va&s;&s;alages, and put upon &s;uch an Equal Foot with their Va&s;|&s;als, that I think I &s;ee a petty <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Exci&s;e-man receive more Homage and Re&s;pect, than what was paid formerly to their <HI>quondam Maccallanmores.</HI></P>
<P>I think I &s;ee <HI>the pre&s;ent Peers of</HI> Scotland, who&s;e Noble Ance&s;tors conquered Provinces, over-run Countries, reduc'd and &s;ubjected Towns and fortify'd Places, exacted Tribute through the greate&s;t part of <HI>England,</HI> now walking in the Court of Reque&s;ts like &s;o many <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Attornies, laying a&s;ide their Walking Swords when in Com|pany with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Peers, le&s;t their Self-defence &s;hould be found Murder.</P>
<P>I think I &s;ee <HI>the Honourable Estate of Barons,</HI> the bold A&s;&s;erters of the Nation's Rights and Liberties in the wor&s;t of Times, now &s;etting a Watch upon their Lips and a Guard upon their Tongues, le&s;t they be found guilty of <HI>Scandalum Magnatum.</HI></P>
<P>I think I &s;ee <HI>the Royal State of Burrows</HI> walking their de&s;olate Streets, hanging down their Heads under Di&s;appointments; wormed out of all the Branches of their old Trade, uncertain what hand to turn to, nece&s;&s;itate to become Prentices to their unkind Neigh|bours; and yet after all finding their Trade &s;o fortified by Com|panies, and &s;ecured by Pre&s;criptions, that they de&s;pair of any &s;ucce&s;s therein.</P>
<P>I think I &s;ee <HI>our Learned Judges</HI> laying a&s;ide their Practiques and Deci&s;ions, &s;tudying the Common Law of <HI>England,</HI> gravelled with Certioraries, <HI>Ni&s;i prius's,</HI> Writs of Error, Verdicts indovar,
<PB N="34" REF="321">
<HI>Ejectione firmae,</HI> Injunctions, Demurrs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and frighted with Ap|peals and Avocations, becau&s;e of the new Regulations and Recti|fications they may meet with.</P>
<P>I think I &s;ee <HI>the Valiant and Gallant Soldiery</HI> either &s;ent to learn the Plantation Trade Abroad; or at Home Petitioning, for a &s;mall Sub&s;i&s;tance as the Reward of their honourable Exploits, while their old Cores are broken, the common Soldiers left to Beg, and the younge&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Corps kept &s;tanding.</P>
<P>I think I &s;ee <HI>the Hone&s;t Indu&s;trious Trade&s;man</HI> loaded with new Taxes, and Impo&s;itions, di&s;appointed of the Equivalents, drink|ing Water in place of Ale, eating his &s;at-le&s;s Pottage, Petitioning for Encouragement to his Manufacturies, and An&s;wered by counter Petitions:</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I think I &s;ee <HI>the Laborious Plew-man,</HI> with his Corns &s;poiling upon his Hands, for want of Sale, Cur&s;ing the day of his Birth, dreading the Expen&s;e of his Burial, and uncertain whether to Marry or do wor&s;e.</P>
<P>I think I &s;ee the Incureable Difficulties of the <HI>Landedmen,</HI> fet|tered under the Golden Chain of Equivalents, their pretty Daugh|ters Petitioning for want of Husbands, and their Sons for want of Imployments.</P>
<P>I think I &s;ee <HI>our Mariners,</HI> delivering up their Ships to their <HI>Dutch</HI> Partners; and what through Pre&s;&s;es and Nece&s;&s;ity, earning their Bread as Underlings in the Royal <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Navy.</P>
<P>But above all, <HI>My Lord,</HI> I think I &s;ee <HI>our Ancient Mother</HI> CALEDONIA, like <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> &s;itting in the mid&s;t of our Senate, Rufully looking round about her, Covering her &s;elf with her Royal Garment, attending the Fatal Blow, and breathing out her la&s;t with a <HI>Et tu quoque mi fili.</HI></P>
<P>Are not the&s;e, <HI>My Lord,</HI> very afflicting Thoughts? And yet they are but the lea&s;t part Sugge&s;ted to me by the&s;e Dishonourable Articles; &s;hould not the Con&s;ideration of the&s;e things vivifie the&s;e <HI>dry Bones</HI> of ours? Should not the Memory of our Noble Prede|ce&s;&s;ors <HI>Valour and Con&s;tancie,</HI> rou&s;e up our drouping Spirits? Are our Noble Predece&s;&s;ors Souls got &s;o far into the <HI>Engli&s;h Cabbage-Stock and Colliflowers,</HI> that we &s;hould &s;hew the lea&s;t Inclination that way? Are our Eyes &s;o Blinded? Are our Ears &s;o Deafned? Are our Hearts &s;o Hardned? Are our Tongues &s;o Faltered? Are our Hands &s;o Fettered, that in this our day, I &s;ay, <HI>My Lord, That in this our day, that we &s;hould not mind the things, that concern the very Being and Well-being of our Ancient Kingdom, before the day be hid from our Eyes.</HI></P>
<P>No, <HI>My Lord,</HI> GOD <HI>forbid, Man's Extremity is</HI> GOD's <HI>Oppor|tunity: He is a pre&s;ent Help in time of need; and a Deliverer, and that right early.</HI> Some unfore&s;een Providence will fall out, that may ca&s;t the Ballance; &s;ome <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> or other will &s;ay, <HI>Why do ye &s;trive together, &s;ince you are Brethren?</HI> None can De&s;troy <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;ave <HI>Scotland</HI>'s &s;elf; hold your Hands from the Pen, you are Se|cure. Some <HI>Judah</HI> or other will &s;ay, <HI>Let not our hands be upon</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="322">
<HI>the Lad, he is our Brother.</HI> There will be a <HI>JEHOVAH-JIREH</HI> and <HI>&s;ome Ram will be caught in the Thicket,</HI> when the bloody Knife is at our Mothers Throat; Let us up then, <HI>My Lord,</HI> and let our Noble Patriots behave them&s;elves like Men, and we know not how &s;oon a Ble&s;&s;ing may come.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> I wi&s;h from my Heart, that this my Vi&s;ion prove not as true, as my Rea&s;ons for it are probable; I de&s;ign not at this time to enter into the merits of any one particular Article, I intend this Di&s;cour&s;e, as an Introduction to what I may afterwards &s;ay upon the whole Debate, as it falls in before this Honourable Hou&s;e; and therefore, in the further Pro&s;ecution of what I have to &s;ay, I &s;hall in&s;i&s;t upon &s;ome few particulars, very nece&s;&s;ary to be under&s;tood, before we enter unto the Detail of &s;o Important a Matter.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore in the <HI>fir&s;t place,</HI> Endeavour to Encourage a free and full Deliberation, without Animo&s;ities and Heats; in the <HI>next place,</HI> I &s;hall Endeavour to make an Enquiry into the Nature and Source of the Unnatural and Dangerous Divi&s;ions that are now on Foot within this I&s;le, with &s;ome Motives &s;hewing, that it is our Intere&s;t to lay them a&s;ide, at this time. Then I &s;hall Enquire into the Rea&s;ons which have induced the two Nations to enter into a Treaty of Union at this time, with &s;ome Con&s;iderations and Meditations, with Relation to the Beha|viour of the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of the two Kingdoms, in the Management of this Great Concern. And la&s;tly, I &s;hall propo&s;e a Method, by which we &s;hall mo&s;t di&s;tinctly, and without Confu|fu&s;ion, go through the &s;everal Articles of this Treaty, without un|nece&s;&s;ary Repetitions or Lo&s;s of Time. And all this with all De|ference, and under the Correction of this Honourable Hou&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord Chancellor,</HI> The greate&s;t Honour that was done unto a <HI>Roman,</HI> was to allow him the Glory of a Triumph; the great|e&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;honourable Puni&s;hment was that of <HI>Paricide:</HI> He that was Guilty of <HI>Paricide,</HI> was beaten with Rods upon his naked Body, till the Blood gu&s;ht out of all the Veins of his Body; then he was &s;owed up in a Leathern Sack called a <HI>Culeus,</HI> with a Cock, a Viper, and an Ape, and thrown Headlong into the Sea.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord, Patricide</HI> is a greater Crime than <HI>Paricide,</HI> all the World over.</P>
<P>In a Triumph, <HI>My Lord,</HI> when the Conqueror was Riding in his Triumphal Chariot, Crowned with Lawrels, Adorned with Trophies, and Applauded with Huzza's, there was a <HI>Monitor</HI> ap|pointed to &s;tand behind him, to warn, Not to be High-minded, nor Puffed up with Overveening Thoughts of him&s;elf; and to his Chariot were tied a Whip and a Bell, to mind him, That, for all his Glory and Grandeur, he was Accountable to the People for his Admini&s;tration, and would be Puni&s;hed as other Men, if found Guilty.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t Honour among&s;t us, <HI>My Lord,</HI> is to Repre&s;ent the Sovereign's Sacred Per&s;on in Parliament; and, in one particular,
<PB N="36" REF="323">
it appears to be greater than that of a Triumph; becau&s;e the whole Legi&s;lative Power &s;eems to be wholly Intru&s;ted with him: If he give the Royal A&s;&s;ent to an Act of the E&s;tates, it becomes a Law Obligatory upon the Subject, tho' contrary or without any In&s;tructi|ons from the Sovereign: If he refu&s;e the Royal A&s;&s;ent to a Vote in Parliament, it cannot be a Law, tho' he has the Sovereign's particular and po&s;itive In&s;tructions for it.</P>
<P>His Grace the Duke of <HI>Queensberry,</HI> who now Repre&s;ents Her <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> in this Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, hath had the Honour of that Great Tru&s;t, as often, if not more than any <HI>Scots</HI> Man ever had; He hath been the Favorite of two Succe&s;&s;ive Sovereigns; and I cannot but commend his Con&s;tancy and Per&s;everance, that, notwith&s;tanding his former Difficulties and un&s;ucce&s;sful Attempts, and maugre &s;ome other Specialities not yet determined, that his Grace has yet had the Re&s;olution, to undertake the mo&s;t unpopu|lar Mea&s;ures la&s;t: If his Grace &s;ucceed in this Affair of an Union, and that it prove for the Happine&s;s and Welfare of the Nation, then he ju&s;tly Merits to have a Statue of Gold erected for him&s;elf: but if it &s;hall tend to the intire De&s;truction &amp; Abolition of our Na|tion; and that we the Nation's Tru&s;tees &s;hall go into it; then I mu&s;t &s;ay, That a Whip and a Bell, a Cock, a Viper, and an Ape, are but too &s;mall Puni&s;hments for any &s;uch bold unnatural Undertaking and Complai&s;ance.</P>
<P>That I may path a way, <HI>My Lord,</HI> to a full, calm and free Rea&s;oning upon this Affair, which is of the la&s;t Con&s;equence un|to this Nation; I &s;hall mind this Honourable Hou&s;e, that we are the Succe&s;&s;ors of our Noble Predece&s;&s;ors who founded our Mo|narchy, framed our Laws, amended, altered and corrected them from time to time, as the Affairs and Circum&s;tances of the Nation did require, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance or Advice of any Foreign Power or Potentate, and who, during the time of 2000 Years, have handed them down to us a free Independent Nation, with the Hazard of their Lives and Fortunes; Shall not we then ar|gue for that, which our Progenitors have purcha&s;ed for us at &s;o dear a Rate, and with &s;o much Immortal Honour and Glory? GOD forbid. Shall the Hazard of a Father unbind the Ligaments of a Dumb Son's Tongue; and &s;hall we hold our Peace, when our <HI>Patria</HI> is in Danger? I &s;peak this, <HI>My Lord,</HI> That I may incourage every Individual Member of this Hou&s;e, to &s;peak their Mind freely. There are many Wi&s;e and Prudent Men among&s;t us, who think it not worth their while to open their Mouths; there are others, who can &s;peak very well, and to good Purpo&s;e, who &s;helter them&s;elves under the &s;hameful Cloak of Silence, from a Fear of the Frowns of Great Men and Parties. I have ob&s;erved, <HI>My Lord,</HI> by my Experience, the greate&s;t Number of Speakers in the mo&s;t Trivial Affairs; and it will always prove &s;o, while we come not to the right Under&s;tanding of our Oath <HI>de fideli,</HI> where|by we are bound not only to give our Vote, but our Faithful Advice in Parliament, as we &s;hould <HI>An&s;wer to GOD;</HI> and in our
<PB N="37" REF="324">
Ancient Laws, the Repre&s;entatives of the Honourable Barons and the Royal Burrows are termed Spoke&s;men: It lyes upon your Lord&s;hips therefore, particularly to take notice of &s;uch, who&s;e Mode&s;ty makes them Ba&s;hful to Speak. Therefore I &s;hall leave it upon you, and conclude this Point, with a very Memorable Say|ing, of an Hone&s;t private Gentleman, to a great <HI>Queen,</HI> upon Occa&s;ion of a State Project, contrived by an able State&s;man, and the Favorite to a great <HI>King,</HI> again&s;t a Peaceable Obedient People, becau&s;e of the Diver&s;ity of their Laws and Con&s;titutions. <HI>If at this time thou hold thy Peace, Salvation &s;hall come to the People from another place, but thou and thy Hou&s;e &s;hall peri&s;h.</HI> I leave the Application to each particular Member of this Hou&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> I come now to con&s;ider our <HI>Divi&s;ions.</HI> We are under the Happy Reign (Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD) of the <HI>Be&s;t of Queens,</HI> Who has no Evil De&s;ign again&s;t the meane&s;t of Her Subjects, Who Loves all Her People, and is equally Beloved by them again; and yet, that, under the Happy Influence of our mo&s;t Excellent <HI>Queen,</HI> there &s;hould be &s;uch Divi&s;ions and Factions, more dange|rous and threatning to Her Dominions, than if we were under an Arbitrary Government, is mo&s;t &s;trange and unaccountable. Un|der an Arbitrary Prince, all are willing to Serve, becau&s;e all are under a Nece&s;&s;ity to Obey, whether they will or not. He choo&s;es therefore whom he will, without re&s;pect to either Parties or Facti|ons; and if he think fit to take the Advices of his Councils or Parliaments, every Man &s;peaks his Mind freely, and the Prince re|ceives the Faithful Advice of his People, without the Mixture of Self-de&s;igns: If he prove a Good Prince, the Government is ea&s;y; if Bad, either Death or a Revolution brings a Deliverance. Whereas here, <HI>My Lord,</HI> there appears no End of our Mi&s;ery, if not prevented in time; Factions are now become Independent, and have got Footing in Councils, in Parliaments, in Treaties, in Armies, in Incorporations, in Families, among Kindred, yea Man and Wife are not free from their Political Jarrs.</P>
<P>It remains therefore, <HI>My Lord,</HI> that I enquire into the Nature of the&s;e things, and &s;ince the Names give us not the Right Idea of the thing, I am afraid I will have Difficulty to make my &s;elf well under&s;tood.</P>
<P>The Names generally u&s;ed to denote the Factions, are <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Torie,</HI> as ob&s;cure as that of the <HI>Guelfs</HI> and <HI>Gibelins:</HI> Yea, <HI>My Lord,</HI> they have different Significations, as they are applyed to Factions in each Kingdom, a <HI>Whig</HI> in <HI>England</HI> is a Heterogene|ous Creature, in <HI>Scotland</HI> he is all of a piece; a <HI>Tory</HI> in <HI>England</HI> is all of a piece and a <HI>State&s;man,</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> he is quite other|ways, an Anti-courteour and Anti-&s;tate&s;man.</P>
<P>A <HI>Whig</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> appears to be &s;omewhat like <HI>Nebuchadnez|zar</HI>'s Image of different Mettals, different Cla&s;&s;es, different Prin|ciples and different De&s;igns; yet take them all together, they are like a piece of fine mixed Droggat of different Threeds, &s;ome Finer, &s;ome Cour&s;er, which after all make a comely Appearance,
<PB N="38" REF="325">
and an agreeable Suit. A <HI>Tory</HI> is like a piece of Loyal-made <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloath, the true Staple of the Nation, all of a Threed: yet if we look narrowly into it, we &s;hall perceive Diver&s;ity of Colours, which, according to the Various Situations and Po&s;itions, makes Various Appearances; &s;ometimes <HI>Tory</HI> is like the Moon in its Full, as appeared in the Affair of the <HI>Bill of the Occa&s;ional Conformity;</HI> upon other occa&s;ions it appears to be under Cloud, and as if it were Eclip&s;ed by a greater Body, as it did in the De&s;ign of the Calling over the Illu&s;trious Prince&s;s <HI>Sophia.</HI> However, by this we may &s;ee their de&s;igns are to out&s;hoot <HI>Whig</HI> in his own Bow.</P>
<P><HI>Whig</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> is a true blew <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> who, without Con|&s;idering Time or Power, will <HI>venture their All for the Kirk:</HI> but &s;omething le&s;s for the State. <HI>The greate&s;t Difficulty</HI> is, how to de&s;cribe a <HI>Scots Tory:</HI> Of old, when I knew them fir&s;t, <HI>Tory</HI> was an Hone&s;t Hearted Comradi&s;h Fellow, who, provided he were Maintain'd and Protected in his Benefices, Titles and Dignities by the State, he was the le&s;s anxious who had the Government and Management of the Church: but now, what he is &s;ince <HI>Jure-Divinity</HI> came in Fa&s;hon; and that Chri&s;tianity, and by Con&s;e|quence, Salvation, comes to depend upon Epi&s;copal Ordination, I profe&s;s I know not what to make of him; only this I mu&s;t &s;ay for him, That he endeavours to do, by Oppo&s;ition, that, which his Brother in <HI>England</HI> endeavours, by a more Prudent and le&s;s Scrupulous Method.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>My Lord,</HI> from the&s;e Divi&s;ions there has got up a kind of <HI>Ari&s;tocracy,</HI> &s;omething like the Famous Triumvirate at <HI>Rome,</HI> they are a kind of Undertakers and Pragmatick State&s;men, who, finding their Fower and Strength great, and an&s;werable to their De&s;igns, will make Bargains with our Gracious Sovereign, they will &s;erve Her faithfully, but upon their own Terms: they mu&s;t have their own In&s;truments, their own Mea&s;ures, this Man mu&s;t be turned out, and that Man put in, and then they'll make Her the mo&s;t <HI>Glorious Queen</HI> in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Where will this end, <HI>My Lord?</HI> Is not Her Maje&s;ty in Danger by &s;uch a Method? Is not the Monarchy in Danger? Is not the Nation's Peace and Tranquillity in Danger? Will a Change of Parties make the Nation more Happy? No, <HI>My Lord,</HI> the Seed is &s;owen, that is like to afford us a perpetual Increa&s;e; it's not an Annual Herb, it takes deep Root, it Seeds and Breeds; and, if not timeou&s;ly prevented by Her Maje&s;ty's Royal Endea|vours, will &s;plit the whole I&s;land in two.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> I think, con&s;idering our pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances at this time, the Almighty GOD has re&s;erved this great Work for us: We may Brui&s;e this <HI>Hydra</HI> of Divi&s;ion, and Cru&s;h this <HI>Cocka|trice</HI>'s Egg; our Neighbours in <HI>England</HI> are not yet fitted for any &s;uch thing, they are not under the Afflicting Hand of Providence, as we are; their Circum&s;tances are Great and Glorious, their Treaties are prudently managed both at Home and Abroad, their Generals Brave and Valorous, their Armies Succe&s;sful and Victorious, their

<P>It's quite otherways with us, <HI>My Lord,</HI> we are an Ob&s;cure poor People, tho' formerly of better account; removed to a remote cor|ner of the World, without Name and without Alliances, our Po&s;ts mean and precarious; &s;o that I profe&s;s, I don't think any one Po&s;t of the Kingdom worth the Briguing after, &s;ave that of being Com|mi&s;&s;ioner to a long Se&s;&s;ion of a Factious <HI>Scots</HI> Parliament, with an antedated Commi&s;&s;ion, and that yet renders the re&s;t of the Mini&s;ters more Mi&s;erable: What hinders us then, <HI>My Lord,</HI> to lay a&s;ide our Divi&s;ions to unite Cordially and heartily together in our pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, when <HI>our All is at the Stake; Hannibal, My Lord,</HI> is at our Gates, <HI>Hannibal</HI> is come within our Gates, <HI>Hannibal</HI> is come the length of this Table, he is at the Foot of this Throne, he will demoli&s;h this Throne, if we take not Notice he'll &s;ei&s;e upon the&s;e <HI>Regalia;</HI> he'll take them as our <HI>&s;polia opima,</HI> and whip us out of this Hou&s;e never to return again.</P>
<P>For the Love of GOD then, <HI>My Lord,</HI> for the Safety and Well|fare of our Ancient Kingdom, who&s;e &s;ad Circum&s;tances I hope we &s;hall yet Convert unto Pro&s;perity and Happine&s;s! We want no Means, if we Unite, GOD ble&s;&s;eth the Peace-makers, we want nei|ther Men nor Sufficiency of all manner of things nece&s;&s;ary, to make a Nation happy: all depends upon Management, <HI>Concordia res parvae cre&s;cunt.</HI> I fear not the&s;e Articles, tho they were ten times wor&s;e than they are, if we once Cordially forgive one another, and that according to our Proverb, <HI>bygones be bygones and fair play to come.</HI>) For my part in the &s;ight of GOD and in the pre&s;ence of this Honourable Hou&s;e I heartily forgive every Man, and beggs that they may do the &s;ame to me, and I do mo&s;t hum|bly propo&s;e, that his Grace <HI>My Lord Commi&s;&s;ioner</HI> may appoint an <HI>Agape,</HI> may order a Love-Fea&s;t for this Honourable Hou&s;e, that we may lay a&s;ide all &s;elf de&s;igns, and after our Fa&s;ts and Humilia|tions may have a day of Rejoicing and Thankfulne&s;s, may eat our Meat with Gladne&s;s, and our Bread with a Merry Heart, then &s;hall we <HI>&s;it each Man under his own Fig-tree,</HI> and <HI>the Voice of the Turtle</HI>

The fir&s;t Notice they &s;eem'd to take of us, was in our Affair of <HI>Caledonia,</HI> when they had mo&s;t effectually broke off that de&s;ign in a manner very well known to the World, and unnece&s;&s;ary to be repeated here, they kept them&s;elves quiet during the time of our Complaints upon that Head. In which time our Sovereign, to &s;atisfie the Nation and allay their Heats, did conde&s;cend to give us &s;ome good Laws, and among&s;t others that of Per&s;onal Liberties and of Peace and War; but <HI>England</HI> having declared their Succe&s;&s;ion and extended their Intail without ever taking Notice of us; our Gracious Sovereign QUEEN <HI>ANNE</HI> was Graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to give the Royal A&s;&s;ent to our <HI>Act of Security,</HI> and to give us a hedge to all our Sacred and Civil Intere&s;ts, by Declaring it High Trea&s;on to endeavour the Al|teration of them, as they were then E&s;tabli&s;hed. Thereupon did follow the Threatning and Minatory Laws again&s;t us by the Parli|ament of <HI>England</HI> and the unju&s;t and unequal Character of what Her Maje&s;ty had &s;o Graciou&s;ly Conde&s;cended to in our Favours: Now My <HI>Lord</HI> whether the de&s;ire they had to have us ingaged in the &s;ame Succe&s;&s;ion with them; Or whether that they found us like a free and independent People breathing after more Liberty than what formerly was lookt after; Or whether they were afraid of our <HI>Act of Security</HI> in ca&s;e of Her Maje&s;ties Decea&s;e: which of all the&s;e Motives has induced them to a Treaty I leave it to them&s;elves, this I mu&s;t &s;ay only, they have made a good Bargain this time al&s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="328">
For the particular Motives that induced us, I think, they are Obvious to be known; we found by &s;ad Experience, that every Man hath advanced in Power and Riches, as they have done in Trade, and at the &s;ame time con&s;idering that no where through the World, Slaves are found to be Rich, though they &s;hould be adorned with Chains of Gold, we thereupon changed our Notion of an Incorporating Union to that of a Federal one; and being re&s;olved to take this Opportunity to make Demands upon them, before we enter into the Succe&s;&s;ion, we were content to Impower Her Maje&s;ty to Authori&s;e and Appoint Commi&s;&s;ioners to Treat with the Commi&s;sioners of <HI>England,</HI> with as ample Powers as the Lords Commi&s;sioners from <HI>England</HI> had from their Con&s;tituents, that we might not appear to have le&s;s Confidence in Her Maje&s;ty, nor more narrow hearted in our Act than our Neighbours of <HI>Eng|land:</HI> and thereupon la&s;t Parliament, after Her Maje&s;ty's Gracious Letter was Read, De&s;iring us to declare the Succe&s;sion in the fir&s;t place, and afterwards to appoint Commi&s;sioners to Treat; we found it nece&s;&s;ary to renew our former <HI>Re&s;olve,</HI> which I &s;hall Read to this Honourable Hou&s;e. <Q><HI>Re&s;olve pre&s;ented by the Duke of</HI> Hamilton <HI>la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament.</HI><P>That this Parliament will not proceed to the Nomination of a Succe&s;&s;or, till we have had a previous Treaty with <HI>England,</HI> in Re|lation to our Commerce and other Concerns with that Nation.

<P>Now, <HI>My Lord,</HI> the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament having, before they would enter upon any Treaty with <HI>England,</HI> by a Vote of the Hou&s;e, pa&s;t both an Act for Limitations, and an Act for Rectification of our Con&s;titution. What mortal Man has rea&s;on to doubt, the De&s;ign of this Treaty was only Federal?</P>
<P><HI>My Lord Chancellor,</HI> It remains now, that we con&s;ider the Be|haviour of the Lords Commi&s;sioners at the opening of this Treaty. And before I enter upon that, allow me to make this Meditati|on, that if our Po&s;terity, after we are all dead and gone, &s;hall find them&s;elves under an ill made Bargain, and &s;hall have a re|cour&s;e unto our Records, and &s;ee who have been the Managers of that Treaty, by which they have &s;uffered &s;o much; when they read the Names, they will certainly conclude and &s;ay, Ah! our Nation has been reduced to the la&s;t Extremity, at the time of this Treaty; all our great Chieftains, all our great Peers and con&s;ide|rable Men; who u&s;ed formerly to defend the Rights and Liber|ties
<PB N="42" REF="329">
of the Nation, have been all Killed and Dead in the Bed of Honour, before ever the Nation was nece&s;sitate to Conde&s;cend to &s;uch Mean and Contemptible Terms; Where are the Names of the chief Men, of the Noble Families of <HI>Stewarts, Hamiltons, Grahams, Campbells, Gordons, John&s;tons, Homes, Murrays, Kers,</HI> &amp;c. Where are the two great Officers of the Crown, the <HI>Con&s;table</HI> and the <HI>Mari&s;chal</HI> of <HI>Scotland?</HI> They have certainly all been extingui&s;hed, and now we are Slaves for ever.</P>
<P>Whereas the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Records will make their Po&s;terity, Reve|rence the Memory of the Honourable Names who have brought under, their Fierce, Warlike and Trouble&s;ome Neighbours, who had Struggled &s;o long for Independency, &s;hed the be&s;t Blood of their Nation, and reduced a con&s;iderable Part of their Country to be|come Wa&s;te and De&s;olate.</P>
<P>I am Informed, <HI>My Lord,</HI> That our Commi&s;sioners did indeed frankly tell the Lords Commi&s;sioners for <HI>England,</HI> That the In|clination of the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> were much altered of late, in relation to an Incorporating Union, and that therefore &s;ince the Entail was to end with Her Maje&s;ty's Life, whom GOD long pre|&s;erve, it was proper to begin the Treaty upon the Foot of the Treaty the 1604 year of GOD, the time when we came fir&s;t un|der one Sovereign: but this the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commi&s;sioners would not agree to, and our Commi&s;sioners, that they might not &s;eem ob|&s;tinate, were willing to Treat and Conclude in the Terms laid be|fore this Honourable Hou&s;e, and &s;ubjected to their Determinati|on.</P>
<P>If the Lords Commi&s;sioners for <HI>England</HI> had been as Civil and Complai&s;ant, they &s;hould certainly have fini&s;hed a Federal Treaty likeways, that both Nations might have the Choice, which of them to have gone into as they thought fit; but they would hear of nothing but of an intire and compleat Union, a Name which comprehends an Union, either by Incorporation, Surrender or Con|que&s;t, whereas our Commi&s;sioners thought of nothing but a fair equal Incorporating Union; whether this be &s;o or no, I leave it to every Man's Judgment; but as for my &s;elf, I mu&s;t beg liberty to think it no &s;uch thing. For I take an Incorporating Union to be, where there is a change both in the material and formal Points of Government, as if two Pieces of Mettal were melted down into one Ma&s;s, it can neither be &s;aid to retain its former Form or Sub|&s;tance, as it did before the mixture. But now when I con&s;ider this Treaty, as it hath been Explained and Spoke to before us the&s;e three Weeks by pa&s;t, I &s;ee the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution remaining firm, the &s;ame two Hou&s;es of Parliament, the &s;ame Taxes, the &s;ame Cu&s;toms, the &s;ame Exci&s;es, the &s;ame Trade in Companies, the &s;ame Municipal Laws and Courts of Judicature, and all ours either &s;ub|ject to Regulations, or Annihilations: only we have the Honour to pay their old Debts, and to have &s;ome few Per&s;ons pre&s;ent for Witne&s;&s;es to the Validity of the Deed, when they are plea&s;ed to contract more.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="330">
 Good GOD! What is this an intire Surrender?</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> I find my Heart &s;o full of Grief and Indignation, That I mu&s;t beg Pardon, not to fini&s;h the la&s;t part of my Di&s;cour&s;e, that I may drop a Tear as the Prelude to &s;o &s;ad a Story.</P></Q> After having &s;it down, and &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;es by other Mem|bers interveening, he continued his Di&s;cour&s;e thus,<Q><P><HI>My Lord Chancellor,</HI> What I am now to &s;ay, relates to the Me|thod of Proceeding in this Weighty Affair: I hear it propo&s;ed by a Noble Member of the other &s;ide, that we &s;hould proceed in the &s;ame Order, as the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners Treaters did. In my humble Opinion, <HI>My Lord,</HI> It is neither the natural Method, nor can it be done without great Confu&s;ion and Repetition. To &s;ay, You'll agree to the Union of the two Kingdoms, before you agree in the Terms upon which they are to be United, &s;eems like <HI>driving the Plough before the Oxen:</HI> The Articles, which narrate the Con|ditions, &s;eem to be the Premi&s;&s;es, upon which the Conclu&s;ion is inferred; and, according as they are found good or bad, the Succe&s;s will follow. When a Man is Married to a Fortune in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> as they call it, I &s;uppo&s;e he is &s;atisfied with the thing be|fore he determines him&s;elf to Marry; and the Propo&s;al I have heard of agreeing to the fir&s;t Article with a <HI>Provi&s;o,</HI> That, if the re&s;t of the Articles &s;hall be found Satisfactory, and no otherwi&s;e, is of a Piece with the re&s;t, and looks like Beating the Air, and no|ways Con&s;i&s;tent with fair and &s;quare Dealings. Be&s;ides, <HI>My Lord,</HI> if we were to go upon the fir&s;t Article, are not all the re&s;t of the Articles, be&s;ides many others not contained in the Ar|ticles, valid Arguments either, <HI>Pro</HI> or <HI>Con,</HI> again&s;t Concluding, or not Concluding the fir&s;t Article? And no Vote in this Hou&s;e, can hinder a Man, from making u&s;e of what Arguments he thinks fit. Moreover, the Searching the Records, and the Revi&s;ing the <HI>Statute Books,</HI> Comparing <HI>the Books of Rates, Cu&s;toms, Exci&s;e, Taxes,</HI> of both Nations, with one another, mu&s;t all be previou&s;ly con&s;i|dered, ere we determine our &s;elves in one &s;ingle Article; Add to this, That the Prohibitory Clau&s;e, with Relation to the Trade of both Nations, mu&s;t be Adju&s;ted, le&s;t, like <HI>E&s;op</HI>'s Dog, we lo&s;e the Old, in Gra&s;ping at the New; the State of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Compa|nies mu&s;t al&s;o be Expo&s;ed, how far we &s;hall have Liberty into them, and what Advantage we may propo&s;e to our &s;elves, by Trading to the&s;e Places, where they are &s;ecured, and above all, <HI>My Lord,</HI> the Security of our National Church, and of all that's dear unto us, mu&s;t be previou&s;ly E&s;tabli&s;hed to us, if practicable, before we Conclude the fir&s;t Article. Therefore, <HI>My Lord,</HI> tho my particular Opinion be, tho we had a <HI>Cart Blanch</HI> from <HI>Eng|land;</HI> yet the Delivery up of our Sovereignty, gives back with one Hand, what we receive with the other, and that there can be no Security, without the Guarrantee of a Di&s;tinct Independen|cy betwixt the Parties Treating: Yet, <HI>My Lord,</HI> for further Sa|tisfaction
<PB N="44" REF="331">
to this Honourable Hou&s;e, That every Member may fully &s;atisfie him&s;elf, I humbly propo&s;e, That, pa&s;&s;ing by the fir&s;t three Articles, which appear to be much of a Piece, we begin at the fourth Article of the Treaty, and if I be &s;econded in this, I de&s;ire it may be put to the Que&s;tion.</P></Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall make no Remarks upon this la&s;t and famous Speech, the Noble Per&s;on that &s;poke it, however he happened to mi&s;take in &s;ome things, was a Per&s;on of extraordinary Parts and Capacity; And as he was very warm again&s;t the Uni|on, it made that Oppo&s;ition the more con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>This Speech, the Reader may &s;ee, was pointed directly again&s;t the Union, and in the fir&s;t part of it argues again&s;t the Whole, in the la&s;t again&s;t the Parts&mdash;; but concludes to move again&s;t the immediate Proceedings.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Speech was from a Per&s;on no le&s;s capable in the Matter of the Treaty, and that had been a Commi&s;&s;ioner in the Treaty at <HI>London;</HI> The Speeches are directly oppo&s;ite, and are left thus upon Record to argue again&s;t one another.</P>
<P>The time had been taken up with their length, and the Hou&s;e, as well as the Nation, was, at this time, in an Un|u&s;ual Ferment, &s;o not many Replies were made. Mr. <HI>Seton,</HI> who made the fir&s;t Speech, &s;tood up to An&s;wer the Lord <HI>Beilhaven,</HI> but, as he had already &s;poken, the Orders of the Hou&s;e, <HI>viz. That the &s;ame Member could not &s;peak twice in the &s;ame Cau&s;e,</HI> were urged again&s;t his &s;peaking, and the Earl of <HI>Ma&mdash;mont</HI> &s;tanding up to &s;peak at the &s;ame time, the Lord Chancellor gave place to him; who indeed made a very &s;hort Return to &s;o long a Speech, and which An&s;wer occa&s;ioned &s;ome Laughter in the Hou&s;e: The Earl of <HI>Ma&mdash;monts</HI> Speech was to this Purpo&s;e, <HI>viz. He had heard a long Speech and a very terrible one, but he was of Opinion, it required a &s;hort An&s;wer,</HI> which he gave in the&s;e Words, <HI>Behold he Dream'd, but, lo! when he awoke, he found it was a Dream;</HI> This An&s;wer, &s;ome &s;aid, was as Satisfactory to the Members, who under&s;tood the De&s;ign of that Speech, as if it had been An&s;wered Vi&s;ion by Vi&s;ion.</P>
<P>After the&s;e two Speeches, &s;everal Members &s;poke <HI>Pro</HI> and <HI>Con;</HI> But the Debate, in Clo&s;e of the Day, turned &s;o Warm, That, at the De&s;ire of the Hou&s;e, it was Adjourned to the next <HI>Sederunt.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XV.</HEAD>
<P>It is very remarkable, That the Addre&s;&s;es now began to Throng upon the Hou&s;e, and we find them at the beginning of every Vote; The Debates of this Day vi&s;ibly di&s;covered the Rea&s;on and De&s;ign of procuring the&s;e Addre&s;&s;es, <HI>viz.</HI> That they might form an Argument from the general Aver|&s;ions of the Nation, and from thence, &amp; the bringing the Soul|diers into the City, it was called a Cramming the Union down their Throats.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time it was vi&s;ible, there were &s;uch Methods made u&s;e of to procure Addre&s;&s;es, &s;uch want of Hands, &s;uch kinds of People who &s;igned, &s;uch a Paucity of Gentry, where the Counties were full of Gentlemen, and &s;uch Varieties of Circum&s;tances concurring, to make it appear, that it was the labour'd performance of a Party, that, <HI>it was thought,</HI> they met with the le&s;s regard.</P>
<P>There were indeed in &s;everal places Addre&s;&s;es prepared from the Gentry of the Country for the Encouragement of the Treaty, but it was concluded to be needle&s;s, &s;ince that would have been a kind of telling No&s;es without Doors, and the Party would have been plea&s;ed, to have had it pa&s;t for a &s;ort of Polling the Nation, in which, they having before di&s;&s;atisfied and allarm'd the common People, they had the mo&s;t Hopes of Succe&s;s&mdash;; This therefore was laid a&s;ide, as a Step that would be of no u&s;e, and would put the Uni|on upon a Tryal altogether incon&s;i&s;tent with the Con&s;titution, and, as it were, debate it <HI>a-la-Mob.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore none of the Addre&s;&s;es on the other &s;ide were pre&s;ented, tho I have the Originals of &s;ome by me, which were actually &s;ign'd by the Country Gentlemen, and which were highly Expre&s;&s;ive of their A&s;&s;ent to the Treaty, and of their Rea&s;ons for it, &s;ome of which were particularly the Danger of Popery, and of Introducing the old Tyranny in the Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="335">
Nor can it but be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed, That had the Noblemen and Gentlemen of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as well in the Parli|ament as without, who were Hearty in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Union, gone Home, and rai&s;ed their Tenants, Va&s;&s;als, and Dependencies, to have appeared for the Union, either in the Addre&s;&s;es, or in the Field, they would, taking it at fir&s;t, as much have Overpowered the other Party without Doors, as they Outvoted them within, &s;ince it was known, that except the Duke of <HI>At&mdash;le,</HI> the principal Number of the Oppo&s;ers, were not Men of the greate&s;t Intere&s;t in their Country, I mean as to the Command of their Va&s;&s;als and Attendants.</P>
<P>But they never brought it to the Extremity of that Tryal, and therefore the Motions of the Party as to General Aver|&s;ions, being laid a&s;ide, they found them&s;elves under a Nece&s;&s;ity of Struggling in Parliament only.</P>
<P>The Endeavours of Mobbing the Parliament were &s;uppre&s;t, and the Addre&s;&s;es obtained only a Reading, but had no direct An&s;wer given them, other than the Proceedings of the Hou&s;e of Cour&s;e, made out; the Thing now to be carried on within Doors was, to load the Treaty with Impracticable Amendments, while the Party without Doors endeavoured on the one Hand, to rai&s;e Tumults in the Country, bring up popular Addre&s;&s;es, and at la&s;t, down-right Rebellion, as in its place will appear: And on the other Hand, to Di&s;plea&s;e and Di&s;&s;atisfie the Mini&s;ters, and bring them to appear publickly Unea&s;y; Of which we &s;hall &s;ee further in its place.</P>
<P>The Debates of this day were very Warm, and &s;everal long Speeches were made, but it was impo&s;&s;ible to obtain Ab&s;tracts of Speeches, which we could but ju&s;t hear, and I &s;hall not venture to Injure, either the Speaker or Hearer, by impo&s;ing my Language upon them, to Expre&s;s what others &s;aid.</P>
<P>Long Debates were offered to the &s;econd part of the Vote above, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Union was Impracticable, that the Joyning of Nations could not be, would tend to Con|fu&s;ion, and be nece&s;&s;arily broken, as in the Vote. This was rai&s;ed upon the afore&s;aid Book of Mr. <HI>Hodges,</HI> and proved evi|dently, that it was not his Hypothe&s;is, but a Concert of Heads&mdash;, and his interfeiring Intere&s;ts were here di&s;cour&s;'d of.</P>
<P>I am not willing, to Examine into the Incon&s;i&s;tencies of &s;ome peoples Notions, &s;tarted here in Matters of Intere&s;ts, and how they rai&s;ed Objections, which were not Grounded on Fact, E&s;pecially in Matters of Trade, I bury them in Silence, in re&s;pect to the Gentlemen; But it was next to Miraculous, to hear Men of &s;en&s;e alledge, That <HI>England</HI> got nothing by her <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Trade, that mo&s;t of her Forreign Trade was Engro&s;&s;ed by exclu&s;ive Companies, that <HI>Scotland</HI>
<PB N="49" REF="336">
got nothing by Trading with <HI>England,</HI> that <HI>Scotland</HI> could Gain by any Foreign Trade but <HI>England,</HI> and the like; the&s;e things will more evidently be detected hereafter.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, a Federal Union was offered, <HI>That was under&s;tood,</HI> any thing but the Right, any thing but the Treaty now begun, be|andu&s;e, could they have obtain'd a Vote again&s;t the pre&s;ent Teaty, the gaining Time for another Parliament had followed, and the De&s;ign of putting off, or delaying Time, had taken Effect.</P>
<P>Some Gentlemen, with extraordinary Rea&s;on and Force of Argument, endeavoured to Explain them the Ab&s;urdities and Incon&s;i&s;tencies of that Project, &amp; put the Hou&s;e in mind, that it was not a Federal Union, or a better Union that tho&s;e Gentlemen de&s;ired, but really no Union at all; And that the De&s;ign was to Defeat the Endeavours of the Union only, in order to bring in <HI>French</HI> Bondage, and King <HI>James</HI> VIII upon them.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the other Party &s;oon &s;aw in the Hou&s;e, it would go again&s;t them, &amp; therefore, before it was put to the Vote, the Duke of <HI>A&mdash;ole</HI> gave in his Prote&s;t, as in the Vote, toge|ther with the whole Party of Oppo&s;ets, on what&s;oever prin|ciple they Oppo&s;ed; which Prote&s;t they had ready Concerted before, expecting, as was &s;uppo&s;ed, Things would go as they did, and that they &s;hould be Overpowered in the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I can not but Note here, that this great Debate, and on which the whole Weight of the Matter depended, happened on that Famous Day to <HI>Britain,</HI> I mean the very Day on which the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> afterward King <HI>William</HI> came to <HI>England,</HI> and was al&s;o the Birth-day of that Glorious Mo|narch.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame day, now a &s;econd time, the Fate of <HI>Britain</HI> had a new Turn, and the &s;ucce&s;s of that gave a plea&s;ant pre&s;age to many ob&s;erving People of the future happy I&s;&s;ue of the Thing now in hand.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen, who let &s;lip no occa&s;ion to puzzle the Debates of this Matter, had now conceiv'd great hopes of a Broil among the Mini&s;ters, and were exceeding bu&s;ie, to fill the Heads of &s;ome of the Gentlemen of the Clergy with Jea|lou&s;ies and Di&s;&s;atisfactions&mdash;, and yet I can not &s;ay, they brought in the Overture at this time, tho' they were always forward to pu&s;h on that &s;ide too.</P>
<P>I can not &s;ay neither, that they met with no Encouragement here, or that there were no WarmHeads to be found in the Com|mi&s;&s;ion, who apter to take Fire than was to be wi&s;hed, were more ea&s;ily gain'd, but if there were any &s;uch, the Prudence and Moderation of the re&s;t of the Commi&s;&s;ion, &s;o Over-ruled them, as kept them from any Precipitations, and Contributed greatly to the General Safety; Of which I have &s;poken more largely in its place.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XVII.</HEAD>
<P>I have already given an account of the Birth of this Paper called, <HI>The Repre&s;entation and Petition,</HI> and the &s;everal Diffi|culties it met with in the Commi&s;&s;ion of the A&s;&s;embly, and which, &s;ome have &s;aid, was a Rea&s;on, why it met with le&s;s Encouragement in the Parliament, than was expected, but it may be worth Notice, that notwith&s;tanding it did not meet with a very kind Reception, &s;ome of the Gentlemen having been di&s;obliged in the Ca&s;e of their Prote&s;t, yet the Hou&s;e did not wholly Omit the Things de&s;ired in it.</P>
<P>Some of the Gentlemen, who, as Ruling Elders, had pro|te&s;ted in the Commi&s;&s;ion, had it &s;eems met with &s;ome Per|&s;onal Reflections from the Ra&s;hne&s;s of &s;ome Members; that was di&s;obliging enough, and upon which they had withdrawn them&s;elves from the Commi&s;&s;ion, and &s;eldom, if at all, came there any more during the whole Sitting; And tho' the Ra&s;hne&s;s of the Per&s;ons who gave tho&s;e Reflections, was not Approved by the Commi&s;&s;ion, yet it &s;tuck a little too clo&s;s with &s;ome People, and it was thought, made them le&s;s careful of the Application made by the Mini&s;ters in this Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Upon the receiving the Repre&s;entation or Petition into the Hou&s;e, there were no Debates of any Con&s;equence, it was only Read, and the Act of Security being as <HI>per</HI> the Minutes Adjourned, the other lay by of Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The Money Bill now came on, and as the other Party thought the &s;peeding of it might be a Step, to put an End to the Se&s;&s;ion, they all came into it, and gave it all the di&s;patch po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="340">
It was apparent, that in order to break up this Treaty, the Gentlemen &s;tudied all po&s;&s;ible Methods to rai&s;e the Par|liament&mdash;, this they could never have done while the Funds remained Un&s;ettled, becau&s;e it being a Thing of &s;uch Con&s;equence to the Kingdom, the whole Countrey would have laid it at their Door, and the Queen would have had the highe&s;t Affront put upon both Her Per&s;on and Govern|ment imaginable; And therefore this was one of the fir&s;t Things they pu&s;ht at, and that made it pa&s;s immediately with no Oppo&s;ition at all, tho&s;e Gentlemen complying with it as it was removing an Ob&s;truction to their General De&s;ign.</P>

<P>The Amendments here made to the Act for Security of the Church, make it evident, that the Parliament did not &s;light|ly pa&s;s over that Affair, as &s;ome people pretended they would do, tho' they did not enter into the Debate of the In&s;ufficien|cy which &s;ome offered, as Things which tended not to Amend|ments of the Act as it was offered, but to a Rupture of the Debate; for the People who offered at the In&s;ufficiency of the Act, went upon this Foot; Not that this Overture or Act was an In&s;ufficient Security, but that really the Union with <HI>England</HI> as an Epi&s;copal Nation, was Incon&s;i&s;tent with the Safety of the Church of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and that not this Act only was, but any other Act that could be made, would be In&s;ufficient to &s;ecure the Church of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>This appeared to be the plain De&s;ign, in that as I have already noted, the Gentlemen that &s;poke Loude&s;t for the In&s;ufficiency of the Act of Security, were not of tho&s;e People, who really were mo&s;t concerned for the Safety of the Church of <HI>Scotland;</HI> the Objections al&s;o were not Calculated for Amendments or Additions, but for De|&s;troying the Bill it &s;elf, as Built on the &s;uppo&s;ition of a Union, which, they &s;aid, Was a Foundation that would not bear &s;uch a Super&s;tructure&mdash;. And tho' &s;ome well meaning Men too were of Opinion, that the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> could not really be &s;afe in a Union within <HI>England;</HI> yet the&s;e Gentlemen, as is noted, applyed it purely as an Ob&s;tacle to the Union, and as a Thing by which means, they hoped, to render the Union Univer&s;ally Odious and Terrible to the People.</P>
<P>And this will be more apparent from the Prote&s;t entered into, after all the Clau&s;es were Read, and after all Amend|ments, that could be rea&s;onably de&s;ired, were agreed to, as will appear in the next days Minute.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XIX.</HEAD>
<P>The reading of the Act of Security having been begun la&s;t day, &s;everal Amendments were offered, &s;uch as fir&s;t the Enu|merating the Acts of Parliament upon which it was grounded; This admitted no long Debates, if it had had any Significa|tion, it would have been granted, but it was generally e&s;teemed a thing of no value, meerly unnece&s;&s;ary and trifling, and as &s;uch was rejected: The Rea&s;on given was, becau&s;e one Act is particularly &s;pecified to be ratified by this Treaty, <HI>to wit,</HI> The 4<HI>th Act</HI> of the 1<HI>&s;t Parliament</HI> of King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> Intituled, <HI>An Act Ratifying the Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, and Settling Presbyterian Church Government,</HI> and then it mentions, <HI>With the hail other Acts relating thereunto,</HI> which was thought &s;ufficient and full enough.</P>
<P>The next Amendment was for the Colleges, which was found rea&s;onable, and was hinted by &s;ome, who had, not without ju&s;t Cau&s;e ob&s;erved, how much the Schools of the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England</HI> are regretted by &s;ome People, who en|vy the Encrea&s;e of their Number; And this therefore, as a mo&s;t rea&s;onable Demand, was immediately agreed to by the the Parliament, and is made part of the Act, as will appear by the Draught of the Bill.</P>
<P>The Fourth Clau&s;e had an Objection of greater Moment depending on it, which cau&s;ed long Debates, and was built on a Foundation, however plau&s;ible and ju&s;t in it &s;elf, had yet &s;uch a known Impo&s;&s;ibility before it, <HI>morally &s;peaking,</HI> as that no &s;mall Hopes were conceived from it, that it would &s;hock the whole Treaty.</P>
<P>All Men know, That, in <HI>England,</HI> by the <HI>TEST ACT, as it is called,</HI> all Per&s;ons that obtain any Office, Civil or Mili|tary, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are obliged to take the Sacrament, according to the U&s;age of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and to bring Certifi|cates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the &s;ame, under pain of Incapacity, among
<PB N="57" REF="344">
other Penalties: Now it was a mo&s;t plau&s;ible Argument, That, if the Subjects of both Kingdoms were to enjoy equal Privileges, the Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> taking the Sacrament in the National Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> ought to be as capable of Places or Offices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as the Subjects of <HI>England</HI> taking the Sacrament in the National Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Nor was this Matter carried a little Way, but became the Subject of infinite Di&s;contents without Doors, and of long Di&s;putes within&mdash;; It was &s;ugge&s;ted <HI>and printed too, by the &s;ame Author, of whom mention is already made, as Writing again&s;t the &V;nion,</HI> That all the Members of Parliament in <HI>England</HI> were obliged to take the Sacrament before they could &s;it in the Hou&s;e, but this, <HI>as fal&s;e in Fact,</HI> was cru&s;h'd at fir&s;t, &s;everal Accounts being given of its being quite otherways&mdash;; But then this Clau&s;e coming in upon the Neck of that Surmi&s;e, it was thought a Popular Argument, and indeed was &s;o: And the People began to be very unea&s;y about it, &s;aid the Parliament would give up all to the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> That this was &s;o fair a Thing, it could not be argued again&s;t, and in|deed a great many People looked upon the Thing, <HI>viz. taking of the Engli&s;h TEST,</HI> as what they wi&s;hed earne&s;tly enough to have done; but the more penetrating Judg|ments &s;aw further into the Depth of this, and finding it a De|&s;ign purely &s;trikeing at the Root of the Union, they were the rather inclined to drop it, tho' they at the &s;ame time de&s;ired it&mdash;, the Difficulty lying in this, That the Sacramental Te&s;t being a thing the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament have been very Tenacious of, upon all Occa&s;ions, this would be to ask &s;omething which they knew would not be granted, and con&s;equently put the Treaty to a Stop.</P>
<P>Others again propo&s;ed a Reciprocal Te&s;t to be placed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to &s;ecure <HI>or exclude all &s;uch of the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Nation, as would not acknowlege this Church, &amp;c.</HI> The Tenor of this was according to the following Copy, which they called a <HI>Formula.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I</HI> A. B. <HI>do Swear and Declare, That the Presbyterian Go|vernment of this Church is a lawful Government, and that I &s;hall neither, directly nor indirectly, do any thing to the Alteration thereof.</HI></P>
<P>But this al&s;o dropped of it &s;elf, for &s;ome People that were neverthele&s;s again&s;t the Union; yet were again&s;t this &s;ort of Reciprocal Oath, as a thing they did not approve on any Ac|count one or other.</P>
<P>there were &s;ome &s;mall Amendments to the Fifth and Sixth Clau&s;e, but not of Con&s;equence, and thus this difficult Mat|ter was pa&s;t into a Law.</P>
<P>There were &s;ome who clamour'd very much on this Head, and a great many per&s;onal Reflections were made, I will not &s;ay, altogether without Cau&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Church was aban|doned by her own Friends, <HI>or at lea&s;t by tho&s;e who pretended to be &s;o;</HI> That, if they had asked more, it might have been
<PB N="58" REF="345">
obtained; and that the Demands the Mini&s;ters made, were not duly weighed, <HI>much le&s;s an&s;wered;</HI> but yet it &s;eems, on the whole, that the main Foundation Article, <HI>viz.</HI> The E|&s;tabli&s;hment of the Church Government unalterable, was effec|tually &s;ecured; and tho' &s;ome particulars might be omitted, the Church has no open place left, at which her Enemies can wound her Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>There were great Clamours rai&s;ed, both within and without the Hou&s;e, about the In&s;ufficiency of this Act of Se|curity, as that it was <HI>le&s;&s;ening the Security the Church already had by the Claim of Right,</HI> and not providing an Equivalent Security in the Room of it; That the very Treating of it, im|plyed a further Security was needful, and yet no further Secu|rity was provided, than alone confirming the Claim of Right.</P>
<P>This was the Foundation of the Propo&s;al of the Reciprocal Te&s;t, or an Oath to &s;ecure the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in like manner, as the Te&s;t Act is for the Security of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> Of which above.</P>
<P>Another Objection was, That tho' indeed the Act of <HI>Wil|liam</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> was confirmed, yet, that the Act declaring it to be High Trea&s;on to Impugn the Claim of Right was not confirmed, nor the other Acts relating thereto &s;pecified&mdash;; Nor &s;ome Ancient ob&s;olete Acts taken away, which &s;tand unrepealed, and which are incon&s;i&s;tent with Presbyterian Government.</P>
<P>This was An&s;wered, particularly as to Enumerating the Acts <HI>as above</HI> and as to Repealing the Acts, the Twenty Fifth Ar|ticle of the Union declares all Acts contraveening this Trea|ty to be &s;o far, as they do &s;o contraveen this Treaty, <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> Repealed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Again it was objected, That here was no Provi&s;ion made for Prevention of Mi&s;chief to the Church, for want of a Com|mi&s;&s;ion or Court for Plantation of Kirks, and Valuation of Teinds, which is what the Church will be in great want of.</P>
<P>This was effectually An&s;wered, by &s;ettling an Act of Par|liament, previous to the Union, for the Plantation of Kirks and Valuation of Teinds, <HI>Impowering the Lords of Council and Se&s;&s;ion to Judge, Cogno&s;ce and Determine in all Affairs and Cau&s;es what&s;oever, which, by the Laws and Acts of Parliament of this Kingdom, were formerly referred to, and did pertain and belong to the Juri&s;diction and Cognizance of the Commi&s;&s;ioners formerly appointed for that Effect, as fully and freely in all re&s;pects, as the &s;aid Lords do or may in other Civil Cau&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>The great and main Objections were again&s;t the Po&s;&s;ibility of either Church or State being &s;ecured &s;o by this Treaty, as that a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament might not overwhelm it again by Plurality of Voices, which is a &s;uppo&s;ed Con&s;ent.</P>
<P>This, as the &s;ame, with the general Objection again&s;t the Union, was an&s;wered in the general Terms of the Union,
<PB N="59" REF="346">
<HI>viz.</HI> That this was to remain Unalterable for ever, and there|fore could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to be Temporary.</P>
<P>Upon the Debate of the&s;e Things its plain, what I have &s;o often alledged on the&s;e Gentlemen, and which therefore is not putting it as my Opinion, which I am not at all forward to offer to the World; but it appears, That the Objection of the Gentlemen did not &s;o much ly again&s;t particular Clau|&s;es, tho' they thought fit to di&s;pute their Ground by Inches there too, but this Objection lay again&s;t the general Head, <HI>The &V;nion,</HI> and they brought every Head, as they went thro' them, to &s;hock directly with the whole Treaty.</P>
<P>Thus in the Prote&s;t given in here by the Lords Di&s;&s;enting, it is expre&s;ly &s;aid, That the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> can have no real and &s;olid Security by any manner of Union, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;as <HI>per</HI> the Minute.</P>
<P>Al&s;o it is to be noted here, That the Gentlemen <HI>of that &s;ide</HI> were the fir&s;t who Moved to Print the Names of all tho&s;e that Voted to the fir&s;t Article, <HI>Pro</HI> and <HI>Con,</HI> which was thought at that time a day, an Expo&s;ing the Per&s;ons to the popular Re&s;entment, the Tumults of the People beginning to be at that time very high.</P>
<P>But the other Party, who had agreed voluntarily to the, &s;aid Printing of Names, took the Advantage now, and Mov'd, That the &s;ame might be done al&s;o, in the Vote about the Church, by which the Epi&s;copal Party were brought in, prote&s;ting in behalf of the Church: The Gentlemen would have avoid|ed it, but having been the fir&s;t in putting the like upon the other, they could not &s;hun it: This Expo&s;ed them very much, and opened the Eyes of many of the People, when they &s;aw &s;uch People Voting for the Church, who never own'd the Church in their Lives; and others Voting again&s;t the Thing, who were con&s;tant Members of the Church, and had given con&s;tant proof of their Zeal for the Churches advantage.</P>
<P>And thus the Act of Security was pa&s;t, and after Engro&s;&s;ed into the Body of the Articles, as will appear by the Act of Parliament.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXI.</HEAD>
<P>The Debates of this Day made yet a larger Di&s;covery of the Affair, and the Gentlemen who were again&s;t the Union, &s;truggling on all Occa&s;ions again&s;t the going on of the Ar|ticles, took now a new mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The Marque&s;s of <HI>An&mdash;dale</HI> made this Motion for the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion, as appeared by the Lord <HI>Beilhavens</HI> Speech; There had been a Party of Gentlemen, as was before ob&s;erved, who were always for the Succe&s;&s;ion with Limitations, but were oppo&s;ed by others who were intirely again&s;t' the Succe&s;|&s;ion at all, as it re&s;pected the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hannover:</HI> But as &s;everal People differing in their other Sentiments, yet joyned in their oppo&s;ing the Union, &s;o here the &s;tronge&s;t Oppo&s;ers of the Succe&s;&s;ion came now into the Thing they had &s;o long oppo&s;ed, and moved now for the Succe&s;&s;ion with Limitations, in order to avoid the Union.</P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Beilhaven</HI> &s;econded this with another Speech, which was afterward printed, in which his Lord&s;hip moved for &s;ettling the Succe&s;&s;ion upon the Prince&s;s <HI>Sophia</HI> of <HI>Hannover &amp;c.</HI> I have printed this Speech the rather, becau&s;e it is really the Sub&s;tance or Recital of three Speeches, as will be &s;een in the particulars of it, and &s;hews plainer than I can otherways ex|pre&s;s, how that part was acted.<Q><P><HI>My Lord Chancellor.</HI></P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip may remember the la&s;t day, when we had under Con&s;ideration, whether to proceed to the <HI>Fourth</HI> or <HI>Second Article,</HI> That I did Witne&s;s my Con|cern and Re&s;entment, to find &s;o many Honourable and Worthy Members of this Hou&s;e, &s;o forward to fini&s;h the Demands of <HI>England,</HI> in this Treaty; without tak|ing Notice of any one Article, that could be properly &s;aid to relate to the Demands of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Now, that we are entered upon the <HI>Second Article,</HI> I de&s;ire to be re&s;olved in one <HI>Q&V;ESTION, What are the Motives, that &s;hould engage us to take</HI> England<HI>'s Succe&s;|&s;or upon their own Terms?</HI> Is it not &s;trange, that no
<PB N="64" REF="351">
<HI>ANSWER</HI> &s;hould be given to this Que&s;tion, &s;ave that, <HI>When you come to con&s;ider the re&s;t of the Articles, you &s;hall be &s;atisfied on that Demand?</HI> This is a new way of Ar|guing, <HI>My Lord,</HI> a Method without Precedent, ranver|&s;ing Nature; and looks more like De&s;ign than Fair-Dealing. I profe&s;s, I think the Huge and Prodigious Rains, that we have had of late, have either drowned out, or found out another Channel for <HI>Rea&s;oning,</HI> than what was formerly; for by what I can &s;ee by this <HI>New Method,</HI> the Agreeing to the <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> Article, &s;hall be found a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on, why we &s;hould agree to the <HI>Second,</HI> and the Agreeing to the <HI>Second</HI> for the <HI>Third,</HI> and &s;o for all.</P>
<P>If there was ever &s;uch a Farce acted; if ever Rea&s;on was <HI>Hudibras'd,</HI> this is the time: Con&s;ult all the Treaties &s;ince the beginning of the World to this day, and if you can find any one Precedent, I &s;hall yield the Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall In&s;tance, <HI>My Lord,</HI> one for all, and that is, The fir&s;t and wor&s;t Treaty that ever was &s;et on Foot for Mankind; and yet, I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, there appears more Ingenuity in it, than in our Procedure: When the <HI>Serpent</HI> did Deceive our Mother <HI>Eve,</HI> he propo&s;ed three Advantages, before he pre&s;um'd to Advi&s;e her to to <HI>Eat the Forbidden Fruit:</HI> The <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> was taken from the <HI>Sight,</HI> the <HI>Second</HI> from the <HI>Ta&s;te,</HI> and the <HI>Third</HI> from the <HI>Advantage</HI> following thereupon. That from the <HI>Sight,</HI> was inforced by a <HI>Behold, how lovely and comely a thing it is, it's plea&s;ant to the Eye.</HI> That from the <HI>Ta&s;te,</HI> from a Per&s;wa&s;ion, that it was Good for Nouri&s;hment, <HI>it's good for Food.</HI> That from the <HI>Advantage,</HI> it will <HI>make you wi&s;e, ye &s;hall be as the Gods;</HI> therefore, upon all the&s;e Con&s;iderations, <HI>Eat.</HI></P>
<P>Allow me, <HI>My Lord,</HI> to run the Parallel of this, with Relation to our Procedure in this <HI>Treaty.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the fir&s;t Account that our Nation had, of the Treaty's being fini&s;hed betwixt the two Nations, People appeared all generally very well &s;atisfied, as a thing that would tend to the Removal of all Jealou&s;ies, and the &s;ettling a good Under&s;tanding betwixt the two Kingdoms. But, &s;o &s;oon as the <HI>Articles of the Treaty</HI> ap|peared in Print, the very Sight of them made &s;uch a Change, as is almo&s;t inconceivable; they were &s;o far from being plea&s;ant to the Eye, <HI>My Lord,</HI> that the Na|tion appears to abhor them.</P>
<P>One would think, <HI>My Lord,</HI> That it had been the Intere&s;t of tho&s;e, who are &s;atisfied with the Thing, to have gone immediately into the Merits of the&s;e particu|lar Articles which relate to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to have &s;aid, <HI>Gentlemen, be not affrighted with their ugly Shape, they are better than they are bonny; Come, Ta&s;te, come make a</HI>
<PB N="65" REF="352">
<HI>narrow Search and Inquiry, they are good for</HI> Scotland, <HI>the whole&s;ome&s;t Food that a Decaying Nation can take: You &s;hall find the Advantages, you &s;hall find a Change of Condition, you &s;hall become Rich immediately; you &s;hall be like the</HI> Engli&s;h, <HI>the mo&s;t Flouri&s;hing and Riche&s;t People of the &V;niver&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>But our Procedure, <HI>My Lord,</HI> hath been very far from the Prudence of the <HI>Serpent;</HI> for all our Arguments have run upon this blunt Topick, <HI>Eat, &s;wallow down this Incorporating &V;nion, tho it plea&s;e neither Eye nor Ta&s;te, it mu&s;t go over: You mu&s;t believe your Phy&s;icians, and we &s;hall con&s;ider the Rea&s;ons for it afterwards.</HI></P>
<P>I wi&s;h, <HI>My Lord,</HI> That our Lo&s;s be not in &s;ome &s;mall manner Proportionable to that of our fir&s;t Parents, they thought to have been Incorporate with the Gods: But in place of that, they were ju&s;tly Expelled Paradi&s;e, Lo&s;t their Sovereignty over the Creatures, and were forced to Earn their Bread with the Sweat of their Brows.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord Chancellor,</HI> I have heard a Propo&s;al, made from the other Side by the Marquis of <HI>Annandale;</HI> That, in place of Agreeing to this <HI>Second Article,</HI> where|in the Succe&s;&s;ion is to be Declared, as a Con&s;equence of our being United to <HI>England</HI> in one Kingdom, we &s;hould immediately go to Intail our Crown upon the Illu&s;trious Family of <HI>Hannover,</HI> upon &s;uch Conditions and Limitations as are in our own Power to make, for the Security of our Sacred and Civil Concerns. I think, This is the Import of what his Lord&s;hip gave in, by a Re&s;olve formerly, and hath told this Honourable Hou&s;e, That he thinks, he acts Con&s;equentially to his Former declared Principles, and that this is now the on|ly Mea&s;ure, which can &s;ettle and &s;ecure the Peace and Quiet of this Nation, and fix a firm Security for the Pro|te&s;tant Intere&s;t, and a perfect Under&s;tanding betwixt the two Nations.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o heard a Di&s;cour&s;e, by his Grace the Duke of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> &s;hewing, That ever &s;ince his Grace had the Honour to be a Member of this Honourable Hou&s;e; he had made it his Bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;erve the Sovereign and his Nation faithfully and hone&s;tly, without any By-Ends, By-Views, or Self-Intere&s;ts; That before the Affair of the Succe&s;&s;ion was Tabled in <HI>Scotland,</HI> he had endeavoured to promote the Intere&s;t of his Nation, by Good Laws, and by the be&s;t Coun&s;els he was capable to give, for rectifying Things ami&s;s, and advancing the &s;olid Intere&s;t of his Country; That &s;ince the Affair of the Succe&s;&s;ion came to be Con&s;idered, he could never give him&s;elf the Liberty to believe, but that previous to any Settlement, we ought to have had &s;uch Conde|&s;cen&s;ions
<PB N="66" REF="353">
with Relation to Trade and Commerce from <HI>England,</HI> as might Retrieve the Lo&s;&s;es the, Nation hath &s;u&s;tained from them, ever &s;ince the Union of the Two Crowns under one Sovereign; and that thereupon, to prevent all Faction and Party in the Treating of an Affair of &s;uch Importance, he had freely left the Nomination of the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners to Her Maje&s;ty, and wi&s;hes the Choice had been An&s;werable to his De&s;ign: But none can accu&s;e him as Bargaining for him&s;elf, &s;ince he has no Rea&s;on to Complain of the Breach of any Sti|pulation upon that Head; That now having Con&s;ider|ed the Articles of this Treaty lying before us, and the Fatal Con&s;equences that may follow upon the Fini&s;hing of an Incorporating Union with <HI>England,</HI> with the ge|neral <HI>Aver&s;ation</HI> that <HI>appears by the Addre&s;&s;es from the &s;everal Shires of the Kingdom,</HI> and particularly from <HI>the Addre&s;s of the Commi&s;&s;ion of the General A&s;&s;embly, and of the Royal Burrows of</HI> Scotland; he finds it nece&s;&s;ary to al|ter his Thoughts of that Matter, That he was none of the&s;e who loved to keep Things Loo&s;e and in Confu&s;ion; He had an E&s;tate in both Kingdoms, and therefore it was not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, he would make u&s;e only of a Treaty, to throw out the Succe&s;&s;ion one time; and of the Succe&s;|&s;ion, to throw off the Treaty another time. Therefore to prevent wor&s;e Con&s;equences, he is content, That in this Parliament, the Succe&s;&s;ion be Declared and Settled upon the Illu&s;trious Prince&s;s <HI>Sophia</HI> Electore&s;s of <HI>Hannover,</HI> and the Heirs of Her Body, upon &s;uch Conditions and Limi|tations as &s;hall be found nece&s;&s;ary by this Parliament, to &s;ecure our Civil Rights and Liberties, the Independency and Sovereignty of the Nation, &amp; the Presbyterian Govern|ment of this Church, as it is Founded upon the <HI>Claim of Right,</HI> and E&s;tabli&s;hed by Law, and who&s;e Privileges and Settlement he Re&s;olves to Support with the Outmo&s;t of his Power.</P>
<P>And therefore, his Grace thinks him&s;elf Obliged with all Humility in this pre&s;ent Juncture of Affairs, to Addre&s;s him&s;elf particularly to His Grace My Lord Com|mi&s;&s;ioner, and to beg of his Grace, That he would be plea&s;ed to acquaint Her Maje&s;ty with the True State of the Nation, and with the Propo&s;al made for Allaying the pre&s;ent Ferment and Settling a Solid Peace and Good Un|der&s;tanding betwixt Her Two Kingdoms, and that a &s;mall Rece&s;s may be granted in the mean time, till Her Maje|&s;ty's Gracious An&s;wer come, which, with all Submi&s;&s;ion, he conceives, will prevent the&s;e Bad Con&s;equences, that the further Pu&s;hing on of this Treaty may occa&s;ion. I think, <HI>My Lord,</HI> this is materially what his Grace &s;aid, tho' not &s;o fully nor &s;o well expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="354">
Now, <HI>My Lord,</HI> it remains, that I give Account of my &s;elf and of my own Opinion of this Affair: All who know me, <HI>My Lord,</HI> know that I have been from the beginning on a Revolution foot; I ventured my Life and Fortune with the Fir&s;t, and I have ever &s;ince acted Con&s;equentially to my Principle. It's true I was never a good Courtier under any Reign; becau&s;e I had a Rule for my Obedience, and never made Obedience my Rule; my Reputation was never &s;tained, Nor had I ever any Reproach laid upon me, &s;ave when I was brought in, Head over Ears, in a <HI>SCOTS</HI> PLOT, <HI>A Plot, very well known, de&s;ign'd to bla&s;t the Reputation of a Set of People, the be&s;t affected to the Sovereign, and to the true Intere&s;t of their Nation, that ever</HI> Scotland <HI>bred.</HI> What my Opinion was with Relation to the Succe&s;&s;ion is very well known al&s;o, I lookt upon Limitations with another Eye, than &s;ome others were plea&s;ed to do, I was far from Treat|ing them in Ridicule; Becau&s;e as all Human Affairs, they are lyable to Alterations, and might be taken off: that Argument proves too much, and Con|&s;equently proves nothing at all. Should a Man refu&s;e to have a good E&s;tate &s;ettled upon him, becau&s;e he may &s;quander it away, and become Bankrupt? Mu&s;t a Good Law be refu&s;ed, becau&s;e it may afterwards be Re|pealed? No, <HI>My Lord.</HI> Where the Power is lodged in our &s;elves, we have all Human Security Imaginable for the Thing; It is not &s;o, where the Power is lodged in others: therefore I &s;hall alwi&s;e Choo&s;e that Security, which depends upon my &s;elf, preferable to any other.</P>
<P>This, <HI>My Lord,</HI> hath Confirmed me, That Limitati|ons of our own making is the be&s;t Security; tho I alwi&s;e thought them not the Full, of what we merited, for the going into the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion. For Con&s;idering the Injuries, that we have received from them, we ought to have Reparation upon this Emergent: and I think with|out Incorporating with them, they might have given us &s;ome &s;mall Incouragement in our Trade with them, which would have been profitable unto us, and no man|ner of way prejudicial unto them, as I can clearly Demon|&s;trate, if there be Occa&s;ion for it: But &s;ince this is not the proper Place nor Sea&s;on for &s;uch Propo&s;als, I &s;hall go in with the Propo&s;al made by the Marquis of <HI>Annan|dale,</HI> and fortified by his Grace the Duke of <HI>Hamilton:</HI> becau&s;e I think, it is the be&s;t that we can make of it at this time, the fitte&s;t Mea&s;ure to prevent Civil Wars, allay the Ferment of the Nation, and far preferable to <HI>this In|corporating &V;nion,</HI> which <HI>as to us in all it's Clau&s;es</HI> ap|pears to be <HI>mo&s;t &V;nrea&s;onable.</HI></P></Q></P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="355">
This was a Politick Speech, there appeared &s;ome ill Nature in it, &amp; a great deal of Satyre upon the Union, but that was the Temper of the Times, and mu&s;t be pa&s;t over on that account; nor &s;hall I &s;ay any thing to it here, the Noble Per&s;on that made it, acquie&s;ced in the Union freely enough when it was made; as &s;hall appear in its place.</P>
<P>But I can not pa&s;s it over without ob&s;erving, That&mdash;this Speech gives Light into &s;everal Things; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It gives a hint at the Sugge&s;tion that had been made of D&mdash; <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> aiming at his own Title in all his former Oppo&s;iti|on made again&s;t the Succe&s;&s;ion, as well formerly as now, and clears that Noble Per&s;on from all &s;uppo&s;ition of &s;uch a thing, by his having offered now to come into the Succe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It gives a true &s;ight of the genuine Rea&s;on of all this &s;udden Complyance with the Succe&s;&s;ion, a Thing which had &s;omething very &s;urprizing in it, and which, &s;ome thought, mu&s;t have pre&s;ently carried abundance of People from the other Party, the De&s;ign being, as was afterward publickly own'd, <HI>if po&s;&s;ible, to Evade the pa&s;&s;ing this Article, as a Branch of the &V;nion.</HI> The Ca&s;e was, They were content with the Succe&s;&s;ion, as an Act of the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;ettled and E&s;tabli&s;hed in the Form, nece&s;&s;ary in that Ca&s;e; but they would not have the Succe&s;&s;ion brought upon them as the Con&s;equence of the Union.</P>
<P>And at la&s;t, they had this at the Bottom of it all, That if the Succe&s;&s;ion had been taken, <HI>as it was now offered,</HI> it mu&s;t have been taken in &s;tead of the Union, and that had an&s;we|red the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion, <HI>viz. Diverting the Grand Affair</HI> of the Union.</P>
<P>But they met with a double Di&s;appointment in this, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> As to offering the Succe&s;&s;ion in &s;tead of the Union, they came too late, &s;ince the Party who were for the Succe&s;&s;ion formerly with Limitations, were now come into the Union, as the be&s;t Scheme of Limitations they could ever hope to attain, and would not go back, finding the Union a better Scheme of Limitation than their own, becau&s;e it Entitled them to all the Limitations already &s;ettled in <HI>England,</HI> which they could not but allow, were more and better than any they had propo&s;ed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or than indeed they could expect to obtain.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> They were di&s;appointed in <HI>the way,</HI> for the <HI>Jacobites who held with them before</HI> in Oppo&s;ing the Union, <HI>broke with them here,</HI> &s;ince they found them&s;elves abandon'd by them in the main Article for which they oppo&s;ed the Uni|on, <HI>viz.</HI> The Tran&s;po&s;ing the Crown, as they called it, from the Son of the late King <HI>James;</HI> and if they were obliged to quite the Article of the Succe&s;&s;ion, the re&s;t was indifferent to them.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="356">
And therefore you find the Prote&s;t at the End of the Vote of this Day, was directly again&s;t the Union, tho' it was put <HI>in the u&s;ual Form,</HI> of the former Article of Limitations; &s;o the&s;e things did but increa&s;e the Divi&s;ion, and weaken the Party that Op|po&s;ed the Union, and by that means gave the more Room for tho&s;e who were for the Union, to carry it; And <HI>thus the Second Article pa&s;t,</HI> which concluded the Settlement of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion. And it was to be ob&s;erved, that the &s;ettling this Article was very &s;atisfactory to abundance of People, who were otherwi&s;e not very well reconciled to the Treaty, and gave a Handle to the Friends of the Union, to bring &s;ome People to a clearer &s;ight of their Intere&s;t, &s;ince they might &s;ee the Union was the readie&s;t way, <HI>and perhaps the only way,</HI> to obtain the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, and to &s;e|cure it upon the firme&s;t Foundation, and on the be&s;t Limi|tations, a Thing which had been long wi&s;h'd, and very much &s;truggled for before.</P>

<P>Moved al&s;o to proceed to the con&s;ideration of the fourth and other Articles of Union before the third.</P>
<P>And after &s;ome Rea&s;oning thereupon, it was put to the Vote, proceed to the Con&s;ideration of the third Article in the Terms of the above Motion relating thereto, or proceed to the fourth Ar|ticle; and it carried, proceed to the third.</P>
<P>And accordingly the Parliament proceeded to the con&s;ideration of the third Article; And after long Debate thereupon, a Vote was &s;tated, Approve of the third Article in the Terms of the above Motion relating thereto, <HI>yea</HI> or <HI>not.</HI></P>
<P>But before Voting, the Marque&s;s of <HI>Annandale</HI> gave in a Prote&s;t, upon the Foot of his former Re&s;olve pre&s;ented to this Hou&s;e, and contained in the Minute of the 4th of <HI>November</HI> in&s;tant, and craved that the Narrative thereof might be prefixed thereto, and which Narrative and Prote&s;t, is as follows, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q REND="inline">"Whereas it evidently appears, &s;ince the Printing, Publi&s;hing and Con&s;idering of the Ar|ticles of Treaty now before this Hou&s;e.

<P><Q REND="inline">"And &s;ince it is plain, that if an Union were agreed to in tho&s;e Terms by this Parliament, and accepted of by the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> it would in no &s;ort an&s;wer the peaceable and friendly ends propo&s;ed by an Union; But would on the contrair create &s;uch di&s;mal Di&s;tractions and Animo&s;ities among&s;t our &s;elves, and &s;uch Jealou&s;ies and Mi&s;takes betwixt us and our Neighbours, as would involve the&s;e Nations into fatal Breaches and Confu&s;ions.</Q></P>

<P>After Reading whereof, he took In&s;truments thereupon, and it was agreed, That, at calling the Rolls, the Adherers to the above Prote&s;t &s;hould be &s;o marked; And al&s;o, That the hail Members be marked as they &s;hall Vote, <HI>Approve</HI> or <HI>Not,</HI> and that a Li&s;t of their Names, as they &s;hall Vote <HI>Pro</HI> or <HI>Con,</HI> &s;hall be printed.

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXII.</HEAD>
<P>The Parliament were all this while Debating the Gene|rals of the Treaty, and therefore the Debates were al&s;o in general: The Work of this Day was not at all debating what Number of Members &s;hould be the Proportion of the Parliament, or how, or in what manner they &s;hould be cho|&s;en, and the like; but whether <HI>Britain,</HI> as now to be Unit|ed, &s;hould be Repre&s;ented by one and the &s;ame Parliament, yea or no.</P>
<P>The Debates were very long upon this Head; And as, in other Ca&s;es, it had, for &s;ome Days, taken up part of their Time, in Reading the long Addre&s;&s;es of Shires, Burghs and
<PB N="72" REF="359">
Pari&s;hes again&s;t the Union; &s;o, on this Day, there were &s;ome very particular ones re&s;erved, and which &s;eemed to be calculated for the Day, in which, according to the Popular Arguments of the Time, the Union was called a Surrendering the Sovereignty of <HI>Scotland</HI> to the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>I could never indeed &s;ee any Schemes offered, or learn that there was any &s;uch Propo&s;al, in what manner tho&s;e that were for re&s;erving the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> would have formed two &s;eparate Parliaments in an United Kingdom; &s;o that the Debates of this Day were not of what &s;hould be, but of what &s;hould not be; and the Uniting the Parliament was objected again&s;t, but without offering an Alternative of what they would have in the Room of it.</P>
<P>The principal Arguments made u&s;e of in this Days Debate were,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That Uniting the Parliament, was actually giving up the Con&s;titution of <HI>Scotland.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM> 2. That it was &s;ubjecting <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That it was dangerous to the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who&s;e Government was to be &s;ubjected to a Parliament of Epi&s;copal Members.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That it was contrary to the National Oath or Cove|nant.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>It is not my De&s;ign to make Arguments of my own, in order to an&s;wer them, or to make this Hi&s;tory a Di&s;pute, in&s;tead of a Relation of Fact&mdash;: But there having been &s;uch loud Clamours again&s;t the Union in general, and &s;uch violent Struggles again&s;t it in Parliament, it may not be in|con&s;i&s;tent with an Hi&s;tory, to relate the Foundation on either &s;ide which they acted upon, and as much of the Argument on both &s;ides, either <HI>within</HI> the Hou&s;e or <HI>without,</HI> as is u&s;eful to let the Reader into a true Under&s;tanding of the Tran&s;acti|ons of this Critical Time; and for this Rea&s;on I have divid|ed this Part into the Minutes and Ob&s;ervations, the one is perfectly Hi&s;torical, the other Explanatory of the Particulars, and I hope I need make no more Apology for the Method.<LIST>
<ITEM>1<HI>&s;t,</HI> It was alledged, That this Conjunction of Par|liaments was a giving up the Con&s;titution; Or, as it was frequently Worded in their printed Addre&s;&s;es, &s;ur|rendering the Sovereignty and Independency of <HI>Scot|land.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>It was an&s;wered, This was from a Defect in the com|mon Acceptation of the Word <HI>&V;NION,</HI> as it was now Treating of, and of its full Extent&mdash;of the Unions being <HI>CENTERAL</HI> and <HI>&V;NIVERSAL;</HI> in which it was alledged, That the Union now Treating of was, in the utmo&s;t po&s;&s;ible Meaning of the Word, comprehen|&s;ive of every Good to both; exclu&s;ive of all manner of Preference or Di&s;parity of Parts, abhorring all things In|jurious
<PB N="73" REF="360">
or Dimini&s;hing to either; a full Coalition, a general Incorporation of Nations, of Intere&s;ts, of Power, and of Safety:&mdash;A Samene&s;s of Circum&s;tan|ces and of Sympathies; becoming one and the &s;ame Body, with one and the &s;ame Head, Life, Soul, Nutri|ment, Point and Period; an Union of the very SOUL OF THE NATION, all its Con&s;titution, Cu&s;toms, Trade and Manners, mu&s;t be blended together, dige&s;t|ed and concocted, for the mutual United, Undi&s;tingui&s;h'd Good, Growth and Health of the one whole United Body; and that all the Sugge&s;tions of &s;ubjecting or &s;urrendering one part to another, were owing to the want of a right Conception, both of the Terms and of the Thing de&s;igned by the Term <HI>&V;NION.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>It was urged further, That this extended Signification of the Union excluded all po&s;&s;ibility of a Separation of Intere&s;ts, or Cla&s;hing of Properties, and that mutual Protection, mutual Increa&s;e, mutual Improvements were the Con&s;equences to be expected, not from this or that Circum&s;tance, Policy or Management, but from the Nature of the Thing.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>One may be &s;ure the&s;e things were warmly argued within Doors, when without, the People were in the utmo&s;t Fermen|tation, and the whole Nation &s;eemed as in an Agony, the Enemies of the Union went about Bemoaning <HI>Scotland,</HI> and Sighing, as they called it, for the Dying Con&s;titution, and a Noble Lord within, &s;tanding up to make a Speech on this Occa&s;ion, but being &s;top'd by the Order of the Day, &s;aid Mournfully, It was hard he could not be allowed to &s;peak one Word for their Dying Country&mdash;; The&s;e and the like Speeches had put the People in the la&s;t Degree of Concern.</P>
<P>The Capital Arguments made u&s;e of on this Occa&s;ion, and made Popular again&s;t the Uniting the Parliaments, were &s;uch as the&s;e,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That whatever Agreement is now concluded between the two Kingdoms, will never be binding to the New Parliament.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the two Kingdoms effectually &s;ubject them|&s;elves to the New Parliament, all the Conditions &s;tipu|lated on either &s;ide to the contrary in any wi&s;e notwith|&s;tanding.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>To this it was An&s;wered, That the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament were ab&s;olutely bound up by the Stipulations of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">reaty; that they being a &s;ub&s;equent Power to the two re&s;pective Parlia|ments of either Kingdom, had no other or further Power to act, than was Limited them by the Stipulations of both King|doms; That all &s;ub&s;equent Power is inferior in its Extent to the Power which it derives from; That the Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI> being the Creature of the Union, formed by ex|pre&s;s
<PB N="74" REF="361">
Stipulations between the two &s;eparate Parliaments of <HI>En|gland</HI> &amp; <HI>Scotland</HI> cannot but be unalterably bound by the Con|ditions &s;o &s;tipulated, and upon which it received its Beeing, Name and Authority: The Foundation of a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parlia|ment, is this Treaty; to &s;ay, They will <HI>not</HI> be bound by it, is to &s;ay, they will pull them&s;elves up by the Roots: they dye when the Union receives any mortal Wound; they cannot infringe one Article of the Union; they cannot put a Que&s;tion in the Hou&s;e upon any one Article.</P>
<P>As to the Objection, That there was a Surrender of So|vereignty and Con&s;titution, and delivering <HI>Scotland</HI> bound Hand and Foot into the ab&s;olute Di&s;po&s;e of the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>This was An&s;wered by way of Que&s;tion and An&s;wer, a|mong other Things, thus,</P>
<P>Q. <HI>What is it con&s;titutes the Parliament of</HI> Britain?</P>
<P>A. <HI>The &V;nion.</HI> Let any Man give another An&s;wer to it, if he can.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>How is it con&s;tituted?</HI></P>
<P>A. <HI>By Treaty</HI> between two Nations by their Heads and Repre&s;entatives, <HI>viz.</HI> the Queen and Parliament of each Kingdom.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>How do they bring it to pa&s;s?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By mutual altering their re&s;pective Con&s;titutions, and forming one general Con&s;titution upon a Treaty of Equalities and Equivalents; the Stipulations of which Trea|ty are agreed to by the Con&s;tituent Parts of the &s;ub&s;equent Body.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>&V;pon what Right doth the pre&s;ent re&s;pective Parliaments depend?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The Natural Right of the Free-holders of both King|doms, which entitles them by the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Lands, to have the free Exerci&s;e and Power of making the Laws by which they are to be governed.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>Does this new Con&s;titution de&s;troy that Right?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Not at all, but re&s;erving that Right, which indeed it cannot de&s;troy, agrees to limit the Exerci&s;e of it by &s;uch and &s;uch Forms, and on &s;uch and &s;uch Conditions, which Conditions are the Limitations of the Power of the new Par|liament, as being the Act and Deed of the old Parliaments, who&s;e Con&s;titution was founded on Original Right.</P>
<P>The next Popular Argument, &amp; which took up much of the Debates of this Day, was, That <HI>the Parliament had not a Power to it into this &V;nion;</HI> Or, as it was Worded in the publick Ad|dre&s;&s;es, <HI>That 'tis not in the Power of the</HI> Scots <HI>Government to con|clude &s;uch an &V;nion, without a manife&s;t Violation of Tru&s;t, and with|out doing a manife&s;t Act of Inju&s;tice, Oppre&s;&s;ion and &V;&s;urpation a|gain&s;t the Fundamental Rights and Liberties of this Free Kingdom;</HI> and this was the Sub&s;tance of mo&s;t of the Addre&s;&s;es pre&s;ent|ed to the Parliament.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="362">
This was An&s;wered by Enquiring into the Right Parlia|ments had to Le&s;&s;en, Enlarge, or Limit the Repre&s;entative; of which when the Number of Members comes to be Treated of.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Argument, and which indeed was made more u&s;e of without Doors than within, was the Danger to the Church Government of <HI>Scotland,</HI> by the Uniting the Repre&s;entative; in which it was argued,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament being chiefly Com|po&s;ed of Per&s;ons of another Communion, might, when ever they plea&s;ed, by a Majority of Votes overpowering the <HI>Scots,</HI> Overthrow their Church, introduce Epi&s;co|pacy, and reduce the Presbyterians to a Toleration, or perhaps wor&s;e.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That there being twenty &s;ix <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bi&s;hops &s;itting in the Hou&s;e of Peers, and who were by this Treaty to continue &s;itting there; this was &s;ubjecting <HI>Scotland</HI> in all its future Laws, to the &s;uffrage of Bi&s;hops, and by con&s;enting to the Treaty in which they were E&s;tabli&s;hed, it was Recognizing and E&s;tabli&s;hing Epi&s;copacy, which was to involve the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> in National Perjury, they being obliged by the National Covenant, never to &s;ubject them&s;elves to Epi&s;copacy, but to their power to Reform the Churches of both Kingdoms.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The&s;e Sugge&s;tions indeed had but too much Succe&s;s Abroad, and were the principal Subject of the &s;everal Ad|dre&s;&s;es, &s;ome of which the Reader may &s;ee in the Appendix, as a Sample of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The Arguments had their particular An&s;wers, too long to in&s;ert here, and are Touch'd in another part of this Work, the general An&s;wer is contained in the former Paragraphs, <HI>viz.</HI> the Obligation of the future Parliament to the exact Ob&s;ervation of the Treaty, in which the Security of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> was particularly provided for, and left Unalterable for ever&mdash;. A Security &s;o firm as the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> never enjoyed before from any Civil Government, or Humane Au|thority in the World.</P>
<P>As to the Objection about the Covenant, it was indeed mentioned in mo&s;t of the Addre&s;&s;es, but it was never menti|oned in Parliament at all; or at lea&s;t, not &s;o as to come to any Debate, or to put any Que&s;tion upon it; and therefore I refer it to its proper place.</P>
<P>There were &s;everal long Speeches made on this Article, &s;ome to &s;hew, that it was not in their power to Vote upon it at all, without Con&s;ulting Con&s;tituents, that the Parliament was a Fundamental of Government, and could not be &s;o much as altered, much le&s;s given up&mdash;, and that this Treaty was an entire Surrender of the Con&s;titution. It would take up too much Room in this Work, to repeat all the Argu|ments brought on this Head, or to in&s;ert the Speeches that were
<PB N="76" REF="363">
made much more to Collect the Arguments brought by way of An&s;wer&mdash;; But as the following Speech was made on this day, and &s;eems to be a full An&s;wer to the Main of the&s;e Ob|jections, I could not omit it, as it was &s;poken by a Gentle|man eminently concerned, both in the pre&s;ent Debate, and in the Treaty at <HI>London.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A Speech in Parliament &s;poken by Mr. <HI>Seton</HI> junior of <HI>Pitmedden</HI> <DATE><HI>November</HI> 18 1706,</DATE> upon the Subject of the third Article then being in Debate in the Hou&s;e.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord Chancellor,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Having heard with much Attention the third Ar|ticle Debated; I find it lyable with the other Articles of this Treaty, to be put in a fal&s;e or true Light by the Speakers to it, in proportion to tho&s;e Notions they have of the Nature of this Union: What I am to &s;ay con|cerning it, &s;hall be to remove &s;ome Objections, which in my Opinion is the proper Method to &s;mooth the way for approving it.</P>
<P>The principal Objections are; That the Repre&s;enta|tives for Shires and Burghs, cannot legally approve this Article, without the A&s;&s;ent of their Con&s;tituents; and that by the Approbation of it, the Sovereignty and In|dependency of this Kingdom, will be &s;urrendered to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> To give a di&s;tinct and convincing An&s;wer to the fir&s;t Objection, let us look a little to the Nature of our Con&s;titution of Government.</P>
<P>Our Government is not a <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Ari&s;tocracy, founded on <HI>Pacta Conventa,</HI> whereby all the Gentry are Im|powered in their particular Meetings, to pre&s;cribe Rules to their Repre&s;entatives in a General Dyet.</P>
<P>Our Government is not a common Democracy, where|by every Subject of <HI>Scotland</HI> may claim a Vote in the <HI>Legi&s;lature.</HI></P>
<P>Our Government is and has been many Ages pa&s;t, a Limited Monarchy, wherein the Sovereign and Re|pre&s;entative are the only Judges of every thing which does contribute to the Happine&s;s of the Body Politick, and from whom no Appeal can legally be made; and this De&s;cription is agreeable to Rea&s;on, to our Law, and to our Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on teaches us, that <HI>Anarchy</HI> is de&s;tructive to Mankind, and that no Society of People can be well
<PB N="77" REF="364">
Governed without a Supreme Power, who&s;e proceedings are only alterable by it &s;elf; <HI>Grotius</HI> &s;ays (L. 1. <HI>C.</HI> 3. &sect;. 7.) That we call the Supreme Power, who&s;e Acts are not &s;ubject to the Power of another.</P>
<P>Our Law is po&s;itive, that this Supreme Court is &s;ubject to no Humane Authority, <HI>Act</HI> 130. <HI>P.</HI> 8. <HI>J.</HI> 6. &amp; we learn from our Hi&s;tory, that the greate&s;t Alrerations have been made in the Con&s;titution of our Government, without Con&s;ulting the People: out of which I humbly offer a few Examples: In the Reign of <HI>Kenneth</HI> the 3d the Monarchy that Originally was Elective, became Heredi|tary: In the Reign of <HI>James</HI> 6th the Repre&s;entation of the Clergy in Parliament was re&s;tored: In the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> the 2d the Prerogative was exalted above its natural Level; and in the year 1698, the King was Dethroned, and the Clergy Expelled this Hou&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> I have heard a&s;&s;erted, that there are Fundamen|tals of Government which cannot be altered by this Hou&s;e, without the Con&s;ent of every <HI>Scot&s;man:</HI> But where were the&s;e &s;tipulated? Where are they Recorded? Were the&s;e made by our Forefathers at the fir&s;t In&s;titution of their Government, and have all &s;ucceeding Parliaments Sworn to their Ob&s;ervance? The&s;e Que&s;tions, Methinks, de&s;erve our Con&s;ideration, before it be a&s;&s;erted what is an unalterable Fundamental by this Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>As to the Arguments of Sir <HI>George Mackenzie,</HI> and other eminent Lawyers, brought upon the Stage to &s;up|port this Notion of Fundamentals; I think they require no particular An&s;wer, becau&s;e any Member who under|&s;tands the Nature of Government may &s;ee clearly, that the&s;e Arguments are founded on Roman Laws Cal|culated for People, as Members of private Societies, and not for perpetual Rules to the Supreme Power of any Nation.</P>
<P>In fine, I believe there are no Fundamentals of Go|vernment in any Nation, which are not alterable by its Supreme Power, when the Circum&s;tances of Times re|quire; and whoever is acquainted with Hi&s;tory may learn, that there are no People at pre&s;ent in <HI>Europe,</HI> which in different Ages have not &s;uffered variety of Changes in Government. I do indeed acknowledge, there are Fundamentals in Nature, to wit, Liberty and Property, which this Hou&s;e can never de&s;troy, without exceeding its outmo&s;t Bounds of Power, that are always limited to the Publick Good; Neverthele&s;s this Honourable Hou&s;e is only capable to Judge of the mo&s;t proper Means of &s;ecuring the&s;e Fundamentals: And for my part I &s;in|cerely believe that no judicious Man will &s;ay, There is the lea&s;t danger of our Liberty and Property by an Uni|on
<PB N="78" REF="365">
of Parliaments, when he Reflects that the People of <HI>England,</HI> have been in all Ages Noble A&s;&s;erters of the Rights of the Subject; have &s;pent much Blood and Trea|&s;ure in Defence of the Liberties of their Neighbours, and that after this Union, Encroachments on the Rights of the Subjects of any part of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> mu&s;t endanger the Liberty of the whole.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> I come now to the next Objection, That by the Approbation of this Article, we Surrender the So|vereignty and Independency of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>The&s;e words I acknowledge are very long, and may &s;ound Harmoniou&s;ly in the Ears of the Populace: for my part, I would be &s;orry ju&s;t now to have occa&s;ion to &s;ay, that in Fact, our Supremacy and Independency were Sur|rendered the day King <HI>James</HI> got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Throne, if at the &s;ame time I could not affirm, that the&s;e are again re&s;tored to us by this Treaty, which was managed with a Decorum &amp; Equality, that became two In|dependent and di&s;tinct Nations; and not after &s;uch a Clan|de&s;tine manner as was u&s;ed by Queen <HI>Mary</HI> &amp; the <HI>French,</HI> the 4th of <HI>April</HI> 1554, on which day our Sovereignty was indeed &s;urrendered, as may be &s;een in the <HI>Recueil de Traitez,</HI> &amp;c. P. 510.</P>
<P>But to put this Que&s;tion above Controver&s;ie, I con|ceive two ways only whereby a Free Nation lo&s;es its Sovereignty and Independency, which are Conque&s;t, and a voluntar Surrender of its Rights to another Nation, without any Re&s;ervation.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure no per&s;on in right Judgment will alledge, That this intended Union is a Conque&s;t; Nor can it be called a Surrender, &s;eeing the Treaty contains certain and di&s;tinct Re&s;ervations to both Kingdoms: Nor can I comprehend how either of two Nations, by an entire Union, &s;urrenders its Privileges: on the contrair, I agree with the learned <HI>Grotius</HI> (<HI>L.</HI> 2. <HI>C.</HI> 9. &sect;. 9&mdash;.) who's Opinion is, That the Rights and Privileges of two di&s;tinct Nations United, are con&s;olidated into one, by a mutual Communication of them.</P>
<P>Another Objection, <HI>My Lord,</HI> has been moved again&s;t this Article, which belongs more properly to the 22d Article, and that's concerning the Number of the Repre|&s;entatives from <HI>Scotland,</HI> to a Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> This Objection I'll endeavour to An&s;wer in as few words as the Nature of it will allow.</P>
<P>If both Nations are to be repre&s;ented by one Parlia|ment, there mu&s;t be Members from both Nations, and their Numbers mu&s;t be adju&s;ted by &s;ome Rule, which can be no other than that Fundamental in the Union of all Societies, whereby Suffrages are computed, to wit, the
<PB N="79" REF="366">
Proportion each Society contributes for the &s;upport of the whole: Now, the Union of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England</HI> is but the Union of two great Societies of People, into one Body Politick; So that we have nothing to direct our Forming a true Notion about the Number of the Repre&s;entative agreed to by this Treaty, on the part of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but the Proportion we are able to contribute for the &s;upport of the Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">nment of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and that has re&s;pect to the Numbers of our People, to the Extent of our Taxes, or to an Arithmetical proportion betwixt the&s;e, and tho&s;e of <HI>England;</HI> All which being duly con&s;idered, I may be bold to Affirm, that the Repre&s;entative agreed to by the Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> is more than falls to our Share.</P>
<P>Several Authors, who have wrote about the Nature of Society, or the Union of two or more Societies, a|gree to this Fundamental; and <HI>Grotius</HI> (<HI>L.</HI> 2. <HI>C.</HI> 5. &sect; 22.) has two Examples out of <HI>Strabo</HI> relating to it; One is, When <HI>Lybica</HI> United with Three Neighbouring Cities, It was &s;tipulated, That each of the Three was to have one Voice, but <HI>Lybica</HI> Two, becau&s;e it contri|buted much more to the common Benefite, than any of the re&s;t: The other Example is, That there were 23 Cities in <HI>Licia</HI> United, whereof &s;ome had three Voices, &s;ome two, and &s;ome but one.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> By the Repre&s;entative of Sixteen for the Nobility, there's no greater Hard&s;hip put upon them, than was put upon the &s;mall Barons in the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t, who then were of the &s;ame State with the Nobility, and &s;ubmitted to the Law for Conveni|ency.</P>
<P>By the Repre&s;entative of Fourty Five for the Commons, no prejudice is done to the State of Barons in re&s;pect of Repre&s;entation; for if they be Repre&s;ented from every Shire, or at lea&s;t from the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Shires, 'tis of no Import, whether every Shire be Repre&s;ented by one or more: And as to the State of Burrows, I'll pre|&s;ume to &s;ay, That the Retrenchment of their Repre|&s;entation is a Piece of Ju&s;tice done to this Nation, if Property or Taxes be the Rule of Repre&s;entation.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> So far have I endeavoured to An&s;wer the material Objections again&s;t this Article, not out of any Pro&s;pect to convince the Members again&s;t this Union, as to fortifie the Judgments of tho&s;e for it; And I wi&s;h heartily, That the Con&s;tituents for Shires and Burghs may have a true Confidence in their Repre&s;entatives, while they are Accompli&s;hing this Great and Noble Work of an Union of both Kingdoms, e&s;pecially con&s;i|dering, That they are bound by Oath to give their be&s;t
<PB N="80" REF="367">
Advices and Suffrages; That they were cho&s;en by them&s;elves in a free Election; That they have their Families and E&s;tates among 'em; That the &s;ame Li|berty, Property and Religion are common to 'em both; And that the Good or Bad Con&s;equences of this Uni|on, mu&s;t equally affect Repre&s;entatives and Con&s;titu|ents.</P>

<P><HI>THIS SPEECH</HI> was received with great Satisfaction and Applau&s;e, and the Arguments in it were &s;o clear, e&s;pecially as to the Proportions of the Repre&s;entative, that it was very u&s;eful, when that Head came to be debated; and I cannot but think the Reader will think his Time well be&s;towed in Reading it, in that he will &s;ee by it, whether the Union was carryed by Strength of Rea&s;oning, or, as &s;ome alledged, cram'd down their Throats by meer Number of Voices.</P>
<P>The Debates held very long, but at length the Que&s;tion being propo&s;ed, the Vote was carried with the u&s;ual <HI>Provi|&s;o, viz. That it be of no Force if all be not Concluded;</HI> and the di&s;&s;enting Members prote&s;ted, as you will &s;ee in the Minutes. And &s;o this mighty Ca&s;e was al&s;o Determined.</P>

<P>The Lord Chancellor acquainted the Parliament, that la&s;t Night his Grace Her Maje&s;ties High Commi&s;&s;ioner, in his Return to the Palace, was In&s;ulted by a Number of People of the meane&s;t Degree with Stones, which was an high Affront both to Her Maje&s;ties High Commi&s;&s;ioner, and to the Parliament; And therefore moved, that the Parliament may give the nece&s;&s;ary Orders, not only to find out &s;uch as have been guilty as Actors or Abettors therein, but to pre|vent the like in time coming; and after &s;ome Rea&s;oning on the &s;aid Repre&s;entation and Motion:</P>
<P>It was agreed, to Remit to the Committee Nominate for Examin|ing the Calculation of the Equivalent, to enquire into the Matter of this In&s;ult; And to endeavour to find out the Actors and Abettors, if any be, with Power to the &s;aid Committee to promi&s;e Indemnities and Rewards for Di&s;coveries, and to Seize and Impri&s;on any Per&s;on whom they &s;hall have ground to &s;u&s;pect to be guilty, as Actors or Abet|tors, &amp; to call for the Magi&s;trates &amp; Neighbours of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> for In|formation, and to Report to the Parliament, what Information and Di&s;covery they &s;hall make of the &s;aid In&s;ult, or of any former. As

al&s;o, to Report their Opinion, what Mea&s;ures may be proper for preventing the like in time coming, and the Committee appointed to meet the fir&s;t Interval Day of Parliament at nine of the Clock.</P>
<P>The Parliament did likeways Recommend to the Lord High Con|&s;table to pro&s;ecute forthwith the&s;e Per&s;ons, who were Impri&s;oned on Account of a former Tumult, and ordained the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> to furni&s;h what Probation they can, to the Fi&s;cal of the Con&s;tables Court, again&s;t &s;uch as were &s;o Impri&s;oned.</P>

<P>Thereafter it was moved. That the Parliament proceed to the Fourth Article of Union.</P>
<P>Moved al&s;o, That, before proceeding to the Con&s;ideration of the Fourth Article, a Clau&s;e be added to the Third Article in thir Terms, <HI>And that the &s;aid Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>&s;hall meet and &s;it once in Three Years at lea&s;t, in that Part of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>now called</HI> Scotland.</P>
<P>And after &s;ome Debate thereupon, the Con&s;ideration of the &s;aid Additional Clau&s;e delayed, till the Parliament come to the Twenty Second Article.</P>
<P>Then the Fourth Article of Union was Read, and after &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e thereupon, the further Con&s;ideration thereof was delayed till the next <HI>Sederunt</HI> of Parliament, and the Con&s;ideration thereof to be then re&s;umed previous to all other Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>The Affairs of Tumult and Clamour from the Street, I have related in its proper place; yet, as far as it came to be con|&s;idered in Parliament, I mu&s;t take notice of it here, but &s;hall be the briefer, referring to what is &s;aid el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Rabble had been cru&s;h'd for &s;ome time, <HI>as has been ob&s;erved already,</HI> and the Vigilance of the Government had &s;ecured the Parliament hitherto; But the Inveterate Fu|ry of the poor ignorant People, impo&s;ed upon by the Popu|lar Arguments of the Times, and the&s;e enlarged upon by the various Pamphlets and Speeches again&s;t the Union, which were &s;pread among&s;t them, was very hard to be re&s;trained.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Queensberry,</HI> the Queens High Commi&s;&s;ioner, received divers Affronts in his going to and from the Parlia|ment, tho' his Grace did not think worth his while to trouble the Parliament with it, while it was any thing tolerable; But it was now grown to that Height, That not only the Commi&s;&s;ioners Life was in Danger, but the Publick Peace &s;eemed manife&s;tly aimed at, and it was very nece&s;&s;ary to put a Check to &s;uch In&s;ults, le&s;t the whole might be endangered.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="369">
The High Commi&s;&s;ioner had received &s;everal private Intimations of De&s;igns to a&s;&s;a&s;inate him, and &s;everal Letters, &s;ome abu&s;ive and threatning, others pretending to give him Caution to pre&s;erve his Per&s;on, others directly pretending to inform of the De&s;igns, the Time when, Manner how, and Weapons by which he was to be Murdered; whether the&s;e were real De&s;igns, or only Attempts to amu&s;e, and perhaps di&s;courage his Grace in the Di&s;charge of his Duty in &s;o weighty a Work, was, I believe, never certainly known: But whoever will calmly con&s;ider the Temper of the People at that time, how inflamed by the Artifice of a Party, and how frequently they &s;hew'd their Readine&s;s to have undertaken any Thing, tho' never &s;o de&s;perate, to have broken off this Affair, will wonder, That no Agent of Satan was found hardned enough to have committed that, or any like &s;ort of Villany.</P>
<P>Nor did it &s;eem that there was any thing wanting, but the meer Courage to venture their Lives in &s;uch a Bloody Action, &s;ince, in the Occa&s;ion which was now brought be|fore the Hou&s;e, it appeared there were Stones thrown at the Commi&s;&s;ioners Coach from the Tops of Hou&s;es, &s;ufficient to have Murdered him, if Providence had not more e&s;pecially protected both his Per&s;on, and the Affair in Hand; which, had any &s;uch Villany been perpetrated, would, mo&s;t certainly, have all been lo&s;t in the nece&s;&s;ary Confu&s;ions that mu&s;t have followed.</P>
<P>For the Readers particular Information of the Temper and Humour of the People at that time, &s;ome of the Threatning Letters &s;ent to his Grace the High Commi&s;&s;ioner, are Printed in the Appendix N. <HI>G xx.</HI> faithfully Tran&s;cribed from the Original.</P>
<P>As to the manner of the pre&s;ent In&s;ult offered the Com|mi&s;&s;ioner&mdash;, it was thus, Opportunity was taken, upon the length of the Debates that Day, which keeping the Hou&s;e late&mdash;, and the Lord Commi&s;&s;ioner being to pa&s;s the Streets in the Night, the whole length of the City from the Parliament Hou&s;e to the Palace, the Mob took the opportunity of the Darkne&s;s, a Time proper for &s;uch Villanies; Fir&s;t they affronted the Guards, and followed them with Cur&s;es and Opprobri|ous Words, and their Numbers increa&s;ing as they went on, they began to throw Stones at them, which occa&s;ioned &s;ome little Di&s;order among the Hor&s;es, and this at la&s;t encrea&s;ed to the throwing Stones at the Commi&s;&s;ioner him&s;elf, one of which narrowly mi&s;s'd his Per&s;on.</P>
<P>The Coachman and Po&s;tilion, whether <HI>frighted them&s;elves,</HI> or that the Hor&s;es were unruly, drove a little fa&s;ter than u&s;ual down the Street, which put the Guards to a full Trot; and that heartening the Rabble, as if the Guards had fled from them, they Shouted and continued pur&s;uing them with
<PB N="83" REF="370">
Dirt, Stones, and &s;uch &s;ort of Violence, till they came to the Palace, where the Foot Guards received them, and kept off the Croud.</P>
<P>Every Body will allow, that con&s;iders the&s;e Circum&s;tances, which I was an Eye Witne&s;s to, That it was time to put a Stop to this Violence, and to re&s;train a Head-&s;trong Multi|tude thus made Bold and Furious, le&s;t they &s;hould, <HI>as in &s;uch Ca&s;es is not uncommon,</HI> run on to more violent Extremes; and therefore the Lord Commi&s;&s;ioner ordered the Lord Chan|cellor to Repre&s;ent it to the Hou&s;e, as in the Vote.</P>
<P>The Motion for the Parliament &s;itting once in Three Years was needle&s;s, for that indeed it was &s;ettled in the Twenty Second Article for the Fir&s;t Parliament, and e&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>England</HI> by other Laws made there, which were to continue in Force by the Treaty.</P>

<P>The Fourth Article of Union again Read.</P>
<P>Whereupon it was moved to take the &s;everal Branches of Trade, to be communicate, into Con&s;ideration, that it may thereby appear how far the Communication of Trade &s;hall be advantageous; And after Rea&s;oning thereupon.</P>
<P>The Vote was &s;tated, Approve of the Fourth Article, Re&s;erving the Con&s;ideration of the &s;everal Branches of Trade, till the Parlia|ment come to the &s;ub&s;equent Articles, <HI>yea</HI> or <HI>not.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXIV.</HEAD>
<P>This Article being General, but containing &s;everal Parti|culars, it was judged proper to pa&s;s it in the gro&s;s fir&s;t, with a Re&s;erve for &s;uch Clau&s;es and Branches of Trade, as &s;hould come into Con&s;ideration afterward; for otherwi&s;e the&s;e Branches of Trade would have been foreclo&s;ed, by agreeing to this Article in the full Extent of the Words.</P>
<P>The&s;e Branches came all to be Con&s;idered in the Debating other Articles, as particularly, when they came to Examine the Affairs of Drawbacks, Bounties on Exportation, Prohibi|tions, and Re&s;trictions in Trade, the &s;everal Cu&s;toms, Duties, Equalities and Proportions of Trade; Of which in their Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>This Re&s;erve, however, made the Article it &s;elf pa&s;s the more readily at this Time, for it was the fir&s;t Article after Voting the Generals, that was Branched out into Particulars, and therefore the Adjourning the&s;e Particulars was the more acceptable.</P>
<P>The Debate of the Fifth Article lay only here, the Treaters had Debated about the Time limited for allowing the Ships then in the Hands of the <HI>Scots,</HI> to be free Ships, the <HI>Scots</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners would have had it been the Time of Ratify|ing the Union; The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners in&s;i&s;ted on it, that it &s;hould be the Time of Signing the Treaty; and the Rea&s;ons were good, that otherwi&s;e People might buy multitudes of Foreign Ships, and have time to furni&s;h them&s;elves, and pa&s;s the&s;e Foreign Built Ships as free Bottoms, in the Terms of the Act of Navigation, to the infinite Damage of the whole I&s;land; And this had the more Force with it, in that it could not but be allowed, that it was the great Advantage of this whole I&s;land, to encourage the Building, and con&s;equently the Employing our own Ships&mdash;. However, many popular Arguments were u&s;ed to lengthen out the Time, &s;uch as, That <HI>Scotland</HI> was not yet in a Condition to Build, and that this would check her Trade, to leave her naked of Ships till &s;he could furni&s;h her &s;elf with Materials for Building; that for
<PB N="85" REF="372">
the Fi&s;hing and Ea&s;t-Country Trade, it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary to furni&s;h Foreign Built Ships, till <HI>Scotland</HI> could Build for her &s;elf.</P>
<P>It was alledged, <HI>England</HI> could furni&s;h Ships, and it was &s;o material a Thing to Encourage the Building, and Increa&s;e of our own Shipping, that <HI>England</HI> would in&s;i&s;t upon it, and had rea&s;on &s;o to do.</P>
<P>However, after long Debating, it was agreed, to lengthen the Term to the Ratifying the Treaty; and this was the fir&s;t Alteration made in the Articles&mdash;; But it was referred to the next day.</P>

<P>The Debate about the admitting the <HI>Scots</HI> Ships as free Bottoms, was now rea&s;&s;umed, and the Time limited for the Properties to be made out, was altered from the Time of Signing the Articles, to the Time of Ratifying the Treaty.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Di&s;pute was, Whether it &s;hould be the Time of Ratifying the Treaty in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or the Ratification in both Kingdoms&mdash;, this Article was Di&s;puted by Inches, and &s;ome thought, there was more Nicety u&s;ed here, than was of any Signification; and that therefore it &s;eem'd the effect of a Ge|neral Struggle again&s;t the Union, where every thing was laid hold on, that either might bring on &s;ome Alteration they thought <HI>England</HI> could not comply with, or that at lea&s;t might but cau&s;e a Di&s;pute in <HI>England,</HI> or that might &s;o gain
<PB N="87" REF="374">
time, as to avoid having the thing Compleated in the then &s;itting Parliament.</P>
<P>It was well known, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would be very tender of their Act of Navigation, which is the Security of their Trade, and the main Encourager of their Shipping, and the longer this Liberty of purcha&s;ing Ships from the <HI>Dutch</HI> was extend|ed, the more Room there would be for Exceptions in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> their Trade being the more expo&s;ed to the bringing in Foreign Bottoms among them.</P>
<P>And if it be true, as I have &s;een a Minute made of it in Writing&mdash;, That the Party had prepared Schemes of Ob|jections to be offered in the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> again&s;t the very Alterations which they them&s;elves had procured to be made in <HI>Scotland;</HI> If this be true, it will abundantly ju&s;tifie the general Suppo&s;ition I have &s;o often hinted at, <HI>viz.</HI> That the&s;e Objections were rather calculated to delay the Treaty, and overthrow the Union it &s;elf, than from any particular Regard had to the Rea&s;on and Nature of the Thing objected.</P>
<P>Nothing el&s;e could be the Occa&s;ion of &s;uch &s;trong Struggles for things in them&s;elves not of any great Advantage to <HI>Scot|land,</HI> as in this Ca&s;e of the Ships, of which, it may be noted, That, after that Matter was &s;ettled, it was hardly known, that one Ship was bought, either in <HI>Scotland</HI> or <HI>England,</HI> with the De&s;ign of making it Free, as was &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P>However, after long Debate, the middle Cour&s;e was taken, and the Time was extended from the Time of Signing the Articles, as it was Agreed in <HI>London,</HI> to the Time of Ratification in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI>&mdash;, but not to the Time of Ratification in both Parliaments, as was pro|po&s;ed.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Propo&s;al again&s;t Pre&s;&s;ing of Seamen, was a mani|fe&s;t Attempt of the kind above mentioned, and a &s;eeking an Occa&s;ion to interrupt the main Treaty, &s;ince no Body could imagine, That &s;uch a Clau&s;e could have pa&s;&s;ed in <HI>England,</HI> all their own Seamen having been lyable to be pre&s;s'd into the Service of the Navy; And both Nations being to enjoy equal Privileges, this had been to put &s;uch a Di&s;advantage, and &s;uch Inequalities upon the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as would have made ju&s;t Complaints in <HI>England,</HI> and have been a &s;ufficient Ob|&s;tacle to the whole, e&s;pecially when it was remembred, that in <HI>Scotland</HI> there was no want of Seamen, but that on the contrary many Thou&s;ands of their Seamen, for want of Em|ployment, entered them&s;elves on Board the Men of War in Foreign Service, with the <HI>Danes, Swedes,</HI> and <HI>Hollanders;</HI> And it would be hard, That they &s;hould &s;eek a Liberty from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Service, which would now be their own; and at the &s;ame time, for want of Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;eek Service among Foreigners; it being alledged, That, at this time, there were
<PB N="88" REF="375">
16000 <HI>Scots</HI> Sailers in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Service&mdash;; This was &s;o plain a Ca&s;e, that the Propo&s;al was rejected, and the Ar|ticle Pa&s;s'd with only the fir&s;t Amendment.</P>
<P>And this was the &s;econd Alteration in the Articles of the Union.</P>

<P>Which being Read and Di&s;cour&s;ed upon, There was another Propo&s;al given in, for Enlarging and Explaining the &s;aid Sixth Article in the&s;e Terms, viz. <HI>And &s;eing by the Laws of</HI> England <HI>now &s;tanding, there are Rewards granted upon the Exportation of certain kinds of Grain, wherein Oats is not &s;pecified, That, from and after the &V;ni|on, when Oats &s;hall be at Fifteen Shillings</HI> per <HI>Quarter, or under, There &s;hall be paid Two Shillings and Six Pence for every Quarter of Oat Meal Exported in the Terms of the Laws, whereby Rewards are granted for Exportation of other Grains.

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>The Sixth Article of Cour&s;e began the Debates about Al|lowances, Drawbacks, Prohibitions and Re&s;trictions, which, as has been ob&s;erved, were to be equal to all the Subjects&mdash;; But <HI>Scotland</HI> finding &s;ome Difference in the Value and Frequency of Import or Export of Grain, they found a Nece&s;&s;ity to come into &s;ome Amendments here too: The Ca&s;e was thus,</P>
<P><HI>England</HI> allowed a Bounty to the Exporter of Corn at all times, when the Plenty of Grain kept the Price under &s;uch a &s;tated Rate; But it was ob&s;erved there was no Bounty on the Exportation of Oats, the Rea&s;on was, becau&s;e <HI>England</HI> rather wanted Oats than had them to &s;pare, one Sea&s;on with another.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, <HI>Scotland</HI> producing va&s;t Quantities of Oats, and having a large Trade for the Exporting the &s;ame to <HI>Norway,</HI> and other Parts, the <HI>Scots</HI> Members in&s;i&s;ted,
<PB N="90" REF="377">
That a Drawback &s;hould be allowed on Oats and Oat Meal Exported.</P>
<P>Another Ca&s;e al&s;o required an Alteration, and this re&s;pect|ed <HI>Ireland,</HI> which Bordering on <HI>Scotland,</HI> could and might ea&s;ily throw in great Quantities of Oats or Oat Meal into <HI>Scotland,</HI> which being cheap in <HI>Ireland,</HI> would le&s;&s;en the Con&s;umption of the Growth of <HI>Scotland;</HI> There was, it &s;eems, a Prohibition formerly laid on the Importation of Oats or Oat Meal, but this being taken off by the Union, it was requi&s;ite to make &s;ome Provi&s;ion, where the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Laws was defective, which was thus,</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had, by Act of Parliament, a Duty of Five Shillings Six Pence <HI>per</HI> Quarter laid upon all Oats Import|ed, and that they thought was &s;ufficient; But there being no more Duty on Oat Meal than on Oats, it was alledged, That the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> might Import the Oat Meal, and afford to pay the Duty, &s;ince it was not above half the Value of the Duty of Oats, the Value of the Meal reducing the Du|ty.</P>
<P>This therefore was provided again&s;t by this Additional Clau&s;e, which doubled the Duty upon Oat Meal Imported, by reckoning every Quarter of Oat Meal as two Quarters of Oats.</P>
<P>The Acts in Favours of the re&s;pective Burghs were in order to continue to them the &s;everal Impo&s;itions on Ale and Wine cu&s;tomary in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or granting them anew, being gene|rally granted for the publick U&s;es of the Towns, &s;uch as build|ing or maintaining publick Edifices, Harbours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Ju&s;t as has been practi&s;ed in <HI>England</HI> in the Duties on Coals, as at <HI>London</HI> for building the Churches, at <HI>Yarmouth</HI> for their Pier; or on Ships, as at <HI>Dover</HI> for the Repair of their Harbour, and the like: And this being the la&s;t Parliament to &s;it in <HI>Scotland,</HI> if the Union &s;ucceeded, and all private Rights be|ing made perpetual, or to continue to the Times they were Entailed for, this made the Towns the more &s;olicitous to have Acts pa&s;&s;ed in their Favours at this time; The Exci&s;e upon Liquors, <HI>payable to private Hands,</HI> indeed was a No|velty in <HI>England,</HI> and &s;eemed to be a very odd Re|que&s;t at this time, That while, on one Hand, they &s;hould be pleading, that <HI>Scotland</HI> could not pay more Exci&s;e on their Liquor than they did before, at the &s;ame time they &s;hould, on the other Hand, be &s;eeking an Additional Duty to be paid to the Burghs&mdash;; But the Duty being &s;o &s;mall as two Pennies <HI>Scots,</HI> which is but &frac16; of a Penny on the Pint <HI>Scots,</HI> which is two Quarts <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> it was generally agreed to, and principally forth at it was not extended all over the Kingdom, but only in the few Towns, that having publick Trade to &s;upport, and chargeable

<P>The Sixth Article of Union again Read, and a Propo&s;al given in for adding the Word <HI>(Drawbacks)</HI> to both Clau&s;es of the &s;aid Ar|ticle, which was agreed to.</P>
<P>And the &s;aid Article as &s;o amended was again Read, as al&s;o the Propo&s;al mentioned in the Minutes of the la&s;t <HI>Sederunt,</HI> in relation to Oats and Oat-Meal, with the Addition of a further Clau&s;e, in the&s;e Terms, <HI>And that the Beer of</HI> Scotland <HI>have the like Rewards and Draw|backs as Barley.</HI></P>

<P>Thereafter there was a Clau&s;e offered to be added to the &s;aid &s;ixth Article in the&s;e Terms, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q REND="inline">"But <HI>Scotland</HI> for the &s;pace of &leftblank; years after the fir&s;t Day of <HI>May</HI> next, &s;hall be free from, and no ways &s;ubject to the Prohibition and Re&s;trictions made again&s;t Exporting of Wooll, Skins with Wooll upon them, and Woollen Yarn, which by the Oaths of the Sellers and Buyers &s;hall be made appear to be the proper growth and product of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and Spun within the &s;ame, which &s;hall no ways be comprehended under any of the Laws already made in <HI>England,</HI> or to be made during the &s;pace fore|&s;aid.</Q></P>

<P>And likeways another Clau&s;e in the&s;e Terms, <Q REND="inline">"That from and after the Union all Duties or Bounty Tolls, or other Exactions upon black Cattle, or any other Product of <HI>Scotland,</HI> when carried into <HI>England,</HI> or Product of <HI>England</HI> when carried into <HI>Scotland,</HI> payable either to the publick or private Per&s;ons, &s;hall in all time coming be void and null.</Q></P>
<P>And another Clau&s;e in the&s;e Terms, <Q REND="inline">"That from and after the Union, the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hall have Liberty for ever to Manufacture Plaiding, Fingrams, Galloway-whites, Sarges, Stock|ings, and all &s;orts of Lining, as they have been in u&s;e to do, con|form to the Regulations contained in their own Laws, and to Ex|port the &s;ame to <HI>England</HI> or Dominions and Plantations thereto belonging, or to any other Place beyond Seas, free of any Duty or Impo&s;ition what&s;omever to be laid thereon, but in ca&s;e any of the Subjects of that part of United <HI>Britain</HI> now called <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;hall Export any other &s;ort of Woollen Manufactory than what is above-mentioned, They are to be lyable to the Regulations and Taxes of <HI>England</HI> impo&s;ed before the Union, or to be impo&s;ed by the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament after the Union.</Q></P>

<P>The Ob&s;ervations upon this days Minutes, will be more properly referred to the time when the Committee to whom the &s;ixth Article was referred, make their Report.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="380">
The Amendment of <HI>(Drawbacks)</HI> was not &s;crupled, it was included before in the word <HI>Allowances,</HI> but it was &s;uch a Triffle, that no Body would Di&s;pute it, &s;eing it contained nothing but what was intended in the Article it &s;elf.</P>
<P>The Amendments offered were many, and the refering them to a Committee was, <HI>no Que&s;tion,</HI> the be&s;t Method to come to a Settlement in the &s;everal Particulars; but this may be ob&s;erved, and it was remarkable, that &s;uch was the Igno|rance of the Objectors in the&s;e Ca&s;es, and &s;o much had they been impo&s;ed upon in Matters of Trade, that they De|manded incon&s;i&s;tent and impracticable Things, they deman|ded Exemption from Impo&s;ts which no Body paid, they De|manded Liberty where there were no Prohibitions, and Equa|lities which were already agreed to.</P>
<P>For Example, Liberty of Exporting Wooll, a Thing on which the whole <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commerce depended, and without a Re&s;traint upon which, all their Manufactures would have been Ruin'd, a Thing Impracticable in the Nature of their Trade, and which it was incon&s;i&s;tent with Rea&s;on to expect.</P>
<P>Then they required Liberty of Exporting Linen Duty free, whereas it was evident, had they con&s;ulted the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Affairs, they would have found, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> gave that Liberty to all the World; And if any Linen was Imported into <HI>England,</HI> what|ever Duty it paid there, was allowed back again, upon Ex|portation by Certificate.</P>
<P>Next, They demanded Liberty to Export their Woollen Goods free of all Duties and Cu&s;toms, whereas it was known, <HI>England</HI> had, long &s;ince, taken off all Duty or Cu&s;tom upon their Woollen Manufactures for &s;everal Rea&s;ons of Trade, and for the Encouragement of the Poor.</P>
<P>Again they asked Freedom of carrying their Goods &amp; Cattel into <HI>England</HI> without Cu&s;toms and Toll, which it was evident, without any Provi&s;ion, was the Con&s;equence of the Union; And there could no more remain any Toll, Cu&s;tom or Duty, on Pa&s;&s;ing and Repa&s;&s;ing of Cattel or Goods between <HI>Eng|land</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> than there could in either Kingdom, from one County to another.</P>
<P>But this will further appear, when the Report of the Committee comes to be under Con&s;ideration.</P>

<P>On the other Hand, others pretended to bring all the Ale Brewed then in <HI>Scotland</HI> down to the Denomination of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;mall Beer, as being not &s;old for more than &s;ome of the Table Beer in <HI>England</HI> was &s;old for, which paid but as &s;mall Beer after the Rate of One Shilling Three Pence <HI>per</HI> Barrel.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be very far from offering to make any part of this Hi&s;tory Officious, in giving an Account of any mean Share the Author had in this Affair, yet I cannot omit relating this part of the Concern which ca&s;ually happened to him in this particular; And it may be mentioned for the &s;ake of the Je&s;t it made in the Town, <HI>viz.</HI> That while it was thought well done to have a Share in &s;tating the Proportions of the Exci&s;e, &s;everal Per&s;ons pretended to the Title of being the fir&s;t Contrivers of it; but when afterwards, on &s;ome Cla|mour rai&s;ed upon the Inequality of the Proportions, the Con|trivers began to be blamed, and a little threatned <HI>a-la-Mob,</HI> then it was <HI>D. F.</HI> made it all, and he was to be Stoned for it; And afterward, when tho&s;e Differences appearing but Trifles, were by the Prudence of the Commi&s;&s;ioner reconciled, then they would willingly have rea&s;&s;umed the Honour of be|ing the fir&s;t Formers of this Affair.</P>
<P>It was indeed no &s;mall Difficulty at fir&s;t, how to &s;tate a <HI>Medium</HI> between the two Nations; It had been laid down as a Maxim, <HI>That</HI> Scotland <HI>could, by no means, bear the high Exci&s;es paid for their &s;trong Beer in</HI> England; It was al&s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to regard doing Ju&s;tice to <HI>England,</HI> who, paying Four Shillings Nine Pence <HI>per</HI> Barrel Exci&s;e, would have had a great Hard&s;hip, if <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould have had all their Beer as <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;mall Beer.</P>
<P>Again, the <HI>Scots</HI> Ale which was &s;old in the Publick Hou&s;es, and commonly called <HI>TIPPONY,</HI> was in no Proportion like the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;trong Beer, either in Price or in Strength, being fold for one Penny the <HI>Chappin,</HI> which was near the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Quart, by Retail, after paying a &s;ub&s;equent Exci&s;e to the Cities or Burghs, and not one Half, or above one Third as &s;trong as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ale or &s;trong Beer. Upon this I &s;hall impartially &s;et down the Matter of Fact.</P>
<P>The Author of this being &s;ent for by the Committee of Parliament then &s;itting, <HI>the &s;ame to whom the Sixth Article was committed, as is above &s;aid,</HI> attended them at their Meet|ing in the Lord <HI>Ce&s;nock</HI>'s Chamber; And being called in,
<PB N="96" REF="383">
the Committee did him the Honour to tell him, they were informed he had &s;pent &s;ome Thoughts on the Affair of the Exci&s;es, and that he had made &s;ome Calculations; They told him, the Parliament were coming upon the Debate of the Seventh Article, and the great Difficulty before them was, to find out a <HI>Medium</HI> between the <HI>Scots</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ex|ci&s;e, &s;o as might make it tolerable to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and not give <HI>England</HI> Rea&s;on to take Umbrage, or complain of Inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>He frankly owned, he thought it would be very hard, and propo&s;ed what he had formerly in&s;i&s;ted on, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Scots</HI> Ale or Tippony being &s;old for no more Money, than the Hou&s;hold or Table Beer in the City of <HI>London,</HI> which is called Eight Shilling Beer, and is often &s;old for Ten Shillings <HI>per</HI> Barrel, the <HI>Scots</HI> ought al&s;o to pay no more.</P>
<P>But the Lord Pre&s;ident of the Se&s;&s;ion objected, That the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would never be &s;atisfied with that Payment, as not being a ju&s;t Proportion; That the Act of Parliament was expre&s;s, That all Beer above the Price of Six Shillings <HI>per</HI> Barrel &s;hould pay as &s;trong Beer; That tho&s;e kinds of Beer, called Eight Shil|ling Beer, were generally Mixtures after the Exci&s;e was paid; and that the Denomination in <HI>England</HI> being but of two kinds, it would not be po&s;&s;ible to place this on either Head, and to leave it to the Method of the Eight Shilling Beer in <HI>London,</HI> would be to lay all <HI>Scotland</HI> at the Mercy of the Ex|ci&s;e Officers, which would be un&s;ufferable.</P>
<P>This Di&s;cour&s;e put a Thought in the Authors Head ju&s;t in the Moment, upon which he told their Lord&s;hips, he thought a Proportion to both Sides might be formed, taking its Ri&s;e from the Price of the Beer, and Value of the Exci&s;e in either Kingdom, and that he thought, he could form it for them, &s;o as that it &s;hould not grieve either Party.</P>
<P>Upon which their Lord&s;hips de&s;ired him to try, he took the Pen and Ink, and immediately &s;tated the Ca&s;e thus,</P>
<P>There are in <HI>England</HI> but two Denominations of Exci&s;e|able Beer, &s;mall and &s;trong.</P>
<P>The &s;mall was &s;uppo&s;ed in the Act at Six Shillings <HI>per</HI> Barrel, and payed One Shilling Three Pence <HI>per</HI> Barrel Exci&s;e, which is excluded out of the Six Shillings <HI>per</HI> Barrel.</P>
<P>The &s;trong was &s;uppo&s;ed at Eighteen or Twenty Shillings <HI>per</HI> Barrel, and payed Four Shillings Nine Pence Exci&s;e, which is included in the Eighteen or Twenty Shillings <HI>per</HI> Barrel.</P>
<P>There is in <HI>Scotland</HI> but one Denomination of Exci&s;e|able Beer, <HI>which we call, as above for &V;&s;e &s;ake,</HI> Tippony.</P>
<P>This was &s;old for about Nine Shillings Six Pence <HI>Sterling per</HI> Twelve <HI>Scots</HI> Gallons to the Retailer, and payed Twenty Three Pence <HI>&s;terling</HI> Duty, which is not included in the Nine Shillings Six Pence.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> Twelve <HI>Scots</HI> Gallons was &s;uppo&s;ed to hold much about the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ale Gauge of Thirty Four Gal|lons,
<PB N="97" REF="384">
there were &s;ome Fractions or &s;mall Differences, which the Committee did not Examine into; Of which by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Taking then this <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Exci&s;e from Twenty &s;hilling <HI>per</HI> Barrel downward to Nine Shillings Six Pence; or from Six Shillings <HI>per</HI> Barrel upward to Nine Shillings Six Pence; and then Calculate the Exci&s;e from either of the&s;e Extremes, and the middle &s;eemed to be a ju&s;t Exci&s;e; and this Project had two happy Circum&s;tances in it, which exactly &s;upplyed the Difficulty.</P>
<P><HI>For Example.</HI></P>
<P>The Price of the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;trong Beer being Nine Shillings Six|pence <HI>per</HI> Barrel <HI>exclu&s;ive</HI> of the Exci&s;e, and the Price of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Beer <HI>reckoning it at Twenty Shillings</HI> per <HI>Barrel</HI> inclu&s;ive <HI>of the Exci&s;e,</HI> being Fourteen Shillings Three Pence <HI>per</HI> Barrel, <HI>exclu&s;ive</HI> of the Exci&s;e, Nine Shillings Sixpence is to Fourteen Shillings Three pence, as Nineteen to Fourteen Shillings Nine|pence.</P>
<P>Thus,</P>
<P>9 <HI>&s;h.</HI> 6 <HI>d. &s;terling</HI> is Pence 114, the Price of the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;trong Beer <HI>exclu&s;ive</HI> of the Exci&s;e.</P>
<P>14 <HI>&s;h.</HI> 3. <HI>d. &s;terling</HI> is Pence 171&mdash;<HI>Ditto.</HI> of the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>Two Thirds of 171, which is 14 <HI>&s;h.</HI> 3 <HI>d.</HI> is 114, which is 9 <HI>&s;h.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>Two Thirds of 57 Pence, which is 4 <HI>&s;h.</HI> 9 <HI>d.</HI> is 19 <HI>d.</HI> which is the <HI>Medium</HI> of Exci&s;e this way.</P>
<P>Again, if you begin at the lowe&s;t Rate of the Exci&s;e, and the lowe&s;t Price of Beer, and from thence draw the Proporti|on upward, then Two Shillings the pre&s;ent &s;tated Exci&s;e, is the &s;ame to Twelve, as Fifteen Pence is to Six Shil. or &s;o near it, as they &s;ell the Beer <HI>inclu&s;ive:</HI> So that the difference is of no extraordinary Con&s;equence; <HI>For Example,</HI></P>
<P>Twelve Gallons <HI>Scots</HI> paying Two Shillings Exci&s;e, is &s;old for Twelve Shilling <HI>&s;terling</HI> including the Duty.</P>
<P>One Barrel <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;mall <HI>Beer,</HI> paying One Shilling Three Pence Exci&s;e, is &s;old at Seven Shillings Six Pence <HI>per</HI> Barrel <HI>inclu&s;ive</HI> of the Duty.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> Two Shilling is One &s;ixth Part of Twelve Shilling, and One Shilling Three Pence is One &s;ixth Part of Seven Shillings Six Pence.</P>
<P>Thus the Exci&s;e of both Kingdoms &s;tands upon the &s;ame Foot, and are an Exact proportion to one another; and ha|ving drawn a rough Scheme of the&s;e Proportions, the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners Ordered them to be laid before them, Fini&s;hed the
<PB N="98" REF="385">
next Morning, which was done; And the Author had the Honour done him to have them Accepted, which was a full Reward to him, and compleatly &s;uited to his Expectations; And they &s;tand in the Treaty of Union in his very Words.</P>
<P>This is put down here, not at all to Value the Merit of the Author upon, but however, to do him&s;elf Ju&s;tice again&s;t a&s;|&s;uming Pretenders.</P>
<P>As to the Mi&s;take between the Brewers and the Exci&s;e Of|fice, which fell out afterward in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and which &s;ome People indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;trove to blow into a Flame, it is explained in its Place.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>The Affair of the Rabbles in the Country came now before the Parliament, for things were come to that Height in the Coun|try, that it was no longer to be Tampered with; The Party who oppo&s;ed the Union had &s;o far prevailed upon the People, that they began to break all Bounds; at <HI>Dumfries</HI> the Articles of the Union were burnt at the Market Cro&s;s, by a Number of People in Arms, tho' they were not near &s;o many as was Reported at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> where they indu&s;triou&s;ly enlarged tho&s;e Reports, to Intimidate the Party that was for the Union, and, <HI>if po&s;&s;ible,</HI> to &s;et the Mob in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> to Work again; But the Guards there did their Duty &s;o effectually, that there was no more Appearance in the Street, tho' loud Threatnings were made of it.</P>
<P>As to the Burning the Articles, it was true, That a Num|ber of People being got together, did publickly burn the Ar|ticles of the Union, as concluded at <HI>London,</HI> with the Li&s;t of the Names of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Treaty, and did affix a Paper upon the Cro&s;s of <HI>Dumfreis,</HI> which they called, <HI>Rea&s;ons for and De&s;igns in Burning the Articles, &amp;c.</HI> after having read the &s;aid Paper from the Cro&s;s.</P>
<P>This Paper was afterwards printed, and the Printer being ordered to be apprehended, fled for it till the fir&s;t Heat was over, and then he appeared again, and was not que&s;tioned for it.</P>
<P>The Copy of the &s;aid Paper is added in the <HI>Appendix</HI> to this Work, <HI>N^o. E x.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="387">
But it is to be noted, That whereas the Paper mentions Squadrons of Foot and Hor&s;e, and the Report was of 5000 and 7000 People, 5000 in Arms that entered the Town, and 7000 in the Hills to &s;upport them&mdash;; It was all Ru|mour, the mo&s;t that appeared in this Action being about 200, and the&s;e in no &s;ort of Military Order or Equippage, as I have noted before.</P>
<P>Yet was this Di&s;order improved to a great Height, and particularly as it was improved to make the Government ap|prehend, the We&s;tern People were re&s;olved to concern them|&s;elves in this Affair, and to take Arms again&s;t the Govern|ment; The Parliament was very &s;en&s;ible of this, and being very loth to have any Force made u&s;e of, they tryed all the Methods po&s;&s;ible, by Proclamations, and publick Repealing the Licence for Mu&s;tering, to take away all Opportunity of A&s;&s;embling together, by which the People might be drawn into the Snare.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable, That even, in the Hou&s;e, there appeared &s;ome, who were very loth to have the&s;e Rabbles di&s;courag|ed and di&s;countenanced; And tho I could give more par|ticular In&s;tances of it, yet this of Objecting again&s;t the Cer|tainty of the Accounts, viz. <HI>That it did not appear, that there was a particular Information of any Tumultuary Meetings, or Irregular Convocations;</HI> This, I &s;ay, is a clear Proof of it, for the&s;e Objectors were openly again&s;t preventing the Mu&s;tering or A&s;&s;embling the Lieges according to the Act of Security, and gave this Sugge&s;tion, viz. <HI>Want of Information</HI> for a Rea&s;on, whereas the Matter of Fact was, That the Lord Commi&s;&s;io|ner had real and direct Information of this Affair of <HI>Dumfries,</HI> and of private Emi&s;&s;aries gone abroad to excite the People to take Arms, and the re&s;pective Meetings of the&s;e Agents or Emi&s;&s;aries in the County of <HI>Lanerk,</HI> and el&s;ewhere, more than &s;ufficient to ju&s;tifie the Precautions mentioned in the Minute.</P>
<P>Upon this Debate the Proclamation was Voted, and the Act of Security, &s;o far as it concerned this Ca&s;e, was repealed, which had various Effects in &s;everal parts of the Country, in &s;ome places it really cru&s;h'd and prevented their a&s;&s;embling, at <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> it irritated and provoked them, and made them more Furious than before&mdash;; But generally it had a very good Effect, for it took away the pretence which any of the Lairds or Heads of Clans might have had before, to have ap|peared with the People in Arms, and under the pretence whereof, they might have been exonered in Law, while an Act of Parliament was in Force to protect them, for no Man could &s;ay, if a Gentleman gathered 100 or 500 Men together, that he had any ill De&s;ign, and tho' he Arm'd them and Train'd them, and kept them together, he could not be accu&s;ed for any Crime, becau&s;e the Law allowed him to do &s;o,
<PB N="101" REF="388">
under pretence of Arming and Di&s;ciplining the Fencible Men, as Authorized by the Act of Security.</P>
<P>This appeared therefore &s;o nece&s;&s;ary at this Time, That a Propo&s;al was immediately brought in to Repeal that part of the Act of Security, at lea&s;t to Su&s;pend it for a Time; There was great Oppo&s;ition made to this Propo&s;al, and abun|dance of Speeches made Applauding the Act of Security, how difficultly it was obtained, and how much of the Liber|ty of <HI>Scotland</HI> depended upon it&mdash;; But the Motion be|ing &s;econded with the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Time, and the Cau&s;es as above, and withal the Propo&s;al being made to extend it only to the Time of the pre&s;ent Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, as <HI>per</HI> the Vote, it admitted the le&s;s Oppo&s;ition.</P>

<P>The Debates of this Day were principally taken up about Re|pealing the Clau&s;e of the Act of Security anent Arming &amp; Exer|ci&s;ing as before, and great Struggles were made to pre&s;erve the Clau&s;e, but it look'd &s;o like Abetting the Tumults which were now in their Height, that no Man could &s;peak heartily to it, for all Men pretended, at lea&s;t, to di&s;owne the De&s;ign of Rabbling the Parliament, and breaking up their Con&s;ultations by Tumults and Violence, but yet, as far as they could drive it, they oppo&s;ed this Vote.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXXII.</HEAD>
<P>The Affair of the Malt-Tax came upon the Stage, in the Debate of the Fourteenth Article, becau&s;e it was but a Tem|porary Tax in <HI>England;</HI> and therefore was to be Con&s;idered among&s;t the&s;e Things, which the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain</HI> might hereafter lay Taxes upon.</P>
<P>The Treaters had Acquie&s;ced in a Suppo&s;ition offered in <HI>En|gland</HI> in the&s;e Words, <HI>That the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to lay any &s;orts of Burdens upon the &V;nited King|dom, but what they &s;hall find of Nece&s;&s;ity at that time for the Pre&s;er|vation and Good of the whole and with due Regard to the Circum&s;tan|ces and Abilities of every part of the &V;nited Kingdom; Therefore it is agreed, that there be no further Exemption in&s;i&s;ted upon for any part of the &V;nited Kingdom, but that the Con&s;ideration of any Exemp|tions beyond what are already agreed on in this Treaty &s;hall be left to the Determination of the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain; Upon this Account they did not in&s;i&s;t upon Exemptions of Duties any further, than the &s;aid Duties were then Extended in <HI>England.</HI> But People were now come a greater length, and they did not care to Tru&s;t the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament &s;o far&mdash;; They had encouraged all manner of Jealou&s;ies of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, the People had received no Notions, but of <HI>Scotlands</HI> being always Oppre&s;t by them, both in Civil and Religious Con|cerns: And that therefore nothing was to be left to them. That the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament was to be Fenced again&s;t as a declared Enemy, and the Repre&s;entatives of <HI>Scotland</HI> being like to be but a Few, <HI>viz. Fourty Five</HI> to Five Hundred and Thirteen, they were to be Cru&s;hed by Number, Outvoted and Di&s;regarded in every Thing relating to <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>There is no more Wonder to be made, that they were for making every Thing &s;ecure, and &s;ettling it to Points and Punctilios, who had entertain'd &s;uch Notions as the&s;e; The Malt-Tax therefore being acknowledged In&s;upportable in <HI>Scot|land,</HI>
<PB N="107" REF="394">
and the Treaters having Determined it &s;o, and Exemp|ted <HI>Scotland</HI> from it, for as long Time as it was now in Force in <HI>England,</HI> the Parliament building upon that Suppo&s;ition, re&s;olve to Determine the time of the Exemption, that they may be &s;ure of it.</P>
<P>It was moved very briskly, That <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould for ever be Exempt from it; but that went not far, as appears in the Vote, &s;ome were for a certain Term of years, &s;ome for an Exemption during the War, others for a certain Number of years after the War.</P>
<P>The Exemption during the War, &s;eem'd the mo&s;t rational, becau&s;e it was known, that the Tax upon Malt was a Tem|porary Tax, given but upon the Emergence of the War, and as the Gentry of <HI>England</HI> were with difficulty brought to &s;ub|mit to it, &s;o they were not Ea&s;ie under it, and would never &s;uffer it to continue after the War, having for that End given it but from year to year, that it might not be entangled with Anticipations, or appropriated to Payments that &s;hould con|tinue it; And therefore to Exempt <HI>Scotland</HI> during the War, was a total Exemption in its kind, and &s;eemed &s;ufficient&mdash;; This was Oppo&s;ed <HI>a little,</HI> but as being a Point gain'd, tho&s;e who &s;ought the Regulation of Conditions only, came freely into it, and &s;o it pa&s;&s;ed.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXXIII.</HEAD>
<P>The Debate of this Day run only upon the Affair men|tioned before, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether they &s;hould depend upon the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament maintaining a ju&s;t and equal Regard to the Good of the whole United I&s;land after the Union, and that they would have Re&s;pect to the Circum&s;tances of every part in their laying on Taxes, or whether they &s;hould pin them down in all time coming, that no other Burdens or Taxes &s;hould be laid on, than tho&s;e already mentioned.</P>
<P>The Suppo&s;ition of the Parliament of <HI>Britains</HI> being par|tial again&s;t <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Repre&s;entatives of <HI>Scotland</HI> be|ing few, being oppre&s;s'd and out-voted, as I have noted al|ready, tho' it was a Popular Notion, and improved to an extravagant Height without Doors, yet it had not obtained &s;o, as to be owned in the Parliament, nor indeed could any Man, with ju&s;t Rea&s;on, have &s;uppo&s;ed &s;uch a thing; And therefore, to offer at a po&s;itive Limitation on the Parliament of <HI>Britain,</HI> &s;eemed to have &s;omething in it very har&s;h.</P>
<P>Again it was alledged, That, to Limit the Parliament of <HI>Britain,</HI> not to lay on any other Cu&s;toms, Exci&s;es, Taxes, Duties or Burdens, than tho&s;e con&s;ented to in this Act, was to take away the Power from the People of <HI>Britain,</HI> to conform their Affairs even to their own Circum&s;tances, &s;ince the Time might come, when &s;ome of the&s;e Duties might become bur|den&s;ome, that now were not &s;o, and others, which now would be burden&s;ome, might be more for the Publick Service; but to ty the Parliament down ab&s;olutely as in this Clau&s;e, would be to Limit them from making Alterations in the Publick Taxes, tho' apparently for the Publick Advantage, and would in effect take from them that Power, for which they were really con&s;tituted, <HI>viz.</HI> To Di&s;po&s;e the Peoples Pur&s;es, and Redre&s;s their Grievances.</P>
<P>It was long Argued, That the Parliament ought to be Li|mited in this Ca&s;e, becau&s;e of the Danger there was of <HI>Scot|land</HI> being burdened with Intolerable Taxes, and of the pre|&s;ent Circum&s;tances of <HI>Scotland</HI> which were allowed to be un|able to bear them; That under the pretence of Alteration of Taxes, Oppre&s;&s;ive Duties might be laid upon <HI>Scotland,</HI> which, tho' they might be tolerable in <HI>England,</HI> were not &s;o here, and they ought to provide again&s;t them.</P>
<P>But it was Re&s;olved at la&s;t into this, That all future Con|tingencies mu&s;t be left to a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, and the Words of the Articles contained a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on for &s;o doing, <HI>viz. It could not be &s;uppo&s;ed, That the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>will ever lay any &s;orts of Burdens upon the &V;nited King|dom, but what they &s;hall find of Nece&s;&s;ity, at that time, for the Pre&s;ervation and Good of the whole, and with due Regard to the Cir|cum&s;tances</HI>
<PB N="109" REF="396">
<HI>and Abilities of every part of the &V;nited Kingdom; Therefore it is Agreed, That there be no further Exemption in&s;i&s;t|ed upon for any part of the &V;nited Kingdom, but that the Con&s;ideration of any Exemptions, beyond what are already agreed on in this Treaty, &s;hall be left to the Determination of the Parlia|ment of</HI> Great-Britain.</P>
<P>And thus, with &s;ome Difficulty, the Clau&s;e was pa&s;s'd, without any further Amendment.</P>

<P>They were now come to the great Article of the Equiva|lent; It had been offered at in the &leftblank; Article, and by Con&s;ent referred to a Committee, which Committee had &s;pent a great deal of Time upon it, had Examined all the Calcula|tions made by the Clerks imployed in <HI>London</HI> during the Trea|ty, had ca&s;t up the Intere&s;ts, and the Valuation of Years, to reduce every Annual payment upon ready Money, upon equal Rebates &amp; Allowances, and their Report was now brought in, by which it appears, That the Calculations made in <HI>England</HI> were very ju&s;t, &s;o that no Objection lay again&s;t that part of the Work.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Que&s;tion then was, Why <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould concern it &s;elf in paying <HI>Englands</HI> Debts at all, and on this Head it is nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;omething large, &s;ince the Learned Debates on this Head filled the whole Nation, and the Oppo&s;ers of the Union advanced abundance of Objections again&s;t the very Thing called an Equivalent, in the fir&s;t place, as needle&s;s and impertinent; That <HI>England</HI> &s;hould pay its own Debts, and keep her own Money, and the like; That, to make <HI>Scotland</HI>
<PB N="111" REF="398">
pay Taxes, and then give her an Equivalent, was doing no|thing as to Equalities, for that tho' it might be an Equality, Nationally &s;peaking, it had no Per&s;onal Ju&s;tice or Equality at all, &s;ince the private Per&s;ons that &s;hould pay it, would never receive any Equivalent for the Injury they received.</P>
<P>Some An&s;wers to this I &s;hall &s;et down here, as they were argued in the Hou&s;e, and after made publick by an Honou|rable Member of the Parliament, now Baron of the Exchequer in <HI>Scotland,</HI> Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> of <HI>Pennycook.</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1.

The Rea&s;on is plain, for other|wi&s;e the Merchants re&s;iding in <HI>Scotland,</HI> would be put in a Condition to Ruine the whole Trade of <HI>England.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That an <HI>Equality of Exci&s;es</HI> in both Kingdoms, is as nece&s;&s;ary as an <HI>Equality of Cu&s;toms,</HI> for not only all imme|diate Burdens on <HI>Trade</HI> are to be regarded, but even the&s;e things which Affect and Influence Trade.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That tho' a <HI>Federal &V;nion</HI> was Practicable between the two kingdoms (as I believe it is not) yet even by that Union, we behoved to undergo the Burden of equal Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;es, otherwi&s;e there could be no Com|munication of Trade.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That a great part of <HI>the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;es</HI> is appropriated towards Payment of their Debts; &s;o that the paying of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Debts, and the paying of equal Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;es, are almo&s;t reciprocal Terms to &s;igni|fie one and the &s;ame thing, or otherwi&s;e, that the&s;e Cu|&s;toms and Exci&s;es payed after the Union, will be appro|priated towards paying our own Debts, which is the &s;ame, as &s;hall more fully appear hereafter.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That the&s;e Debts (being after the Union, to be called <HI>The Debts of</HI> Great-Britain) are &s;o nece&s;&s;ary and in|evitable Burdens on <HI>Scotland,</HI> that neither by an Incorpo|rating or Federal Union with <HI>England,</HI> can <HI>Scotland</HI> be free of 'em, &s;ince as is &s;aid before, they are included and wrap|ped up in the very Notion of equal Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;es.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>From the&s;e Po&s;itions it follows, That &s;ince under all &s;orts of Union what&s;omever, with a Communication of Trade, we mu&s;t be Subjected to <HI>equal Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;es,</HI> and that a great part of the&s;e is applyed towards Payment of the <HI>Debts of</HI> England, therefore in common Ju&s;tice, a Provi&s;ion behoved to be made to <HI>Scotland,</HI> for re-imbur&s;ing what we &s;hall be charged on the Score of the&s;e Debts, which by <HI>this Article of the Treaty,</HI> is called <HI>An Equivalent.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Equivalent</HI> is &s;o Contrived and Adju&s;ted, that thereby we cannot properly look on our &s;elves as engaged
<PB N="112" REF="399">
in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Debts, for no Man can be properly &s;aid to pay a Debt for another, when the Money is either advan|ced before hand to the Payer, or at furthe&s;t, the next Mo|ment after it is payed out, which will be <HI>Scotlands</HI> Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>It was evident that a Communication of Trade was the In|tere&s;t of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and was the cleare&s;t Advantage on the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;ide, and mo&s;t Unexceptionable in the whole Treaty; It was impo&s;&s;ible this Communication of Trade could be E|&s;tabli&s;hed, and could be entirely Free, unle&s;s an Equality of Cu&s;toms, Exci&s;es, and of all &s;orts of Payments were &s;ettled at the &s;ame Time; So that the&s;e People who were &s;o back|ward to come into the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Debts, were leading into a Re|jecting the only Advantage, which they them&s;elves acknow|ledged was to be had by the Union.</P>
<P>The Equality of Exci&s;es and Cu&s;toms being thus ab&s;olute|ly nece&s;&s;ary, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Debts came to be concerned, be|cau&s;e the Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;es of <HI>England</HI> being appropri|ated as Funds to pay the Intere&s;ts of Annuities, and &s;uch In|cumbrances, the &s;ame Duties in <HI>Scotland</HI> would of cour&s;e run in the &s;ame Channel, come into the &s;ame Charge, and under the &s;ame Incumbrances, as it could not be otherwi&s;e, without running Things into all manner of Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Treaters in <HI>London</HI> had been convinc'd of this, and therefore readily came into it, demanding an Equivalent to <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;uited to &s;o much of the <HI>Scots</HI> Revenue, as &s;hould be &s;o appropriated to the payment of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Debts.</P>
<P>But it was the harde&s;t Thing in the World, to make the People in <HI>Scotland</HI> apprehend it&mdash;; Not but that tho&s;e who were more immediately concern'd in the Debating it, under&s;tood it well enough; But it &s;erv'd as a Handle to Rally the Union, &amp; the Thing being rendred as Intricate to the com|mon People as po&s;&s;ible, that they might be the more moved to Oppo&s;e it; The&s;e Ignorantly running away with a Noti|on, that <HI>Scotland</HI> was to pay the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Debts, began to Rage at the Treaters again, and cry out, <HI>They were Sold and Betray|ed;</HI> to tell them of an Equivalent, was to &s;ay nothing, and as, many did not under&s;tand it, &s;o they that did, would not &s;eem to under&s;tand it; the very Word became Proverbial, and was the Je&s;t of Conver&s;ation, till the Aver&s;ion to it ren|red it in a manner Contemptible. To bring <HI>Scotland</HI> in to pay the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Debts! What was not <HI>Scotland</HI> Poor enough already? Was this the Advantage of the Union! It could not be &s;uffered, and the Treaters had Betrayed them: Such Di&s;cour&s;e as this was the Subject of the common Peoples Con|ver&s;ation, and the An&s;wering them with the &s;tory of an E|quivalent to be paid them, was to tell them &s;omething which they neither under&s;tood, nor entered into the Examination of.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="400">
It would be very hard to de&s;cribe, how this kind of Di&s;|cour&s;e irritated the poor People, and how they were impo&s;ed upon in the daily Accounts &s;pread of this new Wonder, cal|led <HI>The Equivalent,</HI> of which Calculations were made publick, repre&s;enting, That in a year <HI>Scotland</HI> would Repay all the Money advanced from <HI>England,</HI> by the increa&s;e of Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;es; &amp; &s;o after that Rate, notwith&s;tanding of the Equi|valent, <HI>Scotland</HI> would be drawn into an Entail of Taxes for an Hundred Years, to clear off the va&s;t Debt of Twenty Mil|lions, which <HI>England</HI> was now liable to.</P>
<P>I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to An&s;wer this in a &s;ub&s;equent Ob&s;erva|tion. But I can not but <HI>Note,</HI> That by a due Calculation laid be|fore the Parliament, it was made very plain, That <HI>England</HI> would be &s;o far from being Re-imbur&s;t in a Year, <HI>as above,</HI> that reckoning the common Intere&s;t of the Money advanced in the Equivalent, with the <HI>Medium</HI> of Years in which great part of the Duties the other People had Calculated from, was to Expire, the Equivalent Advanced in Money to <HI>Scotland</HI> would not be Re-payed in Ninety Years.</P>
<P>Yet was not all this able to Allay the Prejudices of the People, at the Affair of paying the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Debt, which they run away with &s;o eagerly, and &s;o univer&s;ally Raged again&s;t, that had not the Rabbles been in good time Cru&s;h'd before, and that &s;o effectually, that they could not begin again, it was thought this very thing would have Influenced them to a more dangerous Degree than any thing.</P>
<P>But this was offer'd by degrees, the Work of this Day was only to Debate the fir&s;t Clau&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould be intirely free from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Debts, or whether they &s;hould come in to the Appropriations of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Duties, accep|ting of an Equivalent, and after a very Warm Debate, the Ca&s;e was carried, as by the Minute.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXXV.</HEAD>
<P>The Commmittee to whom the &s;everal Articles about Trade were refer'd, began now to make their Reports, and begin|ning with the Sixth Article concerning Equalities of Allow|ances and Encouragements, they made their Report about the Allowances on Exporting <HI>Victual,</HI> by which is under&s;tood <HI>Corn</HI> only, which is commonly called <HI>Victual</HI> in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>The Allowance here offered by the Committee, was on the&s;e Con&s;iderations, It had been u&s;ed in <HI>England</HI> to give a Bounty or Allowance on the Exportation of Grain, to En|courage the Merchant to Export it, being a &s;ure Rule in Trade, that all the meer Product of the Earth which can be &s;pared and Exported Abroad, over and above the nece&s;&s;ary Con|&s;umption of the Nation, is clear-Gain to the publick Stock.</P>
<P>But Oats in <HI>England</HI> had no Allowance or Bounty on the Exportation, becau&s;e it was generally &s;uppo&s;ed, That <HI>Eng|land</HI> had never any Quantity of Oats to &s;pare more than they Con&s;umed among them&s;elves, but were rather alwi&s;e ready to Buy Oats from Abroad, than to Export them.</P>
<P>On the other hand, Oats being the principal kind of Grain Sowed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> it was equally nece&s;&s;ary to Encourage the Exporting of Oats, as it was to Encourage the Exporting Wheat in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But this was An&s;wered, by telling them, that there was no need of propo&s;ing a Bounty upon the Exportation of Oats, for that <HI>England</HI> would always take off what ever Quantity of Oats they would part with, and to offer a Bounty for Expor|tation of that Abroad, which was really wanted at Home,
<PB N="115" REF="402">
was Ab&s;urd, contrary to the Rules of Trade, and the Nature of the Thing. <HI>Further</HI> it was offered, That &s;hould a Bounty be offer'd on the Exportation of Oats, the Out-ports in <HI>England,</HI> who now &s;upply <HI>London,</HI> lying ready for the Trade to <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> would &s;end all their Oats Abroad, and <HI>London</HI> would not be &s;upplyed but upon dear Rates.</P>
<P>The&s;e Arguments prevailed with the Committee as to Oats, but there being a very Gainful Trade carried on from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>Norway</HI> for Oat-Meal, which it was worth while to encourage, as a Trade that Generally brought into <HI>Scotland</HI> a great deal of Bullion, and Money in <HI>&s;pecie,</HI> the Committee thought fit to place a Bounty upon the Exportation of the Oat-Meal, as <HI>per</HI> the Vote, and the &s;tate of the Time when the &s;aid Bounty &s;hould be paid being fix'd, when Oats &s;hall be no higher than Fifteen Shillings <HI>per</HI> Quarter, there could be no danger, that the greatne&s;s of the Export &s;hould Influence the Market at <HI>London,</HI> &s;o as to make Oats Scarce or Dear, &s;ince after they came to Fifteen Shillings <HI>per</HI> Quarter, no Boun|ty Money could be demanded.</P>
<P>This was founded upon &s;o ju&s;t a Calculation of Equalities in Trade, that it met with no Oppo&s;ition in the Parliament.</P>

<P>Then a Third Report brought in from the &s;aid Committee was read in the&s;e Terms; <HI>The Committee of Parliament appointed for con&s;idering the Sixth Article of the Treaty of Union, and Propo&s;als made in Parliament relative thereto; Having con&s;idered the Clau&s;e mentioned in the Twenty Seventh Days Minutes, anent the Making and Exporting of Plaiding, Fingrams, Galloway-whites, Sarges, Stockings, and all &s;orts of Linen to</HI> England, <HI>Dominions and Planta|tions thereof, or any part beyond Sea, free of any Duty or Impo&s;ition; and having con&s;idered the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Acts of Parliament relative there|unto, particularly the</HI> 32 Act primo Gulielmi &amp; Mariae, <HI>and the Twenty</HI> Act Gul. undecimo &amp; duodecimo, <HI>in regard there appears to be no Re&s;traint at pre&s;ent; regulating the way and manner of mak|ing</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Woollen Cloaths and others to be Exported, and that all the Woollen Manufactures are declared to be free of Duty and Impo|&s;ition what&s;oever at Exporting, and that, by the &s;aid Sixth Article of the Treaty of Union; all parts of the United Kingdom are to have the &s;ame Allowances and Encouragements; Therefore the Committee are of Opinion, That the adding the fore&s;aid Clau&s;e to the Articles of Treaty is unnece&s;&s;ary.</HI></P>

<P>Notwith&s;tanding what was argued in the Committeee, which I have noted above, and at which I was pre&s;ent, having had the Occa&s;ion to make &s;everal of the&s;e Calculations for the Service of the &s;aid Committee: Some Gentlemen in the Par|liament in&s;i&s;ted upon the allowing a Drawback or Bounty Money upon Exportation <HI>of Oats;</HI> but when the &s;ame Rea|&s;ons mentioned above, which had been argued in the Com|mittee, came to be offered in full Parliament, it was &s;o con|vincing, that they &s;oon acquie&s;c'd, and &s;o it was carryed without, as <HI>per</HI> the Minute.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;equent Reports of the Committee mentioned in this Days Minutes, &s;eemed only to add the Authority of the Committees Examinations to what had before been offered in Publick, <HI>viz.</HI> That, after the Union, the Exportation of Linen and Woollen Manufactures would be free, and the &s;e|veral Manufactures be under no Re&s;traint or Regulations, but that either in Tran&s;porting them to <HI>England,</HI> or Exporting them to Foreign Parts, all was open and free by the Union.</P>
<P>And this Report of the Committee was a full Proof of what I have all along alledged, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Common People of <HI>Scotland</HI> were intolerably impo&s;ed upon, in the Accounts &s;pread abroad relating e&s;pecially to Trade, and in this in par|ticular, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Scots</HI> Woollen and Linen Manufacture would be &s;ubjected to &s;everal Re&s;trictions and Regulations in <HI>England,</HI> which could not be complyed with.</P>
<P>This was grounded upon an Office in <HI>England,</HI> granted by Patent &s;ome Years &s;ince, which was called the Aulnage, which amounted to no more, than putting a Seal and demanding a Fee upon every parcel of Woollen Manufactures brought to <HI>London,</HI> under pretence of Viewing if they were Marketable&mdash;; But this Duty or Fee being a very &s;mall Trifle, and the Power of In&s;pecting found deficient, it was of no Force at all, and therefore, upon the Committees Examining this, they &s;aw no Ground of Objection.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="405">
The next Objection was about Exportation, and here it is ob&s;ervable, That the Oppo&s;ers of the Union had not only &s;ugge&s;ted, but openly printed, and expo&s;ed about the Streets &s;uch Ab&s;urdities as the&s;e, That the <HI>Scots</HI> Linen would not be admitted into <HI>England,</HI> but a great Duty would be laid upon it to gratifie the <HI>Dutch;</HI> That great Duties were to be paid upon both Linen and Woollen Manufactures on their Exportation, and the like. Now it was very happy, that the&s;e things came to be Con&s;idered and Examined by a Committee.</P>
<P> For now it was evident,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That no Duty could be laid on the Tran&s;porting any Linen or Woollen Goods from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> which were the Growth or Manufacture of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Article of Communication of Trade having effectually taken off all Impo&s;itions between the Counties or Shires of all <HI>Great-Britain</HI> equally to all.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. As to the Duty on Woollen Goods, there never was any Duty paid Outward, but what was called the Old Sub&s;idy of Tonnage and Poundage, which was Five <HI>per Cent.</HI> which had been effectually taken off, &amp; that Act Repealed in the Act of Parliament mentioned in the Re|port, and no Duty at all was paid on any Woollen Ma|nufacture whatever Exported out of <HI>England,</HI> and by Con&s;equence could not be out of <HI>Scotland.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. All Linen Cloth was &s;o free, That the Duty on Cloth Imported to <HI>England</HI> from Foreign Parts, was all drawn back by Certificate on the Exporting it again, in order to encourage the &s;aid Exportation, and for Linen Exported made in <HI>Britain,</HI> it was &s;o &s;mall a Trifle paid, <HI>viz.</HI> Sixpence on Fourty Ells, that it was not worth notice.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>This Report of the Committee put a great Stop to the Cla|mours, that had been &s;o loud upon the Article of Trade; and when this Vote was made publick, the People began to &s;ee they were impo&s;ed upon, and that the&s;e things in <HI>Eng|land</HI> were mi&s;repre&s;ented.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXXVII.</HEAD>
<P>There was a Clau&s;e in the Treaty for the re&s;erving all pri|vate Rights, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as <HI>per</HI> the 20<HI>th</HI> Article; Now &s;ome of the&s;e private Rights amounted to Exemption from certain Cu&s;toms &amp; Exci&s;es, as particular Privileges to this or that Place or Per&s;on, as at <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> for Encouragement of their Sugar-works, they are Ex|empted from paying any Exci&s;e for the Spirits they Di&s;till from the Mela&s;&s;es, Bottoms, Scummings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;o in &s;everal Towns they were Exempted from &s;uch and &s;uch Cu|&s;toms&mdash;; The&s;e were of nece&s;&s;ity to be Exempted, becau&s;e by another Article as above, private Rights on both &s;ides were to be pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>Now, as this was for <HI>Scotland</HI> on one hand, &s;o it was for <HI>England</HI> on another, for the City of <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> and the Family of Sir <HI>Chri&s;topher Mu&s;grave</HI> had an ancient Right of taking Toll of all the Cattel which pa&s;&s;ed from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> over &s;uch Pa&s;&s;es or Bridges as they had the Lord&s;hip of, and the&s;e by private Rights were actually re&s;erved.</P>
<P>But the Committee having demanded here the taking away the Toll, <HI>payed as above,</HI> the private Right on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ide cea&s;ed; So that what &s;eem'd &s;olid and confirm'd by the Uni|on in one part, was yet Invaded and taken away by ano|ther&mdash;. But to Reconcile this Matter, the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> Interpo&s;ed, and when &s;ome People thought they had now brought their Affair to a Head, and that now the Trea|ty mu&s;t break, behold, a <HI>Medium</HI> was found out in <HI>England, viz.</HI> That the Parliament in <HI>England</HI> Bought the&s;e private Rights of the City of <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> and of the Family of Sir <HI>Chri|&s;topher Mu&s;grave,</HI> and giving them an Equivalent for them, they Acquie&s;ced, and all ways were laid open for all manner of <HI>Scots</HI> or <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods to Pa&s;s and Repa&s;s without any Toll, Stoppage, or Interruption, whether Cattle or Corn, or any other kind of Goods except &s;uch as (<HI>Scotland</HI> being Ex|empted from the Taxes of in this Treaty for a Time,) were not to be carried into <HI>England</HI> during that Limited Time, or if they were carried in, were lyable to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Duties as &s;oon as they came into <HI>England,</HI> &s;uch as Salt, Coals, Malt, Fi&s;h Cur'd with <HI>Scots</HI> Salt, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> As is more particularly Explained hereafter.</P>
<P>Thus the private Rights in <HI>Scotland</HI> were pre&s;erved intire, according to the Treaty, and in <HI>England</HI> al&s;o, for if they were Invaded by the Treaty, the Subject had &s;uch &s;atisfaction gi|ven him in Money, as that he appeared willing to Re&s;ign tho&s;e Rights&mdash;, as the City of <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> for in&s;tance, who, I think, had Two Thou&s;and Five Hundred Pound <HI>Sterling</HI> given them, for parting with the Right of Toll upon <HI>Scots</HI> Cattle, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="409">
In this exact Equality, the Sixth Report of the Commit|tee about <HI>Scots</HI> Cattle, became as it were &s;ettled; but it was Objected, That the Parliament might hereafter lay on a par|ticular Tax upon the <HI>Scots</HI> Cattle pa&s;&s;ing into <HI>England,</HI> either in Favours of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Cattle, or upon any other &s;ub&s;equent Oc|ca&s;ion which could not be fore&s;een; And therefore, the &s;end|ing Lean Cattle from <HI>Scotland</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> being &s;uch a con&s;iderable Article to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and on which the E&s;tates of the Northern Gentry did almo&s;t wholly depend, all their Rents being paid them in Cattle, for which they had no other Vent or Market but their being &s;ent into <HI>England,</HI> and that any Tax or Toll being hereafter laid on them, might intire|ly put a &s;top to it, and con&s;equently Impair, and almo&s;t Ruine the E&s;tates of the Gentry and Nobility of <HI>Scotland;</HI> On this Con&s;ideration, it was thought fit by the Committee, to &s;ecure <HI>Scotland</HI> effectually from &s;o much as a Jealou&s;ie or Unea&s;ine&s;s about it, by making it a Part of the Union, That <HI>From and after the &V;nion, no</HI> Scots <HI>Cattle carried into</HI> England <HI>&s;hall be liable to any other Duties either publick or private than the Cattle of</HI> England. This was again an Article of Equality, for the Ca&s;e was, not to Exempt the <HI>Scots</HI> Cattle intirely from any Tax, which the United Parliament might think fit to lay on Cattle in General, if ever the Article of General Ex|ci&s;es &s;o much talk'd of in <HI>England,</HI> &s;hould be offered at; but to bring the <HI>Scots</HI> Cattle upon a Level with all the re&s;t of the Cattle in <HI>England;</HI> and to provide that <HI>Scots</HI> Cattle, <HI>Qua</HI> Scots <HI>Cattle,</HI> &s;hould be under no particular National Di&s;ad|vantage&mdash;; And this was thought Rea&s;onable on every &s;ide.</P>
<P>The Seventh Report of the Committee requires &s;ome Ex|plication on &s;everal Accounts&mdash;, It was true, and no Que|&s;tion was to be made of it, That <HI>Scotland</HI> having then an open Trade with <HI>France</HI> without Re&s;triction, and that their Wooll was under no Prohibition at all, but freely Exported to <HI>France,</HI> or any other Part of the World, and that this Li|berty being by the Union to be ab&s;olutely and intirely Re|&s;trained, the Prices of Wooll in <HI>Scotland</HI> would of cour&s;e very much Fall, and the Gentlemen of the South and We&s;t Parts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;uch as in <HI>Roxburgh</HI> Shire, <HI>Selkirk, Tweed|dale,</HI> and <HI>Galloway,</HI> who&s;e E&s;tates very much con&s;i&s;ted in the Product of their Sheep, would receive a very &s;en&s;ible Blow by it; Tho' it was remarkable that &s;ome People was for gi|ving all <HI>Britain</HI> a wor&s;e Blow, to prevent the Injury done to tho&s;e Countries, <HI>viz.</HI> To allow Exporting the Wooll, and &s;ome Warm Debates were upon this Head.</P>
<P>To Explain this, it was to be Enquired into, under what kind of Influence, and by who&s;e Management the Trade of <HI>Scotland</HI> was at fir&s;t laid open, and the Exporting of Wooll permitted in General; This as it produc'd no Effect, but the ripping up old Sores, and reviving Per&s;onal and Party Re|flections,
<PB N="123" REF="410">
I &s;hall let Fall. But this was certain, That whoever were the the Occa&s;ion of it, the Shipping off the Wooll from <HI>Scotland,</HI> was very Injurious to the publick Advantage of <HI>Scotland,</HI> a Mortal Wound given to the Indu&s;try of the Peo|ple, di&s;couraging all Attempts of Manufacturing among them, which they were now coming into, and which their Neigh|bours of <HI>England</HI> had &s;o much been Enriched by: It was ap|parent, That the &s;mall Exportation they formerly had of coar&s;e Woollen Manufactures to <HI>Swedeland</HI> and the <HI>Baltick,</HI> was now almo&s;t brought to a full Stop, and the <HI>Swedes</HI> on the con|trary took their Wooll from <HI>Scotland,</HI> which they had not been u&s;ed to do, by which it was apparent, they having the Wooll, made the Manufactures them&s;elves, and this was a dead Lo&s;s to <HI>Scotland,</HI> ju&s;t &s;o much as the Employment and Labour of their Poor amounted to.</P>
<P>From this part of National ill Husbandry, no Body could be &s;uppo&s;ed to receive any Benefit, except the Exporter and the Wooll Ma&s;ter, &s;o they call the Gentlemen of <HI>Galloway, Roxburgh</HI> Shire, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who&s;e E&s;tates are very much depend|ing upon Sheep.</P>
<P>This being the Occa&s;ion of the Ri&s;ing the Prices of their Wooll, and their Advantage being thus begun in the Error and Injury of their Country, it &s;eemed to be no National Affair to make good the Lo&s;s that was &s;uppo&s;ed now to hap|pen by the Union; which was indeed but reducing Things to where they were before, and taking away that Advantage, which, if the Eyes of their Repre&s;entatives in former Par|liaments had been open, they had never had, and which it was the great Lo&s;s of the whole Kingdom, that they ever had at all.</P>
<P>However the Parliament, who, going upon the great Scheme of Equalities &s;o often mentioned, appeared willing to make all People ea&s;y; were ready and forward enough to have an Allowance by way of Equivalent given to the Gentlemen that were Sheep Ma&s;ters, and who &s;hould be pinched by the falling of the price of their Wooll; but then it was debated, in what manner that Equivalent &s;hould be given, for, to give to particular Per&s;ons &s;uch and &s;uch a Sum of Money, would &s;eem partial, and be &s;hort of the De&s;ign; as it would be &s;ome Per&s;onal Satisfaction indeed, but no National Satisfaction: The Money given therefore ought to be for the Publick Good; and this could be by no Method &s;o exactly &s;tated to the Circum&s;tance, as by appropriating the Money to &s;uch Gentlemen, who being Wooll Ma&s;ters, would apply that Money to the Manufacturing that Wooll in their own Country; thereby both encrea&s;ing the Con&s;ump|tion of the Wooll, and &s;etting the Poor of their re&s;pective Countries to Work&mdash;; This Scheme had too much Equi|ty in it, and too much of the Publick Good in it to be di&s;|liked,
<PB N="124" REF="411">
nor did tho&s;e that oppo&s;ed it pretend to object much again&s;t the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of it, but &s;till it was oppo&s;ed, and the Rea&s;ons for which it was oppo&s;ed were manife&s;t.</P>
<P>The Party, who, as I have all along noted, &s;ought &s;ome Occa&s;ion or other to break off the Treaty, had now this Me|thod only left, <HI>viz.</HI> To clog the Affair with &s;uch Amendments or Alterations, which they knew <HI>England</HI> either would not or could not grant&mdash;; Nor did they &s;tick in Conver&s;ati|on hone&s;tly to owne, That they did not di&s;like the Rea&s;ons of &s;everal Things that they oppo&s;ed, were they con&s;enting to the Union in general, but they were <HI>again&s;t the &V;NION,</HI> and therefore they were obliged to oppo&s;e the Particulars, in order to oppo&s;e the General.</P>
<P>The&s;e Gentlemen therefore very warmly argued for a Free|dom of Exportation of Wooll, and for having it made a Clau&s;e in the Articles; which, if they had gain'd, they ea&s;ily fore|&s;aw the Union mu&s;t &s;plit upon that Rock, for that <HI>England,</HI> who have made it Felony, and always prohibited the Export of their Wooll under the greate&s;t Penalties, neither would or indeed could come into it.</P>
<P>It was urged, this Liberty of Exporting Wooll might be re&s;trained to <HI>Scotland</HI> only; That it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>Scotland,</HI> for that they could not Manufacture all their Wooll in their own Country; That their Wool was Coar&s;e, and did not injure the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade, &s;ince all their Manu|factures were of Fine Wooll; That, if <HI>Scotland</HI> could not Manufacture their Wooll, nor &s;hould be &s;uffered to Export it, the Wooll would be of no U&s;e, but mu&s;t peri&s;h, and be good for nothing; That the Manufactures now &s;et up in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> being chiefly Fine Goods, were generally made of <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Wooll, and after the Union, the Wooll from <HI>England</HI> be|ing generally brought in thither, the Wooll of <HI>Scotland</HI> would be of no manner of Value.</P>
<P>But the&s;e Arguments were An&s;wered thus, That, to allow the Exportation of Wooll from <HI>Scotland</HI> only, would oblige the Government to keep &s;till on the Borders, an Army of Offi|cers, to Search and Examine the Pa&s;&s;age of all Goods pa&s;&s;ing between the Kingdoms, and keep up that Di&s;tinction of King|doms, which, as to Trade, as well as Government, was to be wholly taken away by the Union&mdash;; That, after all, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to prevent the carrying of Wooll into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and con&s;equently the Exportation of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Wooll with, or in&s;tead of <HI>Scots</HI> Wooll.</P>
<P>In the next place, this would oblige the Government of <HI>Britain</HI> to a &s;trict Prohibition of the bringing any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Wooll into <HI>Scotland</HI> after the Union, le&s;t the &s;ame &s;hould be Exported, which, after its being in <HI>Scotland,</HI> could not be &s;o di&s;tingui&s;h'd as to be prevented; and that this Prohibition would Rob <HI>Scotland</HI> of all that Advantage which it is propo|&s;ed
<PB N="125" REF="412">
&s;he &s;hall enjoy after the Union, by her People being im|ployed in the Manufacturing of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Wooll.</P>
<P>Again, That this would de&s;troy all Freedom of Commerce and Communication of Trade between the Kingdoms, that all Ve&s;&s;els to and from <HI>Scotland</HI> mu&s;t be Vi&s;ited and Searched equally with Strangers, and the Face of an Union be ruffled with continued Jealou&s;ies of, and Watchings again&s;t Clande|&s;tine Trade.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, That it was incon&s;i&s;tent with the Publick Good of <HI>Scotland</HI> in its Proportion, as much as of <HI>England,</HI> and that it would effectually de&s;troy the Hopes of <HI>Scotlands</HI> Encrea&s;ing in Manufactures, and Encouraging her Trade by the Imploy|ment of her Poor.</P>
<P>As to the Con&s;umption, it was urged, That <HI>England</HI> was always a Market for Wooll, where it might be &s;old without fail, at &s;ome Price or other; and if the Price was low ju&s;t then, that was but a common Calamity the Effect of the long War with <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> in which they had &s;till a Share with their Neighbours, but that the Wooll of <HI>Scotland</HI> would always &s;ell as well as the Wooll of <HI>England,</HI> in Proportion to its Finene&s;s; And this led of Cour&s;e to the fir&s;t Propo|&s;al, That what Encouragement was po&s;&s;ible to be given to the Wooll Ma&s;ters by the Treaty, &s;hould be given them on the Conditions of &s;etting the Poor to Work in their re&s;|pective Countries, which, in that Ca&s;e, would have this double Advantage, 1. The Employment and Sub&s;i&s;tence of the Poor; and, 2. The Con&s;umption of the Wooll at Home, which directly took off the pretended Nece&s;&s;ity of Exporting it to other Countries, for want of a Vent of it at Home, or their &s;ending it to <HI>England</HI> to be &s;old, as they cal|led it, for little or nothing: How well this Money was paid after the Union, or when paid, how well applyed to the Common Good of <HI>Scotland,</HI> is none of my Bu&s;ine&s;s here to enquire.</P>
<P>I have been the longer in &s;tating this Ca&s;e, becau&s;e it has been often objected to the <HI>Scots</HI> Members of Parlia|ment, That they were too Forward to comply with the Prohibition of Wooll, and that their Country lo&s;t a great Advantage by it.</P>
<P>There was a pretended Expedient then offered, about the manner of Di&s;po&s;ing the Equivalent to &s;uch Per&s;ons, as had &s;uch or &s;uch certain Quantities of Tarr'd Wooll; but the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of the above Propo&s;al prevailed again&s;t any other, and therefore it needs not be enquir|ed into.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>The long Report of the Committee, on this Point of the Cu&s;toms is very di&s;tinct, but may require &s;ome Explanation, and in order to that, it is nece&s;&s;ary to enter into the &s;hort Hi&s;tory of the Rea&s;on of this Calculation.</P>
<P>Two great Complaints ran through the whole Nation up|on the Subject of Taxes and Trade, 1. That the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> clog'd the Trade of <HI>Scotland</HI> with Intolerable Burdens: And 2. That they rai&s;ed their Cu&s;toms, and would Gain great Sums of Money from <HI>Scotland</HI> by doing &s;o; <HI>For the</HI> Scots <HI>had no Notion of the Equivalent, nor would they for along time after this, entertain any Notion of it.</HI></P>
<P>In order to clear up the Objections of the People again&s;t the Cu&s;toms, the particular Heads were referred to this Com|mittee to Examine.</P>

<P>It was now Objected in <HI>Scotland,</HI> That the Cu&s;toms there would be very grievous, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Duties on Tar, Tobacco, Iron, Deals, and Timber, Lint and Lint-Seed, would be Intolerable to the Poor, and rai&s;e the Cu&s;toms of <HI>Scotland</HI> to a very great Height.</P>
<P>The Committee Examined the Proportions of Things, and &s;etting the whole upon an Equality, produc'd a very well grounded Conclu&s;ion, That the Cu&s;toms of <HI>Scotland</HI> would be le&s;s to be paid after the Union than before; and it gave great &s;atisfaction at that time, to tho&s;e People who were capable of receiving Impre&s;&s;ions from ju&s;t Calculations, when the Calculations of this Committee really &s;tated the Ballance of Trade, for that was ea&s;ie to Draw out of the&s;e Calculations: It had been offered in the Parliament, (with how little Foun|dation, or how much A&s;&s;urance, I &s;hall not determine); (1.) That <HI>Scotland</HI> got nothing by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade. (2.) That <HI>Scotland</HI> were con&s;iderable Gainers by the <HI>French</HI> Trade.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>The Report of the Committee on the fir&s;t Paragraph of the Eighth Article is printed in the precedent Minute relating to the Duties on Salt&mdash;; The payment of equal Duties on Foreign Salt was not objected, but it was argued, That the <HI>Scots</HI> Merchants being poor, and being neverthele&s;s obliged to Import large Quantities of Foreign Salt at the proper Times, which mu&s;t ly by till the Sea&s;on for u&s;ing the &s;ame, and the Duties being now very large which were to be paid; they might not be able either to advance the Money, or find &s;ufficient Security for the Duties, as the Law in that Ca&s;e pro|vided&mdash;; And therefore this Amendment was made for the Ea&s;e of the Merchant, which was both Rea&s;onable to the Government, and Ea&s;y to the Merchant, and took off all pretence of Quarrel upon the Disbur&s;e of Money, or lying out of Stock.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Report upon the Eight Article was founded upon equal Rea&s;oning: It had been agreed in <HI>England</HI> in the &s;aid Eighth Article, That all Fle&s;h Salted in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and carryed to <HI>England,</HI> or Fle&s;h Salted in <HI>Scotland</HI> for Victualling Ships or Exportation; &s;hould be Forfeited, if Cured with <HI>Scots</HI> Salt&mdash;; But this was counted a Hard&s;hip on &s;everal Ac|counts, and <HI>England</HI> being allowed to Cure all &s;orts of Fle&s;h with their own, whether for their own Con&s;umption, Victual|ling of Ships or Exportation; it ought to be al&s;o allowed to <HI>Scotland,</HI> by virtue of the Subjects enjoying equal Allowances and Re&s;trictions, <HI>Article</HI> VI. Wherefore the Committee made this Amendment, That the <HI>Scots</HI> might Cure Fle&s;h with their own Salt, provided all Fle&s;h &s;o Cured, that was either &s;ent for <HI>England,</HI> or u&s;ed in Victualling Ships, or Exported for Sale, &s;hould be charged with the Duty on Salt paid in <HI>England,</HI></P>
<P>The Third Report upon the Eighth Article concerned the Laws in Force in <HI>Scotland</HI> for Curing and Packing of Herring, White Fi&s;h and Salmond, which, by this Article, were re|&s;erved; The&s;e Laws were the 5<HI>th. Act</HI> 3<HI>d. Se&s;&s;ion</HI> 1<HI>&s;t. Parliament,</HI>
<PB N="134" REF="421">

<P>But, upon this new Treaty, re&s;pecting the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Duty on Salt, it was calculated as you &s;ee in the Minute, That the Salt commonly u&s;ed in Curing a Barrel of Herring, amounted to about Nine Shillings <HI>per</HI> Barrel; And in regard of the Wa&s;ting of the Salt, Lo&s;s in carrying, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they re|&s;olved to put it at Ten Shillings <HI>per</HI> Barrel, which fully An|&s;wered the Petition of the Fi&s;h and Salt Merchants mentioned in the &s;ame Minute.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XL.</HEAD>
<P>The Report of the Committee la&s;t day was now only Con&s;idered, with Relation to the main part of the Que&s;tion, Whether their Fi&s;h &s;hould be Cured with Foreign Salt only, or not, and it was agreed, it &s;hould be &s;o.</P>
<P>It was counted a very great Hard&s;hip, That the Fi&s;h Cured in <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;hould not be Cured but with Foreign Salt; &s;ome People alledging, That the Salt made in <HI>Scotland</HI> would Cure the Herring as well as Foreign Salt&mdash;; But it had been found by Experience, That the Fi&s;h Cured with <HI>Scots</HI> Salt, did not keep, nor was it equal in Goodne&s;s when it came to Market, which added to the Di&s;putes which would ari&s;e in the Article of the Drawbacks, now coming on to be Debated, made the Parliament po&s;itive in that part, <HI>viz:</HI> That all Fi&s;h Cured for Exportation, &s;hould be Cured with Foreign Salt, without any Mixture of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Salt.</P>
<P>In giving Drawbacks and Allowances for the Exportati|on of Fi&s;h, on Account of the Salt, it had here been impo&s;|&s;ible to come to an Equality, &s;ince no Officer could have been &s;ure which had been Cur'd with <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Salt, and which with Foreign Salt, and which with a Mixture of either.</P>
<P>It was then alledged, That the <HI>Dutch</HI> Importing their Salt from St. <HI>&V;bies,</HI> Re-make the Salt, Boyling it again when they come to <HI>Holland,</HI> which they call <HI>Salt upon Salt,</HI> and that their Herring are Cur'd with the &s;aid Salt, which being of a finer and &s;ubtiler Quality than the other Salt, is of Ad|vantage to their &s;aid Trade; and that the afore&s;aid Encourage|ment &s;hould be given to the <HI>Scots</HI> to do the &s;ame&mdash;; But this came to nothing.</P>

<P>And another Report brought in from the &s;aid Committee was al&s;o read, in the&s;e Terms, <HI>That &s;ixteen Shillings and eight Pence upon every Barrel of Salmond, &s;ix Shilling and eight Pence upon every Barrel of Red-Herrings, that two Pound ten Shillings upon every hundred Cod|fi&s;h, Ling, or Haick, of twenty four Inches and upwards, from the Bone in the Finn to the third Joynt of the Tail; one Pound fifteen Shillings</HI> Sterling <HI>for every &s;uch Fi&s;h of the length of eighteen Inches and up|wards, and under twenty four Inches, and one Moiety of the fore&s;aid Allowance for every &s;uch Fi&s;h dryed, commonly called</HI> Haverdens, <HI>of the like Dimen&s;ions (being the Drawbacks allowed by the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Laws upon the Exportation of the&s;e Fi&s;hes) are &s;ufficient Encouragements.</HI></P>

<P>The Difficulty now lay about &s;ettling the Drawbacks upon the Exportation of Fi&s;h&mdash;; and the Rule the Committee had gone upon, &s;eemed the readie&s;t way to Determine it, <HI>viz.</HI> They laid the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Drawbacks before them, and Exa|mined then the Quantity of Salt u&s;ed in Curing every re|&s;pective kind of Fi&s;h, and then comparing the whole, tryed whether the Drawback allowed was adequate, and proporti|oned to the Duty paid upon the Quantity of Salt u&s;ed in the Curing.</P>

Now, tho' this was Exactly Calculated, and pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e, yet &s;everal Motions and Speeches were made for a larger Drawback, &s;ome alledged the nece&s;&s;ity of Encou|raging the Fi&s;hery in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and that therefore the Govern|ment ought to make larger Allowances; but when they &s;aw that whatever the Allowance &s;hould be which they &s;hould obtain, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would obtain the &s;ame, they dropt that part of the Argument.</P>
<P>The Herrings indeed they had longer Debates about, and after &s;ome Rea&s;onings upon the Wa&s;te of the Salt, the Car|riage and other Pretences, They obtained the Allowance of Ten Shillings and Five Pence to be paid to the Exporter, for every Barrel of Herrings Cured with Foreign Salt and Ex|ported, which was Five Pence <HI>per</HI> Barrel more than the Com|mittee had at fir&s;t Determined.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XLII.</HEAD>
<P>The Drawbacks propo&s;ed upon Beef and Pork to be Ex|ported, were now the Subject of Debate, it had been Examined in the Committee, and they finding, That 1. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had no Allowance made them on Beef and Pork Cured for Exporta|tion.
<PB N="138" REF="425">
And 2. That the Quantity of Beef and Pork &s;o &s;alted, and Exported out of <HI>England,</HI> or out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> was very incon&s;iderable, had Reported, <HI>That there ought to be no Drawbacks upon the Exportation of &s;alted Beef and Pork,</HI> as in the Minute of <HI>December</HI> 19th.</P>
<P>But when this came to be Debated in the Parliament, it was all Unravelled again; Some Gentlemen would have it, That <HI>Scotland</HI> was able to Export great Quantities of Beef, Salted and Cured to Foreign Parts; Nay, &s;ome had before carried it further, and in their Arguing for a Trade with <HI>France,</HI> had advanced what had never before been heard of, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould &s;upply <HI>France</HI> with Beef, as they have formerly been &s;upplyed from <HI>Ireland,</HI> and propo&s;ed In|finite Advantages from &s;uch a Trade&mdash;.</P>
<P>But the&s;e Gentlemen were &s;oon &s;ilenced, when it was Ex|amined a little, upon what Conditions, and in what Quanti|ties <HI>Ireland</HI> was able to &s;upply, and did &s;upply, not <HI>France</HI> and our I&s;land Colonies only, but were able to &s;upply all the Parts of the World, where Beef was Generally Exported&mdash;; That at that time Beef in any Quantity was to be bought, ready Cured in <HI>Ireland,</HI> including the Salt and the Cask it was Packed in, at a Half-penny <HI>&s;terling per</HI> Pound, and that <HI>England</HI> was &s;o convinc'd of this, that they could Export no Fle&s;h, but &s;ent their Ships Generally to <HI>Ireland,</HI> to Load Beef for their I&s;lands, and that <HI>France</HI> upon all Occa&s;ions, got their Beef, if po&s;&s;ible, from <HI>Ireland,</HI> for the Victualling their Navys and Merchant Ships&mdash;. Again, that the Cattel in <HI>Ireland</HI> were Larger and Fatter than in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and their Quantity &s;o great, that <HI>England</HI> was obliged to Prohibit their being brought over thither, otherwi&s;e they would Over run the three Kingdoms with the Quantity; and that <HI>Scotland</HI> having le&s;s Quantity of Feeding Grounds, and their Cattel being Generally Le&s;&s;er, it was not po&s;&s;ible that they could &s;upply the Quantity of Beef, or any thing near the Price with the <HI>Iri&s;h;</HI> and that therefore, it could not be &s;uppo&s;ed, the Exportation of Beef from <HI>Scotland</HI> could be con&s;iderable, any more than from <HI>England;</HI> and on this Foot it was that the Committee made their Report, That it was not needful to allow any Drawback upon the Exportation of Beef, <HI>England</HI> at the &s;ame Time having no Allowances granted in the &s;ame Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>But a new Objection turned the Scale&mdash;, It was offered by &s;ome, That in the North Ea&s;t Parts of <HI>Scotland, viz.</HI> At <HI>Aberdeen</HI> and the Country adjacent, there was a New and very Advantageous Trade, lately Erected for Feeding Swine, which being made Fat with Corn in great Quantities (&amp; that being a Con&s;umption of the Produce of the Land) the Fle&s;h was Cured and Salted, Barrelled and Exported to <HI>Holland</HI> for Sale&mdash;; And that this was a Trade which ought to be Encouraged. It was added, That this as it was an
<PB N="139" REF="426">
Advantageous Trade to <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;o it was a Growing Trade, and might in Time increa&s;e to a very great Degree, the <HI>Dutch</HI> Demanding every year more Quantities than the Country had been yet able to &s;upply, that there had been &s;everal years Exported from 1500 to 2000 Barrels of &s;alted Pork&mdash;from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>Holland,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> u&s;ing the &s;ame for Victualling their Ea&s;t <HI>India</HI> Ships, and other Ships that went upon long Voyages.</P>
<P>This had &s;ome appearance of Argument in it, and being pu&s;h'd very heartily at, in behalf of the <HI>Aberdeen</HI> Merchants; brought the Parliament to alter the Report, and agree to an Allowance upon the Exportation of Pork, and afterward of Beef and Pork, the Beef being brought in by the by.</P>
<P>It had been &s;aid, as above, That the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Beef was Exported Cheaper than <HI>Scotland</HI> could afford it&mdash;; It was therefore Argued, That <HI>Scotland</HI> ought to have the Drawback allowed on their Beef, to encourage the Exportation, and if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;et them upon an equal Foot with <HI>Ireland,</HI> in the Trade of Exporting Beef, which, tho' it was proved, was not pro|bable, yet as the <HI>Affirmative</HI> carried &s;ome po&s;&s;ibility, and the <HI>Negative</HI> &s;eemed to be of no great Con&s;equence, the Members came in to it, and they pa&s;&s;ed together.</P>

<P>The Debates about the Drawbacks on Beef and Pork ended now in a &s;hort Que&s;tion, Whether it &s;hould be Four Shillings Seven Pence <HI>per</HI> Barrel, or Five Shillings&mdash;; And the Difference being of no great Con&s;equence, the &s;ame Argu|ments that carryed it before to have any Drawback at all, carryed it now to have that Drawback &s;ettled at the large&s;t Rate of the Two, &s;o that Affair ended.</P>
<P>Then the Hou&s;e proceeded to the Grand Affair, the Ex|emptions from the Salt Tax in <HI>England</HI>&mdash;; Great Quar|rels were rai&s;ed at the Conce&s;&s;ions made by the Treaters in this Ca&s;e, who had exempted <HI>Scotland</HI> from the Duties on Salt payable in <HI>England</HI> for Seven Years only; whereas it was alledged, That the Salt Tax was a Burden Intolerable for <HI>Scotland,</HI> and that they would no more be able to bear that Duty in &s;even years, than now, and that therefore they ought not to have Subjected <HI>Scotland</HI> to it at all; That it had been allowed, the Salt Tax was a Burden chiefly laid upon the Poor, the Poor People in <HI>Scotland</HI> Feeding much upon &s;alt Meats, and u&s;ing great Quantities of Salt&mdash;; That to lay a Tax on their Salt, was to a&s;&s;i&s;t in Starving them, and the like&mdash;. This was an Argument &s;o plea&s;ing, and &s;o much Improved without Doors, that it made the Oppo&s;ers of the Union grow popular, and &s;eem as if they were but meer Advocates for the Poor; That they were now really De|fending their Country, which the Commi&s;&s;ioners had aban|doned, and &s;hewed, that the Concern for the Burdening
<PB N="141" REF="428">
<HI>Scotland</HI> with unrea&s;onable Exactions had not been part of their Bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;; Great Hopes therefore were conceived from this Debate by &s;ome People, who had the De&s;truction of the Treaty chiefly in their Eyes, for as the Struggle had not been &s;mall in <HI>England,</HI> to obtain an Exemption from the Salt Tax to <HI>Scotland</HI> for Seven Years, it was more than probable, That, if a perpetual Exemption was in&s;i&s;ted on, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parlia|ment would refu&s;e it, and &s;o the Union might &s;plit upon that Rock; which being &s;o &s;pecious, and &s;eeming to be all done in meer Concern for the Poor of <HI>Scotland,</HI> would there|fore engage all the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> in Defence of it&mdash;; But this Cloud vani&s;h'd afterward, tho' at fir&s;t it look'd black enough.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XLIV.</HEAD>
<P>The Debate of the la&s;t Day being Renewed, occa&s;ioned &s;ome Warmth in the Hou&s;e, and great Arguings there were about the Poor in <HI>Scotland</HI> being Unable to pay the Tax upon Salt at all, and that therefore they ought not to be left to the Mercy of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament; the Matters al&s;o of the Di&s;proportion in the Duties to the Value in the re&s;pective Kingdoms, was al&s;o made a &s;trong Motive again&s;t the Duty being laid upon the <HI>Scots,</HI> as a plain Inequality, &s;ince, as the Duty on Salt lay then, being Taxed by Weight, the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;hould pay Sixteen Shillings Four Pence upon what in their Country yielded <HI>exclu&s;ive</HI> of the Duty but Three Shillings; Whereas the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hould pay no more on the Value of Ten Shillings Six Pence, which was a great Di&s;parity in the Taxation by Value&mdash;. But to this it was An&s;wered, If the Bulk or Quantity of Salt was equal, and <HI>Scotland</HI> having their Salt made ju&s;t where it was Expended, had, or could buy as much for Three Shillings, as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had, or could buy for Ten Shillings Six Pence, the Weight of the Salt being the &s;ame, they were &s;o much the better able to pay Sixteen Shillings Four Pence on that Quantity of Salt in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by how much it was had Cheaper by Seven Shil|lings Six Pence in its fir&s;t Co&s;t, than the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were, who were obliged to pay Seven Shillings Six Pence for the &s;ame Quantity in its fir&s;t Co&s;t, than the <HI>Scots</HI> payed.</P>
<P>To this again was Objected, the Poverty of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Difference this made in the Price of Salt to the Poor, how nece&s;&s;ary the Salt was to the Sub&s;i&s;tence of the Poor, and how much it would rai&s;e the Price, to the General Di&s;cou|ragement and Impoveri&s;hing the Labouring part of the Peo|ple, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Duties being very near one Penny <HI>per</HI> Pound <HI>&s;terling</HI> upon the Salt, mo&s;t of which Duty would ly on tho&s;e who were lea&s;t able to bear it; And this, as I Noted before, made the Argument become popular, and the Oppo&s;ers of the Union began to be counted Patriots, who &s;trove meerly for the &s;ecuring their Country from Unrea&s;onable and In&s;up|portable Taxes.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to Note here, <HI>in order to let the Reader in|to a true &s;tate of this Que&s;tion,</HI> what the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Duties on Salt were, which were thus &s;trenuou&s;ly Argued again&s;t&mdash;, they were in &s;hort thus.<LIST>
<ITEM>Twelve Pence <HI>per</HI> Bu&s;hel on Salt, each Bu&s;hel to Weigh Fifty Six Pound <HI>Aver du Pois</HI> Weight, granted by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament <HI>Anno</HI> 5^o <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> appro|priated to the year 1710.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Twenty Eight Pence <HI>per</HI> Bu&s;hel, Weighing as above,
<PB N="144" REF="431">
granted 9<HI>th</HI> King <HI>William,</HI> and appropriated for the payment of Annuities Redeemable by Parliament.</ITEM>
</LIST> As may more at large be &s;een in the Appendix.</P>
<P>The Treaters at <HI>London</HI> had agreed on both Hands, to Exempt <HI>Scotland</HI> from the whole Tax upon Salt for &s;even Years as appears in the Ob&s;ervations on the Minutes of the Eighth Article in that Treaty&mdash;, but had then left it&mdash;, with a Conce&s;&s;ion, that then <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould pay as <HI>England</HI> &s;hould pay at that Time&mdash;, only it was &s;uppo&s;ed, the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament would Con&s;ider, Whether <HI>Scotland</HI> was any bet|ter able to pay then than before&mdash;, according to that Clau&s;e added in the Fourteenth Article, <HI>viz. That it could not be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>would ever lay any &s;orts of Burdens upon the &V;nited Kingdom, but what they &s;hould find of Nece&s;&s;ity at that time, for the Pre&s;ervation and Good of the whole&mdash;, and with due Regard to</HI> the Circum&s;tan|ces and Abilities <HI>of every part of the &V;nited Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>But it was again alledged, That the Words in this Eighth Article, <HI>viz. But from the Expiration of the &s;aid &s;even years,</HI> Scotland <HI>&s;hall be lyable to the &s;ame Duties for Salt made in</HI> Scot|land, <HI>as &s;hall be then payable for Salt made in</HI> England, <HI>Vide</HI> the Treaty at <HI>London</HI> Article VIII. <HI>Page</HI> 5<HI>th.</HI> Obliged the <HI>Scots</HI> to the payment, and put it out of the Power of the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> to Alter it; and that therefore the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> ought to take effectual Care to prevent it, and to &s;ecure the People of Scotland again&s;t it.</P>
<P>There were a great many Speeches made on this Subject, and &s;omething Har&s;h enough pa&s;t on both &s;ides, which I care not to Relate&mdash;, for the &s;akes of the Gentlemen that &s;hewed them&s;elves a little out of Temper here&mdash;; But at length a <HI>Medium</HI> was propo&s;ed in the Terms <HI>of the fir&s;t Clau&s;e of the Mi|nute,</HI> which Exempted <HI>Scotland</HI> from the Two Shillings Four Pence <HI>per</HI> Bu&s;hel, mentioned above, and appropriated to the Ea&s;t <HI>India</HI> Company, and let the Twelve Pence <HI>per</HI> Bu&s;hel &s;tand, as a Thing not of &s;o much Con&s;equence, 1. Becau&s;e the Sum was not &s;o con&s;iderable, as to make it In&s;upportable to the Poor. 2. It was not appropriated to any payment fur|ther than to the year 1710, and &s;o might Determine in a &s;hort Time; Whereas the Two Shillings Four Pence <HI>per</HI> Bu&s;hel, was actually &s;ettled as a Fund for payment of Annuities for Ninety Nine Years, and mu&s;t certainly fall upon <HI>Scotland</HI> at the end of &s;even Years.</P>
<P>This &s;eemed a very rea&s;onable Propo&s;al, tho' it did not an&s;wer the End of the&s;e Gentlemen, who&s;e Aim, as I Hinted before, was at the Treaty in General&mdash;. For it was a Mode|rating between both, bearing a part which they could bear,
<PB N="145" REF="432">
and yet taking off that part which the Poor were &s;aid to be pinch'd by, and which they pretended would effectually have rai&s;ed a National Di&s;content.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen on the other &s;ide, were a little &s;ilenced with this Propo&s;al&mdash;; they at fir&s;t indeed po&s;itively in&s;i&s;ted, as in the D. of <HI>A&mdash;ls</HI> Prote&s;t, That <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould be for ever free <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of all Duties on Salt&mdash;, but they were &s;ubdued by the Rea&s;onings of the other Gentlemen, upon the Equity of the above Propo&s;al, and unle&s;s, as in General, objecting again&s;t the whole Treaty, there was no with&s;tanding it&mdash;; yet after &s;ome Debating, there was found an Exception to this too, and that was, That tho' the Two Shillings four Pence was thus provided again&s;t, it was but a &s;ingle Term, and the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> might &s;et that Duty a&s;ide, and lay &s;ome other Tax on in the Room of it, which might be the &s;ame thing, or wor&s;e, and &s;o this Exemption might be Eluded, and this they called without Doors, <HI>a De&s;ign to Trepan</HI> Scotland, <HI>or draw her into the &s;nare of the Duty, under the pretence of an Exemption.</HI></P>
<P>But this was &s;oon Warded again&s;t, and the latter part of the Clau&s;e effectually &s;topt that Gap, <HI>viz. That if the Parlia|ment of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>&s;hall at, or before the Expiring of the &s;aid &s;even years, &s;ub&s;titute any other Fund in the place of the &s;aid Two Shillings Four Pence of Exci&s;e on the Bu&s;hel of Home Salt&mdash;,</HI> Scotland <HI>&s;hall after the &s;aid &s;even years, bear a proportion of the &s;aid Fund,</HI> but <HI>&s;hall have an Equivalent in the Terms of the Treaty,</HI> that is in the Terms of the Fourteenth Article, which &s;ays, That <HI>Scotland &s;hall have an Equivalent for what the Subjects thereof &s;hall be Charged towards payment of the Debts of</HI> England, <HI>in all particulars what&s;oever,</HI> Vide Treaty at <HI>Lon|don</HI> Art. 15. <HI>Pag.</HI> 9.</P>
<P>This brought the Matter of Debate to an End, and there was nothing left but to put the Vote&mdash;, the other Party of|fered a Clau&s;e of General and Ab&s;olute Exemption, as <HI>per</HI> the Minute&mdash;; but it was Voted not to be the &s;tate of the Que|&s;tion, &s;o the Affair ended with the D. of <HI>A&mdash;ls</HI> Prote&s;t, as <HI>per</HI> the Minute.</P>
<P>Yet it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, That this &s;tep taken by the Par|liament, went a great way to &s;top the Mouths of the People, who began to be &s;trangely Allarm'd at the Apprehen&s;ions of the Salt Duty, which was cryed out upon as In&s;upportable,; but their being wholly Exempted from it for &s;even years, and for ever Exempt from all but Twelve Pence <HI>per</HI> Bu&s;hel, the Burden was both le&s;&s;ened in the Main, and Remote in pro|&s;pect, and &s;o the General Clamour wore off.</P>
<P>It was indeed a great Abatement to that Article as &s;tated at <HI>London,</HI> and &s;ome People flattered them&s;elves with the Hopes, that it would occa&s;ion &s;ome Debates in the Parliament in <HI>England,</HI> and perhaps &s;uffer &s;ome Alterations there, which
<PB N="146" REF="433">
might occa&s;ion the Returning the whole to <HI>Scotland</HI> again&mdash;; But that View proved Fictitious, and the Gentlemen found them&s;elves di&s;appointed.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XLV.</HEAD>
<P>The Eighth Article was now pa&s;&s;ed without any more De|bates, the Amendments were all Read, being put together, and as the Hou&s;e had Ordered, Tran&s;cribed into Form, as you will find them in the Treaty, Printed in the <HI>Appendix.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="434">
And now we are come to the great Article of the Equiva|lent, which has of it &s;elf made more Noi&s;e in the World, than all the other Articles; and which, tho' in it &s;elf founded upon the highe&s;t Ju&s;tice to <HI>Scotland,</HI> being the only Mean to bring the Di&s;cording Circum&s;tances of the Nations to Unite, and was &s;tated with the greate&s;t Exactne&s;s, and the nice&s;t and mo&s;t unexceptionable Calculations, that the Wit of Man could perform; yet it met with the greate&s;t Oppo&s;ition, and was Treated with the mo&s;t Contempt in <HI>Scotland</HI> of any other part of the Union; Nay to that Degree, that, when the very Money it &s;elf came to be brought into <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Common People were excited to that Height, as to call it the Price of their Country, and to In&s;ult the very People that brought it.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t therefore be excu&s;ed, if the Ob&s;ervations on this Point exceed the Bounds of that Brevity I at fir&s;t propo&s;ed to my &s;elf, and that I endeavour to be as particular as po&s;|&s;ible upon this Head.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Clau&s;e of this Article had been Voted and Agreed to, not without a great Struggle in the Parliament, on the Seventh of the &s;ame Month of <HI>December,</HI> as <HI>per</HI> the Ob&s;erva|tions upon the Minutes of that Day appears, to which I re|fer, and the remaining part of the Article was adjourned till the Reports of the Committee appointed to con&s;ider of the Sixth and Eighth Articles were received and con&s;idered, which being now ended, the Hou&s;e proceeded to the &s;ub&s;equent Articles.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t Clau&s;e of the Article was the main Prelimi|nary to the re&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould be oblig|ed to come in to the appropriated Duties of <HI>England,</HI> and con&s;equently have her Revenues appropriated to the payment of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Debts, receiving from <HI>Eng|land</HI> an Equivalent&mdash;; What that Equivalent &s;hould be, <HI>viz. Ready Money?</HI> How much it &s;hould be, <HI>viz.</HI> Three Hundred Ninety Eight Thou&s;and Eighty Five Pounds Ten Shillings&mdash;? And whether that Sum was rightly calculated? All this was determined as above.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Clau&s;e which came now to be debated was thus, <HI>And in regard, That, after the &V;nion,</HI> Scotland <HI>becoming liable to the &s;ame Cu&s;toms and Duties payable on Import and Ex|port, and to the &s;ame Exci&s;es on all Exci&s;eable Liquors as in</HI> England, <HI>as well upon that Account as upon the Account of the Encrea&s;e of Trade and People, (which will be the Happy Con&s;e|quence of the &V;nion) The &s;aid Revenues will much improve be|yond the before mentioned Annual Values thereof, of which no pre&s;ent E&s;timate can be made; Yet neverthele&s;s, for the Rea&s;ons afore&s;aid, there ought to be a proportionable Equivalent an&s;wered to</HI> Scotland; It is agreed, <HI>That, after the &V;nion, there &s;hall</HI>
<PB N="148" REF="435">
<HI>be an Account kept of the &s;aid Duties ari&s;ing in</HI> Scotland, <HI>to the end it may appear, what ought to be An&s;wer'd to</HI> Scotland, <HI>as an Equivalent for &s;uch Proportion of the &s;aid Encrea&s;e, as &s;hall be applicable to the Payment of the Debts of</HI> England.</P>
<P>This was only to oblige the Per&s;ons appointed by the Go|vernment to direct the Trea&s;ury of <HI>Britain,</HI> That an exact Account might be kept, what part of the Revenue of <HI>Scot|land</HI> was to be appropriate, and for which the Equivalent was to be rai&s;ed, in order al&s;o to come to a Certainty in the Mea&s;ures which were to be taken with the Remainder&mdash;; And therefore this needed little Debate, yet it will occa&s;ion a further Remark pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>The Third Clau&s;e runs thus, <HI>And for the further and more effectual an&s;wering the &s;everal Ends hereafter mentioned,</HI> it is a|greed, <HI>That, from and after the &V;nion, the whole Encrea&s;e of the Revenues of Cu&s;toms, and Duties on Import and Export, and Exci&s;e upon Exci&s;eable Liquors in</HI> Scotland, <HI>over and above the Annual Produce of the &s;aid re&s;pective Duties, as above &s;tated, &s;hall go and be apply'd, for the Term of Seven Years, to the &V;&s;es here|after mentioned.</HI></P>
<P>This was a general Referring al&s;o to the Particulars, to which the Overplus of the Revenue of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould be ap|plyed, and this will al&s;o come to be di&s;cour&s;ed of in its place, being here pa&s;s'd of Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The Fourth Clau&s;e was, <HI>And that, upon the &s;aid Account, there &s;hall be an&s;wered to</HI> Scotland <HI>Annually, from the end of Seven Years after the &V;nion, an Equivalent in Proportion to &s;uch Part of the &s;aid Encrea&s;e, as &s;hall be applicable to the Debts of</HI> England.</P>
<P>This Clau&s;e could admit no Debate on the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;ide, &s;ince, as they had agreed, by the fir&s;t Clau&s;e, to come into an Equality of Duties, this was Capitulating in behalf of <HI>Scotland,</HI> That an Equivalent &s;hould be paid by <HI>England</HI> for &s;o much of the Revenues of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as &s;hould be applyed to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Debts, over and above what had been already &s;tated in the Equivalent named in the former Clau&s;e.</P>
<P>And here I &s;hall take the Freedom to quote what the for|mer Gentleman I quoted before gave <HI>as his Opinion</HI> on this very Head, I mean Mr. Baron <HI>Clark,</HI> who&s;e Judgment I think I may be allowed to appeal to, and who was a Witne&s;s to, and pre&s;ent in Parliament at all the&s;e Debates. <HI>See his E&s;&s;ay on the</HI> 15<HI>th. Article of the &V;nion, Pag.</HI> 13<HI>th.</HI> in the&s;e Words&mdash;<Q><P>2. That which is mo&s;t Remarkable in this whole Ar|ticle, and particularly to be taken Notice of, is this, <HI>viz.</HI> That, from the Commencement of the <HI>Union,</HI> the whole Increa&s;e of the Revenues of <HI>Cu&s;toms and Duties</HI> on Im|port and Export, and <HI>Exci&s;e</HI> upon <HI>Exci&s;eable Liquors,</HI> over and above the Annual Produce of the &s;aid re&s;pective Duties, as above &s;tated, &s;hall be applyed for the Term of

Seven Years, to the U&s;e and Advantage of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Meaning whereof is hereby Illu&s;trated.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e, the <HI>Cu&s;toms</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> after the Union, <HI>(what upon the Account of a greater Trade, or upon the Account of taking upon us the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Cu&s;toms)</HI> &s;hould increa&s;e to 80000 Pounds <HI>Sterling, which I believe no Trading Man will doubt of;</HI> then 'tis plain, that in regard there's an Increa&s;e of the&s;e Cu&s;toms of 50000 Pounds above the pre&s;ent Extent, therefore that Increa&s;e is by this Paragraph allowed to <HI>Scotland</HI> yearly, for the fore&s;aid <HI>Term</HI> of Seven Years, <HI>which will be a great Encouragement to</HI> Scotland, <HI>and by Con&s;equence an Advantage to the whole</HI> I&s;land; <HI>&s;ince 'tis not to be doubted, but &s;uch an</HI> Annual Sum <HI>of</HI> 50000 Pounds <HI>will be imployed during that time, towards &s;uch Ends and U&s;es as will be mo&s;t for the Honour and Advantage of this Poor Country.</HI></P>
<P>&V;pon this Conce&s;&s;ion of the Increa&s;e of <HI>Cu&s;toms and Ex|ci&s;es</HI> for Seven Years, 'tis likewi&s;e to be ob&s;erved, That the Sum of 22874 Pounds that falls at <HI>September</HI> 1710 above|mentioned, will likewi&s;e go for the Remainder of the Term of Seven Years, after the &V;nion, towards the behoof of <HI>Scotland,</HI> if &s;o be that the Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;es that rai&s;e that Sum are continued, and not appropriated for other &V;&s;es.</P>
<P N="3">3 From the la&s;t part of the Paragraph, 'tis to be ob&s;erv|ed, That there &s;hall be an&s;wered to <HI>Scotland</HI> Annually, af|ter the Expiration of the fore&s;aid Term of Seven Years, an <HI>Equivalent</HI> in Proportion to &s;uch parts of the Increa&s;e as &s;hall be applyed towards Payment of the Debts of <HI>England.</HI> For Explaining of which, it may be ob&s;erved,</P>

<P>This la&s;t Article of the Accompt is very Remarkable, ex|tending to no le&s;s than a Sum of 71287 Pounds to be appli|cable towards the Debts contracted before the &V;nion. But this needs not amu&s;e any Per&s;on: For in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, it was &s;uppo&s;ed, if there be a Peace concluded, and &s;o an end put to the pre&s;ent <HI>War,</HI> then will the Debts of <HI>England</HI> be in a few Years fully payed. The Con&s;equence of which will be, That the Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;es, which after the &V;nion, 
<PB N="150" REF="437">
will be payable by the Subjects of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> &s;hall then be intirely taken off and let fall. In the <HI>next</HI> place, Tho' the &s;aid Sum of 71287 Pounds be applicable yearly towards the Payment of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Debts; yet there &s;hall be an Annual <HI>Equivalent</HI> given by <HI>England</HI> to the Extent of that Sum. Which leads us to con&s;ider a <HI>Que&s;tion,</HI> Whe|ther or not that Sum of 71287 Pounds will be &s;ent up yearly to <HI>England</HI> for paying the&s;e Debts? I <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> No, for if it &s;hould, then, by the Nature of the Equivalents, that very Sum behoved to be &s;ent back to us again, which is a certain needle&s;s Trouble; and Lawyers, when they intend to amu&s;e their Clients with &s;peaking a &s;ort of La|tine; have this in their Mouths, applicable enough to this Purpo&s;e, <HI>Fru&s;tra petitur quod mox e&s;t re&s;tituendum.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore any Man may &s;ee, that this Sum is not to be &s;ent to <HI>England,</HI> but mu&s;t remain among us.</P>
<P>Could it ever have entered into the Heads of Men, in their right Wits, to burden a Poor Nation with an An|nual Payment of a great Sum, for Debts they never con|tracted, without at the &s;ame time allowing a Re-imbur&s;e|ment to them? And if &s;o, can we imagine, that Matters will be &s;o confounded, as that they mu&s;t &s;end yearly great Sums out of <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> for no other End, than immediately to be returned back again? This is &s;o ridicu|lous, that 'tis &s;carcely to be &s;poken of.</P></Q></P>
<P>Thus far Mr. Baron <HI>Clark,</HI> to which I &s;hall add nothing, but that his Rea&s;onings were &s;o plain, that they needed no Explication&mdash;</P>
<P>The Fifth Clau&s;e was thus, <HI>And whereas, from the Expira|tion of Seven Years after the &V;nion,</HI> Scotland <HI>is to be lyable to the &s;ame Duties for Salt made in</HI> Scotland, <HI>as &s;hall be then pay|able for Salt made in</HI> England; It is agreed, <HI>That, when &s;uch Duties take place there, an Equivalent &s;hall be An&s;wered to</HI> Scot|land <HI>for &s;uch Part thereof, as &s;hall be apply'd towards payment of the Debts of</HI> England; <HI>Of which Duties an Account &s;hall be kept, to the end it may appear, what is to be An&s;wered to</HI> Scot|land <HI>as the &s;aid Equivalent.</HI></P>
<P>This required only to be left out as being u&s;ele&s;s, &s;ince the Affair of the Salt was &s;ettled otherways in the prece|dent Days Vote; So that hitherto the&s;e were all Negative Clau&s;es in the Main.</P>
<P>The Sixth Clau&s;e was, <HI>And generally, That an Equivalent &s;hall be An&s;wered to</HI> Scotland <HI>for &s;uch Parts of the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Debts, as</HI> Scotland <HI>may hereafter become lyable to pay by Rea&s;on of the &V;nion, other than &s;uch for which Appropriations have been made by Parliament in</HI> England <HI>of the Cu&s;toms, or other Duties on Ex|port and Import, Exci&s;es on all Exci&s;eable Liquors or Salt, in Re&s;pect of which Debts, Equivalents are herein before provided.</HI></P>
<P>The Oppo&s;ition made to this Article was on the &s;ame Foot as the Oppo&s;ition made to the fir&s;t Clau&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> That they
<PB N="151" REF="438">
would not have <HI>Scotland</HI> come into the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Debts at all, but having con&s;ented to come in as far as the Equivalent ex|tended, they were for making a Stop there&mdash;; But this was found Impracticable, after the Duties which were to be paid by <HI>Scotland</HI> were a&s;&s;ented to, to have turned them from the Channel of Appropriation which the like Duties in <HI>Eng|land</HI> were appointed to run in by Act of Parliament, could not well be done, &s;o after a &s;hort Di&s;pute about the Po&s;&s;ibi|lity of this, it was pa&s;s'd over al&s;o.</P>
<P>They now came to the Debate of the Application of the Equivalent, but this was too long a Subject to enter upon that Day, &s;o it was adjourned to the next Time&mdash;.</P>

<P>The Lord Chancellor acquainted the Parliament, That notwith|&s;tanding, the &s;everal Addre&s;&s;es brought in, and pre&s;ented to the Parliament, <HI>Again&s;t an Incorporating &V;nion with</HI> England, <HI>in the Terms of the Articles,</HI> have been under due Con&s;ideration, during the whole Procedure, upon the <HI>Articles of &V;nion:</HI> Yet there is now Information, that <HI>Letters</HI> are &s;ent through &s;everal Corners of the Kingdom, De&s;iring the Sub&s;crivers of the&s;e <HI>Addre&s;&s;es,</HI> to come in and A&s;&s;emble at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> upon pretence of waiting the Effect of the &s;aid <HI>Addre&s;&s;es,</HI> and of knowing what Return the Parliament will give them.

<P>Her Maje&s;ties High Commi&s;&s;ioner, was plea&s;ed to &s;ignifie to the Parliament, That he had Information from &s;everal Corners of the Kingdom, of the great Pains and Methods, which had been u&s;ed to procure Sub&s;criptions to <HI>Addre&s;&s;es,</HI> and to call in to <HI>Edinburgh</HI> the Sub&s;cribers, again&s;t a preci&s;e Day to back the&s;e <HI>Addre&s;&s;es.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XLVI.</HEAD>
<P>The Work of this Day Explains it &s;elf&mdash;, and needs but little Remark; This was a new &s;hift, if po&s;&s;ible, to have Di|verted the Parliament from going on with the great Work of the Union, Tumults and Riots in the Country had been tryed in Vain, and the <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> Rabblers were clo&s;s in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> Mobs and Rabbles in the Streets had been &s;uppre&s;t, and the Guards did con&s;tant Duty in the City, walked the Rounds in the Night, and kept the Streets quiet, the Meeting of the Heretors and Fencible Men, had been Di&s;|charged by Proclamation, and the Clau&s;e in the <HI>Act of Security,</HI> Licen&s;ing them to do &s;o, had been Repealed; So that now no Room was left for violent Methods, except by open and actual Rebellion, and that had all po&s;&s;ible provi&s;ion made for it in the Laws, and the Queen had Ordered Troops to the Borders of <HI>England,</HI> as is before Noted, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t and &s;upport the Government, in ca&s;e of Nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="440">
The only Pretence therefore now, was this, The Ad|dre&s;&s;es, as you will Read in the Minutes, had been continually brought in again&s;t the Union from all parts of the Kingdom, An&s;wers were not given, nor expected to be given by the Parliament, but they lay before the Parliament for their Con&s;ideration; and an Addre&s;s lying before the Parliament, is, by the Nature of the Thing, &s;uppo&s;ed to be under Con|&s;ideration&mdash;; But the Addre&s;&s;ers pretending, That no Re|gard was had to their Addre&s;&s;es, pretend now to come all up to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> to wait for, or rather to Demand An&s;wers to their Addre&s;&s;es&mdash;; This was too bare faced a Pretence not to di&s;cover its own Meaning; And therefore the Parliament immediately agreed to the Proclamation, to Di&s;charge or Forbid all &s;uch Gatherings or Meetings of the Subjects, as Unwarrantable and contrair to Law. See the Proclamation in the <HI>Appendix N^o.</HI> B x x.</P>
<P>You will ob&s;erve, That on &s;everal Occa&s;ions after the fir&s;t Pro|po&s;al of Printing the Names of &s;uch as Voted on either &s;ide, the like Li&s;t of Names was Ordered to be made publick&mdash;, it would have been too long to have &s;ubjoyned the&s;e to every Vote&mdash;, and al&s;o been Trouble&s;ome and U&s;ele&s;s to the Reader&mdash;; But this Ca&s;e being &s;omething &s;ingular, I have put the Names of the Members as they were Printed by Order of Parliament, in the Appendix of this Work, marked with this Mark D x x, by which &s;ome gue&s;s may be made, who Encouraged or Di&s;couraged the Violences of tho&s;e Times, and what Encouragement were &s;ugge&s;ted to tho&s;e without, from the Proceedings and Conduct of tho&s;e within.</P>
<P>It was expected by &s;ome People, That the&s;e Tumults &s;hould have had great Encouragement on the part of the Church; and great pains were taken to draw in the Mini&s;ters in &s;everal parts, to E&s;pou&s;e the Quarrel, and to appear with the People again&s;t the Union.</P>
<P>But the Mini&s;ters, however they &s;hewed them&s;elves again&s;t the Union in General, and again&s;t the &s;everal Particulars as they concerned them, yet they &s;hewed no Inclination to Encourage the Tumultary Methods, that the Violent Tempers of other People, &s;eemed to be precipitating the Nation into; and therefore the Letter written by the Commi&s;&s;ion to the &s;everal Presbyteries, was very &s;ea&s;onable, not only to prevent the Mi&s;chiefs Threatning the Peace of the Kingdom at that Time, but al&s;o to Vindicate the Commi&s;&s;ion of the A&s;&s;embly from the A&s;per&s;ions rai&s;ed upon them from the above Sup|po&s;ition, Copy of which I have in&s;erted in the <HI>Appendix,</HI> with the An&s;wer of the Presbytery of <HI>Hamilton</HI> to it N^o.

<P>It would have been endle&s;s to have added here, the par|ticular Addre&s;&s;es which were pre&s;ented from the &s;everal parts of the Kingdom, however, &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;ignificant I

From the&s;e Ad|dre&s;&s;es, the Bulk of the re&s;t may be gue&s;&s;ed at; Only it may be Noted, there were but three Presbyteries in the whole Kingdom that Addre&s;&s;ed at all, viz. <HI>Lanerk, Hamiltoun</HI> and <HI>Dumblain,</HI> there being Sixty Eight Presbyteries in the whole.</P>

<P>Upon this part of the Application of the Equivalent, great Stir was made, on pretence of pre&s;erving the <HI>African</HI> Com|pany, and &s;ome Papers were offered to the Parliament.</P>
<P>The Company made a long Repre&s;entation to the Parli|ament, needle&s;s to be in&s;erted here&mdash;.</P>
<P>There were a Party who pretended to &s;truggle, <HI>and &s;ome Motions appeared in the Hou&s;e to that purpo&s;e,</HI> again&s;t the Di&s;|&s;olving the <HI>African</HI> Company; It is confe&s;t, the Company was a Thing the Nation had a great Concern in, almo&s;t every con&s;iderable Family in the Kingdom having &s;ome &s;hare in the Stock, and con&s;equently in the Lo&s;s, for it was reck|oned no better: The Hi&s;torical part of that Tran&s;action does not relate to this place, but it may be proper to &s;ay a little to it, to introduce the true under&s;tanding of the Vote.</P>
<P>The Company had been Erected upon a General Sub&s;crip|tion of 600000 <HI>lib. &s;terling,</HI> mo&s;t of it &s;ub&s;cribed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> upon which every Sub&s;criber had paid down a certain part of the Sum &s;ub&s;cribed, and was lyable at the Call of the Com|pany, to be pur&s;ued for the Remainder, and to pay it all in, as by the &s;everal Acts of Parliament, &s;ettling and confirming the &s;aid Company, will appear.</P>
<P>Upon the Mi&s;carriage of the Expedition to <HI>Daricn,</HI> and the Return of their Ships, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Company was &s;o Di&s;cou|raged and Di&s;heartned, that no new Attempt either there, or any where el&s;e, had been &s;o much as Talked of, nor were any other Payments demanded, the Lo&s;s of what was already Expended lying very heavy upon the Nation, and parti|cularly upon &s;ome Families who could very ill bear it.</P>
<P>The De&s;ign had &s;o effectually Mi&s;carried, that the Stock advanc'd was not only Expended, but the Company was brought very low, and was very far in Debt upon the ac|count of their &s;aid Expedition to <HI>Darien</HI>&mdash;, and the Sub|&s;cribers were always apprehen&s;ive of a Call upon them of &s;ome further payment, to di&s;charge the Remainder due on the old Voyage, or perhaps to Form &s;ome new Expedition, and this made &s;ome People &s;o Unea&s;ie, that they &s;old their Stock in the &s;aid Company for Trifles, <HI>only to be &s;ecured again&s;t further Demands;</HI> In General, the Intere&s;t in the &s;aid Stock was come to &s;o low an Ebb, that People valued them|&s;elves little or nothing upon their Shares in it, and when the fir&s;t View of the Union came on, and &s;ome thought one way

of it, &s;ome another, they either Bought or Sold as their Opi|nion of the Union, and its pro&s;pect of Succe&s;s either increa&s;ed or decrea&s;ed; and indeed the publick Expectation of the Succe&s;s of the Union ran very low at this Time, as may be &s;uppo&s;ed, from the Value now put on the Stock of the <HI>African</HI> Company, which was fallen &s;o low, that &s;everal People offered to Sell their whole Intere&s;t for 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> on the Ori|ginal Stock, tho' at the &s;ame time they &s;aw, that if the Uni|on took place, the whole principal Money with Intere&s;t was to be repaid them.</P>
<P>There &s;eemed to be abundance of Difficulties in the way of the Treaty; he Fury of the Rabbles, the Tumults in the Streets, the Strength of the Oppo&s;ition, and the abundance of Debates they were yet to go thro', gave &s;o mean a pro&s;pect of the Union, that tho' it was an Article in the Treaty, that when it was Fini&s;hed, all the Stock of the <HI>African</HI> Company &s;hould be repaid with Intere&s;t, as above, <HI>out of the Equivalent Money,</HI> yet no Body Valued them&s;elves upon it then, nor were any very fond of Buying, tho' the Demand was extravagantly low; and indeed &s;o low as told every one, the Sellers look|ed upon it as a de&s;parate Ca&s;e, that they had no Dependance upon, and very little Expectation from</P>
<P>It was expected there &s;hould have been a Debate upon the previous Que&s;tion, Whether the <HI>African</HI> Company &s;hould be Di&s;&s;olved or no, and as <HI>per</HI> the Vote, it was propo&s;ed to hear Lawyers or Coun&s;el in behalf of the Company, but it was apparent, this al&s;o was a Propo&s;al not &s;o much in behalf of the Company, as in order to put a full &s;top to the Uni|on, &s;ince it was evident, two Companies could not be con|&s;i&s;tent in <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>Nor was it alledged, That the Proprietors of the Company had it been put to the Que&s;tion, would have de&s;ired the Com|pany to continue, and &s;o have Disbur&s;ed further Sums to carry on their Trade, in hope of making up and recovering their Money; and this rather than have received their prin|cipal Sums with Intere&s;t back again, which was a Thing they had no rea&s;on to expect.</P>
<P>The Propo&s;al therefore was rejected, not that every Mans Con&s;ent in his own private Right was not acknowledged to be needful&mdash;; But this being a publick Act granted by Parliament, the Parliament fir&s;t &s;ecuring every Man his whole Principal and Intere&s;t, from the very time of payment, had undoubtedly a Power to Re&s;cind their own Act, and cau&s;e cea&s;e all the Powers and Privileges which derived from them.</P>
<P>Upon this Foot, it was thought ju&s;t to Repeal the Acts E&s;tabli&s;hing the Company, even without hearing their Lawyers, or demanding their A&s;&s;ent&mdash;. Again, had the A&s;&s;ent been demanded, it ought to have been not an A&s;&s;ent
<PB N="158" REF="445">
of the Directors or Council, but of every Proprietor, which, as it might have been Difficult, and perhaps Impo&s;&s;ible, would have effectually an&s;wered the End of tho&s;e Gentlemen, who &s;ought to bring the&s;e Matters to a Head of Debate, and &s;o have wrought out of them the wi&s;hed for Delay to the <HI>&V;nion</HI> then in hand.</P>
<P>Some al&s;o alledged this Ca&s;e as parallel to the great Ca&s;e now depending, and would have argued the la&s;t from the con&s;equence of the fir&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> That as the Company could not be Di&s;&s;olved by the Con&s;ent of the Directors, or Council, or Managers of their Affairs, but by the univer&s;al Con&s;ent of the whole Body of Sub&s;cribers; &s;o neither could the Con&s;ti|tution of <HI>Scotland</HI> be Altered by the Act and Deed of the Repre&s;entative, without the Concurrence and A&s;&s;ent of the Con&s;tituents from whom the Repre&s;entatives derived&mdash;. But this &s;eeming parallel appeared to be Imperfect, and con|&s;equently to be no parallel at all, &s;ince the Company could at any time be legally Di&s;&s;olved, and their Charters, Privi|leges, and Powers be made to cea&s;e, by the &s;ame Power that made them, without asking the A&s;&s;ent either of the Directors or Sub&s;cribers; <HI>That is,</HI> without Con&s;ulting the Repre&s;enta|tive or Con&s;tituent, Parts of that Body, and the Power &s;o Di&s;&s;olving, or taking away the &s;aid Company, had no other Obligation upon them, than in Ju&s;tice to make good all Damage or Detriment to private Per&s;ons; and this was effectually done.</P>
<P>The Fate of the <HI>African</HI> Company of <HI>Scotland</HI> being thus Determined, the further Application of the Equivalent was the next Work&mdash;; and there &s;eemed only two Things to call immediately for help.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Coin, which of Nece&s;&s;ity required a new Re|gulation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The publick Debts of the Nation, which called loudly to be Di&s;charged.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Coin was agreed to be the fir&s;t Con&s;ideration, and as <HI>per</HI> the Minute appears, was unanimou&s;ly agreed to&mdash;, the &s;tate of which was in &s;hort thus;</P>
<P>By the lowne&s;s of the Coin in <HI>Scotland,</HI> both as to Quali|ty and Quantity, I mean the Old Money, <HI>Scotland</HI> came un|der this General Di&s;advantage, <HI>viz.</HI> That almo&s;t every Foreign Coin pa&s;t current in <HI>Scotland</HI> to advantage: For Example&mdash;, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Shilling pa&s;t at Thirteen Pence, the <HI>French</HI> Crown which in <HI>London</HI> goes at Four Shillings Six Pence, pa&s;t at Five Shillings, the <HI>Dutch</HI> Dollar at Fifty Eight Pence, the Bank Dollar, and Three other &s;orts commonly called the Wild-Hor&s;e, the Wild-Man, and Ca&s;tle, being generally Im|perial or Rex Dollars, were by Act of Council rai&s;ed to Sixty Pence.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="446">
This indeed had been occa&s;ioned by the Government in <HI>Scotland,</HI> formerly crying up their own Money above the u&s;ual Rate, a Thing always Fatal to the Nations that have thought fit to Venture upon it, and which Precipice <HI>England</HI> narrowly mi&s;s'd &s;plitting upon <HI>in the late Re&s;toration of her Coin,</HI> at which time, &s;ome People pu&s;h'd hard at rai&s;ing the Value of the Standart, not being aware of the National In|jury of Rai&s;ing the Value of Foreign <HI>Species,</HI> and &s;ubjecting the General Credit to a Lo&s;s on Exchange with all Nations of the World.</P>
<P>By the Union the Coin of <HI>Scotland</HI> was to be reduced, and brought to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Standart, the Con&s;equence of this was of nece&s;&s;ity, that there would be a Lo&s;s upon all the kinds of Money, both Foreign and Proper&mdash;; To cry down the Foreign Money, and bring it to a Value, could not be, becau&s;e the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Money being the Standart, was to be the only current Money, and all other Money would, as in <HI>England,</HI> go by Weight only; To &s;ink the Difference in the Hands of particular Per&s;ons, who had &s;uch Money in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, would have been a great Lo&s;s upon the poor People, and what they could not ea&s;ily bear&mdash;</P>
<P>The Advance upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Money, which was one Penny on every Shilling of the Silver, and Two Shillings Two Pence upon every Guinea, fell by the Cour&s;e of Things, that Money being to go current at the Rates as in <HI>England,</HI> and this was no &s;mall Lo&s;s to the People that had <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Money by them, but the Foreign and <HI>Scots</HI> Money being no more to be current, it was but rea&s;onable, that the Publick &s;hould defray the Charge, and make good the Lo&s;s, and therefore this was allotted out of the Equivalent.</P>
<P>Nor was that all, but as this was a Ca&s;e which admitted no Delay, &s;o it obtained the Preference of every Thing el&s;e, for till this was &s;ettled, the Circulation of Money would have been &s;topp'd, and a general Stagnation of Trade would have followed, and therefore it was appointed to be made good out of the Equivalent, before the <HI>African</HI> Company was refunded, and this &s;et the Mint quickly to Work, as will appear in its place.</P>
<P>The next thing to be paid out of the Equivalent was the Publick Debts, there were &s;ome who &s;truggled heartily to have the Debts of the Government come in before the Affair of the <HI>African</HI> Company, but it could not be carryed, tho&s;e Debts were not all a&s;certain'd, and the Claims were to be remitted to the Deci&s;ion of the Law, at lea&s;t many of them, and this would have left the <HI>African</HI> Affair to a long Uncer|tainty, which neither the Nature of the Thing, nor the Oc|ca&s;ion that Sub&s;cribers had for their Money could admit of&mdash;; For it is to be ob&s;erved by the Clau&s;e, That if the whole was not paid them within Twelve Months, they had
<PB N="160" REF="447">
Privilege to Trade, or give Licence to Trade, as if they were not to Di&s;&s;olve at all.</P>
<P>Next after the <HI>African</HI> Company therefore the Publick Debts came to be con&s;idered, and the Equivalent was appro|priated to the Di&s;charge of the &s;aid Debts; And if the pre|&s;ent Sum fell &s;hort, it was to be made good out of the grow|ing Cu&s;toms and Revenue of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which for Seven Years was to be appropriate for &s;uch U&s;es, as will hereafter appear.</P>
<P>The next in order was to be&s;tow this Money for the En|couragement of Trade, and fir&s;t the Wooll Ma&s;ters as they are called, that is the Gentlemen who&s;e E&s;tates were in the Sheep Countries, and who&s;e Rents were generally paid in Wooll, the&s;e made loud Complaints, that the Unions bringing upon them a Prohibition or Re&s;traint of the Exportation of Wooll, and there being no Con&s;umption by Manufacturing at Home, and their Wooll too cour&s;e for Sale in <HI>England,</HI> their E&s;tates would be vi&s;ibly &s;unk, and therefore that they ought to have &s;ome <HI>Equivalent</HI> al&s;o.</P>
<P>To this it was alledged, That the Exportation of Wooll, however obtained lately in <HI>Scotland,</HI> yet was grievous to the whole Nation, and ought to be re&s;trained by Law, as it was injurious to Trade, and that it u&s;ed in former Times to be re|&s;trained; that therefore if this was a pre&s;ent Lo&s;s to them, it was nothing but a reducing them to what they were be|fore, and taking away the Advantages they had made for a few Years out of the Publick Lo&s;&s;es: But however, That all Parties might, as far as po&s;&s;ible, be made &s;en&s;ible of the Equity and Ju&s;tice of the Union, a Con&s;ideration of 2000 Pounds <HI>Sterling per Annum</HI> was allowed to encourage &s;etting up &s;uch Manufactures in the&s;e places, as might imploy the Poor, and help forward the Con&s;umption of the Wooll in the Countries where it is grown&mdash;; How this 2000 Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> was di&s;po&s;ed, and what Effect it had on the Wooll, or on the Trade, I may Examine hereafter.</P>
<P>A Remainder after this is allotted to the Fi&s;hing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But the I&s;&s;ue of this al&s;o being not come to Knowledge at Writing of this Hi&s;tory, I can give no further Account of it.</P>
<P>As to the Affair of the Coin and of the <HI>African</HI> Compa|ny, the particulars were referr'd to the Committee, and we &s;hall meet with them again in their Cour&s;e, the Report of the &s;aid Committee being formed into an Act of Parliament, as will appear in its place&mdash;</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XLVIII.</HEAD>
<P>The Matter committed to the Committee here, was not whether the Coin &s;hould be reduc'd to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Standart, and be alike all over the I&s;land, for that every one &s;eemed to agree to, e&s;pecially after it had been agreed before, that the De&s;iciency &s;hould be made good out of the Equivalent&mdash;; But how, and in what manner the Deficiency of the Money &s;hould be made good, was the thing the Com|mittee was to con&s;ider&mdash;; And here, con|trary almo&s;t to the Hopes of the People, the Committee concluded, that the Deficiency even of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Money, <HI>viz.</HI> One Penny in each Shilling &s;hould be made good.</P>
<P>But here was a great Difficulty, and that was this, if it &s;hould be Voted, that no Con&s;ideration &s;hould be given for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Money, the People would be great Lo&s;ers, and the Article of making good the Lo&s;&s;es of the Coin would not be made good to them&mdash;; If the Deficiency was Voted, then the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would bring in va&s;t Sums of Money upon them to receive the Deficiency, and have it out in current Money, and &s;o carry it home again, and by this Trick, as &s;ome &s;ugge&s;ted, all the Equivalent might be exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>But the Committee found a Cure for both the&s;e Evils to|gether, 1. They re&s;olved to make good the Deficiency of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Money, <HI>that is,</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Silver Money, not the Guineas, and &s;o all the Objections of that &s;ort fell to the Ground; And to prevent the Po&s;&s;ibility of bringing in any Quantity of Silver Money from <HI>England,</HI> they appointed all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Money in the Nation to be brought in to certain places all in one Day, where the Sums being told, Sealed up, and laid by till no more was left to bring in, the Money was delivered back again the &s;ame day, with a Certification of the &s;ame, which entitled the Proprietor to the Deficiency to be paid out of the Equivalent.</P>
<P>Thus in one day all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Money in the Kingdom, (<HI>viz.</HI> all the Silver Money) was reduc'd to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Value, and went after that as in <HI>England,</HI> and for no more&mdash;; And as the Rate of Exchanges always attends the Intrin&s;ick Value of the <HI>Specie,</HI> &s;o the Exchanges, which before ran at Eleven or Twelve <HI>per Cent.</HI> to the Di&s;advantage of <HI>Scotland,</HI> immediately came to <HI>A PAR,</HI> and Money ran between <HI>Lon|don</HI> and <HI>Edinburgh</HI> at a half <HI>per Cent.</HI> or at mo&s;t one <HI>per Cent.</HI> &s;ometimes this way, &s;ometimes that way, as the Demand of Remitters and Drawers happened to alter the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>However the Proclamation mentioned in this Vote was con|cealed, till the Time that all Things were ready for this Cal|ling in the Money, that People might not have Notice of the Thing, and con&s;cquently have Room to bring in Money from <HI>England;</HI> It was alledged neverthele&s;s, That &s;everal con&s;ide|rable
<PB N="163" REF="450">
Sums were brought over the Borders, but I never could under&s;tand, That it was proved; for the particulars, the Reader is referred to the Proclamation which contains the Report of the Committee, and &s;hall come in its place.</P>
<P>The Seventeenth Article required no Debate at all, being what every Body acknowledged to be needful.</P>
<P>The Eighteenth Article was &s;o well worded, and every Thing that related to <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;o well provided for, that there was very little Room for Objection, and what was offered merits not to be remembred&mdash;; What was &s;aid re|lating to the Laws, being made Alterable by the Parliament, amounted to nothing but ju&s;t what had been Argued in <HI>Lon|don</HI> at the Treaty; as for tho&s;e that would have it out of the Power of &s;ub&s;equent Parliaments to alter any of the Laws, when they came to con&s;ider, that this was to Bar <HI>Scotland</HI> from having the advantage of a Legi&s;lature, and from what is E&s;&s;ential to all Government, <HI>viz.</HI> To have a Power in Beeing to make &s;uch Laws as they &s;hall want, they pre&s;ently Quitted a Notion &s;o wild, remembring that Laws which are for the publick Good in one Age, may be directly otherwi&s;e in another; And to leave the Parliament no Power to Amend or Alter the Laws, would be to put <HI>Scotland</HI> in a wor&s;e Con|dition than any Nation in the World, that when any part of Her Law became Grievous to Her, it could not, tho' at Her own Reque&s;t, receive any Amendment; the Rea&s;onablene&s;s therefore of its being always in the Power of &s;ub&s;equent Par|liaments to Make or Amend Laws being granted, the Di&s;tinction of the Article admitted the le&s;s Debate, all things being to be done only to the <HI>evident &V;tility of</HI> Scotland.</P>
<P>There was a &s;econd Attempt made here, with relation to Exempting the <HI>Scots</HI> from the Sacramental Te&s;t in <HI>England,</HI> but as it was ju&s;t the &s;ame thing as is mentioned already in the Ob&s;ervation of <HI>November</HI> 12<HI>th.</HI> I need make no further Remark upon it, than this, That it was thrown by as a Thing in its &s;elf Impracticable, Unrea&s;onable for the <HI>Scots</HI> Parlia|ment to meddle with, and as offered only to Embarra&s;s the pre&s;ent great Affair upon the Stage.</P>
<P>The Se&s;&s;ion or Term for Law-proceedings was now further to be Adjourned, and this was thought Nece&s;&s;ary, not only becau&s;e of the pre&s;ent Hurry the Nation was in, being Uni|ver&s;ally taken up about the great Affair of the Union; but it was thought &s;ome Advantages were de&s;igned again&s;t the Treaty, from the Confluence of People that from all Parts of the Kingdom, generally come together on this Occa&s;ion; and the Gentlemen who were for the Union, did not think it Safe to give &s;uch an Opportunity or Pretence, for the Coun|trey to gather to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> as that mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity offer to them.</P>

It was the Subject of no &s;mall Debate here, Whether any Writer &s;hould be capable of being Lord of the Se&s;&s;ion, or Advocats or Coun&s;ellors only; It had been alledged, that it was Di&s;honourable to the Bench of Judges, to rai&s;e any of the Writers, which are a lower Rank of Practitioners, to the Dignity of a Lord of the Se&s;&s;ion; That it was Advancing them over the Heads of the Advocats, that in <HI>England</HI> no Man arrives to the Dignity of a Judge, till he is fir&s;t received within the Bar, <HI>That is,</HI> made a Serjeant; and that till now, Writers were not Admitted.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Motion was even again&s;t Advocates or Clerks of the Se&s;&s;ion too, <HI>till they had &s;erved a certain Number of Years as Advocats;</HI> but the Writers finding them&s;elves ex|cluded by that Vote, got it added after a long Debate.</P>
<P>It remained then to Determine, what Writers &s;hould be Qualified, and which Excluded; but as this Debate &s;eem|ed &s;omething of a Surprize to the Parliament, and the whole Faculty &s;eemed concerned in it, it was put off to the next day&mdash;; The Debate &s;eemed of no great Concern to the Publick, but as it affected private Per&s;ons, who&s;e Intere&s;t was at that time &s;trong in the Parliament, it occa&s;ioned warm Debates.</P>

<P>Then the Parliament re&s;umed the Con&s;ideration of the Debate anent the Qualification of Writers to the Signet, before they can be named ordinary Lords of Se&s;&s;ion: And after &s;ome further Debate as to the time they are to &s;erve as Writers, before they can be ca|pable to be named Lords, there were two States of a Vote offered; the fir&s;t in the&s;e Terms, <HI>Whether they &s;hall &s;erve Twenty Years,</HI> or <HI>none,</HI> and the &s;econd in the&s;e Terms, <HI>Whether they are to &s;erve Eight or Ten Years;</HI> And after &s;ome Rea&s;oning, which of the two &s;hould be the State of the Vote, <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> or <HI>Second,</HI></P>

<P>There needs little to be &s;aid of this Days Work, our la&s;t Ob&s;ervation having &s;tated the Ca&s;e, and the Vote it &s;elf be|ing more particular than ordinary in that Matter.</P>
<P>The Writers to the Signet were admitted to be made or|dinary Lords of the Se&s;&s;ion, upon Conditions and Qualifica|tions as by the Minute, <HI>viz.</HI> Ten Years Continuance as Writer, and Two Years afterward pa&s;&s;ing a Tryal before the Advocats.</P>
<P>But it may not be Unnece&s;&s;ary to Note, That all this De|bate had &s;ome Ground for it that did not yet appear, and &s;ome per&s;onal Views were in it on either Hand; The latter, it can be of no u&s;e to meddle with here, but the Rea&s;ons in general of this Debate were, to foreclo&s;e the admitting Per|&s;ons

<P>Fir&s;t, to Note how the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> on all Oc|ca&s;ions, Encouraged Learning and Indu&s;try, and particularly the Labours and Study of Mr. <HI>James Ander&s;on,</HI> a Gentleman bred to the Study of the Laws of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but by his own In|clination led into that Painful, but mo&s;t Excellent and u&s;e|full

Study of Antiquity&mdash;; In the pro&s;ecution of which, he had begun a mo&s;t Tedious and Chargeable Work in Search after the Antiquities of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had formarly laid before them the Specimens he had made of that Work, which met with a General Approbation, and the Reward allotted him for it, &s;hews the &s;en&s;e the Hou&s;e had of the Greatne&s;s of the Undertaking, which if that Gentleman live to Fini&s;h, it may let the world know, their Money was not ill be&s;towed.</P>
<P>The Naturalizing Mon&s;ieur <HI>Huguetan</HI> was a Thing lay open to &s;ome Reflections, and at fir&s;t look'd meanly enough; The Man was fled from <HI>France,</HI> and as was &s;aid, had De|frauded the King of <HI>France,</HI> and private Per&s;ons al&s;o, of great Sums of Money, and finding him&s;elf un&s;afe in <HI>England,</HI> where a Commi&s;&s;ion of Bankrupt had been attempted to be Sued out&mdash;, he &s;ought Protection here.</P>
<P>However the Parliament con&s;ented to the Naturalization&mdash;, but Limited and Re&s;tricted the Protection he &s;ought with &s;uch ju&s;t and rea&s;onable Clau&s;es, as that Mon&s;ieur <HI>Hugue|tan</HI> never thought fit to take the Benefit of it, but went away to <HI>Holland,</HI> where, what became of him, how he was near being Trapann'd away into <HI>France,</HI> where his Fate had been mo&s;t certain; How the States General re&s;ented the Attempt, and puni&s;hed the Per&s;ons, tho', at the &s;ame time, they did it in Re&s;pect to their own Juri&s;dictions and Con|&s;titution, rather than in re&s;pect to the Per&s;on&mdash;; How afterward he was Marryed to Madamoi&s;ell <HI>D'Odyke,</HI> in &s;pite of all the Oppo&s;ition made by Mon&s;ieur <HI>D'Auverkirke</HI> her near Relation, and Velt Mare&s;chal of the Forces of the States; The&s;e things, as not material to this Hi&s;tory, I &s;hall take no notice of, and only mention the other, to let the World &s;ee, That, tho' the Enemies of <HI>Scotland</HI> loudly clamoured, that, for the &s;ake of bringing Money thither, they would make them&s;elves the Sanctuary of the mo&s;t Infamous Per&s;ons; yet, that upon the Application of this Man, they clogg'd the Fa|vour they be&s;towed with &s;uch ju&s;t Clau&s;es in Relief of the Claims of private Per&s;ons, that, if the Per&s;on &s;ought any Sanctuary again&s;t his ju&s;t Debts, he found it was not to be had in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and therefore he was &s;o far intirely di&s;|appointed.

<P>The Office of the Lord high Admiral for all <HI>Britain,</HI> it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to reduce to one&mdash;; But the Courts of Admiralty having their &s;everal Juri&s;dictions &amp; Authorities were as nece&s;&s;ary as &s;everal private Rights, which by the next Article were to be re&s;erved, depending intirely upon it.</P>
<P>The heretable Rights of Admiralty, &amp; the Vice Admiralties, were al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;upported; and all the&s;e Things made it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve a Court of Admiralty, the Tryals being to be had in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and which by the Con&s;titution and Laws of <HI>Scotland,</HI> re&s;erved as before, could not be legally Transferred to, or taken Cognizance of by the Court of Admiralty of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The like in the Affair of the Exchequer, where, if the Seizures of the Cu&s;toms, if private Rights and Debates between the Queen and Subject, could not have been Tryed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the General Re&s;erve of the Laws to <HI>Scotland;</HI> could not have been maintained, and the Subject would have been put to in|tolerable Inconveniencies and Expences in Pur&s;uing and De|fending in all Pleas of the Crown, or Ca&s;es between the Queen and Her Subjects.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things therefore admitted of very little Debate, but were regulated by the Methods required by the Cu&s;toms and Forms of Law, and then pa&s;t as it were in cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The Affair of the Privy Council was al&s;o left to its own Fate, the Story of which I omit here, becau&s;e it will come nece&s;&s;arly to be &s;poken of in the &s;ub&s;equent part of this
<PB N="174" REF="461">
Hi&s;tory, when it was Depo&s;ed with &s;ome Struggle, and as &s;ome thought, a little &s;ooner than was needful.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Article, which I take to be a very Exten&s;ive one, had pa&s;&s;ed, and been in all its parts Unexceptionable, had not one unhappy Word been brought in, and this was the word <HI>S&V;PERIORITIES;</HI> But this being added without any Condition or Power left in Parliament to Di&s;&s;olve tho&s;e Superiorities, upon an Equivalent to the Owners, whenever the United Parliament &s;hould find Occa&s;ion for the publick Good to do &s;o; has bound down <HI>Scotland</HI> to the private Tyrrany and Oppre&s;&s;ion of the Heretors and Lairds, which it is ea&s;ie to make appear, is at this Time one of the greate&s;t Ob&s;tructions to Her Peace and Pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>The Superiorities meant here, are the Rights of Va&s;&s;alage which the Gentry of <HI>Scotland</HI> have over the People, which, as it is Extended, gives the Chiefs and Heads of Clans, Lairds and Heretors, &s;uch an ab&s;olute Dominion over both the Per|&s;ons and Goods of the poor &s;ubjected People, as &s;eems per|fectly incon&s;i&s;tent both with the Peace and the Improvement of <HI>Scotland</HI> in particular, or of any Free Nation in General, and this two ways.</P>
<P N="1">1. As it gives too great a Power to particular per&s;ons, who are thereby rendred Independent of the Law, and put in too ea&s;ie a Condition to In&s;ult the Government, and break the publick Peace; In&s;tances of which have been given &s;ince the Union, as &s;hall particularly appear in the Proce&s;s of this Hi&s;tory, where Per&s;ons by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of their Tenantry, and the Dominion of their own Superiorities, protected them|&s;elves from the publick Ju&s;tice, and bid Defiance to the ju&s;t Re&s;entments and Su&s;picions of the Government, even in a Time of <HI>French</HI> Inva&s;ion&mdash;. That a Power to put any one in &s;uch a po&s;ture, is incon&s;i&s;tent with the publick peace; I need not &s;pend Time here to Di&s;pute, and <HI>Scotland</HI> may have, and I doubt will have occa&s;ion to acknowledge.</P>
<P N="2">2. As it keeps the Common People and Tenantry of <HI>Scot|land</HI> in a Condition incon&s;i&s;tent with the Liberty of a Free Nation, and under an intolerable Slavery to their Landlords, by which they are effectually prevented either Improving their Stocks for them&s;elves, or their Lands for their Landlords;&mdash;, which the Landlord him&s;elf effectually prevents, by his ab&s;olutely Ruining and Devouring their Indu&s;try at his own will.</P>
<P>This Subject is too long for the Extent of a &s;ingle Ob&s;er|vation, and will be more particularly &s;poken to in its place; but I note it here as the proper Subject of the place, this be|ing the Day when it was introduc'd into the Treaty, and had only this Unhappine&s;s, that it came in, as it were, by Head and Shoulders, without any previous Conditionary Clau&s;e&mdash;; I do not alledge, That the Superiorities of the Gen|try
<PB N="175" REF="462">
&s;hould have been taken away by Law, without Satisfacti|on made to the private E&s;tates of tho&s;e, from whom they &s;hould have been taken, farther is it yet from me to &s;ay, or think, they &s;hould be &s;urrendered to the Crown&mdash;; But certainly had it been left to a Parliament of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to have Di&s;&s;olved them upon any ju&s;t Occa&s;ion, and, by Land or Money, have made a full Recompence to the Pro|prietors, and &s;o have broken that Bond of Slavery by which <HI>Scotland</HI> has been &s;o long &s;uppre&s;s'd, and the Poor kept Poor, their Indu&s;try di&s;couraged, and their Labour devoured; From that Day the Nation had dated its Liberty and Pro&s;|perity; Plenty, and Encouragement to Trade and Manu|factures mu&s;t have followed, &s;ince no People can be &s;uppo&s;ed to Work cheerfully, when they cannot enjoy what they gain, or call it their own.</P>
<P>But this was a Time of Hurry, and People could not look about them as at other Times; Nor was the Liberty of the poor People &s;o near in View, as to move that Concern in Mens minds, which perhaps were it now to be done, might be otherwi&s;e; Whether this or the Fate of <HI>Scotland,</HI> I &s;hall not Determine as the Cau&s;e of the Omi&s;&s;ion&mdash;. But 'tis evi|dent, The Thing is <HI>&V;nhappily for Scotland,</HI> Omitted; And the great Opportunity of extending the Love of Liberty, as well as the Ta&s;te of it, to all the People Irrecoverably Lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The Rights of the Burghs came next to be Debated, the whole Rights of the Burrows were re&s;erved to them by the Union; Nor was any Thing offered now to Abridge tho&s;e Rights, yet it was thought, it both might be the Advantage of the Burrows, and of the Nation in General, to have tho&s;e Rights &s;ubjected to Parliamentary Regulations, but &s;ome People took an Alarm at this, as if the Parliament in time coming, would take away the Privileges of the Royal Bur|rows; and thus in this particular Time of Jealou&s;ie, the great Advantages which both the Burghs of <HI>Scotland</HI> in particular, and the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> in General, might have had from Parliamentary Regulations, were lo&s;t and Foreclo&s;ed, and the Door Barr'd again&s;t any future Alterations to be made by Parliament, were they never &s;o much to the Advan|tage and Benefit of the re&s;pective Parts.</P>
<P>The next Thing brought upon the Stage, was the Num|ber and Manner of Electing the Repre&s;entative, it had been moved in the Debates of the Third Article, but was pur|po&s;ely Adjourned to this, as the proper Time of entring upon it&mdash;. It was too long an Affair to begin at the end of the Day; &s;o it was Adjourned to the next <HI>Sederunt,</HI> when it took up Time enough.</P>

<P>And a Sixth Prote&s;t was given in by the Earl <HI>Mari&s;chal</HI> in the&s;e Terms, <HI>I</HI> William <HI>Earl</HI> Mari&s;chal, <HI>do hereby Prote&s;t, That whatever is contained in any Article of the Treaty of &V;nion betwixt</HI> Scotland <HI>and</HI> England, <HI>&s;hall no manner of way derogate from, or be prejudicial to me, or my Succe&s;&s;ors, in our Heretable Office of Great Mari&s;chal of</HI> Scotland <HI>in all time coming, or in the full and free Enjoyment and Exerci&s;e of the baill Rights, Dignities, Titles, Honours, Powers and Privileges thereto belonging, which my Ance&s;tors and I have Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and Exerci&s;ed as Rights of Property the&s;e Seven Hundred Years.

<HEAD>OBSERVATION LIII.</HEAD>
<P>The Affair of the Number of the Repre&s;entative, whether of the Nobility or Commons, was the Contents of the fir&s;t Pa|ragraph now debated; How, and with what Difficulty, this part of the Equality was &s;ettled in <HI>England,</HI> has been noted al|ready, and the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of the Proportion duly &s;tated there.</P>
<P>It was indeed urged again here, and &s;everal ways di&s;put|ed, but the Di&s;putes here &s;eemed to look another way; And fir&s;t it was vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed, That <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould come to any Repre&s;entative at all; That her whole Parliament &s;hould &s;it in Conjunction with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament, and long Speeches were made on that Head; Some alledging, That it was Di&s;honourable to <HI>Scotland</HI> to le&s;&s;en the Number of her Repre&s;entative, while <HI>England</HI> retained her intire Parlia|ment; Others again attempted to argue again&s;t the very Uniting of the Parliament at all, tho' that was foreclo&s;ed by the fir&s;t Vote pa&s;s'd on the Third Article&mdash;. 3. Others yet went into the Merit of the Cau&s;e, and to Examine the ju&s;t Propor|tion of the Repre&s;entative, and the&s;e objected very vigorou&s;ly, that the Numbers were not equal&mdash;; The Opinions were variou&s;ly divided, as to the Foundation of a true Equality, upon what Principle an Equality of Proportions could be rai&s;ed&mdash;; Some &s;tating the Numbers of People to be the Te&s;t of the Repre|&s;entative; others the Proportion of Taxes, &s;ome an E&s;timate from both; others alledged, there could be no ju&s;t Rule laid down, how an equal Proportion of Repre&s;entatives could be made, to ballance a Kingdom that is not <HI>IT SELF</HI> equally repre&s;ented, and that before <HI>England</HI> had required <HI>Scotland</HI> to reduce their Re|pre&s;entative to a ju&s;t Proportion <HI>to her,</HI> &s;he ought to have reduced her own Repre&s;entative to a ju&s;t Proportion to her &s;elf, either in Number of People, or Payment of Taxes, neither of which, <HI>as they alledged,</HI> were at all regarded in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Repre&s;enta|tive; That it was the Complaint in <HI>England,</HI> and &s;everal had wrote very warmly upon that Subject, that their Taxes were not equally Levyed, or their People equally Repre&s;ented; and it was unrea&s;onable to talk of proportioning <HI>Scotland</HI> to a Country, who&s;e Repre&s;entative was not in its &s;elf equal.</P>
<P>There were &s;everal An&s;wers given to this, the pre&s;ent Cir|cum&s;tances of both Nations in general &s;eemed to be the tru|e&s;t Foundation of a Proportion, wherein, tho' the particular Towns in <HI>England</HI> might not be ju&s;tly proportioned, yet the general might be equal, and thus, without enquiring, whe|ther
<PB N="179" REF="466">
the parts of the Repre&s;entative were equally cho&s;en in <HI>England,</HI> it might be a ju&s;t Proportion, in having the whole brought to a State; And if the Number for <HI>Scotland</HI> bare the &s;ame Proportion to the Number for <HI>England,</HI> as the Num|bers of People, and Wealth or Payment of Taxes, joyntly con&s;idered, of the one part bare to the &s;ame Articles in the other, the Equality was then pre&s;erved&mdash;.</P>
<P>It was remembred, That this had been fully debated in <HI>England,</HI> and that the Number was brought up to the high|e&s;t Proportion that <HI>England</HI> could po&s;&s;ibly grant&mdash;; Mr. <HI>Seton,</HI> in his Speech printed in the Minutes herewith, <HI>Folio</HI> 79<HI>th,</HI> declared, it was above what <HI>Scotland</HI> ought to ex|pect, and that it was a full Proportion. Upon the whole, this fir&s;t Clau&s;e was put to the Vote, and pa&s;&s;ed by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>The Scruples on the &s;econd Paragraph, as principally re|lating to the Manner of I&s;&s;uing out the Writs for Electing the Members, when they &s;hould be Cho&s;en for the Parliament of <HI>Britain,</HI> I take no notice of here, referring that to the Time, when a &s;eparate Act came to be debated in the Hou&s;e for the &s;aid Election.

Mr. <HI>John Lyon,</HI> Mr. <HI>John Carruthers, George Home</HI> and Mr. <HI>Robert Frazer</HI> adhered thereto.</P>
<P>And after &s;ome further Debate, it was agreed, that none of the above Prote&s;ts be in&s;ert at length in the Minutes, or printed, but that they be all Recorded and in&s;ert in the Records of Parlia|ment.</P>
<P>Then the third Paragraph of the twenty &s;econd Article of Union, beginning thus; <HI>And if Her Maje&s;ty on or before the fir&s;t day of</HI> May <HI>next,</HI> &amp;c. and ending with the&s;e Words: <HI>And that Parliaments may continue for &s;uch time only as the pre&s;ent Parliament of</HI> England <HI>might have continued if the &V;nion of the two Kingdoms had not been made, unle&s;s &s;ooner di&s;&s;olved by Her Maje&s;ty,</HI> was read.</P>
<P>And after rea&s;oning thereon, it was moved to add the following Clau&s;e thereto, viz. <HI>And that the &s;aid Parliament of</HI> Great Britain <HI>&s;hall meet and &s;it once in three years, at lea&s;t, in that part of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>now called</HI> Scotland.</P>

<P>The Debate about the Prote&s;tations of the Four Gentle|men above-mentioned, ended now, after &s;ome Heat, in Or|dering the Prote&s;tations to be Recorded and Enrolled in the Regi&s;ters of Parliament, which &s;atisfied all Parties.</P>
<P>It was very much enquired after, Why the&s;e Prote&s;tations &s;hould not be made publick, &s;ince the Gentlemen that made them, did not concern them&s;elves to Conceal them; Some alledged, The Parliament behoved to enter into a Confutati|on of the Matter of the Prote&s;ts, if they made them publick, and either to Approve or Cen&s;ure them: Others thought, The publi&s;hing them might do Harm among the people; and that &s;ince the Parliament were now ju&s;t at the End of the Work, it was better to keep them all Ea&s;ie, than &s;tart any new Di&s;pute. So the Prote&s;ts were not publi&s;hed, but En|tered in the Rolls or Regi&s;ters Office of the Kingdom of <HI>Scot|land</HI>&mdash;, from whence the true Copies of them are taken, and added in the <HI>Appendix</HI> to this Work N^o^. <HI>L. M. N. O.</HI></P>
<P>Then they went upon the Debate of Triennial Parlia|ments, included in the Third Paragraph of the Twenty Se|cond Article&mdash;, and &s;ome were very Urgent for a new Clau&s;e, as in the Minute&mdash;; But when the Gentlemen were put in mind, That by the very Words of the Paragraph, it was expre&s;ly provided, That the Fir&s;t Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> could &s;it no longer than the next en&s;uing Se&s;&s;ion, being the Termination of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament then in Beeing, and that by the Act then in Force in <HI>England,</HI> called <HI>The Triennial Act,</HI> every Parliament was to Terminate in Three Years; The Thing appeared already &s;ettled, and &s;o admitted no further Debate, that Law being among others, continued by the Twenty Fifth Article; Of which in its or|der.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="470">
It was very &s;trange, that notwith&s;tanding the Debates of this Day, and the expre&s;s Provi&s;ion of the Treaty many People flattered them&s;elves with the Notion of the Parliaments con|tinuing to &s;it, nor could it be beaten out of their Thoughts in <HI>England</HI> as well as in <HI>Scotland,</HI> till they &s;aw the very Prepa|rations making for a new Election.</P>
<P>The Propo&s;al for Explaining the &s;everal Oaths to be taken by the Members of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, was Oppo&s;ed, not that there could be any concealed Oath, that was not known to the Members&mdash;; And the particular Oaths of Allegiance, the Declaration, and Abjuration were laid before the Hou&s;e&mdash;, but the Gentlemen who thought fit to Op|po&s;e it, did it on this Foot, That they thought the Articles &s;o expre&s;ly directed to the particular Acts in which the &s;aid Oaths were contain'd, and in which no other Oaths were ex|pre&s;&s;ed, that the Acts being named at large, and referred to, And the Cu&s;tom and U&s;age of Parliament known, and pub|lick, there could be no po&s;&s;ible Fraud, Mi&s;take, or Mi&s;con|&s;truction, but that it was this way as expre&s;ly and directly pointed out, as if it had been Repeated in the Articles, Word for Word.</P>
<P>The Exception about the <HI>Limitation,</HI> mentioned in the 13. <HI>William</HI> III. <HI>Cap.</HI> 6. referring to the Qualification of the Succe&s;&s;ors to the Crown, al&s;o will come to be &s;poken to again in its place.</P>

<P>This whole Day was taken up in debating the Subject of the Word <HI>Limitation,</HI> mentioned in that Famous Act of 13<HI>th W.</HI> 3. in <HI>England</HI>&mdash;; Some had alledged, That, by that Act, if any Per&s;on took upon him the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> un|qualified by any of the Articles therein-named, the Allegiance
<PB N="185" REF="472">
Sworn was not due, and that the Subject would be thereby obliged, by his Oath, to oppo&s;e &s;uch Succe&s;&s;or; Others had declared the Limitations to mean nothing but an Entail of the Succe&s;&s;ion by Parliament, without any Conditions of Go|vernment; and upon the&s;e &s;eeming Uncertainties, the Per|&s;ons that moved this Clau&s;e demanded an Explanation; but it was, upon the whole, not thought proper to undertake any Explanation of an Act, which, as it &s;tood, &s;eemed &s;uffi|cient to &s;ettle the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, and could not hurt the pre&s;ent Scheme, &s;ince, &s;o far as it might oppo&s;e any Branch of the Union, it was provided again&s;t in the Twenty Fifth Article; And to put any Con&s;truction upon it, which might be incon&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Affairs, would be but to lay a Stumbling Block in the way of the Union, and there|fore this Project was al&s;o rejected.</P>
<P>The Affair of the Sacramental Te&s;t had been mentioned before, but never &s;o plainly moved in Parliament as now; It had been moved in the Commi&s;&s;ion of the A&s;&s;embly, and great Endeavours had been u&s;ed, to bring the Mini&s;ters in, as Ob|jectors, and a <HI>Formula</HI> like this had been propo&s;ed there, as is noted already, but it failed on their &s;ide; The Mini&s;ters were, in the fir&s;t place, not willing to meddle with Things of that Nature; And, &s;econdly, As to the <HI>Formula,</HI> many of the Mini&s;ters gave their Opinion, That they did not ap|prove of Impo&s;ing any Oath, or Acknowledgment of the Church, as a Te&s;t of Civil Imployment; And, to have an Oath of Acknowledgment to the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> be a Counter Te&s;t, was a Tacit Approbation of the Method practi|&s;ed in <HI>England,</HI> which they dete&s;ted.</P>
<P>Others again were of the Opinion, That the Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> were already, by the Union, Exempted from the Sacramental Te&s;t in <HI>England</HI> by two &s;everal Clau&s;es&mdash;; 1. In that the Subjects of both Kingdoms were, by the Fourth Article of the Union, to enjoy equal Privileges and Encou|ragements&mdash;; And, 2. That, by the Adam for the Security of the Church Government, no Oath was to be Impo&s;ed upon the Members of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> con|trary to their Principles&mdash;; In arguing the fir&s;t of the&s;e, it was alledged, That, <HI>if a Subject of</HI> Scotland <HI>taking the Sa|crament in the National E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church of</HI> Scotland, <HI>&s;hall not be capable of any Place of Preferment under the Government of</HI> Bri|tain, <HI>as well as a Subject of</HI> England <HI>taking the Sacrament in the National E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church of</HI> England; Then, do not the Sub|jects of either Kingdom enjoy <HI>Equal Privileges</HI>&mdash;; And la&s;t|ly it was argued, That, by the la&s;t Article of the Treaty, the Sacramental Te&s;t might be under&s;tood to be actually Repeal|ed, as Contraveening the Equalities of the Treaty.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Debates it was thought, That, to meddle with this Matter, might do much more Harm than Good; And
<PB N="186" REF="473">
therefore, it was fir&s;t let fall without Doors, and now reject|ed within, and the Article pa&s;s'd without it.</P>

<P>As al&s;o another Overture was given in for adding a Clau&s;e there|to in the&s;e Terms, <HI>That all the Peers of that part of</HI> Great Britain, <HI>now called</HI> Scotland, <HI>Qualified according to Law, &s;hall, after the &V;ni|on, have Right to Sit</HI> Covered <HI>in the Hou&s;e of Peers of</HI> Great Britain, <HI>notwith&s;tanding that the Right to give Vote therein belongs only to the &s;aid Sixteen Peers, who are to be Summoned in the manner appoint|ed by the preceeding Article.</HI></P>

<P>The Debates of this Day related wholly to the Privileges of the Peers, and particularly to the differing Privileges
<PB N="187" REF="474">
of tho&s;e who were to &s;it in the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> from tho&s;e who were not, <HI>i. e.</HI> for the time they were to &s;it; Some would have had it, That tho&s;e that did not &s;it, &s;hould have no manner of Privilege, any more than as a Common|er, till &s;uch time as they &s;hould come to &s;it by Election in the Hou&s;e of Lords, and then tho&s;e that were formerly &s;itting Peers, or Parliament Lords, became dive&s;ted of all their Pri|vileges, unle&s;s they were of the New Election&mdash;; Some thought, the Gentlemen, who were of this Opinion, moved it chiefly, to bring the Peers into a Di&s;ta&s;te of the Union, (all other Hopes being now almo&s;t over, as to the Union on the Side of <HI>Scotland</HI>)&mdash;; And that the Nobility being thereby, as it were, degraded of their Characters, would think it too great a Hard&s;hip, and &s;o fly off from the Treaty in general, or fly to &s;ome Extreme on the other Hand, make+ing &s;ome Demand which the Peers of <HI>England</HI> would not &s;ubmit to.</P>
<P>Others, it was thought, had this further View in the Pro|po&s;al, for Levelling the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility that were not &s;itting Peers with the Commons, That they de&s;igned to propo&s;e the un&s;itting Lords to be capable of being Elected into the Hou&s;e of Commons, and &s;itting in the Lower Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This was received with &s;ome Re&s;entment, as a great Di&s;honour to the Peerage of <HI>Scotland,</HI> by &s;ome people, and e&s;pecially without Doors; The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were Upbraided with endeavouring to have it &s;o&mdash;, in order to le&s;&s;en the Cha|racter of the Nobility of <HI>Scotland.</HI> But in this they wrong'd their own Judgment, as well as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, &s;ince, had &s;uch a Thing been offered, it had been rejected in <HI>England,</HI> as Unequal and Injurious to the Equality we have been &s;o often &s;peaking of, as the Ground of the whole Treaty&mdash;. Nor could it have been Con&s;ented to in <HI>England,</HI> &s;ince it had been a bringing the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility into too great an Influ|ence of Parliamentary Affairs, when Sixteen being already judged &s;ufficient; there might be now Sixty One <HI>Scots</HI> Lords in every Parliament, <HI>viz.</HI> Sixteen in the Hou&s;e of Lords, and Fourty Five in the Commons; Which, when any Thing re|lating, e&s;pecially to the Nobility, or to the Privileges of one Hou&s;e again&s;t the other, might turn the Ballance to this or that &s;ide, to the manife&s;t Injury of the Con&s;titution, which now con&s;i&s;ts in the Equality of Powers and Privileges, and the due Limits &s;et between each kind, to prevent their In|croachment upon one another.</P>
<P>But the Wi&s;dom and Mode&s;ty of the Nobility of <HI>Scotland,</HI> prevented this&mdash;; and the Article had been &s;o well con|&s;idered at <HI>London,</HI> and was &s;o warily Worded, that there was Room for little or no Exception on behalf of the Peers: For 1. As to Privileges, the Sixteen Peers, or the Peers of Parliament for the Time being, had effectually all the Privi|leges
<PB N="188" REF="475">
of the Peers of <HI>England</HI> in the utmo&s;t Extent, and all the Privileges they ever after could receive, could not be received but in Common with the &s;aid Sixteen; Nor could any Ex|ception be made to it, Whether in the Ca&s;es of Parliamen|tary Privileges, or the per&s;onal Privileges in ca&s;e of Trying of Peers, or being Tryed as Criminals.</P>
<P N="2">2. The remainder of the Nobility enjoyed Privileges, every way equal to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nobility, excepting only, <HI>as it is in the Article,</HI> the Rights of &s;itting in the Hou&s;e of Lords, and the Privileges depending thereupon.</P>
<P>But the great Debates of this Day began upon this Clau&s;e, The Rights and Privileges of the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility who were not Lords of Parliament <HI>for the Time being.</HI></P>
<P>And Fir&s;t it was moved to be excepted, That the &s;aid Lords &s;hould not enjoy the Privilege of per&s;onal Protection in Ca&s;es of Debt, as is the Privilege of the Peers of <HI>England</HI>&mdash;; Some alledged they pleaded for the Honour of the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility in this Head, that it was below their Dignity to be protected by their Titles again&s;t their ju&s;t Obligations, and a Meanne&s;s they had all along Contemned, to plead the Privilege of their Hou&s;e again&s;t the proceedings of the Law; That it was not agreeable to the true Intent and Meaning of Parliamentary Privileges, that this Privilege &s;hould extend to tho&s;e that did not &s;it in Parliament, &s;ince the Privileges of Parliament of this kind, were at fir&s;t appointed to provide again&s;t any Im|pediment to &s;itting in Parliament, that the Members of either Hou&s;es &s;hould on no pretence what ever, be hindred from the Service of their Countrey in Parliament&mdash;; And this could not be of any Signification in tho&s;e Peers that were not &s;itting Members of the Hou&s;e of Lords; That for the <HI>Scots</HI> Peers to claim Protection for their Per&s;ons again&s;t their ju&s;t Debts, was more than levelling their Per&s;ons with the Com|mons, for it was &s;etting them below the Commons, &s;ince no Man would then Tru&s;t the Nobility in Matters of Debt, with|out &s;ome Commoner being Security for them, again&s;t whom they might have remedy at Law.</P>
<P>The&s;e Objections had no little Weight, and this Privi|lege of the Per&s;ons of the Peers in Ca&s;es of Debt, &s;eemed at fir&s;t View, very grievous to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and &s;ome of the Peers them&s;elves looked upon it as Di&s;honourable.</P>
<P>But when it was calmly Con&s;idered and An&s;wered, That the Per&s;ons of the Peers in <HI>England,</HI> are accounted Sacred on &s;everal Accounts, be&s;ides tho&s;e of Debt&mdash;, that even the Government can not proceed again&s;t a Peer, but in an Ex|traordinary way, that no Warrant can be Executed in the Hou&s;e of a Peer, but by Three Ju&s;tices of the Peace&mdash;; And that there are &s;everal nece&s;&s;ary Exemptions to the Peerage which this Privilege pre&s;erves, be&s;ides that of Debt&mdash;; And which, as they are the Hereditary Coun&s;ellors of the
<PB N="189" REF="476">
Nation, and have frequently Great Tru&s;ts committed to, them&mdash;; And both are, and ought to be a great and ready A&s;&s;i&s;tance to the publik Good, upon &s;udden Emergencies, which, upon pretence of Arre&s;ts and Attachments for Debt, may be prevented. That as to the Ju&s;tice of Per&s;onal Pro|tection in ca&s;e of Debt, it was An&s;wered, Their E&s;tates were not protected in &s;everal Ca&s;es, only their Per&s;ons&mdash;; And it was as Rea&s;onable to pur&s;ue the E&s;tate, as the Per&s;on of the Debitor&mdash;, and e&s;pecially in <HI>Scotland,</HI> where the Law reaches the Effects of the Debitor, tho' on per&s;onal Bonds&mdash;. That as to the Credit and Honour of being protected again&s;t ju&s;t Debts, it would be much more for the Honour of the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility, that they gave all Men Notice, That they de&s;pi&s;ed the Advantage of their per&s;onal Credit, and &s;ince they could not Sue a Nobleman, they might Decline Tru&s;ting them, and welcome: And for tho&s;e that were Tru&s;ted, tho' they could not be Sued, it was yet greater Reputation to them, that the principle of Honour in them was &s;o well known, that Men would depend upon their Honour, where they could not otherwi&s;e oblige them to make payment.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e, and the like Con&s;iderations, this Motion was Rejected, and the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility by virtue of that Clau&s;e in the Twenty Third Article, <HI>And &s;hall enjoy all other privileges of Peers, as fully as the Peers of</HI> England <HI>now do, or as they, or any other Peers of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>may hereafter enjoy the &s;ame;</HI> are protected in their Per&s;ons and E&s;tates as the Peers of <HI>England</HI> are&mdash;, whether they (the <HI>Scots</HI> Peers) are Peers of Parliament at that Time, or no.</P>
<P>The next Di&s;pute was, a Privilege demanded for the Peers of <HI>Scotland,</HI> that they, not being of the Parliament at that Time, might &s;it in the Hou&s;e of Lords Cover'd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but not have any Right to Vote&mdash;; This was Urged many ways, either that they might have a Gallery to &s;it in as Spectators, or that they might &s;tand behind the Throne, as the elde&s;t Sons of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Peers may&mdash;; And either of the&s;e, was thought, might have been obtained&mdash;. But the main De&s;ign of bringing them in to be pre&s;ent at Debates, to Argue, Speak and Debate upon the &s;everal Matters that &s;hould be brought before the Hou&s;e, this was Oppo&s;ed upon &s;everal Accounts; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> As it was thought Impracticable, and an Inva&s;ion of the Hou&s;e of Peers as a Hou&s;e, and what could not be obtained, if pu&s;ht at. <HI>Secondly,</HI> As it was thought an In&s;ignificant Thing, to have per&s;ons to &s;it and argue, who had no power to De|termine. And <HI>Thirdly,</HI> As it would be far from any Honour to the Nobility of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to be admitted into Debates, where they mu&s;t always have the Mortification of being di&s;tingui&s;hed, and like meer Solicitors, who&s;e place is with|out the Bar, be allowed to Talk, and yet have no &s;ignification in a Que&s;tion&mdash;; But if the Hou&s;e divided, be obliged to
<PB N="190" REF="477">
&s;tand all together like Mutes in an Alphabet, who have no &s;ound in the Expre&s;&s;ion of a Syllable.</P>
<P>And thus ended the Debates of this great point, the Pri|vilege of the Peerage, and the Article received no manner of Alteration.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION LVIII.</HEAD>
<P>The Debate of the Rank and Precedency of the Heraulds, and of the Quartering of Arms, the Standards and Colours was a Thing of no great Con&s;equence, nor could it be re|ferred to any Body better than to Her Maje&s;ty; and therefore the Di&s;pute of this was not long.</P>
<P>The keeping the Honours, as they called them, in <HI>Scot|land, viz.</HI> The Crown, Scepter and Sword, was indeed a Material Point, at lea&s;t, as it had been made &s;o by &s;ome Gentlemen, who had pretended to excite the Common People with Apprehen&s;ions, That they were to be all carryed away to <HI>England,</HI> as Tokens of Surrendering the Sovereignty of <HI>Scotland</HI> to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>&mdash;; But, as no &s;uch Thing was ever thought of in <HI>England,</HI> the Propo&s;al met with no Op|po&s;ition; And &s;ome people thought, That not only the En&s;igns of Royalty, but the Royalty it &s;elf, Sovereignty and Govern|ment of <HI>Scotland,</HI> remain as intire, as the &s;ame Things re&s;pect|ing <HI>England</HI> remain intire, either Kingdom voluntarly con|&s;enting to an Union of Power, an Union of Government, and of all Things needful to pre&s;erve both.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Article, re&s;pecting the Abrogation of all Laws, which might be &s;uppo&s;ed to Contraveen the Treaty, met with no Oppo&s;ition at all.</P>
<P><HI>And thus this Weighty Affair was Fini&s;hed on the Side of</HI> Scotland, <HI>contrary, I believe I may &s;ay, to the Expectation of all the World, who were amazed to &s;ee a Thing of that Con&s;equence, and with Difficulties which &s;eemed in them&s;elves in&s;uperable, &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully brought to a Clo&s;e; A Thing which had been &s;o many Times attempted in vain; A Thing which had &s;o often been &s;et about, rather in a Show than De&s;ign of &V;niting; And I think I may &s;ay, a Thing that never was heartily &s;et about on both Sides before.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It had held the Parliament of</HI> Scotland <HI>a Long, a Trouble&s;ome, a Dangerous, and I mu&s;t owne a very &V;ncomfortable Debate, Step by Step, and Article by Article, from the Third of</HI> October <HI>to the Fourteenth of</HI> January, <HI>with very little Intermi&s;&s;ion, for never was Bu&s;ine&s;s clo&s;er applyed, more &s;trenuou&s;ly pu&s;h'd, or more vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Work that remained (I mean to the Parliament) was but &s;hort, and I &s;hall do little more than relate the Fact, which will be found in the Minutes of Parliament&mdash;; And I &s;hall &s;et them down in their Order, omitting what relates to private Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, as not material here&mdash;; Since I can very ill &s;pare Room for any thing, but what relates immediately to the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and agrees with the Title&mdash;</HI></P>

<P>The Articles were now gone through, and fini&s;hed as before&mdash;, yet there remained two Things to be done in or|der to Compleating the Affair, &s;o far as referred to <HI>Scotland;</HI> One was to pa&s;s the Act of Security for the Presbyterian Church Government in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which was to be Ingro&s;&s;ed and In&s;erted in the Body of the Act of Union, &amp; made a part of it&mdash;; And then, to pa&s;s in Parliament &s;ome &s;ub&s;equent Acts, which being previous to the Treaty, or depending upon it, ought to be Fini&s;hed in Parliament before the Union, and would be of Cour&s;e Confirmed by it, by virtue of the Eigh|teenth Article, Continuing and Confirming all Laws and Acts then in Force, except &s;uch only as came within the Reach of
<PB N="193" REF="480">
the Twenty Fifth Article, <HI>viz.</HI> Such as were contrary to, and incon&s;i&s;tent with the Union.</P>
<P>The&s;e were, 1. An Act to Settle and Determine the Con|&s;titution of the Manner of Electing the Repre&s;entatives for <HI>Scotland</HI> in the en&s;uing Parliament of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> 2. An Act for Plantation of Kirks, a Thing long wanted in <HI>Scotland,</HI> together with the Valuation of Teinds or Tithes, and about the Rever&s;ions of Kirk Lands. 3.

<P>The&s;e Things were nece&s;&s;ary Adjuncts to the Treaty&mdash;; But as the Act of Union it &s;elf was the Foundation, on which all the&s;e Things were depending, and that there was a great deal yet to be done to it, <HI>viz.</HI> To be Ingro&s;&s;ed and pa&s;s'd into an Act, and &s;ent to <HI>London;</HI> The Interval of Time, after the main Affair &s;hould be di&s;patched, was thought the proper Sea&s;on to Settle, Pa&s;s and Enact all the&s;e Things; wherefore they re&s;olved to go fir&s;t to Work with the Act, and that no Time might be lo&s;t, the Act had been drawing up, with all the Amendments to every Article, as they had pa&s;s'd in the Hou&s;e, and was ready to pre&s;ent to the Hou&s;e this Day&mdash;; And, as <HI>per</HI> the Minute, obtained a fir&s;t Reading, all other Bu&s;ine&s;s being delayed&mdash;.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Act of Ratification after it was pa&s;t in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> till the Exemplification of it was returned from the Parliament of <HI>England.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The Parliament of <HI>England</HI> being to be the Fini&s;hers of this great Work, and the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> not Meeting till it was late enough in the year, <HI>viz.</HI> the &s;econd of <HI>October;</HI> The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Par|liament were by &s;mall Adjournments, put off, as long as it was po&s;&s;ible the publick Affairs of <HI>England</HI> could permit, and longer than any Parliament &s;ince the <HI>Revolution</HI> had been delayed, not ha|ving Met till the Third of <HI>December</HI>&mdash;, when the publick Bu&s;ine&s;s admitting no more delay, they came together:</P>
<P>It is worth Ob&s;ervation, that this was a &s;trange concurring Juncture, a Critical Moment, as it may be called, in which Provi|dence &s;eemed to bring every Thing together, that could Propagate the Great Affair of the Uniting the Kingdoms; And which it may not be Improper to Notice in this place, becau&s;e at the Opening of this Se&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament, the Queen Her &s;elf took No|tice of it.</P>
<P>The Campaign Abroad had Ended in the mo&s;t Glorious manner for the Confederates, that could be de&s;ired, and above all manner of Expectation, the <HI>French</HI> had received three Blows that very Sum|mer, enough to Overthrow the greate&s;t Empire in the World; One under the Conduct of the Earl of <HI>Peterburgh,</HI> with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Forces and Fleet in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> Relieving the City of <HI>Barce|lona,</HI> and cau&s;ing the <HI>French</HI> with the Lo&s;s of all their Cannon and Ammunition, to rai&s;e the Siege; One under the Command of the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> being the great Victory at <HI>Ramellies</HI> in <HI>Flan|ders;</HI> And the la&s;t under the Command of Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> of <HI>Sa|voy,</HI> at <HI>Turin.</HI> In all which Actions, it was Calculated, that the <HI>French</HI> lo&s;t, Slain in Action, Taken Pri&s;oners, De&s;erted, and Dead of their Wounds, above 100000 Men, with 300 pieces of Cannon and Mortars, and other Spoil without, and indeed pa&s;t all manner of Account.</P>
<P>There are two Rea&s;ons, why I take this Occa&s;ion to mention this here&mdash;, and both are Introductory to the pre&s;ent Affair.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The People of <HI>England</HI> by the&s;e great Succe&s;&s;es, made Glad and Ea&s;ie in Hopes of a &s;peedy Peace, were prepared to Grant almo&s;t any thing which the Queen in Rea&s;on could Ask, and the Queen di&s;covering a pa&s;&s;ionate De&s;ire, to &s;ee Her two Jarring, long Contending Kingdoms United, the Parliament came together with a Temper di&s;po&s;ed to yield (as far as Rea&s;on could &s;ugge&s;t) more, than perhaps at any other Juncture could have been expected.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="198" REF="485">
2. The Enemies of the Union, whether Abroad or at Home, received mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Di&s;couragement in their De&s;igns again&s;t it&mdash;, and fir&s;t Abroad.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>There could be but two kinds of Enemies Abroad, to the Union, and the&s;e were the <HI>French,</HI> or the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> they were now in &s;o clo&s;s a Confederacy with <HI>England,</HI> and their whole Concern as to the War, was &s;o involved together, that there was no Room for any publick Differences about it. Nor indeed could the <HI>Dutch</HI> have put in any rational Objection again&s;t it, to either Side, if the Intere&s;t of <HI>Holland</HI> Cla&s;ht with the Union upon any &s;ort, it was only with re&s;pect to Trade; and tho' they might perhaps on that Score, have &s;ome Rea&s;on to be Jealous of it, as what might <HI>&s;ome Time or other</HI> Cla&s;h with them in the Fi&s;hing and Ea&s;tern Trades, yet they could have no pretence to concern them&s;elves publickly and Nationally again&s;t it. And as for private Negotiations to Embarra&s;s or prevent it, tho' as <HI>I have been Informed,</HI> they were once or twice con&s;idering of it, yet they never thought fit to meddle, whether it was that they &s;aw no pro&s;pect of &s;ucceeding in it, or that they were not willing to do any thing at that Time, that &s;hould give an Unea&s;ine&s;s to <HI>Eng|land,</HI> or not, I &s;hall not pretend to Determine.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>French,</HI> the&s;e had no doubt Stomach enough to it, and had Tools enough to work with; And I mu&s;t own, had they but made the lea&s;t Attempt, they had effectually broke up the Treaty for that Time; But GOD had tyed their Hands, and Cut them out other Work, they were be&s;et and Embarra&s;t on every Hand, and had no Lea&s;ure to look this way; Nor, if they had had Lea&s;ure, had they Men or Money then to &s;pare, being Imployed with all their Power and Diligence, to Recruit their Troops, and Re&s;tore their own Affairs.</P>
<P>And I cannot but Record this, as a &s;ingular Hand of Heaven, in the Affair of the Union; For tho', when the next year the <HI>French</HI> did make an Attempt upon <HI>Scotland,</HI> when their Affairs being bet|tered after their Succe&s;s in <HI>Spain,</HI> they thought them&s;elves in a Condition for it&mdash;, they found it too late; And that the Op|po&s;ers of the Union were &s;ettled, and would not appear for them&mdash;, yet I mu&s;t &s;ay, had they made that Attempt at the Time of this Treaty, whatever they might have done in the End, to|wards Opening the Eyes of the People, and Re&s;toring them to their Sen&s;es, they had certainly put all the Nation into the utmo&s;t Con|fu&s;ion for the Time, and effectually have broken up the Treaty.</P>
<P>The Parliament of <HI>England</HI> was now Met <HI>December</HI> 3. 1707, &amp; the Queen Opened the Se&s;&s;ion with the following Speech, which I In&s;ert here, as it refers to the Treaty of Union, and al&s;o as it Hints at the Succe&s;&s;es I mentioned above.</P>

<SALUTE>My Lords and Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Hope We are all Met together at this Time, with Hearts truly Thankful to Almighty GOD for the Glorious Succe&s;&s;es, with which He has Ble&s;&s;ed Our Arms and tho&s;e of Our Allies through the whole Cour&s;e of this Year, and with Serious and Steady Re|&s;olutions to Pro&s;ecute the Advantages We have Gain'd, till We Reap the De&s;ired Fruit of them, in an Honourable and Durable Peace.</P>
<P>The Goodne&s;s of GOD has brought this Happy Pro&s;pect &s;o much nearer to Us, that if We be not wanting to Our &s;elves, We may, upon good Grounds, Hope to See &s;uch a Ballance of Power E&s;ta|bli&s;ht in <HI>Europe,</HI> that it &s;hall no longer be at the Plea&s;ure of one Prince to Di&s;turb the Repo&s;e, and Endanger the Liberties of this Part of the World.</P>

<P><HI>Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Commons,</HI></P>
<P>As I am fully Per&s;waded You are all of this Mind, &s;o I mu&s;t Ear|ne&s;tly De&s;ire You to Grant Me Supplies &s;ufficient for Carrying on the War next Year in &s;o Effectual a Manner, that We may be able to Improve every where the Advantages of this Succe&s;sful Campaign: And I A&s;&s;ure You I &s;hall make it my Bu&s;ine&s;s to See All You Give Apply'd to tho&s;e Ends with the greate&s;t Care and Management.</P>
<P><HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>In Pur&s;uance of the Powers Ve&s;ted in Me by Act of Parlia|ment both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> I have appointed Commi&s;&s;io|ners to Treat of an Union between the Two Kingdoms, and tho' this be a Work of &s;uch a Nature, as could not but be at|tended with great Difficulties, yet &s;uch has been the Application of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, that they have Concluded a Treaty, which is at this Time before the Parliament of <HI>Scotland;</HI> And I Hope the Mutual Advantages of an Entire Union of the Two Kingdoms will be found &s;o apparent, that it will not be long before I &s;hall have an Opportunity of Acquainting You with the Succe&s;s which it has Met with there.</P>
<P>Your Meeting at this Time being Later than U&s;ual, I cannot Conclude, without Earne&s;tly Recommending to You to Give as

much Di&s;patch to the Publick Affairs, as the Nature of them will Admit, it being of the Greate&s;t Con&s;equence, that both Our Friends and Our Enemies &s;hou'd be Fully Convinced of Your Firmne&s;s, and the Vigour of Your Proceedings.</P>

<P>I &s;hall not meddle here with any of the Proceedings of the Par|liament of <HI>England</HI> in their own Affairs, they having no relation to the Ca&s;e in Hand; Only make this &s;hort Remark, That, not|with&s;tanding the Latene&s;s of their coming together, <HI>the Occa&s;ion of which was known to be to attend the Debates of the Parliament of</HI> Scot|land, they fell &s;o heartily about their Bu&s;ine&s;s, and went on &s;o &s;moothly in every Thing, that they got the Land Tax Bill pa&s;t ra|ther &s;ooner in it than it u&s;ed to be in any former Parliaments&mdash;; And before <HI>Chri&s;tma&s;s,</HI> had not only the Land Tax, but &s;everal other of their Publick Funds &s;ettled, and in an unu&s;ual Forward|ne&s;s&mdash;, which is a Confirmation of the Extraordinary Di&s;po&s;iti|on, which, as I have noted, appeared in <HI>England</HI> at this time, and of which we &s;hall &s;ee further In&s;tances pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>It was the Sixteenth Day of <HI>January,</HI> that the Ratification of the Union pa&s;s'd in <HI>Scotland;</HI> On the Eighteenth the Duke of <HI>Queensberry</HI> di&s;patch'd it away by an Expre&s;s; There were &s;everal Gentlemen who contended for the Honour of Carrying it up to the Queen, but, to avoid giving any Offence, it was &s;ent by an ordinary Courrier or Expre&s;s.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as it came to the Queen, Her Maje&s;ty cau&s;ed it to be laid before both Hou&s;es, that, tho' it was fir&s;t to pa&s;s one Hou&s;e, and then the other, yet the particular Hou&s;es might be upon the &s;everal Articles together.</P>
<P>Great was the Expectation in both Kingdoms from the&s;e De|bates of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament, and in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Fears on one Hand, and the Hopes on the other, are not to be expre&s;s'd&mdash;, but the Hou&s;e of Commons deceived both Sides.</P>
<P>On the Twenty Second of <HI>January</HI> it was read in the Hou&s;e of Commons&mdash;. and as the be&s;t way to go thro' the whole, they ordered every Article to be Read and Voted upon &s;ingly in the Committee of the whole Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>It may perhaps &s;urprize Po&s;terity, when the <HI>Debates, Di&s;putes, Heats</HI> and long <HI>Speeches,</HI> which the&s;e Articles occa&s;ioned in <HI>Scotland,</HI> come to be read&mdash;, and they &s;hall come to under&s;tand, that, in the Hou&s;e of Commons in <HI>England,</HI> every Article pa&s;s'd one by one after the Sedate&s;t Reading, Calme&s;t Con&s;idering, and Lea&s;urely Pro|ceeding, without any Oppo&s;ition, Amendment or Alteration, no not in the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>There was &s;ome &s;mall Oppo&s;ition again&s;t it in general in the Hou&s;e of Lords&mdash;, but no Amendment offered to any particular Article, nor any thing con&s;iderable objected; what was objected &s;eems generally contained in &s;ome Prote&s;ts, and Rea&s;ons given in by the Per&s;ons Prote&s;ting again&s;t it, which were but few, and not much noticed.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="488">
At the &s;ame time that the Articles were Reading in the Hou&s;e of Commons, an Act was al&s;o prepared by the Bi&s;hops, to whom that Affair was referred for Security of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> to be pa&s;&s;ed in the Parliament, and then Ratified, by being In&s;erted in the Body of the Act of Union, as the Act for the Security of of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> had been done before.</P>
<P>This had been &s;o far provided for by a Blank left in the Treaty of Ratification to which, &s;o far as it concerned the Security of the Church of <HI>England</HI> only, the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> declared them&s;elves to a&s;&s;ent, as if it was expre&s;&s;ed; And this was thought but ju&s;t, the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> having had the Drawing up, and Wording of their own Act of Security them&s;elves, tho' &s;ome People made loud Objections again&s;t this, as a plain E&s;tabli&s;hing Epi&s;copacy in <HI>England</HI> by the very Parliament of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>It was indeed leaving the Thing as Self-exi&s;tent, as it was po&s;|&s;ible, it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, That the Treaty of Union &s;hould be Ratified by either Kingdom&mdash;; But, as to the Acts &s;everally E&s;tabli&s;hing the re&s;pective Churches, they were the di&s;tinct Act and Deed of either Kingdom: And, if the <HI>Scots</HI> may be &s;aid to have Con&s;ented to E&s;tabli&s;h Epi&s;copacy, it is every whit as plain, That the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have E&s;tabli&s;h'd Presbytery in <HI>Scotland,</HI> with this fur|ther Di&s;tinction, That what has been done in <HI>Scotland,</HI> is an Act of the State only, in <HI>England</HI> both Church and State have given their Sanction to the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Presbyterian Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Bi&s;hops being the Repre&s;entatives of the Church of <HI>England</HI> in this Ca&s;e&mdash;; At the &s;ame Time, I think the Matter clear, That, with re&s;pect to Union, their E&s;tabli&s;hment is Recipro|cally &s;ecure, and either Kingdoms cannot now put their Hand to the Weakening or Injuring the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the other, without &s;etting, at the &s;ame time, its Hand to the De&s;truction of its own Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>This Act for the Security of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> &s;eems to be the exact Copy of the Act for Security of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> with the nece&s;&s;ary Alterations only of Names, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> A Te&s;timony indeed unexpected to the Sufficiency of the Act of Security for <HI>Scot|land,</HI> in that the Church of <HI>England</HI> Divines being left to their full Liberty to make their Con&s;titution as &s;afe as it was po&s;&s;ible to be, contented them&s;elves with the very &s;ame Model which the <HI>Scots</HI> had pa&s;s'd for them&s;elves, as the be&s;t and compleate&s;t Security they could devi&s;e&mdash;, which they that cavilled &s;o much at the Securi|ty of the Act in <HI>Scotland</HI> as in&s;ufficient, might have received great Satisfaction from, if they had thought fit&mdash;.</P>
<P>The Copy of this Act in <HI>England</HI> is added in the <HI>Appendix, N^o. H. xx.</HI></P>
<P>I need not Count Days, nor Enter into the Minutes of this Affair in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament; It may &s;uffice to tell the Reader, That the whole Act pa&s;s'd both Hou&s;es by the Fourth of <HI>March,</HI> and the Queen pa&s;s'd it on the Sixth: It was de&s;igned to have delayed the pa&s;&s;ing it to the Eighth, which was the Day of Her Maje&s;ties

coming to the Crown; That &s;o the Day might have been doubly Remembered, for the Commencement of Her Maje&s;ties Reign over the Three Kingdoms fir&s;t, and then over the United Kingdom of <HI>Britain;</HI> But Her Maje&s;ty, not willing to delay a Thing which the whole I&s;land waited &s;o much for, and had their Eyes upon, went to the Hou&s;e of Lords on the Sixth of <HI>March,</HI> and having pa&s;s'd the Bill, made the following Speech, with which I think I may clo&s;e this &s;hort Period of the Union, I mean its pa&s;&s;ing in <HI>Eng|land.</HI><Q>There was &s;ome Oppo&s;ition made to the Articles in the Hou&s;e of Lords in <HI>England,</HI> and &s;ome Lords Prote&s;ted again&s;t the &s;everal Articles, and &s;ome again&s;t all of them&mdash;; But the Hou&s;e of Lords in <HI>England</HI> having expre&s;ly forbid the Printing any of the Proceedings of their Hou&s;e, I cannot enter upon the Hi&s;torical Part of it; I hope &s;omething like an Abridgment of &s;ome Matters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may be found in the <HI>Ap|pendix,</HI> N^o.

<P>It was not very ea&s;ie to know the Rea&s;on, why they de|&s;ired the Petitory part, as they called it, of this Paper to be in&s;erted in the Minutes&mdash;; Some were of the Opinion, it was to &s;how the Nation, That the Oppo&s;ers of the Union were Friends to the Church, and that they would have it ap|pear, they &s;tood up for the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI>&mdash;; Others thought it was with de&s;ign to Expo&s;e the Presbyterians to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as utter Enemies to their Con&s;titution&mdash;; Nor could I ever hear any other Rea&s;ons given for it&mdash;. However, the Duke after having with &s;ome Di|ficulty obtained a Vote upon it, <HI>LOST IT;</HI> And &s;o the Re|pre&s;entation and Petition was left ju&s;t where they found it, <HI>viz.</HI> As a Te&s;timony of the Church again&s;t &s;ome Things which were thought to Cla&s;h, both with their Con&s;titution and a little with their Principles, and in this it was thought it had its U&s;es, tho' it was not effectually An&s;wered in Parlia|ment.</P>
<P>The Affair of the Electing their Members for the fir&s;t Par|liament of <HI>Britain,</HI> came next upon the Stage, and the Ground of the Motion mentioned in the Minutes, was foun|ded upon a Suppo&s;ition mentioned in the Twelfth Article of the Treaty, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>Her Maje&s;ty on or before the fir&s;t day of</HI> May, <HI>on which day the &V;nion was to take place, &s;hould declare under the Great Seal of</HI> England, <HI>that it is Expedient that the Lords of Parliament of</HI> England, <HI>and Commons of the pre&s;ent Parliament of</HI> England, <HI>&s;hould be the Members of the re&s;pective Hou&s;es of the first Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain, <HI>for and on the part of</HI> Great-Britain. Now it was thought very equal, that if the <HI>then pre&s;ent &s;itting</HI> Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> &s;hould be Nam|med
<PB N="205" REF="492">
for the fir&s;t Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> in Conjunction with the &s;everal Members that &s;hould be Named from <HI>Scot|land,</HI> that the Members of both Hou&s;es which were to Re|pre&s;ent <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;hould be likewi&s;e Named out of the current or then pre&s;ent &s;itting Parliament of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>It was pretty ea&s;ie to conjecture, that Her Maje&s;ty would appoint the&s;e Members of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament, to Con&s;ti|tute the fir&s;t <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, as it after happened, and therefore this was Moved now&mdash;, in order to &s;ettle it in the Act of Parliament now to be made, in which it was ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be Determined, this Matter being to be Signed, and pa&s;t into a Law, before the Union was to take place&mdash;. What vigorous Oppo&s;ition it met with, will be &s;een in the next Ob&s;ervation.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION LXII.</HEAD>
<P>The Rea&s;on of the Earl of <HI>Stair</HI>'s taking the Oaths now, and his place in Parliament, was very Unhappy at this Time; his Father the Earl of <HI>Stair,</HI> ju&s;tly reputed the greate&s;t Man of Coun&s;el in the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> died &s;udden|ly the Eighth of this Moneth&mdash;; he had been an Eminent In&s;trument in carrying on the Union, and had, the very day of his Death, &s;poken very Earne&s;tly in the Hou&s;e, upon &s;ome particular Ca&s;es relating to the Union, he went out of the Hou&s;e not very Well, yet went Home, and Wrote &s;everal Letters that very Night to <HI>England,</HI> and in the Morning Died in his Bed, without being able to &s;peak &s;o much as to his Lady, who was with him, to the general Grief of the whole I&s;land, being Univer&s;ally Lamented.</P>
<P>The Debate was now renewed about Choo&s;ing the Repre|&s;entatives for the fir&s;t Parliament, the principal Objection was again&s;t Choo&s;ing them out of the current Parliament&mdash;; As to the Allegations of its being again&s;t Law and Con&s;tituti|on, and again&s;t the Twenty Second Article of the Treaty ju&s;t then ratified, they all Center'd in this, that it was to be pa&s;&s;ed and approved by Parliament; And that Parliament having yet the whole Legi&s;lature in their Hands, had power to Repeal any Law, or Statute then in Beeing, and con&s;e|quently did &s;o far repeal any Clau&s;e in any Act of Parliament formerly made&mdash;; As to its being again&s;t the Treaty now ratified, that was Rectified thus, That whereas the Act of Ratification of the Treaty of Union in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in which &s;everal Acts &s;ince made and to be made in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> were yet to be in&s;erted, lay now before the Parliament of <HI>England</HI>&mdash;; What ever Me|thod the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> thought fit to take, for the Nomination of the Members of Parliament, for the fir&s;t Par|liament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> &s;hould, and mu&s;t of Cour&s;e al&s;o be in&s;erted, and &s;o be and become an E&s;&s;ential Part or Branch of the Union; And this Vote having pa&s;&s;ed as <HI>per</HI> the Minute, is in&s;erted in the &s;aid Act for &s;ettling the Election
<PB N="208" REF="495">
of the Members, and again Recited in the Act of Union, as <HI>per</HI> the Exemplification, appears, in the&s;e Words; <HI>in that Ca&s;e only, Doth hereby</HI> Statute <HI>and</HI> Ordain, <HI>That the Sixteen Peers and Fourty Five Commi&s;&s;ioners for Shires and Burghs, who &s;hall be Cho&s;en by the Peers, Barons and Burghs re&s;|pectively in this pre&s;ent Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, and out of the Members thereof, in the &s;ame manner as Committees of Parlia|ment are u&s;ually now Cho&s;en, &s;hall be the Members of the re&s;|pective Hou&s;es of the &s;aid Fir&s;t Parliament of</HI> Great Britain, <HI>for and on the part of</HI> Scotland; <HI>Which Nomination and Election being Certifyed by a Write under the Lord Clerk Regi&s;ters Hand, The Per&s;ons &s;o Nominated and Elected &s;hall have Right to Sit and Vote in the Hou&s;e of Lords, and in the Hou&s;e of Commons of the &s;aid Fir&s;t Parliament of</HI> Great Britain; <HI>As by the &s;aid Act pa&s;&s;ed in</HI> Scotland, for &s;ettling the Manner of Electing the Sixteen Peers and Fourty Five Members to Repre&s;ent <HI>Scot|land</HI> in the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain</HI> may appear; <HI>Be it therefore further</HI> Enacted <HI>and</HI> Declared <HI>by the Authority afore|&s;aid, That the &s;aid la&s;t mentioned Act pa&s;&s;ed in</HI> Scotland, for &s;ettling the Manner of Electing the Sixteen Peers and Fourty Five Members to Repre&s;ent <HI>Scotland</HI> in the Parliament of <HI>GREAT BRITAIN,</HI> as afore&s;aid, <HI>&s;hall be, and the &s;ame is hereby Declared to be as valid, as if the &s;ame had been part of, and Ingro&s;&s;ed in the &s;aid Articles of &V;nion, Ratified and Ap|proved by the &s;aid Act of Parliament of</HI> Scotland, <HI>and by this Act as afore&s;aid,</HI> and carried it for the New Model; The Two Prote&s;tations again&s;t it made a great Noi&s;e, and were print|ed and carryed all over the Kingdom, be&s;ides their being printed in the Minutes of Parliament. Some &s;aid, the chief Rea&s;on why they in&s;i&s;ted on this &s;o much was, That the Party who oppo&s;ed the Union fore&s;aw, that, as they had been outvoted and overpowered, as they called it, in every Que&s;tion relating to the Union, &s;o they would be in this, and that, by Con&s;equence, few or none of them would be Named to the Fir&s;t <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, which was really true in the Con&s;equence.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS LXIII, LXIV, LXV.</HEAD>
<P>I put the&s;e three Minutes together, becau&s;e they are all on the &s;ame Subject, <HI>viz.</HI> The Electing the Repre&s;entatives to the
<PB N="211" REF="498">
Parliament of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> which was now to be formed into an Act by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>There had been &s;everal Schemes of Elections laid down for the Peers, and three Overtures had been pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e&mdash;; Some were for Naming the &s;everal Fami|lies, and Fixing the Repre&s;entative to be Cho&s;en out of them Exclu&s;ively&mdash;, and the&s;e were tho&s;e who pretended to make Di&s;tinctions between the Ancient and Modern No|bility&mdash;; They thought it was rea&s;onable, &s;ince the Num|bers of Noblemen lately made, and e&s;pecially in the la&s;t Thirty or Fourty Years, were but burden&s;ome, as they al|ledged, to the Nation, that tho&s;e Families newly made Noble &s;hould relinqui&s;h this Affair to the Ancient Nobility, as what was Inherent in them, but a new Acce&s;&s;ion to the&s;e; and that, &s;ince <HI>Scotland</HI> was to Retrench her Nobility, as to &s;itting in Parliament, it was but ju&s;t they &s;hould be preferred, who had the mo&s;t Ancient Title.</P>
<P>Others were for dividing the Nobility into Four Cla&s;&s;es, and taking every Year a proportioned Number out of each Cla&s;s.</P>
<P>Others were for taking by Rotation, and &s;o, beginning at the Extremes, take the Families as they Ri&s;e, either be|ginning at the elde&s;t or younge&s;t Peers.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e Methods were rejected, and that of Election carryed it, whether it were, that each Party thought them|&s;elves able to carry it from the other, or that they thought it their Advantage, that they &s;hould carry it, who could make the be&s;t Intere&s;t I know not&mdash;; But I cannot &s;ay they took the be&s;t way for the pre&s;erving the publick Tran|quillity, &s;ince the Factions and Party-makings for the Intere&s;t of Elections, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the Con&s;equence of this Method, cannot but keep up a con&s;tant Feud of Parties and Families in the Nation, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be renew|ed every Three Year, the Parliament being to be new Cho&s;en &s;o often&mdash;; During which time, the Parties will be at Work, to Cultivate, Encrea&s;e, and Fortify their &s;e|veral Intere&s;ts, which, <HI>it is to be doubted,</HI> will go a great way to Entailing a Spirit of Divi&s;ion and Party-&s;trife upon the whole Nation&mdash;; I wi&s;h I may be found to have made a wrong Conjecture,&mdash;, but I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to &s;peak to this again in the Proce&s;s of this Story, and to ob|&s;erve, how too much of this was made good in the very fir&s;t Election, <HI>I mean,</HI> for the &s;econd <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament. Of which hereafter&mdash;.</P>
<P>After the &s;ettling of the Affair of the Peers, it was to be Determined how the Fourty Five Members for the Hou&s;e of Commons &s;hould be proportioned, and this was prepared for them before hand, and given in in a Scheme or Overture, which occa&s;ioned &s;ome Di&s;pute&mdash;; The number of the
<PB N="212" REF="499">
Shires and Counties and Stewartries that formerly Elected, were &leftblank; the&s;e were now to be reduced by joyn|ing Two or Three together, where they were &s;mall and re|mote, to Thirty Members, each County choo&s;ing none but One&mdash;, and each Head of Counties, where any were joyn|ed together, choo&s;ing but One&mdash;, the Burghs or Royal Burrows were &leftblank; in Number, the&s;e were Formed into Cla&s;&s;es or Di&s;tricts&mdash;, and were for each Di&s;trict to choo&s;e one Member; And becau&s;e the meeting together of the Votes in the &s;aid Burghs, might be both Chargeable and Inconvenient, a <HI>Medium</HI> was found out, each Burgh was to choo&s;e a Commi&s;&s;ioner, in the &s;ame manner as u&s;ual, which Commi&s;&s;ioner was to meet with the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the other Burghs of that Di&s;trict, and the&s;e were to choo&s;e the Mem|ber.</P>
<P>The re&s;pective Per&s;ons concerned, made &s;ome Oppo&s;ition about the Joyning of Shires&mdash;, but this had been a Thing well Concerted, and therefore admitted the le&s;s Di&s;pute in the Hou&s;e; the Per&s;ons al&s;o who had made the Calculations, being prepared to Defend the Equalities of it&mdash;; It re|mained therefore to agree on the Partition of the Counties and Towns, or as called in the Minutes, Barons and Burghs, which was done with little Di&s;pute, as <HI>per</HI> the Minute.</P>
<P>The Motion again&s;t the Elde&s;t Sons of Peers, had not a little to be &s;aid for it, particularly that when the Influence of the Nobility in <HI>Scotland</HI> comes to be con&s;idered, with the &s;mall Number of Members to be cho&s;en, it might in time to come ri&s;e to what was Hinted before, in the Project of reducing the Lords that did not &s;it in the Hou&s;e of Peers, to a Level with the Commons, and make them capable of &s;itting in the Hou&s;e of Commons, that then it might come to pa&s;s, that <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould be Repre&s;ented only by her Nobility, and that there &s;hould be <HI>Scots</HI> Lords in the Parliament of <HI>Britain;</HI> So here in time it might happen, that the Nobility in the Hou&s;e of Peers, and their Elde&s;t Sons in the Hou&s;e of Commons, might make up the whole Repre&s;entative of <HI>Scotland</HI>&mdash;.</P>
<P>There were a great many Arguments brought again&s;t this Propo&s;al, but the&s;e &s;eemed the mo&s;t prevailing, <HI>viz.</HI><LIST>
<ITEM>1. That it had been always allowed in <HI>Scotland</HI> before, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Elde&s;t Sons of Peers might be Elected.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That in <HI>England</HI> the Elde&s;t Sons of Peers do &s;it in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and it would break in upon the Rule of Equalities, to alter it, and put the <HI>Scots</HI> Gentlemen in a wor&s;e Condition than the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>After &s;ome time a Vote was offered that put it to an End, <HI>viz.</HI> To let the Right of being Elected remain ju&s;t as it was, without any Alteration at all, that he that had a Right or

<P>This Propo&s;al was ill received indeed, and a horrid Cla|mour rai&s;ed at it without Doors; The People who had been hot again&s;t the Union took hold of it with an Unbridled Railery, Reproaching the Treaters in a mo&s;t Indecent Man|ner, Exclaiming at the very Thing it &s;elf; Now the Nation might &s;ee they &s;aid what they had been doing at <HI>London,</HI> and what they had been pur&s;uing ever &s;ince that they had &s;old their Country for a Sum of Money, &amp; they were beginning to &s;hare it among them, this referred to the Equivalent out of which this Money was to be paid&mdash;; That they Voted for one another, the new Commi&s;&s;ioners and the old; and that this was taking that Money away to their private U&s;es, which they had pretended was to be Imployed in Incouraging the
<PB N="217" REF="504">
Manufactures and Imploying the Poor, Rai&s;ing Stocks for the Woollen Trade and Funds for the Fi&s;hing; That the&s;e were the &s;pecious Pretences, when the Nation was brought in to accept of the Equivalent, but that now it was done and over, now they were dividing the Spoil&mdash;; It would be endle&s;s to &s;et down the ill Nature of the Day, as &s;oon as this Propo&s;al was talked of without Doors, and yet there was really no Rea&s;on, the Gentlemen who went to <HI>England</HI> upon that Occa&s;ion, who &s;et all their private Affairs a&s;ide to &s;erve their Country, and attended in <HI>England</HI> &s;everal Months at Expence enough, &s;hould do all this at their own Charges, when, at the &s;ame time, every other Article had its Supply out of the General Fund; And therefore, notwith&s;tanding the Clamours of the People, and &s;everal Attempts within Doors, fir&s;t to reject it wholly, then to refu&s;e the payment of it out of the Equivalent, which was indeed refu&s;ing it wholly, &s;ince there was no other Fund to pay it&mdash;; And la&s;tly, to Re&s;trict the Quantity, yet at la&s;t it pa&s;t, as it had been at fir&s;t propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Allowance to the Old Treaters, they alledged, was a Trick to draw in the Allowance for the New, becau&s;e, be|ing to be Voted together, it was certain, <HI>the Old</HI> would Vote for the <HI>New,</HI> that they might be &s;ure, <HI>the New</HI> would, in Return, Vote for <HI>the Old</HI>&mdash;; But there was certainly the &s;ame Rea&s;on, that one &s;hould be allowed their Expence as the other, &s;ince, tho' they could not then bring it to a Conclu&s;ion, yet their Pains and Expences might not be the le&s;s, but rather the more for that, and thus they were both Vot|ed to be allowed their Charges, as <HI>per</HI> the Minute.</P>

<P>The Charges being allowed to the Treaters, it was thought the Hou&s;e would go on and allow this al&s;o, but it was pre|&s;ently rejected&mdash;; Some &s;aid it was offered by way of Je&s;t, as a Reproach to the Gentlemen that took Money for the Service of their Country.</P>
<P>But the Propo&s;al was made another way, <HI>viz. That no Repre&s;entative, from either Shire or Burgh, from this Kingdom to the Parliament of</HI> Great Britain, <HI>&s;hall have any Allowance for their Charges or Expences, &amp;c.</HI> It was alledged, That the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> took no &s;uch Allowance; and that it would be a Reproach
<PB N="219" REF="506">
to <HI>Scotland,</HI> if the <HI>Scots</HI> Gentry &s;hould take their Charges from the Country, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> did not.</P>
<P>To this it was An&s;wered, That, tho' the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentle|men generally refu&s;ed the Allowance of the Countries for their Attendance, yet that, by Law, there was &s;uch an Al|lowance due to them from the Countries, and they might not only ju&s;tify accepting it, but might legally demand it; And therefore it ought, in like manner, be left at Liberty in <HI>Scotland,</HI> when doubtle&s;s the <HI>Scots</HI> Repre&s;entatives, in Pro|portion to their Capacities, would be found as Frank and Ge|nerous in &s;paring the Country as the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>And it was remarkable, That in &s;ub&s;equent Elections in <HI>Scotland</HI> for the Counties, it was very often agreed joyntly by the &s;everal Candidates for Election, That who&s;oever carried it, &s;hould relinqui&s;h any pretence to an Allowance from the County, for their Service in Parliament.</P>
<P>The Affair of Proxies in Election of Peers, is expre&s;t at large in the Minute, and needs no Remark; nor was there any long Debate upon it in the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The other Heads al&s;o being Matter of Form, only were readily agreed to.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS LXX, &amp; LXXI.</HEAD>
<P>The Act for &s;ettling the manner of Electing the Repre&s;en|tative was now pa&s;t, and becau&s;e it is an Act containing a great Variety of Heads, u&s;eful for Po&s;terity to know, when the re&s;pective Elections may come on, I have in&s;erted it in the <HI>Appendix</HI> to this Work, <HI>N^o^.</HI> I x x.</P>
<P>The Overtures for Plantation of Kirks and Valuation of Teinds, were put both together, and proceeded upon as one Act, The ca&s;e was in &s;hort thus&mdash;; It had been the Cu&s;tom in former Parliaments, to Grant a Commi&s;&s;ion to
<PB N="221" REF="508">
certain of their own Members to &s;it as a Court, and to Judge and Determine of &s;everal Things relating to the two Heads above, viz. <HI>Plantation of Kirks and Valuation of Teinds;</HI> The Things they Determined of, were Generally,<LIST>
<ITEM>Sale and Valuation of Teinds or Tithes in the &s;everal Paroches.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Augmentation of the Stipends of Mini&s;ters.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Prorogation of Tacks, <HI>or Lea&s;es</HI> of Teinds.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Dividing or Disjoyning Paroches, <HI>or Pari&s;hes,</HI> where they where too large.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Erecting and Endowing New Churches.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Annexing and Di&s;membering Churches, and the like.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>It was &s;ome Time &s;ince the&s;e Commi&s;&s;ions had been Di&s;|continued, and that was not all the Misfortune, but all the Regi&s;ters and Rolls of that Court were lo&s;t in the great Fire which happened in the Parliament Clo&s;s at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> in the year 1700. So that there was no having Recour&s;e to any thing pa&s;t.</P>
<P>This was a great Lo&s;s to the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> upon &s;everal Accounts, and had it remained Un&s;ettled at this Juncture, the Injury had been pa&s;t Remedy; Wherefore it was earne&s;tly De&s;ir'd, and readily Granted, That all the Powers formerly Exerci&s;ed by the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ion of Parliament, &s;hould now be Conveyed to &s;ome particular Court Judica|tory or Body of Men, that &s;hould Judge and Determine in &s;uch Ca&s;es; &s;ome were for having it Ve&s;ted in the Church it &s;elf, and committed to the General A&s;&s;embly&mdash;; But it was alledged, That were to make the Church Judge in Her own Cau&s;e, and put too much Power into the Hands of the A&s;&s;embly; Others were for De&s;iring it to be in the Hands of the Crown, to Grant Commi&s;&s;ion to proper Per&s;ons, as the Parliament did before&mdash;; But that was Objected again&s;t, as dangerous to the Safety and Con&s;titution of the Church; at length it was Devolved on the Lords of the Se&s;&s;ion, and there it pa&s;t, as in the Act Printed al&s;o at large in the <HI>Ap|pendix N^o^.</HI> K x x.</P>
<P>The Committee al&s;o now made their Report about the Coin, and the manner of &s;ettling it the Time of Reducing and Calling in the Money, of which I have &s;poken already&mdash;; but the Report of the Committee being recited in the Proclamation, and that Proclamation &s;tating the particulars exactly, I have placed the &s;aid Proclamation in the <HI>Appendix N^o^.</HI> L x x. It being the la&s;t Proclamation al&s;o made in <HI>Scot|land</HI> as a &s;eparate Kingdom.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS LXXV, LXXVI, LXXVII.</HEAD>
<P>The Church Act about Kirks and Teinds was now &s;ettled, the Motion of having the&s;e things &s;till referred to a Parlia|mentary Commi&s;&s;ion was thought to proceed from the&s;e, who were willing it &s;hould remain in the &s;ame Condition it had lyen in for a long time, <HI>viz. &V;n&s;ettled and &V;nprovided for,</HI> &s;ince it mu&s;t yearly put the Per&s;ons concerned to make Appli|cation to the Parliament of <HI>Britain,</HI> which was Remote, and very Trouble&s;ome to get &s;uch Commi&s;&s;ion &s;ettled, or Triennial|ly at lea&s;t&mdash;; And whereas, while it lay before their own Parliament, it had, for &s;ome Years, been Un&s;ettled; and the Church left, as it were, Unregarded in tho&s;e Affairs, it might much more be &s;uppo&s;ed to be neglected, if referred to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament&mdash;; That, at the end of every Par|liament, which, at furthe&s;t, would be but Three Years, this
<PB N="227" REF="514">
Matter behoved to be laid before them again, and diligent|ly &s;olicited, in order to have it effectually &s;ettled&mdash;; This therefore was vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed, and it was carryed to be referred to the Lords of the Se&s;&s;ion, as <HI>per</HI> the Act. <HI>Vide</HI> the <HI>Appendix, N^o.</HI> K <HI>xx.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Proemiums</HI> and Drawbacks on the Exportation of Corn had been &s;ettled, as before is ob&s;erved, and are in&s;ert|ed in the Union, as <HI>per</HI> the Act appears; But, in regard the Union was not to take place till <HI>May,</HI> and the want of tho&s;e Allowances might put a Stop to the Exportation in the mean time, and particularly, That there was a great <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet and &s;everal <HI>Norway</HI> Ships in the Port of <HI>Leith</HI> at that time, which would, in ca&s;e of the Encouragements now to be given, car|ry away a great Quantity of Corn, before the Fir&s;t of <HI>May,</HI> which Exportation of Corn would be a great Advantage to the Counny, therefore this &s;hort lived Act was propo&s;ed for the Encouragement of Trade: But it was alledged, That the Term of the Commencement of the Union was &s;o near, that no Convoy would &s;tir, or Ships &s;ail, before that time would be come, and the Advantages would be the &s;ame to the Merchant; Upon which, the Bill was dropp'd in the Hou&s;e, and came to nothing.</P>
<P>The Debate about the Chirurgeons and Apothecaries, never came to any Head, the De&s;ign was to Authorize the Apothecaries and Chirurgeones, to Admini&s;ter Phy&s;ick with|out the A&s;&s;i&s;tance or Pre&s;cription of the Phy&s;icians, in Ex|traordinary ca&s;es&mdash;; It would have been perhaps a a conte&s;ted Thing, if the Hou&s;e had been of longer Con|tinuance, but the End of the Parliament being &s;o near, there was no Time for it.</P>
<P>The Act about Kirk-lands, and Di&s;charging the Feu-duties, was a nece&s;&s;ary Law at that Time, in &s;ome &s;pecial Cau&s;es, and met with no Oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e &s;at on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the Twentieth of <HI>February,</HI> but was wholly Imployed about private Bu&s;ine&s;s, which I have all along Omitted, as not to the purpo&s;e; on the Twenty Fir&s;t they did little, but read the Bill about Prohibiting Mu&s;ters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and pa&s;t it with the Church Act.</P>

<P>The Committee had now &s;ettled the Sum, which in the Gro&s;s was to be paid to the Proprietors of the <HI>African</HI> Com|pany; the Que&s;tion that remained, was, by what Method it &s;hould be Di&s;tributed, and to whom it &s;hould be paid&mdash;; Two Motions were made about it.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That it &s;hould be paid out by the Commi&s;&s;ioners who were to be appointed for the general Di&s;tribution of the Equivalent, and by them immediately paid to the Per&s;ons, who had a Right to the payment by Act of Par|liament.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Some thought this was Di&s;honourable to the Di|rectors of the Company, and they moved, that they &s;hould appoint Per&s;ons to Receive and Di&s;tribute the Money, but this la&s;t met with very little Approbation.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I care not to take notice of &s;ome Di&s;putes that happened upon this Occa&s;ion, becau&s;e they &s;eemed to make Per&s;onal Reflections&mdash;; and only &s;ignified, that &s;ome People were more Jealous of one another, than I hope there was occa&s;ion for on either Side&mdash;; But it was evident, the People who were to receive the Money, were Generally mo&s;t Concerned to have it paid them by the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Equivalent immediately, as being the &s;ure&s;t Method, and &s;o it was at la&s;t agreed.</P>
<P>The Money being thus Directed, and who &s;hould have the payment, it is not Material to take notice of the &s;everal Claims put in, Debts demanded of the Company, and Services to be rewarded, they were all matter of private Intere&s;t, and I omit them of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The Affair of the Coyn, and the Report of the Committee, I have Noted already, and as it i&s;&s;ued in a Proclamation, and that Proclamation recited the Report of the Committee, I have in&s;erted the whole in the <HI>Appendix N^o</HI> L x x.</P>
<P>On the Seventeenth the Act for the payment of the Capi|tal and Intere&s;t of the <HI>African</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Company was read, &amp; little more but private Bu&s;ine&s;s was done, the Union was now Fini&s;hed in <HI>England,</HI> and expected down every day, &amp; the Par|liament, &s;aving the di&s;patch of &s;ome private Bills, had no|thing

<P>Then my Lord Commi&s;&s;ioner made the following Speeech, <HI>viz.</HI> My Lords and Gentlemen, <HI>I have received by Her Maje&s;ties Command an Exemplification, under the Great Seal of</HI> England, <HI>of the Act pa&s;t in the Parliament of that Kingdom, Ratifying the Treaty of &V;nion in the &s;ame terms as the Treaty was pa&s;t here.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Her Maje&s;ty orders it to be in&s;erted in the Books of Parliament, and to remain with the Records of this Kingdom; for which end I have put it in my Lord Clerk Registers Hand.</HI></P>
<P>My Lords and Gentlemen, <HI>It is a great &s;atisfaction to the Queen that the &V;nion is thus happily concluded in Her Reign, and I'm com|manded by Her Maje&s;ty to a&s;&s;ure you, that nothing &s;hall be omitted on Her part, to make the whole I&s;land feel the good Effects of it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And as I doubt not but the fini&s;hing of this great Affair is acceptable to you, &s;o I hope you will &s;tudy to promote a cordial &V;nion with our Neigh|bours, for the greater Happine&s;s and Advantage of both Kingdoms.</HI></P>
<P>Then the Exemplification of the <HI>Act</HI> of the Parliament of <HI>Eng|land</HI> ratifying the Treaty of Union betwixt <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> under the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> was read, and ordered to be re|corded.</P>

<ITEM>1. Delay and length of Time, in Debating and Di&s;|puting, with Amendments, <HI>Conferences,</HI> and <HI>free Con|ferences</HI> between the Upper and Lower Hou&s;e of Parlia|ment in <HI>England,</HI> according to the known Way and U&s;age, in Ca&s;es of &s;uch Difficulty as this was.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Amendments or Alterations, which might occa&s;i|on the re&s;pective Articles &s;o Amended, to be Remitted or Returned to the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> to be Recon|&s;idered, by which means not the particular Articles only, but perhaps the whole Treaty might nece&s;&s;arily go thro' the Hands of the Parliament in <HI>Scotland</HI> again, and &s;o the Time which began to approach, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>First</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> at which Time the Union was to take place, &s;hould be Elap&s;ed; and &s;o it might be put off to another Parliament, and the Work be to be done over again.</ITEM>

<HEAD>APPENDIX, Part I. Containing an Account of Tran&s;actions in both Parts of the United Kingdoms, &s;ub|&s;equent to the <HI>UNION;</HI> being an Abridg|ment of the &s;everal Alterations made in the Laws, Trade, Cu&s;toms, and Con&s;ti|tution of both Kingdoms by the <HI>Union.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Union was no &s;onner Concluded, and the Ratifications Exchanged, as has been &s;aid, but an unlucky Bu&s;ine&s;s hap|pened, that opened afre&s;h the Mouths of tho&s;e that had all along watched Occa&s;ions for that purpo&s;e, and furni&s;hed them with matter of new Clamour. The particulars are as follows;</P>
<P>The Time when the Union was to take place, was the fir&s;t of <HI>May,</HI> after which, by the Fourth Article of the Treaty, the Sub|jects of either Kingdom were to have a free Intercour&s;e of Trade, to enjoy equal Privileges, and were to be upon an equal Foot as to Taxes, Cu&s;toms, Duties, Prohibitions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as by Words of the Treaty, <HI>viz.</HI> Article 4<HI>th.</HI></P>
<Q>That all the Subjects of the &V;nited Kingdom of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> &s;hall, from and after the &V;nion, have full Freedom and Intercour&s;e of Trade and Navigation, to and from any Port or Place within the &s;aid &V;nited Kingdom, and the Dominions and Plantations thereunto be|longing; And that there be a Communication of all other Rights, Pri|vileges and Advantages, which do, or may belong to the Subjects of ei|ther Kingdom, except where it is otherways expre&s;ly agreed in the&s;e Ar|ticles.</Q>
<P>But in the Interval of Time, between the fini&s;hing of the Treaty and the fir&s;t of <HI>May,</HI> all Things by Con&s;equence remained as they were, and all Merchandizes being Imported into <HI>Scotland</HI> upon the Foot of the former Cu&s;toms, which were much Lower than in <HI>England,</HI> the Merchants in both Kingdoms laying hold of that Advantage, for their private Gain, Fraughted abundance of Ships in <HI>France</HI> and
<PB N="2" REF="563">
<HI>Holland</HI> with all &s;orts of Goods, which payed high Duties in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> Landing them in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and paying only the <HI>Scots</HI> Dues, pre&s;uming that after the fir&s;t of <HI>May,</HI> they &s;hould be &s;ent Free to <HI>England,</HI> according to the general Article of Freedom of Com|merce.</P>
<P>To let the Reader more Exactly into this Ca&s;e, I &s;hall &s;tate the difference of the Duties of &s;ome of the &s;everal Commodities, which being thus Imported into <HI>Scotland,</HI> were after to be carried into <HI>England;</HI> &s;uch as, Wines, Brandies, Salt, Lint&s;eed, Iron, Timber, Deals, <HI>&amp;c</HI> being the chief kinds of Goods Imported in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and which the Duties were mo&s;t Complained of.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, it is to be ob&s;erved, That the Cu&s;toms of <HI>Scotland</HI> being Let in Tack, <HI>as they call it</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or in Farm, <HI>as in England,</HI> the Tack&s;men or Farmers, to Encourage the Merchants to make large Importations, made &s;everal Compo&s;itions and Abatements to them le&s;s or more, according as the Quantity of the Goods Imported, Encouraged, by this means the Cu&s;toms were &s;till reduced, and yet the Farmers of the Cu&s;toms made great Gain of that Interval of Trade.</P>
<P>Another Article of the Contrivance of the Merchants on this Head, was in <HI>England,</HI> upon the Drawbacks on Foreign Goods Imported there, and Exported again by Certificate.</P>
<P>And this indeed was le&s;s Hone&s;t by far than the other, tho' both of them Politick enough; and, which was thought, had &s;lipt the Notice of the Treaters on both &s;ides, during the Negotiating the Treaty.</P>
<P>The Exporters in this Ca&s;e, &s;ent Goods from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Scot|land</HI> by Certificate, drawing back the Duties paid on their Import in <HI>England,</HI> as being &s;ent to a Foreign Country: After the Union the Kingdoms becoming One, it was by the Treaty left open for them, to carry the &s;ame Goods back into <HI>England,</HI> and Sell them there, as if they had paid the Duty.</P>
<P>The principal Article this Circum&s;tance relates to, was Tobacco, which paying a large Duty of near Six Pence <HI>per</HI> Pound in <HI>England,</HI> above Six Thou&s;and Hog&s;heads as I have been told, <HI>(Some have &s;aid much more, even to double the Quantity, but I choo&s;e to relate the lowe&s;t Number,)</HI> was &s;ent into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and 5 <HI>per</HI> Pound of the &s;aid Cu&s;tom drawn back by the Merchant.</P>
<P>I need not acquaint the Reader, That the Exporter was both bound in a Bond with Securities, and al&s;o Sworn again&s;t the Re|landing or returning it into <HI>England</HI> again; But as the Union gave a free Intercour&s;e of Trade, <HI>i. e.</HI> Exporting and Importing to and from the re&s;pective Kingdoms, without paying any Duties, or any Mole&s;tation what&s;oever, &s;o their Bonds &s;eem'd to be of no Value in that Ca&s;e; But whether the Oath was of no Value to them, is ano|ther Affair, and not for me to Determine here.</P>
<P>It is evident, the Tobacco was &s;ent to <HI>Scotland</HI> in Quantities, &s;o much above the u&s;ual Con&s;umption of that Country, that it

could rationally be e&s;teemed to be with no other Pro&s;pect, than of Returning it into <HI>England</HI> again after the Union, and &s;o to obtain the Advantage of the Drawback.</P>
<P>In like manner it is evident, the great Import into <HI>Scotland</HI> of Wines and Brandy from <HI>France,</HI> either directly, or by way of <HI>Hol|land,</HI> was &s;o much beyond the ordinary Con&s;umption of the Place, that it could be with no other End, than the carrying it into <HI>Eng|land</HI> after the Union &s;hould take place, nor did the Merchants &s;tick to owne that to be in the De&s;ign.</P>
<P>The Merchants in <HI>London,</HI> e&s;pecially &s;uch as were concerned in the Trade to <HI>Spain, Italy</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> and con&s;equently had the greate&s;t Injury, made loud Complaints of this, as an Intolerable In|equality, and a Thing &s;o Unju&s;t that they made no doubt to con|cern the Government in it, and the Parliament being then &s;itting, they Addre&s;&s;ed the Hou&s;e of Commons for Relief.</P>
<P>Their Addre&s;s was followed with Numerous Solicitations, they even wearied the Members, the Secretaries of State, and every Body, that they thought would E&s;pou&s;e their Cau&s;e; that as &s;ome have Expre&s;&s;ed it, They almo&s;t drove the Hou&s;e by the Force of their Clamours, upon a Debate of a Thing, which mo&s;t People thought they had really no Power, <HI>at lea&s;t no Rea&s;on,</HI> to meddle with.</P>
<P>The Parliament then &s;itting was the &s;ame, which had in Concert with the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> made this Union; And it could not &s;eem Rea&s;onable, That the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> in its &s;eparate Capacity, could be Qualified to Explain any part of the Articles, which were then Ratified and Recorded in both Kingdoms, and neither Parliament could Determine in Things belonging to the other, any more than they could have done before the Treaty.</P>
<P><HI>However this was,</HI> the Hou&s;e of Commons went upon it, great Application being made by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants, and after &s;ome Debate, came to this Re&s;olution.<Q><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI>
<P>That the Importation of Goods and Merchandizes of the Growth and Produce of <HI>France,</HI> and other Forreign Parts into <HI>Scotland,</HI> in order to be brought from thence into <HI>England</HI> after the fir&s;t of <HI>May,</HI> and with Intention to avoid the payment of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Duties, will be to the Damnage &amp; Ruine of the Fair Traders, to the Prejudice of the Manufactures of <HI>England,</HI> a great Lo&s;s to Her Maje&s;ties Revenue of the Customs, and a very great Detriment to the Publick.</P></Q></P>
<P>And in pur&s;uance of this Re&s;olution, a Bill was ordered to be brought in, the Enacting part of which I have Annexed to this Work, in the <HI>Appendsx N^o^.</HI> C (3). The Title of it was as follows.<Q>A Bill to prevent the Mi&s;chiefs of a Fraudulent Practice, in obtaining Drawbacks for Goods carried from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Scotland,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="565">
in order to be brought back again; and in carrying Goods from For|eign Parts into <HI>Scotland,</HI> in order to be brought into <HI>England,</HI> without paying the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Duties, and for better &s;ecuring the Du|ties of Goods brought from the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> was (according to order) read a &s;econd time, and committed to a Committee of the whole Hou&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>This Bill pa&s;t all the u&s;ual Forms in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and went up to the Lords, but after long Debate in the &V;pper-Hou&s;e, the Lords rejected it.</P>
<P>It's true, that upon the Petitions and Repre&s;entations of the <HI>Scots</HI> Merchants, there were long Debates, and great Difficulties in the pa&s;|&s;ing this Bill in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and the <HI>Scots</HI> demanding <HI>by the Letter of the Treaty</HI> a free Intercour&s;e of Trade, alledged they could not be refu&s;ed the importing of any Goods out of <HI>Scotland</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> which were not by Law Counterband in <HI>Scotland</HI> before the &s;aid Treaty, &s;ince having been fairly admitted to an Entry in the Cu|&s;tom-hou&s;e of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and all the Duties which were demanded be|ing paid, the free Intercour&s;e of Trade between the Nations immedi|ately opened all the Ports of <HI>England</HI> to their Goods.</P>
<P>This Argument was too Powerful and too Plain not to have its Weight in the Hou&s;e: <HI>But to &s;olve this,</HI> there was an Exception put in to the Bill for the Property of <HI>Scots</HI> Merchants, as a thing which would effectually remove their Scruples, and an&s;wer the End both of the Union one way, and of the <HI>Portugal</HI> Merchants another; For the Complaint &s;eemed to ly not &s;o much again&s;t the Freedom of <HI>Scots</HI> Merchants importing their own Goods, but of Forreigners, <HI>Dutch, French, Jews</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who under the cover of <HI>Scots</HI> Men had crouded in va&s;t Quantities of Wine and Brandy, meerly to evade paying the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Dutie, taking the Advantage of the Interval of Time, and thereby bringing their Goods to Market upon Terms va&s;tly diffe|ring from the cour&s;e of Trade.</P>
<P>To prevent this, the Act was to provide, that all the Properties of the <HI>Scots</HI> Merchants &s;hould be exempted, and be allowed to come to <HI>England,</HI> but this was re&s;tricted in point of Proof. (1.) The <HI>onus Probandi</HI> lay upon the Merchant, in which many Niceties occurred needle&s;s to be mentioned here. (2.) None were to be reputed <HI>Scots</HI> Merchants but &s;uch as re&s;ided in <HI>Scotland,</HI> this excluded the <HI>Scots</HI> Merchants at <HI>London</HI> and in <HI>Holland,</HI> who were deeply Embarke in the&s;e Importations, and on who&s;e Management the chief part of the De&s;ign was charged. (3.) The Proof of the Importations and Properties lay before the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Cu&s;toms, and it was doubtful how it &s;hould be determin'd.</P>
<P>Under all the&s;e Difficulties, with other Re&s;trictions needle&s;s here, this fir&s;t Act &s;truggl'd and pa&s;t the Commons, and yet it was thought al&s;o, that had the <HI>Scots</HI> been fairly excepted they would have been well enough plea&s;ed with &s;uch a Difference, and they would have had &s;ome rea&s;on to have been &s;o; Nor was the Exception of For|reigners altogether unrea&s;onable, the thing being really a Fraud in
<PB N="5" REF="566">
Trade, and a Hard&s;hip upon the fair Traders: But the main Ob|jection turn'd upon another Point, <HI>viz. The Power the Parliament of</HI> England <HI>alone could have to Determine, Construe, or Explain any one of the Articles of the &V;nion, which being made by the Concurrence of the two re&s;pective Kingdoms, could not be &s;ubject to the Cogni&s;ance of either Parliament in its &s;eparate Capacitie,</HI> and upon this Head the Lords rejected the Bill. And this being the main thing in my Ob&s;er|vation, on which the whole Ca&s;e depended, I have purpo&s;ly omitted the Rea&s;onings on that Article on either &s;ide, which were very many, referring my Reader to the Sub&s;tance of the Addre&s;s of the <HI>Scots</HI> Merchants to the Hou&s;e of Lords, and to an Ob&s;ervation made by an eminent Member of the Parliament, which I have added in the <HI>Ap|pendix,</HI> in order to leave this Ca&s;e as clear to Po&s;terity as is po&s;&s;ible, marked N^o (<HI>D</HI>3.) and N^o (<HI>E</HI>3.)</P>
<P>However it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary if po&s;&s;ible to bring this Affair to &s;ome Conclu&s;ion, and in order to this the Parliament at that time draw|ing near an end, for they could &s;it no longer than the la&s;t of <HI>April,</HI> the Union commencing the 1<HI>&s;t.</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> wherefore it was thought expedient to give the Hou&s;e a &s;hort Rece&s;s, that this matter might come again upon the Stage, whereupon the Queen prorogued the Parliament for three days only, and in a &s;hort Speech made them acquainted with the Rea&s;on of it, <HI>viz.</HI> In order to find out an Expedient to prevent any Mi&s;chiefs ari&s;ing to either Kingdom in the &s;hort Interval of time between that and the Commencement of the &V;nion.</P>
<P>When the Hou&s;e met again, the Commons began again and voted to the &s;ame purpo&s;e as before, and ordered a Bill to be brought in in the &s;ame terms as before.</P>
<P>The Vote of the Hou&s;e of Commons ran thus;<Q>That the Importation of &s;undry Goods of the Growth of <HI>France</HI> thro' <HI>Scotland</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> with de&s;ign to avoid paying the Duties payable for the &s;ame in <HI>England,</HI> is a notorious Fraud, ruinous to the fair Tra|ders and injurious to Her Majesties Revenue.</Q></P>
<P>&V;pon this Vote the Merchants at <HI>London</HI> renewed their Clamours, and all Methods po&s;&s;ible were made u&s;e of to bring the Parliament in|to it; The Government would willingly have foundout &s;ome Expe|dient to have &s;oftned the general Complaint, and to have prevented the Injury to the Revenue, but all <HI>Mediums</HI> were found imperfect, and the Hou&s;e of Lords per&s;i&s;ting in the fir&s;t Scruple, it fell to the Ground.</P>
<P>While this was tran&s;acting, the Merchants went on with their Importation, and tho' the Quantity did not amount to what had been alledged <HI>would be brought in,</HI> yet it was a very great Quantity indeed, and the Damage to the Revenue in <HI>England,</HI> appears by the follow|ing Calculation.</P>
<P>There were not &s;ome wanting in either Kingdom, who expected to make early Objections again&s;t this proceeding, as a Breach of the
<PB N="6" REF="567">
Union on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ide, and had the Act pa&s;t, tho' with the ut|mo&s;t Precautions, di&s;covered that they would have improved that Sugge&s;tion to the utmo&s;t, and yet it was ob&s;ervable that none were &s;o forward to approve of the Act of Re&s;triction as &s;ome Gentlemen who declared their Aver&s;ion to the Union, and their willingne&s;s to have it di&s;&s;olved again.</P>
<P>Whatever Lo&s;s therefore the Government received by this Affair, they avoided the Stroke it would have given to the Union and the Enemies of the Treaty lo&s;t the Opportunity of &s;aying it was broken.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of <HI>May</HI> being arriv'd, the <HI>Scots</HI> Merchants began to apply them&s;elves to the Government for the Settlement of this Matter, and the Importation of their Goods to <HI>England;</HI> This held a long De bate, and took up a great deal of time, however the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;hipped their Goods, took Certificats in <HI>Scotland</HI> of their being fairly im|ported there before the fir&s;t of <HI>May,</HI> and tho' after many He&s;itations and Delays, about the middle of <HI>June</HI> the Fleet &s;ailed for <HI>London,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of about 40 Sail mo&s;tly loaded with Wine and Brandy:</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they arrived in the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e Officers made a general Seizure both of Ship and Goods; and all was put to a full &s;top.</P>
<P>This perplex'd the Merchands very much, and loud Clamours were made of it in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as a Breach of the &V;nion; The Royal Bor|roughs in <HI>Scotland</HI> held their Convention upon this Affair, and the Merchants concerned in the &s;aid Ships pre&s;ented a Petition to them, which becau&s;e it relates the Complaint in expre&s;s terms, and for the Information of tho&s;e People in <HI>England,</HI> who do not particularly un|der&s;tand the Methods there, I in&s;ert at large in the <HI>Appendix.</HI></P>
<P>It may be ob&s;erved that the Royal Burghs in <HI>Scotland</HI> have their Meetings on emergent Occa&s;ions, for the Regulation of Trade, and &s;ettling their own Affairs, be&s;ides their Annual Meeting.</P>
<P>The Merchants of <HI>Scotland</HI> generally &s;peaking are all Free-men of &s;ome one or other of the&s;e Burghs, and there hapning to be a Con|vention or Meeting as above at that time, the Merchants pre&s;ented to them their Petition, intreating them to repre&s;ent their Ca&s;e to the Queen, &s;etting furth their Grievances, this Petition you will find in the <HI>Appendix</HI> N^o <HI>A.</HI> (3.)</P>
<P>Pur&s;uant to this Petition, the Convention of Burroughs repre&s;ented their ca&s;e very earne&s;tly to the Government, by the means of the <HI>Scots</HI> Secretarys of State then at <HI>London</HI>&mdash;their Addre&s;s I have al&s;o placed in the <HI>Appendix</HI> to this Work N^o <HI>B</HI> (3)</P>
<P>And thus the Ca&s;e was wholly referred to the Queen and Council.</P>
<P>It was thought hard indeed that the Ships &s;hould not be &s;uffered to unlade, the Sea&s;on being Hot, and the Wines expo&s;ed to &s;poil; But there was no immediate Remedy, the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e Officers could not po&s;&s;ibly do otherwi&s;e, <HI>for this Rea&s;on:</HI> Had the Debate been, what Duty they &s;hould pay, they might have &s;uffered them to un|lade into the Queens Ware-hou&s;es, and have detained them there till &s;uch Duty had been paid; But the Trade of <HI>France</HI> being univer&s;al|ly
<PB N="7" REF="568">
Prohibit by Act of Parliament, they could not be admitted to an Entry, but were all Forfeited, both Ships and Goods.</P>
<P>The Government willing, if po&s;&s;ible, to give the nece&s;&s;ary Relief in this Exigence, the Attorney General, and all other Judges, who&s;e Advice was nece&s;&s;ary, were required to give their Opinion, but they differ'd in their Judgments &s;o much, that no Re&s;olution could be made in it.</P>
<P>However, that the Merchants might be made Ea&s;ie, it was pro|po&s;ed to them, That they &s;hould Land their Goods, upon Condi|tion, that they gave Security to &s;tand to the Judgment of the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Parliament; This was thought but rea&s;onable, and &s;ome com|plyed with it, and had their Ships Unloaden: Others refu&s;ed &s;uch Securities, and their Goods lay longer, and &s;uffered more.</P>
<P>At length a <HI>Medium</HI> was found out, which was, to let all the Merchants have the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Goods, &s;erving the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the Goods with a Writ of <HI>Devenirunt</HI> out of the Exche|quer&mdash;; This is a kind of Write which puts the Matter in a Form of Pro&s;ecution only, that in ca&s;e of further occa&s;ion, the Queen might recover her Dues, and &s;o the Merchants had their Goods, and the Deci&s;ion of it was left to Time, and to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament.</P>
<P>Thus it continued in a Cour&s;e of Law, tho' not under pro&s;ecu|cution, till the Meeting of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, when by a Vote of the Hou&s;e of Commons, the whole Affair was Di&s;charged, and all pro&s;ecutions ordered to be &s;topt, of which hereafter. Mean time the Clau&s;e in Parliament &s;o much &s;truggled about, you will find in the <HI>Appendix</HI> to this Work, <HI>N^o</HI> C (3)</P>
<P>Thus ended this difficult Matter, in which is to be Noted the Exactne&s;s of the Hou&s;e of Lords, and Tenderne&s;s in re&s;pect to the Union, which delivered us from the Apprehen&s;ions of an Inva&s;ion upon the Articles; and notwith&s;tanding the Damage done to the Revenue, which was finally &s;acrificed to the Ea&s;e of the Peoples Minds, the whole Claim was let fall.</P>
<P>It may be thought it had this U&s;e, however, that the Difficulty which appeared in it, Checkt the Quantity of the Goods that would otherways have been brought in, which would have been Intole|rable, and &s;ome thought this was part of the De&s;ign in it.</P>
<P>while this was Tran&s;acting, the Government began to take the State of the Nation into their Con&s;ideration, in order to &s;ettle Things conform to the re&s;pective Con&s;titutions, and yet to put the Union as far in Practice as the General Circum&s;tances would admit; And this took up the mo&s;t part of the Time between the fir&s;t of <HI>May, when the &V;nion took place,</HI> and the Sitting down of the fir&s;t <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, nor was the Thing without its Difficulties, as will appear in the &s;everal Articles following.<LIST>

<P>Previous to the&s;e Particulars, it is requi&s;ite to ob&s;erve, That the Admini&s;tration of publick. Affairs was left to remain as before, in the Mini&s;try of a Privy Council, a Trea&s;ury, a Chancellor, and Two Secretaries of State, with all other Dependents and Sub&s;titutes as before.</P>
<P>This the Queen thought fit to Order, not only, becau&s;e the Weight of Bu&s;ine&s;s was too great, and the particulars too Nice, and of too much Con&s;equence to &s;uffer a &s;udden Change, which would have made large Intervals in the Cour&s;e of Admini&s;tration, put a &s;top to the publick Bu&s;ine&s;s, and Influence private Per&s;ons Affairs al&s;o. But as the Queen has always thought it be&s;t, in &s;uch Ca&s;es, to take Advice of Her Great Council the Parliament, a Hap|pine&s;s we have often Complained for want of in former Reigns; So it was referred to the Sitting of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, that it might be &s;ettled, to the Satisfaction of the Nation, by the Advice of their full Repre&s;entative.</P>
<P>Thus the Civil Li&s;t remained as it was, the Army was &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted upon the old E&s;tabli&s;hment, and paid from the Ce&s;s granted by the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as far as it Extended, the Defici|ency was left to the Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI> to &s;upply, as appears by the Act of Parliament granting the Ce&s;s.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of <HI>May One Thou&s;and Seven Hundred and Eight,</HI> the Army received their pay from <HI>London,</HI> the Regiment of Foot Guards was received as <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Guards, and the Command of them given to the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Lothian</HI> as Colonel; The Guards were Clothed after the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> manner, I mean, as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Guards, and the whole E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Forces received their Regulati|ons and Pay from the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Government.</P>
<P>But two Things required an immediate Application, <HI>viz.</HI> The Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;e, for the&s;e being to be E&s;tabli&s;hed upon a new Foot, <HI>viz.</HI> According to the Articles, and to Commence preci&s;ely on the fir&s;t of <HI>May,</HI> it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould be fir&s;t &s;ettled.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Rea&s;ons made it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to bring down &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> to &s;upply Inferiour Offices, both in the Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;e, at lea&s;t, till proper Per&s;ons might be found, or In|&s;tructed to Act without them.</P>
<P>It was thought at fir&s;t, That as <HI>Scotland</HI> being United to <HI>England,</HI> the whole United Kingdom coming under one Denomination, and under one Method of Government, &s;o the Revenues &s;hould become
<PB N="9" REF="570">
united in one general Collection, that the Cu&s;toms &s;hould be manag|ed by the Commi&s;&s;ioners at <HI>London,</HI> and under them only by Collec|tors and other Officers in the re&s;pective Ports in <HI>Scotland</HI> as it is in <HI>En|gland,</HI> all &s;ub&s;ervient to, and under the Government of the Commi&s;|&s;ioners at <HI>London,</HI> and the like in the Exci&s;e.</P>
<P>But the Bu&s;ine&s;s appeared too weighty and embarra&s;t with too many Difficulties to admit of &s;uch a Conjunction, and indeed were I to enter into an Hi&s;torical Account of the Labyrinths which the fir&s;t Settlement of the&s;e Duties led the Managers of them into, what Dif|ficulties they met with, what Clamours were rai&s;ed at their Conduct, however impartially they endeavoured to act, it would look as if I were going to Write of per&s;ons in&s;tead of relating things, and that is none of my bu&s;ine&s;s here.</P>
<P>It will be enough here to touch the matters of Fact, by which it will appear, both that the Government proceeded in the be&s;t Me|thod, in puting the Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;e into a di&s;tinct Management in <HI>Scotland;</HI> And al&s;o, that the Commi&s;&s;ioners of both &s;hewed they wanted neither Judgment or Application in a Settlement &s;o &s;peedy under &s;uch perplext Circum&s;tances as they found the&s;e Revenues in at fir&s;t.</P>

<P>The whole Extent of the Kingdom lay before them and they had not only new Officers to place in the re&s;pective Ports, but they had all their old Officers to in&s;truct in the new Methods, Cu&s;toms and Manner of &s;ecuring and accounting the re&s;pective Duties.</P>
<P>This obliged the Government, even before Commi&s;&s;ioners were named, and before the time for the new Collection began, to di|rect five per&s;ons from <HI>England,</HI> experienced in the Methods and &V;|&s;age of the Cu&s;toms, to go down into <HI>Scotland,</HI> to put them into &s;ome manner of Order as to Exports and Imports, e&s;pecially of Goods to be pa&s;&s;ed between the two Kingdoms when the Union was to take place, and of Imports which might happen before the Commi&s;&s;ion came down; As al&s;o to Regulate the Collection of the &s;ub&s;equent Duties, &s;ecure the Payment, and in&s;truct the Officers; And this was about the latter end of <HI>April.</HI>&mdash;If the Di&s;orders the&s;e Gentle|men found the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e in, the Confu&s;ion of Method and Remi&s;|ne&s;s of Practice was material to note in a Hi&s;tory, it would take up a large Di&s;cour&s;e here, and make the nece&s;&s;ity of a new modelling the Cu&s;tom hou&s;e more di&s;tinctly appear.</P>

<P>The fir&s;t Clamour I meet with again&s;t the&s;e proceedings, was, the filling all the Commi&s;&s;ions up with <HI>Engli&s;h Men</HI> and Strangers, and I mention it, not that it was a real Ground of Complaint, their Num|ber being not one fifth Part of the whole, as appears by their E&s;ta|bli&s;hment; But to remark how readily every thing was laid hold upon to reproach the &V;nion, as being either originally de&s;igned for, or con&s;equentially improved to the particular Advantage of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;eparately con&s;idered.</P>
<P>Now altho' the &s;mall Number of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> imployed in the Cu&s;toms, were a &s;ufficient An&s;wer to the Objections, and a full Ju&s;tification of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government in that Ca&s;e; yet it is a more clear Defence when it is con&s;idered that it was impo&s;&s;ible to introduce the new Method of collection, the Rules of their keeping their &s;everal Offices, and their Accompts, which were all now to be done after the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manner, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Officers from <HI>England,</HI> who had been bred up to the &s;ame Bu&s;ine&s;s, and were ab&s;olutely Ma&s;ters of the Methods practi&s;ed in <HI>England:</HI> of which by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>But to return to the Que&s;tion, I mean the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;eparate Collection of the Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;e in <HI>Scotland,</HI> it will further appear in reflecting on the Proceedings of the Officers in the pro&s;ecution of their new Methods.</P>
<P>For Fir&s;t, the People finding the Duties on <HI>French</HI> Goods &s;o ex|travagantly high, that the &s;tealing the Cu&s;toms was more worth their while than u&s;ual, &s;ell upon that Practice with &s;o much eagerne&s;s, that it was not in the power of the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e Officers at fir&s;t to &s;up|pre&s;s it; At, &s;everal places they practi&s;ed it &s;o openly, and with &s;uch a&s;&s;urance, that when the Officers had made their Seizures they were dri|ven from them by the Rabbles, and the Goods attempted to be taken from them by force, &amp; a Fleet arriving from <HI>Holland</HI> about the Months of <HI>August</HI> or <HI>September</HI> after the Union, it was thought that &s;everal thou&s;and &s;mall Casks of Brandy were conveyed &s;ecretly on Shore, which it was impo&s;&s;ible to prevent: But of this I &s;hall be more particular by and by.</P>
<P>It was time therefore to take new Methods, and the Commi&s;&s;io|ners
<PB N="11" REF="572">
Applying them&s;elves to the Government in this Matter, Soul|diers were appointed to Defend the Collectors, as occa&s;ion &s;hould offer, and the Per&s;ons who had Re&s;i&s;ted, as above, were Seized, and ordered to be pro&s;ecuted; I might give a long Hi&s;tory here, of the Frauds and Violences put upon the Government, in the matters of the Cu&s;toms, by which whole Ships Loadings of Goods were at|tempted to be put on Shore, without paying the Cu&s;tom; But this is enough to make it plain, what Occa&s;ion there was of a &s;trict and exact Management in this Affair, and con&s;equently of a &s;e|parate Commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Cu&s;toms al&s;o in <HI>Scotland,</HI> had been under a Management quite different from that in <HI>England;</HI> the Commi&s;&s;io|ners &s;ound the Trade &s;mall, the Officers few, and Di&s;couraged, their Salaries &s;mall, and the Extent of the Ports va&s;tly large; So that of that &s;mall Bu&s;ine&s;s there was in the Nation, much of it was carried on by the Clande&s;tine Management of the Merchant, and tho' the Farmers or Tack&s;men did their utmo&s;t, with the Officers they had, yet it was impo&s;&s;ible to prevent the Running great Quantities of Goods.</P>
<P>If this was a General Practice before, much more was it &s;o now, when the Sweetne&s;s of it was Ta&s;ted by the Merchants after the Union, when the Duty of Wine and Brandy, was about Five times to Eight times as much as it was before. This added to the Inconveni|encies the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e at fir&s;t laboured under, made it impo&s;&s;ible to put a &s;top to the Irregular Practice of the Merchants, the Firths of <HI>Forth</HI> and <HI>Clyde,</HI> are known to be very large, and the whole Kingdom full of Creiks, Coves, Harbours and Bays, that unle&s;s a little Army of Officers had been maintained, it was not po&s;&s;ible they could ea&s;ily check the running Goods on Shore, where there was &s;o great a Temptation and Opportunity.</P>
<P>But in order to Rectifie this as much as po&s;&s;ible, Riding Officers were appointed to Survey the Coa&s;t, the&s;e were U&s;eful to ob&s;erve the Officers, that they did their Duty, and withal, to Inform the Commi&s;&s;ioners of what happened, to Regulate the Ports, and Di|rect the fixing Officers in proper places.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;i&s;ted of Four general Riding Surveyors, who dividing the whole Kingdom in proper Di&s;tricts, had Twelve Riding Officers under them. Three to each Surveyor, the&s;e were &s;ubject to the Or|ders and In&s;pection of the fir&s;t Four, and all &s;ubject to the General Orders of the Commi&s;&s;ioners them&s;elves, as they found occa&s;ion; Nor did the Commi&s;&s;ioners them&s;elves &s;tick, as they found the Ser|vice required it, to take a per&s;onal In&s;pection into the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Cu&s;tomes at their fir&s;t Planting, frequently making long Jour|neys them&s;elves, to Vi&s;it the Coa&s;t, and Rectifie &s;uch Abu&s;es as they found requi&s;ite, which tho' not u&s;ual, they made no Difficulty to do, at the fir&s;t Settlement of this nice Branch of the Revenue.</P>
<P>Several Crui&s;ing Ve&s;&s;els al&s;o &amp; &s;mall Boats were built, <HI>For the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Officers were intirely without them before,</HI> by which they were
<PB N="12" REF="573">
able to Vi&s;it and Search Ships as they appeared, at any Time, in the Sea, off of the Ports, or in all the Creiks and Rivers as there was occa&s;ion&mdash;; for want of which, it was frequent|ly practi&s;ed, for Ships to appear at a di&s;tance, make Signals for their Confederates, who came off in Boats, and &s;o delivered the Goods they de&s;igned to Run, before they came into Port; The&s;e Boats particularly in the Firth of <HI>Forth,</HI> having the whole Firth to Range in, had their appointed Signals al&s;o on the Shores, where|by they never failed to have Notice, if the Officers appeared, and could &s;hift from Port to Port, or from one &s;ide of the Firth to the other, till they had a clear Port to Land in; and the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Officers might have the Satisfaction to &s;tand on the Shore, and look on, but having no Ve&s;&s;el or Boat to go off in, could not pre|vent the Fraud.</P>
<P>But this was intirely prevented by the Vigilance of the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners, who placed their Crui&s;ing Ve&s;&s;els in proper Stations on the Sea, and their &s;everal &s;maller Boats in the Rivers, Creiks and Ports; and the&s;e concurred together with the Riding Officers and Surveyors on Shore, who, in their con&s;tant Circuits, an&s;wered ex|actly by Land, what the &s;aid Ve&s;&s;els did on the Sea&mdash;; By the Exactne&s;s of this Method, the Affair of the Cu&s;toms pre&s;ently came into Form, and Things looked with a new Face in Trade, to the Satisfaction of Fair Traders, and the better Collecting and &s;ecuring the Duties.</P>
<P>And for the better Explaining the particular Management of the Cu&s;toms in <HI>Scotland</HI> as to this Point, and giving a Proof of what I have Noted as above, I have added a brief Scheme of the &s;everal Stations of the &s;aid Crui&s;ers by Sea, their appointed Bu&s;ine&s;s, and Original Coa&s;ts, together with the Stations of the Riding Officers on Shore, which will be found <HI>Appendix</HI> Part 11. N^o^. (R x x, S x x.) and to which the Reader is referred; a Scheme al&s;o of the Difference of &s;everal Duties before and after the Union, from which the Encouragement for the&s;e Di&s;orders were drawn; The&s;e you will find <HI>Appendix</HI> Part 11. N^o^. (T x x, V x x, X x x.)</P>
<P>I have been the longer on this, as well to give the true Rea&s;ons, why it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to place <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Officers in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> in order to Regulate the Collection, as why it was ab&s;olute|ly nece&s;&s;ary to have a di&s;tinct Commi&s;&s;ion in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and this will always hold to be a Rea&s;on for &s;uch a Method; It being Im|practicable, that all the variety of Ca&s;es which &s;hall happen there, &s;hould be Determined by the Board at <HI>London,</HI> or left to the Arbi|trary Deci&s;ion of &s;ingle Collectors; And this was one Rea&s;on among others, why the Parliament found it nece&s;&s;ary, to have a Court of Exchequer E&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> in which all the Seizures, Confi&s;cations, and Pleas between the Merchant and the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Officers, &s;hould be Determined, &s;ince it would have been an in&s;upportable Grievance, both to the Queen as well as to the Subject; to the fir&s;t, to have had &s;uch Pleas be Determined in the Ordinary Methods of the Law. And to the &s;econd, to have been
<PB N="13" REF="574">
obliged to Defend them&s;elves in <HI>England,</HI> whither Witne&s;&s;es mu&s;t have been &s;ent, and the Defendants have been bound to have ap|peared upon every trifling Occa&s;ion; Of which by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>As the Cu&s;toms were thus nece&s;&s;arily put under a &s;eparate Col|lection, &s;o was the Exci&s;e&mdash;; that Branch of the Revenue was not without its Difficulties, and as there would be every day Nice|ties and Difficulties ari&s;ing, which no Government could Fore&s;ee; So it would have been too great a Neglect of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to have put the Determination of that whole Branch of the Revenue, into the Hands of &s;ingle Collectors.</P>
<P>Again, the Di&s;putes in the Exci&s;e in <HI>England,</HI> being referred wholly to the Ju&s;tices of the Peace, and at the fir&s;t &s;ettling this Duty, there being no Ju&s;tices of the Peace &s;ettled in <HI>Scotland,</HI> it would too much have Expo&s;ed the Subject, to have left them to the Arbitrary Deci&s;ion of Inferiour Collectors, and too much have Expo&s;ed the Government to have left the Queen, without a due Power to have &s;ecured the Revenue.</P>
<P>But there was yet other Rea&s;ons, which made the E&s;tabli&s;hing &s;eparate Commi&s;&s;ions in <HI>Scotland</HI> for the Revenue, as above, to be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and this was the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Articles of the Union, which appointed the Laws of <HI>Scotland</HI> to remain in Force as they were&mdash;; One Con&s;equence of this Ar|ticle, was, That all the Pleas of the Crown, as well as all Matters of private Right, became Cogno&s;cable only in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to be Judged by what was before, or was now to be Deem'd, the Law of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Hence it appeared ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to have Two new Courts Erected in <HI>Scotland,</HI> That is to &s;ay, New in Method, tho' not in Name, <HI>viz.</HI> a Court of Admiralty, and a Court of Exchequer; The fir&s;t to Determine Maritime Di&s;putes, the other, &s;uch as related to the Receipt of the Revenue, as Seizures, Forfeitures Penal|ties, Crown Lands, Lea&s;es, Grants, Patents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and whatever De|mands the Sovereign had upon the Subjects.</P>
<P>It was expre&s;ly &s;tipulated in the Twenty Fourth Article of the U|nion; <HI>That a Seal in</HI> Scotland <HI>after the &V;nion be always kept and made u&s;e of in all things relating to private Rights or Grants, which have u&s;ually pa&s;&s;ed the Great Seal of</HI> Scotland, <HI>and which only concern Offices, Grants, Commi&s;&s;ions, and private Rights within that King|dom; And that, until &s;uch Seal &s;hall be appointed by Her Maje&s;ty, the pre&s;ent Great Seal of</HI> Scotland <HI>&s;hall be u&s;ed for &s;uch Purpo&s;es; And that the Privy Seal, Signet, Ca&s;&s;et, Signet of the Ju&s;ticiary Court, Quarter-Seal, and Seals of Courts now u&s;ed in</HI> Scotland <HI>be continued.</HI></P>
<P>By this Clau&s;e, all Grants, Patents, Commi&s;&s;ions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were ne|ce&s;&s;arily to be pa&s;t in <HI>Scotland</HI>&mdash;; By this Clau&s;e al&s;o it became ne|ce&s;&s;ary, that there &s;hould be a di&s;tinct Keeper of the Seal, and a di&s;tinct Keeper of the Signet in <HI>Scotland,</HI> tho' there was but one Lord Chancellor.</P>
<P>Again, by the Eighteenth Article, it was expre&s;ly &s;tipulated; <HI>That the Laws concerning Regulation of Trade, Cu&s;toms, and &s;uch</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="575">
<HI>Exci&s;es, to which</HI> Scotland <HI>is, by virtue of this Treaty, to be lyable, be the &s;ame in</HI> Scotland, <HI>from and after the &V;nion as in</HI> England; <HI>And that all other Laws, in u&s;e within the Kingdom of</HI> Scotland, <HI>do after the &V;nion, and notwith&s;tanding thereof, remain in the &s;ame Force as before, (except &s;uch as are contrary to, or incon&s;i&s;tent with the Terms of this Treaty) but alterable by the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain, <HI>with this Difference betwixt the Laws concerning Publick Right, Policy, and Civil Government, and tho&s;e which concern private Right; That the Laws which concern publick Right, Policy, and Civil Government, may be made the &s;ame throughout the whole united Kingdom; But that no Alteration be made in Laws which concern private Rights, except for evident &V;tility of the Subjects within</HI> Scotland.</P>
<P>This drove the Treaters to the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of Forming all tho&s;e Particulars of the Nineteenth Article, which are but the Ex|planation of the Eighteenth; <HI>That the Court of Se&s;&s;ion, or Colledge of Justice, do after the &V;nion, and notwith&s;tanding thereof, remain in all time coming within</HI> Scotland <HI>as it is now Con&s;tituted by the Laws of that Kingdom, and with the &s;ame Authority and Privileges as before the &V;nion.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;ettled the Laws of private Right; Then the Court of Ad|miralty comes, as a Con&s;equence of the &s;econd Clau&s;e, as follows; <HI>And that all</HI> Admiralty Juri&s;dictions <HI>be under the Lord High</HI> Admiral <HI>or</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners <HI>for the</HI> Admiralty <HI>of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>for the time be|ing; And that the</HI> Court <HI>of</HI> Admiralty <HI>now Establi&s;hed in</HI> Scotland <HI>be continued, and that all Reviews, Reductions, or Su&s;pen&s;ions, of the Sentences in Maritime Ca&s;es competent to the Juri&s;diction of that</HI> Court, <HI>remain in the &s;ame manner after the</HI> Union, <HI>as now in</HI> Scotland, <HI>until the</HI> Parliament <HI>of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>&s;hall make &s;uch Regulations and Alte|rations, as &s;hall be judged Expedient for the whole &V;nited Kingdom, &s;o as there be always continued in</HI> Scotland <HI>a</HI> Court <HI>of</HI> Admiralty, <HI>&s;uch as is in</HI> England, <HI>for Determination of all Maritime Ca&s;es relating to private Rights in</HI> Scotland, <HI>competent to the Juri&s;diction of the</HI> Admi|ralty Court, <HI>&s;ubject neverthele&s;s to &s;uch Regulations and Alterations, as &s;hall be thought proper to be made by the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain; <HI>And that the Heretable Rights of Admiralty and Vice-Admiralties in</HI> Scotland <HI>be Re&s;erved to the Re&s;pective Proprietors as Rights of Property, &s;ubject neverthele&s;s, as to the manner of Exerci&s;ing &s;uch Heretable Rights.</HI></P>
<P>That all Pleas of Right, whether in private Right or Pleas of the Crown, were Cogni&s;able only in <HI>Scotland,</HI> is proved by the &s;ame Article, in the following words; <HI>And that no Cau&s;es in</HI> Scotland <HI>be Cogno&s;cable by the Courts of</HI> Chancery, Queens-bench, Common-Pleas, <HI>or any other Court in</HI> We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall; <HI>and that the &s;aid Courts, or any other of the like Nature, after the &V;nion, &s;hall have no Power to Cogno&s;ce, Review, or Alter the Acts or Sentences of the Judicatures with|in</HI> Scotland, <HI>or to &s;top the Execution of the &s;ame.</HI></P>
<P>The Exchequer as a further Con&s;equence follows next, in the&s;e words; <HI>And that there be a Court of Exchequer in</HI> Scotland <HI>after the &V;nion, for Deciding Que&s;tions concerning the Revenues of Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;es there, having the &s;ame Power and Authority in &s;uch Ca&s;es, as</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="576">
<HI>the Court of Exchequer has in</HI> England; <HI>And that the &s;aid Court of Exchequer in</HI> Scotland <HI>have Power of pa&s;&s;ing Signatures, Gifts, Tu|tories, and in other Things, as the Court of Exchequer at pre&s;ent in</HI> Scotland <HI>hath; And that the Court of Exchequer that now is in</HI> Scotland <HI>do remain, until a new Court of Exchequer be &s;ettled by the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>in</HI> Scotland <HI>after the Union.</HI></P>
<P>By the&s;e particular E&s;tabli&s;hments may be &s;een not only the manner of the publick Management in <HI>Scotland,</HI> but the Rea&s;on of it, and from whence it became nece&s;&s;ary to have the Court of Exchequer, the Commi&s;&s;ions, and the &s;eparate Collection of the Publick Revenue &s;ettled in <HI>Scotland,</HI> all flowing from this main Original &s;tated in the Treaty, <HI>viz.</HI> That all Cau&s;es between the Queen and the Subject are only cogni&s;able in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>According to this Foundation, the Collections for the Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;es were &s;ettled in <HI>Scotland</HI> in di&s;tinct Commi&s;&s;ions, as has been &s;aid, and tho' at fir&s;t the Difficulties in the &s;aid Collections ap|peared great, and &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s on every &s;ide began to ri&s;e, yet as they principally lay on the backwardne&s;s of the Subject to come under a &s;trict Survey as to the Duties, Time wore off the&s;e Things, and the People became more &s;en&s;ible of the Nece&s;&s;ity of the exact Collection, in order to bring Trade to an Equality.</P>
<P>At the beginning, the People thought every Seizure of prohibited Goods a Violence upon their Properties, and clamoured at the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> and the &V;nion; as if the Union had been made not to bring them under good Government, but to leave them without Govern|ment. &V;pon this Notion they fell to running of Brandy in particu|lar at that prodigious Rate, that &s;ome thou&s;ands of &s;mall Casks of Brandy was in &s;pight of all the Vigilance of Officers &s;ecretly &s;uppo&s;ed to be put on Shore out of the fir&s;t <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet that came to <HI>Scot|land</HI> after the Union; and when the Officers made Seizure of &s;everal Parcels, the Rabbles by Violence re&s;cued them again, as is already noted above.</P>
<P>But this Practice was ea&s;ily &s;uppre&s;t, for not the Government only, but all the fair Merchants were concerned in it, &s;ince the running of Goods on Shore, without paying Cu&s;tom, is a known prejudice to the Merchant, who entring his Goods fairly, and paying large Cu&s;toms, is by the&s;e People under-&s;old, and the Market fore&s;tal'd; The&s;e things therefore began to meet with le&s;s Encouragement, and having no Countenance but from the meer Rabble, the frequent Lo&s;&s;es they met with, by the activity of the Officers of the Cu&s;toms by little and litle, di&s;couraged the Adventurers, and Trade began to run in it's proper Channel.</P>
<P>The Difficulties of the Exci&s;e were of another kind; Of which by them&s;elves; And tho' the Rules of the Collecting the Exci&s;e, &amp; the Methods of charging the Subject were very exact and regular, yet they were not without great Ob&s;tructions in their Work, as has been noted. The fir&s;t by rea&s;on of a Mi&s;under&s;tanding of the Sen&s;e of the Article in the &V;nion, &s;ettling the Duty of Exci&s;e, which having ex|pre&s;t the &s;everal Mea&s;ures, not very exactly, admitted a double Con|&s;truction as to the Quantity what was to be e&s;teemed the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="577">
Barrel: The Commi&s;&s;ioners had charged it one way, and the Brewers demanded it another, as follows.</P>
<P>The Act expre&s;&s;es it thus.<Q>VII. That all the parts of the united Kingdom be for ever and after the Union, Liable to the &s;ame Exci&s;es upon all exci&s;eable liquors, excepting only that the thirty four Gallons <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to the Barrel of Beer or Ale, amounting to Twelve Gallons <HI>Scots</HI> pre&s;ent mea&s;ure, &s;old in <HI>Scot|land</HI> by the Brewer at nine &s;hilling &s;ix pence <HI>Sterling</HI> excluding all Du|ties, and retailed including Duties on the Retailers profit, at two pence the <HI>Scots</HI> Pint, or eight part of the <HI>Scots</HI> Gallon, be not after the Union lyable on account of the pre&s;ent Exci&s;e upon Exci&s;eable Liquors in <HI>England,</HI> to any higher Impo&s;ition than two &s;hillings <HI>Sterling</HI> upon the fore&s;aid thirty four Gallons <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mea&s;ure being twelve Gallons the pre&s;ent <HI>Scots</HI> Mea&s;ure, and that the Exci&s;e &s;ettled in <HI>England</HI> on all other Liquors when the Union Commences, take place throughout the whole united Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>When the Exci&s;e Office came to Charge the Brewer upon this Cau&s;e, they could reckon it no otherwi&s;e than as in <HI>England,</HI> by the Gauge of Thirty Four Gallons <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to the Barrel; And thus the Brewer &s;tood Charged for &s;ome Time.</P>
<P>But the Brewers objected, and &s;ticking to the Letter of the Article demanded, to pay but 2 <HI>&s;h.</HI> for 12 <HI>Scots</HI> Gallons, whether it over-run the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> 34 Gallons or no.</P>
<P>This occa&s;ioned &s;ome &s;mall Debate, but the Prudence of the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners prevented the Clamour &s;ome People would willingly have rai&s;ed upon it, and the Ju&s;tices of Peace directing 1/17. in each Thirty Four Gallons to be allowed, the Brewer for the pre&s;ent left it Undetermined till the Parliament &s;hould &s;ettle it; And thus the Brewers were made Ea&s;ie; It is to be ob|&s;erved, to the Honour of the per&s;ons employed in the fir&s;t Settle|ment of the Exci&s;e in <HI>Scotland;</HI> That con&s;idering the Ignorance of the mo&s;t part of their Officers in the Art of Gauging, and in the new Methods of taking the Worts, and making a Charge, con&s;ide|ring the Difficulty of &s;atisfying and convincing the People who were to pay the Duty, that they had no wrong done them, they them|&s;elves being unable to examine the Gaugers Accounts, no Duty was ever &s;ettled with &s;o little Noi&s;e, or with &s;o few Complaints, not one per&s;on that ever I could hear of having any Appeal from the Commi&s;&s;ioners Sentences, or making any Complaint of Inju&s;tice done them; But the Collection went on ea&s;ie, was collected quietly, paid cheerfully, and vi&s;ibly improved the Revenue, tho' nothing was paid by the Brewer more than they paid before.</P>
<P>Nor had it been po&s;&s;ible to collect this Duty legally, if it had not been &s;o, for the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Exci&s;e laboured under another Difficulty which none of the other Branches of the Revenue were troubled with, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Laws of Collection being by the &V;nion to be the &s;ame as in <HI>England,</HI> and the Ju&s;tices of the Peace being by the Act of Parliament 12. <HI>Carol.</HI> II. in <HI>England</HI> made Judges between the Queen and the Subject, in ca&s;es of Di&s;pute; from

<P>There was indeed a Nomination of Ju&s;tices by the Privy Council of <HI>Scotland</HI> 15 <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1707, as will appear in its place, and for &s;ome few Months they did meet and Act; But this was a new Set|tlement, and the Centlemen named were yet young in their Bu&s;ine&s;s, little help could be had from them, and which was &s;till wor&s;e be|fore they had time to inform them&s;elves, their Power died by the Act of Paliament in <HI>England,</HI> di&s;&s;olving the Privy Council in <HI>Scotland.</HI> This Act pa&s;t in the beginning of the fir&s;t <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, and by the Cea&s;ing of that Power, from whence tho&s;e Ju&s;tices derived, the Power of the Ju&s;tices al&s;o Cea&s;ed; and they were now to receive new Commi&s;&s;ions from the Lord Chancellor of <HI>Britain,</HI> as the Ju&s;tices in <HI>England</HI> al&s;o did&mdash;; This was not Fini&s;hed till <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1708; &s;o that in all that Time, the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Exci&s;e had no legal Authority before whom they could Convict any Offender, or puni&s;h any Breach of the Law, or by whom any Ca&s;e could be Determined.</P>

<P>The Exci&s;e as well as Cu&s;toms in <HI>Scotland</HI> had been Farmed out; or Let in Tack, <HI>as they call it,</HI> the Tack&s;men or Farmers did their be&s;t&mdash;, for their own Intere&s;t; But &s;everal Circum&s;tances rendred their Method of Collecting the Exci&s;e, unfit to be Imitated, &s;uch as their Officers, <HI>who were intirely ignorant of the Art of Gauging,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">a|king the lengths of the Worts by Gue&s;s, &amp; proving Quantities chiefly by the Oaths of the Brewers and the like, which joyned with &s;ome other Practices, I care not to mention, expo&s;ed both the Collectors and the Brewers to &s;everal Inconveniencies, and in General, made the Charge on the Brewer many ways Unequal&mdash;; a Thing prejudicial not to the Duty only, but to the Fair Dealer particular|ly, who always &s;uffers by the Frauds and Connivances of others.</P>
<P>On this account when the fir&s;t of <HI>May</HI> came, &amp; the Union taking place, the new Duty was to begin, the Government found them&s;elves ne|ce&s;&s;itated to &s;end down a great many Officers into <HI>Scotland,</HI> if po&s;&s;ible, to put Things into &s;ome Order, and prepare the People for the new Method of Collection&mdash;; What Treatment the&s;e Officers received in <HI>Scotland,</HI> how ill the People there u&s;ed them, and how little they were able to do, will be&s;t appear by this, That the Government found them&s;elves obliged by Proclamation, to let the Duty go on for &s;ome Time in the &s;ame Methods, and Collected by the &s;ame Officers, till the new Methods could be prepared.</P>
<P>Nor was this all, for tho' the new Commi&s;&s;ion was formed as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, for the Commi&s;&s;ioners began to Act on the 9<HI>th</HI> of
<PB N="18" REF="579">
<HI>June,</HI> yet they had the whole Kingdom to Regulate as to the Col|lection, all their Officers to In&s;truct, both as to Method and to Act; The fir&s;t relating to the Accounts, and the la&s;t as to Gauging, not an Officer in the whole Kingdom, under&s;tanding the u&s;e of the Gauging Rod, as is Noted already, nor the People knowing the Meaning of it.</P>
<P>This makes the Difficulty of Settling the Exci&s;e in <HI>Scotland</HI> ap|pear, and indeed who ever con&s;iders the manner of Collection be|fore the Union, as before; will Wonder, how it was po&s;&s;ible ever to bring the Bu&s;ine&s;s into any Order, for the People being mo&s;t intolerably Aver&s;e at fir&s;t, to the new Regulations, rai&s;ed innume|rable Clamours at the Officers that came from <HI>England,</HI> as Impo&s;ing Novelties on them, and confounding their Bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;; And here, as well as in the Cu&s;toms, the Clamour again&s;t <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> being imployed, was laid hold of, but the Conduct of the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners here likewi&s;e effectually An&s;wered that Pretence, for no &s;ooner had the Officers, &s;ent by the Commi&s;&s;ioners in <HI>England,</HI> as above, done the Work they came about, <HI>viz.</HI> in Directing and In&s;tructing the Officers in <HI>Scotland,</HI> but the greate&s;t part of them were &s;ent back again, and &s;o few <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> remained in the Exci&s;e, that it is not worth Naming.</P>

<P>Nor was the Duty of Exci&s;e as a Revenue without its Di&s;courage|ments, <HI>as well as the Cu&s;toms,</HI> the Article of Private Rights, re&s;erved by the Union, had of cour&s;e brought &s;everal Exemptions upon them, &s;ome of which have proved very con&s;iderable Hindrances to the Duty.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners however, Di&s;puted with &s;ome of tho&s;e People who claim'd Exemptions of Duty, and the Debate on tho&s;e Heads, lay Undetermined before the Barons of Exchequer, at the Writing the&s;e Sheets.</P>
<P>Under all the&s;e Di&s;couragements, yet the Collection went on, and the Brewers &s;oon became Satisfied with the manner of Charging the Exci&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> by Gauging, as the mo&s;t Equal, Indifferent, and Un|deniably certain; and, as a method no Man could be Wronged by&mdash;; Which giving them all an Equality with one another; was very much the Advantage of the Fair Traders&mdash;, who always Suffer by the Frauds of Clande&s;tine Dealing.</P>
<P>Nay, this was evident by the Brewers them&s;elves, who differing with the City of <HI>Edinburghs</HI> A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, about the Taxes paid to the

City, endeavoured to have the City Officers, Charge them by the Gauging Rod, as in the Exci&s;e, but could not obtain it.</P>
<P>I have in&s;i&s;ted upon the Difficulties of &s;ettling the&s;e Things, to &s;how the World the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity, of placing the Collection of the Revenue in <HI>Scotland,</HI> di&s;tinct from that in <HI>England;</HI> And al&s;o, as a Thing needful, to &s;how by what Steps the &s;everal Offices ar|rived to that Order and Exactne&s;s, which they now appeared to be Managed in.</P>
<P>I come now to the Affair of the Equivalent.</P>
<P>The Calculations and Proportions between the Nations, <HI>being the Ground from whence it became payable to Scotland;</HI> I have gone thro' already, as di&s;tinctly as I can, in the &s;everal Ob&s;ervations on the Minutes of the Treaty, fir&s;t at <HI>London,</HI> and after, in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland;</HI> We are now come to the payment of it.</P>
<P>The Parliament had Determined, both how it &s;hould be Di&s;|po&s;ed of, and who &s;hould Di&s;po&s;e it, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Queen &s;hould Name Commi&s;&s;ioners to Receive and I&s;&s;ue out the &s;aid Money, according to the Terms of the Union; This you have expre&s;ly in the Fifteenth Article of the Union, as concluded at <HI>London,</HI> as follows; <HI>And it is agreed, That Her Maje&s;ty be Impowered to appoint Commi&s;&s;ioners, who &s;hall be accountable to the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain, <HI>for di&s;po&s;ing the &s;aid Summe of three hundred, ninety eight thou&s;and, eighty five Pounds, ten Shillings, and all other Moneys which &s;hall ari&s;e to</HI> Scotland, <HI>upon the Agreements afore&s;aid, to the purpo&s;es before-mentioned: Which Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall be Impowered to call for, Receive, and Di&s;po&s;e of the &s;aid Moneys in manner afore&s;aid, and to in&s;pect the Books of the &s;everal Collectors of the &s;aid Revenues, and of all other Duties, from whence an Equivalent may ari&s;e; And that the Collectors and Managers of the &s;aid Revenues and Duties be obliged to give to the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;ub&s;cribed Authentick Abbreviates of the Produce of &s;uch Revenues and Duties ari&s;ing in their re&s;pective Di&s;tricts; And that the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall have their Office within the Limits of</HI> Scotland, <HI>and &s;hall, in &s;uch Office, keep Books containing Accounts of the Amount of the Equivalents, and how the &s;ame &s;hall have been di&s;po&s;ed of from time to time, which may be in&s;pected by any of the Sub|jects who &s;hall de&s;ire the &s;amen.</HI></P>

<P>The Four Merchants of <HI>London</HI> were Named, becau&s;e as Members of the Bank of <HI>England,</HI> they were required to be pre|&s;ent upon the Spot, in order to &s;upport the Credit of the Bank, in ca&s;e any Body had &s;crupled their Bills; And indeed there was Oc|ca&s;ion &s;ufficient for their being there, as will appear pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>It was now the beginning of <HI>July,</HI> and the Money was not yet come away from <HI>London;</HI> It would be Endle&s;s to Record here, the Scandalous Reflections &s;pread about, of the Delay of Payment, and how the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> having &s;ecured the main Point, would pay the Money when they plea&s;ed, or perhaps never; and &s;ome ran it up to that Height, as to &s;ay, That the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> De&s;igned to Cheat them of the Money.</P>
<P>Again, another &s;ort of People pretended the Union was broke, becau&s;e the Money was not paid by the fir&s;t of <HI>May,</HI> and there was a Di&s;cour&s;e of &s;ome Gentlemen, who came up to the Cro&s;s of <HI>Edin|burgh,</HI> and Prote&s;ted in the Name of the whole <HI>Scots</HI> Nation, That the Conditions of the Treaty being not complyed with, and the
<PB N="21" REF="582">
Terms performed, the whole was Void, and <HI>Scotland</HI> was again Free, when ever an Occa&s;ion offered, to lay hold of that Freedom&mdash;; That &s;ome People were &s;o weak to Talk thus, and that a certain Gentleman was Fooli&s;h enough, to make &s;uch a Formal Prote&s;tation, I have &s;ome Rea&s;on to believe; But that D&mdash; <HI>H&mdash;</HI> was the Man, I profe&s;s not to know, and believe, that Noble Per&s;on to under&s;tand the Nature of the Treaty, and the Nature of Prote&s;t|ing al&s;o, better than &s;o.</P>
<P>Be it as it will, &s;uch Prote&s;tation was of no u&s;e, neither could it have any Signification, being made purely without Ground, the Treaty having no where Tyed up the Government of <HI>England,</HI> to have the Money actually in <HI>Scotland</HI> by &s;uch a Day&mdash;; Nor was <HI>England</HI> by the Treaty, under any Obligation to a Day of Payment; But Two Things pre&s;cribed the payment, and a Third clears it all mo&s;t effectually.</P>
<P N="1">1. That by the Cu&s;tom of <HI>England,</HI> any payment Contracted for, <HI>&s;ine Die,</HI> becomes a <HI>Debt Demander,</HI> or payable at Demand; and &s;o the Day being not prefixt in the Articles, the Money became pre|&s;ently due, <HI>viz.</HI> the fir&s;t of <HI>May,</HI> but under no Forfeiture on delay of Days, much le&s;s a Di&s;&s;olution of Articles.</P>
<P N="2">2. But if this Nicety had been in&s;i&s;ted on, then it is An&s;wered, That the Money was actually payed by <HI>England,</HI> being delivered by the Trea&s;ury to a certain Number of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, appointed for receiving the Equivalent, and this, either upon or before the fir&s;t of <HI>May;</HI> And tho' it was not actually come down into <HI>Scotland,</HI> yet if it was delivered in <HI>London,</HI> to the proper Per&s;ons appointed to receive it, the Government of <HI>England</HI> was fairly acquitted of the payment&mdash;; And this is to be &s;een by the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners Receipt in the Exchequer in <HI>England,</HI> when the Money was paid.</P>
<P N="3">3. But a third Clau&s;e &s;hewed all this to be an In&s;ignificant and a mo&s;t Ignorant Pretence, for the Equivalent was actually paid, and made good to <HI>Scotland,</HI> before the Treaty was concluded, and it was expre&s;ly &s;tipulated &s;o to be Ordered, in the Fifteenth Article, in the&s;e words; <HI>It is agreed, that</HI> Scotland <HI>&s;hall have an Equivalent for what the Subjects thereof &s;hall be &s;o charged towards payment of the &s;aid Debts of</HI> England, <HI>in all particulars what&s;oever, in manner fol|lowing,</HI> viz. <HI>That before the &V;nion of the &s;aid Kingdoms, the Summe of three hundred, ninety eight thou&s;and and eighty five pound ten &s;hil|lings be granted to Her Maje&s;ty by the Parliament of</HI> England, <HI>for the &V;&s;es after-mentioned, being the Equivalent, to be an&s;wered to</HI> Scotland <HI>for &s;uch parts of the &s;aid Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;es upon all Exci&s;eable Li|quors, with which that Kingdom is to be charged upon the &V;nion, as will be applicable to the payment of the &s;aid Debts of</HI> England, <HI>accord|ing to the Proportions which the pre&s;ent Cu&s;toms in</HI> Scotland, <HI>being Thirty thou&s;and Pounds</HI> per Annum, <HI>do bear to the Cu&s;toms in</HI> Eng|land, <HI>computed at one Million, three hundred, forty one thou&s;and, five hundred and fifty nine Pounds</HI> per Annum: <HI>And which the pre&s;ent Ex|ci&s;es on Exci&s;eable Liquors in</HI> Scotland, <HI>being thirty three thou&s;and and</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="583">
<HI>five hundred Pounds</HI> per Annum, <HI>do bear to the Exci&s;es on Exci&s;eable Liquors in</HI> England, <HI>computed at nine hundred, forty &s;even thou&s;and, &s;ix hundred and two Pounds</HI> per Annum; <HI>Which Summe of three hundred, ninety eight thou&s;and, eighty five Pounds, ten Shillings, &s;hall be due and payable from the time of the &V;nion;</HI></P>
<P>It is evident from this Article, That the Security Demanded by <HI>Scotland,</HI> for the payment of this Money, was, <HI>That the Parliament of</HI> England <HI>&s;hould rai&s;e the Sum agreed, and &s;hould grant it to Her Ma|je&s;ty, for the &V;&s;es in that Fifteenth Article Expre&s;&s;ed,</HI> That is in &s;hort, <HI>That the Parliament &s;hould grant to Her Maje&s;ty &s;uch a Sum of Money, and appropriate it to the payment of the Equivalent</HI>&mdash;; This really was payment, and was &s;o Accepted, and the Money being Granted to the Queen, was nothing but as a Depo&s;ite in a Third Hand, till the Ratification of the Treaty &s;hould pa&s;s in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and be Confirmed in <HI>England,</HI> or till the Union &s;hould take place, WHEN, AND AS SOON AS that was done, the Money was actually the Right, the proper Goods of the <HI>Scots,</HI> and the Go|vernment of <HI>England</HI> could not have kept it back, no tho' the Treaty had been <HI>afterward</HI> Di&s;&s;olved, or broken; So that the Ob|jection again&s;t the payment of the Equivalent, <HI>in Time,</HI> Dyes, and falls to the Ground, in this, That it was actually payed by <HI>England</HI> before the Union began, and plac'd in &s;uch Hands as a Tru&s;t, to be at the Demand of the <HI>Scots,</HI> as &s;oon as the Union took place, <HI>Due and payable from the Time of the &V;nion,</HI> are the Words of the Article&mdash;; As &s;oon therefore as the Union took place, the Trea&s;ury of <HI>England</HI> became Debitor to <HI>Scotland,</HI> for &s;uch a Sum of Money&mdash;; But the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> with whom the Treaty was made, were Di&s;charged of the Payment, as &s;oon as ever the Act of Appropriation was pa&s;t in the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This, I think, is clear, and admits of no Di&s;pute, but it &s;hows the Weakne&s;s of tho&s;e People, that promi&s;ed them&s;elves any thing from the delay of the Money coming into <HI>Scotland</HI>&mdash;; Nor did their Error cea&s;e here, for when the Money came, they were not at all better plea&s;ed, but rai&s;ed new Clamours at the Union&mdash;, and really went to that Height in their Reproaches, that it &s;eemed as if they had yet latent Expectations of rai&s;ing a new Tumult.</P>
<P>It was indeed &s;omething remarkable here, and not a few People took notice of it, That the very &s;ame People, who ju&s;t before Ex|claimed at the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> for not paying the Money, and cried out they were Cheated, and the Union broken, were the &s;ame&mdash;, who, when the Money came, made as much Noi&s;e on the other hand of being Bought and Sold, &amp; that Money being the Price of their Countrey.</P>
<P>The Violence of this Temper appearing &s;o openly, I can not be counted partial in giving a true Account of it, &s;ince I could not be Faithful to the Matters of Fact, if I Omitted it.</P>
<P>On the Day of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the Money came to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> in Twelve Waggons, Guarded by a Party of <HI>Scots</HI> Dragoons, and was carried directly to the Ca&s;tle; If I omit to enter into the De|tail
<PB N="23" REF="584">
of the Reproaches and Railings at the poor Innocent People that brought it, nay, at the very Hor&s;es that drew the Carriages, it is, becau&s;e it was a Folly below Reproof, and rather de&s;erves Pity.</P>
<P>If I omit Naming a known Per&s;on, in no concealed Station, who was for having the Dragoons that Guarded it, Hanged for bring|ing it in&mdash;; And being asked, What he would have the poor Men do with it? An&s;wered, They &s;hould have cut all them that brought it to pieces, and kept the Money from coming into the Countrey: If I omit Naming this Gentleman, it is in re&s;pect to his Character, and in hopes he may live to be Wi&s;er, and to acknow|ledge his incon&s;iderate Ra&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Waggons, as is Noted, were driven directly to the Ca&s;tle, and the Money Lodged there, to be i&s;&s;ued in its Cour&s;e&mdash;; The People &s;et on by proper Engines, &s;hewed their Di&s;&s;atisfaction at fir&s;t, by rudely Stoning the poor Carters and Drivers, and Two or Three were very much hurt by Stones, as they came back with their Hor&s;es from the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>But this was but the Remains of the Tumultuous Temper, we have been taking Notice of before, and the poor Ignorant People Acting only from outward appearances, without Con&s;ideration&mdash;, grew Calm again of cour&s;e&mdash;; Nor among the mo&s;t Malecontent per&s;ons could I ever find any, that when the Money upon the <HI>Afri|can</HI> Stock came to be paid, would think the <HI>Species</HI> Unhallowed, enough to refu&s;e their &s;hare of it.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Money was Arrived, the Commi&s;&s;ioners for the Equivalent began to Sit, and immediately applyed them&s;elves to the Di&s;tribution of it according to the Terms of the Treaty&mdash;; And having &s;et a parta due Proportion for the Expence of the Coinage, they went immediately to Work with the <HI>African</HI> Stock, and began to pay off.</P>
<P>Yet I mu&s;t not Omit a Difficulty here, that had almo&s;t put the Affair to a full &s;top for a while&mdash;, and this was from the <HI>Species</HI> of the Money they had brought; The Ca&s;e was as follows.</P>
<P>The Bank of <HI>England</HI> had that year, upon an Advance of a Sum of Money to the Government, received 1200000 <HI>libs.</HI> or there abouts, in Exchequer Bills&mdash;, which being made Current by the Credit, both of the Government in publick, and after by the Bank in particular, they pre&s;umed would pa&s;s in payment, as common paper Credit u&s;ually did in <HI>London,</HI> without Intere&s;t, being always payable at demand by the Bank in <HI>London,</HI> this they expected &s;hould go down without any Difficulty in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>But the Bank &s;eemed under &s;ome Mi&s;take as to the Extent of their Reputation, or at lea&s;t as to the Circum&s;tances of <HI>Scotland,</HI> when they propo&s;ed the putting off the&s;e Exchequer Bills there.</P>
<P>However, they ventur'd, and &s;ending only 100000 <HI>lib:</HI> in ready Money, in the Waggons mentioned before, the other 298085 <HI>lib.</HI> 10 <HI>&s;hillings</HI>&mdash;, was &s;ent down in this Paper Credit or Exchequer Bills.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="585">
This rai&s;ed a new Clamour in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and abundance of People run away with it, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trick'd them; that they had &s;ent them Paper in &s;tead of Money, that the great Argument formerly u&s;ed to per&s;wade <HI>Scotland</HI> to the Union, to take upon them a &s;hare of the Burden of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Debts, and to accept of an Equivalent, was the great Advantage that &s;hould accrue to <HI>Scotland,</HI> by the Circulating of &s;o much ready Money in the Nation&mdash;; And that now they were to be put off with Bills payable 300 Miles off, and which if Lo&s;tor Mi&s;laid, or by Accident Burnt, were Irrecoverable.</P>
<P>The Truth is, The Bank of <HI>England</HI> took a wrong &s;tep here&mdash;; For <HI>First,</HI> They ventured upon <HI>Scotland</HI> with their Bills in &s;tead of Money, without Con&s;ulting either the Temper or the Circum&s;tances of <HI>Scotland</HI> at that Time.</P>
<P>Had they Corre&s;ponded with the Bank of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and obtained of the &s;aid Bank to Circulate their Bills, either by their own Credit or Ca&s;h, had they E&s;tabli&s;hed any running Ca&s;h in <HI>Scotland</HI> for the Circulation, where they &s;hould have been Received and I&s;&s;ued on Occa&s;ion, they had come off better&mdash;; Or had the Bills had running Intere&s;t upon them, that tho&s;e People who laid them up, might have had an Increa&s;e upon them as they lay by, there had been &s;ome Rea&s;on to expect they might have pa&s;t.</P>
<P>But the Bank had Ingro&s;&s;ed the Intere&s;t paid on the Bills by the Government, and then &s;ent them Naked into the World, to Run purely on the Credit of their Fund, without any Intere&s;t running upon them. This, and con&s;idering <HI>Scotland,</HI> a Place not yet of a great in land Commerce, in which alone &s;uch Bills are capable of being made Current, made it very improbable, that their Bills &s;hould pa&s;s in <HI>Scotland;</HI> This Mi&s;take the Commi&s;&s;ioners them|&s;elves &s;aw, as &s;oon as they came to <HI>Scotland</HI>&mdash;; And therefore immediately &s;ent away to <HI>England</HI> for 50000 <HI>lib. &s;terling</HI> more in Gold&mdash;; Nor had this been able to have carried them thorow the Payment, had not the Commi&s;&s;ioners, very prudently taken all the Exchequer Bills that any One brought them, and given Bills of Exchange for them payable in <HI>London</HI>&mdash;.</P>
<P>When the Commi&s;&s;ioners found how it was&mdash;, they &s;aw no Remedy, but to Declare, That tho' they had brought Exchequer Bills down, in order to &s;upply the deficiency of Bullion, which was then &s;carce enough in <HI>England,</HI> yet that no body &s;hould be obliged to take them without their Con&s;ent, nor &s;hould any body be re|fu&s;ed payment as they came in their Order; And as a certain Great Per&s;on began with them, as &s;ome thought, by way of Experiment, and having a Demand for 4 or 5000 <HI>lib.</HI> upon the <HI>African</HI> Stock, re|fu&s;ed to take any of the &s;aid Bills, the Commi&s;&s;ioners immediately Ordered it all to be paid in <HI>Specie.</HI></P>
<P>This, and a con&s;tant Currency of Payment, began to rai&s;e them &s;ome Reputation, and &s;ome who were Friends to the Government, and &s;aw the Exigence of the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, accepted of Exchequer Bills for large Sums: Others would take half Money, half Bills&mdash;;
<PB N="25" REF="586">
And others that came for their Money before their Turn came, yet had it offered them if they would take Bills, &s;till pre&s;erving this Point Sacred, that no body was refu&s;ed his payment in cour&s;e, in Money, if he in&s;i&s;ted on it; Thus, with a great deal of Difficulty, at la&s;t they work'd thorow the payment of the <HI>African</HI> Stock&mdash;; The Bills went all away to <HI>England</HI> &s;o directly, that in &s;ix Months time there was not one to be &s;een.</P>
<P>So the Main End of the Bank, <HI>viz.</HI> The Circulation of the&s;e Bills in Trade, as a paper Credit, was quite Lo&s;t, which, had the In|tere&s;t been runing upon them, would have been ea&s;ie, and readily complyed with.</P>
<P>However, it was at la&s;t contrary to Expectation, concluded, and the whole <HI>African</HI> Stock being paid off, that Company Di&s;&s;ol|ved and Died.</P>
<P>The next Affair was the Settlement of Ju&s;tice in <HI>Scotland</HI>&mdash;; And this &s;uffering &s;ome Alteration, it is needful to give a true Account of it according to my Title.</P>
<P>It had been &s;tipulated by the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Articles, <HI>That all other Laws, in u&s;e within the Kingdom of</HI> Scotland, <HI>do after the &V;nion, and notwith&s;tanding thereof, remain in the &s;ame Force as before (except &s;uch as are contrary to, or incon&s;i&s;tent with the Terms of this Treaty) but alterable by the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain, <HI>with this Difference betwixt the Laws concerning Publick Right, Policy, and Civil Government, and tho&s;e which concern private Right; That the Laws which concern publick Right, Policy, and Civil Government, may be made the &s;ame throughout the whole &V;nited Kingdom; But that no Alteration be made in Laws which concern private Right, except for evident &V;tility of the Subjects within</HI> Scotland.</P>
<P><HI>That the Court of Se&s;&s;ion, or Colledge of Ju&s;tice, do after the &V;nion, and notwith&s;tanding thereof, remain in all time coming within</HI> Scotland, <HI>as it is now Con&s;tituted by the Laws of that Kingdom, and with the &s;ame Authority and Privileges as before the &V;nion, &s;ubject neverthele&s;s to &s;uch Regulations for the better Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice, as &s;hall be made by the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain; <HI>And that the Court of Ju|sticiary do al&s;o after the &V;nion, and notwith&s;tanding thereof, remain in all time coming within</HI> Scotland, <HI>as it is now Constituted by the Laws of that Kingdom, and with the &s;ame Authority and Privileges as be|fore the &V;nion, &s;ubject neverthele&s;s to &s;uch Regulations as &s;hall be made by the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain, <HI>and without prejudice of other Rights of Ju&s;ticiary.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Clau&s;es pre&s;erved the ordinary Proce&s;s of Law in Ca&s;e of private Right, in the &s;ame Cour&s;e and Condition as before; but all Pleas of the Crown, Matters of Di&s;pute between the Queen and the Subject, <HI>relating to the Revenue,</HI> and Trade, being to be the &s;ame as in <HI>England;</HI> For that Rea&s;on; there were nece&s;&s;ary Alterati|ons to be made in the Methods, and even new Models of Proceed|ings to be Formed, &s;pecial to <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="587">
And Fir&s;t of the Civil Peace.</P>
<P>The &s;everal Branches of the Revenue, depending much upon the Execution of petty Ju&s;tice, and particularly the Exci&s;e, in which the Ju&s;tices of Peace are in mo&s;t Ca&s;es, the Judges between the Brewer and the Collector; In this ca&s;e, it was Nece&s;&s;ary to Renew the Model formerly u&s;ed, and taken from <HI>England, viz.</HI> Of Ju&s;tices, Con&s;tables, Headboroughs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And this not only for the Deciding Diffe|rences in the Duties, but in Forcible Entries, Executing Warrants, Apprehending Offenders, and the like; In which Ca&s;es Con&s;tables and other Officers are nece&s;&s;ary, both to pre&s;erve the Peace, to A&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;earching Hou&s;es, and in Executing the re&s;pective Warrants of the &s;aid Ju&s;tices of the Peace.</P>
<P>This, I &s;ay, made it ab&s;olutely Nece&s;&s;ary, to E&s;tabli&s;h the &s;ame Method of Civil Ju&s;tice in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as in <HI>England, viz.</HI> by Ju&s;tices of the Peace, Con&s;tables, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Which at that Time was not in u&s;e in the whole Countrey.</P>
<P>It had indeed been formerly attempted in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and there were &s;ome Acts of Parliament then in Force, for the making Ju&s;tices of the Peace in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as in <HI>England,</HI> particularly the 12<HI>th. Act</HI> of the fir&s;t <HI>Parl. Carol.</HI> 2. <HI>anno</HI> 1661, and again by the 38<HI>th. Act</HI> of the &s;ame Parliament&mdash;; And the&s;e Acts are Recited again in the Proclamation for Erecting new Ju&s;tices at this Time, which Proclamation leaving out the Names of the Per&s;ons as &V;&s;ele&s;s and Tedious, I have annexed in the <HI>Appendix</HI> N^o F (3).</P>
<P>Upon the <HI>Revolution,</HI> this Method of Governing by Ju&s;tices, however u&s;eful in its kind, yet as having been Negligently or Ar|bitrarily made u&s;e of in the former Times, was laid a&s;ide, and the Government of <HI>Scotland</HI> lay as it had u&s;ually done, too much in the ab&s;olute Di&s;po&s;ition of the Heretable Magi&s;trates, &s;uch as Sheriffs of Counties, Steuarts of Stewartries, and &s;uch Right as the Superiori|ties and U&s;ages of Places gave to the Lairds; A Con&s;titution not at all Calculated for the Liberty of <HI>Scotland,</HI> or the increa&s;e of the Happine&s;s of the People.</P>
<P>Upon the Settling the Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;e, as above, it be|came, I &s;ay, nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;tore the former Model of petty Ju&s;tice, as <HI>per</HI> the Proclamation before Named, was done at this Time, and accordingly Ju&s;tices of the Peace and Con&s;tables were Erected all over <HI>Scotland</HI>&mdash;; But this received another Interruption as a Con&s;equence of the Union, which put a &s;top to all the Civil Admini&s;tration for a Time, as follows.</P>
<P>By the Nineteenth Article of the Union, the Affair of the Privy Council in <HI>Scotland</HI> was left thus.<Q>And that after the &V;nion, the Queens Maje&s;ty and Her Royal Succe&s;&s;ors, may continue a Privy Council in <HI>Scotland,</HI> for pre&s;erving of publick Peace and Order, until the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> &s;hall think fit to alter it, or E&s;tabli&s;h any other effectual Method for that end.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="588">
As &s;oon as the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> met, and began to Enquire into the Matter, they found the very Nature of a Privy Council in <HI>Scotland,</HI> but e&s;pecially the Manner, <HI>of their Privy Coun|cils,</HI> &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with the Treaty of Union, and above all, with the Liberty of the Subject, that they effectually Di&s;&s;olved it, and Voted, that there &s;hould be but one Privy Council in <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>I know this Act was oppo&s;ed by &s;everal &s;orts of People&mdash;, and Complaint was made after its Di&s;&s;olution, That <HI>Scotland</HI> was left without any Form of Government; &s;ome others Complained from another principle, of which I need &s;ay nothing here.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;ters of State al&s;o oppo&s;ed it a little, but no further, than as they thought Things were not Ripe in <HI>Scotland,</HI> for &s;o &s;ud|den a Di&s;&s;olution of the Face of Power among them, and therefore would have had it continued for &s;ome certain limited Time only, and that with &s;uch Limitations of Authority, as might be Regulated by Parliament&mdash;; But it was thought both Burden&s;ome and Dangerous, and indeed the Council in <HI>Scotland</HI> Acting Arbitrarily, had given the Lovers of Liberty &s;uch an Aver&s;ion to them, that they could not hear of it; And &s;o after &s;ome Struggle, the Coun|cil was Di&s;&s;olved by Act of Parliament.</P>
<P>This is mentioned here, becau&s;e of the Interruption given by the Accident of this Di&s;&s;olution, to the Cour&s;e of petty Ju&s;tice, as afore&s;aid; for now all the Commi&s;&s;ions of the Peace Cea&s;ed, being Granted by the &s;aid Privy Council, and by the new E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Council which was now to be called <HI>The Council of Great-Britain,</HI> and which was to have the &s;ame Powers, and no other, which the Council of <HI>England</HI> had before; The Commi&s;&s;ions of the Peace could no more be Given by the Council, but by the Lord Chan|cellor; The Commi&s;&s;ions therefore Terminated, and the new Method of Admini&s;tration met with an Interruption of &s;everal Months, but was Re&s;tored again by a general Commi&s;&s;ion of the Peace, under the Great Seal of <HI>Britain,</HI> Nominating Ju&s;tices of the Peace thro' all <HI>Scotland,</HI> conform to the Method of <HI>England;</HI> This Com|mi&s;&s;ion bears Date the 13 Day of <HI>May Anno</HI> 1708. And on this Foot the whole I&s;land now &s;tands in one Form of Admini&s;tration, as to petty Ju&s;tice, and therefore this Act is called, <HI>An Act for rendring the &V;nion more compleat;</HI> Which Act for the more parti|cular under&s;tanding this Affair, I have added in the <HI>Appendix,</HI> N^o^. (H. 3.) But here it is to be ob&s;erved, That tho' this Act gives Power to all the Ju&s;tices of the Peace in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to <HI>Do, &V;&s;e, and Exerci&s;e over all Per&s;ons within their &s;everal Bounds, whatever doth appertain to the Office, and Trust of a Ju&s;tice of Peace, by virtue of the Laws in</HI> England <HI>before the &V;nion, in Relation to or for the Pre&s;erva|tion of the Publick Peace;</HI> Yet it is provided, That <HI>in all the Se&s;&s;ions of the Peace, they are pre&s;cribed to the Methods of Tryal and Judgment, according to the Laws of</HI> Scotland.</P>
<P>This I Note here, becau&s;e &s;ome would have &s;ugge&s;ted, That this Erecting of Courts of petty Ju&s;tice, <HI>For &s;uch the &s;everal Se&s;&s;ions of the Ju&s;tices properly are</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> &amp; Giving them Authorities from the Laws
<PB N="28" REF="589">
and U&s;age of <HI>England,</HI> was an Inva&s;ion of the Nineteenth Article of the Union&mdash;, but it was clear otherwi&s;e, for tho' in the Pub|lick Peace their Methods were the &s;ame as in <HI>England,</HI> yet it is ob|&s;ervable;<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That very Clau&s;e was Enacted in <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the &s;everal Acts of Parliament of 1661, recited in the Commi&s;&s;ion, and never Re&s;cinded in <HI>Scotland;</HI> And by the Union tho&s;e Acts are of cour&s;e Confirmed, not being any way incon&s;i&s;tent with or contradicting the Treaty.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Had it not been &s;o, the Thing it &s;elf had been no way Injurious to the Treaty of Union, the Methods of Tryal, Judge|ment, and Execution, being as above, pre&s;cribed by the Laws of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to continue in the &s;ame Form as before.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>And this will more particularly appear, in Reading the very Na|ture and Form of the Commi&s;&s;ions of the Peace Granted by the Queen, to the re&s;pective Counties or Shires in <HI>Scotland,</HI> One of which, <HI>viz.</HI> for the Shire of <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> For the more e&s;pecial un|der&s;tanding this Matter, I have annexed in the <HI>Appendix,</HI> part II. <HI>Numb.</HI> (G. 3.)</P>
<P>I might have entred here upon the Differences of Proceedings in the &s;everal new E&s;tabli&s;hed Courts of Ju&s;tice, as of the Exche|quer, and Admiralty, and the General and petty Se&s;&s;ions of the Ju&s;tices&mdash;; But the&s;e Things &s;eem not the proper Subject of a Hi&s;tory, &s;o I wave them here; The latter part al&s;o being very well performed to my hand, I mean, relating to the Proceedings and Office of a Ju&s;tice of the Peace in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by the Ingenious Hand of Mr. <HI>William Forbes</HI> Advocate in <HI>Scotland;</HI> To which I refer the Reader.</P>
<P>There was an Alteration in Matters of Ju&s;ticiary, as it is called in <HI>Scotland</HI>&mdash;; That is, of Criminal Proce&s;s; For whereas this was wholly left to a certain Court, con&s;i&s;ting of Five Judges, who were therefore called, <HI>The Lords of the Ju&s;ticiary,</HI> and that their Court was holden only at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> it was con&s;idered, that this was too great an Interruption of Ju&s;tice, and often times oc|ca&s;ioned the neglect of Pro&s;ecution, as well as made that Pro&s;ecu|tion both Difficult and Chargeable to the Subject, by which means Thefts, Violences, and &s;ometimes Murders e&s;caped due Puni&s;hment, the Parliament Determined by the &s;ame Act of Parliament, as be|fore, That the Lords of the Ju&s;ticiary &s;hould divide the Kingdom into Circuits, and that the&s;e Circuits &s;hould be Twice a Year&mdash;, that thus Ju&s;tice might, as in <HI>England,</HI> be carried Home to every Mans Door, and all the Former Inconveniencies might be for the future avoided.</P>
<P>The Manner, Methods, and other Circum&s;tances, &s;uch as Time, Place, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Since they were nothing at all Altered, the Act of Par|liament referring wholly to a former Law, made in the 3<HI>d.</HI> Se&s;&s;ion of the 2<HI>d.</HI> Parliament of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. came not under the Head
<PB N="29" REF="590">
of Alterations which I am now upon, and con&s;equently need not be in&s;erted.</P>
<P>I might bring the Alterations of Elections of Members for Par|liament into this Head, as well of the Lords as Commons; But it requires nothing, but to repeat the very Articles of the Union again; And I think it is &s;o expre&s;ly &s;et down there, that it needs no Comment at all, being nothing but meer Matter of Form; But as there required &s;ome Addition to the Manner of the Returning of Writs, and of the Managing Elections, you will find them in the &s;ame Act of Parliament la&s;t quoted, and printed in the <HI>Appendix</HI> as above&mdash;, all that Matter being fully determined in this Act&mdash;.</P>
<P>The Matter of the Exchequer Court now erected, needs no other De&s;cription than this, That it is erected in the &s;ame Form, and proceeds by the &s;ame Method as in <HI>England,</HI> having Barons, a Re|membrancer, Trea&s;urer, and all the re&s;pective Clerks and Offices as in <HI>England.</HI></P>

<P>The Admiralty Court in <HI>Scotland</HI> remained, and the Earl of <HI>Weemy&s;s,</HI> who was before Lord Admiral in <HI>Scotland,</HI> was now made Vice-Admiral, by Commi&s;&s;ion under the Prince of <HI>Denmark</HI> Lord High Admiral of <HI>Britain,</HI> and was, at the &s;ame time, nominated a Member of the Princes Council in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Inferior Courts of Judicature in the Admiralty remained as before, &s;uffering no Alteration in Form, &s;ave that what related to the Publick Revenue, or the Claims of the Sovereign, began to be modelled as in <HI>England,</HI> agreeable to the 18th. and 19th. Articles of the Union.</P>
<P>Thus the Law in <HI>Scotland</HI> remained intire, the Proce&s;s in Com|mon Cau&s;es being the &s;ame, and the Alterations being con&s;ined, as <HI>per</HI> the Treaty, to the E&s;tabli&s;hed Methods of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>I come now to the Coyn; And tho' this has been a Thing of great Con&s;equence, yet it requires little more to be &s;aid to it, than ju&s;t that it &s;uffered a general Revolution; And that all the former Coyns of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as well as the Foreign <HI>Species</HI> of Money which went current in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Money excepted, was Called in and Recoyned, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Money being only to pa&s;s current.</P>
<P>But there was a Difficulty which I have noted in the Minutes gave them &s;ome Trouble, <HI>viz:</HI> That the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Money, which went for one Penny in every Shilling Advance, &s;hould be reduced to a <HI>Par,</HI> that the Lo&s;s &s;hould be made good by the Government, and yet the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> not bring in great Quantities to <HI>Scotland,</HI> to be offered to the Mint at one Penny <HI>per</HI> Shilling, and immediately re|ceived again with an Allowance of the Difference: To prevent
<PB N="30" REF="591">
this, that Contrivance was found out, to bring in all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Money at one certain Day, and receive it out again with an Allow|ance for the Difference&mdash;; This occa&s;ioned the Proclamation for the Alteration, that all the Money &s;hould be paid in on a &s;hort Day, and immediately returned with Notes for the Difference; This Proclamation, as it expre&s;&s;es the whole Scheme, I have added in the <HI>Appendix, N^o.

<P>The &s;everal Proclamations for the gradual Calling in the Old Money, are too many to note here; It may &s;uffice to hint, That, as the Foreign Money being brought in, which amounted to above 150000 Pounds <HI>Sterling;</HI> And this going into the Mint, the New Coyn began to Circulate very &s;peedily; And, at the Writing the&s;e Sheets, the whole Nation was full of New Money.</P>

<P>I cannot &s;ay &s;o much for the New Regulations of Weights and Mea&s;ures, in which, tho' appointed by the Union to be made the &s;ame, little Progre&s;s could be made at the Writing of the&s;e Ac|counts, &s;ave that the Publick Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e was all &s;ettled by the Weights and Mea&s;ures of <HI>England;</HI> But Cu&s;tom had &s;o inured the People to the former Weights and Mea&s;ures, e&s;pecial|ly the Weights for their Retailing Goods, and the Mea&s;ures for Corn, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to bring the Change about &s;o &s;oon; Time alone can bring it to the I&s;&s;ue de&s;igned.</P>
<P>Nor is the reducing the Mea&s;ures to an Uniform Standart &s;o ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, as that we &s;hould think the Union Defective for want of it; Since the Mea&s;ures, <HI>e&s;pecially that which we call Dry Mea|&s;ure, as of Corn and Fruit,</HI> is at this time various almo&s;t all over <HI>England</HI>&mdash;; As particularly in the North, the <HI>Boll</HI> remains a received Mea&s;ure in <HI>Northumberland</HI> and <HI>Cumberland,</HI> in the We&s;t, as in <HI>Cornwal</HI> and <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> the Bu&s;hel is almo&s;t two Bu&s;hels of the common Mea&s;ure&mdash;; Even the <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> Bu&s;hel, which is the Standart of Mea&s;ure in <HI>England,</HI> varies, and in &s;ome places it contains eight Gallons, in others nine Gallons, in &s;ome places they have one to the Score thrown into the Mea&s;ure, in other places not&mdash;; Again, in Liquid Mea&s;ure we have the Quart of two kinds for &s;everal Liquors, as the Wine Quart and the <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> Quart, we have the Pottle and Gallon for dry Mea&s;ure, the Pint and thence up to the Gallon of Liquid Mea&s;ure; in Coals we have what is called the Chalder at <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> and the Chalder at <HI>London,</HI> and the differ|ing Chalder in &s;everal differing parts&mdash;; At <HI>London</HI> the Chalder is 36 Bu&s;hels, at <HI>Sandwich</HI> 32, at <HI>Lym</HI> 40, at <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> 70 Bu&s;hels; So, tho' the Mea&s;ures of Corn and Liquors &s;hould have their Varia|tions in <HI>Scotland,</HI> according to the old Cu&s;toms and U&s;age of Towns, Counties, and Manners, yet this does not at all render the Union incompleat; Since the reducing the Weights and Mea&s;ures to an equal Standart in the Publick Accounts, &s;uch as in the Cu&s;toms, Tolls, Exci&s;es, Publick Receipts and Payments, <HI>and the like,</HI> is as effectual an Equality as is needful; And indeed is as much as was intended by the Union, no Act of Parliament, Law, or Statute that can be made, being able to oblige the Countrey People in eve|ry place to leave off their wonted Calculations and Denominations of Things, which are frequently made upon the Foot of their An|cient Cu&s;toms; <HI>For Example, as before,</HI> the Valuation of Lands, Tenor of Lea&s;es, the Rents, the Entails, Rent-Charges, Liferents, and Payments for, or out of Land Revenue, are all reckoned in <HI>Scotland</HI> by the <HI>Chalder, Boll, Firlot,</HI> and <HI>Lippy,</HI> and cannot be altered; Even Marriage Settlements and Entails are entered in this manner; And it would run <HI>Scotland</HI> into all manner of Con|fu&s;ion, to oblige them at once to leave off all the Terms, by which their Lands are known Valued, Mortgaged, Entailed, Charged or Conveyed.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="594">
I think we have thus gently touch'd at all the Alterations of Moment which were made in the Laws, Trade, Cu&s;tom and Con|&s;titution of <HI>Scotland,</HI> according to my Title; But le&s;t it may be thought, That the&s;e Alterations ly too much di&s;per&s;ed up and down this Book, in the Relation of particular Ca&s;es, I &s;hall endea|vour to &s;um them up in the following Abridgement.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> As to the Con&s;titution, tho' la&s;t named&mdash;, I conceive it &s;uffered &s;ome Alteration, tho' not, as was alledged by &s;ome, an intire Di&s;&s;olution&mdash;; It was not di&s;&s;olved, becau&s;e the Govern|ment by King and Parliament continued the &s;ame, <HI>viz.</HI> A Limit|ed Monarchy; It received no Diminution, but an Addition of Privileges and Liberties; And had the <HI>Scots</HI> thought &s;it to have gone a little further, and made Provi&s;ion for Transferring their Su|periorities, they might have at la&s;t come to an intire Enjoyment of that &s;ame Liberty that <HI>England</HI> is now &s;o happy in&mdash;; How|ever, tho' the Con&s;titution received no Di&s;&s;olution, yet it is ac|knowledged, that it &s;uffered Alterations in &s;everal Articles, of which the&s;e are the principal.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That tho the Monarchy is the &s;ame, yet that they be|come Incorporated into one Monarchy with their Neighbour Kingdom, &s;ubjected for ever to the &s;ame Sovereign, and en|gaged in War, Peace, Alliances and Succe&s;&s;ion with them; So that they can no more act in their &s;eparate Capacity, in any Thing relating to Government or Con&s;titution.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. They &s;uffer Alterations in their Repre&s;entative&mdash;, and the&s;e con&s;i&s;t in Two Branches; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That the Number of their Repre&s;entative is reduced to 45. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That the Electi|ons pa&s;s under a new Regulation, and are managed by a dif|ferent Method. And, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> That they Sit not any more in Parliament by them&s;elves, but in Conjunction with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament, Repre&s;enting the &s;everal Counties and Corporati|ons, as Members of the United Kingdom of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Hereditary Branch of Parliament, I mean the Peers, &s;uffer al&s;o an Alteration, being changed from a full Appear|ance in Parliament to a Repre&s;entative Appearance, and that Repre&s;entative Limited to the Number of Sixteen.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Their Regal Admini&s;tration &s;uffers an Alteration; The Sovereign, who before executed the Civil Power in a &s;eparate Capacity, being now obliged to change the Face of that Ad|mini&s;tration into an United Management, Governing now by One Parliament, One Privy Council, One High Admiral, One Chancery, One Trea&s;ury&mdash;; And, in &s;hort, One ge|neral Oeconomy of Government&mdash;; Thus the &s;everal di|&s;tinct Offices of Admiral, Chancellor, Trea&s;urer, Secretaries of State, and Pre&s;ident of Privy Council, &s;unk in either King|dom, and New Commi&s;&s;ions were i&s;&s;ued&mdash;; As One Pri|vy Council, and One Pre&s;ident, under the Title of Lord Pre|&s;ident of the Privy Council of <HI>Britain,</HI> Lord High Chancellor of <HI>Britain,</HI> Lord High Trea&s;urer of <HI>Britain,</HI> Lord High Admi|ral
<PB N="34" REF="595">
of <HI>Britain,</HI> and the like, and which I clo&s;e all with, the Queen her &s;elf lays down her &s;eparate Titles, and is now no more Queen of <HI>England, Scotland, &amp;c.</HI> But Queen of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and is called in Mi&s;&s;ives, and in Foreign Accounts, Her <HI>Britannick</HI> Maje&s;ty&mdash;; Her Troops are no more <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> and <HI>Scots,</HI> but <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Forces&mdash;; And the Arms of the I&s;land are a new Incorporated and Quartered together&mdash;, as appears at large in the foregoing Sheets.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>This, I think, is the Sum of the principal Alterations in the Con&s;titution of <HI>Scotland</HI> by the Union; In all which, except that of the Parliament, the Commons being reduced in Number, and the Lords by Repre&s;entative; I &s;ay, in all the re&s;t, <HI>England</HI> &s;uffer|ed the &s;ame Alterations as <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;uch as di&s;&s;olving her Parlia|ment, her Name as a Kingdom, her Council, Great Offices, and Title of her Sovereign&mdash;; And all things began <HI>de novo</HI> in both Kingdoms, under the &s;ingle Denomination of <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>Briti&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;econd Head of Alterations is that of the Laws; And this is &s;o particularly entered into in the beginning of this very Part of my Work, that I need be but very &s;hort.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Laws of Government continue as the Government continues e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the Claim of Right, I mean as to the Limitations of Government and Obedience; Nor has <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;uffered any Lo&s;s, but rather been a manife&s;t Gainer in this Point by the Union; The Privy Council Tyranny being a|boli&s;h'd, who had arrived to that Height in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as to give their Acts almo&s;t of an equal Authority to Acts of Parlia|ment&mdash;; A Power wholly di&s;claimed by the Privy Coun|cil in <HI>England,</HI> to who&s;e Powers and Authorities the pre&s;ent Council of <HI>Britain</HI> is by Parliament expre&s;ly Limited and Confined.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Laws of Private Right have &s;uffered no Alteration, other than as Private Right may be intermix'd with that of the Crown&mdash;; But all the Laws of Publick Right, &s;uch as relate to Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;es, have &s;uffered the Alterations mentioned in the Union, a Court of Exchequer being e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd in <HI>Scotland</HI> for that purpo&s;e; And this was nece&s;&s;ary, as has been noted, becau&s;e of the Alterations nece&s;&s;ary in the Revenue, and in the re&s;pective Methods of A&s;certaining and Collecting the Cu&s;toms, Exci&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> due to the Crown; And in this Clau&s;e may be included the &s;everal Laws for Pe|nalties, Fines, Forfeitures, and Confi&s;cations, upon the par|ticular Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es of the Laws relating to Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;e, which were wholly new&mdash;.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Governing Laws relating to the Civil Peace have &s;uffered &s;ome Alteration, as to what was ju&s;t before the Uni|on by the Erecting Ju&s;tices of the Peace; But this &s;eems a Re|&s;toring what was before, rather than an Alteration of what was, &s;ince it was nothing but what was actually put in Practice
<PB N="35" REF="596">
twice before, and what there were Laws then in Being to ju|&s;tify their Return. So all the Alterations that &s;eem to be made now, were, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Only that the Ju&s;tices of Peace formerly had their Commi&s;&s;ion from the Privy Council in <HI>Scotland,</HI> but now received it from the Lord Chancellor of <HI>Britain</HI>&mdash;; And, <HI>Se|condly,</HI> That the Ju&s;tices of Peace had &s;ome new Powers ve&s;ted in them &s;ince the Union, which they had not before, &s;uch as determining Di&s;putes in the Duty of Exci&s;e, giving Power of Di&s;tre&s;s for Payment, Warrants of Forcible Entries, in ca&s;e of Concealments of Cu&s;toms, and the like.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>All the re&s;t of the Laws of <HI>Scotland</HI> remained the &s;ame <HI>per</HI> the Union; The Circuits of the Lords of the Ju&s;ticiary I take al&s;o to be no Innovation at all, as what had formerly been practi&s;ed.</P>
<P>I come now to Alterations of Trade; And the&s;e can receive but a very &s;hort De&s;cription here, becau&s;e the greate&s;t Alte|rations which happened in Trade, could not follow the Union &s;o clo&s;s at the Heels, as the Time of the Writing the&s;e Sheets require to relate it; But &s;uch as were immediately the Con&s;equence of the Union, were &s;uch as the&s;e,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. A general Prohibition and Stop of Commerce with <HI>France,</HI> which, till now, <HI>Scotland</HI> publickly carryed on.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. A Prohibition of all Exports and Imports as in <HI>England;</HI> And by virtue of that Clau&s;e, a particular Prohibition of the Exportation of Wool, which was, till then, publickly allow|ed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and which, tho' People &s;eemed at fir&s;t very unea&s;y at, yet was, without Doubt, very much for the Pub|lick Advantage of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who&s;e Manufactures were thereby quite &s;unk as to Exportation&mdash;; This Article was attended with Penalties and Forfeitures particular, and &s;uch as were not practi&s;ed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and for which the Laws of Exci&s;e and Cu&s;toms in <HI>England</HI> were introduced, and the Trials on which were brought on, either before the Ju&s;tices of Peace, or Court of Exchequer, as above.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Whereas <HI>Scotland</HI> had, before this, prohibited all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Woollen Manufactures, under &s;evere Penalties, and <HI>England,</HI> on the other Hand, had excluded the <HI>Scots</HI> from Trading with <HI>Scots</HI> Ships to their Colonies in <HI>America,</HI> directly from <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had Confi&s;cated even their own <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships Trading to the &s;aid Colonies from <HI>England,</HI> if Navigat|ed or Manned with above one Third <HI>Scots</HI> Seamen, had laid Tolls and heavy Impo&s;ts upon Cattel and Linen Imported into <HI>England</HI> from <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had prohibited the Exportation of Corn from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Scotland,</HI> tho' the Occa&s;ion of it might be never &s;o great, but on the &s;ame Conditions, and under the &s;ame Re&s;trictions as to other Countries; Now, by the Uni|on, all the&s;e Prohibitions, Re&s;traints, Tolls, Impo&s;ts, and Exclu&s;ions on either Hand, were taken off; The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Growth and Manufactures, formerly prohibited, came immediately, free of all Interruptions into <HI>Scotland;</HI> All the Tolls and Im|po&s;ts
<PB N="36" REF="597">
upon <HI>Scots</HI> Cattel, Linen, or other Goods in <HI>England,</HI> were taken off; All the Ports of <HI>England,</HI> whether in <HI>Europe</HI> or <HI>America,</HI> were open to <HI>Scots</HI> Ships, without any Impo&s;ts or Re&s;traint; <HI>Scots</HI> Sailers in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bottoms were immediately free, and Ships from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies might Sail to, and Unlade free in <HI>Scotland,</HI> without any Ob&s;truction.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The&s;e I call Alterations in the Laws of Trade; Be&s;ides which, there were &s;ome particular Alterations which relate to the Draw|backs, Bounties, and Allowances on the Exportation, and for Encouragement of the Exportation of Fi&s;h, Corn, Pork, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Of which I need &s;ay nothing, having been very particular already in the Relation of the Debates upon tho&s;e Heads in Parliament.</P>
<P>The Con&s;equences of the&s;e Things upon Trade are at pre&s;ent few, but will nece&s;&s;arily be far greater hereafter&mdash;; The fir&s;t vi&s;ible Con&s;equence was the Ri&s;e and Fall of &s;everal kinds of Mer|chandizes, as the new Alterations, Prohibitions, or Importations of them happened, differing from what they were before.</P>
<P>As for Example, Wines, Brandy, and all kinds of Goods of the Growth of <HI>France,</HI> mu&s;t of Cour&s;e ri&s;e in their Value, the further Import being prohibited; And this would have enrich'd a great many Families in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who had Quantities of the&s;e Goods on their Hands, had not the Difficulty of Enforcing the&s;e Prohibitions at fir&s;t laid Trade open to Clande&s;tine Importations, by which the Fair Trader was, as in &s;uch Ca&s;es always happens, a very great Sufferer.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> All the Goods of the Growth of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies, or which were to be had from <HI>England,</HI> being now Imported directly to <HI>Scotland,</HI> began to come as the Return of the <HI>Scots</HI> Manufactures&mdash;; Several Ships being laden from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> the very fir&s;t Year after the Union.</P>
<P>Another Con&s;equence of this Union in Trade, was the letting fall almo&s;t all the Woollen Manufactures, which had been erected in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and where they began to come to &s;ome Perfection in making Broad Cloth, Druggets, and Stuffs of all &s;orts; But, upon the Opening the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade, they were immediately &s;o Throng'd with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods of the &s;ame &s;orts &s;o much cheaper, that it ap|peared tho&s;e Things would die of Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Tho' indeed this &s;eemed to be &s;ome Blow to their Trade, and particularly to the Imployment of their Poor, yet, at the &s;ame time, the Duties upon Linen from <HI>Scotland</HI> being taken off in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> made &s;o great a Demand for <HI>Scots</HI> Linen more than u&s;ual, that it &s;eemed the Poor could want no Imployment; And &s;everal kinds of Linen being &s;et to Work by <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, which never be|fore were made, or at lea&s;t for Exportation in <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;uch as Sail-Cloths, Canvas, Damask, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is thought, the Imployment of the Poor was not le&s;&s;ened by this Alteration.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, the Lower and Cour&s;er Manufactures in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> which were made of their own Wool, &s;eemed to increa&s;e, and not only found a larger Vent in <HI>Scotland,</HI> but were bought up
<PB N="37" REF="598">
by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants, who brought other Stuffs thither, and &s;old in <HI>England;</HI> And the&s;e Manufactures are not unlikely to ri&s;e to a con&s;iderable Height, &s;uch as <HI>Stirling</HI> Serges, in <HI>England</HI> called <HI>Shaloons, Mu&s;&s;elburgh</HI> Stuffs, and the like; And we find in <HI>England</HI> &s;ome Propo&s;als from the <HI>African</HI> Company, for the making <HI>Guinea</HI> Stuffs there, which perhaps may in time come to be very con&s;ide|rable.</P>
<P>I might enter here into the Schemes and Projects, which have made much Noi&s;e in the World for Improvement of Fi&s;hing in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> and of Navigation and building Ships in <HI>Scotland;</HI> But as the&s;e things have yet made no Alterations in the Trade, and are but in <HI>Embrio</HI> at the Writing the&s;e Sheets, I cannot mingle them here as Matter of Hi&s;tory, but have touch'd them more at large in the Preface.</P>
<P>It remains only to &s;peak of the Alterations of the Cu&s;toms&mdash;; And this would have required a long Table of the &s;everal Duties and Impo&s;t formerly paid in <HI>Scotland</HI> upon the Export and Import of Merchandizes&mdash;; But having already given an Account, That the whole Cu&s;toms are &s;ettled upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Foot; And the Duties of all Kinds being too large to in&s;ert here, and already Print|ed in the Book of Rates, Re-printed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> it would be a Vain Labour to recite the Particulars: And as to the Difference between the Duties on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Foot, and the Duties as paid be|fore, it required the very &s;ame Recital of Particulars, the Length of which would be intolerable; And for this Rea&s;on, tho' I have re|ferred to &s;ome Schemes &s;aid to be in the &s;econd part of this <HI>Appen|dix,</HI> and which I received from the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e in <HI>Scotland,</HI> yet when I came to find upon Examination, that the Tack&s;men of the Cu&s;toms in <HI>Scotland</HI> u&s;ually compounded with the Merchants, and reduced the &s;aid Cu&s;toms to what Sum they plea&s;ed, I cho&s;e to omit a Scheme, which, when put down, would give the Reader no certain Gue&s;s at the Thing, and con&s;equently &s;ignify no|thing.</P>
<P>If any Man &s;hould enquire, Whether, upon the whole of the&s;e Alterations in Trade, <HI>Scotland</HI> is Gainer or Lo&s;er, I mu&s;t ac|knowledge, it is a difficult Point to re&s;olve at &s;o &s;mall a Di|&s;tance from the Fini&s;hing the Union; But, as to the Profit of the Trade between <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England</HI> in particular, as it ap|pears at the Writing the&s;e Sheets, I &s;hall leave the Impartial Ob|&s;erver to gue&s;s by the&s;e Two Particulars.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That about Seventeen Ships from the &s;everal Ports of <HI>Scotland</HI> are already fitted out, and &s;ent away to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies, who&s;e Loading is certainly the Product of the Ground, or Labour of the Poor, and who&s;e Return mu&s;t be in Sugar, Tobacco, Cotton, Indico, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and Money&mdash;.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That above 170000 Bolls of Corn of &s;undry &s;orts has already been Shipped off from <HI>Scotland</HI> for <HI>England,</HI> be&s;ides a very great Quantity bought up by <HI>England,</HI> and Shipp'd di|rectly for <HI>Portugal;</HI> Both the&s;e Articles are Additions to the
<PB N="38" REF="599">
Trade of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and both within little more than a Year immediately &s;ucceeding the Union of the I&s;land: What fur|ther Encrea&s;e of Commerce may accrue to <HI>Scotland,</HI> when the&s;e Bloody Wars &s;hall end, and when Peace &s;hall be re&s;tor|ed to <HI>Europe,</HI> I &s;hall not pretend to Examine; But there &s;eems to be no Que&s;tion, but the Trade of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;tands fair for very great Improvements.</ITEM>

<P>THE Commi&s;&s;ion of the General A&s;&s;embly of this National Church, having under their mo&s;t &s;erious Con&s;ideration; That the great and weighty Affair of a Treaty of Union, be|tween the two Nations, is now laid before the Parliament; And how much the Re&s;ult of their Determinations, with Re&s;pect to the &s;ame, may prove of the highe&s;t Con&s;equence; both to this Church and Nation in all their Intere&s;ts Civil and Religious; And that both to the pre&s;ent, and &s;ucceeding Generations; Con&s;idering likewi&s;e, that the abounding and continued Encrea&s;e of Impiety, Popery and Prophanne&s;s through the Land, the abu&s;e of the Privileges and Mer|cies, we have enjoyed, and hitherto, through the Infinite Goodne&s;s, and Long-&s;uffering Patience of GOD do &s;till enjoy, our &V;nthank|fulne&s;s for, and &V;nfruitfulne&s;s, under the Go&s;pel; Our Formality, Decay of Zeal and &s;lackne&s;s in Promoving according to our Stations, the much called for Work, of Sincere Per&s;onal and National Refor|mation; May ju&s;tly provoke the Righteous and Holy GOD, to re|move our Ble&s;&s;ings, to &s;mite us in his hot Di&s;plea&s;ure; and for our Sins to leave our Rulers in this va&s;tly important, and difficult Exigence wherein there is &s;o much need of clear and unprejudicated Light, and of Harmony, and Onene&s;s in the LORD: They have therefore judg|ed it incumbent upon them to excite them&s;elves, and all the People of GOD in the Land to much Seriou&s;ne&s;s, Diligence, and continued Fervour in applying to the Throne of Grace, upon &s;o great and mo|mentuous Affairs: And they do hereby mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly and earne&s;tly Recommend to all the Presbytries within this National Church; To appoint, &s;et a part, and ob&s;erve a Day, for &s;olemn publick Prayer, Fa&s;ting and Humiliation, in all the Curches within their Re&s;pective Bounds, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; For which End the Moderators of the &s;everal Presbytries are to call them <HI>pro re nata,</HI> as &s;oon as this comes to their Hand; And farder, that Presbytries continue to keep among them&s;elves, and Mini&s;ters with their Se&s;&s;ions, Dyets, for per&s;i&s;ting in&s;tant in prayer to GOD, and for pre&s;erving upon their own Spirits, and of all the Lords People, a due Concern about their proper duty with Re&s;pect unto the Church of CHRIST, and the great Affairs now in Agitarion.</P>

<P>THAT as by the CLAIM OF RIGHT, it is the Privilege of all Subjects to Petition: So at this Time, being mo&s;tly Impow|ered by Our <HI>CONSTIT&V;ENTS;</HI> and knowing the SENTI|MENTS of the PEOPLE We Repre&s;ent: It is Our Indi&s;pen&s;ible DUTY, to Signifie to Your Grace, and the Honourable E&s;tates of Parliament. That as We are not again&s;t an Honourable and Safe U|nion with <HI>England,</HI> Con&s;i&s;ting with the BEING OF THIS KING|DOM, and PARLIAMENT thereof: Without which, We con|ceive neither Our RELIGION, nor Our CIVIL INTERESTS and TRADE, as We now, by LAW, Enjoy them, can be Secured to Us, and Our Po&s;terity, far le&s;s can We expect to have the Condition of the PEOPLE of SCOTLAND, with Relation to the&s;e great Con|cerns, made Better and Improven, without a SCOTS PARLIA|MENT.</P>
<P>AND, Seing by the Articles of Union, now under the Con&s;iderati|on of the Honourable E&s;tates of Parliament, It is agreed, That SCOT|LAND and <HI>England</HI> &s;hall be United into one Kingdom; And that the united Kingdoms be united by one and the Same Parliament. By which Our MONARCHY is Suppre&s;t, Our PARLIAMENTS Extin|gui&s;hed; and in Con&s;equence, Our RELIGION, CHURCH-GO|VERNMENT, CLAIM OF RIGHT, LAWS, LIBERTIES, TRADE, and all that is Dear to Us, daily in Danger of being Encroached upon, altered, or wholly Subverted by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> in a <HI>Briti&s;h-Para|liament:</HI> Wherein, the Mean Repre&s;entation allowed for SCOT|LAND, can never Signifie in Securing to us the INTEREST Re&s;er|ved by us, or granted to us by the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>And by the&s;e <HI>Articles,</HI> Our Poor PEOPLE are made liable to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Taxes, which is a certain un&s;upportable Burden; Con&s;ide|ring, That the Trade Propo&s;ed is Uncertain, Involved, and wholly

<P>We acknowledge it is in the Power of the pre&s;ent Parliament, to give Remi&s;&s;ions to the Sub&s;cribers of the fore&s;aid Articles; and we heartily wi&s;h for a good Agreement among&s;t all the Members of the Parliament, &s;o as it may tend to the Safety and Pre&s;ervation of both CHURCH and STATE, with all the Privileges belonging thereto, within the Kingdom of <HI>SCOTLAND.</HI></P>
<P>But if the Sub&s;cribers of the fore&s;aid Treaty and Union, with their A&s;&s;ociats in Parliament, &s;hall pre&s;ume to carry on the &s;aid &V;ni|on, by a &s;upream Power, over the Belly of the Generality of this Nation: Then, and in that Ca&s;e, as we judge, that the Con&s;ent of the Generality of the &s;ame, can only Dive&s;t them of their Sacred and Civil Libertys, Purcha&s;ed and Maintained by our <HI>ANCESTORS</HI> with their Blood: So we prote&s;t, whatever Ratification of the fore&s;aid &V;nion may pa&s;s in Parliament, contrair to our Fundamental Laws, Liberties, and Privileges, concerning Church and State, may not be binding upon the Nation, now or at any Time to come: And par|ticularly we prote&s;t again&s;t the Approbation of the fir&s;t Article of the &s;aid &V;nion, before the Privileges of this Nation, contain'd in the other Articles had been adju&s;ted and &s;ecured: And &s;o we ear|ne&s;tly Require, that the Repre&s;entatives in Parliament, who are for Our Nation's Privileges, would give timeous Warning to all the Corners of the Kingdom; That we and our Po&s;terity become not Tributary and Bond-&s;laves to our Neighbours, without acquiting our &s;elves, as becomes Men and Chri&s;tians: And we are Confident, that the Souldiers now in Martial Power, have &s;o much of the Spi|rits of <HI>Scots men;</HI> that they are not ambitions to be Di&s;po&s;ed of, at the plea&s;ure of another Nation: And we hereby Declare, that we have no De&s;ign again&s;t them in this Matter.</P>

<P>The Articles are as follows.<LIST>

<HEAD>Again&s;t which Articles and Addre&s;s Propo&s;ed, the &s;aids Elders did before the Vote prote&s;t, and take In&s;tru|ments in the Hands of the Clerk of the Commi&s;&s;ion; <HI>For the Rea&s;ons following.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The Commi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly</HI> having already Addre&s;t to the Parliament for Securing the Doctrine, Wor&s;hip, Di&s;|cipline and Government of this Church; And that Addre&s;s being read in the Hou&s;e upon the 17<HI>th</HI> of <HI>October</HI> la&s;t, The Parliament did thereupon Declare, that before concluding the &V;nion, they would take the &s;aid Addre&s;s to their Con&s;ideration, and would do every Thing nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ecuring the true Prote&s;tant Religion and Church Government pre&s;ently by Law e&s;tabli&s;hed in this Kingdom; Which A&s;&s;urance we conceive the Commi&s;&s;ion may very well rely u|pon, Seeing it is not to be doubted, that the Parliament will in due Time when the Addre&s;s is taken to Con&s;ideration, make all nece&s;&s;a|ry Provi&s;ions for Securing our Religion and Church Government by Law e&s;tabli&s;hed; And it may be con&s;tructed Jealousie or Diffidence in this Commi&s;&s;ion to pre&s;s and pur&s;ue the &s;aid Addre&s;s further, be|fore
<PB N="17" REF="616">
it appear what Steps and Progre&s;s the Parliament &s;hall make u+pon it, E&s;pecially &s;eeing there are &s;o many Elders of this Commi&s;&s;ion who are Members of the Hou&s;e: And being heartily Concerned for the Churches Intere&s;t, will certainly take Care that Nothing be Om|mitted or forgot to be Repre&s;ented in Parliament which is Nece&s;&s;ary for the Churches Security.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Parliament having upon the 15<HI>th</HI> of <HI>October</HI> la&s;t, Voted to proceed pre&s;ently to the Con&s;ideration of the Articles of the Treaty of &V;nion, which might be Known to all by the publi&s;hed Minutes, We conceive it not Decent or &s;uitable to the Prudence of this Com|mi&s;&s;ion to pre&s;ent an new Addre&s;s Relating to the Subject of the for|mer: whereby the Hou&s;e may be impeded in its Procedure, which may cau&s;e a longer Delay of Con&s;idering the fir&s;t Addre&s;s by Occa&s;io|ning new Que&s;tions and Debates in the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">3. The 6<HI>th</HI> Article of the now intended Addre&s;s, contains Matters which we conceive are not within the Sphere and Compa&s;s of the Commi&s;&s;ions Bu&s;ine&s;s pre&s;cribed to them by the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly.</HI> Yet a wide Step is made in quarrelling and Objecting to the Con&s;titution of the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> the Repre&s;entative of that Nation, with which this is now in a Treaty about an Union, likeways in that Ar|ticle the Form and Frame of the Civil Policy and Government of <HI>England,</HI> in the Extent and Latitude of it, Agreeable to it's Laws is Reflected upon and Challenged; all which in our Opinion, In|&s;inuates a Blaming and Condemning our Parliament for Treating of an Union with a Kingdom &s;o Circum&s;tantiated as <HI>England</HI> is.</P>
<P N="4">4. Whatever the Con&s;titution of the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> now is, and whatever may be the Con&s;titution of the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain</HI> after the Union, the pre&s;ent legal E&s;tabli&s;hment of our Church is not alterable by it, that being without the bounds of the Treaty, which can reach no farther than the Civil Policy and Go|vernment of the United Kingdom; Be&s;ides that our legal E&s;tabli&s;h|ment will no doubt be further Fenced and Fortified, when the Com|mi&s;&s;ions Addre&s;s is taken into Con&s;ideration by the Parliament.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Parliament having upon the fourth of this Month, Voted that the two Kingdoms of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> &s;hall upon the fir&s;t Day of <HI>May</HI> next En&s;uing, and for ever after be &V;nited into one Kingdom by the Name of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> with this Provi&s;ion (That if the Articles of Union be not adju&s;ted by the Parliament, then the Agreeing to and Approving of the fir&s;t &s;hall be of no Effect) We Ap|prehend it may be of Dangerous Con&s;equence to pre&s;ent now any Addre&s;s which may Admit of a Con&s;truction oppo&s;ite to that Vote in Parliament; And certainly it would not be Excu&s;eable in any who are Members in the Hou&s;e, to concurr in an Addre&s;s of that &s;ort.</P>
<P>So being fully per&s;waded that the way of proceeding by the New Addre&s;s now intended, will tend to the great Di&s;advantage and Prejudice of the Church as now E&s;tabli&s;hed, and of the Presbyterian Intere&s;t, we found our &s;elves obliged to Enter our Di&s;&s;ent and to Prote&s;t.</P>

<P>We Heartily Wi&s;h this debate Sopite, and that yet it would plea&s;e them to take up this Paper, perhaps on more Mature and &s;econd Thoughts, they may &s;ee there is no Ground to be &s;o &s;evere again&s;t our &s;econd Addre&s;s, As to Cen&s;ure it as Jealou&s;ie or Diffidence of the Parliament or our Friends in it, as in the fir&s;t Rea&s;ons; and of Indecency and Un&s;uitable to Prudence, as Rea&s;on &s;econd, or Dan|gerous and &s;uch as may be con&s;trued, as contrary to a Vote of Parlia|ment <HI>November</HI> 4<HI>th</HI> as in Rea&s;on 5<HI>th.</HI> For the fir&s;t Addre&s;s being General, the &s;econd was but a humble Repre&s;entation of &s;ome par|ticulars we humbly de&s;ired might be minded, when it plea&s;ed the Par|liament to re&s;ume the Con&s;ideration of the fir&s;t Addre&s;s, leaving the time to the Wi&s;dom of the Parliament, we being far from any de&s;ign to occa&s;ion Delay or Debate; and it hath plea&s;ed the Parliament to in|&s;ert diver&s;e of the Things there de&s;ired in the Act for the <HI>Security of the Church,</HI> and we would gladly hope they will con&s;ider the re&s;t of them in due time.</P>
<P>But we conceive it is the 6<HI>th</HI> Article again&s;t which the chief Offence is taken, and again&s;t which the 3<HI>d</HI> and 4<HI>th</HI> Rea&s;ons are levelled, but our Honourable Friends know, there had been much Rea&s;oning on that Head for diver&s;e days, and when there was no appearance of &V;nanimity, how could the Commi&s;&s;ion &s;hun a Vote for Deci&s;ion of the Difference, nor can we be per&s;waded that the Commi&s;&s;ion went in their Vote without the Sphere and Compa&s;s of the Bu&s;ine&s;s pre|&s;cribed to them by the General A&s;&s;embly, or made a wide Step in quarrelling and objecting to the Con&s;titution of the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> as is alledged in Rea&s;on 3<HI>d.</HI> For it was oft told in the Con|ference

<P>YOur Letter &s;igned by the R: Mr. <HI>Car&s;tairs</HI> Moderator <HI>pro tem Pore</HI> we received this Day, being our fir&s;t Meeting after its Date of the 6th In&s;tant; wherein there is mention of your being informed of Di&s;orders and Tumults in &s;ome parts of the Countrey, which you recommend unto us to di&s;countenance and di&s;coursge as we have Acce&s;s.</P>
<P>We know there have been many Reports &s;pread Abroad of Tu|mults and Di&s;orders, not only in <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> which is too true, but in other places within the Shire of <HI>Lanerk;</HI> which as to the bounds of our Presbytery are gro&s;ly fal&s;e. And we have rea&s;on to believe them to be &s;o likewi&s;e, as to the re&s;t of the Shire. We have heard al&s;o of &s;ome calumnious Stories indu&s;triou&s;ly di&s;&s;eminated, concerning &s;ome of our Number, with re&s;pect to the&s;e pretended Di&s;orders, which are not only contrary to Truth, but to common Sen&s;e. We wi&s;h the Forgers and Spreaders may be forgiven. They act in this neither the part of good Chri&s;tians, nor of good Subjects.</P>
<P>As to the Di&s;po&s;ition of the People, the plain Truth is, That they are generally mo&s;t aver&s;e from the Union; and many have expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves broadly enough again&s;t it, as what they fear may prove an irremediable Evil, if it &s;hould be concluded, wi&s;hing that &s;ome Stop might be put to it. And we have not been wanting, as there was occa&s;ion, to advi&s;e and exhort the People to Calmne&s;s and Regularity, and to refrain from any undue Keenne&s;s might be in their Words. But we mu&s;t &s;ay, That it is utterly fal&s;e and malicious to &s;ugge&s;t, that there hath been the lea&s;t Tumult or irregular Practice among them, &s;ince this &V;nion came in Que&s;tion, far le&s;s any &s;hadow or Appearance of any Undutiful or Di&s;loyal Thought of Her Maje&s;ty. Yea there has not been &s;o much as the lea&s;t Motion towards their accu&s;tomed ordinary Rendezvous warranted by Law, &s;ince the publi&s;hing of a Proclamation and Act, forbidding the &s;ame: It is true, That &s;ome of tho&s;e Ra&s;h Youths who broke out from <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed thro' our Bounds, but they were not allowed to make any &s;tay, nor received the lea&s;t En|couragement at any Hand, for ought we know: So that we can well a&s;&s;ure the R. Commi&s;&s;ion, there is as much Peace and Quiet with|in the whole Bounds of this Presbytery, as is any Place of the King|dom.</P>
<P>We have heard with much Satisfaction, of the Zeal which the R.

<HEAD>MEMORANDUM For the Honourable E&s;tates of Parliament.</HEAD>
<P><HI>PRimo,</HI> It is humbly intreated, That in ca&s;e the &V;nion be con|cluded, that for pre&s;erving the Peace of the Nation and Re|dre&s;&s;ing of Grievances of the Church, the Privy Council may be continued, or &s;ome Court E&s;tabli&s;hed for judging in &s;uch Ca&s;es as were formerly judged by the Council, and this Church may corre&s;|pond with them for Fa&s;ts and Thank&s;givings. <HI>Secundo,</HI> The Intere&s;ts of diver&s;e Heretors, as well as the Exigents of the Church will require, that there be &s;ome fixed Court to do the Work of the Commi&s;&s;ion for Plantation of Kirks and Valuation of Teinds, which is the more ne|ce&s;&s;ary, in re&s;pect of the great prejudice the Church has &s;u&s;tained for want thereof, and that this Court be impowered to make up the Re|gi&s;ters of the Commi&s;&s;ions of former Parliaments that were burnt in the great Fire in <HI>Edinburgh. Tertio,</HI> Seeing the Terms of an Oath &s;hould be clear, that it may be taken in Truth, in Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Judgment; It is de&s;ired, That if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Abjuration Oath be re|quired of <HI>Scots-Men,</HI> the Words may be made plain and clear with|out reference to <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Statutes, which are not known here, and that what the Taker of the &s;aid Oath is to be obliged to, be expre&s;ly in&s;ert in the &s;aid Oath, and that the &s;ame be agreeable to our known Prin|ciples. <HI>Quarto,</HI> Seeing upon the event of an Union there ought to be a Commuication of all Privileges and Advantages which do or may belong to the Subjects of either Kingdom: It is intreated, That due Provi&s;ion be made, that in ca&s;e of any &V;nion <HI>Scots-Men</HI> may be capa|ble of places of Power and Tru&s;t in all places of <HI>Britain,</HI> without any Obligation to take the <HI>Engli&s;h Sacramental</HI> TEST; for that, be&s;ides what may be &s;aid of the Danger that way to prophane that Holy Ordi|nance, it may prove a Temptation to divers to conform, who other|ways would not do it, and this way by degrees bring in Corruption to this Church. <HI>Quinto,</HI> Seeing the Ecce&s;ia&s;tical Supremacy claimed &s;ome time by the Sovereigns in this Land, was &s;uch an Encroachment on the Prerogative of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, the alone Head and King of His Church, and had &s;uch &s;ad Con&s;equences, and is now &s;o happily re&s;cinded: It is humbly intreated, that all po&s;&s;ible Security be provided again&s;t the rea&s;&s;uming of it in after time.</P>

<P>It is likewi&s;e contrary to the Honour and true Intere&s;t of Her Maje&s;ty and the Monarchy, to &s;uppre&s;s the E&s;tate of Peers, who have formerly been the great Supporters of the Monarchy.</P>

<P>In the next place, each Shire and Royal Burgh within this Kingdom have the Number of their Repre&s;entatives determined by Acts of Parlia|ment, who&s;e Number at pre&s;ent being 155, are by this Article of the Treaty, reduced to 45, and to be joyned to 513 Members in the Hou&s;e of Commons, where they can have no Influence, by rea&s;on of the va&s;t Di&s;|proportion of their Numbers, be&s;ides, that the Barons and Burrows of this Nation, by this way of Uniting, are deprived of their inherent Right of being fully and individually repre&s;ented in Parliament, both with relation to their legi&s;lative and judicative Capacities.</P>
<P>And they are not only highly prejudged in le&s;&s;ening their Repre&s;enta|tion, but al&s;o degraded from being Members of the Parliaments of this Kingdom, where they &s;it as Judges in all Cau&s;es Civil and Criminal, to be joyned to the Commons of another Nation, who are accu&s;tomed to &s;up|plicate for Ju&s;tice at the Bar of the Hou&s;e of Lords.</P>

<P>And further, for the pre&s;ent Repre&s;entatives of the Barons and Bur|ge&s;&s;es to offer, by any Vote or Deed of theirs, to incapacitate their Con&s;tituents, or deprive them of any part of their inherent Right, is what their Con&s;tituents may and do ju&s;tly di&s;&s;allow, they only having their Commi&s;&s;ions with the ordinary Powers of making and amending Laws, and giving Supplys, but no ways to alter Fundamental Con&s;titu|tions, or to take away or dimini&s;h their Repre&s;entation, which is al&s;o a plain Forfeiture of their Con&s;tituents of their inherent Rights and undoubt|ed Privileges, and is contrary to the fundamental Laws of this Nation, which are the Birth-right of the People thereof.</P>
<P>From all which it is plain and evident, That this, from a Sovereign In|dependent Monarchy, &s;hall di&s;&s;olve its Con&s;titution, and be at the di&s;po|&s;al of <HI>England,</HI> who&s;e Con&s;titution is not in the lea&s;t to be altered by this Treaty, and where it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;hall have any weight in the making of Laws, even tho' relative to their own Kingdom, by rea|&s;on of the va&s;t Di&s;proportion and Di&s;parity of the Repre&s;entation afore|&s;aid.</P>
<P>And therefore I do al&s;o Prote&s;t, that no Vote may hinder or prejudge the Noblemen, Barons and Burge&s;&s;es, as now repre&s;ented in Parliament, to Retain, Bruik, Enjoy and Exerce all their Rights, Liberties and Privi|leges, as fully and freely as hitherto they have enjoyed them.</P>
<P>And &s;ince it evidently appears, not only from the many Prote&s;ts of the Honourable and Worthy Members of this Hou&s;e, but al&s;o from the Multi|tudes of Addre&s;&s;es and Petitions, from the &s;everal Parts of this Kingdom, of the Barons, Free-holders, Heretors, Burge&s;&s;es and Commons, and from the Commi&s;&s;ion of the General A&s;&s;embly, that there is a general Di&s;like and Aver&s;ion from the Incorporating Union, as contained in the&s;e Articles; And that there is not one Addre&s;s, from any part of the King|dom, in favours of this Union.</P>
<P>I do therefore further prote&s;t again&s;t concluding this and the following
<PB N="72" REF="671">
Articles of this Treaty, until HerMaje&s;ty &s;hall be fully informed of the In clinations of the People; That if HerMaje&s;ty think fit, She may call a new Parliament to have immediate Sentiments of the Union &s;ince the Articles have been made publick, where it's hoped they may fall on &s;uch Methods as may allay the Ferment of the Nation, &s;atisfie the Minds of the People, and create a full Under&s;tanding betwixt the two Kingdoms, by an Union upon honourable, ju&s;t and equal Terms, which may unite them in Affecti|on and Intere&s;t, the &s;ure&s;t Foundation of Peace and Tranquility for both Kingdoms: And this my Prote&s;tation I de&s;ire may be received, and in&s;ert in the Minutes, and recorded in the Books of Parliament, as a Te&s;timony of my Di&s;a&s;&s;ent, and the Di&s;a&s;&s;ent of &s;uch as adhere to me.</P></Q></P>

<HEAD>The Humble ADDRESS of the <HI>Scots</HI> Merchants at <HI>London,</HI> to the Right Honourable the Lords Spiritual and Tem|poral A&s;&s;embled in Parliament, again&s;t Pa&s;&s;ing the Bill, for laying Duties upon Goods which may be brought by Her Maje&s;ties Subjects, from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England</HI> af|ter the Commencement of the UNION.</HEAD>
<P>BY the Articles of UNION mo&s;t &s;olemnly ratified in <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>En|gland,</HI> It is expre&s;ly declar'd, That from and after the fir&s;t of <HI>May</HI> 1707, the two Kingdoms &s;hall be United into one, called <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and that all the Subjects of either Kingdom, &s;hall have full Free|dom and Intercour&s;e of Trade and Navigation, to and from any Port or Place within the &s;aid united Kingdom; and that there &s;hall be a Communi|cation of all other Rights, Privileges and Advantages, which do or may belong to the Subjects of either Kingdom:</P>
<P>It is humbly conceived, that the Bill now before your Lord&s;hips, is direct|ly contrary to the&s;e Articles of Union; for nothing can be a greater hin|derance to the Freedom and Intercour&s;e of Trade, than the laying &s;uch high Duties on Goods brought from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> as are by this Bill in|tended to be impos'd on Her Maje&s;ty's <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Subjects, and the <HI>Scots</HI> re|&s;iding here, whereby they are deprived of their ju&s;t Right of bringing Goods from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England</HI> by <HI>Tran&s;ire</HI> Duty free, which is plainly granted to them by the fourth Article of Union, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Exception in this Bill pretended to be in favour of the Natives of <HI>Scotland</HI> re&s;iding there, de&s;troys their Privileges al&s;o; becau&s;e it only al|lows them to bring &s;uch Goods Duty free into <HI>England</HI> after the Union com|mences, as have been before that time laden beyond Seas, and imported into <HI>Scotland</HI> on their own Accounts, but not to bring any &s;uch as they have bought, or may buy at their own Markets, whereby this Retro&s;pect Bill will &s;top the Circulation of Trade, and entail Ruin on all the Tra|ders
<PB N="80" REF="679">
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by confining &s;uch Quantities of Goods to that part of <HI>Great Britain</HI> as will exceed the Con&s;umption thereof.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> being al&s;o hinder'd by this Bill from bringing Duty free unto <HI>England,</HI> Goods Imported into <HI>Scotland</HI> before the fir&s;t of <HI>May,</HI> where|of they have not been the &s;ole Proprietors, from the time they were fir&s;t Shipp'd off beyond Seas for <HI>Scotland,</HI> until brought into <HI>England;</HI> they will be prevented from bringing their own Parts of any Goods, wherein the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had any &s;hare at the time of Importation into <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>And a particular Hard&s;hip to the <HI>Scots,</HI> the Bill impo&s;es on them the un&s;upportable <HI>onus probandi,</HI> whereby they will be oblig'd to prove their &s;ole Property from the time of buying the Goods beyond Seas, to their Arrival in <HI>England,</HI> in order whereto their Factors, Mariners, Coopers, Ware-hou&s;e-keepers, Porters, and a great number of other Servants mu&s;t be all produced together at the Exchequer Bar, and all maintain'd during their Voyages and Journeys, and Abode in <HI>London;</HI> &s;o that the Evidence nece&s;&s;ary on this occa&s;ion will co&s;t at lea&s;t 300 <HI>l. Sterling</HI> for each parcel of Goods, be&s;ides all the Delay and Vexation of a tedious Cour&s;e of Law, and the &s;evere Penalties in ca&s;e they &s;hould, by one Neglect or Misfor|tune, fail in the lea&s;t Particular of an ab&s;olute Proof.</P>
<P>This Bill will not an&s;wer the propos'd End of advancing Her Maje&s;ties Revenues, but &s;eems to be founded on mi&s;taken Notions of Trade, &s;ince after the Union commences, the Di&s;advantages, or Conveniencies to <HI>Great Britain</HI> will be equal, whether the Goods then in <HI>Scotland</HI> remain, and be con&s;um'd in that, or any other part of the United Kingdom.</P>
<P>The Allowances granted in &s;ome Articles of the Union, whereby the Re|gulation of minute Circum&s;tances is left to the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> &s;eems to be an unan&s;werable Argument, that where no &s;uch Li|berty is given, even the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> was not intended to have the Power of making any Alterations or Regulations; and as the la&s;t Article of the Union confirms the whole by repealing all Laws in either Kingdom, which are contrary to the Articles, This Bill, if it &s;hould pa&s;s into an act, and all other Laws being incon&s;i&s;tent with the Articles, of any of them, will, as it's humbly conceived, be void after the Fir&s;t of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>This Bill differs little from the former &s;ent up to your Lord&s;hips la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion, which your Lord&s;hips did not then think fit to pa&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Therefore it's hop'd that your Lord&s;hips will not pa&s;s this Bill, being, as is humbly conceiv'd, more injurious than the former, and which can only &s;erve to advance Di&s;tinctions and Animo&s;ities between the Subjects of</HI> Scotland <HI>and</HI> England, <HI>and prevent that Union of Hearts, which Her Maie&s;ty &s;o graciou&s;ly recommended from the Throne.</HI></P>

<HEAD>N^o E 3. OBSERVATIONS UPON THE Fourth Article of UNION.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. EQuity and Rea&s;on places the Subjects of the &s;ame Kingdom on equal Foot, when they are Cemented together in Affection, Laws, Trade, and Intere&s;t, this will be the Ca&s;e after the Union, when Agreements on each &s;ide are fulfilled; but when <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> were &s;eparate, they who &s;ubmitted, propo&s;ed the Terms, and Equiva|lents of an Union; and when the&s;e are granted, and agreed, &s;hould be honourably maintained, with the greate&s;t Nicety, and favourable Inter|pretation to the Weake&s;t. The Reputation of <HI>England</HI> abroad, is found|ed on the Stability of their Treaties, ss much as on the Strength of their Arms, Trea&s;ure, or Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>With the &s;ame Strength of Rea&s;on and Equity, may the <HI>Scots</HI> de&s;ire that <HI>Engli&s;h-</HI>Men, &s;ince <HI>February</HI> la&s;t, &s;hould be &s;ubject to the <HI>Onus Probandi,</HI> for Goods in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, imported by Foreigners, or for Account of Foreigners under Covert.</P>
<P>By the &s;ame Rule of Rea&s;on, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> require an Augmentation of Duties on Goods imported into <HI>England,</HI> may the <HI>Scots</HI> de&s;ire that Goods in <HI>England</HI> &s;hould be Taxed with <HI>Scots</HI> Duties, and then both King|doms would be on equal Terms.</P>
<P>The E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Union, was a Communicatory Contract, a|greed and fixt, by Per&s;ons equal in Knowledge, and Freedom of Will; the Matter in Debate was Propo&s;ed, Argued, and Covenanted, afterwards Confirmed in the mo&s;t Solemn and Authentick Manner, by the Parlia|ments of both Kingdoms, and cannot now legally, and in a decent or friendly Manner, be touched or amended in any oint, but by the Parli|ament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> who are the competent Judges of the Rights, Pri|vileges, and Conveniencies of the United Kingdoms, when the general Good, Safety and Intere&s;t of the whole, will, with it's natural Weight, &s;way the Ballance of Equity, when <HI>England</HI> will have no Rea&s;on to repine at any accidental Advantage, which <HI>Scotland</HI> may get by the Union, at it's Commencement, &s;ince it will not only enable, but encourage that Part of the United Kingdom, to undergo with Chearfulne&s;s their future Re&s;trictions, and Taxes.</P>
<P N="2">II. To the Second Rea&s;on the An&s;wer is plainly obvious, that the Sixth, Seventh, Fifteenth, and Eighteenth Articles of the Union, were con&s;ented to by <HI>Scotland,</HI> in Con&s;ideration of an Equivalent, and the Sen&s;e of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, on the Point of Cu&s;toms, is more fully explained in the Fourteenth Article of Union, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q REND="inline">'That the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hall not be charged with any Duties laid on by the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> before the Union, except the&s;e con&s;ented to in this Treaty.</Q></P>
<P>Certainly the <HI>Scots</HI> never expected, that in the Interval between the Ratification of the Articles, and the Commencement of the Union, the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> would have laid the <HI>Onus Probandi</HI> upon the
<PB N="82" REF="681">
Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and for a time &s;o far backward, nor that a greater Proof for the Property of Goods, &s;hould be required from the Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> than what is &s;tipulated for ju&s;tifying their Intere&s;t in Shipping, by the Fifth Article of Union, by which they are free from all perplex|ing Tryals at the Exchequer Barr, and are treated therein as Friends, and Men of Probity, by referring the Proof of their Intere&s;t, to their proper Oath, to be taken in the Port next to the abode of the Owner; this &s;hows that the <HI>Scots</HI> never would have con&s;ented to undergo the <HI>Onus probandi</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> for any Goods in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, belonging to them, at or before the Union.</P>
<P>It was ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to attain this Union, without a free Com|munication of Trade; and in Con&s;equence, as ab&s;olutely Impo&s;&s;ible to hinder the <HI>Scots</HI> from Trading; as <HI>Scot&s;-men,</HI> in their own Kingdom, until the Union commences; or from trading afterwards, as <HI>Britains,</HI> when the Union takes place. To deny them the fir&s;t Privilege, is to take a|way their Birth-right; and to debar them from the latter Advantage, would be a grievous Detriment, and a &s;en&s;ible Injury; becau&s;e it touch|es their Property at pre&s;ent, and weakens their Hopes of Advantage in fu|ture by the Union: At lea&s;t it will make them think their Title preca|rious and uncertain.</P>
<P>After the fir&s;t of <HI>May</HI> 1707, when the Union is to commence, the Goods then brought from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>vice ver&s;a</HI> can't in any Sen&s;e be &s;aid to be either Exported or Imported; &s;eeing, whether by Land or Water, they will only be carried from one place to another, within the &s;ame Kingdom: And therefore this Matter can no ways be comprehen|ded under the Sixth Article.</P>
<P N="3">III. To the Third Rea&s;on, That the fair Traders of <HI>England</HI> will be great Sufferers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It may be an&s;wer'd, That a certain &s;ort of fair Tra|ders, commonly di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the Character of well-meaning F&mdash;s, are greater Sufferers daily, by the cunning Contrivances of Stock-Jobbers, and other over-reaching Practices in Commerce, they would not cen&s;ure a Man, who can take up Money at 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI> from private Per&s;ons, and at the &s;ame time can lend it to the Government at 8 <HI>per Cent.</HI> If by the fair Traders, be meant the Wine Merchants or Vintners, tho&s;e who know their Method of Management, will admire how they have gain'd this Character: Allowing it, however, to them for once, in Complai&s;ance, their Damage will be as &s;oon forgot, as the Lo&s;s of a Ship is on the Exchange; and their Lo&s;s will be recompen&s;ed by a publick Advantage, which hap|pens but once, and will be of very &s;hort Continuance. The Nobility and Gentry of <HI>England</HI> may drink the Queens Health, and Pro&s;perity to the Union, in a Gla&s;s of Claret, at 2 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d. per</HI> Quart; on which the be&s;t of the Nation &s;aves 2 <HI>s.</HI> &s;eeing the Vintner &s;ells his mixt Liquor at 4 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> The <HI>Scots</HI> Merchant or Importer from <HI>Scotland</HI> cannot gain nor &s;ave by his Sale, one fourth part of what the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation does; and the Pro|portion will hold the &s;ame, upon whatever Quantities of Goods are Im|ported from <HI>Scotland,</HI> if it were po&s;&s;ible, to the value of a Million of Mo|ney. The Nation of <HI>England,</HI> in this Time of Jubilee, will be by far the greate&s;t Gainer. If the &s;ole Profit redounds wholly to the <HI>Scots</HI> Mer|chants, or to the Importers from <HI>Scotland,</HI> then the Price of Goods will be kept at their pre&s;ent Height, and the fair Traders of <HI>England</HI> cannot lo&s;e by the Stocks of Goods now on their Hands.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That the Revenue of the Cu&s;toms will be very much dimini&s;hed, may be an&s;wered, That this is not a real lo&s;s, but accidental and ima|ginary: For without the Union and Freedom of Commerce, tho&s;e Goods
<PB N="83" REF="682">
would not have been imported; and I am per&s;waded, the Queen would rather lo&s;e the Value of the Goods imported, than &s;uffer the Foundation of the Union to be undermined, or Her Subjects in <HI>Scotland</HI> to undergo Hard&s;hips, from which, in virtue of this Union, they may &s;o rea&s;onably expect an Exemption. And I believe, all Her Maje&s;ties Friends, and Well-wi&s;hers to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> will cordially prai&s;e Her Sentiments, and readily concur in &s;u&s;pecting the A&s;&s;ertions of &s;ome Gentlemen, as to the Quantities of Goods expected from <HI>Scotland.</HI> The&s;e very Per&s;ons would not be afraid of finding Money, in a Days time, to purcha&s;e the whole at prime Co&s;t, and to put them&s;elves in place of the <HI>Scots:</HI> Then they would cry up the Union as &s;acred, as the firme&s;t Foundation of our Con|&s;titution, and would &s;everely cen&s;ure the lea&s;t Encroachment.</P>
<P N="5">V. To the Fifth and mo&s;t important Rea&s;on, The Promoters of the Bill are great Men in their way, but in Compari&s;on with <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> like two Drops of Water to the Ocean; and in their greate&s;t Splendour are only valuable &s;o far, as they are u&s;eful to the Common Good; it's humbly conceiv'd, every prudent Man will conclude, it's better to let a few Men grumble, than to di&s;gu&s;t a Kingdom, and the be&s;t of Queens, by endangering the Con&s;titution of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>

<P><Q REND="inline"><P>THE Commi&s;&s;ioners being met at <HI>We&s;tminster,</HI> the chief Things debat|ed on were, 1. Whether the two Kingdoms &s;hould be united un|der the Name of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> And 2. Whether both Nations &s;hould be equally capable of Honours and Offices in either Kingdom. Some advanc'd again&s;t the Fir&s;t, That it was without all Example, that two Kingdoms equally &s;upreme, &s;hould lay a&s;ide their former Names for a third new One: Nor could the Name of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> be &s;o Honour|able as the &s;everal Names and Pluralities of Kingdoms: Thus tho <HI>Ca&s;tile, Leon</HI> and <HI>Arragon,</HI> be united under the Subjection of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Navarr</HI> under the <HI>French;</HI> yet the&s;e Kings alwi&s;e in their De&s;ignations mention the &s;everal Kingdoms they command.</P>
<P>Others alledg'd this ruight prejudice the Precedency of the Kings of <HI>England</HI> among other Princes; as being but a new one. But for all that, we find in Hi&s;tory, that this is no new thing; and in particular <HI>Livy</HI> reports, That the <HI>Trojans</HI> and <HI>Aborigines</HI> did after the Union of their Nations a&s;|&s;ume the common Name of <HI>Latines:</HI> Thus the <HI>Hungarians</HI> derived their Name from the <HI>Huni &amp; Avari (Morden in his Geography mentions the Au|thors from whence we have it)</HI> The <HI>Catalonians</HI> from the <HI>Catti &amp; Albani:</HI> The Counties in <HI>Germany</HI> u&s;e that common Name: And that only is called <HI>Feudum novum</HI> which is acquired by Money, Donation or Conque&s;t, and that <HI>Feudum antiquum</HI> which de&s;cends by Blood and Succe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>When the 2<HI>d</HI> que&s;tion came under debate, &s;ome of the Commi&s;&s;ioners agreed, it was unrea&s;onable the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;hould be admitted to, and made capable of all the Employments in <HI>England.</HI> To this it was an&s;wered, That to refu&s;e it would continue the ancient Grudge and Enmity, for the <HI>Romans</HI> were ne|ver engaged in a &s;harper War, than in the <HI>Bellum &s;ociale,</HI> which the <HI>La|tines</HI> rai&s;ed again&s;t them, becau&s;e they would not admit them to be Con|&s;uls after they were united, (<HI>vide Livy, Plutarch, Florus,</HI> &amp;c.) After which the <HI>Romans</HI> did by their own Law Declare, That <HI>inter Concives &amp; Muni|cipes, omnia munera debent e&s;&s;e communicata. Municipes enim &s;unt qui pari|ter minera publica &s;u&s;cipiunt.</HI> And <HI>Polybins</HI> in <HI>Lib.</HI> 2. &s;peaking of the Method whereby the <HI>Achaeans</HI> e&s;tabli&s;h'd their happy Union, (read al&s;o <HI>Plutarch</HI>) ob&s;erves it to have been by this means.</P>
<P>This Privilege has been allowed the <HI>Scots</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> for the Earl of <HI>Bu|chan</HI> was made Con&s;table by <HI>Ch.</HI> the 7th, becau&s;e he defeated the Duke of <HI>Charence: Dougla&s;s</HI> was made Duke of <HI>Turaine; Aubigney Vice Roy</HI> of <HI>Naples.</HI> Count <HI>Le&s;ly</HI> was preferred lately to be an Earl of the <HI>Empire,</HI> and &s;till in the Emperial Dyets. In <HI>England William</HI> of <HI>Malmsbury</HI> confe&s;&s;es three <HI>Scots-Men</HI> were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively created Arch-Bi&s;hops of <HI>Tork,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Forth</HI> was in the late Wars the &s;ucce&s;sful General of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army.</P>
<P>King <HI>James</HI> thought this Debate encroach'd upon his Prerogative, and therefore de&s;ired it might go no further; That tho by his Prerogative he might imploy Natives of either Kingdom as he plea&s;ed, yet he would pre|fer the Subjects of the re&s;pective Kingdoms in their native Countries, till mutual Education and a la&s;ting Union had fitted them to be indifferently employ'd, upon which A&s;&s;urance all the Commi&s;&s;ioners re&s;ted, and &s;o they proceeded to put the&s;e Conclu&s;ions in Form, and the Articles agreed upon were the&s;e.</P>
<P>It is agreed by the Commi&s;&s;ioners of <HI>E.</HI> and S. to be mutually propo&s;ed to the Parliaments of both Realms at the next Se&s;&s;ion, that all
<PB N="105" REF="704">
Ho&s;tile Laws made and conceived expre&s;ly, either by <HI>E.</HI> again&s;t <HI>S.</HI> or <HI>S.</HI> again&s;t <HI>E.</HI> &s;hall in the next Se&s;&s;ions be abrogated, and utterly extingui&s;h|ed.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o agreed, That all Laws, Cu&s;toms and Treaties of the Border betwixt <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hall be declared by a general Act to be abrogated and obliterated: And that the Subjects on either Part &s;hall be governed by the Laws and Statutes of the Kingdoms where they dwell, and the Name of the <HI>Borders</HI> extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e by aboli&s;hing the Border-Laws and Cu&s;toms, it may be doubted, that the Executions &s;hall cea&s;e upon the&s;e Sentences that have heretofore been given by the oppo&s;ite Officers of tho&s;e Borders, upon Wrongs committed before the Death of the late Queen of happy Memo|ry; It is therefore thought fit, That in ca&s;e the Commi&s;&s;ioners or Officers to be appointed by His Maje&s;ty before the time of the next Se&s;&s;ions of Par|liament, &s;hall not procure &s;ufficient Redre&s;s of &s;uch fyled Bills &amp; Sentences, that then the &s;aid Parliament may be moved to take &s;uch Order, as to their Wi&s;doms &s;hall &s;eem convenient in &s;atisfaction of that which has been decerned by &s;ome Officers. As al&s;o, how Di&s;orders and In&s;olencies may be hereafter repre&s;&s;ed, and the Country which was lately of the Borders kept in Peace and Quietne&s;s in time to come; As likewi&s;e to pre&s;cribe &s;ome Orders how the Pur&s;uits of former Wrongs preceeding the Death of the late Queen, and &s;ince the la&s;t Treaty of the Borders in the years 1596, and 1597, which have never as yet been moved, may be continued, and pro|&s;ecuted to a definitive Sentence.</P>
<P>And fora&s;much as the next Degree to the Abolition of all Memory of Ho&s;tility, is the Participation of mutual Commodities and Commerce; It is agreed Fir&s;t, concerning Importation of Merchandize into either Re|alm from Foreign Parts; That whereas certain Commodities are wholly prohibited by the &s;everal Laws of both Realms to be brought into either of them by the Natives them&s;elves, or by any other, the &s;aid Prohibitions &s;hall now be made mutual to both, and neither an <HI>Engli&s;h-man</HI> bring into <HI>Scotland,</HI> or a <HI>Scot&s;-man</HI> into <HI>England</HI> any of the&s;e prohibited Wares and Commodities: Neverthele&s;s if the &s;aid Commodities be made in <HI>Scotland,</HI> it &s;hall be lawful to bring them out of <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> and &s;o recipro|cally of the Commodities made in <HI>England</HI> and carried to <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Whereas a doubt hath been conceived again&s;t the equal Communication of Trade betwixt the <HI>Engli&s;h &amp; Scots</HI> Subjects in the matter of Importation, grounded upon &s;ome Inequality of Privileges, which the <HI>Scots</HI> are report|ed to have in Foreign Parts, and namely in <HI>France,</HI> above the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> whereby the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> might be prejudged: And that after a deliberate Con|&s;ideration had of the &s;uppo&s;ed Inequalities, both private and publick Exa|mination of divers Merchants of either &s;ide, touching all Liberties, Pri|vileges, Immunities, Impo&s;ts and Payments on the part of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and on the part of the <HI>Scots,</HI> either at <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> for their Trade of Wines, or in <HI>Normandy</HI> or any other parts of <HI>France</HI> for other Commodities, it appear|ed that in the Trade of <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> there was &amp; is &s;o little difference in any advantage of Privileges or Immunities, or in the Impo&s;ts and Payments, all being reckoned and well weighed on either &s;ide, as it could not ju&s;tly hinder the Communication of Trade. In the Trade of <HI>Normandy</HI> likewi&s;e, or any other Parts of <HI>France,</HI> the advantage the <HI>Scots</HI> Subjects by their Privileges are acknowledged to have, is &s;uch as without much Difficulty may be reconciled and reduced to an Equality with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> by &s;uch means as are hereafter declared. It is agreed that the <HI>Scot&s;-men</HI> &s;hall be
<PB N="106" REF="705">
free for tran&s;porting of Wine from <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> paying the &s;ame Cu&s;toms &amp; Duties that the <HI>Engli&s;h-men</HI> do pay, &amp; the <HI>Engli&s;h-men</HI> likewi&s;e &s;hall be free for tran&s;porting Wine &amp; other Commodities from <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> to <HI>Scotland</HI> paying the &s;ame cu&s;toms &amp; duties that the <HI>Scots-men</HI> do pay there.</P>
<P>And likewi&s;e for clearing and re&s;olving the Doubts touching the Ad|vantage that the&s;e <HI>Scots</HI> are &s;uppo&s;ed to have above the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in Buying and tran&s;porting the Commodities of <HI>Normandy</HI> and other parts of the King|dom of <HI>France,</HI> excepting the buying of Wine in <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> which is al|ready determined. It is agreed, that there &s;hall be &s;ent &s;ome meet and di&s;creet Per&s;ons into <HI>France,</HI> two for either &s;ide, to take notice of any &s;uch Advantage, as either the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have above the <HI>Scots,</HI> or the <HI>Scots</HI> above the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> in Buying or Tran&s;porting of any Commodities of <HI>Normandy,</HI> or any parts of <HI>France,</HI> excepting the Wine of <HI>Bourdeaux:</HI> And as the &s;aid Per&s;ons &s;hall find the advantage to be, &s;o for making the Trade e|qual, the Cu&s;toms &s;hall be advanced to the King in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland;</HI> And for the part of the&s;e that have the advantage, and according to the Proportion of the &s;aid Advantage, the Advancement of the Cu&s;tom to continue no longer, than the Privilege having &s;uch advan|tage &s;hall continue. And that generally for all other Trade from any Parts the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Scots</HI> Subjects, each in others Countrey, &s;hall have Liberty of Importation as freely as any of the Native Subjects them&s;elves having &s;pecial Privilege.</P>
<P>Next, Concerning Exportation, It is agreed, That all &s;uch Goods as are prohibited and forbidden to <HI>Engli&s;h-men</HI> them&s;elves to be exported out of <HI>England</HI> to any Foreign Part, the &s;ame &s;hall be unlawful for any <HI>Scot&s;-man,</HI> or any other to export to any Foreign Nation beyond Sea, under the &s;ame Penalties and Forfeitures that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are &s;ubject un|to, and reciprocally that furth of <HI>Scotland</HI> no <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man &s;hall tran&s;port to any Foreign Parts the Goods and Commodities that are pro|hibited in <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>Scots</HI> Men them&s;elves. Neverthele&s;s &s;uch Goods and Commodities and Merchandizes as are licen&s;ed to <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men to tran&s;port out of <HI>England</HI> to any Foreign Part, the &s;ame may be likewi&s;e tran&s;ported by <HI>Scots</HI> Men thither, they certifying their going into For|reign Parts, and taking a Cocquet accordingly, and paying the ordinary Cu&s;tom that <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men do pay them&s;elves at the Exportation of &s;uch Wares, the like Liberty to be for <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Native Commodities which either of the Countries do yield, and may &s;erve for the u&s;e and benefit of the other; It is agreed, That mutually there may be tran&s;ported furth of E. to S. and furth of S. to E. all &s;uch Wares as are either of the Growth or Handywork of either of the &s;aid Realms, without payment of any Impo&s;t, Cu&s;tom or Exaction; and as freely in all re&s;pects as any Wares may be tran&s;ported either in <HI>En|gland</HI> from part to part, or in <HI>Scotland</HI> from Part to Part, except &s;uch particular Sorts of Goods and Merchandizes as are hereafter mentioned, being re&s;train'd for the proper and inward u&s;e of each Countrey. And for that purpo&s;e it is declared, That both in this Communication of Bene|fit, and Participation of the native Commodities of the one Countrey with the other, there &s;hall be &s;pecially re&s;erv'd and excepted the &s;orts hereaf|ter &s;pecified; That is to &s;ay, Wooll, Sheep, Sheepfell, Cattel, Leather, Hides, and Linen-yarn, which are &s;pecially re&s;train'd within each Coun|trey, not to be tran&s;ported from one to the other; excepting al&s;o and re|&s;erving to the <HI>Scots</HI> Men their Trade of Fi&s;hing within the Lochs, Firths and Bayes, within Land, and in the Seas within 14 Miles of the Coa&s;ts of the Realm of <HI>Scotland,</HI> where neither <HI>Engli&s;h-</HI>men nor any Strangers have
<PB N="107" REF="706">
us'd to Fi&s;h; and &s;o reciprocally on the behalf of <HI>England.</HI> All which Re&s;trictions and Exceptions are not to be under&s;tood or mentioned in any &s;ort for a Mark or Note of Separation and Divi&s;ion, but only as matters of Policy and Conveniency for the &s;everal E&s;tates of each Countrey.</P>
<P>Furthermore it is agreed, That all foreign Wares to be tran&s;ported forth of <HI>Scotland</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> or out of <HI>England</HI> into <HI>Scotland,</HI> by any of the King's Subjects of either Kingdoms, having at their fir&s;t Entry once paid Cu&s;tom in either of the Kingdoms, &s;hall not pay outward Cu&s;toms therein afterwards, &s;ave only inward Cu&s;tom at the Port whereunto they &s;hall be tran&s;ported: But the Owner of the Goods, or Factor, or Ma&s;ter of the Ship &s;hall give Bond not to tran&s;port the &s;ame into any foreign Parts.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o agreed, That <HI>Scots-</HI>men &s;hall not be debarred from being A&s;|&s;ociates unto any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Company of Merchants, as Merchant-Venturers or others upon &s;uch Conditions as any <HI>Engli&s;h-</HI>man may be admitted; and &s;o reciprocally for <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> men in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>It is neverthele&s;s agreed by mutual Con&s;ent, and is &s;o to be under&s;tood, that the mutual Liberty afore&s;aid of Exportation and Trade in each part from the one to the other, &s;hall &s;erve for the inward u&s;e only of either Re|ahn; and Order taken for the re&s;training and prohibiting the Tran&s;por|tation of the &s;aid Commodities to foreign Parts, and for due Puni&s;hment of tho&s;e that &s;hall tran&s;gre&s;s in that behalf. And for the Better. A&s;&s;u|rance and Caution herein, It is agreed that every Merchant &s;o offending &s;hall forfeit his Goods, the Ships wherein the &s;aid Goods &s;hall be tran&s;|ported, confi&s;cated; the Cu&s;tomers, Searchers, and other Officers of the Cu&s;tom what&s;oever, in ca&s;e of Con&s;ent or knowledge on their part, to lo&s;e their Offices and Goods, and their Bodies to be impri&s;oned at His Maje|&s;ty's plea&s;ure. Of which E&s;cheats and Forfeitures two Parts &s;hall apper|tain to His Maje&s;ty, if the Cu&s;toms be unfarm'd, and the Third to the In|former: And if the Cu&s;toms be farmed, one Third of the Forfeiture to belong to His Maje&s;ty, a Third to the Farmer, and the other Third to the In|former. The Tryal of the Offence to be &s;ummar in either Countrey in the Exchequer Chamber; by Writ, &s;ufficient Witne&s;&s;es, or Oath of Party, or before the Ju&s;tice by Jury or A&s;&s;ize, and his Maje&s;ty's Officers in either Countrey to concur with the Complainers that in&s;i&s;t in the Pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>As al&s;o for the more Security that there &s;hall be no Tran&s;portation of &s;uch Goods, it is agreed that at the &s;hipping of all &s;uch native Com|modities there be taken by the Cu&s;tomer of the Port where the Goods or Wares are embark'd a Bond or Obligation &s;ub&s;cribed by the Owner of the Goods, and Ma&s;ter of the Ship; By the Owner if he be pre&s;ent, or by the Ma&s;ter of the Ship, or Factor, or Party that loadeth the &s;ame in ca&s;e of his ab&s;ence: Which Bond &s;hall contain a Sum of Money an&s;werable to the Value of the Goods, with condition of relieving the Party obliged, and di&s;charging him of the &s;aid Bond in ca&s;e Return be made of a due Cer|tificate to the Cu&s;tom where the Goods were laden, from any Port within <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Certificate to be &s;ub&s;cribed and &s;ealed by the Officers of the Cu&s;toms of the Port where the &s;aid Goods &s;hall arrive to be unladen: Or if there be no &s;uch Officers there, by the chief Magi|&s;trate and Town Clerk of that Harbour and Town under their Hand and Seal. And it is further agreed touching the different Fraighting of Com|modities either in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Scots</HI> Bottoms, that <HI>Engli&s;h-</HI>men and <HI>Scots</HI> men fraight and laden their Goods each in others Ships &amp; Bottoms indiffe|rently, paying only <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Scots</HI> Cu&s;tom, notwith&s;tanding any contra|ry Laws or Prohibitions. And that a Propo&s;ition be made to the Parlia|ment of <HI>England</HI> for e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;ome good Orders, for upholding and maintaining the great Fi&s;hing of <HI>England;</HI> as al&s;o that a Propo&s;ition be
<PB N="108" REF="707">
made to the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> for making of their &s;hipping more proportionable in Burthen to the &s;hipping of <HI>England,</HI> the better to &s;erve for the Equality of Trade, and a common Defence for the whole I&s;le.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e it's Requi&s;ite that the mutual Communication afore&s;aid, be not only extended to the Matter of Commerce, but to all other Benefites and Privileges of natural born Subjects; It is agreed that an Act be pro|poned to be pa&s;&s;ed in Manner following: That all the Subjects of both Re|alms born &s;ince the Decea&s;e of the late Queen, and that &s;hal be born here|after under the Obedience of His Maje&s;ty or His Royal Progeny, are by the common Laws of both Realms, and &s;hall be for ever enabled to ob|tain, &s;ucceed, inherit and po&s;&s;e&s;s all Goods, Lands and Chattels, Honours, Dignities, Offices, Liberties &amp; Privileges &amp; Benefices Eccle&s;ia&s;tick or Civil, in Parliament and all other places of the Kingdoms, and every one of the &s;ame, in all re&s;pects, and without any Exception what&s;omever, as fully and amply as the Subjects of either Realm re&s;pectively might have done, or may do in any &s;ort within the Kingdom where they are born.</P>
<P>Further, his Maje&s;ty out of his great Judgment and Providence, hath not only profe&s;&s;ed in publick and private Speech to the Nobility and Council of both Kingdoms, but hath al&s;o vouch&s;afed to be contented that for a more full Satisfaction and Comfort of all his loving Subjects, it may be compris'd in the &s;aid Act, that his Maje&s;ty meaneth not to confer any Office of the Crown, any Office of Judicature, Place, Voice or Office in Parliament of either Kingdom, upon the Subjects of the other, born be|fore the death of the late Queen, until Time and Conver&s;ation have en|creas'd and accompli&s;h'd an Union of the &s;aid Kingdoms, as well in the Hearts of all the People, and in the Conformity of Laws and Policies in the&s;e Kingdoms, as in the Knowledge and Sufficiency of particular men, who being untimely imployed in &s;uch Authorities, could no way be able, much le&s;s acceptable, to di&s;charge &s;uch Duties belonging to them. It is therefore re&s;olved by us the Commi&s;&s;ioners afore&s;aid, not only in regard of our De&s;ires and Endeavours to further a &s;peedy Conclu&s;ion of this hap|py Work intended, but al&s;o as a Te&s;timony of our Love and Thankful|ne&s;s for his gracious Promi&s;e, on who&s;e Sincerity and Benignity we build our full A&s;&s;urance, even according to the inward &s;en&s;e and feeling of our own Loyal and Hearty Affections, to obey and plea&s;e him in all things worthy the Subjects of &s;o worthy a Sovereign, that it &s;hall be de&s;ired of both the Parliaments, to be enacted by their Authority, That all the Sub|jects of both Realms, born before the Decea&s;e of the late Queen, may be ena|bled and made capable to acquire, purcha&s;e, inherit, &s;ucceed, u&s;e &amp; di&s;po&s;e of all Lands, Goods, Inheritances, Offices, Honours, Dignities Liberties, Privileges Immunities, Benefices and Preferments what&s;oever, Each Subject in either Kingdom with the &s;ame freedom and as lawfully and peaceably as the ve|ry natural and born Subjects of either Realm, where the &s;aid Rights, E&s;|tates or Profits are E&s;tabli&s;hed; Notwith&s;tanding what&s;oever Law, Sta|tute, or former Con&s;titution heretofore in Force to the contrary; Other than to acquire, po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ucceed or inherit any Office of the Crown, office of Judicatory, or any Voice, place or Office in Parliament. All which &s;hall remain free from being claim'd, held or enjoy'd by the Subjects of the one Kingdom within the other, born before the decea&s;e of the late Queen, notwith&s;tanding any Words, Sen&s;e or Interpretation of the Act, or any Cir|cum&s;tance thereupon depending, untill there be a perfect &amp; full Accompli&s;h|ment of the Union, as is de&s;ired mutually by both the Realms. In all which points of Re&s;ervation, either in Recital of the words, His Maje&s;ties &s;acred Promi&s;e, or in any Clau&s;e or Sentence, before &s;pecified, from enabling
<PB N="109" REF="708">
them to any of the fore&s;aid Places or Dignities. It hath been &amp; ever &s;hall be &s;o far from the thoughts of any of us, to pre&s;ume to alter or impair His Ma|je&s;tys Prerogative Royal (who contrariwi&s;e do with all comfort &amp; confidence depend herein, upon the gracious A&s;&s;urance which his Maje&s;ty is pleas'd to give in the Declaration of his &s;o ju&s;t and Princely Care and Favour to all his People,) as for a further laying open of our clear &amp; dutiful Inten|tions towards His Maje&s;tie in this &amp; in all things el&s;e which may concern his Prerogative: We do al&s;o herein profe&s;s &amp; declare, that We think it fit, there be in&s;erted in the Act to be proponed and pa&s;&s;ed in expre&s;s terms, a &s;ufficient Re&s;ervation of his Maje&s;ties Prerogative Royal, to denizate, enable, and prefer to &s;uch Offices, Honours, Dignities, and Benefices what&s;oever in both the &s;aid Kingdoms, and either of them, as are here|tofore excepted in the preceeding Re&s;ervation of all <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Scots</HI> Sub|jects born before the Decea&s;e of the late Queen, as freely, &s;overaignly and ab&s;olutely as any of His Maje&s;ties Royal Progenitors Kings of <HI>En|gland</HI> or <HI>Scotland,</HI> might have done at any time heretofore, and to all o|ther Intents and Purpo&s;es, in as ample manner as if no &s;uch Act had been thought of or mentioned.</P>
<P>And fora&s;much as the &s;everal Juri&s;dictions and Admini&s;trations of either Realm may be abu&s;ed by Malefactors, by their own Impunity, if they &s;hall commit any Offence in the one Realm, and afterwards remove their Per&s;ons and Abode into the other; It is agreed, that there may be &s;ome fit Cour&s;e advi&s;ed of by the Wi&s;doms of the Parliaments, for Tryal and proceeding again&s;t the Per&s;ons of Offenders remaining in the one Realm, for and concerning the Crimes and Faults committed in the other Realm. And yet neverthele&s;s that it may be lawful for the Ju&s;tice of the Realm, where the Offence is committed, to remand the Offender remaining in the other Realm, to be an&s;werable to the Ju&s;tice of the &s;ame Realm where the Fact was committed, &amp; that upon &s;uch Remand made, the Offen|der &s;hall be accordingly delivered, and all further Proceedings (if any be) in the other Realm &s;hall cea&s;e, &s;o as it may be done without pre|judice to His Maje&s;ty, or other Lords in their E&s;cheats and Forfeitures, with provi&s;ion neverthele&s;s that this be not thought nece&s;&s;ary to be made for all Criminal Offences, but in &s;pecial Ca&s;es only, as namely in the Ca&s;es of wilful Murther, fal&s;ifying of Moneys, and forging of Deeds, In&s;truments and Writings, and &s;uch other like Ca&s;es, as upon further Ad|vice in the &s;aid Parliament may be thought fit to be added.</P></Q></P>

<P>WE the Commi&s;&s;ioners of and for the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Nomi|nated, and &s;ufficiently Authorized by His Maje&s;ty, under His
<PB N="110" REF="709">
great Seal of that Kingdom; to Treat and Con&s;ult, as al&s;o to Conclude and Determine with your Lord&s;hips the Commi&s;&s;ioners nominated by His Maje&s;ty for the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> of and concerning the Freedom and Liberty of Trade, between the two Kingdoms of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> do repre&s;ent, That whereas his Maje&s;ty's Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> be under the Alledgeance of the King &s;ince the happy Succe&s;&s;ion of K. <HI>James</HI> to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> are &s;o far from being <HI>Aliens,</HI> that they are declared to have by the Law of this Kingdom all the Privileges of natural born Subjects of <HI>England.</HI> And whereas His Maje&s;ties Subjects in <HI>Scotland</HI> have enjoyed the &s;ame in all the Dominions and Plantations belonging to the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> more than 56 years without any con&s;iderable Ob|&s;truction all that time, yet &s;ince the 25 of <HI>March</HI> in the 12 year of His Ma|je&s;ties Reign, by &s;ome Acts of Parliament here in <HI>England,</HI> the King's Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> are clearly debarred from the Privilege granted to all His Maje&s;ties other Subjects; Seing by the&s;e Acts &s;everal Immunities and Privileges granted to &s;uch Ships, as do truely and without Fraud be|long only to the People of <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> Dominion of <HI>Wales,</HI> or Town of <HI>Berwick</HI> upon <HI>Tweed,</HI> and all other Ships and Ve&s;&s;els (without any Exception) with all their Goods and Merchandizes are declared to be forefaulted. Al&s;o by other Acts of Parliament &s;ince that time. Goods and Commodities of <HI>Scotland</HI> are at &s;ome times charged with a double Du|ty or Impo&s;ition above 16 times more than the Goods of the like Nature of Foreign Growth, &amp; &s;ome unu&s;ual Cu&s;toms are exacted in <HI>Northumberland</HI> &amp; <HI>Cumberland.</HI></P>
<P>In Order to the removing of all Ob&s;tructions, to the Freedom &amp; Liberty of Trade between the two Kingdoms, to the end the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> may be encouraged to trade here as formerly, and to export from the Kingdom &s;uch foreign and other Commodities as are nece&s;&s;ary for them, (which we conceive to be a great advantage to this Kingdom, the expor|ted Commodities far exceeding the&s;e imported hither) for encouraging the Shipping and Seamen of <HI>Scotland,</HI> without which Trade cannot be continued, and for preventing the Removal of the Trade of <HI>Scotland</HI> into foreign Parts, which would be very prejudicial to His Maje&s;ties Cu&s;toms in this Kingdom (as we conceive) and to the happy Union and Cor|re&s;pondence of the two Kingdoms, which we do above all things endea|vour to pre&s;erve.</P>
<P>We do begin with that which was 1<HI>&s;t</HI> in time, and indeed of the greate&s;t Importance to <HI>Scotland,</HI> an Act Intituled <HI>(An Act for the incouraging and increa&s;ing Shipping and Navigation)</HI> pa&s;&s;ed in the 12 year of His Maje|&s;ty's Reign, and Ratified, Confirmed and Enacted in the 13 year. <HI>Cap.</HI> 140 In relation to which Act, we de&s;ire 1<HI>&s;t.</HI> That as to the Trade with the Lands, I&s;lands, Plantations and Territories to His Maje&s;ty belonging, or in his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or which may thereafter belong unto, or be in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of His Maje&s;ty, His Heirs or Succe&s;&s;ors, in <HI>A&s;ia, Africa</HI> or <HI>A|merica,</HI> the &s;ame Freedom may be allowed to &s;uch Ships and Ve&s;&s;els as do truely and without Fraud belong to the People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> whereof the Ma&s;ter &amp; three 4th Parts are <HI>Scot&s;men,</HI> or other His Maje&s;ties Subjects, and fraighted only by His Maje&s;ties Subjects; as are allowed to His Maje&s;ties Subjects of <HI>Ireland,</HI> Dominion of <HI>Wales</HI> and <HI>Berwick</HI> upon <HI>Tweed.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That it be Declared, That His Maje&s;ties Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> are not meaned to be debarred by the Clau&s;e debarring Men or Per&s;ons, not born within the Alledgeance of our Sovereign Lord the King, from exerci&s;ing the Trade or Occupation of Merchants or Factors in any of the &s;aids Places.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="111" REF="710">

<P N="4">4. That all other Privileges granted by this Act to the Ships and Ve&s;|&s;els belonging truly to the Subjects of <HI>Ireland, Wales,</HI> and Town of <HI>Ber|wick</HI> upon <HI>Tweed,</HI> may be al&s;o declared to belong to the Ships or Ve&s;&s;els truly belonging to the Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and Navigated &amp; Fraighted as is afore&s;aid, under the &s;ame Re&s;trictions and Limitations alwi&s;e as by this Act laid upon the Subjects of <HI>Ireland, &amp;c.</HI> That it may be declared that the Penalties impo&s;ed upon <HI>Aliens</HI> for tran&s;porting of Goods from Ports to Ports, and all other Penalties impo&s;ed upon <HI>Aliens</HI> by this Act, that the Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> are no ways therein concerned.</P>
<P N="5">5. That whereas almo&s;t all the Ships and Ve&s;&s;els belonging to His Ma|je&s;ties Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> were during the late U&s;urpation taken, burnt or De&s;troyed, and many of the Ve&s;&s;els taken or bought &s;ince His Maje&s;ties happy Return, are foreign built; we de&s;ire that all Ve&s;&s;els taken from the Kings Enemies, and condemned as lawful Prize, may be Declared Na|turalized, as is lately done here, and that they and all &s;uch Ships as are truly in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of His Maje&s;ties Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> may be de|clared capable of free Trade here as if they had been built within His Maje&s;ties Dominions; a Li&s;t of &s;uch Ships being entred betwixt and a day to be agreed upon into the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e Books here, Provided that it &s;hall not be lawful for <HI>Scot&s;-men</HI> to trade here with any foreign built Ships to be bought hereafter, but only with &s;uch Ships as are built in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> or &s;ome other of His Maje&s;ties Dominions, and that both the Prize-Ships and other Ships now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> be navigated by 3 Parts of 4 of <HI>Scots-men,</HI> or others His Maje&s;ties Subjects, and fraighted only by His Maje&s;ties Subjects.</P>
<P N="6">6. And whereas it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, that by demanding &s;uch a Trade with the Plantations, as is allowed to the Subjects of <HI>Ireland,</HI> we may pre|judge His Maje&s;ties Cu&s;toms here, or de&s;troy the Ends of the Act of Na|vigation as to the&s;e Commodities; We Declare that we are willing to Treat and Conclude with your Lord&s;hips upon &s;uch A&s;&s;urances as can be rea&s;onably demanded, that none of the&s;e Commodities &s;hall be tran&s;port|ed by <HI>Scots</HI> Ships from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations to any place beyond the Seas, but they &s;hall be wholly brought into &s;uch Parts of <HI>England</HI> as &s;hall be agreed upon, excepting only &s;uch a very &s;mall Number, for the Con|&s;umption of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as &s;hall be agreed upon betwixt your Lord&s;hips and us.</P>

<P>WE, the Commi&s;&s;ioners, for <HI>England,</HI> do, with great Satisfaction meet your Lord&s;hips on this Occa&s;ion, hoping that by this Con|gre&s;s the great Bu&s;ine&s;s for which Her Maje&s;ty has been plea&s;ed to grant the&s;e Commi&s;&s;ions, may be happily effected. That <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scot|land</HI> already united in Alledgeance under one Head, the Queen, may for ever hereafter become one People, one in Heart and mutual Affec|tions, one in Intere&s;t, one in Name, or in Deed, a Work which if it can be brought to pa&s;s, promi&s;eth a la&s;ting Happine&s;s to us all.</P>
<P>With great Sincerity we de&s;ire this Union, and we meet your Lord|&s;hips with Hearts fully determined to enter upon &s;uch Con&s;iderations, and into &s;uch Mea&s;ures with your Lord&s;hips, as are proper for bring|ing the &s;ame to the de&s;ired Conclu&s;ion; on our part nothing &s;hall be want|ing that may conduce to a happy Period of this great Work.</P></Q></P>

<P>THE Union of the two Kingdoms has been much de&s;ired both before and &s;ince their being under one Sovereign, and I hope, it is re|&s;erved to Her Maje&s;ty for the Glory of Her Reign, to fini&s;h the de&s;ign which hath been often attempted by Her Royal Predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>My Lord, I do con&s;ider this Union to be highly advantageous for the Peace and Wealth of both Kingdoms, and a great Security for the Pro|te&s;tant Religion every-where; And, I can a&s;&s;ure your Lord&s;hips both for my &s;elf, and the other Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> that we meet your Lord&s;hips with great Regard and Honour to your Per&s;ons, and with &s;incere Intentions to advance this great De&s;ign, &amp; to accom|modate any Difficulties that may ari&s;e in the Treaty upon fair and rea|&s;onable Terms.</P></Q></P>

And then</P>
<P>The Lord Keeper offered a Paper, containing the Re&s;ult of the la&s;t Con|ference in the Propo&s;als made by the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> a|bout Trade.

<P>The Paper offered by the <HI>Scots</HI> differed only materially from this in that in the &s;econd Article, the Words (and upon the Home Con&s;umpt) were left out, and &s;o need not to be in&s;erted.</P>
<P>After reading of which, the <HI>Scots</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners withdrew, and return|ing within a little, the Duke of <HI>Queen&s;berry</HI> told their Lord&s;hips for <HI>En|gland,</HI> that they had taken notice of &s;ome things in the Paper offered by their Lord&s;hips, which did not &s;eem properly to fall under the Head of Trade, as the Duties on Home Con&s;umpt; The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in&s;i&s;ted that it did.

<HEAD>Follows the Con&s;iderations offered by the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></HEAD>
<ITEM>1. AS to the former part of the fir&s;t Article, <HI>viz.</HI> That neither Kingdom be burdened with the Debts contracted, or to be contracted by the other before the Union, it being the &s;ame <HI>in terminis</HI> with the 5th Propo&s;ition delivered by your Lord&s;hips on the 9th <HI>December;</HI> the Ob|&s;ervation made then may &s;uffice for a Reply to it now, <HI>viz.</HI> That tho the Debts of <HI>England</HI> have been contracted by a long War, entred into more particularly for the Pre&s;ervation of <HI>England,</HI> and the Dominions thereto belonging, yet <HI>Scotland</HI> has had its Share in the Benefits which
<PB N="127" REF="726">
have accrued to <HI>Great-Britain</HI> in general from the Oppo&s;ition that has been made to the Growth and Power of <HI>France,</HI> and have encrea&s;ed the Number of their Seamen con&s;iderably, by the Imployment they had in the Coa&s;t-Trade of <HI>England</HI> during the War. But as it is nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould be under equal Impo&s;itions with regard to the Ballance of Trade, and Manufactories when the Kingdoms &s;hall be united, and a free Com|munication of Native Product &s;ettled, &s;o it may be rea&s;onable that the Money &s;o rai&s;ed upon that part which is now called <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;hould be applyed to the Security and Protection of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Trade thereof; nor does it follow, That becau&s;e the Duties now rai&s;ed on particular Funds in <HI>England</HI> are appropriate for payment of Debts; That therefore when the like Duties are laid on in <HI>Scotland,</HI> they mu&s;t be applyed in the &s;ame manner, but for their Lord&s;hips to propo&s;e that there be no other Duty in <HI>Scotland</HI> than the&s;e now on Foot there, till the Debts in <HI>England</HI> con|tracted, or to be contracted before the Union be fully &s;atisfied and paid, &s;etts the pre&s;ent Trade on an equal Foot, (which is intended by an equality of Impo&s;itions) at &s;uch a di&s;tance, as gives little hopes to any now alive of coming at it, For one of the nine Pences on Beer and Ale being the Fund of the fir&s;t Million <HI>Act, Anno</HI> 4 and 5. of the late King and Queen, was granted for 99 years; One Nine Pences more (which is the Fund of the Lottery) for about eight years yet to come; One nine Pence more (which is the Bank-Fund) Inheritance to the Crown, as are al&s;o the &s;everal Duties upon Salt, and half that on Stamped Paper, tho' in the&s;e latter Duties there are Clau&s;es of Provi&s;ion for Redemption, but whil&s;t it is in&s;i&s;ted, That there &s;hall be no other nor greater in <HI>Scotland</HI> than are already paid there, it may be pre&s;umed that the&s;e already men|tioned, are enough to prevent the nece&s;&s;ity of enquiring into the Number or Proportion of what they have in <HI>Scotland,</HI> where if by Exemption from &s;uch Duties, a Clothier can &s;ub&s;i&s;t him&s;elf at 4<HI>d per diem,</HI> whereas he cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t in <HI>England</HI> under 8<HI>d per diem;</HI> Then all &s;uch Manufactu|res who &s;hall go thither; will be able to under&s;ell, and con&s;equently out|trade tho&s;e that &s;tay in <HI>England</HI> half in half in what relates to their La|bour, by &s;ub&s;i&s;ting &s;o much cheaper; But the Workman&s;hip of every pound of Wooll made in Cloth, advances the value of it near Nine Parts in Ten for its fir&s;t Co&s;t.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. As to the &s;econd Article, their Lord&s;hips &s;ay, That Duties upon the Home Con&s;umption require to be equally laid on all the parts of the U|nited Kingdoms; Nor do the Northern Counties of <HI>England</HI> pay le&s;s Duties of Exci&s;e (as &s;eems here &s;ugge&s;ted) than the Mid-land, but rather more in Proportion to the value of their Counties and Commodities ex|ci&s;ed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. As to the Third Article, it is needle&s;s to debate upon it till the fir&s;t be &s;ettled, the&s;e two depending the one upon the other; If indeed the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>England</HI> &s;hould think it expedient to exempt Home-Con&s;umption of <HI>Scotland</HI> from any new Duties for &s;ome rea&s;onable Period of Time, till that Kingdom began to reap the benefite of the free Com|munication of Trade intended by the Union, Then their Lord&s;hips will in&s;i&s;t, that &s;uch Commodities as pay Duties in <HI>England</HI> may be cleared with the &s;ame Duties when they are exported or brought out of <HI>Scotland</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> &amp; upon &s;ome other Provi&s;ions which will be requi&s;ite to pre|vent Frauds in Her Maje&s;ties Revenues.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="128" REF="727">
4. As to the 4th Article, The Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>England</HI> &s;ay, That the free Communication, e&s;pecially of the Foreign Trade, to which in the terms of the Preliminaries their Lord&s;hips have a&s;&s;ented, is &s;o great a Benefite to <HI>Scotland,</HI> that they did not expect an Equivalent &s;hould have been mentioned, for the equality of Impo&s;ition on Importation and Ex|portation; Be&s;ides, their Lord&s;hips &s;ay, your Lord&s;hips have already a|greed upon an equality of Impo&s;itions as to Foreign Trade, both as to Ex|portation and Importation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5.

<P>As to the la&s;t Propo&s;ition delivered the 27th In&s;tant, their Lord&s;hips &s;ay, It has been found by Experience, That two Companies exi&s;ting to|gether in the &s;ame Kingdom, and carrying on the &s;ame Traffick, are de|&s;tructive to Trade, and are therefore of Opinion, that to agree with this Propo&s;ition, will be incon&s;i&s;tent with the Intere&s;t of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>

<P>The Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> under&s;tand the Paper given in by their Lord&s;hips in this Sen&s;e; That neither Kingdoms &s;hall be bur|dened with the Debts of the other contracted before the Union, and that no Duties on Home Con&s;umption, or Taxes to be levyed from <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hall be applyed to the payment of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Debts, and that a Time be al|lowed to <HI>Scotland</HI> to reap the Benefite of the Communication of Trade, be|fore that Kingdom become lyable to pay other or greater Duties on Home Con&s;umption, or Inland Taxes, than tho&s;e now on Foot: And that it is mo&s;t proper to be determined by the re&s;pective Parliaments of both Kingdoms how long that Time of Exemption &s;hall &s;ub&s;i&s;t: This Paper their Lord&s;hips of <HI>England</HI> took into Con&s;ideration again&s;t next Meeting.</P>
