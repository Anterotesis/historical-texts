<HEAD>The HAPPY WATERMAN.</HEAD>
<P>A Gentleman and lady walking on the banks of the river Thames, &s;pied a &s;mall ferry boat with a neatly dre&s;&s;ed waterman rowing towards them: on his nearer ap|proach, they read on the &s;tern of his boat, these Words, THE HAPPY WATERMAN.&mdash; Without taking any notice of it, they deter|mined to enter into conversation with him, and enquiring into his &s;ituation in life, they found that he had a wife and five children, and &s;upported al&s;o an old father and mo|ther-in-law by his own labour. The gen|tleman and lady were upon this still more &s;urpri&s;ed at the title he had given him&s;elf, and &s;aid, "my friend if this is your &s;itua|tion, how is it that you call your&s;elf the hap|py waterman?" "I can ea&s;ily explain this to your &s;atisfaction," an&s;wered the young man, "if you will give me leave;" and they de&s;iring him to proceed, he &s;poke as follows: "I have ob&s;erved that our greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings in life are often looked upon as the greate&s;t distresses, and are in fact made &s;uch by means of imprudent conduct. My father and mother died a few years ago, and left
<PB N="3" REF="3">a large family; my father was a waterman, and I was his a&s;&s;i&s;tant in the management of a ferry-boat, by which he &s;upported his fa|mily; on his death, it was nece&s;&s;ary (in or|der to pay his ju&s;t debts) to &s;ell our boat! I parted from it&mdash;even with tears&mdash;but the di&s;tre&s;s that I felt &s;purred me on to indu&s;try, for I &s;aid, I will u&s;e every kind of diligence to purcha&s;e my boat back again. I went to the person who had bought it, and told him my de&s;ign: he had given five <HI>guineas</HI> for it, but told me, as I was once the owner, that I &s;hould have it when ever I could rai&s;e five <HI>pounds.</HI> "Shall the boat be mine again?" &s;aid I; my heart bounded at the thought?"</P>
<P>"I was this time married to a good young woman, and we lived in a neighbour|ing cottage; &s;he was young, healthy, and indu&s;trious, and &s;o was I, and we loved one another &mdash; What might we not under|take? my father u&s;ed to &s;ay to me, Al|ways do what is right? labour diligently and &s;pend your money carefully; and GOD will bless your &s;tore. We trea&s;ured up the&s;e rules, and determined to try the truth of them. My wife had long chiefly &s;up|ported two aged parents: I loved them as my own&mdash;and the de&s;ire of contributing to their &s;upport, was an additional &s;pur to my endeavours to re-purcha&s;e the boat. I en|tered my&s;elf as a day labourer, in the gar|den of our &s;quire: and my wife was called
<PB N="4" REF="4">occa&s;ionally to perform &s;ome &s;ervices at the hou&s;e, and employed her&s;elf in needle work, &s;pinning or knitting at home; not a moment in the day was &s;uffered to pa&s;s unemployed &mdash;we &s;pared for our&s;elves and furni&s;hed all the comforts we could to the poor about us &mdash;and every week we dropped a little over|plus into a fairing box&mdash;to buy the BOAT. If any accident or charity brought us an additional &s;hilling, we did not enlarge our expence, but kept it for the BOAT! The more care we took, the more comfortable we felt, for we were the nearer the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of our little BOAT. Our labour was lightened, by our looking forward to the attainment of our wishes. Our family in|deed increa&s;ed, but with it our friends in|crea&s;ed also, for the cleanline&s;s and frugality which furni&s;hed our cottage, and the con|tent and chearfulne&s;s that appeared in it, drew the notice of our rich neighbours; of my ma&s;ter and mir&s;te&s;s particularly, who&s;e rule was to a&s;&s;i&s;t the indu&s;trious, but not to encourage the idle. They did not approve of giving money to the poor; but in cold winters, or dead times, allowed us to buy things at a cheaper rate; this was <HI>money to us,</HI> for when we counted our little ca&s;h for the week's marketing, all that was &s;aved to us by our tickets to purcha&s;e things at re|duced prices went into our "lit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le box." If my children got a penny at &s;chool for a
<PB N="5" REF="5">reward to buy gingerbread, they brought it home, they &s;aid, to help to buy the BOAT &mdash;for they would have no gingerbread till daddy had got his boat again! Thus from time to time our little &s;tore in&s;en&s;ibly in|crea&s;ed, till one pound only was wanting of the five, when the following accident hap|pened. Coming home one evening from my work, I &s;aw in my road a &s;mall pocket|book: on opening it, I found a bank note of ten pounds, which plainly enough be|longed to my ma&s;ter, for his name was upon it, and I had al&s;o &s;een him pa&s;&s;ing that way in the evening: it being too late however to return to the house, I went on my way. When I told my family of the accident, the little ones were thrown into a tran&s;port of joy. My dears, &s;aid I, what is the matter? "Oh, daddy, the BOAT! the BOAT! we may now have two or three boats!" I check|ed them, by my looks, and a&s;ked them if they recollected who&s;e money that was? they &s;aid, "yours, as you found it." I re|minded them that I was not the real owner, and bid them think how they would all feel &s;uppo&s;ing a &s;tranger was to take our box of money if I &s;hould happen to drop it on the day I went to buy back the boat. This thought had the effect on their young minds that I de&s;ired: they were &s;i|lent, and pale with the repre&s;entation of &s;uch a di&s;a&s;ter! and I begged it might be a
<PB N="6" REF="6">le&s;&s;on to them never to forget the golden rule of "doing as they would wi&s;h others to do to them; for by attention to this certain guide, no one would ever do wrong to another. I al&s;o took the opportunity, to explain to them that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the BOAT by di&s;hone&s;t means would never an|&s;wer, &s;ince we could not expect the ble&s;&s;ing of God upon <HI>bad deeds.</HI></P>
<P>To go on with my &s;tory&mdash;the next morn|ing I put the pocket book into my bo&s;om, and went to my work, intending as &s;oon as the family ro&s;e to give it to my ma&s;ter but what were my feelings, when, on &s;earch|ing in my bosom, it was no where to be found. I ha&s;ted back, along the road I came, looking diligently all the way, but, in vain! there was no traces of any &s;uch thing&mdash;I would not return into my cot|tage becau&s;e I wi&s;hed to &s;ave my family the pain I felt, and in the hope of &s;till recovering the book, I went to my work, following ano|ther path which I al&s;o recollected I had gone by; on my return to the garden gate, I was acco&s;ted by the gardener, who, in a threaten|ing tone told me, I was &s;u&s;pected; that our ma&s;ter had lo&s;t a pocket-book, de&s;cribing what I had found, and that I being the only man ab&s;ent from the garden at the hour of work, the re&s;t of the men al&s;o denying that they had any &s;uch thing, there was every rea&s;on to conclude that I mu&s;t have got it.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="7">
Before I could an&s;wer, my di&s;t&s;&s;ed counte|nance confirmed the &s;u&s;picion! and another &s;ervant coming up, &s;aid I was detected, for that a per&s;on had been &s;ent to my hou&s;e, and that my wife and family had owned it all, and had de&s;cribed the pocket book. I told them the real fact, but it &s;eemed to every one unlikely to be true; every circum&s;tance was again&s;t me, and my heart trembles to look back upon it! I was arre&s;ted, and hur|ried away to pri&s;on! I prote&s;ted my inno|cence, but I did not wonder that I gained no credit! Great grief now oppre&s;&s;ed my heart! my poor wife, my dear children, and my gray headed parents, were all at once plunged into want and mi&s;ery, in&s;tead of the ea&s;e and happine&s;s which we were expecting; for we were ju&s;t arriving at the height of our earthly wishes! I had, however, one con|&s;olation left, that I knew <HI>I was innocent;</HI> and I tru&s;ted that by "per&s;evering in hone&s;ty," all might come right at la&s;t; My resolution was, as I had certainly been the cau&s;e, tho' without any de&s;ign of the &s;econd lo&s;s of the property, that I would offer (alas!) the whole of our little &s;tore, to make it good as far as in my power; and I &s;ent for my wife to give her this &s;ad commi&s;&s;ion, but &s;he informed me that even this &s;acrifice, could be of no avail, &s;on, &s;aid &s;he, my ma&s;ter has been at our cottage, when I told him freely how you had found the note, but unfortu|nately
<PB N="8" REF="8">had lo&s;t it again; and I added, that I was &s;ure both I and my hu&s;band would make the be&s;t return in our power, after which I produced our little fairing box, and begged him to accept the contents, which had been &s;o long rai&s;ing, as all we had to offer: But, Sir, &s;aid the Waterman, conceive my agony, when &s;he added, that my ma&s;ter angrily refu&s;ed, &s;aying that our being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all that money was of it&s;elf the cleare&s;t proof of my guilt; for it was im|po&s;&s;ible, with my large family, and no greater opportunities than my neighbours, that I could come hone&s;tly by &s;uch a &s;um; there|fore he was determined to keep me in gaol till I &s;hould pay the whole. My unhap|pine&s;s was very great; however my mind by degrees began to be more ea&s;y, for I grew confident that I &s;hould not tru&s;t in <HI>God</HI> and my own innocence in vain:&mdash;and &s;o it hap|pened, one of my fellow labourers proved to be the per&s;on who had picked up the note after I had dropped it, having come a few minutes after me along the &s;ame road to his work, and hearing that the &s;u&s;picion had fallen altogether on me, he was tempted to turn the accident to his own advantage, and conceal the property; which having kept in his own box for a few weeks, 'till he thought no &s;u&s;picion would re&s;t upon him, he went and offered the note for change
<PB N="9" REF="9">and being then &s;u&s;pected, my ma&s;ter had him taken up, and I was relea&s;ed.</P>
<P>This &s;econd change from &s;o much mi&s;ery to happine&s;s was almo&s;t too much for us: My ma&s;ter &s;ent for me, with many ex|pre&s;&s;ions of concern for what had pa&s;&s;ed, made me give him an account of the means by which I had collected the little fund, that fixed his &s;u&s;picion &s;o &s;trongly upon me! I accordingly related the hi&s;tory of it as I have now done; and when I came to that part where I checked my children for their incon&s;iderate joy on my finding the note, he ro&s;e with much kindne&s;s in his looks, and putting the bank bill into my hand, he &s;aid, "Take it!&mdash;the bank note &s;hall be theirs. It is the be&s;t and only return I can make you, as well as a ju&s;t reward of your hone&s;ty; and it will be a &s;ub&s;tantial proof to your children of the goodne&s;s of your in&s;tructions, for they will thus early &s;ee, and feel the benefit of hone&s;ty and virtue;"</P>
<P>This kind and worthy gentleman inte|re&s;ted him&s;elf much in the purcha&s;e of my boat, which, in le&s;s than a week I was in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of. The remainder of my ma&s;ter's bounty, and the additional advantage of the ferry, has placed me in comfortable circum&s;tances, which I hum|bly tru&s;t in God will continue to us as long as we continue our labour and hone&s;t dili|gence; and I can &s;ay from my long expe|rience
<PB N="10" REF="10">that the fruit of our own indu&s;try is always the &s;weete&s;t. I have now al&s;o the plea|&s;ure of being able to help others, for when a rich pa&s;&s;enger takes the ferry, as my &s;tory is well known in the neighbourhood, he often gives me more than my fare, which enables me to let the next poor per&s;on go over for half price.</P>
<P>The lady and gentleman were extremely plea&s;ed with the waterman's &s;tory, and wil|lingly joined in calling him the HAPPY WA|TERMAN. They pa&s;&s;ed over in his ferry|boat for the &s;ake of making him an hand&s;ome pre&s;ent. And from this time, becoming acquainted with his family, they did them every &s;ervice in their power, giving books and &s;chooling to their little ones, and every comfort to the old father and mother-in law as long as they &s;urvived. They were very de&s;irous of knowing what became of the unfortunate fellow labourer, who had &s;o dreadful<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y gone a&s;ide from the principles of hone&s;ty, and they learnt that he was, af|ter a &s;hort impri&s;onment, &s;et at liberty by his ma&s;ter at the earne&s;t entreaty of the ho|ne&s;t waterman, as he &s;aid it was partly thro' his carele&s;&s;ne&s;s in lo&s;ing the note, that the temptation had fallen in his fellow labour|er's way: he had moreover a very large fa|mily, his ma&s;ter al&s;o was &s;o good as to con|&s;ider that he was a man who had not been ble&s;&s;ed with a good education in his youth,
<PB N="11" REF="11">&s;o that having little fear of God before his eyes, and having a great temptation in his way, he had been the more ea&s;ily led to commit this very wicked action, by which he would have enriched him&s;elf at the ex|pence of an innocent man. I have a great plea&s;ure in adding that the thought of what he had done, together with the genero&s;ity of the waterman, had &s;o &s;trong an effect upon this poor fellow, that he afterwards had it written upon his cottage door, DO AS YOU WOULD BE DONE UNTO. And he hath re&s;olved to follow this rule him&s;elf in future, and al&s;o taught it to his children: indeed it became a rule well known over the whole pari&s;h, for every little child having been informed of this &s;tory, was told that he ought to con&s;ider before he did any action, whether he would like his brother, or &s;i&s;ter, or &s;chool fellow to do the &s;ame to him; and if not, that the action was wrong, and not to be done, let the profit be ever &s;o great. Surely then, tho&s;e who have lived long and &s;een much of life, and have had much religious in&s;truction al&s;o, &s;hould ne|ver depart from this &s;imple but certain rule. And it is the &s;ame to all ranks&mdash;it requires neither learning or abi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ities to "do as you would be done unto," nor can any &s;tation however great, no nor any circum&s;tances however trying, excu&s;e men from giving their con&s;tant attention to it.</P>
