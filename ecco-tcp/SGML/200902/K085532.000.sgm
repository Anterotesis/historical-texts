<HEAD>SUMMARY.</HEAD>
<P>UNiver&s;al belief being, in fact, an undi&s;puted criterion of truth, and all mankind nece&s;&s;arily believing tho&s;e po&s;i|tions which they conceive demon&s;trable; &s;cience, or demon&s;tra|tive knowledge, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the lea&s;t exceptionable te&s;t of what is true or fal&s;e, in general. &mdash;The ab&s;tract certitude of the &s;chools is, therefore, exploded. But, as particular opinions are not always the effect of knowledge, nor are &s;y&s;tems con|&s;tantly founded on &s;cientifick principles, it is inquired if there be no other criterion, &s;ufficiently obvious to relieve the doubts and reconcile the oppo&s;ite &s;entiments of mankind. &mdash;The di&s;pen|&s;ations of providence, as well as the dictates of revelation, ap|pear inadequate to the purpo&s;e; theologi&s;ts being found too un|&s;uccee&s;sful, in clearing up the &s;acred page, and phi&s;iologi&s;ts too ignorant of the &s;y&s;tem of nature, for either to form opinions, equally adapted to the credulity of individuals. &mdash;Divines and philo&s;ophers are cen&s;ured, indeed, rather as, mercenary wrang|lers, or bigots to particular &s;y&s;tems, than fair inquirers after, or teachers of, the truth. &mdash;A fair and ingenuous inquirer characteriz'd. &mdash;Such not frequently to be found; few being capacitated for &s;o arduous a ta&s;k. &mdash;Fortitude and moderation the grand requi&s;ites: the &s;carcity of which in the minds of men, in general, &s;erves to account for their want of &s;ucce&s;s in the attempt; as well as for their promptitude either to embrace
<PB N="4" REF="26">
&s;keptici&s;m, as an antidote to errour, or conformity, to avoid the trouble of thinking. &mdash;Dogmati&s;ts and Skepticks cen&s;ured: The former on account of their ab&s;urd dependance on tradition and futile authorities: the latter for &s;uperciliou&s;ly rejecting, on the other hand, all authority and tradition, without di&s;|tinction. &mdash;In our inquiries after truth, however, our belief is to be &s;u&s;pended in regard to points beyond our knowledge. &mdash;In &s;cientifick re&s;earches, al&s;o, the &s;ubtilty of metaphy&s;ical argu|ments &s;hould be with caution tru&s;ted, as in&s;en&s;ibly leading us into errour and perplexity.</P>

<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>On Science, as our guide to truth&mdash;The criterion be&s;t adapted to the opinion of individuals&mdash; The ab&s;urdity of per&s;ecution&mdash;Our preten|&s;ions to divine, and the bounds of human knowledge.</P>

<HEAD>SUMMARY</HEAD>
<P>SCience, though admitted as the rule of faith in matters re|lating to the inve&s;tigation of truth, is neither exclu&s;ive nor univer&s;al, affecting only our opinion in &s;peculative points. For, however refin'd are our <HI>credenda,</HI> we in&s;en&s;ibly join, in our practical notions, with the re&s;t of mankind. &mdash;Whatever objection, therefore, &s;cientifick inquirers may make to the &s;y&s;tems of others, none can be made to their fixing the criterion of truth on knowledge: the certainty of which is, by implication, ad|mitted in the general preten&s;ions of mankind to <HI>common-&s;en&s;e.</HI> &mdash;This is the privilege of ev'ry mind, without di&s;tinction; e|nabling us equally to draw like conclu&s;ions from like premi&s;es. &mdash;All actual di&s;pute, therefore, ari&s;es from &s;ome mi&s;under|&s;tanding, or different acceptation, of the matter in que&s;tion: as the mo&s;t ignorant pea&s;ant is equally certain of the proofs he comprehends with the greate&s;t philo&s;opher. &mdash;For the &s;ame rea|&s;on, neverthele&s;s, tho&s;e would be engag'd in a de&s;perate under|taking, who &s;hould attempt to reconcile mankind to any one &s;y&s;tem of opinion; the capacity and credulity of individuals being &s;o very different, in con&s;equence of their diver&s;ity of temperament, education and experience. &mdash;It is injurious and ridiculous, therefore, to in&s;ult others, for thinking in the manner we our&s;elves &s;hould have done, under the &s;ame circum|&s;tances. &mdash;It is &s;till more ab&s;urd to reprobate the re&s;t of man|kind for not believing what we our&s;elves do not, nor can po&s;|&s;ibly
<PB N="46" REF="68">
be made to, believe: as is the ca&s;e when we would im|po&s;e tenets, that either contradict them&s;elves, or are, in fact, downright non&s;en&s;e&mdash;For it is impo&s;&s;ible to believe apparent fal&s;hood, or to be convinc'd of any thing, by a &s;et of words, that convey no determinate meaning&mdash;My&s;terious or unin|telligible propo&s;itions cannot, therefore, be believ'd&mdash;If the truth of revelation, in general, be admitted, as what is re|veal'd from Heaven mu&s;t undoubtedly be true, the difficulty of knowing what is particularly &s;o, or who are the truly in|&s;pir'd, is yet inexplicably great. &mdash;Tho' the power of working miracles al&s;o be allow'd a proof of in&s;piration, in the agent; the fallacy of pretended ones, and the &s;uppos'd in&s;piration of im|po&s;tors, are almo&s;t invincible ob&s;tacles to our di&s;covery of the truth. &mdash;The &s;uppo&s;ition, al&s;o, that real miracles are tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions of the laws of nature is not at all nece&s;&s;ary to &s;up|port their veracity; but argues the contrary; and implies an in|jurious reflection on the omnipotence and pre&s;cience of the Deity. &mdash;Whatever rea&s;onable objections, however, we may have a|gain&s;t putting implicit faith in either pretended miracles or re|velation; yet as the utmo&s;t extent of &s;cientifick di&s;covery falls &s;o infinitely &s;hort of a perfect knowledge of the de&s;igns and opera|tions of Nature; we cannot philo&s;ophically deny that God &s;ometimes produces effects, for ends be&s;t known to him&s;elf, by means wholly unknown to us. &mdash;To proceed, neverthele&s;s, in our inquiries on the mo&s;t certain grounds, the criterion of Science is to be neglected only in points indi&s;putably and intelligibly re|veal'd.</P>

<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>On the weakne&s;s of the human under&s;tanding. &mdash;The ab&s;tract exi&s;tence of the Deity. &mdash;The incomprehen&s;ibility of the divine nature, and the incongruity of pretended athei&s;m.</P>

<HEAD>SUMMARY.</HEAD>
<P>AS it is nece&s;&s;ary to our &s;ucce&s;s in &s;cientifick re&s;ear|ches that the mind &s;hould be dive&s;ted of its prejudices, in favour of tradition and cu&s;tom; &s;o, however exten&s;ive be the freedom of enquiry, it is equally nece&s;&s;ary that the object of inve&s;tigation be adapted to the limits of the under|&s;tanding: mankind always falling into errour and confu&s;ion, in their attempts to di&s;cover the knowledge of things beyond their capacity. However true, therefore, may be many of our di&s;|coveries in the &s;y&s;tem of Nature; <HI>God,</HI> the authour of that &s;y&s;tem, is ab&s;tracted from it and above our comprehen&s;ion. &mdash; Hence our preten&s;ions to de&s;cribe, or define, the <HI>Deity,</HI> are palpably ab&s;urd and ridiculous. For, tho' a created Being may a&s;cribe to its creator the mo&s;t re&s;pectable of all known perfections, yet, as all its ideas of perfection are relative to it&s;elf, the attributes human beings a&s;cribe to God are nece&s;&s;a|rily the &s;uperior qualities of <HI>humanity.</HI> &mdash;Notwith&s;tanding, however, the Deity is &s;o far removed from our enquiries, and thereby confe&s;&s;edly no object of philo&s;ophical knowledge, yet the actual di&s;belief of the exi&s;tence of a God is denied: the argu|ments for and again&s;t athei&s;ts compo&s;ing, in fact, a very ridiculous di&s;pute: as the impo&s;&s;ibility of denying the being of a <HI>fir&s;t cau&s;e</HI> is evident; and the re&s;t of the controver&s;y a mere cavil about words, of no determinate meaning.</P>

<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>On happine&s;s. &mdash;The apparent incapacity of mankind for its enjoyment. &mdash;The compara|tive pain and plea&s;ure of human &s;en&s;ations; and their relation to our phy&s;ical and moral con&s;titution.</P>

<HEAD>SUMMARY.</HEAD>
<P>NEXT to the ab&s;urdity of puzzling our&s;elves in the in|ve&s;tigation of matters beyond our capacity, and equally an ob&s;tacle to our inquiries after truth, is the folly of our con|&s;tant pur&s;uit, and in &s;pite of as con&s;tant di&s;appointments, our expectations of <HI>happine&s;s</HI>&mdash;The term is certainly left vague and ill-defin'd even by tho&s;e philo&s;ophers who, pretending it to be attainable, affect to teach us how happine&s;s may be acquir'd&mdash;Its meaning is, neverthele&s;s, obvious; and is determined from the tenour of its acceptation with the generality of man|kind. In which &s;en&s;e, it is &s;hown to be hitherto unattain'd; and that, not only from the impo&s;&s;ibility of <HI>externals</HI> to confer happine&s;s, but, from the evident incapacity of human beings to be made happy&mdash;It is hence, al&s;o, declar'd unattainable; and even the mo&s;t laudable means whereby it is pur&s;ued, as tho&s;e of knowledge, religion, and virtue are experimentally, and logically, &s;hown to be incapable of conferring happine&s;s. &mdash;In fact, ev'ry &s;tate, age and condition of life having its &s;eve|ral di&s;tinct anxieties and con&s;olations, it appears that a conti|nued &s;en&s;e of either happine&s;s or mi&s;ery is incompatible with our nature; as well as with the very e&s;&s;ence of plea&s;ure and pain in general: our &s;en&s;ations of both which are merely compara|tive and reciprocally nece&s;&s;ary to that of each other. Whence happine&s;s and mi&s;ery are evidently relative to, and dependant on, the con&s;titution of the human frame; with which ab&s;tract pain and plea&s;ure are totally incon&s;i&s;tent.</P>

<P>On ab&s;tract good and evil&mdash;The phy&s;ical per|fection of the material univer&s;e, and the mo|ral harmony ob&s;ervable in the di&s;pen&s;ations of Providience.</P>

<HEAD>SUMMARY</HEAD>
<P>THE inquiries, of philo&s;ophers into the ab&s;tract cau&s;e of e|vil have hitherto been attended with little &s;ucce&s;s. In|deed, no &s;uch ab&s;tract evil exi&s;ts. For, whatever calamities human life be &s;ubject to, their <HI>evil</HI> depends merely on our own s;en&s;ibility. Even phy&s;ical evils, which are the lea&s;t contro|vertible, are evidently relative to their effects on the &s;uffer|ings, or enjoyments, of mankind. Whence they mu&s;t not be accounted ab&s;tract evils, or real defects in the general &s;y&s;tem of things: of which we have at pre&s;ent but a <HI>partial</HI> view; and therefore cannot tell how far apparent imperfections may conduce to the perfection of the <HI>whole.</HI> That human life is &s;ubject, neverthele&s;s, to palpable evils cannot be denied: but it &s;hould be con&s;ider'd that, as &s;uch evils are but temporary, and are evil but in proportion to the plea&s;ure, or good, by which they are contra&s;ted, we are not &s;en&s;ible of any ab&s;tracted evil, unle&s;s a &s;tate of humanity, on the whole, be attended with a greater portion, of pain than plea&s;ure. This is a&s;&s;erted by many; but is experimentally fal&s;e. Indeed, on a fair and im|partial e&s;timate, our &s;ufferings and enjoyments &s;eem to &s;tand on an equal ballance. Hence, al&s;o, if there be no ab&s;tract phy|&s;ical evil in the univer&s;e, there is as little rea&s;on for us to hold
<PB N="206" REF="224">
the exi&s;tence of phy&s;ical good; or to maintain that happine&s;s is the privilege of human life. That "whatever <HI>is</HI> is <HI>right,</HI>" with re&s;pect to the whole, is allow'd; but that it is therefore <HI>good</HI> is another con&s;ideration: <HI>goodne&s;s</HI> being a term relative to the happine&s;s of mankind, and not applicable to that general &s;y&s;tem. The famous principle of <HI>the BEST</HI> is therefore futile and frivolous&mdash;As to <HI>moral</HI> good and evil: we owe a &s;en&s;e of them purely to <HI>phy&s;ical:</HI> for had mankind felt neither pain nor plea&s;ure, they would never, from the light of nature, have ac|quir'd the ideas of moral good or ill. Tho&s;e actions, therefore, are morally good which give ri&s;e to more plea&s;ure than pain; and morally bad, <HI>vice ver&s;a:</HI> Innocence being, &s;trictly &s;peaking, neither good nor evil; and indeed incon&s;i&s;tent with a &s;tate of <HI>action.</HI> Moral evil appears, hence, to be, al&s;o, merely rela|tive to <HI>man;</HI> and can by no means be con&s;ider'd as a defect in the de&s;igns of Providence; unle&s;s we can be &s;o ab&s;urd as to &s;up|po&s;e it in the power of created beings to counterwork the in|tentions of their &s;upreme creator. On the other hand, moral good is equally relative, and can have no effect on the happi|ne&s;s of the fir&s;t cau&s;e, or plead any ab&s;tract merit with the Deity. Moral good and evil, however, in the agent, is ne|ce&s;&s;arily attended with temporary happine&s;s and mi&s;ery; in the

di&s;tribution of which, al&s;o, agreeable to relative merit, it is not improbable that impartial ju&s;tice is done, even in this life, in the perfect di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence.

On the contrary, this life may only be preparatory to a future; where the virtuous and vicious may be very diffe|rently di&s;pos'd of in the &s;cale of exi&s;tence.

<P>On moral principles&mdash;The re&s;pective influence of <HI>rea&s;on</HI> and the <HI>pa&s;&s;ions</HI>&mdash;The immorality of <HI>ignorance</HI> and the indi&s;pen&s;able duty of &s;eeking <HI>knowledge.</HI></P>

<PB N="259" REF="276">
<HEAD>SUMMARY.</HEAD>
<P>THE doctrine, by which virtue and vice are confe&s;&s;edly limited to this life, will doubtle&s;s excite the clamour of tho&s;e who pride them&s;elves, or ground their expectations of fu|ture happine&s;s, on their own merit. It may al&s;o be a&s;k'd, "To what purpo&s;e is it that mankind &s;hould pur&s;ue virtue rather than vice, if all our pains and plea&s;ures depend recipro|cally on each other, and our bad deeds neither actually offend, nor our good ones have any real merit with, the Deity." It is an&s;wer'd, that, as the merits and demerits of virtue and vice are partial and relative, &s;o al&s;o mu&s;t be conceiv'd their re&s;pec|tive rewards and puni&s;hments. So that, whatever di&s;tinction may be made between the virtuous and vicious in a future &s;tate, it mu&s;t be purely owing to the good plea&s;ure of our crea|tor, and not to the influence of our merit over his final deter|minations. &mdash;It mu&s;t not be conceiv'd, however, that this doctrine countenances immorality. On the contrary, it proves, that (as we are led to vice &s;olely by the motives of plea&s;ure, apparently attending the gratification of our de&s;ires) were a conviction always pre&s;ent to the mind, that &s;uch plea&s;ure mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be attended with an equal degree of pain, &s;uch con|viction might prove an antidote to vice, and pre&s;erve us, at lea&s;t, in innocence; the motive to action being thereby remov'd. As to actual virtue, indecd, it is not pretended that any ra|tional
<PB N="260" REF="277">
conviction whatever is, of it&s;e'f, a &s;ufficient motive to virtue: the u&s;e of rea&s;on being only to determine what is true or fal&s;e, ju&s;t or unju&s;t; and not to excite us to embrace either. This is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>pa&s;&s;ions;</HI> which are, however, in them&s;elves, neither good nor evil: tho&s;e di&s;po&s;itions of mind which are generally term'd virtuous being the frequent occa|&s;ion of our falling into vices, which oppo&s;ite ones, tho' general|ly di&s;approv'd or dete&s;ted, would have &s;ecur'd us from. Thus compa&s;&s;ion, benevolence and candour are the fertile &s;ources of vice; while hardne&s;s-of-heart, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and di&s;tru&s;t are as frequently the means of pre&s;erving innocence. Nay the fierce, harden'd and turbulent pa&s;&s;ions enter &s;ometimes into the mo&s;t virtuous characters; and a heart unaffccted by the pre&s;ent &s;uff'rings of humanity is, not unfrequently, nece&s;&s;ary to pre|&s;erve the rights and liberties of mankind. &mdash;In fact we are much deceiv'd, in the motives as well as in the practice of virtue; it being not only nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould mean to do good and take the be&s;t way our rea&s;on may direct us to effect it; but that we &s;hould previou&s;ly take tho&s;e mea&s;ures which are in our power, to acquire the knowledge of the means of doing &s;uch good. Wilful ignorance is declar'd therefore intentionally vi|cious; not having, tho' innocent in fact, the lea&s;t claim to merit; to which ev'n virtue it&s;elf hath but relative preten&s;ions. Indeed, as phy&s;ical good in the con&s;equence is the mea&s;ure of moral good in the <HI>action,</HI> the very appearance of <HI>merit</HI> in the <HI>agent</HI> in a great degree vani&s;tes; our power of doing good de|pending
<PB N="261" REF="278">
frequently on accident, and, not very &s;eldom on downright knavery. On all which con&s;iderations knowledge is laid dow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as a fundamental and indi&s;pen&s;ible moral principle; and, hence, the employment of our lei&s;ure hours in inquiries after tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> is pre&s;um'd to be not merely entertaining but morally virtuous.</P>

<PB N="301" REF="317">
<HEAD>SUMMARY.</HEAD>
<P>THE immortality of the &s;oul, or doctrine of a future &s;tate, is propos'd as the &s;ubject of inquiry. A doctrine, which, however true or fal&s;e in it&s;elf, is both weakly attack'd and lamely &s;upported by the philo&s;ophical arguments generally made u&s;e of, for, or again&s;t, it. Compari&s;ons drawn from the <HI>vegetable</HI> creation, however &s;triking, are partial and prove nothing. <HI>Moral</HI> arguments prove as little, unle&s;s we could fir&s;t be made certain that vice and virtue are not duly puni&s;h'd and rewarded in this life; or, unle&s;s we could entertain ade|quate ideas of divine ju&s;tice. With the&s;e, the metaphy&s;ical re|finements, concerning the &s;oul's <HI>immateriality,</HI> are &s;hown to be equally inconclu&s;ive. Our natural <HI>de&s;ire of exi&s;tence</HI> is expos'd, al&s;o, as a weak argument for the ju&s;tice of our claim to immortality. On the other hand, that <HI>intimate connection</HI> between body and mind, and their apparent dependance on each other, are &s;hown to afford rather a &s;pecious plea in favour of the immortality of the &s;oul, than, as frequently made to do, any argument again&s;t it&mdash;Setting, however, moral and me|taphy&s;ical &s;peculations a&s;ide, man is con&s;ider'd merely in the light of an <HI>animal.</HI> In which &s;tate of humiliation, his pre|ten&s;ions to a future &s;tate are, notwith&s;tanding, evidently ju&s;ti|fied on the plain and rea&s;onable &s;uppo&s;ition that, the Creator hath given to all animals &s;uch pow'rs and faculties as were nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;tate of <HI>being</HI> appointed them.&mdash;Now the evi|dent pur&s;uits of other animals tend &s;olely to the gratification' of
<PB N="302" REF="318">
them&s;elves or the mere pre&s;ervation of their kind. They have no intellectual &s;y&s;tem that extends beyond the life of the indivi|dual; nor doth their experience &s;erve to the improvement of their &s;pecies. With man it is otherwi&s;e: The pre&s;ervation and gratification of the individual, however powerful their motives, are in him made &s;ub&s;ervient to more general views: his ca&s;e, health and life being con&s;tantly &s;acrific'd to pur&s;uits, that are of no u&s;e to him merely as an animal; but, on the contrary, &s;erve to promote the intellectual perfection of his &s;pecies; hence apparently intended for the enjoyment of a &s;tate of exi&s;tence, to which tho&s;e faculties are adapted. In the powers of imagination and genius may al&s;o be trac'd that faint image of the Deity, in which man was confe&s;&s;edly made. So that philo&s;ophy alone affords us &s;ufficient rea&s;on to believe the certainty of a future &s;tate, without our having recour&s;e to con|te&s;ted authorities, the chimerical &s;uppo&s;itions of <HI>errour,</HI> or the ab&s;urdities of <HI>ignorance.</HI></P>
