<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of its Build|ing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS royal fortre&s;s &s;tands ea&s;t of the city
<PB N="26" REF="24">of London, near the bank of the Thames, where it may defend or command both.</P>
<P>The principal building, and from which it has its name, is the great white &s;quare Tower in the mid|dle. 'Tis a regular, &s;trong, lofty &s;tructure, and the old|e&s;t within the walls, being built by William the Con|queror, in the year 1078.</P>
<P>There are be&s;ides &s;everal
<PB N="27" REF="25">other con&s;iderable build|ings, that have been added to this grand fortre&s;s, at di|vers times &s;ince, of which I &s;hall &s;peak hereafter: the whole is encompa&s;&s;ed with a &s;trong wall, and that &s;ur|rounded with a broad deep ditch, &s;upplied with water out of the Thames.</P>
<P>The entrances into the Tower are over two brid|ges, one at the we&s;t end for carts, coaches, foot-pa&s;&s;engers,
<PB N="28" REF="26"><HI>&amp;c.</HI> the other over a draw-bridge from the wharf on the &s;outh &s;ide, facing the Thames, for: foot-pa&s;&s;engers only. It has be&s;ides a pa&s;&s;age from the river, call'd Trai|tor's-bridge; becau&s;e for|merly, all per&s;ons com|mitted to the Tower for trea&s;on were brought thro' it in boats.</P>
<P>The government of this important place, being of
<PB N="29" REF="27">high honour, as well as of great tru&s;t, is generally committed to a peer of the realm, who is ftiled <HI>Con|&s;table of the Tower:</HI> He has a deputy governor, and many other officers under him.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="30" REF="28">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the Lions, and other wild bea&s;ts in the Tower.</HEAD>
<P>WHen you have pa&s;&s;ed the two &s;oldiers, cal|led <HI>the &s;pur-guard,</HI> who &s;tand without the fir&s;t gate, you will &s;ee the figure of a Lion, again&s;t the keep|er's hou&s;e, right before you; and another over the door on your right hand, where you are to enter to
<PB N="31" REF="29">&s;ee the curio&s;ities &mdash; <HI>Here each per&s;on pays</HI> Three|pence <HI>for admittance.</HI></P>
<P>The wild creatures that are there &s;hewn, are all kept in &s;trong dens, &s;o that you need not be under any fear of danger from them; &mdash; Don't venture too near, and you may view them very &s;afely.</P>
<P>The dens are made in the form the pictures re|pre&s;ent; in which are
<PB N="32" REF="30">two rooms; the lower has &s;trong thick bars of wood, the upper, iron: in one of which the keeper &s;ecures the creature, whil&s;t the other is clean'd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And there are &s;ome &s;pare dens, in which are no wild bea&s;ts at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>You fir&s;t &s;ee a fine <HI>Maiden Lione&s;s,</HI> which was a pre|&s;ent from the con&s;ul of Algiers; &s;he is about four|teen years old: Her name is <HI>Jenny.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="31">Second, another <HI>Lione&s;s,</HI> from Africa, who&s;e name is <HI>Phillis.</HI></P>
<P>Third, a he <HI>Lion,</HI> nam'd <HI>Marco,</HI> con&s;ort to Phillis. He has maje&s;ty in his coun|tenance that &s;trikes an awe in the beholders; a grace|ful mane, of thick, long, &s;hagg'd hair, ornaments his &s;trong neck and &s;houlders: He has a huge head, and a prodigious wide mouth, with frightful teeth; this
<PB N="34" REF="32">

<PB N="35" REF="33">eyes are red, fiery, and &s;unk deep into his head; his no&s;e is very large, with wide no&s;trils: both his &s;ight and &s;melling are very &s;harp; his big-&s;inew'd legs and thighs are &s;trong, like bars of iron; and his claws, like hooks; five of which he has upon each foot be|fore, and four on tho&s;e be|hind, &s;heath'd like a cat's; with which lie &s;trikes, and catches his prey like that animal.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="34">His roaring voice is &s;o terrible, that it not only &s;trikes mankind with fear, but all creatures with &s;uch &s;urprize, that they dare not &s;tir: he may therefore, with the&s;e properties, he ju&s;tly &s;til'd the <HI>king of bea&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>Marco and Phillis are both from the &s;ame coun|try as Jenny; and were likewi&s;e a pre&s;ent from the con&s;ul of Algiers; each of them is about nine years old.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="35">This royal pair have bred &s;everal times in the Tower; they have a young <HI>prince</HI> of two years old, nam'd <HI>Nero,</HI> now to be &s;een there; be&s;ides three young ones, which were brought forth on the 19th day of June, 1740; whom we &s;hall pay our court to be|fore we go.</P>

<P>The fourth animal is a he <HI>Leopard</HI> from the Ea&s;t-Indies, about &s;even years old: This is a very beau|tiful

<P>The fifth, which is a &s;he <HI>Panther,</HI> call'd <HI>Jenny;</HI> the hair of this creature is &s;hort and mo&s;&s;y, and of a bright yellow, beautifully mark'd

<P>LIons, Tigers, Panthers, and Leopards, are fed
<PB N="75" REF="71">with &s;heeps heads and plucks twice a day; of which a Lion eats four or five in a day: but Leo|pards, Panthers, and Ti|gers, are much fonder of raw dogs-fle&s;h. They are always &s;eparated when they eat, or they would quarrel. The wild Lions of Africa are &s;aid to prey chiefly upon wild Boars: which &s;ometimes prove &s;o hard to conquer, that both
<PB N="76" REF="72">have been found dead to|gether in their gore. They drink as often as they drink as often as they plea&s;e, u&s;ually &s;everal times in a day; each having a &s;tone trought in his den.</P>
<P>The Lion being an ani|mal of a hot and thir&s;ty nature, was by the antients repre&s;ented as an emblem, or &s;ymbol of &s;ultry wea|ther.</P>
<P>The Tower has been a place for keeping of wild
<PB N="77" REF="73">bea&s;ts in above five hun|dred years.</P>
<P>On Sunday the 5th of Augu&s;t, 1604. a Lione&s;s, named <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> brought forth a young Lion in the Tower, which young one died the next day. This was the fir&s;t Lion whelp'd in that place, and probably in England.</P>
<P>The 26th of February following, the &s;ame Lion|e&s;s brought forth another
<PB N="78" REF="74">young Lion; which by command of King James, was taken from the dam as &s;oon as whelp'd, and nur&s;|ed by hand: but this al&s;o died in about &s;ixteen days.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t age any Lions have been known to live in the Tower, is about twenty years.</P>
<P>The Lion, in the day times, &s;eems to be a very &s;luggi&s;h, heavy animal, that hates to be rous'd, and is
<PB N="79" REF="75">no &s;ooner up, but, if &s;uf|fer'd, will immediately &s;lap down again: Perhaps, in the night they may be otherwi&s;e; it being more natural to them to &s;eek their prey in. The holy P&s;almi&s;t hath the like ob|&s;ervation: <HI>Thou make&s;t darnkne&s;s, and it is night: wherein all the bea&s;ts of the fore&s;t do creep forth. The young Lions roar after their prey, and &s;eek their
<PB N="80" REF="76">meat from God. The &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ari&s;eth, they gather them &s;elves together; and lay them down in their dens<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> P&s;al. civ.</P>
<P>The Lione&s;s goes with young exactly four months: None were ever known to have more than three at a litter. They are whelp'd with their eyes open, and are taken from the dam immediately, or they would peri&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="77">They are very tender, and require a great deal of care in nur&s;ing; it being exceedingly difficult to bring up a young Lion (and &s;o it is Tigers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) They often die in breeding their teeth, &s;ometimes in &s;trong convul&s;ions. The &s;ame is ob&s;erv'd by the people of Barbary, to hap|pen to the young wild Lions of that country, or they would be much more
<PB N="82" REF="78">numerous than they are in tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>Young Lions are kept about twelve months in a warm room, before they are put into dens; but be|fore they come to that age are chain'd, and are always &s;eparated when they eat their victuals. Their &s;avage nature comes on gradually as they grow up, and they are three years a coming to their full growth.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="79">It has been the common opinion, that the Lion is afraid of fire: their keep|ers deny that they are &s;o. One of them, who now attends the wild bea&s;ts in the Tower, going one night in the la&s;t hard win|ter to the den of the old Lion, with a lighted can|dle, held his hand near the bars, to &s;ee if the crea|ture was come down in|to the lower apartment;
<PB N="84" REF="80">when &s;uddenly he put out his paw, and wounded the man &s;o dangerou&s;ly in the back of his hand, that he very narrowly e&s;cap'd lo&s;ing it: And this he brings as an in&s;tance to &s;hew that they are not afraid of fire.</P>
<P>The Lion often &s;leeps and &s;nores with his eyes open, and likewi&s;e with them &s;hut.</P>
<P>King James the fir&s;t, be|ing
<PB N="85" REF="81">minded to make trial of the nature and courage of the Lion, and &s;ome o|ther wild bea&s;ts, went to the Tower, attended by &s;everal of the nobility; where he ordered a Lion and Lione&s;s to be turned out of their dens, and a Cock to be ca&s;t to them; which they pre&s;ently kil|led, and &s;uck'd its blood.</P>
<P>Next a Lamb was or|dered to be put to them,
<PB N="86" REF="82">which the Lions, out of their genero&s;ity, never of|fer'd to touch, although it went clo&s;e up to them.</P>
<P>Then two Ma&s;tiffs were let loo&s;e upon a &s;ingle Li|on, which they pre&s;ently &s;eized, and turn'd upon his back: and tho' the Lion was &s;uperior to them in &s;trength, yet they were his match in courage.</P>
<P>Some time after, a Lion was turned out of his den
<PB N="87" REF="83">to a Bear, which had kill'd a child; but the Lion would not attack the Bear.</P>
<P>They try'd &s;everal other &s;ingle Lions, and at length two together; but all fled from him, and wanted ra|ther to get into their dens.</P>
<P>A Stone-hor&s;e was put into the yard with the fir&s;t Lion and the Bear; the Hor&s;e, after a little while, fell to grazing between them, which they never
<PB N="88" REF="84">offer'd to touch. After|wards &s;ix Dogs were let in, who flew upon the Hor&s;e, mo&s;t in &s;ight at their fir&s;t entrance; and would &s;oon have worried him to death, had not three &s;tout fellows enter'd in, who re&s;cu'd the Hor&s;e, and brought away the Dogs; while the Lion and Bear &s;tood &s;taring up|on them. At this &s;ight were pre&s;ent King James
<PB N="89" REF="85">the fir&s;t, the Queen, Prince, and divers of the nobility.</P>
<P>And though the Bear which kill'd the child e&s;cap'd at this time; he was afterwards, by com|mand of the King, baited to death with Dogs, upon a &s;tage.</P>
<P>There was a Spaniel Dog, for &s;ome offence, ca&s;t into the Lion's den; but the Lion did not attempt to hurt him: and this
<PB N="90" REF="86">Dog continued in the den with the Lion &s;everal years, and there died.</P>

<P>Then you are &s;hewn a &s;mall train of <HI>Artillery,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of about ten pretty little <HI>cannon</HI> in car|riages; all ranged inn beau|tiful order: They were a pre&s;ent from the city of London to King Charles the fir&s;t, when he was a child, for him to learn the art of war by.</P>
<P>Two of the <HI>Danes clubs,</HI> each &s;ix foot long; de&s;pe|rate
<PB N="109" REF="105">rate weapons. The&s;e, we are told, are of great anti|quity, and that they have been in the Tower ever &s;ince it was built. The people who&s;e cu&s;tody they are now in, call them the <HI>womens weapons;</HI> becau&s;e, they &s;ay, in tho&s;e times, above eight hundred years ago, the women con&s;pired again&s;t the Danes, and de|&s;troy'd thirty thou&s;and, by cutting their throats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
