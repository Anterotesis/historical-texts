<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF MISS ELLIOT.</HEAD>
<P>MISS ANN ELLIOT, the &s;ubject of the&s;e memoirs, was born, at Tunbridge, of parents rather di&s;tingui&s;hed for their hone&s;ty than earth|ly riches. Her father was a &s;hoemaker by trade; but bu&s;ine&s;s not an&s;wering his ex|pectations, he was con&s;trained to get his living by mending of &s;hoes; which, being an indu&s;trious man, yielded him a com|fortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. His wife al&s;o con|tributed what &s;he could towards the &s;up|port of a numerous offspring, by taking in wa&s;hing, and &s;ometimes going to gen|tlemens
<PB N="2" REF="4">
hou&s;es, where &s;he was employed in the &s;ame occupation. I &s;hall confine my&s;elf alone to our heroine's adventures, without mentioning any thing of the other children, who&s;e hi&s;tories contain little be|&s;ides the common incidents of life.</P>
<P>She was born in the year 1743, and na|ture &s;eemed to have centered all perfec|tions in her. In proportion as &s;he grew up in years, &s;he appeared &s;en&s;ible of her charms, and on that account a&s;&s;umed a &s;uperiority over the re&s;t of her play-fel|lows. She was often heard to &s;ay, <Q>Such ugly creatures as they, are not fit to keep company with &s;o pretty a girl as me.</Q> This her parents beheld with pain; and as they feared &s;he would one day or other become the di&s;grace of their family, they endeavoured as much as they could to inculcate in her a more humble opinion of her&s;elf. Their care was, how|ever, entirely fruitle&s;s, as the event &s;hew|ed; for, at twelve years old, &s;he plainly told them, that the menial offices, in which &s;he was employed at home, were too much below her, who hoped, in time, to be rai&s;|ed much above the abject condition &s;he
<PB N="3" REF="5">
was then in. They then employed threats, and oftentimes the &s;evere&s;t corrections, but all to no purpo&s;e. She was always idle, and u&s;ed to &s;pend whole hours in admir|ing her&s;elf in the gla&s;s. She was never better plea&s;ed than when &s;he heard her beauty commended; and had even vanity enough to think that &s;he &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all her &s;ex in the lu&s;tre of her charms. It was indeed reported, that before &s;he had at|tained her fifteenth year, a young farmer had debauched her: certain it is, how|ever, that &s;he was ob&s;erved &s;ome time af|ter to grow remarkably big about the wai&s;t; and &s;he was taxed very clo&s;ely by her father and mother thereupon; but &s;he always denied it, till a few months after, not being any longer able to conceal her pregnancy, &s;he owned &s;he was with child by a &s;hoemaker, who u&s;ed to be frequent|ly at her parents hou&s;e. The time came, and &s;he was delivered of a fine boy; and the father promi&s;ing to take proper care of it, as &s;oon as her month was up, &s;he was ordered to leave her father's hou&s;e, and repair to London, they being re&s;olv|ed to &s;hew her no farther countenance.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6">She &s;et out from Tunbridge with a heart filled with joy at &s;eeing her&s;elf at liberty; and though her finances were very low, yet &s;he was not at all unea&s;y, as &s;he flat|tered her&s;elf they would &s;oon be increa&s;ed on her arrival at her journey's end. The morning &s;he left Tunbridge, the waggon al&s;o went away for London, and &s;he over|taking it, prevailed on the driver of it to let her now and then get up to ea&s;e her in her walk, her little &s;tock of money not being &s;ufficient to intitle her to a place in it; and in this manner &s;he reached Lon|don alone with the waggon. Being ar|rived in this great city, her next thoughts were what &s;he &s;hould do for her &s;upport. It was not long before &s;he accidentally met, one day, with Mrs. JAMES, who ex|claims, <Q>Lord ble&s;s me, NANNY, do not you know me? For heaven's &s;ake what brought you here?</Q> Mi&s;s ELLIOT'S a|&s;toni&s;hment at hearing her&s;elf called by her name, by a per&s;on entirely unknown to her, proceeded to interrogate the &s;tran|ger, in what manner &s;he became acquaint|ed with her. The old woman told her, that &s;he her&s;elf formerly lived in the &s;ame town where Mi&s;s ELLIOT was born, and
<PB N="5" REF="7">
that &s;he had left the country &s;hortly after her birth: &s;he then took our heroine home with her, and inviting her to dinner, which the other readily accepted of, &s;he promi&s;ed to put her in a way of living in a very genteel manner, provided &s;he would fol|low her advice, which Mi&s;s ELLIOT pro|mi&s;ed to do in every particular</P>
<P>This &s;age matron was well known in the cha&s;te pari&s;h of Covent-garden: &s;he had paid, for many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years, hou&s;e|rent, taxes, and hu&s;h-money, with the greate&s;t honour and punctuality. She was therefore in high repute among tho&s;e of the &s;ame trade, and her &s;hop was more frequented by the bucks of the town than any other in that neighbourhood. She re|joiced at having met with &s;o divine a crea|ture as Mi&s;s ELLIOT, and &s;he re&s;olved to make a great advantage of her. She told her the way of life &s;he was engaged in, and finding that her pupil's inclination for the &s;ame calling perfectly coincided with her views, &s;he bid her be of good heart, for that &s;he was born to great fortune; and advi&s;ed her withal inviolably to ob&s;erve what &s;he was going to &s;ay to her; which
<PB N="6" REF="8">
the other, with repeated a&s;&s;urances, told her &s;he would not fail to perform.</P>
<Q><P>My dear, &s;aid &s;he, you are very young, and con&s;equently have not been able to form &s;uch e&s;&s;ential plans as one of riper years, more experience, and greater opportunities. You are now entered on a &s;oone of life, perhaps the mo&s;t difficult to pro&s;ecute with &s;ucce&s;s. Cen&s;ummate prudence, and the mo&s;t heroic fortitude, are ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite to guide you through the thorny path that lies before you. Though you have beauty, breeding, and other accom|pli&s;hments of a woman, the&s;e will a|vail you nothing, if you do not employ them as your main artillery in the con|que&s;t of men; who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, follies, and caprices, you mu&s;t con&s;tantly &s;tu|dy, as the principal &s;prings by which you are to lead them at will.</P>
<P>The generality of men have many humours to be gratified, be&s;ides their amorous de&s;ires. Where vanity pre|vails, re&s;erve mu&s;t be u&s;ed, and pre|tence to a con&s;inement of your favour
<PB N="7" REF="9">
to a &s;elect number of men, and that upon a very perfect acquaintance only; by which you in&s;inuate, that your com|pany intitles you to a very genteel pre|&s;ent. If you indulge a man with the enjoyment of your per&s;on at the fir&s;t interview, you derogate from your con|&s;equcnce, and can expect but a tri&s;ting gratuity; for a woman's importance and difficulty of acce&s;s ever decide her va|lue. Remember, that while a &s;illy girl, who is lavi&s;h of her favours, rots in an ho&s;pital, the artful re&s;erved courtezan lives in pomp and &s;plendor.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t maxim on entering this way of life, is to declare perpetual war a|gain&s;t the male &s;ex in general; to love none, but &s;ecretly contemn, and artful|ly <HI>fleece them all.</HI></P>
<P>This, my dear, is not the effect of revenge, but the dictates of &s;elf-love and female prudence. If either &s;ex were to decide my hatred in proportion to their ill treatment, I &s;hould mo&s;t de|te&s;t my own; for to a woman, even
<PB N="8" REF="10">
that woman my mother, do I owe the cau&s;e of my pro&s;titution.</P>
<P>My father, who was a farmer, dying when I was young, my mother, whom her hu&s;band's death had involved in great difficulties, had much ado to &s;up|port me. As I grew up, I was taught the u&s;e of the needle, but I was far from having any inclination to &s;uch an em|ployment. I did not reflect on the &s;o|lid-rea&s;on my mother had for inuring me thus early to work, as I had no other provi&s;ion than what I earned by my fingers. I continued living in this manner, till I was fourteen years old, the fatal aera of all my misfortunes. About this time my mother was hard pre&s;&s;ed by our landlord for two years rent; for which, as &s;he could not pay, he threatened a &s;eizure; my mother took an opportunity to tell me, I had made my fortune, if I would act according to her dictates; for Mr. L&mdash;(the landlord) had actually de&s;ired me in marriage. I was charmed with the pro&s;pect of being a gentlewoman, and promi&s;ed to obey her. He accordingly
<PB N="9" REF="11">
vi&s;ited us once or twice a week, and was frequently left alone with me.</P>
<P>The day of &s;acrifice now approached, and my &s;uitor came at the u&s;ual hour. My mother told me to dre&s;s my&s;elf, for &s;he intended to pay a vi&s;it with me that evening in company with Mr. L&mdash;. Little &s;u&s;pecting the accur&s;ed de&s;ign of my infamous parent, I went into my bed chamber, and had no &s;ooner taken off my &s;tays to change them for a better pair, than the landlord bounced into my room embraced me, and told me, he &s;uppo&s;ed I was acquainted with the &s;ub|ject of his vi&s;it. I an&s;wered only with a blu&s;h; he proceeded to indecent beha|viour, upon which I loudly exclaimed again&s;t his damnable purpo&s;e on my ir|retrievable ruin.</P>
<P>My pious mother came, but not to my relief, for the mon&s;ter in&s;i&s;ted on my compliance, in&s;tead of endeavouring to re&s;cue me from infamy, from pro&s;titu|tion: ab&s;olute force compelled me to &s;ubmit, and I was thus cruelly &s;acrificed to the brutal lu&s;t of her vile landlord.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="12">But as ba&s;e de&s;igns are often render|ed abortive, the &s;acrifice of her daugh|ter's virtue exempted her not from the demand of the ungenerous, faithle&s;s, L&mdash;; for though he promi&s;ed that the grant of a favour from me &s;hould acquit her in his accounts, yet as &s;he had taken no receipt for the rent, when &s;he dete&s;tably thought to barter my virtue, her goods were &s;eized on in a few days, and &s;he was turned almo&s;t naked out of doors.</P>
<P>The impious wretch died &s;oon after in a goal, emaciated with the &s;tings of con&s;cience, and the prey of vermin, and I was left for a &s;upport on the wide world.</P>
<P>Nece&s;&s;ity &s;oon prompted me to have recour&s;e to pro&s;titution, and with that view I came to town, where, being a novice in the abandoned way of life, I was often cheated of my reward, nor was it long before I contracted a viru|lent di&s;temper, too frequently attendant on unfortunate women. At length, I purcha&s;ed experience at the deare&s;t rate,
<PB N="11" REF="13">
and my calamity taught me prudence and circum&s;pection.</P>
<P>From this time I always in&s;i&s;ted on my fee beforehand, and if I had any &s;u&s;picion of the &s;tate of my companion's health, I told him with a feigned counte|nance, that as he behaved like a gen|tleman, my ingenuity of temper obliged me to a&s;&s;ure him, that I feared I had received an injury my&s;elf. If he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted, I was certain he was di&s;or|dered, and peremptorily refu&s;ed him. All who had a &s;park of genero&s;ity, greatly applauded me.</P>
<P>By the&s;e, and &s;uch like arts, after &s;ix years public pro&s;titution, during which, I was only once injured, and that not materially, I acquired, through cunning and prudence, as much money as produced me an ea&s;y competence, by purcha&s;ing an annuity. Being above the nece&s;&s;ities of life, I am no longer common. I can de&s;pi&s;e mo&s;t men; their money indeed has charms; the be&s;t way however, is to flatter them
<PB N="12" REF="14">
with your love, and the expectation of enjoyment. Defer as long, therefore, as you can, the conferring of your favours, which once granted, cea&s;e to be &s;uch. In &s;hort, in all your proceedings, let your ultimate regard be to your own intere&s;t, and take care that your fond pa&s;&s;ions get not the a&s;cendency over your rea&s;on, then will you ever have in view the mo|tive of the men in &s;olliciting intercour&s;e with you, and your inde&s;pen&s;ible obli|gation of turning it to a &s;olid advan|tage.</P></Q>
<P>Mi&s;s ELLIOT li&s;tened to this narrative with the utmo&s;t attention; thanked her friend for the excellent in&s;tructions con|tained in it, which &s;he promi&s;ed to render, by every means, conducive to the &s;ame purpo&s;es &s;he now &s;o happily experienced. She was &s;o deeply affected with every par|ticular of Mrs. JAMES'S &s;tory, that &s;he determined on adopting &s;uch a plan of future operation.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s ELLIOT'S friend &s;oon recommend|ed her to one Mr. THOMPSON, a gentle|man who frequented the hou&s;e, and who
<PB N="13" REF="15">
was &s;o &s;truck with her beauty and tran|&s;cendent charms, that he declared he had never &s;een &s;o amiable a young woman be|fore. Her new lover, after having kept her company &s;ome weeks, during which time he u&s;ed to come every other day to vi&s;it her, was forced to be ab&s;ent for &s;ome months. During this interval Mrs. JAMES brought her acquainted with an old gentleman called Mr. BROWN, who appeared charmed with her per&s;on and accompli&s;hments, and &s;he gladly accepted his propo&s;als, though &s;he expre&s;&s;ed the inconvenience that would attend her being di&s;covered by the unexpected arrival of another gentleman, to whom &s;he was en|gaged, but who happened at that time to be out of town.</P>
<P>This new lover was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a great fortune in Jamaica, to which were added the &s;tricte&s;t probity and the nice&s;t &s;enti|ments of honour; in &s;hort he merited the much pro&s;tituted name of <HI>gentleman.</HI> He provided her elegant lodgings, and every thing el&s;e &s;uitable to the wife of a noble|man. He vi&s;ited her almo&s;t every day,
<PB N="14" REF="16">
and frequently u&s;ed to &s;up with her at her own lodgings. He was &s;o very polite, that if any thing prevented his going to &s;ee her, he would &s;end to let her know, that &s;he might not wait for him to no purpo&s;e. He grew &s;o fond of her, that having laid a&s;ide all &s;u&s;picion of her being able to be in love with any other man, he one day &s;ent Mon&s;ieur PAPILLOTTE, his French hair dre&s;&s;er, with a letter to her, intimating that he would &s;ee her the fol|lowing day. A &s;hort time, however, prov|ed that he was greatly over&s;een in hav|ing &s;uch a per&s;on for a me&s;&s;enger between him and his mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>PAPILLOTTE might be reckoned a hand|&s;ome fellow, and there was a tolerable ea&s;e in his addre&s;s. He delivered his me&s;|&s;age in &s;o hand&s;ome a manner, that Mi&s;s ELLIOT began to think him very capable of &s;upplying the place of his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>We may &s;uppo&s;e from Mi&s;s ELLIOT'S amorous di&s;po&s;ition, and irre&s;i&s;tible pa&s;&s;ion for variety, that the chief rea&s;on of her taking a liking to this fellow, was her having been confined to Mr. BROWN for
<PB N="15" REF="17">
&s;ome time; the natural incon&s;tancy of her temper getting the a&s;cendant, and di&s;|po&s;ing her to change for another, though of inferior accompli&s;hments.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erving that Mon&s;ieur PAPILLOTTE, after delivering his me&s;&s;age, was prepar|ing to take his leave with, a low bow, &s;he told him &s;he had &s;omething to a&s;k him about Mr. BROWN, and de&s;ired him to &s;it down, which, after a mode&s;t excu&s;e, he did. When he was &s;eated, &s;he drew her chair near his, and informing him, that &s;he feared Mr. BROWN was incon&s;tant, a&s;ked him how he thought a woman &s;hould behave to an incon&s;tant lover? He an&s;wer|ed, in that ca&s;e he would de&s;erve to ex|perience the like infidelity from his mi&s;|tre&s;s. By this &s;he perceived that PAPIL|LOTTE under&s;tood her meaning, but in order to enforce it the more, &s;he added, <Q>Surely, Mr. PAPILLOTTE, you &s;peak of incon&s;tancy as a thing pardonable in our &s;ex, as well as in your own.</Q> <Q>With|out doubt, Madam,</Q> replied he, <Q>it is ju&s;t de &s;ame ting; why &s;hou'd de gentilhomme have any privilege dat is deny to de lady?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="18">Things fell out in &s;uch a manner, that the Mon&s;ieur had very good rea&s;ons for not informing Mr. BROWN of the con|ver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed between them. But they repeated not long their &s;tolen joys, before they were detected by Mr. BROWN; for one day, having ta&s;ted joys too fierce to la&s;t for ever, they indolently repo&s;|ed, reclining on each other; Mi&s;s EL|LIOT'S keeper came in, and no &s;ooner &s;aw them in &s;uch a po&s;ture, then he fell upon Mon&s;ieur, kicked him round the room, and then down &s;tairs. Having recollected him&s;elf a little, he &s;ignified to the lady, that it was his re&s;olution to abandon her, and pre&s;enting her with a bank note of fifty pounds, left her once more to &s;eek her fortune in the wide world.</P>
<P>Being thus abandoned by her keeper, Mi&s;s ELLIOT'S only re&s;our&s;e was to ply the &s;treets for cu&s;tomers, as &s;he was not in a humour of going back to her for|mer landlady, Mrs. JAMES, who &s;he knew would not approve of her conduct. While &s;he continued in this cour&s;e of life, which grew very irk&s;ome to her, &s;he was one day met in the park by one who ap|peared
<PB N="17" REF="19">
to be a gentlemen by his dre&s;s, but who in reality was no other than a French valet; who, having found means to rob his ma&s;ter to a con&s;iderable amount, had made his e&s;cape from Paris, and pa&s;&s;ed in London for a nobleman, under the title of the Marquis de MARIVEAUX. This re|&s;pectable per&s;onage, who&s;e finances, by ex|travagant living, were reduced to a very low ebb, had long endeavoured to retrieve his ruined circum&s;tances, by marrying &s;ome young lady of fortune, now flatter|ed him&s;elf, that fortune, had at length thrown in his way the very per&s;on he &s;ought for, and accordingly &s;aluting her very re&s;pectfully, de&s;ired leave to wait upon her to a bench, where he begged &s;he would indulge him &s;o far as to hear a very hono|rable propo&s;al he de&s;ired to make to her. NANCY, hoping great advantage would ac|crue to her from this interview, con&s;ented; and Mon&s;ieur very politely handed her to a &s;eat, where, having placed him&s;elf by her, he talked to her in the following terms:</P>
<P><Q>I am, Madam, the &s;on of a gentleman of con&s;iderable fortune in Paris. My
<PB N="18" REF="20">
father is the king's banker, and I en|joy an income equal to the rank I hold in the world. I was obliged to fly from my native country in con&s;equence of a duel which I fought with a young count, who&s;e &s;i&s;ter, for whom I had a &s;incere love, had given her hand to ano|ther, in compliance to her brother's will, notwith&s;tanding &s;he had &s;worn ne|ver to be the wife of any other man than my&s;elf. To be &s;hort, Madam, I &s;lew my antagoni&s;t, and immediately went home, told my father what had happened; he advi&s;ed me to leave France directly, and having a po&s;t chai&s;e, I arrived in 48 hours at Calais, where, finding the packet boat ready to &s;ail, I embarked, and landed at Dover in about four hours, from whence I pur|&s;ued my journey, po&s;t, to London. I endeavoured to forget my misfortunes, and have &s;ucceeded tolerably well; and the better to &s;ecure to my&s;elf a la&s;ting tranquillity of mind, I have re&s;olved to marry the fir&s;t agreeable lady who will conde&s;cend to li&s;ten to my addre&s;&s;es, as the mo&s;t effectual means of enjoying that happine&s;s which I have been &s;o
<PB N="19" REF="21">
long a &s;tranger to. Deign therefore, charming Mi&s;s, to accept of this tender of my love, and allow me a place a|mong&s;t your numberle&s;s admirers.</Q></P>
<P>Mi&s;s ELLIOT heard him with the great|e&s;t attention, not interrupting him once all the time he was &s;peaking: when he had ended his di&s;cour&s;e, &s;he told him, that the &s;ubject of his conver&s;ation was too im|portant to admit of a ha&s;ty determination, and therefore begged &s;he might be allow|ed &s;ome time to con&s;ider of what he pro|po&s;ed to her. This reque&s;t was &s;o rea|&s;onable, that he was under an ab&s;olute ne|ce&s;&s;ity of complying with it, and &s;he having given him her addre&s;s, they parted.</P>
<P>Our heroine, who was as much deceiv|ed in her new acquaintance as he could po&s;&s;ibly be in her, ruminated with her|&s;elf, how &s;he &s;hould reap mo&s;t advan|tage from her intimacy with him. One afternoon, as &s;he &s;at reading in her dining room, &s;he heard a loud knocking at the door; and, pre&s;ently after, the maid came to tell her, that a foreign gentleman's &s;er|vant waited below with a me&s;&s;age to de|liver
<PB N="20" REF="22">
to her from his ma&s;ter. Mi&s;s EL|LIOT ordered her to &s;how him up &s;tairs directly; and at his entrance he acquaint|ed her, <Q>That his ma&s;ter, the Marquis de MARIVEAUX, de&s;ired the favour of permi&s;&s;ion to pay his re&s;pects to her, which he &s;hould e&s;teem equally a plea|&s;ure and an honour.</Q></P>
<P>This polite me&s;&s;age made Mi&s;s ELLIOT'S countenance glow with vanity; but being then in an undre&s;s, &s;he returned for an|&s;wer, <Q>that &s;he &s;hould be proud of the honour of &s;eeing the Marquis the next morning.</Q></P>
<P>He accordingly came between eleven and twelve the next day; and the fir&s;t complimentary &s;alutations being over, they entered into di&s;cour&s;e as freely as though they had known each other for many years. After &s;ome time &s;pent in this man|ner he took his leave, de&s;iring the favour of being permitted to renew his vi&s;it an|other opportunity; and &s;he in return a&s;|&s;ured him, that &s;he &s;hould always look on it as doing her a very great honour.
<PB N="21" REF="23">
He then politely withdrew, leaving his charmer va&s;tly exhilerated at the plea&s;ure of receiving a vi&s;it from &s;o accompli&s;hed a gentleman.</P>
<P>The pretended Marquis was of a very amorous complexion, and had met with pretty good &s;ucce&s;s among the ladies; though having never been in London be|fore, he had not found any opportunity of engaging in intrigues. From his conver|&s;ation with Engli&s;h gentlemen, he had ac|quired a tolerable knowledge of the tongue, and could conver&s;e on mo&s;t topics pretty freely.</P>
<P>To the&s;e accompli&s;hments, if an exqui|&s;ite knowledge of play be added, e&s;pecial|ly of the &s;harping part, to which he now owed his chief &s;upport, it will be ea&s;ily perceived that he was very well qualified to make a fa&s;hionable appearance in the world, to undertake any &s;cheme how ever imprudent or pre&s;umptuous.</P>
<P>At his fir&s;t vi&s;it he plainly &s;aw that &s;he was al&s;o a forune-hunter like him&s;elf, though of a different kind; and as the
<PB N="22" REF="24">
fortune of a game&s;ter is very precarious, he re&s;olved to keep her company, hoping to convert to his own u&s;e what her other lovers be&s;towed on her with &s;o great pro|fu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s ELLIOT, who had penetration e|nough to &s;ee that &s;he appeared very agree|able in the eyes of the Marquis, took an opportunity, one evening when he was at &s;upper with her, to enter into di&s;cour&s;e concerning love, and thereupon a&s;ked him, "What he thought of the Engli&s;h la|dies?" He an&s;wered, <Q>that the chief part of tho&s;e he had &s;een, were &s;o very beautiful as not to be equalled in the world; but he had hitherto been &s;o un|fortunate as never to be engaged in com|pany with any be&s;ides her&s;elf, otherwi&s;e he certainly &s;hould have lo&s;t his heart.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Oh! Sir, an&s;wered &s;he, if our Engli&s;h beauties are &s;o engaging, and your heart &s;o ready to be di&s;po&s;ed of, I think I have a prior claim to it.</Q> Mon&s;ieur &s;eemed charmed with this repartee; and Mi&s;s promi&s;ed her&s;elf mighty advantages from his aquaintance, in&s;omuch that,
<PB N="23" REF="25">
warmed with wine, they mutually agreed to &s;acrifice to Venus as to Bacchus; and the amorous enconter was &s;o &s;pirited on both &s;ides, the fir&s;t night, that they deter|mined to pa&s;s a &s;econd together before they parted.</P>
<P>Though Mi&s;s ELLIOT neither demanded, nor received any pecuniary reward at this interview, &s;he vainly flattered her&s;elf &s;he &s;hould be taken into keeping by the Mar|quis, and entertained in a manner agree|able to his pre&s;ent pompous appearance; but tho&s;e hopes were &s;oon bani&s;hed; for the pre&s;umptuous MARRIVEAUX, not only arrogated to him&s;elf a title to be rewarded for his &s;ervices, but, on her denial, availed him&s;elf of an opportunity of paying him|&s;elf the wages he thought his due.</P>
<P>His mi&s;tre&s;s indeed began to &s;u&s;pect the fallacy of his apparent dignity; yet &s;he was &s;o plea&s;ed with him as a gallant, that &s;he denied not her embraces whenever it was convenient, though &s;he now found a way to be introduced to the be&s;t company in town.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="26">Among&s;t other valuable things &s;he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, &s;he had been pre&s;ented by Mr. BROWN with a very fine brilliant &s;oli|taire, valued at two hundred guineas (the price of one night's lodging), which &s;he generally wore about her neck, tied to a black ribbon: on this the noble Marquis had fixed his eye, and laid many &s;chemes to get it in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, till the follow|ing at length &s;ucceeded: in the fonde&s;t moment of dalliance, under pretence of ki&s;&s;ing her &s;nowy bo&s;om, he made &s;hift to bite the &s;olitaire from the ribbon as it hung about her neck, without her perceiv|ing the fraud, and fold it to a jeweller in the city, who looked upon MARIVEAUX as a nobleman, &s;ince he bore the title, and maintained the appearance of one.</P>
<P>But the event proved, that the artful Frenchman was deceived in his prize; for having dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf one day in his gai|e&s;t apparel in order to vi&s;it an Engli&s;h lady of character and fortune, ju&s;t as he was &s;tepping into his chariot (a waiting job), he was arre&s;ted for one hundred and twenty pounds, at the &s;uit of the jeweller abovementioned.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="27">To the occa&s;ion of this arre&s;t he was an ab&s;olute &s;tranger; but he was obliged to &s;ubmit to it, and go to the hou&s;e of a bailiff; where, on &s;ending for the plaintiff, he was &s;urpri&s;ed to find that he was ar|re&s;ted for a fraud; and the &s;olitaire, which he told the jeweller co&s;t two hundred gui|neas, and &s;old for one hundred and twenty at &s;econd hand, a&s;&s;uring it on his honour to be brilliant, was only an ex|cellent pa&s;te.</P>
<P>This intelligence &s;truck him to the heart; and he was more concerned to find he had been impo&s;ed on, than to recollect the fraud in his own intention.&mdash;Here it will be nece&s;&s;ary to explain this my&s;tery.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of Mi&s;s ELLIOT'S acquaintance knew &s;he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this valuable jewel, which want of ca&s;h, for immediate purpo&s;es, obliged her to part with; and de&s;iring to conceal her nece&s;&s;ity from her friends, &s;he had agreed with an ingenious lapidary to make one of pa&s;te for her, which re&s;embled the real diamond as much as po&s;&s;ible: it was this that MARIVEAUX
<PB N="26" REF="28">
had artfully &s;tolen from her, and after|wards ignorantly &s;old it for that which it was only the repre&s;entation of.</P>
<P>He was no &s;ooner at liberty than he ac|cidentally met his Dulcinea, who branded him with the odious titles of impo&s;tor, villain, &s;harper, and every other oppro|brious appellation that female rage could po&s;&s;ibly &s;ugge&s;t: in con&s;equence of which, Mon&s;. le Marquis became the butt of general ridicule, and was pointed at every|where, as, what he really he was, a French &s;harper.</P>
<P>This induced him to change the &s;cene of action, by removing to Bath, but he was &s;oon exploded there, and treated with that contempt &s;uch in&s;olent pretenders to merit and dignity ju&s;tly de&s;erve.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s ELLIOT'S fame now grew daily, in&s;omuch that &s;he was invited to frequent Mr. Brown's, near Pallmall, a hou&s;e to which none re&s;ort but ladies of the fir&s;t rank, and &s;uch gentlemen who pay very liberally for their entertainment. Here &s;he has been honoured with a <HI>t&eacute;te a t&eacute;te</HI> con|ver&s;ation
<PB N="27" REF="29">
with &s;ome of the fir&s;t rank, who have thought them&s;elves happy in her arms, pre&s;&s;ing her panting bo&s;om, ta&s;ting the ambro&s;ial &s;weets that exhaled from her coral lips, and di&s;&s;olving in the&s;e exta&s;ies which tran&s;cend all de&s;cription, and can only be fully perceived by the mo&s;t ex|qui&s;ite &s;en&s;ation. Nor was &s;he inattentive to the benefits, which, on due ob&s;ervance, re&s;ult from the be&s;t company; &s;he acquir|ed the art of &s;aying a great deal with very little meaning; of ob&s;erving a due di&s;tance between the heart and the tongue; of pa&s;|&s;ing a <HI>double entendre</HI> with a good grace; and, in a word, of ca&s;ting the veil of am|biguity over all her words and actions.</P>
<P>Hence &s;he was adapted to the differ|ent tempers and di&s;po&s;itions of the &s;tu|dents who frequent this &s;eminary of Ve|nus, and could turn their &s;everal inclinations and peculiarities to her own emolument.</P>
<P>Among the re&s;t of the company, none v&s;ited her oftner, or paid her more libe|rally than Lord T&mdash;, who, though emaciated by a life of exce&s;s in every ener|vating plea&s;ure, always fixed his eye on
<PB N="28" REF="30">
the mo&s;t blooming girl, and coveted the &s;ociety of tho&s;e mo&s;t, whom, in a &s;en&s;ual view, he could lea&s;t gratify. However, he always made up his defect in one point by his profu&s;ion in another; and was therefore looked on a very valuable ac|quaintance.</P>
<P>It happened one evening, as his lord|&s;hip was drinking tea with Mi&s;s ELLIOT, at her lodgings, a loud knock was heard at the door, and the maid, after going down, came up and informed her it was Captain F&mdash;t&mdash;ue, who de&s;ired immedi|ately to &s;ee her.</P>
<P>The Captain, who received his title from being honoured with a company in the guards, had very little more than his com|mi&s;&s;ion to maintain him; and therefore though he wanted not the will of compen&s;at|ing the favours of a fine woman, he wanted the power. Our heroine was in a dilemma how to proceed in the ca&s;e: however, as the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs did not ad|mit of long deliberation, &s;he &s;ent down her compliments and de&s;ired to &s;ee him af|ter the opera at the hou&s;e of Mrs. Brown.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="31">Such is the infatuation of amorous pro|pen&s;ity in dotards, that the old Lord would by no means part with his choice piece till the hour in which &s;he appointed to meet the Captain; when relying on the folly and weakne&s;s of the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible and experi|enced of men where female charms are concerned, &s;he abruptly in&s;i&s;ted upon his lord&s;hip's ab&s;ence at that time, as &s;he had upon her hands an indi&s;pen&s;able engage|ment. Lord T&mdash;departed in a rage, declaring that &s;he had received the la&s;t fa|vour from him; but his attachment to her &s;oon compelled him to renew his vi&s;its.</P>
<P>Having delivered her&s;elf from the irk|&s;ome fondling of an impotent letcher, &s;he ha&s;tened to the embraces of youth. ul vi|gour, and made one of a brilliant a&s;&s;embly that evening, where &s;he had the &s;atisfaction of being taken notice of by a young no|bleman, who having attained the long wi&s;hed-for term of twenty one, and being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a large e&s;tate, was deter|mined to have the hand&s;ome&s;t mi&s;tre&s;s that could be met with; and for that rea&s;on rejoiced at this fortunate rencounter.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="32">Mi&s;s ELLIOT, who&s;e per&s;on and di&s;po|&s;ition were entirely formed for a lady of plea&s;ure, and who was remarkable for ne|ver remaining long in one place, without gaining a particular admirer, could not fail of engaging the heart of Sir THOMAS&mdash;, who from that time took her into keeping.</P>
<P>He hired her a hou&s;e near St. James's &s;quare, where they lived in great &s;plendor. She frequented all the public places, &s;ome|times with her keeper, and &s;ometimes with a female acquaintance, for &s;he was ac|quainted with &s;everal, who were all of her own profe&s;&s;ion. She had &s;everal fro|lics in gallantry unknown to Sir THOMAS, who did not confine him&s;elf to her alone, but frequently pa&s;&s;ed an evening with &s;ome other lady of his acquaintance. It was certainly noble and generous in him to in|dulge his mi&s;tre&s;s, while he did &s;o him|&s;elf, as well as acting perfectly conform|able to the golden rule.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="33">Mi&s;s ELLIOT took care to make good u&s;e of her liberty; and, for frolic's &s;ake, would &s;ometimes di&s;gui&s;e her&s;elf in boy's cloaths, and in that habit go into public places. Thus dre&s;&s;ed, &s;he had the air of a complete <HI>petit maitre;</HI> and with the greate&s;t ea&s;e imaginable a&s;&s;umed their tone and manner. Happening to go to the opera one evening, &s;he met with a young mu&s;queteer, who wore a gold laced hat with a white feather in it, and was dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;uit of white and gold. He &s;eemed &s;truck with her per&s;on; and both before the curtain was drawn up, and between the acts, addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to her with an affected air of politene&s;s. The piece be|ing ended, he invited her to his lodg|ings, where they had not been long, be|fore by &s;ome accident or other, he became acquainted with her &s;ex: however, he was far from availing him&s;elf of this di&s;covery, according to her expectations; &s;he &s;oon found that he was one of tho&s;e fribbles, who have neither power nor &s;pirit to en|joy what con&s;titutes the chief plea&s;ure of the more manrly part of the creation.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="34">Of this in&s;ignificant race there are many who profe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s the highe&s;t c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tempt for women, and are enamoured of their dear &s;elves alone; yet in de&s;pi&s;ing women they may be &s;aid to de&s;pi&s;e them&s;elves, as &s;eemingly they want nothing but the dre&s;s to be complete females; yet de&s;picable as the&s;e beings are, there are too many of them in this great metropolis.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s ELLIOT had not long lived in this round of plea&s;ures, before a period was put to them by the death of Sir Thomas, who was killed in a duel by a French gentleman, whom he had pro|voked by a&s;&s;erting the &s;uperiority of the Engli&s;h over the French, in point of government and political admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>She was afterwards kept by a Dutch merchant, who&s;e con&s;tant jealou&s;y was altogether in&s;upportable to her; and the confined manner in which &s;he lived with him, made her regret the liberty &s;he had enjoyed even at a bagnio. Though he had nothing engaging in him, &s;he was under a nece&s;&s;ity of being true to him, as &s;he
<PB N="33" REF="35">
dreaded his furious temper, &s;hould he de|tect her in an affair with any other per&s;on. She therefore re&s;olved on leaving him as &s;oon as fortune &s;hould throw &s;ome other more agreeable lover in her way.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s ELLIOT, who&s;e charms were too engaging to &s;uffer her to remain long without a lover, &s;oon found one, who ex|cepting the deficiency of the one thing nece&s;&s;ary, viz. a large fortune, was en|dued with every qualification capable of rendering any woman completely ble&s;t. This gentleman's name was M&mdash;y: he was about thirty, genteel both in his per|&s;on and addre&s;s. He became &s;o pa&s;&s;ion|ately fond of Mi&s;s ELLIOT, that every hour which was not &s;pent in her company was to him an age: her vivacity and na|tural good breeding had in&s;pired him with an irre&s;i&s;table pa&s;&s;ion for her: he indul|ged her in every thing that could pamper female pride, or in&s;lame her vanity. Her new keeper being an actor at one of the theatres, &s;he con&s;tantly frequented the playhou&s;e, 'till at length &s;he began to en|tertain a conceit of her dramatic talents, and being not a little humoured in the
<PB N="34" REF="36">
&s;ame by her acquaintance, &s;he determined to apply her&s;elf to the &s;tudy of acting, in order to &s;ubmit her capacity to the deter|mination of the managers.</P>
<P>To qualify her&s;elf for the arduous ta&s;k, &s;he attended particularly to the manner, action, and empha&s;is u&s;ed by the mo&s;t celebrated performers in their capital parts; and as &s;oon as &s;he returned home, would repeat the mo&s;t &s;triking pa&s;&s;ages, and en|deavour to imitate what &s;he had ju&s;t &s;een repre&s;ented. Her keeper al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;ted in perfecting her for this new undertaking; and he &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that &s;he at la&s;t became one of the mo&s;t eminent in her profe&s;&s;ion: and the part of MARIA, in the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">rated farce THE CITIZEN, was wrote on purpo&s;e for her, which &s;he filled with a degree of applau&s;e fearce ever be&s;towed on any &s;tage heroine.</P>
<P>But to proceed regularly. When &s;he imagined &s;he had &s;ufficiently qualified her|&s;elf, and had received the advice of tho&s;e &s;he thought proper to con&s;ult on the oc|ca&s;ion, &s;he determined to offer her&s;elf to the manager or one of the theatres. Ac|cordingly
<PB N="35" REF="37">
&s;he attended at his hou&s;e for a whole week together, without being able to gain admittance; in&s;omuch, that having lo&s;t many opportunities of getting money in her &s;tared employ, &s;he had almo&s;t re&s;olved to give up all thoughts of appearing on the &s;tage, after meeting with &s;o many difficul|ties in arriving at the pre&s;ence of the mana|ger, before &s;he could be examined concern|ing her real merit; adding to this, the little hope there was of being engaged when &s;o many had been already rejected. But &s;he was diverted from this re&s;olution by Mr. M&mdash;y, who informed her, that the&s;e were ob&s;tacles of a very tri&s;ling na|ture, in compari&s;on with tho&s;e &s;he had to &s;urmount; and that many had attended for &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years, and having been at length received, the con&s;equent advan|tages had abundantly retaliated all their pains and patience.</P>
<P>At length, however, &s;he obtained a hearing from Mr. G&mdash;k of Drury-Lane play hou&s;e; but, after rehear&s;ing &s;everal &s;peeches, was complimented on her figure, and promi&s;ing talents, and then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with a formal expre&s;&s;ion of concern, that
<PB N="36" REF="38">
his company was complete at pre&s;ent, and therefore he had no occa&s;ion for any addi|tional performer; yer, if he could find any opening for her the next &s;ea&s;on, &s;he might depend on an engagement.</P>
<P>Thus di&s;appointed in her fir&s;t applica|tion, &s;he repaired to one of the managers of the other hou&s;e, and was informed, that he could not act without the concurrence of the other proprietors, and as it re|quired &s;ome time to lay her ca&s;e before them, he mu&s;t beg her to wait the deter|mination till next week. At the expira|tion of the appointed time, &s;he attended, and, to her great joy, was received at a &s;alary of four pounds per week.</P>
<P>During the prevalence of her inclinati|on, to the drama, &s;he became acquainted with &s;everal ladies of the profe&s;&s;ion, who looked on her, as one in training to com|po&s;e their &s;ociety. She &s;oon di&s;covered, by the drift of their conver&s;ation, that many of them were not &s;upported by their &s;alaries, and that the principal de&s;ign in coming on the &s;tage, was not &s;o much for obtaining the income they were paid, as
<PB N="37" REF="39">
from the pro&s;pect of procuring a keeper: &s;everal were already on this footing, and tho&s;e who&s;e &s;ucce&s;s had not been equal, made a virtue of nece&s;&s;ity, and railed at tho&s;e they envied, becau&s;e they were more fortunate in their face, and, its con&s;e|quence, a lover.</P>
<P>This di&s;covery was a farther con&s;olation to her; and &s;he rejoiced, that in a theatrical life, there was no nece&s;&s;ity of giving up her gallantry; nor did &s;he long want a confir|mation of it, being addre&s;&s;ed on that &s;core by a young gentleman of rank, dignity, and every other attracting qualification.</P>
<P>Mr. M&mdash;y, who&s;e circum&s;tances (as has been already ob&s;erved) were &s;uch as would not allow him to an&s;wer her fre|quent pecuniary demands on him, ea&s;ily con&s;ented to her entertaining this new lover, provided &s;he did not refu&s;e to &s;uf|fer him al&s;o, &s;ometimes, to partake of her favours.</P>
<P>Mr. P-lm-r was &s;o enamoured of our heroine, that his prevailing pa&s;&s;ion, was to gratify her mo&s;t darling inclinations;
<PB N="38" REF="40">
and he &s;eemed to live but in her &s;miles; yet &s;o prevalent was her di&s;po&s;ition for &s;hifting &s;cenes in life, that a new object &s;oon engro&s;&s;ed her attention, and induced her to treat this generous lover with the utmo&s;t ingratitude.</P>
<P>Captivated with the elegant form and melodious voice of a certain &s;inger at the opera-hou&s;e, &s;he admitted him to &s;uch li|berties, even in the pre&s;ence of Mr. P&mdash;l&mdash;m&mdash;r, as could not fail of giving him high di&s;gu&s;t, and &s;oon proved the cau&s;e of their &s;eparation. Thus abandoned by this gen|tlemen, to indulge her natural propen&s;ity, &s;he cohabited &s;ome time with her mu&s;ical acquaintance, who found means to &s;trip her of what &s;he had procured during her connexion with him, and afterwards left her to provide for her&s;elf.</P>
<P>During her acquaintance with this Ita|lian, &s;he had often made a party at cards at a certain hou&s;e not far from Covent-Garden, where &s;he added to her know|ledge tho&s;e arts by which the worthle&s;s live with apparent &s;plendor, and the inex|perienced are trapanned, to their utter
<PB N="39" REF="41">
de&s;truction. The ho&s;te&s;s of this virtuous man&s;ion had long borne the &s;way in the li&s;t of wine-bibbers, and outvied all the bawds in the metropolis in drunkenne&s;s, ob&s;cenity, and bla&s;phemy. Here &s;he be|came acquainted with a noted game&s;ter, and her adventures with him were very &s;ingular. He was a fellow of mo&s;t di&s;&s;o|lute morals, and one of the many in this town, who, under the ma&s;k of gentility, ruin the unexperienced and unwary, by their premeditated fraud and villainy: &s;he was recommended to him, as one who&s;e per&s;onal charms might be advan|tageous to both.</P>
<P>He jumped at the hint, and a meeting was appointed: The old lady of the hou&s;e pre&s;ided, and propo&s;ed, that what|ever they earned in their re&s;pective occu|pations, &s;hould become a joint &s;tock, and be re&s;erved for their mutual demands and exigencies. The propo&s;al was readily a|greed to by both parties, who, after taking a chearful gla&s;s with their old friend, re|paired to a lodging provided by Mr. C&mdash;rke the game&s;ter. After a good &s;up|per, it was deliberated between them, what
<PB N="40" REF="42">
&s;teps Mi&s;s ELLIOT &s;hould pur&s;ue; and Mr. C&mdash;rke, profe&s;&s;ing the &s;incere&s;t regard for his amiable companion, and lament|ing the low ebb of his finances, which pre|vented the &s;tronge&s;t proofs of his pa&s;&s;ion, offered to recommend her to the chief wait|er at the be&s;t hou&s;e in the garden; expre&s;s|ing, at the &s;ame time, how di&s;agreeable it was to him to act &s;o mean a part, as that of pimp to a pimp; but that nece&s;&s;ity had no law, and it was prudent &s;ome times to hold a candle to the devil.</P>
<P>Having taken this re&s;olution, they went to bed, plighted vows of fidelity, and, af|ter many endearing carre&s;&s;es, and a hearty repo&s;e, awoke in the morning, fully de|termined to put their plan in execution. Accordingly they adjourned about du&s;k to the place appointed, called for the waiter, and invited him to &s;it down, and take &s;hare of the claret he had brought in.</P>
<P>Jack, who knew his bu&s;ine&s;s, behaved with great respect to Mr. C&mdash;rke, nor would he, till after much pre&s;&s;ing, be per|&s;waded to take the liberty of drinking the

lady's good health. When at the impor|tunity of them both he was &s;eated, Mr. C&mdash;rke, with a heavy &s;igh, thus addre&s;&s;ed him; <Q>Ah! hone&s;t Jack, is not that an exqui&s;ite piece? What an eye! What a &s;kin! What a panting &s;nowy bo&s;om! Sure I am the mo&s;t unfortunate fellow on earth, to love this peerle&s;s woman to di&s;traction&mdash;but an unlucky run at play lately, and the confounded mar|riage noo&s;e, prevent me from te&s;tifying the exce&s;s of my affection: therefore, Jack, if you would win my heart for ever, take her under your care, u&s;e her as &s;he de&s;erves; &s;he would grace the arms of an emperor, and will do you honour; therefore be cautious in your recommendations, &s;he is not for vulgar palates, nor will ever conde&s;cend to grant her favours but on very valuable con&s;iderations.</Q></P>
<P>"Sir," an&s;wered the waiter, <Q>I take her at your recommendation, and will do as well by her as you can de&s;ire; I expect a con&s;tant cu&s;tomer of mine to-morrow night; indeed, neither his pur&s;e nor appearance are adequate to

the de&s;ert of women of the fir&s;t cla&s;s in my li&s;t. He never gives more than two guineas; but then the girls tell me it is for doing nothing; be&s;ides, Sir Tho. S&mdash;and Col.

<P>Mi&s;s ELLIOT &s;ignified her con&s;ent by her &s;ilence, and the game&s;ter by an hear|ty acknowledgment of the favour; after which, having fini&s;hed the &s;econd bottle, they departed highly plea&s;ed with their fu|ture pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The next day means were concerted between them for procuring a proper dre&s;s for our heroine to appear in at night; after much &s;tudy, to little purpo&s;e, Mr. C&mdash;rke propo&s;ed to pledge his watch, which would enable her to redeem her own, with other nece&s;&s;aries for the ap|proaching &s;cene.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="45">Accordingly the money advanced, and what Mr. C&mdash;rke had be&s;ides, equip|ped Mi&s;s ELLIOT very elegantly, and rai&s;ed their hopes of a very &s;ucce&s;sful ad|venture: nor were they di&s;appointed, for the lady wrought &s;o effectually on the three old letchers, Sir Tho. S&mdash;, Col. D&mdash;gl&mdash;s, and lord R&mdash;hf&mdash;d, that an e|mulation was excited among&s;t them to obtain the a&s;cendency in her favour, and each &s;trove to excel in point of promi&s;es. As the&s;e old gentlemen were peculiar in their di&s;po&s;itions, a &s;ketch of their cha|racters may not be unacceptable.</P>
<P>Sir Tho. S&mdash; was born to an im|men&s;e fortune; but through an ince&s;&s;ant devotion, during a con&s;iderable number of years, to Bacchus and Venus, the major part was exhau&s;ted; and at length, when his con&s;titution would no longer admit of his criminal indulgencies, he &s;unk his la&s;t two thou&s;and in the funds, which pro|duced him an annuity of two hundred; but from his emaciated carca&s;s, it was not to be &s;uppo&s;ed he could ever live to re|ceive half the &s;um he had &s;unk.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="46">Though he tottered at the age of forty-five, a hand&s;ome woman would bring a glow on his cheeks, and cau&s;e him to ex|hibit the &s;hamele&s;s picture of inordinate de&s;ire, combating with premature impo|tence, and cur&s;ing the former vehemence of his pa&s;&s;ion, which had brought on debility &s;o long before its natural cour&s;e. He was, in &s;hort, a compo&s;ition of ve|nery and ebriety, living but to gratify tho&s;e appetites common to men and brutes, &s;till coveting the company of the fine&s;t women merely to indulge the remem|brance of his pa&s;t exce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Colonel D&mdash;gl&mdash;s was &s;anguine in his attachment to the fair &s;ex, without &s;uffer|ing them to engro&s;s his attention: he en|joyed life without abridging it by intem|perance; and though his de&s;ires when young were very prevalent, he called in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the rational to check the wild &s;allies of the animal. Hence he long reigned ths favourite of the women and envy of the men, till he gradually &s;unk into years, and continued lively in di&s;po|&s;ition, though feeble in body, at the age of &s;eventy-two. He loved, however, in
<PB N="45" REF="47">
his gayer hours to bill a little, and wi&s;ely con&s;idering that his company could not be very agreeable to &s;portive youth, gene|rou&s;ly compen&s;ated their trouble, which rendered him a de&s;irable acquaintance to female town adventurers.</P>
<P>Lord R&mdash;hf&mdash;d was robu&s;t at the age of &s;ixty, and capable of enjoying the care&s;|&s;es of a female charmer. His greate&s;t plea&s;ure was to &s;acrifice to Venus; nor did he &s;tick at any expence, to obtain a fir&s;t rate beauty, who, when in his po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, could mould him as &s;he plea&s;ed, being extremely pliant in a female hand, though in other re&s;pects &s;tern and re&s;olute.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the characters to whom Mi&s;s ELLIOT, according to Jack's promi&s;e, was introduced, as company mo&s;t adapt|ed to an&s;wer her lucrative views. Not to dwell on the di&s;gu&s;ting theme of what pa&s;&s;ed between the enamoured dotards and the artful courtezan, it will &s;uffice to remark, that as &s;he was engaged by prior contract to Sir Thomas S&mdash;, &s;he &s;pent the evening in company with the de|bilitated fake, mortified the whole time,
<PB N="46" REF="48">
with his nau&s;eous talk, and more in&s;up|portable behaviour.</P>
<P>Nor did Sir Thomas's engro&s;&s;ing her till next morning cool the pa&s;&s;ion which Lord R&mdash;hf&mdash;d had conceived for her; he &s;ent for her the following evening to the &s;ame place, and having regaled her with a ve|ry elegant &s;upper, pa&s;&s;ed the night with her in abundant delight, in&s;omuch that he took her into keeping, pre&s;ented her with an immoderate quantity of rich cloaths, and valuable jewels; &s;o that few women appeared in public more elegantly dre&s;&s;ed, nor was the ta&s;te of any woman more applauded or imitated.</P>
<P>This lucky incident enabled her to &s;upply Mr. C&mdash;ke with more than he could rea&s;onably demand; and the con|nexion between them was very artfully pre&s;erved; for Mi&s;s ELLIOT, too wi&s;e to tru&s;t any &s;ervant with that, the knowledge of which always rendered them in&s;olent, as it gives them a power to injure a mi&s;|tre&s;s in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential concern, carried on her intrigues by means of Jack, who conveyed her letters to Mr. C&mdash;rke, and
<PB N="47" REF="49">
thereby obviated all po&s;&s;ibility of detec|tion.</P>
<P>As &s;he reaped great advantages from this connexion, &s;he made Lord R&mdash;hf&mdash;d's will her plea&s;ure, and &s;tudied by every en|dearing in&s;tance of behaviour to improve the e&s;teem he had conceived for her.</P>
<P>This conduct greatly redounded to her intere&s;t; for Lord R&mdash;hf&mdash;d, grateful in di&s;po&s;ition, and profu&s;ely generous in love, was daily loading her with pre&s;ents, in&s;o|much, that notwith&s;tanding her di&s;bur&s;e|ments to Mr. C&mdash;rke, whom &s;he now main|tained in &s;plendor, &s;he ama&s;&s;ed a very con|&s;iderable &s;um.</P>
<P>Thus &s;he pa&s;&s;ed about &s;ix months with Lord R&mdash;hf&mdash;d, till an imprudent &s;tep oc|ca&s;ioned a &s;eparation. His lord&s;hip went out of town, with intention, as was &s;up|po&s;ed, to &s;tay a month. He had deter|mined to leave his charmer in London, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould attract the notice of &s;ome other gentlemen younger than him&s;elf, and thereby endanger his lo&s;s of what he deem|ed an invaluable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="50">As things were in this &s;ituation, and there was hardly cau&s;e for &s;u&s;picion of de|tection, our heroine ventured to Vauxhall with Mr. C&mdash;rke; but ill luck brought Lord R&mdash;hf&mdash;d there al&s;o. One of the very fir&s;t objects that pre&s;ented it&s;elf to his lord&s;hip, amid&s;t &s;o great a vari|ety, was his mi&s;tre&s;s <HI>t&eacute;te a t&eacute;te</HI> with Mr. C&mdash;rke, u&s;ing &s;uch freedoms as were far from being agreeable, and gave him no little cau&s;e of unea&s;ine&s;s, as they did her of future repentance.</P>
<P>This unlucky accident &s;truck both Mi&s;s ELLIOT and her favourite with amaze|ment and confu&s;ion; they therefore im|mediately retired from the gardens, in or|der to con&s;ult on the mo&s;t probable means of averting Lord R&mdash;hf&mdash;d's re&s;entment. After much deliberation it was agreed, that &s;he &s;hould ha&s;ten home, and anticipate his reproof, by a&s;&s;uring him of the conti|nuance of her e&s;teem and veneration for him; and de&s;iring that the late circum&s;tance might not be con&s;trued as any deviation from the duty &s;he owed him, as &s;he was only in company with a fir&s;t cou&s;in, who
<PB N="49" REF="51">
had in&s;i&s;ted on attending her to Vaux|hall.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s ELLIOT, pur&s;ant To this re&s;olu|tion, made all the ha&s;te &s;he could home; and upon his lord&s;hip's arrival, notwith|&s;tanding his &s;tern contracted brow, thus addre&s;&s;ed him, <Q>My dear Lord, if your countenance be the index of your mind, &s;omething hath much di&s;plea&s;ed you: I tru&s;t it is not owing to any &s;u&s;picion of my being defective ei|ther in duty or love. If it is, permit me to a&s;&s;ure you, that I retain the e|&s;teem and veneration for you I have al|ways profe&s;&s;ed, and that all jealou&s;y on account of &s;eeing me at the gardens is groundle&s;s, as I was then in company with a fir&s;t cou&s;in, a married man, and per&s;on whom I never con&s;idered in any other light than as a friend and re|lation.</Q></P>
<P>To aggravate this misfortune, Lord Rmdash;hfmdash;d knew Cmdash;rke's infamous cha|racter, and had &s;een him kicked out of bil|liard-rooms, and tennis-courts, as a gambler
<PB N="50" REF="52">
and &s;harper; fired therefore with double re&s;entment at his mi&s;tre&s;s's connexions with one of the vile&s;t of mankind, he at once upbraided her with the opprobious terms of whore, jilt, and liar; and or|dered her the next morning to quit his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>After &s;o &s;evere a reprimand, &s;he endea|voured to appea&s;e his anger, but finding that neither tears nor intreaty would pre|vail, &s;he retired to a &s;eparate chamber and &s;pent the night in ruminating on the di&s;|mal con&s;equences that were likely to at|tend the imprudent conduct of her&s;elf and Mr. C&mdash;rke.</P>
<P>Lord R&mdash;hf&mdash;d no &s;ooner aro&s;e in the morning, than he &s;ent his man to call the faithle&s;s fair one before him. She came trembling into his pre&s;ence, and received her di&s;mi&s;&s;on in the following reproachful terms; <Q>Ungrateful, de&s;picable wretch, who ha&s;t preferred the embraces of a villain, a branded &s;coundrel, to the e&s;teem of a man of honour, Be gone, with all thy guilt upon thy head, nor
<PB N="51" REF="53">
dare, on the &s;evere&s;t penalty, to &s;et one foot hereafter on my thre&s;hold. Take that bundle, which contains cloaths merely nece&s;&s;ary; I will not pro&s;titute my valuable effects to deck a worthle&s;s woman, but keep them for one more de&s;erving of my favours.</Q></P>
<P>Finding her fate in this re&s;pect irre|vocable, her tears dried up, and the ma&s;k of di&s;&s;imulation was removed; the true woman bur&s;t into an immoderate &s;it of laughter, and the parting &s;cene con|cluded with her ob&s;erving, that &s;he al|ways looked on my Lord as a fool, as well as every keeper, who expected a woman to be true to him, in &s;pight of her intere&s;t or her pa&s;&s;ion; and, that to find a whore faithful to any other influence, was very difficult, if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>She then took her bundle, and went immediately to the tavern where her friend the waiter lived, and there met with Mr. C&mdash;rke, according to appointment. Here they regaled them&s;elves with a good din|ner, and affecting little concern about her lo&s;s, pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome hours in recapitulating
<PB N="52" REF="54">
the weakne&s;s and folly of Lord R&mdash;hfmdash;d, in being blinded by his pa&s;&s;ions, and pay|ing &s;o dearly for what might be purcha&s;ed at a much ea&s;ier rate.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s ELLIOT had cautiou&s;ly concealed all the particulars of her di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from Mr. C&mdash;rke; the latter therefore, being very anxious to know what prizes the former had &s;ecured, began immediately, on their arrival at their lodgings, to enquire con|cerning the manner in which &s;he intended to bring off her rich cloaths, jewels, and other valuable commodities; but great was his &s;urprize when &s;he told him, with a dejected countenance, that his Lord|&s;hip's knowledge of his life and character greatly added to his re&s;entment, and pre|vented her bringing off any thing of value, as he had &s;ecured all; and told her his property &s;hould not be pro&s;tituted to the u&s;e of &s;coundrels, pimps, and gamblers.</P>
<P>Thus deprived of the booty he expected, he began to look upon Mi&s;s ELLIOT with great indifference, and would frequently upbraid her as being the occa&s;ion of their appearing in public together, which had proved &s;o fatal to them both.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="55">As &s;he had now no more cloaths than were nece&s;&s;ary for a decent appearance, and he had a few days before lo&s;t his la&s;t guinea at the hazard table, and therefore could not a&s;&s;i&s;t her in making a figure for polite company; C&mdash;rke began to enter|tain thoughts of contracting an acquain|tance with &s;ome woman, who&s;e &s;ituation in life might render her more capable of an&s;wering his purpo&s;es, than Mi&s;s Elliot was at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>To promote this de&s;ign, he vi&s;ited all places frequented by ladies of plea&s;ure, and being comely in per&s;on, and ver&s;ed in tho&s;e arts which prevail with women of weak minds, he &s;oon ingratiated him&s;elf with a lady who was kept by an old cit at a very genteel allowance. This woman being exce&s;&s;ively amorous, and her keeper very impotent, conferred her favours on &s;everal young fellows for value received, and was at that time infected with a certain popular di&s;temper, which &s;he communica|ted to C&mdash;rke the very fir&s;t time he was admitted to her embraces.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="56">As the connexion was not entirely broken off between him and Mi&s;s ELLIOT, (for &s;he could as yet procure a trifle on her cloaths) &s;he partook of the pre&s;ent, and was at length convinced of the &s;elf-in|tere&s;tedne&s;s of Mr. C&mdash;ke. When &s;he up|braided him with the di&s;ingenuity of his conduct, in&s;tead of a due acknowledg|ment, he treated her with the utmo&s;t di&s;|dain; told her to have no farther depen|dence on him; and packing up the few rags he had le&s;t, bounced out of the room, which he never more entered.</P>
<P>Thus did this &s;candal to humanity act entirely con&s;i&s;tent with his character; for, having lived upon a woman as long as &s;he could admini&s;ter to his idlene&s;s and vanity, he left her in circum&s;tances of the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, in the mo&s;t deplorable &s;ituation, to which he had chiefly contributed to re|duce her.</P>
<P>She was now brought to the mo&s;t per|plexing dilemma; &s;he not only wanted mo|ney, but cloaths, the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary ap|pendage of her profe&s;&s;ion; nor could &s;he
<PB N="55" REF="57">
take one &s;tep to her advantage in her pre|&s;ent garb.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation (M&mdash;y not being able to a&s;&s;i&s;t her) her only re&s;ource was to apply to one of tho&s;e ladies called tally wo|men, in order to procure, at a mo&s;t exor|bitant premium, the loan of part of her tawdry wardrobe: accordingly, &s;he bor|rowed of Mrs. LAMB a complete dre&s;s in the newe&s;t ta&s;te, for which &s;he was to pay no more than a guinea per night.</P>
<P>Thus equipped, &s;he promi&s;ed her&s;elf much &s;ucce&s;s; but as &s;he was not a new face upon the town, &s;he was much di&s;|appointed in her expectations; for at the clo&s;e of the fir&s;t adventure, &s;he could not mu&s;ter half the amount of her clothes hire. Hoping that the en&s;uing week would prove more fortunate, &s;he continued her contract with Mrs. LAMB, and was elegantly equipped every night; but that proved very little better than the former, in&s;omuch that &s;he became indebt|ed to this con&s;cientious lady upwards of nine guineas.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="58">According to the general cu&s;tom of the&s;e people, a note of hand was immediately demanded as a &s;ecurity for the debt, and the period &s;he had fixed for the payment expiring before &s;he was able to fulfil her promi&s;e, Mrs. Lamb, without giving any previous notice after the fir&s;t demand, cau&s;ed Mi&s;s ELLIOT to be arre&s;ted, and conducted to the Mar&s;hal&s;ea.</P>
<P>Here a new &s;cene opened to her view, a &s;cene which demon&s;trated the fatal ef|fects of vice and folly: here were &s;everal &s;he had known before in the <HI>beau monde,</HI> &s;ome of whom were &s;aid to be dead, others retired into the country, and others gone abroad.</P>
<P>In this forlorn &s;ituation, &s;he found her|&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of making an ac|quaintance with &s;ome of the inhabitants of this immured man&s;ion. As to the fe|male inmates, they were for the mo&s;t part, like her&s;elf, ladies of plea&s;ure; who ha|ving in general lo&s;t their credit, were thrown there in hopes &s;ome kind gentle|man, with more money than wit, would

pity and relea&s;e them from their confine|ment, by di&s;charging their debts,</P>
<P>The morning after her arrival &s;he was waited on by a celebrated mi&s;s, who, from bring a common pro&s;titute, had been ex|tolled for her wit and reading, becau&s;e &s;he had acquired a &s;mattering of common-place quibbles, and a few &s;entences of Latin, which &s;he frequently introduced without regard either to decency or pro|priety. This fal&s;e reputation procured her a number of wealthy admirers, among&s;t whom was an old dotard, who was &s;o en|raptured with her that he admini&s;tered to her mo&s;t exhorbitant demands, and &s;ettled on her a very con&s;iderable annuity.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this extraordinary fond|ne&s;s and genero&s;ity, &s;he &s;o rarely requited his favours, that at length, di&s;gu&s;ted with her behaviour, he e&s;tranged him&s;elf from her embraces and her company. Her ex|travagance and debauchery, though her annuity was regularly paid, compelled her to di&s;po&s;e of it &s;hortly after their &s;epara|tion; and &s;he &s;oon expended the money ari&s;ing from it.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="60">Some of her creditors, being acquainted with the &s;ituation of her affairs, were in|duced to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch effects as were in her power; and with that view brought an execution into the hou&s;e. This &s;tep being made public, tho&s;e of her cre|ditors who had received no &s;atisfaction from her goods, re&s;olved to &s;eize on her per&s;on; which they accordingly did, and depo&s;ited it in this convenient receptacle.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s ELLIOT was not ignorant of &s;o remarkable a character; and therefore, af|ter a &s;hort interview, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her, with many acknowledgments of her kindne&s;s, and promi&s;ed, on the fir&s;t lei&s;ure, to re|turn the vi&s;it.</P>
<P>Our heroine had not been many days confined before &s;he met with an old ac|quaintance, under the &s;ame circum&s;tances with her&s;elf: this was Mr. N&mdash;rth, who, thinking him&s;elf i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l u&s;ed by the imperti|nent demands of his creditors, had deter|mined to puni&s;h their in&s;olence, by taking the benefit of the act of grace.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="61">Here was a plain proof of the meanne&s;s of &s;oul of this pretended gentleman, who could conde&s;cend to &s;uch low &s;ubter|fuges to evade the payment of his ju&s;t debts, and &s;ubmit to the lo&s;s of his repu|tation, and the publication of his name to all the world as a common cheat, in order to open a way for a renewal of his vil|lainies in &s;ome part where he was le&s;s known.</P>
<P>Thus, remote from the gayer &s;cenes of life, &s;he had time to reflect on the mi&s;e|ries, attending her profe&s;&s;ion, and from which &s;he had now no po&s;&s;ible view of being delivered. Being de&s;titute of mo|ney, and every thing that could procure it; and Mr. M&mdash;y, who had intro|duced her to the &s;tage, being unable to afford her the a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;he required, &s;he &s;ent for Mrs. Lamb, remon&s;trated with her on the folly of depriving her of all po&s;&s;ibility of making her any compen&s;a|tion; and told her, that if &s;he would re|lea&s;e her from confinement, &s;he would re|&s;ign her&s;elf wholly to her di&s;po&s;al, and &s;ubmit to any terms &s;he &s;hould plea&s;e to propo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="62">This humble behaviour of Mi&s;s ELLIOT induced her compa&s;&s;ionate creditor to &s;of|ten a little, &s;o that her propo&s;al was com|plied with, and &s;he relea&s;ed, after giving a promi&s;&s;ary note to her benefactre&s;s, and therby devoting her&s;elf to the &s;ervice of a wretch lo&s;t to virtue, ju&s;tice, and hu|manity.</P>
<P>The unfortunate Mi&s;s ELLIOT, in con|&s;equence of the late favour &s;he received from Mrs. LAMB, became an ab&s;olute &s;lave to the mo&s;t mercenary and abandon|ed of women; who had long lived on the wages of pro&s;titution, and was di&s;po&s;ed for the commi&s;&s;ion of all that is vile and ba&s;e, if it could admini&s;ter to her luxury and avarice. Being wholly dependent on her for board, lodging, and clothes, &s;he was treated in the mo&s;t haughty and &s;u|percilious manner, frequently threatened with being &s;ent back to her old lodging, and &s;ometimes bore the marks of her landlady's di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Having; incurred a con&s;iderable debt and &s;tanding very high in Mrs. LAMB'S

books, &s;he dreaded entering her lodgings at the clo&s;e of a night's incur&s;ion without money; therefore, when &s;he met with no &s;ucce&s;s, &s;he would parade the &s;treets very late; which circum&s;tance added a new weight to her former woes. It unfortu|nately happened, that, walking the Strand on a &s;earch night, &s;he was &s;eized by a con|&s;table; and, notwith&s;tanding her remon|&s;trances, forced away to the round hou&s;e. She now found her&s;elf under the di&s;agree|able nece&s;&s;ity of pa&s;&s;ing the remainder of the night there, as &s;he was incapable of bribing the con&s;table, who never objected to a genteel offer from the hands of an un|fortunate woman.</P>
<P>Our heroine, who&s;e &s;pirits were not the mo&s;t ea&s;ily dejected, was neverthele&s;s ter|rified at this outrage, and gave vent to her grief in a &s;lood of tears.</P>
<P>The humane con&s;table, perceiving her concern, advi&s;ed her to have &s;omething to comfort her; and without waiting for her reply &s;ent for a bottle of wine.</P>
<P>She began to entertain &s;ome opinion of this officer's compa&s;&s;ion, and readily ac|cepted
<PB N="62" REF="64">
the gla&s;s he offered her, but was &s;oon convinced that &s;he was to be treated at her own expence; for the man, who brought the wine, waited till &s;he paid him for it the la&s;t half crown &s;he had in the world.</P>
<P>She had now plucked up &s;pirits &s;uf|ficient to enquire, whether &s;he could not get a per&s;on to go and acquaint a friend with what had befallen her; but it being by this time pa&s;t twelve, they pretended they could find no body to go till the men came off the watch.</P>
<P>While &s;he was lamenting her fate in being thus illegally confined, without be|ing guilty of the lea&s;t outrage, there was a knocking at the door of the round hou&s;e, which at fir&s;t elated her heart, hoping that her landlady might, from &s;u&s;picion of her being there, have &s;ent &s;ome per&s;on to her relief. But her joy was &s;oon turned into &s;orrow, for upon opening the door, her ears were &s;aluted with a volley of oaths from an elderly lady; who, &s;he af|terwards under&s;tood, &s;u&s;tained the ho|nourable character of a bawd. This good
<PB N="63" REF="65">
lady did not come unattended; one of her nymphs, with whom &s;he had charged the watch for detaining her property by force, had in her turn charged her for breaking the peace, and forcibly entering her apartments.</P>
<P>After &s;ome wrangle between them, the con&s;table told them, they had better &s;et|tle matters over a bottle, as it would only tend to their mutual di&s;advantage to go before the ju&s;tice in the morning. The young lady readily agreed to have not only one bottle, but half a dozen, &s;wearing, lu&s;tily, however, &s;he would not let that old b&mdash;h cheat her in the manner &s;he had done.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time, the con&s;table, the beadle, his wife, the bawd, and the nymph, jovially intoxicated them&s;elves, and by five in the morning were joining in the agree|able concert of their no&s;trils.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s ELLIOT might have made her e&s;|cape now, but as &s;he knew they could al|ledge nothing again&s;t her, and &s;he mu&s;t have expo&s;ed her&s;elf in the neighbourhood

by returning at that time in the morning&punc; &s;he remained till they awoke, in order to be conducted before a worthy magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>The vigilant guardians of the night having proclaimed the hour of &s;ix, retur|ned to depo&s;it their lanthorns and &s;taves, and the inebriate pri&s;oners and gue&s;ts be|gan to yawn for repo&s;e. It was too early to di&s;turb his wor&s;hip, and the generous nymph, who had &s;o bountifully &s;upplied them with wine, procured them coffee and tea for breakfa&s;t, of which our he|roine, after her fatigue, was ea&s;ily pre|vailed on to partake.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s ELLIOT had received &s;everal hints the former part of the evening, that by a proper pre&s;ent to the officer, &s;he might obtain her liberty; but, for urgent rea|&s;ons, &s;he was obliged to decline &s;uch an offer, though &s;he would gladly have pro|po&s;ed it, had it been in her power.</P>
<P>The worthy officers of the night now began to make the nece&s;&s;ary preparations for conducting the pri&s;oners to the magi|&s;trate; at who&s;e re&s;idence, when they ar|rived
<PB N="65" REF="67">
they remained &s;ome time in the anti|chamber, before they could gain admit|tance to his wor&s;hip's pre&s;ence. At length they received notice to appear before him; and the elderly lady, being an hou&s;e|keeper, was fir&s;t examined.</P>
<P>When the merits of her cau&s;e were heard, the ju&s;tice commanded her mitti|mus to be drawn, and her per&s;on con|veyed to the &s;ecure man&s;ion of Tothil. Her tears and &s;upplications on this occa|&s;ion were of no force at all; and &s;he was given to under&s;tand by his wor&s;hip, that he could &s;ee through tho&s;e crocodile artifi|ces, and was not to be impo&s;ed upon by fair &s;peeches; ordering his myrmidons to &s;ee her lodged in the apartment to which he had con&s;igned her</P>
<P>While the clerk was preparing her mit|timus, the gentleman came in who had been in her company the preceeding night, in order to make depo&s;ition of his having had his pocket picked of his watch. This gentleman declared upon oath, that there was nobody in the room but the bawd and his enamorata; upon which the arch
<PB N="66" REF="68">
hypocrite fell on her knees, and with art|ful tears prote&s;ted her innocence; but the ju&s;tice giving her a &s;ign, &s;he return|ed the watch, with which the owner re|tired contentedly, and the poor girl was committed.</P>
<P>Our heroine beheld with indignation this di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice, which permitted the guilty to e&s;cape with impunity, while the innocent &s;uffered the mo&s;t rigorous award; apprehending that &s;he her&s;elf might probably accompany the young lady to the hempen block. But the&s;e apprehen|&s;ions &s;oon &s;ub&s;ided, when Mrs. Lamb (an old gentlewoman perfectly well known to his wor&s;hip) appeared to vouch for her character; and &s;he being immediately &s;et at liberty, returned home with her bene|volent landlady.</P>
<P>Being arrived at her lodgings, &s;he could not forbear making &s;ome remarks on the late incident that had befallen her; as well as exclaiming again&s;t a mon&s;trous perver|&s;ion of law, which is daily practi&s;ed in our &s;treets; &s;eizing on per&s;ons who quiet|ly pa&s;s without offering the lea&s;t outrage

or mole&s;tation to any per&s;on. This &s;he thought could not be ju&s;tified on princi|ples of Engli&s;h liberty, which certainly permits the &s;ubject to pa&s;s unmole&s;ted at all hours, provided they infringe not the laws of peace, by di&s;turbing the inhabi|tants, or hara&s;&s;ing the pa&s;&s;engers. She al&s;o took notice, that, unle&s;s our zealous reformers found out &s;ome more effectual method of &s;topping the progre&s;s of vice, than that of &s;eizing on poor unhappy wo|men promi&s;cuou&s;ly, and con&s;igning them to the vile&s;t receptacles, where they were rendered more impudent, and which only &s;erved to harden them in &s;in, avaricious villains would pro&s;titute the &s;acred name of law, to countenance the gratification of their &s;ordid di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>The reader will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, that in all her troubles, her dear M&mdash;y, by who&s;e con&s;ent &s;he had admitted o|thers to a participation of the &s;ame fa|vours with which &s;he indulged him, ne|ver was in a condition to afford her any relief in all her di&s;tre&s;&s;es, or to contri|bute in the lea&s;t towards extricating her out of any difficulty &s;he fell into. She
<PB N="68" REF="70">
had therefore no re&s;ource le&s;t, but to form the be&s;t plan &s;he could in her former un|happy &s;tation in life.</P>
<P>Having now, by a cour&s;e of experience, acquired a competent knowledge of the world of intrigue, &s;he was now fully ac|compli&s;hed for &s;u&s;taining the character of a profe&s;&s;ed courtezan. She was indeed at pre&s;ent under the controul of Mrs. Lamb, to whom &s;he was indebted for the imme|diate means of her exi&s;tence, but &s;he &s;oon managed affairs &s;o well, as to free, her&s;elf from the trammels of that impo&s;ing mer|cenary wretch.</P>
<P>A variety of incidents had taught her the nece&s;&s;ity of a gaudy out&s;ide &s;hew, and a double tongue, in order to accompli&s;h the different &s;chemes of a woman of plea&s;ure; &s;o that &s;he became ver&s;ed in all the chi|canery that con&s;titutes experienced guilt. Her prevailing love of novelty rendered her a more agreeable companion to each &s;ucce&s;&s;ive cully; and prompted her to a behaviour that frequently extorted gratuities from that part of female ad|mirers,
<PB N="69" REF="71">
who prefer the giving to the re|ceiving of plea&s;ure in amorous encoun|ters.</P>
<P>Being enrolled in the li&s;t of the infamous pimp-ma&s;ter general, her a&s;&s;ignations be|came very frequent; and as &s;he now acted with an immediate view to pecuniary ad|vantage, her finances increa&s;ed, and en|abled her in a &s;hort time to di&s;charge Mrs. Lamb's debt, and once more embark in the world of gallantry on her own bottom.</P>
<P>Accordingly being well furni&s;hed with the nece&s;&s;ary apparatus of her profe&s;&s;ion, &s;he frequented the park, and the play; and rai&s;ed her&s;elf to a very high degree of emi|nence in the rank of female adventurers.</P>
<P>She had not long frequented the fa&s;hi|onable a&s;&s;emblies of the gay and polite, before &s;everal gentlemen declared them|&s;elves &s;mitten with her charms; though none paid their addre&s;&s;es to her on the &s;core of marriage, or made her any other over|tures than &s;ome cu&s;tomary remarks on her beauty.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="72">I mu&s;t here beg the readers pardon for a &s;hort digre&s;&s;ion, in order to give them &s;ome idea of what is meant by female ad|mirers. They may be con&s;idered, as com|po&s;ed of three cla&s;&s;es; viz. The honour|able, the di&s;honourable, and the negative or dangling, implying neither the one nor the other. The fir&s;t &s;et of admirers generally require not beauty alone in a lady, but &s;omething more durable, which is money; &s;en&s;ible that a de&s;titution of this nece&s;&s;ary ingredient in the portion of a wife always entails cares, and too often di&s;cord, that bane of the nuptial union. The &s;econd cla&s;s &s;eldom requires any other qualification in the fair one, than beauty; though wit is frequently deemed a very agreeable quality in a mi&s;tre&s;s, unle&s;s the lover is deficient in it him&s;elf, or imagines his charmer has too great a &s;hare, and con&s;equently di&s;tru&s;ts her employing it to bad purpo&s;es again&s;t him&s;elf. With re|&s;pect to the third &s;ort, called danglers, their vanity is rai&s;ed in proportion to the endowments po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Lady they profe&s;s to admire; and the&s;e generally may be gratified in their highe&s;t expec|tations, without prejudice to a woman's
<PB N="71" REF="73">
honour or virtue, provided &s;he is well a&s;|&s;ured that the per&s;on, who appears to be a mere dangler, is not in reality a hypocrite.</P>
<P>Now, though Mi&s;s ELLIOT &s;oon met with &s;everal of the latter cla&s;s of admir|ers, the cau&s;e cannot be a&s;&s;igned why &s;he had neither of the two former, till &s;ome time after her fir&s;t appearance in places of public re&s;ort; unle&s;s it may be attributed to the uncertainty of her for|tune among&s;t tho&s;e men of honour, who would have approved of her as a wife, or, to that which is more common, a tender|ne&s;s for her per&s;on and years, among tho&s;e rakes, who, though they could not reli&s;h matrimony, would gladly have embraced her as a mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Tired with a long and fruitle&s;s &s;earch after &s;ome lover, who was both able and willing to make her a hand&s;ome compen|&s;ation in return for her favours, &s;he one day took a &s;olitary walk in Ken&s;ington gardens. She &s;at down on a green bench, reclined her head on her arm, and was very thoughtful. She was much &s;urpri&s;ed by a gentleman's acco&s;ting her with,
<PB N="72" REF="74">
<Q>Pretty Mi&s;s, permit me the honour of &s;itting by you.</Q> She turned her head to &s;ee who it was that acco&s;ted her, and was agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed to find it was a per&s;on, who, by his air, &s;eemed entirely adapted to her purpo&s;e. She therefore, very politely de&s;ired him to &s;it down; and a few minutes conver&s;ation &s;o captivated his affection, that an interview was pre&s;ent|ly agreed on at her lodgings, to which &s;he gave him proper directions, and whither he repaired the following day in the after|noon.</P>
<P>This new lover was no other than com|modore H&mdash;y, nephew to the right honourable l&mdash; B&mdash;; he was &s;o highly charmed with her conver&s;ation at this fir&s;t vi&s;it, that he &s;taid all night with her, and, before they parted, ea&s;ily gained her con&s;ent to live with him as a mi&s;tre&s;s; and accordingly &s;ettled on her an annuity of 500 l. per annum, pre&s;enting her at the &s;ame time with a gold watch and a dia|mond necklace.</P>
<P>No woman, in Mi&s;s ELLIOT'S way of life, ever lived more happy or content than
<PB N="73" REF="75">
&s;he did for two years that &s;he was in keep|ing with this gentleman. He was pa&s;&s;ion|ately fond of her, and was continually racking his invention to find out new ways of plea&s;ing her. She was &s;ole mi&s;tre&s;s of his hou&s;e, regarded by all the &s;ervants as their mi&s;tre&s;s; and they were told by the commodore, that whatever Mi&s;s EL|LIOT ordered them to do, was to be com|plied with as punctually as though he him&s;elf had commanded it.</P>
<P>Our heroine, who now moved in a higher &s;phere than &s;he had ever done be|fore, was care&s;&s;ed by all the commo|dore's friends and acquaintance, who all &s;eemed to take a plea&s;ure in daily giving her fre&s;h proofs of their friend&s;hip and e&s;teem. She was envied by all her ac|quaintance, both male and female: by the men, who lamented their cruel de&s;tiny that denied the enjoyment of her ador|able per&s;on; and by women of her own &s;tamp, who often &s;ighed to experience the &s;ame happine&s;s &s;he enjoyed.</P>
<P>About this time her &s;i&s;ter FANNY, who had unluckily made a fal&s;e &s;tep at Tun|bridge,
<PB N="74" REF="76">
came to London, in hopes of pro|curing a genteel livelihood by the traffic of tho&s;e charms which nature had be&s;tow|ed on her almo&s;t with as much profu&s;ion as on Mi&s;s ELLIOT. She had not been in London above a fortnight, before &s;he was taken notice of by Mr. &mdash;, ma&s;ter of the G&mdash;n c&mdash;&s;s Inn at Charing-cro&s;s, on whom her beauty made &s;o deep an im|pre&s;&s;ion, that having learned the place of her abode, he vi&s;ited her; and being e|qually charmed with her good &s;en&s;e, and engaging conver&s;ation, he determined to take her home to live with him: which offer (being di&s;engaged from any other lover) &s;he accepted of with the greate&s;t joy.</P>
<P>She did not, however, long enjoy her pre&s;ent good fortune; for being di&s;cover|ed to have been a little too free with one of the waiters, &s;he was immediately di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed from the hou&s;e of her keeper, who loaded her with reproaches for her infide|lity to him.</P>
<P>She immediately had recour&s;e to Mi&s;s ELLIOT, who &s;eeing her di&s;tre&s;s, allowed
<PB N="75" REF="77">
her a weekly &s;tipend, &s;ufficient to keep her hand&s;omely; and at the &s;ame time undertook the arduous, though plea&s;ing ta&s;k of in&s;tructing her in all the my&s;teries of a courtezan; and &s;he had the &s;atisfac|tion to find, that her &s;i&s;ter proved a very apt &s;cholar. When &s;he imagined her &s;uf|ficiently qualified, &s;he re&s;olved to &s;et her up in bu&s;ine&s;s, in a manner which &s;hould at the fir&s;t &s;et her above the common level of tho&s;e ladies who&s;e bread depends on their beautiful per&s;ons; and to that end hired a very hand&s;ome hou&s;e in Northum|berland-&s;treet, mo&s;t elegantly furni&s;hed; &s;he &s;upplied her with the hand&s;ome&s;t clothes her wardrobe afforded, gave her a very hand&s;ome gold watch, and made her a pre&s;ent of a bank note of fifty pounds.</P>
<P>Thus equipped, Mi&s;s ELLIOT'S &s;i&s;ter be|gan to live in great &s;plendor; and by fol|lowing the directions given her for her conduct, &s;oon had the &s;atisfaction of &s;ee|ing her&s;elf &s;urrounded by many lovers, who were all of them per&s;ons who&s;e pur&s;es were as open to her extravagant demands, as their hearts were to her tran&s;cendent
<PB N="76" REF="78">
beauty. She was completely ble&s;&s;ed; but, alas! &s;he was ignorant of her great hap|pine&s;s, which cau&s;ed it to be of very &s;hort duration.</P>
<P>There was a French hair-dre&s;&s;er, who lived in the Strand, and who being often &s;ent for to contribute what he could to &s;et her off to the be&s;t advantage, had &s;ome|times ventured to expre&s;s his pa&s;&s;ion for her; at the &s;ame time lamenting that the meanne&s;s of his profe&s;&s;ion debarred him from the hope of ever arriving at the &s;u|preme happine&s;s of enjoying her &s;weet per|&s;on. She li&s;tened to his bomba&s;tic oratory with a plea&s;ure which it was out of her power to conceal; and he catching the opportunity, pre&s;&s;ed her &s;o hard, that un|able any longer to re&s;i&s;t, &s;he con&s;ented; and Mon&s;. Frizeur from that hour re|doubled his former diligence in attending on her; and there &s;carce pa&s;&s;ed a day on which they were not privately together.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s ELLIOT was &s;oon acquainted with the intrigue her &s;i&s;ter carried on with the French barber: it excited her indignation to the highe&s;t degree: &s;he &s;ent for her &s;i&s;|ter;
<PB N="77" REF="79">
and when &s;he came, reproached her in the &s;evere&s;t terms, for the mean &s;pirit &s;he betrayed in admitting to her embraces &s;o abject a wretch as Frizeur; and forbade her, on pain of her irreconcileable hatred, ever to &s;ee him again.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s ELLIOT'S &s;i&s;ter, who trembled at the thoughts of incurring her benefactre&s;s's di&s;plea&s;ure, promi&s;ed never more to admit of his vi&s;its; though, as &s;he was &s;o pa&s;|&s;ionately in love with him, &s;he was di|&s;tracted to think &s;he mu&s;t never &s;ee him more; and therefore employed her thoughts to find out a way of &s;eeing him unknown to our heroine. In this &s;he &s;ucceeded even beyond her wi&s;hes for &s;ome time, till at length her amour with the barber became &s;o public as to reflect even &s;hame and &s;can|dal on her&s;elf and her &s;i&s;ter. Mi&s;s ELLIOT then tried every method her prudence could &s;ugge&s;t to break off their intima|cy, but to little purpo&s;e; for her &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion for mon&s;ieur was uncon|querable, having previou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed of all her furniture, clothes, and every other valuable thing given to her by our he|roine, decamped with her lover, to the
<PB N="78" REF="80">
no &s;mall grief of her &s;i&s;ter, who found her&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of making good to the landlord the lo&s;s of his goods, which had been &s;old to rai&s;e the money nece&s;&s;ary for the elopement of Mi&s;s EL|LIOT'S &s;i&s;ter with the Frenchman.</P>
<P>Our heroine, who was of that happy turn of mind, that nothing could long give her unea&s;ine&s;s, &s;oon forgot this unlucky affair, and rea&s;&s;umed her gaiety. Her lover was fond of her to di&s;traction, and &s;he took care by the practice of all tho&s;e endearing arts of which the fair &s;ex are &s;o well fur|ni&s;hed, to encrea&s;e the love he had for her. Thus they continued happy beyond de&s;cription in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of each other for about two years, when Mi&s;s ELLIOT, by a mo&s;t unpardonable act of impru|dence, incurred the di&s;plea&s;ure of the com|modore &s;o much, that he ordered her to leave his hou&s;e in the mo&s;t abrupt manner, and could never be prevailed on to have any other connexions with her.</P>
<P>H&mdash;y's valet de chambre, a fellow of a good per&s;on and genteel addre&s;s, had long a&s;pired to the honour of being en|rolled
<PB N="79" REF="81">
in the li&s;t of her admirers; he &s;igh|ed in vain many times to ta&s;te the am|bro&s;ial nectar, which di&s;tilled from her coral lips, and he never attended in her apartment to dre&s;s her hair, which was his daily occupation, but he experienced the flame of love burning in his brea&s;t with &s;o much the more impetuo&s;ity, as he was obliged to keep it pent up without betraying the lea&s;t &s;ign of it, for fear of a repul&s;e from the cruel fair; who, perhaps enraged at his pre&s;umption, might have told the commodore, and he thereby have been di&s;charged from his place. In this however he was mi&s;taken, for Mi&s;s ELLIOT, who&s;e firme&s;t principle was, that variety is the &s;oul of plea&s;ure, &s;eeing his di&s;tre&s;s, kindly relieved his pain, by tell|ing him &s;he was re&s;olved to reward his pa&s;&s;ion with a &s;uitable return of love; and from that hour, they often enjoyed each o|thers company when her keeper was ab&s;ent.</P>
<P>This agreeable corre&s;pondence however did not long &s;ub&s;i&s;t. The valet, who was naturally of a hot fiery di&s;po&s;ition, having had &s;ome words with one of the footmen
<PB N="80" REF="82">
a blackamoor, the Indian, out of re|venge for having been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> by our heroine's new lover, determ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> acquaint his ma&s;ter with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which was carrying on between his fellow &s;ervant and Mi&s;&s; ELLIOT: which he did; exaggera|ting the mo&s;t minute circum&s;tance to the highe&s;t aggravation of their guilt. The i&s;&s;ue was, that the valet, having received his wages, was kicked out of doors; and the lady ordered to decamp, without be|ing even permitted to take any more clothes than what were barely &s;ufficient for her pre&s;ent u&s;e.</P>
<P>The reader is to be informed (and I hope he will excu&s;e the omi&s;&s;ion, as pro|ceeding more from inadvertency than any other cau&s;e) that when Mi&s;s ELLIOT quit|ted the Engli&s;h &s;tage, &s;he found her&s;elf in|volved in a variety of debts, which &s;he was unable to di&s;charge, notwith&s;tanding her income was greater than ever &s;he could have rea&s;onably expected; and therefore, in order to avoid the in&s;olent importunities of her creditors, &s;he judged it advi&s;eable to make a trip to Dublin, having previou&s;|ly obtained a &s;ettlement from the managers of the theatre there.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="83">She did not however remain long there; and on her return to England, finding it impo&s;&s;ible to wre&s;t the capital parts from tho&s;e actre&s;&s;es who had long enjoyed them by theatrical pre&s;cription, &s;he li&s;t|ened to the addre&s;&s;es of the honour|able Mr. H&mdash;y, who engaged, by his connexions and intere&s;t, to carry every point &s;he propo&s;ed. In this however &s;he found her&s;elf mi&s;taken: for though this gentleman exerted all his influence in her favour, the managers were not convinced that &s;he had talents for tho&s;e &s;uperior parts, or that &s;he was &s;o improved, as to entitle her to preclude the performers who then filled them to the general &s;atis|faction of the town. Di&s;gu&s;ted with their behaviour, he obliged her to quit the &s;tage, and tru&s;t for her &s;upport to his fortune and affection; which la&s;t &s;oon began to waver, when he found him&s;elf obliged to maintain a woman, who con&s;idered her abandoning the &s;tage as a great &s;acrifice; and expected in return many conce&s;&s;ions and indulgencies. Mutual coolne&s;s &s;uc|ceeded, and jealou&s;y, confirmed after|wards by the &s;tronge&s;t conviction of her guilt, was the cau&s;e of their &s;eparation; and his mi&s;tre&s;s, and valet de chambre
<PB N="82" REF="84">
were di&s;mi&s;ed together, as we have already &s;een.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this &s;troke of adver&s;e fortune, &s;he &s;till ro&s;e higher from the re|bound. She remained, however, for &s;ome time in an ob&s;cure &s;tate; and though &s;he did not publicly walk the &s;treets as before, yet &s;he had a &s;et of con&s;tant cu&s;tomers, who either vi&s;ited her at her own lodgings, or el&s;e &s;ent for her to &s;ome tavern or bagnio. This flow of bu&s;ine&s;s, though, if I may be allowed the ex|pre&s;&s;ion, only in the retail way, enabled her to live comfortably, and by degrees encrea&s;e her little &s;tock of clothes, with|out being forced to run in debt for them. In proportion, as her wardrobe became more valuable, her trade increa&s;ed; and being at length able to appear with &s;ome degree of propriety in a &s;ide box, &s;he did not fail of making many valuable con|que&s;ts: adver&s;ity, the be&s;t mi&s;tre&s;s of fru|gality, having &s;hewed the inconveniences re&s;ulting from extravagance, made her now regulate her expences within the bounds of moderation.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="85">Being now able to a&s;&s;ume the appear|ance of a woman of condition, &s;he en|deavoured to draw in &s;ome unexperienced youth in the way of marriage; or at lea&s;t to procure an advantageous &s;ettlement from &s;ome rich cully. Pur&s;uant to this plan, &s;he frequented all public places; but to her great grief, &s;he &s;oon found that &s;he was too well known to hope for &s;ucce&s;s in the former way, and therefore wi&s;ely con|fined her de&s;ires to the latter. In this &s;he &s;ucceeded, and was taken into keeping by a certain rich Jew, (who&s;e name, for par|ticular rea&s;ons, we judge proper to con|ceal,) to whom &s;he had no objection, but his advanced age and peculiar religion; but his wealth over-ballanced all the&s;e con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the general obloquy and reproach under which this people lies, &s;he found her keeper to be a very worthy man, and was greatly plea&s;ed with her &s;ituation, becau&s;e he was &s;o much en|gaged in bu&s;ine&s;s, that he had not an op|portunity of taking notice of the frequent infidelities &s;he was guilty of towards him.</P>

<P>Her keeper being obliged to go to Hol|land about his affairs, and having given her to under&s;tand that he did not expect to return in le&s;s than a month, &s;he was overjoyed at the intelligence; but &s;he was &s;o much mi&s;tre&s;s of the art of di&s;&s;embling (an art full as nece&s;&s;ary in a kept mi&s;tre&s;s as a courtier) that &s;he expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t concern at parting, and went &s;o far as to &s;hed tears.</P>

<P>She lived with him till the time of his death, which happened about two years after, when &s;he was again obliged to look out for a new keeper.</P>
<P>The life of a kept mi&s;tre&s;s is con&s;tantly ebbing and flowing, &s;ubject to perpetual vici&s;&s;itudes, and &s;o many &s;cenes of compli|cated woe, that were is not for that infal|lible remedy the bottle, &s;o many could not be deluded by fanta&s;tic pro&s;pects, and airy expectations, into an aby&s;s of mi&s;ery and de&s;pair.

<P>As our heroine was very fortunate, &s;he was taken into keeping by Mr. G&mdash;, a game&s;ter, who took a genteel lodging near Leice&s;ter-fields, where they lived in a very elegant manner. She lived with Mr. G&mdash; very agreeable for &s;ome months, a&s;&s;ured that her lover was a man of for|tune
<PB N="87" REF="88">
as they lived in a &s;plendor that could not be &s;upported at a &s;mall expence: But Mr. G&mdash; &s;uddenly di&s;appeared, and poor Mi&s;s ELLIOT was arre&s;ted by the landlady for board and lodging, and conveyed to the Fleet, the too frequent re&s;idence of whores and authors.</P>
<P>The confined life of a jail appeared very tedious and in&s;ipid to a woman of our he|roine's &s;prightly di&s;po&s;ition, but &s;he had not langui&s;hed a con&s;iderable time, till good fortune &s;ent her a companion capable of alleviating the unea&s;ine&s;s of her &s;ituation.</P>
<P>A gentleman was brought to pri&s;on, who, though too far advanced in years to be amiable, had a very genteel per&s;on; and there was &s;omething extremely enga|ing and agreeable in his conver&s;ation. It was very lucky that &s;he met with this new acquaintance, but her happine&s;s received a con&s;iderable addition, when a &s;ervant in livery one morning brought him a letter, by which he received intelligence, that a friend of his had advanced the &s;um in que&s;tion, and that he &s;hould be &s;et at li|berty that very day: Mr. F&mdash; was

overjoyed at the news: and Mi&s;s ELLIOT had no le&s;s rea&s;on to be &s;o, as he had pro|po&s;ed to take her home as &s;oon as he was relea&s;ed.</P>
<P>She regained her liberty the &s;ame day as Mr. F&mdash;, with whom &s;he lived in great tranquillity, e&s;teeming this the hap|pie&s;t part of her life; for though the &s;en|&s;ual enjoyments were not &s;o &s;trong in her lover, &s;he was free from tho&s;e inquietudes that ever attend the &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion of jea|lou&s;y, with which the minds of &s;ome of her keepers had been infe&s;ted.</P>
<P>In about four years Mr. F&mdash; died, having &s;ettled an unnuity of forty pounds <HI>per annum</HI> on his dear Nancy. With this income &s;he propo&s;ed &s;ettling in &s;ome way of bu&s;ine&s;s, which the bounty of her keeper had enabled her to do. Her intention, however, was &s;oon diverted from this re&s;olution, by a new acquain|tance which &s;he made a &s;hort time after, and which intercour&s;e paved the way to a &s;tate, to which her mo&s;t exalted expec|tations could never have a&s;pired.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="90">Being once more to be di&s;po&s;ed of in the auction of love, and as her annuity made her able to pre&s;erve her con&s;equence, none dared to approach the &s;pot, where &s;he di&s;pen&s;ed her charms, but tho&s;e who were amply furni&s;hed with the all-pre|vailing metal.</P>
<P>At this juncture, Sir George B&mdash;, re|turned from his travels, and had not been in town two days before he was &s;topped, by a livery &s;ervant, in Bond-&s;treet, who told him, that his lady de&s;ired to &s;peak with him. His &s;urpri&s;e was very great on this occa&s;ion, but much greater, when on enquiry he found that &s;he who had &s;ent him that polite me&s;&s;age, was no other than the celebrated Mi&s;s ELLIOT, who&s;e &s;ame had reached his ears. After innumerable prote&s;tations of love, he a&s;k|ed her if &s;he was content to live with him as a mi&s;tre&s;s; and &s;he con&s;enting, filled him with inexpre&s;&s;ible joy and delight.</P>
<P>She now thought of devoting her&s;elf to the per&s;on of her lover alone, and he was equally happy and content in the em|braces of a woman he e&s;teemed before her
<PB N="89" REF="91">
whole &s;ex. They lived together about &s;ix months in all the endearments of mutual affection, when Sir George was informed, by a letter, of the decea&s;e of his brother abroad; and of his having left him &s;ole executor to an e&s;tate of immen&s;e value. A &s;eparation hereby became unavoidably nece&s;&s;ary; &s;o that Mi&s;s ELLIOT &s;oon part|ed with the only man &s;he loved, but not without receiving from him manife&s;t to|kens of his affection and genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>There came to England, with Sir George, a young gentleman of fortune, who&s;e name was Ed&mdash;ds, very amorous, but very petulant. He had often ob&s;erved our he|roine, on his vi&s;its to Sir George, with an eye of de&s;ire; and judging his ab&s;ence a very convenient opportunity for making known his opinion of her, he wrote to her, and inclo&s;ed a double piece of paper in the letter, which being a pregnant proof of his genero&s;ity, procured him a vi&s;it, as did a repeated pre&s;ent the de&s;ired fa|vour.</P>
<P>Young Ed&mdash;ds was the riche&s;t of all her admirers under the rank of nobility;
<PB N="91" REF="92">
and Mi&s;s ELLIOT, availing her&s;elf of his extraordinary fondne&s;s, obtained from him very con&s;iderable, as well as very frequent draughts; and by that means lived as ele|gant as any woman in the whole city. Tho&s;e who are acquainted with the pride of the human heart, will not be at all &s;ur|pri&s;ed, when they hear that our heroine was now as much the envy of the women, as &s;he was the admiration of the men. The latter thought the charms of the whole &s;ex centered in the amiable Mi&s;s ELLIOT; while the former invented num|berle&s;s a&s;per&s;ions to villify her character; repre&s;enting her vanity as unparalleled, her pride as in&s;upportable, and her avarice as in&s;atiable.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the calumny of her &s;ex, which aro&s;e from the mo&s;t inveterate envy to our heroine, who &s;upplanted mo&s;t of them in the admiration of the men, by the &s;plendor of her appearance, &s;he had many adorers, and met with divers adventures, no le&s;s extraordinary than entertaining.</P>
<P>A certain noble lord, who&s;e marriage being of &s;ome years &s;tanding, was grown.
<PB N="90" REF="93">
weary of the embraces of his lady, though a woman of very amiable accompli&s;hments both of mind and per&s;on, imagining he &s;aw in Mi&s;s ELLIOT qualities that would excite &s;en&s;ations &s;uperior to any he had hitherto experienced, found means to pro|cure a vi&s;it, and would have abruptly open|ed his de&s;ign, had he not di&s;covered, from the re&s;erved manner of her behaviour, that &s;ome degree of ceremony was requi&s;ite by way of prelude.</P>
<P>He &s;ubmitted to the cu&s;tom &s;he im|po&s;ed; and after two hours di&s;tant con|ference took his leave: but, on the &s;e|cond vi&s;it, he pre&s;ented her with a gold &s;nuff-box, containing a very valuable com|modity, which prevented any farther re|mon&s;trances on her part. However, &s;he informed him, &s;he was engaged all the week with Mr. Ed&mdash;ds, and would be at his &s;ervice at the expiration of that time. The appointed period being come, his lord&s;hip waited on her, and pre&s;ented her with a diamond ring, with which &s;he &s;eemed extremely &s;atisfied. He pa&s;&s;ed the evening with her, and was &s;o enraptured with her company, that he not only prote&s;|ted
<PB N="92" REF="94">
he had never been &s;o happy in his life, but repeated his vi&s;its every other day for a month, when he made her very hand|&s;ome pre&s;ents, and &s;he made him the &s;a|tisfactory returns.</P>
<P>During her interviews with this noble lord, &s;he had received from him, when ca&s;h run &s;hort, jewels to a con&s;iderable amount. In the&s;e &s;he appeared at the play, &s;itting very near to the lady of her noble keeper, who&s;e mo&s;t magnificent ap|paratus of dre&s;s being di&s;po&s;ed of to &s;up|port the extravagance of her lord, &s;he had nothing but pa&s;te ornaments about her; and therefore, ob&s;erving her own diamonds on a celebrated courtezan, was &s;o exce&s;|&s;ively, and indeed ju&s;tly chagrined, that &s;he left the play-hou&s;e before the repre|&s;entation was concluded.</P>
<P>This adventure was &s;ucceeded by ano|ther, that gratified the &s;pleen and envy of the malicious part of the &s;ex for &s;ome days. Mi&s;s ELLIOT was riding one morn|ing in Hyde-Park for the benefit of the air, in compliance with the cu&s;tom of the
<PB N="93" REF="95">
<HI>bean mende,</HI> when her hor&s;e, taking fright, ran away with her. A group of beaux pre&s;ently came to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and our heroine being ri&s;en from the ground, found &s;he had a violent pain in her right hip; on which a chair being &s;ent for, &s;he was conveyed home. To this accident alone, as we &s;hall &s;ee in the &s;equel, &s;he owed all her future good fortune.</P>
<P>When &s;he came home &s;he was put to bed, and a &s;urgeon being &s;ent for, he gave it as his opinion, that the hurt &s;he had re|ceived was far from being dangerous, and that if proper care were taken of her, &s;he might, after a dew days, appear again in public as before this accident happened to her.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the gentlemen who were pre|&s;ent when &s;he received the accident, there was one who &s;eemed more atten|tive than all the re&s;t to lend her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He was no other than the D&mdash; of C&mdash;, who having learned the place of her abode, re&s;olved to vi&s;it her as &s;oon as &s;he was able to receive company.
<PB N="94" REF="96">
He therefore &s;ent her &s;everal polite me&s;|&s;ages, &s;ignifying the great de&s;ire he had of being farther acquainted with her, and his intention of coming to &s;ee her as &s;oon as ever her pre&s;ent indi&s;po&s;ition would al|low her to receive vi&s;its.</P>
<P>She, who was overjoyed at the thoughts of being taken notice of by &s;o re&s;pect|able a per&s;onage, returned an&s;wers &s;uit|able to the letters &s;he received; and, at his de&s;ire, appointed a day when it would be mo&s;t convenient for him to come to &s;ee her. He obeyed the &s;um|mons; and this fir&s;t interview engaged her &s;o deeply in his affections, that he took her immediately into keeping, on condition of her laying a&s;ide all thoughts of appearing any more on the &s;tage, for which &s;he &s;till entertained a very great inclination, though four years were now elap&s;ed &s;ince &s;he had quitted the theatre. He hired a very fine hou&s;e for her in Greek Street, near Soho Square, and furni&s;hed it in the mo&s;t magnificent manner, and made a &s;ettlement on her of fifteen hun|dred pounds per annum; and, in &s;hort, treated her with &s;o much affection, that &s;he
<PB N="95" REF="97">
had rea&s;on to congratulate her&s;elf on the unexpected happine&s;s &s;he now enjoyed.</P>
<P>Our heroine exerted all her powers to plea&s;e and amu&s;e her lover. They pa&s;&s;ed their time in the enjoyment of the mo&s;t rational amu&s;ements, and &s;he was careful to employ every art &s;he was mi&s;tre&s;s of to in|crea&s;e his love for her. She read to him the beauties of the Engli&s;h cla&s;&s;ics, and par|ticularly Milton, &s;o emphatically as gave him the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction. She pointed out the mo&s;t &s;triking pa&s;&s;ages with &s;o much nicety of judgment, as rai&s;ed his wonder, that a woman &s;hould be able to di&s;cover the&s;e beauties which had eluded the mo&s;t diligent re&s;earches of the able&s;t writers: &s;he engaged in his hunting parties, and entered into the &s;pirit of all the amu&s;e|ments her &s;wain admired, and which he was plea&s;ed to find his mi&s;tre&s;s approved. Nay, &s;o great was her &s;kill in hor&s;eman|&s;hip, that one who had more wit than good nature ob&s;erved, that, <Q>&s;he leaped over the five barred gates with as little ceremony as &s;he had formely vaulted over the mounds of virtue and di&s;cre|tion.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="98">Mi&s;s ELLIOT's lover grew &s;o fond of her as not to be able to refu&s;e her any thing that &s;he a&s;ked of him, while he was lo&s;t in the &s;weet ely&s;ium of bli&s;s; and &s;he did not forget to avail her&s;elf of the fa|cility of his temper, by ama&s;&s;ing &s;uch a|mazing quantities of rich clothes and trinkets, as were altogether a&s;toni&s;hing. Thus &s;he lived in one continued round of plea&s;ure, without once de&s;iring to wake from the golden dream.</P>
<P>She had lived in this agreeable manner about a year and a half, when her happi|ne&s;s was interrupted by her lover's being obliged to quit her &s;oft embraces for a time, and go on an expedition to the Mediterranean; for which a fleet was &s;it|ting out, to &s;ail in a &s;hort time. This rever&s;e of fortune &s;he u&s;ed her utmo&s;t endeavours to bear with all the philo&s;ophy &s;he was mi&s;tre&s;s of. She re&s;olved to try the force of his affection for her, by draw|ing him in to make her &s;ome pre&s;ent, which &s;hould amply make up for the lo&s;s &s;he &s;hould &s;u&s;tain by his ab&s;ence, and which al&s;o would be a &s;ort of provi&s;ion
<PB N="97" REF="99">
for her in ca&s;e he either never returned, or, being tired of her, &s;hould fix his heart on &s;ome other lady. In order to effect her &s;cheme, one evening, when he was merrier than u&s;ual, &s;he propo&s;ed to him that he &s;hould &s;ub&s;cribe his name to a paper &s;he had prepared, intitling her to an annuity of a thou&s;and pounds in ca&s;e any accident &s;hould befall him. She did not however &s;ucceed in this attempt. He treated the paper with the contempt it merited, and told his mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he mu&s;t devi&s;e &s;ome other method to excite his genero&s;ity, than that of making her own terms, when &s;he ought to leave that entirely to him. He &s;aid he had already determined on the &s;um he intended to give, and order|ed her never more to urge him on that head.</P>
<P>He then pre&s;ented her with three bank notes of a thou&s;and pounds each; pro|mi&s;ing her, at the &s;ame time, that if &s;he continued faithful to him during his ab|&s;ence, he would, at his return, reward her con&s;tancy in a manner far beyond her expectation. He farther a&s;&s;ured her, that nothing &s;hould ever make him forget her,
<PB N="98" REF="100">
and that while they both lived, he was firmly re&s;olved not to take any other wo|man to his arms as long as her behaviour continued to be &s;uch as it ought to be.</P>
<P>Our heroine, who perceived the wrong &s;tep &s;he had taken, and which, if the D&mdash; had not been &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately fond of her, might have proved fatal, excu&s;ed her&s;elf in the be&s;t manner &s;he could, and he re-a&s;&s;umed his former good humour. From this time, till he embarked on &s;hip board, he was very &s;eldom ab&s;ent. At length, the hour of his departure arrived, and he left his dear mi&s;tre&s;s, who pre|tended to be incon&s;olable on account of their &s;eparation.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only mention one or two of her intrigues while the D&mdash; was ab&s;ent; becau&s;e, although &s;he received vi&s;its from &s;everal others, yet none of her adventures with them are &s;o intere&s;ting as to de&s;erve a place in this hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t gentleman who had any con|nections with her after the D&mdash; left England, was a captain of a man of war
<PB N="99" REF="101">
named R&mdash;n. Although he expre&s;&s;ed great fondne&s;s for her, yet he was very far from exciting her affection in &s;o high a degree, as her la&s;t lover. He was a man, who, when his pa&s;&s;ion was once gratified, &s;en&s;ibly grew cooler in his love, and he became at la&s;t &s;o indifferent, and vi&s;ited her &s;o &s;eldom, that it was plain his fickle temper could not be long &s;atisfied with the enjoyment of the &s;ame per&s;on. Hav|ing nothing el&s;e to depend on but his pay he could not an&s;wer all her extravagant demands; which proved, after a &s;hort in|tercour&s;e, the cau&s;e of their final &s;epara|tion.</P>
<P>But to proceed in order. Being now left to her&s;elf, &s;he was &s;oon &s;urrounded by the &s;ame circle of admirers as before, though none made &s;o &s;en&s;ible an impre&s;|&s;ion on her heart as Capt. S&mdash;D&mdash;RS, a gen|tleman, who&s;e vivacity and good breeding rendered him much re&s;pected by all his acquaintance, as well as a general favour|ite with the ladies. The captain, being enamoured of our heroine, took every opportunity of being in her company alone, nor was &s;he backward in complying with
<PB N="100" REF="102">
his inclination in this re&s;pect, &s;ince the &s;hort intercour&s;es thus obtained, yielded much greater &s;atisfaction than a mixed company could give.</P>
<P>He had, however, the di&s;cretion to ad|dre&s;s her only as a former acquaintance, whenever he found &s;he was engaged with other company; and the lady had know|ledge enough of the world to an&s;wer him in the &s;ame manner: and their intimacy was kept up with &s;o much art, that one Mr. THOMPSON who kept her company at the &s;ame time, and who was of &s;o jealous a temper, that he boiled with rage if &s;he &s;poked to or looked at any other man, ap|peared free from all &s;u&s;picion of the cap|tain, though the change in her was &s;o ap|parent, as might have been ob&s;ervable by one le&s;s jealous. Her eyes became ani|mated, her complexion glowed, &s;he &s;poke with ea&s;e, and her whole air was changed when in the captain's company.</P>
<P>On the other hand the captain was ex|tremely cautious in his conduct towards her: which, as it laid him under great re|&s;traint, he thought de&s;erved to be reward|ed
<PB N="101" REF="103">
by &s;ome private interviews, wherein they might have the plea&s;ure of &s;ecurely gratifying their mutually ardent pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>To this her fears of a di&s;covery made &s;ome objection; nor was &s;he without ap|prehen&s;ions from the imprudence of his pa&s;&s;ion, which &s;he thought her own was too violent to repre&s;s. At length, how|ever, he prevailed; and as it was not very difficult to bring about, a time and place were accordingly appointed.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t private interview brought on a &s;econd, a &s;econd a third, and &s;o on, until they became 'almo&s;t daily; the thoughts of danger vani&s;hed from her, and &s;he gave a loo&s;e to her mo&s;t animated de&s;ires, re|velling in all the ec&s;ta&s;ies of a boundle&s;s affection, and receiving the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible tokens of love from her admired captain, that youth and vigour could po&s;&s;ibly af|ford.</P>
<P>The&s;e private meetings enabled the lovers the better to re&s;train them&s;elves in public company, and they had the &s;atis|faction of continuing their cour&s;e un|&s;u&s;pected,
<PB N="102" REF="104">
faction of continuing their cour&s;e un&s;u&s;|pected, till one night a maid &s;ervant of Mr. Thomp&s;on pa&s;&s;ed by, ju&s;t as &s;he came out of the captain's lodging, and vi&s;ibly ob&s;erved her. Her fright at this accident was &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that &s;he could not &s;up|port her&s;elf, and &s;he was obliged to return with the captain to his lodgings, till &s;he was well enough recovered to walk.</P>
<P>On her return to her own apartment, &s;he found Mr. Thomp&s;on had been ac|quainted with the affair; though &s;he was poorly provided with an apology, it was no part of her misfortune, that he would not give her an opportunity to de|fend her&s;elf. His abu&s;e de&s;cended to e|very infamous appellation, and he order|ed her, in a very imperious tone, to depart from his hou&s;e, which &s;he immediately did, and &s;ent notice of it directly to cap|tain S&mdash;d&mdash;rs, and begged to hear from him as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The following evening &s;he heard a footman coming up &s;tairs, who, to her inexpre&s;&s;ible joy, put a note into her hands from the captain, who promi&s;ed to wait
<PB N="103" REF="105">
on her the next morning. The plea&s;ure &s;he received on this occa&s;ion was &s;o great, that &s;he could hardly conceal it from the &s;ervant who brought it, and who waited for an an&s;wer; much le&s;s could &s;he com|po&s;e her&s;elf &s;o as to read it directly. At length, after a little recollection, &s;he found that theCapt. told her in it, that his appre|hen&s;ions for her had given him the great|e&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s; that he would &s;oon &s;ee her and order matters &s;o as to put her in a place where &s;he would be &s;afe from any future in&s;ult &s;he might apprehend from the jealou&s;y of Mr. Thomp&s;on.</P>
<P>This gave her new courage; and the following evening he came to her lodg|ings in a po&s;t-chai&s;e, in which they &s;et out for Bath; and relays of fre&s;h|hor&s;es being provided at the different &s;tages, they arrived the next day at Bath.</P>
<P>Here the captain provided genteel lodg|ings for her; and the people with whom &s;he lodged regarded her as a per&s;on of quality, rather than, what &s;he in fact was, a woman of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="106">In this &s;tate &s;he continued near two months; when her lover received orders for a cruize in the Mediteranean.

He was however &s;oon tired of this profu&s;e way of be&s;towing his favours, and he at la&s;t re|&s;olved to abandon her entirely on that ac|count: which he did by giving her to un|der&s;tand, that the la&s;t favour &s;he was to expect from him, was what was enclo&s;ed in the billet he &s;ent her, namely, a five hundred pounds bank note.</P>
<P>Being thus abandoned, the fir&s;t lover that pre&s;ented him&s;elf at the &s;hrine of her beauty, was the count de Guerchy. This gentleman, by birth a Frenchman, was the more agreeable to Mi&s;s ELLIOT, as his complai&s;ance flattered her pride, and the great encomiums he pa&s;&s;ed on her beau|ty. He made a long introduction to her on the &s;ubject of her wealth; and having harrangued a long while on that &s;ubject, he a&s;&s;ured her, he had no other in|tention,
<PB N="106" REF="108">
than to make her eternally hap|py; and even went &s;o far as to offer marriage, provided &s;he was willing to ac|cept of him as a hu&s;band. This &s;he ab|&s;olutely refu&s;ed, but &s;uffered him to court her as clo&s;e and a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly as if he had been wooing her to matrimony: he made &s;everal valuable pre&s;ents, which &s;he &s;uffer|ed her&s;elf to be prevailed on to accept, though not without great difficulty.</P>
<P>Gradually &s;he &s;uffered all his other im|portunities; and when he made a propo|&s;al of a compliment or appointment to her for a &s;ettlement, he &s;aid, there was not le&s;s due from him, to acknowledge the favours he received, than if our heroine had been in the greate&s;t nece&s;&s;ity. He added, he would make her life perfectly ea&s;y, by do|ing every thing in his power to plea&s;e her; and immediately &s;igned a paper which in|titled her to 500l. a year.</P>
<P>Thus they lived happy in the enjoy|ment of each other about nine months, during which time Mi&s;s ELLIOT had &s;eve|ral other private intrigues; particularly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> captain R&mdash;rts, who was doatingly
<PB N="107" REF="109">
fond of her, and made her many valuable pre&s;ents. This intercour&s;e with the cap|tain drew on her the re&s;entment of a young lady, much remarked for her beauty and other female accompli&s;hments; and had well nigh produced an open rupture be|tween her and the French count, who, excepting a &s;mall tincture of jealou&s;y in his temper, was the mo&s;t affable good na|tured man in the world. As we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;ay &s;omething about the lady kept by captain R&mdash;rts, it will be pro|per to give the following &s;ketch of her life.</P>
<P>She derived her extraction from parents in the mo&s;t eligible &s;ituation in life, being happily exempt from tho&s;e perplexing difficulties, which attend redundant wealth on the one hand, and tho&s;e corroding cares that accompany meagre want on the other. Her father enjoyed an e&s;tate of a|bout five hundred pounds a year in the we&s;t riding of York&s;hire, where he lived happy in him&s;elf and &s;pou&s;e, beloved by his friends, and re&s;pected by all within the circle of his acquaintance.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="110">She had received a good education from her parents, and at the age of four|teen years began to feel more &s;en&s;ibly tho&s;e longings for plea&s;ure of the animal kind, which principally influenced her future conduct. Her fir&s;t amour was carried on in the following manner.</P>
<P>A young getleman, who was di&s;tantly related to her mother, happening to call as he pa&s;&s;ed by their hou&s;e, was pre&s;&s;ed by her father to &s;tay with them a few weeks. To many per&s;onal charms, were added a deportment peculiarly ea&s;y and polite, and &s;omething uncommonly &s;weet and in&s;inuating in his addre&s;s; therefore it is no wonder that a girl, &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible of love as the young lady was, could not &s;ee him with an indifferent eye. Every word and ge&s;ture of his gave her great plea&s;ure; but when he addre&s;&s;ed his con|ver&s;ation to her, &s;he felt an inward tran&s;|port not ea&s;ily to be de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>It &s;oon appeared that her lover thought he had made a conq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;t of her, for in a &s;hort time &s;he received a letter from him filled with expre&s;&s;ions of love. This gave
<PB N="109" REF="111">
her &s;uch extreme plea&s;ure, that in her an&s;wer, &s;he gave him the &s;tronge&s;t proofs that &s;he approved of his pa&s;&s;ion. After the&s;e mutual declarations, &s;he had &s;oon the happine&s;s of an interview with her new lover, by means of a pretended in|di&s;po&s;ition, when her parents went to pay a vi&s;it: and Mr. JOHNSON'S gaining over to his intere&s;t a neighbouring farmer and his wife, &s;o as to connive at their hou&s;e being made the &s;cene of their fir&s;t joys.</P>
<P>They met by appointment at the hou&s;e of a&s;&s;ignation, and were received by the farmer's wife; who after &s;he had &s;erved them with tea, directly left the room, and con&s;equently the lovers by them&s;elves. I &s;hall not be very particular with re&s;pect to what pa&s;&s;ed at this interview, but con|tent my&s;elf with ob&s;erving, that Mr. JOHNSON &s;aid and did &s;o many obliging things, that the young lady was quite enchanted with him; and at parting longed for a repetition of his kindne&s;&s;es. They could not procure &s;uch interviews &s;o often as &s;he de&s;ired, for fear of creating a &s;u&s;picion, which Mr. JOHNSON mo&s;t cau|tiou&s;ly avoided. But &s;ome few more &s;uch
<PB N="110" REF="112">
they had. However, &s;he &s;oon found that love is more cloying to men than women; as cool indifference &s;oon di&s;covered it|&s;elf in young John&s;on, who grew tired of her father's hou&s;e; and pretending bu&s;ine&s;s in London, that required his immediate attendance took his leave, and left his charmer, <Q>to think on what was pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;igh alone.</Q> She be|gan now to entertain a reli&s;h for variety, and therefore did not much regret the lo&s;s of Mr. John&s;on. This pa&s;&s;ion, which &s;he had in proce&s;s of time in as great a degree as any of the &s;ex, was &s;oon grati|fied with another gallant, who had equal influence over her.</P>
<P>Not long after the departure of Mr. John&s;on, &s;he was invited to a ball in the hou&s;e of a neighbouring gentleman, where it fell out that a young lieutenant was her partner.</P>
<P>A hand&s;ome fellow, and a red coat, could not fail of plea&s;ing her; as &s;he di&s;|covered, not only by his looks, but &s;eve|ral &s;queezes of the hand, unperceived by
<PB N="111" REF="113">
the re&s;t of the company, that he &s;aw her in as favourable a light as &s;he did him.</P>
<P>The dance had not continued long, when &s;e was &s;eized with an odd indi&s;po&s;i|tion, which made her declare a re&s;olution of going home immediately. Her part|ner, after having expre&s;&s;ed his concern, offered to &s;ee her home, which &s;he with &s;eeming reluctance accepted.</P>
<P>It was a very fine evening, and as they walked through a &s;olitary path, &s;he per|ceived that he had his arms about her wai&s;t, but did not expo&s;tulate with him on the liberty he took, or endeavour to di&s;engage her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Indeed &s;he then wanted &s;ome body to &s;upport her, and therefore leaned on her conductor's arm; and thus they pro|ceeded, till they came to the hou&s;e of the farmer above-mentioned; upon which, &s;he de&s;ired to go in, and take &s;omething to revive her &s;pirits: they accordingly en|tered, and were immediately conducted into the room that had been the &s;cene of her former &s;tolen delights, by the woman of
<PB N="112" REF="114">
the hou&s;e; and the young lady &s;oon after received a cordial from the hands of the young officer, that entirely di&s;pelled her indi&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>If curio&s;ity &s;hould excite in any reader a de&s;ire to know what this cordial was, in|formation is given, that it was a gla&s;s of <HI>ratafia;</HI> and a dram is allowable to the mo&s;t delicate lady for the pre&s;ervation or health, or expul&s;ion of di&s;orders. As &s;he did not think it advi&s;eable to go any farther with the young officer, &s;he &s;igni|fied her intention, and he immediately took his leave. The farmer's &s;on was hereupon di&s;patched with an account of the accident that had befallen Mi&s;s, and the chai&s;e was &s;ent to convey her home. She acted her part &s;o well on this occa&s;ion, that her parents entertained not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion, but from a concern for her health, did all in their power to relieve her, though all their efforts had not half the efficacy as the gla&s;s of <HI>ratafia</HI> admi|ni&s;tered to her by the lieutenant at the farmer's hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="115">After a variety of adventures, &s;he at la&s;t came to London; where, after meeting with &s;everal vici&s;&s;itudes, &s;he was at length taken into keeping by Captain R&mdash;rts, of whom, as we have before ob&s;erved, Mi&s;s ELLIOT had made a conque&s;t.</P>
<P>Her new lover's other mi&s;tre&s;s &s;aw, with the greate&s;t indignation, her rival cla&s;ped in the arms of her admirer, and re&s;olved to take ample revenge on her for it. She invented &s;everal ways to effect her de&s;ign, but none met with &s;ucce&s;s. At length, tired with di&s;appointments, &s;he took the wicked re&s;olution of &s;eeking to take away the life of our heroine, by ad|mini&s;tering to her deadly poi&s;on; which &s;he endeavoured to do in the following manner.</P>
<P>As our heroine and &s;he could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to be very intimate, as they were rivals, &s;he one day &s;ent Mi&s;s ELLIOT a very polite card, de&s;iring her to forget all animo&s;ities that might have pa&s;&s;ed be|tween them on account of Captain R&mdash;rts: and furthermore told her, that &s;he was willing to give up all her right in him to
<PB N="114" REF="116">
the more prevailing charms of Mi&s;s EL|LIOT; and gave her a &s;trong invitation to go and &s;ee her.</P>
<P>This invitation our heroine thought &s;it to comply with; and while they were drinking tea, the abandoned pro&s;titute found means to convey what &s;he ima|gined to be ar&s;enick into Mi&s;s ELLIOT'S tea, unperceived. It was by good luck no other than a chymical preparation, inno|cent in it&s;elf, though violent in the ope|ration. This our heroine experienced; for in about half an hour &s;he turned very &s;ick, and was obliged to call a chair to carry her home. When all was over, &s;en|&s;ible that her illne&s;s was the effect of the re&s;entment of Captain R&mdash;rt's mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he re&s;olved to break off all further inter|cour&s;e with him, for fear that her rival &s;hould &s;ome time or other be more &s;uc|ce&s;sful in an attempt on her life. She therefore told Captain R&mdash;rts her rea|&s;ons for de&s;iring him to di&s;continue his vi&s;its; and &s;he was &s;o cautious, that &s;he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed ever to admit of his vi|&s;its any more, though he offered to, and did in reality turn off his former mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="117">About this time our heroine's &s;i&s;ter, who, as we have &s;een in the former part of this hi&s;tory, had u&s;ed her very ill, by running away with the barber, and taking with her the mo&s;t valuable things given to her by Mi&s;s ELLIOT, having met with great misfortunes, was, through a com|plicated &s;eries of cro&s;s accidents, re|duced to ply the &s;treets in the night, &s;o|liciting any body for a gla&s;s of wine, or a beef-&s;teak, and brought to the greate&s;t nece&s;&s;ity in an ho&s;pital, found means to convey a letter to Mi&s;s ELLIOT, begging her a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the humble&s;t manner, and expre&s;&s;ing great compunction for her for|mer mi&s;behaviour.</P>
<P>Our heroine no &s;ooner received the ac|count of FANNY'S unhappy &s;ituation, than her heart was moved with pity and compa&s;&s;ion for her &s;ufferings, and &s;he re|&s;olved to give her that &s;uccour which &s;he, as a &s;i&s;ter, had a right to expect from her. She accordingly flew to the ho&s;pi|tal where her &s;i&s;ter was; and if &s;he com|pa&s;&s;ionated her unhappy &s;ituation before, what were the emotions of her heart when &s;he &s;aw her extended on a bed almo&s;t in a
<PB N="116" REF="118">
dying condition. She approached her, and bade her take courage, for that &s;he was ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t her to the utmo&s;t of her power. She accordingly gave the nur&s;e who attended her a crown, and de&s;ired her to acquaint the governor of the ho&s;pital, that &s;he was come to fetch her &s;i&s;ter away, in order to carry her to a place, where &s;he would be more at ea&s;e during her recove|ry. A chair was then called, and Mi&s;s ELLIOT'S &s;i&s;ter, being wrapped up in blankets, was put into it, and in that manner conveyed to a proper lodging al|ready provided for her</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he was well enough to &s;it up, &s;he gave Mi&s;s ELLIOT a faithful ac|count of all that had happened to her after her elopement with the barber. She related how he had &s;tripped her of every thing, and left her with child: that &s;he had, by the intere&s;t of friends, procured its admi&s;&s;ion into the Foundling-ho&s;pital: that after a variety of adventures, attend|ed with different &s;ucce&s;s, &s;he became at length reduced to the lowe&s;t &s;tate of pro|&s;titution; and having contracted a di&s;tem|per very common among ladies of her
<PB N="117" REF="119">
&s;tamp, &s;he with difficulty procured a let|ter of admi&s;&s;ion into the ho&s;pital, where &s;he had found a way of acquainting her &s;i&s;ter with her deplorable &s;tate.</P>
<P>Our heroine then a&s;ked her what &s;he intended to do to procure a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, as &s;he perceived, by her di&s;cour&s;e, that &s;he intended to live more cha&s;tly than &s;he had heretofore done. This que&s;tion puzzled her not a little; but Mi&s;s ELLIOT &s;oon relieved her from her anxiety, by telling her, that &s;he would allow her fifty pounds per annum, if &s;he would retire &s;omewhere into the country where &s;he was not known. This FANNY joyfully acquie&s;ced in; and as &s;oon as her health would permit:, &s;he went down into Wales, where &s;he changed her name, and really became a pattern of the mo&s;t rigid virtue.</P>
<P>And here I cannot help making the following few reflections on the unhappi|ne&s;s &s;o e&s;&s;entially connected with the life of a pro&s;titute; which, tho' it is mo&s;t de&s;|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ble, is certainly mo&s;t piteous; and if per&s;ons would but candidly reflect on the too general cau&s;e of pro&s;titution, they
<PB N="118" REF="120">
would &s;mooth the wrinkled brow of con|tempt, and from the frown of di&s;dain, di&s;|&s;olve into the tear of compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It may be affirmed from univer&s;al ex|perience, that lo&s;s of female virtue oftner proceeds from weakne&s;s than from vice; an inoffen&s;ive weakne&s;s, which inclines to an implicit reliance on the deluding vows of &s;ome perjured debauchee, or alluring prote&s;tations of &s;ome in&s;inuating rake.</P>
<P>When virtue is once lo&s;t, the de&s;cent down the precipice of vice is very rapid; con&s;cious guilt, and bad example, in&s;en&s;i|bly hurl the di&s;tracted mind, not only into ab&s;olute di&s;&s;ipation, but total depravity. Hence follow a di&s;&s;olution of morals, a di&s;regard to decency, and all the train of amiable qualities that can adorn beauty in a &s;tate of innocence; and then &s;ucceeds every mental deformity that can tarni&s;h a lovely face, or render di&s;gu&s;ting even &s;ymmetry of figure.</P>
<P>The progre&s;s of vice being thus rapid and fatal, it is pre&s;umed, that the attempt in this work, to direct the ri&s;ing generation
<PB N="119" REF="121">
into tho&s;e paths of conduct, which, pur|&s;ued, will certainly enable them to &s;hun the rocks on which others have &s;plit and arrive at the haven of dome&s;tic happine&s;s, will not prove entirely fruitle&s;s.</P>
<P>It is a maxim, true as common, that example affects more than precept; becau&s;e the latter offends our pride, while the for|mer intere&s;ts our pa&s;&s;ions. This remark &s;ugge&s;ted the hint of writing the&s;e &s;heets.</P>
<P>But to return to Mi&s;s ELLIOT's in|trigues: She was now in keeping by the duke de N&mdash;nois, who &s;pared no co&s;t or pains to render him&s;elf agreeable to her: and in &s;hort, indulged her in every thing &s;he could de&s;ire. He took her to all public places to enjoy the plea&s;ures in vogue among the beau monde.</P>
<P>One evening as they were at &s;upper, he &s;aid to her, Give me leave, madam, to lay a&s;ide my character, and let us talk toge|ther with the freedom of equals; my qua|lity &s;ets me at a di&s;tance from you, and makes you ceremonious; your beauty ex|alts you to more than an equality; I mu&s;t
<PB N="120" REF="122">
then treat you as lovers do their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, but I cannot &s;peak the language; it is enough to tell you how agreeable you are to me; how I am &s;urpri&s;ed at your beau|ty, and re&s;olve to make you happy, and to be happy with you.</P>
<P>As N&mdash;nois loved Mi&s;s ELLIOT to di&s;traction, &s;o he rewarded her with a princely munificence; for fir&s;t he &s;ent her a toilet, with the appurtenances of &s;ilver, even &s;o much as the frame of the table; as al&s;o a &s;ide board of plate, with all things belonging to it, of ma&s;&s;y &s;ilver; &s;o that, in &s;hort, there was nothing &s;he could either wi&s;h for or de&s;qire which &s;he did not po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s ELLIOT, who&s;e motive for keeping company with the duke was principally gain, re&s;olved to get as much out of him as &s;he po&s;&s;ibly could, and therefore was always contriving &s;ome way to cau&s;e him to make her &s;ome hand&s;ome pre&s;ent. Clothes and jewels &s;he had in abundance, and her coffer was full of money: &s;he might be &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s, by this time, near ten thou&s;and pounds; for as &s;he had been pretty &s;ucce&s;sful in her intrigues with the
<PB N="121" REF="123">
D&mdash; of C&mdash;, and the Count de Guerchy, &s;o &s;he had lived with proper frugality on the favours they had be&s;towed on her. During the time &s;he lived with this nobleman, &s;he had one child, as beautiful as herself; who, by her own de|&s;ire, was &s;ent over to France, where it now is, without knowing who are its parents, and a proper &s;ettlement is appointed for it.</P>
<P>I am now coming to the la&s;t adventure Mi&s;s ELLIOT ever engaged in, before death put a period to her life. Being one day in the park, a &s;ervant in livery, after acco&s;ting her very re&s;pectfully, put a letter into her hand, and without waiting for an an&s;wer retired. She &s;eated her&s;elf on a bench, and opening the letter, found it was written by the lord H&mdash;h, reque&s;t|ing the honour of a vi&s;it from her at his own hou&s;e. Filled with joy at this happy e|vent, &s;he immediately went home, and &s;at down to write a &s;uitable an&s;wer to it. In the afternoon &s;he dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf in the fine&s;t clothes &s;he had, and went to his lord&s;hip's hou&s;e, where he received her with open arms, and told her he was dying for love of her, that his life depended on her
<PB N="122" REF="124">
&s;miles only, and proceeded to make over|tures to her of becoming his mi&s;tre&s;s. She told him that &s;he was already engaged, but neverthele&s;s had no objection to ac|cept of his generous offer, provided their intrigue could be carried on without the duke's knowledge. In order therefore to conceal their amour the better, they a|greed to meet as often as convenient at his lord&s;hip's hou&s;e, which they did, and for about half a year together, without any one taking the lea&s;t notice of it, or &s;u&s;pecting in the lea&s;t the intercour&s;e that pa&s;&s;ed between them. At the expiration of this time, his lord&s;hip, who was already married, received a letter from his lady, who had been at the German Spa to drink the waters, intimating that &s;he was on her return to England. This thunder|&s;truck his lord&s;hip, who was &s;en&s;ible, that on her lady&s;hip's coming home, his new mi&s;tre&s;s mu&s;t decamp. He &s;hewed our heroine the letter: who having read it, bid him not be at all unea&s;y, for that &s;he would order mattters &s;o that the mo&s;t vi|gilant eye &s;hould never be able to di&s;cover their intrigue.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="125">Mi&s;s Elliot was however mi&s;taken in this, for her lady&s;hip had not been in town above a month before the whole plot was revealed to her in the following manner.</P>
<P>This noble lord went one afternoon to Mi&s;s ELLIOT's lodgings, where, as they were toying together, a &s;ervant maid be|longing to the hou&s;e brought up a letter for him, from &s;ome gentlemen, reque&s;ting his company at a neighbouring tavern, where they were in company with &s;ome young ladies of Covent Garden, with whom they intended to pa&s;s the night. His lord&s;hip obeyed the &s;ummons, and gave the maid half a guinea, telling her not to mention to any one what &s;he had &s;een pa&s;s between Mi&s;s ELLIOT and him.</P>
<P>The all prevailing metal, had not however &s;ufficient influence over her, to make her ob&s;erve his lord&s;hip's injunctions. She could not help telling what &s;he had &s;een as a &s;ecret to a fellow &s;ervant, who told it to another; and thus in a few days, it was known to all the dome&s;tics of his lord&s;hip's family.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="126">His lord&s;hip had, not long before, or|dered one of his footmen to be di&s;charged for a trivial offence, of which in reality he had not been guilty; but which, through the malice of the &s;teward, had been laid to his charge. This fellow, who now went to the hou&s;e where his former ma&s;ter lived, hearing of the affair, re&s;olved, out of a principle of revenge, to acquaint his lady with it; which he found means to do by her woman, who informed her lady with all the particulars. This ac|count was far from being plea&s;ing to her; however, that &s;he might not be thought to credit a fal&s;e report, &s;he re&s;olved to watch his lord&s;hip's motions very narrowly; and had her &s;pies abroad, who kept a con&s;tant eye on all his proceedings.</P>
<P>One day her &s;pies brought her word, that her lord was engaged with &s;ome com|pany to go to Ranelagh; &s;he took the hint, and di&s;gui&s;ing her&s;elf, went thither al&s;o. She had not been long there before &s;he &s;aw her hu&s;band in an arbour with Mi&s;s ELLIOT; and placing her&s;elf in a conve|nient &s;pot, where &s;he could &s;ee all that pa&s;&s;ed without being perceived, &s;he be|held
<PB N="125" REF="127">
them in a po&s;ture which &s;oon con|vinced her that &s;he had no rea&s;on to di&s;|credit the report &s;he had heard. She in|&s;tantly quitted the gardens, and returned home, firmly re&s;olved to let his lord&s;hip know, that &s;he was not unacquainted with his di&s;honourable treatment of her.</P>
<P>She was, however, mi&s;taken in the ex|ecution of her de&s;ign, as he did not come home till three days after; having been all that time at a bagnio with his mi&s;tre&s;s, who&s;e other lover happened to be gone for a fortnight into the country for his health, having lately been ill of a fever.</P>
<P>When his lord&s;hip returned, his lady received him very coolly; at which, being unable to gue&s;s the cau&s;e, he was greatly &s;urpri&s;ed. He &s;eemed, however, not to take any notice, 'till the time of retiring to re&s;t being come, her lady&s;hip refu&s;ed to lie with him; and it was &s;ome time be|fore &s;he would con&s;ent to tell him the rea|&s;on of her acting in that manner. She at la&s;t di&s;covered to him all &s;he knew of his intrigue with Mi&s;s ELLIOT, and how &s;he had ocular proof of their intimacy
<PB N="126" REF="128">
from what &s;he had &s;een in Ranelagh gar|dens. She then reproached him in the &s;evere&s;t terms for his meanne&s;s of &s;oul, which had &s;uffered him to abandon his wife, who was a lady of quality, for the embraces of a harlot, with many other things of the like &s;ort.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip after having in vain en|deavoured to extenuate his crime, frankly owned his guilt, on condition that his la|dy &s;hould never reproach him for it: this &s;he generou&s;ly promi&s;ed, provided he al&s;o promi&s;ed never to &s;ee Mi&s;s ELLIOT more, to which he gave his word of honour he never would: and his future conduct plainly &s;hewed that he &s;poke truth.</P>
<P>N&mdash;nois, who had never received the lea&s;t item of Mi&s;s ELLIOT's amour with the lord H&mdash;h, grew every day more and more fond of her. He lavi&s;hed away &s;o much money on her, that &s;he was reckoned one of the riche&s;t of all the trading ladies in London. She continued to pay her &s;i&s;ter's pen&s;ion very con&s;tantly; and having informed her keep|er of her &s;i&s;ter's former &s;tate of indigence,
<PB N="127" REF="129">
and of the allowance &s;he gave her, he out of his genero&s;ity &s;ettled fifty pound a year more on her during life, which made her income an hundred pounds a year; which, as &s;he was in a cheap country enabled her to live like a woman of rank and fortune.</P>
<P>The duke now received orders from his court to depart from England, where he had been mini&s;ter plenipotentiary for &s;everal years. He propo&s;ed to our heroine to go along with him; which &s;he complied with: and Paris opened to her a new &s;cene of adventures, which were at the &s;ame time both &s;erious and comical; tho' &s;he never embarked, as has been already ob|&s;erved, in any intrigue &s;o as to leave her keeper, with whom &s;he continued till his death, which happened about a year after he was recalled to his native country.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t adventures &s;he met with was in the Thuilleries, where &s;he one day, &s;oon after her arrival, met with a German count, named CZATORISKI. He very po|litely &s;aluted her; and &s;eeing &s;he was a &s;tranger, de&s;ired leave to accompany her all about the city, to &s;hew her what was
<PB N="128" REF="130">
mo&s;t curious. This genteel propo&s;al &s;he li&s;tened to with a &s;ecret &s;atisfaction, and accepted of it. She told him that &s;he was a lady of quality, and wife to the duke de N&mdash;nois: that therefore, as &s;he was not entirely at her own di&s;po&s;al, he mu&s;t obtain her hu&s;band's con&s;ent: this piece of cunning met with the de&s;ired &s;ucce&s;s. She had intimated to the duke her de&s;ire of pa&s;&s;ing for his wife, and he had gratified her reque&s;t by publicly own|ing her for &s;uch; and all the nobility of the French court, who were very fond of her company, always gave her the appel|lation of dutche&s;s.</P>
<P>The count, who was N&mdash;nois's particular friend, communicated to him his intention of accompanying Mi&s;s EL|LIOT to all the places of note in Paris, and its environs; and the duke, who look|ed on his mi&s;tre&s;s to be another LUCRETIA, gave his con&s;ent without he&s;itation. Thus was our heroine carried about by CZATO|RISKI to every place worthy or notice; and every body remarked, that &s;he was
<PB N="129" REF="131">
oftner &s;een in his company than in that of her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>It was in one of the&s;e excur&s;ions, that he began to entertain a notion that it would not be altogether impo&s;&s;ible to &s;uc|ceed in a &s;cheme he had formed of at|tacking the fortre&s;s of her cha&s;tity. This he contrived in the following manner: he had often heard her &s;ay how happy &s;he conceived the French ladies mu&s;t be, who were not kept under that re&s;traint which the Engli&s;h ladies were; adding, that if any thing could make her wi&s;h not to be an Engli&s;h woman, it would be that of enjoying more liberty; and at the &s;ame time &s;aid, that the faults committed by the fair &s;ex, in regard to the fidelity they owed their hu&s;bands, were principally owing to their too great confinement. This ap|peared to the count as a fair opportunity; and he an&s;wered, that to be &s;ure &s;he was very right in her notions, and that there|fore, as &s;he might, in &s;ome &s;ort, be &s;aid to enjoy more liberty than many others of her own &s;ex, he humbly conceived &s;he ought to make the be&s;t u&s;e of her time,
<PB N="130" REF="132">
as &s;he did not know how long &s;he might live in that country to partake of the plea|&s;ures it afforded.</P>
<P>This di&s;cour&s;e would have been very di&s;gu&s;ting to any woman, who&s;e inclinati|ons were not like tho&s;e of Mi&s;s ELLIOT. To her it was the mo&s;t delightful &s;he ever heard; and her an&s;wer to it was &s;uch as convinced CZATORISKI, that he was not deceived in the idea he had formed of her virtue. She deferred, however, giving him too great encouragement, and kept him in &s;u&s;pence, till &s;he found by a &s;ecret in|quiry into his connexions, that he kept at that time no le&s;s than three mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> her decline any farther inter|cour&s;e with him, as &s;he had not hitherto indulged him with any private interview.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> this affair, &s;he went in company with &s;ome <HI>filles de joye</HI> to a noted tavern in the city; where having &s;upped in c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mpany with &s;ome gentlemen, about midnight they all retired to their repo&s;e; and Mi&s;s ELLIOT, who did not go there with intention to find a lover, lay by her&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="133">They had not been above an hour at repo&s;e, before the watch, pa&s;&s;ing by, gave the alarm of fire: our heroine would have been the fir&s;t to make her e&s;cape, could &s;he have effected it, but being in the dark, could not find her way out of the room. The fire, which happened about ten doors from the hou&s;e were &s;he was, being &s;oon extingui&s;hed by proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the a|larmed neighbourhood retired to thier re|&s;pective habitations.</P>
<P>The male lodgers of this nocturnal re|&s;idence returned, as they thought, to their proper beds; but one of them, mi&s;&s;ing his own chamber, which was next to Mi&s;s ELLIOT's, entered hers, and went to bed to her.</P>
<P>The mi&s;take was not immediately di&s;|covered: though our heroine was far from being di&s;plea&s;ed, particularly when her unknown lover exclaimed, <Q>What bli&s;s! What ec&s;ta&s;y! What &s;en&s;ations!</Q> This induced her to believe, &s;he was not the imagined object of the warm embrace. However, as &s;he conceived her lover
<PB N="132" REF="134">
might from the fir&s;t have taken her for his own mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he re&s;olved not to clear up the my&s;tery.</P>
<P>At day-break, &s;he was awaked by a mumbling clamour in the next room, by a female voice, lamenting the hard for|tune of being obliged to pa&s;s the night with an impotent old dotard, while her companion kept time with the mu&s;ic of her note; being more under the influence of Morpheus than Venus.</P>
<P>Our heroine, de&s;irous of knowing the cau&s;e of this di&s;order, aro&s;e, and perceived a gentleman, whom &s;he had ob&s;erved at &s;upper, at the other&s;ide of the thre&s;hold: her curio&s;ity now led her to inquire how he came to depute another to &s;upply his place; and the my&s;tery being unraveled, &s;he was highly entertained with the mi&s;|take. The truth was, a gentleman had an intrigue with his own wife without knowing it; and her favourite man had been care&s;&s;ing Mi&s;s ELLIOT through mi&s;|take for his mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="135">Some time after this adventure, Mi&s;s ELLIOT was engaged in another, which proved equally diverting with the former. An old French marquis, who was of a very amorous turn of mind, had lately been married to a young woman; who, not &s;atisfied with her hu&s;band, had left him to live with a young French officer. This old gentleman, who re&s;olved to be even with his wife, was looking out for &s;ome young woman, over whom his gold might make &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion; and having &s;een Mi&s;s ETLIOT at the play, re&s;olved to tempt her with the golden bait. Accord|ingly, having found out where &s;he lived, he &s;ent his &s;ervant to her with a letter, re|que&s;ting leave to &s;ee her at her own lodg|ings, as he had &s;omething of importance to communicate to her.</P>
<P>She returned for an&s;wer, that &s;he &s;hould be very glad to &s;ee him the next day; and he accordingly came at the appointed time. When he entered the room where &s;he was, he &s;aluted her very re&s;pectfully, which &s;he returned with equal politene&s;s: and being &s;eated, he began to tell her his errand; adding, that if &s;he proved cruel, it mu&s;t
<PB N="134" REF="136">
infallibly put an end to his life. Mi&s;s ELLIOT &s;miled within her&s;elf at his di&s;|cour&s;e, and imagining the duke could not have the lea&s;t rea&s;on to object again&s;t her ke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ping company with a per&s;on four|&s;core years of age, &s;he gave him &s;uch an|&s;wers, as &s;eemed to intimate, that he was far from being di&s;agreeable to her.</P>
<P>The marquis de Chancy (for that was his name) re&s;olved to do all he could to render him&s;elf agreeable to her, and ac|cordingly loaded her with pre&s;ents and money, jewels and other valuable things, to a very con&s;iderable amount; in return for all which favours he e&s;teemed him&s;elf amply recompenced, if he was &s;ometimes indu'ged with the favour of a ki&s;s, or a &s;queeze of her hand. Our heroine was perfectly well &s;atisfied with her new lov|er, who&s;e deportment was really &s;o far from leaving any room for jealou&s;y, that it excited a deal of laughter in the duke when he was told of it; and with all the good humour imaginable, he congratu|lated his mi&s;tre&s;s on the new conque&s;t &s;he had made. The old marquis on the other
<PB N="135" REF="137">
hand, rejoiced that he had &s;ucceeded &s;o well in his amour with Mi&s;s ELLIOT; and thought the revenge he was now taking on his wife for her infidelity to him, en|tirely adequate to her crime.</P>
<P>He did not however long enjoy his &s;up|po&s;ed happine&s;s. The duke de N&mdash;nois invited the old gentleman to pa&s;s a month during the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on with him, at his country feat, at the village of Bray, &s;i|tuated about four miles to the &s;outh of Paris. While they were there, the amour between the marquis and Mi&s;s ELLIOT was di&s;covered by the officer who had &s;o often adorned the old gentleman's forehead with what is e&s;teemed an opprobrium to married men.</P>
<P>Although before this di&s;covery he had carried on the intrigue with very little re|&s;traint, he now openly avowed it; and our heroine to &s;ave her reputation was con|&s;trained to de&s;ire him to di&s;continue his vi&s;its, which he mo&s;t readily complied with, as his fortune would not &s;uffer him to &s;upport the expence he daily in|curred
<PB N="136" REF="138">
in keeping company with one &s;o extravagant as Mi&s;s ELLIOT.</P>
<P>It did not end here with the marquis, for the officer having told all his acquain|tance the affair between him and our heroine, it added not a little to the le&s;&s;en|ing of his character; and he therefore concluded that he had much better &s;eek out &s;ome other mi&s;tre&s;s, one who was not kept by, or had any connexion with any other men, as that would alone exempt him from the danger of being made the ridicule of all his acquaintance.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s ELLIOT's next lover was a captain of foot, who behaved very generous to her, &s;o as to merit her good graces in a higher degree, than any who &s;olicited her favours after &s;he was kept by the marquis de Chancy. He was a man endowed with &s;uch amiable qualities, that no woman could &s;ee him without imme|diately falling in love with him; and he had al&s;o &s;uch an engaging manner, that tho&s;e who had been once in his company were become enamoured of him. With the&s;e qualifications, which were &s;ufficient
<PB N="137" REF="139">
to recommend him to the love of a woman of far le&s;s vanity than Mi&s;s ELLIOT, he found the way to her heart, and he had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee that he was as agreeable to her as &s;he could be to him. It may perhaps not be di&s;a|greeable to give our readers the following account of him.</P>
<P>He was called captain R&mdash;&s;s, and was in his youth de&s;tined for maritime &s;ervice. His father, who was a gentleman of &s;mall fortune in the we&s;t of England, had made friends to procure him the king's letter for a man of war; but as his greate&s;t ambition was to appear the polite man, and the &s;ea generally giving an air of ru&s;ticity which frequenting the be&s;t company can &s;carce wear off, he was ob|&s;tinately bent on not accepting this pro|po&s;al. Though his father had &s;ufficient friends at the admiralty to obtain this favour, he had none who would crown his hopes by procuring a commi&s;&s;ion in the army. However, an uncle dying a|bout that time, and leaving him a legacy, he purcha&s;ed with it an ensigncy in a marching regiment.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="140">He was &s;oon ordered to quarters, when he gave ample te&s;timony of his gentility, and genius for military affairs. He made an attack on every pretty girl in the town, taking &s;ome by &s;urpri&s;e, and o|thers by capitulation. He &s;tormed every drinking hou&s;e at four in the morning, and where the garri&s;on was ob&s;tinate made the e&s;calade, and carried the liquor &s;word in hand. So great was his martial &s;kill and valour this way, that if he had not &s;oon changed quarters, the complaints of the inhabitants would have gone a great way towards breaking him.</P>
<P>He was now eighteen, tall, well made, and hand&s;ome; fluent in &s;peech, and im|pudent in deportment; at a country town, a young lady with five thou&s;and pounds in her own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;aw his charming per&s;on, and could not re&s;i&s;t him. She ogled him&mdash;&s;he wrote to him&mdash;he an&s;wered hear&mdash;and at la&s;t married her.</P>
<P>After enjoyment, he could &s;ee no other endearment than her fortune. He po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of it, and quitted his quar|ters.
<PB N="139" REF="141">
He came to London, hired an ele|gant hou&s;e, purcha&s;ed rich furniture, and &s;et up a genteel equipage; he dre&s;&s;ed as well as any man in town, and kept as good company. To keep good company, and be ruined, with a young man are al|mo&s;t &s;ynonymous terms. Two months fre|quenting Arthur's carried off his wife's fortune and the &s;ale of his commi&s;&s;ion. A few levants at the chocolate-hou&s;e pro|&s;cribed him. Here terminated his pre&s;ent glory.</P>
<P>Our hero made the mo&s;t of his effects, left his creditors an empty hou&s;e to con|template, and &s;et out for Bri&s;tol, where he in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the good graces of one Mr. JACKSON, a merchant with whom he &s;till pa&s;&s;ed for an officer; and giving a very exact detail of the gentlemen of the corps he lately belonged to, the decep|tion failed not to &s;ucceed, and he had the addre&s;s to gain credit for any rea&s;onable &s;um. He failed not to make u&s;e of the advantage; and for the fir&s;t time drew only for two hundred pounds; which bill being paid on &s;ight, he next drew for five hundred, and the gentleman &s;till did ho|nour
<PB N="140" REF="142">
to his draught, in&s;omuch that had not his moderation been &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by Mr. JACKSON's genero&s;ity, he might have con|tinued drawing for any con&s;iderable &s;um. Soon after, he paid his addre&s;&s;es to a rich merchant's daughter at Liverpool; who&s;e father was dead, and had left her fortune in the hands of tru&s;tees till &s;he was of age, one of whom &s;he then lived with.</P>
<P>This gentleman approved his &s;uit; but before he would &s;ign any writings, de|&s;ired he would realize his prote&s;tations. This induced him to draw upon his Bri&s;tol friend for five thou&s;and pounds. So great a bill proved its own abortion; for even if the gentleman had had ca&s;h enough to an&s;wer it, which he had not, &s;uch a capi|tal &s;um could not fail of giving him &s;ome alarm; and the bill returned, with the po&s;t unaccepted.</P>
<P>Having in the interim made great ad|vances towards gaining his mi&s;tre&s;s's heart, he went him&s;elf, as &s;oon as the po&s;t came, to receive his letters, and thereby gained intelligence of the return of his bill &s;everal hours before the tru&s;tee, who had not his
<PB N="141" REF="143">
letters before the next morning. He now &s;aw there was but one re&s;ource to &s;uc|ceed.</P>
<P>He went immediately to the young la|dy, who had appointed that evening for an interview; and with the utmo&s;t con|cern told her he had received a letter from London, which acquainted him with his uncle's being at the point of death, and his de&s;ire of &s;eeing his nephew before he departed this life; adding, that his uncle and he had been at &s;ome little variance for a good while, and that he flattered him&s;elf, that if he could arrive in town time enough to be reconciled to him, he &s;hould have &s;ufficient influence over him, to get rein&s;tated in his will in lieu of his brother, who, &s;ince the breach, had &s;upplied the place: that therefore he propo&s;ed &s;eting out that evening; and yet the thought of leaving his charmer &s;truck far deeper into his heart than the lo&s;s of the fortune he might obtain: that he was &s;en&s;ible, to pro|po&s;e a journey before they were married, might create in her &s;ome &s;u&s;picion of his intentions: that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to get the ceremony performed that even|ing:
<PB N="142" REF="144">
and that he doubted not her guar|dian would oppo&s;e her intentions, if they were inclined to take &s;uch a journey: that therefore if &s;he had a mind to prevent his being the mo&s;t mi&s;erable man in the world, &s;he mu&s;t &s;et out with him in a po&s;t-chai&s;e incog. that evening, without the know|ledge of her tru&s;tee; and that to prevent all tear on her &s;ide, they &s;hould be mar|ried the next morning at the fir&s;t town they came to.</P>
<P>However plau&s;ible this &s;tory, and how|ever &s;eriou&s;ly, and happily related, &s;he could not fail of being &s;hocked at the thoughts of &s;o precipate a journey, with|out the privacy of any of her friends. But &s;o great was her attachment grown, that &s;he could not reflect upon her being the imaginary cau&s;e of her lover's lo&s;ing &s;o fair a pro&s;pect of being in his uncle's will without the utmo&s;t repugnance; and to be made a woman and a wife the next morning, was what &s;he &s;o much approv|ed, that her inclination &s;urmounted her rea&s;on, and &s;he agreed to &s;et out between two and three for London.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="145">With all imaginable privacy, they got into a po&s;t-chai&s;e, which &s;et out at the time appointed; and her maid and his &s;er|vant followed them about an hour after with the baggage belonging to the young officer and his mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Agreeable to his promi&s;e, he made a bride of her at the fir&s;t town they came to, and they then continued their journey without the lea&s;t precipitancy.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the tru&s;tee was acquainted with the flight of the lady, he made in|quired all over the town, in order to be informed what rout the fugitives had taken; imagining, however, that it might be a frolic, as he expected that day to re|ceive, by the return of the po&s;t, advice from his corre&s;pondent of the payment of the bill; but when he was informed that two po&s;t-chai&s;es &s;et out that morning for Lon|don, and that his ward was actually gone in one of them, in company with her lover, he was greatly &s;taggered in his opinion. The receipt of the letters from Bri&s;tol &s;oon fixed it, and determined him to &s;et out immediately in pur&s;uit of the lady.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="146">He overtook the lovers at an inn on the road, and after &s;aluting them, de&s;ired to know whether they were going. The of|ficer an&s;wered, to London. This, the other &s;aid, he might do, but his ward mu&s;t return with him, for that our hero was an impo&s;tor; &s;howing the letter he had received from Bri&s;tol.</P>
<P>The lady &s;eemed greatly &s;urpri&s;ed at this, while her hu&s;band in&s;i&s;ted that &s;ome body had an&s;wered that letter in his name, on purpo&s;e to prejudice him in the lady's favour. The guardian replied, that &s;uch &s;ubterfuges were too glaring to impo&s;e on him, and that the lady &s;hould not &s;tep one inch farther with him.</P>
<P>The chai&s;e being ready at the inn door at this time, they came out, and he ad|dre&s;&s;ed his wife in the&s;e terms: <Q>Madam, do you chu&s;e to go with me, who am your lawful hu&s;band, or with that old gentleman?</Q> At this interrogation &s;he &s;tretched out her hand, he helped her in, and left her guardian and the re&s;t of the &s;pectators, in the greate&s;t con&s;ternation.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="147">They immediately repaired to London, and by means of publi&s;hing his marriage with an heire&s;s (as &s;he really was) of eight thou&s;and pounds fortune, he got as much credit as he wanted, though he was oblig|ed to give 20 per cent. intere&s;t for ready money. By this means they lived in an elegant and luxurious manner, and to all appearance no couple were &s;o happy as capt. R&mdash;&s;s and his wife.</P>
<P>The time of her being at age came which was &s;ixteen months after the mar|riage was celebrated, and the hu&s;band wrote to her tru&s;tee for all her papers, which he refu&s;ed at fir&s;t to deliver; but at length finding capt. R&mdash;&s;s was re&s;o|lute, he complied; and our hero was put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all her fortune.</P>
<P>But after the debts lie had contracted &s;ince his marriage were paid, and al&s;o the ready money borrowed, with intere&s;t, was returned to tho&s;e who had lent it, he had but three thou&s;and pounds left, which, he &s;ound by experience, would la&s;t but a &s;hort time, at the rate they then lived in keeping hou&s;e. Upon this he told his wife
<PB N="146" REF="148">
the nece&s;&s;ity there was of retiring into the country, and living frugally. She con&s;ent|ed to it; and accordingly &s;et out for York|&s;hire, where he boarded her at a farm|hou&s;e for twenty pounds a year.</P>
<P>With the remainder of his wife's fortune he returned to London, and gamed, whored, drank, and committed every &s;pecies of extravagance, till it was pretty near exhau&s;ted. He then thought it time to recruit; and recollecting that a di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> relation of his, an old methodi&s;t woman, lived in York&s;hire, &s;aid to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> twelve hundred pounds, he immediately &s;et out for the place: but, finding &s;he conver&s;ed with none but tho&s;e of her own &s;ect, he was under an obligation of be|coming a convert to get acce&s;s to her; and no body pronounced, <Q>We are all irre|trievably damned</Q> better than him&s;elf. In a word he was a &s;taunch methodi&s;t.</P>
<P>So young and hand&s;ome a pro&s;elyte was the admiration of all the congregation, particularly the female part; and being taken notice of by the old lady for his &s;anctity, he found means to gain acce&s;s by pre&s;enting her with a new edition of
<PB N="147" REF="149">
Mr. We&s;ley's &s;ermons, which was &s;o ac|ceptable to her, that &s;he thought that &s;he could never &s;ufficiently acknowledge the favour. She imagined that Mr. White|field and Mr. We&s;ley were the only two good men in the world; but &s;he then be|gan to think there was a third, a young &s;aint both in thought and deed.</P>
<P>After he had thus in&s;inuated him&s;elf into her good graces, he began to feel her pul&s;e upon the &s;core of matrimony. No|thing ever appeared &s;o inanimate and rigid at fir&s;t: but when he began to talk of &s;piritual love, un&s;ullied with lu&s;tful thoughts, &s;he gave ear to him, and was at length of opinion, that a woman might enter into the &s;tate of matrimony only, without being irretrievably damned, pro|vided there were always &s;eperate beds. He entirely acquie&s;ced in whatever &s;he &s;aid; and after about half a year's &s;piri|tual court&s;hip, they took each other for better for wor&s;e.</P>
<P>He left her as &s;oon as he could po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of her money, telling her, that &s;he neither wanted gold, or a young fellow to
<PB N="148" REF="150">
carry her to heaven; and that, as &s;he had fixed her mind entirely on &s;piritual things, it was doing her a great kindne&s;s to take temptations far out of the way.</P>
<P>The captain again returned to London, where meeting with an old flame, he took a lodging with her, and lived &s;nug for &s;ome time, but his ca&s;h circulating too fa&s;t at the gaming table, he was obliged to have recour&s;e to drawing upon &s;everal friends for money; but few or them an|&s;wered his bills, and what little money he procured from them, with the utmo&s;t dif|ficulty, la&s;ted but a &s;hort time. He mar|ried &s;ix different wives in three months, who&s;e fortunes, put together, made but two hundred pounds, and their ages three hundred years.</P>
<P>He now introduced him&s;elf to the ac|quaintance of one Stroud, who had found a comfortable means of livelihood, by hiring hou&s;es, furni&s;hing them upon cre|dit, and di&s;po&s;ed of the furniture. He engaged with him in his plan, which at fir&s;t proved better than the wife-trade, for
<PB N="149" REF="151">
in le&s;s than &s;ix weeks, they cleared two thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>They did not, however continue long &s;ucce&s;&s;ful; for &s;oon after Stroud was ta|ken up for one of tho&s;e frauds, which captain R&mdash;fs thought a &s;ufficient hint for him to decamp. Accordingly he went to Paris, having no other depen|dence than the ready money he had car|ried with him thither.</P>
<P>He fir&s;t paid his addre&s;&s;es to Mi&s;s EL|LIOT, as one whom he mo&s;t ardently de&s;ired to make his wife; but &s;he had too much penetration, as &s;he was already acquainted with his character from &s;everal of his in|timates in the city where &s;he re&s;ided, to &s;uf|fer her&s;elf, who had taken a firm re&s;oluti|on of never entering into the married &s;tate, to li&s;ten to the overtures he had made he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. She was not aver&s;e to his per&s;on, and would have been very willing to have been his mi&s;tre&s;s, had his finances been an&s;wer|able to the high demands &s;he made on her lovers; but as he was low in ca&s;h, &s;he thought it be&s;t to give him his <HI>cong&egrave;</HI> at fir&s;t; and accordingly, ordered her &s;er|vants
<PB N="150" REF="152">
to deny her to him, as often as be|came; till after &s;ome time being weary of the&s;e repeated denials, he re&s;olved to leave off frequenting her hou&s;e, and was never afterwards &s;een there.</P>
<P>Our heroine had now lived near a twelve month with the duke de N&mdash;NOIS, who was extremely fond of her; and &s;he had always employed every means her inven|tion could &s;ugge&s;t to her, to increa&s;e his affection towards her. But as people of an uneven temper cannot po&s;&s;ibly be &s;uppo&s;|ed always to act con&s;i&s;tent to their true intere&s;t, &s;o neither did Mi&s;s ELLIOT; &s;he having the misfortune to incur her keep|er's di&s;plea&s;ure, by being di&s;covered in an intrigue with his grace's &s;ecretary, for which he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her, and &s;he prepared to &s;et out immediately for her native country.</P>
<P>I cannot take leave of Paris, whither I have accompanied our heroine, without &s;ome few remarks on the poverty and pride of the French, who&s;e ambition and vanity are evidently without a parallel, as the fol|lowing example will clearly evince.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="153">Walking one day in the gardens of Ver&s;ailles, all eyes were in a minute on her, and &s;he was not le&s;s attentive to the many objects that &s;urrounded her: They were all in ma&s;querade to her, even if &s;he had before known them; for not only the women were painted, but even the men. The fops and petit maitres wore patches and rouge. After &s;he had been pre&s;ented to &s;ome of <HI>la premiere noble&s;&s;e,</HI> as an Eng|li&s;h lady of fa&s;hion; &s;he a&s;ked the duke, who was with her, concerning many of tho&s;e whom &s;he &s;aw. A gentleman, with a red feather, fir&s;t attracted her ob&s;ervati|on: She a&s;ked who he was; taking him for &s;ome foreign amba&s;&s;ador. The duke replied, he was a chevalier de St. Louis, who had nothing more than a pen&s;ion of three hundred livres to live on. Mi&s;s EL|LIOT'S curio&s;ity then led her to inquire if he followed any bu&s;ine&s;s: but &s;he was an|&s;wered in the negative; it being too great a di&s;grace on a native of France, to be of any trade, unle&s;s that of a bottle-blower, which they e&s;teem far beyond being a merchant.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="154">She was much &s;urprized at what had been told her concerning the gentleman with the red feather, though &s;he could not then divine the my&s;tery; yet &s;he at length under&s;tood it, on being told, that &s;uch is the temper of the French, that they will rather &s;tarve than work, except they are employed in a gla&s;s hou&s;e, which they e|&s;teem an honour; though they look on the profe&s;&s;ion of a merchant as an ab&s;olute di&s;grace.</P>
<P>She next inquired of the duke, the name of a lady whom &s;he &s;aw dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;umptuous &s;uit of cloaths and very rich jewels. She was an&s;wered, that it was mademoi&s;elle COIGNI, who, in &s;pight of all that her relations could do, would not be confined to a nunnery, which is the method of getting rid of younger daugh|ters in popi&s;h countries: that indeed, a very rich match had been offered her from one of the farmers general, worth three millions of livres; but that her father, who was of the be&s;t blood in France, had, with truly honourable indignation, refu&s;|ed to deba&s;e his family by &s;uch an alliance;
<PB N="153" REF="155">
and as his daughter would not retire to a convent, he had laid out all the money which he had de&s;tined for placing her there for life (which was her only portion) in cloaths and jewels: and that the chevalier de St. Louis, whom they had been ju&s;t talking of, was pitched on for her intend|ed hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Our readers will, I dare &s;ay, be unable to help te&s;tifiying their &s;urpri&s;e at &s;uch a noble beggar's wedding; and the more &s;o when they are informed, that the lady's father, notwith&s;tanding his great de&s;cent, had not intere&s;t enough to procure a &s;ubaltern commi&s;&s;ion in the army, or any, po&s;t equivalent.</P>
<P>But to wave the&s;e remarks, and turn to the main point, Mi&s;s ELLIOT, having, as already &s;hown, had the misfortune to di&s;oblige her keeper, prepared her&s;elf for a journey with all convenient &s;peed; and at the end of three days, having packed up all her things, &s;he &s;et out in a po&s;t chai&s;e attended by three &s;ervants for Calais, the duke paying all the expences of her
<PB N="154" REF="156">
journey, and pre&s;enting her with a bank note of five hundred pounds.</P>
<P>Our female Traveller made &s;o much ha&s;te to get out of France, that in forty eight hours &s;he reached Abbeville. When &s;he arrived there, &s;he alighted out of the chai&s;e to refre&s;h her&s;elf; and as &s;he was &s;itting in a room in the inn, &s;he &s;aw a young woman in a riding dre&s;s &s;top at the hou&s;e where &s;he was, and di&s;mounting from her hor&s;e enter at the gate. Mi&s;s ELLIOT imagined &s;he knew her face; and her curio&s;ity was &s;o great, that in order to &s;atisfy it, &s;he was prompted to take a near|er view of her. She accordingly quitted the room where &s;he then was, and walked our to ob&s;erve the &s;tranger better. She was greatly &s;urpri&s;ed, when &s;he found that it was her old acquaintance Mi&s;s Ham|mond. Our heroine made her go into her room, where being &s;eated, &s;he gave her the following account of her rea&s;ons for leaving England: and as they are too clo&s;ely connected with her hi&s;tory to be &s;eperated from it, I &s;hall take the liberty to tre&s;pa&s; s a little on my readers patience,
<PB N="155" REF="157">
while I relate them in the mo&s;t conci&s;e manner po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>She was the only daughter of Mr. Hammond, a rich merchant in&mdash;Street, who gave her an education &s;uitable to her birth, and the fortune he de&s;igned to give her. dancing mu&s;ick, Italian and French, added to her figure, could not fail of procuring her an early train of lovers. Innocence, the happie&s;t &s;tate of mortals, and her mother's care, protected her from all di&s;honourable attacks. Many matches were propo&s;ed for her, but either birth or fortune was deficient in the &s;uitors.</P>
<P>She happened once at an a&s;&s;embly to &s;ee a gentleman, who was as much a &s;tranger to her as &s;he was to him. He took her out to dance, and whi&s;pered to her fre|quently about the force of her charms; all which the innocent maid con&s;trued as the effect of his good breeding. The next day produced from him a letter full of knight errantry, with flames and darts at every line. Mi&s;s Hammond looked on this letter in its true light, thinking it,
<PB N="156" REF="158">
rather a te&s;timony of his lu&s;t, than of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> love.</P>
<P>When he found her inexorable to all his fine &s;peeches and letters, he left the place, though not without &s;ome &s;tratagems to carry her off. A year elap&s;ed, without her hearing any more of him, and he was entirely obliterated.</P>
<P>At the end of this time, a man &s;eem|ingly a gentleman, who pretended to be a Scotchman, fell in love with her. Her mother was then dead,, and her father had now an opportunity of di&s;po&s;ing of her, as he imagined, much to her advantage. Her intended hu&s;band propo&s;ed deferring the ceremony about a month, that there might be time to agree on the articles of her marriage &s;ettlement. The ceremony of her nuptials was performed by her hu&s;|band's &s;uppo&s;ed brother, at his own cham|bers in the temple, and the con&s;ummation was to be at the &s;ame place.</P>
<P>When the hour of connubial felicity ap|proached, her hu&s;band led her to her chamber, and retired through decency, as
<PB N="157" REF="159">
&s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, till &s;he was in bed. He then returned; and having undre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf, and extingui&s;hed the candles, came to her as &s;he thought. But how great was her &s;urpri&s;e in the morning, when &s;he di&s;|cover'd in bed her former lover, and not her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>She flew out of bed, and with the ut|mo&s;t rage called murder! villains! but there were no &s;ervants, no per&s;ons to an|&s;wer to her call; while her ravi&s;her, with all the art of premeditated treachery, en|deavoured to palliate his crime, urging the fervency of his pa&s;&s;ion, and the various means he had, without &s;ucce&s;s, tried to obtain her. The more he rea&s;oned, the more &s;he raved. She called for her hus|band; he an&s;wered not. At length &s;he &s;unk under the oppre&s;&s;ion of calamity; her &s;pirits were exhau&s;ted, and &s;he fell into a &s;woon. When &s;he recovered, her hu&s;band appeared before her, and with a truly &s;y|cophantic air, hoped &s;he was better. Un|able to refrain, even in her then pre&s;ent condition, &s;he upbraided him with his per|fidy. He denied every accu&s;ation, and &s;wore the night had been the mo&s;t joyful
<PB N="158" REF="160">
he had ever had: that no man had been in her chamber but him&s;elf; advi&s;ing her to be a little compo&s;ed, as &s;he was not as yet recovered.</P>
<P>When he perceived &s;he could not be per&s;uaded out of her rea&s;on, he frankly acknowledged the whole plan of villainy; that he was no other than Mr. HAYNES the pimp; that he had been employed by Lord&mdash; to &s;educe her, under pre|tence of marriage; that the ceremony was not lawful; and that he had received five hundred pounds, be&s;ides the reim|bur&s;enrent of all expences, to let his lord|&s;hip, who was &s;ecreted ready in a clo&s;et in her chamber, till &s;uch time as the candles were extingui&s;hed, po&s;&s;e&s;s her the fir&s;t night in his &s;tead.</P>
<P>The pimp, without any attention to her affliction, continued to harangue her on the mo&s;t advi&s;able method of her con|duct. He admoni&s;hed her to endeavour to get into the good graces of his lord&s;hip, as much by her prudent behaviour, as &s;he was by her per&s;on; and he added, that he
<PB N="159" REF="161">
doubted not but his lord&s;hip would make a hand&s;ome provi&s;ion for her.</P>
<P>In this melancholy &s;ituation &s;he wrote her whole unhappy affair, with every mi|nute circum&s;tance, to her father, but did not receive any an&s;wer. She was on the point of &s;etting out for Shrew&s;bury, where her father was at that time, when &s;he was told by a per&s;on, that her relations and friends, would di&s;own her, and have her &s;ecured as a pro&s;tituted vagabond. She therefore re&s;olved to quit her native coun|ry, and endeavour to procure a &s;ub&s;i&s;|tence by &s;ome hone&s;t means among fo|reigners.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s ELLIOT li&s;tened very attentively to the recital of her misfortunes; and when &s;he had made an end, very kindly gave her ten louisd'ors; and, wi&s;hing her &s;ucce&s;s in her undertaking, &s;he took her leave, and pur&s;ued her journey to Calais.</P>
<P>She alighted at the Silver Lyon, and immediately &s;ent one of her &s;ervants to engage a place for her in the packet-boat, which was expected to &s;ail that night.
<PB N="160" REF="162">
The captain of the ve&s;&s;el went to her agreed with her for the pa&s;&s;age, and pro|mi&s;ed to give her proper notice of the time of &s;ailing; and &s;he having ordered &s;upper, went and laid down to re&s;t her&s;elf from the fatigues &s;he had undergone in her journey from Paris.</P>
<P>Supper being ready, &s;he was called, and having eat hearty, &s;he waited the captain's me&s;&s;enger with the news of &s;ailing. He came in about a quarter of an hour after &s;he had &s;upped; &s;he embarked, and in three Hours time was at Dover. Here &s;he went on &s;hore about nine o'clock in the morning, and having hired a po&s;t|chai&s;e, &s;he arrived in London that even|ing.</P>
<P>She had &s;ent Letters to London, to provide genteel lodgings near St. James's, whither, on her arrival, &s;he repaired. Her &s;tay however, in her native country, was very &s;hort; for a few months after, &s;he took a long journey into that unknown land, from <HI>who&s;e bourn no weary traveller returns.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="163">Some years had now pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince &s;he had &s;een her old friend M&mdash;y. She re&s;olv'd therefore to pay him a vi&s;it; and accord|ingly made diligent enquiry to find out the place of his abode. She learned that he lived in Lincoln's-Inn, and having applied him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of the law, was become a &s;olicitor. The day after &s;he receiv'd this welcome news, &s;he dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf in her mo&s;t co&s;tly apparel, and went to &s;ee him.</P>
<P>He did not at fir&s;t recollect who &s;he was; but at length being &s;atisfied in that particular, he &s;lew to her arms with all the raptures of the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate lovers; hung on her neck, &s;mothered her with ki&s;&s;es, and was ob&s;erved by her to &s;hed tears; &s;o much had joy taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his &s;oul. She, on her part, was not back|ward in giving him the mo&s;t convincing proofs of her affection towards him. They then gave each other as &s;uccinct an ac|count, as their memories would allow, of the various accidents which had befallen, during their long ab&s;ence; and concluded with mutually promi&s;ing each other, that
<PB N="162" REF="164">
being once more met together, they would never part.</P>
<P>They vi&s;ited each other almo&s;t every day, and never parted without a&s;&s;urances on both &s;ides of the tender regard they had for each other.</P>
<P>M&mdash;y repre&s;ented to Mi&s;s ELLIOT, that being now rich enough to live in a genteel independence, without re-entering into her former &s;late of life, he thought it highly con&s;i&s;tent with prudence, that &s;he &s;hould make her will, and &s;ettle her con|cerns as &s;oon as convenient. This advice &s;he greatly approved of, and therefore de|&s;ired him to draw it up for her, but he declined the office, le&s;t the cen&s;orious world &s;hould &s;ay that the deed was rather his than that of our heroine.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s ELLIOT applied to an attorney of Gray's Inn, to whom &s;he had been re|commended by M&mdash;y, who for the u&s;ual fee made her one, and &s;he cau&s;ed it to be regi&s;ter'd in the Commons in pro|per form; and this matter being adju&s;ted, &s;he and her old lover went to pa&s;s a few
<PB N="163" REF="165">
days at a country hou&s;e &s;he had hired at Turnham-green, where they pa&s;&s;ed their time in the mo&s;t agreeable manner po&s;&s;ible, till a mo&s;t fatal accident damped their joy and co&s;t Mi&s;s ELLIOT her life.</P>
<P>One day at dinner, having eaten too heartily of a melon, &s;he found her&s;elf out of order, and lay down to try if a little re|po&s;e would be of &s;ervice to her. She got up again in about half an hour, imagin|ing &s;he was better; and the &s;ame night, as &s;he and her lover were in bed, &s;he grew very bad, in&s;omuch that the immediate attendance of a phy&s;ician was indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary. As there was none of note in the place where &s;he then was, Mr. M&mdash;y ordered a &s;ervant to &s;addle him a hor&s;e, and he &s;et out full &s;peed for London, to fetch to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance the able&s;t he could find of the faculty. He returned in about two hours, and brought with him two of the mo&s;t renowned in all their pro&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>When they arrived, they enquired into the origin of Mi&s;s ELLIOT'S di&s;order; and being acquainted with it, they gave it as their opinion, that &s;he ought to be con|veyed
<PB N="164" REF="166">
directly to London, where more proper care would be taken of her than where &s;he was; adding, that this could not be done too &s;oon, as a delay in her removal might be attended with the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences: Their orders were obeyed, and our heroine was carried to London in a chai&s;e; where, being arrived, &s;he was put to bed, and to the great grief of all pre&s;ent, &s;he appeared to grow every hour wor&s;e.</P>
<P>About a week after her return to Lon|don, &s;he &s;eemed rather better, and con|tinued mending for &s;everal days, when the fever, which raged with great violence in her, re&s;umed its former inveteracy: and thus, if I am allowed the expre&s;&s;ion, &s;he continued ebbing and flowing &s;ometimes better, at other times much wor&s;e for a|bove a month. Having continued in this &s;tate for the above mentioned time, her di&s;ea&s;e quite baffled the phy&s;icians art, and they entirely gave her over.</P>
<P>Being made acquainted with the judg|ment the doctors, who had con&s;ulted together on her di&s;order, had pa&s;&s;ed on it,
<PB N="165" REF="167">
and finding that the grim tyrant death was inexorable, &s;he prepared to meet her fate with courage and re&s;ignation.

<P>A pious clergyman attended her in her illne&s;s; and all who were about her had the plea&s;ure to find that &s;he expre&s;&s;ed great compunction for her failings.

<P>When the mini&s;ter had made an end of his prayers and pious exhortations, Mr. M&mdash;y <NOTE PLACE="foot">He came however much again&s;t her will, as appears from her letter to him at the end of this hi&s;tory.</NOTE> went into the chamber, and

kneeling by her bed&s;ide, ki&s;&s;ed her with great earne&s;tne&s;s, and begged of her, that if he had ever di&s;obliged her in any re|&s;pect to forgive him.

<P>Her father and &s;i&s;ter had not the mourn|ful &s;atisfaction of embracing her before &s;he expired.

He refu&s;ed the executor&s;hip of her will, and it de|volved on one of her neare&s;t relations, who acquitted him&s;elf with the greate&s;t honour and integrity. The bulk of her fortune, amounting to near ten thou&s;and pounds, &s;he bequeathed to her indigent relations.</P>
<P>I cannot take leave of my readers with|out making &s;ome few moral reflections on the mi&s;erable condition of tho&s;e unhappy women, who&s;e circum&s;tances oblige them to owe their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to pro&s;titution. They may be con&s;idered in two cla&s;&s;es: The fir&s;t are tho&s;e, who, lo&s;t to every
<PB N="170" REF="172">
&s;en&s;e or virtue, are engaged in this dete&s;|table way of life by choice: others are under the cruel nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubmitting to all the evils which attend the life of pro&s;ti|tutes, becau&s;e they are abandoned by their parents, relations, friends, and acquain|tance, for having too ea&s;ily li&s;tened to the delu&s;ive per&s;ua&s;ions of the deceiver, man; which generally terminate in the de&s;truction of tho&s;e unhappy girls, who are too ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to their own ruin. How many are there now in our &s;treets, who once knew the happine&s;s of treading the paths of virtue, but who are now im|merged in the gulph of wickedne&s;s, de|&s;erred by all who knew them, for one fal&s;e &s;tep; which perhaps was more owing to the influence which &s;ome villain had over their innocent and inexperienced minds, than to a natural inclination for vice. Many of the&s;e would with joy embrace any opportunity which offers of getting bread in &s;ome other &s;hape, rather than continue any longer in their pre&s;ent mi&s;ery. The wi&s;dom of our legi&s;lature has taken this into con&s;ideration, and a proper place has been provided for the reception of &s;uch as were found willing to reform their aban|doned
<PB N="171" REF="173">
lives; and we &s;ee the &s;alutary ef|effects of this in&s;titution, by the rapid pro|gre&s;s already made in the reclaiming of a great many. Oh man! how can&s;t thou with &s;uch glaring impudence look up to heaven, the &s;eat of the Almighty, after having &s;o &s;hamefully effected the ruin of the faire&s;t part of the creation, by robbing, them of the mo&s;t ine&s;timable trea&s;ure they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, their virtue; and thereby &s;ub|jected them to a life of di&s;order and mi&s;ery, which mu&s;t inevitably terminate in de&s;pair. How deplorable is the &s;itua|tion of tho&s;e who have been hurried on to their own ruin in this world, and eternal perdition in the next. I could wi&s;h that a law were enacted, obliging every man who thus &s;educes a virtuous girl, either to marry the object of their lu&s;t, or make &s;uch a provi&s;ion for her as would entirely, &s;creen her from the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeking a livelihood by becoming a common pro&s;ti|tute; or el&s;e be condemned to immediate death, after lawful conviction of the crime.</P>
<P>It may be objected that many would do this, but through indigence of cir|cum&s;tances
<PB N="172" REF="174">
are incapable of it. Let them con&s;ider before hand, for in this ca&s;e no|thing ought to &s;helter them from the pu|ni&s;hment they incur by thus effecting the ruin of an innocent young woman. If this proceeding were once adopted, how many women, who at pre&s;ent are a &s;can|dal to their &s;ex, would then live ornaments to human &s;ociety, and their beauty and virtue would be revered by all who are any way connected with them.</P>
<P>The other cla&s;s of unhappy women is compo&s;ed of &s;uch who are &s;o by their own choice: and even &s;ome of the&s;e are in|bebted for their fir&s;t introduction to wick|edne&s;s, to the traitor man. Others there are indeed, who have been the fir&s;t to &s;oli|cit our &s;ex to ruin them. But let the&s;e reflect, that con&s;cience is the faithful re|gi&s;ter of all our actions, the unbia&s;&s;ed wit|ne&s;s of our conduct, and the equitable judge of all we do. When con&s;cience ap|proves of our actions, we find in it a re|&s;ource in all our afflictions, we are helped by it to &s;upport under the weight of mis|fortunes; and we are thereby a&s;&s;ured of
<PB N="173" REF="175">
one day being admitted to a participation of eternal joys.</P>
<P>On the contrary, when con&s;cience con|demns us, the &s;entence is followed by re|mor&s;e, by puni&s;hments, by de&s;pair, which will inevitably plunge us; at the la&s;t day, into an aby&s;s of endle&s;s mi&s;ery, where, as the poet Tibullus beautifully expre&s;&s;es it,</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Prolixa jacet &s;edes in nocte profunda.</L>
<L>Abdita, quacircum, flumina nigra &s;onant,</L></Q>
<P>Or, as Horace &s;ays,</P>
<Q><L>&mdash; Hic murus aheneus e&s;to,</L>
<L>Nil con&s;cire &s;ibi, nulla pal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e culpa.</L></Q>
<P>We ought not therefore to judge of the rectitude or depravity of our actions, by the dictamen of our unbridled pa&s;&s;ions; but &s;ubmit them to the deci&s;ion of con&s;ci|ence. The &s;upreme beings, creator of all things, has given us it, as the infallible rule whereby we are to regulate our lives.</P>
<P>This being therefore the ca&s;e, how great mu&s;t be the inward torment of &s;uch wo|men as are ingulphed in this fathomle&s;s &s;ea of wickedne&s;s! What would they not give.
<PB N="174" REF="176">
to enjoy one hour's tranquillity of mind! But this is denied them; and the only re|&s;ource they have left is to have recour&s;e ro &s;trong liquors, as often as tho&s;e thoughts enter their minds, in order to drown the remembrance of what would infallibly make them run mad, did they &s;uffer them&s;elves to think coolly on it.</P>
<P>Although they were to &s;uffer nothing in the next world; although their &s;ouls were not immortal; yet the mi&s;eries which attend them, would be &s;ufficient, one would imagine, to deter them from continuing in their pre&s;ent wicked cour&s;e. How of|ten are they obliged to walk the &s;treets all the night; &s;ubject to the inclemency of the &s;ea&s;on, de&s;titute of a lodging, nor ha|ving money to procure one: hungry and cold, without hopes of relief; kicked by any drunken rake who &s;hall think fit to treat them in that barbarous manner. How many of them rot in an ho&s;pital! Some even turned out from tho&s;e recep|tacles of the indi&s;po&s;ed, at la&s;t have fini&s;h|ed their days on a dunghill. What hor|rors of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> mu&s;t they experience in their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 words">, when their guilty con|&s;ciences
<PB N="175" REF="177">
reproach them with all their wick|edne&s;s? What indignation mu&s;t they not conceive again&s;t them&s;elves for having brought &s;o many ills on their own heads? How bitter the reflection of having cur|tailed their own life by incontinency? How will they cur&s;e the hour in which they fir&s;t pro&s;tituted their lovely bodies, de&s;igned for the enjoyment of the cha&s;te joys of holy matrimony. In &s;hort tho&s;e only who have been in this unhappy &s;tate can form a ju&s;t idea of it.</P>
<P>Since therefore the life of a woman of this character is &s;o replete with misfortune; whether &s;he be &s;uch by choice or nece&s;&s;ity, take warning ye unguarded fair! Li&s;ten not to the fal&s;e per&s;ua&s;ive voice of tho&s;e would lead you to ruin. Be deaf to all their prote&s;tations of love: pay no regard to their oaths and imprecations, much le&s;s to their promi&s;es of marrying you, after they enjoy your per&s;ons; for you may be certain they will deceive you. They only do this to deceive you, for they never (or at lea&s;t very rarely happens) will con&s;ent to take her for a wife, who could &s;o ea&s;ily-con&s;ent to their embraces, before
<PB N="176" REF="178">
marriage. They cannot be induced to believe that a woman will ever be faithful to them after &s;uch a &s;tep; and even &s;ome de&s;pi&s;e the poor deluded fair, who ra&s;hly complied with their de&s;ires. Man is in &s;ome &s;en&s;e the mo&s;t rational of the creation. Few are able to curb the impetuo&s;ity of the &s;en&s;ual appetite which is common to them with brutes, and they may be &s;aid to be lions, who go up and down &s;eeking whom they may devour.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, ye deluded fair, the &s;hortne&s;s of your Life. This is generally forgotten in the &s;lumber of wickedne&s;s. So deeply is the love of plea&s;ure rooted in mens hearts, and &s;o &s;trongly guarded by hope and fear again&s;t the approach of rea&s;on, that nei|ther &s;cience nor experience can &s;hake it, and they act as if life was without end, though they &s;ee and confe&s;s its uncertain|ty and &s;hortne&s;s.</P>
<P>If it has been your misfortune ever to be engaged in a life of wickedne&s;s, repent now, you yet have time. It is the &s;ame weakne&s;s now to defer repenting of your &s;ins, in proportion to the importance of
<PB N="177" REF="179">
the neglect, as to defer any care, which now claims your attention, to a future time. You cannot promi&s;e your&s;elves long life; and even though you could, it is ea&s;ier to conceive &s;orrow for a few failings, than when the &s;oul, by a long uninter|rupted cour&s;e of &s;in, is, as it were, co|vered all over with a callus; for although the motives of repentance are &s;o much the &s;tronger in proportion as the offences a|gain&s;t the great Creator of mankind are heinous, or numerous, yet, when the heart is hardened, it is with the greate&s;t di&s;&s;iculty made to receive any impre&s;&s;ion of piety.</P>
<P>Let the errors and follies, the dangers and infelicity of that &s;tate, &s;ink deep into your hearts. Remember, that human life is the journey of a day. We ri&s;e in the morning of youth, full of vigour, and full of expectation: We &s;et forward with &s;pirit and hope, with gaiety and daily care, and travel a while in the &s;traight road of piety towards the man&s;ions of re&s;t: in a &s;hort time we remit our fervour, and en|deavour to find &s;ome mitigation of our duty, and &s;ome more ea&s;y means of ob|taining
<PB N="178" REF="180">
the &s;ame end. We then relax our vigour, and re&s;olve no longer to be terri|fied with crimes at a di&s;tance, but rely on our own con&s;tancy, and venture to ap|proach what we re&s;olve never to touch.</P>
<P>We are then willing to enquire whether another advance cannot be made; and whether we may not at lea&s;t, turn our eyes upon the gardens of plea&s;ure. We ap|proach them with &s;cruple and he&s;itation: we enter them, but enter timorous and trembling, and always hope to pa&s;s thro' them without lo&s;ing the road of virtue, which we for a while keep in our &s;ight, and to which we purpo&s;e to return.</P>
<P>But temptation &s;ucceeds temptation; and one compliance prepares for another. We in time lo&s;e the happine&s;s of innocence, and &s;olace our di&s;quiet with &s;en&s;ual gratifi|cations. By degrees we let fall the re|membrance of our original intention, and quit the only object of rational de&s;ire. We entangle our&s;elves in bu&s;ine&s;s, immerge our&s;elves in luxury, and rove through the labyrinth of incon&s;tancy, till the darkne&s;s of old age begins to invade us, and di&s;ea&s;es
<PB N="179" REF="181">
and anxiety ob&s;truct our way. We then look back on our lives with horror, with &s;orrow, with repentance, and wi&s;h, but too often vainly wi&s;h, that we had not for|&s;aken the ways of virtue. Happy are they who learn from example not to be wicked.</P>
<P>I hope my readers will excu&s;e the pro|lixity I have u&s;ed in penning the above. I have now done, and I mu&s;t beg them to receive this as written only with a view of conveying delight with in&s;truction, and to wean tho&s;e unhappy females from vice who are enthralled in it; and guard tho&s;e again&s;t it, who are as yet unacquainted with guilt. How I have &s;ucceeded is left to the impartial public, who I humbly hope will receive it with that candour with which they approve of any attempt to yield them plea&s;ure or &s;atisfaction.</P>
