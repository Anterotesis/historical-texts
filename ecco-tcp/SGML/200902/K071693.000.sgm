<HEAD>HOUSE OF COMMONS. <DATE>FRIDAY, JULY 16, 1784.</DATE></HEAD>
<OPENER>"THE order of the day being read, for the Hou&s;e to re&s;olve it&s;elf into a Committee of the whole Hou&s;e, upon the Bill for the better regulation and management of the affairs of the Ea&s;t-India Company, and of the Briti&s;h po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions in India, and for e&s;tabli&s;hing a Court of Judicature for the more &s;peedy and effectual trial of per&s;ons accu&s;ed of offences committed in the Ea&s;t Indies; the Speaker put the que&s;tion, <HI>That he &s;hould now leave the chair?</HI>"</OPENER>
<HEAD>Mr. FRANCIS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. SPEAKER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am &s;orry that I mu&s;t be obliged to oppo&s;e your leaving the chair. My opinion of the bill will not allow me to con&s;ent to its going to a Committee; for I not only think it materially de|fective
<PB N="2" REF="3">
in the detail, but liable to fundamental and e&s;&s;ential objections. Particular provi&s;ions might be added, improved, or omitted; but objections, that go to the foundation and e&s;&s;ence of the bill, are not to be removed by any alterations, that would not make it compleatly a new one. I have atten|tively con&s;idered the &s;ubject; and I mean, if the Hou&s;e will permit me, to &s;ubmit to you my opinion of it, more at large than I &s;hould venture to do any other. I mean to examine the principles as well as the provi&s;ions of the bill;&mdash;a ta&s;k, I fear, not to be performed without a long and a tedious di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. To <HI>me</HI> the ta&s;k is particularly heavy, but I am bound to undertake it by many obliga|tions. The labour we are engaged in does not offer <HI>me</HI> the &s;ame hopes, which it may have &s;ug|ge&s;ted to others: I am not encouraged to engage in it by a &s;anguine expectation of &s;ucce&s;s. I very much fear, that the object of our pre&s;ent delibera|tion is dead. You have neglected it too long. You have &s;uffered it to fall into a &s;tate of ruin from which, I fear, no remedy within the reach of human wi&s;dom can recover it. But a great authority, un|der which I had the honour and good fortune to be bred, has taught me, <HI>that duty may &s;urvive hope.&mdash;</HI>On this principle alone, I am &s;till ready to take my &s;hare in the duty, though I cannot partake in any hope of its &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The views and principles of the bill may natu|rally and properly be divided into three di&s;tinct ge|neral heads.&mdash;Fir&s;t, the new arrangement and di&s;|tribution
<PB N="3" REF="4">
of power at home, with all its probable effects and influence on our dome&s;tic government.&mdash;On this part of the &s;ubject I &s;hall confine my&s;elf &s;trictly to the fact, which I think will be ea&s;ily e&s;tabli&s;hed, that there is a compleat and ab&s;olute transfer of the whole power and patronage of the Ea&s;t-India Company into the hands of the Crown. Of the effects of this transfer of power, of its pro|bable influence on our own Government, and of the danger with which it may threaten the Con&s;ti|tution of England, I do not mean to offer an opinion. If tho&s;e topics have not already been &s;uf|ficiently di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, they properly belong to the de|partment, and &s;hould be re&s;erved for the employ|ment of the greate&s;t abilities in this country. A right honourable gentleman near me will do ju&s;tice to the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The &s;econd divi&s;ion of the bill includes the ar|rangements and regulations intended for the Go|vernments abroad; and on this I &s;hall hope to be permitted to enlarge. Without pretending to &s;u|perior qualifications, or pre&s;uming to dictate to the wi&s;dom of the Hou&s;e, I am per&s;uaded you will li&s;ten to information, which only profe&s;&s;es to be de|rived from experience.</P>
<P>The third divi&s;ion regards the new plan of cri|minal judicature propo&s;ed to be introduced into England, for trying offences committed in India. On this la&s;t point my opinion will not be delivered in many words, but the words that I make u&s;e of &s;hall be the &s;tronge&s;t I can find.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5">
Sir, There are two preliminary ob&s;ervations, which ari&s;e on a general view of the bill, and which I wi&s;h the Hou&s;e to carry along with them, through the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of all the parts of it. Fir&s;t, that the whole bill on the face of it is remedial; that it is a remedy of a new and violent nature, nece&s;&s;ary perhaps, but nece&s;&s;ary only on the &s;uppo&s;ition of &s;ome great and inveterate di&s;orders, both at home and abroad, which, though con&s;tantly implied, are no where &s;tated.</P>
<P>Secondly, Sir, admitting &s;uch di&s;orders to exi&s;t, I think it will appear, through the whole plan of the bill, that the remedy applied is in every in&s;tance directly the rever&s;e of what the di&s;order requires. With re&s;pect to the Governments abroad, the ac|knowledged grievance is, that the powers, hitherto intru&s;ted, have been gro&s;&s;ly and notoriou&s;ly abu&s;ed. But you will find that, in the contemplation of this bill, the true and natural remedy for an abu&s;e of power is to increa&s;e it. With re&s;pect to the Com|pany's Government at home, the con&s;tant complaint of the Directors has been, that their power over their &s;ervants was too feeble to enforce obedience, that their authority was di&s;regarded, and their orders avowedly and con&s;tantly di&s;obeyed. You have facts in abundance, reported to you by your Committees, to &s;atisfy the Hou&s;e that the&s;e complaints of the Directors are perfectly well founded. Now, Sir, in the contemplation of this bill, the remedy for di&s;obedience of orders is to &s;trengthen the power that di&s;obeys; and when in&s;ulted authority calls for
<PB N="5" REF="6">
&s;upport, either, in effect to reduce it to nothing, or, what is &s;till wor&s;e, to &s;uffer it to exi&s;t and to make it contemptible. The pretended power, left in the hands of the Directors, is a mockery of the degraded &s;tate of tho&s;e unfortunate gentlemen. It is wor&s;e than u&s;ele&s;s; for &s;ince, in fact, they are only to be the channel of the operations of a &s;uperior power, you dimini&s;h even that power, which un|que&s;tionably the bill propo&s;es to e&s;tabli&s;h, and ex|po&s;e it to &s;hare in the contempt attached to the medium, through which it is to act. In the&s;e ob|&s;ervations I mean only to &s;tate the general re&s;ult and impre&s;&s;ion of the bill, without immediately re|ferring to the &s;pecific evidence, from which they are deduced. The &s;horte&s;t and cleare&s;t way to e&s;tabli&s;h the truth of them is to enter at once into the detail of the bill, and to follow it as it goes.</P>
<P>Sir, the very out&s;et of the bill is e&s;&s;entially de|fective. When an act of legi&s;lative power is applied to the total alteration of an exi&s;ting Government, it mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;uch Govern|ment is either radically corrupt, or unfaithfully ad|mini&s;tered. No man, I pre&s;ume, will di&s;pute that &s;uch is the fact in the general government of the Ea&s;t-India Company's affairs. The pre&s;ent bill, through every part of it, &s;uppo&s;es what it no where avows, that nothing le&s;s than a vigorous interpo&s;ition of the Legi&s;lature can &s;ave the object. For aught that appears in the preamble of this act, where the general grounds of it &s;hould naturally be &s;et forth, the territorial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, for who&s;e <HI>better</HI> govern|ment
<PB N="6" REF="7">
we are going to provide, may be perfectly well governed at pre&s;ent. For want of this e&s;&s;ential preliminary, the whole body of the bill is in ef|fect a conclu&s;ion without premi&s;es, a remedy without a di&s;ea&s;e, a penalty without a crime. The omi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a preamble to &s;uch a bill as this will appear extraordinary as well as improper, to tho&s;e who re|collect with how much force and energy the Chan|cellor of the Exchequer, in opening the plan and principles of the bill, in&s;i&s;ted on the magnitude of tho&s;e crimes and abu&s;es, which demanded and ju&s;|tified a proportionate effort of power to puni&s;h or correct them. He was not very re&s;erved in his de|&s;cription of the offenders, or of their offences, but painted them both in the blacke&s;t colours. It is much to be regretted, that the &s;ub&s;tance, at lea&s;t, of his opinion of Indian delinquency &s;hould be no where recorded for the benefit of his friends.</P>
<P>The new Board of Commi&s;&s;ioners for the affairs of India is to con&s;i&s;t of certain Members of His Maje&s;ty's Privy Council, and they are to be inve&s;ted with the &s;uperintendence and control over all the Briti&s;h territorial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the Ea&s;t Indies, <HI>and over the affairs of the United Company of Merchants trading thereto.</HI> The powers, conveyed by the latter part of this clau&s;e, evidently and expre&s;&s;ly include the Company's commerce. The affairs of a Com|pany of Merchants trading to India can only be commercial. Let the Court of Directors look to it. I am perfectly aware, that in a &s;ub&s;equent clau&s;e it is provided, that if the Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;end any or|ders
<PB N="7" REF="8">
to the Court of Directors, which, in their opi|nion, &s;hall relate to points not connected with the territorial government or revenues, they may apply to the King in Council for redre&s;s; that is, if they are di&s;&s;atisfied with the judgement of His Ma|je&s;ty's Mini&s;ters at one Board, they may appeal to His Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;ters at another. The power given is unlimited. The appeal again&s;t the exer|ci&s;e of it is nugatory.</P>
<P>The Court of Directors are to be governed and bound by the orders they receive from the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners; and are not to &s;end di&s;patches of any kind to India, without their previous approbation.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners may &s;end their own orders originally to the Directors, who are obliged to in|&s;ert &s;uch orders in their di&s;patches, pur&s;uant to the <HI>tenor</HI> thereof; that is, in the &s;ame words.</P>
<P>If the Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould be of opinion that the ca&s;e requires &s;ecrecy, they may &s;end their own orders directly to the Governments in India, with|out any communication with the Court of Directors, who are not to be tru&s;ted even with the knowledge of mea&s;ures, in which the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts, the &s;afety, and, perhaps, the exi&s;tence of the India Company may be involved. In the &s;ame clau&s;e, the Commi&s;&s;ioners may not only &s;end their orders to the Governments abroad without the knowledge of the Directors, but, what is much more extraordi|nary, and much more alarming, they may &s;end &s;e|cret in&s;tructions to the Commanders in Chief in In|dia, independent of the Civil Government on the
<PB N="8" REF="9">
&s;pot. If there be no mi&s;take in the con&s;truction of this clau&s;e; if it be &s;eriou&s;ly intended to give this power to the Mini&s;ters of the Crown, there is no clau&s;e in the bill that more urgently demands the attention of the Hou&s;e. By another clau&s;e, the no|mination and appointment of all the Commanders in Chief in India, and of per&s;ons to &s;ucceed to the command in ca&s;e of vacancy, are directly ve&s;ted in the Crown; and the&s;e officers are required to obey whatever orders they receive from the King's Mi|ni&s;ters, not only independent of the Directors at home, but of the Civil Government of the Pre&s;i|dency to which they belong. I &s;tate the facts as I find them, and &s;hall leave them without comment to the judgement of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The general patronage of the Company is pro|fe&s;&s;edly left with the Court of Directors, but with exceptions and re&s;trictions which really reduce it to nothing. The Commanders in Chief and their im|mediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, at all the Pre&s;idencies, are to be under the immediate appointment of the Crown. By this provi&s;ion the military is &s;eparated from the civil power of the Company's government. The Court of Directors, who pay the army, and who&s;e general authority over it is apparently continued, can neither appoint, nor remove the per&s;ons who command it.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the offices of Governor General, Pre&s;idents, and Members of the &s;everal Councils in India, the Directors, it is true, may nominate and appoint: but it de&s;erves to be con&s;idered, that they
<PB N="9" REF="10">
who appoint are not permitted to remove; that power is exclu&s;ively ve&s;ted in the Crown; and even the pretended power of appointing to the&s;e offices is ineffectual. Their nomination is to be &s;ubject to his Maje&s;ty's approbation. If the King di&s;approves, the Directors mu&s;t proceed to another nomination; and &s;o on, <HI>toties quoties,</HI> until per&s;ons &s;hall be ap|pointed <HI>who &s;hall be approved by His Maje&s;ty.</HI> This is the way, in which the patronage of all the princi|pal offices in India is di&s;po&s;ed of. All other promo|tions, civil and military, are to be made according to &s;eniority of appointment in a regular progre&s;&s;ive &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and the Directors are prohibited from &s;ending out any new &s;ervants, civil or military, un|til certain e&s;tabli&s;hments &s;hall be completed, and then, only to fill up the vacancies that may happen therein. I do not mean to blame the&s;e la&s;t regula|tions: but, if all the preceding exceptions and li|mitations are combined, it is evident, that no real patronage will be left with the Directors, or, at the utmo&s;t, a patronage to operate upon trifles. Not &s;o the powers given to the Commi&s;&s;ioners. In every department of the Company's affairs, <HI>their</HI> direct authority, or their indirect influence, is real and ef|fective. On the real principles of this bill, whether acknowledged or not, the Court of Directors ought to be aboli&s;hed. To leave a &s;hadow of power after the &s;ub&s;tance of it is gone, is to e&s;tabli&s;h a contra|diction, which can only do mi&s;chief. Whenever the con&s;titution of any government is e&s;&s;entially al|tered, the forms &s;hould not be allowed to &s;urvive
<PB N="10" REF="11">
the e&s;&s;ence. Under the &s;helter of the&s;e forms, things will be done, or duties will be neglected, for which no man will be re&s;pon&s;ible. No de&s;poti&s;m was ever &s;o &s;evere as that, which exi&s;ted in the form of a republic. In whatever degree the powers re|&s;erved to the Directors are effective, they can only be productive of mi&s;chievous effects. They can only cla&s;h with, and retard the operations of the &s;u|perior Board, and furni&s;h them both with pretences for accu&s;ing each other of whatever may happen ami&s;s.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, I &s;ubmit it to the Hou&s;e, to deter|mine whether my fir&s;t propo&s;ition be not &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed, that in every &s;en&s;e in which power can be &s;u&s;picious, in which power can be mi&s;chievous to the thing &s;ubject to it, or dangerous to objects not immediately connected with it, there is by this bill a complete and ab&s;olute transfer of power from the India Company to the Crown. <HI>I</HI> con&s;ider it only as it affects the Government of India, and &s;hall pur&s;ue the remaining clau&s;es in the order in which they &s;tand.</P>
<P>I have already taken the liberty of ob&s;erving to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that the bill makes no provi&s;ion for the &s;ituation of a Comman|der in Chief of all the Company's forces in India. The office exi&s;ts, though it be not actually filled up, and it ought to be provided for. That officer has always had a &s;eat in the Supreme Council; of cour&s;e, there mu&s;t be a mi&s;take in the &s;eventeenth clau&s;e, which gives voice and precedence in Council
<PB N="11" REF="12">
to the Commander in Chief of the Pre&s;idency of Fort William, as if he had a &s;eat there, which, in fact, he never had. The mi&s;take mu&s;t be cor|rected.</P>
<P>From the terms of the nineteenth clau&s;e, I con|clude that Lord Macartney is to be removed from the Government of Fort St. George; that is, that he is to be &s;acrificed to the views and re&s;entments of the Government of Bengal. I have not the ho|nour of knowing Lord Macartney, nor have I a connection with him of any kind: but, in order to be convinced that the noble Lord has done his duty, it is &s;ufficient for me to know who the per&s;ons are, and what the combination is, that are united again&s;t him. By a different cour&s;e of conduct, <HI>their</HI> enmity is not to be incurred. The moment I knew the fact, I drew the conclu&s;ion&mdash;I fore&s;aw the con&s;e|quence, and foretold it to his friends: <HI>This man is doing his duty, and a&s;&s;uredly he'll be recalled for it.</HI> Comparing this clau&s;e with another that relates to Fort William, the Hou&s;e will ob&s;erve, that in Ben|gal, which is the &s;eat of power, and where, if mi&s;|chief has been done in India, the &s;ource of it mu&s;t exi&s;t, there is to be no change of hands; but, in the &s;ubordinate &s;ettlements, there is to be an univer&s;al &s;weep.</P>
<P>The wi&s;dom and nece&s;&s;ity of the thirtieth clau&s;e, by which the General Court of Proprietors are re|&s;trained from interfering with <HI>any act, order, re&s;olu|tion, matter, or proceeding of the Court of Directors,</HI> will, in this Hou&s;e at lea&s;t, be generally acknow|ledged.
<PB N="12" REF="13">
All parties, I believe, are agreed on the nece&s;&s;ity of putting an end to the cabals of that a&s;|&s;embly. Every bill, from every quarter, that has hitherto been propo&s;ed for the better regulation of the Company's affairs, makes &s;pecial provi&s;ion for this favourite object. I therefore give the clau&s;e my entire and hearty approbation. At the &s;ame time, Sir, I cannot help ob&s;erving, that the prin|ciple and object of this provi&s;ion is not to be recon|ciled to the language, or rather to the cry, by which a bill that pa&s;&s;ed the Hou&s;e of Commons la&s;t year was run down, and the honourable per&s;on who moved it, for a moment di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his popu|larity, and driven from his &s;tation. If the rights conveyed by an exclu&s;ive charter be in their nature <HI>&s;acred,</HI> they can no more be invaded in part, than they can be wholly re&s;umed. If the charter it&s;elf be <HI>&s;acred,</HI> it ought to be <HI>inviolable;</HI> or, if any part of it be more e&s;&s;entially <HI>&s;acred</HI> than the re&s;t, it mu&s;t be that, which &s;ecures to the Proprietors the con|trol and direction of their own affairs. In this re|&s;pect, the pre&s;ent bill adopts the very &s;ame princi|ple, by which a much better was defeated. It a&s;|&s;umes a di&s;cretion, where, on the profe&s;&s;ed princi|ples of tho&s;e who defend it, there &s;hould be none. It takes or leaves ju&s;t as much of the Company's charter, as &s;uits the purpo&s;es of the pre&s;ent Admi|ni&s;tration.</P>
<P>The object of the thirty-&s;econd clau&s;e is proper. The &s;ubordinate Pre&s;idencies &s;hould either be de|pendent on the &s;uperintendence and control of the
<PB N="13" REF="14">
Governor General and Council in <HI>all</HI> ca&s;es, or to|tally exempt from it. We know by experience, that an attempt to &s;ubject them to a <HI>partial</HI> control is not likely to &s;ucceed. We know that it has hi|therto produced no good effect. On the other hand, it is evidently ab&s;urd and hazardous, that the mem|bers of one &s;tate, and the parts of one &s;y&s;tem, &s;hould not be united under one power, whenever they are to act, and not move together under a &s;ingle direc|tion. There is no alternative, therefore, but to e&s;tabli&s;h a general authority at Fort William, and to in&s;i&s;t on a general &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to it: but, at the &s;ame time, let care be taken to unite the powers, and &s;trengthen the authority at home in the &s;ame proportion.</P>
<P>The thirty-third clau&s;e is &s;o very incorrect and ob&s;cure, that, I confe&s;s, I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee it tran&s;lated into common &s;en&s;e. It is &s;aid, that the rules, ordinances, and regulations, which the Go|vernor General and Council are empowered to i&s;&s;ue, &s;hall extend to all rules, ordinances, and regulations made by the &s;aid Governor General and Council. If this be not po&s;itively non&s;en&s;e, it is, at lea&s;t, an extraordinary way of removing all former <HI>que&s;tions and doubts</HI> upon the &s;ubject. Whoever drew up the clau&s;e evidently knew nothing of the matter. So far from explaining the que&s;tions, or removing the doubts to which he alludes, he does not even know what they were, nor what they referred to. The only que&s;tion that ever aro&s;e in Bengal, con|cerning the power granted by the act of 1773 to the
<PB N="14" REF="15">
Governor General and Council, to make rules and ordinances for the &s;ettlement of Fort William, was, to what <HI>things,</HI> to what <HI>&s;ubject matter,</HI> and not to what per&s;ons or places, the power extended; and this, indeed, is a doubt which it would be proper to clear up. If it be intended to give a general le|gi&s;lative power, the terms you make u&s;e of mu&s;t be much more comprehen&s;ive and much more explicit.</P>
<P>The thirty-&s;eventh clau&s;e declares, that <HI>to pur&s;ue &s;chemes of conque&s;t, and exten&s;ion of dominion in India, are mea&s;ures repugnant to the wi&s;h, the honour, and policy of this nation.</HI> Sir, I wi&s;h to &s;ee a propo&s;ition &s;o full of truth and wi&s;dom, not only acknowledged, but enforced. In this mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential view, the plan of the bill is mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially defective. It alludes to facts and offences which are not &s;tated, and to criminals whom, &s;o far from attempting to puni&s;h, it does not even venture to de&s;cribe. If &s;uch facts and criminals do not exi&s;t, the whole bill is a &s;u|perfluity built upon a fal&s;ehood. It &s;uppo&s;es ima|ginary di&s;orders, for the imaginary merit of correct|ing them. But if they really exi&s;t, it is in vain to expect that they will be checked or prevented by the empty threats of a Legi&s;lature, that contents it|&s;elf with piling up laws upon laws, and regulations on regulations&mdash;of a Legi&s;lature, that never has hitherto been obeyed, yet always looks forward to future obedience. Reward and puni&s;hment are the right and left hand of Government. It is the office of the head to frame and denounce the law, but it is the hand that mu&s;t enforce it. In another point
<PB N="15" REF="16">
of view, the bill is unju&s;t as well as impotent. It makes no di&s;tinction between tho&s;e per&s;ons, who have uniformly acted on the principles you approve, and others, who have uniformly acted on the principles you condemn. In not &s;tating <HI>any</HI> to be innocent, it &s;uppo&s;es <HI>all</HI> to be guilty. Now, Sir, I &s;hall do what the mover of the bill has not had courage to do. I attach re&s;pon&s;ibility to power, and I affirm, that, at the end of the year 1777, the whole political power of the Briti&s;h empire in India, nominally ve&s;ted in the Governor General and Council, was really and &s;ub|&s;tantially ve&s;ted in Mr. Ha&s;tings. If Mr. Ha&s;tings, &s;upported by one Member of the Supreme Council again&s;t the other two, be not exclu&s;ively re&s;pon&s;ible for the war which was undertaken at that period, for the <HI>avowed</HI> purpo&s;e of conque&s;t and exten&s;ion of dominion, which carried de&s;olation with it wherever it extended, and which has ended in the ruin of the Ea&s;t-India Company, it is fit that Parliament and the nation &s;hould know, nay, it is the duty of Par|liament to inquire, who was the author of the war, and who is to be an&s;werable for it. Facts, it will be &s;aid, may be very differently repre&s;ented, and variou&s;ly accounted for, e&s;pecially at &s;o great a di&s;|tance as from India to England. Sir, I well know the facility, with which facts at &s;uch a di&s;tance may be &s;tated to advantage. But principles formally de|clared, and deliberately avowed, are not to be di&s;|gui&s;ed or retracted. They &s;tand for public judge|ment, and they demand it. If the Hou&s;e have any doubt about the fact, let them look to the acknow|ledged
<PB N="16" REF="17">
principles of the per&s;on, to whom the fact is imputed. Does Mr. Ha&s;tings him&s;elf deny, that conque&s;t and extent of dominion were his object in the pur&s;uit of the Maratta war? No, Sir; he avows it. Let him an&s;wer for him&s;elf. I will not run the ri&s;que of doing him an inju&s;tice.</P>

<P>In the&s;e explicit words you have all the policy and all the ju&s;tice of the Maratta war: <HI>If we have &s;uffered lo&s;&s;es in the We&s;t, let us repair them in the Ea&s;t; wherever we are powerful, it is our bu&s;ine&s;s to attack.</HI> Surely, Sir, if no other evidence exi&s;ted, it would not be very unrea&s;onable to pre&s;ume, that Mr. Ha&s;tings's mea&s;ures have been formed on the principles he profe&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>I am ready to admit that the clau&s;e in que&s;tion does all that can be done, by mere legi&s;lative prohi|bition, to put a &s;top to &s;uch mea&s;ures in future. Yet I very much fear that the general rule will be defeated by the exception that attends it. The Governor General and Council are not to make war, or to commence ho&s;tilities again&s;t any of the coun|try
<PB N="17" REF="18">
powers, <HI>unle&s;s &s;uch powers &s;hall be actually making preparations for the commencement of ho&s;tilities</HI> again&s;t us or our allies. I beg leave to a&s;&s;ure the Hou&s;e, that whenever the Governor General and Council are di&s;po&s;ed to make war upon their neighbours, they can at all times fabricate a ca&s;e to &s;uit their purpo&s;e, and &s;end home a ma&s;s of incontrovertible evidence to &s;upport it.&mdash;The exception in the next clau&s;e, by which a &s;imilar latitude is given to Fort St. George and Bombay, is not &s;o dangerous, be|cau&s;e tho&s;e Pre&s;idencies are nearer to a power that may control them. They cannot make war, if the Governor General and Council be &s;eriou&s;ly deter|mined again&s;t it. But again I tell you, that one example is worth a hundred laws.</P>
<P>I am not very conver&s;ant with the affairs of the coa&s;t of Coromandel, and therefore &s;hall offer but a &s;ingle ob&s;ervation on the &s;everal clau&s;es that relate to the liquidation of the debts due to Briti&s;h &s;ub|jects from the Nabob of Arcot, the Rajah of Tan|jore, and any other of the native protected princes in India. The labour of inquiring into and liqui|dating the&s;e debts, which the bill impo&s;es on the Governor General and Council, in addition to their own immediate duties, will be very heavy, and, I believe, equally u&s;ele&s;s. They may adju&s;t the ac|count; but I have no conception how the debts are to be paid out of an exhau&s;ted revenue, and a ruin|ed country. I believe it to be impo&s;&s;ible, unle&s;s a preference is to be given to the private debts before
<PB N="18" REF="19">
tho&s;e of the Company, which, I pre&s;ume, is not intended.</P>
<P>The final &s;ettlement of the pre&s;ent indeterminate rights and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Nabob of Arcot and the Rajah of Tanjore, with re&s;pect to each other, is a ju&s;t, a nece&s;&s;ary, and an attainable object. The principles, on which the &s;ettlement is to be made, appear to me to be the be&s;t that could be adopted. But I mo&s;t &s;trongly object to, and prote&s;t again&s;t the idea of leaving the execution of the mea&s;ure to the Governor General and Council. The power, which predominates in that Government, is noto|riou&s;ly partial to the Nabob of Arcot, and ho&s;tile to the Rajah of Tanjore. The tribunal, to which you refer the parties, is prejudiced in favour of the &s;tronger of the two, and, if its intentions were over &s;o upright, &s;hould not be tru&s;ted with the power of judging between them. Neither is it ne|ce&s;&s;ary. There is no que&s;tion of right between the contending parties, which may not be decided as properly and as effectually in England as it can be in Bengal. The Court of Directors have all the materials before them: they may determine the points in di&s;pure, and &s;end their orders directly to the Pre&s;ident and Council of Fort St. George, to carry their deci&s;ion into effect. If they <HI>can</HI> do it, they <HI>ought</HI> to do it.</P>
<P>On a &s;imilar principle of rea&s;on and ju&s;tice, I ob|ject to the mode adopted in the next clau&s;e, for the profe&s;&s;ed purpo&s;e of rein&s;tating certain Rajahs, Ze|mindars, Polygars, and other landholders, who
<PB N="19" REF="20">
have been di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their lands. The claims of the parties are to be referred to the re&s;pective Pre&s;idencies, who are <HI>to inquire into, and determine upon them:</HI> that is, if inju&s;tice has been done, the per&s;ons, who have done it, are to repair it at their di&s;cretion. Is there any colour of propriety, is there any prudence in &s;uch a delegation of power? or do you think it would be effectual? For exam|ple, do you believe that any orders from the Court of Directors, or even from the highe&s;t power in this country, could engage Mr. Ha&s;tings to li&s;ten to the claims of the Rajah of Benares? Can he be rea&s;onably deemed an impartial judge of &s;uch claims? He has told the Directors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">20th March, 1783.</NOTE>, that <Q REND="inline">"if they &s;hould proceed to order the re&s;toration of Rajah Cheyt Sing, <HI>and, if the Council &s;hould re|&s;olve to execute the order,</HI> he would in&s;tantly give up his &s;tation and the &s;ervice."</Q> He &s;uppo&s;es it will be a que&s;tion in the Council, whether the order of the Directors &s;hall be executed or not; and he fairly appri&s;es them of his own re&s;olution to oppo&s;e it. For my own part, I am per&s;uaded that he would hazard his life rather than &s;ubmit to carry the order into execution him&s;elf. Yet, if ever there was a ca&s;e that called upon the national honour and huma|nity for ju&s;tice and protection, a&s;&s;uredly it is that of the Rajah of Benares.</P>
<P>The next clau&s;e is material indeed. The well-being, if not the exi&s;tence of the natives of all
<PB N="20" REF="21">
your Ea&s;tern Dominions, depends on a firm e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of that principle of taxation, which appears to be the object of the clau&s;e. Ever &s;ince I have known any thing of the &s;ubject, or had an oppor|tunity of offering an opinion about it, it has been the labour and effort of my life to inculcate and e&s;tabli&s;h the truth of this propo&s;ition&mdash;<HI>that the tri|bute, rent, &s;ervice, or payment to be paid by the &s;everal landholders, of whatever denomination, &s;hould be fixed and unalterable.</HI> The profe&s;&s;ed object of this clau&s;e is the real object, and re&s;ult of every conclu&s;ion, that my under&s;tanding is capable of deducing from ex|perience and reflection. The means, taken to accom|pli&s;h it, are the very wor&s;t that could be thought of. After twenty years po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Dewanny, after twenty years collection of the revenues, the fixation of the rents is &s;till to be a que&s;tion for future inve&s;|tigation.&mdash;Good God! Sir, are the&s;e inqui&s;itions into the property of our Indian &s;ubjects&mdash;are the&s;e &s;crutinies into the value of their e&s;tates <HI>never</HI> to have an end! Are the natives of India <HI>never</HI> to have a quietus under an Engli&s;h Government!&mdash;In the year 1784 you order the Governments abroad to <HI>de|vi&s;e &s;uch methods as &s;hall to them &s;eem mo&s;t fitting and convenient to e&s;tabli&s;h a fixed and unalterable tribute!</HI> The language held by the Directors, &s;even years ago, on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion, is wi&s;er and more hu|mane than yours, and ought to be a le&s;&s;on to you. In July, 1777, &s;peaking of a new mode of inqui&s;i|tion propo&s;ed and e&s;tabli&s;hed by Mr. Ha&s;tings, they &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"In the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the bu&s;ine&s;s, our &s;ur|pri&s;e

<P>But the pre&s;ent cour&s;e, it &s;eems, is taken, <HI>in or|der to prevent any corrupt or oppre&s;&s;ive practices.</HI>&mdash;Sir, the Court of Directors are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an|nual accounts of the revenues of Bengal &s;ince the year 1766. They have an account before them of the demand, receipt, and balance of every re&s;pec|tive year. In &s;hort, Sir, they po&s;&s;e&s;s every po&s;&s;ible light and information on the &s;ubject, which the Government of Bengal ought to look for, or would be able to obtain. They may take the collections of any one year for a &s;tandard, or, what is much better, they may take an average of the collections of &s;everal years, and determine at once, and for ever, what all the principal di&s;tricts &s;hall invariably pay. Perhaps it may be nece&s;&s;ary, though I do not think it will, to leave &s;ome parts of the minuter di&s;tribution to the power upon the &s;pot. The le&s;s you leave to it the better. The only danger of the mode I propo&s;e, or of any mode of fixation that can be propo&s;ed, is this&mdash;that, take what period or what average you will, con&s;idering the daily and rapid decline of the country, the amount of reve|nue, &s;o taken, will prove too much. The &s;tate of the country, and of the people, calls as loudly for
<PB N="22" REF="23">
abatement, as the nece&s;&s;ities of the Company call for increa&s;e of revenue.</P>
<P>This, Sir, is the true way <HI>to prevent corrupt or oppre&s;&s;ive practices.</HI> If you refer it to the &s;ervants abroad <HI>to devi&s;e the methods,</HI> and then to tran&s;mit their proceedings and determination to the Court of Directors for <HI>their</HI> final orders and directions:&mdash;in the fir&s;t place, the delay of it&s;elf is a new, or, ra|ther, a continued act of oppre&s;&s;ion to the natives; but what is much wor&s;e, your mea&s;ures are oppo&s;ed to your experience:&mdash;you unnece&s;&s;arily give powers, which you know, or ought to know, have been con|&s;tantly abu&s;ed. One example, if there were no other, ought to deter you from replacing a &s;imilar tru&s;t in &s;imilar hands. I have a right to a&s;&s;ert, though not from my own knowledge, that the five-years &s;ettlement of the revenues of Bengal, made in the year 1772, <HI>was &s;old</HI> by the Committee of Circuit. The fact is notorious in India; but it is on the authority of the Court of Directors that I affirm it to be true. In their letter of the 4th of March, 1778, they ordered the Governor General and Council <HI>forthwith to commence a pro&s;ecution in the Supreme Court of Judicature again&s;t the per&s;ons who compo&s;ed the Committee of Circuit, or their repre|&s;entatives</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This letter is &s;igned by the pre&s;ent Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Court of Directors, <HI>Mr. Smith and Mr. Devaynes.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>I do not doubt that the &s;ub&s;equent clau&s;e, for &s;e|curing the pen&s;ions allotted to &s;ome of the Zemin|dars
<PB N="23" REF="24">
in lieu of their lands, was drawn up with a be|nevolent intention; but I believe the fact it refers to is mi&s;under&s;tood. The fir&s;t and leading effort of national ju&s;tice &s;hould be to rein&s;tate the proprie|tors, of every denomination, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their property. The very mea&s;ure, that forced the&s;e pen&s;ions on the Zemindars, was an act of the mo&s;t de&s;potic oppre&s;&s;ion. The rents demanded of them, for this very purpo&s;e, were &s;o high, that, rather than be an&s;werable for &s;ums which they knew their lands could not afford, they accepted of pen&s;ions, and &s;urrendered the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and management of their e&s;tates to &s;trangers, to farmers, to adventurers, to the banyans of the Pre&s;ident and Council of Fort William. Is it otherwi&s;e to be believed, that any man in his &s;en&s;es would give up his landed e&s;tate for a pen&s;ion, to be held at the plea&s;ure of an arbitrary Government?&mdash;Do ju&s;tice to the&s;e people, and there will be no foundation for this clau&s;e.</P>
<P>It is proper and nece&s;&s;ary that the Court of Di|rectors &s;hould be re&s;trained from &s;ending any new &s;ervant, civil or military, to India, until the e&s;ta|bli&s;hments are fixed; and, when they are fixed, it is equally proper that the Directors &s;hould be re|&s;trained from &s;ending out writers, cadets, or others, beyond the number nece&s;&s;ary to fill up vacancies as they happen. The &s;ervice is overloaded with u&s;e|le&s;s &s;ervants: they are a burthen to the Government, and they con&s;titute a tax of the wor&s;t &s;ort upon the country.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="25">
There &s;eems to be no occa&s;ion for a law to con|firm an exi&s;ting rule of the Company's &s;ervioe. It is, and always has been, e&s;tabli&s;hed, that promo|tions &s;hould be made according to &s;eniority. The latitude given in the exception is perfectly unnece&s;|&s;ary, as well as incorrectly worded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The terms of the exception are, <Q REND="inline">"unle&s;s any of the &s;aid Go|vernments and Pre&s;idencies &s;hall, on any very urgent occa&s;ion, by a vote in Council, &s;ee cau&s;e to deviate from the &s;aid general rule."</Q></NOTE>. The Go|vernments abroad are ready enough to find <HI>urgent occa&s;ion to deviate from the general rule.</HI> The vote in Council is the very act of deviation, not the me|dium through which they &s;ee cau&s;e for it.</P>
<P>The next clau&s;e may properly be combined with another, which &s;tands at a di&s;tance from it; I mean to con&s;ider the &s;ixty-&s;eventh and eighty-ninth clau&s;es together. By the former no per&s;on, beyond a cer|tain age, is to be &s;ent to India as a cadet or writer; but no rea&s;on for the limitation is a&s;&s;igned. By the latter, no per&s;on what&s;oever, who &s;hall have been employed, <HI>in any capacity what&s;oever,</HI> in the Ea&s;t Indies, &s;hall be capable of being appointed to any &s;tation or office in India, after he, having returned to this kingdom, &s;hall have re&s;ided at home a cer|tain time, unle&s;s it be proved that &s;uch re&s;idence was nece&s;&s;ary for his health: &s;o that the wor&s;t man in the &s;ervice is capable of being rein&s;tated, provi|ded he re&s;igned it on account of his health; whereas an able and meritorious &s;ervant, who may have been obliged to come to England, and to re&s;ide here longer than the limited period, for the mo&s;t urgent
<PB N="25" REF="26">
and ju&s;tifiable rea&s;ons, though not for ill health, is utterly prohibited from returning to a &s;ervice, to which he may have devoted his life, and for which he may have relinqui&s;hed all other pro&s;pects and pur&s;uits. I &s;ee no rea&s;on for the di&s;tinction. There is no po&s;itive merit in &s;ickne&s;s, though it has a na|tural claim to indulgence. One would think that the executive power of the Company, if the Court of Directors are equal to any of their duties, might &s;afely be tru&s;ted with &s;uch details as the&s;e. It is not an object that apparently requires the interpo&s;ition of the Legi&s;lature: but if it did, the proper and u&s;eful regulation would be, not ab|&s;olutely to prohibit ab&s;entees from returning to the &s;ervice, but to prevent their gaining rank in their ab&s;ence over tho&s;e, who continued to do their duty on the &s;pot. Whoever &s;tayed in England, beyond the limit of a rea&s;onable leave of ab&s;ence, &s;hould return preci&s;ely to the rank he held when he left India.</P>
<P>Taking the operation of the two clau&s;es together, the re&s;ult &s;eems to be, that, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, no man, who &s;hall have acquired knowledge or expe|rience in England, &s;hall be permitted to go India; and that no man, who may have acquired know|ledge and experience in India, &s;hall be permitted to return, unle&s;s his faculties have been &s;ufficiently impaired by his infirmities, to qualify him for re|&s;uming the duties of his &s;tation. The favourite idea &s;eems to be, that youth and inexperience &s;hould govern Bengal. An old maxim of policy attaches
<PB N="26" REF="27">
experience to years, and wi&s;dom to experience; and though I know there is a brilliant exception to this maxim, I wi&s;h it to be left where it &s;tands&mdash;a bril|liant exception to a general principle, and not, that the exception &s;hould be converted into a rule.</P>
<P>Nothing can be objected to the principle and purpo&s;e of that clau&s;e, which makes all offences committed by Briti&s;h &s;ubjects in every other part of India, <HI>or under pretence of the order of any native protected Prince,</HI> amenable to the &s;ame laws, and liable to the &s;ame penalties, <HI>as if they had been com|mitted within the territories directly &s;ubject to the Bri|ti&s;h Government.</HI> At the &s;ame time, there will be a legal difficulty in the proceeding, which gentlemen of the profe&s;&s;ion would do well to con&s;ider. The proce&s;s of our courts of ju&s;tice does not run beyond the limits of our own provinces; &s;o that, although the party accu&s;ed may be in your power, the wit|ne&s;&s;es nece&s;&s;ary to convict or acquit him cannot, in any regular cour&s;e of proceeding, be compelled to appear. If this difficulty be not provided for, there can be no trial of the offences in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>On the &s;ubject of pre&s;ents, my opinion, perhaps, may be thought particular. Forms and appearances, I know, are again&s;t it. Undoubtedly the Governor General and Council, the Judges, and any others who have great e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;alaries, &s;hould derive no other advantage from their &s;tation. With re&s;pect to <HI>them,</HI> the prohibition of pre&s;ents is proper; but it ought to be complete. I can a&s;&s;ure the Hou&s;e, that the exception in favour of pre&s;ents of cere|mony
<PB N="27" REF="28">
<HI>on &s;olemn occa&s;ions,</HI> is founded on ideas which I know to be fallacious. The acceptance of ceremo|nial pre&s;ents is no way nece&s;&s;ary for &s;upporting the dignity of men in power, nor has the refu&s;al of them ever given offence. General Clavering, Colonel Mon&s;on, and I, con&s;tantly refu&s;ed them. We told the natives, it was again&s;t the law of England, the very law by which we were appointed, and they were &s;atisfied. Mr. Ha&s;tings declared, that he &s;hould continue to receive <HI>nuzzers,</HI> and carry them to the Company's account. Our other honourable colleague, who is now a Member of the Hou&s;e, <HI>en|tirely approved of the honourable Pre&s;ident's conduct in the receipt of complimentary nuzzers:</HI> but he did not equally approve of accounting for them to the Com|pany. His words are; <Q REND="inline">"I might here make a ten|der to the Public of the trivial <HI>nuzzers,</HI> to the acceptance of which my &s;tation has impelled me. But what is proper for the Governor General, would in <HI>me,</HI> I apprehend, appear rather in the light of a con&s;equential, in&s;ignificant di&s;play of rigidne&s;s in exce&s;s!"</Q> In Mr. Ha&s;tings's letters you have &s;een &s;ome &s;plendid examples of the &s;ub|lime. The honourable gentleman, who&s;e words I have ju&s;t repeated, &s;ucceeds better in the profound. It is his forte. The&s;e trivial pre&s;ents accumulate very fa&s;t. If I had laid my&s;elf out for the receipt of them, I have no doubt, that whlie I was in Bengal I might have reali&s;ed eight or nine thou&s;and pounds from this petty &s;ource of profit. To men in high &s;tation, the prohibition &s;hould be ab&s;olute.
<PB N="28" REF="29">
In all &s;tations, it &s;hould be highly penal to receive money for corrupt purpo&s;es, or to extort it. In the ordinary tran&s;action of bu&s;ine&s;s, I am inclined to think that pre&s;ents are not dangerous, and I know that they are u&s;eful. The Government of Bengal, through all its gradations, is a Government of favour, not of ju&s;tice. Nothing would ever be done for the natives, if they did not gratify the per&s;ons who forwarded their affairs. Whenever there &s;hall be a Government of &s;trict ju&s;tice in Bengal, and when|ever provi&s;ion &s;hall be made for the various offices under it, proportioned to their re&s;pective rank and power, you may totally aboli&s;h pre&s;ents. Till then, you neither can, nor ought to do it&mdash;till then, the oaths you pre&s;cribe to the collectors of the revenue will bind none but men of honour. Men of a dif|ferent character will either totally di&s;regard the pro|hibition, or &s;atisfy their &s;cruples, if they have any, by accommodating the exception to all ca&s;es, or all ca&s;es to the exception. For the purpo&s;e of re|ceiving <HI>pre&s;ents of ceremony,</HI> all occa&s;ions will be found &s;ufficiently <HI>&s;olemn.</HI></P>
<P>By the &s;ixty-ninth clau&s;e, the whole gift or pre|&s;ent is to be forfeited to the King: by the &s;even|tieth, the court of ju&s;tice may order the gift to be re&s;tored to the party who gave it. Can the &s;ame pre&s;ent, &s;uppo&s;ing it were a diamond, be forfeited to the Crown and re&s;tored to the owner; or is it meant that the offender &s;hall forfeit double the value in every in&s;tance?&mdash;The two clau&s;es &s;eem to me to contradict one another.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="30">
The &s;eventy-fir&s;t makes an exception in favour of coun&s;ellors at law, phy&s;icians, &s;urgeons, or chap|lains; but it takes no notice of attornies, who are much more in the receipt of fees than any of the others.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to <HI>the wilful di&s;obeying, or the wil|fully omitting to execute the Company's orders,</HI> if there be no material in&s;tances of the di&s;obedience alluded to, the law that propo&s;es to puni&s;h it hereafter is &s;u|perfluous and unju&s;t. The Legi&s;lature interpo&s;es be|fore it is called upon:&mdash;it &s;uppo&s;es offences, which are not &s;tated, and, by &s;uppo&s;ing them to exi&s;t ge|nerally, it confounds the innocent with the guilty. If they <HI>do</HI> exi&s;t, to a degree, that warrants and de|mands the interpo&s;ition of the Legi&s;lature, they ought to be puni&s;hed as well as forbidden; at lea&s;t the offenders ought to be removed from their places.

them to England. No fact is &s;tated, or even allu|ded to, that might require the delegation of &s;o dan|gerous a tru&s;t. I declare, that while I was in India, there never was an in&s;tance fit to be named as the foundation of &s;uch a law as this; nor have I heard of any &s;ince. Corre&s;pondence with the enemies of the State is high trea&s;on; and trea&s;on may be pu|ni&s;hed without a new law. But what do you mean by <HI>illicit commerce?</HI> What tran&s;action is there in life which an arbitrary Government may not inter|pret into <HI>an illicit commerce?</HI> Do you mean to deny the parties the benefit of the <HI>Habeas Corpus?</HI> Do you mean to leave it to the di&s;cretion of the Go|vernor and Council at what time the party &s;hall be tried, or to <HI>their</HI> option whether he &s;hall be tried on the &s;pot, or &s;ent a pri&s;oner to England? No, Sir; I know perfectly well what is meant. The liberty of every individual in India is to be held at the mercy of the Governor General. The clau&s;e has no real object, but to increa&s;e his per&s;onal power, and to make it irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>I have now gone through the &s;econd divi&s;ion of the bill. Before I proceed to the third, I have an appeal to make to the honour and to the ju&s;tice of the Hou&s;e. It is of a nature &s;o per&s;onal, that it will probaby excite their curio&s;ity; but it is al&s;o connected with the public &s;ervice. It has a natu|ral and a nece&s;&s;ary relation to the general object of the pre&s;ent bill, and therefore de&s;erves their atten|tion. It concerns the &s;ervice of the public in fu|ture, that the character of men, who have faith|fully
<PB N="31" REF="32">
and honourably di&s;charged the duties of a high &s;tation, &s;hould be protected from reproach. The in&s;ults, offered to the memory of &s;uch men, contribute to deter others from following their ex|ample, are injurious to the community, and ought to be re&s;ented with univer&s;al indignation. It is not of my&s;elf I &s;peak;&mdash;that &s;pirit of pre&s;umption does not belong to me. I am proud of the fortune, that connected my name and united my labours with tho&s;e of Clavering and Mon&s;on, and it is all the di&s;tinction I pretend to.</P>
<P>When I &s;ought to obtain a &s;eat in the Hou&s;e of Commons, it was not merely for the honour of &s;it|ting here, nor for any delight I take in your de|bates. With re&s;pect to India affairs, my fir&s;t view was, not to &s;erve England or the India Company; but the natives of India if I could. To them I am bound by every obligation of ju&s;tice, gratitude, and compa&s;&s;ion. From <HI>them</HI> I received the &s;alary, which gave me a fortune. But, even if the &s;ervice of Eng|land had been my only object, this is the cour&s;e I &s;hould have taken to pur&s;ue it. I will not appeal to your virtues, or &s;uppo&s;e that you have any. If you have common &s;en&s;e, if, as intere&s;ted men, you under&s;tand your own intere&s;t, you will treat the creatures, &s;ubject to your power, with lenity and ju&s;tice. If wealth be your object, you will protect the indu&s;try, you will nur&s;e and cheri&s;h the e&s;tate, by which you expect to be enriched.</P>
<P>My &s;econd rea&s;on for obtaining a &s;eat in Parlia|ment was to have an opportunity of explaining my
<PB N="32" REF="33">
own conduct, if it &s;hould be que&s;tioned, or de|fending it, if it &s;hould be attacked. The la&s;t, and not the lea&s;t urgent rea&s;on was, that I might be ready to defend the character of my colleagues, not again&s;t &s;pecific charges, which I am &s;ure will never be produced; but again&s;t the language of calumny, which endeavours to a&s;per&s;e, without daring to accu&s;e. It is well known that a gro&s;s and public in&s;ult has been offered to the memory of General Clavering and Colonel Mon&s;on, by a per|&s;on of high rank in this country. I was happy when I heard, that <HI>my</HI> name was included in it with theirs. So highly do I re&s;pect the character of tho&s;e men, that I deem it an honour to &s;hare in the inju&s;tice it has &s;uffered.&mdash;It is in compliance with the forms of the Hou&s;e, and not to &s;helter my&s;elf, or out of tenderne&s;s to the party, that I forbear to name him. I mean to de&s;cribe him &s;o exactly, that he cannot be mi&s;taken. He declared in his place in a great a&s;&s;embly, and in the cour&s;e of a grave deliberation, <Q REND="inline">"that it would have been happy for this country, if General Clavering, Colonel Mon&s;on, and Mr. Francis, had been drowned in their pa&s;&s;age to India."</Q>&mdash;If this poor and &s;piteful invective had been uttered by a man of no con&s;equence or repute, by any light, trifling, incon&s;iderate per&s;on, by a Lord of the Bedchamber for example, or any of the other &s;ilken Barons of modern days, I &s;hould have heard it with indifference. But when it is &s;eriou&s;ly urged and deli|berately in&s;i&s;ted on by a grave Lord of Parliament&mdash;
<PB N="33" REF="34">
by a Judge,&mdash;by a man of ability and eminence in his profe&s;&s;ion, who&s;e per&s;onal di&s;po&s;ition is &s;erious, who carries gravity to &s;terne&s;s, and &s;terne&s;s to fe|rocity, it cannot be received with indifference, or an&s;wered without re&s;entment. Such a man will be thought to have inquired before he pronounced. From <HI>his</HI> mouth, a reproach is a &s;entence, an invec|tive is a judgement.&mdash;The accidents of life, and not any original di&s;tinction that I know of, have placed <HI>him</HI> too high, and <HI>me</HI> at too great a di&s;tance from him, to admit of any other an&s;wer from me, than a public defiance, for General Clavering, for Colonel Mon&s;on, and for my&s;elf. This is not a party que&s;tion, nor &s;hould it be left to &s;o feeble an advocate as I am to &s;upport it.&mdash;The friends and fellow &s;oldiers of General Clavering and Colonel Mon&s;on will a&s;&s;i&s;t me in defending their memory. I demand and expect the &s;upport of every man of honour in this Hou&s;e, and in the kingdom. What character is &s;afe, if &s;lander be permitted to attack the reputation of two of the mo&s;t honourable and virtuous men that ever were employed, or ever pe|ri&s;hed in the &s;ervice of their country?&mdash;I know that the authority of this man is not without weight; but I have an infinitely higher authority to oppo&s;e to it. I had the happine&s;s of hearing the merits of General Clavering and Colonel Mon&s;on acknowledged and applauded in terms, to which I am not at liberty to do more than to allude. They were rapid and expre&s;&s;ive. I mu&s;t not venture to repeat lea&s;t I &s;hould do them inju&s;tice, or violate
<PB N="34" REF="35">
the forms of re&s;pect, where e&s;&s;entially I owe and feel the mo&s;t. But I am &s;ufficiently under&s;tood. The generous &s;en&s;ations, that animate the Royal mind, are ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e, which rankle in the heart of that per&s;on, who is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the keeper of the Royal con&s;cience.</P>
<P>The third divi&s;ion of the bill includes the in&s;ti|tution of a new judicature, avowedly repugnant to all the principles of the criminal juri&s;prudence of this country, and of which there is no example, but the Star Chamber, in the hi&s;tory of England. My &s;urpri&s;e and di&s;appointment, when I heard this part of the bill recommended and in&s;i&s;ted on by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, are not to be expre&s;|&s;ed. Yet I might have been in &s;ome degree pre|pared for the event. This is not the fir&s;t in&s;tance, in which I have ob&s;erved that the right honourable gentleman is never more urgent, is never more elo|quent in e&s;tabli&s;hing the truth of a general propo|&s;ition, or in exaiting the virtues of a general princi|ple, than at the moment he is going to introduce an exception to it.&mdash;No man, who heard him, can have forgotten, how earne&s;tly and how vehemently he recommended it to the Hou&s;e, not to let their anxiety for the better government of India, how|ever laudable, engage them to do any thing incon|&s;i&s;tent with the &s;ecurity of our own dome&s;tic e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, or that might directly or indirectly in|trench on our own con&s;titution. From this general caution, he proceeded to a warm and animated pa|negyric of the trial by jury. I declare mo&s;t &s;o|lemnly
<PB N="35" REF="36">
that I thought he was going to new model the Supreme Court of Judicature at Calcutta, and to re&s;tore the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects in India to their birth|right, of which they were deprived by the charter of that Court, for no good purpo&s;e that I can di&s;|cover, but certainly without any good effect. When the right honourable gentleman had thus e&s;tabli&s;h|ed his premi&s;es, by an appeal to con&s;titutional to|pics, which always gain upon an Engli&s;h audience, he turned &s;hort to a conclu&s;ion, which I imagine mu&s;t have di&s;appointed and a&s;toni&s;hed every man, who was not immediately in the &s;ecret&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"That the be&s;t general rules were &s;ubject to exceptions, that nece&s;&s;ity created a law of its own, and that &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ity exi&s;ted at pre&s;ent. That the puni&s;h|ment of Indian delinquents could not be obtain|ed by proceedings in Parliament, nor by pro&s;e|cution in the courts of common law,&mdash;of cour&s;e that there was no alternative, but to create a &s;pe|cial judicature, with &s;ummary proceedings, <HI>and without the intervention of a Jury,</HI> for the trial of offences committed in India."</Q>&mdash;In the fir&s;t place, Sir, I deny the &s;uppo&s;ition, on which the inference is founded. I have no doubt that delinquency of every kind may be effectually tried and puni&s;hed by the judicatures that exi&s;t. But if I thought other|wi&s;e,&mdash;if I were perfectly convinced that Indian delinquents could no way be puni&s;hed but by a vio|lent innovation in the criminal law of the kingdom, I would not purcha&s;e their puni&s;hment at &s;o ruinous an expence. I would not, for the &s;ake of that ob|ject,
<PB N="36" REF="37">
though I think it important, con&s;ent to a breach of any kind in the principal barrier of the freedom of England. When the precedent is e&s;tabli&s;hed, I know not what farther innovations may be gradually grafted upon it, or how rapidly it may advance to the de&s;truction of tho&s;e principles, which it begins with invading. We are not yet however reduced to that con&s;ideration. Let us try whether, in effect, the right honourable gentleman is warranted in af|firming that there is no alternative. If there be, the principles we both profe&s;s oblige him to prefer it.&mdash;I am but little of a lawyer, and I am very de|&s;irous to be in&s;tructed. If I &s;hould be mi&s;taken in my facts, &s;ome of the learned gentlemen oppo&s;ite to me will have the goodne&s;s to correct me.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing it to be admitted, that taking the law as it now &s;tands, the formality of pleading, and the difficulty of a&s;certaining, according to the &s;trict rules of evidence, facts which have ari&s;en beyond &s;ea, are &s;uch as will create a failure of ju&s;tice, it does not follow, that it is at all nece&s;&s;ary to deprive per&s;ons accu&s;ed of offences in India of trial by Jury. The Court of King's Bench has already the power of trying mi&s;demeanors committed in India, under the 13th of Geo. III. cap. 63. <HI>with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Jury.</HI> If the forms of pleading and the rules of evidence &s;tand in the way of ju&s;tice, let the law be altered:&mdash;with re&s;pect to &s;pecial pleading and evi|dence, let the King's Bench be governed by the &s;ame rules that are laid down to govern the prac|tice of this new Court; and then it will be as com|petent
<PB N="37" REF="38">
as this can be, to take cognizance of, and puni&s;h offences committed in India, and &s;till the par|ty accu&s;ed will, in every in&s;tance, have the privi|lege of being tried by his peers. When the act of 1774 was made, it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to alter the law with regard to evidence: and it was accord|ingly enacted, that depo&s;itions, taken under a com|mi&s;&s;ion in India, &s;hould be admitted as evidence in the King's Bench; but trial by jury &s;till remained. The Legi&s;lature did nothing to affect that mode of trial. Before that act, a mi&s;demeanor committed in India could not have been tried upon an informa|tion in the King's Bench, &s;o that here was a new juri&s;diction given to that Court; its juri&s;diction was at lea&s;t extended to offences in India, which were before not cognizable in that Court, either by information or indictment. At common law, trea|fons committed out of the realm were not puni&s;h|able in England. To remedy this defect, various acts were made in the reign of Henry VIII.: but even in the arbitrary reign of that Monarch, no at|tempt was made to deprive the &s;ubject of trial by jury. At common law, murders committed in fo|reign parts could not be inquired into in England; but by the 33d Henry VIII. cap. 23. they might be inquired of, and tried by the King's <HI>&s;pecial commi&s;|&s;ion</HI> in England. By that act a <HI>new tribunal</HI> was erected; but &s;till no attempt was made to aboli&s;h trial by jury. Even in that <HI>commi&s;&s;ion</HI> court, the party had the privilege of being tried by his peers. If it be true, that a new &s;pecies of criminality makes
<PB N="38" REF="39">
a new cour&s;e of proceeding unavoidable, the ground of the di&s;tinction mu&s;t be fairly and clearly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed. The an&s;wer I expect mu&s;t not be techni|cal, but plain enough to &s;atisfy the under&s;tanding of men, who are not learned. When the common intere&s;t is at &s;take, the common &s;en&s;e of the nation &s;hould be con&s;ulted.</P>
<P>A word or two more on the general &s;ituation of the country, and I have done. We have it from the authority of a noble Lord<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Delaval.</NOTE>, or rather of a no|ble convert, who&s;e opinions very properly bend to his experience, that, at a former period, he had oppo&s;ed the pre&s;ent Admini&s;tration, becau&s;e he di&s;|approved of the cour&s;es, by which they had po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of power;&mdash;that the ca&s;e was <HI>now</HI> completely altered; that the &s;en&s;e of the nation had been unanimou&s;ly declared, and that the united voice of the nation could not be re&s;i&s;ted;&mdash;that the Mini&s;ter had <HI>now</HI> come into power, <HI>at the front door of the Hou&s;e, and on the &s;houlders of the People.</HI> I do not mean to di&s;pute the truth of the&s;e propo&s;itions, much le&s;s the propriety of any change of opinion, that may be founded upon them. Take the fact as it is &s;tated, and compare it with the con&s;equences, which it has immediately produced. Wherever &s;en&s;ation exi&s;ts, the compari&s;on will be felt; and, if men are &s;till capable of reflection, it will force them to reflect. The very fir&s;t act of this popular Ad|mini&s;tration, of a Mini&s;ter, who comes into power <HI>on the &s;houlders of the People,</HI> attacks the Democracy
<PB N="39" REF="40">
of the country, and annihilates the fir&s;t of all the popular powers of the Con&s;titution. The deci&s;ion of the que&s;tion upon the We&s;tmin&s;ter election, how|ever it may be turned, or in whatever colours it may be dre&s;&s;ed, carries you finally and inevitably to this conclu&s;ion; that the People of Great Britain <HI>may</HI> be governed by laws, to which they have not con|&s;ented, and <HI>may</HI> be taxed by a Hou&s;e of Commons, in which they are not repre&s;ented. If this be the fact of We&s;tmin&s;ter to-day, why not of London to|morrow,&mdash;of Middle&s;ex the next? On the face of the precedent, I &s;ee nothing to confine it.</P>
<P>The &s;econd mea&s;ure of this popular Admini&s;tra|tion attacks the trial by jury, and threatens to abo|li&s;h it. Such are the in&s;tant operations of that very power, which pretends to be derived from the confi|dence of the People.&mdash;But if the People of Eng|land are not mad as well as blind, if they have not lo&s;t their under&s;tanding as well as their feelings, they will &s;oon &s;ee how unwi&s;ely they have be&s;towed their confidence, and repent of their delu&s;ion, when re|pentance is too late.</P>

<OPENER>"THE order of the day being read, for taking into further confideration the Report from the Committee of the whole Hou&s;e, to whom the Bill for the better regulation and management of the affairs of the Ea&s;t-India Company, and of the Briti&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in India, and for e&s;tabli&s;hing a Court of Judicature for the more &s;peedy and effectual trial of per&s;ons accu&s;ed of offences in the Ea&s;t Indies, was committed."</OPENER>
<HEAD>Mr. FRANCIS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. SPEAKER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>My objections to the bill, as it now &s;tands, are in &s;ome re&s;pects changed; but they are very little di|mini&s;hed. It is not to be denied, that the bill has been materially altered, and, in &s;ome in&s;tances, im|proved in the Committee. In&s;tead of profe&s;&s;ing candour, which too often is affectation, I &s;hall
<PB N="41" REF="42">
&s;peak of the pre&s;ent merits of the bill, with &s;in|cerity. I allow that &s;everal clau&s;es have been prudently corrected, and others very properly omitted; but I do not mean to admit, that parti|cular improvements, grafted on fal&s;e principles, can e&s;&s;entially mend the mea&s;ure. It is po&s;&s;ible that a thing, which is wrong in one extreme, may be equally wrong in another. In acknowledging the improvements that have been made, I hope at lea&s;t to e&s;tabli&s;h a claim to credit, when I return to my objections.</P>
<P>No orders are now to be &s;ent to India by the Commi&s;&s;ioners without the knowledge of the Di|rectors, or to the Commanders in Chief in India, without the knowledge of the re&s;pective Pre&s;iden|cies. Orders of every kind are now to be conveyed through the proper con&s;titutional channels. While you &s;uffer the Court of Directors to exi&s;t, their au|thority belongs to the con&s;titution of the Company. To pa&s;s by the fir&s;t is to de&s;troy the &s;econd. The ab&s;urdity of that idea is acknowledged and corrected. The clau&s;es, by which the appointment of the &s;eve|ral Commanders in Chief, and of per&s;ons to &s;ucceed to the command in ca&s;e of vacancy, was to be given to His Maje&s;ty, are omitted. Undoubtedly, nothing could be more extravagant than the idea of &s;eparating the military from the civil power of the Company's Government. The alteration was indi&s;pen&s;ably ne|ce&s;&s;ary. At the &s;ame time, I have no conception how it can po&s;&s;ibly be reconciled to a political principle, which a right honourable gentleman, in opening the
<PB N="42" REF="43">
original plan of the bill, laid down as fundamental. He urged and in&s;i&s;ted on the truth of this propo&s;i|tion, and a&s;&s;erted it to be inherent in the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, that the armies of any one State, how|ever they might be divided, or wherever they might be employed, belonged to the department of the executive power, and that therefore the appointment to the &s;everal commands of the Company's forces &s;hould unque&s;tionably be ve&s;ted in the Crown. He had then forgotten, what he po&s;&s;ibly may &s;ince have recollected, that the Court of Directors are in fact the executive power of the State in que&s;tion. But I need not combat a propo&s;ition, which he him&s;elf has &s;o completely abandoned. The right honoura|ble gentleman, I &s;ee, is not ob&s;tinately tenacious of his principles, or his complai&s;ance to his friends mu&s;t be unbounded.</P>
<P>The &s;everal clau&s;es in the original bill, which re|late to the private debts of the Nabob of Arcot and the Rajah of Tanjore;&mdash;the re&s;pective claims or undetermined rights and preten&s;ions of tho&s;e princes;&mdash;the rein&s;tatement of di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Rajahs, Zemindars, and other landholders;&mdash;the fixation of the rents or tributes to be paid in future;&mdash;the re|duction of expences, and the final limitation of e&s;ta|bli&s;hments, offices, and emoluments;&mdash;are all com|pletely relinqui&s;hed,&mdash;I will not pre&s;ume to &s;ay, in compliance with <HI>my</HI> opinion, but a good deal in conformity to it.&mdash;The principle I recommended &s;eems to be generally adopted, that whatever can be done, immediately by the Directors at home, &s;hould
<PB N="43" REF="44">
not be referred to the &s;ervants abroad. Yet I am &s;orry to &s;ee that, in this general &s;weep, the very be&s;t clau&s;e of the fir&s;t bill is included. I mean the one marked 58, by which it was provided <Q REND="inline">"that it &s;hould not be lawful for the Governor General and Council of Fort William, or the Governor and Council of any of the other Pre&s;idencies, or any &s;ervant or agent of the &s;aid United Com|pany, of what de&s;cription or denomination &s;oever, to alter &s;uch tribute, rent, &s;ervice, or payment as the &s;aid Court of Directors &s;hould have finally confirmed, upon any pretence what&s;oever, or to exact from or impo&s;e upon any native Prince, or his heirs, or per&s;ons claiming under them, any greater or different tribute, rent, &s;ervice, or pay|ment, than &s;uch as &s;hould have been confirmed by the Court of Directors."</Q></P>
<P>I mo&s;t earne&s;tly recommend it to the right ho|nourable gentleman to rein&s;tate this clau&s;e, or to revive the &s;pirit of it, in terms accommodated to the new principle which appears to be a&s;&s;umed. The tribute once fixed, I would not leave it in the power even of the Directors to alter it.</P>
<P>The clau&s;e, re&s;pecting pre&s;ents, is properly amended. Wherever the prohibition is right, it ought to &s;tand without exception. Admitting that pre&s;ents were really and purely ceremonial, in <HI>my</HI> mind they degrade the dignity of a high &s;tation in&s;tead of exalting it. What in fact, and even in appearance, can be more di&s;graceful, than for a Briti&s;h Governor to hold out his hand to receive a
<PB N="44" REF="45">
few gold mohrs or rupees from every native, who comes to vi&s;it him, and frequently from per&s;ons, who are unable to afford it. The true dignity of power is to be acce&s;&s;ible to its &s;ubjects, without ex|pecting them to pay for it. With re&s;pect to the &s;ubordinate ranks of the &s;ervice, I &s;till have my doubts. I am perfectly &s;atisfied, that in the pre|&s;ent &s;tate of the &s;ervice, no law can prevent the practice, and I am not &s;ure that you ought to at|tempt it. I have no expectation that &s;uch a direct provi&s;ion will ever be made for the Company's &s;er|vants, as will even afford them a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; much le&s;s an exceeding, out of which an independence can be gradually accumulated, by any efforts of oeconomy. People in England have no idea of the expence of living in Bengal. There is no &s;uch thing as commerce. The few, who have engaged in enterpri&s;es of internal indu&s;try, have either to|tally failed, or been obliged to abandon them:&mdash;and the falaries, given by the Company, below the Board of Trade and the Colonels of Brigades, are very inconfiderable. Yet no man &s;hould be cut off from the hopes of a rea&s;onable and moderate inde|pendence, in proportion to his &s;tation.&mdash;Human in&s;titutions &s;hould con&s;ult human nature.</P>
<P>I believe, Sir, I have now taken notice of every material amendment, that de&s;erves commendation. The other branches of the &s;ubject are more nume|rous and productive.</P>
<P>In comparing the pre&s;ent bill with the fir&s;t, there is one general preliminary ob&s;ervation to be made
<PB N="45" REF="46">
upon them both; that the two bills draw two con|clu&s;ions equally fal&s;e, though perfectly different, from one and the &s;ame fal&s;e principle of policy. The principle, common to them both, is, that, where power is really wanted, where power ought to be &s;trengthened, the &s;ure&s;t way to &s;trengthen it will be to divide it. On this foundation, the fir&s;t bill, in&s;tead of uniting the executive powers of the Company in any one Board, divided them between the Commi&s;&s;ioners and the Directors, with &s;o great a preponderance in favour of the former, that the latter in reality were reduced to nothing and ought to have been aboli&s;hed. On the &s;ame foundation, the pre&s;ent bill continues to divide a power, which ought to be united, but di&s;tributes it differently. The Crown and the Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;urrender almo&s;t eve|ry thing they had taken, and the Directors are re|inve&s;ted with a power, which evidently &s;uppo&s;es them fit to be highly tru&s;ted. But the tru&s;t, as it &s;tands, is incompatible with the control. The fir&s;t bill, placing no confidence in the Directors, dive&s;ted them of all power. The amended bill continues a check, in which the &s;ame want of confidence is implied, yet re&s;tores them to a power, which ought never to be given to men who are di&s;tru&s;ted.&mdash;With re&s;pect to the governments abroad, the means taken to accompli&s;h the profe&s;&s;ed object of both the bills are nearly the &s;ame. In order to make the power at home more capable of governing, they divide it. But, in order to make the power in In|dia more governable, they &s;trengthen and unite it.

This is the &s;en&s;e, in which the old maxim, <HI>divide et impera,</HI> is now under&s;tood. This is the way, in which ancient maxims of policy are interpreted and applied by modern politicians.</P>
<P>The amended bill reduces the Pre&s;idency of Fort William to a Governor General and three Coun|&s;ellors, for the immediate purpo&s;e, <HI>expre&s;sly avow|ed</HI> by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, of giving effect to the ca&s;ting voice, in order to increa&s;e and &s;trengthen the power of the Governor General. This, I believe, is the fir&s;t example of &s;uch a u&s;e and application of the effect of a ca&s;ting voice. In all deliberative councils and a&s;&s;emblies whatever, the true and natural principle of deci&s;ion is by a real majority of votes. But numbers, who debate, may di&s;agree; and, if the whole number happens to be even, they may po&s;&s;ibly divide into equal parts. In that ca&s;e only, the operation of the ca&s;ting voice is made u&s;e of to create a fictitious majority, not for the purpo&s;e of giving power, but merely to obtain a deci&s;ion.&mdash;Hitherto the ca&s;ting voice has been con&s;idered as a nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ion again&s;t a po&s;&s;ible inconvenience. The pre&s;ent bill creates the incon|venience, not merely for the purpo&s;e of correcting it, but to convey a power, which, if proper to be given at all, ought to be given by a direct cour&s;e, and &s;ecured again&s;t accidents. On the principle of the clau&s;es in que&s;tion, the Governor General ought to be a di&s;tinct per&s;on, and ve&s;ted with powers in|dependent of the Council.&mdash;As long as a Council of four is full, the whole power, that belongs to it,
<PB N="47" REF="48">
will certainly ve&s;t in the Pre&s;ident, provided he has &s;kill enough to &s;ecure the blind and devoted &s;upport of any one of the other three; and this, I know, may be done. But, &s;uppo&s;e his complai&s;ant friend &s;hould die or depart, and the other two &s;hould con|tinue ob&s;tinate;&mdash;the declared object of the bill is defeated.&mdash;The Pre&s;ident is reduced to a &s;tate, in which he can do nothing but perplex or embarra&s;s the others, and in that &s;tate he mu&s;t remain, until his intere&s;t and influence at home &s;hall have accom|pli&s;hed another appointment. A year and a half at lea&s;t mu&s;t elap&s;e, before his new colleague can come to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;If therefore the power be proper, the bill &s;hould take care to provide for its being held and exerci&s;ed without interruption.&mdash;Sir, I am not &s;uppo&s;ing imaginary ca&s;es. The oppo&s;ition to Mr. Ha&s;tings has not been con&s;ined to General Clavering, Colonel Mon&s;on, and my&s;elf. His pre&s;ent col|leagues, Mr. Wheler, Mr. Macpher&s;on, and Mr. Stables, have exactly the &s;ame opinion, that we had, of him and of his mea&s;ures. Their oppo&s;ition is as vigorous as <HI>they</HI> can make it, and, I believe, more deeply re&s;ented by Mr. Ha&s;tings, than ours.&mdash;From <HI>our</HI> oppo&s;ition, however it might di&s;tre&s;s him, he felt no degradation. Of his pre&s;ent colleagues I know he has written home to this effect, that he &s;hould have quitted the Government long ago, if he could have ventured to leave it in <HI>&s;uch</HI> hands as <HI>theirs!</HI></P>
<P>But perhaps it may be &s;u&s;pected that the Chan|cellor of the Exchequer, in &s;orming this arrange|ment,
<PB N="48" REF="49">
has been guided by experience, and that he has facts of importance to appeal to in &s;upport of it.&mdash;I will tell the Hou&s;e how the facts &s;tand, and leave it to their judgement to compare them with the arrangement. Some of the Directors are pre|&s;ent, and I call upon them to &s;upport me if I am right, or to contradict me if I am wrong.</P>
<P>Before the death of Colonel Mon&s;on, the Council con&s;i&s;ted of five per&s;ons. I do not mean at pre&s;ent to inquire into the re&s;pective merits of the two par|ties, into which it was divided, or to exalt one at the expence of the other. For the immediate purpo&s;e of the pre&s;ent argument, it is &s;ufficient for me to &s;ay, what every man in India and in the direction knows to be true, that, while the Government of Bengal was in the hands of five per&s;ons, the Com|pany's affairs were prudently conducted, and pro&s;|pered accordingly. The &s;y&s;tem, laid down in their general in&s;tructions, was ob&s;erved;&mdash;their orders were obeyed;&mdash;their debts were di&s;charged;&mdash;their trea&s;ury was filled;&mdash;and great inve&s;tments were provided by &s;avings out of the revenue. Above all the re&s;t, <HI>we fixed our attention to the pre&s;ervation of peace throughout India.</HI> We maintained it our|&s;elves, and, when it was violated by the Pre&s;idency of Bombay, we re&s;tored it by a direct interpo&s;ition of the authority of our Government. When the death of Colonel Mon&s;on had reduced the Council to four, which it &s;eems is now the favourite number, the mi&s;chiefs, which have &s;ince de&s;olated India and ruined the India Company, began to operate. The
<PB N="49" REF="50">
&s;econd war with the Marattas was planned at Bombay the moment they heard of the death of General Clavering, and received, embraced, and promoted by the Governor General and Council, the moment the plan was communicated to us. In le&s;s than five months after the death of General Clavering, the re&s;olution was taken at Fort William to break the definitive treaty of peace concluded but a year be|fore at <HI>Poorundur,</HI> and to &s;end an army acro&s;s India to invade the <HI>Pe&s;hwa</HI>'s dominions. The General's place was &s;oon &s;upplied by Mr. Wheler, &s;o that, from Colonel Mon&s;on's death in October 1776, to the arrival of Sir Eyre Coote in March 1779, the Council con&s;i&s;ted of four per&s;ons, excepting an in|terval of three or four months, in which I &s;tood alone again&s;t Mr. Ha&s;tings and Mr. Barwell; and in that period, I affirm that all the mi&s;chiefs, with which you are now oppre&s;&s;ed, took their birth, and grew into effects, which by this time, I fear, are not to be retrieved.&mdash;Your trea&s;uries are empty;&mdash;your debts are in&s;upportable;&mdash;your inve&s;tment, when you have any, is paid for by bills on the Com|pany, and two thirds of India have been laid wa&s;te. With the&s;e facts before you, is it po&s;&s;ible for the Legi&s;lature to reject the number, under which the Company's affairs were wi&s;ely and happily conduc|ted in India, and voluntarily prefer that, under which every thing has been done, which this very law profe&s;&s;es to condemn, and mo&s;t &s;trongly pro|hibits?</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="51">
By the &s;eventeenth and eighteenth clau&s;es of the a nended bill, the &s;ituation of a Commander in Chief of all the Company's forces in India is now provi|ded for. At la&s;t it has been di&s;covered, that &s;uch an office exi&s;ts. I have no objection to the voice and precedence given him in the Supreme Council, or at the &s;ubordinate Councils of Fort St. George and Bombay, when he &s;hall happen to be at either of them.&mdash;But I &s;trongly object to the &s;ituation, in which his arrival there will place the re&s;pective Commanders in Chief at tho&s;e two Pre&s;idencies. He not only &s;uper&s;edes them in rank, but reduces them to &s;ilence. During <HI>his</HI> &s;tay, they are only to have a &s;eat, but no voice, in the Council. The Hou&s;e will ob&s;erve that this is a civil office, not a military command; but, even on the &s;tricte&s;t mili|tary ideas, the provi&s;ion is ab&s;urd. The arrival of a &s;uperior officer di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the inferior, but does not annihilate him; he &s;till continues &s;econd in command, with a real and effective, though not with an equal authority. For what rea&s;on he is in&s;tant|ly to be converted into a mute, I cannot conceive. Naturally he ought to be better informed than a &s;tranger concerning the affairs of the Pre&s;idency, where he has commanded. But the object of the clau&s;e is to filence the per&s;on, who, having the be&s;t information, ought to be &s;pecially con&s;ulted. It ought to be con&s;idered too, whether gentlemen of high rank in the army, whether a general officer in the King's &s;ervice, who may happen to command upon the coa&s;t, be likely to &s;ubmit to this &s;ort of
<PB N="51" REF="52">
treatment, or how far it may wound the honourable feelings and &s;pirit of the profe&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P>Sir, I &s;hall leave the remaining regulations of the bill to other gentlemen, who I believe have con&s;i|dered them with proper attention, and go at once to that article, which, I confe&s;s, is to me more im|portant than all the re&s;t. I mean the new judica|ture, which the bill introduces into the criminal law of this country. I perceive that, in the appre|hen&s;ion of &s;ome gentlemen, this part of the bill has been con&s;iderably corrected and improved by the amendments made in the Committee, and that &s;ome gentlemen, who objected to it at fir&s;t, are now &s;atis|fied. I am truly &s;orry for it; becau&s;e I wi&s;h that the principle of every mea&s;ure, which I deem to be dangerous to the con&s;titution, &s;hould appear at once to the public view, undi&s;gui&s;ed, in its real &s;hape, and in the colours that belong to it. <HI>They</HI> deceive them&s;elves gro&s;&s;ly who imagine that that, which is e&s;&s;entially wrong, can ever be formally right. It cannot be corrected or improved, becau&s;e the defect is in the e&s;&s;ence, not in the form. And why &s;hould you lay a&s;ide the trial by jury in the ca&s;e of Indian delinquents? I have yet heard no one affirmative rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for it. Is it &s;u&s;pected that a Jury will not do ju&s;tice? You have no ground for the &s;u&s;picion; on the contrary, in the only ca&s;e in point, in the only ca&s;e of Indian delinquency that has been pro&s;ecuted in a court of common law, the Jury did their duty. I do not mean to enter into the merits of the pro&s;ecution of Mr. Stratton and Mr. Brooke for
<PB N="52" REF="53">
di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing and impri&s;oning Lord Pigot; it is &s;uf|ficient for my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to &s;ay, that the pub|lic in general thought that tho&s;e per&s;ons de&s;erved to be &s;everely puni&s;hed, and expected that they would be &s;o. Why were they not? The Jury did <HI>their</HI> part in finding them guilty. If they were not &s;ufficiently puni&s;hed, it was the fault of the Bench. Now, ob|&s;erve the con&s;equence: You lay a&s;ide the Jury, who, in the only in&s;tance in point, did every thing that depended on them to bring the criminals to condign puni&s;hment, and you think you are &s;ure of ju&s;tice, in uniting the incompatible offices of Judge and Jury in the &s;ame per&s;ons, who, the only time they were tried, have totally di&s;appointed the public ex|pectation of public ju&s;tice. But all rea&s;on and ar|gument are u&s;ele&s;s again&s;t power. If a Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons can, on any terms, con&s;ent, in any in|&s;tance, to aboli&s;h the trial by Jury, and if the peo|ple at large are in&s;en&s;ible of the danger of &s;uch a precedent, individuals, who have done their duty, mu&s;t &s;ubmit to their &s;hare in the mi&s;chief, which they could not prevent. I fear the temper and cha|racter of the nation are changed. Though I am not an old man, I can remember a time, when an attempt of this nature would have thrown the whole king|dom into a flame. Had it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">een made when a great man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">he late Earl of Chatham.</NOTE>, who is now no more, had a &s;eat in this Hou&s;e, he would have &s;tarted from the bed of &s;ickne&s;s, he would have &s;olicited &s;ome friendly hand to depo&s;it 
<PB N="53" REF="54">
him on this floor, and from this &s;tation, with a mo|narch's voice, would have called the kingdom to arms to oppo&s;e it. But <HI>he</HI> is dead, and has left nothing in this world, that re&s;embles him. He is dead, and the &s;en&s;e, and honour, and character, and under&s;tanding of the nation are dead with him. But it &s;eems there is a <HI>nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> that &s;uper&s;edes all objections. Ju&s;tice mu&s;t be done, and criminals mu&s;t be puni&s;hed. Sir, it requires &s;ome fortitude; it requires patience, long exerci&s;ed, to endure &s;o gro&s;s a mockery. The bill, that threatens future puni&s;hment to future crimes, gives you a &s;pecial earne&s;t of its &s;incerity, in &s;heltering every offence, and protecting every offender who has hitherto exi&s;ted, or who does exi&s;t at this hour. The pre|&s;ent law opens its bo&s;om to receive them, and there they are &s;afe: nay, it carries its precaution farther; it provides for the &s;ecurity of crimes <HI>in e&s;&s;e,</HI> that are actually unfini&s;hed, and allows a &s;uf|ficient time, in which they may be compleated. When the&s;e honourable &s;ervices are accompli&s;hed, &s;trict Ju&s;tice is then to take her &s;eat. From that moment we are never to &s;ee any thing but her &s;word. When the whole harve&s;t has been plundered, when the field it&s;elf has been trampled into du&s;t, you denounce racks and gibbets to the petty larceny, that hereafter may glean a few ears of corn. I have done my part to the utmo&s;t of my little judge|ment and ability. From tho&s;e, to whom more has been given, more will be expected. What I have &s;aid will not be u&s;ele&s;s, if it &s;ugge&s;ts the materials
<PB N="54" REF="55">
of reflection to others, and furni&s;hes employment for greater abilities.</P>
<P>The other regulations of the bill may be thought to require immediate di&s;patch. If they are proper to be executed at all, they cannot be carried too &s;oon into effect. But no argument of that kind can be applied to the clau&s;es, that regard the Judicature. The bill, on the face of it, expre&s;&s;es no particular hurry to puni&s;h any body.&mdash;For what po&s;&s;ible rea|&s;on then, &s;hould this part of the bill be &s;o urgently pre&s;&s;ed forward to keep pace with the re&s;t?&mdash;The pre&s;ent Admini&s;tration, we are told, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the confidence, and are at all times ready to appeal to the judgement of the People. Let us &s;ee whether they are ready to act up to their profe&s;&s;ions. Sure|ly, Sir, there never can be an occa&s;ion more proper for an appeal to the &s;en&s;e of the nation, than when Government is going to introduce a new mode of trial into the law of this land, which, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, deprives a part of the people of their com|mon right, and which, on &s;imilar pretences, may be extended to the whole kingdom. If the nation acquie&s;ces, you lo&s;e nothing by the delay. If not, you are bound by your principles to relinqui&s;h the attempt.</P>
<P>Allow me a word at parting to an honourable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Major John Scott, member for We&s;tloo.</NOTE>, and a learned<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Henry Dundas, E&s;q. member for Edinburgh&s;hire.</NOTE> gentleman: to one of whom I am much indebted, and to the other, &s;pecially engaged. The honourable gentleman a&s;&s;ures the Hou&s;e, that
<PB N="55" REF="56">
he is not the repre&s;entative of Mr. Ha&s;tings, though a con&s;iderable part of his life be employed in attack|ing, defending, and re&s;enting for that gentleman. I ob&s;erve it to his credit, that, although he is not a principal in the&s;e que&s;tions, he takes part in them with no le&s;s activity and zeal, than if the cau&s;e were directly and e&s;&s;entially his own. Between the ho|nourable gentleman and me there is not, nor ever has been, any per&s;onal &s;ubject of offence. In one &s;en&s;e therefore, I may be permitted to con&s;ider him as the repre&s;entative of Mr. Ha&s;tings, &s;ince every man of honour is properly the repre&s;entative of an ab|&s;ent friend. This, I pre&s;ume, was the principle, on which the honourable gentleman mu&s;t have acted, when he very lately created an opportunity of reci|ting to the Hou&s;e &s;ome tedious pa&s;&s;ages from a let|ter of ten years &s;tanding, which, pronouncing it to be extremely dull, he naturally, and I cannot &s;ay unwarrantably, concluded to be mine. But his ea|gerne&s;s to puni&s;h the guilty, made him forget that the Hou&s;e was innocent. The honourable gentle|man had no mercy upon either. Not confining him&s;elf to my &s;uppo&s;ed writings, he thought it a good opportunity to produce &s;ome &s;erious charges again&s;t my conduct. To the&s;e la&s;t, my an&s;wer upon the in&s;tant, I believe was thought &s;ufficient. My own feelings a&s;&s;ured me, that I carried the &s;en&s;e of the Hou&s;e along with me. To his a&s;&s;ertion, that we went to India pre-determined to declare war with Mr. Ha&s;tings at the moment of our arrival, I &s;aid, that the moment of our arrival gave us an
<PB N="56" REF="57">
in&s;ight into his conduct, which made it impo&s;&s;i|ble for us, as hone&s;t men, to unite with him. Contrary to all his own repeated declarations and profe&s;&s;ions re&s;pecting a pacific &s;y&s;tem, we found the Company's army engaged by him in the extir|pation of the Rohilla nation, with whom we had lately been in alliance, and with whom the Engli&s;h had no quarrel whatever, for the &s;ole and acknow|ledged purpo&s;e of gaining a &s;um of money. We found he had &s;old the extirpation of a whole people, who had never offended us, for forty lacks of rupees; not a rupee of which had been paid, though the &s;ervice was compleated. We found a third part of the whole military force of Bengal had marched to places, &s;o remote from our own territory, that none of the ordinary maps of Hindo&s;tan went far enough north to include their &s;ituation. I &s;ubmit to judgement, whether the&s;e facts alone did not oblige us to alter our opinion, not only of Mr. Ha&s;tings's political conduct, but of his per&s;onal character. The prejudices we carried with us to India were pa&s;&s;ionately and almo&s;t ab|&s;urdly in his favour. I need not enter farther into the merits of a que&s;tion, on which every tribunal, that was competent to examine it, has formally pro|nounced condemnation again&s;t him. On the 28th of November, 1775, the Court of Directors unani|mou&s;ly re&s;olved, <Q REND="inline">"That the agreement made with Sujah Dowlah, and the then Governor, (Mr. Ha&s;tings) for the hire of a part of the Compa|ny's troops for the reduction of the Rohilla coun|try,
<PB N="57" REF="58">
and the &s;ub&s;equent &s;teps taken for the car|rying on that war, were founded on wrong poli|cy, were contrary to the general orders of the Company, for keeping the troops within the bounds of the provinces, and for not extending their conque&s;ts; and were al&s;o contrary to <HI>tho&s;e general principles of ju&s;tice,</HI> which the Company wi&s;h &s;hould be &s;upported."</Q></P>
<P>Even his &s;pecial friends the Proprietors, on this occa&s;ion concurred with the Directors. Except that he had intere&s;t enough in that quarter to get the re|ference to <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> omitted, the whole body of the Proprietors, <HI>un&acirc; voce,</HI> condemned him. On the 6th of December, 1775, they re&s;olved unanimou&s;ly, <Q REND="inline">"That notwith&s;tanding this Court hath the highe&s;t opinion of the &s;ervices and integrity of Warren Ha&s;tings, E&s;q. and cannot admit a &s;u&s;picion of corrupt motives operating on his conduct with|out proof; yet they are of opinion, with their Court of Directors, that the agreement made with Sujah Dowlah for the hire of a part of the Company's troops for the reduction of the Ro|hilla country, and the &s;ub&s;equent &s;teps taken for carrying on that war, were founded on wrong policy, were contrary to the general orders of the Company frequently repeated, for keeping their troops within the bounds of the provinces, and for not extending their territories; and were al&s;o contrary to tho&s;e general principles, which the Company wi&s;h &s;hould be &s;upported."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="59">
The honourable gentleman was then plea&s;ed to charge me with having oppo&s;ed General Clavering on a particular occa&s;ion, but with &s;o much appa|rent reluctance, and in terms of &s;o much doubt and apprehen&s;ion, as evidently betrayed the dependence of my &s;ituation. A difference of opinion &s;eems a &s;trange proof of dependance. He concluded how|ever that I was bound by &s;ome &s;ecret in&s;tructions to follow the dictates of General Clavering, and that, when I refu&s;ed to be guided by him, I hazarded my employment. This, indeed, if it were true, would be a &s;erious charge not only again&s;t me, but again&s;t Ge|neral Clavering him&s;elf, who&s;e memory the honour|able gentleman profe&s;&s;es to re&s;pect, and again&s;t the noble Lord<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Lord North.</NOTE> in the blue ribband, by whom alone &s;uch in&s;tructions could have been given. The ho|nourable gentleman, however, has in &s;ome degree an|&s;wered his own charge. Forgetting every thing that he had &s;aid of my &s;uppo&s;ed dependence on my col|leagues, he almo&s;t in the &s;ame breath a&s;&s;ured the Hou&s;e, that, with re&s;pect to General Clavering and Colonel Mon&s;on, I was <HI>primus inter pares,</HI> and that being at the head of a majority, I had in effect the whole government in my hands. If that be true, my colleagues were no more than cyphers at my di&s;po&s;al. But in reality, the charge and the defence are equally trifling. I differed with General Cla|vering, not once but often, as the honourable gen|tleman will find, if he will look over our proceed|ings.
<PB N="59" REF="60">
Men of real honour, though generally united, and acting together on the &s;ame general principles, will often di&s;agree, and when they di&s;agree, will be ready to declare it. Men of a different character, uniting on a different principle, will never di&s;agree in particulars, as long as their general engagement to each other &s;ub&s;i&s;ts. It is perfectly true that I felt and expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t anxiety at differing from General Clavering on a que&s;tion of impor|tance; but not for the rea&s;on &s;u&s;pected by the ho|nourable gentleman. I dreaded the con&s;truction, which ignorance and malignity would be ready enough to give to my concurring with Mr. Ha&s;|tings. I knew my &s;ituation. When I oppo&s;ed him, it was faction. When I concurred with him, it was corruption. The honourable gentleman, how|ever, has omitted a material part of the &s;tory. He has inadvertently neglected to inform the Hou&s;e that the Court of Directors, in their letter of the 5th of February 1777, <HI>intirely agreed</HI> with <HI>me</HI> on the point in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The honourable gentleman &s;ays that we &s;hould have acted wi&s;ely for the public &s;ervice, if, in&s;tead of looking back to the errors of former times, we had drawn a veil over every thing that was pa&s;t, and directed our efforts to future improvement. Sir, I am not of that opinion. I have no idea that &s;uch a plan would have been practicable, and I am &s;ure it would have been unju&s;t. Inju&s;tice is not valid be|cau&s;e it has been done. We could not ab&s;olutely &s;hut our ears to complaints. We could not &s;ay,
<PB N="60" REF="61">
that no man, who had been injured, &s;hould ever be redre&s;&s;ed. The Supreme Court of Judicature look|ed very far back indeed, when it was their object to make an example, and to hold it out to the natives. But if the contrary had been true;&mdash;if the honou|rable gentleman's ab&s;tract opinion were ever judi|cious, he forgets that we had no choice. He forgets that the Court of Directors pre&s;cribed to us the very conduct we ob&s;erved, and applauded us highly for pur&s;uing it.</P>
<P>The only point, on which I could not in&s;tant|ly recollect enough of the &s;ubject to give the honourable gentleman an immediate an&s;wer, re|garded the repre&s;entation, which he &s;ays, I drew up in December 1774, of the condition of Bengal at that time. He charges me with a wild exag|geration in &s;aying, that Bengal, even then, was <HI>reduced to the hazard of beggary and ruin.</HI> Sir, a mere que&s;tion of per&s;onal debate between the ho|nourable gentleman and me, would be of too little moment, even to our&s;elves, to be obtruded on the Hou&s;e, if it did not lead to information imme|diately connected with the general &s;ubject-matter of our pre&s;ent deliberation. You are going to make a law for the better government of Bengal. It is therefore proper you &s;hould inquire, what the &s;tate of Bengal was ten years ago, when the Legi&s;|lature fir&s;t interpo&s;ed for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. The Hou&s;e &s;hould next endeavour to po&s;&s;e&s;s it&s;elf of the events, which have happened in the interval, and
<PB N="61" REF="62">
then you will be able to determine, what is proba|bly the actual &s;tate of the object, concerning which you are going to exerci&s;e your legi&s;lative power.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e, I imagine, will hear with &s;urpri&s;e, that the fir&s;t intimation I received of the di&s;tre&s;s of the Government of Fort William, was in a private conver&s;ation with Mr. Ha&s;tings him&s;elf. On evi|dence of this kind, I certainly &s;hould think it im|proper to in&s;i&s;t, if it had not concurred with many recorded declarations made by Mr. Ha&s;tings to the &s;ame effect. The fundamental argument con&s;tantly u&s;ed by him in defence of the Rohilla war, was, the di&s;tre&s;s of the Company's affairs both at home and abroad. In his minute of the 3d December, 1774, he &s;ays,</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"All our advices, both public and private, re|pre&s;ented the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Company at home, as extreme. At the &s;ame time, &s;uch was the &s;tate of affairs in this Government, that for many years pa&s;t, the income of the year was found in|adequate to its expence, to defray which, a hea|vy bond debt, amounting at one time to a hun|dred and twenty-five lacks of rupees, had accu|mulated. By allowing the Vizier the military aid, which he required, a &s;aving of near one third of our military expences would be effected during the period of &s;uch a &s;ervice, and the &s;ti|pulation of forty lacks would afford an ample &s;upply to our trea&s;ury, and to the currency of the country."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="63">
On this declaration, our fir&s;t ob&s;ervation was, <HI>that urgent di&s;tre&s;s was implied in the violent nature of the remedy.</HI></P>
<P>The maxims of policy invented by Mr. Ha&s;tings to &s;upport the fact, accommodate them&s;elves per|fectly to the motives on which he acted.</P>
<P>30th Nov. 1774. <Q REND="inline">"If the internal re&s;ources of a &s;tate fail it, or are not equal to its occa&s;ional wants, whence can it obtain immediate relief, but from external means?"</Q></P>
<P>30th Nov. 1774. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall be always ready to profe&s;s, that I do reckon the probable acqui&s;ition of wealth among my rea&s;ons for taking up arms again&s;t my <HI>neigh|bours.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Ob&s;erve, Sir, that one of Mr. Ha&s;tings's motives for taking up arms again&s;t his <HI>neighbours,</HI> not again&s;t his <HI>enemies,</HI> is plainly and explicitly to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their wealth.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the actual di&s;tre&s;s of the Govern|ment and country of Bengal, I de&s;ire nothing to be believed on my own a&s;&s;ertion. On the 17th of Oc|tober, 1774, a day or two before our arrival at Cal|cutta, Mr. Ha&s;tings and his Council drew up a let|ter to the Court of Directors in defence of the Ro|hilla war, which they principally re&s;ted on <Q REND="inline">"the acquifition of forty lacks of rupees to the Com|pany, and of &s;o much &s;pecie added <HI>to the ex|hau&s;ted curreacy of the&s;e provinces:</HI>"</Q> not a rupee
<PB N="63" REF="64">
of which, however, was received until &s;ome time after our arrival.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the internal &s;tate of the provinces, I pre&s;ume that the evidence of the late Mr. Samuel Middleton, one of the olde&s;t and mo&s;t experienced of the Company's &s;ervants in Bengal, will be al|lowed to be conclu&s;ive. If it were not, I could &s;upport it by a ma&s;s of other evidence of equal au|thority. In his letter of the 5th of February 1775, near five months after our arrival, he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"When a very con&s;iderable portion, &s;uppo&s;ed even a third of the whole inhabitants, had peri&s;hed, the re|maining two thirds were obliged to pay for the lands now left without cultivators. The country has langui&s;hed ever &s;ince, <HI>and the evil continues enhancing every day.</HI>"</Q> Now, Sir, I think it will be admitted, that no de&s;cription of national or po|litical di&s;tre&s;s can ea&s;ily be exaggerated, which is founded on evidence and authorities &s;uch as the&s;e. But has any thing happened, &s;ince that time, to im|prove the &s;tate of the country?&mdash;Excepting the &s;hort interval, in which General Clavering's prin|ciples and authority prevailed, have you heard of any thing but war in all parts of India?&mdash;But the oppre&s;&s;ion and rebellion of Princes &s;ubject to your power?&mdash;Mutinies among the native troops for want of pay?&mdash;Extraction of &s;pecie from Bengal for the &s;upport of the other Pre&s;idencies, the enor|mous amount of which is &s;tated as the merit of Mr. Ha&s;tings?&mdash;Inve&s;tments bought with paper&mdash;and draughts on the Directors, and debts accumulating
<PB N="64" REF="65">
without end? Put the facts together, and then the Hou&s;e will be able to determine, whether the la|bour they have at la&s;t undertaken of correcting &s;o many di&s;orders, and recovering our Indian po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions from &s;o many di&s;tre&s;&s;es, be a ta&s;k of <HI>common</HI> magnitude, or likely to be accompli&s;hed by <HI>common</HI> men?</P>
<P>Now, Sir, having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the &s;erious part of the honourable gentleman's charge, I hope he will allow me to make a few ob&s;ervations on the manner and time, in which it was produced. Suppo&s;ing him for a moment to be the repre&s;entative of Mr. Ha&s;|tings, and to feel for that gentleman as &s;enfibly as he could do for him&s;elf, I beg leave to ob&s;erve to him, that his &s;everity to me is not ju&s;tified on any principle of retaliation. I never &s;ought for Mr. Ha&s;tings's letters. The honourable gentleman him|&s;elf brought them before the Hou&s;e, and trium|phantly referred the contents of them to an atten|tive examination. But, if it had been otherwi&s;e, I cannot admit, that an inoffen&s;ive plea&s;antry, which wounds no man, and &s;ometimes enlivens the gravity of debate, is equitably retorted by a &s;erious de|liberate attack upon the moral conduct or character of an opponent. It is not likely that I &s;hould ever have occa&s;ion to make a &s;imilar reflection on that of the honourable gentleman. His actions are too well guarded, and my di&s;po&s;ition to him is too ami|cable, to allow me to &s;uppo&s;e the probability of &s;uch a ca&s;e. Admitting it neverthele&s;s to happen, I cer|tainly &s;hould not follow the example he has &s;et me.
<PB N="65" REF="66">
I would not endeavour to take him by &s;urpri&s;e. I &s;hould not expect him to carry letters or tran&s;ac|tions of ten years &s;tanding, correctly in his me|mory. If I thought my&s;elf obliged to bring a charge of any kind again&s;t him, I &s;hould think my|&s;elf much more bound, in honour and in ju&s;tice, to give him previous notice of my intention, and warn him to prepare for his defence.</P>
<P>I am now to reply to the learned gentleman op|po&s;ite to me, and with that I &s;hall conclude. A challenge from him undoubtedly does me honour, for it &s;uppo&s;es, in <HI>his</HI> mind at lea&s;t, an idea, which does not exi&s;t in mine, and could not have occurred to any other, that, on the &s;ubject in que&s;tion, there is &s;ome approach to equality from me to him. Not being conver&s;ant in the forms of the Hou&s;e, I did not know, until &s;ome &s;ome hours later in the &s;ame evening, that I was at liberty to write down the words of gentlemen, uttered perhaps ha&s;tily in de|bate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Dundas had quoted words of Mr. Fox, which he &s;aid he had taken down two years ago.</NOTE>, for the purpo&s;e of an&s;wering them at a fu|ture occa&s;ion.&mdash;In a day or two after, I endeavour|ed to recollect the learned gentleman's words, and I believe I have taken them very exactly. If not, I hope he will do me the favour to correct them. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"That gentlemen had talked in a loo&s;e general way of di&s;obedience of orders, without coming to particulars;&mdash;that if they would point out in&s;tances, he &s;hould know where to <HI>grapple</HI>
<PB N="66" REF="67">
with them.&mdash;With re&s;pect to the Maratta war, he affirmed that Mr. Ha&s;tings was not guilty of di&s;obedience of orders;&mdash;that the Directors them&s;elves were to blame, in forming and en|couraging a plan of conque&s;t on the Malabar coa&s;t, and that Mr. Ha&s;tings, in commencing and pur&s;uing the Maratta war, had not di&s;obey|ed orders, but had conformed to the views of the Directors.&mdash;That Mr. Ha&s;tings neverthele&s;s was greatly to blame for violating the treaty of Poorunder. On the truth of the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, the learned gentleman challenged me, and de|clared him&s;elf ready to meet me at any time and on any ground<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Dundas a&s;&s;ented to the exactne&s;s of this recital of his words.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, Sir, that this language, e&s;pecial|ly from the learned gentleman, appeared to me very extraordinary. I hardly ever heard any thing with greater &s;urpri&s;e. He has employed him&s;elf, near two years together, with infinite indu&s;try and toil, in an inquiry into the abu&s;es that prevail in the India Company's &s;ervice.&mdash;He has publi&s;hed the re&s;ult of his laborious inve&s;tigations in many folio volumes, which, I verily believe, no man in the kingdom has read but my&s;elf.&mdash;The pre&s;ent bill, of which the learned gentleman is <HI>prochein ami</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A term u&s;ed in law for him, who is the next friend, or next of kin to a child in his nonage.</NOTE>, if not parent, &s;uppo&s;es <HI>wilful di&s;obedience</HI> in every de|partment of the &s;ervice;&mdash;the con&s;tant complaint
<PB N="67" REF="68">
of the Directors has been that their orders are not obeyed; and finally the right honourable gentle|man, who propo&s;es the bill, particularly urged and in&s;i&s;ted on the nece&s;&s;ity of conquering a &s;pirit of re|&s;i&s;tance, univer&s;ally prevailing among the Compa|ny's &s;ervants in India. On any other pre&s;umption, the clau&s;e would be &s;uperfluous. In the face of all this evidence and authority, the learned gentleman gravely a&s;&s;ures the Hou&s;e, that there have been no examples of di&s;obedience, or that the in&s;tances, if any, have not been material. He calls upon his opponents to come to particulars, and then he &s;hall know where to <HI>grapple</HI> with them. Sir, I will not weary the Hou&s;e with a multitude of quotations from the Company's records. They are filled with the very proofs and examples, which the learned gentleman calls for. Setting a&s;ide orders indifferent to the &s;ervants abroad, and which of cour&s;e they had no motive to di&s;obey, and &s;etting a&s;ide orders, which were capable of being converted to &s;ome pur|po&s;e of their own,&mdash;for the&s;e they have obeyed not only with exactne&s;s but o&s;tentation, I affirm that, &s;o far from its being difficult to find in&s;tances of di&s;obedience, the difficulty would be to point out an order of the Directors, that ever was regard|ed. The India Company little know, in what &s;ort of e&s;timation their Directors are held in India. But it is proper I &s;hould encounter the learned gentle|man on his own ground. Let him a&s;k the Direc|tors, what they think of the following examples. They are not mere facts, for which excu&s;es or pre|tences
<PB N="68" REF="69">
might be invented, but formal acts of di&s;o|bedience, deliberately avowed and defended on principle.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is the well-known ca&s;e of Mr. John Bri&s;tow, who had been recalled by Mr. Ha&s;tings from his &s;tation at Lucknow, without any charge whatever again&s;t his conduct, and whom the Direc|tors repeatedly ordered to be re-in&s;tated. Your Se|lect Committee <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ninth Report, page 56.</NOTE> have reported to you, in what manner tho&s;e orders were regarded. The general ground taken and avowed by Mr. Ha&s;tings was, that the orders in que&s;tion invaded <HI>his prerogative,</HI> and he &s;hould be degraded by obeying them.</P>
<P>The &s;econd is the ca&s;e of Mr. Francis Fowke, which has al&s;o been fully reported to you by your Select Committee. This gentleman was recalled from Benares by Mr. Ha&s;tings, who declared that there was <HI>no charge nor the &s;lighte&s;t imputation of a charge again&s;t him.</HI> The Directors repeatedly ordered him to be re-in&s;tated, but to no purpo&s;e. In their letter of the 27th of May, 1779, they &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"We have read, with a&s;toni&s;hment, your <HI>formal</HI> re&s;olution, to &s;u&s;pend the execution of our orders relative to Mr. Francis Fowke; your proceed|ings at large are now before us; we &s;hall take &s;uch mea&s;ures as appear nece&s;&s;ary for pre&s;erving the authority of the Court of Directors, and for preventing &s;uch in&s;tances of <HI>direct and wilful di&s;|obedience</HI> in our &s;ervants in time to come."</Q> On
<PB N="69" REF="70">
this occa&s;ion, the principle maintained by Mr. Bar|well was, that <Q REND="inline">"he mu&s;t decline an acquie&s;cence in <HI>any</HI> order, which had <HI>a tendency</HI> to bring the Government into di&s;repute."</Q></P>
<P>If the learned gentleman &s;ays, that the&s;e are in|&s;tances of no great moment, I &s;hall leave him to &s;ettle that que&s;tion with the Directors. In&s;tead of combating his opinion, I &s;hall take the liberty of a&s;king him, whether he &s;eriou&s;ly means to refer it to the Company's &s;ervants to determine, whether the orders they receive are material or not. If he does, I can venture to a&s;&s;ure him, that the latitude he allows is &s;ufficient to an&s;wer all their purpo&s;es, and that they are not &s;o unrea&s;onable, as to de&s;ire any greater.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of contracts alone has opened a wide and fertile field of di&s;obedience. The fundamental principle laid down by the Company was, that all contracts &s;hould be annual; that the Government &s;hould adverti&s;e for propo&s;als, and always give a preference to the lowe&s;t bidders. The&s;e rules, I pre&s;ume, would be deemed unexceptionable, if they did not limit the patronage of men in power in In|dia, or the profits of their friends. Mr. Ha&s;tings and Mr. Barwell gave all the contracts, to per&s;ons of their own choice, on their own terms, for five years in&s;tead of one, and without adverti&s;ing for propo&s;als. I beg the learned gentleman will attend to what the Directors them&s;elves have &s;aid upon the &s;ubject. In their letter of the 23d of December, 1778, among many other ob&s;ervations, they &s;ay,</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="71">
<HI>Par.</HI> 59. <Q REND="inline">"This <HI>wa&s;te of our property</HI> cannot be permitted. You <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Haftings and Mr. Barwell.</NOTE> have di&s;regarded our autho|rity, and di&s;obeyed our orders, in not taking the lowe&s;t offers."</Q></P>
<P N="77">77. <Q REND="inline">"In order to prevent the Company's money from being thus <HI>given away in future,</HI> we po&s;i|tively direct," &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P N="99">99. <Q REND="inline">"With the&s;e materials before you, the que&s;|tion is put, whether the contractor's terms, or the propo&s;als of Mr. John&s;on, &s;hall be accepted: Mr. Francis, in &s;trict conformity with the Com|pany's orders, and according to e&s;tabli&s;hed u&s;age, was of opinion, that the contract &s;hould be ad|verti&s;ed. Mr. Barwell thought the pre&s;ent con|tractor had, the preceding year, by making low propo&s;als (to u&s;e his own phra&s;e) ejected Mr. John&s;on, in hopes of obtaining future indulgence, and therefore he could not he&s;itate to give his vote for Mr. John&s;on."</Q></P>
<P N="100">100. <Q REND="inline">"However &s;trange Mr. Barwell's motive, for giving his vote for Mr. John&s;on, may appear to us, we mu&s;t confe&s;s, the Governor General's rea&s;ons for concurring therein were &s;till more extraordinary. His words are, <HI>I di&s;approve of publi&s;hing for propo&s;als; this contract is reduced too low already, and will require a vigilant attention to it on the part of the commanding officer of the corps of the army, that it will be duly performed;</HI> to which he adds, <HI>that according to the be&s;t informa|tion</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="72">
<HI>he had been able to obtain, little profit would be made by the contractor, if he did his duty.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P N="101">101. <Q REND="inline">"But although the Governor General has thought proper to expre&s;s &s;o direct and pointed a di&s;approbation of the mode adopted and po&s;itive|ly enjoined by the Company, for conducting &s;o great a branch of their affairs, as that of the army contract, we neverthele&s;s adhere to the propriety of the Court's orders," &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>If this part of the &s;ubject &s;hould be thought to require any farther proof or explanation, the Re|cords of the India Hou&s;e will furni&s;h it in abun|dance. If the learned gentleman be &s;till di&s;&s;atisfied, if he &s;till has any pa&s;&s;ion for combat, I &s;hall leave him to <HI>grapple</HI> with the Court of Directors.</P>
<P>I do not perfectly under&s;tand the learned gentle|man, when he &s;ays, in the &s;ame breath, that Mr. Ha&s;tings is not an&s;werable for the &s;econd Maratta war, <HI>though he was greatly to blame for violating the treaty of Poorundur.</HI> The breach of the treaty and the war are one and the &s;ame act. When he broke the treaty, he created the war. But it &s;eems, he did it in compliance with in&s;tructions from the Court of Directors. Had that been the fact, it would have redounded to the credit of Mr. Ha&s;|tings, if, in that in&s;tance, he had treated their or|ders with the &s;ame di&s;regard, which he did in every other. He would then have had the real merit of &s;upporting the permanent fundamental principles, the wi&s;e pacific policy of the India Company again&s;t an incidental order from a fluctuating Direction.

But it is not &s;o. Sir, I am not a profe&s;&s;ed advocate of the Court of Directors, and they are very well able to defend them&s;elves. In this in&s;tance, how|ever, it is but ju&s;tice to them to &s;ay, that they have not been ju&s;tly accu&s;ed. Fir&s;t of all, let us con&s;ider what the Company's acknowledged &s;y&s;tem is.

<P>A word or two of per&s;onal application to the learned gentleman, and I have done.

moral character of the man; and that having pur|&s;ued this middle, even cour&s;e, without the &s;malle&s;t inclination to either &s;ide, he had not had the good fortune to &s;atisfy any body.

<P>This, Sir, I conceive, is not the language of a man very much undecided in his opinion, or who he&s;itates between the extremes of cen&s;ure and ap|probation.
<PB N="78" REF="79">
If it be, I &s;hould be glad to know, in what terms the learned gentleman would expre&s;s him&s;elf, when he &s;eriou&s;ly intended to condemn. I can truly a&s;&s;ure him that I am not acquainted with any man, &s;o ho&s;tile to Mr. Ha&s;tings, as not to be contented with this de&s;cription of his conduct. So peremptory and decided is the condemnation ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the&s;e Re&s;olutions, that &s;everal of my friends in India concluded they had been drawn up by <HI>me.</HI> Knowing nothing of the &s;tate of men and things in this country, they drew their conclu&s;ion from the knowledge they had of my opinions, and from that very character of deci&s;ion, which is &s;tamped on the face of the Re&s;olutions, and which the learned gentleman thinks it prudent to di&s;claim. The fondne&s;s and applau&s;e, with which he has lately &s;poken of Mr. Ha&s;tings, have compleatly reconciled him to that gentleman's friends.

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="appendix">
<HEAD>No. I.</HEAD>
<P>IN the cour&s;e of the debate on the 16th of July, it was infi&s;ted by a learned gentleman, in defence of the new Judicature, that the erection of &s;ome new tribunal was nece&s;&s;ary, for that Juries would be found unequal to the ta&s;k of trying mi&s;demeanors committed in India. In &s;upport of this po&s;ition, he contended that the trials of offences within the pur|view of this bill would probably be of great length; that many might la&s;t more than a week; and that &s;ome might la&s;t even more than a month. He then proceeded to ob&s;erve, that common Jurymen were not <HI>fit</HI> to have &s;uch cau&s;es brought before them. With regard to the probable length of the trials, it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible that trials &s;hould be &s;pun out to &s;uch a length, as he &s;eemed to apprehend, even in this new Court, though in &s;ome re&s;pects it &s;eems calculated for the purpo&s;es of delay. When any te&s;timony is to be brought from India, a mandamus mu&s;t i&s;&s;ue from the King's Bench, and the de|po&s;itions,
<PB N="81" REF="82">
taken by virtue of it, mu&s;t be tran&s;|mitted to England, before even the commi&s;&s;ion can i&s;&s;ue from the Court of Chancery for holding the Court. All the te&s;timony, that is to come from abroad, mu&s;t be collected, even before the Court is in exi&s;tence. What rea&s;on then is there to fear that, when the foreign evidence is to be thus pre|pared, trials would in general be of long conti|nuance? If they &s;hould, it would be owing, not to difficulties in the procuring or examination of evi|dence, but to the power given to the Commi&s;&s;ioners to adjourn from time to time, as they &s;hall think fit; a power which would indeed, in all probability, be productive of the greate&s;t delays in the admini&s;tra|tion of ju&s;tice. But it may be a&s;ked, why a Jury is not as competent to try a mi&s;demeanor committed in India, as one committed in England; and why a greater time &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary for the trial of the former than of the latter? The affirmative re&s;ts on an a&s;&s;ertion, which, &s;tanding without argument, need only be denied. No man can be tried, even under the provi&s;ions of this bill, on an accumulated or general charge. The information or indictment mu&s;t be for &s;ome &s;pecific offence or offences, to which the party is to plead, and upon which i&s;&s;ue mu&s;t be joined. If there be any te&s;timony in India, it is to be tran&s;mitted under a mandamus to England. After all this preparation then, (a preparation which is pre&s;cribed by the bill) a mi&s;demeanor committed in India may be tried by a Jury with as little diffi|culty, and in as little time, as one committed in
<PB N="82" REF="83">
England. The learned gentleman's doctrine is of the mo&s;t dangerous tendency: it leads to the abo|lition of trial by Jury. All the arguments, which have been u&s;ed to &s;hew the inconvenience and im|propriety of this mode of trial in ca&s;es of offences committed abroad, might with equal force be urged again&s;t the propriety of it in ca&s;es of offences com|mitted in England; and very probably we &s;hall &s;oon have them introduced for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Let it be admitted, for the &s;ake of argument, that the inve&s;tigation of Indian mi&s;demeanors will probably take up a long time, and that common Juries are not <HI>fit</HI> to have &s;uch cau&s;es brought before them;&mdash;&s;till it does not follow that there is any nece&s;&s;ity for aboli&s;hing trial by Jury. All Indian mi&s;demeanors might be tried by &s;pecial Juries, and this would obviate the fa&s;tidious objection, on which &s;o much &s;tre&s;s has been laid. Special Juries are not <Q REND="inline">"cho&s;en out of the ma&s;s of mankind,"</Q> but out of the principal freeholders of the county. Men as little &s;ubject to bias, <Q REND="inline">"as little likely to go into common ale-hou&s;es, and enter into porter-club conver&s;ations upon the evidence before them,"</Q> and as little liable to be mi&s;led, as the members of either Hou&s;e of Parliament.</P>
<P>As for the length of the trials, let the inve&s;tiga|tion be ever &s;o long, a Jury is competent to it. With deference to learned authority, there is no rea&s;on to admit that <Q REND="inline">"his going into his box, and remaining there locked up till he has given his verdict, is an e&s;&s;ential characteri&s;tic of a Jury|man."</Q>&mdash;It
<PB N="83" REF="84">
is e&s;&s;ential that, after the Jury leave the bar, they &s;hall not &s;peak with the parties or their agents; and that they &s;hall receive no fre&s;h evidence: and it is common, in order to prevent intemperance, or cau&s;ele&s;s delay, to keep them without meat, drink, fire, or candle; but I affirm that this is not e&s;&s;ential: the law &s;ays, that, by permi&s;&s;ion of the Judge, they may be allowed fire, candle, and refre&s;hments. That permi&s;&s;ion would always be given, when the length and nature of the te&s;timony might render much deliberation nece&s;&s;ary, and thus the Jury would have it in their power, without any material inconvenience to them&s;elves, to give full con&s;ideration to every part of the bu&s;i|ne&s;s before them.</P>

<P>"I entirely approve of the Honourable the Pre|fident's conduct in the <HI>receipt</HI> of complimentary nuzzers.</P>
<P>"The prejudices of the natives of Hindo&s;tan, bigoted to their ancient cu&s;toms, make it <HI>ab&s;o|lutely impo&s;&s;ible</HI> to avoid deviating in this particu|lar from the words of the Act of Parliament! The &s;pirit of the act is not, however, by this

&s;eeming deviation, departed from, but regarded with an attention, <HI>which &s;hews the mo&s;t &s;crupulous re&s;pect to the re&s;trictions of the Legi&s;lature!</HI> Nuz|zers are not made to the man, but to the &s;tation he fills, and are very different in their nature from <HI>gratuitous rewards,</HI> or the gifts, denomi|nated pre&s;ents; I therefore cannot but equally honour the principle, while I admire the ju&s;tne&s;s of the motive, on which official nuzzers, or compliments are <HI>accepted</HI> by the Governor Gene|ral. I &s;ee their <HI>acceptance</HI> in a light of the greate&s;t propriety, perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the ideas of the Company, and regardful of what they have invariably recommended, attention to the particular prejudices, manners, and di&s;po&s;i|tions of the natives!</P>
<P>"The Governor General has thought proper to &s;ubmit the nuzzers, made to <HI>his</HI> &s;tation, to the Court of Directors, to be appropriated agree|ably to their plea&s;ure. Small as the object is to the Company and to the nation, it gives dignity to <HI>his</HI> character as guardian of the public inte|re&s;ts, and obviates all mi&s;repre&s;entation of the principle and the motive, which has induced him to a compliance with the rooted prejudices and manners of the A&s;iatics. <HI>My</HI> experience, from a long re&s;idence in this country, convinces me of the <HI>real nece&s;&s;ity</HI> there is of re&s;pecting u&s;ages <HI>in immaterial points,</HI> and which, di&s;re|garded, would be followed by impre&s;&s;ions re|&s;ulting from a conduct repugnant to A&s;iatic

notions of propriety and deference. I might here make a tender to the Public of the trivial nuzzers, to the acceptance of which my &s;tation has <HI>impelled</HI> me; but what is proper in the Go|vernor General, would in me, I apprehend, ap|pear <HI>rather in the light of a con&s;equential in&s;ignifi|cant di&s;play of rigidne&s;s in exce&s;s!!</HI> The amount of my complimentary nuzzers of a gold mohur, and five rupees, from the period of my arrival at the Pre&s;idency, exceeds not the &s;um of two hun|dred and fifty rupees, exclu&s;ive of a compliment from the Nabob of Arcot of a few pieces of cloth, the produce of his country, and two &s;hauls, a compliment more than returned by my&s;elf in the manufactures of Bengal, to the amount of three thou&s;and Sicca rupees."</P>
