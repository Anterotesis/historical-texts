<HEAD>ADDRESS to the AUDIENCE by PUNCH, on the OPENING of the MICROCOSM.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>HUZZA! my hearts! our MICROCOSMIC Puppet-Show</L>
<L>Mu&s;t &s;tand; &s;ince fo&s;t'ring friends concur to prop it &s;o.&mdash;</L>
<L>Let me be hang'd but I'm in perfect extacy,</L>
<L>Such a bright blooming bank of the fair &s;ex to &s;ee;</L>
<L>So inter&s;pers'd with beaux, in gay variety,</L>
<L>That it fulfils my wi&s;h, ev'n to &s;atiety.&mdash;</L>
<L>For, we, (tho' wooden mimies of humanity)</L>
<L>Are not &s;uch blocks as not to feel th' urbanity</L>
<L>Of your obliging readine&s;s to come to us</L>
<L>In our new edifice, &mdash;well, an't it &s;umptuous?&mdash;</L>
<L>Are not all quondam much-complain'd of grievances</L>
<L>Amply redre&s;s'd by our well-plann'd contrivances?</L>
<L>Have not our brains been rack'd, and our poor pur&s;es drain'd,</L>
<L>To &s;hew that no convenience was by us re&s;train'd?</L>
<L>Have we not built a cover'd way to &s;helter you;</L>
<L>Where no bla&s;ts ru&s;&s;ie, rains wet, or funs &s;welter you;</L>
<L>A green room,&mdash;lucky thought! where lolling, at her ca&s;e,</L>
<L>STELLA may li&s;ten to her STREPHON'S flatteries</L>
<L>And point again&s;t his heart all her ma&s;qu'd batteries;</L>
<L>Here may of &s;candal-&s;preading prudes forget her awe,</L>
<L>Adju&s;t her dre&s;s, balls, parties, drums&mdash;<HI>&amp; catera.</HI>&mdash;</L>
<L>Your entrance to our room la&s;t year, was odious:</L>
<L>But our new CORRIDOR is quite commodious.</L>
<L><PB N="iv" REF="3">Our MICROCOSM &s;hines with a &s;plendid dignity</L>
<L>Which may defy the cavils of malignity,</L>
<L>And flatter us with hopes of your benignity.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then on the in&s;ide, many faults are mended too,</L>
<L>Things, in no puppet &s;how 'till ours, attended to.&mdash;</L>
<L>Ob&s;erve, in true; per&s;pective, &s;tage and gallery,</L>
<L>Not like our former dog-hole, &s;queez'd and all awry:</L>
<L>Ob&s;erve our light arrang'd in order curious,</L>
<L>Nor to the audience or the &s;cene injurious.</L>
<L>Ob&s;erve our high-rais'd benches curv'd with &s;ymmetry,</L>
<L>If any thinks he can outdo us, he may try.&mdash;</L>
<L>Ingre&s;s and egre&s;s, now, are free and elegant,</L>
<L>What more is wanting?&mdash; by my con&s;cience! tell I can't, &mdash;</L>
<L>Save WELCOME:&mdash; which I &s;natch this opportunity</L>
<L>Of giving in the name of our community.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thrice welcome <HI>all!</HI>&mdash;our lib'ral ho&s;pitality</L>
<L>Is not con&s;in'd to rank alone, or quality,</L>
<L>To charms or wealth:&mdash;(yet if we made a difference)</L>
<L>Such &s;urely are entitled to &s;ome preference.</L>
<L>Our doors are &s;hut to none; except &s;uch trumpery</L>
<L>As never ought be &s;een in decent company;</L>
<L>With that riff-raff we evermore mu&s;t be at war,</L>

<L>DECORUM is our guide rever'd, our governor,</L>
<L>Who&s;e well-dige&s;ted laws admit no &s;loven here.</L>
<L>For if a peer come like a porter jacketed,</L>
<L>Retire he mu&s;t:&mdash;tho' up he rai&s;e his back at it,</L>
<L>And &s;orm, and &s;ume, and bounce, and flounce, and racket it.</L>
<L>All this may &s;hew what &s;tudious care we have of you;</L>
<L><PB N="v" REF="4">Now, in return, one favour let us crave of you;</L>

<L>The ladies' <HI>caps</HI> are ri&s;en to &s;uch enormity,</L>
<L>That, far from being a grace, they're a deformity:</L>

<L>Ten guineas that her <HI>face</HI> is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound the centre on't.)</L>
<L>In &s;uch a room as ours they're quite prepo&s;terous;</L>

<L>No. <HI>(kneels)</HI> PUNCH upon his knees in all humility,</L>
<L>Implores <HI>you,</HI> the true patterns of civility,</L>
<L>To lay them by when e'er you deign to vi&s;it us,</L>
<L>'Tis for the common good I'm thus &s;ollicitous.</L>
<L>Do, lay them by; hide not each other from our view:</L>
<L>El&s;e 'tis indifferent whether many come or few.</L>
<L>The kind polite compliance well would &s;uit you all</L>
<L>And each would feel the conde&s;cen&s;ion mutual.</L>
<L><HI>(Turns a&s;ide &s;till kneeling and cla&s;ping his hands.)</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O Nature! hear my pray'r;&mdash;&s;ubmi&s;s I a&s;k your aid</L>
<L>To free your ma&s;ter-pieces from this ma&s;querade;</L>
<L>You form'd them perfect; artle&s;s you intended them;</L>
<L>But French-frizeurs have, for the wor&s;e, &s;ince mended them.</L>
<L>Why will they puni&s;h <HI>us</HI> who ne'er offended them?</L>
<L><HI>(He ri&s;es and comes forward.)</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nought can be call'd a SHOW, where nought is to be &s;een,</L>
<L>Where ev'ry bodies' light &s;ome huge head-robe is in.</L>
<L>The eye &s;hou'd have free &s;cope to rove ad libitum.&mdash;</L>
<L>Our &s;cenes are fine; but we in vain contribute 'em,</L>
<L>If, only to gauze-caps, we can exhibit 'em.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Suppo&s;e, the men a fancy took to wear their hats</L>
<L>With the broad leaves &s;louch'd down; enough to &s;care the rats.</L>
<L>Wou'd you not think it rude? and call them Savages</L>
<L>Who, on your comforts, made &s;uch horrid ravages?</L>
<L><PB N="vi" REF="5">But they'll not dare to do it&mdash;in <HI>this</HI> place I mean,</L>
<L>They know there's a point I could di&s;grace 'em in</L>
<L>And of my vengeance give the clowns a &s;pecimen.&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now to conclude: if you bring di&s;po&s;itions</L>
<L>Vacant to harmle&s;s mirth, our exhibitions,</L>
<L>(Devoid of ribaldry and malice &s;ini&s;ter</L>
<L>Some food, perhaps, to &s;uch light mirth may mini&s;ter:</L>
<L>We our be&s;t efforts will exert, to coax you here:</L>
<L>And you will candid &s;mile when our arch jokes you hear.</L>
<L>You have too much good &s;en&s;e and are too affable</L>
<L>Not to laugh out at what is truly laughable.</L>
<L>You know,&mdash;that all our plea&s;antries here local are,</L>
<L>That our performances are pa&s;times jocular,</L>
<L>To plea&s;e the auricular organ and the ocular.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But who&s;o comes re&s;olved on peevi&s;h critici&s;m,</L>
<L>Watching to pick an hole for &s;ome flat wittici&s;m,</L>
<L>Smartly with trite <HI>Joe Miller</HI>'s <HI>Je&s;ts</HI> to tickle us,</L>
<L>We caution him to curb his gibe ridiculous.</L>
<L>Our &s;tage &s;hall be no butt, to vent his je&s;t upon:</L>
<L>We're thorns, we're thi&s;tles; we &s;hall &s;ting if pre&s;t upon.</L>
<L>And tho' we &s;corn the &s;neers of &s;uch wit-coalheavers,</L>
<L>Yet we have <HI>Rowlands</HI> ready for their <HI>Olivers.</HI>&mdash;</L>
