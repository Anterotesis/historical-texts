<HEAD>THE DIVINE MODEL, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>"ENDEAVOUR to imitate your Sa|viour," &s;aid Mrs. Bingham, one evening, to her maid Martha, whom &s;he was carefully in&s;tructing in the duties of religion. "Imitate my Saviour!" repeated Martha; "dear Madam! I thought he was &s;o much rai&s;ed above us, that it would be quite pre|&s;umptuous to try to be like him."</P>
<P>"It is true, Martha," replied Mrs. Bingham, "we can never be as perfect as our divine Ma&s;ter, but the nearer we ap|proach to the example he has &s;et us, the better we &s;hall be at all ages, and in every &s;ituation of life. When you were learning to write, you know did not object to Mi&s;s Julia's giving you good copies, though you was well convinced it was totally out of your power to equal them."</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
"But, Ma'am," again returned Martha, "how can &s;uch a one as I imitate my Savi|our? Did not he come down from Heaven, on purpo&s;e to live and to die for the &s;ake of mankind? Now you know it is not in my power to do any &s;uch thing. I cannot rai&s;e dead per&s;ons to life, and heal the &s;ick, and give &s;ight to the blind, and make the lame walk. Be&s;ides, how can I go about to teach others, when I am &s;o ignorant, and &s;o much in need of in&s;truction my&s;elf."</P>
<P>"I well know," &s;aid Mrs. Bingham, "that neither you nor any of us can exactly perform the &s;ame actions as our Saviour did, I only meant that we &s;hould endevour to be guided by the &s;ame principle. What do you think prompted him to be &s;o won|derfully conde&s;cending, as to leave that glory of happine&s;s he enjoyed in Heaven, and to take our nature upon him, with all its wants and infirmities? Certainly nothing but an earne&s;t de&s;ire to do the will of his Heavenly Father, and to prove his love to man. By the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions our Saviour was actuated during his whole &s;tay on earth; and the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions &s;hould be cultivated by all his di&s;ciples."</P>
<P>"Very true, Madam," &s;aid Martha.</P>
<P>"From our Saviour," continued Mrs. Bingham, "we learn the duty of prayer. Sometimes he pa&s;&s;ed the whole night in de|votion. He never joined in a meal, but he
<PB N="5" REF="4">fir&s;t thanked God for the food he had pro|vided; and when he rai&s;ed Lazarus from the dead, he piou&s;ly expre&s;&s;ed his gratitude to his Heavenly Father, for enabling him to perform that wonderful miracle."</P>
<P>"O yes, Ma'am," &s;aid Martha, "I re|member we often hear of his praying."</P>
<P>"Our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord too has taught us," proceeded Mrs. Bingham, "to bear provo|cation, and even to forgive the greate&s;t in|juries. Should we not be a&s;hamed of being put out of patience upon every trifling occa|&s;ion, when we &s;ee with what mildne&s;s the Son of God bore with the neglect and dull|ne&s;s of his di&s;ciples? How cordially, upon Peter's repentance, he forgave his denial, and how earne&s;tly he prayed for his mur|derers, while hanging on the cro&s;s, to which they had nailed him."</P>
<P>"Dear! I wonder I never thought of this before," &s;aid Martha. "Is there any other way, Ma'am, in which we may imi|tate our Saviour?"</P>
<P>"Yes, Martha, we may imitate his <HI>hu|mility.</HI> He cho&s;e to be born in an humble &s;tation, and aimed at no earthly riches or di&s;tinction. By conde&s;cending to wa&s;h the feet of his di&s;ciples, he proved to us, that we &s;hould never be above &s;tooping to the low|e&s;t offices for the good of others. The <HI>be|nevolence</HI> of Je&s;us, I ju&s;t now indeed recom|mended to your imitation. We cannot, it
<PB N="6" REF="5">is true, like him, work a miracle to &s;upply the wants of a multitude: but though we are placed in a low &s;tation, we may &s;ome|times have it in our power, from our own &s;canty meal, to &s;upply the hungry with a mouthful of bread. We cannot cure the &s;ick with &s;peaking a word; but we may by nur&s;ing them with tenderne&s;s, promote their recovery, or at lea&s;t admini&s;ter to their com|fort. In our own troubles, we learn <HI>re&s;ig|nation</HI> from our Saviour's example. In his agony, ju&s;t before his crucifixion, his only prayer to God was, that if he was willing, he would remove from him the di&s;tre&s;s he at that moment endured, but that, neverthe|le&s;s, God's will might be done. In the cruel treatment he afterwards met with, not a &s;in|gle complaint e&s;caped him. He &s;eemed to be more concerned for his country, his mo|ther, and his friends, than for his own &s;uf|ferings. In &s;hort, Martha, if you examine with attention the life of our Saviour, you will find that he has him&s;elf &s;et us the ex|ample of every virtue which he has com|manded us to practi&s;e."</P>
<P>Martha would have been glad that her mi&s;tre&s;s &s;hould have proceeded farther; but the bell rang, and Mrs. Bingham was obliged to join her family in the &s;upper parlour.</P>
<P>Martha was a pious, well di&s;po&s;ed young woman. She had never before con&s;idered, that one de&s;ign of our Saviour's abode on
<PB N="7" REF="6">earth, was "to &s;et us an example that we &s;hould follow his &s;teps;" but the moment it was &s;ugge&s;ted to her, &s;he rejoiced to think that it was in any degree in her power to imitate the Lord of Glory; and &s;he deter|mined to make it her endeavour in whatever &s;he engaged, to reflect how her Saviour would have acted in the &s;ame circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>In her prayers the next morning, &s;he did not fail to implore God to a&s;&s;i&s;t her to keep her good re&s;olutions, for &s;he well knew, that &s;he was frail and &s;inful, and that nothing but Almighty grace could enable her to make any improvement.</P>
<P>Sally Hague was a girl about thirteen years of age, whom Mrs. Bingham had taken into her family, partly out of compa&s;&s;ion to her parents, and partly from con&s;ideration to Martha, who having a great deal, both of hou&s;e-work and needle-work, to do, &s;he thought &s;tood in need of &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Martha was too good a woman to make a &s;lave of Sally, as is unhappily the practice of &s;ome &s;ervants who have girls under them, as it is called; but her natural di&s;po&s;ition was ha&s;ty, and Sally's extreme dulne&s;s often put her patience to the proof, and &s;he was apt to reprove her in a &s;harp tone of voice.</P>
<P>It was Sally's bu&s;ine&s;s to put the &s;tudy to rights again&s;t her ma&s;ter came down. Martha had &s;everal times &s;hewn her how to do it;
<PB N="8" REF="7">but on going into the room the morning af|ter the above mentioned conver&s;ation with her mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he found the books piled upon a wrong &s;helf, her chairs out of their proper places, the du&s;t left in a corner, and not a &s;park of fire to be &s;een.</P>
<P>"Why, you plaguy torment," &s;aid &s;he, in an angry manner, "what in the world have you been doing there two hours? I wi&s;h with all my heart my mi&s;tre&s;s had ne|ver hired you, for I'll be hanged if you do not make more work than you &s;ave. Now my ma&s;ter will be down in a few minutes, and nothing will be ready, and then a fine noi&s;e I &s;hall have in my ears I &s;uppo&s;e."&mdash; "I am very &s;orry," &s;aid Sally, with tears in her eyes. "But cannot I do any thing now?" "You do any thing," repeated Martha; "no, nothing but go about your bu&s;ine&s;s. You are always in my way, you awkward hu&s;&s;ey!"</P>
<P>Sally walked flowly and &s;orrowfully to the other end of the room, and Martha, who was banging about the tongs and poker with the utmo&s;t violence, blu&s;hed to think how &s;oon &s;he had broken her re&s;olution. She compared her abu&s;ive language to this poor girl, with the mild rebuke of our Lord to his di&s;ciples for their repeated drow&s;ine&s;s, at a time when he &s;tood in mo&s;t need of friend|ly con&s;olation. De&s;irous of imitating his example, &s;he determined to conquer her ill
<PB N="9" REF="8">humour, let it co&s;t her what it would; and calling Sally in a milder voice, &s;he &s;aid, "Come and let me &s;hew you how to light the fire. You &s;hould not cram the &s;tove with coals, and &s;catter the wood in &s;eparate places; that will never do. You &s;hould put the &s;ticks acro&s;s one another at the bottom in the front of the grate, then put the large cinders lightly over them, and a few round coals on the top, and afterwards, with a piece of lighted paper, you mu&s;t &s;et fire to the &s;ticks through the bottom bars: then it will burn up pre&s;ently. Come, do not cry, there's a good girl! You'll do better to|morrow." Ju&s;t as &s;he &s;aid the&s;e words, her ma&s;ter came into the room much earlier than u&s;ual; finding his books moved from their proper place, and his &s;tudy in confu&s;ion, he flew into a violent pa&s;&s;ion, and cur&s;ed and abu&s;ed Martha in the mo&s;t dreadful manner.</P>
<P>Martha did not attempt to vindicate her|&s;elf, by laying the blame upon Sally; for &s;he remembered that her Saviour, though load|ed with fal&s;e accu&s;ations, <HI>held his peace;</HI> yet, when Mr. Bingham had left the room, as &s;he brooded over the hard names by which he had called her, &s;he felt by no means in|clined to forgive him; and had an oppor|tunity at that moment occurred, &s;he could have liked to have revenged her&s;elf.</P>
<P>To overcome this vindictive frame of mind, which &s;he was con&s;cious was di&s;plea|&s;ing
<PB N="10" REF="9">to the Almighty, &s;he reflected on the affectionate lamentation of our Saviour over Jeru&s;alem, in which city he had been &s;o often ill treated. She thought too of his prayer for his murderers: <HI>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</HI> "Was this the way," &s;aid &s;he, "that the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us behaved to his enemies, and &s;hall not I pardon a few pa&s;&s;ionate words? Shall I not forgive him, whom upon repentance God will forgive, and for whom Chri&s;t died?" She prayed a moment for a better temper, and &s;he quitted the &s;tudy, which &s;he had now fini&s;hed, in a quiet and compo&s;ed frame of mind.</P>
<P>After breakfa&s;t, as &s;he was wiping away the crumbs, a large piece of bread fell into the a&s;hes. No matter, &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf it is but the bottom of a loaf, and we may as well begin upon a new one at luncheon. The words of her Saviour, <HI>Gather up the frag|ments that remain, that nothing be lo&s;t!</HI> co|curred to her memory, and &s;he picked up the bread immediately. She remembered that the&s;e words were &s;poken at a time when Je&s;us Chri&s;t had been proving that he had all nature at his command, by the wonderful &s;upply he had furni&s;hed. Perhaps, thought &s;he, when the broken pieces of bread and fi&s;h were &s;pread over the gra&s;s they did not look of much value, yet we are told they were &s;ufficient to fill twelve ba&s;kets. If all
<PB N="11" REF="10">the &s;craps of this large family were fairly eaten, how many pounds of victuals would it &s;ave in the cour&s;e of a year. It is po&s;&s;ible my Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s would then give &s;o much more to the poor; at lea&s;t, the money that buys the food is theirs, and we have no right to &s;quander it.</P>
<P>In the evening as the man and maids were &s;itting together, the yard bell rung. John &s;aid, it was not his place to an&s;wer the back bell. Sally was up &s;tairs, Betty and Ann, who were at work, accu&s;ed John of ill-nature, and declared they would not &s;tir if the people rang the bell till they broke it. Martha was beginning to make the &s;ame &s;illy declaration, but the ran to the gate on recollecting the words of our Saviour, that <HI>who&s;oever will be great among you &s;hall be your mini&s;ter;</HI> and <HI>who&s;oever of you will be the chiefe&s;t, &s;hall be &s;ervant of all: For even the Son of man came not to be mini&s;tered unto, but to mini&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>Martha, like the re&s;t of the world, loved her own ea&s;e and convenience; &s;he was fond of being treated with re&s;pect; &s;he could not bear to be thought lightly of, and was di&s;|po&s;ed to &s;tand up for her rights with who|ever &s;hould oppo&s;e them; yet when &s;he con|&s;idered the Redeemer of mankind conde|&s;cended to lay a&s;ide his glory for our &s;akes, and that in&s;tead of being born as a great prince, in which &s;ituation he might have had
<PB N="12" REF="11">thou&s;ands at his command, he took upon him the form of a poor man, and gave up all his time to the good of others, &s;he was a&s;hamed of her own pride and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s. Not a day pa&s;&s;ed but afforded &s;ome opportu|nities of &s;ubduing the&s;e bad di&s;po&s;itions, by the imitation of the glorious example &s;he had &s;et her&s;elf to follow. The attempt was for a long time attended with the greate&s;t diffi|culty, but her own endeavours, and divine grace, in the end, &s;o far &s;ucceeded, that it appeared natural to her in mo&s;t in&s;tances, ge|nerou&s;ly to prefer others to her&s;elf. Did a &s;mall piece of pudding, or a cu&s;tard or two come out of the parlour, Martha, in&s;tead of in&s;i&s;ting upon a right to a part, was willing to give up her &s;hare to the others. Were there any little perqui&s;ites re&s;pecting which it was difficult to decide to which of the &s;er|vants they properly belonged, Martha was the fir&s;t to wave her claim.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be thought, that by thus laying her&s;elf open to be impo&s;ed upon by others, &s;he mu&s;t have led a mi&s;erable life. But I will ven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ure to &s;ay, that the di&s;putes &s;he avoided, and the love and good will of her fellow &s;ervants, which &s;he effectually gained, more than compen&s;ated for the&s;e little &s;acrifices.</P>
<P>Once Martha de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ected Sally in an atroci|ous fal&s;ehood. T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> was a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of which &s;he her&s;elf had never been guilty, and of
<PB N="13" REF="12">which &s;he had greater horror than of almo&s;t any other.</P>
<P>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ified on finding the pains &s;he had fre|quently taken to in&s;truct her in her duty, had been attended with &s;o little &s;ucce&s;s, &s;he for &s;ome time gave her&s;elf no further trouble about her, and even indulged a growing aver&s;ion to the girl. One idea, however, of|ten pre&s;ented it&s;elf, and at la&s;t prompted her to redouble her diligence, to prevent Sally, if po&s;&s;ible, from falling into bad cour&s;es.</P>
<P>The Saviour of the world eat and drank with publicans and &s;inners. The wretches, whom all el&s;e beheld with &s;corn, by him were received with kindne&s;s, and directed in the way of everla&s;ting life. And would he, thought Martha, for one crime, have ca&s;t off poor ignorant Sally?</P>
<P>It was about two months from the time we introduced Martha to the acquaintance of our readers, when Mary Saunders, a young woman with whom &s;he was intimately acquainted, called to inform her that her Mi&s;tre&s;s was in want of an upper &s;ervant; and that &s;he was certain, if &s;he would engage to come immediately, &s;he might procure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he place; which &s;he &s;aid, was well worth hav|ing, as the wages were ten guineas, and the perqui&s;ites valuable. Martha he&s;itated. Mary would fain have per&s;uaded her to return home with her, and hire her&s;elf with Mrs.
<PB N="14" REF="13">Freeman immediately. This, however, &s;he would by no means con&s;ent to; but thank|ing her friend, promi&s;ed &s;he &s;hould have an an&s;wer the next morning.</P>
<P>The moment &s;he was gone, &s;he began to reflect very &s;eriou&s;ly on the propo&s;al &s;he had received. She could not think, without re|gret, of quitting Mrs. Bingham, with whom &s;he had lived from a child, and who had always treated her with the utmo&s;t kindne&s;s. To leave her &s;o &s;uddenly, and for &s;uch a rea&s;on, would appear both unhand&s;ome and ungrateful: and at this time in particular, as her mi&s;tre&s;s was under the nece&s;&s;ity of go|ing for &s;ome weeks into the country, and had &s;everal times told her, that &s;he entru&s;ted her aged and infirm mother to her care during her ab&s;ence. Yet was the temptation very great to enquire after a place, where the profits would be con&s;iderably greater than at pre&s;ent; her affections having long been engaged to a worthy young man, to whom &s;he was to be united, as &s;oon as their mutual &s;avings &s;hould be &s;ufficient to enable them to furni&s;h a couple of rooms, and purcha&s;e a few hou&s;ehold materials.</P>
<P>To fortify her mind to decline an al|luring advantage, &s;he flew to her u&s;ual re|&s;ource. She peru&s;ed, in the fourth chapter of St. Matthew, the account of our Sa|viour's
<PB N="15" REF="14">temptation. From our great igno|rance of the nature of evil &s;pirits, it is not ea&s;y thoroughly to comprehend the nature of this part of his mini&s;try; yet we may learn from it &s;ufficient to perceive that our Lord was, like us, expo&s;ed to temptation, and that he nobly re&s;i&s;ted it. This example was not lo&s;t upon the worthy Martha. "Whatever it may co&s;t me", &s;aid &s;he, "I am determined to do my duty. Je&s;us Chri&s;t delayed not a moment to an&s;wer the artful tempter. I will therefore &s;tep to Mary di|rectly, and tell her how I have made up my mind. To-morrow morning I may be weaker."</P>
<P>She accordingly, with her Mi&s;tre&s;s's leave, went to Mrs. Freeman's immediately, and not all the per&s;ua&s;ions of Mary Saunders, to whom &s;he was extremely partial, could pre|vail upon her to alter her determination.</P>
<P>Martha pa&s;&s;ed but a dull &s;ummer. Mrs. Daw&s;on, the old lady of whom &s;he had the care, was &s;o helple&s;s as to require con&s;tant attendance. Her &s;pirits were bad, and &s;he &s;uf|fered much pain, &s;o that &s;he wept and com|plained ince&s;&s;antly. Martha's youthful viva|city made her de&s;ire a more enlivening &s;cene, and her patience was often on the point of being exhau&s;ted; but the thought of the tenderne&s;s with which our Saviour heard
<PB N="16" REF="15">the complaints of the mi&s;erable objects among whom he pa&s;t his life, and the readine&s;s with which he relieved them, taught her to &s;ub|&s;titute pity for di&s;gu&s;t, and to endeavour, by every kind of attention, to alleviate the poor lady's &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>But it would be endle&s;s to recite all the in&s;tances in which Martha profited by &s;eri|ou&s;ly contemplating the &s;potle&s;s example of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Suffice it to &s;ay, that by this means &s;he became one of the be&s;t of Chri&s;|tians, and mo&s;t amiable of women. Far, however, from priding her&s;elf in her im|provement, the practice &s;he had adopted of continually comparing her actions with tho&s;e of her Saviour, made her more &s;en&s;ible of her deficiencies. Unable, after all her at|tempts, to equal her exalted model, &s;he felt that &s;he mu&s;t be indebted to his mediation, if her imperfect endeavours were accepted, and gloriou&s;ly rewarded by everla&s;ting life.</P>
<P>Though &s;he acted from no worldly view, yet her Heavenly Father graciou&s;ly thought fit to reward her even in this life. She had &s;oon rea&s;on to rejoice that &s;he had not fol|lowed the advice of Mary Saunders, as Mr. Freeman became a bankrupt, all his &s;ervants were &s;uddenly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and &s;everal received not the full wages due to them. Mrs. Daw|&s;on,
<PB N="17" REF="16">at her death, left her a legacy of twenty pounds, as a reward for her fidelity and at|tention; and &s;hortly after &s;he became po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of this &s;um, &s;he made the worthy youth happy who had long loved her, and e&s;teemed her virtues.</P>

<L>Becau&s;e the craving DRAM-SHOP takes</L>
<L>The children's daily bread.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It oft has robb'd the heedle&s;s youth</L>
<L>Of health and &s;en&s;es too,</L>
<L>And plung'd his never-dying &s;oul</L>
<L>In everla&s;ting Woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come, neighbour, take a walk with me,</L>
<L>Thro' many a Dublin &s;treet,</L>
<L>And &s;ee the cau&s;e of penury</L>
<L>In hundreds we &s;hall meet.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We &s;hall not need to travel far&mdash;</L>
<L>Behold that great man's door;</L>
<L>He well di&s;cerns that idle crew,</L>
<L>From the de&s;erving poor.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="20" REF="19">
<L>He will relieve with liberal hand</L>
<L>The child of boned Thrift;</L>
<L>But where long &s;cores at DRAM-SHOPS &s;tand</L>
<L>He will with-hold his gift.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Behold that &s;hivering female there,</L>
<L>Who plies her woeful trade!</L>
<L>Tis WHISKEY, ten to one, you'll find,</L>
<L>That hopele&s;s wretch has made.</L>

<L>Lock down tho&s;e &s;teps, and view below</L>
<L>Yon cellar under ground;</L>
<L>There every want, and every Woe,</L>
<L>And every &s;in is found.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho&s;e little wretches trembling there,</L>
<L>With hunger and with cold,</L>
<L>Were, by their parents' love of drink,</L>
<L>To Sin and Mi&s;ery &s;old.</L>

<L>Who take tho&s;e wretches up,</L>
<L>Ere they have drank the bitter dregs</L>
<L>Of their &s;ad parents' cup.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Look thro' that pri&s;on's iron bars,</L>
<L>Look thro' that di&s;mal grate;</L>
<L>And learn what dire misfortune brought</L>
<L>So terrible a fate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Debtor and the Felon too,</L>
<L>Tho' differing in di&s;grace,</L>
<L>By WHISKEY you'll too often find,</L>
<L>Were brought to that &s;ad place.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="21" REF="20">
<L>Yet Heaven forbid I &s;hould confound</L>
<L>Calamity with guilt!</L>
<L>Or name the Debtor's le&s;&s;er fault,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>See the pale Manufacturer there,</L>
<L>How lank and lean he lies!</L>
<L>How haggard is his &s;ickly cheek!</L>
<L>How dim his hollow eyes!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He plied the loom with good &s;ucce&s;s,</L>
<L>His wages <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> were high;</L>
<L>Twice what the village lab'rer gains,</L>

<L>No book-debts kept from him his ca&s;h,</L>
<L>All paid as &s;oon as due;</L>
<L>His wages on the Saturday</L>

</LG>

<L>All to the DRAM-SHOP went.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See that Apprentice, young in years,</L>
<L>But hackney'd long in vice,</L>
<L>What made him rob his ma&s;ter's till?</L>
<L>Ah! WHISKEY did entice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="22" REF="21">
<L>That &s;erving man&mdash;I knew him once,</L>
<L>So jaunty, &s;pruce and &s;mart!</L>
<L>Why did he &s;teal and pawn the plate?</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Turn now thine eye where Channel-row</L>
<L>Di&s;plays yon man&s;ion drear,</L>
<L>And a&s;k each pale and &s;hiv'ring wretch,</L>
<L>What mi&s;ery drove him there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O! woeful &s;ight, &s;ay what could cau&s;e</L>
<L>Such poverty and &s;hame?</L>
<L>Hark! hear his words, he owns the cau&s;e&mdash;</L>
<L>It all from WHISKEY came.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And when the future Lot is fix'd,</L>
<L>Of darkne&s;s, fire, and chains,</L>
<L>How can the Drunkard hope to '&s;cape</L>
<L>Tho&s;e everla&s;ting pains?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Since all his claim to heaven he &s;ells,</L>
<L>And drink the be&s;tial cau&s;e,</L>
<L>Rejects the price his Saviour paid,</L>
<L>And di&s;obeys his laws.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For if the Murd'rer's doom'd to woe,</L>
<L>As holy writ declares,</L>
<L>The Drunkard with SELF-Murderers</L>
<L>That dreadful portion &s;hares.</L>
