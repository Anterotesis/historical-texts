<HEAD>Hi&s;tory of Mary Wood, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Heartwell, the worthy clergyman of a coun|try pari&s;h, was &s;itting in the porch of his little par&s;onage, when he &s;aw a figure rather flying than running down a hill near his hou&s;e, the &s;wiftne&s;s of who&s;e motion made it hard to di&s;cern <HI>what</HI> &s;he was, much le&s;s could he gue&s;s <HI>who</HI> &s;he was. She fled directly towards him, and &s;lung her&s;elf at his feet almo&s;t breathle&s;s with difficulty &s;he pro|nounced the words, "O &s;ir, &s;ave me! for pity's &s;ake hide me in your hou&s;e&mdash;they will be here in a moment&mdash;hide me this in&s;tant!&mdash;indeed I am in|nocent!" then without waiting for his an&s;wer file jumped up and ru&s;hed by him into the hou&s;e, the good man ran after her, and catching her hand led her up &s;tairs into his bed-room, and putting her into a clo&s;et within it, told her, no one &s;hould come there to hurt her. Then hearing a noi&s;e he looked out of his window and &s;aw &s;everal men and women running almo&s;t as fa&s;t as the young woman had before, and his maid Bridget (who had &s;een them &s;ooner from her own window) running to
<PB N="4" REF="3">
meet them, and to a&s;k what was the matter. He had forgotten to bid her be &s;ilent about the young woman, indeed he did not know that &s;he had &s;een her; but the truth is, &s;he was amu&s;ing her&s;elf in a very idle manner, with looking at the road out of her garret window, and had &s;een with great &s;ur|pri&s;e the wild behaviour of the poor girl, which rai&s;ed her curio&s;ity. This &s;he now hoped to &s;atisfy by &s;topping the po&s;&s;e that was running by; in&s;tead of an&s;wering her que&s;tions, they a&s;ked if &s;he had &s;een a girl about &s;eventeen, that was running from ju&s;tice pa&s;s that way. "What in a linen gown and green petticoat," &s;aid &s;he? "without a bonnet, and her hair and her cap flying?" "the &s;ame, the &s;ame," they cried; "which way did &s;he go?" "Why, what do you want to do with her," &s;ays Bridget; "for I &s;hould be loth to betray the poor thing to any harm." "Why, you would not conceal a thief," would you? &s;aid they. "She is a thief and has robbed her ma&s;ter." Nay if &s;he be a thief, &s;he may rob <HI>my</HI> ma&s;ter too," &s;ays Bridget, "for &s;he is gone up &s;tairs with him." Upon this they all turned towards the hou&s;e, and were coming in when Mr. Heartwell met them. He heard the la&s;t words, and was not a little di&s;turbed at the idea of having the girl found in his hou&s;e, for as &s;he knelt at his feet he thought he knew her face, and had by degrees recollected that, though much grown &s;ince he &s;aw her, he mu&s;t certainly be the daugh|ter of Matthew Wood, an hone&s;t labourer, who had lived &s;ome years in his pari&s;h, and died there three or four years before. The long illne&s;s before his death had reduced his wife to &s;uch poverty, that &s;he and her child world have peri&s;hed had
<PB N="5" REF="4">
not the good Vicar's charity helped out the &s;canti|ne&s;s of the pari&s;h relief. Mr. Heartwell, after hav|ing buried the poor man, tried to find a place for the girl and &s;ome help for her mother, who being in years, and her health much injured by fa|tigue and grief, in nur&s;ing and lo&s;ing her hu&s;band, was quite unable to work. By applying to Lady Worthy, who&s;e &s;eat was a few miles di&s;tant, he had the good fortune to get her into one of the alms-hou&s;es which that good lady had built and endowed; here &s;he was comfortably &s;upported, and her daugh|ter permitted to be with her 'till &s;he could find a &s;er|vice. As by the&s;e means Goody Wood and her daughter were placed at a di&s;tance from him, Mr. Heartwell had not &s;ince &s;een them; but was &s;atisfied that under Lady Worthy's protection they would be taken care of.</P>
<P>The people who were now ru&s;hing into Mr. Heartwell's hou&s;e, &s;topped on &s;eeing him, and on his a&s;king what they wanted there, one of the mo&s;t decent looking men &s;tepped forward and pu&s;hing the re&s;t a little back, &s;aid, "I ax pardon &s;ir for our bouldne&s;s in coming into your Wor&s;hip's hou&s;e, but we have got a warrant here for a young per&s;on that we be tould ran in here." "A warrant" &s;aid Mr. H&mdash;, "Why what, is the matter? What has &s;he done?"&mdash;"Plea&s;e your Wor&s;hip &s;he's a thief and has robbed her ma&s;ter's hou&s;e. We have had &s;ad doings at our village&mdash;Squire Banks's hou&s;e has been robbed too by his gardener and dairy maid, and they are both gone off. This poor girl, I &s;uppo&s;e, learnt their wicked ways (for &s;he would keep company with them) and the &s;ame
<PB N="6" REF="5">
night that they made off, it is thought that &s;he let them into Farmer Boucher's hou&s;e; and in the morning as &s;ure as can be, he found his bureau broke open and his money gone." "But what proof is there that this girl was concerned in the robbery, or that &s;he let in the robbers?" "Why, &s;ir, &s;he had been telling a mort of lies about them and that made them &s;u&s;pect her. So they &s;earched her box, and as &s;ure as can be, there they found &s;ealed up in a paper, &s;ix silver tea-&s;poons of the farmer's, with an E and a B upon them as his are marked with. She perte&s;ted they were none of his'n, but were given by a friend to keep for her, but alack a day! there is no believing a word that comes out of her mouth; &s;o nobody minded her; and when we ax'd her who this friend was that gave them to her to keep, &s;he was all as red as fire and would not &s;peak. So the farmer left us to take care of her whil&s;t he went to Ju&s;tice Gall|way's for a warrant. We had &s;hut her up &s;afe as we thought in a chamber, whil&s;t we ate a bit of din|ner and drank a little of neighbour Boucher's ale, but when he came back and we went thither to take her, lo and behold &s;he was not to be found. The window was open, and as it was not very high from the ground, we gue&s;s &s;he let her&s;elf down from it. We now &s;et off in pur&s;uit of her, all but the farmer, who, being pretty fat and pur&s;y, was not for running a race&mdash;So he gave us the war|rant, and a boy telling us as how &s;he took this way, we ran 'till we &s;aw a woman running, about half a mile before us, but afterwards we lo&s;t &s;ight of her; and plea&s;e your Wor&s;hip, your maid tells us as how &s;he made into this wery hou&s;e."&mdash;"It is true,"
<PB N="7" REF="6">
&s;aid Mr. Heartwell, "that &s;he is in my hou&s;e, and if you will con&s;ent to let her remain here a day or two, I will be an&s;werable for her appearance when called upon. In the mean time I will endeavour to find out the truth; for it would be a &s;ad thing to ruin &s;uch a young creature, by hurrying her to pri&s;on before we were &s;ure of her guilt. Farmer Bou|cher is an hone&s;t humane man, he knows my cha|racter, and I dare &s;ay will oblige me by &s;topping all further proceedings again&s;t Mary Wood, and leaving her in my care 'till I can talk to her and bring her to declare the truth." "That is what &s;he is not much u&s;ed to, I am afraid, &s;ir," &s;aid the man, "how&s;omdever, I will tell neighbour Bou|cher what your Wor&s;hip &s;ays, and you will be plea&s;ed to take care that &s;he does not get out of the window." "Boucher's wife is living, is &s;he not? (&s;aid Mr. Heartwell) what does &s;he &s;ay of the girl? &s;he mu&s;t know more of her character than her ma&s;ter can." "Yes, yes! &s;he be living and looking, and a good kind of body &s;he is, but at pre&s;ent &s;he is from home and knows nothing of all this bu&s;tle; for &s;he went two days ago to vi&s;it her father at Stoke. She is expectd home to-night, and then your Wor&s;hip may have the &s;peech of her if you like."&mdash;They then pulled off their hats and civilly turned back to their vil|lage. Mr. Heartwell immediately went up to his pri&s;oner, whom he found &s;unk on the ground in his clo&s;et and half dead with terror; for &s;he had heard a good deal of what had pa&s;&s;ed, and feared every moment that Mr. Heartwell would give her up to be dragged to pri&s;on. She knew &s;he had been detected in &s;ome fal&s;ehoods, that would make
<PB N="8" REF="7">
again&s;t her; and though &s;he was not guilty of the robbery, &s;he had enough to reproach her&s;elf with to take from her all the comfort and confidence of innocence; &s;he had therefore nothing le&s;s than the terrors of hanging, or being &s;ent to Botany Bay before her eyes.</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t now go back and tell by what deceit poor Mary was fir&s;t brought into trouble.</P>
<P>When fir&s;t Lady Worthy took her up, &s;he got her a place at Mrs. Trueby's, a widow lady of great piety and worth, who lived in the neigh|bouring town. She had a boy about &s;ix years old, her two maids were growing old in her &s;er|vice; &s;he took this girl to help them. The next day after &s;he came, &s;he bid her own maid &s;hew her how to &s;weep and du&s;t the be&s;t parlour. The maid, after &s;hewing her what &s;he was to do, and giving her a great charge not to touch the pier gla&s;s which &s;he her&s;elf would clean, gave her a long broom and left her to her &s;weeping. The little boy, who had not &s;een any thing &s;o young and live|ly in the hou&s;e, took a great fancy to Mary, who was no le&s;s fond of him, he &s;taid in the room to &s;ee her &s;weep it, and &s;he to amu&s;e him at the &s;ame time gave him an account of the wonders &s;he had &s;een performed in the &s;treet the day before, by a balance ma&s;ter, who poized a long pole on the palm of his hand and even upon his no&s;e, with other performances which, though not very won|derful in their kind, appeared &s;o to her, who had never &s;een any thing like it. To make little Edward comprehend what &s;he meant by this balancing,
<PB N="9" REF="8">
&s;he attempted to poize the long broom, &s;etting the &s;mall end on the palm of her hand, but not &s;ucceeding it fell on one &s;ide and unfortunately &s;truck the pier gla&s;s and broke it. Poor Mary cried out &s;he was undone, and begged Edward, if he had any pity, not to &s;ay &s;he did it. "Who then?" &s;aid he, "you will not &s;ay it was I?" "No indeed," &s;aid &s;he, "I will not lay it upon any body; only do not you contradict what I &s;hall &s;ay." By this time Mrs. Trueby, who heard the &s;ma&s;h of the gla&s;s, had ha&s;tened down &s;tairs and came into the room. "What gla&s;s did I hear crack?" &s;aid &s;he&mdash;"O Mary! my precious pier gla&s;s, the be&s;t piece of furniture in my hou&s;e, and a pre&s;ent from a dear friend who is now no more, quite &s;poilt! I valued it above ten times it's price! Is this your awkwardne&s;s, Mary?" Poor Mary &s;tood pale and trembling; but an&s;wered, "No indeed, madam." "Who did it then," &s;aid &s;he, rai&s;ing her voice? "A great bird, madam, (I do not know whether it was a pigeon) flew in at the window. I tried to drive it out, and it da&s;hed again&s;t the gla&s;s with it's bill and cracked it as you &s;ee," Little Edward, who was a&s;toni&s;hed at her invention and a&s;&s;urance, looked amazed, &s;hrugged up his &s;houlders and could &s;carce help laughing; his mo|ther ob&s;erved it, and &s;o did Mary, who giving him a wink, &s;aid, "ma&s;ter Edward knows it to be true, for he &s;aw it as well as I."&mdash;"O fye, Mary," &s;aid the boy&mdash;" that's too much&mdash;I would not have told of you, but when you &s;ay I know it to be true, you make me a liar as well as your&s;elf; and my mamma &s;ays, if I tell lies God Almighty will
<PB N="10" REF="9">
not love me." "Wicked girl," &s;aid the lady, "would you teach my child to lie? pack up and begone out of my hou&s;e, and you Edward I charge you tell me the truth;" upon this the child related the fact, and added&mdash;pray mamma forgive her, it was in trying to divert <HI>me</HI> that &s;he came by the accident." "No my dear," &s;aid her mother, "I cannot forgive her, fooli&s;h and carele&s;s as it was, and grieved as I am for my favourite gla&s;s, I could have forgiven her my lo&s;s; and though I &s;poke ha&s;tily at fir&s;t, I &s;hould &s;oon have con&s;idered her awkwardne&s;s and pa&s;&s;ed it over, but a girl that can &s;o readily invent a lie, and try to draw <HI>you</HI> into it, I cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;uffer to &s;tay a day in my hou&s;e, if you learnt to tell lies it would break my heart. The good lady, however, fearing the girl might get into mi&s;chief, after much kind exhortation de|termined her&s;elf to carry her back to lady Worthy, a&s;&s;uring her that &s;he would not have parted with the girl on account of the accident, had it not been for the daring fal&s;ehood with which &s;he attempted to excu&s;e it. Lady Worthy, equally &s;hocked, &s;ent for Goody Wood, and told her what had been her daughter's behaviour; adding, that &s;he had put it out of <HI>her</HI> power to &s;erve her, for &s;he could never again venture to recommend her. The poor wornan was quite overcome with grief, and did not dare to attempt to excu&s;e Mary's faults, but took her home in an agony of &s;orrow, where the girl had the mortification to &s;ee that &s;he had not only ruined her&s;elf, but made her mother com|pletely mi&s;erable. And indeed the poor woman be|came &s;o ill, that &s;he began to fear that &s;he &s;hould be the cau&s;e of her death; this affected her very
<PB N="11" REF="10">
much, and for a time &s;he was truly penitent, and re&s;olved never again to &s;peak fal&s;ely; but &s;o &s;trong is cu&s;tom, and &s;o weak was the principle on which &s;he acted, in her mind, that when &s;he &s;aw her mother recover, &s;he &s;oon returned to her little tricks and fal&s;e excu&s;es. It was no wonder &s;he did not reform, for &s;he had no fear of offend|ing God. Nobody took any notice of her, and the burden of maintaining her fell heavy on her mo|ther and kept them both in extreme poverty. At length a gentlewoman who knew the &s;tory, and was concerned that &s;o young a creature &s;hould be ruined, was prevailed upon, as &s;he had no chil|dren, to &s;end for her. She a&s;ked the girl why &s;he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from Mrs. Trueby's? to which &s;he replied, "it was for breaking a pier-gla&s;s." "And was that the only rea&s;on of her turning you away &s;o &s;uddenly?" the girl looked &s;ullen, held down her head, and &s;aid, "I believe &s;o." "Go," &s;aid the lady, "you will not do for me. I &s;ee you are not cured of your vile fault, and I will not take one who&s;e word I can never depend on." So home went Mary with a heavy heart, and after trying to evade her mother's que&s;tions, was at la&s;t obliged to confe&s;s what had pa&s;&s;ed; this renewed all the grief of this poor parent, and Mary was again in di&s;grace, and again promi&s;ed to &s;peak truth for the future, but never begged of God for his grace. Mary grew tall and &s;trong, and was a well looking good humoured girl, lively, though kept down by poverty and di&s;grace. At la&s;t a farmer's wife, who lived about two miles from her mother's, took her as a &s;ervant, and was for &s;ome time well plea&s;ed
<PB N="12" REF="11">
with her. In the &s;ame village lived a gentleman who&s;e name was Banks, he was gone on a tour and left his gardener and dairy maid to take care of the hou&s;e; the&s;e &s;ervants, who made very free with their ma&s;ter's property in every way, u&s;ed to call in Mary when &s;he went by on an errand. The gar|dener gave her fruit, and the dairy maid treated her with cream and &s;ometimes a &s;yllabub. The&s;e calls required excu&s;es from her for &s;taying on her errands. One day that they &s;aw her pa&s;&s;ing by, they told her they were going in the evening to the fair, and a&s;ked her to go with them. She replied, &s;he was &s;ure &s;he could not get leave to go that evening for they were going to fini&s;h their great wa&s;h&mdash;"pooh! pooh!" &s;aid they, "you <HI>mu&s;t</HI> go&mdash;'tis the la&s;t day of the fair, and there is a tall woman and a dwarf, and I know not what to be &s;een." Mary's curio&s;ity was &s;trongly tempted, and &s;he &s;aid &s;he would try what &s;he could do. So &s;he went to her mi&s;tre&s;s and told her &s;he had a me&s;&s;age from her mother to let her know &s;he was very ill, and begged &s;he would, if po&s;&s;ible, get leave to come to her. Mrs. Boucher (her mi&s;tre&s;s) was very good-natured, and &s;aid &s;he was loth to keep her from her mother on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, but did not know how to &s;pare her, they were &s;o very bu&s;y. Mary &s;aid, "if &s;he would be kind enough to let her go at five o'clock &s;he would work very hard till then," and to this her mi&s;tre&s;s con&s;ented. Be|fore that hour Mary run up to her garret, dre&s;t her&s;elf in a minute, and flew to Mr. Banks's time enough to join her friends &s;etting out for the fair. When they had been gone about an hour, her mother, who unluckily had &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s that way.
<PB N="13" REF="12">
called to a&s;k her daughter how &s;he did; the mi&s;|tre&s;s, who her&s;elf let her in, was amazed to &s;ee her, and the poor woman was thunder&s;truck when &s;he heard that the girl had pretended &s;he was ill and had &s;ent for her&mdash;and greatly alarmed to think where &s;he could be gone. She went about the village inquiring for her, and at la&s;t met a coun|tryman &s;he knew, who told her &s;he need not fear any harm, for he was ju&s;t come from the fair, where he &s;aw her daughter with a man and woman at a booth choo&s;ing ribbons; this did not comfort the mother, who went back to implore the cle|mency of Mrs. Boucher towards her imprudent child. Moved by her tears, and con&s;idering the force of curio&s;ity and vanity in a girl of &s;eventeen, &s;he at la&s;t promi&s;ed not to turn her away if &s;he made proper &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, but to try her a little longer.</P>
<P>As Mary was coming home in the evening &s;he met one who told her what a &s;earch her mother had been making for her, this threw her into a terror that &s;poilt all the plea&s;ure &s;he had enjoyed at the fair. She came home half dead with fear and fa|tigue, and threw her&s;elf at the feet of her mi&s;tre&s;s, confe&s;&s;ing her fault and making &s;olemn promi&s;es never to repeat it; after &s;evere reprimands, her mi&s;tre&s;s at length forgave her, on condition that &s;he &s;hould never again hold any acquaintance with that gardener and dairy maid, of whom &s;he told her &s;he had heard a bad character: Mary wept and promi&s;ed every thing; and though the cream and the fruit were &s;trong allurements, added to the civil things the gardener u&s;ed to &s;ay to her, yet
<PB N="14" REF="13">
for &s;ome time &s;he forbore her vi&s;its at Mr. Banks's; but by degrees the acquaintance was &s;ecretly re|newed, which co&s;t Mary a fal&s;ehood every time &s;he was with the&s;e people, who&s;e company her mi&s;tre&s;s had &s;o po&s;itively forbidden. One day Mrs. Boucher went to pay a vi&s;it of two or three days at her father's, a few miles off. The farmer could not go with her, for he was bu&s;y &s;elling his grain and getting his rent ready for his landlord; and had got the money in the hou&s;e on the Saturday which he meant to pay away on the Monday.</P>
<P>On Sunday after church he went out; charg|ing Mary to &s;tay at home and be careful of the hou&s;e: her two friends from Mr. Banks's took the opportunity of her being alone to come and drink tea with her; they had got notice of the Farmer's having &s;old his grain, and as they intended to rob their ma&s;ter's hou&s;e and go off with the &s;poil the next night, the gardener thought he might as well take the farmer's money with him; he remembered he had once bought &s;ome dung for his garden of him and &s;aw him put the money in a bureau in a little parlour.</P>
<P>While Mary was getting tea the gardener pu&s;hed open the parlour door, and &s;aid, "O here is a clever little cool room, let us remove the things in here." When they had got into that room he &s;aw the bu|reau, con&s;idered the lock, and then looking out at the window he took occa&s;ion, unob&s;erved by Mary, to examine the fa&s;tenings and how he could ea&s;ily get in at night. Whil&s;t he was thus employ|ed, one of the farmer's ploughboys pa&s;&s;ing by ob|&s;erved
<PB N="15" REF="14">
this man looking out of his ma&s;ter's window; he wondered at it, becau&s;e he knew the farmer was not at home.</P>
<P>Mary took care to di&s;mi&s;s her gue&s;ts before her ma&s;ter's return; and on his a&s;king her if any one had been there &s;he replied <HI>nobody.</HI> The next morn|ing when Boucher came down into the little room, he &s;aw his bureau broken open, and the ca&s;h that had been in it taken away.</P>
<P>The farmer inquired of all his people, and the ploughboy mentioned his having &s;een Mr. Banks's gardener looking out of the window, and &s;aid he had heard that the two &s;ervants were gone off that morning, and had robbed Mr. Banks's hou&s;e of plate and whatever they could carry off. This, compared with what the ploughboy had ob&s;erved, and with Mary's having denied that any body had been there, fixed their &s;u&s;picion on her as having been concerned in the robbery. She was forced to confe&s;s that Mr. Banks's &s;ervants were with her in the afternoon to tea, but &s;trongly denied know|ing any thing of the robbery, however they opened her box, there they found &s;ix new &s;ilver tea-&s;poons marked with the fir&s;t letters of Boucher's name, &s;ealed up in a paper. The farmer knew his wife had &s;ix new ones from London not long before, and doubted not the&s;e were the &s;ame. The girl's guilt now appeard plain.</P>

knew all that we have related of this unhappy girl, he &s;aw that appearances were &s;trong again&s;t her. Yet he was very unwilling to believe the wor&s;t, and immediately rai&s;ed her with kindne&s;s from the ground. "Mary," &s;aid he, "if you will now be perfectly &s;incere with me I will befriend you as much as juctice will permit. I find the chief cau&s;e of your being &s;o &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected is, that you have departed from the truth, this is always at|tended with great danger as well as guilt; you have been enough in&s;tructed in religion to know that deceit is hateful to God, that he has denounced dreadful puni&s;hment for liars&mdash;even 'the lake that burneth with brim&s;tone and fire,' that, he has com|manded every one to put away lying, and to &s;peak the truth to his neighbour from his heart; that ly|ing lips are an abomination to the Lord, but truth is his delight. For my part, I pity your youth, and I wi&s;h to &s;ave and &s;erve you, but unle&s;s I can hope to cure you of this fault, I mu&s;t with a griev|ed heart give you up to your wretched fate, for it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to do you any good." Whil&s;t he &s;poke his eyes filled with tears, and poor Mary cried without cea&s;ing. She now tried to &s;peak, but her &s;obs prevented her, at le&s;t &s;he &s;aid, "I &s;ee, I &s;ee that I have undone my&s;elf, that even you who are &s;o good will never more believe me, but give me up to mi&s;ery and de&s;pair; I would now mo&s;t truly confe&s;s to you every thing, but you will not, you cannot believe me! and I &s;hall ju&s;tly &s;uffer for what I have not done, becau&s;e I have made my&s;elf unworthy of belief. O &s;ir, what can I do? Is there no place for repentance? no good chri&s;tian whp will try me once again?
<PB N="17" REF="16">
Will you not at lea&s;t hear me if you cannot believe me, whil&s;t I tell you of all my &s;ins, and the &s;ad di&s;graces they have brought upon me?" "I will hear you," &s;aid the good old man, "but if you now deceive me, or hide any thing from me, I will never more concern my&s;elf about you, but mu&s;t leave you to reap the bitter fruits of your ba&s;ene&s;s of heart." Mary now threw her&s;elf at his feet&mdash;ki&s;&s;ed his hands&mdash;and bathed them with her tears. "O &s;ir," &s;he &s;aid, "God knows I have no wi&s;h to deceive or to hide any thing from you, if I do, I con&s;ent that you &s;hall give me up for ever." She then told what we have before related. When &s;he came to the article of the tea-&s;poons, he de&s;ired her to explain who&s;e they were, and how &s;he came by them. She told him that on the Sunday evening when Mr. Banks's maid and gardener drank tea with her, the former on going away took her a&s;ide, and giving her a little parcel &s;ealed up, begged of her to put that in her box and keep it for her till &s;he &s;ent for it; the rea&s;on of this &s;he would tell her when they met again. She went away without giving Mary time to a&s;k another que&s;tion. She was confu&s;ed when a&s;ked about the &s;poons, becau&s;e &s;he thought &s;he &s;hould betray her friend, and becau&s;e &s;he was a&s;hamed to confe&s;s the intimacy &s;he had kept up with her, again&s;t her mi&s;tre&s;s's orders and her own promi&s;es. How the &s;poons came to be marked with Bouch|er's letters, E B &s;he could not imagine; for the woman's name who gave them to her was Sarah Fi&s;her.</P>
<P>Mr. Heartwell kept Mary that night, and took
<PB N="18" REF="17">
pains to impre&s;s on her a deep &s;en&s;e of her &s;in. Next day they had a vi&s;it from farmer Boucher. who told them that his wife on her return, examin|ed her drawer, and found the &s;poons &s;afe as &s;he had left them. They were marked with the &s;ame letters as tho&s;e found in Mary's box; and as the farmer had &s;carce looked at them &s;ince they came home, he did not ob&s;erve that the others were not exactly like them. As this was the only po&s;i|tive proof alledged again&s;t Mary, the farmer now promi&s;ed to give her no farther trouble; though he &s;till knew &s;he had entertained the robbers the day before, on this account he would by no means take her again into his hou&s;e, but paid her the little wages due to her, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her from his &s;er|vice. Mr. Heartwell, who was plea&s;ed to find her account &s;o far true, tried to per&s;uade the Bouchers to let her &s;tay with them a little while at lea&s;t, as a ju&s;tification of her character; but they were &s;o di&s;gu&s;ted with her having kept up the acquaintance with the&s;e bad people, in defiance of their orders and her own promi&s;es, that they could not think them&s;elves &s;afe with &s;uch a &s;ervant in the hou&s;e. And Mr. Heartwell, with all the compa&s;&s;ion he felt for her, could not venture to pre&s;s them nor to an&s;wer for her future conduct. However he promi&s;ed that if &s;he kept her pre&s;ent re&s;olutions, he would befriend her as much as he could. He put &s;ome proper books into her hands, and took her to her mother, whom they found almo&s;t di&s;tracted by the news which had reached her of her daugh|ter having been taken up for a robbery; the poor woman every day grew wor&s;e after this &s;hock, and &s;ome weeks after her wretched daughter received
<PB N="19" REF="18">
her dying forgivene&s;s, but could never forgive her|&s;elf for the angui&s;h &s;he had cau&s;ed her mother, which &s;he was per&s;uaded had ha&s;tened her end.</P>
<P>Poor Mary had another &s;orrow. In the village where &s;he had lived with farmer Boucher, was a creditable Baker, his &s;on Thomas was bred up to the bu&s;ine&s;s, and was a very hone&s;t, &s;ober; agree|able young man. He had often be&s;towed kind looks and kind words on Mary, but had not ven|tured to make her an offer, as he thought his father would never con&s;ent to his marrying &s;o poor a girl. She, on her &s;ide, liked him well enough to wi&s;h he would &s;peak out. A little before the un|fortunate affair at Boucher's, the old baker died, his &s;on &s;ucceeded to his &s;hop and all his property, and was well e&s;teemed. Whil&s;t poor Mary was nur&s;ing her dying mother, this young man had oc|ca&s;ion to call at Mr. Heartwell's, who overheard him in talk with his maid Bridget about Mary, and lament the &s;ad di&s;grace that had befallen her, he added, "I am &s;ure it has been a great concern to me, for I own I liked the young woman; and now that I am my own ma&s;ter &s;hould have tried to ob|tain her for my wife, had &s;he pre&s;erved a better character." Bridget put in a good word for her, and a&s;&s;ured him that her ma&s;ter believed her en|tirely innocent of the robbery; to this he replied, "whether &s;he had any knowledge of the wicked intentions of tho&s;e vile &s;ervants nobody can know, but thus much has been clearly proved, that &s;he denied the truth of their having been with her, and had broke her &s;olemn promi&s;es to her mi&s;tre&s;s, by keeping them company for &s;ome time, there|fore
<PB N="20" REF="19">
&s;he is no wife for me. I could not be happy unle&s;s I could make a friend of my wife and de|pend on her truth and faithfulne&s;s, Her pretty face and good-humour would be nothing to me, without truth and hone&s;ty. Next to a good con|&s;cience the be&s;t thing is a good character. I ble&s;s God I have never forfeited my own, nor will I ever marry a woman that has lo&s;t her's." Mr. Heart|well was much plea&s;ed with the young baker's way of thinking, and very &s;orry that Mary had lo&s;t &s;uch a hu&s;band. As his chief concern was to complete the poor young creature's reformation, he thought nothing would make &s;o deep an im|pre&s;&s;ion on her mind as this mortifying con&s;equence of her ill behaviour: he re&s;olved on telling her all that the young man had &s;aid. He did &s;o; and &s;he took it &s;o much to heart that &s;he never after held up her head. Her mother's death, which hap|pened &s;oon after, left her without any earthly com|fort. What before was liking, was now changed into a &s;trong affection; &s;he &s;aw what a happy lot would have been her's had &s;he been as true and hone&s;t as the man &s;he liked. She lo&s;t all her &s;pirits, her mind was always full of bitter remor&s;e and &s;hame. She thought &s;he de&s;erved all the mi&s;ery &s;he felt, and only prayed that God would accept her &s;orrow for her &s;in. She made no complaints; but her looks &s;hewed that health as well as peace of mind had for&s;aken her.</P>
<P>Her mother's death obliged her to quit the alms hou&s;e, and &s;he then told Mr. Heartwell that &s;he was unable to bear the di&s;grace &s;he had brought upon her&s;elf in that neighbourhood, and was re|&s;olved
<PB N="21" REF="20">
to go and get bread in &s;ome di&s;tant country, where &s;he was not known. The good man, who felt like a father for every one of his flock, when in di&s;tre&s;s, tried to &s;ooth her and to per&s;uade her to &s;tay where &s;he was, and to look to her heavenly friend, but he could not prevail. She could not bear the thoughts of living near Thomas, whom &s;he had lo&s;t for ever. So the Vicar gave her what he could &s;pare to pay her journey and maintain her 'till &s;he could get an employment; he then gave her a letter to a clergyman who lived about fifty miles off, begging him to get her into &s;ome hone&s;t &s;ervice. She took leave of him with an almo&s;t broken heart, and grew &s;o ill and weak on her journey, that when &s;he carried her letter to the clergyman, he told her, &s;he appeared too ill for &s;ervice. In a few days &s;he grew a little better, told him &s;he thought &s;he could now get her bread if he would have the goodne&s;s to recommend her: that &s;he cared not how low the place or the wages were if &s;he could but be maintained, and would do all in her power to give &s;atisfaction. He &s;oon got her into a &s;ervice, hard labour &s;oon ha&s;tened on a decline which her &s;orows had begun, and &s;he &s;oon became &s;o ill that nothing better could be done for her than to place her in an ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t &s;he was there a letter from Mr. Heartwell informed her that her vile &s;educers were taken, tried, and executed. The &s;poons were claimed by Elizabeth Bearcro&s;t, Mr. Banks's hou&s;ekeeper. Sarah Fi&s;her had found them locked up in a cup|board after the re&s;t of the &s;tolen plate was packed up. She put them into her pocket as &s;he was go|ing
<PB N="22" REF="21">
to farmer Boucher's on the Sunday, but recol|lecting that perhaps the marks upon them might lead to her detection, in ca&s;e of misfortune, &s;he &s;uddenly took it into her head as &s;he was going away to leave them with Mary, as before related. Mr. Heartwell had taken the pains to vi&s;it the&s;e people in pri&s;on after their condemnation, and had got from the woman a confirmation of the poor girl's account. Mary langui&s;hed &s;everal weeks in the ho&s;pital, and meekly applied her whole mind to obtain the forgivene&s;s of God, through the merits of a Saviour.</P>
<P>The good clergyman a&s;&s;i&s;ted her in the great work of repentance, and pointed out to her the only true grounds on which &s;he could hope to ob|tain it.</P>
<P>Thus death brought on by grief and &s;hame at eighteen years of age, was the con&s;equence of bad company, fal&s;e promi&s;es, and FALSE EXCUSES.&mdash;May all who read this &s;tory, learn to walk in the &s;trait paths of truth. The way of duty is the way of &s;afety. But "the wicked fleeth when no man pur&s;ueth, while the righteous is bold as a lion."</P>
