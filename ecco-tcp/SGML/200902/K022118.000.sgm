<HEAD>TO WILLIAM STRAHAN, E&s;q.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE late Mr. David Hume hath left to your care, the publication of his po&s;thumous papers. As there is every rea|&s;on to believe they turn upon &s;imilar re&s;earches with &s;uch as
<PB N="ii" REF="4">
have been already printed; or, as it is more likely, they may carry his philo&s;ophy &s;till nearer to that point, which he might not think it di&s;creet to pu&s;h too vigorou&s;ly in his life-time, the critical and Chri&s;tian clamour, no doubt, will be rai&s;ed afre&s;h again&s;t him. It is well known, Sir, that you were con&s;idered by Mr. Hume, in a much higher light than that of a mere publi&s;her. There was, appa|rently, a mixture of tru&s;t and tenderne&s;s, as well as a good opinion of you, <HI>officially,</HI> blend|ed with the idea of his con|nection.
<PB N="iii" REF="5">
His memory, there|fore, and the honours or di&s;|graces which &s;hall hereafter at|tend it, mu&s;t, in a particular manner, intere&s;t and affect you. As he was your "mo&s;t <HI>excellent friend,"</HI> his friend&s;hip, and the virtues which produced it, are, I tru&s;t, "never to be forgot|ten."</P>
<P>Dr. Adam Smith hath &s;igned his name to a letter, at the clo&s;e of which, he thus con|ci&s;ely &s;ums up the character of Mr. Hume.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="6">
"I have always, con&s;idered him, both in his life-time and &s;ince his death, as approaching as nearly to the idea of a per|fectly wi&s;e and virtuous man, as perhaps the nature of human frailty will permit."</P>
<P>It has been long imagined, that, per&s;ons who were tinc|tured in any degree with that philo&s;ophy, which Mr. Hume was &s;uppo&s;ed to favour, could not po&s;&s;ibly have any title to &s;uch a character, as is here drawn by Dr. Smith. That
<PB N="v" REF="7">
gentleman, however, hath, with a commendable fortitude, a&s;|&s;erted, the virtues of his de|cea&s;ed friend.&mdash;The object of the following pages, is a con|firmation of that a&s;&s;ertion, as well as a philo&s;ophical plea for the ju&s;tice on which it is found|ed.</P>
<P>Three other views, however, are connected with the de&s;ign of this Apology. Some per|&s;onal knowledge of Mr. Hume; &s;ome expectation of the popular cen&s;ure, which, will &s;oon be revived again&s;t him, if not a|gain&s;t
<PB N="vi" REF="8">
his affectionate Dr. Smith, and a wi&s;h I have long entertained to have a fit oppor|tunity of introducing &s;uch &s;tric|tures on the mo&s;t atrocious &s;pe|cies of di&s;&s;imulation as will be found, in the cour&s;e of the work, are all arguments which have had a &s;hare in making it public.</P>
<P>My thoughts have, indeed, been thrown upon <HI>paper</HI> in ha&s;te; yet they are, by no means, ha&s;ty thoughts; but, have re&s;ulted from contemplat|ing the death of Mr. Hume,
<PB N="vii" REF="9">
&s;ome months before it actually happened.&mdash;In &s;hort, Sir, it is conceived, the&s;e remarks, upon the Life, Death, Con&s;i&s;tency, and Philo&s;ophy, of David Hume, may, very properly, precede any new edition of his works,&mdash;may, likewi&s;e, do &s;ome &s;ervice to the writer, and &s;ome to the man; place truth and the affectation of it, like the &s;un and its &s;hadow, in the wa|ter, &s;ide by &s;ide, in order to &s;hew the &s;plendour of one, and the mockery of the other.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="10">
As to your&s;elf, Sir, it would be an in&s;ult upon your feelings, not to &s;uppo&s;e every thing of this nature is acceptable.</P>

<HEAD>PRELIMINARY ADDRESS.</HEAD>
<P>READER, be not &s;tartled, at the title of this performance. It means no ill either to you or your religion, of whatever ca&s;t that religion may be. The Apology here offered to your in|&s;pection, that truth, or Chri&s;|tianity
<PB N="x" REF="12">
it&s;elf would not, of their own accord, admit. I be&s;eech you to peru&s;e the&s;e detached thoughts from the beginning to the end; and indulge the im|pul&s;es of the pau&s;er, rea&s;on, be|fore you determine upon any of the &s;ubjects here treated, with that liberality which be|comes the independent &s;pirit of &s;cientific enquiry, in a free &s;tate. An Apology, for the philo&s;ophy of the metaphy&s;ical Mr. Hume, appears to denote in this &s;u&s;|picious age, to be either ab|&s;tru&s;e, or difficult, or el&s;e dan|gerous,
<PB N="xi" REF="13">
and dei&s;tical. From this work, fear neither of the&s;e. It is written without profane|ne&s;s or irreverence. It promotes all morality flowing from all faiths, and it corrects all hy|pocri&s;y, wherever it is detected. The pro&s;titution of Chri&s;tianity, or, in other words, the Chri&s;tian religion made u&s;e of as a cloak to cover the mo&s;t irreligious purpo&s;es, is more fatal to the Su|preme Governor of the world, and to his &s;ubordinate creatures, than a much greater latitude of principle than was indulged by
<PB N="xii" REF="14">
Mr. Hume. Avowed Athei&s;m it&s;elf, is not half &s;o bad, as con|cealed deception, e&s;pecially when it takes refuge under the plau&s;|able and un&s;u&s;pected robe of Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ors. An ex|traordinary &s;omething, betwixt &s;uper&s;tition, and Popery pleads in favour of this wor&s;t &s;pecies of enormity; for which rea&s;on, it is le&s;s cha&s;ti&s;ed than any other. Common minds, which are ter|ribly trammeled by any &s;hallow &s;ignals of authority, are afraid of yielding to the &s;ugge&s;tions of their own under&s;tanding, and
<PB N="xiii" REF="15">
&s;o the evil is permitted, through mere vulgar cowardice, to ari&s;e, till the effects of the mi&s;chief be|come almo&s;t irreparable. Hence it is, al&s;o, that the truth of a whole library, were it clo&s;ely analyzed, and then con&s;olidated to the exclu&s;ion of every thing adventitious, and imaginary,&mdash;the whole amount of matter of fact, with re&s;pect to things im|portant, would be reduced to a few &s;canty volumes; or, at mo&s;t, &s;upply the &s;helves of a &s;mall book-ca&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="xiv" REF="16">
Having a due veneration for the rights of the pre&s;s, I have here, I hope, not unadvi&s;ed|ly, ventured to inve&s;tigate &s;ub|jects, or rather, to &s;tart hints, which a pu&s;ilanimity, very pre|judicial to candid enquiry, hath commonly pa&s;&s;ed over. I have &s;tarted matters, which it is to be wi&s;hed, were more philo&s;ophi|cally pur&s;ued by &s;ome able hand, and I am not without hope that what is here rudely &s;ketched, will be formed into a correcter &s;y&s;tem by a ma&s;terly writer.</P>
<P><PB N="xv" REF="17">
In the mean time, what is offered in the &s;ub&s;equent pages, however it may offend the zea|lots, will not be ill received by tho&s;e who are liberal and con|&s;i&s;tent.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I. OF HUME'S PHILOSOPHICAL CONSIST|ENCY.</HEAD>
<P>DAVID HUME is dead! Ne|ver were the pillars of Orthodoxy &s;o de&s;perately &s;haken, as they are now, by that event. It was attend|ed by every thing that contradicts the general prophecy concerning it. He hath proved him&s;elf, in oppo&s;i|tion
<PB N="2" REF="19">
to a contrary opinion, one of tho&s;e rare characters, which &s;o &s;el|dom adorn either this, or any other country; to wit, an <HI>uniform Philo|&s;opher.</HI> He is one of the few, who died in the practice of precepts, which he laid down in the earlie&s;t periods of a &s;peculative life. The la&s;t &s;cene is lately painted by him|&s;elf, and every touch of it corre&s;|ponds, corroborates, and confirms tho&s;e which preceded it. He took up the pen, to prove his con&s;i&s;t|ency, at a cri&s;is, commonly e&s;teem|ed by men, the mo&s;t alarming and pathetic. Air, phy&s;ic, exer|ci&s;e, and the alleviating &s;olicitudes of friend&s;hip, were all tried, and were all ineffectual: even adulati|on,
<PB N="3" REF="20">
which is &s;o &s;eldom unwelcome, either to the &s;ick, or healthy, was not able to &s;educe our philo&s;opher into the hope of an exi&s;tence pro|tracted beyond the limits of a few months.&mdash;"I happened to come in|to his room," &s;aid one of his mo&s;t re&s;pectable friends, "when he was reading a letter, &s;ent him by Colo|nel Edmond&s;tone, who had written an eternal adieu to him, and which, Mr. Hume immediately &s;hewed to me: I told him, that, though I was &s;en&s;ible how very much he was weakened, and that appearances, in many re&s;pects, were very bad, yet his chearfulne&s;s was &s;till &s;o great, the &s;pirit of life &s;eemed &s;till to be &s;o very &s;trong in him, that, I could
<PB N="4" REF="21">
not help entertaining &s;ome faint hopes. He an&s;wered, "Your hopes are groundle&s;s. An habitual diarr|hoea of more than a year's &s;tanding, would be a very bad di&s;ea&s;e at any age; at <HI>my</HI> age, it is a mortal one. When I lie down in the evening, I feel my&s;elf weaker, than when I ro&s;e in the morning; and when I ri&s;e in the morning, weaker than when I lay down in the evening. I am &s;en|&s;ible, be&s;ides, that &s;ome of my vital parts are affected, &s;o that I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> &s;oon die."</P>
<P>I have admitted this extract, be|cau&s;e it marks, in the mo&s;t vivid colours, the invariable, practical, con&s;i&s;tency of Hume to his own
<PB N="5" REF="22">
theory. Tho&s;e, to whom that the|ory is obnoxious, wi&s;hed, and ex|pected a very different deportment of its author in his la&s;t moments; the more e&s;pecially, if tho&s;e mo|ments were pa&s;t (which was the ca&s;e) under the declinings of a di&s;order that &s;hould wa&s;te the body, with|out impairing the mind. The per|&s;ons, who maintained oppo&s;ite, and what is e&s;teemed, correcter tenets, imagined, that all the &s;ubtlety of a &s;ceptici&s;m, avowed in the vi|gour of gay and glowing youth; and of arguments to &s;upport them, written when the pul&s;e was full, among the ardours of &s;cience, and for the &s;ake of &s;ingularity,
<PB N="6" REF="23">
would, upon the bed of a lingering di&s;temper, all fly off, as the pro&s;|pect of di&s;&s;olution became apparent, and leave their author in the agonies of terror-&s;truck repentance, or in the horrors of overwhelming de&s;pair. I, my&s;elf, know one per&s;on, in par|ticular, and he &s;till living, and not unknown in the Chri&s;tian world, who progno&s;ticated the mo&s;t tra|gical exit to David Hume,&mdash;"Take my word for it, &s;ir," &s;aid he, one day to me, "the triumph of that man, (meaning Hume) is &s;hort-lived. He breaks apace: from an almo&s;t athletic corpulency, he is, within a few months, &s;hrunk into the very &s;hadow of him&s;elf. I
<PB N="7" REF="24">
hear he &s;till affects his accu&s;tomed gaiety, and per&s;i&s;ts in his unchri&s;tian principles: but this conduct will wear away in proportion as he gets wor&s;e and wor&s;e. As Dean Swift &s;tands upon record the victim of di&s;appointment, pique, pride, ill-nature, &s;o, I fore&s;ee, will David Hume be a mournful example of that vain, and vicious philo&s;ophy, which he hath long had the audacity to e&s;pou&s;e. Methinks, I already &s;ee him, &s;ir, in the extremity; tortured at once, by the, la&s;hes of his con|&s;cience, and labouring to continue life, that he may publicly give the lie to his former horrible documents. Poor wretch&mdash;I pity him, I could almo&s;t wi&s;h his prayer granted,
<PB N="8" REF="25">
that he might do &s;ome ju&s;tice to po&s;terity; and, in that ju&s;tice, pro|pitiate the wrath, the omnipotent wrath, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be kindled again&s;t him. In&s;tead of which,&mdash;&s;hocking rever&s;e,&mdash;ob&s;erve him &s;truggling at the &s;ame time with death, and with a thorough con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having mi&s;guided man|kind; of having endeavoured to un|dermine the foundation of religion&mdash;and of meriting dete&s;tation."</P>
<P>In all the phrenzy of a fiery zeal, bordering, I fear, &s;omewhat upon bigotry, did a celebrated <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> author, as near as I can recollect, in the&s;e words, foretell the mi&s;eries of David Hume; and in the &s;ame fu|ror
<PB N="9" REF="26">
of language, hath he, doubtle&s;s, been treated, by many others. On the peru&s;al of that pamphlet, which &s;tates the accounts of his la&s;t illne&s;s, and all the concomitant circum|&s;tances that attended it, I &s;hould like much, as a matter of curio&s;ity only, to know the unaffected &s;tate of <HI>their</HI> feelings: their prophecy is, at all events, unfulfilled: and, what is wor&s;e, all the <HI>minute</HI> articles (which are generally the mo&s;t mark|ing) rather add to, than deduct from, the great aggregate of their con|&s;ternation.</P>
<P>In ju&s;tice to the memory of an extraordinary man, who hath, it is pre&s;umed, many &s;ecret and many
<PB N="10" REF="27">
public enemies, at lea&s;t in a literary and &s;cientific &s;en&s;e, it is worth while to take a view of &s;ome of tho&s;e points, which prove him, beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of a di&s;pute, to be at lea&s;t a <HI>&s;incere believer in his own &s;entiments.</HI> Many, indeed, will think, that this, however per&s;picuou&s;ly proved, will be doing him no real honour; &s;ince, in proportion to the clearne&s;s of the evidence upon this matter, it will only &s;hew his impiety and ob&s;tinate in&s;idelity the plainer; thereby, in the end, incurring upon him a more general di&s;grace. I am of a different opinion. The terms In|fidelity, Impiety, and Athei&s;in, &s;hould not be lavi&s;hly tru&s;ted from the lip. We &s;hould not pre&s;ume
<Q><PB N="11" REF="28">
To deal damnation through the land On each, we deem our foe:</Q></P>
<P>But, it is le&s;s the de&s;ign of the&s;e papers to <HI>defend</HI> Hume's principles, than to &s;hew, upon the be&s;t au|thority, that he was earne&s;t in what he wrote, and that, through every part of his life, even to the very moment of his death, he made precept and practice go, amicably, hand in hand together. Fir&s;t, how|ever, be it ob&s;erved, that, what|ever might be the force of his <HI>faith;</HI> no one, it is conjectured, will charge him with having neglected <HI>good works.</HI> I do not pretend to &s;ay how far tho&s;e <HI>are,</HI> or are
<PB N="12" REF="29">
<HI>not</HI> &s;ufficient. Such enquiries are digre&s;&s;ive from my &s;ubject. At the &s;ame time, I could wi&s;h (and &s;ure it is but a rea&s;onable reque&s;t) that, for the&s;e, he may have a proper <HI>de|gree of credit.</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps, it is one of the very wor&s;t circum&s;tances again&s;t the cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity, that, very few of its profe&s;&s;ors were ever, either &s;o mo|ral, &s;o humane, or could &s;o phi|lo&s;ophically govern their <HI>pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> as the &s;ceptical David Hume. The &s;imple dictates of this gen|tleman's own heart, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by tho&s;e examples, and &s;acred &s;enti|ments, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to in|&s;pire
<PB N="13" REF="30">
univer&s;al "love and good will among&s;t men," in&s;pired him to prac|ti&s;e all the duties, decencies, and cha|rities. Thus Hume the Unbeliever, as he hath been called, led a life that might even, when &s;crutinized by the eye of malevolence it&s;elf, call a blu&s;h into the cheeks of tho&s;e, who would fain be thought, in the ima|ginations of men, to be <HI>&s;teadfa&s;t and immoveable in the faith.</HI> It is not a little &s;hocking to thinking people, to perceive that the &s;pirit of hypocri&s;y &s;o generally gone forth; and it is &s;till wor&s;e, to &s;ee <HI>that</HI> hypocri&s;y (accord|ing to the a&s;&s;urance of a late lord) &s;o generally &s;ucce&s;sful and carry all before it.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="31">
It demands, alas! no &s;earch into the records of antiquity, to prove that, the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> world pro&s;ecutes this duplicity with a vigour, to which the &s;ceptic Hume never had the infamy to &s;toop. I do not &s;ay this is an argument to de&s;troy, or to invalidate the faith of Chri&s;tians; but I <HI>will</HI> take upon me to &s;ay, it is a dreadful &s;ymptom of an un|foundne&s;s in its profe&s;&s;ors, and friends, when they &s;o commonly &s;kulk behind the holy &s;hield of their religion, as a <HI>hiding place</HI> from the eyes of the world, whenever they have a mind to do any thing in di|rect oppo&s;ition to its mo&s;t obvious
<PB N="15" REF="32">
and elementary principles. Either the religion is &s;omewhere defective in it&s;elf, (which I, by no means, think &s;o likely as the alternative) or el&s;e the votaries them&s;elves have a much wor&s;e opinion of its <HI>real</HI> origin than &s;ceptics; becau&s;e, were not one of the&s;e, or perhaps, a mixture of them both, the <HI>fact,</HI> &s;urely they could not, &s;o much oftener than tho&s;e &s;ceptics, act in general defiance of its maxims. I, however, principally confine my&s;elf to that mi&s;erable hypocri&s;y, which hath &s;o very frequently been <HI>di&s;cover|ed</HI> among&s;t the votaries of this ami|able religion; and, in particular, &s;uch of them as have gained the
<PB N="16" REF="33">
greate&s;t popularity, by an oftentati|ous di&s;play of it. I beg the&s;e &s;en|timents may not be thought to have any tendency to hurt the Chri&s;tian religion, of who&s;e excellence I am not now to treat; yet, till &s;ome of its profe&s;&s;ors can, by the con|junction of <HI>faith and good works,</HI> back'd by the pro&s;pect of <HI>futurity,</HI> &s;urpa&s;s, or at lea&s;t equal, the virtues of a man who was tender, friendly, generous, and &s;ocial; let the&s;e vain glorious boa&s;ters have the mode&s;ty to hold their tongues, and &s;peak nothing; &s;ince nothing can be &s;poken, but to their di&s;grace.&mdash;It is to the honour of David Hume, then, that he was no <HI>hypocrite</HI> in philo&s;ophy; and that, unlike the
<PB N="17" REF="34">
many <HI>detected</HI> hypocrites in <HI>Chri&s;ti|anity,</HI> he acted as he wrote, and wrote no more than, at all times, he actually felt.</P>
<P>This may be evidenced more ac|curately, when we run our eye over that po&s;thumous paper, which he hath, very characteri&s;tically, called, <HI>A Funeral Oration.</HI> Prior to this, I would ju&s;t turn an old &s;ubject on a new &s;ide: I would make a com|ment or two, on that &s;hameful &s;pe|cies of delu&s;ion, which, arrayed in the fair and un&s;u&s;picious robes of or|thodoxy, makes the mo&s;t fatal de|predations upon &s;ociety; and, in|deed, does infinitely more mi&s;chief than the mo&s;t daring and declared infidelity.</P>

<P>ONE of the di&s;tingui&s;hing fea|tures, by which we mark the pre|&s;ent age, is religious Hypocri&s;y, or that abominable <HI>prudery</HI> in Sen|timent, which, from the lip out|wards, deceives the &s;hallow mul|titude, who mi&s;take it for the con|&s;cientious &s;cruples of moral &s;anctity.

Our modern morali&s;ts, e&s;pecially of the &s;acred order, have the art of making Virtue terrible, and Vice an object of indifference: like an un&s;kilful painter, they dis&s;igure the native amiablene&s;s of the one by certain rigid &s;trokes of the pencil too formidable to be &s;een with plea&s;ure; and they pourtray the marking fea|tures of the other, either &s;o loo&s;ely or ludicrou&s;ly, that, as we have no violent de&s;ire to po&s;&s;e&s;s the one, &s;o

&s;word, to de&s;troy the unhappy com|pound of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, which, they allow, he hath him&s;elf implanted; they talk of his having, propen&s;ely, hardened the heart of the &s;inner, as he did that of Pharoah, and yet that he rewards with plague and pe&s;tilence the creature whom he hath <HI>de&s;tined</HI> to di&s;obedience; they en|large much upon his tenderne&s;s, and yet ob&s;erve, in one and the &s;ame page, that the crimes of the father &s;hall be vi&s;ited on the children, even unto the fourth generation.

<PB N="25" REF="42">
qualities po&s;&s;ible, to an e&s;|&s;ence all pure, immutable, un|contradictory? The real character of the univer&s;al Parent is clouded, confu&s;ed, and enveloped, in the thick fog of human opinions and human inventions.

<P>How much happier would be the con&s;equence; how much more would it do honour to the Chri&s;tian cau&s;e, if divines and morali&s;ts were to inculcate, both in their public orations, and writings, that &s;pecies

of Morality, Sentiment, Philo&s;ophy or whatever el&s;e you plea&s;e to call it, which draws the portraits of Virtue with all po&s;&s;ible amiablene&s;s, which is finely coloured, which has recour&s;e both to Eloquence and Poetry, in order to attract, and entertain, rather than to affright and di&s;gu&s;t! Doubtle&s;s, more may be done by inviting than by in&s;i&s;ting, e&s;pecially in ca&s;es of duty and obe|dience, which are, in them&s;elves, I conceive, not very con&s;i&s;tent with the pride or the dignity of human nature: true it is, that, a &s;evere ma&s;ter may, by the power of that very &s;everity, create in a &s;ervant a kind of momentary veneration, but the very in&s;tant he is out of the pre|&s;ence

of his &s;uperior, he admits, of nece&s;&s;ity, a mixed &s;entiment of hatred and terror.

comfortableideas, and all their chear|ful a&s;&s;ociations, of fairer and more alluring; attributes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Hume hath, him&s;elf, noticed this contradiction: "Thus it may &s;afely be affirm|ed, that popular religions are really, in the conception of their more vulgar votaries, a &s;pecies of daemoni&s;m; and the higher the Deity is exalted in power and knowledge, the lower, of cour&s;e, is he depre&s;&s;ed in good|ne&s;s and benevolence; whatever epithets of prai&s;e may be be&s;towed on him by his amazed adorers. Among idolaters, the words may be fal&s;e, and belie the &s;ecret opinion: but among more exalted religion|i&s;ts, the opinion it&s;elf often contracts a kind of fal&s;ehood, and belies the inward &s;enti|ment. The heart &s;ecretly dete&s;ts &s;uch mea&s;ures of cruel and implacable ven|geance; but the judgment dares not but pronounce them perfect and adorable. And the additional mi&s;ery of this inward &s;trug|gle aggravates all the other terrors, by which the&s;e unhappy victims to &s;uper&s;tition are for ever haunted.
<P>Lucian ob&s;erves, that a young man, who reads the hi&s;tory of the gods in Homer or He&s;iod, and finds their factions, wars, in|ju&s;tice, ince&s;t, adultery, and other immo|ralities &s;o highly celebrated, is much &s;ur|prized afterwards, when he comes into the world, to ob&s;erve, that puni&s;hments are by law inflicted on the &s;ame actions, which he had been taught to a&s;cribe to &s;uperior be|ings. The contradiction is &s;till perhaps &s;tronger between the repre&s;entations given us by &s;ome latter religions and our natural ideas of genero&s;ity, lenity, impartiality, and ju&s;tice; and in proportion to the mul|tiplied terrors of the&s;e religions, the bar|barous conceptions of the divinity are mul|tiplied upon us. Nothing can pre&s;erve un|tainted the genuine principles of morals in our judgment of human conduct, but the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of the&s;e principles to the exi&s;tence of &s;ociety. If common conception can indulge princes in a &s;y&s;tem of ethics, &s;omewhat different from that which &s;hould regulate private per&s;ons, how much more tho&s;e &s;uperior beings, who&s;e attributes, views, and nature are &s;o totally unknown to us? <HI>Sunt &s;uperis &s;ua jura.</HI> The gods have maxims of ju&s;tice peculiar to them|&s;elves."</P>
<P>And again, in another place, with &s;till greater conci&s;ene&s;s: "How is the Deity di&s;|figured in our repre&s;entations of him! What caprice, ab&s;urdity, and immorality are at|tributed to him! How much is he degraded even below the character, which we &s;hould naturally, in common life, a&s;cribe to a man of &s;en&s;e and virtue!" <HI>Nat. Hi&s;t. Relig.</HI></P></NOTE>. This makes

even by tho&s;e, who profe&s;&s;ional|ly preach every Sunday upon the &s;ubject. The <HI>frowns</HI> of God may terrify into an <HI>extorted</HI> obedience,

as we may frighten a child, or a dome&s;tic, into the very fal&s;hood, for which we are at that moment chiding him. But this is, in effect, making God the cau&s;e of our hy|pocri&s;y.

the regular operations of the mate|rial &s;y&s;tem, but to the immediate di&s;plea&s;ure of the Deity.

<HEAD>SECTION III. ON THE NATURAL DIGNITY OF THE LITERARY CHARACTER, AND THE REASONS WHICH HAVE BROUGHT IT INTO CONTEMPT.</HEAD>
<P>LET us now advert to <HI>another</HI> &s;pecies of Hypocri&s;y, from which our Philo&s;opher was totally exempt; to which, indeed, his temper was perfectly &s;uperior. Among the in&s;tances of generous independency in David Hume, mu&s;t not be forgot|ten that manline&s;s, which prevent|ed him from wading through the
<PB N="43" REF="60">
the pro&s;tituted puddle of fawning DEDICATION. To this magnanimi|ty&mdash;to this firmne&s;s it was owing, that, his feelings were never di&s;|graced, nor his &s;pirit at any time weighed down by the burden of fa|vours, ignominiou&s;ly begged, and ungraciou&s;ly be&s;towed. Alexander, when he had won his world, had le&s;s rea&s;on to &s;ing forth the Io Pean of triumph, than had our author to gratulate him&s;elf on the &s;atisfaction of "never having preferred a re|que&s;t to one great man, or ever of having made advances to any of them." To confe&s;s the truth, he wrote, generally, upon &s;ubjects of which the modern nobility are, for the mo&s;t part, &s;o contemptibly ig|norant,
<PB N="44" REF="61">
that to have in&s;cribed per|formances &s;o &s;cientific to &s;uch pa|trons, would involve the Philo&s;o|pher in a &s;imilar error of judgment. Indeed, nothing is more offen&s;ive to men of true ta&s;te, and right feel|ing, than the <HI>conde&s;cen&s;ion</HI> of per|&s;ons of genius, to per&s;ons of rank, merely as &s;uch. This it is, more than any thing el&s;e, that hath help|ed to degrade the literary character; which, as it implies a &s;uperior vi|gour of intellect, and a more en|larged capacity, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, naturally, an unrivalled dignity. According to all the &s;y&s;tems of all the &s;ects, it is allowed that the <HI>human under&s;tand|ing</HI> is the greate&s;t, as it is the mo&s;t boa&s;ted, di&s;tinction of <HI>human beings;</HI>

<Q>MADAM, Among the many novelties with which your Lady&s;hip, a &s;tranger in our nation, is daily entertained, you have not yet been made acquainted with the poetical Engli&s;h liberty, the <HI>right of Dedication;</HI> which en|titles us to a <HI>priviledge,</HI> of celebrating what|ever, for its native excellence, is the <HI>ju&s;t</HI> ob|ject of prai&s;e; and is an ancient <HI>charter,</HI> by which the Mu&s;es have always a free acce&s;s to the habitation of the Graces</Q>

<P>I mo&s;t humbly beg permi&s;&s;ion to throw this trifle at your Lady&s;hip's feet: and deep|ly con&s;cious as I am of its unworthine&s;s&mdash;of its inacuracy, and of its incapacity to &s;tand before &s;o bright and penetrating an eye as your Lady&s;hip's&mdash;I &s;hould not pre|&s;ume even to hope pardon for my temerity, were I not con&s;oled by reflecting, that your ta&s;te, (infinite as it is,) meets a powerful com|petitor, in the immen&s;ity of your good-nature.

Go into We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey, and you will find, that what rai&s;es the admiration of the &s;pectator is not the Mau&s;oleums of the Engli&s;h kings, but the monuments, which the gratitude of the na|tion has erected to perpetuate the memory of tho&s;e illui&s;trious men who contributed to its glory. We view their &s;tatues in that Abbey in the &s;ame manner, as tho&s;e of Sophocles, Plato, and other immortal per|&s;onages, were viewed in Athens; and I am per&s;uaded, that the bare &s;ight of tho&s;e glo|rious monuments has fired more than one brea&s;t, and been the occa&s;ion of their be|coming great men. <BIBL><HI>Voltaire.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE> lu&s;tre of talents to the dullne&s;s of

titles, I &s;ay, if a &s;pirit of this kind were arou&s;ed, it would &s;oon re&s;tore to men of genius, the original rights of literature, at the &s;ame time that it would effectually cru&s;h that dar|ing in&s;olence, which is now common among a &s;et of people, who pique them&s;elves upon advantages which,
<PB N="65" REF="82">

<P>In&s;tead of this &s;pirited conduct, however, we have the misfortune to perceive a &s;tyle of ba&s;ene&s;s and adu|lation, creep through mo&s;t of the epi&s;tles dedicatory for the &s;pace of &s;everal centuries; by which means flattery and ful&s;omene&s;s is a&s;&s;ociated with the very idea of tho&s;e addre&s;&s;es, and the literary character is held, by the dulle&s;t of the &s;pecies, in ut|ter contempt.</P>

<P>If a production is fit for the eye of men of ta&s;te, it ought to be ac|ceptable to men of rank; who are

ready enough to be thought in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of a fine ta&s;te them&s;elves, and very frequently, no doubt, pay liberally, for their dedications, &s;ole|ly upon that principle.</P>
<P>If, on the other hand, a perform|ance is crude, trifling, ill-writ|ten, and, notwith&s;tanding &s;uch de|fects, is, without the con&s;ent of the Patron, adorned with a name which it di&s;graces, &s;uch patron ought pub|licly to renounce his protection, and treat the pretender, as every pre|tender of whatever profe&s;&s;ion de|&s;erves to be treated; &s;till, however, with this &s;alvo, that if the producti|on could have done any &s;ervice to literature, or promoted, but in a

&s;mall degree, the cau&s;e of &s;cience, he would have been the fir&s;t man to acknowledge <HI>his obligations,</HI> for hav|ing been thought a fit patron to a&s;|&s;i&s;t that cau&s;e, and &s;trengthen tho&s;e &s;ervices.&mdash;While the pre&s;ent &s;can|dalous conce&s;&s;ions remain, the &s;neer will inevitably be thrown upon &s;uch abominable pro&s;tration.

owes to a character, founded on qua|lities, which ought to be a better pa&s;&s;port to honorary di&s;tinctions, than any that can be conferred by royal grant, or by the pride of an|ce&s;try.</P>
<P>On &s;uch qualities was founded the reputation of David Hume, &s;o that upon <HI>this</HI> occa&s;ion, at lea&s;t, his ex|ample may be held up to per&s;ons en|gaged in literary pur&s;uits, as a pro|per &s;tandard.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IV. OF HUME'S PRINCIPLES, AND HIS MOTIVE FOR MAKING THEM PUB|LIC, WITH SOME REMARKS ON HIS CONDUCT IN HIS LAST MOMENTS.</HEAD>
<P>BUT to go on with the moral character of David Hume. Who|ever places the writings of this Philo&s;opher be&s;ide tho&s;e of many Chri&s;tian authors who have been much celebrated for them, will be able to judge without preju|dice. It is impo&s;&s;ible for the &s;en|timents of the elegant Tillot&s;on, or the orthodox Addi&s;on, to be more the champions of every part of
<PB N="72" REF="89">
conduct, which tends to the welfare of the &s;ocial world, than tho&s;e &s;en|timents which are to be collected from Hume&mdash;Nay, the mo&s;t ra|tional &s;pirit of morality, the mo&s;t likely of all others in the world, to affect this, breathes ardently through all his philo&s;ophy: elegance of ta&s;te, cha&s;tity of &s;entiment, delicacy of pa&s;&s;ion, decency of manners, love of truth, command of pa&s;&s;ion, cul|tivation of friend&s;hip, and the good order, and political pro&s;perity of the &s;tate, are every where recom|mended, Very few of our eminent writers on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the que&s;tion can &s;ay as much. But, with re&s;pect to Mr. Hume, every
<PB N="73" REF="90">
effort of his pen &s;tands in te&s;timony of it.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations cannot, never|thele&s;s, be called &s;ceptical. I do not, nor &s;hall I pre&s;ume to &s;ay, how far Hume's philo&s;ophy was right or erroneous in its <HI>principle.</HI> Suffi|cient for my purpo&s;e, if I can con|vince any reader (that might he&s;i|tate before) of his <HI>con&s;i&s;tency with him&s;elf:</HI> a point, which, is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to the cau&s;e of <HI>every</HI> &s;y&s;tem, be its purport, and its objects what they may.</P>
<P>The &s;cience pur&s;ued with &s;uch vigorous curio&s;ity by Hume was, to u&s;e his own expre&s;&s;ions, "to
<PB N="74" REF="91">
know the different operations of the mind, to &s;eparate them from each other, to cla&s;s them under their proper heads, and to correct all that &s;eeming di&s;order, in which they lie involved, when made the object of reflection and enquiry!"</P>
<P>It hath, generally, been thought that, our author carried this mental geography, as he calls it, too far into the realms of &s;ceptici&s;m, and into the ab&s;tru&s;e, bewildering de|&s;erts of unchearful metaphy&s;ics. Yet, however ardent he was in &s;pecula|tions of this ab&s;tract and difficult nature, no one will deny, that he drew the form of virtue, upon all occa&s;ions, as the mo&s;t lovely and
<PB N="75" REF="92">
e&s;timable of all objects. He firmly believed, that, in &s;ome very impor|tant re&s;pects, truth was overwhelm|ed in error and &s;uper&s;tition; he was, therefore, &s;ufficiently enter|prizing to try, if, by the aids of application, care, art, and di&s;cri|minating accuracy, he could not "unite the boundaries of the dif|ferent &s;pecies of philo&s;ophy, by re|conciling profound enquiry with clearne&s;s, and truth with novelty."</P>
<P>This, it is confe&s;&s;ed, was the la|bour of a long, healthy, and con|templative life: he per&s;i&s;ted in the pur&s;uit, in defiance of all oppo&s;ing fatigues, clamours, oppo&s;itions, neg|lects, oppre&s;&s;ions. It could not
<PB N="76" REF="93">
be the love of an e&s;tabli&s;hed literary &s;ame, that urged him to the pro&s;e|cution of &s;uch re&s;earches, becau&s;e he knew there was, in <HI>his</HI> &s;pecies of philo&s;ophy, an ab&s;tractedne&s;s, as well as a &s;uppo&s;ed &s;pirit of fallacy, which, could not, in the nature of things, and certain prevailing modes, become for many ages, either a po|pular, or a plea&s;ing &s;cience. It was, to all intents and purpo&s;es, "<HI>caviare</HI> to the multitude." Nay, he was well per&s;uaded of all this, not only by the odium which was ca&s;t upon his Treati&s;e on Human Na|ture, which "fell dead born from the pre&s;s," but al&s;o from the following pa&s;&s;age, which &s;hews how little hope he had of making the ab&s;tru&s;e phi|lo&s;ophy
<PB N="77" REF="94">
&s;o generally reli&s;hed as that which is more gay, elegant, and &s;u|perficial. "Nothing can be more u&s;eful," &s;ays he, "than compo&s;itions of the ea&s;y &s;tyle and manner, which draw not too much from, life, re|quire no deep application, to be comprehended: and &s;end back the &s;tudent among mankind, full of noble &s;entiments and wi&s;e precepts, applicable to every exigence of hu|man life. By means of &s;uch com|po&s;itions, virtue becomes amiable, &s;cience agreeable, company in&s;truc|tive, and refinement entertaining."</P>
<P>A Philo&s;opher of Hume's clo&s;e, and difficult rea&s;oning, who was hardy enough, to &s;crutinize &s;ubjects,
<PB N="78" REF="95">
imagined to puzzle more, as they are more inve&s;tigated&mdash;a man, who had either patience or for|titude enough to cultivate meta|phy&s;ical &s;cience, with a deter|mined view of overturning, and eradicating, root and branch, pre|judices which appeared <HI>to him</HI> at lea&s;t, to merit an analy&s;is which &s;hould prove their futility.&mdash;Such a man, could not expect the &s;ame eclat with the generality of mankind, as tho&s;e who only played prettily on the &s;urface of "a more ea&s;y and ob|vious philo&s;ophy." Hume content|ed him&s;elf with le&s;s general gratifi|cations. His own remarks very fully convince us what he felt, what he
<PB N="79" REF="96">
expected, and what he enjoyed on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Speaking of the common di&s;ta&s;te to which men have for &s;peculations that require <HI>thinking,</HI> to compre|hend them, he hath the&s;e &s;entiments in the fir&s;t &s;ection of his Enquiry concerning Human Under&s;tanding.</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>But may we not hope, that phi|lo&s;ophy, if cultivated with care, and encouraged by the attention of the public. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay carry its re&s;earches &s;till farther, and di&s;cover, at lea&s;t in &s;ome degree, the &s;ecret &s;prings and principles, by which the human mind is actuated in its operations? A&s;tronomers had long contented
<PB N="80" REF="97">
them&s;elves with proving, from the phaenomena, the true motions, or|der, and magnitude of the heavenly bodies: till a philo&s;opher, at la&s;t, aro&s;e, who &s;eems, from the hap|pie&s;t rea&s;oning, to have al&s;o deter|mined the laws and forces, by which the revolutions of the planets are governed and directed. The like has been performed with regard to other parts of nature. And there is no rea&s;on to de&s;pair of equal &s;uc|ce&s;s in our enquiries concerning the mental powers and oeconomy, if pro&s;ecuted wlth equal capacity and caution. It is probable, that one operation and principle of the mind depends on another; which, again, may be re&s;olved into one more ge|neral
<PB N="81" REF="98">
and univer&s;al: and how far the&s;e re&s;earches may po&s;&s;ibly be car|ried, it will be difficult for us, be|fore, or even after, a careful trial, exactly to determine. This is cer|tain, that attempts of this kind are every day made even by tho&s;e who philo&s;ophize the mo&s;t negligently: and nothing can be more requi&s;ite than to enter upon the enterprize with thorough care and attention; that, if it lie within the compa&s;s of human under&s;tanding, it may at la&s;t be happily atchieved; if not, it may, however, be rejected with &s;ome con|fidence and &s;ecurity. This la&s;t con|clu&s;ion, &s;urely, is not de&s;irable; nor ought it to be embraced too ra&s;hly. For how much mu&s;t we
<PB N="82" REF="99">
dimini&s;h from the beauty and value of this &s;pecies of philo&s;ophy, upon &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition? Morali&s;ts have hitherto been accu&s;tomed, when they con&s;idered the va&s;t multitude and diver&s;ity of actions that excite our approbation or di&s;like, to &s;earch for &s;ome common principle, on which this variety of &s;entiments might de|pend. And though they have &s;ome times carried the matter too far, by their pa&s;&s;ion for &s;ome one general principle, it mu&s;t, however, be con|fe&s;&s;ed, that they are excu&s;able in expecting to find &s;ome general prin|ciples, into which all the vices and virtues were ju&s;tly to be re&s;olved. The like has been the endeavour of critics, logicians, and even politi|cians:
<PB N="83" REF="100">
nor have their attempts been wholly un&s;ucce&s;sful; though per|haps longer time, greater accuracy, and more ardent application, may bring the&s;e &s;ciences &s;till nearer their perfection. To throw up at once all preten&s;ions of this kind may ju&s;tly be deemed more ra&s;h, preci|pitate, and dogmatical, than even the bolde&s;t and mo&s;t affirmative philo&s;ophy, which has ever at|tempted to impo&s;e its crude dictates and principles on mankind.</P>
<P>What though the&s;e rea&s;onings concerning human nature &s;eem ab|&s;tract, and of difficult comprehen|&s;ion? This affords no pre&s;umption of their fal&s;ehood. On the contrary,
<PB N="84" REF="101">
it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible, that what has hitherto e&s;caped &s;o many wi&s;e and profound philo&s;ophers can be very obvious and ea&s;y. And whatever pains the&s;e re&s;earches may co&s;t us, we may think our&s;elves &s;ufficiently rewarded, not only in point of pro|fit but of plea&s;ure, if, by that means, we can make any addition to our &s;tock of knowledge, in &s;ubjects of &s;uch un&s;peakable importance.</P></Q>
<P>But as we read Mr. Hume's life, written by his own hand, we &s;hall have fre&s;h opportunities to clear up any doubts that may remain of his &s;incerity. It &s;eems pretty evident, that the little &s;ketch, called MY OWN LIFE, was thought nece&s;&s;ary, by Mr. Hume, to
<PB N="85" REF="102">
be before hand with his philo&s;ophic antagoni&s;ts, whom, he fore&s;aw, would rai&s;e new outcries again&s;t him, upon the ideas they might indulge con|cerning tho&s;e clo&s;ing &s;en&s;ations which would attack him, within fight of the grave. To prevent little tri|umphs of this nature, I &s;ay, it is highly probable he cho&s;e the fairer method of being his <HI>own</HI> hi&s;torian; and never was there a biographical tract drawn up by any man in the highe&s;t health, with more coolne&s;s, more conci&s;ene&s;s, more impartiality.</P>
<P>He &s;at down to this extraordi|nary employment, and took up the pen, exactly at the time that hun|dreds&mdash;I might, I believe, extend
<PB N="86" REF="103">
the number, to thou&s;ands,&mdash;wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> thinking he would begin the bitter groans of recantation.

He could not counterfeit the alterations which he did not feel ri&s;en in his mind; he was calm enough to give a can|did account of his literary life, when he <HI>knew</HI> him&s;elf to be <HI>incur|able.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="104">
After he had written it, he ob|&s;erves the &s;ame tranquil compo&s;ure, in regard to the nearer approaches of death: Nay, &s;uch was his &s;teadine&s;s to the principles by which he was directed, that, in a codicil to his will, he de&s;ired the narrative of his life might be prefixed to the next edition of his works.</P>

<P>Ye&s;terday about four o'clock af|ternoon, Mr. Hume expired. The near approach of his death became evident in the night between Thur&s;|day and Friday, when his di&s;ea&s;e became exce&s;&s;ive, and &s;oon weaken|ed him &s;o much, that he could no

<HEAD>SECTION V. PARALLEL BETWIXT HUME AND LORD CHESTERFIELD, BOTH WITH RESPECT TO ABILITIES, AND PRIN|CIPLES.</HEAD>
<P>WE have now &s;urveyed our object in the mo&s;t trying moments&mdash;We have &s;een him &s;uperior to all ordinary terrors, and equal to all occa&s;ions. It is taken for granted, therefore, that as a philo&s;opher, both in precept and practice, it will be allowed he was compleat, exact,

unchangeable&mdash;that, whether wrong or right, he acted, immediately, from his own bo&s;om conviction; a conviction grounded upon inten&s;e and ab&s;tract attention, and not taken up &s;uddenly without re&s;pect either to cau&s;e or to con&s;equence. Thus far, then, the point is cleared before me; but I cannot per&s;uade my&s;elf to re&s;ign Mr. Hume till I have done ampler ju&s;tice to his memory, and to that &s;ocial, and <HI>hone&s;t</HI> conduct which &s;o much endears it.</P>
<P>I would draw a &s;light parallel be|twixt this gentlemen, and another celebrated writer, who de&s;cended in|to the tomb a little before him. I would per&s;uade the reader to com|pare
<PB N="97" REF="114">
with me the &s;y&s;tem of Da|vid Hume, and that of the late Earl of Che&s;terfield. Not with a view of propo&s;ing the former to his imitation&mdash;for that point &s;hould always be &s;ettled by a man's own mind, after a great deal of pre|meditation upon the matter&mdash;but, as it may &s;erve to &s;hew, what hath, indeed, been a principal en|deavour in the&s;e pages, that it is po&s;&s;ible even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or &s;ceptics, to be more worthy members of &s;ociety, more reverend to a fir&s;t cau&s;e, whatever it may be, and more e&s;&s;entially the friend <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thus it is more and more obvious, that, the de&s;ire of literary &s;ame, had not the great|e&s;t &s;hare in prevailing with Mr. Hume to per&s;i&s;t in a philo&s;ophy little under&s;tood, little liked, and much di&s;reli&s;hed by the mo&s;t powerful bodies in the world, to wit, the &s;uper&s;titious and hypocritical.
<P>He was, therefore, not only a <HI>con&s;i&s;tent,</HI> but an <HI>hone&s;t</HI> writer. After he had tried the experiment with his unfortunate Treati&s;e and failed: after he had, in <HI>vain,</HI> can anew the Enquiry concerning Human Nature: after he had publi&s;hed his Moral and Political E&s;&s;ays, with as little &s;ucce&s;s: after the appearance of his Natural Hi&s;tory of Religion had met with a very cool reception; after all the&s;e mortifications, as he him&s;elf terms them, after all the&s;e variety of "winds and &s;ea|&s;ons," to which his writings had been ex|po&s;ed, with only tho&s;e little gales of fugi|tive good fortune, to con&s;ole him; the rail|ing of Doctor Warburton, and the illibe|rality of Bi&s;hop Hurd; &s;uch "was the force of his natural temper," &s;uch his "un&s;ur|mountable aver&s;ion to every thing but the pur&s;uits of philo&s;ophy" that, we find, by hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> dying confe&s;&s;ion, "the&s;e di&s;appoint|ment made little or no impre&s;&s;ion on him."

<P>From the&s;e &s;everal circum&s;tances, nothing can be plainer, than that, he was a &s;erious enquirer into the extent of the human under|&s;tanding: that he &s;ubmitted patiently to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> impediment that aro&s;e in the progre&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o arduous and unpopular a contempla|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">: that he was neither attracted by &s;ame, nor deterred by cen&s;ure. If he hath too fully indulged his pa&s;&s;ion, he did not err from any de&s;ire to <HI>deceive,</HI> becau&s;e he cer|tainly hoped to extricate truth from ob&s;cu|rity, and ab&s;urdity. If he was too adventrous he had the &s;ingular merit of not expecting either reputation or fortune for his mi&s;takes.

<P>Violent verbal a&s;&s;everations, and reli|gious tenacity of opinion are exceedingly &s;u&s;picious to the judicious, though they cap|tivate and enthral the vulgar and &s;imple. I mu&s;t once more advert to a horrid contra|diction of the zealots&mdash;the little corre&s;pon|dence, and, indeed, generally &s;peaking, the con&s;tant quarrelling there is betwixt their precept, and practice! Well might Hume ob&s;erve, that, if we examime the lives of the&s;e men, we &s;hould &s;carcely think that they repo&s;ed the &s;malle&s;t confidence in their pious prote&s;ations. What! cannot the de|lightful belief of an ever-protecting real Pre&s;ence,&mdash;cannot the charming hopes of Omnipotent favour, nor the merits of a Saviour, nor the expectations of a ble&s;&s;ed Immortality, infu&s;e inter the&s;e &s;luggi&s;h re|ligioni&s;ts, an emulative &s;pirit to exceed the goodne&s;s, and common conduct of men, like David Hume, who believed all the&s;e fair pro&s;pects, to be "a riddle, an aenig|ma, an inexplicable my&s;tery."</P>

and tender imperfections of men le&s;s capable to di&s;&s;emble. This faculty, is at be&s;t, but a principal ingredient in the character of a <HI>cunning</HI> fellow, who, as it were, by imperceptible &s;light of hand, hath the art of ap|pearing what he is not; and of cheating you, with &s;ingular dexte|rity, even before your face.</P>
<P>But all the &s;ame, of popular eti|quette that could po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e from &s;uch practices, Hume would have di&s;carded with di&s;dain. And, chief|ly for two rea&s;ons: fir&s;t, his genius had not a &s;ingle grain of the petit maitre in it, which, by the way, was a con&s;iderable ingredient in Lord Che&s;terfield's; and, &s;econdly, he had too much dignity in his na|ture

and too ju&s;t a &s;en&s;e of the &s;o|cial compact between the indivi|dual, and the whole human race, to find any ze&s;t in gratifications, which emanated from, neither more, nor le&s;s, than flagrant treachery. Hence it appears obvious enough, that the Earl of Che&s;terfield's heart and head, were both unable to bear any &s;ort of parallel, with the head and heart of David Hume. The one is the Author of a &s;y&s;tem which &s;eems to have been pillaged from the Dancing-ma&s;ter, the Perfumer, and the Devil: the other pur|&s;ues a philo&s;ophy, which, with all its exceptions, gives coun|tenance neither to the follies of a coxcomb, nor the meanne&s;s, and

<HEAD>SECTION VI. OF PROPER CAUTIONS PRIOR TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF OUR RELIGI|OUS CREDENDA.</HEAD>
<P>WITH regard to the &s;ceptical doubts which might &s;tart into the philo&s;ophical and rea&s;oning mind of Mr. Hume, it is, I once more re|peat, no part of my office, to de|fend or to cen&s;ure them. As a va|riety of men have employed their talents on <HI>one</HI> &s;ide of an important &s;ubject, he hath taken the liberty, as a philo&s;opher, to offer his opi|nions,

on the <HI>other</HI> &s;ide: con&s;idered in the light of &s;peculation, this is certainly fair; for who can circum|&s;cribe the efforts of a mind, bent for any length of time, on one fa|vourite point?</P>
<P>The &s;y&s;tems of either party, how|ever, ought not to &s;way any man again&s;t the concurrence of his own rea&s;on; for, at that rate, one might be a Chri&s;tian, a Dei&s;t, a Mahome|tan, or an Athei&s;t, in obedience to the bidding of another: by which means our religion would have more colours than the camelion, and more alterations than Proteus. A &s;en&s;ible man, will never have &s;er|vility enough for this. If he is yet
<PB N="116" REF="133">
une&s;tabli&s;hed in his more &s;erious te|nets, he will &s;ee what can be &s;aid both <HI>for</HI> and <HI>again&s;t:</HI> of oppo&s;ite principles, it is his bu&s;ine&s;s to fix upon tho&s;e which appear the mo&s;t congruous, and probable. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rea&s;on, indeed, I know not why, hath long been <HI>unrea&s;onably</HI> denied a proper ex|erci&s;e of her power, in religious matters; while Faith is honoured with the priviledge of in&s;i&s;ting upon implicit obedience: yet the former, is called the noble&s;t faculty of hu|man nature, and the latter, &s;hould, certainly, only be allowed to follow in the train. The common argument, is little more than this,&mdash;You mu&s;t believe, becau&s;e you mu&s;t believe. It is in vain to pretend any regard to proba|bilities; or to urge, again&s;t things &s;acred, the convictions of clo&s;e rea&s;oning&mdash;Rea&s;on is out of the que&s;tion.&mdash;Is it not written in <HI>the Book?</HI> The que&s;tion, to be &s;ure, mu&s;t not be an&s;wered, but in one way. You <HI>mu&s;t</HI> have Faith.&mdash;Now, it appears to me, that to call Rea&s;on our &s;overeign di&s;tinction, and yet reject its influence in points of eternal moment, while we affect to ob&s;erve its dic|tates in matters indifferent, is ju&s;t as rational as if we were to hold &s;acred and obligatory, tho&s;e edicts of parliament which regulate our more public &s;pectacles,&mdash;&s;uch as plays and puppet-&s;hews; while we &s;nap our fingers at the &s;tate, and the per&s;onage who rules it, whenever a mandate is i&s;&s;ued for the good order, and welfare of what is mo&s;t impor|tant to the policy, power, or pro&s;perity of nations. This method of <HI>forcing</HI> any par|ticular faith upon a man, though it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aking an enemy by &s;urpri&s;e, is, yet, ridiculous enough in its nature, to admit an illu&s;tration, in the following pa&s;&s;ages from Henry Fielding's Romance of Jo&s;eph Andrews.
<P>"Mr. Barnabas was again &s;ent for, and with much difficulty prevailed on to make another vi&s;it. As &s;oon as he entered the room, he told Jo&s;eph, 'he was come to pray by him, and to prepare him for another world: In the fir&s;t place therefore, he hoped he had repented of all his &s;ins?' Jo&s;eph an&s;wered, 'he hoped he had: but there was no one thing which he knew not whether he &s;hould call a &s;in; if it was, he feared he &s;hould die in the commi&s;&s;ion of it, and that was the re|gret of parting with a young woman, whom he loved as tenderly as he did his heart|&s;trings?' Barnabas bad him be a&s;&s;ured, that 'any repining at the Divine Will, was one of the greate&s;t &s;ins he could commit; that he ought to forget all carnal affections, and think of better things.' Jo&s;eph &s;aid, 'that neither in this world, nor the next, he could forget his Fanny, and that the thought, however grievous, of parting from her for ever, was not half &s;o tormenting, as the fear of what &s;he would &s;uffer when &s;he knew his misfortune.' Barnabas &s;aid, 'that &s;uch fears argued a diffidence and de&s;pondence very criminal; that he mu&s;t dive&s;t him&s;elf of all human pa&s;&s;ion, and fix his heart above.' Jo&s;eph an&s;wered, 'that was what he de&s;ired to do, and &s;hould be obliged to him, if he would enable him to accompli&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">' Barnabas replied,'that mu&s;t be done by Grace.' Jo&s;eph be&s;ought him to di&s;cover how he might attain it.' Barnabas an&s;|wered, 'by Prayer and Faith.' He then que&s;tioned him concerning his forgivene&s;s of the Thieves. Jo&s;eph an&s;wered, 'he feared, that was more than he could do: for no|thing would give him more plea&s;ure than to hear they were taken.' 'That,' cries Bar|nabas, 'is for the &s;ake of ju&s;tice.' 'Yes,' &s;aid Jo&s;eph, 'but if I was to meet them again, I am afraid I &s;hould attack them, and kill them too, if I could.' 'Doubtle&s;s,' an&s;wered Barnabas, 'it is lawful to kill a thief: but can you &s;ay, you forgive them as a Chri&s;tian ought?' Jo&s;eph de&s;ired to know what that forgivene&s;s was. 'That is,' an&s;|wered Barnabas, 'to forgive them as&mdash;as&mdash;it is to forgive them as&mdash;in &s;hort, it is to forgive them as a Chri&s;tian.' Jo&s;eph replied, 'he forgave them as much as he could.' 'Well, well,' &s;aid Barnabas, 'that will do.' 'He then demanded of him, if he remembered any more &s;ins unrepented of; and if he did, he de&s;ired him to make ha&s;te and repent of them as fa&s;t as he could: that they might repeat over a few prayers to|gether.' Jo&s;eph an&s;wered, 'he could not recollect any great crimes he had been guilty of, and that thofe he had committed, he was &s;incerely &s;orry for.' Barnabas &s;aid that was enough, and then proceeded to prayer with all the expedition he was ma&s;ter of: &s;ome company then waiting for him below in the parlour, where the ingredients for punch were all in readine&s;s; but no one would &s;qeeze the oranges till he came."</P>
<P>I am afraid the arguments of Mr. Bar|nabas are, for the mo&s;t part, full as cogent as tho&s;e which impo&s;e a &s;y&s;tem upon us, without allowing us to con&s;ult the under|&s;tanding.&mdash;Are they <HI>afraid</HI> we &s;hould re|fer to &s;o &s;ober an authority as Rea&s;on? Is it for their <HI>intere&s;t</HI> to make us the mere tools of credulity? Is it political to beat us, <HI>vi, et armis,</HI> into adoption of their favourite tenets? Such an a&s;&s;ault upon vulgar, timid minds, may be very alarming; but, I con|fe&s;s, I could never be inclined, either to Die&s;m, Mahomati&s;m, or Chri&s;tianity by <HI>compul&s;ion.</HI> The Philo&s;opher, will, &s;o far at lea&s;t, be a free agent, and, like poor Jo&s;eph, believe <HI>as well,</HI> and <HI>as much as he can.</HI></P></NOTE>Rea&s;on

Similar to this, &s;hould be the procedure of any per&s;on une&s;tabli&s;h|ed in his religious concerns. It is too important an article to take up on mere tru&s;t.

<P>YOUR very <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> epi&s;tle, wet from the Clarendon pre&s;s, was brought to me by my book&s;eller, ju&s;t as I was correcting a proof &s;heet of that Apology, from the fir&s;t adverti&s;ement of which, in the news|papers, you &s;eem to have caught the hint of your title: I mean &s;o

&s;ub&s;i&s;ts only among philo&s;ophers; and they, to a man, hold Beattie's Book in contempt; which, is a phi|lo&s;ophy calculated only for ladies, and fine gentlemen.</P>
<P>Your arguments, Sir, are not much happier than your que&s;tions; as your remarks are in general, poorer than both. I &s;hall expo&s;e the futi|lity of the&s;e, as their ab&s;urdity oc|curs to my mind, upon a re-examin|ation of your Letter.</P>
<P>What you have called a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter, p. 39.</NOTE> "&s;um|mary of Mr. Hume's doctrines, me|taphy&s;ical and moral," is either a <HI>wilful</HI> or an <HI>ignorant,</HI> mi&s;repre&s;en|tation
<PB N="147" REF="163">
of Hume's &s;y&s;tem, which ne|ver in any one part or pa&s;&s;age, gave you fir&s;t cau&s;e to &s;ay, its author, at any time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter, p. 16.</NOTE> "&s;at down calmly and deliberately to obliterate from the hearts of the human &s;pecies every trace of the knowledge of God and his di&s;pen&s;ations." Much le&s;s did he endeavour to "extirpate all hope of enjoying God's grace and favour." On the contrary, I do again in&s;i&s;t, that Mr, Hume's philo&s;ophical &s;y&s;|tem, inculcated every thing prai&s;e|worthy <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Apology, Sect. 3. p. 70. 71. 72.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Secondly, Sir, you are upon a wrong ground in a&s;&s;erting that, to
<PB N="148" REF="164">
want hone&s;ty, and to want under|&s;tanding, and to want a leg, are equally the objects of <HI>moral</HI> di&s;ap|probatian.</P>
<P>This cannot be any part of David Hume's doctrine, neither can bear critical examination. In fact, the mo&s;t pitiable of all human objects is a di&s;hone&s;t reprobate, for nothing can &s;o truly be compa&s;&s;ionated as a man who hath not even <HI>policy</HI> enough to be <HI>hone&s;t,</HI> yet he is certainly an ob|ject of moral di&s;approbation; and tho' it may be very proper to pity him, it is equally proper that, for the &s;ake of an example, and for the &s;ervice of mankind, he &s;hould be puni&s;hed. A criminal pleaded upon
<PB N="149" REF="165">
his trial, as an extenuation of his offence, that he was <HI>prede&s;tined</HI> to commit it: I am heartily &s;orry for that friend, &s;aid the judge, but by the &s;ame rule, I am prede&s;tined to order you to be hanged. Breaking a leg is a&s;&s;uredly a pitiable circum|&s;tance, but, in point of culpability, &s;hall it be equally immoral with want of hone&s;ty? Nor did I ever know before that, want of <HI>under|&s;tanding,</HI> was to be imputed to a man, as criminal, though it may &s;ometimes be attributed to his weak|ne&s;s, or want of application.&mdash;Again, can a <HI>whole</HI> leg be called a corporcal <HI>virtue;</HI> or can a broken one be termed with any propriety, a corporeal <HI>vice?</HI> Corporeal virtues,
<PB N="150" REF="166">
mu&s;t be per&s;onal virtues; &s;uch as charity, cleanline&s;s, continence, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething &s;o unaccount|able in this &s;entence, Sir, that I &s;hould e&s;teem my&s;elf very much obliged to you if you would inter|cede with your <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Po&s;t&s;cript to Letter, p. 38.</NOTE> learned friend, who drew up a comprehen&s;ive &s;um|mary of Hume's doctrines, to re|fer me to that pa&s;&s;age in our Phi|lo&s;opher's Works which treats of this matter.</P>
<P>I beg references al&s;o, by help of the &s;ame medium, to tho&s;e parts of
<PB N="151" REF="167">
Hume, which is, you &s;ay, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter, p. 28.</NOTE> "de|&s;igned to prove the <HI>&s;oul's mortality,"</HI> an attempt which I cannot with the clo&s;e&s;t attention perceive, was ever made. Hints about his ju&s;tification of <HI>&s;elf-murder,</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">London Review.</NOTE> are, as &s;ome cri|tics have already ob&s;erved, "candour it&s;elf requires, we &s;hould not attack a work, which the Author him&s;elf had abandoned, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure reprobated."</P>
<P>By way of contra&s;t to the beha|viour of Mr. Hume, you lay before us, for the choice of our adoption, the behaviour of Hooker the Chri&s;|tian.&mdash;I am curious to know the
<PB N="152" REF="168">
rea&s;ons for propo&s;ing Hooker as a contra&s;t to Hume.&mdash;Was there any thing in the conduct of their la&s;t moments which &s;o materially di&s;tin|gui&s;hed them? Let us draw the curtain, and ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>Immediately before the Author of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Polity expired, he &s;pake thus:</P>
<P>"I have lived to &s;ee, that this world is made up of perturbations; and I have been long preparing to leave it, and gathering comfort for the dreadful hour of making my account with God, which I now apprehend to be near. And though I have, by his grace, loved him in my youth, and feared him in mine

age, and laboured to have a con|&s;cience void of offence, towards him, and towards all men, yet, if thou, Lord, &s;houlde&s;t be extreme to mark what I have done ami&s;s, who can abide it? And therefore, where I have failed, Lord, &s;hew mercy to me; for I plead not my righteou&s;ne&s;s, but the forgivene&s;s of my unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, through His merits, who died to purcha&s;e par|don for penitent &s;inners. And &s;ince I owe thee a death, Lord, let it not be terrible, and then take thine own time; I &s;ubmit to it. Let not mine, O Lord, but thy will be done!&mdash;God hath heard my daily petitions; for I am at peace with all men, and he is at peace with
<PB N="154" REF="170">
me. From &s;uch ble&s;&s;ed a&s;&s;urance I feel that inward joy, which this world can neither give, nor take from me. My con&s;cience beareth me this witne&s;s; and this witne&s;s makes the thoughts of death joyful. I could wi&s;h to live, to do the Church more &s;ervice; but cannot hope it; for my days are pa&s;t, as a &s;hadow that returns not."</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life, p. 42.</NOTE> When Hume's &s;ymptoms re|turned with violence upon him, he from that moment gave up all thoughts of recovery, and &s;ubmit|ed with the utmo&s;t chearfulne&s;s, and the mo&s;t perfect re&s;ignation and
<PB N="155" REF="171">
complacency: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Smith's Letter, p. 51.</NOTE> he always talked of his approaching di&s;&s;olution with great cheerfulne&s;s, but never affect|ed to make any parade of his mag|nanimity. When even the conver|&s;ation of his friends became oppre&s;|&s;ive and fatiguing, he was quite free from <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Smith's Letter, p. 54.</NOTE> anxiety, or impatience. Even the la&s;t &s;tage of his di&s;order, when it even co&s;t him an effort to &s;peak, and when he had occa&s;ion to addre&s;s the <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Smith's Letter, p. 58.</NOTE> people about him, he always did it with affection and tenderne&s;s.&mdash;After all this he died "in &s;uch a happy compo&s;ure of
<PB N="156" REF="172">
mind, that nothing could exceed it."</P>
<P>I look in vain for a <HI>di&s;tinct differ|ence</HI> between the la&s;t moments of Hume and Hooker, Sir. Did Hooker "labour to be at peace with all men?" So did Hume, who had "<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Smith's Letter to Mr. Strahan, p. 48.</NOTE> no enemies on which he wi&s;hed to revenge him&s;elf." Did Hooker live to &s;ee, that, "<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letter, p. 32.</NOTE> this world is made up of perturbations?" So did Hume, who&mdash;though the later period of his life was the mo&s;t agreeable to him, and though he &s;aw many &s;ymptoms of his literary
<PB N="157" REF="173">
reputation breaking out at la&s;t with additional lu&s;tre&mdash;con&s;idered that, "<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life, p. 31.</NOTE> a man of &s;ixty-five, by dying, cuts off only a few years of infirmi|ties," in&s;omuch that he declares, almo&s;t with his dying breath, that, "it would be difficult to be more detached from life" than he was at that cri&s;is.</P>
<P>Point out to me then, I conjure you, Sir, the &s;uperiority in the manner of Hooker's dying. I own I cannot, without &s;ome peculiar a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, find it out. And, I tru&s;t, likewi&s;e, that &s;uch readers of my APOLOGY, as are neither, "<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letter, p. 2</NOTE> bi|gots,
<PB N="158" REF="174">
enthu&s;ia&s;ts, nor enemies to human learning," will be fully con|vinced that the influences of the philo&s;ophy which are the object of our pre&s;ent di&s;pute, were in no degree <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter, p. 30.</NOTE> pe&s;tilential.</P>
<P>From what has been already urged, you will perceive, Sir, that I by no means think that your Letter to Dr. Adam Smith is <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It were no difficult matter, to prove al&s;o that you have not written <HI>ingeniou&s;ly;</HI> &s;e|veral gro&s;s blunders, which even hurry can|not excu&s;e, occurring in different parts of your pamphlet. Thus, in Adverti&s;ement, p. 1. you "made your remarks, becau&s;e you thought them true." What, Sir, "did you think them true <HI>before</HI> the thoughts were made." P. 4. of Letter, you u&s;e the word <HI>proportion</HI> for portion, by which mi&s;take the pa&s;&s;age is truly ridiculous. P. 4. you &s;ay you never knew what hatred was? No 1 What, do not you hate vice, and the villain? Good, meek, milky-minded man, the friends of virtue and hone&s;ty are much obliged to you for that truly! P. 10. you talk facetiou&s;ly of <HI>dying</HI> as in&s;en&s;ibly and fooli&s;hly as you can for the <HI>life</HI> of you: you &s;ay you are a <HI>South Britain.</HI> Who would not have thought you were ju&s;t exported from the banks of the Shannon?

I fly at nobler game. The atrocious cruelty of in&s;i&s;ting that a writer diffu&s;ed <HI>Athoi&s;m,</HI> who never <HI>did</HI> diffu&s;e any &s;uch thing, is a &s;ub|ject that concerns every body."</NOTE> <HI>ingenuou&s;ly</HI>

<P>After all, Sir, how can you al|low your pen &s;uch a licence&mdash;a li|cence, you would not dared to have indulged, had the philo&s;opher been in the land of the living&mdash;as to &s;ay that his exi&s;tence was pa&s;&s;ed <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letter, p 32.</NOTE> with|out God in the world? Though his
<PB N="161" REF="177">
notions of a &s;upreme Power might not perhaps directly tally with yours, how are you able to tell that &s;uch a power did not as highly approve his arguments as your own? Would you pronounce a &s;entence of dam|nation again&s;t the Indian for his wor&s;hip to the &s;un&mdash;again&s;t the Ma|hometan for his homage to the Prophet&mdash;again&s;t the Chine&s;e for his idolatry to a &s;culptured image&mdash;again&s;t the Per&s;ian for his pro&s;tration to a cloud? All the&s;e people have different ideas of a a Deity from you.&mdash;None of the&s;e are Chri&s;tians&mdash;Millions of them believe <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter, p. 31.</NOTE> nothing about the Son&mdash;Many of them are, moral, &s;ocial,
<PB N="162" REF="178">
pious, humane, charitable&mdash;Shall they, neverthele&s;s, not &s;ee life, but &s;hall the wrath of God, &s;o furiou&s;ly denounced by St. John, abide on them?</P>
<P>I am &s;hocked at &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem. Yet the ca&s;e is parallel. Fie upon it, Sir. It is not the part of a Chri&s;|tian pa&s;tor to be extreme to mark even what is done ami&s;s, nor is it characteri&s;tic either of a follower of Je&s;us, or of a &s;ervant of the eter|nal Father, to &s;natch from the hand of that father,</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay on Man.</NOTE>&mdash;"the ballance or the rod."</P>
<P>Although, you have taken upon you to "rejudge his ju&s;tice, and
<PB N="163" REF="179">
be the God of God." All that part of your Letter, therefore, Sir, which would repre&s;ent Mr. Hume as unworthy the mercy, or protec|tion of a Providence, is arrogant, in&s;olent, ignorant, and pre&s;ump|tuous.</P>
<P>But, to &s;ay the truth, and do you full ju&s;tice, you &s;eem, Sir, to pro|&s;e&s;s a notable talent for mi&s;repre&s;ent|ing the &s;entiments of tho&s;e whom you are plea&s;ed to cen&s;ure. I am &s;orry to find you do not think Dr. Smith's <HI>good meaning</HI> will &s;ucceed; becau&s;e,&mdash;without the lea&s;t mix|ture of your beloved irony&mdash;I really think his de&s;ign was perfectly laud|able.
<PB N="164" REF="180">
I &s;ee nothing wrong in his per&s;uading us to follow the example of David Hume, becau&s;e, I per|ceive, not a &s;yllable that propo&s;es Athei&s;m as a cordial for low &s;pi|rits, and the proper antidote again&s;t the fear of death. If <HI>you</HI> perceive &s;uch &s;entiments, I again repeat, that, it becomes you, Sir, as a fair-deal|ing Chri&s;tian, who ought to do ju&s;tice betwixt man and man, to be more particular in your references, and not to be <Q>laughing wild In <HI>merry</HI> madne&s;s.</Q></P>
