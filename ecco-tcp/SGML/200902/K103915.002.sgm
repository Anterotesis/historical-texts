<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE Chevalier DES ESSARS AND THE Counte&s;s OF BERCI. PART IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE old Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> being at <HI>Paris</HI> a few Days after his Son's Departure for <HI>Ga&s;cony,</HI> hap|pened to meet &s;ome Gentlemen of that Pro|vince who were ju&s;t arrived there: he im|mediately enquired after the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars;</HI> and was told that he lived with the old Marquis <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> his Uncle, both in|tirely engro&s;&s;ed by a very important Affair, which made his Stay in <HI>Ga&s;cony</HI> ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. The Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> greatly &s;urpri&s;ed, a&s;ked them what Affair he could be engaged in, of &s;o much Con&s;e|quence
<PB N="2" REF="3">
as to make him neglect the Care of his Honour and his Life?</P>
<P>'I perceive, Mon&s;ieur,' &s;aid one of the Ga&s;cons,
<Q>that you are wholly unacquainted with an Incident which will account for the Chevalier's Attachment to <HI>Ga&s;cony.</HI> He is pa&s;&s;ionately in Love with a young Lady of that Province: &s;he is called the fair <HI>Amazon,</HI> &s;ome very extraordinary Qua|lities give her a ju&s;t Claim to this Title. She does not yield in Courage and Spirit to the brave&s;t among us: and if we may judge of her Force by the manly Exer|ci&s;es in which &s;he delights, and really ex|cels in, &s;he equals any of the &s;amed Amazons of old who were &s;o much ce|lebrated for their Valour. With all this, her Per&s;on is as lovely as the lovelie&s;t of her Sex; her Birth very illu&s;trious, and her Fortune immen&s;e. This is the Chain that binds the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> to <HI>Ga&s;cony,</HI> and will probably fix him there for the re&s;t of his Life.</Q></P>
<P>The Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> now no longer doubted, that this new Pa&s;&s;ion was the Cau&s;e of the Chevalier's Indifference and Neglect not only of them, but his own Ho|nour and Fame. He repented that he had &s;ent his Son into <HI>Ga&s;cony;</HI> and returning to <HI>Champigni</HI> full of Re&s;entment, imparted all he had heard to his Wife, to the young Mar|chione&s;s,
<PB N="3" REF="4">
and even to the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> his Daughter.</P>
<P>The two former were greatly &s;urpri&s;ed and afflicted at &s;uch unexpected News: but what Ravage did not the &s;ad Recital make in the Heart of the unfortunate Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci!</HI> She became a Prey to every violent and torturing Pa&s;&s;ion that injured Love in|&s;pires; Rage, Grief, Jealou&s;y and Shame tore her &s;oft Heart by Turns. Unable, tho' de&s;irous to conceal her &s;trong Emotions, &s;he ha&s;tened to her own Apartment, and locking the Door, threw her&s;elf upon her Bed in Agonies impo&s;&s;ible to be de&s;cribed, or even conceived but by a Woman, injured and for&s;aken, yet pa&s;&s;ionately in Love.</P>
<P>Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> had always been re|markable for her Sen&s;e and Prudence: her Fortitude, her Re&s;ignation under unmerited Infamy, and threatened Death, had ac|quired her univer&s;al Admiration and E&s;teem; but &s;lighted Love was a Torment &s;he had never felt, and found by &s;ad Experience &s;he was unequal to. Her Grief, at fir&s;t too big for Utterance, almo&s;t rent her tender Frame in Pieces, di&s;tractedly &s;he tore her Hair, and beat her lovely Bo&s;om. How altered now from that &s;weet patient Sufferer, who in a gloomy Pri&s;on could be &s;till &s;erene, who could arm her Mind again&s;t the Terrors of approaching Death, and &s;elf-acquitted de&s;|pi&s;e the Slanders of a malicious World, to
<PB N="4" REF="5">
which her Fame was &s;acrificed and her Life condemned. Had &s;he been capable of Re|flexion in tho&s;e &s;ad Moments, &s;he would have loathed her&s;elf for a Weakne&s;s, un|worthy of her Character: but Rea&s;on and Religion had now lo&s;t their Force, or &s;he rejected their offered Aid, and &s;uffered no Thought to ri&s;e in her Mind, but what ag|gravated her Injuries, and increa&s;ed her De&s;pair.</P>
<P>'Perfidious Wretch,' cried &s;he as &s;oon as the &s;tubborn Sorrow found vent in Tears,
<Q>and ungrateful as perfidious, is it thus you abandon me after &s;o many Vows of eternal Fidelity? You might have de|ferred this cruel Outrage till I had re|covered that Honour your fatal Pa&s;&s;ion has been the Means of my lo&s;ing. Alas!</Q>
pur|&s;ued &s;he wringing her Hands,
<Q>my lo&s;t Re|putation, my cruel Impri&s;onment, my ignominious Sentence, all are light Evils compared with what I feel at being thus betrayed, de&s;pi&s;ed, abandoned &mdash; but I will not live to endure this Mi&s;ery &mdash; Yes, Wretch, my Death &mdash;</Q>
Here &s;he &s;topped upon &s;ome Per&s;on's knocking at her Chamber-Door, which &s;he reluctantly opened, a&s;hamed of being found in &s;uch Di&s;order; but &s;eeing only the young Mar|chione&s;s <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> her Si&s;ter-in-law, that tender faithful Friend, from whom &s;he hid no Secret of her Soul, &s;he eagerly &s;trained her in her Arms, and leaning her Head upon
<PB N="5" REF="6">
her Bo&s;om, gave Way to a violent Bur&s;t of Tears.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s, greatly affected at this Sight, locked the Door carefully again, and then led the fair afflicted Counte&s;s to a Soffa, where &s;eating her&s;elf be&s;ide her, and ten|derly &s;upporting her with one Arm round her Wai&s;t, while with the other &s;he wiped away the Tears that &s;treamed from her charming Eyes, &s;he endeavoured to comfort her by &s;ugge&s;ting every Argument her Ima|gination could furni&s;h her with in Favour of the Chevalier.</P>
<P>She repre&s;ented to her, that it was not at all po&s;&s;ible, the Chevalier, who had given her a thou&s;and &s;triking Proofs of the mo&s;t noble, the mo&s;t ardent Pa&s;&s;ion that ever ani|mated a Lover, &s;hould be able to quit her for any other Woman whatever Beauty and Merit &s;he was po&s;&s;e&s;t of; nor was it more likely that a Man, &s;o remarkably generous, noble and &s;incere, &s;hould be capable of &s;o black a Perfidy.</P>
<P><Q>But if we could &s;uppo&s;e, my deare&s;t Si&s;ter (&s;aid the Marchione&s;s) that the Che|valier was really incon&s;tant to you whom he has &s;o fervently loved, would he with a Soul &s;o great and daring, &s;uch an eager Thir&s;t for Fame, &s;o nicely tenacious of his Honour, would he neglect the glorious Opportunity that is now offered him, to
<PB N="6" REF="7">
prove his Innocence in the Eyes of all <HI>France?</HI> Ah! be a&s;&s;ured &s;ome other Cau&s;e than a new Pa&s;&s;ion detains him. Your Father him&s;elf is now of this Opinion, in which he is confirmed by his having heard nothing of the Me&s;&s;enger whom he &s;o long ago &s;ent to the Chevalier. Some Misfor|tune has doubtle&s;s happened to this Man, and the Chevalier is &s;till ignorant of the Arret, and of your Father's Me&s;&s;age.</Q></P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s had indeed hit upon the Truth, but her Arguments, &s;trong as they were, made no Impre&s;&s;ion upon the Coun|te&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> who&s;e Jealou&s;y, Rage and De&s;pair had &s;o weakened all her rea&s;oning Powers, that &s;he was incapable of making any Reflexion but what was &s;ugge&s;ted by tho&s;e furious Pa&s;&s;ions. She thought her&s;elf the mo&s;t mi&s;erable undone Woman in the World; and in Con&s;equence of this Notion, &s;he conceived the mo&s;t extravagant De&s;ign that ever entered into the Mind of a Wo|man of her Virtue, Education, and natural Timidity.</P>
<P>Affecting to &s;eem a little con&s;oled by her Si&s;ter-in-law's Rea&s;ons, &s;he begged to be left alone in order to recollect and compo&s;e her&s;elf, that &s;he might be able to appear be|fore her Parents the next Day. The Mar|chione&s;s left her, after giving her a tender Embrace; and Madam <HI>de Berci,</HI> who&s;e Head was full of her new Scheme, continued ru|minating
<PB N="7" REF="8">
upon it till her Woman came to take her Commands at Night: &s;he &s;uffered her&s;elf to be undre&s;t and put to Bed, pre|tending that &s;he was extremely &s;leepy, in or|der to prevent any Me&s;&s;ages from her Parents, and her Si&s;ter-in-law; and as &s;oon as &s;he imagined all the Family was a&s;leep, &s;he got out of Bed, and, throwing a loo&s;e Gown about her, went &s;oftly into her Brother's Wardrobe, where &s;he cho&s;e from among &s;everal Suits of Cloaths one which he had worn but once or twice, and was le&s;s re|markable than any of the others. The&s;e Cloaths &s;he put on, and tied up her beautiful fair Hair under a Hat adorned with a green Feather.</P>
<P>Thus metamorpho&s;ed, &s;he went &s;oftly down Stairs with an Intention to go into the Stable and get a Hor&s;e, but recollecting that &s;he wanted a Sword, &s;he returned ha&s;tily to the Wardrobe, and finding one to her Wi&s;h, plain and unadorned, &s;he made the be&s;t of her Way to the Stable, cho&s;e one of the be&s;t Hor&s;es in it, and mounted with great Pre|cipitation, for the Morning now dawned, and &s;he was apprehen&s;ive &s;ome of the Ser|vants would &s;oon be &s;tirring. She &s;allied out and took the fir&s;t Road that pre&s;ented it&s;elf, her Heart throbbing with a thou&s;and new Anxieties, and her Head full of a wild Pro|ject which &s;he had too little con&s;idered to &s;ee all the fatal Con&s;equences of.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="9">Her De&s;ign was to travel to <HI>Ga&s;cony,</HI> in Search of her faithle&s;s Lover, to upbraid him with his Perfidy and to revenge his Lo&s;s upon her happy Rival, and then to bury her&s;elf in &s;ome Solitude where &s;he &s;hould never be heard of more.</P>
<P>Oh, Love, how much is thy tyrant Power to be feared, when a cau&s;ele&s;s Jealou&s;y, an unrea&s;onable Su&s;picion can produce &s;uch dreadful Effects, and thus turn a Woman, wi&s;e, gentle, mode&s;t, into an extravagant and fooli&s;h Adventurer! The Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> although &s;he had di&s;covered &s;o much Strength of Mind and chri&s;tian Fortitude while &s;he langui&s;hed amid&s;t the Horrors of a gloomy Pri&s;on, had all that amiable Soft|ne&s;s and female Delicacy, which di&s;tingui&s;h Women of her Birth, Education and Virtue. Yet behold her now in the Habit of a Man, wandering defencele&s;s and alone. She who prefered her Reputation to her Life, and cho&s;e rather to &s;ubmit to a cruel and unju&s;t Im|pri&s;onment, than avoid it at the Expence of bringing any Imputation upon her Honour, now expo&s;ed that Honour to the infamous Cen&s;ures of a malicious World, by wearing a Di&s;gui&s;e &s;o little &s;uitable to her natural Mode&s;ty, and by a Flight &s;o unworthy of her Prudence and Character. She who had the highe&s;t Notions of filial Duty, left her indulgent Parents to all the Bitterne&s;s of Grief that her imagined Death could cau&s;e, and all the Di&s;grace &s;o &s;candalous an Elope|ment
<PB N="9" REF="10">
could reflect upon them. In&s;en&s;ible of their Sorrow, of what &s;he owed to the Me|mory of her murdered Lord, her own Repu|tation, Life and Virtue, &s;he pur&s;ued her de&s;perate Cour&s;e. Deceived by her own Heart, Revenge &s;he thought was all her Motive for a Conduct in Appearance &s;o ex|travagant; and a Motive &s;o noble, that, when known, it would be a &s;ufficient Ju&s;ti|fication.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he had got out of <HI>Champigny,</HI> her Hor&s;e, which had been accu&s;tomed to carry the young Marquis frequently from that Village to <HI>Paris,</HI> &s;truck directly into the Road which led to that great City, and brought her to the Gates ju&s;t as they were opened. Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> could not help &s;ighing when &s;he reflected upon the &s;trange Equipage in which &s;he was now entering a Place where &s;he had formerly enjoyed &s;o much Happine&s;s, and lived in &s;uch Splendor. But &s;he was too much engro&s;&s;ed by her pre|&s;ent wild Project to dwell long upon tho&s;e Remembrances, &s;he began now to con&s;ider what was mo&s;t proper for her to do. To prevent being di&s;covered, &s;he did not doubt but as &s;oon as &s;he was mi&s;&s;ed at <HI>Cham|pigny,</HI> it would be concluded &s;he had taken the direct Road to <HI>Ga&s;cony,</HI> and that &s;everal Per&s;ons would be immediately di&s;patched in Pur&s;uit of her; &s;he re&s;olved, therefore, to &s;tay &s;ome Days concealed in <HI>Paris,</HI> and de|fer her Journey to <HI>Ga&s;cony</HI> till tho&s;e who
<PB N="10" REF="11">
&s;hould be &s;ent after her, returned from their fruitle&s;s Pur&s;uit, when &s;he might pro&s;ecute her De&s;ign with Security.</P>
<P>Accordingly &s;he hired an Apartment in the lea&s;t frequented Quarter of <HI>Paris;</HI> and having de&s;ired her Landlord to procure her a Footman who&s;e Fidelity and Di&s;cretion &s;he might depend upon, and who was ca|pable to take Care of her Hor&s;e, &s;he retired to her Chamber, to indulge a few Hours Repo&s;e, if tho&s;e vain Efforts &s;he made to procure it, may be called Repo&s;e. But we will now leave her to the inward Agitations of her own Mind, and return to her Rela|tions at <HI>Champigny,</HI> who were all in the ut|mo&s;t Confu&s;ion and Di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The young Marchione&s;s, tenderly &s;olicitous for her Welfare, went to her Apartment as &s;oon as &s;he was up; &s;he found her Woman in waiting in the Antichamber who expre&s;|&s;ed &s;ome Surpri&s;e at her Lady's not ringing for her at her u&s;ual Hour. The Marchio|ne&s;s, a little alarmed, rapped at her Cham|ber-Door; no An&s;wer being returned, &s;he rapped again, and trembling with her Fears opened the Door immediately after; &s;he ad|vanced ha&s;tily to the Bed, and was &s;till more terrified to find &s;he was not there. Recol|lecting however that the Counte&s;s was fond of indulging her Melancholy in a &s;hady Re|ce&s;s of the Garden to which &s;he often re|&s;orted, Madam <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> ha&s;tily ran
<PB N="11" REF="12">
thither in full Expectation of finding her; but again di&s;appointed, &s;he gazed around her in A&s;toni&s;hment and Di&s;may, hardly knowing what &s;he feared, yet full of Ap|prehen&s;ion and Grief: having traver&s;ed the whole Garden without Succe&s;s, &s;he returned to the Hou&s;e, flattering her&s;elf that &s;he might po&s;&s;ibly meet her in her Mother's Apart|ment; upon her entering the old Marchio|ne&s;s's Chamber, that Lady eagerly advanced towards her, and with a Voice that expre&s;|&s;ed the highe&s;t Terror and Grief, cried:
<Q>Ah! my Dear, have you not then found my Daughter?</Q></P>
<P>The young Lady's melancholy Looks &s;ugge&s;ting the Wor&s;t to the apprehen&s;ive Mother, 'Alas!' exclaimed &s;he without giving her Time to an&s;wer,
<Q>my Daughter is dead.</Q>
<Q>No, no, dear Madam, be com|po&s;ed, &s;aid &s;he: I hope no Misfortune has happened to the Counte&s;s. I have not &s;een her indeed, but I hope and believe that &s;he is well, and &s;omewhere in the Hou&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>The old Marquis, who as well as his La|dy, had been alarmed by the Report of the Counte&s;s's Woman, that &s;he was not in her Chamber, and who had been &s;earching for her in every Room of the Hou&s;e, came in that Moment with his Daughter's Robe de Chambre in his Hand, which he had found in his Son's Wardrobe. But before he could
<PB N="12" REF="13">
&s;peak to tell in what Manner he had found it, the unhappy Mother &s;inking under her Fears at that Sight, fell in a Swoon in the Arms of her Daughter-in-law, who &s;eeing her Colour change, tenderly ran to &s;upport her. Proper Remedies being applied, her Sen&s;es returned; &s;he opened her Eyes, and faintly groaning:
<Q>'Tis &s;o, my Daughter's dead,</Q>
&s;aid &s;he. 'Alas!' &s;aid the old Marquis pierced to his inmo&s;t Soul with Grief,
<Q>it would be better, perhaps, if &s;he was dead; for &s;he has covered her&s;elf and her Family with Infamy.</Q>
He then &s;hewed the Robe to his Lady, told where he had found it, and gave it as his certain Opinion, that &s;he had fled di&s;gui&s;ed in a Suit of her Brother's Cloaths, which he had remembred to have &s;een him wear, and was not now in the Wardrobe.</P>
<P>This News at any other Time would have plunged the old Marchione&s;s into De|&s;pair, but it now relea&s;ed her from an ago|ni&s;ing Fear that her beloved Daughter was dead, and was welcomed with &s;ome Kind of Joy. But this la&s;ted no longer, than till her Mind, becoming more compo&s;ed, was at Liberty to reflect upon the &s;hameful Step the Counte&s;s had taken; &s;he then &s;aw Things in a different Light, and knew not whether her &s;candalous Flight was not more to be lamented than her Death. Me&s;&s;engers were immediately di&s;patched in Pur&s;uit of her, but all returned without Succe&s;s: the
<PB N="13" REF="14">
unhappy Parents, however, found &s;ome Al|leviation of their Grief in the Thought that their Son, to whom they had wrote on Ac|count of the Flight of the Counte&s;s, and her &s;trange Di&s;gui&s;e, would take Mea&s;ures to di&s;cover her in <HI>Ga&s;cony;</HI> for it was not doubted that &s;he was gone thither.</P>
<P>Mean Time the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> the innocent Cau&s;e of all this Confu&s;ion, pa&s;&s;ed his Time very unea&s;ily in <HI>Ga&s;cony;</HI> his Uncle was continually pre&s;&s;ing him in Favour of Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt,</HI> he urged to him the great Advantages that would accrue from an Alliance with a Woman of her illu&s;trious Birth, and immen&s;e Fortune; he prai&s;ed her Beauty, her fine Under&s;tanding, her Virtue, Spirit, and noble Re&s;olution, &s;o meritoriou&s;ly exerted in Defence of her Ho|nour and Freedom.</P>
<P>The Chevalier confe&s;&s;ed &s;he had great Merit; he admired her Beauty, he prai&s;ed the noble Qualities &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and he was plea&s;ed with her Conver&s;ation: but all this produced nothing but a few Vi&s;its from him to the charming Amazon, to whom he be|haved with the highe&s;t Re&s;pect and De|ference; but the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> was too much in his Head and Heart to allow of any Expre&s;&s;ions of Gallantry which a Beauty &s;o alluring mu&s;t have forced from any Man who&s;e Affections were di&s;engaged.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15">The Marquis <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> perceived that this Affair advanced very &s;lowly, he was very unea&s;y at it, and re&s;olved to &s;peak plainer to his Nephew than he had ever yet done. He took an Opportunity one Evening, when the Chevalier was returned from vi&s;iting Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt,</HI> to enter into a Conver&s;ation with him, which he had ob|&s;erved with Concern his Nephew had &s;eemed &s;olicitous to avoid. He told him that his own great Age, and his many Infirmities, would no longer permit him to attend to his Affairs, or take Part in any of tho&s;e Diver|&s;ions which formerly had contributed as much to his Health as to his Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><Q>I am now, &s;aid he, only capable of en|joying the &s;till Comforts of dome&s;tic Life. I earne&s;tly de&s;ire to fix you with me. You have hitherto led a di&s;&s;ipated and wandering Life, it is Time that you &s;hould &s;ettle, take Care of your E&s;tates, and per|petuate your Name. It is not my Inten|tion to hinder you from going to Court, when a proper Opportunity offers, to clear your Innocence with re&s;pect to the Deaths of the Counts of <HI>Berci</HI> and <HI>Polan:</HI> but till this Opportunity offers, I would have you make &s;uch a Di&s;po&s;ition of your Affairs, that I may promi&s;e my&s;elf you will fix your Re&s;idence in this Province, where at my Death you will have &s;uch large Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions; and that I may be a&s;&s;ured my Wi&s;hes will be gratified, you mu&s;t think
<PB N="15" REF="16">
of marrying &s;ome Lady of <HI>Ga&s;cony.</HI> I &s;ee none &s;o worthy of you as Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt:</HI> her Birth, her Beauty, her Virtue and immen&s;e Fortune may make her ju&s;tly con&s;idered as one of the be&s;t Matches in the Province. I know you cannot be in|&s;en&s;ible to her Charms; and if you have not yet declared your&s;elf to her, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be, that you are doubtful of &s;uc|ceeding. But as I have your Marriage with this Lady greatly at Heart, you may depend upon it, I will plead your Cau&s;e with the utmo&s;t Zeal. I think too well of your Judgment to be apprehen&s;ive, that this Af|fair will meet with any Difficulties from you, on account of your unwarantable Pa&s;|&s;ion for the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> to which your Honour as well as Quiet has been &s;acrificed: therefore, I do not think it nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;ure you that the Lo&s;s of my Favour and my whole E&s;tate will be the Con&s;equence of your refu&s;ing the Pro|po&s;al I have made you.</Q></P>
<P>The Chevalier was a good deal di&s;con|certed by this Speech, to which he li&s;tened in a profound Silence, not once offering to interrupt his Uncle, who, he found, was determined to marry him to Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt,</HI> and he well knew the ob&s;ti|nate old Man never receded from a Re&s;o|lution he had once taken. His Threat of depriving him of his E&s;tate would have had no Effect on the generous Mind of the Che|valier,
<PB N="16" REF="17">
had not the Delicacy and Di&s;in|tere&s;tedne&s;s of his Pa&s;&s;ion for Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> made him re&s;olve not to take Ad|vantage of her Tenderne&s;s, to give her a Hu&s;band who&s;e Fortunes were &s;o va&s;tly be|low her Quality and Merit. He had been always con&s;idered as the &s;ole Heir to the va&s;t Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of his Uncle, as well as to his Title: in that Quality he had offered him&s;elf to the Acceptance of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> his Honour would not permit him, when fallen from his Expectations, to urge her to the Performance of an Engagement made before, nor could his Love bear the Thought of re&s;igning her.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the&s;e perplexing Extremes, the only Medium was to gain Time, which in|deed was gaining every Thing. With this View, therefore, he told his Uncle, that he was extremely &s;en&s;ible of his tender Solici|tude for his Happine&s;s by propo&s;ing a Lady every way &s;o accompli&s;hed as Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt,</HI> for his Wife: but that it was impo&s;&s;ible he could think of offering him|&s;elf to her, or to any other Lady of Quality and Merit, while his Reputation &s;uffered un|der infamous Calumnies, that made him un|worthy of the Honour of her Alliance.</P>
<P><Q>You mu&s;t permit me, Mon&s;ieur, &s;aid he, to return to Court: and when I have cleared my Fame, and regained my for|mer un&s;ullied Character, I may then with|out
<PB N="17" REF="18">
Pre&s;umption pretend to the Honour of calling &s;uch an amiable young Lady, as Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt</HI> mine.</Q></P>
<P>The old Marquis felt the Force of the&s;e Rea&s;ons; he &s;aw the Propriety of &s;uch a Conduct as his Nephew &s;eemed re&s;olved to follow, and although he had &s;ome Su&s;picion that he had not yet forgot the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> yet he would not give any Hint of Di&s;tru&s;t, le&s;t it &s;hould oblige him to come to Extremeties with the Chevalier whom he loved with a truly paternal Tenderne&s;s. All he required therefore of him, was, that he &s;hould vi&s;it Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt</HI> as often as Decorum would permit, while he continued in <HI>Ga&s;cony.</HI> The Chevalier's ready Compliance with his Reque&s;t &s;o charmed the old Man, that he was the fir&s;t to ha&s;ten his Departure for the Court, in order that eve|ry Ob&s;tacle to his Marriage might be re|moved.</P>
<P>Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt</HI> placing the Chevalier's frequent Vi&s;its to the Score of her own irre&s;i&s;table Charms, made no Efforts to conquer the Pa&s;&s;ion &s;he felt for him, and which every new Sight of him increa&s;ed. She might indeed have ju&s;tly wondered that he had not taken Advantage of any of tho&s;e Opportunities he had been favoured with, to declare his Pa&s;&s;ion; but Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt</HI> ea&s;ily accounted to her&s;elf for his Silence upon that Head. Haughty as &s;he
<PB N="18" REF="19">
was, and well acquainted with the Power of her own Beauty, &s;he concluded that the Di&s;dain &s;he had hitherto &s;hewn to all tho&s;e who had pre&s;umed to addre&s;s her, was the true Cau&s;e of the Chevalier's Re&s;erve; and that re&s;pectful Awe and Fear of offending to which &s;he imputed his not declaring his Sentiments, &s;trengthened the Chevalier's In|tere&s;t in her Heart, more perhaps, than the mo&s;t tender Prote&s;tations could have done.</P>
<P>Thus willingly deceived, &s;he heard the News of the Chevalier's intended Journey to Court without much Regret, as &s;he looked upon it as a nece&s;&s;ary Preparative to her Nuptials: and when he came to take Leave of her, did not fail to attribute to his Eyes a dying Langui&s;hment, faltering Accents to his Tongue, and tender Sorrow to his whole Countenance and Behaviour.</P>
<P>The Chevalier, indeed, parted with his Uncle with great Concern, con&s;cious of the Hopes with which the good old Man flat|tered him&s;elf at his promi&s;ed Return: he look|ed upon him&s;elf as acting an ungenerous Part, but he &s;oon repre&s;t the unea&s;y Sen&s;ations this Thought gave Ri&s;e to, by the Con&s;ideration that he had made no Promi&s;e to his Uncle, or been guilty of any Thing that could in Reality be called an Eva&s;ion, but only by avoiding an expre&s;s Denial, held him in Su&s;pen&s;e with Regard to his Con&s;ent. And now as he pur&s;ued his Journey to <HI>Burgundy,</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="20">
where he expected to find his beloved Coun|te&s;s, the Raptures he indulged in the Hope of &s;oon &s;eeing her, bani&s;hed every unea&s;y Reflexion from his Mind.</P>
<P>On his Arrival at <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> he heard that a celebrated Tournament was to be held in <HI>England:</HI> he could not re&s;i&s;t this Opportu|nity of increa&s;ing his Fame, and fancied that by adding new Lawrels to tho&s;e he had already gained, he &s;hould appear with greater Advantages in the Eyes of his charming Mi&s;tre&s;s, and with higher Dignity in tho&s;e of all <HI>France,</HI> when he came to defend his Honour and a&s;&s;ert his Innocence. He re|&s;olved, therefore, to defer his Journey to <HI>Burgundy</HI> for &s;ome Days, and having wrote a tender Letter to the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> he di&s;patched the Turnkey, whom he had made his Valet de Chambre, with it to the Ca&s;tle of the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> where he thought his Mi&s;tre&s;s &s;till was, and with his other Dome&s;ticks embarked for <HI>England,</HI> where he arrived &s;afe &s;oon after.</P>
<P>The Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> had left <HI>Ga&s;cony</HI> but two Days when the young Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> arrived there. He alighted at the Ca&s;tle of the old Marquis <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> and was received by that Nobleman at fir&s;t with &s;ome Coolne&s;s, his Nephew's Troubles on that Family's Account being all in his Head. The Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> after the fir&s;t Compliments, inquired for the Che|valier,
<PB N="20" REF="21">
and being told that he had left the Province two Days before, he proceeded to acquaint the old Marquis with the Steps which his Friends had taken in his Favour at Court. He told him, that his Father had obtained the Chevalier's Pardon of the King for the Death of the Count of <HI>Polan,</HI> upon Condition that within a Month he pre&s;ented him&s;elf at <HI>Paris</HI> to clear him&s;elf of the Count of <HI>Berci</HI>'s Murder: that his Father had im|mediately di&s;patched a Gentleman to <HI>Ga&s;co|ny</HI> with a Letter informing the Chevalier of the King's Decree, but had received no An&s;wer, and the Me&s;&s;enger never returned: that the King had had the Goodne&s;s to grant him three Weeks longer, after which no farther Delay could be hoped for; and that, if he did not appear within that Time, he would be declared duly convicted of the Murder of which he was accu&s;ed.</P>
<P><Q>All <HI>France,</HI> added the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> which has been filled with the Fame of your Nephew's great Actions, a&s;toni&s;hed at his not appearing to defend his Innocence, begin already to conclude him guilty. His Friends can no longer form Excu&s;es for him; and all that re|mains for them to do, is to pre&s;ent them|&s;elves on the la&s;t Day pre&s;cribed for the Combat to fight his Accu&s;ers in his Stead. But what Di&s;grace will this reflect upon the Chevalier, that in the Pre&s;ence of the greate&s;t King in the World, who has con|&s;ented
<PB N="21" REF="22">
to this extraordinary Method of trying his Cau&s;e, his Friends &s;hould ex|po&s;e their Lives for his Defence, while he remains in a &s;hameful Security in the Heart of <HI>Ga&s;cony.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The Marquis <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> was charmed with the friendly Freedom of the&s;e Remon|&s;trances: he was convinced that his Nephew had great Obligations to the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> and recollected with Grief and Confu&s;ion the cool Reception he had given a gallant young Nobleman, who had taken &s;o long a Journey for his Nephew's In|tere&s;ts: he now embraced him with great Affection, expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t Sen&s;e of the Favours the Chevalier had received from his Father, and of his own friendly Zeal in coming &s;o far in Search of him. He a&s;&s;ured him, that his Nephew had &s;et out for Court two Days before, and did not doubt but he would appear there in Time to redeem his own Honour, and &s;pare his Friends the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of defending his Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> was over|joyed to hear that the Chevalier was gone to <HI>Paris.</HI> He complied with Mon&s;ieur <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI>' earne&s;t Invitation to &s;tay one Night at his Ca&s;tle; but could not be prevailed upon for any more. He was re&s;olved, how|ever, not to leave <HI>Ga&s;cony</HI> without &s;eeing the celebrated Amazon, who&s;e Charms had obliterated the Memory of his Si&s;ter in the
<PB N="22" REF="23">
Chevalier's Heart. He de&s;ired the Marquis <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> to introduce him to her; which he readily did the next Day. The Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> lavi&s;hed &s;o many Enco|miums on Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt,</HI> that the old Nobleman thought him&s;elf well re|warded for the little Journey he had taken to procure him the Sight of her. Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> and he, parted with mu|tual Prote&s;tations of Affection and E&s;teem. The Marquis <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> returned to his Ca&s;tle, and <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> pur&s;ued his Road to <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing now was talked of but the fa|mous Tournament that was to be held in <HI>England.</HI> The young Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> catched the Contagion of the Times, and re&s;olved to embrace this Opportunity of &s;hewing his Valour and Dexterity. He wrote Letters to his Father and to his Wife, ex|cu&s;ing his Ab&s;ence a few Weeks longer: and being quite ea&s;y with regard to the Cheva|lier, who, he was a&s;&s;ured, was upon his Way to <HI>Paris,</HI> he embarked at <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> as his Friend had done a &s;hort Time before him, and arrived in <HI>England</HI> eight Days before the holding of the Tournament.</P>
<P>Mean Time the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> had taken private Lodgings in <HI>London,</HI> and a&s;|&s;umed another Name: he gave Orders for a Suit of Armour to be made of the Colour of A&s;hes, &s;prinkled with &s;ilver Lilies, &s;igni|fying
<PB N="23" REF="24">
that he &s;till had Rea&s;ons for concealing the Flames of his Love. His Devi&s;e was a Cupid in the Mid&s;t of a Pile, kindled by a Lady, with this Motto:
<Q>He burns continually without being con|&s;umed.</Q>
He had a Plume of white Feathers on his Ca&s;que. His Coat of Arms and the Furni|ture of his Hor&s;e were of the &s;ame Colour, embroidered with Silver. Had the too cre|dulous and unhappy Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> &s;een her Lover in this Equipage, her jealous Tor|ments would have been changed into the &s;ofte&s;t Tran&s;ports of Love and Gratitude, to &s;ee every Symbol of his my&s;terious Arms expre&s;&s;ive of the Misfortunes he &s;uffered upon her Account, and a Con&s;tancy which tho&s;e Misfortunes could not &s;hake.</P>
<P>The Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> on his Arrival, cau&s;ed Armour to be made for him covered with bright Flames. On his Shield was repre&s;ented the God of Marriage, hold|ing a Lady of inchanting Beauty, tied with Bands of interweaved Lilies and Ro&s;es, with this Motto:
<Q>Contented with the &s;oft Bondage.</Q>
His Plume of Feathers was Flame-Colour, and his Coat of Arms and Hor&s;e's Furniture Flame-Colour likewi&s;e, richly embroidered with Gold.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="25">This magnificent Tournament, which was to la&s;t three Days, began before our Frenchmen's Armour was fini&s;hed, and this Delay mortified them extremely. By the Laws of the Tournament the Knights were to ju&s;t with each other, with Lances tipped with Iron. He who fell in the Tilting, was not permitted to demand the Combat with the Sword: but if both the Combattants fell to the Ground, or if it happened that, after having broke two or three Lances again&s;t each other, they remained firm on their Hor&s;es, in that Ca&s;e they had a Right to demand the Combat with the Sword. If it happened al&s;o, that the Challengers &s;hould be wor&s;ted by their Antagoni&s;ts, the Victors were to take the Place of tho&s;e whom they had vanqui&s;hed, and were to challenge all Comers; and this Method was to be ob|&s;erved till the End of the Tournament. Such were the Laws which a Herald at Arms, by the King's Orders, publi&s;hed with Sound of Trumpet, the Evening before the Tournament. The Prize, which was to be be&s;towed by this Prince, was a Sword of great Value and Antiquity, being that which had been wore by the renowned King <HI>Arthur,</HI> and likewi&s;e a Chain of rich Jewels. The Knight, who &s;hould remain victorious, was to receive the Sword from the Hands of the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and the Chain from tho&s;e of the young Prince&s;s of <HI>England.</HI> It was this Prince&s;s who afterwards was married to a Count <HI>Palatin</HI> of the <HI>Rhine.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26">The King and the whole Court being &s;eated on Scaffolds prepared for them, the Trumpets &s;ounded, and immediately four Engli&s;h Lords of great Eminence entered the Li&s;ts as Challengers. Nothing could be more magnificent than their Arms and Equi|pages. They were followed by four other Engli&s;hmen habited like Turks, with Tur|bans on their Heads, Lances in their Hands, and Scymitars at their Sides. After the&s;e la&s;t had rode round the Li&s;ts, they placed them&s;elves oppo&s;ite to the Challengers, and at the Signal given by the Trumpets, the eight Knights ran again&s;t each other with &s;uch Impetuo&s;ity that their Lances were &s;hivered in Pieces: the four Turks were thrown to the Ground this fir&s;t Cour&s;e, to the great Joy of the Spectators, who filled the Air with their Acclamations. More than thirty A&s;&s;ailants, who &s;ucce&s;&s;ively pre|&s;ented them&s;elves, found the &s;ame Fate, while the Challengers at mo&s;t only lo&s;t a Stirrup, or had &s;ome &s;light Accident; &s;o that during the re&s;t of that Day no one was bold enough to encounter with &s;uch redoutable Adver&s;aries: they left the Field victorious and triumphant, amid&s;t the Sound of war|like In&s;truments and Acclamations of all the admiring Spectators.</P>
<P>The next Day, as &s;oon as the four Chal|lengers had taken their Places, two Strangers, who&s;e noble Mien &s;eemed to promi&s;e great Bravery, appeared at the other End of the
<PB N="26" REF="27">
Li&s;ts. One of them was in blue Armour, and the other in green. Two of the four Challengers immediately advanced to receive them. They lowered their Lances one again&s;t another, and met with &s;o fierce a Shock, that tho&s;e of the two Challengers being &s;hivered to Pieces, they were thrown off their Hor&s;es, and the two Strangers fi|ni&s;hed their Carieer without being moved, to the great A&s;toni&s;hment of the whole A&s;|&s;embly. The two others who remained, &s;eeing their Companions thus put out of the Combat, advanced full of a noble Rage to revenge the Shame of their Defeat. They turned their Arms immediately upon the A&s;&s;ailants, and all four performed one of the fine&s;t Cour&s;es imaginable. However, they could not avoid being thrown out of their Saddles as the others had been; and the two Strangers, who had vanqui&s;hed the four Engli&s;hmen, of A&s;&s;ailants, became Chal|lengers, and took their Places accordingly. All the Knights, who pre&s;ented them&s;elves during the re&s;t of the Day, were vanqui&s;hed with &s;till le&s;s Difficulty than the former. Night put an End to the Ju&s;ting, and the Victors went out of the Field with the &s;ame Pomp and the &s;ame. Acclamations, as had honoured the Triumph of the Conquerors the preceding Day.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>England,</HI> being de&s;irous to know who the&s;e two brave Men were, &s;ent &s;ome of his Courtiers to a&s;k them their
<PB N="27" REF="28">
Names and Country. But they intreated his Maje&s;ty's Pardon for not complying with his Reque&s;t till the Tournament was ended, when they would not fail to pay their Re|&s;pects to him and take his Orders.</P>
<P>All this pa&s;&s;ed before the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> could get his Armour. He was in terrible Unea&s;ine&s;s, le&s;t he &s;hould be pre|vented from &s;ignali&s;ing him&s;elf in this Tour|nament, and a thou&s;and times cur&s;t the Workman's Delay: at length on the third Day, and before the Li&s;ts were opened, his Armour was brought: he put it on imme|diately, and appeared among the fir&s;t in the Field; but with &s;uch a noble Fiercene&s;s in his Air and Mien, that he &s;oon drew the Eyes of the whole A&s;&s;embly upon him.</P>
<P>The two Challengers of the Day before, &s;eeing him advance towards them, judged by his Appearance that he would give them Exerci&s;e enough; and each choo&s;ing a very &s;trong Lance, they prepared to re&s;i&s;t his Ef|forts. The Knight in green Armour fir&s;t advanced towards him, and in the Middle of the Cour&s;e met the Chevalier, who came pouring upon him like a Whirlwind: their Lances were &s;hivered to pieces on each other's Ca&s;que, and they fini&s;hed their Career with|out any Advantage being gained on either Side, which had never happened &s;ince the be|ginning of the Tournament. New Lances being brought them, they ran again&s;t each
<PB N="28" REF="29">
other a &s;econd time, but with more Force and Fury than the former. The Echoes on the Shores of <HI>Thames</HI> reverberated the Sound of their redoubled Blows, and the Acclama|tions of the admiring Spectators. The Che|valier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> lo&s;t a Stirrup, and by the Vi|gour of his Adver&s;ary was obliged to &s;toop even to his Saddle-bow: but the other at the &s;ame In&s;tant was thrown with &s;uch Force to the Earth, that it was with great Diffi|culty he was able to ri&s;e again; immediate|ly the Air was filled with joyful Acclama|tions which celebrated the fir&s;t Triumph of our Hero.</P>
<P>The Knight in blue Armour, impatient to repair the Di&s;grace of him with whom he had acquired &s;o much Glory the pre|ceding Day, advanced immediately to meet the Chevalier. The whole A&s;&s;embly, in an uninterrupted Silence, kept their Eyes fixed upon the two Warriors. They met with equal Impetuo&s;ity, and ran three times again&s;t each other, without being &s;haken in their Saddles, to the great A&s;toni&s;hment of the Spectators, who were charmed with the No|velty of &s;uch a Combat. Each having broke three Lances, they had Recour&s;e to their Swords. And if in ju&s;ting they had di&s;co|vered uncommon Skill and Strength, in this fierce Conflict they gave Proofs of the mo&s;t exalted Valour. The Chevalier, mad with Rage to &s;ee a Man again&s;t whom he had broke three Lances, &s;till firm in his Saddle,
<PB N="29" REF="30">
aimed &s;o &s;ure a Stroke at him and with &s;uch Force, that he made &s;ome Pieces of his Ar|mour fly off: his Adver&s;ary, re&s;uming new Courage from the Di&s;dain he felt that &s;uch an Advantage had been gained over him, redoubled his Efforts, and took ample Ven|geance on the Chevalier. The Spectators were &s;eized with Horror at a Combat &s;o ob&s;tinate and fierce; it had already la&s;ted more than an Hour, while neither of them had &s;topped to take Breath. Their Hor&s;es were covered with Sweat and Du&s;t, and the Blood ran down from &s;everal Places.</P>
<P>The Chevalier, now perceiving that the Strength of his Antagoni&s;t began to fail, re|treated a few Steps back, and &s;poke to him in this Manner:
<Q>Noble Unknown, your Valour is greater than mine, although I have been more &s;ucce&s;sful than you: there|fore, &s;ince Fortune has openly declared in my Favour, content your&s;elf with having given &s;uch noble Proofs of Courage, and &s;uffer our Conte&s;t to end. I e&s;teem and admire you for your heroic Valour; and it would fill me with Grief, if &s;o brave a Man &s;hould by my Sword lo&s;e a Life which I would pre&s;erve with the Hazard of my own.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Whoever you are, replied the Unknown, I return you Thanks for your Civility: but do not imagine that I will yield the Ho|nour of this Day but with my Life; and
<PB N="30" REF="31">
I will &s;ell it dearly.</Q>
The Combat was now renewed with more Fury than before: but it was ea&s;ily perceived, that the Knight in blue Armour was greatly weakened, and that, although he di&s;covered amazing Cou|rage and Re&s;olution, yet it was with Diffi|culty he kept his Ground: but the Che|valier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> always equal to him|&s;elf, &s;hewed by his unabated Strength and Vigour, that Victory, after having &s;o long balanced between him and the brave Un|known, was going to declare for him, and that, together with the Prize, the Glory of this celebrated Tournament would be his.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h Monarch, charmed with the Valour of the&s;e Rivals, commanded the Judges of the Field to &s;eparate them, that the Triumph of the Victor might not be &s;ullied with the Death of the worthy Rival of his Glory, nor &s;o noble a Solemnity be &s;tained with an Event &s;o tragical. He af|terwards decreed a Prize to be given to the four fir&s;t Challengers who had been Victors the fir&s;t Day, and another for the two Strangers who had triumphed the &s;econd Day: the fir&s;t Prize of all he re&s;erved for our Hero, in ca&s;e he &s;hould not be van|qui&s;hed by &s;ome other Knight before the End of the Day.</P>
<P>The whole A&s;&s;embly, a&s;toni&s;hed at the great Actions performed by the Chevalier, could not believe that any Per&s;on would be
<PB N="31" REF="32">
daring enough to pre&s;ent them&s;elves to fight with &s;o redoutable an Antagoni&s;t, but they were deceived: the brave Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> waited with an extreme Impatience for the End of the Combat that he might offer him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> having quitted the Judges who &s;eparated him and his Ad|ver&s;ary, remained now &s;ole Challenger: the Marquis going up to him, &s;aluted him with great Re&s;pect; and ob&s;erving that his Ar|mour was all hacked, and his Hor&s;e and him&s;elf all covered with Sweat and Du&s;t,
<Q>Brave Stranger, &s;aid he, it is with Re|luctance that impelled by the De&s;ire of Fame I demand the Combat with you: You who have but ju&s;t fini&s;hed one in which you have acquired &s;o much Glory, while I bring to the Field a Body not weakened by Fatigue, and Armour un|pierced. But if you will be &s;o generous as to join your Intreaties with mine, we will endeavour to prevail upon the Engli&s;h Monarch to give us &s;ome di&s;tant Day, in order that you may recruit your Strength, and meet me with le&s;s Di&s;advantage.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Sir, replied the Chevalier, I am obliged to you for your good Intention; but, thank Heaven! I do not find my&s;elf &s;o much fa|tigued, but that I can accept the Honour you de&s;ign me now.</Q>
At the&s;e Words they engaged, and a noble Combat en&s;ued.
<PB N="32" REF="33">
Victory &s;tood &s;u&s;pended for more than half an Hour, and the Chevalier was &s;o hard pre&s;&s;ed by this brave Rival, that the A&s;&s;em|bly was full of Fear, le&s;t he &s;hould lo&s;e at la&s;t the Honour of the Day. But at length a lucky Stroke, which fell with unre&s;i&s;ted Force on the Neck of the Marquis, threw him off his Hor&s;e, and at the &s;ame Time his Ca&s;que fell off likewi&s;e, the Strings having been cut by the &s;ame Stroke. The two Strangers, who had been vanqui&s;hed by the Chevalier, and had &s;taid in the Field to view the Combat, in&s;tantly knew the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> and ran to hinder his Anta|goni&s;t from making U&s;e of the Advantage he had over him. But he was ri&s;en before they came to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and the Che|valier, who now knew him al&s;o, was &s;eized with Grief for the Victory he had gained over the Brother of his Mi&s;tre&s;s. He cho&s;e rather to lo&s;e the Prize of the Tournament which he had &s;o nobly won, than di&s;cover him&s;elf to the Marquis, and re&s;olved to withdraw that Moment, &s;uppo&s;ing that it would be adjudged to him who &s;taid la&s;t in the Field. But before he went away, he re|turned him his Sword, which the Marquis had let fall, and he had taken up.</P>
<P><Q>Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> &s;aid he, I ought to have known you by the Marks you gave of your Valour, before I di&s;co|vered your Face, and to have voluntarily abandoned to you an Honour which I now

&s;ee my&s;elf con&s;trained to yield to your Victory, for you are &s;till un&s;ubdued. Enjoy then your Glory and the Prize due to your Virtue, which I honour and love; and be per&s;uaded that I have no le&s;s Regret at having di&s;puted it with you, than Ardour for your Service.</Q></P>
<P>Saying this, without waiting for any An&s;wer from the Marquis, who was in the utmo&s;t A&s;toni&s;hment at a Genero&s;ity &s;o un|exampled, he mounted his Hor&s;e, and war going out of the Field, but the Marquis &s;topping him eagerly,
<Q>No, Sir, &s;aid he, I will not &s;uffer you to triumph over me this Way. I have no Preten&s;ions to gather tho&s;e Laurels you have watered with your Blood, nor to enjoy the Prize you have merited by &s;uch heroic Valour. I con|jure you do not &s;eek to cover me with Shame and Confu&s;ion, by re&s;igning to me an Honour due only to your&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>The Judges approaching them, and great Crowds of Spectators preiling round them, the Chevalier found it impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;cape, 'I prote&s;t (&s;aid he to the Marquis, alighting from his Hor&s;e)
<Q>again&s;t the Violence you do me; and I will continue here only to accompany you in your Triumph.</Q>
With the&s;e Words he took off his Ca&s;que, and threw him&s;elf into the Arms of the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> who, tran&s;ported with Joy and Wonder, cla&s;ped him clo&s;e to his Brea&s;t,
<PB N="34" REF="35">
<Q>Ah! my dear Friend, cried he, and would you thus have &s;tolen your&s;elf away from a Man who loves you with &s;o much Ten|derne&s;s, and fly from one that has &s;o anxiou&s;ly &s;ought you.</Q>
The two Strangers now advanced, and taking off their Ca&s;ques di&s;covered them&s;elves to be the Chevalier <HI>de Morigny</HI> and the young Count of <HI>Berci:</HI> they all four embraced expre&s;&s;ing, the highe&s;t Joy at this unexpected Meeting.</P>
<P>But now the Judges of the Field inter|rupted their mutual Embraces to lead them to the King's Scaffold. They all threw them&s;elves at the Feet of this Monarch, who gave them the Prai&s;es due to their Valour, although it was apparent that he &s;aw with Regret the Glory of that Day carried off from his own Subjects by a rival Nation.</P>
<P>The Prince and Prince&s;s were ju&s;t going to pre&s;ent the Prize to the Chevalier, who kneeled to receive it, when another Knight appeared in the Li&s;ts, and riding ha&s;tily up to the King's Scaffold, alighted from his Hor&s;e and threw him&s;elf at his Maje&s;ty's Feet,
<Q>Permit one of your own Subjects, my gracious Lord, &s;aid he, to demand the Combat with this brave Warrior before you be&s;tow the Prize. There is &s;till Day enough left to redeem the Honour of our Nation; if not, Night can not come too to cover our Di&s;grace.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="36">The whole A&s;&s;embly, who had with Shame and Grief beheld the Victory in the Hands of the French, &s;ent forth loud Accla|mations of Joy at this generous Reque&s;t. The King's Eyes &s;parkled with Plea&s;ure, but apprehen&s;ive that the French Noblemen might think them&s;elves injured, if, after having the Victory adjudged to them, he &s;hould permit it to be again di&s;puted, he re|mained &s;ilent and pen&s;ive, unwilling to re|fu&s;e and unre&s;olved to grant. The Cheva|lier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> perceiving his Embarra&s;s|ment, ha&s;tened to relieve him from it, 'Great Prince,' &s;aid he, advancing towards him,
<Q>the Laws of the Tournament will not be violated by granting the Reque&s;t of this Knight. The Hours which remain of this Day are more than &s;ufficient to trans|fer the Glory of it to him, if Fortune &s;o plea&s;es, or to &s;ecure it to me by his Defeat.</Q></P>
<P>Saying this, and without waiting for the King's An&s;wer, he mounted his Hor&s;e and was preparing to enter the Li&s;ts, when the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> and his three other illu&s;trious Friends all at once &s;eizing the Bridle, &s;topped him and declared, that they would fir&s;t try the Force of this Engli&s;h Knight; and if they were overcome, they &s;hould have this Con&s;olation in their Di&s;|grace that he was &s;till re&s;erved to redeem their Fame. The Chevalier with Reluctance yielded to the Arguments of his Friends, and
<PB N="36" REF="37">
then a generous Conte&s;t en&s;ued between them who &s;hould fir&s;t engage the Engli&s;h Champion: but the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sau|veur</HI>'s Claim was generally admitted, as he had entered the Li&s;ts la&s;t.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h Knight, who had waited with Impatience for the End of their Con|te&s;t, now approached and told the Cheva|lier, That, although he &s;hould be fortunate enough to vanqui&s;h his Countrymen, yet he did not doubt but their Valour would leave him in &s;uch a Condition, that he might with le&s;s Shame engage with him, who had &s;u&s;tained their fir&s;t Efforts.</P>
<P>The Knights now took their Stands, the Judges of the Field re&s;umed their Places, the King and the whole Court &s;at attentive to the approaching Combat, and the whole A&s;&s;embly with beating Hearts and anxious Impatience expected the Event. At length the Trumpets &s;ounded, the Engli&s;h Knight and the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> &s;purred forward with equal Fury, but with different Succe&s;s. The Marquis was thrown out of his Saddle, and the Engli&s;h Knight fini&s;hed his Career without being moved in his Seat.</P>
<P>This fir&s;t Omen of Victory was received with loud Shouts of Joy. The young Count of <HI>Berci</HI> immediately prepared to run again&s;t the Vanqui&s;her, and taking a Lance out of
<PB N="37" REF="38">
the Chevalier's Hands,
<Q>May this be pro|pitious to me!</Q>
&s;aid he; and &s;purring forwards, &s;truck it with &s;uch Force on the Ca&s;que of the Engli&s;h Knight that it &s;hi|vered in Pieces, but received at the &s;ame Time &s;uch a weighty Blow from his Hand, that, after reeling a Moment in his Saddle, he fell to the Ground, &s;o &s;tunned both with the Blow and the Fall, that he was not able to ri&s;e without Help.</P>
<P>A &s;econd time the Shouts of the ravi&s;hed Engli&s;h celebrated the Victory, and gave new Spirits to their brave Champion. Shame and Indignation filled the Minds of the Che|valier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> and <HI>Morigny;</HI> &s;carce could the former re&s;train his Impetuo&s;ity and hin|der him&s;elf from ru&s;hing to meet this re|doutable Foe: but he would not invade the Right of his Friend, who having now re|ceived a Lance from the Judges of the Field, &s;ettled him&s;elf firm in his Saddle, and all collected in his Strength, advanced to the Encounter. The Lances a Moment after were &s;een to &s;hiver in Pieces with the Vio|lence of their Strokes, but both kept their Seats and fini&s;hed their Career with equal Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>This Equality gave the Engli&s;h &s;ome little Unea&s;ine&s;s. A Pau&s;e in the good Fortune of their Hero was not what they expected. The Heart, elated by Succe&s;s, extravagant in its Wi&s;hes, and vain in its Hopes, is the
<PB N="38" REF="39">
more expo&s;ed to Di&s;appointments, and ag|gravates the &s;lighte&s;t Lo&s;s.</P>
<P>The Judges of the Field having put two other Lances in the Hands of the Comba|tants, again they met, again the faithle&s;s Weapons eluded their Rage, and &s;pending their harmle&s;s Force upon each other's Armour, &s;hi|vered again to Pieces with the Strokes: they tried a third, and &s;till with the &s;ame Succe&s;s. And now the furious Warriors had Recour&s;e to the Sword: in one In&s;tant they both alighted. The Engli&s;h Knight received a Wound in his left Arm, and the Blood was &s;een to &s;tream down his Armour: but the Chevalier <HI>de Morigny,</HI> eager to &s;econd his Blow, ru&s;hed forwards with &s;uch Impetuo|&s;ity upon his Antagoni&s;t, that he received the Point of his Sword full in his right Side, and &s;taggering with the Pain, his Weapon for&s;ook his Hand, and he fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s at the Feet of his Conqueror.</P>
<P>At this Sight the A&s;&s;embly rent the Air with their joyful Acclamations. The Mar|quis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> and the Count of <HI>Ber|ci,</HI> full of Grief and Con&s;ternation, ran to rai&s;e their fallen Friend: mean Time the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> advanced with a ge|nerous Indignation to meet the Victor, who was now remounted and ready to receive him. The loud Applau&s;es of the Spectators were now converted into a &s;ilent Attention. This la&s;t Combat was to decide the Con|que&s;t,
<PB N="39" REF="40">
and give the Glory of the Tourna|ment to their own Countryman, or transfer all the Laurels he had gained to the victo|rious Frenchman. Both brought an equal Ardour to the Combat; both were &s;timu|lated by a Motive equally great and generous, the Honour of their &s;everal Nations.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h &s;ent forth a loud Shout, when they &s;aw their Champion bound from his Po&s;t and ru&s;h like a Whirlwind upon his Foe: but the Chevalier received him firmly in his Saddle, and without being the lea&s;t moved by his furious On&s;et, pre&s;ented his Shield to the flying Lance on which it broke to Pieces, at the &s;ame darting his own at his Antagoni&s;t which hit him with &s;uch Force that he reeled in his Saddle, lo&s;t a Stirrup, and with Difficulty kept him&s;elf from falling. The Engli&s;h turned pale with Fear at this Advantage, while the Friends of the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> who knew the Greatne&s;s of his Strength and Courage, be|held it with a Confidence that &s;hewed they were &s;ecure of Victory. In the &s;econd Career the Engli&s;h Knight lo&s;t a Stirrup again: but the Chevalier was &s;o rudely &s;haken that he was &s;een to &s;toop even to his Saddle bow. However, the third fini&s;hed the Conte&s;t, to the utmo&s;t Glory of the Engli&s;h Champion, who run &s;o furiou&s;ly again&s;t the Chevalier, that with the Vio|lence of the Shock he was thrown to the Ground. The Air re&s;ounded with the rap|turous
<PB N="40" REF="41">
Acclamations of the whole A&s;&s;embly, when the Victor alighting from his Hor&s;e, approached his brave Rival, who had lightly leaped from the Ground almo&s;t as &s;oon as he fell.</P>
<P><Q>Noble Sir, &s;aid he with, a graceful Mo|de&s;ty, as I entered the Li&s;ts only to re|deem the Honour of my Countrymen, I pretend not to the Prize of the Tourna|ment which your Valour has well de|&s;erved, and I di&s;claim all other Prai&s;e, but that of being found equal to you, who have &s;o bravely maintained the Honour of your Nation.</Q></P>
<P>The Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> charmed with his Genero&s;ity and Politene&s;s, took his Hand and pre&s;&s;ing it between his,
<Q>There is no Di&s;grace in being vanqui&s;hed by &s;o brave an Enemy, &s;aid he; the Prize as well as the Glory of this Day, are due only to you.</Q></P>
<P>The Judges of the Field approaching, they led the Victor to the King's Scaffold. That Monarch, tran&s;ported with Joy that the Glory of this Tournament had been pre|&s;erved to his own Subjects, and full of Ad|miration for the Valour of this Briti&s;h Hero, de&s;cended two or three Steps that he might rai&s;e him with his own Hand. The noble Victor taking off his Ca&s;que, the &s;ame In&s;tant, made him&s;elf known to be the
<PB N="41" REF="42">
brave Earl of <HI>Selkirk.</HI> The King felt an Increa&s;e of Plea&s;ure, when he found that his own Country had produced this bloom|ing Champion, and after having honoured him with an affectionate Embrace, he com|manded the young Prince&s;s his Daughter to bind the Chain of Jewels on his Neck with her own Hands, and the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> him&s;elf girded on the Sword, making him at the &s;ame Time a graceful Complement on his Courage and Skill. All this While the Air re&s;ounded with the joyful Acclama|tions of the whole A&s;&s;embly, and the Name of <HI>Selkirk</HI> was &s;houted by ten thou&s;and dif|ferent Tongues at once.</P>
<P>The Victor, di&s;covering a little Confu&s;ion at &s;uch loud Applau&s;e, took Occa&s;ion to mention the gallant Frenchmen, extolling in the highe&s;t Terms the Genero&s;ity and Politene&s;s of the la&s;t Challenger. The King immediately di&s;patched the Judges of the Field to the four brave Frenchmen, who were engaged in a tender and intere&s;ting Conver&s;ation, with his Reque&s;t that they would come to his Scaffold. Accordingly they followed the Judges, and kneeling ki&s;&s;ed the Hand of the Briti&s;h Monarch, who, after giving great Prai&s;es to their Valour, pre|&s;ented each of them with a fine Hor&s;e with rich Furniture, and a Chain of Gold with a large Medal of the &s;ame Metal, on which was engraved his own Portrait: and under|&s;tanding that the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> was in
<PB N="42" REF="43">
Di&s;grace in his own Court, he offered him a very large Pen&s;ion, if he would enter in|to his Service, which the Chevalier politely refu&s;ed, as he had done the Archduke when he made the &s;ame Offer to him: but ex|pre&s;&s;ed at the &s;ame Time the highe&s;t Ac|knowledgement for the Honour his Maje&s;ty did him.</P>
<P>But it is now Time to account to the Reader for the accidental. Meeting of the young Count of <HI>Berci,</HI> and the Chevalier <HI>de Morigny,</HI> at the celebrated Engli&s;h Tourna|ment. The Count of <HI>Berci,</HI> after having travelled through all <HI>Germany, Switzerland</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> in Search of <HI>Verague,</HI> came at length to <HI>Holland,</HI> where he was not more &s;ucce&s;sful: tired out with his fruitle&s;s Search, he determined to go to <HI>England,</HI> and if he did not meet with this A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in there to re|turn directly to <HI>France.</HI> The Chevalier <HI>de Morigny</HI> was crui&s;ing near the Iri&s;h Seas in a Malte&s;e Galley, in order to give Chace to &s;ome Cor&s;airs, according to the Engage|ments of his Profe&s;&s;ion, when a violent Storm ca&s;t him upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>England.</HI> While his Ve&s;&s;el was refitting, he came to <HI>London,</HI> where he propo&s;ed to &s;tay a few Days to refre&s;h him&s;elf after the Dangers and Fatigues he had &s;uffered at Sea.</P>
<P>As he was walking one Day, examining the Buildings and other Things worthy of Curio&s;ity in that great City, he &s;aw a young
<PB N="43" REF="44">
Gentleman at a Di&s;tance, who he thought had greatly the Air and Look of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Berci,</HI> Brother to his Friend the Count, and as he approached nearer, he found it was really he. The Chevalier <HI>de Morigny</HI> ha&s;tily advanced to meet him, and embracing him, expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t Satisfaction at &s;o unexpected an Encounter. The Count, equally &s;urpri&s;ed and plea&s;ed at the Sight of the Chevalier, returned his Embrace with an affectionate Warmth. The Chevalier carried the Count home to his own Lodgings, and as he was not yet &s;ettled, obliged him to accept of an Apartment with him; after which they gave each other a mutual Ac|count of all that had happened to them &s;ince they la&s;t parted.</P>
<P>The unfortunate Death of the Count of <HI>Berci,</HI> which the Chevalier now fir&s;t heard of, drew Tears in great Abundance from his Eyes; he lamented the Sufferings of his injured Widow, and expre&s;&s;ed a generous Rage at the unworthy Su&s;picions which had been ca&s;t on the brave Chevalier <HI>des E&s;|&s;ars.</HI> The young Count of <HI>Berci,</HI> who&s;e Eyes had overflowed at the melancholy Re|cital of his Brother's Fate, proceeded to ac|quaint the Chevalier <HI>de Morigny</HI> with the Marriage of the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> and Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Montmartin,</HI> which was &s;o far from giving him any jealous Emotions, that he felt a &s;incere Joy for their Happine&s;s, which in &s;ome Mea&s;ure alleviated
<PB N="44" REF="45">
his Concern for the Misfortunes of the re&s;t of that Family.</P>
<P>The Preparations, which were then mak|ing all over <HI>London</HI> for the Tournament, in&s;pired the young Count of <HI>Berci</HI> with an eager De&s;ire to make one of the Comba|tants, and he earne&s;tly intreated the Cheva|lier <HI>de Morigny</HI> not to leave <HI>London</HI> without taking Advantage of this Opportunity to give &s;ome Proofs of that Valour which had already gained him &s;o great Reputation. The Chevalier, tho' fired at the Thoughts of di&s;tingui&s;hing him&s;elf at this Tourna|ment, yet objected the new Engagements of his Profe&s;&s;ion, which did not permit him to &s;eek o&s;tentatious Occa&s;ions of exerci&s;ing his Valour: but to employ it in the Service of Religion, and in revenging upon the In|fidels the Depredations and Cruelties they were daily committing upon tho&s;e Chri&s;tians who were &s;o unhappy as to fall into their Hands. The Count of <HI>Berci</HI> ea&s;ily found Arguments to an&s;wer all he could urge again&s;t his Reque&s;t, and the Chevalier &s;uf|fered him&s;elf to be per&s;uaded to what in|deed he was &s;ufficiently inclined of him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But we will now return to our four gal|lant Frenchmen, who as &s;oon as they re|tired to their Lodgings after the noble Ex|ploits of the Day, renewed their Embraces and tender Expre&s;&s;ions of Joy for a Meeting &s;o happy and &s;o unexpected, The Cheva|lier
<PB N="45" REF="46">
<HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> being now informed by the Marquis of the urgent Rea&s;ons which re|called him to the Court of <HI>France,</HI> re&s;olv|ed to wait on the King of <HI>England,</HI> to take Leave of him, and &s;et out in&s;tantly for <HI>Paris.</HI> But, it not being po&s;&s;ible for them to be introduced till after his Maje&s;ty had dined, they were obliged to moderate their Impatience. That Prince received them very graciou&s;ly, prai&s;ed their Valour in very high Terms, and obligingly expre&s;&s;ed his Concern that he could not detain &s;uch brave Men longer in his Court. A Servant of the Chevalier's having been di&s;patched to <HI>Dover,</HI> to hire a Packet-boat for their Pa&s;&s;age, they returned to their Lodgings, in order to have every Thing prepared for their De|parture the next Day.</P>
<P>They were ju&s;t going to &s;it down to Sup|per, when they were told that a French Gentleman, who &s;eemed to be in great Emotions, de&s;ired to be in&s;tantly introduced to them. They gave Orders for his Admit|tance, and he entered the Room imme|diately afterwards, but in&s;tead of declaring his Name and Bu&s;ine&s;s, as they all expec|ted, he threw him&s;elf at the Feet of the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> and bur&s;t into Tears.</P>
<P>The Chevalier, extremely &s;urpri&s;ed at this Action, endeavoured with great Gentlene&s;s to rai&s;e him, but to no purpo&s;e; he con|tinued &s;till kneeling, and &s;eemed unable to
<PB N="46" REF="47">
&s;peak through the Violence of his Emo|tions: at length he ventured to rai&s;e his Head; but his Eyes, which were drowned in Tears, had no &s;ooner encountered tho&s;e of the Chevalier, than he ha&s;tily withdrew them again, and his Head &s;inking upon his Bo&s;om, he gave Way to another Bur&s;t of Tears.</P>
<P>Mean time the Gentlemen, lo&s;t in A&s;to|ni&s;hment, &s;tared upon each other expecting &s;ome one would &s;peak and unfold the Mean|ing of &s;o &s;trange a Scene. The Chevalier again made an Attempt to rai&s;e the unhap|py Man from his Feet, when he with a &s;upplicating Look be&s;peaking his Attention, and a Voice low and trembling thus &s;poke:</P>
<P><Q>You &s;ee, Gentlemen, before you, a Wretch unworthy the Light of Heaven. Oh how can I tell you, who I am? How can I make the &s;hocking Recital of my Crimes? My Blood congeals with Horror at the Remembrance of what I have done, impelled by a blind Pa&s;&s;ion, and acting under the Influence of fal&s;e Honour. I have de&s;troyed my Soul: Terror and Re|mor&s;e have &s;eized me, in the Torments of my Con&s;cience, ever &s;ince the Perpe|tration of my Crime, I have too &s;ure an Earne&s;t of Damnation. Behold in me the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of the Count of <HI>Berci,</HI> I come to offer my&s;elf a voluntary Victim to your Vengeance, &s;trike, &s;trike, my Lord,</Q>
pur|&s;ued
<PB N="47" REF="48">
he to the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur;</HI> tearing open his Coat and extending his Arms,
<Q>&s;trike the Murderer of your Si&s;ter's Hu&s;band; or do you, mo&s;t noble, mo&s;t injured Gentleman, &s;aid he,</Q>
turning to the Chevalier,
<Q>you who&s;e &s;potle&s;s Fame has been blackened with my Deed, do you plunge your Sword into my Brea&s;t, and give me a Death too honourable for my De&s;ert. Alas! I acknowledge I ought to die in Torments for the Murder I have committed. I re&s;ign my&s;elf into your Hands; let me &s;uffer all the Rigour of the Law, I &s;hall then have this Satisfac|tion in my ju&s;tly merited Puni&s;hment, that I cleared your Innocence before I died.</Q></P>
<P>The pale, wan Countenance of the &s;elf-condemned, unhappy Wretch, his emaciated Body, the deep De&s;pair that &s;at on every Feature, and glared wild Horror in his Eyes, his mournful Action, altogether &s;o moved the Hearts of our generous French|men, that they felt hardly any other Emotions than tho&s;e of Pity for a Man who had been &s;o long the Subject of their Execrations, and whom they had re&s;olved to &s;acrifice to their ju&s;t Revenge. But the Chevalier, harden|ing his Heart by the Remembrance of his dear Counte&s;s's Sufferings, with a Stern|ne&s;s in his Voice and Eyes, that &s;truck Ter|ror to the Soul of the poor Criminal, though he &s;ought Death, cried:
<Q>Oh!
<PB N="48" REF="49">
Wretch, thy Hand deprived a brave and worthy Nobleman of Life, and brought Sorrow, Shame, Impri&s;onment and al|mo&s;t Death upon his Widow; a Wo|man who&s;e Virtues are a Glory to her Sex. What puni&s;hment can equal thy Crime?</Q></P>
<P>'Alas! Mon&s;ieur,' interrupted the wretched <HI>Verague,</HI> 'I carry my Puni&s;hment 'about me. Here (pur&s;ued he, vehemently &s;triking his Brea&s;t) do I feel my Hell be|gun.
<Q>But, alas! I did not kill the Count of <HI>Berci</HI> in Malice, nor did I mean to kill him. Anxious to pre&s;erve the Honour of a Woman I loved, and who had indeed intru&s;ted it to my keeping, I &s;truggled to free my&s;elf from the Count, who holding me fa&s;t, called aloud for Lights, in order to di&s;cover who I was; to prevent this, I aimed a Stroke at the Arm with which he held me, all I intended being to di&s;|able him; but he, alas! received it in his Side. I fled confounded with Fear and Guilt, but Angui&s;h and Remor&s;e pur|&s;ued me: that Life I had taken &s;uch guilty Pains to &s;ave, became in&s;upportable to me. All I wi&s;hed was to clear your Fame; and I re&s;olved to do it by deliver|ing my&s;elf up to Ju&s;tice. Full of the&s;e Thoughts, an Inclination which I had no Power to re&s;i&s;t, drew me to the Tourna|ment. Alas! I had no Eyes for Shew, no Ta&s;te for Diver&s;ion: but driven along
<PB N="49" REF="50">
by a &s;ecret Impul&s;e, I mixed with the Croud which &s;urrounded the Li&s;ts. I knew you all, Gentlemen, immediately upon your taking off your Ca&s;ques. Providence, I thought, concurred with my Wi&s;hes in affording me an Opportunity to &s;atisfy your Vengeance: I followed you hither, prepared to die by your Hands, or meet a more &s;evere Fate from tho&s;e Laws which I have &s;o greatly offended.</Q></P>
<P>The Chevalier, &s;en&s;ibly affected with &s;o &s;triking a Proof of Penitence and awakened Honour, would that Moment have rai&s;ed the unhappy Youth and bid him hope for Mer|cy, had he not thought it ju&s;t to leave him wholly in the Power of the Count of <HI>Berci</HI> and the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> who&s;e near Relation to the noble Decea&s;ed, gave them a better Right to di&s;po&s;e of the De&s;ti|ny of his Murderer. They perceived his Thoughts by the &s;upplicating Look he gave them, in Behalf of the wretched Offender; and both being greatly moved at the un|feigned Remor&s;e he di&s;covered, a&s;&s;entingly bowed to the Chevalier, who then rai&s;ed the unhappy Criminal, and giving him a compa&s;&s;ionate Look, which penetrated to his Heart,
<Q>You have, &s;aid he, by thus vo|luntarily delivering your&s;elf into our Hands, given &s;o convincing a Proof of your Penitence, that we cannot doubt of the Truth of tho&s;e Circum&s;tances which you alledge in Extenuation of your Guilt.
<PB N="50" REF="51">
I am, therefore, at Liberty to a&s;&s;ure you, that we remit all Thoughts of Vengeance again&s;t you: but it is nece&s;&s;ary that you &s;hould make a public Confe&s;&s;ion of your Crime, that the Innocence of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> may be fully cleared. That done, I will endeavour to &s;often the Rigour of your Sentence, and &s;ince you have voluntarily &s;urrendered your|&s;elf up to Ju&s;tice, Mercy, I hope, will find you.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Verague</HI> could no otherways reply to &s;uch a generous Speech than by a low Bow, and Eyes running over with Tears of Gra|titude and Joy. The Chevalier con&s;igned him to the Care of their Dome&s;tics, and they now &s;at down to Supper with great Satisfaction, nor forgot to ble&s;s and prai&s;e that Providence, which by &s;uch unexpected Means, had brought into their Power, the only Per&s;on who could clear the Innocence of the two illu&s;trious Accu&s;ed.</P>
<P>Early the next Morning, they took Leave of the Chevalier <HI>de Morigny,</HI> who was &s;oon to return to <HI>Malta,</HI> and &s;et out for <HI>Dover,</HI> taking <HI>Verague</HI> along with them. They em|barked immediately on board a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el, although the Sailors a&s;&s;ured them that they were threatened with a Storm, and notwith|&s;tanding all the frightful Pre&s;ages of Dan|ger and of Death &s;uch was their Impa|tience to get to <HI>France,</HI> that they in&s;i&s;ted

ab&s;olutely upon weighing Anchor: but we will now leave them to cro&s;s that Arm of the Sea which &s;eparates <HI>England</HI> from <HI>France,</HI> and return to <HI>Paris,</HI> where we left the lovely and unfortunate Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> a Prey to the mo&s;t cruel De&s;pair.</P>
<P>After a Stay of ten Days in <HI>Paris,</HI> &s;he concluded the Search for her would be pretty well over, and that &s;he might now pro&s;e|cute her Journey to <HI>Ga&s;cony</HI> with &s;afety. Accordingly &s;he mounted her Hor&s;e early in the Morning, and attended by her new Servant, went out of <HI>Paris.</HI> She had not rode above half a League from that City, when &s;he &s;aw at &s;ome Di&s;tance a Man on Hor&s;eback riding very fa&s;t towards it; as he approched nearer &s;he fancied &s;he had &s;een him before, and at length plainly knew him to be the Turnkey who had delivered her from the Little Chatelet. Her earne&s;t Gazing upon this Man having attracted his Attention, he &s;oon di&s;covered beneath that &s;trange Di&s;gui&s;e the Features of his lovely Pri&s;oner. Overjoyed that he had found her, and that he &s;hould be able to acquit him&s;elf of the Commi&s;&s;ion his Ma|&s;ter had given him, he rode up to her and &s;aid &s;oftly, for fear her &s;ervant &s;hould hear,
<Q>I have a Me&s;&s;age from the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars.</HI></Q></P>
<P>At the Sound of that Name the Blood for&s;ook the fair Cheeks of Madam <HI>de Berci,</HI>

an univer&s;al Trembling &s;eized her, &s;he dropt the Reins from her Hand, and would doubtle&s;s have fallen off her Hor&s;e, had not this faithful Servant of the Chevalier, per|ceiving her Emotion, ha&s;tily di&s;mounted and a&s;&s;i&s;ted her to do &s;o likewi&s;e. The Count|e&s;s a little recovered from her fir&s;t Surpri&s;e, ordered her Lacquey to take Care of the Hor&s;es, and then retiring with the Turnkey to the Shade of &s;ome Trees at a little Di&s;|tance from the great Road, &s;he a&s;ked him with a faltering Voice,
<Q>What he had to &s;ay to her?</Q></P>
<P><HI>Du Pons,</HI> for that was his Name, then informed her of his fortunate Meeting with the Chevalier, who had delivered him out of the Hands of the Archers; that ever &s;ince he had lived with him in the Quality of his Valet de Chambre, and that upon his Departure for <HI>England</HI> a few Days ago, he had ordered him to go to <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and deliver her a Letter; that not finding her in that Province, and hearing &s;he was in <HI>Paris,</HI> he had determined to &s;eek her in that City, and deliver his Ma&s;ter's Letter to her, tho' at the Hazard of his Life. Saying this, he took a Letter out of his Pocket and pre|&s;ented it to her, adding that his Ma&s;ter intended only to be pre&s;ent at the famous Tournament which was held in <HI>England,</HI> and would return again immediately to <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="54">The Counte&s;s opened the Letter with a trembling Impatience, &s;he found it filled with the tendere&s;t A&s;&s;urances of Love and Con&s;tancy, and a Promi&s;e of &s;oon throw|ing him&s;elf at her Feet, notwith&s;tanding all the Ob&s;tacles which oppo&s;ed it.
<Q>Ah! Traitor, cried &s;he when &s;he had read it through,</Q>
<Q>mu&s;t thou add Perjury to Ingra|titude, and Deceit to Incon&s;tancy?</Q>
The Tears which ran in great Abundance from her charming Eyes, as &s;he pronounced the&s;e Words, gave the Man &s;ome Su&s;picions of the true State of her Heart.
<Q>I am very &s;orry, Madam, &s;aid he to her, to have been the Me&s;&s;enger of News which &s;eem to give you &s;o much Pain.</Q>
<Q>Friend, replied the Counte&s;s, you may tell your Ma&s;ter that he might have &s;pared this In|&s;tance of Deceit, nor attempted to im|po&s;e upon one who too well knew his In|con&s;tancy: tell him I never more de&s;ire to hear him named. His di&s;&s;embled Love has been the Ruin of my Reputation, and the Cau&s;e of all the Misfortunes of my Life, which his Infidelity will &s;oon put a Period to.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ah! Madam, interrupted the faithful <HI>Du-Pons,</HI> do not, I conjure you load my Ma&s;ter with this unju&s;t Reproach, nor deprive your&s;elf of the Glory of being &s;erved by the mo&s;t faithful Lover that ever any Lady could boa&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="55">
<Q>You &s;urpri&s;e me greatly, Friend, an|&s;wered the Counte&s;s, by this Language; but I conjure you, if you have not en|tirely lo&s;t that Zeal you formerly expre&s;|&s;ed for my Service, or rather if your new Ma&s;ter has not corrupted your Mind, and rendered it as perfidious as his own, tell me the Truth, di&s;gui&s;e nothing from me. What could induce him to write to me in &s;uch pa&s;&s;ionate Terms, when his Heart is enflamed by a new Object; an arca|dian Huntre&s;s, added &s;he, &s;miling &s;corn|fully, a Puppet dre&s;t up with a Bow and Arrows, a mock <HI>Diana</HI> with a borrowed Form. De&s;picable Wretch! to fall from loving me to her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Good Heaven, Madam, interrupted the faithful Dome&s;tic of the Chevalier, how have, you &s;uffered your&s;elf to be deceiv|ed? What a cruel, what an unju&s;t Opi|nion have you entertained of the be&s;t and brave&s;t of Men? Pardon, I be&s;eech you, Madam, the Freedom of my Ex|pre&s;&s;ions, and impute it to my Zeal for your Intere&s;t, and my Regard for Truth, my Ma&s;ter never loved the Lady you mention. His Uncle introduced him un|awares into her Company, he beheld her with Indifference, and when in Obe|dience to the Commands of the old Mar|quis, who pa&s;&s;ionately wi&s;hed for an Al|liance between them, he made her &s;ome Vi&s;its, he behaved with a Coldne&s;s and
<PB N="55" REF="56">
Re&s;erve which mu&s;t have convinced her, his Heart was otherways engaged. He went to <HI>England</HI> with no other View but to avoid the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeing her, or break|ing entirely with his Uncle; and you may depend upon it, Madam, the Chevalier will never return into <HI>Ga&s;cony</HI> till he hears that young Lady is married, for her Beau|ty, in which &s;he yields to none of her Sex but to you, her immen&s;e Fortune, and the earne&s;t De&s;ires of his Uncle for this Match, were never able to &s;hake his unalterable Affection for you.</Q></P>
<P>The Counte&s;s felt her Heart ea&s;ed in&s;en|&s;ibly of part of its Grief by this hone&s;t and artle&s;s Defence of her Lover. But curious to know every Particular concerning this dreaded Rival, &s;he a&s;ked <HI>Du Pons</HI> a hundred Que&s;tions about her. His Replies gave her infinite Satisfaction, for &s;he found &s;he was not inferiour to her in any of the Graces and Virtues of her Sex. The martial Spi|rit of Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt,</HI> and her Ta&s;te for ma&s;culine Exerci&s;es, were Qua|lities indeed &s;he did not po&s;&s;e&s;s, and would have envied them in no other Woman but her Rival: but &s;he now fancied they gave peculiar Charms. She figured to her&s;elf a young and beautiful Girl dre&s;t in the plea&s;|ing Extravagance of an Amazon, vaulting upon her Steed like a winged Mercury, as the Poet expre&s;&s;es it, and brandi&s;hing a Spear in one lovely Hand, and by its
<PB N="56" REF="57">
graceful Motion &s;hewing the beautiful Sym|metry of her whole Form, her Eyes &s;park|ling with redoubled Rays, and her whole Countenance animated with that daring Spirit which di&s;tingui&s;hed her from other Women, and exalts her Beauty to &s;ome|thing more than mortal.</P>
<P>Thus did her jealous Fancy paint Made|moi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt:</HI> &s;he admired the beautiful Picture; &s;he wi&s;hed to copy its Graces, emulous of that Part of her Ri|val's Character in which &s;he only could excel her, &s;he a&s;pired to the Fame of a warlike Beauty, &s;he would like her, &s;tudy to be fiercely charming, in &s;hort &s;he would be an Amazon, and was re&s;olved to give her Lover &s;uch a Proof of her heroic Cou|rage and Genero&s;ity, as &s;hould render her &s;uperiour to her Rival in tho&s;e Qualities for which &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed he admired her.</P>
<P>This fanta&s;tic De&s;ign, thus &s;uddenly formed, &s;he told <HI>Du Pons,</HI> that the account he had given of his Ma&s;ter having in part removed her Su&s;picion, &s;he would de&s;i&s;t from the Enterpri&s;e &s;he had in hand when &s;he met him, and would return to <HI>Paris,</HI> but de&s;ired that he would wait her Com|mands in <HI>E&s;tampes,</HI> where he might re+main concealed, and that he &s;hould hear from her in a few Days. <HI>Du Pons,</HI> who had watched her Countenance, and &s;aw in it a much greater Appearance of Tranquility and
<PB N="57" REF="58">
Compo&s;ure than before, was charmed that he had rendered &s;uch an acceptable Piece of Service to his Ma&s;ter, as re&s;toring him to the good Opinion of the Woman he &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately loved, promi&s;ed not to &s;tir from <HI>E&s;tampes</HI> till he received her Orders. Ma|dam <HI>de Berci</HI> then took Leave of him, and mounting her Hor&s;e, returned back to <HI>Paris,</HI> and went to her former Lodg|ings, from whence &s;he di&s;patched her Servant to an Armourer to be&s;peak a compleat Suit of Armour, and to fini&s;h it with all Expedition.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> had formed no le&s;s a De&s;ign than to challenge the Count of <HI>Polan,</HI> in behalf of her Lover: if &s;he &s;hould happen by &s;ome extraordinary Chance to overcome, the Glory was apparent, and if &s;he fell, as it was but too probable, &s;he &s;hould at lea&s;t have the Satisfaction to die in Defence of the Man who had ungrate|fully abandoned her for a le&s;s worthy Wo|man. So extraordinary a Flight of Gene|ro&s;ity, would, as &s;he conceived, crown her with immortal Fame, and give her &s;uch an Advantage over her Rival, as would leave her nothing to hope for whether &s;he lived or died, as it mu&s;t fix her unalterably in the Chevalier's Affections.</P>
<P>The Reader will ea&s;ily conceive, that the Rea&s;on of this unhappy Lady mu&s;t be greatly di&s;turbed, otherways &s;he could not
<PB N="58" REF="59">
have formed &s;o ridiculous a Project. But there was female Pride, Envy, and Jealou&s;y at the Bottom, Pa&s;&s;ions very capable of in|&s;piring tho&s;e extravagant De&s;igns which this poor Lady pro&s;ecuted with &s;o much Ardour.</P>
<P>The Armour for our new Amazon was fini&s;hed, and brought home about ten Days before the Time pre&s;cribed by the King for the Combat between the Count of <HI>Po|lan</HI> and the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars.</HI> She put it on immediately, and being now armed from Head to Foot, &s;he fancied a Spirit unfelt before invigorated every Limb. Her Stature &s;eemed taller than u&s;ual, her Step was firmer, her Bo&s;om glowed with mar|tial Heat, and breathing Defiance and De|&s;truction to all her Enemies, &s;he &s;allied out of <HI>Paris</HI> with her faithful Attendant, and lodged that Night at <HI>Surene,</HI> from whence &s;he &s;ent her Servant the next Day with the following Letter to the Count of <HI>Polan.</HI></P>

<P>You have in the King's Pre&s;ence of|fered to fight an ab&s;ent Man who&s;e very Looks you dur&s;t not &s;u&s;tain; and you have undertaken to maintain by Force of Arms the Truth of an Accu&s;ation which you are not able to prove in a Court of Ju&s;tice. Since the Ab&s;ence of the Che|valier

</LETTER>
<P>The Counte&s;s having informed her Ser|vant where to find the Count of <HI>Polan,</HI> mounted immediately on Hor&s;e-back com|pleatly armed, and went to attend the Count's coming, on the fine Plain which lies between <HI>Surene</HI> and the Abbey of <HI>Lon|champ,</HI> commanding her Servant to meet her there as &s;oon as he had executed his Commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>This Dome&s;tic &s;et out in&s;tantly on his little Journey, and being no le&s;s prompt in his Obedience, than faithful to his Tru&s;t, although he knew not who his new Ma|&s;ter was, he made &s;uch Ha&s;te that he found the Count of <HI>Polan</HI> &s;till in Bed, when one of his Pages, urged by his Importu|nity,
<PB N="60" REF="61">
introduced him into his Lord's A|partment.</P>
<P>The Count was awake, ruminating on the Charms of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> when her Challenge was put into his Hand. Little did he imagine that it was from &s;o fair an Enemy, he received &s;uch a fierce Defiance: after reading the Billet atten|tively, he began to con&s;ider what he ought to do, in a Circum&s;tance &s;o perplexing: he felt an extreme Curio&s;ity to know who this Friend of the Chevalier was, who con|cealed his Name &s;o carefully, yet was not afraid to expo&s;e his Life to defend his Ho|nour and clear his Innocence. He a&s;ked the Counte&s;s's Servant &s;everal Que&s;tions, but could draw nothing from him. He knew not what Expedient to u&s;e to &s;atisfy this unknown Enemy: for brave and va|liant as he was, he was &s;en&s;ibly grieved to be obliged to refu&s;e his Challenge. But he was not willing to make a private Duel forbidden by the Laws, of a Combat au|thori&s;ed by the King. He therefore re&s;olv|ed to refu&s;e the Challenge, and an&s;wered the Letter he received, in the following Terms.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>The Count of <HI>POLAN</HI> to his unknown Enemy.</HEAD>
<P><Q>It is true that to revenge the Death of my Brother I have offered, in the Ab&s;ence of the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> to fight, any
<PB N="61" REF="62">
of his Friends, who &s;hould undertake his Defence: but it is not true that I derive any Courage from his Ab&s;ence, or that I fear to meet him. You &s;ay, if I had been able to prove his Crime in a Court of Ju&s;tice, I &s;hould not have had Recour&s;e to Arms; this may be true: but you ought not to infer from thence, that my Procedure is the Effect of Envy and Ma|lice. If you have as earne&s;t a De&s;ire to defend his Innocence, as I have to prove his Guilt, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to chu&s;e the Plain of <HI>Surens</HI> for our Combat, &s;ince the King has him&s;elf appointed a Place for the Deci&s;ion of this Affair by Arms. This is the only lawful Way of convincing his Maje&s;ty, and the whole Kingdom, of the Ju&s;tice of your Cau&s;e by the Succe&s;s of your Sword. You have only a few Days to wait, during which it will be prudent to moderate tho&s;e Sallies of your Rage, which rather merit my Contempt, than make you con&s;iderable. I &s;hall not &s;eek to know your Name, &s;ince you dare not di&s;cover it: but &s;hall &s;atisfy my&s;elf with knowing that you are my Enemy, and hope to prove by your Defeat, that you are but a weak Defender of the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI></Q></P>

</LETTER>
<P>The Count, after delivering this Billet in|to the Hands of Madam <HI>de Berci</HI>'s Servant, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him, and remained in great Per|plexity
<PB N="62" REF="63">
concerning the Name of this un|known Enemy, who with &s;uch Boldne&s;s defied him to a Combat, their Sovereign had expre&s;sly forbid. At fir&s;t he &s;u&s;pected it was the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> with whom he had already fought, and who he &s;uppo&s;ed was not &s;incerely reconciled to him. A Moment afterwards he imagined it was the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> him&s;elf, who was de&s;irous of changing into a private Duel a Combat which the King had decreed to be public. Many different Su&s;picions ro&s;e in his Mind: but not being able to come to any Certainty, he re&s;olved to wait patiently for farther Information, and to &s;ubmit to the King's Orders, by referring all to a public Deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mean Time our fair Challenger received the Count's An&s;wer with great Concern. She found, &s;he &s;hould be obliged to defer the Project her Head and Heart was full of, till the Time pre&s;cribed by the King for the Combat: and not knowing what to do with her&s;elf the eight Days that &s;till remained, &s;he re&s;olved to retire to <HI>E&s;tampes,</HI> where &s;he had a Kin&s;woman, Abbe&s;s of a Convent, to whom &s;he could fly for Refuge, if &s;he hap|pened to be di&s;covered, and who would af|ford her a &s;afe as well as honourable A&s;ylum.</P>
<P>While the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> thus acted Extravagancies unworthy of her Sex, her
<PB N="63" REF="64">
Mode&s;ty and Prudence, the old Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> her Father, finding the Day of Combat approach without hearing any News either of the Chevalier, or his Son, became extremely enraged again&s;t them both. However he would not abandon the Intere&s;ts of that Hero to whom he owed &s;o many Obligations, but determined, not|with&s;tanding his Age and Weakne&s;s, to &s;up|port them again&s;t the Count of <HI>Polan.</HI> Like|wi&s;e the old Marquis <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> having been informed by the young Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> of the State of his Nephew's Affairs at the Court of <HI>France,</HI> &s;et out from <HI>Ga&s;cony</HI> a few Days after that young Noble|man left him, in order to undertake his Nephew's Defence, for his Heart mi&s;gave him, that not knowing his Maje&s;ty's Re&s;o|tion, he had taken another Rout.</P>
<P>Accordingly on the Day of Battle, three Champions for the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> en|tered the Li&s;ts. The&s;e were the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> the Marquis <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> and the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci;</HI> two feeble old Men and a Woman: yet in the two for|mer the Want of Strength and Vigour was &s;upplied by Courage and Re&s;olution, and in the latter by all tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions which Rage produces in the Brea&s;t of a Woman who loves, and believes her&s;elf &s;lighted.</P>
<P>At the other End of the Li&s;ts entered the young Count of <HI>Polan,</HI> completely armed;
<PB N="64" REF="65">
and a few Moments afterwards came the King, the Queen, the Princes of the Blood, the Peers of <HI>France,</HI> and all the great Offi|cers of the Crown: four of whom were e&s;ta|bli&s;hed Judges of the Combat according to the ancient Laws and Cu&s;toms of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>When their Maje&s;ties were &s;eated upon their Scaffold, the three unknown Knights advanced and &s;aluted them without di&s;co|vering them&s;elves, but only declared that they were come to defend the Innocence of the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> not only again&s;t the Count of <HI>Polan,</HI> but again&s;t all tho&s;e who &s;hould dare to accu&s;e him of having killed the late Count of <HI>Polan</HI> otherways than as a Man of Honour &s;hould in a fair Duel. They then intreated his Maje&s;ty, that they three might be permitted to fight with the Count of <HI>Polan,</HI> and any two of his Friends whom he &s;hould chu&s;e: but the Count would have no Second, and offered to fight them one after another as long as he had any Strength left.</P>
<P>The King would grant neither of their Reque&s;ts. He commanded the three Un|known to draw Lots who &s;hould fight with the Count of <HI>Polan,</HI> and declared, that if he, upon whom the Lot &s;hould fall, &s;hould be vanqui&s;hed, neither of the others &s;hould be permitted to &s;upport the Intere&s;ts of the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> but that the Combat
<PB N="65" REF="66">
&s;hould end with the Defeat of the fir&s;t. Al|though this Decree was ab&s;olutely ju&s;t, yet the three Unknown were &s;en&s;ibly grieved at it: each dreaded he &s;hould be excluded from the Combat, but our fair Champion was in de&s;pair, &s;he &s;u&s;pected her bad For|tune would deny her the Glory of defending her Lover's Fame, and by that Means of enjoying his Affections undivided; but there was no Remedy, &s;he was obliged to &s;ubmit, and advanced with the two others who were required to tell their Names. Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> an&s;wered the fir&s;t, that he was called the <HI>Knight of the Eagle;</HI> the Marquis <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> that he was the <HI>Knight of the Lion,</HI> and Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> called her&s;elf the <HI>Knight without Hope,</HI> to expre&s;s her unhappy Situation.</P>
<P>The&s;e Names being writ, each upon a &s;mall Bit of Paper, they were put into an Urn, and a little Boy, who was there for that purpo&s;e, was ju&s;t preparing to draw them when a fourth Combatant appeared in the Li&s;ts, who &s;oon drew the Eyes of the whole A&s;&s;embly upon him. He was mount|ed on a Spani&s;h Genet, white as the driven Snow, his Arms of the &s;ame Colour, and richly adorned with Silver. The Devi&s;e upon his Shield was a Cupid who &s;lung him&s;elf among a great Quantity of Darts and Javelins, with this Motto: <HI>Notwith|&s;tanding I am defencele&s;s, yet I fear not their Points.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="67">After &s;aluting the King and Queen, with|out di&s;covering him&s;elf any more than the others had done, he told his Maje&s;ty, that, having more Intere&s;t in this Combat than any of tho&s;e who had pre&s;ented them&s;elves, he de&s;ired his Ju&s;tice would interpo&s;e, and give him the Preference, or at lea&s;t that he might be permitted to draw Lots with them.</P>
<P>The King granted the latter Part of his Reque&s;t, and the New Comer &s;tyling him|&s;elf the <HI>Knight of Mon&s;ieur des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> that Title was wrote upon a Bit of Paper which was put into the Ca&s;que with the others; they &s;hook them a long Time together, while each with mingled Hope, Fear and Impa|tience, waited to &s;ee in who&s;e Favour For|tune would declare her&s;elf. At length the Boy drew the la&s;t Comer's Billet out of the Ca&s;que: the three others were greatly griev|ed at their Di&s;appointment, and equally complained of his Arrival, and their own ill Luck.</P>
<P>The Judges now commanded the Field to be cleared. The Combatants withdrew to their &s;everal Places, the Trumpets gave the Signal, and after having taken their Ca|reer they &s;purred their Hor&s;es towards each other, and met with &s;uch Violence that their Lances, &s;triking again&s;t the Vi&s;ors of their Helmets, broke in a thou&s;and Pieces: they now drew their Swords and began a
<PB N="67" REF="68">
new Combat with equal Fury and with equal Succe&s;s. The Count of <HI>Polan</HI> was with Ju&s;tice thought one of the mo&s;t valiant Men in <HI>France,</HI> nor was his Enemy infe|riour to him either in Strength, Skill or A|gility. The Combat had now la&s;ted above an Hour without any vi&s;ible Advantage on either Side; the Judges obliged them to take Breath for &s;ome Moments, and while with a gloomy &s;ilence they darted fiery Glances at each other, the A&s;&s;embly, lo&s;t in Admiration of their Courage and Valour, &s;ent forth loud Shouts of Applau&s;e, and ex|pected the Event of &s;uch an extraordinary Combat with extreme Impatience.</P>
<P>Some made Vows for one, &s;ome for the other, as their different Pa&s;&s;ions were en|gaged: but the two old Marquis's and the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> although grieved that they were deprived of the Glory of &s;uch a Day, implored with Ardour the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Heaven in Favour of him, who with &s;o much Honour, &s;upported the Cau&s;e of the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars.</HI></P>
<P>The two Combatants were preparing to renew the Fight, when a Gentleman &s;ud|denly entered the Field; crying out that he had &s;omewhat of great Importance to declare to the King. The Croud made Way for him to the King's Scaffold, where as &s;oon as he arrived, he made a mo&s;t pro|found Obei&s;ance and de&s;ired his Maje&s;ty's

Permi&s;&s;ion to declare what he knew con|cerning the Death of the Count of <HI>Polan;</HI> to which the King con&s;enting he &s;poke in this Manner.</P>
<P><Q>It was but a few Hours ago, Sire, that I heard your Maje&s;ty had permitted a Combat between the young Count of <HI>Polan</HI> and the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> or any Friend of his who in his Ab&s;ence &s;hould undertake his Defence. I was Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e to the decea&s;ed Count, and was pre&s;ent at his Death. No one but my&s;elf can inform your Maje&s;ty of the Manner of it, &s;ince I was unhappy enough to &s;ee my dear Ma&s;ter fall, and to clo&s;e his Eyes. The Chevalier and he fought with equal Succe&s;s for &s;ome Time; at length my Ma&s;ter received a mortal Wound: the Chevalier retired in&s;tantly with his Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, who be&s;ides my&s;elf was the only Witne&s;s of the Com|bat. I flew in&s;tantly to my dear Ma&s;ter, I &s;upported him in my Arms; the&s;e were the la&s;t Words he &s;poke to me:</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is but ju&s;t that I &s;hould fall by the Hand of the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> I have injured him: the Vengeance he has taken is brave and lawful, Heaven has given the Victory to him that de|&s;erved it; I forgive him my Death, which I have ju&s;tly merited; and from the Good|ne&s;s of God and through my &s;incere Re|pentance
<PB N="69" REF="70">
for the Crime I have committed, I hope for Pardon and Salvation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He &s;aid no more, and, &s;tifled with his Blood, he lo&s;t at one In&s;tant both Speech and Life. I was not able to continue in <HI>Paris</HI> after the Lo&s;s of &s;o good a Ma&s;ter. I travelled through <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> amu&s;ing my Melancholy with a Variety of different Objects. When Time had a little &s;oftened my Grief, I returned to my own Country, on my Arrival at <HI>Paris</HI> the fir&s;t News I heard was of the Combat your Maje&s;ty had permitted, whereupon I came immediately hither, to declare to your Maje&s;ty my Ma&s;ter's la&s;t Words, to the end that you may make &s;uch U&s;e of them as your Wi&s;dom and Equity &s;hall &s;ugge&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>When this Gentleman had done &s;peak|ing, a confu&s;ed Murmur aro&s;e in the A&s;|&s;embly, which broke out at length into Shouts and Exclamations, &s;uch was the al|mo&s;t univer&s;al Joy at this Confirmation of the Chevalier's Innocence: when the Noi&s;e was a little abated, the King commanded the two Combatants to draw near his Scaf|fold, and then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Un+known, he a&s;ked him what Proof he had of the Innocence of the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> which he defended with &s;uch Confidence and Bravery.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="71">
<Q>I have no other, Sire, replied the Un|known, than the Glory he has acquired by tho&s;e many brave Actions he has performed, and which makes it highly improbable he could be guilty of a ba&s;e A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And you, Count, &s;aid the King, what A&s;&s;urance have you, that the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated your Brother?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Sire, replied the Count, I know that the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> killed my Bro|ther: I know that he called him to the Field, and no Seconds being employed, it is highly probable, con&s;idering the re|markable Bravery and Skill of my Bro|ther, that the Chevalier took him at &s;ome unfair Advantage: but be that as it will, my Brother died by his Hands, and I hold my &s;elf obliged in Honour to re|venge his Death.</Q></P>
<P><Q>There is more Pa&s;&s;ion and Prejudice than Honour in your Procedure, replied the King, frowning, and know to your Confu&s;ion and Remor&s;e, that I have &s;uf|ficient Proofs of your Brother's being the Aggre&s;&s;or in this Quarrel, and (in a low Voice he added) that he ju&s;tly merited his End. This Man whom you &s;ee here, and probably know to have be|longed to your Brother, was pre&s;ent at his Death, and will inform you of &s;uch
<PB N="71" REF="72">
Circum&s;tances, as will put his Fault out of Doubt. I therefore, pur&s;ued his Ma|je&s;ty rai&s;ing his voice, declare the Cheva|lier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> innocent of the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tion of the late Count of <HI>Polan</HI> your Brother: it is my Will that you never more mention this Affair to his Di&s;ho|nour, and I command you to embrace not only this Enemy who&s;e Force you have &s;o lately proved, but al&s;o the three others who offered to fight with you in Defence of the Chevalier's Innocence.</Q></P>
<P>The Count was too politic a Courtier to di&s;obey this Command: without an&s;wering the King any otherways than by a low Bow, he remitted his Sword to the Scab|bard, and taking off his Helmet, advanced with open Arms towards that Enemy who&s;e Blood he had before &s;o anxiou&s;ly &s;ought.</P>
<P>The Unknown not willing to be outdone in Politene&s;s, came forwards with equal Ea|gerne&s;s to receive him, and holding out one Hand to the Count's offered friendly Gra&s;p, with the other pulled off his Helmet, and by the fair long Hair which fell in graceful Curls all over her Shoulders, di&s;covered that that Courage and Valour, which had at|tracted &s;o much Admiration, were exerted by a young and mo&s;t beautiful Woman.</P>
<P>A thou&s;ands Shouts and Acclamations &s;ucceeded to the general Surpri&s;e. The
<PB N="72" REF="73">
Count, who at the fir&s;t Sight of his fair Ene|my, had &s;tarted back in A&s;toni&s;hment, re|mained for &s;ome Moments immoveable, with his Eyes fixed on her Face. His fir&s;t Emo|tions were all Shame and Regret, at his having found in a Woman, an Enemy &s;o redoubtable: but when he had well exami|ned that lovely Face, he found her Charms more dangerous even than her Sword, and lo&s;ing all Remembrance of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> whom he de&s;paired of ever obtaining, he left his Liberty at the Feet of the fair Warrior, and ki&s;&s;ing her Hand, vowed to acknowledge her ever for his Conqueror.</P>
<P>The old Marquis <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> acknowledg|ing Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt</HI> in the Per|&s;on of the fair Defender of his Nephew's Honour, came eagerly up to &s;alute her, and taking her Hand led her to his Ma|je&s;ty. <HI>Henry,</HI> ever gallant and polite to Ladies, expre&s;&s;ed his Admiration of the ex|traordinary Beauty and wonderful Quali|ties of Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt,</HI> in Terms capable of &s;atisfying the mo&s;t vain and ambitious of the Sex: the charming Amazon by a mode&s;t Blu&s;h, and Eyes ca&s;t down in &s;weet Confu&s;ion, made it evident &s;he had not in her ma&s;culine Acquirements, lo&s;t any of the female Graces. She kneel|ed graceful upon one Knee to the King, and made a Motion to ki&s;s his Hand: but that Prince in&s;tantly rai&s;ing her, gallantly pre&s;t her Lips with his, telling her that
<PB N="73" REF="74">
&s;uch Charms exacted a &s;weet Homage from the whole World. He then pre&s;ented her him&s;elf to the Queen.</P>
<P><Q>Behold, Madam, &s;aid he to that Prin|ce&s;s, a new Amazon, who&s;e Beauty yields not to the Faire&s;t, nor who&s;e Valour to the Brave&s;t in my Kingdom: you have often heard of Cavalier's fighting in Honour of Ladies, but you have now &s;een a fair Lady expo&s;ing her Life to defend the Honour, and a&s;&s;ert the Innocence of an illu&s;trious Cavalier.</Q>
The Queen expre&s;&s;ed great Admiration of the charming Warrior, and would not &s;uffer her to ki&s;s her Iland, but &s;aluted her with much Civility.</P>
<P>While the thoughts of the whole A&s;&s;em|bly were employed on &s;o new and &s;urpri&s;ing a Spectacle, the unfortunate Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> under her martial Di&s;gui&s;e remain|ed in a Situation truly pitiable. She &s;aw that Glory, &s;he was &s;o ambitious of gain|ing and upon which &s;he had founded all her Hopes of fixing the Chevalier hers, &s;natched from her by a Rival, and a Rival &s;o worthy to be loved, that &s;he could not doubt of her Power over any Heart &s;he wi&s;hed to gain; &s;he reflected with the mo&s;t poignant Grief upon the violent Affection Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt</HI> bore to the Chevalier, which had led her from the Ex|tremities of the Kingdom to expo&s;e her Life in &s;o dangerous a Combat, an Affection &s;o
<PB N="74" REF="75">
like her own, equal in its Force, and made more certain by its Con&s;equences. She was now concerned that the Chevalier would not be able to defend him&s;elf again&s;t the powerful Charms and &s;trong Affection of that wonderful Girl, and that he would love her with an Ardour equal to the Pa&s;|&s;ion &s;he felt for him. With inconceivable Affliction &s;he ob&s;erved the extraordinary Re&s;pect and Tenderne&s;s &s;hewn her by the old Marquis <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> and thence drew a Proof of her Lover's Infidelity, and declared Intention to marry her. A thou&s;and times more wretched than before, &s;he withdrew unnoticed from the A&s;&s;embly, and took the Road immediately to <HI>E&s;tampes.</HI></P>
<P>The King having given a very gracious Reception to the Marqui&s;es <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> and <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> who both made them|&s;elves known to him, enquired for the third Champion who had pre&s;ented him&s;elf to fight with the Count of <HI>Polan.</HI> The two Marqui&s;es declared they knew him not, nor what was become of him. The King cu|rious to know who he was, ordered an Ex|empt of his Guards to &s;eek for him, and inform him&s;elf of his Name and Quality. His Maje&s;ty then went into his Coach with the Queen, and returned to the Louvre fol|lowed by the whole Court.</P>
<P>It would be difficult to give the Reader an Idea of the Joy felt by the two good
<PB N="75" REF="76">
old Champions at hearing the Innocence of the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> publicly declared by the Mouth of the be&s;t and greate&s;t King in the World: the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sau|veur</HI> had now nothing more to wi&s;h for, than that his Daughter's Fame might be as fully cleared, which the &s;trong Prejudice again&s;t the Chevalier, being &s;o happily re|moved, made Way for. As for the old Marquis, charmed into Rapture by the noble Action of Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevin|court;</HI> he was full of Hopes that his Ne|phew's Gratitude being &s;o much engaged, he would be no longer able to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> his Hand to a Woman, who on &s;o many Ac|counts, merited his utmo&s;t Affection.</P>
<P>But it is now Time to return to the Chevalier, whom we left with his Compa|nions cro&s;&s;ing that Arm of the Sea which &s;eparates <HI>England</HI> from <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Their Ve&s;&s;el had yet made but little Way, when the Storm increa&s;ing, they &s;uffered during this &s;hort Voyage a thou&s;and terrible Dangers. The Sky became ob&s;cured with thick black Clouds, which covered them with a fearful Darkne&s;s, interrupted only by In|tervals with the horrid Glare of Light|nings, &s;ucceeded by Thunder-claps &s;o loud, and long, as if the World was bur&s;ting. The furious Winds blew with &s;uch Violence and put the Waves into &s;uch Agitation, that &s;ometimes their little Ve&s;&s;el was lifted
<PB N="76" REF="77">
aloft to the Clouds, and &s;ometimes the Bil|lows breaking beneath it, they &s;eemed &s;wal|lowed in the va&s;t Aby&s;s.</P>
<P>The Pilot di&s;mayed, endeavoured for &s;ome Moments to re&s;i&s;t the Storm, and vainly guided the u&s;ele&s;s Rudder; but was at length obliged to quit it. The Sailors in wild Con&s;ternation, no longer obeyed his Direc|tions; and the Terror and Confu&s;ion in the Ve&s;&s;el was &s;o great, that nothing was heard but di&s;mal Cries, confounded with the roar|ing of the Winds, the da&s;hing of the Waves and loud Peals of Thunder, that filled every Brea&s;t with Horror un&s;peakable.</P>
<P>The Pilot being per&s;uaded that the Ve&s;|&s;el would be wrecked, and willing to take care of him&s;elf, jumped into the Boat with an Intention to e&s;cape; but the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> who was attentive to all that pa&s;|&s;ed, perceiving his Intention, leaped in|&s;tantly after him, and holding his drawn Sword to his Brea&s;t, threatened to take away his Life immediately if he did not re&s;ume the Government of the Helm. The terrified Pilot &s;eeing Death on all Sides, cho&s;e rather to hazard being &s;hipwrecked, than meet the Rage of the furious Chevalier: but as he was preparing to climb up the Side of the Ve&s;&s;el, a Wave da&s;hed again&s;t the Boat with &s;uch Violence as broke the Rope with which it was fa&s;tened to the Ship, and in a Moment it was driven from
<PB N="77" REF="78">
it to &s;uch a Di&s;tance, that all their Endea|vours to join it again, were fruitle&s;s.</P>
<P>The Chevalier in an Exce&s;s of Rage to be parted thus from his Friends, would have &s;acrificed the Wretch who was the Cau&s;e of this Accident, to his ju&s;t Revenge, if he had not had Occa&s;ion for his Skill to &s;ave the Boat from peri&s;hing. Mean time his Friends lo&s;ing Sight of the Boat did not doubt but it was &s;wallowed up by the Waves, and abandoned them&s;elves to Complaints and De&s;pair for the Lo&s;s of the Chevalier. Their Ve&s;&s;el for twenty four Hours continued to be to&s;t by the Tempe&s;t; at length the Winds cea&s;ed, the Sky became &s;erene, and they were landed &s;afely at the Port of <HI>Ca|lais.</HI> Their happy Deliverance in&s;pired them with &s;ome Hopes that the Chevalier al&s;o might have e&s;caped; but the Uncertainty of his Fate filled them with the mo&s;t poignant Grief. Although they would willingly have &s;taid at <HI>Calais,</HI> till they had received &s;ome certain Accounts of him, yet his Honour and Intere&s;t required that they &s;hould ha&s;ten immediately to <HI>Paris,</HI> that they might be time enough for the Combat with the Count of <HI>Polan,</HI> for they both were determined to defend his Innocence to the la&s;t drop of their Blood: accordingly they lay but one Night at <HI>Calais</HI> and &s;et out early the next Morn|ing for <HI>Paris;</HI> neverthele&s;s they could not get there with <HI>Verague,</HI> till the Day after
<PB N="78" REF="79">
the Combat, which was a &s;en&s;ible Morti|fication to them both.</P>
<P>The melancholy News they brought con|cerning the Chevalier, filled the old Mar|quis <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> with inconceivable affliction. The whole Family of <HI>Saint-Sauveur</HI> mourn|ed his Lo&s;s with as many Tears as if he had been one of their neare&s;t Relations. No one doubted that he had peri&s;hed in the Boat: but altho' he had indeed been expo&s;ed to &s;till greater Danger than his Friends, yet Provi|dence delivered him likewi&s;e, the Boat was ca&s;t on the I&s;land of <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> from whence, after a &s;hort Stay to refre&s;h them&s;elves, the Chevalier and the Pilot embarked on board a Ve&s;&s;el bound for <HI>Normandy,</HI> and arriving happily at <HI>Rouen,</HI> the Chevalier &s;topped there a few Days, in order to purcha&s;e Hor&s;es, Arms and Cloaths, for he was de&s;titute of all.</P>
<P>In the mean Time <HI>Du Pons,</HI> his faithful Valet meeting at <HI>Paris</HI> the Bi&s;cayan who be|longed to the Chevalier, and who had come thither with the young Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> and the Count of <HI>Berci,</HI> he learned from him the &s;ad News of his Ma&s;ter's Shipwreck. The poor Fellow in the utmo&s;t Agony of Grief, re&s;olved to go in Search of the Chevalier; not being able to bear the cruel Uncertainty he was in; but apprehen&s;ive of the De&s;pair to which he knew the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> was reduced, for he had carefully watched all her Mo|tions,
<PB N="79" REF="80">
he would not leave <HI>Paris</HI> till he had acquainted her Relations with the Place of her Retreat, and provided for her Safety: he therefore went immediately to the old Mar|quis <HI>de Saint Sauveur,</HI> and informed him that the Per&s;on who called him&s;elf the <HI>Knight without Hope,</HI> and who had pre|&s;ented him&s;elf on the Day of Combat to fight the Count of <HI>Polan,</HI> was no other than his own Daughter, who upon the Sight of the fair Amazon had left the A&s;&s;embly in De&s;pair and retired to <HI>E&s;tampes,</HI> where &s;he had remained concealed for eight Days before, waiting for that of the Combat; he added that he had indeed engaged his word to her not to di&s;cover her to any one, neverthele&s;s the terrible Situation to which &s;he was reduced from her Jealou&s;y and Grief, had made him di&s;pen&s;e with his Promi&s;e, which he could not keep but to her Prejudice.</P>
<P>The Marquis, after rewarding this faithful Dome&s;tic for his care, communicated what he had heard immediately to his Wife and Son. The old Marchione&s;s was overjoyed to hear News of her Daughter, and the Hope of folding her again in her Arms, bani&s;hed all Reflection upon the Extrava|gance of her Conduct. But it was not the &s;ame with the young Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sau|veur,</HI> he was inexpre&s;&s;ibly grieved at the Di&s;honour he conceived his Si&s;ter had brought upon her&s;elf and her Family, by
<PB N="80" REF="81">
Expedition which nothing but Madne&s;s could excu&s;e.</P>
<P>The old Marquis ordered him to &s;et out in&s;tantly for <HI>E&s;tampes,</HI> but &s;eeing Fury in his Eyes, he recommended it to him to treat his Si&s;ter with the utmo&s;t Gentlene&s;s, &s;ince it was to be feared that if any Re&s;ent|ment was &s;hewn to her, it might produce &s;till wor&s;e Con&s;equences. The young Mar|quis promi&s;ed to obey his Father's In&s;truc|tions and took Hor&s;e immediately for <HI>E|&s;tampes:</HI> when he came to the Hou&s;e where our fair Adventurer lodged, it was quite Night, the Counte&s;s was retired to her Chamber, the Door of which &s;he had &s;o well fa&s;tened within, that the young Mar|quis, who had in vain endeavoured to open it without Noi&s;e, was forced to knock loudly for Admittance.</P>
<P>Madam <HI>de Berci,</HI> before &s;he would open the Door, put on her Armour, in order to be better concealed. Her Brother upon his Entrance &s;eeing her in &s;uch a ridiculous Equipage, could not help laughing, though his Heart was torn with Grief and Shame. Rage now taking full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him, he loaded her with the mo&s;t cruel Re|proaches, as &s;he &s;tood trembling before him; he enlarged upon the Affliction her Parents had &s;uffered, upon her Account; and giving her romantick Expedition a
<PB N="81" REF="82">
thou&s;and cruel Epithets, he told her, her Re|putation was ruined for ever.</P>
<P>The poor frighted Counte&s;s now plainly knew that &s;he had been betrayed by the Che|valier's Valet de Chambre, and that her whole Secret was known; in&s;tead therefore of offering at any Excu&s;e, or re&s;enting her Brother's injurious Expre&s;&s;ions, &s;he took off her Ca&s;que, and without an&s;wering a &s;ingle Word, let fall a Shower of Tears.</P>
<P>The young Marqui&s;s was greatly affect|ed with this &s;oft, and humble Deportment of his Si&s;ter, he cur&s;t his own Violence of Tem|per, and catching her as &s;he was ready to &s;ink in his Arms, he embraced her tender|ly, a&s;ked her Pardon for the cruel Invec|tives he had uttered, and endeavoured to con&s;ole her, by all the Arguments that Ten|derne&s;s and Compa&s;&s;ion could &s;ugge&s;t. As he had been informed of what &s;he had &s;uf|fered from that mo&s;t violent and impetuous of all Pa&s;&s;ions, Jealou&s;y, he omitted no|thing which he thought could undeceive her with regard to the Su&s;picions &s;he had entertained of the Infidelity of her Lover. He gave her a long and particular Account of all that had happened to the Chevalier in <HI>Ga&s;cony</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> and endeavoured to convince her by a thou&s;and Circum|&s;tances that he had always loved her with the utmo&s;t Ardour. He le&s;&s;ened indeed the Danger in which he had left him, when
<PB N="82" REF="83">
the Boat was unfortunately &s;eparated from their Ve&s;&s;el, but he could not di&s;gui&s;e from her the Apprehen&s;ions he was under with regard to his Safety.</P>
<P>At this melancholy Recital, the Counte&s;s felt all her Tenderne&s;s for this unfortunate Lover renewed. Her Jealou&s;y vani&s;hed in a Moment, or gave place to Emotions of a very different Nature: his Danger only employed her Thoughts, and filled her with a thou&s;and dreadful Apprehen&s;ions. She was not capable of ta&s;ting any Joy for the fortunate Meeting with <HI>Verague,</HI> important as it was for the Ju&s;tification of her Inno|cence: the Idea of her beloved Chevalier peri&s;hing in the Waves, engro&s;&s;ed her whole Soul and made her in&s;en&s;ible to every Thing el&s;e. In this cruel Situation of Mind, &s;he told her Brother, that after the &s;trange Step &s;he had taken, which would cover her with everla&s;ting Confu&s;ion, &s;he had not the Con|fidence to meet the Looks of her offended Parents, and that before he had di&s;covered her, it was her Intention to have retired to <HI>E&s;tampes</HI> in the Convent of which their Kin&s;woman was Abbe&s;s, and &s;he now beg|ged that he would permit her to pro&s;ecute her De&s;ign, &s;ince if it was certainly true that the Chevalier was &s;hipwrecked, &s;he was determined to pa&s;s the re&s;t of her Days there.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="84">The Marqui&s;s would not then contend with her, about her withdrawing entirely from the World, if the Chevalier &s;hould be really lo&s;t, but approved her De&s;ign for the pre&s;ent; judging it would be more honourable for her to be found in a Con|vent, than concealed in a private Lodging at <HI>E&s;tampes.</HI> He then de&s;ired her to leave her Hor&s;e, her Armour and her Servant where they now were, and he conducted her &s;ecretly to the Convent; where the Coun|te&s;s was received by the Abbe&s;s who knew her Story, with all imaginable Ten|derne&s;s.</P>
<P>The pious Lady who had been informed of her Flight from the Chatelet, was not &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee her in the Habit of a Man, and charmed to have it in her Power to oblige a Lady of her high Rank, and who was allied to her by Blood, &s;he omitted nothing which &s;he thought could con&s;ole her, and render the Retreat &s;he had cho&s;en agree|able to her.</P>
<P>The Marquis, plea&s;ed that his Si&s;ter was &s;o happily &s;ettled, took Leave of her and the Abbe&s;s, and returned in ha&s;te to <HI>Paris,</HI> and re&s;tored Peace to the Hearts of his af|flicted Parents, by the Account he gave them of their Daughter's pre&s;ent Situation.</P>
<P>Mean time the Exempt, who in Obe|dience to the King's Orders, had &s;earched
<PB N="84" REF="85">
all the Villages in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Paris</HI> for the unknown Knight, who had &s;o &s;uddenly di&s;appeared from the A&s;&s;embly, learned at length that he had been &s;een to take the Road to <HI>E&s;tampes.</HI> He went thi|ther immediately, and made &s;uch diligent Enquiry after him, that he di&s;covered where he had lodged, and found there his Hor&s;e and Arms which he carried back with him to <HI>Paris,</HI> but could give the King no other Satisfaction with regard to the Knight him&s;elf, than that he had been &s;een the Day before he came there, to go out with a Gentleman and had never return|ed &s;ince.</P>
<P>The King, as &s;oon as he &s;aw the Arms; knew them to be the &s;ame which the un|known Knight had worn, and being very de&s;irous to di&s;cover the Owner, he ordered them to be hung up in a publick Place till they were claimed. The&s;e Orders were ju&s;t given, when the fair Amazon arrived at the <HI>Louvre,</HI> to pay her Duty to his Ma|je&s;ty: &s;he had re&s;umed the Habit of her Sex, in which &s;he appeared &s;o beautiful, that &s;he &s;oon captivated the Hearts of &s;eve|ral of the young Lords of the Court, who thought it an Honour to wear her Chains, but &s;he beheld the&s;e Conque&s;ts with an ab|&s;olute Indifference. The Ab&s;ence of him, for whom &s;he had undertaken &s;o long a Journey, and &s;o dangerous an Enterpri&s;e,
<PB N="85" REF="86">
damped the Joy &s;he would otherways have felt, at the Power of her Beauty.</P>
<P>The King having cau&s;ed the Arms that had been ju&s;t brought him, to be &s;hewn to her, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ing that they belonged to the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> him&s;elf, and that he was the Unknown who had di&s;appeared &s;o &s;uddenly from the A&s;&s;embly, intreated the King that tho&s;e Arms might be hung up in the Place of Battle, and that &s;he might be permitted to defend them, again&s;t any Per&s;on, who &s;hould offer to demand them, without making him&s;elf known. The King could not help &s;miling at this Reque&s;t of the fair Virago, but before he could an&s;wer her, &s;he conjured him in the mo&s;t earne&s;t Manner imaginable, to permit her in the &s;ame Place, to &s;upport the Innocence of the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> and the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;hould accu&s;e them of having a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated the late Count of <HI>Berci.</HI></P>
<P>The Marqui&s;es <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> and <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> and the young Count of <HI>Berci,</HI> were pre&s;ent at this Di&s;cour&s;e of the charming Amazon, they knew the Arms of the Coun|te&s;s, and had ju&s;t before been informed of the Place to which &s;he had retired. But although they had it now in their Power to prove the Innocence of the Chevalier and Counte&s;s, by the Witne&s;s and Confe&s;&s;ion of the real A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in; yet they had agreed among
<PB REF="87">
them&s;elves, not to produce <HI>Verague</HI> till they knew certainly the De&s;tiny of the Chevalier, and therefore took no Notice of Mademoi|&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt's</HI> Propo&s;al.</P>
<P>The King then turning to the young Count of <HI>Berci,</HI> as being the Per&s;on who had mo&s;t Intere&s;t in revenging the Death of the late Count his Brother, a&s;ked him if he had any Reply to make to the fair Amazon's Reque&s;t.</P>
<P>The Count an&s;wered, that having al|ways had a great E&s;teem, and Veneration for his Si&s;ter-in-law, on account of her many Virtues, he never entertained the lea&s;t Su|&s;picion, of her being capable of &s;o black a Crime, and that there was not any Room to believe the Chevalier was guilty of it either.</P>
<P>That great Monarch, then taking Made|moi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt's</HI> Hand, told her &s;miling, that he would permit her to de|fend the Arms of the Unknown, on the Con|ditions &s;he had required, but he refu&s;ed her the Combat &s;he demanded, &s;ince he who was particularly intere&s;ted in revenging the Count, acknowledged the Counte&s;s his Wi|dow and the Chevalier to be innocent: his Maje&s;ty then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Mar|qui&s;es <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> and <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> told them, that the two Per&s;ons who were ac|cu&s;ed, might come to <HI>Paris</HI> without any Fear
<PB N="87" REF="88">
of a Pro&s;ecution, that he would re&s;erve the Examination of this Affair to him&s;elf, and that he would give them the Court, for their Pri&s;on.</P>
<P>The two Marqui&s;es threw them&s;elves at the King's Feet, and expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t Acknowledgment, for this new Mark of his Goodne&s;s. They al&s;o returned Made|moi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt</HI> Thanks, for her ge|nerou&s;ly offered Defence of the two noble Accu&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Arms were accordingly carried to the Field of Battle, and laid in a Tent erected there for that Purpo&s;e till &s;ome one &s;hould pre&s;ent him&s;elf to demand them. Mean time the Marqui&s;s <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> with the Ladies, accompanied by the Marqui&s;s <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> and the Count of <HI>Berci,</HI> went to <HI>E&s;tampes</HI> to vi&s;it the Counte&s;s, and to bring her back to <HI>Paris,</HI> where &s;he might now appear, without any Apprehen&s;ions on account of her E&s;cape from the Chatelet. She had quitted her Di&s;gui&s;e, and a&s;&s;umed the Habit of her Sex.</P>
<P>When &s;he was informed of their Arrival, &s;he appeared before them in &s;uch a &s;weet Confu&s;ion as gave new Lu&s;tre to her Charms. The Marquis <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> as &s;oon he beheld her, not only pardoned his Nephew, for his Di&s;obedience, but &s;ecretly acknowledged he
<PB N="88" REF="89">
was in the Right, not to quit &s;o lovely a Creature for any Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>'I am not &s;urpri&s;ed, Madam,' &s;aid the good old Man, &s;aluting her with great Re&s;pect,
<Q>that tho&s;e who have had the Honour to attach them&s;elves to your Ser|vice, &s;hould prefer that &s;weet Slavery to all other Advantages; even I, tho' bending under the Weight of Years, feel the Influence of your Beauty, and all my Rea&s;on is &s;carce &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve me from your Charms.</Q></P>
<P>The Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> could not hear Prai&s;es &s;o flattering to her Self-love, from the Uncle of the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> without feeling a con&s;cious Plea&s;ure which &s;parkled in her Eyes, tho' her natural Mode&s;ty at &s;uch ex|traordinary Encomiums, died her fair Checks with Blu&s;hes, and kept her for a Moment &s;ilent; but recovering her&s;elf, &s;he an&s;wered his Compliment with &s;o much Wit, and &s;uch a graceful Politene&s;s, that the old Man was wholly charmed with her.</P>
<P>Her Father and Mother advancing to em|brace her, &s;he turned from the Marquis and threw her&s;elf at their Feet, intreating them with Tears, which falling from the fine&s;t Eyes in the World, could not fail of gaining all &s;he a&s;ked, to pardon her for the Unea&s;i|ne&s;s &s;he had given them.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="90">The tender Parents rai&s;ing her eagerly, de&s;ired her not to interrupt their Joy at this happy Meeting, by recalling to their Re|membrance any pa&s;t Misfortune.
<Q>And now, my Daughter, (&s;aid the indulgent Father, who knew not that &s;he was in|formed of the Return of <HI>Verague</HI>) thank the Marquis <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> and the Count of <HI>Berci</HI> your Brother-in-law, together with a beautiful and valiant Lady, that without any Apprehen&s;ions of the Chatelet, or any other Pri&s;on but the Court, the Chevalier and you, may enjoy the Sweets of Liberty, and be obliged to appear at no other Tri|bunal but that of the King him&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>The Counte&s;s, plea&s;ed as &s;he was, at this News, felt an Emotion at the Mention of the fair Warrior, which for a Moment changed the bright Vermillion of her Cheeks into a languid Palene&s;s; a Sigh &s;tole from her Brea&s;t, which was not perceived by all the Company: her Brother and the young Mar|chione&s;s, her Si&s;ter-in-law, who be&s;t knew the jealous Doubts which filled her Mind, were the only Per&s;ons who ob&s;erved it, and in order to relieve her from her Embarra&s;s|ment, they pre&s;&s;ed forward to embrace her; &s;he received their tender Care&s;&s;es with a grateful Sen&s;ibility: but embracing her beloved Si&s;ter, dropt a tender Tear upon her Bo&s;om, which her full Eyes could not re&s;train.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="91">After a few Hours-Stay in the Convent, during which the Abbe&s;s received the Thanks of the joyful Parents, for the Friend|&s;hip &s;he had &s;hewn to their Daughter, they &s;et out for <HI>Paris,</HI> and got there Time enough to go to the <HI>Louvre.</HI> The King being then in the Queen's Apartment, they were intro|duced immediately to their Maje&s;ties.</P>
<P>'Sire, (&s;aid the Marquis <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> pre|&s;enting the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> to the King)
<Q>behold the Lady whom the De&s;ire of ju&s;ti|fying the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> for the Murder of the Count of <HI>Polan,</HI> induced to di&s;gui&s;e her&s;elf under the Arms which your Maje&s;ty has committed to the Care of a fair and illu&s;trious Warrior. We do not pre&s;ent our&s;elves before your Maje&s;ty, to intreat they may be re&s;tored to her, her Beauty is more powerful than all the Weapons in the World: but we are come to expre&s;s our Acknowledgement, with her, for your Maje&s;ty's having been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to take her Cau&s;e under your own Cognizance, from which &s;he has nothing but the exacte&s;t Ju&s;tice to expect.</Q></P>
<P>The Counte&s;s then throwing her&s;elf at the King's Feet, that good Prince, who had never &s;een her before, for the retired Life &s;he had led for &s;ome Years pa&s;t, had not admitted of her coming to Court, was &s;o &s;truck with her Beauty, which appeared to great Advantage, by her &s;uppliant Po&s;ture,
<PB N="91" REF="92">
and the graceful Awe, which &s;at upon her lovely Features, that forgetting &s;he was kneeling, through the Plea&s;ure he took in looking at her, he &s;uffered her to remain a few Moments at his Feet, when &s;uddenly recollecting him&s;elf, he rai&s;ed her with Pre|cipitation, and politely &s;aluting her, led her to the Queen.</P>
<P><Q>Our Age, Madam, &s;aid he, pre&s;enting her to that Prince&s;s, is fruitful in Pro|digies. What think you of this new Amazon? <HI>Ventre Saint Gris!</HI> (his u&s;ual Oath) it would have been pity to &s;uffer &s;uch a Jewel to be locked up in the Chatelet.</Q></P>
<P>The Queen &s;aluted her, and &s;miling, told his Maje&s;ty, that tho&s;e who had taken her from the Place he mentioned, had given a Proof of their Judgment and Sen&s;ibility.</P>
<P>The Queen had ju&s;t done &s;peaking, when Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt,</HI> who had been informed of the Arrival of the Counte&s;s, as al&s;o that it was her who owned the black Armour which &s;he had undertaken to de|fend, entered her Maje&s;ty's Apartment, led by the Count of <HI>Polan.</HI></P>
<P><Q>Fair Amazon (&s;aid the King as &s;oon as he &s;aw her) you mu&s;t &s;urrender the Arms you guard, unle&s;s you re&s;olve to combat
<PB N="92" REF="93">
with this charming Lady, to whom they belong.</Q>
<Q>I am not only ready, Sire, to &s;urrender tho&s;e Arms to her, (&s;aid Made|moi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt,</HI> curte&s;ying low to the King, and advancing to &s;alute the Coun|te&s;s) but al&s;o to pay her that Homage, which a Beauty &s;o tran&s;cendant, has a Right to exact, from the whole World.</Q></P>
<P>Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt,</HI> eager to pre|vent any Su&s;picions of her being envious of her Rival's Perfections, was not aware that by forcing her&s;elf to prai&s;e her, &s;he had de&s;cended to Flattery. The Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> from the &s;ame Motive, fell into the &s;ame Fault, only that &s;he had a better Ex|cu&s;e for it, being in &s;ome Degree obliged to an&s;wer, her Rival's Compliment, with another.</P>
<P><Q>And what Homage is worthy of yours, Madam, (&s;aid &s;he, returning her Em|brace) which &s;hines with &s;o many Ad|vantages over me! Suffer me to acknow|ledge with Plea&s;ure, a Superiority which all that Look on you, will readily allow, and add one Triumph more, to the Numbers you have already enjoyed.</Q></P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the Thoughts of the&s;e rival Beauties, were very different from their Expre&s;&s;ions: for from that Mo|ment they beheld each other with Eyes of
<PB N="93" REF="94">
Jealou&s;y and Re&s;entment, and each &s;ecretly congratulated her&s;elf, for the Victory &s;he hoped to obtain over the other.</P>
<P>But the Heart of the Count of <HI>Polan,</HI> was in a Situation &s;till more extraordinary than the&s;e Ladies, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ively felt the In|fluence of each of their Charms, as he gazed upon them in Turn. Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Ge|vincourt's</HI> noble Air; the Spirit that &s;parkled in her Eyes, and pointed every Glance; the graceful Freedom of her Motion; the Vi|vacity that accompanied all her Words and Actions; and that charming Fiercene&s;s &s;o &s;uitable to the Peculiarity of her Character, filled him at once with Admiration, Awe and Love.</P>
<P>On the other Side, the langui&s;hing Sweet|ne&s;s of Madam <HI>de Berci;</HI> her Elegance of Per&s;on; the inchanting Sen&s;ibility which &s;treamed from her lovely Eyes; the Tone of her Voice, inexpre&s;&s;ibly &s;oft and moving, conveyed &s;uch Tenderne&s;s to his Heart, that while he gazed upon her, and heard her &s;peak, he was tran&s;ported out of him&s;elf, and lo&s;t in an Exta&s;y of mingled Pain and Plea&s;ure. The different Emotions the&s;e fair Ones excited in his incon&s;tant Brea&s;t, were &s;uitable to their different Graces. He loved Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt</HI> with Ar|dour, the Counte&s;s with Tenderne&s;s. When he looked upon the fair Amazon, his Heart glowed with impatient Wi&s;hes: when he
<PB N="94" REF="95">
gazed upon the Counte&s;s, he was melted to Softne&s;s. For the Per&s;on of Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt</HI> he langui&s;hed: but &s;ighed for the Heart of Madam <HI>de Berci.</HI> In a Word, he could have been plea&s;ed to live for the one; for the other he would have been content to die.</P>
<P>The Count of <HI>Berci,</HI> le&s;s wild, le&s;s a&s;|&s;uming, and more con&s;tant, felt the true Force of Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt's</HI> Charms, and from the fir&s;t Moment he beheld her, conceived a Pa&s;&s;ion for her, that Time never weakened, nor no new Object, ever changed.</P>
<P>This illu&s;trious Company, after taking Leave of their Maje&s;ties, retired greatly &s;a|tisfied with the new Pro&s;pects that were opened to them. All but Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt,</HI> who ob&s;erving the A&s;&s;iduity of the old Marquis <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> about the Coun|te&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> the Plea&s;ure with which he had gazed on her, during the Audience &s;he had of the King, and his Eagerne&s;s to give her his Hand when &s;he left their Maje&s;ties Apartment, conceived &s;o violent a Grief at Symptoms &s;o unfavourable to her Hopes of being his Niece, that &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the whole Night in Tears and Complaints.</P>
<P>She now concluded, &s;he was de&s;pi&s;ed by the Chevalier, and although he had never profe&s;&s;ed a Pa&s;&s;ion for her, accu&s;ed him of Perfidy and Fal&s;ehood. Her Mind being
<PB N="95" REF="96">
violently agitated with the&s;e Thoughts, &s;he called her Woman early in the Morning, and having &s;ent for the Armour which had been worn by the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> &s;he put it on, and attented only by her Woman, who was di&s;gui&s;ed in a Man's Habit, &s;he left <HI>Pa|ris</HI> with an Intention to go to <HI>Rouen,</HI> in Hopes of hearing &s;ome News of the Che|valier.</P>
<P>The Chevalier's Valet de Chambre, who &s;ome Days before had left <HI>Paris</HI> with the &s;ame De&s;ign, was already arrived in that Capital of <HI>Normandy,</HI> flattering him&s;elf, that among the great Number of Strangers which came to that Port, he &s;hould meet with &s;ome one from whom he might have a Cer|tainty of his Ma&s;ter's Fate.</P>
<P>He had the good Fortune to meet the Chevalier the Day after he came to <HI>Rouen:</HI> but, if he was tran&s;ported with Joy to &s;ee him, the News he brought concerning the Counte&s;s, were &s;o many Daggers to the Heart of the Chevalier. In the Letter which this faithful Dome&s;tic delivered him from his Mi&s;tre&s;s, he found nothing but Expre&s;|&s;ions of Indifference and Irony, &s;o much the more cruel, as it was extremely delicate, and appeared to be dictated by a Heart, entirely at Ea&s;e, or at lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible of no other Emo|tions, but Scorn and Indignation.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="97">This Letter, and the Accounts he received from his Servant, of the Extravagancies acted by the Counte&s;s, in the fir&s;t Tran&s;ports of her Jealou&s;y, gave him &s;o much Inquietude, that he re&s;olved to &s;et out immediately for <HI>Paris,</HI> and during the Journey he was con|tinually making his Valet de Chambre re|peat all that his Mi&s;tre&s;s had &s;aid and done, which had come to his Knowledge, and from tho&s;e Particulars, &s;ometimes drew &s;ome Alleviation for his Unea&s;ine&s;s, and &s;ome|times new Fears, that he had for ever lo&s;t her Affection.</P>
<P>He was now within two Days Journey of <HI>Paris,</HI> when he met a Cavalier in Armour, followed by a young Man, and both riding in a great Hurry; as &s;oon as the Chevalier's Valet perceived them, he knew the Armour to be the &s;ame that had been worn by the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> and did not doubt but it was &s;he her&s;elf, who had once more &s;tolen from her Relations, and was going to <HI>Rouen</HI> in Search of the Chevalier: he immediately communicated his Su&s;picions to his Ma&s;ter, who fond of believing what he wi&s;hed, eager|ly advanced to meet the di&s;gui&s;ed Lady, and rai&s;ing the Vi&s;or of his Helmet, for he was in Armour, he bowed down, even to his Hor&s;e's Mane, and in a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Tone, in|treated to be heard a few Moments in his Defence.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="98">Mademoi&s;elle de <HI>Gevincourt,</HI> for it was &s;he, overjoyed at this Meeting, and at his taking her for the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> re&s;olved to profit by his Mi&s;take, and di&s;cover his real Sentiments with regard to her and her Rival. She therefore affected a di&s;dainful &s;ilence, left the Tone of her Voice &s;hould make her known to him, and waving her Hand as if &s;he was re&s;olved not to li&s;ten to his Excu&s;es, attempted to pa&s;s without &s;tay|ing for any farther Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The Chevalier, in De&s;pair at &s;uch cruel Treatment, threw him&s;elf in&s;tantly off his Hor&s;e, and fa&s;tening upon the Bridle of hers whom he &s;uppo&s;ed to be his Mi&s;tre&s;s, told her that for her Service he had attempted Things the mo&s;t difficult, and from the Time he had fir&s;t attached him&s;elf to her, had nothing to reproach him&s;elf with: he added that if any Reports had reached her Ear, relating to his Pa&s;&s;ion for Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt,</HI> he could a&s;&s;ure her they were ab&s;olutely fal&s;e; that through Complai&s;ance for his Uncle, he had vi&s;ited that young Lady &s;everal times, becau&s;e he found it plea&s;ed him: but how great &s;oever her Merit might be, it could make no Impre&s;&s;ion on a Heart long &s;ince devoted to her, and incapable of Change.
<Q>For, oh my adored Counte&s;s! (pur&s;ued he melting into Tenderne&s;s) there cannot be in my Opinion a Woman upon Earth that does not yield to you in Beau|ty; how improbable is it then, that I
<PB N="98" REF="99">
&s;hould for&s;ake you for Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt,</HI> who is &s;o infinitely your In|feriour as well in the Graces of Mind as Per&s;on.</Q></P>
<P>The Chevalier, &s;till thinking he talked to the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> was going on with a Di&s;cour&s;e &s;o mortifying for Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt,</HI> when &s;he, &s;welling with mingled Rage and Grief, no longer able to hear her Rival &s;o openly preferred to her by a Man who &s;he thought had loved her with an Ex+ce&s;s of Tenderne&s;s, turned a&s;ide her Head, and &s;hedding a Torrent of Tears, pro|nounced in a low Voice the Words, <HI>Traitor, perfidious, cruel!</HI></P>
<P>The Chevalier &s;en&s;ibly affected with that mournful Action and tho&s;e complaining Accents which he could &s;carce di&s;tingui&s;h, was going to throw him&s;elf on his Knees, and &s;olemnly prote&s;t that he had never been guilty of the Infidelity &s;he accu&s;ed him of, when the fair Amazon, reflecting upon the Contempt with which &s;he had heard her&s;elf treated, gave a Loo&s;e to Indignation and De&s;pair. The De&s;ire of revenging her Wrongs, or of dying by the Hand of her unworthy Lover, that &s;o &s;he might fill him with eternal Remor&s;e and Angui&s;h, now wholly po&s;&s;e&s;t her, and dictated &s;uch a Re|ply as &s;he knew would bring him to the Point &s;he wi&s;hed for.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="100">'How art thou deceived!' &s;aid &s;he, af|fecting a &s;cornful Tone, and di&s;gui&s;ing her Voice as much as po&s;&s;ible:
<Q>She, to whom the&s;e fine Speeches are addre&s;t, is no more: her frantick Pa&s;&s;ion for thee brought her in a ridiculous Di&s;gui&s;e to try the Force of my Arm. The Death of &s;o contemp|tible an Enemy would have given me Pain, had I not known that it would be an eternal Source of Mi&s;ery to thee, whom I am bound to hate. For know to thy Terror, I am the Count of <HI>Polan,</HI> the Brother of him whom thou ha&s;t treache|rou&s;ly murdered, and who has &s;ought thee eagerly, that I may &s;acrifice thee to my ju&s;t Revenge.</Q></P>
<P>The Chevalier, who at the Beginning of this Speech was &s;truck with Horror, Amaze|ment and De&s;pair, remained immoveable for a Moment with his Eyes fixed on the &s;uppo&s;ed horrid Murderer of his beloved Counte&s;s. But the Fury that &s;uddenly po&s;|&s;e&s;t him &s;uppre&s;t tho&s;e fir&s;t Emotions, and the De&s;ire of &s;acrificing the Mon&s;ter who had robbed the World of &s;uch Excellence, made him give a Truce to Grief till Ven|gance was &s;atisfied. With a Rapidity like Lightning he leaped upon his Hor&s;e and drawing his Sword in the &s;ame In|&s;tant he ru&s;hed forwards with an Excla|mation that expre&s;&s;ed the Rage which ani|mated him, and di&s;charged &s;o heavy a Blow on the Helmet of the fair Amazon as pier|ced
<PB N="100" REF="101">
quite through it and made a large Wound in her Head.</P>
<P>Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt</HI> feeling her Blood i&s;&s;ue from the Wound, was tran|&s;ported with a Fury equal to her Enemy, and as he lifted up his Arm to redouble his Stroke, &s;he run her Sword in his Side, and gave him a very large, tho' not a mor|tal Wound. This Combat, which was continued with more Rage and Animo&s;ity than Art, was too violent to la&s;t long: their Attendants were Witne&s;&s;es of the dreadful Spectacle, and knew not what they ought to do. The Woman trembled for the Danger her Lady was in, and the faithful Valet de Chambre thought that Glory and Succe&s;s had now for&s;aken his Ma&s;ter. But the Chevalier, who after the Lo&s;s of his Mi&s;tre&s;s rated his Life at no|thing, pre&s;&s;ed his Adver&s;ary with redoubled Vigour, and at length wounding her deeply under the right Brea&s;t &s;he &s;taggered on her Saddle, her Eyes &s;wam, her Strength for|&s;ook her, her Sword dropt from her Hand, and &s;he fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s to the Earth.</P>
<P>Her Woman who eagerly ran to receive her in her Arms, and break her Fall, with loud Cries conjured the Chevalier to &s;top his Fury. But he who was re&s;olved not to let the Murderer of his Mi&s;tre&s;s live, leaped off his Hor&s;e, and running to his fal|len Enemy tore off the Helmet with eager

<P>His Sword which he held aloft and ready to fall upon his pro&s;trate Foe, now dropped from his trembling Hand, he &s;tepped back a few Paces, and cla&s;ping his Hands toge|ther in an Agony of Grief, contemplated a few Moments the bleeding fair One who lay &s;en&s;ele&s;s and without Motion upon the Ground.</P>
<P>A thou&s;and bitter Reflections aro&s;e in his Mind, one Moment he raved at his Valet de Chambre for leading him into &s;o fatal an Error, another he complained of Made|moi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt</HI> for a&s;&s;uming the Name of his mortal Enemy and urging his Fury by declaring he was the Murderer of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci.</HI></P>

in Defence of your Innocence, and fought with your mo&s;t cruel Enemy to pre&s;erve your Honour. She nobly a&s;&s;erted your In|nocence in the Pre&s;ence of the whole Court, and undertook to defend your Fame again&s;t all who &s;hould attempt to traduce it; &s;o many Obligations ought to have induced you to have &s;poke le&s;s &s;lightingly of her, even to your Mi&s;tre&s;s: you &s;hould not in any Circum&s;tance have forgot that &s;he for whom you &s;o openly di&s;|avowed any Regard, had hazarded Fame, Happine&s;s and Life, to &s;ecure tho&s;e Bene|fits to you.</Q></P>
<P>The Chevalier, tho' &s;hocked to the Soul with the&s;e Reproaches, yet found too much Ju&s;tice in them to be offended with the forward Zeal of her who uttered them: but ob&s;erving that Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevin|court</HI> lo&s;t much Blood, he cau&s;ed her to be carried to a neighbouring Village, where they happily found a Surgeon, who after examining her Wounds declared they were neither mortal, nor dangerous. The Che|valier &s;taid till her Wounds were dre&s;t, and till he heard &s;he was laid in Bed, and then recommending her to the Care of the Sur|geon, he &s;et out immediately for <HI>Paris.</HI> Not having Courage and Re&s;olution enough to a&s;k Pardon of her whom without knowing he had &s;o cruelly treated; be&s;ides, he was afraid that the Sight of him might give her Emotions which would produce &s;ome dan|gerous
<PB N="103" REF="104">
Alteration in her Health; he there|fore intreated her Woman to make his Ex|cu&s;es to her with all imaginable Submi&s;&s;ion, and to a&s;&s;ure her, that he was in extreme Affliction at what his unhappy Mi&s;take had made him commit again&s;t her, and that there was no puni&s;hment &s;o &s;evere to which he &s;hould not &s;ubmit, to atone for a Crime which however &s;he mu&s;t know was involuntary.</P>
<P>The Evening being pretty far advanced when the Chevalier left this Village, he did not reach <HI>Mante</HI> till late at Night. His Mind &s;till more fatigued than his Body, Grief for the Condition to which he had reduced Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt,</HI> and his Anxiety about his beloved Counte&s;s, equally engro&s;&s;ed him; yet the Certainty that &s;he was not dead, as he had &s;o lately believed, gave him in the Mid&s;t of his In|quietude a Joy which more than compen|&s;ated for the Torments he had &s;uffered.</P>
<P>It happened that the Ma&s;ter of the Inn, at which he alighted, was ju&s;t returned from <HI>Paris,</HI> with a Gentleman who had accom|panied him. The Chevalier, who in the pre&s;ent unea&s;y State of his Mind, found Solitude extremely di&s;agreeable, invited them both to Supper with him. The Di&s;cour&s;e turning upon the News of the Court, the Gentleman, among other Anecdotes, re|lated all that had happened at the Combat
<PB N="104" REF="105">
between the Count of <HI>Polan,</HI> and the fair Amazon &s;o celebrated at <HI>Paris;</HI> he like|wi&s;e mentioned the &s;trange Adventure of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> how, after &s;he had appeared in Armour in the Li&s;ts, &s;he &s;uddenly &s;tole away from the A&s;&s;embly, and retired to <HI>E&s;tam|pes,</HI> where her Hor&s;e and Armour were found; that the King, at the Reque&s;t of Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt,</HI> had committed the Armour to the Guard of that fair Warrior, and re|&s;erved to him&s;elf the Cognizance of the Cau&s;e of the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> and Ma|dam <HI>de Berci.</HI></P>
<P>He then went on to give an Account of that Lady's Return to Court, the Count of <HI>Polan's</HI> renewed Pa&s;&s;ion for her, and that it was the common Opinion &s;he would be married to that young Nobleman.</P>
<P>The Chevalier turned pale at this Di&s;|cour&s;e, and di&s;covered &s;o much Unea&s;ine&s;s, that the Gentleman &s;uppo&s;ing the Alteration he perceived in him, proceeded from the Pain of his Wound, advi&s;ed him to go to Bed immediately. But the Chevalier a&s;&s;ur|ing him that he &s;uffered no Inconvenience from his Wound, which was very &s;light, begged him to relate all he knew concern|ing the Count of <HI>Polan,</HI> and Madam <HI>de Berci.</HI></P>
<P><Q>Sir, (an&s;wered the Gentleman) all I know more of the Affair is, that it was
<PB N="105" REF="106">
&s;aid the Count of <HI>Polan</HI> had made very advantageous Offers to the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> the Father of Madam <HI>de Berci;</HI> that the King is de&s;irous that this Marriage &s;hould go forward; and the pub|lick Cry is, that the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> who it is known had a Pa&s;&s;ion for the Cheva|lier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> cannot with Decency mar|ry a Man who has been accu&s;ed of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nating her Hu&s;band.</Q></P>
<P>'But what if his Innocence be proved!' Replied the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> ha&s;tily.</P>
<P><Q>That does not hinder &s;uch a Marriage from being very improper (returned the Gentleman.) Calumny, tho' unju&s;t, al|ways leave a Kind of Stain behind, in the &s;ame manner as a Wound, tho' perfectly cured, is always followed by a &s;car.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But is it po&s;&s;ible, (re&s;umed the Cheva|lier) that a Man, who has &s;aved the Lives of that Lady's Father and Brother, who made a Voyage to <HI>Africa</HI> to de|liver her Hu&s;band from Slavery, &s;hould be forgot for the Count of <HI>Polan,</HI> who not only never rendered her any Service, but has alway been the declared Enemy of her Family?</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is &s;aid (interrupted the Gentleman) that the young Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> Brother to the Counte&s;s, talks loudly
<PB N="106" REF="107">
again&s;t this Match. As for the Counte&s;s, &s;he has not as yet declared her Re&s;o|lution; but her Father and the re&s;t of her Friends being all in the Count of <HI>Polan's</HI> Intere&s;t, it is believed this Af|fair will be concluded agreeable to the King's De&s;ire.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e Words were like &s;o many Dag|gers in the Heart of the Chevalier. No longer able to conceal the Violence of his Emotions, he retired to his Chamber and threw him&s;elf into Bed: but tortured as he was with &s;o many cruel Reflections, he could take no Repo&s;e; he ro&s;e early in the Morning, without having once clo&s;ed his Eyes the whole Night, and rode to <HI>Pa|ris</HI> with all the po&s;&s;ible Expedition.</P>
<P>The Situation of Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Ge|vincourt</HI> was &s;till more to be pitied, than that of the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> for Hope had not yet abandoned him, and he with Rea&s;on expected, that his Pre&s;ence would produce &s;ome favourable Alteration in the Minds of his Mi&s;tre&s;s and her Relations: but that unfortunate young Lady was too well a&s;&s;ured, that &s;he had for ever lo&s;t the Man whom &s;he loved to Di&s;traction: when &s;he recovered out of her Swoon, Remem|brance and Reflexion returned, &s;he ca&s;t her langui&s;hing Looks round the Room, and not &s;eeing that dear Enemy any longer near
<PB N="107" REF="108">
her, &s;he abandoned her&s;elf to the mo&s;t bit|ter Complaints.</P>
<P>Her Woman, approaching her Bed, deli|vered the Chevalier's Me&s;&s;age to her.</P>
<P><Q>What then! (eagerly interrupted Ma|demoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt</HI>) he is gone with|out deigning to &s;ay a &s;ingle Word to her whom he had reduced to &s;o cruel a Con|dition. Barbarian! Humanity, if not Ten|derne&s;s and E&s;teem, obliged him to re|main with me till the Wounds I had re|ceived from his cruel Hand, were cured. Ah! Wretch, ungrateful and unkind! for him I left my Country, expo&s;ed my Life and Fame to a thou&s;and Dangers: For him I appeared in Arms, defended his Innocence, and pre&s;erved his Honour; and is it thus he requites me?</Q></P>
<P>Here a violent Bur&s;t of Tears &s;topped her Voice. Her Woman a&s;&s;ured her that he him&s;elf &s;eemed &s;inking under &s;uch a Load of Woe, that his Pre&s;ence would have given her more Pain than Relief.</P>
<P><Q>He was afflicted thou &s;ay&s;t, (replied Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt</HI>) and how did he expre&s;s that Affliction? He left me &s;en&s;ele&s;s, dead in appearance, &s;taid not till he knew, whether I &s;hould ever again &s;ee the Light of Day. Ah! the ingrate, the perfidious Wretch! Why do I not
<PB N="108" REF="109">
hate him? Why do I not ca&s;t him from my Remembrance, or only think of him with Horror and Dete&s;tation? But, alas! (pur&s;ued &s;he after a little Pau&s;e,) I feel I love him &s;till, ba&s;e as he is; his Life is dearer to me than my own: could I be a&s;&s;ured that he is really afflicted for the Mi&s;eries he has cau&s;ed me, my Heart would be at Re&s;t. I mu&s;t &s;ee him once more, my <HI>Maria,</HI> (&s;aid &s;he &s;ighing and pre&s;&s;ing her Hand,) if thou love&s;t me or de&s;ire&s;t that I &s;hould redouble my Affection for thee, thou mu&s;t ha&s;ten after this Ingrate: he cannot yet be got far on his Journey. Intreat him not to fly from her to whom he owes &s;o many Obligations. Alas! to what am I re|duced? But Pride is now no more, I have been neglected, &s;corned, treated with Cruelty by the Man I love, and my Ri|val openly preferred before me. But tell him, that I no longer pretend to his Love; his Promi&s;es, for &s;o I under&s;tood them, tell him, I acquit him of: a&s;&s;ure him that I will not attempt to traver&s;e his Pa&s;&s;ion for the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci;</HI> but, if need be, will &s;olicit this happy Rival in his Favour, and will employ all the Credit and Intere&s;t I have at Court to &s;ecure his Marriage: only let him again re|turn; let me not have the Mortification to think he could abandon me in the &s;ad Condition to which he him&s;elf has re|duced me. Ah! why &s;hould he di&s;cover
<PB N="109" REF="110">
&s;uch Cruelty towards me? I am not of the Number of tho&s;e who have accu&s;ed him of ba&s;ely killing the Count of <HI>Polan;</HI> I never charged him with the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tion of his Friend: I have publickly, and in a Manner un&s;uitable to my Sex, de|fended not only his Innocence, but that of his Mi&s;tre&s;s. Do I not de&s;erve, that he &s;hould e&s;teem, if he cannot love me? And his E&s;teem is all I a&s;k. Tell him &s;o, my dear <HI>Maria;</HI> and tell him that his Pre&s;ence will contribute to the Cure of tho&s;e Wounds he has given me; and if he will have the Patience to wait but two Days, I &s;hall be able to accom|pany him to <HI>Paris,</HI> where it is po&s;&s;ible I may be of &s;ome Service to him.

<P>The faithful Girl, who loved her Mi&s;|tre&s;s tenderly, &s;taid no longer than to a&s;&s;ure her, &s;he would bring back the Chevalier or lo&s;e her Life in the Attempt. And then mounting her Hor&s;e, although Darkne&s;s had now over&s;pread the Earth, &s;he galloped with the utmo&s;t &s;peed after the Chevalier, and overtook him ju&s;t as he left <HI>Mante,</HI> and was proceeding towards <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="111">The Chevalier was greatly &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee her, and fearing &s;he brought him an Account of her Lady's Death, he remained &s;ilent and immoveable for &s;ome Moments, not daring to a&s;k a Que&s;tion which he dreaded to be re&s;olved. But when &s;he had delivered her Me&s;&s;age, tho' his Heart was agreeably relieved from the torturing Su&s;pen&s;e it had laboured under, yet in the Perplexity to which it reduced him he found inexpre&s;&s;ible Angui&s;h.</P>
<P>On the one Side, he reflected upon the cruel Ingratitude of refu&s;ing to go back a few Leagues at the Reque&s;t of a Lady who had travelled above two hundred for him, that Lady too illu&s;trious by Birth, her Merit and her Beauty, to whom he owed Obligations of the highe&s;t Na|ture, and who was langui&s;hing with the Wounds he had (unde&s;ignedly indeed) given her.</P>
<P>But on the other Side, the raging Jea|lou&s;y of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> the extra|vagant Things which Pa&s;&s;ion had made her act, her Letter &s;o cruelly conceived to tor|ment and mortify him, his Terrors left the Marquis her Father &s;hould take advan|tage of his Ab&s;ence to prevail upon her to marry the Count of <HI>Polan,</HI> all this ru&s;hed forcibly upon his Imagination; and fixing his wavering re&s;olution, he began to make an Apology to Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt</HI>'s
<PB N="111" REF="112">
Woman for not being able to attend her Lady. But that faithful Girl would not hear him out, &s;he threw her&s;elf on her Knees before the Chevalier, and painted her Lady's Grief and De&s;pair, and his own Ingratitude, if he refu&s;ed to comply with her Reque&s;ts, in &s;uch lively Colours, that the Chevalier, who&s;e Heart was totally &s;oftened by her affecting Arguments, turned his Hor&s;e's Head, and rode with all po&s;&s;ible Expedition towards the Village where he had left Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt.</HI></P>
<P>That unfortunate fair One, who had pa&s;&s;ed the Time in a cruel Anxiety, divided between Hope and Fear, and longing yet dreading the Return of her Me&s;&s;enger, no &s;ooner &s;aw her enter the Chamber followed by the Chevalier, than Joy producing the &s;ame Effects as Grief, &s;o forcibly operated upon her now weakened Mind, that &s;he fell into a Swoon from which &s;he was with Difficulty recovered. The fir&s;t Ob|ject &s;he beheld, when &s;he opened her Eyes, was the Chevalier kneeling by her Bed-&s;ide, and bathing one of her Hands which he held fa&s;t cla&s;ped in his with his Tears.</P>
<P>Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt</HI> agitated by a little Emotion of Anger, which &s;he could not re&s;i&s;t, ha&s;tly withdrew her Hand, and the Chevalier ri&s;ing re&s;pectfully, retired a few paces gazing on her with profound At|tention, and all the Marks of an unfeigned
<PB N="112" REF="113">
Sorrow deeply impre&s;&s;ed upon his Coun|tenance.</P>
<P>Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt</HI> found her Re&s;entment in&s;tantly &s;ub&s;ide at &s;uch a Proof of the Chevalier's Sen&s;ibility. He advanced a little to her Bed&s;ide, and twice attempted to &s;peak, but his Confu&s;ion was &s;o great, that his Voice died upon his Lips. He was not able to utter a Word, and he could only by Sighs and melancholy Regards upon the wounded fair One expre&s;s the tender Emotions of his Soul.</P>
<P>Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt,</HI> who heed|fully ob&s;erved him, was better &s;atisfied with this dumb Eloquence, and the Di&s;order &s;he was capable of exciting in &s;uch a noble Mind, than &s;he would have been with the mo&s;t elaborate Di&s;cour&s;e. She now par|doned all he had done again&s;t her: her Eyes lo&s;t all their Fiercene&s;s, and &s;he beheld him with a Look of mingled Sweetne&s;s and Compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Chevalier, in &s;ome Degree relieved from his Confu&s;ion by her &s;oftened Glances, again kneeling took her Hand, and pre&s;&s;ing it re&s;pectfully to his Lips,</P>
<P><Q>I take Heaven to Witne&s;s, Mademoi|&s;elle (&s;aid he) that my Will had no Part in the Outrage you have received from
<PB N="113" REF="114">
me; and that, to expiate it, I would free|ly &s;acrifice my Life.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Chevalier, (&s;aid the beauteous Warrior) your greate&s;t Offence again&s;t me was committed long ago: then, then, you in|jured me, when your fatal Arts impo&s;ed upon my Credulity, and en&s;nared my Heart; that is the Outrage I have mo&s;t Rea&s;on to complain of. The Wounds your Sword has made, are &s;light com|pared with the Pangs my Heart has &s;uf|fered. But 'tis pa&s;t; I no longer pretend to any Thing but your Friend&s;hip. Your beloved Counte&s;s, jealous as &s;he is, will not refu&s;e me that; I can do Ju&s;tice to her Merit, tho' I was once her Rival, and confe&s;s that my Pride is not wounded by the Preference you have given her to me. She de&s;erves your tendere&s;t Affec|tion, may you be happy in each other, nor need it be interrupted by your gene|rous Concern for me. I am not ca|pable of feeling a Pa&s;&s;ion for a Man who&s;e, Heart is another's. If I loved it was in con&s;equence of a Per&s;ua&s;ion that I was beloved, and that by a Per&s;on who merited the Regard I had for him; my Pa&s;&s;ion was founded upon Gratitude and E&s;teem: the fir&s;t cau&s;e no longer &s;ub&s;i&s;ts. I have no Motive for Gratitude, tho' I have for E&s;teem. You have my Friend&s;hip becau&s;e your noble Qualities merit it, my Love can only be de&s;erved by one, who
<PB N="114" REF="115">
be&s;ides tho&s;e noble Qualities has a Heart to be&s;tow, and makes me Mi&s;tre&s;s of it.</Q></P>
<P>The Chevalier, charmed with the Wit and Spirit of Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt,</HI> expre&s;&s;ed his Admiration of her in Terms which greatly flattered her Self-love. He vowed ever to pre&s;erve an inviolable Friend|&s;hip for her, and accepted the Offer of hers with a Tran&s;port of Joy and Gratitude. He a&s;&s;ured her that he would be ever ready to &s;acrifice that Life &s;he had been plea&s;ed to take an Intere&s;t in, for her Service; and readily con&s;ented, notwith&s;tanding his Im|patience to &s;ee his dear Counte&s;s, to expect the Cure of her Wounds, which he never mentioned without Emotion, that he might have the Honour to conduct her to <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>This In&s;tance of his Ardour to plea&s;e her, contributed more than any Thing el&s;e to re&s;tore her to Tranquility, her Body &s;oon felt the Effects of the Quiet of her Mind. In three Days &s;he was able to &s;it her Hor&s;e, and on the fourth &s;he complai&s;antly offered to accompany him to <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>The Chevalier eagerly embraced her Pro|po&s;al, and after a &s;hort Preparation, they &s;et out together. Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevin|court</HI> being &s;o lately recovered, the Che|valier in&s;i&s;ted upon making ea&s;y Journies, yet his Heart panted with impatience to be in <HI>Paris,</HI> and it co&s;t him a great
<PB N="115" REF="116">
deal to &s;hew this Complai&s;ance. However on the Evening of the third Day after their leaving the Village they arrived in that great Capital of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The Chevalier, who was no longer in fear of the Pur&s;uits of the Officers of Ju&s;tice, propo&s;ed to alight at his own Hotel, and offered Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt</HI> the riche&s;t Apartment in it: but the fair Amazon pru|dently declined his Offer, and the Cheva|lier attended her to the Hou&s;e &s;he had be|fore re&s;ided in, and went home with a Heart filled with eager Anxiety, and trembling between Hope and Fear.</P>
<P>He &s;ent immediately a Me&s;&s;age to the young Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> reque&s;ting to &s;ee him. That faithful Friend, in a Rapture of Joy, flew to attend his Summons. The Chevalier and he held each other a long time embraced; the young Marquis wept with Tenderne&s;s and Delight at &s;o happy a Meeting with a Friend whom he had given over for lo&s;t; and the Chevalier, melted at the tender Reception he found from the Brother of her whom he pa&s;|&s;ionately loved, &s;uffered the big Tear to &s;tream from his manlier Eye as he cla&s;ped him to his Brea&s;t, and a&s;&s;ured him that his Life was endeared to him by the Value he &s;et upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="117">When their fir&s;t Tran&s;ports were &s;ub|&s;ided, they gave each other a mutual Ac|count of what had happened to them &s;ince their &s;eparation. The young Marquis was very particular in all that related to his Si&s;ter, and the Chevalier was &s;o happy as to find by his Di&s;cour&s;e that mo&s;t Part of the afflict|ing News related to him by the Gentleman at <HI>Mante</HI> was fal&s;e.</P>
<P>The Marquis owned that the Count of <HI>Polan</HI> had profe&s;t a Pa&s;&s;ion for his Si&s;ter, that the Coldne&s;s and Re&s;erve, with which &s;he had treated him, had induced him to direct his A&s;&s;iduities to Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt,</HI>
<Q>by whom, as it &s;hould &s;eem, &s;aid he his Heart was &s;urpri&s;ed when &s;he valiantly fought with him in your De|fence: but &s;ince her Departure, the waver|ing Count has again addre&s;t my Si&s;ter, who, I a&s;&s;ure you upon my Honour, looks upon him with perfect Indifference, nor does he meet with Encouragement from any of our Family; and it is the King alone who &s;eems de&s;irous the Match &s;hould go forward.</Q></P>
<P>This News re&s;tored Peace to the Heart of this once wretched Lover. He intreated the Marquis to bring <HI>Verague</HI> with him early in the Morning to his Hotel; and it was agreed, that the Chevalier, attended by all his Friends, &s;hould pre&s;ent him&s;elf at the <HI>Louvre</HI> and fully ju&s;tify his Inno|cence,
<PB N="117" REF="118">
and that of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> by the Evidence of <HI>Verague.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly the next Morning the Mar|quis <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> tran&s;ported with Joy at the Return of his beloved Nephew, came to his Hotel with Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt,</HI> Me&s;&s;ieurs <HI>de Saint Sauveur,</HI> and the Count of <HI>Berci,</HI> who brought with him the un|happy <HI>Verague.</HI> They went altogether to the <HI>Louvre:</HI> and being introduced into his Maje&s;ty's Pre&s;ence, the fair Amazon taking the Chevalier by the Hand, approached the King, and pre&s;enting him to his Maje&s;ty:
<Q>Sire, (&s;aid &s;he) behold the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> who comes to throw him&s;elf at your Feet, not as a guilty Man who wants to implore your Pardon, but as a faithful Subject, who, having by cruel Calumnies been too long bani&s;hed from your royal Pre&s;ence, returns with Joy to con&s;ecrate the Remainder of his Life to your Service: he brings with him an authentic Te&s;ti|mony of his Innocence, and therefore hopes, he may again be thought worthy to employ his Arms for you, which, when bani&s;hed and pro&s;cribed, he never would do for your Enemies.</Q></P>
<P>All the Courtiers who were pre&s;ent, as well as the Friends of the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;|&s;ars,</HI> &s;ecretly applauded this &s;pirited Speech of the charming Amazon. The King was plea&s;ed with it, and &s;miled benignantly upon
<PB N="118" REF="119">
her, but made no An&s;wer: for the Cheva|lier &s;hewing <HI>Verague,</HI> and throwing him&s;elf at his Feet, thus &s;poke:</P>
<P><Q>This unhappy Man, Sire, will declare to your Maje&s;ty, who was the real A&s;&s;a&s;|&s;in of a Friend who&s;e Fate has co&s;t me &s;o many Tears, and loaded me with &s;o many Di&s;graces. If, after his Te&s;timony is heard, any doubt &s;hould remain of my Innocence, and that of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> I am ready to defend her Fame, and my own, with my Sword, as your Ma|je&s;ty had before permitted I &s;hould do: nor do I owe le&s;s Vengeance to tho&s;e who have &s;o maliciou&s;ly accu&s;ed me without Foundation, &s;ince by it they have forced me to abandon my native Country, and pa&s;s many Months of my Life in the Di&s;|plea&s;ure of the greate&s;t and the be&s;t of Kings.</Q></P>
<P>Here the Chevalier cea&s;ed &s;peaking: the King graciou&s;ly commanded him to ri&s;e, and looking upon <HI>Verague,</HI> a&s;ked him, what he had to declare concerning the Death of the late Count of <HI>Berci?</HI></P>
<P>That unhappy Man, throwing him&s;elf at the King's Feet with Tears, confe&s;&s;ed, that he was the &s;ole Author of the Count's Death: he related his criminal Intrigue with <HI>Ma|rianne,</HI> the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci's</HI> Woman, the Danger &s;he had been in of being di&s;carded with

Infamy by her Lady on that Account, and of the young Count of <HI>Berci's</HI> Interpo&s;ition in her Favour, which procured her a Pardon on Condition &s;he behaved well for the future.</P>
<P>He added, that taking an Opportunity to vi&s;it his Mi&s;tre&s;s when the Count and his Lady were at an Entertainment, given by the Marquis <HI>de Saint Sauveur</HI> on account of his Son's Marriage, the &s;udden and un|expected Return of Mon&s;ieur and Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> put them in the utmo&s;t Con&s;terna|tion; that endeavouring to make his E&s;cape, he was &s;eized by the Count in the Dark, and anxious for the Pre&s;ervation of his Mi&s;|tre&s;s's Honour, and finding no other Way to di&s;engage him&s;elf, he attempted to wound the Count in the Arm by which he held him, but that unfortunate Nobleman, by a &s;udden Motion, received it in his Brea&s;t, and it proved mortal to his eternal Remor&s;e and Grief.</P>
<P>Here Tears for a few Moments drowned his Voice; but recovering him&s;elf a little, he added, that, not being able to bear the Stings of his own Con&s;cience, which per|petually reproached him not only with the Count's Murder, but the unju&s;t Sufferings of Madam <HI>de Berci,</HI> and the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> on that Account, he came volun|tarily, and delivered him&s;elf up to the Che|valier: and having now ju&s;tified his Inno|cence, and that of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> he
<PB N="120" REF="121">
was ready to &s;uffer the Puni&s;hment the Law ordains for Crimes like his.</P>
<P>The King, &s;urpri&s;ed at this Confe&s;&s;ion, ordered <HI>Marianne</HI> to be immediately brought into his Pre&s;ence, and confronted with her Lover, to the End that nothing might be wanting for the full Ju&s;tification of the Coun|te&s;s and Chevalier.</P>
<P>The unhappy Wretch, too &s;ecure in the Succe&s;s her vile Arts had hitherto met with, to dread any Di&s;covery from, &s;o unexpected a Que&s;tion, was &s;eized by the Exempt of the Guards, di&s;patched by the King for that Purpor&s;e, without any Difficulty, and was brought to the <HI>Louvre,</HI> where, when &s;he beheld <HI>Verague,</HI> all her Confidence for&s;aking her, &s;he threw her&s;elf on her Knees before the King, and with Tears and Groans con|fe&s;&s;ed all the Circum&s;tances <HI>Verague</HI> had before declared, but implored a Pardon with clamorous Prayers.</P>
<P>The King, perfectly &s;atisfied with the Confe&s;&s;ion of the two Criminals, annulled all the Proceedings again&s;t the Chevalier and the Counte&s;s, and moved with Com|pa&s;&s;ion for the unfortunate <HI>Verague</HI> who&s;e Crime, as it was involuntary, admitted of &s;ome extenuation and was likewi&s;e atoned for, by his &s;incere Repentance and accu&s;ing him|&s;elf to clear the Chevalier and the Counte&s;s. His Maje&s;ty in Con&s;ideration of all this,
<PB N="121" REF="122">
granted him his Life, but bani&s;hed him from <HI>France</HI> for ever. The infamous <HI>Ma|rianne</HI> was condemned to be &s;hut up between four Walls, for the re&s;t of her Life, and only Su&s;tenance enough allowed her, to keep her from &s;tarving, that &s;he might have Lei&s;ure to repent of the Enormity of her Crimes, and make her Peace with Heaven.</P>
<P>When his Maje&s;ty had pronounced the&s;e different Sentences, the Marqui&s;es <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> and <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> approached and, with all Humility thanked the King for the Ju&s;tice he had done the Counte&s;s and the Chevalier.</P>
<P>The Friends of the latter now gave free utterance to the Expre&s;&s;ions of their Joy for his happy Return, and this publick Proof of his Innocence. But the Chevalier eager to pre&s;ent him&s;elf to his dear Counte&s;s, on whom his Eyes were almo&s;t always fixed, di&s;engaged him&s;elf at length, and advanced towards her with a tender Awe: but &s;he who had with the &s;evere&s;t Pangs of Jealou&s;y &s;een his Entrance with the fair Amazon, and heard her Addre&s;s to the King in his Favour, gave way to the Impetuo&s;ity of her Rage, and when he bowed to her with the utmo&s;t Reverence as to a Deity, turned di&s;dainfully from him, and without deigning to give him a Look, fell into Di&s;cour&s;e with the Count of <HI>Polan</HI> who &s;tood near her, while the Chevalier &s;truck dumb and immovable
<PB N="122" REF="123">
by &s;uch an In&s;tance of Contempt, continued a few Moments gazing upon her as if he doubted whether the Woman who treated him in that Manner, was really the Coun|te&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> whom he had &s;o faithfully adored, and by whom he had once ima|gined him&s;elf tenderly beloved. Pride and Re&s;entment now came to fortify his Heart again&s;t the Grief he felt at &s;uch an Alte|ration: after ca&s;ting a Look full of Con|tempt upon his Rival, and Indifference on his Mi&s;tre&s;s, he mixed among a croud of La|dies by whom he was received with &s;uch an emulative Re&s;pect and Di&s;tinction, as &s;ent Daggers to the Heart of the capri|cious Counte&s;s, who now repented of the ra&s;h Folly &s;he had been guilty of, and un|able longer to &s;tay in the Pre&s;ence, &s;he went away &s;o &s;uddenly, that the Chevalier, who angry, as he was, could not help often turning his Eye towards her, was &s;urpri&s;ed when he found &s;he was gone. It gave him &s;ome Satisfaction to find the Count of <HI>Polan</HI> &s;till there; for Madam <HI>de Berci,</HI> unwilling to aggravate the Fault &s;he had been guilty of, would not admit of his At|tending her to her Coach, but reque&s;ted that Service from her Brother. The Chevalier, who had found it difficult to &s;uppre&s;s his Emotions, and &s;upport that Gaiety and Un|concern he had a&s;&s;umed while he was in the Sight of his ungrateful Mi&s;tre&s;s, took the fir&s;t Opportunity to retire, and was con|ducted by his Uncle and the Marquis <HI>de
<PB N="123" REF="124">
Saint-Sauveur</HI> to his Hotel, where he re|ceived from that tender Parent and faithful Friend a thou&s;and endearing Te&s;timonies of un&s;eigned Affection.</P>
<P>Mean time the Count of <HI>Berci,</HI> who be|came every day more charmed with Made|moi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt,</HI> was anxious for the Chevalier's Marriage with his Si&s;ter-in-law, that he might no longer have &s;uch a formi|dable Rival in the Affections of his Mi&s;|tre&s;s. He had a Conference with the young Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> on that Subject, and repre&s;enting to him that it was Time the Chevalier's faithful Pa&s;&s;ion, which to him had been productive of &s;o many Mis|fortunes, and &s;o many brave and generous Services to the Counte&s;s and her Family, &s;hould be rewarded with the Prize he had &s;o well de&s;erved, pre&s;t him to &s;peak to the Marquis his Father in the Chevalier's Favour.</P>
<P>The young Marquis was charmed with this friendly Solicitude in the Count of <HI>Berci;</HI> he did not fail to give it Prai&s;es which called up a Blu&s;h in the Face of the ingenuous Youth, who was con&s;cious of another and &s;tronger Motive for that Conduct. It was agreed between them, that, while the Mar|quis went to talk to his Father on this Subject, the Count &s;hould go to the Mar|quis <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> and urge the fame Argu|ments, in order to induce him to ha&s;ten a
<PB N="124" REF="125">
Marriage between two Per&s;ons who had &s;uffered &s;o much for each other.</P>
<P>The two good old Men received the Pro|po&s;al with great Satisfaction: to the E&s;teem the old Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> had for the Chevalier, nothing could be added; nor to the Admiration of the Marquis <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> for the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci.</HI> Little did they imagine that the Marriage they &s;o readily agreed to, would meet with Ob&s;tacles from the two Per&s;ons, whom they believed wi&s;hed for it with mo&s;t ardour.</P>
<P>The Marquis <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> was no &s;ooner a&s;&s;ured of the A&s;&s;ent of the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> but he ha&s;tened to commu|nicate the good News to his Nephew, whom he expected to &s;ee in Tran&s;ports at his Feet: but what was his A&s;toni&s;hment when he heard him coldly an&s;wer, that the Unea&s;ine&s;s he had felt, on account of the Calumnies his Character had &s;o long laboured under, and the Dangers he had &s;o lately &s;uffered at Sea, had given his Thoughts another Turn, and he had made a Vow to remain &s;ingle for &s;ome Years.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> al&s;o, when her Father mentioned his De&s;ign of be&s;towing her upon the Chevalier, told him with a well per&s;onated Tranquility, that during her Re&s;idence in the Convent at <HI>E&s;tampes</HI> &s;he had Lei&s;ure to contemplate the calm Plea|&s;ures
<PB N="125" REF="126">
of a reclu&s;e Life, and was per&s;uaded that it was greatly to be preferred to the mo&s;t &s;plended Condition the World could afford her; that therefore &s;he had re&s;olved to quit it and retire to that Mona&s;tery as &s;oon as her Proce&s;s was ended.</P>
<P>The good old Men were a&s;toni&s;hed and confu&s;ed at An&s;wers they &s;o little expected, and their Perplexity was &s;o much the greater as they dur&s;t not acquaint one another with what had happened, le&s;t they &s;hould make a Breach which would be impo&s;&s;ible ever again to clo&s;e.</P>
<P>Not being able to comprehend the Mean|ing of &s;o &s;udden and &s;urprizing an Altera|tion in their Sentiments, they could not &s;uppre&s;s their Anger at what appeared to them to be the mere Effect of Di&s;obe|dience and Caprice.</P>
<P><Q>What! (&s;aid the Marquis <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> to the Chevalier) when I would have married you to Madam <HI>de Gevincourt,</HI> an Alliance upon which I had &s;et my Heart, becau&s;e it was &s;o greatly to your Ad|vantage, you excu&s;ed your&s;elf on account of the Journey you was indi&s;pen&s;ibly obliged to make to Court, while your true Rea&s;on was that you was engaged to the Coun|te&s;s of <HI>Berci:</HI> and now when convinced of her great Merit, I propo&s;e to unite you with her, you talk to me of Vows,
<PB N="126" REF="127">
and pious Reveries. Do as you plea&s;e; but remember that if you per&s;i&s;t in &s;uch an unrea&s;onable and ab&s;urd Behaviour, you will force me to place that Affec|tion I have had for you, on &s;ome other Per&s;on who will make a better U&s;e of it.</Q></P>
<P>The Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> as he had mo&s;t Cau&s;e, was &s;till more enraged with the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci.</HI>
<Q>By what unac|countable Caprice are you governed? (&s;aid he to her) you have &s;uffered the Cheva|lier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> to conduct you into fo|reign Countries, and lived for &s;everal Months under his Protection, you left my Hou&s;e &s;ecretly to go in Search of him, you have di&s;gui&s;ed your Sex, for|got your Rank, and laid a&s;ide your Cha|racter, appearing in Arms to defend his Cau&s;e at a Time when you thought your &s;elf for&s;aken by him: And now when his Fidelity to you is fully proved by his Rejection of a lovely and generous Maid to who&s;e Affection he is &s;o greatly obliged, when your Father offers him to your Ac|ceptance, you refu&s;e his Hand. But go to <HI>E&s;tampes,</HI> &s;hut your&s;elf up in a Con|vent if real Piety leads you thither: go and be happy. But tru&s;t my Experience this Re&s;olution is not the Effect of Piety, or calm Reflections on the Peace and Tranquility of a cloi&s;tered Life. That Caprice by which your Actions have been
<PB N="127" REF="128">
lately governed, &s;ways you now. Go then and repent, for that will be the Con|&s;equence of a De&s;ign not taken up upon mature Deliberation, but the Re&s;ult of a heated Imagination, and a Judgment weak|ened by Pa&s;&s;ion and Prejudice. Whatever happens you may be &s;ure of my Pity, al|though your ridiculous and di&s;obedient Conduct gives you no Claim to my Af|fection.</Q></P>
<P>The Marquis had no &s;ooner quitted the Counte&s;s, which he did at the Conclu&s;ion of this Speech, than &s;he began to repent of the Unea&s;ine&s;s &s;he had given her Father, and ardently wi&s;hed, &s;he had not treated her Lover with &s;uch Cruelty and Contempt. For &s;he now &s;aw Things in another Light, and condemned her&s;elf for judging &s;o ra&s;hly of his Appearance with the fair Amazon, &s;ince it was certain that &s;he loved him, and that he might have married her, if his Heart had been capable of Change. Her Pride would not &s;uffer her to make the fir&s;t Advance to|wards a Reconciliation, which &s;he now eagerly wi&s;hed for: but &s;till &s;he expected the Chevalier &s;hould purcha&s;e it by new Sub|mi&s;&s;ions on his Part. Little did &s;he imagine that that Heart, in which &s;he had once &s;uch ab&s;olute Dominion, was now wholly en|gro&s;t by two Pa&s;&s;ions, that were mortal Foes to Love. Rage at the cruel Affront &s;he had given him in the Pre&s;ence of the whole Court, turned all his Thoughts towards
<PB N="128" REF="129">
Revenge, which he was re&s;olved to gratify, tho' at the Expence of his eternal Quiet.</P>
<P>In this Di&s;po&s;ition of Mind, he wrote a Letter to his ungrateful Mi&s;tre&s;s, which he gave to his Valet de Chambre with Orders to deliver it into her own Hand. He then privately left <HI>Paris</HI> in the Evening, taking his Cour&s;e along the <HI>Seine,</HI> full of unea&s;y Thoughts, and uncertain how he &s;hould di&s;po&s;e of him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, the Marchione&s;s <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> and her Daughter-in-law, that dear and tender Friend of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> having been informed by the Mar|qui&s;s her Father, of her Refu&s;al to marry the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> and her new Re&s;olu|tion of retiring to a Convent, were inex|pre&s;&s;ibly concerned: they went both toge|ther to her Apartment, where the Counte&s;s, vanqui&s;hed by their Importunity, and her own Inclinations, promi&s;ed to give her Fa|ther that Proof of her Obedience which he required, and acknowledged her unchanged Love for the Chevalier.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Ladies were highly plea&s;ed that they had &s;ucceeded &s;o happily with the Counte&s;s, whom in their Hearts they could not but think extremely capricious, and were impatient to communicate the good News to the Chevalier: but while the young Marchione&s;s was writing a Letter to that
<PB N="129" REF="130">
Effect, the Chevalier's Valet de Chambre brought one to the Counte&s;s which was conceived in the&s;e Terms:</P>
<P><Q>After the Proofs you have given me, Madam, of the Levity of your Temper, and the Incon&s;tancy of your Heart, I can with Difficulty believe, you are the &s;ame Per&s;on whom for many Years I have &s;o religiou&s;ly adored. Blind and infatuated as I was, I would once have preferred the &s;weet Slavery, to which you had reduced me, to the mo&s;t &s;plendid Rank For|tune could have be&s;towed upon me. But the Illu&s;ion is vani&s;hed, the unde&s;erved Contempt you have treated me with has opened my Eyes, and re&s;tored me to my|&s;elf. I have loved you, Madam, with a Pa&s;&s;ion which no Time could weaken, no Accidents alter. It is one Part of my Happine&s;s now, that I can &s;ay, I have loved you: and another, tho' le&s;s con&s;i|derable, that injured as I am by you, yet I have been &s;o fortunate as to render you Services which no other Man ever can, and could only be paid by your Affection, to which I now no longer lay claim. Bani&s;h them from your Thoughts, Ma|dam, as well as my Per&s;on; for this is the la&s;t Time I &s;hall ever endeavour to bring either them, or my&s;elf, to your Remem|brance. I leave you free to make new Conque&s;ts, and to triumph in new Acts
<PB N="130" REF="131">
of Incon&s;tancy: and, contented with hav|ing recovered my Liberty, can with per|fect Indifference bid you eternally Fare|well.</Q></P>
<P>The Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> pierced to the Heart with the Reproaches contained in this Letter, but more at the cruel Indifference of the Writer, apparent in every Line, had &s;carce Strength enough to read it through. The Words, 'I bid you an eternal Adieu,' &s;eemed to have Power to &s;eparate her Soul from her Body; and lo&s;ing Sen&s;e and Mo|tion, &s;he fell lifele&s;s on the Sopha, where &s;he was &s;itting when &s;he received the fatal Billet.</P>
<P>Madam <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> entering her Daughter's Apartment, and &s;eeing her in that Condition, &s;hrieked aloud, and was very near &s;inking likewi&s;e into a Swoon. The young Marchione&s;s was one of the fir&s;t who ran to the Counte&s;s's Apartment: terrified at the melancholy Objects &s;he &s;aw before her, with one Arm &s;he &s;upported the faint|ing Mother while, with the other &s;he en|deavoured to rai&s;e the Counte&s;s. Two or three Women entering, they applied proper Remedies to both. The Counte&s;s opened her Eyes with a Sigh, and as &s;oon as &s;he was a little recovered, de&s;ired &s;he might be left alone with her Mother and Si&s;ter-in-law, to whom &s;he &s;hewed the Chevalier's
<PB N="131" REF="132">
cruel Letter; and while they were reading it, ea&s;ed her loaded Heart by a Shower of Tears.</P>
<P>The two Marchione&s;&s;es, not knowing the Cau&s;e which the Counte&s;s had given for &s;uch a Letter, were equally &s;urpri&s;ed and angry at it. Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> was not in|genuous enough to tell them what had hap|pened: but took a gloomy Plea&s;ure in hear|ing him condemned by tho&s;e two Ladies for a Conduct &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with the Pa&s;&s;ion he had confe&s;t for her, and with that Po|litene&s;s and Di&s;cretion which made up &s;o con&s;iderable a Part of his Character. But tortured with her own Reflexions, and de&s;|pairing of ever being able to recover the Heart of a Man who had quitted her with &s;uch a &s;eeming calm and &s;teady Re&s;ent|ment, &s;he &s;unk under the violent Perturba|tions of her Mind, and was &s;eized with a Fever, which in a few Days brought her &s;o low that her Life was de&s;paired of. Her Youth, however, and a naturally good Con|&s;titution, &s;aved her: but &s;he continued in a weak and langui&s;hing Condition for three whole Months, and plunged in &s;o deep a Melancholy as filled the Hearts of her Pa|rents, and all to whom &s;he was dear, with inexpre&s;&s;ible Di&s;quiet.</P>
<P>But to return to the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars.</HI> After he had &s;ent the Letter to the Coun|te&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> he left his Hotel pre&s;ently,
<PB N="132" REF="133">
and pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Seine,</HI> went to <HI>S. Glou,</HI> where he lay that Night: early in the Morning he renewed his Journey, and leaving the Village of <HI>S. Clou</HI> on his left Hand, he &s;truck into the road on the right Hand of <HI>Surene,</HI> near which was a Mountain long celebrated for having afforded a Retreat to &s;everal illu&s;trious Per&s;ons. The Chevalier reached the Summit of this Mountain ju&s;t as the Sun was beginning to gild the Earth with his Rays. He &s;topped a few Moments to take Breath, and to contemplate the mo&s;t beautiful rural Pro&s;pect in the World, which was varied by a va&s;t Number of fine Vil|lages, and &s;uperb Palaces: but the lovelie&s;t Object of all was that renowned River, which, after pa&s;&s;ing through the Middle of that Queen of Cities to which it continually carries Riches and Plenty, &s;eems to leave her with Regret, and &s;lowly gliding through this rich Country, forms a thou&s;and and a thou&s;and imperceptible windings in its meandring Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The Chevalier felt a &s;ecret Satisfaction &s;teal to his Heart at the View of this in|chanting Place; the new and plea&s;ing Ob|jects around him, the &s;oft Melody of the Birds, the gentle Breathings of the Wind that wafted Odours as it pa&s;t, the plea&s;ing Stillne&s;s, all contributed to charm his Sen&s;es, and lull him into a &s;weet Oblivion of former Griefs. Tran&s;ported at the &s;udden Change he felt in his Mind, and fondly
<PB N="133" REF="134">
hoping, that the Calm he now experienced would be &s;ecured by fixing his Re&s;idence in this delightful Spot, he took a Re&s;olution to return no more to <HI>Paris,</HI> but to hide him&s;elf from the World, and pa&s;s the re&s;t of his Life in a peaceful Retirement, alike undi&s;turbed by the Pangs of Love, and the Fever of Ambition.</P>
<P>The Solitaries, who inhabited Mount <HI>Va|lerian,</HI> received their new Inmate with Joy; his Air and Mien &s;poke him a Per&s;on of Di&s;tinction; his Conver&s;ation and Beha|viour a Man of Sen&s;e and Politene&s;s. The Cell he cho&s;e had a little Gallery clo&s;e to the Chapel where he could hear Ma&s;s with|out being &s;een: he had a &s;mall Garden ad|joining to his Cell, which he took delight to cultivate with his own Hands. Several Hours in the Day he pa&s;t in the Conver&s;a|tion of tho&s;e Religious who to the greate&s;t Sanctity joined the mo&s;t plea&s;ing Manners, and an uninterupted Chearfulne&s;s with the &s;tricte&s;t Piety.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e reverend Per&s;ons the Che|valier di&s;tingui&s;hed one to whom a &s;ecret Sympathy particularly attached him. He was already pa&s;t the Prime of Life, but &s;eemed more impaired by Affliction than by Years; his Per&s;on had an Air of Dignity which at fir&s;t &s;ight, commanded Re&s;pect. There was a certain Grace in every Thing he &s;aid, and did, which in&s;en&s;ibly capti|vated
<PB N="134" REF="135">
the Heart: his Countenance expre&s;|&s;ed a fixed Melancholy, through which, not|with&s;tanding, &s;hone a Benignity and Sweet|ne&s;s, that made every Beholder &s;ympathi&s;e in his Sadne&s;s, but with &s;uch a &s;weet Sen|&s;ation as a good Heart feels when it con|templates a Misfortune it wi&s;hes and thinks it&s;elf able to relieve.</P>
<P>It was ea&s;y to perceive that he had been extremely hand&s;ome in his Youth. His uncouth Habit could not wholly con|ceal the Graces of his Figure, nor could Time and Grief produce any Alteration in the Harmony of his Features. The Chevalier eagerly &s;ought his Company and Conver&s;ation, and the Solitary found &s;o many Charms in that of the Chevalier, that he &s;pent all tho&s;e Hours which he had to &s;pare from his religious Duties with him. To a mutual Friend&s;hip a mutual Confidence &s;uc|ceeded, the Chevalier di&s;clo&s;ed his Name and his Misfortunes to the Solitary, who likewi&s;e related to him the Hi&s;tory of his Life in the following Manner.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The Hi&s;tory</HI> OF THE Count DE COMMINGE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Hou&s;e of <HI>Comminge,</HI> from which I am de&s;cended, is one of the mo&s;t ancient and illu&s;trious in the Kingdom. My Great Grand-Father, who had two Sons, was &s;o extremely fond of the Younge&s;t, that he &s;ettled &s;ome very con&s;iderable E&s;tates upon him, in prejudice to the Right of his el|der Brother, and gave him the Title of Marquis of <HI>Lu&s;&s;an.</HI> The Partiality of my Ance&s;tor did not weaken the Friend&s;hip be|tween his two Sons, which increa&s;ed with their Years. They would have their Chil|dren brought up together, but by giving them thus their Education in common, in&s;tead of uniting them by &s;tricter Ties than tho&s;e of Blood, which was their &s;ole View in it, they rendered them Enemies almo&s;t from their Birth.</P>
<P>My Father who was always excelled in his Exerci&s;es by the young Marquis of <HI>Lu&s;|&s;an,</HI> conceived a Jealou&s;y at it, which &s;oon degenerated into a fixed Aver&s;ion. They often quarelled, and my Father being al|ways the Aggre&s;&s;or, it was he who was al|ways puni&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="137">One Day when he complained of this Treatment to the Steward of our Family,
<Q>Know, (&s;aid this Man to him) that you will have it in your Power to repre&s;s the Pride of the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Lu&s;&s;an,</HI> all the E&s;tates he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es are entrailed upon you and your Grand-Father could not di&s;po&s;e of them: when you are the Ma|&s;ter (added he) it will not be difficult for you to recover your Right.</Q></P>
<P>This Intimation convincing my Father that he had it in his Power to be revenged of his Cou&s;in, made him &s;et no Bounds to his Re&s;entment. Their Quarrels became &s;o frequent and &s;o violent, that there was a Nece&s;&s;ity for &s;eparating them. They were many Years without &s;eeing each other, during which they were both married. The Marquis of <HI>Lu&s;&s;an</HI> had only a Daughter by his Wife, and my Father only a Son by his, which was my-&s;elf.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as my Father came to the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of his hereditary E&s;tate by the Death of his Grand-father, he determined to fol|low the Advice that had been given him, while he was yet a Youth, and which he had never lo&s;t Sight of: he omitted nothing that could render his Claim unque&s;tionable, and rejecting &s;everal Propo&s;als for an Ac|commodation, commenced a Law-&s;uit with the Marquis of <HI>Lu&s;&s;an,</HI> which could not
<PB N="137" REF="138">
but terminate in the de&s;poiling him of all his E&s;tates.</P>
<P>An unhappy Rencounter which they had one Day in a hunting Match rendered them for ever irreconcilable. My Father, who&s;e vowed Revenge was never out of his Thoughts, &s;aid &s;everal cruel Things to the Marquis of <HI>Lu&s;&s;an</HI> upon the de&s;picable State to which he expected &s;oon to reduce him. The Marquis, tho' naturally mild, could not help an&s;wering him with &s;ome Haugh|tine&s;s. They had Recour&s;e to their Swords: Fortune declared in favour of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Lu&s;&s;an:</HI> he di&s;armed my Father, and bid him a&s;k his Life.</P>
<P><Q>I &s;hould hate it (an&s;wered my Father fiercely) if I owed it to thee.</Q>
<Q>Yet, Spite of thy &s;elf thou &s;halt owe it to me, (&s;aid the Marquis <HI>de Lu&s;&s;an</HI> throwing him his Sword) after which he in&s;tantly left him.</Q></P>
<P>This generous Action did not move my Father in his Favour, on the contrary the double Victory his Enemy had gained over him, increa&s;ed his Hatred; and he carried on the Suit again&s;t the Marquis <HI>de Lu&s;&s;an</HI> more vigorou&s;ly than before. However when his Hopes were highe&s;t, he received &s;ome Accounts from his Lawyers, which effectually da&s;hed them. This Di&s;appoint|ment threw him into &s;uch Tran&s;ports of
<PB N="138" REF="139">
Rage and Grief as brought on a dangerous Fever, under which he langui&s;hed a long Time; and in this State I found him at my Return from my Travels upon which I had been &s;ent immediately after my Stu|dies were fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>A few Days after my Arrival, the Abbot <HI>de R</HI> . . . . a Kin&s;man of my Mother's, &s;ent Notice to my Father, that the Writ|ings, which alone were able to prove his ju&s;t Claim to the E&s;tates po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Marquis <HI>de Lu&s;&s;an,</HI> were in the Archives of the Abbey of <HI>R</HI> . . . . to which Place many of the Papers belonging to our Family had been carried during the civil Wars.</P>
<P>My Father was de&s;ired by the Abbot <HI>de R</HI> . . . . to keep this Information &s;ecret and to come him&s;elf for tho&s;e Writings, or &s;end a Per&s;on for them, on who&s;e Fi|delity he could have an ab&s;olute Depen|dance.</P>
<P>The bad State of his Health not permit|ing him to go him&s;elf, he charged me with this Commi&s;&s;ion after many times repre|&s;enting to me the great Importance of it.</P>
<P><Q>You (&s;aid he to me) are more concerned in the Recovery of the&s;e Papers than I am. The E&s;tates will probably &s;oon be yours: but if you had no intere&s;t in them, I think well enough of you to believe
<PB N="139" REF="140">
that you &s;hare my Re&s;entment, and are eager to revenge the Injuries I have re|ceived.</Q></P>
<P>After giving me &s;ome other nece&s;&s;ary In|&s;tructions, it was re&s;olved that I &s;hould take the Title of Marquis <HI>de Longaunois,</HI> that my Bu&s;ine&s;s in the Abbey might not be &s;u&s;pected, Madam <HI>de Lu&s;&s;an</HI> having &s;e|veral Relations there.</P>
<P>I &s;et out accompanied only by an old Ser|vant of my Father's, and my own Valet de Chambre: my Journey proved &s;ucce&s;s|ful: I found in the Archives of the Abbey of <HI>R</HI> . . . . the Writings which proved in|conte&s;tably the Entail.</P>
<P>I wrote to my Father, and gave him an Account of all that I had done: and as I was only at a &s;mall Di&s;tance from <HI>Bag|nieres,</HI> I de&s;ired he would permit me to &s;tay there during the Sea&s;on for drinking the Waters. My Father was &s;o plea&s;ed with the Succe&s;s of my Journey, that he readily complied with my Reque&s;t.</P>
<P>I &s;till appeared under the borrowed Title of the Marquis <HI>de Longaunois.</HI> I had too incon&s;iderable an Equipage to &s;upport the Grandeur of that of <HI>Comminge.</HI> The Day after my Arrival I went to the Fountain: in the&s;e Places Ceremony is laid a&s;ide, and an ea&s;y polite Freedom better &s;upplies its Place.
<PB N="140" REF="141">
From the fir&s;t Day of my Appearance at the Baths, I was admitted into all Parties of Plea&s;ure, and introduced at the Hou&s;e of the Marquis <HI>de la Vallete,</HI> who that Day gave a grand Entertainment to the Ladies.</P>
<P>I found &s;ome of them already come whom I had &s;een at the Fountain, and &s;aid &s;ome tender Things to them as I then thought my &s;elf obliged to do to all Women. I was engaged in a particular Conver&s;ation with one of them, when a Lady of good Pre&s;ence entered the Room, followed by a Girl of &s;urpri&s;ing Beauty: her Charms fixed my Attention immediately, her graceful Mo|de&s;ty won my E&s;teem, I loved her from that Moment, and that Moment decided the De&s;tiny of my whole Life: in&s;en&s;ibly my former Gaiety vani&s;hed, I could do no|thing but gaze on her, and follow her every where: &s;he perceived it, and blu&s;hed. A Walk was propo&s;ed, and I had the good Fortune to lead her. We were at a &s;uf|ficient Di&s;tance from the re&s;t of the Com|pany to give me an Opportunity of talking to her upon a Subject by which my whole Thoughts were engro&s;&s;ed: but I who a few Moments before was not able to remove my Eyes from her Face, had now when we were alone not Courage enough to look upon her. Till then I had always talked of Love to Women for whom I felt no|thing but Indifference: but as &s;oon as my
<PB N="141" REF="142">
Heart was really &s;ubdued, I found it im|po&s;&s;ible to &s;peak.</P>
<P>We rejoined the Company without hav|ing uttered a &s;ingle Word to each other. The Ladies were conducted to their Lodg|ings, and I returned home, where I &s;hut my &s;elf up in my Apartment. In the Di&s;|po&s;ition my Mind was then in, Solitude was mo&s;t agreeable. I felt a certain Kind of Joy mixed with Pain, which I believe al|ways accompanies a beginning Pa&s;&s;ion: mine had rendered me &s;o timid, that I dur&s;t not endeavour to know the Name of her I loved. I was apprehen&s;ive, my Curio|&s;ity would betray the Secret of my Heart&punc; but how did it &s;ink within me when I learned that it was the Daughter of the Marquis of <HI>Lu&s;&s;an,</HI> who had charmed me. All the Ob&s;tacles, that oppo&s;ed my Hap|pine&s;s, ro&s;e in&s;tantly to my Mind. But the Fear, that <HI>Adelaida</HI> (&s;o was that lovely Girl called) had been early taught to hate my Name, was what mo&s;t alarmed me. I thought my&s;elf fortunate in having a&s;&s;umed another, and fondly hoped that &s;he would know my Pa&s;&s;ion for her, before &s;he could be prejudiced again&s;t me, and that when &s;he knew who I was, &s;he would at lea&s;t be induced to pity me.</P>
<P>I therefore determined to conceal my true Name as long as po&s;&s;ible, and in the mean Time to u&s;e every Method to plea&s;e her:
<PB N="142" REF="143">
but I was too much in Love to employ any other than that of loving. I followed her wherever &s;he went, I ardently wi&s;hed for an Opportunity of &s;peaking to her in pri|vate; and when that &s;o much de&s;ired Op|portunity offered it&s;elf, I had not Power to take Advantage of it. The Fear of for|feiting a thou&s;and little Freedoms, which I now enjoyed, re&s;trained me: but my greate&s;t Fear was that of offending her.</P>
<P>This was my Situation when one Even|ing, as the Company was walking in little &s;eparate Parties, <HI>Adelaida</HI> dropt a Bracelet off her Arm to which her Picture was fa&s;tened. The Chevalier <HI>de Saint Oden,</HI> who led her, eagerly &s;tooped to take it up, and after gazing on it a Moment put it into his Pocket. <HI>Adelaida</HI> at fir&s;t a&s;ked for it mildly; but he ob&s;tinately refu&s;ing to return it, &s;he expre&s;|&s;ed great re&s;entment at a behaviour which argued &s;o little Re&s;pect for her. The Che|valier was hand&s;ome, &s;ome little Succe&s;&s;es with the Fair, had made him vain and pre|&s;uming. Without being di&s;concerted at <HI>Ade|laida's</HI> Anger.</P>
<P><Q>Why, Mademoi&s;elle, (&s;aid he) would you deprive me of a Good which I owe only to chance? I flatter my&s;elf (con|tinued he lowering his Voice) that when you know the Sentiments you have in|&s;pired me with, you will &s;uffer me to keep what that has pre&s;ented me.</Q>
Say|ing
<PB N="143" REF="144">
this he bowed profoundly low, and, without waiting for her An&s;wer, retired.</P>
<P>I happened not to be with her then. The Marchione&s;s <HI>de la Valette</HI> and I were talk|ing at a little di&s;tance: but although I quit|ted her as &s;eldom as po&s;&s;ible, yet my At|tention was always fixed upon her. I never lo&s;t a Look, a Word, or Action of her's, and however particularly engaged, I never failed in any of tho&s;e A&s;&s;iduities, which others practi&s;e to plea&s;e, but which the Exce&s;s of my pa&s;&s;ion made me find incon|ceivable Plea&s;ure in performing.</P>
<P>Hearing her &s;peak with unu&s;ual Emotion, I approached her, &s;he was giving her Mo|ther an Account of what had happened. Madam <HI>de Lu&s;&s;an</HI> was as much offended at the Chevalier's Behaviour as her Daugh|ter. I was &s;ilent, I even continued my Walk with the Ladies. When they retired I &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to the Chevalier, he was at home, and in Con&s;equence of my de&s;ir|ing him to meet me, he came in&s;tantly to the Place appointed.</P>
<P><Q>I cannot per&s;uade my&s;elf (&s;aid I ap|proaching him) that what has happened during our Walk to Day, is more than a meer Plea&s;antry: you are too gallant and well bred to keep a Lady's Picture con|trary to her Inclination.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="145">
<Q>I know not (an&s;wered he warmly) what Intere&s;t you take in my keeping or re|&s;toring it. But I know that I neither need, nor will accept of your Advice. Then (replied I claping my Hand on my Sword) I will force you to receive it in this Manner.</Q></P>
<P>The Chevalier was brave, he eagerly an&s;wered my Defiance, we fought for &s;ome time with equal Succe&s;s: but he was not animated like me with the De&s;ire of &s;erving what I loved. He wounded me &s;lightly in two Places: but I gave him two large Wounds, and obliged him both to a&s;k his Life, and to re&s;ign the Picture. After I had a&s;&s;i&s;ted him to ri&s;e and had conducted him to the neare&s;t Hou&s;e, I retired to my own Lodgings, where as &s;oon as the Wounds I had received were dre&s;t, I &s;et my|&s;elf to contemplate that lovely Picture, and ki&s;&s;ed it a thou&s;and, and a thou&s;and times.</P>
<P>I had a Genius for Painting which I had taken &s;ome Pains to cultivate: yet I was far from being a Ma&s;ter in the Art. But what will not Love accompli&s;h? I undertook to copy this Portrait. I &s;pent two Days in this Employment. Delightful ta&s;k! I &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that even a very di&s;cern|ing Eye might have mi&s;taken mine for the Original. This in&s;pired me with the Thought of &s;ub&s;tituting one for the other, by which
<PB N="145" REF="146">
contrivance I &s;hould have the Advantage of keeping that which had belonged to <HI>Adelaida,</HI> and &s;he without knowing it, would always bear my Work about her.</P>
<P>The&s;e trifles to one who truly loves, are matters of great Importance, and my Heart knew how to &s;et the full Value on them.</P>
<P>After I had fa&s;tened the Picture I had painted to the Ribbon in &s;uch a Manner that my cheat could not be di&s;covered, I pre|&s;ented it to <HI>Adelaida.</HI> Madam <HI>de Lu&s;&s;an</HI> expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf highly obliged to me. <HI>A|delaida</HI> &s;aid little, &s;he &s;eemed embarra&s;&s;ed, but in the Mid&s;t of that Embarra&s;ment I thought I di&s;covered that &s;he was plea&s;ed at having received this little Obligation from me, and that Thought gave me a real Tran&s;port.</P>
<P>I have in my Life experienced &s;ome of tho&s;e happy Moments, and had my Misfor|tunes been only common ones, I &s;hould not have believed them too dearly purcha&s;ed.</P>
<P>After this little Adventure I &s;tood ex|tremely well in the E&s;teem of Madam <HI>de Lu&s;&s;an.</HI> I was always at her Lodgings, I &s;aw <HI>Adelaida</HI> every Hour in the Day, and although I did not &s;peak to her of my Pa&s;|&s;ion, yet I was &s;ure &s;he knew it: and I had Rea&s;on to believe &s;he did not hate me. Hearts as &s;en&s;ible as ours were, quickly un|der&s;tand
<PB N="146" REF="147">
each other: to them every Thing is Expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I had lived two Months in this Man|ner, when I received a Letter from my Fa|ther, in which he commanded me to re|turn immediately. This Command was to me like the &s;troke of a Thunder-bolt: my whole Soul had been engro&s;t with the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing, and loving <HI>Adelaida.</HI> The Idea of leaving her was wholly new to me. The Horror of parting from her, the con&s;equences of the Law-&s;uit between our Families ro&s;e to my Thoughts with every Aggravation to di&s;tract me. I pa&s;&s;ed the Night in the utmo&s;t Agitation, and after having formed a thou&s;and different Pro&s;|pects, all equally fruitle&s;s and impracticable, it came &s;uddenly into my Mind to burn the Writings which were &s;till in my Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, tho&s;e now hated Writings that proved our Claim to the E&s;tates of the Family of <HI>Lu&s;&s;an.</HI> I was a&s;toni&s;hed that I had not hit upon this Expedient &s;ooner, &s;ince it was the mo&s;t effectual Method I could take to put an End to a Suit the Con&s;equences of which I had &s;o much dreaded. It was not impo&s;&s;ible but my Father, who had proceeded very far, might be induced to terminate the Affair amicably by my Marriage with <HI>Adelaida:</HI> but altho' there &s;hould be no Foundation for &s;o plea&s;|ing a Hope, yet I could not con&s;ent to fur|ni&s;h Arms again&s;t what I loved. I reproached my&s;elf for having &s;o long kept Papers in my
<PB N="147" REF="148">
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which ought to have been &s;ooner &s;acrificed to my Tenderne&s;s. The Reflec|tion of the Injury I did my Father could not &s;top me a Moment from the Execution of this De&s;ign. His e&s;tates were entailed upon me, and I inherited one left me by my Mother's Brother which I could re&s;ign to him to pro|cure his Pardon, and which was much more con&s;iderable than that I was the Cau&s;e of his lo&s;ing.</P>
<P>There needed no more Arguments to convince a Man in Love, and already de|termined. I went in&s;tantly to my Clo&s;et for the little Box which contained tho&s;e Papers. Never had I in my whole Life experienced &s;o happy a Moment, as that in which I committed them to the Flames. I was tran&s;ported into Rapture at the Thoughts of &s;o effectually &s;erving the Ob|ject of my Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><Q>If &s;he loves me (&s;aid I) &s;he &s;hall one Day know the Sacrifice I have made for her: but if I am not &s;o happy as to touch her Heart, &s;he &s;hall always remain in Ignorance of it. Why &s;hould I make her &s;en&s;ible of an Obligation &s;he would be &s;orry to own to me? I would have <HI>Ade|laida</HI> love me, but I would not have her think her&s;elf indebted to me.</Q></P>
<P>I confe&s;s however, that after this Action, I found my&s;elf emboldened to declare my Sen|timents
<PB N="148" REF="149">
to her, and the Freedom, with which I vi&s;ited at her Mother's, gave me an Opportunity that very Day.</P>
<P><Q>I am going to leave you, charming <HI>Adelaida,</HI> (&s;aid I) will you have the Good|ne&s;s to think &s;ometimes of a Man, who&s;e Happine&s;s, or who&s;e Mi&s;ery you only can make?</Q>
I had not power to go on, &s;he &s;eemed alarmed, confu&s;ed, I thought al&s;o that I &s;aw Grief in her Eyes.</P>
<P><Q>You have heard me (re&s;umed I trem|bling) give me &s;ome An&s;wer, I implore it of your Compa&s;&s;ion, &s;peak one Word to me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>What would you have me &s;ay to you? (replied &s;he with vi&s;ible Emotion) I ought not to have heard you, and I ought le&s;s to an&s;wer you.</Q></P>
<P>Scarce did &s;he give her&s;elf Time to pro|nounce the&s;e few Words, &s;he left me &s;o &s;uddenly. I &s;taid the re&s;t of the Day there, but I found it impo&s;&s;ible again to &s;peak to her alone. She avoided me carefully. She had an Air of Perplexity and Confu&s;ion: how lovely did &s;he appear to me with that perplexed Air, and that &s;weet innocent Confu&s;ion: my Re&s;pect for her was equal to my Love, I could not look on her with|out trembling. I dreaded le&s;t my Pre&s;ump|tion
<PB N="149" REF="150">
had made her repent of her Goodne&s;s towards me.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have longer ob&s;erved a Conduct &s;o conformable to my Re&s;pect for her, and to the Delicacy of my own Sentiments, if the Nece&s;&s;ity I was under of leaving her, had not forced me to &s;peak: I was willing to tell <HI>Adelaida</HI> my true Name before I went away: but I dreaded this Declaration even more than my former.</P>
<P><Q>I perceive you avoid me, Madam. (&s;aid I to her) Alas! what will you do when you know all my Crimes, or rather my Misfortunes? I have impo&s;ed upon you by a fal&s;e Name: I am not the Per&s;on you think me: I am (pur&s;ued I trembling with the violence of my Apprehen&s;ions) I am the Son of the Count <HI>de Comminge.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>The Son of the Count <HI>de Comminge,</HI> (cried <HI>Adelaida</HI> with A&s;toni&s;hment and Grief in her Face) our Enemy, our Per|&s;ecutor. Do not you and your Father urge the Ruin of mine?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Oh! do not wound me with &s;o cruel a Thought, (interrupted I, Tears in &s;pite of my&s;elf &s;treaming from my Eyes.) In me, charming <HI>Adelaida,</HI> you behold a Lo|ver ready to &s;acrifice all for you; my Father will never injure yours, my Love &s;ecures him in your Intere&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="151">
<Q>But, why, (replied <HI>Adelaida,</HI> recover|ing from her Surpri&s;e) why have you deceived me? Why did you conceal your true Name? Had I known it (pur&s;ued &s;he, &s;oftly &s;ighing) it would have warned me to fly from you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Oh! do not, Madam, (&s;aid I taking her Hand which I forcibly ki&s;&s;ed) do not repent of your Goodne&s;s towards me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Leave me, (&s;aid &s;he withdrawing her Hand) the more I &s;ee you, the more inevitable I render tho&s;e Misfortunes I too ju&s;tly apprehend.</Q></P>
<P>The latent Meaning of the&s;e Words fil|led me with a Tran&s;port that &s;uffered no|thing but Hope to appear. I flattered my|&s;elf that I &s;hould be able to render my Fa|ther favourable to my Pa&s;&s;ion. This Be|lief &s;o wholly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me, that I thought every one &s;hould think as I did. I &s;poke to <HI>Adelaida</HI> of my Projects like one who is &s;e|cure of Succe&s;s.</P>
<P><Q>I know not (&s;aid &s;he to me with a me|lancholy Air) why my Heart refu&s;es to yield to the Hopes you endeavour to in|&s;pire. I fore&s;ee nothing but Mi&s;ery in the cour&s;e of this Affair. Yet I find a Plea&s;ure in feeling what I do for you. I have not hid my Sentiments from you, I am wil|ling you &s;hould know them, but remember
<PB N="151" REF="152">
that if there is a nece&s;&s;ity for it, I am ca|pable of &s;acrificing them to my Duty.</Q></P>
<P>I had &s;everal Conver&s;ations with <HI>Adelaida</HI> before my Departure, and always found new Cau&s;e to congratulate my&s;elf upon my good Fortune. The Plea&s;ure of loving and knowing that I was beloved, filled my whole Heart; no Su&s;picion, no Fear for the future could di&s;turb the tender Softne&s;s of our Interviews. We were &s;ecure of each other's Affection, becau&s;e E&s;teem was the Ba&s;is of it, and this Certainty far from di|mini&s;hing the Ardour of our Pa&s;&s;ion, added to it all the Sweets of Hope, and all the Charms of Confidence.</P>
<P><Q>I &s;hould die with grief, (&s;aid &s;he to me) if I bring upon you the Di&s;plea&s;ure of your Father. I would have you love me, but, Oh! I would rather have you happy.</Q></P>
<P>I parted from her at length, full of the mo&s;t tender and mo&s;t ardent Pa&s;&s;ion that ever Man felt, and my whole Soul intent upon the De&s;ign of rendering my Father favourable to it.</P>
<P>In the mean Time he was informed of every Thing that had pa&s;&s;ed at the Baths. The Servant whom he had put about me, had &s;ecret Orders to ob&s;erve my Conduct. He had left him ignorant of nothing, neither
<PB N="152" REF="153">
of my Love, nor my Quarrel with the Che|valier <HI>de Saint Oden:</HI> unfortunately the Che|valier was the Son of one of my Father's mo&s;t intimate Friends; this Circum&s;tance, and the Danger to which he was reduced by his Wound, turned every Thing again&s;t me. The Servant, who had given him &s;uch exact Informations, repre&s;ented me to be much happier than I was. He de&s;cribed Madam and Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Lu&s;&s;an</HI> as full of Artifice and De&s;ign, as having always known me for the Count <HI>de Comminge,</HI> and had &s;pared no Pains to &s;educe me.</P>
<P>Thus prejudiced, my Father, naturally &s;e|vere and pa&s;&s;ionate, treated me at my Re|turn with great Har&s;hne&s;s, he reproached me with my Pa&s;&s;ion as a Crime of the blacke&s;t Dye.</P>
<P><Q>You have been ba&s;e enough (&s;aid he to me) to love my Enemies, and without reflecting what you owed either to me or your&s;elf, you have entered into engage|ments with tho&s;e I hate. And I know not (added he) whether you have not done &s;omething &s;till more worthy of my Re&s;entment!</Q></P>
<P><Q>Yes, Sir, (an&s;wered I throwing my|&s;elf at his Feet) I am guilty I confe&s;s, but I am &s;o in &s;pite of my&s;elf: at this very Moment when I implore your Par|don, I feel that no Power on Earth can

tear from my Heart that Pa&s;&s;ion which of|fends you, have Pity on me, and oh! &s;uffer me to &s;ay it, have Pity on your|&s;elf: put an End to the Hatred which di|&s;turbs the Tranquility of your Life. The Tenderne&s;s which the Daughter of Mon|&s;ieur <HI>de Lu&s;&s;an,</HI> and I felt for each other at fir&s;t &s;ight, &s;eems a Warning from Heaven to you. Alas! my dear Father, you have no other Child but me, would you make me mi&s;erable, and load me with Misfortunes &s;o much the more in|&s;upportable, as they will come from a Hand I mu&s;t ever love and revere? Suffer your&s;elf (my dear Father) to be &s;oftened into Forgivene&s;s of a Son who has of|fended you only by a Fatality for which he could not be an&s;werable.</Q></P>
<P>My Father, who had &s;uffered me to con|tinue kneeling during the whole time I was &s;peaking to him, looked on me for a Mo|ment with mingled Scorn and Indignation.</P>
<P>At length,
<Q>I have (&s;aid he) heard you with a Patience I am my&s;elf a&s;toni&s;hed at, and which I did not imagine I was capable of. I will &s;till pre&s;erve Compo&s;ure enough to tell you what is the only Fa|vour you are to expect from me.

<P>If my Father had &s;uffered him&s;elf to be moved by my Supplications, the Demand he made of the Papers would have greatly di&s;tre&s;t me: but his Har&s;hne&s;s gave me Courage.</P>
<P><Q>Tho&s;e Writings, (&s;aid I ri&s;ing) are no longer in my Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, I have burned them: but the E&s;tate I inherit of my Uncle's &s;hall be yours, in&s;tead of tho&s;e they would have given you.</Q></P>
<P>I had &s;carce Time to pronounce the&s;e few Words, my Father mad with Rage, drew his Sword, and would doubtle&s;s have run me through, for I made not the lea&s;t Effort to avoid him, if my Mother had not entered the Room that In&s;tant, and thrown her&s;elf half dead with Terror betwixt us.</P>
<P><Q>Ah! what would you do, (&s;aid &s;he ga&s;ping with the Violence of her Fears.) Is he not your Son?</Q>
Then forcing me out of the Room, &s;he ordered me to ex|pect her in her own Apartment.</P>
<P>I waited there a long Time before &s;he appeared: &s;he came at length: I had no longer Rage, Exclamation and Menaces to combat, but a tender Mother who en|tered into all my Griefs, and intreated me
<PB N="155" REF="156">
with Tears to have Compa&s;&s;ion on the Con|dition to which I had reduced her.</P>
<P><Q>What, my Son, (&s;aid &s;he to me) &s;hall a Mi&s;tre&s;s, and a Mi&s;tre&s;s whom you have known &s;o &s;hort a Time, be preferred to your Mother? Alas! if your Happi|ne&s;s depended upon me, I would &s;acri|fice every Thing to &s;ecure it; but you have a Father who will be obeyed. He is upon the Point of taking the mo&s;t vio|lent Re&s;olutions again&s;t you. Oh! my Son, if you would not make me mi&s;erable, &s;uppre&s;s a Pa&s;&s;ion that will render us all unhappy.</Q></P>
<P>I remained &s;ome Moments &s;ilent, how difficult was it to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch a Plea, &s;o ten|derly urged by a Mother, for whom I had the highe&s;t filial Affection: but Love was &s;till more powerful.</P>
<P><Q>I would die (&s;aid I) rather than di&s;|plea&s;e you. And I will die if you have not Pity on me. What can I do? It is ea&s;ier for me to take away my own Life than forget <HI>Adelaida.</HI> Shall I be perju|red and violate the Vows I have made to her? Vows which have engaged her early Affections. Shall I abandon her then when I know I have gained her Heart? Oh! my dear Mother, do not wi&s;h your Son to become the ba&s;e&s;t of Men.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="157">I then related to her all that had pa&s;t be|tween us.</P>
<P><Q>She loves you, (&s;aid I) and you, I am &s;ure will not be able to help loving her. She has your Sweetne&s;s, your Candor, your Genero&s;ity. How is it po&s;&s;ible for me to cea&s;e to love her?</Q></P>
<P><Q>But what do you propo&s;e by indulging this Pa&s;&s;ion? &s;aid my Mother: your Father is re&s;olved to have you marry another, and commands you to retire into the Country till every Thing is &s;ettled. It is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary that you &s;hould appear willing to obey him, unle&s;s you mean to be my Death. He expects you will de|part to morrow under the Conduct of a Per&s;on in whom he has great Confidence. Ab&s;ence will do more for you than you can yet imagine; but be that as it will, do not irritate Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Comminge</HI> &s;till more by your Refu&s;al: a&s;k for time, and I will do every Thing in my Power, to accompli&s;h your Wi&s;hes. Your Father's Anger cannot la&s;t always. He will re|lent and you may be yet happy, but you have been highly to blame in burning the Writings. He is per&s;uaded that you &s;a|crificed them to Madam <HI>de Lu&s;&s;an</HI> who or|dered her Daughter to require that Proof of your Love.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="158">
<Q>Oh! heavens! (cried I) is it po&s;&s;ible that my Father can be &s;o unju&s;t?

<P>My Mother and I afterwards took Mea|&s;ures to convey Letters to each other; and encouraged by her Indulgence, I dur&s;t pre|&s;ume to beg &s;he would tran&s;mit to me tho&s;e of <HI>Adelaida,</HI> who was &s;oon to be at <HI>Bourdeaux.</HI> My Mother had the Goodne&s;s to promi&s;e &s;he would gratify me, but at the &s;ame Time in&s;i&s;ted, that if I found <HI>Adelaida</HI> had altered her Sentiments, I &s;hould &s;ubmit to what my Father required of me. We &s;pent great Part of the Night in this Conver&s;ation, and as &s;oon as Day appeared my Conductor came to inform me that it was Time to get on Hor&s;e-back.</P>
<P>The E&s;tate, where I was to pa&s;s the Time of my Bani&s;hment, lay in the Moun|tains, &s;ome Leagues from <HI>Bagnieres,</HI> &s;o that we took the &s;ame Road I had &s;o lately pa&s;t through. The Second Day of our Journey we came early in the Evening to the Village where we were to lye. While Supper was preparing I went to take a Walk along the great Road, and at a Di&s;tance &s;aw an Equipage which drove very fa&s;t, and when it came within a few Paces
<PB N="158" REF="159">
of me overturned. My Heart by its throbbing acquainted me with the Part I had in this Accident; I eagerly flew towards the Coach, two Men on Hor&s;e-back who attend|ed it, alighted and joined me to a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e who were within: it will be ea&s;ily gue&s;&s;ed that tho&s;e Per&s;ons were <HI>Adelaida</HI> and her Mother. In Effect it was they. <HI>Adelaida</HI> was very much hurt in one of her Feet, but her Joy at &s;eeing me &s;eemed to leave her no Sen&s;e of her Pain.</P>
<P>What Plea&s;ure did I ta&s;te that happy Moment! after &s;o many Afflictions, and at the Di&s;tance of &s;o many Years, it is &s;till pre&s;ent to my Remembrance. <HI>Adelaida</HI> not being able to walk, I took her in my Arms to carry her to the Inn, her charming Arms were thrown round my Neck, and one of her Hands touched my Mouth. I was in a Tran&s;port that &s;carce &s;uffered me to breathe. <HI>Adelaida</HI> ob&s;erved it, her De|licacy was alarmed, &s;he made a Motion to di&s;&s;ingage her&s;elf from my Arms. Alas! how little did &s;he know the Exce&s;s of my Love, I was too much tran&s;ported with my pre&s;ent Happine&s;s to think there was any beyond it.</P>
<P><Q>Set me down, (&s;aid &s;he to me in a low and trembling Voice) I believe I am able to walk.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="160">
<Q>What (replied I) are you &s;o cruel as to envy me the only good Fortune I &s;hall perhaps ever enjoy.</Q>
I pre&s;t her tenderly to my Bo&s;om as I pronounced the&s;e Words. <HI>Adelaida</HI> was &s;ilent, and a fal&s;e Step which I made on Purpo&s;e, obliged her to re&s;ume her fir&s;t Attitude.</P>
<P>The Inn was at &s;o little Di&s;tance, that I was &s;oon forced to part with my beauteous Burden. I carried her into a Room and laid her on a Bed, while their Attendants did the &s;ame by her Mother who was much more hurt than <HI>Adelaida.</HI> Every one being bu&s;y about Madam <HI>de Lu&s;&s;an,</HI> I had time to acquaint <HI>Adelaida</HI> with part of what had pa&s;&s;ed between my Father and me: I &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the Article of the burnt Writings. I knew not whether I mo&s;t wi&s;hed that &s;he &s;hould be ignorant of it, or know it from another Per&s;on. It was in &s;ome Degree impo&s;ing upon her the Nece&s;&s;ity of loving me, and I was de&s;irous of owing all to her own Heart. I dur&s;t not de&s;cribe my Father to her &s;uch as he really was. <HI>Adelaida</HI> was &s;trictly virtuous, and I was &s;en&s;ible, that, to re&s;ign her&s;elf to the Inclination &s;he felt for me, it was nece&s;&s;ary that &s;he &s;hould hope we might be one Day united. I &s;eemed to have great Dependance upon my Mother's Tenderne&s;s for me, and the favourable Di&s;po&s;itions &s;he was in towards us; I intreated <HI>Adelaida</HI> to &s;ee her.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="161">
<Q>Speak to my Mother, (&s;aid &s;he) &s;he knows your Sentiments. I have acknow|ledged mine to her. I found that her Authority was nece&s;&s;ary to give me Strength to combat them, if I &s;hould be obliged to it, or to ju&s;tify me for re|&s;igning my &s;elf up to them without Scruple. She will u&s;e her utmo&s;t Endeavours to prevail upon my Father, to propo&s;e an Accommodation, and to engage the Inter|po&s;ition of our common Relations for that Purpo&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>The Tranquility with which <HI>Adelaida</HI> re&s;ted upon the&s;e Hopes, made me feel my Misfortune more &s;en&s;ibly.</P>
<P><Q>What, if our Fathers &s;hould be inex|orable (&s;aid I to her pre&s;&s;ing her hand,) will not you have Compa&s;&s;ion on a mi|&s;erable Wretch who adores you?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I will do all that I can (an&s;wered &s;he) to regulate my Inclinations by my Duty, but I feel that I &s;hall be wretched, if that Duty is again&s;t you.</Q></P>
<P>The Per&s;ons who had been employed about Madam <HI>de Lu&s;&s;an</HI> then approaching her Daughter, our Di&s;cour&s;e was interrupted. I went to the Bed-&s;ide of the Mother; &s;he received me kindly and a&s;&s;ured me, &s;he would u&s;e every Method in her Power to reconcile our Families. I then went out of
<PB N="161" REF="162">
their Chamber to leave them at Liberty to take &s;ome Repo&s;e. My Conductor, who waited for me in my own, had made no Enquiry about the&s;e new Gue&s;ts, &s;o that I had an Opportunity of being a few Moments with <HI>Adelaida</HI> before I proceeded on my Journey.</P>
<P>I entered her Chamber in a Condition ea&s;ier to be imagined than de&s;cribed. I dreaded that this was the la&s;t Time I &s;hould &s;ee her. I approached the Mother fir&s;t. My Grief pleaded for me. And &s;he was &s;o moved with it that &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf in &s;till kinder Terms, than &s;he had done the Evening before. <HI>Adelaida</HI> was at another End of the Room, I went to her trembling.</P>
<P>'I leave you, my dear <HI>Adelaida,</HI>' &s;aid I. Two or three Times I repeated the &s;ame Words: my Tears which I could not re&s;train, &s;poke the Re&s;t. She wept likewi&s;e.</P>
<P><Q>I &s;hew you my whole Heart, (&s;aid &s;he) but I do not wi&s;h to di&s;gui&s;e it from you, you de&s;erve my Tenderne&s;s. I know not what will be our Fate, but I am re|&s;olved, that my Parents &s;hall di&s;po&s;e of mine.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And why (replied I) &s;hould we &s;ub|ject our&s;elves to the Tyranny of our Pa|rents? Let us leave them to hate each
<PB N="162" REF="163">
other, if they will do it, and let us fly to &s;ome di&s;tant Corner of the World, and be happy in our mutual Tenderne&s;s, which we may make a &s;uperiour Duty to that we owe them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Never let me have &s;uch a propo&s;al from you again, (&s;aid &s;he) give me not Cau&s;e to repent of the Sentiments I have enter|tained for you. My Love may make me unhappy: but it &s;hall never make me criminal. Adieu, (added &s;he giving me her Hand) it is by our Con&s;tancy and Virtue that we ought to endeavour to triumph over our Misfortunes, but what|ever happens, let us re&s;olve to do no|thing which may le&s;&s;en our E&s;teem for each other.</Q></P>
<P>While &s;he &s;poke, I ki&s;&s;ed the dear Hand &s;he had given me, I bathed it with my Tears.
<Q>I mu&s;t always love you, (re|plied I.) Death, if I cannot be yours, will free me from my Mi&s;ery.</Q></P>
<P>My Heart was &s;o pre&s;t with Angui&s;h that I could with Difficulty utter tho&s;e few Words. I ha&s;tily quitted the Room, and mounting my Hor&s;e arrived at the Place where we were to dine without having one Moment cea&s;ed to weep. I gave free Cour&s;e to my Tears, I found a kind of Sweetne&s;s in thus indulging my Grief. When the Heart is truly affected, it takes Plea&s;ure in every
<PB N="163" REF="164">
Thing that di&s;covers to it&s;elf its own Sen|&s;ibility.</P>
<P>The remainder of our Journey pa&s;&s;ed as the Beginning: I had &s;carce uttered a Word during the whole Time. On the third Day we arrived at a Ca&s;tle built near the <HI>Pyrences.</HI> Nothing was to be &s;een about it, but Pines and Cyprus-Trees, &s;teep Rocks, and horrid Precipices, and nothing heard but the Noi&s;e of Torrents ru&s;hing with Vio|lence down tho&s;e frightful Declivities.</P>
<P>This &s;avage Dwelling plea&s;ed me, be|cau&s;e it &s;oothed my Melancholly. I pa&s;&s;ed whole Days in the Woods, and when I returned, unloaded my &s;ad Heart in Letters to my beloved <HI>Adelaida.</HI> This was my only Employment, and my only Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>I will give them to her one Day, thought I, &s;he &s;hall &s;ee by them how I have pa&s;t the Time in her Ab&s;ence. I &s;ometimes received Letters from my Mother, in one of which &s;he gave me Hope. Alas! that was the only happy Moment I ever enjoyed: &s;he informed me that all our Relations were labouring to reconcile our Families, and that there was Room to believe they would &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>After this I received no more Letters for &s;ix Weeks. How tedious were tho&s;e Days of Doubting and Anxiety. Every Morning
<PB N="164" REF="165">
I went into the Road through which the Me&s;&s;engers pa&s;t, and never returned till it was late in the Evening: lingering till Hope and Expectation had nothing left to feed upon, and always returned more wretch|ed, than when I fir&s;t &s;et out.</P>
<P>At length I &s;aw a Man at a Di&s;tance riding towards the Ca&s;tle, I did not doubt but he was a Me&s;&s;enger to me, and in|&s;tead of that eager Impatience I had felt a Moment before I was now &s;eized with Apprehen&s;ion and Dread. I dur&s;t not ad|vance to meet him, &s;omething which I could not account for re&s;trained me. Un|certainty which had hitherto appeared &s;o tormenting, &s;eemed now a Good which I feared to lo&s;e.</P>
<P>My Heart did not deceive me. This Man brought me Letters from my Mo|ther, in which &s;he informed me, that my Father would li&s;ten to no Propo&s;als for an Accommodation, and, to complete my Mi|&s;eries, had re&s;olved upon a Marriage be|tween me and a Daughter of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Foix:</HI> that the Nuptials were to be cele|brated in the Ca&s;tle where I then was, and that my Father would in a few Days come him&s;elf to prepare me for what he de&s;ired of me.</P>
<P>You will ea&s;ily judge, I did not balance a Moment about the Re&s;olution I was to
<PB N="165" REF="166">
take. I waited for my Father's Arrival with Tranquility enough. My Grief was &s;oothed by the Reflection, that I was able to make another &s;acrifice to <HI>Adelaida.</HI> I was convinced &s;he loved me: I loved her too much to doubt it. True Love is always full of Confidence.</P>
<P>My Mother, who had &s;o many Rea&s;ons for wi&s;hing to &s;ee me di&s;engaged from <HI>Adelaida,</HI> had never in any of her Let|ters given me the lea&s;t Cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect &s;he was changed, this compleated my Security; how greatly did the Con&s;tancy of my <HI>Ade|laida</HI> heighten the Ardor of my Pa&s;&s;ion! during the three Days which elap&s;ed before the Arrival of my Father, my Imagination was wholly employed on the new Proof I was &s;hortly to give <HI>Adelaida</HI> of my Pa&s;&s;ion: this Idea notwith&s;tanding my mi&s;erable Si|tuation gave me Sen&s;ations little different from Joy.</P>
<P>The Meeting between my Father and me was on my Side full of Re&s;pect, but Coldne&s;s and Re&s;erve. On his, of Haughtine&s;s and Indifference.</P>
<P><Q>I have given you Lei&s;ure (&s;aid he to me) to repent of your Folly, and I am now come to give you the Means to make me forget it: return this In&s;tance of my In|dulgence, with Obedience, and prepare to receive as you ought, the Count of <HI>Foix,</HI>
<PB N="166" REF="167">
and Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Foix</HI> his Daughter, for whom I have de&s;tined you. The Mar|riage &s;hall be &s;olemni&s;ed here, they will arrive to morrow with your Mother, I came before them only to give the nece&s;&s;a|ry Orders for their Reception.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I am &s;orry, &s;ir, (replied I calmly) that I cannot comply with your wi&s;hes, I have too much Honour to marry a Per&s;on I can never love, therefore I intreat you will permit me to leave this Place directly. Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Foix,</HI> however aimable &s;he may be, cannot alter my Re&s;olution, and if I &s;ee her, the Affront I &s;hall give her by refu&s;ing her Hand, will be more poig|nant to her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>No (interrupted my Father in a Rage) thou &s;halt not &s;ee her, nor &s;halt thou be allowed to &s;ee the Day, I will &s;hut thee up in a Dungeon, a fitter Habitation &mdash; I &s;wear by Heaven, that thou &s;halt never be delivered from thy Confinement till I am convinced thy Repentance is &s;incere, and thy Change certain. I will puni&s;h thee for thy Di&s;obedience every way that is in my Power, I will deprive thee of my E&s;tate and &s;ettle it upon Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Foix,</HI> to fulfill in &s;ome Degree the Pro|mi&s;e I have given her.</Q></P>
<P>I made no Oppo&s;ition to my Father's tyrannical De&s;ign, I &s;uffered my&s;elf to be
<PB N="167" REF="168">
conducted to an old Tower, where I was confined in a Place at the Bottom of it, which received no Light but from a little grated Window which looked into one of the Courts of the Ca&s;tle. My Father gave Orders that Food &s;hould be brought me twice a Day, but that I &s;hould not be &s;uffer|ed to &s;ee any Per&s;on whatever.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t Days of my Confinement with Tranquility enough, and even with &s;ome kind of Plea&s;ure: what I had &s;o lately done for <HI>Adelaida,</HI> employed all my Thoughts, and left no Room for Reflexion upon the Horrors of my Condition; but when this Sentiment began to lo&s;e its Force, I re&s;ign|ed my&s;elf up to De&s;pair, at being thus doomed to an Ab&s;ence of which I knew not the End: my bu&s;y Imagination tortured me with the Apprehen&s;ion of a thou&s;and other Evils, <HI>Adelaida</HI> might be forced to enter in|to another Engagement, I fancied her &s;ur|rounded with Rivals all a&s;&s;iduous to plea&s;e, while I had nothing to plead for me but my Mi&s;eries; but to a Mind &s;o generous as <HI>Adelaida's,</HI> was not this &s;ufficient? I re|proached my&s;elf for entertaining the lea&s;t doubt: I a&s;ked her Pardon for it, as for a Crime, and my Heart gathered new Strength from the Confidence I had in her Fidelity.</P>
<P>My Mother found Means to convey a Letter to my Hands, in which &s;he exhorted me to &s;ubmit to my Father, who&s;e Rage
<PB N="168" REF="169">
again&s;t me &s;eemed to increa&s;e every Day. She added, that &s;he &s;uffered a great deal her|&s;elf, that her Endeavours to procure a Re|conciliation between him and the Family of <HI>Lu&s;&s;an,</HI> had made him &s;u&s;pect that &s;he acted in concert with me.</P>
<P>I was greatly afflicted with the Unea&s;ine&s;s my Mother &s;uffered on my Account, but as I could not accu&s;e my&s;elf of having volun|tarily cau&s;ed her any Part of it, all I could do was to lament her Situation.</P>
<P>One Day when I was as u&s;ual wholly taken up with Reflections on my unhappy Fate, Something fell through the Window into my Dungeon, which immediately rou&s;ed my Attention. I &s;aw a Letter lye on the Floor, I &s;eized it with trembling Ha&s;te: but what became of me when I read the Con|tents, they were as follows:</P>
<P><Q>Your Father's Rage has in&s;tructed me what I ought to do. I know all that your Genero&s;ity concealed from me: I know the terrible Situation you are in, and I know but one Method to extricate you from it, which will perhaps make you more mi&s;erable, but I &s;hall be &s;o as well as you, and that Thought will give me Re&s;olution to do what is required of me. Our cruel Parents, to make it impo&s;&s;ible for me to be yours, in&s;i&s;t upon my marry|ing another. This is the Price your Fa|ther
<PB N="169" REF="170">
has &s;et upon your Liberty, it will perhaps co&s;t me my Life, my Quiet it too &s;urely will to pay it, but I am determined, your Sufferings and your Pri&s;on are at pre|&s;ent all that I can think of, in a fews Days I &s;hall be the Wife of the Marquis <HI>de Be|navides,</HI> his Character is &s;ufficient to ac|quaint me with all I have to &s;uffer from him; but this &s;ort of Fidelity I owe you at lea&s;t, that in the Engagement I enter, I &s;hould find nothing but Mi&s;ery. May you on the contrary be happy, your good Fortune will be my Con&s;olation: I am &s;en&s;ible I ought not to tell you this, if I was truly generous I &s;hould &s;uffer you to be ignorant of the Part you have in my Marriage, I &s;hould leave you in doubt of my Con&s;tancy. I had formed a De&s;ign to do &s;o, but I was not able to execute it, in my &s;ad Situation; I have need of being &s;upported with the Thought that the Remembrance of me, will not be hate|ful to you. Alas, &s;oon, very &s;oon it will not be permitted me to pre&s;erve yours &mdash; I mu&s;t forget you &mdash; at lea&s;t I mu&s;t en|deavour &s;o to do. Of all my Mi&s;eries this is what I am mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of: you will increa&s;e it, if you do not carefully avoid all Opportunities of &s;eeing and &s;peaking to me. Reflect that you owe me this Mark of your E&s;teem, and oh reflect how dear that E&s;teem will be to me, &s;ince of all tho&s;e Sentiments you have profe&s;t for
<PB N="170" REF="171">
me, it is the only one that I am allowed to require of you.</Q></P>
<P>Of this fatal Letter, which I have related at length, I was able to read no more than to the&s;e Words:
<Q>Our cruel Fathers to make it impo&s;&s;ible for me to be yours, in|&s;i&s;t upon my marrying another.</Q>
Pierced to the Heart with this cruel, this unexpected Misfortune, I &s;unk upon the Mattra&s;s which compo&s;ed my Bed, and lay there for &s;everal Hours without Sen&s;e or Motion, and proba|bly might never have recovered, but for the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Per&s;on who brought me my Provi&s;ions. If he was alarmed at the Con|dition in which he found me, he was much more &s;o at the Exce&s;s of my De&s;pair, when my Sen&s;es returned. The Letter which I had held fa&s;t in my Hand, during my Swoon, and which I at la&s;t read quite through, was wet with my Tears, and I &s;poke and acted Extravagancies, which made him apprehen|&s;ive for my Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>This Man, who till then had been inac|ce&s;&s;ible to Pity, was melted all on a &s;udden: he blamed my Father for his cruel Treat|ment of me, he reproved him&s;elf for having executed his Orders, he a&s;ked my Pardon on his Knees. His Repentance in&s;pired me with the Thought of propo&s;ing to him, to let me quit my Pri&s;on for eight Days only, promi&s;ing him that at the Expiration of that
<PB N="171" REF="172">
Time, I would return and put my&s;elf into his Hands. I added every thing that I could think of, to oblige him to con&s;ent: moved at the State he &s;aw me in, excited by his own Intere&s;t, and by the Fear that I &s;hould one Day take Vengence upon him for being the In&s;trument of my Father's Cruelty, he agreed to what I de&s;ired, upon the Condition I had my&s;elf propo&s;ed to him.</P>
<P>I would have &s;et out that Moment from the Ca&s;tle, but there was a Nece&s;&s;ity for his going to &s;eek for Hor&s;es, and when he re|turned he informed me that we could not get any 'till the next Day. My De&s;ign was to go to <HI>Adelaida,</HI> to tell her all my Grief and De&s;pair, and to kill my&s;elf before her Eyes, if &s;he per&s;i&s;ted in her Re&s;olution. To execute this Project, it was nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould arrive before her fatal Mar|riage, and every Moment's Delay &s;eemed to me an Age of Mi&s;ery. I read over her Let|ter an hundred Times, as if I had expected to find &s;till &s;omething more in it; I examin|ed the Date over and over, I flattered my&s;elf that the Time might have been prolonged.</P>
<P><Q>She will at lea&s;t make an Effort (&s;aid I) &s;he will &s;eize all Pretences to defer it: but why &s;hould I flatter my&s;elf with &s;o vain a Hope (re&s;umed I) <HI>Adelaida</HI> &s;acrificing her|&s;elf for my Liberty, will ha&s;ten the dread|ful Moment. Alas! can &s;he believe that Liberty without her can be a Ble&s;&s;ing to

me? I &s;hall every where find this Pri&s;on &s;he delivers me from, &s;he has never known my Heart, &s;he judges of me by other Men. It is to that I owe my Ruin: I am &s;till more mi&s;erable than I believe my&s;elf, &s;ince I have not the Con&s;olation to think that &s;he knows how much I love her.</Q></P>
<P>I pa&s;t the whole Night in making the&s;e Complaints, the mo&s;t tedious Night I had ever known, even in that Place of Mi&s;ery. At length the Day appeared, I mounted on Hor&s;eback with my Conductor, we travelled the whole Day without &s;topping a Moment, when towards the Evening I perceived my Mother in a Chariot which took the Road towards the Ca&s;tle. She knew me imme|diately, and after having expre&s;&s;ed her Sur|prize at meeting me, &s;he obliged me to come into the Chariot to her. I dur&s;t not a&s;k her the Occa&s;ion of her Journey, in the Situa|tion I was in, I feared every thing, and my Fear was but too well founded.</P>
<P><Q>I come my Son (&s;aid &s;he) by your Fa|ther's Permi&s;&s;ion to relea&s;e you from your Confinement.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ah! (cried I) then <HI>Adelaida</HI> is marri|ed.</Q>
My Mother an&s;wered only by Si|lence: my Misfortune, which was then without Remedy, pre&s;ented it&s;elf to my Mind with all its horrid Agravations. I fell into a kind of Stupidity, and by the
<PB N="173" REF="174">
Force of Grief, I &s;eemed to have lo&s;t the Sen&s;e of it.</P>
<P>However my Body &s;oon &s;unk under the Weakne&s;s of my Mind: I was &s;eized in the Coach with a Shivering like the cold Fit of an Ague. As &s;oon as we arrived at the Ca&s;tle, my Mother cau&s;ed me to be put to Bed, I lay two Days without &s;peaking or taking any Nouri&s;hment, all the Symptoms of a violent Fever appeared, and on the Fourth, the Phy&s;icians de&s;paired of my Life. My Mother, who never left me, was inconceivably afflicted, her Tears, her Prayers, and the Name of <HI>Adelaida,</HI> in which &s;he conjured me to live, made me re&s;olve not to ob&s;truct the Endeavours of the Phy&s;icians to &s;ave me. After &s;uffering fif|teen Days the Agonies of a mo&s;t violent Fever, I began, tho' by &s;low Degrees, to recover: the fir&s;t thing I did, when I was able to attend to any thing, was to &s;eek for the Letter I had received from <HI>Adelaida.</HI> My Mother, who had taken it from me, for fear it &s;hould increa&s;e my Affliction, was obliged to re&s;tore it to me: after I had read it &s;everal times, I put it into a little &s;ilk Bag, and placed it on my Heart, where I had always kept her Picture, and whenever I was alone it was always my Employment to gaze upon that lovely Picture and to read that Letter.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="175">My Mother, who was of a &s;oft and ten|der Di&s;po&s;ition, &s;hared in my Grief: &s;he likewi&s;e thought it be&s;t to yield to my fir&s;t Tran&s;ports, and leave it to Time to fini&s;h my Cure.</P>
<P>She permitted me to &s;peak of <HI>Adelaida,</HI> and &s;ometimes was the fir&s;t to mention her to me, and perceiving that the only Thing which gave me Con&s;olation, was the Thought of being loved by her, &s;he told me that it was &s;he her&s;elf who had determined <HI>Adelaida</HI> to marry.</P>
<P><Q>I a&s;k your Pardon my dear Son (&s;aid &s;he) for the Grief I have cau&s;ed you, I did not imagine you would have felt her Lo&s;s &s;o deeply: I trembled for your Health, and even your Life, while you continued under that cruel Confinement. I knew your Father's inflexible Temper, and was convinced he would never &s;et you at Li|berty, while there was a Po&s;&s;ibility of your marrying Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Lu&s;&s;an:</HI> I re|&s;olved to &s;peak to that generous young Lady; I told her my Fears for your Health, &s;he partook in them, &s;he felt them per|haps with more Force even than I did. From that Moment I &s;aw her u&s;e every Endeavour to ha&s;ten her Marriage, for her Father, ju&s;tly irritated at the Proceed|ings of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Comminge,</HI> had long pre&s;&s;ed her to marry: hitherto &s;he had re|&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="175" REF="176">
his Solicitations and even his Com|mands. I a&s;ked her which of tho&s;e Per|&s;ons who addre&s;&s;ed her &s;he would chu&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It matters not which, (replied &s;he) they are all equal to me, &s;ince I cannot be his to whom I have given my Heart.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Two Days after I had this Conver&s;ation with her, I learned that the Marquis <HI>de Be|navides</HI> was preferred to all his Rivals, every one was &s;urprized at her Choice, and I as much as any other.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Benavides</HI> has a di&s;agreeable Per&s;on, his Under&s;tanding is mean, and his Temper ex|tremely bad: this la&s;t Circum&s;tance made me tremble for poor <HI>Adelaida,</HI> I was re&s;olved to tell her my Apprehen&s;ions, I went for that Purpo&s;e to the Hou&s;e of the Counte&s;s <HI>de Garlande,</HI> where we u&s;ed to meet.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I am prepared (&s;aid &s;he) for Mi&s;ery, but I mu&s;t marry, and &s;ince I know it is the only Means of procuring your Son's Liberty, I reproach my&s;elf every Moment that I delay this Sacrifice. Yet this Mar|riage which I con&s;ent to only for his Sake, will perhaps be the mo&s;t cruel of his Mis|fortunes: I will at lea&s;t convince him by my Choice, that his Intere&s;t was the &s;ole Motive which engaged me to it. Pity me, dear Madam, I de&s;erve your Pity, and by my Behaviour to Mon&s;ieur <HI>Benavides,</HI>
<PB N="176" REF="177">
I will endeavour to render my&s;elf worthy of your E&s;teem.</Q></P>
<P>My Mother afterwards told me that <HI>Ade|laida</HI> was made acquainted by my Father him&s;elf, with my having burnt the Writings, he publickly upbraided her with it on the Day that he lo&s;t his Proce&s;s. She confe&s;t to me (added my Mother) that &s;he was more affected with your extreme Delicacy in concealing &s;o generous an Action, than with the Action it&s;elf.</P>
<P>We pa&s;t the Days in &s;uch Conver&s;a|tions, my Melancholly was exce&s;&s;ive, yet, tho' deprived of Hope, I found a kind of Sweetne&s;s in the Idea of my being &s;till loved.</P>
<P>After a Stay of two Months, my Mother received Orders from my Father to return to him. He had expre&s;&s;ed no Concern for my Illne&s;s, and his cruel Treatment of me had extingui&s;hed every Sentiment of Ten|derne&s;s for him. My Mother pre&s;&s;ed me to go with her, but I intreated her to con&s;ent to my &s;taying in the Country, &s;he yielded to my Rea&s;ons and left me.</P>
<P>I was now once more alone in the mid&s;t of my Woods, and found &s;o much Sweet|ne&s;s in Solitude, that I would then have abandoned every Thing, and taken up my Habitation in &s;ome Hermit's Cell, had I not
<PB N="177" REF="178">
been re&s;trained by my Tenderne&s;s for my Mother. I often re&s;olved to endeavour to &s;ee <HI>Adelaida,</HI> but the Fear of di&s;plea&s;ing her &s;topt me. At length after long Irre&s;olution, I thought I might at lea&s;t attempt to &s;ee <HI>Adelaida</HI> without being &s;een by her.</P>
<P>Accordingly I re&s;olved to &s;end a Per|&s;on, in whom I could confide to <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> to know where &s;he was, and for this Pur|po&s;e I fixed upon a Man who had attended me from my Infancy: my Mother, during my Illne&s;s, had re&s;tored him to his Place about me, he had been with me at the Baths, he knew <HI>Adelaida,</HI> and when I men|tioned my De&s;ign to him, he informed me that he had Friends in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bena|vides.</HI></P>
<P>After having given him his Orders, which I repeated a thou&s;and Times, I cau&s;ed him to &s;et out from the Ca&s;tle. When he arrived at <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> he was informed that <HI>Bena|vides</HI> had carried his Lady a &s;hort Time after their Marriage to an E&s;tate which he had in <HI>Bi&s;cay. Saint Laurent,</HI> for that was my Servant's Name, wrote to me to know what he was to do next. I &s;ent him Orders to go immediately into <HI>Bi&s;cay,</HI> my De&s;ire of &s;eeing <HI>Adelaida,</HI> was &s;o much increa&s;ed by the Hope I had conceived, that it was not po&s;&s;ible for me to oppo&s;e it any longer.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="179"><HI>Saint Laurent</HI> returned at the Expiration of &s;ix Weeks, which my Anxiety and Im|patience had lenghtened into Ages. He told me that after many fruitle&s;s Attempts, <HI>Be|navides</HI> having had Occa&s;ion for an Archi|tect, he had prevailed upon his Friend to pre&s;ent him to him in that Quality, that having acquired &s;ome Knowledge of the Art from an Uncle under who&s;e Care he had been brought up, he made no &s;cruple to undertake the Bu&s;ine&s;s <HI>Benavides</HI> employ|ed him in.</P>
<P><Q>I believe (&s;aid he) that Madam <HI>de Be|navides</HI> knew me, for &s;he blu&s;hed when &s;he fir&s;t &s;aw me.</Q>
He then told me that &s;he lived the mo&s;t retired and melancholly Life imaginable, that her Hu&s;band hardly ever quitted her a Moment, and that it was &s;aid in the Hou&s;e he was exce&s;&s;ively fond of her, but that he gave her no other Proof of it, than by his extreme Jealou&s;y, which he carried &s;o far, that even his Brother had not the Liberty of &s;eeing her, but when he was pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked my Servant &s;ome Que&s;tions about that Brother, he told me that he was a very aimiable young Man, and that the World &s;poke as much in his Favour, as they did to the Di&s;advantage of <HI>Benavides,</HI> and that he appeared to be greatly attached to his Si&s;ter-in-law.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="180">This Di&s;cour&s;e made no Impre&s;&s;ion upon me at that Time, the unhappy Situation of Madam <HI>de Benavides</HI> and the De&s;ire of &s;ee|ing her, employed my whole Soul. <HI>Saint Laurent</HI> a&s;&s;ured me he had taken pro|per Mea&s;ures for introducing me into the Hou&s;e of <HI>Benavides.</HI></P>
<P><Q>He has Occa&s;ion for a Painter (&s;aid he to me) to paint an Apartment, I pro|mi&s;ed to bring him a good one, and you mu&s;t undertake this Bu&s;ine&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>Nothing now remained but to regulate our Departure, I wrote to my Mother, and told her I was going to pa&s;s &s;ome Time at the Hou&s;e of one of my Friends. This done I &s;et out with <HI>Saint Laurent</HI> for <HI>Bi&s;cay;</HI> during our Journey, I was continually a&s;k|ing him Que&s;tions, concerning Madam <HI>de Benavides,</HI> I was de&s;irous of knowing the &s;lighte&s;t Particulars relating to her. <HI>Saint Laurent</HI> was not able to &s;atisfy my Curio&s;ity, he had but few Opportunities of &s;eeing her, &s;he was &s;hut up in her own Apartment, with no other Company than a little Dog, of which &s;he was extremely fond. This Arti|cle touched me particularly, I had pre&s;ented her with that Dog, and I flattered my&s;elf that &s;he loved it for my Sake. The&s;e little things which e&s;cape one in good Fortune, affect one &s;en&s;ibly in Mi&s;ery: the Heart in the Need it has of Con&s;olation, fa&s;tens upon every Thing which is likely to afford it.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="181"><HI>Saint Laurent</HI> often mentioned to me the great Attachment of young <HI>Benavides,</HI> to his Si&s;ter-in-law, he added, that he often op|po&s;ed the furious Sallies of his Brother's Temper, and, but for his good Offices, <HI>Adelaida</HI> would be &s;till more mi&s;erable than &s;he was. He earne&s;tly intreated me to be contented with the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing her, and to make no Attempt to &s;peak to her.</P>
<P><Q>Not becau&s;e it would endanger your Life (added he) that, I know, is too weak a Motive to re&s;train you: but be|cau&s;e &s;he will &s;uffer by any Imprudence you may be guilty of.</Q></P>
<P>The Liberty of &s;eeing <HI>Adelaida,</HI> appeared to me &s;o great a Ble&s;&s;ing, that I was fully per&s;uaded that alone would &s;atisfy me, and I re&s;olved within my&s;elf, and promi&s;ed <HI>Saint Laurent</HI> to behave with the utmo&s;t Circum|&s;pection.</P>
<P>After a mo&s;t tedious Journey, as my Im|patience made it &s;eem, we arrived at <HI>Bi&s;cay,</HI> and I was pre&s;ented to <HI>Benavides,</HI> who &s;et me to work immediately.</P>
<P>The &s;uppo&s;ed Architect and I were lodged in the &s;ame Apartment, and to him was committed the Care of over&s;eeing the Work|men. I had been &s;everal Days at work be|fore I &s;aw Madam <HI>de Benavides,</HI> at length I perceived her one Evening from a Window in
<PB N="181" REF="182">
my own Room, going to walk in the Garden, &s;he had only her little favourite Dog with her, her Dre&s;s was negligent, a kind of langui&s;hing Melancholly appeared in her Looks and Mo|tions, and her fine Eyes &s;eemed to dwell on the Objects around her without regarding them.</P>
<P>Oh, Heavens! what &s;weetly painful Emo|tions did my Soul feel at the Sight of her: I continued leaning on the Window the whole Time &s;he &s;taid in the Garden; it was dark when &s;he returned, &s;o that I could not di|&s;tingui&s;h her when &s;he pa&s;t by my Window, but my Heart knew it was her.</P>
<P>I &s;aw her a &s;econd Time in the Chapel of the Ca&s;tle, I placed my&s;elf in &s;uch a Manner that I could look at her the whole Time without being ob&s;erved. She never once turned her Eyes upon me, I ought to have rejoiced at this Circum&s;tance, &s;ince I well knew that if &s;he di&s;covered me, &s;he would be obliged to go out of the Chapel, yet I was afflicted at it, and returned to my Chamber in greater Di&s;quiet than when I left it. I had not yet formed any De&s;ign of making my&s;elf known to her, but I was &s;en&s;ible that I &s;hould not be able to re&s;i&s;t doing it if any Opportunity offered.</P>
<P>The Sight of young <HI>Benavides</HI> gave me likewi&s;e &s;ome kind of Unea&s;ine&s;s, he often came to &s;ee me work; and notwith&s;tand|ing the &s;eeming Di&s;tance of our Rank, he
<PB N="182" REF="183">
behaved to me with an obliging Familiarity which ought to have excited my E&s;teem, yet it had no Effect upon me. His great Merit, and the Aimiablene&s;s of his Per&s;on which I could not but be &s;en&s;ible of, with|held my Gratitude, I was afraid of a Rival in him, and a certain impa&s;&s;ioned Sadne&s;s which I perceived in him, which was too like my own, not to proceed from the &s;ame Cau&s;e, gave me a Su&s;picion, which be &s;oon confirmed.</P>
<P>After a&s;king me one Day &s;everal Que|&s;tions, relating to my Condition in Life.</P>
<P><Q>You are in Love (&s;aid he to me &s;ighing imperceptibly to him&s;elf,) the Melancholy in which I perceive you plunged conti|nually, per&s;uades me that your Heart is not well, tell me the Truth, can I do any Thing for you? the Mi&s;erable in ge|neral have a Claim to my Compa&s;&s;ion, but there is one &s;ort of Grief which I pity more than any other.</Q></P>
<P>I believe I thanked <HI>Don Gabriel</HI> (that was his Name) with a very ill Grace, for the kind Offers he made to me. How|ever I could not help owning to him that I was in Love. But I told him that Time only could produce any Change in the State of my Fortune.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="184">
<Q>You are not ab&s;olutely unhappy then (replied he) &s;ince you may hope for a Change, I know Per&s;ons who are much more to be pitied than you.</Q></P>
<P>When I was alone I reflected upon the Conver&s;ation that had pa&s;&s;ed between <HI>Don Gabriel</HI> and my&s;elf. I concluded that he was in Love, and that his charming Si&s;ter-in-Law was the Object of his Pa&s;&s;ion, his whole Behaviour which I examined with the utmo&s;t Attention convinced me I was not mi&s;taken: I ob&s;erved him always a&s;&s;i|duous about <HI>Adelaida,</HI> he gazed on her with Eyes like mine, yet I was not jealous, my E&s;teem for <HI>Adelaida</HI> would not admit of &s;uch an injurious Sentiment, but I could not help fearing, that the Company of an agreeable Man who was continually rendering her Services that &s;oftened the Horrors of her pre&s;ent Situation, would make her reflections on me be greatly to my Di&s;advantage, who&s;e Pa&s;&s;ion had been productive of nothing but Misfortunes to her.</P>
<P>I was full of the&s;e Thoughts when one Day I &s;aw <HI>Adelaida</HI> enter the Room where I was painting, led by <HI>Don Gabriel.</HI></P>
<P><Q>Why (&s;aid &s;he) do you pre&s;s me to come and look at the Ornaments of this Apartment? You know I have no Ta&s;te for the&s;e Things.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="185">
<Q>I hope, Madam, (&s;aid I, looking ear|ne&s;tly upon her, and bowing low) that if you will deign to ca&s;t your Eyes upon what is here, you will find &s;omething not unworthy your Attention.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Adelaida,</HI> &s;truck with the Sound of my Voice, turned in&s;tantly towards me, I per|ceived &s;he knew me, for &s;he blu&s;hed and bent her Eyes on the Ground, and after pau&s;ing a Moment, &s;he left the Room with|out giving me a Look, &s;aying, that the Smell of the Paint was di&s;agreeable to her.</P>
<P>I remained behind, terrified, confu&s;ed and overwhelmed with Grief. <HI>Adelaida</HI> had not deigned to give me a &s;econd Look, &s;he would not even &s;hew that &s;he was enough intere&s;ted in my Di&s;gui&s;e to expre&s;s any Signs of Re&s;entment at it.</P>
<P>What have I done (&s;aid I) I am indeed come hither contrary to her Commands, but if &s;he &s;till loved me &s;he would pardon a Fault that proceeded from the Exce&s;s of my Pa&s;&s;ion for her.</P>
<P>I now concluded, that &s;ince <HI>Adelaida</HI> no longer loved me, &s;he mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity have be&s;towed her Heart upon another. This Idea filled me with a Grief &s;o new and violent, that I thought I had never been truly mi&s;erable till then. <HI>Saint-Laurent,</HI> who came from Time to Time to &s;ee me,
<PB N="185" REF="186">
entering the Room that Moment, found me in an Agitation that made him tremble.</P>
<P><Q>What ails you, Mon&s;ieur, (&s;aid he to me) what has happened to you?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I am undone, (replied I) <HI>Adelaida</HI> no longer loves me, &s;he no longer loves me (repeated I) It is but too true. Alas! I never had Rea&s;on to complain of my Fate till this cruel Moment, what Torments would I now endure to purcha&s;e this Ble&s;|&s;ing which I have lo&s;t! This Ble&s;&s;ing which I preferred to all Things and which in the Mid&s;t of my greate&s;t Mi&s;eries filled my Heart with &s;o &s;oft a Joy.</Q></P>
<P>I continued a long Time to exclaim in this Manner, while <HI>Saint-Laurent</HI> in vain endeavoured to draw from me the Cau&s;e of my Grief. At length, I related to him what had happened.
<Q>I &s;ee nothing in all this (&s;aid he) which ought to drive you to the De&s;pair I &s;ee you in. Mad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m <HI>de Bena|vides</HI> is certainly offended at your ra&s;h At|tempt. She was de&s;irous of puni&s;hing you by appearing indifferent, and perhaps &s;he was apprehen&s;ive of betraying her&s;elf if &s;he had looked upon you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>No no (interrupted I) they who love have not &s;uch Command over them&s;elves in tho&s;e fir&s;t Emotions, the Heart alone is li&s;tened to. I mu&s;t &s;ee her (added I) I
<PB N="186" REF="187">
mu&s;t reproach her with her Change. Alas! After giving her&s;elf to another, ought &s;he to take away my Life by &s;o cruel an Indifference? Why did &s;he not leave me in my Pri&s;on, there I &s;hould have been happy, had I been a&s;&s;ured of her Love?</Q></P>
<P><HI>Saint-Laurent</HI> fearing that any one &s;hould &s;ee me in the Condition I was in, obliged me to retire to the Chamber where we both lay. I pa&s;t the whole Night in tormenting my&s;elf, my Thoughts were at Strife with each others in one Moment, I condemned my Su&s;picions, and the next relap&s;ed into them again. I thought it unju&s;t to wi&s;h that <HI>Adelaida</HI> &s;hould pre&s;erve a Tenderne&s;s which rendered her mi&s;erable. In tho&s;e Moments I reproached my&s;elf for loving her le&s;s than my own Satisfaction.</P>
<P><Q>Why &s;hould I wi&s;h to live? (&s;aid I to <HI>Saint-Laurent</HI>) if &s;he loves another, I will endeavour to &s;peak to her only to bid her an eternal Adieu. She &s;hall hear no Reproaches from my Mouth, my Grief which I cannot conceal from her, &s;hall &s;peak for me.</Q></P>
<P>When this Point was re&s;olved upon, it was agreed that I &s;hould leave <HI>Bi&s;cay</HI> as &s;oon as I &s;hould have an Interview with her, we then began to con&s;ider upon the nece&s;&s;ary Means of procuring it. <HI>Saint-Laurent</HI>
<PB N="187" REF="188">
told me that we mu&s;t &s;eize the fir&s;t Opportunity that offered, when <HI>Don Gabriel</HI> went to hunt, as he often did, and <HI>Benavides</HI> employed in his dome&s;tic Affairs, for which he always &s;et apart two Mornings in a Week.</P>
<P>He then made me promi&s;e, that, to avoid giving any Su&s;picion, I &s;hould go on with my painting as u&s;ual: but that I &s;hould likewi&s;e declare, that I was under a Nece&s;&s;ity of returning &s;oon to my own Country.</P>
<P>Accordingly I re&s;umed my former Em|ployment; I had almo&s;t, without perceiv|ing it, &s;ome Hope that <HI>Adelaida</HI> would come again into that Apartment.

<P>At length this Moment came. I was going as u&s;ual to my Work, when I &s;aw <HI>Adelaida</HI> pa&s;&s;ing to her own Apartment.

<P><Q>Do not fly from me, Madam, (&s;aid I to her) &s;uffer me this la&s;t Time to enjoy the Ble&s;&s;ing of beholding you. I &s;hall never importune you more.

<P><HI>Adelaida,</HI> who&s;e Surpri&s;e had hitherto prevented her from &s;peaking, interrupted me at the&s;e Words, and giving me a Look of mingled Tenderne&s;s and Anger.</P>
<P>'What, (&s;aid &s;he) dare you make me Re|proaches? 'Dare you &s;u&s;pect me? &mdash; you.</P>
<P>The Tone, with which &s;he pronounced this la&s;t Word, brought me in&s;tantly at her Feet.</P>
<P><Q>No, my dear <HI>Adelaida,</HI> (interrupted I) no, I have no Su&s;picion that is injurious to you. Pardon a few di&s;tracted Words, which my Heart di&s;avows.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="190">
<Q>I Pardon you all, (&s;aid &s;he to me) provided you depart immediately and never attempt to &s;ee me more. Re|flect that it is for your Sake I am the mo&s;t mi&s;erable Creature in the World, would you give me Cau&s;e to reproach my&s;elf with being the mo&s;t criminal.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I will do every thing you command me, (replied I) but only promi&s;e that you will not hate me.</Q></P>
<P>Although <HI>Adelaida</HI> had &s;everal times de|&s;ired me to ri&s;e, yet I &s;till continued at her Feet. To tho&s;e who truly love, this Attitude has a thou&s;and &s;ecret Charms. I was &s;till kneeling when <HI>Benavides</HI> &s;uddenly opened the Chamber Door. Tran&s;ported with rage, he flew towards his Wife, and drawing his Sword.</P>
<P>'Thou &s;halt die, perfidious Woman,' (cried he) and would have infallibly kil|led her, had I not thrown my&s;elf be|tween them, and put by his Sword with my own.</P>
<P><Q>Wretch! (cried <HI>Benavides</HI>) you fir&s;t &s;hall feel my Vengeance!</Q>
And at the &s;ame Time gave me a Wound on my Shoulder. I did not love Life well enough to be &s;o|licitous for the Pre&s;ervation of it: but my hatred to <HI>Benavides</HI> would not &s;uffer me to abandon it to his Fury, this cruel At|tempt
<PB N="190" REF="191">
upon the Per&s;on of his Wife deprived me almo&s;t of Rea&s;on. I threw my&s;elf upon him, and plunging my Sword in his Body, he fell at my Feet without Sen&s;e or Motion.</P>
<P>The Servants, drawn by the Cries of Madam <HI>de Benavides,</HI> entered the Room that Moment, and &s;everal of them throw|ing them&s;elves upon me, di&s;armed me while I made no Effort to defend my&s;elf. The Sight of Madam <HI>de Benavides</HI> bathed in Tears, and kneeling by her Hu&s;band, left me no Sen&s;ibility of any Thing but her Grief. I was dragged out of her Cham|ber into another, and the Door fa&s;tened upon me.</P>
<P>There it was, that, delivered up to my own Reflections, I &s;aw the Aby&s;s into which I had plunged Madam <HI>de Benavides,</HI> the Death of her Hu&s;band, killed before her Eyes, and killed by me, could not fail of giving ri&s;e to Su&s;picions again&s;t her. What Reproaches did I not make my&s;elf! I had been the Cau&s;e of her fir&s;t Misfortunes, and I had now compleated her Ruin by my Imprudence.</P>
<P>My Imagination continually repre&s;ented to me the dreadful Condition in which I had left her. I acknowledged that &s;he had ju&s;t Rea&s;on to hate me, and I did not murmur at it. The only Consolation I
<PB N="191" REF="192">
had, was in the Hope that I was not known: the Idea of being taken for an A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in and a Robber, which on any other Occa&s;ion would have made me tremble with Horror, now gave me Joy. <HI>Adelaida</HI> knew the Innocence of my Intentions, and <HI>Adelaida</HI> was the whole World to me.</P>
<P>Impatient to be interrogated, that I might clear the Honor of <HI>Adelaida,</HI> I pa&s;t &s;everal Hours in the mo&s;t racking Inquietude; in the Middle of the Night my Chamber Door was opened, and I &s;aw <HI>Don Gabriel</HI> enter.</P>
<P><Q>Be not apprehen&s;ive of any Harm, (&s;aid he to me, as he approached) I come by the Command of Madam <HI>de Benavides,</HI> &s;he has had E&s;teem enough for me to tru&s;t me with every Thing relating to you, probably, (added he, with a Sigh which he could not &s;uppre&s;s) &s;he would have judged differently if &s;he had known me well, but I will be ju&s;t to her Con|fidence. I will &s;ave you, and I will &s;ave her, if I can.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You &s;hall not &s;ave me, (replied I) I ought to ju&s;tify the innocence of Madam <HI>de Benavides,</HI> and I will do it at the Expence of a thou&s;and Lives, if I had them to lo&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>I then acquainted him with my De&s;ign of keeping my&s;elf concealed, and pa&s;&s;ing
<PB N="192" REF="193">
for an A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in to prevent any Imputation falling upon her.</P>
<P><Q>This Project might be nece&s;&s;ary, (re|plied <HI>Don Gabriel</HI>) if my Brother was dead as I perceive you think. But his wound, altho' great, is probably not mortal, and the fir&s;t Sign of Life and Sen&s;e he had given, was to order that Madam <HI>de Bena|vides</HI> &s;hould be confined to her own Apartment. This proves that he &s;u&s;pects you are her Lover, and if you per&s;i&s;t in your De&s;ign, you will lo&s;e your own Life without pre&s;erving hers. Let us go, (added he) the Safety I offer you to|day, I probably cannot afford you to|morrow.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And what will become of Madam <HI>de Benavides</HI>? (cried I) No I can never re|&s;olve to withdraw my&s;elf from Danger, and to leave her in it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I have already told you, (replied <HI>Don Gabriel</HI>) that your Pre&s;ence will only render her Situation wor&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Well, (&s;aid I &s;ighing) I will fly &s;ince you will have it &s;o, and that her Intere&s;t demands it. I had hoped that by the Sa|crifice I intended to make her of my Life, I &s;hould at lea&s;t have been pitied by her: but I de&s;erve not to have this Con|&s;olation. I am an unhappy Wretch, who
<PB N="193" REF="194">
am not even worthy to die for her. Pro|tect her (added I, to <HI>Don Gabriel,</HI> the Tears &s;treaming from my Eyes as I &s;poke) you are generous; her Innocence, her Misfortunes mu&s;t move you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You may judge (&s;aid he) by what has e&s;caped me, that I am too much for my own Quiet concerned in the Fate of Ma|dam <HI>de Benavides.</HI> I will do every Thing for her. Alas! (added he) I &s;hould have thought my&s;elf well paid, if I could have flattered my&s;elf that &s;he had loved no one. How is it po&s;&s;ible that you &s;hould not be &s;atisfied with your good Fortune in having touched a Heart like hers? But let us go, (pur&s;ued he) let us take Advantage of the Night.</Q></P>
<P>Then taking my Hand and turning a dark Lanthorn, he led me through the Courts of the Ca&s;tle. Tran&s;ported with Rage again&s;t my&s;elf for what I had done, in the Wildne&s;s of my De&s;pair, I wi&s;hed my&s;elf &s;till more mi&s;erable than I was.</P>
<P><HI>Don Gabriel</HI> when he left me, advi&s;ed me to retire to a Convent of Religious which was within a Quarter of a League of the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P><Q>You mu&s;t (&s;aid he) keep your&s;elf con|cealed in their Hou&s;e for &s;ome Days, that you may not be in Danger from the Search
<PB N="194" REF="195">
I my&s;elf &s;hall be obliged to make for you; and here is a Letter for one of tho&s;e Re|ligious, which will procure you Admi&s;&s;ion into the Hou&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>I loitered a long Time about the Ca&s;tle after he left me, not being able to remove my&s;elf far from the Place where <HI>Adelaida</HI> was; at length the De&s;ire of hearing all that happened to her, determined me to &s;et out for the Convent.</P>
<P>I arrived there ju&s;t at Day-break: the Religious to whom I delivered <HI>Don Gabriel's</HI> Letter, received me very civilly, and car|ried me into a Chamber near his own. My Palene&s;s and the Blood he ob&s;erved upon my Cloaths, made him apprehen&s;ive that I was wounded. He was begining to enquire af|ter my Health, when I fainted away: with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Servant he put me into Bed, and &s;ent for the Surgeon belonging to the Convent to examine my Wound: he declared that it was in a dangerous Condi|tion, through the Fatigue and Cold I had &s;uffered.</P>
<P>When I was alone with the good Father to whom I was recommended, I intreated him to &s;end to a Hou&s;e in a certain Village I named to him, to enquire for <HI>Saint Lau|rent,</HI> for I &s;uppo&s;ed he would take Refuge there. I was not mi&s;taken, he came with the Me&s;&s;enger I had &s;ent to him: the poor
<PB N="195" REF="196">
Fellow was in exce&s;&s;ive Affliction when he heard that I was wounded, he approached my Bed-&s;ide, and anxiou&s;ly enquired how I did.</P>
<P><Q>If you would &s;ave my Life (&s;aid I to him) you mu&s;t learn in what State Madam <HI>de Benavides</HI> is: inform your&s;elf of all that has pa&s;&s;ed. Ha&s;te, lo&s;e not a Moment, and remember that what I &s;uffer in this Uncertainty, is ten thou&s;and times wor&s;e than Death.</Q>
<HI>Saint Laurent</HI> promi&s;ed to do every Thing I de&s;ired, and went away to take proper Mea&s;ures for &s;atisfying me.</P>
<P>Mean Time I was &s;eized with a violent Fever, my Wound grew more dangerous, they were obliged to make large Inci&s;ions, but the Torments of my Mind made me almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible to tho&s;e of my Body; the Image of Madam <HI>de Benavides</HI> bathed in Tears, as I had &s;een her when I left her Chamber, and kneeling by her Hu&s;band whom I had wounded, was continually be|fore my Eyes. I took a Review of the Mis|fortunes of her Life, I found my&s;elf in all; her Marriage to which &s;he was forced on my Account, her fatal Choice of the mo&s;t jealous and brutal Man in the World for a Hu&s;band, was made for my Sake, and I had lately compleated all her Misfortunes by ex|po&s;ing her Reputation to injurious Cen&s;ures. I called to my Remembrance the unju&s;t Jea|lou&s;y I had di&s;covered, which, although it
<PB N="196" REF="197">
had la&s;ted but a few Moments, and was bani&s;hed by a &s;ingle Word from her, yet I could never pardon my&s;elf for. <HI>Adelaida</HI> could not but think me unworthy of her E&s;|teem, &s;he could do no otherwi&s;e than hate me. This melancholly Apprehen&s;ion I &s;up|ported by the Rage with which I was ani|mated again&s;t my&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Saint Laurent</HI> returned the next Day, he informed me that <HI>Benavides</HI> was &s;till ex|tremely ill of his Wound, that <HI>Adelaida</HI> was in the utmo&s;t Affliction, and that <HI>Don Gabriel</HI> made a &s;hew of &s;eeking for me every where.</P>
<P>This News was not very likely to calm the Perturbations of my Mind. I knew not what I ought to wi&s;h for, every Thing was again&s;t me, I could not even wi&s;h for Death, I thought I owed the Prolongation of my wretched Life to the Ju&s;tification of Madam <HI>de Benavides.</HI></P>
<P>The good Father to whom I was recom|mended, beheld me with great Compa&s;&s;ion, he heard me &s;igh continually, and always found my Face bathed in Tears. He was a Man of Sen&s;e and Politene&s;s, who had been long in the World, and whom a Concur|rence of &s;trange Accidents had drove into a Cloi&s;ter. He did not endeavour to rea&s;on me out of my Grief, or to con&s;ole me by the u&s;ual Methods, he only expre&s;&s;ed great
<PB N="197" REF="198" MS="y">
Sen&s;ibility of my Misfortunes; this Way &s;ucceeded: by Degrees he entirely gained my Confidence, perhaps al&s;o I only wanted an Opportunity to &s;peak, and to complain to him. I conceived &s;o great an Affection and E&s;teem for him, that I related to him my whole Story. He became &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to me after a few Days Stay in the Convent, that I could not bear him to be ab&s;ent from me a Moment: I never met with a Man who had more real Goodne&s;s of Heart; I repeated to him the &s;ame Things a thou&s;and Times over, he always li&s;tened to me with the ut|mo&s;t Attention, and &s;ympathi&s;ed in all my Griefs.</P>
<P>It was through him that I learned every Thing that pa&s;&s;ed in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bena|vides.</HI></P>
<P>He had been much in danger from his Wound, but it was at length cured. I was informed of it by <HI>Don Jerome,</HI> &s;o was my Friend the Religious called. He afterwards told me that all &s;eemed quiet in the Ca&s;tle, that Madam <HI>de Benavides</HI> lived more retired than before, and that &s;he was in a very lan|gui&s;hing State of Health. He added, that I mu&s;t re&s;olve to remove as &s;oon as I was able, for if it &s;hould be di&s;covered that I was concealed there, it would expo&s;e Ma|dam <HI>de Benavides</HI> to new Di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="199">It was not likely that I &s;hould be &s;oon in a Condition to leave the Convent. I was wa&s;ting away with a continual Fever, and my Wound was not yet healed. I had been in this religious Hou&s;e above two Months, when one Day I ob&s;erved <HI>Don Jerome</HI> to be pen&s;ive and melancholly, he always turned his Eyes away when they met mine, he &s;eemed &s;tudiou&s;ly to avoid looking at me and with Difficulty an&s;wered my Que&s;tions. I had conceived a very tender Friend&s;hip for him: Misfortunes give Sen&s;ibility to the Heart. I was going to expre&s;s my Concern for his Unea&s;ine&s;s, and to enquire into the Cau&s;e, when <HI>Saint Laurent</HI> enter|ing my Chamber, told me that <HI>Don Gabriel</HI> was in the Convent, and that he had ju&s;t met him.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Don Gabriel</HI> here (&s;aid I looking at <HI>Don Jerome</HI>) and you never to mention to me his Coming! What is the meaning of this Re&s;erve? You fill me with the mo&s;t dreadful Apprehen&s;ions: what is become of Madam <HI>de Benavides?</HI> For Pity draw me out of this cruel Uncertainty.</Q></P>
<P>'Would I could leave you always in it!' (&s;aid <HI>Don Jerome</HI> at length embracing me.)</P>
<P><Q>Ah! (cried I) &s;he is dead, <HI>Adelaida</HI> is dead! <HI>Benavides</HI> has &s;acrificed her to his Rage! You an&s;wer me not &mdash; alas! then I have nothing to hope. Ah! it was not
<PB N="199" REF="200">
<HI>Benavides</HI> but I who have plunged the Poignard into her Brea&s;t, but for my fa|tal Pa&s;&s;ion &s;he might have been &s;till alive&mdash; <HI>Adelaida</HI> is dead, I &s;hall never behold her more &mdash; I have lo&s;t her for ever, &s;he is dead, and I &s;till live! Why do I not fol|low her, why do I delay to revenge her upon her Murderer? &mdash; Alas! Death would be too great an Indulgence to me, it would &s;eparate me from my&s;elf, and I am made up of Horror and Angui&s;h.</Q></P>
<P>The violent Agitation I was in cau&s;ed my Wound, which was not yet well healed, to open again. I lo&s;t &s;o much Blood that I fell into a Swoon, which la&s;ted &s;o long, that they thought me dead; but after continuing &s;everal Hours in this happy State of In&s;en|&s;ibility, I awoke to Grief unutterable.</P>
<P><HI>Don Jerome</HI> apprehen&s;ive that I &s;hould make an Attempt upon my own Life, charg|ed <HI>Saint Laurent</HI> to watch me with the &s;tricte&s;t Attention. My De&s;pair now took another Form: I complained not, I &s;hed not a Tear; then it was that I formed a Re&s;olution to go and inhabit &s;ome Solitude where I might, without Controul, deliver my&s;elf up a Prey to my Affliction.</P>
<P>I was de&s;irous of &s;eeing <HI>Don Gabriel,</HI> for I eagerly &s;ought every Thing that could heighten my De&s;pair. I intreated <HI>Don Je|rome</HI> to bring him, and the next Day they
<PB N="200" REF="201">
came together into my Chamber. <HI>Don Ga|briel</HI> &s;eated him&s;elf upon the Side of my Bed, we continued a long Time &s;ilent, neither of us were able to &s;peak: he looked upon me with Eyes &s;wimming in Tears.</P>
<P><Q>You are very generous, Mon&s;ieur (&s;aid I) at length to vi&s;it a Wretch whom you have &s;o much Rea&s;on to hate.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You are too mi&s;erable (replied he) to make it po&s;&s;ible for me to hate you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ah! (cried I) tell me, I be&s;eech you, every Circum&s;tance of my Misfortunes, leave me ignorant of nothing, the Expla|nation I de&s;ire of you may po&s;&s;ibly prevent my taking &s;ome Mea&s;ures which you have an Intere&s;t to hinder.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I &s;hall redouble your Affliction and my own (replied he) but I cannot help it:&mdash; I will &s;atisfy you, and in the Recital I am going to make you, you will find you are not the only Per&s;on to be pitied. Take then the Incidents in order as they hap|pened, we &s;hall too &s;oon come to the melancholly Cata&s;trophe.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I had never &s;een Madam <HI>de Benavides</HI> till &s;he became my Si&s;ter-in-law; my Brother, who had &s;ome Affairs of Con&s;e|quence to &s;ettle at <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> &s;aw her there and fell in love with her; and although he
<PB N="201" REF="202">
had &s;everal Rivals, who&s;e Birth and Riches were &s;uperior to his, yet Madam <HI>de Benavides,</HI> for Rea&s;ons I never could gue&s;s at, prefered him to them all: a &s;hort Time after their Marriage, he brought her to his E&s;tate in <HI>Bi&s;cay,</HI> there it was that I &s;aw her for the fir&s;t Time: if her Beauty excited my Admiration, I was &s;till more charmed with the Graces of her Mind, and the extreme Sweetne&s;s of her Temper, which my Brother put every Day to new Tryals. However the Pa&s;&s;ion I then had for a very amiable young Per&s;on, made me believe I was &s;ecured from the Influence of her Charms which it was impo&s;&s;ible to behold without Love: I even de&s;igned to make u&s;e of my Si&s;ter-in-law's Intere&s;t with my Brother, to prevail upon him to con&s;ent to our Marriage. The Father of my Mi&s;tre&s;s, offended at my Brother's Refu&s;al, had given me but a very &s;hort Time to bring him to a Compliance, declaring that when it was expired he would marry his Daughter to another.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Friend&s;hip and E&s;teem which Ma|dam <HI>de Benavides</HI> expre&s;&s;ed for me, gave me Courage to implore her A&s;&s;i&s;tance. I often went to her Apartment with an In|tention to &s;peak to her, but the &s;lighte&s;t Ob&s;tacle imaginable re&s;trained me: mean while the Time which had been pre&s;cribed to me drew towards a Period. I had re|ceived
<PB N="202" REF="203">
&s;everal Letters from my Mi&s;tre&s;s, in which &s;he pre&s;t me to u&s;e every Method to gain my Brother's Con&s;ent. My An|&s;wers did not &s;atisfy her: without my per|ceiving it, an Expre&s;&s;ion of Coldne&s;s ran through them which drew many Com|plaints from her, they appeared to me to be unju&s;t, and I reproached her with it. She now believed her&s;elf abandoned, and Re&s;entment joined to the Commands of her Father, determined her to marry the Per&s;on he propo&s;ed to her; &s;he her&s;elf in a Letter &s;he wrote to me informed me of her Marriage: &s;he reproached me but it was with Tenderne&s;s, and concluded with earne&s;tly intreating me never to &s;ee her more. I had loved her pa&s;&s;ionately, I imagined I &s;till loved her, and I could not learn that I had lo&s;t her for ever without feeling a real Affliction. I was afraid &s;he was unhappy, and I reproached my&s;elf with being the Cau&s;e of it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ab&s;orbed in the&s;e Reflections I conti|nued walking in a melancholly Manner in the little Wood which you u&s;ed often to vi&s;it: there I was met by Madam <HI>de Benavides,</HI> who ob&s;erving my Unea&s;ine&s;s, kindly de&s;ired to know the Cau&s;e of it. A &s;ecret Repugnance which I felt within my&s;elf, re&s;trained me from telling her. I could not re&s;olve to own to her that I had been in Love, but the Plea&s;ure of &s;peaking to her of that Pa&s;&s;ion carried it over that
<PB N="203" REF="204">
Con&s;ideration. All the&s;e Emotions pa&s;&s;ed in my Heart without my perceiving the Cau&s;e, as yet I had not dared to examine into the Nature of what I felt for my Si&s;ter-in-law. I related my Story to her, I &s;hewed her the Letter which <HI>I&s;abella</HI> had wrote to me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Why did you not mention this &s;ooner to me (&s;aid Madam <HI>de Benavides</HI>) perhaps I might have been able to obtain the Con|&s;ent of your Brother, tho' he refu&s;ed it to you. My God! how much I pity you, how greatly am I concerned for her: &s;he doubtle&s;s will be mi&s;erable.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Compa&s;&s;ion, which Madam <HI>de Be|navides</HI> expre&s;&s;ed for <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> made me apprehen&s;ive that &s;he would think hardly of me, as the Per&s;on who had made her unhappy. To dimini&s;h therefore this Compa&s;&s;ion, I eagerly told her that the Hu&s;band of <HI>I&s;abella</HI> was a Man of Birth and Merit, that he held a very con&s;ider|able Rank in the World, and that it was highly probable his Fortune would be &s;till more &s;o.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You are deceived (an&s;wered my lovely Si&s;ter-in-Law) if you think all the&s;e Ad|vantages can make her happy, nothing can make amends for the Lo&s;s of what one loves. It is a cruel Misfortune (add|ed &s;he) when one is obliged to act contrary
<PB N="204" REF="205">
to one's Inclination to comply with one's Duty.</Q></P>
<P><Q>She &s;ighed &s;everal Times during this Conver&s;ation, I even perceived that it was with Difficulty &s;he re&s;trained her Tears.</Q></P>
<P><Q>She left me &s;oon afterwards, I had not Power to follow her, I remained in a Trouble and Confu&s;ion I am not able to de&s;cribe. I now, for the fir&s;t Time, per|ceived what I had hitherto indu&s;triou&s;ly concealed from my&s;elf, that I was in love with my Si&s;ter-in-law, and I thought I could di&s;cover a &s;ecret Pa&s;&s;ion in her Heart. A thou&s;and Circum&s;tances then ru&s;hed up|on my Memory, which before I had given no Attention to, her Ta&s;te for Solitude, her Indifference for all tho&s;e Amu&s;ements which make the Delight of Per&s;ons of her Sex and Age, her extreme Melancholly, which I had attributed to my Brother's bad Treatment of her, now &s;eemed to me to proceed from another Cau&s;e. How many &s;ad Reflections now ro&s;e at one Time in my Mind, I found my&s;elf in love with a Per&s;on whom I ought not to love, and this Per&s;on's Heart in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If &s;he loved nothing (&s;aid I) my Pa&s;&s;ion, although without Hope, would not be without Sweetne&s;s: I might pretend to the Ble&s;&s;ing of her Friend&s;hip, in that I would
<PB N="205" REF="206">
place my Felicity. But this Friend&s;hip will not &s;atisfy my Heart, &s;ince &s;he has Sentiments more tender for another.&mdash; I was &s;en&s;ible I ought to u&s;e my utmo&s;t Endeavours to vanqui&s;h a Pa&s;&s;ion &s;o dan|gerous to my Quiet, and which Honour would not permit me to entertain. I took a Re&s;olution to fly from my too lovely Si&s;ter, and I returned to the Ca&s;tle to tell my Brother that &s;ome Affairs called me from him: but the Sight of Madam <HI>de Benavides</HI> left me no Power to follow the Dictates of my Rea&s;on, all my Re&s;olu|tions vani&s;hed into Air, yet to furni&s;h my|&s;elf with &s;ome Pretence to continue near her, I per&s;uaded my&s;elf that I was nece&s;|&s;ary to her, in being &s;ometimes able to calm the tempe&s;tuous Humours of her Hu&s;band.</Q></P>
<P><Q>About this Time you arrived. I found in your Air and Behaviour &s;omewhat greatly above the Condition you appeared in. I treated you with Familiarity and Kindne&s;s, I would have entered into your Confidence, and have made you my Friend, my Intention was to prevail upon you af|terwards to draw a Picture of Madam <HI>de Benavides</HI> for me, for notwith&s;tanding the delu&s;ive Rea&s;ons my Pa&s;&s;ion found for &s;taying with my Si&s;ter, yet I re&s;olved &s;ome Time or other to leave the Ca&s;tle. But in this Separation &s;o ju&s;t, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, I was willing at lea&s;t to have her Picture.
<PB N="206" REF="207">
The Manner in which you received the Advances I made you, &s;hewed me that I had nothing to hope for from you, and I was gone to bring another Painter into the Hou&s;e that unhappy Day when you wounded my Brother. Judge of my Sur|prize at my Return, when I was inform|ed of what had happened. My Brother, who was de&s;perately wounded, kept a gloomy Silence, ca&s;ting from Time to Time a terrible Look upon Madam <HI>de Benavides.</HI> As &s;oon as he &s;aw me he called me to his Bed-&s;ide.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Deliver me (&s;aid he) from the Sight of a Woman who has betrayed me, cau&s;e her to be conducted to her own Apartment, and give &s;trict Orders not to &s;uffer her to &s;tir out of it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I would have &s;aid &s;omething again&s;t this rigorous Order to my Brother, but he interrupted me at the fir&s;t Word.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Do as I de&s;ire you (&s;aid he) or never &s;ee me more.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I was obliged to obey, and approach|ing my Si&s;ter-in-Law I intreated her to let me &s;peak to her in her own Chamber.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Let us go, (&s;aid &s;he weeping) exe|cute the Orders you have received.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="208">
<Q>The&s;e Words, which had the Air of a Reproach, pierced me to the Soul. I dur&s;t not make her any An&s;wer in the Place we were then in; but no &s;ooner had I led her to her Chamber, than look|ing on her with that Grief and Tender|ne&s;s my Heart was full of,</Q></P>
<P><Q>What, Madam, (&s;aid I) do you con|found me with your Per&s;ecutor; I who feel your Trouble as &s;en&s;ibly as you do your&s;elf, I who would &s;acrifice my Life to &s;ave you? I grieve to &s;ay it, but I tremble for you. Retire for &s;ome Time to a Place of Safety, I will procure you to be conducted wherever you plea&s;e &s;o it is a &s;ecure A&s;ylum from your furious Hu&s;band.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I know not (&s;aid &s;he) whether Mon|&s;ieur <HI>de Benavides</HI> has any De&s;ign to take away my Life, but I know that it is my Duty not to abandon him, and I will fulfil it tho' I peri&s;h.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Then after a &s;hort Pau&s;e (&s;he added) I am going, by placing an entire Confi|dence in you, to give you the greate&s;t Mark of my E&s;teem it is in my Power to give, and indeed the Confe&s;&s;ion I have to make you is nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve yours for me. But go and attend your Brother, a longer Conver&s;ation may make you
<PB N="208" REF="209">
&s;u&s;pected by him. Return hither as &s;oon as you conveniently can.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I obeyed Madam <HI>de Benavides</HI> and went to my Brother's Apartment, the Surgeon had vi&s;ited him, and de&s;ired that no one might be allowed to come into his Chamber. I flew back again to his Wife, agitated with a thou&s;and different Thoughts. I was anxious to know what &s;he had to &s;ay to me, and yet I feared to hear it. She related to me the Manner in which &s;he became acquainted with you, the Pa&s;&s;ion you conceived for her the Mo|ment you &s;aw her, the generous Sacrifice you had made her, and &s;he did not con|ceal the Tenderne&s;s with which you had in&s;pired her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ah! (interrupted I) have I then been dear to the mo&s;t perfect Woman upon Earth, and have I lo&s;t her.</Q>
This Idea filled my Soul with &s;uch tender Sorrow, that my Tears, which had hitherto been re|&s;trained by the Exce&s;s of my De&s;pair, began now to &s;tream in great Abundance from my Eyes.</P>
<P><Q>Yes continued <HI>Dan Gabriel</HI> (with a Sigh) you were beloved. Good Heaven! what Tenderne&s;s did I not di&s;cover for you in her Heart, notwith&s;tanding her Misfortunes and the Horror of her pre&s;ent Situation. I perceived that &s;he indulged
<PB N="209" REF="210">
with Plea&s;ure the Thought, that her Ten|derne&s;s for you was authori&s;ed by what you had done for her. She confe&s;&s;ed to me that when I led her into the Chamber where you was painting, &s;he knew you, and that &s;he had wrote to you, to com|mand you to leave the Ca&s;tle, but that &s;he could not find an Opportunity to give you her Letter: &s;he afterwards related to me how her Hu&s;band &s;urpri&s;ed you together at the very Moment when you was bid|ding her an eternal Farewell; that he attempted to kill her, but you interpo&s;ed and wounded him in defending her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Save this unhappy Man (added &s;he) you only can pre&s;erve him from the Fate that waits him, for I know that in the Fear of expo&s;ing me to the lea&s;t Su&s;|picion, he will &s;uffer the mo&s;t cruel Death rather than declare who he is.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He is well rewarded for all he can &s;uffer, Madam (replied I) by the good Opinion you have of him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I have owned my Weakne&s;s to you (&s;aid &s;he) but you have &s;een that if I am not Mi&s;tre&s;s of my Affections, I have at lea&s;t been &s;o of my Conduct, and that I have taken no Step which the mo&s;t ri|gorous Virtue could condemn.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="211">
<Q>Alas! Madam, (interrupted I) it is not nece&s;&s;ary that you &s;hould conde&s;cend to ju&s;tify your&s;elf to me. Too well am I convinced by my own Experience that it is not always in one's Power to di&s;po&s;e of one's own Heart. I will u&s;e my utmo&s;t endeavours to obey you and to deliver the Count <HI>de Comminge:</HI> but oh! Madam, permit me to a&s;&s;ure you that I am more mi&s;erable than he is.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I left the Room as I pronounced the&s;e Words without daring to rai&s;e my Eyes to Madam <HI>de Benavides.</HI> I &s;hut my&s;elf up in my own Chamber to con&s;ider what I had to do. I had already taken a Re&s;olution to deliver you, but I was in doubt whether I ought not to fly from the Ca&s;tle my&s;elf. The Torments I had &s;uffered during the relation Madam <HI>de Benavides</HI> had made me, &s;hewed me the Exce&s;s of my Pa&s;&s;ion for her, it was nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould &s;uppre&s;s Sentiments &s;o dangerous to my Virtue, and in order to &s;uppre&s;s them, it was nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould &s;ee her no more; but it &s;eemed cruel to abandon her in &s;uch a di&s;tre&s;sful Situation, to leave her unprotected in the Hands of a Hu&s;band who believed him&s;elf wronged by her. After continuing long irre&s;olute, I determined at once to a&s;&s;i&s;t Madam <HI>de Bena|vides,</HI> and to avoid &s;eeing her as much as po&s;&s;ible. I could not inform her of your E&s;cape till the next Day: &s;he &s;eemed a little more ea&s;y on your Account, but I
<PB N="211" REF="212">
thought I could perceive that her Grief was increa&s;ed, and I doubted not but the De|claration I had made of my Sentiments was the Cau&s;e. I quitted her immediately in order to free her from the Embarra&s;&s;ment my Pre&s;ence threw her into.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I was &s;everal Days without &s;eeing her, my Brother grew wor&s;e and his Phy&s;icians thought him in great Danger. I was obliged to make her a Vi&s;it to acquaint her with this News.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If I had lo&s;t Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Benavides</HI> (&s;aid &s;he) in the ordinary Methods of Providence, his Death would have le&s;s &s;en&s;ibly affected me, but the Part I have unfortunately had in it, makes it an in|&s;upportable Affliction to me. I am not apprehen&s;ive of the ill Treatment I may meet with from him, I am only afraid of his dying in a Per&s;ua&s;ion that I have wronged him. If he lives I may hope that he will be one Day convinced of my Innocence, and re&s;tore me to his E&s;teem.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Suffer me, Madam, (&s;aid I) to endea|vour to merit yours. I implore your Pardon for tho&s;e Sentiments I have dared to let you perceive. I was not able to pre|vent their Birth, or to conceal them from you. I even know not whether I can &s;ubdue them; but I &s;wear to you, that I
<PB N="212" REF="213">
will never importune you with them. I had taken a Re&s;olution to fly far from you, but your Intere&s;t retains me here.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I confe&s;s to you (replied Madam <HI>de Be|navides</HI>) that you have given me great Unea&s;ine&s;s: Fortune &s;eemed de&s;irous of taking from me the Con&s;olation I have found in your Friend&s;hip.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Tears &s;he &s;hed while &s;he &s;poke to me were more powerful than all the Efforts of my Rea&s;on. I was a&s;hamed of having augmented the Mi&s;eries of one already &s;o unhappy.</Q></P>
<P><Q>No Madam, (replied I) you &s;hall never be deprived of that Friend&s;hip you have the Goodne&s;s to &s;et &s;ome Value upon, and I will endeavour to render my&s;elf worthy of yours, by my Solicitude to make you forget the Extravagance I have been guilty of.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In Effect, when I left her I found my|&s;elf more calm and ea&s;y, than I had ever been &s;ince I fir&s;t beheld her. Far from leaving her, I endeavoured by the Re&s;o|lutions I vowed to take when in her Pre|&s;ence to furni&s;h my&s;elf with new Arguments for performing my Duty. This Method &s;ucceeded: I accu&s;tomed my&s;elf by Degrees to reduce my former Sentiments to Friend|&s;hip and E&s;teem, I told her ingenuou&s;ly the
<PB N="213" REF="214">
Progre&s;s I made in my Cure, &s;he thanked me for it, as for &s;ome con&s;iderable &s;ervice I had rendered her; and to reward me gave me every Day new Marks of her Confi|dence. Still my Heart would &s;ometimes revolt, but Rea&s;on always got the Victory.</Q></P>
<P><Q>My Brother after langui&s;hing a long Time at length began to recover: he would never be prevailed upon to give his Wife permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ee him tho' &s;he often reque&s;ted it. He was not yet in a Condition to leave his Chamber, when Madam <HI>de Be|navides</HI> fell ill in her turn. Her Youth &s;aved her this Time, and I was full of hope that her Illne&s;s had &s;oftened her Hu&s;|band's Heart, for although he had continued ob&s;tinately re&s;olute not to &s;ee her during his own Danger notwith&s;tanding her earne&s;t intreaties yet he &s;hewed &s;ome &s;olicitude in enquiring for her when &s;he was ill.</Q></P>
<P><Q>She was almo&s;t recovered when my Brother ordered me to be called to him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I have &s;ome important Bu&s;ine&s;s (&s;aid he) which demands my Pre&s;ence in <HI>Sara|go&s;&s;a.</HI> My Health will not permit me to take this Journey, I mu&s;t intreat you therefore to go in my &s;tead. I have or|dered my Equipage to be got ready and you will oblige me by &s;etting out imme|diately.</Q>
The Marquis <HI>de Benavides</HI> is older
<Q><PB N="214" REF="215">than by a great Number of Years. I have always had the &s;ame Re&s;pect for him, as for a Father. And he has held the Place of one to me. Be&s;ides I had no Rea&s;on to urge which could di&s;pen&s;e with my doing as he de&s;ired. I was obliged therefore to re&s;olve to go, but I thought this ready Compliance gave me a Right to &s;peak to him in Favour of Madam <HI>de Benavides.</HI> What did I not &s;ay to &s;often him! he appeared to me to be &s;haken, I even fancied I &s;aw Tears in his Eyes.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I have loved Madam <HI>de Benavides</HI> (&s;aid he to me) with the mo&s;t ardent Pa&s;&s;ion, it is not yet extingui&s;hed in my Heart; but Time and her future Conduct can only efface the Remembrance of what I have &s;een.</Q>
I dur&s;t not enter into any Di&s;|cour&s;e
<Q>with him, concerning the Cau&s;e of his Complaints, that would have again recalled his former Rage, I only de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to acquaint my Si&s;ter-in-law with the Hopes he had given me. He granted my Reque&s;t: this poor Lady re|ceived the News I brought her with a kind of Joy.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I know (&s;aid &s;he) that I can never be happy with Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Benavides,</HI> but I &s;hall at lea&s;t have the Con&s;olation of being where my Duty calls me.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="216">
<Q>After having again a&s;&s;ured her of my Brother's good Di&s;po&s;ition to her, I took my Leave of her. One of the chief Do|me&s;tics in the Hou&s;e, in whom I confided, had promi&s;ed to be &s;trictly attentive to every Thing that regarded her, and to give me Information.</Q></P>
<P><Q>After the&s;e Precautions which I thought &s;ufficient, I &s;et out for <HI>Sarago&s;&s;a.</HI> I had been there fifteen Days without having any News from the Ca&s;tle, and was be|ginning to be very unea&s;y at this long Si|lence, when I received a Letter from the faithful Dome&s;tic I mentioned. He in|formed me that three Days after my De|parture, Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Benavides</HI> had di&s;|charged him and all the re&s;t of his Ser|vants, except one Man whom he named to me, and the Wife of that Man.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I trembled as I read this Letter, and without troubling my&s;elf any farther about the Bu&s;ine&s;s with which I was charged, I hired Po&s;t Hor&s;es to return to the Ca&s;tle.</Q></P>
<P><Q>When I was within a Day's Journey of this Place, I received the fatal News of the Death of Madam <HI>de Benavides.</HI> My Brother who wrote to me him&s;elf, ap|peared &s;o greatly afflicted, that I could not &s;uppo&s;e he had been acce&s;&s;ary to it. He told me the great Love he had for his Wife had &s;ubdued his Re&s;entment, and
<PB N="216" REF="217">
that he was ready to pardon her when Death &s;natched her from him. That &s;he had relap&s;ed a &s;hort Time after my De|parture, and her Fever encrea&s;ing &s;he died upon the fifteenth Day of her Illne&s;s. Since I came hither to &s;eek &s;ome Con&s;o|lation in the Company of <HI>Don Jerome,</HI> I have been informed that my Brother is plunged in the deepe&s;t Sadne&s;s, that he &s;ees no one, and he has even intreated me to defer &s;eeing him for &s;ome Time.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I find no Difficulty in complying with his Reque&s;t (continued <HI>Don Gabriel</HI>) tho&s;e Places in which I have &s;een the unfortunate Madam <HI>de Benavides,</HI> and where I &s;hall no more &s;ee her, would encrea&s;e my Grief: her Death &s;eems to have awaken|ed all my former Sentiments, and I know not whether the Tears I &s;hed, do not more proceed from Love than Friend&s;hip. I have determined to go into <HI>Hungary,</HI> where I hope either to find Death in the War, or to recover the Peace I have lo&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>Here <HI>Don Gabriel</HI> cea&s;ed to &s;peak. I was not able to an&s;wer him, but with Tears, my Voice was lo&s;t in Sighs; <HI>Don Gabriel</HI> al&s;o wept bitterly, at length he left me with|out my being able to utter a &s;ingle Word. <HI>Don Jerome</HI> attended him out, and I was left alone: the melancholly Relation I had ju&s;t heard, increa&s;ed my Impatience to &s;ee my&s;elf in a Place where I might abandon
<PB N="217" REF="218">
my&s;elf without Interuption to the Exce&s;s of my Grief. The De&s;ire of executing this Scheme ha&s;tened my Cure, after having been long in a langui&s;hing Condition my Wound was healed, my Strength returned, and I found my&s;elf able in a little Time to leave the Convent.</P>
<P>The Parting between <HI>Don Jerome</HI> and I, was on his &s;ide full of Tenderne&s;s and friendly Concern, but the Lo&s;s of <HI>Adelaida</HI> had left me in&s;en&s;ible to all other Impre&s;|&s;ions. I would not acquaint him with my De&s;ign le&s;t he &s;hould endeavour to oppo&s;e it, I wrote to my Mother and &s;ent my Let|ter by <HI>Saint-Laurent,</HI> making him believe that I would wait for an An&s;wer, in the Place I then was. This Letter contained an Account of all that had happened to me &s;ince I &s;aw her la&s;t; I earne&s;tly a&s;ked her Pardon for leaving her as I re&s;olved to do for ever, I added that in Tenderne&s;s to her paternal Affection, I cho&s;e to &s;pare her the Sight of a mi&s;erable Wretch who had now nothing left to wi&s;h for, but Death. And la&s;tly I conjured her not to make any At|tempts to di&s;cover the Place of my Re|treat, and recommended the faithful <HI>Saint-Laurent</HI> to her Protection.</P>
<P>When I parted with him I gave him all the Money I had about me, re&s;erving only what was &s;ufficient to an&s;wer my Expences during my Journey. The Letter I had received
<PB N="218" REF="219">
from Madam <HI>de Benavides,</HI> and her Picture which I wore next my Heart, was all the Wealth I was po&s;&s;e&s;t of: I travelled with an Impatience which hardly allowed me to &s;top a few Moments, to the Abbey <HI>de la T</HI> . . . . . Upon my Arrival I demanded the Habit of the Order. The Father Ab|bot obliged me to undergo the Probationary Forms, and when they where fini&s;hed, a&s;ked me whether the wretched Diet and other Au&s;terities did not appear more than equal to my Strength. Ab&s;orbed in Grief I had not even perceived the Difference of my Diet, and the Au&s;terities he mentioned: my In&s;en&s;ibility was taken for a Mark of Zeal, and I was received.</P>
<P>The Certainty I now had that my Tears might flow uninterrupted, and that I might pa&s;s my whole Life in this &s;ad Employment, gave me &s;ome Kind of Con&s;olation; the horrid Solitude, the melancholy Silence, that reigned in this Cloi&s;ter, the mortified Coun|tenances of all about me, left me wholly devoted to that Grief, which was become &s;o precious to me, that it &s;upplied the Place of all I had lo&s;t. I performed all the Exer|ci&s;es of the Cloi&s;ter without thinking of their Severity, for every Thing was alike indifferent to me. I went every Day into the thicke&s;t Part of the Wood, there would I read over the Letter, and gaze on the Pic|ture of my dear <HI>Adelaida,</HI> bathe them both with my Tears, and replacing them upon
<PB N="219" REF="220">
my Heart, return with greater Weight of Grief.</P>
<P>Three Years I led this melancholy Life, while Time neither alleviated my Sorrow, nor brought the Period to it, which I &s;o ear|ne&s;tly de&s;ired, when one Morning I was &s;ummoned by the Tolling of the Bell to be pre&s;ent at the Death of one of the Religious. He was already laid upon the A&s;hes, the la&s;t Sacrament was going to be admini&s;tred to him, when he de&s;ired to &s;peak to the Fa|ther Abbot.</P>
<P><Q>What I am going to &s;ay Father (&s;aid the dying Penitent) will animate with new Fervor all who &s;hall hear me, &s;ince by Methods &s;o extraordinary I have been drawn out of the Aby&s;s of Sin and Mi|&s;ery into which I was plunged, and conducted to the Port of Salvation. I am unworthy of the Name of Brother, with which the&s;e holy Religious have honoured me; in me you behold an un|happy Woman whom a profane Pa&s;&s;ion has led to this &s;anctified Place. I loved and was beloved by a young Man of a Rank equal to my own; the mutual Ha|tred of our Fathers put a Bar to our Marriage; I was even obliged for the In|tere&s;t of my Lover to give my Hand to another Per&s;on, and in the Choice of my Hu&s;band, I endeavoured &s;till to give him Proofs of the Continuance of my Pa&s;&s;ion.
<PB N="220" REF="221">
The Man who could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to in&s;pite me with any Sentiments but tho&s;e of Hatred and Contempt, was preferred to every other who addre&s;t me; becau&s;e, the Sacrifice I made him &s;hould be compleat, and that he might have no Cau&s;e for Jealou&s;y. The Almighty decreed that a Marriage contracted with &s;uch criminal Views &s;hould prove a Source of Mi&s;ery to me. Although I never after would con&s;ent to &s;ee my Lover, yet my Hu&s;|band and he met and wounded each other before my Eyes: Terror and Grief threw me into a violent Illne&s;s; I was &s;carcely recovered, when my Hu&s;band &s;hut me up in a private Apartment of his Ca&s;tle, and cau&s;ed it to be reported that I was dead. I continued two Years in that melancholy Confinement, with no other Con&s;olation than what the Compa&s;&s;ion of her who daily brought me my Food af|forded me. My Hu&s;band not &s;atisfied with the Mi&s;eries he inflicted on me, had the Cruelty to in&s;ult me under them. Oh! my God (what do I &s;ay) dare I ac|cu&s;e of Cruelty the In&s;trument thou wa&s;t plea&s;ed to make u&s;e of for my Puni&s;hment? The&s;e Afflictions did not bring me to a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of the Extravagancies of my Conduct. In&s;tead of weeping for my Faults, I wept only for my Lover. The Death of my Hu&s;band &s;et me at Liberty. The Woman who had &s;erved me, being the only Per&s;on who knew the Truth of
<PB N="221" REF="222">
my Condition, came to open the Doors of my Pri&s;on and informed me that I had pa&s;&s;ed for dead from the Moment I entered it. Not doubting but the Treatment I had met with from my Hu&s;|band had given Ri&s;e to very unfavourable Su&s;picions of my Virtue, I deliberated whether it was not nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould pa&s;s the Re&s;t of my Days in a Convent; and I was confirmed in this De&s;ign when I learned that the only Per&s;on who could retain me in the World had not been heard of for a long Time. I di&s;gui&s;ed my&s;elf in the Habit of a Man that I might leave the Ca&s;tle without being known. The Convent to which I re|&s;olved to retire, was that in which I had been educated, and is but a few Leagues di&s;tant from hence. I was travelling to it, when the Solitarine&s;s of this Place &s;triking my Imagination as I pa&s;&s;ed by, I alighted from my Chai&s;e in order to in|dulge my &s;ad Reflections a few Moments. A &s;ecret Impul&s;e, which I could not re|&s;i&s;t, led me in to your Chapel, &s;carce had I entered, when among the Voices that &s;ung the Prai&s;es of our Lord, I di&s;tingui&s;hed one too well accu&s;tomed to reach my Heart; I thought at fir&s;t that my di&s;or|dered Imagination had deceived me by a fancied Re&s;emblance, but when I ap|proached, notwith&s;tanding the Alteration which Time, Grief, and the Au&s;terities of a Cloi&s;ter had made in his Counte|nance,
<PB N="222" REF="223">
I immediately knew that Sedu|cer, &s;o dear to my Remembrance. Great God! what became of me at this Sight, what were the cruel Agitations of my Mind? Far from prai&s;ing the Almighty for calling him to &s;o holy a Profe&s;&s;ion. I bla&s;phemed again&s;t him for having de|prived me of him; you puni&s;hed not my impious Murmurs, oh! my God, and you made u&s;e of my own Folly and Mi&s;ery to draw me to your&s;elf. I was not able to leave a Place which inclo&s;ed what I loved, and in order that we might no more be &s;eparated, I di&s;charged my Guide and pre&s;ented my&s;elf, Father, to you. Deceived by the Eagerne&s;s I di&s;covered to be admitted into your Cloi&s;ter, you received me willingly. Alas! what was the Di&s;po&s;itions which I brought to your holy Exerci&s;es, a Heart filled with a pro|fane. Pa&s;&s;ion, and every Thought em|ployed on the dear Object of its Tender|ne&s;s. The Almighty who by abandoning me to my wild Affections would give me greater Cau&s;e for humbling my&s;elf one Day before him, doubtle&s;s permitted tho&s;e empoi&s;oned delights which I ta&s;ted in breathing the &s;ame Air, and living in the &s;ame Hou&s;e with him I loved. I fol|lowed him every where, I a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in his Labours as much as my Strength would allow, and in tho&s;e Moments I thought my&s;elf over-paid for all that I had &s;uffered, but yet my imprudent Ten|derne&s;s

did not carry me &s;o far as to make my&s;elf known to him. But what was the Motive that hindered me? The Fear of di&s;turbing the Quiet of him for whom I had lo&s;t my own. But for this fear I &s;hould perhaps have attempted to &s;natch from God a Soul which I believed wholly devoted to him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Two Months are now clap&s;ed, &s;ince, in Obedience to a Regulation of our holy Founder, who was de&s;irous by a conti|nual Idea of Death, to &s;anctify the Lives of his Religious, we have been obliged each to dig his own Grave. I fol|lowed as u&s;ual him to whom I was at|tached by Ties &s;o &s;hameful. The Sight of his Grave, the Ardor with which he dug it, pierced my Heart with &s;uch an Exce&s;s of Sorrow, that I was obliged to leave him and retire to the mo&s;t unfrequented Part of the Wood to give free Cour&s;e to my Tears. From that Moment I was in continual Apprehen&s;ions of lo&s;ing him, the Idea of his Death was ever pre&s;ent to my Mind, my Tender|ne&s;s increa&s;ed every Day. I followed him every where, and if I was &s;ome Hours in a Day without &s;eeing him, I thought I &s;hould never &s;ee him more.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But now the Happy Moment arrived when God was plea&s;ed to draw me to him&s;elf, I went with the Man my Soul
<PB N="224" REF="225">
&s;o fondly loved, into the Fore&s;t to cut Wood for the U&s;es of the Hou&s;e; after &s;ome Time &s;pent in this Employment, I perceived that my Companion had left me; anxious and unea&s;y at his Ab&s;ence, I could not help going to &s;eek for him: after having wandered through great Part of the Fore&s;t, I &s;aw him at length in one of the mo&s;t retired Parts of it, employed in gazing earne&s;tly upon &s;omething he had taken from his Bo&s;om; he was in &s;o pro|found a Revery, that I came up clo&s;e to him, and had Lei&s;ure to look upon what he held in his Hand without his perceiving me, how great was my A&s;toni&s;hment when I &s;aw it was my own Picture. I was now &s;en&s;ible that far from enjoying that Quiet I was &s;o unwilling to interrupt, he was like me the mi&s;erable Victim of a cri|minal Pa&s;&s;ion: I &s;aw the Powerful Hand of God ready to fall upon him; that fatal Pa&s;&s;ion which I had carried with me even to the Feet of his Altars, &s;eemed to have drawn the Vengeance of Heaven upon him who was the Object of it. Full of this terrifying Idea I came to pro&s;trate my&s;elf before tho&s;e Altars, I implored of God my own Conver&s;ion in Order to obtain that of my Lover. Yes, oh! my God, it was for him that I offered up my Sup|plications to thee, for him I &s;hed Tears of Remor&s;e and Grief, it was the Con&s;i|deration of his Intere&s;t that brought me to thee. Thou had&s;t Compa&s;&s;ion upon my
<PB N="225" REF="226">
Weakne&s;s, my Prayer, prophane as it was, thou did&s;t not reject; my Heart be|came &s;en&s;ible of the healing Power of thy Grace; from that bli&s;sful Moment I experienced the Peace of a Soul which is with thee, and de&s;ires only thee. Thou wa&s;t plea&s;ed to purify me by &s;ufferings: I was &s;eized with Sickne&s;s &s;oon after. If the Partner of my wild Affections &s;till groans under the Weight of his profane Pa&s;&s;ion, let him ca&s;t his Eyes upon me, let him View the Wretch whom he has &s;o madly loved, let him reflect upon that tremendous Moment to which I am now arrived, and to which he &s;hall &s;hortly arrive, oh! let him &s;eek God e'er he has &s;ilenced his Mercy to li&s;ten only to his Ju&s;tice. But I feel the Time of my la&s;t Sacrifice approaching: I be&s;eech the&s;e holy Religious to offer up their Prayers for my departing Soul; I humbly intreat their Pardon for the Offence I have given them, and I acknowledge my&s;elf unworthy to partake of their Sepulchre.</Q></P>
<P>The found of that adored Voice, now un|di&s;gui&s;ed, and always pre&s;ent to my Remem|brance, made me know <HI>Adelaida</HI> at the fir&s;t Words &s;he pronounced. What Lan|guage can convey an Idea of what I then felt? All that the mo&s;t ardent Love, all that the tendere&s;t Compa&s;&s;ion, all that the mo&s;t poignant Grief, and wilde&s;t De&s;pair could in&s;pire tore my di&s;tracted Soul that Moment.
<PB N="226" REF="227">
I was pro&s;trate on the Ground like the other Religious, while &s;he was &s;peaking, the Fear of lo&s;ing any one of her Words re|&s;trained my Cries, but when I found that in uttering the La&s;t &s;he had expired; the Hou&s;e ecchoed with my agonizing Shrieks.</P>
<P>The Religious running to me, rai&s;ed me from the Ground, I tore my&s;elf out of their Arms, I flew to the Corps of <HI>Adelaida,</HI> and kneeling down be&s;ide it, I bathed one of her lifele&s;s Hands with my Tears.</P>
<P><Q>I have lo&s;t you then a &s;econd Time my dear <HI>Adelaida</HI> (cried I) and I have lo&s;t you for ever, what! have you been &s;o long with me and did not my ungrateful Heart acknowledge you? but we will ne|ver more be &s;eparated: Death, added I, folding her in my Arms, Death, le&s;s cruel than my inexorable Father, &s;hall now, in &s;pite of him, unite us for ever.</Q></P>
<P>True piety is never &s;evere, the Father Ab|bot, moved at this Sight endeavoured by the tendere&s;t Condolances, and the mo&s;t holy Exhortations to &s;often my Grief, and prevail upon me to abandon the Corps of <HI>Adelaida</HI> which I held fa&s;t locked in my Arms; find|ing me deaf to all he could urge, he was obliged to u&s;e force, they dragged me from the lovely Body into my own Cell whither the Father Abbot followed me, he &s;taid with me the whole Night, vainly attempting to

calm my Mind, my De&s;pair was increa&s;ed by the Con&s;olations he offered me.</P>
<P><Q>Give me <HI>Adelaida,</HI> (&s;aid I) why have you &s;eparated us? Suffer me to die be&s;ide her. Oh! why did not my Soul take its Flight with hers. Alas! I can live no longer in a Place where I have lo&s;t her, and where &s;he &s;uffered &s;o many Mi&s;eries. Permit me (added I) throwing my&s;elf at his Feet, permit me to leave this Cloi&s;ter, what will you do with a mi&s;erable Wretch who&s;e De&s;pair will trouble your Repo&s;e? &s;uffer me to retire to &s;ome other Solitude, there to wait for a final End to all my Sorrows. My dear <HI>Adelaida</HI> will obtain of God that my Penitence and Prayers may be effectual for my Salvation. And oh!

<P>The Father Abbot moved with Compa&s;|&s;ion for my Misfortunes, and perhaps de&s;i|rous of removing from the Eyes of his Re|ligious, an Object which gave &s;o much &s;can|dal to their Piety, granted my Reque&s;t, and promi&s;ed to do what I de&s;ired.

<P><PB N="228" REF="229">The Count of <HI>Comminge</HI> here concluded his affecting Narration, and retired in ha&s;te to indulge a Grief which the me|lancholy Ideas his Story had recalled to his Remembrance, made too violent to be longer re&s;trained.</P>
<P>The Chevalier who&s;e generous Heart was &s;en&s;ibly moved at the &s;ad Recital of &s;o many cruel Misfortunes, &s;at ruminating a long Time upon what he had heard; he admired the un&s;haken Fidelity of <HI>Adelaida,</HI> and comparing her Tenderne&s;s and truth with the capricious Behaviour of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> he thence drew Arguments to &s;trength|en his Re&s;entment, and to confirm his Re|&s;olution of quitting her for ever. He now became &s;o fond of the noble Solitary, that he eagerly watched every Opportunity of conver&s;ing with him. He entered &s;o deeply into his Affliction, &s;o pathetically lamented his Misfortunes, and &s;poke of <HI>Adelaida</HI> with &s;o much Reverence and Admiration, that the melancholy Count found a kind of Sweet|ne&s;s in his Society which he had been long a Stranger to.</P>
<P>The Chevalier knowing how dear the Mention of <HI>Adelaida</HI> was to him, always introduced the &s;adly plea&s;ing Theme; he would &s;it whole Hours and li&s;ten to his ten|der Comulaints, and while he de&s;cribed the Birth and Progre&s;s of his Pa&s;&s;ion, his Di&s;ap|pointments, his Sufferings and his De&s;pair,
<PB N="229" REF="230">
he would &s;igh &s;ympathetically, dwell on the mo&s;t affecting Circum&s;tances of his Story, and &s;ometimes lament the Cruelty of his Fate, with &s;o much Pa&s;&s;ion, as &s;hewed his Heart had the deepe&s;t Sen&s;e of his Mis|fortunes. Nothing could be more &s;oothing to the unfortunate Count than this Con|duct, but it was very dangerous to the Quiet of the Chevalier; by &s;uch &s;oftening Conver&s;ations he indulged Ideas which in the Re&s;olution he had taken to quit the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> for ever, it was his Bu|&s;ine&s;s to bani&s;h as much as po&s;&s;ible from his Mind. His Imagination now repre&s;ented her to him with all tho&s;e re&s;i&s;tle&s;s Graces which fir&s;t captivated his Affection, a thou&s;and tender Pa&s;&s;ages ru&s;hed back upon his Remembrance; with mingled Pain and Plea&s;ure he reflected on the Time when fir&s;t her Gratitude for the Services he had done her, forced from her an Acknowledgment of her Love; he thought on tho&s;e happy Days when &s;he was under his Protection at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> and when all Ob&s;tacles being re|moved he was at Liberty to avow his Pa&s;&s;ion, and was ble&s;t with a Declaration that &s;he would be his. When once the&s;e Thoughts found free Admittance into his Mind, he gave him&s;elf wholly up to their &s;oftening Influence: he no longer beheld Ma|dam <HI>de Berci</HI> fal&s;e, proud, and ungrateful, but tender, pa&s;&s;ionate, con&s;tant, &s;uch as he wi&s;hed, &s;uch as he fain would believe her to be; he &s;ought for Pretences to excu&s;e her Con|duct
<PB N="230" REF="231">
and to blame his own. In all Love-Quarrels the Tran&s;ition from fancied Hate or Indifference, to Fondne&s;s and De&s;ire, is extremely &s;udden and violent. The Che|valier had no &s;ooner cheated him&s;elf into a Per&s;ua&s;ion that he had injured his Mi&s;tre&s;s by his unju&s;t Su&s;picions, than he was eager to go and throw him&s;elf at her Feet, but he was re&s;trained by the Fear of her Re&s;ent|ment for the cruel Letter he had wrote to her, and his voluntary Bani&s;hment from her Sight; anxious and impatient, yet timid and irre&s;olute he wore away his Days. He no longer courted the Conver&s;ation of the me|lancholy Solitary, but was wholly ab&s;orbed in Reflections on his pa&s;t Happine&s;s, when the Counte&s;s and he convinced of each other's Tenderne&s;s and Fidelity, &s;uffered no doubt to &s;adden their bli&s;sful Pro&s;pect of being united for ever. He &s;ought out the thicke&s;t Rece&s;&s;es of the Wood, and there laid at the Foot of &s;ome over-grown Oak, he fed his Pa&s;&s;ion with delightful Hopes, while he for|bore to &s;eek the Certainty, for Fear of lo&s;ing the &s;weet Delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>But now the Approaches of a Rude and chearle&s;s Winter, began to le&s;&s;en his Ta&s;te for Solitude and Silence. The Trees had lo&s;t their refre&s;hing Shade, the Earth its beautiful Verdure, no more the &s;weet Harmony of the Birds exhilirated his Spirits, the gently da&s;hing Stream no more by its Murmurs &s;oothed his plea&s;ing
<PB N="231" REF="232">
Melancholy. All Nature &s;eemed to wear a Face of Sadne&s;s, and the altered Pro&s;pect now rai&s;ed only gloomy Ideas in his Mind; his Rage and Indignation turned wholly upon him&s;elf, he cur&s;ed his Pride, his Folly and his Ob&s;tinacy, the Former for having &s;o readily &s;ugge&s;ted Notions of his being injured and affronted by Madam <HI>de Berci,</HI> and the Latter for making him &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly adhere to his mad Re&s;olution of never &s;eeing her more.</P>
<P>The De&s;ign of Returning to <HI>Paris</HI> was as eagerly formed and as quickly execut|ed as that of leaving it had been before. He took a tender Leave of the unhappy Count <HI>de Comminge,</HI> and providing him&s;elf with a Hor&s;e and a Di&s;gui&s;e in the next Village, he &s;et out for that City, with an im|patience that never &s;uffered him to &s;top till he reached the Gates of it.</P>
<P>It was late at Night, which, together with his Di&s;gui&s;e, &s;ecured him from being known; he alighted at the Hou&s;e of his faithful Friend Mon&s;ieur <HI>la Ronvere:</HI> &s;carce would he give him, leave to expre&s;s his Joy at &s;eeing him again whom all <HI>Paris</HI> had believed to be dead when he eagerly enquired after the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> a&s;king him a hundred Que&s;tions in a Breath. Mon|&s;ieur <HI>la Ronvere</HI> gave him a particular Ac|count of all that had happened to Madam <HI>de Berci,</HI> &s;ince he left <HI>Paris,</HI> her Grief, her
<PB N="232" REF="233">
Illne&s;s, and the pre&s;ent langui&s;hing State of her Body and Mind.</P>
<P>The Chevalier &s;ighed often while his Friend was &s;peaking, a Tear &s;ometimes &s;tole from his Eyes, yet the Emotions he felt had more of Plea&s;ure than Pain in them. He attributed that Grief, that Ill|ne&s;s, and her pre&s;ent Melancholy, to her Regret for the Unju&s;tice &s;he had done him, and her Fears of having lo&s;t him for ever. The Idea of being &s;till dear to the Woman whom he adored, and who&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed Incon&s;tancy had given him &s;o many Pangs, filled him with a Tran|&s;port which even the Account his Friend gave him of the weak State &s;he was in could not allay. Not doubting but his re|turn, and his renewed Tenderne&s;s would re&s;tore her to Peace and Health, his Heart exulting in the Proofs &s;he had given of her Love for him, would admit no anxious Fears to di&s;turb his pre&s;ent Happine&s;s; he even re&s;olved to let her remain in Ignorance of his Fate, till he had indulged him&s;elf with a Sight of the melancholy Fair one. Unperceived by him&s;elf, &s;ome Remains of Jealou&s;y and Di&s;tru&s;t lay dormant in his Brea&s;t; the Delicacy of his Love could not be &s;atisfied with a le&s;s certain Te&s;timony of her Grief, than what his own Ob&s;erva|tion could give him; he fancied to him&s;elf a thou&s;and &s;ecret Plea&s;ures in contemplating that lovely Face, over&s;pread with tender Sor|row
<PB N="233" REF="234">
on his Account, and reading in her &s;weet expre&s;&s;ive Eyes, the dear Inquietude of her Heart.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>la Ronvere</HI> who expected to have found him impatient to throw him|&s;elf at the Feet of the mourning Counte&s;s, was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee him &s;it &s;ilent and ab|&s;orbed in thought.
<Q>Surely (&s;aid he &s;mil|ing) it is not nece&s;&s;ary to remind you that your Mi&s;tre&s;s is in <HI>Paris.</HI></Q>
The Che|valier rou&s;ed from his plea&s;ing Revery, told his Friend that he was re&s;olved to remain concealed a few Days, that he might have an Oppertunity of &s;eeing the Counte&s;s without her knowing him; the Rea&s;ons he gave for this De&s;ign appeared very whim&s;i|cal to Mon&s;ieur <HI>la Ronvere,</HI> who had no No|tion of tho&s;e Refinements which make up the chief Bli&s;s as well as Pains of Lovers. He tried to rea&s;on the Chevalier out of this wild Curio&s;ity, but finding his Arguments would not prevail, he alledged the Impo&s;&s;ibility of gratifying it, &s;ince the Counte&s;s hardly ever came abroad.</P>
<P>The Chevalier had been u&s;ed to con|quer Difficulties, nor was he &s;orry to hear that it was not an ea&s;y Matter to &s;ee his Mi&s;tre&s;s. He di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf in a tat|tered Coat, hid part of his Face with a large black Patch, turned up his Hair under a Wig of a different Colour, and thus me|tarmopho&s;ed took his Way to the Street
<PB N="234" REF="235">
where Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> re&s;ided, having fir&s;t obliged his Friend to promi&s;e that he would keep his Secret faithfully.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t he could hope for, or indeed de&s;ired, was a tran&s;ient View of his Mi&s;tre&s;s from the Windows of her Apartment, but he had &s;pent &s;everal Days in pa&s;&s;ing backwards and forwards thro' the Street without obtain|ing that Satisfaction. Mon&s;ieur <HI>la Ronvere</HI> did not fail to divert him&s;elf with every new Di&s;apointment, often urging him, tho' in vain, to lay a&s;ide his ridiculous Enterpri&s;e.</P>
<P>Mean Time the Family <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> were making Preparations for the Nuptials of Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt</HI> and the young Count of <HI>Berci.</HI> The fair Amazon having by a generous Effort of her Rea&s;on conquered her Pa&s;&s;ion for the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> li&s;tened favourably to the Vows of the Count of <HI>Berci,</HI> who offered her a Heart which had never acknowledged any Power but hers. She had contracted a &s;trict Friend&s;hip with the young Marchione&s;s <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> and Madam <HI>de Berci,</HI> and was therefore plea&s;ed with an Allyance which made her &s;tand in &s;ome Degree of Relation to them.</P>
<P>The King who&s;e Admiration and E&s;teem of Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt</HI> increa&s;ed with the Knowledge of her aimiable Qua|lities, did her the Honour to &s;ign her Con|tract of Marriage and promi&s;ed to grace
<PB N="235" REF="236">
the Solemnity with his Pre&s;ence; and to do Honour to the Nuptials of a Lady who had &s;ignali&s;ed her&s;elf in Arms, he decreed a &s;olemn Turnament to be held, the Prize, which was a Jewel of great Value, was to be be|&s;towed by her Maje&s;ty upon the Cavalier whom Skill or Fortune &s;hould mo&s;t Favour in the Field.</P>
<P>If any Thing would have relieved that Me|lancholy into which the Chevalier's Ab&s;ence had plunged Madam <HI>de Berci,</HI> the Marriage of her once dreaded Rival mu&s;t have done it but in the Suppo&s;ition that &s;he had for ever lo&s;t his Heart, Jealou&s;y could not mingle with the Pangs &s;he felt for that Lo&s;s. Jealou&s;y is doubt, but &s;he was in ab&s;olute De&s;pair. Un|willing to interrupt by her Grief the Joy which the&s;e Nuptials diffu&s;ed among her Relations, or darken by her melancholy Ap|pearance the Pomp with which they were to be celebrated, &s;he re&s;olved to leave <HI>Paris</HI> a few Days before the Ceremony was per|formed. But an Accident happened which made her Change this Re&s;olution.</P>
<P>The Chevalier's a&s;&s;umed Appearance had for &s;ome Days pre&s;erved him from any par|ticular Notice, but at length his frequent Vi&s;its to the Street where the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> lived, his earne&s;t Gazing at the Hou&s;e, his eager Attention in ob&s;erving all who went in or out, attracted the Ob&s;er|vation of &s;ome of the Servants. Mademoi&s;elle
<PB N="236" REF="237">
<HI>de Gevincourt</HI>'s Woman, &s;he who had &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully pleaded her Lady's Cau&s;e when &s;he &s;topped the Chevalier's Journey to <HI>Paris,</HI> had a Curio&s;ity to &s;ee this Man who&s;e odd Behaviour furni&s;hed &s;o much Di&s;cour&s;e for the Dome&s;ticks of the Marquis. They pointed him out to her as he &s;auntered along the Street, his Eyes magnetically as it were, drawn up to the Windows of Madam <HI>de Berci's</HI> Apartment.</P>
<P>The faithful <HI>Maria</HI> felt an Emotion at the Sight of this Man, for which &s;he could not account; her Heart &s;eemed to acknow|ledge an Acquaintance with him, and guided by a &s;udden Impul&s;e, &s;he ran into the Street and followed him at a little Di&s;tance, expect|ing when he would turn that &s;he might &s;ee his Face.</P>
<P>The Chevalier, when he came to the End of the Street, &s;topped, as uncertain whether he &s;hould return to his Friend's Hou&s;e, or attempt once more to get a Sight of his Mi&s;tre&s;s. <HI>Maria</HI> who had already di&s;covered &s;omething in his Air and Mein, notwith|&s;tanding his Di&s;gui&s;e, which brought the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> to her Remembrance, was fully convinced that it was he, by the View &s;he now had of his Face. Tran&s;|ported with Joy, &s;he was upon the Point of acco&s;ting him, but prudently repre&s;t this fir&s;t motion, upon reflecting that he had doubtle&s;s a&s;&s;umed that Di&s;gui&s;e for &s;ome

important De&s;ign, which might be defeated by an un&s;ea&s;onable Di&s;covery, and there|fore pa&s;&s;ing by without &s;eeming to take Notice of him, &s;he entered the Hou&s;e again by a back Way, and flew to acquaint her Lady with what &s;he had &s;een.</P>
<P>Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt</HI> had ju&s;t quitted the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> whom &s;he had in vain endeavoured to per&s;wade to &s;tay in <HI>Paris,</HI> during the Celebration of her Nup|tials.
<Q>Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> is more dejected than ever, (&s;aid &s;he) to <HI>Maria,</HI> as &s;he entered her own Apartment. I love her &s;incerely, nor can I think my&s;elf happy while &s;he is unfortunate.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If it depends upon the Chevaliers Return Madam, &s;aid the overjoyed <HI>Maria,</HI> to make the Counte&s;s ea&s;y, &s;he will &s;oon be &s;o, for he is here in <HI>Paris,</HI> I have &s;een him.

<P>The charming Amazon had &s;carce Pati|ence to li&s;ten to her Woman's Account of the Chevalier's Di&s;gui&s;e, and the Manner in which &s;he di&s;covered him, &s;o eager was &s;he to communicate this good News to the young Marchione&s;s <HI>de Saint Sauveur.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Ladies being convinced from every Circum&s;tance of the Chevalier's Behaviour,
<PB N="238" REF="239">
that his Love for the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> was as ardent as ever, re&s;olved to acquaint her with all they had heard.</P>
<P>Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> affected to receive the News with great Compo&s;ure, but the &s;ud|den Tran&s;ition from Grief and De&s;pon|dency, to Joy and Hope, was too powerfully expre&s;t in her lovely Features, to leave them in doubt of the &s;weet Emotions with which her Heart was agitated; her Cheeks glowed with Blu&s;hes of Surpri&s;e and Plea&s;ure; her Eyes &s;parkled with a Vivacity they had been long unu&s;ed to; her Voice impercepti|bly to her&s;elf, lo&s;t its plaintive Accent. Her fair Friends ob&s;erved and were tran&s;ported at the Alteration. They now found it no difficult Ta&s;k to prevail upon her to &s;tay in <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P><Q>Depend, upon it &s;aid Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt,</HI> the Chevalier will not di&s;cover him&s;elf till after the Turnament, he is too fond of Glory to neglect this Op|portunity of &s;ignali&s;ing his Return by &s;ome noble Exploit, and he expects to agreeably &s;urpri&s;e his Friends.</Q>
The Ladies had in|deed gue&s;&s;ed truly, the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> re&s;olved to appear in the Li&s;ts, and when the Turnement was ended to make him|&s;elf known. He cau&s;ed a new Suit of Ar|mour to be made of the Colour of A&s;hes, be|neath which, bright Flames &s;eemed to break out; on his Shield was painted a Cupid, re|kindling

his Torch, with this Motto, <HI>re|vived by Kindne&s;s.</HI> The Chevalier fully de|termined to keep him&s;elf concealed till after the Turnament, would no more venture to walk di&s;gui&s;ed thro' the Street where his Mi&s;tre&s;s lived &mdash; the Appearance of <HI>Maria</HI> had alarmed him, and tho' he was per&s;uaded &s;he did not then know him, yet he was Apprehen&s;ive that a &s;econd View might give her Su&s;picions that would awake her Curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>In three Days the Nuptials of Made|moi&s;elle <HI>de Gevincourt</HI> were to be &s;olem|ni&s;ed, and the fourth was de&s;tined for the Turnament. During this Interval the Chevalier indulged the mo&s;t delightful Re|flections. His Imagination filled with the Idea of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> continually repre&s;ented her to him as di&s;&s;olved in Tears, lamenting his Lo&s;s, and devoting all her future Days to &s;olitude and Grief. How did he exult in the Thought that his Pre&s;ence would bani&s;h all her Sorrows, and re&s;tore her to Health, Peace, and Joy.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the wi&s;hed for Morning ap|peared, the Chevalier aro&s;e full of Hope and plea&s;ing Expectation, Mon&s;ieur <HI>la Ronvere</HI> would a&s;&s;i&s;t in putting on his Ar|mour, never did he look &s;o lovely Fierce as then, the Hero and the Lover were &s;o happily blendid in the maje&s;tick Sweet|ne&s;s of his Countenance, that it was impo&s;&s;ible
<PB N="240" REF="241">
to behold him without feeling at once De|light and Awe. At the Sound of the Trum|pets, the King and Queen, attended by the whole Court entered the Field, and took their Places upon a Magnificent Scaffold, erected for them.</P>
<P>The Bride glittering with Jewels but brighter in her own native Loveline&s;s, was placed on a Scaffold oppo&s;ite to their Ma|je&s;ties. On one Side of her &s;at the young Marchione&s;s <HI>de Saint-Sauveur,</HI> and on the other the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci.</HI> The Friends of that Lady who knew not her &s;ecret Motives for Emerging from that So|litude in which &s;he had been &s;o long buried, were &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee her in &s;o publick an A&s;&s;embly, her&s;elf gay as a Bride, and her charming Eyes animated with the &s;weete&s;t of all Pa&s;&s;ions Hope, dealing round their re&s;i&s;tle&s;s Glances, while they were in &s;earch of the beloved Object that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all her Thoughts.</P>
<P>Mean time a great Number of the young Lords of the Court had tilted again&s;t each other, with various Succe&s;s; four at length remained Ma&s;ters of the Field, and the Judges &s;eeing no other Knight offer him|&s;elf to the Combat, were going to declare them Victors when the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> pre&s;ented him&s;elf in the Li&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="242">The Eyes of the whole A&s;&s;embly were immediately fixed upon this la&s;t Comer, his noble Air, the Gracefulne&s;s of his Figure, and that charming Confidence with which he demanded the Combat, won every Heart.</P>
<P>The great <HI>Henry,</HI> delighted with his Ap|pearance, a&s;&s;ured the Queen that this Stranger would carry away the Honour of the Day. The Heart of Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> by its flut|tering Emotions in&s;tantly acknowledged its Conqueror. 'Tis he whi&s;pered &s;he in a Rapture to the Bride, who as well as the young Marchione&s;s <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> had anxiou&s;ly expected him.</P>
<P>But what cruel Tortures tore the Brea&s;t of the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> at the Sight of the Counte&s;s in a Place where he &s;o little expected to &s;ee her? &s;he, whom he had been told had ever &s;ince his Ab&s;ence devoted her&s;elf to Solitude and Melancholy, whom his fond Fancy had painted as di&s;&s;olved in Tears, and &s;unk in langui&s;hing Dejection, yet whom he now beheld dre&s;t with &s;tudied Elegance, as if de&s;irous of plea&s;ing; Joy &s;parkling in her Eyes, and Smiles of Plea&s;ure wande|ring over her lovely Face.
<Q>Perfidious Woman (&s;aid he to him&s;elf, as he &s;tood contemplating her) is it thus my Lo&s;s is mourned?</Q></P>
<P>Wild with Jealou&s;y and De&s;pair, he doubtle&s;s would have gone to the Scaffold
<PB N="242" REF="243">
where &s;he &s;at, and reproached her publickly for her Ingratitude and Incon&s;tancy; but the Sound of the Trumpets recalled him to him&s;elf, and now animated with Rage, In|dignation, and a De&s;ire of &s;hewing his faith|le&s;s Mi&s;tre&s;s that he de&s;erved, tho' he could not keep her Heart; with a Rapidity like Lightening he &s;prung forwards to meet his Adver&s;ary, and threw him to the Ground at the fir&s;t On&s;et.</P>
<P>His three other Cour&s;es were performed with the &s;ame Skill and Valour, and were indeed &s;o many Victories, and he remained &s;ole Ma&s;ter of the Field. The Air re|&s;ounded with the joyful Acclamations of the Multitude, and every Tongue repeated the Prai&s;es of the brave Stranger. The old Marquis <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> the Count of <HI>Berci,</HI> and the Marqui&s;&s;es <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> who in tho&s;e noble Exploits acknowledged the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> all eagerly crouded about him, and with the mo&s;t rapturous Expre&s;&s;ions of Joy, congratulated him on his Victory, and them&s;elves on his Return.</P>
<P>The Chevalier who would gladly have withdrawn him&s;elf from the Li&s;ts, to avoid being known, finding it impo&s;&s;ible to conceal him&s;elf any longer, took of his Ca&s;que, and embraced his Friends. The Gloom that hung upon his Brow, the Faintne&s;s of his Accent, and the apparent Di&s;order of his Mind filled them with Per|plexity
<PB N="243" REF="244">
and Grief, but they had no Lei&s;ure to enquire into the Cau&s;e of his Unea&s;ine&s;s, for the Judges of the Field approaching, led him to the Queen's Scaffold to receive the Prize.</P>
<P>That Prince&s;s, after complimenting the Chevalier upon his Succe&s;s, pre&s;ented him with a Jewel of great Value, which he received kneeling, and with a Grace that charmed every Beholder. The Great <HI>Henry</HI> who had been talking to the Marquis <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> advancing to meet him, as he was leaving the Queen, to go and throw him&s;elf at his Feet,
<Q>Chevalier, (&s;aid he, tapping his Shoulder with that ea&s;y Gaity, which was &s;o natu|ral to him) you have this Day di&s;graced four of the brave&s;t Lords in my Court, and in Revenge I will give you Fetters that &s;hall la&s;t you your Life.</Q>
All this Time the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> &s;uffered great In|quietude. She had fully ob&s;erved every Look and Motion of the Chevalier; but found not in them the ardent Lover her Ima|gination was &s;o full of. He did not once turn his Eyes towards the Place where &s;he &s;at, and after their Maje&s;ties were departed, he &s;hewed no Eagerne&s;s to pre&s;ent him&s;elf to her, but continued talking in an ea&s;y Manner to the Old Marquis <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> his Uncle; and when at la&s;t Civility obliged him to go and pay his Re&s;pects to the Bride, and her Company, he advanced not with the im|patient Step of a Lover, but loitering, care|le&s;s,
<PB N="244" REF="245">
and with an Attention, wholly di&s;engaged. Grief, Di&s;appointment, Anger, appeared by Turns in the fair Face of Madam <HI>de Berci;</HI> but &s;truggling to conceal her Emo|tions, &s;he received the Chevaliers Compli|ments, and returned them with a well per|&s;onated Indifference. The new Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> and the young Marchione&s;s <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> were a&s;toni&s;hed at the Chevalier's Behaviour, and would have doubted the Truth of what <HI>Maria</HI> had told them, con|cerning his Di&s;gui&s;e, had it not been con|firmed, to them by Mon&s;ieur <HI>la Ronvere,</HI> who thought he was no longer obliged to keep it &s;ecret, and was plea&s;ed to have an Opportunity of relating an Incident to the Counte&s;s, which &s;et the Pa&s;&s;ion of the Che|valier in &s;o &s;trong, and &s;o whim&s;ical a Light.</P>
<P>He more than any other was &s;urpri&s;ed at the cold and indifferent Manner in which the Chevalier acco&s;ted the Counte&s;s, be|cau&s;e he had &s;o lately been a Witne&s;s of the Tran&s;ports of his Pa&s;&s;ion. The two old Marqui&s;es <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> and <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> who hoped the Chevalier's Return would put an End to his Wanderings, and Madam <HI>de Berci's</HI> Grief by a happy Union, were both afflicted, and inraged at the Ca|prices of the&s;e Lovers, who &s;eemed deter|mined to render them&s;elves and their Friends for ever unhappy; but there was no Time to enter upon any Explanation, they were
<PB N="245" REF="246">
obliged to follow their Maje&s;ties to the Louvre. The Chevalier led the Bride to her Coach, and received her Hand again at the Gates of the Palace: during this Inter|val &s;he ob&s;erved him heedfully, and through all his a&s;&s;umed Gaity, di&s;covered that his Heart was not at Ea&s;e, &s;he was going to mention the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> to him, but they were now in the Pre&s;ence of their Ma|je&s;ties; and the brave old Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> approached to pre&s;ent the Bride to the King. Mon&s;ieur <HI>la Ronvere</HI> who was impatient to enquire into the Cau&s;e of the Chevalier's unaccountable Behaviour, &s;eeing him di&s;engaged, drew him a&s;ide, and ex|po&s;tulated with him upon it.</P>
<P><Q>Ah, Friend (&s;aid the Chevalier &s;ighing) you have deceived me cruelly, could I have expected to &s;ee the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> in &s;o publick an A&s;&s;embly, after the Re|pre&s;entation you made me of her Melan|cholly, her Love of Solitude, and her continued Tenderne&s;s for me!</Q></P>
<P><Q>You are indeed deceived, (&s;aid Mon|&s;ieur <HI>la Ronvere</HI>) but it is by the Sug|ge&s;tions of your own jealous Fancy. It was the Hope of &s;eeing you that carried Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> to the Turnament.</Q>
He then related to him in what Manner he was di&s;covered in his Di&s;gui&s;e; the Effect that News had on his Mi&s;tre&s;s, who con|cluding
<PB N="246" REF="247">
he would appear at the Turnament, yielded to her Friend's Intreaties to be there.</P>
<P>The&s;e few Words entirely removed the Chevalier's Su&s;picions, all his Jealou&s;y vani&s;h|ed in a Moment, and gave Place to Love, Hope and Joy; already his altered Looks prepared the Counte&s;s for a different Be|haviour, the pa&s;&s;ionate yet re&s;pectful Glan|ces he gave her, did not e&s;cape her Notice, &s;he blu&s;hed with Plea&s;ure and Surpri&s;e; yet &s;till kept up her a&s;&s;umed Indifference. The Chevalier was &s;tepping towards her, when the Marquis <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> his Uncle fixed all his Attention, by addre&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf in this Manner to the King.</P>
<P><Q>It is with inconceivable Regret, my gra|cious Sovereign, that I find my&s;elf obliged to interrupt the Happine&s;s of this Day, with Complaints of my Nephew's Ingra|titude. Your Maje&s;ty will ea&s;ily imagine that his Offences mu&s;t needs be very great, &s;ince they have forced me to take this extraordinary Method to bring him to a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of his Duty.</Q></P>
<P>This &s;trange Speech filled all that were pre&s;ent with A&s;toni&s;hment and Unea&s;ine&s;s. The Chevalier was in the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion, and the poor Counte&s;s wondered what new Mi&s;eries were preparing for her.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="248">The King having ordered the Marquis to proceed.
<Q>Your Maje&s;ty, re&s;umed he, and the whole Kingdom have been Witne&s;&s;es to the more than parental Affection I have born to that ungrateful Man; loaded with Years and Infirmities, I came in Arms to defend his Innocence, and expo&s;ed my Life to pre&s;erve his Honour. It would be an end|le&s;s Ta&s;k to repeat all the Benefits I have conferred upon him, which he has only repaid by an ob&s;tinate Di&s;obedience to my Will; twice I have attempted to &s;e|cure his Happine&s;s, by an honourable and advantagious Match, and each Time he has eluded my Wi&s;hes, and voluntarily bani&s;hed him&s;elf from his Country rather than comply with the Propo&s;als I made him.</Q></P>
<P>Scarce had the Marquis <HI>des E&s;&s;ars</HI> ended this Speech, when the old Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> following his lead, thus adre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the King.
<Q>Sire, (&s;aid he) my Daughter is not le&s;s guilty than the Che|valier, after all the Mi&s;eries &s;he has &s;uf|fered her&s;elf, after all the Affliction &s;he has given her Parents and Friends on his Account; &s;he has denied to give him her Hand, and to make her Di&s;obedience more remarkable, refu&s;ed to con&s;ent to what &s;he once &s;o ardently de&s;ired when it became our Will &s;he &s;hould do &s;o.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e Complaints which at the Beginning had &s;pread &s;o much Con&s;ternation through
<PB N="148" REF="249">
the Company, and had filled the two Per|&s;ons mo&s;t concerned in them, with Grief and Confu&s;ion, now produced Smiles of Plea&s;ure on every Face. The Chevalier was overjoyed &s;ince he found they were likely to terminate in his Marriage with the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> who&s;e fair Face, though over&s;pread with Blu&s;hes, expre&s;&s;ed no Signs of Di&s;&s;atisfaction.
<Q>Sire, (&s;aid the Che|valier, bowing profoundly low to the King) I &s;hould be the ba&s;e&s;t of Men if I did not acknowledge that the Obligations I have received from the Marquis <HI>des E&s;|&s;ars</HI> are above all Gratitude and Return; I have indeed too long delayed to give him tho&s;e Proofs of my Obedience and Submi&s;&s;ion to his Will, which he de&s;ires, but I hope he will pardon an Error which I die with Impatience to repair.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And what have you to &s;ay, Madam, &s;aid the King &s;miling, to the Complaints your Father has made of you?</Q>
Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> who only wanted to yield with Dignity, and expected a new Command from her Father and the King, replied with inaffable Grace:
<Q>That I have been the Cau&s;e of any Affliction to my Parents is one of the greate&s;t Misfortunes of my Life: but your Maje&s;ty is, I hope convinced, that my Will has not always been in Fault; &s;ome Errors I have been led into from Want of Experience, but many more by a &s;trange Concurrence of Circum|&s;tances,
<PB N="249" REF="250">
which hardly left me the Freedom of Choice. As to the Point on which my Father claims my Obedience, I can only &s;ay, that the Condition of my Wi|dowhood and other important Rea&s;ons have &s;eemed to me &s;ufficient to di&s;pen&s;e with it.</Q></P>
<P>The Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci</HI> did not imagine the King would be &s;atisfied with this Ex|cu&s;e; but &s;he had &s;oon Cau&s;e to repent of her Di&s;ingenuity, for that Prince, who thought there was great Force in her Plea, declared that &s;he &s;hould be at Liberty to fol|low her Inclinations.</P>
<P>Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> was in the utmo&s;t Con|fu&s;ion at this unlooked for Deci&s;ion; her Father was concerned, and her Friends were in Pain for her; but the Chevalier, to whom it &s;eemed the Sentence of his Death, was in De&s;pair, and approaching the Counte&s;s, who was in vi&s;ible Emotions,
<Q>Ah, Madam, (&s;aid he) are all my Suffe|rings for you forgot, and can you doom to cea&s;ele&s;s Mi&s;ery a Man who &s;o ar|dently loves, and has &s;o faithfully &s;erved you?</Q></P>
<P>Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> made no An&s;wer; but the King who watched her Eyes and read in them all that pa&s;&s;ed in her Heart, &s;aw his Interpo&s;ition was nece&s;&s;ary. And taking her Hand,
<Q>If I di&s;pen&s;ed with your Obedience
<PB N="250" REF="251">
to your Father, Madam, (&s;aid he) I will not to your King, he regulated your fir&s;t Choice, the &s;econd &s;hall be yours and mine.</Q>
Saying this, he pre&s;ented her Hand to the Chevalier, who received it with a Tran&s;port, which hardly left him Power to expre&s;s his Gratitude. His Maje&s;ty to favour the Coun|te&s;s's Confu&s;ion, who&s;e charming Face was all over&s;pread with Blu&s;hes, drew the Marquis <HI>de Saint-Sauveur</HI> a&s;ide and entered into Di&s;cour&s;e with him: this little Inter|val the Lovers employed, in removing tho&s;e Doubts which had retarded their Happine&s;s, and were likely to have &s;aparated them for ever. When his Maje&s;ty joined the Com|pany he found Madam <HI>de Berci</HI> with the Queen, that Prince&s;s who had conceived a great E&s;teem for the Chevalier <HI>des E&s;&s;ars,</HI> and had been much moved with the Mis|fortunes of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berci,</HI> congra|tulated them on this happy Event in Terms highly obliging to them both. The next Day &s;aw the Celebration of their Nuptials, and every &s;ucceeding one brought an In|crea&s;e of Happine&s;s to a Pair united as well by Virtue as by Love.</P>
