<HEAD>THE WAY TO PLENTY; OR, THE <HI>SECOND PART OF TOM WHITE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TOM WHITE, as we have &s;hewn in the fir&s;t part of this hi&s;tory, from an idle po&s;t-boy was become a re&s;pectable farmer. GOD had ble&s;&s;ed his indu&s;try and he had pro&s;pered in the world. He was &s;ober and temperate, and, as was the natural con&s;equence, he was active and healthy. He was indu&s;trious and frugal, and he became pro&s;perous in his circum|&s;tances. This is in the ordinary cour&s;e
<PB N="4" REF="3">of Providence. But it is not a certain and nece&s;&s;ary rule. GOD <HI>maketh his &s;un to &s;hine on the ju&s;t and the unju&s;t.</HI> A man who u&s;es every hone&s;t means of thirft and indu&s;try, will, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, find &s;ucce&s;s attend his labours. But &s;till the <HI>race is not always to the &s;wift, nor the battle to the &s;trong.</HI> GOD his &s;ometimes plea&s;ed for wi&s;e ends, to di&s;appoint all the worldly hopes of the mo&s;t upright man. His corn may be &s;mitten by a blight. His barns may be con&s;umed by fire. His cattle may be carried off by di&s;temper. And to the&s;e, and other misfortunes, he is as liable as the &s;pendthrift or the knave. Succe&s;s is the <HI>common</HI> reward of indu&s;try, but if it were its <HI>con&s;tant</HI> reward, the indu&s;trious would be tempted to look no further than the pre&s;ent &s;tate. They would lo&s;e one &s;trong ground of their faith. It would &s;et a&s;ide the Scripture &s;cheme. This world would be looked on as a &s;tate of reward, in&s;tead of a &s;tate of trial, and we &s;hould forget to look to a day of final retri|bution.</P>
<P>Farmer <HI>White</HI> never took it into his head, that becau&s;e he paid his debts, worked early and late, and ate the bread
<PB N="5" REF="4">of carefulne&s;s, he was therefore to come into no <HI>misfortune like other folk,</HI> but was to be free from the common trials and troubles of life. He knew that pro&s;perity was far from being a &s;ure mark of GOD'S favour, and had read in good books, and e&s;pecially in the bible, of the great po|verty and afflictions of the be&s;t of men. Though he was no great &s;cholar, he had &s;en&s;e enough to ob&s;erve, that a time of public pro&s;perity was not always a time of public virtue; and he thought that what was true of a whole nation might be true of one man. So the more he pro&s;pered the more he prayed that pro&s;perity might not corrupt his heart. And when he &s;aw lately &s;igns of public di&s;tre&s;s coming on, he was not half &s;o much frightened as &s;ome others were, becau&s;e he thought it might do us good in the long run; and he was in hopes that a little poverty might bring on a little penitence. The great grace he laboured after was that of a cheerful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. He u&s;ed to &s;ay, that if the Lord's Prayer had only con|tained tho&s;e four little words THY WILL BE DONE, it would be worth more than the bigge&s;t book in the world without them.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5">Dr. Shepherd, the worthy Vicar, (with whom the farmer's wife had formerly lived as hou&s;ekeeper) was very fond of taking a walk with him about his grounds, and he u&s;ed to &s;ay, that he learnt as much from the farmer as the farmer did from him. If the Doctor happened to ob&s;erve, I am afraid the&s;e long rains will &s;poil this fine piece of oats, the farmer would an&s;wer, "but then, &s;ir, think how good it is for the gra&s;s." If the Doctor feared the wheat would be but indifferent, the farmer was &s;ure the rye would turn out well. When gra&s;s failed, he did not doubt but turnips would be plenty. Even for floods and inundations he would find out &s;ome way to ju&s;tify Providence. "'Tis better," &s;aid he, "to have our lands a little over|flowed, than that the &s;prings &s;hould be dried up, and our cattle faint for lack of water." When the drought came, he thanked GOD that the &s;ea&s;on would be healthy; and high winds, which fright|ened others, he &s;aid &s;erved to clear the air. Whoever, or whatever was wrong, he was always &s;ure that PROVIDENCE was in the right. And he u&s;ed to &s;ay, that a man with ever &s;o &s;mall an income if he had but frugality and temperance, and
<PB N="7" REF="6">ca&s;t off all vain de&s;ires, was richer than a lord who was tormented by vanity and covetou&s;ne&s;s. When he &s;aw others in the wrong, he did not however a|bu&s;e them for it, but took care to avoid the &s;ame fault. He had &s;en&s;e and &s;pi|rit enough to break through many old but very bad cu&s;toms of his neighbours. "If a thing is wrong in it&s;elf," (&s;aid he one day to farmer Hodges) "a whole pari&s;h doing it can't make it right. And as to it's being an old cu&s;tom, why if it be a good one I like it the better for being old, becau&s;e it has had the &s;tamp of ages, and the &s;anction of experience on it's worth. But if it be old as well as bad, that is another rea&s;on for my trying to put an end to it, that we may not mi&s;lead our children as our fathers have mi&s;led us."</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The ROOF-RAISING.</HEAD>
<P>SOME years after he was &s;ettled, he built a large new barn. All the work|men were looking forward to the u&s;ual holiday of roof-rai&s;ing. On this occa|&s;ion it was a cu&s;tom to give a dinner to the workmen, with &s;o much liquor af|ter it that they got &s;o drunk, that they
<PB N="8" REF="7">not only lo&s;t the remaining half day's work, but they were not always able to work the next day.</P>
<P>Mrs. White provided a plentiful din|ner for roof rai&s;ing, and gave each man his mug of beer. After a hearty meal they began to grow clamorous for more drink. The farmer &s;aid, "My lads, I don't grudge you a few gallons of ale merely for the &s;ake of &s;aving my liquor, though that is &s;ome con&s;ideration; but I never will, knowingly, help any man to make a bea&s;t of him&s;elf. I am re|&s;olved to break through a bad cu&s;tom. You are now well refre&s;hed. If you will go cheerfully to your work, you will have half a day's pay to take on Saturday night more than you would if this af|ternoon were wa&s;ted in drunkenne&s;s. For this your families will be the better: whereas, were I to give you more liquor when you have already had enough, I &s;hould help to rob them of their bread. But I wi&s;h to &s;hew you, that I have your good at heart full as much as my own profit. If you will now go to work, I will give you all another mug at night when you leave off. Thus your time
<PB N="9" REF="8">will be &s;aved, your families helped, and my ale will not go to make rea&s;onable creatures wor&s;e than brute bea&s;ts."</P>
<P>Here he &s;topped. "You are in the right on't, Ma&s;ter," &s;aid Tom the thatcher; "You are a hearty man, Farmer," &s;aid John Plane the carpenter. "Come a|long boys," &s;aid Tim Brick the ma&s;on; &s;o they all went merrily to work, for|tified with a good dinner. There was only one drunken &s;urly fellow who refu&s;ed, that was Dick Guzzle the Smith. Dick never works above two or three days in the week, and &s;pends the others at the Red Lion. He &s;wore, that if the farmer did not let him have as much liquor as he liked at Roof-Rai&s;|ing, he would not &s;trike another &s;troke, but would leave the job unfini&s;hed, and he might get hands where he could. Farmer White took him at his word, and paid him off directly: glad enough to get rid of &s;uch a &s;ot, whom he had only employed from pity to a large and almo&s;t &s;tarving family. When the men came for their mug in the evening, the farmer brought out the remains of the cold gammon; they made a hearty &s;upper
<PB N="10" REF="9">and thanked him for having broke through a fooli&s;h cu&s;tom, which was afterwards much left off in that pari&s;h, though Dick would not come into it, and lo&s;t mo&s;t of his work.</P>
<P>Farmer White's labourers were often complaining, that things were &s;o dear that they could not buy a bit of meat. He knew it was partly true, but not en|tirely, for it was before the&s;e very hard times. One morning he &s;tept out to &s;ee how an outhou&s;e which he was thatch|ing went on. He was &s;upri&s;ed to find the work at a &s;tand. He walked over to the thatcher's hou&s;e. "Tom," &s;aid he, "I de&s;ire that piece of work may be fini&s;hed directly. If a &s;hower comes my grain will be &s;poiled." "Indeed, Ma&s;ter, I &s;han't work to-day; nor to|morrow neither," &s;aid Tom. "You for|get that 'tis Ea&s;ter Monday, and to-morrow is Ea&s;ter Tue&s;day. And &s;o on Wedne&s;|day I &s;hall thatch away ma&s;ter. But 'tis hard if a poor man who works all the year may not enjoy the&s;e few holidays.</P>
<P>"Tom," &s;aid the farmer, "when the&s;e days were fir&s;t put into our prayer-book,
<PB N="11" REF="10">the good men who did it, lit|tle thought that the time would come when <HI>holyday</HI> &s;hould mean <HI>drunken-day.</HI> How much do&s;t think now I &s;hall pay thee for this piece of thatch?" "Why you know ma&s;ter you have let it to me by the great. I think between this and to-mor|row night, as the weather is &s;o fine, I could clear about four &s;hillings, after I have paid my boy. But thatching does not come often, and other work is not &s;o profitable." "Very well, Tom; and how much now do you think you may &s;pend in the&s;e two holidays?" "Why ma&s;ter, if the ale is plea&s;ant, and the company mer|ry, I do not expect to get off for le&s;s than three &s;hillings." "Tom, can you do pounds, &s;hillings, and pence?" "I can make a little &s;core ma&s;ter behind the kitchen door with a bit of chalk, which is as much as I want." "Well Tom, add the four &s;hillings you would have earned to the three you intend to &s;pend, what does that make?" "Let me &s;ee! three and four make &s;even. Seven &s;hillings ma&s;ter." "Tom, you often tell me the times are &s;o bad that you can never buy a bit of meat. Now here is the co&s;t of two joints at once; to &s;ay nothing of the &s;in of wa&s;ting time
<PB N="12" REF="11">and getting drunk." "I never once thought of that," &s;aid Tom. "Now Tom," &s;aid the farmer, "if I were you, I would &s;tep over to Butcher Jobbins's, buy a &s;houlder of mutton, which being left from Saturday's market you will get a little cheaper. This I would make my wife bake in a deep di&s;h full of potatoes. I would then go to work, and when the dinner was ready I would go and enjoy it with my wife and children; you need not give the mutton to the brats; the potatoes will have all the gravy, and be very &s;avory for them." "Aye, but I've got no beer ma&s;ter, the times are &s;o hard that a poor man can't afford to brew a drop of drink now as we u&s;ed to do."</P>
<P>"Times are bad, and malt is very dear Tom, and yet both don't prevent your throwing away &s;even &s;hillings in keeping holiday. Now &s;end for a quart of ale, as it is to be a fea&s;t; and you will even then be four &s;hillings richer than if you had gone to the publick hou&s;e. I would put by the&s;e four &s;hillings, till I could add a couple to them; with this I would get a bu&s;hel of malt, and my wife &s;hould brew
<PB N="13" REF="12">it, and you may take a pint at home of a night, which will do you more good than a gallon at the Red Lion" "I have a great mind to take your advice, ma&s;ter, but I &s;hall be made &s;uch fun of at the Lion; they will &s;o laugh at me if I don't go." Let tho&s;e laugh that win, Tom." "But ma&s;ter, I have got a friend to meet me there." "Then a&s;k your friend to come and eat a bit of your cold mutton at night, and here is &s;ix-pence for another pot, if you will promi&s;e to brew a &s;mall ca&s;k of your own." "Thank you, ma&s;|ter, and &s;o I will; and I won't go to the Lion. Come boy, bring the helm, and fetch the ladder." And &s;o Tom was upon the roof in a twinkling.</P>

<HEAD>The SHEEP SHEARING.</HEAD>
<P>Dr. Shepherd happened to &s;ay to Farmer White one day, "that there was nothing he di&s;liked more than the manner, in which &s;heep-&s;hearing and harve&s;t home were kept by &s;ome in his pari&s;h. What, &s;aid the good Doctor, ju&s;t when we are ble&s;t with the&s;e natural riches of our land, the fleece of our flocks; when our barns are crowned with plenty, and we have
<PB N="14" REF="13">reaped the fruits of the earth in due &s;ea|&s;on; is that very time to be &s;et apart for ribaldry, and riot, and drunkenne&s;s? Do we thank GOD for his mercies by making our&s;elves unworthy and unfit to enjoy them?</P>
<P>"I thank you for the hint, &s;ir," &s;aid the farmer, "I am re&s;olved to rejoice though, and others &s;hall rejoice with me; And we will have a merry night on't."</P>
<P>So Mrs. White dre&s;&s;ed a very plentiful &s;upper of meat and pudding; and &s;pread out two tables. The farmer &s;at at the head of one, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ome of the neigh|bours, and all his work-people. At the other &s;at his wife, with two long benches on each &s;ide of her. At the&s;e &s;at all the old and infirm poor, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who lived in the workhou&s;e, and had no day of fe&s;tivity to look forward to in the whole year but this. On the gra&s;s, in the little court, &s;at the children of his labourers, and of the other poor, who&s;e employment it had been to gather flowers, and dre&s;s and adorn the horns of the ram; for the farmer did not wi&s;h to put an end to any old cu&s;tom, if it was innocent. His own
<PB N="15" REF="14">children &s;tood by the table, and he gave them plenty of pudding, which they car|ried to the children of the poor, with a little draught of cider to every one.</P>
<P>This fea&s;t, though orderly and decent, was yet hearty and cheerful. Dr. Shep|herd dropped in with a good deal of com|pany he had at his hou&s;e, and they were much plea&s;ed. When the Doctor &s;aw how the aged and the infirm poor were enjoy|ing them&s;elves, he was much moved; he &s;hook the &s;armer by the hand, and &s;aid, "But thou, when thou make&s;t a fea&s;t, call the blind, and the lame, and the halt; they cannot recompen&s;e thee, but thou &s;halt be recompen&s;ed at the re&s;urrection of the ju&s;t."</P>
<P>"Sir," &s;aid the farmer, "'tis no great matter of expence, I kill a &s;heep of my own; potatoes are as plenty as blackber|ries, with people who have a little fore|thought. I &s;ave much more cider in the cour&s;e of a year by never allowing any carou&s;ing in my kitchen, or drunkenne&s;s in my fields, than would &s;upply many &s;uch fea&s;ts as the&s;e, &s;o that I &s;hall be never the poorer at Chri&s;tmas. It is cheaper
<PB N="16" REF="15">to make people happy, &s;ir, than to wake them drunk. The Doctor and the ladies conde&s;cended to walk from one table to the other, and heard many merry &s;tories, but not one profane word, or one in|decent &s;ong; &s;o that he was not forced to the painful nece&s;&s;ity either of reprov|ing them, or leaving them in anger. When all was over they &s;ung the &s;ixty|fifth p&s;alm, and the ladies all joined in it, and when they got home to the vi|carage to tea, they declared they liked it better than any concert.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The HARD WINTER.</HEAD>
<P>IN the famous cold winter of the pre|&s;ent year, 1795, it was edifying to &s;ee how patiently farmer White bore that long and &s;evere fro&s;t. Many of his &s;heep were frozen to death, but he thank|ed GOD that he had &s;till many left. He continued to find in-door work that his men might not be out of employ. Mrs. White was &s;o con&s;iderate, that ju&s;t at that time &s;he le&s;&s;ened the number of her hogs, that &s;he might have more whey and &s;kim milk to a&s;&s;i&s;t poor fa|milies. Nay, I have known her live
<PB N="17" REF="16">on boiled meat for a long while toge|ther, in a &s;ickly &s;ca&s;on, becau&s;e the pot|liquor made &s;uch a &s;upply of broth for the &s;ick poor. As the &s;pring came on and things grew wor&s;e, &s;he never had a cake, a pye, or a pudding in her hou&s;e; though &s;he u&s;ed to have plenty of the&s;e good things, and will again I hope when the pre&s;ent &s;carcity is over; though &s;he &s;ays &s;he never will u&s;e &s;uch white flour again, even if it &s;hould come down to five &s;hillings a bu&s;hel.</P>
<P>All the pari&s;h now began to murmur. Farmer Jones was &s;ure the fro&s;t had killed the wheat. Farmer Wil&s;on &s;aid the rye would never come up. Brown the malt&s;ter in&s;i&s;ted the barley was dead at the root. Butcher Jobbins &s;aid beef would be a &s;hilling a pound. All de|clared there would not be a hop to brew with. The orchards were all blighted, there would not be apples enough to make a pye; and as to hay there would be none to be had for love nor money. "I'll tell you what," &s;aid farmer White, "the &s;ea&s;on is dreadful. The crops are unpromi&s;ing ju&s;t now: but 'tis too early to judge. Don't let us make things
<PB N="18" REF="17">wor&s;e than they are. We ought to com|fort the poor, and you are driving them to de&s;pair. Don't you know how much GOD was di&s;plea&s;ed with the murmurs of his cho&s;en people? And yet, when they were tired of manna he &s;ent them quails; but all did not do. Nothing &s;atisfies grumblers. We have a promi&s;e on our &s;ide, that there &s;hall be &s;eed time and harve&s;t time to the end. Let us then hope for a good day, but provide again&s;t an evil one. Let us rather prevent the evil before it is come upon us, than &s;ink under it when it comes. Grumbling can't help us. Activity can. Let us &s;et about planting potatoes in every nook and corner, in ca&s;e the corn <HI>&s;hould</HI> fail, which however I don't believe. Let us mend our management before we are driven to it by actual want. And if we allow our hone&s;t labourers to plant a few potatoes for their families in the head lands of our ploughed fields, or other wa&s;te bits of ground, it will do us no harm, and be a great help to them."</P>
<P>The farmer had many temptations to &s;end his corn at an extravagant price to
<PB N="19" REF="18">a <HI>certain &s;ea <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">port town;</HI> but as he knew that it was intended to export it again&s;t law, he would not be tempted to encourage unlawful gain; &s;o he thre&s;hed out a &s;mall mow at a time, and &s;old it to the neighbouring poor far below the market price. He &s;erved his own work|men fir&s;t. This was the &s;ame to them as if he had rai&s;ed their wages, and even better, as it was a benefit of which their families were &s;ure to partake. If the poor in the next pari&s;h were more di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed than his own, he &s;old to them at the &s;ame rate. "For," &s;aid he, "there is no di&s;tinction of pari&s;hes in heaven, and though charity begins at home, yet it ought not to end there."</P>
<P>He had been u&s;ed in good times now and then to catch a hare or a partridge, as he was qualified. But he now re&s;olv|ed to give up that plea&s;ure. So he part|ed from a couple of &s;paniels he had; for he &s;aid he could not bear that his dogs &s;hould be eating the meat, or the milk which &s;o many men, women, and children wanted.</P>

<HEAD>The WHITE LOAF.</HEAD>
<P>ONE day, it was about the middle of la&s;t July, when things &s;eemed to be at the deare&s;t, and the Rulers of the land had agreed to &s;et the example of eating nothing but coar&s;e bread. Doctor Shep|herd read, before &s;ermon, in the church their public declaration, which the magi&s;|trates of the county &s;ent him, and had al&s;o &s;igned them&s;elves. Mrs. White of cour&s;e was at church, and commended it migh|tily. Next morning the Doctor took a walk over to the farmer's, in order to &s;ettle further plans for the relief of the pari&s;h. He was much &s;urpri&s;ed to meet Mrs. White's little maid Sally with a very &s;mall white loaf, which &s;he had been buying at a &s;hop. He &s;aid nothing to the girl, as he never thought it right to expo&s;e the faults of a mi&s;tre&s;s to her &s;ervant; but walked on, re&s;olving to give Mrs. White a &s;evere lecture for the fir&s;t time in his life. He &s;oon changed his mind, for on going into the kitchen the fir&s;t per&s;on he &s;aw was Tom the thatcher, who had had a &s;ad fall from a ladder; his arm, which was &s;lipped out of his &s;leeve, was &s;welled in a frightful manner.
<PB N="21" REF="20">Mrs. White was &s;tanding at the dre&s;&s;er making the little white loaf into a poul|tice, which &s;he laid upon the &s;welling in a large clean old cloth.</P>
<P>"I a&s;k your pardon, my good Sarah," &s;aid the Doctor, "I ought not, however appearances were again&s;t you, to have &s;u&s;pected that &s;o humble and prudent a woman as you are, would be led either to indulge any daintine&s;s of your own, or to fly in the face of your betters, by eating white bread while they are eating brown. Whenever I come here I &s;ee it is not needful to be rich in order to be charitable. A bountiful rich man would have &s;ent Tom to a &s;urgeon, who would have done no more for him than you have done; for in tho&s;e inflamma|tions the mo&s;t &s;kilful &s;urgeon could only apply a poultice; Your kindne&s;s in dre&s;|&s;ing the wound your&s;elf, will, I doubt not, perform the cure at the expence of that three-penny loaf and a little hog's lard. And I will take care that Tom &s;hall have a good &s;upply of Rice from the Sub|&s;cription." "And he &s;han't want for &s;kim milk," &s;aid Mrs. White, and was he the be&s;t lord in the land, in the &s;tate he is in, a di&s;h

<HEAD>The PARISH MEETING.</HEAD>
<P>ON the tenth of Augu&s;t the ve&s;try held another meeting, to con&s;ult on the be&s;t method of further a&s;&s;i&s;ting the poor. The abundant crops now cheered every heart. Farmer White had a mind to be a little jocular with his de&s;ponding neighbours. Well, neighbour Jones," &s;aid he, "all the wheat was killed, I &s;uppo&s;e. The barley all dead at the root. Farmer Jones look|ed &s;heepi&s;h, and &s;aid, to be &s;ure the crops had turned out better than he thought. Then," &s;aid Dr. Shepherd, "let us learn tru&s;t Providence another time."</P>
<P>Among other things, they agreed to &s;ub&s;cribe for a large quantity of rice, which was to be &s;old out to the poor at a very low price, and Mrs. White was &s;o kind as to undertake the trouble of &s;elling it. After their day's work was over, all who wi&s;hed to buy at the&s;e reduced rates were ordered to come to the farm on the Tue&s;day evening. Dr. Shepherd dropped in at the &s;ame time, and when Mrs. White
<PB N="23" REF="22">had done weighing her rice, the Doctor &s;poke as follows: "My hone&s;t friends, it has plea&s;ed GOD to vi&s;it this land with a &s;carcity, to which we have been little accu&s;tomed. There are &s;ome idle evil minded people who are on the watch for public di&s;tre&s;&s;es, not that they may humble them&s;elves un|der the mighty hand of GOD, (which is the true u&s;e to be made of all troubles) but that they may benefit them&s;elves by di&s;turbing the public peace. The&s;e peo|ple, by riot and drunkenne&s;s, double the evil which they pretend to cure. Riot will compleat our misfortunes, while peace, indu&s;try, and good management, will go near to cure them. Bread to be &s;ure is uncommonly dear. Among the various ways of making it cheaper, one is to re|duce the quality of it, another, to le&s;&s;en the quantity we con&s;ume. If we cannot get enough of coar&s;e wheaten bread, let us make it of other grain. Or let us mix one half of potatoes, and one half of wheat. This la&s;t is what I eat in my own family. It is plea&s;ant and whole|&s;ome. Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour are barley
<PB N="24" REF="23">bread you know, as we were told in the la&s;t month's Sunday Reading of the Cheap Repo&s;itory, which I hope you have all heard; as I de&s;ired the ma&s;ter of the Sun|day &s;chool to read it ju&s;t after evening &s;ervice, when I know many of the parents are apt to call in at the &s;chool. This is a good cu&s;tom, and one of tho&s;e little books &s;hall be often read at that time.</P>
<P>"My good women, I truly feel for you at this time of &s;carcity; and I am go|ing to &s;hew my good will, as much by my advice as my &s;ub&s;cription. It is my duty, as your friend and mini&s;ter, to tell you, that one half of your pre&s;ent hard|&s;hips is owing to BAD MANAGEMENT. I often meet your children without &s;hoes and &s;tockings, with great luncheons of the very white&s;t bread, and that three times a day. Half that quantity, and &s;till le&s;s if it were coar&s;e, put into a di&s;h of good onion or leek porridge, would make them an excellent breakfa&s;t. Many too of the very poore&s;t of you eat your bread hot from the oven; this makes the difference of one loaf in five; I a&s;&s;ure you 'tis what I cannot afford to do. Come
<PB N="25" REF="24">Mrs. White, you may a&s;&s;i&s;t me a little. I am not very knowing in the&s;e matters my&s;elf; but I know that the rich would be twice as charitable, if the poor made a better u&s;e of their bounty. Mrs. White do give the&s;e poor women a little advice how to make their pittance go further than it now does. When you lived with me you were famous for making us nice, cheap di&s;hes, and I dare &s;ay you are not le&s;s notable now you manage for your|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lf."</P>
<P>"Indeed neighbours, &s;aid Mrs. White, what the good doctor &s;ays is very true, A halfpenny worth of oatmeal or groats, with a leek or onion, out of your own garden, which co&s;ts nothing, a bit of &s;alt, and a little coar&s;e bread, will breakfa&s;t your whole family. It is a great mi&s;take at any time to think a bit of meat &s;o rui|nous, and a great load of bread &s;o cheap. A poor man gets &s;even or eight &s;hillings a week; if he is careful he brings it home. I dare not &s;ay how much of this goes for tea in the afternoon, now &s;ugar and but|ter are &s;o dear, becau&s;e I &s;hould have you all upon me, but I will &s;ay that too
<PB N="26" REF="25">much of this little goes even for bread, from a notion that it is the harde&s;t fare. This at all times, but particularly ju&s;t now, is bad management. Dry pea&s;e to be &s;ure have been very dear lately; but now they are plenty enough. I am cer|tain then, that if a &s;hilling or two of the &s;even or eight was laid out for a bit of coar&s;e beef, a &s;heep's head, or any &s;uch thing, it would be well be&s;towed. I would throw a couple of pound of this into the pot, with two or three handfuls of grey peas, an onion, and a little pepper. Then I would throw in cabbage, or tur|nip, and carrot; or any garden &s;tuff that was mo&s;t plenty; let it &s;tew two or three hours, and it will make a di&s;h fit for his Maje&s;ty. The working man &s;hould have the meat; the children don't want it, the &s;oup will be thick and &s;ub&s;tantial, and re|quires no bread.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>RICE MILK.</HEAD>
<P>"YOU who can get &s;kim milk, as all our workmen can, have a great advantage. A quart of this, and a quarter of a pound of the rice you have ju&s;t bought, a little
<PB N="27" REF="26">bit of all &s;pice, and brown &s;ugar, will make a dainty and a cheap di&s;h."</P>
<P>"Ble&s;s your heart!" muttered Amy Grumble, who looked as dirty as a cinder|wench, with her face and fingers all daub|ed with &s;nuff; "rice milk indeed! it is very nice to be &s;ure for tho&s;e who can dre&s;s it, but we have not a bit of coal; rice is of no u&s;e to us without firing." "And yet," &s;aid the Doctor, "I &s;ee your tea-kettle boiling twice every day, as I pa&s;s by the poor-hou&s;e, and fre&s;h butter at eleven|pence a pound on your &s;helf." "O dear, &s;ir," cried Amy, "a few &s;ticks &s;erve to boil the tea-kettle." "And a few more," &s;aid the Doctor, "will boil the rice milk, and give twice the nouri&s;hment at a quarter of the expence."</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>RICE PUDDING.</HEAD>
<P>"PRAY <HI>Sarah,"</HI> &s;aid the Doctor, "how did you u&s;e to make that pudding my children were &s;o fond of? And I re|member when it was cold, we u&s;ed to have it in the parlour for &s;upper." "Nothing more ea&s;y," &s;aid Mrs. White. "I put
<PB N="28" REF="27">half a pound of rice, two quarts of &s;kim milk, and two ounces of brown &s;ugar." "Well," &s;aid the Doctor, "and how many will this dine?" "Seven or eight, &s;ir." Very well, and what will it co&s;t?" Why, &s;ir, it did not co&s;t you &s;o much becau&s;e we baked it at home, and I u&s;ed our own milk; it will not co&s;t above &s;even-pence to tho&s;e who pay for both. Here too bread is &s;aved."</P>
<P>"Pray, Sarah, let me put in a word," &s;aid farmer White. "I advi&s;e my men to rai&s;e each a large bed of par&s;nips. They are very nouri&s;hing, and very pro|fitable. Sixpennyworth of &s;eed, well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">owed, and trod in, will produce more meals than four &s;acks of potatoes; and what is material to you who have &s;o little ground, it will not require more than an eighth part of the ground which the four &s;acks will take. Par&s;nips are very good the &s;econd day warmed in-the frying-pan, and a little ra&s;her of pork or bacon will give them a nice flavour."</P>
<P>Dr. Shepherd now &s;aid, "as a proof of the nouri&s;hing quality of par&s;nips, I
<PB N="29" REF="28">was reading in a hi&s;tory book this very day, that the American Indians make a great part of their bread of par&s;nips, though Indian corn is &s;o famous: it will make a little variety too."</P>
<P>"I remember," &s;aid Mrs. White, "a cheap di&s;h, &s;o nice that it makes my mouth water. I peel &s;ome raw potatoes, &s;lice them thin, put the &s;lices into a deep frying-pan, or pot, with a little water, an onion, and a bit of pepper. Then I get a bone or two of a brea&s;t of mut|ton, or a little &s;trip of &s;alt pork, and put into it. Cover it down clo&s;e, keep in the &s;team, and let it &s;tew for an hour."</P>
<P>"You really get me an appetite, Mrs. White, by your dainty receipts," &s;aid the Doctor. "I am re&s;olved to have this di&s;h at my own table." "I could tell you another very good di&s;h, and &s;till cheaper," an&s;wered &s;he. "Come, let us have it," cried the Doctor. "I &s;hall write all down as &s;oon as I get home, and I will favour any body with a copy of the&s;e receipts who will call
<PB N="30" REF="29">at my hou&s;e." "And I will do more, Sir," &s;aid Mrs. White, "for I will put any of the&s;e women in the way how to dre&s;s it, the fir&s;t time, if they are at a lo&s;s. But this is my di&s;h.</P>
<P>"Take two or three pickled herrings, put them into a &s;tone jar, fill it up with potatoes, and a little water, and let it bake in the oven till it is done. I would give one hint more," added &s;he; "I have taken to u&s;e nothing but potatoe &s;tarch; and though I &s;ay it, that &s;hould not &s;ay it, nobody's linen in a common way looks better than ours."</P>
<P>The Doctor now &s;aid, "I am &s;orry for one hard&s;hip which many poor people labour under, I mean the difficulty of getting a little milk. I wi&s;h all farmers' wives were as con&s;iderate as you are, Mrs. White. A little milk is a great comfort to the poor, e&s;pecially when their children are &s;ick. And I have known it an&s;wer to the &s;eller as well as to the buyer, to keep a cow or two on purpo&s;e to &s;ell it out by the quart."</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="30">"Sir," &s;aid farmer White, "I beg leave to &s;ay a word to the men, if you plea&s;e, for all your advice goes to the women. If you will drink le&s;s Gin you may get more meat. If you ab&s;tain from the alehou&s;e you may many of you get a little one-way beer at home." "Aye, that we can Farmer," &s;aid poor Tom the thatcher, who was now got well. "Ea&s;ter Monday for that&mdash;I &s;ay no more.&mdash;A word to the wi&s;e." The Farmer &s;miled and went on. "The number of public hou&s;es in many a pari&s;h brings on more hunger and rags than all the taxes in it, heavy as they are. All the other evils put together hardly make up the &s;um of that one. We are now rai&s;ing a fre&s;h &s;ub&s;cription for you. This will be our rule of giving. We will not give to Sots, Gamblers, and Sabbath-breakers. Tho&s;e who do not &s;et their young children to work on week days, and &s;end them to &s;chool on Sundays, de&s;erve little favour. No man &s;hould keep a dog till he has more food than his family wants. If he feeds them at home they rob his chil|dren; if he &s;tarves them, they rob his neighbours. We have heard in a neigh|bouring
<PB N="32" REF="31">city that &s;ome people carried back the &s;ub&s;cription loaves becau&s;e they were too coar&s;e; but we hope better things of you." Here Betty Plane beg|ged, with all humility, to put in a word. "Certainly," &s;aid the Doctor, "we will li&s;ten to all mode&s;t complaints, and try to redre&s;s them. You were plea&s;ed to &s;ay, &s;ir," &s;aid &s;he, "that we might find much comfort from buying coar&s;e bits of beef. And &s;o we might, but you do not know, &s;ir, that we can &s;eldom get them, even when we had the money, and times were not &s;o bad." "How &s;o, Betty?" "Sir, when we go to butcher Jobbins for a bit of &s;hin, or any other lean piece, his an&s;wer is, 'You can't have it to-day. The cook at the great hou&s;e has be&s;poke it for gravy, or the Doctor's maid (beg|ging your pardon, &s;ir) has ju&s;t ordered it for &s;oup.' Now, &s;ir, if &s;uch kind gentle|folks were aware that this gravy and &s;oup, not only con&s;ume a great deal of meat, (which, to be &s;ure, tho&s;e have a right to u&s;e who can pay for it) but that it takes away tho&s;e coar&s;e pieces which the poor would buy, if they bought at all, I am &s;ure they would not do it.
<PB N="33" REF="32">For indeed the rich have been very kind, and I don't know what we &s;hould have done without them.</P>
<P>"I thank you for the hint Betty," &s;aid the Doctor, "and I a&s;&s;ure you I will have no more gravy &s;oup. My garden will &s;upply me with &s;oups, that are both whole&s;omer and better. And I will an&s;wer for my lady at the great hou&s;e that &s;he will do the &s;ame. I hope this will be|come a general rule, and then we &s;hall expect that the butchers will favour you in the prices of the coar&s;e pieces, if <HI>we</HI> buy nothing but the prime. In our gifts we &s;hall prefer, as the farmer has told you, tho&s;e who keep &s;teadily to their work: Such as come to the ve&s;try for a loaf, and do not come to church for the &s;ermon, we &s;hall mark; and prefer tho&s;e who come con&s;tantly whether there are any gifts or not. But there is one rule from which we will never depart. Tho&s;e who have been &s;een aiding or abetting any RIOT, any attack on butchers, bakers, wheat mows, mills, or millers, we will not relieve. With the quiet, contented, hard-working man, I will &s;hare my la&s;t
<PB N="34" REF="33">mor&s;el of bread. I &s;hall only add, that though it has plea&s;ed GOD to &s;end us this vi&s;itation as a puni&s;hment, yet we may convert this &s;hort trial into a la&s;ting ble&s;|&s;ing, if we all turn over a new leaf. Pro&s;|perity had made mo&s;t of us carele&s;s. The thoughtle&s;s profu&s;ion of &s;ome of the rich, could only be exceeded by the idle|ne&s;s and bad management of &s;ome of the poor. Let us now at la&s;t adopt that good old maxim, EVERY ONE MEND ONE. And may GOD add his ble&s;&s;ing!"</P>
<P>The people now cheerfully departed with their rice, re&s;olving, as many of them as could get milk, to put one of Mrs. White's receipts in practice that very night; and a rare &s;upper they had.</P>
<P>I hope &s;oon to give a good account how this pari&s;h improved in ea&s;e and comfort, by their improvement in fru|gality and good management.</P>
