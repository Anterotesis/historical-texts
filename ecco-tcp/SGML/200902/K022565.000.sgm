<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>TO be &s;tudious of bringing Merit in Ob&s;curity to Light, is &s;o &s;trong an In&s;tance of Benevolence, that it has in all Ages been con&s;tantly attended with the highe&s;t Commendations; while the De&s;troyer of a Man's Reputation (in what&s;oever it con&s;i&s;ted) has been ac|counted a more odious Criminal than even the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of his Body. On this Remark is founded one of the mo&s;t beau|tiful Pa&s;&s;ages in <HI>SHAKESPEARE:</HI></P>

<L><HI>Who &s;teals my Pur&s;e, &s;teals Tra&s;h;</HI></L>
<L><HI>'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been Slave to Thou&s;ands:</HI></L>
<L><HI>But he that filches from me my good Name,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Steals from me that which not enriches him,</HI></L>
<L><HI>But makes me poor indeed.</HI></L>
</LG>
<BIBL><HI>OTHELLO.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="4">
This is &s;o true an Ob&s;ervation, that few, I believe, will doubt, that <HI>MILTON</HI> was le&s;s offended at the low Price his ine&s;timable Poem was rated at on its fir&s;t Publication, than he would have been at the late mean Attempts to &s;ubvert a Fame &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>To view the Character of this <HI>SON OF DARKNESS</HI> in its mo&s;t genuine Form, let us contra&s;t it with another no le&s;s eminent for its Splendor, which is the propere&s;t I could chu&s;e for my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, as it is particularly &s;o in relation to that <HI>DIVINE AUTHOR</HI> we have lately &s;een &s;o well vindicat|ed from the groundle&s;s A&s;per&s;ions of almo&s;t his only Enemy.</P>
<P>In the Cour&s;e of the <HI>Spectators,</HI> Mr. <HI>ADDISON</HI> (who was perhaps the mo&s;t candid Critick that ever wrote, without de|viating from Impartiality) took a particular Plea&s;ure in producing latent unregarded Worth, that he might &s;how tho&s;e Cavillers who were daily complaining of a Deartb of good Poetry, what noble things of this Kind they neglected.</P>
<P>Agreeably to this End is his Critici&s;m on the <HI>old Engli&s;h Ballad of Chevy-Chace;</HI> but his mo&s;t glorious Works of this Kind are his Ob&s;ervations on the <HI>PARADISE LOST.</HI> There is not a &s;tronger In&s;tance of Prejudice, and the Force of Party, than the Reception this Poem met with in the Au|thor's Life-time, who&s;e unhappy Attachment to wrong
<PB N="vii" REF="5">
Principles, render'd all his Attempts at Fame (while liv|ing) fruitle&s;s. His admirable Poem lay in Ob&s;curity till Mr. <HI>ADDISON</HI> removed tho&s;e envious Clouds which had been &s;uffered to ob&s;truct its Splendor. With what Plea|&s;ure does be di&s;cover its Excellencies, and in&s;truct an or|dinary Reader to judge of its Beauties! With what Regret does he &s;peak of the &s;ew Blemi&s;hes of that Divine Piece, which (&s;ays he) <HI>is like writing a Treati&s;e upon the Spots of the Sun.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Remarks are &s;o univer&s;ally read and approved, that, I believe every body but <HI>LAUDER</HI> (and his Friends, if he has any) will concur with me in the following Ob&s;erva|tion: Had Mr. <HI>ADDISON</HI> never wrote a Line but his Cri|tique upon <HI>MILTON,</HI> that would alone have been &s;ufficient to have e&s;tabli&s;hed his Reputation as a fine Writer and a good Man.</P>
<P>If the Reader would view the exact Rever&s;e of the above Character, let him turn his Eyes on <HI>LAUDER:</HI> A Being &s;o utterly void of Candour and Benevolence, that he has thought it worth his While to commit the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Forgeries, to di|&s;turb, if po&s;&s;ible, the A&s;hes of our Poet, and has been more indu&s;trious to depreciate the <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t</HI> than the Writers in the Beginning of this Century were to heap Encomiums upon it. The Inhumanity and amazing Impudence of the&s;e Proceedings have puzzled all, to devi&s;e a likely Rea&s;on for &s;o
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
&s;trange a Piece of Malice. The faint Excu&s;es alledged for this Behaviour in <HI>LAUDER'S Recantation,</HI> by no Means pal|liate his Crime, notwith&s;tanding the florid Dre&s;s he has cloathed them in. Though I am far from being admitted into his &s;ecret Coun&s;els, I believe I may venture to mention one, which, out of his u&s;ual Regard to Truth, he has pur|po&s;ely omitted. It is very po&s;&s;ible the &s;ame thing which has often made Poets, tempted <HI>LAUDER</HI> to unmake one, <HI>viz.</HI> Poverty and the Hopes of a Sub&s;cription.</P>
<P>The&s;e potent Arguments once induced him to commend with &s;ome Warmth the very &s;ame Poem he has lately been at &s;o much Pains to brand, as a Work of no Genius: But as Hone&s;ty would no longer procure him a Dinner, his Con|&s;cience did not prevent him from turning the Tables.</P>
<Q><HI>Rem faciam Rem, Si po&s;&s;im, rect&egrave;, &s;i non, quocunque modo Rem.</HI></Q>
<P>But we will urge this no farther, remembering, that it is not right to &s;peak Ill of the <HI>Dead.</HI></P>
<P><HI>PREFACES</HI> are commonly intended for Di&s;cour&s;es to the Reader on the Book he is entering upon; but the Con&s;idera|tion of a Being quite dive&s;ted of Mode&s;ty and Humanity, na|turally led me into the foregoing Reflections, ari&s;ing from the Subject of the&s;e Sheets.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="7">
I &s;hall not trouble the Reader with an Account of the Time I was employed in writing it, or in&s;ipidly petition the Favour of the Criticks, but commit it to the World, 
<Q>With all its Imperfections on its Head.</Q></P>
<P>An Attempt to overthrow the bold A&s;&s;ertions of <HI>LAUDER</HI> by Poetry, till he had been foiled at his own Weapons, would hardly have &s;ucceeded. But when &s;o invincible a Champion as Mr. <HI>DOUGLAS</HI> had taken the Field, and returned victo|rious, the <HI>MUSES,</HI> who were particularly intere&s;ted in the Conte&s;t, &s;hould adorn him with the In&s;ignia of a Triumph.</P>
<P>This Hint has already given Ri&s;e to the <HI>Pandaemonium</HI> and the following Stanzas, in Imitation of <HI>SPENSER.</HI> The De&s;ign of our &s;everal Pieces are &s;o very different, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould cla&s;h in point of Merit. If we both meet with Succe&s;s, according to our various Models, we need not be di&s;heartened at any accidental Rival&s;hip or ab&s;urd Compari&s;on an injudicious Reader may draw be|tween us.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>DRYDEN,</HI> in &s;ome Part of his Works, has an Ob|&s;ervation hinting at <HI>Poetical Genealogy. We have among&s;t us</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>our Lines and De&s;cents, in as regular a man|ner as the noble&s;t Families.</HI> In deducing the be&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Writers from their poetick Original, he ob&s;erves, that <HI>MIL|TON</HI>
<PB N="x" REF="8">
is the fir&s;t De&s;cendant from <HI>SPENSER.</HI> This Remark of &s;o great a Judge as Mr. <HI>DRYDEN</HI> induced me to chu&s;e <HI>SPENSER</HI> for my Model, and to place him by the Side of <HI>APOLLO</HI> in my <HI>Poem,</HI> imagining there was a peculiar Pro|priety in &s;hielding the Son under the Protection of the Fa|ther.</P>
<P>As I did not &s;uppo&s;e that Imitations were bound to tran|&s;cribe the Faults as well as Excellencies of their Original, I made no Scruple of making a &s;light Alteration in <HI>SPENSER'S Stanza,</HI> which is univer&s;ally condemned for the Redun|dancy of its corre&s;pondent Rhimes. The Difficulty I &s;hould have found in the Execution had perhaps &s;ome Share in this voluntary Omi&s;&s;ion. Allowing this to be certain, my judi|cious Reader will be &s;o far from thinking it a Blemi&s;h, that I am per&s;uaded he will readily compound for the Lo&s;s of &s;ome of my Bells, provided I can entertain him more ra|tionally. I have, in general, rather wi&s;hed to fall into <HI>SPENSER</HI>'S Way of Thinking than his Manner of cloathing his Sentiments, becau&s;e I think his Imagery infinitely &s;upe|rior to his Stile. I have, however, be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n &s;o far from ne|glecting his Language, that except tho&s;e Places where I found the old Words expre&s;s le&s;s than the modern, I always gave them the Preference. Whether I have transfu&s;ed any of the divine Spirit of <HI>SPENSER</HI> into the following Stanzas, and whether his Style is &s;ucce&s;sfully imitated, the Reader mu&s;t judge for him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="9">
The Mention I made of the &s;light Variation from <HI>SPEN|SER</HI>'S Stanza, was meerly to prevent the Nibblers of the Age from imputing it to Ignorance. The&s;e would-be Cri|ticks take great Pains to pervert the Movements of the hu|man Mind, which certainly has more Plea&s;ure in be&s;towing Commendations than Di&s;prai&s;e. I beg Leave to &s;how the Truth of this A&s;&s;ertion by an In&s;tance drawn from my&s;elf as an Author. Whatever Satisfaction it may have afforded me to &s;tigmatize the Malice of <HI>LAUDER</HI>'S Proceedings, no|thing in the whole Cour&s;e of this Work plea&s;ed me &s;o much as celebrating Mr. <HI>DOUGLAS.</HI> If the following Trifle &s;hould meet with the Approbation of the Publick, I hope that Gentleman will think it an acceptable Pre&s;ent to Him&s;elf.</P>
