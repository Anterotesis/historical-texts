<P>IT has been &s;o hackney'd a practice for Authors to pretend that imperfect copies of their works had crept abroad, that the writer of the following Pa&s;toral is almo&s;t a&s;hamed to alledge this as the <HI>real</HI> cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent publication. This little poem was compo&s;ed &s;everal years ago (the Author's age eighteen) and recited at that Time, and &s;ince, by a party of young Ladies, for which purpo&s;e it was originally written; by this means, &s;ome mutilated copies were circulated, unknown to the Author, thro' many Hands.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS the following little poem turns chiefly on the danger of <HI>delay,</HI> or <HI>error,</HI> in the important article of <HI>Education;</HI> I know not to whom I can, with more propriety, dedicate it, than to you: as the &s;ubject it inculcates, has been one of the principal objects of your attention, in your own family. Let not the name of <HI>dedication</HI> alarm you; I am not going to offend by making your eulogium. Panegyric is only nece&s;&s;ary to &s;u&s;picious, or common characters. Virtue will not ac|cept it. Mode&s;ty will not offer it.</P>
<P>The friend&s;hip with which you have honor'd me from my very childhood, will, I flatter my&s;elf, be exerted in my favour on this occa&s;ion, and induce you to pardon
<PB REF="6">me for venturning, without your permi&s;&s;ion, to lay, before you this public te&s;timony of my e&s;teem, and to a&s;&s;ure you, how much I am,</P>
