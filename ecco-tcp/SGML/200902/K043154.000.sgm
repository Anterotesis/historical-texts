<P>THE &s;ubject of the following Farce is taken from the &s;econd part of D'Ur|&s;ey's Don Quixote. Three &s;cenes only of the original have been retained; and even the&s;e it was found nece&s;&s;ary to materially alter, and enrich with additions to give them a modern, a novel complexion.&mdash;Impre&s;&s;ed with every veneration for the genius of Cervantes, the pre&s;ent writer has adhered to him as clo&s;ely as the nature of dramatic writing would admit; and &s;hould the &s;ame of that celebrated wit protect San|cho on the &s;tage, the author of Barataria need not wr&s;h to be more &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANUEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>THIS is truly a curious whim of the Duke's to make Sancho a governor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pedro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I like the fancy of all things, and can antici|pate in idea laughter without end from it. Sudden ele|vation too often makes the wi&s;e man forget him&s;elf, and become ridiculous; now I &s;hall be glad to &s;ee what effect it will have upon a fool.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Manuel.</SPEAKER>
<P>The be&s;t of the joke is, old Rodriguez, her Grace's woman, takes every thing &s;eriou&s;ly; and is en|raged to &s;ee a fellow like Sancho Panca dignified with the title of governor, whil&s;t nothing is done for her after &s;o many years attendance on the Duche&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pedro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Arn't you to be continually about his per|&s;on?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Manuel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but the Duke has not yet given me my in&s;tru&s;tions in full. I wi&s;h you had over-heard Don Quixote this morning, admoni&s;hing Sancho for degrading his rank, by &s;cuffling with one of the grooms over the grid-iron, about a brown cru&s;t and a ra&s;her of bacon; He lookt as fierce as the knight of the burning &s;word, or the knight of the burning pe&s;tle, whil&s;t the chop-fallen Governor hung his head, as if he expected every minute to be cut into mince-meat, or pounded to a jelly. In pity to poor Sancho at la&s;t I interpo&s;ed, and re&s;cued his Excellency from a rib-roa&s;ting.</P>
</SP>

<PB N="6" REF="6">
<SPEAKER>Pedro.</SPEAKER>
<P>As I am known to have pickt up a &s;mattering of Latin, whil&s;t attending the Duke at Salamanca, I have been appointed &s;tate phy&s;ician to his Governor|&s;hip.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Manuel.</SPEAKER>
<P>The wor&s;t character you could have a&s;&s;umed to appear gracious in Sancho's eye; he has a mortal aver&s;ion to phy&s;icians and lawyers, &s;ince his beloved Dapple had like to have been killed by the quackery of a hor&s;e-doctor, and he him&s;elf ruined by the knavery of a petty-fogging attorney. I &s;hould not be &s;urprized if he commence his government by i&s;&s;uing a proclamation for the extinction of both profe&s;&s;ions, &s;entencing the members of each to hang up, and poi&s;on one another.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pedro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hi&s;tory &s;ays, the cackling of a goo&s;e &s;aved a whole nation in antient times, and may again in modern for ought we can tell to the contrary.</P>

<P>Illu&s;trious and renowned La Mancha, we hold our&s;elves much honor'd by your vi&s;it. Your re&s;olution &s;till to follow fortune, and add new laurels to your well won fame, we mu&s;t commend, however it afflicts us;&mdash;and be allured, the choice we have made of your faithful '&s;quire, to fill a po&s;t of honour, tru&s;t, and dignity, is chiefly owing to the high rank he has long held in your favour.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Grace is truly noble. My len&s;e of all your many favors tran&s;cends the power of utterance. I quit your territories, fill'd with &s;entiments of your Grace, &s;ublime and awful. My faithful Sancho, I am well a&s;|&s;ured, will never forfeit that confidence your Grace re|po&s;es

<P>Art thou now &s;atisfied, that through my means thou ha&s;t at la&s;t obtained thy long-lookt-for go|vernment?</P>

<P>I am, Sir; long-lookt-for come at la&s;t; bet|ter late than never; he who is ob&s;tinate &s;oon wears his coat threadbare; folly may hinder a man of many a good turn. I be&s;eech you, Sir, to pardon my proverbs, and thank the Duke there for his noble favour, which I do now re&s;olve to de&s;erve, by filling my place as well as I can.</P>

<P>I &s;ay in con&s;ideration of her &s;ex, and that it is her fir&s;t offence, we will not puni&s;h Rodriguez with that death, which &s;he &s;o ju&s;tly merits; but it is our high degree, that you in&s;tantly make proper conce&s;&s;ion to wipe off the ba&s;eaffront with which you have marked his countenance.</P>

<P>No more wipes, or marks, I be&s;eech your grace, from that lady in the countenance; however, le&s;t your grace &s;hou'd think me an ill-natured fellow, in con&s;ideration of Rodriguez's great age we forgive her.</P>

<P>I be&s;eech you, Sir, to &s;peak &s;lowly&mdash;that I may keep pace with you; you know my under&s;tanding was always more for the trot, than the gollop&mdash;and I am but a <HI>chicken</HI> of a governor yet you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Quixote.</SPEAKER>
<P>If thou would&s;t make thy&s;elf a proper governor, be careful of thy morals&mdash;to have, or to be thought to have morality, is extremely u&s;eful for a governor; if it were nothing but to be a &s;kreen, that people might not pry too curiou&s;ly into his conduct, and proceedings&mdash;not but that his actions ought to be &s;uch, as will bear the &s;tricte&s;t &s;crutiny&mdash;yet if he be once reputed a moral man, let him be a Turk in opi|nion, or religion, tis not three-half-pence matter&mdash;&s;econdly my Sancho.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sancho.</SPEAKER>
<P>That fir&s;tly, is a &s;pecial good law.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Quixote.</SPEAKER>
<P>Secondly I &s;ay a governor ought to have a nice, and tender con&s;cience; &s;o very &s;u&s;ceptible, a fly cannot buz near it, without making him &s;hrink.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sancho.</SPEAKER>
<P>It ought to &s;it tight, and clo&s;e to him; like a thimble, upon, the Duche&s;s's finger; not as I have heard it &s;its &s;ometimes; like a jockey's boot, that he can &s;tretch which way he plea&s;es.</P>

<P>Next be &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e not to forget thy original; nor blu&s;h to own thou com'&s;t of a mean extraction; for for when thou art not a&s;ham'd of it thy&s;elf, nobody will &s;eek to make thee &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sancho.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then, there will be no occa&s;ion to tell the people I was once a hog-driver.&mdash;Be&s;ides, when I have got the government, and am grown rich, nobody will trouble them&s;elves about what I was; daub your&s;elf over with honey, and you'll never want flies; <Q>what a man has, &s;o much he's &s;ure of.</Q>&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Quixote.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sancho, you mu&s;t be cautious not to overlaid thy di&s;cour&s;e with tho&s;e cur&s;ed proverbs; when
<PB N="11" REF="11">properly, and judiciou&s;ly u&s;ed, they enrich, and em|belli&s;h conver&s;ation; but thou bring&s;t 'em in &s;o by the head, and &s;houlders, that the purpo&s;e is defeated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sancho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ecod I believe, Sir, my mother longed for them; its a di&s;ea&s;e that heaven alone can cure me of; I have proverbs enough to fill a large &s;ack; and when I talk, they crowd &s;o thick to my mouth, that they quarrel which &s;hall get out fir&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Quixote.</SPEAKER>
<P>The next thing, Sancho, is to be cautious in your choice of officers of tru&s;t; remember you are but guardian of the <HI>people's trea&s;ure,</HI> and mu&s;t be careful to chu&s;e hone&s;t men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sancho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, ma&s;ter; but how am I to know them? after the &s;teed's &s;tol'n 'tis too late to &s;hut the &s;table door. I intend to act with <HI>certainty</HI> in this ca&s;e&mdash; and as I am &s;ure my people will not produce any man that's hone&s;ter than their governor, I will in&s;tantly ap|point <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> fir&s;t lord of the trea&s;ury of Barataria.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Quixote.</SPEAKER>
<P>In that ca&s;e, Sancho, I fear thy people will think thou ha&s;t not &s;o much di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, as thou ought'&s;t. Prudently examine what thy income may a|mount to in a year; then if thou can'&s;t afford four&s;core &s;ervants, keep but half, and what wou'd maintain the others, give to the poor, that their ble&s;&s;ings may ac|company thee wherever thou appear&s;t; in the execution of ju&s;tice, act with &s;trict impartiality; avoid, corrup|tion, or the taking of bribes; which is &s;o tempting, and withal &s;o crying a &s;in, there is not one governor in forty can forbear damning him&s;elf by it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sancho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, lord have mercy upon my &s;oul too; for to deal plainly I am afraid my fingers (as well as the re&s;t) will itch mo&s;t cur&s;edly to be handling the money. But, Sir, I hope, you'll allow there are per|qui&s;ites, which its fair a man &s;hould receive in all places; if it was not for the fees, &s;ome places wou'd not be worth the having; like the &s;auce, to certain meats, which &s;ometimes exceeds the di&s;h it&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Quixote.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wou'd not have thee, Sancho, when appointed a protector, turn out a &s;courge, and a tyrant; he flatters him&s;elf in vain with hopes of enjoying happi|ne&s;s, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of immen&s;e wealth, when obtain|ed
<PB N="12" REF="12">at the price of blood, and the tears and &s;ufferings of impoveri&s;hed provinces; it is true he may &s;ilence his accu&s;ers by rich pre&s;ents, and thus e&s;cape the &s;word of earth-born ju&s;tice; but guilt and remor&s;e will poi&s;on all his plea&s;ures, and tell him there is no blinding the eyes, or &s;taying the &s;word of divine vengeance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sancho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't you think, Sir, you have made this bribery bu&s;ine&s;s rather a little too long?&mdash;I'm afraid I &s;hall forget the be&s;t part of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Quixote.</SPEAKER>
<P>I could be &s;omewhat &s;atirical upon thy parts now, but that I love thee, Sancho, and therefore, will de&s;i&s;t; be&s;ides, to do thee ju&s;tice, thou art not the fir&s;t, who has had a government he was not beholden to his de&s;erts for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sancho.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. nor &s;han't be la&s;t, Sir; for de&s;ert is go|verned by fortune you know, and in a double manner; for if &s;ome were to have their true de&s;erts, they would be princes, and governors pre&s;ently; and if others, again were to have theirs, o'ons what an army of them would be hang'd up in one &s;ummer?</P>
