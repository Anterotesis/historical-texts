Such were the words of the Advocate Ne|mours to Pierre de la Motte, as the latter &s;tept at midnight into the carriage which was to bear him far from Paris, from his creditors and the per&s;ecution of the laws. De la Motte thanked him for this la&s;t in&s;tance of his kindne&s;s; the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he had given him in e&s;cape; and, when the carriage drove away, uttered a &s;ad adieu! The gloom of the hour, and the pecu|liar emergency of his circum&s;tances, &s;unk him in &s;ilent reverie.</P>
<P>Whoever has read Guyot de Pitaval, the mo&s;t faithful of tho&s;e writers who record the proceedings in the Parliamentary Courts of Paris, during the &s;eventeenth century, mu&s;t &s;urely remember the &s;triking &s;tory of Pierre de la Motte, and the Marquis Phillipe de Mon|talt: let all &s;uch, therefore, be informed, that the per&s;on here introduced to their notice was that individual Pierre de la Motte.</P>
<P>As Madame de la Motte leaned from the coach window, and gave a la&s;t look to the walls of Paris&mdash;Paris, the &s;cene of her former hap|pine&s;s, and the re&s;idence of many dear friends&mdash;the fortitude, which had till now &s;upported her, yielded to the force of grief. <Q REND="inline">"Farewell all!"</Q> &s;ighed &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"this la&s;t look and we are &s;eparated for ever!"</Q> Tears followed her words, and, &s;inking back, &s;he re&s;igned her&s;elf to the &s;tillne&s;s of &s;orrow. The recollection of former times pre&s;&s;ed heavily upon her heart: a few
<PB N="3" REF="5">
months before and &s;he was &s;urrounded by friends, fortune, and con&s;equence; now &s;he was deprived of all, a mi&s;erable exile from her native place, without home, without comfort&mdash;almo&s;t with|out hope. It was not the lea&s;t of her afflictions, that &s;he had been obliged to quit Paris, without bidding adieu to her only &s;on, who was now on duty with his regiment in Germany: and &s;uch had been the precipitancy of this removal, that had &s;he even known where he was &s;tationed, &s;he had no time to inform him of it, or of the alteration in his father's circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Pierre de la Motte was a gentleman, de&s;cended from an ancient hou&s;e of France. He was a man who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions often overcame his rea&s;on, and, for a time, &s;ilenced his con&s;cience; but, though the image of virtue, which Nature had impre&s;&s;ed upon his heart, was &s;ometimes ob&s;cured by the pa&s;&s;ing influence of vice, it was never wholly obliterated. With &s;trength of mind &s;ufficient to have with&s;tood temptation, he would have been a good man; as it was, he was always a weak, and &s;ometimes a vicious member of &s;ociety: yet his mind was active, and his imagination vivid, which, co-operating with the force of pa&s;&s;ion, often dazzled his judgment and &s;ubdued principle. Thus he was a man, infirm in purpo&s;e and vi&s;ionary in virtue: in a word, his conduct was &s;ugge&s;ted by feeling, rather than principle; and his virtue, &s;uch as it was, could not &s;tand the pre&s;&s;ure of occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6">
Early in life he had married Con&s;tance Va|lentia, a beautiful and elegant woman, attached to her family and beloved by them. Her birth was equal, her fortune &s;uperior to his; and their nuptials had been celebrated under the au&s;pices of an approving and flattering world. Her heart was devoted to La Motte, and, for &s;ome time, &s;he found in him an affectionate hu&s;band; but, allured by the gaieties of Paris, he was &s;oon devoted to its luxuries, and in a few years his fortune and affection were equally lo&s;t in di&s;&s;ipation. A fal&s;e pride had &s;till ope|rated again&s;t his intere&s;t, and withheld him from honourable retreat while it was yet in his power: the habits, which he had acquired, enchained him to the &s;cene of his former plea&s;ure; and thus he had continued an expen&s;ive &s;tile of life till the means of prolonging it were exhau&s;ted. He at length awoke from this lethargy of &s;ecu|rity; but it was only to plunge into new error, and to attempt &s;chemes for the reparation of his fortune, which &s;erved to &s;ink him deeper in de&s;truction. The con&s;equence of a tran&s;action, in which he thus engaged, now drove him, with the &s;mall wreck of his property, into dangerous and ignominious exile.</P>
<P>It was his de&s;ign to pa&s;s into one of the Southern Provinces, and there &s;eek, near the borders of the kingdom, an a&s;ylum in &s;ome ob&s;cure village. His family con&s;i&s;ted of his wife, and two faithful dome&s;tics, a man and
<PB N="5" REF="7">
woman, who followed the fortunes of their ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The night was dark and tempe&s;tuous, and, at about the di&s;tance of three leagues from Paris, Peter, who now acted as po&s;tillion, having drove for &s;ome time over a wild heath where many ways cro&s;&s;ed, &s;topped, and acquainted De la Motte with his perplexity. The &s;udden &s;topping of the carriage rou&s;ed the latter from his reverie, and filled the whole party with the terror of pur&s;uit; he was unable to &s;upply the nece&s;&s;ary direction, and the extreme darkne&s;s made it dangerous to proceed without one. During this period of di&s;tre&s;s, a light was per|ceived at &s;ome di&s;tance, and after much doubt and he&s;itation, La Motte, in the hope of ob|taining a&s;&s;i&s;tance, alighted and advanced towards it; he proceeded &s;lowly, from the fear of un|known pits. The light i&s;&s;ued from the window of a &s;mall and ancient hou&s;e, which &s;tood alone on the heath, at the di&s;tance of half a mile.</P>
<P>Having reached the door, he &s;topped for &s;ome moments, li&s;tening in apprehen&s;ive anxie|ty&mdash;no &s;ound was heard but that of the wind, which &s;wept in hollow gu&s;ts over the wa&s;te. At length he ventured to knock, and, having waited &s;ome time, during which he indi&s;tinctly heard &s;everal voices in conver&s;ation, &s;ome one within enquired what he wanted? La Motte an&s;wered, that he was a traveller who had lo&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="8">
his way, and de&s;ired to be directed to the neare&s;t town. <Q REND="inline">"That,"</Q> &s;aid the per&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"is &s;even miles off, and the road bad enough, even if you could &s;ee it: if you only want a bed, you may have it here, and had better &s;tay."</Q></P>
<P>The <Q REND="inline">"pitile&s;s pelting"</Q> of the &s;torm, which, at this time, beat with encrea&s;ing fury upon La Motte, inclined him to give up the attempt of proceeding farther till day-light; but, de&s;irous of &s;eeing the per&s;on with whom he conver&s;ed, before he ventured to expo&s;e his family by calling up the carriage, he a&s;ked to be admitted. The door was now opened by a tall figure with a light, who invited La Motte to enter. He followed the man through a pa&s;|&s;age into a room almo&s;t unfurni&s;hed, in one corner of which a bed was &s;pread upon the floor. The forlorn and de&s;olate a&s;pect of this apartment made La Motte &s;hrink involuntarily, and he was turning to go out when the man &s;uddenly pu&s;hed him back, and he heard the door locked upon him: his heart failed, yet he made a de&s;pcrate, though vain, effort to force the door, and called loudly for relea&s;e. No an&s;wer was returned; but he di&s;tingui&s;hed the voices of men in the room above, and, not doubting but their intention was to rob and murder him, his agitation, at fir&s;t, overcame his rea&s;on. By the light of &s;ome almo&s;t-ex|piring embers, he perceived a window, but the hope, which this di&s;covery revived, was quickly
<PB N="7" REF="9">
lo&s;t when he found the aperture guarded by &s;trong iron bars. Such preparation for &s;ecurity &s;urprized him, and confirmed his wor&s;t appre|hen&s;ions.&mdash;Alone, unarmed&mdash;beyond the chance of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he &s;aw him&s;elf in the power of people, who&s;e trade was apparently rapine!&mdash;murder their means!&mdash;After revolving every po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;cape, he endeavoured to await the event with fortitude; but La Motte could boa&s;t of no &s;uch virtue.</P>
<P>The voices had cea&s;ed, and all remained &s;till for a quarter of an hour, when, between the pau&s;es of the wind, he thought he di&s;tingui&s;hed the &s;obs and moaning of a female; he li&s;tened attentively and became confirmed in his con|jecture; it was too evidently the accent of di&s;tre&s;s. At this conviction, the remains of his courage for&s;ook him, and a terrible &s;urmi&s;e darted, with the rapidity of lightning, cro&s;s his brain. It was probable that his carriage had been di&s;covered by the people of the hou&s;e, who, with a de&s;ign of plunder, had &s;ecured his &s;ervant, and brought hither Madame de la Motte. He was the more inclined to believe this, by the &s;tillne&s;s which had, for &s;ome time, reigned in the hou&s;e, previous to the &s;ounds he now heard. Or it was po&s;&s;ible that the inha|bitants were not robbers, but per&s;ons to whom he had been betrayed by his friend or &s;ervant, and who were appointed to deliver him into the hands of ju&s;tice. Yet he hardly dared to doubt
<PB N="8" REF="10">
the integrity of his friend, who had been en|tru&s;ted with the &s;ecret of his flight and the plan of his route, and had procured him the carri|age in which he had e&s;caped. <Q REND="inline">"Such depra|vity,"</Q> exclaimed La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"cannot &s;urely exi&s;t in human nature; much le&s;s in the heart of Nemours!"</Q></P>
<P>This ejaculation was interrupted by a noi&s;e in the pa&s;&s;age leading to the room: it approached&mdash;the door was unlocked&mdash;and the man who had admitted La Motte into the hou&s;e entered, lea|ding, or rather forcibly dragging along, a beau|tiful girl, who appeared to be about eighteen. Her features were bathed in tears, and &s;he &s;eemed to &s;uffer the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s. The man fa&s;tened the lock and put the key in his pock|et. He then advanced to La Motte, who had before ob&s;erved other per&s;ons in the pa&s;&s;age, and pointing a pi&s;tol to his brea&s;t, <Q REND="inline">"You are wholly in our power,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"no a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance can reach you: if you wi&s;h to &s;ave your life, &s;wear that you will convey this girl where I may never &s;ee her more; or rather con&s;ent to take her with you, for your oath I would not believe, and I can take care you &s;hall not find me again.&mdash;An&s;wer quickly, you have no time to lo&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>He now &s;eized the trembling hand of the girl, who &s;hrunk agha&s;t with terror, and hurried her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">owards La Motte, whom &s;urprize &s;till kept &s;ilent. She &s;unk at his feet, and with &s;upplica|ting
<PB N="9" REF="11">
eyes, that &s;treamed with tears, implored him to have pity on her. Notwith&s;tanding his pre&s;ent agitation, he found it impo&s;&s;ible to con|template the beauty and di&s;tre&s;s of the object before him with indifference. Her youth, her apparent innocence&mdash;the artle&s;s energy of her manner forcibly a&s;&s;ailed his heart, and he was going to &s;peak, when the ruffian, who mi&s;took the &s;ilence of a&s;toni&s;hment for that of he&s;itation, prevented him. <Q REND="inline">"I have a hor&s;e ready to take you from hence,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"and I will di|rect you over the heath. If you return with|in an hour, you die: after then you are at liberty to come here when you plea&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>La Motte, without an&s;wering, rai&s;ed the lovely girl from the floor, and was &s;o much re|lieved from his own apprehen&s;ions, that he had lei&s;ure to attempt di&s;&s;ipating hers. <Q REND="inline">"Let us be gone,"</Q> &s;aid the ruffian, <Q REND="inline">"and have no more of this non&s;en&s;e; you may think your&s;elf well off it's no wor&s;e. I'll go and get the hor&s;e ready."</Q></P>
<P>The la&s;t words rou&s;ed La Motte, and per|plexed him with new fears; he dreaded to di&s;co|ver his carriage, le&s;t its appearance might tempt the banditti to plunder; and to depart on hor&s;e|back with this man might produce a con&s;equence yet more to be dreaded. Madame La Motte, wearied with apprehen&s;ion, would, probably, &s;end for her hu&s;band to the hou&s;e, when all the former danger would be incurred, with the addi|tional
<PB N="10" REF="12">
evil of being &s;eparated from his family, and the chance of being detected by the emi&s;&s;aries of ju&s;tice in endeavouring to recover them. As the&s;e reflections pa&s;&s;ed over his mind in tumultu|ous rapidity, a noi&s;e was again heard in the pa&s;|&s;age, an uproar and &s;cuffle en&s;ued, and in the &s;ame moment he could di&s;tingui&s;h the voice of his &s;ervant, who had been &s;ent by Madame La Motte in &s;earch of him. Being now determined to di&s;clo&s;e what could not long be concealed, he exclaimed aloud, that a hor&s;e was unnece&s;&s;ary, that he had a carriage at &s;ome di&s;tance which would convey them from the heath, the man, who was &s;eized, being his &s;ervant.</P>
<P>The ruffian, &s;peaking through the door, bid him be patient awhile and he &s;hould hear more from him. La Motte now turned his eyes upon his unfortunate companion, who, pale and ex|hau&s;ted, leaned for &s;upport again&s;t the wall. Her features, which were delicately beautiful, had gained from di&s;tre&s;s an expre&s;&s;ion of captiva|ting &s;weetne&s;s: &s;he had 
<Q><L>"An eye</L>
<L>"As when the blue &s;ky trembles thro' a cloud</L>
<L>"Of pure&s;t white."</L></Q> A habit of grey camlet, with &s;hort &s;la&s;hed &s;leeves, &s;hewed, but did not adorn, her figure: it was thrown open at the bo&s;om, upon which part of her hair had fallen in di&s;order, while the light veil ha&s;tily thrown on, had, in her confu&s;ion,
<PB N="11" REF="13">
been &s;uffered to fall back. Every moment of farther ob&s;ervation heightened the &s;urprize of La Motte, and intere&s;ted him more warmly in her favour. Such elegance and apparent refine|ment, contra&s;ted with the de&s;olation of the hou&s;e, and the &s;avage manners of its inhabitants, &s;eem|ed to him like a romance of imagination, rather than an occurrence of real life. He endeavoured to comfort her, and his &s;en&s;e of compa&s;&s;ion was too &s;incere to be mi&s;under&s;tood. Her terror gradually &s;ub&s;ided into gratitude and grief. <Q REND="inline">"Ah, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"Heaven has &s;ent you to my relief, and will &s;urely reward you for your protection: I have no friend in the world, if I do not find one in you."</Q></P>
<P>La Motte a&s;&s;ured her of his kindne&s;s, when he was interrupted by the entrance of the ruffian. He de&s;ired to be conducted to his family. <Q REND="inline">"All in good time,"</Q> replied the latter; <Q REND="inline">"I have taken care of one of them, and will of you, plea&s;e St. Peter; &s;o be comforted."</Q> The&s;e <HI>comfortable</HI> words renewed the terror of La Motte, who now earne&s;tly begged to know if his family were &s;afe. <Q REND="inline">"O! as for that matter they are &s;afe enough, and you will be with them pre&s;ently; but don't &s;tand <HI>parlying</HI> here all night. Do you chu&s;e to go or &s;tay? you know the conditions."</Q> They now bound the eyes of La Motte and of the young lady, whom terror had hitherto kept &s;ilent, and then placing them on two hor&s;es, a man mounted behind
<PB N="12" REF="14">
each, and they immediately gallopped off. They had proceeded in this way near half an hour, when La Motte entreated to know whi|ther he was going? <Q REND="inline">"You will know that bye and bye,"</Q> &s;aid the ruffian, <Q REND="inline">"&s;o be at peace."</Q> Finding interrogatories u&s;ele&s;s, La Motte re&s;u|med &s;ilence till the hor&s;es &s;topped. His con|ductor then hallooed, and being an&s;wered by voices at &s;ome di&s;tance, in a few moments the &s;ound of carriage wheels was heard, and, pre|&s;ently after, the words of a man directing Peter which way to drive. As the carriage approach|ed, La Motte called, and to his inexpre&s;&s;ible joy, was an&s;wered by his wife.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are now beyond the borders of the heath, and may go which way you will,"</Q> &s;aid the ruffian; <Q REND="inline">"if you return within an hour, you will be welcomed by a brace of bullets."</Q> This was a very unnece&s;&s;ary caution to La Motte, whom they now relea&s;ed. The young &s;tranger &s;ighed deeply, as &s;he entered the carri|age; and the ruffian, having be&s;towed upon Peter &s;ome directions and more threats, waited to &s;ee him drive off. They did not wait long.</P>
<P>La Motte immediately gave a &s;hort relation of what had pa&s;&s;ed at the hou&s;e, including an account of the manner in which the young &s;tran|ger had been introduced to him. During this narrative, her deep convul&s;ive &s;ighs frequently drew the attention of Madame La Motte, who&s;e compa&s;&s;ion became gradually intere&s;ted in her
<PB N="13" REF="15">
behalf, and who now endeavoured to tranquil|lize her &s;pirits. The unhappy girl an&s;wered her kindne&s;s in artle&s;s and &s;imple expre&s;&s;ions, and then relap&s;ed into tears and &s;ilence. Madame forbore for the pre&s;ent to a&s;k any que&s;tions that might lead to a di&s;covery of her connections, or &s;eem to require an explanation of the late ad|venture, which now furni&s;hing her with a new &s;ubject of reflection, the &s;en&s;e of her own mi&s;|fortunes pre&s;&s;ed le&s;s heavily upon her mind. The di&s;tre&s;s of La Motte was even for a while &s;u&s;pended; he ruminated on the late &s;cene, and it appeared like a vi&s;ion, or one of tho&s;e improbable fictions that &s;ometimes are exhibited in a romance: he could reduce it to no princi|ples of probability, or render it comprehen&s;ible by any endeavour to analize it. The pre&s;ent charge, and the chance of future trouble brought upon him by this adventure, occa&s;ioned &s;ome di&s;&s;atisfaction; but the beauty and &s;eeming in|nocence of Adeline, united with the pleadings of humanity in her favour, and he determined to protect her.</P>
<P>The tumult of emotions which had pa&s;&s;ed in the bo&s;om of Adeline, began now to &s;ub&s;ide; terror was &s;oftened into anxiety, and de&s;pair into grief. The &s;ympathy &s;o evident in the manners of her companions, particularly in tho&s;e of Ma|dame La Motte, &s;oothed her heart and encou|raged her to hope for better days.</P>
<P>Di&s;mally and &s;ilently the night pa&s;&s;ed on, for
<PB N="14" REF="16">
the minds of the travellers were too much oc|cupied by their &s;everal &s;ufferings to admit of conver&s;ation. The dawn, &s;o anxiou&s;ly watched for, at length appeared, and introduced the &s;trangers more fully to each other. Adeline de|rived comfort from the looks of Madame La Motte, who gazed frequently and attentively at her, and thought &s;he had &s;eldom &s;een a counte|nance &s;o intere&s;ting, or a form &s;o &s;triking. The languor of &s;orrow threw a melancholy grace upon her features, that appealed immediately to the heart; and there was a penetrating &s;weet|ne&s;s in her blue eyes, which indicated an intel|ligent and amiable mind.</P>
<P>La Motte now looked anxiou&s;ly from the coach window, that he might judge of their &s;i|tuation, and ob&s;erve whether he was followed. The ob&s;curity of the dawn confined his views, but no per&s;on appeared. The &s;un at length tin|ted the ea&s;tern clouds and the tops of the highe&s;t hills, and &s;oon after bur&s;t in full &s;plendour on the &s;cene. The terrors of La Motte began to &s;ub&s;ide, and the griefs of Adeline to &s;often. They entered upon a lane confined by high banks and over-arched by trees, on who&s;e bran|ches appeared the fir&s;t green buds of &s;pring glittering with dews. The fre&s;h breeze of the morning animated the &s;pirits of Adeline, who&s;e mind was delicately &s;en&s;ible to the beauties of na|ture. As &s;he viewed the flowery luxuriance of the turf, and the tender green of the trees, or
<PB N="15" REF="17">
caught, between the opening banks, a glimp&s;e of the varied land&s;cape, rich with wood, and fading into blue and di&s;tant mountains, her heart expanded in momentary joy. With Adeline the charms of external nature were heightened by tho&s;e of novelty: &s;he had &s;eldom &s;een the grandeur of an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect, or the mag|nificence of a wide horizon&mdash;and not often the picture&s;que beauties of more confined &s;cenery. Her mind had not lo&s;t by long oppre&s;&s;ion that ela&s;tic energy, which re&s;i&s;ts calamity; el&s;e, however &s;u&s;ceptible might have been her original ta&s;te, the beauties of nature would no longer have charmed her thus ea&s;ily even to temporary re|po&s;e.</P>
<P>The road, at length, wound down the &s;ide of a hill, and La Motte, again looking anxi|ou&s;ly from the window, &s;aw before him an open champaign country, through which the road, wholly un&s;heltered from ob&s;ervation, extended al|mo&s;t in a direct line. The danger of the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances alarmed him, for his flight might without difficulty be traced for many leagues from the hills he was now de&s;cending. Of the fir&s;t pea&s;ant that pa&s;&s;ed, he inquired for a road among the hills, but heard of none. La Motte now &s;unk into his former terrors. Madame, not|with&s;tanding her own apprehen&s;ions, endeavour|ed to re-a&s;&s;ure him, but finding her efforts inef|fectual, &s;he al&s;o retired to the contemplation of her misfortunes. Often, as they went on, did

La Motte look back upon the country they had pa&s;&s;ed, and often did imagination &s;ugge&s;t to him the &s;ounds of di&s;tant pur&s;uits.</P>
<P>The travellers &s;topped to breakfa&s;t in a vil|lage, where the road was at length ob&s;cured by woods, and La Motte's &s;pirits again revived. Adeline appeared more tranquil than &s;he had yet been, and La Motte now a&s;ked for an explana|tion of the &s;cene be had witne&s;&s;ed on the pre|ceding night. The inquiry renewed all her di&s;tre&s;s, and with tears &s;he entreated for the pre&s;ent to be &s;pared on the &s;ubject. La Motte pre&s;&s;ed it no farther, but he ob&s;erved that for the greater part of the day &s;he &s;eemed to remem|ber it in melancholy and dejection. They now travelled among the hills and were, therefore, in le&s;s danger of ob&s;ervation; but La Motte avoid|ed the great towns, and &s;topped in ob&s;cure ones no longer than to refre&s;h the hor&s;es. About two hours after noon, the road wound into a deep valley, watered by a rivulet, and over-hung with wood. La Motte called to Peter, and or|dered him to drive to a thickly embowered &s;pot, that appeared on the left. Here he alighted with his family, and Peter having &s;pread the provi|&s;ions on the turf, they &s;eated them&s;elves and par|took of a repa&s;t, which, in other circum&s;tances, would have been thought delicious. Adeline en|deavoured to &s;mile, but the languor of grief was now heightened by indi&s;po&s;ition. The violent a|gitation of mind, and fatigue of body, which &s;he
<PB N="17" REF="19">
had &s;uffered for the la&s;t twenty-four hours, had overpowered her &s;trength, and, when La Mot|te led her back to the carriage, her whole frame trembled with illne&s;s. But &s;he uttered no com|plaint, and, having long ob&s;erved the dejection of her companions, &s;he made a feeble effort to enliven them.</P>
<P>They continued to travel throughout the day without any accident or interruption, and, about three hours after &s;un&s;et, arrived at Monville, a &s;mall town where La Motte determined to pa&s;s the night. Repo&s;e was, indeed nece&s;&s;ary to the whole party, who&s;e pale and haggard looks, as they alighted from the carriage, were but too obvious to pa&s;s unob&s;erved by the people of the inn. As &s;oon as the beds could be prepared, Adeline withdrew to her chamber, accompa|nied by Madame La Motte, who&s;e concern for the fair &s;tranger made her exert every effort to &s;oothe and con&s;ole her. Adeline wept in &s;ilence, and taking the hand of Madame, pre&s;&s;ed it to her bo&s;om. The&s;e were not merely tears of grief&mdash;they were mingled with tho&s;e which flow from the grateful heart, when, unexpectedly, it meets with &s;ympathy. Madame La Motte un|der&s;tood them. After &s;ome momentary &s;ilence &s;he renewed her a&s;&s;urances of kindne&s;s, and en|treated Adeline to confide in her friend&s;hip; but &s;he carefully avoided any mention of the &s;ubject, which had before &s;o much affected her. Adeline at length found words to expre&s;s her &s;en&s;e of
<PB N="18" REF="20">
this goodne&s;s, which &s;he did in a manner &s;o na|tural and &s;incere, that Madame, finding her|&s;elf much affected, took leave of her for the night.</P>
<P>In the morning, La Motte ro&s;e at an early hour, impatient to be gone. Every thing was prepared for his departure, and the breakfa&s;t had been waiting &s;ome time, but Adeline did not ap|pear. Madame La Motte went to her chamber, and found her &s;unk in a di&s;turbed &s;lumber. Her breathing was &s;hort and irregular&mdash;&s;he frequently &s;tarted, or &s;ighed, and &s;ometimes &s;he muttered an incoherent &s;entence. While Madame gazed with concern upon her languid countenance, &s;he awoke, and looking up, gave her hand to Madame La Motte, who found it burning with fever. She had pa&s;&s;ed a re&s;tle&s;s night, and, as &s;he now attempted to ri&s;e, her head, which beat with inten&s;e pain, grew gid|dy, her &s;trength failed, and &s;he &s;unk back.</P>
<P>Madame was much alarmed, being at once convinced that it was impo&s;&s;ible &s;he could tra|vel, and that a delay might prove fatal to her hu&s;band. She went to inform him of the truth, and his di&s;tre&s;s may be more ea&s;ily imagined than de&s;cribed. He &s;aw all the inconvenience and danger of delay, yet he could not &s;o far dive&s;t him&s;elf of humanity, as to abandon A|deline to the care, or rather, to the neglect of &s;trangers. He &s;ent immediately for a phy&s;ici|an, who pronounced her to be in a high fe|ver,
<PB N="19" REF="21">
and &s;aid, a removal in her pre&s;ent &s;tate mu&s;t be fatal. La Motte now determined to wait the event, and endeavoured to calm the tran&s;ports of terror, which, at times, a&s;&s;ailed him. In the mean while, he took &s;uch pre|cautions as his &s;ituation admitted of, pa&s;&s;ing the greater part of the day out of the village, in a &s;pot from whence he had a view of the road for &s;ome di&s;tance; yet to be expo&s;ed to de&s;truction by the illne&s;s of a girl, whom he did not know, and who had actually been for|ced upon him, was a misfortune, to which La Motte had not philo&s;ophy enough to &s;ub|mit with compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>Adeline's fever continued to increa&s;e during the whole day, and at night, when the phy&s;i|cian took his leave, he told La Motte, the e|vent would very &s;oon be decided. La Mot|te received this intelligence with real concern. The beauty and innocence of Adeline had over|come the di&s;advantageous circum&s;tances under which &s;he had been introduced to him, and he now gave le&s;s con&s;ideration to the inconve|nience &s;he might hereafter occa&s;ion him, than to the hope of her recovery.</P>
<P>Madame La Motte watched over her with tender anxiety, and ob&s;erved with admiration her patient &s;weetne&s;s and mild re&s;ignation. Adeline amply repaid her, though &s;he thought &s;he could not. <Q REND="inline">"Young as I am,"</Q> &s;he would &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"and de&s;erted by tho&s;e upon whom I
<PB N="20" REF="22">
have a claim for protection, I can remem|ber no connection to make me regret life &s;o much, as that I hoped to form with you. If I live, my conduct will be&s;t expre&s;s my &s;en&s;e of your goodne&s;s;&mdash;words are but fee|ble te&s;timonies."</Q></P>
<P>The &s;weetne&s;s of her manners &s;o much at|tracted Madame La Motte, that &s;he watched the cri&s;is of her di&s;order, with a &s;olicitude which precluded every other intere&s;t. Adeline pa&s;&s;ed a very di&s;turbed night, and, when the phy&s;ician appeared in the morning, he gave orders that &s;he &s;hould be indulged with whatever &s;he liked, and an&s;wered the inquiries of La Motte with a frankne&s;s that left him nothing to hope.</P>
<P>In the mean time, his patient, after drinking profu&s;ely of &s;ome mild liquids, fell a&s;leep, in which &s;he continued for &s;everal hours, and &s;o profound was her repo&s;e, that her breath alone gave &s;ign of exi&s;tence. She awoke free from fever, and with no other di&s;order than weak|ne&s;s, which, in a few days, &s;he overcame &s;o well, as to be able to &s;et out with La Motte for B&mdash;, a village out of the great road, which he thought it prudent to quit. There they pa&s;|&s;ed the following night, and early the next morn|ing commenced their journey upon a wild and woody tract of country. They &s;topped about noon at a &s;olitary village, where they took re|fre&s;hments, and obtained directions for pa&s;&s;ing the va&s;t fore&s;t of Fontanville, upon the borders
<PB N="21" REF="23">
of which they now were. La Motte wi&s;hed at fir&s;t to take a guide, but he apprehended more evil from the di&s;covery he might make of his route, than he hoped for benefit from a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the wilds of this uncultivated tract.</P>
<P>La Motte now de&s;igned to pa&s;s on to Lyons, where he could either &s;eek concealment in its neighbourhood, or embark on the Rhone for Geneva, &s;hould the emergency of his circum|&s;tances hereafter require him to leave France. It was about twelve o'clock at noon, and he was de&s;irous to ha&s;ten forward, that he might pa&s;s the fore&s;t of Fontanville, and reach the town on its oppo&s;ite borders, before night-fall. Having depo&s;ited a fre&s;h &s;tock of provi&s;ions in the carri|age, and received &s;uch directions as were nece&s;|&s;ary concerning the roads, they again &s;et forward, and in a &s;hort time entered upon the fore&s;t. It was now the latter end of April, and the wea|ther was remarkably temperate and fine. The balmy fre&s;hne&s;s of the air, which breathed the fir&s;t pure e&s;&s;ence of vegetation; and the gentle warmth of the &s;un, who&s;e beams vivified every hue of nature, and opened every floweret of &s;pring, revived Adeline, and in&s;pired her with life and health. As &s;he inhaled the breeze, her &s;trength &s;eemed to return, and, as her eyes wandered through the romantic glades that opened into the fore&s;t, her heart was gladdened with complacent delight: but when from the&s;e objects &s;he turned her regard upon Mon&s;ieur and
<PB N="22" REF="24">
Madame La Motte, to who&s;e tender attentions &s;he owed her life, and in who&s;e looks &s;hew now read e&s;teem and kindne&s;s, her bo&s;om glowed with &s;weet affections, and &s;he experienced a force of gratitude which might be called &s;ub|lime.</P>
<P>For the remainder of the day they conti|nued to travel, without &s;eeing a hut, or meet|ing a human being. It was now near &s;un-&s;et, and, the pro&s;pect being clo&s;ed on all &s;ides by the fore&s;t, La Motte began to have apprehen&s;ions that his &s;ervant had mi&s;taken the way. The road, if a road it could be called, which affor|ded only a &s;light track upon the gra&s;s, was &s;ometimes over-run by luxuriant vegetation, and &s;ometimes ob&s;cured by the deep &s;hades, and Peter at length &s;topped uncertain of the way. La Motte, who dreaded being benighted in a &s;cene &s;o wild and &s;olitary as this fore&s;t, and who&s;e apprehen&s;ions of banditti were very &s;an|guine, ordered him to proceed at any rate, and, if he found no track, to endeavour to gain a more open part of the fore&s;t. With the&s;e or|ders, Peter again &s;et forwards, but having pro|ceeded &s;ome way, and his views being &s;till con|fined by woody glades and fore&s;t walks, he be|gan to de&s;pair of extricating him&s;elf, and &s;top|ped for further orders. The &s;un was now &s;et, but, as La Motte looked anxiou&s;ly from the window, he ob&s;erved upon the vivid glow of the we&s;tern horizon, &s;ome dark towers ri&s;ing
<PB N="23" REF="25">
from among the trees at a little di&s;tance, and ordered Peter to drive towards them. <Q REND="inline">"If they belong to a mona&s;tery,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"we may probably gain admittance for the night."</Q></P>
<P>The carriage drove along under the &s;hade of <Q REND="inline">"melancholy boughs,"</Q> through which the even|ing twilight, which yet coloured the air, diffu|&s;ed a &s;olemnity that vibrated in thrilling &s;en&s;ati|tions upon the hearts of the travellers. Expec|tation kept them &s;ilent. The pre&s;ent &s;cene re|called to Adeline a remembrance of the late ter|rific circum&s;tances, and her mind re&s;ponded but too ea&s;ily to the apprehen&s;ion of new misfor|tunes. La Motte alighted at the foot of a green knoll, where the trees again opening to light, permitted a nearer, though imperfect view of the edifice.</P>

<P>HE approached, and perceived the Gothic remains of an abbey: it &s;tood on a kind of rude lawn, over&s;hadowed by high and &s;preading trees, which &s;eemed coeval with the building, and diffu&s;ed a romantic gloom around. The great|er part of the pile appeared to be &s;inking into ruins, and that, which had with&s;tood the rava|ges of time, &s;hewed the remaining features of the fabric more awful in decay. The lofty bat|tlements, thickly enwreathed with ivy, were half demoli&s;hed, and become the re&s;idence of birds of prey. Huge fragments of the ea&s;tern tower, which was almo&s;t demoli&s;hed, lay &s;cat|tered amid the high gra&s;s, that waved &s;lowly to the breeze. <Q REND="inline">"The thi&s;tle &s;hook its lonely head; the mo&s;s whi&s;tled to the wind."</Q> A Gothic

gate, richly ornamented with fret-work, which opened into the main body of the edifice, but which was now ob&s;tructed with bru&s;h-wood, remained entire. Above the va&s;t and magnifi|cent portal of this gate aro&s;e a window of the &s;ame order, who&s;e pointed arches &s;till exhibited fragments of &s;tained gla&s;s, once the pride of monki&s;h devotion. La Motte, thinking it po&s;|&s;ible it might yet &s;helter &s;ome human being, ad|vanced to the gate and lifted a ma&s;&s;y knocker. The hollow &s;ounds rung through the emptine&s;s of the place. After waiting a few minutes, he forced back the gate, which was heavy with iron work, and creaked har&s;hly on its hinges.</P>
<P>He entered what appeared to have been the chapel of the abbey, where the hymn of devo|tion had once been rai&s;ed, and the tear of pe|nitence had once been &s;hed; &s;ounds, which could now only be recalled by imagination&mdash;tears of penitence, which had been long &s;ince fixed in fate. La Motte pau&s;ed a moment, for he felt a &s;en&s;ation of &s;ublimity ri&s;ing into terror&mdash;a &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion of mingled a&s;toni&s;hment and awe! He &s;urveyed the va&s;tne&s;s of the place, and as he contemplated its ruins, fancy bore him back to pa&s;t ages. <Q REND="inline">"And the&s;e walls,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"where once &s;uper&s;tition lurked, and au&s;terity anti|cipated an earthly purgatory, now tremble over the mortal remains of the beings who reared them!"</Q></P>
<P>The deepening gloom now reminded La
<PB N="26" REF="28">
Motte that he had no time to lo&s;e, but curio&s;ity prompted him to explore farther, and he obey|ed the impul&s;e. As he walked over the broken pavement, the &s;ound of his &s;teps ran in echoes through the place, and &s;eemed like the my&s;teri|ous accents of the dead, reproving the &s;acrile gi|ous mortal who thus dared to di&s;turb their pre|cincts.</P>
<P>From this chapel he pa&s;&s;ed into the nave of the great church, of which one window, more perfect than the re&s;t, opened upon a long vi&s;ta of the fore&s;t, through which was &s;een the rich colouring of evening, melting by imperceptible gradations into the &s;olemn grey of upper air. Dark hills, who&s;e outline appeared di&s;tinct upon the vivid glow of the horizon, clo&s;ed the per|&s;pective. Several of the pillars, which had once &s;upported the roof, remained the proud effigies of &s;inking greatne&s;s, and &s;eemed to nod at every murmur of the bla&s;t over the fragments of tho&s;e that had fallen a little before them. La Motte &s;ighed. The compari&s;on between him&s;elf and the gradation of decay, which the&s;e columns ex|hibited, was but too obvious and affecting. <Q REND="inline">"A few years,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"and I &s;hall become like the mortals on who&s;e reliques I now gaze, and, like them too, I may be the &s;ubject of meditation to a &s;ucceeding generation, which &s;hall totter but a little while over the object they contemplate, ere they al&s;o &s;ink into the du&s;t."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="29">
Retiring from this &s;cene, he walked through the cloi&s;ters, till a door, which communicated with the lofty part of the building, attracted his curio&s;ity. He opened this and perceived, acro&s;s the foot of the &s;tair-ca&s;e, another door,&mdash;but now, partly checked by fear, and partly by the recol|lection of the &s;urprize his family might feel in his ab&s;ence, he returned with ha&s;ty &s;teps to his carriage, having wa&s;ted &s;ome of the precious moments of twilight, and gained no informa|tion.</P>
<P>Some &s;light an&s;wer to Madame La Motte's inquiries, and a general direction to Peter to drive carefully on, and look for a road, was all that his anxiety would permit him to utter. The night &s;hade fell thick round, which deep|ened by the gloom of the fore&s;t, &s;oon rendered it dangerous to proceed. Peter &s;topped, but La Motte, per&s;i&s;ting in his fir&s;t determination, ordered him to go on. Peter ventured to remon|&s;trate, Madame La Motte entreated, but La Motte reproved&mdash;commanded, and at length re|pented; for the hind wheel ri&s;ing upon the &s;tump of an old tree, which the darkne&s;s had prevented Peter from ob&s;erving, the carriage was in an in&s;tant overturned.</P>
<P>The party, as may be &s;uppo&s;ed, were much terrified, but no one was materially hurt, and having di&s;engaged them&s;elves from their perilous &s;ituation, La Motte and Peter endeavoured to rai&s;e the carriage. The extent of this misfor|tune
<PB N="28" REF="30">
was now di&s;covered, for they perceived that the wheel was broke. Their di&s;tre&s;s was rea&s;onably great, for not only was the coach di&s;abled from proceeding, but it could not even afford a &s;helter from the cold dews of the night, it being impo&s;&s;ible to pre&s;erve it in an upright &s;ituation. After a few moment's &s;ilence, La Motte propo&s;ed that they &s;hould return to the ruins which they had ju&s;t quitted, which lay at a very &s;hort di&s;tance, and pa&s;s the night in the mo&s;t habitable part of them: that, when morn|ing dawned, Peter &s;hould take one of the coach hor&s;es, and endeavour to find a road and a town, from whence a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;hould be procured for repairing the carriage. This propo&s;al was op|po&s;ed by Madame La Motte, who &s;huddered at the idea of pa&s;&s;ing &s;o many hours of darkne&s;s in a place &s;o forlorn as the mona&s;tery. Terrors which &s;he neither endeavoured to examine, or combat, overcame her, and &s;he told La Motte &s;he had rather remain expo&s;ed to the unwhole|&s;ome dews of night, than encounter the de&s;o|lation of the ruins. La Motte had at fir&s;t felt an equal reluctance to return to this &s;pot, but having &s;ubdued his own feelings, he re&s;olved not to yield to tho&s;e of his wife.</P>
<P>The hor&s;es being now di&s;engaged from the carriage, the party moved towards the edifice. As they proceeded, Peter, who followed them, &s;truck a light, and they entered the ruins by the flame of &s;ticks, which he had collected.
<PB N="29" REF="31">
The partial gleams thrown acro&s;s the fabric &s;eemed to make its de&s;olation more &s;olemn, while the ob&s;curity of the greater part of the pile heightened its &s;ublimity, and led fancy on to &s;cenes of horror. Adeline who had hitherto remained in &s;ilence, now uttered an exclamation of mingled admiration and fear. A kind of plea&s;ing dread thrilled her bo&s;om, and filled all her &s;oul. Tears &s;tarted into her eyes:&mdash;&s;he wi&s;hed, yet feared, to go on;&mdash;&s;he hung upon the arm of La Motte, and looked at him with a &s;ort of he&s;itating interrogation.</P>
<P>He opened the door of the great hall, and they entered: its extent was lo&s;t in gloom. <Q REND="inline">"Let us &s;tay here,"</Q> &s;aid Madame de la Motte, <Q REND="inline">"I will go no farther."</Q> La Motte pointed to the broken roof, and was proceeding, when he was interrupted by an uncommon noi&s;e, which pa&s;&s;ed along the hall. They were all &s;ilent&mdash;it was the &s;ilence of terror. Madame La Motte &s;poke fir&s;t. <Q REND="inline">"Let us quit this &s;pot,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"any evil is preferable to the feeling, which now oppre&s;&s;es me. Let us retire in&s;tantly."</Q> The &s;tillne&s;s had for &s;ome time remained un|di&s;turbed, and La Motte, a&s;hamed of the fear he had involuntarily betrayed, now thought it nece&s;&s;ary to affect a boldne&s;s, which he did not feel. He, therefore, oppo&s;ed ridicule to the terror of Madame, and in&s;i&s;ted upon proceeding. Thus compelled to acquie&s;ce, &s;he traver&s;ed the hall with trembling &s;teps. They came to a
<PB N="30" REF="32">
narrow pa&s;&s;age, and Peter's &s;ticks being nearly exhau&s;ted, they awaited here, while he went in &s;earch of more.</P>
<P>The almo&s;t expiring light fla&s;hed faintly upon the walls of the pa&s;&s;age, &s;hewing the rece&s;s more horrible. Acro&s;s the hall, the greater part of which was concealed in &s;hadow, the feeble ray &s;pread a tremulous gleam, exhibiting the cha&s;m in the roof, while many namele&s;s objects were &s;een imperfectly through the du&s;k. Adeline with a &s;mile, inquired of La Motte, if he believed in &s;pirits. The que&s;tion was ill-timed, for the pre&s;ent &s;cene impre&s;&s;ed its terrors upon La Motte, and, in &s;pite of endeavour, he felt a &s;uper&s;titious dread &s;tealing upon him. He was now, perhaps, &s;tanding over the a&s;hes of the dead. If &s;pirits were ever permitted to revi&s;it the earth, this &s;eemed the hour and the place mo&s;t &s;uitable for their appearance. La Motte remaining &s;ilent, Adeline &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Were I in|clined to &s;uper&s;tition"&mdash;</Q>She was interrupted by a return of the noi&s;e, which had been lately heard. It &s;ounded down the pa&s;&s;age, at who&s;e entrance they &s;tood, and &s;unk gradually away. Every heart palpitated, and they remained li&s;|tening in &s;ilence. A new &s;ubject of apprehen&s;ion &s;eized La Motte:&mdash;the noi&s;e might proceed from banditti, and he he&s;itated whether it would be &s;afe to proceed. Peter now came with the light: Madame refu&s;ed to enter the pa&s;&s;age&mdash;La Motte was not much inclined to it; but
<PB N="31" REF="33">
Peter, in whom curio&s;ity was more prevalent than fear, readily offered his &s;ervices. La Motte, after &s;ome he&s;itation, &s;uffered him to go, while he awaited at the entrance the re&s;ult of the enquiry. The extent of the pa&s;&s;age &s;oon concealed Peter from view, and the echoes of his foot&s;teps were lo&s;t in a &s;ound, which ru&s;hed along the avenue, and became fainter and faint|er, till it &s;unk into &s;ilence. La Motte now called aloud to Peter, but no an&s;wer was re|turned; at length, they heard the &s;ound of a di&s;tant foot&s;tep, and Peter &s;oon after appeared, breathle&s;s, and pale with fear.</P>
<P>When he came within hearing of La Motte, he called out, <Q REND="inline">"An plea&s;e your honour, I've done for them, I believe, but I've had a hard bout. I thought I was fighting with the de|vil."&mdash;</Q> <Q REND="inline">"What are you &s;peaking of?"</Q> &s;aid La Motte.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"They were nothing but owls and rooks after all,"</Q> continued Peter; <Q REND="inline">"but the light brought them all about my ears, and they made &s;uch a confounded clapping with their wings, that I thought at fir&s;t I had been be&s;et with a legion of devils. But I have drove them all out, ma&s;ter, and you have nothing to fear now."</Q></P>
<P>The latter part of the &s;entence, intimating a &s;u&s;picion of his courage, La Motte could have di&s;pen&s;ed with, and, to retrieve in &s;ome degree his reputation, he made a point of proceeding
<PB N="32" REF="34">
through the pa&s;&s;age. They now moved on with alacrity, for, as Peter &s;aid, they had <Q REND="inline">"nothing to fear."</Q></P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age led into a large area, on one &s;ide of which, over a range of cloi&s;ters, appeared the we&s;t tower, and a lofty part of the edifice; the other &s;ide was open to the woods. La Motte led the way to a door of the tower, which he now perceived was the &s;ame he had formerly entered; but he found &s;ome difficulty in ad|vancing, for the area was overgrown with brambles and nettles, and the light, which Peter carried, afforded only an uncertain gleam. When he unclo&s;ed the door, the di&s;mal a&s;pect of the place revived the apprehen&s;ions of Madame La Motte, and extorted from Adeline an inquiry whither they were going. Peter held up the light to &s;hew the narrow &s;tair-ca&s;e that wound round the tower; but La Motte, ob&s;erving the &s;econd door, drew back the ru&s;ty bolts, and entered a &s;pacious apartment, which, from its &s;tile and condition, was evidently of a much later date than the other part of the &s;tructure: though de&s;olate and forlorn, it was very little impaired by time; the walls were damp, but not decayed; and the gla&s;s was yet firm in the windows.</P>
<P>They pa&s;&s;ed on to a &s;uit of apartments re|&s;embling the fir&s;t they had &s;een, and expre&s;&s;ed their &s;urpri&s;e at the incongruous appearance of this part of the edifice with the mouldering walls
<PB N="33" REF="35">
they had left behind. The&s;e apartments con|ducted them to a winding pa&s;&s;age, that received light and air through narrow cavities, placed high in the wall; and was at length clo&s;ed by a door barred with iron, which being with &s;ome difficulty opened, they entered a vaulted room. La Motte &s;urveyed it with a &s;crutinizing eye, and endeavoured to conjecture for what purpo&s;e it had been guarded by a door of &s;uch &s;trength; but he &s;aw little within to a&s;&s;i&s;t his curio&s;ity. The room appeared to have been built in mo|dern times upon a Gothic plan. Adeline ap|proached a large window that formed a kind of rece&s;s rai&s;ed by one &s;tep over the level of the floor; &s;he ob&s;erved to La Motte that the whole floor was inlaid with Mo&s;aic work; which drew from him a remark, that the &s;tyle of this apart|ment was not &s;trictly Gothic. He pa&s;&s;ed on to a door, which appeared on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the apartment, and, unlocking it, found him|&s;elf in the great hall, by which he had entered the fabric.</P>
<P>He now perceived, what the gloom had be|fore concealed, a &s;piral &s;tair-ca&s;e, which led to a gallery above; and which, from its pre&s;ent condition, &s;eemed to have been built with the more modern part of the fabric, though this al&s;o affected the Gothic mode of architecture: La Motte had little doubt that the&s;e &s;tairs led to apartments, corre&s;ponding with tho&s;e he had pa&s;&s;ed below, and he&s;itated whether to explore
<PB N="34" REF="36">
them; but the entreaties of Madame, who was much fatigued, prevailed with him to defer all farther examination. After &s;ome deliberation, in which of the rooms they &s;hould pa&s;s the night, they determined to return to that which opened from the tower.</P>
<P>A fire was kindled on a hearth, which it is probable had not for many years before afforded the warmth of ho&s;pitality; and Peter having &s;pread the provi&s;ion he had brought from the coach, La Motte and his family, encircled round the fire, partook of a repa&s;t, which hun|ger and fatigue made delicious. Apprehen&s;ion gradually gave way to confidence, for they now found them&s;elves in &s;omething like a human habitation, and they had lei&s;ure to laugh at their late terrors; but, as the bla&s;t &s;hook the doors, Adeline often &s;tarted, and threw a fearful glance around. They continued to laugh and talk cheerfully for a time; yet their merriment was tran&s;ient, if not affected; for a &s;en&s;e of their peculiar and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances pre&s;&s;ed upon their recollection, and &s;unk each individual into langour and pen&s;ive &s;ilence. Adeline felt the forlornne&s;s of her condition with energy; &s;he reflected upon the pa&s;t with a&s;toni&s;hment, and anticipated the future with fear. She found her&s;elf wholly dependent upon &s;trangers, with no other claim than what di&s;tre&s;s demands from the common &s;ympathy of kindred beings; &s;ighs &s;welled her heart, and the frequent tear &s;tarted
<PB N="35" REF="37">
to her eye; but &s;he checked it, ere it betrayed on her cheek the &s;orrow, which &s;he thought it would be ungrateful to reveal.</P>
<P>La Motte, at length, broke this meditative &s;ilence, by directing the fire to be renewed for the night, and the door to be &s;ecured: this &s;eemed a nece&s;&s;ary precaution, even in this &s;o|litude, and was effected by means of large &s;tones piled again&s;t it, for other fa&s;tening there was none. It had frequently occurred to La Motte, that this apparently for&s;aken edifice might be a place of refuge to banditti. Here was &s;olitude to conceal them; and a wild and exten|&s;ive fore&s;t to a&s;&s;i&s;t their &s;chemes of rapine, and to perplex, with its labyrinths, tho&s;e who might be bold enough to attempt pur&s;uit. The&s;e ap|prehen&s;ions, however, he hid within his own bo&s;om, &s;aving his companions from a &s;hare of the unea&s;ine&s;s they occa&s;ioned. Peter was or|dered to watch at the door, and, having given the fire a rou&s;ing &s;tir, our de&s;olate party drew round it, and &s;ought in &s;leep a &s;hort oblivion of care.</P>
<P>The night pa&s;&s;ed on without di&s;turbance. Adeline &s;lept, but unea&s;y dreams fleeted before her fancy, and &s;he awoke at an early hour: the recollection of her &s;orrows aro&s;e upon her mind, and yielded to their pre&s;&s;ure, her tears flowed &s;ilently and fa&s;t. That &s;he might indulge them without re&s;traint, &s;he went to a window that looked upon an open part of the fore&s;t; all was
<PB N="36" REF="38">
gloom and &s;ilence; &s;he &s;tood for &s;ome time viewing the &s;hadowy &s;cene.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t tender tints of morning now appeared on the verge of the horizon, &s;tealing upon the darkne&s;s;&mdash;&s;o pure, &s;o fine, &s;o aetherial! it &s;eemed as if Heaven was opening to the view. The dark mi&s;ts were &s;een to roll off to the we&s;t, as the tints of light grew &s;tronger, deepening the ob&s;curity of that part of the hemi&s;phere, and involving the features of the country below; meanwhile, in the ea&s;t, the hues became more vivid, darting a trembling lu&s;tre far around, till a ruddy glow, which fired all that part of the Heavens, announced the ri&s;ing &s;un. At fir&s;t, a &s;mall line of inconceivable &s;plendour emerged on the horizon, which quickly expanding, the &s;un appeared in all his glory, unveiling the whole face of nature, vivifying every colour of the land&s;cape, and &s;prinkling the dewy earth with glittering light. The low and gentle re&s;pon&s;es of birds, awakened by the morning ray, now broke the &s;ilence of the hour; their &s;oft warbling ri&s;ing by degrees till they &s;welled the chorus of univer&s;al gladne&s;s. Adeline's heart &s;welled too with gratitude and adoration.</P>
<P>The &s;cene before her &s;oothed her mind, and exalted her thoughts to the great Author of Na|ture; &s;he uttered an involuntary prayer: <Q REND="inline">"Fa|ther of good, who made this glorious &s;cene! I re&s;ign my&s;elf to thy hands: thou wilt &s;up|port
<PB N="37" REF="39">
me under my pre&s;ent &s;orrows, and pro|tect me from future evil."</Q></P>
<P>Thus confiding in the benevolence of God, &s;he wiped the tears from her eyes, while the &s;weet union of con&s;cience and reflection rewarded her tru&s;t; and her mind, lofing the feelings which had lately oppre&s;&s;ed it, became tranquil and compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>La Motte awoke &s;oon after, and Peter prepa|red to &s;et out on his expedition. As he mounted his hor&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"An' plea&s;e you, Ma&s;ter,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"I think we had as good look no farther for an habitation till better times turn up; for nobody will think of looking for us here; and when one &s;ees the place by day light, its none &s;o bad, but what a little patching up would make it comfortable enough."</Q> La Motte made no reply, but he thought of Peter's words. Du|ring the intervals of the night, when anxiety had kept him waking, the &s;ame idea had occurred to him; concealment was his only &s;ecurity, and this place afforded it. The de&s;olation of the &s;pot was repul&s;ive to his wi&s;hes; but he had only a choice of evils&mdash;a fore&s;t with liberty was not a bad home for one, who had too much rea&s;on to expect a pri&s;on. As he walked through the apartments, and examined their condition more attentively, he perceived they might ea&s;ily be made habitable; and now &s;urveying them under the cheerfulne&s;s of morning, his de&s;ign &s;trength|ened; and he mu&s;ed upon the means of accom|pli&s;hing
<PB N="38" REF="40">
it, which nothing &s;eemed &s;o much to ob&s;truct as the apparent difficulty of procuring food.</P>
<P>He communicated his thoughts to Madame La Motte, who felt repugnance to the &s;cheme. La Motte, however &s;eldom con&s;ulted his wife till he had determined how to act; and he had already re&s;olved to be guided in this affair by the report of Peter. If he could di&s;cover a town in the neighbourhood of the fore&s;t, where provi&s;ions and other nece&s;&s;aries could be pro|cured, he would &s;eek no farther for a place of re&s;t.</P>
<P>In the mean time, he &s;pent the anxious inter|val of Peter's ab&s;ence in examining the ruin, and walking over the environs; they were &s;weetly romantic, and the luxuriant woods, with which they abounded, &s;eemed to &s;eque&s;ter this &s;pot from the re&s;t of the world. Frequently a natu|ral vi&s;ta would yield a view of the country, ter|minated by hills, which retiring in di&s;tance, fa|ded into the blue horizon. A &s;tream, various and mu&s;ical in its cour&s;e, wound at the foot of the lawn, on which &s;tood the abbey; here it &s;ilently glided beneath the &s;hades, feeding the flowers that bloomed on its banks, and diffu&s;ing dewy fre&s;hne&s;s around; there it &s;pread in broad expan&s;e to-day, reflecting the &s;ylvan &s;cene, and the wild deer that ta&s;ted its waves. La Motte ob&s;erved every where a profu&s;ion of game; the phea&s;ants &s;carcely flew from his approach,
<PB N="39" REF="41">
and the deer gazed mildly at him as he pa&s;&s;ed. They were &s;trangers to man!</P>
<P>On his return to the abbey, La Motte a&s;|cended the &s;tairs that led to the tower. About half way up, a door appeared in the wall; it yielded, without re&s;i&s;tance, to his hand; but, a &s;udden noi&s;e within, accompanied by a cloud of du&s;t, made him &s;tep back and clo&s;e the door. After waiting a few minutes, he again opened it, and perceived a large room of the more modern building. The remains of tape&s;try hung in tat|ters upon the walls, which were become the re&s;i|dence of birds of prey, who&s;e &s;udden flight on the opening of the door had brought down a quantity of du&s;t, and occa&s;ioned the noi&s;e. The windows were &s;hattered, and almo&s;t without gla&s;s; but he was &s;urpri&s;ed to ob&s;erve &s;ome re|mains of furniture; chairs, who&s;e fa&s;hion and condition bore the date of their antiquity; a broken table, and an iron gate almo&s;t con&s;umed by ru&s;t.</P>
<P>On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the room was a door, which led to another apartment, proportioned like the fir&s;t, but hung with arras &s;omewhat le&s;s tattered. In one corner &s;tood a &s;mall bed|&s;tead, and a few &s;hattered chairs were placed round the walls. La Motte gazed with a mix|ture of wonder and curio&s;ity. <Q REND="inline">"'Tis &s;trange,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"that the&s;e rooms, and the&s;e alone, &s;hould bear the marks of inhabitation; per|haps, &s;ome wretched wanderer, like my&s;elf,
<PB N="40" REF="42">
may have here &s;ought refuge from a per&s;e|cuting world; and here, perhaps, laid down the load of exi&s;tence: perhaps, too, I have followed his foot&s;teps, but to mingle my du&s;t with his!"</Q> He turned &s;uddenly, and was about to quit the room, when he perceived a &s;mall door near the bed; it opened into a clo&s;et, which was lighted by one &s;mall window, and was in the &s;ame condition as the apartments he had pa&s;&s;ed, except that it was de&s;titute even of the remains of furniture. As he walked over the floor, he thought he felt one part of it &s;hake beneath his &s;teps, and, examining, found a trap door. Curio&s;ity prompted him to explore far|ther, and with &s;ome difficulty he opened it. It di&s;clo&s;ed a &s;tairca&s;e which terminated in dark|ne&s;s. La Motte de&s;cended a few &s;teps, but was unwilling to tru&s;t the aby&s;s; and, after wonder|ing for what purpo&s;e it was &s;o &s;ecretly con|&s;tructed, he clo&s;ed the trap, and quitted this &s;uit of apartments.</P>
<P>The &s;tairs in the tower above were &s;o much decayed, that he did not attempt to a&s;cend them: he returned to the hall, and by the &s;piral &s;tair|ca&s;e, which he had ob&s;erved the evening before, reached the gallery, and found another &s;uit of apartments entirely unfurni&s;hed, very much like tho&s;e below.</P>
<P>He renewed with Madame La Motte his for|mer conver&s;ation re&s;pecting the abbey, and &s;he exerted all her endeavours to di&s;&s;uade him from
<PB N="41" REF="43">
his purpo&s;e, acknowledging the &s;olitary &s;ecurity of the &s;pot, but pleading that other places might be found equally well adapted for concealment and more for comfort. This La Motte doubt|ed: be&s;ides, the fore&s;t abounded with game, which would at once, afford him amu&s;ement and food, a circum&s;tance, con&s;idering his &s;mall &s;tock of money, by no means to be overlooked: and he had &s;uffered his mind to dwell &s;o much upon the &s;cheme, that it was become a favourite one. Adeline li&s;tened in &s;ilent anxiety to the di&s;cour&s;e, and waited the i&s;&s;ue of Peter's report.</P>
<P>The morning pa&s;&s;ed, but Peter did not re|turn. Our &s;olitary party took their dinner of the provi&s;ion they had fortunately brought with them, and afterwards walked forth into the woods. Adeline, who never &s;uffered any good to pa&s;s unnoticed, becau&s;e it came attended with evil, forgot for a while the de&s;olation of the abbey in the beauty of the adjacent &s;cenery. The plea&s;antne&s;s of the &s;hades &s;oothed her heart, and the varied features of the land&s;cape amu&s;ed her fancy; &s;he almo&s;t thought &s;he could be con|tented to live here. Already &s;he began to feel an intere&s;t in the concerns of her companions, and for Madame La Motte &s;he felt more; it was the warm emotion of gratitude and af|fection.</P>
<P>The afternoon wore away, and they returned to the abbey. Peter was &s;till ab&s;ent, and his ab|&s;ence now began to excite &s;urprize and appre|hen&s;ion.
<PB N="42" REF="44">
The approach of darkne&s;s al&s;o threw a gloom upon the hopes of the wanderers: ano|ther night mu&s;t be pa&s;&s;ed under the &s;ame forlorn circum&s;tances as the preceding one; and, what was &s;till wor&s;e, with a very &s;canty &s;tock of pro|vi&s;ions. The fortitude of Madame La Motte now entirely for&s;ook her, and &s;he wept bitterly. Adeline's heart was as mournful as Madame's, but &s;he rallied her drooping &s;pirits, and gave the fir&s;t in&s;tance of her kindne&s;s by endeavouring to revive tho&s;e of her friend.</P>
<P>La Motte was re&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y, and, leav|ing the abbey, he walked alone the way which Peter had taken. He had not gone far, when he perceived him between the trees, leading his hor&s;e. <Q REND="inline">"What news, Peter?"</Q> hallooed La Motte. Peter came on, panting for breath, and &s;aid not a word, till La Motte repeated the que&s;tion in a tone of &s;omewhat more authority. <Q REND="inline">"Ah, ble&s;s you, Ma&s;ter!"</Q> &s;aid he, when he had taken breath to an&s;wer, <Q REND="inline">"I am glad to &s;ee you; I thought I &s;hould never have got back again: I've met with a world of mis|fortunes."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, you may relate them hereafter; let me hear whelher you have di&s;cover|ed&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Di&s;covered!"</Q> interrupted Peter, <Q REND="inline">"Yes, I am di&s;covered with a vengeance! If your Honour will look at my arms, you'll &s;ee how I am di&s;covered."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="45">
<Q REND="inline">"Di&s;coloured! I &s;uppo&s;e you mean,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte. <Q REND="inline">"But how came you in this condition?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, I'll tell you how it was, Sir; your Honour knows I learned a &s;mack of boxing of that Engli&s;hman that u&s;ed to come with his ma&s;ter to our hou&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, well&mdash;tell me where you have been."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;carcely know my&s;elf, Ma&s;ter; I've been where I got a &s;ound drubbing, but then it was in your bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;o I don't mind. But if ever I meet with that ra&s;cal again!"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You &s;eem to like your fir&s;t drubbing &s;o well, that you want another, and unle&s;s you &s;peak more to the purpo&s;e, you &s;hall &s;oon have one."</Q></P>
<P>Peter was now frightened into method, and deavoured to proceed: <Q REND="inline">"When I left the old Abbey,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"I followed the way you di|rected, and, turning to the right of that grove of trees yonder, I looked this way and that to &s;ee if I could &s;ee a hou&s;e, or a cottage, or even a man, but not a <HI>&s;oul</HI> of them was to be &s;een, and &s;o I jogged on, near the value of a league, I warrant, and then I came to a track; oh! oh! &s;ays I, we have you now; this will do&mdash;paths can't be made without feet. How|ever, I was out in my reckoning, for the devil a bit of a <HI>&s;oul</HI> could I &s;ee, and, after follow|ing
<PB N="44" REF="46">
the track this way and that way, for the third of a league, I lo&s;t it, and had to find out another."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is it impo&s;&s;ible for you to &s;peak to the point?"</Q> &s;aid La Motte: <Q REND="inline">"omit the&s;e fooli&s;h particulars, and tell whether you have &s;uc|ceeded."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, then, Ma&s;ter, to be &s;hort, for that's the neare&s;t way after all, I wandered a long while at random, I did not know where, all through a fore&s;t like this, and I took &s;pecial care to note how the trees &s;tood, that I might find my way back. At la&s;t I came to another path, and was &s;ure I &s;hould find &s;omething now, though I had found nothing before, for I could not be mi&s;taken twice; &s;o, peeping between the trees, I &s;pied a cottage, and I gave my hor&s;e a la&s;h, that &s;ounded through the fore&s;t, and I was at the door in a minute. They told me there was a town about half a league off, and bade me follow the track and it would bring me there, &s;o it did; and my hor&s;e, I believe, &s;melt the corn in the man|ger by the rate he went at. I inquired for a wheel-wright, and was told there was but one in the place, and he could not be found. I waited and waited, for I knew it was in vain to think of returning without doing my bu&s;i|ne&s;s. The man at la&s;t came home from the country, and I told him how long I had wait|ed;
<PB N="45" REF="47">
for, &s;ays I, I knew it was in vain to return without my bu&s;ine&s;s."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do be le&s;s tedious,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"if it is in thy nature."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is in my nature,"</Q> an&s;wered Peter, <Q REND="inline">"and if it was more in my nature, your Honour &s;hould have it all. Would you think it, Sir, the fellow had the impudence to a&s;k a louis-d'or for mending the coach wheel! I believe in my con&s;cience he &s;aw I was in a hurry and could not do without him. A louis-d'or! &s;ays I, my Ma&s;ter &s;hall give no &s;uch price, he &s;ha'n't be impo&s;ed upon by no &s;uch ra&s;cal as you. Whereupon, the fellow looked glum, and gave me a dou&s;e o'the chops: with this, I up with my fi&s;t and gave him another, and &s;hould have beat him pre&s;ently, if another man had not come in, and then I was obliged to give up."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And &s;o you are returned as wi&s;e as you went?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, Ma&s;ter, I hope I have too much &s;pirit to &s;ubmit to a ra&s;cal, or let you &s;ubmit to one either; be&s;ides, I have bought &s;ome nails to try if I can't mend the wheel my&s;elf&mdash;I had always a hand at carpentry."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, I commend your zeal in my cau&s;e, but on this occa&s;ion it was rather ill-timed. And what have you got in that ba&s;ket?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, Ma&s;ter, I bethought me that we could not get away from this place till the car|riage
<PB N="46" REF="48">
was ready to draw us, and in the mean time, &s;ays I, nobody can live without victu|als, &s;o I'll e'en lay out the little money I have and take a ba&s;ket with me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That's the only wi&s;e thing you have done yet, and this, indeed, redeems your blunders."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why now, Ma&s;ter, it does my heart good to hear you &s;peak; I knew I was doing for the be&s;t all the while: but I've had a hard job to find my way back; and here's another piece of ill luck, for the hor&s;e has got a thorn in his foot."</Q></P>
<P>La Motte made inquiries concerning the town, and found it was capable of &s;upplying him with provi&s;ion, and what little furniture was nece&s;&s;ary to render the abbey habitable. This intelligence almo&s;t &s;ettled his plans, and he or|dered Peter to return on the following morning and make inquiries concerning the abbey. If the an&s;wers were favourable to his wi&s;hes, he commi&s;&s;ioned him to buy a cart and load it with &s;ome furniture, and &s;ome materials nece&s;&s;ary for repairing the modern apartments. Peter &s;tared: <Q REND="inline">"What, does your Honour mean to live here?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, &s;uppo&s;e I do?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why then your Honour has made a wi&s;e determination, according to my hint; for your Honour knows I &s;aid"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="49"><Q REND="inline">"Well, Peter, it is not hece&s;&s;ary to repeat what you &s;aid; perhaps, I had determined on the &s;ubject before."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Egad, Ma&s;ter, you're in the right, and I'm glad of it, for, I believe, we &s;hall not quickly be di&s;turbed here, except by the rooks and owls. Yes, yes&mdash;I warrant I'll make it a place fit for a king; and as for the town, one may get any thing, I'm &s;ure of that; though they think no more about this place than they do about India or England, or any of tho&s;e places."</Q></P>
<P>They now reached the abbey, where Peter was received with great joy; but the hopes of his mi&s;tre&s;s and Adeline were repre&s;&s;ed, when they learned that he returned, without having executed his commi&s;&s;ion, and heard his account of the town. La Motte's orders to Peter were heard with almo&s;t equal concern by Madame and Adeline; but the latter concealed her unea|&s;ine&s;s, and u&s;ed all her efforts to overcome that of her friend. The &s;weetne&s;s of her behaviour, and the air of &s;atisfaction &s;he a&s;&s;umed, &s;en&s;ibly affected Madame, and di&s;covered to her a &s;ource of comfort, which &s;he had hitherto overlooked. The affectionate attentions of her young friend promi&s;ed to con&s;ole her for the want of other &s;ociety, and her conver&s;ation to enliven the hours which might otherwi&s;e be pa&s;&s;ed in painful regret.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="50">
The ob&s;ervations and general behaviour of Adeline already be&s;poke a good under&s;tanding and an amiable heart, but &s;he had yet more&mdash;&s;he had genius. She was now in her nineteenth year; her figure of the middling &s;ize, and turned to the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite proportion; her hair was dark auburn, her eyes blue, and whether they &s;parkled with intelligence, or melted with ten|derne&s;s, they were equally attractive: her form had the airy lightne&s;s of a nymph, and, when &s;he &s;miled, her countenance might have been drawn for the younger &s;i&s;ter of Hebe: the cap|tivations of her beauty were heightened by the grace and &s;implicity of her manners, and con|firmed by the intrin&s;ic value of a heart
<Q><L>"That might be &s;hrin'd in cry&s;tal,</L>

<P>Annette now kindled the fire for the night: Peter's ba&s;ket was opened, and &s;upper prepared. Madame La Motte was &s;till pen&s;ive and &s;ilent. <Q REND="inline">"There is &s;carcely any condition &s;o bad,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline, <Q REND="inline">"but we may one time or other wi&s;h we had not quitted it.

And I am certain, there is no &s;ituation &s;o de&s;titute, but comfort may be extracted from it. The blaze of this fire &s;hines yet more cheerfully

from the contra&s;ted drearine&s;s of the place; and this plentiful repa&s;t is made yet more delicious, from the temporary want we have &s;uffered. Let us enjoy the good and forget the evil."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You &s;peak, my dear,"</Q> replied Madame La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"like one, who&s;e &s;pirits have not been often depre&s;&s;ed by misfortune, (Adeline &s;ighed) and who&s;e hopes are, therefore, vi|gorous."</Q> <Q REND="inline"> "Long &s;uffering,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"has &s;ubdued in our minds that ela&s;tic energy, which repels the pre&s;&s;ure of evil, and dances to the bound of joy.

<P><Q REND="inline">"And may now, my dear Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline. <Q REND="inline">"Still believe it po&s;&s;ible, and you will find it is &s;o."</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"Pardon me, Sir, if I &s;ay, it is now only you deceive your&s;elf, by &s;uffering the cloud of &s;orrow to tinge every object you look upon."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It may be &s;o,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"but let us leave the &s;ubject."</Q></P>
<P>After &s;upper, the doors were &s;ecured, as be|fore, for the night, and the wanderers re&s;igned them&s;elves to repo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="52">
On the following morning, Peter again &s;et out for the little town of Auboine, and the hours of his ab&s;ence were again &s;pent by Madame La Motte and Adeline in much anxiety and &s;ome hope, for the intelligence he might bring con|cerning the abbey might yet relea&s;e them from the plans of La Motte. Towards the clo&s;e of day he was de&s;cried coming &s;lowly on; and the cart, which accompanied him, too certainly confirmed their fears. He brought materials for repairing the place, and &s;ome furniture.</P>
<P>Of the abbey he gave an account, of which the following is the &s;ub&s;tance:&mdash;It belonged, to|gether with a large part of the adjacent fore&s;t, to a nobleman, who now re&s;ided with his fa|mily on a remote e&s;tate. He inherited it, in right of his wife, from his father-in-law, who had cau&s;ed the more modern apartments to be erected, and had re&s;ided in them &s;ome part of every year, for the purpo&s;e of &s;hooting and hunting. It was reported, that &s;ome per&s;on was, &s;oon after it came to the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, brought &s;ecretly to the abbey and confined in the&s;e apartments; who, or what he was, had never been conjectured, and what became of him nobody knew. The report died gradually away, and many per&s;ons entirely di&s;believed the whole of it. But however this affair might be, certain it was, the pre&s;ent owner had vi&s;ited the abbey only two &s;ummers, &s;ince his &s;ucceeding
<PB N="51" REF="53">
to it; and the furniture, after &s;ome time, was removed.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance had at fir&s;t excited &s;urprize, and various reports aro&s;e in con&s;equence, but it was difficult to know what ought to be be|lieved. Among the re&s;t, it was &s;aid, that &s;trange appearances had been ob&s;erved at the abbey, and uncommon noi&s;es heard; and though this report had been ridiculed by &s;en&s;ible per&s;ons as the idle &s;uper&s;tition of ignorance, it had fa&s;|tened &s;o &s;trongly upon the minds of the common people, that for the la&s;t &s;eventeen years none of the pea&s;antry had ventured to approach the &s;pot. The abbey was now, therefore, aban|doned to decay.</P>
<P>La Motte ruminated upon this account. At fir&s;t, it called up unplea&s;ant ideas, but they were &s;oon di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and con&s;iderations more intere&s;ting to his welfare took place: he con|gratulated him&s;elf that he had now found a &s;pot, where he was not likely to be either di&s;covered or di&s;turbed; yet it could not e&s;cape him that there was a &s;trange coincidence between one part of Peter's narrative, and the condition of the chambers that opened from the tower above &s;tairs. The remains of furniture, of which the other apartments were void&mdash;the &s;olitary bed&mdash;the number and connection of the rooms, were circum&s;tances that united to confirm his opinion. This, however, he concealed in his own brea&s;t,
<PB N="52" REF="54">
for he already perceived that Peter's account had not a&s;&s;i&s;ted in reconciling his family to the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of dwelling at the abbey.</P>
<P>But they had only to &s;ubmit in &s;ilence, and whatever di&s;agreeable apprehen&s;ion might in|trude upon them, they now appeared willing to &s;uppre&s;s the expre&s;&s;ion of it. Peter, indeed, was exempt from any evil of this kind; he knew no fear, and his mind was now wholly occupied with his approaching bu&s;ine&s;s. Madame La Motte, with a placid kind of de&s;pair, endea|voured to reconcile her&s;elf to that, which no effort of under&s;tanding could teach her to avoid, and which, an indulgence in lamentation, could only make more intolerable. Indeed, though a &s;en&s;e of the immediate inconveniences to be endured at the abbey, had made her oppo&s;e the &s;cheme of living there, &s;he did not really know how their &s;ituation could be improved by re|moval: yet her thoughts often wandered towards Paris, and reflected the retro&s;pect of pa&s;t times, with the images of weeping friends left, perhaps, for ever. The affectionate endearments of her only &s;on, whom, from the danger of his &s;itua|tion, and the ob&s;curity of hers, &s;he might rea|&s;onably fear never to &s;ee again, aro&s;e upon her memory and overcame her fortitude. <Q REND="inline">"Why&mdash;why was I re&s;erved for this hour?"</Q> would &s;he &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"and what will be my years to come?"</Q></P>
<P>Adeline had no retro&s;pect of pa&s;t delight to give empha&s;is to pre&s;ent calamity&mdash;no weeping
<PB N="53" REF="55">
friends&mdash;no dear regretted objects to point the edge of &s;orrow, and throw a &s;ickly hue upon her future pro&s;pects: &s;he knew not yet the pangs of di&s;appointed hope, or the acuter &s;ting of &s;elf|accu&s;ation; &s;he had no mi&s;ery, but what pati|ence could a&s;&s;uage, or fortitude overcome.</P>
<P>At the dawn of the following day Peter aro&s;e to his labour: he proceeded with alacrity, and, in a few days, two of the lower apartments were &s;o much altered for the better, that La Motte began to exult, and his family to perceive that their &s;ituation would not be &s;o mi&s;erable as they had imagined. The furniture Peter had already brought was di&s;po&s;ed in the&s;e rooms, one of which was the vaulted apartment. Madame La Motte furni&s;hed this as a &s;itting room, preferring it for its large Gothic Window, that de&s;cended almo&s;t to the floor, admitting a pro&s;pect of the lawn, and the picture&s;que &s;cenery of the &s;ur|rounding woods.</P>
<P>Peter having returned to Auboine for a farther &s;upply, all the lower apartments were in a few weeks not only habitable, but comfortable. The&s;e, however, being in&s;ufficient for the accommo|dation of the family, a room above &s;tairs was prepared for Adeline; it was the chamber that opened immediately from the tower, and &s;he preferred it to tho&s;e beyond, becau&s;e it was le&s;s di&s;tant from the family, and the windows front|ing an avenue of the fore&s;t, afforded a more ex|ten&s;ive
<PB N="54" REF="56">
pro&s;pect. The tape&s;try, that was de|cayed, and hung loo&s;ely from the walls, was now nailed up, and made to look le&s;s de&s;olate; and, though the room had &s;till a &s;olemn a&s;pect, from its &s;paciou&s;ne&s;s and the narrowne&s;s of the windows, it was not uncomfortable.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t night that Adeline retired hither, &s;he &s;lept little: the &s;olitary air of the place af|fected her &s;pirits; the more &s;o, perhaps, becau&s;e &s;he had, with friendly con&s;ideration, endeavoured to &s;upport them in the pre&s;ence of Madame La Motte. She remembered the narrative of Peter, &s;everal circum&s;tances of which had impre&s;&s;ed her imagination in &s;pite of her rea&s;on, and &s;he found it difficult wholly to &s;ubdue apprehen&s;ion. At one time, terror &s;o &s;trongly &s;eized her mind, that &s;he had even opened the door with an in|tention of calling Madame La Motte; but, li&s;tening for a moment on the &s;tairs of the tower, every thing &s;eemed &s;till; at length, &s;he heard the voice of La Motte &s;peaking cheerfully, and the ab&s;urdity of her fears &s;truck her forcibly; &s;he blu&s;hed that &s;he had for a moment &s;ubmitted to them, and returned to her chamber wondering at her&s;elf.</P>

<P>LA Motte arranged his little plan of living. His mornings were u&s;ually &s;pent in &s;hooting, or fi&s;hing, and the dinner, thus provided by his in|du&s;try, he reli&s;hed with a keener appetite than had ever attended him at the luxurious tables of Paris. The afternoons he pa&s;&s;ed with his family: &s;ometimes he would &s;elect a book from the few he had brought with him, and endeavour to fix his attention to the words his lips repeated:&mdash;but his mind &s;uffered little ab&s;traction from its own cares, and the &s;entiment he pronounced left no trace behind it. Sometimes he conver&s;ed, but oftener &s;at in gloomy &s;ilence, mu&s;ing upon the pa&s;t, or anticipating the future.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="58">
At the&s;e moments, Adeline, with a &s;weetne&s;s almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible, endeavoured to enliven his &s;pirits, and to withdraw him from him&s;elf. Seldom &s;he &s;ucceeded, but when &s;he did, the grateful looks of Madame La Motte, and the benevolent feelings of her own bo&s;om, realized the chearfulne&s;s &s;he had at fir&s;t only a&s;&s;umed. Adeline's mind had the happy art, or, perhaps, it were more ju&s;t to &s;ay, the happy nature, of ac|commodating it&s;elf to her &s;ituation. Her pre|&s;ent condition, though forlorn, was not devoid of comfort, and this comfort was confirmed by her virtues. So much &s;he won upon the affec|tions of her protectors, that Madame La Motte loved her as her child, and La Motte him&s;elf, though a man little &s;u&s;ceptible of tenderne&s;s, could not be in&s;en&s;ible to her &s;olicitudes. When|ever he relaxed from the &s;ullenne&s;s of mi&s;ery, it was at the influence of Adeline.</P>
<P>Peter regularly brought a weekly &s;upply of provi&s;ions from Auboine, and, on tho&s;e occa&s;i|ons, always quitted the town by a route con|trary to that leading to the abbey. Several weeks having pa&s;&s;ed without mole&s;tation, La Motte di&s;mi&s;&s;ed all apprehen&s;ion of pur&s;uit, and at length became tolerably reconciled to the com|plection of his circum&s;tances. As habit and ef|fort &s;trengthened the fortitude of Madame La Motte, the features of mi&s;fortune appeared to &s;often. The fore&s;t, which at fir&s;t &s;eemed to her a
<PB N="57" REF="59">
frightful &s;olitude, had lo&s;t its terrific a&s;pect; and that edifice, who&s;e half demoli&s;hed walls and gloomy de&s;olation had &s;truck her mind with the force of melancholy and di&s;may, was now beheld as a dome&s;tic a&s;ylum, and a &s;afe refuge from the &s;torms of power.</P>
<P>She was a &s;en&s;ible and highly accompli&s;hed woman, and it became her chief delight to form the ri&s;ing graces of Adeline, who had as has been already &s;hown, a &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, which made her quick to repay in&s;truction with improvement, and indulgence with love. Never was Adeline &s;o plea&s;ed as when &s;he anticipated her wi&s;hes, and never &s;o diligent as when &s;he was employed in her bu&s;ine&s;s. The little affairs of the hou&s;hold &s;he overlooked and managed with &s;uch admirable exactne&s;s, that Madame La Motte had neither anxiety, nor care, concerning them. And Adeline formed for her&s;elf in this barren &s;ituation, many amu&s;ements, that occa&s;i|onally bani&s;hed the remembrance of her misfor|tunes. La Motte's books were her chief con&s;o|lation. With one of the&s;e &s;he would fre|quently ramble into the fore&s;t, where the river, winding through a glade, diffu&s;ed coolne&s;s, and with its murmuring accents, invited repo&s;e: there &s;he would &s;eat her&s;elf, and, re&s;igned to the illu&s;ions of the page, pa&s;s many hours in obli|vion of &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Here too, when her mind was tranquilized by the &s;urrounding &s;cenery, &s;he wooed the gentle

mu&s;e, and indulged in ideal happine&s;s. The delight of the&s;e moments &s;he commemorated in the following addre&s;s

<P>Madame La Motte had frequently expre&s;&s;ed curio&s;ity concerning the events of Adeline's life, and by what circum&s;tances &s;he had been thrown into a &s;ituation &s;o perilous and my&s;terious as that in which La Motte had found her. Adeline had given a brief account of the manner in which &s;he had been brought thither, but had always with tears intreated to be &s;pared for that time from a particular relation of her hi&s;tory. Her
<PB N="59" REF="61">
&s;pirits were not then equal to retro&s;pection, but now that they were &s;oothed by quiet, and &s;trengthened by confidence, &s;he one day gave Madame La Motte the following narration.</P>
<Q><P>I am the only child, &s;aid Adeline, of Louis de St. Pierre, a chevalier of reputable family, but of &s;mall fortune, who for many years re&s;ided at Paris. Of my mother I have a faint remem|brance: I lo&s;t her when I was only &s;even years old, and this was my fir&s;t misfortune. At her death, my father gave up hou&s;e-keeping, boar|ded me in a convent, and quitted Paris. Thus was I, at this early period of my life, aban|doned to &s;trangers. My father came &s;ometimes to Paris; he then vi&s;ited me, and I well remem|ber the grief I u&s;ed to feel when he bade me farewell. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, which rung my heart with grief, he appeared unmoved; &s;o that I often thought he had little tenderne&s;s for me. But he was my father; and the only per&s;on to whom I could look up for protection and love.</P>
<P>In this convent I continued till I was twelve years old. A thou&s;and times I had entreated my father to take me home, but at fir&s;t motives of prudence, and afterwards of avarice, prevented him. I was now removed from this convent, and placed in another, where I learned my fa|ther
<PB N="60" REF="62">
intended I &s;hould take the veil. I will not attempt to expre&s;s my &s;urprize and grief on this occa&s;ion. Too long I had been immured in the walls of a cloi&s;ter, and too much had I &s;een of the &s;ullen mi&s;ery of its votaries, not to feel horror and di&s;gu&s;t at the pro&s;pect of being added to their number.</P>
<P>The Lady Abbe&s;s was a woman of rigid de|corum and &s;evere devotion; exact in the ob|&s;ervance of every detail of form, and never for|gave an offence again&s;t ceremony. It was her method, when &s;he wanted to make converts to her order, to denounce and terrify rather than to per&s;uade and allure. Her's were the arts of cunning practi&s;ed upon fear, not tho&s;e of &s;o|phi&s;tication upon rea&s;on. She employed num|berle&s;s &s;tratagems to gain me to her purpo&s;e, and they all wore the complection of her cha|racter. But in the life to which &s;he would have devoted me, I &s;aw too many forms of real terror, to be overcome by the influence of her ideal ho&s;t, and was re&s;olute in rejecting the veil. Here I pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal years of mi&s;erable re&s;i&s;t|ance again&s;t cruelty and &s;uper&s;tition. My father I &s;eldom &s;aw; when I did, I entreated him to alter my de&s;tination, but he objected that his fortune was in&s;ufficient to &s;upport me in the world, and at length denounced vengeance on my head if I per&s;i&s;ted in di&s;obedience.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="63">
You, my dear Madam, can form little idea of the wretchedne&s;s of my &s;ituation, condemned to perpetual impri&s;onment, and impri&s;onment of the mo&s;t dreadful kind, or to the vengeance of a father, from whom I had no appeal. My re&s;olution relaxed&mdash;for &s;ome time I pau&s;ed upon the choice of evils&mdash;but at length the horrors of the mona&s;tic life ro&s;e &s;o fully to my view, that fortitude gave way before them. Excluded from the cheerful intercour&s;e of &s;ociety&mdash;from the plea&s;ant view of nature&mdash;almo&s;t from the light of day&mdash;condemned to &s;ilence&mdash;rigid formality&mdash;ab&s;tinence and penance&mdash;condemned to forego the delights of a world, which imagination painted in the gaye&s;t and mo&s;t alluring colours, and who&s;e hues were, perhaps, not the le&s;s captivating becau&s;e they were only ideal:&mdash;&s;uch was the &s;tate, to which I was de&s;tined. Again my re&s;olution was invigorated: my father's cru|elty &s;ubdued tenderne&s;s, and rou&s;ed indignation. <Q REND="inline">"Since he can forget,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"the affection of a parent, and condemn his child without remor&s;e to wretchedne&s;s and de&s;pair&mdash;the bond of filial and parental duty no longer &s;ub|&s;i&s;ts between us&mdash;he has him&s;elf di&s;&s;olved it, and I will yet &s;truggle for liberty and life."</Q></P>
<P>Finding me unmoved by menace, the Lady Abbe&s;s had now recour&s;e to more &s;ubtle mea|&s;ures: &s;he conde&s;cended to &s;mile, and even to flatter; but her's was the di&s;torted &s;mile of cun|ning,
<PB N="62" REF="64">
not the gracious emblem of kindne&s;s; it provoked di&s;gu&s;t, in&s;tead of in&s;piring affection. She painted the character of a ve&s;tal in the mo&s;t beautiful tints of art&mdash;its holy innocence&mdash;its mild dignity&mdash;its &s;ublime devotion. I &s;ighed as &s;he &s;poke. This &s;he regarded as a favourable &s;ymptom, and proceeded on her picture with more animation. She de&s;cribed the &s;erenity of a mona&s;tic life&mdash;its &s;ecurity from the &s;eductive charms, re&s;tle&s;s pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;orrowful vici&s;|&s;itudes of the world&mdash;the rapturous delights of religion, and the &s;weet reciprocal affection of the &s;i&s;terhood.</P>
<P>So highly &s;he fini&s;hed the piece, that the lurking lines of cunning would, to an inexperi|enced eye, have e&s;caped detection. Mine was too &s;orrowfully informed. Too often had I witne&s;&s;ed the &s;ecret tear and bur&s;ting &s;igh of vain regret, the &s;ullen pinings of di&s;content, and the mute angui&s;h of de&s;pair. My &s;ilence and my manner a&s;&s;ured her of my incredulity, and it was with difficulty that &s;he pre&s;erved a decent compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>My father, as may be imagined, was highly incen&s;ed at my per&s;everance, which he called ob&s;tinacy, but, what will not be &s;o ea&s;ily be|lieved, he &s;oon after relented, and appointed a day to take me from the convent. O! judge of my feelings when I received this intelligence The joy it occa&s;ioned awakened all my gra|titude;
<PB N="63" REF="65">
I forgot the former cruelty of my father, and that the pre&s;ent indulgence was le&s;s the effect of his kindne&s;s than of my re&s;olution. I wept that I could not indulge his every wi&s;h.</P>
<P>What days of bli&s;sful expectation were tho&s;e that preceded my departure! The world, from which I had been hitherto &s;ecluded&mdash;the world, in which my fancy had been &s;o often delighted to roam&mdash;who&s;e paths were &s;trewn with fade|le&s;s ro&s;es&mdash;who&s;e every &s;cene &s;miled in beauty and invited to delight&mdash;where all the people were good, and all the good happy&mdash;Ah! <HI>then</HI> that world was bur&s;ting upon my view. Let me catch the rapturous remembrance before it vani&s;h! It is like the pa&s;&s;ing lights of autumn, that gleam for a moment on a hill, and then leave it to darkne&s;s. I counted the days and hours that with-held me from this fairy land. It was in the convent only that people were de|ceitful and cruel: it was there only that mi&s;ery dwelt. I was quitting it all! How I pitied the poor nuns that were to be left behind. I would have given half that world I prized &s;o much, had it been mine, to have taken them out with me.</P>
<P>The long wi&s;hed for day at la&s;t arrived. My father came, and for a moment my joy was lo&s;t in the &s;orrow of bidding farewell to my poor companions, for whom I had never felt &s;uch warmth of kindne&s;s as at this in&s;tant. I was
<PB N="64" REF="66">
&s;oon beyond the gates of the convent. I looked around me, and viewed the va&s;t vault of heaven no longer bounded by mona&s;tic walls, and the green earth extended in hill and dale to the round verge of the horizon! My heart danced with delight, tears &s;welled in my eyes, and for &s;ome moments I was unable to &s;peak. My thoughts ro&s;e to Heaven in &s;entiments of gra|titude to the Giver of all good!</P>
<P>At length, I returned to my father; dear Sir, &s;aid I, how I thank you for my deliverance, and how I wi&s;h I could do every thing to oblige you.</P>
<P>Return, then, to your convent, &s;aid he, in a har&s;h accent. I &s;huddered; his look and manner jarred the tone of my feelings; they &s;truck di&s;cord upon my heart, which had before re&s;ponded only to harmony. The ardour of joy was in a moment repre&s;&s;ed, and every object around me was &s;addened with the gloom of di&s;|appointment. It was not that I &s;u&s;pected my father would take me back to the convent; but that his feelings &s;eemed &s;o very di&s;&s;onant to the joy and gratitude, which I had but a moment before felt and expre&s;&s;ed to him.&mdash;Pardon, Ma|dam, a relation of the&s;e trivial circum&s;tances; the &s;trong vici&s;&s;itudes of feeling which they im|pre&s;&s;ed upon my heart, make me think them important, when they are, perhaps, only di&s;|gu&s;ting.</P></Q>

<Q REND="inline">"No, my dear,"</Q> &s;aid Madame La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"they are intere&s;ting to me; they illu&s;trate lit|tle traits of character, which I love to ob|&s;erve.

<P>The&s;e words melted the heart of Adeline; &s;he ki&s;&s;ed the hand which Madame held out, and remained a few minutes &s;ilent. At length &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"May I de&s;erve this goodne&s;s! and may I ever be thankful to God, who, in giving me &s;uch a friend, has rai&s;ed me to comfort and hope!"</Q></P>
<Q><P>My father's hou&s;e was &s;ituated a few lea|gues on the other &s;ide of Paris, and in our way to it, we pa&s;&s;ed through that city. What a novel &s;cene! Where were now the &s;olemn faces, the demure manners I had been accu&s;|tomed to &s;ee in the convent? Every counte|nance was here animated, either by bu&s;ine&s;s or plea&s;ure; every &s;tep was airy, and every &s;mile was gay. All the people appeared like friends; they looked and &s;miled at me; I &s;miled again, and wi&s;hed to have told them how plea&s;ed I was. How delightful, &s;aid I, to live &s;urrounded by friends!</P>
<P>What crowded &s;treets! What magnificent hotels! What &s;plendid equipages! I &s;carcely ob&s;erved that the &s;treets were narrow, or the
<PB N="66" REF="68">
way dangerous. What bu&s;tle, what tumult, what delight! I could never be &s;ufficiently thankful that I was removed from the convent. Again, I was going to expre&s;s my gratitude to my father, but his looks forbad me, and I was &s;ilent. I am too diffu&s;e; even the faint forms which memory reflects of pa&s;&s;ed de|light are grateful to the heart. The &s;hadow of plea&s;ure is &s;till gazed upon with a melan|choly enjoyment, though the &s;ub&s;tance is fled beyond our reach.</P>
<P>Having quitted Paris, which I left with many &s;ighs, and gazed upon till the towers of every church di&s;&s;olved in di&s;tance from my view; we entered upon a gloomy and unfre|quented road. It was evening when we reached a wild heath; I looked round in &s;earch of a human dwelling, but could find none; and not a human being was to be &s;een. I experienced &s;omething of what I u&s;ed to feel in the convent; my heart had not been &s;o &s;ad &s;ince I left it. Of my father, who &s;till &s;at in &s;ilence, I inquired if we were near home; he an&s;wered in the affirmative. Night came on, however, before we reached the place of our de&s;tination; it was a lone hou&s;e on the wa&s;te; but I need not de&s;cribe it to you, Madam. When the carriage &s;topped, two men appear|ed at the door, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted us to alight; &s;o gloomy were their countenances, and &s;o few
<PB N="67" REF="69">
their words, I almo&s;t fancied my&s;elf again in the convent. Certain it is, I had not &s;een &s;uch melancholy faces &s;ince I quitted it. Is this a part of the world I have &s;o fondly con|templated? &s;aid I.</P>
<P>The interior appearance of the hou&s;e was de&s;olate and mean; I was &s;urpri&s;ed that my father had cho&s;en &s;uch a place for his habita|tion, and al&s;o that no woman was to be &s;een; but I knew that inquiry would only produce a reproof, and was, therefore, &s;ilent. At &s;up|per, the two men I had before &s;een &s;at down with us; they &s;aid little, but &s;eemed to ob|&s;erve me much. I was confu&s;ed and di&s;plea&s;|ed, which, my father noticing, frowned at them with a look, which convinced me he meant more than I comprehended. When the cloth was drawn, my father took my hand and conducted me to the door of my chamber; having &s;et down the candle, and wi&s;hed me good night, he left me to my own &s;olitary thoughts.</P>
<P>How different were they from tho&s;e I had indulged a few hours before! then expecta|tion, hope, delight, danced before me; now melancholy and di&s;appointment chilled the ardour of my mind, and di&s;coloured my fu|ture pro&s;pect. The appearance of every thing around conduced to depre&s;s me. On the floor lay a &s;mall bed without curtains, or
<PB N="68" REF="70">
hangings; two old chairs and a table were all the remaining furniture in the room. I went to the window, with an intention of looking out upon the &s;urrounding &s;cene, and found it was grated. I was &s;hocked at this circum|&s;tance, and, comparing it with the lonely &s;ituation, and the &s;trange appearance of the hou&s;e, together with the countenances and be|haviour of the men who had &s;upped with us, I was lo&s;t in a labyrinth of conjecture.</P>
<P>At length I laid down to &s;leep; but the anxiety of my mind prevented repo&s;e, gloo|my unplea&s;ing images flitted before my fancy, and I fell into a &s;ort of waking dream: I thought that I was in a lonely fore&s;t with my father; his looks were &s;evere, and his ge&s;|tures menacing: he upbraided me for leav|ing the convent, and while he &s;poke, drew from his pocket a mirror, which he held be|fore my face; I looked in it and &s;aw, (my blood now thrills as I repeat it) I &s;aw my&s;elf wounded, and bleeding profu&s;ely. Then I thought my&s;elf in the hou&s;e again; and &s;ud|denly heard the&s;e words, in accents &s;o di&s;tinct, that for &s;ome time after I awoke, I could &s;carcely believe them ideal, 'Depart this hou&s;e, de&s;truction hovers here.</P>
<P>I was awakened by a foot&s;tep on ihe &s;tairs; it was my father retiring to his cham|ber;
<PB N="69" REF="71">
the latene&s;s of the hour &s;urpri&s;ed me, for it was pa&s;t midnight.</P>
<P>On the following morning, the party of the preceding evening a&s;&s;embled at breakfa&s;t, and were as gloomy and &s;ilent as before. The table was &s;pread by a boy of my father's; but the cook and the hou&s;e-maid, whatever they might be, were invi&s;ible.</P>
<P>The next morning, I was &s;urprized, on attempting to leave my chamber, to find the door locked; I waited a con&s;iderable time before I ventured to call; when I did, no an|&s;wer was returned; I then went to the win|dow, and called more loudly, but my own voice was &s;till the only &s;ound I heard. Near an hour I pa&s;&s;ed in a &s;tate of &s;urpri&s;e and ter|ror not to be de&s;cribed: at length, I heard a per&s;on coming up &s;tairs, and I renewed the call; I was an&s;wered, that my father had that morning &s;at off for Paris, whence he would return in a few days; in the mean meanwhile he had ordered me to be confined in my chamber. On my expre&s;&s;ing &s;urpri&s;e and apprehen&s;ion at this circum&s;tance, I was a&s;&s;ured I had no|thing to fear, and that I &s;hould live as well as if I was at liberty.</P>
<P>The latter part of this &s;peech &s;eemed to contain an odd kind of comfort; I made little reply, but &s;ubmitted to nece&s;&s;ity. Once more I was abandoned to &s;orrowful reflection;
<PB N="70" REF="72">
what a day was the one I now pa&s;&s;ed! alone, and agitated with grief and apprehen&s;ion. I endeavoured to conjecture the cau&s;e of this har&s;h treatment; and, at length concluded it was de&s;igned by my father, as a puni&s;hment for my former di&s;obedience. But why aban|don me to the power of &s;trangers, to men, who&s;e countenances bore the &s;tamp of villany &s;o &s;trongly as to impre&s;s even my inexperi|enced mind with terror! Surmi&s;e involved me only deeper in perplexity, yet I found it impo&s;&s;ible to forbear pur&s;uing the &s;ubject; and the day was divided between lamentation and conjecture. Night at length came, and &s;uch a night! Darkne&s;s brought new terrors: I looked round the chamber for &s;ome means of fa&s;tening my door on the in&s;ide, but could perceive none; at la&s;t I contrived to place the back of a chair in an oblique direction, &s;o as to render it &s;ecure.</P>
<P>I had &s;carcely done this, and laid down upon my bed in my cloaths, not to &s;leep, but to watch, when I heard a rap at the door of the hou&s;e, which was opened and &s;hut &s;o quickly, that the per&s;on who had knocked, &s;eemed only to deliver a letter or me&s;&s;age. Soon after, I heard voices at intervals in a room below &s;tairs, &s;ometimes &s;peaking very low, and &s;ometimes ri&s;ing, all together, as if in di&s;pute. Something more excu&s;able than
<PB N="71" REF="73">
curio&s;ity made me endeavour to di&s;tingui&s;h what was &s;aid, but in vain; now and then a word or two reached me, and once I heard my name repeated, but no more.</P>
<P>Thus pa&s;&s;ed the hours till midnight, when all became &s;till. I had laid for &s;ome time in a &s;tate between fear and hope, when I heard the lock of my door gently moved backward and forward; I &s;tarted up, and li&s;tened; for a moment it was &s;till, then the noi&s;e returned, and I heard a whi&s;pering without; my &s;pirits died away, but I was yet &s;en&s;ible. Pre&s;ently an effort was made at the door, as if to force it; I &s;hrieked aloud, and immediately heard the voices of the men I had &s;een at my father's table: they called loudly for the door to be opened, and on my returning no an&s;wer, ut|tered dreadful execrations. I had ju&s;t &s;trength &s;ufficient to move to the window, in the de&s;|perate hope of e&s;caping thence; but my fee|ble efforts could not even &s;hake the bars. O! how can I recollect the&s;e moments of horror, and be &s;ufficiently thankful that I am now in &s;afety and comfort!</P>
<P>They remained &s;ome time at the door, then they quitted it, and went down &s;tairs. How my heart revived at every &s;tep of their de|parture; I fell upon my knees, thanked God that he had pre&s;erved me this time, and im|plored his farther protection. I was ri&s;ing
<PB N="72" REF="74">
from this &s;hort prayer, when &s;uddenly I heard a noi&s;e in a different part of the room, and, on looking round, I perceived the door of a &s;mall clo&s;et open, and two men enter the chamber.</P>
<P>They &s;eized me, and I &s;unk &s;en&s;ele&s;s in their arms; how long I remained in this con|dition I known not, but on reviving, I percei|ved my&s;elf again alone, and heard &s;everal voices from below &s;tairs. I had pre&s;ence of mind to run to the door of the clo&s;et, my only chance of e&s;cape; but it was locked! I then recollected it was po&s;&s;ible, that the ruffi|ans might have forgot to turn the key of the chamber door, which was held by the chair; but here, al&s;o, I was di&s;appointed. I cla&s;ped my hands in an agony of de&s;pair, and &s;tood for &s;ome time immoveable.</P>
<P>A violent noi&s;e from below rou&s;ed me, and &s;oon after I heard people a&s;cending the &s;tairs: I now gave my&s;elf up for lo&s;t. The &s;teps ap|proached, the door of the clo&s;et was again un|locked. I &s;tood calmly, and again &s;aw the men enter the chamber; I neither &s;poke, nor re&s;i&s;ted: the faculties of my &s;oul were wrought up beyond the power of feeling; as a violent blow on the body &s;tuns for awhile the &s;en&s;e of pain. They led me down &s;tairs; the door of a room below was thrown open, and I be|held a &s;tranger; it was then that my &s;en&s;es
<PB N="73" REF="75">
returned; I &s;hrieked, and re&s;i&s;ted, but was forced along. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay that this &s;tranger was Mon&s;ieur La Motte, or to add, that I &s;hall for ever ble&s;s him as my deliverer.</P></Q>
<P>Adeline cea&s;ed to &s;peak; Madame La Motte remained &s;ilent. There were &s;ome circum&s;tan|ces in Adeline's narrative, which rai&s;ed all her curio&s;ity. She a&s;ked if Adeline believed her fa|ther to be a party in this my&s;terious affair. Ade|line, though it was impo&s;&s;ible to doubt that he had been principally and materially concerned in &s;ome part of it, thought, or &s;aid &s;he thought, he was innocent of any intention again&s;t her life. <Q REND="inline">"Yet, what motive,"</Q> &s;aid Madame La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"could there be for a degree of cruelty &s;o appa|rently unprofitable?"</Q> Here the inquiry ended; and Adeline confe&s;&s;ed &s;he had pur&s;ued it, till her mind &s;hrunk from all farther re&s;earch.</P>
<P>The &s;ympathy which &s;uch uncommon misfor|tune excited, Madame La Motte now expre&s;&s;ed without re&s;erve, and this expre&s;&s;ion of it, &s;trengthened the tye of mutual friend&s;hip. Ade|line felt her &s;pirit relieved by the di&s;clo&s;ure &s;he had made to Madame La Madame La Motte; and the latter acknowledged the value of the con|fidence, by an increa&s;e of affectionate attentions.</P>

<P>LA Motte had now pa&s;&s;ed above a month in this &s;eclu&s;ion; and his wife had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee him recover tranquillity and even cheerful|ne&s;s. In this plea&s;ure Adeline warmly parti|cipated; and &s;he might ju&s;tly have congratulated her&s;elf, as one cau&s;e of his re&s;toration; her cheerfulne&s;s and delicate attention had effected what Madame La Motte's greater anxiety had failed to accompli&s;h. La Motte did not &s;eem regardle&s;s of her amiable di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;ome|times thanked her in a manner more earne&s;t than was u&s;ual with him. She, in her turn, con|&s;idered him as her only protector, and now felt towards him the affection of a daughter.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="77">
The time &s;he had &s;pent in this peaceful re|tirement had &s;oftened the remembrance of pa&s;t events, and re&s;tored her mind to its natural tone; and when memory brought back to her view her former &s;hort and romantic expecta|tions of happine&s;s, though &s;he gave a &s;igh to the rapturous illu&s;ion, &s;he le&s;s lamented the di&s;appointment, than rejoiced in her pre&s;ent &s;e|curity and comfort.</P>
<P>But the &s;atisfaction which La Motte's cheer|fulne&s;s diffu&s;ed around him was of &s;hort conti|nuance; he became &s;uddenly gloomy and re|&s;erved; the &s;ociety of his family was no longer grateful to him; and he would &s;pend whole hours in the mo&s;t &s;ecluded parts of the fore&s;t, devoted to melanoholy and &s;ecret grief. He did not, as formerly, indulge the humour of his &s;adne&s;s, without re&s;traint, in the pre&s;ence of others; he now evidently endeavoured to con|ceal it, and affected a cheerfulne&s;s that was too artificial to e&s;cape detection.</P>
<P>His &s;ervant Peter, either impelled by curio|&s;ity or kindne&s;s, &s;ometimes followed him, un|&s;een, into the fore&s;t. He ob&s;erved him fre|quently retire to one particular &s;pot, in a remote part, which having gained, he always di&s;ap|peared, before Peter, who was obliged to follow at a di&s;tance, could exactly notice where. All his endeavours, now prompted by wonder and invigorated by di&s;appointment, were un&s;ucce&s;s|ful,
<PB N="76" REF="78">
and he was at length compelled to endure the tortures of un&s;atisfied curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>This change in the manners and habits of her hu&s;band was too con&s;picuous to pa&s;s unob|&s;erved by Madame La Motte, who endeavoured, by all the &s;tratagems which affection could &s;ug|ge&s;t, or female invention &s;upply, to win him to her confidence. He &s;eemed in&s;en&s;ible to the influence of the fir&s;t, and with&s;tood the wiles of the latter. Finding all her efforts in&s;ufficient to di&s;&s;ipate the glooms which overhung his mind, or to penetrate their &s;ecret cau&s;e, &s;he de&s;i&s;ted from farther attempt, and endeavoured to &s;ub|mit to this my&s;terious di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Week after week elap&s;ed, and the &s;ame un|known cau&s;e &s;ealed the lips and corroded the heart of La Motte. The place of his vi&s;itation in the fore&s;t had not been traced. Peter had frequently examined round the &s;pot where his ma&s;ter di&s;appeared, but had never di&s;covered any rece&s;s, which could be &s;uppo&s;ed to conceal him. The a&s;toni&s;hment of the &s;ervant was at length rai&s;ed to an in&s;upportable degree, and he communicated to his mi&s;tre&s;s the &s;ub|ject of it.</P>
<P>The emotion, which this information excited, &s;he di&s;gui&s;ed from Peter, and reproved him for the means he had taken to gratify his curio&s;ity. But &s;he revolved this circum&s;tance in her thoughts, and comparing it with the late altera|tion in his temper, her unea&s;ine&s;s was renewed,
<PB N="77" REF="79">
and her perplexity con&s;iderably increa&s;ed. After much con&s;ideration, being unable to a&s;&s;ign any other motive for his conduct, &s;he began to at|tribute it to the influence of illicit pa&s;&s;ion; and her heart, which now out-ran her judgment, confirmed the &s;uppo&s;ition, and rou&s;ed all the torturing pangs of jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>Comparatively &s;peaking, &s;he had never known affliction till now: &s;he had abandoned her deare&s;t friends and connections&mdash;had relinqui&s;hed the gaieties, the luxuries, and almo&s;t the ne|ce&s;&s;aries of life;&mdash;fled with her family into exile, an exile the mo&s;t dreary and comfortle&s;s; ex|periencing the evils of reality, and tho&s;e of apprehen&s;ion, united: all the&s;e &s;he had patiently endured, &s;upported by the affection of him, for who&s;e &s;ake &s;he &s;uffered. Though that affection, indeed, had for &s;ome time appeared to be aba|ted, &s;he had borne its decrea&s;e with fortitude: but the la&s;t &s;troke of calamity, hitherto with|held, now came with irre&s;i&s;tible force&mdash;the love, of which &s;he lamented the lo&s;s, &s;he now believed was transferred to another.</P>
<P>The operation of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion confu&s;es the powers of rea&s;on, and warps them to its own particular direction. Her u&s;ual degree of judge|ment, unoppo&s;ed by the influence of her heart, would probably have pointed out to Madame La Motte &s;ome circum&s;tances upon the &s;ubject of her di&s;tre&s;s, equivocal, if not contradictory to her &s;u&s;picions. No &s;uch circum&s;tances appeared
<PB N="78" REF="80">
to her, and &s;he did not long he&s;itate to decide, that Adeline was the object of her hu&s;band's at|tachment. Her beauty out of the que&s;tion, who el&s;e, indeed, could it be in a &s;pot thus &s;ecluded from the world?</P>
<P>The &s;ame cau&s;e de&s;troyed, almo&s;t at the &s;ame moment, her only remaining comfort; and, when &s;he wept that &s;he could no longer look for happine&s;s in the affection of La Motte, &s;he wept al&s;o, that &s;he could no longer &s;eek &s;olace in the friend&s;hip of Adeline. She had too great an e&s;teem for her to doubt, at fir&s;t, the integrity of her conduct, but, in &s;pite of rea&s;on, her heart no longer expanded to her with its u&s;ual warmth of kindne&s;s. She &s;hrunk from her confidence; and, as the &s;ecret broodings of jealou&s;y cheri&s;hed her &s;u&s;picions, &s;he became le&s;s kind to her, even in manner.</P>
<P>Adeline, ob&s;erving the change, at fir&s;t at|tributed it to accident, and afterwards to a tem|porary di&s;plea&s;ure, ari&s;ing from &s;ome little inadvertency in her conduct. She, therefore, increa&s;ed her a&s;&s;iduities; but, perceiving, contrary to all expectation, that her efforts to plea&s;e failed of their u&s;ual con&s;equence, and that the re&s;erve of Madame's manner rather increa&s;ed than abated, &s;he became &s;eriou&s;ly unea&s;y, and re&s;olved to &s;eek an explanation. This Madame La Motte as &s;e|dulou&s;ly avoided, and was for &s;ome time able to prevent. Adeline, however, too much inte|re&s;ted in the event to yield to delicate &s;cruples,
<PB N="79" REF="81">
pre&s;&s;ed the &s;ubject &s;o clo&s;ely, that Madame, at fir&s;t agitated and confu&s;ed, at length invented &s;ome idle excu&s;e, and laughed off the affair.</P>
<P>She now &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubduing all ap|pearance of re&s;erve towards Adeline; and though her art could not conquer the prejudices of pa&s;&s;ion, it taught her to a&s;&s;ume, with tolera|ble &s;ucce&s;s, the a&s;pect of kindne&s;s. Adeline was deceived, and was again at peace. Indeed, confidence in the &s;incerity and goodne&s;s of others was her weakne&s;s. But the pangs of &s;tifled jea|lou&s;y &s;truck deeper to the heart of Madame La Motte, and &s;he re&s;olved, at all events, to obtain &s;ome certainty upon the &s;ubject of her &s;u&s;pi|cions.</P>
<P>She now conde&s;cended to a meanne&s;s, which &s;he had before de&s;pi&s;ed, and ordered Peter to watch the &s;teps of his ma&s;ter, in order to di&s;co|ver, if po&s;&s;ible, the place of his vi&s;itation! So much did pa&s;&s;ion win upon her judgment, by time and indulgence, that &s;he &s;ometimes ventured even to doubt the integrity of Adeline, and after|wards proceeded to believe it po&s;&s;ible that the ob|ject of La Motte's rambles might be an a&s;&s;igna|tion with her. What &s;ugge&s;ted this conjecture was, that Adeline frequently took long walks alone in the fore&s;t, and &s;ometimes was ab&s;ent from the abbey for many hours. This circum|&s;tance, which Madame La Motte had at fir&s;t attributed to Adeline's fondne&s;s for the picture&s;|que
<PB N="80" REF="82">
beauties of nature, now operated forcibly upon her imagination, and &s;he could view it in no other ligh:, than as affording an opportunity for &s;ecret conver&s;ation with her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Peter obeyed the orders of his mi&s;tre&s;s with alacrity, for they were warmly &s;econded by his own curio&s;ity. All his endeavours were, how|ever, fruitle&s;s; he never dared to follow La Motte near enough to ob&s;erve the place of his la&s;t retreat. Her impatience thus heightened by delay, and her pa&s;&s;ion &s;timulated by difficulty, Madame La Motte now re&s;olved to apply to her hu&s;band for an explanation of his con|duct.</P>
<P>After &s;ome con&s;ideration, concerning the manner mo&s;t likely to &s;ucceed with him, &s;he went to La Motte, but when &s;he entered the room where he &s;at, forgetting all her concerted addre&s;s, &s;he fell at his feet, and was, for &s;ome moments, lo&s;t in tears. Surprized at her atti|tude and di&s;tre&s;s, he inquired the occa&s;ion of it, and was an&s;wered, that it was cau&s;ed by his own conduct. <Q REND="inline">"My conduct!

be blamed for it by tho&s;e, whom he would &s;ave from the pain of &s;haring it?"</Q></P>
<P>Having uttered the&s;e words, he quitted the room, leaving Madame La Motte lo&s;t in &s;ur|prize, but &s;omewhat relieved from the pre&s;&s;ure of her former &s;u&s;picions. Still, however, &s;he pur&s;ued Adeline with an eye of &s;crutiny; and the ma&s;k of kindne&s;s would &s;ometimes fall off, and di&s;cover the features of di&s;tru&s;t. Adeline, without exactly knowing why, felt le&s;s at ea&s;e and le&s;s happy in her pre&s;ence than formerly; her &s;pirits drooped, and &s;he would often, when alone, weep at the forlornne&s;s of her condition. Formerly, her remembrance of pa&s;t &s;ufferings was lo&s;t in the friend&s;hip of Madame La Motte; now, though her behaviour was too guarded to betray any &s;triking in&s;tance of unkindne&s;s, there was &s;omething in her manner which chilled the hopes of Adeline, unable as &s;he was to analy&s;e it. But a circum&s;tance, which &s;oon occurred, &s;u&s;pended, for a while, the jealou&s;y of Madame La Motte, and rou&s;ed her hu&s;band from his &s;tate of gloomy &s;tupefaction.</P>
<P>Peter, having been one day to Auboine, for the weekly &s;upply of provi&s;ions, returned with intelligence that awakened in La Motte new apprehen&s;ion and anxiety.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh, Sir! I've heard &s;omething that has a&s;toni&s;hed me, as well it may,"</Q> cried Peter, <Q REND="inline">"and &s;o it will you, when you come to know it. As I was &s;tanding in the black&s;mith's

&s;hop, while the &s;mith was driving a nail into the hor&s;e's &s;hoe (by the bye, the hor&s;e lo&s;t it in an odd way, I'll tell you, Sir, how it was)"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nay, prithee leave it till another time, and go on with your &s;tory."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why then, Sir, as I was &s;tanding in the black&s;mith's &s;hop, comes in a man with a pipe in his mouth, and a large pouch of tobacco in his hand"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well&mdash;what has the pipe to do with the &s;tory?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, you put me out; I can't go on, unle&s;s you let me tell it my own way. As I was &s;aying&mdash;with a pipe in his mouth&mdash;I think I was there, your Honour!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, yes."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He &s;ets him&s;elf down on the bench, and, taking the pipe from his mouth, &s;ays to the black&s;mith&mdash;Neighbour, do you know any body of the name of La Motte hereabouts?&mdash;Ble&s;s your Honour, I turned all of a cold &s;weat in a minute!&mdash;Is not your Honour well, &s;hall I fetch you any thing?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No&mdash;but be &s;hort in your narrative."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"La Motte! La Motte!" &s;aid the black|&s;mith, "I think I've heard the name."&mdash;"Have you?" &s;aid I, "you're cunning then, for there's no &s;uch per&s;on hereabouts, to my know|ledge."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="85">
<Q REND="inline">"Fool! why did you &s;ay that?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e I did not want them to know your Honour was here; and if I had not managed very cleverly, they would have found me out. "There is no &s;uch per&s;on, hereabouts, to my knowledge," &s;ays I,"&mdash;"Indeed!" &s;ays the black&s;mith, "you know more of the neigh|bourhood than I do then."&mdash;"Aye," &s;ays the man with the pipe, "that's very true How came you to know &s;o much of the neighbour|hood? I came here twenty-&s;ix years ago, come next St. Michael, and you know more than I do. How came you to know &s;o much?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"With that he put his pipe in his mouth, and gave a whiff full in my face. Lord! your Honour, I trembled from head to foot. "Nay, as for that matter," &s;ays I, "I don't know more than other people, but I'm &s;ure I never heard of &s;uch a man as that."&mdash;"Pray," &s;ays the black+&s;mith, &s;taring me full in the face, "an't you the man that was enquiring &s;ome time &s;ince about St. Clair's Abbey?"&mdash;"Well, wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> of that?" &s;ays I, "what does that prove?"&mdash;"Why, they &s;ay, &s;omebody lives in the abbey now," &s;aid the man, turning to the other; "and<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> for aught I know, it may be this &s;ame L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Motte."&mdash;"Aye, or for aught I know ei|ther," &s;ays the man with the pipe, getting up from the bench, "and you know more of this
<PB N="84" REF="86">
than you'll own. I'll lay my my life on't, this Mon&s;ieur La Motte lives at the abbey."&mdash;"Aye," &s;ays I, "you are out there, for he does not live at the abbey now."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Confound your folly!"</Q> cried La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"but be quick&mdash;how did the matter end?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My ma&s;ter does not live there now," &s;aid I.&mdash;"Oh! oh!" &s;aid the man with the pipe; "he is your ma&s;ter, then? And pray how long has he left the abbey&mdash;and where does he live now?" "Hold," &s;aid I, "not &s;o fa&s;t&mdash;I know when to &s;peak and when to hold my tongue&mdash;but who has been inquiring for him?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What! he expected &s;omebody to inquire for him?" &s;ays the man.&mdash;"No," &s;ays I, "he did not, but if he did, what does that prove?&mdash;that argues nothing." With that he looked at the black&s;mith, and they went out of the &s;hop together, leaving my hor&s;e's &s;hoe undone. But I never minded that, for the moment they were gone, I mounted and rode away as fa&s;t as I could. But in my fright, your Honour, I forgot to take the round about way, and &s;o came &s;traight home."</Q></P>
<P>La Motte, extremely &s;hocked at Peter's in|telligence, made no other reply than by cur&s;ing his folly, and immediately went in &s;earch of Madame, who was walking with Adeline on the banks of the river. La Motte was too much agitated to &s;often his information by preface. <Q REND="inline">"We are di&s;covered!"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"the King's
<PB N="85" REF="87">
officers have been inquiring for me at Au|boine, and Peter has plundered upon my ruin."</Q> He then informed her of what Peter had re|lated, and bade her prepare to quit the abbey.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But whither can we fly?"</Q> &s;aid Madame La Motte, &s;carcely able to &s;upport her&s;elf. <Q REND="inline">"Any where!"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"to &s;tay here is cer|tain de&s;truction. We mu&s;t take refuge in Switzerland, I think. If any part of France would have concealed me, &s;urely it had been this!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Alas, how are we per&s;ecuted!"</Q> rejoined Madame. <Q REND="inline">"This &s;pot is &s;carcely made com|fortable, before we are obliged to leave it, and go we know not whither."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I wi&s;h we may not yet know whither,"</Q> re|plied La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"that is the lea&s;t evil that threatens us. Let us e&s;cape a pri&s;on, and I care not whither we go. But return to the abbey immediately, and pack up what move|ables you can."</Q> A flood of tears came to the relief of Madame La Motte, and &s;he hung upon Adeline's arm, &s;ilent and trembling. Adeline, though &s;he had no comfort to be&s;tow, endea|voured to command her feelings and appear com|po&s;ed. <Q REND="inline">"Come,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"we wa&s;te time; let us lament hereafter, but at pre&s;ent prepare for flight. Exert a little of that fortitude, which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for our pre&s;ervation. Adeline does not weep, yet
<PB N="86" REF="88">
her &s;tate is as wretched as your own, for I know not how long I &s;hall be able to pro|tect her."</Q></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding her terror, this reproof touched the pride of Madame La Motte, who dried her tears, but di&s;dained to reply, and looked at Adeline with a &s;trong expre&s;&s;ion of di&s;plea&s;ure. As they moved &s;ilently toward the abbey, Adeline a&s;ked La Motte if he was &s;ure they were the king's officers, who inquired for him. <Q REND="inline">"I cannot doubt it,"</Q> he replied, <Q REND="inline">"who el&s;e could po&s;&s;ibly inquire for me? Be&s;ides the behaviour of the man, who mentioned my name, puts the matter beyond a que&s;tion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Perhaps not,"</Q> &s;aid Madame La Motte: <Q REND="inline">"let us wait till morning ere we &s;et off. We may then find it will be unnece&s;&s;ary to go."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"We may, indeed; the king's officers would probably by that time have told us as much."&mdash;</Q>La Motte went to give orders to Peter. <Q REND="inline">"Set off in an hour,"</Q> &s;aid Peter. <Q REND="inline">"Lord ble&s;s you, ma&s;ter! only con&s;ider the coach wheel; it would take me a day at lea&s;t to mend it for your Honour knows I never mended one in my life."</Q></P>
<P>This was a circum&s;tance which La Motte had entirely overlooked. When they &s;ettled at the abbey, Peter had at fir&s;t been too bu&s;y in repair|ing the apartments, to remember the carriage, and afterwards, believing it would not quickly
<PB N="87" REF="89">
be wanted, he had neglected to do it. La Motte's temper now entirely for&s;ook him, and with many execrations ordered Peter to go to work immediately; but on &s;earching for the ma|terials formerly bought, they were no where to be found, and Peter at length remembered, though he was prudent enough to conceal this circum&s;tance, that he had u&s;ed the nails in re|pairing the abbey.</P>
<P>It was now, therefore, impo&s;&s;ible to quit the fore&s;t that night, and La Motte had only to con&s;ider the mo&s;t probable plan of concealment, &s;hould the officers of ju&s;tice vi&s;it the ruin before the morning; a circum&s;tance, which the thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s of Peter in returning from Au|boine, by the &s;traight way, made not unlikely.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, indeed, it occurred to him, that, though his family could not be removed, he might him|&s;elf take one of the hor&s;es, and e&s;cape from the fore&s;t before night. But he thought there would &s;till be &s;ome danger of detection in the towns through which he mu&s;t pa&s;s, and he could not well bear the idea of leaving his family unpro|tected, without knowing when he could return to them, or whither he could direct them to follow him. La Motte was not a man of very vigorous re&s;olution, and he was, perhaps, rather more willing to &s;uffer in company than alone.</P>
<P>After much con&s;ideration, he recollected the trap-door of the clo&s;et belonging to the cham|bers above. It was invi&s;ible to the eye, and
<PB N="88" REF="90">
whatever might be its direction, it would &s;e|curely &s;helter <HI>him,</HI> at lea&s;t, from di&s;covery. Having deliberated farther upon the &s;ubject, he determined to explore the rece&s;s to which the &s;tairs led, and thought it po&s;&s;ible, that for a &s;hort time his whole family might be concealed within it. There was little time between the &s;ugge&s;tion of the plan and the execution of his purpo&s;e, for darkne&s;s was &s;preading around, and, in every murmur of the wind, he thought he heard the voices of his enemies.</P>
<P>He called for a light and a&s;cended alone to the chamber. When he came to the clo&s;et, it was &s;ome time before he could find the trap|door, &s;o exactly did it corre&s;pond with the boards of the floor. At length, he found and rai&s;ed it. The chill damps of long confined air ru&s;hed from the aperture, and he &s;tood for a moment to let them pa&s;s, ere he de&s;cended. As he &s;tood looking down the aby&s;s, he recollected the report, which Peter had brought concerning the abbey, and it gave him an unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation: But this &s;oon yielded to more pre&s;&s;ing intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>The &s;tairs were &s;teep, and in many places trembled beneath his weight. Having conti|nued to de&s;cend for &s;ome time, his feet touched the ground, and he found him&s;elf in a narrow pa&s;&s;age; but as he turned to pur&s;ue it, the damp vapours curled round him and extin|gui&s;hed the light. He called aloud for Peter, but could make nobody hear, and after &s;ome
<PB N="89" REF="91">
time, he endeavoured to find his way up the &s;tairs. In this, with difficulty, he &s;ucceeded, and, pa&s;&s;ing the chambers with cautious &s;teps, de&s;cended the tower.</P>
<P>The &s;ecurity, which the place he had ju&s;t quitted &s;eemed to promi&s;e, was of too much im|portance to be &s;lightly rejected, and he deter|mined immediately to make another experiment with the light:&mdash;having now fixed it in a lan|thorn, he de&s;cended a &s;econd time to the pa&s;&s;age. The current of vapours occa&s;ioned by the open|ing of the trap-door, was abated, and the fre&s;h air thence admitted had began to circulate: La Motte pa&s;&s;ed on unmole&s;ted.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age was of con&s;iderable length, and led him to a door, which was fa&s;tened. He pla|ced the lanthorn at &s;ome di&s;tance to avoid the current of air, and applied his &s;trength to the door. It &s;hook under his hands, but did not yield. Upon examining it more clo&s;ely, he per|ceived the wood round the lock was decayed, probably by the damps, and this encouraged him to proceed. After &s;ome time it gave way to his effort, and he found him&s;elf in a &s;quare &s;tone room.</P>
<P>He &s;tood for &s;ome time to &s;urvey it. The walls, which were dripping with unwhole&s;ome dews, were entirely bare and afforded not even a window. A &s;mall iron grate alone admitted the air. At the further end, near a low rece&s;s, was another door. La Motte went towards it,
<PB N="90" REF="92">
and, as he pa&s;&s;ed, looked into the rece&s;s. Upon the ground within it, &s;tood a large che&s;t, which he went forward to examine, and, lifting the lid, he &s;aw the remains of a human &s;keleton. Hor|ror &s;truck upon his heart, and he involuntarily &s;tepped back. During a pau&s;e of &s;ome moments, his fir&s;t emotions &s;ub&s;ided. That thrilling curi|o&s;ity, which objects of terror often excite in the human mind, impelled him to take a &s;econd view of this di&s;mal &s;pectacle.</P>
<P>La Motte &s;tood motionle&s;s as he gazed; the object before him &s;eemed to confirm the report that &s;ome per&s;on had formerly been murdered in the abbey. At length he clo&s;ed the che&s;t, and advanced to the &s;econd door, which al&s;o was fa&s;|tened, but the key was in the lock. He turned it with difficulty, and then found the door was held by two &s;trong bolts. Having undrawn the&s;e, it di&s;clo&s;ed a &s;light of &s;teps, which he de|&s;cended. They terminated in a chain of low vaults, or rather cells, that, from the manner of their con&s;truction and pre&s;ent condition, &s;eemed to have been coeval with the mo&s;t ancient parts of the abbey. La Motte, in his then depre&s;&s;ed &s;tate of mind, thought them the burial places of the monks, who formerly inhabited the pile above; but they were more calculated for places of pe|nance for the living, than of re&s;t for the dead.</P>
<P>Having reached the extremity of the&s;e cells, the way was again clo&s;ed by a door. La Motte now he&s;itated whether he &s;hould attempt to
<PB N="91" REF="93">
any farther. The pre&s;ent &s;pot &s;eemed to afford the &s;ecurity he &s;ought. Here he might pa&s;s the night unmole&s;ted by apprehen&s;ion of di&s;covery, and it was mo&s;t probable, that if the officers ar|rived in the night, and found the abbey vacated, they would quit it before morning, or, at lea&s;t, before he could have any occa&s;ion to emerge from concealment. The&s;e con&s;iderations re|&s;tored his mind to a &s;tate of greater compo&s;ure. His only immediate care was to bring his family, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, to this place of &s;ecurity, le&s;t the officers &s;hould come unawares upon them; and, while he &s;tood thus mu&s;ing, he blamed him|&s;elf for delay.</P>
<P>But an irre&s;i&s;tible de&s;ire of knowing to what this door led, arre&s;ted his &s;teps, and he turned to open it. The door, however, was fa&s;tened, and, as he attempted to force it, he &s;uddenly thought he heard a noi&s;e above. It now occurred to him, that the officers might already have arrived, and he quitted the cells with precipi|tation, intending to li&s;ten at the trap-door.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"There,"</Q> &s;aid he,<Q REND="inline">" I may wait in &s;ecurity, and perhaps hear &s;omething of what pa&s;&s;es. My family will not be known, or, at lea&s;t, not hurt, and their unea&s;ine&s;s on my account, they mu&s;t learn to endure."</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e were the arguments of La Motte, in which, it mu&s;t be owned, &s;elfi&s;h prudence was more con&s;picuous than tender anxiety for his wife. He had by this time reached the bottom
<PB N="92" REF="94">
of the &s;tairs, when, on looking up, he perceived the trap-door was left open, and a&s;cending in ha&s;te to clo&s;e it, he heard foot&s;teps advancing through the chambers above. Before he could a&s;cend entirely out of &s;ight, he again looked up and perceived through the aperture the face of a man looking down upon him. <Q REND="inline">"Ma&s;ter,"</Q> cried Peter;&mdash;La Motte was &s;omewhat relieved at the &s;ound of his voice, though angry that he had occa&s;ioned him &s;o much terror.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What brings you here, and what is the matter below?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nothing, Sir, nothing's the matter, only my mi&s;tre&s;s &s;ent me to &s;ee after your Honour."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"There's nobody there then,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"&s;etting his foot upon the &s;tep."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, there is my mi&s;tre&s;s and Ma|demoi&s;elle Adeline and"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well&mdash;well"</Q> &s;aid La Motte bri&s;kly&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"go your ways, I am coming."</Q></P>
<P>He informed Madame La Motte where he had been, and of his intention of &s;ecreting him|&s;elf, and deliberated upon the means of con|vincing the officers, &s;hould they arrive, that he had quitted the abbey. For this purpo&s;e, he ordered all the moveable furniture to be conveyed to the cells below. La Motte him&s;elf a&s;&s;i&s;ted in this bu&s;ine&s;s, and every hand was employed for di&s;patch. In a very &s;hort time, the habita|ble part of the fabric was left almo&s;t as de&s;olate as he had found it. He then bade Peter take
<PB N="93" REF="95">
the hor&s;es to a di&s;tance from the abbey, and turn them loo&s;e. After farther con&s;ideration, he thought it might contribute to mi&s;lead them, if he placed in &s;ome con&s;picuous part of the fabric an in&s;cription, &s;ignifying his condition, and mentioning the date of his departure from the abbey. Over the door of the tower, which led to the habitable part of the &s;tructure, he, there|fore, cut the following lines.
<Q><L>"O ye! whom misfortune may lead to this &s;pot,</L>
<L>"Learn that there are others as mi&s;erable as your|&s;elves."</L>
<P>P&mdash;L&mdash;M&mdash; a wretched exile, &s;ought within the&s;e walls a refuge from per&s;ecution, on the 27th of April 1658, and quitted them on the 12th of July in the &s;ame year, in &s;earch of a more convenient a&s;ylum.</P></Q>
After engraving the&s;e words with a knife, the &s;mall &s;tock of provi&s;ions remaining from the week's &s;upply (for Peter, in his fright, had returned unloaded from his la&s;t journey) was put into a ba&s;ket, and, La Motte having a&s;|&s;embled his family, they all a&s;cended the &s;tairs of the tower and pa&s;&s;ed through the chambers to the clo&s;et. Peter went fir&s;t with a light, and with &s;ome difficulty found the trap-door. Madame La Motte &s;huddered as &s;he &s;urveyed the gloomy aby&s;s; but they were all &s;ilent.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="96">
La Motte now took the light and led the way; Madame followed, and then Adeline. <Q REND="inline">"The&s;e old monks loved good wine, as well as other people,"</Q> &s;aid Peter, who brought up the rear, <Q REND="inline">"I warrant your Honour, now, this was their cellar; I &s;mell the ca&s;ks already."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Peace,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"re&s;erve your jokes for a proper occa&s;ion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"There is no harm in loving good wine, as your Honour knows."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Have done with this buffoonery,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte, in a tone more authoritative, <Q REND="inline">"and go fir&s;t."</Q> Peter obeyed.</P>
<P>They came to the vaulted room. The di&s;mal &s;pectacle he had &s;een there, deterred La Motte from pa&s;&s;ing the night in this chamber; and the furniture had, by his own order, been con|veyed to the cells below. He was anxious that his family &s;hould not perceive the &s;keleton; an object, which would, probably, excite a degree of horror not to be overcome during their &s;tay. La Motte now pa&s;&s;ed the che&s;t in ha&s;te; and Madame La Motte and Adeline were too much engro&s;&s;ed by their own thoughts, to give minute attention to external circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>When they reached the cells, Madame La Motte wept at the nece&s;&s;ity which condemned her to a &s;pot &s;o di&s;mal. <Q REND="inline">"Alas,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"are we, indeed, thus reduced! The apart|ments above, formerly appeared to me a de|plorable
<PB N="95" REF="97">
habitation; but they are a palace compared to the&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"True, my dear,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"and let the remembrance of what you once thought them, &s;oothe your di&s;content now; the&s;e cells are al&s;o a palace, compared to the Bic&egrave;tre, or the Ba&s;tille, and to the terrors of farther puni&s;hment, which would accompany them: let the apprehen&s;ion of the greater evil teach you to endure the le&s;s: I am contented if we find here the refuge I &s;eek."</Q></P>
<P>Madame La Motte was &s;ilent, and Adeline, forgetting her late unkindne&s;s, endeavoured as much as &s;he could to con&s;ole her; while her heart was &s;inking with the misfortunes, which &s;he could not but anticipate, &s;he appeared compo&s;ed, and even cheerful. She attended Madame La Motte with the mo&s;t watchful &s;olicitude, and felt &s;o thankful that La Motte was now &s;ecreted within this rece&s;s, that &s;he almo&s;t lo&s;t her per|ception of its glooms and inconveniences.</P>
<P>This &s;he artle&s;sly expre&s;&s;ed to him, who could not be in&s;en&s;ible to the tenderne&s;s it di&s;|covered. Madame La Motte was al&s;o &s;en&s;ible of it, and it renewed a painful &s;en&s;ation. The effu&s;ions of gratitude &s;he mi&s;took for tho&s;e of tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>La Motte returned frequently to the trap door, to li&s;ten if any body was in the abbey; but no &s;ound di&s;turbed the &s;tillne&s;s of night; at
<PB N="96" REF="98">
length they &s;at down to &s;upper; the repa&s;t was a melancholy one. <Q REND="inline">"If the officers do not come hither to night,"</Q> &s;aid Madame La Motte, &s;ighing, <Q REND="inline">"&s;uppo&s;e, my dear, Peter returns to Auboine to-morrow. He may there learn &s;omething more of this affair; or, at lea&s;t, he might procure a carriage to convey us hence."</Q></P>

Peter would be an excellent per&s;on to &s;hew the of|ficers the way to the abbey, and to inform them of what they might el&s;e be in doubt about, my concealment here."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How cruel is this irony!"</Q> replied Madame La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"I propo&s;ed only what I thought would be for our mutual good; my judge|ment was, perhaps, wrong, but my intention was certainly right."</Q> Tears &s;welled into her eyes as &s;he &s;poke the&s;e words. Adeline wi&s;hed to relieve her; but delicacy kept her &s;ilent. La Motte ob&s;erved the effect of his &s;peech, and &s;omething like remor&s;e touched his heart, He approached, and taking her hand, <Q REND="inline">"You mu&s;t allow for the perturbation of my mind,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"I did not mean to afflict you thus. The idea of &s;ending Peter to Auboine, where he has already done &s;o much harm by his blun|ders, tea&s;ed me, and I could not let it pa&s;s unnoticed. No, my dear, our only chance of &s;afety is to remain where we are while our

provi&s;ions la&s;t. If the officers do not come here to-night, they probably will to-morrow, or, perhaps, the next day. When they have &s;earched the abbey, without finding me, they will depart; we may then emerge from this rece&s;s, and take mea&s;ures for removing to a di&s;tant country."</Q></P>
<P>Madame La Motte acknowledged the ju&s;tice of his words, and her mind being relieved by the little apology he had made, &s;he became tolerably cheerful. Supper being ended, La Motte &s;ta|tioned the faithful, though &s;imple Peter, at the foot of the &s;teps that a&s;cended to the clo&s;et; there to keep watch during the night. Having done this, he returned to the lower cells, where he had left his little family. The beds were &s;pread, and having mournfully bid each other good night, they laid down, and implored re&s;t.</P>
<P>Adeline's thoughts were too bu&s;y to &s;uffer her to repo&s;e, and when &s;he believed her companions were &s;unk in &s;lumbers, &s;he indulged the &s;orrow which reflection brought. She al&s;o looked for|ward to the future with the mo&s;t mournful ap|prehen&s;ion. <Q REND="inline">"Should La Motte be &s;eized, what was to become of her? She would then be a wanderer in the wide world; without friends to protect, or money to &s;upport her; the pro&s;pect was gloomy&mdash;was terrible!"</Q> She &s;urveyed it and &s;huddered! The di&s;tre&s;&s;es too of Mon&s;ieur and Madame La Motte, whom &s;he
<PB N="98" REF="100">
loved with the mo&s;t lively affection, formed no incon&s;iderable part of her's.</P>
<P>Sometimes &s;he looked back to her father; but in him &s;he only &s;aw an enemy, from whom &s;he mu&s;t fly; this remembrance heightened her &s;orrow; yet it was not the recollection of the &s;uffering he had occa&s;ioned her, by which &s;he was &s;o much afflicted, as by the &s;en&s;e of his un|kindne&s;s: &s;he wept bitterly. At length, with that artle&s;s piety, which innocence only knows, &s;he addre&s;&s;ed the Supreme Being, and re&s;igned her&s;elf to his care. Her mind then gradually became peaceful and re-a&s;&s;ured, and &s;oon after &s;he &s;unk to repo&s;e.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>A Surprize&mdash;An Adventure&mdash;A My&s;tery.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE night pa&s;&s;ed without any alarm; Peter had remained upon his po&s;t, and heard nothing that prevented his &s;leeping. La Motte heard him, long before he &s;aw him, mo&s;t mu&s;ically &s;noring; though it mu&s;t be owned there was more of the ba&s;s, than of any other part of the gamut in his performance. He was &s;oon rou&s;ed by the <HI>bravura</HI> of La Motte, who&s;e notes &s;ound|ed di&s;cord to his ears, and de&s;troyed the torpor of his tranquillity.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"God ble&s;s you, Ma&s;ter, what's the mat|ter?"</Q> cried Peter, waking, <Q REND="inline">"are they come?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, for aught you care, they might be come. Did I place you here to &s;leep, &s;irrah?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ble&s;s you, Ma&s;ter,"</Q> returned Peter, <Q REND="inline">"&s;leep is the only comfort to be had here; I'm &s;ure I would not deny it to a dog in &s;uch a place as this."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="102">
La Motte &s;ternly que&s;tioned him concerning any noi&s;e he might have heard in the night; and Peter full as &s;olemnly prote&s;ted he had heard none; an a&s;&s;ertion which was &s;trictly true, for he had enjoyed the comfort of being a&s;leep the whole time.</P>
<P>La Motte a&s;cended to the trap-door and li&s;ten|ed attentively. No &s;ounds were heard, and, as he ventured to lift it, the full light of the &s;un bur&s;t upon his &s;ight, the morning being now &s;ar advanced; he walked &s;oftly along the cham|bers, and looked through a window; no per|&s;on was to be &s;een. Encouraged by this appa|rent &s;ecurity, he ventured down the &s;tairs of the tower, and entered the fir&s;t apartment. He was proceeding towards the &s;econd, when, &s;ud|denly recollecting him&s;elf, he fir&s;t peeped through the crevice of the door, which &s;tood half open. He looked, and di&s;tinctly &s;aw a per&s;on &s;itting near the window, upon which his arm re&s;ted.</P>
<P>The di&s;covery &s;o much &s;hocked him, that for a moment he lo&s;t all pre&s;ence of mind, and was utterly unable to move from the &s;pot. The per&s;on, who&s;e back was towards him, aro&s;e, and turned his head. La Motte now recovered him|&s;elf, and quitting the apartment as quickly, and, at the &s;ame time, as &s;ilently as po&s;&s;ible, a&s;cended to the clo&s;et. He rai&s;ed the trap-door, but be|fore he clo&s;ed it, heard the foot&s;teps of a per&s;on entering the outer chamber. Bolts, or other
<PB N="101" REF="103">
fa&s;tening to the trap there was none; and his &s;e|curity depended &s;olely upon the exact corre&s;pon|dence of the boards. The outer door of the &s;tone room had no means of defence; and the fa&s;ten|ings of the inner one were on the wrong &s;ide to afford &s;ecurity, even till &s;ome means of e&s;cape could be found.</P>
<P>When he reached this room, he pau&s;ed, and heard di&s;tinctly, per&s;ons walking in the clo&s;et above. While he was li&s;tening, he heard a voice call him by name, and he in&s;tantly fled to the cells below, expecting every moment to hear the trap lifted, and the foot&s;teps of pur&s;uit; but he was fled beyond the reach of hearing either. Having thrown him&s;elf on the ground, at the farthe&s;t extremity of the vaults, he lay for &s;ome time breathle&s;s with agitation. Madame La Motte and Adeline, in the utmo&s;t terror, inquired what had happened. It was &s;ome time before he could &s;peak; when he did, it was almo&s;t unne|ce&s;&s;ary, for the di&s;tant noi&s;es, which &s;ounded from above, informed his family of a part of the truth.</P>
<P>The &s;ounds did not &s;eem to approach, but Madame La Motte, unable to command her terror, &s;hrieked aloud: this redoubled the di&s;|tre&s;s of La Motte. <Q REND="inline">"You have already de|&s;troyed me,"</Q> cried he; <Q REND="inline">"that &s;hriek has inform|ed them where I am."</Q> He traver&s;ed the cells with cla&s;ped hands and quick &s;teps. Adeline
<PB N="102" REF="104">
&s;tood pale and &s;till as death, &s;upporting Ma|dame La Motte, whom, with difficulty, &s;he prevented from fainting. <Q REND="inline">"O! Dupras! Du|pras! you are already avenged!"</Q> &s;aid he, in a voice that &s;eemed to bur&s;t from his heart: there was a pau&s;e of &s;ilence. <Q REND="inline">"But why &s;hould I deceive my&s;elf with a hope of e&s;caping?"</Q> he re&s;umed, <Q REND="inline">"why do I wait here for their coming? Let me rather end the&s;e torturing pangs by throwing my&s;elf into their hands at once."</Q></P>
<P>As he &s;poke, he moved towards the door, but the di&s;tre&s;s of La Motte arre&s;ted his &s;teps. <Q REND="inline">"Stay,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"for my &s;ake, &s;tay; do not leave me thus, nor throw your&s;elf voluntarily into de&s;truction!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Surely, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline, <Q REND="inline">"you are too precipitate; this de&s;pair is u&s;ele&s;s, as it is ill|founded. We hear no per&s;on approaching; if the officers had di&s;covered the trap-door, they would certainly have been here before now."</Q> The words of Adeline &s;tilled the tu|mult of his mind: the agitation of terror &s;ub&s;i|ded; and rea&s;on beamed a feeble ray upon his hopes. He li&s;tened attentively, and perceiving that all was &s;ilent, advanced with caution to the &s;tone room; and thence to the foot of the &s;tairs that led to the trap-door. It was clo&s;ed: no &s;ound was heard above.</P>
<P>He watched a long time, and the &s;ilence con|tinuing, his hopes &s;trengthened, and, at length
<PB N="103" REF="105">
he began to believe that the officers had quitted the abbey; the day however was &s;pent in anx|ious watchfulne&s;s. He did not dare to unclo&s;e the trap-door; and he frequently thought he heard di&s;tant noi&s;es. It was evident, however, that the &s;ecret of the clo&s;et had e&s;caped di&s;co|very; and on this circum&s;tance he ju&s;tly founded his &s;ecurity. The following night was pa&s;&s;e I like the day, in trembling hope, and ince&s;&s;ant watching.</P>
<P>But the nece&s;&s;ities of hunger now threatened them. The provi&s;ions which had been di&s;tribu|ted with the nice&s;t oeconomy, were nearly ex|hau&s;ted, and the mo&s;t deplorable con&s;equences might be expected from their remaining longer in concealment. Thus circum&s;tanced, La Motte deliberated upon the mo&s;t prudent method of proceeding. There appeared no other alterna|tive, than to &s;end Peter to Auboine, the only town from which he could return within the time pre&s;cribed by their nece&s;&s;ities. There was game, indeed, in the fore&s;t; but Peter could neither handle a gun, or u&s;e a fi&s;hing rod to any advantage.</P>
<P>It was, therefore, agreed he &s;hould go to Au|boine for a &s;upply of provi&s;ions, and at the &s;ame time bring materials for mending the coach wheel, that they might have &s;ome ready conveyance from the fore&s;t. La Motte forbade Peter to a&s;k any que&s;tions concerning the people who had inquired for him, or take any methods for di&s;covering
<PB N="104" REF="106">
whether they had quitted the country, le&s;t his blunders &s;hould again betray him. He ordered him to be entirely &s;ilent as to the&s;e &s;ubjects, and leave the place with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch.</P>
<P>A difficulty yet remained to be overcome&mdash;Who &s;hould fir&s;t venture abroad into the abbey, to learn, whether it was vacated by the officers of ju&s;tice? La Motte con&s;idered, that if he was again &s;een, he &s;hould be effectually betrayed; which would not be <HI>&s;o</HI> certain, if one of his fa|mily was ob&s;erved, for they were all unknown to the officers. It was nece&s;&s;ary, however, that the per&s;on he &s;ent &s;hould have courage enough to go through with the inquiry, and wit enough to conduct it with caution. Peter, perhaps, had the fir&s;t; but was certainly de&s;titute of the la&s;t. Annette had neither La Motte looked at his wife, and a&s;ked her, if, for his &s;ake, &s;he da|red to venture. Her heart &s;hrunk from the pro|po&s;al, yet &s;he was unwilling to refu&s;e, or appear indifferent upon a point &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the &s;afety of her hu&s;band. Adeline ob&s;erved in her coun|tenance the agitation of her mind, and &s;urmoun|ting the fears, which had hitherto kept her &s;ilent, &s;he offered her&s;elf to go.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"They will be le&s;s likely to offend me,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"than a man."</Q> Shame would not &s;uffer La Motte to accept her offer; and Madame, touched by the magnanimity of her conduct, felt a momentary renewal of all her former kindne&s;s. Adeline pre&s;&s;ed her propo&s;al &s;o warmly, and
<PB N="105" REF="107">
&s;eemed &s;o much in earne&s;t, that La Motte began to he&s;itate. <Q REND="inline">"You, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"once pre&s;erved me from the mo&s;t imminent danger, and your kindne&s;s has &s;ince protected me. Do not refu&s;e me the &s;atisfaction of de&s;erving your goodne&s;s by a grateful return of it. Let me go into the abbey, and if, by &s;o doing, I &s;hould pre&s;erve you from evil, I &s;hall be &s;ufficiently rewarded for what little danger I may incur, for my plea&s;ure will be at lea&s;t equal to yours."</Q></P>
<P>Madame La Motte could &s;carcely refrain from tears as Adeline &s;poke; and La Motte, &s;ighing deeply, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Well, be it &s;o; go, Adeline, and from this moment con&s;ider me as your debtor."</Q> Adeline &s;tayed not to reply, but taking a light, quitted the cells, La Motte following to rai&s;e the trap-door, and cautioning her to look, if po&s;&s;ible, into every apartment, before &s;he entered it. <Q REND="inline">"If you <HI>&s;hou'd</HI> be &s;een,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"you mu&s;t account for your appear|ance &s;o as not to di&s;cover me. Your own pre&s;ence of mind may a&s;&s;i&s;t you, I cannot.&mdash;God ble&s;s you!"</Q></P>
<P>When &s;he was gone, Madame La Motte's admiration of her conduct began to yield to other emotions. Di&s;tru&s;t gradually undermined kindne&s;s, and jealou&s;y rai&s;ed &s;u&s;picions. <Q REND="inline">"It mu&s;t be a &s;entiment more powerful than gratitude,"</Q> thought &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"that could teach Adeline to &s;ubdue her fears. What, but
<PB N="106" REF="108">
Love, could influence her to a conduct &s;o generous!"</Q> Madame La Motte, when &s;he found it impo&s;&s;ible to account for Adeline's con|duct, without alledging &s;ome intere&s;ted motives for it, however her &s;u&s;picions might agree with the practice of the world, had &s;urely forgotten how much &s;he once admired the purity and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of her young friend.</P>
<P>Adeline, mean while, a&s;cended the cham|bers: the cheerful beams of the &s;un played once more upon her &s;ight, and re-animated her &s;pirits; &s;he walked lightly through the apart|ments, nor &s;topped till &s;he came to the &s;tairs of the tower. Here &s;he &s;tood for &s;ome time, but no &s;ounds met her ear, &s;ave the &s;ighing of the wind among the trees, and, at length, &s;he de|&s;cended. She pa&s;&s;ed the apartments below, with|out &s;eeing any per&s;on; and the little furniture that remained, &s;eemed to &s;tand exactly as &s;he had left it. She now ventured to look out from the tower: the only animate objects, that ap|peared, were the deer, quietly grazing under the &s;hade of the woods. Her favourite little fawn di&s;tingui&s;hed Adeline, and came bounding to|wards her with &s;trong marks of joy. She was &s;omewhat alarmed le&s;t the animal, being ob&s;er|ved, &s;hould betray her, and walked &s;wiftly away through the cloi&s;ters.</P>
<P>She opened the door that led to the great hall of the abbey, but the pa&s;&s;age was &s;o gloomy and dark, that &s;he feared to enter it, and &s;tarted
<PB N="107" REF="109">
back. It was nece&s;&s;ary, however, that &s;he &s;hould examine farther, particularly on the op|po&s;ite &s;ide of the ruin, of which &s;he had hitherto had no view: but her fears returned when &s;he recollected how far it would lead her from her only place of refuge, and how difficult it would be to retreat. She he&s;itated what to do; but when &s;he recollected her obligations to La Motte, and con&s;idered this as, perhaps, her only oppor|tunity of doing him a &s;ervice, &s;he determined to proceed.</P>
<P>As the&s;e thoughts pa&s;&s;ed rapidly over her mind, &s;he rai&s;ed her innocent looks to heaven, and breathed a &s;ilent prayer. With trembling &s;teps &s;he proceeded over fragments of the ruin, looking anxiou&s;ly around, and often &s;tarting as the breeze ru&s;tled among the trees, mi&s;taking it for the whi&s;perings of men. She came to the lawn which fronted the fabric, but no per&s;on was to be &s;een, and her &s;pirits revived. The great door of the hall &s;he now endeavoured to open, but &s;uddenly remembering that it was fa&s;tened by La Motte's orders, &s;he proceeded to the north end of the abbey, and having &s;urveyed the pro&s;pect around, as far as the thick foliage of the trees would permit, without perceiving any per&s;on, &s;he turned her &s;teps to the tower from which &s;he had i&s;&s;ued.</P>
<P>Adeline was now light of heart, and returned with impatience to inform La Motte of his &s;ecu|rity. In the cloi&s;ters &s;he was again met by her
<PB N="77" REF="110">
little favourite, and &s;topped for a moment to ca|re&s;s it. The fawn &s;eemed &s;en&s;ible to the &s;ound of her voice, and di&s;covered new joy; but while &s;he &s;poke, it &s;uddenly &s;tarted from her hand, and looking up &s;he perceived the door of the pa&s;&s;age, leading to the great hall, open, and a man in the habit of a &s;oldier i&s;&s;ue forth.</P>
<P>With the &s;wiftne&s;s of an arrow &s;he fled along the cloi&s;ters, nor once ventured to look back; but a voice called to her to &s;top, and &s;he heard &s;teps advancing quick in pur&s;uit. Before &s;he could reach the tower, her breath failed her, and &s;he leaned again&s;t a pillar of the ruin, pale and exhau&s;ted. The man came up, and gazing at her with a &s;trong expre&s;&s;ion of &s;urprize and curio&s;ity, he a&s;&s;umed a gentle manner, a&s;&s;ured her &s;he had nothing to fear, and inquired if &s;he belonged to La Motte: ob&s;erving that &s;he &s;till looked terrified and remained &s;ilent, he re|peated his a&s;&s;urances and his que&s;tion.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I know that he is concealed within the ruin,"</Q> &s;aid the &s;tranger; <Q REND="inline">"the occa&s;ion of his concealment I al&s;o know; but it is of the utmo&s;t importance I &s;hould &s;ee him, and he will then be convinced he has nothing to fear from me."</Q> Adeline trembled &s;o exce&s;&s;ively, that it was with difficulty &s;he could &s;upport her|&s;elf&mdash;&s;he he&s;itated, and knew not what to reply. Her manner &s;eemed to confirm the &s;u&s;picions of the &s;tranger, and her con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of this in|crea&s;ed her embara&s;&s;ment: he took advantage of
<PB N="109" REF="111">
to pre&s;s her farther. Adeline, at length, re|plied, that <Q REND="inline">"La Motte had &s;ome time &s;ince re|&s;ided at the abbey."</Q> <Q REND="inline"> "And does &s;till, Ma|dam,"</Q> &s;aid the &s;tranger; <Q REND="inline">"lead me to where he may be found&mdash;I mu&s;t &s;ee him, and"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Never, Sir,"</Q> replied Adeline, <Q REND="inline">"and I &s;o|lemnly a&s;&s;ure you, it will be in vain to &s;earch for him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That I mu&s;t try,"</Q> re&s;umed he, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ince you, Madam, will not a&s;&s;i&s;t me. I have already followed him to &s;ome chambers above, where I &s;uddenly lo&s;t him: thereabouts he mu&s;t be concealed, and it's plain, therefore, they af|ford &s;ome &s;ecret pa&s;&s;age."</Q></P>
<P>Without waiting Adeline's reply, he &s;prung to the door of the tower. She now thought it would betray a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the truth of his conjecture to follow him, and re&s;olved to re|main below. But upon farther con&s;ideration, it occurred to her, that he might &s;teal &s;ilently into the clo&s;et, and po&s;&s;ibly &s;urprize La Motte at the door of the trap. She, therefore, ha&s;tened after him, that her voice might prevent the danger &s;he apprehended. He was already in the &s;econd chamber, when &s;he overtook him; &s;he immedi|ately began to &s;peak aloud.</P>
<P>This room he &s;earched with the mo&s;t &s;cru|pulous care, but finding no private door, or other outlet, he proceeded to the clo&s;et; then it was, that it required all her fortitude to con|ceal her agitation. He continued the &s;earch.
<PB N="110" REF="112">
<Q REND="inline">"Within the&s;e chambers, I know he is con|cealed,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"though hitherto I have not been able to di&s;cover how. It was hither I followed a man, whom I believe to be him, and he could not e&s;cape without a pa&s;&s;age; I &s;hall not quit the place till I have found it."</Q></P>
<P>He examined the walls and the boards, but without di&s;covering the divi&s;ion of the floor, which, indeed, &s;o exactly corre&s;ponded, that La Motte him&s;elf had not perceived by the eye, but by the trembling of the floor beneath his feet. <Q REND="inline">"Here is &s;ome my&s;tery,"</Q> &s;aid the &s;tranger, <Q REND="inline">"which I cannot comprehend, and perhaps never &s;hall."</Q> He was turning to quit the clo&s;et, when, who can paint the di&s;tre&s;s of Ade|line, upon &s;eeing the trap-door gently rai&s;ed, and La Motte him&s;elf appeared. <Q REND="inline">"Hah!"</Q> cried the &s;tranger, advancing eagerly to him. La Motte &s;prang forward, and they were locked in each other's arms.</P>
<P>The a&s;toni&s;hment of Adeline, for a moment, &s;urpa&s;&s;ed even her former di&s;tre&s;s; but a remem|brance darted acro&s;s her mind, which explained the pre&s;ent &s;cene, and before La Motte could exclaim, <Q REND="inline">"My &s;on!"</Q> &s;he knew the &s;tranger as &s;uch. Peter, who &s;tood at the foot of the &s;tairs and heard what pa&s;&s;ed above, flew to acquaint his mi&s;tre&s;s with the joyful di&s;covery, and, in a few moments, &s;he was folded in the embrace of her &s;on. This &s;pot &s;o lately the man&s;ion of de&s;pair, &s;eemed metamorpho&s;ed into the palace
<PB N="111" REF="113">
plea&s;ure, and the walls echoed only to the ac|cents of joy and congratulation.</P>
<P>The joy of Peter on this occa&s;ion was beyond expre&s;&s;ion: he acted a perfect pantomime&mdash;he capered about, cla&s;ped his hands&mdash;ran to his young ma&s;ter&mdash;&s;hook him by the hand, in &s;pite of the frowns of La Motte; ran every where, without knowing for what, and gave no rational an&s;wer to any thing that was &s;aid to him.</P>
<P>After their fir&s;t emotions were &s;ub&s;ided, La Motte, as if &s;uddenly recollecting him&s;elf re|&s;umed his wonted &s;olemnity: <Q REND="inline">"I am to blame,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"thus to give way to joy, when I am &s;till, perhaps, &s;urrounded by danger. Let us &s;ecure a retreat while it is yet in our power,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline">"in a few hours the King's of|ficers may &s;earch for me again."</Q></P>
<P>Louis comprehended his father's words, and immediately relieved his apprehen&s;ions by the following relation:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A letter from Mon&s;ieur Nemours, contain|ing an account of your flight from Paris, reached me at Peronne, where I was then upon duty with my regiment. He men|tioned, that you was gone towards the &s;outh of France, but as he had not &s;ince heard from you, he was ignorant of the place of your refuge. It was about this time that I was di&s;patched into Flanders; and, being unable to obtain farther intelligence of you, I pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome weeks of very painful &s;olicitude. At the conclu&s;ion of the campaign, I obtained
<PB N="112" REF="114">
leave of ab&s;ence, and immediately &s;et out for Paris, hoping to learn from Nemours, where you had found an a&s;ylum.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Of this, however, he was equally ignorant with my&s;elf. He informed me that you had once before written to him from D&mdash;, upon your &s;econd day's journey from Paris, under an a&s;&s;umed name, as had been agreed upon; and that you then &s;aid the fear of di&s;|covery would prevent your hazarding another letter. He, therefore, remained ignorant of your abode, but &s;aid he had no doubt you had continued your journey to the &s;outhward. Upon this &s;lender information I quitted Paris in &s;earch of you, and proceeded immediately to V&mdash;, where my inquiries, concerning your father's progre&s;s, were &s;ucce&s;sful as far as M&mdash;. There they told me you had &s;taid &s;ome time, on account of the illne&s;s of a young lady; a circum&s;tance which perplexed me much, as I could not imagine what young lady would accompany you. I proceeded, however, to L&mdash;; but there all traces of you &s;eemed to be lo&s;t. As I &s;at mu&s;ing at the window of the inn, I ob&s;erved &s;ome &s;cribbling on the gla&s;s, and the curio&s;ity of idlene&s;s prompted me to read it. I thought I knew the characters, and the lines I read confirmed my conjecture, for I remembered to have heard you often repeat them.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="115"><Q REND="inline">"Here I renewed my inquiries concerning your route, and at length I made the people of the inn recollect you, and traced you as far as Auboine. There I again lo&s;t you, till upon my return from a fruitle&s;s inquiry in the neighbourhood, the landlord of the little inn where I lodged, told me he believed he had heard news of you, and immediately re|counted what had happened at a black&s;mith's &s;hop a few hours before.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"His de&s;cription of Peter was &s;o exact, that I had not a doubt it was you who inhabited the abbey; and, as I knew your nece&s;&s;ity for concealment, Peter's denial did not &s;hake my confidence. The next morning, with the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of my landlord, I found my way hi|ther, and, having &s;earched every vi&s;ible part of the fabric, I began to credit Peter's a&s;&s;er|tion: your appearance, however, de&s;troyed this fear, by proving that the place was &s;till inhabited, for you di&s;appeared &s;o in&s;tantane|ou&s;ly, that I was not certain it was you whom I had &s;een. I continued &s;eeking you till near the clo&s;e of day, and till then &s;carcely quitted the chambers whence you had di&s;appeared. I called on you repeatedly, believing that my voice might convince you of your mi&s;take. At length, I retired to pa&s;s the night at a cot|tage near the border of the fore&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I came early this morning to renew my in|quiries, and hoped that, believing your&s;elf
<PB N="114" REF="116">
&s;afe, you would emerge from concealment. But how was I di&s;appointed to find the abbey as &s;ilent and &s;olitary as I had left it the prece|ding evening! I was returning once more from the great hall, when the voice of this young lady caught my ear, and effected the di&s;covery I had &s;o anxiou&s;ly &s;ought."</Q></P>
<P>This little narrative entirely di&s;&s;ipated the late apprehen&s;ions of La Motte; but he now dreaded that the inquiries of his &s;on, and his own obvi|ous de&s;ire of concealment, might excite a curi|o&s;ity among&s;t the people of Auboine, and lead to a di&s;covery of his true circum&s;tances. However, for the pre&s;ent he determined to di&s;mi&s;s all pain|ful thoughts, and endeavour to enjoy the com|fort which the pre&s;ence of his &s;on had brought him. The furniture was removed to a more habitable part of the abbey, and the cells were again abandoned to their own glooms.</P>
<P>The arrival of her &s;on &s;eemed to have ani|mated Madame La Motte with new life, and all her afflictions were, for the pre&s;ent, ab&s;orbed in joy. She often gazed &s;ilently on him with a mother's fondne&s;s, and her partiality heightened every improvement which time had wrought in his per&s;on and manner. He was now in his twenty-third year; his per&s;on was manly and his air military; his manners were unaffected and graceful, rather than dignified; and though his features were irregular, they compo&s;ed a
<PB N="115" REF="117">
countenance, which, having &s;een it once, you would &s;eek it again.</P>
<P>She made eager inquiries after the friends &s;he had left at Paris, and learned, that within the few months of her ab&s;ence, &s;ome had died and others quitted the place. La Motte al&s;o learned, that a very &s;trenuous &s;earch for him had been pro&s;ecuted at Paris; and, though this intelligence was only what he had before expected, it &s;hocked him &s;o much, that he now declared it would be expedient to remove to a di&s;tant country. Louis did not &s;cruple to &s;ay, that he thought he would be as &s;afe at the abbey as at any other place; and repeated what Nemours had &s;aid, that the King's officers had been unable to trace any part of his route from Paris.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Be&s;ides,"</Q> re&s;umed Louis, <Q REND="inline">"this abbey is protected by a &s;upernatural power, and none of the country people dare approach it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Plea&s;e you, my young ma&s;ter,"</Q> &s;aid Peter, who was waiting in the room, <Q REND="inline">"we were frightened enough the fir&s;t night we came here, and I, my&s;elf, God forgive me! thought the place was inhabited by devils, but they were only owls, and &s;uch like, af|ter all."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your opinion was not a&s;ked,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"learn to be &s;ilent."</Q></P>
<P>Peter was aba&s;hed. When he had quitted the room, La Motte a&s;ked his &s;on with &s;eeming
<PB N="116" REF="118">
carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, what were the reports circulated by the country people? <Q REND="inline">"O! Sir,"</Q> replied Louis, <Q REND="inline">"I cannot recollect half of them. I remember, however, they &s;aid, that, many years ago, a per&s;on (but nobody had ever &s;een him, &s;o we may judge how far the report ought to be credited) a per&s;on was privately brought to this abbey, and confined in &s;ome part of it, and that there were &s;trong rea&s;ons to believe he came unfairly to his end."</Q></P>
<P>La Motte &s;ighed. <Q REND="inline">"They farther &s;aid,"</Q> continued Louis, <Q REND="inline">"that the &s;pectre of the de|cea&s;ed had ever &s;ince watched nightly among the ruins: and to make the &s;tory more won|derful, for the marvellous is the delight of the vulgar, they added, that there was a certain part of the ruin, from whence no per&s;on that had dared to explore it, had ever returned. Thus people, who have few objects of real intere&s;t to engage their thoughts, conjure up for them&s;elves imaginary ones."</Q></P>
<P>La Motte &s;at mu&s;ing. <Q REND="inline">"And what were the rea&s;ons,"</Q> &s;aid he, at length awaking from his reverie, <Q REND="inline">"they pretended to a&s;&s;ign, for be|lieving the per&s;on confined here was mur|dered?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"They did not u&s;e a term &s;o po&s;itive as that,"</Q> replied Louis.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"True,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte, recollecting him|&s;elf, <Q REND="inline">"they only &s;aid he came unfairly to his end."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="119">
<Q REND="inline">"That is a nice di&s;tinction,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why I could not well comprehend what the&s;e rea&s;ons were,"</Q> re&s;umed Louis, <Q REND="inline">"the people indeed &s;ay, that the per&s;on, who was brought here, was never known to depart, but I do not find it certain that he ever arri|ved; that there was &s;trange privacy and my&s;|tery ob&s;erved while he was here, and that the abbey has never &s;ince been inhabited by its owner. There &s;eems, however, to be no|thing in all this that de&s;erves to be remem|bered."</Q> La Motte rai&s;ed his head, as if to reply, when the entrance of Madame turned the di&s;cour&s;e upon a new &s;ubject, and it was not re|&s;umed that day.</P>
<P>Peter was now di&s;patched for provi&s;ions, while La Motte and Louis retired to con&s;ider how far it was &s;afe for them to continue at the abbey. La Motte, notwith&s;tanding the a&s;&s;urances lately given him, could not but think that Peter's blun|ders and his &s;on's inquiries might lead to a di&s;|covery of his re&s;idence. He revolved this in his mind for &s;ome time, but at length a thought &s;truck him, that the latter of the&s;e circum&s;tan|ces might con&s;iderably contribute to his &s;ecurity. <Q REND="inline">"If you,"</Q> &s;aid he to Louis, <Q REND="inline">"return to the inn at Auboine, from whence you were directed here, and without &s;eeming to intend giving intelligence, <HI>do</HI> give the landlord an account of your having found the abbey uninhabited, and then add, that you had di&s;covered the re|&s;idence
<PB N="118" REF="120">
of the per&s;on you &s;ought in &s;ome di&s;|tant town, it would &s;uppre&s;s any reports that may at pre&s;ent exi&s;t, and prevent the belief of any in future. And if, after all this, you can tru&s;t your&s;elf for pre&s;ence of mind and com|mand of countenance, &s;o far as to de&s;cribe &s;ome dreadful apparition, I think the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, together with the di&s;tance of the Abbey, and the intricacies of the fore&s;t, could intitle me to con&s;ider this place as my ca&s;tle."</Q></P>
<P>Louis agreed to all that his father had propo|&s;ed, and on the following day executed his com|mi&s;&s;ion with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that the tranquility of the abbey may be then &s;aid to have been en|tirely re&s;tored:</P>
<P>Thus ended this adventure, the only one that had occurred to di&s;turb the family, during their re&s;idence in the fore&s;t. Adeline, removed from the apprehen&s;ion of tho&s;e evils, with which the late &s;ituation of La Motte had threatened her, and from the depre&s;&s;ion which her intere&s;t in his occa&s;ioned her, now experienced a more than u&s;ual complacency of mind. She thought too that &s;he ob&s;erved in Madame La Motte a renewal of her former kindne&s;s, and this circum|&s;tance awakened all her gratitude, and imparted to her a plea&s;ure as lively as it was innocent. The &s;atisfaction with which the pre&s;ence of her &s;on in&s;pired Madame La Motte, Adeline mi&s;|took for kindne&s;s to her&s;elf, and &s;he exerted her
<PB N="119" REF="121">
whole attention in an endeavour to become wor|thy of it.</P>
<P>But the joy which his unexpected arrival had given to La Motte quickly began to evaporate, and the gloom of de&s;pondency again &s;ettled on his countenance. He returned frequently to his haunt in the fore&s;t&mdash;the &s;ame my&s;terious &s;adne&s;s tinctured his manner and revived the anxiety of Madame La Motte, who was re&s;olved to ac|quaint her &s;on with this &s;ubject of di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;olicit his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to penetrate its &s;ource.</P>
<P>Her jealou&s;y of Adeline, however, &s;he could not communicate, though it again tormented her, and taught her to mi&s;con&s;true with wonder|ful ingenuity every look and word of La Motte, and often to mi&s;take the artle&s;s expre&s;&s;ions of Adeline's gratitude and regard for tho&s;e of warmer tenderne&s;s. Adeline had formerly ac|cu&s;tomed her&s;elf to long walks in the fore&s;t, and the de&s;ign Madame had formed of watching her &s;teps, had been fru&s;trated by the late cir|cum&s;tances, and was now entirely overcome by her &s;en&s;e of its difficulty and danger. To em|ploy Peter in the affair, would be to acquaint him with her fears, and to follow her her&s;elf, would mo&s;t probably betray her &s;cheme, by making Adeline aware of her jealou&s;y. Being thus re&s;trained by pride and delicacy, &s;he was obliged to endure the pangs of uncertainty con|cerning the greate&s;t part of her &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="122">
To Louis, however &s;he related the my&s;terious change in his father's temper. He li&s;tened to her account with very earne&s;t attention, and the &s;urprize and concern impre&s;&s;ed upon his countenance &s;poke how much his heart was in|tere&s;ted. He was, however involved in equal perplexity with her&s;elf upon this &s;ubject, and readily undertook to ob&s;erve the motions of La Motte, believing his interference likely to be of equal &s;ervice both to his father and his mother. He &s;aw in &s;ome degree, the &s;u&s;picions of his mother, but as he thought &s;he wi&s;hed to di&s;gui&s;e her feelings, he &s;uffered her to believe that &s;he &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>He now inquired concerning Adeline, and li&s;tened to her little hi&s;tory, of which his mo|ther gave a brief relation, with great apparent intere&s;t. So much pity did he expre&s;s for her condition, and &s;o much indignation at the un|natural conduct of her father, that the appre|hen&s;ions which Madame La Motte began to form, of his having di&s;covered her jealou&s;y, yielded to tho&s;e of a different kind. She per|ceived that the beauty of Adeline had already fa&s;ci|nated his imagination, and &s;he feared that her amiable manners would &s;oon impre&s;s his heart. Had her fir&s;t fondne&s;s for Adeline continued, &s;he would &s;till have looked with di&s;plea&s;ure upon their attachment, as an ob&s;tacle to the pro|motion and the fortune &s;he hoped to &s;ee one day enjoyed by her &s;on. On the&s;e &s;he re&s;ted all
<PB N="121" REF="123">
her future hopes of pro&s;perity, and regarded the matrimonial alliance which he might form as the only means of extricating his family from their pre&s;ent difficulties. She, therefore, touched lightly upon Adeline's merit, joined coolly with Louis in compa&s;&s;ionating her misfortunes, and with her cen&s;ure of the father's conduct, mixed an implied &s;u&s;picion of that of Adeline's The means &s;he employed to repre&s;s the pa&s;&s;ions of her &s;on, had a contrary effect. The indif|ference, which &s;he repre&s;&s;ed towards Adeline, increa&s;ed his pity for her de&s;titute condition, and the tenderne&s;s, with which &s;he affected to judge the father, heightened his hone&s;t indigna|tion at his character.</P>
<P>As he quitted Madame La Motte, he &s;aw his father cro&s;s the lawn and enter the deep &s;hade of the fore&s;t on the left. He judged this to be a good opportunity of commencing his plan, and, quitting the abbey, &s;lowly followed at a di&s;|tance. La Motte continued to walk &s;traight for|ward, and &s;eemed &s;o deeply wrapt in thought, that he looked neither to the right or left, and &s;carcely lifted his head from the ground. Louis had followed him near half a mile, when he &s;aw him &s;uddenly &s;trike into an avenue of the fore&s;t, which took a different direction from the way he had hitherto gone. He quickened his &s;teps that he might not lo&s;e &s;ight of him, but, having reached the avenue, found the trees &s;o
<PB N="122" REF="124">
thickly interwoven, that La Motte was already hid from his view.</P>
<P>He continued, however, to pur&s;ue the way before him: it conducted him through the mo&s;t gloomy part of the fore&s;t he had yet &s;een, till at length it terminated in an ob&s;cure rece&s;s, over|arched with high trees, who&s;e interwoven branches &s;ecluded the direct rays of the &s;un, and admitted only a &s;ort of &s;olemn twilight. Louis looked around in &s;earch of La Motte, but he was no where to be &s;een. While he &s;tood &s;urveying the place, and con&s;idering what far|ther &s;hould be done, he ob&s;erved, through the gloom, an object at &s;ome di&s;tance, but the deep &s;hadow that fell around prevented his di&s;tin|gui&s;hing what it was.</P>
<P>In advancing, he perceived the ruins of a &s;mall building, which, from the traces that remained, appeared to have been a tomb. As he gazed upon it, <Q REND="inline">"Here,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"are probably depo&s;ited the a&s;hes of &s;ome ancient monk, once an inhabitant of the abbey; per|haps, of the founder, who, after having &s;pent a life of ab&s;tinence and prayer, &s;ought in heaven the reward of his forbearance upon earth. Peace be to his &s;oul! but did he think a life of mere negative virtue de&s;erved an eternal reward? Mi&s;taken man! rea&s;on, had you tru&s;ted to its dictates, would have in|formed you, that the active virtues, the ad|herence to the golden rule, "Do as you
<PB N="123" REF="125">
would be done unto,' could alone de&s;erve the favour of a Deity, who&s;e glory is bene|volence."</Q></P>
<P>He remained with his eyes fixed upon the &s;pot, and pre&s;ently &s;aw a figure ari&s;e under the arch of the &s;epulchre. It &s;tarted, as if on per|ceiving him, and immediately di&s;appeared. Louis, though unu&s;ed to fear, felt at that mo|ment an unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation, but almo&s;t it imme|diately &s;truck him that this was La Motte him|&s;elf. He advanced to the ruin and called him. No an&s;wer was returned, and he repeated the call, but all was yet &s;till as the grave. He then went up to the arch-way and endeavoured to examine the place where he had di&s;appeared, but the &s;hadowy ob&s;curity rendered the attempt fruitle&s;s. He ob&s;erved, however, a little to the right, an entrance to the ruin, and advanced &s;ome &s;teps down a dark kind of pa&s;&s;age, when, recollecting that this place might be the haunt of banditti, his danger alarmed him, and he retreated with precipitation.</P>
<P>He walked toward the abbey by the way he came, and finding no per&s;on followed him, and believing him&s;elf again in &s;afety, his former &s;urmi&s;e returned, and he thought it was La Motte he had &s;een. He mu&s;ed upon this &s;trange po&s;&s;ibility, and endeavoured to a&s;&s;ign a rea&s;on for &s;o my&s;terious a conduct, but in vain. Not|with&s;tanding this, his belief of it &s;trengthened, and he entered the abbey under as full a con|viction
<PB N="124" REF="126">
as the circum&s;tances would admit of, that it was his father who had appeared in the &s;epulchre. On entering what was now u&s;ed as a parlour, he was much &s;urpri&s;ed to find him quietly &s;eated there with Madame La Motte and Adeline, and conver&s;ing as if he had been returned &s;ome time.</P>
<P>He took the fir&s;t opportunity of acquaincing his mother with his late adventure, and of in|quiring how long La Motte had been returned before him, when, learning that it was near half an hour, his &s;urpri&s;e increa&s;ed, and he knew not what to conclude.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, a perception of the growing partiality of Louis co-operated with the canker of &s;u&s;picion, to de&s;troy in Madame La Motte that affection which pity and e&s;teem had for|merly excited for Adeline. Her unkindne&s;s was now too obvious to e&s;cape the notice of her to whom it was directed, and, being noticed, it occa&s;ioned an angui&s;h which Adeline found it very difficult to endure. With the warmth and candour of youth, &s;he &s;ought an explanation of this change of behaviour, and an opportunity of exculpating her&s;elf from any intention of provoking it. But this Madame La Motte artfully evaded, while at the &s;ame time &s;he threw out hints, that involved Adeline in deeper perplexity, and &s;erved to make her pre&s;ent affliction more intolerable.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="127">
<Q REND="inline">"I have lo&s;t that affection,"</Q> &s;he would &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"which was my all. It was my only comfort&mdash;yet I have lo&s;t it&mdash;and this without even knowing my offence. But I am thankful I have not merited unkindne&s;s, and, though <HI>&s;he</HI> has abandoned <HI>me,</HI> I &s;hall always love <HI>her.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Thus di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, &s;he would frequently leave the parlour, and, retiring to her chamber, would yield to a de&s;pondency, which &s;he had never known till now.</P>
<P>One morning, being unable to &s;leep, &s;he aro&s;e at a very early hour. The faint light of day now trembled through the clouds, and, gra|dually &s;preading from the horizon, announced the ri&s;ing &s;un. Every feature of the land&s;cape was &s;lowly unveiled, moi&s;t with the dews of night, and brightening with the dawn, till at length the &s;un appeared and &s;hed the full flood of day. The beauty of the hour invited her to walk, and &s;he went forth into the fore&s;t to ta&s;te the &s;weets of morning. The carols of new|waked birds &s;aluted her as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed, and the fre&s;h gale came &s;cented with the breath of flow|ers, who&s;e tints glowed more vivid through the dew drops that hung on their leaves.</P>
<P>She wandered on without noticing the di&s;|tance, and, following the windings of the river, came to a dewy glade, who&s;e woods, &s;weeping down to the very edge of the water, formed a &s;cene &s;o &s;weetly romantic, that &s;he &s;eated her|&s;elf
<PB N="126" REF="128">
at the foot of a tree, to contemplate its beauty. The&s;e images in&s;en&s;ibly &s;oothed her &s;orrow, and in&s;pired her with that &s;oft and plea&s;ing melancholy, &s;o dear to the feeling mind. For &s;ome time &s;he &s;at lo&s;t in a reverie, while the flowers that grew on the banks be&s;ide her &s;eemed to &s;mile in new life, and drew from her a compari&s;on with her own condition. She mu&s;ed and &s;ighed, and then, in a voice, who&s;e charming melody was modulated by the tender|ne&s;s of her heart, &s;he &s;ung the following words:
<Q><LG TYPE="sonnet">

</LG></Q></P>
<P>A di&s;tant echo lengthened out her tones, and &s;he &s;at li&s;tening to the &s;oft re&s;pon&s;e, till re|peating the la&s;t &s;tanza of the Sonnet, &s;he was an&s;wered by a voice almo&s;t as tender, and le&s;s di&s;tant. She looked round in &s;urpri&s;e, and &s;aw a young man in a hunter's dre&s;s, leaning again&s;t a tree, and gazing on her with that deep atten|tion, which marks an enraptured mind.</P>
<P>A thou&s;and apprehen&s;ions &s;hot athwart her bu&s;y thought; and &s;he now fir&s;t remembered her di&s;tance from the abbey. She ro&s;e in ha&s;te to be gone, when the &s;tranger re&s;pectfully ad|vanced; but, ob&s;erving her timid looks and re|tiring &s;teps, he pau&s;ed. She pur&s;ued her way towards the abbey; and, though many rea&s;ons made her anxious to know whether &s;he was followed, delicacy forbade her to look back. When &s;he reached the abbey, finding the family was not yet a&s;&s;embled to breakfa&s;t, &s;he retired to her chamber, where her whole thoughts were employed in conjectures concerning the &s;tranger;

believing that &s;he was intere&s;ted on this point, no farther than as it concerned the &s;afety of La Motte, &s;he indulged, without &s;cruple, the re|membrance of that dignified air and manner which &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed the youth &s;he had &s;een. After revolving the circum&s;tance more deeply, &s;he believed it impo&s;&s;ible that a per&s;on of his appearance &s;hould be engaged in a &s;tra|tagem to betray a fellow-creature; and though &s;he was de&s;titute of a &s;ingle circum&s;tance that might a&s;&s;i&s;t her &s;urmi&s;es of who he was, or what was his bu&s;ine&s;s in an unfrequented fore&s;t, &s;he rejected, uncon&s;ciou&s;ly, every &s;u&s;picion inju|rious to his character. Upon farther deliberation, therefore, &s;he re&s;olved not to mention this little circum&s;tance to La Motte; well knowing, that though his danger might be imaginary, his ap|prehen&s;ions would be real, and would renew all the &s;ufferings and perplexity, from which he was but ju&s;t relea&s;ed. She re&s;olved, however, to refrain, for &s;ome time, walking in the fore&s;t.</P>
<P>When &s;he came down to breakfa&s;t, &s;he ob|&s;erved Madame La Motte to be more than u&s;ually re&s;erved. La Motte entered the room &s;oon after her, and made &s;ome trifling ob&s;erva|tions on the weather; and, having endeavoured to &s;upport an effort at cheerfulne&s;s, &s;unk into his u&s;ual melancholy. Adeline watched the countenance of Madame with anxiety; and when there appeared in it a gleam of kindne&s;s, it was as &s;un&s;hine to her &s;oul: but &s;he very &s;eldom &s;uf|fered
<PB N="129" REF="131">
Adeline thus to flatter her&s;elf. Her con|ver&s;ation was re&s;trained, and often pointed at &s;omething more than could be under&s;tood. The entrance of Louis was a very &s;ea&s;onable relief to Adeline, who almo&s;t feared to tru&s;t her voice with a &s;entence, le&s;t its trembling accents &s;hould betray her unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This charming morning drew you early from your chamber,"</Q> &s;aid Louis, addre&s;&s;ing Adeline. <Q REND="inline">"You had, no doubt, a plea&s;ant companion too,"</Q> &s;aid Madame La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"a &s;olitary walk is &s;eldom agreeable."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I was alone, Madam,"</Q> replied Adeline.</P>
<Q REND="inline">"Indeed! your own thoughts mu&s;t be highly plea&s;ing then."</Q>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Alas!"</Q> returned Adeline, a tear, &s;pite of her efforts, &s;tarting to her eye, <Q REND="inline">"there are now few &s;ubjects of plea&s;ure left for them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That is very &s;urprizing,"</Q> pur&s;ued Madame La Motte.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is it, indeed, &s;urprizing, Madam, for tho&s;e who have lo&s;t their la&s;t friend to be unhappy?"</Q></P>
<P>Madame La Motte's con&s;cience acknowledged the rebuke, and &s;he blu&s;hed. <Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> re|&s;umed &s;he, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"that is not your &s;ituation, Adeline;"</Q> looking earne&s;tly at La Motte. Adeline, who&s;e innocence pro|tected her from &s;u&s;picion, did not regard this circum&s;tance; but, &s;miling through her tears, &s;aid, &s;he rejoiced to hear her &s;ay &s;o. During
<PB N="130" REF="132">
this conver&s;ation, La Motte had remained ab|&s;orbed in his own thoughts; and Louis, unable to gue&s;s at what it pointed, looked alternately at his mother and Adeline for an explanation. The latter he regarded with an expre&s;&s;ion &s;o full of tender compa&s;&s;ion, that it revealed at once to Madame La Motte the &s;entiments of his &s;oul; and &s;he immediately replied to the la&s;t words of Adeline with a very &s;erious air; <Q REND="inline">"A friend is only e&s;timable when our conduct de&s;erves one; the friend&s;hip that &s;urvives the merit of its object, is a di&s;grace, in&s;tead of an honour, to both parties."</Q></P>
<P>The manner and empha&s;is with which &s;he delivered the&s;e words, again alarmed Adeline, who mildly &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"&s;he hoped &s;he &s;hould never de&s;erve &s;uch cen&s;ure."</Q> Madame was &s;ilent; but Adeline was &s;o much &s;hocked by what had already pa&s;&s;ed, that tears &s;prung from her eyes, and &s;he hid her face with her handkerchief.</P>
<P>Louis now ro&s;e with &s;ome emotion; and La Motte, rou&s;ed from his reverie, inquired what was the matter; but, before he could receive an an&s;wer, he &s;eemed to have forgot that he had a&s;ked the que&s;tion. <Q REND="inline">"Adeline may give you her own account,"</Q> &s;aid Madame La Motte. <Q REND="inline">"I have not de&s;erved this,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline, ri&s;ing, <Q REND="inline">"but &s;ince my pre&s;ence is di&s;plea&s;ing, I will retire."</Q></P>
<P>She moved toward the door, when Louis, who was pacing the room in apparent agitation,
<PB N="131" REF="133">
gently took her hand, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Here is &s;ome unhappy mi&s;take,"</Q> and would have led her to the &s;eat; but her &s;pirits were too much de|pre&s;&s;ed to endure longer re&s;traint; and, with|drawing her hand, <Q REND="inline">"Suffer me to go;"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"if there is any mi&s;take, I am unable to explain it."</Q> Saying this, &s;he quitted the room. Louis followed her with his eyes to the door; when, turning to his mother, <Q REND="inline">"Surely, Ma|dam,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"you are to blame; my life on it, &s;he de&s;erves your warme&s;t tenderne&s;s."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are very eloquent in her cau&s;e, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Madame, <Q REND="inline">"may I pre&s;ume to a&s;k what has intere&s;ted you thus in her favour?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Her own amiable manners,"</Q> rejoined Louis, <Q REND="inline">"which no one can ob&s;erve without e&s;teeming them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But you may pre&s;ume too much on your own ob&s;ervations; it is po&s;&s;ible the&s;e amiable manners may deceive you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your pardon, Madam; I may, with|out pre&s;umption, affirm they cannot deceive me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You have, no doubt, good rea&s;ons for this a&s;&s;ertion, and I perceive, by your admi|ration of this artle&s;s <HI>innocent,</HI> &s;he has &s;uc|ceeded in her de&s;ign of entrapping your heart."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Without de&s;igning it, &s;he has won my ad|miration, which would not have been the ca&s;e, had &s;he been capable of the conduct you mention."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="134">
Madame La Motte was going to reply, but was prevented by her hu&s;band, who, again rou&s;ed from his reverie, inquired into the cau&s;e of di&s;pute; <Q REND="inline">"Away with this ridiculous beha|viour,"</Q> &s;aid he, in a voice of di&s;plea&s;ure. <Q REND="inline">"Adeline has omitted &s;ome hou&s;ehold duty I &s;uppo&s;e, and an offence &s;o heinous de&s;erves &s;evere puni&s;hment, no doubt; but let me be no more di&s;turbed with your petty quarrels; if you mu&s;t be tyrannical, Madam, indulge your humour in private."</Q></P>
<P>Saying this, he abruptly quitted the room, and Louis immediately following, Madame was left to her own unplea&s;ant reflections. Her ill|humour proceeded from the u&s;ual cau&s;e. She had heard of Adeline's walk; and La Motte having gone forth into the fore&s;t at an early hour, her imagination, heated by the broodings of jealou&s;y, &s;ugge&s;ted that they had appointed a meeting. This was confirmed to her by the entrance of Adeline, quickly followed by La Motte; and her perceptions thus jaundiced by pa&s;&s;ion, neither the pre&s;ence of her &s;on, nor her u&s;ual attention to good manners, had been able to re&s;train her emotions. The behaviour of Adeline, in the late &s;cene, &s;he con&s;idered as a refined piece of art; and the indifference of La Motte as affected. So true is it, that 
<Q><L>&mdash;"Trifles, light as air,</L>
<L>Are, to the jealous, confirmations &s;trong</L>
<L>As <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> Holy Writ,"</L></Q> <PB N="133" REF="135">
And &s;o ingenious was &s;he <Q REND="inline">"to twi&s;t the true cau&s;e the "wrong way."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline had retired to her chamber to weep. When her fir&s;t agitations were &s;ub&s;ided, &s;he took an ample view of her conduct; and, per|ceiving nothing of which &s;he could accu&s;e her|&s;elf, &s;he became more &s;atisfied; deriving her be&s;t comfort from the integrity of her inten|tions. In the moment of accu&s;ation, innocence may &s;ometimes be oppre&s;&s;ed with the puni&s;h|ment due only to guilt; but reflection di&s;&s;olves the illu&s;ion of terror, and brings to the aching bo&s;om the con&s;olations of virtue.</P>
<P>When La Motte quitted the room, he had gone into the fore&s;t, which Louis ob&s;erving, he followed and joined them, with an intention of touching upon the &s;ubject of his melancholy. <Q REND="inline">"It is a fine morning, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Louis, <Q REND="inline">"if you will give me leave, I will walk with you."</Q> La Motte, though di&s;&s;atisfied, did not object; and after they had proceeded &s;ome way, he changed the cour&s;e of his walk, &s;triking into a path, con|trary to that which Louis had ob&s;erved him take on the foregoing day.</P>
<P>Louis remarked, that the avenue they had quitted was <Q REND="inline">"more &s;hady, and, therefore, more plea&s;ant."</Q> La Motte not &s;eeming to notice this remark, <Q REND="inline">"It leads to a &s;ingular &s;pot,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline">"which I di&s;covered ye&s;terday."</Q> La Motte rai&s;ed his head; Louis proceeded to de&s;cribe the tomb, and the
<PB N="134" REF="136">
adventure he had met with: during this relation, La Motte regarded him with attention, while his own countenance &s;uffered various changes. When he had concluded, <Q REND="inline">"You were very daring,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"to examine that place, particularly when you ventured down the pa&s;&s;age: I would advi&s;e you to be more cautious how you penetrate the depths of this fore&s;t. I, my&s;elf, have not ventured beyond a certain boundary; and am, therefore, un|informed what inhabitants it may harbour. Your account has alarmed me,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline">"for if banditti are in the neighbourhood, I am not &s;afe from their depredations: 'tis true, I have but little to lo&s;e, except my life."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And the lives of your family,"</Q> rejoined Louis,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Of cour&s;e,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It would be well to have more certainty upon that head,"</Q> rejoined Louis, <Q REND="inline">"I am con&s;idering how we may obtain it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"'Tis u&s;ele&s;s to con&s;ider that,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"the inquiry it&s;elf brings danger with it; your life would, perhaps, be paid for the indulgence of your curio&s;ity; our only chance of &s;afety is by endeavouring to re|main undi&s;covered. Let us move towards the abbey."</Q></P>
<P>Louis knew not what to think, but &s;aid no more upon the &s;ubject. La Motte &s;oon after relap&s;ed into a fit of mu&s;ing; and his &s;oon now took occa&s;ion to lament that depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits,
<PB N="135" REF="137">
which he had lately ob&s;erved in him. <Q REND="inline">"Rather lament the cau&s;e of it,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte with a &s;igh; <Q REND="inline">"That I do, mo&s;t &s;incerely, whatever it may be. May I venture to inquire, Sir, what is this cau&s;e?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Are, then, my misfortunes &s;o little known to you,"</Q> rejoined La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"as to make that que&s;tion nece&s;&s;ary? Am I not driven from my home, from my friends, and almo&s;t from my country? And &s;hall it be a&s;ked why I am afflicted?"</Q> Louis felt the ju&s;tice of this re|proof, and was a moment &s;ilent. <Q REND="inline">"That you are afflicted, Sir, does not excite my &s;urpri&s;e;"</Q> re&s;umed he, <Q REND="inline">"it would indeed be &s;trange, were you not."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What then does excite your &s;urpri&s;e?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The air of cheerfulne&s;s you wore when I fir&s;t came hither."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You lately lamented that I was afflicted,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"and now &s;eem not very well plea&s;ed that I once was cheerful. What is the meaning of this?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You much mi&s;take me,"</Q> &s;aid his &s;on, <Q REND="inline">"no|thing could give me &s;o much &s;atisfaction as to &s;ee that chearfulne&s;s renewed; the &s;ame cau&s;e of &s;orrow exi&s;ted at that time, yet you was then chearful."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That I was then cheerful,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"you might, without flattery, have attributed to your&s;elf; your pre&s;ence revived me, and
<PB N="136" REF="138">
I was relieved at the &s;ame time from a load of apprehen&s;ions."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, then, as the &s;ame cau&s;e exi&s;ts, are you not &s;till cheerful?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And why do you not recollect that it is your father you thus &s;peak to?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I do, Sir, and nothing but anxiety for my father, could have urged me thus far; it is with inexpre&s;&s;ible concern I perceive you have &s;ome &s;ecret cau&s;e of unea&s;ine&s;s; reveal it, Sir, to tho&s;e who claim a &s;hare in all your affliction, and &s;uffer them, by participation, to &s;often its &s;everity."</Q> Louis looked up, and ob&s;erved the countenance of his father, pale as death: his lips trembled while he &s;poke. <Q REND="inline">"Your penetration, however, you may rely upon it, has, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, deceived you. I have no &s;ubject of di&s;tre&s;s, but what you are already acquainted with, and I de&s;ire this con|ver&s;ation may never be renewed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If it is your de&s;ire, of cour&s;e, I obey,"</Q> &s;aid Louis; <Q REND="inline">"but, pardon me, Sir, if"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will <HI>not</HI> pardon you, Sir,"</Q> interrupted La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"let the di&s;cour&s;e end here."</Q> Saying this, he quickened his &s;teps, and Louis, not da|ring to pur&s;ue, walked quietly on till he reached the abbey.</P>
<P>Adeline pa&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t part of the day alone in her chamber, where, having examined her conduct, &s;he endeavoured to fortify her heart again&s;t the unmerited di&s;plea&s;ure of Madame La
<PB N="137" REF="139">
Motte. This was a ta&s;k more difficult than that of &s;elf acquittance. She loved her, and had relied on her friend&s;hip, which, notwith&s;tanding the conduct of Madame, &s;till appeared valuable to her. It was true, &s;he had not de&s;erved to lo&s;e it, but Madame was &s;o aver&s;e to explana|tion, that there was little probability of recover|ing it, however ill-founded might be the cau&s;e of her di&s;like. At length, &s;he rea&s;oned, or ra|ther, perhaps, per&s;uaded her&s;elf into tolerable compo&s;ure; for to re&s;ign a real good with con|tentment, is le&s;s an effort of rea&s;on than of tem|per.</P>
<P>For many hours &s;he bu&s;ied her&s;elf upon a piece of work, which &s;he had undertaken for Madame La Motte; and this &s;he did, without the lea&s;t intention of conciliating her favour, but becau&s;e &s;he felt there was &s;omething in thus repaying unkindne&s;s, which was &s;uitable to her own temper, her &s;entiments, and her pride. Self-love <HI>may</HI> be the center, round which the human affections move, for whatever motive con|duces to &s;elf-gratification may be re&s;olved into &s;elf-love; yet &s;ome of the&s;e affections are in their nature &s;o refined&mdash;that though we cannot deny their origin, they almo&s;t de&s;erve the name of virtue. Of this &s;pecies was that of Adeline.</P>
<P>In this employment and in reading Adeline pa&s;&s;ed as much of the day as po&s;&s;ible. From books, indeed, &s;he had con&s;tantly derived her chief information and amu&s;ement: tho&s;e belong|ing
<PB N="138" REF="140">
to La Motte were few, but well cho&s;en; and Adeline could find plea&s;ure in reading them more than once. When her mind was di&s;com|po&s;ed by the behaviour of Madame La Motte, or by a retro&s;pection of her early misfortunes, a book was the opiate that lulled it to repo&s;e. La Motte had &s;everal of the be&s;t Engli&s;h poets, a language which Adeline had learned in the con|vent; their beauties, therefore, &s;he was capable of ta&s;ting, and they often in&s;pired her with en|thu&s;ia&s;tic delight.</P>
<P>At the decline of day, &s;he quitted her cham|ber to enjoy the &s;weet evening hour, but &s;trayed no farther than an avenue near the abbey, which fronted the we&s;t. She read a little, but, finding it impo&s;&s;ible any longer to ab&s;tract her attention from rhe &s;cene around, &s;he clo&s;ed the book, and yielded to the &s;weet complacent me|lancholy which the hour in&s;pired. The air was &s;till, the &s;un, &s;inking below the di&s;tant hill, &s;pread a purple glow over the land&s;cape, and touched the fore&s;t glades with &s;ofter light. A dewy fre&s;hne&s;s was diffu&s;ed upon the air. As the &s;un de&s;cended, the du&s;k came &s;ilently on, and the &s;cene a&s;&s;umed a &s;olemn grandeur. As &s;he mu&s;ed, &s;he recollected and repeated the fol|lowing &s;tanzas:

<BIBL>MACBETH.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>NEAR a month elap&s;ed without any remark|able occurrence: the melancholy of La Motte &s;uffered little abatement; and the behaviour of Madame to Adeline, though &s;omewhat &s;oftened, was &s;till far from kind. Louis, by numberle&s;s little attentions, te&s;tified his growing affection for Adeline, who continued to treat them as pa&s;&s;in civilities.</P>
<P>It happened, one &s;tormy night, as they were pre|paring for re&s;t, that they were alarmed by a tram|pling of hor&s;es near the abbey. The &s;ound of &s;eve|ral voices &s;ucceeded, and a loud knocking at the great gate of the hall &s;oon after confirmed the alarm. La Motte had little doubt that the officers of ju&s;tice had at length di&s;covered his retreat, and the per|turbation of fear almo&s;t confounded his &s;en&s;es; he, however, ordered the lights to be extingui&s;h|ed, and a profound &s;ilence to be ob&s;erved, un|willing
<PB N="144" REF="146">
to neglect even the &s;lighte&s;t po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ecurity. There was a chance, he thought, that the per&s;ons might &s;uppo&s;e the place unin|habited, and believe they had mi&s;taken the object of their &s;earch. His orders were &s;carcely obey|ed, when the knocking was renewed, and with increa&s;ed violence. La Motte now repaired to a &s;mall grated window in the portal of the gate, that he might ob&s;erve the number and appear|ance of the &s;trangers.</P>
<P>The darkne&s;s of the night baffled his purpo&s;e; he could only perceive a groupe of men on hor&s;e|back; but, li&s;tening attentively, he di&s;tingui&s;hed a part of their di&s;cour&s;e. Several of the men contended, that they had mi&s;taken the place; till a per&s;on, who, from his authoritative voice, appeared to be their leader, affirmed, that the lights had i&s;&s;ued from this &s;pot, and he was po|&s;itive there were per&s;ons within. Having &s;aid this, he again knocked loudly at the gate, and was an&s;wered only by hollow echoes. La Mot|te's heart trembled at the &s;ound, and he was unable to move.</P>
<P>After waiting &s;ome time, the &s;trangers &s;eemed as if in con&s;ultation, but their di&s;cour&s;e was con|ducted in &s;uch a low tone of voice, that La Motte was unable to di&s;tingui&s;h its purport. They withdrew from the gate, as if to depart, but he pre&s;ently thought he heard them among&s;t the trees on the other &s;ide of the fabric, and &s;oon became convinced they had not left the abbey.
<PB N="145" REF="147">
A few minutes held La Motte in a &s;tate of tor|turing &s;u&s;pence; he quitted the grate, where Louis now &s;tationed him&s;elf, for that part of the edifice which overlooked the &s;pot where he &s;up|po&s;ed them to be waiting.</P>
<P>The &s;torm was now loud, and the hollow bla&s;ts, which ru&s;hed among the trees, prevented his di&s;tingui&s;hing any other &s;ound. Once, in the pau&s;es of the wind, he thought he heard di&s;tinct voices; but he was not long left to conjecture, for the renewed knocking at the gate again ap|palled him; and regardle&s;s of the terrors of Madame La Motte and Adeline, he ran to try his la&s;t chance of concealment, by means of the trap-door.</P>
<P>Soon after, the violence of the a&s;&s;ailants &s;eem|ing to increa&s;e with every gu&s;t of the tempe&s;t, the gate, which was old and decayed, bur&s;t from its hinges, and admitted them to the hall. At the moment of their entrance, a &s;cream from Madame La Motte, who &s;tood at the door of an adjoining apartment, confirmed the &s;u&s;picions of the principal &s;tranger, who continued to ad|vance, as fa&s;t as the darkne&s;s would permit him.</P>
<P>Adeline had fainted, and Madame La Motte was calling loudly for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, when Peter en|tered with lights, and di&s;covered the hall filled with men, and his young mi&s;tre&s;s &s;en&s;ele&s;s upon the floor. A chevalier now advanced, and &s;olicit|ing
<PB N="146" REF="148">
pardon of Madame for the rudene&s;s of his conduct, was attempting an apology, when per|ceiving Adeline, he ha&s;tened to rai&s;e her from the ground, but Louis, who now returned, caught her in his arms, and de&s;ired the &s;tranger not to interfere.</P>
<P>The per&s;on, to whom he &s;poke this, wore the &s;tar of one of the fir&s;t orders in France, and had an air of dignity, which declared him to be of &s;uperior rank. He appeared to be about for|ty, but, perhaps, the &s;pirit and fire of his coun|tenance made the impre&s;&s;ion of time upon his features le&s;s perceptible. His &s;oftened a&s;pect and in&s;inuating manners, while, regardle&s;s of him&s;elf, he &s;eemed attentive only to the condition of Adeline, gradually di&s;&s;ipated the apprehen|&s;ions of Madame La Motte, and &s;ubdued the &s;udden re&s;entment of Louis. Upon Adeline, who was yet in&s;en&s;ible, he gazed with an eager admiration, which &s;eemed to ab&s;orb all the faculties of his mind. She was, indeed, an object not to be contemplated with indiffe|rence.</P>
<P>Her beauty, touched with the languid delicacy of illne&s;s, gained from &s;entiment what it lo&s;t in bloom. The negligence of her dre&s;s, loo&s;ened for the purpo&s;e of freer re&s;piration, di&s;covered tho&s;e glowing charms, which her auburn tre&s;&s;es, that fell in profu&s;ion over her bo&s;om, &s;haded, but could not conceal.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="149">
There now entered another &s;tranger, a young Chevalier, who, having &s;poken ha&s;tily to the elder, joined the general groupe that &s;urrounded Adeline. He was of a per&s;on, in which ele|gance was happily blended with &s;trength, and had a countenance animated, but not haughty; noble, yet expre&s;&s;ive of peculiar &s;weetne&s;s. What rendered it at pre&s;ent more intere&s;ting, was the compa&s;&s;ion he &s;eemed to feel for Adeline, who now revived and &s;aw him, the fir&s;t object that met her eyes, bending over her in &s;ilent anxiety.</P>
<P>On perceiving him, a blu&s;h of quick &s;ur|prize pa&s;&s;ed over her cheek, for &s;he knew him to be the &s;tranger &s;he had &s;een in the fore&s;t. Her countenance in&s;tantly changed to the pale|ne&s;s of terror, when &s;he ob&s;erved the room crowded with people. Louis now &s;upported her into another apartment, where the two Cheva|liers, who followed her, again apologized for the alarm they had occa&s;ioned. The elder, turning to Madame La Motte, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"You are, no doubt, Madam, ignorant that I am the proprietor of this abbey."</Q> She &s;tarted: <Q REND="inline">"Be not alarmed, Madam, you are &s;afe and welcome. This ruinous &s;pot has been long abandoned by me, and if it has afforded you a &s;helter I am happy."</Q></P>
<P>Madame La Motte expre&s;&s;ed her gratitude for this conde&s;cen&s;ion, and Louis declared his &s;en&s;e
<PB N="148" REF="150">
of the politene&s;s of the Marquis de Montalt, for that was the name of the noble &s;tranger.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My chief re&s;idence,"</Q> &s;aid the Marquis, <Q REND="inline">"is in a di&s;tant province, but I have a chateau near the borders of the fore&s;t, and in return|ing from an excur&s;ion, I have been benighted and lo&s;t my way. A light, which gleamed through the trees, attracted me hither, and, &s;uch was the darkne&s;s without, that I did not know it proceeded from the abbey till I came to the door."</Q> The noble deportment of the &s;trangers, the &s;plendour of their apparel, and, above all, this &s;peech di&s;&s;ipated every re|maining doubt of Madame's, and &s;he was giving orders for refre&s;hments to be &s;et before them, when La Motte, who had li&s;tened, and was now convinced he had nothing to fear, entered the apartment.</P>
<P>He advanced towards the Marquis with a com|placent air, but as he would have &s;poke, the words of welcome faultered on his lips, his limbs trembled, and a gha&s;tly palene&s;s over&s;pread his countenance. The Marquis was little le&s;s agi|tated, and, in the fir&s;t moment of &s;urprize, put his hand upon his &s;word, but, recollecting him|&s;elf, he withdrew it, and endeavoured to obtain a command of features. A pau&s;e of agonizing &s;ilence en&s;ued. La Motte made &s;ome motion towards the door, but his agitated frame refu&s;ed to &s;upport him, and he &s;unk into a chair, &s;ilent and exhau&s;ted. The horror of his countenance,
<PB N="149" REF="151">
together with his whole behaviour, excited the utmo&s;t &s;urprize in Madame, who&s;e eyes in|quired of the Marquis more than he thought proper to an&s;wer: his looks increa&s;ed, in&s;tead of explaining the my&s;tery, and expre&s;&s;ed a mixture of emotions, which &s;he could not ana|ly&s;e. Meanwhile, &s;he endeavoured to &s;oothe and revive her hu&s;band, but he repre&s;&s;ed her efforts, and, averting his face, covered it with his hands.</P>
<P>The Marquis, &s;eeming to recover his pre|&s;ence of mind, &s;tepped to the door of the hall where his people were a&s;&s;embled, when La Motte, &s;tarting from his &s;eat, with a frantic air, called on him to return. The Marquis looked back and &s;topped, but &s;till he&s;itating whether to proceed; the &s;upplications of Ade|line, who was now returned, added to tho&s;e of La Motte, determined him, and he &s;at down. <Q REND="inline">"I reque&s;t of you, my Lord,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"that we may conver&s;e for a few moments by our&s;elves."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The reque&s;t is bold, and the indulgence, perhaps, dangerous,"</Q> &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">e Marquis: <Q REND="inline">"it is more al&s;o than I will grant. You can have nothing to &s;ay, with which your family are not acquainted&mdash;&s;peak your purpo&s;e and be brief."</Q> La Motte's complection varied to every &s;entence of this &s;peech. <Q REND="inline">"Impo&s;&s;ible, my Lord,"</Q> &s;aid he; <Q REND="inline">"my lips &s;hall clo&s;e for ever, ere they pronounce before another
<PB N="150" REF="152">
human being the words re&s;erved for you alone. I entreat&mdash;I &s;upplicate of you a few moments private di&s;cour&s;e."</Q> As he pro|nounced the&s;e words, tears &s;welled into his eyes, and the Marquis, &s;oftened by his di&s;tre&s;s, con|&s;ented, though with evident emotion and reluc|tance, to his reque&s;t.</P>
<P>La Motte took a light and led the Marquis to a &s;mall room in a remote part of the edifice, where they remained near an hour. Madame, alarmed by the length of their ab&s;ence, went in que&s;t of them: as &s;he drew near, a curio&s;ity, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, perhaps not unju&s;tifiable, prompted her to li&s;ten. La Motte ju&s;t then exclaimed&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"The phrenzy of de&s;pair!"&mdash;</Q>&s;ome words followed, delivered in a low tone, which which the could not under&s;tand&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I have &s;uffered more than I can expre&s;s,"</Q> continued he; <Q REND="inline">"the &s;ame image has pur&s;ued me in my midnight dream, and in my daily wanderings. There is no puni&s;hment, &s;hort of death, which I would not have endured, to regain the &s;tate of mind, with which I entered this fore&s;t. I again addre&s;s my&s;elf to your com|pa&s;&s;ion."</Q></P>
<P>A loud gu&s;t of wind, that bur&s;t along the pa&s;&s;age where Madame La Motte &s;tood, over|powered his voice and that of the Marquis, who &s;poke in reply: but &s;he &s;oon after di&s;tingui&s;hed the&s;e words,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"To-morrow, my Lord, if you
<PB N="151" REF="153">
return to the&s;e ruins, I will lead you to the &s;pot."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary, and may be dangerous,"</Q> &s;aid the Marquis. <Q REND="inline">"From you, my Lord, I can excu&s;e the&s;e doubts,"</Q> re&s;umed La Motte; <Q REND="inline">"but I will &s;wear what|ever you &s;hall propo&s;e. Yes,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline">"whatever may be the con&s;equence, I will &s;wear to &s;ubmit to your decree!"</Q> The ri&s;ing tempe&s;t again drowned the &s;ound of their voices, and Madame La Motte vainly endea|voured to hear tho&s;e words, upon which, pro|bably, hung the explanation of this my&s;terious conduct. They now moved towards the door, and &s;he retreated with precipitation to the apartment where &s;he had left Adeline, with Louis and the young Chevalier.</P>
<P>Hither the Marquis and La Motte &s;oon fol|lowed, the fir&s;t haughty and cool, the latter &s;omewhat more compo&s;ed than before, though the impre&s;&s;ion of horror was not yet faded from his countenance. The Marquis pa&s;&s;ed on to the hall where his retinue awaited: the &s;torm was not yet &s;ub&s;ided, but he &s;eemed impatient to be gone, and ordered his people to be in readine&s;s. La Motte ob&s;erved a &s;ullen &s;ilence, frequently pacing the room with ha&s;ty &s;teps, and &s;ometimes lo&s;t in reverie. Meanwhile, the Marquis, &s;eating him&s;elf by Adeline, directed to her his whole attention, except when &s;udden fits of ab&s;ence came over his mind and &s;u&s;pended
<PB N="152" REF="154">
him in &s;ilence: at the&s;e times the young Cheva|lier addre&s;&s;ed Adeline, who, with diffidence and &s;ome agitation, &s;hrunk from the ob&s;ervance of both.</P>
<P>The Marquis had been near two hours at the abbey, and the tempe&s;t &s;till continuing, Madame La Motte offered him a bed. A look from her hu&s;band made her tremble for the con&s;equence. Her offer was, however, politely declined, the Marquis being evidently as impatient to be gone, as his tenant appeared di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by his pre&s;ence. He often returned to the hall, and from the gates rai&s;ed a look of impatience to the clouds. No|thing was to be &s;een through the darkne&s;s of night&mdash;nothing heard but the howlings of the &s;torm.</P>
<P>The morning dawned before he departed. As he was preparing to leave the abbey, La Motte again drew him a&s;ide, and held him for a few moments in clo&s;e conver&s;ation. His impa&s;&s;ioned ge&s;tures, which Madame La Motte ob&s;erved from a remote part of the room, added to her curio&s;ity a degree of wild apprehen&s;ion, derived from the ob&s;curity of the &s;ubject. Her endeavour to di&s;tingui&s;h the corre&s;ponding words was baffled by the low voice in which they were uttered.</P>
<P>The Marquis and his retinue at length de|parted, and La Motte, having him&s;elf fa&s;tened the gates, &s;ilently and dejectedly withdrew to his chamber. The moment they were alone,
<PB N="153" REF="155">
Madame &s;eized the opportunity of entreating her hu&s;band to explain the &s;cene &s;he had witne&s;&s;ed. <Q REND="inline">"A&s;k me no que&s;tions,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte &s;ternly, <Q REND="inline">"for I will an&s;wer none. I have already forbade your &s;peaking to me on this &s;ubject."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What &s;ubject?"</Q> &s;aid his wife. La Motte &s;eemed to recollect him&s;elf&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"No matter&mdash;I was mi&s;taken&mdash;I thought you had repeated the&s;e que&s;tions before."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah!"</Q> &s;aid Madame La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"it is then as I &s;u&s;pected: your former melancholy, and the di&s;tre&s;s of this night, have the &s;ame cau&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And why &s;hould you either &s;u&s;pect or inquire? Am I always to be per&s;ecuted with conjectures?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pardon me, I meant not to per&s;ecute you; but my anxiety for your welfare will not &s;uffer me to re&s;t under this dreadful uncer|tainty. Let me claim the privilege of a wife, and &s;hare the affliction which oppre&s;&s;es you. Deny me not."&mdash;</Q>La Motte interrupted her, <Q REND="inline">"Whatever may be the cau&s;e of the emotions which you have witne&s;&s;ed, I &s;wear that I will not now reveal it. A time may come, when I &s;hall no longer judge concealment nece&s;&s;ary; till then be &s;ilent, and de&s;i&s;t from importunity; above all, forbear to remark to any one what you may have &s;een uncom|mon in me. Bury your &s;urmi&s;e in your own bo&s;om, as you would avoid my cur&s;e and my
<PB N="154" REF="156">
de&s;truction."</Q> The determined air with which he &s;poke this, while his countenance was over&s;pread with a livid hue, made his wife &s;hudder; and &s;he forbore all reply.</P>
<P>Madame La Motte retired to bed, but not to re&s;t. She ruminated on the pa&s;t occurrence; and her &s;urprize and curio&s;ity, concerning the words and behaviour of her hu&s;band, were but more &s;trongly &s;timulated by reflection. One truth, however, appeared; &s;he could not doubt, but the my&s;terious conduct of La Motte, which had for &s;o many months oppre&s;&s;ed her with anxiety, and the late &s;cene with the Marquis, originated from the &s;ame cau&s;e. This belief, which &s;eemed to prove how unju&s;tly &s;he had &s;u&s;pected Adeline, brought with it a pang of &s;elf-accu&s;ation. She looked forward to the morrow, which would lead the Marquis again to the abbey, with impatience. Wearied nature at length re&s;umed her rights, and yielded a &s;hort oblivion of care.</P>
<P>At a late hour, the next day, the family a&s;|&s;embled to breakfa&s;t. Each individual of the party appeared &s;ilent and ab&s;tracted, but very different was the a&s;pect of their features, and &s;till more the complection of their thoughts. La Motte &s;eemed agitated by impatient fear, yet the &s;ullenne&s;s of de&s;pair over&s;pread his coun|tenance. A certain wildne&s;s in his eye at times expre&s;&s;ed the &s;udden &s;tart of horror, and again
<PB N="155" REF="157">
his features would &s;ink into the gloom of de&s;|pondency.</P>
<P>Madame La Motte &s;eemed harra&s;&s;ed with anxiety; &s;he watched every turn of her hu&s;band's countenance, and impatiently waited the arrival of the Marquis. Louis was compo&s;ed and thoughtful. Adeline &s;eemed to feel her full &s;hare of unea&s;ine&s;s. She had ob&s;erved the beha|viour of La Motte the preceding night with much &s;urprize, and the happy confidence &s;he had hitherto repo&s;ed in him, was &s;haken. She feared al&s;o, le&s;t the exigency of his circum|&s;tances &s;hould precipitate him again into the world, and that he would be either unable or unwilling to afford her a &s;helter beneath his roof.</P>
<P>During breakfa&s;t, La Motte frequently ro&s;e to the window, from whence he ca&s;t many an anxious look. His wife under&s;tood too well the cau&s;e of his impatience, and endeavoured to re|pre&s;s her own. In the&s;e intervals, Louis at|tempted by whi&s;pers to obtain &s;ome informa|tion from his father, but La Motte always re|turned to the table, where the pre&s;ence of Ade|line prevented farther di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>After breakfa&s;t, as he walked upon the lawn, Louis would have joined him, but La Motte preremptorily declared he intended to be alone, and &s;oon after, the Marquis having not yet arrived, proceeded to a greater di&s;tance from the abbey.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="158">
Adeline retired into their u&s;ual working room with Madame La Motte, who affected an air of cheerfulne&s;s, and even of kindne&s;s. Feeling the nece&s;&s;ity of offering &s;ome rea&s;on for the &s;triking agitation of La Motte, and of pre|venting the &s;urprize, which the unexpected appearance of the Marquis would occa&s;ion Ade|line, if &s;he was l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">t to connect it with his beha|viour of the preceding night, &s;he mentioned that the Marquis and La Motte had long been known to each other, and that this unexpected meeting, after an ab&s;ence of many years, and under circum&s;tances &s;o altered and humiliating, on the part of the latter, had occa&s;ioned him much painful emotion. This had been height|ened by a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that the Marquis had formerly mi&s;interpreted &s;ome circum&s;tances in his conduct towards him, which had cau&s;ed a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of their intimacy.</P>
<P>This account did not bring conviction to the mind of Adeline, for it &s;eemed inadequate to the degree of emotion, the Marquis and La Motte had mutually betrayed. Her &s;urprize was excited, and her curio&s;ity awakened by the words, which were meant to delude them both. But &s;he forbore to expre&s;s her thoughts.</P>
<P>Madame proceeding with her plan, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"The Marquis was now expected, and &s;he hoped whatever differences remained, would be perfectly adju&s;ted."</Q> Adeline blu&s;hed, and endeavouring to reply, her lips faltered.
<PB N="157" REF="159">
Con&s;cious of this agitation, and of the ob&s;ervance of Madame La Motte, her confu&s;ion increa&s;ed, and her endeavours to &s;uppre&s;s &s;erved only to heighten it. Still &s;he tried to renew the di&s;|cour&s;e, and &s;till &s;he found it impo&s;&s;ible to collect her thoughts. Shocked le&s;t Madame &s;hould apprehend the &s;entiment, which had till this moment been concealed almo&s;t from her&s;elf, her colour fled, &s;he fixed her eyes on the ground, and, for &s;ome time, found it difficult to re&s;pire. Madame La Motte inquired if &s;he was ill, when Adeline, glad of the excu&s;e, withdrew to the indulgence of her own thoughts, which were now wholly engro&s;&s;ed by the expectation of &s;eeing again the young Chevalier, who had ac|companied the Marquis.</P>
<P>As &s;he looked from her room, &s;he &s;aw the Marquis on hor&s;eback, with &s;everal attendants, advancing at a di&s;tance, and &s;he ha&s;tened to ap|prize Madame La Motte of his approach. In a &s;hort time, he arrived at the gates, and Ma|dame and Louis went out to receive him, La Motte being not yet returned. He entered the hall, followed by the young Chevalier, and acco&s;ting Madame with a &s;ort of &s;tately polite|ne&s;s, inquired for La Motte, whom Louis now went to &s;eek.</P>
<P>The Marquis remained for a few minutes &s;ilent, and then a&s;ked of Madame La Motte <Q REND="inline">"how her fair daughter did?"</Q> Madame under|&s;tood it was Adeline he meant, and having an|&s;wered
<PB N="158" REF="160">
his inquiry, and &s;lightly &s;aid that &s;he was not related to them, Adeline, upon &s;ome indication of the Marquis's wi&s;h, was &s;ent for. She entered the room with a mode&s;t blu&s;h and a timid air, which &s;eemed to engage all his attention. His compliments &s;he received with a &s;weet grace, but, when the younger Chevalier approached, the warmth of his manner ren|dered her's involuntarily more re&s;erved, and &s;he &s;carcely dared to rai&s;e her eyes from the ground, le&s;t they &s;hould encounter his.</P>
<P>La Motte now entered and apologized for his ab&s;ence, which the Marquis noticed only by a &s;light inclination of his head, expre&s;&s;ing at the &s;ame time by his looks, both di&s;tru&s;t and pride. They immediately quitted the abbey together, and the Marquis beckoned his attendants to follow at a di&s;tance. La Motte forbade his &s;on to accompany him, but Louis ob&s;erved he took the way into the thicke&s;t part of the fore&s;t. He was lo&s;t in a chaos of conjecture concerning this affair, but eurio&s;ity and anxiety for his father induced him to follow at &s;ome di&s;tance.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the young &s;tranger, whom the Marquis addre&s;&s;ed by the name of Theodore, remained at the abbey with Madame La Motte and Adeline. The former, with all her ad|dre&s;s, could &s;carcely conceal her agitation dur|ing this interval. She moved involuntarily to the door, whenever &s;he heard a foot&s;tep, and &s;everal times &s;he went to the hall door, in order
<PB N="159" REF="161">
to look into the fore&s;t, but as often returned, checked by di&s;appointment. No per&s;on ap|peared. Theodore &s;eemed to addre&s;s as much of his attention to Adeline, as politene&s;s would allow him to withdraw from Madame La Motte. His manners &s;o gentle, yet dignified, in&s;en&s;ibly &s;ubdued her timidity, and bani&s;hed her re&s;erve. Her conver&s;ation no longer &s;uf|fered a painful con&s;traint, but gradually di&s;|clo&s;ed the beauties of her mind, and &s;eemed to produce a mutual confidence. A &s;imilarity of &s;entiment &s;oon appeared, and Theodore, by the impatient plea&s;ure which animated his coun|tenance, &s;eemed frequently to anticipate the thought of Adeline.</P>
<P>To them the ab&s;ence of the Marquis was &s;hort, though long to Madame La Motte, who&s;e countenance brightened, when &s;he heard the trampling of hor&s;es at the gate.</P>
<P>The Marquis appeared but for a moment, and pa&s;&s;ed on with La Motte to a private room, where they remained for &s;ome time in confer|ence, immediately after which he departed Theodore took leave of Adeline, who, as well as La Motte and Madame, attended them to the gates, with an expre&s;&s;ion of tender regret, and, often as he went, looked back upon the abbey, till the intervening branches intirely excluded it from his view.</P>
<P>The tran&s;ient glow of plea&s;ure diffu&s;ed over the cheek of Adeline di&s;appeared with the young
<PB N="160" REF="162">
&s;tranger, and &s;he &s;ighed as &s;he turned into the hall. The image of Theodore pur&s;ued her to her chamber; &s;he recollected with exactne&s;s every particular of his late conver&s;ation&mdash;his &s;entiments &s;o congenial with her own&mdash;his man|ners &s;o engaging&mdash;his countenance &s;o animated&mdash;&s;o ingenuous and &s;o noble, in which manly dignity was blended with the &s;weetne&s;s of bene|volence&mdash;the&s;e, and every other grace, &s;he re|collected, and a &s;oft melancholy &s;tole upon her heart. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall &s;ee him no more,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he. A &s;igh, that followed, told her more of her heart than &s;he wi&s;hed to know. She blu&s;hed, and &s;ighed again, and then &s;uddenly recollecting her|&s;elf, &s;he endeavoured to divert her thoughts to a different &s;ubject. La Motte's connection with the Marquis for &s;ome time engaged her attenti|on, but, unable to develope the my&s;tery that at|tended it, &s;he &s;ought a refuge from her own re|flections in the more plea&s;ing ones to be derived from books.</P>
<P>During this time, Louis, &s;hocked and &s;urprized at the extreme di&s;tre&s;s which his father had mani|fe&s;ted upon the fir&s;t appearance of the Marquis, addre&s;&s;ed him upon the &s;ubject. He had no doubt that the Marquis was intimately concerned in the event which made it nece&s;&s;ary for La Motte to leave Paris, and he &s;poke his thoughts without di&s;gui&s;e, lamenting at the &s;ame time the unlucky chance, which had brought him to &s;eek
<PB N="161" REF="163">
refuge in a place, of all others, the lea&s;t capable of affording it&mdash;the e&s;tate of his enemy. La Motte did not contradict this opinion of his &s;on's, and joined in lamenting the evil fate which had conducted him thither.</P>
<P>The term of Louis's ab&s;ence from his regi|ment, was now nearly expired, and be took oc|ca&s;ion to expre&s;s his &s;orrow, that he mu&s;t &s;oon be obliged to leave his father in circum&s;tances &s;o dangerous as the pre&s;ent. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould leave you, Sir, with le&s;s pain,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline">"was I &s;ure I knew the full extent of your misfor|tunes. At pre&s;ent I am left to conjecture evils, which, perhaps, do not exi&s;t. Relieve me, Sir, from this &s;tate of painful uncertainty, and &s;uffer me to prove my&s;elf worthy of your confidence."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have already an&s;wered you on this &s;ub|ject,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"and forbade you to renew it. I am now obliged to tell you, I care not how &s;oon you depart, if I am to be &s;ub|jected to the&s;e inquiries."</Q> La Motte walked abruptly away, and left his &s;on to doubt and concern.</P>
<P>The arrival of the Marquis had di&s;&s;ipated the jealous fears of Madame La Motte, and &s;he awoke to a &s;en&s;e of her cruelty towards Adeline. When &s;he con&s;idered her orphan &s;tate&mdash;the uni|form affection which had appeared in her beha|viour&mdash;the mildne&s;s and patience with which &s;he
<PB N="162" REF="164">
had borne her injurious treatment, &s;he was &s;hocked, and took an early opportunity of re|newing her former kindne&s;s. But &s;he could not explain this &s;eeming incon&s;i&s;tency of conduct, without b etraying her late &s;u&s;picions, which &s;he now blu&s;hed to remember, nor could &s;he apelo|gi&s;e for her former behaviour, without giving this explanation.</P>
<P>She contented her&s;elf, therefore, with expre&s;|&s;ing in her manner the regard which was thus revived. Adeline was at fir&s;t &s;urprized, but &s;he felt too much plea&s;ure at the change to be &s;cru|pulous in inquiring its cau&s;e.</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding the &s;atisfaction which Adeline received from the revival of Madame La Motte's kindne&s;s, her thoughts frequently re|curred to the peculiar and forlorn circum&s;tances of her condition. She could not help feeling le&s;s confidence than &s;he had formerly done in the friend&s;hip of Madame La Motte, who&s;e character now appeared le&s;s amiable than her imagination had repre&s;ented it, and &s;eemed &s;trongly tinc|tured with caprice. Her thoughts often dwelt upon the &s;trange introduction of the Marquis at the abbey, and on the mutual emotions and ap|parent di&s;like of La Motte and him&s;elf; and, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, it equally excited her &s;urprize that La Motte &s;hould chu&s;e, and that the Marquis &s;hould permit him, to remain in his territory.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="165">
Her mind returned the oftener, perhaps, to this &s;ubject, becau&s;e it was connected with Theo|dore; but it returned uncon&s;cious of the idea which attracted it. She attributed the intere&s;t &s;he felt in the affair to her anxiety for the welfare of La Motte, and for her own future de&s;tination, which was now &s;o deeply involved in his. Some|times, indeed, &s;he caught her&s;elf bu&s;y in conjec|ture as to the degree of relation&s;hip in which Theodore &s;tood to the Marquis, but &s;he imme|diately checked her thoughts, and &s;everely blamed her&s;elf for having &s;uffered them to &s;tray to an object, which &s;he perceived was too dangerous to her peace.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>A Few days after the occurrence related in the preceding chapter, as Adeline was alone in her chamber, &s;he was rou&s;ed from a reverie by a trampling of hor&s;es near the gate, and, on looking from the ca&s;ement, &s;he &s;aw the Marquis de Montalt enter the abbey. This circum&s;tance &s;urprized her, and an emotion, who&s;e cau&s;e &s;he
<PB N="164" REF="166">
did not trouble her&s;elf to inquire for, made her in&s;tantly retreat from the window. The &s;ame cau&s;e, however, led her thither again as ha&s;tily, but the object of her &s;earch did not appear, and &s;he was in no ha&s;te to retire.</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;tood mu&s;ing and di&s;appointed, the Marquis came out with La Motte, and, imme|diately looking up, &s;aw Adeline and bowed. She returned his compliment re&s;pectfully, and withdrew from the window, vexed at having been &s;een there. They went into the fore&s;t, but the Marquis's attendants did not, as before, follow them thither. When they returned, which was not till after a con&s;iderable time, the Mar|quis immediately mounted his hor&s;e and rode away.</P>
<P>For the remainder of the day, La Motte ap|peared gloomy and &s;ilent, and was frequently lo&s;t in thought. Adeline ob&s;erved him with par|ticular attention and concern; &s;he perceived that he was always more melancholy after an interview with the Marquis, and was now &s;ur|prized to hear that the latter had appointed to dine the next day at the abbey.</P>
<P>When La Motte mentioned this, he added &s;ome high eulogiums on the character of the Mar|quis, and particularly prai&s;ed his genero&s;ity and noblene&s;s of &s;oul. At this in&s;tant, Adeline re|collected the anecdotes &s;he had formerly heard concerning the abbey, and they threw a &s;hadow over the brightne&s;s of that excellence, which La
<PB N="165" REF="167">
Motte now celebrated. The account, however, did not appear to de&s;erve much credit; a part of it, as far as a negative will admit of demon&s;tra|tion, having been already proved fal&s;e; for it had been reported, that the abbey was haunted, and no &s;upernatural appearance had ever been ob&s;erved by the pre&s;ent inha|bitants.</P>
<P>Adeline, however, ventured to inquire, whe|ther it was the pre&s;ent Marquis of whom tho&s;e injurious reports had been rai&s;ed? La Motte an&s;wered her with a &s;mile of ridicule; <Q REND="inline">"Stories of gho&s;ts and hobgoblins have always been admired and cheri&s;hed by the vulgar,"</Q> &s;aid he. <Q REND="inline">"I am inclined to rely upon my own ex|perience, at lea&s;t as much as upon the ac|counts of the&s;e pea&s;ants. If you have &s;een any thing to corroborate the&s;e accounts, pray in|form me of it, that I may e&s;tabli&s;h my faith."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You mi&s;take me, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"it was not concerning &s;upernatural agency that I would inquire: I alluded to a different part of the report, which hinted, that &s;ome per&s;on had been confined here, by order of the Mar|quis, who was &s;aid to have died unfairly This was alledged as a rea&s;on for the Mar|quis's having abandoned the abbey."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"All the mere coinage of idlene&s;s,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte; <Q REND="inline">"a romantic tale to excite wonder: to &s;ee the Marquis is alone &s;ufficient to refute
<PB N="166" REF="168">
this; and if we credit half the number of tho&s;e &s;tories that &s;pring from the &s;ame &s;ource, we prove our&s;elves little &s;uperior to the &s;imple|tons who invent them. Your good &s;en&s;e, Adeline, I think, will teach you the merit of di&s;belief."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline blu&s;hed and was &s;ilent; but La Mot|te's defence of the Marquis appeared much war|mer and more diffu&s;e than was con&s;i&s;tent with his own di&s;po&s;ition, or required by the occa&s;ion. His former conver&s;ation with Louis occurred to her, and &s;he was the more &s;urpri&s;ed at what pa&s;&s;ed at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>She looked forward to the morrow with a mixture of pain and plea&s;ure; the expectation of &s;eeing again the young Chevalier occupying her thoughts, and agitating them with a various emotion: now &s;he feared his pre&s;ence, and now &s;he doubted whether he would come. At length &s;he ob&s;erved this, and blu&s;hed to find how much he engaged her attention. The morrow arrived&mdash;the Marquis came&mdash;but he came alone; and the &s;un&s;hine of Adeline's mind was clouded, though &s;he was able to wear her u&s;ual air of cheerfulne&s;s. The Marquis was polite, affable, and attentive: to manners the mo&s;t ea&s;y and ele|gant, was added the la&s;t refinement of poli&s;hed life. His conver&s;ation was lively, amu&s;ing, &s;ometimes even witty; and di&s;covered great knowledge of the world; or, what is often mi&s;|taken
<PB N="167" REF="169">
for it, an acquaintance with the higher circles, and with the topics of the day.</P>
<P>Here La Motte was al&s;o qualified to conver&s;e with him, and they entered into a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the characters and manners of the age with great &s;pirit and &s;ome humour. Madame La Motte had not &s;een her hu&s;band &s;o cheerful &s;ince they left Paris, and &s;ometimes &s;he could almo&s;t fancy &s;he was there. Adeline li&s;tened, till the cheerfulne&s;s, which &s;he had at fir&s;t only a&s;&s;umed, became real. The addre&s;s of the Marquis was &s;o in&s;inuating and affable, that her re&s;erve in&s;en|&s;ibly gave way before it, and her natural vi|vacity re&s;umed its long lo&s;t empire.</P>
<P>At parting, the Marquis told La Motte he re|joiced at having found &s;o agreeable a neighbour. La Motte bowed. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall &s;ometimes vi&s;it you,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline">"and I lament that I can|not at pre&s;ent invite Madame La Motte, and her fair friend to my chateau, but it is under|going &s;ome repairs, which make it but an un|comfortable re&s;idence."</Q></P>
<P>The vivacity of La Motte di&s;appeared with his gue&s;t, and he &s;oon relap&s;ed into fits of &s;ilence and ab&s;traction. <Q REND="inline">"The Marquis is a very agreeable man,"</Q> &s;aid Madame La Motte <Q REND="inline">"Very agreeable,"</Q> replied he. <Q REND="inline">"And &s;eems to have an excellent heart,"</Q> &s;he re&s;umed. <Q REND="inline">"An excellent one,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You &s;eem di&s;compo&s;ed, my dear; what has di&s;turbed you?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="170">
<Q REND="inline">"Not in the lea&s;t&mdash;I was only thinking, that with &s;uch agreeable talents, and &s;uch an ex|cellent heart, it was a pity the Marquis &s;hould"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What? my dear,"</Q> &s;aid Madame with im|patience: <Q REND="inline">"That the Marquis &s;hould&mdash;&s;hould &s;uffer this abbey to fall into ruins,"</Q> re|plied La Motte.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is that all!"</Q> &s;aid Madame with di&s;appoint|ment&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"That is all, upon my honour,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte, and left the room.</P>
<P>Adeline's &s;pirits, no longer &s;upported by the animated conver&s;ation of the Marquis, &s;unk into languour, and, when he departed, &s;he walked pen&s;ively into the fore&s;t. She followed a little romantic path that would along the margin of the &s;tream, and was overhung with deep &s;hades. The tranquility of the &s;cene, which autumn now touched with her &s;weete&s;t tints, &s;oftened her mind to a teuder kind of melancholy, and &s;he &s;uffered a tear, which, &s;he knew not where|fore, had &s;tolen into her eye, to tremble there unchecked. She came to a little lonely rece&s;s, formed by high trees; the wind &s;ighed mourn|fully among the branches, and as it waved their lofty heads &s;cattered their leaves to the ground. She &s;eated her&s;elf on a bank beneath, and in|dulged the melancholy reflections that pre&s;&s;ed on her mind.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O! could I dive into futurity and behold behold the events which await me!"</Q> &s;aid
<PB N="169" REF="171">
&s;he; <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould, perhaps, by con&s;tant contem|plation, be enabled to meet them with forti|tude. An orphan in this wide world&mdash;thrown upon the friend&s;hip of &s;trangers for comfort, and upon their bounty for the very means of exi&s;tence, what but evil have I to expect! Alas, my father! how could you thus abandon your child&mdash;how leave her to the &s;torms of life&mdash;to &s;ink, perhaps, be|neath them? Alas, I have no friend!"</Q></P>
<P>She was interrupted by a ru&s;tling among the fallen leaves; &s;he turned her head, and perceiving the Marquis's young friend, aro&s;e to depart. <Q REND="inline">"Pardon this intru&s;ion,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"your voice attracted me hither, and your words detained me; my offence, however, brings with it its own puni&s;hment, having learned your &s;or|rows&mdash;how can I help feeling them my&s;elf? would that my &s;ympathy, or my &s;uffering, could re&s;cue you from them!"&mdash;</Q>He he&s;itated <Q REND="inline">"&mdash;Would that I could de&s;erve the title of your friend, and be thought worthy of it by your|&s;elf!"</Q></P>
<P>The confu&s;ion of Adeline's thoughts could &s;carcely permit her to reply; &s;he trembled and gently withdrew her hand, which he had taken, while he &s;poke. <Q REND="inline">"You have, perhaps, heard, Sir, more than is true: I am, indeed, not happy, but a moment of dejection has made me unju&s;t, and I am le&s;s unfortunate than I have repre&s;ented. When I &s;aid I had no
<PB N="170" REF="172">
friend, I was ungrateful to the kindne&s;s of Mon&s;ieur and Madame La Motte, who have been more than friends&mdash;have been as parents to me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If &s;o, I honour them,"</Q> cried Theodore with warmth; <Q REND="inline">"and if I did not feel it to be pre|&s;umption, I would a&s;k why you are unhappy?&mdash;But"&mdash;</Q>He pau&s;ed. Adeline, rai&s;ing her eyes, &s;aw him gazing upon her with inten&s;e and eager anxiety, and her looks were again fixed upon the ground. <Q REND="inline">"I have pained you,"</Q> &s;aid Theodore, <Q REND="inline">"by an improper reque&s;t. Can you forgive me, and al&s;o when I add, that it was an intere&s;t in your welfare, which urged my inquiry?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Forgivene&s;s, Sir, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to a&s;k. I am certainly obliged by the compa&s;&s;ion you expre&s;s. But the evening is cold, if you plea&s;e, we will walk towards the abbey."</Q> As they moved on, Theodore was for &s;ome time &s;ilent. At length, <Q REND="inline">"It was but lately that I &s;o|licited your pardon,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"and I &s;hall now, perhaps, have need of it again; but you will do me the ju&s;tice to believe, that I have a &s;trong, and, indeed, a pre&s;&s;ing rea&s;on to inquire how nearly you are related to Mon|&s;ieur La Motte."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"We are not at all related,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline; <Q REND="inline">"but the &s;ervice he has done me I can never re|pay, and I hope my gratitude will teach me never to forget it."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="173">
<Q REND="inline">"Indeed!"</Q> &s;aid Theodore, &s;urprized: and <Q REND="inline">"may I a&s;k how long you have known him?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Rather, Sir, let me a&s;k, why the&s;e que&s;|tions &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are ju&s;t,"</Q> &s;aid he, with an air of &s;elf|condemnation, <Q REND="inline">"my conduct has de&s;erved this reproof; I &s;hould have been more explicit."</Q> He looked as if his mind was labouring with &s;ome|thing which he was unwilling to expre&s;s. <Q REND="inline">"But you know not how delicately I am circum|&s;tanced,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline">"yet I will aver, that my que&s;tions are prompted by the ten|dere&s;t intere&s;t in your happine&s;s&mdash;and even by my fears for your &s;afety."</Q> Adeline &s;tarted. <Q REND="inline">"I fear you are deceived,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"I fear there's danger near you."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline &s;topped, and, looking earne&s;tly at him, begged he would explain him&s;elf. She &s;u&s;pected that &s;ome mi&s;chief threatened La Motte; and Theodore continuing &s;ilent, &s;he re|peated her reque&s;t. <Q REND="inline">"If La Motte is concer|ned in this danger,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"let me en|treat you to acquaint him with it immedi|ately. He has but too many misfortunes to apprehend."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Excellent Adeline!"</Q> cried Theodore, <Q REND="inline">"that heart mu&s;t be adamant that would injure you. How &s;hall I hint what I fear is too true, and how forbear to warn you of your danger with|out"&mdash;</Q>He was interrupted by a &s;tep among the trees, and pre&s;ently after &s;aw La Motte cro&s;s
<PB N="172" REF="174">
into the path they were in. Adeline felt confu|&s;ed at being thus &s;een with the Chevalier, and was ha&s;tening to join La Motte, but Theodore detained her, and entreated a moment's atten|tion. <Q REND="inline">"There is now no time to explain my|&s;elf,"</Q> &s;aid he; yet what I would &s;ay is of the <Q REND="inline">"utmo&s;t con&s;equence to <HI>your&s;elf.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Promi&s;e, therefore, to meet me in &s;ome part of the fore&s;t at about this time to-mor|row evening, you will then, I hope, be con|vinced, that my conduct is directed, neither by common circum&s;tances, nor common re|gard."</Q> Adeline &s;huddered at the idea of making an appointment; &s;he he&s;itated, and at length entreated Theodore not to delay till to|morrow an explanation, which appeared to be &s;o important, but to follow La Motte and inform him of his danger immediately. <Q REND="inline">"It is not with La Motte I would &s;peak,"</Q> replied Theodore; <Q REND="inline">"I know of no danger that threatens him&mdash;but he approaches, be quick, lovely Adeline, and promi&s;e to meet me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I do promi&s;e,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline, with a fal|tering voice; <Q REND="inline">"I will come to the &s;pot where you found me this evening, an hour earlier to|morrow."</Q> Saying this, &s;he withdrew her trembling hand, which Theodore had pre&s;&s;ed to his lips in token of acknowledgment, and he immediately di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>La Motte now approached Adeline, who, fearing that he had &s;een Theodore, was in &s;ome
<PB N="173" REF="175">
confu&s;ion. <Q REND="inline">"Whither is Louis gone &s;o fa&s;t?"</Q> &s;aid La Motte. She rejoiced to find his mi&s;take, and &s;uffered him to remain in it. They walked pen&s;ively towards the abbey, where Adeline, too much occupied by her own thoughts to bear company, retired to her chamber. She rumi|nated upon the words of Theodore, and the more &s;he con&s;idered them, the more &s;he was perplexed. Sometimes &s;he blamed her&s;elf for having made an appointment, doubting whether he had not &s;olicited it for the purpo&s;e of pleading a pa&s;&s;ion; and now delicacy checked this thought, and made her vexed that &s;he had pre&s;umed upon having in&s;pired one. She recollected the &s;erious earne&s;tne&s;s of his voice and manner, when he entreated her to meet him; and as they convin|ced her of the importance of the &s;ubject, &s;he &s;huddered at a danger, which &s;he could not com|prehend, looking forward to the morrow with anxious impatience.</P>
<P>Sometimes too a remembrance of the tender intere&s;t he had expre&s;&s;ed for her welfare, and of his corre&s;pondent look and air, would &s;teal acro&s;s her memory, awakening a plea&s;ing emo|tion and a latent hope that &s;he was not indiffer|ent to him. From reflections like the&s;e &s;he was rou&s;ed by a &s;ummons to &s;upper: the repa&s;t was a melancholy one, it being the la&s;t evening of Louis's &s;tay at the abbey. Adeline, who e&s;|teemed him, regretted his departure, while his eyes were often bent on her with a look, which
<PB N="174" REF="176">
&s;eemed to expre&s;s that he was about to leave the object of his affection. She endeavoured by her cheerfulne&s;s to re-animate the whole party, and e&s;pecially Madame La Motte, who frequently &s;hed tears. <Q REND="inline">"We &s;hall &s;oon meet again,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline, <Q REND="inline">"I tru&s;t, in happier circum&s;tances."</Q> La Motte &s;ighed. The countenance of Louis brightened at her words, <Q REND="inline">"Do you wi&s;h it?"</Q> &s;aid he, with peculiar empha&s;is. <Q REND="inline">"Mo&s;t cer|tainly I do,"</Q> &s;he replied. <Q REND="inline">"Can you doubt my regard for my be&s;t friends?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I cannot doubt any thing that is good for you,"</Q> &s;aid he.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You forget you have left Paris,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte to his &s;on, while a faint &s;inile cro&s;&s;ed his face, <Q REND="inline">"&s;uch a compliment would there be in character with the place&mdash;in the&s;e &s;olitary woods it is quite <HI>outr&eacute;.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The language of admiration is not always that of compliment, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Louis. Ade|line, willing to change the di&s;cour&s;e, a&s;ked, to what part of France he was going. He replied, that his regiment was now at Peronne, and he &s;hould go immediately thither. After &s;ome men|tion of indifferent &s;ubjects, the family withdrew for the night to their &s;everal chambers.</P>
<P>The approaching departure of her &s;on occu|pied the thoughts of Madame La Motte, and &s;he appeared at breakfa&s;t with eyes &s;woln with weep|ing. The pale countenance of Louis &s;eemed to indicate that he had re&s;ted no better than his

mother. When breakfa&s;t was over, Adeline retired for a while, that &s;he might not interrupt, by her pre&s;ence, their la&s;t conver&s;ation. As &s;he walked on the lawn before the abbey &s;he returned in thought to the occurrence of ye&s;terday evening, and her impatience for the appointed interview increa&s;ed. She was &s;oon joined by Louis. <Q REND="inline">"It was unkind of you to leave us,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"in the la&s;t moments of my &s;tay. Could I hope that you would &s;ometimes remember me, when I am far away, I &s;hould depart with le&s;s &s;orrow."</Q> He then expre&s;&s;ed his concern at leaving her, and though he had hitherto arm|ed him&s;elf with re&s;olution to forbear a direct avowal of an attachment, which mu&s;t be fruitle&s;s, his heart now yielded to the force of pa&s;&s;ion, and he told what Adeline every moment feared to hear.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This declaration,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline, endea|vouring to overcome the agitation is excited, <Q REND="inline">"gives me inexpre&s;&s;ible concern."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, &s;ay not &s;o!"</Q> interrupted Louis, <Q REND="inline">"but give me &s;ome &s;lender hope to &s;upport me in the mi&s;eries of ab&s;ence. Say that you do not hate me&mdash;Say"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That I do mo&s;t readily &s;ay,"</Q> replied Ade|line, in a tremulous voice; <Q REND="inline">"if it will give you plea&s;ure to be a&s;&s;ured of my e&s;teem and friend&s;hip&mdash;receive this a&s;&s;urance:&mdash;as the &s;on of my be&s;t benefactors, you are entitled to"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="178">
<Q REND="inline">"Name not benefits,"</Q> &s;aid Louis, <Q REND="inline">"your merits out run them all: and &s;uffer me to hope for a &s;entiment le&s;s cool than that of friend&s;hip, as well as to believe that I do not owe your approbation of me to the actions of others. I have long borne my pa&s;&s;ion in &s;ilence, becau&s;e I fore&s;aw the difficulties that would attend it, nay, I have even dared to en|deavour to overcome it: I have dared to be|lieve it po&s;&s;ible, forgive the &s;uppo&s;ition, that I could forget you&mdash;and"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You di&s;tre&s;s me,"</Q> interrupted Adeline; <Q REND="inline">"this is a conver&s;ation which I ought not to hear. I am above di&s;gui&s;e, and, therefore, a&s;&s;ure you, that, though your virtues will always command my e&s;teem, you have no|thing to hope from my love. Were it even otherwi&s;e, our circum&s;tances would effectually decide for us. If you are really my friend, you will rejoice that I am &s;pared this &s;truggle between affection and prudence. Let me hope al&s;o, that time will teach you to reduce love within the limits of friend&s;hip."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Never!"</Q> cried Louis vehemently: <Q REND="inline">"Were this po&s;&s;ible, my pa&s;&s;ion would be unworthy of its object."</Q> While he &s;poke, Adeline's favourite fawn came bounding towards her. This circum&s;tance affected Louis even to tears. <Q REND="inline">"This little animal,"</Q> &s;aid he, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"fir&s;t conducted me to you: it was wit|ne&s;s to that happy moment when I fir&s;t &s;aw
<PB N="177" REF="179">
you, &s;urrounded by attractions too powerful for my heart; that moment is now fre&s;h in my memory, and the creature comes even to wit|ne&s;s this &s;ad one of my departure."</Q> Grief interrupted his utterance.</P>
<P>When he recovered his voice, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Ade|line! when you look upon your little favourite and care&s;s it, remember the unhappy Louis, who will then be far&mdash;far from you. Do not deny me the poor con&s;olation of believing this!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall not require &s;uch a monitor to remind me of you,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline with a &s;mile; <Q REND="inline">"your excellent parents and your own merits have &s;ufficient claim upon my remembrance. Could I &s;ee your natural good &s;en&s;e re&s;ume its influence over pa&s;&s;ion, my &s;atisfaction would equal my e&s;teem for you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do not hope it,"</Q> &s;aid Louis, <Q REND="inline">"nor will I wi&s;h it&mdash;for pa&s;&s;ion here is virtue"</Q> As he &s;poke, he &s;aw La Motte turn round an angle of the abbey. <Q REND="inline">"The moments are precious,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"I am interrupted. O! Adeline, fare|well! and &s;ay, that you will &s;ometimes think of me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Farewell,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline, who was affected by his di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"farewell! and peace attend you. I will think of you with the affection of a &s;i&s;ter."&mdash;</Q>He &s;ighed deeply, and pre&s;&s;ed her hand; when La Motte, winding round another projection of the ruin, again appeared. Ade|line
<PB N="178" REF="180">
left them together, and withdrew to her chamber, oppre&s;&s;ed by the &s;cene. Louis's pa&s;&s;ion and her e&s;teem were too &s;incere not to in&s;pire her with a &s;trong degree of pity for his unhappy attachment. She remained in her chamber till he had quitted the abbey, unwil|ling to &s;ubject him or her&s;elf to the pain of a formal parting.</P>
<P>As evening and the hour of appointment drew nigh, Adeline's impatience increa&s;ed; yet, when the time arrived, her re&s;olution failed, and &s;he faltered from her purpo&s;e. There was &s;omething of indelicacy and di&s;|&s;imulation in an <HI>appointed</HI> interview, on her part, that &s;hocked her. She recollected the tender|ne&s;s of Theodore's manner, and &s;everal little circum&s;tances which &s;eemed to indicate that his heart was not unconcerned in the event. Again &s;he was inclined to doubt, whether he had not obtained her con&s;ent to this meeting upon &s;ome groundle&s;s &s;u&s;picion; and &s;he almo&s;t determined not to go: yet it was po&s;&s;ible Theodore's a&s;&s;er|tion might be &s;incere, and her danger real; the chance of this made her delicate &s;cruples appear ridiculous; &s;he wondered that &s;he had for a moment &s;uffered them to weigh again&s;t &s;o &s;erious an intere&s;t, and, blaming her&s;elf for the delay they had occa&s;ioned, ha&s;tened to the place of appointment.</P>
<P>The little path, which led to this &s;pot, was &s;ilent and &s;olitary, and when &s;he reached the
<PB N="179" REF="181">
rece&s;s, Theodore had not arrived. A tran&s;ien pride made her unwilling he &s;hould find that &s;he was more punctual to his appointment than him&s;elf; and &s;he turned from the rece&s;s into a track, which wound among the trees to the right. Having walked &s;ome way, without &s;eeing any per&s;on, or hearing a foot&s;tep, &s;he returned; but he was not come, and &s;he again left the place. A &s;econd time &s;he came back, and Theodore was &s;till ab&s;ent. Recollecting the time at which &s;he had quitted the abbey, &s;he grew unea&s;y, and calculated that the hour appointed was now much exceeded. She was offended and perplexed; but &s;he &s;eated her&s;elf on the turf, and was re&s;olved to wait the event. After remaining here till the fall of twilight in fruitle&s;s expectation, her pride became more alarmed; &s;he feared that he had di&s;covered &s;omething of the partiality he had in&s;pired, and believing that he now treated her with pur|po&s;ed neglect, &s;he quitted the place with di&s;gu&s;t and &s;elf-accu&s;ation.</P>
<P>When the&s;e emotions &s;ub&s;ided, and rea&s;on re&s;umed its influence, &s;he blu&s;hed for what &s;he termed this childi&s;h efferve&s;cence of &s;elf-love. She recollected, as if for the fir&s;t time, the&s;e words of Theodore: <Q REND="inline">"I fear you are deceived, and that &s;ome danger is near you."</Q> Her judgment now acquitted the offender, and &s;he &s;aw only the friend. The import of the&s;e words, who&s;e truth &s;he no longer doubted,
<PB N="180" REF="182">
again alarmed her. Why did he trouble him|&s;elf to come from the chateau, on purpo&s;e to hint her danger, if he did not wi&s;h to pre&s;erve her? And if he wi&s;hed to pre&s;erve her, what but nece&s;&s;ity could have withheld him from the appointment?</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections decided her at once. She re&s;olved to repair on the following day at the &s;ame hour to the rece&s;s, whither the intere&s;t, which &s;he believed him to take in her fate, would no doubt conduct him in the hope of meeting her. That &s;ome evil hovered over her &s;he could not di&s;believe, but what it might be, &s;he was unable to gue&s;s. Mon&s;ieur and Ma|dame La Motte were her friends, and who el&s;e, removed, as &s;he now thought her&s;elf, beyond the reach of her father, could injure her? But why did Theodore &s;ay &s;he was deceived? She found it impo&s;&s;ible to extricate her&s;elf from the labyrinth of conjecture, but endeavoured to command her anxiety till the following evening. In the mean time &s;he engaged her&s;elf in efforts to amu&s;e Madame La Motte, who required &s;ome relief, after the departure of her &s;on.</P>
<P>Thus oppre&s;&s;ed by her own cares and inte|re&s;ted by tho&s;e of Madame La Motte, Adeline retired to re&s;t. She &s;oon lo&s;t her recollection, but it was only to fall into harra&s;&s;ed &s;lumbers, &s;uch as but too often haunt the couch of the unhappy. At length her perturbed fancy &s;ug|ge&s;ted the following dream.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="183">
She thought &s;he was in a large old chamber belonging to the abbey, more ancient and de|&s;olate, though in part furni&s;hed, than any &s;he had yet &s;een. It was &s;trongly barricadoed, yet no per&s;on appeared. While &s;he &s;tood mu&s;ing and &s;urveying the apartment, &s;he heard a low voice call her, and, looking towards the place from whence it came, &s;he perceived by the dim light of a lamp a figure &s;tretched on a bed that lay on the floor. The voice called again, and, approaching the bed, &s;he di&s;tinctly &s;aw the features of a man who appeared to be dying. A gha&s;tly palene&s;s over&s;pread his countenance, yet there was an expre&s;&s;ion of mildne&s;s and dignity in it, which &s;trongly intere&s;ted her.</P>
<P>While &s;he looked on him, his features changed and &s;eemed convul&s;ed in the agonies of death. The &s;pectacle &s;hocked her, and &s;he &s;tarted back, but he &s;uddenly &s;tretched forth his hand, and &s;eizing her's, gra&s;ped it with violence: &s;he &s;truggled in terror to di&s;engage her&s;elf, and again looking on his face, &s;aw a man, who appeared to be about thirty, with the &s;ame features, but in full health, and of a mo&s;t benign countenance. He &s;miled tenderly upon her and moved his lips, as if to &s;peak, when the floor of the chamber &s;uddenly opened and he &s;unk from her view. The effort &s;he made to &s;ave her&s;elf from following awoke her.&mdash;This dream had &s;o &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed her fancy, that it was &s;ome time before &s;he could overcome the
<PB N="182" REF="184">
error it occa&s;ioned, or even be perfectly con|vinced &s;he was in her own apartment. At length, however, &s;he compo&s;ed her&s;elf to &s;leep; again &s;he fell into a dream.</P>
<P>She thought &s;he was bewildered in &s;ome winding pa&s;&s;ages of the abbey; that it was almo&s;t dark, and that &s;he wandered about a con&s;i|derable time, without being able to find a door. Suddenly &s;he heard a bell toll from above, and &s;oon after a confu&s;ion of di&s;tant voices. She re|doubled her efforts to extricate her&s;elf. Pre|&s;ently all was &s;till, and, at length, wearied with the &s;earch, &s;he &s;at down on a &s;tep that cro&s;&s;ed the pa&s;&s;age. She had not been long here, when &s;he &s;aw a light glimmer at a di&s;tance on the walls, but a turn in the pa&s;&s;age, which was very long, prevented her &s;eeing from what it proceeded. It continued to glimmer faintly for &s;ome time and then grew &s;tronger, when &s;he &s;aw a man enter the pa&s;&s;age, habited in a long black cloak, like tho&s;e u&s;ually worn by attendants at funerals, and bearing a torch. He called to her to follow him, and led her through a long pa&s;&s;age to the foot of a &s;tairca&s;e. Here &s;he feared to proceed, and was running back, when the man &s;uddenly turned to pur&s;ue her, and with the terror, which this occa&s;ioned, &s;he awoke.</P>
<P>Shocked by the&s;e vi&s;ions, and more &s;o by their &s;eeming connection, which now &s;truck her, &s;he endeavoured to continue awake, le&s;t their terrific images &s;hould again haunt her
<PB N="183" REF="185">
mind: after &s;ome time, however, her harra&s;&s;ed &s;pirits again &s;unk into &s;lumber, though not to repo&s;e.</P>
<P>She now thought her&s;elf in a large old gallery, and &s;aw at one end of it a chamber door &s;tand|ing a little open and a light within: &s;he went towards it, and perceived the man &s;he had be|fore &s;een, &s;tanding at the door and beckoning her towards him. With the incon&s;i&s;tency &s;o common in dreams, &s;he no longer endeavoured to avoid him, but advancing, followed him into a &s;uite of very ancient apartments, hung with black, and lighted up as if for a funeral. Still he led her on, till &s;he found her&s;elf in the &s;ame chamber &s;he remembered to have &s;een in her former dream: a coffin, covered with a pall, &s;tood at the farther end of the room; &s;ome lights, and &s;everal per&s;ons &s;urrounded it, who appeared to be in great di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Suddenly, &s;he thought the&s;e per&s;ons were all gone, and that &s;he was left alone; that &s;he went up to the coffin, and while &s;he gazed upon it, &s;he heard a voice &s;peak, as if from within, but &s;aw nobody. The man &s;he had before &s;een, &s;oon after &s;tood by the coffin, and, lifting the pall, &s;he &s;aw beneath it a dead per&s;on, whom &s;he thought to be the dying Chevalier &s;he had &s;een in her former dream: his features were &s;unk in death, but they were yet &s;erene. While &s;he looked at him, a &s;tream of blood gu&s;hed from his &s;ide, and de&s;cending to the floor, the
<PB N="184" REF="186">
whole chamber was overflowed; at the &s;ame time &s;ome words were uttered in the voice &s;he heard before; but the horror of the &s;cene &s;o entirely overcame her, that &s;he &s;tarted and awoke.</P>
<P>When &s;he had recovered her recollection, &s;he rai&s;ed her&s;elf in the bed, to be convinced it was a dream &s;he had witne&s;&s;ed, and the agitation of her &s;pirits was &s;o great, that &s;he feared to be alone, and almo&s;t determined to call Annette. The features of the decea&s;ed per&s;on, and the chamber where he lay, were &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed upon her memory, and &s;he &s;till thought &s;he heard the voice and &s;aw the countenance which her dream repre&s;ented. The longer &s;he con|&s;idered the&s;e dreams, the more &s;he was &s;ur|prized: they were &s;o very terrible, returned &s;o often, and &s;eemed to be &s;o connected with each other, that &s;he could &s;carcely think them acci|dental; yet, why they &s;hould be &s;upernatural, &s;he could not tell. She &s;lept no more that night.</P>

<P>WHEN Adeline appeared at breakfa&s;t, her harra&s;&s;ed and languid countenance &s;truck Ma|dame La Motte, who inquired if &s;he was ill; Adeline, forcing a &s;mile upon her features, &s;aid &s;he had not re&s;ted well, for that &s;he had had very di&s;turbed dreams: &s;he was about to de|&s;cribe them, but a &s;trong and involuntary im|pul&s;e prevented her. At the &s;ame time, La Motte ridiculed her concern &s;o unmercifully, that &s;he was almo&s;t a&s;hamed to have mentioned it, and tried to overcome the remembrance of its cau&s;e.</P>
<P>After breakfa&s;t, &s;he endeavoured to employ her thoughts by conver&s;ing with Madame La Motte; but they were really engaged by the incidents of the la&s;t two days; the circum&s;tance of her dreams, and her conjectures concerning the information to be communicated to her by Theodore. They had thus &s;at for &s;ome time,
<PB N="186" REF="188">
when a &s;ound of voices aro&s;e from the great gate of the abbey; and, on going to the ca&s;ement, Adeline &s;aw the Marquis and his attendants on the lawn below. The portal of the abbey con|cealed &s;everal people from her view, and among the&s;e it was po&s;&s;ible might be Theodore, who had not yet appeared: &s;he continued to look for him with great anxiety, till the Marquis entered the hall with La Motte, and &s;ome other per&s;ons, &s;oon after which Madame went to receive him, and Adeline retired to her own apartment.</P>
<P>A me&s;&s;age from La Motte, however, &s;oon called her to join the party, where &s;he vainly hoped to find Theodore. The Marquis aro&s;e as &s;he approached, and, having paid her &s;ome ge|neral compliments, the conver&s;ation took a very lively turn. Adeline, finding it impo&s;&s;ible to counterfeit cheerfulne&s;s, while her heart was &s;inking with anxiety and di&s;appointment, took little part in it: Theodore was not once named. She would have a&s;ked concerning him, had it been po&s;&s;ible to inquire with propriety; but &s;he was obliged to content her&s;elf with hoping, fir&s;t, that he would arrive before dinner, and then be|fore the departure of the Marquis.</P>
<P>Thus the day pa&s;&s;ed in expectation and di&s;ap|pointment. The evening was now approaching, and &s;he was condemned to remain in the pre&s;ence of the Marquis, apparently li&s;tening to a con|ver&s;ation, which, in truth, &s;he &s;carcely heard, while the opportunity was, perhaps, e&s;caping
<PB N="187" REF="189">
that would decide her fate. She was &s;uddenly relieved from this &s;tate of torture, and thrown into one, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>The Marquis inquired for Louis, and being informed of his departure, mentioned that The|odore Peyrou had that morning &s;at out for his regiment in a di&s;tant province. He lamented the lo&s;s he &s;hould &s;u&s;tain by his ab&s;ence; and ex|pre&s;&s;ed &s;ome very flattering prai&s;e of his talents. The &s;hock of this intelligence overpowered the long-agitated &s;pirits of Adeline; the blood for|&s;ook her cheeks, and a &s;udden faintne&s;s came over her, from which &s;he recovered only to a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having di&s;covered her emotion, and the danger of relap&s;ing into a &s;econd fit.</P>
<P>She retired to her chamber, where, being once more alone, her oppre&s;&s;ed heart found re|lief from tears, in which &s;he freely indulged. Ideas crowded &s;o fa&s;t upon her mind, that it was long ere &s;he could arrange them &s;o as to produce any thing like rea&s;oning. She endeavoured to account for the abrupt departure of Theodore. <Q REND="inline">"Is it po&s;&s;ible,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"that he &s;hould take an intere&s;t in my welfare, and yet leave me expo&s;ed to the full force of a danger, which he him&s;elf fore&s;aw? Or am I to believe that he has trifled with my &s;implicity for an idle and has now left me to the wondering apprehen&s;ion he has rai&s;ed? Impo&s;&s;ible! a countenance no noble, and a manner &s;o amia|ble, could never di&s;gui&s;e a heart capable of
<PB N="188" REF="190">
forming &s;o de&s;picable a de&s;ign. No!&mdash;whatever is re&s;erved for me, let me not relin|qui&s;h the plea&s;ure of believing that he is wor|thy of my e&s;teem."</Q></P>
<P>She was awakened from thoughts like the&s;e by a peal of di&s;tant thunder, and now perceived that the gloomine&s;s of evening was deepened by the coming &s;torm; it rolled onward, and &s;oon af|ter the lightning began to fla&s;h along the cham|ber. Adeline was &s;uperior to the affectation of fear, and was not apt to be terrified; but &s;he now felt it unplea&s;ant to be alone, and, hoping that the Marquis might have left the abbey, &s;he went down to the &s;itting room; but the threaten|ing a&s;pect of the Heavens had hitherto detained him, and now the evening tempe&s;t made him re|joice that he had not quitted a &s;helter. The &s;torm continued, and night came on. La Motte pre&s;|&s;ed his gue&s;t to take a bed at the abbey, and he, at length con&s;ented; a circum&s;tance which threw Madame La Motte into &s;ome perplexity, as to the accommodation to be afforded him; after &s;ome time, &s;he arranged the affair to her &s;atis|faction: re&s;igning her own apartment to the Marquis, and that of Louis to two of his &s;uperior attendants; Adeline, it was farther &s;ettled, &s;hould give up her room to Mon&s;ieur and Ma|dame La Motte, and remove to an inner cham|ber, where a &s;mall bed, u&s;ually occupied by Annette, was placed for her.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="191">
At &s;upper the Marquis was le&s;s gay than u&s;ual; he frequently addre&s;&s;ed Adeline, and his look and manner &s;eemed to expre&s;s the tender intere&s;t, which her indi&s;po&s;ition, for &s;he &s;till appeared pale and languid, had excited. Adeline, as u&s;ual, made an effort to forget her anxiety, and appear happy; but the veil of a&s;&s;umed cheerful|ne&s;s was too thin to conceal the features of &s;or|row; and her feeble &s;miles only added a peculiar &s;oftne&s;s to her air. The Marquis conver&s;ed with her on a variety of &s;ubjects, and di&s;played an elegant mind. The ob&s;ervations of Adeline, which, when called upon, &s;he gave with reluc|tant mode&s;ty, in words at once &s;imple and force|ful, &s;eemed to excite his admiration, which he &s;ometimes betrayed by an inadvertent expre&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Adeline retired early to her room, which ad|joined on one &s;ide to Madame La Motte's, and on the other to the clo&s;et formerly mentioned. It was &s;pacious and lofty, and what little furniture it contained was falling to decay; but, perhaps, the pre&s;ent tone of her &s;pirits might contribute more than the&s;e circum&s;tances to give that air of melancholy, which &s;eemed to reign in it. She was unwilling to go to bed, le&s;t the dreams that had lately pur&s;ued her &s;hould return; and de|termined to &s;it up till &s;he found her&s;elf op|pre&s;&s;ed by &s;leep, when it was probable her re&s;t would be profound. She placed the light on a &s;mall table, and, taking a book, continued to
<PB N="190" REF="192">
read for above an hour, till her mind refu&s;ed any longer to ab&s;tract it&s;elf from its own cares, and &s;he &s;at for &s;ome time leaning pen&s;ively on her arm.</P>
<P>The wind was high, and as it whi&s;tled through the de&s;olate apartment, and &s;hook the feeble doors, &s;he often &s;tarted, and &s;ometimes even thought &s;he heard &s;ighs between the pau&s;es of the gu&s;t; but &s;he checked the&s;e illu&s;ions, which the hour of the night and her own melancholy imagi|nation con&s;pired to rai&s;e. As &s;he &s;at mu&s;ing, her eyes fixed on the oppo&s;ite wall, &s;he perceived the ar|ras, with which the room was hung, wave backwards and forwards; &s;he continued to ob|&s;erve it for &s;ome minutes, and then ro&s;e to ex|amine it farther. It was moved by the wind; and &s;he blu&s;hed at the momentary fear it had excited: but &s;he ob&s;erved that the tape&s;try was more &s;trongly agitated in one particular place than el&s;ewhere, and a noi&s;e that &s;eemed &s;ome|thing more than that of the wind i&s;&s;ued thence. The old bed&s;tead, which La Motte had found in this apartment, had been removed to accom|modate Adeline, and it was behind the place where this had &s;tood, that the wind &s;eemed to ru&s;h with particular force; curio&s;ity prompted her to examine &s;till farther; &s;he felt about the tape&s;try, and perceiving the wall behind &s;hake under her hand, &s;he lifted the arras, and di&s;|covered a &s;mall door, who&s;e loo&s;ened hinges ad|mitted
<PB N="191" REF="193">
the wind, and occa&s;ioned the noi&s;e &s;he had heard.</P>
<P>The door was held only by a bolt, having undrawn which, and brought the light, &s;he de&s;cended by a few &s;teps into another chamber: &s;he in&s;tantly remembered her dreams. The chamber was not much like that in which &s;he had &s;een the dying Chevalier, and afterwards the bier; but it gave her a confu&s;ed remem|brance of one through which &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed. Holding up the light to examine it more fully, &s;he was convinced by its &s;tructure that it was part of the ancient foundation. A &s;hattered ca&s;ement, placed high from the floor, &s;eemed to be the only opening to admit light. She ob&s;erved a door on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the apartment; and after &s;ome moments of he&s;ita|tion, gained courage, and determined to pur&s;ue the inquiry. <Q REND="inline">"A my&s;tery &s;eems to hang over the&s;e chambers,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"which it is, perhaps, my lot to develope; I will, at lea&s;t, &s;ee to what that door leads."</Q></P>
<P>She &s;tepped forward, and having unclo&s;ed it, proceeded with faltering &s;teps along a &s;uite of apartments, re&s;embling the fir&s;t in &s;tyle and condition, and terminating in one exactly like that where her dream had repre&s;ented the dying per&s;on; the remembrance &s;truck &s;o forcibly upon her imagination, that &s;he was in danger of fainting; and looking round the room,
<PB N="192" REF="194">
almo&s;t expected to &s;ee the phantom of her dream.</P>
<P>Unable to quit the place, &s;he &s;at down on &s;ome old lumber to recover her&s;elf, while her &s;pirits were nearly overcome by a &s;uper&s;titious dread, &s;uch as &s;he had never felt before. She wondered to what part of the abbey the&s;e cham|bers belonged, and that they had &s;o long e&s;caped detection. The ca&s;ements were all too high to afford any information from without. When &s;he was &s;ufficiently compo&s;ed to con&s;ider the direction of the rooms, and the &s;ituation of the abbey, there appeared not a doubt that they formed an interior part of the original building.</P>
<P>As the&s;e reflections pa&s;&s;ed over her mind, a &s;udden gleam of moonlight fell upon &s;ome ob|ject without the ca&s;ement. Being now &s;uf|ficiently compo&s;ed to wi&s;h to pur&s;ue the inqui|ry; and believing this object might afford her &s;ome means of learning the &s;ituation of the&s;e rooms, &s;he combated her remaining terrors, and, in order to di&s;tingui&s;h it more clearly, re|moved the light to an outer chamber; but be|fore &s;he could return, a heavy cloud was driven over the face of the moon, and all without was perfectly dark: &s;he &s;tood for &s;ome moments wai ing a returning gleam, but the ob&s;curity continued. As &s;he went &s;oftly back for the light, her foot &s;tumbled over &s;omething on the floor, and while &s;he &s;tooped to examine it, the moon again &s;hone, &s;o that &s;he could di&s;tingui&s;h,
<PB N="193" REF="195">
through the ca&s;ement, the ea&s;tern towers of the abbey. This di&s;covery confirmed her former conjectures concerning the interior &s;ituation of the&s;e apartments. The ob&s;curity of the place prevented her di&s;covering what it was that had impeded her &s;teps, but having brought the light forward, &s;he perceived on the floor an old dag|ger: with a trembling hand &s;he took it up, and upon a clo&s;er view perceived, that it was &s;pot|ted and &s;tained with ru&s;t.</P>
<P>Shocked and &s;urpri&s;ed, &s;he looked round the room for &s;ome object that might confirm or de&s;troy the dreadful &s;u&s;picion which now ru&s;hed upon her mind; but &s;he &s;aw only a great chair, with broken arms, that &s;tood in one corner of the room, and a table in a condition equally &s;hattered, except that in another part lay a confu&s;ed heap of things, which appeared to be old lumber. She went up to it, and perceived a broken bed&s;tead, with &s;ome decayed remnants of furniture, covered with du&s;t and cobwebs, and which &s;eemed, indeed, as if they had not been moved for many years. De&s;irous, howe|ver, of examining farther, &s;he attempted to rai&s;e what appeared to have been part of the bed&s;tead, but it &s;lipped from her hand, and, rolling to the floor, brought with it &s;ome of the remaining lumber. Adeline &s;tarted a&s;ide and &s;aved her&s;elf, and when the noi&s;e it made had cea&s;ed, &s;he heard a &s;mall ru&s;tling &s;ound, and as
<PB N="194" REF="196">
&s;he was about to leave the chamber, &s;aw &s;ome|thing falling gently among the lumber.</P>
<P>It was a &s;mall roll of paper, tied with a &s;tring, and covered with du&s;t. Adeline took it up, and on opening it perceived an handwriting. She attempted to read it, but the part of the manu&s;cript &s;he looked at was &s;o much obliterated, that &s;he found this difficult, though what few words were legible impre&s;&s;ed her with curio&s;ity and terror, and induced her to return with it immediately to her chamber.</P>
<P>Having reached her own room, &s;he fa&s;tened the private door, and let the arras fall over it as before. It was now midnight. The &s;tillne&s;s of the hour, interrupted only at intervals by the hollow &s;ighings of the bla&s;t, heightened the &s;o|lemnity of Adeline's feelings She wi&s;hed &s;he was not alone, and before &s;he proceeded to look into the manu&s;cript, li&s;tened whether Madame La Motte was yet in her chamber: not the lea&s;t &s;ound was heard, and &s;he gently opened the door. The profound &s;ilence within almo&s;t con|vinced her that no per&s;on was there; but willing to be farther &s;atisfied, &s;he brought the light and found the room empty. The latene&s;s of the hour made her wonder that Madame La Motte was not in her chamber, and &s;he pro|ceeded to the top of the tower &s;tairs, to hearken if any per&s;on was &s;tirring.</P>
<P>She heard the &s;ound of voices from below, and, among&s;t the re&s;t, that of La Motte
<PB N="195" REF="197">
&s;peaking in his u&s;ual tone. Being now &s;atis|fied that all was well, &s;he turned towards her room, when &s;he heard the Marquis pronounce her name with very unu&s;ual empha&s;is. She pau&s;ed. <Q REND="inline">"I adore her,"</Q> pur&s;ued he, <Q REND="inline">"and by heaven"&mdash;</Q>He was interrupted by La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"My Lord, remember your promi&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I do,"</Q> replied the Marquis, <Q REND="inline">"and I will abide by it. But we trifle. To-morrow I will declare my&s;elf, and I &s;hall then know both what to hope and how to act."</Q> Adeline trembled &s;o exce&s;&s;ively, that &s;he could &s;carcely &s;upport her&s;elf: &s;he wi&s;hed to return to her chamber; yet &s;he was too much intere&s;ted in the words &s;he had heard, not to be anxious to have them more fully explained. There was an interval of &s;ilence, after which they con|ver&s;ed in a lower tone. Adeline remembered the hints of Theodore, and determined, if po&s;|&s;ible, to be relieved from the terrible &s;u&s;pen&s;e &s;he now &s;uffered. She &s;tole &s;oftly down a few &s;teps, that &s;he might catch the accents of the &s;peakers, but they were &s;o low, that &s;he could only now and then di&s;tingui&s;h a few words. <Q REND="inline">"Her father, &s;ay you?"</Q> &s;aid the Marquis. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, my Lord, her father. I am well in|formed of what I &s;ay."</Q> Adeline &s;huddered at the mention of her father, a new terror &s;eized her, and with increa&s;ing eagerne&s;s &s;he endeavoured to di&s;tingui&s;h their words, but for &s;ome time found this to be impo&s;&s;ible. <Q REND="inline">"Here
<PB N="196" REF="198">
is no time to be lo&s;t,"</Q> &s;aid the Marquis, <Q REND="inline">"to-morrow then."&mdash;</Q>She heard La Motte ri&s;e, and, believing it was to leave the room, &s;he hurried up the &s;teps, and having reached her chamber, &s;unk almo&s;t lifele&s;s in a chair.</P>
<P>It was her father only of whom &s;he thought. She doubted not that he had pur&s;ued and di&s;|covered her retreat, and, though this conduct appeared very incon&s;i&s;tent with his former be|haviour in abandoning her to &s;trangers, her fears &s;ugge&s;ted that it would terminate in &s;ome new cruelty. She did not he&s;itate to pronounce this the danger of which Theodore had warned her; but it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;urmi&s;e how he had gained his knowledge of it, or how he had become &s;ufficiently acquainted with her &s;tory, except through La Motte, her apparent friend and protector, whom &s;he was thus, though un|willingly, led to &s;u&s;pect of treachery. Why, indeed, &s;hould La Motte conceal from her only his knowledge of her father's intention, unle&s;s he de&s;igned to deliver her into his hands? Yet it was long ere &s;he could bring her&s;elf to be|lieve this conclu&s;ion po&s;&s;ible. To di&s;cover de|pravity in tho&s;e whom we have loved, is one of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite tortures to a virtuous mind, and the conviction is often rejected before it is finally admitted.</P>
<P>The words of Theodore, which told her he was fearful &s;he was deceived, confirmed this mo&s;t painful apprehen&s;ion of La Motte, with
<PB N="197" REF="199">
another yet more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, that Madame La Motte was al&s;o united again&s;t her. This thought, for a moment, &s;ubdued terror and left her only grief; &s;he wept bitterly. <Q REND="inline">"Is this human nature?"</Q> cried &s;he. <Q REND="inline">"Am I doomed to find every body deceitful?"</Q> An unexpected di&s;covery of vice in tho&s;e, whom we have ad|mired, inclines us to extend our cen&s;ure of the individual to the &s;pecies; we henceforth contemn appearances, and too ha&s;tily conclude that no per&s;on is to be tru&s;ted.</P>
<P>Adeline determined to throw her&s;elf at the feet of La Motte, on the following morning, and implore his pity and protection. Her mind was now too much agitated, by her own inte|re&s;ts, to permit her to examine the manu&s;cripts, and &s;he &s;at mu&s;ing in her chair, till &s;he heard the &s;teps of Madame La Motte, when &s;he re|tired to bed. La Motte &s;oon after came up to his chamber, and Adeline, the mild, per&s;ecuted Adeline, who had now pa&s;&s;ed two days of tor|turing anxiety, and one night of terrific vi&s;ions, endeavoured to compo&s;e her mind to &s;leep. In the pre&s;ent &s;tate of her &s;pirits, &s;he quickly caught alarm, and &s;he had &s;carcely fallen into a &s;lumber, when &s;he was rou&s;ed by a loud and uncommon noi&s;e. She li&s;tened, and thought the &s;ound came from the apartments below, but in a few minutes there was a ha&s;ty knocking at the door of La Motte's chamber.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="200">
La Motte, who had ju&s;t fallen a&s;leep, was not ea&s;ily to be rou&s;ed, but the knocking in|crea&s;ed with &s;uch violence, that Adeline, ex|tremely terrified, aro&s;e and went to the door that opened from her chamber into his, with a de&s;ign to call him. She was &s;topped by the voice of the Marquis, which &s;he now clearly di&s;tingui&s;hed at the door. He called to La Motte to ri&s;e immediately, and Madame La Motte endeavoured at the &s;ame time to rou&s;e her hu&s;band, who, at length awoke in much alarm, and &s;oon after, joining the Marquis, they went down &s;tairs together. Adeline now dre&s;&s;ed her|&s;elf, as well as her trembling hands would per|mit, and went into the adjoining chamber, where &s;he found Madame La Motte extremely &s;urprized and terrified.</P>
<P>The Marquis, in the mean time, told La Motte, with great agitation, that he recollected having appointed &s;ome per&s;ons to meet him upon bu&s;ine&s;s of importance, early in the morning, and it was, therefore, nece&s;&s;ary for him to &s;et off for his chateau immediately. As he &s;aid this, and de&s;ired that his &s;ervants might be called, La Motte could not help ob&s;erving the a&s;hy palene&s;s of his countenance, or expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome appre|hen&s;ion that his Lord&s;hip was ill. The Mar|quis a&s;&s;ured him he was perfectly well, but de|&s;ired that he might &s;et out immediately. Peter was now ordered to call the other &s;ervants, and the Marquis, having refu&s;ed to take any refre&s;h|ment,
<PB N="199" REF="201">
bade La Motte a ha&s;ty adieu, and, as &s;oon as his people were ready, left the abbey.</P>
<P>La Motte returned to his chamber, mu&s;ing on the abrupt departure of his gue&s;t, who&s;e emotion appeared much too &s;trong to proceed from the cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned. He appea&s;ed the anxiety of Ma|dame La Motte, and at the &s;ame time excited her &s;urprize by acquainting her with the occa|&s;ion of the late di&s;turbance. Adeline, who had retired from the chamber, on the approach of La Motte, looked out from her window on hearing the trampling of hor&s;es. It was the Marquis and his people, who ju&s;t then pa&s;&s;ed at a little di&s;tance. Unable to di&s;tingui&s;h who the per&s;ons were, &s;he was alarmed at ob&s;erving &s;uch a party about the abbey at that hour, and, cal|ling to inform La Motte of the circum&s;tance, was made acquainted with what had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>At length &s;he retired to her bed, and her &s;lumbers were this night undi&s;turbed by dreams.</P>
<P>When &s;he aro&s;e in the morning, &s;he ob&s;erved La Motte walking alone in the avenue below, and &s;he ha&s;tened to &s;eize the opportunity which now offered of pleading her cau&s;e. She ap|proached him with faltering &s;teps, while the palene&s;s and timidity of her countenance di&s;cov|ered the di&s;order of her mind. Her fir&s;t words, without entering upon any explanation, implo|red his compa&s;&s;ion. La Motte &s;topped, and, looking earne&s;tly in her face, inquired whether any part of his conduct towards her merited the
<PB N="200" REF="202">
&s;u&s;picion which her reque&s;t implied. Adeline for a moment blu&s;hed that &s;he had doubted his integrity, but the words &s;he had overheard re|turned to her memory.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your behaviour, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I ac|knowledge to have been kind and generous, beyond what I had a right to expect, but"&mdash;</Q>and &s;he pau&s;ed. She knew not how to mention what &s;he blu&s;hed to believe. La Motte conti|nued to gaze on her in &s;ilent expectation, and at length de&s;ired her to proceed and explain her meaning. She entreated that he would protect her from her father. La Motte looked &s;urpri&s;ed and confu&s;ed. <Q REND="inline">"Your father!"</Q> &s;aid he. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir,"</Q> replied Adeline; <Q REND="inline">"I am not ignorant that he has di&s;covered my retreat. I have every thing to dread from a parent, who has treated me with &s;uch cruelty as you was wit|ne&s;s of; and I again implore that you will &s;ave me from his hands."</Q></P>
<P>La Motte &s;tood fixed in thought, and Adeline continued her endeavours to intere&s;t his pity. <Q REND="inline">"What rea&s;on have you to &s;uppo&s;e, or, ra|ther, how have you learned, that your father pur&s;ues you?"</Q> The que&s;tion confu&s;ed Ade|line, who blu&s;hed to acknowledge that &s;he had overheard his di&s;cour&s;e, and di&s;dained to invent, or utter a fal&s;ity: at length &s;he confe&s;&s;ed the truth. The countenance of La Motte in&s;tantly changed to a &s;avage fiercene&s;s, and, &s;harply re|buking her for a conduct, to which &s;he had been
<PB N="201" REF="203">
rather tempted by chance, than prompted by de|&s;ign, he inquired what &s;he had overheard, that could &s;o much alarm her. She faithfully repea|ted the &s;ub&s;tance of the incoherent &s;entences that had met her ear; while &s;he &s;poke, he regarded her with a fixed attention. <Q REND="inline">"And was this all you heard? Is it from the&s;e few words that you draw &s;uch a po&s;itive conclu&s;ion? Exa|mine them, and you will find they do not ju&s;tify it."</Q></P>
<P>She now perceived, what the fervor of her her fears had not permitted her to ob&s;erve before, that the words, unconnectedly as &s;he heard them, imported little, and that her imagination had fil|led up the void in the &s;entences, &s;o as to &s;ugge&s;t the evil apprehended. Notwith&s;tanding this, her fears were little abated. <Q REND="inline">"Your apprehen&s;ions are, doubtle&s;s, now removed,"</Q> re&s;umed La Motte; <Q REND="inline">"but to give you a proof of the &s;ince|rity which you have ventured to que&s;tion, I will tell you they were ju&s;t. You &s;eem alar|med, and with rea&s;on. Your father has di&s;|covered your re&s;idence, and has already de|manded you. It is true, that from a motive of compa&s;&s;ion I have refu&s;ed to re&s;ign you, but I have neither authority to withhold, or means to defend you. When he comes to en|force his demand, you will perceive this. Prepare your&s;elf, therefore, for the evil, which you &s;ee is inevitable."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="204">
Adeline, for &s;ome time, could &s;peak only by her tears. At length, with a fortitude which de&s;pair had rou&s;ed, &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I re&s;ign my&s;elf to the will of Heaven!"</Q> La Motte gazed on her in &s;ilence, and a &s;trong emotion appeared in his countenance, He forbore, however, to re|new the di&s;cour&s;e, and withdrew to the abbey, leaving Adeline in the avenue, ab&s;orbed in grief.</P>
<P>A &s;ummons to breakfa&s;t ha&s;tened her to the parlour, where &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the morning in con|ver&s;ation with Madame La Motte, to whom &s;he told all her apprehen&s;ions, and expre&s;&s;ed all her &s;orrow. Pity and &s;uperficial con&s;olation was all that Madame La Motte could offer, though apparently much affected by Adeline's di&s;cour&s;e. Thus the hours pa&s;&s;ed heavily away, while the anxiety of Adeline continued to increa&s;e, and the moment of her fate &s;eemed fa&s;t approaching. Dinner was &s;carcely over, when Adeline was &s;urprized to &s;ee the Marquis arrive. He en|tered the room with his u&s;ual ea&s;e, and, apo|logizing for the di&s;turbance he had occa&s;ioned on the preceding night, repeated what he had before told La Motte.</P>
<P>The remembrance of the conver&s;ation &s;he had overheard, at fir&s;t gave Adeline &s;ome confu&s;ion, and withdrew her mind from a &s;en&s;e of the evils to be apprehended from her father. The Marquis, who, was, as u&s;ual, attentive to Adeline, &s;eemed affected by her
<PB N="203" REF="205">
apparent indi&s;po&s;ition, and expre&s;&s;ed much concern for that dejection of &s;pirits, which, notwith&s;tanding every effort, her manner be|trayed. When Madame La Motte withdrew, Adeline would have followed her, but the Marquis entreated a few moment's attention, and led her back to her &s;eat. La Motte imme|diately di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>Adeline knew too well what would be the purport of the Marquis's di&s;cour&s;e, and his words &s;oon increa&s;ed the confu&s;ion which her fears had occa&s;ioned. While he was declaring the ardour of his pa&s;&s;ion in &s;uch terms, as but too often make vehemence pa&s;s for &s;incerity, Adeline, to whom this declaration, if honoura|ble, was di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, and if di&s;honourable, was &s;hocking, interrupted him and thanked him for the offer of a di&s;tinction, which, with a mode&s;t but determined air, &s;he &s;aid &s;he mu&s;t refu&s;e. She ro&s;e to withdraw. <Q REND="inline">"Stay, too lovely Ade|line!"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"and if compa&s;&s;ion for my &s;ufferings will not intere&s;t you in my favour, allow a con&s;ideration of your own dangers to do &s;o. Mon&s;ieur La Motte has informed me of your misfortunes, and of the evil that now threatens you; accept from me the protec|tion which he cannot afford"</Q></P>
<P>Adeline continued to move towards the door, when the Marquis threw him&s;elf at her feet, and, &s;eizing her hand, impre&s;&s;ed it with ki&s;&s;es. She &s;truggled to di&s;engage her&s;elf. <Q REND="inline">"Hear
<PB N="204" REF="206">
me, charming Adeline! hear me,"</Q> cried the Marquis; <Q REND="inline">"I exi&s;t but for you. Li&s;ten to my entreaties and my fortune &s;hall be yours. Do not drive me to de&s;pair by ill-judged ri|gour, or, becau&s;e"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My Lord,"</Q> interrupted Adeline, with an air of ineffable dignity, and &s;till affecting to believe his propo&s;al honourable, <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;en&s;ible of the genero&s;ity of your conduct, and al&s;o flattered by the di&s;tinction you offer me. I will, therefore, &s;ay &s;omething more than is nece&s;&s;ary to a bare expre&s;&s;ion of the denial which I mu&s;t continue to give. <HI>I can not</HI> be|&s;tow my heart. <HI>You can not</HI> obtain more than my e&s;teem, to which, indeed, nothing can &s;o much contribute as a forbearance from any &s;imilar offers in future."</Q></P>
<P>She again attempted to go, but the Marquis prevented her, and after &s;ome he&s;itation, again urged his &s;uit, though in terms that would no longer allow her to mi&s;under&s;tand him. Tears &s;welled into her eyes, but &s;he endeavoured to check them, and with a look, in which grief and indignation &s;eemed to &s;truggle for pre-emi|nence, &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"My Lord, this is unworthy of reply, let me pa&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>For a moment, he was awed by the dignity of her manner, and he threw him&s;elf at her feet to implore forgivene&s;s. But &s;he waved her hand in &s;ilence and hurried from the room. When &s;he reached her chamber, &s;he locked the door, and,
<PB N="205" REF="207">
&s;inking into a chair, yielded to the &s;orrow, that pre&s;&s;ed at her heart. And it was not the lea&s;t of her &s;orrow, to &s;u&s;pect that La Motte was un|worthy of her confidence; for it was almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible that he could be ignorant of the real de|&s;igns of the Marquis. Madame La Motte, &s;he believed, was impo&s;ed upon by a &s;pecious pre|tence of honourable attachment; and thus was &s;he &s;pared the pang which a doubt of her inte|grity would have added.</P>
<P>She threw a trembling glance upon the pro&s;|pect around her. On one &s;ide was her father, who&s;e cruelty had already been too plainly mani|fe&s;ted; and on the other, the Marquis pur&s;uing her with in&s;ult and vicious pa&s;&s;ion. She re&s;ol|ved to acquaint Madame La Motte with the purport of the late conver&s;ation, and, in the hope of her protection and &s;ympathy, &s;he wiped away her tears, and was leaving the room ju&s;t as Madame La Motte entered it. While Ade|line related what had pa&s;&s;ed, her friend wept, and appeared to &s;uffer great agitation. She en|deavoured to comfort her, and promi&s;ed to u&s;e her influence in per&s;uading La Motte to prohibit the addre&s;&s;es of the Marquis. <Q REND="inline">"You know, my dear,"</Q> added Madame, <Q REND="inline">"that our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances oblige us to pre&s;erve terms with the Marquis, and you will, therefore, &s;uffer as little re&s;entment to appear in your manner towards him as po&s;&s;ible; conduct your&s;elf with your u&s;ual ea&s;e in his pre&s;ence, and I

<P>She &s;oon after &s;aw the Marquis depart, and, as there now appeared to be no ob&s;tacle to the return of Madame La Motte, &s;he expected her with extreme impatience. After thus waiting near an hour in her chamber, &s;he was at length
<PB N="207" REF="209">
&s;ummoned to the parlour, and there found Mon&s;ieur La Motte alone. He aro&s;e upon her entrance, and for &s;ome minutes paced the room in &s;ilence.

<P>Adeline was &s;uprized and offended that La Motte &s;hould think &s;o lightly both of her under|&s;tanding and di&s;po&s;ition as his &s;peech implied. <Q REND="inline">"It is po&s;&s;ible, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"that you have been apprized of the Marquis's con|duct?"</Q></P>

He is now my friend, and it
<PB N="208" REF="210">
is nece&s;&s;ary to my &s;afety that he &s;hould con|tinue &s;uch; but if I &s;uffer any part of my family to treat him with rudene&s;s, I mu&s;t expect to &s;ee him my enemy. You may &s;urely treat him with complai&s;ance."</Q> Ade|line thought the term <HI>rudene&s;s</HI> a har&s;h one, as La Motte applied it, but &s;he forbore from any expre&s;&s;ion of di&s;plea&s;ure. <Q REND="inline">"I could have wi&s;h|ed, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"for the privilege of retiring whenever the Marquis appeared; but &s;ince you believe this conduct would af|fect your intere&s;t, I ought to &s;ubmit."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This prudence and good-will delight me,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"and &s;ince you wi&s;h to &s;erve me, know that you cannot more effectually do it, than by treating the Marquis as a friend."</Q> The word <HI>friend,</HI> as it &s;tood con|nected with the Marquis, &s;ounded di&s;&s;onantly to Adeline's ear; &s;he he&s;itated and looked at La Motte. <Q REND="inline">"As <HI>your</HI> friend, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"I will endeavour to"&mdash;</Q>treat him as mine, &s;he would have &s;aid, but &s;he found it impo&s;&s;ible to fini&s;h the &s;entence.

<P><Q REND="inline">"What protection I can afford is your's,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"but you know how de&s;titute I am both of the right and the means of re|&s;i&s;ting him, and al&s;o how much I require protection my&s;elf.

if I oppo&s;e him, he may betray me to the officers of the law, as the &s;ure&s;t method of obtaining po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of you. We are encom|pa&s;&s;ed with dangers,"</Q> continued La Motte; <Q REND="inline">"would I could &s;ee any method of extricating our&s;elves!"</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"Your plan is rea&s;onable,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"had I money to excu&s;e it.

Chiefly I mu&s;t endeavour to pre&s;erve the favour of the Marquis. He may do much, &s;hould your father even pur&s;ue de&s;perate mea&s;ures. But why do I talk thus? Your father may ere this have commenced the&s;e mea&s;ures, and the effects of his vengeance may now be hanging over my head. My regard for you, Adeline, has expo&s;ed me to this; had I re&s;igned you to his will, I &s;hould have remained &s;ecure."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline was &s;o much affected by this in&s;tance of La Motte's kindne&s;s, which &s;he could not
<PB N="210" REF="212">
doubt, that &s;he was unable to expre&s;s her &s;en&s;e of it. When &s;he could &s;peak, &s;he uttered her gratitude in the mo&s;t lively terms. <Q REND="inline">"Are you &s;incere in the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions?"</Q> &s;aid La Motte.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is it po&s;&s;ible I can be le&s;s than &s;incere?"</Q> replied Adeline, weeping at the idea of ingra|titude.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Sentiments are ea&s;ily pronounced,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"though they may have no connection with the heart; I believe them to be &s;incere &s;o far only as they influence our actions."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What mean you, Sir?"</Q> &s;aid Adeline with &s;urprize.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I mean to inquire, whether, if an oppor|tunity &s;hould ever offer of thus proving your gratitude, you would adhere to your &s;en|timents?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Name one that I &s;hall refu&s;e,"</Q> &s;aid Ade|line with energy.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If, for in&s;tance, the Marquis &s;hould here|after avow a &s;erious pa&s;&s;ion for you, and offer you his hand, would no petty re&s;ent|ment, no lurking prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for &s;ome more happy lover prompt you to refu&s;e it?"</Q></P>
<P>Adeline blu&s;hed and fixed her eyes on the ground. <Q REND="inline">"You have, indeed, Sir, named the only means I &s;hould reject of evincing my &s;incerity. The Marquis I can never love, nor, to &s;peak &s;incerely, ever e&s;teem. I con|fe&s;s the peace of one's whole life is too much to &s;acrifice even to gratitude."&mdash;</Q>La Motte

looked di&s;plea&s;ed. <Q REND="inline">"'Tis as I thought,"</Q> &s;aid he; <Q REND="inline">"the&s;e delicate &s;entiments make a fine appearance in &s;peech, and render the per&s;on who utters them infinitely amiable; but bring them to the te&s;t of action, and they di&s;&s;olve into air, leaving only the wreck of vanity behind."</Q></P>
<P>This unju&s;t &s;arca&s;m brought tears to her eyes. <Q REND="inline">"Since your &s;afety, Sir, depends upon my conduct,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"re&s;ign me to my father. I am willing to return to him, &s;ince my &s;tay here mu&s;t involve you in new mis|fortune.

When I am gone, you will have no rea&s;on to apprehend the Marquis's di&s;plea&s;ure, which you may probably incur if I &s;tay here: for I feel it impo&s;&s;ible that I could even con&s;ent to receive his addre&s;&s;es, however honourable were his views."</Q></P>
<P>La Motte &s;eemed hurt and alarmed. <Q REND="inline">"This mu&s;t not be,"</Q> &s;aid he; <Q REND="inline">"let us not harra&s;s our&s;elves by &s;tating <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> evils, and then, to avoid them, fly to tho&s;e which are <HI>certain.</HI> No, Adeline, though you are ready to &s;a|crifice your&s;elf to my &s;afety, I will not &s;uffer you to do &s;o.

I a&s;k, is a civil deportment towards the Marquis."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will endeavour to obey you, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline.&mdash;Madame La Motte now entered the room, and this conver&s;ation cea&s;ed.

<P>THE MS. found by Adeline, the preceding night, had &s;everal times occurred to her re|collection in the cour&s;e of the day, but &s;he had then been either too much intere&s;ted by the events of the moment, or too apprehen&s;ive of interruption, to attempt a peru&s;al of it. She
<PB N="213" REF="215">
now took it from the drawer in which it had been depo&s;ited, and, intending only to look cur|&s;orily over the few fir&s;t pages, &s;at down with it by her bed &s;ide.</P>
<P>She opened it with an eagerne&s;s of inquiry, which the di&s;coloured and almo&s;t obliterated ink but &s;lowly gratified. The fir&s;t words on the page were entirely lo&s;t, but tho&s;e that appeared to commence the narrative were as follows:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O! ye, whoever ye are, whom chance, or misfortune, may hereafter conduct to this &s;pot&mdash;to ye I &s;peak&mdash;to ye reveal the &s;tory of my wrongs, and a&s;k ye to avenge them. Vain hope! yet it imparts &s;ome comfort to believe it po&s;&s;ible that what I now write may one day meet the eye of a fellow-creature; that the words, which tell my &s;ufferings, may one day draw pity from the feeling heart.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yet &s;tay your tears&mdash;your pity now is u&s;ele&s;s: long &s;ince have the pangs of mi&s;ery cea&s;ed; the voice of complaining is pa&s;&s;ed away. It is weakne&s;s to wi&s;h for compa&s;&s;ion which cannot be felt till I &s;hall &s;ink in the repo&s;e of death, and ta&s;te, I hope, the hap|pine&s;s of eternity!</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Know then, that on the night of the twelfth of October, in the year 1642, I was arre&s;ted on the road to Caux, and on the very &s;pot where a column is erected to the memory of
<PB N="214" REF="216">
the immortal Henry, by four ruffians, who after di&s;abling my &s;ervant, bore me through wilds and woods to this abbey. Their de|meanour was not that of common banditti, and I &s;oon perceived they were employed by a &s;uperior power to perpetrate &s;ome dreadful purpo&s;e. Entreaties and bribes were vainly offered them to di&s;cover their employer and abandon their de&s;ign: they would not reveal even the lea&s;t circum&s;tance of their intenti|ons.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But when, after a long journey, they ar|rived at this edifice, their ba&s;e employer was at once revealed, and his horrid &s;cheme but too well under&s;tood. What a moment was that! All the thunders of Heaven &s;eemed launched at this defencele&s;s head! O fortitude! nerve my heart to"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>Adeline's light was now expiring in the &s;ocket, and the palene&s;s of the ink, &s;o feebly &s;hone upon, baffled her efforts to di&s;criminate the letters: it was impo&s;&s;ible to procure a light from below, without di&s;covering that &s;he was yet up; a circum&s;tance, which would excite &s;urprize and lead to explanations, &s;uch as &s;he did not wi&s;h to enter upon. Thus compelled to &s;u&s;pend the inquiry, which &s;o many atten|dant circum&s;tances had rendered awfully intere&s;|ting, &s;he retired to her humble bed.</P>
<P>What &s;he had read of the MS. awakened a dreadful intere&s;t in the fate of the writer, and
<PB N="215" REF="217">
called up terrific images to her mind. <Q REND="inline">"In the&s;e apartments!"&mdash;</Q>&s;aid &s;he, and &s;he &s;hud|dered and clo&s;ed her eyes. At length, &s;he heard Madame La Motte enter her chamber, and the phantoms of fear beginning to di&s;&s;i|pate, left her to repo&s;e.</P>
<P>In the morning, &s;he was awakened by Ma|dame La Motte, and found, to her di&s;appoint|ment, that &s;he had &s;lept &s;o much beyond her u&s;ual time, as to be unable to renew the peru&s;al of the MS.&mdash;La Motte appeared uncommonly gloomy, and Madame wore an air of melan|choly, which Adeline attributed to the concern &s;he felt for her. Breakfa&s;t was &s;carcely over, when the &s;ound of hor&s;es feet announced the ar|rival of a &s;tranger; and Adeline, from the oriel rece&s;s of the hall, &s;aw the Marquis alight. She retreated with precipitation, and, forgetting the reque&s;t of La Motte, was ha&s;tening to her chamber; but the Marquis was already in the hall, and &s;eeing her leaving it, turned to La Motte with a look of inquiry. La Motte called her back, and by a frown too intelligent, remin|ded her of her promi&s;e. She &s;ummoned all her &s;pi|rits to her aid, but advanced, notwith&s;tanding, in vi&s;ible emotion, while the Marquis addre&s;&s;ed her as u&s;ual, the &s;ame ea&s;y gaiety playing upon his countenance and directing his manner.</P>
<P>Adeline was &s;urprized and &s;hocked at this carele&s;s confidence which, however, by awaken|ing her pride, communicated to her an air of
<PB N="216" REF="218">
dignity that aba&s;hed him. He &s;poke with he&s;i|tation, and frequently appeared ab&s;tracted from the &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e. At length ari&s;ing, he begged Adeline would favour him with a few moments conver&s;ation. Mon&s;ieur and Madame La Motte were now leaving the room, when Adeline turning to the Marquis, told him, <Q REND="inline">"&s;he would not hear any conver&s;ation, except in the pre&s;ence of her friends."</Q> But &s;he &s;aid it in vain, for they were gone; and La Motte, as he withdrew, expre&s;&s;ed by his looks how much an attempt to follow would di&s;plea&s;e him.</P>
<P>She &s;at for &s;ome time in &s;ilence, and trem|bling expectation. <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;en&s;ible,"</Q> &s;aid the Marquis at length, <Q REND="inline">"that the conduct to which the ardour of my pa&s;&s;ion lately betrayed me, has injured me in your opinion, and that you will not ea&s;ily re&s;tore me to your e&s;teem; but, I tru&s;t, the offer which I now make you, both of my <HI>title</HI> and fortune, will &s;ufficiently prove the &s;incerity of my attachment, and atone for the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion which love only prompted."</Q></P>
<P>After this &s;pecimen of common place verbo|&s;ity, which the Marquis &s;eemed to con&s;ider as a prelude to triumph, he attempted to impre&s;s a ki&s;s upon the hand of Adeline, who, withdraw|ing it ha&s;tily, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"You are already, my Lord, acquainted with my &s;entiments upon this &s;ubject, and it is almo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary for
<PB N="217" REF="219">
me now to repeat, that I cannot accept the honour you offer me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Explain your&s;elf, lovely Adeline! I am ignorant that till now, I ever made you this offer."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mo&s;t true, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline, <Q REND="inline">"and you do well to remind me of this, &s;ince, after having heard your former propo&s;al, I can li&s;ten for a moment to any other."</Q> She ro&s;e to quit the room. <Q REND="inline">"Stay, Madam,"</Q> &s;aid the Mar|quis, with a look, in which offended pride &s;truggled to conceal it&s;elf; <Q REND="inline">"do not &s;uffer an extravagant re&s;entment to operate again&s;t your true inte|re&s;ts; recollect the dangers that &s;urround you, and con&s;ider the value of an offer, which may afford you at lea&s;t an honourable a&s;y|lum."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My misfortunes, my Lord, whatever they are, I have never obtruded upon you; you will, therefore, excu&s;e my ob&s;erving, that your pre&s;ent mention of them conveys a much grea|ter appearance of in&s;ult than compa&s;&s;ion."</Q> The Marquis, though with evident confu&s;ion, was going to reply; but Adeline would not be detained, and retired to her chamber. De&s;titute as &s;he was, her heart revolted from the propo|&s;al of the Marquis, and &s;he determined never to accept it. To her di&s;like of his general di&s;po&s;i|tion, and the aver&s;ion excited by his late offer, was added, indeed, the influence of a prior at|tachment,
<PB N="218" REF="220">
and of a remembrance, which &s;he found it impo&s;&s;ible to era&s;e from her heart.</P>
<P>The Marquis &s;tayed to dine, and, in con&s;i|deration of La Motte, Adeline appeared at ta|ble, where the former gazed upon her with &s;uch frequent and &s;ilent earne&s;tne&s;s, that her di&s;|tre&s;s became in&s;upportable, and when the cloth was drawn, &s;he in&s;tantly retired. Madame La Motte &s;oon followed, and it was not till evening that &s;he had an opportunity of returning to the MS. When Mon&s;ieur and Madame La Motte were in their chamber, and all was &s;till, &s;he drew forth the narrative, and, trimming her lamp, &s;at down to read as follows:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The ruffians unbound me from my hor&s;e, and led me through the hall up the &s;piral &s;tair|ca&s;e of the abbey: re&s;i&s;tance was u&s;ele&s;s, but I looked around in the hope of &s;eeing &s;ome per&s;on le&s;s obdurate than the men who brought me hither; &s;ome one who might be &s;en&s;ible to pity, and capable, at lea&s;t, of civil treat|ment. I looked in vain; no per&s;on appear|ed: and this circum&s;tance confirmed my wor&s;t apprehen&s;ions. The &s;ecrecy of the bu|&s;ine&s;s foretold a horrible conclu&s;ion. Having pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome chambers, they &s;topped in one hung with old tape&s;try. I inquired why we did not go on, and was told, I &s;hould &s;oon know.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="221">
<Q REND="inline">"At that moment, I expected to &s;ee the in|&s;trument of death uplifted, and &s;ilently re|commended my&s;elf to God, but death was not then de&s;igned for me; the arras, and di&s;|covered a door, which they then opened. Seizing my arms, they led me through a &s;uite of di&s;mal chambers beyond. Having reached the farthe&s;t of the&s;e, they again &s;top|ped: the horrid gloom of the place &s;eemed congenial to murder, and in&s;pired deadly thoughts. Again I looked round for the in&s;trument of de&s;truction, and again I was re&s;pited. I &s;upplicated to know what was de&s;igned me; it was now unnece&s;&s;ary to a&s;k who was the author of the de&s;ign. They were &s;ilent to my que&s;tion, but at length told me, this chamber was my pri&s;on. Having &s;aid this, and &s;et down a jug of water, they left the room, and I heard the door barred upon me.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O &s;ound of de&s;pair! O moment of unut|terable angui&s;h! The pang of death it&s;elf is, &s;urely, not &s;uperior to that I then &s;uffered.

<P>Here &s;everal pages of the manu&s;cript were decayed with damp and totally illegible. With

<P><Q REND="inline">"Three days have now pa&s;&s;ed in &s;olitude and &s;ilence: the horrors of death are ever before my eyes, let me endeavour to prepare for the dreadful change! When I awake in the morning I think I &s;hall not live to &s;ee another night; and, when night returns, that I mu&s;t never more unclo&s;e my eyes on morning.

<P><Q REND="inline">"O my children! O friends far di&s;tant!

Ye believe me happy, or ye would fly to my relief. I know that what I now write cannot avail me, yet there is comfort in pouring forth my griefs; and I ble&s;s that man, le&s;s &s;avage than his fel|lows, who has &s;upplied me the&s;e means of recording them. Alas! he knows full well, that from this indulgence he has nothing to fear. My pen can call no friends to &s;uccour me, nor reveal my danger ere it is too late. O! ye, who may hereafter read what I now

write, give a tear to my &s;ufferings: I have wept often for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of my fellow creatures!"</Q></P>

Here the wretched writer appealed directly to her heart; he &s;poke in the energy of truth, and, by a &s;trong illu&s;ion of fancy, it &s;eemed as if his pa&s;t &s;ufferings were at this moment pre&s;ent.

There was a gla&s;s before her upon the table, and &s;he feared to rai&s;e her looks towards it, le&s;t &s;ome other face than her own &s;hould meet her eyes: other dreadful ideas, and &s;trange images of fanta&s;tic thought now cro&s;&s;ed her mind.</P>

family, but unwillingne&s;s to di&s;turb them, and a dread of ridicule, withheld her. She was al&s;o afraid to move and almo&s;t to breathe. As &s;he li&s;tened to the wind, that murmured at the ca&s;ements of her lonely chamber, &s;he again thought &s;he heard a &s;igh. Her imagination refu&s;ed any longer the controul of rea&s;on, and, turning her eyes, a figure, who&s;e exact form &s;he could not di&s;tingui&s;h, appeared to pa&s;s along an ob&s;cure part of the chamber; a dreadful chillne&s;s came over her, and &s;he &s;at fixed in her chair. At length a deep &s;igh &s;omewhat relieved her oppre&s;&s;ed &s;pirits, and her &s;en&s;es &s;eemed to return.</P>
<P>All remaining quiet, after &s;ome time &s;he be|gan to que&s;tion whether her fancy had not de|ceived her, and &s;he &s;o far conquered her terror as to de&s;i&s;t from calling Madame La Motte: her mind was, however, &s;o much di&s;turbed, that &s;he did not venture to tru&s;t her&s;elf that night again with the MS.; but, having &s;pent &s;ome time in prayer, and in endeavouring to compo&s;e her &s;pirits, &s;he retired to bed.</P>
<P>When &s;he awoke in the morning, the cheer|ful &s;un-beams played upon the ca&s;ements, and di&s;pelled the illu&s;ions of darkne&s;s: her mind, &s;oothed and invigorated by &s;leep, rejected the my&s;tic and turbulent promptings of imagination. She aro&s;e refre&s;hed and thankful; but, upon going down to breakfa&s;t, this tran&s;ient gleam of peace fled upon the appearance of the Marquis,
<PB N="225" REF="227">
who&s;e frequent vi&s;its at the abbey, after what had pa&s;&s;ed, not only di&s;plea&s;ed, but alarmed her. She &s;aw that he was determined to per&s;evere in addre&s;&s;ing her, and the boldne&s;s and in&s;en&s;ibility of this conduct, while it excited her indignation, increa&s;ed her di&s;gu&s;t. In pity to La Motte, &s;he endeavoured to conceal the&s;e emotions, though &s;he now thought that he required too much from her complai&s;ance, and began &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider how &s;he might avoid the nece&s;&s;ity of continuing it. The Marquis behaved to her with the mo&s;t re&s;pectful attention; but Adeline was &s;ilent and re&s;erved, and &s;eized the fir&s;t op|portunity of withdrawing.</P>
<P>As &s;he pa&s;&s;ed up the &s;piral &s;tairca&s;e, Peter entered the hall below, and, &s;eeing Adeline, he &s;topped and looked earne&s;tly at her: &s;he did not ob&s;erve him, but he called her &s;oftly, and &s;he then &s;aw him make a &s;ignal as if he had &s;omething to communicate. In the next in&s;tant La Motte opened the door of the vaulted room, and Peter ha&s;tily di&s;appeared. She proceeded to her chamber, ruminating upon this &s;ignal, and the cautious manner in which Peter had given it.</P>
<P>But her thoughts &s;oon returned to their wonted &s;ubjects. Three days were now pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;he heard no intelligence of her father; &s;he began to hope that he had relented from the violent mea&s;ures hinted at by La Motte, and that he meant to pur&s;ue a milder plan; but when
<PB N="226" REF="228">
&s;he con&s;idered his character, this appeared im|probable, and &s;he relap&s;ed into her former fears. Her re&s;idence at the abbey was now become painful, from the per&s;everance of the Marquis, and the conduct which La Motte obliged her to adopt; yet &s;he could not think without dread of quitting it to return to her father.</P>
<P>The image of Theodore often intruded upon her bu&s;y thoughts, and brought with it a pang, which his &s;trange departure occa&s;ioned. She had a confu&s;ed notion, that his fate was &s;ome|how connected with her own; and her &s;truggles to prevent the remembrance of him, &s;erved only to &s;hew how much her heart was his.</P>
<P>To divert her thoughts from the&s;e &s;ubjects; and gratify the curio&s;ity &s;o &s;trongly excited on the preceding night, &s;he now took up the MS. but was hindered from opening it by the entrance of Madame La Motte, who came to tell her the Marquis was gone. They pa&s;&s;ed their morning together in work and general con|ver&s;ation; La Motte not appearing till dinner, when he &s;aid little, and Adeline le&s;s. She a&s;ked him, however, if he had heard from her father? <Q REND="inline">"I have not heard from him,"</Q> &s;aid La Motte; <Q REND="inline">"but there is good rea&s;on, as I am informed by the Marquis, to believe he is not far off."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline was &s;hocked, yet &s;he was able to reply with becoming firmne&s;s. <Q REND="inline">"I have already, Sir, involved you too much in my di&s;tre&s;s,
<PB N="227" REF="229">
and now &s;ee that re&s;i&s;tance will de&s;troy you, without &s;erving me; I am, therefore, con|tented to return to my father, and thus &s;pare you farther calamity."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This is a ra&s;h determination,"</Q> replied La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"and if you purfue it, I fear you will &s;everely repent. I &s;peak to you as a friend, Adeline, and de&s;ire you will endeavour to li&s;ten to me without prejudice. The Mar|quis, I find, has offered you his hand. I know not which circum&s;tance mo&s;t excites my &s;urprize, that a man of his rank and confequence &s;hould &s;olicit a marriage with a per&s;on without fortune, or o&s;ten&s;ible con|nections; or that a per&s;on &s;o circum&s;tanced &s;hould even for a moment reject the advan|tages thus offered her. You weep, Adeline, let me hope that you are convinced of the ab&s;urdity of this conduct, and will no longer trifle with your good fortune. The kindne&s;s I have &s;hewn you mu&s;t convince you of my regard, and that I have no motive for of|fering you this advice but your advantage. It is nece&s;&s;ary, however, to &s;ay, that, &s;hould your father not in&s;i&s;t upon your removal, I know not how long my circum&s;tances may enable me to afford even the humble pittance you receive here. Still you are &s;ilent."</Q></P>
<P>The angui&s;h which this &s;peech excited, &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed her utterance, and &s;he continued to weep. At length &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Suffer me, Sir,

<P><Q REND="inline">"Pardon me,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline, <Q REND="inline">"a marriage with the Marquis would be &s;plendid, but never happy. His character excites my aver&s;ion, and I entreat, Sir, that he may no more be mentioned."</Q></P>

<P>THE conver&s;ation related in the la&s;t chapter was interrupted by the entrance of Peter, who, as he left the room, looked &s;ignificantly at Adeline and almo&s;t beckoned. She was anxious to know what he meant, and &s;oon after went into the hall, where &s;he found him loitering. The moment he &s;aw her, he made a &s;ign of &s;ilence and beckoned her into the rece&s;s. <Q REND="inline">"Well, Peter, what is it you would &s;ay?"</Q> &s;aid Adeline.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Hu&s;h, Ma'm&s;elle; for Heaven's &s;ake &s;peak lower: if we &s;hould be overheard, we are all blown up."&mdash;</Q>Adeline begged him to explain what he meant. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Ma'm&s;elle, that is what I have wanted all day long.

<P>Adeline entreated he would be quick. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Ma'am, but I'm &s;o afraid we &s;hall be &s;een;
<PB N="230" REF="232">
but I would do much to &s;erve &s;uch a good young lady, for I could not bear to think of what threatened you, without telling you of it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For God's &s;ake,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline, <Q REND="inline">"&s;peak quickly, or we &s;hall be interrupted."</Q></P>

I would not for the world we &s;hould be &s;een."</Q>&mdash;Adeline was much alarmed by Peter's words, and hurried to the cloi&s;ters. He quickly appeared, and, looking cautiou&s;ly round, re&s;umed his di&s;cour&s;e. <Q REND="inline">"As I was &s;ay|ing, Ma'm&s;elle, Monday night, when the Marquis &s;lept here, you know he &s;at up very late, and I can gue&s;s, perhaps, the rea&s;on of that.

<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray do &s;peak to the purpo&s;e,"</Q> &s;aid Ade|line impatiently, <Q REND="inline">"what is this danger which you &s;ay threatens me? Be quick, or we &s;hall be ob&s;erved."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Danger enough, Ma'm&s;elle,"</Q> replied Pe|ter, <Q REND="inline">"if you knew all, and when you do, what

<P><Q REND="inline">"Or rather you are re&s;olved not to tell me,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline; <Q REND="inline">"for you have made no progre&s;s towards it. But what do you mean? You was &s;peaking of the Marquis."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Hu&s;h, Ma'am, not &s;o loud. The Mar|quis, as I &s;aid, &s;at up very late and my ma&s;|ter &s;at up with him. One of his men went to bed in the oak room, and the other &s;tayed to undre&s;s his Lord. So as we were &s;itting together&mdash;Lord have mercy! it made my hair &s;tand on end! I tremble yet. So as we were &s;itting together,&mdash;but as &s;ure as I live yonder is my ma&s;ter: I caught a glimp&s;e of him between the trees, if he &s;ees me it is all over with us. I'll tell you another time."</Q> So &s;aying, he hurried into the abbey, leaving Ade|line in a &s;tate of alarm, curio&s;ity, and vexation. She walked out into the fore&s;t, ruminating upon Peter's words, and endeavouring to gue&s;s to what they alluded; there Madame La Motte joined her, and they conver&s;ed on various topics till they reached the abbey.</P>
<P>Adeline watched in vain through that day for an opportunity of &s;peaking with Peter. While he waited at &s;upper, &s;he occa&s;ionally ob&s;erved his countenance with great anxiety, hoping it might afford her &s;ome degree of intelligence on the &s;ubject of her fears. When &s;he retired,
<PB N="232" REF="234">
Madame La Motte accompanied her to her chamber, and continued to conver&s;e with her for a con&s;iderable time, &s;o that &s;he had no means of obtaining an interview with Peter.&mdash;Madame La Motte appeared to labour under &s;ome great affliction, and when Adeline, noti|cing this, entreated to know the cau&s;e of her de|jection, tears &s;tarted into her eyes, and &s;he ab|ruptly left the room.</P>
<P>This behaviour of Madame La Motte concur|red with Peter's di&s;cour&s;e, to alarm Adeline, who &s;at pen&s;ively upon her bed, given up to reflec|tion, till &s;he was rou&s;ed by the &s;ound of a clock which &s;tood in the room below, and which now &s;truck twelve. She was preparing for re&s;t, when &s;he recollected the MS. and was unable to conclude the night without reading it. The fir&s;t words &s;he could di&s;tingui&s;h were the fol|lowing.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Again I return to this poor con&s;olation&mdash;again I have been permitted to &s;ee another day. It is now midnight! my &s;olitary lamp burns be&s;ide me; the time is awful, but to me the &s;ilence of noon is as the &s;ilence of mid|night: a deeper gloom  is all in which they dif|fer.

This abbey&mdash;alas!"&mdash;</Q>Here the MS. was again illegible, and for &s;everal pages Adeline could only make out disjointed &s;entences.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O bitter draught! when, when &s;hall I have re&s;t! O my friends; will none of ye fly to aid me; will none of ye avenge my &s;ufferings? Ah! when it is too late&mdash;when I am gone for ever, ye will endeavourto avenge them. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Once more is night returned to me. Ano|ther day has pa&s;&s;ed in &s;olitude and mi&s;ery. I have climbed to the ca&s;ement, thinking the view of nature would refre&s;h my &s;oul, and &s;omewhat enable me to &s;upport the&s;e afflicti|ons. Alas I even this &s;mall comfort is denied me, the windows open towards other parts of this abbey, and admit only a portion of that day which I mu&s;t never more fully behold. La&s;t night! la&s;t night! O &s;cene of horror!" * *</Q></P>
<P>Adeline &s;huddered. She feared to read the coming &s;entence, yet curio&s;ity prompted her to proceed. Still &s;he pau&s;ed: an unaccountable dread came over her. <Q REND="inline">"Some horrid deed has been done here,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"the reports of the pea&s;ants are true.

She recollected the dagger which had im|peded her &s;teps in the &s;ecret chamber, and this circum&s;tance &s;erved to confirm her mo&s;t terri|ble conjectures. She wi&s;hed to examine it, but it lay in one of the&s;e chambers, and &s;he feared to go in que&s;t of it.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Wretched, wretched victim!"</Q> &s;he ex|claimed, <Q REND="inline">"could no friend re&s;cue thee from de&s;truction! O that I had been near! yet what could I have done to &s;ave thee? Alas! nothing. I forget that even now, perhaps, I am like thee abandoned to dangers, from which I have no friend to &s;uccour me. Too &s;urely I gue&s;s the author of my mi&s;eries!"</Q> She &s;topped and thought &s;he heard a &s;igh, &s;uch as, on the preceding night, had pa&s;&s;ed along the chamber. Her blood was chilled and &s;he &s;at motionle&s;s. The lonely &s;ituation of her room, remote from the re&s;t of the family, (for &s;he was now in her old apartment, from which Madame La Motte had removed) who were almo&s;t be|yond call, &s;truck &s;o forcibly upon her imagina|tion, that &s;he with difficulty pre&s;erved her&s;elf from fainting. She &s;at for a con&s;iderable time, but all was &s;till. When &s;he was &s;omewhat re|covered, her fir&s;t de&s;ign was to alarm the fa|mily; but farther reflection again withheld her.</P>
<P>She endeavoured to compo&s;e her &s;pirits, and addre&s;&s;ed a &s;hort prayer to that Being who had hitherto protected her in every danger. While
<PB N="235" REF="237">
&s;he was thus emploved, her mind gradually be|came elevated and re-a&s;&s;ured; a &s;ublime com|placency filled her heart, and &s;he &s;at down once more to pur&s;ue the narrative.</P>
<P>Several lines that immediately followed were obliterated.&mdash;</P>

I often viewed, with a momentary hope of e&s;caping, the high grated windows of my pri|&s;on&mdash;all things within the compa&s;s of po&s;&s;i|bility I was re&s;olved to try, and with an ea|ger de&s;peration I climbed towards the ca&s;e|ments, but my foot &s;lipped, and falling back to the floor, I was &s;tunned by the blow. On recovering, the fir&s;t &s;ounds I heard were the &s;teps of a per&s;on entering my pri&s;on. A re|collection of the pa&s;t returned, and deplora|ble was my condition.

<P><PB N="236" REF="238">
Adeline could not go on. All the circum&s;tan|ces that &s;eemed to corroborate the fate of this un|happy man, crowded upon her mind. The re|ports concerning the abbey&mdash;the dreams, which had forerun her di&s;covery of the private apart|ments&mdash;the &s;ingular manner in which &s;he had found the MS. and the apparition, which &s;he now believed &s;he had really &s;een.

<P>Such a combination of circum&s;tances &s;he be|lieved could only be produced by &s;ome &s;uperna|tural power, operating for the retribution of the guilty.

Still &s;he tried to command her feelings &s;o as to avoid di&s;turbing the family, but they became &s;o painful, than even the dread of La Motte's ridi|cule had hardly power to prevent her quitting the chamber. Her mind was now in &s;uch a &s;tate, that &s;he found it impo&s;&s;ible to pur&s;ue the &s;tory in the MS. though, to avoid the tortures of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, &s;he had attempted it. She laid it down again, and tried to argue her&s;elf into com|po&s;ure. <Q REND="inline">"What have I to fear?"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I am at lea&s;t innocent, and I &s;hall not be pu|ni&s;hed for the crime of another."</Q></P>
<P>The violent gu&s;t of wind that now ru&s;hed through the whole &s;uite of apartments, &s;hook the door that led from her late bedchamber to the private rooms &s;o forcibly, that Adeline, unable to remain longer in doubt, ran to &s;ee from whence the noi&s;e i&s;&s;ued. The arras, which concealed the door, was violently agitated, and &s;he &s;tood for a moment ob&s;erving it in inde&s;|cribable terror, till believing it was &s;wayed by the wind, &s;he made a &s;udden effort to overcome her feelings, and was &s;tooping to rai&s;e it. At that in&s;tant, &s;he thought &s;he heard a voice. She &s;topped and li&s;tened, but every thing was &s;till; yet apprehen&s;ion &s;o far overcame her, that &s;he had no power, either to examine, or to leave the chambers.</P>
<P>In a few moments the voice returned, &s;he was now convinced &s;he had not been deceived, for, though low, &s;he heard it di&s;tinctly, and
<PB N="238" REF="240">
was almo&s;t &s;ure it repeated her own name. So much was her fancy affected, that &s;he even thought it was the &s;ame voice &s;he had heard in her dreams. This conviction entirely &s;ubdued the &s;mall remains of her courage, and, &s;inking into a chair, &s;he lo&s;t all recollection.</P>
<P>How long &s;he remained in this &s;tate &s;he knew not, but when &s;he recovered, &s;he exerted all her &s;trength, and reached the winding &s;tairca&s;e, where &s;he called aloud. No one heard her, and &s;he ha&s;tened, as fa&s;t as her feeblene&s;s would permit, to the chamber of Madame La Motte. She tapped gently at the door, and was an&s;wered by Madame, who was alarmed at being awak|ened at &s;o unu&s;ual an hour, and believed that &s;ome danger threatened her hu&s;band. When &s;he under&s;tood that it was Adeline, and that &s;he was unwell, &s;he quickly came to her relief. The terror that was yet vi&s;ible in Adeline's countenance excited her inquiries, and the occa|&s;ion of it was explained to her.</P>
<P>Madame was &s;o much di&s;compo&s;ed by the relation that &s;he called La Motte from his bed, who, more angry at being di&s;turbed than inte|re&s;ted for the agitation he witne&s;&s;ed, reproved Adeline for &s;uffering her fancies to overcome her rea&s;on. She now mentioned the di&s;covery &s;he had made of the inner chambers and the manu&s;cript, circum&s;tances, which rou&s;ed the attention of La Motte &s;o much, that he de&s;ired
<PB N="239" REF="241">
to &s;ee the MS. and re&s;olved to go immediately to the apartments de&s;cribed by Adeline,</P>
<P>Madame La Motte endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade him from his purpo&s;e; but La Motte, with whom oppo&s;ition had always an effect contrary to the one de&s;igned, and who wi&s;hed to throw farther ridicule upon the terrors of Adeline, per&s;i&s;ted in his intention. He called to Peter to attend with a light, and in&s;i&s;ted that Madame La Motte and Adeline &s;hould accompany him; Madame La Motte de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed, and Adeline, at fir&s;t, declared &s;he could not go; but he would be obeyed.</P>
<P>They a&s;cended the tower, and entered the fir&s;t chambers together, for each of the party was reluctant to be the la&s;t; in the &s;econd chamber all was quiet and in order. Adeline pre&s;ented the MS. and pointed to the arras which concealed the door: La Motte lifted the arras, and opened the door; but Madame La Motte and Adeline entreated to go no farther&mdash;again he called to them to follow. All was quiet in the fir&s;t chamber; he expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urpri&s;e that the rooms &s;hould &s;o long have re|mained undi&s;covered, and was proceeding to the &s;econd, but &s;uddenly &s;topped. <Q REND="inline">"We will defer our examination till to-morrow,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"the damps of the&s;e apartments are un|whole&s;ome at any time; but they &s;trike one more &s;en&s;ibly at night. I am chilled. Peter,
<PB N="240" REF="242">
remember to throw open the windows early in the morning, that the air may circulate."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord ble&s;s your honour,"</Q> &s;aid Peter, <Q REND="inline">"don't you &s;ee, I can't reach them? Be&s;ides I don't believe they are made to open; &s;ee what &s;trong iron bars there are; the room looks, for all the world, like a pri&s;on; I &s;uppo&s;e this is the place the people meant, when they &s;aid, nobody that had been in ever came out."</Q> La Motte, who, during this &s;peech, had been looking attentively at the high windows, which, if he had &s;een them at fir&s;t, he had certainly not ob&s;erved; now in|terrupted the eloquence of Peter, and bade him carry the light before them. They all willingly quitted the&s;e chambers, and returned to the room below, where a fire was lighted, and the party remained together for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>La Motte, for rea&s;ons be&s;t known to him&s;elf, attempted to ridicule the di&s;covery and fears of Adeline, till &s;he, with a &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s that checked him, entreated he would de&s;i&s;t. He was &s;ilent, and &s;oon after, Adeline, encouraged by the return of day-light, ventured to her chamber, and, for &s;ome hours, experienced the ble&s;&s;ing of undi&s;turbed repo&s;e.</P>
<P>On the following day, Adeline's fir&s;t care was to obtain an interview with Peter, whom &s;he had &s;ome hopes of &s;eeing as &s;he went down &s;tairs; he, however did not appear, and &s;he proceeded to the &s;itting room, where &s;he found
<PB N="241" REF="243">
La Motte, apparently much di&s;turbed. Adeline a&s;ked him if he had looked at the MS. <Q REND="inline">"I have run my eye over it,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"but it is &s;o much ob&s;cured by time that it can &s;carcely be decyphered. It appears to exhibit a &s;trange romantic &s;tory; and I do not won|der, that after you had &s;uffered its terrors to impre&s;s your imagination, you fancied you &s;aw &s;pectres, and heard wondrous noi&s;es."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline thought La Motte did not chu&s;e to be convinced, and &s;he, therefore, forbore re|ply. During breakfa&s;t, &s;he often looked at Peter, (who waited) with anxious inquiry; and, from his countenance, was &s;till more a&s;|&s;ured, that he had &s;omething of importance to communicate. In the hope of &s;ome conver&s;a|tion with him, &s;he left the room as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and repaired to her favourite avenue, where &s;he had not long remained when he ap|peared. <Q REND="inline">"God ble&s;s you! Ma'am&s;elle,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"I'm &s;orry I frighted you &s;o la&s;t night."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Frighted me,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline: <Q REND="inline">"how was you concerned in that?"</Q></P>
<P>He then informed her, that when he thought Mon&s;ieur and Madame La Motte were a&s;leep, he had &s;tole to her chamber door, with an in|tention of giving her the &s;equel of what he had begun in the morning; that he had called &s;e|veral times as loudly as he dared, but receiving no an&s;wer, he believed &s;he was a&s;leep, or did not chu&s;e to &s;peak with him, and he had,
<PB N="242" REF="244">
therefore, left the door. This account of the voice &s;he had heard relieved Adeline's &s;pirits; &s;he was even &s;urpri&s;ed that &s;he did not know it, till remembering the perturbation of her mind for &s;ome time preceding, this &s;urpri&s;e di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>She entreated Peter to be brief in explaining the danger with which &s;he was threatened. <Q REND="inline">"If you'll let me go on my own way, Ma'am, you'll &s;oon know it; but if you hurry me, and a&s;k me que&s;tions, here and there, out of their places, I don't know what I am &s;aying."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Be it &s;o;"</Q> &s;aid Adeline, <Q REND="inline">"only remember that we may be ob&s;erved."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, Ma'am&s;elle, I'm as much afraid of that as you are, for I believe I &s;hould be almo&s;t as ill off; however, that is neither here nor there, but I'm &s;ure, if you &s;tay in this old abbey another night, it will be wor&s;e for you; for, as I &s;aid before, I know all about it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What mean you, Peter?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, about this &s;cheme that's going on."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What, then, is my father?"&mdash;</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Your father,"</Q> interrupted Peter; <Q REND="inline">"Lord ble&s;s you, that is all fudge, to frighten you; your father, <HI>nor nobody</HI> el&s;e has ever &s;ent after you; I dare &s;ay, he knows no more of you than the Pope does&mdash;not he."</Q> Adeline looked
<PB N="243" REF="245">
di&s;plea&s;ed. <Q REND="inline">"You trifle,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"if you have any thing to tell, &s;ay it quickly; I am in ha&s;te."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ble&s;s you, young Lady, I meant no harm, I hope you're not angry; but I'm &s;ure you can't deny that your father is cruel. But, as I was &s;aying, the Marquis de Montalt likes you; and he and my ma&s;ter (Peter looked round) having been laying their heads together about you."</Q> Adeline turned pale&mdash;&s;he comprehended a part of the truth, and ea|gerly entreated him to proceed.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"They have been laying their heads together about you. This is what Jacques, the Marquis's man, tells me: Says he, Peter, you little know what is going on&mdash;I could tell all if I cho&s;e it, but it is not for tho&s;e who are tru&s;ted to tell again. I warrant now your ma&s;ter is clo&s;e enough with you. Upon which I was piqued, and re&s;olved to make him believe I could be tru&s;ted as well as he. Perhaps not, &s;ays I, perhaps I know as much as you, though I do not chu&s;e to brag on't; and I winked.&mdash;Do you &s;o? &s;ays he, then you are clo&s;er than I thought for. She is a fine girl, &s;ays he, meaning you, Ma'am&s;elle; but &s;he is nothing but a poor foundling after all&mdash;&s;o it does not much &s;ig|nify." I had a mind to know farther what he meant&mdash;&s;o I did not knock him down. By &s;eeming to know as much as he, I at la&s;t
<PB N="244" REF="246">
made him di&s;cover all, and he told me&mdash;but you look pale, Ma'am&s;elle, are you ill?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline, in a tremulous accent, and &s;carcely able to &s;upport her&s;elf, <Q REND="inline">"pray proceed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And he told me, that the Marquis had been courting you a good while, but you would not li&s;ten to him, and had even pre|tended he would marry you, and all would not do. As for marriage, &s;ays I, I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he knows the Marchione&s;s is alive; and I'm &s;ure &s;he is not one for his turn upon other terms."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The Marchione&s;s is really living then!"</Q> &s;aid Adeline.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O yes, Ma'am&s;elle! we all know that, and I thought you had known it too."&mdash;"We &s;hall &s;ee that, replies Jacques; at lea&s;t, I believe, that our ma&s;ter will outwit her."&mdash;I &s;tared; I could not help it&mdash;"Aye, &s;ays he, you know your ma&s;ter has agreed to give her up to my Lord."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good God! what will become of me?"</Q> exclaimed Adeline.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Aye, Ma'am&s;elle, I am &s;orry for you; but hear me out. When Jacques &s;aid this, I quite forgot my&s;elf. I'll never believe it, &s;aid I; I'll never believe my ma&s;ter would be guilty of &s;uch a ba&s;e action: he'll not give her up, or I'm no Chri&s;tian."&mdash;"Oh! &s;aid Jacques, for that matter, I thought
<PB N="245" REF="247">
you'd known all, el&s;e I &s;hould not have &s;aid a word about it. However, you may &s;oon &s;atisfy your&s;elf by going to the parlour door, as I have done; they're in con&s;ultation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> it now, I dare &s;ay."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You need not repeat any more of this conver&s;ation,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline; <Q REND="inline">"but tell me the re&s;ult of what you heard from the parlour"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, Ma'am&s;elle, when he &s;aid this, I took him at his word and went to the door, where, &s;ure enough, I heard my ma&s;ter and the Marquis talking about you. They &s;aid a great deal, which I could make nothing of; but, at la&s;t, I heard the Marquis &s;ay, You know the terms; on the&s;e terms only will I con&s;ent to bury the pa&s;t in ob&mdash;ob&mdash;oblivion&mdash;that was the word. Mon&s;ieur La Motte then told the Marquis, if he would re|turn to the abbey upon &s;uch a night, mean|ing this very night, Ma'am&s;elle, every thing &s;hould be prepared according to his wi&s;hes; Adeline &s;hall then be yours, my Lord, &s;aid he,&mdash;you are already acquainted with her chamber."</Q></P>
<P>At the&s;e words, Adeline cla&s;ped her hands and rai&s;ed her eyes to Heaven in &s;ilent de&s;pair.&mdash;Peter went on. <Q REND="inline">"When I heard this, I could not doubt what Jacques had &s;aid.&mdash;"Well, &s;aid he, what do you think of it now?"&mdash;"Why, that my ma&s;ter's a ra&s;cal, &s;ays I."&mdash;"It's well you don't think mine one too, &s;ays
<PB N="246" REF="248">
he,"&mdash;"Why, as for that matter, &s;ays I"&mdash;</Q>Adeline, interrupting him, inquired if he had heard any thing farther. <Q REND="inline">"Ju&s;t then,"</Q> &s;aid Peter, <Q REND="inline">"we heard Madame La Motte come out from another room, and &s;o we made ha&s;te back to the kitchen."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"She was not pre&s;ent at this conver&s;ation then?"</Q> &s;aid Adeline. <Q REND="inline">"No, Ma'am&s;elle, but my ma&s;ter has told her of it, I warrant."</Q> Adeline was almo&s;t as much &s;hocked by this apparent per&s;idy of Madame La Motte, as by a knowledge of the de&s;truction that threatened her. After mu&s;ing a few moments in extreme agitation, <Q REND="inline">"Peter,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"you have a good heart, and feel a ju&s;t indignation at your ma&s;ter's treachery&mdash;will you a&s;&s;i&s;t me to e&s;|cape?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah, Ma'am&s;elle!"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"how can I a&s;|&s;i&s;t you; be&s;ides, where can we go? I have no friends about here, no more than your|&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O!"</Q> replied Adeline, in extreme emotion, <Q REND="inline">"we fly from enemies; &s;trangers may prove friends: a&s;&s;i&s;t me but to e&s;cape from this fo|re&s;t, and you will claim my eternal gratitude: I have no fears beyond it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, as for this fore&s;t,"</Q> replied Peter, <Q REND="inline">"I am weary of it my&s;elf; though, when we fir&s;t came, I thought it would be fine living here, at lea&s;t, I thought it was very differ|ent from any life I had ever lived before. But

the&s;e gho&s;ts that haunt the abbey, I am no more a coward than other men, but I don't like them: and then there <HI>is</HI> &s;o many &s;trange reports abroad; and my ma&s;ter&mdash;I thought I could have &s;erved him to the end of the world, but now I care not how &s;oon I leave him, for his behaviour to you, Ma'am&s;elle."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You con&s;ent, then, to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in e&s;cap|ing?"</Q> &s;aid Adeline with eagerne&s;s.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why as to that, Ma'am&s;elle, I would wil|lingly if I knew where to go. To be &s;ure, I have a &s;i&s;ter lives in Savoy, but that is a great way off: and I have &s;aved a little money out of my wages, but that won't carry us &s;uch a long journey."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Regard not that,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline, <Q REND="inline">"If I was once beyond this fore&s;t, I would then endea|vour to take care of my&s;elf, and repay you for your kindne&s;s."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O! as for that, Madam"&mdash;</Q>Well, well, <Q REND="inline">"Peter, let us con&s;ider how we may e&s;cape. This night, &s;ay you, this night&mdash;the Mar|quis is to return?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, Ma'am&s;elle, to-night, about dark I have ju&s;t thought of a &s;cheme: My ma&s;|ter's hor&s;es are grazing in the fore&s;t, we may take one of them, and &s;end it back from the fir&s;t &s;tage: but how &s;hall we avoid being &s;een? be&s;ides, if we go off in the day-light, he will &s;oon pur&s;ue and overtake us; and if you &s;tay till night, the Marquis will be
<PB N="248" REF="250">
come, and then there is no chance. If they mi&s;s us both at the &s;ame time too, they'll gue&s;s how it is, and &s;et off directly. Could not you contrive to go fir&s;t and wait for me till the hurly-burly's over? Then, while they're &s;earching in the place under ground for you, I can &s;lip away, and we &s;hould be out of their reach, before they thought of pur&s;uing us."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline agreed to the truth of all this, and was &s;omewhat &s;urprized at Peter's &s;agacity. She inquired if he knew of any place in the neigh|bourhood of the abbey, where &s;he could remain concealed till he came with a hor&s;e. <Q REND="inline">"Why yes, Madam, there is a place, now I think of it, where you may be &s;afe enough, for no|body goes near: but they &s;ay it's haunted, and, perhaps, you would not like to go there."</Q> Adeline, remembering the la&s;t night, was &s;omewhat &s;tartled at this intelligence; but a &s;en&s;e of her pre&s;ent danger pre&s;&s;ed again upon her mind, and overcame every other apprehen|&s;ion. <Q REND="inline">"Where is this place?"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"if it will conceal me, I &s;hall not he&s;itate to go."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is an old tomb that &s;tands in the thicke&s;t part of the fore&s;t about a quarter of a mile off the neare&s;t way, and almo&s;t a mile the other. When my ma&s;ter u&s;ed to hide him&s;elf &s;o much in the fore&s;t, I have followed him &s;ome|where thereabouts, but I did not find out the tomb till t'other day. However, that's nei|ther
<PB N="249" REF="251">
here nor there; if you dare venture to it, Ma'am&s;elle, I'll &s;hew you the neare&s;t way."</Q> So &s;aying, he pointed to a winding path on the right. Adeline, having looked round, without perceiving any per&s;on near, directed Peter to lead her to the tomb: they pur&s;ued the path, till turning into a gloomy romantic part of the fo|re&s;t, almo&s;t impervious to the rays of the &s;un, they came to the &s;pot whither Louis had formerly traced his father.</P>
<P>The &s;tillne&s;s and &s;olemnity of the &s;cene &s;truck awe upon the heart of Adeline, who pau&s;ed and &s;urveyed it for &s;ome time in &s;ilence. At length, Peter led her into the interior part of the ruin, to which they de&s;cended by &s;everal &s;teps. <Q REND="inline">"Some old Abbot,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"was formerly buried here, as the Marquis's people &s;ay; and it's like enough that he belonged to the abbey yonder.

<P><Q REND="inline">"I hope not,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That's more than can be &s;aid for all that lies buried at the abbey though, and"&mdash;</Q>Adeline interrupted him; <Q REND="inline">"Hark! &s;urely, I hear a noi&s;e;"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"Heaven protect us from di&s;covery!"</Q> They li&s;tened, but all was &s;till, and they went on. Peter opened a low door, and they entered upon a dark pa&s;&s;age, frequently ob&s;tructed by loo&s;e fragments of &s;tone, and along which they moved with cau|tion.
<PB N="250" REF="252">
<Q REND="inline">"Whither are we going?"</Q> &s;aid Adeline. <Q REND="inline">"&mdash;I &s;carcely know my&s;elf,"</Q> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">aid Peter, <Q REND="inline">"for I never was &s;o far before; but the place &s;eems quiet enough."</Q> Something ob&s;tructed his way; it was a door, which yielded to his hand, and di&s;covered a kind of cell, ob&s;curely &s;een by the twilight admitted through a grate above. A partial gleam &s;hot athwart the place, leaving the greate&s;t part of it in &s;hadow.</P>
<P>Adeline &s;ighed as &s;he &s;urveyed it. <Q REND="inline">"This is a frightful &s;pot,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"but if it will af|ford me a &s;helter, it is a palace.

In the du&s;k of the even|ing I can pa&s;s from the abbey with lea&s;t danger of being ob&s;erved, and in this cell I will wait your arrival. As &s;oon as Mon&s;ieur and Madame La Motte are engaged in &s;earch|ing the vaults, you will bring here a hor&s;e; three knocks upon the tomb &s;hall inform me of your arrival. For Heaven's &s;ake be cau|tious, and be punctual."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will, Ma'am&s;elle, let come what may."</Q></P>
<P>They re-a&s;cended to the fore&s;t, and Adeline, fearful of ob&s;ervation, directed Peter to run fir&s;t to the abbey, and invent &s;ome excu&s;e for his ab&s;ence, if he had been mi&s;&s;ed. When &s;he was again alone, &s;he yielded to a flood of tears, and indulged the exce&s;s of her di&s;tre&s;s. She &s;aw her&s;elf without friends, without relations,
<PB N="251" REF="253">
de&s;titute, forlorn, and abandoned to the wor&s;t of evils. Betrayed by the very per&s;ons, to who&s;e comfort &s;he had &s;o long admini&s;tered, whom &s;he had loved as her protectors, and revered as her parents! The&s;e reflections touched her heart with the mo&s;t afflicting &s;en&s;ations, and the &s;en&s;e of her immediate danger was for a while ab&s;or|bed in the grief occa&s;ioned by a di&s;covery of &s;uch guilt in others.</P>
<P>At length &s;he rou&s;ed all her fortitude, and turning towards the abbey, endeavoured to await with patience the hour of evening, and to &s;u&s;|tain an appearance of compo&s;ure in the pre&s;ence of Mon&s;ieur and Madame La Motte. For the pre&s;ent &s;he wi&s;hed to avoid &s;eeing either of them, doubting her ability to di&s;gui&s;e her emotions: having reached the abbey, &s;he, therefore, pa&s;|&s;ed on to her chamber. Here &s;he endeavoured to direct her attention to indifferent &s;ubjects, but in vain; the danger of her &s;ituation, and the &s;e|vere di&s;appointment &s;he had received, in the character of tho&s;e whom &s;he had &s;o much e&s;|teemed, and even loved, pre&s;&s;ed hard upon her thoughts. To a generous mind few circum&s;tan|ces are more afflicting than a di&s;covery of per|fidy in tho&s;e whom we have tru&s;ted, even though it may fail of any ab&s;olute inconvenience to our|&s;elves. The behaviour of Madame La Motte in thus, by concealment, con&s;piring to her de|&s;truction, particularly &s;hocked her.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="254">
<Q REND="inline">"How has my imagination deceived me!"</Q> &s;aid &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"what a picture did it draw of the goodne&s;s of the world! And mu&s;t I then be|lieve that every body is cruel and deceitful? No&mdash;let me &s;till be deceived, and &s;till &s;uffer, rather than be condemned to a &s;tate of &s;uch wretched &s;u&s;picion"</Q> She now endeavoured to extenuate the conduct of Madame La Motte, by attributing it to a fear of her hu&s;band. <Q REND="inline">"She dare not oppo&s;e his will,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"el&s;e &s;he would warn me of my danger, and a&s;&s;i&s;t me to e&s;cape from it. No&mdash;I will never believe her capable of con&s;piring my ruin. Terror alone keeps her &s;ilent."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline was &s;omewhat comforted by this thought. The benevolence of her heart taught her, in this in&s;tance, to &s;ophi&s;ticate. She per|ceived not, that by a&s;cribing the conduct of Madame La Motte to terror, &s;he only &s;oftened the degree of her guilt, imputing it to a motive le&s;s depraved, but not le&s;s &s;elfi&s;h. She remained in her chamber till &s;ummoned to dinner, when, drying her tears, &s;he de&s;cended with faltering &s;teps and a palpitating heart to the parlour. When &s;he &s;aw La Motte, in &s;pite of all her ef|forts, &s;he trembled and grew pale: &s;he could not behold, even with apparent indifference, the man who &s;he knew had de&s;tined her to de&s;truc|tion. He ob&s;erved her emotion, and inquiring if &s;he was ill, &s;he &s;aw the danger to which her agitation expo&s;ed her. Fearful le&s;t La Motte
<PB N="253" REF="255">
&s;hould &s;u&s;pect its true cau&s;e, &s;he rallied all her &s;pirits, and, with a look of complacency, an|&s;wered &s;he was well.</P>
<P>During dinner &s;he pre&s;erved a degree of com|po&s;ure, that effectually concealed the varied angui&s;h of her heart. When &s;he looked at La Motte, terror and indignation were her pre|dominant feelings; but when &s;he regarded Ma|dame La Motte, it was otherwi&s;e; gratitude for her former tenderne&s;s had long been con|firmed into affection, and her heart now &s;welled with the bitterne&s;s of grief and di&s;appointment. Madame La Motte appeared depre&s;&s;ed, and &s;aid little. La Motte &s;eemed anxious to pre|vent thought, by a&s;&s;uming a fictitious and un|natural gaiety: he laughed and talked, and threw off frequent bumpers of wine: it was the mirth of de&s;peration. Madame became alarmed, and would have re&s;trained him, but he per&s;i&s;ted in his libations to Bacchus till reflection &s;eemed to be almo&s;t overcome.</P>
<P>Madame La Motte, fearful that in the care|le&s;&s;ne&s;s of the pre&s;ent moment he might betray him&s;elf, withdrew with Adeline to another room. Adeline recollected the happy hours &s;he once pa&s;&s;ed with her, when confidence bani&s;hed re&s;erve, and &s;ympathy and e&s;teem dictated the &s;entiments of friend&s;hip: now tho&s;e hours were gone for ever; &s;he could no longer unbo&s;om her griefs to Madame La Motte; no longer even e&s;teem her. Yet, notwith&s;tanding all the
<PB N="254" REF="256">
danger to which &s;he was expo&s;ed by the cri|minal &s;ilence of the latter, &s;he could not con|ver&s;e with her, con&s;ciou&s;ly for the la&s;t time, without feeling a degree of &s;orrow, which wi&s;dom may call weakne&s;s, but to which bene|volence will allow a &s;ofter name.</P>
<P>Madame La Motte, in her conver&s;ation, appeared to labour under an almo&s;t equal op|pre&s;&s;ion with Adeline: her thoughts were ab|&s;tracted from the &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e, and there were long and frequent intervals of &s;ilence. Adeline more than once caught her gazing with a look of tenderne&s;s upon her, and &s;aw her eyes fill with tears. By this circum&s;tance &s;he was &s;o much affected, that &s;he was &s;everal times upon the point of throwing her&s;elf at her feet, and imploring her pity and protection. Cooler reflection &s;hewed her the extravagance and danger of this conduct: &s;he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed her emotions, but they at length compelled her to withdraw from the pre&s;ence of Madame La Motte.</P>

<P>ADELINE anxiou&s;ly watched from her chamber window the &s;un &s;et behind the di&s;tant hills, and the time of her departure draw nigh: it &s;et with uncommon &s;plendour, and threw a fiery gleam athwart the woods, and upon &s;ome &s;cattered fragments of the ruins, which &s;he could not gaze upon with indifference. <Q REND="inline">"Ne|ver, probably, again &s;hall I &s;ee the &s;un &s;ink below tho&s;e hills,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"or illumine this &s;cene!

<PB N="256" REF="258">
and tumult: every eye will be in &s;earch of me, every rece&s;s will be explored."</Q> The&s;e reflections in&s;pired her with new terror, and increa&s;ed her impatience to be gone.</P>
<P>Twilight gradually came on, and &s;he now thought it &s;ufficiently dark to venture forth; but, before &s;he went, &s;he kneeled down and addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to Heaven. She implored &s;up|port and protection, and committed her&s;elf to the care of the God of mercies. Having done this, &s;he quitted her chamber, and pa&s;&s;ed with cautious &s;teps down the winding &s;tairca&s;e. No per&s;on appeared, and &s;he proceeded through the door of the tower into the fore&s;t. She look|ed around; the gloom of the evening ob&s;cured every object.</P>
<P>With a trembling heart &s;he &s;ought the path pointed out by Peter, which led to the tomb; having found it, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed along forlorn and terrified. Often did &s;he &s;tart as the breeze &s;hook the light leaves of the trees, or as the bat flirted by, gamboling in the twilight; and of|ten, as &s;he looked back towards the abbey, thought &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed, amid the deepening gloom, the figures of men. Having proceeded &s;ome way, &s;he &s;uddenly heard the feet of hor&s;es, and &s;oon after a &s;ound of voices, among which &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed that of the Marquis: they &s;eemed to come from the quarter &s;he was ap|proaching, and evidently advanced. Terror for &s;ome minutes arre&s;ted her &s;teps; &s;he &s;tood
<PB N="257" REF="259">
in a &s;tate of dreadful he&s;itation: to proceed was to run into the hands of the Marquis; to return was to fall into the power of La Motte.</P>
<P>After remaining for &s;ome time uncertain whither to fly, the &s;ounds &s;uddenly took a dif|ferent direction, and wheeled towards the abbey. Adeline had a &s;hort ce&s;&s;ation of terror. She now under&s;tood that the Marquis had pa&s;&s;ed this &s;pot only in his way to the abbey, and &s;he ha&s;tened to &s;ecrete her&s;elf in the ruin. At length, after much difficulty, &s;he reached it, the deep &s;hades almo&s;t concealing it from her &s;earch. She pau&s;ed at the entrance, awed by the &s;olemnity that reigned within, and the utter darkne&s;s of the place; at length &s;he determined to watch without till Peter &s;hould arrive. <Q REND="inline">"If any per&s;on approaches,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I can hear them before they can &s;ee me, and I can then &s;ecrete my&s;elf in the cell."</Q></P>
<P>She leaned again&s;t a fragment of the tomb in trembling expectation, and, as &s;he li&s;tened, no found broke the &s;ilence of the hour. The &s;tate of her mind can only be imagined, by con|&s;idering that upon the pre&s;ent time turned the cri&s;is of her fate. <Q REND="inline">"They have now,"</Q> thought &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"di&s;covered my flight; even now they are &s;eeking me in every part of the abbey. I hear their dreadful voices call me; I &s;ee their eager looks."</Q> The power of imagi|nation almo&s;t overcame her. While &s;he yet looked around, &s;he &s;aw lights moving at a di&s;|tance;
<PB N="258" REF="260">
&s;ometimes they glimmered between the trees, and &s;ometimes they totally di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>They &s;eemed to be in a direction with the abbey; and &s;he now remembered, that in the morning &s;he had &s;een a part of the fabric through an opening in the fore&s;t. She had, therefore, no doubt that the lights &s;he &s;aw pro|ceeded from people in &s;earch of her; who, &s;he feared, not finding her at the abbey, might direct their &s;teps towards the tomb. Her place of refuge now &s;eemed too near her enemies to be &s;afe, and &s;he would have fled to a more di&s;|tant part of the fore&s;t, but recollected that Peter would not know where to find her.</P>
<P>While the&s;e thoughts pa&s;&s;ed over her mind, &s;he heard di&s;tant voices in the wind, and was ha&s;tening to conceal her&s;elf in the cell, when &s;he ob&s;erved the lights &s;uddenly di&s;appear. All was &s;oon after hu&s;hed in &s;ilence and darkne&s;s, yet &s;he endeavoured to find the way to the cell. She remembered the &s;ituation of the outer door and of the pa&s;&s;age, and having pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e &s;he unclo&s;ed the door of the cell. Within it was utterly dark. She trembled violently, but entered; and, having felt about the walls, at length &s;eated her&s;elf on a projection of &s;tone.</P>
<P>She here again addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to Heaven, and endeavoured to re-animate her &s;pirits till Peter &s;hould arrive. Above half an hour elap&s;ed in this gloomy rece&s;s, and no &s;ound foretold his
<PB N="259" REF="261">
approach. Her &s;pirits &s;unk, &s;he feared &s;ome part of their plan was di&s;covered, or interrupted, and that he was detained by La Motte. This conviction operated &s;ometimes &s;o &s;trongly upon her fears, as to urge her to quit the cell alone, and &s;eek in flight her only chance of e&s;cape.</P>
<P>While this de&s;ign was fluctuating in her mind, &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed through the grate above a clattering of hoofs. The noi&s;e approached, and at length &s;topped at the tomb. In the &s;uc|ceeding moment &s;he heard three &s;trokes of a whip; her heart beat, and for &s;ome moments her agitation was &s;uch, that &s;he made no effort to quit the cell. The &s;trokes were repeated: &s;he now rou&s;ed her &s;pirits, and, &s;tepping for|ward, a&s;cended to the fore&s;t. She called <Q REND="inline">"Pe|ter;"</Q> for the deep gloom would not permit her to di&s;tingui&s;h either man or hor&s;e. She was quickly an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"Hu&s;h! Ma'am&s;elle, our voices will betray us."</Q></P>
<P>They mounted and rode off as fa&s;t as the darkne&s;s would permit. Adeline's heart re|vived at every &s;tep they took. She inquired what had pa&s;&s;ed at the abbey, and how he had contrived to get away. <Q REND="inline">"Speak &s;oftly, Ma'am|&s;elle; you'll know all by and bye, but I can't tell you now."</Q> He had &s;carcely &s;poke ere they &s;aw lights move along at a di&s;tance; and coming now to a more open part of the fore&s;t, he &s;et off on a full gallop, and continued the
<PB N="260" REF="262">
pace till the hor&s;e could hold it no longer. They looked back, and no lights appearing, Adeline's terror &s;ub&s;ided. She inquired again what had pa&s;&s;ed at the abbey, when her flight was di&s;|covered. <Q REND="inline">"You may &s;peak without fear of being heard,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"we are gone be|yond their reach I hope."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, Ma'am&s;elle,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"you had not been gone long before the Marquis ar|rived, and Mon&s;ieur La Motte then found out you was fled. Upon this a great rout there was, and he talked a great deal with the Marquis."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Speak louder,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline, <Q REND="inline">"I cannot hear you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will, Ma'am&s;elle."&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh! Heavens!"</Q> interrupted Adeline, <Q REND="inline">"What voice is this? It is not Peter's. For God's &s;ake tell me who you are, and whither I am going?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You'll know that &s;oon enough, young lady,"</Q> an&s;wered the &s;tranger, for it was indeed not Peter; <Q REND="inline">"I am taking you where my ma&s;ter ordered."</Q> Adeline, not doubting he was the Marquis's &s;ervant, attempted to leap to the ground, but the man, di&s;mounting, bound her to the hor&s;e. One feeble ray of hope at length beamed upon her mind: &s;he en|deavoured to &s;often the man to pity, and plead|ed with all the genuine eloquence of di&s;tre&s;s; but he under&s;tood his intere&s;t too well to yield
<PB N="261" REF="263">
even for a moment to the compa&s;&s;ion, which, in &s;pite of him&s;elf, her artle&s;s &s;upplication in|&s;pired.</P>
<P>She now re&s;igned her&s;elf to de&s;pair, and, in pa&s;&s;ive &s;ilence, &s;ubmitted to her fate. They continued thus to travel, till a &s;torm of rain, accompanied by thunder and lightning, drove them to the covert of a thick grove. The man believed this a &s;afe &s;ituation, and Adeline was now too carele&s;s of life to attempt convincing him of his error. The &s;torm was violent and long, but as &s;oon as it abated they &s;et off on full gallop, and having continued to travel for about two hours, they came to the borders of the fo|re&s;t, and, &s;oon after, to a high lonely wall, which Adeline could ju&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h by the moon-light, which now &s;treamed through the parting clouds.</P>
<P>Here they &s;topped; the man di&s;mounted, and having opened a &s;mall door in the wall, he unbound Adeline, who &s;hrieked, though invo|luntarily and in vain, as he took her from the hor&s;e. The door opened upon a narrow pa&s;|&s;age, dimly lighted by a lamp, which hung at the farther end. He led her on; they came to another door; it opened and di&s;clo&s;ed a magni|ficent &s;aloon, &s;plendidly illuminated, and fitted up in the mo&s;t airy and elegant ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The walls were painted in fre&s;co, repre&s;ent|ing &s;cenes from Ovid, and hung above with &s;ilk drawn up in fe&s;toons and richly fringed. The
<PB N="262" REF="264">
&s;ofas were of a &s;ilk to &s;uit the hangings. From the centre of the ceiling, which exhibited a &s;cene from the Armida of Ta&s;&s;o, de&s;cended a &s;il|ver lamp of Etru&s;can form: it diffu&s;ed a blaze of light, that, reflected from large pier gla&s;&s;es, completely illuminated the &s;aloon. Bu&s;ts of Ho|race, Ovid, Anacreon, Tibullus, and Petro|nius Arbiter, adorned the rece&s;&s;es, and &s;tands of flowers, placed in Etru&s;can va&s;es, breathed the mo&s;t delicious perfume. In the middle of the apartment &s;tood a &s;mall table, &s;pread with a col|lation of fruits, ices, and liquors. No per&s;on appeared. The whole &s;eemed the works of enchantment, and rather re&s;embled the palace of a fairy than any thing of human conforma|tion.</P>
<P>Adeline was a&s;toni&s;hed, and inquired where &s;he was, but the man refu&s;ed to an&s;wer her que&s;tions, and, having de&s;ired her to take &s;ome &s;ome refre&s;hment, left her. She walked to the windows, from which a gleam of moon-light di&s;covered to her an exten&s;ive garden, where groves and lawns, and water glittering in the moon-beam, compo&s;ed a &s;cenery of varied and romantic beauty. <Q REND="inline">"What can this mean!"</Q> &s;aid &s;he: <Q REND="inline">"Is this a charm to lure me to de|&s;truction?"</Q> She endeavoured, with a hope of e&s;caping, to open the windows, but they were all fa&s;tened; &s;he next attempted &s;everal doors, and found them al&s;o &s;ecured.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="265">
Perceiving all chance of e&s;cape was removed, &s;he remained for &s;ome time given up to &s;orrow and reflection; but was at length drawn from her reverie by the notes of &s;oft mu&s;ic, breath|ing &s;uch dulcet and entrancing &s;ounds, as &s;u&s;|pended grief, and waked the &s;oul to tenderne&s;s and pen&s;ive plea&s;ure. Adeline li&s;tened in &s;ur|prize, and in&s;en&s;ibly became &s;oothed and inte|re&s;ted; a tender melancholy &s;tole upon her heart, and &s;ubdued every har&s;her feeling: but the moment the &s;train cea&s;ed, the enchantment di&s;&s;olved, and &s;he returned to a &s;en&s;e of her &s;i|tuation.</P>
<P>Again the mu&s;ic &s;ounded&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"mu&s;ic &s;uch as charmeth &s;leep"</Q> and again &s;he gradually yielded to its &s;weet magic. A female voice, accompa|nied by a lute, a hautboy, and a few other in|&s;truments, now gradually &s;welled into a tone &s;o exqui&s;ite, as rai&s;ed attention into ec&s;tacy. It &s;unk by degrees, and touched a few &s;imple notes with pathetic &s;oftne&s;s, when the mea&s;ure was &s;uddenly changed, and in a gay and airy melody Adeline di&s;tingui&s;hed the following words:

<P>The mu&s;ic cea&s;ed, but the &s;ound &s;till vibra|ted on her imagination, and &s;he was &s;unk in the plea&s;ing languor they had in&s;pired, when the door opened, and the Marquis de Montalt ap|peared. He approached the &s;ofa where Ade|line &s;at, and addre&s;&s;ed her, but &s;he heard not his voice&mdash;&s;he had fainted. He endeavoured to recover her, and at length &s;ucceeded; but when &s;he unclo&s;ed her eyes, and again beheld him, &s;he relap&s;ed into a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility, and having in vain tried various methods to re&s;tore her, he was obliged to call a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Two young women entered, and, when &s;he began to revive, he left them to prepare her for his re|appearance. When Adeline perceived that the Marquis was gone, and that &s;he was in the care of women, her &s;pirits gradually returned; &s;he looked at her attendants, and was &s;urpri|&s;ed to &s;ee &s;o much elegance and beauty.</P>
<P>Some endeavour &s;he made to intere&s;t their pity, but they &s;eemed wholly in&s;en&s;ible to her
<PB N="265" REF="267">
di&s;tre&s;s, and began to talk of the Marquis in terms of the highe&s;t admiration. They a&s;&s;ured her it would be her own fault if &s;he was not happy, and advi&s;ed her to appear &s;o in his pre|&s;ence. It was with the utmo&s;t difficulty that Adeline forbore to expre&s;s the di&s;dain which was ri&s;ing to her lips, and that &s;he li&s;tened to their di&s;cour&s;e in &s;ilence. But &s;he &s;aw the inconveni|ence and fruitle&s;&s;ne&s;s of oppo&s;ition, and &s;he com|manded her feelings.</P>
<P>They were thus proceeding in their prai&s;es of the Marquis, when he him&s;elf appeared, and, waving his hand, they immediately quitted the apartment. Adeline beheld him with a kind of mute de&s;pair, while he approached and took her hand, while &s;he ha&s;tily withdrew, and turning from him with a look of unutterable di&s;tre&s;s, bur&s;t into tears. He was for &s;ome time &s;ilent, and appeared &s;oftened by her angui&s;h. But again approaching, and addre&s;&s;ing her in a gentle voice, he entreated her pardon for the &s;tep, which de&s;pair, and, as he called it, love had prompted. She was too much ab&s;orbed in grief to reply, till he &s;olicited a return of his love, when her &s;orrow yielded to indignation, and &s;he reproached him with his conduct. He pleaded that he had long loved and &s;ought her upon ho|nourable terms, and his offer of tho&s;e terms he began to repeat, but, rai&s;ing his eyes towards Adeline, he &s;aw in her looks the contempt which he was con&s;cious he de&s;erved.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="268">
For a moment he was confu&s;ed, and &s;eemed to under&s;tand both that his plan was di&s;covered and his per&s;on de&s;pi&s;ed; but &s;oon re&s;uming his u&s;ual command of feature, he again pre&s;&s;ed his &s;uit, and &s;olicited her love<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> A little reflection &s;hewed Adeline the danger of exa&s;perating his pride, by an avowal of the contempt which his pretended offer of marriage excited; and &s;he thought it not improper, upon an occa&s;ion in which the honour and peace of her life was con|cerned, to yield &s;omewhat to the policy of di&s;&s;i|mulation.

<P><Q REND="inline">"Can you then wi&s;h, lovely Adeline, to fly from him who adores you?"</Q> replied the Mar|quis, with a &s;tudied air of tenderne&s;s. <Q REND="inline">"Why will you exact &s;o &s;evere a proof of my di&s;in|tere&s;tedne&s;s, a di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s which is not con|&s;i&s;tent with love?

<P>Adeline &s;aw the danger to which &s;he was now expo&s;ed, and interrupted him. <Q REND="inline">"<HI>De&s;erve</HI> my e&s;teem, Sir, and then you will <HI>obtain</HI> it: as a fir&s;t &s;tep towards which, liberate me from a confinement that obliges me to look on you only with terror and aver&s;ion. How can I believe your profe&s;&s;ions of love, while you &s;hew that you have no intere&s;t in my happine&s;s?"</Q> Thus did Adeline, to whom the arts and the practice of di&s;&s;imulation were hitherto equally unknown, conde&s;cend to make u&s;e of them in di&s;gui&s;ing her indignation and contempt. But though the&s;e arts were adopted only for the purpo&s;e of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, &s;he u&s;ed them with reluctance, and almo&s;t with ab|horrence; for her mind was habitually impreg|nated with the love of virtue, in thought, word, and action, and, while her end in u&s;ing
<PB N="268" REF="270">

<P>The Marquis per&s;i&s;ted in his &s;ophi&s;try. <Q REND="inline">"Can you doubt the reality of that love, which, to obtain you, has urged me to ri&s;que your di&s;plea&s;ure? But have I not con&s;ulted your happine&s;s, even in the very conduct which you condemn? I have removed you from a &s;olitary and de&s;olate ruin to a gay and &s;plendid villa, where every luxury is at your command, and where every per&s;on &s;hall be obedient to your wi&s;hes."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My fir&s;t wi&s;h is to go hence,"</Q> &s;aid Ade|line; <Q REND="inline">"I entreat, I conjure you, my Lord, no longer to detain me.

<P><Q REND="inline">"By Heaven!

<PB N="269" REF="271">
her hand, and in &s;ilent angui&s;h walked to a di&s;tant part of the &s;aloon; deep &s;ighs bur&s;t from her heart, and, almo&s;t fainting, &s;he leaned on a window-frame for &s;upport.</P>
<P>The Marquis followed her; <Q REND="inline">"Why <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;t in refu&s;ing to be happy?"</Q> &s;aid he; <Q REND="inline">"recollect the propo&s;al I have made you, and accept it, while it is yet in your power.

He now led her, and &s;he &s;uffered him, to a &s;eat near the banquet, at which he pre&s;&s;ed her to partake of a variety of confectionaries, par|ticularly of &s;ome liquors, of which he him|&s;elf drank freely: Adeline accepted only of a peach</P>
<P>And now the Marquis, who interpreted her &s;ilence into a &s;ecret compliance with his pro|po&s;al, re&s;umed all his gaiety and &s;pirit, while the long and ardent regards he be&s;towed on Adeline, overcame her with confu&s;ion and in|dignation. In the mid&s;t of the banquet, &s;oft mu&s;ic again &s;ounded the mo&s;t tender and im|pa&s;&s;ioned airs; but its effect on Adeline was now lo&s;t, her mind being too much embarra&s;&s;ed and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the pre&s;ence of the Marquis, to admit even the &s;oothings of harmony. A

&s;ong was now heard, written with that &s;ort of impotent art, by which &s;ome voluptuous poets believe they can at once conceal and recom|mend the principles of vice.

<P><PB N="272" REF="274">When the voice cea&s;ed, a mournful &s;train, played with exqui&s;ite expre&s;&s;ion, &s;ounded from a di&s;tant horn; &s;ometimes the notes floated on the air in &s;oft undulations&mdash;now they &s;welled into full and &s;weeping melody, and now died faintly into &s;ilence: when again they ro&s;e and trembled in &s;ounds &s;o &s;weetly tender, as drew tears from Adeline, and exclamations of rap|ture from the Marquis; he threw his arm round her, and would have pre&s;&s;ed her towards him, but &s;he liberated her&s;elf from his em|brace, and with a look, on which was impre&s;&s;ed the firm dignity of virtue, yet touched with &s;orrow, &s;he awed him to forbearance. Con|&s;cious of a &s;uperiority, which he was a&s;hamed to acknowledge, and endeavouring to de&s;pi&s;e the influence which he could not re&s;i&s;t, he &s;tood for a moment the &s;lave of virtue, though the votary of vice. Soon, however, he recovered his confidence, and began to plead his love; when Adeline, no longer animated by the &s;pirit &s;he had lately &s;hewn, and &s;inking beneath the languor and fatigue which the various and vio|lent agitations of her mind produced, entreated he would leave her to repo&s;e.</P>
<P>The palene&s;s of her countenance, and the tremulous tone of her voice, were too expre&s;|&s;ive to be mi&s;under&s;tood; and the Marquis, bidding her remember to-morrow, with &s;ome he&s;itation, withdrew. The moment &s;he was alone, &s;he yielded to the bur&s;ting angui&s;h of
<PB N="273" REF="275">
her heart, and was &s;o ab&s;orbed in grief, that it was &s;ome time before &s;he perceived &s;he was in the pre&s;ence of the young women, who had lately attended her, and had entered the &s;aloon &s;oon after the Marquis quitted it: they came to conduct her to her chamber. She followed them for &s;ome time in &s;ilence, till, prompted by de&s;peration, &s;he again endeavoured to awaken their compa&s;&s;ion: but again the prai&s;es of the Marquis were repeated, and perceiving that all attempts to intere&s;t them in her favour were in vain, &s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them. She &s;ecured the door through which they had departed, and then, in the languid hope of di&s;covering &s;ome means of e&s;cape, &s;he &s;urveyed her chamber. The airy elegance with which it was fitted up, and the luxurious accommodations with which it abound|ed, &s;eemed de&s;igned to fa&s;cinate the imagination, and to &s;educe the heart. The hangings were of &s;traw-coloured &s;ilk, adorned with a variety of land&s;capes and hi&s;torical paintings, the &s;ub|jects of which partook of the voluptuous cha|racter of the owner; the chimney-piece, of Parian marble, was ornamented with &s;everal repo&s;ing figures from the antique The bed was of &s;ilk the colour of the hangings, richly fringed with purple and &s;ilver, and the head made in form of a canopy. The &s;teps, which were placed near the bed to a&s;&s;i&s;t in a&s;cending it, were &s;upported by Cupids, apparently of &s;olid &s;ilver. China va&s;es, filled with per&s;ume, &s;tood in &s;e|veral
<PB N="274" REF="276">
of the rece&s;&s;es, upon &s;tands of the &s;ame &s;tructure as the toilet, which was magnificent, and ornamented with a variety of trinkets.</P>
<P>Adeline threw a tran&s;ient look upon the&s;e various objects, and proceeded to examine the windows, which de&s;cended to the floor, and opened into balconies towards the garden &s;he had &s;een from the &s;aloon. They were now fa&s;tened, and her efforts to move them were ineffectual; at length &s;he gave up the attempt. A door next attracted her notice, which &s;he found was not fa&s;tened; it opened upon a dre&s;&s;ing clo&s;et, to which &s;he de&s;cended by a few &s;teps: two windows appeared, &s;he ha&s;tened towards them; one refu&s;ed to yield, but her heart beat with &s;udden joy when the other opened to her touch.</P>
<P>In the tran&s;port of the moment, &s;he forgot that its di&s;tance from the ground might yet deny the e&s;cape &s;he meditated. She returned to lock the door of the clo&s;et, to prevent a &s;ur|prize, which, however, was unnece&s;&s;ary, that of the bed-room being already &s;ecured. She now looked out from the window; the garden lay before her, and &s;he perceived that the win|dow, which de&s;cended to the floor, was &s;o near the ground, that &s;he might jump from it with ea&s;e: almo&s;t in the moment &s;he perceived this, &s;he &s;prang forward and alighted &s;afely in an exten&s;ive garden, re&s;embling more an Engli&s;h
<PB N="275" REF="277">
plea&s;ure ground, than a &s;eries of French parterres.</P>
<P>Thence &s;he had little doubt of e&s;caping, either by &s;ome broken fence, or low part of the wall; &s;he tripped lightly along, for hope played round her heart. The clouds of the late &s;torm were now di&s;per&s;ed, and the moon|light, which &s;lept on the lawns and &s;pangled the flowerets, yet heavy with rain-drops, af|forded her a di&s;tinct view of the &s;urrounding &s;cenery: &s;he followed the direction of the high wall that adjoined the chateau, till it was con|cealed from her &s;ight by a thick wilderne&s;s, &s;o entangled with boughs and ob&s;cured by dark|ne&s;s, that &s;he feared to enter, and turned a&s;ide into a walk on the right; it conducted her to the margin of a lake overhung with lofty trees.</P>
<P>The moon-beams dancing upon the waters, that with gentle undulation played along the &s;hore, exhibited a &s;cene of tranquil beauty, which would have &s;oothed an heart le&s;s agitated than was that of Adeline: &s;he &s;ighed as &s;he tran&s;iently &s;urveyed it, and pa&s;&s;ed ha&s;tily on in &s;earch of the garden wall, from which &s;he had now &s;trayed a con&s;iderable way. After wan|dering for &s;ome time through alleys and over lawns, without meeting with any thing like a boundary to the grounds, &s;he again found her|&s;elf at the lake, and now traver&s;ed its border with the foot&s;teps of de&s;pair:&mdash;tears rolled down her cheeks. The &s;cene around exhibited only
<PB N="276" REF="278">
images of peace and delight; every object &s;eemed to repo&s;e; not a breath waved the foliage, not a &s;ound &s;tole through the air: it was in her bo&s;om only that tumult and di&s;tre&s;s prevailed. She &s;till pur&s;ued the windings of the &s;hore, till an opening in the woods con|ducted her up a gentle a&s;cent: the path now wound along the &s;ide of a hill, where the gloom was &s;o deep, that it was with &s;ome difficulty &s;he found her way: &s;uddenly, however, the avenue opened to a lofty grove, and &s;he per|ceived a light i&s;&s;ue from a rece&s;s at &s;ome di&s;tance.</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed, and her fir&s;t impul&s;e was to re|treat, but li&s;tening and hearing no &s;ound, a faint hope beamed upon her mind, that the per&s;on to whom the light belonged, might be won to favour her e&s;cape. She advanced, with trembling and cautious &s;teps, towards the re|ce&s;s, that &s;he might &s;ecretly ob&s;erve the per|&s;on, before &s;he ventured to enter it. Her emotion increa&s;ed as &s;he approached, and hav|ing reached the bower, &s;he beheld, through an open window, the Marquis, reclining on a &s;ofa, near which &s;tood a table, covered with fruit and wine. He was alone, and his coun|tenance was flu&s;hed with drinking.</P>
<P>While &s;he gazed, fixed to the &s;pot by terror, he looked up towards the ca&s;ement; the light gleamed &s;ull upon her face, but &s;he &s;tayed not to learn whether he had ob&s;erved her, for, with the &s;wiftne&s;s of &s;ound, &s;he left the place
<PB N="277" REF="279">
and ran, without knowing whether &s;he was pur&s;ued. Having gone a con&s;iderable way, fatigue, at length, compelled her to &s;top, and &s;he threw her&s;elf upon the turf, almo&s;t fainting with fear and languor. She knew if the Mar|quis detected her in an attempt to e&s;cape, he would, probably, bur&s;t the bounds which he had hitherto pre&s;cribed to him&s;elf, and that &s;he had the mo&s;t dreadful evils to expect. The palpitations of terror were &s;o &s;trong, that &s;he could with difficulty breathe.</P>
<P>She watched and li&s;tened in trembling ex|pectation, but no form met her eye, no &s;ound her ear; in this &s;tate &s;he remained a con&s;iderable time. She wept, and the tears &s;he &s;hed re|lieved her oppre&s;&s;ed heart. <Q REND="inline">"O my father!"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"why did you abandon your child? If you knew the dangers to which you have expo&s;ed her, you would, &s;urely, pity and relieve her. Alas! &s;hall I never find a friend; am I de&s;tined &s;till to tru&s;t and be deceived?&mdash;Peter too, could he be treache|rous?"</Q> She wept again, and then returned to a &s;en&s;e of her pre&s;ent danger, and to a con|&s;ideration of the means of e&s;caping it&mdash;but no means appeared.</P>
<P>To her imagination the grounds were bound|le&s;s; &s;he had wandered from lawn to lawn, and from grove to grove, without perceiving any termination to the place; the garden wall &s;he could not find, but &s;he re&s;olved neither to
<PB N="278" REF="280">
return to the chateau, nor to relinqui&s;h her &s;earch. As &s;he was ri&s;ing to depart, &s;he per|ceived a &s;hadow move along at &s;ome di&s;tance; &s;he &s;tood &s;till to ob&s;erve it. It &s;lowly advanced and then di&s;appeared, but pre&s;ently &s;he &s;aw a per&s;on emerge from the gloom, and approach the &s;pot where &s;he &s;tood. She had no doubt that the Marquis had ob&s;erved her, and &s;he ran with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed to the &s;hade of &s;ome woods on the left. Foot&s;teps pur&s;ued her, and &s;he heard her name repeated, while &s;he in vain endeavoured to quicken her pace.</P>
<P>Suddenly the &s;ound of pur&s;uit turned, and &s;unk away in a different direction: &s;he pau&s;ed to take breath; &s;he looked around and no per&s;on appeared. She now proceeded &s;lowly along the avenue, and had almo&s;t reached its termination, when &s;he &s;aw the &s;ame figure emerge from the woods and dart acro&s;s the avenue; it in&s;tantly pur&s;ued her and approached. A voice called her, but &s;he was gone beyond its reach, for &s;he had &s;unk &s;en&s;ele&s;s upon the ground: it was long before &s;he revived, when &s;he did, &s;he found her&s;elf in the arms of a &s;tranger, and made an effort to di&s;engage her&s;elf.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Fear nothing, lovely Adeline,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"fear nothing: you are in the arms of a friend, who will encounter any hazard for your &s;ake; who will protect you with his life."</Q> He pre&s;&s;ed her gently to his heart. <Q REND="inline">"Have you then forgot me?"</Q> continued he. She looked earne&s;tly at him, and was now convinced that it

was Theodore who &s;poke. Joy was her fir&s;t emotion; but recollecting his former abrupt departure, at a time &s;o critical to her &s;afety, and that he was the friend of the Marquis, a thou&s;and mingled &s;en&s;ations &s;truggled in her brea&s;t, overwhelmed her with mi&s;tru&s;t, appre|hen&s;ion and di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>Theodore rai&s;ed her from the ground, and while he yet &s;upported her, <Q REND="inline">"Let us immedi|ately fly from this place,"</Q> &s;aid he; <Q REND="inline">"a car|riage waits to receive us; it &s;hall go where|ever you direct, and convey you to your friends."</Q> This la&s;t &s;entence touched her heart: <Q REND="inline">"Alas, I have no friends!"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"nor do I know whither to go."</Q> Theodore gently pre&s;&s;ed her hand between his, and, in a voice of the &s;ofte&s;t compa&s;&s;ion, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>My</HI> friends then &s;hall be yours; &s;uffer me to lead you to them. But I am in agony while you remain in this place; let us ha&s;ten to quit it."</Q> Adeline was going to reply, when voices were heard among the trees, and Theodore, &s;upport|ing her with his arm, hurried her along the ave|nue: they continued their flight till Adeline, panting for breath, could go no farther.</P>
<P>Having pau&s;ed a while, and heard no foot&s;teps in pur&s;uit, they renewed their cour&s;e: Theodore knew that they were now not far from the gar|den wall; but he was al&s;o aware, that in the intermediate &s;pace &s;everal paths wound from re|mote parts of the grounds into the walk he was
<PB N="280" REF="282">
to pa&s;s, from whence the Marquis's people might i&s;&s;ue and intercept him. He, however, concealed his apprehen&s;ions from Adeline, and endeavoured to &s;oothe and &s;upport her &s;pirits.</P>
<P>At length they reached the wall, and Theo|dore was leading her towards a low part of it, near which &s;tood the carriage, when again they heard voices in the air. Adeline's &s;pirits and &s;trength were nearly exhau&s;ted, but &s;he made a la&s;t effort to proceed, and &s;he now &s;aw the ladder at &s;ome di&s;tance by which Theodore had de&s;cended to the garden. <Q REND="inline">"Exert your&s;elf yet a little longer,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"and you will be in &s;afety."</Q> He held the ladder while &s;he a&s;|cended; the top of the wall was broad and level, and Adeline, having reached it, remained there till Theodore followed and drew the ladder to the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>When they had de&s;cended, the carriage ap|peared in waiting, but without the driver. Theodore feared to call, left his voice &s;hould betray him; he, therefore, put Adeline into the carriage, and went him&s;elf in &s;earch of the po&s;tillion, whom he found a&s;leep under a tree at &s;ome di&s;tance; having awakened him, they re|turned to the vehicle, which &s;oon drove furi|ou&s;ly away. Adeline did not yet dare to believe her&s;elf &s;afe, but after proceeding a con&s;iderable time without interruption, joy bur&s;t upon her heart, and &s;he thanked her deliverer in terms of the warme&s;t gratitude. The &s;ympathy ex|pre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="281" REF="283">
in the tone of his voice and manner, pro|ved that his happine&s;s, on this occa&s;ion, almo&s;t equalled her own.</P>
<P>As reflection gradually &s;tole upon her mind, anxiety &s;uper&s;eded joy: in the tumult of the late moments, &s;he thought only of e&s;cape, but the circum&s;tances of her pre&s;ent &s;ituation now ap|peared to her, and &s;he became &s;ilent and pen&s;ive: &s;he had no friends to whom &s;he could fly, and was going with a young Chevalier, almo&s;t a &s;tranger to her, &s;he knew not whither. She re|membered how often &s;he had been deceived and betrayed where &s;he tru&s;ted mo&s;t, and her &s;pi|rits &s;unk: &s;he remembered al&s;o the former at|tention which Theodore had &s;hewn her, and dreaded le&s;t his conduct might be prompted by a &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ion. She &s;aw this to be po&s;&s;ible, but &s;he di&s;dained to believe it probable, and felt that nothing could give her greater pain than to doubt the integrity of Theodore.</P>
<P>He interrupted her reverie, by recurring to her late &s;ituation at the abbey. <Q REND="inline">"You would be much &s;urprized,"</Q> &s;aid he <Q REND="inline">"and, I fear, of|fended, that I did not attend my appointment at the abbey, after the alarming hints I had given you in our la&s;t interview. That cir|cum&s;tance has, perhaps, injured me in your e&s;teem, if, indeed, I was ever &s;o happy as to po&s;&s;e&s;s it: but my de&s;igns were over-ruled by tho&s;e of the Marquis de Montalt; and I think I may venture to a&s;&s;ert, that my di&s;tre&s;s upon
<PB N="282" REF="284">
this occa&s;ion was, at lea&s;t, equal to your ap|prehen&s;ions."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"She had been much alarmed by the hints he had given her, and by his failing to afford farther information, concer|ning the &s;ubject of her danger; and"&mdash;</Q>She checked the &s;entence that hung upon her lips, for &s;he perceived that &s;he was unwarily betray|ing the intere&s;t he held in her heart. There were a few moments of &s;ilence, and neither party &s;eemed perfectly at ea&s;e. Theodore, at length, renewed the conver&s;ation: <Q REND="inline">"Suffer me to acquaint you,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"with the cir|cum&s;tances that withheld me from the inter|view I &s;olicited; I am anxious to exculpate my&s;elf."</Q> Without waiting her reply, he proceeded to inform her, that the Marquis had, by &s;ome inexplicable means, learned or &s;u&s;|pected the &s;ubject of their la&s;t conver&s;ation, and, perceiving his de&s;igns were in danger of being counteracted, had taken effectual means to prevent her obtaining farther intelligence of them. Adeline immediately recollected that Theodore and her&s;elf had been &s;een in the fo|re&s;t by La Motte, who had, no doubt, &s;u&s;pected their growing intimacy, and had taken care to inform the Marquis how likely he was to find a rival in his friend.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"On the day following that, on which I la&s;t &s;aw you,"</Q> &s;aid Theodore, <Q REND="inline">"the Marquis, who is my colonel, commanded me to pre|pare
<PB N="283" REF="285">
to attend my regiment, and appointed the following morning for my journey. This &s;udden order gave me &s;ome &s;urprize, but I was not long in doubt concerning the motive for it: a &s;ervant of the Marquis, who had been long attached to me, entered my room &s;oon after I had left his Lord, and expre&s;&s;ing concern at my abrupt departure, dropped &s;ome hints re&s;pecting it, which excited my &s;urprize. I inquired farther, and was con|firmed in the &s;u&s;picions I had for &s;ome time entertained of the Marquis's de&s;igns upon you.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Jacques farther informed me, that our late interview had been noticed and communicated to the Marquis. His information had been obtained from a fellow &s;ervant, and it alarmed me &s;o much, than I engaged him to &s;end me intelligence from time to time, concerning the proceedings of the Marquis. I now looked forward to the evening which would bring me again to your pre&s;ence with increa&s;ed impatience: but the ingenuity of the Marquis effectually counteracted my endeavours and wi&s;hes: he had made an engagement to pa&s;s the day at the villa of a nobleman &s;ome leagues di&s;tant, and, notwith&s;tanding all the excu&s;es I could offer, I was obliged to attend him. Thus compelled to obey, I pa&s;&s;ed a day of more agitation and anxiety than I had ever before experienced. It was midnight before
<PB N="284" REF="286">
we returned to the Marquis's chateau. I aro&s;e early in the morning to commence my journey, and re&s;olved to &s;eek an interview with you before I left the province.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"When I entered the breakfa&s;t room, I was much &s;urprized to find the Marquis there al|ready, who, commending the beauty of the morning, declared his intention of accompa|nying me as far as Chineau. Thus unexpec|tedly deprived of my la&s;t hope, my counte|nance, I believe, expre&s;&s;ed what I felt, for the &s;crutinizing eye of the Marquis in&s;tantly changed from &s;eeming carele&s;&s;ne&s;s to di&s;plea|&s;ure. The di&s;tance from Chineau to the ab|bey was, at lea&s;t, twelve leagues; yet I had once &s;ome intention of returning from thence, when the Marquis &s;hould leave me, till I recollected the very remote chance there would even then be of &s;eeing you alone, and al&s;o, that if I was ob&s;erved by La Motte, it would awaken all his &s;u&s;picions, and cau|tion him again&s;t any future plan I might &s;ee it expedient to attempt: I, therefore, pro|ceeded to join my regiment.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Jacques &s;ent me frequent accounts of the operations of the Marquis, but his manner of relating them was &s;o very confu&s;ed, that they only &s;erved to perplex and di&s;tre&s;s me. His la&s;t letter, however, alarmed me &s;o much, that my re&s;idence in quarters became intolera|ble; and, as I found it impo&s;&s;ible to obtain
<PB N="285" REF="287">
leave of ab&s;ence, I &s;ecretly left the regiment, and concealed my&s;elf in a cottage about a mile from the chateau, that I might obtain the earlie&s;t intelligence of the Marquis's plans. Jacques brought me daily information, and, at la&s;t, an account of the horrible plot which was laid for the following night.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;aw little probability of warning you of your danger. If I ventured near the abbey, La Motte might di&s;cover me, and fru&s;trate every attempt on my part to &s;ave you: yet I determined to encounter this ri&s;k for the chance of &s;eeing you, and towards evening I was preparing to &s;et out for the fore&s;t, when Jacques arrived and informed me, that you was to be brought to the chateau. My plan was thus rendered le&s;s difficult. I learned al&s;o, that the Marquis, by means of tho&s;e refinements in luxury, with which he is but too well acquainted, de&s;igned, now that his apprehen&s;ion of lo&s;ing you was no more, to &s;educe you to his wi&s;hes, and impo&s;e upon you by a fictitious marriage. Having ob|tained information concerning the &s;ituation of the room allotted you, I ordered a chai&s;e to be in waiting, and with a de&s;ign of &s;caling your window, and conducting you thence, I entered the garden at midnight."</Q></P>
<P>Theodore having cea&s;ed to &s;peak, <Q REND="inline">"I know not how words can expre&s;s my &s;en&s;e of the obligations I owe you,"</Q> &s;aid Adeline, <Q REND="inline">"or my gratitude for your genero&s;ity."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="288">
<Q REND="inline">"Ah! call it not genero&s;ity,"</Q> he replied, <Q REND="inline">"it was love."</Q> He pau&s;ed. Adeline was &s;ilent. After &s;ome moments of expre&s;&s;ive emotion, he re&s;umed; <Q REND="inline">"But pardon this abrupt declara|tion; yet why do I call it abrupt, &s;ince my actions have already di&s;clo&s;ed what my lips have never, till this in&s;tant, ventured to ac|knowledge."</Q> He pau&s;ed again. Adeline was &s;till &s;ilent. <Q REND="inline">"Yet do me the ju&s;tice to be|lieve, that I am &s;en&s;ible of the impropriety of pleading my love at pre&s;ent, and have been &s;urprized into this confe&s;&s;ion. I promi&s;e al&s;o to forbear from a renewal of the &s;ubject, till you are placed in a &s;ituation, where you may freely accept or refu&s;e, the &s;incere regards I offer you. If I could, however, now be certain that I po&s;&s;e&s;s your e&s;teem, it would relieve me from much anxiety."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline felt &s;urprized that he &s;hould doubt her e&s;teem for him, after the &s;ignal and gene|rous &s;ervice he had rendered her; but &s;he was not yet acquainted with the timidity of love. <Q REND="inline">"Do you then,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, in a tremulous voice, <Q REND="inline">"believe me ungrateful? It is impo&s;&s;ible I can con&s;ider your friendly interference in my be|half without e&s;teeming you."</Q> Theodore im|mediately took her hand and pre&s;&s;ed it to his lips in &s;ilence. They were both too much agitated to conver&s;e, and continued to travel for &s;ome miles without exchanging a word.</P>
