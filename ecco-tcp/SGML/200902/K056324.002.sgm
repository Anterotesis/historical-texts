</ARGUMENT>
<P><MILESTONE N="1692" UNIT="year"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ob&s;ervati|ons.</NOTE> WILLIAM had obtained the crown, through the folly of his predece&s;&s;or. He was now in danger of lo&s;ing it, by his own negligence. Di&s;appointments in their views, had e&s;tranged from him the minds of the Whigs. He di&s;gu&s;ted the Tories with the coldne&s;s of his manner, even when he di&s;tingui&s;hed them mo&s;t with his favour. The di&s;&s;olution of the convention-parliament, had di|mini&s;hed
<PB N="2" REF="13">
the influence of the former, to a degree that offended their pride. They &s;aw a Prince, who had a&s;cended the throne upon their own principles, throw|ing him&s;elf into the hands of their political oppo|nents, from an avowed affection for tho&s;e prerogatives which he was called to circum&s;cribe. The &s;ame con|duct which deprived the King of the attachment of his fir&s;t friends in England, de&s;troyed his intere&s;t with the party which had accompli&s;hed the revolution in Scot|land. In both kingdoms, the &s;eeds of di&s;content had been &s;own with a lavi&s;h hand; and they gradually ro&s;e to maturity, in the progre&s;s of events. The people in general, inflamed by di&s;appointment, mi&s;led by de&s;ign|ing men, or from levity, fond of change, began to &s;how a manife&s;t di&s;like to the behaviour of the King, and the mea&s;ures of the crown. They became jealous of foreigners. They complained of an expen&s;ive war, where victory it&s;elf could produce no advantage to Bri|tain. They murmured again&s;t a &s;tanding army. They repined at the little u&s;e made of the navy, the great and natural bulwark of England.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;con|tents.</NOTE> Though the enemies of William exaggerated his mi&s;managements, it mu&s;t be allowed, that men who judged of cau&s;es by events, had ju&s;t rea&s;on to com|plain. The expences of England, from the landing of the Prince of Orange, on the fith of November 1688, to the twenty-ninth of September 1691, had amounted to near eighteen millions<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">MS. 1691. Journals pa&s;&s;im.</NOTE>. Be&s;ides, great arrears were owing to the army in Ireland, the navy was de&s;titute of &s;tores, and the &s;hips were out of re|pair. The &s;ervice done in the intermediate time, ex|clu&s;ive of the change made in the per&s;on of the Mo|narch, was far from being adequate to that enormous &s;um. The war in Ireland had been at fir&s;t &s;trangely neglected. It was afterwards pro&s;ecuted with little judgment, and it terminated in no honour. The inha|bitants of a few pari&s;hes in the Highlands of Scotland, without any aid from abroad, and de&s;titute of the means of war at home, remained in arms again&s;t the King, for more than two years. They had once to|tally defeated his army in the field. The checks which
<PB N="3" REF="14">
they had received, were neither &s;plendid nor deci&s;ive; and he owed the pacification which en&s;ued, to the in|fluence of his rival, and his own money<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">MS. 1691.</NOTE>, and not to the terror of his power. England had been, in the mean time, wounded in her pride. Her fleet had been twice defeated. Her enemy rode in triumph in the channel. Her coa&s;ts were in&s;ulted. She was left naked of troops, and expo&s;ed to inva&s;ion<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Nottingham to William, 1690.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Secret in|trigues</NOTE> But William ought not, in common fairne&s;s, to be blamed for all the&s;e misfortunes. He reigned over a divided people. His title was di&s;puted by one party. He lo&s;t the other, by not yielding to their claims upon his exclu&s;ive favour. His rival, in the mean time, &s;upported by a powerful Monarch, either maintained war again&s;t him, within his kingdoms, or hovered over the coa&s;t, with threatened inva&s;ions.

James po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his native &s;ubjects an army almo&s;t equal to the purpo&s;e of the expedition. The tran&s;ports which had carried to Ireland five thou&s;and French, in the year 1690, had brought back to France as many Iri&s;h. The Engli&s;h government had been at the expence of &s;ending fourteen thou&s;and more troops to James, after the capitulation of Limeric.

He had, even then, &s;ufficient time to carry his army to England, before the junction of Ru&s;&s;el with the Dutch-fleet. Be&s;ides that officer continued his corre&s;pondence, and a&s;&s;ured him of his firm intention to &s;erve his cau&s;e. He propo&s;ed one of two alternatives.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A place-bill rejected by the lords.</NOTE> Though this facility in giving money, has been a&s;cribed to &s;ome corrupt practices of the court, it may be ju&s;tified from the urgent &s;tate of the times. The people were plunged in a war, from which they could not immediately extricate them&s;elves, by land, either with honour or with &s;afety. To remit in preparations by &s;ea, might have encouraged an inva&s;ion. The commons, in other re&s;pects, &s;hewed little complai|&s;ance for the crown. They even appeared to be &s;elf-denied, with regard to the private intere&s;t of their own members. They introduced and pa&s;&s;ed a bill, touching free and impartial proceedings in parliament, which excluded, from the right of &s;itting in the hou&s;e, all per&s;ons, who &s;hould accept of any office from the crown. The mini&s;try found them&s;elves incapable of oppo&s;ing, in the lower hou&s;e, a mea&s;ure &s;o popular.

They were generous in their &s;upplies, and, perhaps, rather profu&s;e, with regard to the mo|ney of the &s;ubject. A great majority were Tories, men in general le&s;s attached to the family of a prince, than to the power of the crown. The Earl of Not|tingham and others of their own party had opened a channel of connexion between them and the reigning King.

That kingdom, ever &s;ince its reduction in 1691, had exhibited one continued &s;cene of oppre&s;&s;ion, inju&s;tice, and public mi&s;ery. The government of James, with all its di&s;advantages, his own bigotry, the in&s;olence of the papi&s;ts, combined with the fears of the prote&s;tants, were all more tolerable than the admini&s;|tration of William, ever &s;ince the &s;urrender of Lime|rick.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The grie|vances of that king|dom</NOTE> On the third of March 1692, the Lord Vi&s;count Sidney was rai&s;ed to the government of Ireland. But he arrived not in that kingdom, till the twenty-fifth of the following Augu&s;t. Coning&s;by, created a Baron by the &s;ame name, with his colleague Porter, conti|nued in the government, in the intermediate time. They pre&s;ided in the court of claims, for adju&s;ting the demands of tho&s;e comprehended in the articles of Limerick; and the obvious road to their ju&s;tice, was &s;aid to lie through their avarice. The arrival of Sid|ney in his government, though it might le&s;&s;en the fear of future oppre&s;&s;ions, dimini&s;hed not the re&s;entment of the people for former injuries. His own conduct &s;eem|ed more calculated to pre&s;erve the prerogative of the crown, than to redre&s;s the grievances of the &s;ubject. His &s;peech, at the opening of the parliament, was &s;uited to the times, and well received. But the me|mory of the pa&s;t, created an ill humour among the commons. Seventy thou&s;and pounds had been de|manded, as an additional revenue, for the annual and

nece&s;&s;ary expences of government. But the hou&s;e were either &s;low in finding the ways and means, or ignorant where they could be found. Two bills, rea|dy drawn, the one for an additional exci&s;e on malt liquors, the other for a tax on land bearing corn, were &s;ent down from the Iri&s;h privy council. The com|mons were highly offended at the manner of introduc|ing the&s;e bills, which were in them&s;elves, e&s;pecially the latter, highly exceptionable; and in &s;ome degree, partial and unju&s;t. They argued, that though, by Poyning's law, no bill was to be pa&s;&s;ed, without the &s;anction of the Engli&s;h privy council, it was never deemed that the Iri&s;h commons were precluded from taxing them&s;elves<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Journals, pa&s;&s;ion.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">laid before the Engli&s;h parliament.</NOTE> The nece&s;&s;ities of government induced the lord-lieu|tenant to hearken to a compromi&s;e. The commons con&s;ented to pa&s;s the exci&s;e bill, with a declaration, that the thing &s;hould not be drawn into a precedent. But they rejected the land-bill, as laying an unequal tax upon the farmers. When Sidney found him&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the additional exci&s;e, he gave vent to his re&s;entment again&s;t the parliament. He &s;ent for them, on the fourth of November<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">1692.</NOTE>. He re|primanded them &s;everely, for invading the preroga|tives of the Crown. He prorogued them to the &s;ix|teenth of April. Inflamed with what they deemed a public in&s;ult, offended at &s;ome private expre&s;&s;ions of indignation from the lord-lieutenant, &s;everal members of the Iri&s;h hou&s;e of commons came, in the name of their country, to England, to lay their grievances be|fore the parliament. On the twenty-fourth of Fe|bruary, they laid their complaints, in writing, before the Engli&s;h commons. The lords, at the &s;ame time, took cognizance of the affair, and examined witne&s;&s;es. Some circum&s;tances appeared, upon the inquiry, which &s;erved to heighten the mi&s;managements of govern|ment, as well as the real grievances of Ireland. The army, in want of pay from the Crown, rai&s;ed money by military di&s;tre&s;s, from the &s;ubject, to the incredible

The &s;tores left by James in the kingdom, to the value, it was &s;aid, of eighty thou&s;and pounds, were embez|zled or applied to his own u&s;e by Coning&s;by. The lord-lieutenant him&s;elf, and Ginckle, who had been created Earl of Athlone, were accu&s;ed of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them&s;elves of almo&s;t all the forfeitures which ought to have fallen to the public<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">Ibid. pa&s;&s;im.</NOTE>.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A remon|&s;trance on that &s;ubject.</NOTE> The lords pre&s;ented an addre&s;s, upon the &s;ubject of the Iri&s;h complaints. The commons &s;ent a remon|&s;trance to the throne. To the grievances already &s;pe|cified, the latter added &s;everal others of the &s;ame a|larming kind. They complained of the mi&s;eries of free quarters, and the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the army, to which the Prote&s;tant &s;ubjects had been expo&s;ed. They repre&s;ented the danger of recruiting the troops, as had been notoriou&s;ly done, with Iri&s;h Papi&s;ts; and &s;uch per&s;ons as had been in open rebellion. They averred, that the common cour&s;e of law was &s;topt, by granting protections to Roman Catholics, not comprehended within the articles of pacification; and that it was from the mercenary views of the &s;ervants of the Crown, that the impolitic addition was made to the treaty with the Papi&s;ts, at the &s;urrender of Limerick. All the&s;e grievances they reque&s;ted the King to redre&s;s; and he promi&s;ed to rectify all that had been ami&s;s in Ireland. The mi&s;eries of that kingdom might, perhaps, have been exaggerated. The expectations of the Prote&s;t|ants were high, from the &s;ucce&s;s of their party. The claims of the Papi&s;ts were exten&s;ive, from the favour|able articles by which they had fini&s;hed the war. Re|cent injuries were added, on both &s;ides, to ancient prejudices and animo&s;ities. To &s;atisfy either, was certainly a thing difficult for any government. But it is equally certain, that the &s;ervants of the Crown were much le&s;s attentive to the happine&s;s of the people,

When the King of France had re&s;olved to tran&s;port an army into England, under the conduct of James, before the affair of La Hogue, the Scotti&s;h expedition was not relinqui&s;hed. Two frigates, with officers, &s;tores, arms, and a &s;mall &s;um of money, were to &s;ail from Ambleteu&s;e, when the main fleet were to put to &s;ea. The defeat of Tourville broke this, as well as all the other mea&s;ures of the late King. His attention afterwards was chiefly turned to England. The Earls of Arran and Breadalbin, and Sir James Montgomery, were the only per&s;ons of rank in Scotland, who held any corre&s;pondence with the court of St. Germains; though the greate&s;t part, by far, of the gentry of the kingdom were in the intere&s;t of the late King<NOTE N="W" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, pa&s;&s;im.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ob&s;equiou&s;|ne&s;s of its parliament</NOTE> The unexpected blow &s;u&s;tained by the French at La Hogue, and the con&s;equent di&s;appointment of James, threw a damp on his adherents throughout the re&s;t of the year. The nation in general &s;hewed a manife&s;t im|patience under the government of William. But tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed that Prince the mo&s;t, covered, under &s;pecious complaints of grievances, their attachment to his rival. The King, by the advice of &s;ecretary John|&s;ton, managed his affairs with prudence. He gained, by promoting their leaders, the Pre&s;byterians. He reconciled the Duke of Hamilton and his party to his government, by appointing that nobleman commi&s;&s;i|oner to the approaching parliament. On the eighteenth of April, in the pre&s;ent year, a parliament met at Edinburgh. To flatter the pride of the Scots, the King &s;ignified in his letter, that ever &s;ince his coming to the Crown, he had been fully re&s;olved to hold a par|liament, in per&s;on, in his ancient kingdom.

To defray the charges of this body of men, and to aid the other expences of government, they granted a &s;upply of one hundred and fourteen thou&s;and pounds &s;terling.

It was dated at St. Germains, on the &s;eventeenth of April<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">April 17, N. S.</NOTE>. He promi&s;ed an unlimited pardon to all his &s;ubjects, an ab&s;olute oblivion of all the pa&s;t. He declared, that he would immediately call a parliament, inform him&s;elf, through them, of the inclinations of his people, and re|dre&s;s, by their concurrence, former grievances, and give every &s;ecurity for their future happine&s;s. He promi&s;ed to protect the church of England; to &s;ecure to its mem|bers all the churches, univer&s;ities, colleges, and &s;chools; to confirm their immunities, rights, and pri|vileges. He pledged his word to recommend to his parliament an impartial liberty of con&s;cience. He de|clared, that he would never violate the te&s;t, and that he would leave the di&s;pen&s;ing power of the crown, in other matters, to be explained and limited by the re|pre&s;entatives of the nation. He &s;olemnly promi&s;ed to give his a&s;&s;ent to all &s;uch bills as &s;hould be found nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;horten the duration of parliaments, to &s;ecure the freedom of elections, the fair returns of members, and impartial trials.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">to the peo|ple of Eng|land.</NOTE> To regain the favour of tho&s;e who had been mo&s;t active in the late revolution, he engaged him&s;elf to ratify and confirm all &s;uch laws, during the govern|ment of William, as &s;hould be tendered to him by his parliament. He declared his willingne&s;s to re-e&s;tabli&s;h, in the mo&s;t ample manner, the act of &s;et|tlement of Ireland, as pa&s;&s;ed in his brother's reign; to relinqui&s;h the chimney-money, or any other part of the revenue, as &s;hould be deemed burden&s;ome to the people, for any other more ea&s;y a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment.

To remove the apprehen&s;i|ons
<PB N="36" REF="49">
of his &s;ubjects, that great &s;ums might be de|manded by France, he po&s;itively a&s;&s;ured them, that his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty expected no compen&s;ation, but the glory of having &s;uccoured an injured Prince. He added, that he was on the eve of coming to vindi|cate his own right, and to e&s;tabli&s;h the liberties of his people; and he concluded with &s;olemnly praying, that God might &s;o give him &s;ucce&s;s, in the pro&s;ecution of the one, as he was &s;incere in his intentions to confirm the other<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">Printed Declaration.</NOTE>.</P>

But when he offered &s;ufficient bail, he was, by a fre&s;h warrant, continued in pri&s;on for high trea&s;on. On the trial of this un|fortunate per&s;on, no po&s;itive evidence of guilt ap|peared. Though the &s;tatute of trea&s;on allowed no conjectural pre&s;umptions, no &s;trained inferences, no forced con&s;tructions, he was at length condemned. Treby, lord-chief-ju&s;tice of the common pleas, and formerly a vehement patriot, pre&s;ided at his trial; and was &s;aid to have even &s;urpa&s;&s;ed Jefferys him&s;elf, in vio|lence, upon this occa&s;ion. He brow-beat the pri&s;oner. He rejected, without any an&s;wer, his defence. He revil|ed and threatened the jury, when they &s;eemed to lean to the favourable &s;ide. The novelty of Anderton's ca&s;e, being the fir&s;t who had ever &s;uffered death for print|ing, rai&s;ed the attention of the public.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Campaign in Flanders.</NOTE> The King, impatient to open the campaign in Flan|ders, left Ken&s;ington, on the thirty-fir&s;t of March, and arrived in the Mae&s;e, on the &s;econd of April. The French had di&s;turbed the winter it&s;elf, with mi|litary excur&s;ions and attacks. They had taken Furnes and Dixmuyde, in the end of November, with their garri&s;ons, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of the Engli&s;h who had re|duced tho&s;e places, in the clo&s;e of the preceding cam|paign. His own preparations, the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ettling, previou&s;ly, the councils of the Allies, and the difficul|ty of a&s;&s;embling the forces, detained the King at Loo and the Hague, till the middle of May. Having join|ed the troops of the Allies at Deigham, he marched from thence to Parks, near Louvaine; and, by that judicious po&s;ition, is &s;aid to have broken the de&s;igns of France upon Brabant. Lewis the Fourteenth with an equipage more &s;uitable to a triumph than a cam|paign, joined his army, con&s;i&s;ting of one hundred thou&s;and men, on the &s;econd of June. Mae&s;tricht, Charleroy, Huy, Bru&s;&s;els and Liege, dreaded by turns the fall of the &s;torm. But the French King having fallen &s;ick, &s;oon after his arrival, returned to Ver&s;ailles, and left to the Mare&s;chal de Luxembourg the conduct of military operations in Flanders. Luxembourg, on the fifteenth of June, placed his head quarters at Mel|dert, within half a league of the camp of the Allies. The two armies continued in this &s;ituation above a month. Each endeavoured to find an opportunity of giving battle to advantage; while both &s;uffered great hard&s;hips from the ince&s;&s;ant rains.</P>

being determined to attack them in their camp, or if they retreated to fall upon their rear. His van was in &s;ight, before they were appri&s;ed of his march. The King made the nece&s;&s;ary preparations for receiving the enemy with vigour. He &s;ent away his heavy baggage. He ordered his infantry to intrench them&s;elves in the front of his camp. The river Geette bounded his right, and ran, winding, along his rear. On the left, and in the front of the left, was the brook of Landen. A thick hedge joining with one end, the Geete covered part of the front of his right wing. The village of Neerwinden, with entrenchments before it, was &s;ituated between the left end of the hedge and the center. The village of Rom&s;dorff &s;tood farther ad|vanced, oppo&s;ed to the front of the left wing; and the entrenchment before it &s;tretched to the rivulet of Lan|den. A line of entrenchments extended them&s;elves be|hind the two villages; and behind the&s;e, the army of the Allies was formed. Their whole front was cover|ed with one hundred pieces of cannon; which by be|ing advantageou&s;ly placed, on an eminence, command|ed all the approaches to their line<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Feuquieres.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and defeat Willam</NOTE> On the evening<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">July 28.</NOTE> of his arrival in &s;ight of the Allies, the Mare&s;chal de Luxembourg di&s;lodged a de|tachment of the enemy po&s;ted in the village of Lan|den, which &s;tood advanced before the brook of that name. Between this village and that of Romfdorff, he placed forty battalions, in the night. He formed his center of eight lines of hor&s;e and foot intermixed. His hor&s;e, on the left wing, were ordered to extend them&s;elves to the Geette, oppo&s;ing their line to the thick hedge which covered the front of the enemy's right. The French were formed before five in the morning, and the cannonading began on both &s;ides. Six brigades, under the Duke of Berwick and two other lieutenant generals, attacked the village of Neer|winden. This important po&s;t was carried. But it was &s;oon recovered by the vigilance of William; who had the good fortune, at the &s;ame in&s;tant, to &s;ee his enemies repul&s;ed on every &s;ide. The center of the

French army was not properly &s;u&s;tained by either wing. But the Mare&s;chal de Luxembourg was not to be intimidated. He made a &s;econd effort on Neer|winden. He &s;ucceeded. He was again repul&s;ed. He re&s;olved to attack &s;ome other quarter of the enemy. They were inacce&s;&s;ible every where. The village of Neerwinden is a third time attacked. William, with great bravery, led twice the Engli&s;h infantry to the entrenchment, which the enemy endeavoured to force. Nothing, however could re&s;i&s;t the impetuo&s;ity of the French. Their center, reinforced by their right, opened a way for their cavalry into the very lines of the Allies. They flanked the Engli&s;h. They charg|ed and put to flight the troops of Hanover. They overturned and routed the Spaniards<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">William's account. Gazettes.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">at Landen.</NOTE> William perceiving this di&s;order, advanced &s;udden|ly with a part of his left wing. But the enemy gave him no time to form. They flanked the Dutch hor&s;e, as they came. They broke them, in a furious on&s;et, before the Engli&s;h could draw into a line. The King, however, was not to be driven from the field. He ordered his troops to charge as they found them&s;elves. His efforts were attended with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s, when he perceived his right wing driven headlong into the Geete. Nothing but confu&s;ion could now be &s;een throughout the camp. Slaughter and flight prevailed every where, on the field. The bridge being too much crowded by the runaways, many were drowned in the river. Wil|liam retreated, in the &s;ame order, with the remains of the left wing. He, however, left a complete vic|tory to the enemy. Sixty-&s;ix pieces of cannon, eight mortars, eighty &s;tandards, colours, and other trophies fell into the hands of the French. Twelve thou&s;and of the Allies lay dead in this bloody field. Two thou&s;and were made pri&s;oners. The Mare&s;chal de Luxembourg gained little but glory from the battle of Landen. He lo&s;t eight thou&s;and of his be&s;t troops, in the action; and his army was &s;o much weakened,

He had detached a con&s;iderable num|ber of his troops, under the Duke of Wertemberg. He had &s;ent a reinforcement to the garri&s;on of Liege<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Feuquieres.</NOTE>. In point of numbers, he was much in|ferior to Luxembourg. He had &s;ufficient time to re|treat beyond the Geette, and cover him&s;elf from in|&s;ult behind that river<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. His po&s;t, however, was &s;o &s;trong, that his officers encouraged him to fight; and he him&s;elf was extremely anxious to recover the laurels which he had lo&s;t in the preceding campaign. Six weeks of inactivity &s;ucceeded the battle. Both &s;ides, weakened by their lo&s;&s;es, &s;eemed unwilling to grapple again in the field. The Mare&s;chal de Lux|embourg, being at length reinforced, by detachments from the coa&s;ts of Picardy and Normandy, as well as from the army on the upper Rhine, moved toward Charleroy. He &s;at down before that place, on the eleventh of September. William made no efforts to rai&s;e the &s;iege. The garri&s;on behaved them&s;elves with &s;uch &s;pirit as de&s;erved relief.

The county of Somer&s;et, the &s;eat of Monmouth's rebellion and Jefferys's cruelties, was now ready to receive him with open arms. The town of Taunton it&s;elf, that had &s;uffered &s;o much eight years before, for oppo&s;ing James, expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t affection for his per&s;on and the warme&s;t zeal for his re&s;toration. The legal &s;everities of the year 1685 mu&s;t, therefore, have been exaggerated; or the people acquitted the King of the rigorous conduct of his &s;ervants. The Lord Powlet, and the majority of the gentlemen of the county, to|gether with the citizens of Taunton, &s;olemnly engag|ed them&s;elves to James, to ri&s;e in his cau&s;e. Even individuals were as un&s;teady to their former principles, as bodies of men.

Having, with his u&s;ual addre&s;s, convinced the adhe|rents of King James of the &s;incerity of his repentance, he wrote a letter full of contrition for his pa&s;t con|duct, to that Prince. He told him, that a de&s;cent, with a competent force, was the only means of fini&s;h|ing the misfortunes of the King, and the mi&s;eries of the nation.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings of the com|mons.</NOTE> Many in the lower hou&s;e were attached to the late King. But the majority, though tories in principle, had uniformly &s;upported the cau&s;e of William. The people, di&s;couraged with repeated misfortunes, and feeling the weight of the war on every branch of their commerce, were loud in demanding peace. Some of the Tory-leaders in office, particularly the Earl of Nottingham, joined the voice of the people. Others of the &s;ame party &s;acrificed their opinion to their intere&s;t; and adhered to the court. A di&s;pute aro&s;e in the hou&s;e, whether the mi&s;carriages of the fleet, or the &s;upply, &s;hould be the fir&s;t object of their con&s;ideration. The que&s;tion was carried for the latter, after a &s;eries of debates, which continued &s;ix days. On the thirteenth of November, the hou&s;e unani|mou&s;ly re&s;olved to &s;upport their Maje&s;ties, and their government, to their utmo&s;t power.

Tho&s;e who &s;erved in the army, were in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s for money. More than one million of the wages of the &s;eamen, without any funds, remained unpaid. Though the greate&s;t &s;everities were u&s;ed, the &s;ailors, in their di&s;tre&s;s, became mutinous for want of pay. The fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s, therefore, of the commons, was to grant four hundred thou&s;and pounds, by way of advance, to remove immediately a part of that grievance. This &s;um was to be rai&s;ed on the ge|neral credit of the exchequer, upon the promi&s;e of the commons to repay it with intere&s;t, after the rate of &s;even per cent, under a caution, that this proceed|ing &s;hould form no precedent<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Journals.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">They grant large &s;up|plies.</NOTE> WITH equal alacrity the commons entered upon the great bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;upply. Upon the general e&s;ti|mates of the navy and army, they granted five milli|ons, for the &s;ervice of the following year. Forty thou&s;and &s;eamen, including two regiments of marines, were required by government, and voted by the hou&s;e.

Be&s;ides a provi&s;ion made for paying all wages due to &s;eamen, more than four hundred thou|&s;and pounds were voted, for making up the deficien|cies in the grants of the preceding year. It was much more ea&s;y to grant the &s;upplies in general, than to find particular funds, upon which they might be laid. The commons began with a land-tax. Four &s;hillings in the pound were carried, as &s;oon as propo&s;ed<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">Dec. 21. Dec. 29.</NOTE>. The deficiencies of the la&s;t year were to be defrayed from this ready fund. The &s;econd money bill was a &s;upplement to the million annuity act of the year 1692. Near one hundred and twenty thou&s;and pounds were &s;till deficient; though fourteen per cent, had been al|lowed. Some appropriations of exci&s;e duties were made for this purpo&s;e. The fir&s;t lottery, and the bank of England, were two remarkable money-bills, in the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament. One million was rai&s;ed by means of the fir&s;t; and one million five hun|dred thou&s;and pounds by the &s;econd. Still the ways and means fell &s;hort of the money wanted.

The facility with which it &s;lipt through both hou&s;es, proceeded probably from the certainty that it was to be rejected by the King. The commons had become unpopular, through the va&s;t &s;ums which they had granted for &s;upporting an inglorious war. To re|gain their credit with their con&s;tituents, they fram|ed the place-bill.

Though the com|mons, in all appearance, would have been much di&s;|appointed, had the place-bill pa&s;&s;ed into a law; they remon&s;trated again&s;t the conduct of the King. They voted, that whoever had advi&s;ed the refu&s;al of the royal a&s;&s;ent to the act touching free and impartial pro|ceedings in parliament, was an enemy to their Maje&s;|ties and the kingdom. The King's an&s;wer was &s;ooth|ing, but nothing to the purpo&s;e.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">of the two hou&s;es</NOTE> THE affairs of the Ea&s;t-India company, which had already employed &s;o much of the attention of parlia|ment, produced undeci&s;ive debates in the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;i|on. The train of corruption, which &s;oon after broke forth in &s;uch di&s;graceful di&s;coveries, had been already laid. The complicated nature of the bu&s;ine&s;s, and the violent oppo&s;ition of the merchants, prevented the friends of the company from making an immediate re|turn for the favours which they had de&s;ired to receive. A bill for a general naturalization of all foreign Prote&s;|tants, created violent debates in the hou&s;e of com|mons. Tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed it, called the prejudices of the populace to the aid of their cau&s;e.

The Earl of Bellamont impeached them both, in the hou&s;e of commons. The articles again&s;t Con|ing&s;by contained charges of the blacke&s;t kind. The accu&s;ation again&s;t Porter, was &s;carce le&s;s &s;evere. Bel|lamont &s;upported, with vouchers, every charge. The commons &s;eemed convinced of the guilt. But they declined to ground upon them an impeachment. The rea&s;on which they a&s;&s;igned, was plau&s;ible if not &s;uffi|cient.

Her great exertions had impoveri&s;hed her &s;ubjects, by enormous taxes and impo&s;ts. An ear|ne&s;t de&s;ire for peace prevailed throughout the kingdom. Pa&s;t di&s;appointments, and the fear of future misfor|tunes, had abated the ambition of the King. He had lo&s;t his be&s;t generals in the cour&s;e of the war; and a great part of the reputation of his arms, in the pre|ceding campaign. A deficiency in re&s;ources deprived him of every hope of making any &s;ucce&s;sful efforts in the pre&s;ent year. He had even &s;ome rea&s;on to fear, he could not retain what he had already gained; and

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and de&s;ire of peace.</NOTE> In the mid&s;t of mea&s;ures for &s;upporting the war with vigour, the French King thought &s;eriou&s;ly of means to obtain peace. He endeavoured, in the preceding year, through the channel of Denmark and Sweden to negociate a treaty for the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the tranquillity of Europe. He had, in &s;ome mea&s;ure agreed to a preliminary of the Imperial court, that the affair of England &s;hould be &s;ettled to the &s;atisfaction of the Prince of Orange.

But he joined not his troops till the &s;ixth of June. The French had taken the field, with two armies. One, under Mare&s;chal de Villeroi, was po&s;ted be|tween Mechlen and Deyn&s;e. The Mare&s;chal de Boufflers commanded another, between Flerus and Sombref. The King oppo&s;ed, in per&s;on, the enemy at Mariekirke, with one army. The Elector of Ba|varia a&s;&s;embled another in the neighbourhood of Lou|vain. The whole &s;ummer either pa&s;&s;ed in inaction, or was wa&s;ted in motions, which neither promi&s;ed nor produced any important event. Though no congre&s;s was opened, the expectations of peace &s;u&s;pended the operations of war. The allies were in no condition to pu&s;h, with vigour, the advantages which they had ob|tained in the preceding campaign; and France, in her pre&s;ent condition, con&s;idered her being able to protect her conque&s;ts, an advantage equal to the glory of a victory.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Operations on the &s;ide of Spain.</NOTE> To avail him&s;elf of the weakne&s;s of Spain, the French King bent his principal efforts towards that &s;ide. A di&s;pute with the Court of Madrid, on ac|count of a Jew, who had &s;erved him in quality of an agent, had contributed to induce William to withdraw all the naval force of the Engli&s;h from the Mediterra|nean. But the French, having ordered the &s;quadron at Toulon to fail into the ocean, were incapable of in&s;ulting the coa&s;t of Spain, though expo&s;ed. They, however, pu&s;hed with &s;ome vigour their operations by land. The Duke de Vend&ocirc;me, who commanded in Catalonia, was ordered to take the field. He pa&s;&s;ed the Ter, on the the thirtieth of May. He attacked the Prince of He&s;&s;e Darm&s;tadt, on the banks of that river, and forced him to retire with lo&s;s under the cannon of O&s;talric.

The efforts of the maritime powers at &s;ea, were as languid and undeci&s;ive as their operations by land. Sir George Rooke, upon his return from Cadiz, where he had wintered with his &s;quadron, was appointed commander in chief of the combined fleet. Having, in vain, endeavoured to intercept the French fleet, upon its way from Toulon to Bre&s;t, he returned to Torbay, on the twenty-third of May, and he was re-called by the lords of the regency from his command.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Advances toward a peace.</NOTE> The defection of the Duke of Savoy, while it much offended all the confederates, rendered the maritime powers, in particular, very de&s;irous of peace. William had various rea&s;ons to wi&s;h for an immediate pacification with France. The failure of the land|bank, on which he had &s;o much credit, the con&s;equent difficulty of pre&s;ent remittances, the uncertainty of future &s;upplies, the example of Savoy, for further de&s;ertions from the common cau&s;e, the di&s;po&s;ition of the States again&s;t the continuance of a burden&s;ome war, the clamours of the Engli&s;h, under their heavy taxes, all combined to make the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the tranquility of Europe an object of importance to the King. He, therefore, pro&s;ecuted with &s;incerity every mea&s;ure to accompli&s;h his views. He concurred with the States, in appointing Dykveldt to confer with Callieres, who had, for &s;ome time, carried on in Holland &s;ecret negociations leading to a peace. On the twenty-fourth of Augu&s;t, Dykveldt communicated the whole proceedings to the deputies of the States for foreign affairs.

To pre|&s;erve, or, at lea&s;t, to prolong his life, he fell upon the expedient of obtaining a pardon, as a price of di&s;|coveries to the King. Through the means of the Duke of Devon&s;hire, he conveyed a paper to William, when he was in Flanders, containing an account of corre&s;pondences and intrigues, carried on with the court of St. Germains, by the Duke of Shrew&s;bury, the Earls of Bath and Marlborough, the Lord Godol|phin, and Admiral Ru&s;&s;el.

His trial, however, was delayed, by various means, till the King's arrival in England.

The deliverance of the nation was not, however, the &s;ole object of this Prince. Like other men, he was &s;ubject to human pa&s;&s;ions; and, like them, when he could gratify him|&s;elf, he &s;erved the world. Various motives &s;eem to have concurred, to induce him to adopt a mea&s;ure, unaccountable on other grounds. The projected peace was to &s;ecure the crown in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for his life. He had no children, and but few relations; and tho&s;e he never loved. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ors provided by the act of &s;ettlement, he either de&s;pi&s;ed or abhorred; and he &s;eems hitherto not to have extended his views beyond the limits of that act.

That one might be &s;wayed by an affection for the late King, another gained with French money. They de&s;cended to all the inconveniencies, ari&s;ing from &s;tanding armies.

But that, in&s;tead of adhering to his &s;olemn engage|ments, he &s;till retained a great number of aliens about his per&s;on.

The Duke on the other hand, had &s;trengthened his intere&s;t by a marriage with the Prince&s;s-Royal of Sweden.

Though the &s;ame power which conferred on the Prince&s;s the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Crown, might, with equal ju&s;tice, have placed any other per|&s;on on the throne, the parliament cho&s;e to adhere, in &s;ome degree, to the royal blood, as committing the lea&s;t outrage on monarchy, to which a majority of them&s;elves were attached from principle.

But the influence ari&s;ing from the di&s;po&s;al of an immen&s;e revenue, had, even then, placed the power of the Sovereign on a much more &s;olid foundation, than the &s;eeble prerogative derived, by hereditary princes, from the opinion of the people.</P>

combining with an indifference about humouring man|kind through their ruling pa&s;&s;ions, rendered him ex|tremely unfit for gaining the affections of the Engli&s;h nation.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His public conduct.</NOTE> The&s;e har&s;h features of the mind of King William pre&s;ented them&s;elves only to tho&s;e who took a near and critical view of his conduct.

The two hou&s;es of parlia|ment,
<PB N="213" REF="228">
as &s;oon as the death of the late King was made known, a&s;&s;embled; and unanimou&s;ly congratulated the Queen upon her acce&s;&s;ion. To the privy council, who met at the &s;ame time, &s;he made the cu&s;tomary declaration; and ordered all the Lords and others, who had &s;erved the late King in council, to take the oaths to her&s;elf in the &s;ame capacity. <NOTE PLACE="marg">March 8.</NOTE> She was proclaimed in the afternoon of the eighth of March, with the u&s;ual &s;olemnity, amid&s;t the applau&s;e of the populace. The two &s;ucceeding days were employed in receiving the addre&s;&s;es of the two hou&s;es of parliament, the fe|licitations of the church, and the congratulations of the city of London. The late king, unpopular while he lived, was almo&s;t forgot as &s;oon as dead; and the people, with their u&s;ual eagerne&s;s for novelty, turned all their thoughts toward the fir&s;t mea&s;ures of the new reign.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">State of par|ties.</NOTE> Though the late King had no rea&s;on to be plea&s;ed with either of the two parties who had divided be|tween them the nation, he had, &s;ome months before his death, thrown him&s;elf and his affairs into the hands of the Whigs. The hopes derived by the Tories from the declining &s;tate of his health, had prevented that violence, which they might have otherwi&s;e ex|hibited in parliament, on account of their being ex|cluded from power. The unanimity in the two hou&s;es, with regard to foreign affairs, proceeded, probably, from the &s;ame cau&s;e. The Whigs could deny nothing to the Crown, as their leaders were in office; and the Tories were not aver&s;e to a war, which they them|&s;elves were &s;ure to manage, after the expected demi&s;e of the King. The two parties had pledged them&s;elves too far to retreat from their engagements; and, there|fore, though a change of mini&s;try was naturally to be expected, from the acce&s;&s;ion of a Prince&s;s, whom the coldne&s;s of her predece&s;&s;or, and the di&s;re&s;pectful con|duct of the party now in power, had evidently thrown into the arms of the Tories, there was no rea&s;on to apprehend any change in the great line of the mea&s;ures of government.</P>

from tho&s;e of her predece&s;&s;or in the throne. Though &s;he paid a compliment to his memory in the beginning, &s;he concluded with a kind of cen&s;ure upon his conduct. She a&s;&s;ured the two hou&s;es, that as her own heart was entirely Engli&s;h, &s;he would agree to every thing that they could either expect or de&s;ire for the happine&s;s and pro&s;perity of England. The expre&s;|&s;ion manife&s;tly regarded the too great attachment to his own countrymen, for which King William had been blamed. But to this allu&s;ion to the predilection of the late King for foreigners, &s;he added words that &s;eemed highly to reflect on his moral conduct. In confirmation of her promi&s;e to both hou&s;es, &s;he a&s;&s;ured them, that they would always find HER a &s;trict and religious ob&s;erver of her word. The fir&s;t part of the Queen's &s;peech contained the u&s;ual a&s;&s;urances of a new reign. She agreed, &s;he &s;aid, in &s;entiments with with the concurrent addre&s;&s;es of the two hou&s;es, that too much could not be done for the allies, to reduce the exorbitant power of France. She recommended an union with Scotland, as nece&s;&s;ary for the peace and &s;ecurity of both kingdoms; and &s;he de&s;ired that the revenue for the &s;upport of the civil government, &s;hould be renewed in a manner &s;uitable to her own honour and the dignity of the Crown<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Journals, March 11, 1702.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings of the com|mons.</NOTE> Though the Queen was at no pains to conceal her attachment to one party, the other could not oppo&s;e her mea&s;ures in parliament without de&s;erting their own.

between England and Scotland. Provi&s;ion had been already made, for the eventual expence of a war, during the &s;ucceeding &s;ummer; and the Queen, in|&s;tead of demanding &s;upplies from the nation, found an opportunity of alleviating a part of their burden. When &s;he came to the hou&s;e of lords, on the thirtieth of March, to give the royal a&s;&s;ent to the bill for the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of her own revenue, &s;he made a &s;peech from the throne, calculated to gain popularity. She told the two hou&s;es, that though the funds for the ci|vil li&s;t, might greatly fall &s;hort of what they formerly produced, &s;he would give directions, that one hundred thou&s;and pounds of her own revenue &s;hould be applied to the public &s;ervice of the year<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">Journals, March 30.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen engages to &s;upport the allies.</NOTE> While Anne was rendering her&s;elf popular at home, &s;he gained the e&s;teem of her allies abroad, by &s;hewing a warm zeal for their cau&s;e. Two days after the death of William, &s;he condoled with the States of the Uuited Provinces upon that event, in a letter. She a&s;&s;ured them, that as &s;he had &s;ucceeded the late King in his throne, &s;he would al&s;o &s;ucceed him in the &s;ame inclination, to a con&s;tant union and amity with their republic, as well as adherence to the late alliances. That &s;he would concur with the allies in general, in mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of the common liberty of Europe, in reducing the power of France within proper bounds. That &s;he &s;hould always look upon the intere&s;t of England and tho&s;e of the States as in&s;eparable, and united with &s;uch ties as could not be broken, without the greate&s;t prejudice to the two nations. The Earl of Marlborough was probably the advi&s;er of mea&s;ures, which he afterwards executed with ability. The attachment which this nobleman had uniformly &s;hewn to the Queen, when &s;he was little re&s;pected by the nation and per&s;ecuted by the court, had either excited &s;entiments of gratitude or created principles of obedience to his inclinations in her mind. The fir&s;t honours, and even the fir&s;t con&s;idera|ble office, conferred in the pre&s;ent reign, were be&s;towed on the Earl<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">March 13.</NOTE>.

the garter.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A ferment without doors.</NOTE> The victory obtained by the Tories over the Whigs, by the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of a &s;overeign of their own principles to the throne, produced a ferment without doors, though all things bore a face of harmony and unani|mity within. Violent men of both parties carried their own prejudices, with indecent freedom, to the pre&s;s; and di&s;graced their conver&s;ation with mutual reflections of the wor&s;t and mo&s;t dangerous kind. The Whigs were openly accu&s;ed of aiming at the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of a commonwealth, by endeavouring to deprive the reigning Queen of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne. The memory of the late King was attacked with open a&s;&s;ertions of the &s;ame kind; though it is highly pro|bable, that Prince was very indifferent about what per&s;on &s;hould mount, after him, the throne. An en+quiry by the lords into this idle tale, produced only a negative proof of its not being founded in fact. They voted, upon an examination of King William's pa+pers by a committee, that nothing appeared that tend+ed to the prejudice of her Maje&s;ty, or her &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown.

The Marquis of Normanby, remarkable for his attachment to her family, was rai&s;ed to the office of lord privy-&s;eal, by the Queen. But the mo&s;t im|portant promotion of all was that of the Lord Godol|phin, to the &s;taff of lord high-trea&s;urer of England. Though Godolphin was well qualified for this impor|tant &s;tation, he owed his office more to the influence of the Earl of Marlborough, than to his own merit. The connection, which had long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in political views, between the&s;e two noble per&s;ons, had been lately more clo&s;ely cemented, by the marriage of the &s;on of the former with the elde&s;t daughter of the latter.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">War declar|ed.</NOTE> The&s;e rea&s;ons united the Tories and the Jacobites, in an unanimous &s;upport of the government of the new Queen. The Whigs either yielded to the current of the people, always violent for monarchy in every new reign, or they were a&s;hamed of oppo&s;ing mea|&s;ures, which &s;prung fir&s;t from them&s;elves. On the &s;econd of May, the bu&s;ine&s;s of the intended war again&s;t France and Spain, was debated in the privy-council. The Earl of Roche&s;ter, maternal uncle to the Queen, is &s;aid to have propo&s;ed, that the Engli&s;h nation &s;hould only engage in the mea&s;ures of the allies, as auxiliaries; and that the chief weight of the war ought to re&s;t on tho&s;e, who had mo&s;t to fear from the power of France. The Earl of Marlborough, who had re|turned from Holland, after &s;ettling the projected ope|rations with the States, declared him&s;elf vehement for an immediate declaration of war, to be i&s;&s;ued by Eng|land, as a principal. The mea&s;ures taken by him&s;elf, during an emba&s;&s;y of a few days in Holland, rendered, in &s;ome degree, nece&s;&s;ary the mea&s;ure which he &s;up|ported. The States, upon the a&s;&s;urances made by the Queen, had agreed to all the propo&s;als of her reputed favourite. They had rai&s;ed him to the chief command of their troops, the allies had furni&s;hed, with alacrity, their &s;everal quotas, and every thing was actually pre|pared for a vigorous and active campaign. A majority of the council yielded either to the influence or rea&s;ons of the Earl of Marlborough. Their re&s;olutions were communicated, the &s;ame day, to the commons; and war was declared in form on the fourth of May.</P>

The mini&s;try, during the dependence of the bill, were left to their own opinions.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of Simon Fra&s;er.</NOTE> The principal actor in this political piece, and, perhaps, its author, was Captain Simon Fra&s;er, afterwards well known to the world by the title of Lord Lovat. Born with in&s;inuating talents, but rather forward than agreea|ble in his addre&s;s, he exerted his whole force upon man|kind, through the channel of their vanity. His flat|tery, though too obvious to e&s;cape even the ob&s;ervation of the weak, was too &s;trong to be re&s;i&s;ted entirely by men of &s;en&s;e. He &s;eemed &s;o eager in be&s;towing prai&s;e, that tho&s;e who approved the lea&s;t of his manner, a&s;|cribed his adulation to his want of judgment, with re|gard to others, more than to his own de&s;igns.

Habituated, through time, to this aban|doned conduct, he became, in a manner, incapable of deviating from it; and thus his profligacy, by being ge|nerally known, carried its own antidote in it&s;elf.

<P><MILESTONE N="1704" UNIT="year"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">State of parties.</NOTE> THE differences which had happened between the two hou&s;es of parliament, being con&s;idered as a quarrel of partie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, had rai&s;ed a ferment among their ad|herents, throughout the kingdom. The Whigs, having prevailed in the hou&s;e of lords, had carried the highe&s;t prai&s;es of that a&s;&s;embly to the pre&s;s, mixed with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t invectives on the commons, who favoured the

principles of their political opponents. The conte&s;t for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power, which had ever been the princi|ple motive for the violences on both &s;ides, was managed, as u&s;ual, upon topics calculated to engage the minds of the people. The Whigs averred, that religion was in danger, from a fixed de&s;ign of the Tories to defeat the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The Tories, on their part, af|firmed, that the Whigs extended their views to the &s;ub|ver&s;ion of monarchy it&s;elf, and the ruin of the church of England. A credulous multitude were thus to&s;&s;ed be|tween the vici&s;&s;itudes of hopes and fears, in proportion as either party found means to accommodate their own allegations to the principles or prejudices of the vulgar.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl of Nottingham</NOTE> Some changes made in the mini&s;try after the proroga|tion of parliament, rendered the high-church party di&s;|&s;atisfied, without gaining the confidence of the Whigs. The Earl of Nottingham, a man of vehement principles, with regard to the high prerogatives of the crown and an implicit faith in the church, was removed from the office of &s;ecretary of &s;tate. Nottingham had owed his &s;trict adherence to his party, an importance to which he was not entitled by his abilities. Though not de&s;titute of ta|lents for bu&s;ine&s;s, his extreme loquacity<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">MS. Notes, by Dean Swi&s;t.</NOTE> rai&s;ed &s;u&s;|picions concerning the &s;olidity of his under&s;tanding; and he was &s;o much wedded to his political opinions, that he could hardly live in common charity with men of mode|rate principles, either in church or &s;tate<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Macky's character</NOTE>. His at|tachment to the church had rendered him aver&s;e to the mea&s;ures of King James, while that Prince &s;at on the throne. But his zeal for the indefea&s;ible rights of mo|narchy induced him, afterwards, to favour the views of his family. He oppo&s;ed the abjuration of the Prince of Wales with &s;uch vehemence, that he is &s;aid to have &s;hed tears when the bill pa&s;&s;ed. But he was too prudent, of perhaps, too timid, to ri&s;que, like many others po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ame principles, any direct corre&s;pondence with the excluded family<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and &s;everal Tories di&s;|mi&s;ted.</NOTE> The re&s;ignation of Nottingham was attended by the removal of other adherents of the high-church, from &s;ome departments of importance. The Earl of Jer&s;ey, a man

who, with a very ordinary under&s;tanding, had pa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal of the greate&s;t offices in the kingdom, was deprived of the &s;taff of lord chamberlain; which the Earl of Kent was &s;aid to have purcha&s;ed with money, from the in|fluence of the Duche&s;s of Marlborough with the Queen<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Publications of the times.</NOTE>. Sir Edward Seymour, who through the cour&s;e of a long life had, in a manner, avowed his attachment to the excluded family, but had complied with the times, was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the office of comptroller of the Queen's hou&s;ehold. Blaithwaite, who had enjoyed, for many years, the place of &s;ecretary at war, was removed, more perhaps from the conveniency of having his office to be&s;tow upon ano|ther, than for any exceptions again&s;t either his own prin|ciples or conduct. Men who judged &s;uperficially of things, looked upon the&s;e changes as the con&s;equences of an alteration of &s;y&s;tem in the cabinet; and a&s;cribed to their own mi&s;taken opinion concerning the principles of the lord-trea&s;urer, what had actually proceeded from his prudence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Harley and others ad|vanced.</NOTE> Notwith&s;tanding the chearfulne&s;s with which the com|mons granted the &s;upplies for the war, and their firm ad|herence to Tory principles, the lord-trea&s;urer and the Duke of Marlborough perceived, from the complexion of the hou&s;e of lords in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, that a powerful oppo&s;ition to government was to be apprehend|ed from the Whigs. They per&s;uaded, therefore, the Queen, that it was nece&s;&s;ary either to &s;way or break the party, by bringing into office &s;ome of its reputed mem|bers<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">Hannover-papers. 1704.</NOTE>. Harley, then &s;peaker of the hou&s;e of commons, though he had uniformly oppo&s;ed the mea&s;ures of King William, was deemed, in principles, a Whig, from his being bred a di&s;&s;enter. He, however, was &s;uppo&s;ed too prudent to &s;acrifice his own intere&s;t to the views of par|ty; and as his talents for managing bu&s;ine&s;s in the hou&s;e of commons were known and acknowledged, he became a great object of acqui&s;ition to the Lord Godolphin. Harley, therefore, was fir&s;t &s;worn in at the council|board; and &s;oon after appointed &s;ecretary of &s;tate, in the room of the Earl of Nottingham.

The latter having, in the beginning of the year, vi&s;ited Holland, and concerted the operations of the campaign with the States, had returned to England before the prorogation of parliament. To carry into execution the plan which he had formed and weighed, he embarked at Harwich, on the nineteenth of April. The &s;ucce&s;s of the two la&s;t campaigns, having rendered the allies ma&s;ters of the Mae&s;e and Spani&s;h Guelderland, &s;uch a &s;trong barrier had been formed on the &s;ide of Flanders, that a &s;mall number of forces were deemed &s;ufficient to protect the frontiers of the States, again&s;t the efforts of the enemy. Marlborough having found means to convince the Dutch of their &s;ecurity, in that quarter, propo&s;ed to march into the heart of Germany, to pro|tect the Emperor, now almo&s;t threatened with the &s;iege of his capital, by the joint force of the French and Bavarians.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marlbo|rough marches</NOTE> The threatened march of the Elector, at the head of the combined army, into the hereditary dominions of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, was not, however, the only thing that alarmed the Emperor and continued his fears. The in|&s;urgents in Hungary, encouraged by France, had po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of &s;everal important places, and offered their aid to the enemy.

the Emperor, by carrying the war into Bavaria, which had been previou&s;ly taken, was ha&s;tened by this requi&s;ition. The Duke of Marlborough, having &s;ettled affairs with the States, left the Hague on the fifth of May, under the pretence of a de&s;ign to carry the war to the banks of the Mo&s;elle, and, by that river, to pene|trate into France, while every thing had been prepared for the real expedition to Bavaria and the Danube.</P>

D'Auverquerque, de&s;tined to command the army left for the defence of the Dutch frontiers, met the Duke at Mae&s;tricht; and his Grace advancing through Juliers, arrived in the camp near Coblentz, on the twen|ty-fifth of May.

Prince Eugene having ha&s;tened to Philip&s;burg, to take upon him&s;elf the com|mand of the army on the Upper-Rhine, the duke ad|vanced toward the Danube, and joined the Imperiali&s;ts, at We&s;ter&s;tetten; and having arrived on the river Brentz, on the twenty-eighth of June, he placed his camp with|in two leagues of the Elector of Bavaria's army. The troops of the allies con&s;i&s;ted of ninety-&s;ix battalions of foot, and two hundred and two &s;quadrons of hor&s;e and dragoons, provided with forty-four pieces of field can|non, four howitzers, and twenty-four pontons.

This action happen|ed on the &s;econd of July; and, the next day, Donawert was de&s;erted by the Bavarians; and thus, the allies ob|tained by their victory a bridge over the river, while they &s;eparated from one another the troops of the enemy &s;tationed on the Upper and Lower Danube.

To avoid a battle, with regard to the Elector of Bavaria and the French, was ultimately to force the allies to retire back to the Maine. But the Elector having been reinforced with a fre&s;h army under the command of the Mare&s;chal de Tallard, re&s;olved, after a &s;hort negociation into which he had entered to amu&s;e the allies, to abandon his own fate and that of his country, to the event of a battle.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation of the armies.</NOTE> Though the allies had pa&s;&s;ed, without re&s;i&s;tance, the Danube, they were incapable, for want of magazines, either to continue long on the banks of that river or to penetrate into Bavaria.

The evil de&s;tiny of France, the ignorance and haughtine&s;s of her generals, the Mare&s;chals Tallard and Mar&s;in, together with the vehemence of the Elector him&s;elf, offered, at length, the opportunity which the enemy &s;ought after in vain. Prince Eugene, having marched with twenty thou&s;and men, from the Rhine, to ob&s;erve Tallard on his march through the Black fore&s;t, had now joined the Duke of Marlborough.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Blenheim, Augu&s;t 13.</NOTE> The French and Bavarians lay encamped with the Danube on their right. The village of Blenheim, on the bank of that river, &s;tood a little advanced in the front of the right wing of their line. Their left was covered with an exten&s;ive thick wood, from which ran a rivulet along their front, into the Danube. This rivu|let, as it pa&s;&s;ed through the plain, formed an almo&s;t continued mora&s;s, which would have been very difficult to pa&s;s, had not the French and Bavarians, by a negli|gence fatal to them&s;elves, formed their line at a con&s;ide|rable di&s;tance behind. When the Elector and the mare&s;|chals perceived that the enemy, who were encamped with their left to the Danube and their right extending to the wood, were re&s;olved to give them battle, they threw twenty-eight battalions and eight &s;quadrons of dra|goons, into the village of Blenheim. Eight battalions were, at the &s;ame time, placed in another village, to|ward the center, with a de&s;ign, in conjunction with tho&s;e at Blenheim, to fall upon the rear of the enemy when they &s;hould pa&s;s the brook; and &s;o place them be|tween two fires. Such was the &s;ituation of the French on the morning of the thirteenth of Augu&s;t. Their wretched di&s;po&s;ition in&s;ured the lo&s;s of the battle. Their line, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of cavalry, formed at the head of their camp, was weakened by the&s;e large detachments, whil&s;t the enemy were permitted to pa&s;s the mora&s;s, formed by the rivulet, without any re&s;i&s;tance<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">Mem. du Marq. de Feuquiere.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The French and Bavari|ans routed.</NOTE> The Duke of Marlborough, who commanded the left of the allies, having formed his line, after pa&s;&s;ing the brook, ordered the two villages to be attacked by the infantry, while he him&s;elf led his cavalry again&s;t tho&s;e of Tallard. After &s;everal charges, with various &s;ucce&s;s, the courage of the French hor&s;e began, at length, to abate. They retired behind the fire of ten bartalions, that had advanced while the cavalry were engaged. The&s;e &s;u&s;tained the charge, for a con&s;iderable time, again&s;t the Engli&s;h foot. But the duke, in the mean time, having charged home with his hor&s;e the French cavalry, already wavering, drove them in their flight, into the Danube, and mo&s;t of tho&s;e who had e&s;caped the &s;word, were drowned in that river. The ten batta|lions

of the enemy's foot were, at the &s;ame time, charg|ed on all &s;ides and cut to pieces. Prince Eugene, who commanded on the right, had attacked the Elector of Bavaria and the Mare&s;chal de Mar&s;in. The Prince, however, could make no impre&s;&s;ion on their line. But when they perceived that Tallard was defeated, they threw them&s;elves into three columns, and quitted the field with great dexterity and expedition. Had they now fallen on the flank of Marlborough, who&s;e troops were employed in pillaging the camp of Tallard, the victory might have been recovered; or, at lea&s;t, the troops &s;ta|tioned in the two villages, might have been &s;aved. Tho&s;e at Aberclaw found means to e&s;cape, in the confu&s;ion.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;e|quences of the battle</NOTE> The battle of Blenheim, which &s;eemed to decide the fate of Germany, turned the whole &s;cale of the war again&s;t the hou&s;e of Bourbon.

The Mare&s;chal de Tallard him&s;elf was among the pri|&s;oners. The camp, equipage, baggage, and artillery of the enemy, fell into the hands of the conquerors, to|gether with every other trophy attending on a complete victory. The battle, however, was not unbloody on the &s;ide of the allies. Fourteen thou&s;and men were ei|ther killed or wounded, and among the &s;lain &s;everal officers of high merit and rank. The troops, under Prince Eugene, meeting with the greate&s;t re&s;i&s;tance, &s;uffered the mo&s;t. The Elector and the Mare&s;chal de Mar&s;in, though they &s;carce could be &s;aid to have been routed, retired, with every mark of a defeat, under the cover of night, to Ulm.

The &s;ame good fortune which had attended the arms of the confederates on the Danube, was not general on every &s;ide of the war.

Di&s;putes between the King of Portugal and the Duke of Schomberg, who commanded the Engli&s;h and Dutch auxiliaries, forced the Queen to recall that nobleman; who was &s;ucceeded by the Earl of Galloway, through the intrigues of Mr. Methuen, the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at the court of Li&s;bon. The King of Portugal and the Archduke, having in vain attempted to cro&s;s the river Angueda, and invade Ca&s;|tille, were forced to retreat from the pre&s;ence of the Duke of Berwick, into the heart of Portugal, where they di&s;tributed their troops in winter quarters<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. de Portugal, tom. ii.</NOTE>.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conduct of parties.</NOTE> The two parties, during the remainder of this &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, &s;eemed to have made an exchange of principles, could a judgment of their private views be formed from their public conduct. When the act of &s;e|curity, which had been pa&s;&s;ed in Scotland in the preceding &s;ummer, came to be debated in the parliament of Eng|land, the Whigs and Tories complained again&s;t it with equal warmth. The fir&s;t endeavoured to derive advan|tage from a circum&s;tance &s;o favourable to their avowed principles. The latter pretended, from the like motives, to guard again&s;t its con&s;equences. The Tories, in their arguments in the hou&s;e of commons, urged that the pa&s;|&s;ing the act of &s;ecurity tended to defeat the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the hou&s;e of Hannover. But when this propo&s;ition was reduced into a motion, it was rejected by the Whigs, though they had profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves the only friends of the de&s;cent of the crown in the prote&s;tant line. The two parties, however, agreed that &s;ome vigorous efforts mu&s;t be taken in England, to obviate the dangers ari&s;ing from the proceedings in Scotland. The violent, on both &s;ides, were, however, well-plea&s;ed at bottom with mea&s;ures which &s;eemed equally calculated to promote their re&s;pec|tive views. The republican part of the Whigs looked upon the act of &s;ecurity as highly favourable to their own principles; and the warm Jacobites among the Tories con&s;idered the exclu&s;ion of the hou&s;e of Hannover, as a great &s;tep towards the re&s;toration of the excluded branch of the family of Stuart.</P>

The Duke of Marlborough arrived in Holland in the beginning of April; and having concerted the operations of the campaign with the States, took the field in the fir&s;t week in May. His great object was to improve the victories of the preceding campaign, by carrying the war by the Mo&s;elle into the heart of France. With the &s;ame number of troops as in the la&s;t year, he marched through the country of Lim|bourg; and being joined near Treves by the Prince of He&s;&s;e, he cro&s;&s;ed the Mo&s;elle and the Saar, marched to the defile of Taveren, and advanced to El&s;t. The French apprized of the de&s;igns of Marlborough, had a&s;&s;embled an army of &s;eventy thou&s;and men on that &s;ide, under the command of the Mare&s;chal de Villars, who occupying a &s;trong camp at Sirk, re&s;olved to remain on the defen&s;ive.

That Prince born with a degree of virtue, was de&s;titute of talents. The apparent line of ambition which pa&s;&s;ed through his whole conduct, was rather the di&s;po&s;i|tion of his court than any pa&s;&s;ion of his own. His &s;on, who had been, &s;everal years before, created King of the Romans, &s;ucceeded him in the Imperial dignity. That Prince inherited his father's mini&s;ters as well as his domi|nions; and the &s;ame coun&s;els continued to act under the name of Jo&s;eph, that had uniformly prevailed in the reign of Leopold. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the Spani&s;h throne, the increa&s;e of the Imperial power, on the ruins of the au|thority of the German princes, and the reduction of the in&s;urgents in Hungary, were the principal objects of the pre&s;ent as well as of the late Emperor. But Jo&s;eph was better calculated than his father to &s;ucceed in the&s;e views. His mind was active and full of fire, his di&s;po&s;ition vehe|ment, his character enterpri&s;ing; and to an indu&s;try, which ran violently from one &s;cheme to another, he add|ed a firmne&s;s of &s;oul, that di&s;dained to yield either to ac|cident or misfortune.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ob&s;ervations</NOTE> The &s;trife between the Whigs and Tories, in &s;hew|ing an appearance of zeal for the family of Hannover, proceeded more from the &s;elfi&s;h views of their re&s;pective leaders, than from motives of public good. To &s;ecure the good opinion of the people, in countries po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of liberty, is the &s;horte&s;t way of gaining, and the &s;ure&s;t means of retaining power. In the political farces too fre|quently exhibited by parties, the populace are the &s;pecta|tors; and tho&s;e who &s;uit their antick ge&s;tures be&s;t to their prejudices, carry the mo&s;t applau&s;e. Two princi|ples had long been predominant in the minds of the Eng|li&s;h nation: a fixed aver&s;ion to France; and a zeal, which bordered on enthu&s;ia&s;m, for the prote&s;tant religion. The manly &s;pirit which undeviatingly looks forward to public freedom, independent of common prejudices, fell only to the &s;hare of a few. The pretence to that &s;pirit, though a &s;tale impo&s;ture, &s;eldom failed to impo&s;e on the world. The Whigs, when they affected to give the great &s;ecurity to the Prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, paid their court to the populace, in a manner incon&s;i&s;tent with the avowed principles of their party. They repealed, in the bill of regency, the limitations which the Tories had impo&s;ed on the &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the act of &s;ettlement; and, with a frankne&s;s &s;carce con&s;i&s;tent with common prudence, boa&s;ted openly, that they re&s;tored to the crown all its former prerogatives. The &s;pirit of party, however, had been carried to &s;uch a pitch, that every mea&s;ure calcu|lated to annoy their adver&s;aries, was deemed, not only ju&s;tifiable, but even laudable, by both &s;ides.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Campaign of 1706.</NOTE> During the&s;e important tran&s;actions at home, prepara|tions were made abroad for opening, with vigour, the campaign, on every &s;ide. The Duke of Marlborough having left the Hague, on the ninth of May, joined, on the twentieth of the month, the united armies of Eng|land and the States, between Borchloen and Gro&s;zwa|ren. France, in an evil hour for her&s;elf, had re&s;olved to act offen&s;ively in Flanders. The Mare&s;chal de Villeroi, i&s;&s;uing from the lines which he had formed behind the Deule, advanced to Tirlemont; and, without waiting for the arrival of the Elector of Bavaria, with whom he was joined in the command, pu&s;hed forward precipitate|ly to Ramillies. When his front had advanced to the heights where ri&s;es the little Geette, he perceived the allies, on full march, appearing in &s;ight. He immedi|ately formed his army in order of battle. The Geette and an impa&s;&s;able mora&s;s running along its banks, covered his left wing; and prevented it alike from being attacked it&s;elf and from charging the enemy. The village of Ramillies, &s;ituated in a plain near the &s;ource of the Geette, was advanced before his centre, which con&s;i&s;ted entirely of infantry. The village of Tavieres, on the banks of the Mehaigne, covered his right wing; and an open and level &s;pace, between Tavieres and Ramillies, about a mile and a half in length, was filled with one hundred &s;quadrons of hor&s;e. In this narrow aperture the

His line extended through the plain to the left, which was covered by the river Me|haigne. Having, by a feigned attack, on the right of the French, which was, in fact, impracticable, deceiv|ed the Mare&s;chal de Villeroi, he obtained his purpo&s;e of obliging the enemy to thin their left, which introduced a confu&s;ion, while it weakened their line in the only place where they could be attempted with advantage. The Duke, in the mean time, ordered Auverquerque, with the Dutch infantry, to begin the battle on the left, while he him&s;elf, covering his motions with the ri&s;ing ground, fell at once on the centre of the enemy, with all the foot that formed his own. The French making a gallant re&s;i&s;tance, Marlborough ordered all his cavalry to make a home charge. But, in the hurry, he him&s;elf, being a bad hor&s;eman, falling to the ground, was in dan|ger of being trampled to death by his own &s;quadrons.

To com|plete the misfortunes of the French, the remarkable cir|cum&s;tance, which happened at the village of Blenheim two years before, was a &s;econd time exhibited, at that of Ramillies.

Confu&s;ion, &s;laughter, and flight prevailed. Many were cut to pieces, the re&s;t were di&s;per&s;ed.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arguments</NOTE> To the&s;e declamatory apo&s;trophes, the Duke and other members added arguments of a more &s;olid kind<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Mem. of Scotland.</NOTE>. They averred, that all the advantages from a participa|tion of government with England, and the repo&s;e that might be expected from an union with a powerful king|dom, were but mean con&s;iderations for the &s;pirit which the people mu&s;t lo&s;e with their independence as a nation. They argued, that though individuals might profit by the change, the country in general mu&s;t &s;uffer decay from the removal of the &s;eat of government, which, like the heart in the human frame, threw life and vigour from the center to the extremities of the kingdom. They affirmed, that in&s;tead of bringing a part of the commerce of England into Scotland, the Union would ruin that of the latter kingdom, by carrying away from their native country, to which they would probably never return, the mo&s;t enterpri&s;ing and the mo&s;t indu&s;trious of its in|habitants. They &s;aid, that impo&s;ts already laid on the trade of England, would more than counter-balance the pre&s;ent di&s;advantages of that of the Scots, who&s;e imports and exports were le&s;s burdened; and they affirmed, that though &s;ome change for the better might happen, with regard to commerce in &s;ome particular places, that cir|cum&s;tance ought rather to be a&s;cribed to an increa&s;e of indu&s;try in a few individuals, than to the general pro&s;pe|rity of the country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">again&s;t the Union.</NOTE> They de&s;cended from the&s;e more obvious arguments, to &s;peculative ob&s;ervations.

They averred, that the Scotti&s;h peers, by relinqui&s;hing the right of their order to &s;it and vote in parliament, had be|trayed the honour of their country, and actually altered its con&s;titution; and that the &s;mall number of the re|pre&s;entatives of the people, had effectually thrown the

nation under the dominion of &s;trangers, while it deprived many individuals of the honour and advantage of having a &s;hare in framing laws by which they were to be govern|ed. They derived an argument again&s;t the Union, from the dangers in which it might involve even the freedom of England, and con&s;equently that of Scotland, as united with that kingdom, in its misfortunes, rather than in its advantages. The repre&s;entatives of the Scots, they &s;aid, would inevitably become a poor and de&s;picable race, de|pending on the pur&s;e, and con&s;equently on the will of the Crown; and having &s;hewn &s;o little concern for the &s;upport of their own con&s;titution, it was not to be ex|pected they would pay any regard to that of another nation.</P>

Though Scotland had been long torn to pieces with violent factions and ob&s;tinate parties, the Union had become much more nece&s;&s;ary for England than for that kingdom. Had, therefore, the parliament of Scotland regarded their own future intere&s;t more than a trival advantage at pre&s;ent, there is &s;carce any doubt but they could have commanded terms more con&s;onant to the independence which they claimed in the name of their country. But though the Jacobites a&s;cribed the pa&s;&s;ing of the act of Union to the venality of the members, they might with equal ju&s;tice accu&s;e their own want of &s;pirit and folly.

The act of &s;ecurity, by placing arms in their hands two years before, had rendered them fit for war. The nobility and chiefs of clans, under the &s;anction of law, had, for two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ummers, called their va&s;|&s;als to the field, formed encampments, and e&s;tabli&s;hed a degree of di&s;cipline.

Queen Anne. His undeviating adherence to the intere&s;t of James the Second, his indu&s;try and negociations in that Prince's favour in England, till the affair of Darien had rendered Scotland a more promi&s;ing field for intrigue, had gained to the Duke an unbounded confidence from the court of St. Germains. He conducted him&s;elf ac|cording to their in&s;tructions, and THEY paid the utmo&s;t deference to his advice. When the country-party, in conjunction with the Jacobites, had carried repeated re|&s;olutions in parliament, that the &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the crown of England &s;hould NOT mount the throne of Scotland, a gleam of royalty &s;eems to have opened on the Duke of Hamilton's mind. This cooled his zeal for the family of Stuart and di&s;concerted his own mea&s;ures, by being an object too great and too difficult for his limited capacity. Though after the po&s;terity of James the Fir&s;t of Eng|land, the Duke was the next Prote&s;tant heir to the crown of Scotland, he was, by no means, qualified to gratify his ambition. His e&s;tate was not great, and he was over|whelmed with debt.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections</NOTE> Though the terms of the Union were by no means calculated to flatter the pride of the Scots, as an inde|pendent people, no expedient could be deemed unfortu|nate, that put an end to their own government, as it then &s;tood. There were radical defects in the con&s;titu|tion of the kingdom, which in the be&s;t times and in the able&s;t hands, could not fail to be productive of perpetual evils to the nation. The e&s;tates of parliament, by meet|ing in one hou&s;e and voting promi&s;cuou&s;ly, in all debates, created a confu&s;ion and promoted a jarring of intere&s;ts,
<PB N="332" REF="351">
more likely to embarra&s;s than to tran&s;act the bu&s;ine&s;s of the public, with regularity and preci&s;ion. The number of the peers, the poverty of that order, and their con&s;e|quent dependence on the crown, by carrying every vote in parliament, left the body of the people, in a manner, without a repre&s;entative. The weight, which the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of England threw into the &s;cale of the &s;overeign, had improved his authority, before the Revolution, into an almo&s;t uncontroulable tyranny. The crown was ab|&s;olute, though government was permitted to retain its ancient form. The blow, which the royal prerogative received in Scotland, in the memorable year 1688, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed licentiou&s;ne&s;s rather than freedom, in that king|dom. The parliament were placed in a &s;ituation to make the mo&s;t for them&s;elves, at the hands of the King, while the people felt nothing from the alteration in government, but a change of tyrants.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">on the union</NOTE> Notwith&s;tanding this untoward picture of the affairs of Scotland, the period of time between the Revolution and the pa&s;&s;ing of the act of union, produced men of eminent talents in that kingdom. The freedom of debate, which was introduced by the Revolution into parliament, fur|ni&s;hed many with the means of di&s;covering their own parts; and animated them with an eagerne&s;s, which man|kind mi&s;took for public &s;pirit. In an evil hour, for the nation, they were divided into many and irreconcilable factions; a circum&s;tance hurtful in any country, but par|ticularly ruinous, where the field of conte&s;t is too &s;mall. While they watched the motions of one another, the golden opportunity of mending their own con&s;titution at home, or of incorporating them&s;elves, upon honourable and advantageous terms, with England, was for ever lo&s;t. The peculiar &s;ituation of the latter kingdom had placed the fate of her monarchy, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, in the hands of the Scots; and the latter could &s;carce be called unrea|&s;onable, &s;hould they in&s;i&s;t upon meeting their more pow|erful neighbours upon a footing of greater equality. But in the animo&s;ity of parties, all regard for the public was lo&s;t; and a kind of mean &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, which &s;carce de&s;erv|ed to be dignified with the name of avarice, took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of every brea&s;t, and marked the age with indelible infamy.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace offer|ed by France.</NOTE> While the great event of the union between the Bri|ti&s;h kingdoms, was ready to &s;ecure the tranquillity of England at home, &s;he prepo&s;terou&s;ly rejected propo&s;als for re&s;toring, upon the mo&s;t honourable terms for her&s;elf, the general peace of Europe.

the King of Sweden, with an ob&s;tinacy &s;uitable to his character, increa&s;ed his complaints and multiplied his demands.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Siege of Toulon.</NOTE> The mo&s;t memorable event of the year was the &s;iege of Toulon, and the mi&s;carriage of the allies before that im|portant place. The reduction of the Spani&s;h dominions in Italy, and the capitulation &s;igned at Milan in March, by which the French army abandoned that country, left the Duke of Savoy and Prince Eugene at freedom to carry the war into the enemy's country. In concert with England and Holland a project was formed, either to de&s;troy or take Toulon and Mar&s;eilles; an enterpri&s;e, if crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, which could not fail to be highly beneficial to the maritime powers, as well as of great im|portance to the confederates in general. The Duke of Savoy and Prince Eugene, having, for &s;ome time, amu&s;ed the French with marches and countermarches, turned &s;uddenly toward the &s;hore of the Mediterranean, forced the pa&s;&s;age of the river Var, advanced along the coa&s;t of Provence, and, after a long march, through a hot, rugged, and inho&s;pitable country, arrived before Toulon, on the twenty-&s;ixth of July.

Troops were advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted on the hills adjacent to the walls. The allies having taken the heights of St. Catherine, were driven from thence, on the fourteenth of Augu&s;t, with great &s;laughter. The number of troops in Toulon and in

The French, under the Duke de Vend&ocirc;me, prudently avoided an action; and they managed their motions &s;o well, that they furni&s;hed the enemy no oppor|tunity of attacking them, with advantage. The princi|pal operations at &s;ea, were confined to the fruitle&s;s &s;iege of Toulon. The Chevalier de Forbin had the good for|tune of taking two Engli&s;h men of war, with twenty merchantmen; and what was &s;till more fortunate for him|&s;elf, to make his e&s;cape after an engagement with a &s;u|perior &s;quadron. Some advantages were obtained by the Engli&s;h on the coa&s;t of North-America. But they &s;u&s;|tained a very great lo&s;s in the &s;hipwreck of Sir Cloud&s;ley Shovel. That admiral, on the twenty-ninth of Septem|ber, &s;ailed from Gibraltar, with a fleet of fifteen &s;hips of the line and &s;ome frigates.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections on the cam|paign.</NOTE> The campaign of the year 1707, though in &s;ome de|gree favourable to the hou&s;e of Bourbon, &s;carce &s;u&s;pend|ed their misfortunes. The conque&s;t of Naples balanced the benefits derived from the victory obtained at Almanza; and the &s;iege of Toulon, though un&s;ucce&s;sful on the part of the allies, was extremely detrimental to France. The enemy, in their march and retreat through Provence, ruined a great extent of country. The attempt defeated the projects of France on the &s;ide of Germany, by di|viding her forces. Villars having penetrated to the Da|nube, was forced to repa&s;s the Rhine; and to relinqui&s;h to an enemy, who could not meet him before in the field, all the advantages of a campaign, that &s;eemed to threaten to change the whole face of affairs. A degree of morti|fication was added to the misfortunes of the court of Ver|&s;ailles. The Duke of Savoy, who&s;e capital was be&s;ieged by a French army, in the preceding campaign, was at the head of a powerful inva&s;ion in the dominions of France, in the pre&s;ent year. But the conduct of the court of France was now as feeble as her misfortunes were numerous. The Salique law &s;eemed to have been made in vain, in a country de&s;tined to be governed and ruined by women. Madame de Maintenon, though advanced in years, maintained her influence over the &s;u|perannuated mind of the King. Flattery to an aged mi&s;tre&s;s, became a better title than merit, to the com|mand of armies; and, thus, the folly of his own councils became as fatal to Lewis as the arms of the confederates.</P>

they derived their own political exi&s;tence. The genera|lity of the Scoti&s;h nation, either &s;wayed by their pride, or yielding to their prejudices, were loud in their complaints; and wanted nothing but leaders to appeal from their par|liament to the deci&s;ion of the &s;word. The populace, in particular, were &s;o eager to take up arms, that the nobi|lity and chiefs were forced to avoid mixing with their va&s;&s;als, for fear of being in&s;ulted for not leading them di|rectly to the field<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Hooke's Negociations.</NOTE>.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Intrigues of France.</NOTE> Happily for England, and, perhaps, ultimately for the Scots them&s;elves, the court of France was &s;till more de&s;|titute of coun&s;els than of power. In&s;tead of li&s;tening to the earne&s;t &s;olicitations of the malecontents, in &s;ending the Pretender, with a force &s;ufficient to protect his per&s;on, to Scotland, they di&s;patched colonel Hooke into that kingdom, with in&s;tructions more calculated to depre&s;s the &s;pirits of the Jacobites, than to rou&s;e them to arms. Hooke arriving &s;oon after the rece&s;s of parliament, made a &s;ecret progre&s;s through the northern counties, and pre|&s;ented to the leaders of the Jacobites, letters from the King of France, as well as from the Pretender. The Dukes of Gordon and Athol, the Earls of Errol, Mari&s;hal, Panmure, and Strathmore, the Vi&s;count Stormont, and in general, all the nobility and gentry to the North of the Forth, and many who&s;e e&s;tates lay to the South of that river, received him with gladne&s;s, and expre&s;&s;ed their readine&s;s to take up arms for the exiled family. Their enthu&s;ia&s;m in favour of the Pretender and aver&s;ion to the Union were &s;o great, that though it was apparent Hooke's object was to engage them in every thing, and the French King in nothing, they &s;igned a general me|morial, referring implicitly the expected aid from France to the genero&s;ity of Lewis the Fourteenth.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hooke's ne|gociations.</NOTE> In this memorial, after a complimentary preamble to the French King, they &s;ignified their earne&s;t de&s;ire that the Pretender &s;hould be immediately &s;ent to Scotland. They affirmed that, upon his arrival, he &s;hould be re|ceived
<PB N="345" REF="364">
without oppo&s;ition as king; and that the e&s;tabli&s;h|ed government would in&s;tantly vani&s;h without making the lea&s;t effort for its own &s;upport. Out of the great number of men that were to be led by his adherents to his &s;tandard, they propo&s;ed to &s;elect twenty-five thou&s;and foot and five thou&s;and hor&s;e. The&s;e they promi&s;ed to clothe, to arm, and to provide with provi&s;ions till they &s;hould march into England. But, upon that event they in&s;inuated, that a monthly &s;ub&s;idy ought to be paid by France, &s;hould the war be prolonged for any time, by the re&s;i&s;tance of the Engli&s;h nation to the per&s;on whom the memoriali&s;ts called their lawful King. They &s;olemn|ly a&s;&s;ured the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, that the whole king|dom, from an aver&s;ion to the Union, were unanimous in their wi&s;hes for the re&s;toration of the exiled family; and that, as they threw them&s;elves under his Maje&s;ty's pro|tection, they were confident he would effectually &s;upport their cau&s;e. They, however, left the time, the man|ner, and the &s;trength to be &s;ent, entirely to him&s;elf. The whole &s;train of the memorial was &s;piritle&s;s, though vehement. It expre&s;&s;ed an enthu&s;ia&s;m for an immediate in&s;urrection, which Lewis, had he been more attentive to his own intere&s;t, might have greatly improved to his advantage<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Hooke's Negociations.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conduct of the court of St. Ger|mains.</NOTE> Together with this memorial, Hooke was charged with letters from the leaders of the malecontents to the Pretender and the French mini&s;try. Having arrived in France, in the month of July, he laid the &s;ub&s;tance of his negociations before the court of Ver&s;ailles. The Earl of Middleton, who managed the affairs of the Pre|tender, attempted to add the weight of argument to the offers and &s;olicitations of the Scots. He endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h the probability of the &s;ucce&s;s of an in&s;urrection in Scotland, by the recent and &s;till-exi&s;ting re&s;i&s;tance of the Hungarians again&s;t the forces and efforts of the court of Vienna.

a &s;eries of victories, for five years, in Poland, found new enemies ri&s;ing, as it were, from the blood of the &s;lain, till, by making a &s;udden irruption into Saxony, he put, at once, an end to the war and the reign of King Augu&s;tus. He affirmed, that the enemies of France were convinced of the ju&s;tne&s;s of the&s;e maxims; as appeared from their efforts in Spain, their attempts upon the Mo&s;elle, their project of a de&s;cent on the coa&s;t of the ocean, and the pre&s;ent inva&s;ion of the Duke of Savoy along the &s;hore of the Mediterranean<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Middleton to M. de Chamillart.

Happily for Great Britain, the mea&s;ures of the French mini&s;try were too much di&s;concerted with an inva&s;ion of their own country, to think of carrying the war into that of the enemy. The &s;ullen &s;ilence which aro&s;e in Scot|land, from the anxious expectations of the di&s;contented, was, in the mean time, mi&s;taken by the &s;uperficial for an acquie&s;cence in the Union between the kingdoms. The affairs of England, in like manner, wore the face of tranquillity. The attention of the people being turned to the operations of the war, the bickerings between par|ties were either forgot or neglected. But to tho&s;e, who from judicious ob&s;ervations on the pa&s;t, could penetrate into the future, a &s;torm &s;eemed to be gathering behind the tran&s;ient &s;un-&s;hine, which, to u&s;e a metaphor, en|lightened at pre&s;ent the kingdom. The lord-trea&s;urer thinking, perhaps, that he had gone too far, in oppo&s;i|tion to his principles, in accompli&s;hing the Union, &s;eem|ed, from his conduct, little anxious about its continuance. Every mea&s;ure calculated to exa&s;perate the Scots again&s;t that treaty was adopted.

A new female favourite had, in a great mea&s;ure, &s;upplanted the Duche&s;s of Marlborough in the affections of the Queen, or rather in the dominion which &s;he had e&s;tabli&s;hed over the mind of that timid and ea&s;y prince&s;s.

forgetting the animo&s;ity between the Whigs and the To|ries in his own re&s;entment again&s;t the mini&s;try, had paid a vi&s;it to the Earl of Nottingham, with propo&s;itions to join the high-church party to humble Marlborough and Godolphin. The latter noblemen, from views of their own, were highly aver&s;e to pacific mea&s;ures. But the current ran violently again&s;t the war, till Marlborough returned to the kingdom. The chief rea&s;on oppo&s;ed by the Duke to a peace, was that France, pre&s;uming on her &s;ucce&s;s at Almanza, had receded from the terms which &s;he had offered the preceding year. He pretend|ed, that Lewis the Fourteenth had then promi&s;ed to re|&s;tore Spain and the Indies. The recovery of the whole Spani&s;h monarchy out of the hands of the hou&s;e of Bour|bon, he knew, had been the chief object of the Engli&s;h nation in their warm pro&s;ecution of the war, from the hopes that they had conceived of the great mercantile ad|vantages re&s;ulting from a treaty already concluded with the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. The Duke in&s;inuated, that to ob|tain that great object, there was a nece&s;&s;ity for continu|ing the war; and this argument, though founded on a mi&s;repre&s;entation of the fact, had great weight with the trading part of the nation.<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Campaign in Flanders.</NOTE> During the&s;e tran&s;actions in England, preparations were made abroad, for opening, with vigour, the cam|paign. The Duke of Marlborough, having left London on the twenty-ninth of March, arrived the next evening at the Hague, where he was met by Prince Eugene of Savoy. The&s;e two generals, having &s;ettled with the States the operations of the &s;ummer, repaired by differ|ent roads, to Hannover, to reconcile the Elector to the regulations which they had &s;ettled, without his commu|nication, with regard to the army which his Highne&s;s commanded, in the clo&s;e of the preceding year, on the Upper-Rhine. The Duke of Marlborough, having placed him&s;elf at the head of the confederates, in the neighbourhood of Ghent, in the end of May, the French took the field on that &s;ide, with an army &s;uperior to the allies, in point of number. They were commanded, in the name of the Duke of Burgundy, by the Duke de Vend&ocirc;me. Though they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;trength &s;uf|ficient to cope with the enemy in the field, they cho&s;e rather to rely on &s;tratagem and &s;urpri&s;e, than on the more uncertain &s;ucce&s;s of open force. The Elector of Bavaria, during his long government in Flanders, had gained an influence among the Flemings, which he re|tained, after the greate&s;t part of the country had been lo&s;t to the allies, in the fatal battle of Ramillies. He either obtained, by his intrigues, or purcha&s;ed with the money of France, an ab&s;olute promi&s;e from the magi&s;|trates of the cities of Ghent, Antwerp, and Bruges to open their gates to the troops of the hou&s;e of Bourbon. The extortions of the allies, of which neither Marlbo|rough nor his friend Cadogan had been unconcerned &s;pectators<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">Mem. of the Generality of Ghent, MS.</NOTE>, contributed to this projected revolt, as much as the intrigues of the Elector of Bavaria.</P>

The Duke of Marl|borough, accu&s;ed, perhaps very unju&s;tly, of being privy to the treachery, from intere&s;ted views, was incapable of preventing its effects. Though much inferior in force to

The opportu|nity, which the French generals now denied to the ene|my, was &s;oon offered by their own di&s;putes. Returning from the Dender, they directed their march to the Scheld. But the Duke of Marlborough, who had been joined by Prince Eugene, had already pa&s;&s;ed that river, and lay between the French and their lines. The enemy could no longer decline battle. The Scheld, with &s;eve|ral inclo&s;ures, covered their left. A mora&s;s ran along their front; and, on a ri&s;ing ground on their right they placed their cavalry, interlined with bodies of foot<NOTE N="S" PLACE="foot">Mem. du Marq. de Feuquiere.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">French par|tially de|feated.</NOTE> The infantry of the allies advancing acro&s;s the mora&s;s, were received with great re&s;olution and &s;pirit by the ene|my.

To avoid, however, being flanked by the Briti&s;h hor&s;e, who were now victo|rious, they &s;heltered them&s;elves in the inclo&s;ures on the banks of the Scheld. The battle, however, was by no means deci&s;ive. But the fears and bad conduct of the French, yielded to the allies all the con&s;equences of a compleat victory. No baggage, no cannon were lo&s;t. It was the repul&s;e of a party, rather than a general rout. The allies expected nothing but the renewal of battle upon better terms the next morning. But the French retreated through five different routes in the night. The general confu&s;ion and panic which prevailed in this di&s;|graceful and di&s;orderly retreat, by breaking the &s;pirits of the &s;oldiers, di&s;concerted all the mea&s;ures of the French generals for the re&s;t of the campaign<NOTE N="T" PLACE="foot">French Writers, pa&s;&s;im.</NOTE>.</P>

They retired from Ghent under Tournay and under Ypres. They permitted Prince Eugene, who&s;e reinforcement of Germans from the Mo&s;elle was now arrived, to form the &s;iege of Li&s;le. That city, fortified with all the art of

The Duke of Vend&ocirc;me attempted, in vain, to relieve the place, by endeavouring to cut off the convoys of the enemy from beyond the Scheld and from O&s;tend. In attacking a party of Engli&s;h at Winnendal, a French detachment was defeated with the lo&s;s of their cannon and all their implements of war. In attempting to attack the enemy before Li&s;le, though joined by the Duke of Berwick with a great reinforcement, Vend&ocirc;me was twice di&s;ap|pointed, after a fruitle&s;s cannonade.

But the difficulties of the allies were not ended with the conque&s;t of Li&s;le. They had lo&s;t be|tween eighteen and twenty thou&s;and men before the place, which had rendered their army much inferior to the French.

To pa&s;s a river who&s;e banks were occupied by an enemy &s;uperior in number was dangerous as well as difficult. To remain in the neighbourhood of Li&s;le for the win|ter, would have been to abandon the re&s;t of Flanders, the province of Brabant, Guelderland, and a part of the territories of the States, to the mercy of the French.

authentic proofs, that their titles to their territories were derived from the unanimous con&s;ent of the empire. In con&s;equence of his declaration, he ordered the Duke of Parma to pay homage for his dominions within fif|teen days, under the pain of confi&s;cation. The&s;e ob&s;o|lete and pre&s;cribed claims &s;pread a general con&s;ternation, The Republics of Venice and Genoa, the Dukes of Mo|dena, Savoy, and Tu&s;cany, were all intere&s;ted in the Emperor's demands. The hou&s;e of Bourbon entertained hopes of forming a confederacy in Italy again&s;t a prince &s;o unju&s;t and unrea&s;onable. But their expectations were qua&s;hed by the reduction of the i&s;lands in the Mediter|ranean, a circum&s;tance that enabled the maritime powers to awe the Italian States with their fleets.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">New parlia|ment.</NOTE> The great &s;ucce&s;s of the campaign, confirmed the influence which Marlborough and Godolphin had ac|quired, by the expul&s;ion of Harley from the cabinet. They found means, at the &s;ame time, to reconcile the Whigs to their mea&s;ures, by dividing with their leaders the power and emoluments of government. The weight of the crown being thrown into the &s;cale of that party, they carried mo&s;t of the conte&s;ted elections again&s;t the Tories.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1709. Laws of trea&s;on ex|tended to Scotland.</NOTE> Another matter of importance with regard to Scotland, rai&s;ed the attention and employed the debates of the two hou&s;es of parliament. Upon the attempt of an inva&s;ion from France, in the preceding year, &s;everal peers and gentlemen of rank were &s;eized, by the procurement of the Scoti&s;h lords in the mini&s;try, and were brought pri|&s;oners to London. Though all were &s;u&s;pected of main|taining a corre&s;pondence with the invaders, and many were actually guilty, proof could be carried home to none. They were, therefore, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. But the di&s;|grace and expence which they incurred upon bare pre|&s;umptions, had induced mankind in general to conclude, that they had been treated with unju&s;t &s;everity. This circum&s;tance, together with a di&s;pute between the court of ju&s;ticiary and the Queen's advocate in Scot|land, concerning the trial of &s;ome Jacobites in that king|dom, induced the lords to introduce a bill for extending the laws of trea&s;on already e&s;tabli&s;hed in England, to the whole kingdom of Great Britain. The trials in matters of trea&s;on being le&s;s &s;evere in Scotland than in England, the whole repre&s;entative of the former oppo&s;ed the bill in both hou&s;es. It was, however, pa&s;&s;ed into a law. The commons, to gratify the Scots, in &s;ome degree, made an amendment, which directed, that all per&s;ons indicted for high trea&s;on or mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on, &s;hould have not on|ly a copy of their indictment, but a li&s;t of all the witne&s;&s;|es to be produced, and of the jurors immpanelled, with their profe&s;&s;ions and places of abode, delivered to them ten days before the trial, and in the pre&s;ence of two wit|ne&s;&s;es.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An act of grace.</NOTE> The debates concerning the laws of trea&s;on, contributed to convince the Earl of Godolphin of the convenience of an ample act of grace. He knew that he him&s;elf, from his corre&s;pondence with the court of St. Germains,
<PB N="372" REF="391">
<MILESTONE N="1709" UNIT="year"> was obnoxious, upon a di&s;covery, to the law. He was not ignorant that he had many enemies who &s;u&s;pected him of trea&s;onable practices, and &s;ome who were actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed of proofs &s;ufficient to ruin his reputation, if not to en|danger his head. The Marquis of Annandale, it is &s;aid, either by accident or art, had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of an ori|ginal letter of the lord-trea&s;urer to the court of St. Ger|mains. In the beginning of the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion, the Mar|quis had petitioned again&s;t the undue election of one of the peers for Scotland; and, by in&s;inuating that he was privy to Godolphin's &s;ecret attachment to the excluded family, he obtained the weight of government and gain|ed a &s;eat in the hou&s;e of peers. The Earl of Wharton, perceiving the unexpected &s;ucce&s;s of Annandale, treated with that nobleman for the u&s;e of his valuable manu&s;cript. He obtained the letter, and was in&s;tantly declared lord-lieutenant of Ireland. The mi&s;chievous Wharton was at no pains to keep the &s;ecret. The whole junto derived benefit from the di&s;covery. Pembroke, Somers, Dor&s;et, and their retainers, demanded offices and were gratified. But &s;till Godolphin was in danger, till the act of grace pa&s;&s;ed, in the beginning of the pre&s;ent year. The bill &s;eem|ed calculated chiefly for the lord-trea&s;urer him&s;elf. Few things were pardoned except all corre&s;pondence with the court of St. Germains. Wharton, who hoped to derive &s;till greater advantages from the letter, which he is &s;aid to have either purcha&s;ed or obtained from the Marquis of Annandale, was completely outwitted by the Earl of Godolphin. The latter, by a&s;&s;uring him that the mate|rial bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;e&s;&s;ion was over, had induced his lord&s;hip to repair to his government of Ireland. But the fir&s;t intelligence he received at Dublin was, that the mi|ni&s;ter had e&s;caped from his hands under the &s;anction of an act of grace.</P>

The Tories, in particular, had joined a per&s;onal quarrel again&s;t Marl|borough, to the u&s;ual violence of men excluded from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of influence and office. They were furni&s;hed by the Duke him&s;elf with a circum&s;tance &s;uitable to their de&s;ires. Cardonnel, Marlborough's &s;ecretary, in writing to the Queen a detail of the battle of Winnendal, attri|buted the whole honour of the affair to General Cadogan, the favourite of his ma&s;ter, who had not the lea&s;t &s;hare in the action. General Webb, to who&s;e activity and cou|rage the victory was principally a&s;cribed, was not even named in the letter. Cardonnel's account was made pub|lic. Webb was enraged.

They were no &s;trangers to the true &s;tate of the fir&s;t. They built much upon the prudence of the latter, and the character of patrioti&s;m which he had already acquir|ed. They knew that Marlborough, while he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch credit and authority abroad, was &s;ecretly undermined by his enemies at home. They were told, that a great part of the Briti&s;h nation were offended at &s;eeing the power, influence, and emoluments of government, &s;o long divided between the Duke, the Earl of Godolphin, and their friends. That the mind of the Queen, by the &s;e|cret artifices of a latent faction, was greatly alienated from the intere&s;t of her general, and unea&s;y at the un|controuled power of her trea&s;urer.

The number of their troops, their confidence in their own conduct, the con&s;ternation of the French, and their promi&s;es to the allies to di&s;per&s;e the army of the enemy, and to penetrate into the heart of France, rendered tho&s;e able generals extremely anxious to bring matters, by a battle, to a deci&s;ion.

It was, however, &s;oon after re&s;tored, through the intrigues and influence of Cardinal Wol&s;ey. The Spaniards took Tournay in the year 1618. But having been retaken by Lewis the Fourteenth, in the year 1667, it was rendered, by new fortifications, one of the &s;tronge&s;t places in the Netherlands.

The Mare&s;chal de Villars placed him&s;elf at the head of his left wing. He committed the charge of the right to the Mare&s;chal de Boufflers, who, though his &s;enior, con|&s;ented to act a &s;econd part. After an awful &s;u&s;pence and &s;ilence for near two hours, the battle began at eight of the clock. In a moment the firing extended from wing to wing.

Some battalions giving way before them, were brought back and confirmed in their &s;tation, by the vigilance, courage, and activity of the Mare&s;chal de Boufflers. The Dutch, in their turn, gave ground a little way. Some French battalions, emboldened by their own re&s;i&s;tance, ru&s;hed from their entrenchments, pu&s;hed the enemy from one of their batteries, &s;eized their colours, and regaining their po&s;t, &s;u&s;tained a &s;econd charge. The unexpected ob&s;ti|nacy of the French, in both wings, induced the generals of the confederates to entertain thoughts of de&s;i&s;ting from the attack.

But his affairs were not completely ruined till the fatal battle of Pultowa, which was fought on the eleventh of July. Having re&s;olved to carry the war again&s;t the Czar into the heart of Ru&s;&s;ia, and encouraged by the defection of the Co&s;&s;acks, he precipitately entered the Ukrain.

They found that their &s;afety depended wholly on them&s;elves; and, though the campaign had not proved &s;o fatal to their affairs as they had rea&s;on to apprehend, their wretched &s;tate could promi&s;e nothing from a continuance of the war, but a &s;eries of misfor|tunes. The court of Ver&s;ailles re&s;olved, therefore, to renew their applications for a negociation of peace. This however could not be effected, either &s;uddenly or with ea&s;e. Though the &s;ucce&s;s of the allies had not an|&s;wered their own expectations, the &s;ame difficulties which had fru&s;trated the de&s;ign of the former conferences continued. The very preliminary articles which France had rejected before the opening of the campaign, had become a new bond of union between the confederates; and, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, a new law from which they could not recede. When, therefore, Lewis the Fourteenth demanded pa&s;&s;es for his commi&s;&s;ioners to go to the Hague, they were refu&s;ed by the States-General.

A brief detail of facts, will throw &s;ufficient light on a &s;ubject rendered tedious and perplexed, by the zeal of contending parties. Henry Sacheverell, who kindled this new flame between the Whigs and Tories, was a clergyman, neither eminent in his character, nor ob&s;cure in his profe&s;&s;ion; vehement by nature, a warm zealot from principle, attached to the mo&s;t extravagant doctrines of the high-church, a determined enemy to di&s;&s;enters, to occa&s;ional conformi&s;ts, and their abettors the whole party of the Whigs. Having di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the country by his zeal, and even by his vio|lence, he was called, by a popular election, to a church in Southwark. Having a more exten&s;ive field for propa|gating his doctrines, he became &s;oon to be generally known and followed, by tho&s;e who favoured mo&s;t the

principles of the high-church. On the fifth of Novem|ber of the pre&s;ent year, the anniver&s;ary of the gun-pow|der-plot, having obtained the pulpit at St. Paul's, he de|livered a &s;ermon, before the lord mayor and the court of aldermen, full of tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of complaint and jea|lou&s;y, which were common to him with his whole party. In this di&s;cour&s;e, he inveighed with pa&s;&s;ion, if not with indecency, again&s;t the di&s;&s;enters, and the moderate part of the church of England; and, at the &s;ame time, con|veyed &s;evere &s;trictures upon tho&s;e in power. He incul|cated al&s;o, in &s;trong and vehement terms, the doctrine of pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non-re&s;i&s;tance, which, in its great|e&s;t latitude, was incon&s;i&s;tent with the late revolution<NOTE N="J" PLACE="foot">Journals, Dec. 13.</NOTE>.</P>

The conte&s;ts between leaders, for places of tru&s;t, profit, and power, had been improved into a &s;ettled principle; among their re&s;pective adherents. The two parties be|yond the hope of conviction, had been long per&s;uaded, that their antagoni&s;ts were determined to run into the mo&s;t dreadful extremities, and to ruin the nation. The Tories believed, that the Whigs intended to e&s;tabli&s;h a republican &s;y&s;tem of civil government, and to de&s;troy the church. The Whigs were convinced, that the Tories were re&s;olved to per&s;ecute the di&s;&s;enters, and to place the Pretender on the throne. The reception given to the &s;ermon, and to the opinions formed of the Doctor, were &s;uitable to the extravagant pa&s;&s;ions of the two parties. The Tories extolled him as a per&s;on, who &s;tood alone un&s;ubdued in de&s;ence of the church, now on the brink of ruin. The Whigs gave him the name of a popi&s;h per|&s;ecutor, an enemy to the revolution, a devoted friend to the Pretender.

A few, who thought they had gone too far, from a prudent regard to their own intere&s;t, began dexterou&s;ly to fall down with the tide. The &s;entence, therefore, which was pa&s;&s;ed, if not unequal to the guilt of Sacheverell, was certainly un&s;uitable to the dignity of his accu&s;ers and the &s;olemnity of his trial.

The opening made by Pettekum, the envoy of Hol&s;tein, in the end of the year, induced the court of Ver&s;ailles to offer the &s;ending plenipotentiaries, to any part in Holland or Flan|ders the States General &s;hould appoint, to enter into immediate negociations of peace. They propo&s;ed, in|&s;tead of the preliminaries &s;igned by the allies, in the pre|ceding year, to reduce their own conce&s;&s;ions into a more comprehen&s;ive, but an equally ample form.

On the eighteenth of Au|gu&s;t, he fixed his camp within a league of that city. The count de Staremberg, one of the mo&s;t able generals of the age, commanded the allies.

On the other hand, the Duke de Vendome, whom the caprice of the Duke of Burgundy had rendered u&s;ele&s;s to France, a&s;&s;umed, at the reque&s;t of Philip, the chief command in Spain. The nobility crowded from every &s;ide, with their followers, round the &s;tandard of a general in who&s;e conduct they could con|fide.

<MILESTONE N="1710" UNIT="year"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">State of do|me&s;tic af|fairs.</NOTE> DURING the undeci&s;ive operations of the cam|paign abroad, the &s;tate of affairs at home &s;uffered a very important change. The Duke of Marlborough and the Earl of Godolphin, having defeated, &s;ome years before, the intrigues of Harley in the cabinet, had re|&s;olved to hold, by the means of party, the power which they de&s;paired to po&s;&s;e&s;s by the inclination of the &s;ove|reign. As long as they retained the affections of the Queen, the confidence which their &s;plendid mea&s;ures had acquired from the people, were &s;ufficient to &s;upport them again&s;t the irregular attacks of the two irreconcileable parties, that had harra&s;&s;ed the nation for &s;uch a number of years, with their conte&s;ts and their noi&s;e. But when the violence of the Dutche&s;s of Marlborough had de&s;troy|ed that influence, which &s;he had extended into a kind of tyranny over the timid mind of her mi&s;tre&s;s, they found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;trengthen them&s;elves, by forming a con|nexion with the Whigs. They gained, therefore, the leaders of that party, by admitting them into places of tru&s;t and profit; and, fortified, by this political alliance, they held their &s;overeign in chains. The Queen, unable to extricate her&s;elf from this &s;pecies of captivity, affect|ed to adopt mea&s;ures which &s;he was not permitted to guide.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Steps to|ward a change in the mini&s;try.</NOTE> Though Harley and the followers of his fortune were no &s;trangers to the &s;tate of the Queen's mind, they could form no rea&s;onable expectations, on any exertion of that Prince&s;s for the recovery of her authority. They per|ceived, that a change in the &s;entiments of the people, was nece&s;&s;ary to render effectual the efforts of the &s;ove|reign. The populace, for many years, had been uni|formly gained to the views of party, by the con&s;tant alarms given, from time to time, to their zeal for the prote&s;tant religion. The Whigs, by harping judiciou&s;ly on this &s;tring, had frequently taken the cabinet by &s;torm They had often triumphed over their political opponents by the means of popular clamour, even when that party had formed a great majority in the hou&s;es of parliament<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> The Tories made repeated efforts to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> engine, that had &s;o much annoyed them&s;elves.

propagated with great zeal, ever &s;ince the beginning of the pre&s;ent reign. The eloquence of the pulpit had been joined to the polemical arguments i&s;&s;ued from the pre&s;s. The e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy them&s;elves began, through u&s;e, to believe the doctrine which had been fir&s;t propagated for the purpo&s;es of party. The vulgar gradually gave credit to what they heard &s;o often and &s;o vehemently urged. The Queen her&s;elf, with a credulity not un&s;uit|able to her &s;ex, was alarmed at a tale, which, &s;he thought, was too often repeated not to have &s;ome foundation in fact.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The impru|dence of Godolphin,</NOTE> The imprudence of the Earl of Godolphin was the means of &s;etting fire to a train, that had been laid for &s;e|veral years. Per&s;ecution is always more &s;ucce&s;sful than per&s;ua&s;ion, in confirming &s;peculative tenets in weak minds. The attack upon Dr. Sacheverell, the &s;olemnity and length of his trial, the va&s;t inequality between the accu&s;ers and the accu&s;ed, the vehemence of the Whigs, in throwing the whole weight of government in the &s;cale again&s;t a private per&s;on, rai&s;ed the pity of the people; and that pa&s;&s;ion was improved into acts of violence, by the art, per&s;everance, and clamours of zealots of the high-church party. The current, which had been long changing, ran down with a force, that levelled every thing in its cour&s;e. Harley and his followers added their own weight to its violence. The Queen her&s;elf, encou|raged by the noi&s;e of the populace, fell gradually down with the &s;tream. She had been long di&s;gu&s;ted with the behaviour of Marlborough. She hated the tyranny and feared the violence of his wife. She con&s;idered her&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s a kind of pri&s;oner in the hands of a family, who had, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n a manner, cloathed them&s;elves with the whole authority <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">f the crown, and &s;truck the &s;ceptre from her hands.

him&s;elf in the battle of Almanza. The influence of his &s;i&s;ter, more, perhaps, than his merit, had recommended Hill to the attention of the Queen; and &s;he &s;hewed an inclination to rai&s;e him to the command of a regiment of dragoons, vacant by the death of the Earl of E&s;&s;ex. The Duke of Marlborough, who had uninterruptedly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed the di&s;po&s;al of all military promotions, oppo&s;ed, with ob&s;tinacy, the advancement of Hill, as the brother of a woman, who had rendered her&s;elf odious to him&s;elf and his family. He retired to the country. He threatened to re&s;ign the command of the army. He employed his friends to terrify the Queen and her favourite, with ad|dre&s;&s;es from the parliament. The Earl of Sunderland, the Duke's &s;on-in-law, then &s;ecretary of &s;tate, had form|ed a de&s;ign to procure a vote of the commons, to remove Mrs. Ma&s;ham from the Queen's pre&s;ence and &s;ervice<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Jan. 23, 1710.</NOTE>. Apprized of this intended violence, Hill entreated the Queen to de&s;i&s;t from her purpo&s;e in his favour. She complied with his reque&s;t, for the time. But it became evident, that &s;he was re&s;olved to &s;eize the fir&s;t favourable opportunity of ridding her&s;elf of &s;ervants whom &s;he now con&s;idered as tyrants<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. d'Angleterre.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">ha&s;ten the fall of the party.</NOTE> The flame which had &s;eized the nation, upon the trail of Sacheverell, &s;oon furni&s;hed the enemies of the family of Marlborough with the means of dive&s;ting them of their power. Harley and his a&s;&s;ociates having free acce&s;s to the Queen, through her favourite, turned events, as they gradually ro&s;e, to their own advantage. The changes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> which &s;oon after became general, were begun in the mid|dle of April.

They de&s;cended from general ob&s;ervations on parties, to accu&s;ations of particular per&s;ons. They affirmed, that the mini&s;try, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of one fa|mily, had excluded all others from every influence and power in the &s;tate; while they held the Sovereign her&s;elf in the mo&s;t abject &s;lavery.

A di&s;pute about a mi&s;tre&s;s, or rather concern|ing a child, which neither cho&s;e to own, had interrupted their intimacy, before St. John had been advanced, through the fall of the Whig-mini&s;try, to the office of &s;ecretary of &s;tate. The latter, therefore, was hardly prevailed upon, by his French friend, to recommend him as an object worthy of the genero&s;ity of the crown. He, however, mentioned the ca&s;e of Gui&s;card; and five hundred pounds a year was ordered for him, by the Queen. Harley, not only reduced the pen&s;ion to four hundred pounds, but even declined to place it on any fixed e&s;tabli&s;hment. The pretended Marquis endeavour|ed to obtain redre&s;s from the Queen. But all acce&s;s to her per&s;on was denied. Reduced to di&s;tre&s;s, by his pro|fligacy, and offended at men who had been once his friends, he endeavoured to reconcile him&s;elf to his own country, by betraying to the court of France the coun&s;els of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the Empe|ror</NOTE> During the&s;e &s;ecret tran&s;actions in Britain, the face of public affairs in Europe &s;uffered a very important change.

But that temper of mind &s;ubjected his coun&s;els to all the inconveniencies re&s;ulting from precipitation and violence. An ob&s;tinacy, that bore the appearance of firm|ne&s;s, ran through his whole conduct. He was, however, a Prince po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of virtue; and his reign was one con|tinued &s;eries of &s;ucce&s;s and good fortune. He &s;aw all Lombardy conquered by his arms, Piedmont delivered, Hungary pacified, Naples and a great part of the Ne|therlands reduced to obedience. His death &s;uddenly changed the whole &s;tate of affairs. The war undertaken by the grand alliance, for pre&s;erving the balance of Eu|rope, was now likely to de&s;troy it for ever; and men, who judged of the future by the pa&s;t, began to dread the revival of the irre&s;i&s;table power of the Emperor Charles the Fifth, in the per&s;on of a Prince of his family<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. d'Angleterre, tom. iii.</NOTE>.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The allies bent on war.</NOTE> The intentions of the Queen were well under&s;tood by her parliament.

The news of the Emperor's death had not rai&s;ed the &s;ame pacific di&s;po&s;ition in Holland. A re&s;olu|tion was formed, on the contrary, to pro&s;ecute the war, with &s;till greater vigour. The mini&s;ter of the late Em|peror, tho&s;e of Savoy, Portugal, and the German Princes, were all eager for a continuance of ho&s;tilities. The emoluments derived from the war, were greater than their expectations from peace. The generals, and tho&s;e who furni&s;hed the troops, were equally intere&s;ted, upon this &s;ubject. The fir&s;t were &s;wayed by glory, and, per|haps, the le&s;s dignified motive of advantage. The lat|ter yielded to profit alone. The intere&s;t of both was another name for the common cau&s;e. This was the great chain, which kept together the confederacy; and not the pre&s;ervation of the balance or the liberties of Europe.

But the death of the Emperor, while it ha&s;tened the approach of peace, ob&s;tructed the operations of war. A well-grounded fear, that the French and the parti&s;ans of the Electors of Ba|varia and Cologn, might endeavour to di&s;turb the elec|tion of a new Emperor, obliged the Prince of Savoy to march, with the greate&s;t part of the German troops, to the banks of the Rhine. The Mare&s;chal de Villars, &s;trongly po&s;ted behind his lines at Arleux, di&s;appointed all the efforts of Marlborough, for bringing things to the deci&s;ion of a battle.

with his predece&s;&s;or in office. Both were forced to adopt a line of conduct diametrically oppo&s;ite to their principles and views. The Earl of Godolphin, though a Tory and Jacobite, was obliged, from the circum&s;tances of the times, to place him&s;elf at the head of the Whigs. The pre&s;ent trea&s;urer, though a Pre&s;byterian, and attached to the hou&s;e of Hannover, was con&s;idered as the leader of the Tories, and a favourer of the claims of the Pretender. The bulk of mankind, ever deceived by out|ward &s;hew, judged of the two mini&s;ters by their own pa&s;|&s;ions and prejudices. Godolphin, when in corre&s;pondence with the court of St. Germains, was violently prai&s;ed by many, and as extravagantly condemned by others, for his attachment to the Prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Oxford was &s;till more unfortunate than his rival. He was &s;uppo&s;ed, by the court of Hannover it&s;elf, as well as by the people, a determined friend to the excluded family; even when he u&s;ed all his efforts again&s;t their eventual re&s;toration, and laid him&s;elf in the du&s;t at the feet of the parliament|ary heirs of the crown, his profe&s;&s;ions were con&s;idered as &s;o many baits to deceive. But, in a happy enthu&s;ia&s;m for his own religious opinions, or, perhaps, ultimately to gain the favour of that family mo&s;t likely to &s;ucceed, he &s;eemed determined to exclude all re&s;entment, and to &s;hew that he was a much more &s;incere friend than his adver|&s;aries to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Electoral family.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He di&s;co|vers by an accident,</NOTE> In this di&s;po&s;ition of mind, the Earl of Oxford was as much afraid of the Tories, as he was of the principal Whigs.

Though a caution, which his enemies called political timidity, might pre|&s;ent the Duke of Marlborough from adopting violent mea&s;ures, there was no &s;ecurity again&s;t the &s;chemes of the Prince: A man of great abilities, unconfined by prin|ciple, &s;anguine in his views; as determined in the ex|ecution of his de&s;igns, as he was bold in undertaking the mo&s;t de&s;perate mea&s;ures. He kept one great object, his own ambition, perpetually in view. He pu&s;hed forward, in one direct line, to that di&s;tingui&s;hed point. He re|garded ob&s;tacles only as to their difficulty of being re|moved. He valued little the means he u&s;ed; as he was taught by his pride that every thing calculated to extend his own greatne&s;s was allowable, if not ju&s;t. In this di&s;|po&s;ition of Eugene's mind, the only &s;afety of the mini&s;try con&s;i&s;ted in his ab&s;ence from London. But the &s;low coun&s;els of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria proved, according to cu&s;tom, highly favourable to their enemies. The Prince was detained at the Hague, till the &s;ea&s;on of his being u&s;eful in London was pa&s;t. The Earl of Oxford, ap|prized of the de&s;igns of his enemy, had time to fortify

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A majority made in the hou&s;e of lords.</NOTE> The Earl of Oxford, long perplexed with difficulties, became at length re&s;olute, through his very fears. He di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the Duke of Marlborough from all his employ|ments. But this mea&s;ure was not &s;ufficient to &s;ecure him again&s;t the de&s;igns of the Whigs. Though the hou&s;e of commons were &s;ub&s;ervient to his wi&s;hes, there was al&s;o a nece&s;&s;ity of gaining a majority to the mea&s;ures of the court in the hou&s;e of lords. The excluded party had acquired courage, as well as reputation, under the ap|probation of one branch of the legi&s;lature. To deprive them of that advantage, was to pur&s;ue with effect the victory already gained by the mini&s;try, by the removal of the Duke. A &s;udden re&s;olution was taken to command the deliberations of the hou&s;e of lords, by the creation of twelve new peers. The mea&s;ure was deemed arbitrary and dangerous; but it could not be called illegal.

They were no &s;trangers to the principles, or rather the views, of the Earl of Oxford, in favour of the family of Hannover. They knew, that to defeat the peace was to ruin the mini&s;ter. Nothing but the fear of falling into the hands of the Whigs had induced them to &s;upport the court. Had the leaders of the latter party followed a more moderate line of conduct, the Earl of Oxford mu&s;t have fallen by the hands of his &s;uppo&s;ed friends. In the preceding autumn, the adherents of the excluded family had di&s;covered, that they could form no hopes to their cau&s;e on the favour of the lord-trea&s;urer. Neither the Queen, nor her favourite, now Lady Ma&s;ham, were ignorant of this circum&s;tance; but both dreaded what they called the tyranny of the Whigs, &s;hould the lord-trea&s;urer, by the de&s;ertion of the Tories, be forced to re&s;ign.</P>

That then the crown might be &s;ettled by the Whigs, and the war be carried on with redoubled vigour. The&s;e ob&s;ervations devolved the di&s;cour&s;e on the Baron de Both|mar. He averred, that though the di&s;orders might be the &s;ame, the &s;ame remedies were impracticable; that the nation was not &s;ufficiently prepared for a revolution; that the prejudices of the vulgar, the great engine in &s;uch daring enterpri&s;es, were &s;till upon the &s;ide of the enemy; that though the Queen was &s;u&s;pected of favouring a Po|pi&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;or, &s;he her&s;elf was a &s;trict Prote&s;tant; that the jealou&s;y concerning religion was too feeble, on account of the di&s;tance of the danger; that though circum&s;tances had even been more favourable, the experiment would be extremely dangerous; that a mi&s;carriage would inevi|tably ruin the undertaking, load the family of Hannover with the public hatred, and exclude them from the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion to the crown.

The avowed object of his journey was to receive his ultimate in&s;tructions to conclude the treaty, as &s;oon as the King of Spain's an&s;wer &s;hould be received. When his an&s;wer was, accordingly received, in the beginning of June, the Queen agreed to a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms. The conditions of this indulgence to France, was the immediate delivery of Dunkirk to the Briti&s;h troops; and the punctual exe|cution of the article concerning the union of France and Spain. She propo&s;ed, at the &s;ame time, that a Dutch garri&s;on &s;hould be introduced into Cambray. The French King, deriving &s;pirit from her eagerne&s;s, rejected this demand with a degree of di&s;dain.

The Queen, her&s;elf, frightened at the real or &s;uppo&s;ed con&s;piracies of the Whigs, was anxious to end the war.

The example of Great Britain, he affirmed, would be &s;oon followed by the confederates. The Kings of Por|tugal and Pru&s;&s;ia, he &s;aid, as well as the Duke of Savoy, and the Dutch, were too prudent to continue the war after the &s;eparation of &s;uch a powerful ally as Great Bri|tain; and, &s;hould the Emperor and empire &s;acrifice their convenience and intere&s;t to their re&s;entment, he a&s;&s;ured her, that they would &s;oon drop a conte&s;t which they could not maintain with any effect. The Earl of Oxford oppo&s;ed the advice of Bolingbroke, to avoid giving of|fence to the Elector of Hannover. Though he was attach|ed from principle to that Prince, he was apprehen&s;ive of being called to an account whenever he &s;hould a&s;cend the

This was the cau&s;e of all tho&s;e delays and unea&s;ine&s;&s;es which might have been prevented by a definitive treaty between Great Britain and France. This conduct was extremely impolitic in the mini&s;ter, as it gave an appearance of ti|midity to his mea&s;ures; a circum&s;tance which expo&s;ed him to all the machinations and intrigues of his own ene|mies and tho&s;e of the peace<NOTE N="Y" PLACE="foot">M. de Torcy, tom. ii.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Terms &s;et|tled be|tween him and de Tor|cy.</NOTE> When Bolingbroke arrived at Paris, he entered into conferences with the Marquis de Torcy on the object of his emba&s;&s;y. The two mini&s;ters, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of unlimited powers from their re&s;pective courts, &s;oon agreed: That the Duke of Savoy and his de&s;cendants &s;hould be called to the throne of Spain, in default of King Philip and his male po&s;terity. That this &s;ub&s;titution &s;hould be in&s;erted in all the public acts, with regard to the renunciation of Philip's right to the crown of France. That the renun|ciation it&s;elf &s;hould be regi&s;tered in the books of the par|liament of Paris, and admitted &s;olemnly by the cortes or &s;tates of Ca&s;tile and Arragon. That the ce&s;&s;ion of Sicily to the Duke of Savoy &s;hould for the pre&s;ent remain a &s;e|cret for various rea&s;ons. But that he &s;hould never be &s;uffered to alienate that i&s;land for any other territory. The article of the barrier to this favoured Prince was not &s;o ea&s;ily &s;ettled. The French mini&s;ter refu&s;ed to grant more for that purpo&s;e than Exilles, Fene&s;trelles, and the valley of Pragelas. This whole affair was therefore re|ferred to the general congre&s;s at Utrecht. The two &s;e|cretaries of Great Britain and France having &s;ettled the&s;e terms, the Vi&s;count Bolingbroke had an audience of the French King. He was received with the utmo&s;t polite|ne&s;s by that Prince; and was treated by the whole court with a re&s;pect &s;uitable to the earne&s;t de&s;ire of the king|dom for peace. The ce&s;&s;ation of arms was prolonged for four months; and Bolingbroke, having left Prior to manage the affairs of his nation in France, returned to London, highly &s;atisfied with the &s;ucce&s;s of his em|ba&s;&s;y<NOTE N="Z" PLACE="foot">M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> de Torcy, tom. ii.</NOTE>.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">States eager for peace.</NOTE> The change of affairs in Flanders had rendered the confederates &s;en&s;ible that they were incapable to maintain the war &s;hould Great Britain de&s;ert the grand alliance. The Dutch, who had mo&s;t to lo&s;e by a continuation of ho&s;tilities, were the fir&s;t who &s;eriou&s;ly thought of peace. The defeat at Denain, the &s;ub&s;equent misfortunes, the di&s;appointment of the projects of the Prince of Savoy, had bla&s;ted their hopes and humbled their pride. Their eyes were opened to the true &s;tate of their affairs. They de&s;cended at once from that haughtine&s;s with which they had been in&s;pired by the &s;ucce&s;s of the war. In&s;tead of pre&s;cribing terms to the hou&s;e of Bourbon, they &s;olicited the good offices of Great Britain, for renewing the con|ferences, which had been long interrupted by their own ob&s;tinacy. They dropt their preten&s;ions of receiving all the an&s;wers of the French plenipotentiaries in writing. The latter, therefore, agreed to renew the conferences, upon condition that the Queen of Great Britain's &s;peech to her parliament &s;hould be admitted as the plan of the treaty. The mini&s;ters of the other allies were alarmed at the pu&s;illanimity of the Dutch. Count Zinzendorff, the Imperial mini&s;ter, repeated his exhortations and pro|mi&s;es. He a&s;&s;ured them, that the Prince of Savoy was on his march to fight Villars. That he was &s;ure of vic|tory. That, as there was no ri&s;k in &s;u&s;pending the con|ferences, the States ought to temporize, by waiting for the re&s;ult of events<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Swift's Four Years. De Torcy, tom. ii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An incident interrupts the con|ferences.</NOTE> Zinzendorff prevailed. The conferences, under vari|ous pretences, were delayed. But when time brought no favourable change, the Dutch fell into their former fears. They redoubled their &s;olicitations for the renewal of the conferences of Utrecht. A &s;illy quarrel between the &s;er|vants of M. Menager, one of the French plenipotenti|aries, and tho&s;e of the Count de Rechteren, deputy of the province of Overy&s;&s;el, interrupted again the great work of peace. The French King took advantage of the folly of Rechteren, as it was not his intere&s;t to con|&s;et with the allies till he had &s;ettled his mea&s;ures with the Vi&s;count Bolingbroke. The pretence it&s;elf was plau|&s;ible. He in&s;i&s;ted that the States &s;hould declare whether Rechteren followed their orders in his in&s;olent conduct,
<PB N="514" REF="537">
or whether he had pur&s;ued the dictates of a pa&s;&s;ionate mind, inflamed by the arts of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. If he acted in obedience to his ma&s;ters, there was no &s;afety, he &s;aid, for his mini&s;ters at Utrecht. If he had no guide but his own pa&s;&s;ion, the States were called upon to di&s;a|vow the conduct of a &s;ervant who had abu&s;ed their con|fidence. The French King therefore told them, that Rechteren &s;hould be recalled by his con&s;tituents, and ano|ther deputy be appointed in his place. This dictatorial conduct, &s;o contrary to the abject behaviour of the court of France in the year 1709, was not capable to rai&s;e the indignation of the States. The haughtine&s;s, which a&s;|&s;umed the name of &s;pirit at that period, had vani&s;hed with their good fortune; and they &s;uffered an enemy whom they de&s;pi&s;ed to retort upon them their own wan|ton in&s;olence with impunity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen interferes for the Dutch.</NOTE> The abject behaviour of the States was, at pre&s;ent, of &s;ome advantage to their affairs. Their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the French reconciled the court of Great Britain to their in|tere&s;t. The re&s;entment of the Briti&s;h nation cea&s;ed, with the ob&s;tinacy of the Dutch. The mini&s;try re&s;olved to interfere in their cau&s;e. They pre&s;&s;ed, therefore, the court of France to a &s;eparate peace. They de&s;ired them to regi&s;ter immediately the renunciations, as on them the peace of Europe depended. That, upon the fulfilling of this e&s;&s;ential article, the Queen of Great Britain &s;hould declare, that &s;he could obtain no other plan but that of|fered by France. That it was the bu&s;ine&s;s of the con|federates to determine upon this head. That they &s;hould have three months to con&s;ider; but that the French King &s;hould be no longer obliged to grant even the&s;e terms, after the expiration of the time. The Queen in&s;i&s;ted, in return, with the court of Ver&s;ailles, to depart from their claims, on the re&s;titution of Tournay<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">M. de Torcy, tom. ii.</NOTE>. That town, &s;he &s;aid, as it was the great object of the States, was al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary to their barrier. Though Lewis had re|&s;olved to retain Tournay, he yielded prudently to her reque&s;t. He &s;ound, that by the bad &s;tate of the Queen's health, there was rea&s;on to fear &s;he might die in the mid&s;t of an unfini&s;hed war. He knew that the mini&s;try mu&s;t fall with her life.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Secret views of the Queen</NOTE> This prudential conce&s;&s;ion of Lewis the Fourteenth, &s;moothed the way for a treaty which was not de&s;tined to be &s;oon concluded. But though the clande&s;tine mea&s;ures, for re&s;toring peace, employed much of the time of Queen Anne, a part of her attention was turned to views that were &s;till more &s;ecret. Tho&s;e who were mo&s;t about her per&s;on, perceiving her inclinations, urged her perpe|tually with regard to the intere&s;t of the Pretender. She &s;eemed willing to favour his views. But &s;he perceived ob&s;tacles in his way, which he him&s;elf had not the &s;trength of mind to remove. In her own attachment to the church of England, &s;he &s;ignified her inclinations that the Pretender &s;hould relinqui&s;h Popery, and place him&s;elf in a capacity of being &s;erved. When &s;he was urged, by the Duke of Buckingham, to endeavour to break the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the Prote&s;tant line, her an&s;wer, though it conveyed a regard for her brother, was &s;uitable to good &s;en&s;e and prudence. <Q REND="inline">"How can I &s;erve him,"</Q> &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"my Lord?

That he was willing the pre&s;ent te&s;ts, &s;o far as they regarded Popery, &s;hould continue; and, as he entertained no prejudice again&s;t the doctrines of the church of England, he was ready to have no &s;er|vants but &s;uch as were of the Prote&s;tant per&s;ua&s;ion<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1712.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections.</NOTE> The&s;e profe&s;&s;ions might be hone&s;t; but they were an irrefragable proof of weakne&s;s. A man who relinqui&s;hed his hopes of a great kingdom; for a &s;peculative tenet of faith, di&s;covered a degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m that ought never to be tru&s;ted. In&s;incerity it&s;elf is le&s;s a crime in a prince than folly. He who wi&s;hes to govern nations, mu&s;t rule them through their principles; otherwi&s;e his government becomes a tyranny, and only la&s;ts as long as it is not op|po&s;ed. Among a people accu&s;tomed to monarchy, the Sovereign only is capable of &s;haking his own throne. To differ from his &s;ubjects, in their religious opinions, is al|mo&s;t the only prerogative which he may not, without danger, employ. Of all mankind, HE has the lea&s;t right to be &s;ingular in his faith. If he is not willing to go to heaven in the &s;ame way with his people, they will &s;caree acknowledge the legality of his authority on earth. That public affection, which is the chief &s;upport of his throne mu&s;t be changed for &s;u&s;picion and jealou&s;y. A mutual di&s;tru&s;t prevails, which will &s;oon degenerate into that un|forgiving aver&s;ion, that invariably follows a difference of faith, in feeble minds. When &s;ociety is even mellowed down into an indifference, which borders on infidelity

the wor&s;t con&s;equences are to be expected and feared. Indignation again&s;t the weakne&s;s of a bigot will, even then, &s;upply the place of religious zeal; and violence it&s;elf becomes ju&s;t, in a certain degree, when it is op|po&s;ed to folly.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Tories urge the Pretender</NOTE> The generality of the Tories, in their vehement zeal for the hereditary de&s;cent of the crown, overlooked the attachment of the Pretender to the Popi&s;h faith.

of the war could &s;ugge&s;t no demands that were not likely to be granted, by an enemy reduced to the la&s;t extremity. The French nation, un&s;ucce&s;sful in all their efforts, were broken by di&s;a&s;ters. Their &s;overeign, de&s;titute of re|&s;ources for action, became timid and undeci&s;ive in his coun&s;els. He had implored the pity of the confederates, in a manner that, by expo&s;ing his own weakne&s;s, contri|buted to augment their demands. In&s;tead of deriving &s;pi|rit from indignation and de&s;pair, the court of Ver&s;ailles yielded to tho&s;e unmanly complaints, that deprive even misfortune it&s;elf of regret. In this untoward &s;tate of their affairs, the fate of the hou&s;e of Bourbon depended upon the Queen of Great Britain; and, as the humanity, which ought ever to be extended to private di&s;tre&s;s, is frequently &s;acrificed to utility in public tran&s;actions, &s;he could &s;carce be blamed for making a more rigorous u&s;e of the advantages which fortune had placed in her hands.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and reflec|tions.</NOTE> But though more &s;plendid conditions might certainly have been obtained, the peace of Utrecht was neither di&s;honourable nor di&s;advantageous. Great Britain, it is true, bore the greate&s;t part of the weight of the war. But &s;he was manife&s;tly the &s;ole arbitre&s;s of peace. She impo&s;ed terms on the victors, as well as on the van|qui&s;hed. Without gratifying the pride of France, &s;he checked the in&s;olence of the confederates. She favoured tho&s;e the mo&s;t, who fir&s;t acquie&s;ced in the plan &s;he pro|po&s;ed. She treated with neglect, or puni&s;hed with di&s;ap|pointment, &s;uch as were either ob&s;tinate or &s;low. The advantages which &s;he obtained for her&s;elf, though nei|ther adequate to her victories nor her expence, were &s;olid, and even &s;plendid. She &s;ecured the dominion of the Mediterranean, by obtaining Gibraltar and Minorca. She &s;trengthened her limits and extended her dominions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> America.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">on the peace of Utrecht.</NOTE> With regard to the confederates, the mo&s;t of them were highly &s;atisfied, and none had any great rea&s;on to complain. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia obtained all his demands. The Duke of Savoy was recompen&s;ed beyond his mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes. He had obtained the ce&s;&s;ion of Savoy, the di&s;trict of Nice, with all that he had received in Italy, from the Emperor Leopold. He was rai&s;ed to the regal title and to the throne of Sicily; and he was eventually to &s;ucceed to the crown of Spain, in default of Philip the Fifth and his i&s;&s;ue-male. The King of Portugal had con|tributed little to the carrying on of the war, and his de|mands from the peace were few, and, without he&s;itation, granted. Luxembourg, Namur, Charleroi, together with the other cities already in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, were given, as a barrier, to the States. Their commerce with France was placed on the foundation e&s;tabli&s;hed by the tariff of 1664. With regard to the Empire, the Rhine was to form its limits on the &s;ide of France. All forti|fications, either po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed or rai&s;ed by the French, be|yond that river, were to be re&s;tored to the Emperor, or de&s;troyed. The kingdom of Naples and the dutchy of Milan were ceded for ever to his Imperial Maje&s;ty; and the re&s;t of the dominions of Italy, that had changed ma&s;|ters in the cour&s;e of the war, were to return to their for|mer &s;overeigns. There was a con&s;iderable difference, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, between the&s;e terms and tho&s;e offered by France in the year 1709. But a change of circum|&s;tances may ju&s;tify an alteration of &s;entiments. Without abandoning the project of reducing the too great power of the hou&s;e of Bourbon, the Briti&s;h mini&s;try might al|lege, that there was an equal nece&s;&s;ity for pre&s;cribing limits to the va&s;t claims of the family of Au&s;tria.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Perilous &s;ituation of the Earl of Oxford.</NOTE> The lord-trea&s;urer obtained a triumph over his ene|mies, by concluding the treaty of Utrecht. But he &s;till &s;tood upon very dangerous ground. Di&s;tru&s;ted equally by both &s;ides, he was de&s;titute of friends; and his whole &s;ecurity re&s;ted in the implacable jealou&s;y of the two par|ties, who were alike his enemies. In this tottering &s;itua|tion, he endeavoured to &s;upport him&s;elf, by flattering the Tories in private, and by taking publickly the ground of the Whigs. In the political farce, he was, in &s;ome

mea&s;ure, the &s;ole actor; and the populace were the &s;pec|tators, who were to decide his merit, and even his fate. To the common people, the appeal of the rivals for power had been made, for many years. The terrors of the vulgar for Popery, and their principles in favour of the Prote&s;tant religion, had been the great &s;upport of the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed form of government. The bulk of the nation were hitherto favourable to the mini&s;try. To retain their confidence was a matter of the la&s;t importance to the Earl of Oxford; as, by the triennial act, the pre&s;ent parlia|ment was near its end. The Whigs, to influence the approaching elections, had propagated, with more a&s;&s;idu|ity than &s;ucce&s;s, an opinion, that the Queen and her &s;er|vants were irrecoverably in the intere&s;t of the Pretender. To prevent the bad con&s;equences of this dangerous im|pre&s;&s;ion, was a mea&s;ure of nece&s;&s;ity; and it employed the whole attention of the leaders of the Tories.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He is hated by both par|ties.</NOTE> The bolde&s;t and the lea&s;t politic propo&s;ed the pa&s;&s;ing of a &s;eptennial bill, as the be&s;t and mo&s;t deci&s;ive means of &s;ecuring the continuance of their own power<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, 1713.</NOTE>. The lord-trea&s;urer was too timid, or, perhaps, too pru|dent, to follow their advice. He perceived, that a mea|&s;ure &s;o unpopular would deprive him of the &s;upport of the vulgar, and place an uncontrolable power in the hands of the high-flying Tories. The cabinet-council were his enemies. He knew, that the mo&s;t vehement of tho&s;e who &s;upported his mea&s;ures in the two hou&s;es, wi&s;hed only for the continuance of their pre&s;ent influence in parliament: That, &s;hould they attain their purpo&s;e, they would be willing to join with his avowed enemies, the Whigs, and to &s;end him to the Tower<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">Ibid.

He en|deavoured to per&s;uade them, that all his mea&s;ures tended to the accompli&s;hment of their wi&s;hes and views. But he had the misfortune to be as little believed by the excluded family, as he was by the legal heirs of the crown. His caution, his &s;low mea&s;ures, his my&s;terious character, were by no means calculated to create in others any confi|dence in his conduct. His only hold of his power, was
<PB N="534" REF="557">
the a&s;cendant which he obtained over the Queen. By terrifying that timid Prince&s;s with reports of danger, and by in&s;inuating artfully, that &s;he could be &s;afe only in his own hands, he reduced her into a &s;tate of depen|dence on him&s;elf, and generally &s;ub&s;ervient to all his de&s;igns<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">MSS. pa&s;&s;im.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His &s;ecret views and intrigues.</NOTE> In one important in&s;tance, her habitual obedience to the mini&s;ter is &s;aid to have yielded to her prejudices. To &s;ecure him&s;elf with the populace, the lord-trea&s;urer re&s;olved to take the ground of the Whigs. The danger of the Prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, from the Queen and her &s;er|vants, had been long a favourite topic with that party. They were at great pains to inform the public, that the courts of London and Hannover were upon the very wor&s;t terms. Though this was a notorious fact, they had hi|therto found it difficult to per&s;uade the populace on that head. To remove every impre&s;&s;ion of this kind, the mi|ni&s;ter formed a de&s;ign of inducing the Queen to a&s;&s;ure her parliament, in her &s;peech from the throne, that the utmo&s;t harmony &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between her and the pre&s;ump|tive heirs of her crown. He even attempted to reconcile the Jacobites to the propriety of this mea&s;ure.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">April 9th. Her &s;peech to her par|liament.</NOTE> Swayed by the&s;e arguments, or yielding to her own fears, the Queen at length con&s;ented. She opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, on the ninth of April, with a &s;peech from the throne. She informed the two hou&s;es that the negociations of peace were brought to a happy conclu&s;ion. She mentioned what &s;he had done for the &s;ecurity of the Prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. She expre&s;&s;ed her hopes, that the perfect friend&s;hip which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between her and the hou&s;e of Hannover, would effectually di&s;appoint &s;uch per&s;ons as made a merit of &s;eparating their intere&s;ts. She demanded of the commons the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies. She earne&s;tly recommended the cultivating of the arts of peace, as the be&s;t means for repairing the lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained by the enormous expence of the war. She complained of the licence of the pre&s;s, and the dangerous growth of the impious practice of duelling. She mentioned the nece&s;|&s;ity of re&s;training both the&s;e evils, with new laws; as the old were inadequate to that &s;alutary purpo&s;e. She left, &s;he &s;aid, the force nece&s;&s;ary for the protection of the nation, to the wi&s;dom of her parliament. As for her|&s;elf &s;he wanted no protection but the loyalty of her peo|ple; no guarantee but the intere&s;t &s;he had in their hearts. Having recommended unanimity in their councils, and re|que&s;ted them to u&s;e their endeavours to calm the minds of her people, &s;he concluded with a reflection on the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Whigs di&s;concerted</NOTE> This judicious &s;peech di&s;concerted the Whigs in all their projects.

Without the pre&s;ence of one of the family, they &s;olemnly averred, that the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion mu&s;t inevitably be defeated. This reque&s;t they had frequently made, to no purpo&s;e, before the meeting of parliament.

The commons granted the de|manded &s;upplies<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Journals, April 13.</NOTE>. They reduced the troops and navy, according to the directions of the court. They gained the army, by allowing half-pay to the officers. They &s;ecured their influence with their con&s;tituents, by reducing the land-tax to two &s;hillings in the pound. In the mid&s;t of this attention to the nation, they &s;hewed their attachment to the mini&s;try.

A violent debate aro&s;e between the friends of the mini&s;ter and the leaders of the Whigs. The fir&s;t endeavoured to prove, that a great advantage would re&s;ult to the nation from a free commerce with France. The latter affirmed, that a trade with that kingdom would prove extremely pre|judicial to the woollen, &s;ilk, and paper manufactories; and above all, to the commerce with Portugal, which brought annually &s;o much bullion into the kingdom. The friends of the mini&s;try deduced their arguments from an enumeration of the va&s;t quantities of Briti&s;h commodi|ties exported to France before the two la&s;t wars. The Whigs averred that &s;ince the Revolution, the &s;tate of commerce was entirely changed. That France had &s;et up and encouraged woollen manufactures of her own.

The Queen, how|ever, paid an equivalent, in money, to the di&s;mi&s;&s;ed officers. The mea&s;ure furni&s;hed the artful with an object of clamour, and terrified the credulous and timid.

On this occa&s;ion the Earl of Ox|ford made a motion, which &s;eemed prepo&s;terous, as the motive was then unknown.

Foreigners, judging from the fears of the friends of the hou&s;e of Hannover, formed no doubt of his &s;peedy re&s;toration to the throne. They concluded, that his &s;i&s;ter was heartily in his intere&s;t: That her &s;er|vants were forming effectual &s;chemes for &s;ecuring his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion to the crown. The Duke of Lorrain, gained by the &s;oftne&s;s of his manners, touched with his misfortunes, or forming hopes upon his future pro&s;pects, entered hear|tily into his cau&s;e. Perceiving the indifference of France, he endeavoured to gain the Imperial court to the intere&s;t of his gue&s;t. He even directed his envoy at the court of Vienna to a&s;k for him in marriage one of the daughters of the Emperor Jo&s;eph. Charles the Sixth was &s;o little offended at this reque&s;t, that the only objection he made was the di&s;parity in their age. The arch-dutche&s;s was but twelve years old; but the Pretender was in his &s;ix and twentieth year. The Emperor recommended his own &s;i&s;ter, as a more &s;uitable match. He, however, prudently ob&s;erved, that the times were too critical to come to a determination on this head. But that, when an occa&s;ion &s;hould offer, he was much di&s;po&s;ed to give to the Chevalier de St. George &s;olid marks of his e&s;teem and regard<NOTE N="R" PLACE="foot">Stuart-papers, Feb. 22, 1714.</NOTE>.</P>

Her re&s;entment had placed her in the &s;cale of the Pretender, as far as &s;he was permitted by her own timidity and jealou&s;y. The principal object of Bolingbroke was to perpetuate his influence; that of Marlborough to regain his former power. The fir&s;t knew that he could not &s;upport him|&s;elf alone, after the removal of the lord-trea&s;urer. The latter had no objection to his entering into any mea&s;ures, &s;hould that mini&s;ter be removed from the cabinet. The views of both were turned to their own intere&s;t.

The&s;e ob&s;ervations may be applied, with a degree of ju&s;tice, to the Earl of Oxford; who carried into his public conduct, all the narrowne&s;s of his private character.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;u&s;ion in the cabi|net.</NOTE> Though the Vi&s;count Bolingbroke had the addre&s;s to remove the lord-trea&s;urer, he was not able to &s;eize the reins which he had &s;truck from his hands. Wild, vi&s;io|nary, and vehement, in all his projects, he had not fore|&s;een difficulties, or he was found incapable to &s;urmount them, when they came. During three days of anarchy and confu&s;ion in the cabinet, the minds of men were agi|tated with the vici&s;&s;itudes of hopes and fear. The Queen her&s;elf, in a dangerous &s;tate of health before, had in|crea&s;ed the violence of her di&s;temper, by the agitation of her &s;pirits. Having a&s;&s;i&s;ted at a council of her principal &s;ervants, in the night of the twenty-ninth of July, &s;he became perplexed, beyond mea&s;ure, at their differences in opinion, and want of deci&s;ion. The u&s;ual di&s;charge, from an impo&s;thumation in her leg, was &s;topped. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 1. Death of the Queen.</NOTE> The gouty matter, tran&s;lating it&s;elf to the brain, threw her into a dozing in&s;en&s;ibility, in which &s;he expired, at Ken|&s;ington, on Sunday the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, about &s;even of the clock in the morning. In a tran&s;ient interval of her lethargy, &s;he delivered the trea&s;urer's &s;taff to the Duke of Shrew&s;bury, who had been recommended to that high office by &s;uch of the privy council as were a&s;&s;embled, up|on the occa&s;ion, at Ken&s;ington.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Her per&s;on and charac|ter.</NOTE> Thus died Anne Stuart, Queen of Great Britain and Ireland, in the fiftieth year of her age and thirteenth of her reign. In the per&s;on &s;he was of a middle &s;tature, and before &s;he bore children well-made. Her hair was dark, her complexion &s;anguine, her features &s;trong, but not ir|regular, her whole countenance more dignified than a|greeable. In the accompli&s;hments of the mind, as a wo|man, &s;he was not deficient. She under&s;tood mu&s;ic: She loved painting: She had even &s;ome ta&s;&s;e for works of ge|nius. She was always generous, &s;ometimes liberal, but never profu&s;e. Like the re&s;t of her family, &s;he was good-natured,
<PB N="588" REF="613">
to a degree of weakne&s;s. Indolent in her di&s;|po&s;ition, timid by nature, devoted to the company of her favourites, ea&s;ily led. She po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the virtues of her father, except political courage. She was &s;ubject to all his weakne&s;&s;es, except enthu&s;ia&s;m in religion. She was jea|lous of her authority, and &s;ullenly irreconcilable toward tho&s;e who treated either her&s;elf or her prerogative with di&s;re&s;pect. But, like him al&s;o, &s;he was much better qualified to di&s;charge the duties of a private life, than to act the part of a &s;overeign. As a friend, a mother, a wife, &s;he de&s;erved every prai&s;e. Her conduct, as a daugh|ter, could &s;carcely be excu&s;ed by a virtue much &s;uperior to all the&s;e. Upon the whole, though her reign was crowded with great events, &s;he cannot, with any ju&s;tice, be called a great Prince&s;s. Subject to terror, beyond the con&s;titutional timidity of her &s;ex, &s;he was altogether inca|pable of deci&s;ive councils; and nothing, but her irre&s;i&s;|tible popularity could have &s;upported her authority, amid&s;t the ferment of tho&s;e di&s;tracted times.</P>
