<P>THE ardour of your &s;entiments, &s;ir, becomes your age, and I am plea&s;ed with your compliment, becau&s;e I perceive it is the efferve&s;ence of a &s;incere heart&mdash;I was going to &s;ay, that if&mdash;but we will proceed to our more familiar illu&s;trations!&mdash;Imagine that when the&s;e children were five weeks old, the mother of the poore&s;t, re|duced to extreme nece&s;&s;ity, puts her in|fant
<PB N="2" REF="3">in a ba&s;ket, and lays it at the door of a per&s;on equally celebrated for wealth and benevolence&mdash;the gentle|man takes it into his hou&s;e, clothes, feeds, and educates it as his own &mdash;that very infant which with the <HI>parent</HI> would be the lout I have de|&s;cribed, would with its <HI>protector</HI> be as different a creature as could exi&s;t. His pains, pa&s;&s;ions, plea&s;ures, and ideas, totally <HI>rever&s;ed</HI>&mdash;imagine like|wi&s;e that &s;ome gyp&s;ey &s;teals, or kid|naps, as it is called, the rich child from the cradle, and &s;trolls with it up and down the country: it will have its education in the open air, its lodging in a barn, and its dirty diet under a hedge. Probably it will imbibe the craft and &s;ubtlety of the gyp&s;ey, and limit its utmo&s;t
<PB N="3" REF="4">ambition to trick the traveller out of &s;ixpence, cro&s;s the palm with &s;il|ver, and tell the events which <HI>have</HI> happened (or are &s;till to be brought forward) by the <HI>line of life.</HI> Thus, in every other in&s;tance, (with a few peculiar exceptions, that have nothing to do with general rules,) <HI>habit</HI> and <HI>education</HI> form the mind, and colour the human character.&mdash;</P>
<P>But how does this influence, what we call virtue and vice? &s;aid I&mdash;Virtue and vice, (rejoin'd the gentleman,) are as dependent upon external as inter|nal circum&s;tances: they are properties not more hereditary than adventitious and artificial: nor do they i&s;&s;ue more from the heart than from habit.&mdash;You a&s;toni&s;h me, I replied.&mdash;You are now, (cried he,) at the period of human life,
<PB N="4" REF="5">when curio&s;ity is <HI>often</HI> caught in &s;ur|prizes. Experience will teach you to hear what now &s;eems &s;trange, without emotion I have &s;aid nothing but what will too &s;oon be intelligible.&mdash;</P>
<P>Pray go on, &s;ir&mdash;pray go on&mdash;</P>

<P>&mdash;There are, doubtle&s;s&mdash;re&s;umed the gentleman &mdash; &s;ome con&s;titutions &s;o adapted by nature to virtue, that no troubles, &s;ituations, or tempta|tions, can &s;ubdue, or extirpate, their a|miable propen&s;ities&mdash;but <HI>ninety-nine</HI> times out of a <HI>hundred,</HI> a character takes its bias and bearing from mere tuition, and the line it is either led or
<PB N="5" REF="6">thrown into, in the fir&s;t &s;tage of the hu|man journey. If there are <HI>no</HI> innate ideas, &s;ir, it follows that the mind of every new-born babe is equally pure &mdash;If there <HI>are</HI> tho&s;e infantine &s;eeds of the under&s;tanding and little embrios of intellect&mdash;they are ea&s;ily turned into what channel the parent thinks proper &mdash;&s;o that I cannot but think the father of a family one of the mo&s;t aweful charges upon earth:
<Q><L>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; our parent's hand</L>
<L>Writes on our hearts the fir&s;t faint characters,</L>
<L>Which time retracing deepens into &s;trength.</L></Q></P>
<P>After which,
<Q>Nothing can efface them, but death or heaven.</Q>
Yet we behold &s;aid I, many children unlike their parents, both good and
<PB N="6" REF="7">bad. It is admitted, &s;aid Mr. Greaves: yet you will, at the &s;ame time, ob&s;erve, where the notions of pa|rents and children are di&s;&s;imilar, the di&s;&s;imilitude ari&s;es rather from difference of ages, or improper cul|ture, than any thing el&s;e; in general children are not liker in features than habits, and I do a&s;&s;ure you family|<HI>minds</HI> are as often tran&s;mitted as family-<HI>faces.</HI> There is a tractabi|lity in youth which receives like &s;now, every impre&s;&s;ion&mdash;and it is almo&s;t as difficult to era&s;e the im|pre&s;&s;ion of one as the other: no|thing but heaven can effect it.&mdash;If a &s;on is trained up early to de|cency of manners, and has the example of dignity living and moving before his eyes (unle&s;s his temper is
<PB N="7" REF="8">particularly untoward) he will turn out an elegant character&mdash;If he is trained up in different principles, he will act accordingly.&mdash;The Hoyden and the Prude, among&s;t the other &s;ex, take not their tint of character one time in ten from nature, but from a neglect early to give them a proper idea of de|portment. But yet, &s;aid I, very &s;edate women have romping, runaway daugh|ters, and very prudent fathers have very perver&s;e &s;ons.&mdash;I mean, (replied Mr. Greaves,) to &s;ay no more than this, that, generally &s;peaking, men and wo|men act and think as they are taught whil&s;t they are only able to li&s;p out their meaning&mdash;that education will have &s;ome influence on the mo&s;t abandoned; and that, upon the whole, virtue and vice depend very e&s;&s;enti|ally
<PB N="8" REF="9">on our primary &s;entiments and examples; which, whether good or ill, will externally attend us in &s;ome mea&s;ure, through all po&s;&s;ible tran&s;itions from the time we leave our cradles, to the time we &s;hall be depo&s;ited in our coffins&mdash;If I have not wearied you, we will <HI>now</HI> &s;ee how far habit, influ|ences our judgments in the great and important article of <HI>reputation.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIV.</HEAD>
<P>I li&s;ten to you, &s;ir, (&s;aid I) with joy, and only lament that I am contribut|ing to your fatigue, at the time that I am receiving &s;uch a fund of enter|tainment.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="10">&mdash;Habit, my young friend, &s;aid the gentleman, operates with equal energy upon man and bea&s;t. I could ea&s;ily produce evidences of the fact, by ca&s;ting an eye upon the very hor&s;es now engaged in the dutiful drudgery of dragging us along, and upon the herds and flocks which are grazing or &s;porting be&s;ide us: but we will confine our&s;elves to our own &s;pecies, which are certainly the mo&s;t intere&s;ting objects of &s;peculation. I was about to ob&s;erve, that Cu&s;tom has much to do with our moral cha|racters. There are certain actions, &s;o naturally and palpably, good, or evil, that neither &s;ophi&s;try, nor &s;lander, nor addre&s;s, can either injure, mend, or mar them. To que&s;tion the light at noon day, or the dark in the zenith
<PB N="10" REF="11">of the night, would argue a mala|dy beyond madne&s;s: &s;o in like man|ner to di&s;pute, whether downright wickedne&s;s <HI>is</HI> wickedne&s;s, and evident excellence <HI>is</HI> excellence, would be a lunacy in ethics, &s;o ab&s;urd, that the poetical frenzy of poor Lee would be cool argument to it&mdash;on the other hand, my good &s;ir, if you live and mix long with mankind, you will find many of your fellow-creatures, pining away exi&s;tence under the la&s;hes,&mdash; the bleeding la&s;hes of reproach, merely becau&s;e it is the <HI>cu&s;tom</HI> to call one thing right and another wrong, without trac|ing either to the bottom. It is a maxim that the Vox Populi, is the Vox Dei &mdash;that (as you know it is tran&s;lated) "what every body &s;ays mu&s;t be true." I know nothing &s;o de&s;erving refuta|tion
<PB N="11" REF="12">as a collection of tho&s;e old &s;aws and proverbs, which, acquiring force from antiquity, and e&s;timation from ru&s;t&mdash;for there are virtuo&s;os in let|ters, as well as in coins&mdash;are at length con&s;idered as utterly inconte&s;tible. Now, certain I am, that upon an examination into tho&s;e very maxims we put &s;o much credit in, &s;ome will turn out futile, &s;ome di&s;putable, and many unfaithful&mdash;for minute &s;crutinies we have not time: it will be &s;ufficient to look into <HI>that</HI> I have ju&s;t mentioned, and there is none more implicitly believed. "What every body &s;ays mu&s;t be true"&mdash;I have my&s;elf &s;een many in&s;tances to di&s;prove this; but I &s;hall beg your acceptance of one which is now uppermo&s;t in my me|mory.&mdash;A young gentleman of my
<PB N="12" REF="13">particular acquaintance, has for &s;ome time been de&s;erted by his old compa|nions, and branded as a man of un|&s;teady principles, who&s;e heart I know to abound with all tho&s;e &s;en&s;ibilities which have hurried him as it were into the vortex of liberality, till he is be|come an object of liberality him&s;elf. He has tho&s;e glowing feelings, and &s;en|timents, which do at once honour and &s;ervice, to human-nature: notwith|&s;tanding which, like poor Mr. Blewitt (who&s;e hi&s;tory was recited by the gro|cer) embarra&s;&s;ments have be&s;et him, and the world &s;ets him down an <HI>undone</HI> man. The world gets hold of a pre|judice and then it is called Vox Dei. The Vox Populi, is given as the &s;en|timent of <HI>every-body,</HI> and thus many reputations are mi&s;taken and mi&s;re|pre&s;ented, which de&s;erve a better fate.
<PB N="13" REF="14">There are various per&s;ons likewi&s;e now particularly reprobated for a few indelicate conce&s;&s;ions, to which nece&s;&s;ity may, in violence of their bet|ter judgments, have con&s;trained them to yield, who (had they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed hap|pier circum&s;tances) would have made a much more re&s;pectable figure than tho&s;e which now mark them with in&s;a|my. Many an unfortunate female too, at this time wandering up and down the &s;treets&mdash;many an in&s;ulted and de|&s;erving character&mdash;But I am rambling too mi&s;cellaneou&s;ly&mdash;I feel my&s;elf a little weary&mdash;Heigho&mdash;</P>
<P>Here the gentleman &s;toped abruptly &mdash;His countenance became &s;uddenly clouded&mdash;his lip quivered&mdash;his eye remained fixed; and cla&s;ping his hands forcibly together, he at length bur&s;t
<PB N="14" REF="15">into tears&mdash;After he a little recovered him&s;elf&mdash;he caught me hold by the arm, and exclaimed&mdash;Oh! &s;ir&mdash;my daughter! my daughter!&mdash;my Alme|ria!</P>

<P>I am now compo&s;ed, my young friend &mdash;the idea of a dome&s;tic misfortune obtruded it&s;elf upon me, and I could not help feeling the &s;troke of huma|nity&mdash;of nature, and a father&mdash;Heaven! cried I,&mdash;you di&s;tract me. I was about to take notice, replied Mr. Greaves&mdash;of <HI>one</HI> cruelty in the Vox Populi, which is certainly again&s;t every notion of the Vox Dei. 'Tis the cu&s;tom, &s;ir, to abandon the weake&s;t part of our &s;pecies, for <HI>that</HI> ruin which
<PB N="15" REF="16">the artifices of our &s;ex have perpe|trated; nor can any future repentence remove the &s;en&s;e of their error, or re|&s;tore them to the bo&s;oms of more for|tunate women:
<Q>They &s;et like &s;tars to ri&s;e no more.&mdash;</Q>
I had a wife, &s;ir, with whom I have mourned many years,&mdash;though I bu|ried her but &s;ix weeks ago&mdash;She died of a broken heart, and there was, I a&s;&s;ure you,&mdash;a woe in the family big enough to break it.&mdash;About eleven years ago, &s;ir, an only child was taken from me&mdash;I was robbed of her by a man whom I held the neare&s;t to my heart&mdash;and for five years it has been my ince&s;&s;ant bu&s;ine&s;s to recover my darling, but in vain. My wife fell into a deep and rapid con&s;umption,
<PB N="16" REF="17">and I was obliged to re&s;ide with her in the country&mdash;She grew wor&s;e and weaker every hour&mdash;but two days be|fore &s;he re&s;igned her la&s;t breath&mdash;we received (by a &s;pecial me&s;&s;enger) a packet&mdash;how &s;hall I &s;peak it&mdash;from&mdash; from my beloved&mdash;mi&s;guided&mdash;re|penting wanderer!&mdash;The poor thing had (the better to per&s;uade) thrown the pathetic parts of her &s;tory into poetry. &mdash;But that which delighted me more&mdash; far more&mdash;than all the re&s;t&mdash;and which would have more magic for a parent's heart, than the poetry of a Milton&mdash; was an atte&s;ted account from a man of reputation, that my child was actually at la&s;t under the protection of that noble in&s;titution which offers an a&s;ylum to in&s;ulted penitence.&mdash;In the fir&s;t tran&s;port, I could not conceal the
<PB N="17" REF="18">news from my wife, but &s;he had only power to pre&s;s the paper, trembling to her bo&s;om, and feebly lifted up her eyes to heaven&mdash;the re&s;t&mdash;you mu&s;t &s;pare me, &s;ir, upon the tender &s;ubject &mdash;&s;he is dead!&mdash;&s;he is in heaven!&mdash;</P>
<P>The poor gentleman covered his face in his hankerchief, and I have no words to de&s;cribe my own feelings&mdash;</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="36" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVI.</HEAD>
<P>&mdash;When Mr. Greaves could again lift up his head&mdash;he told me, that having tru&s;ted to the ground the remains of his wife, he was now going to vi&s;it his long-lo&s;t daughter, who was in &mdash;he &s;topt&mdash;and I was unwilling to enlarge upon the &s;ubject, though I
<PB N="18" REF="19">de&s;ired mo&s;t ardently to &s;ee the poetry he &s;poke of&mdash;But for the pre&s;ent we dropt the matter, and a profound &s;i|lence en&s;ued till we again changed hor&s;es. At la&s;t, however, Mr. Greaves perceiving my anxiety, and gue&s;&s;ing the cau&s;e, put his hand into his pocket, and produced a &s;mall bundle of papers, fa&s;tened by a piece of red tape&mdash;from the&s;e he took a manu&s;cript, of which he thus declared his inten|tions, as he held it in his hand.</P>
<P>Here it is&mdash;here is that unhappy girl&mdash;my poor Almeria's petition&mdash; read it, young gentleman&mdash;read it, and pity the daughter&mdash;and the father. &mdash;If it &s;hould particularly &s;trike you, take a copy, and if you continue long in London, perhaps you may &s;ee it in print&mdash;If you &s;hould not, and you
<PB N="19" REF="20">&s;hould chance to &s;urvive me, (as it is mo&s;t probable you will)&mdash;publi&s;h it&mdash; and at the &s;ame time, publi&s;h with it this <HI>Letter of Gratitude</HI>&mdash;there are rea|&s;ons why&mdash;I would not chu&s;e (being but too much intere&s;ted in the con|tents) to appear in the bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;take it therefore, and give it to the world at your be&s;t lei&s;ure&mdash;There, &s;ir,&mdash;it were improper to &s;uppre&s;s it&mdash;perhaps it may fall into the hands of the young and di&s;&s;ipated&mdash;perhaps it may find its way into the clo&s;ets of the cha&s;te and beautiful&mdash;The libertine may &s;natch it up in the intervals of his gay career; and the parent, afflicted by the lo&s;s of <HI>his</HI> child, may be in|duced to read it from affection and curio&s;ity&mdash;In all, or in any of the&s;e ca&s;es, it will afford &s;ome &s;alutary re|flections,
<PB N="20" REF="21">and the heart, the con&s;cience, and the under&s;tanding will point them out immediately&mdash;He put the paper into my hand&mdash;I reminded him of the plea&s;ing pro&s;pect of &s;eeing his re&s;tored daughter&mdash;He did not &s;eem in&s;en&s;ible of my wi&s;hes to di&s;&s;ipate his melancholy, but &s;aid nothing&mdash;As I knew it mu&s;t be &s;ome time before he could collect him&s;elf, and perceiving he began to clo&s;e his eyes, as if he de|&s;ired &s;ilence, I left him to his reflec|ions (which it would have been im|pertinent to interrupt after the hint he had given me) and began to open my papers, which melted me &s;o many times into tears during the peru&s;al, that I was heartily glad the poor gen|tleman <HI>affected</HI> &s;lumber.&mdash;As I have now had the performance &s;o long by
<PB N="21" REF="22">me I &s;hall &s;et it down in my journal in this place, where (though it &s;ome|what interferes with my further con|nection with Mr. Greaves) it properly belongs, becau&s;e I would not disjoint the &s;ubject from the &s;entiments which introduced it to my knowledge&mdash;So that if ever my hi&s;tory is found, the hi&s;tory of this unhappy lady will be found with it; and in &s;o publi&s;hing an age, they can fall into few hands, which will not &s;end them to the pre&s;s.</P>

<P>Before I proceed to &s;et down other matters which fell out to chequer the adventures of my journey, I cannot but ob&s;erve that about two years af|ter this period I met Mr. Greaves in the Park, with a beautiful young crea|ture under his arm; and &s;ome time afterwards I paid him a vi&s;it, when he took me cordially by the hand, and &s;poke to me as follows.</P>
<P>My dear BENIGNUS, where have you been buried &s;ince our la&s;t inter|view? When I told you upon the road the occa&s;ion of that melancholy you detected through my efforts to conceal it, you may remember I told you the motive of my journey. Upon my ar|rival
<PB N="48" REF="49">in London, and taking leave of you, I call'd an hackney coach, and drove directly to ***&mdash;In one word&mdash; I found my <HI>daughter.</HI>&mdash;I felt the faint|ing penitent in my arms. I received of her with an anxiety of joy&mdash;a tremor tran&s;port&mdash;Oh! BENIGNUS, think for me&mdash;colour the &s;cene in the paint of youthful ardour&mdash;do ju&s;tice to nature, and <HI>imagine</HI> the delicacies which were never <HI>&s;poken.</HI> You have &s;een my daughter&mdash;I never walk without her &mdash;and yet, &s;ir, all this joy is da&s;hed with an ingredient of &s;orrow. The prudes (untouched by the pathos of her penitence) carry an air of ceremonious civility towards my child.&mdash;The faded virgins who have never pa&s;&s;ed the fiery trial of temptation, and a &s;et of haughty matrons, who have every
<PB N="49" REF="50">other vice that di&s;graces the &s;ex, but that of which even nature <HI>predeter|mined</HI> they &s;hould never be guilty&mdash; treat my Almeria with a coy and in|&s;ulting re&s;erve, which goes too near her heart&mdash;an heart, BENIGNUS, ge|nerous and gentle as&mdash;</P>
<P>Here our di&s;cour&s;e was interrupted by ALMERIA her&s;elf, who came to in|form us the chocolate waited for us in the little &s;aloon.
<Q><L>&mdash;Grace was in all her &s;teps,</L>
<L>In every action, dignity and love.</L></Q>
Her own epi&s;tle has &s;o pathetically de|&s;cribed the mi&s;ery of her &s;ituation, that &s;he has not left room for any thing but pity.&mdash;And yet who that con&s;iders &s;uch a creature has been, as it were, <HI>public property</HI>&mdash;that reflects,
<PB N="50" REF="51">how many are at this very moment chained down to a nece&s;&s;ity equally &s;ore; many of them expo&s;ed to the want of that daily bread, which even nightly impurity cannot &s;upply&mdash; &s;ome of them beating through the &s;treets by the barbarity of their be|trayer&mdash;&s;ome hunted from one hid|ing place to another, by the vigilance of the bailiff; and all of them liable to contempt, indignity, and di&s;|temper&mdash;who, I &s;ay, that collects to|gether the&s;e facts in his mind, can be content with expre&s;&s;ing barren com|pa&s;&s;ion?&mdash;Who can forbear mixing relief with their tears, and ble&s;&s;ing the benevolence which fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted, and &s;till continues, their <HI>A&s;ylum.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>I have a little violated chronology, by placing the&s;e tran&s;actions &s;ome|what
<PB N="51" REF="52">out of the order of time, but as my hi&s;tory is written at a venture, and may never vi&s;it the world, I have been le&s;s cautious of ob&s;erving critical rules. However, as I by no means de|&s;ign to make a book of digre&s;&s;ions, I &s;hall now turn back to Mr. Greaves, who having &s;at with his eyes clo&s;ed, was, when he opened them again, much more fitted for &s;ociety. There are, in truth, certain moments when the mu&s;ic of the <HI>&s;pheres</HI> would be di&s;|cordant, and when the condolence of our deare&s;t acquaintances is an unwel|come interruption. The human &s;oul &s;ettles on her darling &s;ubject, de&s;cends into her&s;elf, and indulges in a luxury, which, bee like, extracts honey from the poi&s;on of calamity. In one of the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions was Mr. Greaves,
<PB N="52" REF="53">when he counterfeited repo&s;e: he had now reconciled him&s;elf to the events he had contemplated, (for he was both a philo&s;opher and a chri&s;tian) and with an affability peculiar to well-bred people, begged my pardon for his reveries.</P>

<P>We were now ju&s;t &s;tepping into our la&s;t &s;tage but one, and though the glories of the &s;un were over, his de|parting beams were extremely agree|able. Mr. Greaves re&s;umed a look of complacency, and I being willing to keep as clear of the only &s;ubject that could perhaps again di&s;compo&s;e it, a&s;k|ed what &s;ort of &s;en&s;ations were created
<PB N="53" REF="54">in his mind by the &s;tory of Mr. Blewitt. Though his hi&s;tory was related (an|&s;wered my companion) in unpoli&s;hed language, it contains a folio of va|luable facts. But what a pity it is, repeated I, that &s;uch mercenary hearts as are lodged in the bo&s;oms of the Quaker and Grocer, &s;hould be, in ge|neral, more undi&s;turbed through life, than &s;uch as guided the feelings of the generous Mr. Blewitt. Alas! re|turned the gentleman, you are yet an infant in terre&s;tial events. I dare &s;wear you have an excellent heart, and I am &s;ure a good under&s;tanding, yet you know but little of life.&mdash;You profe&s;s to be travelling in pur&s;uit of <HI>happine&s;s,</HI> and to dedicate your for|tune to the &s;ervice of &s;ociety. From hence I &s;hould conclude that you are
<PB N="54" REF="55">flying from <HI>mi&s;ery.</HI> I related my ad|ventures at the village. He &s;aid if I could not find Contentment in the &s;hade, it was doubtful whether I &s;hould meet her in the city. But I fear, continued he, you expect from the world more than it can be&s;tow; you have, perhaps, placed the &s;tandard of felicity too high, or your ideas of it are probably a little romantic.</P>
<P>All I want upon earth, replied I, is comprized in three things, friend&s;hip, fidelity, and gratitude.&mdash;At your age, re&s;umed Mr. Greaves, (&s;miling,) I entered the world, animated by the &s;ame hopes, and fa&s;cinated by the &s;ame notions. My head&mdash;my hands, and my heart, were bu&s;y to derive a reflect|ed ble&s;&s;ing to <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> by having pro|moted the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of <HI>others.</HI> To
<PB N="55" REF="56">this end I continued in the world till that agonizing accident I have already related.&mdash;</P>
<P>At this cri&s;is our chai&s;e having ju&s;t a&s;cended a hill arrived at a very beau|tiful &s;pot indeed. It was an eminence that topt an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect, and commanded the &s;cene below, which was compo&s;ed of <HI>intermingled</HI> towers, and &s;pires, woods and waters, the verdure of fields, and the variegation of vallies&mdash;I could not help ejaculat|ing with &s;ome energy&mdash;Is it not &s;trange that a world like this, &s;o fitted for the reception and happine&s;s of every being which inhabits it, with &s;uch noble capacities of plea&s;ure adapt|ed to each, &s;hould neverthele&s;s be the &s;eat of general torment and fretfulne&s;s, di&s;a&s;ter and di&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;Is it not &s;trange that&mdash;that&mdash;</P>

The motive of commerce is no longer rational; and bu&s;ine&s;s, which was originally de&s;igned to promote health, and circulate interchanged con|veniencies, is now for the mo&s;t part ava|riciou&s;ly carried on, to &s;well the coffers of the individual by impoveri&s;hing the &s;pecies; nay, the mercenary &s;pirit of the times extends to nations and climates divided by the remote&s;t part of the

But if you plea&s;e we will trace this evil <HI>ab origine.</HI> The Almighty cre|ated a world, then peopled it, and after|wards found that it was <HI>good.</HI> The management of it was put into the hands of man&mdash;not, however, to be too minute, let us take notice, that every thing was once indi&s;criminately enjoy|ed. The earth was a common pro|perty, and it was fertile without labour&mdash;the error of our fir&s;t parents con&s;iderably changed the &s;y&s;tem, and tillage and druggery became nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ubdue a &s;oil, that no longer pro|duced plenty &s;pontaneou&s;ly. No ab&s;olute right however or proprietor|&s;hip was yet a&s;certained, and every one fixed on, and cultivated the &s;pot he cho&s;e: this <HI>mi&s;cellaneous</HI> participa|tion &s;oon created di&s;order; for, as
<PB N="59" REF="60">the bad pa&s;&s;ions were now let loo&s;e upon the world, indolence &s;eized upon the comforts which had been acquired by indu&s;try; and hence &s;prang dome&s;tic conte&s;t and civil di&s;|pute, and half mankind were at war. Tho&s;e that obtained the victory held the conquered as his &s;lave; and from hence originated tho&s;e di&s;tinctions, which, obtained by rapacity, and kept by force, were after &s;anctified by poli|tical in&s;titutions: for upon this (find|ing men were to be re&s;trained from violence and inva&s;ion only by com|pul&s;ion, terror, and authority,) the laws came in to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>&s;tronger</HI> party: the difference betwixt meum and tuum was &s;oon under&s;tood, and every individual maintained him|&s;elf upon that which was now &s;ecured
<PB N="60" REF="61">to him by certain compacts, to vio|late which was henceforth to be con|&s;idered as a puni&s;hable crime. By this time an idea of property became &s;acred and general, and by the&s;e means the civilized part of the earth was &s;aid to belong, not as formerly, to all alike, but to a third part of its inhabitants. Subordination therefore of nece&s;&s;ity took place.

<PB N="62" REF="63">man has given up the point, and makes the mo&s;t of his &s;ituation: the clown ri&s;es early to the ta&s;k of culti|vation, and the ma&s;ter looks indolently on, and receives the profit.

<P>You have di&s;covered to me Mr. Greaves, &s;aid I, a train of ob&s;ervations of which I had no idea&mdash;but you are preparing to &s;peak&mdash;and I would not interrupt you for the univer&s;e&mdash;</P>
<P>The ob&s;ervations I have made, (con|tinued Mr. Greaves,) have been no doubt made, (and much more &s;agaci|ou&s;ly,) by many others, for contem|plation, philo&s;ophy, and &s;cience, have now gone very far; our di&s;coveries in letters and in lands, may perhaps have been pretty equal. There may be yet unknown tracks in &s;peculation; the in|tellect may &s;till abound with new re|&s;erves of wi&s;dom. There is &s;till, it is

After what has been &s;aid, &s;hould you not be &s;ur|pri&s;ed to find a great deal of happi|ne&s;s: and yet, di&s;tributed up and down the various parts of it, there really is a very con&s;iderable &s;hare. That the infelicity grows out of all proportion &s;till <HI>more</HI> con&s;iderable cannot ea&s;ily be determined&mdash;for
<PB N="67" REF="68">though the fate of thou&s;ands can only be made &s;upportable, by the chearful expectation of a <HI>better,</HI> and though the human heart is in general blinded by temporal prejudices, yet coar&s;e as the ma&s;s of gratifications are that <HI>endear</HI> life to the multitude, they are neverthele&s;s gratifications, and re|ceive attachment from cu&s;tom. The joys of more delicate minds are indeed le&s;s extended, and lie in a &s;mall com|pa&s;s, being confined to the little circle of the few, who&s;e feelings are &s;oftened by nature, and refined by art. But were the agonies of exi&s;tence, &s;till greater and acuter than they <HI>are,</HI> the DEITY is not the author of it&mdash;he made the world&mdash;&s;urvey it, &s;ir, (even through the &s;hadings of the evening) and tell me, if it is not worthy of a divine

Has he not given us early ideas of more di&s;inter|e&s;ted attachments, and in&s;pired us with di&s;po&s;itions, to philanthropy and friend&s;hip! has he not &s;eated in the bo&s;om a monitor, to compliment

<P>&mdash;This, my young friend, is a &s;aint &s;ketch of the works and intentions of the Deity&mdash;that tho&s;e works and in|tentions are abu&s;ed, can never be imputed to their all-kind Author, but to <HI>man.</HI></P>
<P>If the beauties and benefits of na|ture are perverted; if the faculties of the mind and body are ob&s;tinately bent to actions evidently contradic|tory to the purpo&s;es for which they were given; if love and friend&s;hip are overborne by their oppo&s;ite pa&s;|&s;ions; and, if&mdash;as has been before hinted, <HI>intere&s;t</HI> carries away the palm from earth and heaven&mdash;who but man
<PB N="71" REF="72">is chargeable with the con&s;equences of this general inver&s;ion of ble&s;&s;|ings?&mdash;</P>
<P>The fact is indi&s;putable, &s;ir, &s;aid I&mdash; I tremble, and I adore; but as Mr. Blewitt &s;eemed always to perform the purpo&s;es for which he was born a man, how is it, that he, and others like him, &s;hould not pa&s;s &s;moothly through the &s;ea of life.

<P>Mr. Blewitt did not reflect that &mdash;as money is the property by
<PB N="73" REF="74">which every pa&s;&s;ion is gratified, man will naturally idolize it as the golden calf; and that, to adopt a few &s;aving maxims, in relation to keeping a part of &s;uch property always at command, would be favourable even to his <HI>gene|ro&s;ity;</HI> becau&s;e it mu&s;t needs be a deep misfortune to find the hand, ac|cu&s;tomed to liberallity, compelled to contract, when it can give no more. &mdash;In a country where <HI>appearances</HI> of wealth, can claim veneration, where money acquires the chymic quality of turning every thing it approximates into gold, and where that gold is moreover able to array in&s;amy in the robe of integrity, and lead the judgments of the wi&s;e&s;t blind-fold as it plea&s;es&mdash;In &s;uch a country, every <HI>apparent want</HI> of this property,
<PB N="74" REF="75">will be liable to neglect and ill treat|ment&mdash;and every degree of indigence will meet de&s;ertion, for this plain rea|&s;on, becau&s;e indigence has nothing either to procure or excite the idea of authority, nor to ob&s;erve tho&s;e rules which externally di&s;tingui&s;h the ma&s;ter from the &s;ervant. You will &s;ay perhaps, all this &s;ort of di&s;tinction is ridiculous. No doubt of it; but as more than fifty, out of &s;ixty have adopted &s;uch di&s;tinctions,&mdash;as they are actually the general &s;tandards of con|duct,&mdash;as they are al&s;o <HI>more</HI> than two thou&s;and years old&mdash;it is in vain to di&s;pute their propriety&mdash;one might as well di&s;pute the cu&s;toms of a country &mdash;tell the Indian, it is indecent to go naked, or that a Toledo dangling by the &s;ide of the Spani&s;h pea&s;ant, mu&s;t
<PB N="75" REF="76">be extremely inconvenient.

<P>&mdash;It was now night, and we were in the middle of Finchley Common&mdash; The driver bid us &s;ecure part of our money, if we had any great quantity about us, for that he &s;aw a fellow lurking by the &s;ide of the road, at a little di&s;tance.&mdash;In five &s;econds we were up with the man, who was groan|ing piteou&s;ly upon a gra&s;&s;y hillock. Mr. Greaves, (who knew the arts of his own &s;pecies) &s;u&s;pected this to be an impo&s;ition, and oppo&s;ed my de&s;ire to have him lifted into the chai&s;e&mdash; But the&s;e ideas were pre&s;ently re|moved, for the &s;tranger got up, and coming to the window, pre&s;ented

<P>Half an hour ago, gentlemen&mdash;&s;aid the man&mdash;a hor&s;eman came by me, and I was tempted, (to &s;upply the wants of a large family) to demand his money&mdash;He put into my hand this pur&s;e.&mdash;I conjure you, gentlemen, if by any &s;troke of happy chance he &s;hould be any part of your company&mdash; take it, and return it to him ju&s;t as I received it&mdash;It is my fir&s;t violation of the laws, either of ho&s;pitality or my country&mdash;I might po&s;&s;ibly return home undi&s;covered, but I <HI>feel</HI> that I cannot bear it.

<P>There was &s;omething &s;o very un|u&s;ual in this new mode of attacking, that it was &s;ome time before Mr. Greaves could &s;peak.&mdash;For my own part I was in a &s;tate of mind betwixt trembling and crying.&mdash;At length Mr. Greaves, who could no longer doubt of the offender's &s;incerity, invited him
<PB N="79" REF="80">to accompany us in the chai&s;e, if he was going to town, pledging him|&s;elf at the &s;ame time, as a man of honour, not to betray him.&mdash;The poor man after the deliberation of a minute &mdash;&s;ighed and a&s;cended&mdash;though the po&s;tilion muttered that we might be tran&s;ported for harbouring robbers, and might repent it before we got over the common yet.&mdash;</P>
<P>Our conver&s;ation on the way was &s;uch as might have touched the hard|e&s;t heart.&mdash;As &s;oon as we were upon the pavement, the gentleman got out, but not before we had obtained the &s;ecret of his addre&s;s&mdash;The driver &s;eeing him e&s;cape&mdash;&s;aid&mdash;he had a great mind to cry &s;top thief, for that he was &s;ure 'twas hanging matter&mdash; and he was not certain whether
<PB N="80" REF="81"><HI>he</HI> &s;hould not come to the gallows for it him&s;elf, &s;eeing as how he was aiding and <HI>abutting.</HI> In this conjecture he was perfectly prophetic, for upon my travelling the &s;ame road in my way to the village, about &s;ix months after, I under&s;tood that this very identical nice|minded driver, had actually mounted, &s;ome little time before, for being de|tected in confederating with a gang of highwaymen, to whom he gave intel|ligence, what company had made ap|pointments to pa&s;s by his ma&s;ter's hou&s;e, in their return to town.&mdash;The poor man in&s;i&s;ted upon leaving the pur&s;e, but we did our be&s;t to alleviate his mi&s;erable condition, by an equal pre&s;ent of five guineas&mdash;I was going to give ten, but Mr. Greaves geatly pluckt me by the button, ob&s;erving

<P>This hi&s;tory, madam, together with other adventures in the world (with which at &s;ome future period, that world may be made acquainted) &mdash;have led me to a &s;eclu&s;ion almo&s;t as retired from the bu&s;tle and intrigue of life, as the unhappy author of the Legend. I intend my memoirs &s;hall &s;erve as the counterpart of his; and both will indi&s;putedly prove and vali|date, the peculiar truth of the&s;e &s;ingu|lar &s;entiments.</P>
<P>That, nine times out of ten, a life of benevolence is a life of in&s;ult and pain.</P>
<P>That an unwearied attention to the plea&s;ure and comfort of others, is
<PB N="101" REF="102">generally repaid by ingratitude from the world.</P>
<P>And that (in a <HI>terre&s;trial</HI> &s;en&s;e)&mdash; tracing the fact through all cla&s;&s;es of life, from the nobleman in his villa to the beggar in his &s;hed&mdash;goodne&s;s is not often, in this world, rewarded by &s;uch returns from <HI>our fellow crea|tures,</HI> as con&s;titute tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations, which are included in our ideas of happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult of the whole, madam, will be,</P>
<P N="1"><LABEL>Fir&s;t,</LABEL> <HI>To be good,</HI> would, to all intents and purpo&s;es, be to be happy, had not man degenerated in the extreme; and had not his worldly intere&s;t prevailed over the pro&s;pects and promi&s;es of futurity.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="102" REF="103"><LABEL>Secondly.</LABEL> That the world is permitted to exi&s;t, for the &s;ame rea&s;ons it was &s;pared in years which are far behind, when the Omnipotent declared with his own facred voice that&mdash;if ten, or even five, ju&s;t people could be found, the city (over which the almighty arm of vengeance, was rai&s;ed in &s;u&s;pen&s;ion) &s;hould be &s;pared.</P>
<P N="3"><LABEL>Thirdly.</LABEL> That, the perver&s;ion of money, and the abu&s;e of riches, has contributed more to the corruption of human na|ture, over every part of the habitable globe, than any other thing, &s;ince the invention of a commerce with it.</P>
<P N="4"><LABEL>Fourthly.</LABEL> That, this world (and more particu|larly the poli&s;hed and voluptuous parts
<PB N="103" REF="104">of it) would be intolerable, to a truly good mind, and, of all po&s;&s;ible places of torment, the mo&s;t &s;evere, (to men engaged in &s;ociety, but unengaged in its general aims) were it not for two rea&s;ons, which will not only be fully given in the promi&s;ed hi&s;tories &mdash;but may be briefly &s;een in the con|clu&s;ive parts of the&s;e volumes.</P>

<PB N="104" REF="105">of robbing an orchard.

Benignus was likewi&s;e frequently in&s;ulted for this be|nevolence&mdash;now I avoided in&s;ult, by the only way to e&s;cape it, either in a &s;chool or in the world&mdash;for I was one of their own &s;ort,&mdash;did as they did, and was as thoughtle&s;s, and as trickful as the be&s;t, or rather&mdash;the wor&s;t of them&mdash;the evils of life, did not &s;eize me &s;o &s;oon, as they &s;eized Benignus&mdash; When your lady&s;hip, at a future day, &s;hall read my memoirs, you will per|ceive too many rea&s;ons for an altera|tion in &s;entiment.</P>

<HEAD>PASSAGES of a TRUE STORY.</HEAD>
<P>&mdash;Oh Romeo,&mdash;Romeo, what a creature wert thou!&mdash;how courteous &mdash;how &s;agacious&mdash;how well temper|ed!&mdash;</P>
<P>He was de&s;cended, madam, from a glorious line &mdash; the &s;on of a noble &s;tock&mdash;venerable from his pedigree &mdash;royal in his extraction, and, to crown his character, he was the favou|rite companion of a dear friend of mine who is now&mdash;no more.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="117">In one of the &s;harpe&s;t days, and yet one of the faire&s;t that winter could produce, the youthful Flavian pre|pared, with his gun and his Romeo, to take the diver&s;ions of the field&mdash;hap|pie&s;t of men&mdash;happie&s;t of dogs&mdash;They were particularly lucky, and it was a day of eminent &s;ucce&s;s&mdash;this pointed the game&mdash;that brought it to the ground &mdash;the net was &s;oon crouded with the &s;poil,&mdash;but as Flavian was return|ing&mdash;</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the elevation of your rank, your lady&s;hip mu&s;t have had frequent occa&s;ion to deplore the capri|cious uncertainty of &s;ublunary enjoy|ments&mdash;mu&s;t have &s;een the eye that in the pre&s;ent moment &s;parkled with hope, in the next rolling with de&s;pair &mdash;and tears u&s;urp the features which
<PB N="117" REF="118">an hour before were dimpled by joy &mdash;this is indeed &s;o hackneyed and univer&s;al a fact, that I &s;hould beg your pardon for digre&s;&s;ing into a parenthe|&s;is about it.</P>
<P>As Flavian was returning to his hou&s;e, and Romeo was ranging the &s;kirts of acop&s;e, rather in the way of wantonne&s;s than indu&s;try&mdash;knowing perhaps, that the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day was already done&mdash;ju&s;t as the winding of the thicket meander'd into an elbow that jutted into the field,&mdash;Romeo broke &s;hort his &s;tep, and &s;tood fixed in an attitude, which put Flavian on his guard. In the next in&s;tant an hare &s;tarted from the bu&s;hes, and ran tremb|ling to the oppo&s;ite hedge-row; on the other &s;ide of which, was a &s;haded lane, that led to Flavian's villa.&mdash;
<PB N="118" REF="119">There is an enthu&s;ia&s;m, which &s;eizes the &s;portman at the &s;ight of &s;udden game.

<P>&mdash;Mighty God,&mdash;I want forti|tude to go on!&mdash;</P>
<P>Flavian, madam, had&mdash;a wife&mdash;un|happily for him, &s;he was tempted by the brightne&s;s of the morning, and the report of his fowling piece at no great di&s;tance, to &s;trole from her hou&s;e, and &mdash;as was &s;ometimes her tender cu&s;|tom&mdash;intended to ha&s;ten his return, not only to enjoy his &s;ociety, but to put an end to the depredations of the day.&mdash;The &s;ound of the gun had
<PB N="119" REF="120">&s;carcely died upon the air, when a &s;ound of a different kind &s;aluted the ear: Flavian da&s;hed through the hedge, and &s;aw his Maria extended along the path-way, which was over-hung by the bu&s;hes, and her bo&s;om was bathed in that blood, which &s;he now found had been &s;hed by her hu&s;band. In pur&s;u|ing the game, Romeo fir&s;t di&s;covered his mi&s;tre&s;s, and with his four-feet upon her lap, was mourning over her wounds: the agony was &s;o legible in his countenance, that if he had the power of &s;peech&mdash;it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe it.</P>
<P>The hu&s;band&mdash;ah, madam! In the&s;e ca&s;es, as I have ju&s;t remarked &mdash;the brute and the man are alike; &s;ince both mu&s;t deliver over to the dumb &s;en&s;ations of the heart, a lan|guage

In &s;hort, madam, the human &s;oul
<PB N="135" REF="136">ebbs and flows like the ocean, though not with the &s;ame regularity. There is no purity, nor any devotion, but &s;ometimes wavers for a <HI>moment:</HI> believe me, there are periods when the mo&s;t apo&s;tolic faith &s;taggers&mdash; aye, and that upon principle; for the better the mind, the greater is its oc|ca&s;ional agitation. Divines tells us, it is &s;inful. I in&s;i&s;t, it is unavoidable, and I will in this ca&s;e be &s;o bold to enter a caveat again&s;t all the ca&s;&s;ocks in the kingdom. There is an intricacy in the events of the world which will on the fir&s;t view con&s;tantly appear my&s;terious. They frequently put the human intellect upon the puzzle. We want not books, or arguments, to teach us ambiguities; for every <HI>ra|tional &s;en&s;e</HI> about us pre&s;&s;es the <HI>whys</HI>
<PB N="136" REF="137">and <HI>wherefores</HI> &s;pontaneou&s;ly and irre&s;i&s;tibly upon us. 'Tis not, madam, the vanity of penetration: 'tis mere|ly the curio&s;ity and inquiring propen|&s;ity of nature.</P>
<P>It was, with a propriety peculiar to the cla&s;&s;ic genius of Mr. Addi&s;on, that he called the&s;e labyrinths of pro|vidence, that &s;o frequently cro&s;s the lines of life&mdash;"a regular con&s;u|&s;ion." Let us examine that cele|brated expre&s;&s;ion, and it may per|haps lead us into a train of thought, which may throw new light on our pre&s;ent &s;ubjects, both with relation to man and brute. The eye of God, (and po&s;&s;ibly the eyes of his angels) may &s;ee the regularity, unintangled in the confu&s;ion. But what proves this more, than that finite can by
<PB N="137" REF="138">no means, mea&s;ure with infinite? To man's imperfect vi&s;ion, many events already hinted at in this letter, and many more which might be brought into the catalogue of in&s;tances, are not only repugnant to every moral, natural, or con&s;cientious law (were we to decide of them by the narrow line of human ju&s;tice) but are utterly oppo&s;ite to our own ideas of common compa&s;&s;ion. Still farther. I beg leave to advance the matter <HI>much</HI> farther. It is a fact, (atte&s;ted by the tears and agonies of a mournful mul|titude) that the horrid variety of mi&s;eries which attack the attention on all &s;ides, would tempt the &s;obere&s;t head, and the devoute&s;t heart, in the world, to &s;u&s;pect that the affairs of that world were totally eclip&s;ed in confu|&s;ion,

<P>To prove this, there ari&s;e at once &s;o many in&s;tances, that choice is per|plext in variety. Let us quit the fire-&s;ide, madam, for half an hour, and, turning our eyes on the active world, walk lei&s;urely along to &s;urvey the great &s;cenes that are &s;lecting be|fore us.

<PB N="166" REF="167">The utmo&s;t that I can venture more, is to pre&s;ent your lady&s;hip with a few inferences drawn from the whole of our ramble among&s;t the fields of unu&s;ual &s;peculation.</P>
<P>As the innocent man, madam, has often lo&s;t his life, and di&s;graced his relations on &s;u&s;picion of guilt&mdash;as the hardne&s;s of a creditor frequently tightens the cord of the law, till it pinches the bowels of a numerous fa|mily &mdash; as there are actually parents in the world which not only de&s;ert their offspring, but &s;ear up that &s;trong attachment which is generally the vi|tal principle of nature&mdash;as mode&s;ty, ingenuity, and hone&s;ty, are often har|ra&s;&s;ed by innumerable cares and per|plexities; to &s;oothe which even the compliments of the con&s;cience are not
<PB N="167" REF="168">always adequate&mdash;and as&mdash;on the other hand,&mdash;tho&s;e to whom fortune hath been fuller-handed, frequently di&s;turb the good order of &s;ociety, and u&s;e their adventitious acqui&s;itions to pro|mote oppre&s;&s;ion and to extend luxury. &mdash;As tho&s;e who addre&s;s the Deity in fervor of heart, are often de&s;titute of a comfortable proportion of food&mdash; wander naked and forlorn through life &mdash;and others that have food, want appetite to eat it&mdash;while tho&s;e who never mention the Deity, but to en|force an oath, and give poignancy to bla&s;phemy, enjoy every temporal good &mdash;as even the unblemi&s;h'd &s;tate of childhood, when power is wanting to perpetrate intentional guilt&mdash;as the new-born babe frequently &s;truggles with various di&s;tre&s;s, at a time when its
<PB N="168" REF="169">weakne&s;s calls for peculiar &s;upports&mdash; wanting which its future exi&s;tence is &s;ometimes wa&s;ted under the languors of an un&s;ound con&s;titution&mdash;as the&s;e, with every other calamity I have re|capitulated, or advanced, through this letter&mdash;and as many more than can be po&s;&s;ibly &s;ugge&s;ted at a &s;ingle view, have, and do, actually light upon the human race&mdash;notwith&s;tanding all the comforts and all the ble&s;&s;ings in the world&mdash;&s;ome a&s;toni&s;hing &s;ource of con&s;olation is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to reconcile the&s;e facts to the mind. &mdash;To decide upon the matter (as was hinted before) agreeable to our ideas of rectitude, we &s;hould pronounce it, without he&s;itation, a mon&s;trous &s;y&s;tem, which confounds right and wrong, innocence and error. Natural
<PB N="169" REF="170">rea&s;on would condemn it as incon&s;i&s;|tent&mdash;Pagan philo&s;ophy would reject it as barbarous &mdash; pedantry would call it unfit&mdash;poetry would declare it unju&s;t&mdash;common &s;en&s;e would pro|nounce it ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>Here then, madam, the two comfort|able rea&s;ons I have promi&s;ed to give, as the only reconciling ones, that can po&s;&s;ibly make life &s;upportable, or the &s;trange intricacies of it con&s;i&s;tent, de&s;erve to be mentioned. They come to us, under the cherubic forms of FAITH and RELIGION&mdash;ju&s;t as we are &s;inking under our doubts, they come forward to di&s;pel them &mdash; they give &s;trength to rea&s;on&mdash;force to philo&s;o|phy, and illumination to con&s;cience&mdash; the wretched in&s;ulted heart li&s;tens to
<PB N="170" REF="171">their arguments, and finds them deci|&s;ive&mdash;revelation her&s;elf &s;teps into our relief&mdash;&s;he confe&s;&s;es, with the poet, there is apparent confu&s;ion in the regularity of Providence,&mdash;that the cloudy mirrour, through which the human eye is directed in purblind &s;peculation repre&s;ents the path of vir|tue as thorny and crooked, and the road to vice flowery and delightful &mdash;but that&mdash;were it po&s;&s;ible for men to wind with their Creator, through all the infinitude of mazes that lead from, fir&s;t cau&s;es, to ultimate effects&mdash;to view all the labyrinths which are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to connect, continue, and complete the &s;y&s;tem, the whole mat|ter would be inverted, and the re|gularity appear, without confu&s;ion&mdash;

<P>A future life, only&mdash;(in every in|&s;tance I have mentioned, and in many that I have omitted to mention) can make the pre&s;ent life &s;upportable, or the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem equitable. And upon the&s;e rational principles, I would argue the e&s;&s;entiality of that futurity&mdash;but not &s;o much from the power and wi&s;dom, as from the bene|volence of the hand that hath prepared us for it&mdash;nor is the attribute of ju&s;tice le&s;s concerned in this provi&s;ion&mdash;for &mdash;were the death of the body, the

<P>Let us argue this point from the impul&s;es of common &s;en&s;e&mdash;in our &s;urvey of the &s;ufferings of brutes, it
<PB N="177" REF="178">appeared that with a great deal le&s;s cau&s;e, they underwent, at any rate, as much hard&s;hip as men: our in&s;pection indeed into this matter, like our in|&s;pection into the calamities of our own &s;pecies, was &s;light and cur&s;ory; but were we to &s;et apart a &s;erious op|portunity to examine the &s;ubject to the bottom, we &s;hould find animal mi&s;ery as extended and as exqui|&s;ite as human. I admit that they are de&s;titute of rea&s;on, and it mu&s;t be owned that a <HI>moral</HI> &s;en&s;e of the in|juries men &s;uffer, frequently give poignancy to the angui&s;h: the mind takes, as it were, an intere&s;t in the &s;ufferings of the body; thus a blow on the face is re&s;ented, not becau&s;e of the pain, but becau&s;e of the idea annexed by the &s;oul to &s;uch an act&mdash;
<PB N="178" REF="179">and with re&s;pect to other mi&s;eries and accidents, the mind by &s;ympa|thizing often doubles them. This may be brought again&s;t me as an ar|gument. It is none, madam.

<P>The &s;tate of animals, after they leave the pre&s;ent world, has been the &s;ubject of very di&s;tingui&s;hed ta|lents; and &s;ome have very warmly contended for their immortality. Among&s;t &s;acred writers, Mo&s;es and Solomon, have leaned much in their favour: among&s;t moderns, Mr. Locke,

<P>Look, upon your Favourite&mdash; how harmle&s;s!&mdash;how affectionate!&mdash; would it not hurt you to con&s;ider, that in a very few years, the poor creature mu&s;t putrify in the du&s;t, and, mixing with it, &s;oon become com|mon earth, without hope of re&s;urrec|tion? for my part nothing could give a keener &s;hock to my &s;en&s;ibility than the horrid idea of univer&s;al annihi|lation
