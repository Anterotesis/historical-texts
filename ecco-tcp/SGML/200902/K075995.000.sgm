<HEAD>A LETTER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Would not thus have addre&s;s'd your Lord&s;hip in public, but that in the&s;e our days the pre&s;s is the only method by which I could gain admi&s;&s;ion to you, or have the opportunity, to u&s;e our old College phra&s;e, of a little CONFAB: Bi&s;hops and Curates are, I believe, at pre&s;ent &s;eldom &s;een together, except in the prayer for the Clergy. Fortune, my Lord, who brought us &s;o clo&s;e to|gether at the Univer&s;ity, where, you
<PB N="2" REF="5">
may remember, we were <HI>Chums,</HI> has at length
<Q>Saevo laeta negotio,</Q>
as the old bard &s;ings, in one of her &s;trange freaks, thrown us from the mo&s;t intimate connection into &s;tations of life at the utmo&s;t di&s;tance from each other, by making your Lord&s;hip a Bi&s;hop, and me an&mdash;A&s;&s;i&s;tant-Curate. I think, my Lord, I have &s;omewhere read, that in the Roman Triumphs a per&s;on was always appointed to attend the Conqueror, and as he pa&s;&s;ed along to repeat to him&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Thou art a man."</Q> The following pages may be con&s;idered as a &s;alutary hint of the &s;ame nature, and were only meant to lay on your Lord&s;hip's table, and as you &s;lip on your lawn, to whi&s;per to you&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Thou art a Clergyman."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="6">
Tho' I do not (to u&s;e the phra&s;e of a certain Right Reverend) <HI>ba&s;k in the Sun|&s;hine of the Go&s;pel,</HI> you will perceive, nowith&s;tanding, in the cour&s;e of this Letter, I am not &s;o much hurt by di&s;|appointments, but that I can laugh at a proper opportunity; at pre&s;ent, how|ever, I am perfectly &s;erious, and do from my heart think and declare, that the lea&s;t grateful acknowledgement which our dignified clergy can make, for the honours and rewards conferred on them, is to a&s;&s;i&s;t their di&s;tre&s;&s;ed brethren; to make u&s;e of their be&s;t endeavours to &s;up|port the dignity of the mini&s;terial office: and to gain them &s;ome deference and re&s;pect, if they <HI>can,</HI> or <HI>will,</HI> procure them nothing el&s;e: and yet this, my Lord, I will not &s;ay wherefore, or by whom, is of late years, mo&s;t &s;hamefully neglected.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="7">
Your Lord&s;hip, I am convinc'd by experience, is not without humanity; I have known &s;ome Bi&s;hops, (formerly I mean) who had not a grain of it in their whole compo&s;ition: but that is not your ca&s;e; I have therefore taken the liberty to appeal to you, in behalf of the inferior clergy of the&s;e kingdoms, who, I believe, are the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, de&s;erted, and de&s;pi&s;ed body of men, at pre&s;ent, on the face of the earth: into the cau&s;es of this, I propo&s;e cooly and candidly to examine, and to con&s;ult with your Lord|&s;hip concerning the mo&s;t probable me|thods of removing them.</P>
<P>I have a thou&s;and things to &s;ay to your Lord&s;hip, on this copious head, which I &s;hall re&s;erve for &s;ome future occa&s;ion, and for the &s;ake of method confine my&s;elf at pre&s;ent (tho' I hate confinement of every kind) to a particular branch of
<PB N="5" REF="8">
our &s;canty revenue, commonly known by the name of LECTURESHIPS.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip being much better ac|quainted with eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory than my&s;elf, could probably acquaint me with the origin and ri&s;e of the&s;e PAUPERTA|TIS SUBSIDIA: as I am not, however, very ambitious of tracing the &s;ource of this muddy &s;pring, I &s;hall defer the &s;earch to another opportunity, and content my|&s;elf with ob&s;erving (a truth which I am every day more and more convinced of) that the e&s;tabli&s;hment of <HI>Lecture&s;hips</HI> in and about London has been extremely prejudicial to the inferior Clergy of this kingdom, and contributed, in a great mea&s;ure, to bring upon the whole body that poverty and contempt into which they are now fallen; that the methods by which they are obtained are highly unbecoming our character, and the
<PB N="6" REF="9">
means made u&s;e of to &s;upport them in|adequate to the duty performed; that they are acquired, in &s;hort, with diffi|culty, lo&s;t with ea&s;e, and very few of them worth the keeping: which I will endeavour to prove to your Lord&s;hip in as few words as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>It may not, perhaps, be improper, when I talk of SERMONISERS, to follow the u&s;ual SERMON method, and divide my &s;ubject into three or four general heads; and tho' I would not, as Lord Shaft&s;bury &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"bring my two's and three's before a fa&s;hionable congrega|tion,"</Q> yet, as I am talking only to your Lord&s;hip, and what pa&s;&s;es may never go much further than our&s;elves, I may as well adopt the TEXTUAL manner; (there, my Lord, is a new word for John&s;on's Dictionary).</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="10">
I &s;hall proceed therefore,</P>
<P>FIRST,</P>
<P>To con&s;ider how LECTURESHIPS are canva&s;&s;ed for.</P>
<P>SECONDLY,</P>
<P>What is expected from them. And</P>
<P>THIRDLY and LASTLY.</P>
<P>How they are paid, and what emo|luments u&s;ually ari&s;e to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of them.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t therefore, my Lord, with regard to the <HI>canva&s;&s;ing</HI> for Lecture&s;hips, as u&s;ually practi&s;ed among&s;t us, I will ven|ture to a&s;&s;ert, it is an employment ut|terly incon&s;i&s;tent with the character, and unbecoming the dignity of a Cler|gyman, an office greatly beneath the attention of genius and learning, and
<PB N="8" REF="11">
highly un&s;uitable to all the notions of life imbibed in the cour&s;e of a genteel and liberal education.</P>
<P>The choice of a LECTURER in this metropolis is generally ve&s;ted in the whole body of the pari&s;h, con&s;i&s;ting, for the mo&s;t part, of ordinary trade&s;men, &s;ometimes very low mechanics, per&s;ons not always of the mo&s;t refined manners, or delicate &s;en&s;ations. Your Lord&s;hip, I am &s;ure, mu&s;t remember, how cava|lierly, when we were at Cambridge, (for which by the by we de&s;erved to be hor&s;e-whipped) we u&s;ed to treat the CANAILLE: if an hone&s;t trade&s;man came a dunning to our room of a morn|ing before Lecture, we tipped the NON DOMI upon him, or if by chance he gained admittance, and grew importu|nate in his &s;olicitations, without further ceremony &s;hewed him the neare&s;t way
<PB N="9" REF="12">
down &s;tairs. Little did &s;ome of us think what a different behaviour we &s;hould one day be obliged to a&s;&s;ume towards &s;ome of their illu&s;trious brethren in this me|tropolis.</P>
<P>The common people, my Lord, in this kingdom of liberty, are of &s;o com|bu&s;tible a nature, that the lea&s;t point of di&s;pute blows them up into a flame: a conte&s;t about Church-wardens, the choice of a &s;elect ve&s;try-man, or a paltry Lec|ture&s;hip &s;hall &s;et as many &s;ober citizens together by the ears as a County Elec|tion. To &s;ay the truth, there is now a days almo&s;t as much dirty work prac|tis'd in the Canva&s;&s;ing for one as for the other. The Par&s;on, as well as the Can|didate, mu&s;t play over, if he hopes for Succe&s;s, all the little low tricks of bribing the indigent, flattering the proud, ca|joling the rich, abu&s;ing and calumniating
<PB N="10" REF="13">
his antagoni&s;t, buying, making, &s;plitting, hiding votes; the whole catalogue, in &s;hort, of Mini&s;terial Artifices mu&s;t be practi&s;ed in the ve&s;try with as little con|&s;cience as on the Hu&s;tings; and a Can|didate for St. A&mdash;'s Church has almo&s;t as much mire to wade through, as a Can|didate for St. S&mdash;'s Chapel.</P>
<P>But, as I have heard &s;ay in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall, there is nothing like a CASE IN POINT; I will therefore treat your Lord&s;hip with one, to illu&s;trate the &s;ub|ject under con&s;ideration, and that ca&s;e, to prevent any mi&s;takes, &s;hall be&mdash;MY OWN.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip I believe may remem|ber the time when my poor Uncle died, which obliged me to quit the Univer&s;ity and &s;eek my fortune in town, where I had not been above three weeks before
<PB N="11" REF="14">
I &s;troll'd one Sunday afternoon into a Church in the City, and, after &s;ervice, heard the Clerk, by order of the Ve&s;try, declare the Lecture&s;hip of the pari&s;h va|cant, and invite the Clergy, however dignify'd or di&s;tingui&s;h'd, to be Candidates for it, and to give in their names by the en&s;uing Sunday. No &s;ooner did I hear this CHURCH SERJEANT thus beating up for recruits, than I immediately re|&s;olv'd to <HI>enli&s;t;</HI> and accordingly, the next day, waited on the wor&s;hipful <HI>Sten|tor</HI> above-mention'd, who took down my name and place of abode: on my de&s;iring him at the &s;ame time to acquaint me with the be&s;t method of proceeding, which I was an utter &s;tranger to, he advi&s;ed me as a friend, to apply as &s;pee|dily as po&s;&s;ible, to Mr. &mdash; a Chee&s;e|monger in &mdash; Lane, who was then fir&s;t Church-warden, a leading man in the Ve&s;try, and a per&s;on, he a&s;&s;ur'd me,
<PB N="12" REF="15">
on whom the Election would in a great mea&s;ure depend. I took hone&s;t AMEN'S advice, and by nine the next morning, not I mu&s;t own without &s;ome reluctance, dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf as well as I could, and waited on Mr. Church-warden. As &s;oon as he &s;aw me enter the Shop in my Canonicals, (for I had hired an excellent new gown and ca&s;&s;ock behind St. Clement's on the occa&s;ion) he made me a very low bow, gave me the title of Doctor, and imagining no doubt that I was come to be&s;peak chee&s;es for the coun|try, begg'd to know my <HI>honour</HI>'s com|mands; to which I replied in an humble tone, and looking extremely di&s;concerted, that I came to wait on him on account of the Lecture&s;hip of the pari&s;h, and begg'd the favor of his vote and intere&s;t, &amp;c. Your Lord&s;hip I am &s;ure would have &s;miled to &s;ee the &s;udden alteration of his features and behaviour: he dropp'd
<PB N="13" REF="16">
all the trade&s;man's ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s, and in a moment a&s;&s;umed the magi&s;terial air and dignity of a Church-warden; turn'd a&s;ide to a woman who was ju&s;t then a&s;king for a pound of Che&s;hire, and without addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me, cry'd out, <Q REND="inline">"this is the fourth par&s;on I have had with me to-day on the &s;ame er|rand:"</Q> then, &s;taring me full in the face; <Q REND="inline">"well, young man, &s;ays he, you intend to be a Candidate for this &s;ame Lecture: you are all to mount the NOSTRUM, I &s;uppo&s;e, and merit will carry it: for my part, I promi&s;e no|body, but remember I tell you before|hand, I am for <HI>voice</HI> and <HI>action,</HI> &s;o mind your hits."</Q> When he had &s;aid this, he immediately turn'd upon his heel, and went into the Counting-hou&s;e. I took my leave in an awkward manner, as you may &s;uppo&s;e, being not a little chagrin'd at his in&s;olence; and as I went
<PB N="14" REF="17">
out of the &s;hop, overheard his Lady ob|&s;erving, from behind the counter, that I was a pretty SPRIG of DIVINITY, but look'd a little SHEEPISH, and had not half the courage of the gentleman that had been recommended to her hu&s;band by MR. SQUINTUM.</P>
<P>The in&s;tant I quitted the &s;ign of the Che|&s;hire-Chee&s;e, I laid a&s;ide all thoughts of further &s;olicitation, and re&s;olved to return to college, and live on making Fellow-commoner's exerci&s;es, rather than &s;ub|ject my&s;elf any more to &s;uch mortifying indignities. Good God! thought I to my&s;elf, is this the fruit of my &s;tudies? this the reward of all my toil and labour in the univer&s;ity? to have the important point, whether I &s;hall eat or &s;tarve, at la&s;t determin'd by a CHEESEMONGER, who declares for VOICE and ACTION!</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="18">
In &s;pite, notwith&s;tanding, of this re|&s;olution, (for re&s;olutions, your Lord&s;hip knows, are much ea&s;ier made than kept) I was obliged in le&s;s than &s;ix months, having during that time taken it into my head to fall in love and marry, to repair once more to the great city, and put into the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical lottery; where, by the by, as in mo&s;t other lotteries, you buy &s;o dear, meet with &s;o few prizes, and run &s;o much hazard, that none but de&s;|perado's ought to venture in them: there, my Lord, I renew'd my &s;olicitations, and experienced all the mi&s;eries and mi&s;|fortunes, all the in&s;ults and indignities, which the pride and in&s;olence of the rich, both Laity and Clergy, inflict on their dependent brethren: the difficulties which I met with in &s;earch of a <HI>Lecture|&s;hip,</HI> for that was my <HI>Summum Bonum,</HI> are inconceivable; and I can a&s;&s;ure your Lord&s;hip, that, trifling as the emolu|ments
<PB N="16" REF="19">
are of this preferment, all the perfections of human nature united are &s;carce &s;ufficient to a man without per&s;o|nal intere&s;t, to in&s;ure his &s;ucce&s;s. The variety of di&s;tre&s;&s;es which I encountered from the different tempers and di&s;po&s;i|tions of the <HI>Gentlemen</HI> and <HI>Ladies</HI> (for &s;o I was obliged to call them) who had votes in the pari&s;h, the mean and abject flattery which I was forc'd to make u&s;e of, with the many frequent affronts and di&s;appointments I underwent, would &s;well half a melancholy volume. With|out enumerating the nece&s;&s;ary accom|pli&s;hments generally expected on the&s;e occa&s;ions of drinking hard with the hu&s;|bands, and &s;aying &s;oft things to their wives; in more pari&s;hes than one, my Lord, where I have been a Candidate, to &s;moak your half dozen of pipes, and drink two bottles at a &s;itting, are infi|nitely more nece&s;&s;ary perfections than
<PB N="17" REF="20">
any which you cou'd bring with you from the Univer&s;ity; and it is a maxim with many good citizens, that unle&s;s you are what they call a d&mdash;d hone&s;t fel|low, you can never be a good preacher, or an Orthodox Divine; in &s;hort, my Lord, and to be &s;erious, unle&s;s a poor Clergyman is every thing that he ought <HI>not</HI> to be, he can never be what is every man's wi&s;h, independent.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not in this place forget to mention one rock which young Divines are perpetually &s;plitting on in this voyage, and that is, Party: a Candidate mu&s;t take great care how he repeats his <HI>poli|tical Creed;</HI> as, if he declares him&s;elf on <HI>one</HI> &s;ide, he will inevitably be op|po&s;ed, &s;lander'd and in&s;ulted by the <HI>other;</HI> it behoves him therefore always to join with the &s;tronge&s;t: but, what is wor&s;t of all, if he is of no &s;ide, (which
<PB N="18" REF="21">
your Lord&s;hip well knows is the mo&s;t prudent way,) it is a million to one if he is &s;uffered to continue &s;o.</P>
<P>I remember, my Lord, when I &s;et up for the Lecture&s;hip of St. &mdash; the poli|tical Thermometer of the pari&s;h was very high; I had at that time, and retain to this moment, the utmo&s;t contempt for all parties; being &s;atisfied, as every man of common under&s;tanding mu&s;t be, that there is nothing but &s;elf-intere&s;t at the bottom of them: it was very difficult however, I found, to per&s;uade other men that I was not as fooli&s;h as them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>Mr. Alderman Grub, and Mr. De|puty Clove, the two leading men in the pari&s;h, were at that time, or at lea&s;t profe&s;&s;ed to be, of oppo&s;ite principles; the Alderman a &s;taunch Whig; the Deputy a reputed Tory; I waited on them both
<PB N="19" REF="22">
for their votes and intere&s;t, the con&s;e|quence of which was that I &s;ucceded with neither, both reproaching me with being of a different way of thinking from them&s;elves. The Alderman was extremely &s;orry he could not &s;erve me: he had a regard, he had heard, he ad|mired, &amp;c. but to be plain with me he was a&s;&s;ured I had drank tea at the De|puty's: and when I went to the Deputy: for <HI>my</HI> part, (I &s;hall never forget it, my Lord, to my dying day) <Q REND="inline">"for my part, (&s;aid he) I am of no &s;ide, I de&s;pi&s;e all parties what&s;omdever, but there are people whom &s;ome people can't like like other people: in &s;hort, I &s;hall always be glad to &s;ee you whil&s;t you are what you are; but remember, Mr. Par&s;on, if ever you dine with Alder|man Grub again&mdash;you under&s;tand me&mdash;your humble &s;ervant."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="23">
The&s;e, my Lord, are but an incon|&s;iderable part of the mi&s;eries and indig|nities which a poor <HI>Par&s;on</HI> is &s;ure to encounter with on this occa&s;ion, but half
<Q><L>the &s;purns</L>
<L>Which patient merit from th' unworthy takes.</L></Q>
For my own part, I cannot but think the very &s;ingle circum&s;tance of trape&s;ing about from door to door in one's <HI>Canonic|als,</HI> perhaps for a week, is &s;ufficient to deter any man who has the lea&s;t regard for cleanline&s;s and decorum from can|va&s;&s;ing for a <HI>City Lecture&s;hip.</HI> There is not in nature a more ridiculous &s;ight than a draggletail Divine, holding up his &s;patter'd <HI>Sacerdotals,</HI> and dabbling thro' dirty &s;treets and blind alleys in &s;earch of <HI>Civic</HI> preferment.</P>

<HEAD>A SHORT DIGRESSION CONCERNING GOWNS and CASSOCKS.</HEAD>
<P>A certain right reverend Prelate, now with God, (that I think, my Lord, is the phra&s;e when we &s;peak of <HI>departed Epi&s;copacy</HI>) had, among&s;t other reform|ing &s;chemes, entertain'd a de&s;ign of oblig|ing all the Clergy, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the Metropolis, to appear con&s;tantly in their proper <HI>Uniform,</HI> and on no account permitting them to be &s;een in public without a <HI>gown</HI> and <HI>ca&s;&s;ock:</HI> of what &s;ervice this reformation cou'd po&s;|&s;ibly be to religion and virtue I mu&s;t own I could never di&s;cover, whil&s;t the inconveniences attending it to the poor Clergy are &s;ufficiently obvious. It has been &s;aid, I know, by the advocates for this plan, that whenever a <HI>Clergyman</HI> ap|pears <HI>as &s;uch</HI> he will always meet with the re&s;pect due to his function, and that
<PB N="22" REF="25">
if he is not treated with civility he may thank <HI>him&s;elf</HI> for it: but let us examine a little, and &s;ee if <HI>the&s;e things are &s;o.</HI></P>
<P>You, my Lord, I make no doubt meet with all the deference and re&s;pect which are due to your exalted &s;tation and cha|racter: but I mu&s;t beg your Lord&s;hip not to attribute it to wrong motives, or ima|gine that the bows made to you in the &s;treet are a tribute to your <HI>ro&s;e</HI> and <HI>bever:</HI> the incen&s;e I a&s;&s;ure your Lord&s;hip is of|fered to the <HI>mitre</HI> only. The reverence is not paid to you as a pa&s;tor of the flock of Chri&s;t; it is your <HI>temporal</HI> and not your <HI>&s;piritual</HI> dignity that attracts the attention, and commands the homage of the multitude: it is not becau&s;e you have three thou&s;and &s;ouls under your care, but that you have three thou&s;and pounds per Annum. I have read, my Lord, and do verily believe, that there
<PB N="23" REF="26">
was a time, tho' not within our memory, when the <HI>Clergy</HI> of all ranks, dignify'd or undignify'd, met with &s;ome degree of re&s;pect, as &s;uch, even in this kingdom, but tho&s;e days are gone and pa&s;t, and &s;o very different are the manners of this age, that I would venture one of my be&s;t &s;ermons again&s;t your Lord&s;hip's la&s;t new gown and ca&s;&s;ock (we philo&s;ophers, my Lord, con&s;ider one another's wants) that if your Lord&s;hip, when you go next to the Hou&s;e of Peers, will &s;tep out of your chariot at Charing-cro&s;s, with|out your purple-fring'd gloves, your footman behind, or any other external mark that might betray your quality, you &s;hall walk from thence to Palace|yard without being once oblig'd to pull off your hat in return for any compli|ments paid to your <HI>cloth.</HI> Nobody, my Lord, in the&s;e our days, takes any notice of a <HI>gown</HI> and <HI>ca&s;&s;ock;</HI> except perhaps

<P>What is expected from <HI>Lecturers,</HI> and how they are generally treated when they become &s;o. Let us now then &s;up|po&s;e, that the poor Candidate, after going through all the&s;e fiery trials, &s;hould at length be &s;o fortunate as to make his calling and election &s;ure: behold him cho&s;en, licen&s;ed, and <HI>In-pulpited</HI> (there, my Lord, is another new word for you, and I &s;ee no rea&s;on why it is not as good as <HI>In&s;tall'd</HI>) he will find that <HI>&s;eat,</HI> or rather <HI>&s;tanding</HI> of honor a <Q REND="inline">"painful pre-eminence;"</Q> for, as high as he may

there imagine him&s;elf, not a creature who &s;its <HI>below</HI> but thinks him&s;elf far <HI>above</HI> him. Every man that gave you his vote will con&s;ider you from that day forth, and as long as you continue in that &s;ituation, as his inferior: he looks upon him&s;elf as one of your <HI>feeders,</HI> to whom you are indebted for your <HI>daily bread,</HI> and therefore expects you will honor him accordingly, and for this &s;pecial rea&s;on, becau&s;e if <HI>you</HI> withdraw your <HI>complai&s;ance, he</HI> may withdraw his&mdash;<HI>Sub&s;cription.</HI> But let us attend a little to the precarious tenure on which he holds his new preferment. When a man is in peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a good living, &s;carce any body takes notice of his preaching. It matters very little whether he is as elegant as <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reader is de&s;ired to fill up the&s;e blank &s;paces with the names of the be&s;t and wor&s;t Preacher he is acquainted with.</NOTE> &mdash; or
<PB N="28" REF="31">
as contemptible as Dr. &mdash;. But with a <HI>Lecturer</HI> the ca&s;e is extremely different; he is con&s;idered by his hearers as a kind of Divinity-cook, and is expected, like other cooks, to adapt every thing to every body's palate; and let him have ever &s;o much merit, 'tis a hundred to one he does not plea&s;e one in a hundred, for it is all whim and caprice. If he has a loud voice, perhaps he may be called a Brawler, he takes too much pains, labours, and &s;o forth; if he is weak and low, he is cen&s;ur'd as &s;piritle&s;s and inanimate; if his action is &s;low and &s;olemn, he &s;hall be termed li&s;tle&s;s and indolent; if it be &s;trong, and vary'd, it &s;hall be called vehement and theatrical: for the poor judges he is talking to never con&s;ider the different &s;ubjects to be treat|ed; that one may require &s;ober and com|po&s;ed behaviour in the utterance, another lively, &s;pirited, and diffu&s;ed ge&s;ture.</P>

<P><PB N="30" REF="33">
The following, my Lord, is a fact which happened to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Being engaged one whole week in writing an an&s;wer to a political Pamphlet again&s;t the D&mdash; of N&mdash; for which I had twenty pieces (more, by the by, than I got by preaching in a twelve-month) I ventured on the Saturday night to tran&s;cribe a di&s;cour&s;e of Tillot&s;on's, and preached it on the Sunday morning to a very polite audience: on my coming out of church, I was &s;aluted by one of the Over&s;eers with&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"thank you, Doc|tor, for your excellent Sermon; but let me tell you 'twas a dangerous topic for a young man; to be &s;ure you might have treated it a little more fully <HI>(ob&s;erve his complai&s;ance)</HI> but upon the whole it was really a good di&s;cour&s;e, and I am &s;ure all your own; but I remember a glorious one of
<PB N="31" REF="34">
Tillot&s;on's on that very &s;ubject. I re|member&mdash;that you do not indeed, my friend, replied I, (I could not help it, my Lord, for the life of me) for the &s;ermon you ju&s;t now heard is the very &s;ame, word for word, I a&s;&s;ure you, and you will find it when you go home, Vol. and page&mdash;&s;o and &s;o."</Q></P>
<P>But let a man preach his <HI>own</HI> &s;ermons, or any body's el&s;e, he can never expect to plea&s;e for any length of time; I have &s;carce ever known a Lecturer continue a favourite above two or three years: if he always preaches him&s;elf he grows tire|&s;ome, and if he puts in another he is cen&s;ured as idle and negligent: if his Deputy preaches better, or which is the &s;ame thing, <HI>appears</HI> to preach better than him&s;elf, it &s;inks the principal into con|tempt; and if the Deputy does not preach &s;o well, hints are given him that it
<PB N="32" REF="35">
would be better if &s;ome folks would do their own duty; add to this that, your con&s;tant Church-trotters and Text|markers, who take down the heads in their pocket-books, are always &s;moaking your &s;tale divinity, and expect a new di&s;cour&s;e to tickle their ears every Sun|day. We can &s;ee the &s;ame play at the theatre, hear the &s;ame &s;tory abroad, or read the &s;ame book at home, perhaps once in a month at lea&s;t, with plea&s;ure; but to li&s;ten to the &s;ame di&s;cour&s;e from a pulpit once in three years, though per|haps we do not actually remember a line more than the text, is, for what rea&s;on I know not, mo&s;t intolerable.</P>
<P>I am as throughly convinced as I am of my own Exi&s;tence that <HI>Lecture&s;hips</HI> greatly promote and increa&s;e <HI>Methodi&s;m.</HI> A de&s;ire of &s;triking out &s;omething new and uncommon <HI>to tickle the ears of</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="36">
<HI>the Groundlings</HI> has led many a plain well-meaning preacher into romantic &s;allies, and theatrical ge&s;tures, and in|&s;en&s;ibly drawn them into methodi&s;tical rant and enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>There never was a duller hound than that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Servitors</HI> as they are termed at <HI>Oxford,</HI> or what we call in Cambridge <HI>Sizers,</HI> go, at <HI>King's College,</HI> and there only, by the name of <HI>Hounds.</HI> Mr. Jones was a <HI>hound of King's.</HI></NOTE><HI>hound</HI> of King's, whom your Lord|&s;hip mu&s;t remember as well as my&s;elf, the famous <HI>Mr. Jones</HI> of St. Saviour's: he had preached for &s;ome time in the old Dog-trot &s;tile of Fir&s;t to the Fir&s;t, Secondly to the Second, and admin&s;ter'd his gentle &s;oporifics to no purpo&s;e for a year or two, when, finding it would not do, all on a &s;udden he &s;hook his ears, &s;et up a loud bark, and by mere dint of noi&s;e, vociferation, and grimace, mouth'd
<PB N="34" REF="37">
and bellow'd him&s;elf into reputation among&s;t the gentlemen of the <HI>Clink,</HI> out-heroded Herod, and almo&s;t eclips'd the fame of We&s;ley, Whitfield, and Madan.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed, my Lord, (to &s;peak in the <HI>Par&s;onic</HI> &s;tile) to my <HI>third general head,</HI> viz. the manner in which Lecture&s;hips are u&s;ually paid, which is equally injurious to our character and function.</P>
<P>I know a little too much of the world, my Lord, to expect that a Par&s;on &s;hould be paid like a Fir&s;t-rate Player, a Pimp, or a Lord of the Trea&s;ury, who&s;e incomes I believe are pretty near equal; but at the &s;ame time cannot help thinking, that a labourer in the Vineyard is as well worthy of his hire, as a Journeyman Carpenter, Ma&s;on, &amp;c. and has as good
<PB N="35" REF="38">
a right to two pound two on a Sunday as he has on a Saturday night; and yet not one in a hundred of us is paid in that proportion.</P>
<P>The Lecturer's box generally goes about with the re&s;t of the pari&s;h Beggars a little after Chri&s;tmas; and every body throws in their charity, (for it is always con&s;idered in that light) as they think proper. Were I to tell your Lord&s;hip how many paltry excu&s;es are made to evade this little annual tribute by the mean and &s;ordid, how very little is given even by the mo&s;t generous, and what an incon&s;iderable &s;um the whole generally amounts to, the recital would not afford you much entertainment, and, for aught I know might even give you &s;ome &s;mall concern.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="39">
You cannot imagine, my Lord, with what an envious eye we poor Lecturers have often looked over a Waiter's book at a Coffee-hou&s;e, where I have &s;een &s;uch a collection of guineas and half guineas as made my mouth water: to give le&s;s than a crown at lea&s;t, would be to the la&s;t degree ungenteel, for the immen&s;e trouble of handing a di&s;h of coffee, or a news|paper; whil&s;t the poor Divine, who has toil'd in the Mini&s;try for a Twelve|month, and half worn out a pair of ex|cellent lungs in the unprofitable &s;ervice, &s;hall think him&s;elf well rewarded with the noble donation of <HI>half a crown.</HI></P>
<P>But to illu&s;trate my &s;ubject, I will give your Lord&s;hip another &s;tory: there is nothing like a little painting from the life on the&s;e occa&s;ions: &s;uppo&s;e your&s;elf then, my Lord, an eye-witne&s;s of the
<PB N="37" REF="40">
following &s;cene, which pa&s;&s;ed not long &s;ince in a certain part of this Metro|polis.</P>
<P>Enter the Church-warden and Over|&s;eer into the &s;hop of Mr. Prim the Mer|cer&mdash;Well, Mr. Twi&s;t, what are your commands with me?&mdash;we are come to wait on your honor with the Lecturer's|book, Sir,&mdash;a voluntary &s;ub&s;cription of the inhabitants of the pari&s;h of St &mdash; for the &s;upport of&mdash;well, well, you need not read any further: what is it?&mdash;whatever you plea&s;e, Sir,&mdash;Aye, here's another load, another burthen: d'ye think I am made of gold? there's the poor's rate, the doctor's rate, the window rates, the devil's in the rates I think&mdash;however, I can't refu&s;e <HI>you;</HI> but I'll not give another year&mdash;here, Buckram, reach me half a crown out of the till&mdash;your Servant, Madam.&mdash;</P>

[A Lady comes out of a back parlour, walks thro' the &s;hop, and gets into a chair.]</STAGE>
<P>Aye, there's another tax&mdash;a guinea for two box tickets, as &s;ure as the benefit comes round, for my wife and daughter, be&s;ides chair-hire.</P>
<STAGE>[<HI>Twi&s;t</HI> &s;hakes his head.]</STAGE>
<P>O ma&s;ter Prim, ma&s;ter Prim! had not you better now have given us a guinea for the Doctor and his four children, and re&s;erved your half crown for the Lady, who, if I may judge from her garb and equipage, does not want it half &s;o much as the poor <HI>Par&s;on;</HI> but you will be in the fa&s;hion, &s;o give us your mite; &s;et down, Mr. Prim two and &s;ixpence,&mdash;Sir, good morrow to you&mdash;gentlemen, your &s;ervant,&mdash;</P>
<P>Such, my Lord, you &s;ee, is the force of fa&s;hion, and &s;uch the influence of ex|ample,
<PB N="39" REF="42">
that a con&s;tant Church-goer, and one perhaps who fancies him&s;elf a very good Chri&s;tian, &s;hall throw away <HI>one pound one</HI> with all the plea&s;ure ima|ginable for an evening's entertainment at the theatre, and at the &s;ame time grudge <HI>half a crown</HI> for two and fifty di&s;cour&s;es from the pulpit, which, if he turns to his arithmetic book, he will &s;ee amounts to about&mdash;three farthings a &s;ermon&mdash;and a &s;ober Citizen too, as Lady Townly &s;ays, fye! fye!</P>
<P>The&s;e, my Lord, are melancholy truths, and, though you and I who are philo&s;ophers may laugh at them, have made many an hone&s;t man's heart ake.</P>
<P>I will leave your Lord&s;hip to imagine, without entering any further into this &s;ubject, what the great and de&s;ireable emoluments mu&s;t be ari&s;ing from a
<PB N="40" REF="43">
<HI>Town-Lecture&s;hip:</HI> hardly equal at the be&s;t to the wages of a Journeyman Stay|maker, and by no means upon a level with the profits of drawers, coffee-hou&s;e waiters, or the footmen of our nobility. This very lucrative employment, not|with&s;tanding, as being too con&s;iderable for one man, is frequently &s;plit in two and divided, like the places of Po&s;t|ma&s;ter General, Secretary, &amp;c. among&s;t the great. I have my&s;elf the honor, my Lord, of being what is called a <HI>Joint-Lecturer,</HI> not having intere&s;t enough in the pari&s;h, where I had been <HI>Curate</HI> for twenty years, to &s;ecure the whole. I cannot indeed &s;o far agree with our old friend He&s;iod as to think <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">.</NOTE> the half better than the whole, but, em|bracing the <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Half a loaf is better than no bread.</NOTE> Engli&s;h in&s;tead of the
<PB N="41" REF="44">
Greek proverb, &s;it my&s;elf down con|tentedly, and eat my <HI>half loaf</HI> in quiet. But, to confe&s;s the truth, I find the profits of both preferments (for your Lord&s;hip &s;ees I am a <HI>plurali&s;t</HI>) rather too &s;mall, to provide, in the&s;e hard times, for the ne|ce&s;&s;ities of a growing family, and have lately been obliged to <HI>eke out</HI> matters by entering my&s;elf on my friend H&mdash;w's li&s;t. As there is &s;omething curious in this Mr. H&mdash;, both with regard to him&s;elf, and the bu&s;ine&s;s he is engaged in, I &s;hall beg leave to introduce him to your Lord&s;hip's acquaintance, as I be|lieve, during what I may call your <HI>mi|nority</HI> in the <HI>Church,</HI> no &s;uch character or occupation was in being.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know then, my Lord, that the ingenious Mr. H&mdash; has found out a new method of being &s;erviceable to the <HI>Clergy</HI> and him&s;elf, by keeping a
<PB N="42" REF="45">
kind of <HI>Eccle&s;ia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ical Regi&s;ter-office,</HI> or, more properly &s;peaking, a <HI>Divinity-&s;hop,</HI> in the city, where <HI>Par&s;ons</HI> are <HI>hired</HI> by the day, week, month, &amp;c. as occa&s;ion requires. For this purpo&s;e he keeps a regular alphabetical li&s;t of unemploy'd <HI>Divines,</HI> from the age of three&s;core and ten, to two and twenty, ready to be <HI>let out</HI> for certain &s;tipulated &s;ums, deduct|ing a proper <HI>premium</HI> for the <HI>agent</HI> from every one of them.
