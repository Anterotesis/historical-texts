<P>This account mu&s;t needs very much awaken the attention of our youth, e&s;pecially &s;uch as have no opportunity to &s;ee this big Man; I think my&s;elf, therefore, under an obli|gation to my young read|ers,

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Of the Giant's country, birth, parentage, and education.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS Swedi&s;h Giant was born at Oulo, or
<PB N="20" REF="18">Ula. a port town &s;ituated on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Bot|nick Bay in Finland, bor|dering on Ru&s;&s;ia, in the year 1709. His Father's name was <HI>Cajanus;</HI> a man of a good character, but better noted for his gi|gantick &s;ize, than for fa|mily or fortune; though without doubt he came from a race of Giants, which it is too trouble|&s;ome at this time to trace
<PB N="21" REF="19">to the original. His Mo|ther likewi&s;e was of an uncommon height, which exceeded &s;even feet; and his Si&s;ter, now living, is &s;till taller; who, perhaps, &s;hould &s;he live to &s;ee her Brother return, and know his good luck, may take it in her head to travel upon the &s;ame errand.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e Great Parents was our Giant born, and
<PB N="22" REF="20">his &s;ize proves he was no ba&s;tard.</P>
<P>His hone&s;t, careful old Father, be&s;towed on him an education &s;uitable to his own circum&s;tances, and his Son's capacity for learning, which never ap|peared very quick or live|ly; and endeavoured to plant in him, whil&s;t young, the &s;eeds of true honour and virtue. He likewi&s;e brought him up to indu&s;|try,
<PB N="23" REF="21">to work in the gar|den with the &s;pade, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to labour in the field in husbandry affairs, and in &s;hort, to get his bread by the &s;weat of his brow.</P>
<P>As no extraordinary e|vent attended his younger years, he eat, drank, and play'd like other youth, only more at a time, and grew fa&s;ter; we'll pa&s;s over this part of his life, and follow him to the next &s;tage.</P>

<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="24" REF="22">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Of the Giant's falling in love with a farmer's daughter, named</HI> Dolla Rucina: <HI>How he made known his pa&s;&s;ion to her father, and what recep|tion he met with.</HI></P>
<P>NEar to Oulo lived a|wealthy farmer, who had an only daughter of great beauty, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed
<PB N="25" REF="23">of all the virtues which render tho&s;e charms the more amiable: She was likewi&s;e trained from her infancy to indu&s;try, by the care and example of a good Mother, who taught her to &s;pin flax and wool; to milk the kine; to make chee&s;e and butter, and all that was nece&s;&s;ary for the female part, in the dairy, the hou&s;e, the garden, or the field; &s;o that &s;he had
<PB N="26" REF="24">no idle hours to &s;pend in dre&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Nor did &s;he need it; for nature had been very indulgent in plentifully be&s;towing gra|ces to &s;et her off, without any art or fallacy.</P>
<P>The perfections of this fair maid had taken deep root in our Giant's heart, &s;o that in her center'd all his happine&s;s. He had demon&s;trated a good judg|ment in placing his affec|tions
<PB N="27" REF="25">on one &s;o worthy: but how to gain her was the point. He &s;uffered Love's flame to &s;mother a long time in his brea&s;t, be|fore he dared to undertake this adventure. He was at this time a comely young man; and though he was tall, his &s;tature might have been di&s;pen&s;|ed with, had he cea&s;ed growing: but his conti|nuing to increa&s;e in bulk
<PB N="28" REF="26">and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> made him al|mo&s;t de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s: for he could not well ex|pect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> would venture her&s;elf with a man of &s;o prepo&s;terous a &s;ize.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e checks and rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;es, which pre&s;ented them&s;elves con|cerning the difficulty of this undertaking, he at length, with the courage of a Giant, pluck'd up a
<PB N="29" REF="27">good heart, and ventured one plea&s;ant evening to vi&s;it this fair dam&s;el, to whom he was not altoge|ther a &s;tranger. She re|ceived him with great di&s;cretion and caution, and he behaved with much po|litene&s;s and good manners.</P>
<P>After &s;ome little time he addre&s;s'd him&s;elf to <HI>Dolla Rucina</HI>'s father, and with a graceful air told his errand; and with great
<PB N="30" REF="28">mode&s;ty de&s;ired his per|mi&s;&s;ion to vi&s;it his charm|ing daughter, the lovely <HI>Dolla Rucina;</HI> and tho' his de&s;igns were &s;trictly honourable, he would not enter upon a bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;o great a concern without his leave.</P>
<P>The father an&s;wer'd, Thou ha&s;t done well, young man, in fir&s;t mak|ing known this affair unto me; but what thou aske&s;t
<PB N="31" REF="29">is of &s;o great moment, that it requires much con|&s;ideration: I cannot there|fore immediately con&s;ent to what thou require&s;t, till I have well weighed it in my own mind. Tell me, therefore, thy name, parentage, and place of abode. The young Giant an&s;wered, My name is <HI>Daniel Cajanus,</HI> &s;on of the old <HI>Cajanus,</HI> of Oulo. An hone&s;t and reputable fami|ly,
<PB N="32" REF="30">replied the old man: thy father was not un|known to me. Thou &s;halt be welcome to my hou&s;e, and to &s;uch good cheer as it will afford.</P>
<P><HI>Dolla Rucina</HI>'s parents entertain'd <HI>Cajanus</HI> with bowls of mo&s;t delicious cream; pails of &s;yllabub; fre&s;h chee&s;e and butter; all &s;orts of choice fruit that their garden or orchard produced; with &s;everal
<PB N="33" REF="31">kinds of refre&s;hing liquors; and, what was more dear to him than all other de|lights, a reception which gave him great hopes, that one day he &s;hould obtain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t love|ly object of his affection.</P>
<P>Our young Giant be|ing thus fortunate in his fir&s;t adventure, often re|&s;orted to this fair maiden, who as con&s;tantly receiv|ed him; and, with her
<PB N="34" REF="32">parents leave, entertained him in the &s;ame generous manner; plentifully, and yet prudently, regaling him with good cheer, and a hearty welcome.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P><HI>How the Giant was di&s;ap|pointed in gaining the fair</HI> Dolla Rucina; <HI>and what followed.</HI></P>
<P>AFter a con&s;iderable time &s;pent in court|ing the beautiful <HI>Dolla Rucina,</HI> wherein &s;ucce&s;s &s;eemed to favour all <HI>Caja|nus</HI>'s wi&s;hes, and he even rioted in exce&s;s of plea|&s;ures;
<PB N="36" REF="34">the parents of this fair maid, to whom &s;he was very dear, told her with much tenderne&s;s, le&s;t it &s;hould cau&s;e too great an unea&s;ine&s;s in her mind; for &s;he had, during the vi&s;its of <HI>Cajanus,</HI> conceiv|ed a very good liking to his per&s;on; his great bulk was the only objection, and the remarks which the world made of the di&s;pro|portion in their &s;ize. That
<PB N="37" REF="35">they &s;hould inform <HI>Caja|nus,</HI> at his next vi&s;it, that they could not approve of a match &s;o unequal; that they were &s;orry they had not broke it off &s;ooner; and advi&s;ed their daughter no longer to entertain thoughts of marrying a man who&s;e &s;ize exceeded all rea&s;on. <HI>Dolla Rucina,</HI> ever obedient to her pa|rents, promi&s;ed them that &s;he would no longer re|ceive
<PB N="38" REF="36">him upon that foot|ing; but as they com|manded only.</P>
<P>The great di&s;proportion in their &s;ize had often given much di&s;quietude to the&s;e lovers, and interrupt|ed their greate&s;t and mo&s;t innocent enjoyments, long before <HI>Dolla Rucina</HI> had received this injunction from her father.</P>
<P>She at this time reach'd but a little above <HI>Cajanus</HI>'s
<PB N="39" REF="37">wa&s;te, and was of an agree|able &s;ize, and not likely to be taller. He, who alrea|dy &s;urpa&s;s'd all mankind in heighth, was &s;till growing on apace, as if he intend|ed to tower above the skies.</P>
<P>It was likewi&s;e a great mortification to the hap|pine&s;s of this unequal pair, to hear them&s;elves ridicul'd upon that ac|count, by all the young
<PB N="40" REF="38">people in the country round about; to whom this court&s;hip was well known, and which afford|ed them much diver&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Dolla Rucina</HI> de&s;ired leave of her father, that &s;he her&s;elf might make this affair known to <HI>Ca|janus:</HI> to which he free|ly con&s;ented.</P>
<P>This fair dam&s;el had that &s;ame evening re&s;o|lution enough to tell <HI>Ca|janus</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="39">all that her father and mother advi&s;ed her to, which was calculated for the good of them both: and this &s;he broke to him in the following manner.</P>
<P>After a deep &s;igh, &s;he &s;aid, Dear <HI>Cajanus,</HI> thou ha&s;t need to arm thy&s;elf with all the fortitude thou art ma&s;ter of, le&s;t what I have to tell thee wound &s;o deep, that it overwhelm thy poor &s;pirit. Alas!
<PB N="42" REF="40"><HI>Dolla Rucina</HI> has this day received a &s;trict charge from her parents, no lon|ger to entertain thee on any other terms than that of a friend. This charge from my father is of &s;o much con&s;equence, and concerns the happine&s;s of us both, that I cannot di&s;|obey it.</P>
<P><HI>Cajanus</HI> at this news was &s;truck dumb, not one word could he utter, till
<PB N="43" REF="41">after &s;ome time; he with|drew, gave vent to his pa&s;&s;ion in a torrent of tears which flowed from his eyes in great abundance.</P>
<P><HI>Dolla Rucina</HI>'s parents endeavoured by rea&s;on to pacify his great grief, but no arguments made any impre&s;&s;ion; time only was to recover him.</P>
<P>However, in &s;ome little time he began to recollect him&s;elf; to walk, talk,
<PB N="44" REF="42">and u&s;e his rea&s;on. And before his departure they regaled him with curds, cream, and other country fare, as u&s;ual; which <HI>Ca|janus</HI> was a dear lover of, and fed pretty cheerfully upon.</P>
<P>After this refre&s;hment he bid adieu to his dear <HI>Dolla Rucina,</HI> paid his re|&s;pects to her worthy pa|rents, and then walk'd lei|&s;urely home, with a belly

<P><HI>Of the Giant's re&s;olving to leave his country: How he was invited into the army; and what follow|ed.</HI></P>
<P>THE di&s;appointment which <HI>Cajanus</HI> met with in his love-adven|ture, was &s;oon &s;pread over the town of Oulo, and the neighbouring villages;
<PB N="49" REF="47">that he became the je&s;t of all the young people of tho&s;e parts, to whom this amour was well known. He &s;hut him&s;elf up there|fore from &s;ociety, refu&s;|ing any longer to appear in publick: and upon this account came to a fixed re&s;olution of leaving his native place, and vi&s;iting foreign climates.</P>
<P>There happen'd at this time to be recruiting offi|cers
<PB N="50" REF="48">in the town of Oulo, who were rai&s;ing men for the &s;ervice of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who was then about a&s;&s;embling a large army for the recovery of Finland from the Ru&s;&s;ians, or &s;ome other important enterprize; being &s;pirited up by the artful contri|vance of a mitred prie&s;t, who was chief in the ca|binet of a great prince.</P>
<P>The&s;e officers being in|&s;ormed
<PB N="51" REF="49">of the Giant's de|&s;ign of going abroad, en|deavoured to engage him to enter into the army; to which end they tempt|ed him with money; they promi&s;ed to get him pro|moted: but neither of the&s;e allurements had any influence on <HI>Cajanus.</HI></P>
<P>It was likewi&s;e &s;trongly repre&s;ented to him, how much his king and coun|try &s;tood in need at that
<PB N="52" REF="50">time of his &s;ervice, and the honour he might get to him&s;elf. He was &s;till deaf to all this; and cho&s;e rather to leave his coun|try and kindred expo&s;ed to the havock and mi&s;ery of war, than to lend them his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>

<P><HI>How the example of &s;ome mighty Giants of old was propo&s;ed to</HI> Cajanus; <HI>how be rejected them with di&s;dain: and whether this great Swedi&s;h Gi|ant is not a very great coward.</HI></P>
<P>THE fir&s;t is <HI>Goliah,</HI> the great Giant of Gath, who made the
<PB N="54" REF="52">whole ho&s;t of the I&s;raelites to quake: Even King Saul him&s;elf, who was taller than any man in his army, and a valiant &s;oldier too, was afraid of this great Phili&s;tine. He went out day by day, and vaunted out his in&s;olent &s;peeches, and hold threats of pick|ing their bones, and giv|ing their fle&s;h to the fowls of the air and bea&s;ts of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. This put Saul and
<PB N="55" REF="53">his army into &s;o great a panick, that had it not been for the fortunate &s;tone from the &s;ling of young David, the &s;on of Je&s;&s;e, it might have gain|ed the Phili&s;tine army the victory.</P>
<P>The next is the &s;trong and valiant <HI>Samp&s;on;</HI> who, when he was laid down to repo&s;e him&s;elf, and his enemies were &s;tealing un|awares to &s;eize him; it
<PB N="56" REF="54">was no &s;ooner called out to him, <HI>Samp&s;on, the Phi|li&s;tines are upon thee;</HI> but he &s;tarts up, lays hold of the fir&s;t weapon in his way, even the jaw-bone of an a&s;s, with which he laid about him &s;o fa&s;t, that he &s;mote them hip and thigh, and after he had &s;urveyed the &s;lain, he &s;at down and compo&s;ed a &s;ong of tri|umph; viz. <HI>Heaps upon heaps: with the jaw-bone
<PB N="57" REF="55">of an a&s;s I have &s;lain a thou&s;and men.</HI> True cou|rage never wants a wea|pon.</P>
<P>We read in the Hi&s;to|ry of the Kings of I&s;rael, of the mighty Tachmo|nite, named <HI>Adino,</HI> who &s;lew eight hundred at one time. And of <HI>Eleazar,</HI> the &s;on of Dodo, who rout|ed a whole army. Sacred Writ mentions many &s;uch &s;tout champions who de|voted
<PB N="58" REF="56">their &s;ervice for the defence of their country. Profane hi&s;tory relates the &s;ame of all their great heroes.</P>
<P>The noble actions of the&s;e brave old Giants, was no inducement to <HI>Ca|janus;</HI> he was afraid of being placed in the front of the battle, to have the rough mu&s;ick of musket balls whi&s;tling in his ears. The thoughts of this was
<PB N="59" REF="57">death to him. How far &s;hort does this Swedi&s;h Giant's courage fall of Gi|ant Gogmagog's, who, even now in his old age, will &s;tand the fire of a whole regiment of our va|liant city train'd-bands, without winching? and his &s;tout brother Corineus will do the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Giant <HI>Cajanus</HI> would hearken to no propo&s;als of going into the army; and
<PB N="60" REF="58">told the recruiting officers that he look'd upon what they had promi&s;ed, as on|ly to inveigle and trappan him, and not in their power to perform; and therefore gave them an ab&s;olute denial, that he would not accept of a &s;oldier's life: and refu&s;ed to be &s;een by them any more.</P>
<P>As Giant <HI>Cajanus</HI> grew up, he &s;hewed a le&s;&s;er
<PB N="61" REF="59">inclination to a military life than was expected: for in&s;tead of a brave mar|tial &s;pirit, of gaining glo|ry in the field of war, he had a natural aver&s;ion to the life of a &s;oldier; and cho&s;e rather to travel like a vagabond, to &s;hew his great bulk for lucre: which &s;hews that the big|ge&s;t men have not always the &s;toute&s;t hearts.</P>
<P>How plea&s;ant would it
<PB N="62" REF="60">have been for future ages to have read in the Swe|di&s;h chronicle of the glo|rious atchievements of the great <HI>Cajanus,</HI> when he appeared in the day of battle in the fore front of the army? that to him, in a great mea&s;ure, might be owing, victory again&s;t the Ru&s;&s;ians.</P>
<P>He might have been made to look very terrible and fierce, by gracing his
<PB N="63" REF="61">head with a &s;tately &s;trong helmet, properly adorn'd, which might have added to his &s;tature two or three foot; and given him a hand&s;ome &amp; &s;trong &s;hield; likewi&s;e to have fenced his body with armour of po|li&s;h'd &s;teel, and a &s;word an&s;werable to his great &s;ize; &s;o to have equipp'd him every way like a man of war. And then, if he had had no true courage
<PB N="64" REF="62">of his own, he might have pretended to vaunt it out with big words, like the braggadocias of Totten|ham-court, of what they can do; though they ne|ver de&s;ign to hurt their powerful antagoni&s;t. Such language, perhaps, might intimidate an enemy, and thereby have gain'd ad|vantage to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Giant <HI>Cajanus</HI> had been privately inform'd, that the
<PB N="65" REF="63">recruiting officers expect|ed an order to pre&s;s him into the King's &s;ervice, he therefore agrees with the captain of a &s;hip to carry him to Holland.</P>
<P>He immediately pre|pares for his voyage, takes leave of all his friends, and before his departure he went and took his la&s;t farewel of the charming <HI>Dolla Rucina,</HI> and her good father and mother.
<PB N="66" REF="64">They gave him a hearty welcome: &s;o that having eat of their meat and drank of their nectar, they em|braced with great tender|ne&s;s, and bid a final adieu to each other.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have told my readers, that <HI>Dolla Ruci|na</HI> was now married to a young farmer, who&s;e fa|ther was lately dead, and had left him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a rich farm. They were

<P>GIant <HI>Cajanus,</HI> having provided all things nece&s;&s;ary for this voyage, and the &s;hip being ready to fail, went aboard as private as he could; where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ving &s;tow'd him&s;elf in the great cabbin, not car|ing

<P><HI>Cajanus</HI> was well u&s;ed by the captain, who en|tertain'd him with his
<PB N="70" REF="68">adventures in many voy|ages and travels to foreign parts, and the dangers he e&s;cap'd; very plea&s;ant to hear, but too much to relate in this Hi&s;tory. <HI>Ca|janus,</HI> in his turn, enter|tain'd the captain with his own adventures by land: the&s;e relations were often &s;ea&s;on'd with good bowls of punch, canns of flip, and other refre&s;hing li|quors. And thus they
<PB N="71" REF="69">&s;pent their time, during a &s;afe and quick pa&s;&s;age to Holland; in which no real dangers or misfor|tunes happen'd: except|in a &s;tiff gale of wind, which they met with one evening off the coa&s;t of Norway, which obliged them to hand all their top-fails, and to fail under them three coa&s;ts: there run a very great head-&s;ea, and the &s;heets being clo&s;e
<PB N="72" REF="70">haul'd, &s;he made but dull way thro' the water; it was be&s;ide dark hazy wea|ther. The failors had of|ten been in greater &s;torms than that, and &s;o made light of it. But the ca&s;e of poor <HI>Cajanus</HI> was quite different; he expected no|thing le&s;s than to be &s;wal|lowed up every minute by the waves. The &s;hip &s;ometimes heel'd gunnel too, which is common in
<PB N="73" REF="71">a gale of wind; this &s;o much added to <HI>Cajanus</HI>'s fright, to &s;ee the water come upon deck, that he laid him&s;elf along, and held fa&s;t by &s;ome ropes at the weather-&s;ide, where he was continually &s;liding over to leeward, and crawl|ing back again: and &s;o, like Si&s;iphus with his &s;tone, his work was never done.</P>
<P>The &s;ailors endeavour'd to hearten him up at this
<PB N="74" REF="72">time; but nothing would do, till <HI>Cajanus</HI> &s;aw the &s;torm abate, day-light ap|pear, and a brave bowl of punch before him: He then look'd as &s;tout as the be&s;t man aboard the &s;hip.</P>
<P><HI>Cajanus</HI> arriv'd &s;afe in Holland, and having made the be&s;t advantage he could there, being told how fond the Engli&s;h people are of foreign novelties, e&s;pecial|ly of a tame Giant, he

<P><PB N="78" REF="76">UPon the fir&s;t notice of the arrival of this Grant at Charing-cro&s;s, his fame was &s;oon &s;pread over the whole town; &s;o that there was a great re|&s;ort of per&s;ons of all ranks to &s;ee him, at <HI>one Shilling</HI> each; which was a great profit to <HI>Cajanus,</HI> and an encouragement he ought to have been contented with.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="77">Giant <HI>Pinchbone,</HI> who is better known for viva|city of parts, and a pene|trating genius, than for enormous heighth, or bulk of body; vi&s;iting among other company, and ob|&s;erving how well plea&s;ed every one was with the &s;ight of him, began pre|&s;ently to medltate and contrive how he might make advantage to him&s;elf by &s;hewing this huge man.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="78">In a little time, by fre|quent vi&s;its, he became &s;o well acquainted with Gi|ant <HI>Caianus,</HI> that he ob|&s;erved him to be of a ve|ry covetous temper; and therefore was to be at|tack'd on that quarter. Ac|cordingly, an offer being made, he &s;oon li&s;tned to the propo&s;al; and at la&s;t agreed, that Giant <HI>Pinch|bone,</HI> for a &s;um of money (&s;ome &s;ay <HI>two hundred

<P>SOon after <HI>Puff</HI> had &s;old him&s;elf, the De|vil's Agent came to <HI>Pinch|bone,</HI> to &s;ee if he would

<P>The great Giant <HI>Puff</HI> was not &s;o big a fool, but he under&s;tood the Agent's bu&s;ine&s;s: he grew very unea&s;y at what he had done: and was afraid that he had already enter'd in|to Articles with the De|vil.

He then ri&s;es up, and &s;urprizes all &s;pectators with his great heighth and bigne&s;s. And hav|ing &s;talk'd backwards and forwards in his room, half a dozen turns, and entertain'd the company
<PB N="105" REF="103">with a &s;ong, in a voice as loud as the great pipe of a large organ, and in a tune like <HI>Tidde-doll over his gingerbread;</HI> he drinks another gla&s;s, and perhaps another, if he fancies it. Then he &s;hews how high he can reach; an&s;wers ci|vil que&s;tions, and &s;uffers &s;ome parts of his body to be mea&s;ur'd; and the&s;e are the chief exploits he performs, excepting it be
<PB N="106" REF="104">to &s;nuff a candle, or to let a fart.</P>
<P>His heighth was eight foot, four inches; and the bigne&s;s of his body and limbs was once in ju&s;t proportion. But now his legs are gouty and ill &s;ha|pen; his knees knock to|gether; his body bowed, that it &s;eems painful for him to &s;tretch, or rai&s;e him&s;elf up. His head likewi&s;e hung down, and
<PB N="107" REF="105">his cheeks are pinched; his looks fickly, and all his parts greatly wa&s;ted. His hands and fingers are very long and &s;lender; his feet and toes the &s;ame.</P>
<P>He is now thirty three years of age, and has been done growing about eight.</P>
<P>I have now, my young readers, given you the &s;tate and way of life of this gigantick young man,
<PB N="108" REF="106">who for the &s;ake of a lit|tle lucre has de&s;troy'd his health, wanting air and exerci&s;e. Whereas with a proper u&s;e of his parts, and due care, he might have liv'd to have been an old robu&s;t Giant, and de&s;cended to his grave loaden with honours and renown; as the brave Giants of old time.</P>
<P>And it was in order to prevent his being utterly
<PB N="109" REF="107">ten to the world, as al&s;o to oblige my young read|ers, that I have been at the pains to publi&s;h this gigantick <HI>Hi&s;tory of his Life;</HI> and I doubt not but I &s;hall be as hand|&s;omely rewarded for it, as I was for writing that of the two Giants my worthy next neighbours, old Gogmagog and Cori|neus.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="108">He is now attended by phy&s;icians and &s;urgeons; and is in &s;uch a dange|rous way, as &s;eems to forebode a &s;peedy di&s;&s;olu|tion.</P>

<P><HI>A &s;tory of the Giant's going to &s;ee a review; his be|ing made an en&s;ign in the army; and how be quitted his colours.</HI></P>
<P>AS I would no ways derogate from our Giant's reputation for exploits in war, I think my&s;elf oblig'd to relate a
<PB N="112" REF="110">&s;tory I have lately heard, tho' I cannot atte&s;t the truth of it. It is this:</P>
<P>There being a review of the troops a&s;&s;embled in Finland, the Giant was per&s;waded by &s;ome of his acquaintance to go to &s;ee it. The hand&s;ome ap|pearance the officers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> made, was much admired by all that &s;aw them. This fine &s;ight &s;o well plea&s;ed <HI>Cajanus</HI> (for &s;o we may
<PB N="113" REF="111">now call him, as he is his own ma&s;ter again) that he accepted of an en&s;ign's place, on promi&s;e, that if he di&s;liked a &s;oldier's life, he &s;hould be at liberty to quit the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>He being mea&s;ured, cloath'd and arm'd, enter'd into pre&s;ent pay; but he &s;talk'd about very awkard|ly in his new equipments, and &s;eldom in his proper place.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="112"><HI>Cajanus</HI>'s brother offi|cers &s;oon perceiv'd, that tho' he was of a great bulk, he wanted courage; on which account he could do but little good in the front of an army, except|ing to look big, and to help &s;care an enemy that did not know him. But the front was a po&s;t that great <HI>Goliah</HI> could by no means like, except at a re|view, and in time of peace.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="113">In &s;hort, even the com|mon &s;oldiers took upon them to make game of this tall en&s;ign, nay, challeng'd and affronted him conti|nually; knowing he had not the heart to re&s;ent it.</P>
<P>After a little time, a ru|mour was &s;pread, that the Ru&s;&s;ians were arming, de|&s;igning to drive the Swedes out of Finland.</P>
<P>Upon this news, &s;ome of the young officers, who
<PB N="116" REF="114">look'd &s;o gay at the re|view, fell &s;ick; others &s;old, or flung up their commi&s;&s;ions. <HI>Cajanus,</HI> for his part, neither ask'd leave to quit, nor try'd to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ell, but threw down his flag, and got away in the night as fa&s;t as he could.</P>

<P><HI>How the Giant went to vi&s;it</HI> Gogmagog <HI>and</HI> Corineus <HI>in Guildhall.</HI></P>
<P>IT happen'd that during the time this mighty <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Giant was his own ma&s;ter, he was pre|&s;ented with the <HI>Gigantick Hi&s;tory of the two famous Giants in Guildhall, Lon|don;</HI>
<PB N="118" REF="116">at the &s;ight of which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s his &s;urprize and delight: But upon hearing it read, his countenance fell; and he was much alarm'd, le&s;t he &s;hould not appear to great a curio&s;ity, as he would fain make the world believe. He was inform'd that they were Giants of nice honour, but no ways quarrel&s;ome, unle&s;s they were fir&s;t affronted. Up|on
<PB N="119" REF="117">this, he re&s;olved to make them a vi&s;it in a private manner, to &s;ee if he could di&s;cern any linea|ments of his ance&s;tors or kindred in their faces. Accordingly, he &s;queez'd him&s;elf into a coach, &s;it|ting almo&s;t double, and drove clo&s;e to Guildhall. As he enter'd the great door, he had pre&s;ently the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing, and paying obei&s;ance to Gog|magog
<PB N="120" REF="118">and Corineus, tho&s;e two brave old city champions. He was &s;ome|what aba&s;h'd at the fierce|ne&s;s of their looks, their warlike habits, and &s;tate|ly deportment; in which he &s;aw nothing that was akin to him&s;elf. The two old Giants &s;tood &s;tiff to their po&s;ts, taking very little notice of him; he appearing to them more like the gho&s;t of a Giant
<PB N="121" REF="119">than any thing el&s;e: and tho' he came ju&s;t about twelve a-clock, as if he expected an invitation to dinner, when they &s;tepp'd down; he was entirely di&s;appointed if he did: perhaps they might have but &s;hort commons that day; or might judge by his looks, that he would with much more intre|pidity attack a &s;heep than he would a lion.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="120">The people began to gather about the &s;trange Giant from all parts of the Hall; but he, not caring to be &s;tar'd at too much, &s;trides gently up to the Book&s;ciler's, next the Gi|ants, look'd at his books, then turns him&s;elf round, and without &s;aying one word, takes two or three colo&s;&s;us &s;trides acro&s;s the Hall, into the coach, and away he goes: the people
<PB N="123" REF="121">gazing after him, as if they had &s;een the apparition of &s;ome Giant, which has been &s;aid to happen before their death.</P>
<P>Now methinks I hear the Giant, upon hearing this read to him, mutter in broken Engli&s;h, <HI>A lye! A lye! A lye!</HI> Be that as it will; the next time he comes to Guildhall without giving notice, he will be in danger of being &s;queez'd into <HI>Little-ea&s;e.</HI></P>
