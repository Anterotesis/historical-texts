<HEAD>A LETTER To the Reverend Mr. Dean <HI>Swift, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Doctor,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Thank you, in the Name of the Publick, for your continuing to be u&s;eful, notwith&s;tanding you are a dignify'd Churchman. The celebrated Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> talk|ing of the Clergy in the Hou&s;e of Commons, &s;aid, <HI>That as their Preach|ing was the Cau&s;e of their Preferment,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="4"><HI>&s;o they made their Preferment the Cau&s;e of their not Preaching;</HI> and, when I knew you were made a Dean, I grew in mortal Fear that you would live <HI>like your Brethren,</HI> and be good for nothing. I confe&s;s a Deanary is a very good Rea&s;on for being idle; and we infer that you are of the &s;ame Mind, from your not having once &s;et the three Kingdoms a-laughing in five Years together; whereas you u&s;ed for|merly, when you had Wit in Pocket|fulls, and no Money, to be tickling the Sides of Mankind once a Week, at lea&s;t: What a Misfortune is it, that the rich Man &s;hould always thus &s;poil the merry Fellow?</P>
<P>I my &s;elf find it by Experience, that Plenty is a damn'd Baulk to Mirth; for I am always dull in Pro|portion to my Ca&s;h, and witty in Proportion to the Feeblene&s;s of my Pur&s;e: When I am Ma&s;ter of a few Half Crowns, you would &s;wear, by my Looks and Heavine&s;s, I were an elder Brother, or an Alderman, &s;uch a magi&s;terial Stupidity do I carry about me: However, for my Com|fort,
<PB N="7" REF="5">
I am &s;eldom attack'd by this Fit of Lethargy above <HI>once a Year.</HI></P>
<P>On the other Hand, when there is a Famine in my Fob, my Head is in the be&s;t Plight in the World, and I can write a Pamphlet in half an Hour. <HI>NEC ONUS, NEC FRAE|NUM;</HI> a Colt, or a Girl, or a young Cat, has not more Tricks and Live|line&s;s.</P>
<P>One Day, (I &s;hall never forget it!) as I was rai&s;ing a <HI>Gho&s;t,</HI> or de&s;crib|ing a <HI>Mon&s;ter,</HI> or committing a <HI>hor|rid and bloody Murder,</HI> Faith, I can't tell which, but one of them it was, and the Pre&s;s and the Hawkers both &s;tood &s;till for it; I &s;ay, upon that &s;elf-&s;ame Day, when I began, with my u&s;ual Elegance, to flouri&s;h and form my Periods, I felt an unu&s;ual Slowne&s;s in my Invention; and my Fancy, though I pump'd it again and again, and drew it by all its Teats, would not yield one Drop of Milk, and I could not, for the Heart of me, <HI>make my Readers wonder.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="6">
In this deplorable and never-enough to be lamented Dulne&s;s, what does me I do, but &s;earch fir&s;t in my Noddle, and then in my Breeches, for the <HI>&s;trange</HI> Ground of my pre&s;ent Woe and Unfruitfulne&s;s; and, to my great A&s;toni&s;hment, in a private Corner of my Pocket lurk'd a crooked Six|pence, <HI>unfelt 'till then by human Finger.</HI> The Rea&s;on of its long Im|pri&s;onment was, that in many Months I had never &s;ent my Hand on any Me&s;&s;age into my Pocket, as well know|ing <HI>it had no Bu&s;ine&s;s there.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had laid my Hands on this <HI>&s;ingle Inhabitant,</HI> I re&s;olv'd to make an Example of him, and drown'd him immediately, without Mercy, in half a Pint of <HI>Sherry.</HI> I then went readily and chearfully to work, and having now neither Lett nor Mole&s;tation, fini&s;h'd my Gho&s;t with good Reputation to my &s;elf; for it was reckon'd the very be&s;t and mo&s;t terrible Apparition that haunted <HI>Grub|&s;treet</HI> that Evening.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="7">
I have not met with <HI>&s;uch another Ob&s;tacle</HI> in all the numerous Pam|phlets which I have &s;ince produc'd. While I have any Ca&s;h, I neither think, nor &s;peak, nor write, but ram|ble, and drink, and pay; and when I can pull out no more Money, I pull out my Inkhorn, and grow witty again. <HI>N. B.</HI> For three Weeks pa&s;t, I have been a Wit without Interrup|tion.</P>
<P>I appeal to you, dear Doctor, whe|ther the Ca&s;e, which I have been here de&s;cribing, was not once yours, while your Circum&s;tances were yet but lean, and your Pur&s;e <HI>Grey-Hound-gutted.</HI></P>
<P>I was therefore not a little &s;urpriz'd to find you writing, in Spight of your Gold and your Deanary. I at fir&s;t imagin'd there might be a general Famine in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and that you were reduc'd to dine upon your Wit again; but the Mirth and Fe&s;ti|vity of your Book reliev'd me in|&s;tantly from all Apprehen&s;ion of this Kind, and I have &s;ince con&s;ider'd you as only venting your Spleen again&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="8">
a Piece of ful&s;ome Roguery, which continues &s;till to go on in &s;hamele&s;s Luxuriancy.</P>
<P>Generally &s;peaking, you can as ea|&s;ily grope out Colour and Complex|tion with your Fingers, and pore into the Nature of Harmony with your Eyes, as di&s;cover the Characters of Great Per&s;ons in the De&s;criptions which are made of them in Dedicati|ons.</P>
<P>Your <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> upon that Subject was certainly very u&s;eful and &s;ea&s;ona|ble; and I think you are own'd to have executed it with ju&s;t Wit and Severity.</P>
<P>Will the Quality never &s;ee, that in the&s;e Panegyricks which Authors <HI>&s;ell</HI> them, they are fir&s;t bely'd and then cheated? The Language, in mo&s;t of tho&s;e Ca&s;es, is in Truth no other than this&mdash;<HI>My Lord, give me 20 Guineas and I will deceive you.</HI> Every Man who is deck'd in a Character which does not become him, is &s;o far dre&s;s'd in a Fool's Coat and Cap, and expos'd to the Grin and Contempt of
<PB N="11" REF="9">
all that can &s;ee it, that is, every Body but him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Fame is a fleeting tender Thing, and even where it is due, it is lo&s;t or cor|rupted when be&s;tow'd by improper or mercenary Hands.</P>
<P>I knew a pretty young Girl in a Country Village, who, over-fond of her own Prai&s;e, became a Property to a poor Rogue in the Pari&s;h, who was ignorant of all Things but <HI>Fawning.</HI> This Fellow us'd to wait on Mrs. <HI>Betty</HI> every Morning, and &s;he being a Shop|keeper, his u&s;ual Salutation was, <HI>Lord love your Heart, Mrs.</HI> Betty, <HI>you be main hand&s;ome, will you give me a Pipe of Tobacco? Am I,</HI> I&s;aac? (an&s;wers Mrs. <HI>Betty</HI>) <HI>let me &s;ee your Box;</HI> and then &s;he fills it. Thus <HI>I&s;aac</HI> extolls her out of a Quartern of <HI>Cut and Dry</HI> eve|ry Day &s;he lives; and tho' the young Woman is really hand&s;ome, &s;he and her Beauty are become a By-word, and, all the Country round, &s;he is call'd nothing but <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s <HI>Be&s;t Virginia.</HI></P>
<P>There is but one Way of carrying Flattery to a greater Height than it is
<PB N="12" REF="10">
already arriv'd to. All Patrons have been, Time out of Mind, <HI>perfectly</HI> wi&s;e, <HI>perfectly</HI> ju&s;t, <HI>perfectly</HI> valiant, <HI>perfectly</HI> witty, and <HI>perfectly</HI> beautiful; all Pa|trons are &s;o, becau&s;e all Authors have &s;aid &s;o. Now what remains to be done for the Improvement of Flatte|ry? even this: Let the Poet buckle him&s;elf in Armour, and, mounting a mettl'd Steed, &s;ally forth into the Streets and Highways, and challenge to &s;ingle Combat any bold Varlet who dare a&s;&s;ert that all the re&s;t of the World are, in the lea&s;t Degree, com|parable for Virtue, and Beauty, and all that, to one &s;ingle Lord or Lady, who is, perhaps, <HI>if known,</HI> de&s;pis'd by all the re&s;t of the World.</P>
<P>I expect the Thanks of our Au|thors for this Hint of mine, which yet I have borrow'd from them&s;elves. Con&s;idering what &s;everal of them have threaten'd long ago, and do, up|on Occa&s;ion, &s;till threaten, I have waited a good while to &s;ee them gra&s;p the Lance, and fall into the imme|diate Practice of this Piece of Author-Errantry, after having mo&s;t humbly
<PB N="13" REF="11">
invok'd his Grace, or her Lady&s;hip, to be propitious, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Says one Author,</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">&mdash;<HI>I know, Sir, your Mode&s;ty will be tortur'd by what I have here a&s;&s;ert|ed, but I am re&s;olv'd to maintain my Point to the la&s;t Drop of my Pen.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This Author, I doubt, carry'd his <HI>Quixoti&s;m</HI> too far; he threatens to attack the <HI>noble Squire</HI> him&s;elf, in De|fence of the <HI>noble Squire</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Another runs his Head again&s;t the Univer&s;e, in Behalf of his Lord and Patron, and cries,</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>My Lord,</P><P><HI>In Spight of the Growlings of an en|vious World, I will maintain it, in the Face of Mankind, that your Lord&s;hip is, in all Re&s;pects, the Only</HI> mo&s;t&mdash;<HI>and</HI> mo&s;t&mdash;<HI>and</HI> mo&s;t&mdash;<HI>and</HI> mo&s;t&mdash;<HI>and</HI> mo&s;t&mdash;</P></Q></P>
<P>He goes on in telling a great ma|ny <HI>more</HI> Lies, which I do not care to repeat: You &s;ee he makes a Curr
<PB N="14" REF="12">
of the Univer&s;e, and &s;ets it a-grow|ling at <HI>my Lord,</HI> who is a much greater Man than Mr. Univer&s;e him&s;elf: And then he threatens to run Mankind through the Body, if they do not own with him, that <HI>my Lord</HI> is, in <HI>all Re&s;pects,</HI> the &s;weete&s;t Creature in the three Pari&s;hes.</P>
<P>A Third boldly pronounces,</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">&mdash;<HI>This Character, which I have drawn of your Grace I will &s;tand by, and &s;upport, while I have Life or Limb.</HI></Q> This was a She-Author, and whether by her <HI>&s;upporting</HI> and her <HI>Limbs,</HI> &s;he did not mean bawdy, I am not &s;ure: But I think the Meaning of the next is plain, when &s;he tells her <HI>youthful Peer,</HI> that <Q><HI>Though he had committed &s;ufficient Ravages among the Sex, yet the Love|line&s;s of his Looks, and the</HI> Firmne&s;s of his Make, <HI>made her conclude he was but beginning.</HI></Q></P>
<P>In this Manner it is that you Po|ets and Par&s;ons <HI>create</HI> Gods, and <HI>in|vent</HI> Religions, and then force us, that
<PB N="15" REF="13">
are but Laymen and Readers, to wor|&s;hip the one, and &s;ubmit to the other, on Pain of being damn'd and knock'd down.</P>
<P>And it is mo&s;t natural, in the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s of Fal&s;hood and Forgery, for tho&s;e that have an Intere&s;t in their Maintainance, to appear, as much as is po&s;&s;ible, in great Earne&s;t; and, in Order to it, to puni&s;h and inveigh again&s;t all that dare &s;ee &s;o well as to di&s;tingui&s;h the mon&s;trous Features and Deformities of your Deities and Do|ctrines.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e now I cannot, with all my <HI>Opticks</HI> perceive, that the Eyes of a <HI>certain Earl</HI> are &s;o very brillant, or, that the Ceremonies of a <HI>certain Church</HI> are &s;o very decent; you mu&s;t, to be con&s;i&s;tent with your &s;elves, and of Importance with the <HI>Multitude,</HI> cen&s;ure and de&s;troy me, for being an ob|&s;tinate Enemy to the <HI>Church</HI> and the <HI>Earl;</HI> for &s;hould the People, by hear|ing my Rea&s;ons, come to embrace my Opinions, it might be my Turn next to direct and govern <HI>your &s;eeing</HI> and <HI>your believing.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="14">
I &s;hould not, dear Doctor, have fal|len into the&s;e Reflections <HI>here,</HI> had it not come &s;uddenly into my Mind, that they are not unlike tho&s;e I have heard you make formerly, before you were <HI>convinc'd</HI> and <HI>converted</HI> by a <HI>Deanary.</HI></P>
<P>Some have wonder'd how Doctor <HI>Swift,</HI> who&s;e Affection to the Church was never doubted, tho' his Chri&s;tia|nity was ever que&s;tion'd, &s;hould think the wor&s;e of &s;ome of the Clergy for their Trampling upon Loyalty and Oaths; and, for all his Reverence for the late Q&mdash; and her Coun&s;ellors, &s;hould make &s;uch honourable Mention of King <HI>George</HI> and his Mini&s;ters; but as it is well known you never were a Slave to Con&s;tancy and Prin|ciple, we can ea&s;ily account for this your Behaviour, and in Defence of it &s;ay, That in this In&s;tance, you have put off Prejudice, and re&s;um'd your Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, others alledge, that your Panegyrick is contradictory to your Banter upon <HI>Dedications:</HI> But this you have your &s;elf an&s;wer'd
<PB N="17" REF="15">
in your Preface to the fourth Editi|on, in which you have the following Lines.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'As to the <HI>Characters</HI> and <HI>In&s;cripti|ons</HI> at the End, I &s;till think them &s;o ju&s;t, that I am not like to repent of them; which may &s;erve to &s;hew me as much a Friend to well-grounded Panegyrick, as I ever &s;hall be a Foe to all fal&s;e Colouring. There is no &s;uch Thing as Prai&s;e and Blame, where they are not apply'd; and as I take upon me to expo&s;e the one, I think I need a&s;k no Pardon for at|tempting to practice the other.'</Q></P>
<P>It remains now for me to entertain you with &s;ome Remarks on the pre|&s;ent State of this Town, which no Man knew &s;ome Years ago better than your &s;elf.</P>
<P>And to begin with that which, with Gentlemen of your Faculty, <HI>claims Precedence</HI> of the King him&s;elf, the GOOD CHURCH of <HI>ENGLAND,</HI> I am &s;orry to tell you, &s;he is in the &s;ame puny, <HI>complaining</HI> Condition, which you, Mr. Dean, left her in; and lan|gui&s;hes
<PB N="18" REF="16">
&s;o immoderately, that if &s;he do not very &s;hortly kick up her <HI>reverend</HI> Heel, and depart this <HI>e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd</HI> Life, your Brethren, the <HI>Par|&s;ons,</HI> are <HI>fal&s;e Prophets;</HI> for they have not only, <HI>with one Mouth,</HI> predicted her Downfal the&s;e thirty Years, but are, <HI>at this very Juncture,</HI> preaching the <HI>paralytick old Lady's Funeral-Ora|tion</HI> every Sunday that pa&s;&s;es: So that if &s;he be not already &s;tone-dead, there's no believing the Ca&s;&s;ock.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spreading of Reports</HI> that the King is <HI>in Danger,</HI> or dead, is gene|rally, if not always, taken as a <HI>Mark of Di&s;affection,</HI> and as &s;uch puni&s;hable. If the forging of Tales concerning the <HI>Danger of the Church</HI> may be judg'd by the like Rule, I doubt mo&s;t of her <HI>pious Sons</HI> will be found <HI>er|rant Ba&s;tards.</HI></P>
<P>The pre&s;ent <HI>Tottering State</HI> of that <HI>Venerable Matron,</HI> proceeds from the <HI>dreadful Power</HI> which a <HI>new Act</HI> of Parliament gives to <HI>old Women</HI> to teach Children to read. From hence it is orthodoxly concluded, that the &s;aid <HI>old Women</HI> will, like <HI>Giants</HI> and
<PB N="19" REF="17">
Generals, head an <HI>Army of Infants,</HI> arm'd with P&s;alters and Horn-books, again&s;t the <HI>Hierarchy.</HI> Add to all this another <HI>terrible Circum&s;tance;</HI> a Man may <HI>now</HI> venture to hear. <HI>Tom Bradbury</HI> without being ruin'd by the <HI>Forfeiture</HI> of his <HI>Place,</HI> and the <HI>neg|lected Prie&s;thood</HI> can have <HI>no other</HI> Ven|geance upon &s;uch a <HI>Delinquent,</HI> but barely CURSING him.</P>
<P>A Quaker in <HI>Kent,</HI> when he was pre&s;s'd by a zealous Tory to conform to the <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h'd Church,</HI> made this <HI>rogui&s;h, rea&s;onable</HI> An&s;wer, <HI>Friend, thee may'&s;t &s;pare thy Breath and Per|&s;wa&s;ion; I will never be of that CHURCH which is always in Dan|ger:</HI> And &s;ome People, as arch and <HI>athei&s;tical</HI> as our Quaker, are ready to tell you, that neither their Prin|ciples nor <HI>their No&s;es</HI> will allow them to communicate with a <HI>Church,</HI> which, if our <HI>late&s;t Advices</HI> from the <HI>Pulpit be true,</HI> is already <HI>&s;tinking</HI> in her <HI>Sepulchre.</HI></P>
<P>The Right Reverend and right learned Lord Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> dif|fers from many of his Clergy upon
<PB N="20" REF="18">
this Head, and &s;eems of Opinion, that the <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h'd Church</HI> has &s;till <HI>&s;ome</HI> Exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>This <HI>orthodox, primitive</HI> Bi&s;hop has lately writ a <HI>per&s;picuous</HI> and <HI>per&s;wa|&s;ive</HI> Epi&s;tle to the Prie&s;ts of his Dio|ce&s;e, and in it warns them, with a paternal Tenderne&s;s, again&s;t the <HI>new</HI> Doxologies of <HI>ancient Hereticks.</HI> Be&s;ides, he tells them, that if they neglect their <HI>Duty to God and the King,</HI> they are liable to pay five Pounds; and his Lord&s;hip, no doubt, knew what Arguments were like to be of mo&s;t Force with <HI>them.</HI></P>
<P>We have had lately two new Plays; one is, Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> a Tragedy: It is acted with good Ap|plau&s;e at the <HI>New Hou&s;e,</HI> its own native Worth hiding, in a good Degree, the In&s;ufficiency of &s;ome of the Actors. You will find in it many beautiful Thoughts and Lines.</P>
<P>The other is a new Play of an <HI>ancient Poet;</HI> it is call'd, <HI>The Ma&s;que|rade,</HI> and acted in <HI>Drury-Lane:</HI> It
<PB N="21" REF="19">
fill'd the Hou&s;e a few Nights with People and Hi&s;&s;ing; but that Theatre never fails having a large Audience, tho' they act <HI>Charles John&s;on</HI> or <HI>Tom Thumb.</HI></P>
<P>This Winter has produc'd but few Pamphlets which the Town has vouch&s;afed to &s;mile on. You know, to be &s;ure, what Acceptance <HI>your</HI> E&s;&s;ay upon Dedications has met with; and there is an Apology for Par&s;on <HI>Alberoni,</HI> which has already run to the <HI>ninth Edition.</HI> This little Book is &s;uch a Thorn in the Sides of the Clergy, that it is every where taken for granted you are the Author of it. So that you are this Year, as you u&s;ed to be, at the Head of all the Pamphleteers in <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>I am ju&s;t now told, that the Right Honourable the <HI>Players</HI> and <HI>Privy Coun&s;ellors</HI> in the <HI>Old Hou&s;e,</HI> have found out that they are a <HI>Mini&s;try within them&s;elves,</HI> and have notify'd the &s;ame, <HI>in Form,</HI> to my <HI>Lord Cham|berlain,</HI> by the Mouth of their <HI>Plenipo</HI> and <HI>Copyer in Chief,</HI> the well bred Mr. <HI>Colley Cibber:</HI> But, I hear, <HI>his Grace</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="20">
frowns upon the&s;e <HI>Actors of State,</HI> and is almo&s;t provok'd to &s;hut up <HI>their Palace,</HI> becau&s;e they were &s;aucy to him, <HI>and pleaded their Patent for it.</HI></P>
<P>Vice and Dulne&s;s, <HI>Dear Doctor,</HI> ne|ver reign'd more irre&s;i&s;tibly, than they do at the very Time of the <HI>&s;igning and &s;ealing hereof.</HI> Our Wits leave us in Pairs; <HI>Grath</HI> and <HI>Row</HI> are ju&s;t gone, and others, of <HI>their Spirit and Genius,</HI> are in a fair Way to fol|low them; but Debauchery, <HI>Beaus,</HI> and In&s;olence, gather Ground and Numbers. For my Part, I cannot help fore&s;eeing and dreading the Day, when it will be as unfa&s;hionable to be Wit|ty, as 'tis now to be Good-natur'd or Sober.</P>
