<P>APOLOGIES, for the liberties we take with individuals, when the inte|re&s;ts of all mankind are at &s;take, are as frivolous as they are impertinent.

<P>THE extraordinary demand, for the <HI>Appendix</HI> to the third volume of the <HI>London</HI> Review, in which a <HI>&s;light &s;ketch</HI> of the fol|lowing <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> was fir&s;t printed, hav|ing &s;ugge&s;ted to the author that their re|publication, in a more commodious form, would be acceptable to the Public, he was led to a more con&s;iderate revi&s;al of the tract, which gave ri&s;e to them. The &s;lips and inadvertencies, which appeared, on &s;uch revi&s;al, to have e&s;caped him in the hurry of compo&s;ition, acquiring con|&s;equence from the importance of the &s;ub|ject, urged al&s;o a kind of nece&s;&s;ity for &s;uch republication.</P>
<P>The de&s;ire of atoning, for the defects of that ha&s;ty critique, induced him, there|fore, to enlarge on the more intere&s;ting parts of the <HI>View,</HI> and to dige&s;t the whole of his <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> on it, into a more me|thodical and regular form.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="6">The <HI>Ob&s;erver</HI> was the more readily in|duced to this, by an apparent deficiency of method in Mr. Jenyns's tract; though profe&s;&s;edly calculated for the peru&s;al of "the <HI>Bu&s;y</HI> and the <HI>Idle,"</HI> who may be comprized under tho&s;e who have but little time to read, and tho&s;e who read but little at a time; for who&s;e convenience, therefore, the matter is here &s;o managed, by a proper &s;ubdivi&s;ion of the &s;ubject, that the reader, be he as <HI>bu&s;y</HI> or as <HI>idle</HI> as he will, may take up or lay down the book at plea&s;ure, without running any ri&s;k of lo&s;ing, without recovery, the thread of its argument.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON A VIEW Of THE INTERNAL EVIDENCE OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>On the &s;ubject, &s;cope, and de&s;ign of the writer's argument in general, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>To prove the <HI>truth,</HI> by demon|&s;trating the <HI>divine origin,</HI> of the Chri&s;tian Religion,</Q>&mdash;The mo&s;t convincing proofs pretended to, amount but to a mere probability.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AMONG the many attempts, to recommend and accommodate the pro|found my&s;teries of <HI>divine wi&s;dom</HI> to the &s;hallow comprehen&s;ion of the <HI>human under&s;tanding,</HI> the pre&s;ent is by no means the lea&s;t promi&s;ing or plau&s;ible.
<PB N="2" REF="14">
But the <HI>Impo&s;&s;ible,</HI> nece&s;&s;arily includes the <HI>Impracticable,</HI> and all attempts, to reconcile objects, that are in their very e&s;&s;ence irreconcileable, mu&s;t ever be ineffectual.
<Q><L>In pride, in <HI>rea&s;oning</HI> pride, our errour lies;</L>
<L>All quit their &s;phere and ru&s;h into the &s;kies:</L>
<L>A&s;piring to be gods if angels fell,</L>
<L>A&s;piring to be angels, men rebel.</L></Q></P>
<P>Hence nothing can be more repre|hen&s;ible, than the arrogance of our modern <HI>Rationali&s;ts,</HI> in cavilling at e|very thing in <HI>Revelation,</HI> that is not reconcileable to <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> and in deny|ing every thing to be <HI>religious</HI> that is not <HI>rational.</HI> Tenacious of the <HI>name</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> as they are of the <HI>prin|ciples</HI> of <HI>Heathens,</HI> they want to new|model the &s;y&s;tem of <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> by ex|punging all tho&s;e doctrines, which they cannot reconcile to their new|&s;angled &s;cheme of <HI>Rationality.</HI> But,
<PB N="3" REF="15">
alas! their rea&s;oning faculties are too confined, to &s;oar above
<Q>&mdash;this vi&s;ible, diurnal &s;phere;</Q>
&s;o that, after all, they mu&s;t &s;it down content with a religion, which entitles them to no better an appellation than that of hone&s;t heathens, or give up even their <HI>nominal</HI> title to Chri&s;tia|nity, and hone&s;tly confe&s;s them&s;elves real <HI>Infidels.</HI></P>
<P>Let them <HI>chu&s;e;</HI> but the time &s;eems to be approaching when they mu&s;t make their choice. The Chri&s;tian world is no longer to be deceived by the&s;e wolves in &s;heep's cloathing; the&s;e believers in the <HI>name</HI> of a <HI>Saviour,</HI> who&s;e <HI>power</HI> of <HI>&s;alvation</HI> they openly deny.</P>
<P>There is &s;o much di&s;ingenuou&s;ne&s;s and &s;ophi&s;try in the practices of the&s;e <HI>minute philo&s;ophers,</HI> that we are particu|larly &s;orry to &s;ee them kept in coun|tenance by the mi&s;applied abilities of
<PB N="4" REF="16">
more ingenious and ingenuous writers.</P>
<P>It has, indeed, been publicly hint|ed, that this little work is a mere con|trover&s;ial bubble, blown up to amu&s;e well-meaning Chri&s;tians, in order to impo&s;e on their credulity, and rai&s;e a &s;neer at the expence of their &s;implicity and &s;incerity.</P>
<P>For our own part, we have a better opinion of the author, than to give credit to &s;uch a &s;ugge&s;tion. His rank and reputation in life, as well as in literature, forbid our entertaining a thought &s;o derogatory to his charac|ter, as a man of &s;en&s;e, honour, and probity. For his <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> it is true, we have hitherto given him <HI>credit;</HI> but, as he now profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf reli|giou&s;ly &s;olvent, we &s;hall take the li|berty of inve&s;tigating the terms of pay|ment, by a particular and impartial re|view of his pre&s;ent performance.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="17">Before we begin this inve&s;tigation, however, it may not be ami&s;s to enter a caveat, again&s;t the reader's giving cre|dit to the argument merely on the au|thority of the writer. The good faith of the latter, re&s;pects him&s;elf alone, the validity of his, rea&s;oning only re|&s;pects the reader.</P>
<P>Should his work, he &s;ays, ever have the honour to be admitted into &s;uch good company as the <HI>bu&s;y</HI> or the <HI>idle,</HI> they will immediately determine it to be that of &s;ome enthu&s;ia&s;t or me|thodi&s;t, &s;on beggar, or &s;ome madman. "I &s;hall, therefore," &s;ays he, <Q>beg leave to a&s;&s;ure them, that the au|thor is very far removed from all the&s;e characters: that he <HI>once perhaps believed as little as them&s;elves,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This intimation of our author's, puts us in mind of old <HI>Gre&s;&s;et,</HI> one of the <HI>beaux|e&s;prits, e&s;prits,</HI> and, as he long affected to be thought the <HI>e&s;prits-forts</HI> of France, having outlived his <HI>pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> and almo&s;t his <HI>vanity,</HI> (which is &s;aying a great deal of a Frenchman) he re|tired in di&s;gu&s;t to a mona&s;tery, and turned enthu&s;ia&s;t; alledging, as the &s;tronge&s;t proof of the propriety of his new creed, the im|propriety of his former infidelity.&mdash;</NOTE> but
<PB N="6" REF="18">
having &s;ome lei&s;ure and more curio|&s;ity, he employed them both in re|&s;olving a que&s;tion which &s;eemed to him of &s;ome importance, &mdash;Whe|ther Chri&s;tianity was really an im|po&s;ture founded on an ab&s;urd, incre|dible, and ob&s;olete fable, as many &s;uppo&s;e it? Or whether it is, what it pretends to be, a revelation com|municated to mankind by the in|terpo&s;ition of &s;upernatural power? On a candid enquiry, he &s;oon found, that the fir&s;t was an ab&s;olute impo&s;|&s;ibility, and that its preten&s;ions to
<PB N="7" REF="19">
the latter were founded on the mo&s;t &s;olid grounds: In the further pur|&s;uit of his examination, he perceived, at every &s;tep, new lights ari&s;ing, and &s;ome of the brighte&s;t from parts, of it the mo&s;t ob&s;cure, but productive of the cleare&s;t proofs, becau&s;e equally beyond the power of human artifice to invent, and human rea&s;on to di&s;|cover.</Q></P>
<P>That the <HI>brighte&s;t lights,</HI> and <HI>cleare&s;t proofs</HI> Should ari&s;e from the <HI>mo&s;t ob&s;cure</HI> parts of &s;cripture, is as &s;ingular as is the rea&s;on given for it; viz.<Q>be|cau&s;e they are beyond the power of human artifice to invent, and human rea&s;on to di&s;cover.</Q> But, may we not a&s;k here, how our author could a&s;|&s;ign &s;o notable a rea&s;on, without hav|ing him&s;elf, carried human <HI>artifice</HI> and human <HI>rea&s;on</HI> to their utmo&s;t extent of <HI>di&s;covery</HI> and <HI>invention?</HI> How el&s;e
<PB N="8" REF="20">
&s;hould he find this di&s;covery and in|vention to be an <HI>ab&s;olute impo&s;&s;ibility?</HI> &mdash;If, indeed, he meant to infinuate that he hath carried the powers of in|ve&s;tigation &s;o far as <HI>this;</HI> well and good! The improvements of <HI>art,</HI> the <HI>progre&s;s</HI> of <HI>&s;cience,</HI> are at an end!&mdash; But we mu&s;t have &s;tronger proof of the fact than a mere ip&s;e-dixit, in a matter of &s;o much importance.</P>
<P>That it is of con&s;equence to the rea|der to know, that the author is not an <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;t</HI> or a <HI>madman,</HI> we admit; but why we are told he is not a <HI>me|thodi&s;t</HI> or a <HI>beggar</HI> we do not readily conceive. Is any doctrine the le&s;s true becau&s;e it is taught by a methodi&s;t? Is any argument the le&s;s valid becau&s;e it is urged by a beggar? Or would the &s;ame doctrine be more true if main|tained by a metropolitan? Or the &s;ame argument more valid if urged
<PB N="9" REF="21">
by a Nabob?&mdash;Our Saviour and his apo&s;tles were men of eminence neither in church nor &s;tate. They were nei|ther high-prie&s;ts nor lords of trade; nei|ther men of credit nor men of fortune. Nor do we &s;ee any incongruity in a very credible man's being a methodi&s;t and a very &s;ound rea&s;oner's being as poor as Job.</P>
<P>It is more to the purpo&s;e that we are told, the author is <HI>not</HI> an <HI>enthu|&s;ia&s;t</HI> or a madman. But who tells us this?&mdash;The very man him&s;elf.&mdash;And who ever took a man's own word for his not being in a &s;tate of in&s;anity or intoxication?&mdash;"I drunk!" &s;ays drun|ken Ca&s;&s;io in the play, <Q>No, Sir, &mdash; This is my right hand and this is my left</Q>&mdash;at the &s;ame time mi&s;ta|king one for the other.</P>
<P>We do not &s;ay, this is actually the ca&s;e with our author; but, we &s;ay,
<PB N="10" REF="22">
that his own a&s;&s;everation merely cannot be admitted as evidence to the contra|ry.

From doubting and di&s;believing what is pro|bably true, they affect to believe what is palpably fal&s;e. Nay, from denying almo&s;t every thing, they come really to believe almo&s;t any thing.</P>
<P><HI>New Converts,</HI> we &s;ay, are apt, thro' inordinate zeal, to give into exce&s;s of credulity: a conduct, which, howe|ver pious, certainly borders on En|thu&s;ia&s;m. Indeed, we cannot help thinking our author betrays a <HI>little tincture</HI> of it in his paradoxical ob&s;er|vation, re&s;pecting Divine Revelation in general; when, he &s;ays, all circum|&s;tances con&s;idered, <Q>if it were in eve|ry

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN proof of this <HI>third</HI> propo&s;ition, our author begins by making a di&s;tinc|tion, between the moral precepts of Chri&s;tianity (founded, as he ob&s;erves, on rea&s;on) and tho&s;e precepts, which, being founded on fal&s;e principles, in|culcate in fact no virtues at all. Un|der the former he includes piety to God, benevolence to man, ju&s;tice, cha|rity, temperance and &s;obriety, with all tho&s;e which prohibit the contrary vices, and all that deba&s;e our natures, and, by mutual injuries, introduce univer&s;al di&s;order, and con&s;equently univer&s;al mi&s;ery. Under the latter he
<PB N="46" REF="58">
cla&s;&s;es tho&s;e fictitious virtues, which, he &s;ays, produce no &s;alutary effects; and however admired, are no virtues at all, &s;uch as <HI>Valour, Patrioti&s;m</HI> and <HI>Friend&s;hip.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Monthly</HI> Reviewers, in their critique on our author's work, ob|&s;erve, on this di&s;tinction, that they <Q>never conceived that the virtues of <HI>friend&s;hip, fortitude,</HI> and <HI>patrioti&s;m,</HI> do not form a part of the <HI>moral &s;y&s;tem</HI> of the <HI>go&s;pel:</HI> much le&s;s could they have urged the want of the&s;e vir|tues as a peculiar recommendation of its excellence. They are con&s;pi|cuou&s;ly illu&s;trated," &s;ay they, "in the character of its author, and it would be ea&s;y to produce &s;triking in&s;tances in which his courage and friend&s;hip, and concern for the wel|fare of his country, were actually di&s;played. But this is needle&s;s; the
<PB N="47" REF="59">
advocates of the Chri&s;tian religion, in an&s;wer to Lord Shafte&s;bury and others, have &s;ufficiently vindicated it in this re&s;pect. <HI>The&s;e</HI> are unque&s;tion|ably virtues of con&s;iderable impor|tance; and &s;o far as they do not in|terfere with the general principles of benevolence which Chri&s;tianity in|culcates, they con&s;titute a part of <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> morality.</Q></P>
<P>It is well for the&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hing cri|tics that they bring in the <HI>&s;alvo,</HI> at the at the clo&s;e of the above paragraph, re&s;pecting the&s;e popular virtues <HI>not in|terfering</HI> with the general principles of benevolence, which Chri&s;tianity incul|cates.</P>
<P>This is the very point in que&s;tion; and, however &s;ucce&s;sfully the advocates for Chri&s;tianity may have combated Shaft&s;bury and others, there is &s;ome
<PB N="48" REF="60">
room &s;till left for oppo&s;ing our au|thor's argument.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Valour,</HI> &s;ays he, for in&s;tance, or active courage, is for the mo&s;t part con&s;titutional, and therefore can have no more claim to moral merit, than wit, beauty, health, &s;trength, or any other endowment of the mind or body; and &s;o far is it from pro|ducing any &s;alutary effects by intro|ducing peace, order, or happine&s;s into &s;ociety, that it is the u&s;ual per|petrator of all the violences, which from retaliated injuries di&s;tract the world with blood&s;hed and deva&s;ta|tion. It is the engine by which the &s;trong are enabled to plunder the weak, the proud to trample upon the humble, and the guilty to op|pre&s;s the innocent; it is the chief in&s;trument which Ambition em|ploys in her unju&s;t pur&s;uits of wealth
<PB N="49" REF="61">
and power, and is therefore &s;o much extolled by her votaries: it was in|deed congenial with the religion of pagans, who&s;e gods were for the mo&s;t part made out of decea&s;ed he|roes, exalted to heaven as a reward for the mi&s;chiefs which they had per|petrated upon earth, and therefore with them this was the fir&s;t of vir|tues, and had even engro&s;&s;ed that denomination to it&s;elf; but, what|ever merit it may have a&s;&s;umed a|mong pagans, with Chri&s;tians it can pretend to none.</Q></P>
<P>There would be &s;ome argument in all this, if, becau&s;e valour be the <HI>oc|ca&s;ional in&s;trument</HI> of oppre&s;&s;ion, it be al&s;o the <HI>nece&s;&s;ary cau&s;e</HI> of it; or if men were always <HI>mi&s;chievous</HI> in proportion as they are <HI>bold.</HI> But we pre&s;ume that this is not the ca&s;e; <HI>cruelty</HI> being <HI>characteri&s;tic</HI> of cowardice, and bene|volence
<PB N="50" REF="62">
of bravery. Per&s;onal valour may, therefore, be ju&s;tly e&s;teemed to have &s;ome moral merit; although, as it is allowed to be in a great degree con&s;titutional, it is certainly no farther to be deemed a moral virtue, than it is to be per&s;onally acquired. For a virtue, notwith&s;tanding the plau&s;ibility of our author's rea&s;oning, we pre&s;ume it may ju&s;tly be &s;tiled.</P>
<P>Our author, indeed, &s;ays, that few, or none are the occa&s;ions in which Chri&s;tians are permitted to exert their courage or valour. "They are &s;o far," &s;ays he, <Q>from being allowed to inflict evil, that they are forbid even to re&s;i&s;t it; they are &s;o far from being encouraged to revenge injuries, that one of their fir&s;t duties is to forgive them; &s;o far from being incited to de&s;troy their enemies, that they are commanded
<PB N="51" REF="63">
to love them, and to &s;erve them to the utmo&s;t of their power.</Q></P>
<P>Surely our author here mi&s;takes the nature of <HI>that evil</HI> which Chri&s;tians are forbid to re&s;i&s;t. It certainly is not the moral evil of <HI>inju&s;tice!</HI> Admitting they are not to <HI>revenge</HI> injuries, &s;urely they may exert their valour to <HI>prevent</HI> the execution of them! If not, a good Chri&s;tian mu&s;t not re&s;i&s;t the violence of a robber, a hou&s;e-breaker, or a murderer!</P>
<P>But, granting that individuals, anxi|ous to copy after Chri&s;tian perfection, are ju&s;tified in thus <HI>&s;ubmitting</HI> to (though it be in fact <HI>conniving</HI> at) the commi&s;|&s;ion of acts of inju&s;tice; valour may be yet a nece&s;&s;ary virtue to the &s;upport and defence of Chri&s;tian communities; as we &s;hail &s;hew, when we come to treat of <HI>Patrioti&s;m.</HI></P>
<P>But though our author will not ad|mit
<PB N="52" REF="64">
<HI>active courage</HI> to be a real virtue; <HI>pa&s;&s;ive courage,</HI> or fortitude, he allows to be con&s;i&s;tent with the pure&s;t Chri|&s;tian morality.</P>
<P><Q>Pa&s;&s;ive courage, &s;ays he, is frequent|ly, and properly inculcated by this meek and &s;uffering religion, under the titles of patience and re&s;ignation: a real and &s;ub&s;tantial virtue this, and a direct contra&s;t to the former; for pa&s;&s;ive courage ari&s;es from the noble&s;t di&s;po&s;itions of the human mind, from a contempt of misfor|tunes, pain, and death, and a con|fidence in the protection of the At|mighty; active from the meane&s;t: from pa&s;&s;ion, vanity, and &s;elf-de|pendence: pa&s;&s;ive courage is derived from a zeal for truth, and a per&s;eve|ranee in duty; active is the offspring of pride and revenge, and the parent of cruelty and inju&s;tice: in &s;hort;
<PB N="53" REF="65">
pa&s;&s;ive courage is the re&s;olutiot of a philo&s;opher, active the ferocity of a &s;avage. Nor is this more incompa|tible with the precepts, than with the object of this religion, which is the attainment of the kingdom of hea|ven; for valour is not that &s;ort of violence, by which that kingdom is to be taken; nor are the turbu|lent &s;pirits of heroes and conquerors admi&s;&s;ibleinto tho&s;e regions of peace, &s;ubordination, and tranquility.</Q></P>
<P>This is, on the whole, well &s;aid; though we cannot agree that va|lour or active courage is always the off|&s;pring of pride and revenge, or the parent of cruelty and inju&s;tice.&mdash;Pa&s;&s;ivecourage may, al&s;o, be ju&s;tly &s;tiled the <HI>re&s;olution</HI> of a <HI>philo&s;opher</HI> and yet active courage be very unju&s;tly called the <HI>ferocity</HI> of a <HI>&s;avage.</HI> Not but that the activity of
<PB N="54" REF="66">
&s;ome men is fierce and ferocious, as the pa&s;&s;ivene&s;s of others is tame and irre|&s;olute.</P>
<P>On <HI>Patrioti&s;m</HI> our author declaims thus:</P>
<P><Q><HI>Patrioti&s;m,</HI> that celebrated virtue &s;o much practi&s;ed in ancient, and &s;o much profe&s;&s;ed in modern times, that virtue, which &s;o long pre&s;erved the liberties of Greece, and exalted Rome to the empire of the world: this celebrated virtue, I &s;ay, mu&s;t al&s;o be excluded; becau&s;e it, not only falls &s;hort of, but directly counteracts, the exten&s;ive benevo|lence of this religion. A Chri&s;tian is of no country, he is a citizen of the world; and his neighbours and countrymen are the inhabitants of the remote&s;t regions, whenever their di&s;tre&s;&s;es demand his friendly a&s;&s;i&s;tance: Chri&s;tianity commands
<PB N="55" REF="67">
us to love all mankind, Patrioti&s;m to oppre&s;s all other countries to ad|vance the imaginary pro&s;perity of our own: Chri&s;tianity enjoins to imitate the univer&s;al benevolence of our Creator, who pours forth his ble&s;&s;ings on every nation upon earth; Patrioti&s;m to copy the mean partiality of an Engli&s;h pari&s;h-offi|cer, who thinks inju&s;tice and cruelty meritorious, whenever they pro|mote the intere&s;ts of his own incon|&s;iderable village. This has ever been a favourite virtue with mankind, be|cau&s;e it conceals &s;elf-intere&s;t under the ma&s;k of public &s;pirit, not only from others, but even from them &s;elves, and gives a licence to inflict wrongs and injuries mot only with impunity, but with applau&s;e; but it is &s;o diametrically oppo&s;ite to the great, characteri&s;tic of this in&s;titu|tion,

<P>Civil government, national policy, and the rights of war and peace, were &s;ubjects, indeed, that appear not to have come directly under his deci&s;ion.

<P><PB N="65" REF="77">In regard to the virtue of <HI>Friend|&s;hip,</HI> our author, either wilfully or negligently impo&s;es a change of terms upon us; rea&s;oning very inaccurately on the &s;ubject.&mdash;</P>
<P>"Friend&s;hip," &s;ays he, <Q>likewi&s;e, although more congenial to the prin|ciples of Chri&s;tianity ari&s;ing from more tender and amiable di&s;po&s;i|tions, could never gain admittance among&s;t her benevolent precepts for the &s;ame rea&s;on; becau&s;e it is too nar|row and confined, and appropriates that benevolence to a <HI>&s;ingle object,</HI> which is here commanded to be ex|tended over <HI>all:</HI> Where friend&s;hips ari&s;e from &s;imilarity of &s;entiments, and di&s;intere&s;ted affections, they are advantageous, agreeable, and inno|cent, but have little preten&s;ions to merit;</Q> for it is ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, <Q>if ye love them, which love you,

what thanks have ye? for &s;inners love tho&s;e, that love them. But if they are formed from alliances in parties, factions, and intere&s;ts, or from a participation of vices, the u|&s;ual parents of what are called friend|&s;hips among mankind, they are then both mi&s;chievous and criminal, and con&s;equently forbidden, but in their <HI>utmo&s;t purity</HI> de&s;erve no recommenda|tion from this religion.</Q></P>
<P>In reply, however, to what is here advanced on <HI>friend&s;hip</HI> and the text quoted from Luke in &s;upport of it, may be oppo&s;ed the precept inculcated in John xiii. 34. quoted al&s;o by our au|thor in favour of that Chri&s;tian virtue Charity: <Q>A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one ano|ther; as I have loved you, that ye al&s;o love one another; by this &s;hall all

men know that ye are my di&s;ciples, if ye have love one to another.</Q>&mdash; Here we &s;ee that brotherly-love, or mutual friend&s;hip (which in the former text is repre&s;ented as of little merit, being the virtue of &s;inners) is made the te&s;t, or criterion of chri&s;tianity, the virtue one &s;hould imaging characteri&s;tic of &s;aints.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tian charity, in its <HI>utmo&s;t extent</HI> is certainly &s;omething more than mere friend&s;hip; but we cannot help think|ing that reciprocal affection, or, as our author &s;tiles it, that "benevolent di&s;po&s;ition" which is here made the characteri&s;tic of Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples, the te&s;t of their obedience and the mark by which they are to be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, is too near a-kin to friend&s;hip, to admit of friend&s;hip's being with pro|priety di&s;carded as a fictitious virtue, or as no virtue at all.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="80">Our author, indeed, is far from rea|&s;oning accurately on this head. For, after depreciating, as above, the virtue &s;pecified, he tells us, he <Q>means not by this to pa&s;s any cen&s;ure on the principles of valour, patrioti&s;m and honour.</Q></P>
<P>The attentive reader will here ob|&s;erve that, in this re&s;pecification of the &s;purious or fal&s;e virtues, our au|thor hath &s;ub&s;tituted the term <HI>honour</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>friend&s;hip.</HI> The rea&s;on is, that, having changed his ground, he found <HI>that</HI> more pertinent to the &s;tate of his argument. Of that phantom modern <HI>honour,</HI> indeed, to which the mo&s;t &s;olid and &s;ub&s;tantial <HI>friend&s;hips</HI> are &s;ometimes &s;acrificed, he may &s;ay ju&s;tly, that <Q>a man, who makes this his ruling principle, however virtuous he may be, cannot be a Chri&s;tian, becau&s;e

<P>That the laws of &s;uch <HI>honour</HI> are in|compatible with the rules of Chri&s;tianity we readily allow, though we cannot allow that the &s;irme&s;t friend&s;hip for an individual is incompatible with that uni|ver&s;al philanthropy, which Chri&s;tianity inculcates for all mankind.

<PB N="72" REF="84">
to die as an atonement for the &s;ins of mankind. This was all that Chri&s;t required to be believed by tho&s;e who were willing to become his di&s;ciples: he, who does not be|lieve this, is not a Chri&s;tian, and he who does, believes the whole that is e&s;&s;ential to his profe&s;&s;ion, and all that is properly comprehended un|der the name of faith.</Q></P>
<P>We &s;ee here that, though our author &s;crupled at fir&s;t &s;etting out, to &s;ay what pure Chri&s;tianity was, he has reduced it, in this illu&s;tration of Faith, to what he calls a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> propo&s;ition. But he can|not be ignorant that this &s;ingle propo|&s;ition is &s;ufficiently multifarious and complicated.</P>
<P>He cannot be ignorant that the ex|pre&s;&s;ion, <HI>Son of God,</HI> is differently un|der&s;tood by different interpreters; that &s;ome think it con&s;i&s;tent with his being
<PB N="73" REF="85">
a mere man, while others think it ex|alts him to an equality with the Deity.</P>
<P>He cannot be ignorant that his atonement by death for the &s;ins of mankind, is controverted and even boldly denied by a con&s;iderable num|ber of profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>To what purpo&s;e is it that our au|thor tells us this propo&s;ition is the e&s;|&s;ential creed of a Chri&s;tian, if other writers of equal authority tell us otherwi&s;e. Nay to what purpo&s;e is it, we are told that the &s;ame propo&s;i|tion is to be found in the Scriptures, who&s;e truth we admit, if they are li|able to various interpretation?</P>
<P>It is in vain to &s;ay, that "when we are once convinced the Scriptures are of divine original, we have nothing more to do but implicitly believe what they tell us." How many thou|&s;and volumes of controver&s;y have
<PB N="74" REF="86">
there not been written to determine what they do tell us! And is it not &s;till left as indeterminate as ever.</P>
<P>Granting that implicit faith in di|vine revelation be our duty; by what means are we to trace from the <HI>hi&s;tory</HI> of that revelation, what is really re|vealed? Surely it mu&s;t be by the &s;ame means as tho&s;e by which we become convinced of its divine original! And if rea&s;on be competent in the one ca&s;e, it &s;urely mu&s;t be &s;o in the other.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, if the operation of <HI>grace</HI> be nece&s;&s;ary to impre&s;s the true &s;en&s;e and meaning of the &s;crip|tures on the mind and heart of the un|converted &s;inner, why &s;hould it be le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary, as it is evidently equally expedient, to convince him of the di|vine origin of revelation in general?&mdash; We firmly believe that, admitting the reality of our author's conver&s;ion to
<PB N="75" REF="87">
Chri&s;tianity (of which we have no rea&s;on to doubt) he is much more indebted for it to the efficacious and irre&s;i&s;tible impul&s;e of divine grace, than to all the pains he has taken, and the inge|nuity he has exerted, in inve&s;tigating the moral proofs of its divine in&s;titu|tion.</P>
<P>But we &s;hall in this &s;ection confine our&s;elves, in conformity to the au|thor's method, to the con&s;ideration of Faith merely as a Chri&s;tian duty. The objects of that Faith, with the nature of it, we &s;hall di&s;cu&s;s more particu|larly hereafter.</P>
<P>"Faith," &s;ays he, <Q>cannot be alto|gether void of moral merit, (as &s;ome would repre&s;ent it) becau&s;e it is in a degree voluntary; for daily experience &s;hews us, that men not only pretend to, but actually do be|lieve, and di&s;believe almo&s;t any
<PB N="76" REF="88">
propo&s;itions, which be&s;t &s;uits their intere&s;ts, or inclinations, and un|feignedly change their &s;incere opi|nions with their &s;ituations and cir|cum&s;tances. For we have power over the mind's eye, as well as over the body's, to &s;hut it again&s;t the &s;tronge&s;t rays of truth and religion, whenever they become painful to us, and to open it again to the faint glimmerings of &s;ceptici&s;m and infi|delity</Q> when we <Q>love darkne&s;s ra|ther than light, becau&s;e our deeds are evil.</Q> And this, I think, &s;uffi|ciently <Q>refutes all objections to the moral nature of faith, drawn from the &s;uppo&s;ition or its being quite in|voluntary and nece&s;&s;arily dependent on the degree of evidence, which is offered to our under&s;tandings.</Q></P>
<P>We cannot pretend to call in que|&s;tion the ductility of our author's <HI>believing
<PB N="77" REF="89">
organs,</HI> or the power he has over them to enable him to believe what he plea&s;es. But, we mu&s;t own, with regard to our&s;elves, we &s;hould be happy to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch power of credulity; &s;o as to be able to be|lieve every thing to be true which be&s;t &s;uits our intere&s;ts, inclinations, and circum&s;tances; even though we &s;hould thence be &s;ubject to be &s;ometimes di&s;|agreeably undeceived. We &s;hould get rid of many irk&s;ome reflections and enjoy many a happy hour, at the ha|zard only of being di&s;turbed from our plea&s;ing reveries, and exclaiming with the interrupted vi&s;ionary;
<Q>Pol, me occidi&s;tis, amici, Non &s;erva&s;tis <HI>ait;</HI> cui &s;ic extorta voluptas, Et demtus per vim mentis grati&s;&s;imus error.</Q></P>
<P>As it is, we do not perceive our|&s;elves, e&s;pecially ju&s;t at pre&s;ent, a whit more di&s;po&s;ed to believe, than to doubt
<PB N="78" REF="90">
the reality of what we wi&s;h to be true. We do not think the ob&s;ervation holds good, at lea&s;t &s;o generally, or in the degree here &s;uppo&s;ed. The bold and &s;anguine, indeed, are apt to anti|cipate their wi&s;hes; but the timid and &s;aturnine are as apt to procra&s;tinate even their ju&s;t expectations. It is as natural for the one to be confident as for the other to be dubious; nay, per|&s;ons of the &s;ame con&s;titution are not always in the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition or mood either of doubt or credulity.</P>
<P>That there is &s;ome truth, however, in the rule, with re&s;pect to its general application, is probable; as faith or facility of Belief is frequently and &s;trongly recommended in the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>But by the faith or ea&s;ine&s;s of belief, inculcated in the go&s;pel, can &s;urely be meant nothing more than the <HI>pious a&s;&s;ent</HI> and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive acquie&s;cence of
<PB N="79" REF="91">
human rea&s;on to its my&s;terious and in|comprehen&s;ible doctrines, agreeable to its go&s;pel &s;ignification mentioned above <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Meaning an humble, tractable, and candid di&s;po&s;ition, a tru&s;t in God, and con|fidence in his promi&s;es. See page 71.</NOTE>, and not that <HI>rational conviction,</HI> which ari&s;es from a clear comprehen|&s;ion of a propo&s;ition and the evident demon&s;tration of its truth. The fu|tility of recommending the latter kind of faith or facility of rational convic|tion, we think, is obvious.</P>
<P>Indeed we do not &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of demon&s;tration to produce &s;uch an a&s;&s;ent, as is here admitted to con&s;titute a <HI>Chri&s;tian's</HI> Faith. If &s;uch Faith be, as our author &s;ays, an act of the <HI>will</HI> as much as of the under&s;tanding, there are many inducements to &s;uch an act that fall far &s;hort of demon&s;tra|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="92">If it be, as he ob&s;erves, "well worth every man's while to believe Chri&s;tianity if he can," and &s;uch belief depends &s;o much on his will, one would think motives of &s;elf-intere&s;t alone would excite him to &s;hew that he could, in this ca&s;e, do as he would.</P>
<P>Is it not a &s;ufficient incitement, to faith in Chri&s;tianity, to re&s;&s;ect that "it is the &s;ure&s;t pre&s;ervative again&s;t vicious habits and their attendant evils, the be&s;t re&s;ource under di&s;tre&s;&s;es and di&s;appointments, ill health and ill fortune, and the firme&s;t ba&s;is on which contemplation can re&s;t?"&mdash;That "it is the only principle, which can retain men in a &s;teady and uniform cour&s;e of virtue, piety, and devotion, or can &s;upport them in the hour of di&s;tre&s;s, of &s;ickne&s;s and of death?"&mdash;</P>
<P>The <HI>word</HI> Faith, indeed, our author calls <HI>unfortunate:</HI> <Q>It has, &s;ays he,
<PB N="81" REF="93">
been &s;o tortured and &s;o mi&s;applied to mean every ab&s;urdity, which ar|tifice could impo&s;e upon ignorance, that it has lo&s;t all preten&s;ions to the title of virtue; but if brought back to the &s;implicity of its original &s;ig|nification, it well de&s;erves that name, becau&s;e it u&s;ually ari&s;es from the mo&s;t amiable di&s;po&s;itions, and is always a direct contra&s;t to pride, ob|&s;tinacy, and &s;elf-conceit. If taken in the exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e of an a&s;&s;ent to the evidence of things not &s;een, it comprehends the exi&s;tence of a God, and a future &s;tate, and is therefore not only it&s;elf a moral vir|tue, but the &s;ource from whence all others mu&s;t proceed; for on the be|lief of the&s;e <HI>all religion</HI> and <HI>morality</HI> mu&s;t <HI>intirely</HI> depend.</Q></P>
<P>Here again, we mu&s;t remind this writer of his having before admitted
<PB N="82" REF="94">
that men might be <HI>virtuous, hone&s;t</HI> and even <HI>religious</HI> men and yet <HI>not</HI> be <HI>Chri|&s;tians:</HI> whereas now he makes not only <HI>all religion,</HI> but <HI>all morality</HI> depend on Chri&s;tian Faith for its very exi&s;tence; &s;uch faith being here expre&s;sly de|clared not only in it&s;elf a moral virtue, but the &s;ource from whence all others mu&s;t proceed.</P>
<P><HI>Wits,</HI> they &s;ay, have &s;hort memo|ries; but, when they turn logicians, philo&s;ophers and divines, they &s;hould endeavour to extend their memory, and keep it on the &s;tretch, with the thread of their argument, from one end to the other.</P>
<P>On the whole, with re&s;pect to Faith, as a moral duty; there appears to us but very little argument nece&s;&s;ary to enforce it. If men can believe or even half-believe what they will, it is &s;o much their intere&s;t to do it in believing

the truths of Chri&s;tianity; the man mu&s;t be either a very great fool or a very great philo&s;opher indeed, who would remain one moment an Infidel.</P>
<P>If, as this writer declares; <HI>Faith</HI> be al&s;o the &s;ource from whence all other real virtues mu&s;t proceed, who would not be a Chri&s;tian in practice as well as theory, without waiting a moment for any rational proof of the internal evi|dence of Chri&s;tianity!</P>

<P>On the fourth or conclu&s;ive propo&s;ition. <Q>That &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of religion and morality could not po&s;&s;ibly have been the work of any man or &s;et of men: much le&s;s of tho&s;e ob&s;cure and illiterate per&s;ons, who actually did di&s;cover and publi&s;h it to the world; and that,
<PB N="84" REF="96">
therefore, it mu&s;t undoubtedly have been effected by the in|terpo&s;ition of divine power, that is, it mu&s;t derive its origin from God.</Q>&mdash;This propo&s;ition &s;hewn to contain only corollaries of the preceding propo&s;itions; and, though true as to fact, and therefore admitted <HI>ex gratia,</HI> &s;till problematical in argument.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THIS propo&s;ition, or rather two propo&s;itions united, our author gives, as corollaries to the three preceding; pre&s;uming they are &s;o conclu&s;ive as to amount to little &s;hort of demon&s;tra|tion. It is, indeed, founded, &s;ays he, <Q>on the very &s;ame rea&s;oning by which the <HI>material world</HI> is proved to be the work of his invi&s;ible hand. We view with admiration the heavens and the earth, and all therein con|tained; we contemplate with amaze|ment
<PB N="85" REF="97">
ment the minute bodies of animals too &s;mall for preception, and the immen&s;e planetary orbs too va&s;t for imagination: we are certain that the&s;e cannot be the works of man; and therefore we conclude with rea|&s;on, that they mu&s;t be the produc|tions of an omnipotent Creator.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In the &s;ame manner we &s;ee here a &s;cheme of religion and morality unlike and &s;uperior to all ideas of the human mind, equally impo&s;&s;ible to have been di&s;covered by the know|ledge, as invented by the artifice of man; and therefore by the very &s;ame mode of rea&s;oning, and with the &s;ame ju&s;tice, we conclude, that it mu&s;t derive its origin from the &s;ame omnipotent and omni&s;cient Being.</Q></P>
<P>With due deference to this inge|nious writer, this, like many other
<PB N="86" REF="98">
parts of his work, is rather declama|tory than argumentative. In contem|plating the works of creation, our wonder is excited and our admiration rai&s;ed, in proportion as human ge|nius is enabled to trace the marks of divine wi&s;dom in the Great Artificer.</P>
<P>The vulgar indeed may gape and &s;tare at what they cannot compre|hend; but how limited are their ideas, how low are their conceptions of the power and wi&s;dom of the Deity! Their wonder at the mo&s;t &s;tupendous in&s;tances of both, is like that of a child at the &s;queaking of a trumpet or the tinkling of a rattle.</P>
<P>The admiration of the ignorant in|deed is founded on their ignorance, that of the &s;cientific on their know|ledge. It is not from what we <HI>do not</HI> comprehend that we deduce the wi&s;|dom and power of the Creator, but
<PB N="87" REF="99">
from what we <HI>do</HI> comprehend; which, however comparatively little, is the real foundation of our faith in his omni&s;cience and omnipotence.</P>
<P>On the other hand it is, according to this writer, from the incomprehen|&s;ibility of the &s;criptures, as well as of the works of nature, that their divine origin is to be deduced.</P>
<P>The manner of rea&s;oning therefore, is not, as this writer a&s;&s;erts, the &s;ame in both ca&s;es, but totally different. In rea&s;oning from our view of the mate|rial world, we prudently rea&s;on from what we know, and how &s;hall we rea&s;on other|wi&s;e. "What can we rea&s;on but from what we know?" And yet, in logici&s;ing according to our author's mode from a view both of the material world and of revelation we fooli&s;hly attempt to rea&s;on from what we do <HI>not</HI> know.</P>

<PB N="103" REF="115">
this would be an argument worthy of rational and candid dei&s;ts, and de|mand a re&s;pectful attention; but when men pretend to di&s;prove facts by rea&s;oning, they have no right to expect an an&s;wer.</Q></P>
<P>Our author will, therefore, hardly think it worth his while to an&s;wer the que&s;tions, put to him, on this head, by certain Reviewers; who demand to know where, or by what pa&s;&s;ages the New Te&s;tament inculcates the doctrines he &s;pecifies: doctrines, which the <HI>rational</HI> advocates of Chri&s;tianity, they pretend, are afraid to adopt. <Q>The&s;e advocates,</Q> &s;ay they, <Q>cannot adopt notions and &s;entiments, which are founded on ambiguous, &s;igurative, or &s;acrificial expre&s;&s;ions; and &s;u&s;pect a mi&s;interpretation of &s;cripture, where the doctrine they embrace is
<PB N="104" REF="116">
far removed from every tract of the human imagination.</Q></P>
<P>This is exactly what our author upbraids them for, their wanting to reduce the extent of divine wi&s;dom to the line of the human under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, before we can ad|mit our author to have deduced any conclu&s;ive argument re&s;pecting the in|ternal evidence of the Chri&s;tian reli|gion, it is requi&s;ite he &s;hould certify what its doctrines are. The critics la&s;t|mentioned &s;u&s;pect a mi&s;interpretation of &s;cripture, where the doctrine they inculcate is far removed from every tract of the human imagination.&mdash;The <HI>Monthly</HI> Reviewers &s;ay al&s;o, <Q>it has not occurred to <HI>them</HI> that doctrines, al|lowed to be contradictory to rea&s;on, are not on this account the le&s;s cre|dible.</Q></P>
<P>On the other hand, our author
<PB N="105" REF="117">
makes their incon&s;i&s;tency with rea&s;on, and their being above the flight of hu|man imagination, the very criterion of their divine origin and, of cour&s;e, their credibility. The &s;criptures, accord|ing to him, <Q>contain ideas totally unheard of, and quite di&s;&s;imilar from any which had ever been thought on previous to their publication. No other, &s;ays he, ever drew &s;o ju&s;t a portrait of the worthle&s;sne&s;s of this world; and all its pur&s;uits, nor ex|hibited &s;uch di&s;tinct, lively and ex|qui&s;ite pictures of the joys of ano|ther; of the re&s;urrection of the dead, the la&s;t judgment, and the triumphs of the righteous in that tremendous day, when this corrup|tible &s;hall put on incorruption, and this mortal &s;hall put on immortality. No other has ever repre&s;ented the &s;upreme Being in the character of
<PB N="106" REF="118">
three per&s;ons united in one God. No other has attempted to reconcile tho&s;e &s;eeming contradictory but both true propo&s;itions, the contingency of future events, and the foreknow|ledge of God, or the free will of the creature with the <HI>over-ruling grace</HI> of the Creator. No other has &s;o fully declared the nece&s;&s;ity of wicked|ne&s;s and puni&s;hment, yet &s;o effec|tually in&s;tructed individuals to re&s;i&s;t the one, and to e&s;cape the other: no other has ever pretended to give any account of the depravity of man, or to point out any remedy for it: no other has ventured to de|clare the unpardonable nature of &s;in without the influence of a mediato|rial interpo&s;ition, and a vicarious atonement from the &s;ufferings of a &s;uperior Being.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="119">Such are the objects of the Chri&s;tian, Religion according to this author; but it is well known that the mo&s;t e&s;|&s;ential of the&s;e doctrines are either to|tally di&s;believed or explained away by a very con&s;iderable part of the profe&s;|&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity.</P>

<P>And &s;o far <HI>we</HI> agree with <HI>them</HI> that <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> is ju&s;t as well qualified to judge of the interpretation of particular texts and pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, as to judge of the authenticity of the whole.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>On his reply to a &s;econd objection, <Q>That the Old and New Te&s;tament can|not be a revelation from God, be|cau&s;e in them are to be found er|rors and incon&s;i&s;tencies, fabulous &s;tories, fal&s;e facts and fal&s;e philo|&s;ophy; which can never be deri|ved from the Fountain of all Truth.</Q>&mdash;This objection &s;hewn to
<PB N="126" REF="138">
be rather enforced by the author's conce&s;|&s;ions, than removed by his conclu&s;ions.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HERE our author very readily (and, as we before ob&s;erved, in our o|pinion, for his argument unnece&s;&s;a|rily) acknowledges that the &s;criptures are not revelations from God, but only the <HI>hi&s;tory</HI> of them. <Q>The reve|lation it&s;elf,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>is derived from God; but the hi&s;tory of it is the production of men, and there|fore the truth of it is not in the lea&s;t affected by their fallibility.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See View, page 123.</NOTE></P>
<P>He admits, of cour&s;e, that the in|&s;pired writers were not always under the influence of in&s;piration; for, if they had, &s;ays he, St Paul, who was &s;hipwrecked, and left his cloak and parchments at Troas, would not have put to &s;ea before a &s;torm, nor have
<PB N="127" REF="139">
forgot him&s;elf &s;o much as to leave his cloak behind him.</P>
<P>"But," continues he, <Q>if in the&s;e books a religion &s;uperior to all hu|man imagination actually exi&s;ts, it is of no con&s;equence to the proof of its divine origin, by what means it was there introduced, or with what human errors and imperfections it is blended. A diamond, though found in a bed of mud, is &s;till a dia|mond, nor can the dirt, which &s;ur|rounds it, depreciate its value or de|&s;troy its lu&s;tre.</Q></P>
<P>This allu&s;ion may be well calculated to catch the &s;imple apprehen&s;ion of the &s;uperficial reader; but, one of the lea&s;t di&s;crimination cannot fail to di&s;|cover how totally inapplicable it is to the &s;ubject in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>A fine lady, indeed, may carele&s;sly drop a manufactured brilliant into the
<PB N="128" REF="140">
kennel, to be accidentally picked up by a gold-finder; but rough diamonds are not originally found there; they have not their native bed in the &s;treets, or on the dunghill; but are dug from mines, prepared by Nature's proce&s;s for their production: in which &s;tate, al&s;o, they do not &s;hine with a lu&s;tre &s;o greatly &s;uperior to the &s;urrounding materials.</P>
<P>We by no means agree with our author, therefore, that his proof of the internal evidence of the divine origin of revelation, does not &s;uffer, by ad|mitting that <Q>the prophecies are all fortunate gue&s;&s;es or artful applica|tions, and the miracles there record|ed no better than legendary tales.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See View, page 131.</NOTE></P>
<P>On the contrary we conceive that &s;uch an heterogeneous mixture of truth and fal&s;ehood, as he hypothetically
<PB N="129" REF="141">
admits in the <HI>hi&s;tory,</HI> as he calls it, of revelation, would, if it really exi&s;ted there, very rea&s;onably bring the truths it contains into doubt.&mdash;Nay, we will go &s;o far as to admit that there really do appear &s;o many errors and incon|&s;i&s;tencies, in that hi&s;tory, that unen|lightened rea&s;on cannot reconcile them: the in&s;piration of <HI>grace</HI> being as nece&s;|&s;ary to point out the&s;e truths and induce a firm belief of them, as it was to di|rect and enable the in&s;pired writers to record them.</P>

<PB N="130" REF="142">

</ARGUMENT>
<P><Q>TO &s;ome &s;peculative and refined ob&s;ervers it has appeared incredible</Q>, &s;ays our author, <Q>that a wi&s;e and be|nevolent Creator &s;hould have con&s;ti|tuted a world upon one plan, and a religion for it on another; that is, that he &s;hould have revealed a reli|gion to mankind, which not only contradicts the principal pa&s;&s;ions and inclinations which he has implanted in their natures, but is incompatible with the whole oeconomy of that world which he has created, and in which he has thought proper to place them. This, &s;ay they, with
<PB N="131" REF="143">
regard to the Chri&s;tian, is apparently the ca&s;e: the love of power, riches, honour, and fame, are the great incitements to generous and magna|nimous actions; yet by this in&s;titu|tion are all the&s;e depreciated and di&s;|couraged. Government is e&s;&s;ential to the nature of man, and cannot be managed without certain degrees of violence, corruption, and impo&s;i|tion; yet are all the&s;e &s;trictly forbid. Nations cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without wars, nor war be carried on without ra|pine, de&s;olation, and murder: yet are the&s;e prohibited under the &s;eve|re&s;t threats. The non-re&s;i&s;tance of evil mu&s;t &s;ubject individuals to con|tinual oppre&s;&s;ions, and leave nations a defencele&s;s prey to their enemies; yet is this recommended. Perpetual patience under in&s;ults and injuries mu&s;t every day provoke new in&s;ults
<PB N="132" REF="144">
and new injuries, yet is this injoined. A neglect of all we eat and drink and wear, mu&s;t put an end to all com|merce, manufactures, and indu&s;try; yet is this required. In &s;hort, were the&s;e precepts univer&s;ally obeyed, the di&s;po&s;ition of all human affairs mu&s;t.be entirely changed, and the bu&s;ine&s;s of the world, con&s;tituted as it now is, could not go on.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Monthly</HI> Reviewers very ju&s;tly ob&s;erve, on this pa&s;&s;age, that no &s;eri|ous advocate for Chri&s;tianity can admit all the&s;e contradictions: for, indeed, they militate not le&s;s again&s;t the prac|tical principles of Chri&s;tianity than again&s;t: tho&s;e of Common-&s;en&s;e.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN an&s;wer to this <HI>fourth</HI> objection, our author very candidly and very &s;imply replies, that on examination all this will be found inevitable.&mdash;We be|lieve it; things could not po&s;&s;ibly be otherwi&s;e, becau&s;e &s;uch was the ge|neral de&s;ign of Providence, and &s;uch the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation, which was a part of it.</P>
<P>In reply to this objection, indeed, our author admits the whole force of it; which he endeavours to elude by a very &s;imple expedient: much &s;uch a|nother as that, by which he accounts el&s;ewhere for the origin of evil, Ne|ce&s;&s;ity! hard nece&s;&s;ity; which even the omnipotence of the Deity could not

prevent! What is this but making the God of the Chri&s;tians a mere heathen Jupiter, &s;ubject to the controul of &s;u|perior Fate?</P>
<P>He admits, that after Chri&s;tianity had had made its way, by means of the preach|ing of the poor and mean, in holes and caverns, under the iron rod of per&s;ecution, till it &s;o far prevailed as to obtain the countenance and protection of princes; when kings became its patrons, and queens its nur&s;ing mothers; he ad|mits, we &s;ay, that it could no longer with&s;tand the irre&s;i&s;tible effects of the natural imperfection of man and the political evils of civil &s;ociety. <Q>At length the meek and humble pro|fe&s;&s;ors of the go&s;pel in&s;laved the&s;e princes, and conquered the&s;e con|querors their patrons, and erected for them&s;elves &s;uch a &s;tupendous fabric of wealth and power, as the world

The&s;e, con&s;idered as decla|rations of facts only, neither con|tradict, or are above the reach of
<PB N="162" REF="174">
human rea&s;on: The fir&s;t is a propo|&s;ition as plain, as that three equila|ral lines compo&s;e one triangle <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That <HI>any three</HI> lines might do, properly di&s;po&s;ed, though <HI>not equal:</HI> indeed this allu|&s;ion is by no means adequate, and but little pertinent.</NOTE>, the other is as intelligible, as that one man &s;hould di&s;charge the debts of another. In what manner this union is formed, or why God accepts the&s;e vicarious puni&s;hments, or to what purpo&s;es they may be &s;ub&s;ervient, it informs us not, becau&s;e no informa|tion could enable us to comprehend the&s;e my&s;teries, and therefore it does not require that we &s;hould know or believe any thing about them.</Q></P>
<P>How! not <HI>any thing about them!</HI> Surely this is loo&s;ely and badly expre&s;|&s;ed! As a declaration of fact merely, it has been already ob&s;erved that the
<PB N="163" REF="175">
orthodox doctrine of the Trinity is not &s;o &s;imple and rational as here laid down; but much more complex and paradoxical.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>quomodo</HI> of the triunion, and the rea&s;on why God accepts of a vicarious atonement for the &s;ins of mankind; the&s;e are certainly beyond rational inve&s;tigation, but Chri&s;tians are doubtle&s;s required to believe &s;o much about them, as that the facts are as po&s;&s;ible as their declaration is true.</P>
<P>Again, if no information can enable us to comprehend the&s;e my&s;teries, it is not with very great propriety &s;uch important <HI>truths</HI> are &s;aid to be <HI>di&s;covered</HI> by Revelation. The doctrines as mere declarations, indeed, may be &s;aid to be <HI>di&s;covered,</HI> as they were not <HI>divulged</HI> before; but if tho&s;e doctrines them|&s;elves &s;till remain my&s;terious, they
<PB N="164" REF="176">
would with more propriety be &s;aid to be &s;imply declared or promulgated, than their <HI>truth</HI> to be <HI>di&s;covered.</HI></P>
<P>"The truth of the&s;e doctrines," our author owns, <Q>mu&s;t re&s;t intirely on the authority of tho&s;e who taught them; but then, &s;ays he, we &s;hould reflect that tho&s;e were the &s;ame per|&s;ons who taught us a &s;y&s;tem of reli|gion more &s;ublime, and of ethics more perfect, than any which our faculties were ever able to di&s;cover; but which, when di&s;covered, are exactly con&s;onant to our rea&s;on; and that therefore we &s;hould not ha&s;tily reject tho&s;e informations which they have vouch&s;afed to give us, of which our rea&s;on is not a competent judge.</Q></P>
<P>By the <HI>truth of the&s;e doctrines,</HI> he evidently means the <HI>credibility</HI> of them; but what he means by the <HI>exact con&s;o|nance</HI> of tho&s;e which are di&s;covered
<PB N="165" REF="177">
to our rea&s;on, we do not under&s;tand. It is from the want of &s;uch con&s;onance, nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;ing from the my&s;terious nature of &s;uch doctrines, that <HI>we</HI> de|duce the incompetency of rea&s;on to judge of their truth.</P>
<P>But men, as our author ju&s;tly ob|&s;erves, may very rea&s;onably believe propo&s;itions to be true, of who&s;e truth, neverthele&s;s, they are no competent judges. "If an able mathematician," &s;ays he, <Q>proves to us the truth of &s;e|veral propo&s;itions by demon&s;trations, which we under&s;tand, we he&s;itate not on his authority to a&s;&s;ent to others, the proce&s;s of who&s;e proofs we are not able to follow: why therefore &s;hould we refu&s;e that credit to Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, which we think rea&s;onable to give to one another.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="178">Why? indeed! It is very unrea|&s;onable: <HI>they</HI> doubtle&s;s de&s;erve our credit.&mdash;But &s;till we recur again to the <HI>authenticity</HI> of the <HI>hi&s;tory</HI> of the go&s;pel and the <HI>interpretation</HI> of its doctrines. Admitting, therefore, the propriety of placing the utmo&s;t confidence in the veracity of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, and that what they really meant to incul|cate is worthy of all acceptation, &s;till, we &s;ay, the cautious and candid Chri|&s;tian may, without the immediate di|rection of divine grace, remain at a lo&s;s what to believe.</P>
<P>As to what genuine Chri&s;tianity <HI>re|quires</HI> us to believe; here again we plead for the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ary latitude in matters of <HI>faith,</HI> as we have before done in <HI>morals</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We call it a <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> latitude; be|cau&s;e, to whatever purity of faith or mo|rals <HI>hypocri&s;y</HI> may pretend, men always de|ceive them&s;elves or others, when they affect to have a command, over their <HI>rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> which they can derive from no re|&s;ource either of Nature or Grace; the only &s;prings of human reflection and action</NOTE>. Indeed, our author
<PB N="167" REF="179">
is, in this re&s;pect, and very ju&s;tly, a latitudinarian too: for though he hath reduced the Chri&s;tian's creed, as before ob&s;erved, to a very &s;mall compa&s;s, he hath, by &s;o doing, opened a wide field for &s;ceptici&s;m. And yet &s;o far are the dictates of genuine Chri&s;tianity, even in our opinion, con&s;onant with rea&s;on, that, as it requires nothing which is <HI>impracticable</HI> to be <HI>performed,</HI> &s;o it requires nothing, which is <HI>impo&s;|&s;ible</HI> to be <HI>believed.</HI></P>
<P><Q>But how &s;hall &s;uch a &s;hort-&s;ighted Being as man know what is, or is not impo&s;&s;ible?</Q>&mdash;True; he may be con&s;cious of what is <HI>impracticable,</HI> as
<PB N="168" REF="180">
that regards him&s;elf, but he Cannot pre&s;cribe impo&s;&s;ibilities to God; of who&s;e omnipotence he is no judge. To infinite power every thing is po&s;|&s;ible, except, indeed, incon&s;i&s;tency or &s;elf-contradiction. Every propo&s;ition, therefore, re&s;pecting the deity, that doth not involve a contradiction in <HI>terms,</HI> however improbable or <HI>appa|rently</HI> impo&s;&s;ible, may yet be really po&s;&s;ible, and therefore believed on pro|per evidence, powerful per&s;ua&s;ion, or the influence of divine grace: whereas no kind or degree of evidence, no power of per&s;ua&s;ion, no influence human or divine can po&s;&s;ibly make any man be|lieve a <HI>contradiction</HI> in <HI>terms.</HI></P>
<P>This is one of tho&s;e <HI>impracticabilities</HI> which re&s;pects him&s;elf. Of the <HI>in|compatibility</HI> of <HI>facts</HI> he may not be a competent judge; but of the <HI>incon|gruity</HI> of his own <HI>deas,</HI> he cannot but be &s;en&s;ible. To a direct contradiction-in-<HI>terms,</HI>
<PB N="169" REF="181">
therefore, he cannot give his unfeigned a&s;&s;ent, though to the mo&s;t egregious fal&s;ehood or palpable con|trariety-in-<HI>fact,</HI> he may.</P>
<P>This di&s;tinction between a <HI>contra|riety</HI>-in-<HI>fact</HI> and a <HI>contradiction</HI>-in-<HI>terms,</HI> we conceive, has not &s;ufficiently been attended to. The one is popular, and phy&s;ical; con&s;i&s;ting of natural incon|&s;i&s;tency and moral improbabilities; the other philo&s;ophical and logical, con|&s;i&s;ting of artificial incon&s;i&s;tencies and verbal incongruities. Hence, how|ever incompetent human rea&s;on may be, to determine of po&s;&s;ibilities in nature and probabilities in providence, it is competent to judge of the agree|ment and di&s;agreement of its own ideas. Words, therefore, being the artificial &s;igns of our ideas, <HI>a contradic|tion-in-terms</HI> becomes obviou&s;ly and
<PB N="170" REF="182">
certainly di&s;caverable, whil&s;t a <HI>contra|riety-in-facts</HI> is not.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t fal&s;ehoods in fact, hence frequently pa&s;s for inconte&s;tible and demon&s;trable truths, on tho&s;e who would immediately detect a direct con|tradiction in terms.&mdash;To illu&s;trate this di&s;tinction by a familiar elucidation. A man as totally ignorant of the Co|pernican &s;y&s;tem as even the learned for|merly were, might be told that the &s;un is much bigger than the earth and does not move round it every twenty|four hours, as it appears to do; the earth only moving imperceptibly rounds its own axis and carrying round with it every thing adhering to its &s;urface with great rapidity.</P>
<P>An a&s;tronomer, we &s;ay, might tell an ignorant man this, who might either believe it, confiding in the a&s;tronomer's veracity, although it &s;eem|ed
<PB N="171" REF="183">
contrary to the evidence of his &s;en|&s;es; or he might di&s;believe and even deny it, confiding more in that evi|dence, he might &s;ay, <Q>I cannot be per&s;uaded out of my &s;en&s;es; I can &s;ee the &s;ize of the &s;un, and &s;ee it goes round the earth, which I al&s;o perceive &s;tands all the while &s;tock|&s;till. It is impo&s;&s;ible that I and every body about me &s;hould be whi&s;ked round with &s;uch velocity without our perceiving it.</Q>&mdash;If therefore, he &s;hould believe the a&s;tro|nomer's a&s;&s;ertion, however true it be in reality, he would believe, what we call, a contrariety-in-fact, viz. that things really are, as he perceives they are not. The &s;ame illu&s;tration holds good re&s;pecting the exi&s;tence of &s;oul and body, matter and &s;pirit, &amp;c; of which, it is popularly &s;uppo&s;ed, we have po&s;itive proo&s; or indubitable de|mon&s;tration;
<PB N="172" REF="184">
whereas we have nothing more than the imperfect evidence of our &s;en&s;ations and perceptions; which are &s;o far from directly affording us demon&s;tration of any thing, that they are con&s;tantly and egregiou&s;ly de|ceiving us in almo&s;t every thing.</P>
<P>It will follow from the e&s;tabli&s;hment of this di&s;tinction that, however ju&s;ti|fiable men of di&s;cernment may be in their di&s;belief or denial of <HI>incon&s;i&s;tent</HI> or <HI>&s;elf-contradictory propo&s;itions,</HI> the very limited extent of their knowledge in the works of nature and the ways of providence, di&s;qualifies them from taking upon them ab&s;olutely to deny improbable and even <HI>apparently</HI> impo&s;|&s;ible facts.</P>
<P>Another di&s;tinction, which here of|fers it&s;elf to our con&s;ideration, is <HI>that,</HI> between believing the truth of a doc|trine (or the believing that a doctrine
<PB N="173" REF="185">
is true) and the belief of that doctrine it&s;elf.</P>
<P>For a man may very properly be &s;aid to believe the truth of a propo&s;ition (in other words, that &s;uch propo&s;ition is true) although the doctrine or decla|ration, it contains, appears doubtful, nay although the terms of &s;uch pro|po&s;ition be totally unintelligible: in which latter ca&s;e he certainly cannot with any propriety be &s;aid to believe the propo&s;ition or doctrine it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The learned and ingenious author of a late plea for the divinity of Chri&s;t <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr Robin&s;on:</NOTE>, lays down in form, indeed, the follow|ing propo&s;ition: <Q>The belief of a pro|po&s;ition does not nece&s;&s;arily imply a clear idea of the object of which the propo&s;ition affirms any thing.</Q> So that in this ca&s;e a man may be &s;aid to
<PB N="174" REF="186">
<HI>believe</HI> a propo&s;ition he does not <HI>under|&s;tand.</HI> But to this we cannot &s;ub&s;cribe: a <HI>clear</HI> idea is certainly required as well of the <HI>&s;ubject</HI> as the <HI>predicate,</HI> though not a <HI>full</HI> or <HI>adequate</HI> idea. The idea entertained of God by a philo&s;opher and that attached to the &s;ame term by an ignorant clown, are widely different: the one, magnificent and exten&s;ive as human &s;cience can teach or imagina|tion conceive; the other mean and confined as ignorance and dulne&s;s can dictate. We will yet venture to &s;ay they are both equally <HI>clear;</HI> nay, we conceive the confined idea of the clown may be the cleare&s;t, as being more definite, in coming nearer the preci&s;ion of our ideas of material objects. This very preci&s;ion, indeed, is more de|&s;troyed by the effulgence of too much light than by the ob&s;curity attending the want of it; even as the face of the
<PB N="175" REF="187">
moon is &s;een clearer than that of the &s;un.</P>
<P>No doctrine or propo&s;ition, there|fore, can, in our opinion, be actually believed, unle&s;s it be clearly under|&s;tood; and yet propo&s;itions which are not clearly under&s;tood, nay not under|&s;tood at all, may comprehend a truth, or may be true; and "that they do "&s;o," is a propo&s;ition that may be be|lieved.</P>
<P>A man may believe, as already ob|&s;erved, a contrariety in fact, a great fal&s;ehood, &s;upported by competent evi|dence or credible affirmation; &s;o may he with equal propriety and on the &s;ame grounds believe the truth of a my&s;terious or even unintelligible pro|po&s;ition; or that &s;uch a propo&s;ition is true.</P>
<P>But then this is not the propo&s;ition he believes; this is quite a new one,
<PB N="176" REF="188">
viz, <Q>That the &s;aid my&s;terious or unintelligible propo&s;ition is true,</Q> which new propo&s;ition is neither my|&s;terious nor unintelligible, and there|fore may be believed <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It has been frivolou&s;ly objected that <Q>a mathematician, who demon&s;trates the truth of any propo&s;ition, does not <HI>believe</HI> it to be true; he <HI>knows</HI> it to be &s;o.</Q> True, he does not <HI>only believe</HI> it to be true, he does <HI>more,</HI> he al&s;o <HI>knows</HI> it to be &s;o; he believes not only the truth of the propo&s;ition, but the propo&s;ition it&s;elf. Knowledge includes belief, though belief does not include know|ledge.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thus a magi&s;trate or officer who ad|mini&s;ters affidavits <HI>ex officio</HI> and knows not the contents, may, on the credit and veracity of the deponent, believe the truth of his depo&s;ition, or that the contents of &s;uch depo&s;ition are true; but he cannot with any pro|priety
<PB N="177" REF="189">
priety be &s;aid to believe &s;uch affidavit it&s;elf or the contents of &s;uch depo&s;i|tion, becau&s;e he knows not what tho&s;e contents are and therefore can believe nothing about them.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;tinctions lead us naturally to a third, which, we flatter our&s;elves, may tend to conciliate the minds of polemical di&s;putants; or, at lea&s;t, to abate their rancour, which too often prevails between the orthodox and heterodox in religious di&s;putes: and this is the di&s;tinction, before hinted at, between the <HI>faith</HI> of the Chri&s;tian and the <HI>belief</HI> of the <HI>Philo&s;opher.</HI></P>
<P>The former does not require a ra|tional conviction of the propo&s;ition be|lieved; whereas the belief of a phi|lo&s;opher not only requires rational con|viction, founded on po&s;itive evidence, but it requires al&s;o a clear and preci&s;e comprehen&s;ion of all the terms of the
<PB N="178" REF="190">
propo&s;ition laid down, On the con|trary the unfeigned a&s;&s;ent, or volun|tary &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of rea&s;on, to the truth of a propo&s;ition, who&s;e terms are not even perfectly under&s;tood, is &s;uffici|ent to entitle a Chri&s;tian to rank among the number of the faithful <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Agreeable to our author's de&s;cription of the nature of faith, See page 79.</NOTE>. But a philo&s;opher, who makes every thing &s;ubmit to rea&s;on, cannot believe either that which he does not clearly conceive, or that of which he is not as clearly convinced.</P>
<P>Should he, as a man, be induced, by any means or motives, to give up the authority of his rea&s;on in matters where human rea&s;on is incompetent, he would do this, not as a <HI>Philo&s;opher,</HI> but as a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> and of eour&s;e be entitled to all the privileges and im|munities attached to that character.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="191">Of the&s;e our author has given an encouraging enumeration.&mdash;Unhap|pily for unbelievers, they require a proof of the truth of even tho&s;e ad|vantages, or, what would an&s;wer the &s;ame end, a belief or per&s;ua&s;ion of their reality. There can be no doubt but this would be &s;ufficient to make them immediately adopt an expedient, &s;o admirably calculated to promote their ea&s;e and happine&s;s. But whence is &s;uch belief or per&s;ua&s;ion to be de|rived? From rea&s;on? Surely not; un|le&s;s the truth of the Chri&s;tian religion could be much more rationally proved than by, what this writer calls, de|mon&s;tration.</P>
<P>But what, we a&s;k again, is demon|&s;tration? And what is its influence? Intuition is not demon&s;tration; in|&s;tinct is not demon&s;tration; perception
<PB N="180" REF="192">
is not demon&s;tration, nor is conceit demon&s;tration; and yet intuitive or in&s;tinctive impul&s;e, the force of ima|gination or firm per&s;ua&s;ion, may have equal influence on the mind, with that of the cleare&s;t demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>This influence, however, is of ano|ther kind; and, though it be not ra|tional, it has often a greater effect over even rational creatures than the mo&s;t clear and preci&s;e of rational de|ductions. We experience <HI>this,</HI> even in the common concerns of life: in the more <HI>uncommon,</HI> the force of incli|nation and the power of imagination, are &s;o notoriou&s;ly known to overpower the &s;tronge&s;t of our rea&s;oning faculties, that it were ab&s;urd to &s;upport the credit of demon&s;tration in ca&s;es, where even demon&s;tration it&s;elf mu&s;t give way to prejudice and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.&mdash;And if to prejudice and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;urely
<PB N="181" REF="193">
to the operation of Grace, and the in|fluence of divine in&s;piration!</P>
<P>That &s;omething more than the mere exerci&s;e of rea&s;on, or even a good-will, or inclination to believe, appears ne|nece&s;&s;ary from our author's own con|fe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"There are people," &s;ays he, <Q>who from particular motives have deter|mined with them&s;elves, that a pre|tended revelation founded on &s;o &s;trange and improbable a &s;tory, &s;o contradictory to rea&s;on, &s;o adver&s;e to the world and all its occupations, &s;o incredible in its doctrines, and in its precepts &s;o impracticable, can be nothing more than the impo|&s;ition of prie&s;tcraft upon ignorant and illiterate ages, and artfully con|tinued as an engine well-adapted to awe and govern the &s;uper&s;titious vulgar. To talk to &s;uch about the
<PB N="182" REF="194">
Chri&s;tian religion, is to conver&s;e with the deaf concerning mu&s;ic, or with the blind on the beauties of painting: They want all ideas rela|tive to the &s;ubject, and therefore can never be made to comprehend it; to enable them to do this, their minds mu&s;t be formed for the&s;e con|ceptions by contemplation, retire|ment, and ab&s;traction from bu&s;ine&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation, by ill-health, di&s;ap|pointment, and di&s;tre&s;&s;es; and po&s;|&s;ibly by <HI>divine interpo&s;ition,</HI> or by en|thu&s;ia&s;m, which is u&s;ually mi&s;taken for it. Without &s;ome of the&s;e pre|paratory aids, together with a com|petent degree of learning and appli|cation, it is impo&s;&s;ible that they can think or know, under&s;tand or be|lieve, any thing about it. If they profe&s;s to believe, they deceive o|thers; if they fancy that they be|lieve
<PB N="183" REF="195">
they deceive them&s;elves. I am ready to acknowledge, that the&s;e gentlemen, as far as their informa|tion reaches, are perfectly in the right; and if they are endued with good under&s;tandings, which have been entirely devoted to the bu&s;ine&s;s or amu&s;ements of the world, they can pa&s;s no other judgment, and mu&s;t revolt from the hi&s;tory and doctrines of this religion. 'The preaching Chri&s;t crucified was to the Jews a &s;tumbling block, and to the Greeks fooli&s;hne&s;s;' <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. i. 26.</NOTE> and &s;o it mu&s;t appear to all, who, like them, judge from e&s;tabli&s;hed prejudices, fal&s;e learning, and &s;uperficial knowledge; for tho&s;e who are quite unable to follow the chain of its prophecy, to &s;ee the beauty and ju&s;tne&s;s of its mo|ral precepts, and to enter into the

<P>This is &s;aying a great deal in di&s;cre|dit of a revelation, who&s;e divine ori|gin is &s;o obvious, and who&s;e doctrines are &s;o rea&s;onable as our author pre|tends.

<P>Granting, indeed, it be &s;o, and that the pur&s;uits of this world are &s;o totally incompatible with the things of the next; it &s;urely affords a &s;trong argu|ment that rea&s;on is an incompetent judge in <HI>every thing</HI> relative to the &s;y&s;|tem, and that nothing but divine in|&s;piration

<P>We are &s;orry, however, to find &s;uch <HI>divine interpo&s;ition</HI> put on a footing with <HI>ill-health,</HI> di&s;appointment, di&s;tre&s;s and even enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>Not that we conceive the mode of that interpo&s;ition to be confined to unaccountable impul&s;e or miraculous conver&s;ion.

<P>"And hence," continues he, <Q>per|haps it is, that faith, or ea&s;ine&s;s of belief, is &s;o frequently and &s;o &s;trong|ly recommended in the go&s;pel; be|cau&s;e <HI>if men require</HI> proofs, of which they them&s;elves are incapable, and tho&s;e who have no knowledge on this important &s;ubject will not

<P>Our author here &s;eems to have run away from his argument; the faith recommended in the go&s;pel and there|fore <HI>required</HI> of Chri&s;tians by <HI>God,</HI> may be widely different from that <HI>required</HI> by <HI>men</HI> either of them&s;elves or of o|thers; and, of cour&s;e, the <HI>requi&s;ite proofs</HI> of the doctrines believed, may be different al&s;o.</P>
<P>We cannot admit, therefore, this nece&s;&s;ity of any man's pinning his faith on his neighbour's &s;leeve. The mo&s;t ignorant and illiterate man is no farther removed from God, or inca|pable of receiving the illuminations of grace, than the greate&s;t philo&s;opher or the mo&s;t learned divine.

What <HI>God requires</HI> of them, as nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;alvation, they may &s;afely rely on him and the ordinary means of pro|vidence for in&s;truction.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e is different with tho&s;e, who, to gratify even a laudable cu|rio&s;ity, are inqui&s;itive about circum|&s;tances and doctrines une&s;&s;ential to &s;al|vation. The object of that curio&s;ity is a worldly object, and, if attained, mu&s;t be attained by worldly means. They who po&s;&s;e&s;s not the means of ori|ginal pur&s;uit, therefore, mu&s;t be con|tent, as a certain author expre&s;&s;es it, <Q>to receive the object of it at &s;econd hand: but the faith nece&s;&s;ary to &s;al|vation is no &s;uch <HI>&s;tale bargain,</HI> it is the <HI>immediate gift</HI> of God.</Q></P>
<P>Our author would have the inatten|tive and illiterate receive this gift at the hands of <HI>man;</HI> and, becau&s;e uninform|ed rea&s;on is not to be depended on in

&s;hall add only a few cur&s;ory reflections re&s;pecting the &s;tate of the argument in general:</P>
<P>And fir&s;t let us ob&s;erve that were we di&s;po&s;ed to take away even the &s;lighte&s;t prop, on which the popu|lar belief of revelation re&s;ts, we might expo&s;e to the greate&s;t ridicule tho&s;e vain boa&s;tings of vaunting ca&s;ui&s;ts, who, declaring the truths of chri&s;tia|nity to be &s;it objects of rational inve&s;ti|gation, invite the attacks of argu|ment, wit, and ridicule, and boldly bid them defiance. Among the&s;e we may particularize, as of late the mo&s;t eminent and con&s;picuous, that ingenious and ju&s;tly celebrated philo|&s;opher, Dr. Jo&s;eph Prie&s;tly and his very able coadjutors in the theological repo&s;itory.</P>
<P>It was with a very bad grace, al&s;o, the celebrated author of the <HI>Divine
<PB N="205" REF="217">
Legation</HI> made a &s;imilar boa&s;t and threw out the &s;ame defiance again&s;t the free|thinkers; while the civil power was actually up in arms to cru&s;h one of, the dulle&s;t, and inoffen&s;ive in&s;ects of the whole tribe; poor old Peter An|net! It was certainly a glorious tri|umph over infidelity and a fine proof of the clerical faith in the impregnability of the Chri&s;tian church, the getting a decrepid dotard of eighty, &s;entenced to be impri&s;oned in Newgate, pilloried in the public &s;treets, and condemned to beat hemp in Bridewell for a twelve|month; and all merely for pu&s;hing a few pitiful pellets, out of the pop-gun of his wretched goo&s;e-quill, again&s;t the credibility, of the Mo&s;aic hi&s;tory of the plagues of Egypt!</P>
<P>Why was not the artillery of the ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical fortre&s;s levelled at &s;ome more formidable foe? in their oppo|&s;ition
<PB N="206" REF="218">
to whom tho&s;e doughty engineers might have reaped &s;ome credit for their valour (if not for their conduct) and have at lea&s;t e&s;caped the odium, which ever falls on <HI>cowards</HI> for their <HI>cruelty!</HI></P>
<P>They may re&s;t, however, &s;ecure: the a&s;hes of poor Peter will remain quiet in his grave. We dare &s;ay there was not &s;o much &s;pirit buried with them, as to cau&s;e any future di&s;tur|bance either to him or them! <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We are a&s;&s;ured that a late Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury thought the puni&s;hment of this poor man &s;o much greater than his crime, that he allowed him a &s;tipend for life, after he had &s;ubmitted to, and under|gone, the &s;entence of the law.</NOTE></P>
<P>The digni&s;ied eccle&s;ia&s;tic abovemen|tioned has been bold enough to &s;ay, in &s;ome of his prefaces, that the free|thinkers (as they are fal&s;ely &s;tiled)

<P>The writer of this critique can as truly aver his &s;incerity as the author of the pamphlet, which is the &s;ubject of it. He can truly &s;ay that, with the mo&s;t ardent de&s;ire of reconciling reve|lation to rea&s;on, he long and labori|ou&s;ly

<P>And yet, though early in&s;tructed to pay the mo&s;t profound reverence and put the mo&s;t implicit faith in the or|thodox doctrines of Chri&s;tianity, the more clo&s;ely he applied the criterion of rea&s;on the more clearly did that crite|rion appear to be inapplicable.

<P>If we are a&s;ked then, whether as <HI>mere rational</HI> beings, we can believe &s;uch propo&s;itions? we frankly an&s;wer, no.&mdash;And yet, experimentally con|vinced how &s;hort is the line of the hu|man under&s;tanding, how inadequate the &s;tronge&s;t powers of &s;en&s;e and ge|nius to penetrate the veil of nature and of providence, we can readily &s;ubmit our rea&s;on to revelation, and give our unfeigned a&s;&s;ent, as <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> to the truth of propo&s;itions, which, as <HI>men.</HI> and <HI>philo&s;ophers,</HI> we can neither fully under&s;tand nor clearly conceive.&mdash;Be|lieving though not on any rational conviction, that <HI>faith,</HI> or as our author properly de&s;cribes it, an a&s;&s;ent to the e&s;&s;ential doctrines of Chri&s;tianity, is a religious duty enjoined every man, who lives under the di&s;pen&s;ation of the
<PB N="214" REF="226">
go&s;pel, we believe, even as <HI>men,</HI> &s;o much of them as we comprehend; per&s;uaded that even what we do not comprehend, would command our belief, if we did, in the &s;ame propor|tion.</P>
<P>We can unfeignedly do this, even while the <HI>truth,</HI> as it is called, of &s;uch my&s;terious propo&s;itions appears doubt|ful, nay while even the terms of &s;uch propo&s;itions appear in part or altoge|ther unintelligible.</P>
<P>It is a favorite maxim with our modern rationali&s;ts (or as &s;ome call them <HI>divines</HI>) that <Q>where my&s;tery begins religion ends.</Q> This maxim is, in our opinion, &s;o far from being applicable to the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> religion, that we think the <HI>faith</HI> of the Chri&s;|tian applicable chie&s;ly to its my&s;teries, with which it begins and ends.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="227">There would, indeed, be &s;omething my&s;terious in the promulgation even of the <HI>morals</HI> of Chri&s;tianity, if we could be brought to believe the prac|tice of them in their declared <HI>purity</HI> to be in our pre&s;ent &s;tate required of us; a practice &s;o diametrically oppo|&s;ite to the gratification of the appetites and pa&s;&s;ions of human nature, and even to the laws of ju&s;tice and equity admit|ted in natural religion.</P>
<P><Q>To &s;ubmit to every in&s;ult, to re|turn good for evil, to love tho&s;e that hate us, and wi&s;h well to them that de&s;pitefully u&s;e us,</Q> are tenets &s;o contrary as well to our natural impa|tience of injuries as to our ideas of na|tural ju&s;tice, that, however the meek|&s;pirited and grace-endowed individual may adopt them in private practice, no community of Chri&s;tians ever yet
<PB N="216" REF="228">
dared to admit them into their &s;y&s;tem of civil policy.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Faith</HI> of the Chri&s;tian if it be not exerci&s;ed on the my&s;teries of his religion, we &s;ee neither u&s;e nor merit in his belief. If he believe nothing but what appears rational and pro|bable, nothing but what is evinced by a cloud of witne&s;&s;es, and carries with it the cleare&s;t conviction, in what is it more meritorious than the creed of the &s;keptic or infidel? for even <HI>they</HI> have their <HI>creed.</HI></P>
<P>"Becau&s;e thou ha&s;t &s;een me (faith our Saviour to Didymus) thou ha&s;t believed ble&s;&s;ed are they that have not &s;een, and yet have believed."</P>
<P>We think this text perfectly appli|cable to &s;uch as, like our author, are anxious to prove the divine authority of the Scriptures by rational argu|ment: in doing which, we think
<PB N="217" REF="229">
them ju&s;t as ill employed as, this writer &s;ays, they would be in pretending to accommodate the &s;criptural doctrines to our natural ideas of rectitude and truth.</P>
<P>The well-di&s;po&s;ed reader, therefore, &s;ubmitting his <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> to <HI>Revelation,</HI> and his belief of its divine origin, as well as of its e&s;&s;ential doctrines, to a &s;uperior mode of conviction, the influence of Grace, would do well patiently to wait the effect of its operation in God's own place and time, and not be importu|nately anxious for the elucidation of ob&s;curities, which nothing but divine illumination can illu&s;trate.</P>
<P>For, after all, what men generally mean by the <HI>truth</HI> of the doctrines of revelation, is their con&s;onance or con|gruity with the deductions of common|&s;en&s;e and mere unenlightened rea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="230">The truly-devout need be under no apprehen&s;ion of being guilty of a ne|glect of religious duty, in thus patient|ly-waiting for that in&s;piration from above, which only can, make them wi&s;e unto &s;alvation.</P>
<P>In the mean time, they &s;hould not be &s;urprized nor alarmed at finding their notions of divine truths not ex|actly to coincide with tho&s;e of other men, of who&s;e talents, gifts or graces, they may entertain a higher opinion than they do of their own.</P>
<P>As there are few, if any, per&s;ons in the world, that either hear, &s;ee or feel external objects exactly alike (our ner|vous &s;y&s;tems being as diver&s;ified as our features) &s;o there are as few that con|ceive exactly alike the meaning of any one moral or religious propo&s;ition; e|ven divine in&s;piration it&s;elf accommo|dating
<PB N="219" REF="231">
its influence to the different fa|culties of the individual.</P>
<P>This reflection, above all others, &s;hould excite us to the exerci&s;e of that Chri&s;tian charity, which, covering a multitude of &s;ins, we &s;hould throw, as a veil of univer&s;al candour, over the mi&s;takes and errours of the re&s;t of man|kind; ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pecting that, with re|gard to others more enlightened than our&s;elves, we may &s;tand in need of the &s;ame indulgence.</P>
