<P>This Pamphlet is, without Flattery to its Author, as ju&s;t and well written a Piece, as, of its King, I ever &s;aw; &s;o that at the &s;ame Time that it highly de&s;erves, it certainly &s;tands very little in need of this Re|commendation.&mdash;As to the Hi&s;tory of the unfortunate Per&s;on who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e Memoirs compo&s;e this Work, it is certainly penned with equal Accuracy and Spirit, of which I am &s;o much the better Judge, as I know many of the Facts mentioned in it to be &s;trictly true, and very fairly related. Be&s;ides, it is not only the Story of Mr <HI>Savage,</HI> but innume|rable Incidents relating to other Per&s;ons and other Affairs, which render this a very amu&s;ing, and withal, a very in&s;tructive and valuable Perfor|mance.&mdash;The Author's Ob&s;ervations are &s;hort, &s;ignificant, and ju&s;t, as his Narrative is remarkably &s;mooth, and well di&s;po&s;ed.

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE OF <HI>JOHN PHILIP BARRETIER,</HI> Compiled from his Father's LETTERS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>_JOHN PHILIP BARRETIER</HI> was born at <HI>Schwabach, Jan.</HI> 19, 1720-21.</P>
<P>His Father was <HI>Francis Bar|retier,</HI> Pa&s;tor of the <HI>Calvini&s;t</HI> Church of that Place, who took upon him&s;elf the Care of his Education, for which he formed a Scheme, that &s;eems to be &s;uffici|ently vindicated by its Succe&s;s from the Cen&s;ures to which new Attempts are generally expo&s;ed, and therefore requires a very parti|cular Account; for if M. <HI>Le Fevre</HI> thought
<PB N="2" REF="4">
the Method in which he taught his Children, worthy to be communicated to the learned World, how ju&s;tly may M. <HI>Barretier</HI> claim the univer&s;al Attention of Mankind to this new Scheme that has produced &s;uch a &s;tupendous Progre&s;s! The Authors, who have endeavoured to teach Rules for obtain|ing a long Life, however they have failed in their Attempts, are univer&s;ally confe&s;&s;ed to have, at lea&s;t, the Merit of a great and noble De&s;ign, and to have de&s;erved Gratitude and Honour. How much more then is due to M. <HI>Barretier,</HI> who has &s;ucceeded in what they have only attempted? For to prolong Life, and improve it, are nearly the &s;ame. If to have all that Riches can purcha&s;e is to be rich, to do all that can be done in a long Time, is to live long, and he is equally a Benefactor to Mankind, who teaches them to protract the Duration, or &s;horten the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Life.</P>
<P>That there are therefore few Things more worthy our Curio&s;ity than this Method, by which the Father a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Genius of the Son, every Man will be convinced, who &s;hall hear the early Proficiency at which it enabled him to arrive, &s;uch as no one has yet reached at the &s;ame Age, and to which it is therefore probable that every advantageous Circum|&s;tance concurred.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5">
<HI>French,</HI> which was the native Language of his Mother, was that which he learned fir&s;t, mixed, by living in <HI>Germany,</HI> with &s;ome Words of the Language of the Country. Af|ter &s;ome Time his Father took Care to intro|duce, in his Conver&s;ation with him, &s;ome Words of <HI>Latin,</HI> in &s;uch a Manner that he might di&s;cover the Meaning of them by the Connexion of the Sentence, or the Occa&s;ion on which they were u&s;ed, without ob&s;erving, that he had any Intention of in&s;tructing him, or that any new Attainment was propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>By this Method of Conver&s;ation, in which new Words were every Day introduced, when his Ear had been &s;omewhat accu&s;tomed to the Inflections and Variations of the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue, he began to attempt to &s;peak like his Father, and was in a &s;hort Time drawn on by imper|ceptible Degrees to &s;peak <HI>Latin,</HI> intermixed with any other Language.</P>
<P>Thus, when he was but four Years old, he &s;poke, every Day, <HI>French</HI> to his Mother, <HI>Latin</HI> to his Father, and <HI>High Dutch</HI> to the Maid, without any Perplexity to him&s;elf, or any Confu&s;ion of one Language with another.</P>
<P>While he was thus learning Languages without Study, and almo&s;t without perceiving that he was learning, his Father took care to teach him to read and write, of which he per|form'd
<PB N="4" REF="6">
one without Books, and the other with|out Paper; but by what Methods we are not informed. It is indeed ea&s;y to conceive many that might be u&s;ed, nor does it &s;eem, with re&s;pect to the Art of Writing, of any Impor|tance, whether he made his fir&s;t E&s;&s;ays with Paper, or any other Materials, as the Opera|tion mu&s;t be nearly the &s;ame. The&s;e Methods, whatever they were, &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that he was able to read currently at the Age of three Years, and &s;oon after was taught to write.</P>
<P>When he had thus learned to read, his Fa|ther put &s;ome Books into his Hands, chiefly &s;uch as were filled with Pictures accompanied with Explanations. With the&s;e the young Student was wonderfully delighted, when he perceived, &s;ays the Author of his Life, that they talked and rea&s;oned like him&s;elf, and from that Time might be dated his wonderful Fondne&s;s for Books which became greater every Day.</P>
<P>The other Languages of which he was Ma&s;ter, he learned by a Method yet more uncommon. The only Book that he made u&s;e of was the Bible, which his Father laid before him in the Language he then propo&s;ed to learn, accompanied with a Tran&s;lation, be|ing taught by Degrees the Inflections of Nouns and Verbs. This Method, &s;ays his
<PB N="5" REF="7">
Father, made the <HI>Latin</HI> more familiar to him in his fourth Year than any other Language.</P>
<P>When he was near the End of his &s;ixth Year, he entered upon the Study of the Old Te&s;tament in its original Language, beginning with the Book of <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> to which his Fa|ther confined him for &s;ix Months, after which he read cur&s;orily over the re&s;t of the Hi&s;torical Books in which he found very little Difficulty, and then applied him&s;elf to the Study of the poetical Writers, and the Prophets, which he read over &s;o often, with &s;o clo&s;e an Atten|tion, and &s;o happy a Memory, that he could not only tran&s;late them without a Moment's He&s;itation into <HI>Latin</HI> or <HI>French,</HI> but turn, with the &s;ame Facility, the Tran&s;lations into the original Language in his tenth Year.</P>
<P>When he was only eight Years old, he could repeat not only all the P&s;alms in <HI>Hebrew,</HI> but all that Collection of Texts which <HI>Henricus Opitius</HI> has publi&s;hed under the Title of <HI>Bi|blia Parva;</HI> this Collection he tran&s;cribed, and added to it a new Tran&s;lation. He drew up likewi&s;e in 400 Pages in <HI>Quarto,</HI> a Dictionary of the mo&s;t rare and difficult Words of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Language, in which be inter&s;per&s;ed a great Number of curious Remarks and critical Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8">
Having now gained &s;uch a Degree of Skill in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Language as to be able to com|po&s;e in it both in Pro&s;e and Ver&s;e, he was ex|tremely de&s;irous of reading the <HI>Rabbins;</HI> and having borrowed of the neighbouring Cler|gy, and the Jews of <HI>Schwabach,</HI> all the Books with which they could &s;upply him, he prevailed on his Father to buy him the great <HI>Rabinical</HI> Bible, publi&s;hed at <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> in 4 <HI>Tomes,</HI> Folio, 1728, and read it with that Accuracy and Attention which appears by the Account of it written by him to his Favourite M. <HI>Le Maitre,</HI> in&s;erted in the Beginning of the 26th Volume of the <HI>Bibliotheque Germanique.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Writers were read by him, as other young Per&s;ons peru&s;e Romances or Novels, only from a puerile De&s;ire of Amu&s;ement; for he had &s;o little Veneration for them, even while he &s;tudied them with mo&s;t Eagerne&s;s, that he often diverted his Parents with re|counting their Fables and Chimeras.</P>
<P>At the Age of nine Years, he not only was Ma&s;ter of five Languages, an Attainment in it&s;elf almo&s;t incredible, but under&s;tood, &s;ays his <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In a Letter which was communicated to the Author of this Account.</NOTE> Father, the holy Writers, better in their original Tongues, than in his own. If he means by this A&s;&s;ertion, that he knew the Sen&s;e of many Pa&s;&s;ages in the Original, which were
<PB N="7" REF="9">
ob&s;cure in the Tran&s;lation, the Account, how|ever wonderful, may be admitted; but if he intends to tell his Corre&s;pondent, that his Son was better acquainted with the two Languages of the Bible, than with his own, he mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;peak hyperbolically, or to admit that his Son had &s;omewhat neglected the Stu|dy of his native Language: Or we mu&s;t own, that the Fondne&s;s of a Parent has tran&s;ported him into &s;ome natural Exaggerations.</P>
<P>Part of this Letter I am tempted to &s;up|pre&s;s, being unwilling to demand the Belief of others to that which appears incredible to my&s;elf; but as my Incredulity may, perhaps, be the Product rather of Prejudice than Rea|&s;on, as Envy may beget a Di&s;inclination to admit &s;o immen&s;e a Superiority, and as an Account is not to be immediately cen&s;ured as fal&s;e, merely becau&s;e it is wonderful, I &s;hall proceed to give the re&s;t of his Father's Rela|tion, from his Letter of the 3d of <HI>March,</HI> 1729-30. He &s;peaks, continues he, <HI>German, Latin</HI> and <HI>French</HI> equally well. He, can by laying before him a Tran&s;lation, read any of the Books of the Old or New Te&s;tament in its original Language, without He&s;itation or Perplexity. He is no Stranger to Biblical Critici&s;m or Philo&s;ophy, nor unacquainted with antient or modern Geography, and is
<PB N="8" REF="10">
qualified to &s;upport a Conver&s;ation with learned Men, who frequently vi&s;it and corre&s;pond with him.</P>
<P>In his eleventh Year, he not only publi&s;hed a learned Letter in <HI>Latin,</HI> but tran&s;lated the Travels of <HI>Rabbi Benjamin</HI> from the <HI>Hebrew</HI> into <HI>French,</HI> which he illu&s;trated with Notes, and accompanied with Di&s;&s;ertations; a Work in which his Father, as he him&s;elf declares, could give him little A&s;&s;i&s;tance, as he did not under&s;tand the Rabbinical Dialect.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on for which his Father engaged him in this Work, was only to prevail upon him to write a fairer Hand than he had hi|therto accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to do, by giving him Hopes, that if he &s;hould tran&s;late &s;ome little Author, and offer a fair Copy of his Ver&s;ion to &s;ome Book&s;eller, he might in Re|turn for it, have other Books which he wanted and could not afford to purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>Incited by this Expectation, he fixed upon the <HI>Travels of Rabbi Benjamin,</HI> as mo&s;t pro|per for his Purpo&s;e, being a Book neither bulky nor common, and in one Month com|pleated his Tran&s;lation, applying only one or two Hours a Day to that particular Task. In another Month, he drew up the principal Notes; and in the third, wrote &s;ome Di&s;&s;er|tations
<PB N="9" REF="11">
upon particular Pa&s;&s;ages which &s;eemed to require a larger Examination.</P>
<P>The&s;e Notes contain &s;o many curious Re|marks, and Enquiries out of the common Road of Learning, and afford &s;o many In&s;tan|ces of Penetration, Judgment, and Accuracy, that the Reader finds in every Page &s;ome Rea|&s;on to per&s;uade him that they cannot po&s;&s;ibly be the Work of a Child, but of a Man long accu&s;tomed to the&s;e Studies, enlightened by Reflection, and dextrous, by long Practice, in the U&s;e of Books. Yet, that it is the Per|formance of a Boy thus young, is not only proved by the Te&s;timony of his Father, but by the concurrent Evidence of M. <HI>Le Maitre,</HI> his A&s;&s;ociate in the Church of <HI>Schwobach,</HI> who not only a&s;&s;erts his Claim to this Work, but affirms, that he heard him, at &s;ix Years of Age, explain the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Text as if it had been his native Language; &s;o that the Fact is not to be doubted, without a Degree of Incre|dulity which it will not be very ea&s;y to defend.</P>
<P>This Copy was however far from being written with the Neatne&s;s which his Father de&s;ired, nor did the Book&s;ellers, to whom it was offered, make Propo&s;als agreeable to the Expectation of the young Tran&s;lator; but af|ter having examined the Performance in their
<PB N="10" REF="12">
ner, and determined to print it upon Condi|tions not very advantageous, returned it to be tran&s;cribed, that the Printers might not be embarra&s;&s;ed with a Copy &s;o difficult to read.</P>
<P><HI>Barretier</HI> was now advanced to the latter End of his twelfth Year, and had made great Advances in his Studies, notwith&s;tanding an ob&s;tinate Tumour in his left Hand, which gave him great Pain, and obliged him to a tedious and trouble&s;ome Method of Cure; and reading over his Performance, was &s;o far from contenting him&s;elf with barely tran&s;cribing it, that he altered the greate&s;t Part of the Notes, new-modelled the Differtations, and augmented the Book to twice its former Bulk.</P>
<P>What Applau&s;es are due to an old Age, wa&s;ted in a &s;crupulous Attention to Particles, Accents and Etymologies, may appear, &s;ays his Father, by &s;eeing how little Time is required to arrive at &s;uch an Eminence in the&s;e Stu|dies as many even of the&s;e venerable Doctors, have not attained, for want of rational Me|thods and regular Application.</P>
<P>This Cen&s;ure is doubtle&s;s ju&s;t, upon tho&s;e who &s;pend too much of their Lives upon u&s;e|le&s;s Niceties, or who appear to labour without making any Progre&s;s. But as the Knowledge of Languages is nece&s;&s;ary, and a minute Accuracy &s;ometimes requi&s;ite, they are by no Means to be blamed, who, in Com|pliance
<PB N="11" REF="13">
with the particular Benefit of their own Minds, make the Difficulties of dead Languages their chief Study, and arrive at Excellence proportionate to their Application, &s;ince it was to the Labour of &s;uch Men that his Son was indebted for his own Learning.</P>
<P>Thus he continued his Studies, neither drawn a&s;ide by Plea&s;ures, nor di&s;couraged by Difficulties. The greate&s;t Ob&s;tacle to his Im|provement was want of Books, with which his narrow Fortune could not liberally &s;upply him; &s;o that he was obliged to borrow the greate&s;t Part of tho&s;e which his Studies re|quired, and to return them when he had read them, without being able to con&s;ult them oc|ca&s;ionally, or to recur to them, when his Me|mory &s;hould fail him.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable, that neither his Diligence, unintermitted as it was, nor his Want of Books, a Want of which he was in the highe&s;t Degree &s;en&s;ible, ever produced in him that A&s;perity, which a long and reclu&s;e Life, with|out any Circum&s;tance of Di&s;quiet, frequently create. He was always gay, lively, and fa|cetious, a Temper which contributed much to recommend his Learning, and of which &s;ome Students much &s;uperior in Age would con&s;ult their Ea&s;e, their Reputation and their Inte|re&s;t by copying from him.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="14">
His Father being &s;omewhat unea&s;y to ob|&s;erve &s;o much Time &s;pent by him on Rabini|cal Trifles, thought it nece&s;&s;ary now to recall him to the Study of the <HI>Greek</HI> Language, which he had of late neglected; but to which he returned with &s;o much Ardour, that in a &s;hort Time he was able to read <HI>Greek</HI> with the &s;ame Facility as <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Latin.</HI></P>
<P>In his twelfth Year he applied more parti|cularly to the Study of the Fathers and Coun|cils of the fir&s;t &s;ix Centuries, and began to make a regular Collection of their Canons. He read every Author in the Original, having di&s;co|vered &s;o much Negligence or Ignorance in mo&s;t Tran&s;lations, that he paid no Regard to their Authority.</P>
<P>Soon after he undertook, at his Father's De|&s;ire, to confute a Treati&s;e of <HI>Samuel Crellius,</HI> in which, under the Name of <HI>Artemonius,</HI> he has endeavoured to &s;ub&s;titute in the Beginning of St <HI>John</HI>'s Go&s;pel, a Reading different from that which is at pre&s;ent received, and le&s;s fa|vourable to the orthodox Doctrine of the Di|vinity of our Saviour.</P>
<P>This Task was undertaken by <HI>Barretier</HI> with great Ardour, and pro&s;ecuted by him with &s;uitable Application, for he not only drew up a formal Confutation of <HI>Artemonius,</HI> but made large Collections from the earlie&s;t
<PB N="13" REF="15">
Writers, relating to the Hi&s;tory of Here&s;ies, which he propo&s;ed at fir&s;t to have publi&s;hed as Preliminaries to his Book; but finding the Introduction grew at la&s;t to a greater Bulk than the Book it&s;elf, he determined to print it apart.</P>
<P>While he was engro&s;&s;ed by the&s;e Enquiries, Accident threw a Pair of Globes into his Hands, in <HI>Oct.</HI> 1734. by which his Curio&s;ity was &s;o much exalted, that he laid a&s;ide his <HI>Artemonius,</HI> and applied him&s;elf to Geogra|phy and A&s;tronomy. In ten Days he was able to &s;olve all the Problems in the Doctrine of the Globes, and had attained Ideas &s;o clear and &s;trong of all the Sy&s;tems, as well ancient as modern, that he began to think of making new Di&s;coveries; and for that Pur|po&s;e, laying a&s;ide for a Time all Searches into Antiquity, he employed his utmo&s;t Intere&s;t to procure Books of A&s;tronomy and of Mathe|maticks, and made &s;uch a Progre&s;s in three or four Months, that he &s;eemed to have &s;pent his whole Life upon that Study; for he not only made an A&s;trolabe, and drew up a&s;trono|mical Tables; but invented new Methods of Calculation, or &s;uch at lea&s;t as appeared new to him, becau&s;e they were not mentioned in the Books which he had then an Opportunity of Reading, and it is a &s;ufficient Proof both of
<PB N="14" REF="16">
the Rapidity of his Progre&s;s, and the Extent of his Views, that in three Months after his fir&s;t Sight of a Pair of Globes, he formed Schemes for finding the Longitude, which he &s;ent, in <HI>Jan.</HI> 1735, to the Royal Society at <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>His Scheme, being recommended to the Society by the Queen, was con&s;idered by them with a Degree of Attention which, perhaps, would not have been be&s;towed upon the At|tempt of a Mathematician &s;o young, had he not been dignified with &s;o illu&s;trious a Patro|nage. But it was &s;oon found, that for want of Books, he had imagined him&s;elf the Inven|tor of Methods already in common U&s;e, and that he propo&s;ed no Means of di&s;covering the Longitude, but &s;uch as had been already tried and found in&s;ufficient. Such will be very frequently the Fate of tho&s;e who&s;e Fortune either condemns them to &s;tudy, without the nece&s;&s;ary A&s;&s;i&s;tance from Libraries, or who, in too much Ha&s;te, publi&s;h their Di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>This Attempt exhibited, however, &s;uch a Specimen of his Capacity for mathematical Learning, and &s;uch a Proof of an early Pro|ficiency, that, in 1735, the Royal Society of <HI>Berlin</HI> admitted him as one of their Members.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="17">
Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e Avocations and Amu&s;ements, he publi&s;hed, in 1735, Anti-Artemonius, <HI>&s;eu Initium Evangelii S. Jo|hannis Apo&s;toli, adver&s;us iniqui&s;&s;imam</HI> L. M. Artemonij <HI>Neo-Photiniani Criticam vindica|tum atq, illu&s;tratum, qu&acirc; Occa&s;ione etiam multa alia S. Scripturae Veterumque Loca vin|dicantur, et multis Antiquitatis Monumentis Lux affunditur, cui in Fine accedit Di&s;&s;ertatio de Dialogis tribus</HI> Theodoreto <HI>vulgo tributis.</HI> Auctore <HI>J. P. Barreterio, SS. Theologiae</HI> alia|rumque bonarum Artium Cultore. <HI>Norimbergae.</HI> 8vo.</P>
<P>This Work is divided into five Parts. In the fir&s;t of which <HI>Barretier</HI> proves, that the Text was always read as it now &s;tands. In the Se|cond he &s;hews, that <HI>Artemonius</HI>'s Notion of the Method by which it was changed, is groundle&s;s. In the Third, he examines the internal Evidence brought by <HI>Artemonius</HI> to prove that St <HI>John</HI> could not write the Words as they are now read. In the Fourth, he re|futes the Opinion of <HI>Socinus,</HI> that St <HI>John</HI> &s;aying, that <HI>by the Word all Things were made,</HI> &s;peaks of a new Creation. In the Fifth, he proves the Divinity of our Saviour from other Parts of the holy Writings, and con|cludes with a Paraphra&s;e of the fir&s;t Ver&s;es of St <HI>John</HI>'s Go&s;pel. To the whole is added an
<PB N="16" REF="18">
E&s;&s;ay to prove, that the Dialogues a&s;cribed to <HI>Theodoret,</HI> are the Work of another Writer.</P>
<P>He had now attained &s;uch a Degree of Re|putation, that not only the Public, but Prin|ces, who are commonly the la&s;t by whom Me|rit is di&s;tingui&s;hed, began to intere&s;t them|&s;elves in his Succe&s;s; for the &s;ame Year the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> who had heard of his early Advances in Literature, on Account of a Scheme for di&s;covering the Longitude, which had been &s;ent to the Royal Society of <HI>Berlin,</HI> and which was tran&s;mitted afterwards by him to <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>London,</HI> engaged to take care of his Fortune, having received further Proofs of his Abilities at his own Court, to which he was introduced in the following Manner.</P>
<P>M. <HI>Barretier,</HI> being promoted to the Cure of the Church of <HI>Stetin,</HI> was obliged to travel with his Son thither from <HI>Schwobach,</HI> thro' <HI>Leip&s;ic</HI> and <HI>Berlin,</HI> a Journey very agreaable to his Son, as it would furni&s;h him with new Opportunities of improving his Knowledge, and extending his Acquaintance among Men of Letters. For this Purpo&s;e they &s;taid &s;ome time at <HI>Leip&s;ic,</HI> and then travelled to <HI>Hall,</HI> where young <HI>Barretier</HI> &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed him|&s;elf in his Conver&s;ation with the Profe&s;&s;ors of the Univer&s;ity, that they offered him his De|gree of Doctor in Philo&s;ophy, a Dignity cor|re&s;pondent
<PB N="17" REF="19">
to that of Ma&s;ter of Arts among us. <HI>Barretier</HI> drew up that Night fourteen Po&s;itions in Philo&s;ophy and the Mathematicks, which he &s;ent immediately to the Pre&s;s, and defended the next Day in a crowded Au|ditory, with &s;o much Wit, Spirit, Pre&s;ence of Thought, and Strength of Rea&s;on, that the whole Univer&s;ity was delighted and amaz'd; he was then admitted to his Degree, and at|tended by the whole Concour&s;e to his Lodg|ings, with Compliments and Acclamations.</P>
<P>His <HI>The&s;es,</HI> or philo&s;ophical Po&s;itions, which he printed in Compliance with the Practice of that Univer&s;ity, ran through &s;everal Editions in a few Weeks, and no Te&s;timony of Regard was wanting that could contribute to animate him in his Progre&s;s.</P>
<P>When they arrived at <HI>Berlin,</HI> the King or|dered him to be brought into his Pre&s;ence, and was &s;o much plea&s;ed with his Conver&s;a|tion, that he &s;ent for him almo&s;t every Day, during his &s;tay at <HI>Berlin;</HI> and diverted him|&s;elf with engaging him in Conver&s;ations on a Multitude of Subjects, and in Di&s;putes with learned Men, on all which Occa&s;ions he ac|quitted him&s;elf &s;o happily, that the King formed the highe&s;t Ideas of his Capacity and future Eminence.

Sphere of a great Genius, he recommended to him the Study of Modern Hi&s;tory, the Cu&s;toms of Nations, and tho&s;e Parts of Learn|ing, that are of U&s;e in publick Tran&s;actions and civil Employments, declaring that &s;uch Abilities properly cultivated, might exalt him, in ten Years, to be the greate&s;t Mini&s;ter of State in <HI>Europe. Barretier,</HI> whether we at|tribute it to his Moderation or Inexperience, was not dazzled by the Pro&s;pect of &s;uch high Promotion, but an&s;wered, that he was too much plea&s;ed with Science and Quiet, to leave them for &s;uch inextricable Studies, or &s;uch harra&s;&s;ing Fatigues. A Re&s;olution &s;o un|plea&s;ing to the King, that his Father attri|butes to it, the Delay of tho&s;e Favours which they had Hopes of receiving, the King having, as he ob&s;erves, determined to employ him in the Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>The Science that withheld him from com|plying with &s;uch flattering Propo&s;als, was A&s;tronomy, which was always his Fa|vourite Study, and &s;o much engro&s;&s;ed his Thoughts that he did not willingly con|ver&s;e on any other Subject; nor was he &s;o well plea&s;ed with the Civilities of the greate&s;t Per&s;ons, as with the Conver&s;ation of the Mathematicians. An A&s;tronomical Ob|&s;ervation was &s;ufficient to with-hold him from

Court, or to call him away abruptly from the mo&s;t illu&s;trious A&s;&s;emblies; none could hope to enjoy his Company long without inviting &s;ome Profe&s;&s;or to keep him in Tem|per, and engage him in Di&s;cour&s;e; nor was it po&s;&s;ible, without this Expedient, to prevail upon him to &s;it for his Picture.</P>
<P>It is not unlikely, that paternal Affection might &s;ugge&s;t to M. <HI>Barretier</HI> &s;ome fal&s;e Conceptions of the King's De&s;igns; for he infers from the Introduction of his Son to the young Princes, and the Care&s;&s;es which he received from them, that the King intended him for their Preceptor, a Scheme, &s;ays he, which &s;ome other Re&s;olution happily de|&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Whatever was originally intended, and by whatever Means the&s;e Intentions were fru|&s;trated; <HI>Barretier,</HI> after having been treated with the highe&s;t Regard by the whole Royal Family, was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with a Pre&s;ent of two hundred Crowns, and his Father, in&s;tead of being fixed at <HI>Stetin,</HI> was made Pa&s;tor of the <HI>French</HI> Church at <HI>Hall;</HI> a Place more com|modious for Study, to which they retired; <HI>Barretier</HI> being recommended by the King to the Univer&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="22">
As the Scene of M. <HI>Barretier</HI>'s Life was now changed, it &s;eems not improper to recur to &s;ome of the former Parts of it, and to re|count &s;ome Honours conferred upon him, which, if Di&s;tinctions are to be rated by the Knowledge of tho&s;e who be&s;tow them, may be con&s;idered as more valuable than tho&s;e which he received from Princes.</P>
<P>In <HI>June</HI> 1731, He was initiated in the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Altdorft,</HI> and at the End of the Year 1732, the Synod of the Reformed Churches, held at <HI>Chri&s;tian Erlang,</HI> admitted him to be pre&s;ent at their Con&s;ultations, and, to pre&s;erve the Memory of &s;o extraordinary a Tran&s;action, as the Reception of a Boy of eleven Years into an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Council, re|corded it in a particular Article of the Acts of the Synod.</P>
<P><HI>Barretier</HI> had been di&s;tingui&s;hed much more early by the Margravine of <HI>An&s;pach,</HI> who in 1726, &s;ent for his Father and Mother to the Court, where their Son, whom they carried with them, pre&s;ented her with a Letter in <HI>French,</HI> and addre&s;&s;ed another in <HI>Latin</HI> to the young Prince; who afterwards, in 1743, granted him the Privilege of borrowing Books from the Libraries of <HI>An&s;pach,</HI> toge|ther with an annual Pen&s;ion of fifty Florins, which he enjoyed for four Years.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="23">
M. <HI>Barretier</HI> returned on the 28th of <HI>April,</HI> 1735, to <HI>Hall,</HI> where he continued the remaining Part of his Life, of which it may not be improper to give a more particular Account.</P>
<P>At his Settlement in the Univer&s;ity, he de|termined to exert his Privileges as Ma&s;ter of Arts, and to read publick Lectures to the Students, a De&s;ign from which his Father could not di&s;&s;uade him, tho' he did not ap|prove it; &s;o certainly do Honours or Prefer|ments, too &s;oon conferred, infatuate the greate&s;t Capacities. He publi&s;hed an Invitation to three Lectures, one Critical on the Book of <HI>Job,</HI> a|nother on A&s;tronomy, and a third upon anci|ent Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory. But of this Em|ployment he was &s;oon made weary by the Pe|tulance of his Auditors, the Fatigue which it occa&s;ioned, and the Interruption of his Studies which it produced; and therefore, in a Fort|night, he de&s;i&s;ted wholly from his Lectures, and never afterwards re&s;umed them.</P>
<P>He then applied him&s;elf to the Study of the Law, almo&s;t again&s;t his own Inclination, which, however, he conquered &s;o far as to be|come a regular Attendant on the Lectures in that Faculty, but &s;pent all his other Time upon different Studies.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="24">
The fir&s;t Year of his Re&s;idence at <HI>Hall</HI> was &s;pent upon Natural Philo&s;ophy and Ma|thematicks; and &s;carcely any Author, ancient or modern, that has treated on tho&s;e Parts of Learning was neglected by him, nor was he &s;atisfied with the Knowledge of what had been di&s;covered by others, but made new Ob&s;erva|tions, and drew up immen&s;e Calculations for his own U&s;e.</P>
<P>He then returned to Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory, and began to retouch his <HI>Account of Here&s;ies,</HI> which he had begun at <HI>Schwobach;</HI> on this Occa&s;ion he read the Primitive Writers with great Accuracy, and formed a Project of re|gulating the Chronology of tho&s;e Ages; which produced a <HI>Chronological Di&s;&s;ertation on the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Bi&s;hops of</HI> Rome, <HI>from St</HI> Peter <HI>to</HI> Victor; printed in <HI>Latin</HI> at <HI>Utrecht,</HI> 1740.</P>
<P>He afterwards was wholly ab&s;orbed in Ap|plication to polite Literature, and read not only a Multitude of Writers in the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> but in the <HI>German, Dutch, French, Italian, Engli&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Arabick</HI> Languages, and, in the la&s;t Year of his Life, he was engro&s;&s;ed by the Study of In&s;criptions, Medals, and Antiquities of all Nations.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="25">
In 1737, he re&s;umed his De&s;ign of finding a certain Method of di&s;covering the Longi|tude, which he imagined him&s;elf to have at|tained by exact Ob&s;ervations of the Declina|tion and Inclination of the Needle, and &s;ent to the Academy of Sciences, and to the Royal Society of <HI>London</HI> at the &s;ame Time, an Ac|count of his Schemes; to which it was fir&s;t an|&s;wered by the Royal Society, that it appear'd the &s;ame with one that Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton</HI> had laid before them; and afterwards by the Academy of Sciences, that his Method was but very little different from one that had been propo&s;ed by M. <HI>de la Croix,</HI> and which was ingenious, but ineffectual.</P>
<P>M. <HI>Barretier</HI> finding his Invention already in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of two Men eminent for ma|thematical Knowledge, de&s;i&s;ted from all En|quiries after the Longitude, and engaged in an Examination of the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Antiqui|ties, which he propo&s;ed to free from their pre&s;ent Ob&s;curity, by deciphering their Hie|rogliphicks, and explaining their A&s;tronomy, but this De&s;ign was interrupted by his Death.</P>
<P>This De&s;ign he had propo&s;ed to him&s;elf, to execute in &s;uch a Manner, as &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h his Reputation; and, indeed, it appears from the Scheme which he &s;ent to M. <HI>Le</HI>

<P>He continued to add new Acqui&s;itions to his Learning, and to encrea&s;e his Reputation by new Performances, till in the Beginning of his nineteenth Year, his Health began to decline, and his Indi&s;po&s;ition, which being not alarming, or violent, was perhaps not at fir&s;t &s;ufficiently regarded, increa&s;ed by &s;low
<PB N="26" REF="28">
Degrees for eighteen Months, during which he &s;pent Days among his Books, and neither neglected his Studies, nor lo&s;t his Gaiety, till his Di&s;temper, ten Days before his Death, de|prived him of the U&s;e of his Limbs, he then prepared him&s;elf for his End, without Fear or Emotion, and on the 5th of <HI>October,</HI> 1740, re&s;igned his Soul into the Hands of his Savi|our, with Confidence and Tranquillity.</P>
<P>Thus died <HI>Barretier,</HI> in the 20th Year of his Age, having given a Proof how much may be performed in &s;o &s;hort a Time by indefati|gable Diligence. He was not only Ma&s;ter of many Languages, but skilled almo&s;t in every Science, and capable of di&s;tingui&s;hing him&s;elf in every Profe&s;&s;ion, except that of Phy&s;ick, from which he had been di&s;couraged by re|marking the Diver&s;ity of Opinions among tho&s;e who had been con&s;ulted concerning his own Di&s;orders.</P>
<P>His Learning, however va&s;t, had not de|pre&s;&s;ed or over-burthen'd his natural Facul|ties, for his Genius appeared always predomi|nant; and when he enquired into the various Opinions of the Writers of all Ages, he rea|&s;oned and determined for him&s;elf, having a Mind at once comprehen&s;ive and delicate, active and attentive. He was able to rea&s;on with the Metaphy&s;icians on the mo&s;t ab|&s;tru&s;e
<PB N="27" REF="29">
Que&s;tions, or to enliven the mo&s;t unplea|&s;ing Subjects by the Gaiety of his Fancy. He wrote with great Elegance and Dignity of Stile, and had the peculiar Felicity of Readi|ne&s;s and Facility in every Thing that he un|dertook, being able without Premeditation to tran&s;late one Language into another. He was no Imitator, but &s;truck out new Tracts, and formed original Sy&s;tems. He had a Quickne&s;s of Apprehen&s;ion, and Firmne&s;s of Memory, which enabled him to read with incredible Ra|pidity, and at the &s;ame Time to retain what he had read, &s;o as to be able to recollect and ap|ply it. He turned over Volumes in an In&s;tant, and &s;elected what was u&s;eful for his Purpo&s;e. He &s;eldom made Extracts, except of Books which he could not procure, when he might want them a &s;econd Time, being always able to find in any Author, with great Expedition, what he had once read. He read over, in one Winter, twenty va&s;t Folio's; and the catalogue of Books which he had borrow'd, compri&s;ed 41 Pages in Quarto, the Writing clo&s;e, and the Titles abridged. He was a con&s;tant Reader of Literary Journals.</P>
<P>With regard to common Life, he had &s;ome Peculiarities. He could not bear Mu&s;ick, and if he was ever engaged at Play, could not at|tend to it. He neither loved Wine nor Enter|tainments,
<PB N="28" REF="30">
nor Dancing, nor the Sports of the Field, nor relieved his Studies with any other Diver&s;ion than that of Walking and Con|ver&s;ation. He eat little Fle&s;h, and lived al|mo&s;t wholly upon Milk, Tea, Bread, Fruits, and Sweetmeats.</P>
<P>He had great Vivacity in his Imagination, and Ardour in his De&s;ires, which the ea&s;y Method of his Education had never repre&s;&s;ed, he therefore conver&s;ed among tho&s;e who had gained his Confidence with great Freedom; but his Favourites were not numerous, and to others he was always re&s;erved and &s;ilent, with|out the lea&s;t Inclination to di&s;cover his Senti|ments, or di&s;play his Learning. He never fixed his Choice upon any Employment, nor confined his Views to any Profe&s;&s;ion, being de&s;irous of nothing but Knowledge, and en|tirely untainted with Avarice or Ambition. He pre&s;erved him&s;elf always independent, and was never known to be guilty of a Lie. His con&s;tant Application to Learning &s;uppre&s;&s;ed tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions which betray others of his Age to Irregularities, and excluded all tho&s;e Temp|tations to which Men are expo&s;ed by Idlene&s;s, or common Amu&s;ements.</P>
