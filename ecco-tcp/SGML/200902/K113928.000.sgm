<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD>To the Revd. Mr. WARTON.</HEAD>
<P>SIR,</P>
<P>YOU will have no rea&s;on to be either alarmed or offended at a mode of addre&s;s, which every reader has a right to adopt. The author of a book upon a &s;ubject de&s;igned for and attractive of public attention gives a general challenge. If his facts and opinions &s;tand the te&s;t of a fair and candid enquiry, he is entitled to univer&s;al patronage and approbation: if not, contempt and oblivion &s;hould be his fate. The "History of Engli&s;h Poetry" &s;tands high in public estimation; the &s;ubject is equally curious, intere&s;ting, and ab&s;tru&s;e: much, very much, of its &s;ucce&s;s is, undoubtedly, to be a&s;cribed to the opinion generally entertained of your veracity and care as a historian; and upon an idea &s;o univer&s;al, &s;o &s;atisfactory, and hitherto &s;o undisturbed, it may &s;eem in|vidious not to have been content entirely to rely. I, however, Sir, am &s;ome|what too re&s;tle&s;s in my enquiries, too de&s;irous of being able to judge for my&s;elf, to be &s;atisfyed either with a writers reputation, or with the opinion of the world; at lea&s;t, when I have it in my power to learn how de&s;ervedly that reputation has been acquired, or how ju&s;tly that opinion is formed. In pur&s;uit of the&s;e objects, I have read and examined your great and important work with &s;ome degree of attention and accuracy; and I now pre&s;ent you with the re&s;ult of my enquiries: the public disclo&s;ure of which will not, I flatter my&s;elf, either to you, or your numerous readers, prove an unacceptable &s;ervice. If, in &s;ome few in&s;tances, I may be thought to have betrayed a warmth of expre&s;&s;ion, from which reputation &s;o high, abilities &s;o uncommon, and a profe&s;&s;ion &s;o &s;acred, ought to have been wholely exempt, let me, once for all, ob&s;erve, that, having no other object in view, no other end to an&s;wer, than truth and justice, I neither wi&s;h nor intend to con&s;ider you otherwi&s;e than as author of the work in question. Per&s;onal motives I cannot po&s;&s;ibly have been influenced by, and
<PB N="2" REF="4">utterly disavow. And were you able to fal&s;ify every charge I have here brought again&s;t you, whatever might be your &s;everity, I &s;hould ki&s;s the rod with re&s;ig|nation, and even plea&s;ure: as, I a&s;&s;ure you, the &s;atisfaction I &s;hould have ex|perienced, in finding your work entirely free from error, would have been in|finitely beyond any I can be &s;uppo&s;ed to feel, in thus making my&s;elf the public in&s;trument of its detection.</P>

<HEAD>VOL. I. </HEAD>
<P>Preface</P>
<P>Page vi.</P>
<P>That "&s;ome perhaps will be of opinion, that the&s;e annals ought to have commenced with a view of Saxon poetry," is a very natural and judicious conjecture. "The legitimate illustration of that jejune and intricate &s;ubject," would undoubtedly "have doubled 'your' labour," and required, I fear, a more profound and exten&s;ive erudition, as well as a more penetrating judge|ment, than were, perhaps, nece&s;&s;ary for the aera whence you have thought pro|per to deduce this important history. "That the Saxon language is familiar only to a few learned antiquaries, that our Saxon poems are little more than religious rhap&s;odies, and that &s;carce any compo&s;itions remain marked with the native images of that people in their pagan &s;tate <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">It may &s;eem a very extraordinary idea in a Christian minister, and who is not only the historian of poets, but a poet his&s;elf, that the&s;e people could not have a poetical genius, be|cau&s;e they were not pagans; and that religion and poetry are incompatible. The notion, however &s;trange, may yet in &s;ome degree be ju&s;t: The Saxons, like many other nations, really &s;eem to have got very little "by the <HI>&s;wop.</HI>"</NOTE>, we will readyly allow; becau&s;e, admitting the po&s;itions to be true, they prove nothing; they are per|fectly harmle&s;s: But, "that the Saxon poetry has NO CONNECTION with the nature and purpo&s;e of 'your' PRESENT UNDERTAKING," is an a&s;&s;ertion, one may &s;afely venture to &s;ay, as new as it is ill-grounded, and full of mischief. Though the great revolution produced by the Norman invaders effected "that &s;ignal change in our policy, con&s;titution, and public manners," which has in its con&s;equences "reached modern times," yet neither the Saxon people nor the Saxon tongue was thereby eradicated. You, Sir, have &s;ometimes been a blographer; and did you ever find it nece&s;&s;ary to commence the &s;tory of your hero at the 15th or 16th year of his age, and to a&s;&s;ert that the time of his birth and infancy had no connection with the &s;tory of his life, becau&s;e, for&s;ooth, he was become a very different per&s;on when grown up and &s;ent to college, from what he was when born, breeched, and &s;ent to &s;chool? And yet one may well doubt, whether &s;uch an apology would not have an&s;wered your purpo&s;e ju&s;t as effectually in that ca&s;e, as your rea&s;on for declining to enter upon the &s;tate of
<PB N="3" REF="5">the Saxon poetry does in this. The truth is, that the origin and fundamental principles, as well of our language as of our poetry, are to be &s;ought for among the remains of the Saxon literature <NOTE N="(2)" PLACE="foot">You admit this by the very fir&s;t page of your history; you doubtle&s;s perceived your in|con&s;istency, though you did not, I &s;uppo&s;e, expect that any of your readers would do &s;o.</NOTE>; and he who &s;hall tell us that the Engli&s;h and Saxon languages have not &s;ort of connection with each other, is either de|ceived his&s;elf, or finds it his intere&s;t to deceive others,&mdash;by &s;heltering his own ignorance or inactivity under a formidable and laboured &s;hew of difficulty and u&s;ele&s;sne&s;s, equally vi&s;ionary, delu&s;ive, and pernicious.</P>
<P>P. viii.</P>
<P>Whether you have gratifyed "the reader of ta&s;te," by your exertions on this &s;ubject, I know not; but of this I am confident, that "the anti|quarian" will have greater rea&s;on to be dis&s;atisfyed with being perplexed or misled, than to thank you for having engaged in a ta&s;k for which it will appear you have been &s;o little qualifyed.</P>
<P>I &s;hall pa&s;s by the two di&s;&s;ertations which precede your history without ob&s;ervation <NOTE N="(3)" PLACE="foot">You have &s;omewhere ob&s;erved, that we have a kind of malicious plea&s;ure in detecting the &s;ecret re&s;ources and petty thefts of a great writer; and the remark is ju&s;t and natural, with re&s;pect to the plea&s;ure; which does not, I tru&s;t, &s;o much re&s;ult from malice, as from a &s;ecret re|gard to truth, and an indignant warmth at &s;eeing the daw &s;trut abroad in his &s;tolen plumes. Whatever may be the cau&s;e, I &s;hall in the cour&s;e of this enquiry have many opportunities or proving the justice of the ob&s;ervation. And, fir&s;tly, you will be plea&s;ed to take notice, that the greate&s;t and be&s;t part of your note <HI>(t)</HI> (Di&s;. I. &s;ign. a. 4. <HI>b.</HI>) in which you, with an equal parade of ingenuity and learning, account for an interpolation, by Geoffrey of Monmouth, into his translation of the Briti&s;h history, has been found to be almo&s;t literally <HI>borrowed</HI> from Mr. Cartes preface to the fir&s;t vol. of his History of England. I have likewi&s;e &s;ome little rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, though I do not think worth my while to prove, that you owe more obligation to Sheltons translation of Wottons View of Dr. Hickeses The&s;aurus, than to the The&s;aurus its&s;elf.</NOTE>; not that I think them altogether ju&s;t and proper, but becau&s;e I find that a &s;trict examination would require greater lei&s;ure, and more inten&s;e application, as well as a more frequent reference to the numerous and uncom|mon books there quoted (many of which I have, by the way, much rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect you never con&s;ulted, nor even ever &s;aw) than I am at pre&s;ent either wil|ling or able to devote to it. I do not, at the &s;ame time, wi&s;h to detract from whatever merit you may have in this ingenious &s;tructure: I onely de&s;ire the reader to be particularly cautious and distru&s;tful, as he wanders over the&s;e ex|ten&s;ive regions of FABLE and ROMANCE. One may, however, venture to a&s;&s;ert, that, let your facts and rea&s;onings in the fir&s;t of the&s;e di&s;&s;ertations be ever &s;o ju&s;t, yet will they by no means prove any thing like what you produce them for,&mdash;the introduction of romantic fiction into Europe; which is rather to be &s;ought for in the history of the Gauls, or other Celtic nations, who were &s;ettled
<PB N="4" REF="6">in Europe &s;ome thou&s;and years before you &s;uppo&s;e the Goths to have arrived in this part of the world, and had doubtle&s;s "a very &s;ufficient &s;tock of lies of their own growth <NOTE N="(4)" PLACE="foot">Tyrwhitt <HI>ver&s;us</HI> Warburton. Supplement to Shak&s;peare, i. 373.</NOTE>," without being beholden to A&s;iatic adventurers.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not give my&s;elf the trouble to minute <HI>every</HI> inaccuracy I might dis|cover in the citations you have introduced from the old metrical legends, be|tween your 7th and 26th page: I take it for granted they are ju&s;t as correct as I &s;hall prove others to be, which you have given from MSS. in the Cotton and Harleian libraries; many of which, as one may ea&s;yly perceive, by your method of quoting, referring to, or registering them, you have certainly never &s;een.</P>
<P>P. 26.</P>
<P>One cannot help taking notice of your frequent forewardne&s;s in deter|mining the age of poetical compo&s;itions, or the MSS. which contain them. In this page you produce a love-&s;ong, the olde&s;t you can discover, which you "would place before or about the year 1200." This you cite from a MS. appearing, as you el&s;ewhere <NOTE N="(5)" PLACE="foot">P. 28.</NOTE> tell us, to be of the hand-writing of the reign of king Edward the fir&s;t: but <HI>an Elegy upon his</HI> DEATH, which you have printed, in another place <NOTE N="(6)" PLACE="foot">P. 103.</NOTE>, from this very MS. might have &s;erved to &s;hew you the ab|&s;urdity of dating it in his LIFE-TIME. The truth is, the book evidently ap|pears to have been written in the reign of his &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and there is not the lea&s;t rea&s;on for concluding any poem in it to be much older than the year 1300.</P>
<P>The Revd. Dr. Percy (now lord bi&s;hop of Dromore), who&s;e knowlege in the&s;e matters &s;eems pretty much upon a level with your own, has brought its age down &s;o low as the reign of king Richard II. <NOTE N="(7)" PLACE="foot">Reliques of Ancient Poetry, ii. 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>I cannot, willingly, dismi&s;s this &s;ame love-&s;ong, without giving a &s;pecimen or two of the extreme correctne&s;s with which it is printed, and the extreme pro|priety with which it is explained.</P>
<P>"With lokkes lefliche and longe." <HI>Lefliche,</HI> you &s;ay, is "lively;" and a mo&s;t curious explanation to be &s;ure it is! The <HI>lively locks</HI> of a young lady! Charming creature! &s;he mu&s;t have been a perfect Medu&s;a! But, po&s;&s;ibly, you mistook <HI>lokkes</HI> for <HI>looks;</HI> and then we have the <HI>lively and</HI> long <HI>looks</HI> of the &s;aid fair one! If this famous history of yours &s;hould have the great and unmerited good fortune to come to a &s;econd edition, you will do well to &s;ubtract one fault, by correcting <HI>lively</HI> to <HI>lovely;</HI> and another, by writing <HI>lure lumes</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>bire limmes:</HI> for though old poetry may be the &s;ame thing to you, &s;en&s;e or non&s;en&s;e, it may not be &s;o to every one who is tempted to look into your book. The great blank, a few lines
<PB N="5" REF="7">further, you may fill up with the little word <HI>wes:</HI> but, indeed, you would do much better to get a fre&s;h tran&s;cript, as there are fifty other mistakes in the copy you have printed: and all the re&s;t of the extracts from this and every other MS. throughout the volume, and indeed the whole work, are in the &s;ame predicament. It would, moreover, be as well, not to call the ver&s;es be|ginning "Hyrdmen [hem] hatieth ant vch mones hyne," a different ballad from that on the lawyers; as, had you in&s;pected the MS. in&s;tead of the catalogue, you would have found both to be one and the &s;ame piece.</P>
<P>P. 43, 44, 45, 46.</P>
<P>We are here favoured with a &s;atyrical ballad upon Richard king of the Romans, brother to our Henry III. pre&s;erved in the above MS. which you, in a note, tell us you "had tran&s;cribed from the Briti&s;h Mu|&s;eum, and written the explanations upon, BEFORE 'you' knew that it was printed in the SECOND [FIRST] edition of Doctor Percy's Ballads."&mdash;Now, Mr. Warton, li&s;ten to me for a &s;ingle moment, and <HI>"mark how a plain tale &s;hall put you down."</HI> Dr. (now Bp.) Percy, in printing this &s;ong, has taken &s;ome liberties with the orthography and language (and where is the piece with which he has not taken &s;uch liberties?) in particular, he has altered the word <HI>cop</HI> <NOTE N="(8)" PLACE="foot"><P>"Sire Simond de Montfort hath &s;uore by ys <HI>cop," i. e.</HI> cap or head. Thus, in the ancient Erench romance of Girart de Vienne, MS.</P>
<P>&THORN; mon <HI>cap</HI> di&s;t. G. men uoil gardar.</P></NOTE>, which he did <HI>not</HI> under&s;tand, to <HI>fot,</HI> which, it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed, he <HI>did.</HI> In this alteration, and indeed throughout the whole poem, YOU, Mr. Warton, have followed him with a mo&s;t literal and &s;ervile exactne&s;s. Still, however, you might have e&s;caped undetected, and have pilfered "your ingenious friend and fellow-labourer" with &s;afety; but, unluckyly, his lord&s;hips accuracy, being much of a piece with your own, &s;uffered him to omit a complete &s;tanza; which could not po&s;&s;ibly have eluded the ob&s;ervation of a &s;econd copyi&s;t: but I look in vain for it in YOUR (different) tran&s;cript. However, as it may be &s;ome &s;mall con&s;olation to you in this unfortunate dilemma, I will here give it you.</P>

This omi&s;&s;ion of the ingenious prelate is the more a&s;toni&s;hing, not onely as the ver&s;e immediately follows what he has copyed, but becau&s;e Mr. Wanley &s;ays, in his catalogue, that the &s;ong expre&s;sly mentions prince Edward, which it onely does in this ver&s;e <NOTE N="(9)" PLACE="foot">At p. 103, is another poem [the Elegy on Ed.

<P>I &s;hall make no remark on the obvious wonder of your forgetting the prin|cipal contents of a book, from which you are continually quoting pa&s;&s;ages&mdash;as your own; a favour, indeed, that many writers have to acknowlege, be&s;ide his lord&s;hip of Dromore.</P>

<P>No one, I &s;incerely believe, except your&s;elf, could have &s;uppo&s;ed, for a moment, that the name of HENGIST de&s;erved the &s;lighte&s;t attention, in giving the etymology of the word STONEHENGE:&mdash;than which nothing can be more &s;imple and apparent; as it is communicated by the word its&s;elf: <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>hanging &s;tone.</HI></P>

<P>It is no ballad; and the reference would have been ju&s;t as ea&s;y, and much more u&s;eful, to Hearnes HEMINGI CHARTULARIUM, p. 663. Whence, I dare lay my life, you had your information.</P>

<P>It may not be improper, once for all, to warn the reader, that you interpret every where at random; and not becau&s;e you perfectly under&s;tand, but becau&s;e you are entirely ignorant of, the word you pretend to explain. I mu&s;t, how|ever, do you the justice to except a variety of words, to which you have affixed
<PB N="7" REF="9">the proper meanings, where the mere&s;t &s;chool-boy could not have been at a lo&s;s for them: and for the multitude of really difficult ones which you have left untouched, your readers owe you infinite obligations.</P>
<P>P. 68.</P>
<P>Poor old Cotgrave is here attacked for, what you call, ab&s;urdly interpreting <HI>mangoneau</HI> (<HI>magnel</HI> in your text) <HI>an old-fa&s;hioned &s;ling.</HI> You, indeed, &s;ay, "it is a <HI>catapult</HI> or <HI>battering ram</HI> <NOTE N="(10)" PLACE="foot">I ob&s;erve, that this ingenious explication is, with many other blunders, of greater and le&s;s con&s;equence, afterwards directed to be de&s;troyed. You &s;hould, however, have de&s;troyed it your&s;elf. It would not, &s;urely, be a &s;ufficient atonement for the impudence or ignorance of a writer, who&s;e work was one continued mistake, to direct his readers to&mdash;<HI>dele</HI> the whole. You will not, however, have many &s;imilar in&s;tances of hard&s;hip to complain of.</NOTE>." But, pray, Mr. Warton, who told you &s;o? or where did you learn that a <HI>catapult</HI> was the &s;ame thing as a <HI>battering ram?</HI> Cotgrave undoubtedly knew a thou&s;and million times more of the matter than you can do: and, to prove that you know nothing at all about it, let me intreat you to read your own text; you will there find that the <HI>magnels</HI> were to be u&s;ed by people UPON the wall, again&s;t tho&s;e who came to a&s;&s;ail it. Was that the place and u&s;e of a <HI>battering ram?</HI> The very pa&s;&s;age &s;hews Cotgrave to be right: and his explanation is further confirmed by a line at p. 72, where, though the word <HI>magneles</HI> is joined with <HI>&s;linges,</HI> and evidently &s;ignifies &s;ome|thing of the &s;ame nature, you have the confidence to refer the reader to the above non&s;en&s;e at p. 68.</P>

<P>"Sir Robert of Malton.

<P>"<HI>Vuel</HI> thing;" "well, good." P. 82. "<HI>Vuel</HI> thing;" "Vile."</P>
<P>Such &s;en&s;ible people, Mr. Warton, as your&s;elf, generally take care to be very con&s;istent. Is a <HI>good</HI> thing a <HI>vile</HI> one?</P>
<P>P. 110.</P>
<P>"Before the&s;e expeditions into the Ea&s;t became fa&s;hionable, the prin|cipal and leading &s;ubjects of the old fablers were the atchievements of king
<PB N="8" REF="10">Arthur with his knights of the round table, and of Charlemagne with his twelve peers. But in the romances written after the holy war, a new &s;et of champions, of conque&s;ts and of countries, were introduced. Trebizonde took place of Rouncevalles, and Godfrey of Bulloigne, Solyman, Nouraddin, the caliphs, the &s;ouldans, and the cities of Aegypt and Syria, became the favourite topics."</P>
<P>And now, Mr. Warton, after this very &s;ublime Ea&s;tern flight, let me a&s;k, for I dare &s;ay many of your readers would be glad to know, what time you are plea&s;ed to call the fa&s;hionable aera of the Cru&s;ade. Was it when Godfrey cap|tured Jeru&s;alem in 1099? or when Richard I. planted the Engli&s;h &s;tandard upon the walls of Acon in 1191? If the fir&s;t, you will, I am afrayed, be at a lo&s;s to produce a &s;ingle romance upon the &s;ubject of king Arthur, of Charlemagne, or of Roncesvalles. If the &s;econd, then I am to enquire where a romance is to be found, any way near that age, or, indeed, of any other, which treats of Tre|bizond, independent of the history of Charlemagne? and, excepting, perhaps, a book or two of the acts of Godfrey and Baldwin, where are the&s;e favourite romances of Solyman, Nouraddin, the caliphs, the &s;oldans, Egypt, and Syria, which cut &s;uch a pompous figure in the above extract? Shall I like|wi&s;e give you the trouble to recollect your authority for making the whole body of the troubadours of Provence take up arms, and follow their barons, "in prodigious multitudes," to the conque&s;t of Jeru&s;alem? That &s;ome few of the&s;e poets, in the &s;ervice and courts of princes, &s;hould be permitted to accom|pany their lords to the cru&s;ade, and that others, of inferior rank, might enter into and mix with the army, may be, and I fancy is, very true: but that a &s;ingle province &s;hould, at that or any other time, contain &s;uch <HI>prodigious multitudes</HI> of itinerant min&s;trels, is an a&s;&s;ertion as hypothetic and in&s;upportable, as it is in|credible and ab&s;urd.

<P>"The &s;tory of Patient Gri&s;ilde was the invention of Boccacio." Hardyly and boldly a&s;&s;erted.&mdash;Blind Bayard never he&s;itates at a leap. From the circum&s;tance of there being every rea&s;on to conclude that Boccace was NOT the author of this &s;tory, you very rationally conclude he WAS. In the year 1373 (and not 1374) the Decameron fell into the hands of Petrarch, who tells Boccace, in a letter, he was &s;o much affected with this tale, that he had trans|lated it into Latin; adding, that it had always plea&s;ed him <HI>when he had heard
<PB N="14" REF="16">it many years before</HI> <NOTE N="(19)" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Tyrwhitts Chaucer, iv. 157.</NOTE>; a &s;ufficient proof that Boccace was not the author. And it would, indeed, appear very &s;trange, if Petrarch had not payed his friend &s;ome compliment upon the invention of &s;o intere&s;ting a &s;tory, if he had not been fully appri&s;ed that it was <HI>not</HI> HIS. Be&s;ides, it is well enough known that this is far from being the onely tale in the Decameron, of which Boccace was not the in|ventor. The fable of Chaucers interview with Petrarch having been ju&s;tly exploded and given up by every other per&s;on, YOU are now "inclined to think that he (Chaucer) was one of tho&s;e friends to whom Petrarch u&s;ed to relate it (<HI>i. e.</HI> the &s;tory of Gri&s;ilde) at Padua;" and "this," you &s;ay, "&s;eems &s;uf|ficiently pointed out in the words of the prologue;" becau&s;e the Clerk of Ox|enford, who tells the &s;tory, there &s;ays, that HE "lernid it at 'Padow of <HI>this</HI> worthie clerke." A mo&s;t convincing and &s;atisfactory circum&s;tance truely! But Petrarch does not inform us that he ever u&s;ed to relate the &s;tory to his friends at Padua, or anywhere el&s;e: he onely &s;ays, he had &s;hewn his translation of it to one of them: and from this ver&s;ion, which would, mo&s;t probably, be longer and more circum&s;tantial than Boccacios (and if you think proper, you have it in your power to compare them) there can be little doubt that Chaucer took the &s;tory, believing it to be Petrarchs own, and knowing it was not Boccacios.</P>

<P>"John Scogan is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed to have been a cotemporary of Chaucer, but this is a mistake. He was educated at Oriel college in Oxford; and being an excellent mimic, and of great plea&s;antry in conver&s;ation, be|came the favourite buffoon of the court of Edward the fourth, in which he pa&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t part of his life." You could &s;carcely have give the gen|tleman a more particular de&s;cription, if you had enjoyed the plea&s;ure of a <HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</HI> with him. But where is your authority for it? Marry, in "SCOGGINS JESTS;" an admirable &s;ource, truely, to draw the history of a mans life from. So may the lives of Foote, Garrick, and Sir John Fielding, be compiled, by &s;ome future Warton, from the je&s;t-books extant under their re|&s;pective names. But let us examine the account. This Scogan, or Scoggin, it &s;eems was a buffoon in the court of Edward the fourth: how, then, came Fal&s;taff to break his head, "at the court gate, when he was a crack not thus high;" this was in John of Gaunts time, when Jack "was page to Thomas Mowbray, duke of Norfolk <NOTE N="(22)" PLACE="foot">2d pt. of Hen. IV. a. iii. &s;c. 1.</NOTE>" O! this no doubt, you will &s;ay, is Shak|&s;peares own anachroni&s;m. Ben Jon&s;on, however, who was as likely to know the fact as you are, expre&s;sly tells us that Scogan was
<Q><L>&mdash; a fine gentleman, and a ma&s;ter of arts</L>
<L>Of HENRY THE FOURTHS times, that made disgui&s;es</L>

And this &s;eems to be true; for we have a <HI>moral balade royal</HI> from "Scogan, unto the lordes and gentlemen of the kynges hou&s;e," and which mu&s;t, as you ob&s;erve, have been written before the year 1447 (meaning, I &s;uppo&s;e, 1412) in his old age, and printed, as you your&s;elf tell us, by Caxton, who was, doubtle&s;s, &s;ufficiently acquainted with his identity and character; and there is, likewi&s;e, another from Chaucer to him.

It is not unlikely, however, (to allow you all po&s;&s;ible ju&s;tice) that, in thus &s;umming up his character in two words, you had your eye upon the following ingenious compo&s;ition, which he wrote at Oxford, on taking his degree of A.

For a little enquiry or attention mu&s;t have informed you, that the true name of the poet Scogan was HENRY, and not JOHN. This Mr. Tyrwhitt has clearly &s;hewn, and thence (perhaps rather too ha&s;tyly) inferred that the &s;tory of Scogan the je&s;ter was an ab&s;urd and improbable fiction; nay, he has even (contrary to his u&s;ual candour) gone &s;o far as to call the je&s;t-book, of which you have &s;o exalted an opinion, "a collection of <HI>fooli&s;h</HI> &s;tories." The merits of the work I &s;hall leave to be &s;ettled between your&s;elves; but this really learned and ingenious gentleman will not, I tru&s;t, take it ami&s;s, if I &s;hall venture to a&s;&s;ert, that there <HI>actually was</HI> &s;uch a per&s;on as JOHN SCOGAN; a totally distinct character from Henry, the poet; and who, though no "jocular bard," (unle&s;s you will allow the extract in the note &s;ufficient to authori&s;e the title) mu&s;t, in my mind, have been "a fellow of infinite je&s;t, of mo&s;t excellent fancy." I do not, in forming this opinion, rely altogether upon your friend Dr. Andrew Borde; though it will appear, that the account given by him is not entirely void of probability <NOTE N="(25)" PLACE="foot">This writer informs us, he had "heard &s;ay, that Scogin did come of an hone&s;t &s;tock, no kindred, and that his friends did &s;et him to &s;choole at Oxford, where he did continue till he was made master of art." He appears, from the book, to have been dead before Henry the &s;evenths time.

<P>"That time that Scogin was conver&s;ant, both in the kings chamber, and in the quens, Scogin would peak here and there, about in the queens chamber or lodging; the queen by custom (as mo&s;t commonly all great women and ladies and gentlewomen do) let a fart, &s;aying.

<P>The &s;tory immediately preceding, "How Scogin played hor&s;e-play in the queens chamber," is &s;till more "vnciuill."</P>

Secondly, here is his EPITAPH, tran&s;cribed from an authentic MS. in the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum <NOTE N="(27)" PLACE="foot">MSS. Harl. 1587.

With re&s;pect to its containing any fiction of Arabian romance, you &s;hould, I think, fir&s;t adduce &s;ome &s;uch romance, containing &s;imilar fictions with the Seven Champions, which is a mere olio from Guy, Bevis, and other old Eng|li&s;h romances and &s;tory-books.</P>

<P>"About the year 1512, MARTIN COCCCAIE of Mantua, who&s;e true name was THEOPHILO FOLENGIO, a Benedictine monk of Ca&s;ino in Italy, wrote a&mdash;burle&s;que Latin poem, in heroic metre, checquered with ITALIAN and TUSCAN words." This is, &s;urely, the mo&s;t curious pa&s;&s;age that was ever yet found in a history! Any other per&s;on than your&s;elf would have na|turally &s;uppo&s;ed that a non-existent character could not have written a book; and, if he had &s;ayed any thing, would have told his readers that &s;uch a one, under &s;uch an a&s;&s;umed name, did &s;o and &s;o. But it &s;eems to be your chief &s;tudy (if you &s;tudy at all) to court ab&s;urdity, rather than to avoid it: Here being no le&s;s than three choice blunders in little more than &s;o many lines. For, in the fir&s;t place, the a&s;&s;umed name of the aobve writer not MARTIN, but MERLIN, Coccaie. 2dly. His true one was not <HI>Theophilo</HI> FOLENGIO, but

<P>"For the purpo&s;e of ascertaining or illustrating the age of pieces which have been lately, or will be &s;oon produced, I here &s;top to recall the readers attention to the poetry and language of the la&s;t (<HI>&s;ci.</HI> the 15th) century, by exhibiting &s;ome extracts from the manu&s;cript romance of YWAIN and GAWAIN, which has &s;ome great outlines of Gothic painting, and appears to have been written in the reign of HENRY THE SIXTH.

<P>How mode&s;t! how ingenuous!&mdash;But, indeed, I ought to apologi&s;e for this and the other long extracts I have taken the liberty of producing from your celebrated history; however, as the mode has been adopted, rather for the &s;ake of giving you fair play, and doing you SUBSTANTIAL JUSTICE, than with a view to injure the rapid &s;ale of the work, you will, I flatter my&s;elf, have no inclination to be displea&s;ed at it.

What would any of Mr. Humes readers have thought of him, if in the middle of Henry the eighths reign he had <HI>&s;topped to recall their attention</HI> to a new history of the reign of Henry the &s;ixth?

That which you affect "to pre|mi&s;e," with re&s;pect to the language having received no improvement between the two periods, is a glaring incon&s;istency.

<P>"It is highly probable, that the metrical romances of RICHARD CUER DE LYON, GUY EARL OF WARWICK, and SYR BEVYS OF SOUTHAMPTON, were moderni&s;ed in this reign (<HI>&s;ci.</HI> that of Hen. VIII.) from more antient and &s;imple narrations." This ingenious conjecture comes, to be &s;ure, with perfect con|&s;istency from one who has already produced large extracts from the&s;e very poems, as &s;pecimens of the compo&s;ition of Edward the &s;econds time. But, ingenious as it is, it contains neither probability nor truth. All the above romances are extant in MSS. above 300 years old; and, one of them, at lea&s;t, (Sir Bevis) excepting the typographical incorrectne&s;s of the old printed copy, differs no otherwi&s;e from it than in its orthography, and the &s;light variations in&s;eparable from repeated tran&s;cription. The ancient MS. copy of <HI>Richard Cuer de Lion</HI> is as long, at lea&s;t, as, if not longer than, the old <HI>editions:</HI> but whether the printed copies agree with the MSS. or not, is a matter of very little con&s;e|quence to your hypothe&s;is. It is a fact, that &s;ome MS. copies are &s;o totally different from each other, as not to have two lines in common; being trans|lations from the French by different hands. This is actually the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to SIR GUY: there are two di&s;tinct translations, both very old; one of which is, line for line, the &s;ame with the printed copy. But it will not be found that the phra&s;eology or &s;tile is more poli&s;hed, or the &s;tory more am|plifyed or intricate, in the editions, than they are in the MSS. Simplicity, indeed, is a fault, of which few people will have rea&s;on to complain in the peru&s;al of an old metrical romance, let its antiquity be what it may. I &s;hall

<P>Although you tell us you have &s;een a fragment of the book whence.

The&s;e &s;u&s;picions were not weakened on finding, by a compari&s;on of you and your authority, that &s;ayed carol and colophon were printed with your u&s;ual accuracy. But, upon fur|ther reflection, I am half inclined to question the justice of the above &s;u&s;|picions; for it rather &s;eems to me, that you have been, on this occa&s;ion, GUILTY OF PRIVATELY STEALING&mdash;from YOURSELF. And I'll tell you how. In that very humourous trifle, intitled and called, "A COMPANION TO THE GUIDE, AND A GUIDE TO THE COMPANION," I &s;ee that you have in&s;erted the whole of Mr. Hearnes account <HI>verbatim,</HI> and with a circum&s;tance which might, el&s;ewhere, have been more to your honour:&mdash;you have given a minute and accurate reference to your real authority. I &s;ay <HI>el&s;ewhere;</HI> for it is, in this place, done merely with a view to rai&s;e a laugh at the expence of that mo&s;t worthy and re&s;pectable antiquary; whom, I rather think, you have, in the above piece, made &s;omewhat too-many attempts to ridicule; forgetting, perhaps, that though he was le&s;s poli&s;hed in his ta&s;te, and le&s;s elegant in his diction than &s;ome more modern writers, few, if any of them, can boa&s;t of &s;uch a &s;acred regard to truth, and of &s;uch unimpeached integrity. And what|ever his errors are, there is one, in which I wi&s;h you had imitated him as &s;ucce&s;sfully as you have done in many others of a le&s;s important and com|mendable nature:&mdash;he has never been detected in a wilful fal&s;ehood; nor been ever charged with the &s;lighte&s;t misrepre&s;entation of the minute&s;t fact.</P>
<P>Le&s;t the number and uniformity of the&s;e dry expostulations &s;hould render them too flat and tedious to your&s;elf, or my other gentle readers, I &s;hall make bold to break the chain, and endeavour to enliven you and them with an old Chri&s;tmas carol upon bringing up the BOARS HEAD, very different from that printed by Wynken de Worde, and now, for the fir&s;t time, faithfully publi&s;hed from an ancient MS. in my own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>A great deal has been &s;ayed about Marlow, his opinions and exit, from age to age; from Beard to Warton: the olde&s;t writers ("prejudiced and peevi&s;h puritans") directly arraigning him of athei&s;m and blasphemy; and tho&s;e of more modern times (pious and orthodox churchmen) generously labouring to re&s;cue his character; either by boldly denying, or artfully extenuating the crimes alledged again&s;t him: but not an <HI>iota</HI> of evidence has been produced on either &s;ide.

<P>"Among Mr. Oldys's books was the "Life of Sir Meliado <HI>a Britti&s;h knight,</HI>" translated from the Italian, in 1572. By the way, we are not here to &s;uppo&s;e that BRITTISH means ENGLISH. A BRITTISH knight means a knight of BRETAGNE or BRITANNY, in France. This is a common mistake, ari&s;ing from an equivocation which has converted many a French knight into an Engli&s;hman. The learned Nicholas Antonio, in his SPANISH LIBRARY, <HI>affords a remarkable example of this confu&s;ion,</HI> and a <HI>proof of its frequency,</HI> where he is &s;peaking of the Spani&s;h translation of the romance of TIRANTE THE WHITE, in 1480. <Q>Ad fabularum artificem &s;tylum convertimus, Joannem Martorell Valentiae regni civem, cujus e&s;t liber hujus commatis, TIRANT LE BLANCH in&s;criptus, atque anno 1480, ut aiunt, Valentiae in folio editus. <HI>More hic aliorum talium otio&s;orum con&s;ueto,</HI> fingit &s;e librum ex ANGLICA in Lu&s;itanam, deinde Lu&s;itana in Valentinam linguam, anno, 1460, trans|tuli&s;&s;e,

Antonio does not a&s;&s;ert, that the book was ACTUALLY PRINTED at Valencia in that year; he onely &s;ays, IT WAS REPORTED SO: And the report was fal&s;e.</NOTE> in 1480. This writer, according to a practice common to &s;uch idle historians, pretends he translated this book from Engli&s;h into Portugueze, and from thence into the Valencian language.</Q> The hero is a <HI>gentleman</HI> of BRE|TAGNE, and the book was FIRST WRITTEN IN THE LANGUAGE OF THAT COUNTRY. I take this opportunity of ob&s;erving, that <HI>the&s;e mistakes</HI> of ENG|LAND for BRITANNY, <HI>tend to confirm</HI> MY HYPOTHESIS, that Bretagne, or Ar|morica, was antiently a copious &s;ource of romance: an hypothe&s;is, which I have the happine&s;s to find was the opinion of the mo&s;t learned and ingenious M. La Croze. <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;(p. 447.) "OUR KING ARTHUR was &s;ometimes called ARTHUR of LITTLE BRITTAYNE, and there is a romance with that title, re|printed in 1609."</P>
<P>I trouble you, Mr. Warton, with this long extract, becau&s;e it is &s;o very in|tere&s;ting, and I have &s;uch a great deal to &s;ay to you upon it, that nothing le&s;s, perhaps, would have an&s;wered either your purpo&s;e or mine.</P>
<P>Though I never met with the "LIFE OF SIR MELIADO," nor with any other notice of it, I mu&s;t be content to &s;uppo&s;e it to have actually been where you &s;ay it was. But you ought, certainly, to have been better acquainted with it before you had &s;o peremptoryly decided upon the meaning of the word "BRITTISH," which, with equal ab&s;urdity and pre&s;umption, you would con|fine to BRETAGNE or Britany in France. To be &s;ure, you are rather got into your Iri&s;h &s;tile when you attempt to prove that BRITISH does NOT mean ENG|LISH, as no one, I believe, excepting your&s;elf, could po&s;&s;ibly have imagined that it did. It is, at the &s;ame time, very curious, to find a per&s;on, who either is, or pretends to be, a &s;cholar, hardyly contending that this country was never called BRITAIN, nor its inhabitants BRITISH! That the &s;un gives no light, and the night brings no darkne&s;! The notion is, in the utmo&s;t degree, con|temptible and ab&s;urd. Armorica was by the French called LA PETITE BRE|TAGNE, by us, LITTLE BRITAIN, merely to distingui&s;h it from the iland of GREAT BRITAIN, by the &s;tiled LA GRANDE BRETAGNE. The name BRITISH <HI>may,</HI> for aught I know, be common to both countries, but I firmly believe the inhabitants of BRITANY were never &s;o called, much le&s;s <HI>distingui&s;hed,</HI> by any writer, Engli&s;h of foreign, before the &s;agacious Mr. Warton <NOTE N="(52)" PLACE="foot">If there be any &s;uch book as "The Life of Sir Meliado," it is, without doubt, the romance of MELIADUS DE LEONNOIS, a petty king in GREAT BRITAIN, and one of the knights of the Round Table; who&s;e &s;tory was translated out of French into Italian, and printed at Venice in 1558 and 1559, in two volumes octavo.</NOTE>. But, let the word BRITISH mean what it will, how does it connect with or apply to the quotation from Nicholas Antonio? He &s;ays nothing at all about BRITISH; he expre&s;ly tells us, that Martorell pretended to have translated the romance of Tirante, "EX ANGLICA," out of ENGLISH. I have not, in the whole
<PB N="45" REF="47">cour&s;e of this &s;trange history, been a&s;toni&s;hed at any-thing more than at your a&s;&s;ertion that "the hero is a gentleman of BRETAGNE." Becau&s;e I can onely conclude it to be a gue&s;s; and it happens to be as lucky as it was bold. You are not quite &s;o fortunate, however, in your equally dog|matical po&s;ition, that "the book was FIRST WRITTEN IN THE LANGUAGE OF THAT COUNTRY:" than which nothing can be more in&s;upportable, more ill-grounded, or more fal&s;e. I mu&s;t, indeed, confe&s;s, that it was not without rea&s;on you concluded every one to be as ignorant about the mat|ter as your&s;elf; and that you might &s;afely advance whatever you cho&s;e without the &s;malle&s;t fear of detection. But, alas! how mi&s;erably have you been deceived! John or Joanot Martorell, the author of the above romance of TIRANT LO BLANCH (which, by the way, was not printed at Valencia in 1480, but at Barcelona in 1497, and no where el&s;e during the 15th century) in his dedication thereof to Don Ferdinand, prince of Portugal, and duke of Vi&s;eo, brother of Alphon&s;us V. and then (<HI>&s;ci.</HI> in 1460) pre&s;umptive heir to the crown, to which his &s;on Emanuel afterwards &s;ucceeded, po|&s;itively declares, that the history and acts of the &s;aid TIRANT were written in the Engli&s;h tongue, <HI>"EN LENGUA ANGLESA;"</HI> that he had TRANSLATED them out of THAT LANGUAGE into PORTUGUESE, at the direct in&s;tance of the above prince, who thought, that, as he (Martorell) had been &s;ometime in England, "<HI>EN LA ILLA DE ANGLETERRA</HI> <NOTE N="(53)" PLACE="foot">In the &s;uite, perhaps, of Peter duke of Coimbra, one of the &s;ons of John I. who was here in the third year of king Henry VI. (1425) at who&s;e court he was magnificently enter|tained, and made a knight of the Garter: An honour which Martorell has conferred upon the hero of his romance, whom he &s;uppo&s;es to be the fir&s;t that received it. As to prince Ferdi|nand, though he might never be in England, it is not improbable that he under&s;tood &s;ome|thing of the language; being grand&s;on of Philippa, &s;ister of our Henry IV. and wife of the above John. He dyed in 1471, aged thirty; &s;o that he could not well have been more than nineteen when he impo&s;ed the ta&s;k of this translation upon Martorell.</NOTE>, he would know the tongue better than others; that he had &s;ince translated the book out of Portugue&s;e into his native dialect the VALENCIAN <NOTE N="(54)" PLACE="foot">He onely lived, it appears, to fini&s;h the three fir&s;t books; the fourth and la&s;t part is &s;ayed to be translated <HI>"a pregaries de la noble &s;enyora dona y&s;abel de lori&ccedil;, per lo magnifich caualler mo&s;&s;en marti iohau de galba."</HI></NOTE>; and apologi&s;es for the defects of his ver&s;ion, as being in &s;ome mea&s;ure occa&s;ioned by the peculiar difficulties of the Engli&s;h language, which he had, in many places, found it impracticable to translate. But, as you appear to under&s;tand Valencian <NOTE N="(55)" PLACE="foot">See before, p. 30.</NOTE>, I &s;hall give you his own words: <HI>"Car &s;i d'faliments algu~s hi &s;on certament &s;enyor nes en part cau&s;a da dita LENGUA A~GLESA de la qual en algunes partides es inpo&s;&s;ible poder be girar los vocables."</HI> It is &s;trange enough, that an author, more e&s;pe|cially of Martorells con&s;equence, who is &s;tiled <HI>"lo magnifich e virtuos ca|valler,"</HI> &s;hould have the con&s;idence to impo&s;e upon his patron not onely a feigned original, but a feigned command to translate it, and an imaginary translation too. This is an enigma we cannot at pre&s;ent &s;olve. It is not impo&s;|&s;ible, however, that Martorell might actually pick up &s;ome part of his &s;ub|ject during his re&s;idence in England. What makes this conjecture the le&s;s
<PB N="46" REF="48">improbable is the u&s;e he has made of the &s;tory of <HI>"Comte gillem de uaroych",</HI> (Guy of Warwick) which we know to have been then extant in Engli&s;h. The origin of THE GARTER, the magnificent celebration of the nuptials of the king of England (alluding, mo&s;t likely, to tho&s;e of Richard II.) with the king of France's daughter, and &s;ome few other particulars, he may, undoubtedly, have got here: Though one might, perhaps, be led to think that he has derived his principal information on the&s;e heads from old Froi&s;&s;art, a favourite historian during the continuance of chivalry. But, independent of his own a&s;&s;ertions, the venial deceits of a romantic age, there is the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t conclu&s;ive evidence, as well intrin&s;ic as extrin&s;ic, that Martorell, whether he wrote fir&s;t in Portugue&s;e or Valencian, was the original author. As to the work it&s;elf, it is a mo&s;t ingenious and admirable performance, well de&s;erving the prai&s;es be&s;towed upon it by Cervantes <NOTE N="(56)" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Don Quixote,</HI> p. 1. l. 1. c: 6. The romance of Tirante was, early in the 16th century, translated into Castilian; from thence into Italian, and about 30 or 40 years ago into French. The two latter translators were entire &s;trangers to the original, of which there is not, perhaps, more than one &s;ingle copy known to be extant.</NOTE>, and much beyond any thing of the kind ever pro|duced in England, or even (if one dare venture to &s;ay it) capable of being &s;o.</P>
<P>You will not de&s;ire me to take further notice of your a&s;&s;ertion, that this romance was fir&s;t written in the language of Britany. I have, I think, &s;ayed enough to make you completely a&s;hamed of your&s;elf, if you have a particle of modesty in your compo&s;ition. But what credit, let me a&s;k, is a reader to place in the reveries and confident declarations of &s;o ignorant, &s;o fal&s;e, and &s;o conceited a writer?</P>
<P>Your HYPOTHESIS, as you call it, is &s;o fal&s;e, &s;o groundle&s;s, &s;o vi&s;ionary, and ab&s;urd, that I am equally willing to believe it your own, and to leave you in peacable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. Neither have I any thing, at pre&s;ent, to &s;ay to "the mo&s;t learned and ingenious M.

<P>That "our king Arthur" might be "&s;ometimes called Arthur of Little: Brittayne," as he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been king of both countries, is pro|bable enough, though I do not believe it. I am, however, ready to allow that "there is a romance with that title," which may, for any thing I know to the contrary, have been "reprinted in 1609." But they who told you that &s;hould, at the &s;ame time, have informed you that Arthur of Little Britain, the hero of that romance, is a very different per&s;on from king Arthur of Great Britain.

<P>I have at length, Mr. Warton, completed my de&s;ign of expo&s;ing to the public eye a tolerable &s;pecimen of the numerous errors, fal&s;ities, and plagia|ri&s;ms, of which you have been guilty in the cour&s;e of your celebrated History. And, though I am con&s;cious of having left con&s;iderable gleanings to any who may be inclined to follow me, I tru&s;t I have given you much rea&s;on to be &s;orry, and more to be a&s;hamed: But whether my arguments will produce any &s;uch effects, I, really, neither know, nor care.</P>
<P>Next to the civil history of a country, an account of its language, literature, and poetry is, both to natives and &s;trangers, the mo&s;t intere&s;ting and important &s;ubject that can be conceived. A &s;ubject which requires and de&s;erves the greate&s;t talents and mo&s;t unremiting industry. But this is a ta&s;k for which you, of all men who have ever pretended to write history, are the lea&s;t qua|lifyed. Your language, I confe&s;s, is ea&s;y and elegant; but your indolence in collecting and examining materials; and, beyond every thing, your igno|rance of the &s;ubject, &s;hould have prevented you from engaging in a work of &s;uch great and general con&s;equence; in which, whatever might be your progre&s;s, how uninformed &s;oever you might esteem the bulk of your readers, you were certain, at la&s;t, of encountering detection and disgrace. You have entitled your performance the HISTORY of Engli&s;h Poetry. It is the extreme of <HI>hyperbole,</HI> and a gro&s;s in&s;ult to common &s;en&s;e! Could you flatter your&s;elf
<PB N="48" REF="50">that your <HI>calling</HI> it a HISTORY would induce the public to accept it for one. Alas! what do they perceive, but an injudicious <HI>farrago,</HI> a <HI>gallimawfry</HI> of things which both do and do not belong to the &s;ubject, thrown and jumbled together, without &s;ystem, arrangement, or per&s;picuity:
<Q><L>&mdash;a dark</L>
<L>Illimitable ocean, without bound,</L>
<L>Without dimen&s;ion, where length, breadth, and highth,</L>
<L>And time and place are lo&s;t!</L></Q>
The reader is bewildered in mazes; he turns round and round; and wanders backward and foreward, and foreward and backward, and at la&s;t finds his|&s;elf ju&s;t where he &s;et out, heartyly tired, and without anything to con&s;ole him for the tediousne&s;s and labour of the journey;&mdash;unle&s;s he can pick a flower or two (for flowers there certainly are) from among&s;t the numerous weeds and briars which intercept his pa&s;&s;age, and entangle his foot&s;teps. Want of method, however, is the lea&s;t fault of which you can be accu&s;ed. If your collections had been authentic, though of their&s;elves no history, nor capable, in your hands, of becoming one, they might at lea&s;t have been u&s;eful to &s;ome &s;ub&s;equent writer better qualifyed for the purpo&s;e. But we &s;ee (as has been here &s;ufficiently proved) you are not to be relyed on in a &s;ingle in|&s;tance; the work being a continued ti&s;&s;ue of fal&s;ehood from beginning to end. Suffer me, as a friend,&mdash;to your &s;ubject, at lea&s;t,&mdash;to recommend it to you, to take all the advice and a&s;&s;istance you can get from the mo&s;t able literary characters who may be willing to render you either, and immediately &s;et abous a diligent revi&s;al and correction <NOTE N="(57)" PLACE="foot">I would likewi&s;e wi&s;h you to be convinced of another fault which ought to be carefully rooted out; I mean your ful&s;ome and disgu&s;ting <HI>Egoti&s;m.</HI> There is &s;ome difference between the <HI>History of Engli&s;h Portry,</HI> and the <HI>Life and Opinions of Thomas Warton.</HI></NOTE> of your three volumes already publi&s;hed, deferring the remainder of the work till it be worthy of the light; do justice to tho&s;e writers to whom you have been actually indebted; and omit that which is unnece&s;&s;ary, and which you have, from the vile&s;t motive, in&s;erted merely to extend and enlarge the work; even if, by &s;o doing, your three volumes &s;hould be reduced to two: That the work may not remain a monu|ment of disgrace to your&s;elf and your country. Of all men living, the learned and intelligent editor of The CANTERBURY TALES is the be&s;t able to afford you the requi&s;ite help; and, &s;urely, in a matter of &s;uch univer&s;al con|cern, if you apply to him with &s;incerity, he will not withhold it. His pub|lication of Chaucer is the mo&s;t erudite, curious and valuable performance that (excepting onely that mine of literary trea&s;ure Dr. Hickeses The&s;aurus, which never had, nor ever will have, its equal) has yet appeared in this country. I do not, however, mean to pronounce it entirely faultle&s;s: It undoubtedly contains &s;ome mistakes <NOTE N="(58)" PLACE="foot">Such as his &s;uppo&s;ing Chaucers lines to contain eleven &s;yllables; an idea as ju&s;t as that 3 and 3 make 7:&mdash;his adopting and mis&s;pelling certain words contrary to the evidence of all the MSS. he con&s;ulted:&mdash; a few erroneous notions with re&s;pect to Chaucers language, and the nature and history of the Engli&s;h tongue:&mdash;with &s;ome others, perhaps, of &s;till le&s;s con&s;equence: From all which, however, it is to be wi&s;hed &s;o excellent a work were totally free'd</NOTE>; but they are very few; and, being
<PB N="49" REF="51">chiefly confined to matter of opinion, will be thought rather trifleing than important, rather innocent than dangerous. Even the <HI>errors</HI> of SUCH MEN are intitled to re&s;pect. And, for the later periods of our literary history, who is there &s;o well informed, &s;o judicious, or &s;o liberal, as the worthy and amiable writer of the "E&s;&s;ay on the Learning of Shake&s;peare?" Thus a&s;&s;i&s;ted, Mr. War|ton, you might, probably, render your work, in reality, what you have had the modesty to entitle it. Not that I have, after all, the &s;lighte&s;t expectation of your taking any further trouble about the matter; unle&s;s, indeed, the &s;ale of the revi&s;ed work &s;hould appear likely to produce you &s;ome con&s;iderable advantage. However, you are equally obliged to me for my good advice, whether you embrace it or not. And as I am &s;atisfyed that you will continue to write upon the &s;ubject, &s;o long as you can find materials, however, flim&s;y, or purcha&s;ers, however &s;imple, I beg leave to recommend to a re&s;pectable department in your <HI>&s;eventh</HI> volume, or rather to a volume or two of its own, a Virgin Article for which I have highe&s;t regard:&mdash;The Poetical Annals of the Briti&s;h Nur&s;ery:&mdash;With two learned Differtations&mdash;I. On the origin and u&s;e of the ancient <HI>Lullabies;</HI> II. On the GESTA ROMANORUM of the Nur|&s;ery&mdash;Mother Goo&s;e's Tales. You could not rea&s;onably de&s;ire a more ample field for the display of your amazing erudition in all its branches. Your "epi&s;ode" (and the more "disproportionate" it is, the better) on a thea|tre, which, as you very ju&s;tly ob&s;erve, is "of the lowe&s;t &s;pecies, and the highe&s;t antiquity," will be allowed to comprehend the whole history of the genuine mode of &s;cenic repre&s;entiation, from Thespis to Flockton; inter&s;per&s;ed with a variety of &s;urpri&s;ing ob&s;ervations, and unheared of facts. The&s;e will eke out many a loo&s;e and ea&s;y page; while your disqui&s;itions upon Puerile Architecture, or the art of con&s;tructing Castles of Cards, will not onely involve the ri&s;e, progre&s;s, and grand arcana of Free-ma&s;onry, which are all compri&s;ed in this curious and antique proce&s;s, but give you, at the &s;ame time, a fine op|portunity of exhibiting your whole fund of knowlege in the &s;cience, of which you have induced us to believe that you are perfect master; and by not writing, at lea&s;t not publi&s;hing, your promi&s;ed work, have been wi&s;e enough not to undeceive us. One cannot ea&s;yly imagine a more plea&s;ing or fruitful &s;ubject, nor a historian better qualifyed to do it justice; unle&s;s, in|deed, your want of fidelity and care may be thought an in&s;uperable objection: But I am not without hope that even the pre&s;ent addre&s;s will have the good fortune to make you a little more cautious on tho&s;e heads in your future lu|cubrations.</P>
