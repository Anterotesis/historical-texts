<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE author of the following poem is apprehen&s;ive, that neither he nor the objects of his &s;atire, are of con&s;equence enough to engage attention to &s;o long a piece as he has been drawn into by the nature of his &s;ubject; but as he has been pe&s;tered with defamatory pieces for &s;everal months pa&s;t, with ROSCIADS, APOLOGIES, MURPHYADS, MERETRICIADS, &amp;c &amp;c. &amp;c. and as it mu&s;t be imagined that the men, who have mi&s;carried of all the&s;e libels have found encouragement from &s;ome &s;orts of readers, it is now hoped that they who have afforded lei&s;ure for a peru&s;al of the pieces again&s;t the pre&s;ent writer, will do him the ju&s;tice to hear him &s;peak for him&s;elf. He is &s;orry that he has been obliged to employ his time in this &s;ort of controver&s;y, which he de&s;pi&s;es as a thing illiberal in it&s;elf, di&s;honourable to letters, and generally the mean &s;ubterfuge of tho&s;e who want to make a livelihood of an author's name; but he thought the rancour di&s;charged again&s;t him merited a retort, not for the mi&s;chief it had done, but on account of the malignity of the de&s;ign. Excited by this motive, he took up the pen, and as Mr. POPE &s;ays of his imitations of Horace, he thought an an&s;wer upon BOILEAU'S model would be more full, and of more dignity than any he could have made in his own per&s;on. He has only to add, that he does not intend to maintain the&s;e peo|ple by carrying on a paper-war; for unle&s;s he has &s;ome extreme
<PB REF="3">provocation, and that too with more wit than they have hitherto ex|erted, he is determined to look down upon them with a contemp|tuous &s;ilence for the future; his writings, &s;hould they attack them, will &s;peak, though feebly, for them&s;elves; and his morals, if tra|duced, will fal&s;ify their &s;lander, and tell each of them aloud (to u&s;e the words adopted by a noble prelate on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion) <HI>Mentiris Impudenti&s;&s;ime!</HI></P>

<P><HI>N. B.</HI> The Reader will ob&s;erve that <HI>EXPOSTULATION</HI> &s;tands at the Head of the Poem, though changed for another Word in the Title-Page; and this mu&s;t be accounted for.&mdash;The very Men who provoked the Author to this Piece began to crouch from the La&s;h as &s;oon as they heard it was hanging over them; and to weaken its Effect, they immediately adverti&s;ed a Poem, called <HI>The EX|POSTULATION.</HI> It was therefore thought proper not to cancel what was then printed off, but (to prevent the Confu&s;ion of two Pieces with the &s;ame Name) to give the &s;ub&s;equent Poem a new Title-Page; and now the Sons of Darkne&s;s are welcome to avail them&s;elves of their De&s;ign, truly worthy of &s;uch liberal Men!</P>
