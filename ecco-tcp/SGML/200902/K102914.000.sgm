<HEAD><HI>To Mr.</HI> GARRICK.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE UPHOLSTERER would be a <HI>Bankrupt</HI> even in thanks, could he think of going abroad into the World, without making his Com|pliments to Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> for the Civilities he has &s;hewn him. Whatever Figure the poor broken Politician might make before the Commi&s;&s;ioners of Bankruptcy at <HI>Guild-hall,</HI> you have taken care of his Appearance before the &s;elf-cho&s;en Commi&s;&s;ion|ers of Critici&s;m, at the Theatre Royal, in <HI>Drury-Lane.</HI></P>
<P>I am not willing to flatter my&s;elf that you were drawn forth, on this occa&s;ion, by any extra|ordinary Touches in the capital Figure, or in the <HI>Accompagnements du Tableau.</HI> I rather &s;uppo&s;e that you approved the Ju&s;tne&s;s of the De&s;ign, than that you were an Admirer of the Colouring.</P>
<P>The De&s;ign, Sir, was conceived and executed long &s;ince, becau&s;e the Author judged that &s;ome|thing in this way might have a &s;ea&s;onable tendency to allay the Intemperance of too violent a Political Spirit, or at lea&s;t to laugh it into good Humour: With the &s;ame view it was lately retouched, and given to Mr. <HI>Mo&s;&s;op,</HI> to be pre&s;ented to the Pub|lic at his Benefit. And however Men of a &s;erious Ca&s;t may depreciate Amu&s;ements of this nature, I &s;hall never blu&s;h for having dedicated a few Hours to them, as I am of opinion that &s;uch-like Avocations will more profitably unbend the Mind from graver Studies, than the &s;olitary Plea&s;ures of the Reclu&s;e, or any of the more open Di&s;&s;ipations of Life.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="3">
I am aware that you, will, very probably, recol|lect a Pa&s;&s;age in a celebrated Writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Monte&s;quicu.</HI></NOTE>, which may &s;eem to render the &s;cope of this little Piece &s;omewhat que&s;tionable. <Q><HI>Dans une Nation Libre</HI></Q> &s;aith he, <Q><HI>Il e&s;t tres Souvent indiferent que les Par|ticuliers Rai&s;onnets bien ou mal il &s;ufit qu'ils Rai&s;on|nent: de la &s;ort la Liberte qui Garantit des Ef|fets de ces memes Rai&s;onnements.</HI></Q> But you know that the Que&s;tion here, is not concerning the in|di&s;putable Right of the People to canva&s;s their national Concerns; but the vicious Exce&s;s of a propen&s;ity to Politics, when it gives a wrong Bias to the Mind, and is attended with Circum|&s;tances, which create the ridiculous Ab&s;urd. In this light it was con&s;idered by Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> who tells us in the <HI>Tatler,</HI> <NOTE N="&verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide Number</HI> 155. <HI>and</HI> 160.</NOTE> that he de&s;igned his Paper <Q>for the Benefit of tho&s;e Citizens, who live more in a Coffee-hou&s;e, than in their Shops, and who&s;e Thoughts are &s;o taken up with the Af|fairs of the Allies, that they forget their Cu&s;|tomers.</Q> For the very &s;ame Species of People, the <HI>Uphol&s;terer</HI> was brought on the Stage, being perhaps as proper an Object of Ridicule, as mo|dern I de as and Manners will afford.</P>
<P>With regard to the Execution, I &s;hall not detain you any longer on that head, than to remark that to pre&s;erve the Gravity, which is a &s;pecific Quality in Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI>'s fine vein of Humour, has been my Endeavour throughout the Whole; though I am not in&s;en&s;ible that grave Humour is &s;ometimes dangerous on the Stage. In the principal Charac|ter I con&s;idered my&s;elf rather de&s;cribing a <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> than a <HI>Man;</HI> and this you remember is mentioned by an excellent Critic, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Hurd.</HI></NOTE> to belong to the Province of Farce. For this Rea&s;on the UPHOLSTERER'S
<PB N="iii" REF="4">
Scenes are &s;trongly tinctured with his predominant Foible; and as this Foible is generally fed and inflamed by a &s;warm of political Writers, I judged it coincident with my Plan, to expo&s;e the Duplicity of their Conduct, by introducing the Character of PAMPHLET.</P>
<P>This Character I have had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing &s;et off with all the exqui&s;ite Strokes of &s;o fine a Comic Genius as Mr. GARRICK'S, without being indebted for Succe&s;s to the Aid of per&s;onal Satire, having entirely levelled it again&s;t tho&s;e, who are the ready Mercenaries of all Parties; and with all &s;uch I have the Happine&s;s not to be acquainted.</P>
<P>I could here enlarge in the ju&s;t Prai&s;e of Mr. <HI>Woodward,</HI> Mr. <HI>Yates,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Clive, &amp;c.</HI> but I have already deviated too far from the Purpo&s;e, I &s;et out with; which was not to in&s;cribe a Farce to you, for neither of us thinks &s;o highly of the&s;e Mat|ters; nor to become your Panegyri&s;t, for your ex|tended Reputation does not &s;tand in need of it. My Intention was to embrace a public Opportu|nity of &s;ub&s;cribing my&s;elf.</P>
