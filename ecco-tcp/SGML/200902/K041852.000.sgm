<BYLINE>Spoken by Mr. SMITH.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<L>BOLD was the man, and &s;enc'd in ev'ry part</L>
<L>With oak, and ten-fold bra&s;s about the heart,</L>
<L>To build a play who tortur'd fir&s;t his brain,</L>
<L>And then dar'd launch it on this &s;tormy main.</L>
<L>What tho', at fir&s;t, he &s;preads his little &s;ails</L>
<L>To Heav'n's indulgent and propitious gales,</L>
<L>As the land gradual le&s;&s;ens to his eye</L>
<L>He finds a troubled &s;ea, and low'ring &s;ky:</L>
<L>Envy, detraction, calumny, and &s;pite,</L>
<L>Ra6i&s;e a wor&s;e &s;torm than when the winds unite.</L>
<L>Around his bark, in many a dang'rous &s;hoal,</L>
<L>Tho&s;e mon&s;ters of the deep, the critics, prowl.</L>
<L>"She's a weak ve&s;&s;el, for the&s;e &s;eas unfit,</L>
<L>"And has on board her not a &s;pice of wit:</L>
<L>"She's French-built too; of foreign make," they cry;</L>
<L>Like gee&s;e &s;till cackling that the Gauls are nigh.</L>
<L>If thrown on rocks by the hoar&s;e da&s;hing wave,</L>
<L>Th' unhappy crew no hand is &s;tretch'd to &s;ave;</L>
<L>But round the wreck, like Moors, with furious joy,</L>
<L>The witlings crowd&mdash;to murder and de&s;troy,</L>
<L>The&s;e are known dangers; and, &s;till full as certain,</L>
<L>The bard meets other ills behind the curtain.</L>
<L>Little you think, ere yet you fix his fate,</L>
<L>What previous mi&s;chiefs there in ambu&s;h wait;</L>
<L>What plagues ari&s;e from all the mimic throng:</L>
<L>"My part's too &s;hort;&mdash;and, Sir, my part's too long."</L>
<L><PB REF="4">This calls for incident; that repartee.</L>
<L>"Down the back-&s;tairs pen an e&s;cape for me.</L>
<L>"Give me a ladder, Mr. Bayes, of rope;</L>
<L>"I love to wear the breeches, and elope.</L>
<L>"Something for me the groundlings ears to &s;plit.</L>
<L>"Write a dark clo&s;et, or a fainting-fit.</L>
<L>"Fix Woodward in &s;ome whim&s;ical di&s;grace:</L>
<L>"Or be facetious with Ned Shuter's face."</L>
<L>This is our way; and yet our bard to night</L>
<L>Removes each ob&s;tacle, and &s;prings to light.</L>
<L>Some &s;cenes, we hope, he brings to nature true;</L>
<L>Some gleams of humour, and a moral too;</L>
<L>But no &s;trange mon&s;ters offers to your view:</L>
<L>No forms, grote&s;que and wild, are here at &s;trife:</L>
<L>He boa&s;ts an etching from the real life;</L>
<L>Exerts his efforts, in a poli&s;h'd age,</L>
<L>To drive the Smithfield mu&s;es from the &s;tage;</L>
<L>By ea&s;y dialogue would win your prai&s;e,</L>
<L>And on fair decency graft all his bayes.</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I require true devotion in your prayers. Would it not provoke the patience of a &s;aint to have a well-powder'd fop kneel at his &s;hrine, with a "There's a hand&s;ome fellow for you; mind my cloaths, Bru&s;&s;els lace, diamond-ring, &s;aucy &s;nuff-box, and impudent face?" And this too under the notion of a&s;king a ble&s;&s;ing.</P>

<SPEAKER>BELLFIELD.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Lucinda, I never knew you &s;o much out. Would not you have a man go to his prayers with a good con&s;cience? And what are the plea&s;ures of a good con&s;cience? The ap|plau&s;es of one's own heart.&mdash;Now, my dear ma'am, if, when I approach you, I have &s;ome &s;elf-approving airs, am not I therefore the better intitled to you?</P>
