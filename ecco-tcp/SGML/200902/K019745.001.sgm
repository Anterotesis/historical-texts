<HEAD>THE LADY's MUSEUM.</HEAD>
<P>_AS I do not &s;et out with great promi&s;es to the public of the wit, humour, and morality, which this pamphlet is to contain, &s;o I expect no reproaches to fall on me, if I &s;hould happen to fail in any, or all of the&s;e articles.</P>
<P>My readers may depend upon it, I will always be as witty as I can, as humorous as I can, as moral as I can, and upon the whole as entertaining as I can. However, as I have but too much rea&s;on to di&s;tru&s;t my own powers of plea&s;ing, I &s;hall u&s;her in my pamphlet with the performance of a lady, who po&s;&s;ibly would never have &s;uffered it to ap|pear in print, if this opportunity had not offered.</P>
<P>If her &s;prightly paper meets with encourage|ment enough to di&s;pel the diffidence natural to a young writer, &s;he will be prevailed upon, I hope, to continue it in this Mu&s;eum; I &s;hall therefore, with|out any farther preface, pre&s;ent it to my readers.</P>

<HEAD>The TRIFLER. [NUMBER I.]</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAST your eyes upon paper, madam; there you may lock innocently,</HI> &s;aid a polite old gentle|man of my acquaintance to me, one day, in the words of a wit to a fine lady. A compliment is no unplea&s;ing way of conveying advice to a young wo|man, and when that advice may be &s;o con&s;trued, as to become perfectly agreeable to her own inclina|tions, it is certain to be well received, and quickly complied with. It is indeed very clear to me, that my friend in this borrowed admonition recommend|ed reading to eyes which he probably thought were too intent upon plea&s;ing; but I, with a &s;mall deviation from the &s;en&s;e, applied it, to what is I freely own my predominant pa&s;&s;ion; and therefore re&s;olved to write, &s;till pur&s;uing the &s;ame darling end, though by different means.</P>
<P>So frankly to acknowledge the de&s;ire of plea&s;|ing to be my predominant pa&s;&s;ion, is in other words, to confe&s;s my&s;elf, one of that ridiculous &s;pecies of beings, called a coquet.&mdash;This will be &s;aid by &s;ome, and thought by others, for all do not &s;ay what they think on &s;uch occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Yet to that laudable principle, in women mi&s;tak|en for coquetry, we owe the thunder of eloquence in the &s;enate, as well as the glitter of dre&s;s in the
<PB N="3" REF="5">
drawing-room. An animated &s;peech, and a well-cho&s;en &s;ilk, are equally the effects of a de&s;ire to plea&s;e, both in the patriot and the beauty: and if the one is ever ob&s;erved to be &s;ilent, and the other without ornaments, it is becau&s;e he is per&s;uaded, that &s;ilence is mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive; and &s;he, that ne|gligence is mo&s;t becoming.</P>
<P>But for this active principle, the &s;tate&s;man would be no politician, and the general no warrior. The de&s;ire of fame, or the de&s;ire of plea&s;ing, which, in my opinion, are &s;ynonimous terms, pro|duces application in one and courage in the other. It is the poet's in&s;piration, the patriot's zeal, the courtier's loyalty, and the orator's eloquence. All are coquets, if that be coquetry, and tho&s;e grave per&s;onages and the fine lady are alike liable to be charged with it.</P>
<P>But it will be objected, that the di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic of a coquet is to u&s;e her powers of plea&s;ing to the ungenerous purpo&s;e of giving pain; the &s;ame may be &s;aid of each of the others. All human excellence, as well as human happine&s;s, is comparative. We are admired but in proportion as we excel others, and whoever excels is &s;ure to give pain, to his inferiors in merit, either from envy or emulation; pa&s;&s;ions which produce &s;en|&s;ations nearly alike, although their con&s;equences are very different.</P>
<P>I hope I have now fully proved, that I, tho' a woman, young, &s;ingle, gay, and ambitious of plea&s;ing, de&s;erve not the odious appellation of coquet; I &s;ay, I hope, I have proved it, for I am
<PB N="4" REF="6">
but eighteen, and not u&s;ed to be contradicted in an argument.
<Q><L>"If &s;eldom your opinions err;</L>
<L>"Your eyes are always in the right,"</L></Q>
&s;ays the gallant Prior. Hence it follows that we al|ways triumph in a di&s;pute, though I cannot help allowing, that we often triumph without victory.</P>
<P>Univer&s;ally as I could wi&s;h to plea&s;e in this paper, yet I &s;hall be contented, if it finds only a favourable acceptance with my own &s;ex, to who&s;e amu&s;ement it is chiefly de&s;igned to contribute.</P>
<P>To introduce it to them under the denomination of a trifle may be thought an affront to their un|der&s;tandings. But in the choice of my title, I re|membered the fable of the mountain that brought forth a mou&s;e. That I have promi&s;ed little is my &s;ecurity from cen&s;ure; if I give more it will be my be&s;t claim to prai&s;e. I &s;hould indeed have thought &s;ome apology nece&s;&s;ary for an undertaking of this kind, had I not been per&s;uaded, it was a mighty ea&s;y one, from its being &s;o frequently at|tempted, and by per&s;ons too of my own &s;ex.</P>
<P>The &s;ubjects I propo&s;e to treat of will be &s;uch as reading and ob&s;ervation &s;hall furni&s;h me with; for, with a &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion for intellectual plea&s;ures, I have likewi&s;e a ta&s;te for many of the fa&s;hionable amu&s;ements, and in the di&s;po&s;ition of my time, I have contrived to gratify both the&s;e inclinations; one I thought too laudable to be re&s;trained, the other I found too plea&s;ing to be wholly &s;ubdued.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7">I am already aware that I have talked too much of my&s;elf: it is indeed a &s;ubject one cannot ea&s;ily quit, and perhaps I am not &s;orry, that in introduc|tory papers of this &s;ort, the writers have generally given &s;ome account of them&s;elves. Every one knows that long cu&s;tom has the force of a law; and, in obedience to this, I &s;hall fill up my fir&s;t paper with a &s;hort hi&s;tory of my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I am the daughter of a gentleman remarkable only in this, that during the cour&s;e of a pretty long life, he never lo&s;t a friend, or made an ene|my. From which &s;ingular circum&s;tance I leave the reader to collect his character. My mother was generally allowed to be a well bred-woman, and an excellent economi&s;t. In her youth &s;he was extremely indulged by her parents, who, on ac|count of a &s;light di&s;order in her eyes, would not &s;uffer her to u&s;e her needle, or look into a book, except on Sundays or holidays, when &s;he was per|mitted to read two or three ver&s;es of a chapter in the Bible.</P>
<P>My mother therefore grew up, not only without any ta&s;te, but with a high contempt for reading; and tho&s;e of her female acquaintance who had made any proficiency that way were &s;ure to be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by her, with the opprobrious term of be|ing <HI>book-learned,</HI> which my mother always pro|nounced with a look and accent of ineffable &s;corn.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter, who is a year younger than my&s;elf, &s;o entirely engro&s;&s;ed her affection, that I was wholly neglected by her. My fondne&s;s for reading, which I di&s;covered very early, encrea&s;ed her di&s;like of me. As &s;he &s;eldom cho&s;e to have me in her &s;ight,
<PB N="6" REF="8">
I had opportunities &s;ufficient to indulge my&s;elf in this favourite amu&s;ement, for I had taken po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of all the books my brother left behind him, when he went to the univer&s;ity; but having great &s;en&s;ibility of &s;oul, I was &s;o affected with my mo|ther's partial fondne&s;s for my &s;i&s;ter, and neglect of me, that young as I then was, I often pa&s;t whole nights in tears, lamenting my misfortune.</P>
<P>But this &s;en&s;ibility entirely ruined me with my mother; for, being one day exce&s;&s;ively &s;hocked at &s;ome new in&s;tance of her partiality, I went up &s;obbing to the nur&s;ery, and had recour&s;e to a book for my relief. It happened to be Ae&s;op's Fables: I opened it at the following one, which &s;triking my imagination, then full of the preference given by my mother to my &s;i&s;ter, I followed a &s;udden im|pul&s;e, and &s;ent it to my mother, de&s;iring &s;he would be plea&s;ed to read it; for I did not doubt but &s;he would make a proper application of it.</P>
<Q>An ape had twins: &s;he doated upon one of them, and did not much care for the other. She took a &s;udden fright one day, and in a hurry whips up her darling under her arm, and took no heed of the other, which therefore leaped a&s;tride upon her &s;houlders. In this ha&s;te down &s;he comes, and beats out her favourite's brains upon a &s;tone, while that which &s;he had on her back came off &s;afe and &s;ound.</Q>
<P>My mother, &s;urpri&s;ed at the novelty of the re|que&s;t, read the fable, and immediately afterwards came up to the nur&s;ery in great wrath, and cor|rected me &s;everely, for calling her an <HI>ape,</HI> prophe|tically declaring that a girl who at nine years old
<PB N="7" REF="9">
could be &s;o wicked, as to compare her mother to an <HI>ape,</HI> would never come to good.</P>
<P>Every one who came to the hou&s;e was told the horrid crime I had been guilty of, the &s;ervants held me in the utmo&s;t dete&s;tation for comparing my mother to an <HI>ape,</HI> never mentioning it, with|out lifted up hands and eyes, in abhorrence of &s;uch early undutifulne&s;s.</P>
<P>My father, who had loved me with great ten|derne&s;s, was dead when this incident happened; and the mo&s;t effectual way of paying court to my mamma being to care&s;s my &s;i&s;ter, and take no no|tice of me, I met with very few friends, either at home or abroad.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of humiliation and di&s;grace my bro|ther found me, at his return from the univer&s;ity. When my &s;i&s;ter and I were pre&s;ented to him, my mother did not fail to relate the crime for which I had &s;uffered &s;o much, &s;hewing him the book, which &s;he had kept carefully ever after, with the leaf doubled down, at the fatal fable, declaring &s;he thought her&s;elf very unhappy in having given birth to a child who was likely to prove &s;o great an af|fliction to her; <Q>for may not every thing that is bad, &s;aid &s;he, be expected from a girl who at her years could compare her mother to an <HI>ape?</HI></Q></P>
<P>My brother read the fable, and my mother leav|ing the room to give &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary orders, he ran eagerly to me, &s;natched me up in his arms, and gave me a hundred ki&s;&s;es. My little heart was &s;o &s;en&s;ibly affected with a tenderne&s;s to which I had not been accu&s;tomed, that I bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10">My mother at her return found me &s;obbing, with the violence of my emotions, and did not doubt but my brother had been chiding me. He told her gravely, that &s;ince I was &s;o fond of read|ing, he would regulate my &s;tudies him&s;elf, and take care I &s;hould read no books which might teach me to be undutiful.</P>
<P>To this dear brother I owe the advantage of a right education, which I had like to have mi&s;&s;ed. After my mother's death he took me entirely under his own care. My &s;i&s;ter cho&s;e to re&s;ide with an aunt, who&s;e heir &s;he expects to be; and while &s;he is a &s;lave to the caprices of an old woman, I have the plea&s;ure of being the mi&s;tre&s;s of a well-ordered family, for I keep my brother's hou&s;e; and by en|deavouring to make him an u&s;eful as well as agree|able companion, enjoy the &s;weet &s;atisfaction of &s;hewing every day my gratitude for obligations it can never be in my power to return.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE STUDIES proper for WOMEN.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Tran&s;lated from the French.</HEAD>
<P>TO prohibit women entirely from learning is treating them with the &s;ame indignity that Mahomet did, who, to render them voluptuous, denied them &s;ouls; and indeed the greate&s;t part of women act as if they had really adopted a tenet &s;o injurious to the &s;ex, and appear to &s;et no value upon that lively imagination, that &s;prightly wit which makes them more admired than beauty it&s;elf.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider the happy talents which wo|men in general po&s;&s;e&s;s, and how &s;ucce&s;sfully &s;ome have cultivated them, we cannot without indigna|tion ob&s;erve the little e&s;teem they have for the endowments of their minds which it is &s;o ea&s;y for them to improve. They are, as Montaigne &s;ays, flowers of quick growth, and by the delicacy of their conception, catch readily and without trouble the relation of things to each other. It is a melan|choly con&s;ideration that the mo&s;t precious gifts of nature &s;hould be &s;tifled, or ob&s;cured by a &s;hame|ful neglect.</P>
<P>The charms of their per&s;ons, how powerful &s;o|ever, may attract, but cannot fix us; &s;omething
<PB N="10" REF="12">
more than beauty is nece&s;&s;ary to rivet the lover's chain. By often beholding a beautiful face, the impre&s;&s;ion it fir&s;t made on us &s;oon wears away. When the woman who&s;e per&s;on we admire is inca|pable of plea&s;ing us by her conver&s;ation, languor and &s;atiety, &s;oon triumph over the ta&s;te we had for her charms: hence ari&s;es the incon&s;tancy with which we are &s;o often reproached; it is that barren|ne&s;s of ideas which we find in women that ren|ders men unfaithful.</P>
<P>The ladies may judge of the difference there is among them, by that which they them&s;elves make between a fool who tea&s;es them with his imper|tinence, and a man of letters who entertains them agreeably; a very little labour would equal them to the la&s;t, and perhaps give them the advantage. This is a kind of victory which we wi&s;h to yield them. We would, without envy, &s;ee them di|viding with us a good, who&s;e value is always greater than the labour by which it is acquired.</P>
<P>The more they &s;hall enlarge their notions, the more &s;ubjects of conver&s;ation will be found be|tween them and us, and the more &s;prightly and affecting will that conver&s;ation be. How many delicate &s;entiments, how many nice &s;en&s;ibilities are lo&s;t by not being communicable, and in which we &s;hould feel an increa&s;e of &s;atisfaction could we meet with women di&s;po&s;ed to ta&s;te them!</P>
<P>But what are the &s;tudies to which women may with propriety apply them&s;elves? This que&s;tion I take upon my&s;elf to an&s;wer; and I intreat the la|dies to pardon me, if among all the &s;ciences which exerci&s;e the wonderful activity of the human mind,
<PB N="11" REF="13">
I pronounce that only &s;ome are fit to be cultivated by them. I would particularly recommend to them to avoid all ab&s;tract learning, all thorny re|&s;earches, which may blunt the finer edge of their wit, and change the delicacy in which they excel into pedantic coar&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>If their &s;ex has produced Daciers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Anne le Fevre, wife of mon&s;ieur Dacier. She tran&s;lated Florus, Terence, and Homer, and added very learned notes of her own.</NOTE> and Chatelets <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gabriella Emilia de Br&eacute;teuil, marchione&s;s du Ch&acirc;telet.

The learning proper for women is &s;uch as be&s;t &s;uits the &s;oft elegance of their form, &s;uch as may add to their natural beauties, and qualify them for the &s;everal duties of life. There is nothing more di&s;gu&s;tful than tho&s;e female theologians, who, adopting all the animo&s;ity of the party they have thought fit to join, a&s;&s;emble ridiculous &s;ynods in their hou&s;es, and form extravagant &s;ects.

<P>It is in &s;uch parts of learning only as afford the highe&s;t improvement that we invite women to &s;hare with us. All that may awaken curio&s;ity, and lend graces to the imagination, &s;uits them &s;till bet|ter than us. This is a va&s;t field where we may together exerci&s;e the mind; and here they may even excel us without mortifying our pride.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory and natural philo&s;ophy are alone &s;uffi|cient to furni&s;h women with an agreeable kind of &s;tudy. The latter, in a &s;eries of u&s;eful ob&s;erva|tions and intere&s;ting experiments, offers a &s;pectacle well worthy the con&s;ideration of a rea&s;onable being. But in vain does nature pre&s;ent her miracles to the generality of women, who have no attention but to trifles: &s;he is dumb to tho&s;e who know not how to interrogate her.</P>
<P>Yet &s;urely it requires but a &s;mall degree of at|tention to be &s;truck with that wonderful harmony which reigns throughout the univer&s;e, and to be ambitious of inve&s;tigating its &s;ecret &s;prings. This is a large volume which is open to all; here a pair of beautiful eyes may employ them&s;elves without being fatigued. This amiable &s;tudy will bani&s;h languor from the &s;ober amu&s;ements of the country, and repair that wa&s;te of intellect which is cau&s;ed by the di&s;&s;ipations of the town. Women cannot
<PB N="13" REF="15">
be too much excited to rai&s;e their eyes to objects like the&s;e, which they but too often deba&s;e to &s;uch as are unworthy of them.</P>
<P>The &s;ex is more capable of attention than we imagine: what they chiefly want is a well directed application. There is &s;carcely a young girl who has not read with eagerne&s;s a great number of idle romances, and puerile tales, &s;ufficient to corrupt her imagination and cloud her under&s;tanding. If &s;he had devoted the &s;ame time to the &s;tudy of hi|&s;tory, &s;he would in tho&s;e varied &s;cenes which the world offers to view, have found facts more inte|re&s;ting, and in&s;truction which only truth can give.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e &s;triking pictures, that are di&s;played in the annals of the human race, are highly proper to direct the judgment, and form the heart. Women have at all times had &s;o great a &s;hare in events, and have acted &s;o many different parts, that they may with rea&s;on con&s;ider our archives as their own: nay, there are many of them who have written me|moirs of the &s;everal events of which they had been eye-witne&s;&s;es. Mademoi&s;elle de Montpen&s;ier, Ma|dame de N&eacute;mours, Madame de Motteville, are of this number. Chri&s;tina of Pi&s;an, daughter to the a&s;tronomer, patroni&s;ed by the Emperor Charles the fifth, has given us the life of that prince; and long before her, the prince&s;s Anna Comnenus wrote the hi&s;tory of her own times. We call upon the ladies to a&s;&s;ert their rights, and from the &s;tudy of hi&s;tory to extract u&s;eful le&s;&s;ons for the conduct of life.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="16">This &s;tudy, alike plea&s;ing and in&s;tructive, will naturally lead to that of the fine arts, which it is fit the ladies &s;hould have a le&s;s &s;uperficial know|ledge of. The arts are in them&s;elves too amiable to need any recommendation to the &s;ex: all the objects they offer to their view have &s;ome analogy with women, and are like them adorned with the brighte&s;t colours. The mind is agree|ably &s;oothed by tho&s;e images which poetry, paint|ing, and mu&s;ick trace out to it, e&s;pecially if they are found to agree with purity of manners. It was the&s;e three charming arts, which, in the la&s;t reign, render|ed Mademoi&s;elle Ch&eacute;ron &s;o celebrated; a lady in whom the talents of Sappho, of M&mdash;, and of Ro|&s;alba were united.</P>
<P>To familiarize our&s;elves with the arts is in &s;ome degree to create a new &s;en&s;e. So agreeably have they imitated nature, nay, &s;o often have they em|belli&s;hed it, that whoever cultivates them, will in them always find a fruitful &s;ource of new plea&s;ures. We ought to provide again&s;t the encroachments of languor and wearine&s;s by this addition to our na|tural riches; and &s;urely when we may &s;o ea&s;ily transfer to our&s;elves the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that multitude of plea&s;ing ideas which they have created, it would be the highe&s;t &s;tupidity to neglect &s;uch an advan|tage.</P>
<P>There is no rea&s;on to fear that the ladies, by ap|plying them&s;elves to the&s;e &s;tudies, will throw a &s;hade over the natural graces of their wit. No; on the con|trary, tho&s;e graces will be placed in a more con&s;picuous point of view: what can equal the plea&s;ure we re|ceive from the conver&s;ation of a woman who is
<PB N="15" REF="17">
more &s;olicitous to adorn her mind than her per&s;on? In the company of &s;uch women there can be no &s;atiety; every thing becomes intere&s;ting, and has a &s;ecret charm which only they can give. The de|lightful art of &s;aying the mo&s;t ingenious things with a graceful &s;implicity is peculiar to them: it is they who call forth the powers of wit in men, and communicate to them that ea&s;y elegance which is never to be acquired in the clo&s;et.</P>
<P>But what pre&s;ervative is there again&s;t wearine&s;s and di&s;gu&s;t in the &s;ociety of women of weak and unimproved under&s;tanding? In vain do they en|deavour to fill the void of their conver&s;ation with in&s;ipid gaiety: they &s;oon exhau&s;t the barren funds of fa&s;hionable trifles, the news of the day, and hackneyed compliments; they are at length obliged to have recour&s;e to &s;candal, and it is well if they &s;top there: a commerce in which there is nothing &s;olid mu&s;t be either mean or criminal.</P>
<P>There is but one way to make it more varied and more intere&s;ting. If ladies of the fir&s;t rank would conde&s;cend to form their ta&s;te upon our be&s;t authors, and collect ideas from their u&s;e|ful writings, conver&s;ation would take another ca&s;t: their acknowledged merit would bani&s;h that &s;warm of noi&s;y impertinents who flutter about them, and who endeavour to render them as contemptible as them&s;elves: men of &s;en&s;e and learning would then frequent their a&s;&s;emblies, and form a circle more worthy of the name of <HI>good company</HI></P>
<P>In this new circle gaiety would not be bani&s;hed, but refined by delicacy and wit. Merit is not au|&s;tere in its nature; there is a calm and uniform
<PB N="16" REF="18">
chearfulne&s;s that runs through the conver&s;ation of per&s;ons of real under&s;tanding, which is far pre|ferable to the noi&s;y mirth of ignorance and folly. Tho&s;e &s;ocieties formed by the Sevignes, the Fayetts, the Sabli&eacute;res, with the Vivonnes, the La Fares, and Rochefoucaults, were &s;urely more plea&s;ing than the a&s;&s;emblies of our days. Among them learn|ing was not pedantic, nor wi&s;dom &s;evere; and &s;ub|jects of the highe&s;t importance were treated with all the &s;prightline&s;s of wit.</P>
<P>The ladies mu&s;t allow me once more to repeat to them that the only means of charming, and of charming long, is to improve their minds; good &s;en&s;e gives beauties which are not &s;ubject to fade like the lillies and ro&s;es of their cheeks, but will prolong the power of an agreeable woman to the autumn of her life <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was by her wit that the Dutche&s;s of Valentinois charm|ed three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive monarchs, and pre&s;erved her influence to an extreme old age. It was to their wit that Madame de V&eacute;rac, Madam Tencin, and &s;everal other ladies owed their power of charming when their youth was fled. The graces of a fine under&s;tanding, improved by &s;tudy, never grow old.</NOTE>. If the &s;ex would not have their influence confined to the &s;hort triumph of a day, they mu&s;t endeavour to improve their natural talents by &s;tudy, and the conver&s;ation of men of letters. Neglect will not then &s;teal upon them in proportion as their bloom decays; but they will unite in them&s;elves all the advantages of both &s;exes.</P>
<P>We live no longer in an age when prejudice condemned women as well as the nobility, to a &s;hameful ignorance. The ridicule with which pe|dantry
<PB N="17" REF="19">
was treated had &s;o much di&s;credited every kind of knowledge, that there were many ladies who thought it graceful to murder the words of their native language; but &s;ome were &s;till found, who, &s;haking off the yoke of fa&s;hion, ventured to think ju&s;tly, and &s;peak with propriety; and even at this time there are a &s;mall number who are not a&s;hamed of being more learned than the idle man of fa&s;hion, and the fluttering courtier.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF HARRIOT AND SOPHIA.</HEAD>
<P>HARRIOT and Sophia were the daughters of a gentleman, who, having &s;pent a good paternal inheritance before he was five and thirty, was reduced to live upon the moderate &s;alary of a place at court, which his friends procured him to get rid of his importunities. The &s;ame impru|dence by which he had been governed in affairs of le&s;&s;er importance directed him likewi&s;e in the choice of a wife: the woman he married had no
<PB N="18" REF="20">
merit but beauty, and brought with her to the hou&s;e of a man who&s;e fortune was already ruined nothing but a ta&s;te for luxury and expence, with|out the means of gratifying it.</P>
<P>Harriot, the elde&s;t daughter of this couple, was, like her mother, a beauty, and upon that account, as well as the conformity of her temper and incli|nations to hers, engro&s;&s;ed all her affection.</P>
<P>Sophia &s;he affected to de&s;pi&s;e, becau&s;e &s;he wanted in an equal degree tho&s;e per&s;onal attractions, which in her opinion con&s;tituted the whole of female perfec|tion. Meer common judges however allowed her per&s;on to be agreeable; people of di&s;cernment and ta&s;te pronounced her &s;omething more. The &s;triking &s;en&s;ibility of her countenance, the &s;oft elegance of her &s;hape and motion, a melodious voice in &s;peaking, who&s;e varied accents enforced the &s;en&s;ible things &s;he always &s;aid, were beauties not capable of &s;trik|ing vulgar minds, and which were &s;ure to be eclip&s;ed by the dazzling lu&s;tre of her &s;i&s;ter's com|plexion, and the fire of two bright eyes, who&s;e motions were as quick and un&s;ettled as her thoughts.</P>
<P>While Harriot was receiving the improvement of a polite education, Sophia was left to form her|&s;elf as well as &s;he could; happily for her a ju&s;t ta&s;te and &s;olid judgment &s;upplied the place of teachers, precept, and example. The hours that Harriot wa&s;ted in dre&s;s, company, and gay amu&s;e|ments, were by Sophia, devoted to reading.</P>
<P>A good old gentleman, who was nearly related to her father, perceiving this ta&s;te in her, encou|raged
<PB N="19" REF="21">
it by his prai&s;es, and furni&s;hed her with the means of gratifying it, by con&s;tantly &s;upplying her with &s;uch books as were be&s;t calculated to improve her morals and under&s;tanding. His admiration en|crea&s;ing in proportion as he had opportunities of ob&s;erving her merit, he undertook to teach her the French and Italian languages, in which &s;he &s;oon made a &s;urpri&s;ing progre&s;s; and by the time &s;he had reached her fifteenth year, &s;he had read all the be&s;t authors in them, as well as in her own.</P>
<P>By this unwearied application to reading, her mind became a beautiful &s;tore-hou&s;e of ideas: hence &s;he derived the power and the habit of con|&s;tant reflection, which at once enlarged her under|&s;tanding, and confirmed her in the principles of piety and virtue.</P>
<P>As &s;he grew older the management of the family entirely devolved upon her; for her mother had no ta&s;te for any thing but plea&s;ure, and her &s;i&s;ter was taught to con&s;ider her&s;elf as a fine lady, who&s;e beau|ty could not fail to make her fortune, and who&s;e &s;ole care it ought to be to dre&s;s to the greate&s;t ad|vantage, and make her appearance in every place where &s;he might encrea&s;e the number of her ad|mirers.</P>
<P>Sophia, in acquitting her&s;elf of the duties of a hou&s;e-keeper to her mother, &s;hewed that the high|e&s;t intellectual improvements were not incompatible with the humbler cares of dome&s;tic life: every thing that went through her hands received a grace and propriety from the good &s;en&s;e by which &s;he was directed; nor did her attention to family-affairs
<PB N="20" REF="22">
break in upon her darling amu&s;ement read|ing.</P>
<P>People who know how to employ their time well are always good economi&s;ts of it. Sophia laid out hers in &s;uch exact proportions, that &s;he had always &s;ufficient for the &s;everal employments &s;he was engaged in: the bu&s;ine&s;s of her life, like that of nature, was performed without noi&s;e, hurry, or confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The death of Mr. Darnley threw this little fa|mily into a deplorable &s;tate of indigence, which was felt the more &s;everely, as they had hitherto lived in an affluence of all things, and the debts which an expence &s;o ill proportioned to their in|come had obliged Mr. Darnley to contract, left the unhappy widow and her children without any re&s;ource. The plate, furniture, and every thing valuable were &s;eized by the creditors. Mrs. Darn|ley and her daughters retired to a private lodging, where the fir&s;t days were pa&s;&s;ed in weak de&s;pon|dence on the part of the mother, in pa&s;&s;ionate re|pinings on that of the elde&s;t daughter, and by So|phia in decent &s;orrow and pious re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley however, by a natural con&s;equence of her thoughtle&s;s temper, &s;oon recovered her former gaiety. Pre&s;ent evils only were capable of af|fecting her; reflection and foreca&s;t never di&s;turbed the &s;ettled calm of her mind. If the wants of one day were &s;upplied, &s;he did not con&s;ider what inconve|niences the next might produce. As for Harriot &s;he found re&s;ources of comfort in the exalted ideas &s;he had of her own charms; and having already laid it
<PB N="21" REF="23">
down as a maxim, that poverty was the mo&s;t &s;hame|ful thing in the world, &s;he formed her re&s;olutions accordingly.</P>
<P>Sophia, as &s;oon as her grief for the lo&s;s of her father had &s;ub&s;ided, began to con&s;ider of &s;ome plan for their future &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. She forbore however to communicate her thoughts on this &s;ubject to her mother and &s;i&s;ter, who had always affected to treat every thing &s;he &s;aid with contempt, the mean di&s;gui&s;e which envy had a&s;&s;umed to hide their con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her &s;uperior merit; but &s;he opened her mind to the good old gentleman, to whom &s;he had been obliged for many of her im|provements. She told him that being by his gene|rous cares qualified to undertake the education of a young lady, &s;he was de&s;irous of being received into the family of &s;ome per&s;on of di&s;tinction in the quality of governe&s;s to the daughters of it, that &s;he might at once &s;ecure to her&s;elf a decent e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, and be enabled to a&s;&s;i&s;t her mother. She hinted that if her &s;i&s;ter could be al&s;o prevailed upon to enter into the &s;ervice of a lady of quality, they might jointly contribute their endeavours to make their mother's life comfortable.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert prai&s;ed her de&s;ign, and promi&s;ed to mention it to Mrs. Darnley, to whom he conceived he might &s;peak with the greater freedom, as his near relation to her hu&s;band, and the long friend&s;hip which had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them, gave him a right to intere&s;t him&s;elf in their affairs. The fir&s;t words he uttered produced &s;uch an emotion in Mrs. Darn|ley's countenance, as convinced him that what he had farther to &s;ay would not be favourably re|ceived. She coloured, drew her&s;elf up with an
<PB N="22" REF="24">
air of dignity, looking at the &s;ame time at her elde&s;t daughter with a &s;cornful &s;mile.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, however, continued his di&s;cour&s;e, when Harriot, with a pertne&s;s which &s;he took for wit, interrupted him with a loud laugh, and a&s;ked him, if going to &s;ervice was the be&s;t provi&s;ion he could think of for Mr. Darnley's daughters?</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, turning ha&s;tily to her, replied with a look of great gravity, and in a calm accent, <Q>Have you, mi&s;s, thought of any thing better?</Q></P>
<P>Harriot, without being di&s;concerted, retorted very bri&s;kly,<Q>People who have nothing but advice to offer to their friends in di&s;tre&s;s, ought to be &s;ilent till they are a&s;ked for it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Good advice, mi&s;s, replied the old gentle|man with the &s;ame compo&s;ure, is what every body cannot, and many will not give; and it is at lea&s;t an in&s;tance of friend&s;hip to hazard it, where one may be almo&s;t &s;ure of its giving of|fence.</Q>
But, continued he, turning to Sophia,
<Q>my young pupil here has I hope not profited &s;o little by her reading as not to know the value of good coun&s;el; and I promi&s;e her &s;he &s;hall not only command the be&s;t that I am capable of giv|ing, but every other a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;he may &s;tand in need of.</Q>
Saying this, he bowed and went away, without any attempts from Mrs. Darnley to detain him.</P>
<P>Poor Sophia, who was &s;uppo&s;ed by her &s;ilence to have acquie&s;ced in the old gentleman's pro|po&s;al, was expo&s;ed to a thou&s;and reproaches for her meanne&s;s of &s;pirit. She attempted to &s;hew the uti|lity, and even the nece&s;&s;ity of following his advice; but &s;he found on this occa&s;ion, as &s;he had on many
<PB N="23" REF="25">
others, that with &s;ome per&s;ons it is not &s;afe to be too rea&s;onable. Her arguments were an&s;wered with rage and invective, which &s;oon &s;ilenced her, and increa&s;ed the triumph of her imperious &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, apprehen&s;ive of the ill treatment &s;he was likely to be expo&s;ed to, offered to place her in the family of a country clergyman, and to pay for her board till &s;uch a &s;ettlement as &s;he de&s;ired could be procured for her; but the tender Sophia, not willing to leave her mother while &s;he could be of any u&s;e to her, gratefully declined his offer, &s;till expecting that the increa&s;ing perplexity of their circum&s;tances might bring her to reli&s;h his rea&s;on|able coun&s;els, and that &s;he might have the &s;anction of her con&s;ent to a &s;tep which prudence made ne|ce&s;&s;ary to be taken.</P>
<P>A legacy of a hundred pounds being left her by a young lady who tenderly loved her, and who died in her arms, &s;he immediately pre&s;ented it to her mother, by whom it was received it with a tran&s;port of joy, but without any reflection upon the filial piety of her who gave it.</P>
<P>Sophia's good friend, though he did not ab&s;o|lutely approve of this exalted &s;train of tenderne&s;s, yet did not fail to place the merit of it in the fulle&s;t light; but Harriot, who never heard any prai&s;es of her &s;i&s;ter without a vi&s;ible emotion, interrupted him, by &s;aying, that Sophia had only done what &s;he ought; and that &s;he her&s;elf would have acted in the &s;ame manner, if the &s;um had been twenty times larger.</P>
<P>The &s;ame delicacy which induced Sophia to di|ve&s;t her&s;elf of any particular right to this &s;mall
<PB N="24" REF="26">
legacy, made her &s;ee the mi&s;application of it with|out di&s;covering the lea&s;t mark of di&s;like. Harriot, who governed her mother ab&s;olutely, having repre|&s;ented to her, that the ob&s;curity in which they lived was not the means to pre&s;erve their old friends, or to acquire new ones; and that it was their bu&s;ine&s;s to appear again in the world, and put them&s;elves in the way of fortune, which could not be done without making a decent appearance at lea&s;t; Mrs. Darnley, who thought this rea&s;on|ing unan&s;werable, con&s;ented to their changing their pre&s;ent lodgings for others more genteel, and to whatever expences her elde&s;t daughter judged ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;s of her &s;cheme.</P>
<P>Sophia lamented in &s;ecret this exce&s;s of impru|dence; and to avoid being a witne&s;s of it, as well as to free her mother from the expence of her maintenance, &s;he re&s;olved to accept of the fir&s;t gen|teel place that offered; but the natural &s;oftne&s;s and timidity of her temper made her delay as long as po&s;&s;ible mentioning this de&s;ign to her mother and &s;i&s;ter, le&s;t it &s;hould be con&s;trued into a tacit reproach of them for a conduct &s;o very different.</P>
<P>Indeed her condition was greatly altered for the wor&s;e, &s;ince the pre&s;ent &s;he had made of her legacy. Her mother and &s;i&s;ter had never loved her much, and their tenderne&s;s for her was now entirely lo&s;t in the unea&s;y con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having owed an ob|ligation to her, for which they could not re&s;olve to be grateful. They no longer con&s;idered her as an in&s;ignificant per&s;on who&s;e approbation or di&s;like was of no &s;ort of con&s;equence, but as a &s;aucy cen|&s;urer of their actions, who a&s;&s;umed to her&s;elf a &s;u|periority,
<PB N="25" REF="27">
on account of the paultry a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;he had offered them: every thing &s;he &s;aid was con|&s;trued into upbraidings of the benefit &s;he had con|ferred upon them. If &s;he offered her opinion upon any occa&s;ion, Harriot would &s;ay to her with a malicious &s;neer,
<Q>To be &s;ure you think you have a right to give us laws, becau&s;e we have had the misfortune to be obliged to you.</Q>
And Mrs. Darnley, working her&s;elf up to an agony of grief and re&s;entment for the fancied in&s;ult, would lift up her eyes and cry,
<Q>How much is that mother be pitied who lives to receive alms from her child!</Q></P>
<P>Poor Sophia u&s;ed to an&s;wer no oftherwi&s;e than by tears: but this was &s;ure to aggravate her fault; for it was &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;he wept and appeared afflicted only to &s;hew people what ungrateful re|turns &s;he met with for her goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus did the unhappy Sophia, with the &s;ofte&s;t &s;en&s;ibility of heart and tendered affections, &s;ee her|&s;elf excluded from the endearing expre&s;&s;ions of a mother's fondne&s;s, only by being too worthy of it, and expo&s;ed to &s;hocking &s;u&s;picions of undutifulne&s;s for an action that &s;hewed the highe&s;t filial af|fection: &s;o true it is, that great virtues cannot be under&s;tood by mean and little minds, and with &s;uch, not only lo&s;e all their lu&s;tre, but are too often mi&s;taken for the contrary vices.</P>
<P>While Sophia pa&s;&s;ed her time in melancholy re|flections, Harriot, being by her generous gift en|abled to make as &s;hewy an appearance as her mourn|ing habit would permit, again mixed in company, and laid baits for admiration. Her beauty &s;oon
<PB N="26" REF="28">
procured her a geat number of lovers; her poverty made their approaches ea&s;y; and the weakne&s;s of her under&s;tanding, her in&s;ipid gaiety, and pert af|fectation of wit, encouraged the mo&s;t licentious hopes, and expo&s;ed her to the mo&s;t impertinent addre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e who looking upon her as a conque&s;t of no great difficulty formed the mortifying de&s;ign of making a mi&s;tre&s;s of her, was Sir Charles Stanley, a young baronet of a large e&s;tate, a mo&s;t agree|able per&s;on, and engaging addre&s;s: his fine qua|lities made him the delight of all who knew him, and even envy it&s;elf allowed him to be a man of the &s;tricte&s;t honour and unblemi&s;hed integrity.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons who connect the idea of virtue and goodne&s;s with &s;uch a character, would find it hard to conceive how a man who lives in a con&s;tant cour&s;e of di&s;&s;imulation with one part of his &s;pecies, and who abu&s;es the advantages he has received from nature and fortune in &s;ubduing cha&s;tity, and en&s;naring innocence, can po&s;&s;ibly de&s;erve, and e&s;ta|bli&s;h a reputation for honour! but &s;uch are the illu|&s;ions of prejudice, and &s;uch the tyranny of cu&s;tom, that he who is called a man of gallantry &s;hall be at the &s;ame time e&s;teemed a man of honour, though gal|lantry comprehends the wor&s;t kind of fraud, cruelty, and inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Sir Charles Stanley had been but too &s;ucce&s;sful in his attempts upon beauty, to fear being rejected by Mi&s;s Darnley; and knowing her &s;ituation, he re&s;olved to engage her gratitude at lea&s;t before he declared his de&s;igns. He had intere&s;t enough to
<PB N="27" REF="29">
procure the place her father enjoyed for a gentle|man who thought him&s;elf happy in obtaining it, though charged with an annuity of four&s;core pounds a year for the widow of his predece&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, in acquainting Mi&s;s Darnley with what he had done in favour of her mother, found him&s;elf under no nece&s;&s;ity of in&s;inuating his motive for the extraordinary intere&s;t he took in the affairs of this di&s;tre&s;t family. Harriot's vanity anticipated any declaration of this &s;ort, and the thanks &s;he gave him were accompanied with &s;uch an apparent con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the power of her charms as convinced him his work was already more than half done.</P>
<P>He was now received at Mrs. Darnley's in the quality of a declared lover of Harriot's; and al|though amid&s;t all his a&s;&s;iduities he never mention|ed marriage, either the mother and daughter did not penetrate into his real de&s;igns, or were but too much di&s;po&s;ed to favour them.</P>
<P>The innocent heart of Sophia was at fir&s;t over|whelmed with joy for the happy provi&s;ion that had been made for her mother, and the pro&s;pect of &s;uch an advantageous match for her &s;i&s;ter, when Mr. Herbert, who knew the world too well to be im|po&s;ed upon by the&s;e fine appearances, gently hinted to his young favourite, his apprehen&s;ions of the baronet's di&s;honourable views.</P>
<P>Her delicacy was &s;o &s;hocked by this &s;u&s;picion, that &s;he could &s;carce forbear expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome little re&s;entment of it; but reflecting that this ardent lover of Harriot's had not yet made any propo&s;als of marriage, her good &s;en&s;e immediately &s;ugge&s;ted to her that &s;uch affected delays in a man who was
<PB N="28" REF="30">
ab&s;olutely independent, and with a woman who&s;e &s;ituation made it a point of delicacy to be early ex|plicit on that head, could only proceed from inten|tions which he had not yet dared to own.</P>
<P>Chance had &s;o ordered it, that hitherto &s;he had never &s;een Sir Charles Stanley; whenever he came, &s;he was either employed in the family-affairs, or en|gaged with her books, which it was no ea&s;y matter to make her quit. Be&s;ides, as &s;he had no &s;hare in his vi&s;its, and as her &s;i&s;ter never &s;hewed any incli|nation to introduce her to him, &s;he thought it did not become her to intrude her&s;elf upon his ac|quaintance. Sir Charles indeed, knowing that Mrs. Darnley had another daughter, u&s;ed &s;ometimes to enquire for her, but was neither &s;urpri&s;ed nor di&s;|appointed that &s;he never made her appearance.</P>
<P>Sophia, however, was determined to be in the way when he came next, that &s;he might have an opportunity of ob&s;erving his behaviour to her &s;i&s;ter; and fondly flattered her&s;elf that &s;he &s;hould di&s;cover nothing to the di&s;advantage of a per&s;on whom her grateful heart had taught it&s;elf to love and e&s;teem as their common benefactor.</P>
<P>Sir Charles at the next vi&s;it found Sophia in the room with her &s;i&s;ter. He in&s;tantly &s;aw &s;ome|thing in her looks and per&s;on which in&s;pired him with more re&s;pect than he had been u&s;ed to feel for Mrs. Darnley and Harriot; a dignity which &s;he derived from innate virtue, and an exalted under|&s;tanding. Struck with the uncommon &s;en&s;ibility of her countenance, he began to con&s;ider her with an attention which greatly di&s;gu&s;ted Harriot, who
<PB N="29" REF="31">
could not conceive that where &s;he was pre&s;ent any other object was worthy notice.</P>
<P>Sophia her&s;elf was a little di&s;concerted by the young baronet's &s;o earne&s;tly gazing on her; and in order to divert his looks, opened a conver&s;ation in which her &s;i&s;ter might bear a part. Then it was, that without de&s;igning it, &s;he di&s;played her whole power of charming: that flow of wit which was &s;o natural to her, the elegant propriety of her lan|guage, the delicacy of her &s;entiments, the animated look which gave them new force, and &s;ent them directly to the heart, and the moving graces of the mo&s;t harmonious voice in the world, were attractions, which though generally lo&s;t on fools, &s;eldom fail of their effect on the heart of a man of &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Sir Charles was wrapt in wonder and delight; he had no eyes, no ears, but for Sophia: he &s;carce perceived that Harriot was in the room.</P>
<P>The in&s;olent beauty, a&s;toni&s;hed at &s;uch unu&s;ual neglect, varied her attitude and her charms a thou|&s;and different ways to draw his attention; but found all was to no purpo&s;e. Had &s;he been capable of &s;erious reflection, &s;he might now have di&s;covered what advantages her &s;i&s;ter, though far inferior to her in beauty, gained over her, by the force of her under&s;tanding: &s;he might now have &s;een,
<Q><L>"How beauty is excelled by <HI>mode&s;t</HI> grace,</L>
<L>"And wi&s;dom, which alone is truly fair."</L></Q>
But too ignorant to know her own wants, and too conceited to imagine &s;he had any, &s;he was &s;trangely perplexed how to account for &s;o &s;udden an altera|tion in Sir Charles.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="32">Her unea&s;ine&s;s, however, grew &s;o great, that &s;he was not able to conceal it. She &s;hifted her &s;eat two or three times in a minute, bit her lips almo&s;t through, and frowned &s;o intelligibly, that Sophia at la&s;t perceiving her agitation, &s;uddenly recollected her&s;elf, and quitted the room upon pre|tence of bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>When &s;he was gone, Harriot drawing her&s;elf up, and a&s;&s;uming a look which expre&s;&s;ed her con|fidence in the irre&s;i&s;tible power of her charms, &s;eemed re&s;olved to make her lover repent the lit|tle notice he had taken of her in this vi&s;it by play|ing off a thou&s;and &s;cornful airs upon him; but &s;he was more mortified than ever when upon turning her eyes towards him, in full expectation of finding his fixed upon her, &s;he &s;aw them bent upon the ground, and &s;uch a pen&s;ivene&s;s in his countenance as all her rigors could never yet occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>She was con&s;idering what to &s;ay to him to draw him out of this reverie, when Sir Charles, on a &s;udden rai&s;ing his eyes, turned them towards the door with a look of mingled anxiety and impatience, and then, as if di&s;appointed, &s;ighed and addre&s;&s;ed &s;ome indifferent conver&s;ation to Harriot.</P>
<P>The lady, now quite provoked, had recour&s;e to an artifice which her &s;hallow under&s;tanding &s;ug|ge&s;ted to her, as an infallible method of awakening his tenderne&s;s, and this was to make him jealous. Without any preparation therefore, &s;he introduced the name of Lord L&mdash;, a young nobleman who was ju&s;t returned from his travels, and lavi&s;hing a thou&s;and encomiums upon his per&s;on, and his ele|gant ta&s;te in dre&s;s, added,
<Q>That he was the be&s;t bred man in the world, and had entertained her
<PB N="31" REF="33">
&s;o agreeably one night at the play, when happen|ing to come into a box where &s;he was with a lady of her acquaintance, that they did not mind a word the players &s;aid, he was &s;o diverting.</Q></P>
<P>Sir Charles coldly an&s;wered,
<Q>That Lord L. was a very pretty youth, and that he was intimate|ly acquainted with him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Oh then, cried Harriot, with a great deal of affected joy, I vow and prote&s;t you &s;hall bring him to &s;ee me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Indeed you mu&s;t excu&s;e me madam,</Q> &s;aid Sir Charles, with &s;ome quickne&s;s.</P>
<P>Harriot, concluding her &s;tratagem had taken ef|fect, was quite tran&s;ported, and renewed her at|tacks, determined to make him &s;uffer as much as po&s;&s;ible; but the young baronet, who&s;e thoughts were full of Sophia, and who&s;e emotion at the re|que&s;t Harriot had made him, was occa&s;ioned by fears very different from tho&s;e &s;he &s;u&s;pected, took no further notice of what &s;he &s;aid, but interrupted her to a&s;k how old her &s;i&s;ter Sophia was?</P>
<P><Q>I dare engage, replied Harriot, you would never have &s;uppo&s;ed her to be younger than I am.</Q></P>
<P>The baronet &s;miled, and looking at his watch, &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed that it was &s;o late, and took his leave.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Darnley following him to the door of the room, cried,
<Q>Remember I lay my commands upon you to bring my Lord L. to &s;ee me.</Q></P>
<P>Sir Charles an&s;wered her no otherwi&s;e than by a low bow, and &s;he returned, delighted at the part|ing pang which &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he had given him.
<PB N="32" REF="34">
Vanity is extremely ingenious in procuring gratifi|cations for it&s;elf. Harriot did not doubt but that &s;he had tormented Sir Charles &s;ufficiently; and it was the un&s;haken confidence which &s;he had in the power of her charms, that hindered her from di&s;|covering the true cau&s;e of the new di&s;gu&s;t &s;he had conceived for her &s;i&s;ter. However, it was &s;o great that &s;he could &s;carcely &s;peak to her civilly, or en|dure her in her &s;ight: yet &s;he found an increa&s;e of plea&s;ure in talking to her mother when &s;he was pre&s;ent of the violent pa&s;&s;ion Sir Charles Stanley had for her, and in giving an exaggerated account of the profe&s;&s;ions he made her.</P>
<P>Sophia did not li&s;ten to this &s;ort of di&s;cour&s;e with her u&s;ual complai&s;ance. Her mind became in&s;en|&s;ibly more di&s;po&s;ed to &s;u&s;pect the &s;incerity of the baronet's pa&s;&s;ion for her &s;i&s;ter: &s;he grew pen&s;ive and melancholy, &s;ought &s;olitude more than ever, and loved reading le&s;s.</P>
<P>This change, which her own innocence hid from her&s;elf, was quickly perceived by Mr. Herbert, who loved her with a parent's fondne&s;s, and thought nothing indifferent which concerned her. He took occa&s;ion one day to mention Sir Charles Stanley to her, and a&s;ked her opinion of his per&s;on and un|der&s;tanding, keeping his eyes fixed upon her at the &s;ame time, which di&s;concerted her &s;o much that &s;he blu&s;hed; and though &s;he commended him greatly, yet it was ea&s;y to di&s;cover that &s;he forbore to &s;ay all the good &s;he thought of him, for fear of &s;aying too much.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert no longer doubted but this dan|gerous youth had made an impre&s;&s;ion on the inno|cent
<PB N="33" REF="35">
heart of Sophia, which was &s;till ignorant of its own emotions.</P>
<P>He had perceived for &s;ome time that Sir Charles had changed the object of his pur&s;uits: his vi&s;its now were always &s;hort, unle&s;s Sophia was in the way: he brought her all the new books and pam|phlets that came out which were worth her read|ing: he adopted the purity and delicacy of her &s;entiments, declared him&s;elf always of the &s;ide &s;he e&s;pou&s;ed: he talked of virtue like a man who loved and practi&s;ed it, and &s;et all his good qualities in the faire&s;t light: he pre&s;ented Harriot from time to time with fa&s;hionable trifles, and &s;ent Sophia books enough to furni&s;h out a little library, con|&s;i&s;ting of the be&s;t authors, in Engli&s;h, French, and Italian, all elegantly bound, with proper ca&s;es for their reception: he prai&s;ed whatever &s;he ap|proved, and appeared to have great re&s;pect and con&s;ideration for Mr. Herbert, becau&s;e he ob&s;erved &s;he loved and e&s;teemed him.</P>
<P>That faithful friend of the virtuous Sophia trem|bled for her danger, when he con&s;idered that by this artful management the baronet was &s;trengthen|ing him&s;elf every day in her good opinion, and &s;e|ducing her affections under the appearance of me|riting her friend&s;hip; yet he did not think it pro|per to give her even a hint of her &s;ituation. A young maid has pa&s;&s;ed over the fir&s;t bounds of re|&s;ervedne&s;s who allows her&s;elf to think &s;he is in love.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert would not familiarize her with &s;o dangerous an idea: he knew her extreme mode&s;ty, her &s;olid virtue; he was under no apprehen&s;ions
<PB N="34" REF="36">
that &s;he would ever act unworthy of her character; but a heart &s;o nicely &s;en&s;ible, &s;o delicately tender as hers, he knew mu&s;t &s;uffer greatly from a di&s;ap|pointed pa&s;&s;ion; and this was what he wanted to prevent, not by wounding her delicacy with &s;ug|ge&s;ting to her that &s;he was in love, but by pre&s;er|ving her from the encroachments of that pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He reminded her of the de&s;ign &s;he had formerly mentioned to him of entering into the &s;ervice of a lady, and was rejoiced to find that &s;he &s;till conti|nued her re&s;olution. Harriot's natural in&s;olence and ill temper, irritated by the change &s;he now plainly &s;aw in Sir Charles, made home &s;o di&s;agree|able to Sophia, that &s;he wi&s;hed impatiently for an opportunity of providing for her&s;elf, that &s;he might no longer live upon the bounty of her &s;i&s;ter, who often in&s;inuated that their mother's annuity was her gift.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, who had other rea&s;ons be&s;ides tho&s;e &s;he urged, from freeing her from &s;o unea&s;y a de|pendance, promi&s;ed to be diligent in his enquiries for &s;omething that would &s;uit her.</P>
<P>Neither Mrs. Darnley nor Harriot oppo&s;ed this de&s;ign, which &s;oon came to the knowledge of Sir Charles, who had bribed a &s;ervant of the family to give him intelligence of every thing that pa&s;&s;ed in it.</P>
<P>Impatient to prevent the execution of it, and tortured by the bare apprehen&s;ion of Sophia's ab|&s;ence, he re&s;olved to break through that con&s;traint he had &s;o long laid upon him&s;elf, and acquaint her with his pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="37">But it was not ea&s;y to find an opportunity of &s;peaking to her alone. At length having contrived to get Harriot engaged to a play, and prevailed upon a maiden kin&s;woman of his to invite Mrs. Darnley to a party of whi&s;t, he went to the hou&s;e at his u&s;ual hour of vi&s;iting this little family, and found Sophia at home, and without any com|pany.</P>
<P>Not all the confidence he derived from his rank and fortune, his fine under&s;tanding; and tho&s;e per|&s;onal graces which gave him but too much merit in the eyes of many women, could hinder him from trembling at the thought of that declaration he was about to make. As &s;oon as he came into Sophia's pre&s;ence he was awed, di&s;concerted, and unable to &s;peak; &s;uch was the power of virtue, and &s;uch the force of a real pa&s;&s;ion! Two or three times he re|&s;olved to begin, but when he looked upon Sophia, and &s;aw in her charming eyes that &s;parkling intel|ligence which di&s;played the trea&s;ures of the &s;oul that animated them; when he ob&s;erved the &s;weet &s;everity of her mode&s;t countenance, the compo&s;ed dignity of her behaviour, he dur&s;t not own a pa&s;|&s;ion which had views le&s;s pure than the perfect creature that in&s;pired it.</P>
<P>His conver&s;ation for near an hour was &s;o confu|&s;ed, &s;o disjointed, and interrupted by &s;uch frequent mu&s;ings, that Sophia was amazed, and thought it &s;o di&s;agreeable, and unlike what it u&s;ed to be, that &s;he was not &s;orry when he &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to put an end to his vi&s;it.</P>
<P>Sir Charles indeed ro&s;e up to be gone, but with &s;o deep a concern in his eyes as increa&s;ed Sophia's
<PB N="36" REF="38">
perplexity. She attended him re&s;pectfully to the door of the room, when he &s;uddenly turning back, and taking her hand,
<Q>Do not hate me, &s;aid he, nor think ill of me, if I tell you that I love and adore you.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia, in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion at &s;uch a &s;peech, di&s;engaged her hand from his, and retiring a few &s;teps back, bent her eyes on the ground, and con|tinued &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, emboldened by her confu&s;ion, made a tender, and at the &s;ame time re&s;pectful declara|tion of the pa&s;&s;ion he had long felt for her.</P>
<P>Sophia, not willing to hear him enlarge upon this &s;ubject, rai&s;ed her eyes from the ground, her cheeks were indeed over&s;pread with blu&s;hes, but there was a grave compo&s;ure in her looks that &s;eemed a bad omen to Sir Charles.</P>
<P><Q>I have hitherto flattered my&s;elf, &s;ir, &s;aid &s;he, that you entertained a favourable opinion of me, how happens it then that I &s;ee my&s;elf to-day ex|po&s;ed to your raillery?</Q></P>
<P>The baronet was beginning a thou&s;and prote&s;ta|tions, but Sophia &s;topt him &s;hort.
<Q>If your pro|fe&s;&s;ions to me are &s;incere, &s;aid &s;he, what am I to think of tho&s;e you made to my &s;i&s;ter?</Q></P>
<P>Sir Charles expected this retort, and was the le&s;s perplexed by it, as he needed only to follow the dictates of truth to form &s;uch an an&s;wer as was proper to be given.
<Q>I acknowledge, &s;aid he, that I admired your &s;i&s;ter, and her beauty made as &s;trong an impre&s;&s;ion upon me as mere beauty can make upon a man who has a ta&s;te for higher excellencies. I &s;ought Mi&s;s Darnley's acquaint|ance.
<PB N="37" REF="39">
I was &s;o happy as to do her &s;ome little &s;ervice. I wi&s;hed to find in her tho&s;e qualities that were nece&s;&s;ary to fix my heart&mdash;Pardon my freedom, Mi&s;s Sophia, the occa&s;ion requires that I &s;hould &s;peak freely. Mi&s;s Darnley, upon a nearer acquaintance, did not an&s;wer the idea I had formed to my&s;elf of a woman whom I could love for life; and the profe&s;&s;ions I made her, as you are plea&s;ed to call them, were no more than expre&s;&s;ions of gallantry; a &s;ort of homage which beauty, even when it does not touch the heart, exacts from the tongue. My heart was not &s;o ea&s;y a conque&s;t&mdash;tell me not of raillery, when I declare that none but your&s;elf was ever capable of in&s;piring me with a real pa&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>The arrival of Mr. Herbert proved a grateful interuption to Sophia, in who&s;e innocent brea&s;t the tenderne&s;s and apparent &s;incerity of this declaration rai&s;ed emotions which &s;he knew not how to di&s;|gui&s;e.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, though grieved at this un&s;ea&s;onable vi&s;it, yet withdrew, not wholly de&s;paring of &s;uc|ce&s;s. He had heedfully ob&s;erved the changes in Sophia's face while he was &s;peaking, and thought he had rea&s;on to hope that he was not indifferent to her. Loving her as he did with ex|ce&s;&s;ive tenderne&s;s, what pure and unmixed &s;atis|faction would this thought have given him, had he not been con&s;cious that his de&s;igns were unworthy of her! The &s;ecret upbraidings of his con&s;cience di&s;quieted him amid&s;t all his flattering hopes of &s;ucce&s;s; but cu&s;tom, prejudice, the in&s;olence of fortune, and the force of example, all con&s;pired to
<PB N="38" REF="40">
&s;uppre&s;s the pleadings of honour and ju&s;tice in fa|vour of the amiable Sophia, and fixed him in the barbarous re&s;olution of attempting to corrupt that virtue which made her &s;o worthy of his love.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert having, as has been already men|tioned, interrupted the conver&s;ation between Sir Charles and Sophia, was not &s;urpri&s;ed at the young baronet's abrupt departure, as he &s;eemed preparing to go when he came in; but upon looking at So|phia, he perceived &s;o many &s;igns of confu&s;ion and perplexity in her countenance, that he did not doubt but the di&s;cour&s;e which his entrance had put an end to, was a very intere&s;ting one. He waited a moment, in expectation that &s;he would open her|&s;elf to him, but finding that &s;he continued &s;ilent and aba&s;hed, he gently took her hand, and looking tenderly upon her,
<Q>Tell me, my child, &s;aid he, has not &s;omething extraordinary happened, which occa&s;ions this confu&s;ion I &s;ee you in?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Sir Charles has indeed been talking to me, re|plied Sophia blu&s;hing, in a very extraordinary manner, and &s;uch as I little expected.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Herbert pre&s;&s;ed her to explain her&s;elf, and &s;he gave him an exact account of Sir Charles's di&s;|cour&s;e to her, without lo&s;ing a word; &s;o faithful had her memory been to all he &s;aid.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert li&s;tened to her attentively, and found &s;omething &s;o like candor and &s;incerity in the baronet's declaration, that he could not help being plea&s;ed with it. He had never indeed judged favourably of his views upon Harriot, but here the ca&s;e was very different.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="41">Harriot's ignorance, vanity, and eager de&s;ire of being admired, expo&s;ed her to the attacks of li|bertini&s;m, and excited pre&s;umptuous hopes.</P>
<P>Sophia's good &s;en&s;e, mode&s;ty, and virtue, placed her out of the reach of temptation. No one could think it &s;urpri&s;ing that a man of &s;en&s;e &s;hould make the fortune of a woman who would do ho|nour to his choice, and where there was &s;uch ex|alted merit as in Sophia, overlook the di&s;parity of circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>But ju&s;tly might it be called infatuation and folly, to rai&s;e to rank and affluence a woman of Harriot's de&s;picable turn; to make a companion for life of a hand&s;ome ideot, who thought the highe&s;t excel|lencies of the female character were to know how to dre&s;s, to dance, to &s;ing, to flutter in a drawing-room, or coquet at a play; who mi&s;took pertne&s;s for wit, confidence for knowledge, and in&s;olence for dignity.</P>
<P>While he was revolving the&s;e thoughts in his mind, Sophia looked earne&s;tly at him, plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve that what the baronet had &s;aid &s;eemed worthy his con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, who read in her looks that &s;he wi&s;hed to have his advice on this occa&s;ion, but would not a&s;k it, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould &s;eem to lay any &s;tre&s;s upon Sir Charles's declaration, told her it was very po&s;&s;ible the baronet was &s;incere in what he had &s;aid to her; that his manner of accounting for his quitting her &s;i&s;ter, was both &s;en&s;ible and can|did; that &s;he ought not to be &s;urpri&s;ed at the pre|ference he gave her over Mi&s;s Darnley, &s;ince &s;he de&s;erved it by the care &s;he had taken to improve
<PB N="40" REF="42">
her mind, and to acquire qualities which might procure her the e&s;teem of all wi&s;e and virtuous per&s;ons.</P>
<P>He warned her, however, not to tru&s;t too much to favourable appearances, nor to &s;uffer her incli|nations to be &s;o far engaged by the agreeable per|&s;on and &s;pecious behaviour of Sir Charles Stanley, as to find it painful to renounce him, if he &s;hould hereafter &s;hew him&s;elf unworthy of her good opi|nion.</P>
<P>He advi&s;ed her, when he talked to her in the &s;ame &s;train again, to refer him to her mother and to him for an an&s;wer; and told her that he would &s;ave her the confu&s;ion and perplexity of acquaint|ing her mother and &s;i&s;ter with what had happened, by taking that ta&s;k upon him&s;elf.</P>
<Q>You will, no doubt, added he, be expo&s;ed to &s;ome &s;allies of ill temper from Mi&s;s Darnley, for robbing her of a lover; for envy is more irre|concileable than hatred: but let not your &s;en&s;i|bility &s;uffer much on her account: if you deprive her of a lover, you do not deprive her of one &s;he loves: &s;he is too vain, too volatile, and too greedy of general admiration, to be affected with the lo&s;s of Sir Charles, any farther than as her pride is wounded by it: and one would ima|gine &s;he had fore&s;een this de&s;ertion, by the pains &s;he has taken about a new conque&s;t lately.</Q>
<P>Mr. Herbert was going on, when Mrs. Darnley knocked at the door. Sophia, in extreme agitation, begged him to &s;ay nothing concerning Sir Charles that evening. He promi&s;ed her he would not, and
<PB N="41" REF="43">
they all three conver&s;ed together upon indifferent things, till Harriot returned from the play.</P>
<P>Mr, Herbert then took leave of them, after in|viting him&s;elf to breakfa&s;t the next morning; which threw Sophia into &s;uch terror and confu&s;ion, that &s;he retired ha&s;tily to her own room, to conceal her di&s;order.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert came the next morning, according to his promi&s;e; and Sophia, all trembling with her apprehen&s;ions, retired immediately after breakfa&s;t. He entered upon the bu&s;ine&s;s that had brought him thither; but &s;en&s;ible that what he had to &s;ay would prove extremely mortifying to mi&s;s Harriot, he thought it not ami&s;s to &s;weeten the bitter pill he was preparing for her, by &s;acrificing a little flat|tery to her pride.</P>
<Q>You fine ladies, &s;aid he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to her with a &s;mile, are never weary of extending your conque&s;ts; but you u&s;e your power with &s;o much tyranny, that it is not &s;urpri&s;ing &s;ome of your &s;laves &s;hould a&s;&s;ume courage, at la&s;t, to break your chains. Do you know, my pretty cou&s;in, that you have lo&s;t Sir Charles Stanley; and that he has offered that heart, which you no doubt have de&s;pi&s;ed, to your &s;i&s;ter Sophia?</Q>
<P>Mi&s;s Darnley, who had bridled up at the begin|ning of this &s;peech, lo&s;t all her a&s;&s;umed dignity to|wards the end of it: her face grew pale and red by turns; &s;he fixed her eyes on the ground, her bo&s;om heaved with the violence of her agitations, and tears, in &s;pite of her, were ready to force their way.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="44">Sir Charles had indeed for a long time di&s;con|tinued his addre&s;&s;es to her, and had &s;uffered his inclination for her &s;i&s;ter to appear plainly enough; but &s;till her vanity &s;ugge&s;ted to her, that this might be all a feint, and acted only with a view to alarm her fears, and oblige her to &s;acrifice all her other admirers to him.</P>
<P>What Mr. Herbert had &s;aid therefore, &s;truck her at fir&s;t with a&s;toni&s;hment and grief; but &s;olicitous to maintain the fancied &s;uperiority of her character, &s;he endeavoured to repre&s;s her emotions; and tak|ing the hint which he had de&s;ignedly thrown out to her to &s;ave her confu&s;ion,</P>
<Q>Sir Charles has acted very wi&s;ely, &s;aid &s;he, putting on a &s;cornful look, to quit me, who al|ways de&s;pi&s;ed him, for one who has been &s;o little u&s;ed to have lovers, that &s;he will be ready to run mad with joy at the thoughts of &s;uch a conque&s;t: but after all, &s;he has only my leavings.</Q>
<P>Mr. Herbert, though a little &s;hocked at the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of her language, replied gravely,
<Q>How|ever that may be, Mi&s;s, it is certain that he has made a very open, and to all appearance, &s;incere declaration of love to Mi&s;s Sophia, who, not knowing how to mention this affair to her mo|ther her&s;elf, commi&s;&s;ioned me to acquaint her with it, that &s;he may have her directions how to behave to Sir Charles, and what to &s;ay to him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>One would have imagined, interrupted Mi&s;s Darnley eagerly, that &s;he who &s;ets up for &s;o much wit, and reads &s;o many books, might have known what to &s;ay to him.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="45">
<Q>Pray, Mi&s;s, &s;aid Mr. Herbert, what would you have had her &s;ay to Sir Charles?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Why truly, replied &s;he, I think &s;he ought to have told him that he was very impertinent, and have &s;hewn him the door.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Sure, Harriot, &s;aid Mrs. Darnley, who had been &s;ilent all this time, You forget that Sir Charles is our benefactor, and that I am obliged to him for all the little &s;upport I have.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is not likely I &s;hould forget it, retorted Mi&s;s Darnley, &s;ince I am the per&s;on who am mo&s;t obliged to him for what he has done; if I mi&s;take not, it was upon my account that he in|tere&s;ted him&s;elf in our affairs.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Well, well, Harriot, replied Mrs. Darnley, I have been told this often enough; but why &s;hould you be angry at this pro&s;pect of your &s;i&s;ter's ad|vancement?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I angry at her advancement, madam! ex|claimed Mi&s;s Harriot, not I really: I wi&s;h the girl was provided for by a &s;uitable match with all my heart; but as for Sir Charles, I would not have her &s;et her fooli&s;h heart upon him; he is only laughing at her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It may be &s;o, &s;aid Mr. Herbert, though I think Mi&s;s Sophia the la&s;t woman in the world whom a man would chu&s;e to laugh at. However, this affair is worth a little con&s;ideration&mdash;Mi&s;s So|phia, madam, pur&s;ued he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Mrs. Darnley, intends to refer Sir Charles en|tirely to you. You will be the be&s;t judge whe|ther the pa&s;&s;ion he profe&s;&s;es is &s;incere, and his intentions honourable; and I can an&s;wer for my

young cou&s;in, that &s;he will be wholly governed by your advice, &s;ince it is impo&s;&s;ible that you can give her any but what is mo&s;t advantageous to her honour and happine&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>Harriot, no longer able to &s;uppre&s;s her rage and envy, was thrown &s;o far off her guard as to bur&s;t into tears.
<Q>I cannot bear to be thus in&s;ulted, cried &s;he; and I declare if Sir Charles is permit|ted to go on with his foolery with that vain girl, I will quit the hou&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Was there ever any one &s;o unrea&s;onable as you are, Mi&s;s, &s;aid Mr. Herbert, have you not owned that you de&s;pi&s;ed Sir Charles; and if your &s;i&s;ter is a vain girl, will &s;he not be &s;ufficiently mortified by accepting your leavings, as you &s;aid ju&s;t now?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I am &s;peaking to my mother, &s;ir, replied Har|riot, with a contemptuous frown; depend upon it, Madam, pur&s;ued &s;he, that I will not &s;tay to be &s;acrificed to Mr. Herbert's favourite&mdash;either &s;he &s;hall be forbid to give Sir Charles any encourage|ment, who after all, is only laughing at her, or I will leave the hou&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>Saying this, &s;he flung out of the room, leaving her mother divided between anger and grief, and Mr. Herbert motionle&s;s with a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>

<HEAD><PB N="49" REF="53">
THE HISTORY OF THE DUTCHESS of BEAUFORT.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been a&s;&s;erted by the enemies of our &s;ex, that it is the fear of &s;hame which keeps many women virtuous. Had tho&s;e detractors lived in an age when vice cea&s;ed to incur blame in proportion as it appeared in &s;plendor, when riches procured guilt the di&s;tinction due to virtue, and indigence drew on virtue the contempt merited by guilt, when li|centiou&s;ne&s;s of conduct was the road to grandeur, and every courtezan expected to be a peere&s;s; they would be forced to confe&s;s that &s;he who in &s;uch cor|rupt times pre&s;erved a purity of manners was vir|tuous upon principle, &s;ince &s;hame was no longer to be dreaded as the attendant on vice.</P>
<P>To &s;uch of my fair readers as love virtue for her own &s;ake, I pre&s;ent the hi&s;tory of the dutche&s;s of Beaufort, mi&s;tre&s;s to Henry IV. of France. Here they will &s;ee grandeur purcha&s;ed by crimes, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with anxiety; &s;chemes of ambition carried far into futurity, &s;uddenly defeated by an immature and horrible death; and hence they may learn to rejoice in that innocence which is at once their merit and
<PB N="50" REF="54">
their reward. The amours of Henry the Great have been recorded by many writers, who, altho' they indeed abound with facts, yet are they adorned and embelli&s;hed with &s;o many circum|&s;tances as have the appearance of being imaginary, that the whole &s;eems either a tale invented to amu&s;e than a real and intere&s;ting narrative:</P>
<P>To avoid being mi&s;led by tho&s;e lively authors, I &s;hall extract the hi&s;tory of the dutche&s;s of Beaufort &s;olely from the Memoirs of the Duke de Sully, prime-mini&s;ter to Henry the Great, one of the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t virtuous men of his age; and the reader will have the plea&s;ure to &s;ee many pa&s;&s;ages in the words of that admirable writer.</P>
<P>Gabriella D'Etrees, afterwards &s;o famous under the name of <HI>Dutche&s;s of Beaufort,</HI> was de&s;cended from an ancient family in Picardy, to which the honourable po&s;t of grand-ma&s;ter of the artillery had been in a manner hereditary.</P>
<P>This young lady was &s;o exqui&s;itely beautiful, that &s;he obtained the &s;urname of Fair, to expre&s;s the pre-eminence of her charms over all tho&s;e of her &s;ex and time. Henry IV. who was born a hero, and who at the mo&s;t early age was called by fortune to the exertion of tho&s;e qualities which &s;o de&s;ervedly procured him the epithet of Great, had al&s;o the weakne&s;s of heroes, that alloy in his cha|racter otherwi&s;e &s;o truly noble which &s;erves to &s;hew us that nothing is perfect here below. Glory was not more his pa&s;&s;ion than love; and if on certain occa&s;ions he was capable of &s;acrificing his tender|ne&s;s to his fame, on others he made no &s;cruple to hazard his fame to gratify his tenderne&s;s. At the time that Henry fell in love with mademoi&s;elle
<PB N="51" REF="55">
D' Etrees, he was at war with his own &s;ubjects. Rebellion, &s;anctified by the name of religion, had given ri&s;e to the League, in which all the princes and great men of France were engaged.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of this formidable party was to exclude him from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion on account of his being a pro|te&s;tant, and Henry III. his immediate predece&s;&s;or, lo&s;t his life by the hands of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, for main|taining the rights of his injured kin&s;man. Henry, when fighting for a kingdom, found love a &s;tronger pa&s;&s;ion than ambition. An accidental &s;ight of mademoi&s;elle D' Etrees in&s;pired him with &s;o vio|lent a pa&s;&s;ion for her, that he often ri&s;qued his crown, his honour, and his life, for the &s;atisfaction of talking to her a few moments. Once in parti|cular, when he was in a manner be&s;ieged in his camp by the duke of Parma, he di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf in the habit of a pea&s;ant, and pa&s;&s;ed through the ene|my's guards to make her a &s;hort vi&s;it.</P>
<P>It is not certain whether the fair Gabriella repaid this exce&s;&s;ive tenderne&s;s with equal &s;incerity. In &s;uch attachments few women &s;eparate the lover from the king. Mademoi&s;elle D'Etrees had not under&s;tanding enough to be capable of the refinements of a de|licate pa&s;&s;ion. She was intere&s;ted, vain, and am|bitious: &s;he rai&s;ed her hopes to the throne, and not only practi&s;ed upon the weakne&s;s of Henry for this purpo&s;e, but formed cabals and intrigues to &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;s of her de&s;igns, which would in all probability have reduced her royal lover once more to the condition of an exile: yet &s;he had the addre&s;s to per&s;uade him that &s;he really loved him; or rather this thought was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to his happi|pine&s;s,
<PB N="52" REF="56">
that he a&s;&s;i&s;ted the crafty mi&s;tre&s;s in deceiv|ing him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Duke de Sully mentions, a &s;um of money which &s;he lent the king in his di&s;tre&s;&s;es. How great tho&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es were the reader may conceive by the humorous repre&s;entation which Henry him|&s;elf gave of them in the following billet to the duke of Sully <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sully's Memoirs, Vol. I. page 343, the Quarto Edition.</NOTE>.</P>
<Q>I am very near my enemies, and &s;carcely a hor&s;e to carry me into the battle, nor a complete &s;uit of armour to put on; my &s;hirts are all ragged, my doublets out at elbow, my kettle is &s;eldom on the fire, and the&s;e two la&s;t days I have been obliged to dine where I could, for my pur|veyors have informed me, that they have not wherewithal to furni&s;h my table.</Q>
<P>The king's pa&s;&s;ion for mademoi&s;elle D'Etrees was at fir&s;t &s;o far di&s;countenanced by her parents, that they kept her in a &s;evere confinement; and al|though Henry in his impatience to be with her would &s;ometimes neglect to reap the fruits of a dear bought victory, and quitting the pur&s;uit of the enemy, turn a&s;ide to the road that led to her hou&s;e, yet a di&s;tant &s;ight of her was all he could obtain. Mon&s;ieur D'Etrees, &s;uppo&s;ing his daugh|ter would be more &s;ecure from the king's at|tempts when &s;he was married, peremptorily in|&s;i&s;ted upon her giving her hand to Nicholas D'A|merval, lord of Liancourt.</P>
<P>Gabriella continued ob&s;tinate in her di&s;obedi|ence, till the king, who had made &s;ure of mon|&s;ieur de Liancourt, &s;ent her word to comply, as
<PB N="53" REF="57">
the only means of freeing her&s;elf from her pre&s;ent re&s;traint.</P>
<P>It was certainly no proof of Henry's under|&s;tanding, though a great one of that blind pa&s;&s;ion which tyranni&s;ed over his heart, that he &s;o &s;ecurely relied upon the honour of a man who, to &s;erve his de&s;igns, could con&s;ent to be a nominal hu&s;band, and upon the fidelity of a woman who entered into the mo&s;t &s;olemn engagement with a fixed purpo&s;e to break through it: however, an accident hap|pened which awakened his &s;u&s;picions. It is thus related by the duke de Sully.</P>
<Q><P>His maje&s;ty having &s;ent Alibour, his fir&s;t phy&s;ician, to vi&s;it Madame de Liancourt, who was indi&s;po&s;ed, (this was in the beginning of his addre&s;&s;es to that lady.) At his return he told the king, that &s;he was indeed a little di&s;ordered; but that he need not be unea&s;y, for the con&s;equence would be very good. <HI>But will you not bleed and purge her?</HI> &s;aid the king to him. <HI>I &s;hall be very careful of doing that,</HI> replied the old man with the &s;ame &s;implicity, <HI>before &s;he has gone half her time. How!</HI> interrupted the king, a&s;to|ni&s;hed and di&s;ordered to the la&s;t degree; <HI>what is it you &s;ay, friend? &s;urely you rave, and are not in your right &s;en&s;es</HI></P>
<P>Alibour &s;upported his a&s;&s;ertion with good proofs, which the king thought he &s;hould de&s;troy, by telling him upon what terms he was with the lady. <HI>I know not what you have done, or what you have not done,</HI> replied the old phy&s;ician with great compo&s;ure; and, for a complete proof, re|ferred him to &s;ix or &s;even months from that time.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="58">
The king quitted Alibour in great rage, and went immediately to reproach the &s;ick fair one, who, no doubt, knew well enough how to new dre&s;s all the good man had ignorantly &s;aid; for it was not perceived that any mi&s;under&s;tanding happened between the king and his mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>It is certain, however, that the event was ex|actly conformable to Alibour's prediction: but it was thought that Henry, after a more &s;trict examination, was brought to believe, that he had been mi&s;taken in his reckoning, &s;ince, in&s;tead of di&s;owning the child that madam de Liancourt lay in of at Coucy, during the &s;iege of Laon, he acknowledged it openly, and had it baptized by the name of Cae&s;ar.</P></Q>
<P>Gabriella found it no difficult matter to per&s;uade the king, that &s;he loved him alone. She affected the tender &s;olicitude of a wife for his per&s;on and &s;afety, when he left her to put him&s;elf at the head of his army; tears, &s;woonings, and pa&s;&s;ionate com|plaints, expre&s;&s;ed her &s;trong apprehen&s;ions of his danger. She continued to lend him money in his exigencies; and we find in Sully's Memoirs an order to him from the king to repay madame de Liancourt four thou&s;and crowns he had borrowed from her. It may ea&s;ily be imagined that Henry was reduced to great &s;treights when he con&s;ented to receive this a&s;&s;i&s;tance from his mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Henry, while the affairs of his kingdom were &s;till in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, and while &s;everal of the chiefs of the League were in arms again&s;t him, &s;ome of whom he was endeavouring to bring
<PB N="55" REF="59">
over to his party by negotiations, and reducing others by force, found lei&s;ure for the &s;oft anxities of love.</P>
<P>He was in Picardy, where, finding him&s;elf un|able to &s;upport the ab&s;ence of madame de Lian|court, he wrote to his faithful friend the duke of Sully, then marquis of Ro&s;ny, to conduct that lady to him.</P>
<P>In this journey the fair Gabriella was in immi|nent danger of her life. The duke of Sully gives a particular account of it, which I &s;hall tran&s;cribe for the &s;ake of the ob&s;ervation he makes at the end of it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sully's Memoirs, Vol. I. page 383, Quarto.</NOTE>.</P>
<Q><P>At Maubui&s;&s;on I met madam de Liancourt, with whom I took the road to Clermont. I rode &s;even or eight hundred paces before the litter in which this lady was, and which was followed at &s;ome di&s;tance by a great unwieldy coach that carried her women; before and behind this coach march|ed &s;everal mules loaded with baggage.</P>
<P>About a league from Clermont, where the road was very narrow, a &s;teep hill on one &s;ide, and a hanging valley on the other, leaving only room enough for two carriages to go a-brea&s;t; the coachman alighting on &s;ome occa&s;ion or other, one of the mules pa&s;&s;ing near the &s;ide of the coach after it &s;topped, by its neighing and the &s;ound of its bells, &s;o terrified the hor&s;es, which unfortunately were young and &s;kitti&s;h, that, taking the bit between their teeth, they drew the coach with &s;uch rapidity, that, meeting with two
<PB N="56" REF="60">
other mules, they overturned them in their cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The women within, &s;eeing a thousand aby&s;&s;es opened under their feet, apprehended their dan|ger, and &s;ent forth mo&s;t lamentable cries.</P>
<P>The coachman and muleteers endeavoured in vain to &s;top the hor&s;es: they were already with|in fifty paces of the litter, when madam Lian|court, alarmed by the noi&s;e, looked out, and &s;creamed aloud. I al&s;o turned back, and, trembling at the danger in which I &s;aw this lady and her attendants, without being able to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, on account of the di&s;tance I was at, <HI>Ah, friend,</HI> &s;aid I to La Font, <HI>the women will be da&s;hed in pieces, what will become of us? and what will the king &s;ay?</HI> While I was thus &s;peaking, I pu&s;hed my hor&s;e forwards with all my &s;trength; but this was u&s;ele&s;s, and I &s;hould have arrived too late.</P>
<P>By one of tho&s;e lucky chances, and which al|mo&s;t amount to a miracle, when the danger was greate&s;t, the axle-tree of the litter-wheels com|ing out of the nave by a violent &s;hock which broke the pegs, the two wheels fell on each &s;ide, and the coach to the ground, and there &s;topped: one of the hindmo&s;t hor&s;es was thrown down by the &s;hock, and kept in the other. The fore hor&s;es broke their traces, and pa&s;&s;ed &s;o clo&s;e to the litter, which was already at the extremity of the precipice, that it is plain if they had drawn the coach along with it, it would have been thrown over it.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="61">
I &s;topped them and gave them to my do|me&s;ticks to hold, after which I flew to relieve Madame de Liancourt, who was half dead with fear. I went next to the coach and a&s;&s;i&s;ted the women to get out of it: they were for having the coachman hanged; and I was complai&s;ant enough to give him two or three &s;trokes with my cane. At length their terrors being entirely di&s;|&s;ipated, and the carriage refitted, we re&s;umed our journey; and till we arrived at Clermont I continued to ride clo&s;e to Madame de Lian|court's litter.</P>
<P>The king had &s;et out for this place to meet his mi&s;tre&s;s, and arrived there a quarter of an hour after us. I did not fail to inform him im|mediately of what had happened; and while I was relating this adventure, I ob&s;erved him at|tentively, and &s;aw him grow pale and tremble. By the&s;e emotions, which I never &s;aw in him in the greate&s;t dangers, it was ea&s;y to gue&s;s the vio|lence of his pa&s;&s;ion for this lady.</P></Q>
<P>In the year 1596 the king created his mi&s;tre&s;s marchione&s;s of Monceaux: his pa&s;&s;ion for her en|crea&s;ed to &s;uch a degree that he &s;uffered no one to be ignorant of it. He pa&s;&s;ed through Paris, with this lady by his &s;ide; and by the tenderne&s;s which he took plea&s;ure to &s;hew to her in public, he &s;eemed to invite the adorations of his courtiers to this idol, who made her influence be univer&s;ally felt.</P>
<P>Gabriella, under the appearance of a di&s;intere&s;ted love for the king's per&s;on, concealed a boundle&s;s ambition, which made her not &s;cruple to &s;acrifice the honour of her royal lover to any pro&s;pect of
<PB N="58" REF="62">
aggrandizing her&s;elf. She contracted her &s;on Cae&s;ar, whom &s;he had by the king, to the opulent heire&s;s of the hou&s;e of Mercoeur.</P>
<P>The Duke of Mercoeur, who was then in arms again&s;t his &s;overeign, found him&s;elf by this alliance re&s;tored to his favour, without &s;uffering the lea&s;t diminution of his honours and e&s;tates; and Henry, anxious only to plea&s;e his mi&s;tre&s;s, conde&s;cended to treat upon almo&s;t equal terms with a rebel &s;ubject, whom he had it in his power to cru&s;h at a blow.</P>
<P>The Duke of Sully did not fail to make very lively remon&s;trances to his ma&s;ter upon this occa|&s;ion; but the whole affair was concluded before he had been made acquainted with it.</P>
<P>The ceremony of the contract was performed at Angers, with the &s;ame magnificence as if the little Cae&s;ar had been a &s;on of France born in marriage. He was then but four years old, and his betrothed wife but &s;ix.</P>
<P>The birth of a &s;econd &s;on drew from the king an increa&s;e of tenderne&s;s and honours. Gabriella now quitted the title of Marchione&s;s of Monceaux for that of Dutche&s;s of Beaufort. As &s;he had for a long time &s;et no bounds to her ambition, &s;he a&s;|pired at nothing le&s;s than being declared queen of France; and Henry's pa&s;&s;ion for her, which encrea&s;|ed every day, gave her hopes of accompli&s;hing her de&s;igns.</P>
<P>When &s;he was informed that the king's agents at Rome were commi&s;&s;ioned to &s;olicit the di&s;&s;olution of his marriage with Margaret of Valois, and that his maje&s;ty was upon the point of &s;ending the Duke of Luxembourg to that court, with the title of am|ba&s;&s;ador,
<PB N="59" REF="63">
to ha&s;ten the conclu&s;ion of it, &s;he looked upon this to be a favourable opportunity; but ap|prehen&s;ive that tho&s;e agents and the new amba&s;|&s;ador would not enter into her views, &s;he re&s;olved to get Sillery, then mini&s;ter of &s;tate, and who was already deep in her intere&s;ts, to be nominated for this emba&s;&s;y. As &s;he well knew what was mo&s;t likely to tempt him, &s;he promi&s;ed him the &s;eals at his return from Rome, and the po&s;t of Chancellor when it became vacant.</P>
<P>At this price Sillery engaged with all the oaths &s;he exacted of him to neglect nothing that might prevail upon the pope to legitimate the two chil|dren which &s;he had by Henry, and to di&s;&s;olve his marriage with Margaret.</P>
<P>This fir&s;t &s;tep taken, few ob&s;tacles remained to hinder her advancement to the throne. She ea&s;ily found rea&s;ons to make the king approve of the am|ba&s;&s;ador &s;he had cho&s;en. The Duke of Luxem|bourg was only &s;uffered to &s;et out, to be recalled as &s;oon as Sillery &s;hould be in a condition to take his place.</P>
<P>The Dutche&s;s a&s;&s;i&s;ted her&s;elf in preparing his equipages, and prevailed upon the king to give the nece&s;&s;ary orders for Sillery's appearance with all the pomp and magnificence by which the &s;ucce&s;s of his negociation might be &s;ecured.</P>
<P>To prepare the French at the &s;ame time for the change which &s;he meditated for her children, &s;he prevailed upon the king, who had no le&s;s tender|ne&s;s for them than the mother, to let the ceremony of her &s;econd &s;on's bapti&s;m be performed at Saint Germain, where the king then was, with the &s;ame

magnificence and honours which in this ceremony are only ob&s;erved to the children of France.</P>
<P><Q>Although I could pardon this lady, &s;ays the Duke of Sully, for an intoxication in which &s;he was kept by the &s;ervile re&s;pect the courtiers ex|pre&s;&s;ed for the children, and the adorations they offered to her&s;elf, yet I could not have the &s;ame indulgence for Henry, who was &s;o far from taking any mea&s;ures to undeceive her with regard to the extravagant hopes &s;he had entertained, that he gave orders for the bapti&s;m of this child with a readine&s;s that &s;hewed how agreeable the reque&s;t was to him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I declared my &s;entiments, pur&s;ues the duke, of this conduct, with great freedom; I endea|voured publickly to oppo&s;e the inferences which the courtiers would make from it in favour of the&s;e children's pretentions to the crown. The king him&s;elf, when the ceremony was over, be|came &s;en&s;ible that his orders had been exceeded; and this I had no difficulty to believe.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The child was named Alexander, as the elde&s;t had been Cae&s;ar; and the court-flatterers, by a kind of &s;econd bapti&s;m, gave him the title of <HI>Mon&s;ieur,</HI> which in France no one is permitted to bear but the king's only brother, or the pre|&s;umptive heir to the crown.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The mi&s;tre&s;s did not &s;top here; &s;he began to a&s;&s;ume all the airs of a queen: not indeed &s;o much of her own accord, for I think &s;he knew her&s;elf well enough not to have ventured on any &s;uch notion, but driven on to take that &s;tep by
<PB N="61" REF="67">
the continual &s;olicitations of her creatures and relations.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Madame de Sourdis, Cheverny, and Fre&s;ne, &s;econded her &s;o well on their parts, that it became in&s;en&s;ibly the public talk of the court, that the king was going to marry his mi&s;tre&s;s; and that it was for this purpo&s;e he was &s;oliciting his divorce at Rome.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I was &s;hocked at a report &s;o injurious to the glory of this prince; I went to him and made him &s;en&s;ible of the con&s;equence of it. He ap|peared to me affected, and even piqued at it: his fir&s;t care was to ju&s;tify Madame de Beaufort, who, he po&s;itively a&s;&s;ured me, had not contri|buted to the report; for which, all the proof he had was, that &s;he had told him &s;o.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He threw the whole blame upon Madame de Sourdis and Fre&s;ne, to whom he &s;hewed that he was capable of pardoning a conduct &s;o little re|&s;pectful to him, &s;ince although he was a&s;&s;ured they were guilty, he gave them not the &s;lighte&s;t reprimand.</Q></P>
<P><Q>One circum&s;tance added great weight to the &s;teps I took in this affair, both in public and pri|vate. Queen Margaret, with whom the affair of the approaching di&s;&s;olution of her marriage obliged me to keep a corre&s;pondence by letters, was the la&s;t who heard of what was &s;aid and done at court with regard to Madame de Beau|fort's preten&s;ions; as &s;oon as &s;he was inform|ed of them &s;he wrote to me, and gave me to under&s;tand, that &s;he had not changed her mind concerning a &s;eparation from the king; but
<PB N="62" REF="68">
that &s;he was &s;o much offended at their intending to give the place &s;he re&s;igned, to a woman &s;o in|famous as the Dutche&s;s was, by her commerce with the king, that although &s;he had at fir&s;t given her con&s;ent, without annexing any con|ditions to it, &s;he was now determined to in&s;i&s;t upon the exclu&s;ion of this woman; and no treat|ment whatever &s;hould oblige her to alter her re&s;olution. I &s;hewed this letter to the king, who judging by it how much his marriage with his mi&s;tre&s;s would irritate the be&s;t of his &s;ub|jects again&s;t him, began, in reality, to change his &s;entiments and conduct.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I was of opinion, that if madame de Beaufort was acquainted with the contents of this letter, it might probably produce the &s;ame effects upon her. I would not take this trouble upon my|&s;elf, being unwilling to meet the in&s;olence and rage of a woman, who looked upon me as a &s;tumbling block in the way of her advance|ment; but I communicated the letter to Chi|verny and Fre&s;ne, who immediately informed Madame de Sourdis of it, and &s;he almo&s;t in the &s;ame moment the Dutche&s;s of Beaufort.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But this lady's coun&s;ellors were not &s;o ea&s;ily alarmed; they were very &s;en&s;ible that the &s;tep they had undertaken to prevail upon the king, would not fail of meeting with many difficulties, and they had &s;ettled their behaviour upon each: the re&s;ult of their deliberations had been to ha&s;ten, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the conclu&s;ion of the affair, per&s;uading them&s;elves, that when it was once over, they might give it a colour that
<PB N="63" REF="69">
&s;hould make it excu&s;able; or at wor&s;t, matters might be compo&s;ed after a little talk, as always happens when things are without remedy.</Q></P>
<P><Q>They knew well the di&s;po&s;ition of the French nation, e&s;pecially the courtiers, who&s;e fir&s;t law it is to be always of the &s;ame mind with the &s;o|vereign; and who&s;e &s;tronge&s;t pa&s;&s;ion the de&s;ire of plea&s;ing him. In a word, they thought them&s;eves &s;ecure of every thing, provided the king him&s;elf did not fail them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Fre&s;ne having drawn up the warrant for the payment of the heralds, trumpeters, and other of|ficers of the crown who had attended at the ce|remony of this bapti&s;m, it was brought to me as well as the re&s;t of the coun&s;ellors, that I might give my order for its di&s;charge. As &s;oon as I ca&s;t my eyes upon this writing, a tender concern for the king's honour made me look upon it as a la&s;ting witne&s;s of his weakne&s;s, which was go|ing to be handed down to po&s;terity. I he&s;itated not a moment to return it, and cau&s;ed another to be drawn up in terms more proper.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The titles of Mon&s;ieur, &s;on of France, and all that could give any notion of that kind were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and con&s;equently the hou&s;hold fees were reduced to the ordinary &s;um, with which they were highly di&s;&s;atisfied. They did not fail to renew their efforts; and in their di&s;content quoted mon&s;ieur de Fre&s;ne, and the law by which their claims were regulated. At fir&s;t I re&s;trained my&s;elf before the&s;e people, who&s;e bad intentions I was not ignorant of; but growing impatient at la&s;t, I could not help &s;aying to

them with &s;ome indignation, <HI>Go, go, I will do nothing in it; learn that there are no &s;ons of France</HI></Q></P>
<P>This firmne&s;s in Sully was the occa&s;ion of a quarrel between the king and the fair Gabriella. The duke relates it at large in his memoirs; and the whole pa&s;&s;age being extremely curious, I &s;hall give my readers the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing it here.</P>
<P>The duke continues thus.
<Q>No <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sully's memoirs, vol. I. p. 40.</NOTE> &s;ooner had the&s;e words e&s;caped me, than, &s;u&s;pecting that a trouble&s;ome affair would be made of it; to prevent it I went immediately to his maje&s;ty, who was walking with the duke D'Epernon in the palace of Saint-Germain. I &s;hewed him the warrant Fre&s;ne had drawn up, telling him, that if it was allowed, there needed no more but to declare him&s;elf married to the dutche&s;s of Beaufort. <HI>This is Fre&s;ne's malice,</HI> &s;aid the king, after he had read it, <HI>but I &s;hall take care to prevent it</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Then commanding me to tear the paper, he turned to three or four lords of the court who were neare&s;t him.</HI> How malignant are the&s;e peo|ple, <HI>&s;aid he aloud,</HI> and what difficulties do they throw in the way of tho&s;e who &s;erve me with fide|lity? they brought a warrant to mon&s;ieur de Ro&s;|ney, with a de&s;ign to make him offend me, if he pa&s;&s;ed it; or my mi&s;tre&s;s, if he refu&s;ed it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In the &s;tate affairs then were, the&s;e words were far from being indifferent; they gave the
<PB N="65" REF="71">
courtiers, who had &s;miled at my &s;implicity, to under&s;tand that they might po&s;&s;ibly be deceived them&s;elves, and that the &s;uppo&s;ed marriage was not &s;o near as they had imagined.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The king continuing to conver&s;e with me apart, told me, that he did not doubt but that madame de Beaufort was greatly enraged again&s;t me, and advi&s;ed me to go to her, and endea|vour by &s;olid rea&s;ons to give her &s;atisfaction. <HI>If that will not do, added he, I will &s;peak to her as her ma&s;ter.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>I went directly to the dutche&s;s's apartment, which was in the cloi&s;ter of Saint-Germain; I knew not what notion &s;he conceived of a vi&s;it, which &s;he found I began with a &s;ort of explana|tion. She did not allow me to go on; the rage with which &s;he was animated not permitting her to ob&s;erve any mea&s;ures, &s;he interrupted me with a reproach that I had impo&s;ed on the king, and made him believe that black was white.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>'Tis well, madam,</HI> &s;aid I, interrupting her in my turn, but with great calmne&s;s, <HI>&s;ince you think fit to talk in this manner, I &s;hall take my leave, but I &s;hall not however, neglect to do my duty</HI> Say|ing this, I left her, not being willing to hear more, that I might not be tempted to &s;ay any thing &s;everer. I put the king in a very ill humour with his mi&s;tre&s;s, when I repeated to him what &s;he &s;aid. <HI>Come along with me,</HI> &s;aid the king, with an emotion that plea&s;ed me greatly, <HI>and I will let you &s;ee that women do not wholly po&s;|&s;e&s;s me</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="72">
<Q>His coach not being ready &s;oon enough for his impatience, his maje&s;ty got into mine, and as we drove to the dutche&s;s's lodgings, he told me that he would never have cau&s;e to reproach him&s;elf, that, through his complai&s;ance for a wo|man, he had bani&s;hed, or even di&s;gu&s;ted &s;ervants, who, like me, were only &s;olicitous for his glory and intere&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Madame de Beaufort, upon my leaving her apartment &s;o ha&s;tily, had expected to &s;ee the king &s;oon after; and during that time had taken &s;ufficient pains to adorn her per&s;on; believing like me that the victory which one or other of us was to gain would be the happy or mi&s;erable pre&s;age of her fortune.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As &s;oon as &s;he was informed of the kind's ar|rival, &s;he came as far as the door of the fir&s;t hall to receive him. Henry without &s;aluting her, or &s;hewing any part of his u&s;ual tender|ne&s;s, <HI>Let us go, madam,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>to your chamber, and &s;uffer no one to enter but your&s;elf, Ro&s;ney, and me, for I want to talk to you both, and make you live together upon friendly terms</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>Then ordering the door to be &s;hut, and that no one &s;hould be &s;uffered to remain in the chamber, wardrobe, or clo&s;et, he took her hand, holding one of mine at the &s;ame time, and with an air that &s;he had good rea&s;on to be &s;urpri&s;ed at, told her, that the true motive which had determined him to attach him&s;elf to her, was the gentlene&s;s he had ob&s;erved in her di&s;po&s;ition; but that her conduct for &s;ome time pa&s;t, had convinced him, that what he had believed to be real was only di&s;|&s;embled;
<PB N="67" REF="73">
and that &s;he had deceived him: he reproached her with the bad coun&s;els &s;he had li&s;tened to, and the very con&s;iderable faults they had occa&s;ioned.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He loaded me with prai&s;es, to &s;hew the dutche&s;s, by the difference of our proceedings, that I only had a true affection for his per&s;on: he commanded her to &s;ubdue her aver&s;ion for me &s;o far as to be able to regulate her conduct by my advice, &s;ince &s;he might depend upon it his pa&s;&s;ion for her &s;hould never induce him to bani&s;h me from his pre&s;ence.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Madame de Beaufort began her an&s;wer with &s;ighs and tears. She affected a tender and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive air: &s;he would have ki&s;&s;ed the hand of Henry; omitting no artifice which &s;he thought capable of melting his heart. It was not till &s;he had played over all the&s;e little arts, that &s;he be|gan to &s;peak, which &s;he did by complaining, that in&s;tead of tho&s;e returns &s;he might have ex|pected from a prince to whom &s;he had given her heart, &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf &s;acrificed to one of his grooms.</Q></P>
<P><Q>She recapitulated all that I had done again&s;t her children, in order to awake his maje&s;ty's re&s;entment again&s;t me; then feigning to &s;ink under the violence of her grief and de&s;pair, &s;he let her&s;elf fall upon a couch, where &s;he prote&s;t|ed &s;he was determined to die, not being able to endure life after &s;o cruel an affront.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The attack was a little &s;trong. Henry did not expect it: I ob&s;erved him heedfully, and &s;aw his countenance change; but recovering him|&s;elf
<PB N="68" REF="74">
immediately, that his mi&s;tre&s;s might not perceive it, he continued to tell her in the &s;ame tone, that &s;he might &s;pare her&s;elf the trouble of having recour&s;e to &s;o many artifices on &s;o &s;light an occa&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Sen&s;ibly affected at this reproach, &s;he redou|bled her tears, crying that &s;he plainly perceived &s;he was abandoned; and that doubtle&s;s it was to augment her &s;hame and my triumph, that the king had re&s;olved to make me a witne&s;s of the &s;evere&s;t behaviour that ever was &s;hewn to a woman.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This thought &s;eemed to plunge her into a real de&s;pair. <HI>By heaven, madam,</HI> &s;aid the king, lo&s;|ing patience, <HI>this is too much. I know to what all this artifice tends: you want to prevail upon me to bani&s;h a &s;ervant who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance I cannot be without; I declare to you if I was reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of chu&s;ing to lo&s;e one or the other, I would rather part with ten mi&s;tre&s;&s;es like you, than one &s;er|vant &s;uch as him.</HI> He did not forget the term of groom which &s;he had made u&s;e of; and was &s;till more offended, that &s;he had applied it to a man who&s;e family had the honour of being allied to his own.</Q></P>
<P><Q>After this har&s;h &s;peech the king quitted the dutche&s;s &s;uddenly, and was going out of her apartment, without &s;eeming to be moved at the condition he left her in; probably becau&s;e he knew her well enough to be &s;en&s;ible that all this violence of grief was affectation and gri|mace.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="75">
<Q>As for me, I was &s;o far deceived by it, as to be greatly concerned for her, and was not drawn out of this error, till madam de Beaufort, per|ceiving the king was going to leave her &s;o much offended, that &s;he had rea&s;on to apprehend he would never return again, changed her beha|viour in an in&s;tant, ran to &s;top him, and threw her&s;elf at his feet, no longer to impo&s;e upon his tenderne&s;s, but to &s;ooth him to a forgetfulne&s;s of her fault. She began by apologi&s;ing for her pa&s;t conduct, a&s;&s;umed an air of gentlene&s;s and complacency, and vowed &s;he never had, nor ever would have any will but his.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Never was there a change of &s;cene more &s;ud|den! I now &s;aw a woman perfectly agreeable, ea&s;y, and compliant, who acted towards me as if all that had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed had been a dream; and we &s;eparated very good friends.</Q></P>
<P>The dutche&s;s of Beaufort however &s;till entertain|ed hopes of being queen of France. She employ|ed every artifice which her own cunning and the more &s;ubtile policy of her relations &s;ugge&s;ted to her to &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;s of her de&s;igns. The king having recovered from a dangerous fit of illne&s;s, &s;he engaged his fir&s;t phy&s;ician, who was ab&s;olutely devoted to her, to per&s;uade him that he could have no more children.</P>
<P>She had practi&s;ed &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully upon &s;ome of his mini&s;ters of &s;tate, that they made no &s;cruple to advi&s;e Henry to &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion by marrying the dutche&s;s, and legitimating the elde&s;t of the chil|dren which he had by her.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="76">That the king was but too well di&s;po&s;ed to ad|mit this coun&s;el appears by the following conver&s;a|tion which he had with the duke of Sully, who of all his mini&s;ters was the only one that had courage and re&s;olution enough to oppo&s;e a de&s;ign &s;o inju|rious to his honour.</P>
<P><Q>The king, &s;ays the duke of Sully <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sully's Memoirs, Vol. I. Page 462, Quarto.</NOTE>, at cer|tain intervals, appeared &s;o pen&s;ive and re&s;erved, that it was not difficult to gue&s;s &s;ome &s;ecret un|ea&s;ine&s;s preyed upon his mind; and I was the more convinced of it, when his maje&s;ty, who often diverted him&s;elf with hunting, ordered me twice to follow him apart, that he might have an opportunity of conver&s;ing with me alone; yet when I did he was &s;ilent.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I then remembered that the &s;ame thing had happened at Saint Germain and Angers; and I concluded that he had a de&s;ign in view, which he had &s;ome difficulty to di&s;clo&s;e to me, know|ing with what freedom I &s;ometimes oppo&s;ed his opinions; but what this de&s;ign was I could not gue&s;s. Returning from a vi&s;it to the duke of Bouillon, his maje&s;ty being at the foot of the &s;tair ca&s;e, &s;aw me as I entered the court, and calling me, made me go with him into the gar|den, which was extremely large and beautiful, holding my hand with his finger between mine as u&s;ual, then ordered the door to be &s;hut, and that no per&s;on &s;hould be allowed to enter.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This prelude made me expect to hear a &s;ecret of great con&s;equence. Henry did not enter upon
<PB N="71" REF="77">
it immediately; but, as if he had not &s;ufficient re&s;olution to explain him&s;elf, began to tell me what had ju&s;t happened between him and the duke of Bouillon. This conver&s;ation was fol|lowed by news relating to the negotiations of Vervins, and led him in&s;en&s;ibly to reflect on the advantages France would receive from a peaceable government.</Q></P>
<P><Q>One circum&s;tance the king &s;aid gave him great unea&s;ine&s;s, which was, that not having children by the queen his wife, it would an&s;wer no purpo&s;e to be at &s;o much trouble to procure peace and tranquility to his kingdom, &s;ince, after his death, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily fall into its form|er calamities, by the di&s;putes that would ari&s;e between the prince of Cond&eacute;, and the other princes of the blood, concerning the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown.</Q></P>
<P><Q>His maje&s;ty confe&s;&s;ed to me, that this was his motive for de&s;iring with &s;uch ardour to leave &s;ons behind him. Unle&s;s his marriage with the prince&s;s Margaret could be di&s;&s;olved, it was not po&s;&s;ible for him to be ab&s;olutely happy; but the informations he received from the archbi&s;hop of Urbin, Me&s;&s;. du Perron, D'O&s;&s;at, and de Mar|quemont, his deputies at Rome, of the pope's favourable di&s;po&s;itions in re&s;pect to that affair, gave him great hopes of its &s;ucce&s;s. In effect, Clement the Eighth, who was as good a politi|cian as any prince in Europe, revolving in his mind what means were mo&s;t likely to hinder France and the other chri&s;tian kingdoms from falling again into a &s;tate of anarchy and confu|&s;ion, could find none &s;o effectual as to &s;ecure
<PB N="72" REF="78">
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown of France, by au|thori&s;ing Henry to engage in a &s;econd marriage, which might produce him male children.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Our conver&s;ation being fixed upon this &s;ub|ject, it was ea&s;y for me to perceive that it was from hence his maje&s;ty's unea&s;ine&s;s proceeded; but I could not &s;o &s;oon know what was the par|ticular thing that di&s;turbed him. The king be|gan to con&s;ider with me what prince&s;s of Europe he &s;hould chu&s;e for his wife, in ca&s;e his marriage with Margaret of Valois &s;hould be di&s;&s;olved; but indeed he &s;et out with a declaration that &s;hewed, that any reflections on that head would be fruitle&s;s.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That I may not repent, &s;aid he, of taking &s;o dangerous a &s;tep, nor draw upon my&s;elf a misfortune, which is with ju&s;tice &s;aid to exceed all others, that of having a wife di&s;agreeable in per&s;on and mind; it is nece&s;&s;ary that in her I marry, I &s;hould find the&s;e &s;even things, beauty, prudence, &s;oftne&s;s, wit, fruit|fulne&s;s, riches, and a royal birth.</Q></P>

England, if, as it is publickly &s;aid, that crown really belongs to her, &s;he were only declared pre&s;umptive heire&s;s of it; but there is no rea&s;on to expect that either of the&s;e things will happen. I have al&s;o heard of &s;ome prince&s;&s;es of Germany, who&s;e names I have forgot; but the women of this country don't &s;uit me; I &s;hould always fancy I had a hog&s;head of wine in bed with me: be&s;ides, I have been told that France had once a queen of that country, who had like to have ruined it. All the&s;e con&s;iderations have given me a di&s;|gu&s;t to the German ladies. The &s;i&s;ters of Prince Maurice have likewi&s;e been mentioned to me; but be&s;ides that they are prote&s;tants, which would give umbrage to the court of Rome, and the more zealous catholics, they are daughters of a nun, which, to|gether with a certain rea&s;on that I will inform you of &s;ome other time, has prevented my entertaining any thoughts of them. The Duke of Florence has a niece who is &s;aid to be hand&s;ome, but &s;he is de&s;|cended from one of the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable families in Chri&s;tendom, that bear the title of prince; it not being above three-&s;core or four-&s;core years &s;ince her ance&s;tors were only the fir&s;t citizens of Florence: &s;he is likewi&s;e of the &s;ame race with the queen-mother Catherine, who did &s;o much mi&s;chief to France, and to me in particular.</Q></P>

It was propo&s;ed, at the time of the &s;iege of Paris, for her to marry Henry IV. in order to unite the two parties. The &s;arca&s;tical lampoons of that time charge her with carry|ing on an intrigue with the duke of Bellegarde, ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e; and what Henry &s;ays here of <HI>poulets</HI> is taken from a &s;ong that was made again&s;t mademoi&s;elle de Gui&s;e.</NOTE>, notwith&s;tanding the malicious reports that have been &s;pread that &s;he loves poulets <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The je&s;t turns upon the word <HI>poulet,</HI> which in French &s;ig|nifies either a chicken or a love-letter.</NOTE> in paper bet|ter than in a frica&s;&s;ee; for my part, I not only be|lieve tho&s;e reports to be fal&s;e, but &s;hould rather chu&s;e a wife who is a little fond of gallantry, than one who wanted under&s;tanding; but I am apprehen&s;ive that the violent affection which &s;he di&s;covers for her family, particularly for her brothers, would create &s;ome di&s;orders in the kingdom.</Q></P>
<P><Q>After this the king named all the other prin|ce&s;&s;es in France, but to as little purpo&s;e: he acknowledged that &s;ome were beautiful, and genteel, &s;uch as the elde&s;t of the Duke of Maienne's two daughters, although of a brown complexion; the two daughters likewi&s;e of the Duke of Aumale, and three of the Duke of Lon|gueville; but all the&s;e were either too young, or were not to his ta&s;te.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He afterwards named Mademoi&s;elle Rohan, the Prince&s;s of Conti's daughter, of the hou&s;e of Luc&eacute;, Mademoi&s;elles Luxembourg and Gu&eacute;|men&eacute;; but the fir&s;t was a prote&s;tant, and the &s;econd not old enough; and the per&s;ons of the

two others did not plea&s;e him; and all for &s;ome rea&s;on or other were excluded.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The king clo&s;ed this enumeration by &s;aying, that although the&s;e ladies might be all agreeable enough to him in their per&s;ons, he &s;aw no way to be a&s;&s;ured that they would bring him heirs, or that he could &s;uit him&s;elf to their tempers, or be convinced of their prudence, three of the &s;even conditions, without which he had re&s;olved never to marry; &s;ince, if he entered into an en|gagement of that kind, it would be with a de|&s;ign to give his wife a &s;hare in the management of all his dome&s;tick affairs; and that, if according to the cour&s;e of nature, he &s;hould die before her, and leave chldren very young behind him, it would be nece&s;&s;ary that &s;he &s;hould be able to &s;uperintend their education, and govern the kingdom during a minority.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Weary at length of endeavouring to no pur|po&s;e to find out what the king aimed at by this di&s;cour&s;e;</HI> But what do you mean, Sire, &s;aid I, by &s;o many affinitives and negatives; and what am I to conclude by them, but that you are de&s;irous to marry, and yet cannot find a woman upon earth qualified to be your wife? By the manner in which you mentioned the Infanta Clara Eugenia, it &s;hould &s;eem that great heire&s;&s;es are mo&s;t agreeeable to you; but can you expect that heaven &s;hould rai&s;e a Margaret of Flanders, or a Mary of Burgundy from the dead for you; or at lea&s;t re&s;tore the Queen of England to her youth?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I added &s;miling, that for proof of the other qua|lities that he demanded, I &s;aw no better expedient
<PB N="76" REF="84">
than to bring all the beauties of France together, from the age of &s;eventeen to that of twenty-five, that by talking with them in per&s;on, he might know the turn of their temper and genius; and that for the re&s;t he &s;hould refer him&s;elf to experienced ma|trons, to whom recour&s;e is had on &s;uch occa&s;ions.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Then beginning to talk more &s;eriou&s;ly, I de|clared that, in my opinion, his maje&s;ty might contract his expectations, by &s;triking off a great fortune and royal birth, and be &s;atisfied with a wife who might keep his heart, and bring him fine children; but that here again he mu&s;t content him&s;elf with mere probability, there be|ing many beautiful women incapable of child-bearing; and many illu&s;trious fathers unhappy in their offspring: but whatever his children &s;hould prove, the blood from which they &s;prung would &s;ecure the re&s;pect and obedience of the French nation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Well, interrupted the king, &s;etting a&s;ide your ad|vice concerning this a&s;&s;embly of beauties, with which I am mightily diverted, and your &s;age reflection, that great men have often children who po&s;&s;e&s;s none of their qualities, I hope to have &s;ons who&s;e actions &s;hall exceed mine. Since you confe&s;s that the lady whom I marry ought to be of an excellent temper, beautiful in her per&s;on, and of &s;uch a make as to give hopes of bringing children; con&s;ider a little, whether you do not know a per&s;on in whom all the&s;e qualities are united.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I replied, that I would not take upon me to decide ha&s;tily upon a choice wherein &s;o much con|&s;ideration
<PB N="77" REF="85">
was requi&s;ite, and to which I had not yet &s;ufficiently attended.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And what would you &s;ay, returned Henry, if I &s;hould name one, who, I am fully convinced po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;es the&s;e three qualities?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I would &s;ay, &s;ire, replied I, with great &s;impli|city, that you are much better acquainted with her than I am, and that &s;he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be a widow, otherwi&s;e you can have no certainty, with regard to her fruitfulne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This is all you would de&s;ire, <HI>&s;aid the king;</HI> but if you cannot gue&s;s who &s;he is, I will name her to you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Name her then, &s;aid I, for I own I have not wit enough to find out who &s;he is.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ah! how dull you are, <HI>cried the king;</HI> but I am per&s;uaded you could gue&s;s who I mean if you would, and only affect this ignorance to oblige me to name her my&s;elf; confe&s;s then that the&s;e three qualities meet in my mi&s;tre&s;s; not <HI>(pur&s;ued the king in &s;ome confu&s;ion, at this di&s;covery of his weakne&s;s)</HI> that I have any intention to marry her, but I want to know what you would &s;ay, if, not being able to meet with any other whom I could approve of, I &s;hould one day take it into my head to make her my wife.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It was not difficult for me to di&s;cover, amid&s;t the&s;e &s;light artifices, that his maje&s;ty had already thought of it but too much, and was but too well di&s;po&s;ed to this unworthy marriage, which every thing he had &s;aid tended to excu&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="86">
<Q>My a&s;toni&s;hment was indeed very great, but I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to conceal my thoughts with the utmo&s;t care. I affected to believe that he was je&s;ting, that I might have an opportu|nity of an&s;wering in &s;uch a manner as might make the king a&s;hamed of having entertained &s;o extravagant a notion.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>My di&s;&s;imulation did not &s;ucceed; the king had not made &s;o painful an effort to &s;top there.</HI> I command you, <HI>&s;aid he to me,</HI> to &s;peak freely, you have acquired the right of telling me plain truths; do not apprehend that I &s;hall be offended with you for doing &s;o, provided that it is in private; &s;uch a liberty in public would greatly offend me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I replied that I would never be &s;o imprudent as to &s;ay any thing in private, any more than in public, that might di&s;plea&s;e him, except on &s;uch occa&s;ions when his life or the good of the &s;tate was in que&s;tion. I afterwards repre&s;ented to him the di&s;grace &s;o &s;candalous an alliance would draw upon him, in the opinion of the whole world, and the reproaches he would &s;uffer from his own mind upon that account, when the ar|dour of his pa&s;&s;ion being abated, he &s;hould be able to judge impartially of his own conduct.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I &s;hewed him that if this was the only means he could have recour&s;e to, to free France from the calamities a doubtful &s;ucce&s;&s;ion would pro|duce, that he would expo&s;e him&s;elf to all the in|conveniences he was anxious to avoid, and others &s;till greater. That although he &s;hould legiti|mate the children he had by madame de Lian|court, yet that could not hinder the elde&s;t, who
<PB N="79" REF="87">
was born in a double adultery, from being in this re&s;pect, inferior to the &s;econd, who&s;e birth was attended with but half of that di&s;grace, and both mu&s;t yield to tho&s;e whom he might have by madam de Liancourt, after &s;he was his lawful wife; it being therefore impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ettle their claims, they could not fail of becoming an inexhau&s;tible &s;ource of quarrels and war. <HI>I leave you, &s;ire,</HI> pur&s;ued I, <HI>to make reflections upon all this, before I &s;ay any more</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>That will not be ami&s;s, <HI>returned the king, who was &s;truck with my arguments,</HI> for you have &s;aid enough of this matter for the fir&s;t time.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But &s;uch was the tyranny of that blind pa&s;|&s;ion, with which he was inflamed, that in &s;pite of him&s;elf he renewed the &s;ubject that very mo|ment by a&s;king me, if, from the di&s;po&s;ition I knew the French to be of, e&s;pecially the nobi|lity, I thought he had any rea&s;on to apprehend they would ri&s;e in rebellion while he was living, if he &s;hould marry his mi&s;tre&s;s.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This que&s;tion convinced me, that his heart had received an incurable wound. I treated him accordingly, and entered into arguments and expo&s;tulations, with which I &s;hall not trou|ble the reader, &s;ince his own imagination may &s;ugge&s;t to him all that it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay upon this occa&s;ion; and this &s;ubject has been al|ready dwelt upon too long. We continued three hours alone in the garden, and I had the con&s;olation to leave the king in a full per&s;ua&s;ion of the truth and rea&s;onablene&s;s of all I had &s;aid to him.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="88">
<Q>The difficulty lay in breaking tho&s;e two powerful ties; the king had not yet brought him&s;elf to that point; he had many dreadful conflicts of mind to &s;uffer e'er that could be ef|fected; and all he could do for the pre&s;ent, was to defer taking his la&s;t re&s;olution till he had ob|tained the permi&s;&s;ion he had been &s;o long &s;ollicit|ing from the pope, and till then to keep his &s;entiments &s;ecret.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He promi&s;ed me not to acquaint his mi&s;tre&s;s with what I had &s;aid, le&s;t it &s;hould draw her re|&s;entment upon me. <HI>She loves you,</HI> &s;aid the king to me, <HI>and e&s;teems you &s;till more; but her mind &s;till entertains &s;ome remains of di&s;tru&s;t, that you will not approve of my de&s;ign in favour of her and her children: &s;he often tells me, that when one hears you perpetually carrying in your mouth my kingdom and my glory; one is apt to think that you prefer the one to my per&s;on, and the other to my quiet.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>I an&s;wered, that again&s;t this charge I would make no defence; that the kingdom and the &s;o|vereign were to be looked upon with the &s;ame eyes.</HI> Remember, &s;ire, <HI>added I,</HI> that your virtue is the &s;oul that animates this great body, which mu&s;t by its &s;plendor and pro&s;perity repay you that glory which it derives from you, and that you are not to &s;eek happine&s;s by any other means.</Q></P>

<HEAD>THE LADY's MUSEUM.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The TRIFLER. [NUMBER II.]</HEAD>
<P>_FROM the account I have already given of my temper and inclinations, it will be readily &s;uppo&s;ed that the love of power, which our great &s;atiri&s;t a&s;&s;erts to be the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of my &s;ex, is not the lea&s;t prevailing one of mine; and therefore I will candidly acknowledge that the too perceptible decline of our influence has often been the &s;ubject of much painful reflection to me.</P>
<P>We live no longer in tho&s;e happy times, when to recover one &s;tolen fair one, whole nations took up arms; when the &s;mile of beauty was more power|ful than the voice of ambition; when heroes con|quered to de&s;erve our favour, and poets preferred the myrtle to the laurel crown.</P>
<P>In this degenerate age in&s;tances of dying for love are very rare, and in&s;tances of marrying for
<PB N="82" REF="90">
love are &s;till rarer. Formerly, if a lady had com|manded her lover to bring her the head of a lion, he would have gone to Africa in &s;earch of the &s;avage conque&s;t, though death were to have been the con&s;equence of his obedience: but now, what lady would pre&s;ume &s;o much upon her authority, as to exact from her lover the &s;acrifice of a party at whi&s;t, or a match at Newmarket!</P>
<P>However de&s;irous I am to find the cau&s;e of this decline of our empire in the depraved man|ners of the men, yet ju&s;tice obliges me to own that we our&s;elves are not wholly free from blame. Beauty, like the maje&s;ty of kings, weakens its in|fluence when familiari&s;ed to common view. The face that may be &s;een every morning at auctions, at public breakfa&s;tings, and in crouded walks; every evening at a&s;&s;emblies, at the play, the opera, or &s;ome other fa&s;hionable &s;cene of plea&s;ure, &s;oon lo&s;es the charm of novelty, and effaces the im|pre&s;&s;ion it fir&s;t made. We may gaze upon a fine picture till the grace of the attitude, the loveline&s;s of the features, and the &s;trength of the colouring cea&s;e to &s;urpri&s;e and delight us; and unhappily ma|ny of our pre&s;ent race of beauties are too &s;olicitous about their per&s;onal charms to attend to the im|provement of their minds: &s;o that a fine woman is indeed often no more than a fine picture.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved, that there is no country in the world where women enjoy &s;o much liberty as in England, and none where their &s;way is &s;o little acknowledged. In Spain, where the &s;evere father, and jealous brother, guard the &s;ecluded maid from all conver&s;e with men, &s;he will conquer more hearts by being &s;een once without a veil, than one of our
<PB N="83" REF="91">
beauties, who appears with her neck and &s;houlders uncovered at every place of publick re&s;ort during the whole &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>The Spani&s;h lover pa&s;&s;es whole nights at his mi|&s;tre&s;s's door, and employs &s;ighs, tears, &s;erenades, and tender complaints to move her companion; bribes the vigilant duenna with half his e&s;tate to procure him a &s;hort interview at a grated window: and for this ine&s;timable favour he expo&s;es him&s;elf to the rage of her relations, who probably &s;tand ready to puni&s;h his pre&s;umption with death; while he, re|gardle&s;s of the in&s;idious &s;tab, contemplates her by the faint light of the moon, with enthu&s;ia&s;tic rap|ture.</P>
<P>For her &s;ake he enters the dreadful li&s;ts, and en|counters the fierce&s;t bull of Andalu&s;ia; the &s;pec|tators tremble at his danger; he looks up to the balcony where &s;he is &s;tated, and catches forti|tude from her eyes. Should he be wounded in the unequal combat, a &s;ign from her gives him new force and courage: again he a&s;&s;ails his furious antagoni&s;t, and drives him bellowing about the field. The lady waves her handkerchief to him as a token of her joy for his victory; the lover, half dead with fatigue and lo&s;s of blood, but triumph|ing more in that in&s;tance of her regard for him than in the loud acclamations he hears on every &s;ide, turns to the place where &s;he &s;tands, ki&s;&s;es his &s;word, and is carried out of the li&s;ts.</P>
<P>Thus ardent are the flames which love in&s;pires in a country where the promi&s;cuous a&s;&s;embly, the wrangling card-table, the licentious comedy, and late protracted ball, are not permitted to rob
<PB N="84" REF="92">
beauty of its mo&s;t engaging charms, the blu&s;h of un&s;ullied mode&s;ty, and the &s;oft dignity of female re&s;erve.</P>
<P>With us the lover dre&s;&s;es at his mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;ings, dances, and coquets with her, expects to dazzle her with &s;uperior charms, and loves her for the &s;u|perficial qualities he admires in him&s;elf. He hopes not to gain her heart in reward of his &s;ervices and con&s;tancy, but claims it as a price due to the re&s;i&s;tle&s;s graces of his per&s;on.</P>
<P>Such is the low &s;tate of our power at pre&s;ent, and &s;uch it will continue till our own prudence and re&s;erve &s;upply the place of impo&s;ed retiredne&s;s, and throw as many difficulties in the lover's way as the tyranny of cu&s;tom does in other countries. Beauty, like the Parthian archer, wounds &s;ure&s;t when &s;he flies, and we then mo&s;t certain of victo|ry when we have not courage enough to invite the attack.</P>

<HEAD>Conclu&s;ion of the <HI>HISTORY</HI> of the <HI>DUTCHESS</HI> of <HI>BEAUFORT</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Dutche&s;s of Beaufort was not ignorant that the Duke of Sully oppo&s;ed all her de|&s;igns; &s;he knew the power which his wi&s;dom and integrity gave him over the mind of the king; but &s;uch was her confidence in her own charms, and in tho&s;e &s;chemes which her low cunning, and the intere&s;ted policy of her relations and depen|dants had &s;ugge&s;ted, that &s;he fondly flattered her|&s;elf
<PB N="85" REF="93">
neither rea&s;ons of &s;tate, nor motives of honour would have force enough to hinder her royal lover from gratifying her wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Henry, either becau&s;e he had not yet taken any re&s;olution again&s;t her, or, that his tenderne&s;s and regard for her hindered him from declaring it, &s;uf|fered her to remain in this plea&s;ing delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the mean time &s;he appeared in the &s;tate and equipage of a queen; the &s;ervile courtiers antici|pated her expected dignity by paying her tho&s;e honours which were due only to the wife of their prince. No language but that of adulation ever reached her ear; power, magnificence, plea&s;ure, offered her every day &s;ucce&s;&s;ive delights; her &s;mile was con&s;idered as the &s;mile of fortune; le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful guilt looked up to her with &s;ecret re|pinings; envy, dazzled by her blaze of grandeur, dur&s;t not even in whi&s;pers breathe its di&s;content; and only virtue beheld her at once with pity and contempt.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of all this &s;plendor madame de Beaufort was completely wretched; the fear of future di&s;appointments rendered her pre&s;ent enjoyments ta&s;tele&s;s; con&s;cious of the &s;lender chains by which &s;he held the king's heart, &s;he lived in perpetual anxiety, le&s;t her beauty &s;hould &s;uffer any decay; the &s;lighte&s;t alteration in her com|plexion filled her with dreadful alarms, and every evening brought with it the painful reflection that &s;he was now a day older than &s;he was ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>While the di&s;&s;olution of the king's marriage with Margaret of Valois was &s;oliciting at Rome,
<PB N="86" REF="94">
&s;he equally dreaded and wi&s;hed for the determi|nation of that important affair.</P>
<P>If the divorce was granted, the king would in|deed be at liberty to marry her, but he would be free likewi&s;e to marry any one el&s;e; and all the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of his &s;ubjects earne&s;tly de&s;ired to &s;ee him married to &s;ome prince&s;s of Europe, who might bring him heirs worthy to reign over them; and if among all tho&s;e prince&s;&s;es who were judged to be &s;uitable matches for Henry the IV. &s;he heard any of them prai&s;ed for their beauty, &s;he trembled and could not conceal her unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The king cau&s;ed the pictures of the Infanta of Spain, and of Mary de Medicis to be &s;hewn to her, being curious to know what &s;he would &s;ay.</P>
<P><Q>I am under no apprehen&s;ion of that brown woman, <HI>&s;aid &s;he, &s;peaking of the Infanta,</HI> but the Florentine fills me with dread.</Q></P>
<P>This painful anxiety, which was the con&s;equence of her precarious &s;ituation, received continual in|crea&s;e by the confidence &s;he placed in the predic|tions of a&s;trologers.</P>
<P><Q>Madame de Beaufort, &s;ays the Duke of Sully, was the weake&s;t of her &s;ex, with regard to divi|nation: &s;he did not pretend to deny that &s;he con&s;ulted a&s;trologers concerning her affairs; and indeed &s;he had always a great many of them about her, who never quitted her; and what is mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing, though &s;he doubtle&s;s paid them well, yet they never foretold her any thing but what was di&s;agreeable.</Q></P>
<P><Q>One &s;aid that &s;he would never be married but once, another that &s;he would die young, a third
<PB N="87" REF="95">
warned her to take care of being with child, and a fourth a&s;&s;ured her that &s;he would be betrayed by one of her friends. Hence proceeded that melancholy which oppre&s;s'd her, and which &s;he was never able to overcome.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Gracienne, one of her women, has &s;ince told me, that &s;he would often retire from company to pa&s;s whole nights in grief and weeping, on ac|count of the&s;e predictions.</Q></P>
<P>If we add to this continual anxiety the &s;tings of con&s;cience for unrepented guilt, can imagination form the idea of a more wretched being than this woman, in the mid&s;t of all her &s;plendor, power, and magnificence?</P>
<P>The trouble of de&s;pair, &s;ays a &s;en&s;ible writer, always ri&s;es in proportion to the evil that is feared; con&s;equently the greate&s;t agonies of expectation are tho&s;e which relate to another world.</P>
<P>The&s;e agonies, which &s;he who lived in an in|famous commerce with a married man often ex|perienced, were heightened by an event which af|fected her more than any other per&s;on, and &s;eemed a frightful pre&s;age of her own approaching fate.</P>
<P>She was far advanced in another guilty preg|nancy, when the &s;trange death of Loui&s;a de Budos, &s;econd wife to Henry Con&s;table de Montmorency, filled her with unu&s;ual horrors, and embittered all the &s;hort remainder of her life.</P>
<P><Q>The&s;e two deaths (&s;ays the Duke of Sully &s;peaking of the con&s;table's lady, and Madame de Beaufort) made a great noi&s;e every where, and were attended with a &s;urpri&s;ing &s;imilarity of very uncommon circum&s;tances: both were &s;eized

with a violent di&s;temper that la&s;ted only three or four days; and both, tho' extremely beautiful, became horribly disfigured, which together with &s;ome other circum&s;tances, that at any other time would have been thought natural, or only the effects of poi&s;on, rai&s;ed a report in the world, that the deaths of the&s;e two young ladies, as well as their elevation, was the work of the devil, who made them pay dearly for that &s;hort felicity he had procured them. And this was certainly believed not only among&s;t the common people, who are generally credulous to a high degree of folly, but among&s;t the courtiers them&s;elves.</Q></P>
<P>"This, pur&s;ues the duke of Sully, is what is re|lated of the con&s;table's lady, and as it is &s;aid by the ladies who were then at her hou&s;e: &s;he was con|ver&s;ing with them gaily in her clo&s;et, when one of her women entered in great terror, and told her that a certain per&s;on, who called him&s;elf a gentle|man, and who indeed had a good pre&s;ence, &s;ay|ing that he was quite black, and of a gigantic &s;ta|ture, had ju&s;t entered her antichamber, and de&s;ired to &s;peak to her about affairs of great con&s;equence, which he could communicate to none but her.</P>
<P>"At every circum&s;tance relating to this extraor|dinary courier, the lady was &s;een to grow pale; and appeared &s;o oppre&s;&s;ed with grief, that &s;he could &s;carcely bid her woman intreat the gentleman to de|fer his vi&s;it to another time; to which he replied in a tone that filled the me&s;&s;enger with horror, That &s;ince the lady would not come to him willingly he would take the trouble to go and &s;eek her in her clo&s;et. She, who was more afraid of a publick than
<PB N="89" REF="97">
a private audience, re&s;olved at la&s;t to go to him, but with all the marks of a deep de&s;pair.</P>
<P>"The terrible me&s;&s;age performed, &s;he returned to her company, bathed in tears, and half dead with di&s;may: &s;he had only time to &s;peak a few words to take leave of them, particularly of three ladies who were her intimate friends, and to a&s;&s;ure them that &s;he &s;hould never &s;ee them more.</P>
<P>"That in&s;tant &s;he was &s;eized with exqui&s;ite pains, and died at the end of three days, filling all who &s;aw her with horror at the frightful change of every feature in her once lovely face."</P>
<P>The dutche&s;s of Beaufort proved the truth of that ob&s;ervation, that repentance is often not &s;o much remor&s;e for our &s;ins, as fear of the con&s;e|quence&mdash;This fear indeed acted powerfully upon her mind; but it did not produce reformation in her conduct, which is the only infallible &s;ign by which true penitence may be known.</P>
<P>The king having re&s;olved to &s;pend the Ea&s;ter holidays at Fontainebleau, was unwilling to incur the cen&s;ure of keeping this lady with him during that &s;acred fe&s;tival. Madame de Beaufort, who had in&s;i&s;ted upon making one of the party with the king, was &s;en&s;ibly mortified when, after a &s;tay only of three or four days, he intreated her to leave him at Fontainebleau, and return her&s;elf to Paris.</P>
<P>This reque&s;t, enforced by motives drawn from the impropriety of their continuing together at &s;uch a time, was received with tears by the dutche&s;s. Whether it was that her pride was &s;en&s;ibly wounded by the king's &s;o ea&s;ily admitting the nece&s;&s;ity of her ab&s;ence, or that &s;he had really &s;ome &s;ecret forebod|ing
<PB N="90" REF="98">
that &s;he &s;hould never &s;ee him more, &s;he &s;eemed to con&s;ider this &s;eparation as the greate&s;t misfor|tune that could befal her.</P>
<P>The duke of Sully, as well as all the other hi&s;to|rians who have mentioned this parting of the king and his mi&s;tre&s;s, allow that there was &s;omething very extraordinary in the grief expre&s;&s;ed by the two lovers upon this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>When the moment came that madame de Beaufort was to leave Fontainbleau, &s;he appeared overwhelmed with angui&s;h. The king, who was more pa&s;&s;io|nately fond of her than ever, &s;truggled to repre&s;s his emotions: he conducted her half way to Paris; and although they propo&s;ed only an ab&s;ence of a few days, yet they dreaded the moment of &s;epara|tion, as if they were never to meet more.
<Q>Tho&s;e (&s;ays the duke of Sully) who are inclined to give faith to &s;uch kind of forebodings will lay &s;ome &s;tre&s;s upon this relation. The two lovers re|newed their endearments; and in every thing they &s;aid to each other at that moment, &s;ome per&s;ons have pretended to find proofs of the&s;e pre&s;ages of an inevitable fate.</Q></P>
<P>Henry &s;ighing led his mi&s;tre&s;s to the boat which was to carry her down to the ar&s;enal. Ju&s;t as &s;he was preparing to enter it, &s;he &s;topped, and turning to the king, who was oppre&s;&s;ed with grief, &s;he &s;poke to him, as if for the la&s;t time. She recom|mended to his care her children, her e&s;tate of Mon|ceaux, and her dome&s;tics. Henry li&s;tened to her; but, in&s;tead of comforting her, gave way to &s;ym|pathi&s;ing &s;orrow. Again they took leave of each other, and a &s;ecret emotion again drew them to each other's arms.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="99">The king, not being able to tear him&s;elf from her, the mar&s;hal D'Ornano, Roquelaure, and Fron|tenac, forced him away, and prevailed upon him at length to return to Fontainebleau, after he had tenderly recommended the care of his mi&s;tre&s;s to La Varenne, with orders to conduct her &s;afely to the hou&s;e of Zamet <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Seba&s;tian Zamet, a private gentlemen of immen&s;e for|tune. He was an Italian, and a native of Lucca, but got him&s;elf naturalized in 1581. He de&s;ired the notary who drew up his daughter's contract of marriage, to &s;tile him lord of &s;e|venteen hundred thou&s;and crowns. Henry IV. loved him for his wit and facetious humour, and cho&s;e his hou&s;e for col|lations and parties of plea&s;ure.</NOTE>, to whom he cho&s;e to con|fide this pledge &s;o dear to him.</P>
<P>The duke of Sully being at Paris when madame de Beaufort arrived there, he thought him&s;elf obliged to wait on her before he &s;et out for his e&s;tate at Ro&s;ny; and by the account he gives of her di&s;cour&s;e to him, it appears that her melan|choly ideas were already di&s;&s;ipated; and that &s;he again indulged her&s;elf in her gay dreams of roy|alty, and cheri&s;hed all her ambitious hopes: dreams &s;o &s;oon to be changed to a frightful certainty, and hopes &s;hortly to terminate in de&s;pair and death!</P>
<P><Q>She gave me (&s;ays the duke of Sully) a mo&s;t obliging reception, and &s;eemed to have wholly forgot our di&s;pute at Saint Germain; but not chu&s;ing to explain her&s;elf clearly upon that com|pliance with her projects to which &s;he wi&s;hed to bring me, &s;he contented her&s;elf with endeavour|ing to engage me in her intere&s;t, by mingling with tho&s;e civilities which &s;he &s;hewed to very few per&s;ons, words which carried a double &s;en&s;e, and hinted to me a boundle&s;s grandeur, if I would
<PB N="92" REF="100">
relax a little in the &s;everity of my coun&s;el to the king with regard to her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I (pur&s;ues the duke) who was as little moved with the chimeras that filled her head as with tho&s;e &s;he &s;ought to in&s;pire me with, pretended not to under&s;tand any part of a di&s;cour&s;e intel|ligible enough; and an&s;wered her equivocal terms with general profe&s;&s;ions of re&s;pect, at|tachment, and devotion, which &s;ignify what one will.</Q></P>
<P>The dutche&s;s of Sully going likewi&s;e to pay a vi&s;it to the triumphant mi&s;tre&s;s, was overwhelmed with the airs of royalty a&s;&s;umed by this poor crea|ture already devoted to the &s;hades of death, and &s;o &s;oon to an&s;wer at the tribunal of divine ju&s;tice for that guilty grandeur which &s;he prefered to eternal happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Madame de Beaufort kindly intreated the dutch|e&s;s of Sully to love her, and to conver&s;e with her as a friend.
<Q>Entered into confidances (&s;ays the duke of Sully) that would have appeared to be the la&s;t in&s;tances of the mo&s;t intimate friend&s;hip to tho&s;e, who, like madame de Sully, knew not that the dutche&s;s, who had no great &s;hare of under|&s;tanding, was not very delicate in the choice of her confidants. It was her highe&s;t plea&s;ure to entertain any per&s;on &s;he fir&s;t &s;aw with her &s;chemes and expectations; and when &s;he con|ver&s;ed with her inferiors, &s;he &s;carce &s;ubmitted to any caution; for with them &s;he no longer guarded her expre&s;&s;ions, but often a&s;&s;umed the &s;tate and language of a queen.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Madame de Sully (continues the duke) could not avoid &s;hewing &s;ome &s;urprize at the dutche&s;s's
<PB N="93" REF="101">
di&s;cour&s;e, e&s;pecially when that lady, making an ab&s;urd a&s;&s;emblage of the civilities practi&s;ed among per&s;ons of equal rank with the&s;e airs of a queen, told her &s;he might come to her <HI>coucher</HI> and <HI>lever</HI> when &s;he plea&s;ed, with many other &s;peeches of the &s;ame kind.</Q></P>
<P>It was in the mid&s;t of the&s;e intoxicating dreams of ambition, and while &s;he re&s;igned her whole &s;oul to &s;cenes of pre&s;ent plea&s;ure, and to hopes of future greatne&s;s, that Providence thought fit to put a pe|riod to her life.</P>
<P>She was &s;till at the hou&s;e of Seba&s;tian Zamet, who had received his fair gue&s;t with all the a&s;&s;idu|ity of a courtier &s;olicitous to plea&s;e, when on Maun|dy Thur&s;day, after a luxurious repa&s;t, &s;he had an inclination to hear the evening &s;ervice at Saint An|thony's the Le&s;s: &s;he was there &s;eized with faint|ing fits, which obliged her attendants to carry her back immediately.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he arrived at Zamet's, &s;he went into the garden, hoping to receive &s;ome benefit from the air; but in a few minutes &s;he was attacked with an apoplectic fit, which it was expected would have in&s;tantly &s;tifled her.</P>
<P>She recovered a little, through the a&s;&s;i&s;tance that was given her; and, &s;trongly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a notion that &s;he was poi&s;oned, &s;he commanded her &s;ervants to carry her from that hou&s;e to madame de Sourdis her aunt, who lived in the cloi&s;ter Saint Germain.</P>
<P>They had but ju&s;t time to put her in bed, when thick &s;ucceeding convul&s;ions, &s;o dreadful as amazed
<PB N="94" REF="102">
all who were pre&s;ent, and every &s;ymptom of ap|proaching death, left mon&s;ieur Varenne, who had taken up the pen to inform the king of this me|lancholy accident nothing el&s;e to &s;ay, but that the phy&s;icians de&s;paired of the dutche&s;s's life, from the nature of her di&s;temper, which required the mo&s;t violent remedies, and the circum&s;tance of her being big with child, which made all applications mortal.</P>
<P>Scarce had he &s;ent away the letter, when the dutche&s;s, drawing near her la&s;t moments, fell into new convul&s;ions, which disfigured her &s;o horribly, that Varenne, not doubting but that the king would upon the receipt of his letter &s;et out in&s;tantly to &s;ee his mi&s;tre&s;s, thought it more prudent to tell him in a &s;econd letter that &s;he was dead, than ex|po&s;e him to a &s;pectacle at once &s;o dreadful and af|flicting, as that of a woman whom he tenderly loved, expiring in agitations, &s;truggles, and agonies which &s;carcely left any thing of human in her figure.</P>
<P>On the Saturday following the convul&s;ions had turned her quite black, and writh'd her mouth to the back of her neck. Riviere, the king's fir&s;t phy&s;ician, coming in great ha&s;te upon this occa&s;ion with others of the king's phy&s;icians, but ju&s;t en|tered her chamber, and when he &s;aw the extraor|dinary condition &s;he was in went away, &s;aying to tho&s;e who were with him, <HI>This is the hand of God</HI></P>
<P>A few moments afterwards the dutche&s;s expired, in a general &s;ubver&s;ion of all the functions of nature, capable of in&s;piring horror and di&s;may.</P>
<P>The king who, upon the receipt of Varenne's fir&s;t letter, had not failed to mount his hor&s;e im|mediately, received the &s;econd when he was got
<PB N="95" REF="103">
half way to Paris; and li&s;tening to nothing but the exce&s;s of his pa&s;&s;ion, was re&s;olved, notwith&s;tanding all that could be &s;aid to him to give him&s;elf the con|&s;olation of &s;eeing his mi&s;tre&s;s once more.</P>
<P>Mar&s;hal Ba&s;&s;ompierre, in his Memoirs, relates that Henry did not believe his mi&s;tre&s;s was dead, and continued his journey; but that Varenne, having come to acquaint the mar&s;hal D'Ornano and him, who had accompanied the dutche&s;s to Paris, that &s;he was ju&s;t dead, they both took hor&s;e, to carry the melancholy news to the king, and hinder him from proceeding to Paris.</P>
<P>We found the king, &s;ays mar&s;hal Ba&s;&s;ompierre, on the other &s;ide of La Sau&s;&s;aye near Vilejuif, coming on po&s;t hor&s;es with the utmo&s;t expedition. As &s;oon as he perceived the mar&s;hal D'Ornano, he &s;u&s;pected that he was come to bring him fatal tidings, which as &s;oon as he had heard, he uttered the mo&s;t pa&s;|&s;ionate complaints.</P>
<P>The&s;e noblemen having with great difficulty prevailed upon Henry to go into the Abbey La Saui&s;&s;ay, they laid him upon a bed, till the coach which they had ordered to follow came from Paris: they put him into it, to carry him back to Fontaine|bleau, and during this little journey he was &s;o op|pre&s;s'd with grief that he fell into a fainting fit in the arms of the ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he arrived at Fontainebleau he di&s;|patched a me&s;&s;enger to the Duke of Sully, who was at his country-&s;eat, to de&s;ire he would come to him in&s;tantly.</P>
<P>It is worthy remark, that the king &s;hould upon this occa&s;ion of his mi&s;tre&s;s's death think no one
<PB N="96" REF="104">
&s;o capable of giving him con&s;olation as the man who had mo&s;t oppo&s;ed his extravagant fondne&s;s for her; &s;uch is the involuntary homage which even the pa&s;&s;ions them&s;elves pay to wi&s;dom and virtue!</P>
<P>When this me&s;&s;enger arrived at the duke's ca&s;tle, he was conver&s;ing with his wife upon the extraor|dinary airs a&s;&s;umed by the Dutche&s;s of Beaufort when &s;he la&s;t &s;aw her; and perceiving her to be &s;o much affected with the di&s;cour&s;e &s;he had held with her as to conclude there would certainly be &s;ome very great change in the fortune of this lady, the duke acquainted her with Madame de Beau|fort's de&s;ign to get her&s;elf declared queen, with the practices of her relations and dependants for that purpo&s;e, the &s;truggles the king had in his own mind, and the re&s;olution he had taken to overcome him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Madame de Sully was li&s;tening attentively to this relation, when they heard the bell of the fir&s;t gate of the ca&s;tle, without the moat, ring, and none of the &s;ervants an&s;wering, it being yet &s;carcely day, a voice &s;everal times repeated, <HI>I come from the king</HI></P>
<P>The Duke of Sully that in&s;tant wakening one of the grooms of his chamber, &s;ent him to open the gate; and in his impatience to know the cau&s;e of this early &s;ummons, he &s;lipt on a night-gown and ran to meet the courier, when ob&s;erving a deep con|cern upon his countenance, he a&s;ked him trembling, if the king was ill?</P>
<P>No, replied the man, but he is in the utmo&s;t affliction, madame the dutche&s;s is dead.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="105">
<Q>This news, &s;ays the Duke of Sully, appear|ed to me &s;o improbable, that I made him repeat his words &s;everal times; and when convinced that it was true, I felt my mind divided between grief for the condition to which her death re|duced the king, and joy for the advantages all France would derive from it, which was increa&s;|ed, by my being fully per&s;uaded that the king would by this tran&s;itory affliction purcha&s;e a re|lea&s;e from a thou&s;and anxieties, and much more angui&s;h of heart than what he now actually &s;uf|fered. I went up again to my wife's chamber full of the&s;e reflections,
<Q>You will neither go to the dutche&s;s's <HI>Coucher</HI> nor <HI>Lever,</HI> &s;aid I, for &s;he is dead.</Q></Q></P>
<P>So &s;udden and &s;o fatal a fall from all tho&s;e towering hopes of grandeur filled Madame de Sully with a&s;toni&s;hment and concern for the unhappy dutche&s;s of Beaufort. The &s;hocking particulars of her &s;trange death &s;he was made acquainted with by a letter from La Varenne to her lord.</P>
<P>The Duke of Sully ha&s;tened to the king, whom he found walking in a gallery, &s;o oppre&s;s'd with grief that all company was in&s;upportable to him. This wi&s;e coun&s;ellor and faithful friend employed every argument drawn from religion, virtue, and policy, to mitigate his &s;orrow: he even ventured to repre|&s;ent to him that the event which now cau&s;ed him all this affliction was among the number of tho&s;e which he would one day look upon as mo&s;t for|tunate: he conjured him to con&s;ider the painful &s;ituation he would have been in, if his mi&s;tre&s;s had lived; when on one &s;ide, &s;truggling with the force
<PB N="98" REF="106">
of a tender and violent pa&s;&s;ion, and on the other with the &s;ilent convictions of what honour and duty required of him, he would have been under an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of coming to &s;ome re&s;olution with re&s;pect to an engagement which he could not break without torture, nor continue without in|famy.</P>
<P>Heaven, he told him, came to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance by a &s;troke painful indeed; but the only one that could open the way to a marriage upon which depended the tranquillity of France, the fate of Europe, the welfare of his &s;ubjects, and his own happine&s;s.</P>
<P><Q>Henry, adds the Duke of Sully, had not the weakne&s;s of re&s;igning him&s;elf up to grief through ob&s;tinacy; or of &s;eeking a cure in in&s;en&s;ibility. He li&s;tened more to the dictates of his rea&s;on than his pa&s;&s;ion, and appeared already much le&s;s afflicted to the courtiers who entered his cham|ber. At length, every one being careful not to renew his grief, which his daily employments gradually dimini&s;hed, he found him&s;elf in that &s;tate which all wi&s;e men ought to be, who have had great &s;ubjects of affliction; that is, nei|ther condemning nor flattering the cau&s;e, nor affecting either to recal or bani&s;h the remem|brance of it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le Grain tells us, that the king made all his court go into mourning for the Dutche&s;s of Beaufort; he him&s;elf was dre&s;&s;ed in black the fir&s;t eight days, and afterwards in violet.</NOTE>.</Q></P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF HARRIOT AND SOPHIA CONTINUED.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Herbert having recovered from the a&s;toni&s;hment into which he had been thrown by the &s;trange behaviour of Mi&s;s Darnley, endeavoured to comfort her mother, who&s;e weak mind was more di&s;po&s;ed to be alarmed at the threat &s;he had uttered upon her quitting the room, than to re&s;ent &s;uch an in&s;ult to parental tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>After gently in&s;inuating to her, that &s;he ought to reduce her elde&s;t daughter to rea&s;on, by a proper exertion of her authority, he earne&s;tly recommended to her to be particularly attentive to an affair which concerned the happine&s;s of her younge&s;t child, from who&s;e piety and good &s;en&s;e &s;he might promi&s;e her|&s;elf &s;o much comfort.</P>
<P>He advi&s;ed her to give Sir Charles Stanley an opportunity of explaining him&s;elf to her as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; and to make him comprehend, that he mu&s;t not hope for permi&s;&s;ion to pay his addre&s;&s;es to Sophia, till he had &s;atisfied her that his intentions were &s;uch, as &s;he ought to approve.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="108">Mrs. Darnley appeared &s;o docile and complai&s;ant upon this occa&s;ion, &s;o ready to take advice, and &s;o fully determined to be directed by it, that Mr. Herbert went away extremely well &s;atisfied with her behaviour, and full of plea&s;ing hopes for his beloved Sophia.</P>
<P>Harriot, in the mean time, was tormenting her &s;i&s;ter above &s;tairs: &s;he had entered her room with a heart full of bitterne&s;s, and a countenance in|flamed with rage, flinging the door after her with &s;uch violence, that Sophia letting fall her book, &s;tarted up in great terror, and in a trembling accent a&s;ked her what was the matter with her?</P>
<P>Her own apprehen&s;ions had indeed already &s;ug|ge&s;ted to her the cau&s;e of the di&s;order &s;he appeared to be in, which it was not ea&s;y to di&s;cover in that tor|rent of reproach and invective with which &s;he &s;trove to overwhelm her. Scornful and unju&s;t reflections upon her per&s;on, bitter je&s;ts upon her pedantick af|fectation, and malignant in&s;inuations of hypocri&s;y, were all thrown out with the utmo&s;t incoherence of pa&s;&s;ion; to which Sophia an&s;wered no otherwi&s;e than by a provoking &s;erenity of countenance and calm attention.</P>
<P>That &s;he was able to bear with &s;o much mode|ration the cruel in&s;ults of her &s;i&s;ter, was not more the effect of her natural &s;weetne&s;s of temper, than her good &s;en&s;e and delicate turn of mind. The upper region of the air, &s;ays a &s;en&s;ible French wri|ter, admits neither clouds nor tempe&s;ts; the thun|der, &s;torms, and meteors, are formed below: &s;uch is the difference between a mean, and an exalted under&s;tanding.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="109">Harriot, who did not find her account in this behaviour, &s;ought to rou&s;e her to rage by re|proaches &s;till more &s;evere, till having ineffectually railed her&s;elf out of breath, &s;he aukwardly imitated her &s;i&s;ter's compo&s;ure, folded her hands before her, and &s;eating her&s;elf, a&s;ked her in a low but &s;olemn tone of voice, whether &s;he would deign to an&s;wer her one plain que&s;tion?</P>
<P>Sophia then re&s;uming her &s;eat, told her with a look of mingled dignity and &s;weetne&s;s, that &s;he was ready to an&s;wer her any que&s;tion, and give her any &s;atisfaction &s;he could de&s;ire, provided &s;he would repre&s;s tho&s;e indecent tran&s;ports of anger, &s;o unbe|coming her &s;ex and years.</P>
<P>Why, you little envious creature, &s;aid Harriot, you do not &s;urely, becau&s;e you are two or three years younger than I am, pretend to in&s;inuate that I am old?</P>
<P>No certainly, replied Sophia, half &s;miling, my meaning is, that you are too young to adopt, as you do, all the peevi&s;hne&s;s of old age; but your que&s;tion &s;i&s;ter, pur&s;ued &s;he&mdash;</P>
<P>Well then, &s;aid Harriot, I a&s;k you, how you have dared to &s;ay that Sir Charles Stanley was tired of me, and preferred you to me?</P>
<P>Tired of you! repeated Sophia, &s;hocked at her coar&s;ene&s;s and fal&s;hood, I never was capable of making u&s;e of &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion, nor do I famili|ari&s;e my&s;elf with ideas that need &s;uch &s;trange lan|guage to convey them.</P>
<P>Harriot provoked almo&s;t to frenzy by this hint, which her indi&s;creet conduct made but too ju&s;t, &s;hew down &s;tairs to her mother, and with mingled &s;obs and

exclamations, told her, that Sophia had treated her like an infamous creature, who had di&s;honoured her&s;elf and her family.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley, though more favourably di&s;po&s;ed towards her younge&s;t daughter, &s;ince &s;he had been made acquainted with the baronet's affection for her, yet was on this occa&s;ion governed by her ha|bitual preference of Harriot; and &s;ending for So|phia, &s;he reproved her with great a&s;perity for her in&s;olent behaviour to her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Sophia li&s;tened with reverence to her mother's reproofs; and after ju&s;tifying her&s;elf, as &s;he ea&s;ily might, from the accu&s;ation her &s;i&s;ter had brought again&s;t her, &s;he added, that not being willing to be expo&s;ed to any farther per&s;ecutions on account of Sir Charles Stanley, who&s;e &s;incerity &s;he thought very doubtful, &s;he was re&s;olved not to wait any longer for a place &s;uch as Mr. Herbert's tender|ne&s;s was in &s;earch of for her, but to accept the fir&s;t reputable one that offered.</P>
<P><Q>I have not the vanity, madam, pur&s;ued &s;he, to imagine that a man of rank and fortune can &s;eriou&s;ly re&s;olve to marry an indigent young woman like me; and although I am humble enough to go to &s;ervice, I am too proud to li&s;ten to the addre&s;&s;es of any man who, from his &s;u|periority of fortune, thinks he has a right to keep me in doubt of his intentions, or, in a mean dependance upon a re&s;olution which he has not perhaps regard enough for me to make.</Q></P>
<P>This di&s;cour&s;e was not at all reli&s;hed by Mrs. Darnley, who conceived that many inconveniences were to be &s;ubmitted to, for the enjoyment of af|fluence
<PB N="103" REF="111">
and plea&s;ure; but Sophia, who had revolv|ed in her mind all the mortifications a young wo|man is expo&s;ed to, who&s;e poverty places her &s;o great|ly below her lover; that &s;he is to con&s;ider his pro|fe&s;&s;ions as an honour, and to be rejoiced at every indication of his &s;incerity; her delicacy was &s;o much wounded by the bare apprehen&s;ion of &s;uffer|ing what &s;he thought an indignity to her &s;ex, that &s;he was determined to give Sir Charles Stanley no encouragement, but to pur&s;ue her fir&s;t de&s;ign of &s;eeking a decent e&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;uitable to the depre&s;s'd &s;tate of her fortune.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley, however, combatted her re&s;olution with arguments which &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed ab&s;olutely con|clu&s;ive, and added to them her commands not to think any more of &s;o humiliating a de&s;ign, which &s;o offended Harriot, that &s;he broke out again into tears, exclamations, and reproaches.</P>
<P>Her mother would have found it a difficult ta&s;k to have pacified her, had not a me&s;&s;age from a lady, inviting her to a concert that evening, obliged her to calm her mind, that her complexion might not &s;uffer from tho&s;e emotions of rage which &s;he had hitherto taken &s;o little pains to repre&s;s.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Harriot retired, to begin the labours of the toilet, Mrs. Darnley, with great mildne&s;s, re|pre&s;ented to Sophia, that it was her duty to im|prove the affection Sir Charles expre&s;s'd for her, &s;ince by that means it might be in her power to make her mother and her &s;i&s;ter ea&s;y in their cir|cum&s;tances, and engage their love for ever.</P>
<P>This was attacking Sophia on her weak &s;ide; &s;he an&s;wered with the &s;ofte&s;t tenderne&s;s of look

and accent,
<Q>That it was her highe&s;t ambition to make them happy.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Then I do not doubt, my child, &s;aid Mrs. Darnley, but you will employ all your good &s;en&s;e to &s;ecure the conque&s;t you have made.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia, melted almo&s;t to tears by the&s;e tender expre&s;&s;ions, to which &s;he had been &s;o little u&s;ed, a&s;&s;ured her mother &s;he would upon this occa&s;ion act &s;o as to de&s;erve her kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley would have been better plea&s;ed if &s;he had been le&s;s re&s;erved, and had appeared more affected with the fine pro&s;pect that was open|ing for her; but it was not po&s;&s;ible to pre&s;s her far|ther. Nature here had transferred the parent's rights to the child, and the gay, imprudent ambi|tious mother, &s;tood awed and aba&s;hed, in he pre|&s;ence of her worthier daughter.</P>
<P>Sophia, who expected Sir Charles would renew his vi&s;it in the evening, pa&s;t the re&s;t of the day in unea&s;y perturbations. He entered the hou&s;e ju&s;t at the time that Harriot, who had ordered a chair to be got for her, came fluttering down the &s;tairs in full dre&s;s. As &s;oon as &s;he perceived him her cheeks glowed with re&s;entment; but affecting a carele&s;s inattention, &s;he &s;hot by him with a half courte&s;y, and made towards the door: he followed, and acco&s;ting her with a grave but re&s;pectful air, de&s;ired &s;he would permit him to lead her to her chair. Harriot, conveying all the &s;corn into her face which the expre&s;&s;ion of her pretty but unmeaning fea|tures were capable of, and rudely drawing away her hand,
<Q>Pray, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, carry your <HI>devores</HI> where
<PB N="105" REF="115">
they will be more acceptable; I am not di&s;po&s;ed to be je&s;ted with any longer.</Q></P>
<P>Sir Charles, half &s;miling and bowing low, told her, that he re&s;pected her too much, as well upon her own account as upon Mi&s;s Sophia's, for whom indeed he had the mo&s;t tender regard, to be guilty of the impertinence &s;he accu&s;ed him of.</P>
<P>Harriot did not &s;tay to hear more: offended in the highe&s;t degree at the manner in which he mentioned Sophia, &s;he darted an angry look at him, and flung her&s;elf into her chair.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that Sir Charles di&s;covered upon this occa&s;ion a great &s;hare of that ea&s;y confi|dence which people are apt to derive from &s;plen|did fortunes and undi&s;puted rank; but as he wanted neither good &s;en&s;e, genero&s;ity, nor even delicacy, he would have found it difficult to own to a lady whom he had been u&s;ed to addre&s;s in the &s;tyle of a lover, that his heart had received a new impre&s;&s;ion, if the contemptible character of Harriot had not authori&s;ed his de&s;ertion of her. Pride, ignorance, folly, and affectation, &s;ink a woman &s;o low in the eyes of men, that they ea&s;ily di&s;pen&s;e with them|&s;elves from a &s;trict ob&s;ervance of tho&s;e delicate at|tentions, and re&s;pectful regards, which the &s;ex in ge|neral claim by the laws of politene&s;s, but which &s;en&s;e and di&s;cernment never pay to the trifling part of it.</P>
<P>Sir Charles was likewi&s;e glad of an opportunity to &s;hew Mi&s;s Darnley, that he did not think the little gallantry which had pa&s;&s;ed between them, entitled her to make him any reproaches; or to con&s;ider the pa&s;&s;ion he profe&s;&s;ed for her &s;i&s;ter as an
<PB N="106" REF="116">
infidelity to her; and now finding him&s;elf more at ea&s;e from the frank acknowledgment he had made, he &s;ent up his name, and was received by Mrs. Darnley with all the officious civility &s;he was u&s;ed to &s;hew him.</P>
<P>Sophia was in the room, and ro&s;e up at his en|trance in a &s;weet confu&s;ion, which &s;he endeavoured to conceal, by appearing extremely bu&s;y at a piece of needle-work.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, after &s;ome trifling conver&s;ation with her mother, approached her, and complimented her with an ea&s;y air upon her being &s;o u&s;efully employed, when mo&s;t other young ladies were a|broad in &s;earch of amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>Sophia, who was now a little recovered, an&s;wered him with that wit and vivacity which was &s;o na|tural to her; but looking up at the &s;ame time, &s;he &s;aw his eyes fixed upon her with a look &s;o tender and pa&s;&s;ionate, as threw her back into all her for|mer confu&s;ion, which encrea&s;ed every moment by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that it was plain to his ob&s;er|vation.</P>
<P>The young baronet, though he was charmed with her amiable mode&s;ty, yet endeavoured to re|lieve the concern he &s;aw her under, by talking of indifferent matters, till Mrs. Darnley &s;eeing them engaged in di&s;cour&s;e, prudently withdrew, when he in&s;tantly addre&s;&s;ed her in language more tender and particular.</P>
<P>Sophia, &s;hocked at her mother's indi&s;cretion, and at his taking advantage of it &s;o abruptly, let all the weight of her re&s;entment fall on him; and the poor lover was &s;o awed at her frowns, and the
<PB N="107" REF="117">
&s;arca&s;tic raillery which &s;he mingled with expre&s;|&s;ions that &s;hewed the mo&s;t invincible indifference, that not daring to continue a di&s;cour&s;e which of|fended her, and in too great concern to introduce another &s;ubject, he &s;tood fixed in &s;ilence for &s;everal minutes, leaning on the back of her chair, while &s;he plied her needle with the mo&s;t earne&s;t at|tention, and felt her confu&s;ion decrea&s;e in propor|tion as his became more apparent.</P>
<P>At length he walked &s;lowly to the other end of the room, and taking up a new book which he had &s;ent her a few days before, he a&s;ked her opinion of it in a faultering accent; and was extremely mor|tified to find &s;he was &s;o much at ea&s;e, as to an&s;wer him, with all the readine&s;s of wit and clearne&s;s of judgment imaginable.</P>
<P>Another pau&s;e of &s;ilence en&s;ued, during which Sophia heard him &s;igh &s;oftly &s;everal times, while he turned over the leaves of the book with &s;uch rapidity as &s;hewed he &s;carce read a &s;ingle line in any page of it.</P>
<P>He was thus employed when Mrs. Darnley re|turned, who &s;tood &s;taring fir&s;t at one, then at the other, &s;trangely perplexed at their looks and &s;ilence, and apprehen&s;ive that all was not right. Sophia now took an opportunity to retire, and met an angry glance from her mother as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed by her.</P>
<P>Her departure rou&s;ed Sir Charles out of his re|very, he looked after her, and then turning to Mrs. Darnley, overcame his di&s;content &s;o far as to be able to entertain her a quarter of an hour with his u&s;ual politene&s;s; and finding Sophia did not ap|pear again, he took his leave.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="118">As &s;oon as he was gone Mrs. Darnley called her daughter, and chid her &s;everely for her rudene&s;s in leaving the baronet.</P>
<P>Sophia defended her&s;elf as well as &s;he could, without owning the true cau&s;e of her di&s;gu&s;t, which was her mother's &s;o officiou&s;ly quitting the room; but Mrs. Darnley was &s;o ill &s;atisfied with her be|haviour, that &s;he complained of it to her friend Mr. Herbert, who came in &s;oon afterwards, telling him that Sophia's pride and ill temper would be the ruin of her fortune.</P>
<P>The good man having heard the &s;tory but one way, thought Sophia a little to blame, till having an opportunity to di&s;cour&s;e with her freely, he found the fault &s;he had been charged with, was no more than an exce&s;s of delicacy, which was very pardon|able in her &s;ituation: he warned her, however, not to admit too readily apprehen&s;ions injurious to her&s;elf, which was in &s;ome degree deba&s;ing the dignity of her &s;ex and character; but to make the baronet comprehend that e&s;teeming him as a man of honour, &s;he con&s;idered his profe&s;&s;ions of regard to her as a claim upon her gratitude; and that, in con&s;equence, &s;he &s;hould without any reluctance receive the com|mands of her mother, and the advice of her friends in his favour.</P>
<P>Poor Sophia found her&s;elf but too well di&s;po&s;ed to think favourably of Sir Charles; her tenderne&s;s had &s;uffered greatly by the force &s;he had put upon her&s;elf to behave to him in &s;o di&s;obliging a manner, and the unea&s;ine&s;s &s;he &s;aw him under, his &s;ilence, and confu&s;ion, and the &s;ighs that e&s;caped him, ap|parently without de&s;ign, had affected her &s;en&s;ibly,
<PB N="109" REF="119">
and &s;everal days pa&s;&s;ing away without his appearing again, &s;he concluded he was irrecoverably preju|diced again&s;t her; the unea&s;ine&s;s this thought gave her, fir&s;t hinted to her&s;elf the impre&s;&s;ion he had already made on her heart.</P>
<P>Sir Charles indeed had been &s;o much piqued by her behaviour as to form the re&s;olution of &s;eeing her no more; but when he &s;uppo&s;ed him&s;elf mo&s;t capable of per&s;i&s;ting in this re&s;olution, he was near|e&s;t breaking through it, and &s;uddenly yielding to the impul&s;e of his tenderne&s;s, he flew to her again more pa&s;&s;ionate than ever; this little ab&s;ence hav|ing only &s;erved to &s;hew him how nece&s;&s;ary &s;he was to his happine&s;s.</P>
<P>When Sophia &s;aw him enter the room, the agi|tations of her mind might be ea&s;ily read in her artle&s;s countenance; a &s;entiment of joy for his re|turn gave new fire to her eyes, and vivacity to her whole per&s;on; while a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the effect his pre&s;ence produced, and a painful doubt of his &s;incerity, and the rectitude of his intentions, alter|nately dyed her cheeks with blu&s;hes and palene&s;s.</P>
<P>The young baronet approached her trembling, but the unexpected &s;oftne&s;s with which &s;he received him, increa&s;ing at once his pa&s;&s;ion and his hopes, he poured out his whole &s;oul in the tendere&s;t and mo&s;t ardent profe&s;&s;ions of love, e&s;teem, and ad|miration of her.</P>
<P>Sophia li&s;tened to him with a complai&s;ant atten|tion; and having had &s;ufficient time, while he was &s;peaking, to compo&s;e and recollect her&s;elf; &s;he told him, in a mode&s;t but firm accent, that &s;he was ob|liged to him for the favourable opinion he enter|tained
<PB N="110" REF="120">
of her; but that &s;he did not think her&s;elf at liberty to hear, much le&s;s to an&s;wer to &s;uch di&s;cour&s;e as he had thought proper to addre&s;s to her, till &s;he had the &s;anction of her mother's con&s;ent, and Mr. Her|bert's approbation, who&s;e truly parental regard for her, made her look upon him as another father, who &s;upplied the place of him &s;he had lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, more charmed with her than ever, was ready in his pre&s;ent flow of tender &s;entiments for her, to offer her his hand with an unre&s;erved|ne&s;s that would have &s;atisfied all her delicate &s;cru|ples; but carried away by the force of habit, an in&s;urmountable aver&s;ion to marriage, and the fal&s;e but &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed notion of refinements in a union of hearts, where love was the only tye, he could not re&s;olve to give her a proof of his affection, which in his opinion was the likelie&s;t way to de&s;troy all the ardor of it; but careful not to alarm her, and apprehending no great &s;everity of morals from the gay intere&s;ted mother, he politely thanked her for the liberty &s;he gave him to make his pa&s;&s;ion known to Mrs. Darnley, and to &s;olicit her con&s;ent to his happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Sophia ob&s;erved with &s;ome concern, that he af|fected to take no notice of Mr. Herbert upon this occa&s;ion; but &s;he would not allow her&s;elf to dwell long upon a thought &s;o capable of rai&s;ing doubts injurious to his honour; and &s;atisfied with the frank|ne&s;s of his proceeding thus far, &s;he &s;uffered no marks of di&s;content or apprehen&s;ion to appear in her countenance and behaviour.</P>
<P>Sir Charles did not fail to make &s;uch a general declaration of his &s;entiments to Mrs. Darnley as he
<PB N="111" REF="121">
thought &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy Sophia, without ob|liging him&s;elf to be more explicite; and in the mean time, having acquired a thorough knowledge of Mrs. Darnley's character, he &s;ought to engage her in his intere&s;t by a boundle&s;s liberality, and by gratifying all tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which make corruption ea&s;y. She loved di&s;&s;ipation; and all the plea&s;ures and amu&s;ements that inven|tive luxury had found out to vary the &s;hort &s;cene of life were at her command; &s;he had a high ta&s;te for the plea&s;ures of the table, and therefore the mo&s;t expen&s;ive wines, and choice&s;t delicacies that earth, &s;ea, and air could afford, were con&s;tantly &s;upplied by him in the greate&s;t profu&s;ion. No day ever pa&s;&s;ed without her receiving &s;ome con|&s;iderable pre&s;ent, the value of which was inhanced by the delicacy with which it was made.</P>
<P>The innocent Sophia con&s;trued all this munifi|cence into proofs of the &s;incerity of his affection for her; for the young baronet, whether awed by the dignity of her virtue, or that he judged it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;s of his de&s;igns, min|gled with the ardor of his profe&s;&s;ions, a behaviour &s;o re&s;pectful and delicate, as removed all her ap|prehen&s;ions, and left her whole &s;oul free to all the tender impre&s;&s;ions a lively gratitude could make on it.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, however, ea&s;ily penetrated into Sir Charles's views; he &s;aw with pain the progre&s;s he made every day in the affection of Sophia; but by the &s;peciou&s;ne&s;s of his conduct, he had e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf &s;o firmly in her good opinion, that he judged any attempt to alarm her fears, while there &s;eemed
<PB N="112" REF="122">
&s;o little foundation for them, would mi&s;s its effect; and not doubting but ere it was long her own ob&s;ervation would furni&s;h her with &s;ome cau&s;e for apprehen&s;ion, he contented him&s;elf for the pre&s;ent with keeping a vigilant eye upon the conduct of Sir Charles and Mrs. Darnley, and with being ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t Sophia in her perplexities, whenever &s;he had recour&s;e to him.</P>
<P>The change there was now in the &s;ituation of this amiable girl, afforded him many opportunities of admiring the excellence of her character: &s;he who formerly u&s;ed to be treated with neglect and even har&s;hne&s;s by her mother, was now di&s;tingui&s;hed with peculiar regard; her opinion always &s;ubmitted to with deference, her inclinations con&s;ulted in all things, and a &s;tudious endeavour to plea&s;e her was to be &s;een in every word and action of Mrs. Darnley's, who affected to be as partially fond of her as &s;he had once been of her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Even the haughty in&s;olent Harriot, keeping her rage and envy concealed in her own brea&s;t, con|de&s;cended to wear the appearance of kindne&s;s to her, while &s;he &s;hared with her mother in all tho&s;e gra|tifications which the lavi&s;h genero&s;ity of Sir Charles procured them, and which Sophia, &s;till continuing her u&s;ual &s;implicity of life, could never be per|&s;uaded to partake of. Yet all this produced no alteration in Sophia; the &s;ame mode&s;ty and humi|lity, the &s;ame &s;weetne&s;s of temper, and attention to oblige, di&s;tingui&s;hed her now as in her days of oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="123">Mr. Herbert contemplated her with admiration and delight, and often with a&s;toni&s;hment reflected upon the infatuation of Sir Charles, who could allow him&s;elf to be &s;o far governed by fa&s;hionable prejudices, and a libertine turn of mind, as to ba|lance one moment whether he &s;hould give him&s;elf a lawful claim to the affections of &s;uch a woman.</P>
<P>Affairs continued in this &s;tate during three months, when the good old man, who watched over his young favourite with all the pious &s;olici|tude of her guardian angel, perceived that &s;he was grown more melancholy and re&s;erved than u&s;ual; he often heard her &s;igh, and fancied &s;he had been weeping, and her fine eyes would appear &s;ome|times &s;uffu&s;ed with tears, even when &s;he endeavour|ed to appear mo&s;t chearful.</P>
<P>He imagined that &s;he had &s;omething upon her mind which &s;he wi&s;hed to di&s;clo&s;e to him; her looks &s;eemed to intimate as much, and &s;he frequently &s;ought opportunities of being alone with him, and engaged him to pa&s;s tho&s;e evenings with her when her mother and &s;i&s;ter were at any of the public entertainments. Yet all tho&s;e times, though her heart &s;eemed labouring with &s;ome &s;ecret unea&s;ine&s;s which &s;he would fain impart to him, &s;he had not re|&s;olution enough to enter into any explanation.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, who could have wi&s;hed &s;he had been more communicative, re&s;olved at length to &s;pare her any farther &s;truggles with her&s;elf; and one day when he was alone with her, taking occa|&s;ion to ob&s;erve that &s;he was not &s;o chearful as u&s;ual, he a&s;ked her tenderly if any thing had happened to give her unea&s;ine&s;s; &s;peak freely my child, &s;aid

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE VESTAL VIRGINS.</HEAD>
<P>NUMA Pompilius, the &s;econd king of Rome, a man of great virtue, piety, and wi&s;dom, is con&s;idered as author of the ve&s;tal in&s;titution; though there were ve&s;tals before his time, and even &s;o early as the &s;ettlement of Eneas in Italy, who, we are told, placed the palladium, an image of Pallas &s;o called, which he had brought with him from Troy, in the temple of Ve&s;ta, and committed it to the care of the virgins dedicated to the &s;ervice of that godde&s;s, who from her name were called ve&s;tals. But it was Numa who gave a form to this in&s;titution, and regulated the mini&s;try and of|fice of the order.</P>
<P>That prince confined the number of the ve&s;tals to four; two more were afterwards added by Tar|quinius Pri&s;cus, one of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and that number continued unaltered.</P>
<P>Numa committed to the&s;e virgins the keeping of the immortal fire, and the palladium, with the care of certain &s;ecret &s;acrifices in the wor&s;hip of the
<PB N="116" REF="126">
godde&s;s Ve&s;ta. They vowed cha&s;tity during the &s;pace of thirty years that they attended on the &s;ervice of the godde&s;s; the age of admi&s;&s;ion was above &s;ix, and under ten, and they were to be with|out any corporal blemi&s;h.</P>
<P>The ten fir&s;t years were a kind of noviciate or probation, when they were in&s;tructed in all the &s;a|cred my&s;teries; the next ten were pa&s;&s;ed in the practice of them, and the la&s;t ten in teaching the novices.</P>
<P>This term being expired, they were free to quit the order, to lay a&s;ide the di&s;tinctions of it and to marry; but very few, it is &s;aid, made u&s;e of this liberty, terrified with frequent examples of the unhappy end attending tho&s;e who changed their conditition.</P>
<P>Very great privileges and marks of di&s;tinction were at &s;everal times granted to the ve&s;tals. They had a right to make a will during their father's life, and to di&s;po&s;e of their fortunes, without a tru&s;tee; for the Roman women were always under guardian&s;hip: they were forbid to take an oath, and in courts of ju&s;tice their evidence was admit|ted upon their bare affirmation.</P>
<P>When they appeared in public, a lictor attended them with the fa&s;ces; and if a ve&s;tal in her walks happened to meet a criminal leading to execution, he was pardoned upon her declaring that the meet|ing was accidental. They had a di&s;tingui&s;hed rank and place of honour a&s;&s;igned them in the cir|cus, and at other public &s;hews, and were educated and maintained at the expence of the common|wealth.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="127">But if great honours were paid to the dignity and virtue of the ve&s;tals, their faults were al&s;o puni&s;hed with equel &s;everity. The faults thus puni&s;hable were either negligence of their duty, in &s;uffering the &s;acred fire to go out, or incontinence in violating their vow of cha&s;tity.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, which was looked upon as the &s;ign of &s;ome great calamity to the &s;tate, the guilty ve&s;tal was puni&s;hed as a &s;lave, that is, with &s;courg|ing; covered only with a veil, &s;he was whipped with rods by the Pontifex Maximus, or chief prie&s;t. One of the ve&s;tals &s;pent the whole night by the &s;acred fire, to prevent its extinction, and watched thus each in turn. When the fire was out, it was to be rekindled by the rays of the &s;un, the manner of which is variou&s;ly related.</P>
<P>The great crime of the ve&s;tals was the violation of their vow of cha&s;tity; and this was puni&s;hed in a manner not to be de&s;cribed without horror. They were buried alive. Near the Colline gate, &s;ays Plutarch, there is a little vault, with a hole to go down to it; in the vault there is a bed, a lighted lamp, and a &s;mall quantity of provi&s;ions, con&s;i&s;ting of a loaf, a pitcher of water, a vial of oil, and a pot of milk: the&s;e are provided for the criminal, that religion may not be wounded by &s;tarving to death a per&s;on con&s;ecrated with the mo&s;t augu&s;t and &s;a|cred ceremonies. Strange &s;cruple! they feared to &s;tarve her whom they buried alive.</P>
<P>The offender was put into a clo&s;e and covered lit|ter, that her piercing &s;hrieks might not be heard, and carried in that manner through crouds of people cro&s;s the forum. At the &s;ight of the litter, all made
<PB N="118" REF="128">
way for it to pa&s;s, and followed it in awful &s;ilence, and all the marks of the deepe&s;t &s;orrow. There could not be a more horrible &s;pectacle, nor a more dreadful or melancholy day for Rome, than that on which a ve&s;tal was carried to execution.</P>
<P>When the litter was come to the place of puni&s;h|ment, the lictors took off the covering and opened it; then the pontifex maximus, after &s;ome private prayers, with hands and eyes lifted up to heaven, took out the unhappy criminal, all clo&s;ely veiled, and &s;et her on the ladder, by which &s;he was to de|&s;cend into the vault: after which, he returned with the other prie&s;ts; and the wretched ve&s;tal was no &s;ooner down, but the ladder was removed, and the hole filled up with earth till the ground was even, and no &s;ign of a grave remained, to intimate that the criminal was deemed unworthy to appear either among the dead or the living.</P>
<P>By this terrible execution is &s;een what notions the heathens them&s;elves entertained concerning the breach of cha&s;tity; and their fear of its drawing down the cur&s;e and vengeance of the Gods upon the whole &s;tate, if it remained unpuni&s;hed. To avoid &s;uch a fatal calamity, the ve&s;tals were exhort|ed not only to fly with horror from every tempta|tion to guilt, but to avoid with the utmo&s;t care whatever could ca&s;t the lea&s;t blemi&s;h on their re|putation.</P>
<P>Po&s;thumia, a ve&s;tal, having &s;ubjected her&s;elf to unfavourable &s;u&s;picions, on account of her too great &s;olicitude in dre&s;s, and gaiety of manners, unbe|coming the &s;acred purity of a virgin, was called to her trial. After a long examination &s;he was pro|nounced
<PB N="119" REF="129">
innocent; but the pontifex maximus commanded her to quit tho&s;e gay airs for the future, and to &s;hew in her dre&s;s more wi&s;dom and mode&s;ty than elegance and ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The 638th year of Rome gives us an example of corruption among the ve&s;tals, never heard of be|fore. In preceding times it rarely happened that a ve&s;tal violated her vow of cha&s;tity, and the day of her puni&s;hment was a day of univer&s;al mourning at Rome. But this year, of the &s;ix ve&s;tals, three were proved criminal, two of which lo&s;ing all &s;en&s;e of fear as well as &s;hame, had almo&s;t publickly aban|doned them&s;elves to di&s;&s;olute practices.</P>
<P>The mi&s;chief was begun by a Roman knight, named Butaetius Barrus, a profe&s;&s;ed libertine, who being tired of too ea&s;y conque&s;ts, &s;ought to vary his infamous plea&s;ures by the charm of difficulty and danger. He therefore attacked a ve&s;tal called Emilia, and when he had &s;ucceeded in &s;educing her, the contagion &s;oon &s;pread; and two other ve&s;tals, Licinia, and Marcia, followed the example of their companion.</P>
<P>Marcia, however, le&s;s criminal than the other two, admitted only one lover; but Emilia and Licinia, who were become great friends, if &s;uch leagues which the wicked form with the wicked may be called by the name of friend&s;hip, not chu&s;ing to confine them&s;elves to their fir&s;t gal|lants, each introduced her brother to her friend, and managed each other's interviews.</P>
<P>Having once begun to extend their criminal amours, they &s;oon had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve that their &s;ecret took air; therefore to engage tho&s;e
<PB N="120" REF="130">
to &s;ilence whom they apprehended would inform again&s;t them, they made them all accomplices in the guilt.</P>
<P>This &s;cene of infamy, after having been long acted in &s;ecret, was at length brought to light by a &s;lave named Manius, who&s;e ma&s;ter was one of Emilia's gallants.</P>
<P>This fellow had been employed by Licinia and her to carry on their intrigues with &s;everal young Romans, and had for &s;ome time acquitted him&s;elf very faithfully in their infamous &s;ervice; but being di&s;appointed in the rewards they had promi&s;ed him, and in his expectations of liberty from his ma&s;ter, he made a full di&s;covery; and the guilty ve&s;tals were immediately brought to trial.</P>
<P>The college of pontiffs, which by the con&s;titu|tion of Numa were the proper judges of this affair, acted with great lenity, and condemned only Emi|lia; a favourable &s;entence was pa&s;&s;ed upon Mar|cia and Licinia, for which the former was probably indebted to her having been le&s;s criminal; and the latter to the eloquence of the celebrated L. Cra&s;|&s;us, her kin&s;man, who being then twenty &s;even years of age, defended her in an oration of which Cicero &s;peaks with prai&s;e.</P>
<P>The unhappy Emilia was buried alive, pur&s;uant to her &s;entence; Marcia and Licinia were ju&s;t recovered from the horrors of that dreadful fate which had impended over them, when a new proce&s;s was commenced again&s;t them.</P>
<P>The whole Roman people exclaimed again&s;t the lenity of the pontiffs, on an occa&s;ion when the crime was equally evident and odious; and the
<PB N="121" REF="131">
tribune Sextus Peduceus having put him&s;elf at the head of tho&s;e who murmured at the &s;entence, cau&s;ed an extraordinary commi&s;&s;ion to be voted by the people for re-hearing the cau&s;e of Marcia and Li|cinia; and at the head of that commi&s;&s;ion placed L. Ca&s;&s;ius, who for that purpo&s;e was created praetor a &s;econd time, after having been con&s;ul and cen&s;or.</P>
<P>He was a per&s;on of rigid virtue and inflexible &s;everity, and one who, as Cicero ob&s;erves, had ren|dered him&s;elf agreeable to the people, not by po|litene&s;s and a popular behaviour, but by an au|&s;terity of manners, which acquired him re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Ca&s;&s;ius fully an&s;wered the expectation of tho&s;e who had cho&s;en him; for he not only condemned the two ve&s;tals, who were puni&s;hed in the &s;ame manner as Emilia, but al&s;o a great number of other per&s;ons; &s;o that his tribunal was called the rock of the accu&s;ed.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE COUNT DE COMMINGE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written by him&s;elf.</BYLINE>
<P>THE hou&s;e of Comminge, from which I am de&s;cended, is one of the mo&s;t ancient and il|lu&s;trious in the kingdom; my great grand-father, who had two &s;ons, was &s;o extremely fond of the younge&s;t, that he &s;ettled &s;ome very con&s;iderable e&s;tates upon him, in prejudice to the rights of his elder brother; and gave him the title of mar|quis of Lu&s;&s;an. The partiality of my ance&s;tor did not weaken the friend&s;hip between his two &s;ons, which encrea&s;ed with their years. They would have their children brought up together; but by giving them their education in common, in&s;tead of uniting them by &s;tricter ties than tho&s;e of blood, which was their &s;ole view in it, they ren|dered them enemies almo&s;t from their birth.</P>
<P>My father, who was always excelled in his ex|erci&s;es by the young marquis of Lu&s;&s;an, conceived a jealou&s;y at it, which &s;oon degenerated into a
<PB N="123" REF="133">
fixed aver&s;ion. They often quarrelled; and my father being always the aggre&s;&s;or, it was he who was always puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>One day, when he complained of this treatment to the &s;teward of our family,
<Q>Know, &s;aid the man to him, that you will have it in your power to repre&s;s the pride of the marquis of Lu&s;&s;an; all the e&s;tates he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es are entailed upon you, and your grandfather could not di&s;po&s;e of them: when you are the ma&s;ter, continued he, it will not be difficult for you to recover your right.</Q></P>
<P>This intimation convincing my father, that he had it in his power to be revenged of his cou&s;in, made him &s;et no bounds to his re&s;entment. Their quarrels became &s;o frequent and &s;o violent, that there was a nece&s;&s;ity for &s;eparating them. They were many years without &s;eeing each other, during which they were both married. The marquis of Lu&s;&s;an had only a daughter by his wife, and my father only a &s;on by his, which was my&s;elf.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as my father came to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his hereditary e&s;tates, by the death of his grand|father, he determined to follow the advice that had been given him, while he was yet a youth, and which he had never lo&s;t &s;ight of: he omitted no|thing that could render his claim unque&s;tionable, and rejecting &s;everal propo&s;als for an accommodation, commenced a law-&s;uit with the marquis of Lu&s;&s;an, which could not but terminate in the de&s;poiling him of all his e&s;tates.</P>
<P>An unhappy rencounter, which they had one day in a hunting-match, rendered them for ever irreconcileable. My father, who&s;e vowed revenge
<PB N="124" REF="134">
was never out of his thoughts, &s;aid &s;everal cruel things to the Marquis of Lu&s;&s;an, upon the de&s;pi|cable condition to which he expected &s;oon to re|duce him. The marquis, tho' naturally mild, could not help an&s;wering with &s;ome haughtine&s;s. They had recour&s;e to their &s;words: fortune de|clared in favour of Mon&s;ieur de Lu&s;&s;an: he di&s;|armed my father, and bid him a&s;k his life.</P>
<P><Q>I &s;hould hate it, an&s;wered my father fierce|ly, if I owed it to thee.</Q>
<Q>Yet, &s;pite of thy&s;elf, thou &s;halt owe it to me,</Q>
&s;aid the marquis, of Lu&s;&s;an, throwing him his &s;word: after which he in&s;tantly left him.</P>
<P>This generous action did not move my father in his favour; on the contrary, the double victory his enemy gained over him, encrea&s;ed his hatred, and he carried on the &s;uit again&s;t the marquis of Lu&s;&s;an more vigorou&s;ly than before. However, when his hopes were highe&s;t he received &s;ome ac|counts from his lawyers, which effectually de&s;troyed them. This di&s;appointment threw him into &s;uch tran&s;ports of rage and grief, as brought on a dan|gerous fever, under which he langui&s;hed a long time, and in this &s;tate I found him at my return from my travels, upon which I had ben &s;ent imme|diately after my &s;tudies were fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>A few days after my arrival, the Abbot de R&mdash;, a kin&s;man of my mother's, &s;ent notice to my father, that the writings which alone were able to prove his ju&s;t claim to the e&s;tates po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the mar|quis of Lu&s;&s;an, were in the archives of the abbey of R&mdash;, to which place many of the papers belong|ing to our family had been carried during the civil
<PB N="125" REF="135">
wars. My father was de&s;ired by the abbot to keep this information &s;ecret, and to come him|&s;elf for tho&s;e writings, or &s;end a per&s;on for them, on who&s;e fidelity he could have an ab&s;olute de|pendance.</P>
<P>The bad &s;tate of his health not permitting him to go him&s;elf, he charged me with this commi&s;&s;ion, after many times repre&s;enting to me, the great im|portance of it.
<Q>You, &s;aid he to me, are more concerned in the recovery of tho&s;e papers, than I am; the e&s;tates will probably &s;oon be yours; but if you had no intere&s;t in them, I think well enough of you, to believe that you &s;hare my re&s;entment, and are eager to revenge the in|juries I have received.</Q>
After giving &s;ome other nece&s;&s;ary in&s;tructions, it was re&s;olved that I &s;hould take the title of marquis of Longaunois, that my bu&s;ine&s;s in the abbey might not be &s;u&s;pected, madame de Lu&s;&s;an having &s;everal relations there.</P>
<P>I &s;et out, accompanied only by an old &s;ervant of my father's, and my own valet de chambre. My journey proved &s;ucce&s;sful: I found in the archives of the abbey the writings which proved inconte&s;ta|bly the entail. I wrote to my father, and gave him an account of all that I had done; and, as I was only at a &s;mall di&s;tance from  <GAP DESC="blank"> , I de&s;ired he would permit me to &s;tay there during the &s;ea&s;on for drinking the waters. My father was &s;o plea&s;ed with the &s;ucce&s;s of my journey, that he readily complied with my reque&s;t.</P>
<P>I &s;till appeared under the borrowed title of the marquis of Langaunois: my equipage was too in|con&s;iderable to &s;upport the grandeur of that of Com|minge.
<PB N="126" REF="136">
The day after my arrival, I went to the fountain: in the&s;e places ceremony is laid a&s;ide, and an ea&s;y polite freedom better &s;upplies its place. From the fir&s;t day of my appearance at the baths, I was admitted into all parties of plea&s;ure, and intro|duced at the hou&s;e of the marquis de la Valette, who that day gave a grand entertainment to the ladies.</P>
<P>I found &s;everal of them whom I had &s;een at the fountain already come, and &s;aid &s;ome tender things to them, as I then thought my&s;elf obliged to do to all women. I was engaged in a particular con|ver&s;ation with one of them, when a lady of a good pre&s;ence entered the room, followed by a girl of &s;urpri&s;ing beauty; her charms fixed my attention immediately, her graceful mode&s;ty won my e&s;teem. I loved her from that moment, and that moment decided the de&s;tiny of my whole life. In&s;en&s;ibly my former gaiety vani&s;hed; I could do nothing but gaze on her, and follow her every where: &s;he perceived it, and blu&s;hed. A walk was propo&s;ed, and I had the good fortune to lead her. We were at a &s;ufficient di&s;tance from the re&s;t of the company to give me an opportunity of talking to her upon a &s;ubject by which my whole thoughts were en|gro&s;&s;ed; but I who a few moments before was not able to remove my eyes from her face, had now when we were alone not courage enough to look upon her. Till then I had always talked of love to women for whom I felt nothing but indifference; but as &s;oon as my heart was really &s;ubdued, I found impo&s;&s;ible to &s;peak.</P>
<P>We rejoined the company, without having ut|tered a &s;ingle word to each other. The ladies were
<PB N="127" REF="137">
conducted to their lodgings, and I returned home, where I &s;hut my&s;elf up in my apartment. In the di&s;po&s;ition my mind was then, &s;olitude was mo&s;t agreeable. I felt a certain kind of joy mixed with pain, which I believe always accompanies a be|ginning pa&s;&s;ion: mine had rendered me &s;o timid, that I dur&s;t not endeavour to know the name of her I loved. I was apprehen&s;ive my curio&s;ity would betray the &s;ecret of my heart; but how did it &s;ink within me, when I learned that it was the daughter of the marquis of Lu&s;&s;an who had charmed me. All the ob&s;tacles that oppo&s;ed my happine&s;s ro&s;e in&s;tantly to my mind; but the fear that Adelaida, &s;o was that lovely girl called, had been early taught to hate my name, was what mo&s;t alarmed me. I thought my&s;elf fortunate in having a&s;&s;umed an|other; and fondly hoped that &s;he would know my pa&s;&s;ion for her before &s;he could be prejudiced again&s;t me; and that when &s;he knew who I was &s;he would at lea&s;t be induced to pity me.</P>
<P>I therefore determined to conceal my true name as long as po&s;&s;ible, and in the mean time to u&s;e every method to plea&s;e her; but I was too much in love to employ any other than that of loving. I followed her wherever &s;he went: I ardently wi&s;hed for an opportunity of &s;peaking to her in private; and when that &s;o much de&s;ired opportunity offered it&s;elf, I had not power to take advantage of it. The fear of forfeiting a thou&s;and little freedoms, which I now enjoyed, re&s;trained me; but my greate&s;t fear was that of offending her.</P>
<P>This was my &s;ituation, when one evening, as the company were walking in &s;eparate parties, Ada|laida
<PB N="128" REF="138">
dropt a bracelet off her arm, to which her pic|ture was fa&s;tened. The chevalier de Saint Oden, who led her, eagerly &s;tooped to take it up, and, after gazing upon it a moment, put it in his pocket. Adelaida at fir&s;t a&s;ked for it mildly; but he ob&s;tinately refu&s;ing to return it, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed great re&s;entment at a behaviour which &s;howed &s;o little re&s;pect for her.</P>
<P>The chevalier was hand&s;ome; &s;ome little &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es with the fair had made him vain and pre|&s;uming. Without being di&s;concerted at Adelai|da's anger,
<Q>Why, mademoi&s;elle, &s;aid he, would you deprive me of a good which I owe only to chance? I flatter my&s;elf, continued he, lower|ing his voice, that when you know the &s;enti|ments you have in&s;pired me with, you will &s;uf|fer me to keep what that has pre&s;ented me.</Q>
Saying this he bowed profoundly low; and, with|out waiting for her an&s;wer, retired.</P>
<P>I happened not to be with her then. The mar|chione&s;s de la Valette and I were talking at a little di&s;tance; but altho' I quitted her as &s;eldom as po&s;|&s;ible, yet my attention was always fixed upon her. I never lo&s;t a look, a word, or action of hers, and however particularly engaged, I never failed in any of tho&s;e a&s;&s;iduities, which others practi&s;e to plea&s;e, but which the exce&s;s of my pa&s;&s;ion made we find inconceivable plea&s;ure in performing.</P>

<HEAD>PHILOSOPHY FOR THE LADIES.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IN the enumeration of tho&s;e &s;tudies which the fair &s;ex may properly be permitted to employ &s;ome part of their time in an application to, given in our la&s;t Number, it may be remembered that hi&s;tory and natural philo&s;ophy &s;tood foremo&s;t in the li&s;t. Curio&s;ity is one of the mo&s;t prevalent, and, when properly applied, one of the mo&s;t amiable, pa&s;&s;ions of the human mind; nor can it in any way find a more rational &s;cope for exertion, than in the recollection of hi&s;torical facts, and a curious inqui|&s;ition into the wonders of creation. To this ap|plication of that pa&s;&s;ion the female part of the world are unque&s;tionably mo&s;t happily adapted. Undi&s;turbed by the more intricate affairs of bu&s;i|ne&s;s; unburthened with the load of political entan|glements; with the anxiety of commercial negotia|tions; or the &s;u&s;pen&s;e and angui&s;h which attend on the pur&s;uit of fame or fortune, the memories of the fair are left vacant to receive and to retain the re|gular
<PB N="130" REF="140">
connection of a train of events, to regi&s;ter them in that order which fancy may point out as mo&s;t plea&s;ing, and to form deductions from them &s;uch as may render their lives more agreeable to them&s;elves, and more &s;erviceable to every one about them. Their more exalted faculties, not be|ing tied down by weari&s;ome attention to mathe|matical inve&s;tigations, metaphy&s;ical chimeras, or ab&s;tru&s;e&s;chola&s;tic learning, are more at liberty to ob|&s;erve with care, &s;ee with per&s;picuity, and judge with|out prejudice, concerning the amazing world of won|ders round them than tho&s;e of men, who, very fre|quently by attempting to arrive at <HI>every</HI> kind of knowledge, find them&s;elves &s;topped &s;hort in their career by the limited period of life, before they can properly be &s;aid to have reached <HI>any</HI></P>
<P>To gratify and furni&s;h food for this laudable cu|rio&s;ity, therefore, in both the&s;e branches of know|ledge, &s;hall be one of our principal aims in the pro|&s;ecution of this work; yet as amu&s;ement no le&s;s than in&s;truction will ever con&s;titute one of the main columns of our edifice, and that our wi&s;h is to render the ladies though learned not pedantic, conver&s;able rather than &s;cientific, we &s;hall avoid entering into any of tho&s;e minutiae, or diving into tho&s;e depths of literature, which may make their &s;tudy dry to them&s;elves, or occa&s;ion its becoming tire&s;ome to others.</P>
<P>If therefore we treat of philo&s;ophy, it &s;hall be poli&s;hed from the ru&s;t of theoretical erudition, and adorned with all tho&s;e advantages which a connex|ion with the politer arts and &s;ciences can throw upon it. If of hi&s;tory, a plea&s;ing relation of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting facts &s;hall be endeavoured at, the move|ment
<PB N="131" REF="141">
of the grand machine of government &s;hall indeed be &s;et before our readers, and the influence of each apparent wheel be rendered vi&s;ible: but we &s;hall think it unnece&s;&s;ary to look into every &s;ecret &s;pring whereby the&s;e wheels were actuated; and &s;hall di&s;pen&s;e with entering into the never to be di&s;covered cau&s;es of the ri&s;e and fall of nations now no more, to make room for the more u&s;eful knowledge of tho&s;e movements of the human heart on which depend the happine&s;s or ruin of in|dividuals. If geography &s;hould form, as we pro|po&s;e it &s;hall, one portion of each number, it will not be with us the meer de&s;cription of large tracts of land, where woods and plains, mountains and valleys, rivers and &s;andy de&s;erts occur alike in all; but only a detail in every country of tho&s;e things which are peculiar to it&s;elf: a picture not of the face of the earth, of &s;ea and air, in different latitudes and longitudes, but a more varied pro&s;pect of hu|man nature diver&s;ified by different laws, by dif|ferent con&s;titutions, and different ideas.</P>
<P>Thus much will be &s;ufficient to premi&s;e in re|gard to the matter of our re&s;earches on the&s;e kind of &s;ubjects, in order to obviate the horrid idea which the word philo&s;ophy might perhaps otherwi&s;e impre&s;s on the minds of our female readers, who might from that term expect to find a work intended and calculated chiefly for their amu&s;ement and in|&s;truction, loaded with dry and ab&s;tru&s;e inve&s;tiga|tions, which &s;ome of them might not have time, or others even want attention, to examine with the application nece&s;&s;ary to become mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of them; and which if they were attained would &s;tand a
<PB N="132" REF="142">
chance of more than ten to one of exciting the outcry of the world again&s;t them.</P>
<P>As to the method we intend to pur&s;ue, how|ever, &s;omething, though not much, will be nece&s;|&s;ary to add. Which will be only to ob&s;erve that no regular cour&s;e of philo&s;ophy, no long train of hi&s;torical events, nor any clo&s;e confinement to one branch of geographical knowledge, &s;hall be aimed at in our e&s;&s;ays on the&s;e &s;ubjects. Variety is the &s;oul of &s;tudy, as well as the plea&s;ure of life; and a thou&s;and u&s;eful pieces of knowledge &s;teal into the vacancies of our mind when detached, which would never find their way thither if they were entangled with each other, or mingled in the grand ma&s;s of philo&s;ophical enquiries.</P>
<P>Learning, in &s;hort, is the old man's bundie of rods: when bound up in the clu&s;ter, it is almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible to be overcome, yet every &s;ingle twig may ea&s;ily be ma&s;tered.

<P>The motives to great and illu&s;trious actions in the loud and bu&s;y occurrences of the world have been u&s;ually incited by ambition: Ambition, united with avarice, has aimed at pre&s;ent aggrandizement; ambition, &s;purred on by fancy, has made future fame its final goal.

<P>Let us then fir&s;t take a view of this mighty ma|chine in the whole, and then de&s;cend to a more immediate di&s;qui&s;ition of its &s;everal parts.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e then, reader, imagine your&s;elf conveyed to &s;ome place beyond even the limits of infinite &s;pace; there ca&s;t your eyes around, and view the number of the &s;tars which glitter in their &s;everal orbs.

all the &s;everal periods of its &s;ea&s;on in eighty-eight of our days. Then in a larger circle, next comes Venus, forming its year in &s;omewhat more than &s;even months.

<P>For the&s;e two planets, placed as they are within the immediate influence of the beams which ema|nate from the great fount of light, tho&s;e rays are full &s;ufficient for their purpo&s;e, unaided by extra|neous a&s;&s;i&s;tance.

The daily revolution of the earth round its own axis, performed in four and twenty hours, combined with that in her own orbit, performed with a velocity of almo&s;t a thou&s;and miles in a minute.

<P>In the fourth circle of the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem rolls, in a period of almo&s;t two years, the planet Mars.

Five moons relieve his almo&s;t total darkne&s;s; nor would even the help of the&s;e avail to chear the gloom which his inhabitants experience, were they not aided by a &s;till brighter band of reflected light formed by the ample ring whereby his body ever is encircled.

Leytimor would of it&s;elf be very incon&s;iderable, were it not for its being the &s;eat of the capital town and for|tre&s;s in the i&s;land, viz. Amboyna and Fort Victory.</P>
<P>The town &s;tands in a fine plain on the coa&s;t of the larger gulph, and is about a quarter of a league in length, and fourteen hundred paces broad. The &s;treets are wide and regular; and altho' they are not paved, yet the &s;oil is &s;o very &s;pungy, that the heavy rains, which frequently &s;ail there, do them much le&s;s damage than one would be apt to expect. It contains about a thou&s;and hou&s;es, ex|clu&s;ive of the public buildings: among&s;t which the
<PB N="148" REF="159">
ca&s;tle, the market-hou&s;e, the church, the guard-hou&s;e, the town-hou&s;e, the ho&s;pital, the orphan-hou&s;e, governor's palace, the old and new Dutch churches, and the company's linnen magazine, are the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, and &s;ome of them very mag|nificent.</P>
<P>The number of inhabitants of the i&s;land of Am|boyna are thought to amount to between &s;eventy and eighty thou&s;and &s;ouls, all of whom are Moors or Mahometans, excepting the people of Leytimor, who, mo&s;t of them profe&s;s Chri&s;tianity, and about five or &s;ix villages of the other part of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>Under the government of Amboyna are included ten other i&s;lands, viz. Bouro, Amblau, Manipa, Kelang, Bonoa, Ceram, Ceram-Laout, Nau&s;&s;a-La|out, Honimoa, and Boangbe&s;i.</P>
<P>The external a&s;pect of all the&s;e i&s;lands pre&s;ent at fir&s;t &s;ight the appearance of the rude&s;t de&s;ert. On whatever &s;ide you turn your eyes, you &s;ee your&s;elf &s;urrounded with lofty mountains, who&s;e tops are lo&s;t in clouds; with frightful rocks riding on one an|other's heads; with horrid caverns, thick woods, &s;hading with almo&s;t a continual darkne&s;s numbers of very deep valleys; and at the &s;ame time your ears are &s;truck with the noi&s;e of rivers ru&s;hing into the &s;ea with horrid roar, e&s;pecially towards the begin|ning of the ea&s;tern mon&s;oon, the time at which the European ve&s;&s;els mo&s;t commonly arrive there.</P>
<P>Yet foreigners who &s;tay there till the we&s;tern mon&s;oon find infinite beauties in the pro&s;pect. The mountains abounding with &s;eago and with cloves; the fore&s;ts cloathed in verdure, and adorned with blo&s;&s;oms; the vallies laden with fertility; the rivers
<PB N="149" REF="160">
rolling with waters pure and chry&s;talline; the very rocks and caverns, which &s;eem but as the &s;hadows in a picture; all the&s;e objects diver&s;ified in &s;o many ways render it one of the fine&s;t countries in the world.</P>
<P>The frequent attacks of the pal&s;y in the&s;e i&s;lands, and the yellowne&s;s of complexion which many per|&s;ons bring from thence with them, have made it be concluded that the air of them is unwhol&s;ome: yet the&s;e di&s;orders are rather to be attributed to the imprudence of travellers, than to the temperament of the climate, the air of which is clear and health|ful. Many have lo&s;t their limbs by &s;leeping in their &s;hirts by moonlight in cool evenings; and the exce&s;&s;ive drinking of the Saguweer, fixes that yel|lowne&s;s &s;o much complained of: but the&s;e are di&s;|orders to which the natives, who take the &s;ame li|quor in moderation, and do not expo&s;e them&s;elves to the air in cold nights, are not &s;ubject to.</P>
<P>Earthquakes and heavy rains are the greate&s;t incon|veniences of the&s;e climates. During the time of the ea&s;tern mon&s;oon, which begins in May, and ends in September, it will &s;ometimes rain for &s;everal weeks together: yet notwith&s;tanding the va&s;t quantity of water which falls direct, and the impetuous tor|rents which pour down from the mountains into the lower grounds, the land being &s;o very &s;pungy the fields &s;oon become dry again. But what is very remarkable is, that the &s;ea&s;on for the&s;e rains is not the &s;ame throughout all the i&s;lands: when it rains at Amboyna, it is frequently very fair at Bouro, Manipa, and other of the lands to the we&s;t. This &s;ea&s;on is often accompanied with violent hurri|canes;
<PB N="150" REF="161">
but earthquakes are more common during the we&s;tern mon&s;oon, which al&s;o la&s;ts for five months. In April and October they have no re|gular winds. The ea&s;terly ones bring rain; the we&s;terly ones a drought: yet both the&s;e, as well as the very plentiful evening dews, are of &s;ervice in tempering the exce&s;&s;ive heats which are &s;ometimes &s;o great in the middle parts of the day as to dry up rivers and cau&s;e the earth to open in clefts of twenty feet deep. In the&s;e &s;ea&s;ons of drought they are al|&s;o incommoded with violent &s;torms of thunder and lightning; and earthquakes are very frequently attendant on the rains which follow the&s;e heats.</P>

<HEAD>NATURAL HISTORY of the I&s;lands of AMBOYNA.</HEAD>
<P>The principal and general product of the&s;e i&s;lands are rice, &s;eago, and cloves: they have, however, great quantities of cocoa nuts, nutmegs, and other vegetable productions. As to animals they have very few peculiar to them&s;elves, excepting &s;ome of the bird kind We will now take a little cir|cuit through the &s;everal i&s;lands, and remark what is to be found worthy of notice in each.</P>
<P>AMBOYNA. In Hitto, or the northern part of this i&s;land, are two mountains almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible; one of which, called Tanita, is the highe&s;t in the whole i&s;land. The top of it is &s;o extremely cold that no kind of animal is to be found on it, ex|cepting &s;ome black lizards, which live in a very thick mo&s;s, wherewith the ground, and even the barks of the trees, are entirely cover'd; and which
<PB N="151" REF="162">
is &s;o extremely moi&s;t, that the water will run out of it with the &s;lighte&s;t pre&s;&s;ure.</P>
<P>BOURO. This i&s;land is many times larger than Amboyna, being about eighteen leagues in length, and upwards of thirteen in breadth. It is remark|able for its very fine woods, among&s;t which three kinds of ebony, the black, the white, and a ba&s;|tard kind between both, are the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h|able.</P>
<P>The internal parts of this i&s;land are fill'd with high mountains and va&s;t fore&s;ts in many places in|acce&s;&s;ible, and which are the habitations of many large &s;erpents and other venomous animals; and the banks of the rivers are infe&s;ted with crocodiles. But what is the mo&s;t wonderful is a large inland lake which is at the top of a mountain about the middle of the i&s;land. This is almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible, the way to it being over &s;teep craigs and fore&s;ts, &s;o thick as to be &s;carce pa&s;&s;able. It is about two leagues and an half over, and nearly round. Its depth in the middle is fifteen or &s;ixteen fathoms, and it is &s;upplied by a very rapid river. It produces no fi&s;h but eels, &s;ome of which are as thick as a man's thigh. There are great number of wild ducks and plover about its borders, and the woods near it abound with a kind of bird, about the &s;ize of a Canary bird, with a black head, red neck, with a ring of white around it, and the wings of a bright gold colour. In &s;hort, by the de&s;cription, they &s;eem much to re&s;emble our goldfinches, and &s;ing delightfully. There are al&s;o in this i&s;land two other hills each almo&s;t in the form of a &s;ugar-loaf, open at the top, and fill'd with water.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="163">On the coa&s;t of the i&s;land of Ceram, which is the large&s;t of them all, being &s;ixty leagues in length, and in &s;ome places fifteen in breadth, is a prodi|gious large rock, at the foot of which Nature has formed &s;everal caverns, which give it the outward appearance of a walled town with its gates. The&s;e caverns &s;ometimes &s;erve for &s;helter to per&s;ons who happen to be overtaken by the night, tho' the re|treat into them is frightful and even dangerous, being very much infe&s;ted with &s;erpents and other venomous reptiles.</P>
<P>In the little i&s;lands of Nou&s;&s;a, Laout, and Ho|nimoa, but e&s;pecially in the latter, is found a kind of &s;oap earth, which the women of that country, when pregnant, devour greedily, from a per&s;ua|&s;ion that it has virtue to make their children fair, al|tho' experience mo&s;t generally has contradicted that opinion.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Oma is remarkable for a &s;pring of hot water, the &s;ulphureous &s;teams of which are received thro' a wooden grate, by way of bath, for the relief of gouty and paralytic per&s;ons; and the ground every where about it is al&s;o extremely hot.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t amazing particular in this i&s;land is a kind of fiery vapour, which is conveyed in the air with certain winds, and by which all the her|bage for a large tract of ground will be almo&s;t in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly con&s;um'd, and the cloaths, hair, and &s;ometimes the faces of per&s;ons expos'd to it, ex|tremely &s;corch'd. Nor have they any means of e&s;caping &s;uffocation from the &s;moke produc'd by
<PB N="153" REF="164">
it, but by throwing them&s;elves flat on the ground with their faces to the earth.</P>
<P>The &s;ea wherewith the&s;e i&s;lands are &s;urrounded pre&s;ent at particular times, viz. during the new moons of June, and Augu&s;t, a very amazing &s;ight. The &s;urface of it appears in the night-time as it were &s;triped with large furrows as white as milk, al|though in the day time no difference is to be &s;een. This white water, which does not mingle with the other, has more or le&s;s extent according as it is increa&s;ed by the rains, which the &s;outh-ea&s;t winds bring along with them: no one has been able to di&s;cover from whence it comes, or whereby it is occa&s;ioned. Some have attributed this whitene&s;s to little animalculae; whil&s;t others imagine it to proceed from &s;ulphureous vapours ri&s;ing from the bottom of the &s;ea, and &s;preading on its &s;urface. It is true there are many mountains of &s;ulphur in this part of the world; but was it occa&s;ioned by them, the like phaenomenon would be met with in other places where &s;uch mountains are; which is not the ca&s;e. When the white water is gone, the &s;ea di&s;|charges a much greater quantity of froth and foam than u&s;ual. This water is extremely dangerous for &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, as the breakers cannot be di|&s;tingui&s;hed through it; &s;hips which are expo&s;ed to it al&s;o rot the &s;ooner, and it is remarked that the fi&s;h con&s;tantly follow the black water.</P>
<P>Another object worthy of notice in tho&s;e &s;eas, is a kind of reddi&s;h worm, which appears every year at a certain time along the &s;hore in many parts of the i&s;land of Amboyna. The u&s;e the inhabitants make of the&s;e worms we &s;hall &s;hew hereafter.</P>

<HEAD>The MANNERS and CUSTOMS of the Inhabi|tants of AMBOYNA.</HEAD>
<P>The inhabitants of the&s;e i&s;lands are of a middle &s;tature, rather lean than fat, and extremely &s;warthy: their features are regular, and there are both men and women of them who are far trom unhand&s;ome. There is however a &s;ort of them, which are called Cakerlaks, who are almo&s;t as white as the Europe|ans; but it is a &s;ort of palene&s;s which has &s;omething frightful in it when one is near them: they are very red hair'd, have large freckles on their hands and faces, and their &s;kin is &s;cur&s;y, rough, and wrin|kled. Their eyes, which are perpetually winking, &s;eem in the day-time half &s;hut, and are &s;o weak that they can &s;carce bear the light; but in the night they &s;ee very clear. The women of this kind are very rare. The&s;e Cakerlaks are a kind of lepers, and are held in great contempt by their country folks&mdash;They take their name from certain flying in&s;ects, which ca&s;t their covering every year, and who&s;e &s;kin re&s;embles that of the&s;e people.</P>
<P>Their habitations are for the mo&s;t part extremely poor and wretched: &s;ome indeed which belong to the principal per&s;ons are built of boards; but the generality are con&s;tructed of gabba-gabbas, or branches of the &s;eago tree, the bark of which is extremely &s;mooth and poli&s;hed. The&s;e hou&s;es make no bad appearance when they are new; but in a &s;hort time, when the gabba-gabbas begin to rot, and the nails and fa&s;tenings which hold them give
<PB N="155" REF="166">
way, they form great gaps which render them ex|tremely inconvenient.</P>
<P>Nor is their furniture more commodious or more plentiful&mdash;A few &s;helves to &s;erve by way of canopy, &s;ome matts to &s;it on, a little earthen ware, a frying-pan, a copper ba&s;on to put their pi&s;ang in, a lamp of the &s;ame mettle, and two or three boxes made of the leaves of the nipa, ornamented with white &s;hells, compo&s;e the principal part of it. The leaves of the pi&s;ang &s;erve them by way of table cloths and napkins, and the &s;hell of the cocoa nuts for &s;poons. The u&s;e of knives is unknown to them, but they do every thing with a kind of cleaver, which they manage very dexterou&s;ly: be&s;ides the&s;e implements, for dome&s;tic u&s;e, they have al&s;o &s;ome arms in their hou&s;es, &s;uch as helmets, bucklers, &s;abres, and javelins.</P>
<P>Their habits are neither more diver&s;ified nor more magnificent: the men wear a kind of clo&s;e-bodied coat and breeches, made of cotton, or &s;ome other &s;tuff, of a blue colour, and for the mo&s;t part un|lined. The women in the hou&s;e wear a &s;ort of petticoat &s;ewed up, but without plaits, and equally open at both ends: this they fa&s;ten at their wai&s;ts to their under habit, which is a kind of &s;hift with the &s;leeves very long, and a little open before, and which reaches down &s;omewhat below the navel. When they go out they put on a &s;econd petticoat, which they throw over their left &s;houlder, in the manner of a cloak; &s;o that only the right &s;ide is to be &s;een.</P>
<P>As fa&s;hion is unknown to the people of this country, all the difference of cloathing among&s;t
<PB N="156" REF="167">
them con&s;i&s;ts in the difference of the &s;tuffs. The Moors have no other di&s;tinction in their dre&s;s from the Chri&s;tians of the i&s;land but that of wearing a turban in&s;tead of the hat, or &s;ometimes red or white handkerchiefs, which the latter fa&s;ten on their heads.</P>
<P>The grandees however are particularly fond of di&s;tingui&s;hing them&s;elves by the magnificence of their dre&s;s and the number of their &s;laves. They al&s;o wear robes of brocade, &s;ilk &s;tockings, and &s;lippers, as marks of their nobility; whereas the commonalty, both men and women, go barefooted, or in wooden &s;andals. The wives of the principal magi&s;trates have the privilege of a kind of mantle, with hanging &s;leeves which comes down to their knees, is generally made of rich flowered &s;ilk, and gives them great con&s;equence among the people. They al&s;o adorn them&s;elves with ear-rings, brace|lets, and necklaces of many kinds, which are mo&s;t|ly made of gold. They wear a hat cut in three or four points, and hold a handkerchief in their hands by way of a fan, which they put before their faces whil&s;t at prayers in the church, where they have chairs; whereas the common women &s;it cro&s;s-leg|ged on mats upon the ground.</P>
<P>As the Amboynians in general are not looked on as the be&s;t &s;oldiers, they are al&s;o but indiffe|rently provided with arms. They have however &s;ome, which if they did but dare to look their ene|mies in the face, might be rendered extremely u&s;e|ful. I have already, under the article of their fur|niture, mentioned the principal of them. Nothing more therefore is nece&s;&s;ary but to &s;ay &s;omething in regard to their &s;tructure.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="168">Their helmets are of bra&s;s adorned with the fea|thers of the bird of paradi&s;e. Of bucklers they have two kinds; one &s;ort, which are three or four feet long, and about one broad, and adorned on the out&s;ide with &s;ome rows of white &s;hells: the other kind is only a &s;mall target made of ru&s;hes, very completely interwoven, about two or three feet diameter, with a &s;pike in the centre, which renders them at the &s;ame time equally commodi|ous for offence. Of both the&s;e &s;hields they avail them&s;elves very &s;kilfully in parrying off the &s;trokes of their antagoni&s;ts. Their right hand is armed offen&s;ively either with a fabre or a javelin: &s;ome of them &s;ub&s;titute, in the room of the&s;e, the bow and arrow, which are in more familiar u&s;e among&s;t the Alfourians, or mountaineers. Their fire-arms, which they acquired the knowledge of from the Europeans, they employ only in &s;porting; nor have they any heavy artillery, excepting a few pat|teraroes on the walls of their fortre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The ordinary navigation of the Amboynians is in a kind of canoes cut out of the trunks of trees, which are ten, twelve, and &s;ometimes even twenty feet long by one or two broad. To either &s;ide of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els they fix a large wing, which, falling on the &s;urface of the water, keeps it always in equilibrium amid&s;t the waves; and as long as the&s;e wings are able to re&s;i&s;t their force, the lightne&s;s of the ve&s;&s;el enables it to make a con&s;iderable pro|gre&s;s in a very &s;mall time; but if once they happen to give way, the canoe infallibly over&s;ets. The&s;e little barks are manned with one or two rowers, be&s;ides the per&s;on who takes care of the helm.
<PB N="158" REF="169">
Their fi&s;hing-boats are broader, being about three or four feet wide, but without any covering, which would be very trouble&s;ome and inconvenient for that u&s;e. Of the &s;ame form as the&s;e, but larger, are the ve&s;&s;els they make u&s;e of in their parties of plea&s;ure. In the middle of them, however, is fixed a &s;quare tent or pavilion, with benches and curtains all round, large enough to contain fifteen or twenty per&s;ons, in proportion to the &s;ize of the boat; by which al&s;o is determined the number of the rowers. The &s;maller Orembayes (for &s;o are the&s;e ve&s;&s;els called) carry ten or twelve, and the larger ones from thirty to forty. The&s;e rowers are arranged towards the head and &s;tern of the boat on planks which project from its two &s;ides: the oars are broad and &s;hort, almo&s;t in the form of a baker's peel, and the &s;trokes of them are regulated by the time of certain in&s;truments of mu&s;ic played on by two men for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>A third kind of bark, which they make u&s;e of, is called the Champan, carries a ma&s;t, and is co|vered; is about ten or twelve tons burthen; and is made great u&s;e of for the conveying goods from one i&s;land to another. The la&s;t &s;ort of &s;hipping which the&s;e people employ are their Coracores, which are large ve&s;&s;els of &s;ometimes an hundred feet in length, and twelve or fourteen in breadth. The meaning of the name is the Sea-tortoi&s;e, which is given to them from their being very heavy and &s;low, altho' with a fair wind they are very convenient, as they have the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ails as well as oars. Some of the&s;e galleys have two, &s;ome three, and others four rows of oars, extending from fifty to
<PB N="159" REF="170">
near an hundred, with room for lodging about the &s;ame number of men, exclu&s;ive of two or three very elegant little apartments for per&s;ons of particular di&s;tinction. Of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, form'd into fleets from fifty to &s;ixty-five, provided with proper arms, and a few pateraroes, they defend their own coa&s;ts from incur&s;ions, and frequently make attacks on their neighbours.</P>
<P>From what we have &s;aid of the habits, dwellings, and furniture of the&s;e people, it appears, that their ne|ce&s;&s;ities can be but few; one would therefore imagine that with a little application, join'd to a very &s;mall degree of oeconomy, it would be ea&s;y for them to in|crea&s;e their means, and even to ama&s;s great riches. But altho' there are &s;everal of them who enjoy a very con&s;iderable income by the profits ari&s;ing from the produce of their cloves, yet they, for the mo&s;t part, expend it all in fea&s;ts, pre&s;ents, and law-&s;uits, in the latter of which they make nothing of throwing away an hundred ducats in the defence of a controverted clove-garden. It is, however, re|markable that in a country where poverty is in a manner the fa&s;hion, there are, neverthele&s;s, no &s;uch thing as beggars: but the wonder will in &s;ome degree cea&s;e when it comes to be con&s;ider'd, that the trees produce in very great abundance certain fruits, the u&s;e of which is not denied to the pa&s;&s;ers-by; and that be&s;ides, no one there ever refu&s;es to a poor man the liberty of cutting as much fire-wood as he has occa&s;ion for in one day, whil&s;t it is very ea&s;ily in his power, with no extraordinary indu&s;try, for him to make three &s;hillings a-day by the &s;ale of
<PB N="160" REF="171">
tho&s;e faggots, two pence of which will amply &s;uf|fice for his day's &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>We have ob&s;erved above that fea&s;ting is one of the articles which ruin the Amboynians, and by which they are perpetually kept in penury and di&s;|tre&s;s. In &s;hort, there are many various occa&s;ions on which they are obliged to give great and &s;ump|tuous entertainments. Of the&s;e they have ordi|nary and extraordinary ones. At tho&s;e which are given on marriages, chri&s;tenings, burials, &amp;c. all the relations are invited; but no one comes empty-handed. Every per&s;on thinks him&s;elf obliged to contribute a certain number of di&s;hes: and the&s;e pre&s;ents are carried with great ceremony and abun|dance of o&s;tentation by their &s;laves, one following another, in large bra&s;en ba&s;ons, each cover'd with an embroidered handkerchief, thro' which, how|ever, it is ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h what is underneath.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, three or four per&s;ons are con&s;tantly employed for what might ea&s;ily be performed by one; each endeavouring to out&s;hine the other in the quan|tity of his pre&s;ents and the number of his dome&s;tics.</P>

<P>_WHEN '&s;quire Bicker&s;taff, in the time of our mothers, &s;uch a time as, if their ac|counts may be tru&s;ted, is never likely to return, took upon him to entertain the town, he endeavoured to &s;ecure a kind recep|tion by deducing his genealogy, and proving his relation to the whole family of the <HI>Staffs</HI></P>
<P>If you can either by proximity of blood, or &s;i|militude of mind, &s;hew your alliance to the nume|rous and powerful generation of <HI>Triflers,</HI> you may &s;et any other race of mortals at defiance; for very little is to be feared from any power again&s;t which the Triflers &s;hall form a combination.</P>
<P>I have always had the honour of being numbered among the Triflers; my mother, my grand-mother,
<PB N="162" REF="173">
and my grand-mother's mother, were all Triflers before me. You know, if you know any thing of Trifles, that it is the peculiar practice of our fa|mily to count their pedigree on the female &s;ide. By the advantage of a &s;trong memory, diligently &s;tored with repeated narratives, I have an exact knowledge of the whole &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Trifles, which have engaged the elegant and gay for two centuries and a half.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid in one of Steel's comedies, that nobody de&s;pi&s;es the honours of ance&s;try but tho&s;e that want them; and therefore I will not lo&s;e any advantage of hereditary excellency. My mother was the be&s;t knotter of queen Mary's court; my aunt <HI>Pen</HI> was the third lady that in the reign of Charles the Second tied ribands to her nipples; my grand-mo|ther was a country gentlewoman, and has left little behind her except a &s;cented pa&s;te, with which the beauties of her time u&s;ed to clear their &s;kins with|out the help of water.

<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, madam, you will now allow me to be a genuine and legitimate Trifler; and I &s;hould be glad that you could by equal authority clear your preten&s;ions to a place among the &s;i&s;terhood. Tri|flers are always jealous; and I will not conceal my &s;u&s;picions, that you are claiming a character with|out right; and that your life has not been pa&s;&s;ed regularly among us; that you have either wanted the initiation of the boarding-&s;chool, or the com|pletion of the ball-room.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="174">I know, that it is common enough among peri|odical authors to forget their titles: they fill their heads with the theory of a plan which experience &s;oon &s;hews them to be too narrow to la&s;t long. The Tatler often talks with the mo&s;t &s;olemn au&s;|terity of wi&s;dom, and the Guardian deviates into many topicks with which as a Guardian he has no concern; but none ever &s;tarted from her own pur|po&s;e &s;o &s;oon as the Trifler; and therefore I am afraid, that &s;he has taken a province which &s;he can|not fill.</P>
<P>To the fir&s;t paper I made no objection: it is na|tural to a Trifler to think her own adventures im|portant, and to tell them to tho&s;e who do not wi&s;h to hear them: but the &s;econd paper has betrayed you. Can you think love and court&s;hip &s;ubjects for a Trifler? If love be a Trifle, what can we call &s;erious? The truth is that almo&s;t all other female employments are the &s;ports of idlene&s;s; and that they &s;eldom cea&s;e to trifle till they begin to love.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible in reading a book not to form &s;ome image of the writer. You have told us little of your&s;elf; and therefore your readers are left to their own conjectures. To tell you the truth, I conceive you to be a rural virgin, that after having pa&s;&s;ed about thirty years between reading and needle-work among groves and brooks, has at the invitation of &s;ome great lady left her grotto and bower, and come to take a view of the &s;cenes of life, with no other ideas of love or plea&s;ure than &s;he has gathered from the amours and amu&s;ements of her own village.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="175">I do not wonder that to a votare&s;s of &s;tudious tranquility, the whole bu&s;tle of the town appears a Trifle. Much of the &s;plendor, and much of the cares of life, I &s;hall willingly give up to your &s;port or cen&s;ure. You may &s;ay what you will of plea|&s;ures where no heart is light, of connections with|out kindne&s;s, of &s;truggles for precedency, of com|petitions for the newe&s;t fa&s;hion; but believe me, dear Dryad, to love and to be loved is a &s;erious bu|&s;ine&s;s; and whatever cu&s;toms of court&s;hip, caprice, levity, or vanity, have dictated, however the modes of approach between the &s;exes may be varied by the accidents of time or place, it is not for the Trifler to treat as Trifles tho&s;e operations which unite us for ever to tyrants or to friends, to &s;avages or to &s;ages, and which terminate the flighty wit, or airy flutterer in a wife, an economi&s;t, a mother, and a grand-mother.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF HARRIOT AND SOPHIA CONTINUED.</HEAD>
<P>SOphia, as if afraid &s;he had &s;aid too much, &s;topped abruptly, and, fixing her eyes on the ground, continued &s;ilent, and lo&s;t in thought.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, who had well con&s;idered the pur|port of her words, pa&s;&s;ed over what he thought would give her too much pain to be explicite upon, and an&s;wered in great concern,
<Q>Then my fears are true: Sir Charles is not di&s;po&s;ed to act like a man of honour.</Q></P>
<P>A &s;udden blu&s;h glowed in the cheeks of Sophia at the mention of Sir Charles's name; but it was not a blu&s;h of &s;oftne&s;s and confu&s;ion. Anger and di&s;dain took the place of that &s;weet complacency, which was the u&s;ual expre&s;&s;ion of her countenance, and with a voice &s;omewhat rai&s;ed, &s;he replied ea|gerly.</P>
<P><Q>Sir Charles I believe has deceived me; but him I can de&s;pi&s;e&mdash;Yet do not imagine, Sir, that he has dared to in&s;ult me by any unworthy propo&s;als: if he has any unju&s;tifiable views upon me, he has not had pre&s;umption enough to
<PB N="166" REF="177">
make me acquainted with them, otherwi&s;e than by neglecting to convince me that they are honourable; but he practi&s;es upon the ea&s;y cre|dulity of my mother. He lays &s;nares for her gratitude by an intere&s;ted genero&s;ity, as I now too plainly perceive; and he has the art to make her &s;o much his friend, that &s;he will not li&s;ten to any thing I &s;ay, which implies the lea&s;t doubt of his honour.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Herbert &s;ighed, and ca&s;t down his eyes. Sophia continued in great emotion:
<Q>It is impo&s;|&s;ible for me, Sir, to make you comprehend all the difficulties of my &s;ituation. A man who takes every form to en&s;nare my affections, but none to convince my judgment, importunes me continually with declarations of tenderne&s;s, and complaints of my coldne&s;s and indifference; what can I do? what ought I to an&s;wer to &s;uch di&s;cour&s;e? In this perplexity, why will not my mother come to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance? Her years, her authority as a parent give her a right to require &s;uch an explanation from Sir Charles as may free me from doubts, which although rea&s;on &s;ug|ge&s;ts, delicacy permits me not to make appear; but &s;uch is my misfortune, that I cannot per|&s;uade my mother there is the lea&s;t foundation for my fears. She is ob&s;tinate in her good opi|nion of Sir Charles; and I am reduced to the &s;ad nece&s;&s;ity of either acting in open contradic|tion to her &s;entiments and commands, or of continuing in a &s;tate of humiliating &s;u&s;pence, to which my character mu&s;t at la&s;t fall a &s;acri|fice.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="178">
<Q>That, my dear child, interrupted Mr. Her|bert, is a point that ought to be con&s;idered. I would not mention it to you fir&s;t; but &s;ince your own good &s;en&s;e has led the way to it, I will frankly own that I am afraid, innocent and good as you are, the cen&s;ures of the world will not &s;pare you, if you continue to receive Sir Charles's vi&s;its, doubtful as his intentions now appear to every one: I know Mrs. Darnley judges of the &s;incerity of his profe&s;&s;ions to you by the genero&s;ity he has &s;hewn in the pre&s;ents he has heaped upon her&mdash;but, my dear child, that genero&s;ity was always &s;u&s;pected by me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I confe&s;s, &s;aid Sophia, blu&s;hing, I once thought favourably of him for the attention he &s;hewed to make my mother's life ea&s;y; but if his libe|rality to her be indeed, as you &s;eem to think, a &s;nare, what opinion ought I to form of his mo|tives for a late offer he has made her, and which at fir&s;t dazzled me, &s;o noble and &s;o di&s;in|tere&s;ted did it appear!</Q></P>
<P><Q>I know no offer but one, interrupted Mr. Herbert ha&s;tily, which you ought even to have li&s;tened to.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Then the &s;ecret admonitions of my heart were right,</Q>
cried Sophia, with an accent that at once expre&s;&s;ed exultation and grief.</P>
<P><Q>But what was this offer, child, &s;aid Mr. Her|bert? I am impatient to know it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I will tell you the whole affair as it happened, re&s;umed Sophia; but you mu&s;t not be &s;urpri&s;ed, that my mother was plea&s;ed with Sir Charles's offer. He has been her benefactor, and has a
<PB N="168" REF="179">
claim to her regard: it would be &s;trange if &s;he had not a good opinion of him. You know what that celebrated divine &s;ays who&s;e writings you have made me acquainted with: <HI>Charity it&s;elf commands us where we know no ill, to think well of all; but friend&s;hip, that goes always a pitch higher, gives a man a peculiar right and claim to the good opinion of his friend.</HI> My mother may be mi&s;taken in the judgment &s;he has formed of Sir Charles; but it is her friend&s;hip, for him, a friend&s;hip founded upon gratitude for the good offices he has done her, that has given ri&s;e to this mi&s;take.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia, in her eagerne&s;s to ju&s;tify her mother, forgot that &s;he had rai&s;ed Mr. Herbert's curio&s;ity, and left it un&s;atisfied; and the good old man, charmed with the filial tenderne&s;s &s;he &s;hewed upon this occa&s;ion, li&s;tened to her with complacency, tho' not with conviction. At length &s;he &s;uddenly recollected her&s;elf, and entered upon her &s;tory; but a certain he&s;itation in her &s;peech, accompanied with a ba&s;hful air that made her withdraw her eyes from him, to fix them on the ground, intimated plainly enough her own &s;entiments of the affair &s;he was going to acquaint him with.</P>
<P><Q>You know, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, Sir Charles has had a fit of illne&s;s lately, which alarmed all his friends. My mother was particularly attentive to him upon this occa&s;ion, and I believe he was &s;en&s;ibly affected with her kind concern for him. When he recovered, he begged my mother, my &s;i&s;ter, and my&s;elf, would accompany him in a little excur&s;ion to Hamp&s;tead to take the air.
<PB N="169" REF="180">
We dined there, and returning home early in the evening, as we pa&s;&s;ed through Brook|&s;treet, he ordered the coach to &s;top at the door of a very genteel hou&s;e, which appeared to be newly painted and fitted up. Sir Charles de|&s;ired us to go in with him and look at it, and give him our opinion of the furniture. No|thing could be more elegant and genteel, and we told him &s;o; at which he appeared extreme|ly plea&s;ed, for all had been done, he &s;aid, accord|ing to his directions.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He came home with us, and drank tea; after which he had a private conver&s;ation with my mother, which la&s;ted about a quarter of an hour; and when they returned to the room in which they had left my &s;i&s;ter and I, Sir Charles appeared to me to have an unu&s;ual thoughtful|ne&s;s in his countenance, and my mother looked as if &s;he had been weeping; yet there was, at the &s;ame time, an expre&s;&s;ion of &s;atisfaction in her face.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He went away immediately; and my mother, when, eager to give vent to the emotions which filled her heart, exclaimed, Oh, Sophia, how much are you obliged to the generous affection of that man!</Q></P>
<P><Q>You may imagine, Sir, pur&s;ued Sophia, in a &s;weet confu&s;ion, that I was greatly affected with the&s;e words. I begged my mother to explain her&s;elf. Sir Charles, &s;aid &s;he, has made you a pre&s;ent of that hou&s;e which we went to view this afternoon; and here, added &s;he, giving me a paper, is a deed by which he has &s;ettled three hundred pounds a year upon you.</Q></P>

<Q>I was &s;ilent, &s;o was my &s;i&s;ter, who looked at me as if impatient to know my thoughts of this extraordinary genero&s;ity. My thoughts indeed were &s;o perplexed, my notions of this manner of acting &s;o confu&s;ed and uncertain, that I knew not what to &s;ay. My mother told us Sir Charles had declared to her, that his late illne&s;s had given him occa&s;ion for many unea&s;y reflections upon my account; that he &s;huddered with hor|ror when he con&s;idered the unhappy &s;tate of my fortune, and to what difficulties I &s;hould have been expo&s;ed if he had died; and that, for the &s;atisfaction of his own mind, he had made that &s;ettlement upon me, that whatever happened I might be out of the reach of nece&s;&s;ity.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I am afraid, Sir, pur&s;ued Sophia with a little confu&s;ion in her countenance, that you will con|demn me when I tell you I was &s;o &s;truck at fir&s;t with the &s;eeming candor and tenderne&s;s of Sir Charles's motives for this act of genero&s;ity, that none but the mo&s;t grateful &s;entiments ro&s;e in my mind.</Q></P>
<P><Q>No, my dear, replied Mr. Herbert, I do not condemn you: this &s;nare was artfully laid; but when was it that your heart, or rather your rea|&s;on, gave you tho&s;e &s;ecret admonitions you &s;poke of.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Immediately, &s;aid Sophia: a moment's reflec|tion upon the conduct of Sir Charles &s;erved to &s;hew me that &s;ome latent de&s;ign lay concealed under this &s;pecious offer; but I am obliged to my &s;i&s;ter for giving me a more di&s;tinct notion of it than my own confu&s;ed ideas could furni&s;h me with.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="184">"Then you de&s;ired to know her opinion," &s;aid Mr. Herbert.</P>
<P><Q>Certainly, re&s;umed Sophia, this conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed in her pre&s;ence, and as my elder &s;i&s;ter &s;he had a right to be con&s;ulted.</Q></P>
<P>"Pray what did &s;he &s;ay?" a&s;ked Mr. Herbert impatiently.</P>
<P><Q>You know, Sir, &s;aid Sophia, with a gentle &s;mile, my &s;i&s;ter takes every opportunity to rally me about my preten&s;ions to wit: &s;he told me it was great conde&s;cen&s;ion in me, who thought my|&s;elf wi&s;er than all the world be&s;ides, to a&s;k her advice upon this occa&s;ion; and that &s;he would not expo&s;e her&s;elf to my contempt, by declaring her opinion any farther than that &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed Sir Charles did not con&s;ider this as a marriage-&s;ettlement.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The&s;e la&s;t words, pur&s;ued Sophia, who&s;e face was now covered with a deeper blu&s;h, let in &s;o much light upon my mind, that I was a&s;hamed and angry with my&s;elf for having doubted a moment of Sir Charles's in&s;incerity. I thanked my &s;i&s;ter, and told her &s;he &s;hould &s;ee that I would profit by the hint &s;he had given me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I wi&s;h, interrupted Mr. Herbert, that &s;he may profit as much by you; but people of good un|der&s;tanding learn more from the ignorant than the ignorant do from them, becau&s;e the wi&s;e avoid the follies of fools, but fools will not fol|low the example of the wi&s;e: but what did Mrs. Darnley &s;ay to this?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I never &s;aw her &s;o angry with my &s;i&s;ter before, replied Sophia: &s;he &s;aid &s;everal &s;evere things to
<PB N="172" REF="185">
her, which made her leave the room in great emotion; and when we were alone I endeavoured to convince my mother that it was not fit I &s;hould make my&s;elf a dependant upon Sir Charles, by accepting &s;uch con&s;iderable pre&s;ents: &s;he was however of a different opinion, becau&s;e Sir Charles's behaviour had been always re&s;pectful in the highe&s;t degree to me, and becau&s;e the manner in which he made this offer left no room to &s;u&s;pect that he had any other de&s;ign in it but to &s;ecure a provi&s;ion for me, in ca&s;e any thing &s;hould happen to him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Your mother impo&s;es upon her&s;elf, replied Mr. Herbert; but I hope, my dear child, you think more ju&s;tly.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You may judge of my &s;entiments, Sir, an|&s;wered Sophia, by the re&s;olution I have taken: I wi&s;hed to con&s;ult you; but as I had no oppor|tunity for it, I &s;atisfied my&s;elf with doing what I thought you would approve. My mother, pre&s;t by my arguments, told me in a peevi&s;h way that I might act as I thought proper: upon which I retired, and, &s;atisfied with this permi&s;|&s;ion, I enclo&s;ed the &s;ettlement in a cover directed for Sir Charles. I had ju&s;t &s;ealed it, and was going to &s;end it away, when my mother came into my room: I perceived &s;he was de&s;irous to renew the conver&s;ation about Sir Charles; but I carefully avoided it, for fear me &s;hould retract the permi&s;&s;ion &s;he had given me to act as I plea&s;ed upon this occa&s;ion. My re&s;erve piqued her &s;o much, that &s;he forbore to enter upon the &s;ubject again; but as I had no opportunity of
<PB N="173" REF="186">
&s;ending my letter that night without her know|ledge, I was obliged to go to bed much richer than I de&s;ired to be; and the next morning, when we were at breakfa&s;t, a letter was brought me from Sir Charles, dated four o'clock, in which he informed me that he was ju&s;t &s;etting out in a po&s;t-chai&s;e for Bath. His uncle, who lies there at the point of death, has it &s;eems earne&s;tly de|&s;ired to &s;ee him, and the me&s;&s;enger told him he had not a minute to lo&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I am &s;orry, interrupted Mr. Herbert, that he did not get your letter before he went.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia then taking it out of her pocket, gave it to him, and begged he would contrive &s;ome way to have it &s;afely delivered to Sir Charles;
<Q>and now, added &s;he, my heart is ea&s;y on that &s;ide, and I have nothing to do but to arm my&s;elf with fortitude to bear the tender reproaches of a mother who&s;e anxiety for my intere&s;t makes her &s;ee this affair in a very different light from that in which you and I behold it.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Herbert put the letter carefully into his pocket-book, and promi&s;ed her it &s;hould be con|veyed to Sir Charles; then taking her hand, which he pre&s;s'd affectionately,
<Q>You have another &s;acri|fice yet to make, my dear good child, &s;aid he, and I hope it will not co&s;t you much to make it. You mu&s;t re&s;olve to &s;ee Sir Charles no more: it is not fit you &s;hould receive his vi&s;its, &s;ince you &s;u&s;pect his de&s;igns are not honourable, and you have but too much cau&s;e for &s;u&s;picion. It is not enough to be virtuous: we mu&s;t appear &s;o like|wi&s;e; we owe the world a good example, the
<PB N="174" REF="187">
world, which oftener rewards the appearances of merit than merit it&s;elf. It will be impo&s;&s;ible for you to avoid &s;eeing Sir Charles &s;ometimes, if you continue with your mother: you have no autho|rity to forbid his vi&s;its here; and whether you &s;hare them or not, they will be all placed to your account. Are you willing, Mi&s;s Sophia, to go into the country, and I will board you in the fa|mily of a worthy clergyman, who is my friend? His wife and daughters will be agreeable com|panions for you; you will find books enough in his &s;tudy to employ tho&s;e hours which you de|vote to reading, and his conver&s;ation will be al|ways a &s;ource of in&s;truction and delight.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia, with tears in her eyes, and a look &s;o ex|pre&s;&s;ive that it conveyed a &s;tronger idea of the grateful &s;entiments which filled her heart, than any words could do, thanked the good old man for his generous offer, and told him &s;he was ready to leave London whenever he plea&s;ed: but un|willing to be an incumbrance upon his little fortune, &s;he intreated him to be diligent in his enquiries for a place for her, that &s;he might early inure her|&s;elf to the humble condition which providence thought fit to allot for her.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert entering into her delicate &s;cruples, promi&s;ed to procure her a proper e&s;tabli&s;hment; and it was agreed between them that he &s;hould acquaint her mother the next day with the re&s;o|lution &s;he had taken, and endeavour to procure her con&s;ent to it.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert well knew all the difficulties of this ta&s;k, and prepared him&s;elf to &s;u&s;tain the &s;torm
<PB N="175" REF="188">
which he expected would fall upon him. He vi|&s;ited Mrs. Darnley in the morning, and finding her alone, entered at once into the affair, by tel|ling her that he had performed the commi&s;&s;ion Mi&s;s Sophia had given him; that a friend of his who was going to Bath would take care to deliver her letter to her unworthy lover, who, added he, will be convinced, by her returning his &s;ettlement, that &s;he has a ju&s;t notion of his ba&s;e de&s;igns, and de&s;pi&s;es him as well for his fal&s;hood and pre&s;ump|tion, as for the mean opinion he has entertained of her.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, who was perfectly well acquainted with Mrs. Darnley's character, and had &s;tudied his part, would not give her time to recover from the a&s;toni&s;hment his fir&s;t words had thrown her into, which was &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed upon her coun|tenance, and which &s;eemed to deprive her of the power of &s;peech; but added, with an air natural enough,
<Q>Your conduct, Mrs. Darnley, de&s;erves the highe&s;t prai&s;es; indeed I know not which to admire mo&s;t; your di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, prudence, and judgment; or Mi&s;s Sophia's ready obedience, and the noble &s;acrifice &s;he makes to her honour and reputation. You knew her virtue might be &s;ecurely depended upon, and you permitted her to act as &s;he thought proper with regard to the in&s;idious offer Sir Charles made her: thus, by transferring all the merit of a refu&s;al to her, you reflect a double lu&s;tre upon your own, and &s;he has fully an&s;wered your intentions by reject|ing that offer with the contempt it de&s;erved.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="189">While Mr. Herbert went on in this &s;train, Mrs. Darnley in&s;en&s;ibly forgot her re&s;entment; her features a&s;&s;umed all that complacency which gratified vanity and &s;elf-applau&s;e could impre&s;s upon them: and although &s;he was con&s;cious her &s;entiments were very different from tho&s;e which Mr. Herbert attributed to her, yet, as &s;he had really &s;poke tho&s;e words to Sophia which had given her a pretence to act as &s;he had done, &s;he concluded his prai&s;es were &s;incere, and enjoyed them as much as if &s;he had de&s;erved them.</P>
<P>It was her bu&s;ine&s;s now, however vexed at her daughter's folly, as &s;he conceived it, to &s;eem highly &s;atisfied with her conduct, &s;ince what &s;he had done could not be recalled; yet inwardly fretting at the lo&s;s of &s;o noble a pre&s;ent, all her di&s;&s;imulation could not hinder her from &s;aying, that although &s;he approved of Sophia's refu&s;al, yet &s;he could not help thinking &s;he had been very precipitate, and that &s;he ought to have waited till Sir Charles re|turned; and not have &s;ent, but have given him back his &s;ettlement.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, without an&s;wering to that point, told her, that what now remained for her prudence to do was, to take away all foundation for &s;lander, by peremptorily forbidding Sir Charles's future vi&s;its. Here Mrs. Darnley began to frown;
<Q>for, &s;ince it is plain to us all, madam, pur&s;ued he, without &s;eeming to perceive her emotion, that marriage is not his intention, by being allowed to continue his addre&s;&s;es, mi&s;s Sophia's character will &s;uffer greatly in the opinion of the world; and the wi&s;dom and di&s;cretion by which you have hitherto
<PB N="177" REF="190">
been governed in this affair, will not &s;ecure you from very unfavourable cen&s;ures. To &s;hew there|fore how much you are in earne&s;t to prevent them, I think it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that you &s;hould &s;end your daughter out of this man's way.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley, who thought &s;he had an unan|&s;werable objection to make to this &s;cheme, inter|rupted him eagerly,
<Q>You know my circum&s;tances, Mr. Herbert, you know I cannot afford to &s;end my daughter from me; how am I to di&s;po&s;e of her, pray?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Let not that care trouble you, madam, replied Mr. Herbert, I will take all this expence upon my&s;elf: I love Mi&s;s Sophia as well as if &s;he was my own child; and &s;lender as my income is, I will be at the charge of her maintainance till fortune and her own merit place her in a better &s;ituation.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Herbert then acquainted her with the name and character of the clergyman in who&s;e family he intended to board Sophia: he added, that the place to which &s;he was going being at no great di&s;tance, &s;he might hear from her frequently, and &s;ometimes vi&s;it her, without much expence or inconvenience.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley having nothing that was rea&s;on|able to oppo&s;e to the&s;e kind and generous offers, had recour&s;e to rage and exclamation. She told Mr. Herbert that he had no right to interpo&s;e in the affairs of her family; that he &s;hould not di&s;|po&s;e of her child as he plea&s;ed; that &s;he would ex|ert the authority of a parent, and no officious medler &s;hould rob her of her child.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="191">Mr. Herbert now found it nece&s;&s;ary to change his method with this intere&s;ted mother,
<Q>Take care, madam, &s;aid he, with a &s;evere look, how far you carry your oppo&s;ition in this ca&s;e: the world has its eyes upon your conduct; do not give it rea&s;on to &s;ay that your daughter is more prudent and cautious than you are; nor force her to do that without your con&s;ent which you ought to be the fir&s;t to advi&s;e her to.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Without my con&s;ent! replied Mrs. Darnley, almo&s;t breathle&s;s with rage; will &s;he go without my con&s;ent, &s;ay you; have you alienated her af|fections from me &s;o far? I will &s;oon know that.</Q></P>
<P>Then ri&s;ing with a furious air, &s;he called Sophia, who came into the room, trembling, and in the utmo&s;t agitation. The melancholy that appeared in her countenance, her palene&s;s and di&s;order, the con&s;equences of a &s;leeple&s;s night, which &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed in various and afflicting thoughts, made Mr. Herbert apprehen&s;ive that her mother's ob&s;tinacy would prove too hard for her gentle di&s;po&s;ition; and that her heart, thus a&s;&s;aulted with the mo&s;t powerful of all pa&s;&s;ions, love and filial tenderne&s;s, would in&s;en&s;ibly betray her into a con&s;ent to &s;tay.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley giving her a look of indignation, exclaimed with the &s;arca&s;tic &s;everity with which &s;he u&s;ed formerly to treat her;
<Q>So my wi&s;e, my du|tiful daughter, you cannot bear, it &s;eems, to live with your mother; you are re&s;olved to run away from me, are you?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Madam, replied Sophia, with a firmne&s;s that di&s;concerted Mrs. Darnley, as much as it plea&s;|ingly &s;urpri&s;ed Mr. Herbert, it is not you I am run|ning
<PB N="179" REF="192">
away from, as you unkindly &s;ay, I am go|ing into the country to force my&s;elf from the pur&s;uits of a man who has impo&s;ed upon your goodne&s;s, and my credulity; one who I am con|vinced, &s;eeks my di&s;honour, and who&s;e en&s;naring addre&s;&s;es have already, I am afraid, given a wound to my reputation, which nothing but the re&s;olution I have taken to avoid him can heal.</Q></P>
<P>Poor Sophia, who had with difficulty prevailed over her own &s;oftne&s;s to &s;peak in this determined manner, could not bear to &s;ee the confu&s;ion into which her an&s;wer had thrown her mother; but &s;ighing deeply, &s;he retired towards the window, and wiped away the tears that fell from her charming eyes.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley, who ob&s;erved her emotion, and well knew how to take advantage of that amiable weakne&s;s in her temper, which made any oppo|&s;ition, however ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary, painful to her de&s;ired Mr. Herbert to leave her alone with her daughter, adding, that his pre&s;ence was a con&s;traint upon them both.</P>
<P>Sophia hearing this, and dreading le&s;t he &s;hould leave her to &s;u&s;tain the &s;torm alone, went towards her mother, and with the mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive look and accent, begged her not to part in anger from Mr. Herbert.</P>
<P><Q>I cannot forgive Mr. Herbert, &s;aid Mrs. Darn|ley, for &s;uppo&s;ing I am le&s;s concerned for your honour than he is. I &s;ee no nece&s;&s;ity for your going into the country; your reputation is &s;afe while you are under my care; it is time enough to &s;end you out of Sir Charles's way when we
<PB N="180" REF="193">
are convinced his de&s;igns are not honourable. Mr. Herbert, by filling your head with groundle&s;s apprehen&s;ions, will be the ruin of your fortune.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Sir Charles's di&s;&s;embled affection for me, in|terupted Sophia, will be the ruin of my character. There is no way to convince the world that I am not the willing dupe of his artifices, but by flying from him as far as I can: do not, my dear mamma, pur&s;ued &s;he, bur&s;ting into tears, oppo&s;e my going; my peace of mind, my re|putation depend upon it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You &s;hall go when I think proper, replied Mrs. Darnley; and as for you, Sir, turning to Mr. Herbert, I de&s;ire you will not interpo&s;e any farther in this matter.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Indeed I mu&s;t, madam, &s;aid the good old man, encouraged by a look Sophia gave him. I con|&s;ider my&s;elf as guardian to your daughter, and in that quality I pretend to &s;ome right to regu|late her conduct on an occa&s;ion which requires a guardian's care and authority.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ridiculous! exclaimed Mrs. Darnley, with a malignant &s;neer, what a je&s;t! to call your&s;elf guardian to a girl who has not a &s;hilling to de|pend upon.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I am the guardian of her honour and repu|tation, &s;aid Mr. Herbert: the&s;e make up her fortune; and with the&s;e &s;he is richer than if &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed thou&s;ands without them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And do you, mi&s;s, &s;aid Mrs. Darnley to her daughter, with a &s;cornful air, do you allow this fooli&s;h claim? Are you this gentleman's ward, pray?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="194">
<Q>Come, madam, &s;aid Mr. Herbert, willing to &s;pare Sophia the pain of an&s;wering her que&s;tion, be per&s;uaded that I have the tenderne&s;s of a parent, as well as guardian, for your daughter: it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary &s;he &s;hould &s;ee Sir Charles no more; and the mo&s;t effectual method &s;he can take to &s;hun him, and to pre&s;erve her character, is to leave a place where &s;he will be continually expo&s;ed to his importunity. I hope &s;he will be able to procure your con&s;ent to her going to|morrow. I &s;hall be here in the morning with a po&s;t-chai&s;e, and will conduct her my&s;elf to the hou&s;e of my friend, whom I have already pre|pared by a letter to receive her.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, without waiting for any an&s;wer, bowed and left the room. Sophia followed him to the door, and by a &s;peaking glance a&s;&s;ured him he might depend upon her per&s;everance.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE Author of the LADY's MUSEUM.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I apprehend the object of this publication is no le&s;s the moral than the literary improve|ment of your &s;ex, permit me, through the channel of this u&s;eful work, to point out to your fair rea|ders the fatal con&s;equences of an opinion too ge|nerally received among them.</P>
<P>The opinion I could wi&s;h to &s;ee corrected is, that grandeur and happine&s;s &s;ignify one and the &s;ame thing. How far the &s;ame wrong notion prevails among men, is not my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to examine; but I will venture, to affirm, that in the &s;y&s;tem of fe|male logic, grandeur and happine&s;s are convertible terms. It is not &s;urpri&s;ing that this notion &s;hould be extremely prevalent, when we con&s;ider, that the whole &s;y&s;tem of female education tends to promote and extend it. Whence is it, that many mi&s;&s;es are in&s;tructed in accompli&s;hments evidently above their rank, but in order to obtain a &s;tation in life to which they could not rea&s;onably a&s;pire.</P>
<P>In truth, it is more the vanity of being thought to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch accompli&s;hments than any plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from tho&s;e attainments, that is the induce|ment to pur&s;ue them. I have been a&s;&s;ured by the parents of many young ladies, that their daughters were perfect mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of French, mu&s;ick, &amp;c. when upon a better acquaintance, I plainly per|ceived, they had been at much expence only to &s;ay they had been learners.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="196">I would not be thought to mean, that the po|lite accompli&s;hments are not very u&s;eful and be|coming to per&s;ons of a certain rank and character; but I would ob&s;erve, that the promi&s;cuous aim of all ranks of females, to acquire tho&s;e elegant di&s;|tinctions, evidently proves my fir&s;t principle, namely, that an appetite for vanity and &s;plendor pervades the whole &s;y&s;tem of modern education.</P>
<P>The polite attainments too frequently give young ladies of middling &s;tation an unhappy pro|pen&s;ity to di&s;&s;ipation and plea&s;ure, and indi&s;po&s;e them to the ordinary and nece&s;&s;ary occupations of life. It may be u&s;eful to con&s;ider what probability there is, that an appetite for di&s;tinction may be gratified, and then examine what &s;uperior happi|ne&s;s &s;uch envied di&s;tinctions nece&s;&s;arily confer.</P>
<P>I &s;hall take it for granted, that a good e&s;tabli&s;h|ment in marriage is the object of mo&s;t women's wi&s;hes. It has been computed that nineteen mar|riages in twenty, among per&s;ons of liberal condi|tion, are concluded upon no great inequality of circum&s;tances. It is plain then, that a lady who flatters her&s;elf, that &s;he &s;hall marry above her rank, runs no le&s;s a risk that twenty to one of a di&s;ap|pointment. In fact this is unavoidable; for per|&s;ons of rank and opulence are not very numerous, and frequently intermarry with each other: yet upon &s;o &s;lender a pro&s;pect has many a poor lady tired both her&s;elf and the public with a repetition of her countenance for many years pa&s;t at every place of amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>To the&s;e dazzling and delu&s;ive hopes are ea&s;e and contentment often &s;acrificed, from a mi&s;taken
<PB N="184" REF="197">
opinion that grandeur and happine&s;s are in&s;epa|rable; or rather, that the latter was not po&s;&s;ible without the former: hence anxious days and &s;leep|le&s;s nights, not to mention that virtue is much en|dangered by pur&s;uits giddy and fanta&s;tical. After years of vain expectation the point in view is at a greater di&s;tance than ever, to obtain which dancing-ma&s;ters and milliners have a&s;&s;i&s;ted in vain. If it be &s;aid, that we hear &s;ometimes of ladies, who from private &s;tations have ro&s;e to great rank and riches, I an&s;wer, that particular exceptions conclude nothing again&s;t the general ob&s;ervation, that unrea&s;onable expectation mu&s;t almo&s;t always be di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>In&s;tances of &s;urpri&s;ing good fortune happen in all pur&s;uits, and &s;eeming accident will have its &s;hare in the happy events of matrimony, as well as in mo&s;t others. But if young people inflame their imaginations with extraordinary occurrences, and &s;oar upon the waxen wings of expectation to re|gions of imaginary bli&s;s, they will quickly find, like Icarus, misfortune interrupting the dream of vanity, and may po&s;&s;ibly pay almo&s;t as dear for the experiment.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the ble&s;&s;ings of Providence, we rather lament the ab&s;ence of things perhaps not nece&s;&s;ary, than make a proper u&s;e of tho&s;e we have. It &s;ufficiently appears, that a pa&s;&s;ion for grandeur is not likely to be gratified; and that &s;uch wi&s;hes mu&s;t, in the nature of things, much oftener mi&s;|carry than &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>But for once let us &s;uppe&s;e the point obtained, and examine what happine&s;s is annexed to that en|vied condition. Providence, for the wi&s;e&s;t rea&s;ons,
<PB N="185" REF="198">
has made a great difference in the external circum|&s;tances of his creatures, but not in their happine&s;s. In fact, the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings of life are propo&s;ed in common to us all. Health and an approving con&s;cience are the grand &s;atisfactions of our being, as &s;in and pain are almo&s;t the only evils: nor can we cea&s;e to adore that goodne&s;s who has made the be&s;t things in life attainable by all conditions, with|out a po&s;&s;ibility of interfering with each other. In the&s;e two grand articles, it appears, that per&s;ons of wealth and &s;tation have no advantage over more moderate conditions. The former are more expo&s;ed to temptations, and a full tide of pro&s;perity has been always reckoned dangerous to virtue.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, tho&s;e who have large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and connexions are much broader marks for misfortune than others. Socrates accounted tho&s;e happie&s;t who had fewe&s;t wants, as the happie&s;t of all beings is he who wants nothing. The more our wants are enlarged, and our appetites indulged, they be|come more ungovernable, and exceed our powers of &s;atisfying them. Such per&s;ons are expo&s;ed to perpetual di&s;appointment, as it is much ea&s;ier to imagine than obtain.</P>
<P>How many per&s;ons may we not pre&s;ume, who are &s;hining them&s;elves, and &s;hone on by fortune, that are inwardly mi&s;erable, and &s;ick of life? Wealth and &s;tation may indeed procure a great variety of &s;en&s;ual gratifications, out of the reach of humbler fortunes: but of what nature are &s;uch plea&s;ures? fleeting and di&s;&s;atisfactory in the confe&s;&s;ion of all.</P>
<P>Let us reflect a little on the mo&s;t exalted plea|&s;ures our nature is capable of. We &s;hall find them
<PB N="186" REF="199">
attainable by private &s;tations, and from &s;ome of the be&s;t of them the very lowe&s;t conditions not ex|cluded. Even tho&s;e who are condemned to the drudgery of manual labour may, and do often en|joy a healthful body and a tranquil mind. Though they are in a great mea&s;ure excluded from in|tellectual enjoyments, yet even this view of their condition is not without its compen&s;ations. It will not be denied, that our be&s;t enjoyments here below ari&s;e from temperance, moderate de&s;ires, ea&s;y re|flexions, and a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of knowledge and vir|tue. I would a&s;k my fair countrywomen, whether high rank and great riches are nece&s;&s;ary to the&s;e at|tainments? The pure&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial plea|&s;ures are certainly tho&s;e ari&s;ing from religion and virtue; the plea&s;ures of knowledge, and of friend|&s;hip: which are attainable by the middling, if not all cla&s;&s;es of life, depend much upon our&s;elves, and are little &s;ubject to accident or diminution. So far from being the con&s;tant companions of rank and riches, that perhaps they are &s;eldomer found a|mong per&s;ons of elevated &s;tations than mo&s;t others. It were ea&s;y to a&s;&s;ign the rea&s;ons; as the nece&s;&s;aries of life are not difficult to obtain, &s;o neither are its be&s;t comforts. A per&s;on mu&s;t have reflected in|deed to very little purpo&s;e who is not &s;en&s;ible, that the pro&s;pect of the divine favour in another life, is the grand foundation of contentment in this im|perfect and probationary &s;tate.</P>
<P>It will be &s;aid, that a competency of the good things of life, is nece&s;&s;ary to our happine&s;s, and truly de&s;irable. Mo&s;t undoubtedly it is: but the misfortune is, our ideas of a competency are not
<PB N="187" REF="200">
taken from nature, or even from our proper &s;ta|tion and character, but from our imaginations and wrong habits; and what is yet more prepo&s;terous, from our compari&s;ons with others.</P>
<P>A competency is not to be defined, becau&s;e it varies according to the &s;tation and nece&s;&s;ities of in|dividuals. To u&s;e a familiar compari&s;on&mdash;Sup|po&s;e a per&s;on undertakes a journey into a remote country, and has &s;ufficient to defray his nece&s;&s;ary expences, may he not enjoy the true plea&s;ures of the &s;cene equally with him who travels the &s;ame journey, attended with all the parade of equipage, and encumbered with a &s;uperfluity of wealth? May not as &s;ucce&s;sful a voyage be made in a &s;mall, con|venient bark, as in a galley no le&s;s &s;plendid than Cleopatra's?</P>
<P>Let nothing here advanced be &s;uppo&s;ed to mean, that wealth and &s;tation incapacitate their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors from enjoying the true&s;t happine&s;s of their na|ture. Among other advantages in common with their fellow-creatures, they eminently enjoy the godlike power of doing good to others. It is the exerci&s;e of that power that gives rank and riches their true dignity, and is the con&s;tant employment of him who is the &s;ource of all excellence. But let not people mi&s;take that which may be made the means of happine&s;s for the nece&s;&s;ary and never fail|ing cau&s;e of it; nor repine at the want of tho&s;e di&s;tinctions in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which there occur &s;o many examples extremely mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude this letter without ob&s;erving, that an appetite for grandeur very fatally predo|minates at a cri&s;is in life, wherein, of all others,
<PB N="188" REF="201">
it behoves us to act with the true&s;t wi&s;dom: I mean at the time of marriage. Matches are now deemed good or bad, not from the qualities, but the external circum&s;tances of the parties. The opinion of Themi&s;tocles, like many other old opi|nions, is quite exploded, who declared,
<Q>That he would rather marry his daughter to a man with|out an e&s;tate, than to an e&s;tate without a man.</Q></P>
<P>The candidates for the ladies affections, or more properly their fortunes, undergo the mo&s;t exact &s;crutiny into their e&s;tates, expectations, and al|liances; nor is any enquiry omitted, but into their &s;en&s;e and morals. If your fair readers plea&s;e to ex|tend this charge to their admirers, they have my con&s;ent, only remembering, that folly on one &s;ide, never excu&s;es it on another; and that they are mo&s;t likely to be greater &s;ufferers by an ill choice, as their condition is more dependent.</P>
<P>It is agreed on all &s;ides, that the &s;ure &s;upports of conjugal felicity are the unre&s;erved friend&s;hip and mutual e&s;teem of the parties: now it is an axiom, that friend&s;hip cannot exi&s;t but between virtuous minds; and &s;urely no dreams of a lunatic were ever more vi&s;ionary, than to &s;uppo&s;e there can be any abiding plea&s;ure without virtue, &s;ince in our &s;y&s;tem of being there is nothing durable but the con&s;equences of it.</P>
<P>Many a thoughtle&s;s female, who de&s;pi&s;ed all con|&s;iderations but rank and riches, &s;erves only to ex|hibit a wretched &s;pectacle of their in&s;ufficiency. I doubt not but this e&s;&s;ay may fall into the hands of &s;ome of your fair readers, who have dragged out an in&s;ipid length of days, doating about vain and
<PB N="189" REF="202">
peri&s;hable di&s;tinctions, and have &s;unk into utter contempt and oblivion, who, by a better conduct, might have enjoyed happy and comfortable e&s;ta|bli&s;hments.</P>
<P>Let tho&s;e who&s;e ca&s;es are retrievable, con&s;ider that elevation mu&s;t ever be the lot of very few; nor when it is attained does it invariably produce happine&s;s. The true&s;t &s;atisfactions in life are not nece&s;&s;arily connected with great e&s;tates or coronets, but are to be found among per&s;ons of all condi|tions, who&s;e lives are governed by &s;en&s;e and virtue. Of one thing they may be infallibly certain, that a life conducted by vanity cannot fail to end in mi&s;ery.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE COUNT DE COMMINGE CONTINUED.</HEAD>
<P>HEaring her &s;peak with unu&s;ual emotion, I ap|proach'd her: &s;he was giving her mother an ac|count of what had happened. Madame de Lu&s;&s;an was as much offended at the chevalier's behaviour as her daughter. I was &s;ilent: I even continued my walk with the ladies. When they retired, I &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the chevalier: he was at home, and in con&s;equence of my de&s;iring him to meet me, he came in&s;tantly to the place appointed.</P>
<P><Q>I cannot per&s;uade my&s;elf, &s;aid I, approach|ing him, that what has happened during our walk to-day, is more than a mere plea&s;antry: you are too gallant and well bred, to keep a la|dy's picture, contrary to her inclination.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I know not, an&s;wered he warmly, what in|tere&s;t you take in my keeping or re&s;toring it; but I know that I neither need, nor will accept of your advice.</Q>
<Q>Then, replied I, clapping my hand to my &s;word, I will force you to re|ceive it in this manner.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="204">The chevalier was brave. He eagerly an&s;wered my defiance: we fought for &s;ome time with equal &s;ucce&s;s; but he was not animated like me with the de&s;ire of &s;erving what I loved. He wounded me &s;lightly in two places; but I gave him two large wounds, and obliged him both to a&s;k his life, and to re&s;ign the picture. After I had a&s;&s;i&s;ted him to ri&s;e, and had conducted him to the neare&s;t hou&s;e, I retired to my own lodgings, where as &s;oon as the wounds I had received were dre&s;t, I &s;et my&s;elf to contemplate the lovely picture, and ki&s;&s;ed it a thou|&s;and and a thou&s;and times.</P>
<P>I had a genius for painting, which I had taken &s;ome pains to cultivate; yet I was far from being a ma&s;ter in the art: but what will not love accom|pli&s;h? I undertook to copy this portrait. I &s;pent two days in this employment. Delightful ta&s;k! I &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that even a very di&s;cerning eye might have mi&s;taken mine for the original. This in|&s;pired me with the thought of &s;ub&s;tituting one for the other, by which contrivance I &s;hould have the advantage of keeping that which belonged to Ade|laida; and &s;he, without knowing it, would always bear my work about her.</P>
<P>The&s;e trifles to one who truly loves are matters of great importance, and my heart knew how to &s;et a full value on them.</P>
<P>After I had fa&s;tened the picture I had painted to the riband in &s;uch a manner that my cheat could not be di&s;covered, I pre&s;ented it to Adelaida. Ma|dame de Lu&s;&s;an expre&s;s'd her&s;elf highly obliged to me. Adelaida &s;aid little: &s;he &s;eemed embarra&s;&s;ed; but in the mid&s;t of that embara&s;&s;ment, I thought I

di&s;covered that &s;he was plea&s;ed at having received this little obligation from me, and that thought gave me real tran&s;port.</P>
<P>I have in my life experienced &s;ome of tho&s;e happy moments; and had my misfortunes been only common ones, I &s;houd not have believed them too dearly purcha&s;ed.</P>
<P>After this little adventure, I &s;tood extremely well in the e&s;teem of Madame de Lu&s;&s;an. I was always at her lodgings: I &s;aw Adelaida every hour in the day; and although I did not &s;peak to her of my pa&s;&s;ion, yet I was &s;ure &s;he knew it, and I had rea&s;on to believe &s;he did not hate me. Hearts as &s;en&s;ible as ours were, quickly under&s;tand each other: to them every thing is expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I had lived two months in this manner, when I received a letter from my father, in which he com|manded me to return immediately. This com|mand was to me like the &s;troke of a thunder-bolt: my whole &s;oul had been engro&s;&s;ed with the plea|&s;ure of &s;eeing and loving Adelaida.

AN ESSAY ON THE Original Inhabitants of GREAT BRITAIN.</HEAD>
<P>THE hi&s;tory of every nation in the world begins in a dark and fabulous manner: nor can any hi&s;tory be more ob&s;cure than that of Great Britain. It is impo&s;&s;ible to gue&s;s when, or by whom our i&s;land was originally peopled. The conjectures on this head have been various; but as they amount only to conjectures, and as the point it&s;elf is of no real importance, I &s;hall pa&s;s di|rectly forward to the fir&s;t accounts upon which we may place any reliance. The original inhabi|tants are repre&s;ented as con&s;i&s;ting of two cla&s;|&s;es, Prie&s;ts and Soldiers. The whole i&s;land, at lea&s;t that part of it called South Britain, was divided into &s;mall provinces, each of which was allotted to the &s;overeignty of a prince. The&s;e princes lived in con&s;tant warfare and contention. The prie&s;ts were di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Druids; but their power was not only confined to the ceremo|nies of &s;acrifice, and other religious parts of wor|&s;hip, it extended to the government of all civil judicature. To the ordinary druids, (who were
<PB N="194" REF="208">
very numerous, but &s;eldom or ever of mean birth) was committed the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice in the &s;everal provinces, the determination of all cau&s;es, and the judicial deci&s;ion of right and wrong; but &s;till &s;ubject to the &s;upreme juri&s;diction of one chief druid, who, in dignity, excelled all the re&s;t; and who, in civil affairs, had the power of a king, while in religious matters, he might be called the reigning Pope of tho&s;e days.</P>
<P>The military men were brave, even to a degree of fiercene&s;s. They had never felt the effects of fear, fatigue, or luxury. They had been bred in woods, and inured to hard&s;hips. Agriculture and merchandize had made little or no progre&s;s in the kingdom. The con&s;tant diet of the people was milk and fle&s;h-meat, of both which they had great plenty, the whole i&s;land being filled with various kinds of cattle.</P>
<P>Such were the Britons, when Julius Cae&s;ar in|vaded their country. He appeared, with his fleet, hovering upon the coa&s;t of England, Augu&s;t the twenty-&s;ixth, in the year of Rome, 699, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some authors place the inva&s;ion in the year 698, par|ticularly Lydiat in his <HI>&s;eries &s;ummorum magi&s;tratum Romanorum</HI> Let the learned chronologi&s;ts &s;ettle the point.</NOTE> fifty-four or fifty-five years before the birth of Chri&s;t. His pretence for this inva&s;ion was the con&s;tant refuge which the Belgae, a people of Gaul, had received from the inhabitants of Britain, and the perpetual &s;uccours and a&s;&s;i&s;tance which were granted by the Britains to the enemies of Rome. The pre|tence was &s;pecious. The true motive was a thir&s;t of
<PB N="195" REF="209">
glory. Cae&s;ar's ambition like the ocean he cro&s;t, had no bounds.</P>
<P>I am inclined to think, that this enterprize was not very acceptable to the Roman people: they looked upon it as an hazardous undertaking. Cicero, in one of his epi&s;tles to Atticus, expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf thus: <HI>Britannici belli exitus expectatur: con&s;tat enim aditus in&s;ulae e&s;&s;e munitos mirificis molibus: etium illud jam cognitum e&s;t, neque argenti &s;cripulum e&s;&s;e illum in illa in&s;ul&acirc;, neque ullam &s;pem praedae, ni&s;i ex mancipiis: ex quibus nullos puto te literis aut mu|&s;icis eruditos ex&s;pectare.</HI>
<Q>The event of the Bri|ti&s;h war is waited for with impatience. It is certain, that all the approaches to that i&s;land are fortified by amazing out-works: and it is univer&s;ally known, that not a &s;cruple of &s;ilver is to be found throughout the whole i&s;land; nor are there hopes of any acqui&s;itions except the &s;laves, among&s;t whom I cannot &s;uppo&s;e you will expect mu&s;icians, or men of learning.</Q>
Tully, we perceive, &s;eems to treat the Britains rather in a &s;neering manner, than to &s;peak of them with his u&s;ual, lively, but weighty manner of expre&s;&s;ion. He has no great opinion of their genius, or of their learning. But however illiterate, or however un|&s;killed in mu&s;ic our ance&s;tors might appear, it can|not be denied, that they were not only couragious, but of a liberal nature, totally devoid of all low art, but not totally unver&s;ed in the policy of war. Cae&s;ar gives an account of them, which as it comes from an enemy is very much to their honour. He &s;ays, he had great difficulty in landing, being an|noyed by their darts, and oppo&s;ed by their cavalry;
<PB N="196" REF="210">
and when he had brought his troops to an engage|ment, he confe&s;&s;es, that the battle was maintained with &s;harpne&s;s on both &s;ides. <HI>Pugnatum e&s;t ab utri&s;que acriter.</HI> At length the Roman arms pre|vailed. The i&s;landers gave way, retired to their woods, and immediately &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to &s;ue for terms of peace. Cae&s;ar, upon the arrival of the amba&s;&s;adors reproached the Britons, as having acted ungenerou&s;ly, by impri&s;oning his friend Comius, whom he had &s;ent into England, &s;ome time before, with his own particular commands. Their excu&s;e is remarkable. <HI>Ejus rei culpam in multitudinem contulerunt, et propter imprudentiam ut igno&s;ceretur petiverunt.</HI>
<Q>They acknowledged their imprudence, begged that it might be forgiven, and fixed the ra&s;hne&s;s of the action entirely upon the common people.</Q>
So powerful and un|governable, even at that time, was an Engli&s;h rab|ble. Cae&s;ar, gentle and compa&s;&s;ionate, both by nature and policy, received the excu&s;e, demanded ho&s;tages, and granted terms of peace.</P>
<P>The peace on the &s;ide of the Britons was an act of nece&s;&s;ity, not of choice. Perhaps is was no le&s;s &s;o on the &s;ide of the Romans. They would have penetrated farther into the i&s;land; they would have vi&s;ited the coa&s;ts and would have con&s;idered the various parts that might have afforded them a refuge in any future inva&s;ion, if they had not met with a people very different from what they ex|pected. They expected wild &s;avages, they met with real &s;oldiers. They had been u&s;ed to &s;trike terror upon the continent, they only excited &s;pirit and unanimity in a little i&s;land, where they found
<PB N="197" REF="211">
courage in&s;tead of fear; and order in&s;tead of con|fu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Cae&s;ar, at his fir&s;t expedition from Belgic Gaul into Britain, had left his cavalry behind him. They were detained by contrary winds in a port at &s;ome di&s;tance from that where he had embarked: He had given orders that they &s;hould follow, on the earlie&s;t opportunity, loaded with arms, ammu|nition, and &s;oldiers: and four days after his arrival in England, they had obeyed tho&s;e orders, and were more than half way over the Briti&s;h channel, when a &s;udden &s;torm turned the &s;hips entirely out of their cour&s;e, and not only forced back many of them to the continent, but drove others to the mo&s;t we&s;tern part of the i&s;land. At the &s;ame time, the ve&s;&s;els which had tran&s;ported Cae&s;ar, and which had remained at anchor upon the Briti&s;h coa&s;t, were much &s;hattered by the tempe&s;t. Twelve of them were ab&s;olutely lo&s;t; and the Romans &s;aw them&s;elves at once deprived of all hopes of pro|vi&s;ion, except &s;uch as could be procured from the i&s;landers, by &s;ending out parties to forage at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the Roman camp.</P>
<P>From the&s;e unexpected circum&s;tances, the Bri|tons re&s;olved to reap advantage: they a&s;&s;embled their di&s;banded troops with great privacy and ex|pedition, and while one of the Roman legions was &s;ent out to forage, they &s;uddenly &s;urrounded the foragers, and mu&s;t immediately have de&s;troyed the re&s;t, if Cae&s;ar with amazing alacrity had not ha&s;tened to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The &s;udden appear|ance of Cae&s;ar, although attended only by two co|horts, put the Britons to a &s;tand; and the Romans
<PB N="198" REF="212">
did not think them&s;elves, at that time, &s;ufficiently prepared for an engagement. Each party retired; the Britons to the woods, the Romans to their camp.</P>
<P>Here the Britons &s;eem to have been defective in military conduct. They ought to have pur&s;ued their blow: they ought to have attacked Cae&s;ar; and in the true &s;pirit of liberty, they ought either to have conquered, or to have died. It is proba|ble that they perceived their error, and it is po&s;|&s;ible, they might have retrieved it, if a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of rain and &s;torms for many days together, had not rendered all efforts again&s;t the enemy imprac|ticable.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the weather changed, the Britons came out of their retirement, and marched to attack the Romans in their trenches. Cae&s;ar drew out his legions before the camp; both armies engaged, and both fought with equal &s;pirit and re&s;olution; but the Romans were better di&s;ciplined, and more perfect ma&s;ters of the art of war: &s;o that the un|happy Britons were routed, and again compelled to &s;ue for peace, from the hands of an invader, who, although the greate&s;t man that ever lived, mu&s;t ever appear as lawle&s;s a tyrant to Britain as to Rome. Cae&s;ar was not &s;orry to be &s;ollicited for terms of peace: he received the amba&s;&s;adors in his u&s;ual attractive manner, and lo&s;t no time in &s;etling the terms of accommodation. He in&s;i&s;ted upon a greater number of ho&s;tages than he had before required; and, under pretence of avoiding the &s;torms that generally rage in the Briti&s;h &s;eas at
<PB N="199" REF="213">
the autumnal equinox, he embarked his troops, and ha&s;tened back to Gaul.</P>
<P>Cae&s;ar, during his &s;hort re&s;idence in Britain, had ob&s;erved enough of this new world, to make him tacitly re&s;olve upon a &s;econd inva&s;ion. The woods were large, the cattle numerous, and the inhabitants a brave people, worthy of being con|quered.</P>
<P>A finer object could not have pre&s;ented it&s;elf to the eye of ambition. However, Cae&s;ar pa&s;&s;ed his winter as u&s;ual in Italy, without any open decla|ration of returning into England. In the mean time, the Britons, filled with anger, indignation, and di&s;appointment, and perhaps guided by the dictates of pride, revenge, and ob&s;tinacy, were de|termined not to &s;end the ho&s;tages, which had been peremptorily required on one &s;ide, and had been faith|fully promi&s;ed on the other. Cae&s;ar let &s;ome months pa&s;s before he took notice of &s;o notorious a breach of faith; and in this particular he acted with all the &s;ubtilty of a mi&s;er, who, when he has obtained a morgage upon an e&s;tate, purpo&s;ely &s;uffers the in|tere&s;t of it to run on, till he can claim a right of &s;eizing the premi&s;es, and defying all equity of redemption.</P>
<P>In the year of Rome 700, Cae&s;ar, who, during the winter, had been making various preparations for a &s;econd attempt upon England, put his de&s;ign into execution. He &s;et &s;ail late in the eveing from the Portus Itius <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Portus Itius was near Bologne. The particular &s;pot is pointed out, but with no ab&s;olute certainty.</NOTE>, and arrived the next
<PB N="200" REF="214">
day <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cae&s;ar, in his Commentaries, has not told us the exact month of his embarkation; but we may be certain, that it was earlier in the &s;ummer than his fir&s;t inva&s;ion.</NOTE> about noon upon the Briti&s;h coa&s;t. His army con&s;i&s;ted of two thou&s;and hor&s;e, and five le|gions <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A legion con&s;i&s;ted of ten companies, or cohorts. The number of men were uncertain: &s;ometimes more, &s;ometimes le&s;s.</NOTE> of foot; and his &s;hips, including tran&s;ports and every other &s;ort, amounted to above eight hundred. Such a number of ve&s;&s;els appearing at once upon the ocean, was a terrifying circum&s;tance to the Britons: they imagined Cae&s;ar's military forces much more numerous than they really were; and they immediately withdrew their troops from the &s;hore, and retired into a more covered part of the country; &s;o that Cae&s;ar landed his men, and fixed his camp without the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition. His fir&s;t enquiry was, into what part of the i&s;land the Britons had withdrawn; and having learnt their particular &s;ituation, he left a &s;ufficient number of forces to guard his fleet, and proceeded with the re&s;t in pur&s;uit of the enemy. The i&s;landers had expected his approach, and were prepared to re|ceive him, by having fixed them&s;elves upon a ri|&s;ing-ground near a river, at the di&s;tance of about twelve miles from the &s;hore. Here they en|deavoured to oppo&s;e him by their chariots <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cae&s;ar very particularly de&s;cribes their manner of fight|ing, (<HI>ex e&s;&s;edis</HI>) from their chariots: and &s;ays, that by con|tinual u&s;e they were arrived at &s;uch perfection in the manage|ment of tho&s;e vehicles, that they could &s;top their hor&s;es even upon a &s;teep de&s;cent: they could run upon the pole, and throw them&s;elves out, or into their chariots, with the utmo&s;t nimblene&s;s. Cae&s;ar confe&s;&s;es, that at the fir&s;t &s;ight of this new method of fighting, the Romans were &s;urpri&s;ed, or rather a&s;toni&s;hed.</NOTE> and their cavalry; but in vain. The Roman hor&s;e
<PB N="201" REF="215">
prevailed, and the Britons again withdrew to their woods. They were there fortified, as Cae&s;ar tells us, both by art and nature. The woods were very thick, and the pa&s;&s;age into them was rendered extremely difficult, by large trees, which had been cut down, and heaped upon each other to a great height. The Britons had made u&s;e of this method of fortification, in their civil wars: but the Romans &s;oon made their way over the&s;e entrenchments, and expelled the Britons even from the woods, where they had taken &s;helter. A &s;mall number of regular troops will infallibly conquer a much larger number of undi&s;ciplined forces. The Roman army con&s;i&s;ted of veterans, who had been trained up from their youth in the art of war; and had carried their arms over the greate&s;t part of the world. The Britons had only practi&s;ed the military &s;cience within their own i&s;land, and in conte&s;ts again&s;t each other. They were equal in courage, but inferior in &s;kill to their enemies. In &s;ome mea&s;ure to re|medy this defect, they enli&s;ted them&s;elves under the greate&s;t commander of tho&s;e days, Ca&s;&s;ive|launus, prince or &s;overeign of the Ca&s;&s;i, and the Trinobantes. The Trinobantian territories <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The territories of Ca&s;&s;ivellaunus were exten&s;ive: they ex|tended, &s;ays Cae&s;ar, "Four&s;core miles into the i&s;land." Ca&s;|&s;ivellaunus was originally the king of the Ca&s;&s;i, and became &s;o|vereign of the Trinobantes, by treacherou&s;ly &s;laying their king Imanuentius.</NOTE>, were

Hertford&s;hire, E&s;&s;ex, and a great part of Middle|&s;ex. The municipal city of this colony, was <HI>Veru|lanum,</HI> Verulam, the walls of which, built probably in the time of Agricola, are &s;till to be &s;een in the approaches to St. Alban's.</P>
<P>Several &s;kirmi&s;hes pa&s;&s;ed between the Britons and the Romans; in one of which the former gained &s;ome &s;mall advantage. But what force could repel Cae&s;ar? He &s;till marched forward towards the river Thames, re&s;olving to cro&s;s it at the only place where it was fordable. Ca&s;&s;ivelaunus had fore&s;een his de&s;ign, and had drawn up a large body of Briti&s;h troops on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore. He had fortified the banks with pali&s;ades, and had driven into the bottom of the river a great number of &s;harp &s;takes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A little above Walton in Surry. The tran&s;lator of Rapin &s;ays, that the&s;e &s;takes are now to be &s;een in the river at low water; and one of them was pulled up, with great difficulty, &s;ome years ago. They are of oak, and by having lain &s;o long in the water (above eighteen centuries) are become very hard and very black.</NOTE> who&s;e tops were covered by the water. He had u&s;ed every precaution that courage, &s;agacity, and pre&s;ence of mind could &s;ugge&s;t; but the Romans were determined not to be re|pul&s;ed. Their cavalry fir&s;t entered the river, the legions immediately followed, and notwith&s;tanding all impediments, pa&s;&s;ed acro&s;s the Thames, with &s;uch expedition, and approached the enemy with &s;o much vigour, that the Britons, unable to &s;u&s;tain the a&s;&s;ault, quitted the banks of the river, and fled farther into the country.</P>
<P>Ca&s;&s;ivelaunus &s;till continued to make &s;ome at|tempts again&s;t the Romans; but his de&s;igns con|&s;tantly
<PB N="203" REF="217">
proved abortive. The repeated victories of Cae&s;ar, the inte&s;tine broils of the kingdom, the immediate pre&s;ence of a powerful invader, were all circum&s;tances that tended to damp the &s;pirits of an unexperienced, and a di&s;united people. Many of the principalities (for &s;o I think we may call the &s;everal Di&s;tricts of the i&s;land) began to entertain thoughts of &s;uing for an accommodation with Cae&s;ar. The Trinobantes &s;et the example: they offered to &s;ubmit to the conqueror, and to give them&s;elves up to his di&s;po&s;al: at the &s;ame time reque&s;ting, that he would deliver them from the tyranny of Ca&s;&s;ivelaunus, and a&s;&s;ign the go|vernment, of their colony to Mandubratius, the &s;on of Imanuentius their late king.</P>
<P>Cae&s;ar, ever fond of &s;hewing acts of mercy and benevolence, accepted their offers and granted their reque&s;t <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mandubratius, upon the death of his father, had fled into Gaul to Cae&s;ar, who received him with great kindne&s;s.</NOTE>. The example of the Trinobantes was &s;oon followed by &s;everal of the other colonies, and the unfortunate Ca&s;&s;ivelaunus found him&s;elf de&s;erted on every &s;ide. His capital, a capital in|deed of huts and hovels, was taken, plundered, and de&s;troyed. What &s;tep was left then for this un|happy prince? only an ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the conqueror. A true Briton is always unwilling to &s;ubmit, and Ca&s;&s;ivelaunus deferred his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the late&s;t hour: however, as he was a man of &s;en&s;e, as well as a man of &s;pirit, and as all the in|ferior generals <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Principes.</NOTE> were undermining him by ma|king terms for them&s;elves, he re&s;olved to put an
<PB N="204" REF="218">
end to a di&s;advantageous war, and to &s;end am|ba&s;&s;adors to the enemy, with offers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ca&s;&s;ivelaunus having been appointed in a &s;olemn a&s;&s;em|bly of the Briti&s;h princes, the captain general in chief, or the Agamemnon of the Engli&s;h forces, he was empowered to make &s;uch offers as he thought proper, in the name of him|&s;elf, and of the whole people of Britain.</NOTE> of a &s;urrender. Julius Cae&s;ar received them like Julius Cae&s;ar. He exerted no acts of tyranny by the victorious progre&s;s of his arms; he impo&s;ed no hard terms of accommodation: but he required, in the &s;tyle of a conqueror, the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances from Ca&s;|&s;ivelaunus, of never attempting any injuries towards Mandubratius, or the Trinobantes. He received ho&s;tages for the performance of this contract; and he extracted a &s;mall annual tribute, to be paid by the &s;tates of Britain to the Roman people. After the&s;e tran&s;actions, he took the advantage of a calm &s;ea&s;on, and &s;ailed back with his army into Gaul.</P>
<P>The character of Ca&s;&s;ivelaunus, as a general, mu&s;t always &s;hine with great lu&s;tre in the Engli&s;h annals. <HI>Si pergama dextra defendi po&s;&s;ent etiam hac defen&s;a fui&s;&s;ent.</HI>
<Q>If Britons could have been defended, &s;uch a right hand had defended them.</Q>
But his behaviour to the Trinobantes appears by their complaints to Cae&s;ar, to have been tyrannical: and his murder of Imanuentius carries with it all the marks of a &s;avage barbarity. Yet perhaps in the &s;eizure of the Trinobantian colony he was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the inha|bitants them&s;elves; for I am apt to imagine, that even in tho&s;e early days, the Britons were fond of making and unmaking kings.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="219">Till Cae&s;ar's death, which was in the year of Rome 711, the Britons remained unmole&s;ted by inva|&s;ions, but &s;till tributary to the Roman people. The murderer of the mighty Julius was attended by all the violence and di&s;traction of civil war; and the Romans were for &s;ome years too inten&s;ely employed upon the continent to turn their thoughts towards a di&s;tant we&s;tern i&s;land, that at that time appeared of little con&s;equence to the &s;outhern part of the world.</P>
<P>During this interval, it is not improbable that the Britons made &s;ome improvements in their man|ners, and &s;ome advantages in their trade. Julius Cae&s;ar de&s;cribes the inhabitants of the &s;ea-coa&s;ts, tho&s;e coa&s;ts that were neare&s;t to Gaul, as a mixture of the Belgae and the Britons. The people who were &s;ituated beyond the Thames, and in the mo&s;t inland parts of the i&s;land, con&s;i&s;ted, he &s;ays, en|tirely of natives. The&s;e, indeed, he repre&s;ents in general as men, who had &s;carce any preten&s;ions to the dignity of human nature, except the figure.</P>
<P>Let us therefore remember that the Romans owed their origin to thieves and vagabonds; and that Great Britain owes her glory to &s;avages and wild men. The heralds mu&s;t decide which of the two &s;ets of Aborigines are entitled to the more-dignified coat of arms.</P>
<P>During the reign of Augu&s;tus the Britons re|mained entirely unmole&s;ted by the Romans. The i&s;land was looked upon as a kingdom that had rather added per&s;onal fame to Julius Cae&s;ar than remarkable advantage to the empire of Rome. Augu&s;tus was in no degree equal to his uncle in
<PB N="206" REF="220">
like enterpri&s;ing genius: however, he had formed a de&s;ign of vi&s;iting Britain <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Serves iterum Cae&s;arum in ultimos,</L>

<P>Tiberius followed the example of his predece&s;|&s;or, and made no attempt upon the i&s;land. Cor|nelius Tacitus, &s;peaking of this behaviour towards the Britons, &s;ays, <HI>Con&s;ilium id divus Augu&s;tus vocabat, Tiberius praeceptum</HI>
<Q>This conduct Augu&s;tus called policy: the example of Augu&s;tus, was a precept to Tiberius.</Q></P>
<P>The temper of Caligula, the next Roman em|peror, differed in a great mea&s;ure from the peace|ful &s;tupidity of Tiberius. Caligula was vain, im|petuous, and extravagant; but cowardly, pa&s;&s;ive, and irre&s;olute. He a&s;&s;embled an army of two hundred thou&s;and men, pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine, repa&s;&s;ed it, without &s;eeing an enemy; plundered Gaul, came to the gallic &s;hore, proclaimed war again&s;t Britain, and gathered cockle &s;hells.</P>
<P>To Claudius the fifth emperor of Rome fate had re&s;erved a more complete conque&s;t of our i&s;land than had been made by any of his predece&s;&s;ors. The Bri|tons had ju&s;tly ridiculed the military fopperies of Caligula; but they carried their exultations too far. They imagined them&s;elves invincible, becau&s;e a Roman emperor and his numerous army had pompou&s;ly marched to the &s;ea-&s;hore, and were
<PB N="207" REF="221">
afraid to cro&s;s the ocean. Our ance&s;tors remained wrapt up in this kind of &s;ecurity, at the acce&s;&s;ion of Claudius, who&s;e per&s;onal character could not po&s;&s;ibly give the lea&s;t room for apprehen&s;ion. He was as indolent as Tiberius, and as cowardly as Caligula; but his lucky &s;tars ordained him to be governed by coun&s;ellors of far &s;uperior judg|ment to his own. Among the&s;e were Aulus Plautius, and O&s;torius Scapula, both men of great eminence in rank and reputation. To the fir&s;t, was a&s;&s;igned the command of the army de&s;tined again&s;t the Britons.</P>
<P>It is an ob&s;ervation made by Julius Cae&s;ar, that the Belgic Britons, and the native or an|tient Britons, were very different in their cu&s;toms and manners. A con&s;tant intercour&s;e with the continent, &s;ome progre&s;s in agriculture, and a con&s;iderable increa&s;e of commerce, had, in a great mea&s;ure, poli&s;hed, and improved the for|mer, whil&s;t the latter remained in their original fiercene&s;s.</P>
<P>We cannot wonder that men of &s;uch a di&s;&s;imilar turn of mind and actions, &s;hould be continually jarring with each other. The former, like cour|tiers, were too &s;ervilely &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to tempting circum&s;tances, and alluring views of ambition; the latter, like country gentlemen, were too ob&s;ti|nately re&s;olute, and too impoliticly re&s;erved. The&s;e di&s;&s;entions proved of great u&s;e to an invader, and Plautius landed, without the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition. He found the i&s;land like a de&s;ert; &s;carce an inhabi|tant appeared. The Belgic Britons had retired into woods and fortre&s;&s;es: they ha&s;tened to retreat
<PB N="208" REF="222">
from an enemy with whom they were unprepared to engage. Plautius moved onward, with his army coa&s;ting along the Thames, till he came to Wal|lingford, where he cro&s;&s;ed the river, and entered into the territories of the Donubi, a colony to whom Oxford&s;hire, and a great part of Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, belonged. The&s;e were the fir&s;t people from whom he met with re&s;i&s;tance. They fought again&s;t the Romans with great bravery; but being unfortu|nate in four &s;ucce&s;&s;ive battles, and in the lo&s;s of one of their chieftains, Togodumus, they retreated acro&s;s the Thames, and were followed by Plautius. Both armies encamped on the &s;ide of the river, next to Gaul; but our hi&s;torians, I think, have not ex|actly fixed their &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The Roman General remained in his camp, and evidently declined an engagement. The Donubi, although four times vanqui&s;hed, and &s;till in a &s;tate of exile from their own colony, attributed his con|duct to fear: but they were mi&s;taken in their judgment. The inactivity of Plautius was nei|ther the effect of fear nor caution: he waited for the arrival of the emperor; and, from a noblene&s;s of &s;oul, uncommon in a general, intended to crown his imperial ma&s;ter with all the laurels and honours that might ari&s;e from any future conque&s;t over the Britons.</P>
<P>Claudius landed at the Portes Rutupinus (Sand|wich in Kent) and marched with his troops to the mouth of the river Thames, where Plautius was encamped. As &s;oon as the Roman forces were all joined, they repa&s;&s;ed the Thames, and, with much &s;laughter, made their way through a great number
<PB N="209" REF="223">
of the Britons, who had endeavoured to &s;top their pa&s;&s;age. They took Camlodunum <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Malden in E&s;&s;ex.</NOTE> the capital of one of the Briti&s;h Princes; and they pa&s;&s;ed on with &s;uch a victorious quickne&s;s, that many of the Belgic colonies thought it a proper time to &s;ubmit. Clau|dius placed them under the government of Plau|tius; and, after a &s;tay only of &s;ixteen days in the i&s;land, returned to Gaul, in his way to Italy.</P>
<P>The per&s;onal pre&s;ence of a powerful prince, is of great efficacy wherever he goes. The <HI>veni, vidi, vici</HI> of Julius, was a motto accidently ap|plicable to Claudius Cae&s;ar, who, in a little more than a fortnight &s;ubdued, partly by arms, and partly by the terror of his name, four colonies of Britons <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><LIST>
<ITEM>The Trinobantes, inhabitants of Hertford&s;hire, E&s;&s;ex, and Middle&s;ex.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Cantii, inhabitants of Kent.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Regni, inhabitants of Su&s;&s;ex and Surry.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Atrebates, inhabitants of Berk&s;hire.</ITEM>
</LIST></NOTE>. Plautius judged rightly in &s;ending for &s;uch a figure to be carried about, at the head of the army: his judgment was not le&s;s exqui&s;ite, in &s;ending it as quickly back. A longer &s;tay might have di&s;covered the idol to have been pa&s;teboard; and the Britons might have de&s;pi&s;ed the pageant, when they found it only a moving machine in the human form.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Claudius had &s;et &s;ail, the Romans re&s;olved upon a farther progre&s;s into different parts of our i&s;land. They divided their troops under the command of two generals. Aulus Plautius, the propraetor, and Flavius Ve&s;pa&s;ianus, afterwards
<PB N="210" REF="224">
Emperor. The actions of Ve&s;pa&s;ian are men|tioned by Dio and Suetonius, and are particularly extolled by Tacitus. Our Engli&s;h Hi&s;torians are no le&s;s profu&s;e in his prai&s;es. Mo&s;t of them a&s;&s;ign to him the conque&s;t of the i&s;le of Wight; and of the &s;everal other Belgic colonies, from Hamp&s;hire, Wilt&s;hire, and Somer&s;et&s;hire, to the extremity of the we&s;tern part of Cornwall.</P>
<P>Plautius had undertaken the conque&s;t of the more inland countries: but probably finding his ta&s;k too difficult, he contented him&s;elf with the laurels which he had gained, and returned to Rome. A&s;torius Scapula &s;ucceeded him in the title of pro|praetor, and in the command of the army. Scapula, in attempting to pur&s;ue the plan of his predece&s;|&s;or, met with many difficulties. His adver&s;aries were endued with a certain &s;tubborn bravery, that &s;corned the &s;uperior power of the Romans. They fought with the re&s;olution of men, who e&s;teemed the enjoyment of their laws and liberty as the great|e&s;t ble&s;&s;ings under heaven. The love of liberty, and a true devotion to its cau&s;e, &s;eems to have been implanted by nature it&s;elf in the brea&s;ts of our forefathers. How &s;trangely, and from what incidents this elementary Briti&s;h fire was frequently evaporated, and again was amazingly rekindled, mu&s;t be the &s;ubject-matter of future enquiry. Cer|tainly it never &s;hone forth with greater brightne&s;s than in the per&s;on and character of Caractacus: he was a prince of a noble birth, and a proud un|daunted &s;pirit: he was an able and a judicious commander. During nine years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, he had defended him&s;elf with inferior forces, again&s;t

O&s;torius and the Roman army. He had often &s;hifted his ground, and had withdrawn his troops into mountains and rocky places. Every pa&s;&s;age that might prove acce&s;&s;ible to the enemy, was &s;topt up, and fortified by heaps of &s;tones. At length the Romans, growing a&s;hamed of their frequent di&s;appointments, and enraged to be outdone by a Briton, demoli&s;hed his fortre&s;&s;es, and forced him to an engagement. The event of the battle was fatal to Britain in general, and particularly unfor|tunate to Caractacus, who&s;e wife and daughter were taken pri&s;oners. The unhappy prince e&s;caped, only to become more mi&s;erable: he fled, in con|fidence of receiving friend&s;hip and protection from Carti&s;mandua, queen of the Brigantes, who imme|diately betrayed him to the conquerors; and Ca|ractacus, with his captive family, were &s;ent bound in chains to Rome.</P>

<HEAD>THE TRYAL OF THE MAID OF ORLEANS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Extracted from the Archives of Normandy, by John Nagerel, canon and archdeacon of the church of No&s;tre Dame at Rouen. Communicated to the author by a friend.</HEAD>
<P>IN the year one thou&s;and four hundred and twenty nine, a young girl named Jane Tar&eacute;, of the dutchy of Lorrain, declared &s;he had frequent revelations from heaven: &s;he was the daughter of a common labourer, and her whole life had been employed in tending cattle. God commanded her, &s;he &s;aid, to go to Charles the &s;eventh, king of France, in order to advi&s;e and a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the recovery of his dominions, then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>She was brought before the governor of Vau|couleurs, who looked upon her as di&s;ordered in her mind, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her. She in&s;i&s;ted how|ever &s;o &s;trongly, and per&s;evered &s;o much in her re|&s;olutions to go and offer her &s;ervices to Charles, that the governor at la&s;t contented to have her con|ducted to Chinon where the king re&s;ided.</P>
<P>Her behaviour there did not &s;hew the embarra&s;&s;|ment of a country girl, but the unaffected politene&s;s and ceremony of a courtier. She immediately di&s;tingui&s;hed her royal ma&s;ter from among the crowd of his attendants, and &s;aid to him that &s;he came in compliance to the almighty's orders to rai&s;e
<PB N="213" REF="227">
the &s;iege of Orleans, and to recover the kingdom from Engli&s;h u&s;urpation, de&s;ired him not to be apprehen&s;ive of his enemies: that &s;he would attack them wherever &s;he met them: that &s;he made no doubt of &s;ucceeding in her attempts: and that his maje&s;ty &s;hould be &s;oon peaceably e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the throne of his ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>Charles ordered this extraordinary young wo|man to be examined in matters of religion; and a&s;ked her &s;everal que&s;tions relative to the art of war, and other curious &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Her an&s;wers were &s;o pertinent and &s;o ju&s;t, that the king, the prelates, and the other clergy who were pre&s;ent, were very much amazed. It was revealed to her, &s;he &s;aid, that in a neighbouring church was hid a &s;word on which five Flower-de|luces, the arms of France, were engraved.</P>
<P>The &s;word was &s;earched for, and found among &s;ome old iron in the church &s;he had mentioned. The king pre&s;ented it to her, and &s;he was &s;oon ac|coutred in warlike dre&s;s. Every thing &s;eemed fa|miliar to her mind; her activity and addre&s;s were equal to tho&s;e of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed warriors.</P>
<P>When &s;he was admitted to his maje&s;ty's council to advi&s;e on the exigency of affairs, &s;he &s;poke with &s;o much knowledge, with &s;o much prudence and wi&s;dom, that her opinion was often followed, and that of the mo&s;t experienced generals laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P>But what was more a&s;toni&s;hing, when a council was held in her ab&s;ence, &s;he knew every thing that was propo&s;ed and concluded there. However, his maje&s;ty thought proper to de&s;ire the maid to give him &s;ome unque&s;tionable proofs of her being the me&s;|&s;enger
<PB N="214" REF="228">
of God, as he might then entirely confide in her advice, and follow her in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>To which Jane an&s;wered,
<Q>Sire, if I can di&s;|cover to you your thoughts, which you confided to God alone, will you firmly believe that I am his me&s;&s;enger?</Q></P>
<P>Charles &s;aid he would; on which &s;he a&s;ked him if he remembered that &s;ome months before, in the chapel of his ca&s;tle of Loches, he privately and alone humbly begged three things from heaven?</P>
<P>The king remembred very well his having made reque&s;ts to God, which he had not &s;ince revealed even to his confe&s;&s;or; and &s;aid that he would no longer doubt of Jane's divine legation, if &s;he could tell him what the&s;e entreaties were?</P>
<P>Your fir&s;t &s;uit was then, continued Jane, that if you were not the true heir to the crown of France, God would plea&s;e to deprive you of the courage and de&s;ire of continuing a war, in order to po&s;&s;e&s;s it, which had already cau&s;ed &s;o much blood&s;hed and mi&s;ery throughout the kingdom. Your &s;econd prayer was, that if the great troubles and misfor|tunes which the poor inhabitants of France have lately underwent, were the puni&s;hment of any &s;ins by you committed, that he would plea&s;e to relieve the people of France, that you alone might be pu|ni&s;hed, and make expiation, either by death or any torment he would plea&s;e to inflict. Your third de|&s;ire was, that if the &s;ins of the people were the cau&s;e of their &s;ufferings, he would be plea&s;ed in his divine mercy to grant them pardon, and deliver them from the pains and mi&s;eries which they have been labouring under already above twelve years.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="229">Charles knowing the truth of all &s;he &s;aid, was now firmly per&s;uaded that &s;he was a divine me&s;|&s;enger, and placed much hopes in her a&s;&s;i&s;tance towards the recovery of his kingdom: &s;oon after, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Jane, he rai&s;ed the &s;iege of Orleans, and re-took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Gien, Gergueau, Meun, Bau|genci, and many other places; and afterwards, by her per&s;ua&s;ion, he ventured through the country of Champaign, though in the hands of the Engli&s;h, and went to Rheims, where he was anointed and crowned.</P>
<P>Jane carried the royal &s;tandard at this ceremony, and, in a little time, contributed very much to the recovery of &s;everal towns and ca&s;tles. Her repu|tation was at a great height; Charles always &s;uc|ceeded in every thing which &s;he propo&s;ed and un|dertook; and in gratitude Jane had the credit of every thing that did &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>This brought upon her the hatred and envy of &s;everal of the commanders and chieftains of the French army, and at la&s;t proved fatal to her: for, in the year one thou&s;and four hundred and thirty one, the maid of Orleans being informed that the duke of Burgundy, with &s;ome Engli&s;h, had laid &s;iege to the town of Compiegn, immediately de|parted at the head of a few troops, to &s;trengthen and &s;upport the feeble garri&s;on that defended it.</P>
<P>A day or two after her arrival, &s;ome of the French lords propo&s;ed to &s;ally out again&s;t the enemy; and though Jane did not think it advi&s;e|able, yet, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected of cowardice or backwardne&s;s, &s;he con&s;ented, unfortunately for her, to be one of the number.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="230">As &s;he was &s;upporting her country's cau&s;e with valour and intrepidity, &s;ome Frenchmen gave the &s;ignal for retreat, on which every body ha&s;tened to get back to the gates, where there was &s;o great a throng, that before &s;he could enter &s;he was taken by &s;ome of the troops of John of Luxemburgh, who was at the &s;iege with the duke of Burgundy.</P>
<P>Luxemburgh ordered her to be conducted to the ca&s;tle of Beaurevoir, where &s;he was &s;trictly guarded, as he was apprehen&s;ive &s;he would endeavour to e&s;cape by magic art, or &s;ome other &s;ubtle means. The king of England, fearing that Luxemburgh would give her back to the French for a con&s;iderable ran&s;om, was very anxious to have her in his own cu&s;tody: but Luxemburgh ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to deliver his pri&s;oner; &s;o that Henry was obliged to have recour&s;e to the bi&s;hop of Beauvais, in who&s;e dioce&s;s &s;he had been taken, entreating him to de|mand her as a per&s;on &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected of here&s;y and witchcraft, and therefore liable to be examined and tried by him, according to the laws of pro|ceeding again&s;t heretics.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop, after much deliberation, con&s;ented to demand the &s;u&s;pected Jane from Luxemburgh, on paying him a rea&s;onable ran&s;om, if the a&s;&s;em|bly of divines of the univer&s;ity of Paris would ad|vi&s;e him &s;o to do.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;embly not only was of opinion that he could and ought to do it, but al&s;o in complai&s;ance, to the king of England, wrote to John of Lux|emburgh, in the name of the univer&s;ity, praying him to &s;end his pri&s;oner to the bi&s;hop of Beauvais,
<PB N="217" REF="231">
in who&s;e dioce&s;e &s;he was &s;till in cu&s;tody, and who alone had the right of trying her for the crimes of which &s;he &s;tood accu&s;ed.</P>
<P>This letter had the de&s;ired effect, and Jane was given up to the bi&s;hop, who immediately put her into the hands of the Engli&s;h, by whom &s;he was carried to Rouen, and there kept in &s;trong and clo&s;e confinement. Soon after, the king of England &s;ent the following order to the magi&s;trates of Rouen, to deliver Jane to be examined and tried by the bi&s;hop of Beauvais.</P>
<P>"Henry, by the grace of God, king of France and England, to our magi&s;trates of Rouen greeting. It is publicly known, that for &s;ome time pa&s;t a woman who calls her&s;elf Jane the Maiden, laying a&s;ide the dre&s;s and habit of her &s;ex, which is again&s;t the law of God, and prohibited as an abominable practice by every law, and taking the dre&s;s and manner of man, has been guilty of many cruel ho|micides; and, in order to abu&s;e the weak minds of the people, has made them under&s;tand that &s;he was a me&s;&s;enger from God, and was privy to his divine &s;ecrets, and has entertained &s;everal other opinions contrary to our catholic faith, and &s;candalous and dangerous to our mother church. That while &s;he was in ho&s;tile act again&s;t us and our people, &s;he was taken before the walls of Com|piegne by &s;ome of our loyal &s;ubjects, and brought pri&s;oner to our town of Rouen. And whereas &s;he has been &s;trongly and univer&s;ally &s;u&s;pected of &s;u|per&s;tition, fal&s;e doctrine, and other crimes again&s;t our holy church, we have been earne&s;tly &s;ollicited by the reverend father in God and faithful coun&s;el|lor

the bi&s;hop of Beauvais, right eccle&s;ia&s;tical judge of the &s;aid Jane, as taken in his dioce&s;s, and al&s;o entreated by our deare&s;t and mo&s;t beloved daugh|ter the univer&s;ity of Paris, to give up and deliver our &s;aid pri&s;oner to be examined and tried by the &s;aid bi&s;hop, for the crimes of which &s;he &s;tands &s;u&s;|pected and accu&s;ed; and to proceed again&s;t her according to the ordinances and di&s;po&s;itions of the divine and canon laws, in that ca&s;e made and pro|vided. And as we are willing, in reverence and honour to God, the defence and dignity of our holy church and catholic faith, devoutly to obey, as a true and humble &s;on of the holy church, the de&s;ires and demands of our daughter the univer|&s;ity of Paris, we order and de&s;ire by the&s;e pre&s;ents, our officers and magi&s;trates of Rouen, to deliver up and bring before the reverend father in God the bi&s;hop of Beauvais, the &s;aid Jane Tar&eacute;, to be tried and proceeded again&s;t according to God, to rea&s;on, and to the divine and holy canons. Given at Rouen this third day of January, year of grace one thou&s;and four hundred and thirty one, and of our reign the third."</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop, impowered by this warrant, and having communicated the accu&s;ation to the in|qui&s;itor general of the faith, he a&s;&s;embled in the royal chapel of the ca&s;tle of Rouen, Giles Abbot of Fe&s;camp, John Beaupere, John de Chati&s;&s;on, James le Ti&s;&s;ier, Nicholas Midy, Guerard Fueillet, William Hecton, Thomas de Cour&s;elles, and Richard Proty, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him at the tryal of the &s;aid Jane.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="233">John E&s;tivet, named proctor for this tryal by the bi&s;hop, moved his lord&s;hip that the pri&s;oner &s;hould be brought into court and examined accord|ing to law, which was granted; and the pri|&s;oner having de&s;ired leave to hear ma&s;s, his lord|&s;hip &s;aid that he had taken advice on that head from &s;everal per&s;ons of learning and wi&s;dom, who&s;e opinion it was, that, con&s;idering the great crimes of which &s;he &s;tood &s;u&s;pected, and having infa|mou&s;ly put on men's apparel, her reque&s;t ought not to be granted; and that therefore he over|ruled it.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip then acquainted Jane, that &s;he be|ing taken pri&s;oner in his dioce&s;e, and being pub|lickly accu&s;ed of &s;everal crimes which were again&s;t the faith, not only in France but in every other kingdom, &s;he was delivered up to him to be tried in matters of faith. After which the proctor mo|ved that the pri&s;oner &s;hould be &s;worn to an&s;wer the truth to all &s;uch que&s;tions as he &s;hould a&s;k her; which was agreed to by the bi&s;hop and his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ants.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Jane, in a mild and charitable manner, begged &s;he would make true and faithful an&s;wers to every particu|lar, as well to &s;horten the trial as for the di&s;charge of her own con&s;cience, without any mental re&s;er|vation or eva&s;ion what&s;oever.</P>
<P>To which Jane an&s;wered,
<Q>I do not know what que&s;tions you intend to a&s;k me; perhaps you may a&s;k &s;ome that I will not chu&s;e to an|&s;wer.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="234">The bi&s;hop &s;aid &s;he mu&s;t an&s;wer every que&s;tion relative to the catholic faith, and every thing el&s;e &s;he knew.</P>
<P>Jane replied, that &s;he was willing to communi|cate to the court every circum&s;tance &s;he knew about her birth, her parentage, and her arrival in France, as al&s;o every thing &s;he did &s;ince; but as to the revelations which &s;he had from God, that &s;he never told them but to Charles, whom &s;he called her king; and that &s;he would never di&s;clo&s;e them to any other, though her &s;ilence &s;hould co&s;t her her head.</P>
<P>She added, that &s;he was ordered from heaven to keep the&s;e revelations &s;ecret; but that in eight days &s;he would be able to determine whether &s;he could declare the purport of them.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop then exhorted her to tell truth in matters of faith; Jane then kneeling, placed both her hands on the ma&s;s-book, and &s;wore that &s;he would declare the truth in every thing relative to her faith; but would not di&s;clo&s;e what God had revealed to her, to any per&s;on what&s;oever.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day the court a&s;ked her &s;everal que&s;tions relative to her parents, the place of her birth, and her age.</P>
<P>On her next appearance in court &s;he complained that irons had been put on her legs: on which the bi&s;hop reminded her that &s;he often attempted to e&s;cape from pri&s;on; &s;o that the jailor was obliged to keep her in irons and clo&s;e confinement.</P>
<P>Jane owned that &s;ome time before &s;he did &s;trive to get away, as it was natural and lawful for every pri&s;oner to do; and added, that even if &s;he had
<PB N="221" REF="235">
made her e&s;cape, &s;he could, not be accu&s;ed of a breach of promi&s;e therein, as &s;he had made none to any body.</P>
<P>Upon this an&s;wer the bi&s;hop immediately or|dered John Ris, John Bernet, and William Talbot, in who&s;e hands &s;he was then entru&s;ted, to watch her narrowly; and not allow any body to &s;peak to her, without a &s;pecial order &s;igned by him.</P>
<P>She was then a&s;ked, if &s;he had ever learned any art or trade?</P>
<P>She an&s;wered, that her mother had taught her to &s;ew; and &s;he added, that &s;he did not believe there was a woman in the city of Rouen who could teach her any thing. She &s;aid that &s;he had left her parent's hou&s;e partly through fear of the duke of Burgundy's army; that &s;he went to Neufchattel with a woman named La Rou&s;e, where &s;he re|mained a fortnight; that &s;he was there in quality of maid-&s;ervant, and did not go to the fields to take care of &s;heep or other cattle during that time.</P>
<P>Being a&s;ked if &s;he confe&s;&s;ed every year?</P>
<P>She an&s;wered, &s;he did, to her pari&s;h prie&s;t, ex|cept when he happened to be bu&s;y, and then &s;he confe&s;&s;ed to another prie&s;t with his leave; that &s;he had confe&s;&s;ed two or three times to a mendicant friar; and that &s;he received the body of our Saviour every year at Ea&s;ter.</P>
<P>Being a&s;ked whether &s;he received the body of our Saviour at other fe&s;tivals be&s;ides Ea&s;ter?</P>
<P>She made no an&s;wer; but &s;aid, that from the age of thirteen &s;he heard the voice of our &s;aviour, which directed her how to behave; that the fir&s;t time &s;he heard the voice &s;he was in very great fear;
<PB N="222" REF="236">
that &s;he heard it about mid-day, in &s;ummer time, in her father's garden, it being that day a fa&s;t; that the voice &s;eemed to come from the right, where the neighbouring church was &s;ituated; that &s;he perceived a certain brightne&s;s which accompanied the voice; that when &s;he had heard it the third time, &s;he knew it to be a heavenly voice; that it has taken care of her &s;ince that time.</P>
<P>Being a&s;ked what information &s;he received from the voice, for the &s;afety of her &s;oul?</P>
<P>She an&s;wered, that it &s;hewed how to conduct her&s;elf in life; that it recommended to her to fre|quent church and other devout exerci&s;es; after|wards it told her it was nece&s;&s;ary &s;he &s;hould go to France, which it repeated twice or thrice a week till &s;he departed: it de&s;ired her to make ha&s;te, and go away unknown to her parents; that &s;he was to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Orleans; that &s;he &s;hould go to Robert de Baudricourt, who would give her guides to conduct her; that &s;he then &s;aid to the voice, that &s;he was but a poor country girl, and entirely ignorant of the art of war; that &s;he went &s;oon af|ter to her uncle's hou&s;e, where &s;he &s;taid a week; that her uncle carried her to Robert de Baudricourt; that the voice had taught her to di&s;tingui&s;h this gentleman, though &s;he had never &s;een him before; that he twice refu&s;ed to grant her de&s;ire; but at la&s;t he was prevailed on to have her conducted to France; that &s;he then a&s;&s;umed man's apparel, and wore a &s;word which Robert de Baudricourt gave her a little before &s;he departed; that &s;he was ac|companied by a knight and four other men; that &s;he often heard the voice on her road to France.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="237">Being a&s;ked, who advi&s;ed her to put on man's apparel?</P>
<P>She an&s;wered, that the voice in&s;tructed her &s;o to do; and that &s;he accu&s;ed no other per&s;on of it: that on her departure from Robert de Baudricourt, he &s;aid to her,
<Q>You may depart, let what will happen.</Q>
She al&s;o added that it was ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary &s;he &s;hould change her dre&s;s. Some time after &s;he &s;aid that &s;he was &s;ure the duke of Orleans was much beloved by God; that there was not a man in France, except the king, of whom &s;he had &s;o many revelations as of the duke of Orleans.</P>
<P>Being a&s;ked, what letters &s;he &s;ent to the Engli&s;h, and what was the purport of them?</P>
<P>She an&s;wered, that &s;he addre&s;&s;ed &s;ome letters to the Engli&s;h who were before Orleans, de&s;iring them to part from thence; and that they would ab&s;olutely be obliged to rai&s;e the &s;iege: that &s;he has been told that &s;ome words had been altered in her letters, where &s;he de&s;ired the French territories &s;hould be given up to Charles, the lawful king. In the place of which have been in&s;erted, as &s;he was informed, that they &s;hould be given up to Jane the Maiden: that &s;he did not call her&s;elf a warrior in the&s;e letters, as it was &s;aid, had been &s;ince added to them.</P>
<P>She then related, that &s;he arrived without any difficulty at Chinon, where the king re&s;ided; that &s;he arrived about noon, lodged at an inn, and after dinner waited on his maje&s;ty, whom &s;he immedi|ately di&s;tingui&s;hed from his attendants, by the in|&s;tructions of the voice; that &s;he told him &s;he

was re&s;olved to go fight again&s;t the Engli&s;h. Being a&s;ked whether, when the voice pointed out the king to her, there was any &s;hining light over the king? &s;he would make no an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Being a&s;ked, whether &s;he &s;aw any angel over the king's head?</P>
<P>She made no an&s;wer; but &s;aid, that before his maje&s;ty employed her, &s;he had many fine vi&s;ions and revelations.</P>
<P>Being a&s;ked what revelations?</P>
<P>She an&s;wered,
<Q>I will not tell you as yet; but you may go to the king and he will inform you.</Q>
She added, that the voice told her that &s;oon after her arrival his maje&s;ty would accept the offer of her &s;ervices; that tho&s;e of her own party were confident the voice came from God; that they &s;aw and heard the voice; that &s;he knew it very well; that the king and &s;everal of his council had heard and &s;een the voice coming towards her; and among the re&s;t Charles duke of Bourbon; that the only thing &s;he ever a&s;ked of the voice was, the &s;alvation of her &s;oul; that it de&s;ired her to &s;tay at St. Dennis in France, where &s;he would have re|mained, but that the lords would not let her, as &s;he was wounded; and that otherwi&s;e &s;he would not have left it; that &s;he had been wounded in the trenches of Paris, and cured in five days; that &s;he commanded at a con&s;iderable attack near Paris.</P>
<P>Being a&s;ked, if it was a holiday when that &s;kir|mi&s;h happened?</P>

<P>The court adjourned to con&s;ider matters, and being met again, the bi&s;hop of Beauvais exhorted and de&s;ired the pri&s;oner to &s;wear ab&s;olutely, and without re&s;erve to tell the truth of every thing the court would a&s;k her.</P>
<P>On which &s;he de&s;ired his lord&s;hip's leave to &s;peak, and it being granted, &s;aid,
<Q>It is po&s;&s;ible you may a&s;k me que&s;tions which I certainly will not an&s;wer, e&s;pecially relative to revelations; perhaps you would in&s;i&s;t on my informing you of what I already &s;wore I would not mention; that would be perjury, and you ought not to de&s;ire me to perjure my&s;elf. Take care, my lord bi&s;hop, what you are about; you pretend you have juri&s;diction over me; you will have a great deal to an&s;wer for if you do not prove an up|right judge to me.</Q>
She added, that &s;he thought it enough to have &s;wore twice.</P>
<P>Being a&s;ked a &s;econd time, if &s;he would not &s;wear &s;imply and ab&s;olutely?</P>
<P>She an&s;wered, that they might do without it, as &s;he had already &s;wore twice; that all the clergy of Rouen &s;hould not oblige her to tell every thing; that &s;he could not tell all in eight days; that &s;he would communicate every circum&s;tance of her ar|rival in France, but not every thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>Being de&s;ired a third time to &s;wear without re|&s;erve, and informed that her refu&s;al would render her &s;u&s;pected to the court, &s;he made the &s;ame an|&s;wer as before, and added, that &s;he was come from God; that &s;he had nothing to do in that court,
<PB N="226" REF="240">
and de&s;ired they might &s;end her back to God, who&s;e me&s;&s;enger &s;he was.</P>
<P>Being again exhorted and advi&s;ed to &s;wear as before required, under pain of being found guilty of the crimes of which &s;he was accu&s;ed,</P>
<P>She an&s;wered, "I have &s;wore enough, pro|ceed."</P>
<P>Being once more fully and &s;trongly admoni&s;hed to tell the whole truth relative to her ca&s;e, let|ting her know the danger &s;he put her&s;elf in by a refu&s;al, &s;he &s;aid &s;he was ready to tell every thing concerning her ca&s;e, but not every thing &s;he knew; and then &s;he &s;wore.</P>
<P>Being a&s;ked by John Beaupere, when before had &s;he eat or drank?</P>
<P>She an&s;wered, that afternoon.</P>
<P>Being then a&s;ked, when had &s;he heard the voice?</P>

<P>She an&s;wered, not that &s;he knew.</P>
<P>Being a&s;ked, if &s;he thanked the voice, and whe|ther &s;he went on her knees?</P>
<P>She an&s;wered, that &s;he thanked it as &s;he &s;at up in her bed; her hands joined, and begged it might direct her what &s;he had to do; and that the voice de&s;ired her, <HI>to an&s;wer &s;toutly</HI></P>

<P>Being a&s;ked if it was an angel directly from God without the intervention of any &s;aint?</P>
<P>She an&s;wered,
<Q>It comes from God, I will not tell you all I know on that &s;ubject; I am more unea&s;y, le&s;t I &s;hould &s;ay any thing at which it might be di&s;plea&s;ed, than I am about an&s;wering you; and therefore relative to this que&s;tion, I de&s;ire delay.</Q></P>
<P>Being a&s;ked whether &s;he thought that God would be offended at truth's being told?</P>
<P>She an&s;wered, &s;he thought he would not; but that what the voice revealed to her, &s;he was to tell Charles the Seventh, king of France, and not to the bi&s;hop of Beauvais.

<P>Upon which the court de&s;ired to know whether &s;he could not prevail on the voice to go deliver a me&s;&s;age from her to Charles with the&s;e tidings?</P>

<HEAD>PHILOSOPHY FOR THE LADIES CONTINUED.</HEAD>

<HEAD>Of the Metamorpho&s;es of ANIMALS, and the &s;everal Changes ob&s;ervable in ANIMAL LIFE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE &s;carcely ever perhaps was any &s;y&s;|tem, doctrine, or opinion broach'd with more a&s;&s;urance, or that, for the time of its vogue, met with a greater and more univer&s;al approbation, than that which urg'd the idea of a metemp&s;ycho&s;is, or tran&s;migration of the &s;oul, the &s;pring or &s;ource of action, into various organized bodies, in which it had opportunities of exerting it&s;elf in different manners, and of producing different effects. Py|thagoras, who was perhaps the wi&s;e&s;t as well as the mo&s;t humane of all the heathen philo&s;ophers, was, if not the fir&s;t, at lea&s;t the mo&s;t con&s;iderable among&s;t all tho&s;e who gave any &s;anction to a prin|ciple, which, however productive of the mo&s;t de|&s;irable effects, has neverthele&s;s appeared extremely ab&s;urd; and, con&s;equently, in ages more enlight|end
<PB N="230" REF="244">
in philo&s;ophical, tho' perhaps le&s;s &s;o in the more advantageous branches of real knowledge, has been rejected as entirely di&s;&s;onant to experimental conviction; and therefore, without trial, judge, or jury, de&s;erving to be ca&s;t a&s;ide by tho&s;e who think they can know nothing unle&s;s they are ma&s;ters of every thing; and would almo&s;t renounce an inter|cour&s;e with the Lord of nature, unle&s;s they thought them&s;elves able to dive into every motive of his actions.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding, however, this univer&s;al rejec|tion of a &s;y&s;tem once was univer&s;ally received, &s;ome of the more calm and rational devotees of philo&s;ophy have with great ju&s;tice imagined, that an opinion advanced with &s;o much po&s;itivene&s;s, and accepted with &s;o much zeal; inculcated by a man who could not impo&s;e on him&s;elf, and followed by a &s;et of people who &s;carcely could be impo&s;ed upon, mu&s;t have more in it than at fir&s;t &s;ight it appears to con|vey. Some of the&s;e, therefore, have endeavoured to &s;olve it, by &s;uppo&s;ing a hidden meaning, and others by imagining a conceal'd intention to be veiled under a principle which, in its literal &s;en&s;e, was &s;o repugnant both to the innate conviction of the learned, and the hourly ob&s;ervation of the vul|gar. The fir&s;t cla&s;s of the&s;e rationali&s;ts imagined the impul&s;e of a benevolent mind to have been the only motive that urg'd that great philo&s;opher to advance a doctrine, which would terrify mankind from the de&s;truction of animals, either in general or in particular, by the &s;uppo&s;ition of a po&s;&s;ibility that, in taking away the life of any animal, how|ever indifferent or even hurtful it might be to them
<PB N="231" REF="245">
for other rea&s;ons, the animated part, perhaps, of &s;ome dear relation, or renowned ance&s;tor, might not only be di&s;turbed, but even be exil'd from the &s;pot of its immediate re&s;idence, and not improbably tran&s;planted into &s;ome &s;tate more painful and op|po&s;ite to its natural bia&s;s and inclination, and &s;till more contrary to our own ideas of happine&s;s and &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Another &s;et again, calling to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance the my&s;terious inve&s;tigations of the cabala, have en|deavoured to prove that Pythagoras having &s;tudy'd very clo&s;ely the Egyptian mythology, which per|petually dealt in my&s;tery and hieroglyphics, &s;ome conceal'd meaning was &s;till conveyed in every part of his philo&s;ophy: and that, like the parables and fables of the ea&s;tern teachers, every thing he preach'd was merely allegorical, only to be under|&s;tood by tho&s;e whom he cho&s;e peculiarly to en|lighten, that is to &s;ay, by the di&s;ciples of his own &s;chool; whil&s;t to the vulgar an external &s;hew of &s;omewhat was &s;et forth, which, from his <HI>ip&s;e dixit</HI> alone, they were bound implicitly to obey.</P>
<P>Now it is by no means impo&s;&s;ible that both of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions may in &s;ome mea&s;ure be right: that is to &s;ay, that the amiable &s;age we have mentioned might, from a perfect knowledge of the power of &s;uper&s;tition on the mind of unin&s;tructed men, make u&s;e of a maxim &s;o well adapted for the purpo&s;e, to put a check to that unlimited de&s;truction of animal life, which luxury and &s;portive cruelty had introduced into the world; and al&s;o that he might at the &s;ame time, under the veil of a like fable, convey to tho&s;e, who were his more immediate pupils, the idea
<PB N="232" REF="246">
of that incorruptibility of the human &s;oul, which, from a want of tho&s;e advantages that revelation has be&s;towed on us, he might imagine nece&s;&s;ary to find &s;ome employment and di&s;tinction for; and by ordaining &s;uch di&s;tinction in one period of its ex|i&s;tence, to be pointed out and determined by the in|clination &s;hewn by it in the preceding one, he might &s;uppo&s;e, and no doubt his &s;uppo&s;ition met with confirmation from experience, that his di&s;|ciples would be likely to model their actions ac|cording as they were influenced by the hope of re|reward or dread of puni&s;hment,</P>
<P>Thus far, therefore, may the &s;ugge&s;tions which have been advanced in the Pythagorean philo&s;ophy be well grounded. Yet there &s;eems to be one mo&s;t palpable ob&s;ervation, which has &s;lipp'd all the com|mentators on, and &s;olvers of this doctrine I have hitherto met with; and that is, from whence the fir&s;t idea of &s;uch an opinion derived its original idea? No remembrance, no conception of a pre-exi&s;tent &s;tate, continued in the mind of man to give it credit, and the a&s;&s;urance of the perfect corrupti|bility of all animals after death, concurred in &s;ome mea&s;ure to contradict it: whereon, then, &s;hould the&s;e great men found the ba&s;is of a doctrine which, however aided forwards, and adorned by fable to confirm its power, mu&s;t have needed at lea&s;t the appearance of probability, &s;omething more than mere ip&s;e dixit, to e&s;tabli&s;h its fir&s;t be|lief in the minds of the vulgar, which, little ca|pable of philo&s;ophical rea&s;onings, or theoretical in|ve&s;tigations, mu&s;t have their ideas fixt by &s;ome connection and analogy between what their &s;en&s;es
<PB N="233" REF="247">
are capable of di&s;cerning, and what their minds are to be taught to believe?</P>
<P>This being premi&s;ed, from whence could be derived the doctrine of the Metemp&s;ycho&s;is, or tran&s;migration of the &s;oul; but from a &s;imilar tran&s;|migration of the more vi&s;ible &s;oul; that is to &s;ay, of animal life, di&s;tingui&s;hable from the &s;lighte&s;t ob&s;ervation of Nature's works, and hourly perform|ed under our very eyes? Of the&s;e changes there are many varieties; of which it is impo&s;&s;ible that the ancient philo&s;ophers, who were perhaps clo&s;er and more accurate ob&s;ervers than the moderns, could have been ignorant of in their fulle&s;t extent: and as even the very hu&s;bandman and labourer mu&s;t al&s;o be well informed of &s;everal of them, it is not in the lea&s;t improbable that an advantageous u&s;e might be made of the&s;e &s;o well-known circum|&s;tances, for the illu&s;trating and enforcing opinions, which it was nece&s;&s;ary to inculcate the mo&s;t forcibly in tho&s;e minds which were the lea&s;t capable of &s;pe|culative or hypothetical theology.</P>
<P>Here, however, let us drop this conjecture, which I have rather introduced with a view of cor|roborating the principle which I fir&s;t &s;et out with in defence of the &s;tudy of philo&s;ophy, viz. that the ob&s;ervations we cannot avoid making in the cour&s;e of it, may be employed with great propriety towards humanizing the heart, and producing the mo&s;t amiable effects in the general oeconomy of life and government. Was I to expatiate farther on the very &s;ubject before us, it might not perhaps be difficult to evince that the&s;e changes, even of the very lowe&s;t cla&s;s of animals, that is to &s;ay, of the
<PB N="234" REF="248">
in&s;ect tribe, might be rendered not un&s;erviceable even in the pre&s;ent more enlightened period, when chri&s;tianity and revelation have drawn us out of the labyrinths of doubt and &s;ugge&s;tion into the plainer and unwinding paths of more a&s;&s;ured truth; yet &s;till, I &s;ay, the&s;e changes might form to us, by analogy, the idea of a future and more ex|alted &s;tate; and convince us, that whil&s;t we &s;ee the very minute&s;t animals undergoing amazing alter|ations and metamorpho&s;es, ri&s;ing from the gro|velling &s;tate of a grub or water-worm, to range the wide expan&s;e of air, before they &s;ubmit to the uni|ver&s;al law of annihilation, it mu&s;t be impo&s;&s;ible that the Lord of them all, for who&s;e u&s;e, amu&s;ement, or in&s;truction, they have all been created, &s;hould only pa&s;s through a &s;eries of years, for the mo&s;t part mi&s;erable ones, even with tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s the happie&s;t lot on earth, in little more than meer animal exi&s;tence, and then &s;ink down into the grave in common with them all, without enjoying &s;ome more exalted privilege; and, in proportion to the rank he here po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, becoming le&s;s encumber'd and fit to travel through and fully reli&s;h tho&s;e other works of the Creator, of which even now, before
<Q>We have &s;haken off this mortal coil,</Q>
The very idea dazzles our imagination, and con|founds our faculties; and of which we &s;ee ju&s;t e|nough of to admire his power, but know not &s;uf|ficiently to comprehend his wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>From the&s;e reflections, however, let us proceed to relate to our fair readers what the&s;e changes are, of which we have here been &s;peaking, and of which the&s;e reflectional u&s;es may be made.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="249">They are of many different kinds, and proceed, as all nature's works do, in a regular gradation; forming an a&s;cent, the &s;teps of which are &s;carcely vi&s;ible; and yet the height, when we have reached it, mo&s;t obvious and amazing.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e kinds of animals which are viviparous, or produce their young alive, and apparently in a complete &s;tate, undergo the &s;lighte&s;t alterations of any; yet &s;ome even they have. Growth it&s;elf, the di&s;ten&s;ion of parts, and increa&s;e of bulk, may be looked on as the lowe&s;t &s;teps of this ladder, and the&s;e all animals have in common, man not excepted; who, lordly as he is, when in his more perfect growth, is not only the mo&s;t helple&s;s and imperfect at his birth, but longer continues in that &s;ituation, than any other member of the animal world.&mdash;Except|ing this incrementive change, however, he under|goes no other alteration in this life, but the addi|tion of &s;ome excremental parts, &s;uch as teeth, hair, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Next to him, in &s;tability of condition, we mu&s;t place the quadrupeds, who, be&s;ide the&s;e additions, &s;eem to be annually changed by the lo&s;s and reno|vation of their external covering, which almo&s;t all of them &s;uffer, by what we call ca&s;ting their coats. This change however is very gradual, and almo&s;t invi&s;ible, the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tances, and bearing the very &s;ame marks and colours, &s;ucceeding to their prede|ce&s;&s;ors, &s;o as to leave the animal in appearance the very &s;ame he was at fir&s;t. One exception however there is to this, in tho&s;e which undergo this alteration twice within the cour&s;e of the year, as do the bears, foxes, hares, &amp;c. in Greenland and other cold coun|tries,
<PB N="236" REF="250">
who&s;e furs in the winter &s;ea&s;on intirely drop tho&s;e colours which would render them more con&s;picu|ous to their re&s;pective enemies, by &s;tanding con|tra&s;ted to the whitene&s;s of the &s;now with which the whole ground is covered, and a&s;&s;ume a pure white; which again quits them as the warmth of &s;ummer, by re&s;toring the re&s;t of nature to its original ap|pearance, renders &s;uch a refuge unnece&s;&s;ary to them.</P>
<P>One cla&s;s however of the viviparous animals un|dergo a more immediate and vi&s;ible alteration, and that is the &s;erpent kind, who, having no hair or furr to lo&s;e more gradually, ca&s;t their whole covering at once in certain periods; and are &s;o dexterous in the doing this, although devoid of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of feet or claws, that the whole &s;kins of them will frequently be found entire, with|out even &s;o much as the cornea, or outward ca&s;e of the eyes, which is affixed to the re&s;t of the exu|vium, being at all broken. From this renovation, which was well known to the ancients, and which is even attended by an additional brilliancy of co|louring, a fre&s;h glow of beauty, and a renewal of that &s;trength and vigour which is con&s;tantly abated &s;ome little time before the change is brought about, it was that the antient writers con&s;idered the &s;nake as an emblem of health; as may be &s;een in its be|ing made the &s;ymbol of E&s;culapius, the God of phy&s;ic, and a repre&s;entation of time and eternity, ever de&s;troyed and ever renewing, as we find from many of their coins; in which this animal, hold|ing his tail in his mouth, is con&s;tantly attended with &s;ome legend or device expre&s;&s;ive of dura|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="251">Next to the&s;e are the oviparous animals, or tho&s;e who make their fir&s;t appearance in a &s;tate of intire inaction, and devoid of any &s;ign of life, but that of &s;ome kind of vital warmth; but yet afterwards, either by the natural heat of the tender parent, by the warmth of the &s;urrounding atmo&s;phere, or by the more inten&s;e rays of the &s;un, are, as it were, ripened by degrees; and being &s;ecured, through the period of infantile inactivity, in a cell wherein food, raiment, and lodging are di&s;pen&s;ed within them&s;elves, they at length bur&s;t forth, &s;ome in their fully complete &s;tate, as the lizards, &s;piders, crabs, lob&s;ters, &amp;c. and in general all the &s;pecies of fi&s;h; and others, among&s;t which are all the bird-cla&s;s, requiring the &s;ame degree of perfecting that the viviparous ones do, by the addiction of their excrementitious parts, &s;uch as feathers, &amp;c.&mdash;And of the&s;e creatures almo&s;t every &s;pecies that we are acquainted with &s;tands in need be&s;ides of tho&s;e ad|ditional alterations we have mentioned in the vivi|parous cla&s;&s;es. The birds of all &s;orts moult their feathers at certain periods, and even change the colour of them in the winter &s;ea&s;ons of the cold countries, as we have de&s;cribed the quadrupeds to do by their furs. The lizard kind drop their &s;kins like the &s;nakes, (which they the neare&s;t re&s;emble in &s;ub&s;tance, and even in figure, excepting the addition of four very &s;hort feet) and &s;ome of them, particu|larly the water-newt, &s;o frequently as once in every fortnight or three weeks; and all the &s;pider, crab, and lob&s;ter kind, who&s;e outward coverings are cru&s;taceous, and therefore incapable of di&s;tention, and &s;o connected as not to be gradually dropt like
<PB N="238" REF="252">
hair or feathers, ca&s;t their &s;hells entire at certain times of the year, when nature kindly provides them with &s;uch &s;upplimentary juices as, by a &s;ort of exudation from their pores, form a new &s;hell beneath.</P>
<P>Now, however, let us proceed to tho&s;e who&s;e metamorpho&s;es are more complete and di&s;tinct; and which, being fir&s;t allodged by the parent in one ele|ment, or appearing fully po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of animal life under one figure, do afterwards a&s;&s;ume another and very different form, and find their food, their bu|&s;ine&s;s, and their plea&s;ure in another and very diffe|rent element.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e &s;ome live their fir&s;t period in the earth, others in the water. The inhabitants of this la&s;t named element content them&s;elves with making earth their re&s;idence in their completer &s;tate; whil&s;t tho&s;e who fir&s;t creep on the earth, when be|come more perfect, u&s;ually find the air the region where their more improved form is enabled to ex|ert its abilites.</P>
<P>As we do not propo&s;e to enter here into a parti|cular natural hi&s;tory, but only to treat of a general property, we need only mention a &s;ingle example of each kind. The frog is the mo&s;t univer&s;ally known in&s;tance of the fir&s;t &s;ort; the egg of which, being laid and nouri&s;hed in the water, produces a &s;mall, but lively animal, which we call a tadpole. Its body is almo&s;t globular, and &s;eems furni&s;hed with no other limbs but a thin filmy tail, which &s;erves to &s;teer and move its body very bri&s;kly in the water, to which its re&s;idence is entirely confined, during its continuance in this form; yet, after a
<PB N="239" REF="253">
certain &s;pace of time, &s;mall legs and feet begin to be di&s;cernible under the loo&s;ened skin of this little creature, which gradually bur&s;ting their way thro' it, fir&s;t one, then a &s;econd, and &s;o to the number of four, and la&s;tly, dropping the finney tail which had hitherto been &s;o very u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary to it, it now, as if it di&s;dained the element it had fir&s;t been bred in, leaps on &s;hore, and &s;pringing over large tracts of land, becomes changed from a fi&s;h to a per|fect terre&s;trial quadruped, and ranges at large over that very ground on which during its former &s;tate it would have been death for it to have been ca&s;t.</P>
<P>Of the other part of metamorpho&s;is of the&s;e &s;tates, viz. from the earth to the air, we &s;hall men|tion at pre&s;ent only the beetle cla&s;s, and more par|ticularly the cock-chaffer, or jeffry-cock, as an in|&s;ect univer&s;ally known. The female of this ani|mal lays her eggs in the earth, where, by means of an in&s;trument, which nature has purpo&s;ely provided her with, &s;he is able to depo&s;it them at &s;ome depth below the &s;urface. Each of the&s;e, after a due time, is hatched into a &s;oft white jointed grub, with &s;ix &s;hort clawed feet, and armed about the head, which is of a dark-brown colour, with a &s;helly coat, and two or three pair of very &s;trong fangs or for|cipes, by which means it is mo&s;t amply furni&s;hed with the means of forcing its way in the mold where it was lodged, and of cutting and tearing to pieces for its nouri&s;hment the roots not only of the ten|derer herbage, but even tho&s;e fibres which the &s;tronger roots of trees pu&s;h forth to form a &s;urer hold in the ground, to both which the&s;e voracious

animals frequently do very great mi&s;chief. After continuing however in this &s;ituation, with no dif|ference but increa&s;e of bulk, for two whole years, a &s;helly covering forms over its &s;oft body; a pair of fine and filmy wings grow from the top of his back, to pre&s;erve which from danger, when unne|ce&s;&s;ary for u&s;e, a pair of cru&s;taceous coverings are provided, and now forcing his way thro' the &s;urface of the ground, he comes forth a lively inhabitant of the air; and &s;oaring at will wherever he plea&s;es, &s;eems, by a buzzing &s;ong, to proclaim his &s;atisfac|tion at being able now with equal greedine&s;s to de|vour the leaves and fruits, as he had before done the roots and fibres of whatever plant or tree he chu&s;es to fix upon.</P>

<P>_I AM one of your readers, and bear you that &s;ort of good will which we naturally feel for per&s;ons who con|tribute to our amu&s;ement. I have done what very few friends do; I have &s;poke well of you behind your back, and have not &s;crupled to declare in all companies, that Mrs. Penelope Spin|dle's attack upon your reputation is extremely unju&s;t.</P>
<P>She denies that you are lineally de&s;cended from the ancient family of the Triflers; and confidently a&s;&s;erts that you have taken a province which you cannot fill; but unfortunately for her, the argu|ments &s;he brings in &s;upport of this opinion, are tho&s;e which may be mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sfully urged again&s;t

Mo&s;t certainly; for in this polite age, love and court&s;hip are meer trifles; marriage is a trifle; virtue is an egregious trifle; wi&s;dom, morality, religion, all are trifles; and there is no|thing &s;erious but cards. I maintain that hitherto the &s;ubjects of your paper have been con&s;i&s;tent with your title. You have knowledge enough of life to perceive that cards is the &s;ole bu&s;ine&s;s of it: and tho' there are many other &s;erious affairs, &s;uch as balls, operas, concerts, ma&s;querades, and the like, which claim the attention of per&s;ons of rank and fortune, yet all the&s;e mu&s;t yield to cards.</P>
<P>As a trifler therefore, you have wi&s;ely avoided entering upon &s;o great and important a matter: you have confined your&s;elf to &s;uch topics, as mo&s;t of your readers will readily allow to be trifles; and when you talk of wit, learning, economy; when you recommend re&s;ervedne&s;s, and a contempt for fa&s;hionable amu&s;ements, there is not a fine lady in town who does not acknowledge the propriety of your title, and declare that you are an intolerable trifler.</P>
<P>Mrs. Spindle &s;ays, it is common for periodical authors to forget their titles; that the Tatler often talks with the mo&s;t &s;olemn au&s;terity of wi&s;dom; and that the Guardian deviates into many topicks, with which, as a guardian, he has no concern. I wi&s;h, for the &s;ake of your reputation as a writer, that you would follow their example, and &s;ome|times forget your title. If you hope to have your paper read with general approbation, do not dwell &s;o much upon exploded trifles, unworthy the at|tention

of per&s;ons of polite education. Rai&s;e your thoughts to things &s;olid and rational; &s;hew us the &s;trength of your rea&s;oning, in a di&s;&s;ertation on whi&s;t; and the &s;ubtilty of your wit, by leading us through all the mazes of quadril: if you have any genius for poetry, write a panegyric on loo; and if you dare venture on &s;o &s;ublime a &s;ubject, let your mu&s;e record the daring flights of brag.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF HARRIOT AND SOPHIA CONTINUED.</HEAD>
<P>AS &s;oon as Mr Herbert went away, Harriot, who had been li&s;tening, and had heard all that pa&s;t, entered the room. The virtue and &s;trength of mind her &s;i&s;ter &s;hewed in the de&s;ign &s;he had formed of flying from Sir Charles Stanley excited her envy; and &s;he would have joined with her mother in endeavouring to prevail upon her to &s;tay, to prevent the &s;uperiority &s;uch conduct gave her, had not that envy found a more &s;en&s;ible gra|tification in the thought that Sophia would no lon|ger receive the adorations of the young baronet; and that all her towering hopes would be changed to di&s;appointment and grief.</P>
<P>The di&s;continuance of tho&s;e pre&s;ents which Sir Charles &s;o liberally be&s;towed on them, evidently on Sophia's account, and which had hitherto enabled them to live in affluence, affected her but little; for vanity is a more powerful pa&s;&s;ion than intere&s;t in the heart of a coquet; and the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing her &s;i&s;ter mortified and de&s;erted by her lover out-weighed
<PB N="247" REF="261">
all other confiderations: be&s;ides, &s;he was not without hopes that when Sophia was out of the way, her charms would regain all their former in|fluence over the heart of Sir Charles.</P>
<P>She came prepared therefore to &s;upport her in her re&s;olution of going into the country; but Mrs. Darnley, who did not enter into her views, and who had no other attention but to &s;ecure to her&s;elf that ea&s;e and affluence &s;he at pre&s;ent en|joyed, expected Harriot would u&s;e her utmo&s;t efforts to prevent her &s;i&s;ter from di&s;obliging a man who&s;e liberality was the &s;ource of their hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>She complained to her in a tender manner of Sophia's unkindne&s;s; &s;he exaggerated the ill con|&s;equences that might be apprehended from the affront &s;he put on Sir Charles, by thus avowing the mo&s;t injurious &s;u&s;picions of him; and declared &s;he expected nothing le&s;s than to be reduced by the lo&s;s of her pen&s;ion to that &s;tate of mi&s;ery from which he had formerly relieved her.</P>
<P>Sophia melted into tears at the&s;e words; but a moment's reflection convinced her, that her mo|ther's apprehen&s;ions were altogether groundle&s;s: Sir Charles was not capable of &s;o mean a revenge; and Sophia, on this occa&s;ion, defended him with &s;o much ardor, that Mi&s;s Darnley could not help indulging her malice, by throwing out &s;ome &s;evere &s;arca&s;ms upon the violence of her affection for a man whom &s;he affected to de&s;pi&s;e.</P>
<P>Sophia blu&s;hed; but an&s;wered calmly, "Well, &s;i&s;ter, if I love Sir Charles Stanley, I have the more "merit in leaving him."</P>
<PB N="246" REF="262">

<P><PB N="248" REF="264">
<Q>Oh, not a bit the more for that, replied Har|riot; for, as I read in one of your books ju&s;t now, <HI>Virtue would not go &s;o far, if pride did not bear her company</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>Si&s;ter, &s;aid Sophia, no woman is envious of another's virtue who is con&s;cious of her own.</Q></P>
<P>This retort threw Harriot into &s;o violent a rage, that Sophia who knew what exce&s;&s;es &s;he was ca|pable of, left the room, and retired to pack up her cloaths, that &s;he might be ready when Mr. Herbert called for her.</P>
<P>In this employment Mrs. Darnley gave her no interruption; for Harriot having quitted her mother in a huff, becau&s;e &s;he did not join with her again&s;t Sophia, &s;he was left at liberty to pur&s;ue her own reflections. After long doubt and perplexity in what manner to act, &s;he re&s;olved to con&s;ent that Sophia &s;hould depart; for &s;he &s;aw plainly that it would not be in her power to prevent it, and &s;he was willing to derive &s;ome merit from the nece&s;&s;ity &s;he was under of complying. She con&s;idered that if Sir Charles really loved her daughter, her flight on &s;uch motives would rather increa&s;e than le&s;&s;en his pa&s;&s;ion; and that all his re&s;entment for being de|prived of her &s;ight would fall upon Mr. Herbert, who was alone in fault.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley, as has been before ob&s;erved, was not of a temper to anticipate misfortunes, or to give her&s;elf much unea&s;ine&s;s about evils in futurity: &s;he always hoped the be&s;t, not becau&s;e &s;he had any well-grounded rea&s;ons for it, but becau&s;e it was much more plea&s;ing to hope than to fear.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="265">Sophia, when &s;he &s;aw her next, found her &s;ur|pri&s;ingly altered: &s;he not only no longer oppo&s;ed her going, but even &s;eemed de&s;irous of it; and this &s;he thought a ma&s;ter-piece of cunning which could not fail of gaining Mr. Herbert's good opinion; never once reflecting that her former oppo&s;ition de|prived her of all the merit of a voluntary com|pliance.</P>
<P>This change in Mrs. Darnley left Sophia no more difficulties to encounter but what &s;he found in her own heart. Indu&s;trious to deceive her&s;elf, &s;he had imputed all the unea&s;y emotions there to the grief of leaving her mother contrary to her incli|nation: &s;he had now her free con&s;ent to go, yet &s;till tho&s;e perturbations remained. She thanked her mother for her indulgence: &s;he took her hand, and tenderly pre&s;&s;ed it to her lips, tears at the &s;ame time flowing fa&s;t from her eyes.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley was cruel enough to &s;hew that &s;he under&s;tood the cau&s;e of this hidden pa&s;&s;ion.
<Q>What, &s;aid &s;he, to the poor blu&s;hing Sophia, after all the clutter you have made about leaving Sir Charles, does your heart fail you, now you come to the trial?</Q></P>
<P>Sophia, aba&s;hed and &s;ilent, hid her glowing face with her handkerchief; and having with &s;ome dif|ficulty repre&s;t another gu&s;h of tears, a&s;&s;umed com|po&s;ure enough to tell her mother that &s;he hoped &s;he &s;hould never want fortitude to do her duty.</P>
<P><Q>To be &s;ure, replied Mrs. Darnely, with a &s;neer, one &s;o wi&s;e as you can never mi&s;take your duty.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Sophia however under&s;tood hers &s;o well that &s;he did not offer to recriminate upon this occa|&s;ion;
<PB N="250" REF="266">
for Mrs. Darnley was but a &s;hallow politician, and was thrown &s;o much off her guard by the vex|ation &s;he felt, that an affair on which &s;he built &s;uch great hopes had taken &s;o different a turn, that &s;he gave plain indications of her di&s;plea&s;ure, and that her con&s;ent to her daughter's going was indeed ex|torted from her.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia had many of the&s;e a&s;&s;aults to &s;u&s;tain, as well from Harriot as Mrs. Darnley, during the re|mainder of that day; but they were of &s;ervice to her. Her pride was concerned to prevent giving a real cau&s;e for &s;uch &s;arca&s;ms as her &s;i&s;ter in particular threw out: oppo&s;ition kept up her &s;pirits, and pre|&s;erved her mind from yielding to that tender grief which the idea of parting for ever from Sir Charles excited.</P>
<P>When Mr. Herbert came the next morning, Mrs. Darnley, who had no better part to play, had recour&s;e again to di&s;&s;imulation, and expre&s;&s;ed great willingne&s;s to &s;end her daughter away; but the good man, who &s;aw the feint in her overacted &s;atisfaction, &s;uffered her to imagine that &s;he had effectually impo&s;ed upon him.</P>
<P>Sophia wept when &s;he took leave of her mother, and returned the cold &s;alute her &s;i&s;ter gave her with an affectionate embrace. She &s;ighed deeply as Mr. Herbert helped her into the po&s;t-chai&s;e; and continued pen&s;ive and &s;ilent for &s;everal minutes, not daring to rai&s;e her eyes up to her kind conduc|tor, le&s;t he &s;hould read in them what pa&s;&s;ed in her heart.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, who gue&s;&s;ed what &s;he felt upon this occa&s;ion, was &s;en&s;ibly affected with that &s;oft melan|choly,
<PB N="251" REF="267">
&s;o ea&s;y to be di&s;covered in her countenance, notwith&s;tanding all her endeavours to conceal it. He wi&s;hed to comfort her, but the &s;ubject was too delicate to be mentioned: kind and indulgent as he was, he began to think his admired Sophia carried her concern on this occa&s;ion too far; &s;o true it is, that the ca&s;e of tried virtue is harder than that of untried: we require from it as debts continual ex|ertions of its power, and if we are at any time di&s;|appointed in our expectations, we blame with re|&s;entment as if we had been deceived.</P>
<P>Sophia's &s;en&s;ibility, however, was very excu&s;able; in flying from Sir Charles &s;he had done all that the mo&s;t rigid virtue could demand; for as yet &s;he had only &s;u&s;picions again&s;t him; and this man, who&s;e generous gift &s;he had returned with &s;ilent &s;corn, whom &s;he had avoided as an enemy, had hitherto behaved to her with all the tenderne&s;s of a lover, and all the benevolence of a friend. It was under that amiable idea that he now pre&s;ented him&s;elf to her imagination; her pride and her re&s;entment were appea&s;ed by the &s;acrifice &s;he had made in her abrupt departure, and every unkind thought of him was changed to tender regret for his lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, by not attempting to divert the cour&s;e of her reflections, &s;oon drew her out of her revery: his &s;ilence and re&s;erve fir&s;t intimated to her the impropriety of her behaviour. She immediately a&s;&s;umed her u&s;ual compo&s;ure, and during the re|mainder of their little journey, &s;he appeared as chearful and &s;erene as if nothing extraordinary had happened.</P>

<P><PB N="252" REF="270">The good curate with whom &s;he was to lodge having rode out to meet his friend and his fair gue&s;t, joined them when they had come within three miles of his hou&s;e. Mr. Herbert, who had de&s;cried him at a little di&s;tance, &s;hewed him to So|phia:
<Q>There, my dear, &s;aid he, is a man who with more piety and learning than would &s;erve to make ten bi&s;hops is obliged to hire him&s;elf out at the rate of &s;ixty pounds a year, to do the duty of the pari&s;h-church, the rector of which enjoys three lucrative benefices, without praying or preaching above five times in a twelvemonth.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Law&s;on, for that was the curate's name, had now gallop'd up to the chai&s;e, which Mr. Herbert had ordered the po&s;t-boy to &s;top, and many kind &s;alutations pa&s;&s;ed between the two friends.</P>
<P>Sophia was particularly plea&s;ed with the candor and benevolence which appeared in the looks and behaviour of the good clergyman; who gazed on her attentively, and found the good opinion he had entertained of her from Mr. Herbert's repre&s;en|tations fully confirmed. The bewitching &s;weetne&s;s in her voice and eyes, the &s;pirit that animated her looks, and the peculiar elegance of her addre&s;s, produced their u&s;ual effects, and filled Mr. Law&s;on's heart with &s;entiments of tenderne&s;s, e&s;teem, and re&s;pect for her.</P>
<P>Mrs. Law&s;on and her two daughters received her with that true politene&s;s which is founded on good &s;en&s;e and good nature. Both the young wo|men were extremely agreeable in their per&s;ons, and Sophia contemplated with admiration the neat &s;im|plicity
<PB N="253" REF="271">
of their dre&s;s, their artle&s;s beauty, and native &s;weetne&s;s of manners. Health died their cheeks with blu&s;hes more beautiful than tho&s;e the fine lady bor|rows from paint; innocence and chearfulne&s;s lighted up &s;miles in their faces, as powerful as tho&s;e of the mo&s;t fini&s;hed coquet; and good humour and a &s;in|cere de&s;ire of obliging, gave graces to their beha|viour which ceremony but poorly imitates.</P>
<P>The&s;e were Sophia's ob&s;ervations to Mr. Her|bert, who &s;eized the fir&s;t opportunity of &s;peaking to her apart, to a&s;k her opinion of her new compa|nions. He was rejoiced to hear her expre&s;s great &s;atisfaction in her new &s;ituation, and not doubting but time and ab&s;ence, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by her own good &s;en&s;e and virtue, would bani&s;h Sir Charles Stan|ley entirely from her remembrance; he &s;crupled not to leave her at the end of three days, after hav|ing tenderly recommended her to the care of this little worthy family, every individual of which already loved her with extreme affection.</P>
<P>Sophia was indeed &s;o much delighted with the new &s;cene of life &s;he had entered upon, and her fancy was at fir&s;t &s;o &s;truck with the novelty of all the objects &s;he beheld, that the continual di&s;&s;ipa|tion of her thoughts left no room for the idea of the baronet: but this deceitful calm la&s;ted not long. She &s;oon found by experience, that the &s;i|lence and &s;olitude of the country were more pro|per to nouri&s;h love than to de&s;troy it; and that groves and meads, the nightingale's &s;ong, and the rivulet's murmur, were food for tender melan|choly.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="272">Mt. Law&s;on's hou&s;e was mo&s;t romanticly &s;itu|ated on the borders of a &s;pacious park; from who&s;e opulent owner he rented a &s;mall farm, which &s;upplied his family with almo&s;t all the nece&s;&s;aries of life. Mrs. Law&s;on his wife, brought him a very &s;mall fortune, but a great &s;tock of virtue, good &s;en&s;e, and prudence. She had &s;een enough of the world to poli&s;h her manners without cor|rupting her heart; and having lived mo&s;t part of her time in the country, &s;he under&s;tood rural af|fairs perfectly well, and &s;uperintended all the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of their little farm. Their two daughters were at once the be&s;t hou&s;e-wifes, and the mo&s;t accom|pli&s;hed young women in that part of the country. Mr. Law&s;on took upon him&s;elf the delightful ta&s;k of improving their minds, and giving them a ta&s;te for u&s;eful knowledge: and their mother, be&s;ides in&s;tructing them in all the economical duties &s;uit|able to their humble fortunes, formed them to tho&s;e decencies of manners and propriety of beha|viour, which &s;he had acquired by a genteel educa|tion, and the conver&s;ation of per&s;ons of rank. In the affairs of the family, each of the young wo|men had their particular province a&s;&s;igned them. Dolly, the elde&s;t, pre&s;ided in the dairy; and Fan|ny, &s;o was the younge&s;t called, a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the ma|nagement of the hou&s;e. Sophia &s;oon entertained a friend&s;hip for them both; but a powerful incli|nation attached her particularly to Dolly. There was in the countenance of this young woman a cer|tain &s;weetne&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility that plea&s;ed Sophia extremely; and though &s;he had all that chearful|ne&s;s which youth, health, and innocence in&s;pire,
<PB N="255" REF="273">
yet the pen&s;ivene&s;s that would &s;ometimes &s;teal over her &s;weet features, the gentle &s;ighs that would now and then e&s;cape her, excited a partial tender|ne&s;s for her in the heart of Sophia.</P>
<P>She took plea&s;ure in a&s;&s;i&s;ting her in her little employments. Dolly in&s;en&s;ibly lo&s;t that care which the pre&s;ence of the fair Londoner fir&s;t in&s;pir|ed, and repaid her tenderne&s;s with all that warmth of affection which only young and innocent minds are capable of feeling.</P>
<P>Sophia, in&s;tructed by her own experience, &s;oon di&s;covered that her young friend was in love; but neither of them di&s;clo&s;ed the &s;ecret of their hearts to each other. Dolly was with-held by ba&s;hful timidity, Sophia by delicate re&s;erve. Fond as they were of each other's company, yet the want of this mutual confidence made them &s;ometimes chu&s;e to be alone. Sophia having one evening &s;trayed in the wood, wholly ab&s;orbed in melancholy thoughts, lo&s;t her way, and was in &s;ome perplexity how to recover the path that led to Mr. Law&s;on's hou&s;e; when looking anxiou&s;ly around her, &s;he &s;aw Dolly at a di&s;tance, &s;itting under a tree. Over|joyed to meet her &s;o luckily, &s;he was running up to her, but &s;topped upon the appearance of a young man, who, &s;eeing Dolly, flew towards her with the utmo&s;t eagerne&s;s, and with &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion of joyful &s;urprize in his countenance as per&s;uaded her this meeting was accidental.</P>
<P>Sophia, not willing to interrupt their conver&s;a|tion, pa&s;&s;ed on &s;oftly behind the trees, unob&s;erved by Dolly, who continued in the &s;ame pen&s;ive atti|tude;
<PB N="256" REF="274">
but being now nearer to her, &s;he perceived &s;he was weeping exce&s;&s;ively.</P>
<P>Sophia, who was greatly affected at this &s;ight, could not help accompanying her tears with &s;ome of her own; and not daring to &s;tir a &s;tep farther for fear of being &s;een by the youth, &s;he re&s;olved to take advantage of her &s;ituation, to know the occa|&s;ion of Dolly's extraordinary affliction.</P>
<P>The poor girl was &s;o wrapt in thought, that &s;he neither &s;aw nor heard the approach of her lover, who called to her in the tendere&s;t accent imagin|able, "My dear Dolly, is it you? Won't you look at me? Won't you &s;peak to me? What have I done to make you angry, my love? Dont go (for upon hearing his voice &s;he &s;tarted from her &s;eat, and &s;eemed de&s;irous to avoid him) don't go, my dear Dolly, &s;aid he, following her (and &s;he went &s;lowly enough) don't drive me to de&s;pair."</P>
<P>"What would you have me do, Mr. William, &s;aid &s;he, &s;topping and turning gently towards him, you know my father has forbid me to &s;peak to you, and I would die rather than di&s;oblige him: you may thank your proud rich aunt for all this. Pray let me go, pur&s;ued &s;he, making &s;ome faint efforts to withdraw her hand, which he had &s;eized and held fa&s;t in his, you mu&s;t forget me, William, as I have re&s;olved to forget you," added &s;he &s;ighing, and turning away her head le&s;t he &s;hould &s;ee the tears that fell from her eyes.</P>
<P>Cruel as the&s;e words founded in the ears of the pa&s;&s;ionate William, yet he found &s;omething in her voice and actions that comforted him; "No, my dear Dolly, &s;aid he, endeavouring to look in her averted
<PB N="257" REF="275">
face, I will not believe that you have re&s;olved to forget me; you can no more forget me than I can you, and I &s;hall love you as long as I live&mdash;I know you &s;ay this only to grieve me; you do not mean it."</P>
<P>"Yes I do mean it, replied Dolly, in a peevi&s;h accent, vexed that he had &s;een her tears. I know my duty, and you &s;hall find that I can obey my father." While &s;he &s;poke this, &s;he &s;truggled &s;o much in earne&s;t to free her hand from his, that fearing to offend her, he dropped it with a &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive air.</P>
<P>Dolly having now no pretence for &s;taying any longer, bid him farewell in a faltering voice, and went on, tho' with a &s;low pace, towards her father's hou&s;e. The youth continued for a moment motion|le&s;s as a &s;tatue, with a countenance as pale as death, and his eyes, which were &s;uffu&s;ed with tears, fixed on the parting virgin.</P>
<P><Q>What, cried he at la&s;t, in the mo&s;t plaintive tone imaginable, can you really leave me thus? go then, my dear unkind Dolly, I will trouble you no more with my hateful pre&s;ence; I wi&s;h you happy, but if you hear that any &s;trange mi&s;chief has befallen me, be a&s;&s;ured you are the cau&s;e of it.</Q></P>
<P>He followed her as he &s;poke, and Dolly no longer able to continue her a&s;&s;umed rigour, &s;topped when he approached her, and bur&s;t into tears. The lover felt all his hopes revive at this &s;ight, and ta|king her hand, which he killed a thou&s;and times, he uttered the tendere&s;t vows of love and con&s;tancy; to which &s;he li&s;tened in &s;ilence, only now and then
<PB N="258" REF="276">
&s;oftly &s;ighing; at length &s;he di&s;engaged her hand, and gently begged him to leave her, le&s;t he &s;hould be &s;een by any of the family. The happy youth, once more convinced of her affection for him, obeyed without a murmur.</P>
<P>Dolly, as &s;oon as he had quitted her, ran ha&s;tily towards home; but he, as if every &s;tep was leading him to his grave, moved &s;lowly on, often looking back, and often &s;topping: &s;o that Sophia who was afraid &s;he would not be able to overtake her friend, was obliged to hazard being &s;een by him, and fol|lowed Dolly with all the &s;peed &s;he could.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he was near enough to be heard &s;he called out to her to &s;tay. Dolly &s;topt, but was in &s;o much confu&s;ion at the thought of having been &s;een by Mi&s;s Darnley, with her lover, that &s;he had not courage to go and meet her.
<Q>Ah Mi&s;s Dolly, &s;aid Sophia &s;miling, I have made a di&s;covery; but I do a&s;&s;ure you it was as accidental as your meeting with that hand&s;ome youth, who I find is your lover.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Yes, indeed, replied Dolly, who&s;e face was covered with blu&s;hes, my meeting with that young man was not de&s;igned, at lea&s;t on my part: but &s;urely you je&s;t, Mi&s;s Darnley, when you call him hand&s;ome: do you really think him hand|&s;ome?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Upon my word I do, &s;aid Sophia; he is one of the prettie&s;t youths I ever &s;aw; and if the pro|fe&s;&s;ions of men may be relied on, added &s;he, with a &s;igh, he certainly loves you; but, my dear Dolly, by what I could learn from your conver|&s;ation, he has not your father's con&s;ent to make
<PB N="259" REF="277">
his addre&s;&s;es to you; I was &s;orry to hear that, Dolly, becau&s;e I perceive, my dear, that you like him.</Q></P>
<P>Dolly now held down her head, and blu&s;hed more than before, but continued &s;ilent.
<Q>Perhaps you will think me impertinent, re&s;umed Sophia, for &s;peaking &s;o freely about your affairs; but I love you dearly, Mi&s;s Dolly.</Q>&mdash;
<Q>And I, interupted Dolly, throwing one of her arms about Sophia's neck, and ki&s;&s;ing her cheek, love you, Mi&s;s Darn|ley, better a thou&s;and times than ever I loved any body, except my father and mother and &s;i&s;ter.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Well, well, &s;aid Sophia, I won't di&s;pute that point with you now; but if you love me &s;o much as you &s;ay, my dear Dolly, why have you made a &s;ecret of this affair? friends do not u&s;e to be &s;o re&s;erved with each other.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Perhaps, &s;aid Dolly, &s;miling a little archly, you have taught me to be re&s;erved by your ex|ample; but indeed, added &s;he, with a graver look and accent, I am not worthy to be your confidant; you are my &s;uperior in every thing: It would be pre&s;umption in me to de&s;ire to know your &s;ecrets.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You &s;hall know every thing that concerns me, interupted Sophia, which can be of u&s;e to you, and add weight to that advice I &s;hall take the liberty to give you upon this occa&s;ion: I am far from being happy, my dear Dolly, and I blu&s;h to &s;ay it; it has been in the power of a deceitful man greatly to di&s;turb my peace.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia here wiped her charming eyes, and Dolly who wept &s;ympathetically for her, and for her&s;elf,
<PB N="260" REF="278">
exclaimed,
<Q>Is there a man in the world who could be fal&s;e to you? alas! what have I to expect?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Come, my dear, &s;aid Sophia, leading her to the root of a large tree, let us &s;it down here, we &s;hall not be called to &s;upper yet, you have time enough to give me &s;ome account of this young man, whom I &s;hould be glad to find worthy of you: tell me how your acquaintance began, and what are your father's rea&s;ons for forbidding your cor|re&s;pondence.</Q></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE lately been at one of the mo&s;t awful &s;olemnities in this kingdom, or perhaps in any kingdom in the world; the trial of a peer of England for felony and murder. The more attrocious the crime, or the more dignified the criminal, the higher mu&s;t curio&s;ity be rai&s;ed in every brea&s;t. Having a de&s;ire not to lo&s;e any cir|cum&s;tance of the behaviour of the &s;everal noble actors in this deep tragedy, I placed my&s;elf early on Wedne&s;day morning in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, in a &s;itu|ation that at once might allow me a &s;ight of the pri&s;oner, his coun&s;el, and particularly of his great and right honourable judges. I know full well the duty which I owe to the &s;upreme court of judicature, at who&s;e bar the pri&s;oner &s;tood arraigned; nor &s;hall I even by any iota, or much le&s;s by any inuendo, break in upon the privileges, which they &s;o ju&s;tly a&s;&s;ume of making their own proceedings &s;acred and invulnerable to improper publications, and the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of too bold, I will not venture to &s;ay too free a pre&s;s; yet &s;urely I may, nay, I mu&s;t declare, that this high court of judicature did upon this, as in every other point, and upon
<PB N="262" REF="281">
every other occa&s;ion, act like it&s;elf. All the &s;pecta|tors, who were &s;plendidly numerous of both &s;exes, &s;aw, heard, and confe&s;&s;ed that ju&s;tice was conco|mitant with mercy, enquiry was diverted of rigour, indulgence appeared without conde&s;cen&s;ion, huma|nity di&s;played it&s;elf without weakne&s;s, judgment without partiality, and uprightne&s;s without &s;eve|rity.</P>
<P>About eleven o'clock in the morning, as &s;oon as the peers, with the lord high &s;teward <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Keeper Henley.</NOTE> at their head, were &s;ituated in their order, and rank of place, lord Ferrers was brought to the bar. But what &s;hall I &s;ay of this unfortunate nobleman? He had neither dignity in his countenance, nor &s;ufficient graceful|ne&s;s in his manner to draw companion on his mi|&s;ery, or reverence to his per&s;on: down-ca&s;t eyes, an unmeaning face, a low &s;tature, rather de&s;pi|cable than a gentleman-like appearance, mu&s;t in all other circum&s;tances and &s;ituations have drawn a bia&s;s again&s;t him, and mu&s;t have compelled his beholders, on the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion, to have pro|nounced him an ill-favoured di&s;agreeable-looking man.</P>
<P>Placed at the bar of We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, a mi&s;era|ble helple&s;s pri&s;oner, <HI>with all his crimes upon his head,</HI> we naturally rejected the prejudices that were ari&s;ing again&s;t his outward demeanour, and joined with the clerk of the crown, in wi&s;hing that <HI>God might &s;end him a good deliverance</HI></P>
<P>The &s;everal particulars of the attrocious crime for which his lord&s;hip is to &s;uffer, will appear in
<PB N="263" REF="282">
the printed trial; they will appear, I am afraid, &s;hocking and barbarous. The trials of the Old Baily have &s;carce produced a parallel. It was a murder planned, concerted, and executed with deliberation, cruelty, and determined malice. Nei|ther drunkenne&s;s nor madne&s;s excited the imme|diate execution of it. Several per&s;ons were &s;ent out of the way, on purpo&s;e to leave the wretched victim beyond a po&s;&s;ibility of a&s;&s;i&s;tance or re&s;cue. The poor man was defencele&s;s, without arms, and even without the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of his fate. He was locked into the parlour by the inhuman earl, was compelled to kneel down on one knee, and in that po&s;ture was &s;hot, the ball remaining in his body. A glimp&s;e of repenting humanity then took place. The earl fir&s;t cau&s;ed him to be carried and put into a bed, and then &s;ent for a &s;urgeon to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his agony. But &s;oon after the arrival of the &s;ur|geon, all humanity vani&s;hed, a fre&s;h bla&s;t of fury aro&s;e, and it was with difficulty that his lord&s;hip could be hindered from tearing the agonizing Mr. John&s;on <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His name was William John&s;on; he had been many years in the family.</NOTE> out of bed, dragging him on the floor, and putting the fini&s;hing &s;troke to a life already ga&s;ping out its la&s;t painful moments. Here in|deed was the excu&s;e of ebriety. The earl by this time had dozed him&s;elf, by brandy, into all the heat of rage and violence: from brandy he de|&s;cended to Port wine, and continued drinking till nature was &s;ufficiently drowned by liquor to &s;ink into a &s;ound &s;leep, and a temporary oblivion of the
<PB N="264" REF="283">
horrid action which he had committed. Poor John&s;on, terrified to be under the roof of his mur|derer, was by his earne&s;t de&s;ire carried to his own hou&s;e, where, in a few hours, he expired, amid&s;t the tears and lamentations of his mi&s;erable family.</P>
<P>It was a mo&s;t affecting part of the trial to &s;ee Mi&s;s John&s;on, daughter of the decea&s;ed, dre&s;&s;ed in mourning, and giving te&s;timony of her father's cata&s;trophe.</P>
<P>All compa&s;&s;ion towards the earl is much curbed, if not totally &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, when we con&s;ider the mi|&s;erable &s;ituatibn into which this unhappy family is thrown. Yet I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I found my&s;elf deeply moved when the earl gave in that paper of his defence, which with great unea&s;ine&s;s he urged as the &s;tronge&s;t, perhaps the only plea in his fa|vour.
<Q>I am, &s;aid he, importuned, and indeed con&s;trained, my lords, by my family, to plead to your lord&s;hips, by way of mitigation and ex|cu&s;e of my crime, the unhappy &s;tate of mind under which I frequently labour, and with which I mu&s;t have been particularly vi&s;ited when I committed the crime that has been laid open to your lord&s;hips.</Q>
Words to this purpo&s;e were pronounced by him in the greate&s;t perturbation of &s;pirit, in a confu&s;ion and unea&s;ine&s;s not to be de|&s;cribed, and with a difficulty of re&s;piration that evidently di&s;covered the inward workings of his &s;oul. Unhappy man! could he have proved that he had committed the murder whil&s;t he was vi&s;ited by the &s;ore&s;t di&s;ea&s;e to which human nature is lia|ble,
<PB N="265" REF="284">
death would not have been his portion. But even his own witne&s;&s;es te&s;tified his intervals of &s;anity to have been too many, and too con&s;tant to admit of any &s;uch plea. The earl was indulged in producing any witne&s;&s;es to the purpo&s;e he de|&s;ired: two were heard, but the evening coming on, the trial was adjourned till next day.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day afternoon, the noble judges came into We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall. The earl pur&s;ued his plea of lunacy, and to that purport examined a fre&s;h &s;tring of witne&s;&s;es, nine, I think, in number, of which two were his own brothers. This &s;eem|ed to me, and probably to mo&s;t of the audience, a very &s;hocking &s;cene; a noble family expo&s;ed, per&s;ons long &s;ince in their graves conjured up, like gho&s;ts, only to be proved lunatics; younger brothers, as an in&s;tance of the &s;tronge&s;t fraternal affection, endeavouring to denounce their elder brother mad. Relations, acquaintance, and even &s;ervants, giving various in&s;tances of the earl's frenzy; wildne&s;s and di&s;traction. Yet all to no purpo&s;e. None of the&s;e in&s;tances came up to the point.</P>
<P>The unfortunate pri&s;oner might have been &s;ometimes wild, &s;ometimes frantic, but never to|tally deprived of &s;en&s;e. John&s;on was killed in an hour of &s;anity. John&s;on fell by malice prepen&s;e. A &s;hort &s;peech concluded all the earl had to &s;ay: it was read by the clerk of the hou&s;e of lords, and was evidently a compo&s;ition as well put together as if the author of it had never, in the whole of his life-time, been vi&s;ited by the lea&s;t degree of mad|ne&s;s.
<PB N="266" REF="285">
The coun&s;el for the crown <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The attorney and &s;ollicitor general; the former had opened the nature of the evidence, the latter concluded it.</NOTE> then &s;ummed up, and ob&s;erved upon the whole evidence, and ended as they began, in the mo&s;t tender, clear, im|partial, generous, but ju&s;t manner, that nature could demon&s;trate, or human abilities di&s;play.</P>
<P>The lords returned to the parliament-chamber, and after &s;ome time came back to We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall, where each of their lord&s;hips &s;everally, and for him&s;elf, pronounced earl Ferrers, <HI>guilty of the felony and murder of which he &s;tood indicted</HI></P>
<P>The number of peers who gave their votes were one hundred and &s;ixteen, twenty one bi&s;hops, and four temporal lords being ab&s;ent at the time when lord Ferrers received his doom. The number of &s;piritual and temporal lords who attended the fir&s;t day, were one hundred and forty one. The num|ber happened to be exactly the &s;ame as had attend|ed lord Lovat's trial. The pri&s;oner was then &s;ummoned to the bar, the judgment of the lords was declared to him, and as he was to receive &s;en|tence of death the next day, he was immediately remanded to the Tower.</P>
<P>The lords came into We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall about noon on Friday, and Laurence earl Ferrers was a&s;ked, according to the u&s;ual form, <HI>Why judgment of death &s;hould not pa&s;s upon him, according to law?</HI> His lord&s;hip produced a written &s;peech, which was read by the clerk, and was drawn up in a mo&s;t proper decent manner, &s;till regretting the plea he
<PB N="267" REF="286">
had been forced to offer of lunacy, and &s;ubmitting entirely to the judgment of the hou&s;e of peers.</P>
<P>The lord high &s;teward then pronounced his &s;en|tence, having introduced it by a mo&s;t proper exor|dium. The &s;entence was, that <HI>earl Ferrers &s;hould be hanged till he was dead, and his body &s;hould be deli|vered to the &s;urgeons to be anatomized</HI> When he heard the &s;entence of hanging pronounced, he &s;aid, in a low voice, <HI>God's will be done;</HI> but when he heard he was to be anatomized, he &s;aid, with great emotion, <HI>God forbid;</HI> however, both parts of the &s;entence mu&s;t be ab&s;olutely fulfilled. The law that enacts it pa&s;&s;ed no longer ago than the year 1752, and has no re&s;pect of per&s;ons; not even the king can commute the &s;entence. His maje&s;ty may re|prieve from time to time, or he may pardon, but his maje&s;ty cannot alter the letter of the law. All the indulgence within the power of the lords in their legi&s;lative capacity was &s;hewn to the pri&s;oner; without that indulgence he mu&s;t have been hanged on Monday the twenty-fir&s;t in&s;tant, and till his ex|ecution, mu&s;t have been &s;u&s;tained &s;olely by bread and water, nor could any per&s;on be permitted to conver&s;e with him: in&s;tead of the&s;e &s;everities (by a power ve&s;ted in the judges of the court where the felon is tried) his death is po&s;tponed to the fifth of May, and his diet and manner of cu&s;tody are entirely left to the di&s;cretion of the noble lord who pre&s;ides <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charles, earl Cornwallis.</NOTE> over the pri&s;oners in the Tower, to their great happine&s;s, and to his own great honour.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="287">Thus concluded the trial of Lawrence earl Fer|rers, who drew upon him&s;elf his own di&s;mal cata|&s;trophe. Here let us clo&s;e the &s;cene, but not without remembring, that the la&s;t trial of any peer for murder was in the year 1699, above three&s;core years ago, when Edward, earl of Warwick and Holland, and Charles lord Mohun, were each &s;e|verally tried for the murder of Richard Coote, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Lord Warwick was found guilty of man&s;laughter; lord Mohun was entirely acquitted. Lord War|wick claimed and received the benefit of his pee|rage, upon the &s;tatute of Edward VI. Lord Mo|hun (who in the year 1692 had been tried and ac|quitted, for the murder of Mr. Mountford the player) towards the latter part of queen Anne's reign, ended his life in a duel with the duke of Ha|milton in Hyde-park.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I &s;ent you an account of the trial and condemnation of Lawrence, late earl Ferrers, I did not imagine that I &s;hould have been enabled to add to it an account of his execution; but my curio&s;ity having conquered all other &s;en&s;a|tions, I was pre&s;ent at the cata&s;trophe of that nobleman.</P>
<P>The particulars of his lord&s;hip's behaviour from the Tower to the place of execution, are publi&s;hed by order or permi&s;&s;ion of the &s;heriffs. To repeat tho&s;e particulars would be needle&s;s; but give me leave, madam, by way of po&s;t&s;cript to my la&s;t let|ter, to animadvert upon &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of the earl's appearance and demeanour, which, except in one in&s;tance, drew pity and compa&s;&s;ion from all the &s;pec|tators. The in&s;tance I hint at, was his lord&s;hip's dre&s;s, of which he him&s;elf took notice to Mr. &s;heriff Vaillant. <HI>You may perhaps, Sir,</HI> &s;aid the earl, <HI>think it &s;trange to &s;ee me in this dre&s;s, but I have my particular rea&s;ons for it</HI> Mr. Vaillant pre&s;t not to know tho&s;e particular rea&s;ons, and they &s;eemingly died with the noble criminal.</P>
<P>But <HI>the people,</HI> ever bu&s;y and inqui&s;itive to fathom the deepe&s;t &s;ecrets, and to expo&s;e to light the mo&s;t inward rece&s;&s;es of the &s;oul, have loudly and una|nimou&s;ly declared, that the clothes which the earl
<PB N="270" REF="289">
wore, light cloth embroidered with &s;ilver, was the &s;uit in which he was married, and that his lord&s;hip dated the &s;ource of his misfortunes from the day of his marriage. Unhappy wretched man! filled with whim, error, &s;u&s;picions, malevolence, and a kind of in&s;ult, by no means to be excu&s;ed, except as proceeding from a depraved imagination. At his trial, he had brought in his plea of lunacy. By his dre&s;s, he appeared to continue on that plea at the gal|lows. He forgave the executioner, he forgave all the world, but as he &s;eems to have been a kind of fatali&s;t, he forgave not his fate, which, according to his own wild imagination, led him by a &s;uit of clothes to his ruin.</P>
<P>How erroneou&s;ly do the thoughts &s;tray, and how irregular and tempe&s;tuous are the pa&s;&s;ions, when the &s;eat of &s;en&s;e and judgment is ever &s;o little di&s;|located? or when the cool calm dictates of the chri&s;tian religion are thrown a&s;ide or trampled upon?</P>
<P>The printed account continues to &s;ay, that <HI>his lord&s;hip asked the &s;heriff, if he had ever &s;een &s;o great a concour&s;e of people before? and upon his an&s;wering that he had not; I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;aid his lord&s;hip, it is becau&s;e they never &s;aw a lord hanged before</HI> It is certain that no lord within the memory of the pre&s;ent age, had undergone the &s;ame cata&s;trophe as was allotted to earl Ferrers. The executions of noblemen, during a great length of time, had been always per|formed by beheading, &s;ometimes within the Tower gates, &s;ometimes upon Tower-hill. In the reign of queen Mary the fir&s;t, a lord was hanged at Sa|lisbury. One peer only had ever preceded lord Ferrers at Tyburn, and as he was executed above
<PB N="271" REF="290">
four hundred years ago, his lord&s;hip was almo&s;t forgotten, although very particularly mentioned by mo&s;t, if not all of our Engli&s;h hi&s;torians. They inform us, that Roger Mortimer, earl of March, was treated with the utmo&s;t rigour; his impeach|ment, &s;ays Rapin, was brought before the parlia|ment. By the expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>brought before the parlia|ment,</HI> I pre&s;ume the author means, that the com|mons had brought up an impeachment again&s;t him to the bar of the hou&s;e of lords. The earl of March's crimes had long been &s;o notorious and ar|bitrary, that he was condemned to die without any evidence being called to witne&s;s again&s;t him. It mu&s;t have appeared therefore that the articles of his impeachment were univer&s;ally known and ac|knowledged to be true, and the weight of them &s;upplied every other evidence that could be want|ed. How different were tho&s;e times from the&s;e? Now, the meane&s;t &s;ubject in the kingdom knows that when he is tried for his life, he cannot be tried but by the &s;tricte&s;t, the faire&s;t, and the minute&s;t rules of equity, law, and ju&s;tice. Then, the highe&s;t peer in the realm might be hurried and per|&s;ecuted to his death, without any other legal autho|rity than the outcry of the people, and the violence of an enraged parliament. Roger Mortimer, earl of March, was hanged on the common gallows at Tyburn, November 29, 1330, in the reign of Edward the third. The place of execution was then called Elms, his body continued hanging two days and two nights; a &s;pectacle probably intended for the populace, who had ju&s;tly held him in the ut|mo&s;t degree of abhorrence.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="291">As the unfortunate earl Ferrers has not only paid the debt of nature, but of the law, humanity ought to di&s;po&s;e us to believe his lord&s;hip's a&s;&s;everation, that he had not entertained the lea&s;t malice again&s;t Mr. John&s;on, whom he murdered. The rea&s;ons which he gave, &s;upport his lord&s;hip's a&s;&s;ertion. <HI>I was,</HI> &s;aid the earl, <HI>under particular circum&s;tances, I had met with &s;o many cro&s;&s;es and vexations that I &s;carce knew what I did</HI> Where vexations and di&s;|appointments, joined to a lunatic di&s;po&s;ition, affect the mind they often pervert the temper from chear|fulne&s;s to melancholy, from freedom to &s;u&s;picions, from calmne&s;s to rage, acrimony, and revenge. The blood becomes black and bilious, &s;trange thoughts ari&s;e, continual unea&s;ine&s;s &s;ucceeds, ra&s;h actions follow, cruelties, murders, and &s;uicide. Ah! wretched human kind! more wretched than the bea&s;ts of the field, more de&s;picable than the reptiles of the earth; if deprived of rea&s;on, &s;ubject to lunacy, and vi&s;ited by returning fits of madne&s;s.</P>
<P>Here let me clo&s;e the &s;cene, and only add that earl Ferrers died a chri&s;tian without knowing that he was &s;uch. He devoutly repeated the Lord's Prayer, and his la&s;t words to the executioner were, <HI>I freely forgive you as I do all mankind, and hope my|&s;elf to be forgiven</HI> He would have died an hero, had he expired in a virtuous cau&s;e; for, according to the &s;heriff's paper, <HI>From the time of his lord&s;hip's a&s;cending the &s;caffold until his execution, his countenance did not change nor his tongue faulter. The pro&s;pect of death did not at all &s;hake the compo&s;ure of his mind.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ESSAY ON THE Original Inhabitants of GREAT BRITAIN CONTINUED.</HEAD>
<P>FROM this time may be dated the &s;ubjection of our i&s;land to the Roman emperors, or, more properly perhaps, to their legates, and pro|praetors. It is true, that the greater part of the i&s;land yet remained unconquered; but the defeat of Caractacus, and the con&s;tant torrent of &s;ucce&s;s with which the Romans bore down all who re|&s;i&s;ted them, had at lea&s;t &s;truck an univer&s;al con|&s;ternation, if not a terror, throughout the whole nation. The aver&s;ion which every Briti&s;h prince bore to his neighbours was often greater than the love which he bore to his country: the pa&s;&s;ion of hatred being in general more violent, and of longer duration, than the pa&s;&s;ion of love. Thus Cari&s;|mantua betrayed Caractacus, not &s;o much from the motives of fear or treachery, as from a de&s;ire of gaining the protection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Romans again&s;t her hu&s;band Venutius and his whole family, whom &s;he held in the utmo&s;t dete&s;|tation.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="293">The behaviour of Caractacus at Rome, when led in triumph, and as a public &s;pectacle, was truly great. He appeared before the emperor with a decent, manly, compo&s;ed countenance; and if we are to believe Cornelius Tacitus, he made a &s;peech to this purpo&s;e:</P>
<P><HI>If in my pro&s;perity, the moderation of my conduct had been equivalent to my birth and fortune, I &s;hould have come into this city, not as a captive, but as a friend: nor would you, Cae&s;ar, have di&s;dained to have entered into an alliance with a man born of illu&s;trious ance&s;tors, and powerful in the command of many colo|nies. My pre&s;ent fate is to me di&s;honourable: to you magnificently glorious. I once had hor&s;es; I once had men; I once had arms; I once had riches. Can you wonder, if I have lo&s;t all the&s;e unwillingly? although, as Romans, you may aim at the conque&s;t of all mankind, it does not follow, that all mankind mu&s;t &s;ubmit to be your &s;laves. If I had immediately yielded without re|&s;i&s;tance, neither the perver&s;ene&s;s of my fortune, nor the glory of your triumph had been &s;o remarkable. Puni&s;h me with death, and I &s;hall be forgotten. Suffer me to live, and I &s;hall remain an eternal example of your clemency.</HI></P>
<P>Much &s;truck and awakened by the appearance of &s;uch a pri&s;oner, the emperor ordered the chains of Caractacus and his family to be taken off; and Agrippina, who was more than an equal a&s;&s;o|ciate in the empire, not only received the captive Britons with great marks of kindne&s;s and com|pa&s;&s;ion, but confirmed to them the enjoyment of their pre&s;ent liberty.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="294">During the remainder of Claudius Cae&s;ar's reign, the Romans and the Britons went on in the &s;ame offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive manner, which they had practi&s;ed for &s;ome years pa&s;t. Skirmi&s;h &s;ucceeded &s;kirmi&s;h. The victories were alternate; but the advantages were generally more on the Roman, than on the Briti&s;h &s;ide.</P>
<P>Nero, the &s;on of Agrippina, by her &s;econd hu&s;|band Caius Domitius Aenobarbus, &s;ucceeded Clau|dius, and a&s;cended the imperial throne. In the beginning of Nero's reign, the government of our i&s;land was conducted in the &s;ame tract that had been pur&s;ued for &s;ome years pa&s;t. Legate was &s;ent after legate: procurator followed procurator; and as the wealth of the i&s;land increa&s;ed, each go|vernor became more tyrannical and rapacious.</P>
<P>At the landing of the fir&s;t Cae&s;ar, the Britons were a people without riches, without commerce, without agriculture. At the acce&s;&s;ion of Nero, they were &s;ufficiently rich to pay the tributes im|po&s;ed upon them by the Romans: their pre&s;ent opulency aro&s;e from the number of their herds, from their experience in agriculture, and from the produce of their wool. Their herds of cattle were always numerous, and are mentioned as &s;uch by Cae&s;ar. Their improvements in agriculture were acquired by their intercour&s;e with the continent; and their wool was reckoned of &s;o fine a texture, that it was much e&s;teemed, and &s;ought after by foreigners. Our wool remains in the &s;ame degree of repute at this day.</P>
<P>From the defeat of Caractacus, the Britons were no longer looked upon as allies, but as tributary
<PB N="276" REF="295">
provincials to the empire of Rome: they were permitted indeed, in all controver&s;ies and rights, as were purely relative to them&s;elves, to be deter|mined by their own laws, and to be governed by their own princes; but in all public a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments, in levies for the army, and in many other in&s;tances, both the princes and the people, as far as the Roman arms had yet prevailed in the i&s;land, were equally &s;ubject to their conquerors. Their &s;itua|tion was particularly unhappy under Nero's go|vernment. The vices of that emperor &s;oon grew to &s;uch a height, that the riches of the whole earth were in&s;ufficient to an&s;wer his demands. Every kingdom, every province in the world was taxed with great rigour; but the taxations impo&s;ed upon the Britons were more &s;en&s;ibly grievous and oppre&s;|&s;ive. Their &s;tate of bondage grew &s;o very in|tolerable, that in the fifth year of Nero's reign, the Iceni, who&s;e queen Boadicea and her two daughters had been treated in a mo&s;t vicious, cruel, and ig|nominious manner, re&s;olved to ri&s;e up in arms again&s;t the Romans. The Iceni were joined by the Trinobantes; and both the&s;e colonies put them&s;elves under the command of the injured and outrageous Boadicea. Dio and Tacitus make the Briti&s;h army amount to an incredible number. There is no doubt that their forces were more nu|merous than had ever yet been a&s;&s;embled in Britain: and they judiciou&s;ly cho&s;e to make this bold effort for their laws and liberty, at a time when Paulinus Suetonius, the Roman governor of Britain, was engaged in an attempt upon
<PB N="277" REF="296">
Mona <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The i&s;le of Angle&s;ey, in North Wales.</NOTE>, and had withdrawn all his forces into that i&s;land.</P>
<P>Boadicea, and her army were, at fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful; but alas! how very intoxicating qualities has &s;uc|ce&s;s! The Briti&s;h heroine and her followers threw a&s;ide every &s;entiment of compa&s;&s;ion, and became more inhumanly &s;avage than their ance&s;tors in the time of Julius Cae&s;ar. Their actions, as re|lated by Dion Ca&s;&s;ius, are too &s;hocking to be re|lated. Let us pa&s;s over them in &s;ilence, and if po&s;&s;ible bury them in eternal oblivion.</P>
<P>Paulinus Suetonius, upon the alarm of &s;uch a &s;udden and extraordinary in&s;urrection, reimbarked his troops; and, without the lea&s;t lo&s;s of time, marched to London, which was then only inha|bited by merchants; but, as Tacitus informs us, was a city remarkably well &s;upplied with all kinds of provi&s;ions. Suetonius pre&s;&s;ed forward with un|wearied expedition, fully re&s;olved to take the earlie&s;t opportunity of forcing the enemy to a general battle. The exact &s;pot where the battle was fought is not known; but we are told, that Suetonius, by choo&s;ing a very advantageous piece of ground, and by drawing up his men with all the military conduct of an experienced commander, gained &s;o compleat a victory, that Tacitus equals it to any of the glorious conque&s;ts obtained by the antient Romans.</P>
<P>Boadicea, as Dio repre&s;ents her, was of a ma|je&s;tic pre&s;ence, of a ma&s;culine countenance, tall in &s;tature, with yellow hair.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="297">This unfortunate Thale&s;tris &s;eems to have been a woman of a mo&s;t intrepid &s;pirit, and of a peculiar pride and fiercene&s;s, amounting even to barbarity. It is certain that &s;he had received great injuries, &s;uch as might have provoked a milder di&s;po&s;ition: but &s;he had &s;hewn her&s;elf &s;o utterly void of pity, and had put in practice &s;uch cruelties again&s;t the Romans, that &s;he drew upon her own &s;ubjects in &s;ome degree an equal portion of revenge. Not a Briton received quarter: not even the women <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Britons were &s;o confident of victory, that they car|ried with them their wives, in waggons, which were plated on the outward borders of the field.</NOTE>, who had attended their hu&s;bands to the battle. Boadicea could not bear the thoughts of &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion: as &s;oon as the victory was determined, &s;he put an end to her life by poi&s;on; and this, I be|lieve, was the fir&s;t in&s;tance, in which the Romans &s;aw them&s;elves imitated in &s;uicide by a Briton; would to God it had been the la&s;t!</P>
<P>The Britons were now again &s;ubjected to the government, the di&s;po&s;al, and the tyranny of Rome. They remained &s;o during the reign of Nero, with|out any material alteration, except the unhappy con&s;equence taken notice of by Tacitus, who in his life of Agricola, &s;ays,
<Q>Even the&s;e barbarians began to reli&s;h now the &s;oftne&s;s of vice.</Q></P>
<P>What a bewitching power mu&s;t luxury po&s;&s;e&s;s when it becomes too mighty, not only for the greate&s;t fortitude, but the greate&s;t fiercene&s;s of mind?</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="298">The Roman emperors who alternatively &s;uc|ceeded Nero, were Galba, Otho, and Vitellius. Their reigns were &s;hort, and during that &s;pace of time &s;carce any alteration happened in the go|vernment of Britain.</P>
<P>To Ve&s;pe&s;ian and his &s;on Titus was re&s;erved the glory of making a greater progre&s;s towards the entire conque&s;t of the whole i&s;land than had been hitherto made by any of his predece&s;&s;ors. Wi&s;e princes chu&s;e wi&s;e mini&s;ters. Ve&s;pa&s;ian appointed Petilius Cerealis, Julius Frontinus, and Cnaeus Julius Agricola, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, to the government of Britain. They were three Romans of remarkable eminence, in dignity and reputation. The cha|racter of Agricola is drawn by his &s;on in law Cor|nelius Tacitus. It is the mo&s;t ma&s;terly perform|ance of that hi&s;torian's pencil. The picture is painted in the livelie&s;t and the &s;tronge&s;t colours, the attitudes are beautiful, and the outlines are ju&s;t.</P>
<P>Agricola re&s;ided near eight years in Britain. He was e&s;tabli&s;hed in that government by three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive emperors, Ve&s;pa&s;ian, and his two &s;ons Titus and Domitian <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ve&s;pa&s;ian died in about a twelvemonth after he had ap|pointed Agricola governor of Britain. Titus did only out-live his father three years, and was &s;ucceeded by his brother Domitian.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The political conduct of Agricola was not in the lea&s;t inferior to his military prowe&s;s. He found the Britons already yielding to the temptations of luxury. He artfully encrea&s;ed tho&s;e temptations.
<PB N="280" REF="299">
He introduced the &s;ciences of eloquence and ar|chitecture; and the i&s;landers were &s;o enchanted by the manners and cu&s;toms of their enemies, that they not only applied them&s;elves to learn the Ro|man language, but many of them even wore the Roman dre&s;s. It was a fortunate circum&s;tance to Agricola, that in the very earlie&s;t part of his life, he had &s;erved in Britain under the command of &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent Roman governors, par|cularly Paulinus Suetonius, and Petilius Cerealis, by both of whom he was per&s;onally e&s;teemed and di&s;tingui&s;hed: nor was it le&s;s fortunate, that he had dedicated that part of his youth to &s;peculative knowledge, and had diligently &s;tudied the genius and di&s;po&s;ition of our forefathers. He had already ob&s;erved, from experience, that the Britons were much more difficult to be forced than to be in|duced to yield. Genero&s;ity drew them into friend|&s;hip and compliance; &s;everity drove them into ob&s;tinacy and rebellion. They were extremely apt to imbibe and to imitate the manners of fo|reign nations. Tho&s;e who were neare&s;t to Gaul a&s;&s;umed the Gallic fa&s;hions and behaviour: and as the Romans were &s;till a politer people, their na|tional cu&s;toms and elegancies were again more ac|ceptable to the Britons; &s;o that in &s;ome few years after Agricola's arrival as governor, he had the pride and &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing the Roman por|ticos, their baths and other buildings of magni|ficence imitated, and in a manner transferred into various parts of Britain. Tacitus makes a very true ob&s;ervation upon the&s;e improvements. He &s;ays,
<Q>The ignorant looked upon this as the be|ginning
<PB N="281" REF="300">
of humanity; the wi&s;e knew it to be one of the chief roots of &s;lavery.</Q></P>
<P>But Agricola was, by no means, ab&s;olutely de|voted to the arts of peace. He made u&s;e of policy only at tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons, and in tho&s;e places, where he could not exert his military conduct. He knew that the natural fiercene&s;s of the nation was too great, and too univer&s;al to be entirely reduced by any arts but arms. He began, although he had landed very late in the &s;ummer <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A. U. C. 830.</NOTE>, by conquering the Ordovices; and as he had remembered them a perver&s;e, mutinous, ungovernable people, he al|mo&s;t de&s;troyed the whole colony: and then pro|ceeded to Mona, with a re&s;olution fully to com|plete the conque&s;t of that i&s;land. This was a work which had been intended by Paulinus Sue|tonius, but it was left unfini&s;hed, upon account of Boadicea's in&s;urrection.</P>
<P>Mona was originally inhabited by the Druids, and con&s;equently was held in a mo&s;t idolatrous veneration by the re&s;t of the Britons It is &s;epa|rated from the greater i&s;land by a very narrow channel. Suetonius had invaded it with &s;ome de|gree of &s;ucce&s;s. He had landed his &s;oldiers in flat-bottom boats, and had utterly de&s;troyed the temples, groves, and other places of wor&s;hip, which the Druids had dedicated to religious mur|ders, and to &s;acrifices of human victims. The&s;e holy &s;eers, who, unfortunately for mankind, pro|fe&s;&s;ed the art of divination, con&s;ulted the my&s;te|rious decrees of heaven, from the entrails of &s;uch
<PB N="282" REF="301">
ill-fated &s;trangers, who by &s;hipwreck, or any other accident, had been thrown upon their i&s;land; and from the&s;e impious rites, the Briti&s;h nation in ge|neral, was characterized as cruelly inho&s;pitable to &s;trangers.</P>
<P>The reduction of Mona was no very difficult ta&s;k. The Roman &s;oldiers &s;wam over the river Maene, a &s;ight that &s;truck &s;uch terror into the inhabitants <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The inhabitants now con&s;i&s;ted not only of Druids, but of the Ordovices, and other neighbouring colonies, who, from time to time, had e&s;caped from the pur&s;uit of the Romans, and had taken refuge within the i&s;land.</NOTE>, that they &s;urrendered the i&s;land with|out the lea&s;t attempt towards an oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The winter was employed by Agricola in an ad|mini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, throughout the &s;everal pro|vinces which he had conquered. He began by a &s;trict reformation in his own hou&s;hold and depen|dents. He proceeded to as &s;trict a di&s;qui&s;ition into the conduct and di&s;cipline of the army. He ex|cu&s;ed faults, but he never failed to puni&s;h crimes. He was &s;evere, but he was not cruel. He rather required than exacted taxes. He regulated the inequality of a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments, and by preventing all kinds of corruption, he &s;uffered no iniquitous im|po&s;itions to take place. He cho&s;e the obedience flowing from devotion, not the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion ari&s;ing from fear. In veneration of &s;uch virtues, a real attachment to his per&s;on, and an humble imitation of his conduct, univer&s;ally prevailed. His com|mon &s;oldiers became mode&s;t and regular: his chief officers generous and humane. The Britons found them&s;elves happy under his government.
<PB N="283" REF="302">
He was their ma&s;ter, not their tyrant; and they &s;o far complied wich his private advice and encou|ragement, e&s;pecially as he pretended no command over their particular oeconomy, that they began, as has been already hinted, to build hou&s;es, erect temples, and exhibit various edifices of public re&s;ort.</P>
<P>The winter and the &s;pring pa&s;&s;ed in works of this kind. Early in the &s;ummer, Agricola took the field. He made a farther progre&s;s into the i&s;land than had been attempted by any of his pre|dece&s;&s;ors. He marched northward, and con|quered the Brigantes and the Ottodini.</P>
<P>When he returned to his winter-quarters, he re|&s;umed his former plan of politics, and endea|voured to reconcile the ancient Britons, not only to the laws, the intere&s;t, and the power of the Roman Empire, but to the &s;everal refinements which the Romans had made in the more polite, or in truth, the more luxurious branches of their &s;tate.</P>
<P>The en&s;uing &s;ummer produced fre&s;h laurels to Agricola. He penetrated into Scotland, and he advanced as far as the Frith <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Frith &s;ignifies the mouth of a river.</NOTE> of Jay <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Jay is one of the chief rivers in Scotland: it i&s;&s;ues out of Loch Jay in Broadalbin, and running &s;outh-we&s;t, &s;ails into the &s;ea at Dundee.</NOTE>.

Tacitus &s;ays, that not one of the forts which had been erected by Agricola was ever
<PB N="284" REF="303">
taken, &s;urrendered, or abandoned to the enemy. Such was the &s;trength and perfection of the&s;e buildings.</P>
<P>The fourth year of Agricola's goverment, and the la&s;t of the reign of Titus, was pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ecur|ing from inva&s;ions the mo&s;t &s;outhern parts of Scot|land, or what we may call the mo&s;t northern parts of England.</P>
<P>The fifth &s;ummer was employed differently from any of the former. Agricola &s;et &s;ail with his army, not &s;o much with an intention of conquering new nations, as of viewing the coa&s;ts and ports of Scot|land, and of vi&s;iting the &s;everal little i&s;lands that lie di&s;per&s;ed in the Atlantic and Caledonian &s;eas. In this expedition he had a view of Ireland; an i&s;land, &s;ays Tacitus, which in the &s;oil and tempera|ture of the air, and in the di&s;po&s;itions and fa&s;hions of the people, bears a near re&s;emblance to Britain.</P>
<P>Agricola looked upon the conque&s;t of Ireland as a &s;tep of importance to the Roman Empire. He repre&s;ented it as &s;uch in his letters to Rome: and he po&s;itively intended a future de&s;cent upon that kingdom; but all his great de&s;igns were fru&s;|trated: Domitian reigned.</P>
<P>The remaining years of Agricola's government were pa&s;&s;ed very much in the &s;ame manner with the former. Skirmi&s;hes by land, and expeditions by &s;ea, in &s;ummer; buildings and admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice during the other &s;ea&s;ons. In mo&s;t places, as &s;oon as Agricola appeared he conquered. His reputation, and his high name, &s;eem to have been as effectual as his arms; and indeed the records of hi&s;tory have &s;carce produced a greater man.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="304">Domitian was of a mo&s;t envious &s;u&s;picious tem|per. He grew jealous of his propraetor's charac|ter: but the timidity and hypocri&s;y of his nature hindered him from an open, or an immediate de|claration of his &s;pleen. He &s;uffered Agricola to hold the government till the year of Rome 837, and then he appointed Salu&s;tius Lucullus governor in his &s;tead.</P>
<P>In this place our hi&s;tory becomes very ob&s;cure. The anecdotes of the &s;tate are almo&s;t as fabulous as the anecdotes of the church: but as we may be tolerably certain of the exact bounds of the Ro|man conque&s;ts in England and Scotland, they are a point worthy of remembrance.</P>
<P>A line or wall of fortifications was con&s;tructed by Agricola from the mouth of the river Forth to the mouth of the river Clyde. The &s;everal colo|nies on the &s;outh of that line had been entirely &s;ub|dued, and were within the Roman pale: all the land beyond that line remained in a &s;tate of free|dom, and was called Caledonia.</P>
<P>Domitian died in the year of Rome, 848. He was the la&s;t of the family of Ve&s;pa&s;ian, and of that &s;et of emperors who were looked upon as mo&s;t nearly allied in affinity to Julius Cae&s;ar. It is &s;carce worth while to take a retro&s;pect of our ance&s;tors at this particular period. The &s;pace of time indeed &s;ince the fir&s;t inva&s;ion by the Romans amounts to near a century and a half; but the improvements of the Britons in literature are, by no means, equal to that interval. Their chief, and perhaps their only characteri&s;tic, was courage. Tacitus indeed lets drop one &s;entence that &s;eems to reflect &s;ome
<PB N="286" REF="305">
little degree of honour upon the genius of the na|tives: he &s;ays,
<Q>Agricola took care, that the young Briti&s;h princes &s;hould be in&s;tructed in the liberal &s;ciences; and in his own opinion, he pre|ferred the natural faculties of the Britons to the acquired &s;tudies of the Gauls, as the former were now earne&s;tly de&s;irous to learn the art of eloquence, although they had lately &s;hewn a di&s;like to the Roman language.</Q>
Or in other words,
<Q>The Britons had long &s;ince wi&s;hed to be taught, but till now they had dete&s;ted their teachers.</Q></P>
<P>A thir&s;t of knowledge is always reputed com|mendable; at lea&s;t we are &s;ure it is natural: but if we reject prejudice and &s;peak truth, mu&s;t not we own, that the arts and &s;ciences are &s;o many lead|ing avenues to luxury? They in&s;truct and they de|light, but they &s;often and they enervate. They cannot conquer the cau&s;es of vice: they can only di&s;gui&s;e the effects. Nay, even if we &s;uppo&s;e, that they triumph over &s;ome pa&s;&s;ions; are they not apt to rai&s;e others of a wor&s;e tendency? Enquire into the original inhabitants of any nation; the in|habitants will be con&s;tantly and truly repre&s;ented as courageous and indefatigable, becau&s;e they were bred in woods, and accu&s;tomed to hard|&s;hips. As &s;oon as they were brought into cities; as &s;oon as they had ta&s;ted plea&s;ures, their alertne&s;s langui&s;hed, and their courage melted away. This was the fate of the antient Britons. Agricola had &s;agaciou&s;ly ob&s;erved the errors of his predece&s;&s;ors, and he was determined to win his enemies by me|thods which no other governor had pur&s;ued. He
<PB N="287" REF="306">
recollected the fable of the traveller, who, while the wind blu&s;tered, and blew violently, kept on his cloak in defiance of Boreas, but when the &s;un ap|peared, when he felt the rays of Phoebus, he not only threw a&s;ide his cloak, but as the heat encrea&s;ed, dive&s;ted him&s;elf of every other garment. The &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors of Agricola acted the part of Boreas. They were &s;tormy and boi&s;terous, but not &s;ucce&s;sful. They afforded no &s;un&s;hine.</P>
<P>The Caledonians, a brave and an unconquered people, lo&s;t no opportunities of driving back the Romans into the more &s;outhern parts of Britain. They were led on by Galgacus, who was a north Britain of great valour, and of high birth: he had made a con&s;iderable re&s;i&s;tance, even again&s;t Agri|cola. It is a record for ever to the honour of the Caledonians, that they were not in the lea&s;t infected by the contagious habits which had been intro|duced into South Britain. Their bravery was un|daunted, and their manners were uncorrupted. The force of numbers had lately compelled them to take refuge amid&s;t the Grampian mountains <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mountains, which run from ea&s;t to we&s;t, from near Aberdeen to Cowal in Argyle&s;hire.</NOTE>; but as &s;oon as Agricola was departed, they came forward in all their native valour; and, by their example and encouragement, animated the Britons to re&s;ume the &s;pirit of their ance&s;tors, and to join in the common cau&s;e of extirpating the Romans out of the kingdom. To execute &s;o great a work could only be the effect of time. Roman colonies had been planted; intermarriages had been made;
<PB N="288" REF="307">
fortre&s;&s;es had been built; and what was the great|e&s;t impediment, luxury had been e&s;tabli&s;hed, as &s;o many preventive bulwarks again&s;t all e&s;&s;ays of liberty and national prerogative: yet if we can gather any degree of truth from the &s;light and incongruous accounts of the&s;e times, the Britons and the Cale|donians, during the reigns of Nerva and Trajan, had made &s;ome important efforts towards the principal de&s;ign for which they had a&s;&s;ociated. Their progre&s;s, if we may believe the Scotch hi&s;|torians, was con&s;iderable; and they mu&s;t &s;oon have freed them&s;elves from the Roman yoke, if the Emperor Adrian <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The adopted &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;ior of Trajan. He was by birth a Spaniard, and began his reign in the 118th year of the chri&s;tian Aera.</NOTE> had not come over in per&s;on.</P>
<P>The Roman general, Lucius Antonius, had been dangerou&s;ly wounded, and his troops had been re|pul&s;ed in a battle again&s;t the Caledonians. This was a circum&s;tance of &s;ufficient con&s;equence to ha&s;ten Adrian to England: but neither the exact time of his arrival, nor his military actions in the i&s;land, can by any means be a&s;certained.</P>

<P><PB N="290" REF="309">The letter in the month of May &s;igned W. M. after affirming that all women, and (for ought he knows all men) think grandeur and happine&s;s &s;yno|nomous terms, remarks with more ju&s;tice, that the polite accompli&s;hments are too promi&s;cuou&s;ly aimed at by all degrees of people for their daugh|ters; but does not a&s;&s;ign (in my humble opinion) the real, and more material rea&s;ons again&s;t it, but turns back to his fir&s;t propo&s;ition, and di&s;plays the wide difference there is between riches, power, and titles, and heart-felt &s;atisfaction: where I &s;hall leave him at free liberty, to gather as many flowers as he plea&s;es, out of &s;o well &s;tocked a garden as he has cho&s;en to walk in; and only make &s;ome additional ob&s;ervations on the education of young ladies.</P>
<P>It has been my misfortune to &s;ee quite the re|ver&s;e of what that gentleman complains of; not in|&s;ignificant girls taught too much, but great ladies taught too little.</P>
<P>When I was about five and thirty, my cou&s;in german, the counte&s;s of &mdash;, de&s;ired me to come and pa&s;s a year with her, in which &s;he pro|po&s;ed going to Spa; and as her daughters were too young, &s;he &s;aid, to be any amu&s;ement to her, &s;he would leave them behind her. My &s;ituation in life, and inclinations for travelling, made me very readily accept her offer: and I took leave of my good aunt, Mrs. A&s;hgrove, who was almo&s;t as much delighted as my&s;elf with what &s;he &s;aw plea&s;|ed, and hoped might be of &s;ervice to me.</P>
<P>When I came to town, I was very much &s;ur|pri&s;ed to &s;ee two fine girls, the one about twelve, and the other ten, that did not open their mouths

before their mother, and as I &s;oon found very &s;eldom &s;aw her. My cou&s;in was a very fine lady, dre&s;&s;ed perfectly well, and gave the mo&s;t elegant entertainments; &s;he frequented the drawing-room every court-day, and generally preceded two a&s;|&s;emblies, by a play, or opera, in the evening. My day was far advanced before hers began, who gave me an opportunity to &s;ee more of my young rela|tions than &s;he did. I ob&s;erved they had about them a very ordinary Swi&s;s woman, who was called their French governe&s;s: &s;he treated them with in&s;olence, and taught them a jargon no body el&s;e could under&s;tand. Their only reading was the news-papers, when the upper &s;ervants had done with them; as for writing or dancing, it was thought they were too young, and that their acquain|tance with any of their own rank would only make them impatient, and wi&s;h for more liberty than their mother cared to give them. On talking to them, I found they did not want under&s;tand|ing; but was &s;o perverted with the knowledge of their birth, and feeling of their &s;lavery, that they were continually in&s;ulting, or in&s;ulted by the do|me&s;tics they were obliged to conver&s;e with. The elde&s;t had a great &s;pirit, and was always &s;aying, that when &s;he married &s;he would keep her &s;ervants in &s;ubjection, and no per&s;on &s;hould dare, tho' ever &s;o great, to be impertinent to her. She al|ways li&s;tened with great reli&s;h to any reflections made on her mother's conduct, in regard to the neglect of her children; which, to flatter the young ladies, the lower people would &s;ometimes throw out, and trea&s;ured up a &s;ufficient quantity of di&s;o|bedience
<PB N="292" REF="311">
and contempt for her parents, whenever &s;he &s;hould have an opportunity of &s;hewing it. The younge&s;t was of a gentler nature: &s;he &s;ubmitted to her fate, and made court to her mother's woman, whenever &s;he wanted, or wi&s;hed for a new cap, or a new coat, and to the groom of the chambers for lemonade and cakes, on tho&s;e a&s;&s;embly nights which &s;he &s;pent above &s;tairs.</P>
<P>I could not but grieve to &s;ee two creatures, that might have been the ble&s;&s;ing of the counte&s;s's declining years, merely by her own fault, give &s;uch dreadful indications of proving the contrary. I en|deavoured all I could to per&s;uade her to carry them with us to Spa, which I knew would break thro' their pre&s;ent cour&s;e of life, and force her to grow a little more acquainted with them, and they to be more informed what behaviour &s;uited them: but it was all in vain. They were aukward hoydening things, &s;he &s;aid, and &s;o young, there was no mak|ing any thing of them.</P>
<P>Some years after, I heard that the elde&s;t, being left at her father's country-&s;eat, while he and her mother made a vi&s;it into a di&s;tant country, had run away with, and married an officer that came to rai&s;e recruits in the neighbourhood; and the younger had the next year a child by the butler.</P>
<P>Now, madam, is it not obvious to you, I am &s;ure it was to me, that had both been better taught, better they would have acted? I mu&s;t add, this gay, this accompli&s;hed woman, had both a &s;en&s;e of honour and cha&s;tity; and in a few weeks after the la&s;t misfortune I mentioned hap|pened in the family, died of a broken heart.

had &s;he had religion enough to have taught it to her daughters! both by example and precept, might they not have repaid her ten fold, in grati|tude and filial love?

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of the Importance of the Education of Daughters.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING is more neglected than the education of daughters; cu&s;tom, and the caprice of mothers, are for the mo&s;t part ab&s;olutely deci&s;ive on that point. It is taken for granted, that a very little in&s;truction is &s;ufficient for the &s;ex; where|as, the education of &s;ons is looked upon as of prin|cipal concern to the public; and although there is &s;carce le&s;s mi&s;management in this than in the bringing up of daughters, neverthele&s;s people are fully per|&s;uaded that no &s;mall degree of di&s;cernment is re|qui&s;ite to in&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s. How many ma&s;ters do we &s;ee? how many colleges? what expence for im|pre&s;&s;ions of books, for re&s;earches into the &s;ciences, methods of learning languages, and choice of pro|fe&s;&s;ors?</P>
<P>All the&s;e grand preparations have frequently more &s;hew than &s;olidity; however, they indicate the high notion people have of the education of boys. As for girls, &s;ay they, what nece&s;&s;ity is their for them to be &s;cholars; curio&s;ity makes them vain and conceited; it is &s;ufficient they learn in time how to govern their families, and to &s;ubmit to their
<PB N="295" REF="314">
hu&s;bands without debate: and here they are ready to produce a number of known in&s;tances of women grown ridiculous by pretence to &s;cholar&s;hip; after this they think them&s;elves ju&s;tified in blindly aban|doning girls to the management of ignorant and indi&s;creet mothers: it is true we ought to be very cautious of making pedantick ladies. Women, for the mo&s;t part, have le&s;s &s;trength of under|&s;tanding than men, but more curio&s;ity; wherefore it is not proper to engage them in &s;tudies likely to di&s;turb their heads. It is not for them to govern the &s;tate, direct the operations of war, or to interfere in the admini&s;tration of religious affairs. Thus they may &s;tand excu&s;ed from tho&s;e exten&s;ive articles of knowledge relative to politics, the art military, juri&s;prudence, theology: even the far greater part of the mechanic arts are not &s;uitable to them. They are formed for gentler occupations: their bodies, as their under&s;tanding, are le&s;s vigorous, le&s;s robu&s;t than tho&s;e of men; but nature, in compen&s;ation, has appropriated to them indu&s;try, neatne&s;s, and economy, and hence ari&s;es their ta&s;te for the calm du|ties of dome&s;tic life&mdash;But what are we to conclude from the natural weakne&s;s of women? the weaker they are, of the greater moment it is to give them &s;trength. Have they not duties to fulfil, nay, du|ties on which the life of &s;ociety depends? Is it not by them that families are ruined or upheld? they, who have the regulation of the whole train of do|me&s;tic affairs, who have a general influence upon manners, and by con&s;equence the &s;way in what mo&s;t nearly affects all mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="315">A woman of judgment, application, and real piety, is the &s;oul of a whole great family: &s;he in|&s;pires that order, that prudence, and purity of man|ners which &s;ecure happine&s;s here and hereafter. It is not in the power of men, tho' ve&s;ted with all public authority, by their deliberations, to make any e&s;tabli&s;hments effectually good, unle&s;s women are aiding in the execution.</P>
<P>The world is not a phantome: it is an a&s;&s;emblage of families; and who can adju&s;t the government of them with more exactne&s;s than the women? They, be&s;ides their natural authority, and a&s;&s;iduity in their hou&s;es, have the further advantage of being born careful, minutely attentive, indu&s;trious, in|&s;inuating, and per&s;ua&s;ive.</P>
<P>As for mankind, where el&s;e mu&s;t they look for the comforts of life, if marriage, that clo&s;e&s;t of all alliances, &s;hall be converted into bitterne&s;s? and children, who in their turn will be called man|kind, what will become of them, if &s;poiled by their mothers from their infancy.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve the parts women have to act, they are not of le&s;s moment than tho&s;e of the men; in|a&s;much as they have a hou&s;e to regulate, a hu&s;|band to make happy, children to bring up well; add that public virtue is no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary for the women than for the men. Without in&s;i&s;t|ing on the good or evil import they may be of to the world, they are half of the human &s;pecies redeemed by the blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and de&s;tined to life eternal. Finally, to omit the good influence of women well brought up, let us con&s;ider the evils they are productive of, in defect of an education
<PB N="297" REF="316">
in&s;piring them with virtue. It is certain this de|fect in them is more mi&s;chievous than in men, be|cau&s;e the irregularities of men frequently proceed from the bad education they have imbibed from their mothers, and from tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions other wo|men have in&s;pired them with in their riper years. What intrigues does hi&s;tory pre&s;ent to our view? What &s;ubver&s;ion of laws and morals? What bloo|dy wars, innovations of religion, revolutions of &s;tate? all cau&s;ed by the vices of women. The&s;e are proofs of the importance of a good education for girls. Let us next con&s;ider the means.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE COUNT DE COMMINGE CONTINUED.</HEAD>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed the night in the utmo&s;t agitation, and af|ter having formed a thou&s;and different pro|jects, all equally fruitle&s;s and impracticable, it came &s;uddenly into my mind to burn the writings which were &s;till in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, tho&s;e now hated writings that proved our claim to the e&s;tates of the family of Lu&s;&s;an. I was a&s;toni&s;hed that I had not hit upon this expedient &s;ooner, &s;ince it was the mo&s;t effectual method I could take to put an end to a &s;uit, the con&s;equence of which I had &s;o much dreaded.</P>
<P>It was not impo&s;&s;ible but my father who had proceeded very far might be induced to terminate the affair amicably by my marriage with Adelaida; but although there &s;hould be no foundation for &s;o plea&s;ing a hope, yet I could not con&s;ent to furni&s;h arms again&s;t what I loved. I reproached my&s;elf for having &s;o long kept papers in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion which ought to have been &s;ooner &s;acrificed to my tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="318">The reflection of the injury I did my father could not &s;top me a moment from the execution of this de&s;ign. This e&s;tate was entailed upon me, and I inherited one left me by my mother's brother, which I could re&s;ign to him to procure his pardon, and which was much more con&s;iderable than that I was the cau&s;e of his lo&s;ing.</P>
<P>There needed no more arguments to convince a man in love, and already determined. I went in|&s;tantly to my clo&s;et for the little box which con|tained the&s;e papers. Never had I in my whole life experienced &s;o happy a moment, as that in which I committed them to the flames. I was tran&s;port|ed into rapture at the thoughts of &s;o effectually &s;er|ving the object of my pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>If &s;he loves me, &s;aid I, &s;he &s;hall one day know the &s;acrifice I have made for her; but if I am not &s;o happy as to touch her heart, &s;he &s;hall always remain in ignorance of it. Why &s;hould I make her &s;en&s;ible of an obligation &s;he would be &s;orry to owe to me? I would have Adelaida love me, but I would not have her think her&s;elf indebted to me. I confe&s;s, however, that after this action, I found my&s;elf imboldened to declare my &s;entiments to her, and the freedom with which I vi&s;ited at her mo|ther's, gave me an opportunity that very day.</P>
<P><Q>I am going to leave you, charming Adelaida, &s;aid I, will you have the goodne&s;s to think &s;ometimes of a man who&s;e happine&s;s, or who&s;e mi&s;ery you only can make?</Q>

<P><Q>What would you have me &s;ay to you? replied &s;he, with vi&s;ible emotion; I ought not to have heard you, and &s;till le&s;s ought I to an&s;wer you.</Q></P>
<P>Scarce did &s;he give her&s;elf time to pronounce the&s;e words, &s;he left me &s;o &s;uddenly. I &s;tayed the re&s;t of the day there, but I found it impo&s;&s;ible again to &s;peak to her alone. She avoided me care|fully; &s;he had an air of perplexity and confu&s;ion; how lovely did &s;he appear to me with that perplex|ed air, and that &s;weet innocent confu&s;ion. My re&s;pect for her was equal to my love; I could not look on her without trembling, I dreaded le&s;t my pre&s;ump|tion had made her repent of her goodne&s;s towards me.</P>
<P>I &s;hould longer have ob&s;erved a conduct &s;o con|formable to my re&s;pect for her, and to the delicacy of my own &s;entiments, if the nece&s;&s;ity I was under of leaving her had not forced me to &s;peak. I was willing to tell Adelaida my true name before I went away; but I dreaded this declaration even more than my former.</P>
<P><Q>I perceive you avoid me, madam, &s;aid I to her. Alas! what will you do when you know all my crimes, or rather my misfortunes? I have impo&s;ed upon you by a fal&s;e name, I am not the per&s;on you think me; I am, pur&s;ued I, trembling, with the violence of my apprehen&s;ions, the &s;on of the count de Comminge.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The &s;on of the count de Comminge! cried Adelaida, with a&s;toni&s;hment and grief in her face,
<PB N="301" REF="320">
our enemy, our per&s;ecutor! do not you and your father urge the ruin of mine?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Oh do not wound me with &s;o cruel a thought! interrupted I, tears in &s;pite of my&s;elf, &s;treaming from my eyes; in me, charming Adelaida, you behold a lover ready to &s;acrifice all for you; my father will never injure yours; my love &s;e|cures him in your intere&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But why, replied Adelaida, recovering from her &s;urprize, why have you deceived me? why did you conceal your true name? Had I known it, pur&s;ued &s;he, &s;oftly &s;ighing, it would have warned me to fly from you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Oh, do not, madam, &s;aid I, taking her hand which I forcibly ki&s;&s;ed, do not repent of your goodne&s;s towards me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Leave me, &s;aid &s;he withdrawing her hand, the more I &s;ee you the more inevitable I render tho&s;e misfortunes I too ju&s;tly apprehend.</Q></P>
<P>The latent meaning of the&s;e words filled me with a tran&s;port that &s;uffered nothing but hope to appear. I flattered my&s;elf that I &s;hould be able to render my father favourable to my pa&s;&s;ion. This belief &s;o wholly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me, that I thought every one &s;hould think as I did. I &s;poke to Adelaida of my projects like one who is &s;ecure of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><Q>I know not, &s;aid &s;he with a melancholy air, why my heart refu&s;es to yield to the hopes you endeavour to in&s;pire. I fore&s;ee nothing but mi&s;ery in the cour&s;e of this affair; yet I find a plea&s;ure in feeling what I do for you: I have not hid my &s;entiments from you; I am willing
<PB N="302" REF="321">
you &s;hould know them, but remember that if there is a nece&s;&s;ity for it, I am capable of &s;acri|ficing them to my duty.</Q></P>
<P>I had &s;everal conver&s;ations with Adelaida be|fore my departure, and always found new cau&s;e to congratulate my&s;elf on my good fortune; the plea|&s;ure of loving and knowing that I was beloved, fill|ed my whole heart; no &s;u&s;picion, no fear for the future could di&s;turb the tender &s;oftne&s;s of our in|terviews. We were &s;ecure of each other's affection, becau&s;e e&s;teem was the ba&s;is of it; and this cer|tainty far from dimini&s;hing the ardour of our pa&s;&s;ion, added to it all the &s;weets of hope, and all the charms of confidence.</P>
<P><Q>I &s;hould die with grief, &s;aid &s;he to me, if I bring upon you the di&s;plea&s;ure of your father; I would have you love me, but oh, I would rather have you happy!</Q></P>
<P>I parted from her at length, full of the mo&s;t tender and mo&s;t ardent pa&s;&s;ion that ever man felt, and my whole &s;oul intent upon the de&s;ign of ren|dering my father favourable to it.</P>
<P>In the mean time he was informed of every thing that had pa&s;&s;ed at the baths. The &s;ervant whom he had put about me had &s;ecret orders to ob&s;erve my conduct; this man had left him ignorant of nothing, neither of my love, nor my quarrel with the chevalier de Saint Oden. Unfortunately the chevalier was the only &s;on of one of my father's mo&s;t intimate friends; this circum&s;tance, and the danger to which he was reduced by his wound, turned every thing again&s;t me. The &s;ervant who
<PB N="303" REF="322">
had given him &s;uch exact informations, repre&s;ented me to be much happier than I was. He de&s;cribed madam and mademoi&s;elle de Lu&s;&s;an as full of artifice and de&s;ign, as having always known me for the count de Comminge, and had &s;pared no pains to &s;educe me.</P>
<P>Thus prejudiced, my father, naturally &s;evere and pa&s;&s;ionate, treated me at my return with great har&s;hne&s;s: he reproached me with my pa&s;&s;ion as with a crime of the blacke&s;t dye.</P>
<P><Q>You have been ba&s;e enough, &s;aid he to me, to love my enemies, and without reflecting what you owed either to me or to your&s;elf, you have entered into engagements with tho&s;e I hate, and I know not, added he, whether you have not done &s;omething &s;till more worthy of my re&s;ent|ment!</Q></P>
<P><Q>Yes, Sir, an&s;wered I, throwing my&s;elf at his feet, I am guilty, I confe&s;s, but I am &s;o in &s;pite of my&s;elf. At this very moment when I implore your pardon, I feel that no power on earth can tear from my heart that pa&s;&s;ion which offends you. Have pity on me, and oh! &s;uffer me to &s;ay it, have pity on your&s;elf, put an end to that hatred which di&s;turbs the tranquillity of your life. The tenderne&s;s which the daughter of mon&s;ieur de Lu&s;&s;an and I felt for each other at fir&s;t &s;ight, &s;eems a warning from heaven to you. Alas! my dear father, you have no other child but me! would you make me mi&s;erable and load me with misfortunes &s;o much the more un&s;up|portable as they will come from a hand I mu&s;t
<PB N="304" REF="323">
ever love and revere? Suffer your&s;elf, my dear father to be &s;oftened into forgivene&s;s of a &s;on, who has offended you only by a fatality for which he could not be an&s;werable.</Q></P>
<P>My father, who had &s;uffered me to continue kneeling during the whole time I was &s;peaking to him, looked on me for a moment with mingled &s;corn and indignation.</P>
<P><Q>I have, &s;aid he, heard you with a patience I am my&s;elf a&s;toni&s;hed at: I will &s;till pre|&s;erve compo&s;ure enough to tell you what is the only favour you are to expect from me; you mu&s;t renounce your ill-placed pa&s;&s;ion, or the quality of my &s;on. Take your choice, and this in&s;tant deliver me the writings you have in your cu&s;tody; you are no longer worthy of my confidence.</Q></P>
<P>If my father had &s;uffered him&s;elf to be moved by my &s;upplications, the demand he made of the papers would have greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed me: but his har&s;hne&s;s gave me courage.</P>
<P><Q>Tho&s;e writings, &s;aid I, ri&s;ing, are no longer in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, I have burned them: but the e&s;tate I inherit of my uncle's &s;hall be yours, in|&s;tead of tho&s;e they would have given you.</Q></P>
<P>I had &s;carce time to pronounce the&s;e few words. My father, mad with rage, drew his &s;word, and would doubtle&s;s have run me through, for I made not the lea&s;t effort to avoid him, if my mother had not entered the room that in&s;tant, and threw her|&s;elf, half dead with terror, between us.</P>
<P><Q>Ah! what would you do, &s;aid &s;he, ga&s;ping with the violence of her fears, is he not your &s;on?
<PB N="305" REF="324">
Then forcing me out of the room, &s;he ordered me to expect her in her own apartment.</Q></P>
<P>I waited there a long time before &s;he appeared: &s;he came at length. I had no longer rage, excla|mation, and menaces to combat; but a tender mo|ther, who entered into all my griefs, and intreated me with tears, to have companion on the condition to which I had reduced her.</P>
<P><Q>What, my &s;on, &s;aid &s;he to me, &s;hall a mi&s;tre&s;s, and a mi&s;tre&s;s whom you have known &s;o &s;hort a time, be preferred to your mother? Alas! if your happine&s;s depended upon me, I would &s;acrifice every thing to &s;ecure it; but you have a father who will be obeyed. He is upon the point of taking the mo&s;t violent re&s;olutions again&s;t you. Oh, my &s;on! if you would not make me mi&s;e|rable, &s;uppre&s;s a pa&s;&s;ion that will render us all unhappy.</Q></P>
<P>I remained &s;ome moments &s;ilent: how difficult was it to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch a plea, &s;o tenderly urged by a mother for whom I had the highe&s;t filial affection? but love was &s;till more powerful.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Metamorpho&s;es of ANIMALS, and the &s;everal Changes ob&s;ervable in ANIMAL LIFE.</HEAD>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t complete, and at the &s;ame time the mo&s;t univer&s;al of all the&s;e metamorpho&s;es is that wherein the animal appears in four &s;everal &s;hapes: which is the ca&s;e with much the greate&s;t part of the winged inhabitants of the air of the infect tribe; &s;ome of which in their different &s;tates have been by turns tenants of earth, air, and water. End|le&s;s would it be to enumerate all the various genera of infects who undergo the&s;e changes. We &s;hall therefore content our&s;elves, as in the la&s;t ca&s;e, with only mentioning one of each &s;ort, viz. Of tho&s;e who&s;e origin is water, and of tho&s;e who&s;e ri&s;e is from the earth.</P>
<P>Of the fir&s;t, let the common gnat be taken for our example. This little delicate tender in&s;ect, which the gentle&s;t touch will de&s;troy, the lea&s;t breath of
<PB N="307" REF="326">
wind waft upon its bo&s;om, and the lea&s;t drop of rain buries in its waves, yet fir&s;t &s;ees exi&s;tence in that rough and turbulent element the water. There it is the parent lays her egg, which is hatched by &s;ome means we can little comprehend, (for heat can have no influence at the bottom of the water) comes out a little groveling worm, minute and unob&s;ervable; changing from this, however, it &s;oon ari&s;es towards the &s;urface of the water, where, hanging &s;u&s;pended on an air-bubble, no bad emblem of the general dependence of human affairs, it pa&s;&s;es thro' a thou&s;and fluctuations; now hurried onwards by the rapid power of tides, or the uncertain gu&s;t of winds varying at every moment, and now gliding &s;moothly on the calm even &s;ur|face of a gla&s;&s;y dream, till at length &s;eizing on the happy moment for deliverance from this &s;u&s;|pence, it drops the &s;lough which now envelops it, and mounting into air, quits and di&s;dains alike its helple&s;s &s;tate of infancy, and its precarious anxious &s;ituation when brought to &s;omewhat more appa|rent ripene&s;s. Reflect on this, oh man, and think what art thou but a poor in&s;ect, cru&s;hed before the moth!</P>
<P>As to the land metamorpho&s;is of this com|pleate&s;t kind, we need go no further to illu&s;trate it, than to that u&s;eful animal the &s;ilk-worm, as he is perhaps the mo&s;t perfect of this cla&s;s of in&s;ects. His fir&s;t &s;tate is, as that of all others of his kind, the egg. From this he i&s;&s;ues a &s;mall black maggot, which, after having &s;hifted many various coats, and increa&s;ed his bulk to upwards of a thou&s;and times its original &s;ize, weaves out of his own bowels a

&s;ilken monument in which he lies interred for a &s;hort &s;pace, and then &s;allies forth an elegant fly, compleat in every part, and as different from the worm it &s;prung from as fire from earth, or any the mo&s;t pure can be from the gro&s;&s;e&s;t being. In this mo&s;t perfect &s;tate, he ranges through creation, &s;eems to be diverted even of the nece&s;&s;ities of nature (for in the fly-&s;tate none of tho&s;e creatures take any food) and in &s;hort appears to be transformed into a perfect &s;ylph, de&s;tined to nothing but the perpe|tuating of its &s;pecies, which being once in&s;ured, it re&s;igns its life as no longer worth the pre&s;erva|tion.</P>
<P>To the fir&s;t cla&s;s of the&s;e changes may be re|ferred every one of the gnat, midge, dragon-fly, and ichneumon cla&s;s; and to the latter all the fly, moth, and butterfly &s;pecies. Were we to enter into particulars, the detail would be endle&s;s. This sketch, however, may &s;uffice to turn the &s;oul of man to a reflection on the vici&s;&s;itude and fluctua|tion of his own &s;tate, and to remind him that after the alterations he meets with in this life, which only lead him to that &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility, that even the minute&s;t in&s;ect &s;eems obliged to pa&s;s thro' ere it can reach its limited degree of perfection; there mu&s;t be &s;ome final &s;tate &s;uperior to them all, and which, with him, has the advantage denied to the&s;e &s;ymbols of his happine&s;s, that it &s;hall la&s;t to all eternity.</P>

<PB N="309" REF="329">
<HEAD>The Natural HISTORY of the FORMICA-LEO, or LION-PISMIRE.</HEAD>
<P>Nature who has with the utmo&s;t care allotted to every &s;pecies of animals its peculiar place of re&s;idence and its peculiar kind of food, has al&s;o with equal wi&s;dom furni&s;hed every individual with the means of rendering &s;uch habitation the mo&s;t commodious, and of procuring &s;uch food with the greate&s;t ea&s;e. Numberle&s;s expedients, numberle&s;s &s;tratagems has &s;he in&s;tructed even the minute&s;t in&s;ects in, for the en&s;naring and over-powering tho&s;e animals which &s;he has de&s;tined to be his prey. Of the&s;e we &s;hall in the cour&s;e of this work relate many, of which, however, there are few more curious, and at the &s;ame time more &s;imple than that of the little animal which now falls under our con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The formica-leo, or lion-pi&s;mire, is a very &s;mall in&s;ect, not much bigger than a large em|met, which, however, notwith&s;tanding its name, bears no re&s;emblance to the pi&s;mire cla&s;s, either in its figure or di&s;po&s;ition. On the contrary, as the laborious ant ranges about every where with the greate&s;t indu&s;try to find its food in the &s;ummer-time, and lay it up in &s;torehou&s;es for the winter; the animal we are &s;peaking of keeps it&s;elf ever con|fined to a &s;ingle &s;pot, waiting with a mo&s;t amazing degree of patience and per&s;everance for the &s;upply of the pre&s;ent moment, as chance &s;hall throw it in its way; nay, even when that chance has &s;o far favoured him as to bring &s;ome devoted victim to|wards his cell, he in&s;tead of advancing forwards to
<PB N="310" REF="330">
lay hold on it, con&s;tantly retires from it, as if he &s;eemed to make it a point that the de&s;truction of it &s;hould be entirely its own act, or unavoidable misfortune.</P>
<P>The form of the lion-pi&s;mire is that repre&s;ented at Fig. I. and II. in the plate annexed to this work, of which the fir&s;t repre&s;ents the back, and the other the belly, although both about four times as big as life. The body of it is of an annular texture, by which means the tail is rendered extremely pliable and apt for the u&s;e which we &s;hall hereafter de|&s;cribe. It has &s;ix legs, placed as tho&s;e of mo&s;t in|&s;ects are in the thorax. Its head is &s;mall and flat, and from the forepart of it two pretty long horns &s;hoot out, and between them a pair of &s;errated or &s;aw-like forcipes, wherewith it de&s;troys and tears to pieces tho&s;e creatures which are unfortunate enough to fall within its reach. The horns are about the &s;ixth part of an inch in length, and bend like hooks in the extremity. Towards their in&s;ertion appear two &s;mall eyes very black and lively, and which are extremely &s;erviceable to the creature, for he &s;tarts from the &s;malle&s;t objects he di&s;covers. Other animals are furni&s;hed with wings, or feet at lea&s;t, to render them expeditious in the pur&s;uit of their prey. But this creature &s;eems to make u&s;e of his legs for little more purpo&s;e than to bear him backwards from his prey, which as we have be|fore ob&s;erved mu&s;t come to him. He is, however, provided with means of cau&s;ing it to fall into the ambu&s;cade he prepares for it. This is the only re&s;ource he has for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, the only piece of skill that he is ma&s;ter of. That power, however, which has provided for every one whatever may
<PB N="311" REF="331">
be needful, has rendered this one knowledge &s;uffi|cient for all his purpo&s;es whil&s;t in his terre&s;trial &s;tate; for this creature, as we &s;hall farther relate, undergoes &s;ome of tho&s;e metamorpho&s;es which we have before given an account of. His method of obtaining food is then as follows:</P>
<P>The place which he always chu&s;es as fitte&s;t for the &s;cene of action is a bed of dry &s;and, at the foot of a wall, or under &s;ome &s;helter where no rain can come at it, either to di&s;concert his work, or prevent the effect of his operations; which could by no means an&s;wer their intended purpo&s;e, were they to be attempted either in a &s;olid &s;oil, or in a moi&s;t &s;and, neither of which would be tractable to his tools, or become &s;erviceable to the completion of his de&s;ign.</P>
<P>He begins to work then, by bending the hinder part of his body which tapers into a point, and then plunging it like a plough-&s;hare into the &s;and, which he throws up in his rear with a backward motion of his body; and thus by repeating his efforts, and taking &s;everal rounds, he at la&s;t traces out a circu|lar furrow, who&s;e diameter always equals the depth which he intends to &s;ink it. Near the edge of the fir&s;t furrow he opens a &s;econd, and then a third, and &s;o on to a great number, every one of which is &s;maller then the preceding one; &s;inking him|&s;elf from time to time deeper and deeper in the &s;and, which he throws wide with his horns, &s;till ca&s;ting it up behind him with his rail as with a &s;pade, and by the repeated &s;trokes of his head whirling it out of the circle till he has compleatly
<PB N="312" REF="332">
formed his cell, which is a cavity in the form of an inverted cone, or the in&s;ide of a funnel.</P>
<P>This cell is larger or &s;maller in proportion to the growth, and con&s;equently to the &s;ize of the ani|mal; but in a full grown one, is &s;ometimes up|wards of two inches in diameter and as much in depth.</P>
<P>When this loo&s;e and un&s;table fabrick is thus fini&s;hed, he forms his ambu&s;cade in the center of it, concealing him&s;elf in &s;uch a manner under the &s;and, that his horns form an exact circle round the central termination, or apex of the cone. In this &s;ituation he remains entirely motionle&s;s watching for his prey, which is compo&s;ed of &s;mall in&s;ects of many kinds, more e&s;pecially the female ant, who being unprovided with wings, like the genera|lity of in&s;ects, is le&s;s able to e&s;cape when once me falls into the &s;nare. Other animals, however, are far from being &s;afe from the dexterity of this skill|ful hunter. Fatal is the moment in which any one is &s;o indi&s;creet as to venture near the edge of this precipice, which de&s;cending in a &s;teep &s;lope, and that formed of a light loo&s;e &s;and, immediately gives way, and hurries it down in&s;tantly to the cen|ter. But le&s;t its own weight &s;hould not be &s;uf|ficient to prevent its recovering a fir&s;t fal&s;e &s;tep, no &s;ooner does our ambu&s;cader perceive by the fall of &s;ome few grains of &s;and that a prize is near, than by &s;hrinking back he removes the lower &s;and, and undermining the more extreme parts obliges the bank to break and roll down, bringing down with it, and at the &s;ame time overwhelming what|&s;oever happens to be near its verge.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="333">It &s;ometimes, however happens, that the in&s;ect thus entrapped being endowed with peculiar agility, or provided with wings, is able to ri&s;e above this fir&s;t envelopement. In this ca&s;e the lion-pi&s;mire defeats its efforts by whirling a large quantity of &s;and into the air by means of his tail above the height of the ri&s;ing animal. This falling again in what to &s;o tender a creature as a gnat, fly, or emmet, is equal to a dreadful &s;hower of &s;tones, the unfortunate in&s;ect beat down, overwhelmed by the tempe&s;t that pours down from every quarter, and hur|ried away by the in&s;tability of the &s;and which rolls from under his feet, falls between the &s;errated forcipes of his enemy, who plunging them into his body, drags it under the land, and there trium|phantly fea&s;ts on his thus devoted victim.</P>
<P>This great end being brought about, and our voracious animal thus &s;ated with an ample meal &s;ucked from the juices of his prey, his next care is to remove the carca&s;e, le&s;t the appearance of a dead body &s;hould alarm others, and give notice of the fatal and treacherous nature of this &s;eemingly inof|fen&s;ive cavern. He therefore extends his horns, and with a &s;udden &s;pring to&s;&s;es the light exuvium of the &s;lain to at lea&s;t half a foot beyond the borders of his trench. And in ca&s;e his habitation &s;hould in the cour&s;e of one of the&s;e exploits be any way di&s;concerted or filled up, if the aperture becomes too large for the depth, or the declivity lo&s;es its proper &s;lope, he in&s;tantly &s;ets him&s;elf to work and repairs the whole, rounding, deepening, and clear|ing the cavity with a mo&s;t amazing expertne&s;s; which done, he again conceals him&s;elf in the &s;and,
<PB N="314" REF="334">
and waits in an apparent &s;tate of inactivity for whatever &s;hall fall next into his &s;nare.</P>
<P>In the doing this his patience and per&s;everance are &s;o great, and nature has provided him with &s;uch abilities for ab&s;tinence, that he &s;ometimes pa&s;&s;es whole weeks, nay months without motion, and what is &s;till more &s;urprizing without food it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The lion-pi&s;mire, hid at the bottom of his trench, and whirling the &s;and on an ant to pre|vent its regaining the bank, is repre&s;ented at Fig. III.</P>
<P>The lion-pi&s;mire, however, as I have ob&s;erved before, does not pa&s;s his whole life under the form we have here de&s;cribed. He is to become a fly; but before he can undergo &s;o great and extraordinary a metamorpho&s;is, it is nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould pa&s;s through a period of temporary death, for which &s;tate he prepares in the following manner, building to him&s;elf a &s;ecure and convenient tomb, wherein he lies decently inurned till the appointed moment when he is to ari&s;e from his inactive &s;tate, and be|come the inhabitant of another element.</P>
<P>When the time comes for this re&s;ignation of his fir&s;t life, he troubles him&s;elf no further about the order and form of his trench, but falls to work in the &s;and, &s;triking out a great number of irregu|lar tracks in it, with an eagerne&s;s that appears as if it was de&s;igned to throw him into a &s;weat. Be this as it will, it is certain that his body becomes at this time covered over with a vi&s;cous moi&s;ture, which as he rolls him&s;elf about in the &s;and, where|in he plunges him&s;elf in every direction, fixes and
<PB N="315" REF="335">
unites all the grains he touches. With the&s;e &s;andy particles and the dried glew that con&s;olidates them, he forms a cru&s;t which encompa&s;&s;es his whole body like a little ball of five or &s;ix twelfths of an inch diameter (Vid. fig. IV.) Within this ball, how|ever, he re&s;erves to him&s;elf a &s;ufficient &s;pace to move about; and as a bare wall of &s;and would be too har&s;h and cold for him to remain happily in, he lines it throughout with a kind of &s;ilk tape&s;try of his own weaving, compo&s;ed of threads formed from his bowels, of a beautiful pearl colour, and in|finitely &s;urpa&s;&s;ing in finene&s;s that of the &s;ilk-worm. Yet whil&s;t it is thus commodiou&s;ly and elegantly furni&s;hed within-&s;ide, the exterior &s;till retains the &s;ame rugged and unde&s;irable appearance, by which it e&s;capes the notice of birds and other animals of prey, who might perhaps be tempted by a more alluring out&s;ide.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation he lives &s;ecluded from the world, for &s;ix weeks or two months, and &s;ometimes more: at the end of which period nature having performed her &s;ecret work, he dive&s;ts him&s;elf of his horns, paws, and skin, his &s;poils &s;ink to the bottom of the ball, like a &s;uit of ca&s;t-off cloathing, and his figure is then that of the nympha, repre|&s;ented greatly magnified, and in two different di|rections at Fig. V. and VI. when tearing away his tape&s;try and bur&s;ting his rocky enclo&s;ure, he comes out a perfect animal of the dragon-fly kind, fur|ni&s;hed with four large filmy wings, with which he quits the ob&s;curity of his former &s;tate; becomes dive&s;ted of his barbarity and &s;ubtile inclinations, as well as of his cumber&s;ome weight, and in &s;hort ap|pears
<PB N="316" REF="336">
entirely a new animal, as is &s;hewn in Fig. VII.</P>
<P>The animal before us, however, is not the only example of this kind of &s;ubtilty in the in&s;ect world. There has heen di&s;covered another creature, which from the re&s;emblance it has to the lion-pi&s;mire in the method of digging a trench for intrapping its prey, has been di&s;tingui&s;hed by the authors who have de&s;cribed it by the name of the vermis-leo, or lion-worm. But as what we have &s;aid of the for|mica-leo, will equally de&s;cribe the method of this creatures procuring its food, we &s;hall not trou|ble our readers with any farther detail concerning it; but content our&s;elves with only pre&s;enting them a drawing of it at Fig. VIII. in the annexed copper|plate, in which <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b</HI> repre&s;ent the worm in its fir&s;t &s;tate, <HI>c</HI> &s;hews the nympha, or &s;econd period of its life, and <HI>d</HI> the form of the fly, or la&s;t transformation.</P>

<HEAD>THE LADY's GEOGRAPHY CONTINUED.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the MANNERS and CUSTOMS of the Inhabi|tants of AMBOYNA.</HEAD>
<P>THE men and women do not go together to the&s;e fea&s;ts, as there are apartments in their hou&s;es appropriated to each &s;ex, the&s;e i&s;landers hav|ing certain laws which do not &s;uffer all the rela|tions of the hu&s;band to &s;ee his wife. The father, mother, and children of the &s;ame family, may in|deed feed together, but not the father with the daughter-in-law, or with his grand daughters when grown up: the mother with her &s;on-in-law or grand&s;ons, or the brother and &s;i&s;ter-in-law together. Nay more, they are not even permitted to &s;ee each other when eating, and if a man &s;urpri&s;es a woman in that &s;ituation, by accident, for by de&s;ign it never happens, he acquires a &s;candal which is not to be wiped away but by the means of making her &s;ome con&s;iderable pre&s;ent. The rea&s;on of this cu&s;tom with re&s;pect to relations it is not ea&s;y to gue&s;s at; but as to the &s;eparation of the &s;exes in general, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed that jealou&s;y, of which the&s;e people have a con&s;iderable &s;hare, mu&s;t be the &s;ole cau&s;e of it.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="338">One of the principal di&s;hes which the Amboy|nians make u&s;e of in their fea&s;ts, is a hog's head, with a lemon fixed between the jaws, and adorned with a number of flowers of a very beautiful red, called Bongayraya. This di&s;h is always placed be|fore tho&s;e per&s;ons who &s;tand in the highe&s;t e&s;tima|mation; the other parts of their pork is dre&s;&s;ed in many different ways, but in every one of them with exceeding high and &s;avory &s;ea&s;onings. If they have fi&s;h, the head is always pre&s;ented to the king of the fea&s;t, who is him&s;elf for that rea&s;on called Kapalakan, or Fi&s;h-Head; of which, when he has taken as much as he thinks proper, he di&s;tri|butes the remainder among tho&s;e who &s;it near him. The turtle is one of their great delicacies, which they &s;tew at a di&s;tance from the fire, without any other liquor than the juices of the animal: but they afterwards add to it a great quantity of &s;ea&s;oning. The cocoa, &s;eago, and rice al&s;o, prepared in va|rious methods, form &s;everal di&s;hes in their enter|tainments; and of the two latter their bread is compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>They have great quantities of veni&s;on and wild-fowl, of which they are very fond, as al&s;o of the bat, dre&s;&s;ed after a particular manner. There is a kind of white worm, which is found in the rotten wood of the &s;eago tree, of about the length and thickne&s;s of the fir&s;t joint of a man's thumb, which they roa&s;t on little &s;kewers, and eat very greedily; as they do al&s;o the wawos, or reddi&s;h worms we mentioned to be &s;ound on the &s;ea coa&s;t. The&s;e are to be met with in great abundance along the &s;hore, especially in &s;tony places, about the &s;ea&s;on of the April full moon.
<PB N="319" REF="339">
In the night time they give a light like the glow-worm, which &s;eems to invite people to go in &s;earch of them; which they do, every one laying in his &s;tock at once, becau&s;e they make their appearance only for about three or four days in the whole year.</P>
<P>In the&s;e fea&s;ts, the victuals are ever dre&s;&s;ed by the women, but they are always &s;erved in by men. The principal care of the ma&s;ter of the fea&s;t, is that there may be no want of victuals; every gue&s;t has one large ve&s;&s;el &s;et before him, containing &s;e|veral little di&s;hes which are filled with all kinds of food, and after he has eaten his fill of this allow|ance, the re&s;t is carried home to his hou&s;e by the &s;ervants.</P>
<P>Their chief drink is &s;pring water, or the milk of the cocoa-nut. By way of wine they make u&s;e of the towak or &s;in, which is extracted from a tree of that name, and the &s;aguweer which di&s;tils from another, and has nearly the ta&s;te of wormwood-wine. Their &s;tronger liquors are the rack and brom made from rice, and two other kinds of &s;pirit, which they get from Japan and China. They are very fond of the French and Spani&s;h wines, but do not greatly reli&s;h the German. The women keep mo&s;tly to water, although they are by no means aver&s;e to the drinking of Spani&s;h wine, were the means of procuring it more acce&s;&s;ible to them. The u&s;e of tea and coffee is not very familiar to the Amboynians; yet they &s;ometimes take the former, e&s;pecially when they are vi&s;ited by the Dutch, to who&s;e cu&s;toms, whenever they come to any of their repa&s;ts, they accommodate them&s;elves as much as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="340">Their manner of kindling fires is much readier than ours; they rub two pieces of wood again&s;t each other, the one hard, the other &s;oft and hollow, near which they hold a bit of lint, which kindles in an in&s;tant. For the making of &s;alt, they take the pieces of old worm-eaten wood which the &s;ea throws up on the &s;hore: the&s;e they dry and reduce to a&s;hes, &s;prinkling them continually with &s;ea-water, till they form a ma&s;s of &s;alt underneath them, or el&s;e boil up the &s;ame water in a pot with the a&s;hes of certain leaves for two or three days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, at the end of which they find a quantity of very good &s;alt at the bottom of the ve&s;&s;el.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE AUTHOR of the TRIFLER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Thank you for publi&s;hing the letter &s;igned Perdita: it was a prelude to my unhappy &s;tory, which I am de&s;irous the world &s;hould know; yet for the &s;ake of him, who in &s;pite of all the wrongs he has done me will be ever dear to me, I &s;hall di&s;gui&s;e the names of per&s;ons and places.</P>
<P>The facts I relate will point out the guilty only to them&s;elves; but they will di&s;play a character, which of all others is the mo&s;t dangerous to the peace of families, and to which all my misfortunes are owing.</P>
<P>At &s;ixteen I was taken from the boarding-&s;chool by my mother, to have my education fini&s;hed by a commerce with the fa&s;hionable world; but I re|ceived much le&s;s improvement from tho&s;e le&s;&s;ons of politene&s;s than from the &s;olid in&s;tructions of my father, who was a man of &s;en&s;e and learning, and who took plea&s;ure in cultivating my mind.</P>
<P>As my fortune was very con&s;iderable, I &s;oon had a &s;ufficient number of admirers; and I thought my&s;elf extremely happy in being able to touch the heart of a young gentleman, who, even before he declared his pa&s;&s;ion, had engaged my tendere&s;t affection.</P>
<P>He &s;oon obtained my con&s;ent to demand me of my parents; his birth was at lea&s;t equal to mine,
<PB N="324" REF="344">
his fortune &s;uperior, and his character unexception|able: my parents therefore thought they di&s;po&s;ed of me very happily by giving me to him.</P>
<P>A few weeks after our marriage my hu&s;band carried me to his country-&s;eat; the beauty of the place, my ta&s;te for retirement, and the tender be|haviour of the man I pa&s;&s;ionately loved, left me nothing to wi&s;h for, and I could have been content to &s;pend my whole life in this delightful abode.</P>
<P>We had lived here near a year without my hu&s;|band expre&s;&s;ing the lea&s;t inclination to return to town, when I took it into my head to &s;urpri&s;e him agreeably with the company of a young lady who had been my &s;chool-fellow, and for whom I had a very great friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>I wrote to her, and invited her to &s;pend a few months with me; the &s;pring was now far advanced, and I gave her a mo&s;t romantic de&s;cription of my charming retreat, in order to induce her to com|ply, with my reque&s;t.</P>
<P>She an&s;wered my letter with a great deal of com|mon place rallery upon the country, and my ru&s;|ticated ta&s;te, and po&s;itively refu&s;ed to come.</P>
<P>I &s;hewed her letter to Alcander, &s;o let me call my hu&s;band: he &s;miled when he read it.
<Q>This is a fine modi&s;h lady, &s;aid he, bewitched with the plea&s;ures of the town; pray in&s;i&s;t upon her coming hither, that we may make a convert of her.</Q></P>
<P>Charmed to have it in my power to oblige him, I wrote to her immediately in &s;uch pre&s;&s;ing terms to favour me with a vi&s;it, that I drew a promi&s;e
<PB N="325" REF="345">
from her to comply, and a few days afterwards her maid arrived early in the morning, and told me her lady was following in a po&s;t-chai&s;e, and had &s;ent her before to &s;pread her toilet and prepare every thing for her dre&s;&s;ing as &s;oon as &s;he arrived.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved Alcander &s;mile archly at the&s;e words, and at the &s;ight of a great number of trunks and band-boxes, which the &s;ervant had brought with her. From &s;everal things that were &s;aid by this girl, I ob&s;erved that her lady was grown extremely fanta&s;tical; and I was a little out of countenance when I reflected, that I had done no honour to my judgment, by introducing her as my friend to Alcander. Alas! madam, how little did I then imagine that this flighty creature was to rob me of my hu&s;band's affections!</P>
<P>When &s;he arrived, her appearance did not con|tradict the opinion we had formed of her; every look and motion, the &s;ound of her voice, and the turn of her expre&s;&s;ions, were calculated to &s;uit, by a pretty effronterie, the ma&s;culine graces &s;he de|rived from her hat and feather.</P>
<P>I perceived that &s;he was &s;truck with my hu&s;|band's figure, and my vanity was &s;oothed by it. Doubtle&s;s &s;he did not expect to &s;ee the fine gen|tleman and the tender hu&s;band united in the per|&s;on of my then faithful Alcander. Ah, how dearly have I &s;ince paid for the &s;hort triumph I then en|joyed!</P>
<P>I attended Belinda, &s;o let me call her, to her apartment; and here, being witne&s;s to a great deal of lively impertinence which e&s;caped her, I could not help telling her, with an ironical &s;mile,
<Q>That
<PB N="326" REF="346">
&s;he was prodigiou&s;ly improved &s;ince &s;he left the boarding-&s;chool.</Q></P>
<P>I was afraid &s;he would have been offended by the manner in which I &s;poke the&s;e words; but, to my great &s;urprize, &s;he an&s;wered, with a low cour|te&s;y and a &s;mile of &s;elf-approbation,
<Q>My dear, I am va&s;tly obliged to you.</Q>
I left her in her dre&s;&s;ing-room, to join Alcander in the garden, who diverted him&s;elf extremely with her ridiculous af|fectation.</P>
<P>We did not &s;ee her till dinner was &s;erved; and then &s;he appeared in full dre&s;s, curled, powdered, and patched, as if &s;he had been going to an a&s;&s;em|bly. The moment &s;he &s;aw Alcander her eyes fell to work, and there was nothing but ogling all dinner-time; whenever &s;he &s;poke to him, her voice was &s;oftened, and her mouth &s;crewed into a thou|&s;and different forms.</P>
<P>I might perhaps have been early alarmed at this &s;olicitude to attract the notice of my hu&s;band, had I not ob&s;erved her practice the &s;ame airs upon the fellow that waited behind her chair, who, whenever he helped her to any thing, was &s;ure to be met with a &s;parkling glance, that &s;eemed to &s;olicit his admiration al&s;o; for vanity will, as the poet &s;ays, <HI>Prey upon garbage</HI></P>
<P>I have now brought my &s;tory to that point from whence I may date all my &s;ufferings: my heart is too full at pre&s;ent to permit me to proceed; I will take another opportunity to give you the &s;equel, and am, Madam,</P>

<Q>I &s;hould be a&s;hamed, dear Mi&s;s, to own my weakne&s;s to you, if I did not know that you are too generous to think the wor&s;e of me for it: to be &s;ure I have a great value for Mr. William; but I was not &s;o fooli&s;h as to be taken with his hand&s;omene&s;s only, tho' indeed he is very hand&s;ome, and I am delighted to find that you think him &s;o; but Mr. Wil|liam, as my father can tell you, madam, is a very fine &s;cholar: he was educated in a great &s;chool at London, and there is not a young &s;quire in all this country who has half his learning, or knows how to behave him&s;elf &s;o genteely as he
<PB N="328" REF="348">
does, though his father is but a farmer: how|ever, he is rich, and he has but one child be&s;ides Mr. William, and that is a &s;ickly boy, and not likely to live; &s;o that Mr. William, it is thought, will have all.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I &s;hould imagine then, &s;aid Sophia, that this young man would not be a bad match for you?</Q></P>
<P><Q>A bad match, replied Dolly, &s;ighing: no cer|tainly; but his aunt looks higher for him: yet there was a time when &s;he was well enough plea&s;ed with his liking me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>What is his aunt, &s;aid Sophia, and how does it happen that &s;he has any authority over him?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Why you mu&s;t know, madam, an&s;wered Dolly, that his aunt is very rich; when &s;he was a young woman, a great lady took a fancy to her, and kept her as her companion a great many years, and when &s;he died, &s;he left her all her cloaths and jewels, and a prodigious deal of money: &s;he never would marry; for &s;he was cro&s;&s;ed in love, they &s;ay, in her youth, and that makes her &s;o ill natured and &s;piteful, I believe, to young people; but notwith&s;tanding that, I cannot help loving her, becau&s;e &s;he was always &s;o fond of Mr. William: &s;he is his god-mother, and when he was about ten years old &s;he &s;ent for him to London, and declared &s;he would provide for him as her own; and indeed &s;he acted like a mother towards him: &s;he put him to &s;chool, and maintained him like a gentleman; and when he grew up, &s;he would have made a gentleman of him; for &s;he had a great de&s;ire that he &s;hould be an officer.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="349">
<Q>Mr. William at that time was very fond of being an officer too; but as he was very dutiful and obedient to his father, indeed Mi&s;s Sophia he is one of the be&s;t young men in the world, he de&s;ired leave to con&s;ult him fir&s;t; &s;o about a year ago he came to vi&s;it his father, and has never been at London &s;ince; and he had not been long in the country before he changed his mind as to being an officer, and declared he would be a farmer like his father, and live a country life.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ah Dolly, &s;aid Sophia &s;miling, I &s;u&s;pect you were the cau&s;e of this change, my friend.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Why indeed, replied Dolly, he has &s;ince told me &s;o: but perhaps he flattered me when he &s;aid it; for, ah my dear Mi&s;s, I remember what you &s;aid ju&s;t now about the deceitfulne&s;s of men, and I tremble le&s;t Mr. William &s;hould be like the re&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Well, my dear, interupted Sophia, go on with your &s;tory; I am impatient to know when you &s;aw each other fir&s;t, and how your acquaintance began.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You know, madam, &s;aid Dolly, my father keeps us very retired: I had no opportunity of &s;eeing Mr. William but at church; we had heard that farmer Gibbons had a fine &s;on come from London, and the Sunday afterwards when we were at church, my &s;i&s;ter, who is a giddy wild girl, as you know, kept &s;taring about, in hopes of &s;eeing him. At la&s;t &s;he pulled me ha&s;tily, and whi&s;pered, look, look, Dolly, there is farmer Gibbons ju&s;t come in, and I am &s;ure he has got
<PB N="330" REF="350">
his London &s;on with him, &s;ee what a hand&s;ome young man he is, and how genteely he is dre&s;t!</Q></P>
<P><Q>Well, madam, I looked up, and to be &s;ure I met Mr. William's eyes full upon me; I felt my face glow like fire; for as &s;oon as I looked upon him, he made me a low bow. My &s;i&s;ter courte&s;ied; but for my part, I don't know whether I courte&s;ied or not: I was never &s;o con|fu&s;ed in my life, and during the whole time we were at church, I &s;carce ever dur&s;t rai&s;e my eyes; for I was &s;ure to find Mr. William looking into our pew.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I &s;uppo&s;e you was not di&s;plea&s;ed with him, &s;aid Sophia, for taking &s;o much notice of you?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I do not know whether I was or not, replied Dolly; but I know that I was in a &s;trange con|fu&s;ion during all church-time; yet I ob&s;erved that Mr. William did not go out when the re&s;t of the congregation did, but &s;taid behind, which made my &s;i&s;ter laugh; for he looked fooli&s;h enough &s;tanding alone. But he &s;taid to have an opportunity of making us another bow; for it is my father's cu&s;tom, as &s;oon as he has di&s;mi&s;|&s;ed the people, to come into our pew and take us home with him. I never &s;hall forget how re&s;pectfully Mr. William &s;aluted my father as he pa&s;&s;ed him. I now made amends for my for|mer neglect of him, and returned the bow he made me with a very low courte&s;y.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Fanny and I talked of him all the way home: I took delight in hearing her prai&s;e him; and al|though I was never u&s;ed to di&s;gui&s;e my thoughts before, yet I knew not how it was, but I was
<PB N="331" REF="351">
a&s;hamed to &s;peak &s;o freely of him as &s;he did, and yet I am &s;ure I thought as well of him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I dare &s;ay you did, &s;aid Sophia, &s;miling; but my dear, pur&s;ued &s;he in a graver accent, this was a very &s;udden impre&s;&s;ion. Suppo&s;e this young man who&s;e per&s;on captivated you &s;o much, had been wild and di&s;&s;olute, as many young men are; how would you have excu&s;ed your&s;elf for that early prejudice in his favour, which you took in &s;o readily at your eyes, without con&s;ulting your judgment in the lea&s;t?</Q></P>
<P>Dolly, fixing her ba&s;hful looks on the ground, re|mained &s;ilent for a moment; then &s;ighing, an|&s;wered,
<Q>I am &s;ure if I had not believed Mr. William good and virtuous, I &s;hould never have liked him, tho' he had been a hundred times hand&s;omer than he is; but it was impo&s;&s;ible to look on him and think him otherwi&s;e; and if you had ob&s;erved him well, Mi&s;s Darnley, his countenance has &s;o much &s;weetne&s;s and candor in it, as my father once &s;aid, that you could not have thought ill of him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is not always &s;afe, &s;aid Sophia, &s;ighing like|wi&s;e, to tru&s;t to appearances: men's actions as well as their looks often deceive us; and you mu&s;t allow, my dear Dolly, that there is danger in the&s;e &s;udden attachments; but when did you &s;ee this pretty youth again?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Not till the next Sunday, replied Dolly; and tho' you &s;hould chide me never &s;o much, yet I mu&s;t tell you that this &s;eemed the longe&s;t week I ever knew in my life. I did not doubt but he would be at church again, and I longed im|patiently
<PB N="332" REF="352">
for Sunday. At la&s;t Sunday came; we went with my father as u&s;ual to church, and would you believe it, Mi&s;s Darnley, tho' I wi&s;h'd &s;o much to &s;ee Mr. William, yet now I dreaded meeting him, and trembled &s;o when I came into church, that I was obliged to take hold of Fanny to keep me from falling. She &s;oon di&s;covered him, and pulled me in order to make me look up: he had placed him&s;elf in our way, &s;o that we pa&s;&s;ed clo&s;e by him. He made us a very low bow, and my mother, who had not &s;een him before, &s;miled, and looked extremely plea&s;ed with him; for to be &s;ure, Madam, &s;he could not help ad|miring him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Well, I was very unea&s;y all the time we were in church; for Fanny whi&s;pered me that my &s;weet-heart, for &s;o &s;he called Mr. William, mind|ed nothing but me. This made me blu&s;h exce&s;|&s;ively, and I was afraid my mother would take notice of his &s;taring and my confu&s;ion; &s;o that (heaven forgive me) I was glad when the &s;ermon was ended. He made us his u&s;ual compliment at our going out, but I did not look up: however, I was impatient to be alone with Fanny, that I might talk of him, and in the evening we walked towards the Park. Ju&s;t as we had placed our&s;elves under a tree, we &s;aw a fine dre&s;t gentleman, a vi&s;itor of the Squire's as we &s;uppo&s;ed, coming up to us: upon which we ro&s;e and walked home|wards; but the gentleman followed us, and coming clo&s;e to me, &s;tared impudently under my hat, and &s;wearing a great oath, &s;aid I was a pretty girl, and he would have a ki&s;s. Fanny &s;eeing him
<PB N="333" REF="353">
take me by the arm, &s;creamed aloud; but I, pre|tending not to be frightened, tho' I trembled &s;adly, civilly begg'd him to let me go. He did not regard what I &s;aid, but was extremely rude; &s;o that I now began to &s;cream as loud as Fanny, &s;truggling all the time to get from him, but in vain, and now who &s;hould come to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance but Mr. William: I &s;aw him flying acro&s;s a field, and my heart told me it was he, before he came near enough for me to know him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As &s;oon as Fanny perceived him, &s;he ran to him and beg'd him to help me; but he did not need intreaty: he flew like a bird to the place where I was, and left Fanny far behind. The rude gentleman bad him be gone, and threatened him &s;everely; for he had taken the hand I had at li|berty, which I gladly gave him, and in&s;i&s;ted upon his letting me go: and now, my dear Mi&s;s Darnley, all my fears were for him, for the gentle|man declared if he did not go about his bu&s;ine&s;s he would run him through the body, and actual|ly drew his &s;word; I thought I &s;hould have died at that terrible &s;ight; my &s;i&s;ter run towards home crying like one di&s;tracted; as for me, tho' the man had let go my hand, and I might have run away, yet I could not bear to leave Mr. Wil|liam to the mercy of that cruel wretch; and I did what at another time I &s;hould have blu&s;hed to have done. I took his hand, and pulled him with all my force away; but he, enraged at being called puppy by the gentleman, who continued &s;wearing, that he would do him a mi&s;chief, if he did not leave the place, begged me to make the
<PB N="134" REF="354">
be&s;t of my way home; and turning furiou&s;ly to him who was brandi&s;hing his &s;word about, he knocked him down with one &s;troke of a cudgel which he fortunately had in his hand, and &s;natch|ing his &s;word from him, he threw it among the bu&s;hes.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Upon my word (&s;aid Sophia) your William's character ri&s;es upon me every moment; this was a very gallant action, and I do not wonder at your liking him now.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ah, Mi&s;s (cried Dolly) if you had &s;een how he looked when he came back to me, if you had heard the tender things he &s;aid&mdash;Well, you may imagine I thanked him for the kindne&s;s he had done me, and he prote&s;ted he would with plea&s;ure lo&s;e his life for my &s;ake. I think I could have li&s;tened to him for ever; but now my father appeared in &s;ight. My &s;i&s;ter had alarmed him greatly with her account of what had happened, and he was coming ha&s;tily to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, fol|lowed by my mother and all the family. As &s;oon as we perceived them coming we mended our pace; for we had walked very &s;lowly hitherto: then it was that Mr. William, who had not &s;poke &s;o plainly before, told me how much he loved me, and begg'd I would give him leave to &s;ee me &s;ometimes. I replied, that depended upon my father, and this was prudent, was it not, my dear Mi&s;s Darnley?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Indeed it was, an&s;wered Sophia, but what &s;aid your lover?</Q></P>
<P><Q>He &s;ighed, Madam, re&s;umed Dolly, and &s;aid he was afraid my father would not think him
<PB N="335" REF="355">
worthy of me: he owned he was no otherwi&s;e worthy of me than from the great affection he bore me, and then&mdash;But here I fear you will think him too bold and perhaps blame me.</Q></P>
<P>"I hope not, &s;aid Sophia."</P>
<P><Q>Why, Madam, continued Dolly, he took my hand and ki&s;&s;ed it a thou&s;and times; and tho' I did all I could to be &s;ure to pull it away, yet he would not part with it, till my father was &s;o near that he was afraid he would ob&s;erve him; and then he let it go, and begg'd me in a whi&s;|per not to hate him. Ble&s;s me, what a &s;trange reque&s;t that was, Mi&s;s Darnely! how could I hate one to whom I had been &s;o greatly obliged! I was ready to bur&s;t into tears at the very thought, and told him I was &s;o far from hating him, that &mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q>Pray go on, my dear (&s;aid Sophia) ob&s;erving &s;he he&s;itated and was &s;ilent.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I told him, Madam, re&s;umed &s;he, that I would always regard him as long as I lived.&mdash;I did not &s;ay too much, did I?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;aid Sophia, you gave him to un|der&s;tand that it was in gratitude for the &s;ervice he had done you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>To be &s;ure, &s;aid Dolly, I put it in that light. Well I am glad you approve of my behaviour, Mi&s;s Darnley; &s;o, as I was telling you, my father came up to us, and thanked Mr. William for having re&s;cued his daughter; he then a&s;ked him what he had done with the rude fellow? Mr. William told him he had given him a lucky &s;troke with his cudgel, which had made him
<PB N="336" REF="356">
mea&s;ure his length on the ground; but, &s;aid he (and &s;ure that &s;howed exce&s;&s;ive good nature) I hope I have not hurt him much:</Q></P>
<P><Q>My father &s;aid he would go and &s;ee; and then &s;haking Mr. William kindly by the hand, he called him a brave youth, and &s;aid he hoped they &s;hould be better acquainted&mdash;Oh! how glad was I to hear him &s;ay &s;o: My mother too was va&s;tly civil to him; and as for Fanny, I thought &s;he would have hugg'd him, &s;he was &s;o plea&s;ed with him for his kindne&s;s to me. My mother in&s;i&s;ted upon his &s;taying to drink tea with us, and as &s;oon as my father came back, we all went in together.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Pray what became of the poor vanqui&s;hed knight? &s;aid Sophia, &s;miling.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Oh, I forgot to tell you, re&s;umed Dolly, that my father &s;aid he &s;aw him creeping along as if he was &s;orely brui&s;ed with his fall, &s;upporting him&s;elf with his &s;word, which it &s;eems he had found. We were all glad it was no wor&s;e, and Mr. William having accepted my mother's in|vitation, he &s;taid with us till the evening was pretty far advanced; and then my father ac|companied him part of his way home, and at parting, as he told us, de&s;ired to &s;ee him often.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He was not backward, you may be &s;ure, in complying with his reque&s;t: he came &s;o often, that my father was &s;urpri&s;ed; and be&s;ides, my &s;i&s;ter and I &s;carce ever went out to walk but we met him; &s;o that one would have imagined he lived in the fields about our hou&s;e. My mother at la&s;t &s;u&s;pected the truth, and que&s;tioned me
<PB N="337" REF="357">
about him, and I told her all that he had ever &s;aid to me; and not long afterwards he took an opportunity to open his heart to my father, and a&s;ked his permi&s;&s;ion to make his addre&s;&s;es to me. With &s;uch mode&s;ty and good &s;en&s;e he &s;poke, that my father was extremely plea&s;ed with him; but told him that he mu&s;t con&s;ult his friends, and know whether they approved of it, and then he would con&s;ider of his propo&s;al. Mr. William, as he afterwards told me, wrote to his aunt fir&s;t; for he was well a&s;&s;ured that his father would agree to any thing that &s;he thought for his ad|vantage.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He had a very favourable an&s;wer from Mrs. Gibbons, for &s;he had changed her mind al&s;o, with regard to his being an officer, as war was then talked of; and &s;he was afraid of his being &s;ent abroad. He &s;hewed me her letter, and &s;he told him in it, that &s;ince he was re&s;olved to &s;ettle in the country, &s;he approved of his marrying; and was glad he had not fixed his affections upon &s;ome home&s;pun farmer's daughter; but had cho&s;en a gentlewoman, and one who was well brought up. She added, that &s;he intended to come into the country, in a few weeks; and if &s;he found the young lady (&s;o &s;he called me) an&s;wer|ed his de&s;cription, &s;he would ha&s;ten the mar|riage, and &s;ettle us hand&s;omely.&mdash;Oh! how plea&s;ed was I with this letter, and how did it re|joice Mr. William!</Q></P>
<P><Q>I &s;hould never have done, were I to tell you all the tender things he &s;aid to me. Mr. Gib|bons,
<PB N="338" REF="358">
at his &s;on's de&s;ire, came to my father, and begged him to give his con&s;ent, which he ob|tained; for my father had well con&s;idered the af|fair before: and nothing was wanting but Mrs. Gibbons's arrival to make us all happy. Mr. Wil|liam thought every hour an age till &s;he came, and pre&s;t her continually in his letters to ha&s;ten her journey.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Alas! if he had known what was to happen, he would not have been &s;o impatient; for &s;oon after &s;he came, all our fine hopes were bla&s;ted; and I have now nothing to expect but mi&s;ery.</Q></P>
<P>Poor Dolly was &s;o oppre&s;&s;ed with grief, when &s;he came to this part of her &s;tory, that &s;he was unable to proceed, and bur&s;t into tears. The ten|der Sophia, who was greatly affected with the angui&s;h &s;he &s;aw her in, employed every &s;oothing art to comfort her. And Dolly being a little com|po&s;ed, was going to continue her &s;tory, when &s;he &s;aw her &s;i&s;ter looking about for them; Sophia and &s;he immediately ro&s;e up and joined Fanny, who rallied them both upon their fondne&s;s for lonely places; but perceiving that Dolly had been weep|ing, &s;he immediately became grave, and accommo|dated her looks and behaviour to the gentle melan|choly of her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Sophia, from the &s;tate of her own mind, was but too much di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ympathize with the love-&s;ick Dolly: the&s;e &s;oftning conver&s;ations were ill calculated to bani&s;h from her remembrance, the fir&s;t object of her innocent affections; and who, with all his faults, &s;he &s;till loved. Dolly's &s;tory
<PB N="339" REF="359">
awakened a thou&s;and tender ideas, and recalled to her memory every part of Sir Charles's conduct, which had any re&s;emblance to that of the faithful and pa&s;&s;ionate William.</P>
<P>She dwelt with tender regret upon the&s;e plea|&s;ing images, and for a while forgot how nece&s;&s;ary it was for her peace, to &s;uppre&s;s every thought of Sir Charles, that tended to le&s;&s;en her ju&s;t re&s;ent|ment again&s;t him.</P>
<P>But, good and pious as &s;he was, the pa&s;&s;ion &s;he could not wholly &s;ubdue &s;he regulated by rea&s;on and by virtue; for, as an eminent Divine &s;ays,
<Q>Although it is not in our power to make afflic|tion no affliction; yet we may take off the edge of it, by a &s;teady view of tho&s;e divine joys pre|pared for us in another &s;tate</Q></P>
<P>It was quite otherwi&s;e with Sir Charles: for the guilty, if unhappy, are doubly &s;o; becau&s;e they are deprived of tho&s;e re&s;ources of comfort, which the virtuous are &s;ure to find, in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having acted well.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, upon finding his &s;ettlement &s;ent back to him, in &s;uch a manner, as &s;hewed not only the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate re&s;olution to reject his offers, but al&s;o a &s;ettled contempt for the offerer, became a prey to the mo&s;t violent pa&s;&s;ions: rage, grief, af|fronted pride, love ill requited, and di&s;appoint|ed hope, tormented him by turns; nor was jealou&s;y without a place in his heart; the cha&s;te, the inno|cent, the re&s;erved Sophia, became &s;u&s;pected by the man, who in vain attempted to corrupt her; &s;o true it is, that libertini&s;m gives &s;uch a colour to the ac|tions
<PB N="340" REF="360">
of others, as takes away all di&s;tinction between virtue and vice.</P>
<P>Love, he argued, is either rewarded with a reci|procal affection, or with an inward and &s;ecret con|tempt; therefore he imputed Sophia's rejection of his offers, not to her di&s;approbation of the intention of them, but to want of affection for his per&s;on; and from her youth, and the tender &s;en&s;ibility of her heart, he concluded, that &s;ince he had failed in making an impre&s;&s;ion on it, it was already be|&s;towed on another; one while he re&s;olved to think no more of her, and repay her indifference and di&s;|dain, with &s;ilence and neglect; the next moment, dreading le&s;t he had lo&s;t her for ever, he regretted his having alarmed her with too early a di&s;covery of his intentions, and &s;ometimes his pa&s;&s;ion tran&s;|ported him &s;o far, as to make him think &s;eriou&s;ly of offering her his hand: then &s;tarting at his own weakne&s;s, and apprehen&s;ive of the con&s;equences, he &s;ought to arm him&s;elf again&s;t that tenderne&s;s which &s;ugge&s;ted &s;o mad a de&s;ign, by reflecting on her indifference towards him, and accounting for it in &s;uch a manner, as fixed the &s;harpe&s;t &s;tings of jealou&s;y in his mind.</P>
<P>Thus various and perplexed were his thoughts and de&s;igns; and he was incapable of re&s;olving up|on any thing, except to &s;ee her; and &s;o great was his impatience, that he would have &s;et out for Lon|don, the moment he received the fatal paper, but decency would not permit him to leave his uncle, who was in a dying condition, and wi&s;hed only to expire in his arms.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="361">The poor man, however, lingered a week longer, during which Sir Charles pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome of the mo&s;t melancholly hours he had ever known; at length, his uncle's death left him at liberty to return to London, which he did immediately, and alighted at Mrs. Darnley's hou&s;e. Upon hearing &s;he was at home, he did not &s;end in his name, but walked up &s;tairs with a beating heart; he found Mrs. Darnley, and Harriot together, but not &s;eeing the per&s;on, whom he only wi&s;hed to &s;ee, he ca&s;t a me|lancholy look round the room, and an&s;wering, in a confu&s;ed, and dejected manner, the mother's ex|ce&s;&s;ive politene&s;s, and the cold civility of the daughter, he threw him&s;elf into a chair, with a deep &s;igh, and was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>So evident a di&s;compo&s;ure plea&s;ed Mrs. Darn|ley as much as it mortified Harriot. As for Sir Charles, pride and re&s;entment hindered him at fir&s;t from enquiring for Sophia; but his anxiety and impatience to hear of her, &s;oon prevailed over all other con&s;iderations; and tho' he a&s;ked for her with an affected carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, yet his eyes, and the tone of his voice betrayed him.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley told him, that &s;he was gone into the country:
<Q>Very much again&s;t my inclination, &s;aid &s;he: but Mr. Herbert, who you know, Sir, has great power over her, more I think, than I have, would have it &s;o.</Q></P>
<P>Sir Charles turning as pale as death, replied, in great emotion,
<Q>What! gone into the country; where is &s;he gone, to whom, why did &s;he go? Again&s;t your inclination, did you &s;ay, Madam,
<PB N="342" REF="362">
what could po&s;&s;ibly induce her to this? You &s;ur|pri&s;e me exce&s;&s;ively.</Q></P>
<P>Harriot, who did not chu&s;e to be pre&s;ent at the explanation of this affair, now ro&s;e up, and went out of the room, &s;miling &s;arca&s;tically, as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed by Sir Charles, and bridling with all the triumph of con&s;cious beauty. He, who was in a bad humour, beheld her airs not only with indifference but con|tempt, which he &s;uffered to appear pretty plain in his countenance; for he thought it but ju&s;t to mor|tify her for her ill-u&s;age of her &s;i&s;ter, without con&s;idering that he him&s;elf was far more guilty, in that re&s;pect, towards the amiable Sophia, and equally de&s;erved to be hated by her.</P>
<P>When Harriot was gone, Mrs. Darnley in&s;tant|ly renewed the conver&s;ation concerning Sophia; and finding that the young baronet li&s;tened to her, with eager attention, &s;he gave him a full account of all that had happened, during his ab&s;ence: &s;he repre&s;ented Sophia, as having followed implicitly the directions of Mr. Herbert, whom &s;he called a bu&s;y, meddling, officious, old man; and as the be|haviour of her daughter, at her going away, gave &s;ufficient room to believe, that her heart &s;uffered greatly by the effort &s;he made, &s;he dwelt upon every circum&s;tance that tended to &s;hew the con|cern &s;he was under; and did not &s;cruple to exag|gerate, where &s;he thought it would be plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, tho' he inwardly rejoiced at what he heard, yet di&s;&s;embled &s;o well, that no &s;igns of it appeared in his countenance. He now &s;eemed to li&s;ten with much indifference, and coldly &s;aid, he
<PB N="343" REF="363">
was &s;orry Mi&s;s Sophia would not permit him to make her ea&s;y.</P>
<P>The tranquillity he affected alarmed Mrs. Darnley: &s;he who was ever ready to judge by ap|pearances, concluded that all was over, and that the baronet was irrecoverably lo&s;t; but had her judgment been more acute, &s;he would have per|ceived, that he was &s;till deeply intere&s;ted in every thing that related to Sophia. The que&s;tions he asked were not &s;uch as curio&s;ity &s;ugge&s;ts, but the tender anxiety of doubting love: Mrs. Darnley informed him of all he wi&s;h'd to hear; Sophia had indeed fled from him, but not without reluctance and grief: &s;he was at pre&s;ent removed from his &s;ight, but &s;he was removed to &s;ilence and &s;olitude; and &s;he carried with her a fond impre&s;&s;ion, which &s;olitude would not fail to encrea&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus &s;atisfied, he put an end to his vi&s;it, with all imaginable compo&s;ure, leaving Mrs. Darnley in doubt, whether &s;he &s;hould &s;ee him again, and more enraged than ever with Mr. Herbert, who&s;e fatal coun&s;els had overthrown all her hopes.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF BIANCA CAPELLO.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT the middle of the &s;ixteenth century, among&s;t many Florentine merchants, who re&s;ided in the celebrated city of Venice, was, a company of bankers, called the Salviati; who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s being great, they were obliged to keep many young men in their &s;ervice, for writing, ne|gotiating, and other offices. The principal of the&s;e was one Pietro Buonaventuri, a citizen of Florence, young, hand&s;ome, and genteel, whom they em|ployed as ca&s;hier.</P>
<P>Over again&s;t this bank lived a noble Venetian, the name of who&s;e family was Capello; he had among&s;t other children a daughter called Bianca, extremely beautiful, and of &s;o winning and grace|ful behaviour as enhanced the lu&s;tre of her charms. This lady, the before-mentioned Buonaventuri, became de&s;perately enamoured with; the violence of his pa&s;&s;ion, by the frequent opportunities their near neighbourhood gave them of &s;eeing each other, in time found means to di&s;cover it&s;elf to his mi&s;tre&s;s; who believing him the ma&s;ter, or at lea&s;t the part|ner of that great bank, began to regard with &s;ome attention the attractive graces of his per&s;on and manner, till this new reciprocal love augmenting
<PB N="346" REF="366">
every day, became &s;anctified at length by a private marriage, followed by many &s;ecret meetings, with the knowledge only of an old matron, governe&s;s to the lady, who had been both confidant and me|diatrix throughout the whole affair.</P>
<P>Thus for &s;ome time did the lovers continue their intercour&s;e; the bride going every night to her hu&s;band's apartment, which being on the ground floor, &s;he could ea&s;ily pa&s;s from her father's hou&s;e and return to it unob&s;erved, being but four paces di&s;tant from that of the Salviati. Her method was, when &s;he came out, to leave the dor unlocked; &s;o that returning early, &s;he was received by her governe&s;s, before the re&s;t of the family was &s;tirring; but one unlucky morning, the baker coming &s;ooner than u&s;ual, to tell the &s;ervants it was time to make the bread, and being an&s;wered, they were about it, he perceived the lock of the door was open, and thinking it was proper to fallen it, he did &s;o, be|fore he went away, as the young lady found to her great &s;urprize and grief, when having taken leave of her husband, (who accompanied her to the door of his ma&s;ter's hou&s;e) &s;he returned home; whereupon not knowing from whence this accident could happen, trembling like a leaf, and half dead with fear, &s;he went back to her lover, who endeavoured to comfort her as well as he could, and went him&s;elf into the &s;treet, ma|king &s;igns, whi&s;tling, and calling to the old con|fidant; yet all his endeavours were to no purpo&s;e, and unable to make him&s;elf heard, without a thorough di&s;covery, he came back to his wife; when now the day was &s;o far advanced, that it left no hopes of concealment for the&s;e unfortunate lovers,

who were &s;ure to die by the rage of her relations, if once their affair was known. As the la&s;t remedy they re&s;olved on flight; he taking what little mo|ney and cloaths the &s;hortne&s;s of time would permit him to get together, and &s;he having only a thin taffata robe over her &s;hift, (it being the height of &s;ummer) they ha&s;tily embarked on board a ve&s;&s;el, and in the mo&s;t &s;ecret manner that was po&s;&s;ible, pur&s;ued their journey till they arrived at Florence, where they came to the hou&s;e of Pietro's father, which &s;tood in the place of St. Mark, not far from the church of the Annunciation. The elder Buonaventuri, though a citizen, was in &s;o low a degree of fortune, that the&s;e two being added to his family, he could no otherwi&s;e maintain them, than by turning off his only &s;ervant, in who&s;e place the poor young lady was obliged to do all tho&s;e offices, that in her former &s;tate, many had been kept to do for her: and the old man being in|formed by his &s;on, that &s;he was his wife, and his own being grown in years, and very peevi&s;h, he entru&s;ted her with the management of the hou&s;e|hold likewi&s;e: all which &s;he performed for many months, with great patience and alacrity.</P>
<P>The flight of the two lovers was no &s;ooner di&s;|covered at Venice, than the father and relations of Bianca, furious with indignation, and great in power, cau&s;ed an edict to be publi&s;hed, by which, whoever &s;hould kill them in any country, was en|titled to a large &s;um of money. This cruel order coming to the ears of the fugitive pair, gave them great apprehen&s;ions; and the young lady never &s;uffered her&s;elf to be &s;een, but &s;tayed always at

home, employing her&s;elf in the affairs of her family.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t they remained in this mi&s;erable &s;ituation, it happened one day, that the grand Duke Fran|ci&s;co, &s;on of Co&s;mo the fir&s;t, was pa&s;&s;ing in his coach under the window. Bianca having a curio&s;ity to &s;ee him, lifted up the lattice, in order to have a better view; and he chancing at the &s;ame time to turn his face that way, their eyes met; which was no &s;ooner perceived by her, than &s;he immediately let down the lattice and retired; but the grand duke, un&s;atisfied with &s;o momentary a view, kept his head &s;till out of the coach, turn'd, though in vain, towards the window.</P>
<P>This ha&s;ty, and unthought of encounter, created in the mind of Franci&s;co a re&s;tle&s;s de&s;ire to know who &s;he was, and every particular concerning her; which once known, produced &s;o tender a pity in his heart, that it made him more than an equal &s;harer in all her misfortunes; and increa&s;ed &s;o much his curio&s;ity again to &s;ee her, that he either went every day to a hou&s;e of his, in that quarter of the town, called the Ca&s;ino, or to hear ma&s;s, either at the Annunciation, or St. Mark's, in hopes to procure another &s;ight of her; but all this only &s;erved to make him more eager, for a nearer and longer view; and, in order to attain his wi&s;h, he made it known to a Spani&s;h gentleman, named Mandragone, who in his infancy had been placed about him by his father, and who, ever attentive to the de&s;ires of his ma&s;ter, readily undertook the enterprize; and that it might &s;ucceed the better, engaged his wife to form an intimacy with the old woman, mother
<PB N="349" REF="369">
of Bianca's hu&s;band, in&s;tructing her in what manner &s;he &s;hould bring it about.</P>
<P>In ob&s;ervance to his orders, &s;he placed her&s;elf next to her at church, where, according to the cu&s;tom too much in u&s;e, they &s;oon began to enter into di&s;cour&s;e, in which the Spani&s;h lady having artfully brought it about, to a&s;k if her &s;on Pietro was married?</P>
<P>She an&s;wered, Yes, madam, but very unfortu|nately; and then proceeded to give her the whole hi&s;tory of what had happened in Venice. When &s;he had fini&s;hed, Signora Mandragona very com|pa&s;&s;ionately, and with great eagerne&s;s, de&s;ired &s;he would come one day to her hou&s;e, and bring her daughter-in law with her, whom, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he was extremely de&s;irous to be acquainted with; and &s;hould e&s;teem it a happine&s;s to do every thing in her power to &s;erve her.</P>
<P>To this the old woman replied, that it would be very difficult to per&s;uade her daughter, who never went abroad, to come with her; becau&s;e, added &s;he, our circum&s;tances do not permit us to buy her new cloaths; and at pre&s;ent &s;he has only tho&s;e which &s;he brought with her; &s;o that &s;he, who &s;till retains a noble &s;oul in all her poverty, will never bear to be expo&s;ed. This, replied the Spaniard, I can ea&s;ily find a remedy for: I will &s;end her a &s;uit of mine, and in tho&s;e &s;he need not fear being known.</P>
<P>I do not know, &s;ays the good old mother, whe|ther &s;he will con&s;ent without the leave of her hu&s;|band: however, I will do all I can to obey you; but I fear I &s;hall not be able to bring it about; for &s;he chu&s;es retirement, and is de&s;irous to avoid the
<PB N="350" REF="370">
&s;ight of every one; &s;o that though my &s;on has often &s;poke to her to go with me to hear ma&s;s at St. Mark's, &s;he never could be prevailed on to do it; in&s;omuch, that from the ble&s;&s;ed hour in which &s;he entered our hou&s;e, to this time, &s;he has never &s;tirred out of it.</P>
<P>Try all your power, I de&s;ire, &s;aid the Spani&s;h lady, to bring her with you; and I will &s;end my coach to fetch you both. Tell her too, that my friend&s;hip will be not di&s;agreeable to her; but, on the contrary, perhaps may do her &s;ome &s;ervice. The good old woman concluded the conver&s;ation with reiterated promi&s;es, to u&s;e her utmo&s;t endea|vours to make her daughter comply with the ob|liging reque&s;t, and &s;o they parted.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he was got home, &s;he began to di&s;|cour&s;e with her daughter-in-law, telling her exactly what had pa&s;&s;ed between the Spaniard and her&s;elf; to which &s;he added, this lady, my child, is wife to the chief favourite of the great duke; therefore her friend&s;hip is no indifferent thing: the interce&s;|&s;ion of her hu&s;band being the mo&s;t likely means to gain you the protection or &s;afe-conduct that you here &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired, and by which you may live in Florence free from the per&s;ecution of your relations, who, as you &s;ay, endeavour by all the methods they can u&s;e, to get you into their hands.</P>
<P>When the poor young creature heard her talk of the &s;afe-conduct, though &s;he had no inclination to go abroad any more to know, than to be known by others; yet, moved with the hopes of &s;ecu|rity, &s;he yielded, provided her hu&s;band gave his con&s;ent, who that very night &s;he con&s;ulted upon
<PB N="351" REF="371">
it; and he, that no le&s;s than her&s;elf &s;tood in need of protection, judging that by this lady it would be ea&s;ily obtained, (being &s;en&s;ible how great her hu&s;|band's intere&s;t was with the prince,) told her, &s;he &s;hould go; which leave having informed her mother-in-law of, &s;he immediately &s;ent word to Signora Mandragona, that when it was con|venient for her to &s;end her coach for them, they would be ready to attend her. Accordingly it &s;oon came, into which the two ladies entering, &s;hut them&s;elves up clo&s;e, and in that manner arrived at the palace of the Spani&s;h lady, where they were received with many care&s;&s;es and great joy; and being conducted into a mo&s;t magnificent and beautiful apartment, they di&s;cour&s;ed together on &s;everal &s;ub|jects; and upon that of the &s;afe-conduct, the Spa|niard did not fail to offer all the power and intere&s;t &s;he was mi&s;tre&s;s of with her hu&s;band to obtain it.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of their conver&s;ation, entered (as by chance,) the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, who, after having bowed to the ladies, &s;eemed not to know who they were; and turning to his wife, a&s;ked her? The&s;e, &s;aid me, are per&s;ons who are in want of your intere&s;t with your ma&s;ter; and then pretending to inform him, in few words, of the Venetian lady's &s;tory, which he knew better than her&s;elf, &s;he con|cluded with an earne&s;t de&s;ire, that he would inter|cede in her behalf to the grand duke, who from another room heard and &s;aw every thing that pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>All the time the Spani&s;h lady was &s;peaking to her hu&s;band, Bianca remained &s;ilent, with her eyes ca&s;t down, and full of tears, that pleaded more in
<PB N="352" REF="372">
her favour than all the eloquence of Cicero could have done: &s;o that Mandragone, having heard his wife out, turning to the Venetian lady, &s;aid,
<Q>What you de&s;ire, Madam, is a very trifling &s;ervice in re&s;pect of many greater I &s;hall be proud to do you, and can without the lea&s;t difficulty. The grand duke, my ma&s;ter, being a prince &s;o gene|rous and benign, that he knows not how to deny any one, provided the reque&s;t be ju&s;t, much more &s;uch a lady as you, being obliged, not only by his natural inclination to goodne&s;s, but al&s;o by the laws of knighthood, to &s;uccour the di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed: be a&s;&s;ured then, that your de&s;ires will be accompli&s;hed.</Q>
And &s;o &s;aying, he took his leave, and went away.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY ON THE Original Inhabitants of GREAT BRITAIN, CONTINUED.</HEAD>
<P>IN the reign of Commodus, or as Beda places it, in the reign of Aurelius, we are told of Lucius, the fir&s;t Briti&s;h monarch who became a chri&s;tian. The legendary &s;tories of him are not in the lea&s;t worthy of in&s;ertion.</P>
<P>In the reign of Septimus Severus, the twenty-fir&s;t emperor of Rome, we learn &s;ome particulars of the old Britons that are too remarkable to be pa&s;&s;ed over. Their per&s;ons and their manners are thus de&s;cribed by Dion Ca&s;&s;ius.</P>
<P>"The two mo&s;t con&s;iderable colonies of Britons are the Caledonians, and the Maeatae. Under the&s;e denominations may be included the re&s;t of the in|habitants. The Maeatae live near the wall that di|vides the i&s;land into two parts; the Caledonians live beyond the wall. Both the&s;e people inhabit the wilde&s;t mountains, where no water is to be found: they al&s;o inhabit de&s;ert plains, and grounds that are full of mar&s;hes: they have neither walls, towns, nor cultivated lands: wild fruits, and the game that they take in hunting are their choice&s;t food: they
<PB N="354" REF="374">
never ta&s;te fi&s;h, although they have great quan|tities<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In their fens.</NOTE>. They pa&s;s their lives in tents, naked, and even without &s;hoes: they live in a promi&s;|cuous manner with their wives: the children are brought up in common: their government is de|mocratical and popular: they take great delight in plunder: they fight in chariots: their hor&s;es are &s;mall, but very &s;wift: they are a people remarkable for velocity in running, and they &s;tand firmly on their legs: their defen&s;ive arms are a buckler and a &s;hort &s;pear; at the lower extremity of the &s;pear is hung an apple made of bra&s;s, with the noi&s;e of which they terrify their enemies in battle: they al&s;o make u&s;e of daggers: they can endure hunger, cold, and every kind of hard&s;hip: they can remain for &s;everal days together in mar&s;hes without eating, and only with their heads above the water. In their woods they feed upon roots, and the bark of trees: they have a certain kind of food <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A food unknown to their po&s;terity.</NOTE> which they prepare upon all occa&s;ions, and of which, if they take a quantity no bigger than the &s;ize of a bean, they no longer feel the effects of hunger, nor of thir&s;t. Such is the i&s;land of Britain."</P>
<P>This mu&s;t not be looked upon either as a per|fect or a general repre&s;entation. It is a mixture of truth, fable, and improbabilities; and it is con|fined entirely to the Caledonians, and to the nor|thern part of Britain. The &s;outhern colonies were nearer the &s;un, and by that &s;ituation, were po&s;&s;ibly of a &s;ofter nature and of a le&s;s robu&s;t con&s;titution. That &s;avages were inclined to rapine and every &s;ort
<PB N="355" REF="375">
of robbery, is by no means a matter of a&s;toni&s;h|ment, and &s;carce a &s;ubject of cen&s;ure; but that the Maeatae and the Caledonii, &s;o late as in the reign of Severus, were totally ignorant of agri|culture, and every rudiment of tillage, mu&s;t appear a &s;hameful in&s;tance of lazine&s;s, if their un&s;ettled &s;ituation, and the want of property and &s;ecurity in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, did not plead their excu&s;e. Cain, the fir&s;t &s;avage upon record, was a tiller of the ground. Noah, as &s;oon as he found him&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the earth, began to be a hu&s;bandman: but Cain had put to death his only adver&s;ary, and Noah was perfectly &s;ecure from foreign inva&s;ions. The di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Britons could not promi&s;e them&s;elves an hour's peace, from enemies and invaders.</P>
<P>Severus had two &s;ons, Ba&s;&s;ianus, &s;irnamed Ca|racalla, and Geta. The luxurious plea&s;ures of Rome had enervated the&s;e young men, and had rendered them, e&s;pecially the elde&s;t, unworthy of &s;uch a fa|ther. To exerci&s;e his army, and to withdraw his &s;ons from a &s;cene of vice and inactivity, the em|peror in the fifteenth year of his reign undertook a journey into Btitain. He was at that time old, infirm, and much afflicted with the gout; but the &s;trength of his &s;pirit was far &s;uperior to the &s;trength of his body: wherever his army marched, he ap|peared at the head of it, on hor&s;eback, or in his chariot, or &s;ometimes, when his di&s;temper was par|ticularly violent, in a litter. His progre&s;s into Caledonia was at the utmo&s;t hazard, and even with a con&s;iderable de&s;truction of his troops. The country was mountainous, woody, and &s;ull of mar&s;hes; &s;o that his &s;oldiers underwent exce&s;&s;ive
<PB N="356" REF="376">
fatigue, without taking a fortre&s;s, and exce&s;&s;ive danger, without &s;eeing an enemy. They had fore&s;ts to cut down, mountains to level, mora&s;&s;es to dry up, and bridges to build. Dio &s;ays, that in this progre&s;s, the Romans lo&s;t fifty thou&s;and men. No di&s;tre&s;&s;es could alarm, no difficulties could deter Severus: he continued his enterprize, and at la&s;t became &s;ucce&s;sful. The terms of an alliance were agreed upon and ratified; but were &s;oon afterwards broken by the Scots: a breach of faith which Seve|rus determined to re&s;ent, not only with rigour, but with inhumanity. He delivered his orders to his army, in the&s;e lines from Homer:
<Q><L>Not one of all the race, nor &s;ex, nor age,</L>
<L>Shall &s;ave a Trojan from our boundle&s;s rage;</L>
<L>Ilion &s;hall peri&s;h whole, and bury all</L>
<L>Her babes, her in&s;ants at the brea&s;t &s;hall fall<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pope's Iliad, b. 6. v. 71.</NOTE>.</L></Q></P>
<P>But he lived not to &s;ee his orders executed: his di&s;temper was his mo&s;t powerful enemy: it con|quered him when he was almo&s;t &s;ixty-&s;even years of age, and when he had reigned about eighteen years, of which the three la&s;t he pa&s;&s;ed in Britain. He died at York, and his funeral ob&s;equies were &s;olemnized with a pomp and magnificence &s;uitable to the character of Severus, and the greatne&s;s of the people of Rome.</P>
<P>The virtues of this emperor were great; how|ever they were not without their alloy. As a pri|vate man, he was covetous; as a commander, he was too &s;u&s;ceptible of revenge. Wherever he con|quered
<PB N="357" REF="377">
he ruined: a cruel di&s;po&s;ition, which the people of Bizantium mo&s;t unhappily experienced, and from which the Scots had a very narrow e&s;cape. On the other hand, his &s;pirit was dauntle&s;s, and &s;uperior not only to danger but fatigue: he defied la&s;&s;itude, and was never wearied by the mo&s;t mi|nute enquiry into every article of his government: to his per&s;onal friends he was extremely grateful: to his per&s;onal enemies he was contemptuou&s;ly di&s;|dainful: he was moderate in his expences as an em|peror, but magnificent in the public buildings of every kind <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">While he was in England he is &s;aid to have built a wall acro&s;s the kingdom; but the antiquaries differ &s;o widely in their accounts of the &s;ituation, materials, and length of it, and &s;ome of them are &s;o doubtful of its exi&s;tence, that it &s;eems rather to have been the wall of Adrian repaired, than any new wall rai&s;ed by Severus.</NOTE>: he heard cau&s;es not only with exact|ne&s;s, but with patience: he entered the courts of ju&s;tice by break of day, and he &s;taid there till noon: his abilities were excellent, and they were improved by learning: he had more than the tenderne&s;s of a father: he forgave Caracalla's repeated attempts upon his life: he was careful in the education of both his &s;ons; and at his death, he jointly be|queathed to them his empire.</P>
<P>Caracalla and his brother Geta, each inferior in every re&s;pect to their father, ha&s;tened from a coun|try of barbarians to that theatre of delicacy, the court of Rome. They concluded a peace with the Caledonians, and left our i&s;land early in the year of Chri&s;t 211.</P>
<P>From henceforward it will be extremely proper to draw a veil over the particular characters of the
<PB N="358" REF="378">
Roman emperors: not even to name their names, unle&s;s where the affairs of Britain require it. The perpetual cha&s;mi in our hi&s;tory happen to be &s;o great, and the anecdotes are &s;o few and trifling, &s;o uncertain or indecent, that till the reign of the joint emperors Diocletianus, and Maximianus, (&s;irnamed Hercu|leus) in the year of Chri&s;t <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Diocle&s;ian was declared emperor, September 17th. A. D. 284; but the hi&s;torians generally agree that he did not ap|point Maximian as his partner in the empire till the year 286.</NOTE> 286, a &s;pace of &s;eventy five years, the deepe&s;t ignorance is &s;carce to be lamented.</P>
<P>The Romans had been many years immer&s;ed in the greate&s;t confu&s;ion: their kingdom was di|vided again&s;t it&s;elf: Britain was &s;till under their &s;ubjection, and was harra&s;&s;ed and torn to pieces by factions and divi&s;ions, which took ri&s;e within the i&s;land it&s;elf. I mean particularly the invin|cible hatred that the Picts and Caledonians, who were now in a manner become one people, bore to the more &s;outhern parts of Britain.</P>
<P>Diocle&s;ian, a man of low birth, had pa&s;&s;ed through many con&s;iderable offices before he was rai&s;ed to the empire: he had acquired a high re|putation as a &s;oldier, and had acquitted him&s;elf with great political &s;agacity in the civil parts of government: his per&s;onal accompli&s;hments &s;eem|ed &s;o &s;uitable to the imperial dignity, that in a time of le&s;s univer&s;al warfare and confu&s;ion, he might &s;ingly have &s;u&s;tained the weight of government, with honour to him&s;elf, and with advantage to the commonwealth. In the pre&s;ent juncture, the hands
<PB N="359" REF="379">
of Briareus were &s;carce too many to hold the reins of the Roman empire: con&s;equently Diocle&s;ian &s;hewed much prudence in gaining the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a partner in the throne. Maximian did not po&s;|&s;e&s;s all the accompli&s;hments of Diocle&s;ian; but he had courage and activity, which were of greater pre&s;ent u&s;e to the public, than virtues more deli|cately illu&s;trious, or more morally refined.</P>
<P>Anarchy and confu&s;ion prevailed throughout the world. The times were &s;uch as are de&s;cribed before the flood, when <HI>God &s;aw that the wickedne&s;s of man was great in the earth; and that every imagi|nation of the thoughts of his heart, was only evil con|tinually</HI> The continent was filled with rebels: the &s;ea was covered by pyrates. In the la&s;t cla&s;s were the Franks and the Saxons, two nations of Germany, who gave continual annoyance to the coa&s;ts of Normandy, Picardy, and Bretagne. To prevent the depredations of the&s;e cor&s;airs, and to awe and &s;ubdue the maritime robbers of every kind, Carau&s;ius was appointed commander of the Roman fleet, and was generally &s;tationed at Bou|logne: a &s;tation near enough the coa&s;t of England, to render him well acquainted with the ports, the &s;hores, and the inhabitants of the i&s;land: he was a man of mean birth <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was a Menapian. The Menapii were a people of the Lower Germany.</NOTE>, but of high ambition: he found him&s;elf at the head of a great fleet; and he was &s;ufficiently wi&s;e to know the weight, power, and dignity of his office: he re&s;olved therefore to ex|tend the limits of his authority in &s;uch a manner,
<PB N="360" REF="380">
as to be the indi&s;putable &s;overeign of the &s;eas; and from thence, to &s;tretch his influence over the land &s;o effectually, as to be a nominal and acknow|ledged emperor of Rome: his methods in pur|&s;uance of his de&s;ign were bold and profligate: he began by a breach of tru&s;t: he &s;eized great numbers of prizes, and he took great numbers of pri&s;oners; but he accounted to him&s;elf alone, not to his imperial ma&s;ters, for the profits of his cap|tors: he permitted Franks, Saxons, or any other pyrates to practice inci&s;criminately all kinds of vi|olence upon the Gallic coa&s;ts; but in their return homewards, he intercepted their ve&s;&s;els, and ap|plied to his own u&s;e the riches and plunder which tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els contained. Such proceedings ju&s;tly alarmed the reigning emperors; and orders were given that Carau&s;ius &s;hould be immediately &s;eized and executed: but he had fore&s;een his danger, and had already &s;ecured to him&s;elf &s;uch an intere&s;t among the officers of the fleet, that the whole navy was unanimou&s;ly determined to obey him.</P>
<P>A mariner only can command mariners: the ele|ment is formed for the people, or rather, the people, like the fi&s;h, are formed for the element. Had Carau&s;ius been a land-officer, all his &s;chemes mu&s;t have proved abortive: but from tho&s;e particulars of his life which have reached our times, he ap|pears to have been as &s;ucce&s;sful as he was wicked, as bold at he was powerful, and as &s;it to command as he was ready to execute.</P>
<P>It is to him we owe the fir&s;t dawnings of our naval power: a power which has &s;ince appeared in all its meridian glory. From his conduct we
<PB N="361" REF="381">
were apprized of our natural &s;trength as an i&s;land: a &s;trength that cannot fail us, if properly exerted, to the end of the world.</P>
<P>Carau&s;ius had mo&s;t judiciou&s;ly fixed his eye upon Britain, as a &s;ure place of refuge and &s;ecurity, whenever the Romans were in pur&s;uit of him; &s;o that as &s;oon as he heard that he had been publicly proclaimed as a traitor, he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Boulogne, and immediately &s;ailed from thence with his whole fleet to the Briti&s;h coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The previous &s;teps which had been taken by Carau&s;ius, and the private corre&s;pondence which he had of late carried on with the Britons, rendered his arrival in the i&s;land not only ea&s;y but joyful. The people came out beyond their &s;hores to meet him, and as &s;oon as he was landed, the Roman legion <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">One Roman legion only, at this time, was quartered in Britain. No more probably could be &s;pared from the con|tinent, which had been of late years in &s;o rebellious, di&s;tre&s;sful, and un&s;ettled a &s;tate.</NOTE>, and the auxiliary troops that had been quartered within the kingdom, acknowledged and &s;aluted him emperor. Thus from a pyrate, he be|came at once a Cae&s;ar, and fulfilled the aphori&s;m, wittily made by one of the Grecian cor&s;airs to Alex|ander the Great, <HI>That a man with a &s;ingle &s;hip was a pyrate, but with a fleet was a great prince</HI></P>
<P>A triumverate of emperors was an unu&s;ual phe|nomenon: but the &s;tate of the continent was &s;o very tottering and precarious, that neither Diocle|&s;ian nor Maximian were in any degree &s;trong enough to di&s;mantle the atchievements of Carau&s;ius.

Some faint preparations of re&s;i&s;tance were attempted by Maximian; but nece&s;&s;ity compelled the Romans &s;oon to withdraw all ho&s;tilities, and to enter into articles of peace: by which inglorious treaty, this proclaimed pyrate was declared Pius; this mari|time robber was acknowledged Felix; and this avowed u&s;urper, was &s;irnamed Augu&s;tus: as ap|pears from the medal in Camden's Britannia, thus in&s;cribed: IMP. C. CARAUSIUS. PF. AUG. on the rever&s;e, PAX AUG. with the letters S C. <HI>Senatus con&s;ulto,</HI> By order of the &s;enate.</P>
<P>Carau&s;ius was not only a nominal emperor of Rome, but he per&s;onally e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf a real monarch of Briton: he reigned and re&s;ided in the i&s;land between &s;ix and &s;even years; and during that time, our ance&s;tors were entirely freed from their obedience to the Roman empire, and were only &s;ubject to the laws and government of their own &s;overeign. Curio&s;ity would lead us to enquire what were the political in&s;titutes of a pyrate. Some civil policy mu&s;t have been regularly main|tained; but no certain records of it are to be di&s;|covered. In general, we know, that his fleet was mighty, and that his marines and &s;ailors were drawn from all nations, and out of all profe&s;&s;ions. In this light as in every other, his abilities mu&s;t appear extraordinary, &s;ince he could keep in &s;ub|jection and obedience a &s;et of people extracted from different kingdoms, and mingled together from various and di&s;tant parts of the world. But before he had compleated the &s;eventh year of his &s;overeign juri&s;diction, he was murdered by Alectus, one of the chief officers in his army.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="383">Alectus &s;eized the government; but his de&s;ire of gra&s;ping the &s;overeignty was far greater than his power of holding it. He maintained his u&s;ur|pation only three years: nor would he have main|tained it &s;o long, if the Romans had not taken that time to con&s;ider in what manner they might recover Britain. Flavius Con&s;tantius Chlorus, who was already emperor elect, and entitled Cae&s;ar, under|took the expedition. As &s;oon as he landed, he burnt his &s;hips; a &s;ure pre&s;age that he was re&s;o|lutely determined upon conque&s;t, or upon death. The Britons were plea&s;ed with the noblene&s;s of this action; and as they were much oppre&s;&s;ed by the dominion of their pre&s;ent tyrant, they re&s;orted in great numbers to the &s;tandard of Con&s;tantine, and voluntarily enli&s;ted them&s;elves into his &s;ervice. A battle en&s;ued, in which Alectus was &s;lain. His army was mo&s;tly compo&s;ed of Franks, and &s;uch of them who e&s;caped from the furious &s;laughter of the Romans, retired to London, de&s;perately de|termined to pillage that city, and immediately to &s;ail away with their plunder. But the de&s;ign was fru&s;trated by a reinforcement of Romans, who landed at London at this important cri&s;is, and who immediately put almo&s;t every one of the Franks to the &s;word. Thus was the chief city of our i&s;land delivered from rapine and de&s;truction, and the i&s;land it&s;elf again &s;ubjected to the empire of Rome. Con|&s;tantine made an expedition into the northern parts of Britain, to e&s;tabli&s;h under the Roman govern|ment, tho&s;e colonies which were mo&s;t mutinous, and untractable. He &s;taid about four years in the kingdom, and then returned to Italy, leaving be|hind

him the &s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, and the true&s;t veneration of his many remarkable virtues, parti|cularly of his clemency and his ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Con&s;tantine arrived at Rome, Dio|cle&s;ian and Maximian wearied with the weight of government, and de&s;irous to retire from the pomp and fatigue of bu&s;ine&s;s, re&s;igned the empire to him and to Galerius Armentarius. The king|doms which fell to the &s;hare of Con&s;tantine, were Italy, Spain, Africa, and Gaul; to which latter was always annexed the i&s;land of Britain. Con&s;tantine preferred it to any part of the continent; and the Britons, who had already experienced many in&s;tances of his goodne&s;s and protection, were much rejoiced at his return. He made York his &s;eat of re&s;i|dence, and died there in the year 306, in the 56th year of his age.</P>
<P>He was &s;ucceeded by his elde&s;t &s;on, Con&s;tan|tinus, &s;irnamed the Great: a pa&s;&s;age in Eumenius, allows room to imagine, that this &s;econd Con&s;tan|tine was born in Britain. The words of the pane|gyri&s;t are the&s;e; <HI>O fortunata et nunc omnibus beatior terris Britannia, quae Con&s;tantinum Cae&s;arem prima vidi&s;ti!</HI>
<Q>O fortunate Britain! now happier than all other parts of the earth, &s;ince in your i&s;land Con&s;tantine Cae&s;ar was fir&s;t beheld.</Q>
His birth was undoubtedly an honour to the country in which he was born: but the actions of his life are the points mo&s;t important to hi&s;tory. Bi&s;hop Stilling|fleet tells us from Lactantius, that one of Con&s;tan|tine's fir&s;t acts of government, was <HI>to &s;ecure full liberty to the Chri&s;tians</HI> From this reign we may
<PB N="365" REF="385">
date the open and triumphant appearance of Chri|&s;tianity in Britain. All accounts till this time &s;eem dark and intricate; the &s;tories of king Lucius and his twenty-eight churches are fabulous and im|probable. The Britons had their Druids, the Ro|mans had their Flamines, and each had their Ponti|fex Maximus. Thus idolatry in two different forms of wor&s;hip was prevalent throughout the whole i&s;land, till Con&s;tantine the Great declared him&s;elf a Chri&s;tian. He had been educated in that faith by his mother Helena, who is recorded as a &s;aint of the fir&s;t magnitude, in the eccle&s;ia&s;tic chronicles of the pontifical church of Rome.</P>
<P>The example of a &s;overeign will always have a powerful influence upon his people. Con&s;tantine, by his public declaration of the chri&s;tian faith, gave a mortal blow to idolatry; and the Flamines and the Druids melted away before the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, like waxen images before the &s;un.</P>
<P>Alterations of another kind were in&s;tituted in the &s;tate. They are at pre&s;ent of little con&s;e|quence: changes of names, as from Propraetor to Vicarius, or different divi&s;ions of the kingdom; &s;uch as making the two provinces three, or as &s;ome &s;ay, four, and all particulars &s;o differently told, that they mu&s;t rather weary than entertain a reader. It is in a great mea&s;ure to &s;ave the many fatiguing accounts, where neither exactne&s;s nor in|&s;truction can be found, that the&s;e papers have been put together; which, if not &s;ufficiently minute, and &s;atisfactory to the per&s;ons into who&s;e hands they may fall, will be always amply dilated and &s;upplied

by a &s;earch into the many folio volumes that load all the hi&s;torical &s;helves in England.</P>
<P>Many &s;cenes of Con&s;tantine's greate&s;t actions were performed in France and Germany. He en|tirely &s;ubdued the Franks, who were become powerful and numerous: they inhabited that part of Gaul, which from them was called Franconia, or Francia Orientalis. He cro&s;&s;ed the Rhine, and laid wa&s;te the country of the Bructeri; and he re|moved the &s;eat of empire from Rome to Con&s;tan|tinople. He died May the 22d, in the year of Chri&s;t 337.</P>
<P>From the acce&s;&s;ion of Diocle&s;ian in the year 284, or rather from the &s;eizure of the i&s;land by Carau&s;ius in the year 287, to the death of Con&s;tantine in 337, the Britons had made very great improvements in their mercantile trade, and in various arts and &s;ciences <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Paneg. Maximian.</NOTE>. This la&s;t half century was of more be|nefit to the i&s;land, than all the years that had pa&s;|&s;ed before. As the &s;trength and power of antient Rome dimini&s;hed, the &s;trength and power of Britain encrea&s;ed; and the inhabitants were no longer looked upon or treated as &s;laves or &s;avages, but as allies and confederates of the Roman &s;tate.</P>

No di&s;turbances, no in&s;urrections aro&s;e throughout the whole reign of Con&s;tantine the Great. It may be asked from
<PB N="367" REF="387">
what motives this obedience, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Roman power, or rather let us &s;ay, to the will of Providence, could ari&s;e? Certainly from the flouri&s;hing condition of the Chri&s;tian religion, the doctrines of which it is to be hoped were then preached and practi&s;ed in &s;ome degree of purity.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t dangers, or the mo&s;t &s;udden mole|&s;tations, to which the Britons were at this time li|able, proceeded &s;olely from their neighbours the Caledonians, who in the beginning of Con&s;tantine's government, or ju&s;t before the death of his father Con&s;tantine the fir&s;t, had made &s;everal rapacious in|cur&s;ions beyond their borders. They were &s;oon conquered by Con&s;tantine the &s;econd, and driven back to their inmo&s;t bounds; and they remained tolerably quiet during that Emperor's reign.</P>

<P>IT is owing to ignorance that a girl is weary of her&s;elf, and knows not how to relieve that languor by innocent employments: when &s;he is arrived to a certain age without ever having ap|plied to things &s;olid, &s;he is void of ta&s;te or e&s;teem for them; every thing &s;erious is &s;ad; every thing that requires a continued attention is fatigue; the bia&s;s of plea&s;ure, &s;o &s;trong in the days of youth; the example of other per&s;ons of the &s;ame age, plunged in amu&s;ement, tends to create an abhor|rence of a life of regularity and diligence. In the&s;e early days, &s;he wants the experience and authority nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uperintending any thing in her fa|ther's hou&s;e; &s;he is not &s;o much as &s;en&s;ible of what importance it is to apply her&s;elf that way, unle&s;s her mother has happened to take care to point out to her the &s;everal particulars. Is &s;he of rank? &s;he is exempt from working with her hands: &s;he will not work therefore, except for &s;ome little time in

the day, becau&s;e &s;he was heard &s;ay, &s;he knows not why, that it is reputable for ladies to do &s;ome|thing: but this is often mere pretence; &s;he cannot accu&s;tom her&s;elf to application.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation what will &s;he do? The company of a mother who watches all her motions, and is chid|ing her ince&s;&s;antly, who thinks &s;he brings her up well in excu&s;ing nothing, who looks grave upon her, who forces her to endure her humours, who &s;eems ever burdened with dome&s;tic cares, is what both con|&s;trains and di&s;pirits her; &s;he has about her a &s;et of flattering females, who, with a view to in&s;inuate them&s;elves, by a ba&s;e and pernicious complacency, fall in with all her fancies, and entertain her with every thing that is likely to give di&s;ta&s;te to what is right. Piety appears a tire&s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s, a rule incompatible with every idea of plea&s;ure. What then will &s;he be doing? Nothing &s;erviceable; and this very inapplication grows at length into an in|curable habit. In the mean time, behold a void which there is no hopes of filling up with things &s;olid; therefore the frivolous mu&s;t take place. In this idle &s;tate, a young lady abandons her&s;elf to la|zine&s;s, the languor of the &s;oul, and inexhau&s;tible &s;ource of irk&s;omene&s;s.</P>
<P>She u&s;es her&s;elf to more &s;leep than is confident with true health: this &s;erves but to weaken her, to make her tender and more liable to bodily indi&s;po&s;i|tion; whereas moderate &s;leep, with the u&s;e of regular exerci&s;e, produces liveline&s;s, vigour, and &s;trength, in which undoubtedly a perfect &s;tate of body con|&s;i&s;ts, not to mention the advantages re&s;ulting to the mind.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="390">From this union of &s;oftne&s;s and idlene&s;s, with ignorance, proceeds a pernicious &s;en&s;ibility for di|ver&s;ions and public &s;hews; nay, it excites an in|di&s;creet and in&s;atiable curio&s;ity. People ver&s;ed and occupied in things of a &s;erious nature, have in general but a moderate degree of curio&s;ity; the knowledge they po&s;&s;e&s;s gives them a con|tempt for many things they do not know; they perceive the inutility, the ridiculou&s;ne&s;s of the mo&s;t part of tho&s;e things which little minds that know nothing, and have nothing to do, are eager to be acquainted with: on the contrary, the ima|gination of girls, ill in&s;tructed and unattentive, is perpetually wandering for want of &s;olid nouri&s;h|ment; their curio&s;ity turns with eagerne&s;s upon objects of an empty and dangerous nature. Tho&s;e of genius &s;et them&s;elves up for <HI>extraordinary wo|men,</HI> and read all the books that can feed their vanity; they are pa&s;&s;ionately fond of romances, of plays, of &s;tories, of chimerical adventures, wherewith much profane love is intermixed; they give a vi&s;ionary turn to their under&s;tanding, by u&s;ing it to the magnificent language of the heroes of romance; they even &s;poil them&s;elves for the world, becau&s;e all the&s;e fine airy &s;entiments, the&s;e generous pa&s;&s;ions, the&s;e adventures which the au|thor of the romance has invented merely to plea&s;e, have not the lea&s;t relation to the real motives of action in the world, or to tho&s;e that decide its af|fairs, nor yet to the fal&s;e views di&s;coverable in every undertaking.</P>
<P>A poor girl, full of the tender and the marvel|lous which have &s;o charmed her in her &s;tudies, is

<HEAD>CHAP. III. What are the fir&s;t Grounds of Education.</HEAD>
<P>TOwards remedying all the&s;e evils, it is of great advantage to be able to begin the education of girls from their earlie&s;t infancy. That age which is often given up to the direction of women indi&s;|crete, and &s;ometimes depraved, is neverthele&s;s the age which receives the deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, and which con&s;equently affects their whole life.</P>
<P>Infants, before they can &s;peak plain, may be prepared for in&s;truction: &s;ome may think this is &s;aying too much; let us only con&s;ider what a child does before it can &s;peak: it learns a language,
<PB N="372" REF="392">
which it will &s;hortly &s;peak with more accuracy than &s;cholars can the dead languages they have &s;o painfully &s;tudied in riper years. Now what is learning a language? is it not to regi&s;ter in the memory a great number of words? It is moreover, &s;aith Augu&s;tin, to ob&s;erve the &s;en&s;e of each of tho&s;e words: an infant, &s;aith he, amid&s;t its noi&s;es and play, takes notice of what object each word is the &s;ign, and this he does &s;ometimes by ob&s;erving the natural motion of bodies that come into con|tact, or that &s;hew the objects &s;poken of; &s;ome|times by being &s;truck with the frequent repeti|tion of the &s;ame words, denoting the &s;ame objects: true it is, the temperament of the brain of infants affords a wonderful facility for receiving all the&s;e images; but how great attention of mind mu&s;t there be to di&s;tingui&s;h and connect them each with its object?</P>
<P>Con&s;ider next how much infants, even at that age, take to tho&s;e who humour them, and di&s;like tho&s;e who oppo&s;e them: how well they know when to cry and when to be &s;till, in order to gain their ends: how cunning, how jealous they can be even at this time. I have &s;een, &s;aith Au&s;tin, a child full of jealou&s;y; though not yet able to &s;peak, he eyed with furious looks, and a pale countenance, the child that &s;ucked along with him. Hence then one may conclude that they have more &s;en&s;e at that time than is generally &s;uppo&s;ed; &s;o that it is po&s;|&s;ible by means of words, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by proper tones and ge&s;tures, to give them an inclination rather to be with the decent and virtuous part of tho&s;e they &s;ee, than with other indi&s;crete per&s;ons whom they
<PB N="373" REF="393">
may be in danger of loving. Thus by the different air of your face and tone of voice, may you repre|&s;ent to them with horror the behaviour of per&s;ons, they have beheld in a tran&s;port of anger, or any other di&s;order; and, on the other hand, a&s;&s;uming the &s;ofte&s;t tones and accents, and milde&s;t looks, act over with admiration whatever pa&s;&s;ages they have &s;een, wherein wi&s;dom and mode&s;ty were ob&s;ervable.</P>
<P>I do not mean to &s;et forth the&s;e little matters for important, but yet &s;uch di&s;tant preparations are beginnings not to be neglected; and this early prevention &s;en&s;ibly forms them to receive their education. If there remains any doubt of the in|fluence of fir&s;t prejudices upon men, let us but ob&s;erve how lively, how affecting, the remembrance of things we loved in our childhood, remains in our advanced age: if, in&s;tead of in&s;piring children with vain terrors of apparitions and &s;pirits, which by too violently &s;hocking the brain, yet tender, &s;erves only to weaken it; if in&s;tead of &s;uffering them to be directed by every fancy of their nur&s;es, to objects of their love or aver&s;ion, we were to make it our care to give them a plea&s;ant idea of what is good, and a frightful one of whatever is evil, this pre|vention would in its con&s;equence greatly facilitate their progre&s;s in all the virtues. Quite contrary to this, they are taught to be frightned at a prie&s;t dre&s;|&s;ed in black; the word Death is never mentioned unle&s;s to &s;care them; they are told how dead people walk at night in horrible &s;hapes; the con&s;equence of all which is to make the mind weak and fearful, and prejudice it again&s;t better things.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="394">In the fir&s;t years of infancy, no greater &s;ervice can be done the child than to manage its health; to endeavour to furni&s;h it with a mild blood, by a well cho&s;en diet, and &s;imple regimen; &s;o to re|gulate its meals that it may eat nearly at the &s;ame hours, and as often as is requi&s;ite; but not between meals, for that is loading the &s;tomach again before dige&s;tion is perfected; not to eat &s;ea&s;oned things, that will provoke him to eat more than he has oc|ca&s;ion for, and give a di&s;reli&s;h for the &s;ort of victuals mo&s;t whol&s;ome for him; in fine, not to &s;upply him with variety, for a variety of food in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion keeps up the appetite after genuine hunger is &s;ati&s;|fied.</P>
<P>Another thing of great moment is to wait till the organs are grown &s;trong, without pre&s;&s;ing in|&s;truction upon him; to avoid all occa&s;ions of rowz|ing the pa&s;&s;ions; to u&s;e him, with gentlene&s;s, to be|ing deprived of &s;uch things as he has &s;hewn him&s;elf too eager for, this will prevent the confidence of obtaining his de&s;ires.&mdash;If their di&s;po&s;itions be in any degree good, it is po&s;&s;ible by the&s;e means to render them docile, patient, &s;teady, gay, and tran|quil: on the contrary, where this early age is ne|glected, they become violent and re&s;tle&s;s all their lives, their blood heats, habits are formed in the young and tender body; the &s;oul as yet unbia&s;&s;ed takes a bent to evil, a &s;ort of &s;econd original-&s;in &s;prings up, which is to prove the &s;ource of a thou|&s;and di&s;orders, as they grow bigger. From the moment they arrive at the age wherein rea&s;on has unfolded it&s;elf, nothing &s;hould be &s;aid but what has
<PB N="375" REF="395">
a tendency to give them a love for virtue, and a contempt of all di&s;&s;imulation: therefore ought we to u&s;e no feints, in order to appea&s;e and bring them to do as we would have them; for that would be to teach them a cunning they will never forget: let us as much as po&s;&s;ible lead them on by rea&s;on.</P>
<P>We will take a nearer view of the &s;tate of infants, in order to &s;ee more particularly what is proper for them: the &s;ub&s;tance of their brain is very &s;oft, it hardens day by day; as for their mind it knows no|thing: this &s;oftne&s;s of brain is the rea&s;on why every thing makes &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions, as is the &s;urpri&s;e of noveity why they are &s;o apt to admire and be in|qui&s;itive. It is al&s;o true, that the brain by its humi|dity and &s;oftne&s;s, together with much heat, is given to be in continual motion; whence proceeds that re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s in children, whereby they can no more confine their minds to one object than their bodies to one place: on the other hand, infants, while yet incapable of thought or action of them&s;elves, re|mark all that pa&s;&s;es, and they &s;peak but little, un|le&s;s we u&s;e them to talk much, which we ought carefully to avoid doing; for the plea&s;ure taken in pretty children helps frequently to &s;poil them. We accu&s;tom them to venture to &s;peak whatever comes into their thoughts, and of things of which hither|to they have no di&s;tinct comprehen&s;ion: from this they acquire a la&s;ting habit of judging with preci|pitation, and of talking on &s;ubjects of which they have no clear ideas; this forms a mind of a very bad &s;tamp&mdash;this plea&s;ure has yet another effect, a pernicious one, children perceiving that people look on them with complacency, take notice of all
<PB N="376" REF="396">
they do, and are plea&s;ed to hear all they &s;ay, get a cu&s;tom of believing they &s;hall ever be the concern of the world. During this age of applau&s;e, and unacquainted with contradiction, chimerical hopes are conceived, which open a way for infinite mi&s;takes through life. I have known children, who, whenever per&s;ons were talking in private, always concluded they were the &s;ubject, becau&s;e they had ob&s;erved it to be often &s;o; they imagined every thing in them&s;elves to be extraordinary and ad|mirable: therefore they ought to be taken care of, without being &s;uffered to know that we think much about them; &s;hew them that it is out of kindne&s;s, and through their great need of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, not from any admiration of their qualities, that we are &s;o attentive to their conduct.</P>
<P>Be content to form them &s;tep by &s;tep, as occa|&s;ions naturally offer. Even when it is po&s;&s;ible to bring the under&s;tanding of a child very forward without &s;urcharging it, we &s;hould be cautious of doing this; for the danger of vanity and pre&s;ump|tion is always greater than the fruits of theie forc'd educations, that make &s;o much noi&s;e.</P>
<P>We &s;hould be content I &s;ay, to follow and a&s;&s;i&s;t nature; we &s;hould not urge them to talk. As they are very ignorant, they have a multitude of que&s;|tions to a&s;k, and do ask a great many; &s;uffice it to an&s;wer them with preci&s;ion, adding &s;ometimes cer|tain little compari&s;ons, to make our explanations the ea&s;ier comprehended. If they pa&s;s judgment upon any thing without thoroughly under&s;tanding it, embarra&s;s them by &s;ome new que&s;tion, which may &s;hew them their fault, without roughly con|founding
<PB N="377" REF="397">
them; and at the &s;ame time, one &s;hould let them &s;ee, not by vague commendations, but by &s;ome effectual mark of e&s;teem, that we much more approve of their doubting and enquiring into what they are ignorant of, than of their very be&s;t deci|&s;ions.</P>

<P>As &s;oon as their rea&s;on has apparently made &s;ome progre&s;s, it will be proper to make u&s;e of that very experience to arm them again&s;t pre&s;ump|tion.

You would have been much to blame in pretending to know what was then out of your reach; and thus it is with regard to things you are &s;till to learn: hereafter you will di&s;cover how im|perfect your pre&s;ent judgment is; in the mean time rely upon the judgment of tho&s;e who judge now as your&s;elf will do, when arrived at their age and experience.</P>
<P>The natural curio&s;ity of children is the forerun|ner of in&s;truction; fail not to profit by it, for exam|ple, in the country they &s;ee a windmill, and want to know what it is, we ought to de&s;cribe to them by what method the food of man is prepared. They

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE COUNT DE COMMINGE CONTINUED.</HEAD>
<P><Q>I Would die, &s;aid I, rather than di&s;plea&s;e you; and I will die if you have no pity on me. What can I do? It is ea&s;ier for me to take away my own life, than to forget Adelaida. Shall I be perjured, and violate the vows I have made to her? vows which have engaged her early af|fections. Shall I abandon her when I know I have gained her heart? Oh! my dear mother, do not wi&s;h your &s;on to become the ba&s;e&s;t of men.</Q></P>
<P>I then related to her all that had pa&s;&s;ed between us.
<Q>She loves you, &s;aid I, and you, I am &s;ure, will not be able to help loving her. She has your &s;weetne&s;s, your candour, your genero|&s;ity. How is it po&s;&s;ible for me to cea&s;e loving her?</Q></P>
<P><Q>But what do you propo&s;e by indulging this pa&s;&s;ion, &s;aid my mother? Your father is re&s;olved to have you marry another, and commands you to retire into the country till everything is &s;ettled.
<PB N="380" REF="400">
It is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that you &s;hould appear willing to obey him, unle&s;s you mean to be my death. He expects you will depart to-morrow under the conduct of a per&s;on in whom he has great confidence. Ab&s;ence will do more for you than you can yet imagine; but be that as it will, do not irritate Mon&s;ieur de Comminge &s;till more by your refu&s;al: a&s;k for time, and I will do every thing in my power to accompli&s;h your wi&s;hes. Your father's anger cannot la&s;t always: he will relent, and you may be yet happy; but you have been greatly to blame in burning the writings. He is per&s;uaded that you &s;acrificed them to madame de Lu&s;&s;an, who ordered her daughter to require that proof of your love.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Oh heavens! cried I, is it po&s;&s;ible that my father can be &s;o unju&s;t? Both madame de Lu&s;|&s;an and Adelaida are ignorant of what I have done; and I am very &s;ure, had they &s;u&s;pected my intention, they would have u&s;ed all their power over me to have prevented it.</Q></P>
<P>My mother and I afterwards took mea&s;ures to convey letters to each other, and, encouraged by her indulgence, I dur&s;t pre&s;ume to intreat &s;he would tran&s;mit to me tho&s;e of Adelaida, who was &s;oon to be at Bourdeaux. My mother had the goodne&s;s to promi&s;e &s;he would gratify me; but at the &s;ame time; in&s;i&s;ted, that if I found Adelaida had altered her &s;entiments, I &s;hould &s;ubmit to what my fa|ther required of me. We &s;pent great part of the night in this conver&s;ation; and as &s;oon as day appeared my conductor came to inform me that it was time to set on hor&s;eback.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="401">The e&s;tate where I was to pa&s;s the time of my bani&s;hment lay in the mountains, &s;ome leagues from Bagniers; &s;o that we took the &s;ame road I had &s;o lately pa&s;&s;ed through. The &s;econd day of our journey we came early in the evening to the village where we were to lie. While &s;upper was preparing I went to take a walk along the great road, and at a di&s;tance &s;aw a coach which drove very fa&s;t, and when it came within a few paces of me overturned. My heart, by its throbbing, acquainted me with the part I had in this accident. I eagerly flew towards the coach; two men on hor&s;eback, who attended it, alighted and joined me, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the per&s;ons who were within. It will be ea&s;ily gue&s;&s;ed that tho&s;e per&s;ons were Adelaida and her mother; in effect it was they. Adelaida was very much hurt in one of her feet; but the joy at &s;eeing me &s;eemed to leave her no &s;en&s;e of her pain.</P>
<P>What plea&s;ure did I ta&s;te that happy moment! After &s;o many afflictions, and at the di&s;tance of &s;o many years, it is &s;till pre&s;ent to my remembrance. Adelaida not being able to walk, I took her in my arms to carry her to the inn; her charming arms were thrown round my neck, and one of her hands touched my mouth. I was in a tran&s;port that &s;carce &s;uffered me to breathe.</P>
<P>Adelaida ob&s;erved it, her delicacy was alarmed, &s;he made a motion to di&s;ingage her&s;elf from my arms. Alas! how little did &s;he know the exce&s;s of my love: I was too much tran&s;ported with my pre&s;ent happine&s;s to think there was any beyond it.</P>
<P><Q>Set me down, &s;aid &s;he to me, in a low and trembling voice; I believe I am able to walk.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="382" REF="402">
<Q>What, replied I, are you &s;o cruel as to envy me the only good fortune I &s;hall perhaps ever enjoy.</Q>
I pre&s;t her hand tenderly to my bo&s;om as I pronounced the&s;e words. Adelaida was &s;ilent, and a fal&s;e &s;tep which I made on purpo&s;e, obliged her to re&s;ume her fir&s;t attitude.</P>
<P>The inn was at &s;o little di&s;tance, that I was &s;oon forced to part with my beauteous burden. I carried her into a room, and laid her on a bed; while their attendants did the &s;ame with her mother, who was much more hurt than Adelaida. Every one being bu&s;y about madame de Lu&s;&s;an, I had time to ac|quaint Adelaida with part of what had pa&s;&s;ed be|tween my father and me. I &s;uppre&s;t the article of the burnt writings. I knew not whether I mo&s;t wi&s;hed that me &s;hould be ignorant of it, or know it from another per&s;on; it was in &s;ome degree impo&s;ing upon her the nece&s;&s;ity of loving me, and I was de&s;irous of owing all to her own heart. I dur&s;t not de&s;cribe my father to her &s;uch as he really was. Adelaida was &s;trictly virtuous; and I was &s;en&s;ible, that to re&s;ign her&s;elf to the in|clinations &s;he felt for me, it was nece&s;&s;ary that &s;he &s;hould hope we might be one day united. I &s;eemed to have great dependance upon my mother's ten|derne&s;s for me, and the favourable di&s;po&s;ition &s;he was in towards us. I intreated Adelaida to &s;ee her.</P>
<P><Q>Speak to my mother, &s;aid &s;he; &s;he knows your &s;entiments, I have acknowledged mine to her. I found that her authority was nece&s;&s;ary to give me &s;trength to combat them if I &s;hould be ob|liged to it, or to ju&s;tify me for re&s;igning my&s;elf up to them without &s;cruple. She will u&s;e her
<PB N="383" REF="403">
utmo&s;t endeavours to prevail upon my father to propo&s;e an accommodation, and to engage the interpo&s;ition of our common relations for that purpo&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>The tranquillity with which Adelaida re&s;ted upon the&s;e hopes made me feel my misfortune more &s;en&s;ibly.
<Q>What if our fathers &s;hould be inex|orable, &s;aid I to her, pre&s;&s;ing her hand, will not you have compa&s;&s;ion on a mi&s;erable wretch who adores you?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I will do all that I can, an&s;wered &s;he, to regu|late my inclinations by my duty; but I feel that I &s;hall be wretched, if that duty is again&s;t you.</Q></P>
<P>The per&s;ons who had been employed about Madame de Lu&s;&s;an then approaching her daughter, our di&s;cour&s;e was interrupted. I went to the bed-&s;ide of the mother; &s;he received me kindly, and a&s;|&s;ured me &s;he would u&s;e every method in her power to reconcile our families. I then went out of their chamber to leave them at liberty to take &s;ome re|po&s;e. My conductor, who waited for me in my own apartment, had made no enquiry about the&s;e new gue&s;ts; &s;o that I had an opportunity of being a few moments with Adelaida before I proceeded on my journey.</P>
<P>I entered her chamber in a condition ea&s;ier to be imagined than de&s;cribed. I dreaded that this was the la&s;t time I &s;hould &s;ee her. I approached the mother fir&s;t, my grief pleaded for me, and &s;he was &s;o moved with it, that &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf in &s;till kinder terms than &s;he had done the evening before. Adelaida was at another end of the room; I went
<PB N="384" REF="404">
to her trembling: "I leave you my dear Adelaida," &s;aid I. Two or three times I repeated the &s;ame words: my tears, which I could not re&s;train, &s;poke the re&s;t. She wept likewi&s;e.</P>
<P><Q>I &s;hew you my whole heart, &s;aid &s;he&mdash;I do not wi&s;h to di&s;gui&s;e it from you; you de&s;erve my tenderne&s;s. I know not what will be our fate; but I am re&s;olved that my parents &s;hall di&s;po&s;e of mine.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And why, replied I, &s;hould we &s;ubject our|&s;elves to the tyranny of our parents? let us leave them to hate each other, if they will do it; and let us fly to &s;ome di&s;tant corner of the world, and be happy in our mutual tenderne&s;s, which we may make a &s;uperior duty to what we owe them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Never let me hear &s;uch a propo&s;al from you again, &s;aid &s;he: give me not cau&s;e to repent of the &s;entiments I have entertained for you; my love may make me unhappy, but it &s;hall never make me criminal. Adieu, added &s;he, giving me her hand, it is by our con&s;tancy and virtue that we ought to endeavour to triumph over our misfortunes, but whatever happens, let us re|&s;olve to do nothing which may le&s;&s;en our e&s;teem for each other.</Q></P>
<P>While &s;he &s;poke, I killed the dear hand &s;he had given me: I bathed it with my tears.
<Q>I mu&s;t always love you, replied I; death, if I cannot be yours, will free me from my mi&s;ery.</Q></P>
<P>My heart was &s;o oppre&s;s'd with angui&s;h, that I could with difficulty utter the&s;e few words. I ha&s;tily quitted the room, and mounting my hor&s;e, arrived
<PB N="385" REF="405">
at the place where we were to dine, without having one moment cea&s;ed to weep. I gave free cour&s;e to my tears. I found a kind of &s;weetne&s;s in thus indulging my grief. When the heart is truly af|fected, it takes plea&s;ure in every thing that di&s;|covers to it&s;elf its own &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>The remainder of our journey pa&s;&s;ed as the be|ginning: I had &s;carce uttered a word during the whole time. On the third day we arrived at a ca&s;tle built near the Pyrenees; nothing was to be &s;een about it but pines and Cyprus trees, &s;teep rocks, and horrid precipices; and nothing heard but the noi&s;e of torrents ru&s;hing with violence down tho&s;e frightful declivities.</P>
<P>This &s;avage dwelling plea&s;ed me, becau&s;e it &s;oothed my melancholy. I pa&s;&s;ed whole days in the woods; and when I returned, unloaded my &s;ad heart in letters to my beloved Adelaida. This was my only employment, and my only plea&s;ure. I will give them to her one day, thought I: &s;he &s;hall &s;ee by them how I have pa&s;&s;ed the time in her ab&s;ence. I &s;ometimes received letters from my mother, in one of which &s;he gave me hopes. Alas! that was the only happy moment I ever en|joyed: &s;he informed me that all our relations were labouring to reconcile our families, and that there was room to believe they would &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>After this I received no more letters for &s;ix weeks; how tedious were tho&s;e days of doubt and anxiety! every morning I went into the road through which the me&s;&s;engers pa&s;&s;ed, and never re|turned till it was late in the evening: lingering
<PB N="386" REF="406">
till hope and expectation had nothing left to feed upon, and always returned more wretched than when I fir&s;t &s;et out. At length I &s;aw a man at a di&s;tance, riding towards the ca&s;tle. I did not doubt but he was a me&s;&s;enger to me, and, in&s;tead of that eager impatience I had felt a moment before, I was now &s;eized with apprehen&s;ion and dread. I dur&s;t not advance to meet him; &s;omething which I could not account for, re&s;trained me. Uncertainty, which had hitherto appeared &s;o tormenting, &s;eemed now a good which I feared to lo&s;e.</P>
<P>My heart did not deceive me. This man brought me letters from my mother, in which &s;he informed me, that my father would li&s;ten to no propo&s;als for an accommodation; and, to com|pleat my mi&s;eries, had re&s;olved upon a marri|age between me and a daughter of the hou&s;e of Foix: that the nuptials were to be celebrated in the ca&s;tle where I then was; and that my father would in a few days come him&s;elf to prepare me for what he de&s;ired of me.</P>
<P>You will ea&s;ily judge I did not balance a mo|ment about the re&s;olution I was to take. I waited for my father's arrival with tranquility enough. My grief was &s;oothed with the reflection, that I was able to make another &s;acrifice to Adelaida: I was convinced &s;he loved me: I loved her too much to doubt it. True love is always full of confidence.</P>
<P>My mother, who had &s;o many rea&s;ons for wi&s;h|ing to &s;ee me di&s;engaged from Adelaida, had never in any of her letters given me the lea&s;t cau&s;e to
<PB N="387" REF="407">
&s;u&s;pect &s;he was changed; this compleated my &s;ecurity. How greatly did the con&s;tancy of my Adelaida heighten the ardor of my pa&s;&s;ion! Du|ring the three days which elap&s;ed before the ar|rival of my father, my imagination was wholly em|ployed on the new proof I was &s;hortly to give Adelaida of my pa&s;&s;ion. This idea, notwith&s;tand|ing my mi&s;erable &s;ituation, gave me &s;en&s;ations little different from joy.</P>

<HEAD>PHILOSOPHY FOR THE LADIES CONTINUED.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the methods NATURE has furni&s;hed various ANIMALS withal, to elude the attacks of, and prevent pur&s;uits from, their enemies.</HEAD>
<P>IN our la&s;t Number we gave &s;ome account of a remarkable artifice, made u&s;e of by a very &s;mall animal, to entrap and get into his power &s;uch crea|tures as are his proper prey; and which, by being provided either with wings, or with a &s;uperior &s;hare of agility, would be otherwi&s;e out of the reach of his attacks. Were we to proceed in relating the various contrivances peculiar to each &s;everal &s;pecies of animals for the di&s;covering, en&s;naring, and over|coming their re&s;pective enemies, or catching their de&s;tined prey, we &s;hould greatly encroach on the limits of the plan we have determined to proceed on, of not dwelling too long on any one &s;ubject. Various, therefore as they are, and entertaining and curious as the knowledge of them may be, we &s;hall refer
<PB N="389" REF="409">
an account of them to &s;ome future periods, in which they may, perhaps, find place with a greater degree of variety; and proceed in this to relate the oppo&s;ite gift of nature, who, provident and careful of all her works, has, together with every convenience for the procuring of &s;u&s;tenance, and for the attack|ing of tho&s;e enemies which &s;tand in &s;ome rank of equality, al&s;o furni&s;hed almo&s;t every creature with the means of either eluding the &s;earch, or e&s;caping from the &s;eizure of &s;uch as are more powerful.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e methods are general, others par|ticular. The more general means by which diffe|rent animals elude the &s;earch of their powerful and de&s;tructive enemies, are the &s;everal cells, caverns, ne&s;ts, and covertures, which nature has taught the different genera of them to find out, and to repair to for &s;helter, as well again&s;t their de&s;troyers, as again&s;t the &s;everal inclemencies and dangers of the weather. The general a&s;&s;i&s;tances which they meet with for e&s;caping from imminent danger, when attacked, is &s;ome peculiar degree of agility, either in running, leaping, flying, or &s;wimming; for which &s;everal purpo&s;es certain cla&s;&s;es of animals are found to be furni&s;hed with a particular appara|tus and mechani&s;m, &s;uch as mo&s;t ju&s;tly demand our admiration, and bear the &s;tronge&s;t te&s;timony to Almighty wi&s;dom. Yet the&s;e are &s;till properties in common to numbers, even of different &s;pecies, bearing only &s;ome trivial differences peculiar to in|dividuals; but there are other methods, in which the Creator has thought proper to di&s;tingui&s;h his care for the pre&s;ervation of his creatures, and which are &s;ome of them limited to particular ge|nera
<PB N="390" REF="410">
of animals, and others ab&s;olutely confined to &s;eparate individuals.</P>
<P>Of this &s;ort, there is none that we find more frequent than the being endowed with a pro|perty of a&s;&s;uming, either in colour or form, the ge|neral appearance of &s;urrounding objects, in &s;uch manner, that being blended and confu&s;ed with them, a di&s;tant eye is rendered incapable of di&s;|cerning them: and this property we ever find more or le&s;s be&s;towed on tho&s;e creatures who&s;e natural manner of living obliges them to range abroad for their food in places devoid of &s;helter; and therefore become the more continually expo&s;ed to the attacks of their adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>Thus do we find in Greenland, Nova Zembla, and the colder countries within the polar circles, that in the winter &s;ea&s;on, when the whole region is co|vered with indi&s;&s;oluble &s;now, the hares, rabbits, foxes, &amp;c. who, by that means are deprived of their accu&s;tomed &s;helter, and would therefore be|come an ea&s;y prey to the larger animals, change the dark colours, which their &s;ummer coats are &s;tained with, into a &s;nowy whitene&s;s; whereby they not only are undi&s;coverable at any con&s;iderable di&s;tance, even though lying on the open ground, but al&s;o, if by chance they &s;hould be &s;een, their natural &s;wift|ne&s;s cannot but perfectly avail them in their flight, over large plains, in which, from the re&s;emblance of their own colour with that of the &s;urrounding country, their figure is very quickly as much lo&s;t therein, as a drop of water falling into the va&s;t expan&s;e of ocean.</P>
<P><PB N="391" REF="411">Animals of the &s;erpent, frog, and lizard kind, who&s;e re&s;idence is ever among&s;t gra&s;s, corn, and herbage, have for the mo&s;t part the ba&s;is of their cloathing of a green colour. When they are &s;potted or &s;triped, the generality of tho&s;e marks are either formed with yellow, which is the next mo&s;t uni|ver&s;al colour in nature, e&s;pecially among&s;t the field flowers, or el&s;e with various &s;hades of brown, ap|proaching to the repre&s;entation of earth, and of the roots and barks of trees. By this means they ea|&s;ily elude the &s;ight and &s;earch of the birds and other animals, which would otherwi&s;e de&s;troy them in great quantities, unarmed as they are, and inca|pable of defending them&s;elves when attacked.</P>
<P>The &s;o much admired cameleon, who&s;e food being &s;mall in&s;ects, which are borne about in the &s;ummer air, not the air it&s;elf, as it was formerly imagined, renders it nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould ever remain in places un&s;heltered and open to every view, is endued with a power of a&s;&s;uming the co|lour of whatever he happens to lie upon. But here let us not lead our fair readers into the vulgar error of imagining he is able to change the colour from one to another, any more than in appearance. In &s;hort, what little tinct he really has, which is, indeed very little, is like others of the lizard cla&s;s, greeni&s;h, and con&s;equently not much different from that of the objects among&s;t which he has the mo&s;t frequent nece&s;&s;ity to take up his &s;tation; but be&s;ides this, the great tran&s;parency of his body, through which the colour of whatever he happens to lie upon, is ea&s;ily di&s;cernible, is the greate&s;t &s;ecu|rity he has; and by making it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible
<PB N="392" REF="412">
for him to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, has given ri&s;e to the opinion, that he a&s;&s;umes a colour, which, in reali|ty, he only &s;uffers to be &s;een.</P>
<P>Caterpillars, al&s;o, which are the natural food of many kinds of birds, are for the mo&s;t part found to partake of the colours of tho&s;e plants which they feed on and inhabit. Nay, there is one parti|cular cla&s;s of them, well known to the fly-fancier by the name of Loopers, which fixing them&s;elves to the barks of certain branches of trees, and &s;tretch|ing out their bodies therefrom perfectly &s;trait, and in a certain oblique direction, a&s;&s;ume &s;o exactly in their colour, form, and rugged contexture, the ap|pearance of the natural &s;prigs of tho&s;e branches, that a very di&s;cerning eye may look attentively on a branch where hundreds of them are affixed, and if uninformed of their property, may chance not to di&s;cover one.</P>
<P>There is an in&s;ect, however, very frequent in the We&s;t Indies, which is &s;till more extraordinarily &s;heltered under a feigned appearance. He is of the locu&s;t, or rather of the mantis kind. His body is long, &s;lender, and knobbed; of a brown colour, and therefore bears a very near re&s;emblance to a broken &s;prig of wood: but be&s;ides this, he has two very large and long wings, which are &s;o form|ed both as to &s;hape, colour, and markings, that they exactly repre&s;ent two dried leaves in the fall of autumn, embrowned by the heat of the &s;un, withered up, and curled about the edges; and, from an intire deficiency of all juices and moi&s;ture, every minute&s;t ramification of the fibrous texture, rendered di&s;tinctly vi&s;ible. It is called the Walk|ing
<PB N="393" REF="413">
Leaf, a name that indeed mo&s;t truly expre&s;&s;es its figure, which is &s;o amazingly like an outca&s;t of the &s;ea&s;on, that excepting when he moves, he can never attract the notice of any eye what&s;oever.</P>
<P>This kind of protection from a re&s;emblance to external objects, extends even &s;o far as into the earth and water. Worms, grubs, and other in|&s;ects, who&s;e habitation is under ground, yet are liable to be frequently di&s;turbed by the plough or &s;pade, and brought to the view of their de|&s;troyers, are for the mo&s;t part found to be of a colour nearly re&s;embling the clods of earth among&s;t which they lie le&s;s di&s;cernible than they would be, were they of a red, blue, green, or any other bright colour, which would form a more apparent contra&s;t to the &s;urrounding glebe. Many of the animals who&s;e fir&s;t &s;tate of life is in the waters, and who would therefore be a ready prey to the fi&s;hes who inhabit them, are taught by the univer&s;al mi&s;tre&s;s nature a means of forming to them&s;elves a cru&s;ta|ceous covering, which &s;o nearly re&s;embles the &s;mall &s;prigs, pieces of dead bark, &s;traws, &amp;c. that are every where to be found at the bottom of brooks and rivers, that they lie &s;ecure and unnoticed by tho&s;e animals, who would be tempted by a figure more re&s;embling life, to &s;eize on and devour them. Nay, even the fi&s;h them&s;elves frequently partake &s;o much of the colours of the mo&s;&s;es, herbage, &amp;c. among&s;t which they harbour, that they are not ea&s;ily to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, excepting when in motion.</P>
<P>Such are the means wherewith kind Providence has furni&s;hed different creatures to elude almo&s;t the &s;tricte&s;t &s;earch, and thereby to avoid the being at|tacked.
<PB N="394" REF="414">
Yet, as for the wi&s;e&s;t purpo&s;es, the whole animal kingdom &s;eems in one perpetual &s;tate of warfare within it&s;elf, it was al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that certain means of e&s;cape &s;hould be provided to have recour&s;e to, in ca&s;e the methods of prevention &s;hould prove ineffectual. Of the&s;e, every animal is more or le&s;s in&s;tructed, and endued with powers for relieving it&s;elf, even in the height of the mo&s;t imminent danger, and when almo&s;t in the jaws of its mo&s;t rapacious enemy.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e, &s;ome are by very &s;wift and &s;udden flight; &s;ome by the help of a peculiar &s;pringine&s;s of limbs, which in high, and unexpected leaps, conveys them in&s;tantly out of the reach, or at lea&s;t out of the ken of their adver&s;ary. Others, as the mole, the ferret, the grillotalpa, &amp;c. by an expert rapidity in digging into the bowels of the earth, and at the &s;ame time clo&s;ing up the pa&s;&s;age, thro' which they have forced their way: whil&s;t others, la&s;tly, find means to e&s;cape, by taking refuge in an element, whereinto their adver&s;aries dare not, or cannot follow them, which is the ca&s;e with the whole race of amphibious animals.</P>
<P>Some kinds of creatures there are, e&s;pecially among&s;t the in&s;ect tribe, who, having neither &s;trength to re&s;i&s;t, nor agility to fly, deceive their enemies by a&s;&s;uming the appearance of death. To this &s;tratagem, many of the &s;maller &s;pecies of the beetle, or &s;carabeus cla&s;s, have immediate re&s;ource on the lea&s;t approach of danger, as any one may ea&s;ily be convinced, by touching them with a &s;tick, or taking them into the hand; when they in&s;tantly turn on their backs, contract all their limbs to|gether,

and lie for a time under the appearance of a little inanimate grain, which they do not &s;hake off, till by the &s;tillne&s;s of every thing round them, they are per&s;uaded they can run no risk by rea&s;&s;uming the &s;igns of life; which they do with as much cau|tion and gradual deliberation, as they put on the image of death with pre&s;ence of mind and ready precipitation.</P>
<P>Many other devices of &s;omewhat a &s;imilar na|ture, are made u&s;e of by various creatures, for the purpo&s;es above-mentioned; the minutiae of which it would be too tedious here to enter into. But I think we cannot with any propriety clo&s;e this ar|ticle, without taking notice of two animals, which po&s;&s;e&s;s qualities &s;o eminently &s;ingular for repelling and &s;topping the career of their pur&s;uers, that it is rather more wonderful that they &s;hould ever be taken at all, than that the knowledge of them and their properties &s;hould be &s;o little known, as in general they are.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e that I &s;hall mention, is the calamary, or ink fi&s;h. This animal, who&s;e &s;ingula|rity of figure has induced me to make it the &s;ub|ject of the copper-plate annexed to this number, is found in great abundance on the coa&s;t of the warmer parts of Europe. He is of the polypus cla&s;s, and frequently lies on the &s;urface of the water, with the arms which are repre&s;ented in the figure &s;pread out for the catching of &s;uch fi&s;h as may hap|pen to come in his way, and which by the means of numberle&s;s &s;uckers of a mo&s;t curious mechani&s;m that are arranged along the arms, are not only &s;ecured from e&s;caping him, if once they come within
<PB N="396" REF="417">
his touch, but are al&s;o impoi&s;oned by it in &s;uch a manner, that if they by dint of &s;truggling, &s;hould force them&s;elves from his hold, they would die al|mo&s;t immediately. Thus arm'd, therefore, and provided for attack, he frequently &s;eizes a fi&s;h much larger than him&s;elf, who&s;e juices he &s;ates him&s;elf with, abandoning the remainder to the waves.</P>
<P>There are, however, &s;ome kinds of fi&s;h to whom he in his turn is a proper prey; who&s;e bulk is too much for him to attack, and their activity too great to fly from. For his &s;ecurity then, from the&s;e powerful enemies, he is furni&s;hed with two advantageous properties; the fir&s;t is a very clear and exten&s;ive &s;ight, from a pair of large globular and projecting eyes, which are &s;o placed as to command all objects that can advance from any part round him; the &s;econd, and that which is more imme|diately peculiar to him&s;elf, is a certain black fluid, which on the approach of an enemy he ejects from his body in large quantities, and which muddying the water for a very con&s;iderable &s;pace round him, not only conceals the &s;pot of his immediate re&s;i|dence, but al&s;o deters his antagoni&s;t from pur&s;u|ing him. So careful has nature been for the pre|&s;ervation of every one of her creatures however in|con&s;iderable or apparently u&s;ele&s;s!</P>
<P>The other in&s;tance of providential care, where|with I &s;hall at pre&s;ent clo&s;e this department of phi|lo&s;ophy, is that of the torpedo, or cramp-fi&s;h, a creature which tho' a very &s;low &s;wimmer, and in its con&s;truction dive&s;ted of all means of preventing or avoiding any attack made on it; yet is furni&s;hed
<PB N="397" REF="418">
with a method of rendering &s;uch attacks fruitle&s;s, and, as it were by a &s;troke of magic, reducing its enemy to a &s;tate of inactivity and impotence. In &s;hort, the skin of this animal is formed of a texture &s;o ela&s;tic and powerful, that on the very &s;lighte&s;t touch of it, even with the end of a &s;tick, it numbs and de&s;troys the &s;en&s;e of feeling in the &s;ame manner as a fit of the cramp would do, enervating the whole frame, and producing &s;uch an effect as would, was the fact not &s;o well known, appear incredible. What then mu&s;t be the con&s;equence to any animal who &s;hould eagerly &s;eize on it, with a de&s;ign of making it his prey? What, but a total deprivation of all &s;en&s;e, for at lea&s;t time &s;ufficient to enable the de&s;tined victim to make his e&s;cape, and &s;ave him&s;elf from the threatening jaws of de&s;truction!</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome few, among numberle&s;s in&s;tances, of the infinite wi&s;dom of the great fir&s;t cau&s;e in his works of creation, who has thus contrived it &s;o, that although it is nece&s;&s;ary the different &s;pecies of animals &s;hould mutually prey on one another, and that each &s;hould find him&s;elf &s;urrounded with a ho&s;t of profe&s;&s;ed as well as in&s;idious enemies, yet that every kind &s;hould be &s;upplied, and that with a variety of invention which nothing le&s;s than infinite wi&s;dom could form, with the me|thods for preventing its race from utter extirpa|tion, and pre&s;erving the ju&s;t and proper balance which the u&s;e and the conveniency of man, and often &s;ome hidden cau&s;e beyond the comprehen|&s;ion of his under&s;tanding, require to be maintained among&s;t the greater and the &s;maller wheels of this great machine the univer&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>THE LADY's GEOGRAPHY CONTINUED.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the MANNERS and CUSTOMS of the Inhabi|tants of AMBOYNA.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER having given &s;ome account of the habits, arms, and fe&s;tivals of the&s;e people, it will be proper to give a &s;light de&s;cription of tho&s;e diver&s;ions wherewith the fea&s;ts we have men|tioned con&s;tantly conclude, which are tho&s;e of mu&s;ic, &s;inging, and dancing.</P>
<P>Of their in&s;truments of mu&s;ic, the principal one is the <HI>Gongue:</HI> this is of very great u&s;e through|out the Indies, but is mo&s;t highly e&s;teemed by the Amboynians, who ever pre&s;erve it among&s;t their mo&s;t valuable effects. Of the&s;e there are two &s;orts, the one large, the other &s;mall. Of the latter &s;ort, they arrange &s;ix or &s;even in a row on a bench, which are &s;truck alternately with two &s;ticks cover|ed over with linen cloth. This in&s;trument, which they call <HI>Tataboang,</HI> &s;erves by way of accompany|ment to the former, but is played much quicker, though ever in cadence therewith.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fifa</HI> keeps the &s;ame time as the larger <HI>Gongue,</HI> and is properly a drum. It is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the <HI>Rabana</HI> by being of a cylindrical figure,

whereas the other is flat. Be&s;ides which, the man|ner of touching them is different. There is al&s;o a third &s;ort, which re&s;embles a little barrel, &s;lung by a &s;tring round the neck, and is covered with parch|ment at both ends, whereas the others are only covered at top. The figure of the&s;e in&s;truments together, with the manner of u&s;ing them may be &s;een in a plate, annexed to Numb. III. of this work.</P>
<P>Their dances keep time to the &s;ound of the&s;e in|&s;truments, with an exactne&s;s, and a degree of agi|lity, that is really &s;urpri&s;ing. Their prodigious leaps, their &s;upple turns, and the extraordinary windings and changes of po&s;ture, which they bring their joints to execute, &s;urpa&s;s all de&s;cription or idea. As &s;oon as the fea&s;t is over, a man appears dre&s;t in the manner of the <HI>Alfourians</HI> or moun|taineers, covered with the branches and leaves of trees, and armed with a large buckler, a &s;abre or javelin, and a helmet, &s;urmounted with a large plume of feathers of the bird of paradi&s;e. In this &s;ingular equipage, he cries out, for &s;ome mo|ments in the air, &s;ometimes alone, and &s;ometimes accompanied by a &s;econd of the &s;ame cla&s;s, ca&s;t|ing around him looks of the utmo&s;t fury and per|turbation, and making the mo&s;t terrible efforts, as if he would beat down the whole world under his blows.</P>
<P>This exerci&s;e, which they expre&s;s by the word <HI>T&s;jakali,</HI> is con&s;tantly &s;ucceeded by their common dances, which each &s;ex &s;everally executes by two or four together, with great gracefulne&s;s and addre&s;s: &s;ome holding a naked poignard in each hand, and
<PB N="400" REF="422">
&s;ometimes one or two &s;ilk handkerchiefs, which they wave around them; others have a fine &s;carf or &s;a&s;h of the &s;ame, or of chintz, which is fa&s;tened to the left &s;houlder, and one end of which trails on the ground. The men wear be&s;ides a turban on the head; and the women decorate their hair with flowers. Their dancers are always young un|married people: when they begin, and when they retire, they &s;alute the company by joining their hands over their heads: but on the&s;e occa&s;ions it is the cu&s;tom always to make them a pre&s;ent of certain habits of &s;ilk, or &s;ome rich &s;tuff, in which &s;ome one of the &s;pectators runs to enwrap their bodies, whil&s;t they are yet dancing, by the way of intreating them as it were not to fatigue them&s;elves any longer; and this is one of the ex|pences by which the Amboynians ruin them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>The men as well as the women u&s;ually accom|pany the&s;e dances with their voices. The&s;e &s;ongs, which &s;erve as a kind of annals, for want of better hi&s;torians, contain, among other things, the ancient events of their country; the prai&s;es of their heroes; and the glorious deeds of their ance&s;tors. And this vocal and in&s;trumental mu&s;ic is not only made u&s;e of in their great fea&s;ts, and on other particular occa&s;ions, but al&s;o on board their boats and barges, in which the rowers keep the mo&s;t perfect time to the in&s;truments and voices.</P>
