<HEAD>THE Shepherd of Sali&s;bury Plain.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PART II.</HEAD>
<P>I AM willing to hope that my read|ers will not be &s;orry to hear &s;ome farther particulars of their old acquaint|ance <HI>the Shepherd of Sali&s;bury Plain.</HI> They will call to mind that at the end of the fir&s;t part, he was returning home full of gratitude for the favours he had received from Mr. John&s;on, whom we left pur&s;uing his journey, after having promi&s;ed to make a vi&s;it to the Shepherd's Cottage.</P>
<P>Mr. John&s;on after having pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time with his friend, &s;at out on his return to Sali&s;bury, and on the Saturday evening reached a very &s;mall
<PB N="4" REF="3">inn, a mile or two di&s;tant from the Shepherd's Village; for he never tra|velled on a Sunday. He went the next morning to the Church neare&s;t the hou&s;e, where he had pa&s;&s;ed the night; and after taking &s;uch refre&s;h|ment as he could get at that hou&s;e, he walked on to find out the Shepherd's cottage. His rea&s;on for vi&s;iting him on a Sunday was chiefly, becau&s;e he &s;uppo&s;ed it to be the only day which the Shepherd's employment allowed him to pa&s;s at home with his family, and as Mr. John&s;on had been &s;truck with his talk, he thought it would be neither unplea&s;ant nor unprofitable to ob&s;erve how a Man who carried &s;uch an appearance of piety &s;pent his Sun|day; for though he was &s;o low in the world, this Gentleman was not above entering very clo&s;ely into his charac|ter, of which he thought he &s;hould be able to form a better judgment, by &s;eeing whether his practice at home kept pace with his profe&s;&s;ions abroad. For it is not &s;o much by ob&s;erving how people talk, as how they live,
<PB N="5" REF="4">that we ought to judge of their cha|racters.</P>
<P>After a plea&s;ant walk Mr. John|&s;on got within &s;ight of the cottage, to which he was directed by the clump of hawthorns and the broken chim|ney. He wi&s;hed to take the family by &s;urpri&s;e; and walking gently up to the hou&s;e he &s;tood awhile to li&s;ten. The door being half open, he &s;aw the Shepherd (who looked &s;o re|&s;pectable in his Sunday Coat that he &s;hould hardly have known him) his Wife, and their numerous young fami|ly, drawing round their little table, which was covered with a clean though very coar&s;e cloth. There &s;tood on it a large di&s;h of potatoes, a brown pitch|er, and a piece of coar&s;e loaf. The wife and children &s;tood in &s;ilent at|tention, while the Shepherd, with up|lifted hands and eyes, devoutly beg|ged the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven on their hornely fare. Mr. John&s;on could not help &s;ighing to re&s;lect, that he had &s;ome|times
<PB N="6" REF="5">&s;een better dinners eaten with le&s;s appearance of thankfulne&s;s</P>
<P>The Shepherd and his wife then &s;at down with great &s;eeming cheerfulne&s;s, but the children &s;tood; and while the mother was helping them, little fre&s;h-coloured Molly who had picked the wool from the bu&s;hes with &s;o much de|light, cried out, "Father, I wi&s;h I was big enough to &s;ay grace, I am &s;ure I &s;hould &s;ay it very heartily to|day, for I was thinking what mu&s;t <HI>poor</HI> people do who have no &s;alt to their po|tatoes, and do but look our di&s;h is quine full."&mdash;"this is the true way of thinking, Molly," &s;aid the Father, "in whatever concerns bodily wants, and bodily comforts, it is our duty to com|pare our own lot with the lot of tho&s;e who are wor&s;e off, and this will keep us thankful. On the other hand, whenever we are tempted to &s;et up our own wi&s;dom or goodne&s;s, we mu&s;t compare our&s;elves with tho&s;e who are wi&s;er and better, and that will keep us humble." Molly was now &s;o hungry, and found the potatoes &s;o good, that &s;he had no time to make
<PB N="7" REF="6">any more remarks; but was devour|ing her dinner very heartily; when the barking of the great dog drew her attention from her trencher to the door, and &s;pying the &s;tranger, &s;he cried out, "Look father, &s;ee here, if yonder is not the good Gentleman!" Mr. John|&s;on finding him&s;elf di&s;covered, imme|diately walived in, and was heartily welcomed by the hone&s;t Shepherd, who told his wi&s;e that this was the Gentle|man to whom they were &s;o much obliged.</P>
<P>The good Woman began, as &s;ome very neat people are rather too apt to do, with making many apologies that her hou&s;e was not cleaner, and that things were not in fitter order to re|ceive &s;uch a Gentleman. Mr. John|&s;on however, on looking round, could di&s;cover nothing but the mo&s;t perfect neatne&s;s. The trenchers on which they were eating were almo&s;t as white as their linen; and notwith&s;tanding the number and &s;mallne&s;s of the child|ren, there was not the lea&s;t appearance
<PB N="8" REF="7">of dart or inter. The furniture was very &s;imple and poor, hardly indeed amounting to bare nece&s;&s;aries. It con|&s;i&s;ted of four brown wooden chairs, which, by con&s;tant rubbing, were be|come as bright as a looking gla&s;s; an iron pot and kettle; a poor old grate which &s;carcely held a handful of coals, and our of which the little fire that had been in it appeared to have been taken, as &s;oon as it had an&s;wered the end for which it had been lighted, that of boiling their potatoes. Over the chimney &s;tood an old fa&s;h|ioned broad bright candle&s;tick, and a &s;till brighter &s;pit; it was pretty clear that this la&s;t was kept rather for orna|ment than u&s;e. An old carved elbow chair, and a che&s;t of the &s;ame date which &s;tood in the corner, were con&s;i|dered as the mo&s;t valuable part of the Shepherd's goods, having been in his family for three generations. But all the&s;e were lightly e&s;teemed by him, in compari&s;on of another po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which added to the above made up the whole of what he had inherited from
<PB N="9" REF="8">his father; and which la&s;t he would not have parted with, if no other could have been had, for a king's ran&s;om: this was a large old Bible, which lay on the window &s;eat, neatly covered with brown cloth, variou&s;ly patched. This &s;acred book was mo&s;t reverendly pre&s;erved from dog's ears, dirt, and every other injury, but &s;uch as time and much u&s;e had made it &s;uffer in &s;pite of care. On the clean white walls were pa&s;ted a hymn on the Crucifixion of our Saviour, a print of the Prodigal Son, the Shepherd's Hymn, and a <HI>New Hi&s;tory of a True Book.</HI></P>
<P>After the fir&s;t &s;alutations were over, Mr. John&s;on &s;aid, that if they would go on quietly with their dinner he would &s;it down. Though a good deal a&s;hamed, they thought it more re&s;pect|ful to obey the Gentleman, who hav|ing ca&s;t his eye on their &s;lender pro|vi&s;ions, gently rebuked the Shepherd for not having indulged him&s;elf, as it was Sunday, with a mor&s;el of Bacon to reli&s;h his Potatoes. The Shepherd
<PB N="10" REF="9">&s;aid nothing, but poor Mary coloured, and hung down her head, &s;aying, "in|deed, Sir, it is not my fault, I did beg my hu&s;band to allow him&s;elf a bit of meat to-day out of your honour's bounty; but he was too good to do it, and it is all for my &s;ake." The Shepherd &s;eemed unwilling to come to an explanation, but Mr. John&s;on de|&s;ired Mary to go on. So &s;he continu|ed, "you mu&s;t know, Sir, that both of us next to a &s;in, dread a debt, and indeed in &s;ome ca&s;es a debt is a &s;in; but with all our care and pains we have never been able quite to pay off the Doctor's bill, for that bad fit of the Rheumati&s;m which I had la&s;t winter. Now when you were plea&s;ed to give my hu&s;band that kind pre&s;ent the other day, I heartily de&s;ired him to buy a bit of meat for Sunday, as I &s;aid be|fore, that he might have a little refre&s;h|ment for him&s;elf out of your kindne&s;s. But an&s;wered he, Mary, it is never out of my mind long together that we &s;till owe a few &s;hillings to the Doctor, (and thank God it is all we did
<PB N="11" REF="10">owe in the world.) Now if I carry him this money directly it will not only &s;hew him our hone&s;ty and our good will, but it will be an encouragement to him to come to you another time in ca&s;e you &s;hould be taken once more in &s;uch a bad fit; for I mu&s;t own, add|ed my poor hu&s;band, that the thought of your being &s;o terribly ill without any help, is the only misfortune that I want courage to face."</P>
<P>Here the grateful womans tears ran down &s;o fa&s;t that &s;he could not go on. She wiped them with the corner of her apron, and humbly begged pardon for making &s;o free. "Indeed, Sir," &s;aid the Shepherd, "though my wife is full as unwilling to be in debt as my|&s;elf, yet I could hardly prevail on her to con&s;ent to my paying this money ju&s;t then, becau&s;e &s;he &s;aid it was hard I &s;hould not have a ta&s;te of the Gen|tleman's bounty my&s;elf. But for once, Sir, I would have my own way. For you mu&s;t know, as I pa&s;s be&s;t part of my time alone, tending my &s;heep, 'tis
<PB N="12" REF="11">a great point with me, Sir, to get com|fortable matter for my own thoughts; &s;o that 'tis rather &s;elf intere&s;t in me to allow my&s;elf in no plea&s;ures and no practices that won't bear thinking on over and over. For when one is a good deal alone you know, Sir, all one's bad deeds do &s;o ru&s;h in upon one, as I may &s;ay, and &s;o torment one, that there is no true comfort to be had but in keep|ing clear of wrong doings, and fal&s;e plea&s;ures; and that I &s;uppo&s;e may be one rea&s;on why &s;o many folks hate to &s;tay a bit by them&s;elves.&mdash;But as I was &s;aying&mdash;when I came to think the mat|ter over on the hill yonder, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, a good dinner is a good thing I grant, and yet it will be but cold comfort to me a week after, to be able to &s;ay&mdash;to be &s;ure I had a nice &s;houlder of mutton la&s;t Sunday for dinner, thanks to the good Gentleman, but then I am in debt.&mdash;I <HI>had</HI> a rare dinner, that's certain, but the plea&s;ure of that has long been over, and the debt &s;till remains. I have &s;pent the crown, and now if my poor wife &s;hould be taken
<PB N="13" REF="12">in one of tho&s;e fits again, die &s;he mu&s;t, unle&s;s God work a miracle to prevent it, for I can get no help for her. This thought &s;ettled all; and I &s;et off di|rectly and paid the crown to the Doc|tor with as much cheerfulne&s;s as I &s;hould have felt on &s;itting down to the fatte&s;t &s;houlder of mutton that ever was roa&s;ted. And if I was contented at the time, think how much more happy I have been at the remembrance! O Sir, there are no plea&s;ures worth the name but &s;uch as bring no plague or penitence after them."</P>
<P>Mr. John&s;on was &s;atisfied with the Shepherd's rea&s;ons; and agreed, that though a good dinner was not to be de&s;pi&s;ed, yet it was not worthy to be compared with <HI>a contented Mind, which</HI> (as the Bible truly &s;ays) <HI>is a continual fea&s;t.</HI> "But come," &s;aid the good Gen|tleman, "what have we got in this brown mug?" "As good water," &s;aid the Shepherd, "as any in the king's domini|ons. I have heard of countries beyond &s;ea in which there is no whole&s;ome
<PB N="14" REF="13">water; nay, I have been my&s;elf in a great town not far off where they are obliged to buy all the water they get, while a good Providence &s;ends to my very door a &s;pring as clear and fine as Jacob's well. When I am tempt|ed to repine that I have often no other drink, I call to mind, that it was nothing better than a cup of cold water which the woman of Samaria drew for the greate&s;t gue&s;t that ever vi&s;ited this world."</P>
<P>"Very well," replied Mr. John&s;on; "but as your hone&s;ty has made you prefer a poor meal to being in debt, I will at lea&s;t &s;end and get &s;omething for you to drink. I &s;aw a little public-hou&s;e ju&s;t by the church, as I came along. Let that little ro&s;y-faced fellow fetch a mug of beer."</P>
<P>So &s;aying, he looked full at the Boy who did not offer to &s;tir; but ca&s;t an eye at his father to know what he was to do. "Sir," &s;aid the Shepherd, "I hope we &s;hall not ap|pear ungrateful, if we &s;eem to re|fu&s;e
<PB N="15" REF="14">your favour; my little boy would, I am &s;ure, fly to &s;erve you on any o|ther occa&s;ion. But, good Sir, it is Sunday, and &s;hould any of my fami|ly be &s;een at a Public-hou&s;e on a Sab|bath-day, it would be a much greater grief to me than to drink water all my life. I am often talking again&s;t the&s;e doings to others, and if I &s;hould &s;ay one thing and do another, you can't think what an advantage it would give many of my neighbours over me, who would be glad enough to report that they caught the Shepherd's Son at the Ale-hou&s;e, without explaining how it happened. Chri&s;tians, you know, Sir, mu&s;t be doubly watchful, or they will not only bring di&s;grace on them|&s;elves, but what is much wor&s;e, on that holy name by which they are called."</P>
<P>"Are you not a little too cautious, my hone&s;t friend?" &s;aid Mr. John&s;on. "I humbly a&s;k your pardon, Sir," replied the Shepherd, "if I think that is impo&s;&s;ible. In my poor no|tion
<PB N="16" REF="15">I no more under&s;tand how a man can be too cautious, than how he can be too &s;trong, or too healthy."</P>
<P>"You are right indeed," &s;aid Mr. John&s;on, "as a general principle, but this &s;truck me as a very &s;mall thing." "Sir," &s;aid the Shepherd, "I am afraid you will think me very bold, but you encourage me to &s;peak out."&mdash;"'Tis what I wi&s;h," &s;aid the Gentleman.&mdash; "Then, Sir," re&s;umed the Shepherd, "I doubt, if where there is a temptation to do wrong any thing can be called &s;mall; that is, in &s;hort, if there is any &s;uch thing as a &s;mall wilful &s;in. A poor man like me is &s;eldom called out to do great things, &s;o that it is not by a few great deeds his character can be judged by his neighbours, but by the little round of daily cu&s;toms he allows him&s;elf in."&mdash;While they were thus talking, the children who had &s;tood very quietly behind, and had not &s;tirred a foot, now began to &s;camper about all at once, and in a moment ran
<PB N="17" REF="16">to the window-&s;eat to pick up their
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> 
little old hats. Mr. John&s;on look|ed &s;urpri&s;ed at this di&s;turbance; the Shepherd a&s;ked his pardon, telling him it was the &s;ound of the Church Bell which had been the cau&s;e of their rude|ne&s;s; for their Mother had brought them up with &s;uch a fear of being too late for Church, that it was but who
<PB N="18" REF="17">could catch the fir&s;t &s;troke of the bell, and be fir&s;t ready. He had al|ways taught them to think that no|thing was more indecent than to get into Church after it was begun; for as the &s;ervice opened with an exhorta|tion to repentance, and a confe&s;&s;ion of &s;in, it looked very pre&s;umptuous not to be ready to join in it; it looked as if people did not feel them&s;elves to be &s;inners. And though &s;uch as lived at a great di&s;tance might plead difference of clocks as an excu&s;e, yet tho&s;e who lived within the &s;ound of the bell, could pretend neither ignorance nor mi&s;take.</P>
<P>Mary and her children &s;et forward. Mr. John&s;on and the Shepherd follow|ed, taking care to talk the whole way on &s;uch &s;ubjects as might fit them for the &s;olemn duties of the place to which they were going. "I have often been &s;orry to ob&s;erve," &s;aid Mr. John&s;on, "that many who are reckoned de|cent, good kind of people, and who would on no account neglect going
<PB N="19" REF="18">to church, yet &s;eem to care but little in what frame or temper of mind they go thither. They will talk of their worldly concerns till they get within the door, and then take them up again the very minute the &s;ermon is over, which makes me ready to fear they lay too much &s;tre&s;s on the mere form of going to a place of wor&s;hip. Now, for my part, I always find that it re|quires a little time to bring my mind into a &s;tate fit to do any <HI>common</HI> bu&s;i|ne&s;s well, much more this great and mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s of all." "Yes, Sir," &s;aid the Shepherd, "and then I think too how bu&s;y I &s;hould be in preparing my mind, if I was going into the pre&s;ence of a great gentleman, or a Lord, or the King; and &s;hall the King of Kings be treated with le&s;s re&s;pect? Be&s;ides, one likes to &s;ee peo|ple feel as if going to Church was a thing of choice and plea&s;ure, as well as a duty, and that they were as de|&s;irous not be the la&s;t there, as they would be if they were going to a fea&s;t or a fair."</P>
<PB N="20" REF="19">
<P>After &s;ervice, Mr. Jenkins the Cler|gyman, who was well acquainted with the character of Mr. John&s;on, and had a great re&s;pect for him, acco&s;ted him with much civility; expre&s;&s;ing his con|cern that he could not enjoy ju&s;t now &s;o much of his conver&s;ation as he wi&s;hed, as he was obliged to vi&s;it a &s;ick per&s;on at a di&s;tance, but hoped to have a little talk with him before he left the Village. As they walked along toge|ther, Mr. John&s;on made &s;uch inquiries about the Shepherd, as &s;erved to con|firm him in the high opinion he enter|tained of his piety, good-&s;en&s;e, indu&s;|try, and &s;elf-denial. They parted, the Clergyman promi&s;ing to call in at the Cottage in his way home.</P>
<P>The Shepherd, who took it for grant|ed that Mr. John&s;on was gone to the Par&s;onage, walked home with his wife and children, and was beginning in his u&s;ual way to catechi&s;e and in&s;truct his family, when Mr. John&s;on came in, and in&s;i&s;ted that the Shepherd &s;hould go on with his in&s;tructions, ju&s;t as if
<PB N="21" REF="20">he were not there. This Gentleman who was very de&s;irous of being u&s;eful to his own Servants and workmen in the way of religious in&s;truction, was &s;ome|times &s;orry to find that though he took a good deal of pains, they did not now and then quite under&s;tand him, for though his meaning was very good, he language was not always very plain; and though the <HI>things</HI> he &s;aid were not hard to be under&s;tood, yet the <HI>words</HI> were, e&s;pecially to &s;uch as were very ignorant. And he now began to find out, that if people were ever &s;o wi&s;e and good, yet if they had not a &s;imple, agreeable, and familiar way of expre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves, &s;ome of their plain hearers would not be much the better for them. For this rea&s;on he was not above li&s;tening to the plain, humble way in which this hone&s;t man taught his family, for though he knew that he him&s;elf had many advantages over the Shepherd, had more learning, and could teach him many things, yet he was not too proud to learn even of &s;o poor a Man, in any point where
<PB N="22" REF="21">he thought the Shepherd might have the advantage of him.</P>
<P>This Gentleman was much plea&s;ed with the knowledge and piety he di&s;|covered in the an&s;wers of the chil|dren; and de&s;ired the Shepherd to tell him how he contrived to keep up a &s;en&s;e of divine things in his own mind and in that of his family with &s;o little lei&s;ure and &s;o little reading. "O as to that, Sir," &s;aid the Shepherd, "we do not read much except in one book to be &s;ure; but by hearty prayer for God's ble&s;&s;ing on the u&s;e of that book, what little knowledge is needful &s;eems to come of cour&s;e, as it were. And my chief &s;tudy has been to bring the fruits of the Sunday reading into the week's bu&s;ine&s;s, and to keep up the &s;ame &s;en&s;e of GOD in the heart, when the Bible is in the cupboard as when it is in the hand. In &s;hort, to apply what I read in the book, to what I meet with in the Field."</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="22">
"I don't quite under&s;tand you," &s;aid Mr. John&s;on. "Sir," replied the Shepherd, "I have but a poor gift at conveying the&s;e things to others, though I have much comfort from them in my own mind; but I am &s;ure that the mo&s;t ignorant and hard working peo|ple, who are in earne&s;t about their &s;alvation, may help to keep up devout thoughts and good affections during the week, though they have hardly any time to look at a book.&mdash;And it will help them to keep out bad thoughts too, which is no &s;mall mat|ter. But then they mu&s;t know the Bible; they mu&s;t have read the word of God; that is a kind of &s;tock in trade for a Chri&s;tian to &s;et up with; and it is this which makes me &s;o di|ligent in teaching it to my children; and even in &s;toring their memories with P&s;alms and Chapters. This is a great help to a poor hard-working Man, who will hardly meet with any thing but what he may turn to &s;ome good account. If one lives in the fear and the love of GOD, almo&s;t every
<PB N="24" REF="23">thing one &s;ees abroad will teach one to adore his power and goodne&s;s, and bring to mind &s;ome texts of Scripture, which &s;hall fill the heart with thank|fulne&s;s, and the mouth with prai&s;e. When I look upwards <HI>the Heavens declare the glory of God;</HI> and &s;hall I be &s;ilent and ungrateful? if I look round and &s;ee the Vallies &s;tanding thick with Corn, how can I help ble&s;&s;ing that Power, who <HI>giveth me all things richly to enjoy?</HI> I may learn gratitude from the bea&s;ts of the Field, for the <HI>Ox knoweth his Owner, and the A&s;s his Ma&s;ter's Crib,</HI> and &s;hall a Chri&s;|tian not know, and &s;hall a Chri&s;tian not con&s;ider, what great things GOD has done for him? I, who am a Shepherd, endeavour to fill my &s;oul with a con|&s;tant remembrance of that good Shep|herd, who <HI>feedeth me in green pa&s;tures, and maketh me to lie down be&s;ide the &s;till waters, and who&s;e rod and &s;taff comfort me."</HI></P>
<P>"You are happy," &s;aid Mr. John|&s;on, "in this retired life by which
<PB N="25" REF="24">you e&s;cape the corruptions of the world" "Sir," "&s;aid the Shepherd, "I do not e&s;cape the corruptions of my own evil nature. Even there on that wild &s;olitary hill, I can find out that my heart is prone to evil thoughts. I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, that different &s;tates have different temptations. You great folks that live in the world, perhaps are expo&s;ed to &s;ome, of which &s;uch a poor man as I am, know nothing. But to one who leads a lonely life like me, evil thoughts are a chief be&s;etting Sin; and I can no more with&s;tand the&s;e without the grace of God, than a rich Gentleman can with&s;tand the &s;nares of evil company, without the &s;ame grace. And I feel that I &s;tand in need of God's help continually, and if he &s;hould give me up to my own evil heart I &s;hould be lo&s;t,"</P>
<P>Mr. John&s;on approved of the Shep|herd's &s;incerity, for he had always ob|&s;erved that where there was no humi|lity, and no watchfulne&s;s again&s;t Sin, there was no religion, and he &s;aid that
<PB N="26" REF="25">the Man who did not feel him&s;elf to be a &s;inner in his opinion, could not be a chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as they were in this part of their di&s;cour&s;e, Mr. Jenkins, the Clergyman came in. After the u&s;ual &s;alutations, he &s;aid, "Well Shepherd, I wi&s;h you joy; I know you will be &s;orry to gain any advantage by the death of a neigh|bour; but old Wil&s;on my Clerk, was &s;o infirm, and I tru&s;t &s;o well prepared, that there is no rea&s;on to be &s;orry for his death. I have been to pray by him, but he died while I &s;taid. I have always intended you &s;hould &s;uc|ceed to his place; 'tis no great matter, but every little is &s;omething."</P>
<P>"No great matter, Sir," "cried the Shepherd, "indeed it is a great thing to me; it will more than pay my rent. Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD for all his good|ne&s;s." Mary &s;aid nothing, but lifted up her eyes full of tears in &s;ilent gra|titude.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="26">
"I am glad of this little circum|&s;tance," &s;aid Mr. Jenkins, "not only for your &s;ake, but for the &s;ake of the office it&s;elf. I &s;o heartily reverence every religious in&s;titution, that I would never have even the <HI>Amen</HI> added to the ex|cellent prayers of our Church, by vain or profane lips, and if it depended on me, there &s;hould be no &s;uch thing in the land as an idle, drunken, or irre|ligious. Pari&s;h Clerk. Sorry I am to &s;ay, that this matter is not always &s;uf|ficiently attended to, and that I know &s;ome of a very indifferent cha|racter."</P>
<P>Mr. John&s;on now inquired of the Clergyman whether there were many children in the Pari&s;h. "More than you would expect," replied he, "from the &s;eeming &s;mallne&s;s of it, but there are &s;ome little Hamlets which you do not &s;ee." "I think," returned Mr. John&s;on, "I recollect that in the con|ver&s;ation I had with the Shepherd on the hill yonder, he told me you had no Sunday School." "I am &s;orry to
<PB N="28" REF="27">&s;ay we have none," &s;aid the Mini&s;ter; "do what I can to remedy this mis|fortune by public catechi&s;ing; but having two or three Churches to &s;erve, I cannot give &s;o much time as I wi&s;h to private in&s;truction; and having a large family of my own, and no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from others, I have never been able to e&s;tabli&s;h a School."</P>
<P>"There is an excellent in&s;titution in London," &s;aid Mr. John&s;on, "called the Sunday-School Society, which kindly gives books and other helps, on the application of &s;uch pious Mini&s;|ters as &s;tand in need of their aid, and which I am &s;ure would have a&s;&s;i&s;ted you, but I think we &s;hall be able to do &s;omething our&s;elves.&mdash;Shepherd," con|tinued he, "if I was a King, and had it in my power to make you a rich and a great Man, with a word &s;peaking, I would not do it. Tho&s;e who are rai&s;ed by &s;ome &s;udden &s;troke, much above the &s;tation in which divine Providence had placed them, &s;eldom turn out very good, or very happy. I have never
<PB N="29" REF="28">had any great things in my power, but as far as I have been able, I have been always glad to a&s;&s;i&s;t the worthy. I have however never attempted or de&s;ired to &s;et any poor Man much above his natural condition, but it is a plea&s;ure to me to lend him &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance as may make that condition more ea&s;y to him&s;elf, and to put him in a way which &s;hall call him to the performance of more duties than perhaps he could have performed without my help, and of performing them in a better man|ner.&mdash;What Rent do you pay for this Cottage?"</P>
<P>"Fifty Shillings a Year, Sir."</P>
<P>"It is in a &s;ad tattered condition, is there not a better to be had in the Village?"</P>
<P>"That in which the poor Clerk lived," &s;aid the Clergyman, "is not only more tight and whole, but has two decent chambers, and a very large
<PB N="30" REF="29">light kitchen."&mdash;"That will be ve|ry convenient," replied Mr. John&s;on, "pray what is the Rent?" "I think," &s;aid the Shepherd, "poor neighbour Wil&s;on gave &s;omewhat about four pounds a year, or it might be gui|neas."&mdash;"Very well," &s;aid Mr. John|&s;on, "and what will the Clerk's place be worth, think you?" "About three pounds," was the an&s;wer.</P>
<P>"Now," continued Mr. John&s;on, "my plan is, that the Shepherd &s;hould take that hou&s;e immediately; for as the poor Man is dead, there will be no need of waiting till quarter day, if I make up the difference." "True, Sir," &s;aid Mr. Jenkins, "and I am &s;ure my Wife's Father, whom I expect to-morrow, will willingly a&s;&s;i&s;t a little towards buying &s;ome of the Clerk's old goods. And the &s;ooner they re|move the better, for poor Mary caught that bad rheumati&s;m by &s;leeping under a leaky thatch." The Shepherd was too much moved to &s;peak, and Mary could hardly &s;ob out, "Oh! Sir, you
<PB N="31" REF="30">are too good, indeed this hou&s;e will do very well." "It may do very well for you and your children Mary," &s;aid Mr. John&s;on, gravely, "but it will not do for a School; the kitchen is neither large nor light enough. Shep|herd," continued he, "with your good Mini&s;ter's leave, and kind a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I propo&s;e to &s;et up in this pari&s;h a Sun|day School, and to make you the Ma&s;|ter. It will not at all interfere with your weekly calling, and it is the only lawful way in which you could turn the Sabbath into a day of &s;ome little profit to your family, by doing, as I hope, a great deal of good to the Souls of others. The re&s;t of the week you will work as u&s;ual. The difference of rent between this hou&s;e and the Clerk's I &s;hall pay my&s;elf, for to put you into a better hou&s;e at your own expence would be no great act of kindne&s;s.&mdash;As for hone&s;t Mary, who is not fit for hard labour, or any out-of-door work, I propo&s;e to endow a &s;mall weekly &s;chool of which &s;he &s;hall be the Mi&s;|tre&s;s, and employ her notable turn to
<PB N="32" REF="31">good account, by teaching ten or a dozen girls to knit, &s;ew, &s;pin, card, or any other u&s;eful way of getting their bread; for all this I &s;hall only pay her the u&s;ual price, for I am not going to make you rich but u&s;eful."</P>
<P>"Not rich, Sir?" cried the Shep|herd. "How can I ever be thank|ful enough for &s;uch ble&s;&s;ings? And will my poor Mary have a dry thatch over he had? and &s;hall I be able to &s;end for the Doctor when I am like to lo&s;e her? Indeed my cup runs over with ble&s;&s;ings, I hope God will give me humility." Here he and Mary looked at each other and bur&s;t into tears. The Gentleman &s;aw their di&s;|tre&s;s, and kindly walked out upon the little green before the door, that the&s;e hone&s;t people might give vent to their feelings. As &s;oon as they were alone they crept into one corner of the room, where they thought they could not be &s;een, and fell on their knees, de|voutly ble&s;&s;ing and prai&s;ing GOD for his mercies. Never were heartier
<PB N="33" REF="32">prayers pre&s;ented, than this grateful couple offered up for their benefac|tors. The warmth of their gratitude could only be equalled by the earne&s;t|ne&s;s with which they be&s;ought the ble&s;s|ing of GOD on the work in which they were going to engage.</P>
<P>The two Gentlemen now left this happy family, and walked to the Par|&s;onage, where the evening was &s;pent in a manner very edifying to Mr. John|&s;on, who the next day took all pro|per mea&s;ures for putting the Shepherd in immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his now com|fortable habitation. Mr. Jenkins's fa|ther-in-law, the worthy Gentleman who gave the Shepherd's Wife the blank|ets, in the fir&s;t part of this hi&s;tory, ar|rived at the Par&s;onage before Mr. John&s;on left it, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in fitting up the Clerk's Cottage.</P>
<P>Mr. John&s;on took his leave, pro|mi&s;ing to call on the worthy Mini&s;ter and his new Clerk once a year, in his Summer's journey over the Plain, as
<PB N="34" REF="33">long as it &s;hould plea&s;e GOD to &s;pare his life.&mdash;We hope he will never fail to give us an account of the&s;e vi&s;its which we &s;hall be glad to lay before our readers, if they &s;hould contain in|&s;truction or amu&s;ement.</P>
