<P>THE very favourite Song of, "How &s;tands the gla&s;s around, my boys?" is &s;o pecu|liarly adapted to the &s;ituation in which it is in|troduced, that the Author hopes he will not be cen&s;ured for the &s;acrifice he has made of origi|nality in adopting it. It is moreover written in a &s;pirit and ta&s;te which is much ea&s;ier to admire than equal. As to the re&s;t of the &s;ongs, they are all his own; and he fears he mu&s;t tru&s;t more to the indulgence of the public in regard to them, than to any thing he can &s;ay, or has written in their favour.</P>
