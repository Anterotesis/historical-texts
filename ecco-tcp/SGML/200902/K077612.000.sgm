<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>INquiries into antiquity are &s;o little the ta&s;te of the pre&s;ent age, that a writer who employs his time in that way deceives him&s;elf if he expects to derive either much reputation or any advantage from his work. Pre|judiced again&s;t the &s;ubject, we add contempt to its natural &s;teri|lity, and &s;eem to wi&s;h for no in|formation from a province which we have been taught to a&s;&s;ign to fiction and romance. Under the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions the Author of the Introduction wrote. With|out any of the ordinary incite|ments to literary labour, he was induced to proceed by the &s;ole motive of private amu&s;ement.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">
Notwith&s;tanding the &s;mall hopes he entertains of reconciling the public judgment to the pe|riod which he has endeavoured to illu&s;trate, he has taken &s;ome pains to pre&s;ent, in its mo&s;t a|greeable form, a &s;ubject not very capable of ornament. He has &s;tudied to be clear in di&s;qui&s;ition, conci&s;e in ob&s;ervation, ju&s;t in in|ference. An enemy to fiction him&s;elf, he impo&s;es none upon the world. He advances nothing as fact without authorities; and his conjectures ari&s;e not &s;o much from his own ingenuity, as from the proofs which the ancients have laid down before him.</P>
<P>The darkne&s;s, with which the prejudice and vanity of the Scots and Iri&s;h have covered their ori|gin, has forced the Author to examine that point with a mi|nutene&s;s, which a di&s;pute &s;o un|important
<PB REF="4">
&s;eems not to de&s;erve. But the di&s;qui&s;itions of many learned men had given a kind of con&s;equence to the &s;ubject, when they rendered it perplexed and ob&s;cure. To extricate truth from the polemical rubbi&s;h of former antiquaries was a ta&s;k of labour; and the candid will forgive the length, on account of the pro|priety, of the di&s;qui&s;ition, e&s;pe|cially in a work which pro|fe&s;&s;edly treats of the antiquities of the Briti&s;h nations.</P>
<P>In that part of his work which relates to the di&s;putes between the Briti&s;h and Iri&s;h Scots, the Author of the Introduction de|rives much of his information from the manu&s;cript notes of the late very ingenious Dr. Macpher|&s;on, who&s;e di&s;&s;ertations on the antiquities of the northern Bri|tain are in the hands of the learn|ed. In the other provinces of
<PB REF="5">
his &s;ubject, he has availed him|&s;elf of the indu&s;try of &s;ome mo|dern writers; but he neither bor|rows their &s;entiments, nor relies upon their judgment. He looks upon antiquity through the me|dium of the ancients, and thinks he &s;ees it in its genuine &s;tate. His work is formed on the gene|ral re&s;ult of the information which the writers of Greece and Rome have tran&s;mitted from every quar|ter; and if his &s;y&s;tem is not &s;atis|factory, it, at lea&s;t, is new.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The north|ern nations aver&s;e to letters.</NOTE> THE northern nations, who&s;e cha|racter was in many re&s;pects &s;ingu|lar, were remarkable for their aver&s;ion to the &s;tudy of letters. Fierce and untrac|table by nature, and bred from their in|fancy to incur&s;ion and depredation, they
<PB N="2" REF="12">
thought every pur&s;uit not immediately &s;ub&s;ervient to the profe&s;&s;ion of arms mean and di&s;honourable. They little con&s;idered that this prejudice was a fatal enemy to the fame which they &s;ought after with &s;o much eagerne&s;s in the field. In vain were exploits worthy of memory performed, when the only certain means of tran&s;mit|ting them to po&s;terity were di&s;couraged and de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The middle ages</NOTE> In the cloud of ignorance which invol|ved them at home they advanced into the provinces of we&s;tern empire. Learning, which had long langui&s;hed among the Romans, expired with the power of that illu&s;trious people; and Europe, in a great mea&s;ure, returned to its original rudene&s;s and barbarity. When the detached tribes who had &s;ubverted the government of the Romans formed them&s;elves into regular communities &s;ome knowledge of letters began to revive; but the Chri&s;tian cler|gy, following the policy of their predece&s;|&s;ors the Druids, confined that knowledge to them&s;elves.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">unfavour|able to hi&s;tory.</NOTE> To record temporal events was not the fir&s;t u&s;e made of letters by the religious of the middle ages. Miracles, vi&s;ions, and the lives of &s;aints, were more impor|tant &s;ubjects, than the tran&s;actions of &s;tates and kingdoms, in the eyes of a race of men who&s;e influence depended upon keeping mankind in the &s;hades of igno|rance
<PB N="3" REF="13">
and &s;uper&s;tition. We find, ac|cordingly, that monks and hermits be|came illu&s;trious in cells and in de&s;erts, whil&s;t the monarchs of Europe &s;at in ob|&s;curity upon their thrones.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The feudal e&s;tabli&s;h|ments intro|duce hi&s;tori|cal inquiry.</NOTE> The North, which, upon the decline of the Romans, had filled the provinces of the we&s;tern empire with its colonies, &s;ent abroad fre&s;h armies of adventurers in the eighth and ninth ages. The&s;e, &s;et|tling in &s;ome of the regions of the South, gave a new turn to the genius of the Eu|ropean nations. The feudal e&s;tabli&s;h|ments, introduced, or at lea&s;t, revived and confirmed by them, gave &s;tability to government, and were highly favourable to a &s;pirit of national dignity and inde|pendence. Lands and honours becoming hereditary, gave birth to a pride of family among the great barons; and they en|deavoured to add lu&s;tre to the di&s;tinctions which they had acquired by tracing their ance&s;tors through the &s;ame path of emi|nence to a remote antiquity. From in|dividuals this genealogical enthu&s;ia&s;m &s;pread to whole communities. Men po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the little literature of the times, and a talent for fable, either through ig|norance or vanity, indulged the romantic pa&s;&s;ions of an ignorant race of men, by deducing the origin of their re&s;pective na|tions from very di&s;tant aeras. The anti|quities of every country in Europe furni&s;h|ed
<PB N="4" REF="14">
an ample field of fiction; and it was impo&s;&s;ible to form tales too extravagant or improbable for the credulity of the age. It is therefore no matter of wonder that we po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch a ma&s;s of legends for the ancient hi&s;tory of tho&s;e nations, who, for many centuries, have made a figure in Europe.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The hi&s;tory of ancient Britain ne|glected.</NOTE> The revival of critical learning has en|abled foreigners to extricate, in a great mea&s;ure, their antiquities from the fables of the middle ages: In Britain we con|tent our&s;elves with looking back with contempt on the credulity of our ance&s;|tors. From a pride incident to poli&s;hed times we are apt to think, and perhaps with &s;ome ju&s;tice, that the tran&s;actions of the infancy of &s;ociety are as unworthy of remembrance as they are imperfectly known. But this ob&s;ervation has been made, not more to depreciate our ance&s;|tors, than to cover a glaring defect in our|&s;elves. The Briti&s;h nations, till of late years, were much more remarkable for the performance of great actions in the field, than for recording them with digni|ty and preci&s;ion in the clo&s;et.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;ign of the Author.</NOTE> Men of abilities have removed this re|proach from the nation. The latter pe|riods of our hi&s;tory are reduced into form and preci&s;ion; but the early part of our annals &s;till remains in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of fiction and romance. To di&s;pel the
<PB N="5" REF="15">
&s;hades which cover the antiquities of the Briti&s;h nations, to inve&s;tigate their origin, to carry down &s;ome account of their cha|racter, manners, and government, into the times of records and dome&s;tic writers, is the de&s;ign of this introduction. The abilities of the Author are perhaps inade|quate to &s;o arduous an undertaking; but as he travels back into antiquity with &s;ome advantages which others have not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, he flatters him&s;elf that he &s;hall be able to throw a new, if not a &s;atis|factory light, on a &s;ubject hitherto little under&s;tood. Though, for want of &s;uffi|cient guides, he &s;hould &s;ometimes lo&s;e his way in a region of clouds and darkne&s;s, his hopes of the indulgence of the public are greater than his fears of their cen&s;ure.</P>

The Pela&s;gi of Peloponne&s;us and the I&s;lands of the Archipelago were the fir&s;t of the European Nomades who quit|ted the ambulatory life of their ance&s;tors, and applied them&s;elves to the arts of civil life. Induced by the fine climate of Greece, they &s;ettled in fixed abodes; while yet their rude brethren to the North wandered after their cattle or game over the face of Europe. Improving their navigation by degrees, they &s;ailed to the We&s;t, &s;eized upon the neare&s;t coa&s;t of Italy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> <BIBL>Dion.

Hence proceeded the Albion of the Greeks, and the Albium of the Roman language. The inhabitants of mountainous countries, who, from their &s;ituation, have very little intercour&s;e with other nations, and who were never &s;ubject to a foreign yoke, are remarkably tenacious of the local names, and their aboriginal cu&s;toms, manners, and language. We accordingly find, that the ancient Scots, in all the ages to which our information extends, agreed in calling Scotland Alba or Albania. The High|landers and the inhabitants of the He|brides have, to this day, no other name but Alba for Scotland, and they invaria|bly call them&s;elves Albanich, or genuine Britons. The uninterrupted u&s;e of this national appellation, from the earlie&s;t ac|count we have of their hi&s;tory, furni&s;hes a moral demon&s;tration that they are the true de&s;cendants of the fir&s;t inhabitants of Britain.

The Wel&s;h, in ancient times, di&s;tingui&s;hed the Scots of both the Briti&s;h I&s;les by the appellation of Gaidhel, which, as the DH are inva|riably quie&s;cent in Celtic words, is much the &s;ame with Ga&euml;l, in the pronuncia|tion.

They pre&s;erved the Ca|ledonian de&s;ignation of Ga&euml;l, or the name of Erinich, which they had a&s;&s;umed after their tran&s;migration into Ireland, and the adventitious names of Scotti and Scottia fell at la&s;t into total de&s;uetude,.</P>

Whole nations have come down into the region of true hi&s;tory without having pla|ced a tenet &s;o e&s;&s;ential to religion in their faith. The infancy of &s;ociety is not favour|able to &s;peculative inquiry. Mankind, in their rude&s;t &s;tate, &s;carce ever extend their ideas beyond objects of &s;en&s;e. They per|ceive, when death &s;u&s;pends the functions of the body, that the man cea&s;es to act and to feel; and the &s;ub&s;equent di&s;&s;olution of his whole frame e&s;tabli&s;hes the &s;uppo&s;i|tion, that his being is at an end. Nature her&s;elf confirms the opinion from every quarter by &s;ymptoms of decay. The oak

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Unknown in the fir&s;t &s;tage of &s;ociety.</NOTE> Philo&s;ophy only begins where the fir&s;t &s;tage of &s;ociety ends. As long as bodily labour is the only means of acquiring the nece&s;&s;aries of life, man has neither time or inclination to cultivate the mind. Spe|culative inquiry is the fir&s;t fruits of the lei&s;ure which civil life procures for indi|viduals; but it is extremely doubtful whether the Immortality of the Soul is among the fir&s;t truths which philo&s;ophers have re&s;cued from ignorance and barba|rity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aera of its being fir&s;t broached in Greece.</NOTE> The mo&s;t poli&s;hed nation of antiquity was late in its reception of the doctrine of the Immortality of the Soul. The Greeks, till the days of Thales<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Thales PRIMUS dixit animas e&s;&s;e immortales. <BIBL>Chaerilus Poeta.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>, had formed no idea at all concerning a future &s;tate.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Merely &s;pe|culative</NOTE> The Immortality of the Soul was, upon the whole, a doctrine merely &s;pecu|lative among the ancient Greeks.

<HEAD>Reflections on the Origin of Go|vernment.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ri&s;e and progre&s;s of &s;ociety.</NOTE> SOCIETY is of greater antiquity than government. Civil regulations confe&s;s, in their own origin, the pre|exi&s;tence of public crimes. Mankind, like other animals, herded originally toge|ther through mere in&s;tinct; and they de|ceive them&s;elves who think that commu|ties were formed under a preconcerted &s;y&s;tem of policy. Man, in his rude&s;t &s;tate, being de&s;titute of property, neither fears nor meets with inju&s;tice: He po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es nothing which his own arm cannot defend, before the love of the convenien|cies of life has overcome his neighbour's natural propen&s;ity to ju&s;tice. In the progre&s;s of &s;ociety individuals poli&s;h one another, as it were, by colli&s;ion. The fruit of the ingenuity of one is adopted and improved by another: New inven|tions &s;tart up in every quarter, and are
<PB N="243" REF="253">
lo&s;t in none: Luxury grows with the in|crea&s;e of the arts of civil life, rapacity treads clo&s;e on its heels; and then, for the fir&s;t time, the check of law and re|gulation becomes nece&s;&s;ary to the welfare, if not to the very being of the community.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Origin of monarchy.</NOTE> The popular form of government is more ancient than monarchy. The patri|archal authority from which &s;ome writers deduce the latter, is too much circum|&s;cribed in degree and time to be the foun|tain from which monarchy flows. The power which a parent has over his chil|dren cannot be tran&s;mitted to his &s;on. He derives it from nature. and it dies with him&s;elf. Regal government is a civil in&s;titution, which in various coun|tries owes its commencement to various cau&s;es. It generally takes its ri&s;e from a kind of u&s;urpation; and, whatever theori&s;ts in politics may &s;ay, there were originally no &s;tipulations made between the tyrant and the people. Length of time e&s;tabli&s;hes into a kind of right what, at the beginning, was an act of inju&s;tice; and the acquie&s;cence of the people con|&s;titutes into a moral duty that obedience which was at fir&s;t the effect of fear.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Popular go|vernment older than monarchy.</NOTE> The &s;implicity of monarchical govern|ment has e&s;tabli&s;hed with many an opi|nion of its &s;uperior antiquity. The in|fancy of &s;ociety, like that of man, mu&s;t be awed, &s;ay they, into good behaviour by
<PB N="244" REF="254">
the fear of obvious puni&s;hment. The &s;low movements of popular governments command no re&s;pect, and impre&s;s no fears; and therefore men naturally place the power of the &s;tate where it can be exerted with mo&s;t expedition and preci&s;ion. They who argue in this manner are little ac|quainted with the character of barbarous times. In the fir&s;t &s;tage of &s;ociety there is no inequality between individuals: a man's mind mu&s;t be opened with civili|zation before he will acquie&s;ce in an opi|nion of his own inferiority. The Bar|barian knows no per&s;on better than him|&s;elf, and he &s;ubmits to the dictates of none; deriving, in fact, from the vigour and independence of his own mind, that liberty which we owe to an accidental con&s;titution of government.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monarchy begins in force, and is &s;upported by influ|ence.</NOTE> Though monarchy, for the mo&s;t part, begins in the mid&s;t of tumult and war, the very exi&s;tence of regal power pre&s;up|po&s;es a con&s;iderable degree of civility in the community. The authority which the leader of a nation may acquire from per&s;onal merit in battle will die away in peace, unle&s;s the machine is kept in mo|tion by the continued impul&s;e of influ|ence; and this influence, which is the foundation, if not the origin, of kingly government, is only to be obtained by having &s;omething to be&s;tow upon abettors and dependents. A few being gained.

through the channel of intere&s;t, the many are over-awed into &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and that lenity and impartial ju&s;tice, which pru|dence dictates in the fir&s;t periods of mo|narchy, contributes to reconcile the minds of the people to the government of one.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Origin and nature of the popular form of go|vernment.</NOTE> In the early infancy of a &s;tate, the only laws that &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the community are the opinions and prejudices of the people. Before property is well e&s;tabli&s;hed, the catalogue of crimes is very &s;uccinct; and the puni&s;hments annexed to each are nei|ther &s;evere nor inflicted with preci&s;ion. The people have not yet delegated their authority to a few; and the power that remains in the hands of the many &s;eldom exerts it&s;elf with vigour. The &s;ociety is kept together more by habit, and the ab|&s;ence of vice, than by any thing which de&s;erves the name of government. The people, who have the whole power in their hands, convene only when they are to carry war into an enemy's country, or to defend their own. They con&s;ult together but on the external affairs of the community; its internal concerns are left to the opinions of individuals. This ab|&s;ence of all regulation may be called the mo&s;t ancient form of government; and it may be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the title of a popular government, as the opinions of the people in general are the only checks upon the crimes and irregularities of in|dividuals.</P>

It is however certain, that this mark of their own great|ne&s;s, which the Romans &s;eem to have left in the conquered provinces, proceeded more from the reputation of their litera|ture than from the power of their arms. The illu&s;trious nation had too much &s;en&s;e to endeavour to impo&s;e their own language upon the conquered; and, had they even departed from their u&s;ual political prudence on that head, it is &s;carcely credible, that they could have &s;ucceeded in the attempt. All other conquering nations, to whom hi&s;tory extends its information, failed in their endeavours of the &s;ame kind.

The &s;ervants of the court, the attendants of the prince, the po&s;terity of the victors, in general, may retain the tongue of their original country; but the bulk of the peo|ple will al&s;o retain that which de&s;cended to them from their fathers. The Ro|mans them&s;elves could never extend the Latin to the Provinces of the Ea&s;t; on the contrary, the language of their Greek va&s;&s;als prevailed, at la&s;t, over their own. The ob&s;tinate de&s;poti&s;m of William the Conqueror, and the per&s;everance of tho&s;e Norman and French princes who &s;ucceed|ed him in the throne of England, could not force the language of France on the Engli&s;h nation; and the Lombards and Franks lo&s;t their own Sarmatic dialect in the tongues of Italy and Gaul.

<HEAD>Reflections on the Fall of the Romans.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cau&s;e of the &s;tability of the Ro|man empire,</NOTE> The Romans differed not more from other nations in the ri&s;e and progre&s;s, than in the extent and permanence of their power. The fall of the republic, by melting down into one ma&s;s all di&s;tinc|tions of party, gave &s;tability and weight to the &s;tate, when it de&s;troyed the im|portance of the members of which it was compo&s;ed. Feeble and corrupted in the center, the empire threw all its vigour and &s;trength into its frontier, and became formidable abroad in the mid&s;t of dome&s;tic decay. The di&s;putes about the purple, though frequent and bloody, were but partial &s;hocks; they agitated and di&s;turb|ed, but did neither break nor ruin the great fabric of the &s;tate. The &s;torms were violent, but they did not la&s;t long;
<PB N="276" REF="286">
and things were &s;oon re&s;tored to their original balance by the tranquility of ab|&s;olute government.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">In what dif|ferent from other mo|narchies.</NOTE> The de&s;potic empires of A&s;ia rai&s;ed by the abilities of one prince fall through the weakne&s;s of another: the fate of the &s;tate is involved with the life of the mo|narch, and when he dies in battle, or by the hands of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, the great body, of which he was the head, &s;ubmits to a foreign conqueror, or &s;eparates into petty principalities under dome&s;tic tyrants. The imperial authority at Rome &s;tood upon a more &s;olid foundation. When the Julian family reduced the Roman re|public into an empire for them&s;elves, they did not change in appearance the ancient form of government. Though a new power &s;tarted up in the &s;tate, all the old offices remained. De&s;poti&s;m had the de|cency to cover oppre&s;&s;ion with a ma&s;k, and to execute its mo&s;t rigorous plans through channels neither unknown nor formidable in the days of freedom. The power of the fir&s;t Cae&s;ars con&s;i&s;ted in influence; and an overawed and venal &s;enate were the obvious in&s;truments of their tyranny.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the permanency of the em|pire</NOTE> The interference of the imperial au|thority was confined to matters of &s;tate. The detail of inferior government, the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice between individuals re|mained in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of ancient forms. The oppre&s;&s;ions of the wor&s;t of the Cae&s;ars

&s;carce ever extended beyond the walls of Rome; and the provinces which had lan|gui&s;hed under the exactions of republican praefects flouri&s;hed under the lieutenants of a Caligula and a Nero. Though, ve&s;ted with the &s;acredne&s;s of his tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">uni|tian authority, no laws could bind the emperor, the empire it&s;elf was governed, in fact, by a regular &s;y&s;tem of laws; and therefore, when the tyrant fell, the &s;tate was not involved in his ruin.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">did not de|pend on the fate of the prince.</NOTE> There was one other cau&s;e which pre|vented the permanence of the Empire from depending on the fate of the prince. The hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which the Julian family endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h, expired with Nero; and the &s;uffrage of the army, confirmed by the approbation of a timid and complying &s;enate, became the only nece&s;&s;ary title to the throne. Men rai&s;ed by accidental influence to the imperial dignity, though they inforced obedience, could command neither re&s;pect nor attachment from a people among whom they them&s;elves had been &s;o lately numbered as private per&s;ons. The mul|titude, who are, in every age and nation, the great &s;upporters of hereditary mo|narchy, found no re&s;ting-place for their loyalty in the fluctuations of imperial &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and they acquie&s;ced, without reluctance, in the government of any ambitious leader, who had paved his way

to the purple by private treachery or by open force.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The exten|&s;ion of the freedom of the city the fir&s;t cau&s;e of decline.</NOTE> One of the be&s;t of tho&s;e, who held the reins of government at Rome, ha&s;|tened the di&s;&s;olution of the empire more than the very wor&s;t of his predece&s;&s;ors. The fir&s;t Antonine, by extending the freedom of the city to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dion Ca&s;&s;ius &s;ays, that this was the act of Ant. Cara|calla, but other writers of credit affirm the contrary. It was only, perhaps, the freedom of Latium that was extended to the provinces by Antoninus Pius; that of the city by Caracalla.</NOTE> all the provinces, broke down the fence of di&s;tinction which, even in the mid&s;t of degeneracy, protected &s;ome &s;mall remains of the old Roman &s;pi|rit. When the exclu&s;ive privilege of ci|tizens was no longer confined to Italy, the awe which the conquered nations had for the original &s;eat of greatne&s;s gradually decayed. When, to be born within the walls of Rome no longer conferred any peculiar immunities, that my&s;terious tie, which bound the attachment of the citi|zen him&s;elf to the re&s;idence of his an|ce&s;tors, was broken; and the veneration once annexed to the Roman name became naturally feeble, when the name it&s;elf was diffu&s;ed over half the world.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The ab&s;ence of all &s;pirit in the pro|vinces.</NOTE> But this cau&s;e of di&s;&s;olution was neither obvious in its commencement nor rapid in its progre&s;s. The total ab&s;ence of all

&s;pirit in the provinces balanced, for &s;ome time, its decline in Italy. The debility which tyranny and luxury carried from Rome through all its dominions, even contributed, though the opinion is &s;ingu|lar, to the permanency and &s;tability of the empire. The conquered nations, by be|ing deprived of their arms, applied them|&s;elves to tho&s;e enervating arts, which, by admini&s;tering to luxury, deprave when they poli&s;h the human mind. Timid and habituated to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, they fell in love with the tranquillity of de&s;poti&s;m; and in a kind of determination to conti|nue &s;laves, they became indifferent about the title and virtues of their tyrant. The news of his acce&s;&s;ion was enough to e|&s;tabli&s;h the authority of any prince in the mo&s;t di&s;tant regions of the empire; and many provinces were &s;o di&s;pirited and pa&s;&s;ive, that a military force was found altogether unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure their obe|dience. No attempt at independence could be made by &s;uch an inactive body. Men were either ignorant of the natural rights of their &s;pecies, or meanly re&s;igned them for the abject &s;ecurity of &s;ervitude.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The general debility &s;preading to the army.</NOTE> The infectious debility which had &s;eized the other &s;ubjects of Rome, did not, for &s;ome centuries after the extinction of liberty, overwhelm its armies. Born in the more di&s;tant parts of the empire, and &s;tationed on its frontier, the &s;oldier
<PB N="280" REF="290">
was a &s;tranger to tho&s;e enervating vices which extingui&s;h the martial &s;pirit. When the legions followed an ambitious leader to Rome, a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from &s;ervice was the common reward of their fidelity; and if they were depraved by licence, they were &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated and lo&s;t in the ge|neral imbecillity of the body of the peo|ple. They were &s;ucceeded in the pre&s;i|dial provinces by new levies of hardy and uncorrupted barbarians, who pre&s;erved an appearance of vigour in the extremi|ties of the empire, after the center had exhibited every &s;ymptom of political de|cay.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The remo|val of the &s;eat of go|vernment.</NOTE> The impolitic vanity of Con&s;tantine, in removing the &s;eat of empire to a new capital, gave a mortal blow to the Ro|man &s;tate. The &s;enate, who&s;e con&s;e|quence and authority had declined with their virtue, were, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, an|nihilated by being tran&s;planted to another place. The name, even the very walls of Rome, contained &s;omething within them which commanded obedience from the provinces. The opinion which &s;up|ports all government was de&s;troyed, by turning the attention of the people to a quarter to which they were not accu&s;|tomed to look. They were habituated to obey implicitly the mandates of Ro|man emperors and Roman &s;enates; but to Bizantine princes and a&s;&s;emblies they
<PB N="281" REF="291">
paid only that cold and unwilling obe|dience which force extorts from &s;laves. To complete at once the ruin of that mighty fabric which the policy and vir|tue of ancient Rome had rai&s;ed, Con&s;tan|tine, by creating new offices and by changing the names of many of the old, altered the con&s;titution of the Roman government This prince, in &s;hort, who covered with &s;plendid exploits, in public life, the meanne&s;s and even wickedne&s;s of his private character, was more fatal to the permanancy of the Roman power, e&s;pecially in the We&s;t, than the mo&s;t wretched and impolitic of his predece&s;&s;ors in the imperial dignity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">gives a mor|tal blow to the empire.</NOTE> Julian, though endued with all the &s;pi|rit, abilities, and even virtues of the old Romans, came too late into the world to &s;top the rapid progre&s;s of the &s;tate to its decline. His untimely death extingui&s;h|ed the la&s;t hopes of Rome. The vigour and prudence with which he conducted his mea&s;ures in his early youth &s;erve only to &s;hew what he might have been in his riper years. Had he lived, there was a chance for the future permanency of the empire, a certainty of its temporary greatne&s;s. He fell, and the whole fabric of Roman power nodded to its fall when he died. The circum&s;cribed abilities of &s;ome of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors &s;upported, for a few years, a part of the venerable ruin; but

<HEAD>General Reflections on the Sarmatae.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Bar|barians who were the &s;econdary cau&s;e of the fall of Rome.</NOTE> The bad policy of Con&s;tantine and the imbecillity which gradually aro&s;e from advanced civility and &s;lavery, though they were the great, were not the only, cau&s;e of the ruin of Rome. The Barbarians of the North and Ea&s;t, who have even pervaded the regions of A&s;ia it&s;elf with their migrations, gave the fini&s;hing blow to a &s;tate already tottering to its fall. Wandering like bea&s;ts of prey on the &s;kirts of their own de&s;erts, they &s;aw the luxuries which prevailed within the Ro|man pale, and they made many attempts to break into the fold. Whil&s;t vigour and di&s;cipline remained among the legions on the frontiers, they repelled with ea&s;e the irregular incur&s;ions of the naked Tar|tars of the North and Ea&s;t. But after the general effeminacy had extended it&s;elf to the army, enemies who, in the better days of Rome, were de&s;pi&s;ed, became formidable and victorious. The fence being once broken down, the deluge &s;oon

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The ob&s;cu|rity in which they were invol|ved.</NOTE> It were in vain to attempt to penetrate the darkne&s;s which involved, at home, the Sarmatae, who &s;ucceeded the Romans in the regions of the We&s;t. De&s;titute of means of conveying their own annals to po&s;terity, the fir&s;t feeble light of hi&s;tory was thrown upon them when they &s;hewed them&s;elves, in a ho&s;tile manner, on the frontiers of the empire. The writers who have &s;ent down the earlie&s;t ac|count of their inva&s;ions, a&s;toni&s;hed at their appearance, and alarmed at their cru|elties, &s;eem to have been more anxious to de&s;cribe what they then were, than what they had formerly been. They pu&s;hed not their inquiry into the origin of Bar|barians who&s;e ravages conveyed the fir&s;t news of their name; and they were little &s;olicitous about examining into the previous hi&s;tory of a rude race of men, who&s;e in|cur&s;ions into the Roman territories were perhaps their fir&s;t public tran&s;action.
