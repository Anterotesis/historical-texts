<P>MISS Wildman having opened her&s;elf &s;o much to her maid re&s;pecting me, and which, he con|ceiving could &s;aid only with a view of my hearing it again, I took an opportunity one morning, when &s;he came into Charlotte's room, to reque&s;t her private ear for five mi|nutes.
<PB N="6" REF="3">With great and amiable good-nature, &s;he &s;ent her maid into her room to adju&s;t her toilet, when I addre&s;&s;ed her in the following man|ner. <Q>If it be not an act of the highe&s;t pre&s;umption, Madam, for one in <HI>my</HI> humble &s;tation in life, to declare an attachment to a young lady of your rank and fortune; if it be not an offence again&s;t propriety and duty, to &s;o|licit your attention to any tale of mine; I would venture to repre|&s;ent to you, that thought you &s;ee me here as your father's valet, I am a gentleman both by birth and education, and am not a great way removed from a ve|ry
<PB N="7" REF="4">con&s;iderable landed property. There is an e&s;tate of four thou&s;and pounds a year, in the family, and my hopes of one day inheriting it, are not wild and romantic. I mention this only to induce your favourable hearing.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Mr. Gabriel,</Q> &s;aid &s;he, interrupting me, <Q>from the time I fir&s;t &s;aw you, I was convinced, that, though wearing a livery, you had been bred to better expectations;&mdash;but as you have been the pre&s;erver of my honour, and have ri&s;ked your life in my defence, whether &s;er|vant or ma&s;ter, you are equally en|titled to my regard and gratitude.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Talk not of gratitude! my dear
<PB N="8" REF="5">Mi&s;s Wildman,</Q> exclaimed I; for her &s;weet conde&s;cen&s;ion gave me greater confidence, <Q>talk not of gratitude; what I did, was a du|ty due from my &s;ex to yours, and if it merits your &s;imple thanks, I am over-paid. My humble character in life will not &s;uffer me to make advances, but &s;hould fortune, at any future pe|riod, put us nearer on an equali|ty, may I hope for &s;omething more than your regard?</Q>&mdash;<Q>I am of too &s;elfi&s;h a nature,</Q> re|turns Mi&s;s Wildman, <Q>not to ac|knowledge, that were I mi&s;tre&s;s of worlds, you have de&s;erved them all. I have a heart, it is
<PB N="9" REF="6">true, to give again, but what is my poor heart without my hand? <HI>That</HI> is at my father's di&s;po&s;al; was it at my command, I would enter further into the &s;ubject.</Q> <Q>A thou&s;and ble&s;&s;ings on you, my dear Mi&s;s Wildman, for this ge|nerous declaration,</Q> cried I in rapture, taking her hand, which &s;he readily gave me, <Q>let me extort but one declaration more, and, poor as I am, I &s;hall be the hap|pie&s;t of men.</Q> <Q>Your good &s;en&s;e, Mr. Gabriel,</Q> returned &s;he, <Q>will, I am per&s;uaded, pre|vent your urging me to &s;ay any thing I ought not to &s;ay: what I am mi&s;tre&s;s of, you may
<PB N="10" REF="7">command; what I have not to give, you cannot expect.</Q> <Q>I have too high a veneration for you, my dear Mi&s;s Wildman,</Q> replied I, &s;till holding her by the hand, <Q>to urge the lea&s;t impro|priety: you have frankly confe&s;&s;|ed your heart is &s;till at liberty, but not your hand; I a&s;k not your hand at pre&s;ent, but &s;olicit only your heart, and that you will give me a chance, by time, of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the former; at lea&s;t, that you will promi&s;e me not to be&s;tow the one, where you can|not yield the other.</Q> This &s;he &s;olemnly promi&s;ed; "her heart," &s;he &s;aid, <Q>I had won, and it was
<PB N="11" REF="8">mine; &s;he had only to lament that &s;he could not give her hand as readily.</Q> Charlotte that in|&s;tant entering the room, &s;he left me, but &s;aid &s;he would take the fir&s;t opportunity of &s;eeing me a|gain</P>
<P>SHE kept her word the next morning, and brought me an enam|elled ring, of no great value in deed, otherwi&s;e than as a proof of having re-con&s;idered the matter, and thus ratifying her determination. "Take, my dear Gabriel," &s;ays &s;he, <Q>this ring, as a pledge of my &s;incerity, that while <HI>you</HI> are liv|ing, as I have thought proper to
<PB N="12" REF="9">pre&s;ent you my <HI>heart,</HI> no man el&s;e &s;hall have my <HI>hand.</HI>&mdash;</Q> <Q>I take it, my dear Mi&s;s Wildman,</Q> returned I, pre&s;&s;ing it with her hand to my lips, <Q>as the be&s;t gift be|low, Heaven has to give; and if I prove unworthy of the gift, may I never know bli&s;s hereafter. I call you the mo&s;t generous of women, as the difference of my &s;ituation in life from your's, puts me at too great a di&s;tance to have any expectations.</Q> <Q><HI>Situation,</HI> my dear Gabriel,</Q> replied &s;he, <Q>is an idle term. On the footing of nature, we are all equal, and if there are any circum&s;tances in the eye of the world, that rai&s;e one
<PB N="13" REF="10">per&s;on above another, or di&s;tin|gui&s;h individuals, it is a great|er &s;hare of moral virtue, or of mental or corporal endowments, given us by Providence and im|proved by art. You have to boa&s;t of the&s;e, and of cour&s;e, are far before half the gentlemen I have the honour to know. In alliances for life, to &s;ecure a com|petency, without which happi|ne&s;s is merely ideal, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ult intere&s;t and pay &s;ome regard to fortune; but where there is &s;ufficient property on one &s;ide to en&s;ure that compe|tency, to look for it on the other, is mercenary and covetous. My
<PB N="14" REF="11">father is able to give me a for|tune, adequate to my utmo&s;t wi&s;hes; and whenever the time &s;hall come, that I am in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that, or you be in a &s;ituation not to want it, you &s;hall com|mand my <HI>hand,</HI> as you do now my <HI>heart.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THUS, in an endearing enjoy|ment of a reciprocity of affection, through the confidence of Charlotte, and the convenience of her room, did many days glide &s;moothly on. But after I had been in the family about &s;ix weeks; with a kind of terror in her countenance, Mi&s;s Wildman brought me the following
<PB N="15" REF="12">letter, which &s;he had received from Lord B.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Thou mo&s;t cruel of women,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have been long at lo&s;s to ac|count for your indifference, but the cau&s;e I am now acquainted with, that of having a rival among your father's <HI>&s;ervants.</HI> I have too much pride to acquaint Mr. Wildman with the fact, but I &s;hall watch the &s;coundrel's motions and remove him from you."</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your injured B&mdash;.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I SMILED at the threat and reque&s;ted her to make her&s;elf ea&s;y under it, for as fear was no part of my compo&s;ition, I
<PB N="16" REF="13">&s;hould be always upon my guard; but, if at any time, I was betrayed, by any of my fellow-&s;ervants, and prevented a night from &s;leeping at home, &s;he &s;hould hear immediately from me. She a&s;&s;ured me, her alarm was not very great upon the occa&s;ion, as &s;he conceived the letter to be a menace only; her greate&s;t unhappine&s;s was, that if any information had been given to him, through a &s;u&s;picion of the &s;ervants, it might reach her fa|ther's ears, through the &s;ame chan|nel, and occa&s;ion a great deal of un|happine&s;s; for though no man was more warm in his friend&s;hips, no one was more violent in his re&s;entments. Should &s;uch a thing take place, I
<PB N="17" REF="14">told her, whether I was in the hou&s;e, or out of it, &s;he had my con|&s;ent to di&s;own it, and if I was call|ed upon, I would do the &s;ame.</P>
<P>THE alarm, however, cau&s;ed me many an unquiet moment. I had too good an opinion of Charlotte to think <HI>&s;he</HI> would betray me, and I was not con&s;cious it was known to any other part of the family. Lord B. might po&s;&s;ibly have heard that I was taken into the hou&s;e, and his jealou&s;y might lead him to form a thou&s;and conceptions, and he might fix on this, in order to mortify Mi&s;s Wildman's pride. However, from the tenor of the letter and from what
<PB N="18" REF="15">I heard at Mrs. Duplex's, I was de|termined to be prepared for any vio|lent attack, and therefore never went out afterwards, but with a tuck cane and a brace of pi&s;tols loaded.</P>
<P>THE third day after Mi&s;s Wildman had &s;hewn me Lord B's letter, I was going out in the evening about &s;ix o'clock, in the month of Oc|tober, and it was then ju&s;t at the clo&s;e of day; I had on a blue &s;urtout-coat with a red cape, and plain hat with gilt button and loop; and &s;carce had the porter opened the outer door, but I heard a voice &s;ay, <Q>That's he.</Q> At this, I rather drew back, and a man in a chairman's
<PB N="19" REF="16">coat, ran up the &s;teps towards me, and, with a tuck in his hand, made an attempt to &s;eize me; I &s;truck him upon the arm with my cane, and with my foot thru&s;t him down off the &s;teps; at that in&s;tant I &s;aw two men more making up to me, armed with bludgeons, one had nearly reached me, on which I took out one of my pi&s;tols and fired it, and as, I believe, killed him on the &s;pot. I then turn|ed round, in order to take &s;helter within the hou&s;e, and found that the porter tried all he could to &s;hut the door again&s;t me; I overpowered him, however, with &s;trength, forced my way in, bolted the door upon my enemy, and with the but end of my
<PB N="20" REF="17">pi&s;tol, laid the porter flat upon the floor. All this took place in le&s;s time than I have been telling it. Finding my&s;elf &s;o far &s;afe, I ran backwards towards the &s;tables, pul|led off my &s;urtout coat that I might not be known, tore the button and loop from my hat, and made my e&s;cape into the Meu&s;e, in which our &s;tables &s;tood. As &s;oon as I found my&s;elf at liberty, I pu&s;hed away to a neighbouring &s;tand of coaches, got into one and bid the coachman drive me towards St. Giles's church. When I was out of the reach of any pur&s;uit, I began to con&s;ider what was proper to be done. Perfectly con|vinced from the porter's endeavour|ing
<PB N="21" REF="18">to &s;hut me out, that he mu&s;t be a party concerned, I determined to write to my ma&s;ter, and beg him to &s;tand my friend and lea&s;t a war|rant &s;hould be i&s;&s;ued to apprehend me, to get off, the next morning, to &s;ome di&s;tance from London. When I was near the end of Oxford Road, I ordered the coachman to &s;et me down, walked on about half a mile, went into a tavern and wrote a let|ter, of which the following is a copy:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WILL not preface this letter with its cau&s;e; er'e this, you are too well acquainted with it, I am &s;afe at pre|&s;ent
<PB N="22" REF="19">from any fear of danger or of being apprehended. From a decla|ration of Lord B's at Mrs. Duplex's, &s;ince I had the honour of being u&s;e|ful to Mi&s;s Wildman, that he would take an opportunity to be revenged of me, and from &s;ome other circum|&s;tances, I have rea&s;on to believe, that he way-laid me at your door; for, on my going out, a fellow, in a chairman's coat, with a tuck in his hand, endeavoured to lay hold of me. I beat his arm down with my cane, and with my foot thru&s;t him from the &s;teps; at this in&s;tant two more fellows with bludgeons endeavour|ed to lay violent hands on me, the foremo&s;t I fired at and po&s;&s;ibly may
<PB N="23" REF="20">have killed, for I &s;aw him fall. At|tempting to return into the hou&s;e, John, your porter, did all he could to prevent it, by forcing the door again&s;t me; I &s;ucceeded, however, contrary to his wi&s;hes, and from a conviction that he mu&s;t, from &s;uch conduct, have been privy to the de|&s;ign again&s;t me, I knocked the &s;coundrel down with my pi&s;tol. If he lived to ri&s;e again, you will probably, by having him before a magi&s;trate, come at the bottom of this dark affair; I tru&s;t you will do it, not only in ju&s;tice to your&s;elf and the world; but to your unfortunate, but re&s;pectful humble &s;ervant,</P>

<P>P.S. Part of the fifty pounds you was plea&s;ed to give me, is in my trunk in my room, which I beg leave to commit to your di&s;po&s;al, having &s;ufficient money for my pre&s;ent occa&s;ions.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>I thought of writing to Mi&s;s Wild|man, according to my promi&s;e; but, dropped it, le&s;t my letter &s;hould have been intercepted by her father; and as I knew &s;he would be made acquainted with my &s;ituation from what I had written to <HI>him.</HI> I walked into the Strand with this letter and thence di&s;patched a chairman with it to Berkley Square. This done, I found my mind at ea&s;e, went into a coffee-hou&s;e, got me &s;ome refre&s;h|ment
<PB N="25" REF="22">reconnoitred the depth of my pur&s;e, which contained rather better than three guineas, and went out, about ten o'clock, in que&s;t of a lodging; which, in order to elude all &s;earch, I determined &s;hould be in one of tho&s;e hou&s;es, in the nar|row part of St. Giles's, where va|grants are taken in at two-pence a night. I &s;oon found out &s;uch a lodging, and that my dre&s;s might create no &s;u&s;picion, I turned my coat wrong &s;ide outwards, loo&s;ened the knees of my breeches, &s;louched my hat, rolled my&s;elf in the kennel, and affected to be in liquor. It an|&s;wered all the purpo&s;es I wi&s;hed, and I was &s;hewn up to a bed, without
<PB N="26" REF="23">&s;heets, where &s;ome poor wretch was already lain and fa&s;t &s;leep. I was no &s;ooner in the room, than the man, who &s;hewed me up-&s;tairs, a&s;ked me for two-pence for my lodging, lock|ed the door upon me, and told me, when I ro&s;e and cho&s;e to be let out, to ring the bell. He left me no candle, and all the light I had was from a lamp on the &s;tair-ca&s;e, that gave light within the room, by a little window over the door. I could not find out by that light what kind of a per&s;on my bed-fellow was, but I examined his cloaths, and, by the be&s;t conjecture I could make, &s;up|po&s;ed him to be a labouring man. His breeches were leather, but exceed|ingly
<PB N="27" REF="24">grea&s;y, and neither &s;trings nor buckles at the knees; his wai&s;tcoat had been &s;carlet, but it had but one flap and four buttons, and his coat was originally what is called a thick&s;et, but out at the elbows; his hat round, but grown brown with age, and his &s;tockings blue wor&s;ted, but full of darns; they were, however, toler|ably well mended and pretty clean. I tried on the coat and wai&s;tcoat and found they fitted me well enough. The reader will perhaps wonder at all this; but, when I tell him my de|&s;ign, he will wonder no longer. My plan was to ri&s;e before he waked and change cloaths with him, that I might get into the country, in &s;uch
<PB N="28" REF="25">di&s;gui&s;e without fear of interruption. As I was not much di&s;po&s;ed for &s;leep, I &s;urveyed my room, and found the furniture con&s;i&s;ted of a broken chair or two, a table with three legs, an old &s;tove in the fire-place, with a &s;hovel and poker chained to the chimney, perhaps, le&s;t a lodger &s;hould be plea&s;ed to make free with them; and le&s;t we &s;hould carry a|way the blankets was the rea&s;on, I pre&s;ume, of our being locked in. Bad as the bed was, I laid me down upon it, but could not get a wink of &s;leep; therefore, when I heard the watchman cry four, my companion being &s;till &s;noring, I dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in his cloaths, except his &s;hoes, and in|&s;tead
<PB N="29" REF="26">of four pence half penny and a lit|tle tobacco which I found in his pock|et, I left the poor devil half a crown, and flattered my&s;elf he would not be unhappy at the change; for though di&s;tre&s;&s;ed at my own &s;ituation, I could not but feel for his. I next cut my hair &s;hort in the poll, with a knife, I had in my pocket, and pulled it over my forehead; and could I have &s;een my&s;elf, I have no doubt but I &s;hould have &s;tarted at my own figure. When completely dre&s;|&s;ed, I rung the bell, and was let out, the chamberlain turning the key upon the man I had left a&s;leep. The fel|low &s;aid nothing to me, nor I to him, and I walked off as compo&s;ed, as if I had nothing to trouble me.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="27">It being rather a cold morning, I walked ha&s;tily towards Hyde-Park corner, without any thing about me of value, except, my pi&s;tols, my cane, my buckles, my ring, my &s;hirt and my pocket handkerchief, and about three pounds in money. I was pre&s;ently overtaken by the Exeter coach, and got up into the ba&s;ket.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<P>IT being very cold upon the road, I found the want of a great coat much, and at the inn where the coach breakfa&s;ted, I got luckily equip|ped with one. On my &s;aying in the kitchen I felt the weather cold, and would gladly give my &s;hoe buckles, which were &s;ilver and fa&s;hionable; in exchange for a great coat, a gentle|man's
<PB N="32" REF="29">&s;ervant by the fire-&s;ide, em|braced the propo&s;al, &s;aid, <Q>he had a good livery coat to di&s;po&s;e of, blue with a white cape, which he thought would fit me, and if I liked it, he would &s;wap with me.</Q> He fetched down the coat from above, being a lodger in the hou&s;e, the bargain was immediately &s;truck, and he gave me the coat and his metal buckles in exchange for mine: I put it on an in&s;tantly forgot my &s;itu|ation; &s;o much happine&s;s does a little degree of comfort create. The only thing I noticed worth remark|ing at this hou&s;e was, that &s;ome of the coach gentry had found fault with the tea, and de&s;ired fre&s;h might
<PB N="33" REF="30">be brought; but the girl put the fame into a fre&s;h canni&s;ter, and car|ried it in again, at which they were plea&s;ed. On my &s;miling at this, &s;he told me, <Q>&s;he often did &s;o, for travellers &s;eldom knew good tea from bad, or good wine from bad; that they found fault fre|quently for the &s;ake of finding fault, and thought by calling about them to give them&s;elves con&s;equence; that &s;he had lived long enough in an inn to know their trim; and always turned the tables upon them; and if at any time they di&s;liked the tea or the wine, &s;he carried in the &s;ame again in a fre&s;h canni&s;ter, or changed
<PB N="34" REF="31">the other for a fre&s;h bottle of the &s;ame wine, and it was immedi|ately prai&s;ed with a 'This is <HI>&s;ome|thing</HI> like!' Why had not you brought us this before?</Q> The ridiculou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uch conduct will be better di&s;played by the following anecdote, to which I was a witne&s;s, at a place of entertainment in the neigh|bourhood of London. <Q>Three or four military gentlemen, who affect|ed to be judges of wine, had called for a bottle of Li&s;bon. The fir&s;t who ta&s;ted it, &s;aid, it was prick|ed, and a&s;ked the opinion of the re&s;t. One who boa&s;ted in a &s;upe|rior knowledge of wines, &s;aid 'let <HI>me</HI> ta&s;te it,' and having taken half a
<PB N="35" REF="32">gla&s;s, worked it about in his mouth and &s;pit it out on the floor, with a 'pricked!' Zounds, 'tis <HI>&s;our.</HI> In &s;hort, they all agreed it was d-mned bad, and not fit to be drank. The waiter was called, and, a&s;&s;erting it to be Li&s;|bon and &s;uch as no gentleman had ever di&s;liked, he was ordered to &s;end his ma&s;ter; the waiter having told his ma&s;ter the com|plaint, the ma&s;ter a&s;&s;ured the gen|tlemen that it was good Li&s;bon, that he gave the be&s;t price for his wines, and was &s;orry they di&s;ap|proved of it. 'Zounds, fellow,' &s;ays one, 'do you &s;uppo&s;e we have neither ta&s;te nor judgment?'
<PB N="36" REF="33">Ta&s;te it <HI>your&s;elf.'</HI> The ma&s;ter ta&s;ted it&mdash;told the gentlemen, he was &s;orry for the accident&mdash;it was a mi&s;take of the waiter, who had brought them <HI>Old Hock</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Li&s;bon,</HI> but he would change it for them immediately. They looked round upon each other with a ridiculous &s;urpri&s;e at their own ignorance, and replied, '<HI>Hock</HI> is it?&mdash;Well, if it be <HI>Hock,</HI> you may leave it;' and were thus con|tented to pay &s;even &s;hillings, for what they would not give half a crown for before.</Q>&mdash;But, to pur|&s;ue the thread of my &s;tory.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="34">AT the end of the fir&s;t day's journey, I quitted the coach, and determined to travel on foot. Hav|ing loaded my pi&s;tols, in order to &s;e|cure the little money I had, I, the next day, broke out of the high road, to cro&s;s a part of the New Fore&s;t in Hamp&s;hire, as undetermined as when I fir&s;t &s;et out which way to proceed; and I had &s;carce walked a mile from the town where I lay, but I was acco&s;ted by two men in tattered garments, having clubbed &s;ticks in their hands, with <Q>Which way are you going, my boy?</Q> My beard was of four days growth, and I looked as rough, and as uncouth as either of them. I told them <Q>I
<PB N="38" REF="35">was a &s;tranger to the country, and hardly knew which way I was go|ing.</Q> "Come then," &s;ays one of them <Q>let's &s;ee what you are made of; turn out your pockets.</Q> On this I threw open my great coat and took one of my pi&s;tols in my hand, and they &s;tarted back; not expect|ing, I apprehend, to find me armed.

<PB N="42" REF="39">ratification of the covenant between us, and then followed them. They informed me, that their company con&s;i&s;ted of &s;eventeen &s;tout men, be|tween twenty years of age and fifty, and that it was of many years &s;tand|ing; that &s;ometimes they have been more in number, &s;ometimes le&s;s, as now and then one of them died, and now and then would one of them fall into the hands of ju&s;tice, and they lo&s;t him; that they were well known throughout the whole fore&s;t, and were con&s;idered by the inhabi|ants as a nece&s;&s;ary evil; as, for one lawle&s;s crime they committed, they prevented many. Not putting the greate&s;t confidence in the&s;e my new
<PB N="43" REF="40">friends, I made them rather walk before me, telling them, <Q>that as we became better acquainted, I, probably, &s;hould not be &s;o mi&s;|tru&s;tful.</Q> They took what I &s;aid in good part; and told me, <Q>they thought we &s;hould reach their place of rendezvous by the hour of meeting, which was eleven o'clock.</Q> They led me through many intricate and by-paths, and I ob&s;erved, that though we pa&s;&s;ed &s;e|veral fore&s;ters, none took any more notice of us, than merely looking back upon us after we had pa&s;&s;ed them. One per&s;on we met, indeed, &s;topped and told us, his hen-roo&s;t had been robbed the night before, and
<PB N="44" REF="41">a&s;ked the man, who&s;e name was Nim, whether he had heard any thing of it; he a&s;&s;ured him, he had not; for, I found, on conver&s;ing with them, that they &s;uffered no plunder in the place, if they could help it, but what they committed them&s;elves. "As for our&s;elves," &s;ays Nim, <Q>we act with genero&s;ity, and never take, but from tho&s;e who can afford to lo&s;e.</Q> I ob|&s;erved to them, <Q>it would be hap|py for this country, if all men could boa&s;t the &s;ame; for it was the misfortune of the wretched ever to be the prey of the rapacious.</Q> "By G-d, Nim," &s;ays Trig; for that was the name of the other hon|ourable
<PB N="45" REF="42">&s;coundrel, I had been plea&s;ed to take by the hand; <Q>this &s;eems to be a good fellow, he mu&s;t be our ruler next year;</Q> (and to this mark of their approbation I made a bow of acknowledgement.) They told me, <Q>that one of the company was annually cho&s;en ruler by a majority of the re&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>As we travelled on, they were very de&s;irous of knowing my hi&s;|tory, and what led me to withdraw my&s;elf from the world; &s;uch ad|venturous parts of my &s;tory, as I thought would rai&s;e me in their opinion, I made them acquainted with, under a feigned name; but
<PB N="46" REF="43">every other circum&s;tance I carefully concealed. When I had ended my own &s;tory, I begged to know theirs.</P>
<P>NIM told me, he had been rider to a notorious &s;muggler, in the county of Su&s;&s;ex, who ama&s;&s;ed a con&s;ider|able &s;um of money by leaguing with the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers; for, &s;ays he, though the&s;e men are appointed by government to look after and guard the revenue, they are the greate&s;t villains in the world. They betray their tru&s;t, and &s;erve them&s;elves at the expence of the &s;tate.&mdash;"But herein," re|turned I, <Q>they do no more than other great men of the age are
<PB N="47" REF="44">accu&s;tomed to.</Q>&mdash;"True," con|tinued he, <Q>I don't at all blame them. Every man for him&s;elf, and God for us all.</Q> On my de&s;iring to know &s;ome of the methods he pur&s;ued, Nim gave me the following account.</P>
<P><Q>SMUGGLERS fin it their in|tere&s;t to bring &s;uch articles into this country as bear a heavy duty.</Q> <Q>Tobacco-&s;talks, for example,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>are a fine article of commerce in this way. The fir&s;t co&s;t of a ton weight of the&s;e &s;talks at Dunkirk, is not more than about forty &s;hillings, and the duty being near forty-eight
<PB N="48" REF="45">pounds, they wil &s;ell to he Spani&s;h cutters in London, who convert them into &s;nuff, for fifty pounds a ton. Here then is a fine profit; if we can di&s;po&s;e of them for forty pounds, admit the fir&s;t co&s;t and expences amount to five pounds, the &s;muggler gains thirty-five pounds. Now this thir|ty-five pounds enables him to bribe the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers in the neighbourhood where they are landed; they are made up in half hundred bags for the convenience of carriage by the coaches and ma|chines, and the officers will pa&s;s forty of the&s;e packages, that is, a ton weight, for forty &s;hillings.</Q>&mdash;If
<PB N="49" REF="46">the importer wi&s;hes to &s;muggle in a larger quantity of &s;talks at a time, than one or two tons, and carry them to any con&s;iderable di&s;tance from their landing, he &s;ometimes gets an officer to &s;eize them, and mark them with the broad R; and if, under this fal&s;e &s;eizure, the goods reach the de&s;tined place unob&s;erved, the offi|cer has &s;o much percent; if they are noticed, in their way, by any other officer, not in the confedera|cy, they are carried to the Cu&s;tom|hou&s;e, and the officer gives to the &s;muggling importer that moiety of their value, that falls to his lot for &s;eizing them.&mdash;So that, admitting a ton weight of &s;uch tobacco &s;talks,
<PB N="50" REF="47">at the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e &s;ale, &s;hall fetch no more than forty pounds; twenty of this is the property of the &s;eizer, and being by him tran&s;|ferred to the &s;muggler, he gets twenty pounds for what co&s;t him perhaps le&s;s than five. Was this di&s;|covered, the officer would lo&s;e his place; but what is his place (thir|ty-five or forty pounds a year, which a man can earn at day-la|bour) in competition with the &s;ums they hazard &s;uch a place for? 'Tis the &s;ame with tea and other arti|cles; &mdash;brandy is &s;muggled in &s;mall tubs of four or five gallons each, and tea in oil&s;kin bags of fifty-&s;ix pounds weight per bag. Twenty, thirty,
<PB N="51" REF="48">or forty of the&s;e tubs or bags, are &s;trung together by cords, with &s;tones fixed to them in order to &s;ink them&mdash;thus prepared, the &s;muggler runs this boat up into a creek or river, and having no|ticed the place, by land and other marks, throws the goods over|board, where they lie concealed from &s;ight, and ready to be grap|pled up again, at a more convenient time.</P>
<P>I HAVE been at this word often, and was thought as complete a &s;muggler as any in the country. Many a time have I left Dunkirk in an open boat of three or four tons
<PB N="52" REF="49">burthen, and been off the E&s;&s;ex, Kent, or Su&s;&s;ex coa&s;ts, in the mid|dle of a dark night, waiting for &s;ig|nals from the &s;hore, to give notice for landing; but this has been when we cho&s;e to &s;ave the money to tide|waiters and Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers. &mdash;I followed this way of life a long time, but being afterwards out-law|ed, I offered my&s;elf to the &s;ociety to which I now belong, who &s;ub&s;i&s;t, in a great mea&s;ure, by warring a|gain&s;t the &s;mugglers, and as I was thought acquainted with their prac|tices, and of cour&s;e a good acqui|&s;ition, they accepted my &s;ervices, and I have been in the brotherhood the&s;e four years.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="50">ON my inquiring what he meant by being <HI>rider</HI> to a &s;muggler, he told me, that a body of daring, re|&s;olute men, were appointed by the importers to tran&s;port the articles they landed, from one town to ano|ther; that they rode in troops from &s;ixty to one hundred in number, bidding defiance to all law and op|po&s;ition; that they conveyed their tea and brandy with them openly in the face of day, each hor&s;e carry|ing his rider and three hundred pounds weight; that for this ha|zardous enterprize they were paid one guinea a week each, and &s;even &s;hillings a day travelling expences; and that it was no wonder the re|venue
<PB N="54" REF="51">&s;uffered &s;o much as two milli|ons of pounds annually, when &s;mug|gling had arrived to &s;uch a pitch, as that &s;hips of force carrying twen|ty guns, were employed to bring merchandize from Flanders, and &s;uch bodies of men were hired to covey it from place to place, when on &s;hore.</P>
<P>As we were now &s;o near the place of rendezvous, Trig had not time to let me into his hi&s;tory, but promi&s;|ed it at a future opportunity. A very &s;hort time brought us up with the company, having travelled as I conceived, about &s;even miles from the high road. They &s;eemed to be
<PB N="55" REF="52">all met, and &s;uch a &s;et of banditti I had never &s;een a&s;&s;embled before. They were &s;eated on the ground, in a ring, within a glade in the thicke&s;t part of the fore&s;t, and as a circular trench was dug out within this ring, to let down their legs as they &s;at, the ground before them &s;erved them for a table, which was rai&s;ed above the level of their &s;eats by the earth thrown out of the trench: be|fore each man were placed his wallet and his weapons of defence, a|mong which I di&s;eovered a carbine or two, two or three pair of ru&s;ty pi&s;tols, a few old cutla&s;&s;es, and each man had a bludgeon be&s;ides. On my arrival at this place, my com|panions
<PB N="56" REF="53">introduced me to the ru|ler, as one that wi&s;hed to be of the company; who&s;e honour and attach|ment (for the&s;e were their own words) they could venture to an|&s;wer for. "Gentlemen, &s;ays I," addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to the body, <Q>you &s;ee here before you, a man, who, though young in life, has &s;een e|nough of the world to be &s;ick of it; and who will be happy to find a retreat among <HI>you.</HI> I am a &s;tranger to fear, and equal to any thing con&s;i&s;tent with pru|dence. I pre&s;ume you are go|verned by &s;ome laws of your own, and you will find me a &s;trict ob&s;erver of them. What
<PB N="57" REF="54">the majority of this company dare propo&s;e, I think I dare un|dertake; and if conducted with &s;pirit, will almo&s;t an&s;wer for the event.</Q> This &s;peech &s;eemed to meet with general applau&s;e, and I took my &s;eat at the board among the re&s;t. On enquiry I found they were a parcel of villains that de&s;erv|ed a halter, and as I pa&s;&s;ed by a fic|titious name, and did not boa&s;t of greater virtue than the re&s;t, I was con&s;idered in no better light.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I was &s;eated, the ru|ler, who did not want for &s;en&s;e, ad|dre&s;&s;ed me in the following terms. <Q>You have been introduced here by
<PB N="58" REF="55">our noble and worthy friends, Nim and Trig, and I tru&s;t you are not in&s;en&s;ible of the dignity of a &s;eat among us.&mdash;Whatever opi|nion you may entertain of this company, I venture to a&s;&s;ert that we are all honourable men:&mdash; Men above any abject meanne&s;s. Like the nobles and rulers of the land, we live, indeed, by plunder, but it is the plunder of the vil|lain, and &s;uch as are enemies to the community we belong to. Is it not ju&s;t to take from the op|pre&s;&s;or, and make him refund the wages of peculation? Does not the &s;tate benefit by forfeits and e&s;cheats, by &s;ines and confi&s;cations?
<PB N="59" REF="56">And if it be lawful to take from a villain his property in any ca&s;e, it is equally lawful to do it in <HI>all</HI> ca&s;es; for nece&s;&s;ity cannot ju&s;tify a bad act. The lower a &s;coundrel is kept, the le&s;s power he has of doing harm; if, therefore, we confine our plunder and depred|ations to the griping, the u&s;urious and the lawle&s;s; far from acting wrong, we are doing what is right. We live here, my friend, &s;ecluded from a wicked world, happy in a well regulated &s;ociety; protectors of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and a terror only to the man of rapacity and the &s;muggler. If we now and then break in upon the equitable
<PB N="60" REF="57">doctrine of <HI>mine</HI> and <HI>thine,</HI> it a|ri&s;es only from an error in judg|ment, of fal&s;e information; as it frequently happens at the boards of cu&s;tom and exci&s;e, where they too frequently authorize oppre&s;&s;i|on upon fimilar pleas of excu&s;e. Often has a Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officer &s;eized a man's property, that has paid the legal duties, merely be|cau&s;e the time of the <HI>permit,</HI> by which he is allowed to remove it, has expired a few hours: and what is this better than robbing on the highway? At the wor&s;t, we act but in conformity with the re&s;t of the world, where the long|e&s;t arm ever puts in a claim for
<PB N="61" REF="58">the large&s;t &s;hare. It is the cu&s;|tom of <HI>&s;tate</HI> rulers to enrich them&s;elves at the expence of the community, and to &s;tick at nothing that will add either to their plea|&s;ure or convenience; but <HI>I</HI> di&s;|claim &s;uch conduct. I enjoy no privilegus but in common-with the re&s;t, except that of leading them on occa&s;ionally in de&s;perate adven|tures; and, as to exclu&s;ive bene|fits, I have none; nor do I wi&s;h for any. The plunder I acquire is ever &s;hared among the com|pany; more happy in having ac|quired it, than in any divi&s;ion that may fall to my &s;hare.&mdash;In &s;hort, my friend, whil&s;t you think
<PB N="62" REF="59">proper to continue with us, you will partake equally in every thing we po&s;&s;e&s;s, and if you now and then get &s;ome hard blows, you will have the &s;tatisfaction of &s;uf|fering in a noble cau&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>SUCH was our &s;uperior's introduc|tory addre&s;s to me, and it was not without its influence.</P>
<P>I AM almo&s;t a&s;hamed to own it, but I continued in this &s;ociety near two years, and gave &s;uch univer&s;al &s;atisfaction, that in three months after my joining it, I was unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en their ruler; and I per&s;uade my&s;elf from &s;ome
<PB N="63" REF="60">falutary regulations I propo&s;ed and carried, that I placed the company on a more <HI>re&s;pectable</HI> footing than it had ever been before. We acted &s;ometimes in a body, and &s;ometimes by detachments, and &s;o &s;coured the whole fore&s;t, as to keep it tolerably hone&s;t. We were at con&s;tant war with the &s;mugglers, robbed them whenever we had an opportunity, and in &s;o doing became u&s;eful mem|bers to the &s;tate. It was a rule of mine, and which I believe was inva|riably attended to, never to commit any depredations but on &s;u&s;pected people, on the griping and avariti|ous, and &s;uch per&s;ons as &s;tudied to be trouble&s;ome to us. If we had
<PB N="64" REF="61">notice of any robbery committed within the fore&s;t, we never re&s;ted till we had ferreted the villain out, or given him into the hands of ju&s;|tice; &s;o that we had often pre&s;ents for &s;uch &s;ervices; and if we were at any time charged with picking up a bag of tea, an anchor of bran|dy, a &s;traggling &s;heep, or a wild turkey, that might have been the property of a &s;muggler, a griping farmer, or the like, it was generally winked at, and thought no more than what they de&s;erved to lo&s;e. A pre&s;ent from any of the inhabitants of a toothle&s;s &s;heep, an old &s;ow, a keg of gin or beer, or a ca&s;t &s;uit of cloaths, was &s;ure to be rewarded
<PB N="65" REF="62">with protection for &s;ome months afterwards; &s;o that in fact, we had the whole fore&s;t under contribution. We lived almo&s;t in the open air: we had, indeed, two or three mud ca|bins in one part of the fore&s;t; but, in the &s;ummer, we &s;tept chiefly under hay &s;tacks, dry banks, cart-lodges, and &s;uch other &s;helter; and in win|ter, the farmers, upon a&s;king leave, would, through fear, &s;uffer us to &s;leep a night or two in their empty out-hou&s;|es or barns, and very often give us re|fre&s;hment in the morning. Before I joined the party, I believe they would occa&s;ionally take a pur&s;e upon a bye|road, (witne&s;s the attempt that was made upon me,) and would &s;ometimes
<PB N="66" REF="63">&s;tretch to other enormities; but there was no money collected during my time, except, perhaps, in the way of deceit, &s;uch as feigning di&s;tre&s;s and exciting the compa&s;&s;ion of tra|velling &s;trangers; nor, do I believe that any of the party proceeded to lengths, that would have amounted to more than a petty larceny.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP XI.</HEAD>
<P>OUR captain or ruler being the clever&s;t and be&s;t informed fel|low of the whole gang, and having a genteel carriage, I was de&s;irous of knowing his hi&s;tory; and one day when the party was upon the &s;cout, and we two left alone, at my reque&s;t, he gave me the following account of him&s;elf.</P>
<Q><PB N="68" REF="65">
<P>Who my mother was, I cannot &s;ay, but the per&s;on who called him&s;elf my father, was a &s;heriff's officer, who got pretty &s;nug|ly into life, by plundering the wretched, and preying upon the oppre&s;&s;ed. When I was at an age to remember any thing concern|ing him, he had a woman lived with him who pa&s;&s;ed for my mother-in-law; but it is a doubt with me, whether every they were married. However, be that as it may, they lived together as man and wife. The common public room of our hou&s;e, was a mi&s;er|able dungeon, under ground, cal|culated to convey an idea of horror,
<PB N="69" REF="66">that men who had lived tolerably in the world, and who on an acti|on for debt, were unfortunate enough to fall into his hands, might loath the very &s;ight of the place, and be glad to give him five &s;hil|lings a week to be admitted into a better room. We had one up|&s;tairs, that would contain twenty per&s;sons, and it was generally full at five &s;hillings a head; this with half a guinea a week, for half a bed, and two &s;hillings and &s;ix|pence a day from each, for a wretched breakfa&s;t and a wor&s;e dinner, put a con&s;iderable deal of money into my father's pocket: but this was not the only mode
<PB N="70" REF="67">he had of gaining money. She|riff's officers give &s;ecurity always for their tru&s;t, &s;o that if they &s;erve a writ, and let the pri&s;oner go at large, after he is once ar|re&s;ted, they are liable to pay the debt: 'tis on this account they will make fifty excu&s;es rather than &s;erve a writ in the pre&s;ence of the attorney or the plaintiff; but when there is no prying eye upon their conduct, they will of|ten, on receiving a pre&s;ent of a guinea or two, &s;uffer their pri|&s;oners to go and look for their bail them&s;elves; and &s;hould they, when at liberty, not keep their word, and attend the officer at
<PB N="71" REF="68">the time appointed, he will tell the paintiff or his attorney, that he never was able to meet with the defendant. In this &s;chool, the receptacle of a variety of wretch|edne&s;s, was I brought up till I was nineteen years old, and if I was born with any natural feel|ings, they were here quite eradi|cated. I was taught to load an unhappy wretch with additional mi&s;ery, and rob him of every lit|tle degree of comfort he might po&s;&s;e&s;s, in order to make him pine for relief, which relief was never afforded but at an exorbi|tant price. We had a licence for &s;elling wine; but that wine was &s;o
<PB N="72" REF="69">poor and &s;o &s;our, that it required &s;omething &s;tronger always to qua|lify it; and, if a pri&s;oner wi&s;hed to &s;end out for brandy or &s;trong beer, we always exacted as much for fetching it, as the liquor was worth. I &s;hould have continued with my father, he de&s;igning me to be one of his followers, but my mother-in-law led me &s;uch a weary life, that one day when my father was out, I opened his bureau, made free with about twenty pounds of his ill-gotten wealth, and decamped; and of cour&s;e, never dur&s;t &s;ee his face again.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="73" REF="70"><Q>I HAD &s;en&s;e enough, with the&s;e twenty pounds to equip my&s;elf with nece&s;&s;ary cloaths, and by an application to a regi&s;ter-office, got me a place; a character for which, co&s;t me no le&s;s than a guinea. As a Sheriff's officer has always bail at hand, to give &s;e|curity to an action, at a price proportionable to the debt the pri&s;oner is arre&s;ted for, &s;o the&s;e keepers of regi&s;ter-offices, have always a hou&s;e-keeper or two ready to give a character to tho&s;e who want one, and are enabled to purcha&s;e it. The price of a written character is a crown; that of a verbal one, by one of the&s;e
<PB N="74" REF="71">friends, a guinea. It was a gui|nea, however, well laid out, and I did not grudge it. It procur|ed me a place at a tea-dealer's in Bond-&s;treet, to open and &s;hut up &s;hop, carray out parcels, and do other things. My ma&s;ter, from dealing with women of fa&s;hion, had acquired a &s;moothne&s;s of tongue &s;ufficient to deceive the devil, and he found it of great u&s;e to him. If any woman came to his &s;hop in a coach, or on foot with a &s;ervant behind her, whether titled or not, &s;he was always a lady, and during her &s;tay, the word <HI>lady&s;hip</HI> was &s;el|dom out of his mouth. He
<PB N="75" REF="72">would &s;tand all day dre&s;&s;ed at his &s;hop door, when he had no cu&s;tomers within, and bow to every carriage that pa&s;&s;ed; and whil&s;t he was at dinner, he ex|pected me to be dre&s;&s;ed, and to bow for him.</Q> <Q>Why didn't you bow to that coach,</Q> <Q>&s;aid he to me, one day warmly?

She took it to the light, &s;melt it, ta&s;ted it, rubbed it in the palm of her hand, &s;melt it again, and enquired if he had no better; he a&s;&s;ured her lady&s;hip, there was no better to be bounght, and perhaps he &s;poke the truth; for all tea-dealers mix their teas, as wine merchants adulterate their wine and &s;pirits. They make Hy&s;on of all prices, from ten &s;hillings to eighteen, by mixing it with what is called <HI>Bloom,</HI> or common green; then
<PB N="77" REF="76">again they dye it and &s;cent it; a few drops of Bergamot, &amp;c. thrown into a pound of Souchong, is &s;old for Cow&s;lip, or a tea of a &s;uperior nature; and as I general|ly had a hand in the&s;e adultera|tions, I can take upon me to &s;ay, I believe the tea my ma&s;ter &s;hewed this lady, was as genuine as any &s;he could have met with. But, it would not do;</Q> <Q>Better,</Q> <Q>&s;ays &s;he,</Q> <Q>Mr. Congo, is cer|tainly to be bought, for I drink better every day, though 'tis true I give more money for it. If you have no better, I am &s;orry for the trouble I have given you.</Q> <Q>On her leaving the &s;hop, he re|plied,</Q>
<Q><PB N="78" REF="77">if your lady&s;hip does not object to price, I have a peculiar kind at thirty-&s;ix &s;hillings a pound, which I defy the whole town to equal.</Q> <Q>Thirty-&s;ix &s;hillings!</Q> <Q>exclaimed &s;he, returning,</Q> <Q>I ne|ver heard of &s;uch a price,&mdash;it mu&s;t be a curio&s;ity!&mdash;Pray let me &s;ee it.</Q> <Q>He then reached down another canni&s;ter of the &s;ame tea, and &s;he, examining it with &s;ome attention, cries,</Q> <Q>this to be &s;ure is con&s;iderably better; but the price amazes me.&mdash;Why did'nt you &s;hew me this at fir&s;t?

<PB N="79" REF="78">pay thirty-&s;ix &s;hillings a pound for tea, which &s;he might have had for eighteen. But 'tis the way with the&s;e ladies; not knowing the value or price of commodities, they are taken in by almo&s;t every trade&s;man they deal with. So that with all the parade of prying, looking over, examining, enquiring, cheapen|ing, and &s;o on, they will give fifty per cent more than other people. Knowing nothing beyond the line of life they are in, they rate the goodne&s;s of every thing by its price, and conceive a low|priced article to be nought but tra&s;h. Goods within their knowledge,
<PB N="80" REF="79">they will go far a-foot to pur|cha&s;e. City traders unu&s;ed to deal with &s;uch per&s;ons, will not often take advantage of their ig|norance. They will not a&s;k fifteen &s;hillings for a pur&s;e at a coach door, which they will &s;ell for half the money to a cu&s;tomer on foot. There are &s;ome ladies &s;hrewd enough to know this; and yet the&s;e, in&s;tead of going in their own carriage, will pay four &s;hillings for a hackney coach, to &s;ave two-pence a yard on a dozen yards of ribband. In a word, they owe all this to their pride, their vanity and parade; they will go a <HI>&s;hopping</HI> as they
<PB N="81" REF="80">call it, morning after morning, tumble over a great variety of goods, give a great deal of trou|ble, and not buy; and often when they <HI>do</HI> buy, they will not <HI>pay</HI> for years. Were per&s;ons of fortune to act con&s;i&s;tently, they would &s;oon find their account in it; but whil&s;t they go on as they do, they mu&s;t not be &s;ur|pri&s;ed at any thing they meet with.</Q></P>

<Q><P>I SHOULD have continued with Mr. Congo longer, but I happen|ed one day, to let the cat out of the bag, by telling my ma&s;ter, in|advertently before the exci&s;eman, who happened to be in the &s;hop, that a bag of tea which he had &s;towed away in the cellar, was bur&s;t, and a good deal of the tea &s;hed.

<PB N="84" REF="83">goods from the in&s;pection of the exci&s;eman, and this idle expre&s;|&s;ion of mine, not only co&s;t him a &s;ilencing fee of twenty guineas to &s;teer clear of the Exchequer, but it lo&s;t me my place.</P>
<P>I APPLIED again to a regi&s;ter-office, and was next in the &s;ervice of Mr. Porcelain, a chinaman in St. James's Street. This ma&s;ter, like my la&s;t, had little to do but with women of fa&s;hion, and gave me an opportunity of &s;eeing a little more of their folly. He had originally been a Welch drover, was a man of low cunning, and where he picked up his know|ledge
<PB N="85" REF="84">in china, I know not, but he was reckoned, a connoi&s;&s;eur, and became the &s;tandard of ta&s;te in this branch of trade. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mo&s;t beautiful and valuable collection in town, his &s;hop was the morning &s;aunter of tho&s;eladies who&s;e fancy took that turn. His mode of keeping up this collecti|on, was by culling the china clo|&s;ets of women of quality in a very artful and de&s;igning way. His plan was to find out what ladies had the be&s;t collection, and when|ever they came to his &s;hop, he gave them to under&s;tand, that he took china in exchange, and po&s;|&s;ibly they might have a few odd
<PB N="86" REF="85">articles, of little value to them, but which when a&s;&s;orted with other pieces, which he might find among&s;t his lumber, might be worth &s;omething. This general|ly procured him acce&s;s to the clo|&s;et: be&s;ides, there are few collec|tors of china, but (like collect|ors of natural curio&s;ities) are fond of di&s;playing their collections be|fore tho&s;e who are e&s;teemed virtu|o&s;os.</P></Q>
<P><Q>HE was one day in lady Betty Soft's clo&s;et, when a pair of old va&s;es of uncommon beauty &s;truck him. But, he was &s;ilent. She &s;hewed him every thing in turn;
<PB N="87" REF="86">and a&s;ked his opinion of it. He did not fail to prai&s;e mo&s;t things of little value, and depreciate many of intrin&s;ic worth; but declared he had not &s;een upon the whole a more valuable collection any where, and that her Lady&s;hip, &s;hewed her&s;elf a woman of un|common ta&s;te. There was no|thing, he &s;aid, throughout the clo&s;et, that arraigned that ta&s;te, but tho&s;e vulgar va&s;es in the cor|ner, which he would advi&s;e her lady&s;hip to put upon the mantle|piece in her nur&s;ery.</Q> <Q>Nur|&s;ery,</Q> &s;ays &s;he, <Q>Mr. Porcelain? they will &s;oon be of no value there, and they co&s;t me a great
<PB N="88" REF="87">deal of money.</Q> <Q>Then your lady&s;hip was impo&s;ed on, returned he.</Q> <Q><HI>You</HI> had better take them then,</Q> replied lady Betty, <Q>with the&s;e odd articles we have picked out.</Q> <Q>They were of little worth</Q> he &s;aid, <Q>by them&s;elves but along with other things, he would allow her lady&s;hip &s;omething for them. He accordingly took them away with him; and was no &s;ooner gone, than her lady&s;hip's maid was rung for, and made acquainted with the bu&s;ine&s;s of the morning.</Q> <Q>Porcelain, the china-man,</Q> &s;ays &s;he, <Q>has been here, and tho&s;e va|&s;es, which you and others have &s;o much admired, I find are trum|pery

<PB N="90" REF="89">me to carry them up to the top of the hou&s;e; and on being told the man's errand,</Q> <Q>cri|ed out, how very unfortunate! I had no &s;ooner brought them and &s;et them down upon my counter, but a gentleman, who came in at that in&s;tand, a&s;ked the price of that ordinary pair of va&s;es, and I have &s;old them to him for a &s;ong.</Q> <Q>Run, Will,</Q> &s;ays he, to me, <Q>down that &s;treet, you may po&s;&s;ibly overtake him&mdash;in a &s;carlet gold-laced wai&s;t|coat&mdash;he has not been out of the &s;hop five minutes.</Q> <Q>I &s;et off as he ordered me&mdash;but the va&s;es were irrecoverable. And three months afterwards, with &s;ome ad|ditional
<PB N="91" REF="90">painted ornaments to di&s;|gui&s;e them, they added to his &s;tock of china, and were rated as antiques.</Q></P>
<Q>ON my &s;miling at the idea of his painting it a-fre&s;h, he told me, it was a practice with him. He had been known to &s;ell a whole &s;ervice of white china painted and varni&s;hed over, for that which is burnt in, and when a dinner has been &s;erved up in it, the &s;team of the di&s;hes has obliterated the painting, and all the figures have vani&s;hed.</Q>
<P><PB N="92" REF="91"><Q>He u&s;ed to &s;urvey his cu&s;tom|ers from head to foot, and a&s;k a price according to their appear|ance.</Q> <Q>What &s;hall I give you,</Q> &s;ays a lady, one day, to him <Q>for that &s;et of Dre&s;den china?</Q> <Q>It was Chel&s;ea, but as &s;he took it for <HI>Dre&s;den,</HI> he a&s;ked a <HI>Dre&s;den</HI> price, (twenty guineas) and it was pur|cha&s;ed.

The bargain was &s;truck, the jars put into the coach, and her lady&s;hip no &s;ooner from the door, than he turned round to me, hugging

<P><Q>THIS puts me in mind of a &s;tory, I have &s;ome where met with.

<P><Q>SUCH a man was my &s;econd ma&s;ter; and you may &s;uppo&s;e, that under the roof of two &s;uch art|ful in&s;tructors, I mu&s;t certainly have improved. I learned a good deal before I left home; but ac|quired a further degree of know|ledge under Mr. Congo and Mr. Porcelain. I fell in &s;o much with my ma&s;ter's natural di&s;po|&s;ition, that he began to like me; but an accident here al&s;o deprived me of my place. Our &s;hop was &s;eldom kept open after five
<PB N="97" REF="98">o'clock, &s;o that I had a good deal of time upon my hands;&mdash;&s;ome of my evenings I, u&s;ed to &s;pend at a &s;pouting club in the neighbour|hood; where, though a very bad &s;peaker, I got &s;uch a rage for de|clamation, that I was always re|peating &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages or other, whenever I, had opportunity. When I &s;pent my evenings at home, I u&s;ed to entertain the maids with my theatrical abilities. One of the&s;e, Su&s;an, a &s;imple country wench, was mightily taken with my &s;peeches. I have ranted away Hot&s;pur, till &s;he has, with her mouth open, been as &s;tiff, and as motionle&s;s as a &s;tatue. But one
<PB N="98" REF="99">evening, when I was in &s;pirits, I gave them a few pa&s;&s;ages out of Alexander the Great, and I had worked my&s;elf up to &s;uch a pitch, in the &s;cene with Clytus, that when I was to kill him, in a pa|roxi&s;m of rage, I kicked down the table, forgetting that my ma&s;ter was overhead. This made &s;uch a clatter, that the bell was rung, and, Su&s;an went up, &s;carce recover|ed from that frigidity of horror, my murderous tongue at fir&s;t had thrown her into.</Q> <Q>What's all that d&mdash;mned racked below?</Q> &s;ays my ma&s;ter&mdash; <Q>Nothing, Sir,</Q> &s;ays &s;he, <Q>but Alexander has ju&s;t killed Cly|phus.</Q> <Q>If he goes on in this

<P>I GAVE him to under&s;tand that i was quite entertained with his manner of telling his &s;tory, as it fell in with my notions, that of making remarks on life as I pa&s;&s;ed along, and begged him to proceed.</P>
<P>HE replied, <Q>from what he could learn from his acquaintance who were in the &s;ervice of o|thers, that trade&s;men, &s;how their
<PB N="100" REF="101">wor&s;t goods and olde&s;t patterns fir&s;t, particularly &s;ilk-mercers, linen and woollen-drapers, haberda&s;hers, and the like; that they have particular lights in their &s;hops to give them a fal&s;e appearance; that they pretend to examine the goods narrowly, to make the buyer &s;uppo&s;e they would not deceive him, a&s;k more than the thing is worth to allow for a|bating, crib a little in the quantity or mea&s;ure, and then reach their &s;cales to weight the money they re|ceive. In &s;hort, that there is not a trade or profe&s;&s;ion but what has its my&s;teries and arts of defrauding; that men open their &s;hops, &s;et out their goods every morning to im|po&s;e
<PB N="101" REF="102">upon their cu&s;tomers, and chearfully &s;hut them up again at night, after having cheated all the day, like the woman who after talking all the &s;candal &s;he can, wipes her mouth and &s;ays &s;he has done no harm.</Q></P>
<P><Q>SINCE then,</Q> continued he, <Q>as whatever is, is right, and the&s;e men with whom I had lived were doing &s;o well in the world by a little artifice and fine&s;&s;e, I was un|happy I could not &s;trike out into &s;ome way of life my&s;elf that would rai&s;e me above the &s;ituation of a &s;ervant.

<HEAD>CHAP XII.</HEAD>
<P><Q>I PRESENTLY,</Q> continued he, <Q>got another place, which was to wait upon a young gentleman, who lived upon an allowance from his father. The old man, was a widower, had been very low bred, but was fortunately in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a good e&s;tate, which he &s;quandered away in a very
<PB N="104" REF="105">extraordinary manner. He was immoderately fond of farming, and fancied he had a talent, which few men po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, that of im|proving land to the highe&s;t de|gree of luxuriancy. He was of opinion, that, of all men, he who made two blades of gra&s;s grow, where only one grew before, was the mo&s;t u&s;eful in &s;ociety. Under this idea, he took farms in mo&s;t parts of the kingdom, though he had not &s;ufficient to &s;tock them; he neither ploughed nor &s;owed, but laid down all the land he could in gra&s;s, and what he could not lay down properly, he &s;uffered na|ture to lay down for him with
<PB N="105" REF="106">&s;cutch gra&s;s, thi&s;tles and docks. Though he was a &s;en&s;ible and &s;hrewd man in other re&s;pects, he was a madman in farming, and would almo&s;t deprive him&s;elf of nece&s;&s;aries, to lay it out upon land, which yielded him little or no re|turn. The fine&s;t crops of gra&s;s and clover he has &s;uffered to rot on the ground; under a notion of feeding the land. Nay, he has been known to &s;ow his gra&s;s lands with carrot and turnip &s;eed, and on being a&s;ked his rea&s;on for it;</Q> replied, <Q>gra&s;s land could not be too full of &s;eeds.</Q> <Q>He has filled a barn with potatoes, wa&s;hed and piled away at a great expence,
<PB N="106" REF="107">and &s;uffered them to &s;tand there and grow through the thatch. I mention all this, to convince you there could be no harm in robbing &s;uch a man, for the &s;ake of his &s;on, whom he had brought up a gentleman, and whom, whil&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a large fortune, he would &s;carce allow &s;ufficient to exi&s;t on. I really pitied my young ma&s;ter, who was an only child, from my heart, and u&s;ed to plead his cau&s;e with the old gentle|man often, but could &s;eldom ex|tort any thing from him. How|ever, one day, when I had been about a year in the family, I con|trived to get a little of his ca&s;h:
<PB N="107" REF="108">he had ju&s;t received a debt of four hundred pounds, and was coming into the room where I and my ma&s;ter were.&mdash;I gave my ma&s;ter the wink and he left us; and the old gentleman, having the bag in his hand, &s;hut to the door; but did not &s;ee that I was in the room.</Q> <Q>This is a &s;trange age we live in,</Q> &s;aid he to him&s;elf, <Q>I know not what to make of it. Never was there a greater fondne&s;s for money, nor &s;o much difficulty in getting one's own. Debts now-a-days, are like children, begot with plea&s;ure, but brought forth with pain; however I have no need to complain, hav|ing ju&s;t received four hundred
<PB N="108" REF="109">pounds, that has been owing to me two years, and it will go a great way towards &s;tocking Littlecot farm.&mdash;So, Mr. Ra&s;cal,</Q> continues he, &s;eeing me and hurrying the bag into his coat-pocket!&mdash;<Q>Ra&s;cal, Sir!</Q> returns I, <Q>I am &s;ure I dont de&s;erve that name.</Q> <Q>Yes, ra&s;cal,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>you are the ruin of my &s;on. You may tell him I am very angry with him.</Q> <Q>With my ma&s;ter, Sir?</Q> replies I, <Q>In|deed, you are not the only one who complains of him; his con|duct is grown &s;o abominable of late, that it drives <HI>me</HI> beyond all patience.</Q> <Q>Indeed!</Q> &s;ays the old man, <Q>why, I thought you and he
<PB N="109" REF="110">were perfectly agreed.</Q> <Q>Me, Sir?</Q> returns I, affecting unhappine&s;s at his &s;on's conduct, <Q>far from it; I preach to him too much, for that; I am &s;ure, I am always put|ting him in mind of the duty he owes to you and to him&s;elf. Why, we are every moment at daggers drawing.&mdash;He can't bear I &s;hould tell him how ill he be|haves to you.</Q> <Q>And do you quar|rel with him for this?</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>That I do, and pretty hand&s;ome|ly too,</Q> returned I. <Q>I have been under a great mi&s;take then,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>for I always under&s;tood that you encouraged him in his extra|vagance and di&s;obedience.</Q> <Q>Ah,

<PB N="111" REF="112">pocket of the bag; but not &s;uc|ceeding, I went on.</Q>&mdash; <Q>And no longer break his poor heart with your behaviour, but take up and live as he does with reputation and honour.</Q> <Q>Here I made another attempt and &s;ucceeded.</Q> <Q>Why, that was well &s;aid,</Q> replied the old gentleman. <Q>And what an&s;wer does he make?</Q> <Q>An&s;wer?</Q> &s;ays I, <Q>A pack of &s;tuff that almo&s;t makes me mad; not, but to &s;ay the truth, he retains in his heart the &s;eeds of honour and virtue, you have there &s;own.

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<Q><P>WITH this fifty pounds I determined to &s;et up for my&s;elf, accordingly I quitted my place, and hearing of an orphan young lady of &s;eventeen years of age, who was heire&s;s to a fortune of &s;ix thou&s;and a year, one thou|&s;and of which &s;he enjoyed dur|her minority, and who lived with
<PB N="125" REF="126">an aunt at the we&s;t end of the town; I determined to make a bold pu&s;h, and try if I could not carry her; with this view I e|quipped my&s;elf with a &s;uit or two of genteel cloaths, and pa&s;&s;ed for a gentleman. Having found out the hou&s;e where &s;he lived, I fre|quently walked under the win|dow, with the hopes of &s;eeing her, and, at la&s;t I &s;aw one whom I took to be her, and &s;he was as pretty, as &s;he was rich. My next &s;tep was, if po&s;&s;ible, to get acce&s;s to her. For this purpo&s;e, I went to a public-hou&s;e in the neighbourhood, addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to a chairman I there found, and
<PB N="126" REF="127">made many enquiries re&s;pecting the family, particularly where they vi&s;ited, and where they re|&s;ided in the country: all this I learnt; this done, I contrived to get to the ear of &s;ome of the &s;er|vants, which I likewi&s;e effected. The chairman to whom I fir&s;t ap|plied, told me, that the footman and coachman u&s;ed that hou&s;e, and were generally there in an evening between tea-time and &s;up|per. At this hour I went, and was introduced to them. I took the footman apart, gave him to under&s;tand I was a gentleman and a man of family and fortune; that accident had thrown me into
<PB N="127" REF="128">the way of his young mi&s;tre&s;s and I wi&s;hed to be better acquainted with her; and if he would a&s;&s;i&s;t me in &s;o doing, I would endea|vour to be his friend, and as an earne&s;t of that friend&s;hip I tipped him half a guinea: he promi&s;ed me all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his power, and told me, that both &s;he and her aunt were to be at the play the next day, having a couple of box tickets for a benefit. This intelligence was every thing I could wi&s;h. I was at the theatre the &s;ame night, procured admi&s;|&s;ion into the &s;ame box, and had the happine&s;s to be particularly noticed by her; for I &s;et clo&s;e by
<PB N="128" REF="129">her &s;ide. When the play was over, I handed her to her carri|age, and politely took my leave. The day following, I found out the footman again, and made enquiries re&s;pecting the lady's maid. He a&s;&s;ured me, &s;he was an open-hearted girl, and did not doubt, but &s;he would favour my views. I wi&s;hed very much to &s;ee her; and he promi&s;ed to a&s;k her to give me a meeting. An opportuni|ty &s;oon occurred for that purpo&s;e; the footman brought me word the next day, that his young mi&s;tre&s;s and her aunt, went out an airing every morning about twelve, and that if I would go to the hou&s;e in their ab&s;ence, he had made
<PB N="129" REF="130">their porter acquainted with my wi&s;hes, and he would let Mi&s;s's maid know when I was there. I took the fir&s;t opportunity of go|ing, and &s;aw the coach drive from the door. A tete-a-tete &s;oon took place between me and the maid, whom I made al&s;o my friend by a pre&s;ent of five guineas. She promi&s;ed to plead my cau&s;e with her young mi&s;tre&s;s, and did it effectually. An interview was appointed, and I was to meet her in Ken&s;ington Gardens. On the day fixed, &s;he promi&s;ed to be there with her maid, who, on my com|ing up, retired. I had now an op|portunity of pre&s;&s;ing my &s;uit, and I did it with as much warmth, as if
<PB N="130" REF="131">I had been really in love. I told her a thou&s;and lies &s;o pa&s;&s;ionate|ly, that the poor little credulous thing believed them all, and at parting promi&s;ed to meet me again the fir&s;t opportunity. The ice being now broken, through the means of this &s;ervant, we carried on a corre&s;pondence for near a month, when I was given to under&s;tand, that the family was retiring to their &s;eat in Hamp|&s;hire."</P>
<P>THIS bu&s;ine&s;s was expen&s;ive, but thinking my&s;elf &s;ure of my prize, I obtained goods upon cre|dit, and pawned them as &s;oon as
<PB N="131" REF="132">delivered; by this means, I was enabled to keep up appearances. I followed Mi&s;s into the country, where under a pretence of tak|ing a walk, I had frequent op|portunities of being with her, un|noticed by her aunt. The &s;er|vants I took care to keep in my intere&s;t. She agreed at la&s;t to give me her hand, and it was propo&s;ed that we &s;hould &s;et off for Scotland, and that her maid &s;hould accompany us. Having thus brought things to a cri|&s;is; and finding &s;he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome very valuable diamonds, I advi&s;ed her by all means to take tho&s;e with her, as &s;he could not
<PB N="132" REF="133">think of returning home, and it was impo&s;&s;ible to make a proper appearance without them: &s;he acquie&s;ced with this propo&s;al, and the day was fixed for her elopement; but as the devil would have it, and accident hap|pened that overthrew all I had been about.</P></Q>
<P><Q>THERE being at the hou&s;e I was at, an evening club, where the neighbours u&s;ed to meet, &s;moke their pipes and fettle the affairs of admini&s;tration; having been ad|mitted among them, I pa&s;&s;ed my time rather agreeably than other|wi&s;e. One of the party was an
<PB N="133" REF="134">elderly trade&s;man, lately married to a &s;mart young woman, whom I had once or twice &s;een, and was much taken with; but he was &s;o much under petticoat government, that &s;he u&s;ed to fetch him home at night at a regular hour. He had been often rallied on this head, and was &s;o greatly a&s;hamed of it, that, under a promi&s;e not to &s;tay longer than eleven, &s;he agreed to go to bed before him. Like other babblers, who often lay open their own affairs una&s;ked, and frequently to their prejudice; he gave us to under&s;tand, &s;he was too jealous to &s;uffer the maid to fit up for
<PB N="134" REF="135">him, and that as the door would not unlock on the out&s;ide, it was left upon the latch. On being a&s;ked whether &s;he left a light.</Q> <Q>A light?</Q> Says he, <Q>no.&mdash;Our hou&s;e is not &s;o large, but I can find my way up into my room without a light; we lay but on the one pair of &s;tairs, over the &s;hop.</Q> <Q>I was determined he &s;hould one day pay dear for this communication, and concerted it with the re&s;t of the company, to keep him from home beyond his u&s;ual hour, to &s;ee whether his wife would come the next night to fetch him. Accordingly, in the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation, talk|ing
<PB N="135" REF="136">of the uxoriou&s;ne&s;s of hu&s;|bands, I put my gentleman upon the metal, and offered to lay him a bet of two guineas, that he dur&s;t not &s;tay out that night till half after twelve. From an opi|nion that his wife would be a&s;leep, and not know the hour of his return, he took the bet, and when the clock &s;truck eleven, was exceeding good company. About twenty minutes after, I took a French leave, went over to his hou&s;e, lifted the latch, and without much difficulty, found my way into the chamber over the &s;hop. All was quiet, and the fair one a&s;leep. Having un|dre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="136" REF="137">my&s;elf at the &s;tair head without the door, I &s;tole into the room, and the reader may &s;uppo&s;e I was not long before I was between the &s;heets. I had but little time, and was deter|mined to make the be&s;t u&s;e of it. She &s;oon waked and &s;poke to me, but found me not di&s;po&s;ed to an&s;wer. However, whether &s;he was able in the dark, to di&s;tin|gui&s;h between her hu&s;band and me, or any way di&s;covered the cheat, I know not; but this I know, &s;he was as kind to me as I could wi&s;h.&mdash;When I found her compo&s;ed, I began to retire, but &s;he &s;oon mi&s;&s;ed me from the
<PB N="137" REF="138">bed, and hearing me fumbling at the door, and I not an&s;wering her when &s;he &s;poke, &s;u&s;pecting I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;ome trick had been played her, &s;he ro&s;e with great anger, &s;eized me by the arm be|fore I could get away, alarmed the hou&s;e, and I was unfortun|ately di&s;covered. I was how|ever, &s;uffered to dre&s;s my&s;elf and return to my quarters.</Q></P>
<Q><P>THIS affair made a great noi&s;e in the village, and pre&s;ently reach|ed the man&s;ion. The young lady I was to accompany to Scotland, took offence at my conduct; and I could never get to &s;ee her a|gain.
<PB N="138" REF="139">Other rea&s;ons might co-operate again&s;t me, but I could not learn what they were. I wrote one or two letters to her, but all to no purpo&s;e. The family pre&s;ently left the country, and I heard of her no more: it was a <HI>fortunate</HI> event for her, but a d&mdash;n'd <HI>unlucky</HI> one for me.</P>
<P>The injured hu&s;band deter|mined to pro&s;ecute me for violat|ing the honour of hs wife; but the lawyers could not well advi&s;e him how to proceed. Some pro|po&s;ed indicting me capitally for <HI>Burglary;</HI> lifting a latch and en|tering
<PB N="139" REF="140">a dwelling hou&s;e by night, if done with a felonious intent, being a &s;pecies of that crime; but as the wife was con&s;ent|ing to the act it could not be <HI>felony,</HI> of cour&s;e, not burglary. The &s;ame argument prevented its being deemed a <HI>rape.</HI> Others were for indicting me for <HI>grand larcency</HI> or <HI>&s;tealing privately from the per&s;on;</HI> but what did I &s;teal? Nothing but her con&s;ent. This not being any thing that could in fact be carried away, the idea of proceeding on that &s;tatute fell to the ground. <HI>Actions of tre&s;pa&s;s, &s;eduction,</HI> &amp;c. were then propo&s;ed;
<PB N="140" REF="141">but the whole centered at la&s;t in a pro&s;ecution for <HI>crim. con.</HI></P>
<P>BUT this being more than I could &s;tand, I thought it better to decamp; and wi&s;hing, as you did, to hide my&s;elf for a while, I made a propo&s;al to this company to join them, and they admitted me among them.</P></Q>
<P>IN this &s;avage &s;tate, though I could boa&s;t of few indulgencies, the life I led was orderly, and free from embarra&s;&s;ments. There was a &s;trict di&s;cipline kept up among us, and a dread of being impeached
<PB N="141" REF="142">kept the unruly in awe; for had an information been laid by any indi|vidual of the gang again&s;t his com|rades, the neighbouring magi&s;trates would never have noticed it; where|as an impeachment by the whole gang of any individual, would have been &s;ufficient to have called out a warrant again&s;t him; &s;o much was our company con&s;idered as a nece&s;|&s;ary evil. At our general meetings, each of us, by turns, was the cook for the day, till the la&s;t year of my time, when we took in three young women among us, one of whom, by the general voice, as ruler, was to be &s;acred to me, and the other two were in common among us all.
<PB N="142" REF="143">They all proved pregnant before I quitted the company, and though I did not continue long enough to &s;ee how they got over the difficulty, I under&s;tood they meant either to drop their ba&s;tards in &s;ome di&s;tant pari&s;h, lay them at the doors of &s;ome gen|tlemen's hou&s;es, or &s;wear them to per&s;ons that had been their common di&s;turbers. However, as I doubted the fidelity of <HI>my</HI> lady, I was not very unea&s;y about what became of her burthen. An event happened that determined me to quit the con|nexion, and when it took place I left my right in her to my &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="144">INFORMATION had been given us, that in a part of the fore&s;t, conceal|ed under ground, a body of &s;mug|glers had &s;towed a con&s;iderable quantity of brandy and other things; we found it out, and the booty con|&s;i&s;ted of 300 anchors of brandy, 200 half anchors of gin, and 25 bags of tea, containing 50 lb. each. This being lodged at a neighbouring cu&s;|tom hou&s;e, it was condemned and &s;olf, and our part of the money a|mounted to 540 l. which, &s;hared among eighteen was 30l. a man: thinking I &s;hould never meet with a better opportunity of equipping my|&s;elf for a more re&s;pectable employ, when in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ca&s;h, I took
<PB N="144" REF="145">a French leave of my companions, and never have heard any thing of them &s;ince.</P>
<P>It was in the &s;ummer time when I quitted the fore&s;t, and the fir&s;t place I retired to was Lymington, where I &s;taid long enough to get my&s;elf new dre&s;&s;ed. It is almo&s;t inconceivable to think how I la|boured to reconcile my pa&s;t conduct with what is equitable and right. I have often thought, that it is with diffioulty that men who have been brought up religiou&s;ly, and with liberal notions, fall away from an hone&s;t cour&s;e of life; I felt my&s;elf hurt at that I was ju&s;t emerged
<PB N="145" REF="146">from, and endeavoured to convince my&s;elf, that I was not &s;o bad, as the world may &s;uppo&s;e me, from the account I have here given. I began with reflecting, that fear had driven me from one &s;ociety, and that like a hunted animal I took &s;helter in the fir&s;t place that offered: that I no &s;ooner became a member of the com|pany I have de&s;cribed, but I la|boured to reclaim them, and flatter my&s;elf that I in a great mea&s;ure &s;ucceeded; from villains of the fir&s;t denomination, I reduced them to &s;coundrels of the &s;econd, made them rather &s;erviceable to the community than otherwi&s;e, and had they fol|lowed the example I pointed out by
<PB N="146" REF="147">my own conduct, they might have &s;eparated and become hone&s;t men: I con&s;idered that unlike bad &s;tate&s;|men, bad citizens of every cla&s;s, who are a &s;courge to all men, we only were a &s;courge to the obnox|ious; and that if the nece&s;&s;ities of a &s;tate can authorize and render eqi|table the general plunder of our enemy, both by &s;ea and land, we did no more, though in a narrower &s;cale; we plundered only the ene|mies of the Cu&s;toms, of the fair dealer, and of &s;ociety. In a word, if I acted wrong, or an unequi|table part in life, I took the fir&s;t opportunity to relinqui&s;h it, and I
<PB N="147" REF="148">wi&s;h every one could lay their hand upon their heart and &s;ay the &s;ame.</P>
<P>I will fini&s;h this chapter with a &s;triking anecdote on the &s;ubject. A merchant of London was &s;topped on the highway by a man whom he &s;oon di&s;covered to have been once his &s;ervant.

<P>IN this great length of time, it may naturally be expected, that I &s;hould have thought &s;omething of Mi&s;s Wildman, and have been anxi|ous to have known the determina|tion of the jury, re&s;pecting the death of the man I &s;hot, if I really <HI>had</HI> killed him; but, as in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t chapter, I was unwilling

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR MISS WILDMAN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am &s;till in the land of the liv|ing, in good health, and in as good &s;piritis, as &s;o long an ab&s;ence from you will admit of; your ring, that pledge of your con&s;tancy, has never been off my finger; of cour&s;e, you have never been out of my mind. A fear of embarra&s;&s;ments, in con&s;e|quence of the event, on the even|ing of the day I la&s;t &s;aw you, drove me from London, and indeed has &s;o far driven me from the world, that I am totally, ignorant of its re&s;ult;
<PB N="153" REF="154">and of cour&s;e, it keeps me &s;till at a di&s;tance from you. I would be more particular in this letter, was I &s;ure it would fall into no other hands but yours; but, till I am convinced of this, expect nothing from me, but an a&s;&s;urance of the continuance of that affection, I have &s;o many times profe&s;&s;ed.</P>

<P><PB N="154" REF="155">
I WENT over to Southampton purpo&s;ely to put this letter into the po&s;t; and a fortnight after, when I had rea&s;on to expect an an&s;wer, I &s;ent frequently to Sali&s;|bury to enquire for any letter &s;o addre&s;&s;ed, and was every time di&s;appointed; &s;o that I concluded, it mu&s;t either have been intercepted, or that &s;he had proved unfaithful; the la&s;t I was unwilling to &s;uppo&s;e, but till I had an opportunity of making &s;ome enquiries, I gave up the idea of writing again.</P>
<P>HAVING dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf anew, and my hair being grown to its u&s;ual length; I called my&s;elf <HI>Henry
<PB N="155" REF="156">Savage,</HI> alluding to the life I had lately led, and was ready again for any employ I could procure. On my informing the taylor who made my cloaths, that I wi&s;hed for a place; he told me, that Dr. Bolus, a phy&s;ician at Sali&s;bury, wanted a &s;ervant, and that he thought I &s;hould &s;uit him. I accordingly, with the taylor's recommendation, applied to this gentleman, and was taken into his family as a footman. This ma&s;ter of mine, this &s;on of E&s;culapius, had not been regularly bred as a phy&s;ician, but &s;erved his time as an apothecary in the north of England. Having, however, failed as a di&s;pen&s;er of drugs, and
<PB N="156" REF="157">finding an opening in this city, by the death of Dr. <HI>Kill'em,</HI> who had practiced here thirty years; he writes down to a friend at Gla&s;gow, with a remittance of twenty guineas; and a diploma, for de&s;troying man|kind <HI>&s;ecundum artem</HI> was immedi|ately di&s;patched by the &s;tage coach. With this faculty of poi&s;oning his Maje&s;ty's liege &s;ubjects, he &s;ets up for a phy&s;ician at Sali&s;bury, and en|deavoured to acquire practice, not by any medical abilities, but by art and fine&s;&s;ed. All this I gathered be|fore I had been with him a fort|night. He was a little man, about fifty years of age; wore a pair of &s;quare-toed &s;hoes, his &s;tockings rol|led
<PB N="157" REF="158">over his knees, a full trimmed coat with long &s;kirts, and a full bottomed wig that reached to his rump; &s;o different was he accoutred from the phy&s;icians of the pre&s;ent age, that you would &s;uppo&s;e him to have ri&s;en from the tombs. In &s;hort, he was no <HI>body,</HI> for he was all wig and &s;kirts, and in fact &s;uch a piece of affectation, that I wonder|ed any one employed him. But, he had withal a great deal of world|ly cunning: and, in a communica|tive mood, one day told me, phy|&s;ic was a farce, and that it was a&s;to|ni&s;hing the people were &s;o taken in by it; that nature always did be&s;t when left to her&s;elf, and that a pa|tient
<PB N="158" REF="159">mu&s;t be very ad indeed, to be in danger of dying, except when a phy&s;ician is called in; that there are but three or four principal medicines in the whole <HI>materia medica</HI> of any real efficacy, and who&s;e virtue al|mo&s;t every old woman is acquaint|ed with; that a good tongue is of more u&s;e to a man in this profe&s;&s;ion, than all the learning of the ho&s;pi|tals; that illne&s;s, in general, &s;o af|fect the &s;pirits, that a &s;ick per&s;on may be almo&s;t per&s;uaded to any thing, and that if a man knows but the art of concealing his ignorance, he may pa&s;s for one of the fir&s;t rate abilities. <Q>Often have I given in fevers,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>too &s;trong
<PB N="159" REF="160">a cathartic potion for the con|&s;titution of my patient, &s;o as to excoriate his bowels and make him void blood; and having af|terwards brought him round a|gain by emollients, he has attri|buted his cure to &s;uch &s;uperna|tural avoidance, when in fact it has gone near to kill him; and from the &s;ame rea&s;oning, I often dread, that when I treat a di&s;or|der right, where it fails of &s;uc|ce&s;s, I may be cen&s;ured for my conduct; for, as when I have act|ed wrong, an ignorant patient has &s;uppo&s;ed it right; I may be conceived to have proceeded ill,
<PB N="160" REF="161">when in fact I have done the be&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><Q>WHAT all the world &s;ays mu&s;t be true,</Q> is an old proverb, and the general opinion of practitioners in phy&s;ic concurring in this point, is a corroboration of the fact. The following circum&s;tance did not a little &s;trengthen me in this conceit. Having been &s;ent to a neighbouring apothe|cary for a medicine that had been ordered; the ma&s;ter, who had left his boy in the &s;hop to make it up, com|ing out of a back room, and going behind the counter to &s;ee if it was fini&s;hed, flew in a violent pa&s;&s;ion, and gave the boy a box on the ear,
<PB N="161" REF="162">with <Q>you young ra&s;cal, I knew this would be the ca&s;e;</Q> then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me: <Q>I told the &s;coundrel to make up a <HI>vomit,</HI> and he has made up a <HI>purge:</HI></Q> and on my ob&s;erving, that had the one been &s;ent and admini&s;tered in|&s;tead of the other, the con&s;equences might have been fatal;&mdash;he an&s;wer|ed coolly, <Q>oh, no, not &s;o much for that,&mdash;the woman it's for, was to have been purged in the morning, and whether &s;he is purged to night and vomited to|morrow; or vomited to night and purged to-morrow, is very immaterial;&mdash;I am only angry
<PB N="162" REF="163">that the blockhead &s;hould not have followed my directions.</Q></P>
<P>THE reader may wonder how I came to be &s;o great a favourite, as to be let into the &s;ecrets of this pro|fe&s;&s;ion; but he mu&s;t know that my ma&s;ter had penetration enough to di&s;cern, in a very little time, that I had received a much better educa|tion than him&s;elf, and that I might be of great u&s;e to him: with this view, he took me into his confid|ence, and one day a&s;ked me, if I thought I could compile him a treati&s;e on nervous fevers? I told him, that my medical knowledge was but little; but, that if he would
<PB N="163" REF="164">put into my hands two or three books upon the &s;ubject, I was very &s;ure, that by twi&s;ting them and blending them together, I could, as apotheca|ries do their drugs, make up a new compo&s;ition, &s;o different from the original materials, that it &s;hould neither have the colour, the ta&s;te, or the con&s;i&s;tency of either, and yet &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the inherent properties of them all.&mdash;I did this for him, he put his own name to it and publi&s;hed it; and I have the vanity to think, that he acquir|ed no &s;mall degree of reputation from it.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="165">I wore a livery notwith&s;tanding; for, as he could not afford to keep more than one man &s;ervant, and as a livery was a nece&s;&s;ary appendage to a phy&s;ician, I was obliged to wear that livery. Many a one of this profe&s;&s;ion has found it nece&s;&s;ary to keep a chariot, who could not afford a joint of meat at his table. An equipage implies wealth; wealth is the con&s;equence of exten&s;ive practice, and exten&s;ive practice mu&s;t denote great medical knowledge; <HI>therefore,</HI> according to the rules of logic, an equipage denotes great me|dical knowledge and is, of cour&s;e, an e&s;&s;ential appendage to the character of a phy&s;ician.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="166">ANOTHER artifice my ma&s;ter made u&s;e of to give him con&s;e|quence in the town, was to be a member of the evening clubs, and my in&s;tructions were, before he had been twenty minutes at any one of them, to &s;end for him out, with, <Q>&s;uch a lady is taken &s;uddenly ill, and he mu&s;t make all the ha&s;te he can to be with her.</Q> He would apologize to his company for leav|ing them, explaining the nece&s;&s;ity, and from this club he would go to another, where in twenty minutes more, I would call him away with a &s;imilar tale, and he would then go to a third and &s;o on; and as I took care to want him for &s;ome per|&s;on
<PB N="166" REF="167">of con&s;equence; it did him much credit in the opinion of his acquaintance, and helped him on con&s;iderably in his practice. Many a time have I run into church pant|ing for breath, during the middle of &s;ervice, upon the &s;ame errand; and brought him from his knees in his mo&s;t <HI>fervent</HI> devotions.</P>
<P>MY ma&s;ter found it nece&s;&s;ary al&s;o to play into the hands of the apo|thecaries; they are always like the attornies to the coun&s;ellors, very good friends to the phy&s;icians. They have it in their power frequently to recommend whom they plea&s;e, and when they have brought a pa|tient
<PB N="167" REF="168">pretty near to death's door, they are willing to transfer the hon|our of killing him to a more able practioner; they will then advi&s;e a phy&s;ician to be called in, and in this ca&s;e, generally recommend tho&s;e, who &s;tudy mo&s;t the intere&s;t of the apothecary. 'Tis on this account, a phy&s;ician pre&s;cribes freely and pro|fu&s;ely, and drenches the poor pati|ent &s;o immoderately, as if he meant to wa&s;h away the evil &s;pirit by a deluge of mixtures: &s;o again, in|&s;tead of ordering an emul&s;ion, for example, in a pint bottle and two &s;poonfuls to be taken every three hours, for which at mo&s;t the apo|thecary can charge but two &s;hil|lings,
<PB N="168" REF="169">the doctor orders the &s;ame quantity in draughts, which will make eight, and at one &s;hilling each will pay the apothecary eight &s;hil|lings in&s;tead of two.</P>
<P>BY the&s;e and &s;uch like means, in a very few months, he had more bu&s;ine&s;s then he could attend to, and propo&s;ed to me to vi&s;it his poorer patients, for which I &s;hould have half the fees. It will readily be &s;uppo&s;ed that I accepted the offer, and with the idea of &s;tudying under him, and calling in his a&s;&s;i&s;tance if nece&s;|&s;ary, I had a great deal of employ. I learned his method of practice, which was mo&s;tly to attend to nature, and
<PB N="169" REF="170">a&s;&s;i&s;t her where it could be done. If a patient was inclined to &s;weat, we &s;weated him; if to purge, we purged him; if to vomit, we vomited him, and &s;o on; and if, by encrea&s;ing the&s;e evacuations too much, we &s;ometimes &s;ent one out of the world; yet, up|on the whole, we &s;aved a great many; and for tho&s;e whom we un|fortunately lo&s;t, we always found a friend on our &s;ide; for there is &s;eldom a per&s;on dies that is &s;o ill|beloved, but there is &s;ome one be|longing to him, that rejoices at his death, and is obliged to the phy&s;ici|an for &s;ending him out of a trouble|&s;ome world: be&s;ides, it is a phy&s;i|cian's
<PB N="170" REF="171">be&s;t comfort, that the dead cannot pro&s;ecute.</P>
<P>I HAD a &s;uit of cloaths made up for the purpo&s;e, which I occa&s;ion|ally put on; at other times, I ap|peared in livery; but, as my medi|cal dre&s;s made a great alteration in my appearance, the deception was never di&s;covered; e&s;pecially as I took care to put on a formal voice, with my formal dre&s;s.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING that thus I put a great deal of money in my pock|et, I mu&s;t own I had now and then my moments of remor&s;e: I was hurling
<PB N="171" REF="172">about me firebrands, arrows and death; and on my intimating my &s;cruples one day to my ma&s;ter, he rallied me out of them, with the following rea&s;oning. "Phy&s;icians," &s;ays he <Q>have been long held as u&s;eful members to &s;ociety, and if he who de&s;troys but five men in a community, does le&s;s injury to the &s;tate, than he who de&s;troys ten; then, he who de&s;troys but five, is the mo&s;t prai&s;e-worthy of the two: now, as it is univer&s;al|ly allowed that <HI>phy&s;icians</HI> do take away more lives than they &s;ave, and <HI>we</HI> &s;ave more than we take away, it follows that we are the better men, and the more u&s;eful
<PB N="172" REF="173">members of the &s;tate.</Q> Though this argument would have admitted of debate, yet as few care to rea|&s;on again&s;t their own intere&s;t, I &s;ub|mitted to my ma&s;ter's &s;uperior judgment, and continued my practice for a con&s;iderable time.</P>
<P>I WAS always very particular as to the &s;tate of tho&s;e patients I at|tended; and, if I could do not good, I was as careful, as I could be, to do no harm. Though I knew little of pul&s;es, like other phy&s;icans, I went through all the parade, counted each &s;troke with attention, and general|ly quitted the wri&s;t with a &s;ignifi|cant nod of &s;elf-approbation. Sick
<PB N="173" REF="174">per&s;ons are generally frightened and &s;eek for advice, when advice is not nece&s;&s;ary; &s;uch I would amu&s;e with a gilded pill made up of only com|mon dough, or a &s;aline draught, which, if they did no good, would do no harm; they would at lea&s;t leave the di&s;order to it&s;elf, and give the patient a chance of recovery; whereas others will by medicines throw back their patients, in order to lengthen their attendance and en|crea&s;e their fees: and I take merit to my&s;elf in this mode of practice, and am bold to &s;ay, was it more general, there would be a great de|crea&s;e in the burials of this king|dom.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="175">IT is allowed by &s;en&s;ible and di&s;|pa&s;&s;ionate men, that the modern practice of phy&s;ic is a farce&mdash;a far greater number are de&s;troyed by it than &s;aved. <Q>I thought, doctor, you was out of town,</Q> &s;aid a man to his phy&s;ician, <Q>by the de|crea&s;e of deaths in the la&s;t week's bills of mortality.</Q> Who enjoy a better &s;tate of health in general, than the poor, who cannot fee a phy&s;ician, or make it worth the apothecary's while to keep them long in hand? And could a fair compari&s;on be made, between the number of poor and rich that an|nually pay the debt of nature, it would certainly be found, that
<PB N="175" REF="176">length of life is three to one in fa|vour of the poor; notwith&s;tanding the labour; the hard&s;hips, and the ri&s;ks they are expo&s;ed to. Temper|ance is their phy&s;ician, and exerci&s;e their nur&s;e; and with an extra length of life, they enjoy whil&s;t they live, a greater degree of health.</P>
<P>HOWEVER Dr. Cadogan's doc|trine may be exploded, I dare a&s;&s;ert (and I &s;peak it from experience and ob&s;ervation) that intemperance de|&s;troys more than the &s;word, even in time of war. I mean intemper|ance in eating rather than in drink|ing. We arraign the conduct of
<PB N="176" REF="177">tho&s;e who drink to exce&s;s, and per|haps, becau&s;e we &s;ee its ill effects, whil&s;t we take little or no notice of tho&s;e who eat to a like exce&s;s; whereas in fact the glutton is a more &s;ordid wretch than the drunkard; and though intemperance in eating is not attended with that outward un|&s;eemline&s;s which accompanies ex|ce&s;s of drinking, yet, the former incapacitates the man as much for bu&s;ine&s;s and devotion, as the lat|ter. Conviviality, chearfulne&s;s, &s;pi|rits, cordial warmth, may be ex|cu&s;es for drinking more than ordin|ary, and if it intoxicates for a time, it corrects many di&s;orders brought on from accident, inattention to
<PB N="177" REF="178">diet and other things, &s;uch as flatu|lencies, crudities, &amp;c. whereas im|moderate eating, is attended with inactivity, heavine&s;s, &s;tupor, and le|thargy; not to mention the variety of di&s;orders it gives birth to, when we little expect it. Medical men, frequently pre&s;crible wine and cor|dials, which is exce&s;s drinking, asd re&s;toratives; but, I believe, no one ever thought of advi&s;ing a pati|ent to over eat him&s;elf. In &s;hort, gluttony is equally a &s;in with drunk|ne&s;s; yet though there are more gluttons than drunkards, we &s;el|dom heart of man's being cen&s;ured for the former.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="179">Fea&s;ting is now become a &s;tudy, and through the whole proce&s;s, we proceed methodically and with attention. It having been found that when the &s;pirits are up, we generally eat mo&s;t <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;tomach is &s;urrounded with a plexus of nerves, &s;o that whatever affects the mind, is pre&s;ently communicated to the &s;to|mach. I have known a piece of ill news brought at dinner-time, entirely take away the appetite of the per&s;on it was brought to: &s;o on the other hand, whatever tends to ex|hilerate the &s;pirits, adds to the appetice. Hence the introduction of mu&s;ick at fea&s;ts, and the cu&s;tom of eating in company, provocatives that end to often in the de&s;truction of the con|&s;titution.</NOTE>; care is taken to keep the &s;pirits up, by
<PB N="179" REF="180">company, by wine, by mu&s;ic; and when by the&s;e &s;timulants, we have almo&s;t eaten our&s;elves into a ferver; coffee is introduced by way of &s;e|dative or quieter of the &s;y&s;tem. Soon after tea is brought forward, and le&s;t the tea &s;hould prey upon the nerves of the un&s;trung, we have a rectifier for this. <HI>Mara&s;|chino</HI> or &s;ome other &s;trong cordial is handed round, and thus the ill effect of &s;ome things we eat is qualified or corrected by others. But to re|&s;ume my narrative.</P>
<P>WOULD men determine with them&s;elves to be as cautious in eat|ing as they are in drinking; that is,
<PB N="180" REF="181">ri&s;e from table before they are to full, their intellects would be clear, their bodies active, and they would enjoy much better health than they do. Were we to eat on|ly half the quantity we are accu&s;|tomed to, in a few years, remedies for the gout, cachexy, inflammation, and the long train of di&s;orders ar|&s;ing from indige&s;tion, would be ban|i&s;hed from our di&s;pen&s;aries, and men would live longer by ten or fifteen years. It is almo&s;t incredible to think, how little will &s;atisfy us. Lewis Cornaro, the Spaniard, lived one hundred and twenty years, and for the la&s;t &s;ixty years of his life, an egg &s;erved him for three meals: but he drank a pint of &s;mall wine every
<PB N="181" REF="182">day. This man, from abftemiou&s;ne&s;s in eating, was as active at ninety, as the generality of men are at forty. In &s;hort, ri&s;e from table with an ap|petite; never eat a thing that di&s;a|grees with you, or cau&s;es heart|burn; drink moderately, exerci&s;e freely; ri&s;e early, and go to bed early, and you may <Q>give phy&s;ic to the dogs.</Q></P>
<P>WHILST I was in this town I fortunately met with a file of new&s;|papers, three or four years back, and &s;earching for the occurrences of the time, when I had lived with Mr. Wildman, I di&s;covered this para|graph. <Q>The day before ye&s;ter|day the following accident hap|pened
<PB N="182" REF="183">in Berkley Square. Some villains di&s;gui&s;ed as chairmen, armed with deadly weapons, hav|ing, at the in&s;tance of a man of fa&s;hion, waylaid a gentleman's valet, with a view either of kind|napping him, or putting him to death, were fired at by the per&s;on they attempted to &s;eize, and one of them was killed on the &s;pot; the jury &s;at upon the body and bought in their verdict, <HI>&s;e de&s;en|dendo;</HI> or, that the per&s;on was killed in the &s;elf-defence. The gen|tleman's porter was &s;uppo&s;ed to be a party concerned, and was committed to Tothilfields pri|&s;on.</Q> This gave me a &s;atisfacti|on
<PB N="183" REF="184">I knew not how to expre&s;s; it relieved me from any danger I might dread from the event, and deter|mined me to re&s;ume the name I had taken up on leaving my native place; but, as I was known in my great wig at Sali&s;bury, by the name of Dr. Savage, I thought proper to go by that name, whil&s;t I there continued. Many an enquiry did I make at the Po&s;t-Office, in hopes of one day receiving an an&s;wer from Mi&s;s Wildman; but all to no pur|po&s;e; and as I met with no one that knew any thing of the family, I was &s;till in a &s;tate of &s;u&s;pence.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="185">WHILST I was in the &s;ervice of Dr. Bolus, which was upwards of two years, I became acquainted with the manager of a &s;trolling company, and from the account of the plea&s;|ant way of life they led, and the encouragement I met with from this man to join them, I was in|duced to try my abilities upon the &s;tage; and I was the more readily drawn into this attempt, from an unwillingne&s;s to commit any more murder.</P>
<P>INDEED, the following circum|&s;tance turned the laugh &s;o much again&s;t me, that I determined from that hour to quit the profe&s;&s;ion.

<P><PB N="188" REF="189">THE conduct of the college of phy&s;icians, hath as much hurt the credit of the profe&s;&s;ion as any thing in life; becau&s;e, they are au|thorized by an act of parliament to di&s;countenance any pretenders to phy&s;ic, and admit none to practi&s;e, but &s;uch as have been regularly bred, and of cour&s;e are &s;uppo&s;ed able to pa&s;s a good examination, they take the liberty to call upon all tho&s;e who are not members of our two Engli&s;h univer&s;ities, to take out a licence for the practice of phy&s;ic.

<HEAD>CHAP XV.</HEAD>
<P>THE company I was to join was not the be&s;t equipped in the world; the manager had met with misfortunes. In removing from Winche&s;ter to Sali&s;bury, the wag|gon conveying his wardrobe, &s;ce|nery, &amp;c. took fire from the dry|ne&s;s of the axle-trees, and de&s;troy|ed his whole <HI>property.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Property,</HI> in &s;tage language, implies all the apparatus of the theatre.</NOTE> and &s;ince this
<PB N="177" REF="198">di&s;a&s;ter, he had not been able to re|fit as before. He has come over to Sali&s;bury for a piece of water, a clound or two, and a few odd things, and was upon his return to Winche&s;|ter when he engaged me. He would have had me have made my appear|ance in tragedy; but, as farce was my forte, and as a player general|ly acquits him&s;elf be&s;t, in a part to which he has been accu&s;tomed, I determined to come out in the <HI>Mock Doctor,</HI> and as the character I had played of Dr. Savage, had furni&s;h|ed me with a dre&s;s, and his ward|robe was &s;mall, he the more readily con&s;ented. I &s;oon made my&s;elf ma&s;|ter of the part, and wi&s;hed only for an opporunity of &s;hewing him
<PB N="178" REF="199">what I could do. But the time was not come; for, though we had got to Winche&s;ter, which was to be our &s;cene of action, the company had not met.</P>
<P>IN the interim we had a great deal to do; we had not only our theatre to get ready, and &s;undry matters belonging to it to prepare, but we had an application to make to the mayor for leave to perform; and as he was a &s;trange kind of man, our manager reque&s;ted <HI>I</HI> would wait upon him for the purpo&s;e. He was an oilman by trade, as big round as one of his butts, had been exceedingly low bred, and was very proud of his office. When I entered
<PB N="179" REF="200">his &s;hop, he was &s;erving a woman with a penny-worth of pickles, and was wri&s;t-deep in the jar. On my telling him, <Q>I waited on him as mayor of the town;</Q>&mdash;he put his dirty hand to my mouth, with a <Q>Hold friend, not a word till I'm in the Ju&s;tice-room;</Q> &s;o &s;aying, having taken the money for his pickles, and wiped his hand on a filthy apron he had before him, he waddled into a back room, and de&s;ired me to follow him. When we were got into this place, which was &s;omething like a counting-hou&s;e, I began afre&s;h: <Q>I have taken the liberty, Sir,</Q>&mdash;but he again interrupted me with, <Q>Why friend, you're in a plaguy hurry.
<PB N="180" REF="201">&mdash;Let me get into my great chair fir&s;t.</Q>&mdash;I begged his wor&s;hip's pardon, &s;ubmitted to etiquette, and when he was fairly enthroned, I told him my bu&s;ine&s;s; that I was one of a company of players, ju&s;t arrived at Winche&s;ter, and that as I under&s;tood he was mayor of the Corporation, I waited on him, to reque&s;t his leave to perform. "Hark'ee, young man," &s;ays he, in a bellowing voice, <Q>though we civil Magi&s;trates are mortal ene|mies to any thing that looks like an armed force; I'd rather dye'&s;ee, &s;ee a parcel of &s;oldiers come in|to the town, than a parcel of playmen, to pick our pockets, and corrupt our wives and
<PB N="181" REF="202">daughters,</Q>&mdash;at the mention of the&s;e la&s;t words, his wife, who had been li&s;tening at the door, bolted into the room, and <Q>a&s;ked what bu&s;ine&s;s he was upon, that occa&s;ioned him to mention her.</Q> His wor&s;hip immediately &s;oftened: his tone, and replied, <Q>Nothing, my dear, that concerns your; it is only a parcel of play|men that want to play their rig in the town, and I wont' let 'em.</Q> <Q>Not <HI>let</HI> 'em, Mr. Gir|kin!</Q> retorts &s;he, <Q>and what's the matter you <HI>won't</HI> let 'em? If you want to be <HI>poplar</HI> you <HI>will</HI> let 'em, and there's nothing like being <HI>poplar,</HI> while one keeps &s;hop</Q> But, <Q>do you know,
<PB N="182" REF="203">my dear,</Q> returns his wor&s;hip, <Q>what a world o'harm the&s;e play|er-volks <HI>does?</HI></Q> <Q>A f&mdash;t of the harm,</Q> &s;ays &s;he, <Q>what's that to <HI>us?</HI>&mdash;It will keep families up late, and we &s;hall &s;ell more candles, and oil on that account.</Q> <Q>Why, &mdash;aye, to be &s;ure,</Q> replies the mayor, <Q>the <HI>is</HI> &s;omething in that.</Q>&mdash;<Q>What's the hour, Mr. Playerman, you mean to &s;how away?</Q>&mdash;About half after &s;ix, I told him, and end about half after ten. "No," &s;ays he, <Q>that's too &s;oon, &s;hops are &s;carce &s;hut by that time; make it <HI>&s;even</HI> and you &s;hall have my con&s;ent; for the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be over, before I can &s;uffer any may-games
<PB N="183" REF="204">to take place.</Q> I told his wor&s;hip we would obey his directi|ons; and turning round to thank Mrs. Girkin for her &s;ea&s;onable in|terference; &s;he gently &s;lapped me on the &s;houlder, wi&s;hed us &s;ucce&s;s, and told me, if we played Alex|ander the Great the fir&s;t night, &s;he would certainly be there, for &s;he loved Alexander to her life&mdash;he was &s;uch a <HI>proper</HI> man. As I was go|ing out at the door, his wor&s;hip bawled out,&mdash; <Q>Remember we &s;ell oil and candles.</Q></P>
<P>HAVING obtained permi&s;&s;ion to open our hou&s;e, our next bu&s;ine&s;s was to find one to open; for &s;ince our manager's misfortune, a fre&s;h
<PB N="184" REF="205">company had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town, and though the&s;e were play|ing at Southampton, it was not clear that we could have the u&s;e of their theatre. On enquiry we found it as we expected, and had another place to prepare. This bu|&s;ine&s;s delayed us &s;ome time, but it gave me an opportunity of learning a part or two to begin with, Alex|ander the Great exceeding the &s;trength of our forces; for, when we mu&s;tered them on paper, we could not make a greater number, men, women, and children, than fifteen. It was &s;ettled, therefore, that the fir&s;t piece got up &s;hould be <HI>Othello,</HI> or <HI>the Moor of Venice,</HI> and that I &s;hould take the part of the
<PB N="185" REF="206">Moor. Having a tolerable good memory, I became perfect in it &s;ooner than I expected, and our company dropped into town from different parts pretty nearly together. But our principal heroine had not made her appearance yet. Our ma|nager told me, &s;he belonged to a company in Buckingham&s;hire, and that he had &s;ome difficulty to en|gage her; however, he had happi|ly &s;ucceeded and &s;he would be his chief &s;trength; for &s;he was a very pretty woman and a good player both in tragedy and comedy, and had a very &s;weet pipe. She was to be my De&s;demona.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="207">WE &s;oon procured a tolerable room and &s;ufficiently large. It had been a carpenter's work&s;hop, and was quickly fitted up for our purpo&s;e. As this lady &s;ent us word that &s;he could not join us till the week after we had propo&s;ed to open, we deter|mined to commence without her, of cour&s;e I had only to play in the after-piece, and had time to get up two or three more parts. As I was a new performer, it was propo&s;ed by our manager, that on the nights I and this new woman performed, the profits of the hou&s;e &s;hould be divided into three parts, of which each of us &s;hould have one. This was a &s;pur to my indu&s;try, and I was de&s;irous to get up as many
<PB N="187" REF="208">characters as I could. Among the re&s;t were Romeo, Hamlet, Marplot, Archer, Benedict, and Bobadil.</P>
<P>THE entertainments given out for the fir&s;t night were, <HI>the Journey to London,</HI> and the <HI>Mock Doctor;</HI> and though we de&s;igned to begin at &s;e|ven, in compliment to the mayor, the hou&s;e did not fill till near eight; and &s;uch was our mi&s;fortune, that we were obliged to &s;tudy his wor|&s;hip's intere&s;t more than we intend|ed, for we could not begin till the hou&s;e was pretty nearly full, and &s;ufficient money was taken at the door, to relea&s;e our wardrobe from pawn. This circum&s;tance I was not made acquainted with, till the
<PB N="188" REF="209">hou&s;e was opened. However, good luck &s;tood our friend, we took eleven pounds pre&s;ently, and that did the bu&s;ine&s;s. The cloaths were brought in, and as our heads and legs were ready dre&s;&s;ed, we had only to &s;lip on the remainder. I was not in that predicament my|&s;elf, being dre&s;&s;ed in the character of Dr. Savage; yet I felt for the embarra&s;&s;ment of my friend the manager, and rejoiced with him at his delivery.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t night went off pretty well, no accident happening, but a piece of candle falling into the bu&s;hy part of Sir Francis's wig, which &s;et fire to it; and Mi&s;s Jenny being al|mo&s;t
<PB N="189" REF="210">pre&s;&s;ed to death by Count Ba&s;|&s;et, who was beat down flat upon her, by the fall of a hou&s;e, owing to the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of one of the &s;cene-&s;hifters. The con&s;equences, however, were no way fatal. The fire in Sir Francis's wig was &s;oon extingui&s;hed, by my lady's wrap|ping up his head in her wet hand|kerchief; for having a cold, her no&s;e had run profu&s;ely: and Mi&s;s Jenny gave us to under&s;tand, that there was no harm done to <HI>her,</HI> for as &s;he lay on her back, the count's weight was not more than &s;he could very well bear. It created a laugh in the hou&s;e, and the audience de|parted in good humour.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="211">It may be expected I &s;hould &s;ay &s;omething of my&s;elf, but mode&s;try enjoins me to &s;ay no more, than, <HI>Dr. Savage</HI> being only a <HI>mock-doctor,</HI> I was equally at home both in one part and the other. Whether it was owing to me or the other performers, I will not pretend to determine; but the farce was &s;o much liked, that we played nothing el&s;e for &s;ix &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive nights, and the hou&s;e was always full. It held &s;eventeen pounds, and as the expences were eleven, the manager put &s;ix in his pocket; but, not con&s;idering me yet as part of his e&s;tabli&s;hment, out of the&s;e &s;ix he gave me one, and as we performed three times a week, I thought it a great deal of money.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="212">FINDING we were likely to &s;uc|ceed, we enlarged our theatre, and made it hold twenty-&s;even pounds; and we added an additional fiddle to our band, which before con&s;i&s;ted only of two violins and a violin|cello; for we had it in contempla|tion to perform comic operas. Two of our company, indeed, could not &s;ing, but we had a plan to make up the deficiency. Whenever they had a &s;ong to &s;ing, they were to &s;tand pretty near the &s;ide &s;cenes, and a per&s;on without was to &s;ing it for them: we, by a &s;imilar contrivance, performed the Beggar's Opera, and the manager found me exceedingly u&s;eful, as I could cut down a play to any number of characters. Now,
<PB N="192" REF="213">there being more characters in this piece, than our &s;mall company could fill, I cut out all the whores and rogues but two of each &s;ort, being per&s;uaded, that in the&s;e wicked and expen&s;ive times, two rogues were enough to corrupt any man, and two whores &s;ufficient to ruin him.</P>
<P>THE week following our new heroine joined us, and never was I more amazed in my life; for who &s;hould this young lady be, but Mi&s;s Biddy Sla&s;h'em, the daughter of Dr. Sla&s;h'em of Highgate, where I was fir&s;t received on my journey towards London. It was on a Saturday evening that &s;he arrived, an evening that we did not perform, and the
<PB N="193" REF="214">manager, my&s;elf, and two or three of the principals, were regaling over a bowl of punch at a public hou&s;e. The manager was called out, in or|der to introduce her, and on her entering the room, the in&s;tant &s;he &s;aw me, &s;he flew into my arms with rapture, and the next moment, as in a paroxi&s;m of rage, &s;he caught hold of my ears, and &s;hook me, till I was obliged to bawl out for relief; then again, &s;he almo&s;t &s;mo|thered me with care&s;&s;es, and next bur&s;t into a flood of tears. It is natural to conceive, that this in|equality of conduct, this conflict of pa&s;&s;ions, this mixture of love and anger, mu&s;t have been my&s;terious to all pre&s;ent but to me. I was con|&s;cious
<PB N="194" REF="215">I had not treated her well, in omitting to corre&s;pond with her, and that for rea&s;ons the reader will by-and-by know. However, &s;he &s;oon recovered her&s;elf, apologi&s;ed to the company for her behaviour, &s;aid, I was the olde&s;t acquaintance &s;he had, and that her tran&s;ports in &s;ee|ing me, where &s;he &s;o little expected it, had totally confu&s;ed her.</P>
<P>DIFFERENCES being adju&s;ted, and matters of ceremony &s;ettled, our topics became general, rolled upon the &s;tate of the company, the &s;uc|ce&s;s we had met with, and our plan of operations in future; and towards the clo&s;e of the evening, the manager conceiving, as old ac|quaintance,
<PB N="195" REF="216">we might wi&s;h to be left, together; when the bowl was out, he propo&s;ed retiring, and left us to our&s;elves.</P>
<P>WE were no &s;ooner alone, but &s;he bur&s;t into tears again, upbraided me with my cruel conduct, declar|ed how much &s;he loved me, and &s;aid &s;he had &s;uffered greatly on my ac|count. I begged &s;he would &s;u&s;pend her opinion of my conduct, till &s;he had heard my &s;tory, which I would relate to her the fir&s;t opportunity; but that is was too long, and too in|tere&s;ting, to enter into, at &s;o late an hour in the evening. I a&s;ked her, if &s;he was provided with a lodging, &s;he replied, &s;he was, and hoped I
<PB N="196" REF="217">would breakfa&s;t with her in the morning; which having promi&s;ed to do, I conducted her home, and lift her.</P>

<P>THE next morning I waited on Mi&s;s Sla&s;h'em at her lodgings, and found her neatly and elegantly dre&s;&s;ed to receive me; &s;he was grown tall and &s;lender, and had a fire in her eye that I never ob&s;erved before. I could not help telling her, that I thought &s;he was grown very hand&s;ome, and that I was &s;orry to &s;ee her in no better
<PB N="198" REF="219">&s;ituation than my&s;elf, reduced for bread, to join a &s;trolling company of players. She in return told me, that her meeting with me, com|pen&s;ated for the rubs that &s;he had met with, and they were not a few. She reminded me of having promi&s;|ed to recount my &s;tory, and I told it as faithfully as I have laid it be|fore my readers, excepting my at|tachment, with the vows I had made to Mi&s;s Wildman, and an untruth or two I was obliged to tell, of having twice written to her an receiving no an&s;wer.</P>
<P>WHEN I came to that part of my &s;tory, re&s;pecting the accident at Mr. Wildman's door, &s;he corroborated
<PB N="199" REF="220">the paragraph I had read in the new&s;papers, and told me &s;he had &s;o far enquired, as to find, that the coroner's inque&s;t had acquitted me, and that the porter, though com|mitted to pri&s;on, as I did not appear again&s;t him, was di&s;charged at the following &s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>WHEN I had ended my &s;tory, which &s;he ob&s;erved, for the little time we had been &s;eparated, was the fulle&s;t of events &s;he had ever heard of, &s;he gave me her's in the following manner.</P>
<P><Q>YOU mu&s;t remember, my dear fellow, the critical &s;ituation you left me in: I concealed it as long

<PB N="202" REF="223">living witne&s;s of my &s;hame, and my father not likely to be at any further expence, after I was re|covered, he began to &s;often his brow, and to reconcile the mat|ter to him&s;elf; but never could be brought to look upon me again with that plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction he had formerly done. In &s;hort, the life I then led, determined me to quit it, whenever I had an opportunity, and this oppor|tunity &s;oon offered; for having a &s;trolling company in the vil|lage, which I heard were remov|ing, I wrote a note to the mana|ger, who was a &s;ingle man, and whom I had &s;een, to this effect.</Q></P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="203" REF="224">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A DAMSEL in di&s;tre&s;s &s;tands in need of protection; &s;he fancies, &s;he has abilities for the &s;tage, or for any thing; if you are inclin|ed to try them, and have &s;pirit enough to bring a ladder and carry her off &s;ecretly, you will find her at the one pair of &s;tairs window of the red hou&s;e, op|po&s;ite the lamp po&s;t, No. 119, on the road to London, on Friday morning next, between three and four o'clock.</P>
</LETTER>
<Q><P>FOR, as you know my mother u&s;ed to take the keys of the outer doors up into her room, I had no other way of e&s;caping. I
<PB N="204" REF="225">prepared every thing for my elopement, put up my cloaths in a bundle, and on the appointed morning, being ju&s;t break of day, I &s;tole down to the window; and though I doubted of &s;eeing the per&s;on I waited for, I no &s;ooner opened the &s;hutter, than I found my Ranger with a ladder ready, and with all the vivacity and &s;pir|it I could wi&s;h. He handed me out, and we got clear off. It was a fine morning, and we walked away for Hamp&s;tead, where he had provided me a retreat, hav|ing thrown the ladder over a hedge by the road &s;ide. Here he kept m&egrave; a week, and lived with me till his company removed to
<PB N="205" REF="226">St. Albans and we then fol|lowed.</P>
<P>YOUR good &s;en&s;e, my dear Gabriel, will forgive me this ra&s;h act. Could I have had <HI>your</HI> pro|tection, I would have preferred it to that of all the men in the world; but as you had de&s;erted me, and my life was wretched, from a per&s;ua&s;ion that it could not be more &s;o, I ventured upon the change. It was a bold enter|prize, as I was then &s;carce nineteen. Mr. Rider, for that was my friend's name, was a toler|able good player, took a great deal of pains with me, and made me capable of earning my living
<PB N="206" REF="227">before I had been three months with him; I came out at fir&s;t, in very tri&s;ling parts; but, before we left St. Albans, I had play|ed Juliet, De&s;demona, and two or three other capital characters, and acquitted my&s;elf &s;o well, that I began to think of &s;tanding upon my own bottom.</P>
<P>I HAD not been a great while at St. Albans, before my father found me out, and wrote to me. After condemning my conduct, and &s;ome few chidings, on that account, he proceeded to tell me, that if I would quit the way of life I was in, return home, and be u&s;eful about the hou&s;e, that
<PB N="207" REF="228">both he and my mother would receive me kindly:&mdash;but I re|turned him for an&s;wer, that I was making great proficiency in the profe&s;&s;ion I had taken up, and had the vanity to think, that, in a little time, I &s;hould be at the top of it. I thanked him for his offer, but I would rather con|tinue as I was; particularly as I could not be more di&s;graced than I had been, and as his cir|cum&s;tances were not &s;o great, but he could di&s;pen&s;e with a u&s;e|le&s;s per&s;on about him. After this letter, he left me to my&s;elf, and I never was importuned again upon the &s;ubject.&mdash;I have writ|ten to my mother once or twice
<PB N="208" REF="229">&s;ince, not to a&s;k any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but merely to enquire after her and my father; but, as I never could obtain an an&s;wer, I wrote no more. All I know is, that, on enquiry from a per&s;on who was lately in the neighbourhood, I find that they are both well, and that his &s;chool has very much encrea&s;ed.</P>
<P>I CONTINUED with Mr. Rider, upwards of three quarters of a year, when a circum&s;tance hap|pened that occa&s;ioned our &s;epar|ation. Whil&s;t I was at St. Al|bans, a linen-draper's apprentice, a good-humoured lad, took a lik|ing to me, and was ever behind
<PB N="209" REF="230">the &s;cenes, indu&s;triou&s;ly attentive to plea&s;e me; and as he was a generous youth, though with|out money, and would frequent|ly pre&s;ent me with a mu&s;lin handkerchief or two, half a doz|en pocket handkerchiefs, an apron and other nece&s;&s;ary articles, I found it my intere&s;t to keep in with him.&mdash;</P></Q>
<P><Q>NOT enquiring,</Q> interrupted I, <Q>how he came by them?</Q></P>
<P><Q>NOT I, indeed,</Q> continued &s;he, <Q>that was no part of <HI>my</HI> con|cern: I &s;uppo&s;e he paid his ma&s;|ter for them.&mdash;They were accept|able to me, and I took them,
<PB N="210" REF="231">and, when we removed to Hert|ford, this young man one Sun|day, came over to &s;ee me, at a time when Mr. Rider was from home, and not being able toget him away, &s;o &s;oon as I wi&s;hed, Mr. Rider returned, and entered the room unexpectedly at the mo|ment the poor boy was &s;queez|ing my hand in raptures. Mr. Rider grew jealous from this hour, and was &s;eldom after in a good-humour. I told him, there|fore, frankly, that I would con|tinue no longer with him, but leave him and his company to them&s;elves; I accordingly ap|plied to the manager of the Buckingham theatre, and as he
<PB N="211" REF="232">wanted a woman in my ca&s;t of parts, I immediately joined his company, at a &s;alary of four and twenty &s;hillings a week; and he, being a mu&s;ical man, taught me to &s;ing; &s;o that I am now a ge|neral player. Tragedy, comedy, opera, farce-nothing comes a|mi&s;s mi&s;s to me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>AND have you,</Q> &s;ay I, <Q>con|tinued with them till now?</Q></P>
<P><Q>WITH &s;ome little interruption,</Q> returned &s;he, <Q>I have. I went on pretty &s;moothly for the fir&s;t year; when an old quaker at Bucking|ham, who had more of the &s;in|ner in him than the &s;aint, and was
<PB N="212" REF="233">reputed to be very rich, invited him&s;elf to drink tea wich me at my lodgings; I received him and he made me a formal propo&s;al of taking me to live with him, with a</Q> <Q>Verily friend Sla&s;h'em, thou ha&s;t a leering eye and a bewitching form, that &s;tirreth my whole frame: I have been, &s;ince I &s;aw thee, in &s;uch an eternal figet, that I never &s;hall be again compo&s;ed, till thou conde&s;cendeth to make me happy.</Q> <Q>I gave him to under|&s;tand, that, in the profe&s;&s;ion I was in, I earned a great deal of mo|ney; that if he took me out of it, I &s;hould be a con&s;iderable lo&s;|er, for that I might find an un|willingne&s;s to return, and that, of
<PB N="213" REF="234">cour&s;e, I could not think of changing my &s;ituation, unle&s;s he would &s;ettle fifty pounds a year upon me, which he con&s;ented to, and I went home in a few days after to his hou&s;e;&mdash;you will &s;carce credit the a&s;&s;ertion; but, it is neverthele&s;s true, that quakers, notwith&s;tanding their outward formality and &s;tiffne&s;s, are as wanton as boys, and put on their formality only with their cloaths. Mr. Broadbrim, the gentleman I lived with, was about &s;ixty years of age, and very much re&s;pected among the brotherhood. I was dre&s;&s;ed like one of them, and pa&s;&s;ed for his hou&s;e-keeper, and might have continued long
<PB N="214" REF="235">with him, had not the friends began to &s;moke him, as they cal|led it, and found out who I was.</Q> <Q>Truly friend Broadbrim,</Q> <Q>&s;aid an old acquaintance to him one day, and which I overheard from the next room,</Q> <Q>thy hou&s;ekeeper &s;avoureth too much of the fle&s;h, and betrayeth an impurity that becometh not thy age and out|ward &s;anctity.</Q> <Q>Ebenezer,</Q> &s;aid Mr. Broadbrim to him, <Q>Let not thy tongue out-run thy di&s;cretion. Fle&s;h is &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary to cheer the &s;pirits and comfort the outward man. I can di&s;cover by thy eyes, that <HI>thou</HI> al&s;o ha&s;t thy wanton moments, and that though thy fle&s;h be weak, thy &s;pirit is
<PB N="215" REF="236">willing.</Q>&mdash;<Q>It was not always he could get off &s;o well; in &s;hort, he was &s;o laughed at by the young men, and jeered by the old, that he could not hold up again&s;t their ridicule, and hav|ing been threatened with an ex|pul&s;ion from the &s;ociety, which he dreaded more than any thing, he told me, one day, unwilling as he was, he mu&s;t part with me, but that the fifty pounds a year, I was welcome to keep; and if I did not expo&s;e him, he would be a friend to me whil&s;t he lived. I accordingly quitted him and re|turned to the way of life I was in before; joining the Bucking|ham company again, at my
<PB N="216" REF="237">former &s;alary; but, as my own mi&s;tre&s;s, with the addition of fifty pounds a year regularly paid every half year. Our manager dying &s;oon after, the company broke up and I am engaged here as you find me.</Q></P>
<P>I TOOK the liberty to a&s;k her &s;ome que&s;tions re&s;pecting the quakers; &s;he replied, <Q>that, indeed, &s;he did not know a great deal of them, having never conver&s;ed with any one of them till &s;he became ac|quainted with Mr. Broadbrim; but that he had an univer&s;al acquaint|ance among the fraternity, and they were frequently at his hou&s;e; that as far as &s;he could judge, they were
<PB N="217" REF="238">the greate&s;t di&s;&s;emblers in life, and that &s;he believed though they profe&s;&s;ed more candour and more &s;incerity than the re&s;t of the world, they at the &s;ame time had le&s;s of it; that &s;he knew it was a cu&s;tom among them to have fal&s;e bills of parcels to &s;hew to their cu&s;tomers, by which they a&s;certained their profit to be very &s;mall, when, in fact, it was very large, and under a pretence of dealing for di&s;count only, that di&s;count was twenty-five or thirty per cent. I know the Birming|ham manufacturers allow a di&s;|count of twenty-five per cent. upon their bills, for ready money, and if a retailer gets no more, he
<PB N="218" REF="239">gets a great deal too much.</Q> But, as my opinion of Mi&s;s Sla&s;h'em's judgment was but indifferent, I cea&s;ed making any further en|quiries.</P>
<P>SHE would fian have urged me to live in the &s;ame apartment with her; but, I excu&s;ed my&s;elf, under the declaration of being the mo&s;t incon&s;tant fellow alive, and the mo&s;t un&s;ettled; that it was uncer|tain whether I continued in the profe&s;&s;ion I was in, one month or twelve; but that whil&s;t I did, and that we were within reach of each other, I would &s;ee her, when &s;he plea&s;ed, and where &s;he plea&s;ed; and &s;hould always think my&s;elf happy
<PB N="219" REF="240">when I had it in my power to be of u&s;e to her.</P>
<P>IT may appear &s;trange that one upon the town as I was, &s;hould decline Biddy Sla&s;h'em's propo&s;al, who&s;e pur&s;e as well as per&s;on would have been at my command; but, the truth is, I hated a &s;ettled connexion. I will be hone&s;t enough to own, that I frequently yielded to the bent of human nature, and if I had occa&s;ionally a child or two &s;worn to me unju&s;tly, I com|promi&s;ed the matter with the pari&s;h where it was born on, the be&s;t terms I could, which &s;eldom exceeded ten pounds and a treat to the Over&s;eers of the poor. That
<PB N="220" REF="241">ten pounds will not bring a child up till it is able to get its living, we all know; but, the&s;e guardians of the infant poor, are charitable enough to remove it from a &s;inful world, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. At an enter|tainment I gave upon one of the&s;e occa&s;ions, the church-warden inti|mated, when half-drunk, that ten pounds was a good price for a ba&s;tard child, as wrapping it up a night or two in a wet blanket, &s;eldom failed of &s;ending it to Heaven pre&s;ently.</P>
