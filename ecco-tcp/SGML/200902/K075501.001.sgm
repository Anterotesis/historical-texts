<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the fir&s;t publication of this work, the author has annually enlarged and improved it. It mu&s;t occur to every one, that time only, and conti|nual reading, can add to the collection; which makes every new edition more valuable than the la&s;t. It has been the author's &s;tudy to examine into the accuracy of dates, and reconcile the difference of hi&s;torians, who vary in nothing more than in the times when events happened, owing to different com|mencements of the year with different people. The Jews began the year with the month of March; the Athenians, with June; the Macedonians, with the 24th of September; the Chri&s;tians of Egypt and Ethiopia, with the 29th or 30th of Augu&s;t; the Per&s;ians and Armenians, with the 11th of the &s;ame month; but mo&s;t chri&s;tians of the We&s;tern world reckon from the 1&s;t of January. Indeed, from the Roman Conque&s;t to Bede, time &s;eems to have been computed from Chri&s;tmas day. The Saxon chronicle begins the year from the birth of our Lord. At the beginning of the 13th century, &s;ome computed from the Annunciation, &s;ome from the Nativity, &s;ome from the Circumci&s;ion, and others from the Pa&s;&s;ion of our Lord; of cour&s;e, there was no fixed rule of computation in Gerva&s;e of Canterbury's time. Matt. Paris, Matt. We&s;tmin&s;ter, Ralph de Diceto, and Polydore Virgil, place the Coronation of William I. on Chri&s;tmas day, 1067. Hence it appears, that they began the year on that day. Wal&s;ingham and Brompton refer it to Chri&s;tmas day, 1066, which proves, that they did not begin the year till <HI>after</HI> that day. At the Reformation, the year was ap|pointed to begin on the 25th of March; but others &s;ay, in 1265; that being &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome, to have
<PB N="vi" REF="4">been the day when the world was created, and when Chri&s;t was conceived: it thus continued till 1752, when it was brought back to the 1&s;t of January. The Scots, from time immemorial, ob&s;erved the 25th of March as the fir&s;t day of the year, till Nov. 27, 1599; when the 1&s;t of January was or|dered, by proclamation, to be the beginning of the year there.</P>
<P>From the&s;e variations in the computation of time, re&s;pecting the commencement of the year, &amp;c. we may account for the difference of dates in the &s;everal hi&s;torians. It has been the &s;tudy, therefore, of the Author of this work, as far as po&s;&s;ible, to reconcile them; and he has happily &s;ucceeded in a thou&s;and in&s;tances, and in all he is as correct, as a work of this kind (which con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of figures) is capable of; he flatters him&s;elf, therefore, it will be found &s;uperior to other books of chronology, where no &s;uch attention has been paid. He has indu&s;triou&s;ly thrown out, al&s;o, all unimportant matter, and given the Reader only &s;uch occurrences as he mu&s;t wi&s;h to be acquainted with.</P>
<P>This work being found highly proper to be put into the hands of youth, chronology being one of the chief branches of the <HI>belles lettres;</HI> to adapt it for the purpo&s;e, this edition is publi&s;hed; wherein the author has given a more enlarged view of Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, and flatters him&s;elf he has thus rendered it a complete &s;chool-book. It is already received at We&s;tmin&s;ter, Eaton, Winche&s;ter, Marybone, &amp;c. &amp;c. and all other great &s;chools, as well for boys as for girls.</P>
<P>&rindx; A &s;mall edition of this work, &s;o contrived as not to exceed the &s;ize of a pocket almanack, may be had of all the book&s;ellers, price 1s. 6d.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE events of different reigns, as they aro&s;e, may be found, by turning to the re&s;pective kings one after another.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to dates, no notice is taken of the Old Stile, but they are regulated according to the New; thus January 1741/2, is called January, 1742.</P>
<P>As to ages, this rule is ob&s;erved; if a per&s;on at his death had entered only in his 40th year, he is recorded to have died, aged 39.</P>
<P>Names to which St. is prefixed, if not found by the fir&s;t letter of the name, may under the word Saint.</P>
<P>The times in which &s;uch writers lived, as were bi&s;hops, if not found in alphabetical order, may be &s;een by turning to the li&s;t of bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>Where no di&s;tinction of country is made to the peerages, that of England is implied.</P>
<P>Where references are made to <HI>Rem. Occur.</HI> it means to tho&s;e remarkable occurrences at the beginning of the Second Volume, which could not be &s;o well thrown into alphabetical order.</P>
<P>This volume &s;erves as a complete Index to all the Hi&s;tories of England extant, by referring to the years in which occurrences happened. The years are ge|nerally marked in the margins of the various hi&s;|tories.</P>
<P>Several hi&s;torical facts will be found, by referring to particular names in Vol. II.</P>
<P>The author will be very thankful for any cor|rections, additions, or improvements left with his publi&s;her, R. BALDWIN.</P>
