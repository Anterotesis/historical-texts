<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I CANNOT re&s;i&s;t the inclination this opportunity gives me of noticing how &s;incerely I rejoice that the tongue of malignity, which has &s;o opened again&s;t me on the &s;ubject of the&s;e &s;ongs, is likely to be com|pletely &s;ilenced.</P>
<P>Let it however be under&s;tood that, for any pri|vate unea&s;ine&s;s the &s;aucy &s;lander ever gave me, for any fear I entertained le&s;t it &s;hould depreciate me in the opinion of the judicious and the worthy, for any per&s;onal enmity I feel towards the mi&s;erable fools, who are puni&s;hed enough by the gnawings of their own rancour:&mdash;for any of the&s;e, or &s;imilar con&s;idera|tions, I &s;hould have &s;uffered the noi&s;ome &s;nuff to linger, till it became choaked in its own fetid dregs: but it has annoyed the public, and therefore it is my duty to put on the extingui&s;her.</P>
<P><PB REF="6">
The hi&s;tory of this bu&s;ine&s;s is very &s;imple and &s;elf-evident. I &s;tarted in life with &s;ome popularity, and therefore became an object of envy. Tho&s;e who were galled at my &s;ucce&s;s, endeavoured to cru&s;h me. They knew they could not do &s;o hone&s;tly, and there|fore they attempted it by villany. Public indigna|tion, however, &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed the reptiles, that they were glad to &s;link into their filthy lurking places for &s;afety.</P>
<P>From that time onward, till within the&s;e three years&mdash;being connected with managers and mu&s;ic-&s;hops, and working for mere hire&mdash;I lived pretty free from calumny. Throwing off every kind of yoke, however, and &s;tanding upon my own foundation&mdash;at which time I pledged my&s;elf that my productions &s;hould not, even in the minute&s;t degree, receive a&s;|&s;i&s;tance from either manager, author, or compo&s;er&mdash;the vipers began again to rear their heads; and many&mdash;to the reproach of manhood, and the di&s;honour of human nature&mdash;are the wanton and wicked proofs that they are only &s;cotehed, not killed.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="7">
This will be clearly evident if we notice that the medium through which they have attempted to emit their poi&s;on is a revival of the &s;ame &s;lander which was originally levelled again&s;t my reputation, and which only &s;hews that they have more wickedne&s;s than cun|ning. They fancy that, could they induce a general belief that I impo&s;ed upon the world the productions of &s;ome other per&s;on, as my own, I &s;hould be held as a man void of faith or honour; but what proper indignation mu&s;t fill every heart if it could be brought home to conviction that the principles of this per&s;on, of whom I am &s;uppo&s;ed to be merely the agent, are dete&s;ted, and his memory execrated!</P>
<P>Could this be maintained, it would cut two ways. It would hold me up, both profe&s;&s;ionally and morally, as an impo&s;tor, and &s;timulate the public not only to damn my works, but my character. Poor, &s;hallow-&s;ighted idiots! They indeed know nothing of the na|ture of public genero&s;ity. They have never ex|perienced that it con&s;tantly follows laudable indu&s;try; that it ever encourages tho&s;e endeavours which aim at conveying rea&s;onable plea&s;ure and u&s;eful in&s;truc|&s;ion;
<PB N="viii" REF="8">
and that whom it protects, it rai&s;es far above the reach of malice or detraction. They only know, fallen as they are, that it is a bli&s;s they dare not hope to enjoy, becau&s;e they are unworthy to po&s;&s;e&s;s it.</P>
<P>Having &s;poken of managers and mu&s;ic-&s;hops, it may not be improper to notice, that in &s;eparating my&s;elf from public connections, I am not actuated by any thing captious or capricious. I have no wi&s;h to cavil at men who have made bargains with me to their advantage. I cannot blame them for taking care of their intere&s;t, nor do I believe they blame me for taking care of mine: but, on the contrary&mdash;particu|larly tho&s;e with whom I have been mo&s;t connected&mdash;wi&s;h well to my pur&s;uits, and would lend my exertions every advantage in their power. Nor is there any thing wonderful in this; for it is a poor compliment to human integrity to &s;uppo&s;e that it is not very na|tural in us to a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e from whom we have received a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Putting out of the que&s;tion the ra&s;cality of my &s;landerers, I &s;hall next examine whether there is any|thing
<PB N="ix" REF="9">
like probability in their &s;lander; premi&s;ing, that I &s;hould not have conde&s;cended &s;o far but for the only circum&s;tance in all this bu&s;ine&s;s that gives me any thing like pain; and it is, that many men of &s;trict honour, and cordial good wi&s;hes towards me, have, even in my pre&s;ence, apparently given into &s;omething like a belief of what has been urged again&s;t me.</P>
<P>Such a leaven is there in the compo&s;ition of man, and &s;o captivating is a novel opinion, that I am afraid, &s;hould there be any malignity in it, there are very few who may not, under particular circum&s;tances, &s;uffer a momentary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of their integrity, to indulge an ab&s;urd curio&s;ity. I declare I have had &s;uch que&s;tions a&s;ked me, by even kind and worthy friends, that had I not known an anxious &s;olicitude had for an in&s;tant ob&s;cured probability, and outran re|flection, I mu&s;t, for the &s;ake of my honour, have &s;pit in their faces.</P>
<P>Nor is this language too &s;trong. In what way can the be&s;t friend make me amends for having in|dulgel, even for a &s;ingle moment, a belief that I am
<PB N="x" REF="10">
the wretch the&s;e execrable villains would fain de&s;cribe me? But my only revenge on tho&s;e who have been thus betrayed from their duty as men, and tricked out of their charity as chri&s;tians, &s;hall be to &s;hew upon how un&s;ub&s;tantial a foundation they have grounded their belief.</P>
<P>To go into this examination then. What is there in all we know of Mr. BICKERSTAFF to give the fainte&s;t colour to probability that he has written my &s;ongs, and that I always have been, and now am, his intimate friend? Is it becau&s;e whatever he has written and whatever I have written are of a totally different complexion? Does he write my &s;ea &s;ongs, becau&s;e tho&s;e in his <HI>Thomas and Sally</HI> are, taken technically, the ab&s;urde&s;t non&s;en&s;e that ever di&s;graced paper? Does the &s;pirit of my poetry bear the cha|racteri&s;tic of his, becau&s;e his was &s;tudy and mine is in|tuition? Becau&s;e he was timid, and I am bold? Be|cau&s;e what I write is temporary, and for the mo|ment, when he was the tardie&s;t and mo&s;t tedious of all writers? Did he, or could he, write any thing but &s;ongs? Do I write any thing but ballads? Have
<PB N="xi" REF="11">
I not uniformly rejected all a&s;&s;i&s;tance?&mdash;nay the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of much better poets than he&mdash;and did he not court a&s;&s;i&s;tance from any body who would lend it him? Were not the &s;ugge&s;tions of GOLDSMITH, KELLY, GARRICK, nay even SHUTER, and many others, caught at by him with avidity?</P>
<P>But did not the&s;e plain and &s;elf-evident facts laugh the a&s;&s;ertion to &s;corn, is it likely that a man, as he was, of the mo&s;t offen&s;ive and in&s;ufferable vanity, who never allowed the &s;malle&s;t &s;park of merit to his friends&mdash;no, not even in the moment they were lend|ing advantage to his productions&mdash;is it probable that &s;uch a man, notwith&s;tanding the merited obloquy a di&s;cerning and virtuous public has properly heaped on his head, would not manife&s;t in &s;ome way his title to a &s;hare in my popularity? Or, to take it the other way, what &s;trange incon&s;i&s;tency, or what &s;ingular atrocity, has &s;o marked my public career as to make me appear on one &s;ide &s;uch a fool, and on the other &s;uch a knave, as to ri&s;k being fir&s;t di&s;covered, and afterwards betrayed, by the man of all others the mo&s;t capable of &s;uch conduct?</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="12">
Again, what are the fa&s;cinating qualities in Mr. BICKERSTAFF that &s;hould induce me to imitate him as a man, and ri&s;k public benevolence for private in|famy? Am I impelled by gratitude in return for his driving hard bargains with me; of his taking ad|vantage of my inexperience, and rewarding me with a trifle, for labours by which he got large &s;ums of money; for being continually unfaithful to his en|gagements, or for running away in my debt? Am I enamoured of that in&s;incerity for which he was re|markable and notorious?&mdash;for that profligacy and immorality which characteri&s;ed his opinions?&mdash;for that &s;upercilious hauteur through which he would affront his friends?&mdash;or the pu&s;illanimity which terri|fied him into begging their pardon! The climax of this paragraph I will not &s;tain my paper with. My heart does not tell me that any &s;ingle di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate man upon earth will accu&s;e me of an inclination to emulate the above qualities, and I flatter my&s;elf I &s;hall not ea&s;ily be &s;u&s;pected of pre-eminence in iniquity. And now let my calumniaters, with their u&s;ual truth and con&s;i&s;tency, a&s;&s;ert that this is a panegyric on Mr. BICKERSTAFF, and that he wrote it!</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="13">
But this dare not now be ventured. The public indignation is once more rou&s;ed, and woe to tho&s;e who have provoked it! My cau&s;e is become the cau&s;e of every hone&s;t man in the kingdom. Every man's honour, every man's character, and every man's intere&s;t is involved in it. It is not now a que&s;|tion whether, in common with hundreds of high di&s;tinction, brilliant talents, and un&s;potted honour, I &s;hall, with indifference and contempt, &s;ee the lie of the day levelled at me, but it is a que&s;tion whether, as an innocent man, I &s;hall be protected by &s;ociety, or, as a perjurer, driven from it.</P>
<P>This &s;lander became at length &s;o rank, &s;o &s;hame|le&s;s, and was &s;o univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed, that, in ju&s;tice to my&s;elf as a man and a citizen, I have appealed to the laws of my country. Di&s;daining to proceed other|wi&s;e than by indictment, I have been granted a rule to &s;hew cau&s;e why an information &s;hould not be filed again&s;t the per&s;on who has thought proper to libel me; and, to obtain that rule, I have &s;worn <Q REND="inline">"that I have not, at any time, &s;een Mr. BICKERSTAFF, nor had any
<PB N="xiv" REF="14">
corre&s;pondence with him, &s;ince he ab&s;conded, and that I know not whether he be alive or dead."</Q></P>
<P>The matter is therefore now brought to a mo&s;t &s;erious and &s;olemn point. My reputation is in the hands of the public, and every man of virtue and ho|nour mu&s;t pronounce for me, that no one, but an un|principled villain, will hereafter dare to mention my name coupled with any in&s;inuation of the nature I complain of, unle&s;s he &s;hall not only accu&s;e me, but convict me, of perjury.</P>
<P>I have written this preface at the &s;olicitation and for the &s;atisfaction of tho&s;e many friends who&s;e warm and kind anxiety &s;hall be remembered by me while my heart feels that gratitude which is its &s;weete&s;t and deare&s;t &s;en&s;ation. In the cour&s;e of it I have carefully &s;tudied not to anticipate nor prejudge any thing before the court. I have only given an unqualified contradiction of what has been alledged again&s;t me, and maintained my po&s;ition by &s;uch probable circum&s;tances as &s;ug|ge&s;ted them&s;elves. This it was particularly my duty
<PB N="xv" REF="15">
to do, on bringing out the&s;e &s;ongs; but I have not pre&s;umed to teach, or dictate. The &s;ubject is open to liberal di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. It is here at i&s;&s;ue, as well as at the King's-bench; and I am neither a&s;hamed nor afraid of what may be the deci&s;ion in either place.</P>
