<P>I Suppo&s;e every Body is &s;ufficiently appriz'd of, and duly prepar'd for the famous Conjunction to be celebrated the 29th of this In&s;tant <HI>December,</HI> foretold by all the Sages of Antiquity, under the Name of the <HI>Annus Mirabilis,</HI> or the <HI>Metamorpho&s;tical</HI> Conjunction; a Word which denotes the mutual Transformation of Sexes, the Effect of that Configuration of the Cele&s;tial Bodies; the human Males being to be turned into Females, and the human Females into Males. As to Brutes, Antiquity is divided; nor will I interpo&s;e among&s;t tho&s;e eminent Per&s;onages, or anticipate what the Event of a few Days will determine.</P>
<P>The <HI>Egyptians</HI> have repre&s;ented this great Transformation by &s;e|veral very &s;ignificant Hieroglyphicks, particularly one very remarka|ble. There are carv'd upon an Obelisk, a <HI>Barber</HI> and a <HI>Midwife;</HI> the Barber delivers his Razor to the Midwife, and &s;he her Swadling Cloaths to the Barber.</P>
<P>Accordingly <HI>Thales Mile&s;ius</HI> (who, like the re&s;t of his Country|men, borrow'd his Learning from the <HI>Aegyptians</HI>) after having com|puted the Time of this famous Conjunction, <HI>Then,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>&s;hall Men and Women mutually exchange the Pangs of Shaving and Child|bearing.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3">
<HI>Anaximander</HI> mode&s;tly de&s;cribes this Metamorpho&s;is in Mathema|tical Terms: <HI>Then,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>&s;hall the negative Quantity of the Wo|men be turn'd into po&s;itive, their &minus; into &plus;;</HI> (i. e.) their <HI>le&s;s</HI> into <HI>more.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Plato</HI> not only &s;peaks of this great Change, but de&s;cribes all the Preparations towards it. <Q REND="inline">"Long before the bodily Transformation (&s;ays he) Nature &s;hall begin the mo&s;t difficult Part of her Work, by changing the Ideas and Inclinations of the two Sexes; Men &s;hall turn effeminate, and Women manly; Wives &s;hall domineer, and Husbands obey; Ladies &s;hall ride a Hor&s;eback, dre&s;s'd like Cavaliers; Princes and Nobles appear in Night-trails and Petticoats; Men &s;hall &s;queak upon Theatres with Female Voices, and Wo|men corrupt Virgins; Men &s;hall knot and cut Paper; and even the <HI>Northern</HI> People, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">: A Phra&s;e (which for Mode&s;ty's Sake I forbear to tran&s;late) which denotes a Vice too frequent among&s;t us."</Q> So far <HI>Plato.</HI></P>
<P>Nor was our own <HI>Merlin</HI> ignorant of this Transformation; wit|ne&s;s that my&s;terious Stanza of his, the Meaning of which is now plain.<Q><L><HI REND="blackletterType">Then a Mini&s;try full wi&s;e,</HI></L>
<L><HI REND="blackletterType">When they have &s;poil'd the Plotter's Guize,</HI></L>
<L><HI REND="blackletterType">Shall hang a Man right quickely,</HI></L>
<L><HI REND="blackletterType">Before he can plead his Bell&mdash;y.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>That the Mini&s;try fore&s;aw this great Change, is plain from the <HI>Callico-Act;</HI> whereby it is now become the Occupation of the Wo|men all over <HI>England,</HI> to convert their u&s;ele&s;s Female Habits into Beds, Window-Curtains, Chairs, and Joint-&s;tools; undre&s;&s;ing them|&s;elves (as it were) before their Transformation.</P>
<P>The Philo&s;ophy of this Transformation will not &s;eem &s;urprizing to People, who &s;earch into the <HI>Bottom</HI> of Things. Madam <HI>Bourignon,</HI> a devout <HI>French</HI> Lady, has &s;hewn us, how Man was at fir&s;t created Male and Female in one Individual, having the Faculty of Propaga|tion within him&s;elf: A Circum&s;tance nece&s;&s;ary to the State of Inno|cence, wherein a Man's Happine&s;s was not to depend upon the Ca|price of another. It was not till after he had made a <HI>faux pas,</HI> that he had his Female Mate, (fir&s;t join'd to him as the <HI>Bohemian</HI> Girls were join'd, and then &s;eparated.) Many &s;uch Tran&s;|formations of Individuals have been well atte&s;ted; particularly one by <HI>Montaigne,</HI> and another by the late Bi&s;hop of <HI>Salisbury.</HI> From all which it appears, that this Sy&s;tem of Male and Female has alrea|dy undergone, and may hereafter &s;uffer &s;everal Alterations. Every Smatterer in Anatomy knows, that a Woman is but an introverted Man; a new Fu&s;ion and <HI>Flatus</HI> will turn the hollow Bottom of a Bottle into a Convexity; but I forbear, (for the Sake of my Men Readers, who are in a few Days to be Virgins.)</P>
<P>In &s;ome Subjects, the &s;malle&s;t Alterations will do; &s;ome Men are &s;ufficiently &s;pread about the Hips, and contriv'd with that Female Softne&s;s, that they want only the Negative Quantity to make them Buxon Wenches; and there are Women who are, as it were, al|ready the <HI>Ebauche</HI> of a good &s;turdy Man. If Nature cou'd be puzzl'd,
<PB N="3" REF="4">
it will be how to be&s;tow the redundant Matter of the exuberant Bubbies that now appear about Town, or to roll out the &s;hort dap|per Fellows into well-&s;iz'd Women.</P>
<P><HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> has with great Nicety determin'd the Ca&s;e of Eunuchs and Hermophrodites. <HI>The fir&s;t,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>will be transform'd into Bar|ren Women,</HI> (I &s;uppo&s;e he means like a &s;pay'd Hen.) <HI>The &s;econd will change their predominant Inclination:</HI> I am glad of this Cir|cum&s;tance of Eunuchs, becau&s;e the Opera will not be interrupted by their big Bellies.</P>
<P>This great Conjunction will begin to operate on <HI>Satur|day</HI> the 29th In&s;tant. Accordingly, about Eight at Night, as <HI>Senzino</HI> begins, <HI>Si videte, Did you but &s;ee?</HI> He &s;hall be ob&s;erv'd to make an unu&s;ual Motion; upon which the Audience will be af|fected with a red Suffu&s;ion over their Countenance: And becau&s;e a &s;trong Succu&s;&s;ion of the Mu&s;cles of the Belly is nece&s;&s;ary towards performing this great Operation, both Sexes will be thrown into a profu&s;e involuntary Laughter; then (to u&s;e the mode&s;t Terms of <HI>Anaximander</HI>) &s;hall negative Quantity be turn'd into po&s;itive, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Time never beheld, nor will it ever a&s;&s;emble &s;uch a Number of un|touch'd Virgins within tho&s;e Walls; but alas! &s;uch will be the Im|patience and Curio&s;ity of People to act in their new Capacity, that many of them will go to Pot that very Night. To prevent the Di&s;orders that may happen upon this Occa&s;ion, is the chief De&s;ign of this Paper.</P>
<P>Gentlemen have begun already to make u&s;e of this Conjunction to compa&s;s their filthy Purpo&s;es. They tell the Ladies for&s;ooth, that it is only parting with a peri&s;hable Commodity; hardly of &s;o much Va|lue as a Callico Under-petticoat, &s;ince, like its Mi&s;tre&s;s, it will be u&s;e|le&s;s in the Form it is now in. If the Ladies have no Regard to the Di&s;ho|nour and Immorality of the Action, I de&s;ire they will con&s;ider that Nature, who never de&s;troys her own Productions, will exempt big-bel|ly'd Women till the Time of their Lying-in; &s;o that not to be tran&s;|form'd, will be the &s;ame as to be pregnant. If they don't think it worth while to defend a Fortre&s;s that is to be demoli&s;h'd in a few Days, let them reflect that it will be a melancholly thing Nine Months hence, to be brought to Bed of a Ba&s;tard; a po&s;thumous Ba&s;tard as it were, to which the <HI>Quondam</HI> Father can be no more than a dry Nur&s;e.</P>
<P>This wonderful Transformation is the In&s;trument of Nature, to balance Matters between the Sexes. Then &s;hall the Cruelty of &s;corn|ful Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es be return'd, and they forc'd to &s;ue to their new form'd Lovers with yet &s;tronger De&s;ires: Happy Lovers &s;hall repay in kind the Favours they have receiv'd, and be as ble&s;s'd as their fellow Worms of the Earth, who (contemptible as they &s;eem) are fram'd by Nature to enjoy both Plea&s;ures. The &s;lighted Maid &s;hall grow into an imperious Gallant, and reward her Undoer with a big Belly, and a Ba&s;tard. The Coquette Wife &s;hall turn the jealous Husband; and every Individual &s;hall be able to decide the Que&s;tion &s;o much di&s;|puted, concerning the comparative Delights of the Sexes.</P>
<P>It is hardly po&s;&s;ible to imagine the Revolutions that this wonderful Phaenomenon will occa&s;ion over the Face of the Earth. I long impatient|ly to &s;ee the Proceedings of the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> as to the Title of
<PB N="4" REF="5">
Succe&s;&s;ion to their Crown; this being a Ca&s;e not provided for by the <HI>Salique</HI> Law. There will be no preventing Di&s;orders among&s;t Friars and Monks; for certainly Vows of Cha&s;tity don't bind but under the Sex in which they were made. The &s;ame will hold good with Marriages, tho' I think it will be a Scandal among&s;t Prote&s;tants for Husbands and Wives to part, &s;ince there remains &s;till a po&s;&s;ibility to perform the <HI>Debitum Conjugale</HI> by the Husband being <HI>femme Couverte.</HI> I &s;ubmit it to the Judgment of the Gentlemen of the Long Robe, whether this Transformation does not di&s;charge all Suits of Rapes?</P>
<P>The Pope mu&s;t undergo a new groping; but the fal&s;e Prophet <HI>Mahomet</HI> has contriv'd Matters well for his Succe&s;&s;ors; for as the Grand Signior has now a great many fine Women, he will then have as many fine young Gentlemen at his Devotion.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;urprizing Scenes, but I beg leave to affirm, that the &s;olemn Operations of Nature are Subjects of Contemplation, but not of Ridicule; therefore I make it my earne&s;t Reque&s;t to the merry Fellows, and giggling Girls about Town, that they would not put them&s;elves in a high Twitter, when they go to vi&s;it a General Ly|ing-in of his fir&s;t Child; his Officers &s;erving as Midwives, Nur&s;es and Rockers, di&s;pen&s;ing Caudle; or if they behold the Reverend Prelates dre&s;&s;ing the Heads and airing the Linnen at Court, I beg they will remember that the&s;e Offices mu&s;t be fill'd with People of the greate&s;t Regularity, and be&s;t Characters. For the &s;ame Rea|&s;on, I am &s;orry that a certain Prelate, who notwith&s;tanding his Con|finement, &s;till pre&s;erves his healthy, chearful Countenance, cannot come in time to be a Nur&s;e at Court.</P>
<P>I likewi&s;e earne&s;tly intreat the Maids of Honour, (then En&s;ign and Captains of the Guards,) that at their fir&s;t &s;etting out, they have &s;ome Regard to their former Station; and not run wild through all the infamous Hou&s;es about Town. That the pre&s;ent Grooms of the Bed-Chamber (the Maids of Honour) would not eat Chalk and Lime in their Green-Sickne&s;s: And in general, that the Men would remember that they are then become <HI>Retromingent,</HI> and not by In|advertency lift up again&s;t Walls and Po&s;ts. Petticoats will not be burden&s;ome to the Clergy; but Balls and A&s;&s;emblies will be inde|cent for &s;ome Time.</P>
<P>As for you, Coquettes, Bawds, and Chambermaids, (the future Mini&s;ters, Plenipotentiaries and Cabinet-Coun&s;ellors to the Princes of the Earth,) manage the great Intrigues that will be committed to your Charge, with your u&s;ual Secrecy and Conduct; and the Affairs of your Ma&s;ters will go better than ever.</P>
<P>O ye <HI>Exchange</HI> Women (our Right Wor&s;hipful Repre&s;entatives that are to be) be not &s;o griping in the Sale of your Ware as your Predece&s;&s;ors, but con&s;ider that the Nation, like a &s;pend-thrift Heir, has run out: Be likewi&s;e a little more continent in your Tongues than you are at pre&s;ent, el&s;e the Length of Debates will &s;poil your Dinners.</P>
<P>You Hou&s;ewively good Women, who now pre&s;ide over the Con|jectionary, (henceforth Commi&s;&s;ioners of the <HI>Trea&s;ury</HI>) be &s;o good as to di&s;pen&s;e the Sugar Plumbs of the Government with a more impartial and frugal Hand. Ye Prudes and cen&s;orious old Maids, (the Hopes of the <HI>Bench</HI>) exert but your u&s;ual Talent of find|ing Faults, and the Laws will be &s;trictly executed; only I would
<PB N="5" REF="6">
not have you proceed upon &s;uch &s;lender Evidences as you have done hitherto. It is from you, eloquent Oy&s;ter-Merchants of <HI>Billing&s;gate,</HI> (ju&s;t ready to be call'd to the Bar, and quoif'd like your Si&s;ter-Ser|jeants,) that we expect the &s;hortening the Time, and le&s;&s;ening the Expences of Law-Suits: For I think you are ob&s;erv'd to bring your Debates to a &s;hort I&s;&s;ue; and even Cu&s;tom will refrain you from ta|king the Oy&s;ter, and leaving only the Shell to your Clients. O ye Prie&s;ts, who now in a clande&s;tine Way exerci&s;e your Office of coupling, when you continue your Practice in a lower Sphere, I que&s;tion not but you will be more &s;ucce&s;sful than you have been hitherto, in plea&s;ing both Parties. O ye Phy&s;icians, who in the Figure of old Women are to clean the Tripe in the Markets; &s;cour it as effectually as you have done that of your Patients, and the Town will fare mo&s;t deliciou&s;ly on <HI>Saturdays.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot but congratulate human Nature, upon this happy Tran&s;|formation; the only Expedient left to re&s;tore the Liberties and Tran|quility of Mankind; which is &s;o evident, that it is almo&s;t an Affront to common Sen&s;e to in&s;i&s;t upon the Proof it. If there can be any &s;uch &s;tupid Creature who doubts of it, I de&s;ire he will make but the fol|lowing obvious Reflection: There are in <HI>Europe</HI> alone, at pre&s;ent, about a Million of &s;turdy Fellows, under the Denomination of &s;tand|ing Forces, with Arms in their Hands: That tho&s;e are Ma&s;ters of the Lives, Liberties and Fortunes of all the re&s;t, I believe no body will deny. It is no le&s;s true in Fact, that Reams of Paper, and above a &s;quare Mile of Skins of Vellum have been employ'd to no Purpo&s;e, to &s;ettle Peace among&s;t tho&s;e Sons of Violence. Pray, who is he that will &s;ay unto them, <HI>Go and di&s;band your &s;elves?</HI> But lo! by this Transformation it is done at once, and the <HI>Halcyon</HI> Days of publick Tranquillity return. For neither the military Temper nor Di&s;cipline can taint the &s;oft Sex for a whole Age to come. <HI>Bellaque matribus invi&s;a, Wars odious now to Mothers,</HI> will not grow imme|diately palatable in their Paternal State.</P>
<P>Nor will the Influence of this Transformation be le&s;s in Family-Tranquillity than it is in National. Great Faults will be amended, and Frailties forgiven on both Sides. A Wife who has been di|&s;turb'd with late Hours, and choak'd with the Hautgo&ucirc;t of a Sot, will remember her Sufferings, and avoid the Temptation; and will, for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, indulge her Mate in his female Capacity in &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ions, which &s;he is &s;en&s;ible from Experience are natural to the Sex. Such as Vanity of fine Cloaths, being ad|mir'd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And how tenderly mu&s;t &s;he u&s;e her Mate under the breeding Qualms and Labour-Pains, which &s;he felt her &s;elf? In &s;hort, all unrea&s;onable Demands upon Husbands mu&s;t cea&s;e, becau&s;e they are already &s;atisfy'd from natural Experience that they are impo&s;&s;i|ble. That the Ladies may govern the Affairs of the World, and the Gentlemen tho&s;e of their Hou&s;hold, better than either of them have hither done, is the hearty De&s;ire of,</P>
